omprehensive evaluation of retinal health prior to and following cataract surgery is critical to supporting optimal outcomes. 
 
In addition to the importance of identifying retinal pathology that may prevent or delay cataract surgery, continuous advances in 
refractive intraocular lens technology and cataract surgical technique, coupled with increasingly high expectations regarding visual 
 
outcomes among younger patients, make the consideration of long-term quality of vision paramount in the cataract assessment. Optos® ultra-
widefield retinal imaging supports this clinical objective by providing imaging standardization in a streamlined, patient-friendly exam process, 
supporting robust documentation that facilitates mapping of disease progression, and offering potential economic advantages in a resource-
constrained environment.

Due in part to continuous improvement in the safety, speed, and refractive outcomes of cataract 
surgery, the number of cataract procedures has increased steadily over the past 30 years, and the 
percentage of patients undergoing the procedure at a younger age is also increasing. These trends 
were documented in a frequently cited population-based study of Omsted County, Minnesota, that 
compared rates of cataract surgery between 2005 and 2011 to those in the prior 25 years. Data on 
more than 8,000 cataract procedures in the most recent period revealed that the incidence of cataract 
surgery had increased significantly, the interval between first and second eye surgery narrowed 
significantly, and 19% of patients elected cataract surgery before age 65.1 This rise in cataract surgery 
rates will continue to accelerate as the US population ages; the number of Americans over age 65 is 
expected to nearly double by 2050, to 83.7 million.2
Along with the increasing volume driven by this large demographic wave, there are a number of 
important implications of the shift to earlier cataract surgery and the increasing use of sophisticated 
premium intraocular lens (IOL) technologies. Perhaps the most significant of these is that many 
patients will live for decades after the procedure. These patients have high expectations of their 
immediate postoperative visual outcomes and also expect to continue to see well as they age. With 
sustained quality of vision the main therapeutic objective, it has become paramount to perform 
thorough retinal exams pre-surgically and postoperatively to identify pre-existing retinal disease 
that might prevent, delay, or alter surgery, to anticipate future retinal problems—particularly to the 
degree that this prospect may affect lens choice—and to provide an initial, post-cataract baseline 
for monitoring future pathological changes. In this review, we will describe the integration into our 
pre- and post-cataract surgery assessments of a specific imaging technology that has shown utility 
in retinal disease detection and management for both the general ophthalmologist and the retinal 
specialist. In our experience, ultra-widefield (UWF™) retinal imaging (Optos plc., Dunfermline, Scotland) 
and the clinical and practical value of the high-resolution, digital optomap® images they produce, have 
complemented the information available to us from standard approaches, including conventional 
fundus examination and optical coherence tomography (OCT), thereby improving our ability to rapidly 
and accurately identify retinal pathology, facilitating consultation with retina colleagues, and resulting 
in enhanced patient care, increased patient satisfaction, and greater efficiency within our practices. 
As a result, Optos® UWF retinal imaging has become a routine component of perioperative evaluation 
in our cataract cases, based on the unique advantages of the technology, and we believe that other 
cataract practices may benefit from considering this approach.

Perspective  Imaging in Cataract Care
Relevant capabilities of ultra-widefield retinal 
imaging for the cataract practice
As occurred with the introduction of OCT, now an essential tool in many 
cataract practices, UWF retinal imaging is providing new capabilities that 
are helping to evolve the standard of care. Several platforms for examining 
the retinal periphery have been developed, including the portable, 
contact-based RetCam (Natus Medical, Plesanton, California, US) and 
contact (Staurenghi retinal lens—Ocular Instruments, Washington, US) 
and non-contact lens additions to the Heidelberg Spectralis (Heidelberg 
Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany), but the Optos systems offer the 
maximum field of view of any available retinal imaging device.3 Optos 
UWF devices are also easier to use and capture images more quickly than 
other platforms. A single, non-contact capture can show 200-degrees 
or 82% of the retina, often extending beyond the vortex veins and 
equator. A number of studies have confirmed that Optos UWF imaging 
helps clinicians identify pathology associated with a wide array of retinal 
diseases, including non-infectious uveitis and vasculitis, that can be 
missed with conventional imaging techniques.4–6 A review of data from 
more than 3 years of research with UWF imaging confirmed that that 
66% of clinically relevant retinal pathology is found outside the reach of 
conventional fundus photography.7
In our perioperative assessments, the functional capabilities of Optos 
systems make UWF imaging a useful adjunct to OCT and other standard 
examination tools, particularly in providing an efficient way to examine 
the retinal periphery. Each system is built around two low-power 
lasers and purpose-built optical technology that permit high-resolution 
image capture through a pupil as small as 2 mm. Since mydriasis is 
not necessary for excellent visualization, imaging is possible in eyes 
that cannot be dilated, such as those with anatomic narrow angles, 
pseudoexfoliation, iris trauma, or uveitis. Considering that many cataract 
patients are somewhat more light sensitive during the preoperative 
time period and given the relatively high frequency with which dilated 
fundus evaluations occur in such patients (for further assessment of 
dysphotopsias, floaters, visual blur or just routine surveillance), the 
potential benefits of UWF imaging, including screening sensitivity and 
efficiency, may be further amplified in this particular group. From the 
clinician’s perspective, conventional retinal imaging can be challenging 
in patients with cataracts due to light scatter off the cataract. However, 
the Optos system scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) technology 
can effectively penetrate most media opacities, allowing adequate 
visualization through cataracts, vitreous hemorrhages, corneal scars, 
and gas bubbles or silicone oil (see Figure 1). 
The sensitivity and clinical value of UWF retinal imaging technology 
in the identification and assessment of diabetic retinopathy is well 
documented.8–11 It has also been evaluated extensively in a spectrum of 
other retinal diseases, particularly retinal vasculopathies.12,13 These studies 
have contributed to the growing significance of peripheral findings to 
disease management. The ease and speed of optomap image capture 
makes it feasible to incorporate them into routine exams with the result 
that overall exam time is reduced and patient satisfaction increased. 
Beyond rapid image capture, UWF retinal imaging provides additional 
efficiency advantages for the cataract practice. The OptosAdvance™ 
image management software permits cross-registration of multimodal 
images, the manipulation and annotation of images, and the importation 
of Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) compatible 
images from other diagnostic equipment, all of which can be viewed on

The Role of Ultra-widefield Retinal Imaging as a Standard Assessment Tool in the Cataract Practice
any networked computer screen or tablet. Image storage and sharing 
between offices or practices is managed through a cloud-based archive, 
minimizing storage challenges for the individual office. Remote offices 
are able to review the optomap files over the internet, without the 
requirement of Optos hardware or software. OptosAdvance also provides 
a 3D projection of the globe and major anatomical structures, which 
is very useful in educating patients about the health of their eyes and 
discussing IOL options.
The utility of ultra-widefield retinal imaging in the 
cataract assessment and follow-up
Pre-existing retinal pathology
Although there are few outright contraindications for cataract surgery, other 
than a low endothelial cell count, the detection and/or careful evaluation 
of pre-existing retinal pathology is critical to identify patients who may 
need treatment of retinal disease prior to cataract surgery or may require 
particular care during the procedure, both to prevent worsening of the 
underlying retinal condition and to optimize the outcomes of the cataract 
procedure. UWF is very useful in identifying and documenting pathologies 
such as lattice degeneration, macular holes or tears, and cobblestone 
degeneration, all of which carry a higher risk of retinal detachment.
Cataract evaluation often uncovers the first indications of retinal pathology 
in a patient, with preoperative referral providing confirmation of a diagnosis.
In this case (see Figure 2), for example, multimodal UWF imaging revealed
retinitis pigmentosa (RP) in a 62-year-old patient referred for blurry vision
and cataract. The patient was subsequently seen by a retina specialist
and cleared for cataract surgery. Because of the RP diagnosis, we chose
a monofocal implant. Following cataract extraction, the patient is 20/30
uncorrected OU and is very happy with his vision. The optomap images
were also useful in the process of educating the patient about RP
.
In most cases, pre-existing retinal disease, including age-related 
macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy, does not prevent 
the patient from undergoing cataract surgery. Large studies have 
shown that cataract surgery in these patients can provide sustained 
improvements in visual acuity.14,15 However, the impact of the procedure 
on the course of retinal disease remains controversial. Some evidence 
suggests increases in both the incidence and progression rate of 
diabetic retinopathy at 1 year after phacoemulsification cataract surgery, 
and findings are inconsistent from large studies about the association 
between cataract surgery and long-term risk for the development of 
either early or late AMD.16–18 It is clearer that the risk of post-surgical 
cystoid macular edema is increased in patients with a history of retinal 
vein occlusion or epiretinal membrane.19
Given the totality of the available evidence and our own experience, we 
are very conservative in the presence of retinal findings and maintain 
a low threshold for referral to a retinal specialist for further evaluation, 
including a dilated fundus exam and OCT, and potential treatment (see 
Figures 3 and 4). In these situations, the ability to rapidly and easily share 
an optomap image using the cloud facilitates inter-office communication 
and efficient patient management. In most of these cases, we are 
ultimately able to proceed with cataract surgery but may take additional 
measures in the postoperative phase to monitor the patient and 
aggressively control inflammation.
Lens choice considerations
Pathology in the macula evident on UWF is also important to the 
consideration of premium lens options, particularly multi-focal IOLs. 
Because of their design, these lenses can be associated with a decrease 
in contrast sensitivity and photic phenomena such as glare and halos—
effects that can be compounded by retinal disease.20,21 They may also 
result in impaired visualization of the retina in subsequent retinal surgery. 
 
If evidence of diabetic retinopathy, AMD, or epiretinal membranes is 
identified on UWF
, additional assessment, including macular function, 
should be conducted in consultation with the retina specialist to help 
determine the expected course of the disease and the long-term suitability 
of the lens choice. As lens technology continues to improve, providing 
greater degrees of spectacle independence with fewer trade-offs in vision 
quality, and data on long-term performance multi-focal IOLs in the presence 
of retinal disease is collected, these concerns may eventually be obviated. 
Postoperative follow-up
While large, prospective studies of the use of UWF in post-cataract 
monitoring have not yet been performed, Faberowski et al. have 
demonstrated that non-mydriatic color UWF imaging can be used

effectively to screen for retinal pathology in asymptomatic patients 
following cataract extraction.22 In their retrospective, observational case 
series in 76 eyes of 58 consecutive patients, UWF imaging provided good 
visualization of the peripheral retina in more than 90% of the patients 
and did not reveal any new retinal tears or detachments, including in 
patients with prior history of retinal pathology. Another group has 
demonstrated that non-mydriatic UWF imaging of patients after cataract 
surgery provides a rate of detection for retinal lesions comparable to 
mydriatic slit lamp and mydriatic Goldmann three-mirror contact lens 
examinations, while offering more convenience for the practice and 
comfort for the patient.23
We typically repeat optomap imaging at 2 weeks following surgery, even 
in asymptomatic patients. This gives us the ability to screen for any fundus 
changes while obtaining the first baseline UWF image of the retina with the 
cataractous lens removed.
Advantages of ultra-widefield retinal imaging in 
the cataract practice
In our experience, the benefits of integrating UWF retinal imaging 
 
into cataract assessment and follow-up can be grouped into five 
 
general areas:
Standardization
The use of the standardized UWF optomap image, within and between 
practices, helps reduce inter-observer variability and facilitates diagnostic 
and management consensus. The ability to overlay different imaging 
modalities or compare prior images is very useful in detecting and 
monitoring retinal pathology.
Streamlining retinal assessment
The ability to rapidly capture a high-resolution digital image in a patient-
friendly manner makes UWF retinal imaging an excellent evaluation tool, 
obviating the need, time, and cost of a dilated fundus exam unless findings 
are made. optomap images can be easily captured by a tech and are 
immediately available to the surgeon for evaluation.
Robust documentation
The standardized, digital optomap image is easily stored, annotated, and 
compared, providing a clinically useful component of the patient’s record. 
The use of UWF enhances documentation of retinal pathology, cataract 
opacity, implant choice, and postoperative results.
Mapping progression
Evaluation and post-op UWF images create an important baseline for 
ongoing monitoring of disease progression in patients with evident retinal 
pathology. The ability to compare a standardized image over time, annotate 
images, and toggle between imaging modalities provides additional 
assurance that pathological changes can be identified.
Economic advantages
The efficiency and ease of use of UWF imaging potentially allows the 
evaluation of a larger population of patients over a shorter period of time. 
For us, this has translated into improved patient flow and surgical volume. 
In addition, in some cases, documentation of peripheral pathology outside 
the reach of conventional cameras represents a reimbursable service that 
improves the economic equation for the practice. Offering UWF retinal 
imaging on a modest, fee-for-service basis may have similar benefits while 
ensuring that most patients enjoy the clinical benefits of a baseline optomap.
Conclusion
The increasing number of cataract patients—particularly those under 
65—and heightened patient expectations about postoperative visual 
outcomes are placing new demands on the cataract practice’s clinical 
rigor and resource allocation. The integration of Optos UWF retinal imaging 
into our preoperative assessment and postoperative follow-up protocols 
is helping to address these issues by offering an efficient, economical, and 
patient-friendly evaluation tool for retinal pathology, providing a consistent 
point of reference between clinicians, and helping to document retinal 
changes over time to help protect the patient’s long-term quality of vision. 
Additional experience by cataract surgeons and evidence from formal 
studies will help further define the potential contribution of UWF retinal 
imaging to enhancing immediate and long-term surgical outcomes.
