BACKGROUND: Animal and plant protein intakes have indicated 
opposite associations with cardiovascular mortality risk. Whether dietary 
proteins are associated with risk of heart failure (HF) is unclear. Thus, we 
examined the associations of proteins from different food sources with 
risk of HF.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The study included 2441 men aged 42 to 
60 years at the baseline examinations in 1984 to 1989 in the Kuopio 
Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study. Protein intakes at baseline 
were assessed with 4-day dietary records. Data on incident HF cases were 
obtained from national registers. HF risk according to protein intake was 
estimated by Cox proportional hazard ratios. During the mean follow-
up of 22.2 years, 334 incident HF cases occurred. Higher intake of total 
protein indicated a trend toward increased risk of HF (multivariable-
adjusted hazard ratio in the highest versus lowest quartile=1.33; 95% 
confidence interval: 0.95–1.85; P-trend=0.05). The associations between 
specific types and sources of protein with incident HF were consistent 
with this overall finding although not all associations reached statistical 
significance. For example, the hazard ratio in the highest versus lowest 
quartile was 1.43 (95% confidence interval: 1.00–2.03; P-trend=0.07) 
for total animal protein and 1.17 (95% confidence interval: 0.72–1.91; 
P-trend=0.35) for total plant protein.
CONCLUSIONS: In middle-aged men, higher protein intake was 
marginally associated with increased risk of HF.

espite the achieved improvements in heart fail-
ure (HF) management, the disease dramatically 
shortens life expectancy,1 highlighting the need 
for efficient prevention. Investigations on dietary ap-
proaches concentrating on HF prevention are scarce. 
Prospective studies have suggested that greater intake 
of fish or marine omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids2,3 
and whole grain products4,5 may associate with lower 
HF risk. In contrast, greater intake of total2 or red meat6 
and especially processed red meat7,8 or frequent intake 
of eggs9 may associate with increased HF risk. Results 
from previous studies are, nevertheless, inconclusive, 
and it is unclear which factors explain the differential 
relations of the protein sources with HF risk.
One factor contributing to cardiac function and 
onset of HF may be dietary protein. Substituting either 
plant or animal protein for carbohydrates has lowered 
blood pressure in experimental studies.10,11 Because 
high blood pressure is a major risk factor for HF,1 pro-
tein intake could also play a beneficial role in the patho-
genesis of HF. Benefits are suggested also by other 
studies: sufficient protein intake (>0.7 g/kg ideal body 
weight) was associated with lower cardiovascular and 
all-cause mortality in hypertensive patients,12 and ami-
no acid supplementation prevented cardiac dysfunction 
in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.13,14
Instead of considering only the total protein intake, 
prospective studies have indicated that proteins from 
different dietary sources may be differentially related 
to health. For example, higher intake of animal pro-
tein has been associated with increased cardiovascu-
lar mortality in some observational studies15,16 while 
plant protein intake has had an inverse association.15,17 
Whether different proteins with specific amino acid 
compositions have distinct roles also in relation to HF 
risk remains to be established.
To elucidate the role of dietary proteins in risk of 
HF, we examined whether total, animal, or plant pro-
tein intakes are related to HF risk in a population of 
middle-aged and older Finnish men. We also compared 
the associations of proteins from more specific animal 
and plant sources. In the secondary analyses, we inves-
tigated the associations of intakes of the main dietary 
protein sources with HF risk.
METHODS
The data, analytic methods, and study materials will not be 
made available to other researchers for purposes of reproduc-
ing the results or replicating the procedure.
Study Population
The KIHD (Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study) 
was designed to investigate risk factors for cardiovascular dis-
ease (CVD), atherosclerosis, and related outcomes in a popu-
lation based, randomly selected sample of men from eastern 
Finland.18 The baseline examinations were performed in 1984 
to 1989. A total of 2682 men who were 42, 48, 54, or 60 
years old at baseline (83% of those eligible) were recruited in 
2 cohorts (Figure I in the Data Supplement). Re-examinations 
were conducted 4, 11, and 20 years after the baseline. The 
baseline characteristics of the entire study population have 
been described previously.18 The Research Ethics Committee 
of the University of Kuopio has approved the KIHD study, and 
dietary compound of KIHD has been registered at Clinicaltrials.
gov. All subjects gave written informed consent. Subjects with 
diagnosed HF at baseline (n=194), unknown HF status (n=7), 
and those with missing data on dietary intakes (n=40) were 
excluded, leaving 2441 men for analyses.
Baseline Measurements
Fasting venous blood samples were collected between 8 am 
and 10 am. Subjects were instructed to abstain from ingest-
ing alcohol for 3 days and from smoking and eating for 12 
hours before providing the sample. Detailed descriptions 
of the determination of serum lipids,19 lipoproteins,19 and 
magnesium20 and the assessment of medical history and 
medications,19 family history of diseases,19 smoking,19 alco-
hol consumption,19 physical activity,21 and blood pressure19 
have been published. Education years, annual income, mari-
tal status, and dietary supplement use were obtained from 
self-administered questionnaires. Family history of coronary 
heart disease (CHD) was defined as positive if a first-degree 
relative of the participant had a CHD history. Body mass index 
(BMI) was computed as the ratio of weight in kilograms to 
the square of height in meters. Serum creatinine was mea-
sured with the clinical chemistry analyzer Kone Specific (KONE 
Instruments Oy, Espoo, Finland) using Jaffe reaction, and esti-
mated glomerular filtration rate was calculated by the Chronic 
Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formula.22
Dietary Assessment
Baseline food consumption was assessed with a food record 
of 4 days, one of which was a weekend day, by using 
WHAT IS NEW?
• Despite the increasing popularity of high-protein 
diets, the role of dietary protein in relation to heart 
failure risk has not been previously evaluated.
• We observed that high total protein intake was 
marginally associated with increased risk of heart 
failure.
• The associations with proteins from different 
sources were in accordance with the overall find-
ing, although not all associations reached statisti-
cal significance.
WHAT ARE THE CLINICAL  
IMPLICATIONS?
• This study suggests that high protein intake may 
not be the optimal dietary strategy in the preven-
tion of heart failure.

household measures. A picture book of common foods and 
dishes was used to help in the estimation of portion sizes. 
To further improve accuracy, instructions were given, and 
completed records were checked by a nutritionist together 
with the participant. Nutrient intakes were estimated with 
NUTRICA 2.5 software (Social Insurance Institution, Turku, 
Finland). The software’s databank is mainly based on Finnish 
nutrient composition values of foods.
We calculated protein coming from different sources 
(Table I in the Data Supplement). Total meat included red 
meat, white meat, and offal. Processed red meat included 
industrially processed red meat. For the analyses with major 
plant protein sources, we combined the most protein-rich 
plant foods, that is, grain products, legumes, nuts, and seeds. 
Dietary calcium included calcium from food sources but not 
from supplements. Each nutrient was energy adjusted by the 
residual method.23
Ascertainment of HF Cases and Other 
Diseases
Incident HF cases between study entry and December 31, 
2014, were obtained by computer linkage to the National 
Hospital Discharge Register (maintained by the National 
Institute for Health and Welfare in Finland). The International 
Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision codes I11.0 and 
I50.0-I50.9 were used for diagnostic classification of HF cases. 
There were no losses to follow-up.
Data on other incident diseases or medications during the 
follow-up were obtained by record linkage to the National 
Hospital Discharge Register and to the Social Insurance 
Institution of Finland register for reimbursement of medicine 
expenses or by diagnosis at the re-examination rounds.
Statistical Analysis
The univariate relations of total, animal, and plant protein 
intakes with baseline characteristics were assessed by means 
and linear regression (continuous, normally distributed vari-
ables), by medians and Jonckheere–Terpstra test (continu-
ous, skewed variables), or by χ2 tests (categorical variables). 
Correlations between intakes of different proteins were esti-
mated by Spearman correlation coefficients.
Person-years of follow-up were calculated from the base-
line to the date of HF diagnosis, death, or the end of follow-
up, whichever came first. Cox proportional hazards regression 
models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) in expo-
sure quartiles, with the lowest category as the reference. 
Schoenfeld residuals did not indicate significant evidence of 
violation of the proportional hazards assumption. Absolute 
risk (AR) change was calculated by multiplying the AR in the 
reference group by the multivariable-adjusted HR change in 
the comparison group.
Covariate selection was based on literature of identified 
and potential risk factors for HF or on associations with expo-
sures and outcomes in the present analysis. Model 1 included 
age, examination year, and energy intake. The multivariable 
model (model 2) included the variables in model 1 plus edu-
cation years, income, pack-years of smoking, alcohol intake, 
leisure-time physical activity, BMI, family history of CHD, 
baseline disease status (CHD or use of cardiac medications, 
diabetes mellitus or hypertension), and intakes of saturated, 
monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and trans fatty acids and 
fiber. In addition, the disease status was updated throughout 
the follow-up, and the diseases and medications mentioned 
above were included as time-dependent covariates. Model 2 
was also mutually adjusted for other proteins. Models that 
include protein and fat but not carbohydrates can be inter-
preted as replacement of carbohydrates with the protein in 
interest. All quantitative variables were entered in the models 
as continuous variables. The cohort mean was used to replace 
missing values in covariates (<2.4%). Tests of linear trend 
were conducted by assigning the median values for each 
category of exposure variable and treating those as a single 
continuous variable. Marital status, use of dietary supple-
ments, serum total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cho-
lesterol ratio, serum triglycerides, serum magnesium, baseline 
estimated glomerular filtration rate, history of atrial fibrilla-
tion, cardiomyopathy, stroke, valvular defect, myocarditis or 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or intake of fruits and 
vegetables were not included in the models because they did 
not appreciably affect the associations (change in estimates 
<5%). Potential nonlinear associations were assessed semi-
parametrically using restricted cubic splines with 3 knots. To 
assess replacement of proteins with each other, all proteins 
were simultaneously added into the models, and the differ-
ence of regression coefficients of 2 proteins of interest, their 
variance, and covariance were used for calculating HRs and 
95% confidence intervals (CIs).
In the secondary analyses, we investigated the associa-
tions of the protein sources with risk of HF. Identical list of 
covariates were used as in the main analysis. However, the 
possible effect mediators, that is, intakes of saturated, mono-
unsaturated, polyunsaturated, and trans fatty acids and fiber, 
were not added to model 2, but instead an additional model 
3 with these factors was created.
The statistical significance of the interactions with baseline 
disease status (CHD or use of cardiac medications, diabetes 
mellitus, or hypertension), CHD status, BMI (below versus 
above median), and smoking status was assessed by likeli-
hood ratio tests with the use of a cross-product term. All P 
values were 2-tailed (α=0.05). Data were analyzed with SPSS 
21.0 for Windows (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY) and Stata 13.1 
(Stata Corp, College Station, TX; for spline analysis).
RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics
The mean protein intake was 93.2 g/d (15.8% of total 
energy intake), of which 70.0% was from animal sourc-
es and 27.7% from plant sources (Table II in the Data 
Supplement). Of the total protein intake, 2.3% was 
from mixed sources and was not included into either 
animal or plant protein. Dairy (28.8 g/d), meat (24.7 
g/d), and fish (8.1 g/d) were the major animal protein 
sources whereas most of the plant protein came from 
grain products (20.5 g/d) and potatoes (2.4 g/d).
Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the study 
population. Men with greater total protein intake were 
younger, more likely to be married, had longer educa-
tion, and higher income than those with lower protein

intake. On the contrary, they had higher BMI and were 
more likely to have diabetes mellitus. They had higher 
intake of fiber, polyunsaturated fatty acids, fruits, berries 
and vegetables, and processed red meat. High animal 
protein intake was also associated with more favorable 
socioeconomic factors, but with higher BMI, higher 
probability of being smoker and having diabetes mel-
litus. Those with higher animal protein intake had lower 
intake of fiber but higher intake of polyunsaturated fat-
ty acids. High plant protein intake was generally associ-
ated with healthier lifestyle and dietary factors (Table 1).
Associations of Dietary Proteins With 
Risk of HF
During the mean follow-up of 22.2 years, 334 cases of 
HF were recorded. Total protein intake was not associ-
ated with risk of HF in the age, examination year, and 
energy intake adjusted model (model 1; Table 2). After 
multivariable adjustments, those in the highest versus 
the lowest quartile of total protein had a borderline 
significant 33% (95% CI: −5% to 85%; P-trend=0.05) 
increased risk of HF. There was no evidence for nonlin-
earity in the association (Figure). Those in the highest 
versus the lowest quartile of total animal protein had 
43% increased risk (95% CI: 0%–103%; P-trend=0.07); 
AR=12.3% in the lowest quartile, with a 5.3% increase 
in the highest quartile to AR=17.6%; model 2 in Table 2.
Those in the highest versus lowest quartile of dairy 
protein intake had multivariable-adjusted 49% (6%–
109%; P-trend=0.03) higher risk of HF (model 2 in 
Table 2; AR=12.0% in the lowest quartile, AR=17.9% in 
the highest quartile). However, there was evidence for 
nonlinearity (P-nonlinearity=0.03; Figure II in the Data 
Supplement). The association was stronger for protein 
from fermented dairy, with 70% (95% CI: 21%–140%; 
P-trend <0.001; P-nonlinearity=0.09) higher risk in the 
highest quartile as protein from nonfermented dairy 
indicated nonsignificant association (Table 2). Because 
of these findings, we explored the baseline character-
istics according to the fermented dairy protein intake 
but found that higher intake of fermented dairy pro-
tein was generally associated with healthier lifestyle 
and dietary factors (Table III in the Data Supplement). 
In more detailed analyses, protein from other ferment-
ed dairy products (98.4% contained ≤2.5% fat) had a

stronger association with HF than protein from cheese 
(Table 2). Proteins from total meat and from meat sub-
types, milk, and plant sources had nonsignificant asso-
ciations toward increased HF risk (Table 2), without evi-
dence for nonlinear associations (P-nonlinearity >0.10). 
Proteins from fish and eggs were not associated with 
HF risk.
In the substitution models, replacing protein from 
one source with protein from another source did not 
reveal any statistically significant associations (P>0.05).
Associations of Dietary Protein Sources 
With Risk of HF
Intake of total dairy had a trend toward increased risk 
of HF in multivariable-adjusted model 2, with a 36% 
(95% CI: −5% to 94%; P-trend=0.07) higher risk in the 
highest versus the lowest quartile. Adjusting for nutri-
ent intakes strengthened the association (model 3; Table 
IV in the Data Supplement). Those in the highest intake 
quartile of fermented dairy products had multivariable-
adjusted 62% (95% CI: 20%–119%; P-trend=0.001) 
higher risk of HF when compared with the lowest quar-
tile (model 2; Table IV in the Data Supplement). Fur-
ther adjustment for nutrients had little impact on the 
associations (model 3). Nonfermented dairy intake had 
no association with HF risk (Table IV in the Data Sup-
plement). Intakes of total meat or any meat subtype, 
fish, eggs, or main vegetable protein sources did not 
have statistically significant associations with HF risk in 
the multivariable-adjusted models (Table IV in the Data 
Supplement).
Association of Calcium Intake With Risk 
of HF
Because of the findings with dairy, in the post hoc anal-
yses, we investigated the associations of dietary calcium 
with HF risk. After multivariable adjustments, those in 
the highest calcium intake quartile had 39% (95% CI: 
1%–91%; P-trend=0.07) higher risk of HF when com-
pared with the lowest quartile (model 2; Table V in the 
Data Supplement). The increased risk was only present 
in the highest calcium intake quartile (>1528 mg/d).
We also tested whether adjustment for calcium 
intake attenuates the associations observed with fer-
mented dairy protein. Adjusting model 2 further for 
calcium intake, the HRs (95% CIs) in the highest quar-
tile for proteins from fermented dairy and fermented 
dairy excluding cheese were 1.86 (1.00, 3.55) and 1.46 
(0.87, 2.47), respectively.
Sensitivity Analyses
Dairy, fermented dairy, or any dairy proteins did not 
indicate statistically significant interactions by baseline 
disease history (CHD or use of cardiac medications, dia-
betes mellitus or hypertension; P-interactions >0.32), 
CHD history (P-interactions >0.32), BMI (P-interactions 
>0.47), or smoking status (P-interactions >0.62). How-
ever, in the stratified analyses based on disease his-
tory, higher intake of the major plant protein sources 
was associated with increased risk of HF among those 
without disease history (n=832; 64 cases; HR per 100 
g intake, 1.46; 95% CI: 1.00–2.12; model 2) but not 
among those with disease history (n=1609; 270 cas-
es; HR=0.91; 95% CI: 0.76–1.10; P-interaction=0.04). 
We did not find evidence for interaction with intake of 
plant protein (P-interaction=0.13). For other proteins or 
protein sources, interactions by disease history (P-inter-
actions >0.07), CHD history (P-interactions >0.08), BMI 
(P-interactions >0.06), or smoking status (P-interactions 
>0.15) were not statistically significant.
Because HF is typically an end-stage heart disease, 
some of the CVD subjects may die before developing 
HF. Thus, we considered the competing risk of CVD 
mortality by using a composite outcome of HF or CVD 
mortality (n=1640; cases=379 after excluding the par-
ticipants with CVD at baseline). In these analyses, most 
associations were attenuated (eg, HR=1.04; 95% CI: 
1.00–1.08 per 5 g higher total protein intake) whereas 
the association for nonfermented dairy was strength-
ened (Table VI in the Data Supplement).
Because the long follow-up may attenuate asso-
ciations with the exposures that were assessed only 
at baseline, we tested the associations with 10 years 
Figure. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios of total protein intake with 
risk of heart failure in 2441 men, evaluated by restricted cubic splines 
from Cox proportional hazards models.  
The model was adjusted for age (y), examination year, energy intake (kcal/d), 
education (y), income (euros/y), pack-years of smoking (packs smoked per 
day×years smoked), alcohol intake (g/wk), leisure-time physical activity (kcal/d), 
body mass index (kg/m2), family history of coronary heart disease (yes/no),

shorter follow-up (n=96 cases). The associations were 
generally similar although not all of them reached sta-
tistical significance. For example, HRs (95% CIs) per 5 
g intake of total, animal, dairy, and fermented dairy 
protein were 1.06 (0.98–1.15), 1.06 (0.97, 1.14), 1.10 
(0.99, 1.22), and 1.13 (1.01, 1.27), respectively (model 
2; other data not shown). The association of cheese 
intake with risk of HF was stronger with the shorter fol-
low-up (model 2 HR=1.58; 95% CI: 1.03–2.41 per 50 g 
intake of cheese), and the association remained statisti-
cally significant after adjustment for nutrient intakes. 
We also tested the exclusion of HF cases that occurred 
during the first 2 years of follow-up (n=3) but this did 
not change the results.
DISCUSSION
In this population-based cohort study in middle-aged 
and older men from eastern Finland, high protein 
intake was marginally associated with increased risk 
of HF. Most proteins from different animal and plant 
sources were associated with a higher risk although 
not all associations were statistically significant. Similar 
findings were observed with the protein sources.
Previously, 
high-protein–low-carbohydrate 
diets 
have been related to increased risk of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus and all-cause mortality,17 and high animal pro-
tein intake with increased cardiovascular mortality,15,16 
but studies have not examined protein intake in rela-
tion to HF risk. Nevertheless, trials in humans have sug-
gested that supplementation with a mixture of amino 
acids may prevent cardiac dysfunction in patients with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus.13,14 Of various amino acids, 
branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) that are abundant 
in dairy but also in other animal protein sources24 are 
of special interest as BCAA catabolism is impaired in a 
failing heart.25,26 The unanswered question is whether 
the dietary intake of BCAAs affects the development 
of HF.26 Human trials are lacking, and BCAA supple-
mentation in animals has had both beneficial27,28 and 
harmful effects on cardiac function.29 Thus, the poten-
tial effects of proteins and amino acids on HF risk need 
further clarification.
In our analyses, total dairy and fermented dairy 
were associated with increased HF risk. As we observed 
comparable associations for dairy and dairy proteins, it 
is hard to disentangle whether the results are because 
of the protein per se or because of some other fac-
tors in dairy. In one previous study, intake of high-fat 
dairy was related to increased HF risk.5 However, total2 
or fermented dairy30,31 intake has not been related to 
HF risk in other studies. Furthermore, studies have 
reported beneficial or neutral associations of dairy and 
fermented dairy intakes with risk of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus and CVD.32–34 Also we have observed in this 
same cohort that high intake of fermented dairy was 
associated with decreased risk of fatal and nonfa-
tal CHD.35 Dairy protein and major dairy amino acids 
have also induced beneficial metabolic effects in trials, 
such as lowered blood pressure and improved glyce-
mic control.11,36–38 Interestingly, though a meta-anal-
ysis observed an increased risk of all-cause mortality 
with high dairy intakes (>750 mL/d),39 indicating that 
high intakes may not be favorable. Accordingly, we 
observed higher HF risk mainly among those with the 
highest intake of total (>927 g/d) and fermented dairy 
(>281 g/d). It is worth noticing that the median intakes 
of total dairy (682 g/d) and fermented dairy (103 g/d) 
in our study are higher than in many other cohorts, 
where the corresponding intakes have been 111 to 
400 g/d and 40 to 100 g/d, respectively.34
What could explain the stronger association of fer-
mented compared with nonfermented dairy with HF 
risk in our study? A major source of fermented dairy 
was sour milk whereas nonfermented dairy was pre-
dominantly milk. These products have fairly similar 
nutrient content (eg, BCAAs, other amino acids, cal-
cium), indicating that these nutrients unlikely account 
for the stronger association of fermented dairy. More-
over, as adjustment for different dietary fatty acids 
strengthened the direct association between fermented 
dairy and risk of HF, the fat quality is not a probable 
explanation, either, especially because the association 
was stronger with protein coming predominantly from 
reduced or low-fat fermented dairy products. Sour milk 
also includes probiotics, but probiotics may—based on 
animal studies—actually have beneficial effects on car-
diac function,40 thus providing no clarification for our 
observation. Finally, as higher fermented dairy protein 
intake was associated with a healthier lifestyle, other 
lifestyle factors unlikely explain its association with 
higher HF risk. To sum up, we did not find a plausi-
ble explanation for why fermented dairy or its protein 
would be more detrimental than nonfermented dairy. 
Thus, considering that we included many analyses in 
the present study, we cannot exclude the possibility of 
a chance finding explaining the result.
In the post hoc analyses, a high intake of dietary 
calcium (>1528 mg/d) was related to increased HF risk. 
In contrast, calcium supplementation (1000 mg/d) with 
vitamin D (400 µg/d) did not affect HF risk in the over-
all cohort of postmenopausal women but was ben-
eficial for those with low HF risk.41 However, a meta-
analysis observed a U-shaped association between 
total calcium intake and cardiovascular mortality: the 
risk gradually increased at intakes >800 mg/d.42 Stud-
ies, however, suggest that it is mainly the excessive 
intake of supplemental calcium that associates with 
increased cardiovascular risk whereas dietary calcium 
is generally considered safe.43–45 The more pronounced 
increase in serum calcium after calcium supplementa-
tion is hypothesized to promote aortic calcification and

blood coagulation.44 Because we did not have data 
about calcium supplement use in our cohort, we were 
not able to compare dietary and supplemental calcium. 
However, higher dietary calcium intake compared with 
most studies42 may possibly explain its association with 
increased HF risk.
In agreement with one previous meta-analysis,46 
we did not observe protein from fish or fish intake 
to associate with HF risk. In contrast, another meta-
analysis found that intake of fish and marine ome-
ga-3 fatty acids is related to decreased HF risk.3 
Preparation methods could explain the discrepancy 
in results; baked or broiled fish has been associated 
with decreased HF risk whereas fried fish has had an 
association with increased risk.47,48 Intakes of meat 
protein, total meat, or any meat subtype were not 
associated with HF risk, either. This result complies 
with one previous study, in which intake of red meat 
was not associated with HF risk.5 Yet, many studies 
have found a higher HF risk with greater intakes of 
total meat,2 red meat,6 and especially of processed 
red meat.7,8 Because consumption of total and pro-
cessed meat in our study is comparable or higher than 
in other cohorts,2,8 the meat consumption patterns 
unlikely explain the difference between the studies. 
Differences in preparation methods of meat and dif-
ficulties in categorizing meat as unprocessed or pro-
cessed49 may, however, affect the results. There is no 
apparent explanation for why a high consumption of 
major plant sources was associated with a higher HF 
risk among those without disease history. Because of 
low number of events in this group, the association 
might be a chance finding.
Our finding that egg protein or egg intake had no 
association with HF risk contradicts with a meta-anal-
ysis that revealed a direct association between high 
egg intake and HF risk.9 Egg contains high quality 
protein and several bioactive compounds but is also 
a major source of dietary cholesterol and hence still 
has a controversial role on heart health and mortal-
ity.39,50 Lifestyle factors related to egg intake may also 
affect its associations with health.50 More research on 
effects of egg intake in diverse populations is thus 
needed.50
The strengths of our study are the prospective pop-
ulation-based setting, no losses during the follow-up, 
and extensive measurement of diet and possible con-
founding factors. Our study also has limitations. The 
single baseline measurement of diet and other lifestyle 
factors and the inability of a 4-day food recording to 
accurately assess typical intakes of occasionally con-
sumed and seasonally varying foods could introduce 
random error and thus attenuate associations. How-
ever, the associations were comparable with a shorter 
follow-up. Despite considering various covariates in our 
models, residual confounding cannot be completely 
excluded, and it may potentially explain the asso-
ciations between dairy and HF. We also did not have 
information on calcium supplement use. Some misclas-
sification in the outcome measure is possible although 
the use of national registers for ascertaining HF cases 
reduces false diagnoses compared with self-reporting. 
Finally, we were not able to separate the HF cases with 
preserved or reduced ejection fraction that have differ-
ential pathogenesis1 and cannot, therefore, conclude 
whether the associations of protein intake differ with 
different subtypes of HF.
CONCLUSIONS
Our results suggest that higher protein intake may be 
associated with a higher risk of HF in middle-aged and 
older men. Further studies in diverse study populations 
are needed to elucidate the role of protein intake in the 
pathogenesis of HF.
