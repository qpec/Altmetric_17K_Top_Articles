ABSTRACT
The origins of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) have been widely accepted to be the consequences of simian im-
munodeficiency viruses from wild chimpanzees (SIVcpz) crossing over to humans. However, there has not been any in vivo
study of SIVcpz infection of humans. Also, it remains largely unknown why only specific SIVcpz strains have achieved cross-
species transmission and what transmission risk might exist for those SIVcpz strains that have not been found to infect humans.
Closing this knowledge gap is essential for better understanding cross-species transmission and predicting the likelihood of addi-
tional cross-species transmissions of SIV into humans. Here we show that humanized bone marrow, thymus, and liver (hu-BLT) mice
are susceptible to all studied strains of SIVcpz, including the inferred ancestral viruses of pandemic and nonpandemic HIV-1 groups M
(SIVcpzMB897) and N (SIVcpzEK505) as well as strains that have not been found in humans (SIVcpzMT145 and SIVcpzBF1167). Im-
portantly, the ability of SIVcpz to cross the interspecies barrier to infect humanized mice correlates with their phylogenetic distance to
pandemic HIV-1. We also identified mutations of SIVcpzMB897 (Env G411R and G413R) and SIVcpzBF1167 (Env H280Q and Q380R)
at 14 weeks postinoculation. Together, our results have recapitulated the events of SIVcpz cross-species transmission to humans and
identified mutations that occurred during the first 16 weeks of infection, providing in vivo experimental evidence that the origins of
HIV-1 are the consequence of SIVcpz crossing over to humans. This study also revealed that SIVcpz viruses whose inferred descen-
dants have not been found in humans still have the potential to cause an HIV-1-like zoonosis.
IMPORTANCE
It is believed that the origins of HIV-1 are the consequence of SIV from wild chimpanzees crossing over to humans. However, the
origins of HIV-1 have been linked back to only specific SIVcpz strains. There have been no experiments that directly test the in
vivo cross-species transmissibility of SIVcpz strains to humans. This is the first in vivo study of SIVcpz cross-species transmis-
sion. With the humanized-BLT mouse model, we have provided in vivo experimental evidence of multiple SIVcpz strains cross-
ing over to humans and identified several important mutations of divergent SIVcpz strains after long-term replication in human
cells. We also found that the cross-species transmission barrier of SIVcpz to humans correlates with their phylogenetic distance
to pandemic HIV-1 group M. Importantly, this work provides evidence that SIVcpz viruses, whose inferred descendants have not
been found in humans, still have the potential to cause a future HIV-1-like zoonotic outbreak.
H
uman immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infections
have claimed millions of human lives since the pandemic
began in 1981, and HIV-1 still infects about 2.3 million people
every year (1, 2). Based on comparative phylogenetic analyses of
HIV-1 and simian immunodeficiency viruses from chimpanzee
(SIVcpz), it has been shown that AIDS is a zoonotic disease caused
by cross-species transmissions of SIVcpz to humans (3, 4). HIV-1
is classified into M, N, O, and P groups, and each group is thought
to have originated from an independent cross-species transmis-
sion. The HIV group M is the causative agent of pandemic HIV/
AIDS; in contrast, group N, O, and P viruses infect only a limited
number of individuals (5, 6). There are four subspecies of chim-
panzees with distinct geographical distributions in Africa: Pan
troglodytes subsp. verus in West Africa; P. troglodytes subsp. velle-
rosus in Nigeria and northern Cameroon; P. troglodytes subsp.
troglodytes in southern Cameroon, Gabon, and the Republic of
Congo; and P. troglodytes subsp. schweinfurthii in the Democratic
Republic of Congo and countries to the East (7). The P. troglodytes
subsp. troglodytes and P. troglodytes subsp. schweinfurthii chim-
panzees harbor SIVcpzPtt and SIVcpzPts, respectively. It has been
shown that specific lineages of SIVcpz from the wild chimpanzee
P. troglodytes subsp. troglodytes in Africa have founded pandemic
HIV-1 group M and nonpandemic group N infections; in contrast,
SIVcpz in the wild chimpanzee P. troglodytes subsp. schweinfurthii
or other strains from the P. troglodytes troglodytes group have not
been found in humans (4–13). However, the reason for this differ-
ence is unknown and cannot be explained simply by geographical
isolation, because SIVcpzMT145 also belongs to the P. troglodytes
troglodytes group, but no human infection has been found.
It is impossible to conduct SIVcpz infection experiments in
humans. Moreover, due to the lack of an in vivo experimental
model, until now there has been no investigation of the initial
interaction between SIVcpz and humans. Thus, some outstanding

 questions remain. Can different SIVcpz strains readily infect hu-
mans? Why have only specific SIVcpz strains spilled over to hu-
mans? For those SIVcpz strains that have not been found in
humans, do they still have the potential to cause an HIV-like
zoonosis? How does SIVcpz adapt in the new human host? How-
ever, to date, there is no way to directly study the in vivo transmis-
sion of divergent strains of SIVcpz to humans.
The combination of human CD34� pluripotent hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation with surgical engraftment of human fetal
liver and thymic tissues results in improved immune cell recon-
stitution, maturation, and selection in humanized bone marrow,
thymus, and liver (hu-BLT) mice. This hu-BLT mouse model is
the best available animal model for humans (14, 15). Hence, hu-
BLT mice provide an ideal in vivo model to test the infectivity of
different strains of SIVcpz in humans and recapitulate the critical
events of SIVcpz cross-species transmission to humans. In addi-
tion to the inferred ancestral viruses of HIV-1, chimpanzees or
other nonhuman primates (NHPs) in Africa harbor other viruses
that potentially can cause another pandemic zoonotic disease like
HIV-1 in the future. Furthermore, there are more than 30 African
NHP species that are infected with more than 40 different strains
of simian immunodeficiency viruses (16). The conceptual frame-
work and experimental system developed in this study can also be
used to evaluate the potential risk of other emerging pathogens
from nonhuman species, especially the great apes, to infect hu-
mans by cross-species transmission.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Virus stock preparation. To generate virus, infectious molecular
clones of SIVcpz (SIVcpzMB897, SIVcpzMB897-M30R, SIVcpzEK505,
SIVcpzEK505-M30R, SIVcpzMT145, and SIVcpzBF1167) and HIV-
1SUMA were transfected into 293T cells. Briefly, 60 �g of plasmid DNA
diluted into 120 �l Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) was used to
transfect 293T cells. After 48 h of transfection, culture supernatant was
collected and filtered through a 0.45-�m filter from each flask. A 35-ml
volume of filtered medium was loaded into each Ultra-Clear tube (Beck-
man Coulter) for ultracentrifugation. Virus ultracentrifugation was con-
ducted with an Optima L-100X ultracentrifuge and an SW 32 Ti rotor
(Beckman Coulter) at 25,000 rpm for 90 min at 4°C. Supernatant was
discarded, and the pellet was resuspended into 1 ml fresh medium, ali-
quoted into 200 �l in each sterile screw-cap vial, and stored at �150°C.
Virus stocks were titrated on the TZM-bl reporter cell line with an X-Gal
(5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-�-D-galactopyranoside)
staining
kit
(Genlantis). Titers are expressed as TZM-bl infectious units (IU) per ml.
Generation of hu-BLT mice. Hu-BLT mouse generation and assess-
ment of human immune cell reconstitution were conducted as we previ-
ously reported (17, 18) at the University of Nebraska—Lincoln Life Sci-
ences Annex in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Research
Committee-approved protocols. Briefly, 6- to 8-week-old female NSG
mice (NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ, catalog number 005557;
Jackson Laboratory) were housed and maintained in individual microiso-
lator cages in a rack system capable of managing air exchange with prefil-
ters and HEPA filters (0.22 �m). Room temperature, humidity, and pres-
sure were controlled, and air was also filtered. On the day of surgery, mice
received whole-body irradiation at the dose of 12 cGy/gram of body
weight with the RS200 X-ray irradiator (RAD Source Technologies, Inc.,
GA) and were then implanted with one piece of thymic tissue fragment
sandwiched with two pieces of human fetal liver tissue fragments under
the murine left renal capsule. Within 6 h of surgery, mice were injected via
the tail vein with 1.5 � 105 to 5 � 105 CD34� hematopoietic stem cells
isolated from human fetal liver tissues. Human fetal liver and thymus
tissues were procured from Advanced Bioscience Resources (Alameda,
CA). After 9 to 12 weeks, human immune cell reconstitution in peripheral
blood was measured by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) Aria II
flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) using antibodies against
mCD45-APC, hCD45-FITC, hCD3-PE, hCD19-PE/Cy5, hCD4-Alexa
700, and hCD8-APC-Cy7 (catalog numbers 103111, 304006, 300408,
302209, 300526, and 301016, respectively; BioLegend, San Diego, CA).
Raw data were analyzed with FlowJo (version 10.0; FlowJo LLC, Ashland,
OR). All mice used in this study had high human immune reconstitutions
with a ratio of hCD45� cells to a combination of hC45� cells and
mCD45� cells in peripheral blood higher than 50%. The mice were ran-
domly assigned into experimental groups with similar immune reconsti-
tution levels (Table 1).
High-dose SIVcpz infections of hu-BLT mice. To test human suscep-
tibility to SIVcpz, 25 female hu-BLT mice with high immune reconstitu-
tion were randomly divided into 5 groups (Table 1), and each mouse was
inoculated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with a high dose (3 � 104 � 0.2 � 104
IU) of SIVcpzMB897, SIVcpzEK505, SIVcpzMT145, SIVcpzBF1167, or
HIV-1SUMA, respectively. Peripheral blood was collected weekly in the
first 4 weeks postinoculation (wpi) and once every 2 weeks thereafter. At
16 wpi, mice were euthanized and the tissues of spleen, lymph node,
kidney lymphoid organoid, and jejunum were collected and fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde (PFA) and SafeFix II (Fisher Scientific) for in situ tissue
analyses. A few hu-BLT mice developed graft-versus-host disease before
16 weeks and were sacrificed for humane reasons. Fresh tissue was imme-
diately frozen into liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction.
Cross-species transmission barrier of SIVcpz. To quantify the cross-
species transmission barrier of SIVcpz to infect humans, each of the
SIVcpz strains and HIV-1SUMA was titrated based on viral reverse trans-
criptase (RT) activity, which is the best available method (19). The RT was
measured in triplicate using the EnzChek reverse transcriptase assay kit
(Invitrogen, Eugene, OR, USA). The virus strains were lysed using 10%
Triton X-100 (final concentration, 1%) in RPMI medium supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase
(CHIMERx, Milwaukee, WI, USA) was used for the standard curve. Hu-
BLT mice with good immune reconstitution were divided into 5 groups
(n � 6 for SIVcpzMB897, and n � 5 for other strains), from which each
mouse was inoculated i.p. with a low dose (0.52 U/mouse) of SIVcpz or
HIV-1SUMA, respectively (Table 1). At 2 and 4 wpi, pVL was measured to
determine infection status. If pVL was negative at 4 wpi, the animal was
considered uninfected and would receive another round of virus inocula-
tion and pVL measurement at 2 and 4 wpi, until all the animals were
infected. To determine the interspecies barrier, the Kaplan-Meier plot for
conversion to infected status for each SIVcpz group was compared to that
of HIV-1SUMA, and Kaplan-Meier plots for conversion to infected status
between different SIVcpz strain groups were also compared.
Competition of wild-type SIVcpz versus the Gag M30R mutant. To
compare the in vivo fitness of wild-type SIVcpz and its Gag M30R mutant
counterpart, hu-BLT mice (n � 6/group) were inoculated with a 1:1 mix
of wild-type SIVcpzMB897 or SIVcpzEK505 with its Gag M30R mutant
counterpart, respectively. We used inoculum containing both equal copy
numbers of wild-type and mutant mix (n � 3) or equal infectious units of
wild-type and mutant mix (n � 3), since the latter would eliminate the
possibility that an equal-copy-number inoculum may contain an unequal
number of infectious viruses. The doses of equal-copy-number mix for
each wild-type and mutant were 1.53 � 109 for SIVcpzMB897 and 4.1 �
108 for SIVcpzEK505 copies/mouse, respectively; and the doses of equal
infectious unit mix for SIVcpzMB897and SIVcpzEK505 were 1.5 � 104
and 1.4 � 104 IU/mouse, respectively (Table 1). At 4 wpi, the mice were
euthanized and full-length gag sequences from plasma were amplified and
sequenced using Sanger’s method.
pVL. Plasma viral RNA (vRNA) was extracted using a QIAamp Viral
RNA minikit (Qiagen). Plasma viral load (pVL) was conducted using
reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) on a C1000 Thermal
Cycler and the CFX96 Real-Time system (Bio-Rad) and the TaqMan Fast
Virus 1-Step master mix (Life Technologies). SIVcpz strain-specific prim-
ers and probes (Table 2) were designed, and no crossover signal was found

 among different strains. The detection limit of pVL was 200 copies/ml,
which was determined through repeating endpoint detection of serial
dilution of the AcroMetrix HIV-1 Panel (Life Technologies).
ISH and IHC staining. Viral RNAs in tissues were detected using in
situ hybridization (ISH) by following our previously reported protocol
(20). To generate sense and antisense SIVcpz strain-specific probes, the
full-length gag and env genes of SIVcpz were amplified using RT-PCR
with strain-specific primers (Table 2). The amplicons were cloned into the
pCR4 Blunt-TOPO vector (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Insert orientation
was determined by sequencing with T3 and T7 primers at Sequetech
(Mountain View, CA), and plasmid DNA was linearized with restriction
enzyme NotI or Pme I (New England BioLabs), from which 35S-labeled
antisense and sense probes were synthesized in vitro. Sense probe was used
as negative control. After 14 days of exposure, in the developed radioau-
tographs viewed with transmitted light, the vRNA� cells appear as black
dots; viewed with epipolarized light, the vRNA� cells appear as blueish or
greenish dots because of the large numbers of silver grains overlying the
cell. To define the SIVcpz-infected cell type, the combined ISH and im-
munohistochemical (IHC) staining was conducted as previously reported
(20). Overnight exposure was used. Anti-CD4 rabbit monoclonal anti-
body (EPR6855, 1:100 dilution; Abcam) and a cocktail of mouse mono-
clonal anti-CD68 (KP1, 1:100 dilution; Leica), anti-Ham56 (HAM56,
1:100 dilution; Dako), and anti-CD163 (10D6, 1:100; Leica) antibodies
were used to identify CD4� T cells and macrophages, respectively. We
manually counted about 200 viral RNA� cells to determine the percentage
of colocalization of viral RNA with CD4� T cells or macrophages.
Sequencing of viral genes. To assess the in vivo adaptions of SIVcpz,
vRNA was extracted from plasma with the RNeasy Plus minikit (Qiagen)
from SIVcpzMB897- and SIVcpzBF1167-infected hu-BLT mice at 14 wpi
(n � 2 and 3, respectively). The cDNA was synthesized using a strain-
specific primer (Table 2) and Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Life
Technologies). The cDNAs were amplified using Q5 Hot Start High-Fi-
delity DNA Polymerase (New England BioLabs) with strain- and gene-
specific primers (Table 2). The amplicons were confirmed by 1.0% aga-
rose gel stained with ethidium bromide, and bands were cut and purified
by using the GeneJET gel extraction kit (Thermo Scientific). The ampli-
cons of full-length gag, pol, and env regions for each sample were directly
sequenced using Sanger’s method at Sequetech (Mountain View, CA) or
by next-generation sequencing (NGS; Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx) at
the University of Nebraska Genomics Core (Lincoln, NE). PCR amplicons
of some genes were also cloned into the pCR4 Blunt-TOPO vector
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) for cloning sequencing at Sequetech (Moun-
tain View, CA). Sequencing primers were designed based on primer walk-
ing. The sequences were manually examined peak by peak and assembled
individually using Sequencher 5.0 (Gene Codes CorP., Ann Arbor, MI)
after the ends of sequences containing ambiguous nucleotides were
trimmed. The sequences were confirmed by overlapping identical regions.
All the data obtained by bulk, cloning, and next-generation sequencing
were analyzed and compared.
Bioinformatics analysis. The phylogenetic tree showing the evolu-
tionary relationship between strains of SIVcpz and HIV-1 in Fig. 1 was
made from pol sequences of SIVcpz, SIVgor, and HIV-1 groups M, N, O,

 and P. The coordinates of pol gene are 3887 to 4778 on the HIV-1/HXB2
genome. The pol sequences were aligned using MUSCLE 3.8 to generate
multiple-sequence alignment in the PHYLIP interleaved format (21). The
alignment used maximum iteration to get the highest accuracy. Phyloge-
netic analysis was performed using PHYML 3.0 (22), an implementation
of the maximum likelihood method. The tree was visualized by FigTree
1.4.2 (23). The sequences of env, gag, and pol genes from hu-BLT-mouse
samples were processed using an in-house-developed pipeline to identify
the mutation sites that had a �5% mutation rate in order to reduce back-
ground noise. To exclude random mutations, we used the following cri-
teria to identify significant mutations. The nucleotide changes are non-
synonymous, which resulted in the same amino acid change in all
sequenced animals of each group. Meanwhile, the average nucleotide sub-
stitution must be above 20%. The identified nucleotide changes were con-
verted into amino acid mutations. The corresponding positions for these
mutations were mapped to and annotated on HIV-1 GP160 trimer using
UCSC Chimera 1.10.2 (23). The file for PDB 3J5M for the trimer structure
was downloaded from the RCSB Protein Data Bank. The sequence logos
for these identified Env AA mutations were generated from 55 HIV-1 M
group and 23 available SIVcpz sequences using WebLogo 2.8.2 (http:
//weblogo.berkeley.edu) (24).
Statistics. The log rank and Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon tests (25) were
used to determine the statistical significance of the Kaplan-Meier plots for
conversion to infected status between SIVcpz and HIV-1SUMA groups and
between different SIVcpz groups. Two-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was used to test the statistical difference of pVL of SIVcpz and
HIV-1SUMA at different time points postinoculation. Both tests were per-
formed by using Graphpad Prism software (Graphpad; San Diego, CA,
USA). P values of �0.05 were considered significant.

 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Four SIVcpz strains infect hu-BLT mice. We first tested whether
divergent strains of SIVcpz can infect hu-BLT mice. We selected 4
phylogenetically divergent SIVcpz strains to represent the inferred
ancestral viruses of pandemic HIV-1 group M (SIVcpzMB897)
and nonpandemic HIV-1 group N (SIVcpzEK505) (6, 26), as well
as SIVcpzMT145 (6) and SIVcpzBF1167 (27), whose viral lineages
have not been found in humans (4, 8). We included HIV-1SUMA, a

 clade B founder virus derived from an individual acutely infected
with HIV-1 (28), representing the pandemic HIV-1 group M
(HIV-1/M). Hu-BLT mice with high human immune reconstitu-
tion were randomly divided into 5 groups (n � 5/group) (Table
1), from which each hu-BLT mouse was inoculated intraperitone-
ally (i.p.) with the dosage of 3 � 104 � 0.2 � 104 infectious units/
mouse (IU). It has been reported that the simian-to-human cross-
species transmissions of SIVcpz in Africa occurred mainly
through human contact with infected chimpanzee blood through
events such as hunting, bush meat preparation, and bites from
infected apes (4, 8, 9); thus, we did not inoculate virus through a
mucosal route. Peripheral blood was collected weekly in the first 4
weeks postinoculation (wpi) and once every 2 weeks thereafter for
a total of 16 weeks. Plasma viral loads (pVL) were quantified using
qRT-PCR with strain-specific primers and probes (Table 2). As
expected, pVL in HIV-1SUMA-infected mice reached a plateau
(�106 copies/ml) from 2 to 16 wpi (Fig. 2E). Strikingly, all four
SIVcpz strains can infect and replicate in hu-BLT mice with kinet-
ics similar to that of HIV-1, regardless of whether they come from
P. troglodytes subsp. troglodytes or P. troglodytes subsp. schwein-
furthii, including SIVcpzBF1167 and SIVcpzMT145, whose viral
lineages have not been found in humans (Fig. 2A to D). Of note,
the timing of reaching the pVL plateau for SIVcpzBF1167 was
delayed compared to HIV-1SUMA (P � 0.01 at 2 wpi; P � 0.001 at
3, 4, 6 wpi) (Fig. 2F).
Lymph node tissues were collected after euthanasia at 16 wpi.
Using in situ hybridization (ISH) with 35S-labeled strain specific
antisense probes, we detected viral RNA� cells in these tissues
from all hu-BLT mice that were infected with each different SIVcpz
strain (Fig. 3A; one SIVcpzEK505-infected animal is shown as a

 representative) compared with the negative control using sense
probes (Fig. 3B). We found that humanized mice are susceptible
to all 4 divergent strains of SIVcpz infection in vivo, suggesting
that SIVcpz strains that have not been found in humans have the
ability to infect human cells, which may generate an HIV-1-like
zoonosis. SIVcpz-infected cell types in vivo were determined by
using a combination of ISH and immunohistochemical (IHC)
staining, and we demonstrated that the majority of detectable
SIVcpz infection occurs in CD4� T cells for all studied SIVcpz
strains (88.64% � 1.89%) (Table 3; Fig. 3C and D, blue arrows;
an SIVcpzBF1167-infected animal is used as a representative), and
some of the detectable SIVcpz infection occurs in macrophages
(12.88% � 1.91%) (Table 3; Fig. 3E and F). The infected cell types
are similar among 4 strains of SIVcpz-infected hu-BLT mice,
which is consistent with HIV-1 infection in humans (20).
Cross-species transmissibility of 4 divergent strains of
SIVcpz viruses to humans. Because SIVcpzMT145 (P. troglodytes
subsp. troglodytes) and SIVcpzBF1167 (P. troglodytes subsp.
schweinfurthii) inferred descendant viruses have not been found
in humans, our hypothesis is that different SIVcpz strains have
diverse cross-species transmissibility to infect humans. We first
sought to normalize the inoculum of the 4 SIVcpz strains and
HIV-1SUMA. Since a dose based on infectious units or 50% tissue
culture infective dose (TCID50) may be biased due to the human-
origin indicator cells, we used reverse transcriptase activity to nor-
malize the dose of inoculum (19). We then reduced the inocula-
tion dose to 0.52 RT units, which is significantly lower (9.42-fold
reduction of IU on average) than the high-dose inoculum that we
used in initial infections of hu-BLT mice. We inoculated hu-BLT
mice with a repeated, low dose of SIVcpz through the i.p. route.
hu-BLT mice were divided into 5 groups (n � 5 or 6 for each
group) (Table 1), from which each mouse was inoculated with
each respective virus strain. Plasma VL was measured at 2 and 4
wpi to determine the infection status. If pVL was negative at 4 wpi,
the animal was considered uninfected and reinoculated, which
was followed by pVL measurement until all animals were demon-
strably infected. The Kaplan-Meier plots for conversion to in-
fected status for each SIVcpz group were compared to that of
the HIV-1SUMA group to quantify the barrier of cross-species
transmission for each strain. There are significant differences
in the number of inoculations needed for infection between
SIVcpzMT145 (Fig. 4C) and SIVcpzBF1167 (Fig. 4D) compared
with HIV-1SUMA (P � 0.0495 and P � 0.0027, respectively). Al-
though differences are not significant, SIVcpzMB897 (Fig. 4A)
and SIVcpzEK505 (Fig. 4B) required a higher number of inocula-
tions than HIV-1SUMA to infect all of the hu-BLT mice (P � 0.3613
and P � 0.3173, respectively). We then tested the differences be-
tween SIVcpz strains in the number of inoculations needed for
infection. There are significant differences between SIVcpzMB897
and SIVcpzBF1167 (P � 0.0076) as well as between SIVcpzEK505
and SIVcpzBF1167 (P � 0.0131); however, there are no significant

0.9818) or between SIVcpzMT145 and SIVcpzBF1167 (P �
0.7317). Thus, the cross-species transmission barriers of different
SIVcpz strains are correlated with their phylogenetic distance to
HIV-1/M (Fig. 1). Our study revealed that the different cross-
species transmission barriers of SIVcpz play an important role in
determining the establishment and spatial dissemination of pan-
demic HIV-1. It is also plausible that the different cross-species
transmission barriers of SIVcpz may have also impacted the effi-
ciency of initial human-to-human transmission.
Mutations of SIVcpz in vivo. It has been proposed that viral
adaptation was required to overcome host-specific innate restric-
tion factors found between chimpanzees and humans (29–32). To
assess the in vivo mutations of SIVcpz, we sequenced the major
viral genes (gag, pol, and env) of SIVcpzMB897 and SIVcpzBF1167
in hu-BLT mice at 14 wpi. The following criteria were used to
identify each significant mutation: nucleotide changes had to
be nonsynonymous, resulting in the same amino acid change
for all sequenced animals, and the average nucleotide substitu-
tion rate from all sequenced animals had to be �20%. We did
not find any cross-animal mutation in gag or pol that accumu-
lated more than 10% on average at 14 wpi compared with the
inoculum. However, as shown in Fig. 5A, next-generation se-
quencing (NGS) of SIVcpzMB897env gene revealed a consis-
tent G-to-A change at positions 1231 (24.45% on average) and
1237 (53.53% on average) in two sequenced animals compared
with sequences in the inoculum. The detected nucleotide
changes correspond to G411R and G413R, respectively. As
shown in Fig. 5B, NGS of SIVcpzBF1167 env gene revealed a
consistent T-to-A/G change (A/G is synonymous) at position
840 (41.20% on average) and an A-to-G change at position
1129 (58.23% on average) in all three sequenced animals. The
detected nucleotide changes correspond to H280Q and Q380R,
respectively. We also checked whether the observed SIVcpz
mutations exist in HIV-1 Env, as shown in the mutation se-
quence logos (Fig. 6), and we found that all the mutated amino
acids exist in HIV-1 but three of them are absent in SIVcpz
(SIVcpz BF1167 H280Q and Q380R and MB897 G413R). For
the SIVcpz BF1167 H280Q mutation, Q is absent in SIVcpz but
present in HIV-1 with low frequency. Similarly, for the muta-
tion Q380R, R is absent in SIVcpz but present in HIV-1 with
low frequency. For the MB897 G411R mutation, R is present in

 both SIVcpz and HIV-1; for the MB897 G413R mutation, R is
absent in SIVcpz but present in HIV-1.
Since SIVcpz Env three-dimensional (3D) structures are not
available, the locations of these mutations were mapped to the
corresponding position on the HIV-1 gp160 trimer (Fig. 5C).
The G411R, G413R, H280Q, and Q380R mutations were located
at the interface between gp41 and gp120, adjacent to or within the
CD4 binding loop, respectively (Fig. 5C). The CD4 binding loop
of HIV-1 gp120 is essential for interacting with the primary CD4
receptor during viral entry and a site of vulnerability for broadly
neutralizing antibodies to target (33, 34).
Previously, it was reported that all known strains of SIVcpz
at position Gag 30 encode a Met (M) or Leu, but many current
pandemic HIV-1 strains encode Arg (R) or Lys at that position
(35, 36). Moreover, SIVcpz Gag M30R has a fitness advantage
over its wild-type counterpart as observed in a replication com-
petition assay using human cells and tonsillar explant cultures
(35, 36). Thus, we compared the fitness of Gag M30R mutants

 of SIVcpzMB897 and SIVcpzEK505 to the fitness of their wild-
type counterparts in an in vivo competition study. To eliminate
the possibility that an equal copy number may have unequal in-
fectious units, an equal-infectious-units (IU) mixture competi-
tion was also conducted; this was not done in previously reported
explant tonsil culture studies. Four groups of hu-BLT mice (n �
3/group) were used (Table 1), and each mouse was inoculated
with an equal-copy-number or equal-IU mix of wild-type and
mutant virus. At 4 wpi, the SIVcpzMB897 M30R mutant virus was
dominant in 5 (3 in the equal-copy-number group and 2 in the
equal-IU group) of 6 animals (Fig. 7A and B). Interestingly, one
animal showed the opposite selection (wild-type dominant) after
4 weeks of competition (Fig. 7B). The SIVcpzEK505 M30R mu-
tant was dominant in all 6 mice (Fig. 7C and D). From these in vivo
competition assays, we conclude that the GagM30R mutation
confers a fitness advantage over its wild-type counterpart in most
cases. However, we did not detect this Gag M30R mutation after
14 weeks of infection in the hu-BLT mice; one plausible explana-
tion is that this de novo adaptation may need more time.
A previous report showed that the vpu is also important in the
evolution of SIVcpz to HIV-1 to antagonize tetherin function
(31). Thus, we also sequenced the full-length vpu gene of 4 SIVcpz
strain-infected hu-BLT mice (n � 3/group) at 14 wpi using bulk
sequencing. The vpu sequences of all 12 samples at 14 wpi are
identical to the inoculum sequences, which may indicate that the
de novo generation of this adaptation of vpu may also need addi-
tional time or the selective pressure that would have led to those
substitutions may not be present in hu-BLT mice.
In short, using the hu-BLT mouse model, our results for
the first time clearly demonstrate that hu-BLT mice are suscep-
tible to all studied SIVcpz strains in vivo, including the inferred
ancestral viruses of pandemic and nonpandemic HIV-1 groups
M (SIVcpzMB897) and N (SIVcpzEK505), as well as the strains that
havenotbeenfoundinhumans(SIVcpzMT145andSIVcpzBF1167).
Importantly, the transmissibility of different SIVcpz strains cross-
ing the interspecies barrier to infect humanized mice is inversely
correlated with their phylogenetic distance to pandemic HIV-1.
We also identified in vivo mutations of SIVcpzMB897 (Env G411R
and G413R) and SIVcpzBF1167 (Env H280Q and Q380R) at 14
weeks postinoculation. Together, our results recapitulated the
events of SIVcpz cross-species transmission to humans and iden-
tified in vivo mutations that occurred in the first 16 weeks of in-
fection, providing in vivo experimental evidence that the origins of
HIV-1 are the consequence of SIVcpz crossing over to humans.
This study also revealed that SIVcpz viruses whose lineages have
not been found in humans, although they have lower cross-species
transmissibility, still have the potential to cause an HIV-1-like
zoonosis. Since wild NHPs, especially our closest relatives, the
great apes, still harbor many SIV strains, these reservoirs may con-
tinue to pose a risk for potential zoonotic outbreak in humans.
