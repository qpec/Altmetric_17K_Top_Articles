Abstract
Aims/hypothesis Low birthweight has been associated with
a high risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in observational
studies. However, it remains unclear whether this relation
is causal.
Methods The present study included 3627 individuals with
type 2 diabetes and 12,974 control participants of European
ancestry from the Nurses’ Health Study and the Health
Professionals Follow-Up Study. A genetic risk score (GRS)
was calculated based on five low-birthweight-related single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We assessed the evidence
for causality first by examining the association of the GRS and
the individual SNPs with type 2 diabetes, and second by
performing a Mendelian randomisation analysis to estimate
the potentially causal effect size of low birthweight on type
2 diabetes.
Results In a meta-analysis of the two studies, each 1 point
increment in the GRS was associated with a 6% (95% CI
3%, 9%) higher risk of type 2 diabetes. CCNL1 rs900400
and 5q11.2 rs4432842 showed dose–response associations
with risk of type 2 diabetes; the corresponding ORs
and 95% CIs were 1.09 (1.03, 1.16) and 1.09 (1.02, 1.16),
respectively. Furthermore, we observed an overall
Mendelian randomisation OR of 2.94 (95% CI 1.70, 5.16;
p < 0.001) for type 2 diabetes per 1 SD lower genetically
determined birthweight.
Conclusions/interpretation A genetically lowered
birthweight was associated with increased susceptibility to
type 2 diabetes. Our findings support a potential causal
relation between birthweight and risk of type 2 diabetes,
providing new evidence to support the role of intrauterine
exposures in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.

 Introduction
Type 2 diabetes has become a major global public health
problem through an increasing burden of complicated
morbidity and mortality [1–3]. It has been hypothesised that
prenatal development might influence the susceptibility to
type 2 diabetes in later life [4, 5]. Low birthweight, a widely
used indicator of retarded fetal growth and intrauterine
malnutrition, has been consistently related to an increased risk
of type 2 diabetes in observational studies [6–9]. However, it
remains unclear whether intrauterine growth plays a causal
role in the development of type 2 diabetes, as it is difficult to
fully eliminate confounding by socioeconomic status and
lifestyle factors in observational studies.
Genetic association analysis is less likely to be affected by
confounding and has been increasingly employed to inform
causality [10]. A recent genome-wide association study
(GWAS) in up to 69,308 individuals of European ancestry
identified several genetic variants associated with birthweight
[11]. Birthweight is a widely used surrogate for restricted
intrauterine growth, which has been suggested to affect the
risk of type 2 diabetes in later life. The genetic variants
influencing birthweight may be intended to capture exposures
that restrict intrauterine growth. We hypothesised that the
exposures influencing intrauterine growth might lie in the
causal pathway for susceptibility to type 2 diabetes.
Although the intrauterine risks are unlikely to be measured,
the exposures that affect intrauterine growth can be reflected
in the birthweight. It is therefore possible to estimate the
potential causal relation between intrauterine risks and type
2 diabetes by using the genetic variants related to birthweight.
In the present study, we first examined the evidence for
causality by testing whether the genetic predisposition to
low birthweight, which was evaluated by the GWAS-
identified genetic variants, was associated with type 2
diabetes. We then performed a Mendelian randomisation
analysis to estimate the possible causal effect size of low
birthweight on type 2 diabetes.
Methods
Participants The Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) is a
prospective cohort study of 121,700 US female registered
nurses aged 30–55 years at the study inception in 1976 [12].
Between 1989 and 1990, 32,826 women provided blood
samples. The Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS)
is a prospective cohort study of 51,529 US male health
professionals aged 40–75 years at the study inception in
1986 [13]. Between 1993 and 1999, 18,159 men provided
blood samples. In both cohorts, information about medical
history and lifestyle has been collected biennially by self-
administered questionnaires since inception. Both studies
were approved by the human research committee at the
Brigham and Women’s Hospital (Boston, MA, USA), and
all participants provided written informed consent. For this
analysis, we used 1986 as the baseline date for the NHS and
HPFS. The present analysis included 5928 men and 10,673
women of European ancestry with genotype data available
based on previous GWASs [14–19].
Ascertainment of type 2 diabetes Diabetes was defined as
self-reported diabetes, with information collected by a
questionnaire and confirmed by a validated supplementary
questionnaire [20, 21]. For the diagnosis of diabetes before
1998, we used the National Diabetes Data Group criteria to
define diabetes [22], which included one of the following: one
or more classic symptoms (excessive thirst, polyuria, weight
loss, hunger, pruritus or coma) plus a fasting plasma glucose
level of ≥7.8 mmol/l, a random plasma glucose level of
≥11.1 mmol/l or an OGTT 2 h plasma glucose level of
≥11.1 mmol/l; at least two elevated plasma glucose levels on
different occasions in the absence of symptoms; or treatment
with hypoglycaemic medication (insulin or an oral
hypoglycaemic agent). For diagnosis of diabetes from 1998
onwards, we used the ADA diagnostic criteria [23]. These
criteria were the same as those proposed by the National
Diabetes Data Group, except for the elevated fasting plasma
glucose criterion, for which the cut-off point was changed
from 7.8 mmol/l to 7.0 mmol/l.
Participants with diagnosed type 2 diabetes from the cohort
baseline to follow-up until 2012 for the NHS and 2010 for the
HPFS were included as cases. The validity of self-reported
diabetes was verified in two subsamples from the NHS and
HPFS, respectively. A physician blinded to the information
reported on the supplementary questionnaire reviewed the
medical records according to the diagnostic criteria. The
medical record review’s confirmation rate of diabetes as
reported by the supplementary questionnaire was 98% for
the NHS and 97% for the HPFS [20, 21]. Control participants
were defined as those free of diabetes through the follow-up.
Assessment of covariates Participants in the NHS and HPFS
were requested to provide their birthweight on the 1992 and
1994 questionnaires, respectively, within categories (in kg) of
<2.26, 2.27–2.49, 2.50–3.15, 3.16–3.82, 3.83–4.4, ≥4.5 and
unknown in the NHS, and <2.50, 2.50–3.15, 3.16–3.82,
3.83–4.4, ≥4.5 and unknown in the HPFS. The validity of
the self-reported birthweight data has previously been
described [24, 25]. Self-reported birthweight was highly
correlated with recorded birthweight (r = 0.74) and the
birthweight reported by the participants’ mothers (r=0.71).
BMI was calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by
the square of height in metres. Information about smoking
status and alcohol intake was derived from the baseline
questionnaires [12, 13]. Physical activity was expressed as
Diabetologia (2016) 59:1920–1927
1921
 metabolic equivalents (METs) per week using the reported
time spent carrying out various activities, weighting each
activity by its intensity level. The validity of the self-
reported body weight and physical activity data has previously
been described [26, 27]. Self-reported and measured weights
were highly correlated at 0.97 for men and 0.97 for women
[26].
Genotyping and genetic risk score calculation Single nucle-
otide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping and imputation have pre-
viously been described in detail [15]. In brief, samples were
genotyped and analysed using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide
Human SNP Array 6.0 (Santa Clara, CA, USA) and the
Birdseed calling algorithm (www.broadinstitute.org/mpg/
birdsuite/birdseed.html). All samples used in the present study
achieved a call rate of >98%. We used MACH (www.sph.umich.
edu/csg/abecasis/mach) to impute SNPs on chromosomes 1–22,
with National Center for Biotechnology Information build 36 of
phase II HapMap Centre d’Etude du Polymorphisme (CEU:
Utah residents with northern and western European ancestry)
data (release 22; http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) as the
reference panel.
Seven SNPs have been identified as being associated with
birthweight by a previous GWAS [11]. We excluded two SNPs
lying in the ADCY5 and CDKAL1 loci that have been implicat-
ed by GWASs in susceptibility to type 2 diabetes [28, 29], and
calculated a genetic risk score (GRS) on the basis of the other
five SNPs to estimate the genetic variation of low birthweight.
The GRS was calculated using a weighted method according to
each SNP’s relative effect size (β coefficient), obtained from
the GWAS data [11]. The calculation equation was: weighted
GRS = (β1 × SNP1 + β2 × SNP2 + … + β5 × SNP5) × (5/sum
of the β coefficients), where SNPi is the number of risk
alleles associated with low birthweight, coding as 0, 1
and 2.
Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed in
SAS version 9.3 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
We assigned a median value to each category of
birthweight to model this variable as a continuous variable
in analyses. General linear models were applied to examine
the relationships of the GRS and individual SNPs to
birthweight and covariates. Quartiles of the GRS were
categorised according to quartile cut-off points for the control
participants. Comparisons of the proportions and mean values
across quartiles of the GRS were calculated by χ2 test and
ANOVA, respectively. We tested the associations of the
GRS and individual SNPs with type 2 diabetes by logistic
regression models. Results from the NHS and HPFS were
pooled using an inverse-variance-weighted, fixed-effect
meta-analysis (all p for heterogeneity >0.05). A restricted cu-
bic spline regression model, which can help to prevent prob-
lems resulting from inappropriate assumptions on
linearity, was used to test the linear relationship between the
GRS (as the continuous variable) and the risk of type 2
diabetes [30].
We further conducted Mendelian randomisation analysis
using the method previously described [10, 31, 32]. A
schematic presentation of the Mendelian randomisation
analysis is shown in Fig. 1. The β3 estimates for each SNP
to evaluate the association between low birthweight and risk
of type 2 diabetes can be calculated from the direct
measurements β1 (the estimate of effect size of each SNP on
birthweight) and β2 (the estimate of effect size of each SNP on
type 2 diabetes) as: β3=β2/β1. The SE of β3 is given by:
S3=

q
where S2 is the SE of β2. In this study, β1 is
the estimate of effect size of each SNP on birthweight
standardised using z score transformation derived from the
birthweight GWAS [11], and β2 is the loge OR estimate of
type 2 diabetes for each SNP calculated from the NHS and
HPFS using an inverse-variance-weighted, fixed-effects meta-
analysis (all p for heterogeneity >0.05). We first calculated β3
estimates for each SNP at CCNL1, LCORL, ADRB1 and
HMGA2 loci, and on chromosome 5q11.2, and then combined
β3 estimates for all five SNPs analysed using inverse-
variance-weighted, fixed-effects meta-analysis to obtain an
overall estimate of genetically determined low birthweight
associated with type 2 diabetes (all p for heterogeneity
>0.05). In a Mendelian randomisation design, the overall β3
estimate (loge OR) would be considered to be an estimate for
the causal association between low birthweight and type 2
diabetes. The OR for type 2 diabetes associated with each 1
SD lower genetically determined birthweight can be given by
exp(overall β3). We also performed a two-sample Mendelian
randomisation analysis using the latest genetic association
summary statistics for the trans-ethnic type 2 diabetes
GWAS meta-analysis [33].
Results
Characteristics of the participants at baseline The range of
the GRS was 0–10 for both women and men; the mean value
(SD) of the GRS was 4.45 (1.57) and 4.55 (1.57) among
women and men, respectively. As expected, GRS was
associated with birthweight in both women (β=−0.014 kg,
p=0.001) and men (β=−0.018 kg, p=0.001; see electronic
supplementary material [ESM] Fig. 1). The baseline
characteristics of 16,601 participants from the NHS and
HPFS according to quartiles of the low birthweight GRS are
presented in Table 1. Mean values for age, BMI, alcohol
intake, physical activity, total energy intake and proportions
of current smokers did not different across the quartiles of the
GRS for either men or women (all p >0.05). In addition,
the GRS was not associated with waist circumference,

(all p >0.05; ESM Table 1).
Low-birthweight GRS and type 2 diabetes The present
study included 3627 participants with and 12,974 partici-
pants without type 2 diabetes. The OR (95% CI) for type 2
diabetes per 1 SD lower birthweight was 1.35 (1.21, 1.50)
and 1.24 (1.06, 1.45) in the NHS and HPFS, respectively.
As shown in Table 2, the association between each 1 point
increment in the GRS and risk of type 2 diabetes was
stronger in women (OR 1.09; 95% CI 1.05, 1.13) than
men (OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.97, 1.07), with multivariable
adjustment for age, BMI, smoking status, alcohol intake,
physical activity, total energy intake and source of
genotyping data. In a meta-analysis of the results from
women and men, each 1 point increase in the GRS was

 associated with a 6% (95% CI 3%, 9%) increased risk of
type 2 diabetes; the OR (95% CI) for type 2 diabetes was
1.16 (1.01, 1.31), 1.18 (1.03, 1.33) and 1.24 (1.08, 1.39)
for the second, third and fourth quartiles of the GRS, re-
spectively, compared with the lowest quartile (p for trend
<0.001). Combining the data for both women and men, the
low-birthweight GRS showed a linear relation with an in-
creased risk of type 2 diabetes (p for linearity = 0.001;
Fig. 2).
Individual SNPs in relation to birthweight and type 2
diabetes Characteristics of individual SNPs and their relation
to birthweight and type 2 diabetes are depicted in Table 3.
The results of the NHS and HPFS were pooled using
inverse-variance-weighted, fixed-effects meta-analysis
(all p for heterogeneity >0.05). Of the five SNPs, CCNL1
rs900400 had the strongest association with a lower
birthweight (p < 0.001); CCNL1 rs900400 and 5q11.2
rs4432842 showed dose–response associations with risk
of type 2 diabetes, with OR (95% CI) values of 1.09
(1.03, 1.16) and 1.09 (1.02, 1.16), respectively.
Mendelian randomisation analysis We further performed
Mendelian randomisation analysis to estimate the causal effect
size of genetically determined low birthweight on type 2
diabetes (Fig. 3). β3 is the loge OR estimate of the association
between genetically determined low birthweight and type 2
diabetes for each SNP. Of the five SNPs, CCNL1 rs900400
and 5q11.2 rs4432842 showed statistically significant
associations with type 2 diabetes (β3 = 1.21 and 2.56,
respectively; both p <0.05). We then combined β3 estimates
for all five SNPs using inverse-variance-weighted, fixed-
effects meta-analysis to obtain an overall β3 estimate (p for
heterogeneity = 0.318). The overall β3 estimate was 1.08
(95% CI 0.53, 1.64). By exponentiating the overall β3, we
calculated an OR of 2.94 (95% CI 1.70, 5.16; p < 0.001),
indicating that each 1 SD lower genetically determined
birthweight was associated with a 1.94 (95% CI 0.70, 4.16)-
fold increased risk of type 2 diabetes.
We also derived data and performed a Mendelian
randomisation analysis using the latest genetic association
summary statistics for recent type 2 diabetes GWAS [33]. A

Discussion
We tested the potential causal effect of low birthweight on
type 2 diabetes in two large prospective cohorts of US men
and women. We found an association between the overall
genetic susceptibility to low birthweight, which was estimated
by a GRS, and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. We further
applied the Mendelian randomisation approach to provide
supportive evidence for the causality, and the findings were
confirmed using the summary statistics from the latest GWAS.
Evidence from both population and experimental studies
has suggested that restricted early life development has a
long-term structural and functional influence on individuals’
predisposition to an increased risk of metabolic diseases such
as type 2 diabetes. Famine studies from the Netherlands,
China and Ukraine have shown that individuals with retarded
intrauterine growth are more susceptible to type 2 diabetes
later in life [34–36]. As a widely used marker of fetal
malnutrition and growth retardation, low birthweight has been
consistently associated with a high risk of type 2 diabetes. A
meta-analysis of 14 studies showed a U-shaped relation
between birthweight and risk of type 2 diabetes [6]. A more
recent larger meta-analysis of 31 studies confirmed the
relation but suggested that the overall relation between

Pooled data based on the results of the two studies using inverse-variance-weighted, fixed-effects meta-analysis
(all p for heterogeneity >0.05)
a Allele coding was based on the forward strand. The effect allele is associated with low birthweight, and the other
allele is the reference allele
b The β coefficient represents the coefficients of birthweight (kg) associated with each increment in the low-
birthweight-related allele for genetic variants, adjusted for source of genotyping data
c OR represents the risk of type 2 diabetes associated with each increment in the low-birthweight-related allele for
genetic variants, adjusted for age and source of genotyping data

Fig. 3 Mendelian randomisation estimate of the association of low
birthweight with risk of type 2 diabetes. The forest plot shows β3
estimates (loge-ORs) of the effect of low birthweight on the risk of type
2 diabetes for each low-birthweight-related SNP. The overall β3 estimate
was obtained by using inverse-variance-weighted, fixed-effects meta-
analysis (p for heterogeneity = 0.318), and can be interpreted as an OR
of 2.94 (95% CI 1.70, 5.16) for type 2 diabetes per 1 SD lower genetically
determined birthweight (p < 0.001)

 birthweight and type 2 diabetes was likely to be linear, i.e. that
lower birthweight is related to an increased risk of type 2
diabetes [7]. In the present study, we also reported a linear
relation between the low-birthweight GRS and type 2
diabetes, which was in line with the previous observational
findings. Although the genetic association in men appeared to
be weaker than that in women, the sex difference was not
statistically significant (p>0.05).
According to Mendel’s second law, the alleles of one gene
sort into gametes independently of the alleles of another gene.
Therefore, genetic associations are less likely to be
affected by confounding and have been increasingly used in
causal inference [10, 31, 32]. Based on the positive findings
of genetic associations, we further used a Mendelian
randomisation approach, which can provide an unconfounded
estimate of a causal relationship between exposure and disease
outcome [37], to test the possible causality. Notably,
birthweight itself may not be an exposure relevant to type 2
diabetes; instead, the exposures influencing intrauterine
growth are more likely to play a causal role in the
development of the disease. As an indicator of intrauterine
growth, birthweight reflects the influence of intrauterine
exposures on fetal growth. Using the genetic variants related
to birthweight, our results lent support to a causal relation
between low birthweight and increased risk of type 2 diabetes.
Interestingly, the findings of the Mendelian randomisation
analysis suggested that the association between genetically
determined low birthweight and type 2 diabetes was mainly
driven by the SNPs at the CCNL1 locus and on chromosome
5q11.2, which have so far not been related to any known risk
factors for diabetes. Therefore, the findings are less likely to
be affected by the pleotropic effects of the genetic variants.
Moreover, we performed a two-sample Mendelian
randomisation analysis using the summary statistics for the
latest type 2 diabetes GWAS, and both the summarised genetic
association and Mendelian analysis results supported a
potential causal relation.
The major strengths of the present study include the
prospective design, the high-quality genetic data, the
utilisation of genetic and Mendelian randomisation
approaches and replication in well-powered summary
statistics GWAS data. To our knowledge, this study is the first
to investigate the potential causal relation between low
birthweight and risk of type 2 diabetes. We also acknowledge
several limitations. First, the study included only white
participants, and future investigations in other ethnic
populations are needed to verify our findings. Second,
although we excluded the likely pleiotropic variants at the
CDKAL1 and ADCY5 loci from the analysis, little is known
about the mechanisms underlying the other five loci. It is
possible that some or all of these loci could also influence
the processes leading to type 2 diabetes independently of
intrauterine growth. Third, we used individual SNPs rather
than a GRS as instrumental variables in the Mendelian
randomisation analysis, and the potential low power and weak
instrument bias could affect the results. Moreover, as the
Mendelian randomisation analysis was relatively small, future
studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to confirm the
findings.
In conclusion, we demonstrated that genetically lowered
birthweight was associated with an increased risk of type 2
diabetes. Our findings validate the epidemiological observation
of an inverse association between birthweight and type 2 diabe-
tes, and provides new evidence of a role for intrauterine expo-
sures in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.
