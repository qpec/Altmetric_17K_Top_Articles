Abstract
Envenomings by snakebites constitute a serious and challenging global health issue. The
mainstay in the therapy of snakebite envenomings is the parenteral administration of ani-
mal-derived antivenoms. Significantly, antivenoms are only partially effective in the control
of local tissue damage. A novel approach to mitigate the progression of local tissue damage
that could complement the antivenom therapy of envenomings is proposed. We describe an
abiotic hydrogel nanoparticle engineered to bind to and modulate the activity of a diverse
array of PLA2 and 3FTX isoforms found in Elapidae snake venoms. These two families of
protein toxins share features that are associated with their common (membrane) targets,
allowing for nanoparticle sequestration by a mechanism that differs from immunological
(epitope) selection. The nanoparticles are non-toxic in mice and inhibit dose-dependently
the dermonecrotic activity of Naja nigricollis venom.
Author summary
Snake envenoming affects approximately 2.5 million people and causes more than
100,000 deaths annually. The WHO includes envenoming as a category A Neglected
Tropical Disease. Therapy involves intravenous delivery of animal-derived antivenoms,
constituted by IgG from the plasma of mammals immunized with venom. Antivenoms
are species-specific, expensive and suffer the limitations of a biological therapy. There are
no broad-spectrum antivenoms. The work describes hope for treatment of snakebite, a
broad-spectrum antivenom comprised polymer nanoparticles (NPs) engineered to
sequester the major protein toxins in elapid snakes. The stable, low-cost NPs can be
administered subcutaneously immediately after the bite at the site of envenoming to halt
or reduce the extent of local tissue damage and mitigate the systemic distribution of toxins
post-envenoming.

 Introduction
Envenomings by snakebites constitute a serious and challenging global health issue, which
affects approximately 2.5 million people and causes more than 100,000 deaths annually. This
situation is particularly acute in impoverished rural settings of sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and
Latin America [1–4]. In addition, an estimated number of 400,000 people suffering snakebite
envenomings end up with permanent physical and psychological sequelae which greatly affect
their quality of life and generates a wave of social suffering in their families and communities
[4, 5]. Owing to its worldwide impact, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently
included snakebite envenoming as a category A disease in its list of Neglected Tropical Dis-
eases [4]. The mainstay in the therapy of snakebite envenomings is the parenteral administra-
tion of animal-derived antivenoms, constituted by IgG or IgG fragments purified from the
plasma of large animals immunized with venoms [6, 7]. When prepared by using appropriate
mixtures of venoms for immunization and following Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs),
antivenoms are safe and effective drugs which, if administered timely, can control the main
pathophysiological manifestations of envenomings, especially those associated with systemic
effects [6, 7].
However, there are several issues related to antivenom therapy that compromise their effec-
tiveness. These include, but are not limited to, the fact that antivenoms must be administered
in a timely manner in health facilities by trained health staff, thus limiting their use in rural set-
tings in countries where public health services and health personnel are scarce [8]. Effective
treatment is further complicated by the fact that antivenoms are specific for venoms used in
immunization and those of closely related snake species [7]. Significantly, antivenoms are only
partially effective in the control of local tissue damage characteristic of most viperid and some
elapid snakebite envenomings, mostly owing to the rapid development of these effects and the
often-delayed administration of antivenoms [9, 10]. These delays can lead to permanent tissue
damage and sequelae of various sorts [11–14]. There is a need therefore to develop novel thera-
peutic interventions, which could be administered in the field immediately following enven-
oming to arrest or mitigate the progression of local tissue damage and would hence
complement the antivenom therapy of envenomings. Solutions to this problem must grapple
with the biological complexity of snake venom as well as the social and economic challenges
associated with the production, distribution, storage and timely administration of the therapy.
An ideal fast response therapy should be administered safely and effectively in a rural setting
and be capable of inhibiting venom from diverse venomous species.
From a molecular standpoint, antivenom functions through a concerted neutralization pro-
cess involving the interaction between polyclonal antibodies and their toxin-targets. Owing to
the specificity of antibodies, the complexity of venoms requires an equally complex antibody
mixture capable of selectively interacting with and neutralizing relevant venom proteins. As a
consequence, toxins which are not recognized by antibodies are not neutralized. To maintain
bioactivity with increasingly diverse chemical composition, venomous animals have hijacked
along evolution privileged protein scaffolds with high densities of conserved disulfide cross-
links capable of withstanding diversification of amino-acid compositions on the surface [15].
A process of accelerated evolution of snake venom toxins has resulted in the generation of
great variation in surface residues which confer a wide spectrum of toxic activities within a
limited number of molecular scaffolds [16, 17]. This has an obvious impact in the ability of
antibodies to recognize variable epitopes in toxins. This balance between diversity and homol-
ogy is clearly manifest in snakes from the Elapidae family where most toxins consist of either
the phospholipase A2 (PLA2, ~14 kDa) or the three finger toxin (3FTX, ~8 kDa) scaffold [4].

 Both PLA2 and 3FTX protein families have many hundreds of isoforms capable of produc-
ing a range of pathophysiological effects [18]. However, amidst this immunological and func-
tional variability, many share similar functional features that are distinct from abundant
endogenous human proteins (Fig 1). Both toxin families have members that bind to cellular
membranes and either catalyze the hydrolysis of phospholipids and hence the degradation of
membrane bilayers (PLA2) or imbed themselves into membranes causing membrane disorga-
nization and cytotoxicity (cytotoxic 3FTXs) [19, 20]. Other 3FTXs bind with high affinity to
receptors in muscle cells or neurons, thus exerting a neurotoxic effect [21]. PLA2 isoforms,
which range from acidic to basic, generally maintain a conserved catalytic domain, which
entails a hydrophobic cavity capable of extruding glycerophospholipids from phospholipid
bilayers or lipoprotein particles [22, 23]. Similarly, 3FTXs are generally cationic at neutral pH,
however they have varying degrees of hydrophobicity in the loop regions that dictate the ulti-
mate target of the toxin [24, 25]. These exposed loop regions from both protein families con-
tain the greatest variability (Fig 1).
The chemical and structural diversity of PLA2 and 3FTX toxins are sufficient to challenge
development of a broad-spectrum antibody preparation. However, these two families of pro-
tein toxins share features that are associated with their common targets allowing for sequestra-
tion by a mechanism that differs from immunological selection. The NPs described in this
report “recognize” common structural features and broader physical properties of these toxins
and may mimic their biological target (cell membranes). This “lower resolution” affinity pro-
vides an opportunity for a wide coverage of recognition/neutralization, in contrast to antibod-
ies. Herein, we describe an abiotic hydrogel nanoparticle that indiscriminately associates with
and modulates the activity of a diverse array of PLA2 and 3FTX isoforms.

 Nanoparticle synthesis
N-phenylacrylamide (191.33 mg), N-isopropylacrylamide (191.33 mg), acrylic acid (44.57 mg)
N, N’-methylenebisacrylamide (75.15 mg) and sodium dodecylsulfate (30 mg, 1 μmol) were
dissolved in a 10% acetone solution in water (50 mL) to a final monomer concentration of 65
mM. The resulting solution was degassed with nitrogen for 30 min while stirring. Ammonium
persulfate (30 mg dissolved in 1 mL H2O) was added to the degassed solution, and the reaction
mixture was heated to 60˚C under nitrogen for 3 h. The polymerization was quenched by
exposing the reaction mixture to air, and the reaction mixture was transferred to a 12,000–
14,000 MWCO membrane and dialyzed against an excess of deionized water (changed twice a
day) for 4 d. 72% yield.
Nanoparticle characterization
Dynamic light scattering (DLS) was used to characterize the size and dispersity of the nanopar-
ticle after dialysis. Nanoparticle measurements were performed at 37˚C in PBS (Dulbecco’s)
and allowed to equilibrate at the designated temperature for 200 seconds prior to each mea-
surement and were measured at a scattering angle of 173˚. Concentration and yield was deter-
mined by lyophilizing a known volume of the purified nanoparticle suspension and weighing
the obtained dry polymer samples.

 TEM characterization
8 μL of nanoparticles (1 mg/mL) was injected on a glow discharged TEM grid (Ultrathin Car-
bon Type-A, 400 mesh) and let stand for 1 min. The solution was removed by filter paper and
the grid was left to air dry for 10 min. Next the grid was loaded into the instrument (FEI Tecnai
G2 TF20 high resolution TEM operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV) for imaging.
Venom selectivity in human serum
In a microcentrifuge tube, the nanoparticle (1 mg/mL final concentration) was incubated with
human serum (25% final concentration) in phosphate buffer saline (Dulbecco’s) for 5 min at
37˚C. Next, venom (250 μg/mL final concentration) was added to the nanoparticle/human
serum mixture and incubated for an additional 45 min at 37˚C. The suspension was then cen-
trifuged at 10,000 RPM for 10 min, and the supernatant was replaced with fresh phosphate
buffer saline four consecutive times or until the supernatant was depleted of protein by
SDS-PAGE (commassie blue stain). Next, 20 μL of SDS-PAGE sample preparation mixture
was added to the nanoparticle pellet, mixed and heated to 95˚C for 10 minutes. Finally, the
mixture was centrifuged at 5,000 RPM and the NP desorbed proteins were analyzed by
SDS-PAGE (100 V).
In gel digest
The designated slices were cut to 1mm by 1 mm by 1 mm cubes and destained 3 times by first
washing with 100 μL of 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate for 15 min, followed by addition of
the same volume of acetonitrile (ACN) for 15 min. The supernatant was collected and samples
were dried in a speedvac. Samples were then reduced by mixing with 200 μL of 100 mM
ammonium bicarbonate-10 mM DTT and incubated at 56˚C for 30 minutes. The liquid was
removed and 200 μL of 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate-55mM iodoacetamide was added to
gel pieces and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 20 min. After the removal of the
supernatant and one wash with 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate for 15 min, the same volume
of ACN was added to dehydrate the gel pieces. The solution was then removed and samples
were dried in a speedvac. For digestion, a sufficient solution of ice-cold trypsin (0.01 μg/μL) in
50 mM ammonium bicarbonate was added to cover the gel pieces which were set on ice for 30
min. After complete rehydration, the excess trypsin solution was removed, replaced with fresh
50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, and left overnight at 37˚C. The peptides were extracted twice
by the addition of 50 μL of 0.2% formic acid and 5% ACN followed by vortex mixing at room
temperature for 30 min. The supernatant was removed and saved. A total of 50 μL of 50%
ACN-0.2% formic acid was added to the sample, which was vortexed again at room tempera-
ture for 30 min. The supernatant was removed and combined with the supernatant from the
first extraction. The combined extracts were analyzed directly by liquid chromatography (LC)
in combination with tandem mass spectroscopy (MS/MS) using electrospray ionization.
LC-MS/MS analysis
LC-MS-MS: Trypsin-digested peptides were analyzed by ultra high pressure liquid chromatog-
raphy (UPLC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using nano-spray ioni-
zation. The nanospray ionization experiments were performed using a Orbitrap fusion Lumos
hybrid mass spectrometer (ABSCIEX) interfaced with nano-scale reversed-phase UPLC
(Thermo Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLC nano System) using a 25 cm, 75-micron ID glass capil-
lary packed with 1.7-μm C18 (130) BEHTM beads (Waters corporation). Peptides were eluted
from the C18 column into the mass spectrometer using a linear gradient (5–80%) of ACN

 (Acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 375 μL/min for 1h. The buffers used to create the ACN gradient
were: Buffer A (98% H2O, 2% ACN, 0.1% formic acid) and Buffer B (100% ACN, 0.1% formic
acid). Mass spectrometer parameters are as follows; an MS1 survey scan using the orbitrap
detector (mass range (m/z): 400–1500 (using quadrupole isolation), 120000 resolution setting,
spray voltage of 2200 V, Ion transfer tube temperature of 275˚C, AGC target of 400000, and
maximum injection time of 50 ms) was followed by data dependent scans (top speed for most
intense ions, with charge state set to only include +2–5 ions, and 5 second exclusion time,
while selecting ions with minimal intensities of 50000 in which the collision event was carried
out in the high energy collision cell (HCD Collision Energy of 30%), and the fragment masses
were analyzed in the ion trap mass analyzer (With ion trap scan rate of turbo, first mass m/z
was 100, AGC Target 5000 and maximum injection time of 35ms). Data analysis was carried
out using the Byonic (Protein Metrics Inc.). The excel files for each set of experiments are
included in the Supporting information (S1 File).
In vitro Naja nigricollis and Naja mossambica venom inhibition
The rat skeletal muscle myoblast cell line, L6, was offered by a collaborator, Luna. L6 cells were
grown in 150 cm2 flasks in culture DMEM media supplemented with 10%FBS and 1% penicil-
lin, incubated at 37˚C with 5% CO2. Cells were lifted using the trypsin and centrifuged at 800
rpm for 5 min to obtain the pellet. The cell pellet was suspended in culture DMEM media sup-
plemented with 2% FBS and 1% penicillin and seeded into 96 well-well cell culture plates
(about 1,500 cells /per well counted by cell counter). Plates were incubated at 37˚C with 5%
CO2. Media changed from the wells every second day until cell differentiation (appearance of
long striated cells, observed by eye using light microscope) was observed.
Cell proliferation assay
Concentration dependence of Naja nigricollis venom. Media were removed from the wells and
wells were washed once with pre-warmed PBS. Naja nigricollis venom stock solution was
diluted to 1 to 30 μg/mL in DMEM media and added into the wells. After 5min, 80 μg/mL
nanoparticle was added into the wells. Culture media controls (cell and media with no venom)
and the control without the addition of the nanoparticles were also run in parallel. The plate
was incubated at 37˚C with 5% CO2 for 14h. After 14h, the cell culture plate was removed
from the incubator and washed with pre-warmed PBS three times. Fresh DMEM media (50
mL) and MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide from Molecular
Probe, (10 mL, 12 mM solution in PBS) reagent were added and the wells mixed with a multi-
channel pipette. The mixtures were then incubated at 37˚C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator
for 3h and all the media was replaced with DMSO (100 μL). The solutions were incubated at
37˚C for 20 min, mixed and the absorbance was read at 570 nm by Microplate reader (Bio-
RAD).
Concentration dependence of the nanoparticles. The procedure was similar to that
described in the previous section. 7μg/mL venom was added into the wells and various con-
centrations of the nanoparticle from 1 to 150 μg/mL were added to the wells 5 min later. Cul-
ture media controls (cell and media with no venom) and the control without the addition of
the nanoparticles were also run in parallel. MTT assay was used to evaluate the cell viability at
570 nm.
Calculation of the nanoparticle efficacy. Half maximal effective concentration (EC50) refers
to the concentration of the nanoparticle which induces a response halfway between the

In vivo protocols
Venom. The venom of N. nigricollis was purchased from Latoxan and was obtained from adult
specimens of this species collected in Cameroon. Venom was stored at -20˚C and was dis-
solved just before each experiment.
Animal experiments. Mice of the CD-1 strain of 18–20 g body weight were used throughout
the study. All animals received food and water ad libitum and were submitted to a daily light:
dark cycle of 12 h each. The protocols used in animal experiments were approved by the Insti-
tutional Committee for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (CICUA) of the University of
Costa Rica (CICUA 82–8).
Assessment of toxicity of nanoparticles. A group of five mice received 100 μL of a nanopar-
ticle suspension (5.5 mg/mL) by the intravenous (i.v.) route in the caudal vein. A control
group of mice received 100 μL of 0.12 M NaCl, 0.04 M phosphate, pH 7.2 solution (PBS) under
otherwise identical conditions. Mice were closely observed for signs of acute toxicity and
changes in behavior during 4 h, and then left for 24 h to assess lethality. At this time, mice
were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation and tissue samples from heart, liver and kidney were col-
lected and immediately placed in fixative (3.8% formalin). After routine processing and
embedding in paraffin, 4 μm sections were obtained and stained with hematoxylin-eosin for
histological observation. Another group of mice received 100 μL of the nanoparticle suspen-
sion (5.5 mg/mL) intramuscularly in the right gastrocnemius muscle. Control mice received
the same volume of PBS. Three hours after injection, a blood sample was collected from the
tail, and the creatine kinase (CK) activity of plasma was quantified, by using a commercial kit
(CK LIQUI-UV, Stanbio Lab., Texas, USA), as an index of myonecrosis [26]. At 24 h after
injection mice were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation and a sample of the injected gastrocnemius
muscle was obtained and processed for histological evaluation as described above. Another
group of mice received 100 μL of a nanoparticle suspension (5.5 mg/mL) by the intradermal
route of injection in the ventral abdominal region. Seventy-two hour after injection, animals
were sacrificed as described, a sample of injected skin was obtained and placed in 3.8% forma-
lin solution, and processed for histological evaluation as described above.
Inhibition of dermonecrotic activity. Mixtures containing a fixed dose of venom and vari-
able amounts of NPs, both dissolved in PBS, were prepared as to have NP: venom ratios (w :
w) of 5, 2.5, 1.25 and 0.62. Controls included venom incubated with PBS only and NPs incu-
bated with PBS only. Mixtures were incubated at 37˚C for 30 min. Then, aliquots of 100 μL of
the mixtures, containing 100 μg venom, were injected intradermally, in the abdominal ventral
region, into groups of five mice. This venom dose was selected because it induces a necrotic
lesion in the skin of approximately 60 mm2 and had been previously used in the description of
the skin necrosis induced by this venom [10]. Seventy-two hours after injection, mice were sac-
rificed by CO2 inhalation, their skin was removed, and the area of necrosis in the inner side of
the skin was measured. Inhibition was expressed as the Median Inhibitory Ratio (IR50), corre-
sponding to the NP: venom ratio at which the area of the necrotic lesion was reduced by 50%

 as compared to controls injected with venom alone. Skin tissue samples were then placed in
fixative solution and processed for histological evaluation as described above.
In another set of experiments, groups of five mice received an intradermal injection of
100 μg venom, dissolved in 50 μL of PBS. Then, at various time intervals (0, 5, 15 and 30 min),
50 μL of NPs (5.5 mg/mL) were injected intradermally at the same site of venom injection. A
control group of mice received venom and then PBS instead of NPs. After 72 h the necrotic
area was assessed as described.
Statistical analysis
The significance of the differences between mean values of experimental groups was assessed
by Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey test for comparing pairs of means.
Ethics statement
The protocols used in animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Committee for
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (CICUA) of the University of Costa Rica (CICUA
82–8). This study meets the International Guiding Principles for Biomedical Research Involv-
ing Animals of the Council of International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS)
Results and discussion
Abiotic approach to antivenom
Several natural and synthetic molecules have been explored as possible candidates for venom
inhibitors [27–29]. Our approach differs from traditional strategies centered on immune-
based neutralization or inhibition by small molecule inhibitors of variable chemical nature.
We are developing abiotic synthetic polymer nanoparticle(s) (NPs) that have been engineered
to sequester and neutralize several of the major toxic components of snake venoms.
The “engineering” process that is used to identify the optimal chemical composition of a
NP for a target protein is called directed chemical evolution (DCE). This involves creating
small libraries of NPs with different chemical compositions and screening them against the
target protein. Lead candidates (those with some affinity for the protein target) are identified
and taken through another round of optimization. This process has been described in detail
[30].
The interactions between polymer nanoparticles (NPs) and proteins are as complex as pro-
tein-protein interactions. Binding involves combinations of weak interactions that include
electrostatic, hydrogen bonding, dipole-dipole and hydrophobic interactions. The relative
importance of each interaction depends upon the specific composition of NP and biomacro-
molecule partner. By systematically varying chemical composition of the nanoparticle we can
identify functional groups that contribute to binding. A quantitative analysis of the interaction
of a polysulfated carbohydrate (heparin) and NPs of different chemical composition using iso-
thermal titration calorimetry (ITC) established that binding arises from a combination of
weak interactions (hydrogen bonding, electrostatic and hydrophobic) and binding conditions
(temperature, pH, buffer and ionic strength) that contribute to binding [31]. A similar analysis
of the NPs and proteins in this study is scheduled for a future study.
Our first report described a synthetic polymer hydrogel NP that binds and inhibits the cata-
lytic activity of PLA2, one of the important families of protein toxins found in the venom of
many species of snakes [32].
When exposed to human serum alone, the NP associates with endogenous apolipoproteins,
primarily apolipoprotein A-1, but upon addition of venom, the bound apolipoproteins are

 exchanged for venom PLA2 proteins, suggesting that these materials could be used as a toxin
sequestrant in a complex biological setting. This NP was shown to be non-toxic in vitro, as
have similar NP hydrogels in vivo [33–35]. We now report an expanded study of the use of this
abiotic toxin sequestrant. We have found that a single polymer NP is effective in capturing the
two most important families of protein toxins common in Elapidae snakes: PLA2 and 3FTX.
In addition, the NP has also demonstrated in vitro and in vivo inhibition of toxic activities of
Naja nigricollis venom, a medically relevant spitting cobra from sub-Saharan Africa which
causes envenomings characterized by severe local tissue necrosis [36]. This finding offers
promise that a broad-spectrum toxin sequestrant to mitigate local tissue damage may be acces-
sible. The subcutaneous or intramuscular administration of these synthetic polymer NPs,
shortly after the bite at the site of envenoming, have the potential to halt or reduce the extent
of local tissue damage and prevent the systemic distribution of toxins post-envenoming.
Elapidae snake venom screening
Our report begins with an evaluation of the affinity of the abiotic hydrogel NP against a variety
of medically relevant elapid whole snake venoms. The monodisperse NP hydrogels (176 nm,
0.044 PDI by dynamic light scattering) (Fig 2C), synthesized via precipitation polymerization
with a feed ratio of 20% acrylic acid, 40% N-phenylacrylamide, 25% N-isopropylacrylamide,
and 15% N,N0-methylenebis (acrylamide) (Fig 2B) was tested for toxin-selectivity in human
serum by first subjecting the NP to concentrated human serum (25% (w/v), final concentra-
tion). Following a pre-incubation at 37˚C, a small quantity of whole venom (250 μg/mL, final
concentration) was added to the NP-serum mixture and incubated. After centrifugation and
multiple washing steps, the bound proteins that constitute the hard protein corona [37] of the
NP were examined via SDS-PAGE (Fig 2A). A representative venom extract from a species of
each genus was further analyzed by LC-MS/MS to confirm that toxins found in the control
experiments (Fig 3A) were also present in the NP-corona complex (Fig 3B) and to establish if
the NP sequesters isoforms of both PLA2 and 3FTXs families.
Compared to the serum-only control experiment (Fig 3 B2.0), which shows high quantities
of apolipoprotein-A1, the venom-containing experiments (Fig 3 B2.1–2.8) show that very
large quantities of low-molecular weight proteins (<15 kDa) are captured by the NP. Consid-
ering that venoms themselves are dominated by proteins with MWs below 15 kDa (Fig 3
A1.1–1.8), it is likely that the proteins of that MW in the NP binding experiments are the pre-
dominant ones in the venom. To verify this claim, the samples from experiments involving
Naja mossambica (Fig 3A1.1 and 3B2.1), Bungarus caeruleus (Fig 3A1.2 and 3B2.2), and Den-
droaspis polylepsis (Fig 3A1.8 and 3B2.8) venoms were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry
via an in-gel digestion with trypsin. The detected peptide fragments were analyzed using the
uniprot database of known venom proteins for each species [38]. Although many of these ven-
oms and those of closely related species (eg., Dendroaspis taxa [39]; N. melanoleuca [40]; B.
caeruleus [41]; N. sputatrix [42]; N. haje [43]; B. fasciatus [44]) have been characterized and
some of their toxins sequenced previously, the intraspecies variability of venoms does not
guarantee that all toxin isoforms found in the database are present in appreciable amounts in
our venom samples, and vice versa. Furthermore, many protein isoforms share high sequence
identity which can render protein identification via trypsin digestion difficult. Nevertheless,
proteomic analysis will at the very least establish whether the proteins in the venom control
(Fig 3A) are found in the NP protein corona (Fig 3B).
Naja mossambica venom, which is largely composed of cytotoxins from the 3FTX family
and PLA2s, can induce extensive cutaneous necrosis in its victims [36]. While the number of
3FTXs and PLA2 isoforms expressed in the venoms of this species likely varies ontogenetically

 and geographically, seven 3FTXs and three PLA2 isoforms have been attributed to this snake
venom via the Swiss-Prot database. Nine of the toxins were detected in the venom only control
experiment (Fig 3 A1.1) and eight of those toxins were found in the NP and serum containing
experiment (S1 Table). The lack of neurotoxin 2 (3S13_NAJMO) in the NP hard-corona com-
plex may be attributed to the overall low concentration of the neurotoxin in the venom.
Regardless, this experiment verified that the NP sequestered nearly all the isoforms of the
3FTXs and PLA2 toxins in N.mossambica venom in the presence of serum proteins.
A similar proteomic analysis was performed on the venom–serum uptake experiments
from Bungarus caeruleus, the common krait from India. Envenoming by B. caeruleus results in
severe neurotoxicity [45]. A major component of this venom is the PLA2 heterodimeric neuro-
toxin β-bungarotoxin, which features a PLA2 covalently attached to a Kunitz-type serine prote-
ase inhibitor [46]. LC-MS/MS analysis of the venom control (Fig 3 A 1.2) revealed six proteins:
Four monomeric PLA2s and two PLA2 toxins that are a component of β-bungarotoxin.
LC-MS/MS analysis of the NP-B. caeruleus experiment (Fig 3B 2.2) revealed that all six pro-
teins were present in the NP protein corona (S2 Table).
The third venom, Dendroaspis polylepsis, which is known for its fast-acting neurotoxic effect
[36], is well characterized and therefore a good candidate for proteomic assessment. Analysis
of the venom control (Fig 3A1.8) revealed eight unique 3FTXs and four different Kunitz-type
serine protease inhibitors which in this venom correspond to dendrotoxins, a group of neuro-
toxins that block the voltage-sensitive potassium channels in neurons [47]. Seven of the eight
3FTXs were found in the NP protein corona (Fig 3B2.8), Moreover, three of the four

 dendrotoxins were also found in the NP corona along with an acetylcholinesterase (S3 Table).
This underscores that NPs are able to bind not only 3FTXs and PLA2s, but also dendrotoxins,
which belong to a different structural family of neurotoxic venom proteins. This has evident
therapeutic implications when dealing with mamba snake venoms.
Despite differences in toxin composition across different species, these venom-selectivity
experiments support the hypothesis that the nanoparticles are able to bind to different struc-
tural determinants in different groups of toxins from elapid snake venoms over abundant
serum proteins. While the results indicate broad-sequestration of certain important venom
toxins of elapid sakes by the NP, this does not necessarily translate to broad-neutralization of
these toxins. To this point, we focused on the neutralization of necrotizing toxins, whose neu-
tralization by antivenoms is limited [10]. We identified venom from the African spitting
cobra, Naja nigricollis, as an ideal candidate for this study since envenoming from this species
is responsible for many cases in sub-Saharan Africa resultant in sequelae secondary to local
cutaneous necrosis [36, 48].
Selectivity for Naja nigricollis venom
The pathophysiology observed in envenomings caused by N.nigricollis results from a synergis-
tic effect involving numerous PLA2 and 3FTX isoforms [10]. 3FTXs, which comprise 73% of
the venom of N. nigricollis [49], are the major toxin family responsible for its toxicity [10]. We
first evaluated the protein corona of the NP in the presence of human serum and N. nigricollis
venom as described in the previous section.
Compared to the serum only control experiment, the addition of venom after an initial
serum incubation resulted in a dominant protein band in the molecular weight range observed
in the venom control (<15 kDa) (Fig 4). In the presence of serum alone, the NP favorably asso-
ciates with proteins of varying molecular weights. However, there is a distinct change in the
distribution and a new dominant molecular weight band (<15 kDa) in the venom-containing
corona experiment. Proteins that comprised the NP corona were identified via in gel digestion
followed by proteomic identification. Unlike the previous proteomic studies, venom from N.
nigricollis only has four toxins attributed to it in the UniProt database: one full-length PLA2,
two 30 amino acid fragments of PLA2 and a 51 amino acid peptidase inhibitor called nawaprin.
We therefore extended the database to include toxin sequences from the closely related species
Naja pallida which includes two 3FTXs (cytotoxin and neurotoxin). Analysis confirmed that
all the toxins observed in the N. nigricollis venom control were also observed in the NP protein
corona (S4 Table). These results were quite similar to the proteomics analysis of the related N.
mossambica venom-selectivity study in the previous section and reinforce the concept that the
NP is able to bind the most relevant toxin families in these snake venoms.
In vitro inhibition of Naja nigricollis venom
The toxin uptake studies with whole venom from the spitting cobra N. nigricollis and other ela-
pid snakes in the presence of serum proteins were encouraging. However, sequestration does
not necessarily translate to inhibition of toxicity. N. nigricollis induces cytotoxicity and pro-
duces substantial myonecrosis. To establish if the NP is capable of neutralizing myonecrosis in
vitro, we designed a cell viability study of rat skeletal muscle cells (L6) in the presence of N.
nigricollis venom and the NP.
The MTT assay was used to visualize metabolically active cells in the evaluation of the inhi-
bition of venom induced cytotoxicity by the NP. S11 Fig shows the cell viability of L6 cells
incubated with N. nigricollis venom (1–30 μg/mL, n = 4–5) in the presence and absence of
80 μg/mL NP. Results indicate that the NP is effective at neutralizing the toxicity from Naja

 nigricollis venom. A concentration of 7 μg/mL of N. nigricollis venom resulted in almost 100%
cytotoxicity of L6 cells in the absence of the NP. This concentration was selected for further
experiments to study the dose-response curve of the NP (Fig 5). The results show a dose-
dependent relationship between NP concentration and cell survival (Fig 5). The first concen-
tration to have a significant effect on cell survival is 49.6 μg/mL which resulted in 50% cell sur-
vival (half maximal effective concentration, EC50). In addition, a ratio of venom: NP (w/w)
ranging from 1:5 to 1:7 resulted in near complete inhibition of cytotoxicity. This was substan-
tially more potent than the reported ratio of South African antivenom (SAIMR) which
required a ratio greater than 1:150 venom: antivenom (w/w) to completely inhibit N. nigricollis
venom-induced cytotoxicity in L6 cells [50].
We also evaluated the efficacy of the NP to inhibit cytotoxicity of Naja mossambica venom,
another member of the Elapidae snake family to ensure that this result was not exceptional
(Fig 5B). The calculated EC50 is 23.2 μg/mL and a ratio ranging from 1:6 to 1:7 venom: NP (w/
w) brought about complete neutralization of N. mossambica venom toxicity in L6 cells. The
NPs have a much higher capacity than the reported ratio of SAIMR which required a ratio

 greater than 1:500 venom: antivenom (w/w) to completely suppress cytotoxicity induced by
this venom [50].
In vivo studies with the venom of Naja nigricollis
Both selective uptake studies with whole venom and the in vitro results suggest the NP func-
tions as a sequestrant for the major protein toxins of elapid snakes. We proceeded with an eval-
uation of the ability to mitigate in vivo the necrotic effects of venom of the African spitting
cobra N. nigricollis. In contrast with envenomings by the majority of cobras (Naja sp), which
are characterized by neurotoxic manifestations, those inflicted by N. nigricollis are character-
ized by a prominent cytotoxic effect, clinically manifested by blistering and local cutaneous
necrosis, which often end up in permanent sequelae such as chronic ulceration, hypertrophic
scars, keloid formation, blindness and, in some cases, malignant transformation [11, 36]. Pre-
vious in vitro studies and our current observations demonstrated the ability of NPs to seques-
ter and inhibit PLA2s and cytotoxins of the 3FTX family from the venom of the spitting cobra
Naja mossambica [32], and a closely related species, N. nigricollis. We next evaluated the ability
of the NP to inhibit the necrotic activity of the venom of N. nigricollis in skin. To this end, a
mouse experimental model developed in one of our laboratories [10] was used to assess the
efficacy of NPs.
Assessment of toxicity of NPs
Before assessing the ability of NPs to inhibit venom in vivo, the potential toxicity of NPs was
studied. Mice receiving 100 μL of NPs (5.5 mg/mL) by the intravenous route did not show any
evidence of toxicity nor any change in their behavior, as compared to mice receiving PBS. All
of them survived the 24 h observation period. Mice injected intramuscularly in the gastrocne-
mius with 50 μL of NPs did not show any problem for mobilization, and the plasma CK activ-
ity was not increased as compared to the plasma CK activity of mice injected with PBS

mL of N. mossambica measured 14 h after exposure to the cells (n = 4–5).

 (302 ± 352 U/L and 206 ± 120 U/L, respectively; p > 0.05) thus indicating lack of myotoxicity.
Moreover, intradermal injection of NPs did not cause any macroscopic effect in the skin. His-
tological assessment of tissue sections from liver, kidneys and heart (after intravenous injec-
tion), gastrocnemius muscle (after intramuscular injection), and skin (after intradermal
injection) showed a normal microscopic appearance (Fig 6D; S12 Fig) which did not differ
from that of tissue sections obtained from mice injected with PBS. Thus, under our experimen-
tal conditions, NPs did not induce toxicity in mice.
Inhibition of dermonecrosis
The NPs inhibited dose-dependently the dermonecrotic activity of N. nigricollis venom, as
visually assessed by the reduction or abrogation of the necrotic area (Fig 6A; Supplementary
S13 Fig). The estimated IR50 was 1.1 (NP: venom, w:w). Histological assessment confirmed the
inhibition of skin necrosis. Tissue from mice injected with venom incubated with PBS showed
a characteristic necrotic pattern, similar to that described by Rivel et al [10]. These lesions are
Fig 6. Inhibition of dermonecrotic activity of N. nigricollis venom by NPs. (A) A fixed amount of venom was incubated with variable amounts of NPs to attain
several ratios. Controls included venom incubated with saline solution instead of NPs. Upon incubation, aliquots of the mixtures, containing 100 μg venom, were
injected intradermally in mice. Seventy-two hours after injection, the areas of necrotic lesions in the inner side of the skin were measured. Necrosis was expressed
as percentage, 100% corresponding to the necrotic area (60 mm2) in mice receiving venom alone. NPs inhibited, dose-dependently, the dermonecrotizing activity
of the venom. (B, C, D) Light micrographs of sections of the skin of mice 72 h after injection of 100 μg N. nigricollis venom incubated with saline solution (B), with

by the presence of epidermis (arrow) and skin appendages, whereas an inflammatory infiltrate is observed in the dermis. Skin injected with NPs alone (D) shows a

damage.

 characterized by a central dark necrotic core and a peripheral whitish ring. Necrosis is character-
ized by loss of epidermis and of skin appendages, together with the accumulation of a hyaline
fibrinoid material, together with an abundant inflammatory infiltrate with predominance of poly-
morphonuclear leucocytes (Fig 6B). In contrast, skin samples from mice receiving venom and
NPs showed preservation of the epidermis and of the dermal structure and skin appendages, i.e.
inhibition of necrosis. However, the epidermis had an increased number of epithelial cell layers
and there was an inflammatory infiltrate in the dermis (Fig 6C), both of which reveal an ongoing
inflammatory process in the absence of necrosis. Tissue from mice injected with NPs alone
showed a histomorphology indistinguishable from that of mice receiving PBS alone (Fig 6D).
When inhibition experiments were performed by first injecting the venom and then, at var-
ious time intervals, the NPs, dermonecrosis was significantly reduced in all cases, although
inhibition diminished as time lapse between envenoming and treatment increased (Fig 6E).
These results establish that an abiotic synthetic polymer NP, engineered to bind to and
modulate the activity of a diverse array of PLA2 and 3FTX isoforms found in Elapidae snake
venoms, inhibit dose-dependently the dermonecrotic activity of N. nigricollis venom, the most
important clinical manifestation of envenomings by African spitting cobras. These two fami-
lies of protein toxins share features that are associated with their ability to bind and disrupt cell
membrane targets, thus allowing for NP sequestration that arises from a mechanism that dif-
fers from immunological (epitope) selection.
