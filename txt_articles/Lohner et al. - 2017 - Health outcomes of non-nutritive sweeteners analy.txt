Health outcomes of non-nutritive
sweeteners: analysis of the research
landscape
Szimonetta Lohner1, Ingrid Toews2 and Joerg J. Meerpohl2,3*
Abstract
Background: Food products containing non-nutritive sweeteners (NNSs) instead of sugar have become increasingly
popular in the last decades. Their appeal is obviously related to their calorie-free sweet taste. However, with the dramatic
increase in their consumption, it is reasonable and timely to evaluate their potential health benefits and, more importantly,
potential adverse effects. The main aim of this scoping review was to map the evidence about health outcomes possibly
associated with regular NNS consumption by examining the extent, range, and nature of research activity in this area.
Methods: We systematically searched Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane CENTRAL databases for studies on NNSs
(artificial sweeteners or natural, non-caloric sweeteners, either used individually or in combination) using text terms with
appropriate truncation and relevant indexing terms. All human studies investigating any health outcomes of a NNS
intervention or exposure were eligible for inclusion. No studies were excluded based on language, study design or
methodological quality. Data for each health outcome were summarized in tabular form and were discussed narratively.
Results: Finally, we included 372 studies in our scoping review, comprising 15 systematic reviews, 155 randomized
controlled trials (RCTs), 23 non-randomized controlled trials, 57 cohort studies, 52 case-control studies, 28 cross sectional
studies and 42 case series/case reports.
In healthy subjects, appetite and short term food intake, risk of cancer, risk of diabetes, risk of dental caries, weight gain
and risk of obesity are the most investigated health outcomes. Overall there is no conclusive evidence for beneficial
and harmful effects on those outcomes. Numerous health outcomes including headaches, depression, behavioral and
cognitive effects, neurological effects, risk of preterm delivery, cardiovascular effects or risk of chronic kidney disease
were investigated in fewer studies and further research is needed. In subjects with diabetes and hypertension, the
evidence regarding health outcomes of NNS use is also inconsistent.
Conclusions: This scoping review identifies the needs for future research to address the numerous evidence gaps
related to health effects of NNSs use.It also specifies the research questions and areas where a systematic review with
meta-analyses is required for the proper evaluation of health outcomes associated to regular NNSs consumption.

 Introduction
In the last decades, growing concerns about health and
quality of life have encouraged people to avoid the
consumption of food rich in sugar, salt or fat [1, 2]. With
increased consumer interest in reducing sugar intake,
food products containing calorie-free alternatives (non-
nutritive sweeteners; NNSs) have become increasingly
popular [3, 4]. NNSs are generallyseveral hundred to
several thousand times sweeter than sucrose [5]. Most of
them do not contain any calories while some NNSs (e.g.
aspartame) contain very few [6]. Each sweetener has
specific characteristics of sweetness intensity, persistence
of the sweet taste, coating of the teeth and aftertaste
effect [7, 8].
Most of the NNSs approved for human consumption
are synthetic (artificial sweeteners; AS). However, more
and more NNSs of natural origin are available on the
market (natural, non-caloric sweeteners; NNCSs). The
most familiar NNCSs are Stevia rebaudiana-based prod-
ucts. Steviol glycosides, extracted from the plant Stevia
include stevioside and rebaudioside A, but also other,
less common glycosides [9].
With regard to the range of approved ASs there are
differences among countries. In the United States for ex-
ample, there are currently six ASs which the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) has approved for consump-
tion (Table 1; [10] acesulfame-K, aspartame, neotame,
saccharin, sucralose and advantame). In the European
Union meanwhile, the range of currently approved ASs
is wider, also including, for example, cyclamate [11, 12].
Stevia has been used as a sweetener for decades in some
countries (e.g. Japan), while it was approved as a food
additive just recently by the European Food Safety Au-
thority (EFSA) [13] and the US FDA.
Parallel to the dramatic increase in the consumption of
food and beverages sweetened with NNSs, concerns have
been raised about their potential adverse health effects
[14–16]. Several studies investigated short-term conse-
quences (e.g. on food intake, mood, blood pressure);
others evaluated long-term health effects (e.g. on body
weight, incidence of obesity, risk of cancer, risk of diabetes
or dental caries) of NNSs. Overall, plenty of scientific
studies have been published, postulating a wide variety of
beneficial, but also negative health effects of NNSs.
Since scoping reviews are used to present a broad
overview of the evidence pertaining to a topic irrespect-
ive of study quality, they can be seen as a hypothesis-
generating
exercise
and
are
therefore
the
optimal
method for examining this emerging area as a first
approach [17]. The aim of this scoping review was to
map the available evidence about the health outcomes
possibly associated with regular NNS consumption by
examining the extent, range, and nature of research
activity in this area.
Objectives
Primary objectives of this scoping review were to:
� Identify all potential health outcomes associated
with regular NNS consumption;
� Define the number and types of primary studies (i.e.
studies that collect original data from subjects)
available for each health outcome;
� Identify any gaps in the evidence base for the health
outcomes of regular NNS consumption.
Secondary objective of this scoping review was to:
� Summarize available systematic reviews on the
association of NNS consumption and health
outcomes, compare their inclusion criteria and
limitations, and determine whether a new systematic
review in this area is justified.
Methods
We used the approach of a scoping review (including a
process known as evidence mapping) [18, 19] to compile
all relevant evidence about the health effects of NNS
consumption from the scientific literature. This ap-
proach is based on a systematic literature search and the
transparent assessment of the retrieved evidence for its
relevance for the research question by presenting an
overview of a potentially large and diverse body of litera-
ture pertaining to this broad research topic, without
making restrictions based on study design and method-
ology. Furthermore, it seeks to provide a descriptive

praisal of included individual studies.
Inclusion criteria
To be included, a primary study needed to meet all of the
following criteria: a) a study on human beings (of any age,
gender or health status); b) an intervention with or exposure
to any type and any dosage of ASs (aspartame, acesulfame
potassium, saccharin, sucralose, advantame, neotame, cycla-
mate, alitame, neohesperidin dihydrochalcone (DC)) or
NNCSs (stevioside, rebaudioside A, thaumatin, brazzein) or
NNSs (defined as any combination of AS and NNCS); c) a
study reporting health effects of any type (both health out-
comes and intermediate markers of health outcomes were
included); d) no restriction on study design or language.
We also included relevant systematic reviews on the
association of an NNS intervention/exposure and one or
more defined health outcomes (every review describing
or indicating a systematic search was regarded to be a
systematic review).
In this manuscript we report on relevant systematic
reviews, clinical trials, cohort studies, case-control and
cross-sectional studies.
Search strategy
Ovid MEDLINE (ovidsp.ovid.com), EMBASE (www.emba-
se.com) and the Cochrane CENTRAL database (www.co-
chranelibrary.com)
were searched from
inception to
October Week 2 2015 for studies on AS and to January
Week 3 2016 for studies on NNCS and NNS, using text
words with appropriate truncation and relevant indexing
terms (MeSH). The search was in the form [terms for
artificial sweeteners/ natural, non-caloric sweeteners/non-
nutritive sweeteners] and [human studies]. Electronic
searches were limited neither in time nor in language.
Electronic searches were followed by hand searching of
reference lists of relevant review articles and included
primary studies. Electronic searches were updated in May
Week 4 2017.
Data extraction and management
Titles and abstracts were screened for inclusion by a sin-
gle reviewer (SL). Only clearly irrelevant records were
excluded at this stage. All potentially relevant abstracts
and full papers were screened for inclusion by two
reviewers independently using an inclusion/exclusion
form specifically developed for the purpose of this scop-
ing review (SL and IT). In case of disagreement, the
subject was discussed among the two reviewers until a
mutual decision could be made. When this was not pos-
sible, a third reviewer (JM) was consulted. A data extrac-
tion sheet was designed and piloted. Then two reviewers
(SL and IT) independently extracted the following data for
each included primary study: 1) first author; 2) year of
publication; 3) study location; 4) study design; 5) aim of
the study; 6) main characteristics and size of the study
sample; 7) main characteristics of intervention/exposure
and control; 8) outcome measures with direction of effect.
Intervention studies were classified as RCTs (with ei-
ther parallel, or cross-over design) or non-randomized
controlled trials (non-RCTs), while observational studies
were classified as prospective or retrospective cohort
studies,
cross-sectional
studies,
case-control
studies,
ecological studies or case reports/case series. Data sheets
were compared and in case of differences in the
extracted data, the relevant information was checked
again in the study article and corrected.
Data for each health outcome were summarized in
tabular form and were discussed narratively. Bubble
charts were used to highlight the main relationship
among the types of NNS used in the studies as interven-
tion/exposure, the health effects and the study types.
Bubble charts are multi-variable graphs, whose plot
points along a grid where the X and Y axis are separate
variables (in our case they represent the type of sweet-
ener and health outcomes).Additionally, the different
colours of the plotted points represent a third variable
(in our case they show the study type).
For each included systematic review following data
were extracted: 1) first author; 2) year of publication; 3)
date of search; 4) databases searched 5) aim of the
review; 6) study design of eligible studies; 7) main
characteristics of eligible intervention/exposure; 8) out-
come(s) eligible for inclusion.
Results
The flow diagram of the literature search (PRISMA Flow
Diagram adapted for the scoping review process) is
shown in Fig. 1. For ASs a total of 7970 articles were
identified in the initial literature search, of which 669
appeared to be potentially relevant. Fifteen papers could
not be retrieved; all others were available for detailed
full-text assessment. Finally, 317 articles fulfilled the
inclusion criteria. This search focused on studies with
ASs as the intervention or exposure; however, 11
primary studies with NNSs, 28 studies with diet bever-
ages/diet sodas and one study with a combination of
NNSs and sugar-alcohols were already identified at this
stage. For NNCSs and NNSs, 3087 articles were identi-
fied in the original literature search, 112 full texts were
screened for eligibility and finally 55 were included in
the review. In 2017, after the update search of databases,
48 further studies were eligible for inclusion.
In total, 24 systematic reviews (Table 2), 175 randomized
controlled trials (RCTs), 29 non-randomized controlled
clinical trials (non-RCTs), 62 cohort studies, 52 case-
control studies and 36 cross-sectional studies were included
in this scoping review. We also found 42 case studies.

 Health outcomes assessed in the included studies
Health outcomes by intervention as investigated in
primary studies are shown in Fig. 2. We first report short-
term outcomes (appetite and short-term food intake), then
long-term health outcomes in healthy populations (in
alphabetical order: cancer, chronic kidney disease, dental
caries, diabetes, headaches, neurocognitive outcomes, ob-
stetric outcomes, weight gain and obesity). Finally, health
outcomes in non-healthy populations are described.
Short-term outcomes
Appetite and short term food intake
Eating behavior and metabolic effects due to the exposure
to NNSs were investigated in five systematic reviews among
other outcomes [20–24]. One review reported evidence for
an appetite lowering effect of aspartame, whereas the other
reviews reported conflicting evidence for the effects of Ste-
via and ASs in general on eating behavior.
The primary studies on short-term food intake focused
on whether exposure to NNSs enhances the desire for
sweet foods and drinks, leading to an increased food in-
take. From the included 60 primary studies, 32 were
small, cross-over RCTs [25–56] with a similar design:
the subjects first consumed a “preload”, a food or drink
sweetened with either NNSs or with sugar (a nutritive
sweetener) or a food or drink which did not contain any
sweetener (e.g. water). After a time delay subjects were
offered an ad libitum meal and total energy intake was
measured.
No effects of NNSs on short-term food intake or sub-
jective awareness of hunger were described in 39 studies
(9 parallel RCTs [53, 57–64], 22 cross-over RCTs [25–29,
31, 33–39, 41, 43, 46, 50, 51, 53–56], 7 non-RCTs [45, 65–
70] and 1 case-control study [71]); 10 studies described an
increased [32, 40, 45, 47, 49, 52, 72–75], while 11 studies
described a decreased food intake or appetite [30, 42, 48,
76–83] in the NNSs intervention group as compared to
the sugar-receiving or placebo group.
Long-term health outcomes in healthy populations
Cancer
Berry et al. [84] systematically summarized studies on
the carcinogenic potential of sucralose and concluded
that sucralose does not demonstrate carcinogenic activ-
ity even when exposure levels are several orders of mag-
nitude greater than the range of anticipated daily

 ingestion levels. Another, broadly focused systematic
review published in 2015 [85] assessed cancer risk
among several other health outcomes. Authors of this
review also searched for diet beverage studies, but only
narratively summarized their results and concluded
that, based on the available data, it was not possible
to establish a link between cancer risk and the con-
sumption of ASs.
In total, we identified 51 primary studies assessing the
association of NNS consumption and cancer risk. The
investigated exposure was use of any type of ASs or use
of a subtype of ASs (saccharin or aspartame) in 47
studies, while 4 studies investigated exposure to NNCSs.
Cancer outcomes by type of exposure as investigated in
primary studies are shown in Fig. 3.
Out of the identified 41 case-control studies reporting
on the effect of NNSs on cancer, 32 assessed the
relationship between NNS consumption and the risk of
developing bladder cancer or urinary tract cancer. The
results of these studies are controversial: 11 case-control
studies describe a positive association between AS/NNS
intake and bladder or urinary tract cancer risk [86–96],
while 20 report no association [97–116].
Two case-control studies assessed the risk of brain
cancer (no association with AS use [117, 118]), 1 study
assessed the risk for colorectal cancer (significantly
increased with AS use [119]), 2 studies investigated the
risk of pancreatic cancer (no association with NNSs
[120, 121]), 1 study investigated the risk of breast cancer
(no association with AS use [122]) and 4 studies investi-
gated the risk of any type or more types of cancer (no
association with NNS use [123–126]).
Three prospective cohort studies investigated the risk
of lymphomas or other hematological malignancies

retrospective cohort studies assessed the risk of bladder

The cross-sectional study described that breast cancer
survivors compared to age-matched controls had signifi-
cantly lower intakes of NNSs [134].
Chronic kidney disease
In a systematic review by Cheungpasitporn et al. [135],
the 4 included studies assessed the association between
consumption of artificially sweetened soda and chronic
kidney disease. The authors concluded that consuming
artificially sweetened soda did not increase the risk of
chronic kidney disease in high-risk patients.

NNS consumption and the risk of developing chronic
kidney
disease
were

We found 16 intervention studies (14 RCTs [141–154]
and 2 non-RCTs [155, 156]) on the association of an
NNS intervention and dental health. Details of these
studies are summarized in Table 3.
Only two of the studies mentioned above described no
differences between intervention and control groups
[142, 155]; all other studies described a less acidogenic
(increased) oral pH after the intervention as compared
to the sugar-containing control.

 Diabetes
In a systematic review published in 2014 [157], three
included publications on 4 cohorts investigated the asso-
ciation between intake of artificially sweetened soft
drinks and risk of type-2 diabetes [158–160] using
additional information provided by the authors of two of
the publications [158, 159]. The review reported an in-
creased risk of diabetes when consuming 330 ml/day of
artificially sweetened soft drinks; however, substantial
heterogeneity was described among the cohort studies.
Also, another systematic review published in 2016 [161]
described a positive association between the consump-
tion
of
artificially
sweetened
beverages
and
type-2
diabetes incidence; however, the authors of this review
rated their findings as biased.
We found 6 prospective cohort studies (4 with an AS
exposure and 2 with a “diet beverage” exposure), 1
retrospective cohort study (with AS exposure) and 1
case-control study (with AS exposure) on the risk of
developing diabetes. These studies are summarized
in Table 4.
Among the studies investigating the exposure to AS, 2
prospective cohort studies [162, 163] and one case-
control study [164] described an increased risk of type-2
diabetes, while 2 prospective [160, 165] and 1 retrospect-
ive cohort studies [166] found no association between
AS consumption and risk of diabetes. There were no
studies investigating diabetes risk in association with
NNCS consumption.
Headaches
We found 3 RCTs [167–169] with a cross-over design
and 2 cohort studies [170, 171] investigating the effect of
AS on headaches. These included either healthy popula-
tions
or
populations
with
a
subjectively
reported
sensitivity to AS or people with a history of migraines.
Two of them (one RCT [168] and one cohort study
[170]) described a significant positive association, in the
others no significant association was found between AS
consumption and headaches.
Cognitive effects, mental health
RCTs assessing the behavior and mood of essentially
healthy children after they were given a preload of either
an artificially sweetened or sugar-sweetened food or
beverage found no consistent effect of ASs on behavior.
Most of the interventional and observational studies in-
vestigating the effect of an AS preload on cognitive
abilities in healthy children and adults demonstrated that
there was no association between cognitive performance,
measured by an array of tests, and the intake of ASs in
different forms.
Three studies (2 RCTs and 1 cohort study) investigated
the effect of AS on depression and described an
increased risk of developing depression symptoms or in-
creased severity of symptoms in mood disorder patients
[172–174]. In 1 case-control study, consumption of
saccharin was significantly positively associated with the
risk of Alzheimer’s disease [175].
Obstetric outcomes
Three cohort studies investigated the effect of AS con-
sumption and preterm delivery [176–178], two of them
describing a significant positive, while one described no
association. One case-control study described no associ-
ation between saccharin use before conception or during
pregnancy and spontaneous abortion [179].
Weight change
We found 4 systematic reviews addressing the question
whether NNS consumption has an unfavorable or favor-
able effect on body weight [22, 180–182]. Details of
these reviews are described in Table 2. Miller et al. [181]
indicated, based on data from RCTs, that substituting
low-calorie sweeteners (LCS, including NNSs and sugar-
alcohols) for calorically dense alternatives resulted in a
modest reduction of body weight, body mass index
(BMI), fat mass, and waist circumference. Rogers et al.
[182] concluded, based on results of relevant RCTs, that
low-energy sweetener consumption does not increase
body weight. The meta-analysis of observational studies
showed a significant positive association between LCS
intake and slightly increased BMI, but no association
with body weight or fat mass. Pereira et al. [180] con-
cluded that results of the epidemiologic studies are
highly inconsistent.
A systematic review [22] focusing on metabolic health
effects of AS consumption in pediatric populations
identified 3 large cohort studies with long-term follow-
up, supporting the existence of an association between
ASB (artificially sweetened beverage) consumption and
weight gain in children, while 2 other prospective cohort
studies described no or an inverse association with obes-
ity. The identified 3 RCTs on children described no
differences in weight or BMI between the NNS and the
control groups.
Another systematic review [183] focusing on long-
term metabolic effects of early NNS consumption con-
cluded that the current evidence of the long-term meta-
bolic effects of NNS exposure during gestation, infancy,
and childhood is limited and inconsistent.
We found 31 interventional studies (27 RCTs [58, 61,
62, 74, 77, 184–205] and 4 non-RCTs [67, 68, 79, 206])
and 36 observational studies [158, 159, 202, 203, 207–241]
on the effect of NNS consumption on BMI or weight
change, including recently published studies, which were
not included in the systematic reviews presented above.
Lohner et al. Nutrition Journal  (2017) 16:55 
Page 12 of 21
 Of the 27 RCTs, 14 reported a weight reduction after
the intervention with NNSs or diet beverages, 2 reported
an increase in weight, while in 11 RCTs no weight
change was observed. After subdividing the RCTs ac-
cording to the type of exposure, we found 15 RCTs with
an AS intervention, 8 describing a decrease in body
weight after the AS intervention as compared to the
(sugar-containing or unmodified) control intervention, 1
describing an increase, while in 6 AS intervention
studies no differences were observed between the two
groups. There were 3 RCTs with a NNCS (stevia) inter-
vention [187, 204, 242]. None of them described a differ-
ence in change of body weight between the intervention
and control groups.
Of the 17 prospective cohort studies, 10 described a
positive association (either statistically significant or a
non-significant trend) between NNS or diet beverage
consumption and weight gain/increased BMI [159, 207–
211,
216,
218,
237,
239],
3
observed
an
inverse
association [214, 215, 217], while in 4 prospective cohort
studies no association [212, 213, 219, 220] between body
weight and NNS consumption was found. When investi-
gating the subgroup of prospective cohort studies with a
clear AS intervention (8 studies), we found 7 studies
describing a positive [208–210, 216, 218, 237, 239] and 1
study describing no association [219] between AS con-
sumption and weight gain/increased BMI. There were
no cohort studies with a NNCS intervention reporting
on weight gain or obesity.
Of the 17 cross-sectional studies, 12 described a positive
[158, 222–226, 229–233, 241], 2 a negative [227, 235] and
3 no association [221, 228, 234] between NNS or diet bev-
erage consumption and weight gain/increased BMI.
Health outcomes in non-healthy populations (diabetes
and hypertension)
There are two main disease groups with a relatively wide
literature of NNS intervention studies. In type-1 and
type-2 diabetes patients, the effects of NNS use on dia-
betic control, including, but not limited to, blood
glucose levels, postprandial blood glucose, and glycated
hemoglobin (HbA1c), are widely investigated. We found
21 interventional studies (13 RCTs [33, 198, 243–253]
and 4 non-RCTs [254–257] with an AS intervention,
and 4 RCTs [193, 258–260]) and 2 non-RCT with an
NNCS intervention [261] on this topic.Most of the
studies described no difference in diabetic patients on
diabetic control between the NNS intervention and the
control group. Some studies investigated the glycemic
effects of NNSs in people with insulin resistance and im-
paired glucose tolerance [204, 206, 262].
The other disease group consists of hypertensive pa-
tients, where the role of NNSs in blood pressure control
has been investigated. We found 9 RCTs [187, 193, 242,
259, 263–267], 4 prospective cohort studies [268–271], 1
case-control study [272] and 1 cross-sectional study
[273] on this question, with controversial results.
Discussion
Summary of findings
Overall the evidence for health outcomes of AS is incon-
sistent and there are numerous gaps in the evidence
base. In healthy subjects, appetite and short term food
intake, risk of cancer, risk of diabetes, risk of dental
caries, weight gain and risk of obesity were the most in-
vestigated health outcomes.
In case of the health outcome appetite and short term
food intake, a majority of studies were short interven-
tions with a cross-over design. A smaller part were
randomized
controlled
trials
with
an
intervention
duration of 4 weeks up to 18 months. In case of the lon-
ger interventions, the type and dosage of the NNS was
often not defined.
Bladder cancer and cancer of the urinary tract were in-
vestigated in multiple studies. For this type of cancer a
systematic review may provide conclusive evidence.
Most of the studies on urinary tract cancer investigated
effects of artificial sweeteners in general; a smaller
number investigated the effects of aspartame or sac-
charin. Other types of cancer were investigated in only
one or a low number of studies.
We also found several studies on the role of NNS in
dental caries prevention. Included studies suggested that
stevia in chewing gum or NNCS beverages instead of
sugar-sweetened beverages may be an effective tool for
dental caries prevention. However, it has to be men-
tioned, that while sugar alcohols are widely used in
chewing gums for caries prevention, and the literature
on their effects is broad, the effects of NNCS on dental
caries is investigated in a limited number of studies. In
addition, in these studies, NNCSs were often combined
with sugar alcohols. It would be interesting to see more
comparative studies on the effectiveness of NNCS alone
versus other interventions in influencing dental plaque
pH; or studies with a longer intervention period and
follow-up.
The effect of NNS on risk of diabetes was investigated
in a limited number of cohort studies. These studies
mainly focused on artificially sweetened beverage or diet
beverage consumption and described different directions
of effect. Further studies, focusing on special types of
NNS (also including NNCS), are required.
Intervention studies on weight change focused mainly
on the question whether NNS can be efficiently used in
weight management. As part of weight loss intervention
programs, more intervention studies would be required,
to investigate the effects of NNS alone on body weight
in both overweight, obese and normal-weight subjects.
Lohner et al. Nutrition Journal  (2017) 16:55 
Page 13 of 21
 This would be especially important, since it is very
difficult in observational studies to evaluate causality be-
tween NNS consumption and BMI/weight change and
therefore results of these studies have to be interpreted
with
caution.
A positive
association between NNS
consumption and weight gain in observational studies
may be the consequence of and not the reason for over-
weight and obesity. Moreover, other factors, such as
population characteristics, may influence the results of
observational studies.
In subjects with diabetes, the effects of NNS were in-
vestigated mainly on glycemic control. Because of the
heterogeneous, if not contradictory results, a thorough
analysis of these findings in a full-fledged systematic
review including meta-analyses, subgroup and sensitivity
analyses is needed and might help to resolve some of the
ongoing uncertainties. Further studies on long-term
patient-relevant outcomes in diabetes are required.
The effect of NNS on lowering blood pressure in
hypertensive patients should also be analyzed in a high
quality systematic review and meta-analysis.
Regarding NNCS, although Stevia is increasingly used
as a sweetener, the number of studies on its health
effects is limited as of now. Studies investigating the ef-
fects of NNCS on cancer or diabetes risk are completely
lacking, while there are only few studies on weight gain
and obesity risk. Clearly, there is a need for further
research.
Eligible NNS not addressed by any of the included pri-
mary studies were: neotame, alitame, neohesperidin DC,
thaumatin and brazzein.
Strength and limitations of this scoping review
The strength of our scoping review is its inclusion of all
types of primary studies and systematic reviews which
investigate any health effect of any NNS in any popula-
tion. We are therefore able to present a comprehensive
overview of the available scientific evidence on health
effects of NNS.
Our scoping review might be limited by the following
factors. Firstly, the literature search was conducted in
three major and comprehensive databases, but we might
have inadvertently missed relevant studies listed in other
databases. Secondly, the title abstract screening was
conducted by one reviewer who might have inadvert-
ently excluded relevant studies at the first stage of the
screening. This limitation might be evened out by con-
ducting the literature search in two steps. In the second
step, relevant references for both topics were identified
and the chances for including all relevant references in
our review were increased.
Detailed assessment of the study quality is not covered
in a scoping review and was not conducted in the context
of our scoping review. Therefore, information gathered on
the health outcome includes only its direction of effect
but no information on the internal or external validity of
the study results.
Discussion of findings in light of other evidence
summaries
In our scoping review we found a large number of
studies of different designs, investigating effects of differ-
ent types of NNS in different populations on a variety of
health outcomes.
Systematic
reviews
to
summarize
the
available
evidence are already available (Table 2). However, they
often have methodological limitations (e.g. language
limitation of the search, electronic search in only one
database, etc.) or a narrow scope.
There are systematic reviews, which also included key
words for “diet soda” and “diet beverage” in their search
strategy. There are several, primarily observational stud-
ies, where the exposure is defined as “diet”, which may
indicate NNS-containing beverages, but further details
are
often
not
provided.
Therefore,
it
is
clearly
a
challenge when trying to synthesize the evidence to
decide, how to deal with studies describing the interven-
tion/exposure as “diet beverage”, “diet drink” or “diet
soda” only. We also included such studies in this scoping
review; however, it has to be mentioned that we did not
include specific search terms for “diet” beverages/sodas
in our search strategy, therefore the list of studies
reporting on the effects of diet beverage etc. may be
incomplete.
Implications of findings for practice, policy and future
research
Current evidence demonstrates that there is a need for
both further primary research and high quality compre-
hensive systematic reviews including meta-analyses, to
inform
future
recommendations
about
the
health
benefits and risks of NNS to advise and support health
care practice and public health decision-making.
This scoping review highlights the need for studies
which investigate the long-term effects of individual
sweeteners on some of the less well-researched health
outcomes (e.g. headaches, depression or other mood
disorders, Alzheimer’s disease, risk of preterm delivery).
Future studies need to be rigorous in design and
conduct, with well-defined interventions (providing in-
formation on type and dosage of the non-nutritive
sweetener) and controls. Study reports should include
detailed descriptions of all methodological aspects to en-
able proper interpretation of the results.
Systematic reviews are required for health outcomes
with a large number of primary studies, but without
conclusive evidence (e.g. appetite and short term food
intake, risk of cancer, dental caries, risk of diabetes,
Lohner et al. Nutrition Journal  (2017) 16:55 
Page 14 of 21
 glycaemic control in subjects with diabetes and blood
pressure control in hypertensive patients) to support the
formulation of recommendations and to be able to
decide whether further, well-designed primary studies
are required.
Conclusions
There are numerous gaps in evidence related to the
health effects of NNS in both healthy and non-healthy
populations. In healthy subjects appetite and short term
food intake, risk of cancer, risk of diabetes, risk of dental
caries are the most investigated health outcomes, all of
them without any conclusive evidence. There is a need
for well-conducted systematic reviews to quantitatively
summarize results and assess their validity. Besides,
there are numerous health outcomes, like incidence of
headaches
in
association
with
NNS
consumption,
depression, Alzheimer’s disease, risk of preterm delivery,
behavioural effects, cardiovascular effects or risk of
chronic kidney disease, which were investigated in only
few studies and further research activity is needed. A
systematic review may also help to enable formulating
recommendations for subjects with diabetes and hyper-
tension on using NNS.
