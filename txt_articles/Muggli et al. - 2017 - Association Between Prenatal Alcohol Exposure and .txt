IMPORTANCE Children who receive a diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder may have a
characteristic facial appearance in addition to neurodevelopmental impairment. It is not well
understood whether there is a gradient of facial characteristics of children who did not
receive a diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder but who were exposed to a range of
common drinking patterns during pregnancy.
OBJECTIVE To examine the association between dose, frequency, and timing of prenatal
alcohol exposure and craniofacial phenotype in 12-month-old children.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A prospective cohort study was performed from
January 1, 2011, to December 30, 2014, among mothers recruited in the first trimester of
pregnancy from low-risk, public maternity clinics in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. A
total of 415 white children were included in this analysis of 3-dimensional craniofacial images
taken at 12 months of age. Analysis was performed with objective, holistic craniofacial
phenotyping using dense surface models of the face and head. Partial least square regression
models included covariates known to affect craniofacial shape.
EXPOSURES Low, moderate to high, or binge-level alcohol exposure in the first trimester or
throughout pregnancy.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Anatomical differences in global and regional craniofacial
shape between children of women who abstained from alcohol during pregnancy and
children with varying levels of prenatal alcohol exposure.
RESULTS Of the 415 children in the study (195 girls and 220 boys; mean [SD] age, 363.0 [8.3]
days), a consistent association between craniofacial shape and prenatal alcohol exposure was
observed at almost any level regardless of whether exposure occurred only in the first
trimester or throughout pregnancy. Regions of difference were concentrated around the
midface, nose, lips, and eyes. Directional visualization showed that these differences
corresponded to general recession of the midface and superior displacement of the nose,
especially the tip of the nose, indicating shortening of the nose and upturning of the nose tip.
Differences were most pronounced between groups with no exposure and groups with low
exposure in the first trimester (forehead), moderate to high exposure in the first trimester
(eyes, midface, chin, and parietal region), and binge-level exposure in the first trimester
(chin).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Prenatal alcohol exposure, even at low levels, can influence
craniofacial development. Although the clinical significance of these findings is yet to be
determined, they support the conclusion that for women who are or may become pregnant,
avoiding alcohol is the safest option.

 P
renatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is a major preventable
cause of health and developmental problems in chil-
dren. It may cause irreversible damage to the brain, re-
sultinginfetalalcoholspectrumdisorder(FASD),whichischar-
acterized by learning difficulties, executive dysfunction,
impaired speech, motor problems, and behavior problems.1
Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder may affect 3% to 5% of
mainstream school-aged children, with many remaining
undiagnosed.2Fetalalcoholsyndrome(FAS)isdiagnosedwhen
cognitive impairment occurs together with abnormalities of
growth and a characteristic facial phenotype. Diagnostic cri-
teria of FAS include short palpebral fissures, flat philtrum, and
thin upper lip,3 but the condition has also been associated with
midfacialandauricularanomalies.4Detailedmorphologicstud-
ies of the face have found a reduction in ear length and mid-
facial hypoplasia, evidenced by reduced midfacial depth and
flattening of the nasal bridge and malar regions and a reduc-
tion in the size of the neurocranium and face (reduced upper
facial width, head circumference, and total facial height), as
well as retrognathia and micrognathia (reduced bigonial
breadth), in individuals who received a diagnosis of partial FAS
and in individuals with heavy PAE who do not meet the diag-
nostic criteria for FASD.5-7 Furthermore, comparisons of the
physical characteristics of children with FASD and the physi-
cal characteristics of children without FASD have shown that
maternal drinking measures significantly correlated with fa-
cial dysmorphology, with higher levels of drinking predicting
higher dysmorphology scores.8-10 Together these findings sug-
gest a possible dose-related association between PAE and cra-
niofacial shape.
Most of the studies cited have used facial measurements,
which capture limited information and are prone to measure-
ment error, or used clinical examination, which may be
subjective. In 2013, Suttie and colleagues5 used objective,
spatially dense morphometric techniques to analyze
3-dimensional (3-D) photographs in a social setting in which
high alcohol intake is common. These techniques enable the
analysis of the whole facial surface and do not require subjec-
tive assessment. In their study, FAS and partial FAS pheno-
types were characterized by the difference between the aver-
agefacialshapeofcontrolindividualsandindividualswithFAS
or partial FAS. They also performed a clustering analysis of in-
dividual faces and found that some children with heavy PAE
displayed anomalies consistent with FAS or partial FAS. Here,
weextendthisworktoexaminethephenotypeofchildrenwho
did not receive a diagnosis of FASD but who had lower levels
of PAE, by using a shape regression–based approach, which al-
lows us to control for covariates while comparing average faces
statistically.11
Methods
Study Population
Asking Questions About Alcohol in Pregnancy (AQUA) is a
population-based longitudinal study of the neurodevelop-
mental outcomes in children with PAE, with a focus on low to
moderatealcoholconsumption.12Participantsare1570women
and their offspring, recruited in early pregnancy during a 12-
month period from July 25, 2011, to July 30, 2012, from low-
risk public maternity clinics in Melbourne, Australia. Three-
dimensional craniofacial images were captured at 12 months
from a subset of 517 participants. Included in this analysis are
the images of 415 white children whose mothers were not life-
time abstainers and for whom we have complete information
on all covariates. The AQUA study was approved by the
Human Research Ethics Committees of Eastern Health (E54/
1011),MercyHealth(R11/14),MonashHealth(11071B),theRoyal
Women’
s Hospital (11/20), and the Royal Children’
s Hospital
(31055A) in Melbourne, Australia. Mothers provided written
consent prior to image capture.
Measurement of Alcohol Exposure
Questionnaires were collected that had detailed information
on the quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption for the
3 months before pregnancy and for each trimester, including
the time prior to recognition of pregnancy. Frequency of drink-
ing and typical amount and type of alcoholic drink were com-
bined to provide a single-exposure measure for each stage of
pregnancy, expressed in grams of absolute alcohol (AA) and
using algorithms previously described.13-15
Exposure levels were low (≤20 g of AA per occasion and
≤70 g of AA per week), moderate (21-49 g of AA per occasion
and ≤70 g of AA per week), high (>70 g of AA per week), and
binge (≥50 g of AA per occasion).12 Mothers who were absti-
nent throughout pregnancy comprised the control group for
all analyses.
Analysis used a 3-tiered approach in which PAE tier 1 con-
sisted of children of women who drank any alcohol while preg-
nant.Tier2subdividedtheexposuregroupintothosewithPAE
in the first trimester only and those with PAE throughout preg-
nancy. Tier 3 further subdivided the exposure group into low,
moderate to high, or binge-level drinking before becoming
aware of pregnancy and whether exposure occurred in the first
trimester only or throughout pregnancy.

Key Points
Question Is there an association between different levels of
prenatal alcohol exposure and child craniofacial shape at 12
months?
Findings This cohort study conducted an objective and sensitive
craniofacial phenotype analysis of 415 children, which showed an
association between prenatal alcohol exposure and craniofacial
shape at almost every level of exposure examined. Differences in
the midface and nose resemble midface anomalies associated with
fetal alcohol spectrum disorder.
Meaning Any alcohol consumption has consequences on
craniofacial development, supporting advice that complete
abstinence from alcohol while pregnant is the safest option; it
remains unclear whether the facial differences are associated
neurocognitive outcomes of prenatal alcohol exposure.

day, at the Royal Children’
s Hospital in Melbourne, Australia.
Imageacquisitionwasviathe3dMD7-podsystem(3dMDCorp),
which captures a 360° image of the head, including the face
and cranium. To ensure that images were unobscured by hair
and to capture the shape of the neurocranium, a tight-fitting
stocking was placed over the cranial vault. A neutral facial ex-
pression was not ensured at all times, and some images were
taken with the mouth open and others with the mouth closed.
Mouth position in the images was subsequently standardized
individually using a previously published method16 to en-
sure that each image had a neutral expression.
Craniofacial Measurement
Craniofacial measurement was undertaken by a researcher
(H.M.) blinded to the participants’PAE group. To represent the
entiresurfaceoftheface,aspatiallydensearrayof69 587points
on a template 1-year-old face (derived with bootstrapping17)
was automatically placed onto each target image by a 3-D
surface registration algorithm. This process gradually warps
the shape of the template into the shape of the target face,18,19
thus sampling each face at corresponding locations across
the entire surface. Each point configuration was made
symmetrical.17 The location, orientation, and size of all
point configurations were standardized using generalized
Procrustes analysis.20 Fitting of the template was performed
in Mevislab, a platform for medical image visualization and de-
veloping image processing algorithms (http://www.mevislab
.de), using custom-built modules developed at Katholieke
Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.19

and maternal smoking in pregnancy, a risk factor for malfor-
mations of the head and face.22 The child’

maternal prepregnancy body mass index were included
as factors potentially resulting in greater fat deposition around
the cheeks.

tion between PAE and craniofacial shape. Although the mea-
sure is subjective, self-perceived alcohol effects may serve as
a proxy variable, coding for unknown, complex, polygenic de-
terminants of alcohol metabolism.
Statistical Analysis
The distribution of PAE groups and covariates was described
using frequency counts and percentages if categorical, and
mean (SD) values if continuous. To test for a difference in cra-
niofacialshapebetweenthecontrolandeachPAEgroupineach
tier, partial least squares regression models were fitted. Par-
tial least squares regression was chosen because the point con-
figurations are highly collinear and because there are more
point coordinates than observations (faces). All models in-
cluded PAE group (coded as control = 0 and PAE = 1) to model
the association with PAE. The predictors listed were con-
trolled for by including them in each partial least squares re-
gression model. A second analysis computed the same regres-
sion models to examine any association between craniofacial
differences and PAE, stratified according to self-perceived
alcohol effects.
At the global and regional level, the statistical association
that controlled for covariates (partial R2) was computed. Sta-
tistical significance was computed at the global level using a
permutation test with 1000 permutations.23(p278) P < .05 was
considered significant. Given that analysis of almost 70 000
points results in mean differences that vary across the face,
craniofacialanatomicaldifferencesassociatedwithPAEateach
point were plotted using false colormaps, which show a ge-
neric face with each point indexed in color to the amount of
difference and highlighting which regions were more changed
or less changed.11,24 Partial R2, total anatomical difference, and
differenceinlateralandverticaldirectionsanddepthwereplot-
ted using separate colormaps.
For partial least squares regression and permutation test-
ing, we used a custom-written code (by H.M.) in the Python
programming language. The figures were generated using the
Mayavi 3D visualization library (http://code.enthought.com
/projects/mayavi/).
Results
The characteristics of the children included in the analysis are
summarized in Table 1. The cohort included 220 boys and 195
girls with a mean (SD) age of 363.0 (8.3) days at imaging. Of
the 326 children with PAE, 133 (40.8%) were exposed in the
first trimester only and 193 (59.2%) throughout the preg-
nancy.
Global and Regional Association
Between PAE and Craniofacial Shape
There was no significant association between PAE and cranio-
facial shape at the global level (Table 2). There were, how-
ever, regional mean differences in craniofacial shape of chil-
dren exposed to any alcohol (tier 1), regardless of whether PAE
occurred in the first trimester only or throughout pregnancy
(tier 2) (Figure 1). Regions of difference were concentrated
around the midface, nose, lips, and eyes. Directional visual-
ization showed that these differences corresponded to a gen-
eral recession of the midface (Figure 1; blue areas in the depth
section) and a superior displacement of points of the nose, es-
pecially the tip of the nose (Figure 1; red areas in the vertical
section), indicating a shortening of the nose and upturning of
the nose tip. This craniofacial phenotype was evident in both
tiers 1 and 2.
In tier 3, changes were most marked with moderate to
high PAE in the first trimester around eyes, midface, chin,
and parietal region and with binge-level PAE in the first tri-
mester around the lower lip. More important, a consistent
phenotype comprising a recessed midface and upturned

with binge-level exposure in the first trimester only, where
the recession was confined to the chin (retrognathia).
Overall, point differences reached a maximum of 1.2 mm
between groups.

 reportedfeelingtheeffectsofalcoholslowlyorveryslowlyow-
ing to small group numbers). For children of those who felt the
effects of alcohol normally, there was no significant global as-
sociation in any exposure category (Table 3). Overall, the cra-
niofacial phenotype was similar to that in the unstratified
analysis but was more pronounced in the stratum of mothers
who reported feeling the effect of alcohol very quickly or
quickly. There was also a significant association at the global
level in those who drank throughout in the tier 2 and tier 3
analyses (with the exception of the binge-level category). Re-
gional associations with PAE (Figure 2) reached a difference
of 1.6 mm in the forehead and midface in the stratum of moth-
ers who reported feeling the effect of alcohol very quickly or
quickly.
Association of Covariates With Craniofacial Shape
There were significant global differences in craniofacial
shape associated with maternal age, prepregnancy body
mass index, children’
s birth weight, and child’
s sex. Mater-
nal smoking during pregnancy was not associated with cra-
niofacial shape at a global level. The tier 1 regression model
showing these associations is in eTable in the Supplement
(global associations) and eFigure in the Supplement (re-
gional associations).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the asso-
ciation between the face of the child and common patterns of
PAE, using objective, holistic methods of craniofacial pheno-
typing. A consistent association with craniofacial shape was
observed in almost all exposure groups, with differences con-
centrated on regions around the nose, eyes, upper lips, and
lower lips. Results indicate a mild midfacial recession sugges-
tive of subclinical hypoplasia and an upturning of the nasal tip
inthoseexposedtoalcoholprenatally.Thisphenotypewasevi-
dentevenwhendrinkingwasatalowlevelandmothersceased
alcohol consumption in the first trimester.
In the unstratified analysis, we observed the strongest
association with facial shape in children of mothers who
drank at moderate levels in the first trimester only. In the
stratified analysis, craniofacial differences were strongest in
children of mothers who said they felt the effects of alcohol
quickly, particularly if they continued drinking throughout
pregnancy and initially drank at moderate levels. The appar-
ent discrepancy between the 2 analyses may be because
fewer women who reported feeling the effects of alcohol
quickly drank throughout pregnancy.15 A higher proportion
of mothers who felt the effects of alcohol normally in those
exposure groups may have masked the association in the
unstratified analysis.
ThePAEgroupwithbinge-levelalcoholconsumptioncom-
prised 50% to 70% of mothers with infrequent or single-
binge exposures, while in 20% to 30% of mothers, the binge
exposure occurred weekly or more often. This heterogeneity
may explain why we did not see a strong association between
binge-level PAE and craniofacial shape.
Facial abnormalities have previously been described in
children with PAE who do not meet diagnostic criteria for
FAS. Suttie et al5 analyzed 69 children whose mothers con-
sumed up to 13 standard drinks (14 g of AA) per week or
drank at binge levels and found that 28 children showed
patterns of facial anomalies similar to those seen in FAS or
partial FAS. These anomalies were also associated with
cognitive impairments. In their group comparisons, those
authors noted an elevation of the lower portion of the nose
in those with FAS, as well as smoothing of the philtrum,

 reduced palpebral fissure length, midfacial hypoplasia, and
retrognathia. The only previous study to examine low levels
of PAE found that 66% of 79 newborns in the exposure group
had some facial abnormality.25 However, observed abnor-
malities were not objectively defined and assessed by
unblinded observers. Moreover, the weekly mean intake of
alcohol per trimester was reported retrospectively, and it is
not possible to know if there were spikes in consumption at
particular time points, including the first trimester and the
period before recognition of pregnancy. Our study has exam-
ined the association of low levels of PAE using a more rigor-
ous assessment of both face shape and alcohol consumption.
We show that certain aspects of the phenotype (upturning of
the nasal tip and midfacial hypoplasia) can be detected even
when the maximum number of standard drinks (10 g of AA)
did not exceed 7 per week and 2 per occasion. We did not
observe the classic diagnostic features for FAS of smooth
philtrum, reduced palpebral fissure length, and thin vermil-
lion of the upper lip; it is likely that these features emerge
only at higher levels of exposure.
During embryogenesis, facial bone and cartilage are de-
rived from the cranial neural crest. Sizing and positioning of
facial elements begins 17 to 18 days after fertilization and be-
fore most pregnancies are recognized.26 Evidence from mouse
studiesshowsthatexposuretoethanolaffectsallstagesofneu-
ral crest development, resulting in variation in craniofacial ap-
pearance,dependingonthegestationaltimingofexposure.For
example, alcohol exposure at gestational day 7 (the 15th-17th
day in human development27) leads to severe midfacial hy-
poplasia,anelongatedupperlip,andadeficientphiltrum,while
exposure at day 8.5 causes mild midfacial hypoplasia, a short-
ened upper lip, and a preserved philtrum.28 We observed a
similar facial phenotype to that seen in animal models, par-
ticularly after first-trimester moderate PAE. Although it was
not possible to localize the timing of exposure as precisely as
in these animal studies, our findings confirm an association
between moderate PAE and facial shape in the first trimester
in humans, which is convergent with the animal evidence.
Even in children of mothers who drink heavily, facial
abnormalities associated with PAE are highly variable,5
which may reflect variation in the timing of exposure in the
first trimester or unmeasured risk factors. For example,
genetic variants in maternal and fetal alcohol metabolism
have been shown to influence the level of alcohol and/or its
toxic metabolites experienced by the fetus. Mendelian ran-
domization studies using the Avon Longitudinal Study of
Parents and Children predicted different patterns of PAE
and variable outcomes in offspring depending on several
variants in the alcohol dehydrogenase gene in the mother or
child (eg, ADH1B [OMIM 103720], predictive of reduced
alcohol consumption and associated with higher academic
achievement in offspring).29,30 Furthermore, regarding the
direct role of genes involved in alcohol metabolism in modi-
fying risk, evidence from laboratory studies using ethanol-
sensitive and ethanol-resistant chickens, mice, and zebra
fish provides insight into the multifactorial genetics of
ethanol-mediated cell signaling disruption and neural crest
apoptosis.31
We observed that children of mothers who reported feel-
ingtheeffectsofalcoholquicklyorveryquicklyexhibitedlarger
craniofacial differences in most exposure groups. We hypoth-
esize that this rate of feeling the effects of alcohol reflects ge-
netically determined variation in alcohol metabolism. The rate
offeelingtheeffectsofalcoholmayultimatelybeclinicallyuse-
ful to differentiate individuals with a greater susceptibility to
the effects of alcohol, conferring increased fetal vulnerabil-
ity, and may in part explain the heterogeneity of outcomes in
alcohol-exposed pregnancies and in FASD.
Craniofacial development closely corresponds to brain
induction and expansion, and, as such, characteristic facial
differences have been linked to brain abnormalities and
cognitive outcome in FASD.31 Correlative face-brain pheno-
types have been described in human and animal studies,
suggesting that the type and severity of brain abnormality
may be predicted in part by hypoplasia of the midface,28,32
and that the classic facial features of FASD (short palpebral
fissure, smooth philtrum, and thin upper lip) may assist in
identifying children at risk of developing neurobehavioral
deficits.5 Given that cognitive outcomes for the children in
our study have not yet been examined in this context, it is
as yet unknown if the craniofacial differences found are of
diagnostic or predictive value.
Strengths and Limitations
This study is a well-described cohort of mother-child dyads
with detailed PAE data and classification not available in many
other studies. The method of craniofacial phenotypic analy-
sis used in this study is the most objective and sensitive avail-
able, to our knowledge. Although the magnitude of the asso-
ciation was variable, we observed very similar anatomical
differences using almost every PAE categorization, which es-
sentially constitutes several replications of the findings and
demonstrates their robustness. A link between these facial
changes and brain structure and functioning remains to be in-
vestigated; in the meantime, we provide additional evidence
for an association between alcohol consumption and the de-
veloping fetus.
We did not observe the auricular anomalies previously
documented with low-level PAE in other studies.4 Owing to
the geometry of the multiple cameras used for imaging and the
anatomy of the ear, it was not possible to capture high-
quality images of the ear, and the analysis may have been ob-
scured by photographic noise in this region.
We postulate that the rate of feeling the effects of alcohol
is a proxy for metabolic factors influencing PAE and its asso-
ciation with facial shape, but have no direct measure such as
blood alcohol concentration or alcohol elimination rates to ex-
amine. Investigation of maternal and/or child allelic differ-
ences(genotypes)atspecificgenesassociatedwithalcoholme-
tabolism or alcohol use behavior is under way.
Conclusions
The results of this study suggest that even low levels of alco-
hol consumption can influence craniofacial development of

 the fetus and confirm that the first trimester is a critical pe-
riod. We observed aspects of a craniofacial phenotype with
almost any level of PAE, something previously only docu-
mented following a high level of long-term alcohol exposure.
Although the clinical significance of our findings is yet to be
determined, these findings support the conclusion that, for
women who are, or may become pregnant, avoiding alcohol
is the safest option.
