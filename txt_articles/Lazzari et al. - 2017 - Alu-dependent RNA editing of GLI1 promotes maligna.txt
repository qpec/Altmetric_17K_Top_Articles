Despite novel therapies, relapse of multiple myeloma (MM) is virtually inevitable. Amplifi-
cation of chromosome 1q, which harbors the inflammation-responsive RNA editase adeno-
sine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR)1 gene, occurs in 30–50% of MM patients and
portends a poor prognosis. Since adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing has recently emerged as
a driver of cancer progression, genomic amplification combined with inflammatory cytokine
activation of ADAR1 could stimulate MM progression and therapeutic resistance. Here, we
report that high ADAR1 RNA expression correlates with reduced patient survival rates in the
MMRF CoMMpass data set. Expression of wild-type, but not mutant, ADAR1 enhances Alu-
dependent editing and transcriptional activity of GLI1, a Hedgehog (Hh) pathway transcrip-
tional activator and self-renewal agonist, and promotes immunomodulatory drug resistance
in vitro. Finally, ADAR1 knockdown reduces regeneration of high-risk MM in serially trans-
plantable patient-derived xenografts. These data demonstrate that ADAR1 promotes malig-
nant regeneration of MM and if selectively inhibited may obviate progression and relapse.

ultiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma-cell neoplasm that
represents the second most common blood cancer in
the United States. High-risk forms of this disease have
been associated with amplifications at chromosome 1q21, which
occurs in over 30% of MM patients and is associated with poor
clinical outcomes1,2. Notably, the inflammation-responsive RNA
editase gene adenosine deaminase acting on RNA-1 (ADAR1) as
well as interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) localize to this unique

 chromosome region. ADAR1 edits adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I)
nucleotides, primarily within double-stranded (ds) RNA loops
formed by primate-specific Alu repeat sequences3. Although
ADAR1 p150 is expressed in response to inflammatory cytokine
signaling,
ADAR1
p110
is
constitutively
expressed4.
Pro-
inflammatory cytokine signals derived from the bone marrow
(BM) microenvironment have a key role in MM progression and
have been correlated with symptom severity and clonal evolu-
tion5. Moreover, induction of vital microenvironment-responsive
stem cell self-renewal pathways, such as NOTCH16, promotes
progression of MM. Interestingly, widespread deregulation of
inflammation-responsive epitranscriptomic events also contribute
to cancer stem cell (CSC) generation and maintenance, which
governs cancer progression and drug resistance7,8. In addition to
recurrent DNA mutations and epigenetic deregulation9, RNA
editing mediated by cytokine-responsive ADAR1 has emerged as
a vital contributor to transcriptome remodeling leading to cancer
relapse and progression7,10–12, however the contribution of pro-
inflammatory signaling leading to ADAR1-dependent RNA
editing in MM pathogenesis has not been previously explored.
To address this, here we performed gene expression analysis
in a cohort of primary samples with 1q amplification from the
Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF) CoMMpass
study, coupled with sensitive RNA editing analyses in high-risk
primary patient samples that establish robust in vivo disease
models and in the setting of acquired drug resistance in vitro.
Analyses
revealed
widespread
RNA
editing
activation
in
high-risk MM patients with poor overall and progression-free
survival, and robust induction of ADAR1 expression and
activity in the setting of acquired immunomodulatory drug
(IMiD) resistance. In contrast to ADAR1 shRNA knockdown
and overexpression of an editase defective ADAR1 mutant,
wild-type ADAR1 expression enhances Alu-dependent editing
and transcriptional activity of GLI1, a Hedgehog (Hh) pathway
transcriptional
activator
and
self-renewal
agonist,
and
promotes lenalidomide resistance in vitro. Finally, lentiviral
shRNA ADAR1 knockdown reduces regeneration of high-risk
MM in humanized serial transplantation mouse models. Thus,
aberrant RNA editing represents a compelling prognostic and
therapeutic target that may be exploited to obviate drug resis-
tance in patients with MM and other therapeutically recalci-
trant human malignancies.
Results
High ADAR1 expression in multiple myeloma predicts out-
comes. Approximately one-third of MM patients harbor ampli-
fication of chromosome 1q211,2, which contains ADAR1 and IL-
6R loci (Fig. 1a) and is associated with a poor prognosis13.
Although ADAR1 activation promotes progression in a broad
array of malignancies3,10,14, its role in MM pathogenesis has not
been explored. To investigate if ADAR1 has a role in MM pro-
gression and relapse, we analyzed the MMRF CoMMpass data-
base15,16. In 1q-amplified patients, ADAR1 levels were higher
than in non-1q-amplified MM patients with the highest levels in
1q-amplified, stage III patients (Fig. 1b). In contrast to genes such
as IL-6ST and ADAR2 that reside on other chromosomes, IL-6R
transcripts were elevated in 1q-amplified stage I MM patients but
showed no change with advancing stage (Fig. 1c; Supplementary
Fig. 1a, b). Isoform-specific analyses revealed that both ADAR1
p150 and p110 were upregulated in 1q-amplified patient samples
(Fig. 1d; Supplementary Fig. 1c) and in advanced-stage MM
(Table 1; Fig. 1e; Supplementary Fig. 1d). Of particular prognostic
relevance, a subset of samples expressing the highest levels of
ADAR1
(n = 159)
had
significantly
lower
overall
and
progression-free survival rates than the low ADAR1 cohort (n =
162) (Fig. 1f, g; Supplementary Fig. 1e, f). Thus, in MM patients,
1q21 amplification promotes ADAR1 overexpression, and during
cancer progression, as shown in other malignancies, inflamma-
tory cytokine signaling may promote ADAR1 expression leading
to poorer clinical outcomes7,11.
ADAR1-dependent RNA editing of GLI1 typifies high-risk
myeloma. Deregulation of ADAR1 has been linked to malignant
reprogramming of progenitors into self-renewing cancer stem
cells that promote progression and relapse11,12. Thus, we
employed RNA editing site-specific quantitative real time PCR
(RESSq-PCR)17 to detect A-to-I editing, which is subsequently

 pathway negative regulator, SUFU24 (Fig. 2a). In a Vienna
software-based prediction analysis of GLI1 pre-mRNA structure,
the ADAR1 edited site in exon 12 was detected in a dsRNA
hairpin adjacent to a larger dsRNA structure formed by inverted
AluY and AluSx, thereby altering the exonic hairpin (Fig. 2b;
Supplementary Fig. 2a) and underscoring the importance of
primate-specific secondary RNA structure for ADAR-mediated
RNA editing3,25. Notably, GLI1 transcript editing rates were
significantly higher in relapsed MM and PCL than age-matched
controls (Fig. 2c, d), and correlated with ADAR1 expression levels
(Fig. 2e). Analysis of a larger RNA-sequencing CoMMpass data
set showed increased A-to-G editing of GLI1 transcripts in 1q-
amplified compared with non-1q-amplified MM samples (Sup-
plementary Fig. 2b). Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) of
CoMMpass data revealed that 1q-amplified samples were sig-
nificantly enriched in cancer and stem cell pluripotency22 path-
ways, along with cell–cell adhesion26 and drug metabolism27
genes (Fig. 2f; Supplementary Fig. 2c). Among the KEGG-
annotated pathways regulating stem cell pluripotency and path-
ways in cancer, several stem cell regulatory transcripts modulated
by ADAR111, including AXIN2, MAPK3, and FGFR3 (Fig. 2g),
were enriched. Moreover, there was significant Hh pathway
enrichment (NES = 2.11, false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.0001) in
high ADAR1 (n = 177) compared to low ADAR1 (n = 152)
patients, consistent with ADAR1-associated Hh pathway mod-
ulation (Fig. 2h). In addition, IL-6 signaling and JAK/STAT sig-
naling were enriched in the high ADAR1 group, suggesting that
inflammatory cytokine signaling may further enhance ADAR1
expression in high-risk MM (Supplementary Fig. 2d, e).
To determine whether knockdown of ADAR1 could effectively
reduce GLI1 editing in ADAR1-enriched cells, we lentivirally
transduced human H929 myeloma cells, which harbor 4 copies of
1q21, with shRNA targeting ADAR1 (lenti-shADAR1). Compared
to control shRNA-transduced cells, lenti-shADAR1 transduced
cells displayed a 40% reduction in total ADAR1 expression and a
corresponding 35% reduction in GLI1 transcript editing rates
(Fig. 2i). To confirm the causal relationship between ADAR1
activity and GLI1 editing, we performed lentiviral transduction of
CD34+ cells with ADAR1-wild-type p150 (WT), an editase
defective ADAR (mutant ADAR1E912A), or a control vector,
followed by RESSq-PCR analysis. In contrast to ADAR1 mutant
(ADAR1E912A) or vector control, GLI1 transcript editing sig-
nificantly increased following lentiviral ADAR1-WT transduction
(Fig. 2j). We then evaluated ADAR1-dependent editing of GLI1 in
co-transfection experiments in HEK293T cells, which express low
levels of endogenous ADAR1 (non-1q-amplified) and GLI1. Co-
transfection of ADAR1-WT and GLI1 into HEK293T cells induced
robust GLI1 transcript editing (Fig. 2k). Conversely, transfection of
HEK293T cells with GLI1 and ADAR1 mutant (ADAR1E912A) did
not induce GLI1 editing, consistent with the need for intact
ADAR1 RNA editase activity (Fig. 2k; Supplementary Fig. 2f).
Furthermore, edited GLI1 (GLI1R701G) induced the GLI1-Luc
promoter reporter activity significantly more than the GLI1 WT
construct
(Fig.
2l),
consistent
with
Hh
signaling
pathway
activation observed in high ADAR1-expressing MM samples.
To further explore ADAR1-driven RNA editing events, we
performed RESSq-PCR analysis on other cancer-associated loci,
including the DNA cytidine deaminase APOBEC3D, antizyme
inhibitor 1 (AZIN1), and murine double minute 2 E3 ubiquitin
protein ligase (MDM2, Supplementary Fig. 2g–j). Consistent with
previous findings in leukemia progression11, APOBEC3D editing was
significantly increased in late-stage MM patients, whereas AZIN1
and MDM2 loci showed heterogeneous editing levels. These data
highlight the cell-type and context specific effects of ADAR1 editing.
ADAR1 silencing reduces engraftment of myeloma in vivo.
Considering that increased ADAR1 expression was shown to
enhance cancer stem cell generation in leukemia11,12, we analyzed
the serial transplantation potential of high-risk MM in RAG2
−/−γc−/−mice, as a gold standard in vivo cancer stem cell self-
renewal assay28,29, as well as the plasmacytoma-forming capacity
of ADAR1-enriched MM samples (Fig. 3a; Supplementary
Fig. 3a). Bioluminescent imaging demonstrated that lentiviral
luciferase-expressing MM cells homed to the BM and spleen (SP)
(Fig. 3b). Consistent with maintenance of malignant plasma-cell
clones in vivo, patient-specific light chains were detected in the
serum of the transplanted mice, within 7 to 21 weeks after
transplantation (Fig. 3c). Robust engraftment of MM patient-
derived cells was observed by FACS analysis in all hematopoietic
tissues (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Specifically, CD138+/CD319+
cells30 were detected in the BM, SP, peripheral blood (PB), and
liver (L, initial site of transplantation) of RAG2−/−γc−/−mice.
Notably, MM9-engrafted mice developed plasmacytomas (PC)
(Supplementary Fig. 3b). Consistent with previous reports31,
FACS analysis revealed that MM cells were CD38high and
CD45dim (Fig. 3d; Supplementary Fig. 3c, d). In primagraft
models, Alu repeat qPCR32 detection of human-specific RNA
confirmed the high rate of primary engraftment of human
malignant plasma cells (Supplementary Fig. 3e, f). Moreover, high
ADAR1 expression and Alu-dependent GLI1 RNA editing were
also maintained in vivo (Supplementary Fig. 3e–h). Furthermore,
this primagraft model propagated MM in serially transplanted

 MM cells. These data are consistent with ADAR1’s role in
malignant self-renewal11,12, and support a vital functional role for
ADAR1 activity in malignant regeneration of MM.
Activation of ADAR1 in myeloma cell lines promotes drug
resistance. To determine if inflammatory cytokine signaling
contributes to ADAR1 activation in MM, as reported in other
contexts12,33, we treated the 1q-amplified human myeloma cell
line H929 with increasing concentrations of IL-6 (0–10 ng/ml)
in vitro. We observed increased ADAR1 protein accumulation
and a significant increase in GLI1 RNA editing rates (Fig. 4a, b;
Supplementary Fig. 4a–d). These results highlight the importance
of inflammatory signaling pathways in amplification of malignant
RNA editing.
Resistance to IMiDs, such as lenalidomide which disrupts
cytokine-responsive pathways, is associated with MM progression.
Hypothesizing that lenalidomide could modulate ADAR1 expres-
sion and activity, we generated lenalidomide-resistant H929
myeloma cell lines34. Continuous lenalidomide exposure signifi-
cantly increased ADAR1 expression (Fig. 4c), whereas IRF4 levels
were reduced (Supplementary Fig. 4e). In contrast to ADAR1,
ADAR2 expression was downregulated (Supplementary Fig. 4f).
Moreover, the inflammatory cytokine-responsive ADAR1 p150
isoform was significantly upregulated in lenalidomide-resistant
cells (Fig. 4d). In addition, lenalidomide-resistant H929 cells show-
ed increased ADAR1 protein levels (Fig. 4e; Supplementary
Fig. 4m). Although short-term (24–48 h) IMiD exposure resulted
in modest, dose-dependent ADAR1 transcriptional activation,
ADAR1 protein levels increased at 48 h (Supplementary Fig. 4n, o).
In keeping with increased ADAR1 activation, lenalidomide-
resistant cells harbored significantly increased GLI1 editing (Fig. 4f).
Together, either IL-6 exposure or continuous lenalidomide treat-
ment enhanced A-to-I editing of GLI1 as well as other cancer-
associated associated transcripts, including APOBEC3D, AZIN1,
and MDM2 (Supplementary Fig. 4d, g). In keeping with ADAR1’s
role in self-renewal11, lenalidomide-resistant H929 cells displayed
increased replating capacity (Fig. 4g) commensurate with GLI1
transcript editing (Fig. 4h). Following lentiviral shRNA-mediated
ADAR1 silencing (Supplementary Fig. 4h, i), GLI1 transcript
editing (Fig. 4i) and self-renewal (Fig. 4j) were significantly red-
uced. Similar effects were observed with lentiviral shRNA knock-
down of GLI1 (Supplementary Fig. 4j–l), thereby supporting a role
for ADAR1-dependent RNA editing of GLI1 in IMiD resistance.
Discussion
Seminal studies demonstrate that MM is typified by widespread
genetic heterogeneity and subclonal diversity as well as Hh
pathway activation that contribute to therapeutic resistance18,35,36.
Compared with ADAR224,37, ADAR1 is the most abundantly
expressed and active RNA editase in MM, consistent with
potentiation of malignant regeneration by ADAR1. In MM, here
we demonstrate that malignant regenerative capacity is associated
with ADAR1-mediated recoding of the self-renewal agonist GLI1,
a pathway which has therapeutic potential in cancer while sparing
normal stem cell maintenance23,38. Although the Hh signaling
pathway has been associated with cancer stem cell generation,
and both the CD138+19,20 and CD138–18 cell populations secrete
Hh ligands that activate autocrine signaling in MM, we have
identified a primate-specific mechanism of Hh pathway activation
in MM through enhanced transcriptional activation of GLI1
following
Alu-dependent
ADAR1-mediated
RNA
editing.
Importantly, ADAR1-dependent RNA recoding of GLI1 and
regeneration of MM cells harboring 1q21 amplification could be
reversed through genetic knockdown of ADAR1. Overall, these
findings demonstrate that both genetic (1q21 amplification) and
microenvironmental (inflammatory cytokines, IMiDs) factors
modulate A-to-I editing activity, which drives GLI1-dependent
malignant regeneration in MM (Fig. 4k). Thus, ADAR1 activation
represents both a vital prognostic biomarker and therapeutic
vulnerability in MM.
Methods
CoMMpass study data analysis. Gene expression data in FPKM were obtained
from the CoMMpass RNA-Seq data sets (see “Data Availability”). In this study,
ADAR1, IL6R, IL6ST, and ADAR2 RNA-Seq data from CD138-purified cells was
included (n = 529; 1q n = 100; no 1q = 429; IA8 data release); patients were further
stratified among the groups 1q amplification versus no 1q according to the
International Staging System39, when available (1q stage I n = 29, stage II n = 39,
stage III n = 32; no 1q stage I n = 146, stage II n = 150, stage III n = 133). ADAR1
isoforms expression analyses were evaluated in a smaller subset of samples (1q n =
39; stage I = 14; stage II n = 17, stage III n = 8; no 1q n = 47, stage I n = 20, stage II
n = 14, stage III n = 13; IA7 data release).
Primary sample processing. MM patient samples and normal age-matched (n = 3,
mean age = 60.6 ± 16.8 years old) BM samples were obtained from consenting
patients in accordance with Institutional Review Board approved protocols at
University of California-San Diego (UCSD or the Princess Margaret Hospital
(Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Peripheral blood (PB) or BM samples were processed
by Ficoll density centrifugation in a SepMate conical tube (StemCell Technologies).
Viable total mononuclear cells (MNC) were collected for further analyses and
stored in liquid nitrogen.
RNA editing site-specific quantitative PCR. RESSq-PCR assay primer design17
was carried out for specific cancer and stem cell-associated loci. For these assays,
allele-specific primers were designed using Primer1, generating two outer and two
inner primers for each editing site with melting temperatures ranging from 60 to
68 °C. The forward (FW) outer and reverse (REV) outer primers flank the editing site
and can be used for Sanger sequencing validation of each editing site, and also as a
qPCR positive control to ensure that the editing region is detectable in cDNA. The

 3′ ends of the FW inner and REV inner primers match either the WT A or edited
G nucleotide, and include an additional mismatch two nucleotides upstream of the
3′ primer end to enhance allelic discrimination. Relative RNA editing rates (Relative
Edit/WT RNA) were calculated using the following calculation: 2−(Ct Edit − Ct WT).
Gene set enrichment analyses and double strand structure prediction. Gene
expression values (FPKM) downloaded from the MMRF CoMMpass study web
portal (https://research.themmrf.org and study accession phs000748.v4.p3) were
input into the GSEA software11, and through the MMRF GSEA algorithm with
NCI-provided gene sets. Enriched gene sets were derived from the analysis with a
FDR < 10% and p value < 0.05.
GLI1 editing analysis was performed on whole transcriptome data publicly
available from the CoMMpass study. A total of 97 samples were included. RNA-seq
raw reads were aligned to reference genome GRCh37. Aligned reads were
processed with SAMTools, and editing (A or G SNV) was evaluated in GLI117.
Putative A-to-G events with equal or higher than 2 reads were included in the final
analysis (n = 14/17 with/without 1q21 amplifications, respectively). Consistent low
coverage was observed among all samples for the site. Ratio of G over total reads is
displayed in results. Secondary structure of GLI1 transcript were predicted by
Vienna RNA software40.
Lentiviral transduction. Prior to transplant (primary MNCs) or in vitro experi-
ments, cells were plated in U-bottom 96-well plate and incubated with lentivirus
for 48 h in regular media (H929) or StemPro (ThermoFisher) complete media
(primary MNCs). Lentiviral GFP-luciferase (GLF) encoding vector was used at 100
Multiplicity of Infection (MOI); lentiviral shGLI1 (Genecopoeia)/shADAR112
(Thermofisher) or relative shCtrl backbone controls were used at 50–100 MOI. An
editase-deficient ADAR1 mutant (ADAR1E912A)11 or ADAR1-WT lentiviral vec-
tors in pCDH-EF1-T2a-GFP backbone were used in primary cells at MOI = 100.
Transient GLI1 and ADAR1 overexpression. HEK293T cells were plated in 12-
well plates (0.25 × 106 cells per well) 24 h prior transfection. pCDH backbone or
pCDH-GLI1 plasmids were used for transient transcript overexpression, co-
transfected with pDEST ADAR1-WT or mutant11 ADAR1E912A. 1 μg of total
plasmid DNA was used for each condition and cells were collected 48 h post-
transfection for further analyses.
Dual reporter assays. HEK293T cells were plated in 96-well plates (0.3 × 105 cells
per well) 24 h prior to transfection with Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies).
pCDH backbone/GLI1 WT/GLI1R701G plasmids were co-transfected with a dual
GLI reporter system (6X-GLI1-Luciferase reporter and Renilla reporter, 1:1 ratio)
for transient transcript overexpression. Cells were collected 48 h post-transfection
for further analyses of promoter activation by luminescence detection.
Intrahepatic inoculation of tumor cells and tissue collection. All animal studies
were performed in accordance with UCSD and NIH-equivalent ethical guidelines
and were approved by the university institutional animal care and use committee
(IACUC). Newborn (1–3 days) Balb/c Rag2−/−γc−/− mice (sample size depending
on litter survival rates) were intrahepatically injected with a 30 gauge Hamilton
syringe (Hamilton Company). Each animal received 1–2 × 106 MNCs isolated from
primary samples. Animals were weaned at 3 weeks of age and monitored regularly
by health status assessment; in vivo bioluminescence imaging (IVIS 200) and
peripheral blood screening were regularly performed until signs of disease were
observed, including significant loss of weight, limited mobility and presence of
palpable tumors. Mice were killed by CO2 inhalation. PB was collected by cardiac
puncture immediately after sacrifice. Bones, SP, L, and PC were collected in ice cold
HBSS containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS). For serial transplantation assays,
hematopoietic tissues and PC were processed into single-cell suspensions, enriched
for human cells using a mouse cell depletion kit (Miltenyi), and equal proportions
of viable bone marrow and PC-derived human cells were mixed for transplantation
into serial transplant recipient mice.
Western blot and nanoproteomic analysis. A total of 5–10 × 106 cells were
harvested in RIPA buffer for total protein extraction. Overall, 10–20 μg of each
sample were loaded onto 10% polyacrylamide gels for gel electrophoresis. Primary
antibodies (polyclonal anti-ADAR1 ab88574 1:500, monoclonal anti-ADAR1
ab126745, 1:1000, and anti-actin ab8227, 1:1000, Abcam) were prepared in
blocking buffer. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary anti-
bodies, followed by secondary antibody incubation (anti-rabbit HRP or anti-mouse
HRP, 1:5000, Cell Signaling Technology; or anti-chicken HRP, 1:5000, Abcam) in
blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were developed using enhanced
chemiluminescence (Femto Detection kit, Promega) on a Chemidoc digital ima-
ging machine. Representative images out of three independent Western blots are
shown in main and supplementary figures, with uncropped images of key blots
provided in Supplementary Fig. 5. Nanofluidic experiments were performed with
the Nanopro 1000 instrument (Cell Biosciences). ADAR1 was detected using an
ADAR1-specific antibody (ab168809, 1:500 Abcam). A β2-microglubulin-specific
antibody (β2M; 1:500 Upstate) was used to normalize the amount of loaded
protein.
