 independent cohorts (41 and 79 patients) were retrospectively identified from the Comprehensive 
Longitudinal Investigation of Multiple Sclerosis at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
Expression of miRNA was determined by locked nucleic acid–based quantitative real-time 
polymerase chain reaction. Spearman correlation coefficients were used to test the association 
between miRNA and brain lesions (T2 hyperintense lesion volume [T2LV]), the ratio of T1 
hypointense lesion volume [T1LV] to T2LV [T1:T2]), brain atrophy (whole brain and gray 
matter), and cervical spinal cord lesions (T2LV) and atrophy. The study was conducted from 
December 2013 to April 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—miRNA expression.
RESULTS—Of the 120 patients included in the study, cohort 1 included 41 participants (7 
[17.1%] men), with mean (SD) age of 47.7 (9.5) years; cohort 2 had 79 participants (26 [32.9%] 
men) with a mean (SD) age of 43.0 (7.5) years. Associations between miRNAs and MRIs were 
both protective and pathogenic. Regarding miRNA signatures, a topographic specificity differed 
for the brain vs the spinal cord, and the signature differed between T2LV and atrophy/destructive 
measures. Four miRNAs showed similar significant protective correlations with T1:T2 in both 
cohorts, with the highest for hsa.miR.143.3p (cohort 1: Spearman correlation coefficient rs = 
−0.452, P = .003; cohort 2: rs = −0.225, P = .046); the others included hsa.miR.142.5p (cohort 1: rs 
= −0.424, P = .006; cohort 2: rs = −0.226, P = .045), hsa.miR.181c.3p (cohort 1: rs = −0.383, P = .
01; cohort 2: rs = −0.222, P = .049), and hsa.miR.181c.5p (cohort 1: rs = −0.433, P = .005; cohort 
2: rs = −0.231, P = .04). In the 2 cohorts, hsa.miR.486.5p (cohort 1: rs = 0.348, P = .03; cohort 2: rs 
= 0.254, P = .02) and hsa.miR.92a.3p (cohort 1: rs = 0.392, P = .01; cohort 2: rs = 0.222, P = .049) 
showed similar significant pathogenic correlations with T1:T2; hsa.miR.375 (cohort 1: rs = 
−0.345, P = .03; cohort 2: rs = −0.257, P = .022) and hsa.miR.629.5p (cohort 1: rs = −0.350, P = .
03; cohort 2: rs = −0.269, P = .02) showed significant pathogenic correlations with brain atrophy. 
Although we found several miRNAs associated with MRI outcomes, none of these associations 
remained significant when correcting for multiple comparisons, suggesting that further validation 
of our findings is needed.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Serum miRNAs may serve as MS biomarkers for 
monitoring disease progression and act as surrogate markers to identify underlying disease 
processes.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) involves autoimmune-related inflammatory demyelination of the 
central nervous system white matter and gray matter (GM).1 The disease may transect axons 
and cause brain and spinal cord neuronal loss and atrophy.2 Magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) is a standard tool for the diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of MS.3–5 Recent MRI 
technology allows visualization of tissue atrophy6,7 and GM involvement7,8 beyond the 
traditional focal white matter lesion assessments.9
Among lesion measures, T2 hyperintense areas are histologically nonspecific but can 
estimate the burden of overt demyelinating foci.9 Persisting T1 hypointense lesions (black 
holes) specifically indicate irreversible tissue destruction.10 The total burden of such lesions 
and the proportion of T2 lesions showing T1 hypointensity11 provide a better indication of 
physical disability,12 quality of life,13 and unemployment.14

 Quantification of atrophy with MRI can estimate axonal loss, neuronal loss, and 
neurodegenerative changes, which complement lesion measurements.15,16 Brain atrophy, 
particularly of GM, links to physical disability and cognitive impairment after adjusting for 
the effect of lesions.17,18 Spinal cord involvement is associated with disability19 and 
provides unique information vs brain MRI.20,21
MicroRNAs (miRNAs)are small, noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression by binding 
to complementary sequences in untranslated messenger RNA (mRNA) regions, resulting in 
translational repression or mRNA degradation.22–24 Dysregulated miRNA expression links 
to a range of immunologic and other diseases.25–27 Due to their detectability and stability in 
plasma, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid25,27,28 as well as the development of sensitive 
methods for their detection and quantification,29 miRNAs are attractive biomarkers.
Previous studies showed changes in miRNA expression in brain tissue, serum and plasma, 
and immune cells from patients with MS and in experimental autoimmune 
encephalomyelitis.30–33 Previous studies have also shown associations between MS 
disability or disease progression and the expression of miRNAs.34,35
Magnetic resonance imaging measures of lesions and atrophy aid in defining the 
pathobiology reflected by a candidate biomarker.36 Since miRNAs regulate several cellular 
pathways, we hypothesized that different miRNA expression patterns would show 
associations with specific MRI measures of cerebral and spinal cord involvement.
Methods
Participants
As part of the Comprehensive Longitudinal Investigation of Multiple Sclerosis cohort study 
of clinical, MRI, and blood phenotyping in more than 2000 patients at Brigham and 
Women’s Hospital,37 we retrospectively identified patients with (1) age 18 to 55 years, (2) 
MS diagnosis,38 (3) absence of other major medical disorders, and (4) no more than 30 days 
between serum and brain MRI acquisition (cohort 1) or both spine and brain MRI 
acquisition (cohort 2). Patients were evaluated by an MS specialist at the time of MRI for 
neurologic disability by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, an ordinal scale 
ranging from low (0) to high (10) disability.39 Two independent cohorts (eTable 1 in the 
Supplement) were tested and analyzed for miRNA-MRI associations. Cohort 1 had 41 
participants (7 [17.1%] men), with a mean (SD) age of 47.7 (9.5) years; cohort 2 had 79 
participants (26 [32.9%] men), with a mean (SD) age of 43.0 (7.5) years. The study was 
conducted from December 2013 to April 2016.
The study was approved by the Partners Health Care Human Research Committee. The 
participants provided written informed consent; there was no financial compensation.
Samples
Serum samples were collected in red-top Vacutainer tubes without additives, centrifuged at 
2000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate serum, and stored at −70°C until RNA extraction. 
Isolation of RNA was then performed (miRcury kit; Exiqon) and converted to

 complementary DNA using a synthesis kit (Exiqon). Prepared complementary DNA samples 
were stored at −20°C. Locked nucleic acid, green-based, real-time quantitative polymerase 
chain reaction Human Panel I and II (LNA-SYBR; Exiqon) containing 652 miRNAs and 
752 miR-NAs were used for profiling the first set and second sets, respectively. 
Normalization was performed using the mean miRNA expression of 10 miRNAS (hsa.let.7d.
3p, hsa.miR.103a.3p, hsa.miR.106a.5p, hsa.miR.126.3p, hsa.miR.15b.5p, hsa.miR.19a.3, 
hsa.miR.20a.5p, hsa.miR.30b.5p, hsa.miR.425.5p, and hsa.miR.92a.3p), with the best 
stability index determined by Norm Finder software. Normalized cycle quantification (Cq) 
was calculated as mean Cq – assay Cq.
MRI Acquisition
Patients were scanned on one of two 1.5T MRI units (Signa; GE Healthcare). For brain 
imaging, the sequences covered the whole head; were free of intersection gaps; and included 
(1) axial, T2-weighted, conventional spin-echo dual-echo (repetition time (TR)/echo time 1 
(TE1)/TE2, 3000/30/80 milliseconds; voxel size, 0.9375 × 0.9375 × 3 mm); (2) axial T1-
weighted spinecho (TR/TE, 467–733/20 milliseconds; voxel size, 0.9375 × 0.9375 × 3 mm); 
(3) (cohort 2 only) sagittal, 3-dimensional, magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo 
(TR/TE, 8.6/3.8 milliseconds; voxel size, 0.94 × 0.94 × 1.2 mm); and (4) axial T1-weighted 
spin-echo imaging, which was repeated 5 to 7 minutes after a 0.1-mmol/kg intravenous 
infusion of gadolinium. For the cervical spinal cord imaging (cohort 2), patients were 
scanned on the same MRI unit, including axial T2-weighted fast spin-echo covering the 
whole cervical spinal cord, with a voxel size of 0.35 × 0.35 × 3mm. The mean (SD) TR was 
3561 (431) milliseconds, and the TE was 103 (1.3) milliseconds. Thus, cohort 2 had a 3-
dimensional, high-resolution brain acquisition and a spinal cord image set in addition to 
conventional brain imaging that was obtained in both cohorts.
MRI Analysis
Lesion Measures—Whole-brain T1 hypointense (T1LV) and T2 hyperintense (T2LV) 
lesion volume (both cohorts) and whole cervical (C1 to C7) spinal cord T2LV (cohort 2) 
were expert traced using an edge-finding tool in Jim, version 7 software (Xinapse Systems 
Ltd, http://www.xinapse.com/). Brain T2 lesions required hyperintensity on both the early- 
and late-echo T2 images. Brain T1 hypointense lesions (black holes) were defined as 
containing some degree of visible hyperintensity on the T2 images but were free of 
gadolinium enhancement (to reduce the detection of benign and transient lesions).40 As an 
index of the destructive potential of the lesions, we calculated the intrapatient ratio of T1LV 
to T2LV (T1:T2) based on its unique and valuable role in previous studies.11,41,42
Brain Atrophy—For cohort 2, given the availability of a high-resolution image set, we 
used a fully automated algorithm to derive normalized whole-brain parenchymal (BPV) and 
GM(GMV) volumes(SIENAX, version 5.0; Analysis Group,http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk).14,43 
Given the ineffective contouring of the deep central and posterior foss a GM from the 
SIENAX output, we performed manual masking of the GMV maps to remove those regions 
to calculate the cortical GMV (cGMV). For cohort 1 (Figure 1), we relied on the dual-echo 
images to estimate brain atrophy using a fully automated pipeline (SPM, version 12; 
Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/). This derived brain

 parenchymal fraction (BPF) (a validated estimation of whole-brain atrophy6) normalized as 
the ratio of brain parenchymal tissue (GM plus white matter) volume divided by the 
intracranial volume.44 We also calculated the global cerebral GM fraction (GMF) in an 
analogous manner.
Spinal Cord Atrophy—In cohort 2, axial T2-weighted images of the cervical cord (C1-
C5) were applied to a validated active surface tool45 using the Jim, version 7 software 
package. Manual adjustments were made as necessary to capture the spinal cord contour. 
Spinal cord volume from C1 to C5 was normalized by dividing by the number of axial 
sections46 to generate the upper cervical spinal cord area (UCCA). Our group has previously 
shown that cord volumes derived from T2-weighted images are similar to those obtained 
from T1-weighted images.47
Reliability and Blinding—Analysis of MR images was performed by operators (F.K., 
R.C., S. Tauhid, S. Tummala, S.L.D., and G.K.) blinded to clinical and biomarker 
information. Five metrics required operator input (brain T2LV, brain T1LV, cGMV, UCCA, 
and spinal cord T2LV). Regarding brain T2LV, brain T1LV, and UCCA, our procedures and 
their high reliability have been well established in previously published studies.47,48 In the 
present data set, intrarater reliability was high as assessed from 5 randomly chosen cases. 
For spinal cord T2LV, the mean coefficient of variation was 3.53%; for cGMV, the mean 
coefficient of variation was 0.44%.
Statistical Analysis
Spearman correlation coefficients (rs) estimated the association between miRNA expression 
(normalized Cq) and MRI and disability (EDSS score). Spearman correlations were used so 
that participants with miRNA levels below detection limits (missing or undetected values) 
could contribute to the analysis. Undetected expression values were assigned a value lower 
than the smallest observed value from all participants. P Values were adjusted for multiple 
comparisons using the false discovery rate. The miRNA-MRI associations were observed as 
either pathogenic, shown by high miRNA expression associated with high MRI severity, or 
protective, shown by association with lower MRI-indicated severity. In the interpretation of 
the correlation coefficients, MRI-indicated severity was reflected in 2 possible directions 
depending on the metric: (1) for lesion severity (T2LV and T1:T2), a higher number 
represented increased disease severity, and (2) for atrophy measures (BPF, GMF, BPV, 
cGMV, and UCCA), a higher number represented lower disease severity (less atrophy). 
Demographic characteristics were compared using 2-sample, 2-tailed t tests for continuous 
variables and χ2 tests for dichotomous variables. Data analysis was performed from April 
2016 to June 2016. Statistical analysis was completed in R, version 3.0.2 (http://www.r-
project.org) and Stata/IC, version 14 (http://www.stata.com).
Results
Correlation Between MRI and Disability
The MRI measures of destructive pathology (T1:T2 ratio and atrophy), but not brain and 
spinal cord T2LV, showed significant associations with EDSS (eTable 2 in the Supplement).

 The strongest correlation was for atrophy of the brain (GMF: rs = −0.507; P < .001; BPV: rs 
= −0.470; P < .001) and spinal cord (UCCA: rs = −0.389; P < .001).
Correlation Between miRNAs and MRI
The 10 miRNAs showing the strongest MRI association in each cohort are provided in 
Tables 1 and 2 (eTable 3 and eTable 4 in the Supplement present all correlations). In cohort 
1, the miRNAs that demonstrated strong correlations were similar for BPF and GMF. 
However, the miRNAs associated with lesions (T2LV and T1:T2 ratio) were mostly different 
from those associated with atrophy, suggesting different pathologic processes underlying 
focal lesions (inflammatory demyelination) vs neurodegeneration (axonal and neuronal 
loss). Similar to those in cohort 1, miRNAs in cohort 2 that showed a strong correlation with 
whole-brain atrophy also indicated a strong correlation with cerebral GM atrophy. However, 
a different set of miRNAs correlated with spinal cord vs brain atrophy. In addition, only a 
small overlap was found between miRNAs associated with brain vs spinal cord T2LV. Thus, 
there was a topographic specificity in brain- vs spinal cord–related miRNAs. Although we 
found several miRNAs associated with MRI outcomes, none of these remained significant 
after false discovery rate correction.
Correlations Common Between miRNAs and MRI in Both Cohorts
Four miRNAs showed similar significant protective correlations with T1:T2 in both cohorts, 
with the highest for hsa.miR.143.3p (cohort 1: Spearman correlation coefficient rs = −0.452, 
P = .003; cohort 2: rs = −0.225, P = .046); the others included hsa.miR.142.5p (cohort 1: rs = 
−0.424, P = .006; cohort 2: rs = −0.226, P = .045), hsa.miR.181c.3p (cohort 1: rs = −0.383, P 
= .01; cohort 2: rs = −0.222, P = .049), and hsa.miR.181c.5p (cohort 1: rs = −0.433, P = .005; 
cohort 2: rs = −0.231, P = .04). In the 2 cohorts, hsa.miR.486.5p (cohort 1: rs = 0.348, P = .
03; cohort 2: rs = 0.254, P = .02) and hsa.miR.92a.3p (cohort 1: rs = 0.392, P = .01; cohort 2: 
rs = 0.222, P = .049) showed similar significant pathogenic correlations with T1:T2; 
hsa.miR.375 (cohort 1: rs = −0.345, P = .03; cohort 2: rs = −0.257, P = .022) and hsa.miR.
629.5p (cohort 1: rs = −0.350, P = .03; cohort 2: rs = −0.269, P = .02) showed significant 
pathogenic correlations with brain atrophy. Thus, a common set of miRNAs was as sociated 
with measures of destructive pathology/neurodegeneration in both cohorts. The miRNAs 
that were significantly correlated in the same direction with MRI are summarized in Table 3 
and Figure 2. Four miRNAs (hsa.miR.142.5p, hsa.miR.143.3p, hsa.miR.181c.3p, and 
hsa.miR.181c.5p) were significantly correlated (protective) with T1:T2 ratio in both cohorts, 
with hsa.miR.143.3p correlating the highest (cohort 1: rs = −0.452, P = .003; cohort 2: rs = 
−0.225, P = .046). Two miRNAs (hsa.miR.486.5p and hsa.miR.92a.3p) significantly 
correlated (pathogenic) with T1:T2 ratio in both cohorts. Two miRNAs (hsa.miR.375 and 
hsa.miR.629.5p) significantly correlated (pathogenic) with brain atrophy in both cohorts. 
Thus, a common set of miRNAs was associated with measures of destructive pathology/
neurodegeneration in both cohorts.
Correlations Between miRNAs and Disability
Several miRNAs showed significant associations with EDSS score in both cohorts (Tables 1 
and 2). Seven of these associations remained significant after false discovery rate correction 
(Table 1).

 Discussion
We evaluated the association between serum miRNA and MRI measures of disease severity 
in MS, including lesions and atrophy, in the brain and spinal cord. Several key findings 
emerged: both protective and pathogenic associations were found between miRNAs and 
MRI; a topographic specificity, different between the brain and spinal cord, was identified; a 
pathobiologic specificity was found with T2 lesions showing a different miRNA signature vs 
atrophy and destructive measures; and T2 lesions demonstrated the weakest link to both 
miRNA and disability.
MicroRNAs have been proposed as biomarkers relevant to diagnosis, stage of disease, and 
response to treatment in MS.33–35,53 Magnetic resonance imaging techniques have long 
contributed to the diagnosis and monitoring of the disease.3 Imaging advances have allowed 
measurement of heterogeneous pathologic processes, allowing clustering of patients based 
on these differences.15,56 To further understand the correlation between pathogenic and 
protective miRNAs and the relevance of their association with MRI in the present study, we 
performed an Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (https://targetexplorer.ingenuity.com/) to identify 
the most relevant experimentally observed gene targets of the miRNAs.
Among the identified miRNAs, reduced expression of hsa.miR.143.3p correlated with 
increased T1:T2 ratio as a protective association. Previous studies indicate that hsa.miR.
143.3p is inversely associated with brain tissue damage, with decreased levels in the serum 
in persons with Alzheimer disease, minimal cognitive impairment, and vascular dementia vs 
the levels in healthy individuals.50 Deregulated expression of hsa.miR.143 is present in 
synaptoneurosomes isolated from prion-infected mice at both asymptomatic and 
symptomatic stages of the disease.57 The expression of hsa.miR.143 in neuronal stem cells 
is increased following the administration of insulinlike growth factor-158 (known to support 
the proliferation and enhanced survival of neuronal stem cells).59 An analysis of the 
downstream cascade of hsa.miR.143 has exposed many potential targets, such as platelet-
derived growth factor receptor-α, which play a significant role in the differentiation of 
oligodendrocytes, as trocytes, and neuroprogenitors.60 Another target, mitogen-activated 
protein kinase, regulates differentiation of neuronal stem cells.61 Taken together, the above 
results suggest the potential role of hsa.miR.143.3p in neuroprotection and repair, consistent 
with the present findings.
Similarly, hsa.miR.142.5p, which also showed a protective correlation with T1:T2 ratio in 
our study, is known to be downregulated in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma from patients 
with Alzheimer disease.62 As predicted by pathway analysis, hsa.miR.142.5p targets nuclear 
factor erythroid-like 2 and plays a key role in regulating genes involved in responses to free 
radical production upon injury and inflammation.63
The pathogenic miRNA, hsa.miR.92a.3p, showed a pathogenic relationship with T1:T2 ratio 
in our study. This miRNA belongs to the miR17–92 cluster, which is overexpressed in B 
cells55 and plasma34 in patients with MS vs healthy individuals serving as controls. In mice, 
miR17–92 favors proinflammatory Th17 polarization.64 Furthermore, CD4 T-cell–specific

 ablation of the miR17–92 cluster mitigates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by 
inhibiting the effector function of Th17 cells.
Another pathogenic miRNA in our study with regard to T1:T2 ratio (hsa.miR.486.5p) 
primarily targets phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) and forkhead Box O1 
(FOXO1).65,66 Both PTEN and FOXO1 are involved in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. T-
cell receptor and cytokine signaling activate this pathway, which leads to Akt 
phosphorylation and inactivation of FOXO1, which is a factor critical for T-cell homeostasis, 
homing, and Treg induction. PTEN is a suppressor of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/
protein kinase B (P13K/Akt) pathway67,68; therefore, enhanced expression of hsa.miR.
486.5p may lead to downregulation of PTEN and FOXO1, followed by activation of the 
P13K/Akt pathway and T-cell dysfunction. The other pathogenic miRNA with regard to 
T1:T2 ratio in our study, hsa.miR.92a.3p, also targets PTEN69,70 and other proteins, 
including IKAROS family zinc finger 1 (IKZF1),71 which is a transcription factor that has 
been shown to regulate hematopoietic cell development. Studies indicate that IKZF1 
represses the expression of Tbet transcription factor, a regulator of Th1 cells. In addition, 
IKZF1 represses the B-cell production of IgG2c, an IgG whose levels are upregulated in 
autoimmune disorders.72,73 Therefore, one can speculate that hsa.miR.92a.3p plays a 
pathogenic role by repressing gene targets known to regulate immune cell activity and 
prevent inflammation.
miRNA hsa.miR.181c.5p showed a protective correlation with T1:T2 ratio in our study. This 
miRNA targets TRA, CD69, and AICDA—all known to mediate proinflammatory 
pathogenic effects by modulating T-cell activation or autoantibody production by B cells.
74–79 Therefore, a reduction in protective miRNA levels may enhance inflammatory 
responses by increased expression of its targets. Another target of hsa.miR.181c.5p includes 
matrix metallopeptidase 14 (MMP14),80 which is implicated in cell migration and 
infiltration. Loss of MMP14 in mice was shown to impair monocyte migration, 
transendothelial invasion, cytokine release, and infiltration of T cells into sites of 
inflammation.81 These findings suggest that the presence of MMP14 due to low levels of 
this protective miRNA may correlate with disease progression by allowing entry of immune 
cells into the central nervous system.
An important observation in this study was the topographic specificity of the relationships 
that we detected between miRNAs and MRI. Different sets of miRNAs were associated with 
spinal cord MRI measures of disease severity (lesions or atrophy) vs brain measures. This 
divergence is in line with previous laboratory and clinical studies showing that specific 
genetic susceptibility is associated with a predilection for spinal cord lesions82 and that 
different effector T-cell subsets induce predominantly spinal cord (Th1) or brain (Th17) 
parenchymal infiltration and inflammation.83 In further support of this concept, a study 
found no correlation between brain and spinal cord MRI involvement in MS.21 Other studies 
have shown the complementary information obtained by combining brain and spinal cord 
MRI to characterize disease severity.20,84
We observed a limited overlap between miRNAs associated with cerebral lesions (T2LV) vs 
those associated with tissue destruction (ie, atrophy [BPF, BPV, GMF, and cGMV] or severe

 lesions [T1:T2]). Such findings are consistent with the weak association that has been 
detected between T2LV and brain atrophy.15,56 These observations suggest a decoupling 
between focal inflammatory demyelination in white matter and diffuse cerebral 
neurodegeneration.15 A range of factors other than T2 lesions may be more important 
determinants of tissue loss, such as remyelination and repair capacity,85 meningeal 
inflammation,86 microglial proliferation,87 and toxins or oxidative stress.88
Regarding lesion measures, T2LV showed the weakest association with either disability or 
miRNA expression. This observation is consistent with the notion that T2 lesions are 
nonspecific for the nature and severity of tissue injury, but the development of lesional T1 
hypointensity9 has a higher clinical relevance. This would explain why a T1:T2 lesion index 
shows more utility than T2LV in tracking therapeutic effects and providing clinical relevance 
in MS.11,89
Strengths and Limitations
To our knowledge, this is the first study that includes 2 large, independent patient cohorts; a 
highly specific, locked nucleic acid–based, quantitative polymerase chain reaction platform 
for miRNA expression29; and quantitative MRI analysis that includes the brain and spinal 
cord. One of the limitations is the lack of traditional discovery and validation phases, that is, 
the patients in cohort 2 were different from those in cohort 1 in their treatment history and 
the miRNA panel. However, this difference might indicate better generalizability of our 
findings given their consistency despite these variations. Among the miRNAs showing a 
significant correlation with disability, several correlations remained significant after 
correcting for multiple comparisons. In contrast, none of the correlations with MRI 
remained significant following this correction. These limitations temper our conclusions and 
suggest the need for further validation of our findings in future studies. Some of the miRNAs 
that significantly correlated with disease severity measures in the present study have also 
been related to MS or experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (Table 3). However, 
these correlations do not necessarily represent causation, although the evidence described 
above suggests such a relationship. Circulating miRNAs could be a byproduct of routine 
microvesicle secretion and cell death or be actively secreted to contribute to intracellular 
communication.90
Conclusions
Further studies in larger MS cohorts, other neurodegenerative diseases, and healthy 
individuals serving as controls may indicate whether the miRNAs identified in this study are 
exclusive to MS or generalized. A study with longitudinal design, with serum samples drawn 
at disease onset, would allow the evaluation of the ability of miRNA expression to determine 
subsequent disease evolution.

 Key Points
Question
Are serum microRNAs associated with brain and spinal cord magnetic resonance 
imaging involvement in multiple sclerosis?
Findings
In this cross-sectional cohort study of 120 patients with multiple sclerosis, microRNA 
magnetic resonance imaging associations were both pathogenic and protective. A 
topographic specificity differed for the brain vs the spinal cord, and the microRNA 
signature differed between magnetic resonance imaging T2 lesions and atrophy measures.
Meaning
Serum microRNAs may serve as multiple sclerosis biomarkers for monitoring disease 
progression and act as surrogate markers to identify distinct underlying disease processes, 
such as inflammation vs tissue destruction.

 Figure 1. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Segmentation Procedure to Derive Brain Volume 
(Atrophy) Measures in Cohort 1
Native axial dual-echo proton density (A) and T2-weighted (B) images were applied to a 
fully automated statistical parametric mapping pipeline (version 12), resulting in an 
intracranial volume segmented into brain vs cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compartments used to 
derive brain parenchymal fraction (C) and gray vs white matter maps (D) used to derive 
global cerebral gray matter fraction. A patient with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis 
from cohort 1 is shown.

 Figure 2. MicroRNA (miRNA) Correlation With Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Measures 
of Disease Severity
miRNAs showed significant correlations with MRI measures of disease severity in both 
cohort 1 and cohort 2. BPF indicates whole-brain parenchymal fraction; BPV, whole-brain 
parenchymal volume; and T1:T2, ratio of T1 hypointense to T2 hyperintense lesion volume.
