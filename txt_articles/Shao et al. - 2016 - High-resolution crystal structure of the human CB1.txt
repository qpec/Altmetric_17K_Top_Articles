Abstract
The human cannabinoid G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) CB1 and CB2 mediate the 
functional responses to the endocannabinoids anandamide and 2-arachidonyl glycerol (2-AG), as 
well as the widely consumed plant (phyto)cannabinoid Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)1. The 
cannabinoid receptors have been the targets of intensive drug discovery efforts due to the 
therapeutic potential of modulators for controlling pain2, epilepsy3, obesity4, and other maladies. 
While much progress has recently been made in understanding the biophysical properties of 
GPCRs, investigations of the molecular mechanisms of the cannabinoids and their receptors have 
lacked high-resolution structural data. We used GPCR engineering and lipidic cubic phase (LCP) 
crystallization to determine the structure of the human CB1 receptor bound to the inhibitor 
taranabant at 2.6 Å resolution. CB1's extracellular surface, including the highly conserved 
membrane-proximal amino-terminal (N-terminal) region, is distinct from other lipid-activated 
GPCRs and forms a critical part of the ligand binding pocket. Docking studies further demonstrate 
how this same pocket may accommodate the cannabinoid agonist THC. Our CB1 structure 
provides an atomic framework for studying cannabinoid receptor function, and will aid the design 
and optimization of cannabinoid system modulators for therapeutic ends.

The endocannabinoid signaling system in mammals is comprised of the endogenous lipid 
messengers anandamide and 2-AG and two homologous GPCRs, CB1 located in the nervous 
system and periphery and CB2 expressed primarily in immune cells1. Human CB1 and CB2 
(42% sequence identity) are also activated by natural products5 such as THC and by 
synthetic cannabinoids, and can be inhibited by diverse subtype-selective and non-selective 
antagonists and inverse agonists6. CB1 is the most abundant GPCR in the central nervous 
system (CNS) and regulates diverse brain functions and behaviors, modulating 
neurotransmitter release and neuronal excitation through pre-synaptic activation of Gi/o, 
GIRK channels, and arrestin/MAP kinase signaling7. Endocannabinoids are synthesized 
postsynaptically by lipases, travel across synapses in a retrograde manner8, and become 
embedded in the presynaptic membrane where they can activate CB19. Beyond the CNS, 
CB1 signaling in peripheral tissues has been implicated in other physiological mechanisms 
such as release of the metabolic hormones leptin and insulin10,11. How lipidic or lipophilic 
cannabinoid agonists access their GPCR binding sites and promote receptor activation 
through specific binding interactions is unknown.
While THC was only discovered as the active chemical constituent of C. sativa in 196412, 
humans have been consuming phytocannabinoids for their psychotropic effects for 
thousands of years1. Recently alternative therapeutic uses for cannabinoid ligands have been 
pursued. Because of the involvement of the endocannabinoid system in regulating energy 
metabolism4, synthetic inverse agonists such as rimonabant and taranabant proved effective 
in the clinic for treatment of obesity, but failed to secure regulatory approval due to adverse 
CNS side effects13. Peripheral blockade of CB1 by non-penetrant inverse agonists may 
represent an alternative therapeutic strategy for obesity by avoiding the CNS CB1 
receptors10. Natural and synthetic cannabinoid ligands have also shown significant promise 
in treatment of neuropathic pain2 and epilepsy-induced seizures3. To gain further insight into 
the molecular mechanisms of cannabinoid system modulators and enable structure-based 
ligand design, we sought to crystallize and solve the atomic structure of the human CB1 
receptor.
Obtaining diffraction-quality crystals of CB1 required optimization of both construct and 
purification. We carried out differential scanning fluorimetry on the detergent-solubilized 
receptor, which identified the inverse agonist taranabant as a ligand conferring enhanced 
thermostability (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 1). To promote LCP crystallization, we 
replaced the third intracellular loop (ICL3) of CB1 with the thermostable PGS domain, 
which recently proved essential in solving crystal structures of the human orexin receptors14. 
We incorporated the point mutation T210A, which was previously shown to stabilize the 
inactive conformation of CB1 and increase thermostability15. Finally, we truncated 
CB1T210A-PGS by eliminating the first 89 N-terminal residues and the C-terminus after 
residue 421. The engineered construct binds to the inverse agonists taranabant and 
rimonabant (also denoted SR141716A) nearly identically to wild-type CB1. However

 CB1T210A-PGS has a 7-fold lower affinity for the agonist CP55940, consistent with 
stabilization of an inactive conformation (Extended Data Fig. 2) and in agreement with the 
original report of the T210A mutation15. After purifying this construct from Sf9 insect cells 
(Methods and Extended Data Fig. 3), we obtained LCP microcrystals that diffracted to 2.6 Å 
resolution, solved the structure by molecular replacement, and refined the structure to Rfree 
0.23 (Methods and Extended Data Table 1). In the monoclinic crystals, CB1T210A-PGS 
packs in a manner such that the extracellular-facing ligand binding region is not involved in 
lattice contacts (Extended Data Fig. 4a), and the receptor and ligand are well-ordered with 
low overall B factors. While truncation of the N-terminus of CB1 was necessary to form 
diffraction-quality crystals, such modifications may affect the functional properties of the 
receptor, as indicated by the variable expression and pharmacology of tissue-specific splice 
variants in this region16. However our binding data (Extended Data Fig. 2) and previous 
precedent17 show that the basic inverse agonist and agonist binding properties of CB1 are 
maintained in the receptor lacking the N-terminal 89 residues (which also contains 3 
consensus N-linked glycosylation motifs).
The global structure of the CB1 receptor, with its classical 7TM fold, is shown in Figure 1. 
By analogy to other rhodopsin family (class A) GPCRs18, the taranabant-bound CB1 
structure represents an inactive conformation with respect to G protein binding, with a 
canonical ionic lock formed between R2143.50 and D3386.30 (distance 3.4 Å; Ballesteros-
Weinstein numbering used in superscript). At the extracellular surface, the second 
extracellular loop (ECL2) and membrane-proximal N-terminal region preceding 
transmembrane domain 1 (TM1) form a lid over the orthosteric pocket, which almost 
completely shields taranabant from solvent (Fig. 1a, b). As in the structure of the lipid-
activated GPCR S1P1, a gap between TM1 and TM7 in the extracellular leaflet (Fig. 1b) 
may contribute to a membrane-embedded access channel for lipophilic agonists19. A further 
dilation of the highly conserved residues I1191.35, F3817.37, and M3847.40 lining this 
channel (Extended Data Fig. 5), would be required to facilitate entry of ligands. Previous 
molecular dynamics simulations proposed that the endocannabinoid 2-AG enters into the 
homologous CB2 receptor between TM6 and TM720, however these two TM domains are 
tightly associated in the present structure. Taranabant makes multiple contacts to both TM1 
and TM7 and fills the orthosteric pocket directly inside the TM1-TM7 opening, potentially 
acting as a ‘plug’ to block endocannabinoid entrance. The extracellular face and lid above 
the orthosteric pocket contain an abundance of acidic residues, with a negatively charged 
surface that will energetically disfavor interaction with negatively charged ligands (Fig. 1c). 
This feature of CB1 may help ensure lipid binding selectivity in a bilayer containing a high 
concentration of negatively charged phospholipids.
The first part of the N-terminus of CB1 observed in the electron density of our crystals 
begins at E100. The membrane-proximal 13 amino acids preceding TM1 fold over the 
ligand binding pocket and interact with TM2, TM3, ECL2, and TM7 (Fig. 2a, b). This 
region is highly conserved in CB1 (Extended Data Fig. 6), and contributes extensively to 
interaction with taranabant (discussed below). The occluded nature of the CB1 orthosteric 
pocket was predicted by a study showing that disulfide bond formation between C98 and 
C107 modulates orthosteric ligand binding21, however this disulfide is either not present or 
not visible in the current structure (possibly due to cysteine capping by iodoacetamide). To

 assess the flexibility of the N-terminal region of CB1, we carried out a 60 nsec molecular 
dynamics (MD) simulation on the CB1 structure embedded in an explicit POPC bilayer, 
both with and without taranabant present. In both cases, the N-terminal region was highly 
stable over the course of the simulation, exhibiting low root mean squared deviation (rmsd) 
values comparable to the entire TM bundle (Extended Data Fig. 7). These results support the 
idea that the N-terminal region of CB1 will maintain a conformation similar to the observed 
structure even in the absence of ligand. Other lipid-activated GPCRs that have been 
structurally characterized (S1P119 and LPA122) contain a disulfide-crosslinked ECL2 
structure that is very similar to CB1's, however these receptors' N-terminal regions are 
markedly different, containing α-helices that sit above the membrane and pack between 
ECL1 and ECL2 (Fig. 2c, d). CB1's occluded orthosteric pocket, with the N-terminal region 
folding over the buried hydrophobic inverse agonist taranabant, is mirrored in the structure 
of the visual photoreceptor rhodopsin bound to 11-cis-retinal (Fig. 2e)23. Further paralleling 
the CB1 structure, a gap between TM1 and TM7 was proposed as part of a channel for 
uptake and release of the lipophilic 11-cis-retinal ligand, based on the structure of the 
ligand-free opsin in an active conformation24. The opsin residues L401.35, I2907.37, and 
F2937.40 surrounding this gap are analogous to CB1 residues I1191.35, F3817.37, and 
M3847.40 (Extended Data Fig. 5).
Taranabant is a subtype-selective inverse agonist with Ki = 0.13 nM for CB1 and Ki = 170 
nM for CB225. Unambiguous electron density at the orthosteric ligand binding pocket 
(Extended Data Fig. 4b, c) placed taranabant at an unusual site toward TM1 and TM7, which 
contrasts to the space occupied by inhibitors of other class A GPCRs such as the β2 
adrenergic receptor18 (Fig. 3a). Taranabant adopts a conformation in which the chlorophenyl 
moiety extends toward TM5, the cyanophenyl buries deeper into the 7TM bundle, and the 
trifluoromethylpyridine projects into the putative access channel between TM1 and TM7 
(Fig. 3b).
CB1's orthosteric binding pocket is highly hydrophobic, as expected for a lipid-activated 
receptor. Of the 24 residues within 4 Å of the ligand, there are only three polar sidechains – 
D104 whose acidic sidechain points toward the extracellular space, S1231.39 near the access 
channel that forms a polar contact with taranabant's trifluoromethyl group, and S3837.39 that 
has been implicated in agonist binding26. In contrast, a large number of hydrophobic 
residues (including 6 Phe, 3 Met, 2 Trp, 3 Leu, and 3 Ile sidechains) line the orthosteric 
pocket and make a variety of hydrophobic contacts to taranabant, burying 1109 Å2 of 
surface area (Fig. 3b). All of the taranabant contact residues on CB1 are absolutely 
conserved across the vertebrate lineage, except that Met can replace Ile at position 105 
(Extended Data Fig. 8). The major divergence between CB1 and CB2 within the subset of 
binding residues lies in the membrane-proximal N-terminal region, where F102, M103, 
D104, I105, and F108 make van der Waals contacts to taranabant. The subtype selectivity of 
taranabant for CB1 may arise due to the divergence of this region between CB1 and CB2.
Taranabant (Fig. 3a) and rimonabant (Fig. 4a) have related chemical structures and similar 
conformational properties in isolation27. Docking of rimonabant into the CB1 crystal 
structure yielded a low-energy pose that overlaps almost completely with taranabant and 
contacts the same constellation of residues (Fig. 4a), supporting use of the current structure

 to analyze the binding modes of both ligands. Mutagenesis studies have identified several 
residues whose mutation caused a loss in taranabant and/or rimonabant binding affinity27-30. 
Indeed many of these residues are in contact with the ligand in the CB1 structure, including 
F1702.57, F1742.61, L1933.29, W2795.43, W3566.48, F3797.35, and L3877.42. However, several 
residues on TM3 and TM5 (e.g. K1923.28, F2003.36, and Y2755.39) are not within contact 
distance to taranabant, and appear to have indirect contributions to binding through 
structural stabilization or influences on CB1's conformational equilibrium.
To gain clues into the initial recognition of agonists by the CB1 receptor, we docked THC (a 
partial agonist5) into our crystal structure coordinates using the program Glide (see 
Methods). The top docking poses have the tricyclic core of THC binding between TMs 1, 2, 
& 7 (as intaranabant), while the C3 alkyl chain overlaps with taranabant's chlorophenyl 
moiety and extends toward W3566.48 (Fig. 4b). Conformational changes in this residue and 
its surroundings have been proposed as a trigger for CB1 activation, and mutation to alanine 
leads to enhanced stimulation (Emax) by CB1 agonists31. Previous mutagenesis experiments 
also identified F1742.61, L1933.29, and S3837.39 as important residues for binding of THC or 
related agonists such as CP5594026,32. These residues are in contact or in close proximity to 
THC's preferred docking pose. A caveat to these calculations is that the inactive CB1 
structure is not ideal for predicting high-affinity agonist interactions, although it should be 
noted that the crystallization construct (stabilized in an inactive conformation) still displays 
significant affinity for CP55940 (Extended Data Fig. 2). Finally, C3556.47 on the bilayer-
facing side of TM6 was reported to form a covalent adduct with a THC analog containing a 
reactive group at the end of the C3-pentyl chain33. Starting with our THC pose, such 
crosslinking would require rotation of TM6 at the orthosteric pocket during CB1 activation 
and consequent disruption of packing around W3566.48.
While our manuscript was under review, a crystal structure of human CB1 was reported34 
bound to the antagonist AM6538, which closely resembles rimonabant but with a nitrate 
group substituted on ‘Arm 2’ of the rimonabant core (i.e. the chlorophenyl moiety in Fig. 
4a). While the taranabant-bound crystal structure reported here and the AM6538-bound 
structure are in general agreement (Extended Data Fig. 9a), there are several differences that 
may be important for functional interpretation and prediction. Notably, the electron density 
for the ligand and the important N-terminal region is weak in the AM6538-bound structure, 
with high B-factors in the refined model (average B = 134.3 Å2 for residues 99-112 and 
119.5 Å2 for the ligand). In contrast, the equivalent region in our taranabant-bound structure 
is very well ordered with good density and much lower B-factors (average B = 61.7 Å2 for 
residues 100-112 and 42.0 Å2 for the ligand) (Extended Data Fig. 9b, c). The lack of clear 
density and resulting model ambiguity for the N-terminal region in the AM6538-bound 
structure may limit its utility for predicting the binding modes of other ligands. This is 
apparent in the erroneous docking prediction for taranabant, in which ‘Arm 1’ and ‘Arm 2’ 
(chlorophenyl and cyanophenyl groups) are swapped relative to their experimentally 
determined binding positions reported herein. Further biochemical and computational 
studies will be required to establish the relative utility of these two crystal structures as 
templates for ligand docking and design.

 GPCRs adopt multiple conformations, creating a complex energy landscape that allows the 
linkage between binding of different ligands and interaction with different intracellular 
effectors, such as G proteins and arrestins35. CB1 has considerable agonist-independent 
constitutive activity36, and exhibits subtle and paradoxical pharmacological properties such 
as the antagonism of cannabidiol (related to THC by a bond disconnection)5 and inhibition 
by the compound ORG27569 that nonetheless allosterically increases agonist affinity37. 
Understanding these phenomena will require additional structures of CB1 in different 
conformational states bound to ligands (orthosteric and allosteric) of differing efficacy. Our 
structure of CB1 bound to taranabant represents a first step in this direction, and provides a 
crystallographic basis for computational design of cannabinoid system modulators.
Methods
Cloning, expression and purification
The wild-type human CB1 receptor gene (Uniprot Entry: P21554) was cloned into a 
modified pFastBac (Invitrogen) baculovirus expression vector with the haemagglutinin (HA) 
signal sequence followed by a Flag epitope tag at the N-terminus, and a 10×His tag at the C 
terminus. To facilitate receptor crystallization, the 76 N-terminal residues were removed, a 
TEV protease recognition site was introduced before residue K90, and the 51 C-terminal 
residues were deleted (truncation after P421). Residues 302-332 in the CB1 intracellular 
loop 3 (ICL3) were replaced with a synthetic DNA fragment containing the 196-amino acid 
coding sequence of P. abysii Glycogen Synthase (PDB: 2FBW). Finally, the mutation 
T210A was introduced by an adapted Multi-site Quickchange protocol (Stratagene).
The final CB1T210A-PGS fusion construct was transfected into DH10Bac to produce a 
recombinant baculovirus with the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen). The recombinant 
baculovirus was used to infect Sf9 insect cell culture at a cell density of 2.5 ×106/ml, with 1 
μM taranabant (Tocris) added to the media. Infected cells were grown for 60 hours at 27°C 
before harvesting, and the cell pellets were stored at -80 °C for future use.
Sf9 cell membranes were disrupted by thawing frozen cell pellets in a hypotonic buffer 
containing 10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 160 μg ml-1 benzamidine, 100 μg ml-1 
leupeptin, 2 mg ml-1 iodoacetamide and 1μM taranabant. The cell membranes were 
centrifuged at 10,000g for 20 min at 4 °C. Membrane pellets were solubilized in a buffer 
containing 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 1% (w/v) n-dodecyl-b-D-
maltopyranoside (DDM; Anatrace), 0.2% sodium cholate, 0.2% cholesteryl hemi-succinate 
(CHS), 10% glycerol, 160 μg ml-1 benzamidine, 100 μg ml-1 leupeptin, 2 mg ml-1 
iodoacetamide and 10 μM taranabant for 1 hour at 4°C. The supernatant was isolated after 
ultra-centrifugation for 30 min at 100,000g, and incubated with Ni-NTA agarose beads (GE 
Healthcare) in batch for 3 hours at 4°C. After binding, the beads were collected by 
centrifugation at 100g and washed with five volumes of Ni-NTA wash buffer (50 mM 
HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 0.05% (w/v) n-dodecyl-b-D-maltopyranoside (DDM; 
Anatrace), 0.01% sodium cholate, 0.01% cholesteryl hemi-succinate (CHS), 10% glycerol, 
50 mM imidazole, 160 μg ml-1 benzamidine, 100 μg ml-1 leupeptin and 1 μM taranabant). 
After transfer to a gravity column, beads were washed with 15 column volumes of Ni-NTA 
wash buffer, and receptor protein was eluted in Ni-NTA wash buffer with 200 mM imidazole

 and 2 mM calcium. The eluted protein was then loaded by gravity flow over anti-Flag M1 
affinity resin. Detergent was exchanged from 0.05% DDM to 0.05% lauryl maltose 
neopentyl glycol (LMNG) on the M1 resin. Finally the pure receptor was eluted with 0.2 mg 
ml-1 Flag peptide and 5 mM EDTA. TEV protease (1:10 w/w) and PNGase F were added to 
the eluate, and protein was incubated at 4°C overnight. Finally, the receptor was run on a 
Superdex 200 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare) with buffer containing 20 mM 
HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% LMNG, and 1 μM taranabant.
Differential Scanning Fluorimetry
Protein samples were purified and prepared in the absence of ligand (apo), with taranabant, 
or with rimonabant, as described above. Differential Scanning Fluorimetry (DSF) assays 
were performed in 96-well PCR plates using an RT-PCR machine (CFX96, Bio-Rad). 
Standard assay conditions (25 μL) were 25mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.01% 
LMNG, 0.002% CHS and 10 μM corresponding ligands. The protein concentration was 2 
μM and the BODIPY FL-L-cystine dye38 was added at 2 μM final. All reactions were 
incubated at 4°C for 20 min before scanning in the PCR machine. The fluorescence was 
measured at 0.5°C temperature intervals from 4°C to 90°C by using the FAM filter set (450–
490 nm excitation, 515–530 nm emission).
Crystallization
Purified receptor was concentrated to 55 mg ml-1 using a 100 kDa cut-off Vivaspin column 
(Sartorius), and crystallized using the lipidic cubic phase method. The concentrated receptor 
was reconstituted into a lipid mixture containing monoolein plus 10% (w/w) cholesterol 
(Sigma), in a ratio of 2:3 receptor-to-lipid (by weight). Mixing was performed at room 
temperature using a syringe mixing apparatus as previously described39. The mesophase was 
dispensed in 40 nl drops onto 96 – well glass plates and overlaid with 800 nl precipitant 
solution using a Gryphon LCP robot (Art Robbins Instruments). Crystals grew to full size 
after 2 weeks at 20°C in the following overlay precipitant condition: 31% PEG400, 100mM 
Sodium Citrate pH5.5, 100mM magnesium sulfate. The crystals were harvested from LCP 
setups using MiTeGen loops and cryoprotected in liquid nitrogen.
Data collection and processing
X-ray diffraction data were collected at GM/CA-CAT beamline 23ID-B at the Advanced 
Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne IL, equipped with an Eiger 
16M detector. Data sets were acquired using a beam size of 20 μm with 1.033 Å wavelength 
X-rays. For each crystal, 50 0.4° oscillation images were collected, with 1 sec exposure and 
without attenuation of the beam. Due to radiation damage of crystals, a 97% complete 
diffraction data was merged from 42 crystals and scaled using HKL300040. The dataset was 
processed in space group P21, and a resolution cutoff of 2.6 Å was selected by examining 
CC1/2 values after anisotropy correction in HKL3000.
Structure determination and refinement
The structure of CB1T210A-PGS in complex with taranabant was solved by molecular 
replacement with Phaser41 using human S1P1receptor19 (PDB: 3v2y) and PGS42 (PDB: 
Shao et al.

 2bfw) as independent search models. The solution was improved through iterations of 
manual building in Coot43, followed by refinement using Refmac544. Translation-libration-
screw (TLS) refinement was used to model atomic displacement factors. Refinement 
parameters for the taranabant ligand were generated using the PRODRG45 web server. 
Resulting statistics for data collection and refinement are included in Extended Data Table 1. 
The final structure had 96.6% of residues in the favored region of the Ramachandran plot, 
3.4% in the allowed region, and 0 residues disallowed. Figures were prepared using Pymol 
(Schrodinger LLC). The electrostatic potential surface shown in Fig. 1c was calculated using 
APBS46.
Binding of ligands to the CB1 receptor
Ligand binding experiments on membranes containing CB1 wild-type, CB1-PGS, and 
CB1T210A-PGS were carried out based on a previously published protocol28. Sf9 cells 
expressing each construct (without any ligand present) were used to generate membranes by 
dounce homogenization and differential centrifugation18. Saturation binding was carried out 
by incubating 1.5-5 μg of membranes with different concentrations of [3H]SR141716A (54 
Ci/mmol, Perkin-Elmer) between 0.05 and 25.6 nM in assay buffer (25 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 
mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA) containing 0.1% protease-free BSA in a final volume of 250 μl 
per tube. Reactions were incubated at 30°C for 1 hr, and then quenched with 250 ul assay 
buffer with 5% BSA. Non-specific binding was determined using reactions containing 1 μM 
unlabeled ligand. Reactions were separated on a vacuum manifold using GF/C filters (pre-
soaked in assay buffer + 0.5% PEI) to retain membranes and discard unbound ligand. After 
washing 4 times with cold assay buffer, bound radioactivity was quantified using a 
scintillation counter. For competition binding experiments, aliquots of membranes were 
incubated with 3 nM [3H]SR141716A, and varying concentrations of competitor ligands 
(taranabant or CP55940) were included in the binding reactions. All binding experiments 
were carried out as three independent experiments, each performed in duplicate. Data 
analysis and fitting was performed with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc.).
Molecular dynamics simulations
The system used for MD simulation consisted of one copy of CB1 receptor (PGS domain 
removed), taranabant, 240 POPC molecules (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-
phosphocholine), 48 Na+, 57 Cl-, and 17087 water molecules. MD simulations were 
performed with periodic boundary condition to produce isothermal-isobaric ensembles using 
the modified PMEMD.CUDA program in AMBER 1447. Temperature was regulated using 
Langevin dynamics48 with a collision frequency of 5 ps-1. Pressure was regulated using the 
isotropic position scaling algorithm with the pressure relaxation time set to 1.0 picosecond. 
The integration of the equations of motion was conducted at a time step of 1 femtosecond 
for the relaxation phase and 2 femtoseconds for the equilibrium and sampling phases. After 
5-nanosec equilibration, a 55-nanosecond MD simulation was performed at 298 K, 1 bar to 
produce NTP (constant temperature and pressure) ensembles. The TM helices were very 
stable in both simulations and the mean rmsd values were 1.52±0.13 and 1.45 ± 0.23 Å for 
the apo and complex forms, respectively. The rmsd values of the membrane-proximal N-
terminal region of the complex form (0.96 ± 0.24 Å) are smaller compared to those of the 
apo form (1.28 ± 0.19 Å).

 Docking of rimonabant and THC
Molecular docking was performed for taranabant, rimonabant, and THC using Glide49,50, 
implemented in the Schrodinger software package (www.schrodinger.com). Different 
protocols of receptor preparation, grid generation and flexible ligand docking were evaluated 
and the one that produced the best docking scores was adopted. The optimal Glide protocol 
for CB1 included: only optimize hydrogen atoms in the receptor preparation; allow hydroxyl 
and thiol groups of T197, S383 and C386 to be rotatable; use the standard precision scoring 
function. We first tested our docking protocol by re-docking the taranabant ligand from the 
crystal structure. The best docking scores were -12.76 and -12.59 kcal/mol for the crystal 
conformation and a 3D conformation generated without any initial bias using the Concord 
program (www.certara.com), respectively. The rmsd between the crystal structure and 
docking pose was 0.55 Å for the Concord conformation. Next, the antagonist rimonabant 
and the partial agonist THC were docked to the binding pocket using the same protocol. The 
docking scores of the best docking poses were -8.99 and -9.36 kcal/mol for rimonabant and 
THC, respectively.
