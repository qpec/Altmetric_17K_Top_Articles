US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
On September 30, 2016, this report was posted as an MMWR 
Early Release on the MMWR website (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr).
CDC has updated its interim guidance for persons with 
possible Zika virus exposure who are planning to conceive (1) 
and interim guidance to prevent transmission of Zika virus 
through sexual contact (2), now combined into a single docu-
ment. Guidance for care for pregnant women with possible 
Zika virus exposure was previously published (3). Possible Zika 
virus exposure is defined as travel to or residence in an area of 
active Zika virus transmission (http://www.cdc.gov/zika/geo/
index.html), or sex* without a condom† with a partner who 
traveled to or lived in an area of active transmission. Based on 
new though limited data, CDC now recommends that all men 
with possible Zika virus exposure who are considering attempt-
ing conception with their partner, regardless of symptom 
status,§ wait to conceive until at least 6 months after symptom 
onset (if symptomatic) or last possible Zika virus exposure (if 
asymptomatic). Recommendations for women planning to 
conceive remain unchanged: women with possible Zika virus 
exposure are recommended to wait to conceive until at least 
8 weeks after symptom onset (if symptomatic) or last possible 
Zika virus exposure (if asymptomatic). Couples with possible 
Zika virus exposure, who are not pregnant and do not plan to 
become pregnant, who want to minimize their risk for sexual 
transmission of Zika virus should use a condom or abstain from 
sex for the same periods for men and women described above. 
Women of reproductive age who have had or anticipate future 
Zika virus exposure who do not want to become pregnant 
should use the most effective contraceptive method that can 
be used correctly and consistently. These recommendations 
will be further updated when additional data become available.
Review of Evidence
Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of congenital 
microcephaly and serious brain abnormalities (4). The risk for 
adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with maternal Zika 
virus infection around the time of conception is unknown. 
To date, there have been no published reports of adverse preg-
nancy outcomes after periconceptional Zika virus infection. 
Infections with other viruses (e.g., cytomegalovirus, rubella, 
parvovirus) around the time of conception have been associated 
with congenital infection and adverse pregnancy outcomes, 
although the exact timing of infection relative to conception 
was sometimes uncertain (5–9).
Zika virus is transmitted primarily through the bite of 
Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Zika virus can also be transmitted 
through sex without a condom. The risk for sexual transmis-
sion of Zika virus from a person infected with Zika virus 
remains unknown. Most reported sexual transmissions have 
been from persons with symptomatic Zika virus infections, 
including from men to female sex partners (10–12), from a 
man to his male sex partner (13), and from a woman to her 
male sex partner (14). Two new reports describe one presumed 
and one more definitive case of sexual transmission from 
men with asymptomatic Zika virus infection to female sex 
partners (15,16). Sexual transmission of Zika virus has been 
associated with condomless anal sex and vaginal sex and pos-
sibly also with fellatio (17). Among reported cases of sexually 
transmitted Zika virus infection, the longest reported period 
between sexual contact that might have transmitted Zika virus 
and symptom onset was 32–41 days (based on an incubation 
period of 3–12 days) (18).
Data on the detection of Zika virus RNA in semen can 
inform estimates of the periods during which sexual transmis-
sion might occur. However, detection of Zika virus RNA in 
semen might not indicate the presence of infectious virus and 
thus the potential for sexual transmission. Reports indicate that 
concentrations of detectable Zika virus RNA in semen decrease 
after infection (17,19–28). Zika virus RNA was detected in 
semen of five men more than 90 days after symptom onset, 
* For the purpose of this guidance, sex is specifically defined as vaginal sex (penis-
to-vagina sex), anal sex (penis-to-anus sex), oral sex (mouth-to-penis sex or 
mouth-to-vagina sex), and the sharing of sex toys.
† Condoms include the use of male or female condoms for vaginal or anal sex, 
male condoms for oral sex (mouth-to-penis), and male condoms cut to create 
a flat barrier or dental dams for oral sex (mouth-to-vagina).
§ A person is considered symptomatic if one or more signs or symptoms (acute onset 
of fever, rash, arthralgia, or conjunctivitis) consistent with Zika virus disease is 
reported. A person is considered asymptomatic if these symptoms are not reported.

with the longest period of reported detection 188 days after 
symptom onset (20,26,29,30). Culture is considered the gold 
standard for demonstrating the presence of replicative and thus 
infectious virus, and among four published reports of Zika 
virus cultured from semen, virus was reported in semen up to 
69 days after symptom onset (17,19,21,31). Culture methods 
varied in these studies and additional studies are needed to 
confirm the presence of infectious virus in semen.
New data on the persistence of Zika virus RNA in serum 
and whole blood might have implications, both for sexual 
transmission of Zika virus and for fetal exposure to Zika 
virus. Zika virus RNA has been detected in the serum of 
nonpregnant persons up to 11–13 days after symptom onset 
(32); in the serum of pregnant women, Zika virus RNA has 
been detected up to 10 weeks after symptom onset (33,34). 
Zika virus RNA was detected in whole blood of a nonpreg-
nant person up to 58 days after symptom onset followed by 
a negative result at 79 days; however, Zika virus could not be 
cultured at 58 days (35). Experience with other flaviviruses 
suggests that if a person’s immune system has activated an 
antibody response, viral transmission (i.e., through blood 
transfusion) is unlikely (36). Detection of Zika virus RNA 
in blood might not indicate the presence of infectious virus, 
and thus the potential risk for maternal-fetal Zika virus 
transmission periconceptionally is unknown.
Guidance for Preconception Counseling and 
Prevention of Sexual Transmission
CDC is updating its guidance on timing of conception 
after possible Zika virus exposure and prevention of sexual 
transmission of Zika virus. CDC continues to evaluate all 
available evidence and update recommendations as new data 
become available. Most of the recommendations for precon-
ception counseling and prevention of sexual transmission are 
dependent on whether persons live in or travel to areas of 
active Zika virus transmission.¶ As of September 26, 2016, 
59 countries and U.S. territories reported active Zika virus 
transmission. The Florida Department of Health identified 
two areas of Miami-Dade County with active local mosquito-
borne Zika virus transmission; as of September 20, 2016, only 
one remains an area of active transmission (37). Updates on 
areas with active Zika virus transmission are available online 
at http://www.cdc.gov/zika/geo/index.html.
For Couples Planning to Conceive Who Do Not Live 
in Areas with Active Zika Virus Transmission. Health care 
providers should discuss couples’ travel plans in preconception 
counseling. Women and men who are planning to conceive in 
the near future should consider avoiding nonessential travel to 
areas with active Zika virus transmission. 
Women who have had possible Zika virus exposure through 
travel or sexual contact and do not have ongoing risks for 
exposure should wait at least 8 weeks from symptom onset 
(if symptomatic) or last possible exposure (if asymptomatic) 
to attempt conception. Women who wait at least 8 weeks to 
conceive might have an increased likelihood that Zika virus no 
longer presents a risk for maternal-fetal transmission.
CDC now recommends that men with possible Zika virus 
exposure, regardless of symptom status, wait at least 6 months 
from symptom onset (if symptomatic) or last possible exposure 
(if asymptomatic) before attempting conception with their 
partner. CDC previously recommended that men with pos-
sible Zika virus exposure who were asymptomatic wait at least 
8 weeks from last possible exposure. The updated recommen-
dation minimizes the likelihood that periconceptional sexual 
transmission will result in fetal exposure to Zika virus. The 
recommendation to wait at least 6 months for asymptomatic 
men is based on the range of time after symptom onset that 
Zika virus RNA has been detected in semen of symptomatic 
men and the absence of definitive data that the risk for sexual 
transmission differs between symptomatic and asymptomatic 
men. Zika virus has not been definitively cultured from semen 
more than 3 months after symptom onset. It is unknown 
whether detection of Zika virus RNA in semen indicates 
presence of infectious virus and the potential for transmis-
sion. Current recommendations provide couples planning to 
conceive with periods that, based on existing data, are expected 
to minimize risk for Zika virus transmission to an uninfected 
partner. Studies are underway to better understand the persis-
tence of infectious Zika virus in semen and the associated risk 
for sexual transmission of the virus. Given that limited data are 
available, some couples in whom a partner had possible Zika 
virus exposure might choose to wait longer or shorter than the 
recommended period to conceive, depending on individual 
circumstances (e.g., age, fertility, details of possible exposure) 
and risk tolerance. For example, after consultation with their 
health care provider, symptomatic persons with negative test 
results who received testing in the appropriate time window 
and in accordance with the testing algorithm (38) might choose 
not to wait to conceive.
For Couples Who Want to Conceive, in Which One 
or Both Partners Live in Areas with Active Zika Virus 
Transmission. Women and men who reside in areas with active 
Zika virus transmission and who experience symptoms of Zika 
virus disease should be tested for Zika virus infection (38). Men 
with results that indicate recent Zika virus or unspecified fla-
vivirus infection should wait at least 6 months from symptom

onset to attempt conception with their partner; women with 
results that indicate recent Zika virus or unspecified flavivirus 
infection should wait at least 8 weeks from symptom onset to 
attempt conception. Persons who have had symptoms of Zika 
virus disease with negative Zika virus test results should talk 
with their health care provider about timing of conception in 
the setting of ongoing risk for possible exposure.
Persons living in an area with active Zika virus transmission 
should be counseled on the possible risk for Zika virus infection 
during the periconception period. CDC has developed tools to 
assist health care providers with preconception counseling (39). 
Health care providers should provide counseling about the 
potential consequences to the fetus associated with Zika virus 
infection during pregnancy, such as microcephaly and other 
serious brain abnormalities. Women and men should discuss 
their reproductive life plans** with their health care provider, 
in the context of potential and ongoing Zika virus exposure. 
Health care providers should review factors that might influ-
ence pregnancy timing (e.g., unknown duration of Zika virus 
outbreak, fertility, age, reproductive history, medical history, 
personal values and preferences). For couples who choose to 
conceive, health care providers should stress use of mosquito 
bite prevention strategies†† while attempting pregnancy and 
during pregnancy. Health care providers should counsel couples 
who decide to wait to attempt conception about strategies to 
prevent unintended pregnancy, including the most effective 
contraceptive methods (i.e., long-acting reversible contracep-
tion) and provide contraception or referral to appropriate 
providers for contraception care (40).
Special Considerations for Women Undergoing Fertility 
Treatment. Zika virus transmission through assisted reproduc-
tive technology has not been reported. However, transmis-
sion through gametes or embryos is theoretically possible. 
Recommendations for sexually intimate couples with Zika 
virus infection or possible Zika virus exposure undergoing 
fertility treatment with their own gametes and embryos 
should follow the testing and timing recommendations as 
described above; recommendations might need to be adjusted 
depending on individual circumstances and risk tolerance. 
The Food and Drug Administration has issued guidance to 
reduce the risk for Zika virus transmission by donated human 
cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products, including 
reproductive tissues (41).
For Couples Who Are Not Pregnant and Are Not Planning 
to Become Pregnant in the Near Future. Couples in whom 
the man or woman has had possible Zika virus exposure who 
want to maximally reduce their risk for sexually transmitting 
Zika virus to the uninfected partner should use condoms con-
sistently and correctly or abstain from sex for at least 6 months 
for men or 8 weeks for women after symptom onset (if symp-
tomatic) or last possible Zika virus exposure (if asymptomatic). 
Some couples might choose to use condoms or abstain from 
sex for a shorter or longer period than recommended depend-
ing on individual circumstances. Couples should be advised 
that correct and consistent use of condoms reduces the risk 
for other sexually transmitted infections.
Health care providers should discuss strategies to prevent 
unintended pregnancy with couples who do not want to 
become pregnant. Safety, effectiveness, availability, and accept-
ability should be considered when choosing a contraceptive 
method (42). Patients should be counseled to use the most 
effective contraceptive method that can be used correctly and 
consistently. Long-acting reversible contraception, including 
contraceptive implants and intrauterine devices, provide highly 
effective reversible options.
For Pregnant Women and Their Partners. Pregnant women 
living in areas without active Zika virus transmission should be 
advised to avoid nonessential travel to areas with active transmis-
sion. Persons who have traveled to or live in an area with active 
Zika virus transmission and whose partner is pregnant should 
be advised to consistently and correctly use condoms during 
sex or abstain from sex for the duration of the pregnancy. These 
actions reduce the risk for sexual transmission of Zika virus 
during pregnancy. Health care providers should ask pregnant 
women about their own and their sex partner’s history of travel 
to areas with active Zika virus transmission. Pregnant women 
with possible Zika virus exposure, either through sex or through 
traveling to or living in an area with active Zika virus transmis-
sion, should be tested for Zika virus infection in accordance with 
CDC’s “Updated Interim Pregnancy Guidance: Testing and 
Interpretation Recommendations for a Pregnant Women with 
Possible Exposure to Zika Virus” (http://www.cdc.gov/zika/pdfs/
testing_algorithm.pdf), including pregnant women with possible 
sexual exposure whose sex partner has had no symptoms of Zika 
virus disease. Further guidance for care of pregnant women with 
possible Zika virus exposure has been published (3).
Zika Virus Testing
Persons with possible Zika virus exposure who have symp-
toms of Zika virus disease should receive testing in accordance 
with CDC interim guidance: “Algorithm for U.S. Testing of 
Symptomatic Individuals” (38). CDC does not recommend 
Zika virus testing of nonpregnant persons with possible Zika 
virus exposure who do not have symptoms of Zika virus disease, 
including persons who are planning to attempt conception, or 
to assess the risk for sexual transmission of Zika virus. Zika virus 
testing for this purpose remains of uncertain value, because

current understanding of the duration and pattern of shedding 
of Zika virus in reproductive tissues is limited. Information on 
the performance of serologic Zika virus testing remains lim-
ited, with falsely positive tests resulting in avoidable stress and 
expense and falsely negative tests providing false reassurance 
and possibly leading to inadvertent fetal exposure to Zika virus.
