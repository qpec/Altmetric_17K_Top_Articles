Abstract
Although books can expose people to new people and places, whether books also have health 
benefits beyond other types of reading materials is not known. This study examined whether those 
who read books have a survival advantage over those who do not read books and over those who 
read other types of materials, and if so, whether cognition mediates this book reading effect. The 
cohort consisted of 3635 participants in the nationally representative Health and Retirement Study 
who provided information about their reading patterns at baseline. Cox proportional hazards 
models were based on survival information up to 12 years after baseline. A dose-response survival 
advantage was found for book reading by tertile (HRT2 = 0.83, p<.0001, HRT3 = 0.77, p<.0001), 
after adjusting for relevant covariates including age, sex, race, education, comorbidities, self-rated 
health, wealth, marital status, and depression. Book reading contributed to a survival advantage 
that was significantly greater than that observed for reading newspapers or magazines (tT2 = 90.6, 
p<.0001; tT3 = 67.9, p<.0001). Compared to non-book readers, book readers had a 4-month 
survival advantage at the point of 80% survival. Book readers also experienced a 20% reduction in 
risk of mortality over the 12 years of follow up compared to non-book readers. Cognitive score 
was a complete mediator of the book reading survival advantage (p=.04). These findings suggest 
that the benefits of reading books include a longer life in which to read them.

While most sedentary behaviors are well-established risk factors for mortality in older 
individuals (Wullems et al., 2016; de Rezenade et al., 2014, Katzmaryk & Lee, 2012; 
Muennig, Rosen, & Johnson, 2013), previous studies of a behavior which is often sedentary, 
reading, have had mixed outcomes. That is, some found that reading reduces the risk of 
mortality (Agahi & Parker, 2008; Jacobs, Hammerman-Rozenberg, Cohen, & Stessman, 
2008), whereas others found that it has no effect (Bygren, Konlaan & Johansson, 1996; 
Menec, 2003). However, previous studies often combined different types of reading material 
and have not compared the health benefits of reading-material type; also, the mechanism for

 the possible protective effect was not identified. We speculated that books engage readers’ 
minds more than newspapers and magazines, leading to cognitive benefits that drive the 
effect of reading on longevity. In the following study, we were able to build on previous 
studies by examining the potential survival advantage of books. We predicted that the 
survival advantage for reading books would be greater than the survival advantage of reading 
newspapers and magazines.
Reading books tends to involve two cognitive processes that could create a survival 
advantage. First, it promotes "deep reading,” which is a slow, immersive process; this 
cognitive engagement occurs as the reader draws connections to other parts of the material, 
finds applications to the outside world, and asks questions about the content presented 
(Wolf, Barzillai, & Dunne, 2009). Cognitive engagement may explain why vocabulary, 
reasoning, concentration, and critical thinking skills are improved by exposure to books 
(Stanovich, West, & Harrison, 1995; Stanovich & Cunningham, 1998; Wolf, Barzillai, & 
Dunne, 2009). Second, books can promote empathy, social perception, and emotional 
intelligence, which are cognitive processes that can lead to greater survival (Bassuk, Wypij, 
& Berkmann, 2000; Djikic, Oatley, & Moldoveanu 2013; Kidd & Castano 2013; Shipley, 
Der, Taylor, & Deary 2008; Olsen, Olsen, Gunner-Svensson, & Waldstrom, 1991). Better 
health behaviors and reduced stress may explain this process (Bassuk, Wypij, & Berkmann, 
2000).
The current study hypothesized that book reading provides a survival advantage, and that 
this advantage is mediated by cognitive engagement. To determine if the advantage is 
specific to the immersive nature of book reading, we also examined whether there is a 
survival advantage to reading periodicals (i.e., newspapers and magazines). Cognitive 
engagement might also occur while reading thought-provoking periodicals, however this 
engagement is more likely to occur when reading books due to the tendency of book authors 
to present themes, characters and topics in greater length and depth (Stanovich, 1992). 
Accordingly, we hypothesized that the survival advantage would be stronger when reading 
books compared to periodicals.
METHODS
Participants
The study cohort was drawn from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), collected by the 
University of Michigan’s Institute of Social Research and supported by the National Institute 
on Aging. The HRS has conducted national telephone surveys biennially since 1992 among 
adults over age 50. In 2001, the off-year Consumption and Activities Mail Survey (CAMS) 
was added, which contained questions about reading habits. All individuals completed 
identical telephone questionnaires and had identical follow-up procedures. This dataset 
follows individuals from the first year they answered the CAMS to December 31, 2012. 
Respondent level weights from the HRS were used in all survival analyses in order to correct 
for the oversampling design and for differential non-response. This weighting design makes 
the sample representative of the United States population (Health and Retirement Study, 
2014).

 The final sample consisted of 3635 individuals that were followed over 34,496 person-years, 
with 27.4% of the sample dying during an average 9.49 years of follow-up. Consistent with 
the older population, the sample was predominantly (62%) female.
Chi-square tests revealed that book readers differed from non-book readers in that a higher 
proportion was female, college educated, and in the higher-wealth group (all p < .001); 
These variables were included as covariates in all models. No significant differences existed 
in age, race, health, job status, or marriage status between groups at the .05 level. To be 
conservative, models were also adjusted for all of these covariates. (See Table 1.)
Measures
Predictor: Reading—Time spent reading books and time spent reading periodicals were 
assessed by the CAMS questions: “How many hours did you actually spend last week 
reading books?” and “How many hours did you actually spend last week reading newspapers 
or magazines?” These were assessed in the first year that participants responded to the 
CAMS, which was used as their baseline year. Following the model of previous studies, 
reading was split into three levels (Agahi & Parker, 2008; Bygren, Konlaan, & Johansson, 
1996); the first tertile was the reference group. The tertiles constructed for: books were: 0, 
0.01 – 3.49, 3.5 or more hours per week. The tertiles constructed for periodicals were: 0 – 2, 
2.01 – 6.99, 7 or more hours per week. Total reading scores were calculated as a sum of the 
tertiles of book and periodical reading, with scores ranging from 2 to 6. The average time 
spent reading per week was 3.92 hours for books and 6.10 hours for periodicals. The two 
types of reading were not strongly correlated (weighted Pearson and polychoric r=.23), and 
38% of the sample (n=1390) read only books or only periodicals; this allowed them to be 
treated as separate constructs.
Survival—Vital status was determined by matching participants to the National Death 
Index (National Death Index, 2015). Follow-up time was calculated from the first CAMS 
survey until either death or December 31, 2012.
Mediator: Cognitive Engagement—Cognitive engagement was assessed with total 
cognitive score (available in the supplemental Imputation of Cognitive Function Measures) 
which is a summary variable based on 8 items, including immediate recall, delayed recall, 
serial 7s, backwards count from 20, object naming, President naming, Vice President 
naming, and date naming. These items covered recall and mental status; reading has been 
found to be positively associated with both components (Wolf, Barzillai, & Dunne, 2009; 
Stanovich, West, Harrison, & 1995; Stanovich & Cunningham, 1998). This HRS cognitive 
measure has been validated for use in population surveys (Herzog & Wallace, 1997). During 
each wave of the survey, response rates exceeded 80% (Ofstedal, Fisher, & Herzog, 2005). 
Total cognitive score in 2004 was used for a mediation analysis after adjusting for cognitive 
score in 2000; the change in cognitive score ranged from a twenty point drop to a thirteen 
point gain (standard deviation = 4.31). On average, the cognitive score dropped 1.47 points 
over these 4 years.

 Covariates—Covariates were included that could influence reading or survival. They 
included individual comorbidities (cancer, lung disease, heart disease, stroke, arthritis, 
diabetes, and hypertension), visual acuity, wealth, marriage status, job status, depression, 
age, sex, race, self-rated health, and education. Self-rated health was reported on a five-point 
scale from poor to excellent. Visual acuity was self-reported on a six-point scale from blind 
to excellent. Wealth was calculated by the Rand HRS dataset as the sum of l relevant 
financial components (e.g., real estate, stocks, bank accounts, bonds) minus the sum of debts 
(RAND HRS Data, 2014), and was included as a continuous variable. Marriage and job 
status were dichotomized (married vs. not; employed vs. not). Depression was quantified 
using a yes-or-no question: “Much of the time during the past week, you felt depressed.” 
Race was categorized as Black, White, or other. Education level was used as continuous, 
quantified by the number of school years. These covariates were used in all multivariate 
models.
Statistical Analyses
Chi-square tests were completed in order to determine baseline comparability between 
groups. Unadjusted-Kaplan-Meir curves were plotted to differentiate between book readers 
and non-book readers and a log-rank test was conducted. The proportional hazards 
assumption was checked by assessing the parallelism of the log(−log(survival)) plots. 
Adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were constructed, using book reading and 
periodical reading as predictors of survival. These analyses all included respondent weights. 
To examine the robustness of the findings, sensitivity analyses for differential right 
censoring were also conducted by following participants through 2006, 2008, and 2010 
instead of through 2012.
Following the mediation steps suggested by Hayes (2013), the total association effect (c) 
was calculated by a logistic regression of book reading on mortality, and the mediation effect 
of cognitive score was calculated using the product of the coefficient method. The 
association between book reading and cognitive score (a) was calculated by using a linear-
regression model; the association between cognitive score and mortality (b) was calculated 
with a logistic model. This model also yielded the indirect effect of book reading on 
mortality, after adjustment for cognitive score (c’). The product of a and b was used to 
estimate the strength of the mediation. To calculate the significance of the mediation 95% 
confidence intervals for the model were generated using bootstrapping with 10,000 samples 
(Hayes, 2013). This method allows for greater power in the analysis and more robust 
confidence intervals.
The mediation effect was assessed using the SAS macro provided by Hayes (2013). 
Mortality status (dead or alive) as of December 31, 2012 was used as the outcome variable. 
In these analyses, book reading in 2001 was used as the predictor, the cognitive score in 
2004 was used as the mediator and survival was examined from 2004 to 2012. The models 
adjusted for all covariates as well as baseline cognitive score.
All analyses were completed in SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC). These analyses had a significance 
threshold of p < .05.

 RESULTS
In support of the prediction, book reading was associated with significantly greater survival 
for both the second and third tertiles, with adjustment for all covariates (HRT2=0.83, 
p<0.0001; HRT3=0.77, p<0.0001). During follow-up 33% of non-book readers, died, 
compared to 27% of book readers. Hazard ratios for reading periodicals were also obtained 
(HRT2=1.01, p<0.0001; HRT3=0.89, p<.0001), with a protective effect seen only for the 
third tertile. The HRs for reading books were significantly more protective than those 
obtained for reading periodicals when compared by tertile using t-tests (tT3= 90.6, p<.0001; 
tT3= 67.9, p<.0001). The total reading effect (summation of books and periodicals tertile) 
was also advantageous per total reading point (HR=.92, p <0.0001)). As described above, 
this overall protective effect appears to be driven by books.
The second and third tertiles of book reading were combined to further explore the book 
effect. This was simplified to any-book reading vs. no-book reading. Figure 1 presents 
unadjusted survival curves for book readers compared to non-book readers (HR = 0.76, p<.
0001). When readers were compared to nonreaders at 80% mortality (the time it takes 20% 
of a group to die), nonbook readers lived 85 months (7.08 years), whereas book readers lived 
108 months (9.00 years) after baseline. Thus, reading books provided a 23-month survival 
advantage. After adjustment for all covariates, the survival advantage persisted (HR=0.80, 
p<.0001), with reading books providing a 4-month survival advantage.
As an indication of the robustness of the effect, the survival advantage remained for book 
readers when stratified by sex (males, HR = 0.81, p < .0001; females, HR = 0.80, p<.0001); 
health status (less than 4 comorbidities, HR = 0.84, p <.0001; four or more comorbidities, 
HR = 0.68, p<.0001); wealth (≤$133,000, HR = 0.84, p<.0001; >$133,000, HR = 0.75, p<.
0001); and education level (high-school degree or less, HR = 0.81, p<.0001; at least some 
college, HR = 0.79, p<.0001). Medians of the health, wealth, and education variables were 
used as the stratification cut points. Models were adjusted for all covariates other than the 
stratification variable.
Sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of the results. Various exposure categorizations 
were tested, with adjustment for covariates. A significant survival advantage was still found 
for reading books with quartiles of reading time, rather than tertiles; this survival advantage 
was also greater than for reading periodicals. Additionally, both books and periodicals were 
categorized using the total reading tertile cut-points, such that all three types had 0 – 4.49, 
4.49 – 10.49, and 10.5 or more hours of reading. With this categorization, the same pattern 
of effects was found. The results were consistent regardless of the degree of right censoring: 
the same pattern of findings was observed when survival was shortened to 2006, 2008, or 
2010.
Additionally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to confirm that the survival advantage of 
reading books is not due to higher baseline cognition of book readers. Baseline cognition in 
2000 was included as a covariate in the main model. This pattern of findings replicated the 
earlier reported patterns. A protective effect was still found from reading books (HRT2=0.90,

 p<0.0001; HRT3=0.80, p<0.0001) and an attenuated effect was found from reading 
periodicals (HRT2=1.02, p=<.0001; HRT3=0.89, p<.0001).
Figure 2 shows the results of the mediation analysis, following the mediation steps 
suggested by Hayes (2013), which are outlined in the statistical analysis section. After 
adjustment for all covariates, including baseline cognition, the effect of reading in 2001 on 
cognitive score in 2004 was significant (a: β=.48, p=.01), as was the total effect of book 
reading on survival (c: β=.25, p=.04). The effect of cognitive score on survival (b: β=.07, p<.
0001) and the indirect effect of reading on survival after adjustment for cognition (c’: β= .
21, p=.10) were obtained from the same logistic model. The mediation effect of cognition 
equals ab =.03(p=.04; 95% CI: .01, .10), indicating that there was a significant complete 
mediation effect of cognitive score on the relationship between book reading and survival. 
Another mediation analysis was conducted to test the direction of the effect, using cognitive 
score in 2000 as the predictor and book reading in 2003 as the mediator. The indirect effect 
ab =.00 was non-significant (p=.99, 95% CI: −.003, .001), indicating that reverse causality 
mediation was not present.
DISCUSSION
A 20% reduction in mortality was observed for those who read books, compared to those 
who did not read books. Further, our analyses demonstrated that any level of book reading 
gave a significantly stronger survival advantage than reading periodicals. This is a novel 
finding, as previous studies did not compare types of reading material; it indicates that book 
reading rather than reading in general is driving a survival advantage.
The mediation analyses showed for the first time that the survival advantage was due to the 
effect that book reading had on cognition. The adjustment for baseline cognition makes it 
unlikely that higher cognitive level causing increased reading was driving the mediation. We 
found that book reading did not mediate the relationship between cognition and survival, so 
there was not a reverse causality effect. That is, as predicted, cognition mediated the 
relationship between reading and survival but reading books did not mediate the relationship 
between cognition and survival. This finding suggests that reading books provide a survival 
advantage due to the immersive nature that helps maintain cognitive status.
The protective effect of book reading appears to have wide applicability, as indicated by the 
covariates that were included in the models and the stratified analyses. Older individuals, 
regardless of gender, health, wealth, or education, showed the survival advantage of reading 
books. Others have found a protective effect for book reading only in women or only among 
men (Agahi & Parker, 2008; Jacobs, 2008); The contrast between those findings and our 
finding regarding the advantage for both male and female readers may be due to our study 
having a larger sample with more recent data and a more detailed measure of reading that 
assessed hours, which the other studies were unable to do because of survey design.
In addition, the stratified analyses demonstrated that the effect is not driven by education, as 
the protective effect of reading was observed independently in the low- and high-education

 groups, as well as the high- and low-wealth groups. Further, the survival advantage persisted 
after adjustment for baseline cognition. These findings make the results more robust.
Individuals over age 65 spend an average of 4.4 hours per day watching television (Bureau 
of Labor Statistics, 2014). Efforts to redirect leisure time into reading books could prove to 
be beneficial in terms of survival for this population. Also, participants in the study spent 
considerably more time reading periodicals than reading books; since the survival advantage 
is significantly stronger for book reading, switching from reading periodicals to books, or 
adding book reading to daily activities, might be worthwhile.
There are several areas that would be interesting for future research to explore, including: 
whether there are additional health benefits from book reading, other than extended survival; 
whether there are similar effects reading e-books and audiobooks, which may be more likely 
to be read in a non-sedentary manner; and whether nonfiction vs. fiction, as well as various 
genres, have differential effects, Considering that 87% of book readers read fiction (National 
Endowment for the Arts, 2014), it is likely that most of the book readers in our study were 
reading fiction.
This study found that those who read books for an average of 30 minutes per day – say, a 
chapter a day – showed a survival advantage, compared to those who did not read books. 
The robustness of our findings suggest that reading books may not only introduce some 
interesting ideas and characters, it may also give more years of reading.
