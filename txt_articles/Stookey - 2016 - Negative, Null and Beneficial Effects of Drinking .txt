Abstract: Drinking water has heterogeneous effects on energy intake (EI), energy expenditure (EE),
fat oxidation (FO) and weight change in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving adults
and/or children. The aim of this qualitative review of RCTs was to identify conditions associated
with negative, null and beneficial effects of drinking water on EI, EE, FO and weight, to generate
hypotheses about ways to optimize drinking water interventions for weight management. RCT
conditions that are associated with negative or null effects of drinking water on EI, EE and/or
FO in the short term are associated with negative or null effects on weight over the longer term.
RCT conditions that are associated with lower EI, increased EE and/or increased FO in the short
term are associated with less weight gain or greater weight loss over time. Drinking water instead
of caloric beverages decreases EI when food intake is ad libitum. Drinking water increases EE in
metabolically-inflexible, obese individuals. Drinking water increases FO when blood carbohydrate
and/or insulin concentrations are not elevated and when it is consumed instead of caloric beverages
or in volumes that alter hydration status. Further research is needed to confirm the observed
associations and to determine if/what specific conditions optimize drinking water interventions for
weight management.

1. Introduction
The CDC, USDA, American Medical Association, American Diabetes Association, American
Heart Association and American Academy of Pediatrics recommend drinking water, either instead of
other beverages or in greater volume, for weight management (see Table 1). Public health initiatives
in the U.S., U.K., Australia, France, Belgium, Spain, Greece, Poland, Mexico, Israel and Taiwan are
actively promoting drinking water for weight management [1–18].
Despite clear efforts and investment to promote drinking water for weight management, in
countries around the world, the scientific community remains uncertain whether water plays a causal
role in weight management or merely correlates with other causal factors [19]. Consumers of drinking
water differ from non-consumers with respect to several key obesity risk factors, including other
beverage intake, diet composition, physical activity, stress and smoking [20]. While some propose
that promoting the single behavior of drinking water instead of other beverages may be effective
against obesity (e.g., [21,22]), others suggest that a single-component intervention approach may be
too simplistic [23].

Reflecting uncertainty about the causal mechanism(s) and factors necessary for effect,
recommendations to drink water for weight management are relatively vague. The guidelines in
Table 1, for example, lack details and consistency about why drinking water can impact weight
management, who should drink water, and when and how to drink water to leverage the causal
mechanism. Some guidelines inconsistently recommend drinking water instead of “sugar-sweetened”
beverages “to avoid beverage calories”, while at the same time recommending 100% juice, non-fat or
low-fat milk, which, like cola, contain over 100 kcal/12-oz serving. Current recommendations to drink
water for weight management do not define a context for drinking water goals in terms of other causal
factors. They do not describe how drinking water fits into an overall food and drink pattern for weight
management. It is unclear if plain water, per se, is necessary for weight change and/or if any particular
dose of drinking water or condition is necessary to realize benefit.
Reinforcing uncertainty about the causal mechanism(s), drinking water interventions involving
different populations and study conditions report conflicting effects on weight change. While some
studies report that drinking water significantly increases weight loss (e.g., [24,25]), others report less
weight gain (e.g., [21,26,27]), no effect (e.g., [28,29]) or less weight loss [30]. Variability across studies
suggests the potential for disappointing intervention outcomes and the limited impact of global efforts
to promote drinking water for weight management.
To date, recommendations to drink water for weight management have primarily been motivated
by evidence that drinking water can decrease energy intake (EI). While drinking water can lower
energy intake (e.g., [31]), it does not always have this effect. Under some conditions, drinking water
has no effect (e.g., [32,33]) or even increases energy intake (e.g., [34]). Drinking water, furthermore,
has heterogeneous effects on key intermediates besides energy intake, namely energy expenditure
(EE) (e.g., [35–38]) and fat oxidation (FO) (e.g., [38–40]). If weight management recommendations
and interventions do not specify conditions where drinking water lowers energy intake, increases
energy expenditure and/or increases fat oxidation, null or negative effects of drinking water on weight
change would not be surprising.
Reviews of beverage effects, to date, offer limited insight regarding conditions that might
optimize the effects of drinking water for weight management, as they are focused on summarizing
the magnitude of effect across studies [19,41–43]. Available reviews alert readers to significant
between-study variation in effect size and outlier effects [19,41–43], but do not systematically evaluate
factors associated with this heterogeneity. They suggest poor study quality [19], intervention setting
or mode [44], young participant age [41] and the timing of drinking water (delay times of 30–80 min
between drinking water and meals) [41] as potential reasons for null effects of drinking water and
different hypotheses, research questions or parameters as reasons for inconsistent findings, without
considering the determinants of weight change, such as background diet and/or activity conditions.
Further research is needed to determine if, what and how background study conditions modify
drinking water effects.
Short- and long-term effects of drinking water remain to be aligned and reconciled. Daniels
and Popkin [41] point out inconsistent effects, such as significant weight change effects of drinking
water for school-age children, despite short-term null effects of drinking water on energy intake
for young children. Although reviews juxtapose short-term effects of drinking water on energy
intake with longer-term effects of drinking water on weight change [19,41,45], they do not consider
short-term effects of drinking water on energy expenditure or fat oxidation, which might also mediate
weight change effects. Reviews not restricted to randomized trials are limited with respect to causal
inference [19,41,45]. To elucidate and leverage any causal effect(s) of drinking water for weight
management, further research is needed to align short-term effects of drinking water on energy intake,
energy expenditure and fat oxidation with longer-term effects on weight.
As a preliminary step towards addressing gaps in knowledge about drinking water effects
for weight management, this qualitative review aimed to identify diet and/or activity conditions
associated with different short- and long-term effects of drinking water in the literature. Information

about conditions associated with different drinking water effects may help to generate hypotheses
about the underlying causal mechanism(s), inform the design of future meta-analyses, and ultimately
optimize drinking water interventions for weight management.
2. Methods
2.1. Protocol Overview
One reviewer identified randomized, crossover experiments that report short-term (<24 h in
duration) effects of drinking water on energy intake, energy expenditure or fat oxidation, and
randomized controlled trials (RCT) that report longer-term (>4 weeks) effects of drinking water
on weight change. The short-term period was chosen to focus on acute effects of drinking water,
excluding delayed (e.g., 2–7 days) effects, which are potentially complex, due to metabolic, physiologic
and/or psycho-social compensation. The longer-term period was chosen to exclude changes in body
weight likely to be attributable only to shifts in body water. Drinking water effects on indices of body
fat distribution (e.g., waist circumference, skinfold thickness), which may vary independent of energy
intake, energy expenditure, fat oxidation, and total body weight were not included in this review. The
same reviewer classified studies by outcome and extracted and analyzed the data.
2.2. Study Search
The PubMed database was searched for peer-reviewed article titles and abstracts, published in
English up to December 2014, using the search terms “random”, “randomly” or “randomized”,
“drinking water”, “water”, “fluid” or “placebo” and “energy intake”, “energy expenditure”,
“thermogenesis”, “Resting energy expenditure (REE)”, “respiratory exchange ratio (RER)”, “respiratory
quotient (RQ)”, “fuel partitioning”, “fat oxidation”, “weight change”, “weight loss”, “overweight” and
“BMI”. The literature search was restricted to the PubMed database, because of the large number of
studies for each of the four outcomes of interest. The goal of the review was to generate hypotheses
about intervention conditions, not to estimate unbiased effects of drinking water. Additional studies
were identified by searching the reference list of review articles [19,41–43,45–47], as well as the
references cited by each identified article.
2.3. Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Only RCTs involving human participants and random assignment to a drinking water or control
treatment were included in this review. RCTs were the focus of the review to restrict potential sources
of error and facilitate inference about possible causal mechanisms, though RCTs were included in the
review regardless of quality measures, such as double-blind design, complete protocol adherence,
patient attrition, similarity of treatment and control groups at baseline and intention-to-treat analysis.
RCTs were included in the review regardless of sample size, target population or unit of analysis (e.g.,
individual or group-level data). RCT differences in study design, protocol adherence, and/or sample
characteristics may be informative with respect to conditions necessary for effect.
Drinking water exposures eligible for inclusion in this review were plain drinking water, tap
or bottled water, carbonated or uncarbonated water, water served at any temperature, and placebo
beverages, where plain water was matched for flavor, color, texture and/or electrolyte content with
a caloric beverage using artificial, non-caloric additives. RCTs were eligible for inclusion if drinking
water was tested alone, as a single exposure, or as part of a multi-component exposure. Effects of
placebo beverages were tabulated separately from plain water effects and not excluded in the review,
because they may shed light on whether or not oro-sensory mechanisms mediate the effects of plain
drinking water. Although the effects of multicomponent interventions cannot be attributed solely
to a change in drinking water, they may nevertheless shed light on multi-factorial conditions where
drinking water interventions could impact weight change.

Studies were included in this review if they report at least one effect of drinking water on energy
intake, energy expenditure, fat oxidation or body weight change. A statement in the text about the
direction and significance of the effect, with or without an estimate of the magnitude of effect (i.e.,
if the data are “not shown”), was sufficient for inclusion. For energy intake, studies were included
in the review if they report an effect on food energy, beverage energy, meal energy or daily total
energy intake in absolute or relative (expressed relative to baseline or body weight) units. For energy
expenditure, studies were included if they report effects of drinking water on oxygen consumption,
resting energy expenditure, postprandial thermogenesis, physical activity energy expenditure or daily
total energy expenditure. For fat oxidation, studies were included if they report the rate of fat oxidation
or a measure of relative fuel partitioning, respiratory quotient (RQ) or respiratory exchange ratio
(RER). With respect to body weight change, studies were included if they report change in absolute
weight, relative weight (BMI, BMI percentile, BMI z-score) or prevalence of overweight and/or obesity.
Outcome variables could be specified at the individual, group or population level. Studies reporting
weight change over periods longer than one month were included, as these more likely reflect shifts in
body fat as opposed to body water.
Although some authors hypothesize that intake of sugar-sweetened beverages instead of
healthy alternatives, such as water, may increase the risk of obesity by increasing hepatic de novo
lipogenesis [48–51], the effects of drinking water on fat synthesis were not included in this review,
because the magnitude of fat synthesized from excess carbohydrate intake is negligible [52–55].
Absolute hepatic de novo lipogenesis accounts for less than 5 g of fatty acids synthesized per day,
even when the diet contains +50% surplus carbohydrate [56]. Excess carbohydrate intake results in an
increase in body fat stores, not by conversion of carbohydrate to fat, but rather by suppressing the
oxidation of dietary fat [57]. Mechanisms other than the provision of substrates for de novo lipogenesis
explain the lipogenic effects of sugar-sweetened beverages [58].
2.4. Data Extraction and Classification
Data were systematically extracted from each study using a standardized table that captured
information about the type of drinking water exposure and study conditions. Each line in each table
represented one exposure and condition-specific effect. Studies that tested multiple drinking water
exposures involved multiple population groups or conditions and/or observed effects of drinking
water on multiple outcomes were represented by multiple rows of data.
Each drinking water exposure was classified as a relative and/or absolute exposure. Relative
exposures compare drinking water with the same specified volume of another beverage. Absolute
exposures compare a larger volume of drinking water with a smaller volume of drinking water. Both
exposures are potentially feasible or relevant for public health intervention, because other beverage
intake accounts for over 40% of total water intake in free-living adults and children [59,60], and healthy
individuals can experience limited access to water [61], involuntary dehydration [62] and/or thirst
deficit [63] under daily life conditions.
Age, sex, weight, health status, diet and exercise conditions were considered in this
review, because these variables determine the water requirements and water intake of free-living
individuals [20,64], modify fat oxidation [65,66] and determine body weight. Although smoking
also determines water requirements and water intake, smoking was not systematically extracted
in this review, because RCTs typically recruit non-smokers and/or prohibit smoking during the
study period. Weight status was indexed as normal weight (BMI: 18.5–24.9) or overweight or obese
(BMI ě 25.0). To allow diet conditions in the short-term experiments to be compared with those
specified in longer-term interventions, diet conditions were classified as ad libitum or restricted, fed
or fasting. Physical activity conditions were classified as sitting at rest, low- or moderate-intensity
exercise or high-intensity exercise.

2.5. Data Analysis
For RCTs that report multiple effects of drinking water on different outcomes and/or for different
study groups, each effect was considered separately. Each effect was grouped according to the type
of RCT and type of outcome (energy intake, energy expenditure, fat oxidation or weight loss) and
sub-grouped by the type of drinking water effect (e.g., negative, null or positive), drinking water
exposure (absolute or relative), diet and physical activity conditions. Single-component weight change
interventions were distinguished from multicomponent interventions. The effects of plain drinking
water were distinguished from the effects of placebo beverages (water matched for color, flavor,
electrolytes and/or sweetener). To the extent possible, effects were classified based on the observed
diet and activity. If, for example, an intervention aimed to alter dietary intake, but reported no
significant change in dietary intake, then the effect was grouped with effects from studies that had
usual or ad libitum background diet.
To avoid over-representing conditions from RCTs reporting multiple effects relative to conditions
from RCTs reporting only one effect, no weight was given to the number of effects reported for a given
condition. The drinking water exposure(s), study population(s) and background diet and activity
condition(s) associated with each type of outcome were described in qualitative terms. Exposures and
conditions associated with lower total energy intake, greater energy expenditure, greater fat oxidation,
less weight gain and greater weight loss were identified.
The working hypotheses for this analysis were that conditions associated with null effects in
short-term studies would be associated with null effects in longer term studies, and conversely,
conditions associated with lower total energy intake, greater energy expenditure and/or fat oxidation
would be associated with less weight gain or weight loss in longer term studies.
3. Results
3.1. Drinking Water Effects on Energy Intake
Table 2 summarizes the exposures and conditions associated with 185 effects of plain drinking
water on energy intake in RCTs (see Appendix 1 for further detail). Drinking water reportedly lowers
energy intake in over 60 instances, has no effect in over 90 instances and increases energy intake in
30 instances.
The studies in Table 2 typically employ a preload test meal design, where each participant serves
as his/her own control and repeatedly returns to the laboratory setting on different days to consume a
different preload beverage (or no beverage) before and/or with the same test meal. In general, these
studies standardize the dietary intake, physical activity, smoking, alcohol, caffeine and medication use
for 24 h before each test day. With a few exceptions (e.g., studies that include restrained eaters [32,67]),
participants have unrestricted diets, no binge or disordered eating, no allergies, no depression and
no disease or medications that affect appetite. The studies range with respect to background levels
of usual physical activity. Some studies explicitly exclude individuals participating in more than
150 min/week of vigorous physical activity [68,69]. Others select for physically-active participants
(>3 h/week exercise) [70]. The participants sit at rest in the majority of studies. Participants consume
the test meal in the laboratory, but are allowed to behave as normal between test meal periods.
3.2. Drinking Water Lowers Energy Intake
Drinking water lowers energy intake when drinking water is compared with the same volume of
a caloric beverage. The effect is observed when drinking water is compared with various carbohydrate
solutions, 100% juice, sweetened milk, unsweetened milk, soda and alcoholic beverages. The studies
test solutions mixed in the laboratory, as well as commercially available beverages. The studies test
drink volumes ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 L. They test time intervals ranging from no delay between
beverage and test meal to a 2-h delay between beverage preload and test meal.
 Nutrients 2016, 8, 19

RCTs reporting this effect consistently involve a condition of ad libitum food intake in disinhibited
or unrestrained eaters. When non-dieting, unrestrained eaters are given a caloric test beverage before
and/or during a meal of ad libitum food, they do not completely compensate for the beverage calories
by eating less food than they do when the same meal is paired with drinking water [41,46]. In some
studies (e.g., [31]), they, in fact, eat the same amount of food, regardless of the type of beverage paired
with the meal, such that the beverage calories add on top of food energy, resulting in a net total caloric
excess for the meal that is approximately equivalent to the preload beverage energy content.
Young children compensate for preload calories by decreasing the amount of food
consumed [71,72]. The compensation may be incomplete, however, such that total meal energy intake
remains significantly elevated relative to the same meal paired with drinking water [71,72]. Pre-school
children, ages 20–56 months, consume large quantities of chocolate milk when it is offered, without
decreasing their intake of other food items, and significantly increase total energy intake [73]. Children
ages 4–6 years consume 17%–26% more energy at lunch when plain milk is offered [72]. Summarizing
across studies, when sugar-sweetened drinks are consumed within 0–30 min of a meal or juice or milk
are consumed within 2 h of a meal, the total meal energy intake is on average 10%–15% higher than
the same meal paired with drinking water [41].
Lower energy intake after drinking water instead of caloric beverages does not appear to be
explained by oro-sensory effects. The effect is observed in RCTs that compare caloric beverages with
plain water, matched for color, flavor and/or electrolyte content (highlighted in grey in the Appendix).
Table 2 includes five reports of drinking more vs. less plain water lowering energy intake, before
or during an ad libitum test meal. Three of these effects [25,74,75] are observed with 0.5 L vs. no water
in overweight or obese, older adults 30 min before a test meal, following 12 or more hours of food
and water restriction. The effects are reported for participants who were mildly dehydrated, with a
urine-specific gravity over 1.010, and thirsty, before the preload. Thirst ratings decrease significantly
after the 0.5 L water [25]. The other two effects [67,68] are observed in normal weight, younger adults,
consuming 0.3 L more drinking water between mouthfuls of food, after a standardized breakfast and
4 h of water restriction.
In sum, the diet and activity conditions associated with lower energy intake after drinking water
are ad libitum food and sitting at rest.
3.3. Drinking Water Has No Effect on Energy Intake
Forty-two null effects of drinking water on energy intake were identified in association with
drinking water instead of a non-calorically sweetened or “diet” drink (see Table 2). Energy intake
following drinking water did not differ from energy intake after an equivalent volume of sucralose,
aspartame, saccharin or xylitol for adult men and women, regardless of weight status, given ad libitum
diet and resting conditions.
Birch et al. [76] report that drinking water and sucrose preloads result in the same energy intake
(beverage preload plus test meal foods) in young children ages 2–5 years. They observe that the
children compensate for the preload calories by decreasing intake of test foods that are not preferred
foods [76]. The ability to compensate may reflect the children’s opportunity to control their own food
intake [77] and/or food preferences [78]. Children reportedly continue to consume foods they prefer,
while eliminating non-preferred foods after higher energy preloads [78].
Lavin et al. [79] report no effect of drinking water instead of a sucrose-sweetened beverage on
energy intake in restrained eaters. Individuals who restrict their food intake consciously decrease the
amount of food consumed to compensate for beverage calories.
RCTs report null effects of drinking water instead of acid whey or fructose solutions of preload
plus meal energy intake (e.g., [34]).
Under conditions of ad libitum food, many RCTs report no effect of drinking water instead of
caloric beverages on food intake, as distinct from total meal, food plus beverage, calories (24 null
effects in Table 2).

Some RCTs that report null effects of drinking water on energy intake test the effect of a small (0.3 L)
difference in absolute volume in normal weight or non-obese participants. No significant difference in
energy intake is observed when drinking water is served 90 min [32], 60 min [80], 30 min [75,80,81] or
5 min before the test meal [82] or when the water is served with the test meal foods [31,33,80], without
specific instructions about when or how to drink the water and without a meal time constraint (20 min
for the meal or no time limit specified). Compared to no drink, 0.5 L drinking water has no effect
on energy intake in overweight, obese and older after 12 weeks of a hypo-caloric diet intervention,
contrary to the significant effect observed before the diet intervention [25]. There is no absolute effect
of drinking water on food intake when overweight and obese individuals consume more vs. less water
between mouthfuls of food, contrary to what is observed in normal weight adults [68].
3.4. Drinking Water Increases Energy Intake
RCTs that report higher total energy intake after drinking water compared drinking water with
laboratory solutions of whey protein [34,83], fructose alone [84,85] and fructose mixed with glucose
(F80:G20) after an 80-min delay [86]. In these studies, the whey protein, fructose or fructose-glucose
beverages cause participants to have significantly greater blood insulin concentrations with minimal
or no increase in blood glucose immediately before they consume the test meal [83,85,86]. Insulin
response and glucose uptake are thought to play a role in the suppression of food intake following
fructose or whey protein [87,88], but the mechanism remains to be elucidated [89].
Pure fructose solutions may suppress food intake to a greater extent than drinking water for reasons
besides insulin response. The slow absorption of fructose may prolong its contact with gastrointestinal
receptors that signal satiety [90]. When ingested alone, incomplete absorption of fructose produces a
hyperosmolar environment in the large intestine that causes discomfort, diarrhea and nausea [91].
One RCT in young, normal weight humans, given ad libitum food after exercise, reports that
drinking water results in higher energy intake when 100% of usual water intake is compared with 43%
of usual intake over 48 h [92]. These data in humans [92] are consistent with findings across species
that food intake is positively associated with hydration state [93–95] (note: results from studies in
animals are not included in Table 2, which summarizes effects in humans only). In animals, drinking
water more vs. less increases, rather than decreases, food intake, if the drinking water results in a
hydrated vs. dehydrated state. Extended periods of cellular dehydration result in anorexia, due to
physiological adaptations that limit the intake of osmolytes from food. “Dehydration-anorexia” is
mediated by neural networks that control meal termination [96,97].
3.5. Drinking Water Effects on Energy Expenditure
Table 3 summarizes RCT conditions associated with 68 short-term effects of plain drinking water
on oxygen consumption or energy expenditure. Drinking water has negative, null and positive effects
on oxygen consumption or energy expenditure.
The RCTs in Table 3 are crossover experiments that typically involve multiple test days for each
participant, separated by 4–7 days. The order of the test days is randomly assigned. The tests are
performed after 24 h of standardized dietary intake, physical activity, smoking and medication use,
at the same time of day, with standardized temperature and humidity. Many, but not all, studies
familiarize the participants with equipment and procedures before the test. Food intake before each
test day is standardized by food records in the majority of studies, though some protocols provide food
in the research center [38,98,99]. Participants refrain from alcohol and strenuous exercise before each
test day. Some studies require participants to avoid corn and sugar intake before each test day to allow
the measurement of exogenous carbohydrate oxidation using a glucose stable isotope (13C-labelled
glucose). Some study protocols involve muscle biopsy [100–103] or serial blood collection via catheter
or thumb pricks [104,105]. Drinking water is provided as a bolus before the test or in bouts every
10–20 min before and during the test. Tests are performed under ambient conditions or in heat (35C
40%–50% humidity) [39,106–108], with participants sitting at rest or performing exercise. Exercise
protocols vary in intensity and involve cycling, treadmill walking or running and arm crank tests.

3.6. Drinking Water Lowers Energy Expenditure
Drinking water lowers oxygen consumption or energy expenditure when drinking water is
compared with the same volume of a caloric beverage in participants who are fasting and sitting at
rest. The greater energy expenditure associated with caloric beverages is due to the thermic effect of
the beverage macronutrients, which is proportional to the beverage macronutrient absorption and
availability. Although the rate of energy expenditure is significantly lower after drinking water than it
is after caloric beverage intake in these studies, it is important to note that the net energy balance is not
lower after drinking water. The increase in energy expenditure associated with caloric beverages is
smaller than the energy content of the beverages [35,40]. Li et al. [35], for example, report a thermic
effect of only 0.48 kJ/min following 280 mL of Sprite containing 538 kJ.
Drinking water reportedly also lowers energy expenditure relative to the same volume of a
non-caloric, caffeinated beverage (oolong tea) under non-fasting, low- to moderate-intensity exercise
conditions [38,109].
3.7. Drinking Water Has No Effect on Energy Expenditure
Drinking water has no effect on energy expenditure in studies that test relative or absolute effects
of drinking water in normal weight individuals, under fed and/or exercising conditions. The lack
of difference in energy expenditure or change in energy expenditure between treatments may be
explained by a fixed thermic response to food intake and/or fixed energy expenditure demands for
exercise. Null effects on how much energy is expended do not rule out effects on fuel partitioning
(e.g., [36]) (see below).
3.8. Drinking Water Results in Higher Energy Expenditure
The literature search identified one RCT that reports that 0.5 L plain drinking water results in
higher energy expenditure than the same volume (0.5 L) of saline or 50 mL plain water in overweight
or obese participants, who are fasting and sitting at rest [37]. The authors propose that the effect
of drinking water vs. saline is due to its low osmolality. Drinking water has a concentration far
below that of blood (osmolality < 20 mmol/kg vs. 280 mmol/kg), which allows it to move into cells,
following local osmotic gradients, and acutely swell cells, which in turn activates organ function
and/or osmosensitive neural pathways.
Boschmann et al. [37] further observe that the “RQ did not change significantly . . . Obese subjects
may be less able to switch between carbohydrate and lipid oxidation”. They speculate that metabolic
inflexibility or altered regulation in obesity might account for between-study differences in effect.
Consistent with this hypothesis, in non-randomized, pre-post studies of water ingestion in obese
participants, drinking water is associated with greater energy expenditure, with no change in RQ [110].
A randomized crossover study involving obese boys, ages 9–12 years, reports significantly higher
energy expenditure together with significantly lower RQ during exercise, 3 h after eating, when water
mixed with Splenda and 9 mM NaCl is consumed instead of a 6% glucose solution [111].
Blacker et al. [112] compare 250 mL flavored water (placebo) with 250 mL 6.4% carbohydrate
beverage in healthy men walking on a treadmill, carrying a 25-kg backpack. The placebo results in
greater oxygen consumption and lower RER than the carbohydrate beverage.

water on fat oxidation in human study participants. The effects are stratified by negative, null and

3.10. Drinking Water Results in Lower Fat Oxidation
Drinking water results in lower fat oxidation over 24 h relative (including meal periods) to the
same volume of oolong tea, in normal weight adults, studied in a room calorimeter [38].
3.11. Drinking Water Has No Effect on Fat Oxidation
Drinking water has no effect on fat oxidation in RCTs that compare drinking water with the same
volume of carbohydrate solutions, sports drinks and milk in young, normal weight, trained athletes,
during high-intensity exercise. High-intensity exercise is dominated by carbohydrate oxidation,
regardless of dietary manipulation and substrate availability [113], because carbohydrate and creatine
phosphate are the only fuel sources capable of rapid ATP resynthesis when oxygen delivery to the
muscles is compromised.
3.12. Drinking Water Results in Greater Fat Oxidation
Drinking water results in greater fat oxidation when drinking water is compared with the same
volume of a caloric reference beverage: a glucose, fructose, sucrose, whey or mixed carbohydrate
solution or commercial sports drink. This relative effect is observed in studies involving men, women
and children, in athletes and untrained individuals, when participants are sitting at rest or doing
60–120 min of exercise <70% VO2 max. This relative effect is observed with different beverage volumes,
consumed before and/or during the exercise, in the fed or fasted state.
Greater fat oxidation after drinking water instead of caloric beverages occurs in association with
lower blood glucose, lower insulin concentrations, lower heart rate and/or higher free fatty acid
concentrations. The effect is attributable to the fact that drinking water has a glycemic index of zero
and an insulin index of zero, so does not inhibit the rate-limiting biochemical steps for fat breakdown
to free fatty acids, transport of free fatty acids into the mitochondria and fat oxidation, like other
beverages that contain carbohydrate and/or trigger insulin. Even small amounts of fructose are
enough to significantly suppress fat oxidation [114]. Compared to plain water, milk significantly
increases postprandial insulinemia; “Even an ordinary amount of milk (200 mL) increase[s] the insulin
AUC to the same level as seen with white bread [115]”.
Drinking water results in greater fat oxidation in normal weight individuals who are sitting at
rest after a meal, despite positive net energy balance for hours after the meal [40]. A meal paired
with 0.5 L drinking water, for example, contains 365 kcal, 12 g fat and 55 g carbohydrate. The same
foods paired with an equal volume of orange juice contains 575 kcal, 12 g fat and 106 g carbohydrate.
Energy consumed at both breakfasts exceeds energy expended in the subsequent 150 min on both test
days. Fat oxidation is, nevertheless, significantly less suppressed after the meal with drinking water,
resulting in a significantly more negative fat balance 150 min after the meal. The estimated net fat
balance for adolescents is ´7 g (12 g consumed, 19 g oxidized) after the meal with drinking water
compared to ´2 g after the meal with orange juice. For the adults, the estimated net fat balance is
negative after the meal with drinking water, but positive after the meal with orange juice.
Absolute effects of drinking water on fat oxidation are reported by studies that compare 0.5–3.5 L
drinking water vs. no fluid intake in young, normal weight, trained athletes. The participants are fed
or fasting, sitting at rest or doing moderate-intensity exercise.
The greater fat oxidation after drinking water in these studies is associated with lower serum
osmolality, lower blood glucose and insulin concentrations, lower proteolysis and less muscle glycogen
use [36,116–119]. The effect, which is independent of beverage macronutrient content, may be
attributed to cell swelling. Drinking water is different from many other beverages in this respect.
The osmolality of Pepsi (568 mmol/kg), Coca-Cola (650 mmol/kg) and fruit juice (690 mmol/kg), for
example, is about double the normal osmolality of blood.
Cell swelling favors fat oxidation by not stimulating glycogen breakdown, proteolysis and
gluconeogenesis [120–122]. At the same time, cell swelling also improves insulin sensitivity and
 Nutrients 2016, 8, 19
14 of 30
glucose clearance. Cell swelling promotes insulin sensitivity by mediating the effects of insulin.
Insulin swells hepatocytes by activating Na+/H+ exchange and Na+K+2Cl´ cotransport [123,124]. Cell
shrinkage impairs insulin signaling and “may be a major cause of insulin resistance which develops
in systemic hyperosmolality” [123]. Drinking water does not deliver exogenous carbohydrate or
amino acids, does not trigger the production of endogenous carbohydrate or free amino acids and also
accelerates blood glucose clearance.
3.13. Drinking Water Effects on Weight Change
Tables 5 and 6 describe the weight change effects of plain drinking water from single-component
and multi-component RCTs conducted in the USA, U.K., Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark,
Portugal, Brazil, Mexico, Australia and Iran. Drinking water is reported to result in less weight loss,
no difference, less weight gain and more weight loss.
With few exceptions [125,126], the RCTs in Tables 5 and 6 were unblinded and heterogeneous in
terms of the unit of analysis, sample size, exposure and outcome specification, measures, protocol
adherence, loss to follow-up and analysis. Communities, schools, mother-child pairs or individual
children are randomly assigned to intervention or control treatment groups. Weight change effects
are defined in terms of change in weight (kg or lbs), percent body fat, BMI, BMI percentile, BMI
z-score, individual weight status, group mean status, risk or prevalence of overweight and overweight
incidence. Treatment and control groups are compared using intention-to-treat, sub-group and/or
completer analyses.
3.14. Drinking Water Results in Less Weight Loss
Drinking water results in less weight loss than the same volume (at least 24 fl oz) of non-nutritive
sweetened beverages (NNS) in one single-component RCT [30]. This study reports the effects of
drinking water instead of NNS beverages on absolute (kg) and relative (% of participants losing >5%
of body weight) weight loss over three months in overweight or obese adults who initially consumed
NNS beverages daily. The protocol restricts energy intake by providing each participant comprehensive
cognitive behavioral weight loss counseling, including a set energy intake target for weight loss. The
authors note that “assignment to the NNS treatment did not require as great a behavior change as the
Water group who had to abstain from NNS beverages” for the duration of the 12-week trial [30].
3.15. Drinking Water Has No Effect on Weight Change
Drinking water instead of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) has no significant effect on weight
change in normal weight, overweight or obese children, with ad libitum diet and usual exercise.
Sichieri et al. [127] test a school-based program of simple messages to encourage the intake of drinking
water instead of sugar-sweetened carbonated beverages (SSBs). Ebbeling et al. [128] test instructions
to replace SSBs with non-caloric beverages, with home delivery of drinking water and non-caloric
beverages. Sichieri et al. [127] report that SSB intake in the intervention schools only decreased by a
small amount (67 mL/day), and the change was offset by an increase in juice intake: “The small change
was associated with compensation . . . due to an increase in juices”. Ebbeling et al. [128] observe that
“BMI changes did not differ . . . among subjects with lower baseline body weight, (who had) lower
baseline energy intake from SSBs”.
Drinking water instead of NNS does not result in significantly different weight loss in overweight
or obese adults with ad libitum diet and usual physical activity [22,69]. Tate et al. [22] observe that the
“reduction of caloric beverages was approximately (the same in both groups).There were no between
group differences in energy intake from food.”

Drinking water instead of caloric beverages has no significant effect on weight change in
overweight or obese participants who restrict food intake [28,69]. Hernandez-Cordero et al. [28]
provide monthly face-to-face meetings with a dietician for each woman to identify a healthy diet goal.
The authors note that “the (control) group tended to have a greater decrease in energy intake from
solid foods. Thus . . . the average total energy did not differ (between groups)”. Maersk et al. [69]
compare drinking 1 L/day water instead of the equivalent volume of cola or 2% milk in 47 overweight
or obese adults. They report no difference in total energy intake between the treatment groups and
note that “the consumption of regular cola and milk . . . was generally compensated for by reducing
energy intake from other sources . . . The study was unblinded, which may have affected the subjects’
behavior to counteract some of the expected effects of the beverages, such as weight gain in the
energy-containing beverage groups.”
Small absolute increases in drinking water have a null effect on weight change [27,129].
Muckelbauer et al. [27] increase drinking water by one glass/d in normal weight, overweight and
obese children, with ad libitum diet and usual exercise conditions. The participants maintain their
background caloric beverage intake, with “no intervention effect on juice and soft drink consumption”.
Stookey et al. [129] increase drinking water by one 500-mL bottle/day, enough to dilute urine by only
148 mmol/kg, not enough to dilute the mean urine osmolality below 725 mmol/kg over the eight-week
study period. In this RCT, “participants reported lack of thirst as barriers to drinking more water.”
Participants in this study were overweight or obese children, with a restricted diet (limited caloric
beverages and high glycemic foods) and usual physical activity levels [129].
Multi-component interventions that report null effects on weight target reduction of SSB intake
only fail to increase intake of drinking water and/or do not decrease caloric beverage intake report,
despite protocol intent to alter beverage intake (see the Appendix).
3.16. Drinking Water Results in Less Weight Gain
Drinking water results in less weight gain in RCTs that involve ad libitum diet and usual physical
activity. The studies vary with respect to drinking water exposure and participant population. Less
weight gain is associated with drinking water instead of SSBs and juice [21,127] and drinking water
instead of skim milk [130] in overweight or obese participants. In school-based RCTs, which involve
all students, regardless of weight status, smaller increases in the prevalence of overweight is associated
with drinking relatively more water and less “fizzy” drinks [26] and one glass/d more drinking
water [27]. Absolute increases in intake of drinking water intake, without change in absolute caloric
beverage intake, is achieved by teachers promoting the filling of water bottles in the morning and
intake of drinking water during class [27]. Muckelbauer et al. [27] note that “children with a body
weight close to the cutoff point for overweight received the greatest benefit”.
Ebbeling et al. [21] suggest that decreases in sugar intake from beverages mediate the effect
of drinking water instead of SSBs: “When sugar intake was added to the model, the intervention
effect on BMI was strongly attenuated and no longer significant”. Arnberg et al. [130] and their study
participants believed that “a high intake of milk protein would reduce body weight . . . (and) were
surprised to see an increase in the (BMI-for-age Z-scores) BAZ following skim milk”. Given their belief
and expectations, conscious compensation or food intake regulation is an unlikely explanation for less
weight gain after drinking water instead of skim milk, though the study was unblinded.
In multi-component RCTs involving children, under conditions of ad libitum diet and usual activity,
drinking water instead of SSB, juice and milk and absolute increases of drinking water during break
time result in less weight gain.
3.17. Drinking Water Results in More Weight Loss
Drinking water instead of SSBs results in more weight loss in RCTs that involve overweight or
obese participants with ad libitum, usual food intake and usual physical activity levels. The effect is
not attributed to calories from SSB only; the authors comment that “the greater weight loss . . . was
 Nutrients 2016, 8, 19
18 of 30
not simply because of a greater decrease in energy intake from SSBs. Perhaps some individuals are
inherently more susceptible than others [128]”.
Large absolute increases in drinking water are associated with significantly greater weight loss in
overweight participants who significantly dilute urine and restrict diet [25,129,131]. The effects are not
solely attributed to decreases in total energy intake. Dennis et al. [25] observe that “beverage energy
intake declined by 100 kcal, but did not differ between groups and is thus unlikely to explain our
findings. We did not detect group differences in total energy intake”. Akers et al. [131] observe that
self-monitoring of pre-meal water consumption may be an effective approach, beyond that achieved by
daily monitoring of body weight, step count, and fruit and vegetable consumption”. Stookey et al. [129]
observe that the study participants who drank enough water to dilute urine below 500 mmol/kg
decreased their saliva insulin by 81% to below 15 pmol/L over the last three weeks. Saliva insulin
was above this value for study participants who did not drink enough water to dilute urine, despite
similar adherence to the study foods. The decrease in saliva insulin partially mediated the association
between diluting urine osmolality below 500 mmol/kg and weight loss.
One multi-component RCT reporting that drinking water results in more weight loss included
three times as many overweight children in the intervention group than the control group [132]. The
study included toddlers, who normally have a decrease in BMI as they become more mobile. Parents
were instructed to “put water on the table during every meal”. Water intake increased significantly
more in the intervention group (by +10% vs. +6% of beverage intake), while treatment groups did
not differ with respect to the change in the intake of soft drinks, sweet milk, unsweetened milk, fruit,
vegetables, sweets, snacks, physical activity or screen time. Another multi-component RCT reporting
more weight loss attributes the greater weight loss to changes in overweight children close to the cutoff
for normal weight [133].
4. Discussion
The goal of this literature review was to explore for RCT conditions associated with different effects
of drinking water on energy intake, energy expenditure, fat oxidation and body weight. Awareness
about sources of heterogeneity in drinking water effects may generate hypotheses about ways to
optimize drinking water interventions for weight management, to maximize the impact of global
investments in drinking water initiatives.
The literature review identified over 440 effects of plain drinking water on energy intake, energy
expenditure, fat oxidation and body weight, reported by 134 RCTs. The effects ranged the full spectrum,
from negative to null and positive effects, for each outcome. Drinking water reportedly lowers, has no
effect, and increases energy intake, energy expenditure, fat oxidation and weight.
Countries and communities worldwide are promoting drinking water for weight management,
implicitly expecting drinking water to lower energy intake, increase energy expenditure, increase fat
oxidation, decrease weight gain (support obesity prevention) and/or facilitate weight loss (support
obesity treatment). This expectation may not be met if the range of possible effects of drinking water is
not restricted to the desired effects. Indeed, of 115 reported effects of drinking water on weight from
RCTs, 83 were null effects. Meta-analyses of beverage change effects on weight report small average
effect sizes across studies and conclude that evidence is inconsistent and weak [19,42]. If the studies
test fundamentally different conditions and questions, however, it may be misleading to estimate an
average effect size across studies [43,134].
Mattes et al. [43] call for work to resolve the discrepant literature and “move the field forward”.
They argue that clinical recommendations and public policy should be better designed to meet the
needs of the susceptible group(s), given that beverage effects may not be effective for everyone, and
one-size-fits-all recommendations and policy may place undue restrictions on the total population. To
inform such better design, studies are needed to characterize the underlying causal mechanism(s) [43].
To specify drinking water interventions, to restrict the range of possible effects to the desired
effects, public health policy makers and practitioners need to be able to define the “active ingredient”,
 Nutrients 2016, 8, 19
19 of 30
which may include aspects of the background context [135]. The setting in which the intervention
is delivered and/or elements of the intervention process influence the intervention outcome and
generalizability. “Any attempts to extrapolate from study settings to the real world are hampered
by a lack of understanding of the key elements of individuals and the settings in which they were
trialed” [136].
The findings of this review suggest that key contextual elements for drinking water effects on
weight may include the types of beverages consumed at baseline, i.e., the types of beverages to
potentially be replaced, individual dietary restraint, food preferences, background diet, activity level,
weight status and “metabolic flexibility”. Given the potential for negative, null or positive effects
of drinking water on energy intake, as Andrade et al. [67] observe, “recommendations directed at
changing eating behavior for the purpose of energy intake reduction should be made carefully.”
4.1. Aligning Conditions Associated with Short- and Long-Term Effects of Drinking Water
4.1.1. Conditions Associated with Null Effects
In short-term RCTs, null effects of drinking water on meal energy intake are observed when
drinking water does not replace caloric beverages or is consumed instead of “diet” drinks with
ad libitum food, offered instead of a caloric beverage to restrained eaters, or offered with non-preferred
foods to young children. Drinking water has null effects on energy expenditure for normal weight
individuals who can alter fuel partitioning instead of energy expenditure. Drinking water does not
increase fat oxidation during high-intensity exercise, when anaerobic metabolism and carbohydrate
oxidation predominate [137]. Drinking water does not increase fat oxidation when high glycemic
foods are consumed under resting conditions, because increases in blood glucose and insulin suppress
fat oxidation. When high glycemic foods are consumed, postprandial insulin concentrations do
not vary significantly by beverage type [115]. Drinking water does not increase fat oxidation when
the volume of drinking water consumed is less than 0.5 L and/or there is an indication of cell
dehydration (elevated serum or urine osmolality), under fasting conditions, at rest or during low-to
moderate-intensity exercise.
In longer term RCTs, conditions associated with null effects on weight change are similar to those
associated with short-term null effects. Longer term RCTs report no effect of drinking water on weight
change when not all caloric beverages are targeted for replacement/displacement, when the control or
reference condition for relative drinking water effects is not a caloric beverage, when there is a low
baseline intake of SSB, when caloric beverages do not change as a result of the intervention, when
participants have restricted food intake, and when the volume of drinking water is not enough to
dilute urine. It is concerning that recommendations to drink water for weight management in the
United States (see Table 1) advocate conditions that are associated with a null effect on weight change
in the literature.
4.1.2. Conditions Associated with Less Weight Gain or More Weight Loss
Table 7 summarizes RCT conditions of studies that report that drinking water lowers energy
intake, increases energy expenditure and/or increases fat oxidation. Drinking water lowers energy
intake and increases fat oxidation when it is consumed instead of all caloric beverages, not only soda,
but also milks, juices and alcohol, by non-dieting individuals, regardless of age, sex and weight status,
with ad libitum food intake and either resting or low- to moderate-intensity exercise.
Drinking water increases energy expenditure for obese individuals who are fasting and sitting at
rest, if they consume 0.5 L or more and have no change in RQ or heart rate. Drinking water increases
fat oxidation for individuals who are fasting (or have fasting glucose and insulin concentrations), at
rest or during low- to moderate-intensity exercise, if the volume consumed is 0.5 L or more.

Table 8 summarizes the effects of drinking water on weight outcomes, stratified by type of drinking
water exposure and RCT conditions. Drinking water results in less weight gain for individuals with
ad libitum diet and usual exercise, when it is consumed instead of all caloric beverages, not only
SSB. Drinking water results in greater weight loss for overweight or obese individuals when diet is
restricted, the usual level of exercise is maintained and the volume of drinking water exceeds 1 L/day,
enough to dilute urine.

4.2. Hypotheses to Pursue in Future RCTs and Meta-Analyses
The results of this review suggest that exposures and conditions that might optimize drinking
water effects for weight management may include:
(1)
Drinking water instead of all caloric beverages for non-dieting individuals who are consuming
low-glycemic, low-fat food ad libitum (not deliberately or consciously restricting food intake) and
maintaining usual levels of low- to moderate-intensity physical activity: These conditions would
be hypothesized to prevent weight gain via decreases in beverage and total energy intake and
increases in fat oxidation that allow individuals to burn up the fat consumed in each meal before
their next meal, even if they sit at rest during the postprandial period [40]. When drinking water
is consumed instead of a caloric beverage with low glycemic foods, the postprandial rise in serum
insulin is significantly smaller and of shorter duration (< 1 h vs. 2 h) [115].
 Nutrients 2016, 8, 19
21 of 30
(2)
Increasing drinking water by more than 1 L/day for overweight or obese individuals with a
restricted, hypocaloric and/or low glycemic diet that lowers blood glucose and insulin levels:
The latter conditions would be hypothesized to accelerate weight loss by increasing energy
expenditure and/or fat oxidation by reducing osmotic stress on cells, improving insulin resistance,
reducing gluconeogenesis and/or improving postprandial glucose clearance. Because the caloric
deficit is pre-defined and consciously maintained in this condition, the effects of drinking water
on weight loss observed under this condition would not be expected to be mediated by a change
in total energy intake. The following states favor fat oxidation: fasting, cell hydrated, not
oxygen-limited, low cortisol/stress, moderate- and low-intensity exercise.
Intake of high glycemic, starchy staple food at each meal can be expected to suppress fat oxidation
during the postprandial period and mask drinking water effects. Multi-component interventions have
tested drinking water effects concurrent with shifts in fruit and vegetable and/or fat intake, but have
yet to test for interactive effects of drinking water (beverage with zero glycemic, zero insulinemic
index) and low glycemic food intake (glycemic index <50, glycemic load <11).
The hypothesized mechanisms can also be expected to be subject to effect modification by factors
such as age, sex, body size, fat intake, exercise, insulin levels and metabolic flexibility or adaptation.
Very young children may be more able to compensate for beverage calories and, thus, less able to
benefit from drinking water in terms of lower total energy intake. Young males and obese individuals
are more likely to have elevated urine osmolality (evidence of osmotic stress on cells) [138–140] and
lower fat oxidation rates [141,142] and may require a greater absolute dose of drinking water to dilute
urine and observe an effect on weight than girls and normal weight individuals. High fat intake may
cause a positive fat balance, despite a significantly increased rate of fat oxidation. High-intensity
exercise favors carbohydrate oxidation over fat oxidation, regardless of the type of beverage consumed.
Individuals may alter energy intake, energy expenditure and/or fat oxidation at later meals or on
subsequent days to compensate for the acute effects of drinking water (e.g., [82,143]). To determine if
and/or how RCT conditions can be leveraged to maximize the impact of drinking water interventions
for weight management, studies are needed to clarify causal mechanisms, including effect modifiers.
Contrary to assertions that “targeting water and diet drinks may not be important or necessary
in the interventions aimed at reducing the consumption of sugar sweetened beverages among
adolescents [144]”, explicitly specifying the target beverage change in absolute and relative terms may
help to optimize intervention effects. Drinking water effects are contingent on other beverage intake
and/or food intake, which can shift deliberately or unconsciously. Even with no change in absolute
intake of drinking water, the relative intake of drinking water changes when other beverage intake
is increased or decreased. In the study by Veitch et al. [144], for example, while absolute intake of
drinking water remained constant, relative intake of drinking water increased from 26% to 38% of
beverage intake. Relative shifts in the beverage intake pattern significantly impact the composition
and osmolality of beverage intake, which in turn impact beverage absorption and metabolism. A priori
specification of target absolute and relative beverage and food intake may avoid wasted investment
from unanticipated beverage and food shifts.
The RCT effects reviewed here suggest that beverages sweetened with non-caloric sweeteners,
aspartame, acesulfame-K, sucralose and/or saccharin have comparable effects to drinking water
with respect to energy intake. Further research is needed to determine if non-caloric sweeteners are
comparable to drinking water with respect to effects on energy expenditure, fat oxidation and weight
change, accounting for ad libitum or restricted diet and beverage volume.
Accumulated data from crossover experiments and RCTs indicate that milk, even skim milk, is
not comparable to drinking water in terms of its effects on energy intake, fat oxidation and weight
change. Milk results in significantly greater energy intake, less fat oxidation and more weight gain [130]
than drinking water. Milk is proposed as an alternative to drinking water, because of its nutritional
value (see Table 1), concern that individuals will fail to meet nutrient intake recommendations if they
eliminate milk from the diet [145] and the belief that milk facilitates weight management [130]. It is
 Nutrients 2016, 8, 19
22 of 30
important to clarify that milk results in greater weight loss when it replaces calories from food [146],
not when it replaces drinking water in the diet [130]. RCTs are needed to test the weight management
effects of drinking water instead of other beverages and eating dairy instead of other food.
4.3. Limitations
Several factors limit the interpretation of the present results. The goal of this exploratory review
was to identify conditions associated with different types of drinking water effects. The goal was
not to estimate a generalizable, average effect size across studies. This qualitative analysis draws
on a set of unweighted, non-independent effects of drinking water from heterogeneous RCTs for
hypothesis generation purposes only. It remains to be determined if the conditions that appear to
be associated with particular effects, in this analysis, in fact cause negative, null and/or beneficial
outcomes of drinking water for particular population groups, in controlled trials and quantitative
meta-analyses. Effective drinking water recommendations and interventions depend on clarifying the
causal mechanism(s) of effect(s).
The RCTs included in this review may not represent all RCTs reporting the effects of drinking
water on the outcomes of interest, because RCTs not published in English and/or not indexed in
PubMed may have been missed. All references in published systematic reviews and meta-analyses
summarizing drinking water effects of weight change were, nevertheless, considered for inclusion
in this analysis. Previous reviews apply stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria, following PRISMA
guidelines (e.g., [19]).
The review excludes effects of drinking water over periods longer than 24 h, but shorter than one
month, so does not contribute information about compensation over hours or days that might negate or
magnify short-term effects of drinking water. The review did not consider conditions associated with
the effects of drinking water exposures sustained between two days and one month. Chronic exposure
to drinking water, over multiple days or weeks, can result in metabolic and physiologic changes
not seen with acute exposure to drinking water [147]. The alignment of conditions associated with
beneficial effects of drinking water over <12 h and >1 month, nevertheless, suggests that short-term
effects of drinking water do translate, at least to a certain extent, into long-term weight change.
The review only systematically abstracted information about participant age, gender, weight
status, diet and activity. Future studies should also consider other key effect modifiers and elements of
context not covered in this study, such as the timing of the drinking water exposure, participant health
and metabolic flexibility, in particular. The timing of beverage intake relative to meals may modify
beverage effects (e.g., [67,68,143]). More research is needed to determine if overnight water-restricted
older, overweight or obese individuals can lower energy intake by drinking water before meals, and if
normal weight individuals might lower total energy intake by drinking more water between mouthfuls
during meals.
Limited information was available from RCTs about the relative adequacy of water intake (e.g.,
total water intake, hydration biomarkers), diet and activity. It is unknown if unspecified usual dietary
intake involves high glycemic foods, energy-dense (low water) foods and/or typical Western diets
and/or if the unspecified level of usual activity is sedentary. Studies are warranted to describe diet
and activity conditions in greater detail.
Further work is needed to corroborate associations between RCT conditions and the direction of
effect, accounting for parameters of study quality, which were not addressed here. RCTs were included
regardless of sample size, participant health status, study quality, protocol deviations, non-adherence,
loss to follow-up and stratified and no intention to treat analyses. Intervention targets not met are
frequent in longer term RCTs (e.g., [29,129,148]).
More effort is needed to align short- and long-term effects of drinking water in a focused way
for particular target populations and conditions. Doing this will require filling gaps in the short- and
long-term literature. For example, to align and inform interventions for non-athlete, overweight and
obese children, short-term RCTs and meta-analyses are needed to characterize short-term effects of
 Nutrients 2016, 8, 19
23 of 30
drinking water on energy intake, energy expenditure and fat oxidation in non-athlete, overweight or
obese children, sitting at rest.
Studies published after December 2014 were not included in the present analysis. One 12-week
RCT, published after that date [149], reports that obese adults randomly assigned to drink 500 mL
water 30 min before their main meals lost significantly more weight than the control group, assigned to
imagine their stomach was full before meals. The results are consistent with the weight loss effects of
increasing drinking water by more than 1 L/day for overweight or obese individuals with a restricted,
hypocaloric or low glycemic diet [25,129,131].
5. Conclusions
RCTs report negative, null and positive effects of drinking water on energy intake, energy
expenditure, fat oxidation and weight change. Heterogeneity across studies is associated with different
study conditions. Conditions that are associated with null effects over the short term are also associated
with null effects over the longer term. To optimize drinking water initiatives for weight management,
future research, meta-analyses and public health interventions should pursue conditions that decrease
energy intake, increase energy expenditure and/or increase fat oxidation.
