IMPORTANCE Nitric oxide signaling alterations in outflow facility and retinal blood flow
autoregulation are implicated in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Nitric oxide donation
has emerged as a POAG therapeutic target. An exogenous source of nitric oxide is dietary
nitrates.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association between dietary nitrate intake, derived mainly from
green leafy vegetables, and POAG.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We followed up participants biennially in the
prospective cohorts of the Nurses’Health Study (63 893 women; 1984-2012) and the Health
Professionals Follow-up Study (41 094 men; 1986-2012) at each 2-year risk period. Eligible
participants were 40 years or older, were free of POAG, and reported eye examinations.
EXPOSURES The primary exposure was dietary nitrate intake. Information on diet and
potential confounders was updated with validated questionnaires.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The main outcome was the incidence of POAG and POAG
subtypes; 1483 cases were confirmed with medical records and classified into subtypes
defined by intraocular pressure (IOP) (�22 or <22 mm Hg) or by visual field (VF) loss pattern
at diagnosis (peripheral loss only or early paracentral loss). Cohort-specific and pooled
multivariable rate ratios (MVRRs) and 95% CIs were estimated.
RESULTS During 1 678 713 person-years of follow-up, 1483 incident cases of POAG were
identified. The mean (SD) age for the 1483 cases was 66.8 (8.3). Compared with the lowest
quintile of dietary nitrate intake (quintile 1: approximately 80 mg/d), the pooled MVRR for the
highest quintile (quintile 5: approximately 240 mg/d) was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.66-0.93; P for
trend = .02). The dose response was stronger (P for heterogeneity = .01) for POAG with early
paracentral VF loss (433 cases; quintile 5 vs quintile 1 MVRR = 0.56; 95% CI, 0.40-0.79; P for
trend < .001) than for POAG with peripheral VF loss only (835 cases; quintile 5 vs quintile
1 MVRR = 0.85; 95% CI, 0.68-1.06; P for trend = .50). The association did not differ (P for
heterogeneity = .75) by POAG subtypes defined by IOP (997 case patients with IOP �22
mm Hg: quintile 5 vs quintile 1 MVRR = 0.82; 95% CI, 0.67-1.01; P for trend = .11; 486 case
patients with IOP <22 mm Hg: quintile 5 vs quintile 1 MVRR = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.53-0.96; P for
trend = .12). Green leafy vegetables accounted for 56.7% of nitrate intake variation.
Compared with consuming 0.31 servings per day, the MVRR for consuming 1.45 or more
servings per day was 0.82 for all POAG (95% CI, 0.69-0.97; P for trend = .02) and 0.52 for
POAG with paracentral VF loss (95% CI, 0.29-0.96; P for trend < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Higher dietary nitrate and green leafy vegetable intake was
associated with a lower POAG risk, particularly POAG with early paracentral VF loss at diagnosis.

E
levated intraocular pressure (IOP) and impaired auto-
regulation of optic nerve blood flow are implicated in
primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG).1-10 Endothelial
dysfunction, a key contributor to vascular regulatory impair-
ment, is involved in both processes.11 The vascular endothe-
lium regulates the microcirculation via vasoactive factors; one
potent factor is nitric oxide (NO). In the L-arginine–NO path-
way, NO is formed from L-arginine and oxygen by NO syn-
thases (NOSs), such as endothelial NOS (NOS3).12
Abundant evidence supports NO’
s role in POAG
pathogenesis.13 With administration of a systemic NOS inhibi-
tor, differences in ocular blood flow response were observed
between cases with POAG and controls.14 In addition, poly-
morphisms in NOS3 (OMIM 163729), the gene for NOS3, were
associated with lower blood NO levels15-19 and POAG.16,20-22
As an alternative to the L-arginine–NO pathway, when un-
der hypoxia23,24 or when NOS may be dysfunctional,14,16,20,21
which may occur in POAG, exogenous nitrate can be reduced
to nitrite25-27 by commensal bacteria28-30 and subsequently
converted enzymatically or nonenzymatically to NO in
tissues26,31-33 in the nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway.34-38 Evi-
dence suggests that nitrate or nitrite, precursors for NO, is ben-
eficial for blood circulation.34,39-42 Dietary nitrate is predomi-
nately derived from green leafy vegetables,43 which
contribute approximately 80% of nitrate intake.29 Although
plasma nitrite levels16,44 or intake of specific vegetables45,46
have been associated with POAG, to our knowledge, dietary
nitrate intake as a specific nutrient has not been evaluated.
Therefore, we evaluated dietary nitrate and incident POAG in
a longer-than-25-year prospective study of 63 893 women in
the Nurses’Health Study (NHS) and 41 094 men in the Health
Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS).
Methods
TheNHSbeganin1976with121700USregisteredfemalenurses
(30-55yearsold)whocompletedamailedquestionnaire.47The
HPFS began in 1986 with 51 529 US male health professionals
(dentists,veterinarians,pharmacists,optometrists,osteopaths,
and podiatrists) aged 40 to 75 years.48 Participants have been
followedupbienniallywithmailedquestionnairesofhealth,diet,
and diseases, such as glaucoma. Follow-up rates were high
(>85%).ThehumanresearchcommitteesofBrigham&Women’

Thefirstdetailedassessmentofdietwithasemiquantitative
foodfrequencyquestionnaire(SFFQ)wasconductedin1984for
the NHS and 1986 for the HPFS; thus, these dates are the base-
line years. Participants contributed person-years in approxi-

participants were 40 years or older (when glaucoma risk in-
creases) and reported undergoing an eye examination in the
2-year risk period (to minimize possible detection bias).
We excluded at baseline the following NHS and HPFS par-
ticipants, respectively: 47 512 and 1596 who did not respond
to baseline SFFQs or had outlying total caloric intakes; 4011
and1927withprevalentcancers,excludingnonmelanomaskin

with prevalent glaucoma; 450 and 1874 lost to follow-up from
1976 to 1984 (NHS) or less than 2 years of baseline (NHS and
HPFS); and 2391 and 3251 who never reported an eye exami-
nation during follow-up. After these exclusions, 66 435 and
41 846 NHS and HPFS participants, respectively, were eli-
gible; however, at the beginning of each 2-year risk period, we
applied additional provisional exclusions for age and eye ex-
amination status. For example, for the 1984-1986 (NHS) and
1986-1988 (HPFS) risk periods, respectively, only 45 955 and
29 039 contributed person-years after we provisionally ex-
cludedparticipants(20 480and12 807)whowereyoungerthan
40 years and reported no eye examinations. In later periods,
those provisionally excluded were allowed in analyses if they
met eligibility criteria during follow-up. Thus, during the study
period, 63 893 and 41 094 NHS and HPFS participants, respec-
tively, ever contributed person-years.
Ascertainment of Cases With POAG and Classification
of POAG by IOP and VF Loss Pattern
We included 1483 cases with confirmed incident POAG (1000
women and 483 men). Glaucoma case ascertainment occurred
bienniallywhenweaskedabouteyeexaminationsandphysician
diagnoses of glaucoma. For those self-reporting glaucoma, we
sought permission to contact eye care professionals, who were
requested to send all visual fields (VFs) with medical records or
acompletedglaucomaquestionnairewithitemsonmaximalIOP,
statusofthefiltrationapparatus,opticnervestructuralinforma-
tion, ophthalmic surgery, and VF loss. Records were reviewed
by a glaucoma specialist (L.R.P.), masked to participants’diet,
to confirm POAG cases using standardized criteria.
Cases had to be appraised as definite or probable POAG.
For definite POAG cases (>70% of all cases), the following cri-
teria were required: (1) gonioscopy in which the filtration angle
was not occludable in either eye; (2) slitlamp biomicroscopy
with no signs in either eye of pigment dispersion syndrome,
uveitis, exfoliation syndrome, trauma, or rubeosis; and (3) re-
producible VF defects consistent with POAG on 2 or more re-
At a Glance
Question: What is the association between dietary nitrate intake,
derived mainly from green leafy vegetables, and primary
open-angle glaucoma (POAG)?
Findings: Compared with the lowest quintile of dietary
nitrate intake (approximately 80 mg/d), the highest quintile
(approximately 240 mg/d) was associated with a 21% lower risk of
all POAG and 44% lower risk of POAG with early paracentral visual
field loss, a subtype of POAG linked to dysfunction in blood flow
autoregulation.
Meaning: These findings could have important implications
for POAG if the association of higher dietary nitrate and green
leafy vegetable intake with a lower POAG risk is confirmed in
observational or intervention studies.

liable tests. For probable POAG cases, the slitlamp examina-
tion and VF criteria were also required, but documentation of
pupil dilation without subsequent adverse events was ac-
cepted in lieu of gonioscopy. For VF defects, the type of pe-
rimetry was not restricted; however, full static threshold test-
ing was documented in 95% and kinetic VFs in less than 1%.
For static threshold or suprathreshold tests, the following re-
liabilitydefinitionswereused:fixationlossof33%orless,false-
positive rate of 20% or less, and false-negative rate of 20% or
less. For kinetic VFs, a VF test result was considered reliable
unless the examiner noted to the contrary.
New glaucoma diagnoses were self-reported by 8611 and
3791 NHS and HPFS participants, respectively, and these di-
agnoses were confirmed as various types of glaucoma or sus-
picion of glaucoma in 5487 (63.7%) and 2058 (54.3%): poten-
tial POAG with VF loss (2290 [26.6%] and 985 [26.0%]),
elevated IOP or optic disc cupping only (1559 [18.1%] and 612
[16.1%]), and other types of glaucoma or suspicion of glau-
coma (1639 [19.0%] and 461 [12.2%]). The remaining diagno-
ses (3124 [36.3%] and 1733 [45.7%]) were unconfirmed be-
cause participants (689 [8.0%] and 563 [14.9%]) or eye care
professionals (435 [5.1%] and 204 [5.4%]) were unreachable,
participants denied permission for record review (984 [11.4%]
and 362 [9.7%]), participants indicated the report was erro-
neous (835 [9.7%] and 547 [14.4%]), or eye care professionals
refuted the glaucoma diagnosis (181 [2.1%] and 57 [1.5%]).
Among those diagnoses classified as potential POAG with VF
loss, we included only the definite or probable POAG cases
(NHS, 1000 and HPFS, 483); other confirmed and uncon-
firmed self-reports were censored as of the diagnosis date.
For secondary analyses, we classified cases into subtypes
by IOP and by VF loss pattern at diagnosis. We defined sub-
types of high-tension (n = 997; 651 and 346 of NHS and HPFS
participants, respectively) and normal-tension POAG (n = 486;
349 and 137 of NHS and HPFS participants, respectively) as
those with a maximum untreated IOP of 22 mm Hg or higher
or less than 22 mm Hg, respectively. We defined subtypes by
VF loss pattern: those with peripheral VF loss only (n = 835;
576 and 259 of NHS and HPFS participants, respectively) or
earlyparacentralVFloss(n = 433;288and145ofNHSandHPFS
participants, respectively) or undetermined VF loss (n = 215;
136 and 79 of NHS and HPFS participants, respectively) with a
previously described method.49 For a case with peripheral VF
loss only, nasal step, temporal wedge, or Bjerrum scotoma was
present with no paracentral loss. For a case with early para-
central loss, there was paracentral loss only or paracentral loss
with VF loss in the Bjerrum area and/or nasal step area in the
same hemifield but without any temporal wedge loss. We in-
cluded the latter paracentral group because those with only
paracentral loss were uncommon (approximately 21%),
whereas those with clear paracentral loss frequently also had
peripheral loss. Cases (n = 215) with undetermined VF loss (ie,
VF loss in the paracentral and any temporal wedge regions in
the same eye or paracentral loss in 1 hemifield with periph-
eral loss only in the other hemifield) were censored. The pro-
portionofthosewithnormal-tensionPOAGwas38.3%inthose
with early paracentral VF loss and 28.8% in those with periph-
eral VF loss only.
Measurement of Intake of Nitrate and Vegetable Sources
of Nitrate
ValidatedSFFQswereadministeredevery2to4years.The1984
NHS SFFQ included 116 items, and similar versions were used
from 1986 in the NHS (126 items) and HPFS (131 items). The
SFFQ inquires about the average intake of a serving of a food
or beverage in the preceding year, with intake choices from
never or less than 1 per month to 6 or more per day. To con-
vert responses into average daily intakes of nitrate, nutrient
content information of each food obtained from updated US
Department of Agriculture food composition50 was used and
combined with frequency information.
Forprimaryanalyses,weexamineddailyintakeofnitrateand
vegetables. Vegetables included celery and others in 4 groups:
green leafy vegetables (iceberg lettuce; romaine lettuce; kale,
mustard, or chard; cooked spinach; and raw spinach), crucifer-
ousvegetables(kale,mustard,orchard;broccoli;cabbageorcole-
slaw;cauliflower;andBrusselssprouts),rootvegetables(beets,
potatoes,onions,carrots,yamsorsweetpotatoes),andtomato-
based foods (tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato juice).
We evaluated updated cumulatively averaged intakes,
which better represent long-term exposure and have less ran-
dom measurement error.51 With cumulative averaging, the av-
erage of all available information was used (eg, in the NHS in
1984, the 1984 nitrate value was used; in 1986, the average of
the 1984 and 1986 values was used). Intakes of other dietary
factors (eg, other antioxidants, caffeine, alcohol, folate, or fla-
vonoids) were similarly derived.
Validity of SFFQ Assessment of Nitrate
and Vegetable Sources
The reproducibility and validity of the SFFQ have been re-
ported previously.52,53 In a biomarker study54 among 630 par-
ticipants, being in the highest tertile of dietary nitrate intake
based on the SFFQ was associated with a 3.18-mmol/L in-
crease in plasma nitrate (P = .1). In 127 participants who com-
pleted both the SFFQ and multiple weighed dietary records,55
the SFFQ performed reasonably well, with a mean correla-
tion with dietary record values of 0.46 across vegetables: from
0.25 for kale, mustard, or chard greens to 0.73 for lettuce.
Statistical Analysis

adjusted using the residual method.56 For food analyses, we

week), number of eye examinations reported during follow-
up, multivitamin use, and, among women, age at menopause
and postmenopausal hormone use. In addition, main multi-
variable models (model 1) included other dietary compo-
nents: cumulatively updated intake categories of total calo-
ries, alcohol, and caffeine. In additional multivariable models
(model 2), we further adjusted for intake of folate, vitamin A,
and antioxidants (alpha carotene, beta carotene, beta crypto-
xanthin,lycopene,luteinorzeaxanthin,othercarotenoids,fla-
vonoids, and vitamins C and E).
We analyzed cohort-specific data separately and per-
formed tests for heterogeneity to check for appropriateness of
pooling the results. We then pooled the results using meta-
analytic methods that incorporated random effects.58
Secondary Analyses
We performed several secondary analyses. First, we evalu-
ated nitrate intake only as of baseline or as of the most recent
questionnaire. Second, we separately analyzed the risks of
high- vs normal-tension POAG and POAG with peripheral VF
loss only vs early paracentral loss. When testing whether the
associations between nitrate and 1 POAG subtype are differ-
ent from those with another subtype, we combined the data
sets into 1, then conducted Cox proportional hazards regres-
sion analyses that further stratified on the 2 cohorts (to allow
for differing hazard functions) and used the Lunn-McNeil
approach59 to derive the P for heterogeneity.
Results
During1678713person-yearsoffollow-up,weidentified1483in-
cidentcases.Themean(SD)ageforthe1483caseswas66.8(8.3).
Highest consumers of dietary nitrate consumed more antioxi-
dants(carotenoids,vitaminC,vitaminE),flavonoids,folate,and
vitamin A; exercised more; and were more frequently African
American(Table1).Theywerealsoleanerandsmokedless.These
differences were adjusted for in multivariable analyses.
In nitrate analyses, cohort-specific results were not
heterogeneous and thus were pooled. Age-adjusted and mul-
tivariable analyses revealed similar associations (Table 2).

mately 80 mg/d of nitrate, the pooled multivariable relative
risk (MVRR) of POAG in the main model (model 1) was 0.81
(95% CI, 0.69-0.96) for quintile 2, 0.88 (95% CI, 0.75-1.04)
for quintile 3, 0.90 (95% CI, 0.66-1.23) for quintile 4, and 0.79
(95% CI, 0.66-0.93) for quintile 5 (P for trend = .02) (Table 2).
When other dietary factors (model 2) were also adjusted for,
similar inverse associations were observed (pooled MVRR for
quintile 5 vs quintile 1, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52-0.85; P for
trend = .01).
When we explored the timing of intake, no association was
found between nitrate intake only at baseline and intake at the
most recent SFFQ (pooled MVRR for model 1, 0.88; 95% CI,
0.74-1.04; P for trend = .21 for baseline intake and 0.91; 95%
CI, 0.76-1.09; P for trend = .13 for most recent intake for quin-
tile 5 compared with quintile 1).
When nitrate intake with POAG subtypes characterized by
IOP at diagnosis was evaluated (Table 3), we observed similar
associations, and the P for heterogeneity was .75. However, we
observed differences (P for heterogeneity = .01) in associa-
tions by VF subtypes (pooled MVRR for POAG with periph-
eral VF loss only, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.68-1.06; P for trend = .50;
pooled MVRR for POAG with early paracentral VF loss, 0.56;

a Intake calculated using cumulative average (ie, average of all available intake
data from food frequency questionnaires completed before each 2-year
period at risk).
bAll multivariable analyses were stratified by age in months and period at risk,
and they were adjusted for the following variables: ancestry (African
American, non-African heritage); family history of glaucoma; self-reported
history of hypertension; diabetes; body mass index (22-23, 24-25, 26-27,
28-29, and �30); cumulatively averaged intakes of total energy (kilocalories
per day in quintiles); alcohol (grams per day in categories of 0-4, 5-14, 15-29,
and �30 g/d); and caffeine (milligrams per day in quintiles); pack-years of
smoking (1-9, 10-19, 20-29, and �30 pack-years); physical activity (quartiles of
metabolic equivalent hours per week); number of eye examinations reported
during follow-up; multivitamin use (nonuser, past user, or current user), and in
the Nurses’Health Study only, they were additionally adjusted for age at
menopause (20-44, 45-50, 50-54, �54 years) and postmenopausal hormone
status (premenopausal, current user, past user, or nonuser).
c Includes all variables in model 1 with additional adjustment for other nutrients:
quintiles of alpha carotene, beta carotene, beta cryptoxanthin, lycopene,
lutein or zeaxanthin, other carotenoids, folate, flavonoid, and vitamins A, C,
and E.
dPooled results were calculated using DerSimonian and Laird methods with
random effects; P for heterogeneity >.05 between cohorts for all P values for
linear trend results.
e Baseline diet refers to diet as of 1984 in women and 1986 in men; most recent
diet refers to the intake as of the food frequency questionnaire immediately
before each 2-year period at risk.

average (ie, average of all available
intake data from food frequency
questionnaires completed before
each 2-year period at risk).
bTo test whether the associations
between nitrate and 1 POAG
subtype is significantly different
from those with another subtype,
we combined the 2 data sets into 1,
then conducted Cox regression
analyses that stratified on the
2 cohorts, which allowed for the
baseline hazard function to be
different in the cohorts; we then
used the Lunn-McNeil approach59
to test for heterogeneity in
associations and derived the P for
heterogeneity.

IOP at diagnosis.
dAll multivariable analyses were

f Based on VF loss pattern as of the
earliest reliable VF at diagnosis that
was reproduced at the latest reliable
VF. Cases (n = 216) with advanced
VF loss at diagnosis who could not
be categorized based on initial
presenting VF loss as either
peripheral VF loss only or early
paracentral VF loss were censored
during analyses. See the Methods
section to determine how cases
were categorized according to initial
presenting VF loss.

bKale, mustard, or chard greens were included in both the green leafy
vegetable and cruciferous vegetable categories. Green leafy vegetables
included iceberg lettuce; romaine lettuce; kale, mustard, or chard greens;
cooked spinach; and raw spinach. Cruciferous vegetables included broccoli;
cabbage or coleslaw; cauliflower; kale, mustard, or chard greens; and Brussels
sprouts. Root vegetables included potatoes, beets, onions, carrots, and yams
or sweet potatoes. Tomato-based foods included whole tomatoes, tomato
sauce, and tomato juice.
c The results for women and men were heterogeneous (P for heterogeneity was
.01 for all POAG and.004 for all para-POAG); thus, cohort-specific results are
also provided. For all other food groups, the P for heterogeneity was >.50.

Discussion
Greater intake of dietary nitrate and green leafy vegetables was
associated with a 20% to 30% lower POAG risk; the associa-
tion was particularly strong (40%-50% lower risk) for POAG
with early paracentral VF loss at diagnosis, for which ocular
vascular dysregulation has been implicated.60
Evidence suggests a key role of the NO system in POAG
pathogenesis; alterations of this system may dysregulate ocu-
lar blood flow14,61 and IOP.62-68 Elevated IOP was observed in
a murine POAG model after the gene for soluble guanylate cy-
clase, the NO intracellular receptor, was knocked out.69 Ni-
tric oxide may regulate IOP by mediating aqueous humor out-
flow. In an in vitro study,70 glaucomatous Schlemm canal cells
produced negligible NO after shear stress compared with non-
glaucomatous cells. Thus, exogenous NO donators are emerg-
ing as new glaucoma therapeutics.13
The nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway may be an important al-
ternative source of NO in POAG. One lettuce serving can yield
more NO than that generated daily via the L-arginine–NO
pathway.71 Tissue NO bioavailability and cerebral blood flow
can increase with nitrate salts72,73 and nitrate-rich beet juice
supplementation.74-79 Therefore, dietary nitrate supplemen-
tation represents a practical method to increase NO levels. In-
deed,acrossthe2cross-sectionalstudiesinall(95casesamong
1155 total)45 or only African American (77 cases among 587
total)46womenintheStudyofOsteoporoticFractures,theonly
vegetablethatwasconsistentlyinverselyassociatedwithPOAG
was kale or collard greens: 1 serving or more per month of kale
or collard greens was significantly associated with 55% to 70%
reduced odds of POAG.
The stronger inverse association of POAG with early para-
central VF loss is consistent with evidence that this subtype
is more strongly associated with vascular dysregulation.69,80,81
The blood vessels for the inferior paracentral fibers are in the
maculavulnerabilityzone82andmakemoreacutearcuateturns
than others, creating greater shear forces that could compro-
mise local blood flow.61 In addition, among patients with glau-
coma and autonomic dysfunction or abnormal peripheral mi-
crocirculation, paracentral VF defects were more common80;
one hypothesis is that central fibers may have relatively high
oxygen demand and thus be more vulnerable to vascular
dysregulation.83,84 Furthermore, genetic loci related to the NO
pathway (eg, CAV1/CAV285 [OMIM 601047/601048] and
GUCY1A3/GUCY1B3[OMIM139396/139397]regions69)aremost
stronglyassociatedwithPOAGwithparacentralloss.Thus,fur-
ther studies of exogenous nitrate and POAG with paracentral
VF loss are warranted.
Thiswasalargeprospectivestudywith1483incidentcases
identified from 63 893 women and 41 094 men followed up for
more than 25 years, with high follow-up rates. With repeated
questionnaires, we evaluated nitrate intake and POAG in vari-
ous ways (ie, baseline, recent, and cumulative intake) and con-
trolled for numerous updated POAG risk factors.
Our study had a few limitations. We could not conduct re-
peated eye examinations; consequently, we relied on ques-
tionnaires and medical records for disease confirmation. Our
case ascertainment method had low sensitivity; however,
methodologically, incidence rate ratios can still be valid if the
casedefinitionishighlyspecificandtheascertainmentmethod
is unrelated to exposure.86 Our case definition was highly spe-
cific with the requirement of reproducible VF loss, the case as-
certainment was unlikely to be related to diet, and we re-
quired eye examinations at each follow-up cycle to minimize
bias. Another limitation was residual confounding by other di-
etary factors because nitrate-rich vegetables may have other
nutrients. However, we adjusted for intake of other nutri-
ents, and the inverse associations were robust. We may have
had some misclassification of nitrate intake from errors in par-
ticipants recall and because vegetable nitrate content can vary
bysoilconditions,season,andstorage87,88;however,thesefac-
tors would have biased associations toward the null. In addi-
tion, because both cohorts are more than 90% white, our re-
sults may not be generalizable; however, in a study of African
Americans, kale and collard intake was also associated with a
lower POAG risk.46 Finally, these data represent findings from
the first population-based observational study; thus, the as-
sociation between dietary nitrate consumption and POAG
should be interpreted cautiously and confirmed.
Conclusions
Greater intake of dietary nitrate, an exogenous NO source, was
associated with a lower risk of POAG, particularly POAG with
early paracentral VF loss. These results, if confirmed in obser-
vational and intervention studies, could have important pub-
lic health implications.
