Abstract
Background: For trials to validly evaluate new treatments, comparison against the best existing alternative treatment is essential. We 
reviewed the care provided to women in control arms of breast cancer clinical trials to estimate the proportion consistent with the stan-
dard of care as defined in clinical guidelines. Methods: We analyzed phase III randomized controlled breast cancer trials comparing drug 
treatments with “standard care,” enrolling between 2004 and 2014, and registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. Our primary outcome was the 
proportion of trials in which treatment in the control arm was consistent with concurrent NCCN Guidelines. A secondary analysis assessed 
trials recruiting outside the United States that provided control group therapy not consistent with NCCN Guidelines, comparing them with 
the German Gynecological Oncology Group (AGO) guidelines. We assessed associations between the primary outcome and a priori selected 
trial characteristics. Results: This study included 210 trials that recruited 229,182 women worldwide; 29% of trials (60/210) did not provide 
control group treatment that was consistent with NCCN Guidelines. For trials not recruiting in the United States, results were similar; in 
21% of trials, control arm treatment was inconsistent with both AGO and NCCN Guidelines. Factors significantly associated with offering 
control arm treatment that were inconsistent with guidelines were time period (later trials were less likely to be consistent), breast cancer 
stage and type (trials in early-stage breast cancer and estrogen receptor–negative disease were less likely consistent), and recruitment in 
≥4 countries and recruitment outside the United States. Conclusions: To ensure that clinical trials achieve their goal of obtaining the best 
information to guide patient treatment, the question of how investigators chose and describe “standard care” for control arm participants 
warrants further investigation.

Clinical trials are carefully designed and expensive ex-
periments. It is scientifically and ethically important 
that these trials, which help define best practice for fu-
ture patients, are well designed to clearly delineate the 
place of a new treatment alongside current standard 
practice. Without careful attention to trial design, in-
cluding an appropriate control arm comparator, trials 
may produce misleading results and waste research re-
sources.1

Concerns have been raised about the use of inappro-
priate comparators in clinical trials.2,3 An inappropriate 
comparator, such as a drug or dose that is less effective 
than standard treatment, may result in a new treatment 
appearing more effective than it really is.4 Another 
type of inappropriate comparator is one that may not 
be inferior, but is not proven or accepted as standard 
care, which will result in outcomes that are difficult 
to interpret and implement in the context of multiple

standards across multiple trials. Inconsistency in 
choice of control arm undermines the quality of evi-
dence generated by clinical trials, which in turn im-
pacts systematic reviews, the development of clinical 
practice guidelines (CPGs), and planning of future 
trials. 
The Declaration of Helsinki emphasizes that 
the “benefits, risks, burdens, and effectiveness of a 
new method should be tested against those of the 
best current prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeu-
tic methods.”5 High-quality CPGs should represent 
a reliable source of information about best current 
practice and serve as a benchmark for standard care 
at the time they are written. As such, CPGs may 
help inform the design of control arms of random-
ized trials that seek to advance that benchmark. An 
example of high-quality CPGs for cancer treatment 
are the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in On-
cology (NCCN Guidelines), which are continuously 
updated to reflect new data.6 They are used exten-
sively by clinicians in the United States and other 
countries, including China, Japan, Latin American, 
the Middle East, and Africa. 
To determine the proportion of randomized clini-
cal trials (RCTs) that use an appropriate comparator, 
we investigated phase III RCTs testing a drug inter-
vention against standard care. We assessed how many 
of these trials provided control groups that adhered to 
standard care in the concurrent NCCN Guidelines. 
Worldwide, breast cancer is the most commonly re-
searched cancer, accounting for the highest propor-
tion of clinical trials,7 and therefore is an ideal group 
to analyze consistency of control arm care.
Specifically, we aimed to estimate the propor-
tion of phase III RCTs of novel drug regimens for 
breast cancer in which control group participants 
received treatment at the time of trial initiation 
that was consistent with the NCCN Guidelines for 
Breast Cancer, and to explore heterogeneity accord-
ing to prespecified subgroups, including time period, 
location, industry sponsorship, type of subjects, and 
treatments tested. 
Methods
Our search strategy used the following fields in the 
advanced search engine of ClinicalTrials.gov: re-
cruitment: “all studies”; study results: “all studies”; 
study type: “interventional studies”; condition: 
“breast cancer”; gender: “studies with female partici-
pants”; age group: “adult and senior”; “phase III”; and 
“first received from 01/01/2004 to 01/01/2014.” The 
data fields from this search were then exported from 
ClinicalTrials.gov into Microsoft Excel. 
A Microsoft Access database was used to collect 
the information required for this study. Each trial 
was required to meet 5 inclusion criteria: (1) studied 
women with breast cancer, (2) was a phase III RCT, 
(3) recruited patients from any countries in the 
world, (4) the control arm used drugs to treat breast 
cancer (chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and/or 
targeted therapy), and (5) the trial was first received 
(first registered) by ClinicalTrials.gov between Janu-
ary 1, 2004, and January 1, 2014. 
We used the NCCN Guidelines for Breast Can-
cer to determine whether the control group received 
the standard of care. There were 24 relevant NCCN 
Guidelines in the period of this study from 2004 to 
2014. Treatment given in the control arm of each 
trial was compared with the standard of care as de-
fined by the NCCN Guideline corresponding to the 
trial start date on ClinicalTrials.gov. Control arms 
were categorized as including chemotherapy, endo-
crine therapy, and/or targeted therapy. The control 
arm was then defined as either “standard” or “not 
standard” according to whether it used the NCCN-
recommended chemotherapy, endocrine thera-
py, and/or targeted therapy. The control arm was 
deemed standard if it matched either the NCCN 
“preferred regimen” or “other regimen.” The control 
arm was determined to be “standard” if both the drug 
dose and schedule matched the NCCN Guidelines 
recommendations. Trials were categorized as “not 
standard” if they were not included in the recom-
mendations listed by the NCCN Guidelines (see 
supplemental eTable 1; available with this article at 
JNCCN.org). Trials that included both estrogen re-
ceptor (ER)–positive and ER-negative disease were 
trials of chemotherapy or targeted therapies, thus 
we used the NCCN Guidelines regarding the use of 
these treatment types. The control group of some 
RCTs tested more than one type of drug treatment 
(eg, chemotherapy and targeted therapy) and all 
drug treatments tested in the trial needed to match 
the NCCN Guideline recommendations to be con-
sidered standard. In trials with multiple control 
arms, all arms had to satisfy the above criteria to con-
fer a designation of “standard.” Two authors (R.F.D.,

M.B.B.) independently extracted data from half 
of the trials each. To ensure consistency, first they 
separately extracted data for the same 20 trials and 
compared results; there was >90% concordance with 
the data fields collected. Differences were discussed 
and resolved to further standardize assessments made 
about each trial.
The primary outcome assessed was the proportion 
of trials whose control arm was consistent with stan-
dard of care defined by the NCCN Guidelines. In the 
context of breast cancer care, although the NCCN 
Guidelines are the most widely used internationally, 
evidence-based guidelines are also produced by the 
German Gynecological Oncology Group (AGO) 
that overall reflect a European (vs United States) per-
spective on breast cancer management.8,9 To allow for 
this variation in clinical practice, we therefore con-
ducted a secondary analysis of trials recruiting outside 
the United States that provided control group thera-
py not consistent with NCCN Guidelines, comparing 
them with the AGO guidelines. 
Using Pearson’s chi-square tests and a modified 
Poisson regression approach, we assessed the associa-
tion between the primary outcome and the variables 
including year of trial start, industry sponsorship, use 
of blinding, extent of breast cancer, HER2 receptor 
status, ER status, therapy type, number of countries of 
recruitment, and whether the trial was recruiting in 
the United States.10 All variables were included in the 
Poisson model, which provided estimated prevalence 
ratios. Pearson’s chi-square and Fisher exact tests were 
used to assess association among the subgroups de-
fined by type of treatment in the control arm: chemo-
therapy, endocrine therapy, or targeted therapy. We 
used Fisher exact test if >20% of the expected counts 
in a table were <5. We described reasons why the con-
trol group was not deemed standard.
Results
Study Population
A total of 715 trials were extracted from ClinicalTri-
als.gov. Of these, 500 did not meet inclusion criteria, 
most because they did not use a drug intervention 
(80%; 400/500). Trials may have been excluded for 
more than one reason (Figure 1).
Characteristics of the 215 eligible trials are de-
tailed in Table 1. The largest proportion of trials 
started between 2008 and 2011, and almost half were 
sponsored by industry. Most trials did not use blinding. 
Half were in the setting of metastatic breast cancer, 
almost one-quarter included only HER2-positive dis-
ease, and almost one-third included only ER-positive 
breast cancer. Most trials were only recruiting in one 
country, with 40% recruiting in the United States. 
Of the 215 randomized breast cancer trials that 
met inclusion criteria, 210 were eligible for analysis; 
5 trials were excluded because blinding, number of 
countries of recruitment, or recruitment in the Unit-
ed States was missing (Figure 1).
Analysis
Most trials (71%; 150/210) provided control group 
care consistent with contemporaneous NCCN 
Guidelines, but almost one-third of randomized 
breast cancer trials (29%; 60/210) did not (Table 
2). In total, there were 68,784 patients enrolled in 
trials that were not offering control group care con-
sistent with the guidelines. In comparison, there 
were 160,398 patients enrolled in trials that had 
control group care consistent with the guidelines.
Results of our univariate model are shown in Ta-
ble 2 and Figure 2. Factors that remained significantly 
consistent with NCCN Guidelines in the multivari-
able model were the trial start date, extent of breast 
cancer, ER status, number of countries of recruit-
ment, and whether there was trial recruitment in the 
United States (Table 2, Figure 3). It was less likely 
for the control arm to be consistent in trials that be-
gan in 2012–2014, involved women with early-stage 
breast cancer, involved ≥4 countries of recruitment, 
or if the trial was not recruiting in the United States 
(Table 2, Figure 3). Randomized breast cancer trials

that included ER-positive disease were more likely to 
use control arms consistent with the guidelines.
The most common reason that a control arm 
regimen was inconsistent was because it was not 
included in the NCCN Guidelines (58%; 35/60). 
The remaining trials (42%; 25/60) used a regimen 
available in the NCCN Guidelines but not at the 
standard dose and/or schedule (supplemental eTable 
1). The recommended dose was not used in 15 trials 
 
(25%); of these, 7 trials used lower-than-recom-
mended doses (Table 3). These 7 trials proposed to 
enroll a total of 3,440 patients.
Among trials recruiting in the United States, 
the control arm was not considered standard in 11 
of 83 (13%)—a much lower proportion than the 
overall cohort (60/210; 29%) (Table 4). Of these 
11 trials, 6 used control arm care that was not in 
the NCCN Guidelines. For example, in Clinical-
Trials.gov identifier NCT00320385, which enrolled 
women with HER2-positive metastatic breast can-
cer previously treated with trastuzumab, the in-
tervention was trastuzumab and lapatinib and the 
control was lapatinib monotherapy at 1,500 mg 
orally daily; lapatinib monotherapy is not recom-
mended in the guidelines. NCCN Guidelines rec-
ommend combination with capecitabine chemo-
therapy, which is consistent with RCT evidence.11 
Another 5 trials used a different dose and/or sched-
ule from the NCCN Guidelines. For example, in 
trial NCT00193726, which enrolled women with 
metastatic breast cancer, the intervention arm 
was combination chemotherapy (doxorubicin and 
docetaxel) and the control arm was docetaxel, 75 
mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 cycled every 21 days. 
The NCCN Guidelines recommend single-agent 
docetaxel at a dose of 80 to 100 mg/m2 intravenous-
ly day 1 cycled every 21 days (see Table 3). 
A higher proportion of trials that recruited ex-
clusively outside of the United States were not con-
sistent with the NCCN Guidelines (39%; 49/127) 
versus 11 of 83 trials (13%) recruiting in the Unit-
ed States (Table 4). Of the 49 trials not consistent 
with NCCN Guidelines and not recruiting in the 
United States, 15 were consistent with the contem-
poraneous AGO guidelines and 34 were not. There-
fore, for 45 of 210 trials in total (21%), the con-
trol arm was not consistent with either guideline, 
allowing for compliance with the AGO guidelines 
for trials recruiting exclusively outside the Unit-
ed States. The 15 trials that were consistent with 
AGO, but not NCCN Guidelines, were all in early-
stage breast cancer. Of these, 9 used a control group 
of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by a 
taxane (either paclitaxel or docetaxel). The point 
of discordance with the NCCN Guidelines was 
the choice of anthracycline combined with cyclo-
phosphamide before a taxane; NCCN recommends 
doxorubicin rather than epirubicin in this regimen.

The remaining 6 AGO-consistent/NCCN-noncon-
sistent trials involved adjuvant endocrine therapy; 
2 used a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) 
agonist and tamoxifen in premenopausal women, 
and 4 used tamoxifen in postmenopausal women. 
A GnRH agonist with tamoxifen is included in the 
AGO guidelines for premenopausal women with 
early-stage breast cancer; the NCCN Guidelines 
recommend tamoxifen alone. The AGO guide-
lines recommend either tamoxifen or an aromatase 
inhibitor (AI) for postmenopausal women with 
early-stage breast cancer; the NCCN Guidelines 
recommend an AI unless there are specific contra-
indications to this class of medication. 
Discussion
Statement of Key Findings
Although appropriate comparators in RCTs have 
been the subject of comment and concern for some 
time, this is the first study to address this question 
empirically using a large set of trials over a long pe-
riod. In cancer trials, which account for the highest 
proportion of registered clinical trials on ClinicalTri-
als.gov, approximately one-third (29%) of phase III

trials between 2004 and 2014 did not use a control 
arm consistent with the relevant NCCN Guidelines. 
It was less likely for the control arm to be con-
sistent with NCCN Guidelines if the trial was not 
recruiting in the United States, recruited in ≥4 coun-
tries, began between 2012 and 2014, or if the trial 
involved women with early-stage breast cancer. Tri-
als recruiting exclusively outside the United States 
were more likely to have a control arm not consis-
tent with NCCN Guidelines. Of those, most were 
also not consistent with a major European guideline 
(the AGO guidelines). Trials including women with 
ER-positive breast cancer were more likely to be 
consistent with the guidelines. 
An important distinction must be made between 
standard care in clinical practice and clinical trials. 
In the clinic, each patient will have a specific set of 
factors that influence treatment, such as age, perfor-
mance status, and comorbidities. In this situation, 
it is appropriate to consider a range of acceptable 
treatment options and apply them to the patient’s 
circumstances. In contrast, clinical trials have strict 
protocols covering all aspects of patient recruit-
ment, randomization, follow-up, and assessment of 
outcome; this is essential to ensure quality results. 
This robust framework must extend to selection of 
the control arm to enable valid comparison with the 
intervention arm. Ethically, it is also crucial that 
patients entering clinical trials receive the most ap-
propriate standard of care; patients who donate their 
time and energy to advance clinical knowledge for 
others deserve no less. 
Study Strengths and Limitations
An important strength of our study is that we used 
a large set of clinical trials conducted over a period 
of 10 years to test our research questions. Trials reg-
istered with ClinicalTrials.gov constitute the largest 
proportion of trials on the WHO International Clin-
ical Trials Registry Platform12 (77%), and therefore 
it is likely that the breast cancer clinical trials are 
representative of trials internationally. 
An additional strength is that we were able to 
make a meaningful comparison of trials registered 
with a US-based registry (ClinicalTrials.gov) and 
the US-developed NCCN Guidelines. The NCCN 
Guidelines are the most commonly used oncology 
guidelines in the world, are readily available on the 
NCCN Web site, and are the only guidelines to be 
updated multiple times per year using a robust and 
transparent process. Although concerns have been

raised about the quality of CPGs,13–16 conflicts of in-
terest are declared in the NCCN Guidelines and ev-
ery effort is made to ensure that evidence-based and 
consensus-based recommendations are documented. 
Worldwide, there are regional variations in on-
cology practice that may be due to the use of local 
guidelines. To allow for this variation, we also com-
pared control arm treatment in trials not recruiting 
in the United States with the major European on-
cology guidelines. There remained 45 of 210 trials 
(21%) that were not consistent with either guideline. 
We stringently compared therapy offered to con-
trol group participants with therapy recommended 
by the NCCN Guidelines so we could objectively 
and reliably apply our reference standard to all trials 
assessed. We acknowledge that there are some sce-
narios in which trialists may consider this too strin-
gent. One scenario is trials that compare 2 regimens 
with different agents but that need to control for the 
duration of the regimen. For example, in the Hellen-
ic Cooperative Oncology Group trial (ClinicalTri-
als.gov identifier: NCT00431080), the control group 
used 4 cycles each of FEC (5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, 
and cyclophosphamide) and docetaxel rather than 
the standard 3 cycles, so it could be compared fairly

followed by dose-dense paclitaxel for 4 cycles. An-
other scenario is exemplified by trial NCT00320385, 
wherein it might be considered reasonable to use a 
control arm of lapatinib alone rather than the stan-
dard lapatinib/capecitabine when comparing it with 
combination trastuzumab/lapatinib, because this tri-
al was testing a chemotherapy-free strategy. The final 
example is illustrated in trial NCT00938652, which 
compared a control arm of carboplatin/gemcitabine 
versus this combination plus iniparib in metastatic 
triple-negative breast cancer; although carboplatin/
gemcitabine was not included as a standard regimen 
in the relevant NCCN Guidelines, this may be con-
sidered a reasonable control group given that the in-
tervention was testing iniparib with DNA-damaging 
chemotherapy. However, we argue that even minor 
deviations from guidelines increase the difficulty of 
combining data across trials in systematic reviews 
and meta-analyses, and, like all deviations, poten-
tially undermine the research evidence base gener-
ated by ongoing clinical trials.17  
Despite this analysis, we acknowledge that all 
trials conducted globally cannot be expected to fol-
low US or European guidelines, because different

pharmacogenomic profiles of patient populations 
may influence toxicities locally. Using a “nonstan-
dard” regimen may be reasonable in this circum-
stance, although the results would not be generaliz-
able to other patient populations.
Some readers may question the choice of NCCN 
Guidelines as our reference standard for defining 
standard care for the control arms in the trials we 
assessed. We searched for guidance about how con-
trol group care should be chosen in RCTs and were 
surprised to find little available, although the impor-
tance of a fair comparator is widely acknowledged.

are preferred over placebo trials (for ethical and sci-
entific reasons). Investigators are advised that active 
care must be given to appropriate patients, at ap-
propriate doses, and at an appropriate schedule to be 
interpretable and provide fair comparisons, but it is 
unclear how such judgements should be determined. 
We therefore think the NCCN Guidelines represent 
the best reference standard for appropriate care for 
the comparator arms of cancer clinical trials that 
we could have chosen. Of note, it is clear from our 
study that more careful study and guidance on how 
to choose appropriate comparators for active care tri-
als would be very valuable to future investigators.
Conclusions
Our results raise serious concerns regarding the fact 
that almost 30% of contemporary breast cancer RCTs 
may be using an inappropriate comparator in the 
provision of “standard care” to control arm partici-
pants. Inappropriate comparators that deviate from 
best available care threaten the internal validity and 
applicability of the results of randomized trials. As 
such, they waste research resources, compromise the 
quality of future clinical guidelines, and potentially 
undermine clinical care and patient outcomes. That 
approximately one-third of breast cancer clinical tri-
als may be flawed in this way is, we believe, unac-
ceptable and requires urgent action. Trialists must 
ensure care offered to control arm participants is 
consistent with up-to-date, high-quality guidelines, 
or, if they plan to offer care that is inconsistent with 
guidelines, their choice needs to be clearly justified 
and described to the patients recruited to the trial.
