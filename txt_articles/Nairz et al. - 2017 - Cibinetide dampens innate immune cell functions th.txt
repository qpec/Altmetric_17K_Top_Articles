Two distinct forms of the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) mediate the cellular responses to 
erythropoietin (EPO) in different tissues. EPOR homodimers signal to promote the maturation of 
erythroid progenitor cells. In other cell types, including immune cells, EPOR and the ß-common 
receptor (CD131) form heteromers (the innate repair receptor; IRR), and exert tissue protective 
effects. We used dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) to induce colitis in C57BL/6 N mice. Once colitis was 
established, mice were treated with solvent, EPO or the selective IRR agonist cibinetide. We found 
that both cibinetide and EPO ameliorated the clinical course of experimental colitis in mice, resulting 
in improved weight gain and survival. Correspondingly, DSS-exposed mice treated with cibinetide or 
EPO displayed preserved tissue integrity due to reduced infiltration of myeloid cells and diminished 
production of pro-inflammatory disease mediators including cytokines, chemokines and nitric 
oxide synthase-2. Experiments using LPS-activated primary macrophages revealed that the anti-
inflammatory effects of cibinetide were dependent on CD131 and JAK2 functionality and were mediated 
via inhibition of NF-κ
B subunit p65 activity. Cibinetide activation of the IRR exerts potent anti-
inflammatory effects, especially within the myeloid population, reduces disease activity and mortality 
in mice. Cibinetide thus holds promise as novel disease-modifying therapeutic of inflammatory bowel 
disease.
Erythropoietin (EPO) is a type I cytokine that fulfills dual functions. In its classical endocrine role, EPO produced 
by the kidney acts as the key regulator of erythropoiesis via inhibition of erythroid progenitor cell apoptosis and 
stimulation of differentiation1,2. Additionally, locally-produced EPO mediates extra-erythropoietic activity in 
non-hematopoietic cells and tissues3. Accordingly, basic research has characterized EPO as a tissue-protective and 
anti-apoptotic cytokine in animal models of ischemia, ischemia-reperfusion injury or mechanical trauma in various 
tissues including the nervous system, retina, myocardium, lung, kidney, liver or transplanted pancreatic islets4–12. 
Moreover, it has been shown that EPO ameliorates disease activity in experimental arthritis, encephalomyelitis 
and colitis in mice, suggesting that EPO exerts anti-inflammatory and tissue protective effects in autoimmune 
diseases13–16.
These pleiotropic effects of EPO are transduced by two different receptor isoforms3. The erythropoietic 
response to EPO is initiated via a receptor formed by two identical EPO receptor (EPOR) subunits, which medi-
ate Janus kinase-2 (JAK2)-dependent activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-5 (STAT5)17. 
STAT5 subsequently translocates to the nucleus to regulate hemoglobin (Hb) synthesis, control cell cycle progres-
sion and inhibit the apoptosis of erythroid progenitors18,19. In parallel to the STAT5 pathway, EPOR homodimers 
activate mitogen-activated kinases (MAPKs) and nuclear factor (NF)-κ
B20. In contrast, the anti-apoptotic and

anti-inflammatory effects of EPO are transduced via an alternative receptor composed of subunits EPOR and 
CD131, the beta common receptor shared by granulocyte macrophage (GM)-CSF, interleukin (IL)−
3 and IL-521, 
also termed the innate repair receptor (IRR). Activation of the IRR is paracrine in nature, requiring high local 
concentrations of EPO, yet facilitates similar signal transduction events including STAT5 and MAPK activation. 
The effects of IRR activation on NF-kB function are diverse and may be dependent on the experimental model or 
cell type studied. For example, EPO protected cultured cerebrocortical neurons form excytotoxic and nitrosative 
stress through activation of JAK2 and NF-κ
B, resulting in increased expression of anti-apoptotic gene products4. 
In contrast, in vivo models of myocardial and hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury have shown that EPO treat-
ment protected from tissue damage via inhibition of NF-κ
B activation10,22. Similarly, sensitization to chemother-
apeutics by EPO in vitro involved the inhibition of both JAK2 and NF-κ
B23.
Cibinetide (also termed ARA290 or pyroglutamate helix B surface peptide (pHBSP)), is a synthetic 
oligo-peptide rationally designed to selectively activate the IRR24. Cibinetide interacts with the external hydro-
philic domain of the EPOR/CD131 complex and has been shown to exert benefical effects in animal models 
of myocardial infarction, dilated cardiomyopathy, experimental ischemic stroke, peripheral nerve trauma and 
wound healing. Furthermore, randomized placebo controlled trials have demonstrated its safety and efficacy in 
human subjects affected by peripheral neuropathy secondary to sarcoidosis or diabetes mellitus25–27. Cibinetide 
improves symptoms in patients with sarcoidosis-associated small nerve fiber loss and increases corneal small 
nerve fiber abundance.
Cibinetide lacks erythropoietic effects as it does not activate EPOR homodimers. Correspondingly, unchanged 
Hb levels have been reported following repeated applications of cibinetide in patients. Thus, cibinetide is not 
associated with unintended side effects such as thromboembolism secondary to stimulation of erythropoiesis as 
ascribed for full length recombinant erythropoietin.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic potential of cibinetide in the model of experimen-
tal DSS-colitis and to investigate possible mechanisms that mediate its immuno-modulatory effects. We report 
that cibinetide had multiform anti-inflammatory properties in inflamed tissues. While cibinetide did not affect 
erythropoiesis, it reduced the influx of myeloid cells into the lamina propria and inhibited the local production 
and systemic availability of TNF, IL-6, IL12/IL-23, myeloid derived chemokines and nitric oxide (NO) in mice 
suffering from DSS colitis. Mechanistically, these effects of cibinetide were transduced via CD131 and JAK2 sign-
aling which resulted in impaired activation of the NF-κ
B subunit p65 thereby blocking transcriptional activation 
of NF-κ
B driven inflammatory mediators. Consequently, cibinetide exerted beneficial effects in DSS-colitis by 
improving disease activity and survival, recommending cibinetide as a promising therapy for human inflamma-
tory bowel disease.
Results
Cibinetide ameliorates the clinical course of dextran sulphate sodium-induced colitis. 
Full 
length EPO has anti-inflammatory effects in a model of inflammatory bowel disease, namely DSS-colitis, that 
are mediated via NF-κ
B de-activation16. We thus questioned whether this effect depended on IRR activation by 
determining whether the specific IRR agonist cibinetide improved DSS-colitis, where pathophysiology and tissue 
damage are centrally driven by NF-κ
B regulated pathways. C57BL/6N mice were therefore administered 3% DSS 
via the oral route for 7 days (days 1 to 7). From day 8 to 14, mice had ad libitum access to drinking water and were 
injected intraperitoneally daily with either EPO, cibinetide or an equal volume of PBS (solvent).
In comparison to DSS-exposed mice treated with solvent, animals receiving either EPO or cibinetide presented 
with a significantly improved weight gain (Fig. 1A). Expectedly, EPO-treated animals exhibited increased hemo-
globin (Hb) levels (Fig. 1B), whereas cibinetide treatment did not result in such erythropoietic activity in vivo or 
in vitro. Specifically, EPO but not cibinetide stimulated the differentiation of murine erythropoietic progenitors 
(for gating strategy see Supplementary Fig. S1A) in the bone marrow in vivo (Supplementary Fig. S1B–S1G) 
and increased Hb protein and CD71 mRNA levels in human mononuclear cell cultures (Supplementary Fig. S1H 
and S1I). Cibinetide prevented the occurrence of anemia in DSS-exposed mice (Fig. 1B), possibly by reducing 
intestinal bleeding as evident from reduced fecal Hb content (Fig. 1C). Importantly, lethality was also signifi-
cantly lower in the EPO and cibinetide treatment groups, respectively (Fig. 1D). Correspondingly, histopathologic 
changes as quantified by a colitis score28 and immune cell tissue invasion/mucosal thickening were significantly 
and similarly reduced in colitis mice treated with EPO or cibinetide (Fig. 1E and F–H).
Cibinetide inhibits immune cell influx into the colonic lamina propria. 
Flow cytometric character-
ization of immune cells (for gating strategies see Supplementary Fig. S2A, S2B and S3A) infiltrating the lamina 
propria in response to DSS showed that treatment with EPO or cibinetide resulted in reduced accumulation of 
neutrophils, monocytes and eosinophils in the colon (Fig. 2A–C). In addition, we noted a significant reduction in 
CD4+ T cell numbers expressing either IFN-γ
 or IL-17A in the colon of mice having received EPO or cibinetide 
as compared to control treated littermates (Fig. 2E and F). A substantial reduction of TNF positivity was found in 
myeloid cells, especially of Ly-6C+ monocytes and CD11b+ CD11c−macrophages (Fig. 2G and H) but not in the 
CD4+ T cell population (Fig. 2D). In addition, either population of myeloid cells displayed reduced intracellular 
Nos2 staining in the EPO and cibinetide treatment groups (Supplementary Fig. S2C and S2D). No change was 
observed in intralesional numbers of CD11c+ DC (Supplementary Fig. S2E), mast cells (Supplementary Fig. S2F), 
IL-10+ CD4+ T, CD8+ T or B cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B, S3C and S3D, respectively).
Lamina propria macrophages express the innate repair receptor and respond to cibi-
netide. 
Next, we FAC-sorted CD11b+ CD11c− lamina propria macrophages and found constitutive expres-
sion of Epor mRNA (Fig. 3A). CD131 mRNA expression was increased by DSS-induced inflammation, while 
treatment with EPO or cibinetide inhibited this effect (Fig. 3B). In addition, we observed reduced p65 binding

activity in sorted CD11b+ CD11c− lamina propria macrophages from DSS-exposed mice treated with EPO or 
cibinetide as compared to cells from solvent treated littermates (Fig. 3C).
Cibinetide acts on myeloid cells and inhibits the production of soluble disease mediators. 
In 
line with these results, FAC-sorting of macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells and CD4+ T cells from the lamina 
propria of DSS-exposed mice revealed that EPO and cibinetide both substantially reduced Ccl2, Ccl3, Ccl11, TNF, 
IL-1ß and IL-6 production by myeloid cells, but had only little effect on respective cytokine/chemokine expres-
sions by CD4+ T cells (Fig. 4A–F). The observed clinical and histopathological improvement of colitis upon EPO 
or cibinetide treatment was also associated with reduced levels of nitrite, TNF, IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-12p70, IL-23, IFN-γ
 
and IL-17A in supernatants of colonic organ cultures (Supplementary Fig. S4A–S4E). Corresponding results were 
found upon determination of cytokine and chemokine mRNA levels in colonic tissue samples from control and 
DSS mice demonstrating an inhibitory effect of EPO or cibinetide on the expression of several pro-inflammatory 
immune mediators (Supplementary Table 1).
CD131 is necessary for macrophages to respond to cibinetide. 
We next generated BMDMs from 
WT and CD131−
/− mice and treated cells with EPO or cibinetide followed by stimulation with the TLR4 ligand 
LPS. We found that both, EPO and cibinetide, significantly reduced concentrations of Ccl2, TNF, IL-1ß and IL-6 
in culture supernatants of LPS-stimulated WT BMDMs, but both compounds failed to affect cytokine concentra-
tions in the absence of CD131 (Fig. 5A–D).
Cibinetide acts on JAK2 and PI3 kinase and inhibits p65 activation. 
Moreover, pre-treatment 
of LPS-stimulated cells with EPO or cibinetide caused a significant reduction of p65 DNA binding activity in 
a time-dependent manner (Fig. 6A), which translated into reduced activation of the Nos2 promoter, because 
NF-κ
B is a central activator of Nos2 transcription. Notably, the effects of EPO and cibinetide were diminished 
in cells transfected with Nos2 promoter constructs carrying site-specific mutations in the NF-κ
B consensus 
sequence (Fig. 6B). The inhibitory effects of EPO and cibinetide on p65 activation were not limited to the TLR4 
ligand LPS, but were also observed in BMDMs treated with PMA and ionomycin (data not shown) or in cells 
co-stimulated with LPS and TNF, IL-1ß, IFN-γ
 or IL-17A, respectively (Fig. 6C).
To determine whether the anti-inflammatory effects of EPO and cibinetide are dependent on 
JAK-STAT-dependent signaling or alternative pathways, we pre-incubated BMDMs with a panel of pharmaco-
logical inhibitors prior to the addition of EPO or cibinetide and stimulation with LPS, respectively. Inhibitors 
of STAT3 (WP1066) or STAT5 (M573108) did not interfere with EPO’s or cibinetide’s ability to de-activate p65 
(Fig. 6D). Neither did we see an effect using inhibitors of the MAP kinases MEK or p38 (Data not shown). In 
contrast, pre-treatment with the PI3 kinase inhibitor LY294002 blunted the effects of EPO or cibinetide on p65 
binding activity (Fig. 6E).
To corroborate these results, we generated BMDMs lacking JAK2 by Cre-lox technology (LysMCre-
(LMC)-Jak2−
/−). While stimulated LMC-Jak2+/+-BMDMs responded to EPO and cibinetide with 
JAK2-phosphorylation, no effect was found in LMC-Jak2-/-BMDMs (Fig. 6F). Notably, pre-treatment with EPO 
or cibinetide failed to suppress p65 binding activity in LMC-Jak2-/-BMDMs (Fig. 6G). In contrast, the glucocor-
ticoid dexamethasone (DEX) did inhibit p65 binding activity independent of the presence or absence of JAK2.
Cibinetide has little effect on cytokine production by T helper cells. 
As a range of T helper 
cell cytokines was significantly suppressed in the colon of DSS-exposed mice treated with EPO or cibinetide 
(Supplementary Table 1), we tested whether EPO or cibinetide may also act on isolated CD4+ T cells stimulated 
in vitro with PMA/ionomycin or with conditioned media (CM) of BMDMs treated with PMA/ionomycin and 
PBS (as solvent), EPO or cibinetide. We found a fairly small and non-significant inhibitory effect of EPO and 
cibinetide on IL-17A mRNA expression in isolated CD4+ cells stimulated with PMA/ionomycin (Supplementary 
Fig. S5C). In contrast, conditioned media of BMDMs treated with PMA/ionomycin and PBS (as solvent), EPO 
or cibinetide had differential effects on the mRNA expression of TNF, IFN-γ
, IL-17A, IL-4 and IL-6 dependent 
on whether or not conditioning of BMDMs included EPO or cibinetide (Supplementary Fig. S5A–S5E), further 
evidence that EPO and cibinetide act primarily on myeloid cells.
Discussion
The results of this study demonstrate that cibinetide exerts broad and potent anti-inflammatory effects on mye-
loid cells. In vitro, cibinetide significantly reduced the production of several macrophage-derived inflammatory 
mediators in response to LPS stimulation. In vivo, the proportion of TNF+ monocytes and macrophages in the 
colonic lamina propria was reduced after treatment of DSS-exposed mice with cibinetide or EPO. The observa-
tion that in vivo cibinetide treatment dampens the ex vivo secretion of Ccl2, Ccl3, Cxcl1 and Ccl11 by FAC-sorted 
monocytes and macrophages further suggests that the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the colonic lamina 
propria is dampened by activation of the IRR of myeloid cells. Since cibinetide has no effect on erythropoie-
sis, it appears unlikely that the compound may influence the ratio of erythropoiesis/myelopoiesis. In fact, the

proportion of Ter119+ vs. CD11b+ cells in the bone marrow was not affected by cibinetide. Moreover, IL-10 
and TGF-ß mRNA levels in the colon were dampened by cibinetide or EPO treatment in the same manner as 
were pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. We therefore propose a direct anti-inflammatory effect of 
cibinetide downstream of the IRR. The in vitro results obtained with JAK2 deficient BMDMs and with selective 
kinase inhibitors support this concept and further suggest that JAK2 and PI3K transduce this anti-inflammatory 
signal to the nucleus. Although EPO is known to influence several signal transduction cascades, we found that 
in LPS- or cytokine-stimulated macrophages, EPO and cibinetide primarily targeted the NF-κ
B subunit p65 
activation pathway following JAK2 phosphorylation. Since NF-κ
B is one of the crucial transcription factors in

the initiation and amplification of the inflammatory cascade, cibinetide and EPO both influence a key event of 
macrophage activation.
Inflammatory mediators such as TNF and IL-1ß auto-regulate their own expression via a positive amplifi-
cation loop involving NF-κ
B. Moreover, NF-κ
B coordinates the expression of a variety of other inflammatory 
genes, including adhesion molecules and additional transcription factors. NF-κ
B has further been shown to be 
centrally involved in the pathophysiology of human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and experimental colitis. 
The increased risk of Crohn’s disease observed in individuals with pathogenic nucleotide-binding oligomerization 
domain (NOD)−
2 polymorphisms is believed to result from increased NF-κ
B binding activity in the colon and 
enhanced secretion of IL-1ß29. Furthermore, lamina propria macrophages in IBD patients have increased NF-κ
B 
binding activity along with increased production of TNF, IL-1ß and IL-630,31. Experimental treatment strategies 
which specifically target p65 functions ameliorate disease severity in different models of murine colitis32–36.
Inhibition of NF-κ
B activation is thus a direct and promising intervention for the treatment of distinct forms 
of colitis. Cibinetide may have the capacity to beneficially interfere with the autocrine and paracrine stimu-
lation of cytokine production by macrophages and other immune cells within inflamed microenvironments.

Of relevance, medications used in the treatment of IBD such as glucocorticoids, sulfasalazine, mesalazine and 
leflunomide act, at least in part, via inhibition of NF-κ
B activity37. Consequently, the addition of cibinetide to 
established medications may help to accomplish dose reductions, thus limiting toxic side effects associated with 
current therapeutic regimens. Moreover, cibinetide may be especially valuable for patients who are primarily 
resistant to conventional therapies or experience tachyphylaxis38,39. An additional benefit is that cibinetide lacks 
side effects that are ascribed to the erythropoiesis inducing activity of EPO, such as hyperviscosity of the blood 
and an increased risk for thromboembolic events40.
In these studies we have demonstrated profound anti-inflammatory and disease modifying activity of cibinetide in 
the setting of DSS-induced colitis without evidence of unintended erythropoietic effects. The results of our studies are 
encouraging to initiate a randomized controlled trial to study the therapeutic potential of cibinetide in human IBD.
Materials and Methods

/− animals and Jak2+/+ littermates were used on a mixed C57BL/6N-Sv129 back-
ground42,43. CD131−
/− mice were generated and used as described44,45.
Establishment of DSS-Colitis. 
DSS-colitis was induced in male, pathogen-free, 8–12 weeks old C57BL/6N 
mice (Charles River Laboratories) following a reported protocol with slight modifications46. Briefly, 3% dextran 
sulfate sodium (DSS; MW 36,000–50,000; obtained from MP Biomedicals) was added to the drinking water with 
ad libitum availability to mice. Animals were treated with DSS or water for 7 consecutive days, followed by 7 days 
of water. Starting on day 8 after the initiation of DSS treatment, mice were daily administered 1.5 pmol/g body 
weight rhuEPO or cibinetide, while control mice received PBS. All animal experiments were performed according 
to the guidelines of the Medical University of Innsbruck based on the Austrian Animal Testing Act of 1988. All 
animal experiment protocols were approved by the ‘MUI Animal ethics committee’ and the Austrian Ministry for 
Science and Education (approval no. BMWF-66.011/0020-II/3b/2012).
Cell Isolation and Culture. 
Age and sex matched mice were sacrificed, bone marrow cells were recovered 
from tibiae and femora and erythrocytes were lysed. BMDMs were initially cultured on non-tissue culture dishes 
using 100 ng/ml recombinant murine (rmu) M-CSF (Prepotech). BMDMs used in assays were between 6 d and 8 
d in culture and were grown overnight on tissue culture 6-well plates prior use.
CD4+ T cells were isolated from spleen by positive selection using a specific MACS system (Miltenyi Biotec) 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cells were incubated with 2 pmol/mL rhuEPO or cibinetide diluted in PBS or PBS alone. After another 30 
min, cells were stimulated with 200 ng/mL LPS (lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli 055:B5), 100 ng/ml 
PMA (phorbol-12-myristate-13acetate), 500 ng/ml ionomycin (Sigma) and/or 10 ng/mL rmu TNF, IL-1ß, IFN-γ
 
or IL-17A (R&D) while controls were treated with PBS. Thereafter, supernatants were harvested and cells were 
subjected to RNA or protein preparation. The use of either rhuEPO theta (Eporatio®; Ratiopharm) or of rmuEPO 
(R&D) yielded very similar results. Thus, rhuEPO was used for subsequent experiments. Where indicated, 100 µM 
AG490 (JAK2 inhibitor), 10 µM WP1066 (STAT3 inhibitor), 200 µM M573108 (STAT5 inhibitor), 50 µM PD98059 
(MEK inhibitor), 500 µM SB203540 (p38 MAPK inhibitor; all obtained from Merck), 50 µg/ml CAPE (NF-κ
B 
inhibitor; from Marlingen), 50 µM LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor; Merck) or 50 µg/ml dexamethasone (Sigma) were 
used. PBS, DMSO (Sigma) or SB202474 (negative control for SB203540; Merck) served as appropriate controls.
Colonic lamina propria cells were isolated from the large intestine as described previously47,48. In brief, the 
colon was opened longitudinally, cut into small pieces and washed extensively in PBS to remove feces and debris. 
Following incubation in HBSS containing 5% FCS, 1.5 mg/ml collagenase VIII and 40 µg/ml DNase I (Sigma), sus-
pensions of lamina propria cells were directly stained for flow cytometry or cell sorting. Individual cell populations 
 
were sorted as detailed in the Supplementary information section. Purity of isolated cell populations was at least 
98% as determined by FACS analysis.
For human mononuclear cell cultures, 1–3 ×
 105/ml mononuclear cells (MNC) isolated by lymphoprep from 
peripheral blood of healthy donors were dissolved in IMDM/5% FCS, counted and mixed with methylcellulose 
(MethocultTM GF+ H4535 without EPO, StemCell Technologies, Germany) and either solvent or increasing con-
centrations of EPO (0.4 or 1.2 pmol/mL rhuEPO) or CIB (0.4, 1.2 or 12 pmol/mL cibinetide). Cells were cultured 
for 14 days and BFU-E were identified according to their morphology with an inverted microscope and a 100 mm 
culture dish marked with the scoring grid. For analysis of hemoglobin content and mRNA expression, colonies 
were picked according to their morphology, pooled in PBS and frozen for later analyses. All methods were carried 
out in accordance with the guidelines and regulations of the Medical University Innsbruck. All experimental 
protocols were approved by the bioethical committee ‘Ethikkommission’ of the Medical University Innsbruck. 
Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects.
Flow Cytometry. 
Cell suspensions were stained in PBS supplemented with sterile 1% FBS and 0.5% BSA 
using the antibodies listed in the Supplementary information section.
RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR. 
Preparation of total RNA and quantification of 
mRNA expression by quantitative Taqman RT-PCR following reverse transcription was performed exactly as 
described16. For colon samples, the Dynabeads® mRNA kit was used (Ambion).
Protein extraction and Western blot analysis. 
Protein extraction and Western blotting were performed 
exactly as described49. NF-κ
B p65 binding activity in nuclear extracts was assessed using a chemi-luminescent 
assay kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Pierce).
Transient Transfections. 
The full-length Nos2 promoter (WT-Nos2-luc), cloned into the pGL2 basic 
luciferase reporter gene vector, as well as Nos2-luciferase reporter constructs bearing point mutations at 
the NF-κ
B consensus sequences of either the proximal region I (mut-κ
BI-Nos2-luc), the distal region II 
(mut-κ
BII-Nos2-luc), or at both sites (mut-κ
BI/II-Nos-luc) were used50,51. Nos2 promoter activity was deter-
mined by the Dual Luciferase system (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Detection of cytokines, reactive species and hemoglobin. 
Determination of cytokines in culture 
supernatants was performed with specific ELISA kits (from R&D). Hemoglobin content was measured in a spec-
trophotometer at a wave length of 660 nm based on the heme-catalyzed oxidation of tetramethylbenzidine by 
H2O2 using serial dilutions of purified human hemoglobin (Sigma) as standard52. Values were normalized for 
total protein of bone marrow cells as determined by BCA (Pierce) or for dry weight of fecal content.

Histopathology. 
Histological examinations of tissues from in vivo infection and colitis experiments, respec-
tively, were performed on formalin-fixed tissue sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) according to a 
standard protocol. The degree of colonic inflammation on microscopic sections was graded semi-quantitatively 
as described28. Histological scoring was performed by an experienced pathologist blinded to study design and 
sample identity.
Statistical analysis. 
Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS using unpaired two-tailed student’s 
t-tests or by Mann-Whitney U test to assess data where only two groups existed. Analysis of variance combined 
with Bonferroni correction or Kruskall-Wallis test, as appropriate, was used for all other experiments. Survival 
was compared by log-rank test. P values less than 0.05 were considered significant.
