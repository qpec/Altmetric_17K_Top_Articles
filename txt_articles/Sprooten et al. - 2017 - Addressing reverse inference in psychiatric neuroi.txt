Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in psychiatry use various tasks to iden-
tify case-control differences in the patterns of task-related brain activation. Differently activated regions
are often ascribed disorder-specific functions in an attempt to link disease expression and brain function.
We undertook a systematic meta-analysis of data from task-fMRI studies to examine the effect of diagno-
sis and study design on the spatial distribution and direction of case-control differences on brain activa-
tion. We mapped to atlas regions coordinates of case-control differences derived from 537 task-fMRI
studies in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and obsessive
compulsive disorder comprising observations derived from 21,427 participants. The fMRI tasks were
classified according to the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC). We investigated whether diagnosis, RDoC
domain or construct and use of regions-of-interest or whole-brain analyses influenced the neuroanatomi-
cal pattern of results. When considering all primary studies, we found an effect of diagnosis for the
amygdala and caudate nucleus and an effect of RDoC domains and constructs for the amygdala, hippocam-
pus, putamen and nucleus accumbens. In contrast, whole-brain studies did not identify any significant
effect of diagnosis or RDoC domain or construct. These results resonate with prior reports of common brain
structural and genetic underpinnings across these disorders and caution against attributing undue specific-
ity to brain functional changes when forming explanatory models of psychiatric disorders. Hum Brain Mapp

INTRODUCTION
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is widely
used in psychiatric neuroimaging because of its excellent
safety profile, high patient acceptability, good spatial reso-
lution and acceptable temporal resolution. To date, the
majority of fMRI studies have examined the spatial distri-
bution and level of blood oxygenation-level dependent

 (BOLD) signal associated with performance of different
tasks. The ultimate aim of this line of research is the iden-
tification of abnormalities in task-related neural activity
that are associated with a specific psychiatric disorder or
symptom dimension. Much of the recent scientific impetus
for task-fMRI studies in psychiatry can be attributed to the
Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project [Cuthbert, 2014;
Insel et al., 2010; Sanislow et al., 2010]. The RDoC project
posits that psychiatric diagnoses result from disruption in
brain circuits that underpin domains of mental function
which are important for adaptive behavior. These com-
prise circuits associated with reward (positive valence sys-
tems),
threat
sensitivity
(negative
valence
systems),
cognitive processes, interpersonal interactions (social pro-
cesses), and biological activation (arousal and regulation)
[Sanislow et al., 2010]. In this scheme, task-fMRI is an
important tool in mapping mental processes to neural cir-
cuits. Case-control differences in task-related brain activity
are then used to make inferences about abnormalities in
domain circuits relating to disease processes.
The literature on task-fMRI in psychiatric disorders is
extensive and lends itself to quantitative synthesis of the
findings from the primary studies. Neuroimaging studies
typically report the locations of peak statistical effects
using anatomical coordinates referenced to a stereotactic
system, most commonly the Talairach [Talairach and
Tournoux, 1988] or the Montreal Neurological Institute
(MNI) coordinate space [Evans et al., 1993]. Because of
this reporting convention, quantitative synthesis of task-
fMRI data utilizes coordinate-based analyses that are con-
cerned with the consistency and specificity of the spatial
convergence of the results of the primary studies [Fox
et al., 1998; Wager et al., 2007]. To date, the task-fMRI lit-
erature has been synthesized in multiple coordinate-
based meta-analyses that have mainly focused on a single
psychiatric disorder [e.g., Chen et al. 2011; Crossley et al.,
2016; Del Casale et al., 2015; Gentili et al., 2016; Graham
et al., 2013; Ipser et al., 2013; Miller et al., 2015; Minzen-
berg et al., 2009]. The few meta-analyses that have com-
pared two or more disorders suggest commonalities in
the patterns of fMRI activation that transcend current
nosological categorizations [e.g., Delvecchio et al., 2013;
Etkin and Wager, 2007]. Evidence of trans-diagnostic
overlap has also been reported in brain structural [e.g.,
Arnone et al., 2009; Goodkind et al., 2015; Kempton et al.,
2011] and in genetic studies [e.g., Cross-Disorder Group
of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2013; Network
and Pathway Analysis Subgroup of Psychiatric Genomics
Consortium, 2015]. This has led to proposals that psychi-
atric disorders may arise from perturbations in the func-
tional and structural organization of common large-scale
brain networks [Menon, 2011]. It is, therefore, timely to
interrogate the task-fMRI literature to characterize the
spatial pattern of case-control differences in brain activa-
tion
across
multiple
RDoC
domains
and
psychiatric
diagnoses.
Given the size and complexity of the relevant literature,
we chose to focus on task-fMRI data comparing healthy
adults to adult patients diagnosed with schizophrenia
(SCZ), major depressive disorder (MDD), Bipolar Disorder
(BD), anxiety disorders (ANX), and Obsessive Compulsive
Disorder (OCD). These psychiatric conditions are particu-
larly amenable to joint examination because they are often
comorbid at syndromal level and show significant overlap
at the level of symptom dimensions [Buckley et al., 2009;
DeVylder et al., 2014; Gorun et al., 2015; Kessler et al.,
1994; Markon 2010; Vaidyanathan et al., 2012]. We there-
fore conducted a quantitative analysis of neuroimaging
studies of these disorders and mapped peak coordinates
of case-control differences in regional brain activation to
predefined cortical and subcortical regions within a canon-
ical atlas space. We classified each task according to its
corresponding RDoC domain and construct. The coordi-
nates of each case-control difference were then coded
according to the corresponding RDoC domain and con-
trast, the diagnosis of the patient group in the primary
study, the level of inference (region of interest or whole-
brain) and the direction of signal change (hypoactivation
or hyperactivation in patients compared to healthy partici-
pants). The main aims of the analysis were to test for diag-
nostic specificity of the reported case-control differences
and to investigate whether any diagnostic specificity (if
present) could be attributed to dysfunction within RDoC-
specified circuits. The issue of specificity is of primary con-
cern particularly in task-fMRI studies where there is often
a tendency “to reason backward from patterns of activa-
tion to infer the engagement of specific mental processes”
[Poldrack, 2006, 2011] and by extension to infer abnormali-
ties of specific mental processes in relation to different
disorders [Paulus, 2015]. Addressing the issue of specific-
ity in connection to task-fMRI is a fundamental first step
in moving the field forward conceptually and in identify-
ing new directions for methodological refinement and
improvement.
METHODS
Literature Search and Study Selection
We included original, peer-reviewed fMRI studies that
compared healthy adults (age range 18–65 years) to adult
patients with SCZ, BD, MDD, OCD, or Anxiety Disorders
(Generalized
Anxiety
Disorders,
Panic
Disorder,
Post-
Traumatic Stress Disorder, Specific Phobias and Social
Anxiety Disorder) and reported case-control differences in
stereotactic space. Among anxiety disorders, we examined
only those for which we could identify a minimum of sev-
en primary studies. This was not a consideration for the
other diagnostic categories where the literature was more
extensive. We excluded case reports, case series, reviews,
studies that combined patients with different diagnoses
into a single group and duplicate citations. We interrogated

 databases available through the National Center for Bio-
technology Information up to December 2013 using relevant
expanded subject headings and free text searches. A total of
12,037 unique publications were examined and 537 were
included in the analyses based on the Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses Statement
(PRISMA;
http://www.prisma-statement.org/).

diagrams and full citations of the studies included are avail-
able in Supporting Information Methods 1 and 2a-e. Sup-
porting Information Figure S1 shows the number of studies
and their mean sample size per year of publication.
Database Construction
The following were recorded from each study separately
for patient and control groups: number of participants, age
[mean and standard deviation (SD)], sex (% male), diag-
nostic classification system (e.g., DSM-IV), and diagnostic
ascertainment (i.e., structured interview or clinical assess-
ment). The following were recorded, when available, from
each study for each patient group: current and lifetime
comorbidity with alcohol or substance abuse/dependence,
medication status (% receiving any psychotropic medica-
tion), and medication type (% atypical antipsychotics, %
typical antipsychotics, % antidepressants, % anticonvul-
sants and % lithium). For each study, we recorded the
year of publication, the field strength of the MRI scanner,
the activation paradigm used during fMRI data acquisi-
tion, the direction of activation changes in patients com-
pared to healthy individuals for each contrast and the
level of inference (region of interest, small-volume correc-
tion, and whole-brain). For brevity, the term ROI will be
used hereafter to denote both region-of-interest and small-
volume correction analyses. We followed the RDoC project
in classifying fMRI paradigms according to RDoC domains
and constructs. The number of studies included per diag-
nosis, level of inference and RDoC domain and demo-
graphic details of the samples are shown in Tables I and
II. Details of the study samples, tasks and task-contrasts
used can be found in Supporting Information Methods 3.
Quantification of Studies Per Anatomical Region
We extracted the coordinates of the anatomical locations
of the peak statistical effects for case-control differences
from each primary study. Following the general conven-
tion in meta-analyses, we accepted the results reported as
significant in the primary studies. A small minority of pri-
mary studies used two fMRI tasks in which case we used
the coordinates of the case-control differences for each
task.
When
both
ROI
and
whole-brain
results
were
reported in the same study we only used the coordinates
from the whole-brain analyses. Coordinates were trans-
formed to MNI, if reported in Talairach space, using the
“tal2icbm_fsl”
transform
(http://www.brainmap.org/
icbm2tal/). All coordinates were mapped to the Harvard-

 Oxford cortical and subcortical atlases [Desikan et al.,
2006; Frazier et al., 2005] (http://www.cma.mgh.harvard.
edu/fsl_atlas.html; http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/), with a
probability threshold of 10% for each region. This thresh-
old accommodates uncertainty about region localization
across individuals and studies and recognizes that activa-
tion clusters extend beyond the location of the peak coordi-
nates. The number of unique primary studies reporting one
or more coordinates within each region was calculated.
Studies that reported two or more coordinates within the
same anatomical region were only counted once. Study-
counts were summed across hemispheres for each region.
Statistical Analyses
Independent variables of interest were diagnosis, level
of inference (ROI or whole-brain), RDoC domain, RDoC
construct, and direction of signal change (hypoactivation
or hyperactivation in patients compared to healthy partici-
pants). The dependent variable was number of unique
studies implicating each Harvard-Oxford cortical and sub-
cortical atlas region. To test the effect of diagnosis, we cre-
ated diagnosis-by-region cross-tables and performed v2
tests with Yates’ correction. The same approach was then
used to investigate the effect of each of the other variables
of interest. Then, we investigated the effect of the variables
of interest separately for each atlas region using Fisher-
exact tests. We tested for the similarity of the anatomical
distributions of results for each variable of interest using
Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients of the numbers of
studies contributing to each atlas region. For example, to
test whether studies of SCZ report similar results to BD,
we calculated the correlation between the number of SCZ
studies by atlas region to those of BD.
We performed Kruskal-Wallis tests to compare the values
of each continuous, quantitative demographic and clinical
variable (sample size, age [mean and SD], % male, % of
patients on medication and % on each medication type)
between studies that reported an effect in each region
and studies that did not. For discrete, categorical variables
(substance abuse exclusion, scanner field strength) we
performed chi-square tests per region.
To meaningfully compare the distribution of studies
across anatomical regions and diagnoses, study counts are
represented as a percentage of the total number of studies
for each diagnosis divided by the volume of the anatomi-
cal region, as larger brain regions would be statistically
more likely to contain activation loci simply by virtue of
their size. This yielded a score for each diagnosis, for each
atlas region, quantified as the percentage of studies for the
respective diagnosis, per cm3 within the respective region.
To test whether this score was randomly (i.e., normally)
distributed across regions, we performed Kolmogorov
Smirnov tests of the score distribution across all regions
and
across
cortical
regions
and
subcortical
regions
separately.
RESULTS
Anatomical Distribution of Results Depending on
Inference Level
When all reported coordinates were considered together
(regardless of whether the primary studies used a whole-
brain or ROI approach), case-control differences in BOLD
signal were reported in all atlas regions between 4 and 239
times as shown in Supporting Information Figure S2 and
S3.Coordinates reported by ROI versus whole-brain stud-
ies were not equally distributed across all atlas regions
(v2 5 99.59, P < 1023). The same was observed when sub-
cortical
(v2 5 25.13,
P < 1023)
and
cortical
regions
(v2 5 64.07, P 50.04) were considered separately. When
considering case-control differences from studies using
whole-brain analyses only, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
examining the distribution of number of studies per cm3
was no longer significant (D 5 0.10, P 5 0.58), indicating
that subcortical regions were not significantly overrepre-
sented among whole-brain studies alone. Following Fisher-
exact tests comparing each region to the total numbers of
ROI and whole-brain studies, 3 out of the 8 sub-cortical
regions and 16 out of the 48 cortical areas showed at least
a nominal effect of level of inference (Table III). Whole-
brain studies were significantly overrepresented among
those studies contributing to the thalamus and the brain
stem, whereas ROI studies have been chiefly responsible

 for results in the amygdala (Table III). Regarding cortical
regions, ROI studies tended to focus on frontal and tempo-
ral regions and less on parietal and occipital regions (Table
III). Nevertheless, the frequency of ROI and whole-brain
results correlated highly across regions (q 5 0.78, P < 10211,
adjusted for region volume). Regions that were significant-
ly supported by ROI studies tended to be among the top
regions showing case-control differences even when con-
sidering whole-brain studies alone. This lends indirect
support to the a priori ROI selection. However, the poste-
rior parahippocampal gyrus and the thalamus appear to
be remarkably under-selected among studies using ROI
analyses despite the high frequency of case-control differ-
ences in these regions at the whole-brain level (Table III).

Anatomical Distribution of Results Depending on
Diagnosis
Overall, there was no significant effect of diagnosis on
the spatial distribution of the reported case-control differ-
ences (v2 5 232, P 5 0.27). Pairwise contrasts of study-
counts across all regions yielded nominal results for the
contrasts of SCZ and MDD (P 5 0.01) and of SCZ and anx-
iety disorders (P 5 0.05). The general lack of diagnostic
specificity is also apparent in the Spearman’s rank correla-
tions (Table IV and Supporting Information Tables 2 and
3), as for each pair of diagnoses, correlation coefficients
across regions ranged between 0.42 and 0.82 and were
highly significant (0.001 < P < 10212). When cortical and
subcortical regions were examined separately, a significant
effect
of
diagnosis
on
the
anatomical
distribution
of
reported locations of case-control differences was found
for
subcortical
(v2 5 52.75,
P 5 0.003),
but
not
cortical
regions. This effect was driven by the amygdala (P 5 0.01)
and the caudate nucleus (P < 0.01; Table III), but disap-
peared when considering only whole-brain studies (Table
V). In contrast, among whole-brain studies the only region
that showed a nominally significant effect of diagnosis
was the nucleus accumbens (P 5 0.004). This effect was
primarily driven by an increased frequency of results
reported in the nucleus accumbens from OCD studies
compared to SCZ (P 5 0.017) and MDD (P 5 0.004) studies.
Considering each region separately, none of the 56 regions
showed an effect of diagnosis that was significant under a
Bonferroni-corrected a of 0.05/56 5 0.0009 (Tables III and
V). The inference-dependence of the diagnostic effects is
also illustrated in Figures 2–8.
To examine the robustness of these results, we calculat-
ed the observed effect size for the overall chi-square test
of diagnosis. We show that the chi-square test for the
effect of diagnosis had 97% power to detect a modest
effect size of w 5 0.2 (df 5 220, alpha 5 0.05, 2,267 observa-
tions, calculated using G*Power), and >99.99% power to
detect a moderate effect size of w 5 0.30, even when con-
sidering only whole-brain studies. Next, we calculated the
number
of
additional
studies
required
to
potentially
change the current findings by simulating multiples of our
cross-tables in R. The effect size of diagnosis was Cramer’s
V 5 0.11 when considering both region of interest and
whole brain studies. Therefore 500 new studies would be
required to detect a diagnostic difference at 80% power
and alpha < 0.05. When considering only whole brain
studies, 1,054 additional studies would be required to
detect a significant effect of diagnosis, at 80% power and
alpha <0.05. We conducted the same analyses at the level
of brain regions. For a significant effect of diagnosis, given
the observed effect sizes the number of studies required
increased further. For example, for the amygdala and mid-
dle frontal gyrus, two regions that are commonly included
in different disease models, we would require approxi-
mately double the size of the current database. A review
of the literature as the meta-analysis was conducted
showed that 47 potentially eligible studies were published
for SCZ and the numbers for the other conditions were
substantially smaller. Therefore, inclusion of these studies
would be unlikely to change the results.
Anatomical Distribution of Results Across RDoC
Domains and Constructs
When all primary studies were considered together
(irrespective of diagnosis), the choice of task, as classified
by RDoC domains and constructs, had an effect on the
location of case-control differences in subcortical structures
(domains: v2 5 66.71, P 5 1.17 3 1026; constructs: v2 5
130.79, P 5 1.46 3 1025; Fig. 9). Following Fisher exact tests
per region, effects were significant for the amygdala, hip-
pocampus, putamen, and nucleus accumbens (Table III; all
Puncorrected � 0.01). In the cortex, the overall effect was not
significant (domains: v2 5 156.4 P 5 0.10; constructs: v2 5
397.61, P 5 0.78); only a nominally significant effect could
be detected in the frontal medial cortex, frontal operculum
and the anterior parahippocampal gyrus (Table III; all
Puncorrected � 0.01). However, after excluding ROI studies,
no
regions
were
significantly
associated
with
RDoC
domains, or constructs (Table V; all Puncorrected > 0.08). The
frequency of the RDoC domains tested in the primary
studies
was
significantly
different
across
diagnoses
(v2 5 87.24; P < 10212, Table I). Therefore, we tested wheth-
er classifying studies by RDoC domain may uncover
diagnosis-specific patterns of results. Fisher-exact tests per

any significant results beyond what could be expected by
chance (all P > 0.01).
Anatomical Distribution of Results Depending on
Direction of Signal Change
Across all studies, the pattern of “hyperactive” and
“hypoactive” foci in patients compared to controls was
highly correlated across all regions (q 5 0.79, P < 2.2 3
10216). Nevertheless, this effect was not distributed equally
across all regions (v2 5 98.51, P 5 0.0001), cortical regions
(v2 5 65.93,
P 5 0.03),
or
subcortical
regions
(v2 5 29.90,
P < 1024). The amygdala, planum polare, and the anterior
part of the inferior temporal gyrus were significantly more
likely to be “hyperactive” in patients, whereas the putamen
and nucleus accumbens more likely to be “hypoactive”
(Table IV, Supporting Information Figure S4a and S4b).
Effect of Potential Moderating Demographic and
Clinical Variables
The following P-values are Bonferroni-corrected for num-
ber of regions tested, but not for number of moderator vari-
ables

to
allow
potentially
meaningful
moderator effects to be considered in future study designs.
We found no evidence for an effect of medication status
(medicated vs. unmedicated patients; all P > 0.14), medica-
tion type (all P> 0.99), study sample size (all P> 0.5), year
of publication (P > 0.17), and mean age and SD (all P > 0.64)
for any region. A significant effect of alcohol and substance
abuse was found only for the angular gyrus (v25 16.96;
P 5 0.01). Of the studies that included patients regardless of
substance abuse status, 50% reported case-control differ-
ences in this region compared to 23% of studies that
excluded patients with a lifetime history of substance abuse,
and compared to 14% of studies that excluded patients with
both current and lifetime substance abuse. Studies that
reported results in the frontal pole tended to include more
female
patients
(W5 39,607;
P5 0.04)
and
controls
(W5 39,351; P5 0.06). Studies reporting results in the frontal
medial cortex also included on average a higher proportion
of female patients (W5 15,862, P 5 0.03), but not controls.
Finally, higher field-strengths were more likely to contribute
to results in the frontal pole (v2 5 21.84; P 5 0.001).
DISCUSSION
This study was motivated by the need to interrogate the
large
task-fMRI
literature
for
evidence
of
specificity
between regional activation patterns and diagnosis for
common psychiatric disorders. A further aim was to test
whether any evidence of specificity could be accounted for
by abnormalities in task-related activations pertaining to
mental function domains specified in the RDoC project.
We also investigated which regions are most influenced,
and possibly biased, by level of inference by comparing
the results of ROI studies to data-driven whole-brain stud-
ies. Study results are based on the quantitative synthesis
of task-fMRI findings from 547 studies comprising obser-
vations derived from 21,692 participants.
Similarity in the Spatial Distribution of Task-fMRI

ric Disorders
We found nominal effects of diagnosis in several regions
when
considering
both
ROI
and
whole-brain
studies
(Table III); these results were driven by ROI studies alone

r Sprooten et al. r
r 1854 r
 and none survived Bonferroni-corrected P-values. Thus,
great caution is required in attributing these subtle and
potentially
biased results
as indicative of
meaningful
diagnosis-specific effects. Rather, our results indicate that
the anatomical distribution of case-control fMRI studies
are largely diagnostic-general, as indicated by the high
similarities between case-control fMRI results across disor-
ders (Figs. 2 and 428, Table IV, Supporting Information
Tables S2 and S3). The similarity in the cortical regions
implicated in MDD and anxiety disorders is particularly
striking as shown in Figures 5 and 7.
It is theoretically possible that misdiagnosis, medication,
symptom profile or disease severity may have influenced
the analyses of case-control differences. Given the differ-
ences in these variables between diagnostic groups, we
consider a systematic bias resulting in increased similarity
between diagnoses to be implausible. For example, on
average 92% of patients with SCZ were prescribed anti-
psychotics while this was the case for only 15% of patients
with OCD. Therefore we consider alternate interpretation
for the similarities in the spatial distribution of task-fMRI
case-control differences. It is possible that the disorders
examined here arise from largely overlapping neural net-
work dysfunction. This observation is supported by a
recent meta-analysis of brain structural case-control differ-
ences across multiple disorders that also failed to identify

 diagnosis-specific effects [Goodkind et al., 2015]. A com-
mon biological substrate provides an explanation for the
symptomatic
overlap in the
disorders examined here
[Beesdo et al., 2010; Buckley et al., 2009; Eisen and Ras-
mussen, 1993; Kim et al., 2015; OConghaile and DeLisi,
2015; Pearlson, 2015; Rosen et al., 2012]. The transdiagnos-
tic overlap in brain activation abnormalities also resonates
with behavioral observations of shared transdiagnostic
cognitive deficits that are present at or before disease onset
[Shanmugan et al., 2016; Koenen et al., 2009], and with
transdiagnostic overlap of genetic risk factors [Cross-disor-
der group of the PGC, 2013; Doherty and Owen, 2014].
Thus,
it
appears
that
transdiagnostic
overlap
is
consistently observed at multiple scales of enquiry involv-
ing genetic factors, symptoms, cognitive function, brain
morphology, and brain activity. This encourages a cross-
diagnostic approach to the investigation of the biological
underpinnings of mental disorders. However, there are
significant differences in the relative prevalence of symp-
toms across the disorders examined here. For example,
OCD symptoms may be present in about 18% of patients
with SCZ [Kim et al., 2015] and psychotic experiences are
reported by about 14% of patients with OCD [Eisen and
Rasmussen, 1993]. Our findings suggest that the relation-
ship between abnormalities in task-related networks to
symptoms is both complex and unclear. This relationship
Figure 4.

r Sprooten et al. r
r 1856 r
 has mostly been examined in SCZ where cognitive dys-
function shows no correlation with positive symptoms and
only a moderate correlation with negative symptoms [Ven-
tura et al., 2009, 2010]. It is therefore likely that the abnor-
malities in brain networks and network-regions we can
observe with fMRI reflect disorder-general conditions that
facilitate the emergence and persistence of symptoms but
are
insufficient
for
explaining
symptomatic
variability
across disorders. Task-related fMRI cannot identify the
nature of computations at the neuronal level; it can only
detect the corresponding BOLD signal that suggest that
such
computations
within
neuronal
assemblies.
It
is
possible that the variability in the observed and reported
symptoms across disorders is linked to the exact nature of
neuronal computations which may not be detectable by the
task-related fMRI studies included in this meta-analysis.
Regions Implicated Across Disorders
Although case-control differences were widely distribut-
ed, the dorsal and ventral striatum, the amygdala and
hippocampus and cortical regions within the frontal oper-
culum/anterior insula, posterior parahippocampal gyrus
and paracingulate gyrus were relatively overrepresented
Figure 5.
Percentage of studies of major depression reporting one or more coordinates within each cortical

r Reverse Inference in Psychiatric Neuroimaging r
r 1857 r
 (Fig. 1). Meta-analyses of anatomical MRI studies have
confirmed the involvement of subcortical pathology in
SCZ [van Erp et al., 2016], MDD [Schmaal et al., 2016] and
BD [Hibar et al., 2016] while a meta-analysis of brain volu-
metric studies identified cortical grey matter reductions in
the insula and the anterior cingulate cortex as the most
robust deficits across disorders [Goodkind, 2015].
We found some evidence for diagnostic specificity, sup-
ported by whole-brain studies, regarding the nucleus
accumbens: case-control differences in this region were
more frequently reported in OCD, particularly compared
to MDD and SCZ. This observation does not imply that
the nucleus accumbens is not involved in disorders other
than OCD. Rather, it indicates the relative importance of
the nucleus accumbens in OCD compared to other disor-
ders, which is congruent with current neurocognitive theo-
ries of OCD that focus on cortico-striatal-thalamic loops
[Graybiel and Rauch, 2000; Milad and Rauch, 2012]. The
role of the nucleus accumbens in this framework lies in
the integration of affective information with motor selec-
tion [Fineberg et al., 2010; Wood and Ahmari, 2015]. How-
ever, given the difficulty of imaging a small structure like
the nucleus accumbens with high confidence, studies that
specifically focus on nucleus accumbens anatomy and

 function are necessary to verify and understand the pre-
sent finding.
Similarity in the Spatial Distribution of Task-fMRI
Foci of Case-Control Differences Across RDoC
Domains and Constructs
The results of our study suggest that tasks assigned to
different RDoC domains or constructs result in a similar
neuroanatomical distribution of case-control differences.
The RDoC framework specifies different mental processes
that are grouped together under distinct domains which are
assumed to map on discrete neural circuits. However, the
degree to which mental processes engage specific, common
or partially overlapping regions remains a topic of debate
[Pessoa, 2014; Price and Friston, 2005]. In fMRI experiments,
multiple brain areas are co-activated during a given task;
conversely a single brain area may be activated by dispa-
rate tasks that may not always share cognitive components
[Price and Friston, 2005]. The relationship between brain
structure and function has been described both as pluripo-
tent (one-to-many) and degenerate (many-to-one). Price and
Friston
[2005]
argue
that
although

 engaged
by
multiple
dissimilar
processes,
there
is
a
“common denominator” that encapsulates the core func-
tionality of each region. Conversely, given the pluripotent
nature of brain organization, such common denominator
labels can be attributed to multiple brain regions that are
bound to overlap significantly with brain regions defined
by other “common denominator” labels. Our data suggest
that RDoC domains and constructs operate at the level of
“common denominator” labels which could account for the
similarity in the spatial pattern of case-control differences
across the diagnoses examined. Alternatively, our results
may reflect the fact that standard univariate MRI analyses
may not be ideally suited for the examination of brain
structure-function relationships relevant to disease process-
es as they do not provide information about the interactions
between the brain regions engaged during a task. It has
been argued that brain connectivity, rather than activation,
patterns may lead to increased specificity in localizing cog-
nitive
processing
and

[Menon, 2011; Muldoon and Bassett, 2014]. To date howev-
er, examination of connectomic architecture of the brain has
contributed further to the idea that disease expression
impacts shared brain regions and networks across psychiat-
ric disorders [Crossley et al., 2014].

 The foci identified in task fMRI studies reflect the con-
trast between baseline and task-related brain activity. Indi-
vidual differences in baseline activation patterns, such as
inherent low frequency fluctuations, occur independently
from task and may depend on intrinsic connectivity and
morphology, synaptic organization and neuronal density,
and physiological parameters such as heart rate and
vascular factors. These inherent activation patterns are
detectable during rest fMRI, and predict those that can be
observed during tasks [Zou et al., 2013]. However, this is a
line of enquiry for future studies as task-fMRI meta-analy-
ses of published data cannot address the contribution of
baseline activity.
ROI Analysis and Confirmation Bias
The use of ROI has the advantage of restricting analyses
to specific brain regions thus reducing the burden of correc-
tion for multiple testing. We found a correlation between
case-control frequencies derived from ROI analyses and
those derived from whole-brain analyses, which generally
supports this practice. However, on a region-by-region basis
we also found that ROI studies resulted in the over-
representation of the amygdala and the caudate nucleus,
which was not supported when whole-brain studies were
considered. Conversely, several regions, particularly the
thalamus and parahippocampal gyrus, are not commonly
selected in analyses based on a priori hypotheses despite
data-driven support from whole-brain studies for their
involvement in psychiatric disorders. The pre-selection of
ROIs, possibly in combination with the difficulty of pub-
lishing negative results, seems to bias the literature and
may
indirectly
lead
to
oversimplification
and
over-
localization of neurobiological models of behavior and
symptoms. Our data cautions that overreliance on ROI
analysis may hamper data-driven discovery and artificial-
ly exaggerate the role of some regions in psychiatric dis-
orders while ignoring crucial contributions from others.
Limitations
As this is a co-ordinate based meta-analyses, we did not
include studies that did not find case-control differences.
Although it is statistically possible to model negative
Figure 9.
For each region, the contribution of studies that used tasks engaging domains defined by the RDoC
project is shown as a proportion of the total number of studies showing case-control differences in
that region. Regional distributions can be compared to the overall RDoC distribution shown in the
bars on the right of each figure. [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]

 studies, such practice would rely on the assumption that
negative studies were indeed sufficiently powered. Given
the wide variability of tasks, sample characteristics and
analyses methods, meaningful retrospective assessment of
power at the level of individual studies is infeasible. More-
over, our aim was to test whether it is possible to infer
diagnostic specificity for any brain region implicated by
available task-fMRI data.
We do not examine the effect of symptom severity as
there was little overlap in scales within diagnosis and par-
ticularly across diagnoses. We consider that symptom
severity is unlikely to have changed our results given the
lack of a significant effect of diagnosis in the topology of
case-control differences despite the variable clinical pre-
sentation of the patient samples. The studies we consid-
ered varied widely in the details of their task designs and
within-subject condition contrasts. We were guided by the
RDoC project in assigning the different tasks to their pur-
ported cognitive domains as we were interested in identi-
fying associations between RDoC domains and diagnosis
on case-control differences in patterns of task-fMRI activa-
tion. It is theoretically possible, although unlikely given
the general lack of diagnosis-specific findings, that other
approaches to task classification may have yielded differ-
ent results. However, we consider the RDoC scheme to
represent the best approximation to a gold standard classi-
fication for fMRI tasks.
We used a standard atlas to map the reported coordi-
nates as this facilitates interpretation of the results. As foci
could only be mapped to regions included in the atlas, we
ensured that our chosen atlas included all main subcortical
regions, such as the nucleus accumbens, which proved to
be important. As larger brain regions are by default more
likely to include more coordinates, we accounted for this
by normalizing the number of studies by region volume,
by covarying for region volume, or by comparing the fre-
quency distributions against predicted frequency distribu-
tions under the null hypothesis given the same regions.
CONCLUSION
The findings of this study suggests that case-control dif-
ferences in task-fMRI activation reveal a shared topogra-
phy for SCZ, BD, MDD, anxiety disorders, and OCD. This
shared topography explains common deficits in cognitive
circuits but does not fully account for variability in clinical
presentation and cannot be assumed to imply shared etio-
logical or pathogenic mechanisms. Our findings encourage
studies that cross diagnostic boundaries, emphasize the
importance of whole-brain studies and urge the careful
interpretation and consideration of ROI studies.
