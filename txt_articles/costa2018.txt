IMPORTANCE Open fractures of the lower limb occur when a broken bone penetrates the
skin. There can be major complications from these fractures, which can be life-changing.
OBJECTIVES To assess the disability, rate of deep infection, and quality of life in patients with
severe open fracture of the lower limb treated with negative pressure wound therapy
(NPWT) vs standard wound management after the first surgical debridement of the wound.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter randomized trial performed in the UK Major
Trauma Network, recruiting 460 patients aged 16 years or older with a severe open fracture
of the lower limb from July 2012 through December 2015. Final outcome data were collected
through November 2016. Exclusions were presentation more than 72 hours after injury and
inability to complete questionnaires.
INTERVENTIONS NPWT (n = 226) in which an open-cell solid foam or gauze was placed over
the surface of the wound and connected to a suction pump, creating a partial vacuum over
the dressing, vs standard dressings not involving application of negative pressure (n = 234).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Disability Rating Index score (range, 0 [no disability] to 100
[completely disabled]) at 12 months was the primary outcome measure, with a minimal
clinically important difference of 8 points. Secondary outcomes were complications including
deep infection and quality of life (score ranged from 1 [best possible] to −0.59 [worst
possible]; minimal clinically important difference, 0.08) collected at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.
RESULTS Among 460 patients who were randomized (mean age, 45.3 years; 74% men), 88%
(374/427) of available study participants completed the trial. There were no statistically
significant differences in the patients’Disability Rating Index score at 12 months (mean score,
45.5 in the NPWT group vs 42.4 in the standard dressing group; mean difference, −3.9 [95%
CI, −8.9 to 1.2]; P = .13), in the number of deep surgical site infections (16 [7.1%] in the NPWT
group vs 19 [8.1%] in the standard dressing group; difference, 1.0% [95% CI, −4.2% to 6.3%];
P = .64), or in quality of life between groups (difference in EuroQol 5-dimensions
questionnaire, 0.02 [95% CI, −0.05 to 0.08]; Short Form–12 Physical Component Score, 0.5
[95% CI, −3.1 to 4.1] and Mental Health Component Score, −0.4 [95% CI, −2.2 to 1.4]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with severe open fracture of the lower limb,
use of NPWT compared with standard wound dressing did not improve self-rated disability
at 12 months. The findings do not support this treatment for severe open fractures.

 F
ractures of the lower limb are common injuries in civil-
ian and military populations.1,2 Most fractures are
closed, meaning that the skin overlying the fracture is
intact. Open fractures exist when the broken bone is exposed
to contamination, resulting in a greatly increased risk of
complications.3 In severe open fractures of the lower limb,
infection rates up to 27% are reported, even in specialist
trauma centers.4 The costs of treating wound complications
is high for both patients and health care systems.5
The initial management of open fractures involves sur-
gical debridement with excision of damaged tissue, removal
of contamination, and antibiotic administration.6,7 The frac-
ture is usually immobilized with bone fixation and a dress-
ing is applied to the surface of the wound. Traditionally, a
sealed nonadhesive layer is applied to protect the open frac-
ture from further contamination. Reassessment and further
debridement of the wound are typically performed 48 to 72
hours later.
Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is an alterna-
tiveformofdressing.Thisdevicecreatesapartialvacuumusing
suction, which removes blood and fluid that may collect in the
wound. The vacuum may also encourage the formation of
granulation (healing) tissue.4,8 However, NPWT dressings and
the vacuum machines are considerably more expensive than
traditional wound dressings.
Before this study, there has been only 1 randomized clini-
cal trial comparing standard wound dressing with NPWT for
patients with open fractures of the lower limb.9 Improved out-
comes were suggested in patients treated with NPWT but the
study was not definitive because it included only 59 patients
treated at a single trauma center. Despite the lack of strong evi-
dence, clinical guidelines around the world have recom-
mended the use of NPWT for open fracture wounds.6,7,10
The aim of this pragmatic, multicenter randomized clini-
cal trial was to compare standard wound dressings with NPWT
for adults with an open fracture of the lower limb.
Methods
Study Design and Eligibility Criteria
The National Research Ethics Service approved the study, the
approved trial protocol and statistical analysis plan are avail-
able in Supplement 1 and Supplement 2, respectively. The trial
was overseen by independent steering and data and safety
monitoring committees.
The trial took place in 24 major trauma hospitals repre-
senting the UK Major Trauma Network; in the UK, patients
with serious injuries such as open fractures are transported
directly to a specialist trauma center with joint orthopedic
and plastic surgery facilities. Eligible patients were aged 16
years or older and had a severe open fracture of the lower
limb. Although not specified in the trial protocol, the oper-
ating surgeon assessed the wound and if it was decided that
the wound could not be closed, the patient was considered
eligible for study entry. Wounds were then graded as a
Gustilo and Anderson II or III wound; type II is an open frac-
ture with a laceration more than 1 cm long without exten-
sive soft-tissue damage, flaps, or avulsions and type III,
either an open segmental fracture or an open fracture with
extensive soft-tissue damage.11
Because surface NPWT can only be applied to wounds that
are left open, the surgeons could only include the most se-
vere injuries, ie, those in which it was not possible to safely
suture the wound edges at the end of the first surgical debride-
ment. Patients had to present to the trial hospital within 72
hoursoftheirinjury,includingthosewhoweretransferredfrom
other hospitals.
Patients were excluded if they had known contraindica-
tions to anesthesia or were deemed unable to adhere to trial
procedures or complete questionnaires, eg, those with a pre-
existing diagnosis of dementia. For patients who were acutely
confused or had temporary impairment of consciousness,
a consultee was approached to provide agreement on behalf
of the patient, as per the UK Mental Capacity Act 2005. All
participants randomized under this provision were subse-
quently approached for consent once capacity was restored,
with the option to continue or discontinue involvement in
the trial. For this reason, we anticipated higher levels of post-
randomization withdrawal than might be expected in most
clinical trials.
Randomization and Masking
A computer-generated randomization algorithm was cre-
ated by the trial statistician and delivered by an accredited
Clinical Trials Unit to ensure that the allocation sequence
was concealed. The individual patient was allocated treat-
ment on a 1:1 basis, stratified by trial center and Gustilo and
Anderson grade. When a patient entered the trial, noniden-
tifiable details were logged on the secure, encrypted, web-
based system.
Participants were assigned to their treatment allocation
intraoperatively at the end of initial surgery, but before any
wound dressing was applied. It was not possible to blind
trial participants to treatment allocation as wound dressings
were clearly visible. In addition, the treating surgeons could
not be blind to the intervention, but the surgical and health
care teams were not involved in any trial assessments.
Wound photographs taken at 6 weeks and standard radio-
graphs were used to look for signs of delayed wound healing
Key Points
Question Does either negative pressure wound therapy or
standard wound dressing result in less disability 12 months after
sustaining an open fracture of the lower limb?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 460 adults,
there was no statistically significant difference in self-rated
disability between negative pressure wound therapy or
standard wound dressing at 12 months (45.5 vs 42.4 points
of a possible 100).
Meaning Negative pressure wound therapy did not improve
12-month disability for patients with severe open fracture of the
lower limb compared with standard wound dressing.

 and nonunion of the bone, respectively. These were re-
viewed by independent clinicians who were blind to the
treatment allocation.
Interventions
At presentation, all patients were listed for the next avail-
able trauma operating list. In the operating theater, all
patients received a general or regional anesthetic. The
wound associated with the fracture was surgically debrided
and the fracture immobilized with either internal (under
the skin) or external fixation. At the end of the initial opera-
tion, if the wound could not be closed primarily, ie, direct
suture of the wound edges was not possible, the patient
was randomized to either standard dressings or NPWT. All
other elements of postoperative care remained the same for
all patients.
Standard Dressing Group
All hospitals used a sterile dressing sealed from external con-
tamination. However, the details of the materials used were
left to the discretion of the treating health care team as per rou-
tine care at their center. Details of each dressing applied in the
trial were recorded and classified according to British Na-
tional Formulary classification.
NPWT Group
The NPWT dressing used an open-cell solid foam or gauze laid
onto the wound followed by an adherent sealed dressing.
A sealed tube was connected from the dressing to a suction
pump, which created a partial vacuum over the wound. The
basic features of the NPWT are universal, but the exact de-
tails of the dressing and pressure (mm Hg) were left to the dis-
cretion of the treating health care team. Details of the NPWT
were recorded in trial documentation. Patients with an open
fracture of the lower limb that could not be closed primarily
hadasecondoperationat48to72hours,whenafurtherwound
assessment and debridement was performed and the wound
closed either primarily with sutures or by soft-tissue recon-
struction as necessary.
Data Collection and Outcome Measures
The primary outcome was the patient-reported Disability
RatingIndex(DRI)at12monthsafterrandomization.12TheDRI
provides a 100-point score, in which zero represents normal
function and 100, complete disability, with a minimum clini-
cally important difference of 8 points.
Secondary outcomes were health-related quality of
life using EuroQol 5-dimension, 3-level questionnaire
(EQ-5D-3L)13,14 and Short Form–12 (SF-12)15,16 deep surgical
site infection (SSI) at 30 days as per the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention definition17 and other complica-
tions. EQ-5D-3L responses were converted into an overall
utility score14 that ranged from 1 (best possible) to −0.59
(worst possible), in which zero represents the quality of life
associated with death; the minimum clinically important
difference is 0.08 points. Physical and Mental Health Com-
ponent Scores were computed from SF-12 responses18; these
scores range from 0 to 100, in which a zero score indicates
the lowest level of health. Infection outcomes and compli-
cations were extracted from the patients’medical records
by independent research staff in each trial center. Wound
photographs and radiographs were reviewed independently
and blind to treatment allocation.
Deep infection following an open fracture is a key driver
of subsequent disability. However, a deep infection that is
treated early and definitively may resolve completely with no
disability. Similarly, wounds that are not infected may still
heal with excess scar tissue or require extensive tissue grafts,
which can lead to reduced mobility and chronic pain. There-
fore, the DRI was considered to be more important as a pri-
mary outcome measure than the rate of deep infection or size
of the wound per se. Patient-reported outcomes (DRI, EQ-5D-
3L, SF-12) and self-reported complications were collected by
questionnaire. Preinjury baseline scores were collected retro-
spectively at the time of consent and again by postal ques-
tionnaire at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.
Statistical Analysis
A minimum clinically important difference for the DRI of 8
points was selected to power the study19; for an individual pa-
tient,thisrepresentsthedifferencebetweentheabilitytoclimb
stairs or run with “some difficulty” vs “great difficulty” and
at the population level, 8 points represents the difference be-
tween a “healthy patient” (score = 1 point) and a “patient with
a minor disability” (score = 9 points). The SD of the DRI used
in the sample size calculation was 25 points. Allowing a mar-
gin of 10% loss during follow-up, including the small number
of patients who die in the first year following their injury, gave
atotalsamplesizeof460patients.Therefore,230patientscon-
senting to each intervention group would provide 90% power
to detect a difference of 8 points in DRI at 12 months at the 5%
significance level.
When calculating summary statistics for assessing treat-
ment efficacy, NPWT data were subtracted from control
group data, such that a positive difference indicated that a
score or outcome measure was larger in the control group.
We investigated differences in the primary outcome mea-
sure, the DRI score at 1 year after injury, between the 2 treat-
ment groups on an intention-to-treat basis. Early and mid-
term disability was assessed and reported at 3, 6, and 9
months. A secondary per-treatment analysis was also per-
formed. Mixed-effects regression analysis, with recruiting
center as a random effect, and fixed terms to adjust for age
group, sex, baseline preinjury score, and Gustilo and Ander-
son grade was used to test for treatment group differences
using complete case data. Secondary end points were not
adjusted for multiple comparisons and should be inter-
preted as exploratory. In a post hoc sensitivity analysis for
the primary outcome, missing data were imputed using the
chained equation method20 and models fitted to give a
pooled estimate of the treatment effect.
All tests were 2-sided and significance was assessed at the
5% level. Analyses of primary and secondary outcomes used
complete-case data and all analyses were implemented in
R version 3.3.021 using packages base, graphics, mice, lme4,
and nlme (https://cran.r-project.org/).

 Results
A total of 625 patients were randomized between July 2012
and December 2015. Some patients were cognitively
impaired before surgery and were unable or not willing to
provide informed consent after randomization. Most of the
165 patients who did not provide consent were found to be
ineligible after randomization, eg, due to primary closure of
the wound or permanent cognitive impairment that could
not be predicted before surgery/randomization. Only 29
potentially eligible patients declined to participate in the
trial; 14 in the NPWT group and 15 in the standard dressing
group (Figure 1). A total of 460 patients consented to take
part in the Wound Management of Open Lower Limb Frac-
tures (WOLLF) Trial: 85% were grade III injuries and 82%
involved the tibia. The characteristics of the 2 groups were
well balanced after randomization (Table 1).
On an intention-to-treat basis, there was no significant
difference in the DRI score at 12 months between those
patients treated with NPWT vs those treated with standard
wound dressings (Figure 2). The mean DRI in the NPWT
group was 45.5 vs 42.4 in the standard dressing group, result-
ing in a difference of −3.9 (95% CI, −8.9 to 1.2) in favor of
standard dressings (P = .13; from adjusted mixed-effect
regression analysis) (Table 2). Therefore, the results of this
trial are consistent with a −8.9 worse disability rating attrib-
utable to the use of NPWT, which, based on the minimal
clinically important difference, would be clinically important
but also ranging to a nonclinically important benefit of these
dressings of 1.2 points on the DRI scale. Similarly, there was
no significant difference in disability rating at 3, 6, or 9
months (Figure 2).
Thesecondaryper-protocol(per-treatment)analysisofthe
DRI did not significantly differ from the primary intention-to-
treat analysis; the difference between groups being −4.0 (95%
CI, −9.1 to 1.0) in favor of the standard dressings (P=.12).
Secondary exploratory analysis showed that there was
no significant difference in the health-related quality-of-life
scores between the treatment groups at any point in the
12 months following the injury. The mean (SD) SF-12 Physical
Component Score at 12 months in the NPWT group was
32.2 (17.4) vs 32.7 (15.5) in the standard dressing group,
resulting in an adjusted difference of 0.4 (95% CI, −3.0 to 3.8)
in favor of standard dressings (P = .82; from adjusted mixed-
effect regression analysis). The mean (SD) EQ-5D-3L score
in the NPWT group was 0.55 (0.33) vs 0.56 (0.32) in the stan-
dard dressing group, resulting in a difference of 0.01
(95% CI, −0.06 to 0.07) in favor of standard dressing (P = .82)
(Table 2).

 resulting in an odds ratio of 1.1 (95% CI, 0.7 to 1.9; P = .68)
and difference in rates of 2.3% (95% CI, −8.4% to 13.0%).
The primary outcome data were 88% complete (374 of
427 available study participants provided final outcome
data) and there was no evidence for nonrandom patterns of
missingness. Imputing missing data gave pooled estimates
of the treatment effect for DRI at 12 months as −4.5 (95% CI,

able to the uncertainty caused by the missing data esti-
mated at 12.8%.
Discussion
This multicenter trial of patients with severe open fractures
of the lower limb found no significant difference in the DRI
score between those patients treated with NPWT vs those
treated with standard wound dressings at 12 months after in-
jury. There was no significant difference in the rate of deep sur-
gicalsiteinfectionorotherhealingcomplications,norwasthere
a significant difference in health-related quality of life at any
point in the first 12 months after the injury.
Before performing this trial, a review of the literature22
revealed only 1 randomized clinical trial comparing stan-
dard wound dressing with NPWT for the initial management
of patients with severe open fractures of the lower limb.
Stannard et al9 demonstrated a difference in health-related
quality of life and a reduction in the rate of deep wound
infection in patients treated with NPWT compared with
control (5.4% vs 20%; relative risk, 0.20 [95% CI, 0.05 to
0.87]). However, this was a small trial (59 patients, 63 frac-
tures), and there were only 7 deep infections in the control
group and 2 in the NPWT group. It is possible that this dif-
ference in the rate of deep infection was due to systematic
differences in the patients and/or treatment pathway in a
single center in the United States compared with the WOLLF
trial, which took place in the much broader setting of 24
major trauma centers. However, given the relatively small
number of cases in the Stannard et al9 trial, it is possible
that the result represents a lack of precision in the estimate
of the incidence of deep infection.
A trial published in 2016 also compared NPWT with
standard dressings for the management of open fractures.
This study was performed in Pakistan and used negative
pressure dressings over a prolonged period (weeks) to
reduce the size of the wound.23 This is a very different use
of NPWT than advocated by current guidance for the man-
agement of open fractures, in which early definitive wound
closure—within 72 hours—is recommended.6,7 Therefore, it
is not clear whether the results of that trial are pertinent to
other health care systems.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, patients with an open
fracture of the lower limb have usually experienced severe
trauma and present to hospital with variable states of con-
sciousness and cognition. For emergency interventions, it was
anticipated that some patients who were randomized would

 subsequently be found not eligible or not able to provide in-
formed consent, eg, patients who had significant head injury
or who died of their injuries in the early postoperative pe-
riod. Some patients were also found to be ineligible after ran-
domization due to the surgeon deciding that the wound could
be closed by direct suturing, which may reflect the difficul-
ties of classifying these injuries at the time of the initial de-
bridement of the wound; only patients whom the surgeon
thought that the wound had to be left open were included in
the trial.24 However, 460 of the 485 patients (95%) who were
randomized and eligible for the trial agreed to participate, sug-
gesting that participants were representative of the overall
population with severe open fractures of the lower limb.
Second, after randomization, some patients crossed over
from one treatment group to another. However, 95% of pa-
tients received the treatment to which they were allocated.
Third, there was loss to follow-up, with study comple-
tion by only 88% of the original participants. However, mul-
tiple imputation analysis resulted in consistent findings.
Fourth, although patients were only eligible to enter the
study if they presented to the treating hospital within 72
hours of their injury, adjustment could not be made for the
exact time of the open fracture, which is a possible con-
founder in the analysis.
Conclusions
Among patients with severe open fracture of the lower limb,
use of NPWT compared with standard wound dressing did not
improve self-rated disability at 12 months. The findings do not
support this treatment for severe open fractures.
