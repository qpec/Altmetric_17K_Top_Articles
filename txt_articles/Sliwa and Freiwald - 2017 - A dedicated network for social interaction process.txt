A dedicated network for social
interaction processing in the
primate brain
J. Sliwa* and W. A. Freiwald*
Primate cognition requires interaction processing. Interactions can reveal otherwise
hidden properties of intentional agents, such as thoughts and feelings, and of inanimate
objects, such as mass and material. Where and how interaction analyses are implemented
in the brain is unknown. Using whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging in
macaque monkeys, we discovered a network centered in the medial and ventrolateral
prefrontal cortex that is exclusively engaged in social interaction analysis. Exclusivity of
specialization was found for no other function anywhere in the brain. Two additional
networks, a parieto-premotor and a temporal one, exhibited both social and physical
interaction preference, which, in the temporal lobe, mapped onto a fine-grain pattern of
object, body, and face selectivity. Extent and location of a dedicated system for social
interaction analysis suggest that this function is an evolutionary forerunner of human
mind-reading capabilities.
R
ecognizing physical objects and intentional
agents, their actions, and their interactions
is essential for understanding the world
around us (Fig. 1A) (1–3). Monkeys recog-
nize social interactions and their meaning
quickly and effortlessly; they understand groom-
ing, play, and fight, infer social rank from inter-
actions, and use this knowledge to recruit allies
(4, 5). Monkeys also understand that colliding
objects exchange forces and make use of gravity
and trajectory cues to search for falling food (6, 7).
Understanding interactions is a core cognitive
component in primates (3, 8). Yet, little is known
about the neural circuitry that underlies interac-
tion processing. To chart the brain regions that
process social and physical interactions, we pre-
sented naturalistic videos during whole-brain func-
tional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to four
rhesus monkeys (supplementary materials, mate-
rials and methods). We used six main types of
videos: (i) social interactions between monkeys,
(ii) physical interactions between objects, (iii)
monkeys engaged in independent goal-directed
behaviors, (iv) objects moving independently, (v)
nonacting monkeys, and (vi) stationary objects,
along with low-level motion control and natural
complex scene videos (Fig. 1B, movies S1 and S2,
and materials and methods). Real-world videos
were chosen to maximize cognitive engagement.
For data analysis, we controlled for eye move-
ments and visual motion energy through nui-
sance regression in the generalized linear model
(GLM) and inspected several other behavioral
features (figs. S1 and S2 and materials and meth-
ods). Brain activity for agents’ shape, actions, and
social interactions and for objects’ interactions
was defined as compared with matched control
conditions with conjunction analyses (Fig. 1C
and materials and methods).
Temporal and prefrontal cortices contain areas
selective for specific categories of visual shapes
such as faces, bodies, or objects (9–11) and for
shapes of particular categories set in motion
(12–14). Because interactions reveal hidden fea-
tures of agents and objects (for example, object
mass and material during collision), some agent/
object category or agent/object-motion selective
areas might be specifically engaged by interactions.

Fig. 2. From agents to actions to interactions. (A) Statistical map of enhanced
activation for the Agents contrast. Shown is an inflated F99 cortical model of
the right hemisphere, with dark gray regions representing sulci and light gray
regions representing gyri (P < 0.01, FDR-corrected for multiple comparisons).
The fMRI signal is enhanced in regions of the STS and frontal cortex that
overlap with face and body patches independently identified (fig. S3A).
(B) Agent-object interactions assessed with the contrast (actions > agents)
show enhanced activation of the body but not face patches. Bar plots are
normalized signal changes for the contrast. Error bars represent SD (*P < 0.05,
**P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001; all other comparisons are not significant; Holm-
Bonferroni–corrected for multiple comparison). (C) Same as (B). Agent-agent
interactions assessed with the contrast (social interactions > actions)
show both body and face patches enhanced activation. (D) Same as (B).Object-
object interactions assessed with the contrast (physical interactions > social
interactions) show that only object patches are more activated by physical than
social interactions. (E) Statistical map of enhanced activation for the action
contrast [same conventions as in (A)]. Significant activation is found in
the parietal and premotor cortices in addition to the STS, in regions that overlap
with classical MNS areas independently identified (fig. S3B). (F) Brain
activity for social interactions compared with agents and landscapes and
scramble controls shows a similar overlap. (G) Brain activity for physical
interactions compared with objects moving independently and landscapes and
scramble controls shows a similar overlap. (H) Overlaid activations for action,
social interaction, and physical interaction contrasts showing MNS recruitment
by different types of interactions. (I) Statistical map of enhanced activation
for the social interaction contrast [same conventions as in (A)] showing an
extended network of regions significantly active for watching social interactions.
Significant activation is found in the medial and dorsomedial prefrontal
cortices (mPFC and dmPFC), in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC),
in the temporal pole (TP), and in parietal areas (7a), in addition to activation
in the STS and in the parietal and premotor cortices. (J) Same map presented on

 We therefore first mapped canonical face, body,
and object patches with a standard localizer
(fig. S3A) (10) and then measured responses to
naturalistic videos. Videos of inactive, active,
and interacting monkeys all engaged classical face
and body areas in the superior temporal sulcus
(STS) and prefrontal cortex [P < 0.01, false dis-
covery rate (FDR) corrected for multiple compar-
isons] (Fig. 2A and figs. S5 and S6) (14), and
naturalistic videos of still, moving, and colliding
objects activated regions overlapping with object
patches. Region of interest (ROI) analysis re-
vealed that category-selective areas differentiate
between interaction types: agent-object interac-
tions (agents performing goal-directed actions
directedatobjectscomparedwithnonactingagents)
recruited body patches but not face patches [with
the exception of area prefrontal orbital (PO) and
face-motion area middle dorsal (MD) (13); area
middle fundus (MF) showed even less activation]
(Fig. 2B); social interactions recruited both face
and body patches (Fig. 2, C and D); and object-
object interactions selectively recruited part of
object patches only [for all, Student’s t tests, Holm-
Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons by
using family-wise error (FWE) rate at P < 0.05]
(Fig. 2D). Thus, interaction-preference followed
the fine-grain spatial organization for object catego-
ries: Even directly neighboring face and body areas
differentiated between interaction types composed
of the same category elements, faces and bodies.
Social and physical interactions engaged two
additional areas, none of which were activated by
noninteracting stimuli (agents or objects). These
areas were located outside regions selective for
faces, bodies, or objects discussed above: One area
was located in the posterior portion of anterior
intraparietal area (pAIP), and one in premotor
area F5 (Student’s t test, P < 0.01 FDR voxel-wise)
(Fig. 2E and figs. S5 and S6). Both areas were
activated by agent-object interactions (Fig. 2E)
but also by object-object interactions, and even
more strongly by social interactions (Fig. 2, F
and G). Both areas did not respond to movies of
inactive monkeys (Fig. 2A) nor to independent-
ly moving objects, further emphasizing their
interaction-selectivity. Social and physical in-
teraction representations overlapped in F5 but
occupied neighboring locations within pAIP
(Fig. 2, F to H). The anterior part of pAIP appeared
even more activated by physical than any other
type of interaction (Fig. 2H). The parieto-frontal
cortex contains the mirror neuron system (MNS)
(15). The classical MNS can be mapped in mon-
keys with fMRI by using videos of humans grasp-
ing objects (16). When mapping the MNS in this
way (fig. S3B and movie S3), it colocalized with
pAIP and F5 interaction areas (Fig. 2, E to H).
The MNS is thus engaged by three very different
kinds of interactions, including the one it had been
known for. If the MNS supports understanding of
another agent’s actions upon objects (15), then by
extension these findings imply a general role of the
MNS for social and physical-world understanding.
As social-cognitive species, primates under-
stand the social interactions of others (4, 5). Social
interactions, but not physical ones, activated a
large set of brain regions beyond the category-
selective networks and the MNS (Fig. 2, I to N).
This social-interaction network (SIN) included
parts of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)
and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (areas 32 and
10mr, and24b, respectively), dorsomedial prefrontal
cortex (dmPFC) (areas F6 or Pre-SMA, 8Bm, and
9m), a temporo-parietal cluster (areas TPOc and
7a), parts of the ventro-lateral prefrontal cortex
(vlPFC) (ventral part of F5, ventral part of 44, the
posterior part of 47 and 12, and OPro), temporal
pole regions (TPOi, STS areas 1 and 2, and TPpro),
the perirhinal cortex (36R), dorsal STS areas [so-
cial posterior dorsal (sPD) and social anterior dorsal
(sAD), located dorsally to posterior lateral (PL) and
anterior fundus (AF) face patches, and anterior
dorsal (AD), a face patch located dorsally to face

 patch AF], and cortical and subcortical systems
engaged in reward, valence, and emotional pro-
cessing [caudate; amygdala; and areas 10o, 11l,
and 14r of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)] (figs.
S5, A and D, and S6, A and D).
Large parts of the SIN network were exclu-
sively selective for social interactions and did not
respond to any other stimulus condition in the
context of the present design. Areas of this ex-
clusively social interaction network (ESIN) in-
cluded a cluster in mPFC, ACC, and dmPFC; a
cluster in vlPFC; area 7a in the inferior parietal
lobule; and OFC areas 10o and 14r (Fig. 3, A and
C, and figs. S5, A and E, and S6, A and E). The
ESIN was even deactivated in all but the social
interaction conditions (Fig. 3D). We did not find
such exclusivity of functional specialization for
any other stimulus category anywhere in the brain.
However, the joint characteristic of the ESIN—
social cognition focus and general deactivation
during visual stimulation—bear resemblance to
the human theory of mind (ToM) and the human
default mode network (DMN) (17, 18). Curiously,
ToM and DMN intersect in the human brain at
regions of quite plausible homology to ESIN areas
of the macaque brain. Thus, the macaque ESIN
shares functional and anatomical characteristics
of human ToM and ESIN (fig. S4).
We found three networks engaged in interac-
tion analyses, each with distinct functional char-
acteristics and internal organization. Are there
overarching principles of organization for all areas
processing interactions? We conducted principal
component analysis (PCA) across the different
movie categories on 43 regions of interest (Fig.
4, A and C). The areas in this space could be
grouped into object, body, and face patches and
classical MNS, SIN (without the ESIN), and ESIN.
This analysis, as well as an analysis of correlation
distances to the classical MNS and ESIN (Fig. 4B),
showed a greater similarity of face patches to the
ESIN than any to other ROIs. Because of their
functional homogeneity, we then performed PCA
in each of the six aforementioned groups of brain
areas across the same stimulus conditions (Fig.
4D). SIN and ESIN separated the social interac-
tion condition from all others along PC1. They
did not differentiate the other two agency condi-
tions (“acting” and “nonacting”) along this dimen-
sion. Both properties were shared by the face
patches (Fig. 4D). The body patches, instead,
separated all three agency conditions along PC1
and the three object conditions jointly along PC2
and PC1. This functional similarity suggests that
face patches are putative entry points to the SIN
and ESIN. Body and object patches turned out to
be functionally related to the MNS (Fig. 4, A, B,
and D). It has been proposed that the MNS might
provide inputs to the ToM network in humans
(19). Functionally, however, the MNS differed sub-
stantially from the SIN and ESIN and was more
similar to object and body patches, whereas the
SIN and ESIN were closer to face areas (Fig. 4,
A, B, and D). Therefore, interaction analysis by
two streams—already segregating inside the STS
and feeding into the classical MNS and SIN,
respectively—with different functions is the most
plausible model for the organization of high-level
world-processing in the primate brain.
Visual analysis of interactions is a computa-
tionally daunting problem: Each interaction
generates a complex spatiotemporal flow pat-
tern, each interaction category consists of many
different such patterns, and even the smallest
change to a pattern can change an interaction’s

Colors and dashed contours indicate each brain area’s identity. Areas that
are defined independently of the main task (object patches, face patches,
object patches, or MNS) tend to cluster separately. A gradient of similarity
mainly along the first principal component (PC1) goes from the object

to the MNS, whereas face patches are more closely related to the ESIN.

 meaning. Yet, primates understand the mean-
ing of interactions effortlessly. To meet these
computational challenges, which are even more
demanding than those of invariant object recog-
nition, a neural machinery at least as extensive
as that for object recognition seems necessary.
Our finding that large parts of shape-selective
STS are interaction-selective and that the fine-
grain pattern of interaction selectivity closely fol-
lows that of shape selectivity provides a possible
answer to the puzzle of where visual interaction
analysis takes place: The same machinery may
perform both shape and interaction analyses,
possibly parsing different results into MNS and
SIN. This organization is markedly different from
how motion activates the same region (13, 14) and
revealshowdeeplyinteractionanalysisisingrained
in visual circuitry.
The MNS is thought to add depth to the pro-
cessing of agent-object interactions by uncovering
motor intentions behind observed object-directed
actions and to do so through a process of sim-
ulation (15). Our results of broad MNS involve-
ment across physical and social interactions can
be parsimoniously interpreted by extension; the
MNS would uncover through causal model sim-
ulations the hidden properties of physical objects
and intentional agents and automatically reveal
the wide set of affordances [action possibilities
(20)] they offer for online engagement. The MNS
would, according to this scenario, not just func-
tion in motor intention processing but play a
major role in supporting general core cognitive
functions of intuitive physics and psychology.
We report the existence of large regions of the
monkey brain exclusively engaged in social inter-
action analysis. The monkey ESIN parallels prop-
erties of DMN (18) and ToM systems in humans
(17) and even occupies locations very similar to
regions of intersection of human DMN and ToM.
Because of the known role of ToM areas in social
theory–driven deductions (17, 21), some parts of
the monkey ESIN might play a role in elabora-
ting, storing, and comparing species-specific
socio-emotional scripts stipulating rules of social
conduct (4, 5), whereas other parts might deduce
inferences about other agents’ mental, emotion-
al, and intentional states that explain their ob-
served interactions.
The results of this study reveal a new dimen-
sion of tuning and functional organization of
the STS, redefine the role of the mirror neuron
system, and uncover the existence of a new high-
level social cognition network with deep evolu-
tionary heritage.
