Abstract: With China’s significant role on pollution emissions and related health damage, deep
and up-to-date understanding of China’s air pollution policies is of worldwide relevance. Based on
scientific evidence for the evolution of air pollution and the institutional background of environmental
governance in China, we examine the development of air pollution control policies from the 1980s
and onwards. We show that: (1) The early policies, until 2005, were ineffective at reducing emissions;
(2) During 2006–2012, new instruments which interact with political incentives were introduced in the
11th Five-Year Plan, and the national goal of reducing total sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions by 10% was
achieved. However, regional compound air pollution problems dominated by fine particulate matter
(PM2.5) and ground level ozone (O3) emerged and worsened; (3) After the winter-long PM2.5 episode
in eastern China in 2013, air pollution control policies have been experiencing significant changes on
multiple fronts. In this work we analyze the different policy changes, the drivers of changes and key
factors influencing the effectiveness of policies in these three stages. Lessons derived from the policy
evolution have implications for future studies, as well as further reforming the management scheme
towards air quality and health risk oriented directions.

1. Introduction
Air pollution in China has been very severe, causing huge health damages and social losses
for a long time.
In the meantime air pollution control polices have over the last couple of
decades experienced profound changes, especially a transition from weak to strong implementation.
Recently air pollution in China has evolved into an issue of wide and politically prioritized concern.
National large-scale polices have been initiated and implemented, such as the Air Pollution Prevention
and Control Action Plan (hereinafter the Action Plan) [1]. It is well known that energy (or more
precisely coal) is the primary source of air pollution and carbon emissions in China, and the closely
related energy and climate polices are also experiencing significant changes.
People who wish to take a closer look beneath the surface of China’s air pollution control policies
are immediately faced with difficulties. Research-based information is scattered in several lines of the
literature: scientific publications in disciplines such as atmospheric chemistry require some discipline
specific expertise of readers. Reviews by experts in these disciplines focus more on air pollution itself,
and the policy-relevant discussions provided are broad, and from a national perspective (e.g., [2–4]).
Environmental governance and law literatures usually discuss Chinese environmental regulation as
a whole, seldom discussing air pollution control policies independently (e.g., [5–8]). Environmental
economics studies mostly provide a descriptive background of air pollution control and then focus on

individual policies (e.g., [9–11]). There are recent Chinese empirical studies (e.g., [12–16]) and some
reports on air pollution control policies mentioning the latest developments. However, aside from
some short commentaries (e.g., [17]), more detailed, systematic follow-ups are rarely seen.
This paper aims to provide an updated and in more depth review of the Chinese air pollution
situation and its related policies from the 1980s and onwards, and to show that air pollution control
policies in China are experiencing profound changes. With China’s significant role on air pollution,
deep and up-to-date understanding of China’s air pollution policies is of great relevance. Moreover, as
they did undergo several significant and different regulatory changes the empirical evidence provides
opportunities to learn from these experiences.
The paper is structured as follows: the next two sections first describe the air pollution status
and its trends, and then the environmental regulatory system. With these scientific and institutional
backgrounds we then describe the three stages of air pollution control polices. We discuss the driving
factors for policy changes and conclude by summarizing trends and challenges for the future. It is
important to first note that in this review we focus on policies that directly target air pollution.
Air pollution is closely related to some other key challenges for China, e.g., climate change, energy
and regional cooperation, therefore also related with energy and climate policies. However, during
most of the time period which this review covers, the air pollution control policy process in China has
been relatively independent of climate or energy policy process. Recently this has changed and with
processes being more integrated, a trend that we discuss in Section 5.2.
2. Air Pollution Status and Evolution
In China, the major air pollution problems have been mainly attributable to coal burning and
industry processes during the early stage of economic development. Recently vehicle emissions have
become an increasing problem in urban areas, especially the megacities. A reduction of primary
pollutants (primary pollutants are directly emitted from certain sources; secondary pollutants are
formed in atmospheric chemistry reactions), e.g., sulfur dioxide (SO2), in terms of emission and
concentration has been observed, but a more complex, regional air pollution problem dominated by
fine particulate matter (PM2.5; total suspended particulates (TSP) include all particulate matters (PMs)
with different aerodynamic diameters) and ground level ozone (O3) has emerged.
2.1. Air Pollution Status and Social Impact
Chinese economic growth has been powered by a coal-dominated surging fossil fuel consumption
resulting in the highest emission levels for such as carbon dioxide (CO2), SO2, nitrogen oxides (NOx)
and primary PM in the world. Regional uneven development concentrates most of the population,
economic activities, and emissions in eastern and central China, resulting in an overall severe air
pollution situation in these regions, with its city clusters being most heavily affected. The ambient
air pollution in China has been estimated by the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) to lead to
1.2 million premature deaths from one year’s (2010) exposure in China [18], and in multiple studies to
cause annual economic loses equivalent to between 1% and 7% of China’s GDP [12], partially or even
totally offsetting China’s current annual GDP growth.
2.2. Total Emission, Emission Intensity, Air Quality and Health Damage Trends
The two, for long regulated, emissions SO2 and TSP (including PM10, in this paper referred to
“smoke and dust” in statistics yearbooks) have passed their peak and are diminishing (Figure 1a), and
their concentrations have significantly declined [19,20] (Figure 2a,c). Meanwhile, the less regulated
NOx has continued to increase in emission (Figure 1a), with the NOx concentration being stable
(Figure 2c and in [21]). For these primary pollutants, their emission intensities indicated by emissions
per unit of GDP have declined (Figure 1b).

under very high concentration of PM2.5 and O3 [34,35]. Ambient air pollution in the form of PM2.5
and O3 leads to more significant public health effects compared to that of primary pollutants [18,36].
The GBD estimated China’s annual premature deaths attributable to PM2.5 and O3 have remained
high, summing average values of around 1 to 1.2 million deaths from 1990 to 2015 (Figure 3).

and O3 leads to more significant public health effects compared to that of primary pollutants [18,36].

the estimated base value, bars show lower and upper bound of estimates. Based on data in the Global 
Burden of Disease Study 2015 [37]. Note the different scales of the vertical axes in (a,b). 
2.3. Atmospheric Chemistry Explanation and Emission Source Changes 
The very high levels and spreading trend of PM2.5 and O3 are the result of an expanding 
secondary particle production atmospheric chemical reaction process, with increasing amounts of 
reactants and accelerated reaction rates due to the higher oxidation capacity. A concise scientific 
explanation for this is “air pollution complex” (or compound/complicated/complex pollution, a 
concept formally proposed and defined by Tang in 1997, and was further explained and developed 
in [38]). 
O3 is formed by the reactions of NOx and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) under solar 
radiation. Areas of elevated fine particulate concentrations can also form downwind of the precursor 
source areas if there is considerable movement of air. More importantly, atmospheric oxidation 
capacities are enhanced by increasing O3 concentrations. Thus, SO2, NOx, and VOCs will be 
transformed into PM2.5 more efficiently where O3 concentrations are higher due to increased rates of 
oxidation. 
This motivates a further look at the changes of emission sources by, as generally defined, three 
stages: (1) In 1970–1990, the dominant contributing sources were big and small coal burning stoves 
widely used in power plants, industry, utilities and households. Coal smoke mainly contains SO2, 
TSP, but also NOX and carbon monoxide (CO). Other sources, such as dust from construction site 
mainly consisting of primary PMs, contributed less; (2) During the transition period 1990–2000 the 
growing number of vehicles, mainly in mega cities contributed a lot to the increase in NOx and VOCs 
(for example, vehicles were found to contribute to about 30%–56% of total Pearl River Delta regional 
NOx and Non-Methane VOC emissions [39,40]) which were added to the previous problems [38]. As 
a result, secondary PM2.5, and O3 increased, the “air pollution complex” took shape, with various 
primary and secondary pollutants involved in the atmospheric chemical reactions; (3) From 2000 to 
the present, the compound air pollution is ingrained in the megacities and spreading to the regional 
level, corresponding to the trends that vehicle ownership continues to soar and expand to

level, corresponding to the trends that vehicle ownership continues to soar and expand to surrounding
areas of the cities. On the national level coal burning is still dominant in contributing to the primary
pollutant emissions [41], whereas for megacities local specific source apportionments show that none of
the contributions from various sectors such as coal burning, vehicles, construction site dust, industrial
processes, are possibly ignorable [42]. Moreover, regional transmission also plays an important role [43].
In China the air pollution situation is severe, widely distributed, and the atmospheric chemical
reactions complex. These characteristics indicate no easy solution and that any effective control strategy
has to target all the major pollutants from different sources, and control measures have to be jointly
designed and wisely combined. It is evident that China therefore faces different challenges than developed
countries, which experienced and solved different phases of air pollution for nearly a century.
3. Environmental Regulatory System
The institutional composition and dynamics of the environmental regulatory system in China is
key to understand the air pollution control policies. In this section we rely on accumulated knowledge
from the governance literature (e.g., [6,8,44,45]) to lay out the institutional and environmental
governance foundation for later sections. The environment regulatory system in China is viewed
as a very comprehensive regime.
However in most cases implementation and enforcement of
environmental regulations have been weak and questionable during the past decades. As an illustrative
summary, Figure 4 (discussed in more detail later) shows the institutional structures and the channels
through which the policies and government departments work.

surrounding areas of the cities. On the national level coal burning is still dominant in contributing to

3.1. Government Institutions Foretell the Implementation Difficulty
Chinese governance is departmental-regional fragmented. The regional dimension spreads
from central government (the red area in Figure 4) to jurisdictional-based local governments.
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2016, 13, 1219
6 of 22
The departmental dimension contains each ministry in the central government and the same functional
agency in local government layers (e.g., from the Ministry of Environment (MEP) to local environmental
protection bureaus (EPB), the green area in Figure 4). Among the local officials, the chief leaders
of the Party Committee and the Government (e.g., at municipal level, party secretary, vice-party
secretary, mayor and vice-mayor) are the ones in charge of public affairs within their geographic
jurisdiction. They also manage the allocation of personnel and money among different bureaus in
the local government (orange area in Figure 4). As they are largely promotion driven, their limited
attention and the tradeoffs in resource allocation are naturally influenced by the incentives given by
the promotion mechanisms.
Promotion of local officials in China is a complicated “cadre evaluation” process in the
Five-Year-Plan (FYP) framework (see, e.g., [8]). The FYPs are a cycle process starting from the release of
a series of social and economic development initiatives by the central government, among which many
goals are “administratively subcontracted” [44] to local governments. The bureaucratic personnel are
supposed to fulfil these directives and be evaluated on these upper assigned tasks and eventually will
be promoted or not. Some key characteristics of this process are: (1) the ones getting higher rankings
are more likely to be promoted; (2) the strongest promotion incentive is concentrated on the local main
leaders; and (3) though subcontracted tasks are numerous, covering most public areas, only economic
development (e.g., GDP) is tracked and veto-track factors largely determine the evaluation ranking.
A veto means that if the target is not fulfilled, there will definite be no chance for promotion, one
example was birth control targets.
Environmental protection is among the highly subcontracted jurisdictional obligations. However,
for a long time it was not included in the two emphasized tracks of factors in the promotion assessment.
Therefore the difficulties in its implementation are largely inherent and only in relatively rare cases
(shown as the special situations in Figure 4) will the local main leaders’ attention be temporarily
drawn to environmental issues, such as when certain environmental problems become severe and
urgent to the extent as to cause a veto, or somehow higher level of government mandates them to pay
attention. In “normal” situation EPBs work “alone” on local environment issues. Lack of attention is
compounded by the lack of capacity in EPBs, they hardly have a sufficient fiscal budget and personnel
for monitoring and enforcement.
Weak implementation as the overall result of the constraints is not destined to persist though.
When the rules of promotion are changed and the veto track factors begin to include environmental
ones, local main leaders have to pay attention. When these factors start being measured in a way that
cannot easily be hidden by other flexible measures (e.g., data fabrication, see, e.g., [46]), local main
leaders have to really implement the regulations. Further, when strong political pressure from the
central government is perceived by local governments, the latter may even “over implement” and
“innovatively implement”.
3.2. What Are the Environmental Policies?
China’s environmental policy system generally consists of broadly five series of polices (shown as
blue blocks in Figure 4), systematically intertwined in the departmental-regional government described
in Section 3.1. They are: (1) environmental laws, rules and standards; (2) national plans in the FYP
framework; (3) ten specific regulatory measures; (4) special actions outside the FYP framework; and
(5) environment-related state ideologies. As aforementioned, apart from environmental policies, energy
and climate policies are also highly relevant to air pollution, but for a long time they were part of
another relatively independent policy system in the context of climate changes and energy security
(for a review of this track of policies, see, e.g., [47]). Here we focus on environmental policies.
3.2.1. Environmental Laws and Standards
China has many environmental laws at different legislative levels. In 1978, the Third Chinese
Constitution was issued with inclusion of an environmental commission. The Environmental Protection
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2016, 13, 1219
7 of 22
Law was issued on a trial basis in 1979 and then formally in 1989. Subsequently China has issued
around 30 laws related to the environment (for example, the Law on the Prevention and Control
of Atmospheric Pollution), hundreds of administrative rules, and even more detailed standards.
Wang has reviewed environment law in China and summarized them as covering every aspect of
environment management, but to have low legislative quality, too many principles, being very basic
and difficult to actually enforce [48].
However, the various emission and environment quality standards in the environmental laws do
provide a quantitative summary of the development of China’s pollution control targets and measures.
Take air pollution control as an example, Table 1 lists representative standards on coal fired power
plants, coal-burning boilers, vehicles, and on air quality. From this table it becomes evident that these
standards in China were established early, even in the 1980s, and then were fixed or even loosened
(the air quality standard) around 2000. After a dozen of years (note that the PM2.5 crisis happened in
the winter between 2012 and 2013), these standards have been updated and significantly strengthened.
The current standards are largely in line with international ones and for power plants even more
stringent than those in developed countries such as the U.S. and Japan.

3.2.2. National Environmental Plans within the FYPs
National environmental planning within the FYPs framework started from scratch and now
dominates environmental governance in China [6]. Generally the more emphasized public areas
will have concrete chapters in the nationwide FYP, their goals will be more quantitatively articulated
and be supported with more focused FYPs, even with industry specific FYPs (e.g., the 11th FYP
on “National environment protection” and on “Coal fired power plants SO2 emission control” [50]).
Among the many public area targets, the solid type is “mandatory” targets. They are guaranteed to
be attained and implemented in advance [51]. These targets are decomposed and allocated to local
governments through the target responsibility agreement system and integrated to veto track factors
in cadre evaluation. Environmental protection entered the 6th FYP as an independent chapter and
became more specific and concrete in later FYPs [52]. The 11th FYP (2006–2010) is the milestone in
which for the first time several quantitative environmental and energy targets became mandatory [53].
3.2.3. Ten Specific Conventional Regulatory Measures
During the past decades, ten specific conventional regulatory measures have been solidified.
These measures are often referred to as “Old Three, New Five, Target Response and Total Emission
Control” (Old Three refers to 1 to 3 of the list, and were solidified between 1972 and 1979, New Five
refers to 4 to 8 and are solidified between 1980 and 1989. “Lao San Xiang, Xin Wuxiang, Mu Biao Ze Ren
Zhi, Zong Liang Kong Zhi” in Chinese) in China’s environmental management policy context [54,55].
Generally when talking about environmental regulatory implementation in China, it is one or several
of these measures being used:
1.
Construction project environmental impact assessment (EIA): Construction projects must conduct
EIAs before their construction. In 2003 this measure was expanded to including planning EIAs.
2.
“Three Simultaneously” (3S): Installations for the prevention and control of pollution at a construction
project must be designed, built and commissioned together with the principal part of the project.
3.
Pollution fees: When discharging pollutants in excess of the discharge standards, a fee shall be
paid for excessive discharge. In 2003 pollution fees became collectable on all the discharges and
no longer restricted to excessive discharge.
4.
Comprehensive quantitative evaluation of urban environment: A weighted grading system with
indicators covering all aspects of environment protection. Annual grading results with only
ranking information of about a hundred cities are made public.
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2016, 13, 1219
9 of 22
5.
Pollutant discharge permit: Polluting units shall discharge pollutants in accordance with their
permits. Certificates of pollutant discharge permit shall be applied at EPB, in which major
pollutants and information of discharge pipes are specified.
6.
Undertake treatment within a prescribed limit of time: The legislative institutions make decisions
that require companies, identified as being involved in heavy pollution, to dispose of the pollution
source within a time limit, to reach the specified disposal demanded.
7.
Centralized pollution control: Treatment facilities for polluting units within a limited area
are jointly planed, designed and operated, as an additional mechanism to the conventional
independently performed way.
8.
Cleaner production: Liable enterprises shall monitor resource consumption and generation
of wastes in production, and conduct cleaner production audits and report to the relevant
administrative departments in the local government.
9.
Environmental protection target responsibility system: Local governments at or above the county
level are responsible for environmental protection in their jurisdiction and the responsible persons
will be assessed on this in cadre evaluation.
10.
Total emission control: Within a limited time and area, aggregated emission quotas less than
a certain cap are allocated to local governments/targeted enterprises. Early trials were in the
“Acid Rain and SO2 Control Zone” [56]. Later this became a nationwide measure.
3.2.4. Special Actions outside the FYPs
China is able to quickly respond to all kinds of “situations” (e.g., crisis, special needs, and
environmental accidents) [6,57].
When the environment becomes deteriorated with the impact
acute to a certain level, special actions can temporarily relieve the ineffectiveness of regular policies.
Usually they are local, short-term administrative measures at any costs [58]. Sometimes, after a certain
situation is subsided, parts of these measures will be adopted at regional or national level and even be
integrated in later FYPs [6]. Some examples of special actions are the Environmental Law Enforcement
Inspection, believed to temporarily draw local main leaders’ attention to environment protection [44],
EIA Storm in order to partially rectify the common cases of “construction first and EIA later” [59], and
some radical actions in Beijing Blue Sky project when preparing for the 2008 Olympics and the Action
Plan as triggered by the PM2.5 crisis.
3.2.5. Environment Related State Ideologies
“State ideologies” in China are soft policies in the broad sense. On the surface they look like
slogans whereas they can reflect the central political consensus on some social issues and guide the
national planning. In terms of the possibility in deriving some concrete policies they may have very
different results. World-known and thoroughly implemented state ideologies are “Focus on Economic
Construction” and “Family Planning”. Historic experience shows that a dozen of environment-related
state ideologies (“Protect the Environment”, “Sustainable Development”, “Cleaner Production”,
“Circular Economy”, “Green GDP”, “Harmonious Society”, “Scientific Development”, “Beautiful
China”, “Low-Carbon Economy” and “Resource-Conserving and Environmentally Friendly Society”.
The latest one is “Ecological Civilization”) largely accomplished their mission as slogans, but from their
official interpretations, the “win-win” theme of environment protection and economy development
has become clearer over time [6].
3.3. An Illustrative Summary
We designed Figure 4 aiming to display the institutional structures, dynamics and policies in
a systematic way. However, it does not indicate a rigid environmental governance system, and does
not show some past and ongoing changes in this system. For example, the administrative rank of the
environment protection department in the central government has been increasing, from a working
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2016, 13, 1219
10 of 22
group in the 1970s all the way up to a ministry status in 2008. The Environment Protection Law, after
remaining unchanged for 25 years, has been amended in 2014 and some of the new law articles are
regarded as unprecedentedly strict [60]. Non-governmental actors, not shown in Figure 4, have been
granted the legal power to claim environmental rights [61], hence their role is increasing.
4. Three Stages of Air Pollution Control Policies in China
4.1. Until 2005, before the 11th Five-Year Plan
Based on previous trials focusing on eliminating industrial smoke and dust, the basic system
of air pollution control was established in the Law on the Prevention and Control of Atmospheric
Pollution, issued in 1987. The system can be summarized as: (1) local governments are responsible
for air pollution control within their jurisdiction; (2) a concentration on point sources, especially
the big industrial coal burning units; (3) measures include standards of emission concentrations at
the stacks, pollution fees, guidance of end-of-pipe treatment techniques and the corresponding 3S
requirements; and (4) if the law is violated, fines with the maximum capped at 500,000 RMB (exchange
rate: 1 USD = 8.28 RMB in 2000) shall be applied. Usually this is at most a small percentage of the
fixed investment. Though this basic system experienced a string of small changes, it saw no substantial
reform in the subsequent decades.
In terms of the regulatory effects, we focus on the two measures related with observable
physical outcomes, the 3S and pollution fees. The reality of implementation of the 3S was puzzling.
Its implementation rate increased from 87% in 1994 to 98% in 1999, whereas the ratio of investment in
3S over total fixed assets kept around 5‰. If both were true it would imply that new fixed investment
went to less polluting industries, which is not supported by the official statistics [58]:
Invest3s
Total invest =
Total investdirty×implementation rate o f 3S×β
Total investdirty+Total investclean
= implementation rate o f 3S×β
1+ Total investclean
Total investdirty
= 5‰
(1)
The pollution fee was a small levy on enterprises. Theoretically, its social efficient level equals
the marginal damage cost. However, in most industries pollution fee levels were much lower, even
lower than average abatement costs (e.g., in 2005 the pollution fee for SO2 was 0.63 yuan/kg, while
the average abatement costs of SO2 in coal fired power plants were between 4 to 6 yuan/kg [62]).
“Deal enforcement” [58] was in some cases the result, far from the original policy intention, with
enterprises actively paying the fee but not abating, and the EPBs actively collecting this fee to support
their own daily operations.
4.1.1. Some Fundamental Flaws
Looking back on what actually happened before 2005, air pollution, severe though, was not
regarded as an urgent social problem. The nature of the management regime was not so much a broad
air pollution prevention and control, as a limited project management on how enterprises do emission
discharge. It did have positive regulatory effects, but to a larger extent became a fetter on subsequent
policy adjustments. The limitations are clear:
1.
The general principles of environmental rights and interests are absent. It lacks the concept that
the atmospheric environmental capacity is natural capital, is scarce and has value. It does not
have an ultimate regulatory aim to protect human health and enhance social welfare.
2.
Inefficiencies are present.
Air pollutants transmit and transform but the management is
jurisdiction-based, therefore “leakage” and lack of regional coordination are predestined to
happen.
Campaign style regulations incur high administrative cost with transient effects.
Pollution fees are too low compared to the efficient level.
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2016, 13, 1219
11 of 22
3.
Monitoring capacity as a basic regulatory element is not created, therefore all policy instruments
designed based on the emission situation become ineffective. Estimated data with information
on inputs or experiences hardly reflect the real emission situation (see, e.g., [63]).
4.
Credibility of the law and regulations is seriously challenged. The cost of breaking environmental
laws is strikingly low [64]. Legal liability theoretically exists, but judicial latitude of discretion is huge
due to the too vague laws [48]. Campaign style regulations always come and go in haste. All this
preserves an expectation that they are and will be tacitly permitted to be incompletely implemented.
4.1.2. Special Case 1: Beijing Fought a Lone Battle
The Chinese central government is located in Beijing, where the air quality has long been
notoriously bad. Unlike that in other places, in Beijing air pollution control was a political task
with support from the central fiscal budget. As early as 1998, with direct instructions from the central
leadership, air pollution control in Beijing became the top priority in environment management in
China [65]. Leading the rest of China, Beijing adopted measures such as to substitute coal by clean
fuels in certain zones, to apply desulfurization, dust collection and low NOx combustion techniques in
power plants, to increase green land covering and control dusts from construction sites, and a series
of measures on vehicles including emission standards for new vehicles, high quality fuel supply,
detection of in-use vehicles and early retirement of heavy-duty and old vehicles [66]. However, due to
the surge in vehicles and the transported emissions from industrializing neighbors [67], the specific
efforts of Beijing were not enough to bring about any significant air quality improvement. These efforts
were not totally in vain, though, by providing important evidence; vehicle exhausts control, among
all the measures, was found to contribute the most to concentration abatement potential of NOx and
PM2.5 in Beijing [68].
4.2. 2006–2012, in the 11th Five-Year Plan and Early 12th Five-Year Plan
Based on what happened until 2005 many studies, as summarized in [63], predicted that without
fundamental institutional reform in China the “implementation gap” in environmental governance
could hardly be overcome. However, in the 11th FYP and early 12th FYP (2006–2012) China did
implement significant policies on air pollution, given an institutional arrangement largely unchanged.
The policies were the “total emission control on SO2” and the closely relevant “energy saving” policy.
For SO2 and chemical oxygen demand (COD, a measure of organic compounds in water) a 10%
reduction from the 2005 level was set as the national target. On energy saving, the target was
a 20% reduction of energy consumption per unit of GDP from the 2005 level. National targets were
decomposed among provinces, which led all the subordinate municipal governments to fulfill the
upper assigned target. In the 12th FYP (2011–2015) these policies were maintained and extended.
It should be noted that the national total control policies were initiated in the 9th FYP and further
specified in the 10th FYP but back then the implementation and results were failures (see, e.g., [10]).
In the 11th FYP, the implementation became remarkable and the targets were achieved. However the
air quality improvements were insignificant. Then three key questions arise: (1) Why did the local
governments implement the policies? (2) How did they implement the policies in different sectors and
industries? (3) Why the efforts are ineffective and inefficient in improving air quality? These three
questions are discussed in the following sections.
4.2.1. Why Did Local Governments Implement?
Various studies, as summarized in [69], seem to reach a consensus that one key element for
the successful implementation of total control policies was that each province’s target became
unprecedentedly “mandatory” and was linked to the veto track factors in cadre evaluation of local
main leaders. If the annual target were not met, then the local leaders were ordered to rectify within
a time limit. If the five years’ target failed, they would get a veto. This shift provided incentives for local
leaders to pay attention to these environmental targets. However, this could not ensure them to really
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2016, 13, 1219
12 of 22
do something if emission data could still be relatively easily adjusted. That was exactly what happened
in 2006 when total SO2 and COD emissions increased 1.9% and 2.4%, respectively, from 2005 levels.
Field evidence shows that local governments did manipulate emission data [63]. The centralization
of emission data management was another key element for local governments’ real implementation
starting from 2007, when another vertical string of environmental agencies with the main responsibility
of data management was established, with the key feature that data is now controlled and verified by
upper level agencies. Local EPBs only do data collection and report to regional supervision centers
whose administrative ranks are higher than those of the provincial governments. The regional centers
verify the reported abatement projects and audit the corresponding emission reduction data through
a “cumbersome” process. Field evidence shows that the details of the data examination and verification
were so sophisticated that the space for fabrication shrank significantly. Finally, the annual emission
reduction of a province was certificated by MEP and was used in cadre evaluation (details see, e.g., [63]).
This centralized data management guaranteed that the assessment of local implementation was based
on real efforts.
4.2.2. How Did Local Governments Implement Policies?
Among the many SO2 emitting sectors, the power sector reduced its emissions around three times
the net total SO2 reduction, by desulfurization of big plants and small plants phase-outs. The power
sector emits the most SO2 and the abatement capacity was huge with “low hanging fruits” [6]. It was
(and still is) composed of big and small units mostly belonging to five state owned enterprises (SOE)
whose leaders are another track of bureaucratic personnel and have similar promotion incentives
as local main leaders, therefore negotiations between the two are not that difficult. The big units
overall have limited heterogeneity and can be easily added the mature flue gas desulfurization (FGD)
technology. Empirical evidences, by looking at the behavioral changes of power plants [70,71] and
local governments [63,72], cross validated the implementation processes:
For desulfurization in big units, the FGD facilities were quickly installed whereas their normal
operation was later gradually realized along with the policy tightening. It was a price type instrument
that changed the incentive for many power plants. With a premium of 1.5 cent yuan/kWh to the feed-in
tariff for electricity generated from desulfurized units, it became slightly profitable to desulfurize.
To phase out small power plant units and some other outdated enterprises was a forced process,
involving local main leaders and the EPBs who coordinated among many relevant bureaus, e.g., the
industrial and commercial bureau to revoke licenses, utility stations to cut the power and water supply,
and the public security bureau to guarantee the enforcement (the enforcement was guaranteed by the
police force). In the 12th FYP, the targeted two emissions are SO2 plus NOX. SO2 is to be further abated.
For NOX, it is the power plant sector who again takes the leading role of “denitrifying”.
4.2.3. Why the Efforts Are Ineffective and Inefficient in Improving Air Quality?
Reducing the total emission of SO2, a single primary pollutant, does not necessarily improve air
quality. Elementary atmospheric chemistry shows that the transformation from primary pollutants
such as SO2, NOX and primary PM to secondary pollutants is complicated and is non-linear, as
described in earlier sections. Therefore, when a single type of primary pollutant emission is reduced,
air quality, as a comprehensive concept containing various primary and secondary pollutant levels,
might change, but not much.
We put the comprehensive air quality aside and focus on SO2 pollution abatement for the
moment. SO2 transmits within a regional scope. The jurisdictional based management cannot promote
inter-regional cooperation in abatement efforts (see, e.g., [7,73]). More developed places have higher
demand for SO2 pollution abatement but their more aggressive efforts are partially offset by the
transmitted amount from their less developed neighbors. Using SO2 inventory data from 2006 in
the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region [13], show that regional management could be more effective
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2016, 13, 1219
13 of 22
in terms of reduction in population inhaled SO2 (an indicator corresponding to health risk) than
jurisdictional management.
Cost saving potentials from the heterogeneity of abatement costs between territories and sectors
were not exploited. For example, marginal pollutant abatement costs ($/ton) differ significantly
in the cities and districts of the BTH region [15,74]. Even in the power sector with very similar
technologies, marginal abatement costs are considerably different. In other more heterogeneous sectors
such as industrial boilers, space for cost saving is even larger. Moreover, the effect from geographical
conditions influencing how pollutants transport and transform, the marginal concentration abatement
costs ($/µg·m−3) in these territories are also different. The administrative allocation of reduction
targets among territories does not allow for some flexible market mechanisms or collaborations to
jointly reduce the abatement costs.
4.2.4. Special Case 2: Beijing and Surrounding Territories Fought a United Battle
To improve Beijing’s air quality for the 2008 Olympic Games was a solemn promise and was
attained with a whole package of permanent and temporary actions. In Beijing, with all the regular
measures mentioned previously strictly implemented, more radical measures were gradually adopted
after 2005 (see, e.g., [75]). Regional transported pollution was taken into account and during the
Olympics multiple measures were implemented in surrounding territories including Tianjin, Hebei,
Shanxi and Inner Mongolia that can briefly be summarized as shutting down plants, restricting vehicle
use, performing onboard refueling vapor recovery in gas stations, strict control of construction site
dust and banning of straw burning [66]. To implement them everywhere was unrealistic, instead
scientific working groups (e.g., [66,76] identified key areas and screened and prioritized measures with
cost-effectiveness considerations.
The Beijing Olympics air quality management, as the very first one based on regional mechanism
in China, was remarkably effective. Air quality in Beijing improved significantly during and after the
Olympics, but most of the effect had faded away by the end of October 2009. Most improvements
were attributable to plant closures and traffic control (see, e.g., [75]) and such measures have also been
used and proved effective during the 2010 World Exposition in Shanghai, the 2010 Asian Games in
Guangzhou, the 2014 APEC Conference in Beijing, and the 2015 Military Parade in Beijing. These efforts
became the predecessor of the current regional management mechanism initiated in the BTH region,
Pearl River Delta (PRD) and Yangtze River Delta (YRD).
4.3. From 2013: PM2.5 Crisis and then “Declaration of War against Pollution”
During January and February in 2013 severe haze covered many provinces and cities in China.
The haze with its unprecedentedly high index of PM2.5 concentration and extremely low visibility was
of worldwide concern and eventually became known as the “PM2.5 crisis”. Rather than an overnight
shift, some preludes included: discrepancies between the monitoring data from U.S. Embassy in
Beijing and Beijing EPB’s descriptive air pollution index were noticed and questioned [77], the health
impacts of PM2.5 came to light, and the rapidly expanding power of social media in evolving the haze
into a social crisis [78].
Quickly responding to the crisis, the State Council and MEP issued “Ten Actions” in June 2013 and
later in September the well-known Action Plan (Table 2). Premier Li Keqiang declared in September
2013 that China is not willing to and shall not “pollute first and clean up later”, instead shall treat
pollution with “iron fists” [79]. Subsequently the “iron fists” was unexceptionally used in official
media and local government documents. The strong political will was further solidified in the 2014
government work report, “China shall punch hard to strengthen the prevention and control of pollution,
and resolutely declare war against pollution” [80].

1 In this table we adopted the translation from Chinese by the Clean Air Alliance of China (CAAC). A full
English version is available at http://sustainabletransport.org/china-releases-national-action-plan-on-air-
pollution-control/.
The Action Plan for the first time sets quantitative air quality improvement goals for key regions
within a clear time limit and lists ten key actions covering all the major aspects of air quality
management (Table 2). From this Action Plan various policies have emerged. Here we classify
the policies into major series and outline some of the recent direct policy outcomes.
1.
The “total control” of SO2 and NOX is strengthened and accelerated: The conventional methods
have been fully implemented, such as desulfurization, denitrification and dust precipitation of
power plants and big industry boilers, closing small ones and phase-out of outdated industrial
capacity. As vehicles are important contributors to NOx, the early retirement of old vehicles is
also emphasized. The 12th FYP is coming to an end and its total emission control goals for major
pollutants have already being achieved in advance or are about to be reached.
2.
The new target responsibility agreements under the Action Plan scheme: MEP coordinated the
signing of provincial action plans between central and provincial governments. Provincial action
plans have similar structure compared to the nation one, including firstly the provincial air
quality improvement goals and then a list of measures. These goals are not explicitly linked to
veto track indicators of cadre evaluation yet, but a weighted grading system has been issued with
the highest weight given to air quality goals. Serious accountability is reflected by some recent
reported “arranged talks” between MEP and local leaders whose jurisdiction performed poorly
in this grading system [81].
3.
Unify standards, build up supporting monitoring networks and perform source apportionment
analysis: A common feature of these efforts is that unification within regional scope is emphasized.
Many standards are being updated, including air quality and heave pollution alerting index
systems, emission standards of power plants, boilers and vehicles, fuel quality standards,
technical specifications of emission monitoring and accounting. Air quality monitoring regional
networks are being built. Key regions and major cities are required to establish their source
inventory and perform source apportionment analysis to support further policy processes.
Among the cities that have finished the analysis, results are similar with different shares among
the main sources in different sectors [82].
4.
Regional cooperation mechanism is taking substantial steps: Based on previous experiences, in
the BTH, YRD and PRD regions, special working panels coordinate joint meetings and draft
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2016, 13, 1219
15 of 22
regional plans and key tasks. Taking the BTH region as an example, specific cooperation tasks
being proposed and prepared include “joint emergency handling mechanism for serious pollution
weather”, “couplet assistance” between Beijing, Tianjin and less developed cities in Hebei
Province, “joint monitoring and enforcement” of regional pollution issues such as straw burning,
fuel quality and vehicle exhausts [83].
5.
Cap for coal consumption: To set a cap on annual coal consumption of 3000 Million Tons of Coal
Equivalent (Mtce) by 2020 was chosen as a core strategy to address the ambient air pollution in
China. The BTH, YRD and PRD regions are required to cap coal consumption by 2017. Similar to
total emission control, annual coal reduction goals are subcontracted to provincial and municipal
governments. “Coal to gas” in power plants was first implemented in Beijing and quickly adopted
by other places. However, currently (besides Beijing) most of them have suspended or canceled
the initiative, mainly because natural gas is still scarce and costly in China. Evidence show
that “coal to gas” in power plants in Beijing is likely to be a net social economic loss in the
current specific situation [16]. Other treatments on coal such as to reallocate high-quality coal and
“ultra-low-emission technology” are initiated but without shared conclusion of their efficiency.
The relative cost-effectiveness of first allocating high-quality coal to power plants instead of
industrial boilers, as being implemented in some places, is also challenged [84].
6.
Revising law and enhancing enforcement: A dozen of “serious cases of environmental damage”
subject to criminal penalties are made explicit [85]. In 2014 more than 8000 suspects were arrested
in more than 2000 environmental criminal actions, an amount which is twice the number of
cases in all the previous 10 years [86]. The Environment Protection Law was amended in 2014.
From the legal liability perspective, fines on illegal discharge are now imposed consecutively on
a daily basis without a cap. In the first half year of 2015 after the new law coming into force, cases
found applicable to several new penalty measures have been doubling and tripling on a monthly
base [81]. Other specific laws on air, water and soil are under revision but the process is not as
smooth as the revision of the basic law.
7.
Public participation and civil society’s role is increasing: Litigation qualification for non-governmental
actors is defined in the new law. Around 300 environmental “social organizations” are qualified
to file litigation to the people’s courts. Information disclosure started from public available
real-time air quality monitoring data, and now expands to pollution source related data such
as records of enterprises’ penalties. In some provinces, the EPBs are reported as mobilizing in
a campaign style to innovatively disclosure information and promote public participation in
supervision and reporting of environment related illegal practices.
8.
Price and quantity type market instruments are being simultaneously designed in full swing:
For pollutants, pollution fees are to be changed into pollution taxes as reflected in the Environmental
Protection Tax Law (draft for soliciting opinions, released in June 2015). Tradable pollutant
permits are implemented in pilot provinces and cities.
Primary markets are established,
whereas transactions of permits in secondary markets are not frequent [87]. Carbon taxes and
tradable permits, though not directly targeting air pollution, obviously are relevant. There are
different tendencies between governmental departments. The National Development and Reform
Commission (NDRC) has been leading the preparation of tradable carbon permits. The Ministry
of Finance has been involved in designing a carbon tax. Theoretical research does not provide
a clear cut conclusion on the choice of price and quantity type instrument, nor on the possibility to
realize first best abatement levels when the two types coexist. Rather it is a case by case situation
where different emissions coexist and abatement costs differ (see, e.g., [88]). Therefore, more
empirical research is needed in the current Chinese context. Knowledge beyond economics is
also important. For example, the current local tax collecting system in China may be used for
collecting carbon and environmental taxes [89], whereas a tradable permits system requires new
administrative departments to be set up.

5. Discussion
5.1. The Driving Factors of Policy Changes
Until now we have seen three major changes of air pollution control policies with significant
implementation involving: (1) the transition in implementation of total emission control on SO2; (2) the
temporary but effective regional air quality management at the 2008 Olympics and repeated several
times later, which leads the current efforts for development of regional air quality management;
and (3) the latest policy waves triggered by a PM2.5 crisis.
These changes do not necessarily
suggest that China is undergoing fundamental reform on her own initiative. Rather they, as good
examples, reflect some everlasting features of Chinese governance logic. The external force driving
the changes, especially the latest wave, probably can only be attributed to the profound changes in
social development. Literature looking at the institutional logic of governance and the reasons for
the repeated and circle governance phenomena from history to present in China has made important
progress (see, e.g., [45]). We do not go deep into this line of literature but borrow some of their shared
conclusions to try to explain the three policy changes.
The transition in implementation of total emission control on SO2 is an example of decentralization
and recentralization of power, which is one theme of dynamics in the principal-agent relationship
between central and local government in China. From the very beginning, air quality management,
which should have been seen as a public good provision, was decentralized and administrative
subcontracted together with other economic development tasks. Implementation was bound to fail
due to the intrinsic problems in the principal-agent relationships. As an internal modification, with
the system largely unchanged, the power to manage and verify the data was partially recentralized to
the principal central government by the new data management system and then implementation was
guaranteed, though full of distortions and inefficiencies.
The effective while short-lived regional air quality management during the mega events is
a perfect example of “campaign style” regulation. In China, campaign style regulation exists almost
universally from central to local levels, from history to the present. Setting aside its “legitimacy”,
or pros and cons, it is an important supplement to China’s regular governance system [57]. When there
is a special situation of need, campaign style regulations can be very effective by quickly mobilizing
all kinds of capacities and if necessary, suspending all the regular activities to make sure that all the
attention and resource are gathered to fulfill certain short-term goals. The temporary changes in air
quality management in mega events are such a process.
Triggered by the PM2.5 crisis, the third ongoing change in air pollution control policies did
start with obvious campaign style characteristics, such as intensive signal release of strong political
will, immediate implementation of all the Olympics temporary measures in Beijing and among its
neighbors [90]. However, after two years since the crisis, all kinds of new policies are still emerging
and air quality management is likely to experience major changes. From what have happened it
seems that this time it will not stop as a campaign style process. This reflects the fact that the space
of “informal” governance has been shrinking and the governance is adapting itself to the changes in
society. Irreversible trends such as information technology, increase in social mobility, and awareness of
civil rights and public participation make it more and more difficult and costly to regulate in a flexible
way such as to declare that “all is well” or perform “informal” measures. Governance is pushed
forward to be more standardized, normalized, and legalized.
5.2. Macro Trends That Have Taken Shape
Changes in air quality management in China are the “tip of the iceberg” of an ongoing profound
regime shift, including reforms of environmental management and social economic development
patterns. Based on what is going on, some macro level trends are taking shape:
1.
Strongest ever and lasting political will: Perhaps the most explicit change in air pollution control
is that it has become one of the top priorities in all the efforts belonging to the construction of
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2016, 13, 1219
17 of 22
“Ecological Civilization”, and will probably stay so. Regardless of the naming, this state ideology
is an “extremely important and urgent mission” as recently reconfirmed by the central power.
A red line on environmental quality is also set by the central leadership, that air, water and soil
quality in China shall only get better, not deteriorate [91]. The strong political will and red lines
form the foundation of the ongoing changes.
2.
Public participation and the civil society’s role are increasing: “Environment in China has severely
deteriorated” has already become an irreversible public consensus. Along with the income increase
and living standard improvement, individuals demand better environment quality. Environment
right-defending actions, after a dozen of years of small scale but unremitting pursuit, have obtained
breakthroughs recently. Environmental litigation qualification for non-governmental actors is
guaranteed in the new law and this also enhances public expectations on claiming environmental
rights. Governments’ attitude also changes. Local EPBs are becoming willing to disclose more
information in order to promote public participation in helping enforcement.
3.
Continuously increasing demand for “quantification”: Regular scientific quantification capacities
such as monitoring, atmospheric modeling, source apportionment, health risk assessments have
long been learned and developed by Chinese researchers while previously in most cases they
were not utilized outside academia, except during the several mega events. Now there is an
increasing demand to build up united quantification capacities and publicly available information
platforms. Only with these can policy instruments such as performance standards, permits, taxes,
damage liabilities, etc., become possible. This is to some extent the infrastructure for most of
future policy designs.
4.
“Top Design” (Ding Ceng She Ji) strategy integrating environment, climate, energy and regional
development: Air pollution control is used as the breakthrough point of environmental protection
reform, which in turn is used by the central power as a leading factor to reshape the economy and
social development. The intention to integrate environment, energy and regional development
issues under the climate context is well documented in the recently submitted China Intended
Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC). For China’s self-interest [92,93], immediate actions
such as cap on coal are being taken to ensure the achievement of the quantitative climate promises.
6. Conclusions
In this review we provide a comprehensive review of the Chinese air pollution situation and its
related policies from the 1980s to the latest developments. We combine scientific and institutional
backgrounds to provide the basis for understanding the decades’ air pollution control policy dynamics.
We categorize these policies into three stages, and analyses the trends and driving factors of different
policy changes. With China’s significant role in air pollution and related environment, energy and
climate issues, more and more people are in need of deep and up-to-date understanding of China’s
relevant policies. Thus we contribute by forming a common knowledge platform for future dialog
among natural scientists, economists, political scientists and policy makers on this increasingly
important topic.
We summarized the macro level trends of policy changes in Section 5.2. At the same time,
many practical challenges emerge when descending to specific regulatory management designs and
implementation. A typical example is the big controversy surrounding the revision of the Law on the
Prevention and Control of Atmospheric Pollution (the revision was finished on the 29 August 2015,
and the new law comes into force from 2016). This revision is originally aimed as an effort to solidify
a new air quality management scheme in the form of a law. Given the many fundamental flaws of the
largely inherited basic system and the ineffectiveness of total control policies, we end this review with
an open-ended conclusion: to repair or to rebuild?
Based on the experiences of the total control policies, people learned that implementation and
enforcement of environmental regulation can be well guaranteed by the cadre evaluation system
and the centralized data management system. The legislation committee has the intention to solidify
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2016, 13, 1219
18 of 22
these total control measures into the new law, whereas most experts in environmental management,
environmental economics, and environmental law in China disagree with the new law draft and
propose the elimination of the total control measures. Total control is just one abatement measure and
is not a quality based design. The 11th FYP experience has proved that insuring the implementation of
measures does not necessarily bring air quality improvements. Experts argue to totally rebuild the law.
Most of the shared experts’ ideas are summarized in [94]. First and foremost, an ultimate subject
should penetrate throughout the law rather than only being mentioned in the beginning, which is
to protect air quality and public health. Then all the legislation and relevant indicators in cadre
evaluation and liability should center on the quality based themes and goals. Some recent important
experiences should also be more explicitly specified, not only be required or advocated, such as
regional cooperation mechanisms, to unify and make standards consistent, the disclosure of quality
based information and the possibility to make environmental civil rights claim based on this quality
information. Experts’ ideas are not novel compared to international practice and are to some extent
self-evident from the basic environmental economics and law perspective. The reason why it is still
a hard choice for China to decide whether to keep walking on the total control track or to change paths
is that the latter means to abandon, or at least major reform, the existing total control data accounting
and verification mechanism, which already involved huge investments and personnel, and which the
MEP and local governments are already familiar with.
Though it may not be realized in the near future, we have good reason to predict a revolutionary
change. Accompanied by the irreversible changes in social development, the public good nature of
air quality, or more generally environment quality, makes it destined to go from the original measure
oriented departmental governance to public governance. The ultimate goal is supposed to be to enhance
social welfare by protecting human health through improving air quality. Therefore, air quality based
and health risk based management scheme is the general direction. For now, as always, the final format
of the revised law might not be fundamentally critical since environmental governance in China is and
probably will be a planning dominated process [6]. For the future, the world will be watching.
