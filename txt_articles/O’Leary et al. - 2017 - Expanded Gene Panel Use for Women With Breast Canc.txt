ABSTRACT
Background. Clinicians ordering multi-gene next-gener-
ation sequencing panels for hereditary breast cancer risk
have a variety of test panel options. Many panels include
lesser known breast cancer genes or genes associated with
other cancers. The authors hypothesized that using broader
gene panels increases the identification of clinically sig-
nificant findings, some relevant and others incidental to the
testing indication. They examined clinician ordering pat-
terns and compared the yield of pathogenic or likely
pathogenic (P/LP) variants in non-BRCA genes of female
breast cancer patients.
Methods. This study analyzed de-identified personal and
family histories in 1085 breast cancer cases with P/LP
multi-gene panel findings in non-BRCA cancer genes and
sorted them into three groups by the panel used for testing:
group A (breast cancer genes only), group B (commonly
assessed cancers: breast, gynecologic, and gastrointestinal),
and group C (a more expanded set of tumors). The fre-
quency
of
P/LP
variants
in
genes
with
established
management guidelines was compared and evaluated for
consistency with personal and family histories.
Results. This study identified 1131 P/LP variants and
compared variants in clinically actionable genes for breast
and non-breast cancers. Overall, 91.5% of these variants
were in genes with management guidelines. Nearly 12%
were unrelated to personal or family history.
Conclusion. Broader panels were used for 85.6% of our
cohort (groups B and C). Although pathogenic variants in
non-BRCA genes are reportedly rare, the study found that
most were in clinically actionable genes. Expanded panel
testing improved the identification of hereditary cancer risk.
Small, breast-limited panels may miss clinically relevant
findings in genes associated with other heritable cancers.
Breast cancer is a multifactorial disease caused by a
combination of environmental and genetic factors.1 In an
estimated 10% of breast cancers, the genetic factor is
contributed primarily by mutations in a single gene.2
Testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) has been
available for more than two decades, and multiple profes-
sional organizations have developed guidelines for testing
individuals
based
on
suggestive
personal
or
family
history.3–7
The clinical impact and cancer risks for individuals with
pathogenic variants in BRCA1/2 are well studied.8 Like-
wise,
medical
management
guidelines
have
been
established and are frequently updated.3–5 These guidelines
also address high- and moderate-risk genes such as TP53
and PTEN.3,9,10 Although medical management guidelines
exist for many other genes such as PALB2, CHEK2, and
ATM, no defined testing criteria have been established.
The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has
allowed for the efficient, cost-effective analysis of many
genes simultaneously.11–13 Multiple studies have demon-
strated
that
compared
with
multi-gene NGS panels,
traditional testing of BRCA1/2 alone misses potentially
actionable findings in a substantial proportion of cases.14–18

 but they do not explicitly advocate for or against the use
this testing method.3,5 Identified benefits include the
increased yield of positive findings, whereas limitations
may include higher rates for variants of unknown signifi-
cance and findings with no established management
guidelines.3,5 In the absence of guidelines for choosing
appropriately from
the increasing variety of
panels,
oncology providers must determine whether to select high-
risk panels limited to genes with established medical
management guidelines or larger panels that have dozens
of genes associated with a variety of non-breast hereditary
cancers.
Using a consecutive series of 20,592 women with breast
cancer undergoing hereditary genetic testing in our com-
mercial laboratory, we sought to clarify the current use of
larger hereditary cancer panels and determine their clinical
impact. We analyzed a large cohort of breast cancer
patients identified as having one or more pathogenic or
likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants in genes other than
BRCA1/2. Clinician ordering patterns were reviewed, and
their impact on the rate of P/LP findings was described.
Personal and family history information was reviewed to
determine how often genetic test results were consistent
with the indications for testing and to define the utility of
hereditary gene panels for identifying clinically actionable
findings. We hypothesized that using broader gene panels
increases the identification of clinically significant findings,
some
relevant
and
others
incidental
to
the
testing
indication.
METHODS
The study cohort consisted of all patients referred to our
commercial laboratory between February 2015 and August
2016 for diagnostic multi-gene panel testing for hereditary
breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC). Patients referred to
undergo family variant testing for a known pathogenic
mutation were excluded.
The gene panels analyzed for each patient were chosen
at the discretion of the ordering provider and ranged from 2
to 79 genes. The price of a panel was the same regardless
of the number of genes, making test selection dependent
only on patient and provider preferences. Testing was
performed with NGS, as previously described,18 and vari-
ant interpretation was carried out based on an expansion of
the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics
(ACMG) guidelines.19
A total of 2105 individuals with P/LP variants were
identified. Of these individuals, 1020 had P/LP variants in
BRCA1 or BRCA2 and were excluded, leaving 1085 indi-
viduals with P/LP findings in other genes associated with
increased risk of
heritable
cancer
(Fig. 1). Notably,
common and low-penetrance variants (e.g., APC I1370 K,
CHEK2 I157T) were included for analysis.
According to an institutional review board (IRB)-ap-
proved study protocol, de-identified personal and family
history information from submitted requisition forms and
medical records (when available) for each case were
reviewed and compared with published testing guidelines3
to determine whether the findings were consistent with the
reported history information (expected findings) or not
(incidental findings). All variants were analyzed to deter-
mine the frequency of findings in genes with published
medical
management
guidelines,4,5
including
current
ASBS guidelines, NCCN guidelines for HBOC and
hereditary colorectal cancer, and other published profes-
sional
guidelines
(see
Appendix
1
in
Electronic
Supplementary Material).
The case series was divided into three primary order
groups according to the type of panel ordered:
•
Group A: panels consisting of genes associated pri-
marily with breast cancer (ATM, BARD1, BRCA1,
BRCA2, BRIP1, CDH1, CHEK2, FANCC, MRE11A,
NBN, NF1, PALB2, PTEN, STK11, TP53), most of
which have established clinical management guide-
lines. Orders in this category included up to 15 genes.
•
Group B: panels containing all the genes in group A
plus genes associated with other commonly assessed
cancer types (i.e., breast, gynecologic, and gastroin-
testinal) (APC, AXIN2, BMPR1A, CDKN2A, DICER1,
EPCAM, GREM1, KIT, MEN1, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6,
MUTYH, PDGFRA, PMS2, POLD1, POLE, RAD51C,
RAD51D, SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, SMAD4,
SMARCA4, TSC1, TSC2, VHL). Orders in this category
included up to 42 genes.
•
Group C: large, comprehensive panels including all the
genes in groups A and B plus an expanded list of genes
for other tumor types (i.e., prostate, sarcoma, brain).
Orders in this category included up to 79 genes.
RESULTS
Among the 1085 cases reviewed, 1131 P/LP variants
were identified, with 44 patients (4%) having two or more
P/LP variants. Overall, 91.5% of the variants identified in
this cohort were in genes with medical management
guidelines (Fig. 2).
As shown in Fig. 3, the majority of cases (72.6%) were
in ordering group B. As expected, a greater proportion of
P/LP variants in genes with breast management guidelines
was in group A (97.5%) than in groups B (63.6%) and C
(50%). In groups B and C, a significant percentage of P/LP
variants (28.5 and 31.8%, respectively) were identified in

 genes associated with increased risk of non-breast cancers
for which established management guidelines exist (see
Appendix 1 in Electronic Supplementary Material).
Perhaps surprisingly, 132 P/LP variants (11.7%) were
unexpected clinically actionable findings (i.e., variants in
genes for which patients had no suggestive personal or
familial history and for which medical management
guidelines exist). By panel, approximately 13 and 15% of
the P/LP variants identified in groups B and C, respec-
tively, consisted of these unexpected findings (Table 1).
Overall, the most common P/LP findings in BRCA1/2-
negative patients were in CHEK2 (27.6%), MUTYH (15%),
ATM (14.9%), and PALB2 (12.2%) (Fig. 4).
We also determined the number of patients with one or
more variants of uncertain significance (VUS), excluding
those with both VUS and P/LP variants. As expected, VUS
rates were directly proportional to the number of genes
analyzed. One VUS or more were found in 12.7% of the
patients in group A, 31.6% of the patients in group B, and
49.6% of the patients in group C.
DISCUSSION
Clinicians face a multitude of options when ordering
hereditary genetic testing for breast cancer risk, including
single-gene tests such as those limited to BRCA1/2, multi-
gene panels including genes associated with a high risk of
breast cancer, panels for genes associated with multiple
common cancer types (e.g., breast, gynecologic, and gas-
trointestinal), and comprehensive panels including genes

 associated with both common (e.g., prostate) and rare (e.g.,
sarcoma) cancers. Professional societies have published
testing recommendations limited to specific genes such as
BRCA1/2 and those associated with well-described hered-
itary cancer conditions such as Li-Fraumeni (TP53) and
Cowden syndrome (PTEN).3,5
The results of this report and others, however, suggest a
trend toward ordering larger panels,20–22 which have the
advantage of increased yield afforded by querying more
genes. A recent study examining the yield of 348 multi-
gene tests not limited to breast cancer found that the
inclusion of moderate-risk genes increased only the posi-
tive
rate
of
‘‘historically
high-risk’’
cancer
genes.26
Another study, which assessed 90 HBOC patients, found
that the positive rate roughly doubled when the panel
included genes beyond BRCA1/2.27 Among clinic-based
studies of BRCA1/2-negative patients, the prevalence of
pathogenic variants in non-BRCA genes ranged from 3.7 to
16%.14–17,28–31
Our data support previous studies showing that expan-
ded panel testing improves the identification of hereditary
cancer risk for patients and their family members. We
found that the use of expanded panels increased the number
of clinically relevant results, many of which were not
associated with personal or family history. In group A, the
genes tested were limited to those associated with breast
cancer, and therefore, all the variants identified were
related to clinical or family history. In group B, however,
patients were tested for genes associated with common
cancer types (including breast, gynecologic, and gastroin-
testinal), and 13% of the P/LP variants were identified in
genes that had published medical management recom-
mendations but were not associated with the personal or
family history. This number increased to 15% in group C,
which represented the most comprehensive panels (Table 1).
This proportion of unexpected findings is higher than
previous estimates (8% in a cohort of 1046 BRCA1/2-
negative individuals evaluated for HBOC).32
Our findings are consistent with prior studies suggesting
that expanded panels increase diagnostic yield and fur-
thermore showed that the vast majority of variants
identified (92%) were associated with medical manage-
ment guidelines that may alter clinical care. Additionally,
our results suggest that breast cancer-specific panels may
miss clinically actionable findings in genes associated with
hereditary predispositions for other cancers.
Another important finding was that a considerable
number of patients had more than one pathogenic variant.
Of 44 patients with two or more clinically significant
variants, 26 (59%) would not have been identified with a
panel specific to breast cancer.
The findings showed P/LP variants in a variety of genes
(Fig. 4), but most commonly in CHEK2, which accounted
for 27.6% of our positive findings. This gene is associated

 with an increased risk for autosomal dominant adult-onset
cancers including breast, colon, thyroid, and prostate can-
cers,
and
possibly
others.33–37
These
cancer
risks,
particularly the risks for breast cancer, depend on the
variant and family history.34,38 Several studies have found
that pathogenic variants in CHEK2 are observed at a fre-
quency higher than those of variants identified in other
breast cancer-associated genes on multi-gene panels,22,26,39
which is consistent with our observations. One case
example from our cohort was a woman who received a
diagnosis of breast cancer at age 37. Her family history was
significant for breast cancer in her mother (diagnosed when
she was 47 years old) and maternal aunt (diagnosed when
she was 49 years old). Although the patient had previous
negative BRCA1/2 testing, her clinician ordered a larger
breast cancer panel based on her age at diagnosis and
striking family history. The results showed a pathogenic
variant in CHEK2.
Professional management guidelines include considera-
tion of bilateral mastectomy or screening with breast
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and colonoscopy,
beginning at the age of 40 years.3,5 The use of BRCA1/2
testing alone failed to provide an explanation for the breast
cancers in this family. Expanded multi-gene testing showed
clinically actionable results that not only explained the
family history but also had implications for family
members.
In this study, MUTYH heterozygotes accounted for 15%
of our P/LP findings, likely due to the relatively high
MUTYH carrier frequency among whites of Northern
European descent. Approximately 1.5–2% of the individuals
in this population carry one of two well-described founder
variants:
c.536A
[
G
(p.Tyr179Cys)
in
exon
7
and
c.1187G
[
A (p.Gly396Asp).40–42 It is known that MUTYH
heterozygotes have an increased risk for colorectal cancer,
and medical management and surveillance protocols have
been developed.4 Colonoscopy every 5 years is recom-
mended beginning at age 40 or 10 years earlier than the
youngest age at diagnosis in an affected first-degree relative.
An example from our cohort was a 40-year-old woman with
a diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma and no family
history of cancer. A 26-gene breast cancer panel identified a
single pathogenic MUTYH variant. Although this result may
not explain her early onset breast cancer diagnosis, it
showed an increased risk for colon cancer, thereby allowing
the implementation of screening guidelines.
The criticisms of multi-gene panels are well known. One
criticism focuses on the increased risk of obtaining
uncertain results lacking clear management guidelines,
such as variants in genes with undefined cancer risks or
P/LP variants in genes that lack established screening
guidelines.23 Another concern is the risk of overestimating
the clinical implications of a P/LP result in a low- to
moderate-risk gene.24 A further criticism is the propor-
tionate increase in the number of VUS
for which
management is unclear. Finally, multi-gene panels can
require more extensive pre-test genetic counseling.22
Despite these limitations, the decreasing cost of genetic
testing due to NGS technology has made multi-gene panels
accessible to clinicians and patients. In this study, the price
of ordering a genetic test was the same regardless of the
number of genes on the panel, making test selection
dependent only on patient and provider preferences. The
majority (85.6%) of our cohort of 1085 patients were tested
with broader panels that assessed risks for multiple cancer
types (groups B and C). This result is consistent with the
reported trend of providers ordering testing of more genes
per patient.25
This study had a number of limitations. Although pub-
lished management guidelines exist for the majority of
positive variants identified, the utility of discovering these
variants for post-test management was assumed but not
assessed. Further analysis of patient outcomes is needed to
clarify the actual clinical impact of panel testing. Because
panel selection was at the discretion of the ordering pro-
vider, the genes analyzed varied by patient. This may have
been influenced in part by the tendency of clinicians to
order a large panel for patients with complicated clinical
presentations. However, this was not assessed in our study.
In addition, personal and family history information was
limited to that on the test request form. Any relevant family
history or secondary diagnosis was not analyzed. Finally,
we were unable to assess ordering patterns by clinician
type (genetic counselor, surgeons, oncologists, OB/gyn).
CONCLUSION
Expanded panel testing increased the identification of
P/LP findings related to non-breast cancers. Notably, most
of these findings occurred in clinically actionable genes
with published management recommendations.
The potential downsides of comprehensive panel testing
must be weighed against the opportunity to discover
actionable variants that may lead to earlier screening and
detection, prevention, and decreased cancer morbidity.
Pretest counseling should address the potential for inci-
dental but actionable findings and findings that have no
medical management guidelines. Finally, further analysis is
needed to determine the clinical impact and patient out-
comes associated with the identification of P/LP variants in
non-BRCA1/2 genes.
