Toll-like receptors: the swiss army knife of immunity
and vaccine development
Jennifer K Dowling1,2 and Ashley Mansell1,2
Innate immune cells have a critical role in defense against infection and disease. Central to this is the broad specificity with
which they can detect pathogen-associated patterns and danger-associated patterns via the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs)
they express. Several families of PRRs have been identified including: Toll-like receptors (TLRs), C-type lectin-like receptors,
retinoic acid-inducible gene-like receptors and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain–like receptors. TLRs are one of the
most largely studied families of PRRs. The binding of ligands to TLRs on antigen presenting cells (APCs), mainly dendritic cells,
leads to APC maturation, induction of inflammatory cytokines and the priming of naive T cells to drive acquired immunity.
Therefore, activation of TLRs promotes both innate inflammatory responses and the induction of adaptive immunity.
Consequently, in the last two decades mounting evidence has inextricably linked TLR activation with the pathogenesis of
immune diseases and cancer. It has become advantageous to harness these aspects of TLR signaling therapeutically to
accelerate and enhance the induction of vaccine-specific responses and also target TLRs with the use of biologics and small
molecule inhibitors for the treatment of disease. In these respects, TLRs may be considered a ‘Swiss Army’ knife of the immune
system, ready to respond in a multitude of infectious and disease states. Here we describe the latest advances in TLR-targeted
therapeutics and the use of TLR ligands as vaccine adjuvants.

TOLL-LIKE RECEPTORS AND SIGNALING
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are type I transmembrane proteins.1
10 human TLRs have been classified (TLR1–TLR10) and 12 in mouse
(TLR1–9, TLR11–13).2 They form a part of the Toll/interleukin-1
(TIR) superfamily that includes the interleukin-1 receptors (IL-1Rs)
because of the shared homology of their cytoplasmic domains.
However, the extracellular domain of IL-1Rs consist of an immuno-
globulin G (IgG) domain, while TLR extracellular domains are made
up of tandem repeats of leucine-rich regions termed leucine-rich
repeats. The arrangement of leucine-rich repeats confers a unique
combinatorial code to each TLR allowing it to bind a specific ligand.
They are expressed by a variety of cell types and are distinguished by
their ligand specificity, signal transduction and cellular localization.3
TLRs are localized to either the cell surface (TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5
and TLR6) or intracellular compartments (TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and
TLR9). The location of any given TLR is related to the origin of the
ligand it recognizes. TLRs on the cell surface are largely involved in the
detection of bacterial products in the extracellular space, while
endosomal TLRs detect nucleic acids of viral and bacterial origin. In
addition, localization is also important for the discrimination between
‘self’ and ‘non-self’. In contrast to most TLR ligands, nucleic acids can
be of self and foreign origin. Studies have demonstrated that a
chimeric TLR9 consisting of a transmembrane and cytoplasmic
domain of TLR4 localizes to the plasma membrane.4 Here it is able
to detect and respond to mammalian DNA, yet remain unresponsive
to viral nucleic acids. Endogenous TLR9 is not exposed to mammalian
DNA and can only be activated by viral DNA ingested and acidified
within endosomes.
The
recognition
of
pathogen-associated
patterns
or
danger-
associated patterns by TLRs results in the activation of signaling
pathways that induce the upregulation of cytokines, chemokines and
costimulatory molecules. Specifically, binding of ligand initiates the
dimerization of two TLR receptor chains and conformational changes
that allow the recruitment of TIR domain adaptor molecules to the
cytoplasmic TIR domains of TLRs. Differential recruitment of specific
adaptor proteins MyD88, MyD88 adaptor like (Mal, also known as
TIR domain-containing adaptor protein, TIRAP),5 TIR-domain con-
taining adaptor-inducing interferon-β (TRIF) or TRIF-related adaptor
molecule drives subsequent signaling.6 This results in the activation of
a number of downstream pathways, including nuclear factor kappa B
(NF-κB), interferon regulatory factor (IRF) and mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) pathways to induce type I interferons (IFNs),
chemokines and cytokines.
The binding of ligand to a TLR receptor complex and subsequent
recruitment of adaptors to active TIR domains of TLRs leads to
the activation of two major signaling cascades, namely the MyD88-

 dependant and MyD88-independent pathways (also referred to as the
TRIF-dependant pathway).7 The MyD88-dependent pathway results in
nuclear translocation of NF-κB and induction of pro-inflammatory
cytokines (for example, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα)),
while the MyD88-independent pathway mediates induction of the
anti-viral type I IFNs (for example, IFNα/β/γ) and IFN-inducible
genes via IRFs (for example, IRF3/7). Therefore, the MyD88-
dependant pathway is involved in inflammatory responses and the
MyD88-independent pathway is predominantly responsible for anti-
viral responses. All TLRs with the exception of TLR3 are known to
recruit MyD88 and activate the MyD88-dependent pathway activating
MAPKs and NF-κB.7 TLR3 typically activates IRFs and the expression
of IFNs from endocytic compartments via TRIF. Signaling via TLR4 is
unique
in
that
it
activates
both
the
MyD88-dependant
and
–independent pathways. TLR4 utilizes MyD88 and Mal to activate
NF-κB and yet can also activate IRFs via recruitment of TRIF-related
adaptor molecule and TRIF (Figure 1). In addition to MyD88, TLR2
and TLR4 require Mal to activate the MyD88-dependant pathway.5,8
MyD88 is essential for type 1 IFN production through the endosomal
TLRs, TLR7 and TLR9.9 However, recent studies have highlighted a
role for Mal in signaling via TLR7 and TLR9,10 although the
mechanism of this signaling is not well understood.
Understanding the recognition and interaction of ligands by TLRs
and their subsequent activation is important for designing therapeutic
compounds that can target TLRs during inflammatory disease. Most
ligands are by nature complex whether they are components from
bacteria, viruses, fungi or the host. The potency of a ligand relies on its
ability to induce homo- or hetero-dimerization and/or conformational
change of receptor chains. Direct binding of several TLRs to their
known ligands has been experimentally demonstrated including:
TLR9,11
TLR1/2,12
TLR413
and
TLR3,14
TLR5,15
TLR816
and
TLR13.17 This work and the description of crystallographic structures
of the extracellular domains of the TLR1/2 heterodimer,12 TLR318 and
TLR4–MD213 in complex with ligands has enhanced the potential to
identify novel small molecule inhibitors of TLRs and design better
therapeutics.
VACCINES AND ADJUVANTS: TLRS LEND A HELPING HAND
Vaccination is a powerful tool for preventing infectious disease, allergy
and cancer. The eradication of smallpox and the reduction of polio
and measles are among the vaccination success stories. However, the
development of improved vaccines is of great importance with the
continued emergence of pathogenic viral strains (that is, influenza and
HIV) and the existence of terminal cancers. Conventionally, vaccines
were produced from either live attenuated or heat-inactivated
organisms. In recent years, advances in molecular biology and our
understanding of immune responses has made the development of
‘next generation’ vaccines possible. Next-generation vaccines or
subunit vaccines are based on recombinant proteins or naked DNA.
This allows for the removal of non-immunogenic components of a
pathogen that are unnecessary for the efficacy of the vaccine. It also
has the added advantage of allowing discrimination between infected
and vaccinated individuals/animals by serological examination, as
individuals/animals that are infected with a pathogen will harbor
components of that organism unrelated to the vaccine in their serum.
However, protein subunit vaccines can be less immunogenic than
traditional vaccines and require co-administration with an immuno-
logical substance or ‘adjuvant’ to boost the immune response. A good
adjuvant works by promoting inflammatory responses at the site of
antigen delivery to attract activated macrophage and dendritic cells
(DCs) to improve antigen uptake and presentation. In doing so,
a good adjuvant will facilitate co-stimulation of T and B cells to
enhance production of antigen-specific acquired immunity. This
distinguishing feature of an adjuvant makes TLRs prime candidates

 in vaccine development. Although not known at the time, the earliest
vaccines actually contained bacterial contaminants that activated TLRs
and served as adjuvants.19 This includes Edward Jenners use of lesions
containing vaccinia virus from cowpox patients that activates TLR9,
to ‘vaccinate’ against smallpox the causative agent of which is variola
virus. Similarly, heat-killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Freunds
complete adjuvant developed in the late 1950s contained ligands for
TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9.
TLRS AND ACQUIRED IMMUNITY
The activation of TLRs by their respective ligands has an informative
role in directing acquired immunity. The generation of acquired
immunity begins with the recognition of pathogen-associated patterns
by TLRs on antigen presenting cells (APCs), mainly DCs in the
peripheral tissues. From here DCs travel to the draining lymph nodes
where they interact with T lymphocytes. Subsequently, a succession of
events helps generate and differentiate T cells to establish adaptive
responses. TLR activation upregulates expression of the costimulatory
molecules CD80/CD86 and CD40 on the surface of DCs. The
interaction between these molecules and CD28 and CD40 ligand on
naive CD4+ T cells enhances APC activity. Secondly, ligation of
T-cell receptors by the presentation of antigen peptides via major
histocompatibility complex II on DCs is established. Finally and most
importantly, the cytokine profile present within the microenvironment
of T-cell activation finalizes T-cell differentiation.20 Cells of the innate
immune system release these cytokines in a TLR-dependent manner.
Hence recognition of pathogen-associated patterns via TLRs directs
the main pathways by which DCs become activated and mature to
provide signals to naive T cells and tailor responses. Naive T cells
are primed toward specific T helper profiles: Th1, Th2, Th17 and
T regulatory cell (Treg) subsets (Figure 2).21
TLRS AND T HELPER CELLS
Signaling via TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 promotes Th1 type
responses, whereas activation of TLR5, TLR2/1 and TLR2/6 favors Th2
type responses.20 Th1 cells aid responses to intracellular pathogens and
bacteria, whereas Th2 cells are accountable for responses to parasitic
infections and allergies. There is strong evidence that TLRs drive Th1
responses via the release of IL-12p70 and IFNα from APCs and an
increased Th2 response is observed in MyD88-deficient mice with
impaired TLR signaling.22,23 Importantly, Th1 cells produce IL-12,
TNFα and IFNγ and induce B cells to release high levels of IgG and
IgA antibodies that drive phagocytic activation and defence against
intracellular pathogens (that is, influenza). Dysregulation of Th1
type responses to self-antigen or commensal flora leads to tissue
destruction and autoimmune disease. Differentiation to a Th2 lineage
is driven by IL-10 and IL-4. Th2 cells release IL-4, IL-5 and IL-10 and
induce the production of IgG, IgA and specifically IgE antibodies
important for immunity to parasitic infections (that is, Schistosoma
mansoni). Dysregulation of a Th2 type response is associated with
allergy and asthma. Importantly, Th1 polarizing cytokines inhibit the
differentiation of Th2 cells.21
Activation of TLRs on APCs also induces secretion of IL-21 and
IL-23, which drive differentiation toward a Th17 phenotype. Th17
cells have a prominent role in bacterial and fungal infections particular
at mucosal sites. Th17 type responses are characterized by the release
of IL-17 and IL-23. These cytokines act by modulating B- and T-cell
functions, particularly those of Treg cells. Treg cells are key players in
maintaining peripheral T cell tolerance. These cells patrol the host
organs against activation of self-reactive cells during steady state as
well as during infections.20 TLR activation of DCs and other APCs can
result in the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10,
which promotes Treg cell proliferation and Treg-mediated suppression
of the inflammatory cytokines IL-12p40, TNFα and IL-6. Current
thinking proposes that the suppressive function of Treg cells can be
augmented or attenuated depending on the nature of TLR stimulation
in order to maximize responses against pathogens and minimize
potential damage to the host. For example, increased activation
of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR5 causes increased Treg function, while
activation of TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 can decrease Treg functions.
Following maturation, DCs also have the ability to cross present
antigen in the context of major histocompatibility complex class I

 molecules to CD8+ T cells. This aids the generation of a cytotoxic
T lymphocyte (CTL) response, an important mechanism for effective
vaccine responses against intracellular pathogens. CTL responses have
been demonstrated in the context of TLR3 and TLR9 stimulation.24
Hence, the nature of a particular infection or disease state will
influence the activation status of certain TLRs and ultimately direct
the type of T-cell responses involved. This along with our under-
standing of signaling and the Th-biasing properties of TLRs is
harnessed in the development of vaccines with TLR-based adjuvants.
TLR DESIGNER ADJUVANTS AND THERAPEUTICS
Many preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the use of
purified TLR agonists as adjuvants. Equally, due to the significant role of
TLRs in inflammation, molecules that antagonize or inhibit TLR
signaling pathways have showed considerable potential as therapeutics
against a variety of inflammatory diseases and autoimmune conditions.
A major challenge in both areas is optimizing efficacy and required
responses while keeping unwanted immune side effects at bay.
TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR 4
TLR4 was the first TLR identified in mammals and is certainly the most
studied member of the TLR family.25 The potency with which this TLR
activates inflammatory pathways makes it an ideal target for therapeutic
intervention and adjuvant development. A broad range of clinical studies
have examined the adjuvant activity of TLR4 activators in vaccines
against infectious and tumor antigens. TLR4 recognizes the active lipid A
component of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria in
conjunction with MD2, CD14 and LPS-binding protein.26,27 Although
LPS is the most immunostimulatory and studied TLR4 ligand, it is a
highly toxic molecule hindering its use as a vaccine adjuvant.
Importantly, the lipid A portion of the parental LPS molecule mediates
its potency and interaction with TLR4.28 As a result, most clinical trials
involving TLR4 adjuvants examine LPS derivatives or lipid A analogs.
One such derivative monophospholipid A (MPLA) is purified from LPS
of Salmonella minnesota. It has 0.1% of the toxicity of LPS and is made
up of a heterogeneous combination of MPLA molecules that vary in
length and type of fatty acid acylation. MPLA can induce NF-κB activity,
cytokine secretion and the maturation and trafficking of DCs to draining
lymph nodes. It further induces cytokine cascades of both Th1 and Th2
type responses; however, a preferential bias toward induction of a Th2
phenotype has been reported.29
Pollinex Quattro (Allergy Therapeutics, West Sussex, UK) is a
vaccine containing MPLA, combined with ragweed pollen extract and
is used for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis in Europe.30 As of
March 2015, Allergy Therapeutics announced progression of Pollinex
Quattro through to Food Drug and Administration approval and
planned launch in the United States in 2019. MPLA has been
combined with other adjuvants in several vaccines. Combinations
include: MPLA in conjunction with quillaja saponaria 21 (QS21) and
liposomes (AS01, GlaxoSmithKline GSK Vaccines, Middlesex, UK);
QS21 and an oil-in-water emulsion (AS02 (GSK)); and alum (AS04
(GSK)). The addition of AS04 to a hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine
lead to FENDrix, which proved very successful and the vaccine is in
use. The formulation is well tolerated and induces higher antibody
titers than previously licensed HBV vaccines (Engerix-B).31,32 AS04
has also been studied in the formulation of cancer vaccines. Melacine
consists of lysates from two melanoma cell lines combined with
DETOX (also known as Enhanzyn), an adjuvant made up of AS04 and
the cell wall products from Mycobacterium phlei.33 Melacine is
approved by the Canadian Food Drug and Administration for the
treatment of metastatic melanoma.
Cervarix is another AS04 containing vaccine against human
pappilloma virus (HPV)34 and is used prophylactically for the
treatment of cervical cancer following its authorization by the
European Medicine Agency in 2007. Stimuvax is a cancer vaccine
formulation containing MUC1, a heavily glycosylated tumor antigen
and AS04, for prostate cancer or non-small cell lung carcinoma. While
initial studies were promising, Stimuvax did not meet primary
endpoints to show statistically significant improvement in a Phase
III clinical trial of patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma.
However, AS04 remains one of the most successful adjuvants to date
and has also been tested in vaccines against other viral pathogens such
as herpes simplex virus (HSV)35 and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).36
Phase III clinical trials of AS01 as an adjuvant in Mosquirix for the
treatment of malaria in young children were recently completed.37 In
July 2015 the European Medicine Agency adopted a positive scientific
opinion on the use of Mosquirix outside of the EU. AS01 is also
demonstrated to induce Th1 type immunity and improve CD8+ T-cell
responses and antibody titers to antigens from tuberculosis, varicella
zoster virus and HIV.38–40 Similar to AS01, AS02 has been tested with
antigens to HBV, HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. However, AS02
elicited more balanced Th1/Th2 responses with shorter-lived protec-
tion and lower lymphoproliferative responses detected over AS01.41
AS02 also induces higher CD8+ T-cell responses than AS04. More
recently, a new class of synthetic lipid A mimetics have been
developed, the aminoalkyl glucosaminide 4-phosphates.42 In contrast
to MPLA, aminoalkyl glucosaminide 4-phosphates are synthesized at
very high purity as single chemical entities and can be modified to
alter biological activity. Ribi.529 (also known as RC-529) is a leading
aminoalkyl glucosaminide 4-phosphate used in the human HBV
recombinant antigen vaccine, Supervax®. The triggering of TLR4 via
Ribi.529 (RC-529) has been used in experimental approaches to
improve
vaccines
for
HIV
infection.43
Ribi.529
and
another
aminoalkyl glucosaminide 4-phosphate, E6020, have been tested
against Listeria monocytogenes, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus,44
malaria and cardiac disease. In addition, the Infectious Disease
Research
Institute (IDRI),
USA,
have
developed
the
adjuvant
glucopyranosyl lipid A (GLA). This is a hexalyated lipid A derivative
of MPLA. GLA is similar in its immunomodulatory activity but more
potent at driving T cell activation than MPLA. A formulation of
GLA in an oil-in-water emulsion (GLA-SE) has been most effective.
GLA-SE has been tested in several preclinical subunit vaccine studies
targeting herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2), Schistosomiasis, respiratory
syncytial virus and the perioperative treatment of cancers to reduce
metastasis to name a few.45–48 All of which indicate GLA is safe and a
viable adjuvant that is currently on a clinical path.
In terms of therapeutics, structural understanding of the interaction
between TLR4 and lipid A analogs has been exploited to develop
antagonists. Eritoran (E5564) is a synthetic analog of lipid A.
Structural studies of TLR4–MD2 complexed with Eritoran determined
that the interactions are mediated by a hydrophobic internal pocket in
MD2,13 and as such it acts as a TLR4 antagonist. In human
monocytes, Eritoran inhibited the production of LPS induced TNFα
and IL-6.49 Eritoran progressed successfully to Phase III clinical trials
for the treatment of sepsis. However, in 2011 Eritoran failed to meet
clinical endpoints and Eisai Pharmaceuticals announced they would
not be applying for marketing authorization for the drug in the
treatment of severe sepsis. Given sepsis is a notoriously difficult
indication perhaps with a more robust trial design, future Phase III
trials utilizing drugs for sepsis treatment may have greater success. The
TLR4-targeted antagonist AV411 (Ibudilast) has been identified as a
potential treatment of pain associated with neurological indications.

 Opioids are demonstrated to possess TLR4 agonistic properties and
TLR4 is implicated as a key microglial receptor for the initiation of
neuropathic pain via the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines
including TNFα and IL-1.50 A TLR4 antagonist such as AV411 may
be used to block this. Phase II clinical trials looking at AV411 for
treatment of neuropathic pain in 2008 demonstrated the antagonist
was well tolerated in humans.51 AV411 is already used in Asia for the
treatment of asthma and post-stroke disorders. A novel peptide
inhibitor, VIPER (derived from vaccinia virus protein A46), has been
described to inhibit TLR4-dependent signaling via blocking TIR–TIR
domain interactions.52 Latest research with VIPER demonstrates
the attenuation of blood pressure and inflammatory responses in
hypertensive rats.53 TLR4 targeted monoclonal antibody NI-0101
(Novimmunne) binds an epitope on TLR4 and as a result inhibits
dimerization reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine production. This
antibody has several potential indications including asthma and
rheumatoid arthritis. NI-0101 is the first antibody for TLR4 to pass
Phase I clinical trials for safety and tolerability.54 Due to the potent
inflammatory responses mediated via TLR4 activation, agonists
and biologics targeting the receptor comprise a promising class of
therapeutics.
TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR 2
TLR2 forms functional heterodimers with TLR1, TLR6 and possibly
TLR10 to recognize a variety of lipoproteins from microorganisms.
TLR1/2 dimers are receptors for triacyl lipopeptides found in bacteria
and mycobacteria.3 TLR6 associates with TLR2 to recognize diacyl
lipopeptides such as M. fermentans macrophage-activating lipopeptide
(MALP-2). The level of TLR2 activation is increased by the presence of
CD14 and CD36. Synthetic triacylated and diacylated lipoproteins for
TLR2 activation include Pam3Cys and Pam2Cys, respectively. The
known Th2-bias of TLR2 activation and availability of highly specific
synthetic ligands for TLR2 provides great opportunities to harness
TLR2-induced immune responses for adjuvant purposes. Certainly,
lipopeptides represent the most broadly used ligand to target TLR2 in
this context.
Two
strategies
are
taken
when
targeting
TLR2
in
vaccine
development; (1) bacterial or synthetic lipopeptides are conjugated
to peptides or (2) palmitic acid is covalently linked to peptide antigens.
Bacterial lipopeptides are most frequently used as they contain
an acylated s-glycerylcysteine moiety to which a peptide can be
conjugated via a cysteine residue. LYMErix is a vaccine containing
Pam3Cys linked to the C terminus epitope of outer surface protein A
(OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lime disease.
Three doses of the vaccine improve protective immunity by 475%
and the vaccine was licensed in 1998. However, following concerns
over skewed Treg responses towards a Th17 profile and autoimmune
side effects the vaccine was withdrawn from the market.55 Recently,
while addressing different adjuvants effects of influenza subunit
vaccines, a role for TLR2 activation in leukocyte migration to
inflammation foci was suggested. Pam3Cys was more efficient than
TLR9 and TLR7/8 ligands, CpG and resiquimod respectively, at
inducing early recruitment of leukocytes, mainly neutrophils, to the
site of injection. This observation correlated with a higher capacity of
Pam3Cys to induce antibody responses against influenza antigens.56
An experimental vaccine of a saturated fatty acid and TLR2 activator,
palmitic acid conjugated to a HBV core antigen and T helper
lymphocyte peptide known as Theradigm-HBV has been trialed.
The vaccine induced higher HBV-specific CTL responses and longer
term immunity than its un-palmitolated counterpart.57 Similarly,
a vaccine against HIV-1 Tat protein in conjunction with lipopeptides
as an adjuvant also showed long-lived antigen-specific CTL and
humoral responses in preclinical tests.58 Furthermore, bacterial porins
are candidate molecules currently in vaccine development. Examples
include the outer membrane proteins OmpS1 and OmpS2 from
Salmonella Typhi, which activate TLR2 and TLR4 for development in a
vaccine to typhoid fever.59 Similarly, PorB from Neisseria meningitides
has been shown to promotes Th2-driven cellular immune response in
a TLR2-dependent manner.60 The incorporation of TLR2 ligands
during vaccine development is relatively easy, allowing simplified
production of completely synthetic vaccines. TLR2 adjuvants also
boost cell-mediated responses and high antibody titers that would
prove beneficial in preventing disease. However, the ability of TLR2-
adjuvant vaccines to produce CTL responses is less impressive. As a
result the benefits of targeting TLR2 for vaccine development are still
debatable and more studies are required.
Multiple studies have implicated a role for TLR2 in tissue damage
caused
by
ischemia/reperfusion
injury
associated
with
stroke,
myocardial infarction and solid organ transplantation. This has
provided rationale for the development of TLR2-targeted biologics.
Opsona Therapeutics, Dublin, Ireland. have developed OPN-305, a
humanized monoclonal TLR2 antibody with the ability to block both
TLR1/2- and TLR2/6-mediated signaling and reduce TLR2-mediated
pro-inflammatory cytokine production. In March of 2015 OPN-305
progressed into the second part of phase II clinical trials for prevention
of delayed renal graft function. Phase I/II clinical trials also began
in early 2015 for prevention of low- and intermediate-risk myelodys-
plastic syndrome, a diseases that affects normal blood cell production
in the bone marrow.
On the other hand, the TLR2 agonist SMP105 (Dainippon
Sumitomo
Pharma)
a
preparation
of
the
cell
wall
skeleton
components of Mycobacterium bovis, BCG, Tokyo, Japan, has been
investigated for potential therapeutic benefits in cancer. SMP105 was
demonstrated to activate NFκB in a TLR2- and MyD88-dependent
manner. Administration of SMP105 enhanced levels of CTLs
and IFN-producing cells and reduced tumor growth in mice.61
Arabinomycolates
(glycolipids)
isolated
from SMP105
are
also
demonstrated to possess adjuvant activity similar to SMP105 itself.62
Recent studies indicate great potential for SMP105 as an immuno-
therapy in delayed-type hypersensitivity and in an anti-tumor model
in rats.63 However, SMP105 is not yet in clinical use. OM-174 is a lipid
A analog with dual action on TLR2 and TLR4. In a Phase I trial
completed in 2013 the biologic was tested for efficacy against
refractory solid tumors in adults.64 The therapy was well tolerated at
biologically active concentrations and further studies are planned in
combination with chemotherapy, as animal models suggest a strong
synergistic anti-tumor effect. The wide variety of studies investigating
TLR2-targeted therapeutics and adjuvants highlight that targeting
TLR2 may be beneficial for a wide range of indications.
TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR 3
TLR3 ligands are considered excellent candidates as vaccine adjuvants.
TLR3 binds dsRNA of viral origin while two synthetic TLR3 ligands
mimicking dsRNA, polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid (poly I:C)
and
polyadenylic-polyuridylic
acid
(polyA:U),
have
also
been
described.3 Importantly, it has been demonstrated extensively that
TLR3 activation leads to cross-priming of CD8+ T cells via major
histocompatibility complex I for the generation of CTL responses.
Furthermore, TRIF-dependant signaling following TLR3 activation
results in the upregulation of type I IFNs, which further enhances this
process. The synthetic TLR3 ligand, poly I:C activates mucosal and
systemic humoral responses when co-administered intranasally with

 an inactivated influenza vaccine. This results in complete protection
against homologous and heterologous influenza viruses, including the
highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus.65 However, it is known
that the adjuvant effects of poly I:C require cooperative activation of
TLR3 and cytoplasmic RNA helicase MDA5 pathways.66
Murine models studying the efficacy of peptide-based cancer
vaccines have demonstrated that poly I:C enhances tumor-specific
T-cell responses. However, unfortunately this anti-tumor effect was
not observed in humans due to degradation by nucleases.67 To prevent
this derivatives were produced: polyICLC and poly I:C12U (known as
Ampligen), which retain the immunostimulatory properties and
exhibits less toxicity than poly I:C. Ampligen is currently in Phase I/II
clinical trials to test its immunogenicity and safety when administered
with the approved and currently used intranasal flu vaccine FluMist.
Ampligen Phase II and III clinical trials have also been performed for
cancer and HIV vaccine studies, respectively, and it has been deemed
safe to use and induces secretion of IL-12, maturation of DCs and
enhances antigen-specific CTL responses and CD4+ T cell responses.
Ampligen
also has
therapeutic
potential
for
other
indications
including: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Hepatitis and HPV. A cationic
adjuvant formulation known as CAF01, incorporates two liposomal
components with synthetic mycobacterial cord factor.68 CAF01 can
prime protective Th1, Th17 and antibody responses in animal models
of bacterial, viral and parasitic infections. Phase I clinical trials have
been conducted for Tuberculosis using CAF01. Poly I:C has been
combined with CAF01 to produce CAF05, which enhances CD8+
T cells in addition to the adjuvant effects of CAF01. These types of
combinational adjuvant trials highlight the promise TLR3 agonists
possess to activate broad, systemic immune responses.
TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR 5
TLR5 is expressed on the surface of most immune cells and recognizes
flagellin, a constituent protein of bacterial flagella.3 Flagellin interacts
with TLR5 via a conserved region within flagellin, the D1 portion/
domain. Both soluble monomeric and polymeric forms of the ligand
have been shown in experimental models to interact with TLR5 and
have adjuvant properties, including the upregulation of costimulatory

proliferation and secretion of IL-10 and TNFα by monocytes.69
A synthetic derivative of flagellin, Entolimod (CBLB502) is being
developed by Cleveland BioLabs New York, NY, USA. Entolimod was
studied in a murine model of acute ischemic renal failure where
administration within 30 min of reperfusion of the ischemic kidney
provided protection from injury, attenuated leukocyte and neutrophil
infiltration and reduced elevated diagnostic markers of renal dysfunc-
tion normally associated with renal failure.70 The biologic was also
shown to elicit protective effects in radiation induced injury. It does so
by inducing factors that aid in suppressing apoptosis, scavenging
reactive oxygen species and promoting tissue regeneration. The
company has recently released results of a Phase I trial with Entolimod
in advanced cancer patients, where it was well tolerated with safety and
immunological data suggesting it could be combined with chemother-
apeutic or other immunotherapeutic anticancer agents or vaccines. A
second Phase I study is currently ongoing in patients with advanced
cancer in the Russian Federation to expand on clinical observations
using higher doses than used in the initial trial. More generally,
immunization of flagellin containing vaccines induces the secretion of
antigen-specific IgG and local IgA responses. VAX102 (produced by
VaxInnate) is a recombinant fusion protein linking four copies of the
ectodomain of influenza virus matrix protein 2 (M2e) antigen to
Salmonella typhimurium flagellin. The addition of flagellin enhanced
immune responses compared to those without flagellin and thus
VAX102 may be useful for the broad protection of influenza A. Phase
I trials yielded promising results, inducing a fourfold rise in anti-M2e
antibodies in humans.71 VaxInnate also have other influenza vaccines
in development. VAX125, which contains the H1 hemagglutinin
antigen linked to flagellin, which is hoped will be useful for elderly
patients72 and VAX2012Q comprised of four seasonal influenza
strains, each fused to a flagellin protein. Both adjuvants have
progressed to Phase II trials. Recent studies have made significant
advances in our understanding of the binding of TLR5 to its ligand
and will aid the development of TLR5 agonists as adjuvants.15
TLR7 AND TLR8
TLR7 and TLR8 are structurally related, expressed on endosomes and
recognize microbial nucleic acids. This includes single-stranded RNA
from viruses enriched for U or GU-rich oligoribonucleotides such as
RNA40 from the U5 region of HIV-1 RNA.73 TLR7/8 activation is
also achieved by synthetically complexed single-stranded RNAs
known as Imidazoquinolines such as R-848 (Resiquimod) or R-837
(Imiquimod).
Imiquimod
predominantly
activates
TLR7
and
Resiquimod triggers both TLR7 and TLR8. As of yet no TLR7/8
agonists have been approved as vaccine adjuvants; however, most
preclinical studies have utilized Imiquimod. Of note, activation
of murine TLR7 but not human TLR7 can be achieved using
Resiquimod. Both Imiquimod and Resiquimod have undergone
extensive clinical testing as TLR agonist treatment (Aldara) for topical
treatment of HPV-induced warts and other indications including basal
cell and squamous cell carcinoma, lentigo maligna and actinic
keratosis.74 This treatment induces a cytotoxic T-cell response and
local secretion of IFNα, TNFα and IL-6 and drives DC activation.
Indeed, activators of TLR7/8 induce not only the upregulation of
costimulatory molecules and DC maturation, TLR7/8 also stimulate
the production of IgG and induction of cytokines from B cells
(for example, IL-6 and TNFα), and secretion of IFNγ by natural killer
cells. In preclinical studies targeting HIV, Imiquimod enhanced
antigen-specific T-cell responses and antibody secretion.75 In addition,
enhanced macrophage–dependent killing and resolution of lesions
has been reported following use of Imiquimod during Leishmania
infections. Systemic administration of Imiquimod is highly toxic and
studies looking at the safety and efficacy of TLR7/8 adjuvants have
been limited by the unresponsiveness of mice to TLR8 agonists for
human use.73 However, while TLR8 was initially considered only to be
active in humans and not in mice, activation of murine TLR8 has been
achieved with combination treatments of Imidazoquinolines and
polyT oligodeoxynucleotides and this may help negate this problem
in the future.76 Encouragingly, Resiquimod (3M Pharmaceuticals
Minnesota, MN, USA) has demonstrated positive results in a Phase
II clinical trial of genital HSV. The major benefit of TLR7/8 agonists as
adjuvants is their simultaneous stimulation of several cell types. Future
trials will help clarify whether or not TLR7/8 agonists can fulfill their
promise as effective anti-tumor treatments and/or vaccine adjuvants.
TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR 9
TLR9 is an intracellular TLR involved in the recognition of DNA from
bacterial and viral origin but also of self DNA in immune-complexes.
Non-self DNA is detected by the presence of unmethylated CpG
motifs. TLR9 is expressed by B cells and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs).
TLR9 stimulation induces activation of natural killer cells, T cells,
B cells, monocytes and macrophage.3 The resulting immune responses
include induction of pro-inflammatory and Th1 cytokines (for
example, IL-6, IL-1, TNFα, IFNγ and IL-12). In particular, IL-12

 and Type I IFNs induced by pDCs via TLR9 induce strong Th1 type
immunity and CTL cytotoxicity. Indeed, stimulating endosomal TLRs
is particularly effective at promoting the generation of CTL responses
capable of eliminating viral pathogens and cancer. Furthermore, TLR9
activation on B cells is involved in IgG class switching and humoral
responses.77
The immunostimulatory activity of bacterial DNA is mimicked by
synthetic oligonucleotides (ODN) harboring CpG motifs. CpG–ODNs
are used in vaccines and immunotherapies, as similar to native CpGs,
they have strong CD8+ T-cell responses. To date four classes of
ODNs
with
different
immunostimulatory
CpG
motifs
have
been characterized. Class A have a mixed phopsphodiester and
phosphorothioate backbone, contain polyG motifs and form large
structures. Class A ODNs activate pDCs to induce high levels of IFNα
yet have weak NFκB stimulating capability. Class B ODNs contain one
or more CpG motifs, do not form palindromic structures, have a
purely phosphorothioate backbone and activate B cells. Class C ODNs
have intermediate stimulatory properties as they form palindromic

 motifs and contain only a phosphorothioate backbone. With regard to
adjuvant development, the phopsphodiester backbone of ODNs is
susceptible to degradation by nucleases, while a phosphorothioate
backbone can bind non-specifically to proteins in serum causing
unwanted side effects. As a result efforts are made to develop
CpG–ODNs with a backbone solely consisting of phopsphodiester
and that are also resistant to nuclease activity and retain the
immunostimulatory properties of naturally occurring ODNs.78 To
this effect the addition of a polyG run to the 3’-end of a CpG–ODN
with a phopsphodiester backbone has proven effective.
Although co-administration of antigen with a given TLR agonist can
induce protective responses, agonist–antigen conjugates work particu-
larly well at boosting immunity. This is certainly the case for TLR9,
were murine studies show a 100-fold greater boost in immunity with
CpG–ODN conjugated to apoptotic tumor cells compared with
antigen and CpG–ODN mixtures. This works by directly delivering
both antigen and TLR activation to each APC/DC and CpG–ODN
administration was found to induce high numbers of tumor-specific
CD8+ T cells when co-administered with HPV and melanoma tumor
antigens. The ability of CpG–ODN to induce strong CTL responses is
harnessed in vaccines targeting cancer. An initial pilot study in 2008
supported preclinical finding’s to demonstrate that CpG–ODN
conjugated or co-administered with tumor antigen had the ability to
boost cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in melanoma patients.79 Furthermore,
subsequent vaccine trials made use of CpG–ODN as an adjuvant with
the synthetic tumor peptide melanoma-associated antigen recognized
by T cells 1 (MART1) and with NY-ESO-1 peptide antigen, and
demonstrated enhanced antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses. The
use of CpG 7909 (ProMune) as an adjuvant in a melanoma vaccine
comprising the synthetic tumor peptide melanoma-specific antigen A3
(MAGE-A3) showed partial success and was boosted by the addition
of MPLA and QS21 in a liposomal formulation to CpG 7909, known
as the AS15 adjuvant system.80 However, the administration of
CpG 7909 in conjunction with chemotherapy had no benefit for
progression free survival of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer
compared to those that received chemotherapy alone.81,82
Although TLR9 adjuvants certainly serve to reduce tumor growth
and size they rarely lead to complete tumor eradication. A key
explanation for this is the microenvironment of the tumors in
question. These environments are rich in factors that drive Tregs
and monocyte-derived suppressor cells that have the ability to
suppress the host’s tumor-specific immunity. A means of averting
this problem is the local delivery of TLR9 agonists as this promotes the
infiltration of the CD8+ T cells to the tumor site.83 Murine studies
have demonstrated reduced frequency of immunosuppressive Treg
cells within the tumor microenvironment following local delivery of
CpG ODN. Therefore, current thinking favors the local delivery of
CpG–ODN conjugated antigens for the treatment of cancer (Table 1).
CONCLUSION
TLR agonists have complex pleiotropic effects on the immune system
and are demonstrated to boost antigen-specific cellular and humoral
immunity. Following their initial discovery, the specificity with which
TLRs tailor responses was not fully appreciated. Today targeting
specific TLRs allows for the precise activation or inhibition of immune
responses with fewer side effects compared with drugs of alternative
mechanisms. In many respects this unique family of receptors acts as a
‘Swiss Army’ knife of the immune system with the capability of
responding in a multitude of infectious and disease states. This trait
has been exploited successfully and led to the development of many
small molecule biologics and vaccine adjuvants. However, challenges
certainly remain within the field. For example, large tumor micro-
environments are infiltrated with sizeable numbers of immunosup-
pressive cells that have the ability to hinder the tumoricidal activity of
CTL cells induced by TLR adjuvants. It is worth noting that targeting
multiple PRRs families may provide improved protective responses in
this context. Indeed, examples of synergy and crosstalk between TLR
and NOD agonists have already been reported. Activation of TLR4 can
synergize with NOD1 and NOD2 agonists to induce DC maturation.84
These strategies are an example of how improved adjuvant design is an
exciting ongoing endeavor. Encouragingly, continued advances in
understanding TLR and innate immune signaling will ultimately help
improve strategies for the prevention, treatment and cure of cancers,
infectious and autoimmune diseases.
