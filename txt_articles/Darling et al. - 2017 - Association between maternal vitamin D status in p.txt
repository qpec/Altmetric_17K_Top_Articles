Abstract
Seafood intake in pregnancy has been positively associated with childhood cognitive outcomes which could potentially relate to the high
vitamin D content of oily fish. However, whether higher maternal vitamin D status (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D)) in pregnancy is
associated with a reduced risk of offspring suboptimal neurodevelopmental outcomes is unclear. A total of 7065 mother–child pairs were
studied from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children cohort who had data for both serum total 25(OH)D concentration in
pregnancy and at least one measure of offspring neurodevelopment (pre-school development at 6–42 months; ‘Strengths and Difficulties
Questionnaire’ scores at 7 years; intelligence quotient (IQ) at 8 years; reading ability at 9 years). After adjustment for confounders, children of
vitamin D-deficient mothers (<50·0 nmol/l) were more likely to have scores in the lowest quartile for gross-motor development at 30 months
(OR 1·20; 95 % CI 1·03, 1·40), fine-motor development at 30 months (OR 1·23; 95 % CI 1·05, 1·44) and social development at 42 months
(OR 1·20; 95 % CI 1·01, 1·41) than vitamin D-sufficient mothers (≥50·0 nmol/l). No associations were found with neurodevelopmental
outcomes, including IQ, measured at older ages. However, our results suggest that deficient maternal vitamin D status in pregnancy may have
adverse effects on some measures of motor and social development in children under 4 years. Prevention of vitamin D deficiency may be
important for preventing suboptimal development in the first 4 years of life.

The consumption of fish, or nutrients present in fish, by preg-
nant women has been linked to neurocognitive development in
their children. In observational studies, maternal intake of fish
or seafood in pregnancy has been positively associated with
cognitive scores in the offspring(1–4), whereas children whose
mothers had eaten oily fish in early pregnancy had a reduced
risk of hyperactivity than those whose mothers did not eat oily
fish(3). Although these studies tended to interpret these asso-
ciations as effects of long-chain n-3 fatty acids, they might also
be explained by the fact that oily fish is the best dietary source
of vitamin D. Though the action of sunlight on the skin is the
predominant contributor to vitamin D status, dietary vitamin D
can play an important role in determining status, as measured
by the vitamin D metabolite, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D),
in serum or plasma(5). Dietary sources of vitamin D (especially
oily fish) are particularly important during the winter months
when endogenous production of vitamin D status is limited.
It is biologically plausible that vitamin D status in pregnant
mothers may affect child neurocognitive development as
vitamin D receptors are present in the brain(6) and maternal
vitamin D deficiency is known to be associated with abnormal
brain development in the young rat(7). In the period from birth
to weaning in rats, there appears to be a window during which
maternal vitamin D status affects offspring brain development(8)
and these developmental changes may not occur if vitamin D is
withheld until weaning(9). Furthermore, vitamin D deficiency in
late gestation can lead to impaired brain function in adult rats(8).
Due to differences between rat and human developmental
physiology, the extent to which these findings would apply to
humans remains unclear.
Few human studies have assessed the relationship between
maternal vitamin D status and neurodevelopmental outcomes.
The results of the five published observational studies that exist
are inconsistent(10–14). Indeed, this fact was recently highlighted

 in the report from Public Health England on Vitamin D and
Health from the Scientific Advisory Committee for Nutrition(15).
To address this lack of consistent evidence with respect to the
association between maternal vitamin D status and cognitive-
developmental outcomes in the offspring, we analysed data
from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children
(ALSPAC) cohort. Our a priori hypothesis was that poorer
maternal vitamin D status, as measured by serum 25(OH)D,
would be associated with increased probability of suboptimal
cognitive or behavioural development scores in children aged
6 months to 9 years.
Methods
Study design and participants
Details of ALSPAC methods have been detailed previously(16).
In brief, all pregnant women living in the former Avon area in
southwest England, who had an expected delivery date
between 1 April 1991 and 31 December 1992 were eligible for
inclusion. A total of 14 541 women were recruited, and there
were 13 617 mother–child pairs with singleton offspring alive at
one year. The ALSPAC study website contains details of all the
data that are available through a fully searchable data dictionary
(http://www.bris.ac.uk/alspac/). Our study sample consisted of
mother–child pairs that had both a serum 25(OH)D measure in
pregnancy and at least one neurodevelopmental outcome of
interest from 6 months to 9 years (Fig. 1). A range of outcomes
was explored, including motor development, communication
and social skills, behaviour, cognition and reading ability.
Outcomes
The ALSPAC pre-school development tests, which were based
on questionnaires completed by the mother when the child was
between 6 and 42 months of age, provided scores for four
domains: fine motor, gross motor, social development and
communication (details published previously(1)). The Strengths
and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)(17) was completed by
mothers when the child was 81 months of age and was used
to assess behavioural development. Intelligence quotient (IQ) at
age 8 years had been assessed in the ALSPAC clinic using
the abbreviated form of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for
Children, as previously described(1). Reading ability (accuracy,
comprehension and speed) was assessed at age 9 years by
trained psychologists using the Neale Analysis of Reading
Ability(18) and by asking children to read real words to derive
a reading score. Further details of these outcomes are available
in the online Supplementary Material.
Maternal vitamin D status
Although 25(OH)D has lower biological activity than the active
vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D),
serum/plasma 25(OH)D is widely regarded as the most reliable
marker of vitamin D status(19). Total maternal serum 25(OH)D
concentration (including both vitamin D2 and vitamin D3) in
ALSPAC mothers had been measured in a previous study by
HPLC and tandem MS, in accordance with Vitamin D External
Quality Assessment Scheme requirements; full details have been
published previously(20), including details of inter-assay CV(21).
Statistical analysis
The women with vitamin D measurements were compared with
the remaining ALSPAC women. We compared categorical
variables with χ2 tests and continuous variables with indepen-
dent t tests. We used median and inter-quartile range (IQR)
to describe maternal vitamin D status. Our main analysis
dichotomised women as deficient or sufficient using 25(OH)D
concentration
≤50·0 nmol/l
as
the
cut-off
for
vitamin
D
deficiency, as in previous ALSPAC work(20). We did additional
supplementary
analyses
by
dividing
women
into
three
categories (<25·0, 25·0–49·9 and ≥50·0 nmol/l) to explore the
dose–response relationship.
We used logistic regression to examine the relationship
between maternal vitamin D status in pregnancy and odds of
suboptimal development with the women in the vitamin
D-sufficient group (>50·0 nmol/l) as the reference category. We
did not input missing confounder or outcome data with repla-
cement values. We defined suboptimal development as scores
in the lowest quartile for all subscales of early development,
IQ and reading ability, as in previous ALSPAC research(1,22).
For the SDQ, suboptimal behaviour was defined according
to published cut-offs (for both the individual scales and
overall score) that indicate borderline/abnormal behaviour(17)
(see the Supplementary Material, Study Outcomes). Model
predictors were assessed for potential multicollinearity. For our
final model, variance inflation factor ranged from 1·02 to 2·2
(accordingly tolerance ranged from 0·5–0·99) depending on
the variable.
As vitamin D status and childhood cognitive and behavioural
development are affected by a range of factors(23,24), we included
potential confounders in our analysis. The confounders chosen
were based on previous ALSPAC findings(1,22) and were from
questionnaire and clinic-based data (Table 1). We included ten
categorical and two continuous variables. The two continuous
variables were maternal age (years), and maternal BMI (kg/m2).
As there is a well-established relationship between BMI and
25(OH)D concentration(25), maternal BMI was included in the
model, even though it was not statistically associated with
25(OH)D in this data set (Table 1).
The ten
categorical
variables
comprised three
groups:
(i) child factors (sex and breast-feeding (none or some)),
(ii) maternal factors (ethnicity (white or non-white), tobacco use
in the first trimester (smoker or non-smoker), parity (zero, one
or more) and oily-fish intake in pregnancy (never/rarely or
once a fortnight or more)) and (iii) markers of socio-economic
development (maternal education (low = less than O-level or
equivalent; medium = O-level and high = greater than O-level),
home
ownership
(mortgaged/owned,
privately
rented
or
housing
association/council
rented/other),
maternal
social
class based on her occupation (non-manual and manual)
and crowding in the home (less than or equal to one person
or greater than one person per room)). We also included
two variables to control for variation in the vitamin D

 measurement: gestation (week) and season of sample collec-
tion (spring (March, April and May), summer (June, July and
August) autumn (September, October and November) and
winter (December, January and February)). Although it is
unlikely that the age of the child at assessment would be con-
founded by maternal vitamin D status, outcomes were adjusted
for child age at the 6-month measurement, owing to the strong
association between age and outcomes at this early life stage.
We used three models to adjust the analysis for potential
confounders. As 25(OH)D measurements spanned pregnancy,
and as gestational week is associated with vitamin D status(26),
we do not present unadjusted data; our minimally adjusted
model (model 1) included gestational week of 25(OH)D
measurement. Model 2 built on model 1 by including nine
confounders associated with both vitamin D status (Table 1)
and cognitive development (parity, tobacco smoking, housing
status, crowding, maternal age, BMI, education, ethnic group
and social class) and two child factors (sex and breast-feeding).
Model 3 included model 2 confounders plus two variables (oily
fish intake and season of vitamin D measurement) that could
affect maternal vitamin D status though including these may
represent an over-control.
We used simulations to assess the impact of multiple
comparisons. We generated 5000 data sets where 25(OH)D

 maintained the same number of observations and, with all other
data unchanged, the correlations between outcomes and
confounders were preserved. The analyses were based upon
model 3. The effect of randomisation was to generate a set of
results under the null hypothesis to which our set of observed
results could be compared. A composite score across the
twenty-seven outcomes was based upon the sum of P values.
These were modified to one-sided tests to allow results in the
same direction to contribute consistently to the score, whether
statistically significant or not. P values in the tables are not
corrected for multiple comparisons.
Sensitivity analysis
We conducted analyses with two additional confounders
(added to model 3) that might be on the causal pathway: pre-
term birth (<37 or ≥37 weeks) and birth weight (<2500 or
≥2500 g). We also explored the effect of including maternal
iodine status in the first trimester (sufficient (≥150 μg/g) or
deficient (<150 μg/g)) as we have previously shown that this is
associated with child cognition in the ALSPAC cohort(22). As just
787 women also had a measure of iodine status in the first
trimester, we used a simplified model (total of thirteen con-
founders) to ensure that the model would converge (we
dropped ethnicity and crowding in the home as a result of low
numbers in the categories of those variables).
As there is ongoing controversy in the published literature with
respect to the definition of vitamin D deficiency(27), we
conducted sensitivity analyses using a wide range of vitamin D
status, namely <25·0 and <75·0 nmol/l as cut-offs (online
Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). Assumptions concerning
statistical significance were based on interpretation of CI,
rather than P values, wherever possible, and multiple testing was
assessed as described above. Analyses were conducted using the
Statistical Package for Social Sciences (version 21.0; SPSS, Inc.).
Ethics
The ALSPAC study was conducted according to the guidelines
laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki. All procedures
involving human subjects were approved by the ALSPAC Ethics
and Law Committee and the Local Research Ethics Committees.
Written informed consent was obtained from participants
(or from their parent/guardian if under 18 years old).
Role of the funding source
The funding bodies did not have a role in the study design, data
collection, data analysis, data interpretation or writing of the
report. The corresponding author had full access to all the study
data used and final responsibility to submit for publication.
Results
Compared with the remainder of the ALSPAC cohort (defined as
mother-singleton child pairs from the core sample surviving to
one year), the mother–child pairs in this study were more
likely to be older, of white ethnicity, with markers of higher
socio-economic status (e.g. a higher proportion of breast-
feeding mothers, higher educational attainment and social class
and a lower proportion of smokers (online Supplementary
Table S1)). However, some of the actual differences were small
(e.g. maternal age 28·3 (SD 4·8) v. 27·7 (SD 4·7) years). The
median 25(OH)D concentration for all 7065 women with a
child that had at least one relevant outcome was 61·3
(IQR 42·9–84·7) nmol/l, with 4·4 % having <25·0 nmol/l, 34·6 %
having <50·0 nmol/l and 65·7 % having <75·0 nmol/l.
The median gestational week of vitamin D measurement
(available for 7064 women) was 29·6 (IQR 12·7–33·3) weeks,
with 26·1 % in the first trimester (≤13 weeks), 11·8 % in the
second trimester (IQR 14–27) weeks and 62·1 % in the third
trimester (≥28 weeks). The median 25(OH)D measurement was
54·9
(IQR
40·1–72·5) nmol/l
in
the
first
trimester,
59·3
(IQR 38·6–84·2) nmol/l in the second trimester and 65·3
(IQR 45·2–90·4) nmol/l in the third trimester. Table 1 shows the
confounders associated with maternal vitamin D status using
the 50 nmol/l cut-off. Women with 25(OH)D concentration
≥50·0 nmol/l were more likely to be white, older, and have
markers of higher socio-economic status (e.g. education, home
ownership and reduced smoking and crowding).
Results of logistic regression models using the cut-off value
for serum 25(OH)D of <50·0 nmol/l to define deficiency are
shown in Table 2. In the minimally adjusted analysis (model 1),
the only outcomes associated with vitamin D status were verbal
IQ at 8 years and words read per minute at 9 years of age
(Table 2). However, after adjustment for potential confounders,
the effect on IQ and reading was attenuated and the only
outcomes that remained statistically significant were gross- and
fine-motor development at 30 months and social development
at 42 months. With further adjustment for oily-fish intake and
season (model 3), the association between maternal vitamin D
status and gross-motor development also became significant at
18 months, whereas remaining associated with gross-motor and
fine-motor development at 30 months and social development
at 42 months (Table 2). Children born to mothers with 25(OH)D
≤50·0 nmol/l were more likely to have scores in the bottom
quartile for these variables.
For the ALSPAC pre-school development assessments, when
the serum 25(OH)D of <50·0 nmol/l group was divided into
<25·0 and 25·0–49·9 nmol/l, there was evidence of a statistically
significant trend to decreasing risk of suboptimal development
with higher maternal 25(OH)D concentration for gross-motor
skills at 18 (P = 0·02) and 30 months (P = 0·008), fine-motor skills
at 30 months (P = 0·01) and social development at 42 months
(P = 0·02), after adjustment for all twelve confounders in model 3
(Table 3). The effect sizes were larger for odds of suboptimal
development in children of mothers in the serum 25(OH)D
<25·0 nmol/l
group,
than
for
the
serum
25(OH)D
of
25·0–49·9 nmol/l group (with the ≥50·0 nmol/l group as the
comparison group) for all outcomes except fine-motor devel-
opment at 18 months and social development at 30 months.
The interaction between gestational week of 25(OH)D mea-
surement and the vitamin D variable (i.e. deficient v. sufficient
status) was significant for only two of twenty-seven outcomes:
fine-motor skills at 30 months and performance IQ (Table 4).
However, when the analysis was restricted to the ALSPAC

 pre-school development assessments and was split into early
(≤22 weeks) and late gestation (>22 weeks), the results sug-
gested that the effect of deficient v. sufficient vitamin D status on
the majority of tests was greater in the second half of gestation.
The effect sizes were generally larger in the second half of
gestation and results were significant (Table 4) for gross-motor
development at 18 months (OR 0·97; 95 % CI 0·76, 1·23 v. OR
1·31; 95 % 1·08, 1·58) and 30 months (OR 1·07; 95% CI 0·84,1·38 v.
OR 1·28; 95% CI 1·05, 1·57), fine-motor development at 30 months
(0·99; 95% CI 0·76, 1·29 v. OR 1·37; 95% CI 1·12, 1·67) and
social development at 42 months (OR 1·07; 95% CI 0·82, 1·41
v. OR 1·28; 95 % CI 1·03, 1·58). There were no significant asso-
ciations in either half of gestation for other neurodevelopmental
outcomes, including the SDQ, IQ or reading ability (Table 4).
Multiple comparisons
Although only four results in Table 2 were nominally significant
at the 5 % level, it was noted that twenty-five of the twenty-
seven results in model 3 showed a detrimental effect for low
vitamin D status. Such a result would be highly significant
(P < 0·0001) if the outcomes were independent. In practice,

 outcomes were correlated with an average r 0·12 (range –0·03 to
0·69). The impact of these correlations was assessed using
simulations. The scores from the 5000 simulated data sets had a
mean of 13·52 (SD 2·78). This compared with an expected mean
of 13·5 (SD 1·5) if all the outcomes had been independent. The
observed results had a score of 6·93 suggesting an empirical two-
tail P value of 0·016. Sequential analyses by removing those
outcomes with the strongest association from the simulated
scores suggested that three outcomes (gross and fine-motor
development at 30 months and social development at 42 months)
had robust associations with the other twenty-four outcomes
having associations consistent with chance (P = 0·051).
We also explored defining the score based upon the logit
transformation, ln(P/(1 − P)). Using this definition, the score
more closely approximated to a normal distribution. However
this did not change the conclusions.
Sensitivity analysis
When we added the variables, preterm birth and birth weight,
to model 3, the results were fundamentally unchanged (online
Supplementary Table S2), though the effect of maternal vitamin D
status on gross-motor development at 18 months and social
development at 42 months was no longer statistically significant.
The addition of suboptimal iodine:creatinine ratio in the first
trimester to model 3 resulted in considerable sample attrition
given the low number of women with iodine measurements
(n 787) (online Supplementary Table S2). Though the effect sizes
were larger than previously, the associations between maternal
vitamin D and gross-motor development at 18 and 30 months and
social development at 42 months were no longer significant,
though they remained significant for fine-motor development at
18 (OR 1·50; 95% CI 1·02, 2·23) and 30 months (OR 1·61; 95 % CI
1·06, 2·46).
We explored whether dichotomising women according to
different 25(OH)D cut-offs (25·0 or 75·0 nmol/l) changed the
results (online Supplementary Tables S3 and S4), bearing in
mind the lower relative statistical power that results when the
cut-off leads to unequal numbers in each group (the 50·0 nmol/l
cut-off was close to the median 25(OH)D concentration of
54·9 nmol/l). When using the 25·0 nmol/l cut-off, the only out-

ALSPAC, Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children; IQ, intelligence quotient.
* Suboptimal outcome defined as scores in the bottom quartile for ALSPAC pre-school development assessments, cognition and reading ability. Published cut-offs(17) were used for
behaviour: prosocial (≤5; 9·8 %), peer problems (≥3; 13·5 %), hyperactivity (≥6; 18·7 %), emotional symptoms (≥4; 12·2 %), conduct problems (≥3; 24·3 %) and total score (≥14;
10·5 %). Maternal vitamin D status >50·0 nmol/l was the reference group.
† Model 1 adjusted for gestational week of vitamin D measurement.
‡ Model 2: gestational week of vitamin D measurement plus additional eleven variables: maternal age, maternal BMI, maternal ethnic group, maternal education, maternal social
class, parity, tobacco smoking in first trimester, home ownership status, crowding index, child sex, breast-feeding.
§ Model 3: additionally adjusted for oily fish and season of vitamin D measurement.

 model was gross-motor development at 30 months (OR 1·43;
95 % CI 1·01, 2·02); results approached statistical significance for
other outcomes (e.g. social development at 42 months, OR 1·40;
95 % CI 0·97, 2·02; online Supplementary Table S3). Using a cut-
off of 75·0 nmol/l to define deficiency resulted in null associa-
tions with the ALSPAC pre-school development assessments,
behaviour and cognitive tests, but was associated with higher
odds of suboptimal reading accuracy at 9 years (OR 1·26; 95 %
CI 1·01, 1·57); however, this may be a chance finding as reading
accuracy was not associated with vitamin D in any other ana-
lyses (Tables 2–4 and online Supplementary Tables S2 and S3).
Discussion
After adjustment for potential confounders, children born to
vitamin D-deficient mothers (serum 25(OH)D of <50·0 nmol/l)
were more likely to have suboptimal gross-motor skills at
30 months, suboptimal fine-motor skills at 30 months and
suboptimal social development scores at 42 months than were
children born to sufficient mothers (≥50·0 nmol/l). Although the
effect sizes were relatively small, we consider that the findings
were biologically meaningful. Interestingly, no associations
were found between maternal vitamin D status and other
outcomes (IQ, reading ability).
These results suggest that the vitamin D content of seafood
might explain some of the beneficial effects of maternal seafood
consumption seen previously in ALSPAC, at least for fine-motor
skills at 30 months and social skills at 42 months(1). The classi-
fication of maternal seafood consumption by Hibbeln et al.(1)
included white fish and shellfish which are not good sources of
dietary vitamin D, therefore, we would not expect vitamin D
intake to account totally for their findings. Furthermore, our
results cannot explain previous associations found in ALSPAC
between maternal seafood consumption and IQ(1) or between
maternal iodine status and IQ and reading ability(22).
Our findings on fine- and gross-motor skills support previous
non-ALSPAC-based research that found a positive association
between maternal vitamin D status and infant psychomotor
development(11). Although we did not specifically measure
scholastic achievement, the lack of an association between

 maternal vitamin D status and either reading ability or IQ in our
study reinforces the findings of a previous study that found no
relationship between maternal 25(OH)D status and offspring
scholastic achievement(10). Although a US study found a
relationship between maternal vitamin D status and offspring
IQ, the effect estimates were very small and there was very little
indication of an association between maternal blood 25(OH)D
and
cognitive
development,
achievement
or
behaviour
between 8 months and 7 years of age(12).
Our findings suggest that some specific aspects of early
neurocognitive development may be suboptimal if maternal
prenatal vitamin D is deficient (i.e. serum 25(OH)D of
<50·0 nmol/l) in pregnancy. The biological mechanism under-
pinning this association in humans is not fully understood, but
the ubiquitous presence of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and
the hydroxylase enzymes controlling vitamin D metabolism in
a wide variety of areas of the human brain(6), as well as neu-
rological developmental mechanisms previously identified in
studies of vitamin D deficiency in pregnant rats may be
relevant(7,9,28,29).
These
include
enlarged
brain
ventricles,
thinner neocortex(29) and more mitotic cells in the brain(29),
suggesting a less differentiated phenotype(28). The active form
of vitamin D (1,25(OH)2D), may also affect the development of
the brain by influencing the production of cytokines(30),
affecting neurotransmission(31) and synaptic plasticity(31) which
is likely to affect learning processes(32) and therefore neuro-
cognitive development. 1,25(OH)2D likely affects dopamine
activity in the brain owing to the presence of the VDR in brain
areas responsive to dopamine(33). Ventral midbrain dopami-
nergic neurones are known to play a key role in the modulation
of motor behaviour(34). It is therefore feasible that 1,25(OH)2D
may affect motor development via its effects on the dopami-
nergic system. Other potential mechanisms may relate to an
association between maternal 25(OH)D status and fetal growth
retardation (e.g. reduced fetal head size) which is associated
with later developmental disabilities(35). A recent study in the
Generation R cohort in the Netherlands found an association
between lower maternal 25(OH)D status at 20 weeks gestation

ALSPAC, Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children; IQ, intelligence quotient.
* Suboptimal outcome defined as scores in the bottom quartile for ALSPAC pre-school development assessments, cognition and reading ability. Published cut-offs(17) were used for
behaviour: prosocial (≤5; 9·8 %), peer problems (≥3; 13·5 %), hyperactivity (≥6; 18·7 %), emotional symptoms (≥4; 12·2 %), conduct problems (≥3; 24·3 %) and total score
(≥14; 10·5 %). Maternal vitamin D status ≥50·0 nmol/l was the reference group and model 3 was used (without gestational week of vitamin D assessment as this was used
to split analyses).

Maternal vitamin D and offspring development

 and smaller fetal-head circumference in the third trimester(36),
suggesting that poorer maternal 25(OH)D status may predis-
pose children to developmental delay via effects on intra-
uterine growth restriction.
When we assessed the impact of gestational age on our
results for outcomes that were significantly associated with
vitamin D in the main analyses, we found that the effect sizes
were generally greater when vitamin D was measured in the
second half (>22 weeks) than in the first half (≤22 weeks) of
pregnancy. There is a small amount of evidence in rats that
reintroduction of vitamin D after birth, but before end of
weaning, can rescue normal brain development(28); that time
period corresponds to the third trimester in humans, suggesting
a potential crucial window for vitamin D in brain development.
However, all interpretations in our analysis of gestational timing
need to be interpreted in light of the fact that we only had one
measurement of maternal vitamin D status for each woman and
so we cannot draw clear conclusions on the effects of gesta-
tional timing of vitamin D deficiency. Furthermore, we cannot
be sure that our observed effects are confined to the gestational
week that the 25(OH)D measurement was made, as some
individuals may have persistent pattern of vitamin D status that
extends into later pregnancy or infancy.
When the women were split into three groups (serum
25(OH)D of <25·0, 25·0–49·9 and ≥50·0 nmol/l), adverse out-
comes were present in the offspring of mothers with insufficient
status (serum 25(OH)D < 50 nmol/l) as well as those with
severe deficiency (serum 25(OH)D < 25 nmol/l). However,
there was a trend to larger effect sizes in the more deficient
<25·0 nmol/l group than in the 25·0–49·9 nmol/l group; the
relatively small sample size in the <25·0 nmol/l group explains
the wider CI seen for this cut-off. The outcomes that were
significantly associated with vitamin D when women were
dichotomised on the basis of a cut-off of 50·0 nmol/l were not
significant when the cut-off was increased to 75·0 nmol/l. These
findings support a vitamin D status cut-off for optimal child
outcomes closer to 50·0 nmol/l than to 75·0 nmol/l.
As the women in the ALSPAC study were recruited over
20 years ago, we compared their vitamin D status with more
recent measurements in UK women to assess the current
relevance of our findings. As 25(OH)D status does not differ
between pregnant and non-pregnant women(15) we looked at
nationally representative data in UK women from the recent
National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS). In the latest
report (sampling 2008/2009–2011/2012), 21·7 % of women of
19–64 years had a plasma 25(OH)D concentration below
25 nmol/l(37), a higher percentage than the 4·4 % of women in
ALSPAC. Other studies(38,39), including those in pregnancy,
suggest that many UK women are vitamin D deficient.
Currently, the UK National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence recommends that pregnant women should take a
supplement of 10 µg of vitamin D per d(40). However use of
vitamin D supplements in pregnancy is low, with a recent
survey (2005–2009) finding that only 1·4 % of UK pregnant
women had taken a vitamin D supplement(41). Our findings
give further evidence that public-health campaigns should
address the vitamin D status of UK pregnant women, and
encourage compliance with the 10 µg/d recommendation(40).
Strengths and limitations
Although our study has several strengths, including the large
sample size, there are also limitations. First each woman had
only one measure of maternal vitamin D status in pregnancy
which may not have reflected status over the whole of preg-
nancy. In addition, the range of vitamin D status in the ALSPAC
women was limited, with approximately one-third (34·6 %)
having a 25(OH)D concentration less than 50·0 nmol/l and
only a small proportion having a 25(OH)D concentration
<25·0 nmol/l (4·4 %). Moreover, ALSPAC only has a relatively
small number of women from ethnic-minority backgrounds
(just 2 % of this study sample), who are known to be at parti-
cular risk of having low 25(OH)D concentrations(42), suggesting
that the results may differ in populations with a larger number
of ethnic-minority individuals. Finally, we were not able to
control for the association between infant vitamin D status and
neurocognitive function as we had no measures of vitamin D
status in infancy. Infant vitamin D status may partly explain
some of the association seen in this paper between maternal
vitamin D status and infant neurodevelopment.
In conclusion, we found that maternal vitamin D status in
pregnancy was associated with a number of adverse neuro-
cognitive developmental variables in early childhood, albeit
with a small, but nonetheless important, effect size. There is a
need for replication of this work in other settings to confirm
these results, but the public-health implications of these
findings are nevertheless potentially important. Further study is
now urgently required, particularly in population groups that are
more severely vitamin D deficient such as dark-skinned ethnic-
minority women(37) whose children may show a wider range and
greater severity of suboptimal neurocognitive outcomes.
