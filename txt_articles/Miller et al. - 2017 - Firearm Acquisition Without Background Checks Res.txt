 Firearm Acquisition Without Background Checks
Results of a National Survey
Matthew Miller, MD, ScD; Lisa Hepburn, PhD; and Deborah Azrael, PhD
Background: In 1994, 40% of U.S. gun owners who had re-
cently acquired a firearm did so without a background check. No
contemporary estimates exist.
Objective: To estimate the proportion of current U.S. gun own-
ers who acquired their most recent firearm without a back-
ground check, by time since and manner of acquisition, for the
nation as a whole and separately in states with and without leg-
islation regulating private sales.
Design: Probability-based online survey.
Setting: United States, 2015.
Participants: 1613 adult gun owners.
Measurements: Current gun owners were asked where and
when they acquired their last firearm; if they purchased the fire-
arm; and whether, as part of that acquisition, they had a back-
ground check (or were asked to show a firearm license or per-
mit).
Results: 22% (95% CI, 16% to 27%) of gun owners who reported
obtaining their most recent firearm within the previous 2 years
reported doing so without a background check. For firearms
purchased privately within the previous 2 years (that is, other
than from a store or pawnshop, including sales between individ-
uals in person, online, or at gun shows), 50% (CI, 35% to 65%)
were obtained without a background check. This percentage
was 26% (CI, 5% to 47%) for owners residing in states regulating
private firearm sales and 57% (CI, 40% to 75%) for those living in
states without regulations on private firearm sales.
Limitation: Potential inaccuracies due to recall and social desir-
ability bias.
Conclusion: 22% of current U.S. gun owners who acquired a
firearm within the past 2 years did so without a background
check. Although this represents a smaller proportion of gun
owners obtaining firearms without background checks than in
the past, millions of U.S. adults continue to acquire guns without
background checks, especially in states that do not regulate pri-
vate firearm sales.

U
niversal background checks are favored by more
than 90% of all Americans (1). Legislation requiring
background checks for private firearm sales has been
strongly endorsed by leading U.S. medical (2), legal (2),
and law enforcement organizations (3). Despite this
support, most states do not require background checks
for firearm sales between private parties. The extent to
which the absence of requirements for universal back-
ground checks contributes to the more than 33 000 an-
nual firearm deaths in the United States (4) is unknown,
in part because even the most basic information about
background checks is not routinely collected. For ex-
ample, no routinely collected data indicate how fre-
quently firearms are transferred from one private party
to another, where and between whom these transfers
occur, or how often they involve background checks.
What is known is that many gun offenders obtain the
guns they use in crime through private sales. For exam-
ple, a survey of prisoners convicted of gun offenses
revealed that 96% of inmates who were prohibited
from possessing a firearm at the time they committed
their crime had obtained their firearm from an unli-
censed private seller (5). Other studies identify unli-
censed private sellers as major contributors to illegal
firearm trafficking within the United States and across
the U.S.-Mexico border (6, 7).
Because routinely collected data do not provide
estimates of where firearms exchange hands after en-
tering the U.S. market, or the extent to which secondary
transfers are subject to background checks, research-
ers have relied on national surveys, the most recent of
which was a random-digit dialing survey conducted in
1994, to estimate the proportion of U.S. gun owners
who obtain firearms without a background check (8).
That survey asked gun-owning respondents whether
they had acquired firearms during the previous 2 years
and, if so, whether their most recent acquisition had
been "from a federally licensed firearms dealer" (the
proxy
used
for
having
undergone
a
background
check). As reported first by Cook and Ludwig (8), ap-
proximately 40% of gun-owning respondents who had
acquired firearms between 1992 and 1994 did so with-
out a background check. No contemporary estimates
exist.
We believe the current study is the first in more
than 20 years to update and extend information about
where, when, and how current U.S. gun owners ac-
quired their most recent firearm and whether the trans-
fer involved a background check. We enumerate the
proportion of current gun owners who acquired their
most recent firearm without undergoing a background
check by acquisition type (purchased vs. nonpur-
chased), subtype (where acquired, from whom), and re-
cency of acquisition. In addition, although federal law
does not require background checks for firearms trans-

METHODS
Design and Sampling
Data come from a nationally representative, Web-
based survey designed by the investigators and con-
ducted in April 2015 by the survey firm Growth for
Knowledge (GfK). Respondents were drawn from GfK'
s
KnowledgePanel (KP), a group of approximately 55 000
U.S. adults selected (on an ongoing basis) with an
equal probability of selection. The study-specific re-
cruitment rate (proportion of individuals who were eli-
gible for our study and agreed to become panel mem-
bers) was 14.4%. All panel members, except those
currently serving in the U.S. Armed Forces, were eligi-
ble to participate. Gun owners and veterans were over-
sampled from the KP; sampling weights supplied by
GfK were applied such that estimates from the survey
are representative of U.S. adults (aged ≥ 18 years) in
2015. Invitations to participate were e-mailed; 1 re-
minder e-mail was sent to nonresponders 3 days later.
Participants did not receive any specific incentive to
complete this survey, although GfK has a point-based
program through which participants accrue points for
completing surveys and can redeem them later for
cash, merchandise, or participation in sweepstakes. Ad-
ditional details of GfK'
s survey design are described in
the Appendix (available at Annals.org).
The Northeastern University Institutional Review
Board approved the study.
Measures
The full survey, conducted in April 2015, was de-
signed to examine patterns of civilian gun ownership,
storage, and use. It determined gun ownership status
and whether the owner'
s most recently acquired fire-
arm was obtained with a background check but did not
ask about the timing of the most recent acquisition. To
determine when, relative to the original survey, respon-
dents acquired their most recent firearm, GfK invited all
gun-owning respondents from the April 2015 survey to
answer additional questions in November 2015 (Fig-
ure).
Gun ownership status was determined on the basis
of responses to 2 questions, the first being, "Do you or
does anyone else you live with currently own any type
of gun?" Those who answered affirmatively then were
asked, "Do you personally own a gun?" Respondents
also were asked about their most recent firearm acqui-
sition, including the type of gun (for example, handgun
or long gun), whether they bought the gun or acquired
it in some other way (such as through an inheritance),
and where they acquired the firearm (for example, a
gun store). Data regarding background checks are only
from respondents who personally owned guns.
To determine what proportion of current firearm
owners underwent a background check for their most
recently acquired firearm, we asked all gun owners, "As
far as you know, as part of the transfer, did you un-
dergo a background check?" All gun owners also were
asked, "Did the person who sold you a gun ask you to
show a firearm license or permit before buying the
gun?" Respondents could answer "yes," "no," or "no
opinion/don'
t know" to both questions. If the response
to either question was affirmative, we classified that
transfer as having involved a background check. Re-
spondents who answered "no opinion/don'
t know" to
the background check question were included in pri-
mary analyses after imputation (described later).
In the supplemental November 2015 survey, all
gun owners from the original survey still in the KP were
invited to answer 2 additional questions about the tim-
ing of their most recent gun acquisition. The first ques-
tion was, "When you completed the prior national fire-
arms survey, sponsored by Northeastern University, in
April 2015, you said that the gun you acquired most
recently was a [insert type based on type noted in the
April 2015 survey]. Thinking about this gun, approxi-
mately when did you acquire it?" Three options were
offered: "within the past 2 years," "between 2 and 5
years ago," and "more than 5 years ago." The second

 question was, "What was the exact year that you ac-
quired this gun?" Respondents were asked to specify
the exact year or to report that they did not know the
year.
State Firearm Legislation
State laws regulating private firearm sales generally
require that before a purchased firearm can be trans-
ferred between private parties, the prospective pur-
chaser undergo (and pass) a criminal history back-
ground check. For the state-level analyses, if a state had
implemented a private sales law by 1 July 2013, it was
coded as having such a law for the analyses involving
firearms acquired within the past 2 years. Washington
and Oregon both enacted laws in the latter part of
2014 and therefore were coded as not having a back-
ground check law (10). For the analyses involving fire-
arms acquired more than 2 years before the survey ad-
ministration, Colorado and Delaware were coded as
not having state laws because they implemented laws
after 1 July 2013 (10). We assumed that the state in
which each respondent was living at the time of the
survey was the state in which he or she had acquired his
or her most recent firearm. Firearm purchases made
between individuals, at a gun show, or online were
coded as private sales, but those that occurred at
stores or pawnshops, which by federal law are required
to be licensed as firearm dealers, were not.
States with laws regulating private sales as of 1 July
2013 include California, Colorado, Connecticut, Dela-
ware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, Penn-
sylvania, Rhode Island, and Washington, DC. Except for
Colorado, which enacted its law in 2013, and Delaware,
which in 2013 converted its law from optional to man-
datory, other states that regulate private sales enacted
their laws before 1996 (Table 1). All states with private-
sales legislation regulate handgun sales; 11 regulate
long-gun sales (long guns include rifles and shotguns)
(10).
Weighting and Analysis
To ensure reliable estimates at the national level,
our survey oversampled gun owners by using GfK de-
mographic profile variables, then used the gun-owning
questions in the April 2015 survey to verify gun owner-
ship. The GfK group provided final survey weights that
combined presample and study-specific poststratifica-
tion weights to account for oversampling and for non-
response to both the April 2015 and November 2015
surveys. Additional details about survey weighting are
available in the Appendix.
Regarding the background check question, 148 re-
spondents (23 of whom acquired their most recent fire-
arm within 2 years of the survey) answered "no opinion/
don'
t know." We did not believe these responses
represented an informative outcome; therefore, in pri-
mary analyses, we used multiple imputation to account
for these "missing" responses for our outcome of inter-
est. Multiple imputation for missing values was done by
using logistic regression under the missing-at-random
assumption. The imputation model included predictors
of background check status: place and type of firearm
transfer; timing of transfer; residence in a state with
laws regulating private sales; and additional covariates
of age, sex, educational attainment, ethnicity, marital
status, urban or rural residence, and veteran status. We
generated 100 multiply imputed data sets, and esti-
mates were derived in Stata, version 14 (StataCorp), by
using the "mi" and "svy" suite of commands. An addi-
tional 15 respondents did not know when they ac-
quired their firearm and were excluded from analyses
that involved acquisition timing but included in the
overall acquisition numbers. All analyses used weight-
ing commands (using the weight variable provided
by GfK) to generate national estimates reported as

* State laws vary in terms of what types of firearms transfers are subject to background checks. In 11 states and the District of Columbia, the laws
apply to all firearms; in 6 states, the laws apply only to handguns. Maryland requires background checks for handguns and assault rifles. Many of
these laws exclude direct transfers among immediate family members.

 weighted percentages, with 95% CIs, following the
STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational
Studies in Epidemiology) guidelines for reporting (11).
We conducted sensitivity analyses to examine how
our estimate of the proportion of gun owners who ac-
quired their most recent firearm without a background
check varied depending on how we handled respon-
dents who answered "no opinion/don'
t know" to the
background check question. First, we categorized all
such respondents (n = 148) as having undergone a
background
check
(effectively
producing
a
lower
bound for our estimates of what percentage of gun
owners did not have a background check). Next, we
categorized all 148 respondents as not having under-
gone
a
background
check
(producing
an
upper
bound). We conducted 2 additional sensitivity analyses
pertaining to respondents who acquired their most re-
cent firearm in 2013, because asking respondents to
indicate whether they had acquired their most recent
firearm "within the past 2 years" versus "between 2 and
5 years ago" may have introduced ambiguity for those
who acquired their most recent firearm in 2013. The
first excluded the 134 respondents who acquired their
most recent firearm in 2013 from the "within the past 2
years" group; the second included all 134 in the "within
the past 2 years" group.

RESULTS
Of the 7318 invited panel members, 4165 started
and 3949 completed the April 2015 survey (excluding
48 active-duty military personnel who started the sur-
vey but were ineligible to complete it), yielding a survey
completion rate of 54.6% (12). Of the 2072 gun-owning
respondents in the original April 2015 survey, 1880
were still in the KP in November; all were invited to
answer the additional set of questions about the timing
of their most recent gun acquisition. Of the 1880, 1613
(86%) responded. Respondents to the supplemental
survey did not differ from the participants in the origi-
nal survey with respect to age, sex, race, type of gun
most recently acquired, acquisition patterns, or propor-
tion who reported having a background check.
Half of our respondents acquired their most recent
gun within the past 5 years (29% within the past 2 years,
21% between 2 and 5 years ago, and the remainder
more than 5 years ago) (Table 2). For gun owners who
reported acquiring their last firearm within 2 years of
the April survey, 22% (95% CI, 16% to 27%) obtained
their most recent gun without a background check (Ta-
ble 3). Sensitivity analyses excluding the 134 respon-
dents who acquired their most recent firearm in 2013,
79 of whom indicated they had acquired their most re-
cent firearm within 2 years of the survey, yielded similar
results: 20% (CI, 14% to 26%). Analyses including all

 134 respondents who indicated that they had obtained
their last firearm in 2013 or thereafter likewise yielded
similar results: 23% (CI, 18% to 29%).
Among gun owners who acquired their most re-
cent firearm within the past 2 years by way of purchase,
13% (CI, 8% to 18%) did so without a background
check. For gun owners who purchased their most re-
cent gun from a friend or an acquaintance within the
past 2 years, 77% (CI, 62% to 92%) did so without a
background check. For those purchasing online, 45%
(CI, 9% to 82%) did not have a background check.
Among gun owners overall, regardless of when their
most recent acquisition occurred, 70% purchased their
most recent firearm, and 27% of the latter group (CI,
23% to 30%) did so without a background check. Over-
all, across all periods, 42% (CI, 38% to 45%) acquired
their most recent firearm without a background check.
When respondents who answered "no opinion/
don'
t know" were assumed either to have or to have
not undergone a background check, resulting point es-
timates fell within the 95% CIs of our primary analyses.
For example, with respect to firearm transfers within 2
years of the survey, the lower and upper bounds for
point estimates produced by coding missing data in
this manner were 18% and 26%, respectively.
For firearms purchased privately within the past 2
years, 50% (CI, 35% to 65%) were obtained without a
background check. Among gun owners who reported
obtaining their most recent firearm within the past 2
years by way of purchase from a private seller, those
who lived in states regulating private firearm sales re-
ported doing so without a background check 26% (CI,
5% to 47%) of the time. Among respondents residing in
states without regulations on private firearm sales, 57%
(CI, 40% to 75%) of such transfers occurred without
background checks (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
The number of new guns available for purchase by
the U.S. civilian population, all of which are subject to
background checks when first acquired, is published
annually by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms
and Explosives (ATF). The ATF data indicate that more
than 360 million firearms entered the U.S. market be-
tween 1899 and 2013, with 16 million entering in 2013
alone (13). These data, however, do not explain how
many of the 55 million U.S. adults who currently own
firearms (9) obtained their guns without background
checks.
Our finding that 22% (CI, 16% to 27%) of gun own-
ers who recently acquired firearms did so without a
background check is lower than the 1994 estimate of
"about" 40% (8), which was based on a survey with
2568 respondents (789 gun owners, 251 of whom ac-
quired a firearm within 2 years of the survey) and a
1.4% margin of error for the full sample. No CIs around
the 40% statistic were reported. The apparent decline

 in firearm acquisition without background checks over
the past 2 decades, based on comparing our findings
with those from the 1994 survey, cannot be attributed
to differences in the period assessed (both surveys fo-
cused on the 2 years before the survey). Our survey
asked respondents explicitly about background checks
and permits or licenses to purchase, and the 1994 sur-
vey asked respondents whether their last acquisition
was through a federally licensed firearms dealer. How-
ever, the differences in how the 2 surveys assessed
background check status also seem unlikely to explain
the apparent decline in the proportion of gun owners
who reported not having undergone a background
check for recent acquisitions. In the 1994 survey, for
example, some respondents were not sure whether the
source was a federally licensed firearms dealer, and
others indicated that the source was a federally li-
censed firearms dealer but then reported that the
transaction was a trade rather than a cash sale or that
the source was an acquaintance or a family member (8).
Regardless of which of these cases were included or
excluded, the proportion without a background check
ranged from 36% to 43%. Likewise, sensitivity analyses
in our survey produced similar estimates regardless of
whether we imputed background check status for re-
spondents who indicted "no opinion/don'
t know" to
the background check question, as in our primary anal-
yses, or eliminated these respondents from analyses al-
together. Even when we generated upper and lower
bounds for our point estimates by assigning all such
respondents to either having had or not having had a
background check, estimates of the proportion of gun
owners who did not have a background check ranged
only from 18% to 26%. Lastly, results within our 2015
survey are consistent with a decline since 1994: 31%
(CI, 25% to 34%) of current gun owners who obtained
their last firearm between 2 and 5 years before our sur-
vey and 57% (CI, 53% to 62%) whose last acquisition
was more than 5 years before our survey reported com-
pleting the transaction without a background check.
One reason background checks have become
more common in recent years is that compared with
gun owners who acquired their most recent firearm
several years ago, those who acquired a gun more re-
cently are more likely to have purchased their firearm
from a store (where background checks are required
by federal law), as Table 2 indicates. Another factor
may be that several states have enacted background
check regulations for the private sale of firearms. Con-
sistent with the goals of these state-level regulations,
we found that 26% (CI, 5% to 47%) of gun owners who
lived in a state regulating private sales and who pur-
chased firearms from a private seller in the past 2 years
did so without a background check, compared with
57% (CI, 40% to 75%) of those who lived in states that
adhered to federal requirements alone.
As with findings from all self-reported surveys, our
study'
s results should be interpreted in light of poten-
tial inaccuracies due to recall and social desirability bias
(14), especially for respondent answers that relate to
more remote periods. In addition, firearm owners may
have acquired their gun in a state with private-sale laws
that differ from those of the state in which they resided
at the time of the survey. For these reasons, we empha-
size our findings related to firearm acquisitions within 2
years of our survey. With respect to potential inaccura-
cies due to recall and social desirability bias, research
suggests that online panel surveys, such as ours, may
reduce social desirability bias and yield more accurate
estimates of respondent characteristics compared with
telephone surveys (15, 16). Another advantage of on-
line panels is high completion rates for those who be-
gin the survey and the availability of information about
panelists who do not elect to take the survey in the first
place (12). In our study, 99% of respondents completed
the survey, fewer than 1% declined to answer our stem
question about household gun ownership, no one de-
clined to answer the subsequent question regarding
whether they personally owned a gun, and fewer than
2% declined to answer the background check ques-
tions. Finally, our survey completion rate (55%) is
higher than the rates for typical nonprobability, opt-in,
online surveys, which are 2% to 16% (12); higher than
those of previous national injury surveys that included
questions about firearm ownership (17, 18); and similar
to those from other surveys conducted by GfK (19).
Nevertheless, panel members who chose not to partic-
ipate in our survey may have differed in important ways
related to the likelihood of undergoing background
checks compared with panel members who chose to
participate.
In 2015, 8 national health professional organiza-
tions and the American Bar Association called for leg-
islation requiring background checks for all firearm
sales between private parties (2). In providing empirical
context, the alliance estimated that 6.6 million firearms
are sold annually without background checks, an ex-
trapolation based on the most recent data available:
the 1994 National Survey on Private Ownership and
Use of Firearms, which found that approximately 40%
of gun owners who had recently acquired a firearm did
so without a background check (8). Although our esti-
mate suggests that a smaller proportion of gun owners
(22%) obtain firearms without background checks to-
day than in the past, our findings nevertheless indicate
that millions of U.S. adults annually continue to acquire
guns without background checks, often from friends or
acquaintances, and disproportionately so in states that
do not regulate private firearm sales.

APPENDIX: DETAILED SURVEY METHODS
Study Design
Northeastern University (principal investigator, M.
Miller) contracted GfK (formerly Knowledge Networks;
www.gfk.com) to conduct the National Firearms Survey,
which aimed to examine firearm ownership and use in
the United States. The survey was done in a sample
from KP, an online research panel that represents the
entire U.S. population.
KP Details
Panel members are recruited by GfK randomly
through probability-based sampling, and households
are provided with access to the Internet and hardware
if needed. For recruiting, GfK uses address-based sam-
pling methods (previously it relied on random-digit di-
aling methods). After accepting the invitation to join
the panel, participants are asked to complete a short
demographic survey (the initial profile survey), answers
to which allow efficient panel sampling and weighting
for future surveys. Completion of the profile survey al-
lows participants to become panel members, and as in
the past, all respondents are given the same privacy
terms and confidentiality protections. For our survey,
the profile rate was 63.8%, defined as ((Profile Com-
pletes))/((Profile Complete+Partial Profile Complete)+
(Profile
Refusals+Profile
Noncontacts+Other
Profile
Cases)).
Once household members are recruited for the
panel and assigned to a study sample, they are notified
by e-mail for survey taking, or panelists may visit their
online member page to take the survey (instead of be-
ing contacted by telephone or postal mail). The latter
approach reduces the burden placed on respondents
because e-mail notification is less intrusive than tele-
phone calls, and most respondents find answering
Web questionnaires more interesting and engaging
than being questioned by a telephone interviewer. Fur-
thermore, respondents have the convenience of choos-
ing what time of day to complete their assigned survey.
To assist panel members with their survey taking, each
member has a personalized "home page" listing all the
surveys that have been assigned to him or her and have
yet to be completed.

Sampling
The parent survey used for this study was con-
ducted in a target population comprising adults aged
18 years or older who fell into 1 of 3 groups: gun own-
ers, non-gun owners living in a gun-owning household,
or non-gun owners living in a non-gun-owning house-
hold. An additional target population was veterans
(who could fall into any of the 3 aforementioned
groups). To sample this population, GfK targeted re-
spondents in its master panel who met our study crite-
ria and reconfirmed their gun ownership and veteran
status in the study-specific survey.
The study-specific survey had 3 stages: initial
screening for gun ownership and veteran status, the
main survey conducted in April 2015 that included
study-eligible respondents (gun owners and non-gun
owners), and a 7-question supplemental survey in No-
vember 2015 targeting all gun owners identified in the
April survey (pertinent to this study, questions related
to the timing of their last firearm acquisition; an addi-
tional 2 questions concerned firearm theft). To qualify
for the main survey, a panel member must have been
aged 18 years or older and was not currently serving on
active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces.
Data Collection
Survey pretesting occurred in March 2015, with ad-
ministration of the final survey in April 2015. Potentially
eligible panel members received an e-mail notifying
them that a new survey was available for them to take.
The e-mail contained a direct link to the survey ques-
tionnaire; no login name or password was required.
After 3 days, automatic e-mail reminders were sent to
all nonresponding panel members in the sample. Par-
ticipants completed the main survey in a median of 14
minutes.
The goal of GfK in structuring recruitment for the
KP is a group that represents the U.S. adult population
with respect to a broad set of geodemographic distri-
butions as well as subgroups of hard-to-reach adults

 (for example, those without a landline telephone or
those who primarily speak Spanish). In selecting gen-
eral population samples from the KP, GfK uses an equal
probability of selection design by weighting the entire
KP to the benchmarks from the latest March supple-
ment of the U.S. Census Bureau'
s Current Population
Survey
(www.census.gov/cps/data/).
The
geodemo-
graphic dimensions used for weighting the entire KP
typically include sex, age, race, ethnicity, education,
census region, household income, home ownership
status, metropolitan area, and Internet access. With
these weights as the measure of size for each panel
member, a probability proportional to size is used in
the next step to select study-specific samples. Applica-
tion of the proportional-to-size methodology with the
aforementioned measure of size values produces fully
self-weighing KP samples, for which each sample mem-
ber can carry a design weight of unity.
Study-Specific Poststratification Weights
Once the study sample was selected and fielded
and all the survey data were edited and made final,
design weights were adjusted for any survey nonre-
sponse (to the initial and to the supplemental survey) as
well as any under- or overcoverage imposed by the
study-specific sample design. For this study, the follow-
ing strata of gun ownership from weighted KP data and
veteran status from the 2014 veteran supplemental sur-
vey of the Current Population Survey were used for the
raking adjustment of weights:
Sex, by age (18 to 29, 30 to 44, 45 to 59, 60 to 69,
or =70 years)
Census region (Northeast, Midwest, South, West),
by metropolitan area (yes or no)
Sex, by veteran status (yes or no)
Age (18 to 29, 30 to 44, 45 to 59, 60 to 69, or =70
years), by veteran status (yes or no)
Race/Hispanic ethnicity (white/non-Hispanic, black/
Non-Hispanic, other/Non-Hispanic, =2 races/Non-His-
panic, Hispanic), by veteran status (yes or no)
Census region (Northeast, Midwest, South, West),
by veteran status (yes or no)
Metropolitan area (yes or no), by veteran status (yes
or no)
Education (less than high school/high school, some
college, bachelor or greater), by veteran status (yes or
no)
Householdincome(<$25 000,$25 000to<$50 000,
$50 000 to <$75 000, =$75 000 per year), by veteran
status (yes or no)
Internet access (yes or no), by veteran status (yes or
no)
Veteran serving years (<2, 2 to 3, 4 to 9, or =10
years)
Armed services branch (Air Force, Army, Coast
Guard/Marines/other, Navy)
Iterative
proportional
fitting
(raking)
was
per-
formed to produce final weights aligned with respect to
all strata simultaneously. In the final step, calculated
weights were examined to identify and, if necessary,
trim outliers at the extreme upper and lower tails of the
weight distribution. The resulting weights then were
scaled to the sum of the total sample size of all eligible
respondents.
We report the study "completion rate" for our
survey on the basis of the formula developed by Calle-
garo and DiSogra (12) for response rates calculated ap-
plicable to Web panels. The study completion rate =
((Study Completes))/((Study Completes+Study Partial
Completes)+(Study Refusals+Study Noncontacts+Other
Study Cases)).
