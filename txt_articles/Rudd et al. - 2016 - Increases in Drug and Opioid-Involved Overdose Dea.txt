 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report
MMWR / December 30, 2016 / Vol. 65 / Nos. 50 & 51

US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
On December 16, this report was posted as an MMWR Early 
Release on the MMWR website (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr). 
The U.S. opioid epidemic is continuing, and drug overdose 
deaths nearly tripled during 1999–2014. Among 47,055 drug 
overdose deaths that occurred in 2014 in the United States, 
28,647 (60.9%) involved an opioid (1). Illicit opioids are 
contributing to the increase in opioid overdose deaths (2,3). In 
an effort to target prevention strategies to address the rapidly 
changing epidemic, CDC examined overall drug overdose 
death rates during 2010–2015 and opioid overdose death rates 
during 2014–2015 by subcategories (natural/semisynthetic 
opioids, methadone, heroin, and synthetic opioids other than 
methadone).* Rates were stratified by demographics, region, 
and by 28 states with high quality reporting on death certifi-
cates of specific drugs involved in overdose deaths. During 
2015, drug overdoses accounted for 52,404 U.S. deaths, 
including 33,091 (63.1%) that involved an opioid. There has 
been progress in preventing methadone deaths, and death rates 
declined by 9.1%. However, rates of deaths involving other 
opioids, specifically heroin and synthetic opioids other than 
methadone (likely driven primarily by illicitly manufactured 
fentanyl) (2,3), increased sharply overall and across many states. 
A multifaceted, collaborative public health and law enforce-
ment approach is urgently needed. Response efforts include 
implementing the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for 
Chronic Pain (4), improving access to and use of prescription 
drug monitoring programs, enhancing naloxone distribution 
and other harm reduction approaches, increasing opioid use 
disorder treatment capacity, improving linkage into treatment, 
and supporting law enforcement strategies to reduce the illicit 
opioid supply.
The National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death 
mortality files were used to record drug overdose deaths.† 
Drug overdose deaths were identified using the International 
Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), based on 
the ICD-10 underlying cause-of-death codes X40–44 (unin-
tentional), X60–64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10–Y14 
(undetermined intent). Among deaths with drug overdose as 
the underlying cause, the type of opioid is indicated by the fol-
lowing ICD-10 multiple cause-of-death codes: opioids (T40.0, 
T40.1, T40.2, T40.3, T40.4, or T40.6); natural/semisynthetic 
opioids (T40.2); methadone (T40.3); synthetic opioids other 
than methadone (T40.4); and heroin (T40.1). Some deaths 
involved more than one type of opioid; these deaths were 
included in the rates for each subcategory. Therefore, categories 
of deaths presented are not mutually exclusive.§
Changes in drug overdose death rates were analyzed for all 50 
states and the District of Columbia (DC) from 2010 to 2015 
using joinpoint regression.¶ Opioid overdose death rates were 
examined for the period 2014–2015 by subcategories (natural/
semisynthetic opioids, methadone, heroin, and synthetic opi-
oids other than methadone) and by demographics, region, and 
across states. State-level analyses were conducted for 28 states 
meeting the following criteria: 1) >80% of drug overdose death 
certificates named at least one specific drug in 2014; 2) change 
from 2014 to 2015 in the percentage of death certificates report-
ing at least one specific drug was <10 percentage points**; and 
3) ≥20 deaths occurred during 2014 and 2015 in at least two 
opioid subcategories examined. Analyses comparing changes in 
age-adjusted death rates from 2014 to 2015 used z-tests when 
deaths were ≥100 and nonoverlapping confidence intervals based 
on a gamma distribution when deaths were <100.††
The drug overdose death rate increased significantly from 
12.3 per 100,000 population in 2010 to 16.3 in 2015. Death 
rates increased in 30 states and DC and remained stable in 
19 states (Figure). Two states had changing trends during this 
period of decreasing rates followed by increases.§§ During 
2015, a total of 52,404 persons in the United States died from

* Natural opioids include morphine and codeine, and semisynthetic opioids 
include drugs such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, and 
oxymorphone. Methadone is a synthetic opioid. Synthetic opioids, other than 
methadone, include drugs such as tramadol and fentanyl. Heroin is an illicit 
opioid synthesized from morphine that can be a white or brown powder, or a 
black sticky substance.
† https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/mortality_public_use_data.htm.
 § For example, a death involving both a synthetic opioid other than methadone 
and heroin would be included in both the “synthetic other than methadone” 
and heroin death rates.
 ¶ For all analyses, a p-value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. 
https://surveillance.cancer.gov/joinpoint/.
 
** States whose reporting of any specific drug or drugs involved in an overdose 
changed by ≥10 percentage points from 2014 to 2015 were excluded, because 
drug-specific overdose numbers and rates might change substantially from 
2014 to 2015 because of changes in reporting.
 
†† Age-adjusted death rates were calculated by applying age-specific death rates 
to the 2000 U.S. Census standard population age distribution https://www.
cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr61/nvsr61_04.pdf. For z-tests, a p-value of <0.05 
was considered to be statistically significant.
 
§§ Florida and South Carolina, had both decreasing and increasing trends during 
this period. In Florida, rates decreased from 2010 to 2013, then increased to 2015; 
in South Carolina, rates decreased from 2010 to 2012, then increased to 2015.

a drug overdose, an increase from 47,055 in 2014; among 
these deaths, 33,091 (63.1%) involved an opioid, an increase 
from 28,647 in 2014. The age-adjusted opioid-involved death 
rate increased by 15.6%, from 9.0 per 100,000 in 2014 to 
10.4 in 2015, driven largely by increases in deaths involving 
heroin and synthetic opioids other than methadone. Death 
rates for natural/semisynthetic opioids, heroin, and synthetic 
opioids other than methadone increased by 2.6%, 20.6%, and 
72.2%, respectively (Table 1) (Table 2). Methadone death rates 
decreased by 9.1% (Table 1).
During 2014–2015, rates of natural/semisynthetic opi-
oid deaths increased among males overall, both sexes aged 
25–44 years, and non-Hispanic whites. Methadone death rates 
decreased among males and females overall, but increased among 
persons aged ≥65 years (Table 1). Death rates involving heroin 
and synthetic opioids other than methadone increased in both 
males and females, persons aged ≥15 years, and all racial/ethnic 
populations; however, heroin death rates among males aged 
15–24 years remained stable. In 2015, death rates involving 
synthetic opioids other than methadone were highest among 
males aged 25–44 years (8.9 per 100,000), increasing 102.3% 
from 2014 to 2015 (Table 2). Heroin death rates also were 
highest in this demographic group (13.2), increasing 22.2% 
from 2014 to 2015. Natural/semisynthetic opioid death rates 
increased in the Northeast and South U.S. Census regions, and 
methadone death rates decreased in the South (Table 1). Death 
rates involving synthetic opioids other than methadone and 
heroin increased in all regions from 2014 to 2015 (Table 2).
Among the 28 states meeting inclusion criteria for state-
level analyses, 16 (57.1%) experienced increases in death 
rates involving synthetic opioids other than methadone, and 
11 (39.3%) experienced increases in heroin death rates from 
2014 to 2015. The largest absolute rate change in deaths 
from synthetic opioids other than methadone occurred in 
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Ohio, Rhode Island and West 
Virginia. The largest percentage increases in rates occurred 
in New York (135.7%), Connecticut (125.9%) and Illinois 
(120%) (Table 2). Connecticut, Massachusetts, Ohio, and 
West Virginia experienced the largest absolute rate changes in 
heroin deaths, while the largest percentage increases in rates 
occurred in South Carolina (57.1%), North Carolina (46.4%), 
and Tennessee (43.5) (Table 2). Three states (New Mexico, 
Oklahoma, and Virginia) experienced decreases in natural/
semi-synthetic opioid death rates, while increases occurred in 
five states (Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, 
and Tennessee) (Table 1).
Discussion
During 2010–2015, the rate of drug overdose deaths in 
the United States increased in 30 states and DC, remained 
stable in 19 states, and showed decreasing trends followed by 
increases in two states.§§,¶¶ From 2014 to 2015, drug overdose 
deaths increased by 5,349 (11.4%), signifying a continuing 
trend observed since 1999 (1). Opioid death rates increased by 
15.6% from 2014 to 2015. These significant increases in death 
rates were driven by synthetic opioids other than methadone 
(72.2%), most likely illicitly-manufactured fentanyl (2,3), 
and heroin (20.6%). Increases in these opioid subcategories 
occurred overall and across all demographics and regions. 
Natural/semisynthetic opioid death rates increased by 2.6%, 
whereas methadone death rates decreased by 9.1%.
These findings are consistent with recent reports highlighting 
the increasing trend in deaths involving heroin and synthetic 
opioids other than methadone (1–3,5). The number of deaths 
involving synthetic opioids other than methadone have been 
associated with the number of drug products obtained by law 
enforcement testing positive for fentanyl, but not with fen-
tanyl prescribing rates (2,3). A recent report found that these 
increases, likely attributable to illicitly manufactured fentanyl, 
were concentrated in eight of 27 states examined (2).
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
The U.S. opioid epidemic is continuing. Drug overdose deaths 
nearly tripled during 1999–2014. In 2014, among 47,055 drug 
overdose deaths, 61% involved an opioid. During 2013–2014, 
deaths associated with the most commonly prescribed opioids 
(natural/semisynthetic opioids) continued to increase slightly; 
however, the rapid increase in deaths appears to be driven by 
heroin and synthetic opioids other than methadone.
What is added by this report?
From 2014 to 2015, the death rate from synthetic opioids other 
than methadone, which includes fentanyl, increased by 72.2%, 
and heroin death rates increased by 20.6%. Rates of death 
involving heroin and synthetic opioids other than methadone 
increased across all demographic groups, regions, and in 
numerous states. Natural/semisynthetic opioid death rates 
increased by 2.6%, whereas, methadone death rates decreased 
by 9.1%.
What are the implications for public health practice?
There is an urgent need for a multifaceted, collaborative public 
health and law enforcement approach to the opioid epidemic, 
including implementing the CDC Guideline for Prescribing 
Opioids for Chronic Pain; improving access to and use of 
prescription drug monitoring programs; expanding naloxone 
distribution; enhancing opioid use disorder treatment capacity 
and linkage into treatment, including medication-assisted 
treatment; implementing harm reduction approaches, such as 
syringe services program; and supporting law enforcement 
strategies to reduce the illicit opioid supply.

The decline in methadone death rates, a trend observed 
since 2008, followed efforts to reduce methadone use for pain, 
including Food and Drug Administration warnings, limits on 
high dose formulations, and clinical guidelines (6). The small 
increase in natural/semisynthetic opioid death rates illustrates 
an ongoing problem with prescription opioids; however, the 
increase has slowed from 2013–2014, potentially because of 
policy and health system changes, required prescription drug 
monitoring program review, legislative changes in naloxone 
distribution, and prescribing guidelines (7,8).***
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita-
tions. First, factors related to death investigation might affect 
rate estimates involving specific drugs. At autopsy, the sub-
stances tested for, and circumstances under which tests are 
performed to determine which drugs are present, might vary 
by jurisdiction and over time. Second, the percentage of deaths 
with specific drugs identified on the death certificate varies by 
jurisdiction and over time. Nationally, 19% (in 2014) and 17% 
(in 2015) of drug overdose death certificates did not include the 
specific types of drugs involved. Additionally, the percentage 
of drug overdose deaths with specific drugs identified on the 
death certificate varies widely by state, ranging from 47.4% to 
99%. Variations in reporting across states prevent comparison 
of rates between states. Third, improvements in testing and 
reporting of specific drugs might have contributed to some 
observed increases in opioid-involved death rates. Fourth, 
because heroin and morphine are metabolized similarly (9), 
some heroin deaths might have been misclassified as morphine 
deaths, resulting in underreporting of heroin deaths. Finally,

 * Rates are for the number of deaths per 100,000 population. Age-adjusted death rates were calculated using the direct method and the 2000 standard population. 
Deaths were classified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD–10). Drug overdose deaths were identified using underlying cause-of-
death codes X40–X44, X60–X64, X85, and Y10–Y14.
 † Drug overdose deaths, as defined, that have natural and semisynthetic opioids (T40.2) as contributing causes.
 § Drug overdose deaths, as defined, that have methadone (T40.3) as a contributing cause.
 ¶ Categories of deaths are not exclusive because deaths might involve more than one drug. Summing categories will result in a number greater than the total number 
of deaths in a year.
 ** Data for Hispanic ethnicity should be interpreted with caution; studies comparing Hispanic ethnicity on death certificates and on census surveys have shown 
inconsistent reporting.
 †† Analyses were limited to states meeting the following criteria. For states with very good to excellent reporting, ≥90% of drug overdose death certificates mention 
at least one specific drug in 2014, with the change in percentage of drug overdose deaths mentioning at least one specific drug differing by <10 percentage points 
from 2014 to 2015. States with good reporting had 80% to <90% of drug overdose death certificates mention at least one specific drug in 2014, with the change 
in the percentage of drug overdose deaths mentioning at least one specific drug differing by <10 percentage points from 2014 to 2015. Rate comparisons between 
states should not be made because of variations in reporting across states.
 
§§ Statistically significant at p<0.05 level. Gamma tests were used if the number of deaths was <100 in 2014 or 2015, and z-tests were used if the number of deaths 
was ≥100 in both 2014 and 2015.
 
¶¶ Cells with nine or fewer deaths are not reported, and rates based on <20 deaths are not considered reliable and not reported.

the state-specific analyses of opioid deaths are restricted to 28 
states, limiting generalizability.
The ongoing epidemic of opioid deaths requires intense 
attention and action. In a November 2016 report, the Drug 
Enforcement Administration referred to prescription drugs, her-
oin, and fentanyl as the most significant drug-related threats to the 
United States.††† The misuse of prescription opioids is intertwined 
with that of illicit opioids; data have demonstrated that nonmedi-
cal use of prescription opioids is a significant risk factor for heroin 
use (10), underscoring the need for continued prevention efforts 
around prescription opioids. Intensifying efforts to distribute 
naloxone (an antidote to reverse an opioid overdose), enhancing 
access to treatment, including medication-assisted treatment, 
and implementing harm reduction services are urgently needed. 
It is important to focus efforts on expanding opioid disorder 
treatment capacity, including medication-assisted treatment and 
improving linkage into treatment.§§§ Implementing harm reduc-
tion approaches, such as the scaling up comprehensive syringe 
services programs can reach persons with opioid use disorders and 
provide them with access to naloxone and medication-assisted 
treatment, reduce transmission risk for human immunodeficiency 
virus or hepatitis C, and reduce other harms from drug use. Law 
enforcement strategies to reduce the illicit opioid supply must also 
be supported. A recent report did not find evidence that efforts 
to reduce opioid prescribing were leading to heroin overdoses; 
rather, such policies could help reduce the number of persons 
who are exposed to opioids (7). Continued improvements in 
guideline-recommended opioid prescribing practices for chronic 
pain (4), increased improving access to and use of prescription 
drug monitoring programs, and increased utilization of nonopioid 
pain treatments are needed. A multifaceted, coordinated approach 
between public health and public safety is also necessary to address 
the U.S. opioid epidemic.
