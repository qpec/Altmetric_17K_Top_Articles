Pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV infection and
new sexually transmitted infections among men
who have sex with men
Noah Kojimaa, Dvora Joseph Daveya,b and Jeffrey D.

We conducted a meta-analysis to summarize rates
of sexually transmitted infections among men
who have sex with men (MSM) on pre-exposure
prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV versus MSM not using
PrEP
. Incidence rate ratios showed that MSM using
PrEP were 25.3 times more likely to acquire a
Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection, 11.2 times more
likely to acquire a Chlamydia trachomatis infection,
and 44.6 times more likely to acquire a syphilis
infection versus MSM not using PrEP
.
The safety and effectiveness of pre-exposure prophylaxis
(PrEP) to prevent HIV type 1 infection among MSM has
been verified in randomized controlled trials and ‘real-
world’ studies [1,2]. However, high incidence of sexually
transmitted infections (STIs) among participants in PrEP
trials has led clinicians and public health advocates to be
concerned that PrEP use might lead to higher STI
incidence because of increased sexual risk behavior [3].
We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate differences in
STI acquisition among MSM on PrEP for HIV versus
MSM not using PrEP
.
In March 2016, we conducted a literature review with the
MeSH terms ‘SYPHILIS’ OR ‘GONORRHEA’ OR
‘CHLAMYDIA’
OR
‘HOMOSEXUALITY’
OR
‘MALE’ OR ‘TRANSGENDER PERSONS’ AND
‘COHORTSTUDIES’usingPubMedasasearchplatform.
We identified over 140000 studies, including all five
studies on PrEP (Supplemental Table; http://links.lww.
com/QAD/ A944). We restricted studies to only those
with the following inclusion criteria: English language,
cohort of MSM, and STI incidence rates reported with
nucleic acid amplification testing. We conducted a meta-
analysis of those studies to compare incidence rate ratios of
STIs between MSM using PrEP versus MSM not using
PrEP
.
Of the studies that only reported percentages of incident
infections, we estimated the number of incident infections
based on the reported percentage and total number of
participants in the study. In our meta-analysis of individual
STIs, we included all studies that reported incidence rates
of our STI of interest. The pre-exposure prophylaxis to
prevent the acquisition of HIV-1 infection (PROUD)
study [2] had two study arms to compare the effectiveness
of PrEP – an immediate PrEP intervention group and a
deferred PrEP intervention group. We included the
immediate intervention group of the PROUD study into
our MSM on PrEP group and we included the deferred
intervention group of the PROUD study into our MSM
without PrEP group in our meta-analysis.
OpenMetaAnalyst
(10.10;
Medford,
Massachusetts,
USA) was used to calculate the overall rate of incident
STIs in a meta-analysis with 95% confidence intervals.
StataSE 14.1 (College Station, Texas, USA) was used to
calculate incidence rate ratios with 95% confidence
intervals and P values comparing incident STIs in studies
of MSM on PrEP versus studies of MSM not on PrEP
.
We identified over 70 000 person-years of follow-up in 18
cohort studies of MSM with incident STIs (Supplemental
Table, http://links.lww.com/QAD/A944). Of the stu-
dies, five were conducted in MSM that were administered
PrEP and 14 were conducted in MSM without PrEP
.
Incidence rate ratios showed that MSM using PrEP were
25.3 times more likely to acquire a Neisseria gonorrhoeae
infection, 11.2 times more likely to acquire a Chlamydia
trachomatis infection, and 44.6 times more likely to acquire
a syphilis infection, when compared with MSM not using
PrEP (Table 1). We repeated the meta-analysis excluding
studies conducted before 1999 and found similar results.
Our analyses found that use of PrEP for HIV infection was
associated with increased risk of STI acquisition among
MSM. The mechanism of increased risk of STIs among
PrEP users may be due to multiple factors, including
increased STI detection among MSM clinically managed
on PrEP [4], increased number of sex partners [5], and
increased condomless sex [6]. Limitations of our analysis
include utilization of studies with heterogeneous popu-
lations, different frequencies of STI screenings, and
differences in diagnostic tests used. Also, PrEP studies
recruited MSM with high-risk sexual behavior, whereas
MSM in studies not using PrEP may have had different
baseline risk behavior.
Our results, as well as prior studies, support updating
Center for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines to
recommend that MSM using PrEP receive quarterly STI
screenings, an increase from their current guidelines that
recommend biannual to quarterly screenings [7,8].
Furthermore, physicians must not only vigilantly identify
patients that may benefit from PrEP but also provide their
patients with a sexual health prevention package that
includes quarterly STI screenings, timely treatment of

infection, expedited partner treatment, and rescreening if
positive. In addition, our results and prior reports, which
not only found a higher incidence of STI among PrEP
users versus nonusers [2] but also high rates of condomless
anal sex among PrEP users [9], suggest that more research
is needed to understand if PrEP causes a higher incidence
of STIs among MSM. We must ensure that our efforts
fighting one public health crisis do not lead to another.
