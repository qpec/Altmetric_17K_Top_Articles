Individuals with sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) frequently harbor abnormalities in the
composition of the gut microbiome; however, the microbiota associated with precancerous
lesions in hereditary CRC remains largely unknown. We studied colonic mucosa of patients
with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), who develop benign precursor lesions (polyps)
early in life. We identified patchy bacterial biofilms composed predominately of Escherichia
coli and Bacteroides fragilis. Genes for colibactin (clbB) and Bacteroides fragilis toxin (bft),
encoding secreted oncotoxins, were highly enriched in FAP patients’ colonic mucosa compared
to healthy individuals. Tumor-prone mice cocolonized with E. coli (expressing colibactin),
and enterotoxigenic B. fragilis showed increased interleukin-17 in the colon and DNA
damage in colonic epithelium with faster tumor onset and greater mortality, compared to
mice with either bacterial strain alone. These data suggest an unexpected link between
early neoplasia of the colon and tumorigenic bacteria.
C
olorectal cancer (CRC) is very common
globally and develops through accumu-
lation of colonic epithelial cell (CEC) mu-
tations that promote transition of normal
mucosa to adenocarcinoma. Around 5%
of CRC occurs in individuals with an inherited
mutation (1). One hereditary condition, famil-
ial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), is caused by
germline mutation in the APC tumor suppres-
sor gene. Individuals with FAP are born with
their first mutation in the transition to CRC,
and as somatic mutations accumulate, devel-
op hundreds to thousands of colorectal polyps.
The onset and frequency of polyp formation
within families bearing the same APC gene
mutation varies substantially (2), suggesting
that additional factors contribute to disease
onset, including components of the micro-
biome (3).
The colon contains trillions of bacteria that are
separated from the colonic epithelium by a dense
mucus layer. This mucus layer promotes tolerance
to foreign antigens by limiting bacterial–epithelial
cell contact and, thus, mucosal inflammatory re-
sponses. In contrast, bacterial breaches into the
colonic mucus layer with, in some, biofilm forma-
tion fosters chronic mucosal inflammation (4–6).
We previously reported that biofilms on nor-
mal mucosa of sporadic CRC patients were asso-
ciated with a pro-oncogenic state (6, 7), suggesting
that biofilm formation is an important epithe-
lial event influencing CRC. To test the hypoth-
esis that biofilm formation may be an early event
in the progression of hereditary colon cancer, we
examined the mucosa of FAP patients at clin-
ically indicated colectomy.
We initially screened surgically resected tis-
sue preserved in Carnoy’s fixative from five pa-
tients with FAP and one with juvenile polyposis
syndrome (table S1). Colon biopsies from indi-
viduals undergoing screening colonoscopy or
surgical resections served as controls (n = 20,
table S2). Polyps and macroscopically normal
tissue were labeled with a panbacterial 16S ribo-
somal RNA (rRNA) fluorescence in situ hybrid-
ization (FISH) probe. Each FAP patient exhibited
bacterial invasion through the mucus layer scat-
tered along the colonic axis (Fig. 1A, table S3,
and fig. S1). Unlike the continuous mucosal bio-
films in sporadic CRC patients (6), FAP tissue
displayed patchy bacterial mucus invasion (aver-
age length, 150 mm) on ~70% of the surgically
resected colon specimens collected from four of
six hereditary tumor patients. Biofilms were not
restricted to polyps, nor did they display right
colon geographic preference as observed in spo-
radic CRC (table S3 and figs. S1 and S2). Bio-
films were not detected in the mucus layer of
the FAP patient who received oral antibiotics
24 hours before surgery (table S1 and fig. S2).
Specimens with bacterial biofilms were fur-
ther screened by additional 16S rRNA probes to
recognize the major phyla detected in biofilms
of sporadic CRC; namely, Bacteroides/Prevotella,
Proteobacteria, Lachnospiraceae, and Fusobacteria
(table S4). Notably, FAP biofilms were composed
predominantly of mucus-invasive Proteobacteria
(~60 to 70%) and Bacteroides (10 to 32%)
(table S3). Fusobacteria were not detected, and
Lachnospiraceae were rare (<3%) by quantita-
tive FISH analysis (table S3).
Additional probe sets (table S4) identified the
predominant biofilm members as E. coli and
B. fragilis (Fig. 1A, bottom panels; table S3).
Invasion of the epithelial cell layer by biofilm
community members was detected in all patients
harboring biofilms (Fig. 1B), a finding similar
to that in sporadic CRC patients. Further, FISH
of mucosal biopsies from ileal pouches or ano-
rectal remnants of additional, longitudinally
followed, postcolectomy FAP patients revealed
biofilms in 36% and mucosal-associated E. coli
or B. fragilis in 50% (table S5). Thus, E. coli and
B. fragilis are frequent, persistent mucosal colo-
nizers of the FAP gastrointestinal tract. Of note,
semiquantitative colon mucosa bacterial cul-
tures of Apc MinD716/+ mice (truncation at the
716 codon of Apc), a murine correlate of FAP,
displayed similar enrichment of Bacteroides
and Enterobacteriaceae compared to wild-type
(WT) littermates, consistent with data reported
for ApcMinD850/+ mice (fig. S3) (8). These results
suggest that Apc mutations enhance mucosal bac-
terial adherence, altering the bacterial–host epi-
thelial interaction.
Strong experimental evidence exists support-
ing the carcinogenic potential of molecular sub-
types of both E. coli and B. fragilis (9, 10); the
two dominant biofilm members identified in di-
rect contact with host colon epithelial cells in our
FAP patients. E. coli containing the polyketide
synthase (pks) genotoxic island (encodes the
genes responsible for synthesis of the colibactin
genotoxin) induces DNA damage in vitro and
in vivo along with colon tumorigenesis in azoxy-
methane (AOM)–treated interleukin-10 (IL-10)–
deficient mice (10), whereas, enterotoxigenic
Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) induces colon tumori-
genesis in ApcMin/+ mice (9). Human epidemio-
logical studies have associated ETBF and pks+
E. coli with inflammatory bowel disease and
sporadic CRC (10–13). Thus, we cultured banked
frozen mucosal tissues from 25 FAP patients (two
polyps and two normal tissues per patient when
available, table S1) and 23 healthy individuals
(mucosal sample from surgical resection or one
ascending and one descending colon biopsy
per colonoscopy subject, table S2) for the pres-
ence of pks+ E. coli and ETBF. The mucosa of
FAP patients was significantly associated with
pks+ E. coli (68%) and ETBF (60%) compared

 to healthy subject mucosa (22% pks+ E. coli and
30% ETBF) (Fig. 1C). There was no preferential
association of ETBF or pks+ E. coli with polyp
or normal mucosa from FAP patients. Typically,
mucosal samples from individual patients were
concordant for pks+ E. coli or ETBF (73% for
pks+ E. coli, 59% for ETBF), similar to results for
mucosal bft detection in sporadic CRC patients
(13). Notably, pks+ E. coli and ETBF mucosal co-
association occurred at a higher rate (52%) than
expected to occur randomly (40.8%) given the
frequencies for the individual species (Fig. 1C).
Increased mucosal coassociation also occurred
in healthy control subjects (22% observed versus
6.6% expected) (Fig. 1C). Laser capture micro-
dissection of mucosal biofilms from our initial
FAP patients (fig. S2 and table S1) contained both
bft and clbB as determined by polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) analysis, indicating that the car-
cinogenic subtypes of B. fragilis and E. coli, re-
spectively, were present in the mucus layer in
direct contact with the FAP epithelium (Fig. 1D).
In contrast, neither virulence gene was detected
in the mucus layer of control subject 3760 whereas
bft was detected in the mucus layer of control
subject 3730, consistent with our prior reported
culture analysis of this sample (Fig. 1D) (13).
The high frequency of pks+ E. coli and ETBF
cocolonization in FAP colons highlights the im-
portance of understanding the potential effects
of simultaneously harboring these two carcino-
genic bacteria. Consequently, we used two mu-
rine models, AOM treatment without dextran
sodium sulfate (see materials and methods) and
ApcMinD716/+ mice to test the hypothesis that pks+
E. coli and ETBF cocolonization enhances colon
tumorigenesis compared to monocolonization
with either bacterium. The rate of spontaneous
colon tumorigenesis is very low in both model
systems.
Specific pathogen-free wild-type mice were
treated with the carcinogen AOM and monoin-
oculated or coinoculated with canonical strains
of pks+ E. coli (the murine adherent and inva-
sive strain, NC101) and ETBF (strain 086-5443-2-2)
(9, 10). Fecal ETBF or pks+ E. coli colonization
was similar under monocolonization or cocolo-
nization conditions, persisting until colon tumor
formation was assessed at 15 weeks after colo-
nization (fig. S4). Monocolonized (pks+ E. coli or
ETBF) mice displayed few to no tumors. However,
pronounced tumor induction occurred in co-
colonized mice, including an invasive cancer,
suggesting the requirement for both bacteria
to yield oncogenesis (Fig. 2, A to C). Tumori-
genesis required the presence of BFT and the
colibactin genotoxin as in-frame deletions of

 the bft gene and the pks virulence island signif-
icantly decreased tumors (Fig. 2A).
ApcMinD716/+mice cocolonized with ETBF and
pks+ E. coli exhibited enhanced morbidity with
rapid weight loss and significantly increased
mortality (P < 0.0001) [loss of 80% of the mice
(n = 8) by 8 weeks and the remaining 20% (n = 2)
at 12 weeks after colonization]. In contrast, 90%
(n = 9) and 100% (n = 10) of mice monocolonized
with ETBF or pks+ E. coli, respectively, survived
15 weeks after colonization (Fig. 2D). The robust
tumorigenesis of ETBF alone (at 15 weeks) and
cocolonized mice (majority deceased by 8 weeks
after colonization) was similar, whereas tumor
numbers were significantly increased in the co-
colonized cohort compared to pks+ E. coli alone
(fig. S5). Notably, at early time points, inflam-
mation was increased in the cocolonized cohort
compared to either ETBF or pks+ E. coli alone
(fig. S5). Together these results suggest that the
significant increase in colon inflammation and
early tumorigenesis in the cocolonized mice con-
tributed to their earlier mortality in the ApcMin/+
mouse model.
Consistent with enhanced tumorigenesis, his-
topathological analysis revealed significantly
increased colon hyperplasia and mucosal micro-
adenomas in cocolonized AOM-treated mice
compared to monocolonized mice (Fig. 3A and
fig. S6A). However, histopathology scoring re-
vealed modest differences in inflammation over
time (4 days to 15 weeks) in mono- and cocolo-
nized AOM mice (Fig. 3B and fig. S6B). Thus,
overall inflammation did not seem to explain
differential tumor induction. To determine if the
type of inflammation contributed to differences
in tumorigenesis, we analyzed lamina propria
immune-cell infiltrates of monocolonized and
cocolonized wild-type AOM mice by flow cytom-
etry. Our general lymphoid panel revealed a
marked B cell influx across all colonization
groups (Fig. 3C) but no significant differences
in the proportion of infiltrating T cells (CD4,
CD8, or gd T cells) and myeloid populations
between monocolonized and cocolonized AOM
mice (Fig. 3C) either at the acute (1-week) or
chronic (3-week) stage of infection.
Of particular interest was IL-17, as the tumori-
genic potential of ETBF in Apc MinD716/+ mice has
been attributed, in part, to IL-17 (9). Because bft
was necessary for synergistic tumor induction

 under cocolonization conditions (Fig. 2A), we
tested the role of IL-17 in the cocolonized AOM
model. Although IL-17 expression analysis by
quantitative PCR revealed no significant dif-
ference in overall mucosal IL-17 mRNA levels
between 15-week ETBF monocolonized and ETBF
and pks+ E. coli cocolonized mice (fig. S7), cocol-
onization of IL-17–deficient AOM mice ablated
tumorigenesis (Fig. 3D). To specifically test
whether ETBF and pks+ E. coli cocolonization
affected early colon mucosal IL-17 production,
germ-free C57BL/6 mice were mono- or cocol-
onized and innate and adaptive lymphocyte sub-
sets analyzed by flow cytometry. Germ-free mice
cocolonized with ETBF and pks+ E. coli dis-
played a trend toward increase in total mucosal
IL-17–producing cells when compared to mono-
colonized ETBF or pks+ E. coli mice, driven by
both adaptive [T helper 17 (TH17)] and innate
(particularly gdT17) cells (Fig. 3E and table S7).
Although necessary for tumorigenesis (Fig. 3D),
IL-17 alone appears insufficient to explain syner-
gistic tumorigenesis in cocolonized mice because
robust IL-17 induction by ETBF monocolonization
(fig. S7) induces only meager colon tumorige-
nesis in AOM mice (Fig. 2A).
Because our general lymphoid panel revealed
a marked B cell influx across all colonization
groups (Fig. 3C), we profiled the secretory im-
munoglobulin A (IgA) response by IgA enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using stool
collected 4 weeks after colonization from AOM
mice. Cocolonized mice had a significantly more
robust IgA response to pks+ E. coli than mice
monocolonized with pks+ E. coli, whereas the
fecal anti-ETBF IgA response was similar under
mono- and cocolonization conditions (Fig. 4A).
Thus, the increased fecal IgA response was spe-
cific to pks+ E. coli in mice cocolonized with ETBF,

 suggesting that cocolonization enhanced muco-
sal exposure to pks+ E. coli.
Although fecal colonization of both pks+ E. coli
and ETBF was equivalent under both mono- and
cocolonization conditions (fig. S4), quantifica-
tion of mucosal-adherent ETBF and pks+ E. coli
revealed a marked increase in mucosal-adherent
pks+ E. coli under cocolonization conditions com-
pared to pks+ E. coli monocolonization (Fig. 4B).
Hence, under monocolonization conditions,
pks+ E. coli is largely cultivatable only from the
colon lumen whereas in the presence of ETBF,
pks+ E. coli colonizes the mucosa at high lev-
els (103 to 106 colony-forming units per gram of
tissue). Using Muc-2–producing HT29-MTX-E12
monolayers in vitro, we tested the impact of
pks+ E. coli and ETBF on mucus. Although
pks+ E. coli colonization alone had no impact
on mucus depth, monolayer colonization with
ETBF alone or cocolonized with pks+ E. coli sig-
nificantly reduced mucus depth similar to colo-
nization with A. muciniphila a known human
colonic mucin-degrading bacterium (Fig. 4C).
These results suggest that mucus degradation
by ETBF promotes enhanced pks+ E. coli col-
onization. Such a shift in the bacterial niche
of pks+ E. coli would facilitate the delivery of
colibactin, the DNA-damaging toxin released
by pks+ E. coli, to colon epithelial cells. Con-
sistent with this hypothesis, g-H2AX immuno-
histochemistry revealed significantly enhanced
DNA damage in the colon epithelial cells of AOM
mice cocolonized with pks+ E. coli and ETBF
compared to monocolonized (pks+ E. coli or
ETBF) mice (Fig. 4D). Further, mice cocolonized
with ETBF and E. coliDpks displayed similarly
enhanced mucosal colonization with the E. coli
strain (fig. S8) but reduced tumors and no in-
crease in DNA damage or IL-17 (Fig. 2A and
fig. S9, A and B, respectively). Lastly, persistent
cocolonization of AOM-treated mice with the
mucin-degrading A. muciniphila and pks+ E. coli
did not enhance, but rather reduced, the modest
colon tumorigenesis (fig. S10, A and B) induced
by pks+ E. coli monocolonization. These results
suggest that mucus degradation alone was in-
sufficient to promote pks+ E. coli colon carcino-
genesis in AOM mice.

 Taken together, these data suggest that co-
colonization with ETBF and pks+ E. coli, found
in more than half of FAP patients (in contrast to
less than 25% of controls), promotes enhanced
carcinogenesis through two distinct but com-
plementary steps: (i) mucus degradation enabling
increased pks+ E. coli adherence, inducing in-
creased colonic epithelial cell DNA damage by
colibactin (Fig. 4D and fig S9); and (ii) IL-17
induction promoted, primarily, by ETBF with
early augmentation by pks+ E. coli cocoloniza-
tion (Fig. 3, D and E, and table S7). We propose
that together these mechanisms yield coopera-
tive tumor induction in AOM mice cocolonized
with ETBF and pks+ E. coli.
ETBF and pks+ E. coli commonly colonize
young children worldwide. Thus, our results sug-
gest that persistent cocolonization in the colon
mucosa from a young age may contribute to the
pathogenesis of FAP and potentially even those
who develop sporadic CRC because APC loss or
mutation occurs in the vast majority of sporadic
CRC. We note that pks+ E. coli are phenotypic
and genotypic adherent and invasive E. coli
(AIEC) (14). Despite this designation, derived
primarily from in vitro cell culture experiments,
the canonical pks+ E. coli strain (NC101) used in
our experiments was only cultivatable from the
colon lumen in the absence of concomitant ETBF
colonization in our mouse model. This ETBF-
dependent shift to marked mucosal pks+ E. coli
colonization is consistent with our observations
that ETBF and pks+ E. coli cocolonize FAP colon
biofilms, where both bacteria invade and cocolo-
nize the mucus layer throughout the FAP colon.
These findings suggest that analysis of coexpres-
sion of bft and clbB may have value in general
screening and potential prevention of CRC.
