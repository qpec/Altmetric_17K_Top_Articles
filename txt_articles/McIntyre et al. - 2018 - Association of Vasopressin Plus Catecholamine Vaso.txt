IMPORTANCE Vasopressin is an alternative to catecholamine vasopressors for patients with
distributive shock—a condition due to excessive vasodilation, most frequently from severe
infection. Blood pressure support with a noncatecholamine vasopressor may reduce
stimulation of adrenergic receptors and decrease myocardial oxygen demand. Atrial
fibrillation is common with catecholamines and is associated with adverse events, including
mortality and increased length of stay (LOS).
OBJECTIVES To determine whether treatment with vasopressin + catecholamine
vasopressors compared with catecholamine vasopressors alone was associated with
reductions in the risk of adverse events.
DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL were searched from inception to February
2018. Experts were asked and meta-registries searched to identify ongoing trials.
STUDY SELECTION Pairs of reviewers identified randomized clinical trials comparing
vasopressin in combination with catecholamine vasopressors to catecholamines alone for
patients with distributive shock.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two reviewers abstracted data independently.
A random-effects model was used to combine data.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was atrial fibrillation. Other
outcomes included mortality, requirement for renal replacement therapy (RRT), myocardial
injury, ventricular arrhythmia, stroke, and LOS in the intensive care unit and hospital.
Measures of association are reported as risk ratios (RRs) for clinical outcomes and mean
differences for LOS.
RESULTS Twenty-three randomized clinical trials were identified (3088 patients;
mean age, 61.1 years [14.2]; women, 45.3%). High-quality evidence supported a lower
risk of atrial fibrillation associated with vasopressin treatment (RR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.67 to
0.88]; risk difference [RD], −0.06 [95% CI, −0.13 to 0.01]). For mortality, the overall RR
estimate was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.82 to 0.97; RD, −0.04 [95% CI, −0.07 to 0.00]); however,
when limited to trials at low risk of bias, the RR estimate was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.84 to 1.11).
The overall RR estimate for RRT was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.51 to 1.08; RD, −0.07 [95% CI, −0.12 to
−0.01]). However, in an analysis limited to trials at low risk of bias, RR was 0.70 (95% CI,
0.53 to 0.92, P for interaction = .77). There were no significant differences in the pooled risks
for other outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this systematic review and meta-analysis, the addition of
vasopressin to catecholamine vasopressors compared with catecholamines alone was
associated with a lower risk of atrial fibrillation. Findings for secondary outcomes varied.

n distributive shock, widespread vasodilation leads to
decreased systemic vascular resistances and mean arte-
rial pressure (MAP).1 If not reversed, end-organ hypoper-
fusion results in significant morbidity; mortality rates
reached 50% in observational studies conducted in 2013
and 2014.2,3 Sepsis is the most common cause of distribu-
tive shock. It can also occur after cardiovascular surgery,
spinal cord injury, or arise as a consequence of anaphylaxis
or prolonged hypoperfusion.1,4
Managing distributive shock involves treating the under-
lying cause, volume resuscitation, and infusing vasopressors
to maintain a perfusing blood pressure.5,6 Clinicians fre-
quently use catecholaminergic vasopressors (eg, norepineph-
rine, epinephrine, dopamine, dobutamine). However, cat-
echolamines have adverse effects including myocardial
ischemia and arrhythmia,6-8 which may affect outcomes.9
Atrial fibrillation is a common adverse event in patients
with distributive shock and is independently associated with
morbidity, mortality, and increases in length of stay (LOS).10-12
Vasopressin, an endogenous peptide hormone, can also
be used as a vasopressor. Patients with septic shock have
relative vasopressin deficiency and exogenous administra-
tion of vasopressin raises blood pressure by increasing vascu-
lar tone.13 By reducing the requirement for catecholamines, it
decreases the stimulation of arrhythmogenic myocardial
β1-receptors and associated myocardial oxygen demand.7,14
This, among other mechanisms, may translate into a reduc-
tion in adverse events, including atrial fibrillation, injury to
other organs, and death.7,15 The most recent Surviving Sepsis
guidelines suggest adding vasopressin to norepinephrine to
raise MAP to target, or adding vasopressin to decrease nor-
epinephrine dosage (weak recommendations, moderate
quality of evidence).5
The objective of this systematic review and meta-
analysis was to determine the association between treatment
with vasopressin in addition to catecholamine vasopressors on
atrial fibrillation, morbidity, and mortality compared with cat-
echolamines alone.
Methods
The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (2017:
CRD42017059058).Theconductandreportingofthestudyfol-
low the PRISMA guidelines.
Eligibility Criteria
Randomized clinical trials were included, irrespective of
publication status, date of publication, risk of bias, out-
comes published, or language. Trials were included if
they enrolled adults with distributive shock, including
septic shock, post–cardiovascular surgery vasoplegia, neuro-
genic shock, and anaphylaxis. Included studies had to
compare the administration of vasopressin (or analogues
[eg, terlipressin, selepressin]) with or without concomitant
catecholaminergic vasopressors with the administration of
catecholaminergic vasopressors alone, irrespective of dose,
duration, or co-intervention.
The primary outcome was atrial fibrillation. Secondary
outcomes were mortality, requirement for renal replace-
ment therapy (RRT), myocardial injury, ventricular arrhyth-
mia, stroke, and LOS in the intensive care unit (ICU) and
hospital (eAppendices 4-5 in the Supplement). Acute kidney
injury and digital ischemia were post hoc outcomes.
The outcomes were accepted as defined by study
authors. For mortality, mortality at 28 to 30 days, at longest
follow-up, and in-hospital were considered equivalent; ICU
mortality was not pooled. Under digital ischemia, limb ische-
mia and peripheral ischemia or cyanosis were included.
Myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia, troponin rise,
and acute coronary syndrome were pooled under myocardial
injury. Ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation were pooled as
ventricular arrhythmia. Cerebrovascular accident was com-
bined with stroke.
Search Methods
MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL were searched for key-
words describing the condition, intervention, or comparator
from inception to February 25, 2018 (eAppendices 1-3 in
the Supplement). An information specialist reviewed the
search strategies.
Trial registries were searched for ongoing and unpub-
lished clinical trials via http://www.isrctn.com using the
multiple database search option metaRegister of Controlled
Trials and the World Health Organization trial registry.
Authors hand-searched the conference proceedings for the
scientific sessions of the European Society of Intensive Care
Medicine, the Society of Critical Care Medicine, and the
American Thoracic Society in the last 2 years. The references
of eligible papers were screened and experts were consulted
to identify additional trials.
Data Collection and Analysis
Two reviewers independently screened studies’ titles
and abstracts for eligibility. Full papers of the potentially eli-
gible studies were retrieved. The same 2 reviewers then inde-
pendently screened full texts in duplicate and recorded the
main reason for exclusion. Disagreements were resolved
through discussion.
Key Points
Question In patients with distributive shock (a condition due
to excessive vasodilation, most frequently from severe infection),
is the addition of vasopressin to catecholamine vasopressors
superior to catecholamine vasopressors alone for atrial fibrillation?
Findings In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 23 trials
that included 3088 patients with distributive shock, the addition
of vasopressin to catecholamine vasopressors compared with
catecholamine vasopressors alone was significantly associated
with a lower risk of atrial fibrillation (relative risk, 0.77).
Meaning Addition of vasopressin to catecholamines may offer
a clinical advantage for prevention of atrial fibrillation.

 Data Extraction and Management
Independently,2reviewersabstracteddataoninterventionand
outcome. They also recorded study and patient characteris-
tics including age, sex, type of shock, and concomitant con-
ditions (eg, cirrhosis, malignancy). They compared results and
resolved disagreements by discussion with a third party.
Authors were contacted to clarify ambiguities and to request
data on outcomes missing in primary reports.
Assessment of Risk of Bias
In duplicate, 2 review authors assessed risk of bias.16 In each
trial, reviewers evaluated the following domains: sequence
generation, allocation concealment, blinding of patients and
personnel, blinding of outcome assessors, incomplete out-
come data, and selective reporting. The results were com-
pared and disagreements resolved by discussion. Perfor-
mance and detection bias were assessed separately. All
open-label studies were classified as being at high risk of per-
formance bias. A priori, the decision was made to classify
open-label designs as “likely low risk of bias” for detection
bias for mortality, stroke, and LOS in the absence of other
concerns, but to judge “likely high risk of bias” for detection
bias for atrial fibrillation, RRT, digital ischemia, myocardial
injury, and ventricular arrhythmia. For analysis and presenta-
tion purposes, risk of bias was dichotomized as high (or likely
high) or low (or likely low).
For subgroup analyses, the study-level risk of bias was
assessed for each outcome. If a study was at risk of selec-
tion, performance, detection, or reporting bias for that out-
come, it was categorized as high risk of bias. Additionally,
studies at risk of attrition bias were categorized as high risk
of bias for mortality.
Measures of Association With Treatment
The main reported standard association measure for clinical
outcomes was risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences for LOS.
Risk difference and absolute risk difference were also calcu-
lated for clinical outcomes. The absolute risk difference was
obtained by applying the RRs with 95% CIs to the baseline
risk in the control group. To permit meta-analysis, if a study
reporting on LOS provided a median and a measure of disper-
sion, this was converted to mean and standard deviation
assuming a normal distribution.17
Clinical and methodological heterogeneity were
assessed based on study characteristics. Statistical hetero-
geneity was measured with the I2 statistic. An I2 statistic
greater than 50% was considered as showing substantial
heterogeneity.16
RevMan (Cochrane Collaboration), version 5.3, was used
to combine data quantitatively when clinical heterogeneity
was nonsubstantial. A random-effects model with Mantel-
Haenszel weighting was used because several comparisons
were expected to show heterogeneity. After recognizing that
a substantial proportion of the weight for atrial fibrillation
was contributed by a single study,18 we combined data for
this outcome with a fixed-effect model in a sensitivity analy-
sis. For trials in which patients crossed over to the other
treatment, the analysis was according to their first assigned
group (intention-to-treat principle). Two-sided P values less
than .05 were considered statistically significant.
Subgroup and Sensitivity Analyses
Prespecified subgroup analyses were performed hypothesiz-
ing that patients with sepsis would derive greater benefit vs
cardiovascular surgery. As a separate sensitivity analysis for
RRT, the outcome definition was changed to acute kidney in-
jury, as defined by study authors. P values for interaction be-
tween subgroups were tested.
Assessment of the Quality of the Evidence
The GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Devel-
opment, and Evaluation) approach19 was used to grade the
quality of evidence. GRADE appraises the confidence in esti-
mates of effect by considering within-study risk of bias, di-
rectness of the evidence, heterogeneity of the data, precision
of effect estimates, and risk of publication bias. Funnel plots
of standard errors vs effect estimates were inspected for pub-
lication bias and small-study effects.
Results

The electronic search resulted in 1210 unique citations
(Figure 1). After reference and full-text screening, 23 studies
met eligibility criteria. Details on excluded and included stud-
ies and 3 potentially relevant ongoing studies are available
(eAppendices 6-8 in the Supplement).

 Two studies evaluated patients with post–cardiac sur-
gery vasoplegia.18,28 Vasopressin was the intervention
in 13 trials,18,23,24,27-30,33-37,39 whereas 9 studied terli-
pressin,20-22,25,26,32,35,38,41 1 studied selepressin,40 and 1 stud-
ied pituitrin (a mixture of vasopressin and oxytocin).31
One 3-group study compared vasopressin vs terlipressin vs
norepinephrine alone.35 Five studies were published only
as abstracts.18,21,27,36,38
Risk of Bias
Fifteen of 23 trials were not blinded (eAppendices 9-10 in the
Supplement). Performance bias due to lack of blinding was
judged to have an important effect on all outcomes; patients
with distributive shock are critically ill and receiving many
concomitant interventions that could be influenced by choice
of concomitant vasopressor. Atrial fibrillation, myocardial
injury, and digital ischemia are vulnerable to detection bias
from differential capture and subjective interpretation; lack
of blinding of clinicians and outcome assessors may influ-
ence these outcomes. The decision to start RRT could also be
subjective. Other outcomes were judged to be at low risk of
detection bias in the absence of blinding. Two studies were
assessed to be at risk of selection bias due to inadequate
randomization31,36; they did not describe their randomiza-
tion process and had significant between-group imbalances.
Nine studies (39%) reported the information necessary to
make a definitive judgment for selection bias. Authors relied
on imbalances between groups and overall methodological
quality of the study to make this judgment. Attrition was
found in 7 studies,18,25,30,31,36,40,41 and judged as having an
effect on mortality (Table 2 and Figure 2A). Reporting bias
was not detected. “Other bias” was judged to be present
when studies were published as abstracts only. Prespecified
sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness
of estimates to risk of bias if studies were dichotomized
according to their risk of bias.
Primary Outcome
Atrial Fibrillation
Pooling data from 13 studies (4 studies with 0 events in either
group, 1462 patients, 374 events) demonstrated a significant
reduction in the risk of atrial fibrillation associated with the
administration of vasopressin (RR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.67 to
0.88], I2 = 1%; risk difference [RD], −0.06 [95% CI, −0.13
to 0.01]) (Figure 2A). Based on the GRADE framework, this
was judged to be high-quality evidence (eAppendix 13 in the

 Supplement). This result was driven by the study by Hajjar
et al,18 which carried 74.8% of the weight. In absolute terms,
the absolute effect is that 68 fewer people per 1000 patients
(95% CI, 36 to 98) will experience atrial fibrillation when
vasopressin is added to catecholaminergic vasopressors.
In a sensitivity analysis excluding the 7 studies at high risk
of bias for lack of blinding of outcome assessors,20,26-28,33,35
the estimate of effect was unchanged (eAppendix 11 in the
Supplement). In a second sensitivity analysis, patients with
sepsis and post–cardiac surgery were considered separately.
For the subgroup of post–cardiac surgery patients,18,28 the
resultant RR estimate was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.67 to 0.88), not
significantly different than in patients with sepsis (RR, 0.76
[95% CI, 0.55 to 1.05], P for interaction = .97) (Table 2). Even
though the crude rate of atrial fibrillation in this post–cardiac
surgery population (73%) was considerably higher than in the
sepsis studies (13%), the relative effect estimate was similar
in both groups.
Secondary Outcomes
Mortality
Mortality data were available from 17 studies (2904 patients,
1123 events) (Figure 2B). When pooled, the administration of
vasopressin in addition to catecholamines was associated
with a reduction in mortality (RR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.82 to
0.97], P = .009, I2 = 0; RD, −0.04 [95% CI, −0.07 to 0.00]).
In absolute terms, 45 lives (95% CI, 12 to 73) would be saved
per 1000 patients treated with vasopressin. However, when
limited to the 2 trials at low risk of bias (Table 3),24,39 the RR
estimate was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.84 to 1.11).
Requirement for RRT and Acute Kidney Injury
Six trials with a total of 805 patients (222 events) reported
on RRT (Figure 3A). When combined, vasopressin was asso-
ciated with a reduced risk for RRT, but the pooled estimate
did not reach statistical significance and showed substantial
heterogeneity (RR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.51 to 1.08], I2 = 70%; RD,
−0.07 [95% CI, −0.12 to −0.01]; moderate-quality evidence).
However, when the analysis was limited to the 2 trials at low
risk of bias,24,30 the point estimate was similar, but vaso-
pressin was associated with a significant reduction in the
risk of RRT without evidence of heterogeneity (RR, 0.70
[95% CI, 0.53 to 0.92], I2 = 0%, P for interaction = .77).
Myocardial Injury
Eleven studies (1957 patients, 133 events) reported on myo-
cardial injury; 2 trials had event rates of 0 in both groups.
There was no significant difference in the risk of myocardial
injury with vasopressin (RR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.63 to 1.17],
I2 = 0%; RD, 0.00 [95% CI, −0.02 to 0.02]; low-quality evi-
dence). After excluding studies at high risk of bias from
open-label design,20,28,33,41 the estimate did not change
significantly. Because surrogates were reported for myocar-
dial injury (eg, altered ST segments), indirectness was rated
as serious.
Ventricular Arrhythmia, Stroke, and Length of Stay
When 9 studies reporting on ventricular arrhythmia were
pooled (837 patients, 87 events), the risk was not significantly
different with vasopressin (RR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.73 to 1.19],
I2 = 0%; RD, 0.00 [95% CI, −0.02 to 0.01]; low-quality evi-
dence). There was no significant difference when pooling
data from 4 studies (1358 patients, 17 events) reporting on
stroke (RR, 1.61 [95% CI, 0.53 to 4.95], I2 = 7%; RD, 0.01 [95%
CI, −0.02 to 0.04]; moderate-quality evidence). LOS data
were reported exclusively as medians with interquartile
range and were transformed to estimate mean LOS with stan-
dard deviation. Hospital LOS was not significantly associated
with vasopressin (8 studies, 1939 patients; mean difference,
−1.14 days [95% CI, −3.60 to 1.32], I2=75%; low-quality evi-
dence) (Table 4). Similarly, ICU LOS was not significantly
associated with vasopressin (mean difference, −0.40 days
[95% CI, −1.05 to 0.25], I2= 24%; moderate-quality evidence)
when 11 studies were combined (2156 patients).

bDünser et al, 2003,28 included patients with both sepsis and post–cardiac
surgery vasoplegia, but subgroup data were obtained for atrial fibrillation only.
This study was excluded from other outcomes when sepsis and post–cardiac
surgery vasoplegia were compared.
c Morelli et al, 2009,35 comprised 3 groups (vasopressin vs terlipressin vs
norepinephrine). It was considered as 2 separate trials (vasopressin vs
norepinephrine and terlipressin vs norepinephrine) in the comparison
between vasopressin and vasopressin analogs. It was considered as a single
trial (vasopressin or terlipressin vs norepinephrine) in all other comparisons.

 Post Hoc Outcomes
Digital Ischemia
When 9 studies (1963 patients, 58 events) were pooled
(Figure 3B), vasopressin in addition to catecholamines was as-
sociatedwithasignificantincreaseindigitalischemia(RR,2.38
[95% CI, 1.37 to 4.12], I2 = 0; RD, 0.02 [95% CI, −0.01 to 0.04];
moderate-quality evidence). In absolute terms, this means 24
more occurrences (95% CI, 6 to 55) of digital ischemia per 1000
patients treated with vasopressin. When the 4 studies at high
risk of bias were excluded,23,26,29,41 the resultant estimate was
not significantly different. Definitions varied for this out-
come; however, when the analysis was limited to the 6 stud-
ies that specifically described “digital ischemia,
”18,23,29,30,39,40
the resultant estimate did not change significantly. Thus, evi-
dencewasnotdowngradedforindirectnessbut,becauseitwas
a post hoc outcome, it was downgraded for risk of bias.
Acute Kidney Injury
In a sensitivity analysis, the treatment effect for RRT was con-
sistent,butnotstatisticallysignificantwhenthedefinitionwas
modified to acute kidney injury (5 trials; RR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.46
to 1.17], I2 = 91%).
Publication Bias
The assessment of publication bias was limited by small num-
bers of studies for most outcomes (eAppendix 12 in the Supple-
ment). Visual inspection did not lead to concerns about pub-
lication bias.

 Discussion
In this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized
clinical trials, the administration of vasopressin in addition
to catecholamine vasopressors in patients with distributive
shock was associated with a significant reduction in the risk
of atrial fibrillation when compared with catecholamines
alone (high-quality evidence). Findings for other outcomes
were not consistent. Although when all studies were com-
bined the risk of mortality was lower with the addition of
vasopressin, a sensitivity analysis limited to low risk of bias
trials yielded a relative risk much closer to 1 and was not sta-
tistically significant.
To our knowledge, this systematic review is the first on
the topic to include atrial fibrillation as an outcome. Prior
reviews assessed arrhythmia,42,43 but this outcome has lim-
ited utility due to the variety of conditions that could be
found under this heading. The reduction in atrial fibrillation
associated with vasopressin was consistent across 2 sub-
types of distributive shock and in sensitivity analyses
restricted to studies at low risk of bias.
Vasopressin may have contributed to a reduction of
atrial fibrillation by sparing the adrenergic stimulation pro-
vided by catecholaminergic vasopressors.6-8,14 This could
have manifested in fewer patients developing atrial fibrilla-
tion or may have caused atrial fibrillation to be shorter in
duration and lower in rate and, in consequence, less likely
to be detected.
The approach to monitoring and ascertainment of atrial
fibrillation in patients who are acutely ill affects the detection
of this outcome.44 This limitation would need to be ad-
dressed to more precisely estimate event rates in this popula-
tion and their association with vasopressin treatment.

 The clinical significance of atrial fibrillation in this popula-
tion is not fully understood.44 Where atrial fibrillation in
patients who are critically ill has been associated with worse
outcomes, including death, causality has not been proven
and the consequences on long-term prognosis in survivors
are unknown.10,11,44
This review is one of few reviews to directly compare
vasopressin + catecholamines against the current standard
of care—catecholamines alone. Two systematic reviews
with network meta-analyses found no difference in mortal-
ity in any comparison, including between vasopressin
or terlipressin and norepinephrine.42,43 Another system-
atic review and meta-analysis concluded that treatment
with noncatecholaminergic agents (including vasopressin
and methylene blue) improved survival (RR, 0.88 [95% CI,
0.79 to 0.98]) in patients experiencing or “at risk” for dis-
tributive shock.45 In another systematic review and meta-
analysis, mortality was significantly lower in patients
with septic shock treated with vasopressin or terlipressin
compared with norepinephrine (RR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.78
to 0.97]).46 However, that review included 4 substudies
of the Vasopressin and Septic Shock Trial (VASST) in the
meta-analysis of mortality and did not assess evidence
using GRADE.19,39,47
The theoretical basis for vasopressin administration
stems from research identifying relative vasopressin defi-
ciency in patients with distributive shock.13 Vasopressin
administration could lower mortality by decreasing the
need for catecholaminergic drugs and reducing their
adverse effects including arrhythmia, preferentially perfus-
ing the brain and renal vascular bed—the latter leading to
reductions in acute kidney injury—and decreasing activa-
tion of both the renin-aldosterone-angiotensin system and
neurohormonal processes, inhibiting proinflammatory
cytokines, improving calcium handling, and potentiating
endogenous glucocorticoids.47-50
For clinicians aiming for MAP, maintaining adequate
blood flow while mitigating the risk of excessive vasocon-
striction (the likely mechanism of digital ischemia) is also
important. An understanding of the clinical effect of these
events (ie, did they simply precipitate drug discontinuation
or did they lead to permanent disability?) would be needed
to evaluate trade-off against a decrease in mortality.
This systematic review also evaluated requirement for
RRT. The significant reduction in need for RRT with vaso-
pressin was limited to the pooled estimate for low risk of bias
studies. Renal protection related to reduced activation of the
renin-aldosterone-angiotensin system is one of the hypoth-
esized benefits of vasopressin in distributive shock; creati-
nine clearance has been shown to improve when vasopressin
was started early after the onset of distributive shock.33
This review included data from the relatively large and
recently published Vasopressin vs Norepinephrine in Patients
with Vasoplegic Shock after Cardiac Surgery (VANCS) and
Effect of Early Vasopressin vs Norepinephrine on Kidney
Failure in Patients With Septic Shock (VANISH) trials (751
patients total).18,30 Combining subtypes of distributive shock
and considering vasopressin analogs allowed the inclusion of
a larger number of studies. Bias in the review process was
reduced by searching multiple databases without language
restriction. Significant attempts were made to obtain clarifi-
cation of published data and access to unpublished data.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, subgroup analyses
were restricted by the study-level nature of the data. Sec-
ond, the quality of reporting for many studies was not suffi-
cient to permit definitive judgments about risk of bias in all

 domains. Third, there are likely differences in the way vaso-
pressors were initiated, titrated, and weaned between stud-
ies and approaches were infrequently described in detail.
However, the general approach seemed to be to up-titrate
vasopressin until the maximum dose or target MAP was
reached and then to add or wean norepinephrine as needed
to reach the target MAP.
Conclusions
In this meta-analysis, the addition of vasopressin to catechol-
amine vasopressors compared with catecholamines alone
was associated with a lower risk of atrial fibrillation. How-
ever, findings for secondary outcomes varied.
