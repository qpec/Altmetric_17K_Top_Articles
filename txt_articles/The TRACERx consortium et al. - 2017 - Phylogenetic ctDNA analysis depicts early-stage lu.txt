Summary
The early detection of relapse following primary surgery for non-small cell lung cancer and the 
characterization of emerging subclones seeding metastatic sites might offer new therapeutic 
approaches to limit tumor recurrence. The potential to non-invasively track tumor evolutionary 
dynamics in ctDNA of early-stage lung cancer is not established. Here we conduct a tumour-
specific phylogenetic approach to ctDNA profiling in the first 100 TRACERx (TRAcking non-
small cell lung Cancer Evolution through therapy (Rx)) study participants, including one patient 
co-recruited to the PEACE (Posthumous Evaluation of Advanced Cancer Environment) post-
mortem study. We identify independent predictors of ctDNA release and perform tumor volume 
limit of detection analyses. Through blinded profiling of post-operative plasma, we observe 
evidence of adjuvant chemotherapy resistance and identify patients destined to experience 
recurrence of their lung cancer. Finally, we show that phylogenetic ctDNA profiling tracks the 
subclonal nature of lung cancer relapse and metastases, providing a new approach for ctDNA 
driven therapeutic studies

 Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death1–2. Metastatic non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) cannot be cured with systemic chemotherapy, yet clinical studies have shown a 
5% benefit of post-operative (adjuvant) chemotherapy on overall survival3. This modest 
survival benefit may reflect a vulnerability of low volume disease within the context of 
reduced intratumor heterogeneity4. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) detection in plasma 
following resection of breast5,6 and colorectal7 tumors has been shown to identify patients 
destined to relapse post-operatively in advance of established clinical parameters. 
Identifying, monitoring and genomically characterizing residual disease following primary 
lung cancer surgery may improve outcomes in the adjuvant setting. This would create a 
therapeutic setting where only patients destined to recur would receive treatment and where 
intervention could be directed to the evolving tumor subclone that is seeding metastatic 
recurrence.
Here, we report a bespoke multiplex-PCR NGS approach to ctDNA profiling within the 
context of the prospective tumor evolutionary NSCLC TRACERx study. We address 
determinants of ctDNA detection in early-stage NSCLC and investigate the ability of ctDNA 
to identify and genomically characterize post-operative NSCLC relapse within a tumor 
phylogenetic framework.
Phylogenetic ctDNA profiling
The TRACERx study monitors the clonal evolution of NSCLC from diagnosis through to 
death8,9. Using multi-region exome sequencing (M-Seq) derived tumor phylogenetic trees 
developed through prospective analysis of a 100 patient TRACERx cohort, we conducted a 
phylogenetic approach to ctDNA profiling in early-stage NSCLC (Fig. 1). Bespoke 
multiplex-PCR assay-panels were synthesised for each patient, targeting clonal and 
subclonal single nucleotide variants (SNVs) selected to track phylogenetic tumor branches 
in plasma (Fig. 1). SNV detection in plasma was established through a calling algorithm 
employing negative control samples (see Methods). Analytical validation of the multiplex-
PCR NGS platform demonstrated a sensitivity of above 99% for the detection of SNVs at 
frequencies above 0.1% and the specificity of detecting a single SNV was 99.6% (Extended 
Data Fig. 1a). At least two SNVs were detected in ctDNA from early-stage NSCLCs 
analyzed in our published discovery cohort data10, demonstrating biological sensitivity of a 
two SNV threshold for ctDNA detection. Therefore, we prospectively selected a threshold of 
two detected SNVs for calling a sample ctDNA positive for validation within this study; to 
minimize type I error when testing up to 30 tumour-specific SNVs per time-point in a single 
patient (see Extended Data Fig. 1b for justification).
Determinants of ctDNA detection in NSCLC
We sought to identify clinicopathological determinants of ctDNA detection in early-stage 
NSCLC by profiling pre-operative plasma samples in 100 TRACERx patients. Samples from 
four patients could not be analyzed (see cohort design Extended Data Fig. 2a, patient 
characteristics Extended Table 1a-c, Supplementary Table 1). Individual assay-panels were 
designed to target a median of 18 SNVs (range 10 to 22) comprising a median of 11 clonal

 SNVs (range 2 to 20) and a median of 6 subclonal SNVs (range 0 to 16) per patient 
(Extended Data Fig. 2b,e).
At least two SNVs were detected in ctDNA pre-operatively in 46 of 96 (48%) early-stage 
NSCLCs and a single SNV was detected in 12 additional cases (Fig. 2a). Centrally reviewed 
pathological data revealed that ctDNA detection was associated with histological subtype: 
97% (30/31) of lung squamous cell carcinomas (LUSCs) and 71% (5 of 7) of other NSCLC 
subtypes were ctDNA positive, compared with 19% (11/58) of lung adenocarcinomas 
(LUADs) (Fig. 2a). 94% (16 of 17) of stage I LUSCs were detected compared with 13% (5 
of 39) of stage I LUADs (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Passive release of ctDNA into the 
circulation may be associated with necrosis11. As expected LUSCs were significantly more 
necrotic than LUADs12 and ctDNA positive LUADs formed a sub-group of more necrotic 
tumors compared with ctDNA negative LUADs (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Necrosis, lymph 
node involvement, lymphovascular invasion, pathological tumor size, Ki67 labelling indices, 
non-adenocarcinoma histology and total cell-free DNA input predicted ctDNA detection in 
univariable analyses (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Multivariable analysis revealed non-
adenocarcinoma histology, the presence of lympho-vascular invasion and high Ki67 
proliferation index as independent predictors of ctDNA detection (Extended Data Fig. 3c). 
Since FDG-avidity on positron emission tomography (PET) scans correlates with 
proliferative indices in early-stage NSCLC13,14, we investigated tumor PET FDG-avidity 
and ctDNA detection. PET FDG-avidity predicted ctDNA detection (area under curve = 
0.84, P<0.001, n=92) (Extended Data Fig. 3d). Within LUADs, driver events in KRAS, 
EGFR or TP53 were not associated with ctDNA detection (Extended Data Fig. 3e).
We analyzed the distribution of clonal and subclonal SNVs in ctDNA positive patients. 
Clonal SNVs were detected in all 46 ctDNA positive patients and a median of 94% (range 
11% to 100%) of clonal SNVs targeted by assay-panels were detected in the ctDNA of these 
patients. 40 of 46 ctDNA positive patients had subclonal SNVs targeted by assay-panels and 
subclonal SNVs were detected in 27 (68%) of these patients. A median of 27% (range 0% to 
91%) of subclonal SNVs within individual assay-panels were detected in ctDNA positive 
patients (Fig. 2b). The mean plasma variant allele frequency (VAF) of clonal SNVs was 
higher than that of subclonal SNVs (Extended Data Fig. 4a, within patient comparison, 
Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P<0.001, n=27, Supplementary Table 2) supporting the use of 
clonal alterations as a more sensitive method of ctDNA detection than subclonal 
alterations10,15.
In ctDNA positive patients, pathologic tumor size correlated with mean clonal plasma VAF 
(Spearman’ s Rho = 0.405, P=0.005, n=46, Extended Data Fig. 4b). CT scan volumetric 
analyses were evaluated in 37 of 46 ctDNA positive patients (see Extended Data Fig. 4c). 
Tumor volume correlated with mean clonal plasma VAF (Fig 3a, Spearman’ s Rho = 0.63, 
P<0.001, n=37). A linear relationship between log- transformed volume and log- 
transformed mean clonal VAF values was observed (Fig. 3a). The line of best fit applied to 
the data was consistent with the line fitted to NSCLC volumetric data and ctDNA plasma 
VAFs reported in previously published work16 (Extended Data Fig. 4d). Linear modelling 
based on the TRACERx data predicted that a primary tumor burden of 10cm3 would result 
in a mean clonal plasma VAF of 0.1% (95% C.I. 0.06 to 0.18%) (Fig. 3b). Tumor purity was

 multiplied by tumor volume to control for stromal contamination to determine cancer cell 
volume corresponding to clonal plasma VAF (Extended Data Fig. 4e). On the assumption 
that 1cm3 of pure tumor contains 9.4 x 107 cells17, a plasma VAF of 0.1% would correspond 
to a primary NSCLC malignant burden of 302 million cells (Fig 3b, Extended Data Fig. 4f).
To investigate predictors of subclone detection, detected subclonal SNVs were mapped back 
to M-seq derived tumor phylogenetic trees. 35 of 57 (61%) shared subclones (identified in 
more than one tumor region through M-Seq analysis) were identified in ctDNA, compared 
with 26 of 80 (33%) private subclones (detected in a single tumor region only) (Extended 
Data Fig 4g). This suggested subclone volume influences subclonal ctDNA detection. 
Subclone volume was estimated based on mean regional subclone cancer cell fraction and 
cancer cell volume. Detected subclonal SNVs mapped to subclones with higher estimated 
volumes than subclones containing undetected SNVs (Fig. 3c) and subclone volume 
correlated with subclonal SNV plasma VAF (Fig. 3d).
Detecting and characterizing NSCLC relapse
The longitudinal phase of the study aimed to determine if ctDNA profiling with patient-
specific assay panels could detect and characterize the branched subclone(s) seeding 
NSCLC relapse. Pre- and post-surgical plasma ctDNA profiling was performed blinded to 
relapse status in a sub-group of 24 patients (cohort characteristics, Extended Table 1d-e). 
This included relapse free patients who had been followed-up for a median of 775 days 
(range 688 to 945 days, n=10) and confirmed NSCLC relapse cases (n=14) (cohort design, 
Extended Data Fig. 2c). Additional PCR assays were added to panels in this phase of the 
study to attempt to improve ctDNA detection in LUADs, a median of 18.5 SNVs (range 12 
to 20) were targeted by LUSC assay-panels and a median of 28 SNVs (range 25 to 30) were 
targeted by LUAD assay-panels (Extended Data Fig. 2d-e).
Patients were followed up with three to six monthly clinical assessment and chest 
radiographs. At least 2 SNVs were detected in 13 of 14 (93%) patients with confirmed 
NSCLC relapse prior to, or at, clinical relapse (Fig 4a-g, Extended Data Fig. 5). At least two 
SNVs were detected in 1 of 10 (10%) patients (CRUK0013) with no clinical evidence of 
NSCLC relapse (Fig. 4h, Extended Data Fig. 6). Excluding a single case where no post-
operative plasma was taken prior to clinical relapse (CRUK0041), the median interval 
between ctDNA detection and NSCLC relapse confirmed on clinically indicated CT imaging 
(lead-time) was 70 days (range 10 to 346 days). Four of 13 relapse cases exhibited lead-
times of more than six months (Fig. 4a-d). In two cases ctDNA detection preceded CT 
imaging inconclusive for NSCLC relapse by 157 days (CRUK0004, Fig 4b) and 163 days 
(CRUK0045, Fig 4d). ctDNA profiling reflected adjuvant chemotherapy resistance - 
CRUK0080, CRUK0004 and CRUK0062 had detectable ctDNA in plasma within 30 days of 
surgery. The number of detectable SNVs increased in all three cases despite adjuvant 
chemotherapy, with disease recurring within 1 year of surgery (Fig. 4a-c). In contrast, 
CRUK0013 had 20 SNVs detectable in ctDNA 72 hours after surgery and 13 SNVs 
detectable prior to adjuvant chemotherapy; 51 days following completion of adjuvant 
treatment and at post-operative days 457 and 667 no SNVs were detectable and the patient 
remains relapse free 688 days post-surgery (Fig. 4h). ctDNA profiling detected intracerebral

 relapse; CRUK0029 had a PET scan performed 50 days prior to surgery demonstrating 
normal cerebral appearances. ctDNA remained detectable following surgery, 54 days post-
operatively the patient was diagnosed with intracerebral metastasis, no extracranial disease 
was evident on CT imaging (Fig. 4e).
We sought to resolve subclonal evolutionary-dynamics associated with NSCLC relapse. 
Subclonal SNVs displaying plasma VAFs similar to clonal SNVs from clusters confined to a 
single phylogenetic branch, were detected post-operatively in the ctDNA of four patients 
who suffered NSCLC relapse (CRUK0004, CRUK0063, CRUK0065 and CRUK0044) (Fig. 
4b,f-g, Extended Data Fig 5b). This suggested a relapse process dominated by one subclone 
represented in our assay-panel. The subclone implicated by ctDNA as driving the relapse in 
the case of CRUK0004 contained an ERRB2 (HER2) amplification event (>15 copies, 
triploid background), that may be targetable in NSCLC18 (Fig. 4b). Relapses involving 
subclones from more than one phylogenetic branch were evident in patients CRUK0080, 
CRUK0062 (Fig. 4a,c) and CRUK0041 (Extended Data Fig 5c).
Validation of phylogenetic characterization
To validate subclonal ctDNA analyses, data acquired from sequencing metastatic tissue at 
recurrence was integrated with M-seq primary tumor data (for biopsy details, Supplementary 
Table 3). Patient CRUK0063 suffered para-vertebral relapse of their NSCLC. Post-operative 
ctDNA analysis revealed the detection of the same subclonal SNV (OR5D18) on four 
consecutive occasions over a 231-day period (Extended Data Fig. 7a). The OR5D18 SNV 
traced back to a subclonal cluster private to primary tumor region three (Fig. 5a). CT-guided 
biopsy tissue was acquired from the para-vertebral metastasis at post-operative day 467. 
Exome sequencing of relapse tissue revealed the subclonal cluster containing the OR5D18 
SNV gave rise to the metastatic subclone (Fig. 5a), this supported ctDNA phylogenetic 
characterization of relapse. The para-vertebral biopsy contained 88 SNVs not called as 
present in the primary tumor including an ARID1A stop-gain driver SNV. Re-examination 
of primary tumor region M-Seq data with a lower SNV calling threshold revealed that 16 of 
88 SNVs, including ARID1A, were detectable in primary tumor region three, compared to a 
maximum of 2 of 88 in other tumor regions (Extended Data Fig. 7b). These data suggest that 
ctDNA profiling can resolve the primary tumor region from which a low frequency 
metastatic subclone derives. CRUK0035 developed two liver and one adrenal metastases 
(Fig. 5b). Sequencing of the metastatic liver deposit revealed that only 109 of 149 SNVs 
classed as clonal in the primary tumor were detectable in the metastasis. This was suggestive 
of an ancestral branching event not resolved through primary M-seq analysis (Fig 5b). Post-
operative ctDNA profiling identified clonal SNVs present in the liver metastasis biopsy but 
also revealed SNVs representing a subclone from the primary tumor (Extended Data Fig 7c). 
This subclone was not present in the metastatic liver deposit (Fig 5b). These data may reflect 
ctDNA identified from the non-biopsied metastases suggesting multiple metastatic events. 
CRUK0044 suffered a vertebral and right hilar relapse. Post-operatively the same subclonal 
SNV (OR10K1), was detected in ctDNA on two occasions 85 days apart (Extended Data 
Fig. 7d). This SNV was represented in a single subclone detected through sequencing hilar 
lymph-node metastatic tissue, supporting ctDNA findings (Fig. 5c). CRUK0041 suffered an 
intracerebral, hilar and subcarinal lymph node relapse. Four subclonal SNVs representing

 both branches of the tumor phylogenetic tree were detectable in ctDNA at relapse. 
Consistent with these data, sequencing of subcarinal metastatic tissue revealed the presence 
of subclonal SNVs mapping to both phylogenetic branches (Fig 5d, Extended Data Fig. 7e). 
Patient CRUK0013 had detectable ctDNA 3 and 38 days post-operatively. Following 
adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for lymph-node metastases identified in the pathological 
specimen, ctDNA levels became undetectable (Fig 4h). Two involved lymph-nodes were 
sampled for exome analysis together with M-seq of the primary tumor. Four subclonal SNVs 
detected in ctDNA post-operatively mapped to an ancestral subclone (describing a subclone 
that existed during the tumor’ s evolution) (Extended Data Fig. 7f). This ancestral subclone 
contained a KRAS amplification (>15 copies, triploid background) and was identified as 
present in primary tumor and sampled lymph-nodes by M-Seq (Fig. 5e). These data provide 
phylogenetic characterization of post-operative residual disease that responded to adjuvant 
chemoradiotherapy (Fig. 4h).
ctDNA profiling in the metastatic setting
Patient CRUK0063 underwent examination through the PEACE post-mortem study 24 hours 
following death. M-Seq data from the six post-mortem tumor regions (para-aortic, para-
vertebral and lung metastases, day 857), the para-vertebral relapse biopsy (day 467) and five 
primary tumor regions (day 0) were combined to infer the phylogenetic structure of this 
patient’ s NSCLC (Fig. 6a). All seven metastatic tumor regions arose from a single ancestral 
subclone represented by phylogenetic cluster 8. Six metastatic regions shared a later 
phylogenetic origin, cluster 12 (Fig. 6b). The single tumor region not containing 
phylogenetic cluster 12 was sampled from the para-aortic metastasis at autopsy and 
contained a private subclone represented by phylogenetic cluster 9 (Fig. 6b).
We designed a bespoke ctDNA assay-panel to retrospectively track metastatic subclonal 
burden. 20 clonal SNVs and a median of 8 subclonal SNVs (range 4 to 15) in each of 9 
metastatic subclonal clusters were targeted by the assay-panel (Extended Data Fig. 8). Since 
103 variants per time-point were profiled, SNV detection thresholds were increased to 
maintain platform specificity (see Methods). This resulted in a predicted false positive rate 
(FPR) of 0.0011 translating to a 10.7% risk of a single false-positive SNV at each time point 
and a 0.5% risk of 2 false-positive SNVs at each time point when testing 103 SNVs.
Two clonal SNVs were detected by the 103 SNV assay-panel at day 151 post-surgery (Fig 
6c, Extended Data Fig. 8), 189 days prior to the time point ctDNA was detected using the 19 
SNV assay-panel in Figure 4f. At day 242 a single subclonal SNV was detected from 
phylogenetic cluster 8 (Fig 6c, Extended Data Fig. 8), within the context of a 10.7% false-
positive risk a single SNV call could represent type I error. At day 466, following clinical-
relapse at the thoracic para-vertebral site, 18 of 20 SNVs mapping to phylogenetic clusters 
(8,11 and 12) were detected in ctDNA, these subclonal clusters were shared between six of 
seven metastatic sites (Fig 6b-c, Extended Data Fig. 8). Single SNVs from two private 
subclones (phylogenetic cluster 5 and 9) were also detectable in ctDNA at day 466 (Fig 6c, 
Extended Data Fig. 8). These subclones were not identified in the CT guided para-vertebral 
biopsy taken at day 467 (Fig. 6b). The mean plasma VAF of the SNVs detected in 
phylogenetic clusters 11, 8, 12, 9 and 5 mirrored their proximity to the clonal cluster (light

 blue) in the M-Seq derived phylogenetic tree (Fig. 6a,c). This suggested a tiered burden of 
subclonal disease concordant with M-seq phylogenetic inferences. Mean clonal VAF fell in 
response to palliative radiotherapy and chemotherapy, but at day 767 increased (Fig. 6c). 
Single SNVs mapping to phylogenetic clusters 5 and 9 and two SNVs mapping to 
phylogenetic cluster 2 were now detectable in ctDNA 90 days before death (Fig. 6a-c, 
Extended Data Fig 8). These three phylogenetic clusters represented subclones private to the 
para-aortic metastases (Fig 6. a-b). Consistent with these data significant para-aortic 
progression was observed at post-mortem compared with most recent CT imaging 
performed 112 days before death - which showed no evidence of para-aortic disease.
Discussion
In summary, we find predictors of ctDNA detection in early-stage NSCLC characterized by 
non-adenocarcinoma histology, necrosis, increased proliferative indices and lymphovascular 
invasion. Triple negative breast cancers display necrosis19, high proliferative indices20,21 
and are associated with increased ctDNA levels compared with other breast cancer 
subtypes6 suggesting extension of these observations beyond NSCLC.
Tumour volume correlated with the mean plasma VAF of clonal SNVs in ctDNA-positive 
NSCLCs (Fig 3a.). A primary NSCLC tumour volume of 10 cm3 predicted a ctDNA plasma 
VAF of 0.1%. The sensitivity of the multiplex-PCR NGS platform was in excess of 99% at 
VAFs of 0.1% and above, suggesting optimum platform sensitivity with tumour burdens in 
excess of 10 cm3. Low-dose CT lung screening can identify lung nodules with diameters 
from 4mm22. Assuming a spherical nodule this would translate to a tumor volume of 
0.034cm3. Based on the relationship between tumor volume and ctDNA plasma VAF 
observed in this study a tumor volume of 0.034cm3 would equate to a plasma VAF of 1.8 x 
10-4 % (95% CI, 9.8 x 10-6 to 0.0033%), at the extreme of detection limits of current ctDNA 
platforms23. Sensitivity of clonal SNV ctDNA directed early NSCLC screening may 
therefore be constrained by tumor size using current technologies.
A limitation to targeted ctDNA profiling is cost, estimated at $1750 per patient for 
sequencing a single tumor region, synthesis of a patient-specific assay-panel and profiling of 
five plasma samples. Adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy in NSCLC improves cure rates 
following surgery in only 5% of patients and 20% patients receiving chemotherapy 
experience acute toxicities3. There is a need to increase adjuvant therapy efficacy and better 
target its use. Bespoke ctDNA profiling can characterize the subclonal dynamics of relapsing 
NSCLC and identify adjuvant chemotherapy resistance. These findings indicate that drug 
development guided by ctDNA platforms to identify residual disease, define adjuvant 
treatment response and target emerging subclones prior to clinical recurrence in NSCLC, 
with appropriate CLIA validation, are now feasible.

Tissue microarrays (TMAs) were created of 100 NSCLC cases for Ki67+ 
immunohistochemistry. Representative tumor areas were defined by examination of H&E 
stained sections from all 100 tissues blocks. From each NSCLC case two 2mm cores were 
selected from different regions within each specimen and re-embedded in recipient blocks, 
resulting in a TMA of 200 cores with four normal lung cores as negative control. 2-5µm 
sections from tissue-microarrays containing tumor were cut. Immunohistochemistry with 
anti-Ki67 monoclonal antibody (Dilution 1:100; clone MIB-1; DAKO Agilent Technologies 
LDA, UK Limited, Stockport, Cheshire SK8 3GR, UK) was performed using BenchMark 
Ultra (Ventana/Roche). The percentage of Ki67 positive cells were averaged across two 
tumor sections for each case. Detection was performed using the peroxidase-based detection 
reagent conjugate (OptiView DAB IHC Detection Kit; Ventana Medical Systems, Inc).
Central histopathological review
Digital images of tumor sections from all cases were reviewed in detail centrally by at least 
one pathologist, and in cases of uncertainty, by two. Percentage of necrosis and the presence 
of lymphovascular invasion were all evaluated on digital images from scanned diagnostic 
slides blinded to the ctDNA detection status of the patient in question.
Central radiology review & volume estimation
92 of 96 anonymized diagnostic PET-CT were retrospectively reviewed by a Nuclear 
Medicine Physician, blinded to the initial PET-CT reports. Scan images were not available in 
three cases (CRUK0025, CRUK0039 and CRUK0023) and in one case a pre-operative PET-
CT was not performed (CRUK0082). CT and PET images were matched and fused into 
transaxial, coronal and sagittal images and reviewed on a dedicated PET/CT software 
visualizer (AW 4.1/4.2 GE medical systems). The semi-quantitative parameter Standardized 
Uptake Value (SUV) max for the primary tumor mass was calculated and recorded along 
with SUVmax of mediastinal background uptake. Tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) was 
calculated based on SUVmax of the tumor divided by mediastinal background uptake24,25. 
Tumor volume was determined based on tumor CT scans. CT slices of the primary tumor 
were measured with 3D Slicer applying the “lung algorithm window” settings, tumor 
contours were segmented on each axial CT slice. These steps were performed by an

 experienced resident (W.L.B.), and all contours were confirmed and edited where necessary, 
by a radiologist with 14 years of experience in cancer imaging (F.M.F.). Effective tumor 
volume was defined as tumor volume multiplied with the mean purity of the tumor based on 
M-seq, purity estimates derived from ASCAT analysis as described9. Effective subclone size 
was defined as mean cancer cell fraction (CCF) across the regions of the mutation cluster 
multiplied by tumor volume and mean tumor purity.
DNA extraction & quantification
For cell-free DNA (cfDNA) extraction, blood samples were collected in K2 EDTA tubes. 
Samples were processed within 2 hours of collection by double spinning of blood first at 10 
minutes at 1000g then plasma 10 minutes at 2000g. Plasma was stored in 1ml aliquots at – 
80°C. Up to 5ml of plasma per case was available for this study (range 1-5ml, median 5 ml). 
The entire volume of plasma was used for cfDNA extraction. cfDNA was extracted using the 
QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid kit (Qiagen) and eluted into 50 µl DNA Suspension 
Buffer (Sigma). The purified cfDNA was stored at -20°C until use. Genomic DNA was 
extracted from each tumor region as described9. Every cfDNA sample was QCed and 
quantified on the Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity (Agilent) using a standard curve generated 
from pre-quantified mono-nucleosomal DNA samples. Plasma cfDNA consists of a main 
mono-nucleosomal peak (~160 bp); for some samples, di-nucleosomal and tri-nucleosomal 
peaks are visible (at ~320 bp and ~500 bp, respectively). The library prep method used 
selectively amplifies the mono-nucleosomal fraction of cfDNA.
Exome sequencing and processing
Whole exome sequencing was performed on DNA purified from tumor tissue and normal 
blood as described9, with the exception of CRUK0063_BR_T1-R1. This capture was 
performed according to the manufacturer’ s 200 ng DNA protocol (Agilent). Annotated SNV 
calls are available in Supplementary Table 3 in Jamal-Hanjani et al. 20179. For this study, 
one relapse sample was acquired through metastatic tissue biopsies from each of four 
patients (CRUK0035, CRUK0041, CRUK0044, CRUK0063). Additionally, six metastatic 
samples were acquired at post mortem examination of CRUK0063. Genomic DNA was 
purified from all tissue samples, and processed through the TRACERx bioinformatics 
pipeline as described9. Annotated SNV calls are available in Supplementary Table 4.
SNV assay design
The Natera assay design pipeline was used to generate forward and reverse PCR primers for 
all somatic SNVs detected in tumor samples. The assays were combined into pools such that 
any primer pair in a pool is not predicted to form primer dimers. In this way 10 balanced 
pools were created, each containing the assays for 10 patients’  SNVs. For each patient, 
assays were prioritized such that, 1) assays covering driver SNVs had highest priority, and 2) 
there was uniform sampling of phylogenetic tree. For the longitudinal cohort, up to 10 extra 
assays were generated for adenocarcinoma samples. SNV assays were ordered from IDT 
(Coralville, IA) as individual oligos in 96-well plates, desalted and normalized to 100 µM 
each. The oligos were pooled according to the pooling strategy previously described10 and 
each pool was QC-ed by running the multiplex PCR and sequencing protocol using one 
plasma cfDNA library from a healthy subject. For each pool, the sequencing data was

 analyzed to determine the amount of primer-dimer reads and to identify drop-out assays. 
Primers contributing to dimer formation were removed from each final pool.
Analytical validation
Synthetic spikes representing twenty SNVs randomly selected from Pool 1 were designed 
and synthesized (IDT, Coralville, IA) as 160 bp oligos with the respective SNV placed in the 
middle (position 80). These synthetic spikes were mixed at equimolar ratios and used to 
prepare a library. This library was titrated into a library prepared from mono-nucleosomal 
DNA (10,000 copies) from a normal cell line (AG16778 from Coriell, Camden, NJ). The 
library of 20 synthetic spikes was titrated into the mononucleosomal DNA library at 2.5%, 
0.5%, 0.25%, 0.1%, 0.05% and 0% (each in triplicate), and 0.01%, 0.005% and 0.001% 
(each in quadruplicate. Because preparing spiked samples at such low levels is either subject 
to sampling noise (0.01% spikes into 10,000 genomic copies background is equivalent to 
one mutant copy), or is not possible (at levels less than 0.01%), samples were mixed as 
libraries. Following library mixing and sequencing, data was analyzed to detect all the 
targets in Pool 1 using the same parameters as used for the patient samples. Targets that had 
a depth of read less than the threshold were not analyzed. The measured VAF of each spike 
for the samples with 2.5% nominal input was used to calculate an input correction factor 
(measured VAF/2.5%); that was applied to the other inputs of the corresponding spike 
titration series. The measured VAF differed from the nominal input most likely because the 
mononucleosomal fragmentation pattern is not entirely random. Because of this, the actual 
input levels differ from the nominal input levels, and the sensitivity is measured based on 
corrected input intervals (chosen such that there are a meaningful number of samples in each 
interval). Sensitivity of >99% at SNV input frequencies down to 0.1% was achieved (199 
SNVs detected out of 201 eligible positive positions), with a specificity of 99.6% for all 
negative SNV positions (19 false positive SNVs called out of 5099 eligible positions).
Plasma SNV mPCR-NGS workflow
Forty microliters of the extracted cfDNA from each case was used as input into library 
preparation using the Natera Library Prep Kit. All purified libraries were QC-ed on the 
LabChip GX 5k DNA chip. Successful libraries had a single peak at ~250 bp. The amplified 
libraries were then analyzed by mPCR-NGS. Optimal mPCR conditions were as described. 
Each PCR assay pool was used to amplify the SNV targets from the 10 corresponding 
samples and 20 negative control samples (plasma libraries prepared from healthy subjects). 
Each amplicon pool was sequenced on one Illumina HiSeq 2500 Rapid Run with 50 cycles 
paired-end reads using the Illumina Paired End v1 kit with an average target DOR of 
~40,000 per assay.
Plasma SNV calling algorithm
The set of SNVs covered by the assays in a pool were considered as target SNVs for the 
corresponding sequencing run. Target assays with <1000 reads in the plasma samples were 
considered failed and were not analyzed further. At each SNV position, an error model was 
built using all of the 20 negative control samples plus the cancer samples that were not 
expected to contain that particular SNV (based on tumor-tissue sequencing). Samples with 
high plasma VAF (>20%) among the putative negatives were considered to have possible

 germline mutation and were excluded from the error model. A confidence score was 
calculated for each target SNV based on the error model. A positive plasma SNV call was 
made if the confidence score for that mutation in the corresponding plasma sample passed 
our confidence threshold. The SNVs called positive in plasma samples that were not 
expected to contain the given SNVs were considered ‘ false positive’ , the false positive rate 
under these conditions was 0.24%. Notably, there was no difference in depth of read 
between called and not called SNVs (Extended Data Fig 1c). New assays were designed for 
CRUK0063 based on M-seq of metastatic biopsy retrieved at day 467 and of metastatic 
lesions harvested post mortem. A total of 103 assays were designed compared to 19 based 
on the primary tumor alone. An updated error threshold was designed to control for false 
positives by using the original threshold to make SNV calls on the negative samples in the 
run; the rate of calls were measured and defined as false-positives. This false positive rate 
was then applied to the number of eligible positions in the positive samples. This was 
repeated with more stringent thresholds until the expected number of false positives in the 
eligible positions becomes ~1. All multiplex PCR-NGS ctDNA SNV assays are available in 
Supplementary Table 5 (Baseline, pre-operative cohort assays), Supplementary Table 6 
(Longitudinal Assays), and Supplementary Table 7 (Extended Longitudinal Assays for 
CRUK0063).
Cross-platform validation using generic PCR-NGS panel section
Cross-platform validation was performed in 28 patients with M-Seq confirmed SNV(s) 
within one or more hotspots targeted by a generic multiplex PCR-NGS panel (Extended 
Table 2a-b, Supplementary Table 8). 20ng of isolated cfDNA was used for library 
preparation using the Oncomine™ Lung cfDNA Assay (ThermoFisher Scientific), according 
to the manufacturer’ s instructions. Automated template preparation and chip loading was 
conducted on the Ion Chef™ instrument using the Ion 520™ & Ion 530™ Kit-Chef 
(ThermoFisher Scientific). Ultimately, samples were sequenced on Ion 530™ chips using 
the Ion S5™ System (ThermoFisher Scientific). Sequencing data was accessed on the 
Torrent suite v5.2.2. Reads were aligned against the human genome (hg19) using Alignment 
v4.0-r77189, and variants were called using the coverage Analysis v4.0-r77897 plugin. All 
18 bespoke-panel ctDNA negative patients had no tumor SNVs detectable in plasma pre-
operatively by the generic panel supporting biological specificity of the bespoke targeted 
approach, 7 of 10 bespoke-panel ctDNA positive patients had tumor SNVs detected in 
plasma by the generic panel (Extended Table 2a-b). SNVs detected by hotspot panel not 
identified by M-Seq are displayed in Extended Table 2c.
Processing and phylogenetic analysis of relapse and primary tumor multiregion whole 
exome data
Biopsies from multiple regions from the primary tumor (n=327), metastatic biopsies (n=4) 
and matching blood germline samples (n=100) were subjected to multi-region whole exome 
sequencing and analysis including estimation of copy number, purity and ploidy, and 
phylogenetic tree construction as described9. Briefly, phylogenetic analysis was performed 
based on CCF determined for SNVs and clustered across tumor regions using a modified 
version of Pyclone9 into clusters with similar CCF values, filtered and processed as 
described9. Mutation clusters are assumed to represent tumor subclones, either current or

 ancestral, and are used as input for construction of phylogenetic relationship. Phylogenetic 
trees were primarily constructed using the published tool CITUP (0.1.0)26. However, in a 
small number of cases, including all relapse/autopsy cases, manual tree construction was 
required and performed as described9. Complete detail of primary tumor tree construction 
can be found in Jamal-Hanjani et al. 20179. Relapse tree construction was performed as 
follow: CRUK0063: clustering was performed twice, once across 5 primary tumor regions 
and once across 5 primary, 1 relapse, and 6 autopsy regions. To ensure consistency, when 
deriving a phylogenetic tree based on all tumor regions, CCF clusters based on clustering 
only the primary tumor regions were maintained for mutations not involved in metastatic 
relapse. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on 17 mutation clusters. CRUK0035: 
Clustering primary tumor regions with the relapse region revealed one cluster private to the 
relapse, and one cluster shared with the relapse and all other regions. CRUK0044: Clustering 
primary tumor regions with the relapse region revealed a cluster private to the relapse, 
descended from a cluster private to region 1 in the primary tumor. CRUK0041: Clustering 
primary tumor regions with the relapse region revealed cluster 4 as private to the relapse. 
This cluster must have evolved from cluster 3 only found in the relapse and in region 4. A 
private cluster 6 in region 4 must have evolved from cluster 4. However, this conflicts with 
clusters 2 and 5, found in the relapse and regions 1-3, but not region 4. This can be 
reconciled by assuming a polyclonal relapse, seeded primarily from regions 1-3, but with 
some contribution from cluster 3, private to region 4. Cluster data is available in 
Supplementary Table 4 under “PyClonePhyloCluster”.
Statistical data analysis
Analysis was performed in the R statistical environment version 3.2.3 and SPSS version 24. 
All statistical tests were two-sided unless expressly stated. Multivariate logistic regression 
used detection of ctDNA (the dependent variable) classified as detection of 2 or more 
patient-specific variants in ctDNA and the covariates listed in Supplementary Table 1. All 
predictors were entered simultaneously into the regression. All continuous independent 
variables were found to be linearly related to the logit of the dependent variable (assessed 
via the Box-Tidwell procedure). The logistic regression model was statistically significant, 
X2(10) = 81.35, P<0.001 and the Hosmer-Lemeshow P value was 0.9858 indicating that the 
model was not a poor fit. To determine the ability of PET TBR to predict whether or not 
tumor ctDNA was identified in plasma, PET TBR estimates were analyzed by ROC curve 
analysis against binary detection of ctDNA in plasma at baseline based on at least two 
variants detected, significance test based on Wilcoxon rank sum test. For analysis involving 
longitudinally detected variants (Figure 4, Extended Figure 5), only subclonal variants from 
pyclone clusters present in phylogenetic trees were displayed, this did not affect ctDNA 
detection status of any time-points. In non-relapse cases presented in Extended Data Fig 6 
all detected subclonal SNVs were plotted. To determine the relationship between tumor 
volume and ctDNA VAF, ctDNA assays against clonal SNVs were selected. For each 
patient, the mean ctDNA VAF of the clonal SNVs was determined as baseline for 38/46 
patients with at least 2 SNVs detected in plasma. As detailed in Extended Fig. 4c, 9/46 
patients were not included in the analysis: CRUK0036 had no pre-op CT scan available, 
CRUK0087 and CRUK0096 had a large cavity inside the primary cancer, CRUK0099 had a 
collapsed lung making volume assessment inaccurate, CRUK0100, CRUK0077, CRUK0052

 had a CT slice spacing of > 5 mm, and finally CRUK0088 and CRUK0091 had a total tumor 
volume < 3.5 cm3. Linear regression was performed on log-transformed mean VAF and 
tumor volume. The log transformation was justified as it symmetrized the residuals in the 
model. An independent analysis was performed where tumor volume was multiplied with 
tumor purity to estimate the cancer cell volume. The same log transformation and analysis 
was applied to data acquired from Newman et al.16, where ctDNA VAF was determined 
based on CAPP-seq analysis with matched tumor volume data available. To analyze clone 
size versus ctDNA VAF for subclonal SNVs, the mean CCF of the mutations within a 
subclonal mutation cluster was multiplied with tumor volume, and as a second independent 
analysis, with tumor purity.

 Table 2a
Cross platform validation using a generic approach to 
ctDNA profiling
Bespoke panel detected NSCLCs - cross platform validation
a) 7/10 (70%) of bespoke-panel ctDNA positive patients had tumor SNVs detectable in 
plasma preoperatively by a generic hotspot PCR-NGS lung panel (Lung Oncomine, 
Thermofisher). The three bespoke-panel ctDNA positive patients undetected by the generic 
panel had mean clonal plasma variant allele frequencies lower than the 0.1% plasma variant 
allele frequency (VAF) limit of detection reported for the generic panel (shaded yellow). b) 
Based on CT volumetric assessment of each patient’ s primary tumor we predicted plasma 
VAF corresponding to a tumor of that size (see Figure 3 and Methods for details of 
approach). This allowed us to infer platform sensitivities for each patient within the 
bespoke-panel non-detected cohort. Six LUADs (shaded green; CRUK0037, CRUK0051, 
CRUK0004, CRUK0039, CRUK0025 and CRUK0048) had tumor volumes approximating 
to a plasma VAF of more than 0.1%. This suggested that these tumors resided within the top 
platform sensitivity bracket of both the generic and bespoke-panel ctDNA platforms. No 
ctDNA was detected by either platform in these cases, suggesting biological specificity of 
the bespoke-panel.

 Figure 1. Phylogenetic ctDNA tracking
Overview of the study methodology. Multi-region sequencing of NSCLC was performed as 
part of the TRACERx study. PCR assay-panels were designed based on phylogenetic 
analysis, targeting clonal and subclonal single nucleotide variants to facilitate non-invasive 
tracking of the patient-specific tumor phylogeny. Assay-panels were combined into 
multiplex assay-pools containing primers from up to 10 patients. Cell-free DNA was 
extracted from pre- and post-operative plasma samples and multiplex-PCR performed, 
followed by sequencing of amplicons. Findings were integrated with M-Seq exome data to 
track tumor evolution.

 Figure 3. Tumor volume predicts plasma variant allele frequency
a) Tumor volume (cm3) measured by CT volumetric analysis correlates with mean clonal 
plasma VAF, n=37, grey vertical lines represent range of clonal VAF, red shading indicates 
95% confidence intervals. b) Predicted mean clonal VAF at hypothetical volumes ranging 
from 1 to 100cm3 based on model in panel a, predicted cancer cell number based on model 
in extended data 4e. c) Estimated effective subclone size, defined as mean CCF of subclone 
multiplied by tumor volume and purity, influences subclonal SNV detection. For negative 
calls, median effective subclone size was 1.70 cm3, range= 0.21-24.11, n=163, for positive 
calls, median effective subclone size = 4.06 cm3, range = 0.31 – 49.20, n=109. Wilcoxon 
rank sum test, P<0.001, data from 34 patients (passed volumetric filters with subclonal 
SNVs represented in assay-panel). d) Estimated effective subclone size correlates with 
subclonal plasma VAF, n=109 subclonal SNVs, data from 34 patients (passed volumetric 
filters with detected subclonal SNVs in plasma).

 Figure 4. Post-operative ctDNA detection predicts and characterizes NSCLC relapse
a-h) Longitudinal cell-free DNA profiling. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) detection in 
plasma was defined as the detection of two tumor-specific SNVs. Detected clonal (circles, 
light blue) and subclonal (triangles, colors indicates different subclones) SNVs from each 
patient-specific assay-panel are plotted on graphs colored by M-Seq derived tumor 
phylogenetic nodes. Mean clonal (blue) and mean subclonal (red) plasma VAF are indicated 
on graphs as connected lines. Pre-operative and relapse M-Seq derived phylogenetic trees 
represented by ctDNA are illustrated above each graph.

 Figure 5. Phylogenetic trees incorporating relapse tissue sequencing data
Phylogenetic trees based on mutations found in primary and metastatic tissue (a-d), or 
primary tumor and lymph node biopsies (e). Colored nodes in phylogenetic trees indicate 
cancer clones harboring mutations assayed for in ctDNA, grey indicates a clone not assayed. 
Branch length is proportional to number of mutations unless crossed. Dashed red lines show 
branches leading to metastatic relapse. Colored bars below show the number of assays per 
sample detected preoperatively and at relapse (a-d) or in the absence of relapse, post-surgery
