andomized clinical trials established a survival benefit 
of primary prevention implantable cardioverter defi-
brillators (ICDs) in patients with heart failure (HF) and 
reduced ejection fraction (EF).1–3 However, these trials gen-
erally enrolled a majority of men and were underpowered 
to assess benefits in the smaller subset of women, which 
represented 10% to 30% of enrolled subjects. Some experts 
have questioned whether primary prevention ICDs provide 
benefit to women and have raised substantial concerns on 
under-representation of women in clinical trials for devices.4 
Nonetheless, the results of these trials were assumed in 
national guidelines to apply to otherwise eligible patients 
regardless of sex.5 Despite sex neutral guideline recommen-
dations, the actual use of primary prevention ICDs is lower 
in women versus men,6 and 1 possible explanation for this 
may be concerns on the paucity of evidence supporting pri-
mary prevention ICDs in women.
See Clinical Perspective
Ethical challenges make it unlikely that there will ever be 
a trial of primary prevention ICDs in women. As such, 2 meta-
analyses have been conducted to assess the impact of primary 
prevention ICDs on survival in women with benefit demon-
strated in one,7 but not in the other.8 Results in other post hoc 
and observational analyses of primary prevention ICDs in 
women have been mixed.9,10 However, conclusions from these 
studies were fundamentally limited because of study design 
leaving unanswered questions about the benefit of primary 
prevention ICDs in women. We previously compared survival 
of women with an ICD from the National Cardiovascular Data 
Registry ICD Registry to matched women without an ICD 
from Get With The Guidelines for Heart Failure (GWTG-HF), 
a voluntary hospital-based improvement program.11 We found 
that the presence of an ICD was associated with improved sur-
vival, and there was no evidence of an interaction between sex 
and the presence of an ICD with respect to survival. However, 
patients could not be matched based on hospital characteris-
tics, and this may have confounded the analysis.

Background—Clinical trials of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) for primary prevention enrolled a limited 
number of women. We sought to examine clinical practice data to compare survival rates among women with heart failure 
with or without a primary prevention ICD.
Methods and Results—We linked data from 264 US hospitals included in the Get With The Guidelines for Heart Failure 
registry with data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. From these sources, we propensity score 
matched 430 women with heart failure who received a primary prevention ICD to 430 women who did not; we further 
adjusted using a Cox proportional hazards model. Median follow-up was 3.4 and 3.0 years. For comparison, we matched 
859 men receiving an ICD with 859 who did not; median follow-up was 3.9 versus 2.9 years. In the matched cohorts, 
an ICD was associated with similarly better survival in women (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.66–0.92; 
P=0.003) and men (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.67–0.87 P<0.001). There was no interaction between 
sex and presence of an ICD with respect to survival (P=0.79).
Conclusions—Among patients with heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, a primary prevention 
ICD was associated with a significant survival advantage among women and among men. These findings support 
guideline-directed use of primary prevention ICDs in eligible patients.  (Circ Heart Fail. 2016;9:e002630.

In this analysis, we sought to compare survival between 
women hospitalized for HF and implanted with a primary pre-
vention ICD with eligible women from similar hospital set-
tings without an ICD implanted. We then compared this with 
similar matched analyses among men.
Methods
Data Sources
Data for this investigation were acquired from the GWTG-HF registry 
and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The GWTG-HF 
registry has been described previously.12 Briefly, it began in 2000 as 
a voluntary data collection and hospital-based quality improvement 
initiative. The HF module originated from the March 2005 Organized 
Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment of Patients Hospitalized 
with Heart Failure (OPTIMIZE-HF) study.13 All participating in-
stitutions are required to comply with local regulatory and privacy 
guidelines and, if required, to secure institutional review board ap-
proval. Because data were used primarily at the local site for quality 
improvement, sites were granted a waiver of informed consent under 
the common rule. Outcome, A Quintiles Company (Cambridge, MA), 
is the data collection and coordination center for the American Heart 
Association/American Stroke Association Get With The Guidelines 
programs, and the Duke Clinical Research Institute (Durham, NC) 
serves as the data analysis center. The Duke Clinical Research 
Institute has an agreement to analyze the aggregate deidentified data 
for research purposes. Hospital characteristics as well as patient de-
mographic and clinical characteristics including comorbidities, previ-
ous therapies and interventions, contraindications to evidence-based 
therapies, and in-hospital outcomes are collected prospectively. Data 
related to ICD therapy for each hospitalization include whether an 
ICD was present at admission, implanted during the hospitalization, 
or planned after hospital discharge; contraindications to ICD therapy, 
and any reason documented by a physician for not implanting or pre-
scribing an ICD.
Medicare data include Part A inpatient claims and the correspond-
ing denominator files for 2005 through 2012. We linked the regis-
try data to Medicare claims data using a validated method that uses 
combinations of indirect identifiers and identifies patients 91% of the 
time.14
Study Population
Heart failure admissions in the GWTG-HF registry were merged with 
Medicare Part A inpatient claims, matching by admission and dis-
charge dates, date of birth, sex, and hospital, using methodology pre-
viously described.14 These linked data were available for admissions 
from January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2012.
For the present analysis, the initial group of interest includ-
ed women in the GWTG-HF registry who were at least 65 years 
old, whose primary insurance was Medicare, and who were linked 
to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data as described 
above (n=58 742). From the analysis we sequentially excluded re-
cords of patients who died during hospital admission (n=2142); re-
ceived comfort care only (n=2953); were not discharged to home 
(n=17 809); already had an ICD in place (n=1868); were missing an 
left ventricular EF (LVEF) or medical history data (n=5398); had an 
LVEF >35% (n=20 821); or had a contraindication to ICD including 
recent onset of HF (ie, HF diagnosis not predating the index ad-
mission), recent myocardial infarction (within 40 days) or coronary 
revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary 
artery bypass grafting within 90 days), class IV HF symptoms, or 
no reasonable expectation of survival to 1 year (n=935); and those 
who received cardiac resynchronization therapy (n=720) because, 
in these cases, the effect of cardiac resynchronization therapy can-
not be distinguished from that of the ICD. Records of subsequent 
hospitalizations were also excluded (n=716). After these exclusions, 
3788 unique Medicare patients remained. Of these, 430 (11%) had 
an ICD implanted or prescribed during the index hospitalization, and 
this group made up the ICD population to which non-ICD patients 
were matched.
The same process was used to obtain a study sample of men 
(n=48 478), which resulted in 5273 unique Medicare patients; 863 of 
these had an ICD implanted or prescribed during the hospitalization.
Outcomes
All-cause mortality was the primary outcome of this analysis, deter-
mined from the Medicare denominator file through December 31, 
2012. Patients with no record of death in the denominator file were 
considered alive as of December 31, 2012, or the date at which the 
patient was no longer enrolled in Part A and Part B fee-for-service 
Medicare, whichever came first.
Statistical Analysis
We compared the baseline characteristics of women with and without 
an ICD using the Pearson χ2 test for categorical variables and the 
Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables. Summary statistics 
are reported as percentages for categorical variables and as medians 
and 25th and 75th percentiles for continuous variables. The standard-
ized difference between groups for each variable was defined as the 
absolute value of the difference in group means or proportions, di-
vided by the average SD and expressed as a percentage.
Significant differences between ICD and non-ICD patients were 
expected in this nonrandomized sample, and a preliminary examina-
tion of the data confirmed this. We used the methods of Rosenbaum 
and Rubin to develop matched groups.15 First, for continuous vari-
ables, we excluded non-ICD patients whose value was below the 
minimum or above the maximum for ICD patients. Second, miss-
ing data were imputed. Missing rates were generally low, but ≤15% 
of data on medications were missing. When a contraindication to 
the medication was noted, the value for that medication was set to 
0; otherwise missing data were imputed by using a single Markov 
chain Monte Carlo imputation. Third, a propensity model was 
built using logistic regression in which the dependent (outcome) 
variable was an indicator of whether each patient belonged to the 
group with an ICD or without an ICD, and the independent (pre-
dictor) variables were baseline characteristics including age; race 
(white versus other); LVEF; systolic blood pressure; medical his-
tory including ischemic heart disease, previous atrial arrhythmia 
(including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter), diabetes mellitus, 
hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, depression, chronic ob-
structive pulmonary disease or asthma, anemia, or previous cardio-
vascular attack/transient ischemic attack; medications at discharge 
including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin 
receptor blocker, β-blocker, calcium channel blocker, digoxin, di-
uretic, and statin; relevant laboratory values including hemoglobin, 
sodium, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and creatinine from ad-
mission when available and otherwise from discharge; and hospi-
tal characteristics including geographic region, teaching hospital, 
number of beds, and whether the hospital performs advanced car-
diac procedures. From the logistic regression model, an estimated 
propensity score (the probability [P] of being an ICD patient) and 
a corresponding logit for the propensity score (loge[P/(1−P)]) were 
calculated for each patient.
Fourth, for the matching process, a caliper width of 0.25*(SD of 
the logit) was used. For a given patient with an ICD, all patients with-
out an ICD were considered whose logit differed from the ICD pa-
tient’s logit by less than the caliper width. Among these patients, the 
patient without an ICD with the shortest Mahalanobis distance from 
the ICD patient was selected as a match. Variables used in calculat-
ing the Mahalanobis distance were all significant predictors from the 
propensity model. Each patient without an ICD was matched no more 
than once; there were no patients with an ICD left unmatched. These 
procedures were repeated to develop a subgroup of men.
A Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the as-
sociation of the presence of an ICD with the risk of all-cause mor-
tality among the matched patients. The model included all women 
and men, a term for sex, and a term for the interaction between sex

and presence of an ICD. Because the patient cohorts were matched, 
the unadjusted results are considered the primary results. A robust 
sandwich variance estimator was used to account for correlation 
among patients at the same hospital. The proportional hazards as-
sumption for the ICD term was assessed and determined to have 
been met. As a sensitivity analysis, to determine whether residual 
confounding affected the estimates, the model was repeated ad-
justing for all variables in the propensity model and stratified by 
quartile of propensity score. Missing values of covariates were im-
puted using multiple imputation. Risk relationships are expressed 
as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) within 
the subgroups of women and men derived from each Cox model. 
Mortality rates at 1 and 3 years are presented as Kaplan–Meier esti-
mates in the primary results and as predicted (adjusted) rates in the 
sensitivity results.
Differences were declared to be statistically significant at P<0.05, 
and all statistical tests were 2 sided. For all analyses, SAS version 9.2 
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used.
Preliminary examination of the primary outcome data demon-
strated early separation in survival curves between the groups of 
patients with and without an ICD. We explored whether excluding 
patients who died in the first 30 days after hospitalization would 
 
reduce this effect. A landmark model was performed beginning 30 
days after discharge, which resulted in omission of 29 ICD patients 
(2%) and all similar patients without an ICD (n=343; 4%). The sam-
ples were rematched, and the Cox model was recreated.
Results
Baseline Characteristics
The unmatched baseline characteristics of women from 
GWTG-HF with and without an ICD are shown in Table 1. 
A similar table for men is included in Appendix I in the Data 
Supplement. Compared with women with HF and no ICD, 
those with an ICD were younger and were more likely to 
have been admitted to a larger teaching hospital. The rates of 
comorbid conditions including ischemic heart disease, dia-
betes mellitus, hypertension, renal failure, depression, and 
history of stroke, or transient ischemic attack were similar 
between the 2 groups. After propensity score matching, the 
differences between groups were smaller (Table 2; Figure 1) 
with an absolute standardized difference on all variables 
<10%. In this group, 64% of patients received an ICD during 
the index admission with the remaining patients (36%) being 
prescribed an ICD on discharge. Matching in the subgroup of 
men achieved absolute standardized differences on all vari-
ables ≤10% (Figure 1).
Mortality
The median follow-up was 3.4 and 3.0 years, respectively, for 
the propensity-matched groups of women with and without 
an ICD. The overall risk of mortality was significantly lower 
in women with an ICD than in those without an ICD (HR, 
0.78; 95% CI, 0.66–0.92; P=0.003). This mortality difference 
appeared early and persisted throughout follow-up with mor-
tality at 3 years of 40.2% in the group with an ICD and 48.7% 
in the group without an ICD (Table 3; Figure 2A). A similar 
survival benefit was seen in the propensity-matched group 
of men with an ICD when compared with those without an 
ICD (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.067–0.087; P<0.001; Table 3; Fig-
ure 2B). A test for interaction demonstrated that improved sur-
vival associated with implantation of an ICD did not depend 
on sex (P=0.79).

 4  Zeitler et al  Primary Prevention ICDs in Women 
To further adjust for small remaining imbalances 
between groups, the primary propensity-matched results 
were adjusted for the covariates listed in Table 2. In this 
propensity-matched and adjusted model, the risk of mortal-
ity in women with an ICD compared with those without an 
ICD was nearly identical to the primary propensity-matched 
results (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.63–0.90; P=0.002; Table 3). 
This was also true in men (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.67–0.86; 
P<0.001; Table 3).
In a 30-day landmark analysis, we removed early deaths. 
Even after removing those with early mortality, the pro-
pensity-matched mortality HR was nearly identical to that 
observed in the primary analysis (0.80 for women and 0.81 
for men; Table 3).
Finally, we conducted a survival analysis in women and 
men in which all patients with an ICD, including those with 
an ICD at the time of HF hospitalization, were included in 
the ICD group. Although the survival benefits were attenuated

Discussion
Our study found that in both older women and men with HF 
and reduced LVEF, implantation or prescription of a primary 
prevention ICD on discharge was associated with improved 
survival. Relative to those not receiving an ICD, those receiv-
ing (or prescribed) an ICD had similarly improved survival in 
both women and men, with no significant sex-based interac-
tions. These HRs are similar to those seen overall in the Sud-
den Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial (SCD-HeFT; HR for 
mortality in ICD versus placebo groups, 0.77), which, among 
the landmark randomized clinical trials of primary prevention 
ICDs, most closely resembles the population studied here.1
Despite the survival benefits of primary prevention ICDs 
in patients with HF demonstrated in randomized clinical tri-
als, benefit in the subgroup of women from these trials has 
not been definitively proved.7–9 This uncertainty on survival 
benefit may be one of several contributing factors to the lower 
rates of ICD referral and implantation in eligible women.6,16,17 
Indeed, in this cohort, only 11% of eligible women and 16% 
of eligible men received an ICD or a prescription for one at the 
time of HF hospitalization. These low rates are consistent with 
other investigations, which found underutilization of ICDs.18,19 
In the absence of an adequately powered analysis from a ran-
domized clinical trial, we previously compared survival of 
women with an ICD from the National Cardiovascular Data 
Registry ICD Registry to matched women without an ICD 
from GWTG-HF.11 The survival benefit of a primary preven-
tion ICD for women was similar to that seen in this analysis, 
but we were unable to match for certain patient and hospital 
characteristics resulting in possible confounding. Moreover, 
the cohort size of women with a primary prevention ICD stud-
ied in this analysis (and our previous investigation) is greater 
than any examined in a randomized clinical trial.
In this analysis, we matched women hospitalized for HF 
who were eligible for a primary prevention ICD and either 
received one (or were prescribed one on discharge) or did not 
receive one. Given the observational nature of these data, we 
used propensity score matching to create groups that were as 
similar as possible using a model that included variables rep-
resenting demographic and clinical patient characteristics, as 
well as characteristics of the hospital in which patients were 
treated for HF. Notably, hospital characteristics were simi-
lar after matching (Table 2; Figure 1) differing by ≤2% on 
geographic region, teaching versus nonteaching, size, and 
availability of advanced cardiac procedures. This indicates 
that each woman with an ICD was generally compared with 
a woman without an ICD from a similar hospital; therefore, 
hospital site does not explain differences in survival.
Importantly, the survival curves in this analysis separated 
early (Figure 2). In part, this may be because of the high event 
rates observed in this population based on relatively older age 
and more comorbidities than clinical trial patients.20 In addi-
tion, patients in this analysis were necessarily identified based 
on a HF hospitalization, which has been associated with worse 
outcomes in Medicare patients.21,22 Indeed, when the ben-
efits of a primary prevention ICD have been examined in the 
sickest subgroup of patients in clinical trials, a similar finding 
of early curve separation has been seen as in the case of New 
York Heart Association class III patients in SCD-HeFT and

Defibrillators in Non-Ischemic Cardiomyopathy Treatment 
Evaluation (DEFINITE) trials.1,2 However, to fully investigate 
early curves separation in this context, we performed a 30-day 
landmark analysis to examine the effect of early deaths on the 
survival curves (Table 3). Exclusion of patients who died early 
simply delayed the early separation of curves by 30 days. This 
suggests that the differences in survival were not explained by a 
lead time bias.
Investigation of the mortality benefit of a primary preven-
tion ICD in women has been ongoing because the landmark 
clinical trials did not answer this question definitively. Various 
retrospective, post hoc, registry-based, and meta-analytic 
studies have sought to answer this question and have arrived 
at varying results.7–10 In light of this controversy, providers, 
professional societies, guideline committees, regulators, and 
others have assumed that, on average, the potential benefit of 
a primary prevention ICD in women outweighs the associated 
risks. Therefore, there is insufficient equipoise to justify a ran-
domized controlled clinical trial, and in the absence of such a 
trial, analyses of nonrandomized clinical cohorts such as this 
are important to inform clinical decision making.
Although this analysis and others demonstrate a mortality 
benefit for women from a primary prevention ICD, this benefit 
must be weighed against potential risks. This is particularly 
important for women because complication rates associated 
with primary prevention ICD implantation tend to be higher 
than men.23 Future research is needed to identify ways to 
reduce complication rates to maximize the net benefit from 
primary prevention ICDs in women.
Limitations
The primary limitation of this analysis is that treatment 
assignment was not assigned randomly, and despite propen-
sity matching and additional risk adjustment there remains the 
potential for residual measured and unmeasured confound-
ing by variables not captured in the GWTG-HF registry, and 
a provider’s assessment of a patient’s overall fitness for ICD 
implantation includes consideration of many of these fac-
tors together. Those patients without an ICD implanted or 
prescribed may have been too sick to undergo the procedure 
such that mortality differences may be a reflection of underly-
ing comorbidities. For example, New York Heart Association 
class was not available for this analysis or were characteris-
tics describing quality of life and patient and provider prefer-
ences, and these variables may have contributed to decisions 
surrounding ICD implantation and survival differences. This 
analysis was concerned with outcomes in patients who had 
an ICD implanted or prescribed during a HF hospitalization, 
but planned implantations cannot be confirmed. Most patients 
undergoing ICD implantation in the United States do so dur-
ing a hospital stay that is <24 hours,24 so data related to these 
implants are not available in the Medicare Part A claims to 
which we had access. We relied on a propensity score match-
ing process to develop groups for comparison that necessarily 
excludes patients who are too dissimilar to match (eg, those 
with a high burden of disease). Finally, we limited our analy-
sis to Medicare patients hospitalized at a hospital participating 
in GWTG-HF, which is a voluntary quality improvement pro-
gram. Although this group has previously been demonstrated

Conclusions
In a propensity score-matched analysis of Medicare patients 
with HF and reduced LVEF, we found both women and men 
implanted with a primary prevention ICD during or after a 
HF hospitalization had significantly longer survival than their 
counterparts who did not receive an ICD, and there were no 
significant sex-based interactions for the survival benefits 
associated with ICD placement. The associated survival ben-
efit appeared early post hospitalization but was not sensitive to 
the exclusion of patients who died within a month of discharge, 
and this benefit was present throughout available follow-up. 
These data support current guideline recommendations for the

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
Clinical trials of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) for primary prevention enrolled a limited number of women 
and were underpowered to assess benefits in this important subgroup. However, in light of the overall results of these land-
mark trials, the benefits of primary prevention ICDs have been assumed in national guidelines to apply to all eligible patients 
with heart failure regardless of sex. Ethical limitations make it unlikely that there will ever be a randomized trial of primary 
prevention ICDs in women. As such, various post hoc, retrospective, and meta-analytic evaluations of the effect of ICDs on 
mortality in women have generated varying results. Therefore, in this analysis from the Get With The Guidelines for Heart 
Failure registry, women hospitalized for heart failure who had an ICD implanted or prescribed were matched to similar 
women without an implanted or prescribed ICD using a propensity score model. When survival was compared between these 
2 groups, those women who had a primary prevention ICD implanted or prescribed had a significant survival advantage over 
women without an ICD. A parallel analysis of men from GWTG-HF demonstrated similar results. These findings support 
guideline-directed use of primary prevention ICDs in eligible patients regardless of sex.
