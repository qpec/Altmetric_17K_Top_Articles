ABSTRACT: Introduction: This study investigates the results of
a questionnaire, provocative tests, and ultrasonographic meas-
urements of carpal tunnel morphological parameters in inten-
sive and nonintensive electronic device users. Methods: Forty-
eight university students (equal numbers of intensive and nonin-
tensive users, �5 h/day and <5 h/day of electronic device
usage, respectively) were randomly selected after questionnaire
responses were received and evaluated clinically and by ultra-
sonography. All participants were right-handed. Results: Inten-
sive users had significantly more positive results in Phalen’s
and Durkan’s tests and reported more wrist/hand pain com-
pared with nonintensive users (P < 0.05). Intensive users also
had significantly larger median nerve cross-sectional areas, flat-
tening ratios, and perimeters as well as greater bowing of the
transverse carpal ligament compared with nonintensive users
(P < 0.05). Discussion: Overuse of electronic devices may
adversely affect the median nerve within the carpal tunnel and
the transverse carpal ligament, resulting in numbness, tingling,
and pain in the hand. Caution may be warranted when using
handheld electronic devices.
Muscle Nerve 000:000–000, 2017
Because of advances in information technology,
use of electronic devices has become a part of
everyday life. Frequent use of these devices without
taking regular breaks may cause repetitive strain
injury that affects not only the neck and shoulders
but also the hands and wrists.1 Smartphones and
tablet computers involve thumb or finger interac-
tions with the screen. Although these activities are
generally not physically rigorous, prolonged peri-
ods of repetitive motion could lead to excessive
force being exerted on the median nerve, thereby
compressing it.2 A recent study found that, on
average, students use electronic devices over 3 h
per day3 and report musculoskeletal complaints. In
addition, use of electronic devices compels users to
engage in extension/flexion and radial/ulnar devi-
ation of the wrist. These repetitive and awkward
hand motions are involved in the etiopathogenesis
of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS),4 possibly due to
an increase in the volume of the carpal tunnel
contents or a decrease in the size of the carpal tun-
nel,5 which results in increased pressure within the
carpal tunnel.6
Although CTS is a growing public concern for
young computer/smartphone users, relatively little
research has been carried out in this field.7–9
These
studies have
attempted to
evaluate
the
effects of smartphone overuse in relation to clini-
cal and functional status of the hand.7,8 However,
individual studies have focused on 1 type of elec-
tronic device and have not examined in detail
hand-use habits, which may lead to over/underesti-
mation of the findings. Therefore, this study inves-
tigates the results of questionnaire, physical, and
ultrasound evaluations of the hand in intensive
and
nonintensive
electronic
device
users.
We
tested the hypothesis that overuse of electronic
devices is likely to affect adversely the median
nerve within the carpal tunnel and the transverse
carpal ligament (TCL), resulting in numbness, tin-
gling, and pain in the hand. These problems must
be addressed at an early stage of CTS to prevent
permanent
nerve
damage
and
functional
sequelae.10
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants.
This study was approved by The Hong Kong
Polytechnic University Human Subjects Ethics Subcommittee.
Forty-eight university students between 18 and 25 years of
age were invited to participate in this study; all participants
provided written informed consent. Participants were selected
according to criteria used in our previous study,3 in which
students who used various electronic devices frequently (i.e.,
�5 h/day) were classified as intensive electronic device users,
whereas others who used electronic devices less frequently
(i.e., <5 h/day) were classified as nonintensive users. Five
hours was applied as a cutoff point for intensive and nonin-
tensive users because there were no previous studies to act as
a reference, so the classification was based on the Regulation
of the Code of Practice for Working with Display Screen
Equipment of the Hong Kong Occupational Safety and
Health
Branch,
Labour
Department.11
Students
were
excluded if they had (1) a history of wrist surgery or fracture;
(2) a history of CTS or other peripheral nerve disease; (3) a
history of underlying disorders associated with CTS, such as

such as bifid median nerve or persistent median artery, as
identified during the ultrasound examination; or (5) involve-
ment in regular sports activities or a part-time job that
involved repetitive wrist motions, sustained wrist deviation,
and/or prolonged pinch grip.
Self-Reported Questionnaire.
A self-reported question-
naire was administered to collect participants’ information
about the frequency and duration of electronic device use,
including computers, mobile phones, and game consoles,
and self-report of any musculoskeletal pain or discomfort in
several body regions—neck, shoulder, back, elbow, and
wrist/hand—that might relate to electronic devices usage in
the immediate 12 months prior to the survey date. The
same questionnaire had been used and validated in our pre-
vious study.3 The demographic data, such as age, sex,
height, weight, and determination of dominant hand as well
as medical history were also collected.
Physical Examinations.
Phalen’s and Durkan’s tests were
performed to confirm the participants’ current wrist status.
During Phalen’s test, the appearance of numbness or pares-
thesia in the median nerve distribution of the hand within
60 s after pushing the dorsal surfaces of both hands together
and flexing the wrists to increase pressure on the median
nerve was considered a positive result.12 In Durkan’s test, tin-
gling or abnormal sensation in the median nerve distribution
of the hand within 30 s after initiating pressure by the exam-
iner’s thumb over the median nerve at the carpal tunnel to
increase its pressure was considered a positive result.13 Posi-
tive results may be considered as indicative of CTS.14
Ultrasound Imaging.
After completion of physical exami-
nations, the ultrasound examinations were carried out with
a Philips ultrasound unit (HD11 XE; Philips Medical Sys-
tems, Bothell, WA) with an L12–5 linear array transducer of
frequency 5–12 MHZ. Participants sat on a chair facing the
examiner with the elbow flexed at approximately 908, fore-
arm resting flat on a table, hand supinated, and fingers fully
extended. During the scan, the wrist was held in a neutral
position, and the ultrasound transducer was placed trans-
versely at 5 levels of the wrist, including (1) carpal tunnel
outlet, (2) carpal tunnel inlet, (3) proximal to carpal tunnel
inlet, (4) distal radius, and (5) 4 cm proximal to distal wrist
crease (Fig. 1). These regions were chosen to delineate the
corresponding morphological changes of the median nerve
before and after passing through the carpal tunnel at differ-
ent levels. Both hands of each participant were imaged, and
wrist circumferences were measured.
The transverse images of the median nerve with meas-
urements of the cross-sectional area (CSA), flattening ratio
(FR), perimeter, circularity, and palmar bowing and thick-
ness of the TCL (Fig. 2) were obtained 3 times, and an

 average of the 3 measurements was used for analysis to
reduce random error. Definitions and measurements were
the following:
1. CSA was defined as the area within the hyperechogenic
boundary of the median nerve by a direct tracing
method15
2. FR was defined as the ratio of the medial-lateral diameter
(major axis length) to the anterior-posterior diameter
(minor axis length) of the median nerve
3. Perimeter was defined as the length of the outline of the
median nerve
4. Circularity was defined as 4p times the nerve area divided
by the square of nerve perimeter, which ranged between
0 and 1; a circularity equal to 1 indicated a perfect circle,
whereas a circularity <1 indicated deviation from a circle,
such as a more ellipsoid or irregular shape
5. Palmar bowing of the TCL was defined as the distance
from a line drawn between its attachments to the pisi-
form/hamate and the scaphoid/trapezium and taking
the measurement at 908 from this line to the palmar
apex of the ligament16
6. Thickness of the TCL was measured as closely to the mid-
line as possible in the midportion of the carpal tunnel
Statistical
Analysis.
The
images
were
processed
in
ImageJ (version 1.47; NIH, Bethesda, MD). All data were
analyzed in SPSS (version 18.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL). P <
0.05 was considered statistically significant. For the physical
examinations,
test-retest
reliability
was
analyzed
with
Cohen’s j for the dichotomous data (i.e., positive or nega-
tive findings). A j value greater than 0.75 was considered as
good agreement.17,18 For the ultrasound examinations, both
interrater and intrarater reliability were estimated by intra-
class correlation coefficient (ICC) model 3. An ICC value
greater than 0.75 was considered as good reliability.19,20 Stu-
dent’s t test was used to compare the mean of variables
between intensive and nonintensive electronic device users.
Paired t test was used to analyze the mean differences
between the dominant and nondominant hands. One-way
repeated-measures ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni adjust-
ment was used to determine the effects of morphological
changes at different levels of the wrist from the baseline
measurements. v2 Test, Spearman’s rank correlation test
(rs), and Pearson’s correlation test (r) were used to assess
univariate associations between variables and clinical find-
ings, intensity and duration on wrist/hand symptoms, and
ultrasonographic parameters, respectively.
RESULTS
Reliability of Measurements.
The j values for test-
retest reliability of Phalen’s and Durkan’s tests
were 0.650 and 0.750, respectively. For the ultra-
sound examinations, the ICC interrater and intra-
rater reliability values of the measurements of CSA
were 0.911 and 0.990, respectively; FR were 0.911
and 0.988, respectively; TCL bulge were 0.987 and
0.995, respectively; and TCL thickness were 0.911
and 0.912, respectively.
Questionnaire Survey Results.
The values obtained
from the 48 participants (24 intensive and 24 non-
intensive electronic device users) were analyzed.
There were equal numbers of men and women.
Mean age was 20 years, mean body mass index was
21.4 6 2.8 kg/m2, and all participants were right-
handed. There were no significant differences in
terms of age, sex, body mass index, height, or
weight between intensive and nonintensive users,
but there was a statistically significant difference in
the usage patterns of various electronic devices
between them. On an average day, intensive users
spent 9.1 6 2.3 h using electronic devices, whereas
nonintensive users spent 2.8 6 1.0 h using elec-
tronic devices. Intensive users spent more time
using
tablet
computers
and
playing
electronic
games than nonintensive users, whereas none of
the nonintensive users had any game devices. In
addition, they used their smartphones with a single
hand. Details are summarized in Table 1.
Intensive users reported more musculoskeletal
pain than nonintensive users, and this occurred in
1 or more sites. They also had significantly more
wrist/hand discomfort and had a higher severity
score than nonintensive users. Their discomfort
was related to electronic device usage. Details are
shown in Table 2.
Physical
Examinations
Findings.
Intensive
users
demonstrated positive Durkan’s test results more
frequently compared with nonintensive users (P <
0.01). They also had significantly larger wrist cir-
cumferences in right hand compared with nonin-
tensive users (P < 0.05).
Baseline Ultrasound Examination Findings.
Median
nerve CSAs were significantly larger in intensive
users than in nonintensive users at all levels of the
wrist except at 4 cm proximal to distal wrist crease,
whereas the FR, perimeter, and TCL bulge were
significantly larger in intensive users than in non-
intensive users at carpal tunnel inlet. In addition,
the median nerve in the dominant right hand was
significantly larger in CSA at the carpal tunnel out-
let and demonstrated a larger FR proximal to the
carpal tunnel inlet than the left hand. Similarly,
the palmar bowing of the TCL at carpal tunnel
outlet and inlet were found to be significantly
greater in the right hand than in the left hand.
Only 1 of the 24 intensive users exceeded the nor-
mal value of 10 mm2 for CSA, but all of them
exceeded the cutoff value of 3 for FR, and half
exceeded the cutoff value of 4 mm for TCL
bulge.16 Details are summarized in Table 3.

and TCL bulge (at tunnel inlet: in left hand r 5
0.351, P 5 0.014 and in right hand r 5 0.586, P <

also had a significant association with positive Dur-
kan’s test results of right hand (v2 5 14.232, P 5
0.007) as well as values of ultrasonographic param-
eters: CSA (at tunnel outlet: in left hand r 5
0.302, P 5 0.037 and in right hand r 5 0.424, P 5
0.003; at tunnel inlet: in left hand r 5 0.373, P 5

and TCL bulge (at tunnel inlet: in left hand r 5
0.356, P 5 0.013 and in right hand r 5 0.592, P <
0.001).
DISCUSSION
In this study, Phalen’s and Durkan’s test results
demonstrated moderate agreement, and the meas-
urements of size and shape of the median nerve
and TCL demonstrated good reliability. Based on
the reliability analyses, the measures used in the
study were acceptable for further analyses.
Prevalence of Wrist/Hand Pain.
The present study
found a significantly higher prevalence of wrist/
hand pain in intensive electronic device users than
in nonintensive users. This observation was consis-
tent with previous studies indicating that longer

 duration of computer use related to more preva-
lent wrist/hand discomfort.21–25 A large national
survey found that daily use of a keyboard for more
than 4 h was associated with shoulder and wrist/
hand pain.26 Additionally, there was a significant
association between time spent on gaming and
internet browsing with a mobile phone and pain
in the right thumb.27 Apart from duration, posture
is another important risk factor.28 One explanation
is that the design of input devices requiring repeti-
tive finger movements, including clicking, scroll-
ing, swiping, tapping, and pressing buttons, may
affect fingertip forces, tendon excursion, and mus-
cular effort.29 The position of input devices has
the greatest effect on the position of the shoulder,
elbow, and wrist.30 Several studies showed that
mobile device use was linked to more nonneutral
wrist postures.31–33 Such postures can increase
pressure in the carpal tunnel which may relate to
CTS.34
We also observed that, compared with nonin-
tensive users, intensive users had more positive test
results. This finding was comparable to a previous
study by Aydeniz and G€
ursoy35 showing that, com-
pared with nonusers, extensive computer users had
more positive clinical test results for musculoskele-
tal diagnoses in the elbow and wrist regions. They
found that all disorders were more common in the
right hand than in the left hand, which is in agree-
ment with the current study. This suggests that
intensive users may be more prone to pain in their
wrists and more susceptible to CTS.
Baseline
Values
of
Ultrasonographic
Parameters
Among Intensive Electronic Device Users.
The most
important result of the current study is that inten-
sive users had significantly enlarged and flattened
median nerves and greater TCL bulge within the
carpal tunnel compared with nonintensive users.
This may be due to frequent use of hands and fin-
gers to operate the devices. This observation is
consistent with previous studies indicating that
excessive use of smartphones may adversely affect
the median nerve and increase the probability of
occurrence of CTS.7–9 Other studies found evi-
dence for wrist abnormalities in computer users,
such as restricted wrist range of motion36 and
reduced sensory nerve function.37 This suggests
that intensive users may have a higher risk of
developing
CTS,
and,
thus,
precautions
are
required when using electronic devices.
Baseline Values of Ultrasonographic Parameters in the
Dominant Hand.
We found significant differences
between both hands in CSA and FR of the median
nerve as well as in the palmar bowing and thick-
ness
of
the
TCL.
These
differences
may
be
explained by greater activity of the dominant
hand. Because the participants in this study were
right-handed, their mean baseline values of the
right hand were higher. This observation was con-
sistent with previous studies showing that the CSA
and the FR are significantly higher in the domi-
nant hand.38,39 Meanwhile, larger wrist circumfer-
ence of the dominant hand in intensive users was
found in this study. This may be due to the habit
preference
of
single-hand
use.
Recent
studies
showed that smartphone operation with 1 hand
caused greater upper trapezius pain and induced
increased upper extremity muscle activity than
operation with both hands.40,41 A study by _
Inal
and colleagues7 also showed enlargement of the
median nerve in highly active smartphone users
who have a habit of single-handheld smartphone
use. They further demonstrated that not only the
median nerve but also tendons were significantly
larger in the dominant hand of smartphone users
than in the dominant hand of nonusers. Although
ergonomic standards and guidelines for computer
workstations are readily available today, they usu-
ally are not compatible with the current setups

In this study we found no correlation

and demographic factors. However, the amount of
time spent on electronic devices was strongly asso-

CTS Risk From Device Overuse
MUSCLE & NERVE
Month 2017
 pain intensity and inconvenience to everyday life
were common among computer users.
Similarly, the total number of electronic devices
used was strongly associated with a positive Dur-
kan’s sign in the right hand. This observation was
consistent with a previous study showing a positive
correlation between cumulative hours of computer
use and positive Tinel’s and Phalen’s signs in the
right hand.35 Another study focusing on smart-
phone use also reported that positive Phalen’s and
reverse Phalen’s test signs were associated with the
degree of addiction to smartphones, periods of
use, duration of use per day, and duration of con-
tinuous usage time.8 These clinical tests have been
used to aid in the diagnosis of CTS, but it should
be noted that the reported sensitivity and specific-
ity of Tinel’s and Phalen’s tests vary from 30% to
100%.45
Furthermore, the amount of time spent on
electronic devices and total number of electronic
devices used were positively associated with CSA
and FR of the median nerve as well as palmar bow-
ing of the TCL. This observation was consistent
with previous studies showing that frequency, dura-
tion, and years of experience using electronic devi-
ces may cause the enlargement of the median
nerve and other soft tissues, such as tendons,
within the carpal tunnel.7,46 These studies also con-
cluded that intensity of electronic device use was
positively correlated with pain duration and sever-
ity. Another study found that a reduction in the
size of the space within the carpal tunnel was due
to thickened muscles and ligaments after the use
of
smartphones,
and,
thus,
these
soft
tissues
pressed on the median nerve.9 This also explains
why the median nerve exhibits acute changes in
response to a keyboarding task.38,47 In these 2
cited studies, the authors further suggested that
CSA increased after 30–60 min of keyboarding,
returning to baseline after 30 min of rest; they also
observed greater changes of the median nerve in
those who typed with greater angles of ulnar devia-
tion.48 This suggests that exercise and rest breaks
should be used for reducing the risk of CTS associ-
ated with computer-related tasks.
Limitations of the Study.
This study has several lim-
itations. The small sample and relatively homoge-
neous study population limit generalizability. The
cross-sectional design may lead to false-positive or
false-negative outcomes. The self-reported nature
of the data may raise questions regarding accuracy.
The diagnosis of CTS relied on clinical symptoms
(Phalen’s and Durkan’s tests) rather than electro-
diagnostic testing (nerve conduction studies and
electromyography).
Therefore,
additional
exploration may be required for verification of
these results.
In conclusion, intensive electronic device users
had an enlarged and flattened median nerve and
greater TCL bulge within the carpal tunnel; also,
they more frequently (1) had positive clinical tests
indicative of CTS and (2) reported wrist/hand
pain compared with nonintensive users. Caution
may be warranted when using handheld electronic
devices to minimize the chance of developing CTS.
