 leeches
 present
 a very

 Introduction
Foreign
 bodies
 in
 the
 upper
 airways
 are
 one
 of
 the
 most
 chal-
lenging
 otolaryngology
 emergencies,
 leeches
 are
 a
 very
 rare
 cause
of
 airways
 foreign
 bodies
 around
 the
 world.
 Leeches
 are
 segmented
worms
 that
 are
 generally
 found
 in
 streams,
 pools
 and
 springs.
 They
can
 enter
 the
 human
 body
 when
 people
 swim
 in
 contaminative
streams
 or
 drink
 infested
 water.
 We  report
 an
 unusual
 case
 of
 a
6
 −year-old
 girl
 with
 a
 severe
 dyspnea
 caused
 by
 laryngeal
 leech
infestation.
2.
 Case
A
 6-year-old
 girl
 was
 referred
 to
 our
 otolaryngology
 depart-
ment
 at
 a
 tertiary
 university
 hospital
 with
 a
 severe
 dyspnea
 and
hemoptysis.
 Her
 parents
 reported
 that
 2
 month
 after
 drinking
 from
stream
 water,
 the
 patient
 developed
 hemoptysis
 and
 dysphonia
without
 odynophagia
 or
 dysphagia.
 Nasofibroscopy
 revealed
 a
 dark
living
 leech
 in
 the
 supraglottic
 area
 which
 extends
 to
 the
 glot-
tis
 (Fig.
 1).
 The
 patient
 was
 urgently
 admitted
 to
 the

room.
 An
 orotracheal
 tube
 and
 material
 for
 tracheotomy
 were
 cau-
tiously
 prepared.
 Under
 general
 anesthesia,
 a
 rigid
 laryngoscope
was
 placed,
 taking
 care
 not
 to
 touch
 the
 leech,
 pushing
 the
 epiglottis
forward
 and
 exposing
 the
 entire
 laryngeal
 cavity.
 The
 laryngoscope
was
 suspended
 and
 the
 vestibule
 was
 carefully
 examined.
 A
 living
leech
 was
 located
 on
 the
 anterior
 supraglottic
 area
 with
 its
 sucking
head
 stuck
 into
 the
 anterior
 commissure
 just
 below
 the
 vocal
 cords.
The
 leech
 was
 grasped
 and
 removed
 with
 a
 foreign
 body
 forceps
with
 a
 full
 length
 estimated
 to
 be
 more
 than
 6
 cm
 (Fig.
 2).
 All
 symp-
toms
 were
 relieved
 post
 operatively
 and
 she
 was
 discharged
 a
 day
later.

 Discussion
Leeches
 are
 parasites
 that
 live
 on
 occasional
 blood
 sucking
 by
attaching
 to
 fish,
 amphibians,
 and
 mammals
 [1].
 They
 use
 anterior
suckers
 consisting
 of
 the
 jaw
 and
 teeth
 to
 attach
 to
 their
 host’s
mucous
 membrane
 to
 feed.
 Leeches
 can
 secrete
 an
 anticoagulant
enzyme
 named
 hirudin,
 which
 inhibits
 coagulation
 of
 the
 blood
[2,3].
 Therefore,
 signs
 of
 bleeding
 can
 be
 seen,
 such
 as
 epistaxis,
hematemesis,
 hemoptysis,
 or
 even
 anemia,
 depending
 on
 the
 exact
site
 of
 the
 infestation
 [3].
Leeches
 can
 ingest
 blood
 up
 to
 approximately
 9
 times
 their
 own
body
 weight
 [4].
 Signs
 of
 airways
 obstruction
 such
 as
 nasal
 obstruc-
tion,
 dyspnea
 or
 suffocation
 can
 therefore
 progress
 over
 time
 [4].

 extraction.
Besides,
 a
 foreign
 body
 sensation,
 dysphagia
 or
 hoarseness
 may
 also
be
 found
 [3,4].
There
 are
 only
 a
 few
 reports
 of
 living
 leeches
 stuck
 in
 the
 larynx
[5].
 Leeches
 can
 attach
 to
 the
 mucosa
 of
 the
 entire
 upper
 aerodi-
gestive
 tract
 but
 a
 leech
 stuck
 in
 the
 larynx
 is
 rarely
 seen
 [6].
The
 presence
 of
 a
 living
 leech
 in
 the
 respiratory
 tract
 should
be
 suspected
 in
 patients
 who
 complain
 of
 hemoptysis,
 hoarseness,
and
 respiratory
 distress
 of
 unknown
 origin
 with
 a
 recent
 history
of
 contact
 with
 untreated
 water.
 The
 symptoms
 may
 be
 misdiag-
nosed
 as
 laryngitis,
 asthma,
 infections
 such
 as
 tuberculosis
 or
 even
malignancies
 [7].
Direct
 laryngoscopy
 under
 general
 anesthesia
 is
 the
 best
approach
 for
 removal
 of
 a
 leech
 from
 the
 aerodigestive
 tract.
As
 a
 leech
 attaches
 strongly
 with
 its
 sucking
 head,
 removal
should
 be
 done
 carefully
 [7].
 How
 the
 leech
 is
 grasped
 is
also
 important
 because
 it
 is
 slippery
 and
 could
 rupture
 eas-
ily,
 thus,
 using
 forceps
 with
 blunt
 jaws
 is
 recommended.
 Great
care
 should
 also
 be
 taken
 to
 entirely
 remove
 all
 parts
 of
 the
body.
 Rupture
 of
 the
 leech
 with
 parts
 of
 the
 head
 remaining
could
 result
 in
 continued
 bleeding
 because
 the
 suckers
 contain
hirudin,
 which
 is
 an
 anticoagulant
 enzyme.
 Some
 experts
 advise
using
 lidocaine
 in
 tough
 cases
 as
 it
 causes
 relaxation
 of
 the
 head
suckers.
4.
 Conclusion
Leeches
 should
 be
 suspected
 as
 an
 airway
 foreign
 body
 in
patients
 with
 a
 recent
 history
 of
 drinking
 stream
 water,
 it
 should
be
 diagnosed
 and
 treated
 promptly
 to
 avoid
 disastrous
 out-
comes.
 Nasofibroscopy
 makes
 a
 definite
 diagnosis
 to
 detect
 a
leech
 in
 the
 larynx.
 Direct
 laryngoscopy
 is
 the
 procedure
 of
choice
 to
 extract
 it.
 Prevention
 remains
 the
 best
 treatment
 for
such
 cases
 based
 simply
 on
 hygiene
 measures
 like
 not
 drinking
stream
 water
 directly
 and
 filtering
 drinking
 water
 before
 it
 is
used.
