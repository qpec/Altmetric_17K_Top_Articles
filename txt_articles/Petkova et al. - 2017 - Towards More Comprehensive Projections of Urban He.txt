Introduction
High temperatures have long been recognized 
to have substantial impacts on mortality, and 
with growing concerns about climate change, 
numerous studies have projected future heat-
related mortality due to climate change in 
recent years (Baccini et al. 2011; Dessai 2003; 
Gosling et al. 2009; Hayhoe et al. 2004, 2010; 
Jackson et al. 2010; Knowlton et al. 2007; 
Ostro et al. 2012; Peng et al. 2011; Sheridan 
et al. 2012). Some studies have characterized 
the relationships between temperature and 
mortality over the full temperature spectrum 
at a given location in order to estimate the 
current and future “net impact” of tempera-
ture on mortality (Doyon et al. 2008; Guest 
et al. 1999; Li T et al. 2013; Martens 1998; 
Martin et al. 2012). We chose to focus here 
on heat-related mortality because adapta-
tion responses to cold would likely be quite 
different, and to date, adaptation responses 
to cold have not been as thoroughly studied 
as those to heat. In addition, previous work 
in New York City (New York) suggested that 
increases in heat-related mortality are likely 
to be substantial and may not be offset by 
decreases in cold-related mortality (Li T 
et al. 2013).
Projections of temperature-related 
mortality are, unfortunately, often limited 
by insufficient understanding of the popula-
tion adaptation to heat. To date, relatively 
few heat-health impact studies have consid-
ered future adaptation. Some studies have 
used temperature–mortality curves from 
“analogue cities” that currently experience 
temperatures similar to those projected to 
occur in the future at a location of interest 
(Kalkstein and Green 1997; Knowlton et al. 
2007) or temperature–mortality curves from 
hotter “analogue summers” that have previ-
ously occurred in the same location (Hayhoe 
et al. 2004). Other studies have developed 
scenarios for acclimatization to specific 
increases in temperatures over time (Dessai 
2003; Gosling et al. 2009; Kalkstein and 
Green 1997). However, to our knowledge, 
no previous studies have quantified future 
adaptation trends based on historical patterns 
of adaptation in the city under study.
An important question to consider is 
whether the future population response to 
high temperatures should be projected based 
on observations from the present and/or the 
recent past. Cities are complex adaptive systems 
(Holland 1995; Lansing 2003) capable of self-
organizing in order to adapt to environmental 
conditions. At the same time, there are limits to 
social adaptation (Dow et al. 2013) that are yet 
to be well understood and quantified.
In addition to future changes in climate 
and population adaptation to heat, future 
demographics are important determinants of 
health impacts (Huang et al. 2011). Utilizing 
multiple population change scenarios is also 
important for quantifying the range and 
uncertainty of potential temperature-related 
health impacts.
We start by developing heat adaptation 
models that project the population response 
to heat until the year 2100 based on eight 
decades of historical daily temperature and 
mortality data. The approach is particularly 
suitable for New York City, which is among

Background: High temperatures have substantial impacts on mortality and, with growing 
concerns about climate change, numerous studies have developed projections of future heat-
related deaths around the world. Projections of temperature-related mortality are often limited by 
insufficient information to formulate hypotheses about population sensitivity to high temperatures 
and future demographics.
oBjectives: The present study derived projections of temperature-related mortality in New York 
City by taking into account future patterns of adaptation or demographic change, both of which 
can have profound influences on future health burdens.
Methods: We adopted a novel approach to modeling heat adaptation by incorporating an analysis 
of the observed population response to heat in New York City over the course of eight decades. This 
approach projected heat-related mortality until the end of the 21st century based on observed trends 
in adaptation over a substantial portion of the 20th century. In addition, we incorporated a range 
of new scenarios for population change until the end of the 21st century. We then estimated future 
heat-related deaths in New York City by combining the changing temperature–mortality relation-
ship and population scenarios with downscaled temperature projections from the 33 global climate 
models (GCMs) and two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs).
results: The median number of projected annual heat-related deaths across the 33 GCMs varied 
greatly by RCP and adaptation and population change scenario, ranging from 167 to 3,331 in the 
2080s compared with 638 heat-related deaths annually between 2000 and 2006.
conclusions: These findings provide a more complete picture of the range of potential future 
heat-related mortality risks across the 21st century in New York City, and they highlight the 
 
importance of both demographic change and adaptation responses in modifying future risks.

the largest cities in the world and has retained 
a relatively consistent urban shape over the 
entire historical period covered by this study. 
We then develop demographic scenarios that 
characterize potential changes in the city 
population during the study period. Finally, 
we calculate future heat-related deaths by 
combining the derived temperature–mortality 
relationships and population scenarios with 
the downscaled temperature projections from 
the 33 global climate models (GCMs) and the 
two Representative Concentration Pathways 
(RCPs), RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, developed in 
support of the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC)’s Fifth Assessment 
Report (AR5) (IPCC 2013).
Methods
Daily Mortality Data
The process of the historical daily mortality 
data preparation and validation has been 
discussed in detail previously (Petkova et al. 
2014). Death records prior to 1949 are stored 
at the New York City Department of Records 
and Information Services (DORIS 2016). 
Death indexes for all years between 1900 and 
1949, including each documented death in 
the five New York City boroughs (Bronx, 
Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten 
Island) from 1900 to 1948, were scanned 
by the Genealogy Federation of Long Island 
(http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.
com/~gfli/). Annual numbers of deaths calcu-
lated from these records were compared with 
the numbers published in the New York City 
Department of Health’s annual Summary 
of Vital Statistics reports. Annual calculated 
numbers of deaths were between 0.02% and 
4.94% (median 0.95%) higher than those 
reported in the annual Summary of Vital 
Statistics reports (Petkova et al. 2014).
Death records for the years after 1950 are 
stored at the New York City Department of 
Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOH 
MH 2016) and were not directly accessible or 
available in digital format for this study.
Daily multiple-cause-of-death mortality 
data for all five New York City boroughs for 
1973–2006 were obtained in collaboration 
with Joel Schwartz and colleagues at Harvard 
University School of Public Health from the 
U.S. National Center for Health Statistics 
(NCHS 2016).
Temperature Data
Daily temperature data before 1949 were 
obtained for New York Central Park from 
the United States Historical Climatology 
Network (USHCN) [National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) 
National Centers for Environmental 
Information 2016]. There were five missing 
records in the data prior to 1949 that were 
substituted with the averages of the previous 
and following day temperatures. Daily 
temperature data, also from the New York 
Central Park station from 1973 onwards, were 
obtained from the National Climatic Data 
Center (NCDC 2016).
Historical Heat–Mortality 
Relationships
We used the distributed lag nonlinear model 
(DLNM) module in R (Gasparrini 2011) to 
characterize the temperature–mortality rela-
tionships for each time period. Distributed lag 
nonlinear models allow simultaneous charac-
terization of the nonlinear and lagged effects 
of temperature on mortality (Armstrong 2006; 
Gasparrini et al. 2010). Decadal models for 
1900–1909 (1900s), 1910–1919 (1910s), 
1920–1929 (1920s), 1930–1939 (1930s), 
1940–1948 (1940s), 1973–1979 (1970s), 
1980–1989 (1980s), 1990–1999 (1990s), 
and 2000–2006 (2000s) were developed 
using the mean daily temperature, and 22°C 
(corresponding to approximately the 80th 
percentile of annual temperature) was used as 
a reference temperature for calculating relative 
risk. The temperature-mortality analysis was 
restricted to the summer months (June to 
September) in order to focus on heat-related 
mortality. The model is represented by the 
following equation:
log[E(yt)] = α + f (xt; β) + s(t; γ) + g(jt; η) 
 
+ Σ6
p = 1δpIp(dt) 
[1]
where
• E(yt) is the expected number of deaths at day t
• f is the function modeling the association 
with x, a moving average of temperature over 
a lag of 3 days (lag 0–3), with parameters β
• s is the function of time t modeling the 
long-term trend with parameters γ
• g is the function of the day of the year j 
modeling the seasonal trend with parameters η
• Ip is a series of indicators modeling the 
association with day of the week d with 
parameters δp.
Although longer lags have been found to 
be appropriate in modeling heat-mortality 
impacts in the beginning of the 20th century 
because of some immediate partial harvesting 
following exposure to heat, shorter lags have 
been found to adequately capture heat effects 
in recent decades (Petkova et al. 2014). Thus, 
a lag of 3 days was selected to focus on the 
immediate impact of heat on mortality. 
We defined f as a cross-basis composed of a 
quadratic spline with 4 degrees of freedom 
with 2 knots at equally spaced percentiles of 
temperature distribution for the exposure–
response function, and a natural spline with 2 
degrees of freedom with 2 knots for the lag–
response function. The functions s and g were 
defined as natural cubic splines with 7 degrees 
of freedom per decade and with 4 degrees of 
freedom for day in year, respectively.
Temperature Projections
The methods used here have been described 
by Petkova et al. (2013). Downscaled climate 
projections were developed using monthly 
Bias Corrected Spatially Disaggregated 
(BCSD) data at 1/8° resolution (Maurer et al. 
2007). The data are derived from the WCRP 
CMIP5 multi-model data set and include 33 
GCMs used in the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment 
Report. The global climate models along with 
their originating institution and atmospheric 
resolution are presented in Table 1.
Projections are provided for two RCPs 
(Moss et al. 2010). The pathways are the basis 
for short- and long-term climate modeling 
experiments and make various underlying 
assumptions about radiative forcing through 
time, which depends upon future global 
greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations, 
and land use changes.
The two RCPs used in this analysis were 
RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, which are the most 
frequently used RCPs among the climate 
modeling community. These two scenarios 
represent relatively low (4.5) and high (8.5) 
greenhouse gas projections/radiative forcing 
through the end of the century. Under 
RCP4.5, stabilization of greenhouse gas 
concentrations occurs shortly after 2100 as 
a product of emissions reduction before that 
time. RCP8.5 is a scenario with increasing 
emissions through the century, associated with 
an energy-intensive future and limited use of 
green technologies (van Vuuren et al. 2011).
To develop daily temperature projections, 
the monthly output from the climate models 
for the 1/8° grid box corresponding to New 
York City (Central Park) was used to develop 
change factors for each calendar month based 
on the difference between a 30-year future 
average for that calendar month and the same 
model’s 30-year baseline average for that same 
calendar month (Horton et al. 2011). The 
monthly change factors were then applied 
to the corresponding observed daily weather 
data to create a future projection.
The combination of 33 models and 2 RCPs 
yielded 66 synthetic future temperature projec-
tions for daily mean temperature from 2010 to 
2099 that are based on three 30-year time slices, 
defined as the 2020s (2010–2039), the 2050s 
(2040–2069) and the 2080s (2070–2099).
Population Projections
A comprehensive set of population projections 
for New York State until 2040 and a detailed 
methodology were previously derived by the 
Cornell Center for Applied Demographics 
(Vink 2009).
Projections were developed for this 
study by establishing a range of assumptions

ning of the projection according to the 
Decennial Census 2010. See 2010 Census

the year before point t in time and point t 
of people who would otherwise have been 
age a at point t. It is a function of age-
specific mortality rates and the number of 
people at risk
• NMa
t – 1,t is the net migration between the 
year before point t in time and point t of 
people who are age a at point t. Net migra-
tion is the difference between the number 
of people moving in (a function of an age 
profile and the total level of people moving 
in) and the number of people moving out 
(a function of age-specific rates and the local 
population of a certain age).
This set of equations was set up  
separately 
by sex.
We defined five different scenarios for 
projecting future New York City popula-
tions by altering the parameters of the 
above-mentioned equations. The “baseline” 
scenario assumed that all parameters of the 
model remained constant; that is, age-specific 
fertility and mortality rates and age character-
istics of migration were all held constant, but 
the population aged forward. The “decreased 
mortality” scenario assumed a decrease in age-
specific mortality rates such that the values 
reached 2/3 of the 2010 values in 2100. Life 
expectancy at birth would increase by 6 years 
over time under this scenario, which is in line 
with the mortality assumptions in the recent 
Census Bureau projections (U.S. Census 
Bureau 2012). The third scenario, “increased 
in-migration,” assumed that the growth of 
domestic in-migration (from other parts of the 
United States to New York City) would be half 
of the growth of the U.S. population and that 
the growth of international in-migration (from 
outside of the United States to New York City) 
would be half of the growth of the projected 
international in-migration nationwide [from

versions of their GCM.

the Census 2010 projections (U.S. Census 
Bureau 2010)]. The fourth scenario, “increased 
out-migration,” assumed that the rate of out-
migration would increase by 25% over the 
projection period. The assumptions for the 
increased in-migration and increased out-
migration are rather arbitrary, but they aim 
to strike a balance between reasonable and 
informative. More radical assumptions would 
lead to New York City populations that would 
introduce various complications because of 
overcrowding or high vacancy rates. Finally, we 
also used a “constant” no-population change 
scenario in which the population and the age 
of the population remained constant at the 
2010 levels.
Projected Heat-Related Mortality
As previously reported (Petkova et al. 2014), 
relative risks (RRs) estimated for heat-related 
mortality were relatively constant during 
the first part of 20th century, suggesting 
little adaptation to heat during this period, 
whereas RRs decreased from the 1970s to the 
2000s, consistent with substantial adapta-
tion to heat. Specifically, the average relative 
risk of mortality associated with a daily mean 
temperature of 29°C versus 22°C during 
June–September ranged from 1.30 [95% 
confidence interval (CI): 1.25, 1.36] in the 
1910s to 1.43 (95% CI: 1.37, 1.49) in the 
1900s. In contrast, predicted average RRs 
for the same exposure contrast fell from 1.38 
(95% CI: 1.31, 1.44) during 1900–1948 to 
only 1.15 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.20) during 1973–
2006 (p-value < 0.001), suggesting rapid 
adaptation since the 1970s (Petkova et al. 
2014). We believe that increased access to air 
conditioning in recent years was the primary 
cause of the apparent increase in adaptation. 
A random-effects meta-regression including 
a linear term for decade predicted a decrease 
of 4.6% (95% CI: 2.4%, 6.7%) per decade 
(p-value < 0.001) (Petkova et al. 2014).
Because we did not have mortality data 
from the 1950s and 1960s, we could not 
verify the precise onset of the adaptation 
process (as indicated by the downward shift 
in the trend for RRs). However, if we assume 
that access to air conditioning was the major 
driving force behind heat adaptation, it is 
plausible to define three stages in the popula-
tion response to heat: before the introduc-
tion of domestic air conditioning, during 
air conditioning penetration, and after air 
conditioning penetration levels reach a steady 
state. Because 84% of surveyed households in 
New York City in 2003 already had air condi-
tioning in their homes (U.S. Census Bureau 
2004), compared with only 39% in 1970 
(U.S. Census Bureau 1978), we assume that 
the prevalence of air conditioning will reach a 
steady state level sometime in the near future.
Future heat-related mortality relative risks 
at each degree Celsius (°C) were derived for 
temperatures ≥ 25°C using the temperature-
specific relative risk estimates from the 
historical decades as described above. Decade-
specific temperature curves were linearly 
extrapolated for temperatures ≤ 41°C, the 
highest projected temperature, using the last 
four temperature data points of each curve.

The initial level of temperature-specific 
relative risk (RRMAX) at each temperature was 
determined by selecting the mean relative risk 
from the first part of the 20th century, corre-
sponding to the preadaptation part of the 
sigmoid curve. The RRRANGE was derived as 
the difference between the RRMAX and RRMIN, 
where RRMIN is the minimum relative risk 
for a given temperature or the value to which 
the sigmoidal curve converges. We developed 
two future adaptation scenarios in addition 
to a no-adaptation scenario: a scenario of 
high adaptation where the projected RRMIN 
in 2100 is 80% lower than the RR observed 
at the same temperature during the 2000s, 
and a scenario of moderate adaptation where 
the projected RRMIN in 2100 is 20% lower 
than the corresponding observed RR during 
the 2000s. Y represents the year for which 
RRADAPT is calculated, and Y0 represents the 
half decay point, or the year in which RRMAX 
drops by half of the RRRANGE. The steep-
ness of the transition between the periods 
of no adaptation and complete adaptation is 
determined by the coefficient α. Both α and 
Y0 were subjected to nonlinear least squares 
optimization using the data points for the last 
four decades. We are not proposing a scenario

(2000–2006). RRs were calculated for June–September using a model with a quadratic spline with 4 degrees of freedom and 22°C as a reference temperature.

assuming 100% adaptation because sub-
populations of vulnerable individuals without 
access to air conditioning or other means of 
heat relief are likely to continue to exist in the 
future; thus, heat-related mortality may not 
be completely avoidable.
Future heat-related deaths were calculated 
as described by Petkova et al. (2013). In the 
present study, population change and heat 
adaptation scenarios were also incorporated 
into the calculations. The temperature-specific 
relative risks derived from the no adapta-
tion, high-adaptation and low-adaptation 
scenarios were applied to the daily, downscaled 
 
temperature projections until 2100.
Results
Our previous study of heat adaptation 
patterns in New York City that examined 
daily temperature and mortality data spanning 
more than a century found no evidence of 
adaptation during the beginning of the 20th 
century, but evidence of rapid adaptation in 
subsequent decades was observed (Petkova 
et al. 2014). Based on these findings, we 
developed a three-stage model of adapta-
tion. We also developed two future adapta-
tion scenarios, of low and high adaptation, 
assuming different levels of adaptation 
throughout the 21st century. Temperature-
specific mortality curves for New York City 
calculated according to the low- and high-
adaptation scenarios are illustrated in Figure 1. 
Points represent the relative risks calculated 
using the DLNM model for each temperature 
for the 1970s through the 2000s.
To characterize possible population change 
pathways in New York City throughout the 
21st century, we developed four new popula-
tion scenarios, making a range of assumptions 
about future mortality, in-migration, and out-
migration. Population projections (Figure 2) 
based on the four scenarios developed for this 
study were used in addition to a no- 
population-
change (constant) scenario to derive assessments 
of future heat-related mortality. Annual popu-
lation projections according to each scenario 
along with the corresponding mortality rates are 
provided in Table S1.
Finally, we obtained statistically down-
scaled future mean temperature projections 
for New York City from 33 GCMs used in 
the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report and two 
RCPs, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, representing 
relatively low and high greenhouse gas projec-
tions, respectively. Combining these yielded an 
ensemble of 66 model/scenario combinations 
for future health impact calculations.
Future mortality estimates varied greatly 
depending on the choice of demographic 
and adaptation scenario. To emphasize the 
influence of both population change and heat 
adaptation, we used the 33 climate model 
median and the two RCPs. Median numbers 
of projected heat-related deaths across the 33 
GCMs used during the 2020s, 2050s and 
2080s are summarized by RCP, adaptation 
scenario and population scenario in Figure 3 
and Table 2.
The estimated median number of heat-
related deaths across the 33 GCMs is substan-
tially higher under RCP8.5 as the century 
progresses, and in many cases, the number of 
deaths projected under RCP8.5 is more than 
twice the corresponding estimate for RCP4.5 
under the same time, population, and adap-
tation scenarios. These findings suggest that 
the number of deaths would be substantially 
reduced under the lower-emission pathway, 
RCP4.5. For example, we estimate that by the 
2080s, 1,494 annual heat-related deaths could 
be avoided under the increased in-migration/
low adaptation scenario, based on projections 
of 2,771 versus 1,277 deaths under RCP8.5 
and RCP4.5, respectively (Table 2).
Projected heat-related mortality was 
highest for the increased in-migration popu-
lation scenario, followed by the baseline, 
increased out-migration, decreased mortality, 
and constant population scenarios. As an 
example, for the 2080s under the RCP8.5/
high adaptation scenario, we projected 804 
deaths under the increased in-migration 
scenario, 698 deaths under the baseline 
scenario, 624 deaths under both the increased 
out-migration and decreased mortality 
scenarios, and 379 deaths under the constant 
population scenario.
Increasing levels of adaptation reduced 
the number of projected deaths substantially. 
For example, by the 2080s, 3,331, 2,271, and 
804 deaths were projected to occur under 
RCP8.5 and the increased in-migration/
no adaptation, increased in-migration/low 
adaptation, and increased in-migration/high 
adaptation, respectively. As another example, 
during the 2020s and under RCP4.5, the 
median number of heat-related deaths across 
the 33 GCMs was 370 for the constant popu-
lation scenario with no adaptation and 149 for 
the same scenario with high adaptation.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this study is the first to 
present projections of heat-related mortality 
until the end of the 21st century while incor-
porating assumptions of heat adaptation 
based on historical mortality data spanning 
over a century. Our adaptation model char-
acterized long-term trends in the popula-
tion response to heat and under alternative 
assumptions about the limits to future adap-
tation. There is considerable agreement that 
limits to adaptation to climate change exist

developed for this study. “Baseline” assumed that all parameters of the model remain constant; that is, 
age-specific fertility and mortality rates and age characteristics of migration are all kept constant, but the 
population ages forward. “Decreased mortality” assumed a decrease in age-specific mortality rates such 
that the values reach 2/3 of the 2010 values by 2100. “Increased in-migration” assumed that the growth of 
domestic in-migration (from other parts of the United States to New York City) will be half of the growth of 
the U.S. population and that the growth of international in-migration (from outside of the United States to 
New York City) will be half of the growth of the projected international in-migration nationwide. “Increased 
out-migration”: assumed that the rate of out-migration would increase by 25% over the projection period. 
“Constant” assumed that the population and the age of the population remain constant at 2010 levels.

and are often defined by interactions between 
climate change and biophysical and socio-
economic constraints, among other factors 
(Klein et al. 2014). Quantifying the potential 
limits and obstacles to climate change adapta-
tion as they relate to various health outcomes 
is critical for achieving optimal resource 
 
allocation and long-term planning.
Projecting future population adaptation 
to heat is among the most important chal-
lenges in assessing the burden of heat-related 
mortality under a changing climate. Here, we

data are provided in Table 2. Heat adaptation 
scenarios are indicated by circle size and 
include “high adaptation,” where adaptation, 
as measured by the minimal relative risk for a 
given temperature to be reached by the year 
2100 (RRmin), is projected to reach a value 80% 
lower than the RR calculated at each degree 
Celsius (°C) during the 2000s; “low adapta-
tion,” where adaptation, as measured by RRmin, 
is projected to reach a value 20% lower than 
the RR calculated at each degree Celsius (°C) 
during the 2000s; and “no adaptation,” wherein 
future adaptation does not occur and adapta-
tion, as measured by RRmin, remains the same 
as the RR calculated at each degree Celsius 
(°C) during the 2000s. Population scenarios are 
indicated by color and included “baseline,” 
which assumed that all parameters of the 
model remain constant; that is, age-specific 
fertility and mortality rates and age char-
acteristics of migration are all kept constant, 
but the population ages forward; “decreased 
mortality,” which assumed a decrease in age-
specific mortality rates such that the values 
reach 2/3 of the 2010 values by 2100; “increased 
in-migration,” which assumed that the growth 
of domestic in-migration (from other parts of 
the United States to New York City) will be half 
of the growth of the U.S. population and that 
the growth of international in-migration (from 
outside of the United States to New York City) 
will be half of the growth of the projected inter-
national in-migration nationwide; “increased 
out-migration,”which assumed that the rate 
of out-migration would increase by 25% over 
the projection period; and “constant,” which 
assumed that the population and the age of the 
population remain constant at 2010 levels. For 
reference, there were 638 heat-related deaths 
annually between 2000 and 2006.

have proposed a novel approach to modeling 
heat adaptation that allows the consideration of 
observed trends in adaptation since the begin-
ning of the 20th century. Because our previous 
findings suggested that there was no adapta-
tion to heat in New York City during the first 
part of the 20th century (Petkova et al. 2014), 
we used the mean relative risk estimated for 
the early part of the 20th century to anchor 
the upper segment of the sigmoidal adaptation 
function (Equation 3) for that period. We used 
the declining relative risks estimated for recent 
decades to characterize adaptation that occurred 
as the prevalence of air conditioning increased, 
and we extrapolated this decline through 2100 
under two different adaptation scenarios repre-
senting both modest and substantial increases 
in adaptation from the 2010 level.
Although population change is considered 
to be among the most important factors in 
estimating future temperature impacts, future 
demographics are often not taken into account 
because location-specific population projec-
tions are generally not readily available beyond 
several decades. To address this issue, we 
developed new population change scenarios 
to apply to our projections of heat-related 
mortality. Finally, we combined the developed 
population and heat adaptation scenarios with 
temperature projections from multiple GCMs 
and two RCPs to derive a comprehensive 
assessment of heat-related mortality until the 
end of the 21st century.
Annual future mortality estimates varied 
greatly by RCP, as well as by population 
change and adaptation scenario. For instance, 
the constant population/high adaptation 
scenario produced the lowest death estimates, 
projecting 167 and 379 heat-related deaths 
during the 2080s under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, 
respectively. The increased in-migration/no 
adaptation scenario produced the highest 
mortality estimates under RCP8.5, projecting 
555 and 3,331 deaths during the 2020s and 
the 2080s, respectively.
Both the heat adaptation and demo-
graphic scenarios have several limitations. 
First, our model of heat-related mortality over 
time was based on an empirical fit to historical 
data and extrapolation using a sigmoidal curve 
into the future. We did not identify and incor-
porate causal factors such as air conditioning 
use into the projection of future heat response. 
Future research that focuses on characterizing 
the impact of heat over time among vulner-
able populations would be particularly useful 
in improving the utility of the adaptation 
models. In addition, studies quantifying the 
impact of various public health interventions 
such as heat warning systems, cooling centers, 
and other preventive measures on heat-related 
mortality would be valuable for the further 
development of this work. Another important 
limitation of the study is that decade-specific 
mortality versus temperature curves were 
linearly extrapolated to high temperatures 
projected to occur under changing climate 
(e.g., temperatures of 41°C) for which no 
historical mortality data exist. This extrapo-
lation may underestimate mortality impacts 
at such very high temperatures, particularly 
during the initial exposures of the populations 
to temperatures that they have not previously 
experienced. Studies of mortality responses in 
unacclimatized populations would be particu-
larly useful in characterizing heat impacts at 
very high temperatures. Finally, we acknowl-
edge that the assumptions underlying the 
two adaptation scenarios developed for this 
study were arbitrary, but we believe that they 
capture a reasonable range of potential future 
adaptation, from modest (20%) to substantial 
(80%). More data over a longer time period 
will be needed to determine which end of this 
range is most realistic.
Although we believe that the assumptions 
of the demographic models developed for 
this work are reasonable, they are based on 
historical trends that may or may not continue. 
Population projections are rarely developed 
beyond several decades, particularly on a 
fine, city-level geographical scale. Given the 
increasing importance of projecting popula-
tion health impacts under a changing climate, 
additional work focused on developing and 
validating long-term population projections 
will be of critical importance for improving the 
accuracy of projecting heat-related mortality 
and other health impacts. Nevertheless, by 
including five different population scenarios, 
our study is among the first to examine 
 
sensitivity to this important assumption.
Conclusion
The methods and findings of this study may be 
particularly relevant to estimating heat-related 
mortality in cities currently experiencing heat 
impacts and increasing urbanization with or 
without population growth. Because the choice 
of adaptation scenario substantially affected 
the number of projected heat-related deaths, 
improved understanding of heat adaptation 
is necessary in order to refine projections. 
Nonetheless, the substantial reduction of heat-
related mortality, particularly under the high-
adaptation scenario, provides evidence of the 
importance of public policy measures leading 
to continuous heat adaptation. Finally, the 
number of median annual heat-related deaths 
calculated across all models under RCP8.5 was 
in many instances more than twice as high as 
the number of deaths projected under RCP4.5. 
This difference highlights the magnitude of 
the potential public health benefit associated 
with reducing greenhouse gas concentrations 
in the atmosphere.

Heat adaptation scenarios include a) “high adaptation”: adaptation, as measured by RRmin or the minimal relative risk 
for a given temperature to be reached by the year 2100, projected to reach a value 80% lower than RR calculated at 
each degree Celsius (°C) during the 2000s; b) “low adaptation”: adaptation, as measured by RRmin or the minimal relative 
risk for a given temperature to be reached by the year 2100, projected to reach a value 20% lower than RR calculated 
at each degree Celsius during the 2000s; and c) “no adaptation”: future adaptation does not occur. Adaptation, as 
measured by RRmin or the minimal relative risk for a given temperature to be reached by the year 2100, remains the same 
as the RR calculated at each degree Celsius during the 2000s. Population scenarios included the following: a) “baseline” 
assumed that all parameters of the model remain constant; that is, age-specific fertility and mortality rates and age 
characteristics of migration are all kept constant, but the population ages forward; b) “decreased mortality” assumed 
a decrease in age-specific mortality rates such that the values reach 2/3 of the 2010 values by 2100; c) “increased 
in-migration” assumed that the growth of the domestic in-migration (from other parts of the United States to New York 
City) will be half of the growth of the U.S. population and that the growth of the international in-migration (from outside 
of the United States to New York City) will be half of the growth of the projected international in-migration nationwide; 
d) “increased out-migration” assumed that the rate of out-migration would increase by 25% over the projection period; 
and e) “constant” assumed that population and age of the population remain constant at the 2010 levels. For reference, 
there were 638 heat-related deaths annually between 2000 and 2006.
