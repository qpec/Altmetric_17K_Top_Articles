IMPORTANCE High-intensity statin therapy is recommended for the secondary prevention of
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Nevertheless, statin therapy in general, and
high-intensity statin therapy in particular, is underused in patients with established ASCVD.
OBJECTIVE To determine the association between all-cause mortality and intensity of statin
therapy in the Veterans Affairs health care system.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted of
patients aged 21 to 84 years with ASCVD treated in the Veterans Affairs health care system
from April 1, 2013, to April 1, 2014. Patients who were included had 1 or more International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes for ASCVD on 2 or more different dates in the
prior 2 years.
EXPOSURES Intensity of statin therapy was defined by the 2013 American College of
Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, and use was defined as a filled
prescription in the prior 6 months. Patients were excluded if they were taking a higher statin
dose in the prior 5 years.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was death from all causes adjusted
for the propensity to receive high-intensity statins.
RESULTS The study sample included 509 766 eligible adults with ASCVD at baseline (mean
[SD] age, 68.5 [8.8] years; 499 598 men and 10 168 women), including 150 928 (29.6%)
receiving high-intensity statin therapy, 232 293 (45.6%) receiving moderate-intensity statin
therapy, 33 920 (6.7%) receiving low-intensity statin therapy, and 92 625 (18.2%) receiving
no statins. During a mean follow-up of 492 days, there was a graded association between
intensity of statin therapy and mortality, with 1-year mortality rates of 4.0% (5103 of 126 139)
for those receiving high-intensity statin therapy, 4.8% (9703 of 200 709) for those receiving
moderate-intensity statin therapy, 5.7% (1632 of 28 765) for those receiving low-intensity
statin therapy, and 6.6% (4868 of 73 728) for those receiving no statin (P < .001). After
adjusting for the propensity to receive high-intensity statins, the hazard ratio for mortality
was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.88-0.93) for those receiving high- vs moderate-intensity statins. The
magnitude of benefit of high- vs moderate-intensity statins was similar, for an incident cohort
hazard ratio of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.85-1.01). For patients aged 76 to 84 years, the hazard ratio
was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.87-0.95). Patients treated with maximal doses of high-intensity statins
had lower mortality (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.87-0.94) compared with those receiving
submaximal doses.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE We found a graded association between intensity of statin
therapy and mortality in a national sample of patients with ASCVD. High-intensity statins
were associated with a small but significant survival advantage compared with
moderate-intensity statins, even among older adults. Maximal doses of high-intensity statins
were associated with a further survival benefit.

S
tatin therapy remains the cornerstone for the preven-
tion of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).
Many large, randomized trials have shown that the use
of statins significantly reduces the likelihood of future cardio-
vascular events and mortality in diverse populations.1,2 De-
spite this finding, statins continue to be underused, even in
the populations at highest risk of cardiovascular events and
mortality.3-12
Trials have also provided support that higher-intensity
statin dosing may be more effective than lower-intensity statin
therapy at reducing future cardiovascular events.13-15 In fact,
compared with moderate-intensity statin therapy (pravasta-
tin, 40 mg), high-intensity statin therapy (atorvastatin, 80 mg)
showed a reduction in atherosclerosis progression in patients
with coronary artery disease.16 Use of maximal doses of high-
intensitystatins(atorvastatin,80mg,androsuvastatin,40mg)
similarlyresultedinregressionofatherosclerosisinalarge,ran-
domized trial in patients with coronary artery disease.17 Large
meta-analyses have confirmed the safety and efficacy of the
use of high-intensity statins to achieve very low levels of low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients with coro-
nary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease.2
In response to this growing body of evidence, the 2013
American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association
(ACC/AHA) Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol
to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults rec-
ommends against routine LDL-C targets and instead recom-
mends use of high-intensity statin therapy among all pa-
tients 75 years or younger with ASCVD.18 This paradigm shift
has resulted in significant controversy as health care profes-
sionals determine the best metrics for lipid performance
measuresandpatientoutcomes.5,19Theguidelinesdefinehigh-
intensity statins as rosuvastatin, 20 or 40 mg/d, and atorva-
statin, 40 or 80 mg/d, but do not offer recommendations on a
specific dose of these higher-intensity statins for patients with
ASCVD.18 On the other hand, the Veterans Affairs (VA) health
care system has released separate dyslipidemia guidelines that
recommend moderate-intensity statins for most patients with
ASCVD, citing insufficient evidence for recommending high-
intensity statin therapy except in some subgroups of patients
at high risk for ASCVD.20
We thus sought to determine 1-year cardiovascular mortal-
ity by intensity of statin therapy for patients with ASCVD in the
VA health care system and to assess whether any differences in
mortalityassociatedwithintensityofstatintreatment,ifpresent,
were observed in different age groups of patients.
Methods
Study Population
Our study population included all outpatients within the VA
health system between ages 21 and 84 years with established
ASCVD, defined as coronary artery disease (International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision [ICD-9] codes 410-
414), cerebrovascular disease (ICD-9 codes 430-438), or
peripheral artery disease (ICD-9 code 440), identified quar-
terly from April 1, 2013, through April 1, 2014, with at least
1 ICD-9 code for ASCVD on at least 2 different dates and at
least 1 outpatient visit in the VA health system during the
study period in the prior 2 years. Patients with LDL-C levels
of less than 50 mg/dL or more than 600 mg/dL (to convert to
millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259) were excluded from
the analyses. Patients were excluded if they filled no pre-
scriptions from a VA health system clinician during the
6 months prior to the index date (42 363 [5%]), as this group
of patients with ASCVD likely represents those receiving
most of their primary or cardiovascular care outside the VA
health system. To limit patients intolerant of statins and
include patients receiving a stable dosage of statins, we
excluded patients currently receiving a moderate-intensity
statin who had previously been prescribed (in the prior
5 years) a higher-intensity statin, which excluded 70 439
patients (21%) receiving moderate-intensity statins, 30 377
receiving low-intensity statins (43%), and 127 921 of those
not receiving a statin (48%). As a sensitivity analysis, we
defined an incident cohort that included only patients with a
first prescription for a statin in the prior 6 months. The study
was approved by the Stanford University Institutional
Review Panel for Human Subjects, which waived the need
for patient consent.
Statin Classification
Intensity of statin therapy was classified according to the
ACC/AHA cholesterol guidelines.18 Statin use was defined as
a statin prescription filled in the prior 6 months. For ex-
ample, a patient identified from the January 1, 2014, cohort
with 2 codes for ASCVD from January 1, 2012, through Decem-
ber 31, 2013, was defined as receiving statin therapy if a statin
prescription was filled between July 1 and December 31, 2013.
If a patient was identified in more than 1 cohort, we used the
datafromtheirfirstidentification.Low-intensitystatintherapy
was defined as fluvastatin, 20 to 40 mg, lovastatin, 20 mg,
simvastatin, 10 mg, pitavastatin, 1 mg, and pravastatin, 10 to
20 mg. Moderate-intensity statin therapy was defined as ator-
vastatin, 10 to 20 mg, fluvastatin, 40 mg twice a day or 80 mg
once a day (extended-release formulation), lovastatin, 40 mg,
pitavastatin, 2 to 4 mg, pravastatin, 40 to 80 mg, rosuvasta-
tin, 5 to 10 mg, and simvastatin, 20 to 40 mg. High-intensity
Key Points
Question Is intensity of statin therapy associated with all-cause
mortality in a large national sample of patients in the Veterans
Affairs health care system with atherosclerotic cardiovascular
disease?
Findings In this cohort study of 509 766 patients with
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, there was an inverse
association between intensity of statin therapy and mortality, with
the greatest 1-year mortality reductions for patients receiving
high-intensity statins. These findings were consistent across
multiple subgroups, including adults older than 75 years.
Meaning Maximally tolerated doses of high-intensity statins may
confer a survival advantage to patients with atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease, including older adults.

statin therapy was defined as atorvastatin, 40 to 80 mg, or ro-
suvastatin, 20 to 40 mg. Although there were no new prescrip-
tions for simvastatin, 80 mg, patients who continued to take
this dose were included in the high-intensity statin group since
thisstatindosagetypicallylowersLDL-Clevelsbynearly50%.21
If patients were prescribed more than 1 type of statin during
the prior 6 months, the highest intensity and dose were used
in the analyses.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was all-cause mortality during a mean
follow-up of 492 days. Secondary outcomes were 1-year mor-
tality, 1-year hospitalization for any cause, acute myocardial
infarction, ischemic cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary disease, and malignant neoplasms. All-cause
mortalityduringfollow-upwasextractedfromtheVAVitalSta-
tus file. Survival was evaluated at 1 year and throughout the
available follow-up period using Cox proportional hazards re-
gression analyses. Incident diabetes (type 1 and type 2) was de-
fined as having at least 1 ICD-9 code for diabetes during the fol-
low-up period when there were no codes for diabetes in the
prior 2 years.
Our main subgroups of interest were patients older than
75 years and 75 years or younger. We repeated the analysis of
outcomes separately in these groups.
Patient and Hospital Characteristics
Race/ethnicity was self-reported in the VA health system rec-
ords. Participants were classified as white, Hispanic, black,
Asian, Pacific Islander, or other race. Participant age and sex
were also included. High-intensity statin use by ASCVD clas-
sification, including coronary artery disease, peripheral
artery disease, and cerebrovascular disease, was also
assessed. Clinical comorbidities included the presence of
heart failure, diabetes, hypertension, or renal disease. Mean
LDL-C levels were compared between each of the statin
intensity groups and were adjusted for in the regression
models. To account for adherence to statin therapy in our
adjustment model, medication possession ratios were calcu-
lated by dividing the number of days of outpatient statin
supplied during a 2-month period divided by the number of
days not hospitalized and alive during the 12-month
period.22 This total was multiplied by 100% and expressed
as a percentage. A medication possession ratio during
follow-up was calculated for all patients taking a statin dur-
ing follow-up regardless of their baseline statin use.
Hospital characteristics were obtained from the Ameri-
can Hospital Association database. These characteristics in-
cluded geographical region (divided into Northeast, Mid-
west, South, and West) and academic teaching status, defined
asmembershipintheCouncilofTeachingHospitalsandHealth
Systems (COTH).
Statistical Analysis
All statistical testing was 2-sided, with P < .05 considered sig-
nificant. Analyses were performed using SAS statistical soft-
ware (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc). Baseline characteristics
of participants were compared by use of statins (no statin, low
intensity, moderate intensity, and high intensity) using either
analysis of variance for continuous variables or the χ2 test for
categorical variables.
Missing race/ethnicity was treated as a separate category.
Missing laboratory test values were imputed with the mean by
statincategory.MissinghospitalCOTHdatawereimputedusing
the most common category. For multivariable analyses, we im-
puted continuous variables using the mean and most com-
mon value for categorical variables.
We performed unadjusted Cox proportional hazards
regression analysis to determine the association of high-
intensity statin use with survival. We then modeled the pro-
pensity to receive a high-intensity statin prescription using
all available patient-level and facility variables, including
demographics (age, sex, and race/ethnicity), Charlson
Comorbidity Score (prior myocardial infarction, peripheral
artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, heart fail-
ure, renal disease, liver disease, pulmonary disease, connec-
tive tissue disease, hemiparesis, malignant neoplasms
[including metastases], and AIDS), filled prescriptions (an-
giotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin
receptor blockers), laboratory test values (baseline LDL-C,
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, tri-
glycerides, and creatinine), region of the country, COTH
membership, and time period for entry into the cohort (year
and quarter). The Cox proportional hazards regression analy-
sis was then repeated using inverse probability weighting
with the propensity score. Adjusted survival curves were
created with weighting using the propensity score. The main
comparison of interest was confounding between the groups
receiving high- and moderate-intensity statins (other charac-
teristics associated with mortality may lead to not prescrib-
ing a statin or prescribing it in low doses). In a sensitivity
analysis, we further adjusted for potential clustering of
patients within VA health system facilities using a robust
sandwich covariance matrix estimate. Secondary outcomes
(1-year death rates and several 1-year hospitalization rates)
were also adjusted using inverse probability weighting with
the propensity score to receive a high-intensity statin pre-
scription. An additional adjusted Cox proportional hazards
regression analysis was limited to patients receiving high-
intensity statin therapy and examined survival for those
receiving a maximal dose of high-intensity statin therapy
(atorvastatin, 80 mg, or rosuvastatin, 40 mg) compared with
those receiving a submaximal dose (atorvastatin, 40 mg, or
rosuvastatin, 20 mg).
Results
Patient Characteristics and Adherence
We identified 509 766 adults with documented ASCVD
(mean [SD] age, 68.5 [8.8] years) who had not had their
statin dose lowered. This cohort included 150 928 patients
(29.6%) receiving high-intensity statin therapy, 232 293
(45.6%) receiving moderate-intensity statin therapy, 33 920
(6.7%) receiving low-intensity statin therapy, and 92 625

high-intensity statin therapy were slightly younger, more
likely to be male, and of white race compared with patients
receiving other doses of statins. Adherence to statin therapy
during the subsequent 12 months ranged from 81% to 83% as
measured by medication possession ratios. Baseline charac-
teristics of patients with ASCVD by statin intensity after
weighting by propensity score showed similar results (eTable
in the Supplement).
Mortality
Patients receiving high-intensity statin therapy had a 1-year
mortality rate of 4.0% compared with 4.8% for those receiv-
ing moderate-intensity statin therapy, 5.7% (1632 of 28 765)
for those receiving low-intensity statin therapy, and 6.6%
(4868 of 73 728) for those receiving no statin therapy
(P < .001). After adjusting for the propensity to receive a
high-intensity statin prescription, similar patterns of sur-
vival were observed during a mean follow-up of 492 days
(median, 147 days) (Figure 1).
High- vs Moderate-Intensity Statins
When the sample was limited to patients receiving high- or
moderate-intensity statins, the unadjusted hazard ratio for
mortality was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.80-0.84) for those taking high-
intensity statins vs those taking moderate-intensity statins
(Table 2). After adjustment using inverse probability weight-
ing of the propensity to receive a high-intensity statin, the as-
sociation with mortality and high-intensity statin use was at-
tenuated but remained significant (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% CI,
0.88-0.93). Adjustment for potential clustering of patients
withinVAhealthsystemfacilitiesproducedsimilarresults(haz-
ard ratio, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.88-0.93).

When the sample was further limited to patients receiv-
ing high-intensity statins, those treated with maximal doses
(atorvastatin, 80 mg, or rosuvastatin, 40 mg) had a lower
mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.87-0.94)
compared with those receiving submaximal doses (atorva-
statin, 40 mg, rosuvastatin, 20 mg, and simvastatin, 80 mg).
Other Outcomes
Table 2 shows unadjusted and adjusted outcomes at 1 year for
mortality,hospitalization,andanewdiagnosisofdiabetes.The
results suggest that patients receiving high-intensity statins
were more likely to have more severe coronary artery disease
(higher risk of acute myocardial infarction) but slightly less
likely to have malignant neoplasms. These differences were
attenuated but persisted with adjustment. There was no sig-
nificant difference in new diagnosis of diabetes, admission for
pulmonary disease, or admission for stroke. The effect sizes
were similar for the incident cohort, but these differences were
not significant except for 1-year mortality.
Age Groups
The primary and secondary outcomes (adjusted for the pro-
pensity to receive a high-intensity statin) for those 75 years or
younger and those between 76 and 84 years are shown in
Table 3 and Figure 2. In general, the directions of the effects
of high-intensity statins were similar for both age groups ex-
cept for malignant neoplasms, with hospitalizations for ma-
lignant neoplasms more common for patients in the younger
group receiving moderate-intensity statins (Table 3).
Incident Cohort
When the cohort was limited to patients with a first prescrip-
tion for a statin within the prior 6 months, the sample size was
decreased by 91.6% (14 454 patients receiving high-intensity
statins and 28 168 receiving moderate-intensity statins). The
propensity-weighted hazard ratio for mortality with high-
intensity statins in this incident cohort was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.85-
1.01) (Table 2).
Discussion
In this national study of patients in the VA health system, we
found a consistent, graded association between intensity of
statin therapy and mortality, with the greatest reductions for
patients receiving high-intensity statins. We also found that

the maximal doses of high-intensity statins (atorvastatin,
80 mg, and rosuvastatin, 40 mg) conferred the greatest sur-
vival advantage compared with submaximal doses of high-
intensity statins. The benefits of high-intensity statins were
consistentforthoseolderthan75yearscomparedwithyounger
patients.
Despite the growing evidence that statins consistently im-
prove outcomes for the secondary prevention of ASCVD, these
medications continue to be underused in clinical practice.23-27
Although the reasons for this underuse are not clear, one cause
may be an assumption that higher-intensity statins do not con-
fer an important benefit.
Since the release of the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol
guidelines,18moreattentionhasbeenplacedontheuseofhigh-
vs moderate-intensity statins. However, the VA dyslipidemia
practice guidelines,20 which were released following the
ACC/AHA guidelines, favor the use of moderate-intensity stat-
ins, even for secondary prevention, concluding that the evi-
dence for use of high-intensity statins is lacking, with a con-
sideration for titration to high-intensity statins among patients
withrecurrentcoronaryarterydiseaseorthosewithacutecoro-
nary syndrome. Our finding that high-intensity statins were
associated with a significant survival benefit compared with
moderate-intensity statins instead supports the use of high-
intensity statins for patients with ASCVD, as recommended by
the ACC/AHA guidelines. As documented in the landmark
PROVE IT-TIMI 22 (Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and
Infection Therapy–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 22)13
and TNT (Treating to New Targets)15 randomized clinical trials,
high-intensity statins are more efficacious at reducing cardio-
vascular end points compared with moderate-intensity
statins.13-15 Our study found that, when examined separately,
CVD and non-CVD mortality were each associated with a com-
parablenonsignificantreductioninmortality.Wecanpositthat
the observed mortality risk reduction is mostly attributable to
reductions in LDL-C levels, although reduction in inflamma-
tion may play an additional role and may lead to both im-
proved CVD and non-CVD mortality. The maximal doses of
high-intensity statins conferred the greatest mortality advan-
tage, supporting the notion that physicians should prescribe
the maximally tolerated doses of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin
for patients with ASCVD.

The finding that adults older than 75 years are also more
likely to benefit from high- vs moderate-intensity statins and
that maximum high-intensity dosing was associated with
greater survival than submaximal high-intensity dosing in this
age group warrants special mention. The ACC/AHA choles-
terolguidelines18recommenduseofhigh-intensitystatinsonly
up to age 75 years given the inadequacy of existing data for
older adults, with no clinical trials including adults older than
80 years.28,29 The ACC/AHA guidelines18 argue that there is no
clear additional benefit from the use of high- vs moderate-
intensity statins for patients older than 75 years. In addition,
there is concern among health care professionals about geri-
atric-specific adverse effects of high-intensity statins, includ-
ing myalgias and drug-drug interactions. Ko and colleagues30
have coined this dilemma the treatment-risk paradox, high-
lighting that patients at the greatest cardiovascular risk should
be,butareoftennot,treatedmostaggressively.Physiciansmay
overemphasize the risk of treatment in the elderly, particu-
larly in the setting of multiple comorbidities.31,32 Our find-
ings suggest that high-risk older adults may experience a sur-
vival benefit from treatment with high-intensity statins,
although drug adverse effects must be considered on an indi-
vidual basis and should be part of the risk discussion be-
tween a patient and a health care professional.
Our study has several strengths, including our sample size
and the use of a large, well-characterized patient cohort from
the VA health system, which offers a unique opportunity to
study both administrative and clinical variables. We ex-
cluded a large number of patients who were previously treated
with high-intensity statins, which helped to exclude patients
who may be intolerant of high-intensity statins. However, we
were unable to fully adjust for potential confounders, which
likely affected our results, which suggests that patients treated
with high-intensity statins were at higher risk of coronary
eventscomparedwiththosereceivingmoderate-intensitystat-
ins, given that we observed a small but significantly higher rate
of admission for acute myocardial infarction in those receiv-
ing high-intensity statins. We were also unable to determine
the cause of death. Although most studies of secondary pre-
vention have consistently shown a reduction in coronary heart
disease deaths with statins, in the PROVE-IT TIMI 22 trial13
among patients receiving high-intensity statins, deaths not as-
sociated with coronary heart disease were reduced to a simi-
lar degree (27%) as deaths associated with coronary heart dis-
ease(30%).13Bothdifferenceswereindividuallynonsignificant
but together produced a significant decrease in total mortal-
ity. In addition, we were unable to determine if patients re-
ceived statin treatment outside of the VA health system, al-
though we excluded patients who did not fill a nonstatin
medication prescription 6 months before the index period of
interest. This limitation would likely bias our results toward
the null. We adjusted for baseline LDL-C levels, which may bias
the results toward the null, as higher-intensity treatment will
lead to lower LDL-C values at baseline. Medication posses-
sion ratios were used as a proxy for adherence, although, as
with all pharmacy databases, we can only determine if the pre-
scription was dispensed and not if the patient actually took the
medication. Medication possession ratios have a high speci-
ficity for medication adherence and are widely used in the
literature.22 Since we relied on ICD-9 administrative codes for
diagnosis of ASCVD, coding errors may have affected our find-
ings, although these errors are likely to be nondifferential by
statin intensity group. Furthermore, our mean duration of fol-
low-up was less than 2 years, yet during that period, we were
able to detect significant differences in mortality by intensity
of statin therapy.
Conclusions
We evaluated the real-world practice of statin use by inten-
sity and its association with all-cause mortality in a national
sample of patients with ASCVD in the VA health system. We
found an inverse graded association between intensity of
statin therapy and mortality. These findings suggest there is
a substantial opportunity for improvement in the secondary
prevention of ASCVD through optimization of intensity of
statin therapy.
