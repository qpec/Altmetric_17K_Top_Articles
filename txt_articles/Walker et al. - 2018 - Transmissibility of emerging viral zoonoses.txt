Abstract
Effective public health research and preparedness requires an accurate understanding of
which virus species possess or are at risk of developing human transmissibility. Unfortu-
nately, our ability to identify these viruses is limited by gaps in disease surveillance and an
incomplete understanding of the process of viral adaptation. By fitting boosted regression
trees to data on 224 human viruses and their associated traits, we developed a model that
predicts the human transmission ability of zoonotic viruses with over 84% accuracy. This
model identifies several viruses that may have an undocumented capacity for transmission
between humans. Viral traits that predicted human transmissibility included infection of non-
human primates, the absence of a lipid envelope, and detection in the human nervous sys-
tem and respiratory tract. This predictive model can be used to prioritize high-risk viruses for
future research and surveillance, and could inform an integrated early warning system for
emerging infectious diseases.
Introduction
Zoonotic viruses pose major threats to human health [1–5]. These viruses, which emerge from
animal reservoirs, can cause epidemics that require substantial resources for containment [6,
7] if sustained human-to-human transmission occurs. Even limited outbreaks from stuttering
chains of secondary (human to human) transmission can overwhelm local health systems and
undermine social and political stability [4, 8, 9]. Recent outbreak responses have been largely
reactive, rather than preemptive, often resulting in inefficient action and costly delays [9].
Developing a more proactive strategy for spillover prevention will require novel predictive
tools [10].
Animal viruses must pass through a series of highly selective evolutionary bottlenecks to
become established in the human population [11]. First, the host species barrier selects for
viruses that establish successful infections in exposed humans [11, 12]. The next bottleneck
selects for viruses capable of relatively efficient human-to-human transmission. This efficiency
can be measured by the pathogen’s basic reproduction number, R0, defined as the mean num-
ber of secondary infections propagated by an initial case in an immunologically naïve popula-
tion. Selection for variants with higher R0 values produces viruses capable of more sustained

 transmission within the new human population [12]. During this process, two discrete thresh-
olds can be defined: first, whether or not an animal virus can infect humans, and second,
whether or not a zoonotic infection can be transmitted between humans. To supplement
knowledge on the first threshold, animal-to-human spillover, several data-driven models have
been used to predict undiscovered zoonotic viruses, potential vectors [13, 14], and animal res-
ervoirs [15–17]. With regards to the second threshold, a descriptive statistical analysis by Geo-
ghegan et al found that human transmissibility was generally associated with low host
mortality, chronic infection, non-segmented genomes, and the lack of an insect vector [18].
In this study, we use a predictive machine learning model to identify specific virus species
that may have undocumented potential for human-to-human transmission. The tree-based
machine learning method we employ in this analysis, known as gradient boosted regression
trees, offers a number of distinct advantages over more parametric statistical models. Boosted
regression trees accommodate diverse data types and are robust to hidden interactions, miss-
ing data, and co-linearities among variables (e.g., correlated viral traits that arose through
shared evolutionary history) [19, 20]. Additionally, a machine learning approach also allows us
to model and interpret complex nonlinear relationships between predictor variables and the
response, which can be obscured in parametric regression models. Finally, these methods
identify viruses that best fit the trait profile of a zoonotic virus with secondary transmission in
humans, giving more precise targets (particular viruses, or viral clades) for surveillance and
future research.
Results
Consolidating records from the primary literature and existing pathogen databases yielded a
list of 224 virus species known to infect humans. For each virus, we collected data on taxo-
nomic grouping and 19 biological features (S1 Table), 16 of which do not have a counterpart
in previous analyses [18, 18]. We then assigned each virus a binary score denoting whether or
not it was known to be transmissible between humans; non-transmissible viruses received a
score of 0, while viruses transmitted directly, via an arthropod vector, or through environmen-
tal contamination received a score of 1. Fitting boosted regression trees to this data produced
an ensemble of models that identify strong predictors of human transmissibility (Fig 1) and
accurately discriminate transmissible from non-transmissible viruses: among zoonotic viruses,
models distinguished those with observed secondary transmission with ~84% accuracy
(median AUC = 0.8430 +/- 0.0778); when applied across all human viruses (zoonotic and non-
zoonotic), the model achieved even higher accuracy (median AUC = 0.9196 +/- 0.0353), dem-
onstrating that zoonotic viruses with secondary transmission are easily distinguishable from
all other human viruses on the basis of observable viral traits (Fig 2). AUC scores, tuning
parameters, and the relative influence of covariates are reported in S2 Table. We used partial
dependence plots to characterize the relationships between predictor variables and transmissi-
bility in our model (Fig 3).
Our models identified certain non-human hosts of zoonotic viruses as strong predictors of
secondary human transmissibility. Zoonoses carried by nonhuman primates were more likely
to be transmissible between humans than other zoonotic viruses, while viruses found in
rodents and birds were less likely to be transmissible. Arthropod-borne viruses also showed a
significantly reduced probability of being transmissible between humans compared to directly
transmitted viruses, corroborating previous findings [18]. Only 13.21% of the arboviruses in
our dataset were also transmissible between humans, compared to 76.61% of non-vector-
borne viruses.

 Virus presence in certain human tissues was also predictive of human transmissibility in
our model. Virus detection in the liver, the central nervous system, and the upper and lower
respiratory tracts was associated with an increased likelihood of transmission between
humans. The respiratory tracts support successful viral entry and establishment, as they place a
large surface area of exposed mucosal membrane in direct contact with the environment [21,
22]. As the livers and central nervous systems of living patients are relatively inaccessible to
diagnosticians, false negatives among under-sampled viral zoonoses could bias the observed
relationships between viral presence in these locations and transmission ability.
A number of structural features were also associated with human transmissibility, including
the absence of a lipid envelope, small virus particle size (< 75 nanometers (nm) in diameter),
and limited genome segmentation (� 2 segments). These relationships have been identified in
a previous analysis [18]. Non-enveloped virions are often more stable in the extra-host envi-
ronment than enveloped particles, and can therefore remain infectious in the air, in water, and
on surfaces for longer periods of time [23]. This corroborates previous findings [18]. The ele-
vated stability of non-enveloped viruses could partially explain the association between smaller

influence of each predictor variable was computed using Friedman’s algorithm 45. This figure shows the average of these scores (mean relative influence) for each
predictor variable in our dataset that was included in at least one model of the ensemble (mean relative influence > 0). Horizontal lines represent the interval formed

 virion size and human transmission in Fig 3, since the lipid envelope contributes to the diame-
ter of the virion; in our dataset, the average diameter of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses
was 109 and 52 nm, respectively. The negative relationship that we observed in our models
between number of genome segments and transmission likelihood does not contradict Geo-
ghegan et al, which classified genome segmentation as a binary variable and found that seg-
mented viruses are collectively less likely to be transmissible between humans [18].
Although many viral features, including genome length and strandedness, are phylogeneti-
cally conserved, only 11 of 104 (10.6%) binary family and genus variables were estimated to
have non-zero relative influence in any model, with a combined mean relative influence of
only 2.66% (S2 Table). We did not observe significant changes in AUC scores or the trait pro-
file after removing taxonomy variables from the model (S2 Table), suggesting that the covari-
ates in our model capture the majority of the important family- and genus-wide traits that
underpin secondary human transmission.
Using our primary model ensemble, we ranked viruses by their mean predicted probability
of being transmissible between humans (Fig 2 and S3 Table). Of the 85 human viruses not

models. This model ensemble accurately discriminates transmissible and non-transmissible viruses, as illustrated by the lack of “overlap” of the two groups in the rank-
ordering. The highest ranked viruses that are not currently known to be transmissible between humans were Carnivore amdoparvovirus 1, Hendra virus, Cardiovirus A,
Rosavirus A, Human T-lymphotropic viruses 3 & 4 (HTLV-3/4), and Simian Foamy virus. Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus was the lowest ranked species for

 currently known to spread between humans, 47 were assigned higher probabilities than Cri-
mean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, the lowest ranked species with known transmissibility
between humans. Within this subset, the viruses with the highest probability of secondary
human transmission were Carnivore amdoparvovirus 1 [24], Hendra virus [25], Cardiovirus
A [26, 27], Rosavirus A [28], HTLV-3 and 4 [29], and Simian Foamy virus [30]. These patho-
gens may be predisposed to developing human-to-human transmissibility, and some may
already be capable of transmission between humans, as underreporting and misdiagnosis of
infections often allow viruses to spread unobserved [31]. Future epidemiologic studies of these
pathogens should make efforts to identify potential human-to-human transmission.
To determine the potential influence of study bias, we created a separate ensemble of mod-
els, trained on the same data-splits as the models in our primary ensemble, that included the
log-transformed number of PubMed citations for each virus as a predictor, a measure of
research effort. Study effort was relatively influential in these models (mean relative

 influence = 20.685, 2nd highest of all predictors), but its inclusion did not improve overall pre-
dictive performance, and the rankings of the most influential variables were highly similar
between the two ensembles (Kendall rank-order correlation = 0.929). Comparing partial
dependence plots between the two ensembles shows that including study effort as a predictor
does not meaningfully alter the predicted trait profile of transmissible viruses (S1 Fig). Fur-
thermore, rankings of individual virus species by their predicted transmission probability were
similar between models that do and do not include study effort, with a Kendall rank-order cor-
relation of 0.86. These comparisons suggest that the primary model ensemble is not severely
confounded by study bias.
In this analysis, viruses capable of spreading between humans directly, environmentally, or
through an intermediate arthropod vector are labeled as “transmissible.” To assess the robust-
ness of our findings to different definitions of the “transmissible” label, we fit a separate
ensemble of GBM models with a modified response variable definition. For these models, we
labeled viruses as “transmissible” (binary response = 1) if they are capable of spreading
between humans directly or through the environmental, while viruses that are not known to
spread between humans at all or require an intermediate vector to spread are classified as
“non-transmissible” (binary response = 0). This change in definition had the effect of reclassi-
fying the response of 5 arbovirus species (chikungunya, yellow fever, dengue, o’nyong-nyong,
and Oropouche) from “transmissible” to “non-transmissible”. The rankings of predictors by
mean relative influence were almost identical between ensembles (Kendall rank-order correla-
tion = 0.985), and a comparison of partial dependence plots shows that the trait profiles of
directly transmissible viruses and transmissible viruses as a whole do not significantly differ
(Fig 3 and S2 Fig).
Not all viruses were accurately classified by our model. In particular, some viruses with
known human-to-human transmissibility were assigned a low predicted transmission proba-
bility (Fig 2). The 10 human-transmissible viruses with the lowest predicted response values
belong to 5 families: Bunyaviridae, Togaviridae, Arenaviridae, Flaviviridae, and Poxviridae (S3
Table). These families contain relatively high numbers of individual virus species, few of which
are known to be transmissible between humans (S3 Fig). Further molecular characterization of
these viruses may identify factors that distinguish human-to-human transmissible “outlier”
viruses from their non-transmissible relatives.
Discussion
These results are subject to two key qualifications. First, by considering viruses at the species
level, our approach does not account for variation in human transmissibility within individual
species. For example, the H1N1 subtype of Influenza A has caused several human pandemics
[32], whereas the H3N8 subtype within the same species primarily infects dogs and horses,
and has never been isolated from humans [33]. Second, our approach does not consider the
efficiency of observed human transmission per se, and handles viruses with supercritical (R0 >
1) and subcritical (0 < R0 < 1) transmission identically. Future research aiming to preempt
novel viral spillover events will depend on building mechanistic understanding at these smaller
scales.
In this study, we show that the human-to-human transmissibility of zoonotic viruses can be
predicted with a high degree of accuracy by ensembles of machine learning models trained on
observed viral features. This data-driven modeling framework could allow public health work-
ers to broadly characterize the epidemic risk posed by novel viral pathogens. Linking these
models with those trained to predict the zoonotic capacity of animal viruses [15] could provide
a data-driven method for focusing broad-scale virome sampling projects.

 Our model ensemble predicts that zoonoses carried by nonhuman primates are more likely
to be transmissible between humans relative to other zoonotic viruses, while viruses found in
rodents and birds are less likely to be transmissible. This corroborates current theories on viral
emergence, which posit that both phylogenetic and physical proximity between human and
animal hosts drives spillover events and the success of subsequent adaptations [34–36]. Closer
phylogenetic relationships between hosts generally correspond to physiological and molecular
similarities that allow secondary transmission in a new host species to occur with less extensive
viral adaptation [2, 3, 12, 34, 36]. In contrast, for viruses that infect phylogenetically distant
hosts, beneficial adaptations to one host system can significantly reduce pathogen fitness in
the others, impeding the evolution of transmissibility within the new host population due to
adaptive trade-offs [34, 36, 37]. However, close physical proximity can increase contact rates
between humans and more distantly related host species, creating additional opportunities for
spillover. While genetic dissimilarities may initially inhibit the development of secondary
transmissibility in humans, increased contact creates more opportunities for successful viral
adaptation [21, 38].
The negative association between arthropod vector infection and human-to-human trans-
missibility in our model ensemble suggests that arboviruses, none of which exclusively infect
humans, are significantly constrained by the evolutionary trade-offs needed to infect both phy-
logenetically divergent arthropod vectors and vertebrate host species [34, 36, 39]. Viruses that
overcome this barrier most commonly circulate between nonhuman primate hosts and
anthropophilic vectors, again illustrating the importance of phylogenetic and physical proxim-
ity in successful viral emergence [2, 34, 36]. In contrast, the vast majority of arboviruses infect
genetically dissimilar organisms via zoophilic vectors, typically only infecting humans living in
close proximity with reservoir hosts. Humans are predominantly dead-end hosts for such
viruses.
Few quantitative studies have investigated the associations between viral traits and human
transmissibility. Our findings corroborate the results of one such study (Geoghegan et al [18])
in several important ways: both analyses found that DNA-based genomes were associated with
human transmission, while genome segmentation, presence of lipid envelopes, and associa-
tions with arthropod vectors predicted dead-end spillover. Beyond these physical attributes,
our model ensemble also shows how the human-to-human transmissibility of viral zoonoses is
shaped by ecological and evolutionary context, with virus isolation from non-human primates
and the human respiratory tract and CNS being positively associated with human transmission
(Fig 3). In our model ensemble, the variables describing the animal hosts and human organ
systems from which viruses have been isolated together account for over 38% of the overall
variable influence (Fig 1, S2 Table).
We demonstrate that a highly predictive model ensemble based on evolutionarily conserved
and readily observable viral characteristics informs the relative risks posed by different zoo-
notic virus species, and identifies optimal targets for research and surveillance efforts.
Methods
Data
We compiled data on all viruses suspected to infect humans and candidate predictive features
associated with each viral species. Our list was initially derived from the viral pathogens listed
in GIDEON [40], ViralZone [41] and the Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR) [42]. We further
supplemented this list by searching the literature for publications describing additional viruses
which have had genetic material isolated from humans, obtaining a total of 224 viral species
recognized by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses [43]. We also extracted

 information from the literature on a variety of biological features, including the genetic and
structural attributes, animal hosts, arthropod vector status, and human tissue presence of each
virus, and encoded this data as 19 predictor variables (S1 Table). Because their histograms
showed highly skewed distributions, we log-transformed the variable for number or genome
segments. To measure the influence of taxonomic grouping on transmission ability, we
included each unique family and genus (using the taxonomic groupings recognized by the
International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses [43]) represented among our list of human
viruses as 104 separate binary variables, for a total of 123 predictor variables. This dataset con-
tains no missing or incomplete values (100% data coverage), and to our knowledge is more
extensive in the number of viruses and viral features than past studies of the association
between pathogen traits and transmission ability [18].
Based on published epidemiological information, we assigned a binary response variable to
indicate whether or not there is evidence of human-to-human transmission for each virus.
Our operational definition of “transmissible virus” is a pathogen which has spread via direct
contact with an infectious human, as well as viruses which may be indirectly transmitted
between humans through an intermediate arthropod vector or environmental source (i.e.,
transmission through the fecal-oral route or following contact with surface fomites). This defi-
nition does not encompass infection resulting from organ transplantation.
Cross-reactivity between antigenically related viral species can produce false positives in
serological tests, so we only used the 224 virus species that have had genetic material isolated
from humans to perform our analysis. All exploratory analysis and data transformations were
conducted in R [44].
Analysis
Of the 224 virus species confirmed to infect humans, we randomly selected 80% and 20% to
create the training and testing sets, respectively. We repeated this process to create 40 unique
data-splits, and built our primary model ensemble by fitting a single model to each unique
training set using the gradient boosting machine (GBM). The GBM fits a boosted regression
tree comprising a sequence of decision trees [19, 20]. Within each tree, predictors are associ-
ated with the response (here, a binary indicator of human-to-human transmission) by recur-
sively breaking down the total pool of training observations by randomly selected splitting
variables. At each step (or “split”), groups become smaller and more homogeneous. After a
specified number of splits, the mean response of each group is recorded and assigned to the
associated terminal node. This process is iterated to create a set of thousands of trees. Our
models were built with 5500 trees and specify a Bernoulli error distribution for the binary
response variable. We applied ten-fold cross validation during the fitting process to prevent
overfitting. To further investigate the effect of phylogeny on transmissibility, we built and ana-
lyzed a second ensemble of 40 models that did not include any taxonomy variables. All parti-
tioning, model building and subsequent analysis was done in R [44] using the GBM package
[45].
The structure of these tree ensembles was analyzed to gain insight into the relationships
between predictor and response variables. To determine the relative contribution of each pre-
dictor to classification performance, we computed relative influence scores using Friedman’s
algorithm [46]. For each predictor variable in a given model, this algorithm sums the reduction
in error across all nodes in the collection of trees that use the variable for splitting within a sin-
gle model. These raw influence scores are then normalized as percentages and the average and
standard deviation of scores across all 40 models in the ensemble were derived. We also con-
structed partial dependence plots, which show the marginal impact of individual predictors on

 the model response by integrating over the influence of all other variables [19]. The plots that
we display in Fig 3 show the median effect across all 40 models in the primary ensemble, with
corresponding 95% confidence intervals.
To evaluate classification performance, we computed AUC scores for each model on its
associated testing and training partitions, and used these scores to derive the mean training
and testing AUC of the ensemble.
A central premise of our analysis is that our dataset may contain viruses that have an unob-
served ability to transmit between humans. These viruses are conservatively designated as
“non-transmissible” in our analysis to denote that human-to-human transmission has not
been observed, and also to minimize type II error (the error associated with classifying a
human transmissible virus as unable to transmit between humans). This designation is analo-
gous to the treatment of presence-absence data in ecology [47], and case-control data with
contaminated controls in econometrics [48]. The statistical literature on this problem shows
that while poorly calibrated probability estimates may be a consequence of contaminated con-
trols, the ratio of probabilities for pairs of viruses are not affected [47, 48]. Thus, AUC scores
and the rank ordering of virus species by their predicted response are not affected by the dis-
crepancy either.
To investigate the differences in predictive performance between our tree-based machine
learning approach and more rigid logistic regression models, we fit a comparable generalized
linear model (GLM) to each of the 40 train-test partitions. On average, testing AUC was higher
in the primary GBM models than the primary GLM models by 0.149. When evaluated by a
paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test, this provides statistically significant evidence at p < 0.00001
that the median of the distribution of testing AUC scores is greater for primary GBM models
than primary GLM models. When taxonomy variables were excluded from models, testing
AUC was higher in GLM models by an average of 0.001 relative to GBM models, a statistically
insignificant difference (p = 0.9808 under a Wilcoxon signed-rank test). These results indicate
that the predictive performance of our machine learning methodology is equivalent to or
greater than that of parametric logistic regression models in this situation.
