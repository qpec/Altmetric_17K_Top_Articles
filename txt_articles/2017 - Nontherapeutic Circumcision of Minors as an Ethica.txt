Nontherapeutic Circumcision of Minors as an Ethically Problematic Form of 
Iatrogenic Injury 
J. Steven Svoboda, Esq., MS, JD 
 
Abstract 
Nontherapeutic circumcision (NTC) of male infants and boys is a common 
but misunderstood form of iatrogenic injury that causes harm by 
removing functional tissue that has known erogenous, protective, and 
immunological properties, regardless of whether the surgery generates 
complications. I argue that the loss of the foreskin itself should be 
counted, clinically and morally, as a harm in evaluating NTC; that a 
comparison of benefits and risks is not ethically sufficient in an analysis 
of a nontherapeutic procedure performed on patients unable to provide 
informed consent; and that circumcision violates clinicians’ imperatives 
to respect patients’ autonomy, to do good, to do no harm, and to be just. 
When due consideration is given to these values, the balance of factors 
suggests that NTC should be deferred until the affected person can 
perform his own cost-benefit analysis, applying his mature, informed 
preferences and values. 
 
Introduction 
The foreskin is a complex genital structure that covers the head of the penis and 
performs a variety of sexual, immunological, and protective functions. With a total adult 
surface area of 30-50 cm2 [1, 2] and dense innervation, the foreskin is highly touch-
sensitive tissue [3]. Its contractible muscle fibers exclude contaminants [4], while its 
mucous surface provides a second, immunological layer of protection [5, 6]. The foreskin 
keeps the glans moist and facilitates a gliding action that promotes pleasurable sexual 
sensations [7-10]. 
 
The intact male and female genitalia have evolved to work together to optimize sexual 
sensation during sexual activity [7]. In the nineteenth century, British and American 
physicians introduced circumcision of boys (and also of girls) in a vain attempt to prevent 
masturbation [11]. American physicians came to view the male foreskin as the root of 
many medical and moral evils, believing that it contributed to conditions such as insanity, 
homosexuality, epilepsy, and deafness [12]. As each benefit of circumcision was shown 
to be false, new rationales were invented, and circumcision became entrenched as a 
cultural practice [12].

Nontherapeutic infant or child male circumcision (NTC)—the removal of a child’s foreskin 
in the absence of a valid medical indication—is an unnecessary surgery that causes pain, 
permanently alters the penis, and needlessly exposes a healthy child to risk of iatrogenic 
injury [13]. If a man assigns value to the foreskin itself, as most noncircumcised men do, 
the loss of this tissue constitutes a harm, regardless of whether there are surgical 
complications [14]. The American Academy of Pediatrics’ (AAP’s) 2012 position 
statement, which asserts that the health benefits of NTC outweigh the risks [15], is in 
conflict with a consensus of Northern European medical authorities [16]. As the AAP 
acknowledges, men rarely volunteer to undergo a circumcision [15]. Growing numbers of 
adult males are angry that the procedure was forced on them before they could decline 
[17, 18]. As will be demonstrated, removing healthy tissue from nonconsenting minors is 
inconsistent with widely accepted ethical norms. 
 
Benefit versus Risk of Harm Is the Correct Standard 
Although risks and benefits are commonly compared in evaluating circumcision, the risk-
benefit calculation was developed for therapeutic procedures and is not applicable to a 
nontherapeutic procedure, especially one that removes a genital structure with known 
functions [14]. The correct standard for evaluating nontherapeutic surgeries thus is not 
risk of surgical complications versus benefit but risk of harm versus benefit [14]. Insofar as 
the foreskin itself has value, its involuntary loss is a harm per se that must be included in 
the analysis. 
 
Other iatrogenic consequences of NTC include: 
• 
Trauma and pain. Topical anesthesia cannot fully protect an infant from 
substantial pain when circumcised [19, 20], while general anesthetics must 
be avoided due to high risks [21]. Many practitioners still do not use any form 
of pain control, although Lander et al. showed that in their study, “every 
newborn in the [non-anesthetized] placebo group exhibited extreme distress 
during and following circumcision” [22]. 
• 
Complications. Complications of circumcision, even when performed in a 
sterile clinical setting, are possible. Krill, Palmer, and Palmer state that 
“postcircumcision bleeding in patients with coagulation disorders can be 
significant and sometimes even fatal. Other serious early complications 
include chordee [curvature], iatrogenic hypospadias, glanular necrosis, and 
glanular amputation…. Late complications include epidermal inclusion cysts, 
suture sinus tracts, chordee, inadequate skin removal resulting in redundant 
foreskin, penile adhesions, phimosis [inability to retract the foreskin], buried 
penis, urethrocutaneous fistulae, meatitis [inflammation of the meatus], and 
meatal stenosis” [23]. 
• 
Sexual harm. Since circumcision removes between one-third and one-half of 
the highly innervated penile skin system, as well as the majority of the 
 AMA Journal of Ethics, August 2017 
817 
penis’s specialized erotogenic nerve endings [24], it inevitably compromises 
male sexual response. At minimum, all sexual activities and sensations 
involving manipulation of the foreskin are precluded by circumcision. One 
recent study of heterosexual men and women reported that “Circumcision 
was associated with frequent orgasm difficulties in Danish men and with a 
range of frequent sexual difficulties in women, notably orgasm difficulties, 
dyspareunia and a sense of incomplete sexual needs fulfilment” [25]. 
Another study found that erectile dysfunction and difficulty in reaching 
orgasm increased in circumcised men [26]. 
Without an unambiguous medical rationale to counterbalance the trauma and pain, risk 
of complications, and iatrogenic harm—including sexual harm—that results from 
circumcision, it is difficult to justify ethically. 
 
Benefits Do Not Outweigh Risks 
Evidence suggests that circumcision can reduce the risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs) 
[16] and (when performed in adulthood) of female-to-male transmission of HIV in sub-
Saharan Africa [27-29]. However, the first benefit has been questioned, and there is no 
evidence from controlled studies linking the second benefit to NTC in developed 
countries. Accordingly, I contend that neither benefit is great enough to outweigh the 
harm of the surgery or to justify performing it without informed consent from the 
affected person. 
 
Urinary tract infections. Frisch et al. noted that the only relevant benefit of circumcision in 
infancy is a reduction in the risk of contracting a urinary tract infection (UTI) in early 
childhood [16]. According to the Cochrane Review, circumcision cannot be shown to 
meaningfully lessen the risk of contracting a UTI [30]. Moreover, even if NTC were able to 
substantially reduce the incidence of UTIs, this would not be sufficient to render the 
procedure ethically acceptable, because these infections are rare (approximately 1 
percent) in boys, are generally confined to the first half year of life, and are susceptible to 
easy treatment with oral antibiotics [31, 32]. There is also evidence that circumcision can 
sometimes cause UTIs [33, 34]. Performing 100 circumcisions in an attempt to prevent 
one UTI will result in twice that number of complications, including “cases of 
hemorrhage, infection, or, in rare instances, more severe outcomes or even death” [35]. 
 
HIV-AIDS. Current claims that NTC has benefits exceeding the risks largely stem from 
three randomized controlled studies conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. These studies 
found that voluntary male circumcision reduces the risk of female-to-male transmission 
of HIV during unprotected intercourse [27-29], with a relative risk reduction of 38-66 
percent [36]. The risk reduction in absolute terms only comes to about 1.3 percent [37], 
and long-term effects are not well established. Moreover, one of the RCTs found that 
NTC led to a 61.9 percent relative increase in male-to-female HIV transmission and an 
absolute increase in risk of 8.3 percent [38]. These latter findings suggest that any 
  
 
www.amajournalofethics.org 
818 
reduced risk of women infecting men can be counterbalanced by a correspondingly 
increased risk of men infecting women [32, 39]. 
 
Nevertheless, studies performed in impoverished third-world settings cannot justify NTC 
in a first-world setting with populations having dramatically different HIV profiles [40]. In 
Western countries, HIV primarily infects men who have sex with men, a cohort that has 
not been reliably proven to be protected by NTC [41, 42]. In any event, as Frisch et al. 
state, “sexually transmitted HIV infection is not a relevant threat to children” [43]. 
Prominent AIDS researchers no longer consider circumcision a significant part of the 
effort in eradicating HIV [44-46], deeming the best preventive measures to be 
“condoms, treatment for HIV-infected individuals, or clean injection equipment” [47]. 
Since NTC provides no appreciable health benefits to the infant or young child, the 
procedure should be deferred until the affected individual can decide for himself. 
 
Ethics of Nontherapeutic Circumcision 
Catholic moral principles question consent by proxy to NTC, all the more so if the 
procedure is to be performed on a healthy child and can be predicted to effect a 
permanent change in normal anatomy or might negatively impact the functions of a 
nondiseased organ [48]. In what follows, it will be shown that NTC conflicts with each of 
four cardinal ethical principles of medicine. 
 
Respect for patient autonomy. Respect for autonomy is perhaps the paramount ethical 
principle in Western medicine [49]. Circumcision before the age of consent deprives the 
child of a body part that he would otherwise likely appreciate [50] and thus fails to 
preserve his future autonomy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [51] 
states that “Delaying male circumcision until adolescence or adulthood obviates 
concerns about violation of autonomy” [52] and that any medical disadvantages 
associated with such a deferral “would be ethically compensated to some extent by the 
respect for the [bodily] integrity and autonomy of the individual” [53]. 
 
Nonmaleficence (“do no harm”). The principle of nonmaleficence prohibits infliction of 
unnecessary harm on the patient. As discussed above, since NTC imposes on a healthy 
child the risk of significant harms without certain and substantial countervailing benefits, 
it cannot pass the nonmaleficence test. Supporting this principle are two further ethical 
guidelines. First, physicians cannot ethically take orders from parents or guardians; the 
AAP maintains that it is a legal as well as an ethical rule that a physician’s duty is to the 
patient alone [54]. Second, physicians should not normally perform unnecessary surgery 
on children, especially insofar as the procedure involves the removal of healthy, 
functional tissue [55]. Courts have upheld the same conclusion. In Tortorella v Castro, a 
California appeals court found it “self-evident that unnecessary surgery is injurious and 
causes harm to a patient. Even if a surgery is executed flawlessly, if the surgery were 
unnecessary, the surgery in and of itself constitutes harm” [56]. 
 AMA Journal of Ethics, August 2017 
819 
 
Beneficence (“do good”). Douglas Diekema has explained how the ethical principle of 
beneficence applies to the care of children: 
 
To conform to the standard of care, all surgical or other interventions must be in 
the best interests of the patient, and have some reasonable prospect of 
providing a tangible benefit to him. In general, parents cannot subject a child to 
medical procedures that place the child at significant risk of serious harm unless 
there is a corresponding benefit that is likely to outweigh the potential harms. 
Non-therapeutic procedures that involve excessive risk should be avoided [57]. 
 
As noted, the balance of opinion among medical authorities in Northern Europe is that 
the risks and harms of NTC are not outweighed by tangible benefits [16]. Moreover, as 
discussed above, there are no valid medical indications for prophylactic circumcision [58, 
59]. Accordingly, infant circumcision fails to meet the ethical requirement of beneficence. 
 
Justice. To comply with medical ethics principles, physicians must treat their patients 
fairly and impartially. The ethical principle of justice is violated by the availability in 
Western countries of legal protections from unnecessary genital cutting for girls—but 
not for boys [32]. Males have a right to an open future [60] and, accordingly, justice 
mandates protecting their right to natural genitalia along with girls’ corresponding right. 
 
Conclusion 
In response to recent Danish research showing that the overwhelming majority (roughly 
98.3 percent) of genitally intact (not circumcised) boys will not require a circumcision for 
medical reasons before an age of legal majority [61], a former member of the AAP Task 
Force on Circumcision, Andrew L. Freedman, conceded that circumcision is 
fundamentally a religious or cultural practice in search of a “medical” justification [62]. 
 
As argued here, nontherapeutic circumcision of male minors is not medically justifiable 
and violates the cardinal principles of medical ethics, including preserving a child’s future 
autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and justice. Circumcision should be at least 
delayed until the affected person reaches an age of understanding and is able to make 
his own risk-benefit analysis. Notably, the Danish Medical Association issued a policy 
paper in December 2016 that found NTC before the age of informed consent to be 
unethical [63]. Physicians’ legal right to operate on healthy children is also questionable. 
In 2012, a German court held that circumcision constitutes criminal assault by causing 
bodily harm and denying a child his right to physical integrity, although the decision was 
later legislatively reversed [64]. And in 2015, in a case involving female genital 
cutting/mutilation, a British judge found that nontherapeutic circumcision of male 
children is a “significant harm” [65]. As the balance of legal, ethical, and human rights 
discourse moves steadily against NTC, courts in the US and elsewhere might gradually

conclude that NTC is inconsistent with medical professionals’ ethical and legal duties to 
the child. 
 
The vast majority of medical practitioners have the best interests of their patients at 
heart; if they recommend or agree to circumcision, it is usually in the belief that it does 
more good than harm. As more physicians are coming to realize, however, this belief is 
misguided: many physicians to whom I speak these days now say that they would prefer 
not to circumcise and only do it because the parents ask for it. At the same time, it is 
often the case that the only reason parents ask for it is because they believe circumcision 
is medically beneficial, recommended by health authorities, or the normal thing to do. It 
is time for this vicious circle to be broken. Who better to take the initiative than the 
community that introduced NTC in the first place—the American medical profession?
