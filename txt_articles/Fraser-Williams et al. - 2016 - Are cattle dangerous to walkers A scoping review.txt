ABSTRACT
Anecdotal evidence suggests that people coming into
contact with cattle while participating in outdoor
pursuits can sustain severe, even fatal injuries. This has
negative implications for farmers, cattle and the public.
This study outlines findings from a review of published
literature, UK media reports and internet guidelines
currently available to the UK public for walking near
cattle. A total of 54 cattle attacks were reported in the
UK media from 1 January 1993 to 31 May 2013;
approximately one-quarter resulted in fatality and two-
thirds involved dogs. Walking with dogs among cows,
particularly with calves present, was a problematic
context. Twenty pieces of commonly occurring advice
were found within various guidelines. However, there are
no definitive approved guidelines, no published studies
describing the prevalence of cattle attacks on members
of the public and no system in place to document them.
Attacks by cattle are underinvestigated and further work
should assess their public health impact.
INTRODUCTION
Annually, there are 3.6 billion tourist visits to the
UK countryside; 18% of visitors being walkers.1 2
In England in 2011–2012, dog walking was the
second most frequent countryside activity, account-
ing for 51.0% of visits.3 As promotion of physical
activity via dog walking is a public health strategy,
evaluation of potential risks to public health from
these activities is important.4
There are approximately 300 000 UK farms5and
9.7 million cattle.6 Public rights of way cross farm-
land including livestock grazing, so that while
walking people come into contact with livestock,
particularly cattle, and may have limited knowledge
of how to behave around them.
Risk assessments and mitigation measures are
increasingly
implemented
to
manage
risk,
but
intensive attempts to govern human/cattle interac-
tions would have negative implications for farmers,
cattle and the public. Likely risk-management prac-
tices include removal of herds from publically
accessed fields during peak seasons or restricting
public access, and euthanasia of cattle that have
attacked walkers. These could affect animal welfare
via husbandry and farming practices, and finan-
cially impact farmers. Further, they could reduce
public motivation for countryside outdoor activ-
ities. Thus, it is important to fully evaluate the
scope of this public health problem.
The aim of this project was to assess available
information about negative interactions between
the public and cattle, to identify risk factors for
cattle attacks, and highlight the availability and use-
fulness of guidance on walking among livestock.
The study outlines the findings of: (1) a literature
review of published research; (2) a review of media
reports; (3) an internet search of guidelines for
countryside walking.
METHODS
Search-term development
Search terms for sets of searches were developed by
iteratively trialling popular related phrases found in
the published literature, media reports and using
internet searches, until the most commonly occur-
ring
search
terms
were
identified.
Using
this
method, ‘cow’ for example was identified as being
more commonly used than ‘cattle’, and sufficient to
return all findings also related to ‘cattle’. The
searches were conducted by a single author.
Published literature
Relevant published literature in English was identi-
fied
using
searches
of
SCOPUS
and
W
eb
of
Knowledge. Formal literature searches of ‘title’,
‘abstract’, ‘keywords’ and ‘topic’ search fields were
undertaken using the ‘(cow* OR bovine) AND
(attack OR injury)’ search term, to May 2013 inclu-
sive (figure 1).
Media reports
Media reports from the UK newspapers describing
cattle attacks were identified by searching Lexis
Library (1993 to May 2013 inclusive) using the
search phrase ‘(cow* OR bovine) AND (attack OR
injury) AND (walker* OR public)’.
Public guidelines
Current
publically
available
internet
guidelines
describing best practice for walking among cattle
were identified by searching Google, timespan
unrestricted, UK pages only. The prepiloted search
terms included: guidelines for walking through
fields with cows; walking through fields with cows;
cattle in fields crossed by public access; walking a
dog through fields with cows; dog walking in cow
fields.
RESULTS
Published literature
Eight published papers reported outcomes and/or
risk factors for cattle attacks (figure 1). Of these,
six studies detailed injuries caused by cattle/bulls
via hospital admittance.7–12 T
wo studies described
bovine
behaviour
such
as
maternal
defensive
aggression/vigilance as a fear response to presence
of
a
person/dog
or
movement
to
unfamiliar
locations.13 14
Injury or fatality records
Kicking, crushing, head butting and trampling were
the main causes of hospital-recorded injury, with
fractures/contusions
the
most
common
conse-
quences.

 occupations involving direct cattle contact as opposed to public
walkers, for example, dairy and beef farmers, vets and abattoir
workers.7 8 Fractures were the most common injury, kicking the
most common mechanism, and feeding the most common situ-
ation.8 Injuries from bulls were more common than from cows.9
Specific bull-only incidents were also reported.10 11 US data
identified 287 bull cases; 261 were attacks on people, of which
149 were fatal.11 The injuries related to being charged or
trampled, or accidentally stepped on, by Holstein dairy and
Angus beef dominant breeds.11
Maternal behaviour
A study of maternal defensive aggression as a result of calves, a
heritable trait, suggested that humans are perceived as a threat
to
calves,
causing
protective
behaviour
in
cows.13
Extensification
of
pasture-based
systems,
decreased
routine
contact between handlers and non-lactating cows, an increase in
calf contact post partum (to comply with EU ear-tagging regula-
tions) and an increase, by the public, in recreational use of agri-
cultural land were suggested as factors intensifying injury risk,
with authors concluding an increasing trend in cattle maternal
defensiveness and associated risk to handlers and public safety.13
Fear of dogs
A study of vigilance to measure fear in dairy cattle concluded
that dogs were even more threatening than unfamiliar humans,
resembling potential predators, and cattle were exceptionally
vigilant in novel locations.14
Media
One thousand records were identified, 100 of which were rele-
vant. Of these, 11 were duplicates, leaving 89 records (see
online supplementary data).

Inj Prev: first published as 10.1136/injuryprev-2015-041784 on 12 January 2016. Downloaded from 
 From January 1993 to May 2013, 54 separate cattle attacks
were reported involving the public walking in livestock areas
(figure 2): attacks peaked at 13 in 2009, of which nine occurred
in May and June. Thirteen (24.1%) attacks resulted in walker
fatality, with a peak of four in 2009. Reported walker injuries
included fractures to arms, ribs, wrist, scapula, clavicle, legs,
lacerations, punctured lung, bruising, black eyes, joint disloca-
tion, nerve damage and unconsciousness.
Most (72%) media reports definitively stated the presence/
absence of dogs during an attack: 35 (64.8%) involved one dog,
and there was no dog in four (7.4%). Reports also described
five cattle categories: herd/multiple cattle (n=26, 48.2%); single
cow (n=12, 22.2%); cows and calves (n=11, 20.4%); heifer
(n=4, 7.4%); and bull (n=1, 1.9%).
Of the attacks, four were reported in more than five newspa-
pers: one described an attack on David Blunkett, the former
Home Secretary, who stumbled and broke a rib while releasing
his guide-dog’s lead; one described an attack on a veterinarian
who was trampled and killed while protecting her dogs, who
were thought to have sparked the attack; one described an
attack on brothers, one of whom died and the other suffered a
punctured lung while walking dogs; and one described an attack
on a walker who required emergency neurosurgery. She had
strayed from an obstructed public footpath to follow a diversion
while dog walking; she picked up the dog after it startled cattle.
Media reports suggest factors influencing the likelihood or
severity of attack including: the context as well as the behaviour
of the people, dogs and cattle (table 1). Descriptive investigation
of the data also suggests that female members of the public may
be more likely to protect their dogs, while males let them go
(see online supplementary data).
Sensational language is used throughout reports, with phrases
such as ‘Cow attacks: “It looked like they wanted to kill
him;”’15 such language depicts cattle as being dangerous and
highly likely to attack at any point, while the walker is portrayed
as blameless.
Guidelines
T
wenty-four separate web pages specifying countryside guide-
lines were identified, including not hanging onto dogs if threa-
tened by cattle, releasing them; and avoiding getting between
cows and calves (table 2). The content of the guidelines varied
widely, however guidelines on best practice when dog walking
stipulated in ‘The Countryside Code’16 were often reproduced.
The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) also provides advice for
those grazing cattle on public access fields, recognising the main
risk factors: that walkers often have dogs; and when stressed by
the weather, illness, unusual disturbance or when maternal
instincts are aroused, cattle can become aggressive.17

 Following three cattle-related deaths in 2009, the National
Farmers Union provided new signage reminding walkers using
public footpaths to keep dogs on leads, but release if chased or
threatened by cattle.18 In October 2005, the Countryside and
Rights of W
ay Act 2000 (CROW) was implemented across
England19 giving the public freedom to roam without staying
on paths; restrictions include keeping dogs on leads near live-
stock and landowners/tenants excluding or restricting access in
certain circumstances.
DISCUSSION
W
alking with dogs and cows with calves were key features of
this study; both recognised as risk factors in the published litera-
ture, newspaper articles and web pages. Often dogs drew cattle’s
attention, and owners picked up dogs rather than releasing
them.
Further, the enormity of the issue of cattle-related injury is
unknown, although hospital records describe injuries mainly in
animal husbandry and related occupations. This study confirms
that walker injury from cattle is a public health risk worth
future attention. There is no official documentation system, and
it is likely that attacks are under-reported. Between April 1996
and March 2006, the HSE investigated 46 incidents,20 whereas
the media review reported in this study identified 17 attacks,
and at least one cattle attack requiring hospitalisation was not
reported in newspapers nor investigated by HSE (W
estgarth,
personal communication). The lack of public concern about this
risk is surprising considering the political and media concern
over comparable animal-related injuries such as bites from dogs;
however, cattle are not regarded as ‘members of the family’.
In conclusion, numerator information from cattle attacks
gaining media attention are available but likely underestimate
the true extent and no denominator information is available
describing the number of countryside dog walkers; both are
necessary to calculate the incidence of attacks and aid examin-
ation of risk factors. More research is required, in particular
considering changes to countryside access and the promotion of
physical activity for health. One possibility is the creation of a
highly promoted central database, to encourage self-reporting of
cattle attacks. Further, a generic approved guidance document in

What is already known on the subject
▸ Many members of the public walk or participate in other
outdoor pursuits in the UK countryside and they often have
dogs with them.
▸ There are anecdotal and hospital reports of cattle causing
injury or death to walkers.
What this study adds
▸ Injuries from cattle are a significant and under-reported
public health risk.
▸ Walkers with dogs are at particular risk.
▸ Guidelines of how to behave around cattle and avoid injury
vary, in particular concerning control of dogs.

Who declares Napier a safe city
Napier, New Zealand competed against 30 cities to win the 2016 WHO Western Pacific
Regional Office Healthy Cities Recognition for Violence and Injury Prevention (Safe Cities). The
city ‘demonstrated leadership and collaboration in the fields of, for example, crime prevention,
road safety and reducing alcohol-related harm’.
Comment: I have never been convinced the Safe City idea actually reduced injuries. But
there is no doubting their hard work and dedication.
Reduction in longevity following a traumatic brain injury?
A Swedish study tracked the life trajectories of a large number of people who sustained a
traumatic brain injury (TBI) before the age of 25. TBI victims had shorter life spans than their
uninjured siblings and were nearly twice as likely to be hospitalised for a psychiatric illness
before age 30. An editorial cautioned that it is not easy to draw a causal connection given the
time period.
