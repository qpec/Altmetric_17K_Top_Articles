 Serotonin transporter polymorphism (5HTTLPR),
severe childhood abuse and depressive symptom
trajectories in adulthood
Timothy B. Nguyen, Jane M. Gunn, Maria Potiriadis, Ian P. Everall and Chad A. Bousman
Background
Cross-sectional studies suggest that the serotonin
transporter promoter region polymorphism (5-HTT gene-
linked polymorphic region, 5HTTLPR) moderates the
relationship between childhood abuse and major depressive
disorder.
Aims
To examine whether the 5HTTLPR polymorphism moderates
the effect childhood abuse has on 5-year depressive symptom
severity trajectories in adulthood.
Method
At 5-year follow-up, DNA from 333 adult primary care
attendees was obtained and genotyped for the 5HTTLPR
polymorphism. Linear mixed models were used to test for a
genotype × childhood abuse interaction effect on 5-year
depressive symptom severity trajectories.
Results
After covariate adjustment, homozygous s allele carriers with a
history of severe childhood abuse had significantly greater
depressive symptom severity at baseline compared with those
without a history of severe childhood abuse and this effect
persisted throughout the 5-year period of observation.
Conclusions
The 5HTTLPR s/s genotype robustly moderates the effects of
severe childhood abuse on depressive symptom severity
trajectories in adulthood.

Exposure to adverse life events during childhood has consistently
been linked to increased risk of depression in adulthood.1,2
However, early life exposure to adversity alone is likely not
sufficient to elicit depression later in life. In fact, evidence to date
suggests that some individuals are more susceptible to negative
outcomes following exposure to adversity and that this suscept-
ibility in part may reside in an individual’s genome.
Over the past decade, genetic variation in over 35 genes have
been examined for their interaction with adverse life events.3
Among these genes, the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) and its
corresponding length polymorphisms located in the 5′-flanking
promoter
region
(5-HTT
gene-linked
polymorphic
region,
5HTTLPR)4 is arguably the most studied in relation to depression
and exposure to adverse life events, namely severe childhood
abuse. The initial study conducted by Caspi et al5 reported that
young adults with the s allele were more likely to develop
depression after exposure to severe childhood abuse compared
with those with the l allele and proposed that the s allele may be a
moderator (effect modifier) of the relationship between stress and
depression. However, meta-analyses have both supported6 and
rejected this notion7 and researchers have since criticised the
reliance on cross-sectional designs, inadequate adjustment for
potential confounders and clinical utility of the gene × environment
studies conducted to date.8,9
In response to these criticisms, the present study examined the
interaction between the 5HTTLPR polymorphism and history of
severe childhood abuse on depressive symptom trajectories in a
5-year prospective cohort of primary care attendees. Linear mixed
modelling was used to test whether 5HTTLPR genotype moder-
ated the effect of severe childhood abuse on depressive symptom
trajectories. We hypothesised that s/s carriers would be more likely
to experience severe depressive symptom trajectories following
exposure to severe childhood abuse compared with s/l or l/l
carriers.
Method
Participants
Participants were recruited from the Diagnosis, Management and
Outcomes of Depression in Primary Care (diamond) study, an
ongoing prospective cohort that commenced in 2005 with an aim
to document the experiences, health outcomes, treatment and
service use of primary care patients identified as having clinically
relevant depressed mood at screening from 30 rural and
metropolitan general practices randomly recruited in Victoria,
Australia.10 Patients were eligible for the diamond cohort if they
were: (a) aged 18–75 years, (b) able to read English, (c) not
terminally ill, (d) did not reside in a nursing home and (e) scored
16 or higher on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression
Scale.11 Participants were assessed annually using postal surveys as
well as computer-assisted telephone interviews. In 2011 (cohort
year 6), participants enrolled in the cohort were invited to provide
a saliva sample for DNA extraction and genotyping.
All procedures were conducted in accordance with principles
expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki and obtained approval
from the University of Melbourne Human Research Ethics
Committee (Ethics ID 1135247.1).
Measures
The main outcome of interest was depression symptom severity
assessed at baseline and 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-year post-baseline
using the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders Patient
Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The PHQ-9 is a self-administered
questionnaire of depressive symptoms based directly on the nine
BJPsych Open (2015)

104
 signs and symptoms of major depressive disorder as described in
the DSM-IV12 and has been validated to screen and monitor
depression severity in the primary care setting.13 The PHQ-9 asks
respondents to rate their symptoms over the past 2 weeks and
is scored on a scale of 0 (‘not at all’) to 3 (‘nearly every day’) for
each item with a range of 0–27.14 Scores of 5, 10, 15 and 20 on the
PHQ-9 represent cut-points for mild, moderate, moderately severe
and severe depression respectively.14
The Child Maltreatment History Self-Report (CMHSR)15 was
used to measure history of severe childhood abuse. The CMHSR
includes questions relating to sexual and physical abuse by an
adult before 16 years of age. The distinction of severe physical abuse
was originally based on expert consensus that responses in this
severe category were more likely to cause injury requiring medical
treatment and has been shown to have replicable psychometric
properties.16 The distinction of severe sexual abuse was based on
items from a national Canadian survey of unwanted touching in
sexual areas and attempted or achieved unwanted intercourse.17
At baseline, assessments were also made of age, gender highest
level of completed education, smoking status, family history of
depression, present DSM-IV diagnosis of depression, antidepres-
sant use, anxiolytic use, herbal/alternative medication use, health
status,18 quality of life,19 alcohol abuse/dependence20 and sig-
nificant negative life events in the past year.21
Polymorphism selection, DNA extraction and
genotyping
The 5HTTLPR and its A-to-G internal single nucleotide poly-
morphism (rs25531) were selected for genotyping. Individuals
were categorised as s/s if they were s/s, s/lG or lG/lG. Those who
had s/lA or lG/lA were categorised as s/l and individuals with lAlA
were categorised as l/l. To detect the presence of population
stratification, 60 unlinked ancestry informative markers (AIMs;
Table DS1) representing the three HapMap phase III populations
(Northern/Western European, Han Chinese and Yoruba in
Nigeria) were also genotyped.22
DNA was recovered from stabilised saliva samples using the
manual prep IT system according to manufacturer’s instructions
(Oragene DNA (OG-500); DNA Genotek, Ontario, Canada).
DNA precipitates were allowed to resuspend for a minimum of
48 h before quantification by fluorimetry (QuantiFluor™ dsDNA
System; Promega Corporation, Madison, Wisconsin, USA) in
conjunction with a Gemini™ Spectramax XPS fluorescence
microplate reader (Molecular Devices, LLC, Sunnyvale, California,
USA). DNA stocks were adjusted to a working concentration of
between 10 and 50 ng/μL for subsequent genotyping.
The SLC6A4 locus was amplified for both the 5HTTLPR and
rs25531 polymorphisms. The promoter region was amplified
using the primers SERT1 and SERT2.23 The 5HTTLPR poly-
morphism was analysed as described in Wendland et al24 with
modifications. Reactions were performed in a total volume of
24 μL comprising ‘KapaTaq A’ polymerase (0.6 units), ‘High-Yield’
Reaction Buffer A (2.4 μL); both Kapa Biosystems, Boston,
Massachusetts, USA), 0.48 μL dNTP mix (2.5 mM; Bioline
Australia, Alexandria, New South Wales, Australia), 20–50 ng
template DNA, and supplementary Mg2+ (1.0 mM final; MgSO4,
50 mM; Bioline Australia) and 7-deaza-dGTP (0.2 mM final;
New England Biolabs, Ipswich, Massachusetts). After initial
denaturation (95°C, 7 min), cycling parameters were 94°C (60 s),
61°C (60 s), 72°C (60 s) (20 cycles) followed by a further 20 cycles
of 94°C (60 s), 63°C (60 s), 72°C (60 s), and a final extension period
of 72°C for 30 min. All polymerase chain reactions were conducted
using Veriti 96-well thermal cyclers (Life Technologies Australia
Scoresby, Victoria, Australia). Genotypes were determined by
capillary electrophoresis using an AB3730 Genetic Analyser fitted
with a 36 cm array, with sizing determined against a Genescan
LIZ500 molecular weight marker. Analysis was performed in
Genemapper V3.7 software (Life Technologies Australia, Scoresby,
Victoria, Australia).
Statistical analysis
Chi-squared analysis was used to detect departures from Hardy–
Weinberg equilibrium of 5HTTLPR. To estimate the presence of
population stratification, the 60 AIMs were used to assign each
participant to the HapMap ancestral group for which they carried
the greatest proportion of that population’s AIMs.
Linear mixed models were used to determine trajectory
differences in PHQ-9 depressive symptom severity over the
5-year follow-up period by 5HTTLPR and history of severe child
abuse. Before modelling, genotype variables and covariates were
centred.25 Potential covariates were assessed for their association
with abuse history and genotype using chi-squared, Fisher’s exact
or analysis of variance tests, depending on the variable structure.
Covariates with P-values ≤0.05 were retained for adjusted
analyses (Table 1). The unadjusted model included fixed effects
of time, genotype, child abuse, and a time × genotype, time × child
abuse, genotype × child abuse, and time × genotype × child abuse
interaction terms as well as random effects of individual, primary
care site, intercept (baseline PHQ) and time. Adjusted models
included relevant covariates as well as covariate × time, covariate ×
genotype, and covariate × child abuse interaction terms as recently
recommended.26 Covariance models used for the random and
repeated effects were unstructured and first-order autoregressive,
respectively. To improve model fit, a stepwise elimination strategy
was employed by comparing −2 log likelihood (−2LL) informa-
tion criteria using unrestricted maximum likelihood estimations.
The covariate term with the lowest F-test score was removed,
one at a time, and discarded if the difference in the −2LL
between the simpler model and more complex model was less
than 3.86 (i.e. chi-squared value with 1 degree of freedom at
P=0.05). The final reduced adjusted model was tested with
restricted maximum likelihood estimation. Modelling was per-
formed using the SPSS software (SPSS, version 22.0, IBM,
Chicago, Illinois, USA).27
Results
A total of 498 individuals were enrolled in the diamond study at
the time of DNA collection in cohort year 6 and 344 (69%)
participants returned a DNA sample. Six individuals who were
missing genotype data and five individuals who were missing
childhood abuse data were excluded, resulting in a total of 333
individuals available for analysis (Table 1). No differences in
demographic or clinical characteristics were detected by genotype.
However, sedative use, self-rated health, non-alcohol-related
substance abuse and the abbreviated World Health Organization
Quality of Life and Functioning instrument of social relationships
(WHOQOL-BREF social) differed by history of severe childhood
abuse (Table 1) and as such were included in the adjusted models.

 5-year period of observation. However, individuals with the l/s or
l/l genotype had similar depressive symptom trajectories regard-
less of severe child abuse history (s/l: mean difference=0.8,
95% CI −1.1–1.3, pcovariate adjusted=0.892; l/l: mean difference=0.3,
95% CI −1.9–2.5, pcovariate adjusted=0.773). Furthermore, among
individuals without a history of severe child abuse, s/s genotype
carriers appeared to have more favourable depressive symptom
trajectories compared with s/l and l/l genotype carriers, albeit not
statistically significant (F=2.72, pcovariate adjusted=0.068, Fig. DS1).
Parameter estimates for all terms included in the unadjusted
and adjusted models are provided in Tables DS2 and DS3
respectively.
Discussion
In accordance with our hypothesis and previous cross-sectional
studies,6 we observed greater depressive symptom severity among
individuals with the s/s genotype who reported a history of severe
child abuse compared with those without a history. We also provide
novel evidence which suggests that the s/s genotype confers a
persistent moderating effect on depressive symptom severity
without alteration to the rate of change over time. There was no
significant difference in depressive symptoms between those with
or without a history of child abuse in the s/l or l/l genotype groups.
These findings support the notion that long-lasting consequences
of adverse childhood experiences may be dependent on an
individual’s genomic context.28 More specifically, these findings
suggest that the s/s genotype may be associated with susceptibility
to more severe depressive symptom trajectories in adulthood
following exposure to severe abuse in childhood.
Among the s/s group, those with a history of severe, child
abuse had a mean PHQ-9 score greater than 10 (i.e. moderate
depression) at each time point over the 5-year period, whereas
those without a history of child abuse consistently scored under 10
(i.e. mild depression), a differential effect not observed among s/l
and l/l genotype carriers. However, among individuals without a
history of severe child abuse, we detected a trend in which s/s
genotype carriers had more favourable depressive symptom
trajectories compared with s/l and l/l genotype carriers. This
pattern of results suggests that the 5HTTLPR polymorphism may
be a marker of ‘phenotypic plasticity’ rather than ‘vulnerability’
in that s/s carriers appear to be the most susceptible to the
negative effects of severe child abuse (i.e. increased depressive
symptom severity) but also marginally more likely to benefit from
the absence of a severe child abuse experience, albeit only a trend
difference (P=0.068) was seen between s/s carriers and their l/l or
l/s carrying counterparts in the absences of severe child abuse.
Nonetheless, this so-called ‘differential susceptibility’29 has been
observed previously. Most notably, in the landmark paper by
Caspi et al5 in that s/s genotype carriers with stressful life events
reported the most depressive symptoms but conversely those
without such events reported the fewest depressive symptoms.
Similar results for the s/s genotype have been observed more
recently. Eley et al30 showed the s/s genotype conferred more
susceptibility to depression among female adolescents in high-
stress environments but s/s genotype carriers in low-stress
environments were less likely to be depressed. Furthermore,
Wilhelm et al31 showed that the probability of lifetime major
depression was highest among s/s carriers with more than one
adverse life event in the past 5 years but lowest for s/s carriers with
no such events.
If the 5HTTLPR polymorphism is a marker of ‘phenotypic
plasticity’, it may have clinical utility in guiding psychosocial
intervention in the future. In fact, recent work showed that
children with anxiety with the s/s genotype were more likely to

5HTTLPR, child abuse and depressive symptoms
 respond to cognitive–behavioural therapy compared with s/l and l/l
genotypes,32 albeit this was not observed in a randomised control
trial of cognitive-behavioural therapy among adults with recurrent
depression.33 Furthermore, the antidepressant pharmacogenomics
literature suggests that, among White but not Asian people, the l/l
rather than the s/s genotype infers ‘phenotypic plasticity’ in that
s allele carriers are less likely to respond to selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors compared with individuals with the l/l geno-
type.34 Likewise, there is evidence, primarily in adolescent studies,
suggesting the s/s genotype effect is stronger among females and in
some cases in the opposite direction in males.35 In fact, in our fully
adjusted model both gender and gender × genotype showed larger
effects on depressive symptom severity than we detected for child
abuse × genotype. Thus, further clinical trials, with particular
attention to ancestry and gender, are required to determine the
utility of 5HTTLPR genotype-guided psychosocial intervention in
clinical practice.
The mechanism(s) by which the 5HTTLPR polymorphism
confers differential susceptibility to the negative effects of child
abuse is not clear. However, previous work has shown a link
between child abuse and methylation in a CpG residue immedi-
ately upstream of the 5HTTLPR36 and the s allele appears to be
more susceptible to methylation.37 Supporting this observation, a
more recent study showed a decrease in SLC6A4 transcription in
peripheral blood cells among s allele carriers who reported a
history of early trauma compared with s allele carriers without
early trauma and l allele carriers with or without early trauma.38
Thus, the differential susceptibility conferred by the s/s genotype
that we and others have observed may in part be explained by
DNA methylation mediated SLC6A4 transcription and possibly
translation, although the data linking SLC6A4 methylation to its
protein expression is limited. Further clinical as well as human
post-mortem brain studies with accompanying ante-mortem data
on child abuse/adverse life events are needed before firm
conclusions on the mechanisms can be made.
The current study has several notable strengths absent in
previous studies. We included comprehensive covariate adjust-
ment, modelled both fixed and random effects, and used a
longitudinal design. However, six key caveats should be acknowl-
edged. First, depressive symptom severity was the primary
outcome measure and as such results cannot be extrapolated to
the categorical diagnosis of major depressive disorder. However,
the use of quantitative traits and a dimensional perspective affords
greater statistical power and the PHQ-9 has previously been
validated as a replicable measure of symptom severity that
correlates
with
decreasing
physical
and
social
functioning,
increased disability days, and increased healthcare utilisation and
thus is likely to be more meaningful compared with a dichotomous
clinical diagnostic classification.14 Second, although all partici-
pants were of Northern/Western European ancestry, a strength
in genetic association studies, we are not able to generalise these
results to other ancestry groups, particularly given that frequencies
of the s and l alleles are known to vary by ancestry.39 Third,
detailed measures of depression treatment history were not
available and adjustment of possible effects of antidepressant or
psychotherapy treatment beyond the scope of self-reported use at
baseline was not possible. Although we did not observe a
difference in baseline antidepressant use by genotype, future
follow-up studies should include detailed measurements of anti-
depressant use to evaluate whether the effect reported here is
confounded by pharmacotherapy. Fourth, our linear mixed model
approach required a large number of covariates and interactions
to be examined in order to properly control for potential
confounds.26 As a result, statistical power was likely suboptimal
and our post hoc stratified analyses by genotype may have
overestimated the true effects. Fifth, a priori we selected an
additive genetic model but post hoc evaluation of our results
suggests a recessive model (s/s v. l carriers) may also fit our data.
Although previous studies in the literature have almost exclusively
assumed an additive model, future studies may benefit from
examination of a recessive model. Last, this study did not examine
all types of potential childhood adversity and relied on self-report.
Childhood emotional abuse or neglect have also been associated with
depressive symptoms in the primary care setting40 but were not
queried and may have important effects not accounted for in this
study. Furthermore, some have criticised the use of self-reported
childhood abuse due to a number of biases (e.g. underreporting).41,42
However, it is likely that these biases would obscure the moderation
effect observed, resulting in more conservative parameter estimates.
In summary, our results provide evidence that the 5HTTLPR
s/s genotype moderates the effects of severe childhood abuse on
depressive symptom severity among adult primary care attendees.
This effect was detected at baseline, persisted over the 5-year
observation period and withstood robust adjustment of key
confounders. If replicated, the 5HTTLPR polymorphism may
serve as one of many candidate markers that could aid in
identifying
susceptibility
to
persistent
depressive
symptoms
among individuals with a history of severe childhood abuse.
