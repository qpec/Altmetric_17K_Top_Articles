 Harms of Breast Cancer Screening: Systematic Review to Update the
2009 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation
Heidi D. Nelson, MD, MPH; Miranda Pappas, MA; Amy Cantor, MD, MPH; Jessica Griffin, MS; Monica Daeges, BA;
and Linda Humphrey, MD, MPH
Background: In 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force
recommended biennial mammography screening for women
aged 50 to 74 years and selective screening for those aged 40 to
49 years.
Purpose: To review studies of screening in average-risk women
with mammography, magnetic resonance imaging, or ultra-
sonography that reported on false-positive results, overdiagno-
sis, anxiety, pain, and radiation exposure.
Data Sources: MEDLINE and Cochrane databases through De-
cember 2014.
Study Selection: English-language systematic reviews, ran-
domized trials, and observational studies of screening.
Data Extraction: Investigators extracted and confirmed data
from studies and dual-rated study quality. Discrepancies were
resolved through consensus.
Data Synthesis: Based on 2 studies of U.S. data, 10-year cumu-
lative rates of false-positive mammography results and biopsies
were higher with annual than biennial screening (61% vs. 42%
and 7% vs. 5%, respectively) and for women aged 40 to 49 years,
those with dense breasts, and those using combination hor-
mone therapy. Twenty-nine studies using different methods re-
ported overdiagnosis rates of 0% to 54%; rates from randomized
trials were 11% to 22%. Women with false-positive results re-
ported more anxiety, distress, and breast cancer–specific worry,
although results varied across 80 observational studies. Thirty-
nine observational studies indicated that some women reported
pain during mammography (1% to 77%); of these, 11% to 46%
declined future screening. Models estimated 2 to 11 screening-
related deaths from radiation-induced cancer per 100 000
women using digital mammography, depending on age and
screening
interval.
Five
observational
studies
of
tomo-
synthesis and mammography indicated increased biopsies but
reduced recalls compared with mammography alone.
Limitations: Studies of overdiagnosis were highly heteroge-
neous, and estimates varied depending on the analytic ap-
proach. Studies of anxiety and pain used different outcome mea-
sures. Radiation exposure was based on models.
Conclusion: False-positive results are common and are higher
for annual screening, younger women, and women with dense
breasts. Although overdiagnosis, anxiety, pain, and radiation ex-
posure may cause harm, their effects on individual women are
difficult to estimate and vary widely.

I
n 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force
(USPSTF)
recommended
biennial
mammography
screening for women aged 50 to 74 years (1) on the
basis of evidence of benefits and harms (2, 3). The
USPSTF concluded that screening decisions for women
aged 40 to 49 years should be based on individual con-
siderations and that evidence was insufficient to assess
benefits and harms for those aged 75 years or older (1).
Although there is general consensus that mam-
mography screening is beneficial for many women,
benefits must be weighed against potential harms to
determine the net effect of screening on individual
women. Determining the balance between benefits
and harms is complicated by several important consid-
erations that are unresolved, including defining and
quantifying potential harms; the optimal ages at which
to begin and end routine screening; the optimal
screening intervals; appropriate use of various imaging
modalities, including supplemental technologies; val-
ues and preferences of women in regards to screening;
and how all of these considerations vary depending on
a woman's risk for breast cancer.
This systematic review updates evidence for the
USPSTF on the harms of breast cancer screening, in-
cluding false-positive mammography results, overdiag-
nosis, anxiety, pain during procedures, and radiation
exposure, and how these adverse effects vary by age,
risk factor, screening interval, and screening modality.
Systematic reviews of the effectiveness of screening (4),
performance characteristics of screening methods (5),
and the accuracy of breast density determination and
use of supplemental screening technologies (6) are
provided in additional reports.
METHODS
Scope, Key Questions, and Analytic Framework
The USPSTF determined the scope and key ques-
tions for this review by using established methods (7,
8). A standard protocol was developed and publicly
posted on the USPSTF Web site. A technical report fur-
ther describes the methods and includes search strate-
gies and additional information (4).
Investigators created an analytic framework outlin-
ing the key questions, patient populations, interven-
tions, and outcomes reviewed (Appendix Figure 1,
available at www.annals.org). Key questions include the

 harms of routine breast cancer screening and how they
differ by age, risk factor, screening interval, and screen-
ing modality (mammography [film, digital, or tomosyn-
thesis],
magnetic
resonance
imaging
[MRI],
and
ultrasonography). Harms include false-positive and
false-negative mammography results, overdiagnosis,
anxiety and other psychological responses, pain during
procedures, and radiation exposure. Overdiagnosis re-
fers to women receiving a diagnosis of ductal carci-
noma in situ (DCIS) or invasive breast cancer when they
have abnormal lesions that are unlikely to become clin-
ically evident during their lifetime in the absence of
screening. Overdiagnosed women may be harmed by
unnecessary procedures and treatments as well as by
the burden of receiving a cancer diagnosis.
The target population for the USPSTF recommen-
dation includes women aged 40 years or older and ex-
cludes women with known physical signs or symptoms
of breast abnormalities and those at high risk for breast
cancer whose surveillance and management are be-
yond the scope of the USPSTF recommendations for
preventive services (preexisting breast cancer or high-
risk breast lesions, hereditary genetic syndromes asso-
ciated with breast cancer, and previous large doses of
chest radiation before age 30 years). Risk factors con-
sidered in this review are common among women who
are not at high risk for breast cancer (9) (described in
Appendix Figure 1).
Data Sources and Searches
A research librarian conducted electronic searches
of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials,
the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and
Ovid MEDLINE through December 2014 for relevant
studies and systematic reviews. Searches were supple-
mented
by
references
identified
from
additional
sources, including reference lists and experts. Studies
of harms included in the previous systematic review for
the USPSTF (2, 3) were also included.
Study Selection
Two investigators independently evaluated each
study to determine eligibility based on prespecified in-
clusion criteria. Discrepancies were resolved through
consensus.
We included recently published systematic re-
views; randomized, controlled trials (RCTs); and obser-
vational studies of prespecified harms. When available,
studies providing outcomes specific to age, risk factors,
screening intervals, and screening modalities were pre-
ferred over studies providing general outcomes. Stud-
ies that were most clinically relevant to practice in the
United States were selected; relevance was determined
by practice setting, population, date of publication, and
use of technologies and therapies in current practice.
Studies meeting criteria for high quality and with de-
signs ranked higher in the study design–based hierar-
chy of evidence were emphasized because they are
less susceptible to bias (for example, RCTs were chosen
over observational studies).
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
Details of the study design, patient population, set-
ting, screening method, interventions, analysis, follow-
up, and results were abstracted by one investigator and
confirmed by another. Two investigators independently
applied criteria developed by the USPSTF (7, 8) to rate
the quality of each RCT, cohort study, case–control
study, and systematic review as good, fair, or poor; cri-
teria to rate studies with other designs included in this
review are not available. Discrepancies were resolved
through consensus.
Data Synthesis
Studies meeting inclusion criteria were qualitatively
synthesized. Most studies in this review had designs for
which quality rating criteria are not available, which lim-
ited data synthesis. When possible, we assessed the
aggregate internal validity (quality) of the body of evi-
dence for each key question (good, fair, or poor) by
using methods developed by the USPSTF based on the
number, quality, and size of studies; consistency of re-
sults between studies; and directness of evidence (7, 8).
Role of the Funding Source
This research was funded by the Agency for Health-
care Research and Quality (AHRQ) under a contract to
support the work of the USPSTF. The investigators
worked with USPSTF members and AHRQ staff to de-
velop and refine the scope, analytic frameworks, and
key questions; resolve issues during the project; and
finalize the report. The AHRQ had no role in study se-
lection, quality assessment, synthesis, or development
of conclusions. The AHRQ provided project oversight;
reviewed the draft report; and distributed the draft for
peer review, including to representatives of profes-
sional societies and federal agencies. The AHRQ per-
formed a final review of the manuscript to ensure that
the analysis met methodological standards. The inves-
tigators are solely responsible for the content and the
decision to submit the manuscript for publication.
RESULTS
Of the 12 004 abstracts identified by searches and
other sources, 59 studies met inclusion criteria for key
questions in this report, including 10 systematic reviews
of 134 studies and 49 additional studies (Appendix Fig-
ure 2, available at www.annals.org).
False-Positive Mammography Results
Two new observational studies estimated the cu-
mulative probability of false-positive results after 10
years of screening with film and digital mammography,
based on data from the Breast Cancer Surveillance
Consortium, a large population-based database in the
United States (Appendix Table 1, available at www
.annals.org) (10, 11). When screening began at age 40
years, the cumulative probability of receiving at least 1
false-positive mammography result after 10 years was
61% (95% CI, 59% to 63%) with annual screening and
42% (CI, 41% to 43%) with biennial screening (10). Es-
timates were similar when screening began at age 50

 years. The cumulative probability of receiving a biopsy
recommendation due to a false-positive mammogra-
phy result after 10 years of screening was 7% (CI, 6% to
8%) with annual screening versus 5% (CI, 4% to 5%)
with
biennial
screening
for
women
who
initiated
screening at age 40 years and 9% (CI, 7% to 12%) with
annual screening versus 6% (CI, 6% to 7%) with biennial
screening for those who began at age 50 years.
In a separate analysis, rates of false-positive mam-
mography results were highest among women receiv-
ing annual mammography who had extremely dense
breasts and either were aged 40 to 49 years (65.5%) or
used combination hormone therapy (65.8%) (11). The
highest rates of biopsy due to false-positive mammog-
raphy results were related to similar characteristics and
ranged from 12% to 14%. Rates of false-positive mam-
mography results were lower among women aged 50
to 74 years who were receiving biennial or triennial
mammography and had breasts with scattered fi-
broglandular densities (39.7% and 21.9%, respectively)
or almost entirely fat breast density (17.4% and 12.1%,
respectively), regardless of estrogen use.
Overdiagnosis
A meta-analysis of 3 RCTs (13, 14), a systematic re-
view of 13 observational studies (15), and 18 new indi-
vidual studies (16–33) of overdiagnosis were identified
for this update (4) (Appendix Table 2, available at www
.annals.org). Estimates were primarily based on screen-
ing trials, screening programs and registries, or mod-
eled data. Studies differed by patient populations;
screening and follow-up times; screening policies, up-
take, and intensity; and underlying cancer incidence
trends. In addition, at least 7 different measures of
overdiagnosis were reported (19). Estimates differed in
their numerators and denominators, whether they in-
cluded both invasive cancer and DCIS, their assump-
tions about lead time and progression of invasive can-
cer and DCIS, and whether they reported relative or
absolute changes.
Various methods were used to estimate overdiag-
nosis. The most common methods determined the
difference in cancer incidence in the presence and
absence of screening (observed excess incidence ap-
proach) or made inferences about the lead time or nat-
ural history of breast cancer and estimated the corre-
sponding
frequency
of
overdiagnosis
(lead-time
approach) (35). How differences in study characteris-
tics, measures, and methods affect estimates of overdi-
agnosis has been well-described (13, 14, 19, 35–37),
yet there is no consensus about the appropriate ap-
proach (14) and there are no quality rating criteria to
evaluate studies.

 Estimates From RCTs
Data from 3 RCTs that did not screen control par-
ticipants at the end of the trials were considered to be
the least biased estimates of overdiagnosis in a com-
prehensive review (13, 14). The Malmo
¨ I trial and the
Canadian National Breast Screening Study (CNBSS-1
and CNBSS-2) provided estimates from randomized
comparison groups with follow-up that extended suffi-
ciently beyond the screening period to differentiate
earlier diagnosis from overdiagnosis (13). However,
their approaches differed: The Malmo
¨ I trial included all
breast cancer cases, and the Canadian trials included
only those detected by screening.
Results of the Malmo
¨ I trial (34) and the 2 Canadian
trials (38, 39) were used to compare the excess inci-
dence of breast cancer (both invasive cancer and DCIS)
in the screening population with the incidence in the
absence of screening. Overdiagnosis was estimated at
10.7% (CI, 9.3% to 12.2%) (13, 14) when only cases
identified during the screening period were included
and 19.0% (CI, 15.2% to 22.7%) when cases identified
throughout screening and follow-up were included. Es-
timates for women aged 40 to 49 years in CNBSS-1
(12.4% for shorter accrual and 22.7% for longer accrual)
were higher than for those aged 50 to 59 years in
CNBSS-2 (9.7% and 16.0%, respectively) and those
aged 55 to 69 years in the Malmo
¨ I trial (10.5% and
18.7%, respectively). Recently published long-term
follow-up of the 2 Canadian trials (15 years after enroll-
ment) indicated a 22% overdiagnosis rate for invasive
cancer for the combined age groups (31).
Estimates From Observational Studies
Unadjusted estimates from 13 observational stud-
ies included in a systematic review indicated overdiag-
nosis rates ranging from 0% to 54%, and 6 studies that
adjusted for breast cancer risk and lead time indicated
rates ranging from 1% to 10% (15). Estimates from
other studies fall within this overall broad range.
Anxiety, Distress, and Other Psychological
Responses
Four systematic reviews of 70 unique studies (40–
43) (Table 1) and 10 additional observational studies
(44–53) (Table 2) published after the systematic reviews
described adverse psychological effects of screening.
Although several studies met criteria for fair or good
quality, most were limited by enrollment of small num-
bers of narrowly selected participants, use of various
self-reported measures, differential attrition or re-
sponse rates, and low clinical applicability. No studies
provided results by age, risk factor, screening interval,
or screening modality.
Results of systematic reviews indicated that women
who received clear communication of their negative
mammography results had minimal anxiety, whereas

 those recalled for further testing had more anxiety,
breast cancer–specific worry, and distress (40, 42, 54–
57). Some women had persistent anxiety despite even-
tual
negative
results
(56,
58–61),
whereas
some
showed only transient anxiety (54, 62–68). Among stud-
ies that evaluated reattendance rates, 2 studies re-
ported that women with false-positive results were less
likely to return for their next screening mammography
(56, 69) and 2 studies reported no differences (70, 71).
One study reported an increase in reattendance when
women were given letters tailored to their last screen-
ing result (risk ratio, 1.10 [CI, 1.00 to 1.21]) (72).
Five new observational studies compared psycho-
logical outcomes in women receiving false-positive re-
sults versus those receiving normal results (44, 46–48,
50) and reported findings similar to those of the re-
views. Women with false-positive results had more
breast cancer–specific worry (49% vs. 10%; P < 0.0001),
more worries that affected mood or daily activities (31%
vs. 2%; P < 0.0001) (48), and lower mental functioning
(mean mental functioning score on the Short Form-36

of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at 6
months, 3.2 vs. 2.4; P = 0.045); however, scores were
below clinical thresholds for depression (50). An analy-
sis of racial subgroups in a large study indicated in-
creased depression scores among nonwhite women
with false-positive results (odds ratio, 3.23 [CI, 1.32 to
7.91]) (44). Three studies found lower reattendance
rates for women with false-positive results (51, 52) or
biopsies (51, 53), but reattendance sometimes varied
by specific circumstances, such as age or type of biopsy
(51).
Pain During Procedures
Two systematic reviews included 39 unique studies
of pain associated with screening procedures (73, 74),
and a separate systematic review included 7 trials of
interventions to reduce pain (75) (Appendix Table 3,
available at www.annals.org). Results indicated that
many women had pain (range, 1% to 77%) but few con-
sidered it a deterrent to future screening (73). In these
studies, pain was associated with stage of the men-
strual cycle, anxiety, and the anticipation of pain.
In a review of studies of pain or discomfort after
screening mammography and their effect on screening
reattendance (74), actual nonreattendance due to con-
cerns about pain ranged from 11% to 46% (5 studies)
and intended future nonreattendance ranged from 3%
to 18% (2 studies). Fifteen studies that did not directly
ask about reasons for nonreattendance found no differ-
ences in actual reattendance between women who had
pain and those who did not (risk ratio, 1.38 [CI, 0.94 to
2.02]) (5 studies) (74). However, nonreattenders had
significantly higher pain scores than reattenders in 2 of
3 studies (76–78). Two studies reported lower intent to

 reattend among women with pain, whereas 3 others
reported no differences in intended reattendance and
pain (79–83).
A systematic review of trials of interventions to re-
duce pain associated with mammography screening
(75) found that providing verbal or written information
to women reduced discomfort in 2 studies (84, 85) but
not in a third (86). Studies of different breast compres-
sion strategies (87, 88) or premedication with acetamin-
ophen (89) indicated no differences in discomfort,
whereas use of a breast cushion reduced pain (90).
Radiation Exposure
No studies directly measured the association be-
tween radiation exposure from mammography screen-
ing and the incidence of breast cancer and death.
Two-view digital mammography and screen-film mam-
mography involve average mean glandular radiation
doses of 3.7 and 4.7 mGy, respectively, and are consid-
ered to provide low-dose, low-energy radiation expo-
sure.
Two modeling studies provided estimates of radia-
tion exposure, breast cancer incidence, and death (91,
92) (Appendix Table 4, available at www.annals.org). A
model predicting the number of breast cancer cases
attributable to the radiation dose of a single typical dig-
ital mammogram estimated that the number of deaths
due to radiation-induced cancer ranged from 2 per
100 000 in women aged 50 to 59 years screened bien-
nially to 11 per 100 000 in those aged 40 to 59 years
screened annually (92).
Differences Between Screening Modalities
Six observational studies compared false-positive
recall rates with screening using mammography and
tomosynthesis (93–97) or clinical breast examination
(98) versus mammography alone (Appendix Table 5,
available at www.annals.org). No studies evaluated MRI
screening in women who were not at high risk for
breast cancer.
Four of 5 studies showed statistically significantly
lower rates of recall for tomosynthesis and mammogra-
phy than for mammography alone (93–97). Although
recalls were reduced by 16 per 1000 women (CI, �18
to �14 recalls; P < 0.001) in one U.S. study, biopsies
increased by 1.3 per 1000 women (CI, 0.4 to 2.1 biop-
sies; P = 0.004) (93). A smaller U.S. study showed re-
duced recall rates with tomosynthesis and mammogra-
phy versus mammography alone after controlling for
age, breast density, and breast cancer risk (adjusted
odds ratio, 0.62 [CI, 0.55 to 0.70]; P < 0.0001) (97),
whereas another study indicated no reductions (94).
Two European studies also reported lower rates of re-
call for women screened with tomosynthesis and mam-
mography (1% vs. 2% [P < 0.0001] [95] and 53 vs. 61
per 1000 women [P = 0.001] [96]).
Women
receiving
mammography
and
clinical
breast examination had more recalls than those receiv-
ing mammography alone in a study from Canada (8.7%
vs. 6.5%; 55 additional recalls per 10 000 women) (98).
DISCUSSION
A summary of the evidence is provided in Table 3.
Two large observational studies of women screened in
the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium provided
good-quality evidence about cumulative rates of false-
positive mammography results and biopsies over 10
years. In these studies, rates were higher with annual
than biennial screening (mammography, 61% vs. 42%;
biopsy, 7% vs. 5%) and for women with heteroge-
neously or extremely dense breasts, those aged 40 to
49 years, and those using combination hormone ther-
apy. These results are consistent with those of an earlier
study indicating cumulative 10-year rates of false-
positive mammography results of 49% overall and 56%
for women aged 40 to 49 years, with an overall biopsy
rate of 19% (12). The results of these highly clinically
applicable studies can be used to inform women of the
likelihood of false-positive results and additional proce-
dures with mammography screening in the United
States, particularly for women with characteristics asso-
ciated with the highest rates of false-positive results.
Despite much research, the evidence for determin-
ing overdiagnosis is poor. There is no consensus defi-
nition of overdiagnosis, and there are no criteria on
which to base critical appraisal of studies. Studies are
highly heterogeneous, and estimates vary depending
on the analytic approach. Possibly the least biased es-
timates were derived from 3 RCTs that indicated rates
of 11% to 22%. Unadjusted estimates from 13 observa-
tional studies ranged from 0% to 54%, and 6 studies
that adjusted for breast cancer risk and lead time found
rates ranging from 1% to 10%. Until methodological
standards for estimating overdiagnosis are more clearly
defined, the correct estimate is uncertain.
Although overdiagnosis is an important outcome
of screening, it is difficult to evaluate in individual
women because it is based on knowing whether a spe-
cific lesion will progress and what its effect will be on a
woman's health. Women who are overdiagnosed can
be harmed by unnecessary procedures and treatments
and by the burden of receiving a cancer diagnosis. The
introduction of technology capable of detecting even
smaller suspicious lesions may also lead to increased
overdiagnosis. Understanding the concept of overdiag-
nosis is important to appropriately inform women
about the benefits and harms of screening despite cur-
rent limitations in determining its effect on individual
women.
The effect of screening on anxiety and pain is sup-
ported by fair-level evidence that includes a large num-
ber of predominantly descriptive observational studies.
In general, women with false-positive results have more
anxiety and distress than those with normal results.
Anxiety lessens over time for most women but persists
for others, and some women with false-positive results
do not attend subsequent screenings. Although many
women have pain during mammography, the propor-
tion of those who do not attend subsequent screenings
varies. Studies indicate that the experiences of false-
positive results and pain during mammography differ

 widely among women but are important for many of
them. Additional efforts to reduce false-positive results
and improve how they are communicated and to rec-
ognize and reduce pain during procedures could im-
prove the balance of benefits and harms of screening
for many women.
The harms of radiation exposure from mammogra-
phy screening are based on only 2 modeling studies.
The number of deaths due to radiation-induced cancer
from screening with digital mammography was esti-
mated to be 2 to 11 per 100 000 women, depending
on age and screening intervals. As imaging technolo-
gies change, this estimate could improve or worsen de-
pending on the uptake of supplemental imaging with
tomosynthesis as well as additional imaging for false-
positive results. Reducing radiation exposure through
more effective imaging is an important area of future
research.
Five observational studies described false-positive
results with the use of tomosynthesis. This evidence is
limited by the lack of randomized trials, uncertainty
about the comparability of comparison groups, and dif-
ferences in outcome measures. A U.S. study comparing
tomosynthesis and mammography versus mammogra-
phy alone reported a significant reduction of 16 recalls
but an increase of 1.3 biopsies per 1000 women. Avail-
able studies of screening with MRI or ultrasonography
focus on high-risk women and are outside the scope of
this systematic review. No randomized trials of the effi-
cacy of the different imaging technologies for breast
cancer screening have been published, and evidence
on their benefits and harms for screening recommen-
dations is lacking.
Limitations of this review include the use of English-
language articles only, which could have resulted in
language bias, although we did not identify non–
English-language studies that otherwise met inclusion
criteria in our searches. We included only studies that
are applicable to current practice in the United States
to improve clinical relevance for the USPSTF. The num-
ber, quality, and applicability of studies varied widely,
and most studies were observational, with designs for
which quality rating criteria are not available.
In conclusion, false-positive results are common
and lead to additional imaging and biopsies, particu-
larly with annual screening and among younger women
and those with dense breasts. Although overdiagnosis,
anxiety, pain, and radiation exposure may cause harm,
their effects on individual women are difficult to esti-
mate and vary widely.

Screening
Key Questions:
For women aged ≥40 y  :
   1. What are the harms† of routine mammography screening, and how do they differ by age, risk factor‡,
   and screening interval?
   2. How do the harms† of routine breast cancer screening vary by screening modality§?
Treatment
Early detection of
invasive breast
cancer
Reduced:
   Advanced disease
   Treatment morbidity
Reduced mortality:
   Breast cancer
   All-cause
Women
aged ≥40 y
KQs 1 and 2
Harms
of screening
Harms of
treatment
*
*
KQ = key question.
* Excludes women with preexisting breast cancer; clinically significant BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Cowden syndrome,
hereditary diffuse gastric cancer, or other familial breast cancer syndrome; high-risk lesions (ductal carcinoma in situ, lobular carcinoma in situ,
atypical ductal hyperplasia, or atypical lobular hyperplasia); or previous large doses of chest radiation (≥20 Gy) before age 30 y.
† False-positive and false-negative mammography results, biopsy recommendations due to false-positive mammography results, overdiagnosis and
resulting overtreatment, anxiety, pain, and radiation exposure.
‡ Family history; breast density; race/ethnicity; menopausal status; current use of menopausal hormone therapy or oral contraceptives; prior benign
breast biopsy; and, for women aged >50 y, body mass index.
§ Mammography (film, digital, or tomosynthesis), magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasonography, and clinical breast examination (alone or in
combination).

Hendrick, 2010 (91)
Modeling study
U.S.-based sources
40 to 80
Theoretical estimates based on
long-term follow-up of acute
exposures to higher levels of
ionizing radiation and a
linear no-threshold
extrapolation of risks at low
doses. Model assumes 3.7
mGy to 4.7 mGy per
examination.
Breast cancer cases and
mortality
LAR of breast cancer incidence
and mortality,
per 100 000 women:
40 y: 5-7 cases; 1.3-1.7
deaths
50 y: 2-3 cases; 0.7-0.9
deaths
80 y: 0.1-0.2 cases; <0.1
death
LAR of breast cancer incidence
and mortality in women
undergoing annual
screening mammography,
per 100 000 women:
Screening 40-80 y: 72-91
cases; 20-25 deaths
Screening 50-80 y: 31-40
cases; 10-12 deaths
Yaffe and Mainprize,
2011 (92)
Modeling study
U.S.-based sources
40 to 74
Model based on digital
mammography and
radiation exposure estimates
of 3.7 mGy per examination.
Estimated lifetime
radiation-induced
breast cancer cases
and deaths
Number of radiation-induced
breast cancer cases and
deaths in 100 000 women:
Annual screen 40-49 y: 59
cases; 7.6 deaths
Annual 50-59 y: 27 cases; 3.1
deaths
Biennial 50-59 y: 14 cases;
1.6 deaths
Annual 40-59 y: 85 cases; 11
deaths
Annual 40-49 y, biennial to
59 y: 73 cases; 9 deaths
Annual 40-55 y, biennial to
74 y: 86 cases; 11 deaths
LAR = lifetime attributable risk.
