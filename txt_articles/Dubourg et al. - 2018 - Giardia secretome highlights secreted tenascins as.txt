Abstract
Background: Giardia is a protozoan parasite of public health relevance that causes gastroenteritis in a wide range of hosts.
Two genetically distinct lineages (assemblages A and B) are responsible for the human disease. Although it is clear that
differences in virulence occur, the pathogenesis and virulence of Giardia remain poorly understood. Results: The genome of
Giardia is believed to contain open reading frames that could encode as many as 6000 proteins. By successfully applying
quantitative proteomic analyses to the whole parasite and to the supernatants derived from parasite culture of
assemblages A and B, we confirm expression of ∼1600 proteins from each assemblage, the vast majority of which are
common to both lineages. To look for signature enrichment of secreted proteins, we considered the ratio of proteins in the
supernatant compared with the pellet, which defined a small group of enriched proteins, putatively secreted at a steady
state by cultured growing trophozoites of both assemblages. This secretome is enriched with proteins annotated to have
N-terminal signal peptide. The most abundant secreted proteins include known virulence factors such as cathepsin B
cysteine proteases and members of a Giardia superfamily of cysteine-rich proteins that comprise variant surface proteins,
high-cysteine membrane proteins, and a new class of virulence factors, the Giardia tenascins. We demonstrate that
physiological function of human enteric epithelial cells is disrupted by such soluble factors even in the absence of the
trophozoites. Conclusions: We are able to propose a straightforward model of Giardia pathogenesis incorporating key roles
for the major Giardia-derived soluble mediators.

Giardia secretome
Background
With some 280 million symptomatic cases, giardiasis causes
more bouts of human illness than any other parasitic disease
[1]. The mechanism and mediators of pathogenesis by Giardia,
however, remain largely unknown. Thanks to human volunteer
studies, the association of Giardia infection itself, and the sig-
nificance of the virulence of the infecting Giardia strain, is ex-
perimentally unambiguous [2]. The molecular definition asso-
ciated with strain virulence, though, is largely unexplored. It is
clear that the majority of Giardia infections are asymptomatic.
It is also clear that infection is primarily localized to the duode-
num and that some localized damage, close to the sites of col-
onization, causes villus atrophy and apoptosis of surrounding
cells. However, this localized damage cannot be the sole cause
of the profound diarrhoea that is often characteristic of the dis-
ease and that appears to affect absorption over a much wider
area of the digestive tract than the site of infection alone.
One of the secreted mediators of damage to the duodenum
is believed to be cathepsin B protease [3]. Cathepsin B-like pro-
teases compose one of the superfamilies belonging to the CA
clan of cysteine peptidases [4]. Compared with other cathepsins,
cathepsin B proteases possess an additional 20 amino acid inser-
tions, named the occluding loop, that enable their function as an
endo- or exopeptidase [5]. Although 27 genes encoding cathep-
sin proteases have been identified in Giardia, for the majority
of these proteases, function remains elusive [6]. While some
parasites may secrete cathepsin B proteases to either evade or
modulate their host’
s immune responses [7], a recent study has
demonstrated that Giardia trophozoites secrete cathepsin B–like
proteases, degrading intestinal IL-8 and thereby reducing the in-
flammation reaction by the host [3]. Secreted Giardia cathepsin B
protease (GCATB) may also contribute to degradation of intesti-
nal mucin and facilitate trophozoite attachment to intestinal ep-
ithelia [8, 9].
Most
of
the
proteomic
studies
so
far
reported
for
Giardia were undertaken in trophozoites undergoing encystation
[10–12]. Only a few studies have focused on proteins secreted
by Giardia and their role in the host-pathogen interaction [3,
13–15]. These studies were focused on parasite interaction
with intestinal cell lines. No studies have yet attempted to
quantify proteins that are the product of steady state secretion
by healthy, growing Giardia trophozoites, which we hypothesize
as the primary mediators of giardiasis pathology. In this study,
we have identified, to the limit of existing technology, the
proteins expressed by populations of healthy, growing human
infective Giardia trophozoites. We have provided quantitation
of the relative abundance of retained and released trophozoite
proteins from 2 human infective assemblages, affording cal-
culation of the specific enrichment of released proteins and
thereby the description of which proteins are most likely to be
secreted by trophozoites of each assemblage. Thereafter, we
compared the profile of enrichment between the 2 assemblages
in order to identify conserved as well as assemblage-specific
secreted proteins. We provide electrophysiological analysis that
confirms that trophozoite-secreted molecules adversely affect
the homeostasis of enteric epithelia, and our analysis of the
heterogeneity of encoding genes between lineages demon-
strates the direct selective pressure on these virulence factors
and affords their use in discriminating clinically important
strains and outbreaks. Finally, the discovery of tenascins as a
highly represented and variable group of proteins secreted by
trophozoites strongly implicates this new class of virulence
factors in a novel model for the mechanism of Giardia patho-
genesis. We propose that tenascin action follows degradation
of the protective mucous afforded by the action of a secreted
nuclease and GCATB, and damage to cellular junctions by
GCATB. Tenascins act by means of epidermal growth factor
(EGF) receptor ligation, to prevent repair to those damaged
junctions.
Data Description
Soluble and cytosolic fractions from in vitro grown assemblage
A and B trophozoites, the aetiologic agents of human giardiasis,
were extracted in order to establish which proteins are secreted
in the steady state by healthy, growing trophozoite populations.
We reasoned that secreted proteins would be overrepresented in
the medium in which parasites were incubated compared with
the trophozoites that produced them. This ostensibly straight-
forward assessment relied on the sensitive, specific, and quanti-
tative detection of the proteins expressed by Giardia trophozoites
in whole cells and in the medium in which the trophozoites were
incubated.
The WB (assemblage A: ATCC 50803) and GS (assemblage B:
ATCC 50581) reference strains were utilized to facilitate ease
of comparison between genetically divergent human infective
isolates with the available reference genomes. For each ex-
periment, trophozoites were harvested from mid–log growth
and incubated in nonsupplemented Dulbecco’
s Modified Eagle
medium (DMEM) for 45 minutes at 37◦C before supernatants and
pellets were collected for proteomic and other analyses includ-
ing validation of their viability by flow cytometry (Additional
file 1: Fig. S1). Proteomic analyses were based on samples from
3 distinct biological replicates. Each sample was analysed us-
ing 2 quantitative proteomic platforms, the Orbitrap MS and the
Q-Exactive MS. Thus, in total, the results from 24 (2 × 2 × 2 × 3)
proteomic analyses are reported.
The identification of abundant, secreted, Giardia virulence
factors led us to consider whether the secretions from Gia-
rdia alone could affect changes in the behaviour of enteric
epithelia—even in the absence of the trophozoites themselves.
In order to determine the effect of Giardia trophozoite–secreted
factors on the intestinal epithelia, chopstick-type electrodes
connected to a voltmeter were used to measure the trans-
epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) of polarized CaCo-2 epithe-
lial cells grown on permeable supports. CaCo-2 cells were cul-
tured over 6 days until confluent. TEER across the developing
CaCo-2 monolayer was measured on a daily basis, as shown in
Fig. 2A. Once confluence was established, Giardia trophozoites
were added to the apical side of the confluent epithelium, and
after 24 hours’incubation, the trophozoites were washed from
the apical surface. In order to determine whether co-cultures of
Giardia trophozoites or diluted Giardia supernatants affected the
ion channels responsible for secretory movement across the ep-
ithelium, an Ussing chamber system was utilized with different
chloride secretion inhibitors and activators.
Further details about sample collection, secretome analysis,
and electrophysiology can be found in the Methods section and
protocols provided.

Protein expression in Giardia trophozoites
To describe definitive Giardia secretomes under a standard set
of conditions with high confidence and based on a robust
dataset and to reduce the potential for technical artefact, the
2 MS techniques, Q-Exactive and Orbitrap MS, were used with
similar settings on the same 3 independent replicates to

The secretome of human infective Giardia trophozoites of assemblage A and B have a conserved repertoire of abundant secreted factors identified by both Orbitrap MS
and Q-Exactive MS. Fifteen proteins were identified as most likely to be secreted by both GS and WB isolates. Thirteen are annotated proteins, and 2 are hypothetical
proteins. Proteins are ranked according to GS Q-Exactive supernatant (SP) protein abundance, from most to least abundant. Of the 12 annotated proteins, 5 are tenascins
and 3 are related high-cysteine membrane proteins or VSP, and 3 are cathepsin Bs. The other annotated abundant secreted proteins are an extracellular nuclease and
PNPO. Protein ranking represents the proteins’rank within this table, from most to least abundant. Detailed breakdowns of the secretome for each assemblage by each
method are provided in Supplemental Tables S1–S4.

increase coverage. Only proteins identified by both techniques
within the 3 replicate datasets were included in the analysis to
increase the robustness of the data. The protein quantification
was performed using a label-free method: intensity-based abso-
lute quantification (iBAQ), which calculates the sum of parent
ion intensities of identified peptides per protein [16]. The aver-
age normalized abundance was divided by the iBAQ values, giv-
ing the “Abundance-iBAQ.” The quantitative datasets from both
MS techniques and for each independent replicate were shown
to be strongly correlated by a Spearman correlation test (data
not shown) and therefore exploitable for proteomic analysis.
The Q-Exactive MS identified almost all of the proteins iden-
tified by use of the Orbitrap MS, and in total the 2 techniques
identified 1587 GS proteins and 1690 WB proteins (Additional File
1: Fig. S2). This represents more than a quarter of the open read-
ing frames predicted by the respective genomes in this single
life cycle stage under this steady state set of in vitro culture con-
ditions and compares favourably with other recent proteomic
analyses of Giardia [17, 18]. Lists of proteins detected in only 1
of the 2 assemblages are provided (Additional file 2: Tables S1
and S2). Protein from 2 of the 8 predicted assemblage-specific
genes previously identified by comparative genomics was de-
tected [19].
Overall, both assemblages gave comparable and consistent
results using both platforms, with the sensitivity of detection
being greater for Q-Exactive MS, which provided a range of de-
tection spanning 5 logs. In total, Q-Exactive MS identified 1542
GS proteins and 1641 WB proteins (Fig. S3). Of these, 946 GS pro-
teins were present in both pellet and supernatant, 27 in the su-
pernatant only, and 569 GS proteins in pellet only. By compari-
son, 490 WB proteins were identified in supernatant and pellet
and 24 in the supernatant only, with 1127 WB proteins in pellet
only.
Giardia secretome
To evaluate supernatant enrichment, proteins identified in the
supernatant (SP) datasets were gathered and compared with
their concentration in the pellet (P) to provide a ratio using the
following formula:
SP abundance−i B AQ
P abundance−i B AQ
. These proteins were then
ranked from highest to lowest by ratiometric value, and an ar-
bitrary cutoff was invoked such that the top 50 were considered
the most likely to be secreted. Proteins identified only in SP were
also included in the analysis as most likely to be secreted. All the
proteins selected as “of interest” were ranked according to their
SP expression from most to least abundant to obtain a quantita-
tive enrichment profile for each isolate, and this was performed
for each platform. Orbitrap and Q-Exactive enrichment pro-
files were compared, and proteins were considered most likely
to be enriched in the supernatant when identified as such by
Q-Exactive MS and confirmed by Orbitrap MS. The different en-
richment profiles were then also compared between assem-
blages.
The results yielded a set of 15 orthologous proteins that
were identified in both isolates by both techniques (Table 1).
Eleven of these were predicted to possess an N-terminal sig-
nal sequence. Just 2 of these were of unknown function, and
2 groups dominated the annotated genes encoding the rest of
these proteins; 5 were annotated as tenascins and 3 as cathepsin
B cysteine proteases. The most abundant enriched protein was
found to be pyridoxamine 5’
-phosphate oxidase (PNPO), a flavin
mononucleotide–dependent enzyme capable of fixing molecular

oxygen that lacks a signal peptide and which was also recently
identified as a secreted Giardia trophozoite protein upregulated
during interaction with epithelial cells [15]. An extracellular nu-
clease was also present, along with a high-cysteine membrane
protein, as well as a protein product of a gene misannotated as
a variant surface protein (VSP; as it was well conserved between
assemblages).
We considered that where proteins were shown to be en-
riched in the supernatant by both platforms and in both assem-
blages and possessed an N-terminal signal sequence, they were
truly secreted proteins. Secreted proteins involved in adapting
Giardia to the host environment of the human gut might be ex-
pected to be engaged in Red Queen evolution and have dN/dS
indicative of positive selection. While amino acid divergence be-
tween orthologs of secreted proteins varied considerably from
67% for the high-cysteine membrane protein (HCMP) to 83% for,
e.g., the extracellular nuclease, only 3 proteins showed evidence
of positive selections, 2 tenascins and 1 of the cathepsins. One
cathepsin and 1 tenascin in particular showed evidence of evo-
lution under a very high degree of selective pressure (Table 1).
Interestingly, some cathepsins and some tenascins with similar
levels of amino acid identity between the assemblages to those
under high selective pressure showed little or no evidence of
positive selection.
We considered whether lineage-specific soluble mediators
might also be present and identified by this method, compar-
ing those proteins identified by both methods as having the
highest relative expression in the supernatant (Tables S3 and
S4). The 5 most abundant conserved secreted proteins from Ta-
ble 1 were also present in the top 10 secreted proteins from
each assemblage amongst other VSPs, tenascins, and cathep-
sin B, and this regardless of the MS technique or the isolate.
Unsurprisingly, VSPs were the primary proteins enriched in su-
pernatants that were lineage-specific. Amongst the multigene
families, however, there were also differences in the cathep-
sin B and tenascins/HCMP repertoires. No other proteins with
N-terminal peptides were encoded in either assemblage except
for 1 CxC-rich protein. Interestingly, none of the 8 proteins en-
coded by assemblage-specific genes and identified by compara-
tive genomics was found to be enriched in the supernatants.
When comparing secretion profiles between the 2 assem-
blages, 7 proteins were over-represented in the supernatants
by only 1 assemblage or only identified by Q-Exactive MS or
present at very low abundance in 1 of the 2 (Table 2). Only 2
proteins, sentrin and A-type flavoprotein lateral transfer candi-
date, were present in the top 50 proteins of assemblage B (GS
strain) trophozoites secretome, whereas the other 5, 1 elonga-
tion factor 1-α (EF-1α), 1 ATP-binding cassette protein 5, 1 CxC-
rich protein, 1 translation initiation inhibitor, and a peptide me-
thionine sulfoxide reductase MsrB, were present in the top 55
proteins of assemblage A (WB strain) trophozoites secretomes.
Interestingly, A-type flavoprotein lateral transfer candidate was
also present in the top 50 supernatant proteins by assemblage
A trophozoites; however, its low supernatant enrichment ratio
(<0.2) suggests that this protein is unlikely to be secreted by as-
semblage A trophozoites.
Giardia soluble mediators disrupt intestinal cell
functions
Soluble and diffusible agents, able to disrupt gut function,
could potentially mediate more diffuse and profound pathol-
ogy for giardiasis than close range interactions between the
trophozoites and the gastrointestinal epithelium alone. To de-
termine whether Giardia-secreted virulence factors could induce
changes in the behaviour of the intestinal epithelium, short-
circuit current (Isc) was continuously measured across polar-
ized CaCo-2 epithelial cells that had either been cultured with-
out any additions, co-cultured with Giardia trophozoites, or co-
cultured with diluted (1:1000) Giardia supernatants (Fig. 2B). Fur-
ther experiments demonstrated that either after 24-hour co-
culture with Giardia (Fig. 2C) or 24-hour co-culture with diluted
Giardia supernatants (Fig. 2D), both experimental conditions dra-
matically inhibit both the cAMP-stimulated Isc (basolateral ap-
plication of 10 μM of forskolin) and the calcium-activated Isc
(basolateral application of 100 μM of UTP). In order to identify
which ion channels were being affected, the CFTR chloride ion
channel inhibitor, GlyH101 (50 μM), and the calcium-activated
chloride ion channel inhibitor, DIDS (100 μM), were added to the
apical side of the Ussing chamber. The cAMP-stimulated Isc is
predominantly due to activation of CFTR chloride channels as it
is inhibited by GlyH101 (Fig. 2B–D). The calcium-activated Isc is
predominantly due to activation of calcium-activated chloride
channels as it is inhibited by DIDS (Fig. 2B–D).
Discussion
In this study, we have identified proteins secreted by tropho-
zoites of both human-infecting assemblages. Contaminating
host serum proteins (mainly bovine albumin) in the supernatant
samples were a concern, as previously described by others [20].
Such serum proteins bind to the parasite’
s surface and are con-
tinuously released, which interferes with the characterization
of Giardia secretome. To overcome this issue, parasites were
cleansed from the serum proteins and incubated in serum-free
DMEM before collecting supernatants and pellets. To increase
the coverage and robustness of the analysis, 2 mass spectrome-
ters (Orbitrap and Q-Exactive MS) were used on the same repli-
cates, and proteins identified by both MS were included in the
analysis.
Previous studies have focused on protein secretion during
Giardia trophozoite encystation; or protein secretion upon inter-
action with (or attachment to) host cells. Here instead, we chose
to provide a detailed baseline from cultured Giardia trophozoites
secreting proteins under a steady state in vitro. Nevertheless, our
results are strongly supportive of a recent proteomic study look-
ing at the effect of host attachment on the profile of Giardia-
secreted proteins [15]. Prior to that study, several metabolic en-
zymes had been proposed to be released by Giardia trophozoites
upon interaction with intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) [13], such
as arginine deiminase (ADI), enolase, and ornithine carbamoyl-
transferase (OCT), which we were also able to identify from the
culture supernatants of both assemblages.
Our study does confirm the previously observed enrichment
of EF-1α in assemblage A culture supernatants (Table 2; Table
S4) [20]. EF-1α is a key enzyme in the protein synthesis process
in eukaryotic cells [21], but many organisms have been shown
to express EF-1α in excess, which suggests that this protein may
have some other functions [21]. In the context of pathogenic-
ity and virulence, the secreted Leishamnia EF-1α has been shown
to downregulate host inflammatory cell signalling [22]. In Giar-
dia, EF-1α has been shown to be an immunoreactive protein rec-
ognized by antibodies from patients who have previously had
giardiasis [20]. Yet its role as putatively secreted virulence fac-
tor in Giardia pathogenesis remains elusive. That this protein
is only released by assemblage A trophozoites raises the pos-
sibility of associating its function with observable differences in

Human infective Giardia trophozoites of assemblage A and B secrete a small set of different proteins. Seven proteins were identified as the most likely to be secreted by either GS or WB isolates. T
wo are the most likely to be
secreted by GS isolate (shown in italics), and 5 are the most likely to be secreted by WB isolate (shown in bold). One GS isolate secreted and 2 WB isolates secreted were identified only via Q-Exactive MS in the other assemblage’
s
dataset (shown in underline). The abundance ranking represents the protein ranking within the secretome of both assemblages according to their abundances in the supernatant.

Giardia secretome
pathogenesis or host range between the 2 human infective as-
semblages.
Our study shows some other differences in secretions be-
tween assemblage A and B trophozoites (Table 2). A-type flavo-
protein lateral transfer candidate and sentrin were present in as-
semblage B (GS strain) trophozoites secretome; ATP-binding cas-
sette (ABC) protein 5, CxC-rich protein, translation initiation in-
hibitor, and peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase (MsrB) were
present in assemblage A (WB strain) secretome.
A-type flavoprotein lateral transfer candidate has a high oxy-
gen reductase activity during Giardia infection, suggesting an O2
scavenging function upon release in the host intestinal environ-
ment [23], thus potentially affording increased resilience to Gi-
ardia trophozoites in the small intestine and manipulating the
parasites’ immediate microenvironment. Whether assemblage
B trophozoites require A-type flavoprotein lateral transfer can-
didate throughout the infection or just in its early stage remains
unclear. Sentrin is involved in the ubiquitination of proteins to
render them resistant to degradation [24]. Sentrin is evolution-
arily conserved and has been identified in prokaryotic and eu-
karyotic organisms such as S. cerevisiae, A. thaliana, and Homo
sapiens, which suggests a conserved specialized function in cell
metabolism [24]. With its ubiquitination function, sentrin was
expected to be only present in Giardia proteome but not in its se-
cretome. Why this protein would be secreted or released by Gia-
rdia trophozoites remains unclear and raises the question of the
advantages, for the parasite, of releasing sentrin into the host
environment upon infection.
ABC proteins are a large and diverse canonical group of mem-
brane proteins typically resident in the plasma membrane and
associated, in eukaryotes, with the ATP-dependent egress of
metabolites and toxins; they can be determinants of virulence
and drug resistance [25]. Here 1 Giardia ABC protein shows en-
richment in the supernatant of WB but not of GS, and it will be
interesting to see if a functional correlation can be found. The
CxC-rich protein belongs to the HCMP superfamily, which also
includes VSPs, tenascins, and HCMPs. The presence of orthologs
in both strains is consistent with it not being a VSP protein. As
with several other HCMPs, this CxC-rich protein had a very high
signal and only 1 TM domain suggesting that it may be a labile
surface protein in WB, but its specific role and why it is much
more abundant in the WB supernatant than the GS supernatant
is not clear. Translation initiation inhibitors are proteins inhibit-
ing the initiation of the translation of messenger RNA (mRNA)
into proteins and are mainly located in the cell cytosol [26]. Yet,
1 translation initiation inhibitor is over-represented in the as-
semblage A trophozoite secretome (top 20 secreted proteins),
probably due to its high solubility and stability. Peptide methio-
nine sulfoxide reductase (MsrB) catalyzes the reduction of free-
and protein-bound methionine sulfoxides to corresponding me-
thionines, which constitutes a mechanism for the scavenging of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsible for a fundamental in-
nate defence against pathogens in various host organisms [27].
MsrB is an antioxidant protein protecting organisms from the
cytotoxic effects of ROS and therefore from cell death. This pro-
tein is crucial for the virulence of S. typhimurium and the im-
mune evasion of Schistosoma mansoni [28, 29]. Whether msrB has
a similar role in Giardia assemblage A pathogenicity remains
unclear.
The difference in secretion between the 2 human infective
assemblages observed in this study may also go some way to
explaining the differences in pathogenesis, symptoms, and host
range previously observed between assemblage A and B.
The most abundant proteins, in both human isolates,
primarily belong to 4 families of proteins: GCATB, high-
cysteine membrane proteins, variant surface proteins, and
tenascins.
The cathepsin B family of Giardia are confirmed virulence
factors involved in many of the parasite’
s processes such as
encystation and excystation [6]; secreted GCATBs degrade host
IL-8 and inhibit neutrophil chemotaxis [3]. GCATB contains se-
creted and nonsecreted trophozoite-expressed proteins; the or-
thologues of which are predominantly common to GS (B) and
WB (A) assemblages (Fig. 1). Expression of 16 GCATBs was pro-
teomically confirmed, of which 11 were shown by our proteomic
analysis to be secreted. These 11 fell into 6 orthologous groups,
and for 3 of these groups, all group members were shown to
be secreted. Secreted GCTAB GL50803 15564 (WB) and its or-
tholog GL50581 2036 (GS) show dN/dS values of >26, indicative
of strong positive selective pressure. Interestingly, when GS was
resequenced, GL50803 15564 was found to comprise 3 recently
diverged orthologs (GSB 153537, GSB 155477, GSB 150353), and
it may be that the positive selection pressure observed has been
generated as a result of recent gene duplications in the assem-
blage B strain. GL50803 16779, an assemblage A (WB) GCATB,
has previously been shown to be upregulated and involved in
trophozoite motility in the early pathogenesis of Giardia [15]. In
this study, this protein was found to be in WB’
s top 5 secreted
proteins (Table S4); its GS ortholog (GL50581 78) was also present
but at a considerably lower level, suggesting that for this GCATB
may play a more significant role in assemblage A than assem-
blage B.
HCMPs are an enigmatic group of proteins with few associ-
ated functional studies. They may protect trophozoites against
proteolysis [30, 31] and oxidative damage [32]. In Giardia, it ap-
pears that 1 lineage of HCMPs has given rise to the VSPs, while
another has given rise to a group with high homology to mam-
malian tenascins. Tenascin, VSPs, and HCMPs are then related
multigene families that together form the largest group of pro-
teins enriched in the Giardia supernatants. Interestingly, when
aligned and analysed phylogenetically, the secreted tenascins
segregate into a monophyletic group (Fig. S4). Both WB and GS
orthologs of 5 tenascin gene products were secreted, and in WB,
2 other secreted tenascins were also detected that were not de-
tected for the GS strain (Fig. 1B).
VSPs
are
well-characterized
surface
glycoproteins
with
transmembrane domains, which are expressed one at a time
by Giardia trophozoites through an RNAi-regulated mechanism.
They are quintessential virulence factors, responsible for anti-
genic variation. VSPs are hypervariable by nature, and thus it is
to be expected that they do not form orthologous pairs. This was
the case for most we observed; intriguingly though, a few pro-
teins annotated as VSPs were conserved between isolates, sug-
gesting that they are not actually VSPs and would not be subject
to “one at a time” controlled expression—but are actually mis-
annotated HCMPs, which may have a conserved function in both
GS and WB isolates. This study was not able to resolve whether
the enrichment of such proteins in the supernatant observed is
due to clipping or shedding from the parasite surface or whether
the proteins are also secreted.
Tenascins are characterized by the presence of EGF repeats
and are able to act as ligands for EGF receptors. Mammalian
tenascins are extracellular matrix proteins, which modulate
cell adhesion and migration [33]. They appear to have evolved
from a group of proteins specific to vertebrates, presumably
co-evolving with the EGF receptor, and so the presence of homol-
ogous proteins in Giardia evolving independently from HCMPs
is a clear example of the kind of convergent evolution best de-
scribed as molecular mimicry. Interestingly, a Giardia tenascin
(WB-GL50803 8687/GS-GL50581 4316), secreted by both strains,

and
Giardia
tenascin
(WB-GL50803 14573/GS-GL50581 1475),
secreted only by the WB strain (Table 1; Table S4), were found
to be induced by host soluble factors and implicated in the
regulation of trophozoite attachment [15], supporting the case
for secreted tenascins acting as virulence factors in Giardia
pathogenesis.
Most published studies concerning host cell–Giardia inter-
actions have focused on the effects on the host intestinal ep-
ithelia upon attachment of the trophozoites to the cells. In this
study, we have shown that diluted supernatant obtained from
the steady growth of Giardia trophozoites in vitro has an effect
on the intestinal cell function. The effect observed on chloride
secretion by Giardia supernatants indicates that Giardia secretes
a soluble factor, which is likely affecting secretion across the in-
testinal epithelial cells. Physiologically, cultured intestinal cells
show sensitivity to Giardia proteins released by the parasite even
at high dilution. Fig. 2D demonstrates that intestinal epithelial
cells when acutely exposed to such Giardia proteins lose the abil-
ity to stimulate CFTR and calcium-activated chloride channels,
the clear implication being that virulence determinants released
from Giardia trophozoites interact with epithelial cell receptors
and ion channels.
In this analysis, we have identified the proteins that are se-
creted by human infective Giardia trophozoites. Just 2 groups
form the majority of these proteins, GCATBs and the HCMP su-
perfamily, encoding known virulence factors in addition to an
abundant extracellular nuclease and an oxygen-fixing enzyme.
The elucidation of this group of proteins dramatically increases
our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying
giardiasis at a molecular level. The genes encoding GCATBs
and HCMP superfamily proteins are among the most heteroge-
neous of all genes between assemblages. Their probable role in
interaction with the host and luminal environment is sup-
ported by the very high dN/dS values of some family mem-
bers. Correlation of variation within assemblages at these loci
with strain virulence is the essential next step for their use in
the diagnosis of virulent strains, risk assessment, and disease
prognosis.
Our results indicate that Giardia secretions are sufficient to
disable normal function in enteric epithelial cells, making them
less able to extract fluids from the lumen. In particular, they im-
plicate PNPO, an extracellular nuclease, GCATBs, and tenascins.
The fact that both extracellular nuclease and GCATBs can be
involved in the degradation of the intestinal mucus layer and
that both GCATBs and tenascins can be associated with intesti-
nal intracellular junction disruption suggests collaboration be-
tween these proteins. Therefore, we propose a pathogenic mech-
anism (Fig. 3) whereby PNPO produces a reducing environment
favouring growth of trophozoites and the extracellular nucle-
ase degrades the outer layer of the intestinal mucus, improving
access for GCATBs for further degradation of the protective mu-
cous barrier and subsequent disruption of intestinal intracellu-
lar junctions. Lastly, tenascins are involved in maintaining in-
testinal cell separation by ligation of EGF receptors present at the
surface of intestinal cells and exacerbation of epithelial damage
via increased levels of apoptosis amongst these more detached
cells. Once the intestinal barrier is breached by the actions of
Giardia-secreted virulence factors, the sites of damage become
prone to secondary infection by other opportunist microbes res-
ident in the intestinal lumen and sensitive to irritation by aller-
gens in foodstuffs, leading to further inflammation and to the
characteristic symptoms of the disease. Further investigations
are necessary to verify this proposed mechanism of the patho-
genesis of giardiasis.

resistance in CaCo-2 monolayers following seeding on permeable supports. Data show an increase in TEER as the monolayer develops. Confluence occurred around
day 6. Giardia were added on day 6 after the confluent monolayer formed and co-cultured with the Caco-2 monolayer for 24 hours. TEER was measured after 24 hours
and compared with TEER in monolayers that had not been exposed to Giardia (n = 6). (B) A representative short circuit current (Isc) against time recording from

and calcium-activated chloride channels (basolateral application of 100 μM of UTP). Specificity of activation is confirmed by inhibition of Isc by the specific CFTR
channel blocker, GlyH101; and specific calcium-activated chloride channel blocker, DIDS. The effect on Isc of 24-hour co-incubation of CaCo-2 monolayers with Giardia
or with Giardia supernatant (1:1000 dilution) is also shown. (C) Effect of 24-hour co-incubation of CaCo-2 monolayers with different strains of Giardia (WB, GS, and

samples) on forskolin-stimulated and UTP-stimulated Isc (n = 3) from Caco-2 monolayers. The results were analysed by the Student t test and expressed as mean
values ± standard error mean (SEM). Significant difference expressed as ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01 compared with control.
Methods
Proteomic analysis
Sample preparation
Giardia trophozoites from the genome reference strains WB (as-
semblage A, ATCC 50803) and GS (assemblage B, ATCC 50581)
were cultured in TYI-S-33 under standard conditions (5% CO2)
[34] and harvested during the mid–log phase of their in vitro
growth curves. The total trophozoites (adhered and nonadhered)
were washed ×3 in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and then incu-
bated in nonsupplemented DMEM, with antibiotics to conserve
an axenic milieu, for 45 minutes at 37◦C (Fig. S5A) [38]. After
incubation, an aliquot was analysed by flow cytometry to eval-
uate the viability of the Giardia samples. Trophozoites and su-
pernatant were separated by centrifugation, and both tropho-
zoite pellet and supernatant were harvested. Proteins con-
tained in supernatant were concentrated in Vivaspin columns
(3000 MWCO) with 25 mM of ammonium bicarbonate (Ambic)
(Fig. S5 B) [39]. Supernatants were analysed by SDS PAGE [40]
and were tested on cultured epithelial cells (Caco-2) to ensure
the presence of proteins and biological activity (see below). Su-
pernatants and pellets were sent to the Institute of Infection and
Global Health at the University of Liverpool for mass spectrom-
etry analysis (Fig. S3) [41].
Protein samples were dispensed into low protein-binding mi-
crocentrifuge tubes (Sarstedt, Leicester, UK) and made up to
160 μl by addition of 25 mM of Ambic. The proteins were de-
natured using 10 μl of 1% (w/v) RapiGestTM (Waters MS Tech-
nologies, Manchester, UK) in 25 mM of Ambic, followed by 3
cycles of freeze-thaw and 2 cycles of 10 minutes’ sonication
in water bath. The sample was then incubated at 80◦C for 10
minutes and reduced (addition of 10 μl of 60-mM DTT and
incubation at 65◦C for 10 minutes) and alkylated (addition of
10 μl of 180-mM iodoacetamide and incubation at room tem-
perature for 30 minutes in the dark). Trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich,
Dorset, UK) was reconstituted in 50 mM of acetic acid to a con-
centration of 0.2 μg/μl. Digestion was performed by the ad-
dition of 10 μl of trypsin to the sample, followed by incuba-
tion at 37◦C overnight. The RapiGestTM was removed from the
sample by acidification (1 μl of trifluoroacetic acid and incu-
bation at 37◦C for 45 minutes) and centrifugation (15 000 × g
for 15 minutes) [41]. After protein digestion, 1 μg of digest was
injected into both the Orbitrap Velos and the Q-Exactive MS for
all samples.

Figure 3: Proposed novel mechanism of pathogenicity for Giardia involving PNPO, extracellular nuclease, GCATB, tenascin. PNPO (
) renders the intestinal environment
more favourable to trophozoite’
s growth. Once a new Giardia colony is established, trophozoites release extracellular nuclease (
), GCATB (
), and tenascin (
).
Extracellular nuclease may contribute to reducing the viscosity of the intestinal outer mucus layer, while GCATB may degrade mucins and disrupt intracellular junction.
Finally, tenascins may maintain intestinal cells apart by attaching to the EGF receptors present at the surface of intestinal cells that could, over time, lead to the
apoptosis of these isolated intestinal cells.
Orbitrap Velos
Peptide mixtures were analysed by online nanoflow liquid chro-
matography using the nanoACQUITY-nLC system (Waters MS
technologies, Manchester, UK) coupled to an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos
(ThermoFisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) mass spectrome-
ter equipped with the manufacturer’
s nanospray ion source. The
analytical column (nanoACQUITY UPLCTM BEH130 C18 15 cm ×
75 μm, 1.7-μm capillary column) was maintained at 35◦C and a
flow rate of 300 nl/min. The gradient consisted of 3%–40% ace-
tonitrile in 0.1% formic acid for 90 minutes, then a ramp of 40%–
85% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid for 3 minutes. Full scan MS
spectra (m/z range 300–2000) were acquired by the Orbitrap at a
resolution of 30 000. Analysis was performed in data-dependant
mode. The top 20 most intense ions from the MS1 scan (full MS)
were selected for tandem MS by collision-induced dissociation
(CID), and all product spectra were acquired in the LTQ ion trap.
Ion trap and orbitrap maximal injection times were set to 50 ms
and 500 ms, respectively.
Q-Exactive MS
Digests (2 μl) were analysed on a 50-cm Easy-Spray column with
an internal diameter of 75 μm, packed with 2-μm C18 particles,
fused to a silica nano-electrospray emitter (Thermo Fisher Sci-
entific). Reversed phase liquid chromatography was performed
using the Ultimate 3000 nano system with a binary buffer sys-
tem consisting of 0.1% formic acid (buffer A) and 80% acetonitrile
in 0.1% formic acid (buffer B). The peptides were separated by a
linear gradient of 5%–40% buffer B over 110 minutes at a flow rate
of 300 nl/min. The column was operated at a constant temper-
ature of 35◦C, and the LC system coupled to a Q-Exactive mass
spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The Q-Exactive was op-
erated in data-dependent mode with survey scans acquired at a
resolution of 70 000 at m/z 200. Up to the top 10 most abundant
isotope patterns with charge states +2, +3, and/or +4 from the
survey scan were selected with an isolation window of 2.0 Th
and fragmented by higher-energy collisional dissociation with
normalized collision energies of 30. The maximum ion injection
times for the survey scan and the MS/MS scans were 250 and 100
ms, respectively, and the ion target value was set to 1E6 for sur-
vey scans and 1E4 for the MS/MS scans. Repetitive sequencing
of peptides was minimized through dynamic exclusion of the
sequenced peptides for 20 seconds.
Data analysis
Thermo RAW files were imported into Progenesis LC–MS
(version 4.1, Nonlinear Dynamics, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK).
Replicate runs were time-aligned using default settings and an
auto-selected run as a reference. Peaks were picked by the soft-
ware using default settings and filtered to include only peaks
with a charge state of between +2 and +6. Peptide intensities of
replicates were normalized against the reference run by Proge-
nesis LC-MS. Spectral data were transformed to .mgf files with
Progenesis LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrome-
try) and exported for peptide identification using the PEAKS
Studio 7 (Bioinformatics Solutions Inc., Waterloo, Canada)
search engine. A multiple–search engine platform provided
by PEAKS Studio named inChorus was used, which combines
searching results from PEAKS DB (Bioinformatics Solutions

The search parameters for Orbitrap-Velos were as follows; pre-

was set to 0.01 Da. One missed tryptic cleavage was permitted.
Carbamidomethylation was set as a fixed modification, and
oxidation (M) set as a variable modification. The false discovery
rates (FDRs) were set at 1%, and at least 2 unique peptides
were required for reporting protein identifications. Protein
abundance (iBAQ) was calculated as the sum of all the peak

of theoretically observable tryptic peptides [16]. Protein abun-
dance was normalized by dividing the protein iBAQ value by the
summed iBAQ values for that sample. The reported abundance
is the mean of the biological replicates.
The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been de-
posited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE part-
ner repository [24] with the dataset identifier PXD004398 and

Electrophysiology
Giardia trophozoites culture
Giardia lamblia WB and GS strains as well as the patients’strains
(obtained from 3 patients with giardiasis from the NNUH) were
grown in filter-sterilized, modified TYI-S-33 medium with 10%
adult bovine serum and 0.05% bovine bile [28] at 37◦C in mi-
croaerophilic conditions and subcultured when confluent. To
collect parasites for experiments, the medium was removed
from the culture to eliminate unattached or dead parasites. The
tube was refilled with cold, sterile medium, and trophozoites de-
tached by chilling on ice for 15 minutes.
Parasites were collected by centrifugation (1500 × g for 5
minutes at 4◦C) and washed once with the plating medium of
90% complete DMEM/10% Giardia medium. Parasites were then
counted using a haemocytometer and diluted to the appropriate
number.
To collect Giardia supernatant for experiments, the Giardia
culture bottle was placed on ice for 15 minutes. The bottle then
underwent centrifugation (1500 × g for 5 minutes at 4◦C). The su-
pernatant was then collected and filtered 3 times using 15-mm
diameter syringe filters (0.2-μm pore size). Subsequently, the
postfiltered Giardia supernatant was diluted 1:1000 and saved in
a –20◦C freezer until required.
Mammalian cell line (CaCo-2) preparation
CaCo-2 cells (passages 20–25) were grown in DMEM supple-
mented with nonessential amino acids, penicillin (12 IU/ml),
streptomycin (12 μg/ml), gentamycin (47 μg/ml), and 20%
(vol/vol) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (all from AMIMED,
Bioconcept). The cells were seeded at a density of 6 × 104
cells/cm2 in 6-well Transwell filters (0.4-μm pore size) and cul-
tured for 7–15 days until confluent. Confluent monolayers were
then used for electrophysiological experiments, for co-culture
experiments with Giardia parasites, or for culture with Giardia
supernatants [42].
CaCo-2 co-culture experiments with Giardia or Giardia supernatant
Confluent CaCo-2 monolayers were taken, and the CaCo-2
cell media was removed and replenished with a combination
of 90% complete DMEM/10% Giardia medium plus or minus
Giardia trophozoites (100 000 total parasites per insert). Control
cultures were maintained in a separate plate to prevent parasite
contamination. Control inserts were inspected under the micro-
scope to ensure there was no Giardia cross-contamination. The
co-cultures were incubated at 37◦C and 5% CO2 for 24 hours, af-
ter which the Giardia parasites were removed [42].
Confluent Caco-2 monolayers were also cultured with diluted
(1:1000) Giardia supernatants for 24 hours. Briefly, the culture
media was removed from the insert, and Caco-2 cell media was
replaced with a combination of 99.9% complete DMEM/0.1% Gi-
ardia medium plus or minus Giardia supernatant [42].
Transepithelial electrical resistance assay
Monolayers of CaCo-2 cells were grown on 6-well Transwell fil-
ters (0.4-μm pore size) for 7–15 days until confluent. The devel-
opment of the polarized monolayer was assessed by measuring
the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) over a 7–15-day
period. Once confluent, Giardia were added to the apical side of
the Transwell filter and incubated for 24 hours. The integrity of
the confluent polarized monolayer was assessed by measuring
the TEER before and/or after apical infection by Giardia [42].
Electrophysiology assay
Monolayers of CaCo-2 cells on Transwell filters were mounted
into a Physiological Instruments EM-CSYS-2 Ussing chamber
setup after establishment of a confluent monolayer, and the
short circuit current (ISC) across the monolayer was continuously
measured [42].
Both sides of the epithelium were bathed in 5 ml of Krebs
Henseleit solution, which was continuously circulated through
the half chambers, maintained at 37◦C, and continuously bub-
bled with 95% O2/5% CO2. The composition of the Krebs Hense-
leit bath solution used was similar to that used by Cuthbert
[35] and had the following composition (in mM): NaCl 118, KCl
4.7, CaCl2 2.5, MgCl2 1.2, NaHCO3 25, KH2PO4 1.2, and glucose
11.1 (pH 7.4). The permeable supports were left for 30 minutes
to equilibrate before experiments were started. All filters were
treated with 10 μM of amiloride apically to eliminate electro-
genic sodium absorption through epithelial sodium channels
[42].
Data analysis
ISC was continuously monitored across the monolayers by a
Physiological Instruments Multichannel Voltage/Current Clamp
(VCC MC6) through 3M KCl/agar, Ag/AgCl2 cartridge electrodes
(Physiologic Instruments), and the raw data for Isc, transepithe-
lial resistance, and transepithelial voltage were recorded using
Acquire and Analyse version 1.3 software (Physiological Instru-
ments). Data were exported to Microsoft Excel initially and then
into the GraphPad Prism version 5.0 for Windows package for
data representation and statistical analysis.

Phylogeny
To look for sequence similarities between proteins of interest
from the same protein family, the coding sequences of these pro-
teins were retrieved from GiardiaDB (v 3.1, 4.0, and 5.0), aligned,
and compared using ClustalW.
Phylogenetic trees were built for these proteins via the max-
imum likelihood approach using MEGA software (v. 6.06).
Availability of supporting data

Figure S1: Giardia trophozoites are viable after incubation in
nonsupplemented DMEM. Parasites were chilled on ice for 15
minutes, washed 3 times in prewarmed PBS, centrifuged 10 min-
utes at 3000 rotations per minute (rpm) between each wash; and
then incubated in prewarmed nonsupplemented DMEM for 45
minutes at 37◦C. After 45 minutes’ incubation, parasites were
chilled on ice for 5 minutes and centrifuged for 10 minutes at
3000 rpm. Pellets were collected and respuspended in PBS (A2
and B2). Trophozoites collected from culture and respuspended
in either PBS (A3 and B3) or 2% trigene (detergent; A3 and B3)
were used as life and death controls, respectively. Proportion of
living/dead trophozoites by flow cytometry; 5 μl of propidium io-
dide (PI) was added in each sample to stain DNA liberated in the
milieu after cell death. Flow cytometry was performed using the
BD AccuriTM C6 flow cytometer, with a blue laser (λ = 488 nm)
and an optical filter 585/40. Gates P2 and P3 represent living and
dead trophozoites, respectively. (A) Flow cytometry analysis for

and B obtained with both MS platforms. Both GS and WB pellets
(P) and supernatant (S) replicates were analysed via Orbitrap and
Q-Exactive MS. Supernatant protein expression profiles are sim-
ilar to each other within each assemblage; so are pellet protein
expression profiles (graphs). A total of 1690 and 1587 proteins
were identified for assemblage B and A, respectively (Venn dia-
grams), via both MS techniques. For assemblage A (WB isolate),
1170 proteins were present in both datasets, and 49 and 471 pro-
teins were identified only in the Orbitrap MS and Q-Exactive MS
datasets, respectively. For assemblage B (GS isolate), 1106 pro-
teins were present in both datasets, and 42 and 439 were iden-
tified only via Orbitrap Ms and Q-Exactive, respectively, for as-
semblage B.

Figure S5: Protocol to harvest Giardia pellet and supernatant
for proteomic analysis. (A) Preparation of Giardia supernatant
and pellet samples for proteomic assay. Parasites were chilled
for 20 minutes, transferred into 15-ml falcon tubes, and cen-
trifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes. Supernatants were dis-
carded, and pellets were washed 3 times in warmed 1xPBS
(4 ml, 2 ml, and 1 ml, respectively). Pellets were then incubated,
under standard growth conditions and in filtered glass tubes,
for 45 minutes at 37◦C either in (1) nonsupplemented DMEM
containing phenol red or (2) nonsupplemented phenol red-free
DMEM. After 45 minutes’incubation, parasites were chilled for
5 minutes, transferred in 15-ml falcon tubes, and centrifuged at
3000 rpm for 10 minutes. Pellets were stored at –20◦C. Proteins
present in supernatant samples were concentrated prior to per-
forming the proteomic assay. (B) Protocol to concentrate proteins
contained in Giardia supernatant samples prior to proteomic as-
say. Supernatants were transferred in Vivaspin columns with a
3000 MWCO and centrifuged at 12 000 relative centrifugal force
(rcf) for 30 minutes. Proteins were washed up to 3 times with 25
mM of Ambic (depending on the presence of phenol red within
DMEM) and centrifuged at 12 000 rcf for 30 minutes. Then, 50
μl of 25 mM Ambic was added, and samples were left at room
temperature for 1 hour; there was a final spin at 3000 rcf for 2
minutes to recover proteins using BCA.

prewarmed PBS, centrifuged for 10 minutes at 3000 rpm be-
tween each wash, and then incubated in prewarmed nonsupple-
mented DMEM for 45 minutes at 37◦C. After 45 minutes’incuba-
tion, parasites were chilled on ice for 5 minutes and centrifuged
for 10 minutes at 3000 rpm. Supernatants were collected, and
SDS-PAGE on 12% agarose gels, using a SYPRO staining, and
