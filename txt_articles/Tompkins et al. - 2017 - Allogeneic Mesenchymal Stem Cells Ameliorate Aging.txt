Abstract
Background: Aging frailty, characterized by decreased physical and immunological functioning, is associated with stem cell depletion. Human 
allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells (allo-hMSCs) exert immunomodulatory effects and promote tissue repair.
Methods: This is a randomized, double-blinded, dose-finding study of intravenous allo-hMSCs (100 or 200-million [M]) vs placebo delivered 
to patients (n = 30, mean age 75.5 ± 7.3) with frailty. The primary endpoint was incidence of treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TE-
SAEs) at 1-month postinfusion. Secondary endpoints included physical performance, patient-reported outcomes, and immune markers of 
frailty measured at 6 months postinfusion.
Results: No therapy-related TE-SAEs occurred at 1 month. Physical performance improved preferentially in the 100M-group; immunologic 
improvement occurred in both the 100M- and 200M-groups. The 6-minute walk test, short physical performance exam, and forced expiratory 
volume in 1 second improved in the 100M-group (p = .01), not in the 200M- or placebo groups. The female sexual quality of life questionnaire 
improved in the 100M-group (p = .03). Serum TNF-α levels decreased in the 100M-group (p = .03). B cell intracellular TNF-α improved in 
both the 100M- (p < .0001) and 200M-groups (p = .002) as well as between groups compared to placebo (p = .003 and p = .039, respectively). 
Early and late activated T-cells were also reduced by MSC therapy.

 Conclusion: Intravenous allo-hMSCs were safe in individuals with aging frailty. Treated groups had remarkable improvements in physical 
performance measures and inflammatory biomarkers, both of which characterize the frailty syndrome. Given the excellent safety and efficacy 
profiles demonstrated in this study, larger clinical trials are warranted to establish the efficacy of hMSCs in this multisystem disorder.

There is increasing recognition of the health burden of frailty, a syn-
drome that increases in incidence with aging. Frailty confers an increased 
vulnerability to adverse health outcomes and mortality in response to 
stressors (1,2). Of note, the frailty syndrome is driven mostly by bio-
logical aging processes that include inflammation and stem cell dysfunc-
tion, as opposed to chronological aging (2–5). Early intervention may 
improve quality of life, reduce hospitalizations, and nursing home costs 
(6,7). Therefore, it is increasingly important to recognize the clinical 
onset of frailty, and to develop effective therapeutic strategies.
There are two main models used to define frailty (7): The defi-
cit and the physical phenotype model. The deficit model accounts 
for a person’s geriatric syndromes, diseases, psychosocial, physical, 
and cognitive impairments, and combines them to create a “Frailty 
Index” (8). The physical phenotype model consists of the identifi-
cation of at least three factors: weight loss, exhaustion, weakness, 
slowness, and decreased physical activity, which together comprise 
an underlying state of multisystem dysregulation (9,10). Despite the 
use of different criteria for evaluating frailty, both models show evi-
dence that the prevalence of the syndrome increases with age and is 
higher among women (9.6%) than men (5.2%) (11). In a study of 
over 44,000 community-dwelling elderly adults, the overall preva-
lence of frailty was found to be 10.7% (11).
Currently, several multimodal interventions are employed to man-
age frailty, namely resistance/aerobic exercise, caloric support, vita-
min D, and optimization of polypharmacy (7). However, there are 
no specific medical or biologic treatments that ameliorate or reverse 
frailty (12,13). Stem cell depletion is a key mechanism postulated to 
contribute to frailty (14–16). In this regard, we recently conducted a 
phase I open label study of human allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells 
(allo-hMSCs) intravenously infused for frailty, which showed that the 
cells could be safely administered, improved measures of functional 
capacity, and reduced inflammation (17). Therefore, we conducted the 
current phase II double-blinded and placebo-controlled study in order 
to test the hypothesis that exogenous allo-hMSCs could reverse signs 
and symptoms of frailty in older individuals. Similar approaches have 
been shown to exert beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system, 
with functional improvements on various types of heart disease (18–
20), endothelial function (21), and systemic inflammation (22). Given 
their pleiotropic mechanisms of action, which include antifibrotic, 
anti-inflammatory, proangiogenic properties (23), and their ability to 
stimulate endogenous progenitor cells (21,24), we hypothesize that 
their use may offer a novel treatment strategy in frail patients.
Methods
The AllogeneiC Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Patients 
with Aging FRAilTy via IntravenoUS Delivery (CRATUS) study 
(#NCT02065245) is a phase II, randomized, double-blinded, pla-
cebo-controlled study of allo-hMSCs delivered intravenously (IV) 
in frail individuals to test the safety and efficacy of allo-hMSCs in 
reducing markers of inflammation and improving markers of physi-
cal and mental functioning and quality of life (15,25).
Study Design, Stem Cell Procurement and 
Randomization
The study design and phase I of the CRATUS study have been 
recently published (17,26). Screening and patient randomization 
are outlined in Figure 1 (26), and available in the Supplementary 
Material.
Patient Inclusion Criteria and 
Timeline
The inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) Patients were pro-
vided written informed consent, (ii) patients were aged ≥60 and 
≤95 years at the time of signing the Informed Consent Form, and 
(iii) they showed the signs of frailty based on physician assessment, 
apart from a concomitant condition, by a score between 4 and 7 
as denoted by the Canadian Study on Health Aging (25,27,28). 
Major exclusion criteria and a detailed timeline have been pub-
lished (26).
Study Endpoints
The primary endpoint was the safety of allo-hMSCs at 1 month, 
assessed by treatment emergent-serious adverse events (TE-SAE). 
TE-SAEs were defined by the following: death, nonfatal pulmonary 
embolism, stroke, hospitalization for worsening dyspnea, and clini-
cally significant laboratory abnormalities.
The secondary endpoints assessed the efficacy of the therapy. 
Efficacy was demonstrated by differences in the rate of change of 
frailty markers as defined by: reduced activity (Community Healthy 
Activities Model Program for Seniors (CHAMPS) questionnaire), 
slowing of mobility (6-minute walk test (6MWT), 4-m gait speed test 
(4MGST), and the short physical performance battery (SPPB) score, 
comprised of balance tests, gait speed tests, and chair stand tests), 
weight loss, diminished hand grip strength (dynamometry), exhaus-
tion-multidimensional fatigue inventory (MFI), quality of life assess-
ments (Sexual Quality of Life-Female (SQOL-F) and International 
Index of Erectile Dysfunction (IIEF) Questionnaires), dobutamine-
induced ejection fraction (EF) via echocardiography, C-reactive pro-
tein (CRP), IL-6, D-dimer, complete blood cell count (CBC) with 
differential, and TNF-α.
Immune Monitoring
Immune biomarkers were measured at baseline and 6 months as 
described previously (17) and in the Supplementary Material.
Statistical Analysis
No formal statistical justification was performed to determine sam-
ple size for this study. Sample size was determined to be appro-
priate for an early phase study to assess safety in this population. 
Due to the early phase nature of this study, no adjustments were 
made for multiple analyses (26). Statistical analysis was completed 
by statisticians at the Emmes Corporation and is available in the 
Supplementary Material.

Results
Patient Population
Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the enrolled patients. 
Sixty percent of the patients were White males and the mean age was 
75.5 ± 7.3 years.
Safety
No TE-SAEs occurred in any of the three groups in the first 30 days. 
Similarly, there were no cumulative treatment-related SAEs in either 
group throughout the duration of the study (Table 2). None of the 
patients showed any signs of adverse cardiopulmonary reaction 
following the intravenous infusion. There were no clinically signifi-
cant changes in basic hematologic and chemistry laboratory tests 
throughout the duration of the study.
Long-term Adverse Events
One patient in the 200M-group died of an unrelated event prior 
to the 12-month follow-up. Additionally, one patient in the placebo 
had an unrelated stroke 307 days postinfusion. The proportion of 
patients with adverse events at 12 months did not differ between 
groups at the 6- and 12-month time points (p = .300 and p = .141, 
respectively).
Hospitalization
There were four patients who required hospitalization within the 
12-month follow-up. Two of the hospitalizations were reported in 
one patient in the 100M-group, both of which were moderate in 
severity; however, none of the hospitalizations were secondary to the 
procedure. No patients in the 200M-group were hospitalized. The 
remaining three patients belonged to the placebo group; one patient 
had two moderate hospitalizations and one severe, another had a 
hospitalization that was moderate in severity, and another had one 
severe hospitalization. None of the hospitalizations were related to 
the procedure.
Functional Status, Quality of Life, and Pulmonary 
Function
Quality of life and functional status were monitored throughout the 
study. These outcomes preferentially improved in patients randomized 
to receive 100M allo-hMSCs. The 6MWT increased in the 100M-group 
from baseline to 6 months (345.9 ± 103.4 to 410.7 ± 155.4 m, p = .011; 
Figure 2A). There was no significant change at 6 months (p = .263) in 
either the 200M-group or placebo (p = .112). The 4MGST showed no 
significant differences among groups (p = .659) at 6 months. Consistent 
with the improvement in 6MWT, the SPPB total score was significantly 
improved in the 100M-group from baseline to 6 months (median 
10.5, IQR 9.0, 12.0 to 12.0, IQR 11.0, 12.0; p = .031; Figure 2B). 
However, there were no significant differences in the 200M-group 
(p = .812) or placebo (p = .875). The CHAMPS-questionnaire showed 
a reduced total caloric expenditure per week at moderate intensity in 
the 200M-group from baseline to 6 months (median 5,118.8, IQR 
1,470.0, 1,4542 to 1,509.4, IQR 472.5, 6,090.0; p = .008) and pla-
cebo (median 3,386.3, IQR 1,286.3, 4,042.0 to 2,021.3, IQR 682.5, 
3,150.0; p = .039; Figure 2C). Conversely, there was no significant 
reduction in the 100M-group at 6 months (p = .641). There were no 
differences between groups in weight loss (p = .7599), MFI, which 
assessed mental fatigue (p = .548), and handgrip strength as assessed 
via the average of dominant hand scores (p = .676). Ejection fraction, 
assessed by dobutamine stress echo, remained stable throughout the 
study in all patients. FEV1 improved in the 100M-group from base-
line to 6 months (2.5 ± 0.66 to 2.6 ± 0.77 L/min, p = .025) without 
significant changes in the 200M-group (p = .259) or placebo (p = .883; 
Figure 2D).

 Immune Biomarkers
Immunotolerability was assessed using a calculated PRA (cPRA) 
measured at baseline and 6 months postinfusion on each patient. 
Three patients had a mild/moderate increase in donor specific anti-
bodies (one mild in the 100M- and two moderate in the 200M-group). 
There were two other patients in the 200M-group that had a mild/
moderate increase in cPRA but were not donor-specific reactions 
(Table 3). There were no clinically significant immune reactions 
reported. Both the 100M and 200M doses were effective in modu-
lating immune parameters whereas placebo was not. Reduction 
in the early-activation CD69 cells was noted in the 200M-group 
(27.0 ± 4.30 to 16.4 ± 7.25%, p = .004; Figure 3A) at 6 months. 
There were no reductions in the 100M-group (p = .269) or placebo 
(p = .0797; Figure 3A). There was a reduction in the late-activation 
CD25 cells in both the 100M-group (12.6 ± 6.87 to 6.9 ± 3.30%, 
p = .007) and 200M-groups (12.0 ± 6.68 to 8.0 ± 4.64%, p = .048) 
from baseline to 6 months. No significant reduction was noted in the 
placebo (p = .119; Figure 3B). The CD8 T-cell marker decreased signif-
icantly in the 200M-group from baseline to 6 months (28.7 ± 15.04 
to 19.9 ± 10.03%, p = .022; Figure 3C). This is a crucial finding 
as aging is marked by an expansion of CD8 cells (29). There were 
no significant changes in the 100M-group (p = .978) or placebo at 
6 months (p = .0797; Figure 3C). There were no significant changes 
in CD4 cells in the 200M-group (p = .052), 100M-group (p = .135), 
or placebo (p = .540). The CD4/CD8 ratio appropriately increased 
in the 200M-group at 6 months (1.2 ± 1.05 to 1.9 ± 1.17, p = .014), 
however there were no changes in the 100M-group (p = .609) or 
placebo (p = .104; Figure 3D).
Serum TNF-α decreased in the 100M-group at 6 months (median 
3.2, IQR 2.8, 3.8 to 1.2, IQR 1.0, 2.8, p = .031), whereas it did 
not significantly change in the 200M-group (p = .129) or placebo 
(p = .094; Figure 3E). Similarly, B cell intracellular TNF-α signifi-
cantly decreased in both the 100M- and 200M-groups (17.3 ± 1.8 to 
7.0 ± 1.0, p < .0001, and 17.1 ± 2.0 to 8.4 ± 1.1, p = .001, respectively; 
Figure 3F) with no improvement in placebo at 6 months (p = .69). 
The reductions in both the 100M- and 200M-groups were significant 
compared to placebo (p < .00001 and p = .00002; Figure 3F). Finally, 
there were no significant changes noted in IL-6, CRP, D-dimer, CBC, 
or fibrinogen at 6 months in any group (data not shown).
Sexual Quality of Life
Among female patients, the SQOL-F exhibited a remarkable increase 
in the 100M-group at 6 months (59.8 ± 15.3 to 76.0 ± 12.9, p = .035), 
but no changes were observed in the 200M-group (p = .882) or pla-
cebo (p = .941; Figure 4). Conversely, there were no differences among 
male participants in the IIEF from baseline to 6 months (p = .666).

Note: There were no TE-SAEs at 1 month or SAEs in either group. One patient died in the 200M-group unrelated to the treatment. There were seven hospitaliza-

frailty. The results support the safety and feasibility of administering 
allo-hMSCs in this population. With regard to efficacy, there was a 
preferential effect towards improvement of functional capacity and 
patient reported outcome measures in patients receiving lower dose 
MSCs, although immunologic bioactivity was evident with both 
doses. Together, these findings suggest that allo-hMSCs may be an 
effective biological modifier of aging frailty, and support ongoing 
investigation of allo-hMSCs alone or as an adjunct to current physi-
cal training strategies for aging frailty.
These findings are in agreement with a recently completed 
 
dose-finding phase I safety study (17). In that study, two impor-
tant sets of observations were made. First, a constellation of physi-
cal  
performance measures improved with cell therapy, and second, 
100M cells represented the peak responsiveness dose, with a pla-
teau and/or reduction in efficacy being noted with 200M cells. 
Accordingly, this study was based, in part, on phase I. Importantly, 
randomizing patients in a double-blind fashion to 100M cells, 200M 
cells, or placebo was performed to validate the results of the earlier 
study and to  confirm both the constellation of physical performance 
findings and the dose–response.
The findings here replicate in large part the results of the earlier 
open label study, support the concept that MSCs have bioactivity 
against aging frailty, and confirm the fact that 100M represents a 
superior dose level compared to 200M. The reasons underlying the 
inverse dose relationship noted here remain incompletely understood. 
The 100M dose group produced significant improvements in both 
physiologic and immunologic markers of frailty, while the high dose 
group solely demonstrated positive immunomodulatory effects. It is 
important to note that there is a precedent for this in earlier studies, 
and a number of stem cell-based clinical trials exhibit greater effects 
with lower doses (19,30). However, the available preclinical and clin-
ical evidence regarding dose relationship in stem cell therapy is con-
flicting (31), with some studies reporting that lower cell dosage and/
or infusion cell concentration may provide the most benefit (19,32), 
while others finding either a direct or nonlinear relationship (33).
There are several factors that could contribute to nonlinear dose 
response curves with cell-based therapy. These include variation in 
functional activity of the cells rather than the absolute number of cells 
infused. In this regard, higher cell concentrations could impair cell 
activity through physical effects such as concentration-dependent cell 
aggregation, or damage of cells due to excessive shear forces on cells 
during infusion that could influence the relationship between cell dose 
and clinical benefit (31). Therefore, studies have recently been focus-
ing on cell activity and or genetic modification to enhance their activ-
ity, rather than quantity (34,35). However, as with all progenitor cell 
types in various disease processes, whether modified or not, exact dos-
ing has yet to be established, and thus is a weakness of this particular 
study. Given the novel use of MSCs in frailty, a patient population for 
whom a successful therapy has yet to be developed, dosing was based 
on safety as established by previous studies (18,19) and phase I (17), 
and was further investigated in the current study. Importantly, safety 
was ultimately established in both cell-dose groups. The optimal effec-
tive dosing will be investigated in future larger randomized trials.
In the current study, we employed allo-hMSCs, which can 
target two pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of aging 
frailty—inflammation and stem cell depletion. The current 
findings support the idea that biological modification of aging 
frailty is not only feasible but has the potential to meaningfully 
impact the physical performance of older individuals with mild 
to moderate. It is noteworthy that the effects on inflammatory

 cytokines may have practical value by providing a clinical use-
ful biomarker. Importantly, both circulating TNF-α levels as well 
as B-cell intracellular TNF-α appear to be candidate biomakers 
that could be used to index the efficacy of hMSCs in this patient 
population.
The 6MWT, SPPB-questionnaire, FEV1, and the CHAMPS-
questionnaire were among the physical performance measures 
examined in our study, and the 100M-group in particular produced 
a meaningful outcome in all measures. The 6MWT was originally 
designed to evaluate cardiac and pulmonary disorders; recently, its 
application has expanded to assess an individual’s exercise capac-
ity at various levels of intensity and their ability to walk safely in a 
community setting (36,37). Similarly, the SPPB is a physical measure 
utilized to identify an individual’s future risk of disability, institu-
tionalization, and mortality in the elderly adults (38). CHAMPS was 
created to improve physical activity in the elderly (39). The survey 
utilizes a series of questions to measure physical activities which are 
then employed to estimate caloric expenditure per week (39,40). 
Together with measures of pulmonary function, these factors are of 
great importance in an individuals’ ability to remain mobile and active 
in a community setting. Other quality of life measures included sexual 
function. Although males did not experience any improvement in 
erectile dysfunction, women significantly improved their scores on the 
SQOL in the 100M-group. This is a particularly meaningful marker 
of improved quality of life, as loss of libido in postmenopausal women

is intrinsically linked to hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), a 
disorder marked by clinically significant personal distress (41).
Frailty in advancing age is associated with a heightened state 
of inflammation termed “inflammaging” (42). Markers of chronic 
inflammation, such as TNF-α and leukocytosis, are all associated 
with aging and age-related diseases (43). TNF-α in particular has 
been correlated with increased mortality in the elderly adults (44). 
MSCs harbor immunomodulatory properties and have been shown 
to decrease inflammatory markers in several studies (45,46). 
Therefore, it is not surprising that both the 100M- and 200M-cell

 doses significantly modulated the immune systems of the treated par-
ticipants. Serum TNF-α was significantly reduced in the 100M-group, 
while B cell intracellular TNF-α was reduced in both the 100M- and 
200M-groups, and as compared to placebo. Furthermore, there 
was a suppression of the late/chronically activated T-cells (CD25) 
at 6 months postinfusion. The 200M-group produced clinically sig-
nificant decreases in markers of early and late/chronic T-cell acti-
vation. Most interestingly, allo-hMSCs significantly reduced the 
percentage of CD8 T-cells. The risk for infection is increased in aging 
and is marked by a CD4/CD8 ratio less than one (29). Six months 
post-allo-hMSC treatment, there was a significant improvement 
in the immune risk phenotype of the 200M-group. These immune 
responses due to MSCs are likely to contribute salutary effects and 
could enhance health span in individuals with aging frailty.
Aging is characterized by a diminished reserve in all organ sys-
tems, with impaired stem cell production and/or function being 
implicated as contributing to the body’s inability to repair itself (47). 
Chronic inflammation in particular is not only associated with frailty, 
but also creates a detrimental environment for stem cells and their 
ability to oppose disease processes (48). Currently, most research on 
frailty has focused on improvements on physiologic reserve, with 
a focus on the dysregulation of inflammation (49). Utilizing young 
healthy individuals as donors for hMSCs, this study addresses both 
physiologic and inflammatory aspects of aging frailty.
This study is limited by a small sample size. The lack of differ-
ences between groups, with the exception of intracellular TNF-α, 
is due to the study’s small size which limits statistical power. Of 
note, the point estimate between the 100M-group and placebo in 
the physical performance metric 6MWD would require 30 patients 
per group for appropriate statistical power to detect a difference 
between groups. A future larger study is planned to address this.
In summary, the present study indicates that intravenous allo-
hMSC delivery is safe in individuals with aging frailty. Given this 
excellent safety profile coupled with promising indications of effi-
cacy in the 100M cell group, pivotal clinical trials are warranted 
to further establish the efficacy of allo-hMSCs in this multisystem 
disorder, to define optimal dosing of MSCs in this population, and 
to validate the use of inflammatory biomarkers as a useful surrogate 
of clinical outcome.
