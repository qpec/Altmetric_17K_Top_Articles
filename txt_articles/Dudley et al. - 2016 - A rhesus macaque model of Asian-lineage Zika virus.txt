Infection with Asian-lineage Zika virus (ZIKV) has been associated with Guillain–Barre
´
syndrome and fetal abnormalities, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood.
Animal models of infection are thus urgently needed. Here we show that rhesus macaques
are susceptible to infection by an Asian-lineage ZIKV closely related to strains currently
circulating in the Americas. Following subcutaneous inoculation, ZIKV RNA is detected in
plasma 1 day post infection (d.p.i.) in all animals (N ¼ 8, including 2 pregnant animals), and is
also present in saliva, urine and cerebrospinal fluid. Non-pregnant and pregnant animals
remain viremic for 21 days and for up to at least 57 days, respectively. Neutralizing antibodies
are detected by 21 d.p.i. Rechallenge 10 weeks after the initial challenge results in no
detectable virus replication, indicating protective immunity against homologous strains.
Therefore, Asian-lineage ZIKV infection of rhesus macaques provides a relevant animal model
for studying pathogenesis and evaluating potential interventions against human infection,
including during pregnancy.

 Z
ika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus first
identified in 1947 (ref. 1). Little was known about ZIKV
when fetal abnormalities and Guillain–Barre
´ syndrome
were reported coincident with epidemic spread of Asian-lineage
ZIKV in South America2–4. Animal models are essential for
quickly understanding ZIKV transmission and pathogenesis, as
well as for evaluating candidate vaccines and therapeutics.
ZIKV infects immunocompromised mice5, providing evidence
suggesting that ZIKV causes microcephaly by attacking neuronal
progenitor cells and leads to intrauterine growth restriction6–9.
However, mouse models do not mimic key attributes of human
infection and
fetal development
such as infection
in an
immunocompetent state or the same type of remodelling of the
spiral arteries and arterial vasodilation10. This remodelling of the
arteries that occurs in humans and nonhuman primates, but
not in mice, leads to high blood flow to the fetus, altering the
potential transmission of viruses.
In contrast to mice, immunocompetent macaque monkeys are
widely used in both infectious disease and obstetric research,
with similar gestation and fetal development as humans. Here we
describe infection of rhesus macaques with an Asian-lineage
ZIKV strain.
Results
Cohort definitions. To determine whether a physiologically
relevant dose and route of Asian-lineage ZIKV infects immuno-
competent pregnant and non-pregnant macaques, we inoculated
eight Indian-origin rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) sub-
cutaneously with ZIKV derived from a French Polynesian
virus isolate (Zika virus/H.sapiens-tc/FRA/2013/FrenchPolynesia-
01_v1c1). The eight animals were divided into three cohorts as
shown in Fig. 1. Cohort 1 (three male animals) received the first
ZIKV challenges and were then rested for 6 weeks before a
rechallenge. Cohort 2 (three female animals) was a repeat
experiment of cohort 1 that allowed for additional experiments
and sample collection (for example, serum infectivity) that were
not feasible when we initiated cohort 1 studies. Animals in cohort
3 (two pregnant animals) were challenged on two different days.
Both cohort 3 animals are currently in the once weekly sampling
phase until the pregnancies come to term (B165 gestational days).
ZIKV titrations. To define the minimal dosage necessary to
establish infection, two macaques per group were infected with
1 � 106, 1 � 105 or 1 � 104 plaque-forming unit (p.f.u.) ZIKV
(cohorts 1 and 2; Figs 1 and 2a). This dose range of inocula is
based on the previous work in related flaviviruses such as West
Nile virus and dengue virus, where it is estimated that mosquitoes
deliver 1 � 104 to 1 � 106 p.f.u. of virus11,12. This is also the range
found in mosquito saliva in a recent publication specifically
evaluating Brazilian Zika virus13.
Clinical
evaluation
of
ZIKV-infected
rhesus
macaques.
To detect signs of morbidity, animals were evaluated daily for
evidence
of
disease,
injury
or
psychological
abnormalities
(for example, inappetence, dehydration, diarrhoea, depression,
inactivity,
trauma,
self-injurious
or
stereotypical
repetitive
behaviours (for example, pacing) often seen in captive animals).
Five of six animals exhibited mild-to-moderate inappetence,
which resulted in mild weight loss in four animals. Two animals
(912116 and 393422) also developed a very mild rash around the
inoculation site at 1 day post infection (d.p.i.) that persisted
for 4–5 days. No other abnormal clinical signs were noted
(for example, increased body temperature, joint pain, lympha-
denopathy and lethargy).
Daily complete blood counts (CBCs) were evaluated for all six
non-pregnant animals for 10 d.p.i. and then every 3–7 days
thereafter
and
serum
chemistry
analyses
were
performed
intermittently post infection as per the protocol (Supplementary
Fig. 1). Reference intervals (RIs) developed for the Wisconsin
National Primate Research Center (WNPRC) colony for species,
gender and age were used to evaluate results. All six animals
developed elevated serum creatine kinase (CK), which peaked by
5 d.p.i. (Supplementary Fig. 1d). Increases in serum CK are
strongly associated with muscle damage and myositis (skeletal,
smooth and cardiac), but can also be caused by repeated sedation,
haemolysis
and
endocrine
abnormalities14,15.
Predictable
increases in CK have been noted in nonhuman primates
undergoing repeated sedation and venipuncture15. However,
CK levels did not remain elevated during the 10-day period of
daily sedation and blood collection, suggesting other causes for
the noted increase in values. Future studies are planned to
determine whether CK increases may be due to viral myositis.
Alanine aminotransferase values in three of six animals exceeded
the maximum WNPRC RI (Supplementary Fig. 1c) and the
expected increase associated with repeated ketamine sedation15.
Although aspartate aminotransferase values exceeded upper RI
values for all six non-pregnant animals after infection, they did
not increase above the expected levels previously associated with
repeated ketamine sedation described by Lugo-Roman et al.15
(Supplementary Fig. 1b).
All the animals displayed decreased total white blood cell
(WBC) numbers following infection, but only one animal fell
below the RI with a value of 2.88 ths ml � 1 (3.70–15.70). WBC
numbers rebounded almost completely to pre-infection levels
B10 d.p.i. in all six animals (Supplementary Fig. 1e). Both
animals that received the highest dose of inoculum developed
persistent mature neutrophilia B7–14 d.p.i. that lasted through
28 d.p.i. Five of six non-pregnant animals had mild regenerative
anaemia characterized by varying degrees of polychromasia and
anisocytosis, but whether this was secondary to the viral infection
or simply a result of frequent blood collections could not be
determined. Platelet values for all six animals remained within RI.
Both cellular dyscrasias and elevated transaminases have been
described in human ZIKV case reports; myositis has not been
reported16,17.
ZIKV detection in blood. Blood was sampled daily for
10–11 d.p.i. and every 3–7 days thereafter. Viral RNA (vRNA)
was quantified by quantitative PCR with reverse transcription
(qRT–PCR) from plasma18 and was detected in all six animals at
1 d.p.i. (Fig. 2b). Peak plasma viremia occurred between 2 and
6 d.p.i., and ranged from 8.2 � 104 to 2.5 � 106 vRNA copies per
ml. Infectious titres, measured from serum in cohort 2 animals,
were 500–1,000-fold less than copies of vRNA detected from
plasma at the same time points (Fig. 2c). Copies of vRNA
detected
in
the
serum
and
plasma
were
very
similar
(Supplementary Fig. 2). The estimated doubling time for
plasma viremia averaged 7.7 h (range ¼ 4.8–10.2 h) and was
independent of the infecting dose and sex of the macaque. By
10 d.p.i., plasma viral loads were undetectable (o100 vRNA
copies
per
ml)
in
all
six
animals,
although
intermittent
low-level detection (o550 vRNA copies per ml) continued
sporadically
through
17 d.p.i.
(Fig.
2b).
Thereafter,
vRNA
remained undetectable in all fluids throughout follow-up (longest
follow-up 70 d.p.i.; Fig. 2b, insets).
ZIKV detection in other body fluids. We also measured ZIKV
vRNA by qRT–PCR in other body fluids including urine, saliva,
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and vaginal fluid. Viruria was detected

 starting at 2–5 d.p.i. and as late as 17 d.p.i., in urine passively
collected from cage pans (Fig. 2b). Despite possible degradation
of virus between the time of urination, and sample collection and
processing, 1 � 103–1 � 104 vRNA copies per ml urine was
detected at multiple time points. Virus was also detected in oral
swabs collected from all six animals, peaking at over 1 � 103
vRNA copies per sample in three of six animals (Fig. 2b). Notably,
as with urine, the kinetics of virus detection in saliva occurred
after peak plasma viremia. Cisterna magna punctures were
performed at 4 and 14 d.p.i. to quantify vRNA in CSF; vRNA was
detectable at 4 d.p.i. in three out of five animals from which CSF
could be obtained (Fig. 2d). Vaginal swabs collected from the
three female animals in cohort 2 had detectable vRNA starting at
1 and/or 7 d.p.i., but were undetectable at 14, 21 and 28 d.p.i.
(Fig. 2e).
Rhesus macaque innate and adaptive immune responses to ZIKV.
We next characterized the immune response to infection by
staining
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
(PBMCs)
for
multiple lineage and activation markers. Proliferating (Ki-67 þ)
natural killer (NK) cells, CD8 þ T cells and CD4 þ T cells
expanded above baseline levels by 6 d.p.i. (Fig. 3a,b). NK and
CD8 þ
T-cell expansion increased as plasma vRNA loads
decreased starting at 6 d.p.i. We also enumerated circulating
plasmablasts, defined as CD3 �/20 �/14 �/16 �/11c �/123 � and
CD80 þ/HLA-DR þ cells, on 0, 3, 7, 11 and 14 d.p.i. (Fig. 3c)19.
The peak plasmablast expansion occurred between 7 and 10 d.p.i.
in five out of six animals. Serum neutralizing antibody (nAb)
responses were also measured by plaque reduction neutralization
tests (PRNT90). All animals exhibited high nAb titres as early as
14 d.p.i. (Fig. 3d), the earliest time point tested. Cohort 1 animals
were tested at 64 d.p.i. and cohort 2 animals were tested at 14 and
28 d.p.i. Together, these data suggest that peak activation of the
adaptive immune response and antibody production occur
5–7 d.p.i.
and
may
both
be
important
to
control
viral
replication as evidenced by reducing vRNA loads in the plasma
at these time points.
To determine whether the activation of T cells correlated with
the appearance of ZIKV-specific responses, we performed
interferon-gamma (IFNg) enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot
(ELISPOT) on PBMCs collected at 4, 10 and 14 d.p.i. for
animals in cohort 2. Cells were stimulated with pools of 15-mer
peptides collectively representing the amino-acid sequence of the
Asian-lineage NS5 protein (GenBank: KU321639). We detected
specific IFNg secretion in response to 12 of 16 peptide pools in at
least one animal (Supplementary Fig. 3). Overall, this data
support that there are ZIKV-specific T-cell responses in all
animals tested.
Protection from rechallenge with ZIKV. To determine whether
the immune responses that we detected following primary
challenge
were
protective
against
homotypic
rechallenge,
we rechallenged the three animals in cohort 1 10 weeks after
primary infection with 1 � 104 p.f.u. of the Zika virus/H.sapiens-
tc/FRA/2013/FrenchPolynesia-01_v1c1 strain (Figs 1 and 2b,
inset). Plasma, urine and saliva vRNA loads remain negative to at

Figure 1 | Schematic representation of the timeline of infection and sampling for each animal in the presented studies. Cohort 1 received the first ZIKV
challenges and was then rested for 6 weeks before a rechallenge. For all studies, samples were collected daily for 10 days and then on 14, 21 and 28 d.p.i. as
indicated by hashes in the timelines. Cohort 3 represents the two pregnant animals that were challenged on two different days. Both animals are currently
in the once weekly sampling phase until the pregnancies come to term (B165 gestational days). Cohort 2 was a repeat experiment of cohort 1 that allowed
for additional experiments and sample collection (for example, serum plaque infectivity) that were not feasible when we initiated cohort 1 studies. These
animals are currently in a 6-week rest period and will be rechallenged on 6 June 2016. Ages of all animals are indicated under each macaque identification

 maintained persistent plasma viremia (vRNA copies per ml) to
57 þ and 29 d.p.i. (Fig. 4b). This is similar to a case previously
described by Driggers et al.3, where a pregnant mother had
persistent ZIKV vRNA detected from 35 to 70 d.p.i. that did not
resolve until termination of pregnancy; the fetus was found to
have 2 � 108 copies per ml of virus in brain tissue and it is
speculated that the fetus may have been the source of the
prolonged maternal plasma viremia. We will continue to monitor
these pregnant animals for vRNA in the blood and amniotic fluid,
and will determine the infection status of the fetus on termination
of the pregnancy either at full term or earlier if necessary for the
health and safety of the mother. Amniocentesis using ultrasound

and 10 d.p.i. for 660875 and were similar to the cohort 2
(non-pregnant) animals at 28 d.p.i. (Fig. 4e). One pregnant
animal exhibited an increase in CK above the RI and above levels
expected with repeated ketamine sedation and blood collection.
The same pregnant animal also developed persistent regenerative
anaemia characterized by circulating nucleated erythrocytes.
Discussion
Altogether, our study shows the persistence of ZIKV RNA in
the plasma of rhesus macaques for B10 days, similar to other
vector-borne flaviviruses that cause acute, typically self-limiting
infections in humans. This work also shows that ZIKV infection
elicits a robust immune response including ZIKV-specific T-cell
response and nAb responses that confer protection against
reinfection. However, the prolonged detection of vRNA in urine
and saliva after apparent clearance from the blood, detection of
virus in the CSF and occasional plasma ‘blips’ after initial
clearance suggest that ZIKV may persist longer, at low levels, in
certain tissues. Future work in rhesus macaques will seek to
determine whether and where these reservoirs may exist, and
whether they seed virus into fluids that might allow for human-
to-human transmission. Last, persistence of plasma viremia
beyond 10 days was detected in both animals we infected during
the first trimester of pregnancy. Future work will determine the
source of that virus, as these pregnancies come to full term.
Our study establishes immunocompetent rhesus macaques
infected with physiologically relevant ZIKV, as a relevant
translational model for infection and pathogenesis. The large

have
been
described in detail in rhesus macaques, so this model will also
enable assessments of the impact of maternal ZIKV infection on

pregnant macaques, despite activation of NK cells and T cells as
well as development of a nAb response. We continue to follow
these pregnant animals and will establish whether fetal infection
and/or abnormalities have occurred through serial ultrasound

Methods
Study design. This was a proof-of-concept study designed to establish the
infectivity and viral dynamics of Asian-lineage ZIKV. Because nothing is known
about ZIKV dosing in macaques, one male and one female rhesus macaque of
Indian ancestry were each challenged with the following ZIKV doses: 1 � 106,
1 � 105 and 1 � 104 p.f.u. ZIKV. Two pregnant macaques at 31 and 38 days of
gestation were infected with 1x104 p.f.u. ZIKV. We selected two animals per
inoculum dose and two pregnant animals as a minimum number of animals for
this pilot study to provide proof of concept and design larger studies necessary to
place statistical significance on the findings. All macaques utilized in the study were
free of Macacine herpesvirus 1, simian retrovirus type D (SRV), simian T-lym-
photropic virus type 1 (STLV) and simian immunodeficiency virus as part of the
specific pathogen-free colony at WNPRC. All animals admitted into the specific
pathogen-free colony at WNPRC were screened for each of these viruses quarterly
for 1 year with serology test and additionally by PCR for simian retrovirus type
D and simian T-lymphotropic virus type 1. Only animals with negative tests
remained in the colony and all animals and their offspring are tested by serology
and PCR yearly for these pathogens.
Care and use of macaques. All macaque monkeys used in this study were cared
for by the staff at the WNPRC in accordance with the regulations and guidelines
outlined in the Animal Welfare Act and the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals and the recommendations of the Weatherall report (https://
royalsociety.org/topics-policy/publications/2006/weatherall-report/). This study
was approved by the University of Wisconsin-Madison Graduate School
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Animal Care and Use Protocol
Number G005401). For all procedures (that is, physical examinations, virus
inoculations, ultrasound examinations, blood and swab collection), animals were
anaesthetised with an intramuscular dose of ketamine (10 ml kg � 1). Blood samples
were obtained using a vacutainer system or needle and syringe from the femoral or
saphenous vein.
Inoculations. ZIKV strain H/PF/2013 (GenBank: KJ776791), originally isolated
from a 51-year-old female in France returning from French Polynesia with a single
round of amplification on Vero cells, was obtained from Xavier de Lamballerie
(European Virus Archive, Marseille, France). We deep sequenced the challenge
stock to verify the expected origin (see details in a section below). The ZIKV
challenge stock consensus sequence matched the GenBank sequence (KJ776791) of
the parental virus, but there were eight sites where between 5 and 40% of sequences
contained variants that appear to be authentic (six out of eight were
non-synonymous changes; Supplementary Table 1).
Virus stocks were prepared by inoculation onto a confluent monolayer of
C6/36 mosquito cells. These cell lines were obtained from American Type
Culture Collection (CRL-1660), were not further authenticated and were not
specifically tested for mycoplasma. A single harvest of virus with a titre of
1.26 � 106 p.f.u. ml � 1 (equivalent to 1.43 � 109 vRNA copies per ml) was used for
all eight challenges. The stock was thawed, diluted in PBS to the appropriate
concentration for each challenge and loaded into a 1-ml syringe that was kept on
ice until challenge. Animals were anaesthetised as described above, and 1 ml of
inocula was administered subcutaneously over the cranial dorsum. Post
inoculation, animals were closely monitored by veterinary and animal care staff for
adverse reactions and signs of disease.
vRNA isolation from plasma. Fresh plasma and PBMC were isolated from
EDTA-treated whole blood by Ficoll density centrifugation at 1,860 r.c.f. for
30 min. The plasma layer was collected and centrifuged for an additional 8 min at
670 r.c.f. to remove residual cells. RNA was extracted from 300 ml of plasma using
the Viral Total Nucleic Acid Purification kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) on a
Maxwell 16 MDx instrument. The RNA was then quantified by quantitative
RT–PCR as described in a section below.
vRNA isolation from urine. Urine was collected from a pan beneath the animal’s
cage. Urine was centrifuged for 5 min at 500 r.c.f. to remove cells and other debris.
RNA was isolated from 300 ml of urine using the Viral Total Nucleic Acid
Purification kit (Promega) on a Maxwell 16 MDx instrument.
vRNA isolation from oral swabs. Oral swab samples were collected from infected
animals while anaesthetised by gently running a sterile swab under the animal’s
tongue. Swabs were placed immediately into either RNAlater or viral transport
medium (tissue culture medium 199 supplemented with 0.5% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic) for 60–90 min. Samples were vortexed
vigorously, then centrifuged for 5 min at 500 r.c.f. before removing the swabs.
Samples were stored at either � 20 �C (RNAlater samples) or � 80 �C (viral
transport medium) until processing. Before extraction, virus was pelleted by
centrifugation for 1 h at 4 �C at 14,000 r.p.m. Supernatant was removed, leaving
the virus in 200 ml of media. vRNA was extracted from these samples using the
Qiamp MinElute Virus Spin kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) with all
optional washes. Viral load data from oral swabs are expressed as vRNA copies
per ml eluate.
Quantitative reverse transcription–PCR. vRNA isolated from plasma, urine or
oral swabs was quantified by qRT–PCR using the primers and probe designed by
Lanciotti et al.18. The RT–PCR was performed using the SuperScript III Platinum
one-step quantitative RT–PCR system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) on the
LightCycler 480 instrument (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Primers
and probe were used at final concentrations of 600 and 100 nM, respectively, along
with 150 ng random primers (Promega). Cycling conditions were as follows: 37 �C
for 15 min, 50 �C for 30 min and 95 �C for 2 min, followed by 50 cycles of 95 �C for
15 s and 60 �C for 1 min. Virus concentration was determined by interpolation
onto an internal standard curve composed of seven 10-fold serial dilutions of a
synthetic ZIKV RNA fragment based on the Asian-lineage (ZIKV strain H/PF/
2013).
Viral quantification by plaque assay. Titrations for replication competent virus
quantification of the challenge stock as well as from serum collected at multiple
time points from animals in cohort 2 were completed by plaque assay on Vero
cell cultures. Vero cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection
(CCL-81), were not further authenticated and were not specifically tested for
mycoplasma. Duplicate wells were infected with 0.1 ml of aliquots from serial
10-fold dilutions in growth media and virus was adsorbed for 1 h. Following
incubation, the inoculum was removed, and monolayers were overlaid with 3 ml
containing a 1:1 mixture of 1.2% oxoid agar and 2 � DMEM (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) with 10% (vol/vol) FBS and 2% (vol/vol) penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were
incubated at 37 �C in 5% CO2 for 4 days for plaque development. Cell monolayers
then were stained with 3 ml of overlay containing a 1:1 mixture of 1.2% oxoid agar
and 2 � DMEM with 2% (vol/vol) FBS, 2% (vol/vol) penicillin/streptomycin and
0.33% neutral red (Gibco). Cells were incubated overnight at 37 �C and plaques
were counted. Titres of virus detected from the serum of cohort 2 animals were
compared with plasma and serum viral load assays. For both the challenge stock
and the virus isolated from macaque serum, the level of infectious virus detected by
plaque assay was B500–1,000-fold less than the number of vRNA particles
detected by qRT–PCR in either the plasma or serum. This was true throughout the
duration of viremia, where plaque assay titres were detectable.
Plaque reduction neutralization test. Macaque serum samples were screened for
ZIKV nAb utilizing a PRNT. End point titrations of reactive sera, utilizing a 90%
cutoff (PRNT90), were performed as described20 against ZIKV strain H/PF/2013.
Briefly, plaque assays were set up as described above with the challenge stock of
ZIKV in the presence of different dilutions of serum from the rhesus macaque.
Immunophenotyping. The amount of activated/proliferating NK cells was
quantified using a modified version of our protocol detailed step by step in
OMIP-028 (ref. 21). Briefly, 0.1 ml of EDTA-anticoagulated whole-blood samples
were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the presence of a mastermix of
antibodies against CD45 (clone D058-1283, Brilliant Violet 786 conjugate, 2.5 ml),
CD3 (clone SP34-2 Alexa Fluor 700 conjugate, 5 ml), CD8 (clone SK2, Brilliant
Violet 510, 2.5 ml), NKG2A/C (clone Z199, PE-Cy7 conjugate, 5 ml), CD16 (clone
3G8, Pacific Blue conjugate, 5 ml), CD69 (clone TP1.55.3, ECD conjugate, 3 ml),
HLA-DR (clone 1D11, Brilliant Violet 650 conjugate, 1 ml), CD4 (clone SK3,
Brilliant Violet 711 conjugate, 5 ml), CD28 (clone CD28.2, PE conjugate, 5 ml) and
CD95 (clone DX2, PE-Cy5 conjugate, 10 ml) antigens. All antibodies were obtained
from BD BioSciences, San Jose, CA, USA, except the NKG2A/C-specific antibody,
which was purchased from Beckman Coulter, and the CCR7 antibody that was
purchased from R&D Systems. Red blood cells were lysed using BD Pharm Lyse,
after which they were washed twice in media and fixed with 0.125 ml of 2%
paraformaldehyde for 15 min. After an additional wash the cells were
permeabilized using Life Technology’s Bulk Permeabilization Reagent. The cells
were stained for 15 min with Ki-67 (clone B56, Alexa Fluor 647 conjugate) while
the permeabilizer was present. The cells were then washed twice in media and

 resuspended in 0.125 ml of 2% paraformaldehyde until they were run on a BD
LSRII Flow Cytometer. Flow data were analysed using Flowjo version 9.8.2.
IFNc ELISPOT assay. PBMCs were isolated from EDTA-treated whole blood
using Ficoll-Paque Plus (GE Health Sciences) density centrifugation. ELISPOT
assays were conducted according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, 1 � 105
cells in 100 ml of R10 medium were added to pre-coated monkey IFNg
ELISpot-PLUS plates (Mabtech Inc., Mariemont, OH, USA) with peptide at a final
concentration of 1 mM. Full proteome peptides derived from the ZIKV NS5
sequence (GenBank: KU321639.1) used in this study were synthesized by
GenScript (Piscataway, NJ, USA). Pools were created using 10 overlapping 15-mer
peptides, each at a working concentration of 1 mM. Concanavalin A (10 mM) was
used as a positive control. Assays of all samples were repeated in duplicate or
triplicate. Cells alone in the absence of stimulant were used as a negative control.
Wells were imaged by using an AID ELISPOT reader, and spots were counted
using an automated program with parameters including size, intensity and
gradient. The limit of detection was set at 100 spot-forming cells per million
PBMCs.
Plasmablast detection. PBMCs isolated from three ZIKV-infected rhesus mon-
keys at 3, 7, 11 and 14 d.p.i. were stained with the following panel of fluorescently
labelled Abs specific for the following surface markers: CD20 FITC (L27), CD80 PE
(L307.4), CD123 PE-Cy7 (7G3), CD3 APC-Cy7 (SP34-2), IgG BV605(G18-145; all
from BD Biosciences), CD14 AF700 (M5E2), CD11c BV421 (3.9), CD16 BV570
(3G8), CD27 BV650 (O323; all from BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), IgD AF647
(polyclonal; Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL, USA) and HLA-DR PE-TxRed
(TU
¨ 36; Invitrogen). LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain kit (Invitrogen)
was used to discriminate live cells. Briefly, cells were resuspended in 1 �
PBS/1%BSA and stained with the full panel of surface Abs for 30 min in the dark at
4 �C, washed once with 1 � PBS, stained for 30 min with the LIVE/DEAD Fixable
Aqua Dead Cell Stain kit in the dark at 4 �C, washed once with 1 � PBS, washed
again with 1 � PBS/1%BSA and resuspended in 2% paraformaldehyde Solution.
Stained PBMCs were acquired on a LSRII Flow Analyser (BD Biosciences) and the
data were analysed using FlowJo software v9.7.6 (TreeStar, Ashland, OR, USA).
Plasmablasts were defined similarly to the method previously described19 excluding
lineage cells (CD14 þ, CD16 þ, CD3 þ, CD20 þ, CD11c þ and CD123 þ), and
selecting CD80 þ and HLA-DR þ cells (known to be expressed on rhesus
plasmablasts and their human counterpart22).
Estimation of plasma viremia doubling time. The doubling time of plasma
viremia was estimated in R version 3.2.3 (The R Foundation for Statistical
Computing; http://www.R-project.org). For each animal, the slope of the linear
portion of the line (between 1 and 2 d.p.i. for the animals treated with 1 � 106
and 1 � 105 p.f.u., and between 1, 2 and 3 d.p.i. for the animal treated with
1 � 104 p.f.u.) was generated by plotting the log of the plasma viral loads. The linear
portion represents the exponential growth phase and has been used to estimate
doubling time in other systems23. The slopes were then used in the equation:
log(2)/slope. Each result was then multiplied by 24 h to produce a simple estimate
of doubling time in hours.
CBC and blood chemistry panels. CBCs were performed on EDTA-
anticoagulated whole-blood samples on a Sysmex XS-1000i automated
haematology analyser (Sysmex Corporation, Kobe, Japan). Blood smears were
prepared and stained with Wright-Giemsa stain (Wescor Aerospray Hematology
Slide Stainer; Wescor Inc, Logan, UT, USA). Manual slide evaluations were
performed on samples as appropriate when laboratory-defined criteria were met
(including the presence of increased total WBC counts, increased monocyte,
eosinophil and basophil percentages, decreased haemoglobin, haematocrit and
platelet values, and unreported automated differential values). Individuals
performing manual slide evaluations screened both WBCs and red blood cells for
cellular maturity, toxic change and morphologic abnormalities.
Whole blood was collected into serum separator tubes (Becton, Dickinson and
Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) for blood chemistry analysis and processed
as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Blood chemistry panels were performed
on the serum using a Cobas 6000 analyser (Roche Diagnostics, Risch-Rotkreuz,
Switzerland). Results from CBC and blood chemistry panels were reported with
species, age and sex-specific reference ranges.
ZIKV deep sequencing of the challenge stock. A vial of the same ZIKV strain
H/PF/2013 virus stock that infected macaques was deep sequenced by preparing
libraries of fragmented double-stranded complementary DNA using methods
similar to those previously described24. Briefly, the sample was centrifuged at
5,000 r.c.f. for 5 min. The supernatant was then filtered through a 0.45-mm filter.
The Qiagen QiAmp Minelute viral RNA isolation kit (omitting carrier RNA)
was used to isolate vRNA. The eluted RNA was then treated with DNAse I.
Double-stranded DNA was prepared with the Superscript double-stranded
complementary DNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) and priming with random
hexamers. Agencourt Ampure XP beads were used to purify double-stranded DNA.
The purified DNA was fragmented with the Nextera XT kit (Illumina), tagged with
Illumina-compatible primers and then purified with Agencourt Ampure XP beads.
Purified libraries were then sequenced with 2 � 300 bp kits on an Illumina MiSeq.
Of note, challenge stock viral loads were 1.43 � 109 vRNA copies per ml. This
results in an input of 7.15 � 108 RNA copies into the sequencing reactions. This far
exceeds the average depth of coverage of 11,877 (±4,658) sequences per nucleotide
site indicating little resampling effects in our data analysis.
