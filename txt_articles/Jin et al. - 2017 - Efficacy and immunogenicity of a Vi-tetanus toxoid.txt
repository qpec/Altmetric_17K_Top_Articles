Summary
Background Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S Typhi) is responsible for an estimated 20 million infections and 
200 000 deaths each year in resource poor regions of the world. Capsular Vi-polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines 
(Vi-conjugate vaccines) are immunogenic and can be used from infancy but there are no efficacy data for the leading 
candidate vaccine being considered for widespread use. To address this knowledge gap, we assessed the efficacy of a 
Vi-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine using an established human infection model of S Typhi.
Methods In this single-centre, randomised controlled, phase 2b study, using an established outpatient-based human 
typhoid infection model, we recruited healthy adult volunteers aged between 18 and 60 years, with no previous history of 
typhoid vaccination, infection, or prolonged residency in a typhoid-endemic region. Participants were randomly assigned 
(1:1:1) to receive a single dose of Vi-conjugate (Vi-TT), Vi-polysaccharide (Vi-PS), or control meningococcal vaccine with a 
computer-generated randomisation schedule (block size 6). Investigators and participants were masked to treatment 
allocation, and an unmasked team of nurses administered the vaccines. Following oral ingestion of S Typhi, participants 
were assessed with daily blood culture over a 2-week period and diagnosed with typhoid infection when meeting pre-
defined criteria. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants diagnosed with typhoid infection (ie, attack 
rate), defined as persistent fever of 38°C or higher for 12 h or longer or S Typhi bacteraemia, following oral challenge 
administered 1 month after Vi-vaccination (Vi-TT or Vi-PS) compared with control vaccination. Analysis was per protocol. 
This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02324751, and is ongoing.
Findings Between Aug 18, 2015, and Nov 4, 2016, 112 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned; 34 to the 
control group, 37 to the Vi-PS group, and 41 to the Vi-TT group. 103 participants completed challenge (31 in the control 
group, 35 in the Vi-PS group, and 37 in the Vi-TT group) and were included in the per-protocol population. The 
composite criteria for typhoid diagnosis was met in 24 (77%) of 31 participants in the control group, 13 (35%) of 
37 participants in the Vi-TT group, and 13 (35%) of 35 participants in the Vi-PS group to give vaccine efficacies of 54·6% 
(95% CI 26·8–71·8) for Vi-TT and 52·0% (23·2–70·0) for Vi-PS. Seroconversion was 100% in Vi-TT and 88·6% in 
Vi-PS participants, with significantly higher geometric mean titres detected 1-month post-vaccination in Vi-TT vaccinees. 
Four serious adverse events were reported during the conduct of the study, none of which were related to vaccination 
(one in the Vi-TT group and three in the Vi-PS group).
Interpretation Vi-TT is a highly immunogenic vaccine that significantly reduces typhoid fever cases when assessed 
using a stringent controlled model of typhoid infection. Vi-TT use has the potential to reduce both the burden of 
typhoid fever and associated health inequality.

Introduction
Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhi 
(S Typhi) is the leading cause of enteric fever affecting 
12·5–20·6 million people in regions of the world with 
inadequate water quality and poor sanitation,1,2 particularly 
in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Children are 
especially susceptible to infection and have a high burden 
of illness.3 Mortality is estimated at 1% and about 3% of 
individuals become chronic carriers.4,5 The large burden of 
febrile illness associated with typhoid fever in some 
affected populations—eg, 15% of children with fever 
attending a health-care facility in Nepal during one rainy 
season,6 drives widespread over-the-counter, and pre-
scription antibiotic use.7 Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is 
increasingly recognised among S Typhi lineages spreading 
from south Asia to Africa, with resistance to first-line

antibiotics (co-trimoxazole, ampicillin, and chloram-
phenicol) and fluoroquinolones, and of concern, the 
identification of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-prod-
ucing strains, contributing to treatment failure.8,9
Although control of typhoid through improved water 
quality and adequate sanitation has been shown in North 
America and Europe over the past century,10 the 
infrastructure required to prevent transmission in 
affected regions is unlikely to be realised in the short to 
medium term. Immunisation could be used in 
population-based control programmes to reduce the 
disease burden and its contribution to AMR. However, 
currently licensed typhoid vaccines are either not 
immunogenic in early childhood (parenteral Vi capsular 
polysaccharide vaccine) or are unsuitable for admin-
istration in children younger than 5 years—eg, the oral 
live attenuated typhoid vaccine, Ty21a, is unsuitable for 
use in children younger than 5 years because of its 
formulation in capsules, which are difficult for young 
children to swallow.11 By contrast, typhoid conjugate 
vaccines (TCVs), which combine the Vi-polysaccharide 
capsule 
with 
a 
protein 
carrier, 
have 
improved 
immunological properties and can be used from early 
infancy.12–14 This has been shown with a prototype TCV, 
Vi-rEPA (Vi conjugated to recombinant Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa exotoxin A), which has an estimated efficacy of 
89% from one field study of 2–5-year-olds receiving 
two doses of vaccine administered 6 weeks apart.15 
Differences in vaccine composition, including the degree 
of Vi de-O-acetylation, have been shown to affect the 
immunogenicity of different TCVs.16 In view of this, large-
scale trials to formally assess the efficacy of new TCVs, 
including Typbar-TCV the only vaccine undergoing WHO 
pre-qualification are being planned; however, results 
from these studies will not be reported for several years. 
Despite the pending results of these trials, the control of 
typhoid fever with TCVs will be considered by the WHO’s 
Strategic Advisory Group of Experts in October, 2017, and 
subsequent decisions on financing will be made by the 
Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation.
Controlled human infection models, in which healthy 
volunteers are vaccinated and then deliberately exposed 
to the pathogen of interest, have been used to support the 
development of various vaccines,17 such as the licensed 
cholera vaccine,18 and can be rapidly deployed, albeit in a 
controlled artificial setting, to assess vaccine efficacy. 
Here, we present the first data for the efficacy of a 
TCV using a controlled human infection model of 
typhoid fever.
Methods
Study design and participants
In this observer and participant-masked, randomised, 
controlled, phase 2b study, done at the Centre for Clinical 
Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine (Churchill Hospital, 
Oxford, UK), we recruited healthy adult volunteers aged 
between 18 and 60 years, with no previous history of 
typhoid vaccination, infection, or prolonged residency in 
a typhoid-endemic region. All volunteers underwent 
extensive medical screening, which included blood 
screening with baseline anti-Vi IgG assessment, and 
gallbladder ultrasound (see appendix pp 8–10 for full 
inclusion and exclusion criteria).
Written informed consent was obtained from all 
volunteers before enrolment. The study protocol was 
approved by the sponsor (University of Oxford), the South 
Central Oxford A Ethics Committee (14/SC/1427), and the 
Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency 
(Eudract 2014-002978-36). The study was done in 
accordance with the principles of the Declaration of 
Helsinki and the International Council for Harmonisation 
Good Clinical Practice guidelines.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We used the 2014 Cochrane review on typhoid vaccines in 
addition to doing a PubMed search for clinical trials using the 
search terms “Vi conjugate”, “typhoid” and “vaccine”, and 
“efficacy”, with no language restrictions up to May 28, 2017. The 
first capsular Vi-polysaccharide-protein conjugate (Vi-conjugate) 
vaccine efficacy trial, published in 2001, estimated efficacy at 
89% following two doses of a prototype Vi-rEPA vaccine 
(Vi conjugated to recombinant Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin 
A) in children aged between 2–5 years. Since then, only one other 
efficacy study assessing Vi-conjugate vaccines has been 
published. There are no efficacy trials of the Vi-tetanus toxoid 
conjugate vaccine (Vi-TT), which is currently being considered by 
WHO for licensure. The cost and logistical difficulties associated 
with undertaking large field efficacy trials has contributed to the 
paucity of published data and has hindered the advancement of 
Vi-conjugate vaccines.
Added value of this study
This is the first study to assess the efficacy of a Vi-conjugate 
vaccine using a controlled human infection model of typhoid 
fever. We have shown that this Vi-TT vaccine is safe, highly 
immunogenic, and prevents 55% of typhoid infections (defined 
as fever ≥38°C for ≥12 h or Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi 
[S Typhi] bacteraemia) and up to 87% of infections, when using 
alternative definitions of typhoid fever (fever ≥38°C followed by 
S Typhi bacteraemia). Efficacy data from this trial will help to fill a 
long existing knowledge gap regarding Vi-conjugate vaccines.
Implications of all the available evidence
Key decision makers at WHO are due to form an opinion on the 
use of Vi-conjugate vaccines in October, 2017. Findings from 
our study support the use of Vi-conjugate vaccines as they are 
efficacious and safe and will assist with controlling typhoid 
fever in high-burden settings.

Randomisation and masking
At the time of enrolment, participants were randomly 
assigned (1:1:1) to receive a single parenteral dose of 
Vi-tetanus toxoid conjugate (Vi-TT; Typbar-TCV, Bharat 
Biotech, Hyderabad, India), Vi-polysaccharide (Vi-PS; 
TYPHIM Vi, Sanofi Pasteur, Lyon, France), or control 
meningococcal ACWY-CRM conjugate vaccine (control; 
MENVEO, GlaxoSmithKline, Sovicille, Italy). Both Vi-
vaccines contained 25 µg of Vi-polysaccharide per 0·5 mL 
dose. The randomisation schedule was generated by an 
inde 
pendent statistician using a fixed block size of six 
and stratified according to baseline anti-Vi IgG titre 
to ensure participants with pre-existing detectable anti-
bodies were equally distributed between vaccine groups. 
The allocation sequence was imple 
mented using a 
random 
isation system to ensure allocation concealment.
The allocation ratio was subsequently altered to account 
for the expiry of the investigational vaccine (Vi-TT) in 
June, 2016. A sensitivity analysis was done to assess the 
effect of bias due to changing the randomisation ratio, 
specifically by analysing the primary endpoint separately 
within those participants that were randomised under 
the original allocation ratio.
Investigators and participants were masked to treat-
ment allocation, and an unmasked team of nurses 
administered the vaccines. Vaccine allocation and admin-
istration were coordinated by an unmasked team who 
were not involved in subsequent study procedures. 
Vaccines were prepared in a separate room and admin-
istered to participants with the concealment of the 
vaccine syringe to maintain participant blinding. 
Laboratory and clinical study teams remained masked to 
vaccine allocation until study unblinding.
Procedures
Following vaccination, participants completed an online 
diary for 7 days to monitor local and systemic symptoms, 
and were assessed in clinic at days 1, 3, 7, and 10.
About 1 month post-vaccination, participants were 
challenged orally with 1–5 × 10⁴ colony forming units 
(CFUs) of S Typhi Quailes strain (a wild-type strain 
originally isolated from a chronic carrier in Baltimore, 
MD, USA). Immediately before challenge administration, 
participants ingested 120 mL of sodium bicarbonate 
solution to neutralise gastric acid.19 Following challenge, 
participants were seen daily for vital sign measurement, 
blood collection, and general assessment in an outpatient 
clinic for a 2 week period, and completed an online diary 
with twice daily self-reported temperature measurements 
for 21 days, covering the 2 week challenge period and an 
additional 7 days after challenge to monitor antibiotic 
tolerability and symptom resolution.
Typhoid fever was diagnosed if pre-determined criteria 
were met: a positive blood culture with S Typhi collected 
more than 72 h post-challenge or a fever of 38ºC or 
higher persisting for 12 h or longer (participants 
were denied access to antipyretics before diagnosis). 
Diag 
nosed participants commenced a 2 week course of 
antibiotics, either ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily or 
azithromycin 500 mg daily, and attended five follow-up 
appointments to monitor disease resolution. Partici-
pants diagnosed on the basis of positive blood culture 
were com 
menced on treatment when blood cultures 
flagged positive with Gram-negative bacilli (with 
confirmatory identification of S Typhi done after 
treatment commence 
ment). Participants who did not 
develop typhoid fever despite oral challenge (un-
diagnosed) were treated with antibiotics at the end of the 
challenge period (day 14).
Outcomes
The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants 
diagnosed with typhoid infection (ie, attack rate), defined 
as persistent fever of 38°C or higher for 12 h or longer 
or S Typhi bacteraemia, following oral challenge admin-
istered 1 month after Vi-vaccination (Vi-TT or Vi-PS) 
compared with control vaccination.
Secondary safety outcomes included vaccine tolerability 
and typhoid disease severity based on severity scoring 
of solicited events within 7 days post-vaccination and 
21 days post-challenge.
Additional secondary outcomes included time to typhoid 
diagnosis, time to first fever, time to bacteraemia, and 
microbiological outcomes, such as quantitative blood 
culture and stool culture. Blood (10 mL) samples for 
culture, haematological and biochemical testing, and stool 
culture samples were processed by the local hospital’s 
accredited pathology laboratories as previously described.19 
Quantitative blood culture (10 mL) was done at the time of 
diagnosis and processed according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions (Alere, Waltham, MA, USA).
Secondary immunogenicity outcomes were post-
vaccination anti-Vi IgG titres. Serum samples were 
collected at screening, pre-vaccination, and at the time of 
challenge and stored at –80˚C. Anti-Vi IgG titres were 
measured using a commercial ELISA kit (VaccZyme, The 
Binding Site, Birmingham, UK) according to the manu-
facturer’s guidelines. Anti-Vi IgG subclass titres (IgG1, 
IgG2, and IgG3) were assessed with Vi-coated plates and 
reagents supplied by The Binding Site using a protocol 
adapted from the commercial VaccZyme assay.
Statistical analysis
Based on experience from previous typhoid challenge 
studies using the same challenge strain and conditions, 
the expected attack rate in the control group was 60–75%.19,20 
A sample size of 30 per group was calculated to 
pro 
vide 80% power to detect a protective effect of 
60%, resulting in a reduction in attack rate from 65% to 
26%, at 5% significance level (two-sided). To account 
for 15% dropout between randomisation and challenge, the 
sample size was increased to at least 35 per group. The study 
was not powered to directly compare the two Vi-vaccine 
groups with each other. The two Vi-vaccines were

considered to be distinct treatments and therefore did not 
require adjustment for multiple comparisons.
Attack rates and 95% CIs were calculated for each 
vaccine group using the per-protocol population 
(participants who completed the 14 day challenge period) 
as the pre-specified primary analysis. The difference in 
attack rate between the Vi-TT or Vi-PS and control groups 
was analysed with Pearson’s χ² test. Vaccine efficacy was 
calculated as the percentage reduction in attack rate in the 
Vi-vaccinated group (Vi-TT or Vi-PS) compared with the 
control group. Time to diagnosis, time to development of 
fever, and time to bacteraemia were summarised using 
the Kaplan-Meier method, participants were censored on 
day 14 and group comparisons were done using a log-
rank test. A post-hoc competing risk model for time to 
fever preceding a positive blood culture was fitted, in 
addition to a competing risks regression model with 
positive blood culture without fever treated as a competing 
risk. The model was fitted in Stata (version 14) using a 
maximum likelihood-based method based on Fine 
and Gray.21 Post-hoc analyses of vaccine efficacy using 
alternative diagnostic criteria were done in an attempt to 
better represent cases presenting in endemic settings (eg, 
fever with bacteraemia and fever thresholds) and were 
compared with Pearson’s χ² test or Fisher’s exact test after 
initial data analysis review.
Vaccine immunogenicity was measured by ELISA (total 
anti-Vi IgG titre) and analysed using linear regression of 
log10 transformed antibody levels, adjusted for baseline 
titres. Total anti-Vi IgG titres less than the lower limit of 
detection of 7·4 ELISA units (EU)/mL (ie, undetectable 
titres) were assigned a value of 3·7 EU/mL before log 
transformation (half the lower limit of detection). Subclass 
titres were assigned 0·78 EU/mL if they were below the 
lower limit of detection of 1·56 EU/mL. Blood quanti-
fication CFUs less than 0·1 per mL were assigned a value 
of 0·05 per mL. Antibody titre and CFU comparisons 
between groups were analysed using Mann-Whitney U 
tests. A post-hoc analysis was done to assess the relation 
between anti-Vi IgG titre at the time of challenge (28 days 
post-vaccination) and typhoid diagnosis using logistic 
regression models with the independent variable of anti-Vi 
IgG titre at the time of challenge and the outcome of 
infection (based on the pre-specified composite definition

Results
Between Aug 18, 2015, and Nov 4, 2016, 1486 participants 
were assessed for eligibility. Of the 207 volunteers who 
were screened, 112 were enrolled, randomly assigned, and 
vaccinated (73 failed to meet the eligibility criteria and 
22 declined further study participation; figure 1). 
41 participants were randomly assigned to the Vi-TT group, 
37 to the Vi-PS group, and 34 to the control group. Eight 
participants withdrew before challenge (four in the Vi-TT 
group, two in the Vi-PS group, and two in the 
control group), six withdrew consent due to changes in 
per 
sonal circumstances affecting study visit availability, 
one participant was diagnosed with inflammatory bowel 
disease (symptoms preceded study enrolment), and 
one participant was excluded due to persistently in-
creased alanine aminotransferase concentrations. Of the 
104 participants who underwent challenge, 103 were 
included in the per-protocol analysis, one participant was 
excluded due to failure to complete the challenge period 
(antibiotics were given at the participant’s request without 
a diagnosis of typhoid and before day 14 of challenge). 
Median time between vaccination and challenge was 
28 days (range 25–40).
Baseline characteristics of participants were similar 
across vaccine groups, with 29–38% of participants having 
detectable anti-Vi IgG titres (table 1), which are likely to 
have arisen as a result of natural exposure to other bacteria 
expressing a Vi capsule (eg, Citrobacter spp) or through 
cross-reactive epitopes on other organisms.
Vaccination with Vi-TT significantly reduced the number 
of typhoid fever cases compared with control vaccination. 
Using the composite primary endpoint of bacteraemia or 
persistent fever, typhoid infection was diagnosed in 
13 (35%) of 37 participants in the Vi-TT group and 24 (77%) 
of 31 in the control group (p=0·0005). The calculated 
vaccine efficacy of Vi-TT was 54·6% (95% CI 26·8–71·8; 
table 2; figure 2A). A significant reduction in typhoid fever 
cases was also observed in the Vi-PS group (attack rate 37% 
[13 of 35]; estimated vaccine efficacy 52·0% [95% CI 
23·2–70·0]; p=0·0010).
Clinical manifestations of typhoid fever seemed less 
severe among diagnosed participants following Vi-TT 
vaccination. Rates of fever of 38·0°C or higher were noted 
in six (16%) of 37 in the Vi-TT group, 17 (55%) of 31 in the 
control group, and 11 (31%) of 35 in the Vi-PS group

11·0–58·8) in the Vi-TT group, 52·2 mmol/L (23·2–74·5) 
in the Vi-PS group, and 45·6 mmol/L (27·2–91·7) in the 
control group (appendix p 6). In addition, fewer Vi-TT 
diagnosed participants reported severe symptoms when 
comparing solicited typhoid symptoms following challenge 
(three [23%] of 13 in the Vi-TT group, six [46%] of 13 in the 
Vi-PS group, and 14 [58%] of 24 in the control group; 
appendix pp 4–5).
Post-hoc analyses of alternative diagnostic criteria, such 
as fever of 38·0°C or higher preceding S Typhi 
bacteraemia, showed significant differences between the 
Vi-vaccinated and control groups (figure 2B) and resulted 
in vaccine efficacy estimates of 87·1% (95% CI 
47·2 to 96·9) for Vi-TT and 52·3% (–4·2 to 78·2) for Vi-PS 
(appendix p 1). The results remained unchanged after 
fitting a post-hoc competing risk model for time to fever 
preceding a positive blood culture, and a competing risks 
regression model with positive blood culture without fever 
treated as a competing risk.
All diagnosed participants, except for two participants in 
the Vi-PS group, had S Typhi detected from blood culture 
during the challenge period. Median time to first positive 
blood culture was 6·1 days (IQR 5·0–7·6) for the control 
group, 6·5 days (6·1–8·6) for the Vi-TT group, and 
6·1 days (5·0–10·2) for the Vi-PS group (table 2). Median 
number of S Typhi CFUs detected by quantitative blood 
culture, collected before antibiotic commencement in 
typhoid diagnosed participants, was reduced in both Vi-
vaccine groups, and significantly reduced in part 
icip 
ants in 
the Vi-TT group (median 0·075 CFU/mL [range 0·05–1·2]) 
compared with control participants (0·4 CFU/mL 
[0·05–22·7]; p=0·0476). S Typhi was detected from stool 
cultures in diagnosed and undiagnosed participants 
irrespective of vaccine assignment (table 2).
Seroconversion (≥four-fold rise in antibody titre 
28 days after vaccination) was 100% in the Vi-TT group 
and 88·6% in the Vi-PS group. Vi-TT vaccination 
induced significantly higher anti-Vi IgG titres than Vi-
PS, geometric mean titre (GMT) adjusted for baseline of 
562·9 EU/mL (95% CI 396·9–798·4) versus 140·5 EU/mL 
(91·0–216·9; p<0·0001; figure 3B; appendix p 2). 
Furthermore, significantly higher titres of all three 
measured IgG subclasses 1, 2, and 3 were induced by Vi-
TT than by Vi-PS (appendix p 2). Despite having higher 
anti-Vi IgG titres overall, no significant differences in 
titres were detected between Vi-TT diagnosed and 
undiagnosed participants for total anti-Vi IgG or IgG 
subclasses (appendix p 2; figure 3A). By contrast, anti-Vi 
IgG titres were significantly higher in undiagnosed Vi-
PS vaccinees than in diagnosed participants (mean GMT 
207·5 EU/mL [95% CI 116–372] vs 72·8 EU/mL [43–122]; 
p=0·0070), in particular, anti-Vi IgG2 subclass anti-
bodies were significantly higher in Vi-PS protected 
participants than in diagnosed participants (p=0·0295; 
appendix p 2; figure 3C).
From adjusted logistic regression, the odds of typhoid 
diagnosis were significantly lower in those participants 
with higher anti-Vi IgG titres than in participants with 
lower anti-Vi IgG titres (odds ratio [OR] 0·37 [95% CI 
0·15–0·88]; p<0·0001). The results remained similar 
without adjust 
ment for vaccine group (OR 0·35 [95% CI 
0·21–0·59]; p=0·0001; appendix p 7).
Following vaccination, five participants reported low 
grade fever less than 38·0°C: two (6%) in the control 
group, two (5%) in the Vi-PS group, and one (2%) in 
the Vi-TT group. Of the solicited post-vaccination 
symptoms, injection site pain was more commonly 
reported in the participants in the Vi-PS group 
(33 [89%]) and Vi-TT group (25 [61%]) than in the 
control group (13 [38%]; p<0·0001 and p=0·0499, 
respectively). Four serious adverse events were 
reported during the conduct of the study (one [2%] in

Discussion
This is the first clinical trial to show that immunisation 
with a Vi-TT vaccine is safe, well tolerated, and halves the 
total number of typhoid infection cases, in the context of a 
controlled human infection model of typhoid fever. While 
the calculated vaccine efficacy of 54·6% for Vi-TT is 
encouraging, it is likely that the protective effect of Vi-TT 
in endemic settings is higher. The protective effect of Vi-PS 
identified from our study was similar to Vi-TT at 52%; 
however, this is notably less than that observed in field 
trials of Vi-PS, where efficacy is estimated at 69% within 
the first year following vacci 
nation.11 This discrepancy in 
vaccine efficacy might be partly due to differences in 
participant populations, with healthy typhoid-naive adults 
enrolled in the challenge study versus pre-exposed 
individuals, including children living in endemic settings.
Historical typhoid vaccine challenge studies done by 
Woodward and colleagues22 60 years ago found that larger 
inocula of S Typhi (10⁶ or 10⁷ CFUs) produced higher 
attack rates (65%), but overwhelmed protection afforded 
by known efficacious vaccines (eg, the whole-cell 
inactivated parenteral vaccine). Because the infecting dose 
of S Typhi in endemic settings is unknown, the inoculum 
used in this study, 10⁴ CFUs, combined with the co-
administration of sodium bicarbonate buffer to increase 
susceptibility to infection through gastric acid suppression, 
probably represents a high infecting inoculum, as 
suggested by the high attack rate (77%) in the control 
group. In view of this high attack rate, it is plausible that 
vaccine-induced immunity in some Vi-vaccinees was 
overwhelmed by the large bacterial inoculum resulting in 
infection, despite the presence of Vi antibody.
The use of a composite definition of typhoid fever, to 
capture microbiological cases, and clinical presentations 
was necessary to ensure that all potential cases of infection 
were identified and treated promptly with antibiotics to 
safeguard participants. This all-encompassing definition 
of typhoid could have included participants with self-
resolving 
asymptomatic 
bacteraemias 
who 
would 
otherwise have remained undetected in field efficacy 
studies.23 As such, inclusion of these participants as 
diagnosed cases might have reduced vaccine efficacy 
estimates. The diagnostic criteria used in our model were 
not designed to mirror field trial definitions of typhoid 
fever. However, if an approximate field definition of 
typhoid fever were applied, such as fever 38·0°C or higher 
followed by bacteraemia, the estimated efficacy of Vi-TT 
would be 87·1%. Although these analyses were done post 
hoc, this definition of typhoid fever has also been used to 
estimate vaccine efficacy in a previous typhoid challenge 
study using Ty21a.20 The estimated efficacy was 80% 
(95% CI 16–95), similar to the original challenge studies 
using Ty21a, and field studies, which might suggest that 
efficacy estimates using this endpoint more accurately 
reflect the efficacy of typhoid vaccines in endemic 
settings.12,22,24 Furthermore, the estimate of 87·1% is similar 
to that found with the Vi-rEPA conjugate vaccine, which

provided 89% protection against blood-culture-positive 
typhoid fever cases in Vietnamese children aged between 
2 and 5 years receiving two vaccine doses.11,15
A further observation, which was also noted in the 
Vi-rEPA efficacy study,15 was that clinical manifestations of 
typhoid disease seemed less severe among those 
who developed typhoid fever despite Vi-TT vaccination. In 
addition, the lower blood bacterial load in these individuals 
at the time of diagnosis, when compared with control 
participants, might suggest that after ingesting a high 
bacterial inoculum, the presence of Vi-antibody reduces 
the number of invading organisms or bacterial replication 
during the incubation period, resulting in an attenuated 
disease profile. This finding has also been observed in a 
previous typhoid vaccine challenge study using a live 
attenuated oral vaccine, M01ZH09.20 A reduction in the 
severity of typhoid symptoms could lead to fewer 
undifferentiated fever presentations to pharmacies in 
high-burden settings, which would reduce inappropriate 
antibiotic use and assist with the management of the 
growing problem of S Typhi AMR.
Protection against S Typhi following Vi-vaccination is 
primarily antibody mediated.25 In the Vi-PS group, those 
participants diagnosed with typhoid had lower total anti-Vi 
IgG titres, and in particular lower IgG2 titres, the main 
subclass known to target polysaccharide antigens after 
immunisation with plain polysaccharides,26 suggesting 
that antibody quantity and perhaps the type of IgG subclass 
induced by Vi-PS vaccination play an important part in 
protecting against disease. Interestingly, no significant 
difference in titres between diagnosed and undiagnosed 
participants was identified in the Vi-TT group, suggesting 
that antibody functionality is equally important for 
protection as absolute antibody quantity. Future work 
assessing functional Vi-antibody (such as those mediating 
bactericidal, opsonophagocytic, or antibody-dependent 
cellular-cytotoxicity activity) is re 
quired to interrogate 
differences in antibody quality in protected individuals 
versus susceptible individuals.
Logistic regression modelling of the relation between 
anti-Vi IgG titre and the risk of developing typhoid disease 
suggests that higher anti-Vi IgG titres are associated with a 
lower risk of disease. Despite this, an absolute threshold of 
protection, above which individuals are 100% protected 
from disease, could not be identified from these data. This 
might be a phenomenon unique to the typhoid challenge 
model, a by-product of using a high S Typhi inoculum that 
might overwhelm vaccine-induced protection. However, it 
could also be related to the pathogenesis of typhoid disease 
and mechanisms of host evasion. S Typhi is primarily an 
intracellular bacterium that highly regulates Vi-capsule 
expression.27,28 Differences in innate or mucosal host 
responses could account for variations in susceptibility to 
infection, despite the presence of large quantities of anti-Vi 
IgG antibody, and further investigation of these responses 
is warranted. In addition, the mechanism of action of Vi 
antibody following vaccination might be related to 
lowering the infectious dose or degree of bacterial 
replication, rather than sterilising immunity at the 
mucosal surface, as indicated by experience with other 
polysaccharide-conjugate vaccines. By showing a relation 
between anti-Vi IgG titre and the risk of typhoid disease, we 
have shown that post-vaccination anti-Vi IgG titres will be 
a key component for assessing vaccine immunogenicity, 
particularly as more Vi-conjugate vaccines enter later 
stages of clinical testing. Evaluation from field trials in 
relevant endemic settings, such as those led by the Typhoid 
Vaccine Acceleration Consortium (TyVAC), will assist with 
validating these findings.
Logistical, ethical, and safety considerations in the 
study design limit the extent to which our findings can be 
extrapolated to typhoid endemic countries. Volunteers 
cannot be left untreated indefinitely, which potentially 
leads to underestimation of the attack rate. Furthermore, 
early treatment could prevent identification of self-limited 
infection and lead to an over-estimation of the clinical 
attack rate. Notably, the study population (healthy adult 
volunteers with no known previous exposure to typhoid 
infection) is not wholly representative of the populations 
where typhoid fever is endemic and Vi-TT might 
eventually be deployed. Nevertheless, immuno 
genicity in 
children immunised from 2 months of age,12 antibody 
persistence up to 8 years following vaccination,29 detection 
of higher avidity Vi-antibody,14 and boosting of antibody 
titres with re-vaccination 2 years after priming14 have all 
been shown using different TCVs in high-burden settings 
and contrast with findings for Vi-PS. Limitations of the 
currently available typhoid vaccines, in particular the 
absence of a licensed vaccine for children younger than 
2 years of age, have contributed to the poor adoption of 
typhoid immunisation programmes in endemic settings 
despite a WHO recommendation in 2008 supporting 
their use. Further efficacy data from phase 3 studies in 
this young age group, in addition to cost-effectiveness 
studies and the assessment of direct versus indirect 
protection, will support the introduction of TCVs. For 
now, the efficacy results from our challenge study can be 
combined with the growing body of immunological 
evidence supporting the use of TCVs, and can be 
considered by both key decision makers and adopting 
countries when evaluating the future use of TCVs in 
typhoid endemic regions.
Typhoid vaccine candidates have been evaluated using 
experimental human challenge studies since the 1960s22 
and have successfully supported the development of one of 
the currently licensed typhoid vaccines, Ty21a.24 60 years 
on, we have used a controlled human infection model of 
typhoid fever to show that a Vi-tetanus toxoid conjugate 
vaccine is safe, immunogenic, and prevents at least 55% of 
typhoid fever cases, though calculations of vaccine efficacy 
within the confines of a stringent challenge model are 
likely to be conservative estimates. This human challenge 
study provides further evidence to support the deployment 
of Vi-conjugate vaccines as a control measure to reduce the

burden of typhoid fever because those individuals living in 
endemic regions should not be made to wait another 
60 years.
