Abstract – The US National Honey Bee Disease Survey sampled colony pests and diseases from 2009 to 2014. We
verified the absence of Tropilaelaps spp., the Asian honey bee (Apis cerana ), and slow bee paralysis virus. Endemic
health threats were quantified, including Varroa destructor, Nosema spp., and eight honey bee viruses. Varroa
loads varied across years, with annual fall peaks; Nosema peaked January to April. Migratory beekeepers had
significantly lower Varroa prevalence (84.9 vs. 97.0 %) and loads (3.65 ± 0.28 vs. 5.99 ± 0.22) than stationary
operations, while Nosema was more prevalent (59.9 vs. 46.7 %) in migratory colonies. Since 2010, chronic bee
paralysis virus prevalence doubled annually. We detected strong positive relationships between V. destructor and
Varroa -transmitted viruses, between Nosema and Lake Sinai virus 2, and a positive relationship across several viral
pathogens of bees. The results provide a disease baseline to help identify drivers of poor bee health.

1. INTRODUCTION
Honey bees, Apis mellifera , are the third most
economically important agricultural livestock
globally after cattle and pork (Tautz 2008).
Honey bees are indispensable to the stability of
crop production and food security in the USA,
contributing $17 billion to crop quality and quan-
tity via pollination services (Calderone 2012).
Their importance to our agricultural ecosystem
was recently acknowledged with a Presidential
Memorandum creating a federal strategy to pro-
mote the health of honey bees and other pollina-
tors via a Pollinator Health Task Force (Obama
2014). Despite the importance of honey bees,
disease baselines that are standard for crop plants
as well as other livestock are not currently man-
dated for bee health. Establishing a baseline of
honey bee disease is an important first step toward
detecting and mitigating emerging biotic threats
(vanEngelsdorp et al. 2014).
In the aftermath of colony collapse disorder
(CCD) (vanEngelsdorp et al. 2007), the Animal
and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) ini-
tiated the National Honey Bee Disease Survey
(NHBDS) in the USA and territories to monitor
honey bee health and confirm the absence of
exotic honey bee pests. This survey is also

 essential to meet import and/or export require-
ments for international trade outlined by the
World Organization for Animal Health (OIE
2014). Finally, this survey allows for the estab-
lishment of an epidemiological baseline of disease
in honey bee colonies. Even with increased focus
on improving honey bee health, winter colony
losses have averaged ∼30 % over the last 8 years
(Lee et al. 2015; Spleen et al. 2013; Steinhauer
et al. 2014; vanEngelsdorp et al. 2012;
vanEngelsdorp et al. 2008) and annual hive mor-
tality approached 50 % for commercial bee-
keepers (Lee et al. 2015; Steinhauer et al. 2014).
One of the drivers for the NHBDS is surveil-
lance for three exotic pests and viruses: the intro-
duction of (1) the honey bee mite Tropilaelaps
spp., (2) the Asian honey bee Apis cerana , and (3)
slow bee paralysis virus (SBPV). These three
exotics are serious threats to honey bee health
(for details on the risks of these three threats, see
the supplementary text S1).
With surveying efforts conducted throughout
the majority of the USA, the NHBDS provides a
unique opportunity to examine and establish base-
line disease levels of common pests, parasites, and
viruses. Our random apiary sampling of both mi-
gratory and stationary beekeeping operations af-
fords the most systematic and comprehensive
view to date of disease levels throughout the year.
Previous US sampling efforts focused on deter-
mining causes of CCD (vanEngelsdorp et al.
2009) or monitored colony health in the same
operation over time (Runckel et al. 2011;
vanEngelsdorp et al. 2013b) and may have biased
sampling toward worst-case scenarios. Therefore,
in addition to the exotic threats driving this survey,
we measured incidence and levels of Varroa
destructor, Nosema spp., and a diverse set of
honey bee viruses.
1.1. Viruses
Most viruses infecting honey bees are positive-
sense single-stranded RNA viruses belonging to
the Picornavirales order. Approximately 24 virus-
es have been identified in honey bees to date, but
several of these viruses are closely related and
arguably are members of single-species complexes,
reducing the number of distinct viruses to approx-
imately 16–18 (Bailey and Ball 1991; de Miranda
et al. 2013; Ribière et al. 2008). Honey bee viruses
generally persist at low levels in honey bee popu-
lations without causing overt symptoms. However,
under certain conditions, they can become patho-
genic and widespread, leading to colony mortality.
For example, covert honey bee virus infections
often become symptomatic when their honey bee
hosts face stress (DeGrandi-Hoffman et al. 2010;
Di Prisco et al. 2013; Di Prisco et al. 2011).
Increasing virus transmission and escalating colo-
ny health problems have been closely linked to
Varroa -mediated virus transmission (Le Conte
et al. 2010; Locke et al. 2014; vanEngelsdorp
et al. 2013b). Along with the targeted species,
SBPV, our virus screening focused on two highly
prevalent species (deformed wing virus (DWV)
and black queen cell virus (BQCV)), three com-
mon dicistroviruses (ABPV, KBV, and IAPV), and
two distantly related and under-surveyed viruses
(CBPVand LSV-2), see Table I.
Varroa acts as a vector of viruses, propelling an
increased need to monitor virus prevalence. Before
Varroa , researchers could rarely attribute honey
bee health problems to virus activity, a strong
indication of a sustainable balance achieved in
the coevolution of viruses and honey bees.
Varroa provided a new infection route—the direct
injection of viruses into the hemolymph—opening
a new niche for viruses to replicate and develop
greater virulence with unpredictable consequences
(Genersch and Aubert 2010) (for more details on
why these specific honey bee viruses are of
interest, see supplementary text S2).
While time-consuming and costly, long-term
monitoring efforts such as the NHBDS provide
crucial information on the continued absence of
exotic pests, provide baseline disease levels, and
permit detection of potentially escalating
problems.
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1. Scope of survey
This effort was the result of 6 years of survey, with
the individual samples collected between August 2009
and the end of November 2014, with each survey
326
K.S. Traynor et al.
 denoted by the letters A–F (Table I). Representative
samples from states were taken throughout the beekeep-
ing season, but individual apiaries selected by apiary
inspectors were sampled only once per year and not
tracked over time. The number of states and territories
participating in each survey varied from a low of 3
(survey A in 2009–2010) to a high of 34 (survey C in
2011–2012). While most diagnostic efforts were the
same across all survey years, we replaced a two-step
RT-PCR protocol with a one-step RT-PCR protocol to
minimize the risk of cross-contamination (Table I,
Suppl. Table S1).
2.2. Sample sizes
Eight colonies of average strength (as determined by
frames of bees) per apiary were sampled in accordance
with the APHIS National Honey Bee Disease Survey
protocol from apiaries that contained a minimum of ten
colonies (Rose et al. 2014). In the apiary from a selected
operation, three different composite samples were col-
lected from eight colonies: (a) adult worker bees col-
lected in a live-bee shipping box for the analysis of
viruses; (b) adult worker bees collected in alcohol to
detect and quantify Varroa loads, Nosema spores, and
A. cerana ; and (c) a sample of brood-frame debris to
detect Tropilaelaps . In the early years of the survey
(surveys A, B, and C), the survey protocol included
sampling from 25 apiaries in each state, with twice as
many taken in CA due to the large influx of colonies for
almond pollination. In recent surveys (surveys D, E, and
F), 24 apiaries were sampled per participating state,
except in CA where 48 samples were collected.
2.3. Survey history
The first survey effort (A) was initiated in 2009 as a
pilot study in three states to field test the survey equip-
ment kits, sampling protocols, diagnostic testing, coor-
dination with state apiarists, and shipping feasibility.
The pilot was conducted in CA, FL, and HI due to
higher risks to bee health from exotic pests entering
the USA, warmer climate, long growing seasons, and
movement of honey bee colonies into CA during al-
mond pollination.
The survey expanded to 13 states in 2010 (Table II,
survey B) that included key beekeeping states and a
wide geographic distribution of the USA. Attempts
were made to include a distribution of states that

 represented queen production, honey production, and
those that had both stationary and migratory practices.
From 2011 to 2013, surveys C–F 34, 32, 32, and 21
states participated, respectively (see Table II).
2.4. Selection of apiaries to sample
Each participating state was sectioned into four
quadrants with equal numbers of apiaries randomly
chosen within a quadrant. When possible, ten queen
producers were sampled. Of the remaining sampled
apiaries, one half were from migratory operations
(move out of state and return prior to sampling) and
one half were from stationary operations (do not move
hives across state lines), both commercial- and small-
scale operations. Additional apiaries occurring near
ports or other areas that could be considered high risk
were also sampled.
2.5. Sample types
Three distinct collection methods were used by state
apiary specialists to sample each apiary. Samples were
immediately mailed to the USDA/ARS Bee Research
Laboratory in Beltsville, MD (BRL) and then subse-
quently analyzed by the University of Maryland (UMD)
or Agricultural Research Service (ARS). The first sam-
ple, used for molecular viral analysis, was a collection
of live adult bees composed of one-fourth cup of bees
(∼150 bees) that were shaken off brood frames from
each of the eight sampled colonies (∼1200 bees total).
The live bees were deposited in a live-bee shipping box
containing a water source and hard sugar candy (fon-
dant). Upon receipt, this box was immediately frozen at
−80 °C until molecular testing could be performed as
outlined below. Percent survivability was tracked for all
live bee shipments. This method has proven to be robust
and a suitable alternative to shipping bees on dry ice. In
some survey years, a very small number of live bee
samples (mean 2.5 samples, range 0–7 per survey) were
delayed in shipment and degraded badly enough that no
molecular data could be retrieved from the samples.
The second sample of bees, consisting of one-fourth
cup of bees from each of the eight sampled colonies,
originated from the same brood frames as the live bee
sample. These bees were put into 500 mL of 70 %
ethanol for preservation. This sample was analyzed for
the following: Nosema spp. spores per adult bee
(Cantwell 1970), V. destructor infestation per 100 bees
(DeJong et al. 1982; Lee et al. 2010), and Acarapis
woodi (survey years A and B only) after (Shimanuki
and Knox 2000). Since honey bee tracheal mites
(A. woodi ) were not detected in samples in 2009 nor
in 2010, samples were not subsequently analyzed for
this mite. Each sample was screened visually for
A. cerana, as the much smaller worker size is readily
discernable. These results were further confirmed by a
diagnostic genetic test for A. cerana, described below.
The third sample was taken from anything dislodged
from Bbumping^ sampled brood frames over a collec-
tion pan as described in Pettis et al. (2013b). This
sample, also preserved in 70 % ethanol, was analyzed
for the presence of the Tropilaelaps and included other
mites, beetles, and hive debris filtered from bumping the
brood frame.
As in any survey, not all respondents participate. The
return rate is calculated as the percentage of samples
received (any portion of the requested samples returned)
from the total number of kits sent out. The transit time is
calculated as the amount of time that the live-bee kits
were en route from the day that they were sampled until
they were received and frozen. The survival rate is the
percentage of bees still alive in the live-bee box at the
time that the shipment was received at the diagnostic
lab. Dead bees were discarded and only live bees frozen
for molecular analysis.
2.6. Molecular diagnostics
2.6.1. RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis
Survey years A, B, C, and D Bulk samples of 50
adult bees (stored at −80 °C) were placed in a disposable
extraction bag with 500 μL guanidine thiocyanate lysis
(GITC) buffer per bee, 25 mL total, and RNA was
extracted using the acid phenol protocol (see Sect.
4.3.3 in (Evans et al. 2013)). Following RNA extrac-
tion, DNAwas removed from the samples using DNase
I incubation at 37 °C for 1 h followed by 10 min at
75 °C. First-strand complementary DNA (cDNA) was
generated from approximately 2 μg total RNA
using a master mix containing 50 U Superscript
II (Invitrogen), random primer set (7-mer at 10-
mM concentration), 2 nmol dNTP mix, 2 nmol
polydT-18, and 0.1 nmol polydT (12–18). The
cDNA synthesis was carried out at 42 °C for
50 min followed by 15 min at 70 °C (Evans 2006).
Multiyear survey targeting disease incidence in US honey bees
329
 Survey years E and F Bulk samples of 50 adult bees
were placed in a disposable extraction bag with 200 μL
of GITC buffer per bee (see Sect. 4.2 in (Evans et al.
2013)), 10 mL total, and flash frozen with liquid nitro-
gen and homogenized using a pestle. One hundred
microliters of the grinded tissue was mixed with
600 μL RLT buffer with β-mercaptoethanol (Qiagen).
For each bulk sample, total RNA was extracted from
100 μL of the crude extract using the RNEasy™ Mini
Qiacube kit and a Qiacube™ extraction robot for auto-
mated purification (Locke et al. 2012). The quantity of
extracted RNAwas measured using the NanoDrop 8000
in nanogram per microliter and subsequently diluted to
20 ng/μL. No separate cDNA synthesis was performed
on the 2013 samples. The extracted RNA was stored at
−80 °C until processed.
2.6.2. RT-qPCR assays
Survey years A, B C, and D All composite bee
samples were screened for seven honey bee viruses
and the microsporidia Nosema ceranae and Nosema
apis (Table I, Suppl. Table S1) via real-time PCR using
Bio-Rad SsoFast™ SYBR® Green Supermix, 96-well
optical PCR plates, and a Bio-Rad CFX Connect™
thermal cycler. The single-tube PCR assays were per-
formed in 20-μL volumes containing 500 ng cDNA and
250 nM of each primer. Positive controls (purified PCR
product) and non-template controls (nuclease-free H2O)
were included in each run. The following cycling con-
ditions were used: enzyme activation at 95 °C for 30 s,
followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 5 s,
and annealing/extension 60 °C for 5 s. To check for
specificity, the amplification reaction was followed by a
melting curve analysis (reading the fluorescence at
0.5 °C increments from 60 to 95 °C to capture the
dissociation point, a diagnostic for amplicon fidelity).
Quantification by qRT-PCR of the honey bee transcript
for actin provided a measure of RNA quality and quan-
tity, allowing for the calculation of relative target loads.
Survey years E and F In these 2 years, BQCV was
replaced by LSV-2 (Runckel et al. 2011). Each sample
was also assayed for mRNA levels of the internal ref-
erence gene Rp49 rather than the more variable actin.
The amount of each virus and Rp49 in the samples was
determined by real-time RT-qPCR using Bio-Rad
iTaq™ Universal SYBR® Green One-Step Kit, 96-well
optical qPCR plates, and the Bio-Rad CFX Connect™
thermal cycler. The single-tube RT-qPCR assays were
performed in 10-μL volumes, containing 60 ng RNA,
0.2 μL (quant) of each primer, and 0.4 μL (units)
iScript. Three positive controls and one non-template
control (nuclease-free H2O) were included for each
assay. Recombinant DNA templates for each target
were used as positive controls in every run and covered
6 orders of magnitude difference in concentration.
These were used to establish the calibration curves for
quantification of the target amounts. All real-time reac-
tions (standards, unknown samples, and controls) were
performed in neighboring wells on each sample plate.
The following cycling conditions were used: 10 min at
50 °C for cDNA synthesis plus 5 min at 95 °C for
reverse transcription inactivation and Taq polymerase
activation, followed by 35 cycles of 10 s at 95 °C
denaturation and 30 s at 58 °C for extension and data
collection. The amplification reaction was followed by
melting curve analysis to determine the specificity of
the amplification products, by incubating for 60 s at
95 °C and 60 s at 55 °C and then reading the fluores-
cence at 0.5 °C increments from 55 to 95 °C.
2.6.3. Generation and analysis
of quantitative RT-PCR data
(survey years E and F)
The RT-qPCR data were first screened for the pres-
ence of specific target PCR product, as determined by
the melting curve analyses. The Cq values of all con-
firmed target amplifications were calculated by the Bio-
Rad CFX Manager™ Software version 2.1 following a
reaction baseline subtraction using the Global
Minimum Trend option and with the fluorescence
threshold set uniformly at 0.05 for all plates. All Cq
values coincided with the logarithm phase of the ampli-
fications. For each target RNA, the external dilution
standards included in every RT-qPCR run were pooled
into a single linear regression analysis of Cq value onto
log10[template]. These regression equations were then
used to estimate the absolute amounts of virus and Rp49
RNA in each reaction and to calculate the amplification
efficiencies (E ) of the different assays:
E assay = 10−1/slope (Bustin et al. 2009). For each sam-
ple, the amount of virus was normalized to the average
Rp49 levels effectively using Rp49 as a molecular
marker for the quantity and quality of the RNA sample.
330
K.S. Traynor et al.
 These values were then multiplied by the different ex-
perimental dilution factors to arrive at the estimated
number of virus genome equivalents per bee.
2.7. Diagnostic genetic screen for A. cerana
(survey years A through D)
Samples were amplified in 30-μL reactions contain-
ing 1 μL of cDNA, 1 U Taq DNA polymerase and 1×
proscribed buffer (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), 0.4 μM
each of primers that amplified the transcript for ribo-
somal protein L17 (Rp17both.F, Rp17mel448.R), and
2 mM dNTP. The following cycling parameters were
used: 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C
for 1 min, 52 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 45 s, ending with an
final extension at 72 °C for 5 min All plates contained a
no-template control, as well as A. cerana and
A. mellifera DNA-positive controls.
PCR products were subjected to digestion with AluI
(New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) in 20-μL reac-
tions containing 5-μL PCR product, 1 U AluI, and 1×
buffer NEBuffer4. Reactions were incubated for 1 h at
37 °C and then heat inactivated for 20 min at 65 °C. The
digests were separated on a 1.7 % TAE gel after which
visual inspection of cut/uncut PCR products indicated
the presence of each species, since this enzyme specif-
ically cuts the product generated for A. cerana . Control
digestions of A. cerana and A. mellifera digestions
were run on each plate for controls.
2.8. Statistics
Statistical analysis was conducted using JMP®
11.0.0 (SAS, Cary, NC). Transit time and live bee
survival were analyzed using multivariate pairwise cor-
relations. Comparisons across months, years, or inter-
actions were analyzed with multifactorial ANOVA for
transit times, live bee survival, Varroa infestation, and
Nosema spore counts. Varroa , Nosema , and viral prev-
alence (absence vs presence) was calculated, as were
95 % confidence intervals (CIs), from all samples taken
from the same apiary. Statistical analysis of virus prev-
alence included the initial pilot survey year (N = 17)
when compared across years, but these samples were
excluded when analyzed by month due to limited sam-
pling times. When the number of diseased apiaries was
≥10 and the number of inspected apiaries–diseased
apiaries was also ≥10, a normal distribution (i.e., Z
alpha = 1.96) was assumed as an appropriate
approximation of a binomial distribution (Koepsell
and Weiss 2003). In cases where these conditions were
not met, a binomial distribution (see vanEngelsdorp et
al. 2013a, b for details) was used to calculate the 95 %
CI (http://statpages.org/confint.html). Relationships be-
tween viruses were explored by calculating odds ratios
according to standard methods (vanEngelsdorp et al.
2013a). Differences in prevalence levels over time or
between groups were tested using chi-square tests or by
comparing 95 % CI; when 95 % CI of two populations
did not overlap, we considered the populations differ-
ent. Standard t tests were implemented to compare
Nosema and Varroa infestation levels between the
primary income source of a bee business (queen pro-
duction, honey, pollination, nuc production, or hobby)
with all other samples not engaged in that primary
income stream.
3. RESULTS
3.1. Return rate
For survey efforts A–D, when apiary inspectors
were paid for their collection time, return rates
remained at 95 % or above for live bee boxes
and 90 % or above for alcohol and Tropilaelaps
samples. Participation rates dropped slightly for
survey effort E but remained above 85 % for live
bees and alcohol samples. As expected, not all
samples for survey year F were received before
the end of 2014, and so, the response rate current-
ly appears low, but it is expected to increase in
2015 as in prior years (Table II).
3.2. Live bee survivorship rate
during transit
For all years, there is a significant negative
correlation between transit time and percentage
of bee viability in the live bee boxes. This varies
from a low of r = −0.48 in 2014 to a high of
r = −0.74 in 2009. When analyzed by month,
transit time and the percent received alive were
negatively correlated for all months except March.
Transit time varied significantly by month
(F 11,2894=3.88, P <0.0001). Shipments had the
greatest transit time in May (mean=5.33 days
±0.30) and the shortest transit time in October
(mean = 3.40 days ± 0.20). Bee survival during
Multiyear survey targeting disease incidence in US honey bees

 shipment also varied significantly by month
(F 11,2823=7.08, P <0.0001), with lowest survival
rates in December during the holiday shipping
season (mean=69.9 %±3.62 %) and highest in
June (mean=91.6 %±1.36 %).
3.3. Varroa and Nosema by year
Throughout survey efforts, alcohol samples
were processed for Varroa and Nosema spore
loads (N =2901). All together, 91.7 % of samples
were positive for mites, while 52.5 % were posi-
tive for Nosema spores. Varroa prevalence
( χ 5
2 = 2 3 . 5 5 , P = 0 . 0 0 0 3 ) a n d l o a d
(F 5,2895=15.31, P <0.0001) differed significant-
ly by sampling year (Table III). Nosema preva-
lence (χ 5
2=14.31, P =0.0138) and Nosema load
(F 5,2868=2.87, P =0.0138) also differed signifi-
cantly by year (Table III).
3.4. Varroa and Nosema by month
Varroa infestations demonstrate seasonal cy-
cles that typically peak in late summer and early
fall. Sample mite loads differed significantly by
month (Figure 1, F 11,2883=44.19, P <0.0001),
with September–November having mean mite
loads above 5.5 mites. From July through
November, mean mite levels were above the treat-
ment threshold of three mites per 100 bees
(Genersch et al. 2010; Giacobino et al. 2015).
However, it is only from August–November that
we find more than 50 % of samples above the
treatment threshold (three mites per 100 bees)
with a max infestation rate of 64 mites per 100
bees detected in September 2011.
Nosema loads differed significantly by month
(Figure 2, F 11,2883=26.61, P <0.0001), with only
the month of April having mean Nosema loads
above the treatment threshold of 1.0 million spores
per bee (Mussen, personal communication), sig-
nificantly higher than any other sampling time.
The highest spore count detected during the survey
was 13.95 million spores per bee in April 2011.
3.5. Nosema species
In addition to testing Nosema prevalence,
we tested Nosema species using molecular

 3.6. Migratory vs. stationary beekeepers
For all survey years, a total of 1294 respon-
dents classified their operations as either station-
ary or migratory. Of these respondents, 37.6 % of
the sampled apiaries were migratory (see
Table V). A breakdown of the disease loads in
migratory vs. stationary operations is given in
Table VI. Notably, across all samples, migratory
beekeepers had significantly lower mite preva-
lence than stationary operations (84.9 vs.
97.0 %) and lower mean mite loads (Figure 3,
3.65±0.28 vs. 5.99±0.22 Varroa per 100 bees).
Nosema showed the inverse relationship and was
significantly more prevalent (59.9 vs. 46.7 %) and
abundant (Figure 4, 0.44± 0.04 vs. 0.24± 0.03
million spores per bee) in migratory operations.
3.7. Primary income stream of bee
operation
Over all years, 2353 operations indicated the
primary type of income stream of their bee opera-
tion (honey, queen, nuc, pollination, or hobbyist).
The majority (n =1826) indicated that they had one
principal source of income, while 494 operations
indicated two business types (i.e., honey production
and pollination), and 34 indicated three (see
Table VII). Queen producers had lower Varroa
loads compared to operations that did not produce
queens for income (Suppl. Figure S2, 3.78±0.33
vs. 4.83 ± 0.13; t = 2.99, P = 0.0028), while
Nosema loads did not differ by income streams.
3.8. Viral prevalence by year
Over the entire survey period, we analyzed
viral prevalence of eight different honey bee vi-
ruses (see Tables I and IV). Mean ABPV preva-
lence varied by year (χ 5
2 = 23.38, n = 2698,
P =0.0003, see Figure 5a). Peaks of varying in-
tensity consistently occurred during the winter
months. The highest prevalence (29.4 % positive)
occurred in our first year of sampling in 2009,
when bees from only CA and HI were analyzed.
This dropped to 11.8 % positive when sampling
was increased to include 13 states in 2010. It
continued to climb in 2011 (15.8 %) and 2012
(22.9 %) and has remained steady, near 20 %
prevalence, since then (Table IV).
BQCV was only tested from 2011 to 13; mean
prevalence varied by year (Table IV,
χ 2
2 = 182.80, n = 1360, P < 0.0001). Initially
60.1 % of samples tested positive in 2011, but this
climbed to 92.0 % in 2012 and remained at 90.0 %
in 2013. Because of the high rate of prevalence,
BQCV was replaced with LSV-2 for survey
efforts E and F, samples collected in 2013 and
2014.
Mean CBPV prevalence varied by year
(Table IV, χ 2
5 =122.09, n = 2698, P < 0.0001,
see Figure 5b) and has increased steadily since it
was first detected in 2010 in 0.7 % of samples,
doubling in prevalence annually.
Mean DWV prevalence varied by year (Table IV
,
χ 2
5=55.01, n =2698, P <0.0001, see Figure 5c).
This virus showed annual peaks in late summer or
fall, with troughs in January through March or

 April. In 2009, 64.7 % of all tested bees were DWV
positive. In all subsequent years, prevalence was
above 80 % with a peak in 2012 of 92.1 %.
Mean IAPV prevalence varied by year
(Table IV, χ 2
5 =102.09, n = 2698, P < 0.0001,
see Figure 5d), with an incidence rate of 11.8 %
in 2009 that dropped steadily through 2012,
reaching a low of 4.1 %. It then surged up in
2013 to 15.94 % and climbed to 19.46 % in
2014. Prevalence showed annual peaks in
February–April during the first 2 years, with
peaks shifted to June–July in 2013 and 2014.
Mean KBV prevalence varied by year
(Table IV, χ 2
5 = 48.48, n = 2698, P < 0.0001,
see Figure 5e), with the highest levels detected
in our limited first year of sampling in 2009.
When the survey was expanded to 13 states,
the prevalence dropped to 6.45 %. It stayed
near this rate through 2012 and then jumped to
13.01 % in 2013.
SBPV was never detected throughout the sur-
vey years, confirming its absence from the USA
and territories. We adjusted our viral screens,
adding LSV-2 with survey effort E in 2013.
Mean LSV-2 prevalence varied across the 2 years
of sampling (Table IV, χ 2
1 = 19.08, n = 2698,
P < 0.0001, see Figure 6), jumping from
20.63 % in 2013 to 33.40 % in 2014.

 3.9. Interactions between factors
For interactions between factors, we excluded
our initial sampling year of 2009, as there were
only 17 samples analyzed from CA and HI, thus
not representative of a nationwide survey as in
later years. All results presented in this section
examine trends over 5 years from 2010 to 2014.
Across all years, samples that tested positive
for ABPV had more Varroa than samples that
tested negative (F 1,2549 = 31.63, P < 0.001).
Varroa loads were significantly higher in
ABPV-positive samples compared to negative
samples in 2012 and 2014, though the trend was
the same across all years except 2011. There was a
significant interaction between ABPV status and
year (see Figure 7). We detected no relationship
between ABPV and Nosema loads.
BQCV was only tested in 2011–2013. During
these years, there was no significant difference in
mite levels between BQCV-positive and BQCV-
negative bees. However, BQCV-positive bees had
higher Nosema levels than bees that tested nega-
tive across all 3 years (F 1,1335=4.62, P =0.032) .
The Nosema infection level also varied by year
(F 2,1335=4.42, P =0.012), but there was no inter-
action of these two factors (F 2,1335 = 0.73,
P =0.483).
Across all years, Varroa loads were higher in
bee samples that tested positive for DWV than
those that tested negative (Figure 8,
F 1,2549 = 61.02, P < 0.001). Each year since
2011, bees that tested positive for DWV had more
mites than those that tested negative. Sampling
year and DWV status interacted, though a similar
trend of higher mite levels in DWV-positive com-
pared to DWV-negative bees was seen in the last
4 years. In DWV-positive bees, there is a trend
toward lower mite levels in the previous 2 years;
Figure 4. Nosema spores per bee, graphed for January, 2010 through November, 2014, segregated for migratory
operations (red) and stationary operations (blue ). The y -axis was limited to 6 million spores, so a few outliers are
cutoff.

 in 2011 and 2012, positive samples had 5.63
±0.29 and 6.48±0.28 mites, respectively, signif-
icantly higher than in 2013 when positive samples
had only 4.30±0.21 mites per 100 bees. In 2014,
mite levels in DWV-positive bees fell again to a
low 3.84±0.26 mites although this drop did not
differ significantly from the previous year. DWV-
positive bees had mean Nosema spore loads of
0.35±0.019 million spores per bee, lower than the
0.57 ± 0.061 mean of DWV-negative bees
(Figure 9, F 1,2549=11.58, P <0.001).
For 2013 and 2014, when viral load was deter-
mined, there was a significant relationship be-
tween DWV viral abundance and Nosema spore
load (Figure 10, F 2,814=5.29, P =0.0052). Bees
negative for Nosema had significantly higher
DWV titers (log-transformed viral copies) than
bees positive for Nosema spores. A Pearson
product-moment correlation coefficient demon-
strated a negative correlation between Nosema
spore loads per bee and the log-transformed
DWV viral copies (r = −0.121, n = 817,
P <0.001).
In order to determine if comorbidity of two
different virus infections occurred at rates higher
than what would be expected, we calculated odds
ratios (Batstra et al. 2002) and report significant
relationships and relationships tending toward sig-
nificance (chi-square test with P < 0.1) in
Table VIII. All detected viruses had seemingly
synergistic and/or antagonistic associations
(see vanEngelsdorp et al. 2013 for details on
Figure 5. Viral prevalence from January 2010 through November 2014, means with 95 % CI error bars. Smoothed
trend curve in black .

 odds ratio interpretation) with at least one oth-
er virus, while the presence of some viruses
stood out for their apparent synergism, as their
presence was strongly associated with the
presence of other viruses. Notably, CBPV con-
sistently increased the likelihood that ABPV,
IAPV, KBV, and LSV-2 would be found in a
sample (OR of 1.58, 2.54, 2.63, and 1.90 re-
spectively), and its presence increased the
chances of finding BQCV by a substantial
OR factor of 7.28.
Starting with survey E and continuing in sur-
vey F, in years 2013 and 2014, viral load was
measured using quantitative RT-PCR. Mean viral
titers for both ABPVand DWV increased with the
level of mite infestation, while LSV-2 showed the
inverse relationship (Figure 11), with viral titers
highest in bees with the lowest mite infestation.

Smoothed trend curve in black.

error bars. Significant differences indicated, ***P < 0.0001.
Multiyear survey targeting disease incidence in US honey bees

 The more recently discovered LSV-2, added
into the viral screen in 2013, was significantly
correlated with Nosema
spore counts
(Figure 12). Bees free of Nosema had the lowest
LSV-2 prevalence and load, while bees with spore
counts above the treatment threshold of 1 million
spores per bee were 2.5× more likely to be LSV-2
positive.
Since the number of viruses screened varied
between survey years, we calculated the positive
viral infection rate (no. of positive viral tests/ no.
of viruses tested) to compare virus infection rates
across years. It varied significantly by year from
a low of 16.6 % in 2010 to a high of 31.5 % in
2012. Viral infection rate peaked in 2012, the
same year that samples experienced elevated
Varroa infestation levels (Figure 13). Viral in-
fection rate and mite load followed the same
pattern from year to year; mites per 100 bees
and virus infection were correlated across all
samples, Pearson r = 0.14, n = 2576,
P <0.0001. When samples from 2012 are ana-

 4. DISCUSSION
Longitudinal monitoring of honey bee colonies
from 2009 to 2014 confirms the absence of three
critical threats to honey bee health in the USA and
territories: (1) the rapidly reproducing
Tropilaelaps mite; (2) the Asiatic honey bee,
A. cerana , an invasive pest bee species in
Australia and the Solomon Islands and a vector
of honey bee disease and parasites; and (3) the
virus SBPV, the only virus tested that is not cur-
rently found in the USA. In addition, the NHBDS
allowed for the establishment of a baseline of
honey bee diseases, the annual cycles of honey
bee parasites, and the pervasiveness of honey bee
viruses in the USA.
Throughout the duration of the NHBDS, 41
states and two territories participated, sending
honey bee samples for V. destructor, Nosema
spp., and viral analysis. Participation rates
remained high throughout the duration of the sur-
vey, though successful respondent rate fell some-
what in the survey year when apiary inspectors
who collected the samples were no longer reim-
bursed for their time (Table II). Often, the return
rate increases during the following beekeeping
season, when inspectors mail back survey kits that
they retained from the prior year.
The mean mite load per 100 bees varied signif-
icantly from year to year from a low of 3.3±0.3 in
2014 to a high of 5.8±0.2 in 2012, but across all
years, the annual cyclical trend was consistent.
Varroa infestations were consistently low from
January through June, with mean infestations re-
maining below the recommended treatment
threshold of three mites/100 bees (Genersch
et al. 2010; Giacobino et al. 2015). Annual peaks
occurred from August through November, when
mean mite levels regularly exceeded the treatment
threshold. In the first 3 months of the year, 75 % of
all samples were below the three-mite treatment
threshold. During the months of September
through November, we consistently find samples
with 25+ mites. Such high mite levels suggest that
healthy colonies may be picking up additional
mites from colonies collapsing within the apiary’s
vicinity. National winter loss surveys indicate that
60 % of hobby beekeepers do not treat for Varroa
(Steinhauer et al. 2014). Without beekeeper
Varroa management interventions, these colonies
almost inevitably crash (Francis et al. 2013), re-
leasing abundant mites that invade healthy colo-
nies by switching from nurse bees to foragers
(Cervo et al. 2014) and swapping hosts via com-
munal foraging or robbing (Frey et al. 2011). Mite
levels peak during the critical time of year, when

 in temperate climates, colonies must rear their
winter bees to survive the coming nectar dearth
and long period of confinement. From September
through November, only 30–45 % of samples
tested were below the three-mite threshold.
Thus, more than half of all beekeepers surveyed
entered the winter with elevated mite infestations,
which have been shown to contribute significantly
to winter colony mortality (Becher et al. 2013;
Carreck et al. 2010; Francis et al. 2013; Le
Conte et al. 2010; vanEngelsdorp et al. 2012).
Nosema spore counts were more consistent than
mean Varroa infestations across survey years, with
mean spore counts dependably below 0.5 million
spores per bee, far below the treatment threshold of
1 million spores per bee. Only 2010 had signifi-
cantly lower spore counts compared to later years
(Table III), perhaps due to below-normal cold win-
ter conditions experienced in the south, southeast,
and central USA during January and February
(http://www.erh.noaa.gov/rnk/Newsletter/
Spring_2010/winter_climate_summary.html) since
N. ceranae is sensitive to low temperatures
(Forsgren and Fries 2013). The only month when
mean spore counts exceeded 1 million spores is
April, when colonies are often nutritionally stressed
coming out of winter and may be confined due to
spring rains. N. apis is exceedingly rare, appearing
in less than 2 % of samples in 2012 and 2013, while
N. ceranae steadily increased in prevalence, detect-
ed in just under one third of all samples in 2009 to a
high of almost 90 % prevalence in 2013, the last
year where we monitored for Nosema species.
Interestingly, stationary and migratory bee-
keepers varied significantly in their Nosema and
Varroa levels. Stationary beekeepers tended to have
higher mite infestations and lower Nosema spore
loads, while migratory beekeepers showed the op-
posite trend. Migratory beekeepers may be treating
more frequently to reduce Varroa populations, or
the physical movement of trucking bees for pollina-
tion may be interfering with mite reproduction.
Varroa levels were significantly elevated in bees
positive for both ABPV (Figure 7) and DWV
(Figure 8), highlighting the role of Varroa as viral
vectors (Ball and Allen 1988; Bowen-Walker et al.
1999; Mondet et al. 2014). ABPV has long been
associated with increased honey bee mortality in
mite-infested colonies (Ball and Allen 1988). The
ABPV virus replicates in adult bees and larvae,
leading to increased mortality in the presence of
mites (Brødsgaard et al. 2000). Unfortunately, due
to the difficulty and cost of tracking large numbers
of colonies over time, the survey provides a snap-
shot of disease loads in surveyed apiaries at single
time points and thus cannot address what disease
states are linked with increased colony mortality.
As in previous studies, increased mite levels
were associated with increased prevalence of
DWV (Ball and Allen 1988; Bowen-Walker et al.

K.S. Traynor et al.
 1999; Gisder et al. 2009). DWV prevalence in-
creased from a low of 64.71 % in 2009 when only
17 samples were processed from CA and HI to a
high of 92.14 % in 2012, the same year that also
had the highest mean mite levels (Table IV).
Although mean mite levels fell off after the high
of 2012, DWV prevalence remained above 80 %.
Thus, bees were DWV positive in 2013 and 2014
despite having lower mean mite levels, significantly
lower Varroa infestation levels than DWV-positive
bees in 2012 (Figure 8). This suggests that long-
term exposure to Varroa leads to persisting

 elevated DWV titers despite a temporary decrease
in mite loads. The shift toward greater viral preva-
lence at lower Varroa infestation rates may also be
influenced by a change in RNA extraction and
amplification methods (see Table S1), protocol
changes made to meet international guidelines, so
that results are comparable across studies.
In 2013 and 2014, we measured viral titers across
Varroa infestation levels. Both ABPV and DWV
varied significantly across mite infestation levels,
increasing in viral load linearly with mite levels.
Mite presence appears to be directly linked to virus
replication for these two viruses. Interestingly, LSV-
2 showed the opposite pattern, with viral load
greatest in mite-free samples and dropping signifi-
cantly as mite infestation levels increased
(Figure 11). However, LSV-2 viral prevalence and
load correlated with Nosema spore counts
(Figure 12), indicating a close relationship. As
Varroa infestation levels and Nosema spore
counts peak at opposite times of the year, it is
not surprising that LSV-2 correlates positively
with Nosema and negatively with mites. This
correlation might reflect seasonal life histories of
parasites and pathogens. Alternatively, there
might be a complex double-repressor relationship
between ABPV/DWV/Varroa and LSV-2/
Nosema. The three viruses may be competing to
use the same machinery to replicate, with ABPV
and DWVoutcompeting LSV-2. A third possibil-
ity is that LSV-2 is directly linked with Nosema ,
which in turn inhibits DWV replication. Prior
establishment in the host ventriculus by Nosema
has been shown to inhibit DWV establishment
(Doublet et al. 2015). Their results demonstrated
that prior infection by DWV did not impact N.
ceranae , while our survey results suggest that
DWV load may negatively impact the establish-
ment of Nosema, as bees free of Nosema had
significantly higher DWV load than bees infected
with Nosema (Figure 10).
The viral screens conducted suggest an escala-
tion in prevalence of several viruses over the last
5 years (Table IV). BQCV, CBPV, KBV, and
LSV-2 all increased in prevalence as did N.
ceranae . Undetected in 2009, the prevalence of
CBPV has doubled annually, a worrisome trend in
light of all the other stressors impacting honey bee
health. An increasing trend in multiple viruses and
parasites may suggest a compromised honey bee
immune system, unable to protect itself well
against a wide multitude of stressors such as a

 fragmented agricultural landscape, increased pres-
sure from pesticides, and poor nutrition (Archer et
al. 2014; Bryden et al. 2013; Higes et al. 2009;
Pettis et al. 2013a; Sanchez-Bayo and Goka 2014;
Simon-Delso et al. 2014; van der Sluijs et al.
2013), leading to increased colony mortality
(Johnson et al. 2010; Spleen et al. 2013;
Steinhauer et al. 2014; vanEngelsdorp et al.
2012; vanEngelsdorp et al. 2008). Our results also
quantify the relationships between Varroa infes-
tation and levels of a diverse set of viruses, sug-
gesting a complex, interactive relationship.
Longitudinal surveys offer a rare look at seasonal
and yearly patterns for agents that threaten honey
bee health. Results from such surveys can help
identify the causes of poor honey bee health, provide
warning signs of emergent threats, and can direct
mitigation efforts for these threats. The NHBDS
establishes the essential baseline of viral and parasite
prevalence, building a strong foundation to monitor
change and predict future issues of honey bee health.
Varroa plays an integral part in virus infection rates,
and beekeeper intervention to control escalating in-
festations must continue to be a priority. The annual
doubling of CBPV prevalence, recognized as part of
a new group of positive-strand RNA viruses and a
risk factor for colony weakness (Ribiere et al. 2010),
indicates that colony health may continue to decline
unless steps are taken to alleviate the multiple
stressors plaguing colony health. Having laid a
strong foundation for epidemiological studies, we
should continue to monitor viral and parasite loads
and tie in longitudinal studies where possible, to
determine their impacts on colony health.
