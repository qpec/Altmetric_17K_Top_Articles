Brain tumor patients commonly present with epileptic seizures. We show that tumor-
associated seizures are the consequence of impaired GABAergic inhibition due to an overall
loss of peritumoral fast spiking interneurons (FSNs) concomitant with a significantly reduced
firing rate of those that remain. The reduced firing is due to the degradation of perineuronal
nets (PNNs) that surround FSNs. We show that PNNs decrease specific membrane capa-
citance of FSNs permitting them to fire action potentials at supra-physiological frequencies.
Tumor-released proteolytic enzymes degrade PNNs, resulting in increased membrane
capacitance, reduced firing, and hence decreased GABA release. These studies uncovered a
hitherto unknown role of PNNs as an electrostatic insulator that reduces specific membrane
capacitance, functionally akin to myelin sheaths around axons, thereby permitting FSNs to
exceed physiological firing rates. Disruption of PNNs may similarly account for excitation-
inhibition imbalances in other forms of epilepsy and PNN protection through proteolytic
inhibition may provide therapeutic benefits.

eizures are common in patients with primary brain tumors
and up to 80% of patients report at least one seizure prior to
their diagnosis1. Seizures recur in about a third of these
patients and give rise to tumor-associated epilepsy, often refrac-
tory to available antiepileptic drugs2. The cellular and molecular
changes underlying tumor-associated epilepsy collectively point
to a decrease in GABAergic and increase in glutamatergic
transmission as the major contributors3–6.
The enhanced glutamatergic drive is the result of glutamate
(Glu) being assiduously released from gliomas via system Xc
transporter (SXC) encoded by the SLC7A11 gene that is upre-
gulated in about 54% of glioma patients4. The SXC transporter is
an obligated Glu-cystine antiporter that supplies cystine for the
synthesis of the cellular antioxidant glutathione7, hence making
Glu release a byproduct of the cell’s redox defense system8. By
killing neurons through Glu excitotoxicity, gliomas use glutamate
to create space for tumor expansion9 and use it as an autocrine
proinvasive signal10. Indeed, inhibition of SXC slows tumor
growth4,11 and reduces seizure frequency6 in tumor-bearing mice.
Consistent with these findings, a recent clinical study confirmed
reduced Glu release in glioma patients acutely treated with the
SXC inhibitor sulfasalazine4. Glu release, while necessary, is
insufficient to drive peritumoral epilepsy3. Rather an additional
loss of GABAergic inhibition is required with at least two sus-
pected contributors; the peritumoral brain shows ~35% reduction
in the density of fast spiking GABAergic interneurons3 and the
remaining GABAergic neurons show a significantly reduced
inhibitory potential. The latter may be secondary to a change in
the cell’s chloride (Cl−) equilibrium potential3,5 rendering GABA
currents less inhibitory.
A majority of cortical GABAergic neurons implicated in seizure
disorders are parvalbumin-expressing fast spiking (100–800 Hz)
interneurons (PV+ FSNs) comprising 40–50% of all GABAergic
neurons and are specialized in generating robust feed forward
inhibition12,13. About 80% of PV+ FSNs14 are surrounded by
perineuronal nets (PNNs) which are complex lattice-like extra-
cellular matrix (ECM) assemblies of chondroitin sulfate pro-
teoglycans (CSPGs), tenascin-R, hyaluronan and link proteins15.
Functionally, PNNs are suggested to stabilize synaptic contacts16
and possibly encode long-term memories17. PNNs may also
restrict local ionic concentration due to a high density of their
negatively charged constituent glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)18,
thereby regulating the microenvironment of FSNs and influencing
their intrinsic properties19. Importantly, enzymatic digestion of
GAGs alters the transmembrane Cl− gradient causing a depolar-
izing shift in the reversal potential of GABAAR20.
Interestingly, PNNs constituents are also substrates for matrix
degrading enzymes including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs),
a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAMs) and a disintegrin
and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTs),
which are known to be released from gliomas21, and hence may
be subject to degradation by invading tumor cells.
The current study sought to gain a better understanding of how
glioma-secreted molecules affect peritumoral neurons and the
surrounding ECM to cause tumor-associated epilepsy. Using a
clinically relevant glioma model, in which patient-derived xeno-
lines were implanted into scid mice, we show that the peritumoral
cortex (PTC) within 0.6 mm of tumor is plagued by excitotoxic
neuronal cell death particularly FSNs. Furthermore, FSNs in the
PTC show degraded PNNs caused by the proteolytic activity of
MMPs released from the tumor. We show that PNN degradation
alone is sufficient to reduce the firing frequency of FSNs thereby
decreasing inhibitory tone, implicating PNN degradation as a
major contributor to the loss of GABAergic inhibition in glioma-
associated epilepsy. Importantly, real-time digestion of PNNs
suggests that PNNs act as an insulator that decreases specific
membrane capacitance of the cell thereby permitting an increase
in the maximally achievable firing rate of FSNs.
We describe a previously overlooked role of PNNs, namely to
act as an insulator akin to the myelin sheath to reduce specific
membrane capacitance of FSNs thereby permitting supra-
physiological firing rates. These findings have profound impli-
cations that go well beyond tumor-associated epilepsy since it is
likely the case for FSNs throughout the brain and may explain the
changes in their firing properties in other diseases or following
injury where MMPs are released in the context of inflammation
and tissue reorganization.
Results
Neuronal loss and PNN disruption in the peritumoral brain.
We6 and others22 previously reported that glioma-released Glu
contributes to peritumoral seizures presumably through chronic
overactivation of neuronal Glu receptors enhancing the excitatory
drive in the cortex. Subsequently, we also showed a concomitant
decrease in the PV+ interneurons3. Given the well-established
Glu neurotoxicity for cortical neurons23, we hypothesized that
peritumoral loss of both PV+ interneurons and principle neurons
occur as a consequence of Glu release from the tumor.
To test this hypothesis, we implanted a highly epileptogenic
patient-derived glioma xenoline (GBM22)4 that avidly releases
Glu via SXC into the cortex of scid mice and evaluated the PTC
for evidence of neuronal loss using pan-specific neuronal
marker, NeuN and two specific markers for FSNs—PV and
Wisteria Floribunda Agglutinin (WFA). Since ~80% of PV+
interneurons are surrounded by PNN, which is identified
by WFA staining (WFA+), and virtually all PNN-surrounded
neurons in the cerebral cortex are FSNs14,19, both PV and WFA
were used as a marker to identify FSNs (Supplementary Fig. 1a,
b). These three markers allowed us to quantitatively examine
the overall neuronal loss as a function of distance from
the implanted tumor (identified by high density of 4′,6-
diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-labeled cell nuclei, Fig. 1a)
and the relative change in inhibitory (PV+/WFA+) to all NeuN
+ neurons. NeuN+ cells showed ~3-fold lower density in
the immediate tumor vicinity than that in contralateral
or sham-injected controls (Fig. 1a, b). The gradient of NeuN
+ cell loss was observed up to 0.6 mm from the tumor margin,
the
furthest

evaluated,
with
significantly
lower
cell density compared to sham and contralateral brains
(Fig. 1a).
In agreement with the literature24–26, ~10% of all NeuN+
neurons in cortex were PV+ (Fig. 1b, c) and showed even greater
distance-dependent decrease in density with >5-fold decrease in
the closest proximity of tumor (Fig. 1c). While it is possible for
PV expression to decrease without an actual loss of interneur-
ons27, this is not likely the case here for the following reasons: a
majority of PV+ interneurons are surrounded by PNN, which are
identified by WFA staining, yet we saw a concurrent decrease in
WFA+ cells (Fig. 1d), and did not see a decrease either in the
ratio of PV+/WFA+ or in the population of NeuN+WFA+PV−
cell types (Supplementary Fig. 1c) between tumor-implanted and
sham-injected mice as would be expected if cells survived yet only
their PV expression was altered, leading us to conclude that PV+
interneurons are significantly decreased in number in the PTC.
To investigate whether inhibitory neurons are preferentially
affected by the tumor, we compared relative densities of different
cell types independent of their overall abundance. We normalized
the cell density to that observed in sham animals and plotted
them directly comparing NeuN+, PV+, and WFA+ neurons
(Fig. 1e). These data suggest that while the cell density of all
PTC neurons was gradually decreased as approaching the tumor,

more
affected,
particularly within 0.2–0.6 mm PTC.
The gradient of PNN degradation was also observed in the
PTC as intact PNNs were only observed at >0.4 mm PTC, while
in closer proximity, the PNNs appeared damaged, fragmented,
and often limited to the cell body and no longer containing a cell
(Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 1d). A PNN degradation gradient in
the PTC was further evident by graded WFA intensities in
different peritumoral spatial bins (Fig. 2b), which also suggest
disintegration of lattice-like assembly of PNNs. We confirmed the
same by observing significant reduction in the WFA intensity
peaks (see methods) in the line profile of peritumoral PNNs, an
indicative of large holes in the PNN (Fig. 2c−e).
To question the role of glutamate in peritumoral neuronal
death, we repeated the above experiments with a patient-derived
glioma (GBM14) that does not express the SXC transporter and
consequently does not release Glu4. Consistent with Glu being
essential for peritumoral neurotoxicity, GBM14 PTC showed no
significant loss of PV+ interneurons in the >0.2 mm PTC (Fig. 3a,
b), whereas the Glu-releasing tumors (GBM22) decreased NeuN+
cells to ~50–60% within 0.2–0.6 mm PTC. Only in the immediate
PTC (0.0–0.2 mm) did both tumor types exhibit identical
neuronal cell loss. In GBM14, WFA staining showed largely
intact PNNs even in close proximity to the tumor (0.2–0.4 mm),
whereas in GBM22, PNNs were largely degraded (Fig. 3a, c).
To question whether PNN degradation by tumor is specific for
PV+ interneurons, we implanted GBM22 tumors near the
hippocampal CA2 region where dense CSPGs surround excita-
tory neurons similar to the cortical PNNs (Fig. 3d). The
interstitial matrix of the stratum radiatum near CA2 also showed
dense CSPGs (Fig. 3d). Here too, tumor degraded dense CSPGs in
the statrum pyramidale (Fig. 3d, e, compare squares) and statrum
radiatum (Fig. 3d, f, compare circles) suggesting that gliomas
degrade PNNs without any predilection for PV+ interneurons.
Taken together, these data suggest that tumor-secreted molecules,
likely Glu and proteolytic enzymes, cause a distance-dependent loss
of interneurons and degradation of PNNs, respectively.
Glioma-released proteases cause PNN degradation. Gliomas
release several ECM remodeling/degrading enzymes28 including
MMPs29, for which PNN proteoglycans are known substrates21,
and enhanced MMPs activity is also prominent in the CNS under
pathological conditions30 that present with astrogliosis. Given the
presence of reactive astrogliosis in the PTC (Fig. 4a, b), we

 peritumoral PNN degradation. However, three lines of reasoning
suggest otherwise. Firstly, while the PTC in close proximity to the
tumor (<0.3 mm) showed disintegrated PNNs surrounded by
highly reactive astrocytes (Fig. 4a (bottom square), Fig. 4b, c), we
observed essentially intact PNNs around equally high GFAP (glial
fibrillary acidic protein) expressing astrocytes in more distal
(>0.6 mm) PTC (Fig. 4a (top square), 4b, c). Secondly, PNNs are
intact in an astrocyte-specific beta integrin knockout (β1−/−)
mouse (Fig. 4d−g, Supplementary Fig. 1e), which is a genetic
model of astrogliosis and spontaneous seizures31. Thirdly, peri-
tumoral reactive astrocytes did not show detectable MMPs/gela-
tinase activity (Supplementary Fig. 2a).

 MMP-2 and MMP-9, also known as gelatinases, are correlated
with increasing malignancy in high-grade glioblastoma32; hence,
we examined their potential involvement in peritumoral PNN
degradation. We performed in situ zymography (ISZ) using
gelatinase assays in frozen brain slices to evaluate the activity of
MMP-2 and MMP-9 (DQG/gelatinase). Our data show higher
gelatinase activity in glioma-injected than in sham-treated brain
slices (Fig. 5a, b). Further, gelatinase activity was significantly
higher in glioma cells than in peritumoral cortical cells. Basal

 significantly lower than that in the PTC and glioma mass (Fig. 5b,
Supplementary Fig. 2b).
PTC exhibited a spatial gradient of higher to lower gelatinase
activity from the glioma border to the distal PTC (Fig. 5b) that
appeared negatively correlated with the WFA intensity (Fig. 5c),
suggesting the tumor as the likely source of MMPs. Corroborating
our IHC data, PNN disintegration was evident by significantly
lower WFA intensity within ~0.6 mm PTC (Fig. 5c). PTC also
exhibited reactive astrogliosis; however, an absence of gelatinase
activity in reactive astrocytes ruled them out as the primary
source of MMPs (Supplementary Fig. 2a).
If glioma-released MMPs
and/or glioma-induced MMPs
release from the CNS cells causes PNN degradation, then
blocking MMPs should rescue PNNs in glioma-injected brains.
To examine this, we treated GBM22-implanted mice with
GM6001 (Illomastat, 100 mg/kg, i.p.), a broad-spectrum inhibitor
of MMPs. Confirming our prediction, GM6001 treatment
reduced gelatinase activity within the glioma (Fig. 5a, middle
panels) and in the PTC (Fig. 5d). GM6001-treated mice showed
a higher number of PNNs in the PTC (Fig. 5e) that may be a
consequence of the preservation of PNNs which are known to
protect cells from excitotoxicity33. Indeed, GM6001-treated mice
retained structural integrity of PNNs in the PTC (Fig. 5f−i) as
evident by the presence of PNNs around cell body and proximal
dendrites (Fig. 5f, middle panels), more WFA peaks (Fig. 5g, h),
and higher WFA intensity (Fig. 5i) compared to sham-treated
mice. As PNNs protect FSNs from oxidative stress33, we suggest
that preventing PNN degradation potentially may also protect the
cells from glutamate excitotoxicity-induced oxidative stress.
These data suggest that the presence of glioma induces increased
MMPs activity that degrades peritumoral PNNs.
Biophysical changes in peritumoral neurons. Seizures originate
from the PTC, and previous studies3,5,6 show altered excitation
−inhibition balance in the PTC due to changes in glutama-
tergic and GABAergic activity. The latter activity originates
from the FSNs that express PNNs, which as we show above, are
degraded in the PTC. Since PNNs are presumed to influence
the ionic microenvironment around the FSNs18,19 and stabi-
lizes synaptic contacts34, it is plausible that PNN degradation
by glioma-released proteases may alter the physiological
properties of FSNs. To address this question, we obtained
patch-clamp recordings from neurons within ~600 µm of the
PTC, an area most affected by the tumor (Fig. 1a, e). We used
characteristic discharge patterns to distinguish between FSNs
(>100 Hz) with little or no spike adaptation35 and slower firing
(15–40 Hz)
excitatory
neurons
(Supplementary
Fig.
1f).
Recording patch pipettes also contained the green fluorescent
tracer, Lucifer yellow (LY), allowing us to identify cells post-
recording to determine their distance from the tumor and PNN
morphology on WFA staining (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b).
These biophysical characteristics and postrecording WFA
staining allowed us to unequivocally determine the specific
type of the recorded cells.
Peritumoral excitatory neurons often showed spontaneous

 in contralateral and shams. PTC neurons were also significantly
depolarized (Fig. 6a); however, their membrane capacitance (Cm)
and input resistance (Rin) remained unaffected (Fig. 6b, c). They
also showed lower firing threshold i.e., minimum current
required to elicit an action potential (Fig. 6d) and had a
significantly
higher
firing
frequency
(input−output
curve)
(Fig. 6e, f). To test the hypothesis that lower firing threshold
and the depolarized Vm of the PTC neurons were due to GBM22-
released Glu, we studied the above properties in the PTC of
GBM14-implanted mice. This indeed nullified the changes in
firing threshold and Vm with no apparent difference to sham or
contralateral brains (Fig. 6e, Supplementary Fig. 4b, c). In
addition, the spike frequency of excitatory neurons in GBM22
PTC was significantly reduced on blocking the glutamatergic
neurotransmission, further confirming them driven by glioma-
released Glu rather than intrinsic to the cell (Supplementary
Fig. 5b).
Peritumoral FSNs were similarly depolarized (Fig. 6g) but
showed significantly higher Cm (Fig. 6h). In contrast to excitatory
cells, neither resting membrane potential nor input−output curve
(Fig. 6j−l) could be attributed to the tumor-released Glu as they
were identical in neurons with disintegrated PNNs recorded in the
PTCs of GBM14 and GBM22-implanted brains (Fig. 6k). Spike
frequency in GBM22 contralateral half remained similar to sham

 (Supplementary Fig. 4e). In essence, electrophysiological attributes
of FSNs with disintegrated PNNs (Supplementary Fig. 3c) in the
PTC of GBM22 and GBM14 (Fig. 6g−l and Supplementary
Fig. 4d) were identical. Most importantly, the firing frequencies of
FSNs in both GBM22 and GBM14 PTCs were reduced by ~50%
compared to sham (Fig. 6k). This was not due to altered Vm of
FSNs in GBM22 PTC as clamping them at −60, −65, or −70 mV
did not change their firing frequency (Supplementary Fig. 5a).
Similarly, firing frequency of FSNs in sham remained unaltered at
−60, −65, or −70 mV (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Also, the highest
spike frequency sustained by FSNs was not significantly different at
any holding Vm tested (Supplementary Fig. 5a right). In addition,
there was no correlation between lowered firing frequency of FSNs
and glutamate-releasing capability of GBM14 and GBM22. This
was substantiated by observing no change in firing frequency of
FSNs in GBM22 PTC after blocking glutamatergic neurotransmis-
sion by APV and CNQX (Supplementary Fig. 5c). Therefore, FSNs
in the PTC are intrinsically less excitable than their counterparts in
the sham.
Since PNN degradation was correlated with altered FSN
properties, we predicted that blocking PNN degradation due to
glioma-released MMPs by GM6001 treatment should also retain
the biophysical properties of enclosed FSN. GM6001 treatment
did not alter Rin or threshold current but the resting Vm (Fig. 7a,
c, d). Most importantly, FSNs in GM6001-treated mice brain
slices showed profound differences in Cm and input−output
curves, and both were essentially identical to the sham (Fig. 7b, e,
f). The recorded FSNs also showed largely intact PNNs in the
PTC of GM6001-treated group compared to the nontreated
group (Supplementary Fig. 3c).

 Excitatory neurons in GM6001-treated PTC were depolarized
(Fig. 7g); however, Cm, Rin, and threshold current were identical
to their nontreated counterparts (Fig. 7h−j). Moreover, the input
−output curve showed a lower excitability with small current
injections, similar to that of sham, yet still showed somewhat
increased excitability with larger current injections than sham
(Fig. 7k, l). Note, however, that under these conditions the
elevation in glioma-released glutamate remains a driver of
heightened excitability in GM6001-treated animals.
Taken together, the peritumoral excitation−inhibition balance
is upset as excitatory neurons show a reduced activation
threshold, enhanced firing frequency, whereas GABAergic FSNs
show reduced firing frequency, and hence reduced GABA release.
Preventing PNN degradation significantly rescued the biophysical
characteristics of inhibitory neurons but without affecting
excitatory neurons, which were still under the influence of
tumor-released glutamate.
PNNs modulate firing of FSNs. The above data identified the
change in excitability of excitatory neurons as an extrinsic dif-
ference attributed to the tumor-released Glu. In contrast, changes
in the excitability of FSNs appear intrinsic, and are associated

 capacitance as the primary differences between PTC and control
cortex. If PNN disintegration was sufficient to reduce the firing
frequency of FSN, experimental PNN degradation should phe-
nocopy this in control brain slices. As our results attribute peri-
tumoral PNN degradation primarily to glioma-released MMPs
(MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-9), we used a cocktail of these
MMPs to degrade PNNs experimentally. Unfortunately, experi-
mental limitations including incubation duration and low enzy-
matic
activity
prevented
us
to
achieve
sufficient
PNN
degradation. We therefore turned to Chondroitinase ABC
(ChABC), which is a bacterial enzyme that cleaves polysaccharide
chains of N-acetylgalactosamine and glucuronic acid and effec-
tively degrades PNNs (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b).
ChABC-mediated digestion of PNNs in control cortical slices
profoundly changed the biophysical properties of FSNs (Fig. 8a)
by essentially phenocopying that of FSNs in the PTC; notably
~50% decrease in firing frequency and ~20% increase in Cm
(Fig. 8a). No other properties except Vm (Supplementary Fig. 6c)
were altered. By contrast, excitatory neurons in ChABC-treated
slices exhibited unaltered Cm (Fig. 8b) and other intrinsic
properties (Supplementary Fig. 6d), except for a small change in
firing frequency (Fig. 8b).

 The above data compare neurons in ChABC-treated to
untreated brain slices, and therefore reflect differences in
properties of FSNs with and without PNNs. To ensure that this
is reflective of individual FSN’s properties before and after acute
loss of PNNs, we also studied biophysical changes of FSNs during
acute digestion of their own PNNs. On observance of a randomly
patched cell as fast spiking (Supplementary Fig. 1f), we obtained
recordings before (T = 0) and after superfusion of 1 U/ml ChABC
(or only artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) in control) for 50
min (T = 50ChABC) at 32–33 °C. This approach reliably digested
PNNs on the exposed slice surface, yet left sufficient identifiable
traces around the recorded FSNs (Supplementary Fig. 7a, b) to
infer that the cell initially had an intact PNN.
FSNs did not change Vm either upon ChABC application or
during 50 min treatment; however, they showed occasional
spontaneous APs and 2–3 mV fluctuations in Vm (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 8a, b). FSNs with only ACSF superfusion retained the
Vm throughout recordings (Supplementary Fig. 8a, b). The Rin of
FSNs remained unaltered throughout ChABC (Fig. 8c left) and
ACSF superfusions (Fig. 8f left). However, Cm of FSNs increased
~25% on ChABC treatment (Fig. 8c middle) as evident from an
increased membrane time constant (Fig. 8d) without changing
membrane resistance (Fig. 8c left, Supplementary Fig. 8d). By
contrast, Cm of FSNs remained unaffected during ACSF super-
fusion (Fig. 8f middle, 8g). The firing frequency of individual
FSNs after ChABC superfusion (Fig. 8c right) was significantly
reduced particularly with stronger stimulation where the maximal
firing frequency was reduced by ~20% (Fig. 8e); however, it
remained unaltered on ACSF superfusion (Fig. 8f right, 8h).
Taken together, these data suggest that an intact PNN reduces
membrane capacitance and is essential to allow FSNs to sustain
their maximum firing frequency.
ChABC degrades CSPGs in the interstitial matrix and PNNs
irrespective of their structural arrangement. To decipher whether
CSPGs disintegration influences membrane properties regardless
of their structural assembly as PNNs, we measured intrinsic
properties of the excitatory neurons that lack PNNs but instead
are surrounded by interstitial matrix CSPGs before and after 50
min of ChABC treatment. Excitatory neurons gradually depolar-
ized during ChABC superfusion (Supplementary Fig. 8a, b
(right)), a phenomenon we did not study further. However, their
Rin (Supplementary Fig. 8c, left) and Cm (Supplementary Fig. 8c,
third from left) did not show any change.
PNN regulates FSN firing by modulating specific capacitance.
To
investigate
whether
the
experimentally
observed
Cm
alteration is sufficient to explain the firing frequency reduction,
we employed a computer simulation to generate a first-order
approximation to the Hodgkin−Huxley (HH) differential
equation model (Supplementary Fig. 9a, b). We entered
empirically recorded values for input resistance and specific
membrane capacitance of 1 µF/cm2. Maximal firing rate (z-axis)
increased nonlinearly with increasing stimulation (y-axis), and
decreased progressively with increasing specific membrane
capacitance (x-axis). Supplementary Fig. 9b shows a 2D
representation of the most relevant capacitance change, sug-
gesting that the observed increase in capacitance estimated
~10% decrease in firing frequency, a value close to the reported
~15–20% decrease (Fig. 8c), and supporting the suggested
causal link between the increased specific capacitance after
PNN digestion (or between PTC and contralateral) and the
decreased maximal firing frequency.
To question whether this change in specific membrane
capacitance may also affect the AP discharge pattern at lower
firing frequencies, we used Neuronify36 to model the output of
two interneurons with identical electrical properties. Reducing
specific membrane capacitance by 25%, showed ~30 and ~50%
increase in the APs numbers, upon stimulation with a random
pattern generator at 100 and 40 Hz, respectively (Supplementary
Fig. 9c). Hence, these data suggest that not only does the presence
of PNN increases maximal sustainable firing frequency, but also
the evoked activity is indeed greatly enhanced even at lower
frequencies.
PNN degradation facilitates cortical epileptiform activity.
Finally, to question whether PNN degradation is sufficient to
contribute to epileptiform activity, we compared the hyperexcit-
ability latency of excitatory neurons in control and ChABC-
pretreated slices on Mg2+ removal from the ACSF. This leads to a
gradual appearance of short (<200 ms) interictal-like events in
both current (Fig. 9a) and voltage (Fig. 9b−d) clamp recordings,
followed by delayed appearance of longer lasting (>2 s) ictal-like
discharges (Fig. 9b, e). ChABC pretreatment significantly shor-
tened the latency of ictal-like events (Fig. 9e−g) but not interictal-
like events (Fig. 9f). Moreover, excitatory neurons gradually
depolarized on ChABC superfusion (Supplementary Fig. 8a
(bottom), 8b (right)), which may likely contribute to the gen-
eration of spontaneous hyperactivity. These results support the
notion that the PNN loss is sufficient to facilitate the development
of epileptiform hyperexcitability.
Discussion
This study sought to define changes in peritumoral brain that
may contribute to seizure activity in the tumor-associated cortex.
Prior studies had already implicated the assiduous release of Glu
from the tumor as instrumental, and we indeed find that peri-
tumoral excitatory neurons are significantly depolarized, have a
reduced activation threshold and increased discharge frequency
but only when proximal to a tumor that expresses the Glu-
releasing SXC transporter. Recent studies3,5 suggested that
tumor-released Glu is necessary but not sufficient to cause sei-
zures unless paired with decreased function of GABAergic
interneurons. In agreement with prior studies, we observed a 2–5-
fold decrease in the PV interneurons density within 0.6 mm of
glutamate-releasing tumor suggesting their excitotoxic loss.
Interestingly, the surviving PV interneurons show ~50% reduc-
tion in firing frequency, a phenomenon that was independent of
the tumor-released Glu. By using WFA as a PNN marker that
enwrap PV interneurons, we unexpectedly discovered damaged
PNNs in conjunction with PV interneuron loss in the PTC. PNN
damage was found to be primarily attributed to the proteolytic
activity of glioma-released MMPs and consequently caused the
cell’s membrane capacitance to increase. Experimental digestion
of PNNs in normal brain phenocopied the change in capacitance
and the observed excitability changes. Further biophysical ana-
lysis and modeling results revealed that the PNNs must act as an
electrostatic insulator that decreases the cell’s effective membrane
capacitance and concomitantly increase the cell’s maximally
attainable firing frequency, which is directly linked to GABA
release and maintenance of inhibitory tone.
Hence, in studying glioma-associated seizures, we uncovered a
novel and hitherto unrecognized function of PNNs in the normal
brain. As illustrated in summary Supplementary Fig. 10, our data
suggest that PNN tunes cell’s membrane capacitance thereby
modulating its firing frequency. We theorize that PNN increases
the separation distance between the conducting extracellular and
intracellular fluid compartments. The constant negative charge
density of PNN’s GAGs equilibrates in physiologic electrolyte
concentrations to form nonconducting, static charges, viz., a
dielectric material. This insulating extension of the lipid bilayer

 should not affect the ionic conductance. Akin to the myelin
sheaths surrounding axons, the PNN that extends from the
proximal dendrites across the cell body to the axon hillock
increases the membrane thickness, which in turn decreases the
specific membrane capacitance.
Capacitance of biological membrane is typically considered as
standard parallel-plate capacitance, which is inversely propor-
tional to distance of the charge carriers or thickness of the
membrane. Therefore, even relatively small changes in thickness
have pronounced effect on specific membrane capacitance. The
capacitance, in turn, is a limiting factor in charging the axonal
membrane and limits the neuronal maximal attainable discharge
rate. PV interneurons are among the fastest spiking neurons and
their discharge rate appears to be the maximum of physiologically
achievable given the constraint of biological membranes and ion
channels. The maximal conduction of the Na+ and K+ channels
(G) and their absolute refractory period are constant for a given
cell. Hence the time to charge the membrane T = 1/G × C can
only be further reduced by changing the capacitance (C). This in
turn lowers the rise time of the action potential (tr = 2.2 T, from
10 to 90% of maximal amplitude). Thus, PNN appears as nature’s
trick to allow a cell to fire at supra-physiological levels without
any intrinsic changes in neuronal membrane. Indeed, PNNs
around hippocampal PV neurons may attribute their relative
higher propagation velocity of action potential with rare failure
than that of principle neurons under comparable condition37.
Although PNNs are stable structures and known to lock
synapses in place upon closure of the developmental window of
plasticity17,38,39, several CNS pathologies40, including glioma and
epilepsy, present with upregulated ECM and PNN remodeling
enzymes including MMPs. Gliomas act as a localized source of
seizure provoking Glu and PNN degrading metalloproteinases28
thereby establishing a gradient of spread, which explains the
observed gradient of excitotoxic cell loss and PNN destruction
that decreases with distance from the tumor. Reactive astroglial
cells in the PTC are also a potential source of PNN degrading
agents. However, no spatial correlation between reactive astro-
cytes and degraded PNNs suggests glioma being the primary
source of ECM remolding agents. Note that Glu may also cause
an increase in MMP expression and activity level as reported by a
recent study41. PNNs and CSPGs play crucial roles in protecting
neurons from oxidative stress33 and glutamate excitotoxicity42

 and combined actions of glioma-released proteases and Glu
might explain the selective vulnerability of PV neurons over
principle neurons in the PTC.
We suggest that other forms of epilepsies may similarly involve
a dysfunction of PNNs. Indeed a number of seizure models show
downregulation of the PNN components aggrecan, hyaluronan
and proteoglycan link protein 1 (HAPLN1) and hyaluronan
synthease-343. Moreover, consistent with our own findings,
degrading PNNs using ChABC decreases the threshold for PTZ-
induced myoclonic seizures44. In addition, depletion of brain
hyaluronic acid, which is an important constituent of PNNs, has
been shown to generate spontaneous seizures in cats45.
While we suggest a pivotal role for the MMP activity in glioma-
associated epilepsy, heightened MMP activity has also been
reported in other models of epilepsy46 with elevated MMP level
being
associated
with
epileptiform
activity47–50.
Moreover,
metalloproteinase inhibitors prevented seizures51 and MMP-9
knockout mice were less susceptible to pentylenetetrazole-
induced seizures52. Similarly, we show that the MMP inhibitor
GM6001 restores normal excitability of FSN by preventing PNN
degradation. In addition, GM6001 increased the number of FSNs
most likely due to the known neuroprotective effect of the
PNNs33 shielding FSNs from glutamate excitotoxicity33. Future
studies may therefore examine the antiepileptic potential of MMP
inhibitors using a variety of seizure models.
Our study is not the first to implicate the ECM in regulating
neuronal excitability in epilepsy; however, it does propose a novel
mechanism. Staley and colleagues demonstrated that CSPGs
digestion changes the transmembrane Cl− gradient, which can
alter GABAergic neurotransmission20. Others have suggested
altered lateral mobility of AMPAR53 or changes in the local dif-
fusion of Ca2+ in brain tissue54 following PNN degradation. The
aforementioned mechanisms could alter the excitation−inhibi-
tion balance in favor of seizures and may well contribute to a loss
of inhibition in tumor-associated cortex. Our experimental data
including recording membrane capacitance during real-time
digestion of PNNs combined with our in silico modeling stu-
dies suggest that, in the case of glioma-associated seizures, the
change in specific membrane capacitance upon destruction of the
PNNs appears to be the major factor accounting for the enhanced
seizure activity. However, it is important to recognize that in
addition to changes in the excitability of inhibitory neurons as
suggested here and by others55, PNN degradation may also alter
synaptic activity56 and hence network excitability.
Additional studies on the importance of PNN degradation are
warranted; however, our findings have therapeutic implications
concerning tumor-associated epilepsy. We propose that blocking
matrix degrading enzymes using already approved drugs that pass
the blood−brain barrier may be effective in slowing cell invasion
and tumor angiogenesis, both processes that require MMP
activity28.
In conclusion, our intention to decipher tumor-associated
epilepsy yielded a much bigger finding, namely a novel and
hitherto unknown role for PNNs. The dielectric shielding of the
membrane that reduces the effective membrane capacitance
allows FSNs to achieve supra-physiological discharge frequencies.
Other populations of FSNs in brain may be similarly modulated
by PNNs, and similarly vulnerable to enzymatic damage of PNNs
following injury and disease.
Methods
Animals. All animal procedures were approved and performed in accordance with
the ethical guidelines set by Virginia Tech Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC). Mice were maintained in groups of five in a specific
pathogen-free barrier facility in 12 h light/dark cycles. Male and female C.B.17 scid
mice aged 6–9 weeks were used for intracranial tumor implantation. Female
athymic nude mice aged 6–8 weeks were used for flank injections, maintenance and
propagation of the GBM xenografts. Astrocyte-specific β1-integrin knockout FVB-
N mice were generated as described previously31.
Patient-derived xenograft tumors. Patient-derived primary glioma tissue was
maintained by serial passage in nude mice flanks as described previously4. Briefly,
tumors were harvested after 14–18 days postinjection and glioma cells were
mechanically and enzymatically dissociated. Cells were passed through a 40 µm
filter and maintained as “gliospheres” in Dulbeccoʼs modified Eagle medium/
nutrient mixture F-12 (DMEM/F-12), supplemented with 10 mg/ml fibroblast
growth factor (FGF), 10 mg/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF), 260 mM L-gluta-
mine, 2% B-27 Supplement without vitamin A (Invitrogen), 250 µM/ml ampho-
tericin, and 50 mg/ml gentamycin (Fisher), and incubated in 10% CO2 at 37 °C.
Medium was changed daily for 2 days, then weekly. Gliospheres were maintained
in vitro for 5–7 days before intracranial injection. For intracranial injections, cells
were dissociated with Accutase (Sigma-Aldrich), counted, and then diluted in
sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to get desired cells/unit volume.
Intracranial glioma injections. Human glioblastoma GBM14 and GBM22 tumors,
previously established from human biopsies, were implanted into 6–9 weeks old
immunodeficient C.B.17 scid mice as previously described4. Briefly, mice were
anesthetized with 2–5% isoflurane and fixed to a stereotaxic apparatus (Leica
Angleone stereotaxic model 39464710) followed by a midline scalp incision and a
0.5 mm burr hole 1.0–2.0 mm lateral and 0.5–1.0 mm anterior to bregma. Patient-
derived xenograft tumor cells (2.0×105 cells in 2 μl of PBS, GBM22 and GBM14)
were injected at a depth of 2.0–2.5 mm. Control mice were injected with sterile
PBS. Body weight of animals was measured on alternate days and experiments were
conducted between 12 and 20 days post-glioma implantation. To specifically target
glioma cells to grow near dorsal hippocampus, we injected glioma intracranially at
1.25 mm lateral, 1.46 mm posterior and 1.4 mm ventral from bregma. A 10 µl
syringe (World Precision Instruments #SGE010RNS) was used to infuse glioma
cells at 11 nl/s rate.
GM6001 injections, cryofixation and in situ zymography. GM6001 or illomastat
(ApexBio Cat# A4050), a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor (Ki: 0.4 nM for MMP-1,
27 nM for MMP-3, 0.5 nM for MMP-2, 0.1 nM for MMP-8 and 0.2 nM for MMP-
9), was administered intraperitoneally as a suspension of 100 mg/kg/day in 4%
carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) in saline to a total volume of 200 µl57. Mice in the
control group received 4% CMC in saline. Injection of GM6001 or CMC (control)
was initiated 2 days after glioma implantation to let mice recover and allow glioma
to settle in brain, followed by additional injections every 24 h for total 13 days.
GM6001/CMC-treated mice were sacrificed to harvest brains for in situ zymo-
graphy on 14 days after glioma implantation. Mice were deeply anesthetized with
intraperitoneal injection with a cocktail of ketamine (100 mg/kg of body weight)
and xylazine (10 mg/kg of body weight) followed by transcardial perfusion with
ice-cold PBS for 2 min and a quick dissection of brain in ice-cold N-methyl-D-
glucamine (NMDG)-based cutting solution. To achieve rapid freezing of tissue
without forming ice crystals, we trimmed out one-fourth brain from caudal side to
decrease the tissue size. Brain tissues were immersed in tissue freezing medium
(TFM5, Electron microscopy Sciences) in a mold (4566 Tissue tek Cryomold)
followed by placing the mold on 2-propanol-filled beaker surrounded by dry ice.
The total tissue freezing time from brain mounting in TFM to its solidification did
not exceed one and half minute, which ensured the preservation of enzymatic
activity in the tissue. Sections were stored at −80 °C and moved to −20 °C for
overnight before cryo-sectioning. Coronal cryo-sections (15 µm) were cut using
cryostat (Leica CM 1850 UV) and mounted on glass slides (Superfrost plus
microslides, Cat# 48311-703). For electrophysiology experiments, GM6001-treated
mice were used (one mouse per day) from 14th day post-glioma implantation and
the remaining mice were routinely injected with GM6001 until used.
In situ gelatinolytic activity of MMP-2/9 was performed on above-mentioned
frozen sections using a commercial kit (EnzChek Gelatinase Assay kit, Molecular
Probes, Cat# E-12055). In brief, sections were thawed on ice for 30 min and
followed by 3–5 washes with PBS to remove TFM. Sections were incubated with
DQ gelatin fluorescein conjugate (20 µg/ml), at 37 °C for 1 h in a dark and humid
chamber to optimize gelatinolytic activity. Cleavage of gelatin by active tissue
MMPs exposes the fluorescein molecules (495/515 nm). Substrate concentration
was optimized for the assay and 20 µg/ml was used for all the experiments. 1,10-
phenanthroline (1 mM in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), Sigma-Aldrich) was used as
a nonspecific inhibitor of MMP (Supplementary Fig. 2c). To remove excess
fluorogenic substrate, sections were washed 3–5 times and fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 5 min. Further, sections were incubated with primary
antibody specific for astrocytes (Chicken GFAP, Cat# ab4674, Abcam, 1:1000) and
neurons (Rabbit NeuN, Cat# ABN78, Millipore, 1:500; Mouse PV, Cat# PV 235,
Swant, 1:1000), and biotinylated WFA (Vector laboratories, Cat# B-1355, 1:500) for
1 h at room temperature. Appropriate fluorophore-conjugated secondary
antibodies and Alexa Fluor® 555-conjugated streptavidin (Vector laboratories, Cat#
S32355, 1:500) were used to detect the primary antibodies and WFA, respectively.
Sections were examined and images were taken using Nikon A1 confocal
microscope within 48 h of staining procedure. Images were acquired at various

 magnifications and data were quantified using Nikon Elements analysis program
associated with Nikon A1 confocal microscope.
Acute slice electrophysiology. After cervical dislocation, mice were quickly
decapitated and brains were dissected out and kept in an ice-cold ACSF (135 mM
NMDG, 1.5 mM KCl, 1.5 mM KH2PO4, 23 mM choline bicarbonate, 25 mM D-
glucose, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 3.5 mM MgSO4; pH 7.35, 310 ± 5 mOsm) (Sigma-Aldrich)
saturated with carbogen (95% O2 + 5% CO2). Coronal slices (300 μm) were pre-
pared using Leica VT 1000P tissue slicer and slices were allowed to recover for 1 h
in ACSF (125 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 25 mM NaHCO3, 2 mM
CaCl2, 1.3 mM MgSO4, 25 mM glucose, pH 7.35, 310 ± 5 mOsm) at 32 °C. After-
wards slices were kept at room temperature until used for recordings. Individual
slices were placed in a recording chamber continuously superfused with ACSF at a
flow rate of 2 ml/min. Glioma cells grow rapidly and expand to primary motor and
somatosensory cortical areas after 12–14 days postinjection. Tumor mass in these
cortical areas was visually identified by their unique appearance as described
previously6. The pyramidal cells and FSNs in cortical layers 3–5 were identified
under an upright microscope (Leica DMLFSA) with ×40 water immersion lens and
infrared illumination. Whole-cell voltage-clamp and current-clamp recordings
were achieved using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices). Patch
pipettes of 3–5 MΩ open-tip resistance were created from standard borosilicate
capillaries (WPI, 4IN THINWALL Gl 1.5OD/1.12ID) using Narishige PP-83 and
HEKA PIP 6 vertical pipette pullers. Patch pipettes were filled with an intracellular
solution of 134 mM potassium gluconate, 1 mM KCl, 10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-
1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 2 mM adenosine 5′-triphosphate mag-
nesium salt (Mg-ATP), 0.2 mM guanosine 5′-triphosphate sodium salt (Na-GTP)
and 0.5 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA) (pH 7.4, 290–295 mOsm).
Unless otherwise stated, we added 20 µl Lucifer yellow (Sigma Cat# L0259, 20 mg/
ml stock solution in deionized water) in intracellular buffer just before the
recording for post-experiment identification of the cells. Patch pipettes were
visually guided using MM-225 micromanipulator (Sutter Instrument, Navato, CA).
A potential damage to the PNNs was minimized during the patching procedure by
applying minimum positive pressure while approaching cells. Whole-cell record-
ings were made once >5–10 GΩ seal was achieved. For voltage-clamp recordings,
the membrane potential was clamped at −70 mV. The membrane capacitance
(Cm) and series resistance were not compensated unless otherwise stated. For few
experiments, we superfused ACSF containing 50 µM D-2-amino-5-phosphonova-
lerate (D-AP-5) and 20 µM 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) to
block glutamatergic neurotransmission and confirmed the blockage by observing
disappearance of spontaneous EPSCs. Data were acquired using Clampex
10.4 software and Axon Digidata 1550A interface (Molecular Devices), filtered at 5
kHz, digitized at 10–20 kHz and analyzed using Clampfit 10.6 software (Molecular
Devices). Unless otherwise stated, during all the recordings carbogen-bubbled
ACSF was continuously superfused (2 ml/min) and all recordings were made at
32–33 °C using an inline feedback heating system (Cat# TC 324B, Warner
Instruments).
Measurement of intrinsic properties: The resting membrane potential (Vm) was
measured by setting I = 0 mode immediately after achieving whole cell. Action
potential (AP) threshold current was calculated by injecting 2−200 pA current
pulses (10 ms duration) with 2 pA increment in each step. Minimum current
required to generate first AP where onwards each subsequent higher current leads
to AP generation was noted as threshold current. Most of the cells fired APs within
this current range; however, cells that did not fire within this range were lumped in
single group of 200 pA firing threshold. To calculate input resistance (Rin), we
injected 15 hyperpolarization current steps (−100 pA each for 1000 ms) and
recorded the steady-state membrane voltage deflection (ΔV). The Rin was measured
as a ratio (ΔV/I) of steady-state change in the membrane voltage (ΔV) and the
corresponding injected current (I). Membrane capacitance (Cm) was also
calculated from the same 15 voltage responses of hyperpolarization current steps.
All 15 voltage traces were averaged and the discharging phase of voltage was fit
with a simple exponential decay and the slowest time constant was used for
calculating the Cm58. The excitability of neurons was assessed using the input
−output curve obtained by applying increasing step currents of different
magnitudes (−100 to 180 pA, 15 steps with 20 pA increment each step, step
duration 1000 ms) and counting number of APs using Clampfit 10.6 program. We
observed that the amplitudes of APs shortened as the firing frequency increased;
therefore, we set a minimum 15 mV deflection from the steady-state response as a
qualifying criterion for a spike to be identified as an AP. To check the saturating/
maximum firing frequency (AP frequency) supported by FSNs in our experimental
conditions, we kept increasing the magnitude of injected current until the firing
frequency did not increase any further with the higher currents. The observed
saturating/maximum firing frequency was found to be achieved by injecting 400
−500 pA; therefore, we capped the highest injected current to 500 pA.
Identification of FSNs with PNNs in peritumoral cortex. As evident by our
immunohistochemical staining results, disintegration of PNNs was reliably found
within ~0.5 mm of the tumor border. We randomly patched neurons within this
range and later confirmed the disintegrated status of PNN by WFA staining and
measuring the distance of the patched cell from the growing border of glioma.
(Supplementary Fig. 3a, b). We added Lucifer yellow dye in the internal patch
solution for postrecording identification to determine the structural integrity of
PNNs around the recorded cell and the distance from the tumor border. On
completion of recordings, patch pipette was carefully retracted to minimize the
membrane damage and slices were fixed in 4% PFA overnight and later stained for
WFA and DAPI to check the presence of PNNs around the patched neurons
(Supplementary Fig. 3). The slices were incubated with biotinylated WFA (1:200)
for 1.5 h followed by three rinses with PBS, and subsequently incubated for 1 h with
Alexa Fluor® 555-conjugated streptavidin (Vector laboratories, Cat# S32355,
1:200). Then, the slices were rinsed thrice with PBS, stained with DAPI for 3 min
(Cat# D1306, Life Technologies, 1:1000 diluted from 2 mg/ml stock) and mounted
on the glass slides using mounting medium (SlowFade Gold antifade reagent, Cat#
S36936, Invitrogen) and cover glasses (20 × 50-1, Cat# 12-548-5E, Fisher). The
distance of patched cell from the tumor border was also measured in the images
and only those cells falling within 500 µm of tumor border were used for analysis.
Glioma mass was identified as densely packed amorphous mass of DAPI-positive
cells (Supplementary Fig. 3).
Acute slice PNN degradation and identification of PNN+ cells. Chondroitinase
ABC (ChABC) from Proteus vulgaris (Cat# C3667, Sigma-Aldrich) was recon-
stituted in a 0.01% bovine serum albumin aqueous solution according to the
manufacturer’s instruction to make 1 U/40 µl stock solution. Aliquots of 2 U were
prepared and stored at −20 °C until used. We performed ECM/PNN degradation
by two methods depending on the experimental requirement.
For one set of experiments, we pretreated recovered slices with ChABC and
thereafter performed recordings on the ChABC-treated slices. In brief, on
completion of post-slicing recovery, 2–3 cortical half slices were incubated in 3 ml
of 0.5 U ChABC per ml of ACSF in an incubation chamber continuously supplied
with carbogen at 33 °C for 45 min. Then, the slices were rinsed with and incubated
in ACSF until used for electrophysiological recordings. These parameters of PNNs
digestion by ChABC (enzyme concentration—0.5 U/ml, incubation time—45 min,
incubation temperature—33 °C) reliably degraded PNNs but spared traces around
the FSNs thereby allowing the identification of PNN-positive cells (Supplementary
Fig. 6a, b). Similarly, previously separated contralateral halves of the ChABC-
treated slices were incubated in 3 ml of ACSF without ChABC in the incubation
chamber. Then, both the ChABC-treated and nontreated slices were kept in ACSF
together until used for the recordings.
For the second set of experiments, we performed real-time digestion of PNNs in
acute slices simultaneously with the electrophysiological recordings. We randomly
patched FSNs and recorded their intrinsic properties and subsequently monitored
their baseline membrane voltage (I = 0) for 5–10 min. The cells with resting
membrane potential unstable and greater than −60 mV were discontinued. After
baseline membrane potential recording, we superfused 1 U/ml ChABC solution for
50 min while strictly maintaining the bath temperature at 32–33 °C as it appeared
to be critical for PNN degradation. This protocol also reliably degraded PNNs but
left identifiable traces around the FSNs to confirm the presence of PNNs around
patched cells prior to the digestion (Supplementary Fig. 7). On completion of
recordings, slices were fixed in 4% PFA overnight followed by WFA staining as
described above. The FSNs expressing PNNs in the ChABC-treated slices were
identified by a low WFA intensity and disintegrated PNN around the cell body of
LY-filled cell (Supplementary Fig. 7a, ChABC) compared to their non-ChABC-
treated counterpart exhibiting intense WFA staining around the cell body and
proximal dendrites of LY-filled cell (Supplementary Fig. 7a, ACSF). The recorded
excitatory neurons appeared as the LY-filled cells with intact PNNs and high WFA
intensity background in nontreated slices (Supplementary Fig. 7b, ACSF) and as
the LY-filled cells with nearby low WFA intensity and with only identifiable traces
of PNNs in ChABC-treated slice (Supplementary Fig. 7b, ChABC).
Immunohistochemistry. Animals of different experimental groups were injected
with a mixture of ketamine and xylazine (100 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively)
and subsequently trancardialy perfused with PBS followed by 4% PFA. The brains
were dissected out and stored overnight in 4% PFA at 4 °C. Next, the brains were
transferred to PBS for 48 h and 50-µm-thick floating sections were cut using
vibratome (5100MZ, Campden instruments). The sections were either used for
IHC immediately or stored at −20 °C in a custom-made cryoprservative medium
(10% (v/v) 0.2 mM phosphate buffer, 30% (v/v) glycerol, 30% (v/v) ethylenglycol in
deionized water, pH 7.2–7.4) for later uses. To minimize procedure-related
variability, we preformed staining in a large batch of duplicate sections from 5 to 7
mice of each treatment group. The sections were retrieved from −20 °C storage,
rinsed with PBS, and permeabilized and blocked by incubating them in blocking
buffer (0.5% Triton X-100 and 10% goat serum in PBS) for 2 h at RT. Then the
sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with appropriate primary antibodies and
biotinylated WFA (Cat# B-1355, Vector Laboratories) in diluted blocking buffer
(1:3 of blocking buffer and PBS). On the next day, the sections were incubated with
appropriate secondary antibodies and Alexa Fluor® 555-conjugated streptavidin
(Cat# S32355, ThermoFisher Scientific, 1:500) in diluted blocking buffer for 2 h at
RT in dark. Further, the sections were rinsed with PBS and occasionally stained
with DAPI (10 µg/ml in PBS for 3 min) followed by two rinses with PBS. The
sections were mounted on the glass slides (Fisherfinest 25 × 25 × 1, Cat# 12-544-2)
covered with cover glass and the edges of slides were sealed with nail polish. The
antibodies used were rabbit NeuN (Cat# ABN78, Millipore, 1:500), mouse PV

Images were acquired at different magnifications using Nikon A1 confocal
microscope and quantification was performed by inbuilt NIS-Elements AR analysis
program. High-magnification images in all three panels of Figs. 2a and 4e are
snapshots of 3D volume images of 30–40-µm-thick z-stacks. Figure 5f and Sup-
plementary Figs. 1b, 3b (panel images), 3c, and 2a (top right) are snapshots of 3D
volume image of ~10-µm-thick z-stacks.
Cell counting. NeuN+, PV+ and PNN+ cells were counted from 100 µm × 100 µm
square region in ×10 magnification single plane images. In brief, a grid of 100 µm ×
100 µm boxes was drawn and the boxes containing both glioma mass and brain
parenchyma were defined as the tumor border. The number of cells in each sub-
sequent square away from the tumor border was counted and arranged with
respect to their distance from the tumor border and their cortical layer location.
Each cortical layer has characteristic density of neurons; therefore, spatial locali-
zation of glioma in a specific cortical layer(s) may affect the cell density differently.
To overcome these variations we analyzed cortical sections in which glioma was
present in all the layers and counted cells in 100 µm × 100 µm boxes in each layer in
all the comparative test groups such as peritumoral, contralateral, and sham. We
restricted the analytical comparisons to layers 3–5 due to highest density of PV/
WFA-expressing neurons. Average number of cells per 0.01 mm2 area (corre-
sponding to 100 µm × 100 µm box) for each spatial bin in a brain slice was cal-
culated by averaging the numbers of cells in 3–5 boxes. Similarly, average numbers
of cells per 0.01 mm2 area for each spatial bin were calculated from 10 to 15 brain
slices from minimum five mice (minimum two brain slices from each mouse) and
averaged to obtain mean ± SEM and the numbers of analyzed brain slices were
considered as n for statistical analysis. To compare the relative cell density of
excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the PTC and contralateral cortex, we nor-
malized them with their respective cell densities in the cortex of sham-treated mice.
Quantification of IHC and ISZ images. To evaluate the glioma-induced PNN/
interstitial matrix degradation, we quantified the IHC data of WFA intensity in
stratum pyramidale and stratum radiatum of hippocampal CA2 region and PTC.
In brief, we averaged the mean fluorescence intensities of randomly drawn 4–6
regions of interest (ROIs) of 15 µm × 15 µm area in each slice. In the PTC areas, we
placed these ROIs onto individual PNNs to overcome the potential discrepancy due
to different density of PNNs and neurons in similar dimension areas. Subsequently,
the mean intensities from 8 to 12 brain slices from minimum five mice were
averaged to obtain mean ± SEM and the numbers of analyzed brain slices were
considered as n for statistical analysis. To quantify gelatinase activity (fluorescein
intensity) and WFA intensity in the ISZ experiments, we drew concentric circles in
the PTC at every 200 µm starting from the glioma border to spatially bin the
distance-dependent effect of glioma. Next, we drew random 3–5 ROIs of 20 µm ×
20 µm dimension in each 200 µm bin area and averaged it to obtain mean intensity
which was considered as n. Mean fluorescence intensities of each area from 2 to
3 slices per animal (5–7 mice in each treatment group) were used to calculate mean
± SEM for graphical representation and statistical analysis.
Line profile intensity and PNN integrity analysis. To quantify the structural
integrity of PNNs, we acquired high-magnification (40 × 5) single plane images of
individual PNNs in different experimental groups. A polyline was drawn along the
entire periphery of cell (stained with NeuN/PV/gelatinase) with PNNs (Fig. 2c).
WFA fluorescence intensity of this line shows high intensity peaks and low
intensity drops on regular intervals representing areas covered by PNN-CSPGs and
holes in the PNNs, respectively. We set a threshold of ~50% of highest fluorescence
intensity (red two-headed arrow in Fig. 2d) and counted the number of peaks
above the threshold for 10–20 PNNs in each experimental group using Clampfit
10.6 program. A line profile intensity graph showing almost flat line with only few
low intensity peaks indicates disintegrated PNN by glioma as exemplified in
Fig. 2d. This scheme was adopted to generate data in Figs. 2e and 5h. For repre-
senting different stages of PNN and cell disintegration in the PTC in Supple-
mentary Fig. 1d, we drew a straight line across the cell in different areas of the PTC,
and the fluorescence intensities of WFA, PV, NeuN and DAPI along this line were
plotted. Different patterns of PV and NeuN intensity peaks flanked by WFA peaks
indicate whether a cell is present inside the PNN and the status of PNN.
HH modeling of PNN. We developed a first-order HH differential equation model
using Matlab. This model was first described in the seminal work by Hodgkin and
Huxley, and modified by Abbot and Kepler59,60. We used the same parameter
values as Abbot and Kepler59; resting membrane potential, VR(−65 mV); sodium
reversal potential, ENa (50 mV); potassium reversal potential, Ek(−77 mV); leak
potential, El (−54.4 mV); specific membrane capacitance, Cm (1 µF/cm2); max-
imum potassium conductance, Gk (36e−3/ohm/cm2); maximum sodium con-
ductance, GNa (120e−3/ohm/cm2); leak conductance, Gl (0.3e−3/ohm/cm2);
external applied current density, Jext (0.2e−4 A/cm2); and temperature (18.5 °C).
This similar methodology, both model interactions and parameter values, has been
used in recent studies61–63. A step size of 1 µs was used for the numerical method.
Briefly, Hodgkin and Huxley modeled the single-cell action potential using
nonlinear voltage-dependent channel resistors in series with the respective ionic
Nernst potential to charge a parallel membrane capacitor. This circuit model
results in the following differential equation:

The initial condition for all simulations was: (Vr, n(0), m(0), h(0)) = (−65 mV,
0.3177, 0.0529, 0.5961).
Each simulation sampled from a (capacitance, external current) space. The
capacitance ranged from 0.8 to 1.5 µF/cm2 with a step size of 0.01 µF/cm2; the
external current ranged from 0.2−4 to 1.4−2. The firing frequency as a function of
capacitance and external current was calculated by using Matlab’s findpeaks
function on the voltage time series output for each simulation. Firing frequency
was calculated as the number of peaks >20 mV in the 1000 ms simulation.
Statistical analysis. Data are represented as box and whisker plots unless other-
wise stated in the specific figures. The central lines and plus signs within box and
whisker plot represent the medians and means, respectively; the two ends of the
rectangles represent first and third quartiles. The upper and lower whiskers extend
to the highest and lowest values in the data set, respectively. Individual data points
are represented by dots. Statistical details of experiments are mentioned in the
figure legends and all the details of statistical analysis including test statistics, P
values, post-hoc comparisons, and 95% confidence intervals of mean differences
are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. Data are sufficiently normal distributed
and variance within groups is sufficiently similar to be used for parametric tests.
Experimental designs with two treatment groups were analyzed by two-tailed
unpaired or paired t test. Welch’s correction was applied where variances of both
the groups were statistically different. Experimental designs with more than two
groups were analyzed using one-way ANOVA or two-way ANOVA followed by
Tukey’s or Sidak’s post-hoc multiple comparison tests. Statistically significant
difference between groups were notified in graphs using asterisk(s) (*P < 0.05, **P
< 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001) and occasionally number sign (#P < 0.05, ##P
< 0.01, ###P < 0.001, ####P < 0.0001). Data analysis was performed using Graph-
Pad Prism 7.0, Microsoft Excel, and Origin 2016 (OriginLab).
