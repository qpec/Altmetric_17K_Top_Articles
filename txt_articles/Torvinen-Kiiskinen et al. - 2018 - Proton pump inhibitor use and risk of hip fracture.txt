Summary 
Background: Hip fractures are a major health concern among older persons with Alzheimer’s 
disease, who usually use many concomitant drugs for several diseases. Evidence of the association 
between proton pump inhibitor use and risk of hip fracture is contradictory. 
Aim: To investigate whether the long-term use of proton pump inhibitor is associated with risk of 
hip fractures among community-dwelling persons with Alzheimer’s disease.  
Methods: In this nested case-control study, the nationwide MEDALZ data was utilized.  Community-
dwelling persons with Alzheimer’s disease who encountered incident hip fracture (N=4,818; mean 
age 84.1) were included as cases. Four controls were matched for each case at the date of hip 
fracture (N=19,235; mean age 84.0). The association between hip fracture and duration of current 
PPI use (ongoing use during 0-30 days before the index date), and cumulative duration of use during 
10 years before was investigated with conditional logistic regression. 
Results: Long-term or cumulative proton pump inhibitor use were not associated with an increased 
risk of hip fracture. Current proton pump inhibitor use was associated with an increased risk of hip 
fracture (adjusted OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.03–1.22). The risk was increased in short-term current use (<1 
year) (adjusted OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.10–1.37).  
Conclusions: The increased risk of hip fracture was evident only in short-term proton pump inhibitor 
use, but no association was found for long-term or cumulative use. Thus, our findings do not support 
previous assumptions that long-term proton pump inhibitor use would be associated with an 
increased risk of hip fractures.

Introduction 
Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly and increasingly used among older population1-3, even 
though they have been associated with several serious adverse events, such as fractures and 
pneumonia.4-6 Indications for PPI use among older persons are dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux 
disease and peptic ulcer, but due to gastro-protective properties they are also co-prescribed with 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids.7,8  
Hip fractures are a major health concern among older persons with Alzheimer’s disease, and 
Alzheimer’s disease itself seems to be a risk factor for falling, and consequently, hip fractures.9,10 In 
addition, older persons with Alzheimer’s disease usually use many concomitant drugs for several 
diseases, which both are fall risk increasing factors.11  
Association between PPI use and risk of fractures remains unclear. Several previous studies have 
found association between PPI use and an increased risk of hip fracture 12-16 but there are also 
studies which did not find an association. 17–19 According to a novel meta-analysis, the risk seems to 
be modestly increased (RR=1.26; 95% CI 1.16–1.36), albeit the studies are heterogeneous.6 It has 
been supposed that PPI use lead to bone loss and fractures by reducing calcium absorption.18 
However, some studies have reported that PPI use has no effects on bone structure.20-22 Other 
mechanisms suggested are myopathy23 or vitamin B12 deficiency24 leading to injurious falls and 
fractures.25 To our knowledge, no previous study has investigated whether current use, duration of 
current use, past use or cumulative PPI use are associated with risk of hip fracture among persons 
with Alzheimer’s disease. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate whether there is an 
association between long-term PPI use and risk of hip fractures among community-dwelling persons 
with clinically verified diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease.

Materials and methods 
Data source 
In this study, the nationwide register-based MEDALZ (Medication use and Alzheimer’s disease) data 
was utilized. It consists of all community-dwelling persons who received clinically verified diagnosis 
of Alzheimer’s disease between 2005 and 2011 (N=70,718), and has been previously described in 
detail.26 Diagnoses of Alzheimer’s disease were recorded in the Special Reimbursement Register and 
were based on National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the 
Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association27 and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders, 4th Edition criteria.28 The verified Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis requires 
computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scan and confirmation of the diagnosis by a 
neurologist or geriatrician. MEDALZ-data contains information from several nationwide registers 
including the Prescription Register (years 1995–2012), the Special Reimbursement Register (1972–
2012), the Hospital Discharge Register (1972–2012) and socioeconomic data from the Statistics 
Finland (1972–2012). All registers are linked by Personal Identification Numbers which have been 
assigned to all residents. However, data was de-identified before submission to researchers. 
Study population  
This study was restricted to persons with incident hip fracture. Persons with a hip fracture before 
the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (n=3,714) were excluded (Figure 1), because it is difficult to 
separate the treatment of previous hip fracture from the new event in the Hospital Discharge 
Register. After exclusion, our study sample included 4,818 cases with an incident hip fracture. For 
each hip fracture -case, up to four controls without hip fracture (N=19,235) were matched at the 
date of hip fracture with incidence density sampling. Controls were matched by time since diagnoses 
 5 
 
of Alzheimer’s disease (±90 days), age (±2 years) and sex, at the date of hip fracture. The index date 
was considered as the date of hip fracture for cases and corresponding matching date for controls.  
Hip fractures were identified from Hospital Discharge register based on ICD-10 codes S72.0 (fracture 
of neck of femur), S72.1 (pertrochanteric fracture) and S72.2 (subtrochanteric fracture). For 
previous hip fractures, corresponding ICD-8 and ICD-9 codes were utilized.  
Drug exposure  
Drug use was defined from Prescription Register, which contains all reimbursed drug purchases from 
community pharmacies in Finland. During hospital stay, drugs are provided by the caring unit and 
are not recorded in the Prescription Register. In addition, Over the Counter drugs are not recorded 
and small packages (up to 14 tablets) of omeprazole, esomeprazole, pantoprazole and lansoprazole 
have been available as  Over the Counter drugs since the year 2010 in Finland.29 PRE2DUP 
(Prescriptions to drug use periods) method was utilized to construct drug use periods according to 
individual purchasing style and was based on the calculation of sliding averages of daily dose.30 The 
method takes into account purchase regularity, stockpiling of drugs and possible hospitalizations, 
and has been validated against information from self-reported drug use in interview, and by expert 
opinion.31,32 All reimbursed drugs (based on Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification, ATC 
codes) were modelled.33 The result of the PRE2DUP modelling are drug use periods which describe 
when continuous drug use started and ended, for each participant and for each ATC code.30 
PPI use was defined as use of ATC code A02BC, including omeprazole, pantoprazole, lansoprazole, 
rabeprazole and esomeprazole (ATC codes A02BC01, A02BC02, A02BC03, A02BC04 and A02BC05, 
respectively). In subanalysis of drug substance, we defined use of PPI at the index date, and excluded 
30 PPI users (5 of cases and 25 of controls), who used two or more different PPI drug substance 
concomitantly. Use of antidepressants was defined as use of ATC class N06A, antipsychotics as N05A 
(excluding prochlorperazine N05AB04 and lithium N05AN01), opioids as N02A, benzodiazepines and 
 6 
 
related drug as N05BA, N05CD or N05CF, acetylcholine esterase inhibitors as N06DA and memantine 
as N06DX01.  Use of these drugs was defined 30 days before the index date. Drug exposure to H2-
receptor antagonists was defined as use of A02BA, bisphosphonates as M05BA or M05BB, oral 
corticosteroids as H02AB and antithrombotic agents as B01A, which were defined since 1995 until 
the index date. Thus, also short-term treatments, such as oral corticosteroids for asthma 
exacerbation, were counted. 
We defined PPI users as “current users” if the PPI use period was ongoing 0-30 days before the index 
date, “past users” if the PPI use period was ongoing 31-90 days before (but not 0-30 days before) 
the index date and “ever users” if PPIs were used during 10 years before the index date. For duration 
of use, we retrieved “any PPI use” by combining overlapping PPI use periods. Duration of current 
use was determined for drug use periods which were ongoing at the 0-30 days before the index 
date, i.e. duration of use in days of the last PPI use period. Long-term use was defined as ≥1 year of 
current use. Cumulative use was calculated during 10 years observation period by summing up 
durations of all drug use periods during the follow-up among “ever users”. Duration of use was 
categorized into classes according to duration in years. 
Covariates 
Study participants’ age and sex were obtained from the Social Insurance Institution. Cardiovascular 
disease was defined as chronic heart failure, arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease or 
chronic arrhythmia. Other comorbidities were diabetes, asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, rheumatoid arthritis and disseminated connective tissue diseases, epilepsy, glaucoma, 
breast cancer, prostatic cancer, gynecologic cancer, leukemia, and other malignant tumor. 
Comorbidities were based on Special Reimbursement Register and defined since 1972 until the 
index date. 
 7 
 
History of diseases were based on Hospital Discharge Register since 1972 until the index date. 
Previous fracture was defined as ICD-10 codes: S*2 or T02 (any fracture) and limited to 10 years 
before index date. Substance abuse was defined as diagnoses of alcohol-induced chronic 
pancreatitis (ICD-10-code K860), mental and behavioral disorders due to psychoactive substance 
use (ICD10-codes F10-19) or substance abuse as reason for hospital admission before the date of 
Alzheimer’s disease diagnoses. Stroke was defined as ICD-10 codes I60-I64. History of schizophrenia, 
bipolar disorder and depression were defined as ICD-10 codes (schizophrenia, schizotypal or 
delusional disorders F20-29; manic episode: F30; bipolar disorder: F31; depression: F32-34, F38-39) 
at least 5 years before the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease.34 Corresponding diagnoses were defined 
according to ICD-codes 8 and 9. Hospital days were based on Hospital Discharge Register and 
investigated 10 years before the index date and divided to <90 days and ≥90 days at hospital during 
the follow-up. 
Occupational socioeconomic position was defined based on data from Statistics Finland and divided 
into four classes, where the lowest position included unemployed persons and students; medium 
class included employees and lowest clerical workers; the highest class included highest clerical 
workers and entrepreneurs and fourth class was unknown. We considered the highest position 
recorded for a person at the age of 45–55.  
Statistical analysis 
Conditional logistic regression model (by taking into account the matched design) was used to 
investigate whether current, past, or cumulative drug use were associated with risk of hip fracture. 
In all analyses, nonuse of PPIs was used as a reference. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, 
socioeconomic position, ≥90 hospital days during the follow-up, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, 
asthma/COPD, glaucoma, rheumatoid arthritis, epilepsy; previous fracture, stroke, cancer, 
 8 
 
depression or bipolar syndrome, schizophrenia, substance abuse; use of acetylcholine esterase 
inhibitors, memantine, oral corticosteroids, bisphosphonates, antipsychotics, antidepressants, 
benzodiazepines and related drugs, opioids, antithrombotics and H2-blockers. Covariates for 
adjustment, drugs and comorbidities associated with PPI use and hip fracture, were chosen based 
on literature.1, 11, 35-37 The results are reported as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) 
and p-values. As an additional analysis, differences between current PPI users and non-users were 
investigated. All analyses were performed using SAS statistical software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, 
Inc., Cary, NC). 
According to Finnish legislation, an approval from ethics committee was not needed, because the 
study persons stayed unidentified and were not contacted. 
Results 
Mean age of cases was 84.1 (SD 6.0) and controls 84.0 (SD 5.8) years, and most of the study 
population (75%) were women (Table 1). Previous fracture was more common among cases (35%) 
compared to controls (20%). Cases were more commonly using antipsychotics, antidepressants, 
opioids and benzodiazepines and related drugs compared with controls. Acetylcholine esterase 
inhibitors were more commonly used by controls than cases. Mean time since Alzheimer’s disease 
diagnoses to index date was 849 (SD 611) days in cases and 847 (SD 612) days in controls. 
Almost half of the cases (2,321; 48%) and controls (9,066; 47%) had used PPI during 10 years before 
the index date (Table 2).  Cumulative use was not associated with an increased risk for hip fracture 
compared to non-users in the adjusted model. Current PPI users comprised 20% (973) of the cases 
and 17% (3,274) of the controls. Current PPI use was associated with an increased risk of hip fracture 
(adjusted OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.03–1.22) whereas past use of PPI was not. For duration of current use, 
 9 
 
the risk was increased only in short-term use (<1 year) (adjusted OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.10–1.37). Current 
use over one year was not associated with risk of hip fracture after adjusting for confounders.  
Pantoprazole was the most commonly used PPI at the index date (Table 3). There were no significant 
differences between PPI drug substances and associated risk of hip fracture after adjusting for 
confounders. 
Among current users of PPI (N=4,247), 79% were women compared to 75% of those who did not 
currently use PPI (N=19,806). Cardiovascular diseases were more common among current PPI users 
(59%) than non-users (51%). Current PPI users used oral corticosteroids (34%), bisphosphonate 
(27%), antidepressants (39%), benzodiazepines and related drugs (36%), opioids (13%) and H2-
blockers (34%) more frequently than non-users of PPI (among non-users prevalences were 20%, 
16%, 22%, 23%, 5% and 18%, respectively). 
Discussion 
Long-term or cumulative PPI use was not associated with risk of hip fracture among community-
dwelling persons with Alzheimer’s disease. Current PPI use was modestly associated with an 
increased risk of hip fracture. While the risk was evident in short-term current use, no association 
was found for longer duration of use. No differences were found in risk of hip fracture between drug 
substances. 
Possible mechanism for the association between PPIs and fractures is still unclear.38 Our results do 
not support the previous hypothesis that long-term PPI use would increase the risk of hip fracture 
by bone loss due to decreased calcium absorption39, because the increased risk was not found in 
long-term PPI use. Duration of current use was assessed in one-year categories until 4 years of use 
and duration of cumulative use until 10 years. Furthermore, it is unlikely that other suggested 
mechanisms for association, such as hypomagnesaemia, myopathy and vitamin B12 deficiency, 
 10 
 
could increase the fracture risk during less than one year of use.23-25,38,40 Additionally, the evidence 
of these mechanisms is contradictory.17,20  
Our results are in contrast with two studies that found an increased risk of hip fracture in long-term 
use.17,25 A study of Targownik et al. was conducted among persons aged 50 years or older and found 
an increased risk only for over 5 years of PPI use.17 Study population of Lewis et al. were women, 
and the main finding was the increased risk in long-term (≥1 year) use.25 Contrary to the previous 
studies reporting risk estimates varying 1.30–2.11 for hip fracture and cumulative PPI use 12,14,41, we 
found no consistent association between cumulative PPI use and risk of hip fracture. Thus, based on 
our results, pharmacological mechanism between the association of PPI use and hip fracture seems 
to be unlikely. In addition, Targownik et al.22, found no changes in bone mineral density with long-
term PPI use.  
Our finding concerning short-term current PPI use and increased risk of hip fracture, is in line with 
previous case-control studies conducted among general population13,15,16, which all reported the 
slightly increased risk in current use but no significant risk in long-term or cumulative use. 
Additionally, the study of Adams et al, which was restricted to men only, reported the highest risk 
at the beginning of the treatment which is consistent with our results.42 The highest risk during 
short-term PPI use might be explained so that PPIs are prescribed to persons with high risk for falling 
because of their unstable health condition. Current PPI users had more comorbidities and used 
more frequently fall-risk increasing drugs. Although the analysis was adjusted for several diseases 
and drug use, it is possible that these adjustments did not fully capture the severity and symptoms 
of the possible underlying health conditions influencing PPI use. This is supported by findings of 
previous studies, which reported that PPIs are used as gastroprotection for reducing the adverse 
effects caused by drugs or exacerbation of diseases.7,43 
 11 
 
Our study found no differences between drug substances and risk of hip fracture. Three previous 
studies have reported differences between drug substances.16,42,44 Two found an increased risk 
associated with omeprazole use16,42 compared to non-use of omeprazole, and one found no 
significant differences.44  
Psychotropic drugs, which have been previously shown to be associated with an increased risk of 
hip fractures35-37 were more commonly used by persons with hip fracture than their controls. 
Consistent to previous studies41,45, persons with hip fracture were more likely to have epilepsy or 
previous fracture or stroke, which are also risk factors for falling.11 Opioids were used more 
commonly among hip fracture cases compared to controls, which indicates that pain was more 
prevalent among cases and may be one reason for falling and fracture.  
Our study had strengths and limitations. A large, qualified, nationwide data allowed an extensive 
study including information of diagnoses, drug purchases, special reimbursements, hospital stays 
and socioeconomic position and combining the information personally with Personal Identification 
Numbers. Drug use periods were modelled with PRE2DUP model, which has been validated against 
self-reported drug use from interview and expert-opinion based evaluation.31,32 Controls were 
matched with cases according to time since Alzheimer’s disease diagnoses which was the 
best available proxy for the stage of Alzheimer’s disease, which is a major risk factor for falling and 
therefore, fractures.  Validity of hip fracture diagnoses in Hospital Discharge Register are proven to 
be good.46 However, we lacked information on lifestyle factors, such as nutrition, physical activity 
or limitations, smoking or alcohol use, which are associated with falling risk.11 In Addition, we had 
no information of indications for drug use, laboratory test results such as serum B12-vitamin levels, 
severity of diseases or Over the Counter drug use. As PPI users seem to have several comorbidities 
 12 
 
and medications, residual confounding cannot be ruled out and may partly explain the association 
between short-term PPI use and hip fracture.  
There was no risk increase for long-term or cumulative PPI use and thus, our findings do not support 
previous assumptions that long-term PPI use would be associated with an increased risk of hip 
fractures. The risk of hip fracture was modestly increased during current short-term PPI use, which 
may be partly explained by other diseases and medications. At least in terms of hip fracture, long-
term use of PPI can be considered among persons with Alzheimer’s disease if the treatment is 
necessary.
