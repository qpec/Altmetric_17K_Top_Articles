Abstract
People with psychotic disorders show abnormalities in several organ systems in addition to the central nervous system
(CNS); and this contributes to excess mortality. However, it is unclear how strong the evidence is for alterations in non-CNS
systems at the onset of psychosis, how the alterations in non-CNS systems compare to those in the CNS, or how they relate
to symptoms. Here, we consider these questions, and suggest potential models to account for findings. We conducted a
systematic meta-review to summarize effect sizes for both CNS (focusing on brain structural, neurophysiological, and
neurochemical parameters) and non-CNS dysfunction (focusing on immune, cardiometabolic, and hypothalamic–pituitary–
adrenal (HPA) systems) in first-episode psychosis (FEP). Relevant meta-analyses were identified in a systematic search of
Pubmed and the methodological quality of these was assessed using the AMSTAR checklist (A Measurement Tool to Assess
Systematic Reviews). Case–control data were extracted from studies included in these meta-analyses. Random effects meta-
analyses were re-run and effect size magnitudes for individual parameters were calculated, as were summary effect sizes for
each CNS and non-CNS system. We also grouped studies to obtain overall effect sizes for non-CNS and CNS alterations.
Robustness of data for non-CNS and CNS parameters was assessed using Rosenthal’s fail-safe N. We next statistically
compared summary effect size for overall CNSand overall non-CNS alterations, as well as for each organ system separately.
We also examined how non-CNS alterations correlate CNS alterations, and with psychopathological symptoms. Case-
control data were extracted for 165 studies comprising a total sample size of 13,440. For people with first episode psychosis
compared with healthy controls, we observed alterations in immune parameters (summary effect size: g = 1.19),
cardiometabolic parameters (g = 0.23); HPA parameters (g = 0.68); brain structure (g = 0.40); neurophysiology (g = 0.80);
and neurochemistry (g = 0.43). Grouping non-CNS organ systems together provided an effect size for overall non-CNS
alterations in patients compared with controls (g = 0.58), which was not significantly different from the overall CNS
alterations effect size (g = 0.50). However, the summary effect size for immune alterations was significantly greater than that
for brain structural (P < 0.001) and neurochemical alterations (P < 0.001), while the summary effect size for cardiometabolic
alterations was significantly lower than neurochemical (P = 0.04), neurophysiological (P < 0.001), and brain structural
alterations (P = 0.001). The summary effect size for HPA
alterations was not significantly different from brain
structural (P = 0.14), neurophysiological (P = 0.54), or
neurochemical
alterations
(P = 0.22).
These
outcomes
remained similar in antipsychotic naive sensitivity analyses.
We found some, but limited and inconsistent, evidence that
non-CNS alterations were associated with CNS changes and
symptoms in first episode psychosis. Our findings indicate
that there are robust alterations in non-CNS systems in
psychosis, and that these are broadly similar in magnitude to
a range of CNS alterations. We consider models that could
account for these findings and discuss implications for
future research and treatment.

 Introduction
Schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders have a
worldwide lifetime prevalence of ~1% [1]. They are highly
disabling conditions with economic costs over $60 billion
per year in the United States [2, 3]. Epidemiological studies
have established that people with psychotic disorders die
15–20 years earlier than the general population, and that
60% or more of this premature mortality relates to non-
CNS, predominantly cardiovascular, causes [4–8]. Poor
physical health has traditionally been blamed on the sec-
ondary effects of the illness, be that a consequence of the
illness itself (e.g., negative symptoms leading to sedentary
lifestyle and poor diet) [9], or a consequence of treatment
(e.g., second-generation antipsychotic use) [10]. In recent
years however, studies in first-episode patients have shown
dysfunction in cardiometabolic [11–16], immune [17–21],
and hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) [22–25] systems.
This suggests that psychotic disorders involve multiple
systems at onset. However, it is unclear how strong the
evidence is for abnormalities across these systems, how
alterations compare with CNS abnormalities seen in the
disorder, or how they relate to symptoms. To address these
questions, we perform a meta-review of the magnitude,
consistency, and robustness of dysfunction across these
systems as assessed using peripheral markers, and compare
findings with representative CNS abnormalities in psy-
chosis. We then review the potential models that could
explain the associations, before considering both the
research and clinical implications of our findings.
Methods
Systematic meta-review summarizing effect size
magnitudes for central nervous system and non-
central nervous system alterations in first-episode
psychosis
Full details of methods employed are documented in Sup-
plementary Information (eAppendix 1). Two systematic
reviews of meta-analyses were performed according to
preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-
analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [26] (Supplementary Infor-
mation, eTable 1). Two reviewers (TP and ED) indepen-
dently searched Pubmed from 1990 to May week 2 2017 for
each systematic meta-review. For the meta-review focuss-
ing on non-CNS dysfunction, we focused on meta-analyses
of findings in three organ systems established as showing
dysregulation in schizophrenia: the immune [27], cardio-
metabolic [28], and HPA [29] systems. We selected meta-
analyses reporting markers of immune, cardiometabolic,
and HPA system differences between patient and control
groups, rather than differences in rates of diagnoses of
conditions based on pre-defined diagnostic criteria [30–33]
(e.g., rates of diagnoses of type 2 diabetes mellitus or
hypercholesterolemia). The rationale behind this metho-
dology was threefold. First, patients with psychotic illness
are less likely to seek medical attention and so there is the
risk of under-reporting of diagnoses [34]. Second, certain
conditions, such as glucose and lipid dysregulation, develop
on a continuum and take time for serum/plasma markers to
reach threshold for a diagnosis. For example, changes in
glucose regulation occur 4–7 years prior to diagnosis of
type 2 diabetes mellitus [35]. Third, physiological altera-
tions that do not meet diagnostic thresholds can, never-
theless, be associated with worsened mortality/morbidity
outcomes. For example, there is robust evidence that low-
grade inflammation is an independent risk factor for ather-
osclerosis and cardiovascular disease [36]. For the meta-
review focussing on CNS dysfunction, we focused on meta-
analyses of parameters previously identified in an expert
review as key neurobiological alterations seen in schizo-
phrenia [37], covering alterations in brain structure, neuro-
physiology, and neurochemistry. The search was limited to
first-episode psychosis (FEP) to limit secondary effects of
illness.
Patient and control data from the studies referenced in
the meta-analyses that our search terms had identified were
extracted and all meta-analyses repeated. Data were only
extracted for those CNS and non-CNS parameters, where
there were significant differences demonstrated between
FEP and controls in the original meta-analyses. A two-tailed
P < 0.05 was deemed significant. A minimum of three stu-
dies was required to run a meta-analysis. For non-CNS
parameters, random-effects meta-analyses were performed
examining
immune
(interleukin-1β
(IL-1β),
soluble
interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumour
necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), transforming growth factor-β
(TGF-β), C-reactive protein (CRP), and total lymphocyte
count), cardiometabolic (fasting glucose, glucose post-oral
glucose tolerance test (OGTT), fasting insulin, insulin
resistance (HOMA-IR), total cholesterol, low density lipo-
protein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides), and HPA
parameters (cortisol awakening response and prolactin
concentrations). For CNS parameters, random-effects meta-
analyses were performed examining brain structural (total
brain volume, total grey matter volume, total CSF volume,
right and left hippocampus, right and left lateral ventricle,
total thalamus, right and left caudate nucleus), neurophy-
siological (auditory P300 amplitude and latency, duration
deviant mismatch negativity), and neurochemical para-
meters (frontal, temporal and thalamus N-acetylaspartic acid
(NAA) levels). A random-effects model was used in all
analyses owing to an expectation of heterogeneity of data
across studies. Standardized mean differences between

meta-analysis is that it may be based on a biased sample of
studies, potentially inflating effect sizes. Thus, for each

calculate the number of additional null studies (i.e., studies
where the effect size is zero) that would be required to

 increase the P value for a given meta-analysis to greater
than 0.05. This provides an assessment of how bias could
influence the results of a meta-analysis: the greater the
number of estimated studies required for the finding to be
no longer significant, the less likely the results are sec-
ondary to publication or small sample bias and therefore the
more robust the finding. Methodological quality of each
meta-analysis was assessed using the AMSTAR checklist
(A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews)
(eAppendix 2). Heterogeneity scores for samples within
each meta-analysis were also recorded, as assessed using
the χ2 test, Q, or I2 statistic (Tables 1 and 2).
As well as individual meta-analyses being run for each
parameter as described, six separate subgroup meta-
analyses were
performed
examining
data
for overall
immune, cardiometabolic, HPA, brain structural, neuro-
physiological, and neurochemical systems. Subgroup sum-
mary effect size magnitudes were calculated by running a
combined analysis of all studies assigned to a subgroup
(e.g., to calculate the summary effect size magnitude for
immune alterations, a single analysis was performed that
combined IL-1β, sIL-2R, IL-6, TNF-α, TGF-β, CRP, and
total lymphocyte count data sets). If a single study provided
results for more than one subgroup parameter (e.g., data for
several cytokines from a single study population), then the
patient and control numbers for that study were divided by
the number of parameters contributed to the summary meta-
analysis (e.g., if two different cytokines were reported by a
single study, then the population number for that study was
divided by 2). Using the same methodology, overall meta-
analyses for CNS and non-CNS alterations were calculated.
Sensitivity analyses for antipsychotic naive FEP were
performed.
Statistical comparison of effect sizes for central
nervous system and non-central nervous system
alterations in first-episode psychosis
After obtaining effect size estimates for each CNS (brain
structural, neurophysiological, and neurochemical) and non-
CNS system (immune, cardiometabolic, and HPA), we next
performed bivariate comparisons of each of these six effect
sizes against one another using a Wald-type test. We
determined statistical significance by entering each pair of
effect size estimates into a fixed effects model (given that
the residual heterogeneity had previously been accounted
for in the initial random effects meta-analyses). P < 0.05
was deemed significant. This method was also used to
compare overall summary CNS and non-CNS effect sizes.
Sensitivity analyses were performed restricting analyses to
antipsychotic naive cohorts. All statistical tests were con-
ducted using the metafor package [39] in the R statistical
programming language.
Results
For non-CNS dysfunction, of 365 citations retrieved, 15
meta-analyses met inclusion criteria [11–25] (Table 1). For
CNS dysfunction, of 446 citations retrieved, 13 meta-
analyses met inclusion criteria [40–52] (Table 2). Data were
extracted from a total of 165 case–control studies (eAp-
pendix 3). After excluding overlapping samples, the total
sample size was 13,440 (6806 patients and 6634 controls),
with 6817 in the non-CNS sample (3300 patients and 3517
controls), and 6623 in the CNS sample (3506 patients and
3117 controls). The quality of studies was medium to high
(AMSTAR scores 6–10, Tables 1 and 2).
Meta-analytic outcomes for central nervous system
and non-central nervous system alterations in first-
episode psychosis
Figure 1a depicts a forest plot for magnitude of immune, car-
diometabolic, HPA, brain structural, neurophysiological, and
neurochemical alterations in first-episode psychosis compared
with healthy controls, as well as overall summary effect sizes
for CNS and non-CNS alterations. As per Cohen’s guidelines
[53], a medium overall summary effect size for non-CNS
alterations
in
FEP
was
observed,
(g = 0.58 (95%
CI:
0.44–0.72). A medium overall summary effect size for CNS
alterations in FEP was also observed (g = 0.50 (95% CI:
0.44–0.56). Similar results were observed in antipsychotic
naive sensitivity analyses (effect size for non-CNS alterations:
g = 0.51 (95% CI: 0.34–0.67); effect size for CNS alterations:
g = 0.48 (95% CI: 0.39–0.58), eFigure 3).
The immune system
Five meta-analyses examining immune disturbances in FEP
were identified [17–21]. Four meta-analyses examined
inflammatory mediators [17–20], and one lymphocyte counts
[21]. After allowing for overlapping studies, data were
extracted for a total sample size of 1343 patients and 1643
controls. FEP is associated with elevated blood cytokine
levels, specifically IL-1β, sIL2R, IL-6, TNFα, TGFβ, CRP,
and elevated total lymphocyte counts (effect size range:
0.61–1.62) (Fig. 1a). The summary effect size of immune
alterations in FEP is 1.19 (95% CI: 0.82–1.56). Fail-safe N
calculations demonstrated that between 17 and 1639 addi-
tional negative studies would be required for these findings to
lose significance. Heterogeneity of studies was low to high
(I2: 0–98%), and study quality medium to high (AMSTAR:
6–9). Antipsychotic naive FEP is associated with elevated
blood cytokine levels, specifically IL-1β, sIL2R, IL-6, and
TNFα (effect size: 1.00–1.86). The overall effect size for
magnitude of immune alterations in antipsychotic naive FEP
is 1.46 (95% CI: 0.74–2.18) (eFigure 3).

 The cardiometabolic system
Six meta-analyses examining cardiometabolic dysfunction
in FEP were identified [11–16]. Three meta-analyses
focused on glucose and insulin disturbance [11–13], two
on lipid disturbance [14, 16], and one on oxidative stress
[15]. After allowing for overlapping studies, data were
extracted for a total sample size of 1556 patients and 1480
controls. All data extracted were for antipsychotic naive
individuals. Antipsychotic naive FEP is associated with
elevated fasting glucose, glucose following the oral glucose
tolerance test, fasting insulin, and insulin resistance (effect
size range 0.20–0.61), raised triglycerides (effect size:
0.14), and reduced total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol
(effect size range: −0.22 to −0.19) (Fig. 1a). We were
unable to extract sufficient data to allow for a meta-analysis
of oxidative stress parameters in FEP. The summary effect
size of cardiometabolic alterations in antipsychotic naive
FEP is 0.23 (95% CI: 0.15–0.31). Fail-safe N calculations
demonstrate that between 26 and 97 additional negative
studies would be required for findings to lose significance.
Heterogeneity was low to high (I2: 0–97%), and study
quality medium to high (AMSTAR: 7–10).
The hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal system
Four meta-analyses examining HPA dysregulation in FEP
were identified [22–25]. Two meta-analyses reported on
morning cortisol [23, 24], one on cortisol awakening
response [22], and one on prolactin levels [25]. Prolactin

 levels were included as a marker of HPA axis activation
owing to previous evidence that its levels increase in
response to various stressors, with a direct correlation
observed between prolactin levels and both adrenocortico-
trophic hormone and cortisol levels in healthy controls [54].
Data were extracted for a total sample size of 401 patients
and 394 controls. The cortisol awakening response is
blunted in FEP (effect size: 0.62), and prolactin levels are
elevated in antipsychotic naive FEP [25] (effect size: 0.74)
(Fig. 1a). The summary effect size of HPA alterations in
FEP is 0.68 (95% CI: 0.32–1.04). Fail-safe N calculations
demonstrate that between 75 and 125 negative studies
would be required for these findings to lose significance.
Heterogeneity was low to high (I2: 24–83%), and study
quality high (AMSTAR: 9–10). There were insufficient data
to allow for a meta-analysis of cortisol awakening response
in antipsychotic naive FEP.
Central nervous system: brain structural changes
Eight meta-analyses examining brain structure in FEP were
identified [40, 42–47, 55]. Data were extracted for a total
sample size of 1937 patients and 1656 controls. FEP is
associated with reductions in both total and regional brain
volumes (effect size: 0.26–0.58), and an increase in CSF
volume (effect size: 0.34) (Fig. 1a). The summary effect
size of brain structural alteration in FEP is 0.40 (95% CI:
0.33–0.47).
Fail-safe
N
calculations
demonstrate
that
between 27 and 663 additional negative studies would be
required for these findings to lose significance. Hetero-
geneity was low to medium (I2: 9–56%), and study quality
medium (AMSTAR: 4–7). Antipsychotic naive FEP is also
associated with total and regional brain volume reduction
(effect size: 0.23–0.87), and an in increase in total CSF
volume (effect size: 0.32). The summary effect size of brain
structural alterations in antipsychotic naive FEP is 0.44
(95% CI: 0.34–0.54) (eFigure 3).
Central nervous system: neurophysiological changes
Four meta-analyses examining neurophysiological changes in
FEP were identified [48–51]. Data were extracted for a total
sample size of 1051 patients and 980 controls. FEP is asso-
ciated with decreased auditory P300 amplitude (effect size:
0.83), and reduced duration-deviant mismatch negativity
(effect size: 0.77) (Fig. 1a). The summary effect size for
magnitude of neurophysiological alteration in FEP is 0.80
(95% CI: 0.64–0.96). Fail-safe N calculations demonstrate
that between 450 and 1100 additional negative studies would
be required for these findings to lose significance. Sample
heterogeneity was medium to high (I2: 55–86%), and study
quality medium to high (AMSTAR: 4–8). Antipsychotic
naive FEP is associated with a reduction in auditory P300
amplitude (effect size: 0.86) and latency (effect size: 0.63), as
well as a reduction in duration-deviant mismatch negativity
(effect size: 0.67). The overall effect size for magnitude of
neurophysiological alterations in antipsychotic naive FEP is
0.70 (95% CI: 0.47–0.94) (eFigure 3).

 Central nervous system: neurochemical changes
One meta-analysis examining brain chemistry in FEP was
identified [52]. Data were extracted for a total sample size of
518 patients and 481 controls. FEP is associated with
decreased levels of N-acetyl aspartate concentrations across
multiple brain regions (effect size: 0.35–0.50) (Fig. 1a). The
overall effect size for magnitude of neurochemical alteration
in FEP is 0.43 (95% CI: 0.26–0.60). Fail-safe N calculations
demonstrate that between 19 and 359 additional negative
studies would be required for these findings to lose sig-
nificance. Sample heterogeneity was low to medium (I2:
23–63%), and study quality medium (AMSTAR: 5). Anti-
psychotic naive FEP is associated with a reduction in frontal
cortical NAA (ES: 0.34) (eFigure 3).
Statistical comparison of effect sizes for central
nervous system and non-central nervous system
alterations in first-episode psychosis
Overall, CNS and non-CNS effect sizes were compared
using a Wald-type test. There was no significant difference
between the overall effect size of alterations in the CNS
compared with the overall effect size of alterations in the
non-CNS systems examined (P = 0.283), and this remained
the case when analyses were restricted to studies of anti-
psychotic naive patients (P = 0.825).
Individual system comparisons
A heat map of respective Wald scores and associated sig-
nificance values between each of the systems examined
(immune, cardiometabolic, HPA, brain structural, neuro-
chemical, and neurophysiological) was constructed to allow
graphical representation of the relative effect size magnitude
difference between systems (Fig. 1b). Wald test compar-
isons of overall immune effect size with CNS effect sizes in
FEP demonstrated significantly higher effect size magni-
tudes for immune alterations compared with brain structural
(P < 0.001) and neurochemical (P < 0.001) alterations, and
no significant difference when compared with neurophy-
siological alterations (P = 0.053). For antipsychotic naive
FEP, summary effect size for immune alterations was sig-
nificantly higher in antipsychotic naive FEP compared with
brain structural (P = 0.006) and neurochemical alterations
(P = 0.005), and no significant difference when compared
with neurophysiological alterations (P = 0.05) (eFigure 4).
Comparisons of the summary effect size for cardiometa-
bolic alterations with those for CNS alterations in anti-
psychotic naive FEP demonstrated significantly reduced
effect size magnitudes for cardiometabolic alterations
compared with brain structural (P = 0.001), neurochemical
(P = 0.04), and neurophysiological alterations (P < 0.001).
Comparisons of summary effect size of HPA with those for
CNS alterations in FEP demonstrated no significant differ-
ence when compared with brain structural (P = 0.14),
neurochemical (P = 0.217), and neurophysiological (P =
0.541) alterations.
Correlations between non-central nervous system
parameters and central nervous system parameters
In view of evidence of both CNS and non-CNS alterations
in FEP, we examined evidence for associations between
these parameters. Only a limited number of observational
studies have investigated relationships between CNS and
non-CNS measures in FEP. Studies in broader psychotic
illness, including schizophrenia, present data that is con-
flicting, which may reflect the heterogeneity of the popu-
lation studied, but also the multi-faceted roles of the
metabolic, immune, and endocrine parameters we have
examined. For example, IL-6 has both neurodegenerative
[56] and neuroprotective properties [57]. Thus, conflicting
outcomes
with
regard
to
correlations
between
pro-
inflammatory cytokines and brain structural alterations
might be expected. Indeed, in schizophrenia, hippocampal
volumes correlate directly with the pro-inflammatory cyto-
kine interleukin-18 [58], while pro-inflammatory IL-1β
titres correlate indirectly with Broca’s area volume in a
“pro-inflammatory” subgroup of patients [59]. Thus, we
have evidence of elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines
being differentially associated with regional brain volume
alterations: further studies are required to clarify regional
brain structural alterations in the context of systemic
inflammation in FEP. In terms of HPA axis alterations and
influence on regional brain structure, although one study
has failed to demonstrate a relationship between cortisol
levels and hippocampal volume in FEP [60], Mondelli and
colleagues have reported an inverse correlation between
blood cortisol levels and hippocampal volumes [61], and
the degree of left-sided hippocampal volume reduction has
been associated with a blunted cortisol awakening response
in FEP [62]. Beyond brain structural alterations, in schi-
zophrenia, diffusion tensor imaging has demonstrated that
peripheral IL-6 levels inversely correlate with measures of
fractional anisotropy in the forceps major, inferior long-
itudinal fasciculus (ILF), and inferior fronto-occipital fas-
ciculus (IFOF), a relationship not demonstrated in healthy
controls. In both the ILF and IFOF, IL-6 levels correlate
directly with radial diffusivity measures. CRP levels in
schizophrenia also show an inverse correlation with frac-
tional anisotropy within the forceps major [63]. Thus, in
psychosis, selected neural pathways may be differentially
susceptible to systemic immune alterations, although repli-
cation of these findings is required. We were unable to find
any studies in FEP exploring correlations between CNS
786

 parameters and cardiometabolic disturbances. In individuals
with type 2 diabetes who do not have a psychotic disorder,
insulin resistance is associated with hippocampal atrophy
and memory impairment [64]. Since cognitive impairment
is a key feature of psychotic illness, and we have demon-
strated that antipsychotic naive FEP is associated with both
insulin resistance and reduced hippocampal volumes, future
structural imaging studies combined with metabolic assays
are required to clarify if a correlation between impaired
glucose homeostasis and hippocampal structural alterations
also exists in FEP.
Correlations between non-CNS parameters and
symptom severity
Although the evidence presented indicates that cardiome-
tabolic, immune, and HPA alterations are present in early
psychosis, this does not indicate whether these abnormal-
ities are linked to the clinical expression of the disorder. As
such, we also examined evidence of a “biological gradient”
between these markers and symptom measures. In anti-
psychotic naive FEP, positive symptom severity, as asses-
sed using the positive and negative syndrome scale
(PANSS), correlates indirectly with fasting glucose levels
[65] and insulin resistance [66], indicating more severe
symptoms are associated with less marked glucoregulatory
disturbance. As part of a meta-analysis examining CRP
titres in schizophrenia performed by Fernandes and col-
leagues [67], meta-regression of effect size for CRP changes
on PANSS-positive scores demonstrated that the greater the
severity of positive symptoms, the greater the increase in
CRP (r = 0.12; 95% CI: 0.03–0.23; P = 0.013). Broader
evidence for a biological gradient between symptom
severity and inflammatory cytokines in psychosis is how-
ever inconsistent and contradictory. For example, in anti-
psychotic naive FEP, levels of the anti-inflammatory
cytokine IL-10 inversely correlate with PANSS-negative
scores [68], indicating this anti-inflammatory marker is
associated with less severe symptoms, however PANSS-
positive scores in FEP have been observed to inversely
correlate with pro-inflammatory IL-6 [69]. Studies in
broader psychotic illness have demonstrated that IL-6 levels
correlate directly with total psychopathology [70, 71],
however others have failed to demonstrate an association
[72–74]. No significant correlations have been reported
between TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-12, and TGF-β levels with
symptomatology in FEP [75–78]. Correlations between
HPA axis alterations and symptom severity in FEP are
similarly inconsistent and contradictory. For example,
although cortisol levels have been observed to directly
correlate with symptom severity [79–81], there have been
negative studies [82–84], and inverse correlations with ill-
ness severity reported [85]. Varied outcomes may be a
consequence of heterogeneity of patient populations and
parameter measurement techniques between studies. Future
projects may benefit from recruitment of a more homo-
genous group of participants, either by applying more
stringent diagnostic inclusion criteria (e.g., focussing on
individuals with predominant negative or positive symp-
toms, as demonstrated by Kirkpatrick and colleagues who
defined differences in glucose tolerance between deficit and
non-deficit schizophrenia) [86] or by stratifying patients
based on a pre-defined physiological parameter (e.g., a
“pro-inflammatory” group based on cytokine titres) [59].
Discussion
The evidence analyzed in this review, compiled from 165
case–control
studies
and
an
overall
sample
size
of
13,440 subjects, indicates that there are a range of significant
non-CNS as well as CNS alterations in patients with first-
episode psychosis (summarized in Fig. 2a), and that the
overall magnitudes of alteration for CNS and non-CNS
alterations are not significantly different. Fail-safe N calcula-
tions, which provide a surrogate marker of how robust these
findings are, demonstrate that large numbers of null studies
would need to be added to these meta-analyses for both CNS
and non-CNS outcomes to lose statistical significance (fail-
safe N ranges: immune 17–1639; HPA 75–125; cardiometa-
bolic 26–97; brain structural 27–663; neurophysiological
450–1100; neurochemical 19–359). Although our review of
observational studies in psychosis suggests that there may be a
link between certain non-CNS and CNS alterations as well as
some non-CNS parameters and symptom severity, the number
of these correlative studies is small and the results are
inconsistent, making definitive inferences difficult.
Strengths and limitations
The major strength of this meta-review is its focus on FEP
and antipsychotic naive data. Thus, where possible the
confounding effects of illness chronicity and treatment were
limited. There are of course limitations to studies examining
physical dysfunction in FEP (see limitations box). It is
important to recognize that the FEP population is inevitably
diagnostically heterogenous. To investigate the degree of
heterogeneity, we extracted the diagnoses of patients from
each study where reported (see eAppendix4). This shows
that the overall proportion of FEP patients included in our
analyses who had a diagnosis of schizophrenia was 74% in
the non-CNS group and 84% in the CNS group. While
some of the patients without a diagnosis of schizophrenia
will go on to develop schizophrenia, it still important to
recognize that some will never develop schizophrenia and,
consequently, our findings should not be taken as being

 specific to schizophrenia. While the difference in the pro-
portion with schizophrenia between groups is modest, we
cannot exclude that this has moderated the effect sizes.
Thus, we recommend future FEP studies include follow-up
to determine diagnoses, and report findings separately by
diagnosis to enable this to be tested. The specificity of
findings is also low, with other serious mental illnesses
showing similar physiological dysfunction [87, 88]. How-
ever, it should be recognized that many of the same factors
apply to CNS alterations, and reverse causality is possible,
with lifestyle factors potentially impacting both CNS and
non-CNS measures. For example, smoking [89], stress [90],
drug [91], and alcohol [92] abuse are associated with gray
matter volume loss. Despite our focus on early psychosis,
studies often fail to report or examine the impact of duration
of untreated psychosis. As such, it remains possible that
non-CNS changes are secondary to emerging psychotic
symptoms, e.g., due to resultant poor lifestyle habits, social
isolation, and stress [93, 94]. Moreover, inconsistencies in
studies investigating a “biological gradient” between CNS
and non-CNS alterations, and non-CNS alterations with
symptom severity, limit arguments regarding non-CNS
alterations contributing to pathological causality in psy-
chosis as per Bradford Hill’s guidelines [95]. Although
meta-analysis as a methodology is a powerful tool to
summarize research knowledge in a field, it has limitations
[96]. These limitations relate to the reliability of a meta-
analysis’ outcome being dependent on the quality of the
data meta-analyzed, the size of the samples included, the
potential for type 1 error owing to publication bias toward
“positive” results, and the heterogeneity of study popula-
tions included. However, our quality assessment of meta-
analyses selected for this review was reassuring, with only
medium-high quality analyses included. Although hetero-
geneity of studies documented by these meta-analyses
varied, our meta-analyses used a random-effects model
which is robust to heterogeneity. The fail-safe N approach
has limitations [97]. For example, the formula assumes that
the mean effect of unpublished null studies is zero, whereas
studies may also have negative effect sizes, thereby
requiring fewer studies to nullify the mean effect. However,
the fail-safe N was applied across organ systems, thus,
assuming there is similar publication bias across CNS and
non-CNS research fields in psychosis, we can be confident
that the fail-safe N is a reasonable quantitative measure by
which the relative strength of the evidence supporting
alterations in CNS and non-CNS parameters can be asses-
sed. Indeed, fail-safe N calculations suggest outcomes for
certain CNS and non-CNS parameters are more robust than
others (Fig. 1a). Of the 15 comparative Wald analyses
between CNS and non-CNS alterations in FEP, only four
contrasts changed significance (based on α < 0.05) when
moving from medicated to antipsychotic naive sensitivity
analyses. There was no difference overall between CNS and
non-CNS effect size magnitudes in both medicated and
antipsychotic
naive
cohorts.
This
suggests
that
anti-
psychotic treatment does not significantly moderate effect
sizes documented, providing further evidence that CNS and
non-CNS alterations co-occur in FEP.
The putative nature of the relationship between
central nervous system and non-central nervous
system abnormalities in first-episode psychosis
Figure 2b–d illustrates three putative models that could
explain our findings of both non-CNS and CNS abnormal-
ities in FEP. Model 1 (Fig. 2b) shows how a risk factor
inducing non-CNS dysfunction may lead to development of
non-CNS disorders as well as impacting CNS function
leading to psychosis. An example is that of paraneoplastic-
induced anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor ence-
phalitis, which is associated with psychosis. Resection of the
causative tumor is associated with resolution of psychotic
experiences [98]. More broadly, immune dysregulation
could be responsible for co-development of psychosis and
cardiometabolic disease. Pre-clinical studies demonstrate
that peripheral inflammation can induce neuro-inflammation
[99], which could potentially contribute to the pathogenesis
of psychosis [100]. There is also evidence of inflammatory
cytokines modulating dopaminergic and glutamatergic neu-
rotransmission [101, 102]. As dysfunction in these neuro-
transmitters is implicated in the development of psychosis
[103], this could link cytokine alterations to development of
psychosis. As chronic inflammation is associated with
accelerated atherosclerotic plaque formation, insulin resis-
tance, and increased cardiovascular risk [36], elevated
cytokines in psychosis could also be playing a role in the
increased risk of cardiovascular disease in this population.
Altered lipid turnover both peripherally and centrally may
also be a consequence of an inflammatory process in FEP.
Total and LDL cholesterol are reduced in antipsychotic
naive FEP compared with healthy controls, a finding that is
maintained in body mass index (BMI) sensitivity analyses
[14, 16]. It has been hypothesized that the pro-inflammatory
state of FEP is responsible for a “paradoxical” reduction in
cholesterol via a similar mechanism seen in inflammatory
arthritides [16]. Whether a similar mechanism modulates
CNS lipid metabolism in schizophrenia and thus plays a role
in disease pathogenesis through resultant synaptic dysfunc-
tion remains unclear. Such a mechanism would fit with
model 1. In contrast, model 2 (Fig. 2c) shows how a risk
factor can induce CNS dysfunction resulting in psychotic
symptoms, which then trigger non-CNS dysfunction. An
example is that the stress of psychosis could lead to HPA
axis
activation.

 with hypertension, obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia,
and cardiovascular disease [105]. Thus, hypercortisolemia
associated with psychosis may be contributing to cardio-
metabolic disease. It should however be recognized that, in
addition to causing non-CNS dysfunction, stress may also
contribute to the development of psychosis [106], suggesting
a model whereby an exposure contributes jointly to CNS and
non-CNS dysfunction. Finally, model 3 (Fig. 2d) proposes
that a common risk factor has independent and parallel
effects that result in the separate development of psychosis
and non-CNS dysfunction. For example, population-based
cohort studies have demonstrated that cardiometabolic dis-
ease [107] and psychosis share risk factors, including low-
birth weight [108], pre-term birth [109, 110], and maternal
malnutrition [111, 112]. Nutritional deficiencies in utero
may result in neurodevelopmental changes increasing vul-
nerability to psychosis [113]. Nutritional deficiencies may
also result in epigenetic changes relating to metabolic
function, leading to metabolic alterations and ultimately
diabetes [114]. Similarly, there may be shared genetic risk
between psychosis and non-CNS disturbances. Genome-
wide association studies have demonstrated pleiotropic
enrichment between genes conferring risk for schizophrenia
and non-CNS alterations, including immune and metabolic
processes [115, 116].
Critique and comparison of the models
The models discussed above are intended to summarize the
main potential relationships that exist between CNS and non-
CNS alterations in psychosis, and it should be recognized that
there is evidence for and against each model. The relative
strengths and weakness of the three models proposed are
summarized in Supplementary Information (eBox 1). Model 1
is supported by cases where a non-CNS disorder clearly
predates psychosis, which resolves when the non-CNS dis-
order is treated, such as the example of NMDA auto-
antibodies leading to psychosis discussed above, but these
cases are rare [98]. Moreover, population-based cohort studies
have observed that elevated levels of serum CRP [117] and
IL-6 [118] in childhood are associated with increased risk of
psychotic experience and schizophrenia in adulthood. Fur-
thermore, the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study
(NAPLS) [119] has provided evidence that hypercortisolemia,
inflammation, and elevated oxidative stress in individuals
already deemed to be at risk for developing psychosis are risk
factors for transition to FEP. However, many associations
between non-CNS dysfunction and psychosis have not shown
evidence of causation to date. To demonstrate causality, non-
CNS dysfunction needs to be addressed prior to the onset of
psychosis, for example in the prodrome, and show that the
development of psychosis is prevented. In addition, although
model 1 explains rare cases of psychosis, it is unlikely to
account for typical cases of schizophrenia where CNS
alterations are thought to occur early in neurodevelopment
[106], unless non-CNS alterations also occur very early in
development. Model 2, where non-CNS dysfunction emerges
as a consequence of psychosis, is supported by meta-analytic
evidence that resolution of acute psychosis is associated with
normalization of previously elevated cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6,
and TGF-β) [19]. Also, there is only limited evidence for
alterations of certain non-CNS parameters in the prodrome
(e.g., glucose and lipid disturbances), suggesting their later
development may be a consequence of psychosis or its
treatment. However, as described in support of model 1,
several non-CNS alterations have been demonstrated in the
prodrome. In addition, the observed reduction in levels of
cytokines in association with the resolution of an acute psy-
chotic episode could be part of the therapeutic action of
treatment (supportive of model 1 rather than 2). Model 3,
where a shared risk factor plays a role in development of
psychosis
and
non-CNS
alterations
through
divergent
mechanisms, is supported by the lack of consistent relation-
ships between a number of CNS and non-CNS alterations.
Also, the heterogeneity in both non-CNS and CNS findings
between
patients
could
suggest
divergent
mechanisms
underlie them [120]. However, we have identified certain
correlations, e.g., between glucose dysregulation [65], insulin
resistance [66], and PANSS-positive scores in FEP, that point
toward these non-CNS alterations being linked with the
clinical expression of psychosis, consistent with, although not
proving, a common pathoetiological mechanism. Moreover,
there is a paucity of studies testing relationships between non-
CNS and CNS alterations in psychosis, limiting any conclu-
sions regarding common causality. Overall, there is both
supportive and contradictory evidence for all three models,
and aspects of each model that remain to be fully tested. The
contradictory evidence suggests that one model is unlikely to
account for all cases of psychosis. Moreover, while the
models provide an overarching framework, the specific
mechanisms that might link risk factors, CNS and non-CNS
alterations need to be investigated. Further work is clearly
needed, particularly to investigate the causal nature of rela-
tionships, and how common they are to patients in general.
Does the involvement of multiple systems in first-
episode psychosis indicate that psychosis is a
multisystem disorder?
Conceptually, multisystem disorders can be categorized into
two groups: [121] (1) conditions where multiple organ
systems are pervasively affected with no single predominant
organ involved (e.g., inborn errors of metabolism); (2)
conditions where one organ system is predominantly
affected, but where other organs may concurrently be
involved (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis). Since psychosis is by

 definition a description of psychological phenomena, it
would be hard to argue that psychosis meets the first defi-
nition. However, consistent with the second definition, the
evidence reviewed above suggests that early in psychosis
dysfunction is present across multiple organ systems. Given
the large effect sizes and number of negative studies
required for many of these to become no longer significant,
these findings appear robust, at least as robust as for many
of the brain structural/functional alterations seen in psy-
chosis. Moreover, we found that there is some, albeit lim-
ited, evidence that non-CNS measures are linked to
symptoms and CNS changes in FEP. This could be taken as
suggesting that psychosis, and by extension schizophrenia,
should be considered a multisystem disorder. However, the
International Classification of Disease-11 2010 Steering
Group discussion paper on multisystem diseases [121],
defined these as “diseases that regularly manifest without
involvement of a common single system and with con-
comitant major involvement of several systems”, and, on
this basis, a disorder such as rheumatoid arthritis would not
be considered multisystem because, while it affects multiple
systems, its predominant manifestation is musculoskeletal.
By the same token, given that psychosis by definition is a
disorder of thought and behavior, it is clear that CNS dys-
function bears the most direct relationship with the clinical
expression of the disorder. This argues against psychosis
being a multisystem disorder. However, this argument is
inherently circular because psychotic disorders are diag-
nosed solely on the basis of mental symptoms. Here, while
the evidence reviewed above goes some way to showing the
magnitude of non-CNS effects is similar, in some cases
larger, than CNS effects, what is currently lacking is robust
evidence that the changes in non-CNS systems have com-
mensurate clinical impacts, for example on functioning,
prognosis, or mortality. Evidence is also needed on the
nature of the relationship between CNS and non-CNS
changes: if non-CNS changes are found to be due to a
common pathoetiology or risk factor (model 3) or lead to
CNS changes (model 1), this could support psychosis being
a multisystem disorder, while finding that non-CNS altera-
tions are secondary to mental symptoms (model 2) would
not. A consequence of this would potentially be that diag-
nostic
and
prognostic
assessment
might
incorporate
assessment of non-CNS organ dysfunction in addition to
assessment of thought and behavior. For example, if the
pathophysiology of FEP includes a hypercortisolemic, pro-
inflammatory state, then a biomarker “fingerprint” of anti-
psychotic naive FEP could conceivably include evidence of
HPA axis dysregulation (e.g., blunted cortisol awakening
response) with raised peripheral cytokines (e.g., IL-6) as
well as relevant measures of CNS function.
Implications and future directions
Further research is required to elucidate whether non-CNS
dysfunction is a cause or a consequence of psychosis.
Longitudinal studies of non-CNS parameters starting in
people at clinical high risk for psychosis and continuing
through development of psychosis is a potential approach,
and has the advantage of including a control group exposed
to the same risk factors (those individuals who do not
develop psychosis), as well as the research advantage that a
number will develop other mental disorders. This group
could help address another key question, which is the
degree to which non-CNS alterations are specific to psy-
chosis or are a common feature of a number of mental
disorders, potentially consistent with a model whereby the
stress of mental illness leads to changes in other systems
[122] (model 2). Other key areas that our review has
highlighted as requiring further work are the degree to
which alterations in non-CNS systems are linked to psy-
chotic symptoms, and other clinical outcomes, and whether
common pathoetiological mechanisms underlie both CNS
and non-CNS alterations.
In terms of clinical practice, the majority of excess
mortality
seen
in
schizophrenia is
due
to
non-CNS
causes, predominantly cardiovascular disease [8], and life
expectancy
in
schizophrenia
has
failed
to
improve
relative to the general population over recent decades [1].
Our findings of cardiometabolic, inflammatory, and HPA
axis
alterations
in
FEP
suggest
that
processes
underlying excess mortality are present early in schizo-
phrenia and other psychotic disorders. One implication for
clinicians is to routinely consider these systems in the
assessment of psychotic disorders. Studies are needed to
determine if addressing non-CNS alterations early reduces
development of physical co-morbidity, and ultimately
reduces mortality in psychotic disorders (see summary box).
Conclusions
Abnormalities in multiple organ systems in addition
to the CNS are seen at onset of psychotic disorders
with similar magnitudes to those seen in the CNS.
While the causal relationship between non-CNS and CNS
alterations remains to be determined, this evidence indicates
that psychosis involves multiple systems from illness onset,
although is not sufficient to define it as a multisystem
disorder.

Box 1 | Limitations
1. First-episode psychosis samples are heterogenous,
including patients with a number of different
psychotic disorders. This limits extrapolation of
these findings to particular disorders, although the
majority of patients included met criteria for
schizophrenia.
2. Included studies often fail to report duration of
untreated psychosis, thus impact of emerging
psychosis on physical health is not quantified.
3. Other serious mental illnesses, e.g., depression,
show similar physiological alterations, therefore
these findings may not be specific to psychosis.
4. According to fail-safe N calculations, certain
findings (e.g., immune and neurophysiological
outcomes) are more robust than others. Outcomes
of certain systems (e.g., HPA axis and CNS
neurochemistry) are limited by small sample sizes.
5. Meta-analysis as a methodology has limitations
when small sample sizes are used, if study
populations are heterogenous, if studies are of
poor quality, and when publication bias exists.
6. Inconsistencies in demonstrating a “biological
gradient” between CNS and non-CNS alterations,
and non-CNS alterations with symptom severity,
limit arguments regarding the non-CNS associa-
tions observed contributing to pathological caus-
ality.
7. Although aimed to be representative, the CNS and
non-CNS systems reviewed were not exhaustive,
and other non-CNS organ systems implicated in
psychotic illness, e.g., the gastrointestinal system
were not discussed. Similarly, indices of CNS
function,
e.g.,
cognitive
function,
were
not
discussed.
Box 2 | Summary of findings and outstanding questions
1. Non-CNS abnormalities occur with similar effect
sizes as CNS abnormalities in FEP.
2. Non-CNS
abnormalities
may
be
a
cause
or
consequence of CNS dysfunction in psychosis or
an epiphenomenon. Clarification of the causal
relationship is required.
3. The predominance of mental symptoms in psy-
chosis currently argues against re-conceptualizing
psychotic disorder as a multisystem disorder, but
this is partly a function of the mental basis of the
diagnosis.
4. Studies are needed to determine if addressing non-
CNS dysfunction from illness onset may contri-
bute to reducing schizophrenia’s excess mortality
rates.
