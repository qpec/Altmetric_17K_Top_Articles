Discharged to Post-Acute Care Facilities

BACKGROUND: Over a quarter of Medicare patients
admitted to the hospital are discharged to post-acute care
(PAC) facilities, but face high rates of readmission. Timing
of readmission may be an important factor in identifying
both risk for and preventability of future readmissions.
This study aims to define factors associated with readmis-
sion within the first week of discharge to PAC facilities
following hospitalization.
DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS: This was a secondary
analysis of the 2011 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Pro-
ject (HCUP) State Inpatient Databases (SID) for California,
Massachusetts, and Florida. The primary outcome was all-
cause readmission within 7 days after hospital discharge,
compared to readmission on days 8–30, for patients aged
65 and older who were discharged from the hospital to a
PAC facility. Predictor variables included patient, index
hospitalization, and hospital characteristics; multivariable
logistic regression was used to identify significant predic-
tors of readmission within 7 days.
RESULTS: There were 81,173 hospital readmissions from
PAC facilities in the first 30 days after hospital discharge.
Patients readmitted within the first week were older, white,
urban, had fewer comorbid illnesses, had a higher number
of previous hospital admissions, and less commonly had
Medicare as a payer. Longer index hospital length of stay
(LOS) was associated with decreased risk of early readmis-
sion (OR 0.74; 95% CI 0.70–0.74 for LOS 4–7 days and
0.60; 95% CI 0.56–0.64 for LOS ≥8 days).
CONCLUSIONS: Shorter length of index hospital stay is
associated with earlier readmission and suggests that for
this comorbid, older population, a shorter hospital stay
may be detrimental. Readmission after 1 week is associ-
ated with increased chronic disease burden, suggesting they
may be associated with factors that are less modifiable.
INTRODUCTION
S
killed nursing and outpatient rehabilitation facilities
that provide post-acute care (PAC) play an important
role in the care of patients who are discharged from the
hospital, but are unable to care for themselves at home.
Over a quarter of Medicare patients admitted to an acute
care hospital in 2011 were discharged to a skilled nursing
or rehabilitation facility.1 The rate of discharge to PAC
facilities is rising2 and the population being discharged to
PAC is older and more vulnerable.3 Hospital readmission
is a critical event for both patients and the healthcare sys-
tem, with extraordinary associated cost.4,5 Between 2000
and 2006, rehospitalizations from PAC accounted for $4.3
billion in Medicare reimbursements.5 Those admitted to a
PAC facility have an increased risk of hospital readmis-
sion;6–11 with over 23% of PAC episodes ending in rehos-
pitalization within 30 days of hospital discharge.5
Identifying which patients are at risk for readmission
and which readmissions are preventable from PAC facili-
ties is sorely needed.12–16 While the pattern of readmis-
sions from PAC facilities is unknown, prior single-site
studies indicate up to one-third of readmissions from PAC
facilities may occur in the first week, indicating early read-
missions may be a sizeable problem.17 Identifying the tim-
ing of readmission, including which readmissions occur
very early in the PAC course, may shed light on these
issues. Since the inception of the Medicare prospective
payment system for hospitals in 1983, there has been a
progressive decline in hospital length of stay (LOS) and
increase in evidence suggesting patients are discharged
with more clinical instability.18–21 Recent work has sug-
gested that for all patients, those discharged to home and
PAC, there are differences in readmissions in the first week

 after discharge from the hospital compared to later read-
missions. Therefore, strategies for targeting early readmis-
sion likely will be different from strategies targeting later
readmission.22 We hypothesize that earlier readmissions
may be more closely linked to in-hospital and transitions
of care processes.
This study aims to define factors associated with read-
mission within the first week of discharge to PAC facilities
following hospitalization, including patient, index hospital-
ization and hospital characteristics.
METHODS
Study Design and Population
A secondary analysis was performed of the 2011 Health-
care Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) State Inpatient
Databases (SID) of California, Massachusetts, and Florida.
This database contains all community hospital admissions,
including all payers, within participating states. These
three states were chosen because they contain longitudinal
data that allows identification of discharge location and
subsequent hospital readmission. Patients were included if
they were age 65 or older, admitted to an acute care hos-
pital, discharged to a PAC facility, and readmitted back to
an acute care hospital within 30 days of index hospitaliza-
tion discharge. They were excluded if they did not have a
readmission, had a readmission after 30 days, or if they
did not have a visitlink variable that allowed for longitudi-
nal analysis. The visitlink variable, which allows for longi-
tudinal analysis, was present for 97.4% of records in CA,
97.7% of records in MA, and 98.8% of records in FL.
This study was exempt by the Colorado Multiple Institu-
tional Review Board.
Predictor and Outcome Variables
The primary outcome was all-cause readmission within
7 days of hospital discharge, compared to readmissions on
days eight through 30 post discharge. Only the first read-
mission within 30 days of discharge was included. If a
patient had a second readmission, this was included as a
new index hospitalization. Predictor patient characteristics
included age, sex, race/ethnicity, urban/rural zip code,
number of hospitalizations in the prior year, primary hos-
pital discharge diagnosis, total number of chronic medical
conditions, and the presence of the following comorbidi-
ties: cancer, congestive heart failure, lung disease, diabetes
and renal failure. In the HCUP database diagnoses are
coded using Clinical Classification Software (CCS), which
is a tool for clustering patient diagnoses and procedures
into clinically meaningful categories.23 Total number of
chronic
medical
conditions
are
calculated
using
the
Chronic Condition Indicator, an HCUP developed soft-
ware tool that categorizes ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes into
chronic or not chronic.24 The chronic condition definitions
are based on ICD-9-CM diagnosis and DRG codes using
Elixhauser Comorbidity software.25 Hospitalization factors
included length of stay, payer source, whether the patient
underwent a major operating room procedure and whether
they were hospitalized for trauma. Operating room proce-
dures and hospitalization for trauma are determined by
ICD-9-CM codes. Hospital characteristics are obtained
from the American Hospital Association Annual Survey of
Hospitals26 and included ownership (federal, for profit,
not for profit), teaching status, size, region within the Uni-
ted States, and urban/rural location. Details of all variable
definitions have been previously described.27
Statistical Analysis
Bivariate comparisons were calculated for predictor vari-
ables between readmissions within 7 days and readmis-
sions occurring on PAC facility days eight through 30.
Descriptive bivariate statistics (means and SDs or column
percentages) were calculated for predictor variables and
P-values were calculated using chi-square for categorical
variables and t-test for continuous variables. Differences
>5.0% were considered clinically relevant, as p-values
have limited utility given the large sample size. Bivariate
comparison was calculated for 10 most common discharge
diagnoses. Readmission by day, between days one and 30,
was graphed. We then used backwards-multivariate logis-
tic regression to identify significant predictors of readmis-
sion on days 8–30, using readmissions within 7 days as
the referent category. The model was fit manually, initially
including all variables. A P-value equal to or greater than
0.25 was used to eliminate variables from the model.
RESULTS
Our final sample included 81,173 hospital readmissions
from PAC facilities in the first 30 days after discharge. Of
these, 21,399 (26%) were in the first 7 days. Distribution
of readmissions by post-hospital day is shown (Figure 1).
Patients within the entire cohort were generally old (mean
age 81), white, urban, chronically ill and used Medicare as
a payer. The index hospital length of stay was >4 days or
more for 75% of readmitted patients (Table 1).
In bivariate analysis, length of index hospital stay was
the only factor with an absolute difference of >5.0%, with
shorter length of stay associated with readmission within a
week. Several other factors showed statistically significant
differences between early and later readmissions (Table 1).
The frequency of the 10 most common discharge diagnoses
are shown (Table 2). The significant associations in the
bivariate analyses were maintained in the final multivariate
analysis. Longer index hospital length of stay was associ-
ated with a decreased risk of early readmission (index LOS
4–7 days OR 0.74 [CI 0.70–0.78] and index LOS >8 days
OR 0.60 [CI 0.56–0.64)]. For every day in the hospital the
risk of readmission within the first 7 days post-hospital
discharge decreased by 2% (OR 0.98 [CI 0.97–0.98]).
Patients with >6 chronic conditions were less likely to
be readmitted within a week (OR 0.85 [CI 0.76–0.91]).
Patients with prior hospitalizations in the past year and
those with private insurance were more likely to be admit-
ted within a week (OR 1.10 [CI 1.09–1.11] and 1.43 [CI
1.32–1.59],
respectively)

 increased risk of early readmission while femur fracture
and urinary tract infection (UTI) were associated with a
decreased risk of early admission. Index hospitalization for
trauma was associated with decrease risk of readmission
within a week. Admission source also impacts the risk of
early readmission, with transfer from another hospital
increasing the risk and transfer from another facility
decreasing that risk. Hospital characteristics also impact
the risk of early readmission, both larger size and teaching
status decrease the risk of early readmission (Table 3.)
CONCLUSION
More than a quarter of all patients readmitted from a
PAC facility are readmitted in the first week; these patients
were more likely to have had a shorter length of index
hospital stay, live in a rural area, to have been admitted
for either MI or pneumonia and to have been discharged
from a small, non-teaching hospital. While patient factors,
such as geographic location, and hospital factors, such as
size and teaching status, may impact risk of readmission,
they are largely non-modifiable. In contrast, the associa-
tion between shorter length of stay and early readmission
may point to an area where targeted intervention or
change in practice could potentially impact rates of read-
mission. Prior work has shown an association between
decreasing LOS and rising rates of discharge to PAC facili-
ties for some diagnoses, including pneumonia, suggesting a
“substitution” of PAC for a prolonged inpatient stay.3
This is the first study to examine the association between
timing of hospital readmission and hospital length of stay
among patients discharged to PAC facilities, which has sig-
nificant implications for both hospitals and PAC facilities
when thinking about how to reduce readmissions. Our
results suggest that hospital and the PAC site are closely
interconnected, thus future interventions targeting early
readmission should focus on in-hospital care prior to dis-
charge and transitional care, while targeting later readmis-
sions (day eight or later) may involve other factors such as
chronic illness.
Our finding that shorter hospital length of stay is asso-
ciated with earlier readmission is consistent with prior
work28 and suggests that for this frail, older population, a
quicker discharge may be detrimental. Evidence suggests
that length of stay shortened after implementation of
Medicare’s post-acute care transfer policy and this was
associated with increased rates of readmission.28 In addi-
tion, average length of hospital stay for patients discharged
to PAC has decreased as rates of discharge to PAC have
risen;2 and these changes have occurred as hospitalist care
becomes increasingly common.29–32
Our results may support the theory that patients may
be discharged “quicker and sicker.”20,21 The population
included in our study have an overall high rate of comor-
bid illness and high risk of readmission; we speculate that
those with a shorter length of stay either were more
acutely ill at time of hospital discharge or had less time in
the hospital to manage their decompensated chronic con-
ditions, leading to higher rates of early readmission. In
contrast, those with a longer LOS may have been had less
acutely ill at time of hospital discharge and/or had better
initial management of their decompensated chronic ill-
nesses. However, this group remains at high daily risk of
readmission due to the cumulative complications from
their comorbid illness, perhaps eventually leading to a
later readmission. Multiple factors likely contribute to this
phenomenon
including
changes
in
reimbursement,28
changes in provider practices, including hospitalist uncer-
tainty about the role of PAC facilities and lack of under-
standing about the limits of care that can be provided
within that environment,29–32 and changes in patient pop-
ulation characteristics.3,33 An association between clinical

 instability and risk of readmission has previously been
established for patients admitted with pneumonia and hip
fracture,
although
these
studies
were
not
limited
to
patients discharged to PAC facilities.18,19,34 One large
prospective study showed that patients discharged to PAC
facilities are more likely to be clinically unstable at dis-
charge,
although
they
did
not
find
any
association
between hospital length of stay and clinical instability at
discharge.18 Future work should investigate whether, for
older adults in particular, a shorter hospital stay could
make it more likely that they are discharged while still
clinically unstable or before the effects of medication
changes have been observed, putting them at risk for
returning to the hospital.
Contrary to our work, Graham et al. found that a
longer length of stay was associated with early readmission

 but not later readmission for patients discharged to home
and PAC from a single large urban teaching hospital.22
There are differences between our study populations that
may account for this, ours were older and discharged only
to PAC facilities. It is likely that the specific population in
our study is at unique risk of adverse outcomes related to
short length of stay, due to age and frailty. It is notable
that in Graham’s study hospital discharge after 6 p.m. was
associated with early readmission, perhaps indicating that
these patients could benefit from another hospital day.22
Future work is needed to confirm the association between
length of stay and early readmission, as well as exploring
the underlying causes for this association including clinical
instability at discharge.
Complex medical comorbidity has previously been
found to be a risk factor for hospital readmission follow-
ing discharge to PAC.12 Our data support the findings of
prior work, in that a higher rate of comorbidity is associ-
ated with a risk of later readmission.22 Perhaps, the associ-
ation between comorbid illness and later readmission
suggests that these readmissions are less likely to be related
to clinical instability at the time of discharge but rather
are related to the cumulative risk of complications from
their chronic illnesses over time following admission.
Therefore, for these patients, interventions to address in
hospital or discharge factors may be less likely to impact
the rates of readmission. The primary index diagnosis was
associated with the likelihood of early versus late readmis-
sion, with hip fracture and urinary tract infection associ-
ated
with
later
readmission
and
MI
and
pneumonia
associated with early readmission. Hospital LOS has previ-
ously been shown to have decreased over time, with MI
and pneumonia showing the greatest reduction in LOS,
but without an association between LOS and readmis-
sion.33 Further study could identify if these diagnosis
related differences in readmission risk are more related to
care process factors or patient characteristics. Early read-
missions were more likely to occur from small, rural, for
profit and non-teaching hospitals. This suggests that there

 are care process, system and perhaps, cultural, factors that
impact the likelihood of returning to the hospital. Social
factors, including race, income and neighborhood socioe-
conomic status, have previously been shown to influence
risk of readmission, but have not been studied in popula-
tions discharged to PAC only.35–37
Results of our study should be interpreted in the con-
text of the data analyzed. The choice to compare readmis-
sions within the first week to admissions on days 8–30
was chosen based on clinical judgment, but analysis using

different
results.
Important
factors
that
impact the risk of readmission including functional status
and psychosocial factors are not included in HCUP data-
bases. Additionally, we had very little data about the PAC
facilities to which patients were discharged, which likely
vary in their care practices. We do not have information
about discharge medications, which have been shown to
be of critical importance to risk of adverse events after dis-
charge.38–40 Nor do we have information about care pro-
cesses during hospitalization and between the hospital and
PAC facility. We were unable to assess the appropriateness
of early versus late readmissions. Lastly, although this was
a large sample, data from only three states was included,
which could limit generalizability. Strengths include large
sample size from three large states including all payers and
representative of a sizeable portion of the US population
with detailed data about the patients, hospitalizations and
hospitals.
Among patients discharged from the hospital to PAC,
shorter length of stay is a risk factor for early readmission.
We suggest that interventions, which focus on in-hospital
and transitional care processes to ensure a patient is ready
for hospital discharge, may hold promise in reducing early
readmissions. Future work to reduce potentially avoidable
readmissions in this population should take these differ-
ences into account.
