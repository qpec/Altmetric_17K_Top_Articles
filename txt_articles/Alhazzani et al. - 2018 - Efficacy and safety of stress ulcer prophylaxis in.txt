Abstract 
Purpose: Stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) is commonly prescribed in the intensive care unit. However, data from 
systematic reviews and conventional meta‑analyses are limited by imprecision and restricted to direct comparisons. 
We conducted a network meta‑analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to examine the safety and efficacy of drugs 
available for SUP in critically ill patients.
Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library Central Register of Controlled Trials through 
April 2017 for randomized controlled trials that examined the efficacy and safety of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), his‑
tamine‑2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs), and sucralfate for SUP in critically ill patients. No date or language restrictions 
were applied. Data on study characteristics, methods, outcomes, and risk of bias were abstracted by two reviewers.
Results: Of 96 potentially eligible studies, we included 57 trials enrolling 7293 patients. The results showed that PPIs 
are probably more effective for preventing clinically important gastrointestinal bleeding (CIB) than H2RAs [odds ratio 
(OR) 0.38; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.20, 0.73], sucralfate (OR 0.30; 95% CI 0.13, 0.69), and placebo (OR 0.24; 
95% CI 0.10, 0.60) (all moderate quality evidence). There were no convincing differences among H2RA, sucralfate, and 
placebo. PPIs probably increase the risk of developing pneumonia compared with H2RAs (OR 1.27; 95% CI 0.96, 1.68), 
sucralfate (OR 1.65; 95% CI 1.20, 2.27), and placebo (OR 1.52; 95% CI 0.95, 2.42) (all moderate quality). Mortality is prob‑
ably similar across interventions (moderate quality). Estimates of baseline risks of bleeding varied significantly across 
studies, and only one study reported on Clostridium difficile infection. Definitions of pneumonia varied considerably. 
Most studies on sucralfate predate pneumonia prevention strategies.
Conclusions: Our results provide moderate quality evidence that PPIs are the most effective agents in preventing 
CIB, but they may increase the risk of pneumonia. The balance of benefits and harms leaves the routine use of SUP 
open to question.

Introduction
Stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) is usual practice in inten-
sive care units (ICUs) worldwide. Across North America, 
Europe, and Australia, most patients with risk factors 
receive SUP during their ICU stay [1, 2]. A survey of 58 
ICUs in North America showed that proton pump inhibi-
tors (PPIs) are the most commonly used agents, followed 
by histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs); none of 
the participating centers used sucralfate or anti-acids 
[1]. A recent survey of 97 centers in Europe, Australia, 
and Canada yielded similar findings [3]. These practices 
reflect the results of systematic reviews of randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) suggesting that H2RAs, com-
pared with sucralfate or no prophylaxis, reduce the risk 
of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding without increasing the 
risk of pneumonia, and that PPIs in comparison with 
H2RAs further reduce the risk of clinically important 
GI bleeding (CIB) without increasing pneumonia risk. 
The recommendations of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign 
guidelines are consistent with these results [4–6].
Nevertheless, concerns have grown regarding the mag-
nitude of benefit of SUP, as well as the safety of acid sup-
pressive therapy with respect to pneumonia, Clostridium 
difficile infection, cardiovascular events, and mortality 
[7]. Conventional meta-analyses are restricted to head-
to-head comparisons, and therefore cannot inform on 
the relative merit of candidate therapies that have not 
been compared directly. By including indirect compari-
sons, network meta-analyses can not only address this 
limitation but also—by combining direct and indirect 
estimates—improve precision [8].
We therefore conducted a network meta-analysis 
addressing the relative impact of SUP with PPI, H2RAs, 
sucralfate, and placebo (or no prophylaxis) on overt CIB, 
pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, and death.
Methods
We adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for System-
atic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Extension 
statement for reporting network meta-analyses [Elec-
tronic Supplemental Material (ESM) Table 1] [9].
Data sources and searches
To identify RCTs comparing PPIs, H2RAs and sucralfate 
with one another and with placebo or no SUP in adult 
critically ill patients, we searched Cochrane CENTRAL, 
MEDLINE, and EMBASE from inception to April 2017 
(ESM Table 2). We updated the search strategy for two 
systematic reviews of PPIs versus H2RA, and PPI versus 
placebo [6, 7], and conducted a complete search of the 
literature for other comparisons. We applied no restric-
tion based on dose or route of drug administration or on 
language of publication. Eligible studies reported on at 
least one of the following: CIB, overt GI bleeding, pneu-
monia, mortality, and Clostridium difficile infection.
Study selection
Working in pairs, six reviewers screened citations and 
abstracts in duplicate and independently. The same pairs 
of reviewers evaluated all references judged potentially 
relevant for full-text eligibility.
Data extraction and quality assessment
Reviewers abstracted data in duplicate using piloted 
forms, and collected information on population demo-
graphics (age, sex, critical illness severity measure, ICU 
type, risk factors for bleeding), methodology and risk 
of bias, intervention and comparator (drug name, dose, 
route of administration, and duration of exposure), and 
outcomes. A third reviewer adjudicated disagreements 
not resolved by discussion.
We predefined CIB as evidence of upper GI bleed-
ing with any of the following: significant hemodynamic 
changes not explained by other causes, need for transfu-
sion of more than two units of blood, significant decrease 
in hemoglobin level, evidence of bleeding on GI endos-
copy, or need for surgery to control the bleeding. Overt 
bleeding was defined as evidence of upper GI bleeding 
(hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, or coffee-grounds 
emesis or aspirate) regardless to other clinical findings. 
If an RCT only reported CIB, we considered all events 
as overt GI bleeding events. All studies used definitions 
consistent with those we prespecified.
We included pneumonia events in the ICU, whether 
or not they were associated with mechanical ventilation, 
accepting the definition used in each trial. We defined 
Clostridium difficile infection as a combination of clinical 
symptoms and a positive microbiologic test.
In duplicate, for each trial, reviewers assessed the 
risk of bias using the instrument recommended by the 
Cochrane Collaboration [10]. We provided a judgment 
of risk of bias as low (bias is not present or unlikely to 
alter the results seriously), unclear, or high (bias may 
seriously alter the results) for each of the following 
items: sequence generation, allocation sequence con-
cealment, blinding of participants and clinicians, blind-
ing of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data 
assessment, and other bias. The overall risk of bias for 
each included trial was categorized as low if the risk of 
bias was low in all domains, unclear if the risk of bias 
was unclear in one or more domains and with no judg-
ment of high risk of bias, or high if the risk of bias was 
high in one or more domains. We resolved disagree-
ments by discussion.

Statistical analysis
Using a frequentist framework, we performed five 
random effects network meta-analyses, one for each 
outcome, calculating odds ratios (OR) and their cor-
responding 95% confidence intervals (CI). To evaluate 
inconsistency, we fit both a consistency and an inconsist-
ency model for each outcome [11]. Using a node-split-
ting procedure [12], we calculated direct and indirect 
estimates for each pair of treatments. We calculated the 
frequentist analogue of the surface under the cumula-
tive ranking curve (SUCRA) for each treatment (here-
after referred to as the SUCRA) [13]. All analyses were 
performed using the package mvmeta in Stata/IC 13.1 
for Windows [14]. We assessed coherence (consistency) 
between direct and indirect estimates by performing 
node splitting and test for coherence [11]. We calcu-
lated the absolute treatment effect [risk difference (RD)] 
using the median event rate in the placebo arm in all tri-
als for both clinically important GI bleeding and pneu-
monia outcomes. The median event rate in the placebo 
group was 2.1 and 6% for CIB and pneumonia outcomes; 
respectively.
Assessment of quality of evidence
For each outcome and each direct or indirect compari-
son, we applied the Grading of Recommendations Assess-
ment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach 
to assess the quality of evidence [15, 16]. For rating 
quality in each indirect comparison, we focused on the 
first-order loop with the smallest variance which, there-
fore, contributed the most to the estimate of effect. We 
assigned quality of the indirect comparison according to 
the contributing direct comparison (of the two) within 
each first-order loop with the lowest of the quality rat-
ing. We considered rating down the quality of evidence 
further when intransitivity (clinical heterogeneity) was 
present, analogous to rating down the quality of evidence 
in direct comparison meta-analysis for indirectness [17]. 
For network estimates of any paired comparison, we 
chose the highest quality rating amongst the direct and 
indirect comparisons. We rated down quality in the net-
work estimate if incoherence between direct and indirect 
estimates was present. In a network meta-analysis, inco-
herence represents the differences between the direct 
and indirect estimates of effect, while heterogeneity is 
the differences in estimates of effect across studies that 
assessed the same comparison [17].

Results
Literature search
The initial search yielded 4139 citations; 93 proved 
potentially eligible after reviewing abstracts, of which 57 
trials from 58 reports, representing 7293 patients, ulti-
mately proved eligible (Fig. 1, ESM Table 2) [18–75].
Study characteristics
Of the 57 eligible trials, 18 compared PPIs with H2RAs; 
two, PPIs with sucralfate; four, PPIs with placebo; 18, 
H2RAs with sucralfate; 21, H2RAs with placebo; and six, 
sucralfate with placebo (ESM Figs. S1–S4). Trial sample 
size ranged from 28 to 1200 patients. Different doses, 
routes of administration, and durations of prophylaxis 
were used for PPIs and H2RAs across the trials (ESM 
Tables 3, 4).
Risk of bias
The risk of bias was high in 30 trials, low in 16 trials, and 
unclear in 11 trials (ESM Table 5).
Quality of evidence
Direct comparisons often suffered from limitations 
of risk of bias and imprecision. Regarding transitivity, 
although the intervention dosing and route varied across 
trials, the variation was not large enough to warrant con-
cerns regarding intransitivity.  Details can be found in 
Table 1 and ESM Table 5. For all comparisons across all 
outcomes, there was no statistical evidence of incoher-
ence. Although no incoherence was detected by statistical 
testing, the test for incoherence could be underpowered; 
therefore, we further assessed incoherence by visually 
inspecting the direct and indirect estimates for any obvi-
ous differences. We considered problematic incoherence 
present for two comparisons based on visual inspection 
of direct and indirect estimates (Table 1).
The quality of evidence of network estimates for vari-
ous comparisons across all outcomes ranged from low to 
moderate (Table 1).
Clinical outcomes
Clinically important GI bleeding
Thirty-one RCTs (5283 patients) reported on CIB [21, 25, 
26, 30–32, 35, 36, 38–40, 42–44, 46–48, 57–59, 61, 63–67, 
69–72, 74]. For three comparisons, the network estimate 
provided moderate-quality evidence with a CI excluding 
1.0: PPIs versus H2RAs (OR 0.38; 95% CI 0.20, 0.73), PPIs 
versus no prophylaxis or placebo (OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.10, 
0.60), and PPIs versus  sucralfate (OR 0.30; 95% CI 0.13, 
0.69). (Table 1, Fig. 2a). The SUCRA statistic showed that 
 4
PPIs ranked first, followed by H2RAs, sucralfate, and pla-
cebo (ESM Table 6, Fig. 3a).
Pneumonia
Thirty-five RCTs (5452 patients) reported on pneumo-
nia [18, 19, 21, 22, 25, 26, 28–30, 32, 36, 37, 39–42, 44, 
46–49, 51–54, 57, 58, 60, 61, 65–68, 70, 71]. PPIs ranked 
last compared with other interventions in terms of risk 
of pneumonia (ESM Table 7, Fig. 3b). Network meta-
analysis results showed that PPIs and H2RAs probably 
increase the risk of pneumonia compared with sucral-
fate (OR 1.65; 95% CI 1.20, 2.27; moderate quality and 
OR 1.30; 95% CI 1.08, 1.58; moderate quality, respec-
tively) but not compared with placebo or no prophylaxis 
(OR 1.09; 95% CI 0.72, 1.66; low quality). PPIs probably 
increase pneumonia compared with H2RAs (OR 1.27; 
95% CI 0.96, 1.68; moderate quality), and no prophylaxis 
(OR 1.52; 95% CI 0.95, 2.42; moderate quality). H2RAs 
probably have no impact on pneumonia relative to pla-
cebo (Table 1, Fig. 2b).
Mortality
Thirty-six RCTs (5498 patients) reported on mortality 
[18, 19, 21, 23, 25, 26, 28, 29, 31, 34–40, 44, 46–51, 53, 56, 
59–62, 64–66, 68–71, 75]. The results provide moderate-
quality evidence that there is no difference between any 
of the management options in terms of all-cause mortal-
ity (Table 1, ESM Fig. S5). Given that all estimates were 
similar and approximated no effect, we did not calculate 
SUCRA values for the mortality outcome.
Clostridium difficile infection
Only one trial reported Clostridium difficile infection; 
therefore, we could not provide a network estimate for 
this outcome [66].
Overt GI bleeding
For overt GI bleeding, 49 studies (6662 patients) proved 
eligible [18, 20, 21, 23–36, 38–40, 42–75]. PPIs were 
superior to H2RAs (OR 0.34; 95% CI 0.19, 0.60, moderate 
quality), sucralfate (OR 0.35; 95% CI 0.18, 0.71, moder-
ate quality), and placebo or no prophylaxis (OR 0.14; 95% 
CI 0.07, 0.28, moderate quality). H2RAs were superior to 
no prophylaxis in reducing risk of overt GI bleeding (OR 
0.42; 95% CI 0.28, 0.63, moderate quality), but not sucral-
fate (OR 1.05; 95% CI 0.69, 1.59, moderate quality) (ESM 
Table 8 and Fig. S6). PPIs ranked first in reducing overt 
bleeding compared with other agents (ESM Table 9, Fig. 
S7).
Discussion
In this network meta-analysis, we included 57 RCTs 
enrolling 7293 patients comparing various SUP strate-
gies. SUP with either PPIs or H2RAs likely reduces CIB 
(moderate quality evidence) (Table 1) relative to not 
using prophylaxis, and PPIs are likely superior to both 
H2RAs and sucralfate. Given the current estimates of the 
frequency of CIB, the magnitude of benefit is not large.
On the other hand, PPIs likely result in a higher risk 
of pneumonia than other prophylaxis regimens or no 
prophylaxis (moderate-quality evidence) (Table 1). These 
results are consistent with indirect evidence from multi-
ple observational studies that have reported an increased 
risk of community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia in 
patients using PPIs [76–78]. Further direct supporting 
evidence comes from a retrospective observational study 
that reported a higher risk of pneumonia in critically ill 
patients on PPIs than for those on H2RAs in the ICU 
[79].
Low-quality evidence suggests that sucralfate may 
reduce pneumonia in comparison with placebo. This 
finding—together with the moderate-quality evidence 
of a lower pneumonia risk with sucralfate than PPIs—is 
consistent with prior physiologic and microbiologic data 
establishing the antibacterial effect of sucralfate, inde-
pendently of the gastric pH level [80–82]. If the point 
estimate for pneumonia is accurate, PPIs relative to no 
SUP would result in a substantial increase in pneumonia.

cess of selecting eligible studies. Overall, we included 57 randomized 
clinical trials from 58 reports

The use of indirect comparisons within this network 
meta-analysis adds additional information beyond the 
multiple direct comparison meta-analyses that have com-
pared PPIs, H2RAs, and sucralfate with placebo and with 
one another [6, 7, 83–87]. First, moderate-quality indirect 
evidence supports the previously observed effect of PPIs 
decreasing CIB relative to no SUP and relative to other 
agents (Table 1). Second, our results provide additional 
moderate quality evidence in support of the hypothesis 
that PPIs may increase the incidence of pneumonia rela-
tive to H2RAs, to sucralfate, and to no SUP. Prior system-
atic reviews were limited by imprecision and by the small 
number of studies for some direct comparisons, such 
as PPIs and placebo. Network meta-analytic techniques 
allowed us to generate more reliable estimates for these 
comparisons, particularly for the pneumonia outcome.

Conventional meta-analyses are restricted to direct com-
parisons and do not consider indirect evidence in situa-
tions where evidence is sparse.
We have thus far focused on estimates of relative 
effects. In considering the implications of our results for 
use of SUP, consideration of absolute effects is crucial. 
The best estimates of the impact of PPIs on CIB suggest 
an absolute reduction of 1.6% relative to placebo, with a 
CI of 0.8–1.9% (Table 2). Similar estimates for pneumo-
nia suggest an absolute increase of 3.1%, with a CI rang-
ing from 0.3% fewer events to 8.5% more events. These 
estimates raise serious questions about the net benefit of 
PPIs for SUP.
The strengths of this work include a comprehensive 
search, duplicate review of trial eligibility and risk of bias, 
and adherence to the PRISMA guidelines for reporting 
network meta-analyses (ESM Table 1) [9]. We adopted 
a frequentist (likelihood maximization) rather than a 
Bayesian approach to combine the results, avoiding issues 
relating to pre-specification of variance [88]. We used the 
node-splitting technique to provide estimates of indirect 
evidence, and applied the GRADE approach to assess the

quality of evidence for each outcome, including specifica-
tion of quality of direct, indirect, and network estimates 
[15]. To enhance the generalizability of our results, we 
included studies of patients with a wide spectrum of crit-
ical illness. We used best current estimates of effect for 
baseline risk to derive likely absolute effects of SUP on 
serious bleeding and pneumonia.
This study also has limitations. Although most RCTs 
used microbiological, radiological and clinical criteria to 
diagnose pneumonia, there was considerable variation 
in definitions [89]. Estimates of baseline risk vary appre-
ciably across trials. In addition, most trials examining 
sucralfate predate the effective pneumonia prevention 
strategies, attenuating the applicability of these results 
to current practice. Only one trial addressed Clostrid-
ium difficile infection, which is important given a recent 
30,000-patient retrospective observational study suggest-
ing that PPIs may increase the risk of Clostridium dif-
ficile colitis [90]. Furthermore, the majority of trials did 
not report on nutritional management, which limited 
our ability to examine the effect of enteral nutrition as an 
effect modifier.
The universal use of SUP should be reconsidered in 
the light of uncertain net benefit. Two large multicenter 
RCTs are ongoing, the SUP-ICU in Europe (clinicaltrials.
gov registration NCT02467621) and the REVISE Trial in 
North America, Australia, and Saudi Arabia. The results 
of these trials will provide further information about the 
safety of withholding stress ulcer prophylaxis in the ICU.
Conclusion
Our results provide moderate-quality evidence that PPIs 
are the most effective prophylactic strategy for SUP, with 
an absolute risk reduction in CIB relative to no prophy-
laxis of 1.6%. The benefit of PPIs must, however, be 
weighed against the risk of pneumonia, and possibly of 
Clostridium difficile infection. Moderate-quality evidence 
provides a best estimate of the increase in pneumonia 
with PPIs relative to no prophylaxis of over 3%. These 
estimates raise serious questions regarding the net bene-
fit of SUP and its widespread use. The findings of this net-
work meta-analysis can inform clinicians who consider 
the local incidence of CIB, pneumonia, and Clostridium 
difficile infection when deciding on uniform, selective, or 
sparing use of SUP in critically ill patients.
