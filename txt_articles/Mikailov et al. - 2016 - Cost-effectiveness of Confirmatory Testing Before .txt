Cost-effectiveness of Confirmatory Testing Before Treatment
of Onychomycosis
Anar Mikailov, MD; Jeffrey Cohen, MD; Cara Joyce, PhD; Arash Mostaghimi, MD, MPA
IMPORTANCE Onychomycosis is the most common disease of the nail in adults. International
guidelines urge health care professionals to perform confirmatory diagnostic testing before
initiating systemic therapy. This approach was determined to be cost-effective in studies from
the late 1990s but has not been evaluated more recently. The effect of testing on the costs of
efinaconazole, 10%, topical solution treatment is unknown.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the cost and potential harm associated with 3 approaches to
onychomycosis evaluation before treatment with oral terbinafine or efinaconazole, 10%.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A decision analysis that compared the costs of
3 onychomycosis management algorithms based on recently published data of test statistics,
disease prevalence, and relevant costs: (1) empirical therapy without confirmatory testing,
(2) pretreatment confirmatory testing with potassium hydroxide (KOH) stain followed by
periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) evaluation if KOH testing is negative, and (3) pretreatment testing
with PAS. There was no direct patient evaluation. Selection of included studies was based on
outcome variables and the quality of study design. The study was conducted from April 1,
2014, to September 1, 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomes included direct cost of onychomycosis
testing and therapy and cost to avoid harm when treating patients with oral terbinafine.
RESULTS At a disease prevalence of 75%, per-patient cost savings of empirical terbinafine
therapy without confirmatory testing was $47 compared with the KOH screening model and
$135 compared with PAS testing. The cost of testing necessary to prevent a single case of
clinically relevant liver toxic effects related to terbinafine at a prevalence of 75% was between
$18.2 million and $43.7 million for KOH screening and between $37.6 million and $90.2
million for PAS testing. At a prevalence of 75%, KOH screening and PAS testing before
treatment with efinaconazole, 10%, saved $272 and $406 per patient per nail, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These results show that empirical treatment with terbinafine
for patients with suspected onychomycosis is more cost-effective than confirmatory testing
across all prevalence of disease, with minimal effect on patient safety. In contrast,
confirmatory testing before treatment with efinaconazole, 10%, is associated with reduced
costs. Blanket recommendations for confirmatory testing before systemic therapy should be
reconsidered and replaced with recommendations tailored to specific therapies.

O
nychomycosis is the most common disease of the nail
in adults, with a prevalence of 7% to 14% of individu-
als in North America.1-4 Given the high prevalence of
the disease and the potential for clinical misdiagnosis, sev-
eral international guidelines and reviews have been devel-
oped to help health care professionals diagnose and manage
potential cases of onychomycosis.1,5-7 Although specific guide-
lines vary, one common thread is the recommendation to his-
tologically confirm the diagnosis of onychomycosis before ini-
tiating systemic therapy.
The American Academy of Dermatology’
s7 contribution to
theAmericanBoardofInternalMedicine’
sChoosingWiselycam-
paign reinforces the recommendation for confirmatory testing
of onychomycosis before systemic therapy in an effort to mini-
mize wasteful or harmful care. This recommendation is based
inpartonastudyconductedin1999byMehreganandGee6that
compared the cost-effectiveness of empirical therapy vs con-
firmatory testing in patients with suspected onychomycosis;
their results favored confirmatory testing. Although the cost of
onychomycosis testing and treatment has changed in the past
15 years, this paradigm has not been reevaluated. For ex-
ample, a full 12-week course of terbinafine cost $547 in 1999
compared with $10 today.6,8,9 Simultaneously, the introduc-
tion of efinaconazole, 10%, topical solution presents a novel
high-cost topical treatment option for patients.
The goal of this study was to perform a decision analysis
to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and safety implications of
empirical onychomycosis therapy with oral terbinafine or topi-
cal efinaconazole, 10%, vs confirmatory testing with periodic
acid–Schiff (PAS) or sequential in-office potassium hydroxide
(KOH) screening with subsequent PAS testing if KOH testing
is negative.
Methods
This study was deemed exempt by the Partners Healthcare in-
stitutional review board. The study was conducted from April
1, 2014, to September 1, 2015.
Diagnostic and Treatment Approaches
for Decision Tree Design
This decision analysis was based on data from previously pub-
lished literature. PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Ovid
MEDLINE were searched from January 1996 (the date of ter-
binafine availability in the United States) to March 30, 2014,
using the following search terms: onychomycosis, onychomy-
cosis treatment, onychomycosis testing, onychomycosis testing
sensitivity, onychomycosis cost-effectiveness, and terbinafine
safety. References of key articles were manually searched to
find additional articles. Statistics on terbinafine-induced liver
injury were based on data from the National Library of Medi-
cine liver toxicity database.10
After an initial literature review, we chose to compare
3 pragmatic approaches to diagnosing and/or treating sus-
pected onychomycosis: (1) immediate treatment for all pa-
tients clinically suspected to have onychomycosis (ie, with-
out testing), (2) in-clinic KOH screening followed by treatment
for all patients with KOH-positive results and PAS testing for
those with KOH-negative results before treatment, and (3) PAS
testing before treatment. Models 2 and 3 were chosen based
on multiple studies and international guidelines that recom-
mend the use of PAS for out-of-office testing and in-clinic KOH
screening as the least costly, most broadly available in-office
procedure.1,5,11-16
Assigning Cost and Classification Probabilities
To determine the most accurate statistics of in-clinic KOH and
PAS testing, 2 authors (A. Mikailov and A. Mostaghimi) re-
viewed all identified articles and eliminated those that were
not prospective trials in which outcomes included the sensi-
tivity and specificity of in-clinic KOH and PAS test results. Only
2 prospective studies13,14 included outcome data for the sen-
sitivity and specificity of both diagnostic tests. The present
studyusedteststatisticsfromthetrialbyWeinbergetal13given
the high prevalence (99%) of onychomycosis in the trial by
Haghani et al.14 The test statistics from Weinberg et al dem-
onstrated in-clinic KOH sensitivity and specificity values of
80% and 72%, respectively, and PAS sensitivity and specific-
ity values of 92% and 72%, respectively. Given the lack of data
regarding the effect of KOH testing on sequential PAS testing,
we assumed in our model that the performance of PAS was in-
dependent of KOH results.
The prevalence of onychomycosis in North America is es-
timated to be between 7% and 14%.1-4 In populations that seek
carefornaildystrophy,theprevalenceofonychomycosisis65%
to 95%.6,12-15 Given the potential for the wide variability in dis-
ease prevalence, we modeled cost analyses for prevalences of
30%, 60%, and 90%. In addition, we performed a cost analy-
sis at a prevalence of 75% based on findings from a recent
study17 of patients who had confirmatory testing after a clini-
cal diagnosis of onychomycosis.
A decision tree was created for the 3 management ap-
proaches for suspected onychomycosis (Figure). The cost of a
12-week course of terbinafine, 250 mg/d, was assessed at
Walmart Stores, Inc,8 and Target Corporation.9 Costs for efi-
naconazole, 10%, therapy were based on recommended treat-
ment of 1 nail (1 drop/d for 48 weeks) with mean out-of-
pocket cost obtained through telephone calls by one of us
(A. Mikailov) to 4 national retail pharmacies: Walmart Stores,
Inc (March 12, 2015); Target Corporation (March 13, 2015); CVS
Pharmacy (March 12, 2015); and Rite Aid Corporation (March
13, 2015) (Table 1).
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services website pro-
vided national reimbursement values for clinical laboratory
testing and physician fee schedules.18,19 The cost for in-office
KOH testing was based on the clinical laboratory fee schedule
for Current Procedural Terminology code 87220, and the cost
forPAStestingwasbasedonacombinationofprofessionalcosts
for trimming the nails (G0127), pathologist examination
(88302), and staining the nail (88312).18,19
Alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransfer-
ase laboratory codes were included in cost analyses of labo-
ratory monitoring. The final cost calculations were based on

Decision Analysis
Decision tree analysis was performed using TreePlan Pro
software.20 Correct treatment was defined as a full treatment
courseforpatientswithonychomycosis(true-positives)andno
treatment for those without onychomycosis (true-negatives).
The percentage of individuals who received the correct treat-
ment was calculated for disease prevalence ranging from 0%
to 100% by each of the 3 management pathways (eFigure in the
Supplement). The cost of testing to avoid 1 incorrect diagnosis
was calculated for each treatment plan at prevalences of 30%,
60%, and 90% (Table 2). We evaluated the cost of testing re-
quired to avoid liver injury based on the estimated incidence
of terbinafine-related liver injury from the National Library of
Medicine liver toxic effects database (Table 3).10
Results
Costs of Onychomycosis Therapy
The calculated costs of treatment and monitoring (liver en-
zymes) associated with a 12-week course of terbinafine for
1 patient was $53 (Table 1). A full course of efinaconazole, 10%,
therapy for 1 nail was $2307. The costs of confirmatory test-
ing were $6 for KOH and $148 for PAS.
Costs for immediate treatment with either drug re-
mained constant since no pretreatment testing was per-
formed, whereas the net costs of KOH and PAS testing varied
depending on prevalence (Table 4). The cost for immediate
treatment with terbinafine was lower than the cost for either
of the testing strategies across all disease prevalence. The cost
of KOH testing decreased from $123 to $92 per patient as the
prevalence increased from 30% to 90%. In contrast, per-
patient cost for PAS testing increased from $172 to $193 as the
prevalence increased. At a prevalence of 75%, the cost of the
KOH screening pathway was $100 ($47 more than empirical
therapy),andthecostofthePAStestingpathwaywas$188($135
more than empirical therapy).
Incontrast,testingbeforetreatmentwithefinaconazole,10%,
was associated with cost savings across all disease prevalence,
with higher savings at a lower prevalence. The net costs of KOH

was $1901 ($406 less than empirical therapy).
Correctly Managed Treatment
We determined the proportion of patients who received cor-
rect treatment for each decision tree pathway at various dis-
ease prevalence states (Table 4). In all 3 models, the number of
patients who received correct treatment increased with preva-
lence.Ataprevalenceofapproximately95%,the3diseaseman-

of inappropriate therapy (ie, treatment for individuals without

Cost to Avoid Liver Failure With Terbinafine
The Clinical and Research Information on Drug-Induced Liver
Injury Database10 (a subgroup of the National Library of Medi-
cine) calculates the incidence of clinically apparent liver in-
juryduetoterbinafinetobe1caseper50 000to120 000treat-
ments. Based on the incidence of severe liver injury and cost
per patient of testing to avoid a false-positive case, the over-
all combined cost to avoid clinically apparent liver injury at a
prevalence of 75% was between $18.2 million and $43.7 mil-
lion using the KOH screening pathway and between $37.6 mil-
lion and $90.2 million for the PAS testing pathway (Table 3).
Discussion
The value of confirmatory testing before initiation of treat-
ment for onychomycosis is largely driven by drug costs. Con-
firmatory diagnostic testing before initiating systemic terbi-
nafine for clinically diagnosed onychomycosis is consistently
more expensive than treating all clinically suspected cases of
onychomycosis over a wide range of prevalence (30%-90%).
Although adverse events from inappropriate treatment with
terbinafine for patients without onychomycosis is a concern,
our analysis demonstrates that current testing paradigms cre-
ate a substantial cost burden and require between $9.62 mil-
lion and $233.89 million in testing costs to avoid 1 case of clini-
cally apparent liver injury.
Although adverse effects are less of a concern with efina-
conazole, confirmatory testing before treatment yields a sub-
stantial reduction in cost, with savings of $110 to $1070 per nail
depending on the testing strategy and disease prevalence.
These savings multiply substantially with the number of nails
treated.
Our findings provide a relevant and necessary update to
a prevailing paradigm that urges confirmatory diagnostic test-
ing before initiating systemic therapy for onychomycosis.1,5-7
The most recent US guidelines7 were published as part of the
original Choosing Wisely–American Academy of Dermatol-
ogy campaign and are based on studies published more than
10 years ago.5,6 Our analysis demonstrates that changes in the
costs of therapy and monitoring over the past 15 years chal-

Experience with terbinafine in the United States over the
past 2 decades has defined a relatively benign adverse effect
profile and very few clinically relevant toxic injuries. We now
know that it is highly unlikely that any given patient will have
significant harm from terbinafine exposure.10 Development of

treatment.21
Confirmatory testing for onychomycosis still has a place
inclinicalcare.Theemergenceofefinaconazole,10%,asanovel
and expensive agent for the treatment of onychomycosis re-
inforces the value of confirmatory testing in an era of cost-
containment.
These conclusions are most valid when the pretest prob-
ability of onychomycosis is highest. The prevalence of ony-
chomycosis in onychodystrophy is likely significantly higher
than the previously reported rate of 50%.3 Studies conducted
on patients who seek medical care for onychodystrophy dem-
onstrated a prevalence between 65% and 95%.6,12-15 Our in-
stitutional data demonstrate an onychomycosis prevalence of
75% based on PAS evaluation of toenail clippings for patients
who received a clinical diagnosis of onychomycosis by a
dermatologist.17 At this higher prevalence range, the incre-
mental benefits of testing rapidly diminish.
These data must be interpreted in the context of the study
design. First, this study includes assumptions about the cost
of treatment and testing from the United States and therefore
may not be generalizable internationally. Another limitation
of this study is the use of testing accuracy data from prior stud-
ies. Determination of accuracy for nail plate testing depends
on the health care professional performing the test as well as
the predefined criterion standard. The statistics applied in our
model are from the study by Weinberg et al,13 in which der-
matologists performed all testing and the predefined crite-
rion standard was the calcofluor white test. In effect, the test
statistics of our model assume that health care professionals
are experienced with performing in-clinic KOH testing from
the nail plate/bed as well as experienced with appropriately
sampling the nail plate for PAS evaluation. However, given the
stability of our recommendations at lower pretest probabili-
ties, these findings likely hold true for primary care physi-
cians and podiatrists as well.
Conclusions
Empirical therapy of clinically diagnosed onychomycosis is
morecost-effectivethanastandardizedtestingregimenforpa-
tients who receive oral terbinafine. Confirmatory testing be-
fore use of efinaconazole, 10%, is associated with substantial
cost savings across a range of disease prevalence.

NOTABLE NOTES
History That Will Make Your Skin Crawl—Insect Use in Dermatology
Anna Augustin, BS
When people think of bugs, it may make their skin “crawl.” It would cer-
tainly be disturbing then, to describe a treatment regimen involving in-
secttherapy.Whilethisseemsstrangeinourmodernworld,insectshave
actually been widely used throughout history to treat certain medical
conditions. It is no surprise that many of these insect therapies do have
clinically beneficial outcomes.
For many years, maggots have been used to enhance wound heal-
ing of necrotic tissue. The larvae of maggots have been shown to eat
necrotic tissue, produce antimicrobial secretions, and destroy any
invading bacteria trying to colonize a healing wound. Typically used in
South America and Asia, these insects are actually commonly used in
remote areas where access to modern pharmaceuticals is limited or
impractical.1

Cantharidin,atoxinthatisfoundonthebodiesofblisterbeetles,iswidely
usedastreatmentagainstwarts.Alternatively,itcanalsobeusedtotreat
molluscum contagiosum and has been investigated as a possible anti-
neoplastic agent.2
While the healing power of cantharidin is isolated from the beetle
torso itself, another insect manually produces 2 compounds that also
have medical implications. The bee, with its production of both honey
and royal jelly, may be one of the most efficient insects involved in
dermatologic healing. Honey mixtures have been shown to improve
healing times in multiple skin conditions, including atopic dermatitis,
dandruff, psoriasis, tinea, pityriasis versicolor, and, in infants, diaper
rash. Honey has also been shown to increase skin wound healing
times and burn healing times in certain studies. In addition to treating
skin disorders, honey has also been shown to improve gastroenteritis
symptoms in toddlers.1 Royal jelly, with its marked ability to promote
collagen synthesis, is used in several skin conditions, namely wound
healing.3
Although using bugs as effective medical treatment may seem
rudimentary or outdated, the obvious benefits of insect therapy
should not be overlooked. More modern methods that rely on
extracts and chemicals produced by the insects, rather than on direct
patient contact with an insect, are being developed. Some of these
substances, such as cantharidin, are already being used in topical der-
matologic agents. Perhaps in the future, removing the “ick” factor of
arthropod treatment will make insect substances more normalized in
the modern medical community.
