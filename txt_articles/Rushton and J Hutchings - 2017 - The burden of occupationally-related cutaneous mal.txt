Background: Increasing evidence highlights the association of occupational exposure and cutaneous malignant melanoma
(CMM). We estimated the burden of CMM and total skin cancer burden in Britain due to occupational solar radiation exposure.
Methods: Attributable fractions (AF) and numbers were estimated for CMM mortality and incidence using risk estimates from the
published literature and national data sources for proportions exposed. We extended existing methods to account for the
exposed population age structure.
Results: The estimated total AF for CMM is 2.0% (95% CI: 1.4–2.7%), giving 48 (95% CI: 33–64) deaths in (2012) and 241 (95% CI:
168–325) registrations (in 2011) attributable to occupational exposure to solar radiation. Higher exposure and larger numbers
exposed led to much higher numbers for men than women. Industries of concern are construction, agriculture, public
administration and defence, and land transport.
Conclusions: These results emphasise the urgent need to develop appropriate strategies to reduce this burden.
Burden of disease estimation is increasingly being used to identify
risk factors contributing to important morbidity burdens and to
help prioritise risk reduction approaches. Previously published
estimates of the burden of occupational cancer for over 20
cancer sites (Rushton et al, 2012) include non-melanoma skin
(NMSC) cancer from occupational exposure to solar radiation
(Young et al, 2012).
Evidence for a causal role of occupational sunlight exposure in
development
of cutaneous
malignant
melanoma
(CMM)
is
equivocal. The meta-analysis by Caini et al (2009) shows that
high naevi counts are associated with CMM on body sites not
usually exposed to sun and that skin/hair colour and sunburns are
highly associated with all types of CMM. Intermittent, relatively
high exposure has been highlighted (Elwood and Jopson, 1997;
Gandini et al, 2005). An increased risk for CMM has been found
for outdoor work or farming in some studies; Odds Ratio (OR) 2.7
(95% CI: 1.2, 5.8; Settimi et al, 1999); OR 1.31 (95% CI: 1.14, 1.52)
(Freedman et al, 1997) but a negative association in others; OR
0.78 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.99; Walter et al, 1999). It has been suggested
that recreational sun exposure increases risk of trunk and limb
CMM, whereas occupational sun exposure tends to increase risk of
head and neck melanoma especially at low latitudes (Whiteman
et al, 2006; Chang et al, 2009). Whiteman et al found raised risk for
head and neck melanoma associated with high occupational sun
exposure (OR: 3.25; 95% CI: 1.3, 8.0) compared with patients with
trunk melanoma and in particular for lentigo maligna melanoma.
However, an Australian study found no increased risk for CMM
and occupational sun exposure (defined as weekday exposure)
overall or at different sites with an inverse association for head and
neck CMM (Vuong et al, 2014).
A large multicentre European study comparing outdoor and
indoor workers found highest risks for outdoor work for basal cell
and squamous cell carcinomas (statistically significantly increased
for farmers/construction workers and for other outdoor work)
but non-significantly raised risks for melanoma (Trakatelli et al,
2016). However, duration of work 45 years gave odds ratios of

 3.02 (95% CI: 1.88–4.86) for melanoma in situ and 1.97 (95% CI:
1.43–2.71) for invasive melanoma.
Although the evidence for CMM is not entirely convincing, it is
suggestive of a potential causal relationship and that a contribution
from occupational exposure is plausible. Hence we estimated the
CMM burden assuming causality and also provide a summary of
the total skin cancer burden in Britain due to occupational solar
radiation exposure.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Burden of cancer was estimated using the attributable fraction (AF)
that is, the proportion of cases that would not have occurred in the
absence of exposure; this was then used to estimate the attributable
numbers (Hutchings and Rushton, 2012). The AF requires an
estimate of the risk of disease, (e.g., a relative risk (RR)), which we
obtained from published literature, and the proportion of the
population exposed (p(E)). To account for cancer latency a Risk
Exposure Period (REP), that is, the exposure period relevant to a
cancer appearing in a specific target year, was defined as 10–50
years for CMM.
The p(E) was derived from the national data sources, accounting
for employment turnover and life expectancy, and adjusted for
employment trends. We here extend our methods to estimate
CMM AF by age group to account for variation in cancer rates by
age, assuming the exposed population and national working
population have the same age structure and that workers enter the
workforce between ages 15–45 and retire at 65.
The CARcinogen EXposure (CAREX) database, which gives
numbers exposed to certain occupational carcinogens in 1991 by
standard industry sector, was used to estimate the numbers
exposed occupationally to solar radiation (Pannett et al, 1998). The
data from CAREX are not differentiated by sex; the 1991 Census
data by industry were used to estimate the relative proportions of
men and women exposed within the CAREX industry sectors.
Industry sectors were allocated as one of (i) farmers (agriculture,
forestry,
hunting,
logging)
(ii)
other
outdoor
workers
(e.g., construction, defence) (iii) mixed indoor and outdoor
exposure (e.g., transport, recreational services) or having low
exposure (e.g., retail, real estate).
Since Britain has relatively low sunlight exposure generally, we
used risk estimates for residential areas of low sunlight, (adjusted
for age, sex, race, socioeconomic status) from a 24 state US
mortality database (Freedman et al, 1997). Sunlight exposure was
assessed by state of residence (low, moderate, high sun exposure)
and usual occupation recorded on the death certificate (classified as
indoor work, combined indoor and outdoor work, outdoor
work
by
non-farmers
and
farming).
The
RRs
were
1.31,
95% CI: 1.14–1.52) for farmers, 1.22, (95% CI: 0.99–1.50) for
outdoor non-farmer occupational exposure, and set to 1 for mixed
indoor and outdoor occupations as the risk estimate was o1;
indoor work (low exposure) was set to 1.
AFs were then estimated separately by age group and applied to
age specific British data available at the time of the study for CMM
deaths (2012) and cancer registrations (2011), and summed to
obtain occupation attributable numbers.
We also estimated disability-adjusted life-years (DALY), the
sum of years of life lost (YLL; estimated from cancer deaths and life
expectancy) and years lived with disability (YLD). Years lived with
disabilities are estimated using cancer numbers, average survival
and an evaluation of health related quality of life using disability
weights developed for the Netherlands (Murray and Lopez, 1996).
RESULTS
The estimated total AF for CMM is 2.0% (95% CI: 1.4–2.7%),
giving 48 (95% CI: 33–64) deaths in (2012) and 241 (95% CI:
168–325) registrations (in 2011) attributable to occupational
exposure to solar radiation (Table 1). Higher results for men
reflect both higher exposure and larger numbers exposed to solar
radiation. Average years of life lost through early death is B17
years, and estimated DALYs due to occupationally related CMM
are 1038 (95% CI: 700–1394) per year.
The main industries of concern are construction (21 deaths, 101
registrations), agriculture (11 deaths, 55 registrations), public
administration and defence (5 deaths, 26 registrations), and land
transport (4 deaths, 21 registrations).
Figure 1 shows the distribution of CMM registrations by age.
Over 50% (128) occur after retirement (65 þ ).
DISCUSSION
Assuming a causal link, we estimate that 2% of all CMM in Britain
can be attributed to occupational exposure to solar radiation,
giving B1 death and 5 new cancers per week. The construction
industry has the largest burden (44% of the deaths and 42% of the
registrations), followed by agriculture, public administration/
defence, and land transport. These results add to the concern
arising from our previous estimate for NMSC of the adverse health
effects of occupational solar radiation (AF ¼ 2.4%, 12 attributable
deaths and 1541 attributable registrations; Young et al, 2012). Our
estimation by age has highlighted the issue of many similar long
latency occupational cancers occurring many years after leaving
work.
Under or over estimation of the burden may have resulted from
methodological
assumptions
and
uncertainties
in
the
data,
including

of

estimates,
inaccurate
estimates
of
proportions exposed and latency.

 Risk estimates for CMM varied between studies. Different study
designs, definitions of personal characteristics and exposure
assessment and inconsistent adjustment for non-occupational
exposure and other risk factors could have contributed to this
(Hutchings and Rushton, 2012). Many were hospital case-control
studies increasing the likelihood of accurate CMM diagnosis but
raising the possibility of selection bias (e.g., Trakatelli et al, 2016).
Recall bias could have occurred in self-reporting of sun exposure,
particularly in more recent studies as awareness of the hazards of
sun exposure became more common. Hospital patient controls
with other dermatological conditions or non-melanoma malig-
nancies in some studies may have been more aware about the
effects of sun exposure; use of case friends, family or neighbours
may give controls with similar occupations and lifestyles (e.g., Vuong
et al, 2014). Adjustment for hair and/or skin colour, ethnicity and
freckling was usual, with some studies also adjusting for tendency to
burn, socio-economic status, sun screen use and recreational sun
exposure.
For CMM, there was no good quality British study of workplace
exposure to solar radiation. The Freedman study chosen may not
have completely reflected exposure experienced in Britain; the use
of death certificate information for residence and occupation might
reflect more recent rather than lifetime exposure.
Industry sectors were allocated as outdoor, mixed indoor/
outdoor and mainly indoor for solar radiation because of the lack
of data on proportions exposed at different levels of exposure.
Implicit assumptions were made regarding the similarity of
durations and intensities of exposure between the population in
the chosen study and British exposed workforce.
SUMMARY
Assuming a causal relationship for all skin cancers and occupa-
tional sun exposure this study quantifies the total burden
specifically for Britain and highlights several industry sectors,
particularly construction. This highlights the need to develop
appropriate strategies to reduce this burden. The Institution of
Occupational Safety and Health (IOSH) have used these results as a
basis for their successful ‘No Time to Lose Campaign’, including
specific factsheets, posters, toolbox talks, films, case studies
targeting occupational solar radiation (IOSH 2016).
