BACKGROUND
High-quality evidence supporting a community-based treatment protocol for chil-
dren with severe acute malnutrition, including routine antibiotic use at admission 
to a nutritional treatment program, remains limited. In view of the costs and 
consequences of emerging resistance associated with routine antibiotic use, more 
evidence is required to support this practice.
METHODS
In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in Niger, we randomly assigned children 
who were 6 to 59 months of age and had uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition 
to receive amoxicillin or placebo for 7 days. The primary outcome was nutritional 
recovery at or before week 8.
RESULTS
A total of 2412 children underwent randomization, and 2399 children were in-
cluded in the analysis. Nutritional recovery occurred in 65.9% of children in the 
amoxicillin group (790 of 1199) and in 62.7% of children in the placebo group 
(752 of 1200). There was no significant difference in the likelihood of nutri-
tional recovery (risk ratio for amoxicillin vs. placebo, 1.05; 95% confidence in-
terval [CI], 0.99 to 1.12; P 
= 
0.10). In secondary analyses, amoxicillin decreased the 
risk of transfer to inpatient care by 14% (26.4% in the amoxicillin group vs. 30.7% 
in the placebo group; risk ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.98; P 
= 
0.02).
CONCLUSIONS
We found no benefit of routine antibiotic use with respect to nutritional recovery 
from uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition in Niger. In regions with adequate 
infrastructure for surveillance and management of complications, health care fa-
cilities could consider eliminating the routine use of antibiotics in protocols for 
the treatment of uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition. (Funded by Médecins

Amoxicillin for Severe Malnutrition in Children
S
evere acute malnutrition affects 
approximately 19 million children under 
5 years of age worldwide and contributes 
substantially to mortality and the disease bur-
den among children.1 To reduce the risk of death 
from severe acute malnutrition, specialized nutri-
tional and medical intervention is required. Bac-
terial infection can complicate advanced cases of 
severe acute malnutrition,2-9 and the risk of noso-
comial infection in inpatient settings can be high. 
Therefore, in 1999, when all children with severe 
acute malnutrition were treated as inpatients, 
the World Health Organization (WHO) recom-
mended routine use of broad-spectrum antibiot-
ics for the management of severe acute malnutri-
tion, irrespective of clinical indications.10
However, more recent developments have 
changed the nutritional and clinical profile of 
children treated for severe acute malnutrition. In 
2006, the development of the WHO Child 
Growth Standards led to a substantial advance 
in the measurement of nutritional status, and 
the number of children classified as having se-
vere acute malnutrition is now 4 to 5 times as 
high as the number before the introduction of 
the standards, depending on the context; since 
implementation of the standards, the weight-for-
height z scores are higher and medical compli-
cations are fewer.11,12 In 2007, the WHO and the 
United Nations endorsed a community-based 
model for the management of malnutrition, in 
which children with uncomplicated severe acute 
malnutrition are treated at home with ready-to-
use therapeutic food (RUTF).13 Community-based 
treatment emphasizes community mobilization 
and the finding of active cases, with the goal of 
reaching greater numbers of malnourished chil-
dren before clinical complications arise.
Although such changes affected the absolute 
number and clinical profile of children with se-
vere acute malnutrition, high-quality evidence to 
support the use of the same medical protocol for 
community-based treatment remains limited.14 
Only one previous randomized trial has exam-
ined the routine use of antibiotics in the com-
munity-based treatment of severe acute malnu-
trition. The findings from that well-conducted 
trial in Malawi, reported in 2013, added impor-
tant evidence to inform international guidance, 
but the high-risk study population, characterized 
by a high burden of kwashiorkor and human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, makes 
it difficult to generalize the findings.15 The pro-
grammatic costs and public health consequences 
of emerging antibiotic resistance associated with 
routine antibiotic use require more evidence to 
support continued practice. We present the results 
of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
trial in Niger that assessed the effect of routine 
amoxicillin use on nutritional recovery in chil-
dren with severe acute malnutrition.
Methods
Study Site and Population
The study was conducted at four health centers 
in the rural health district of Madarounfa, Niger. 
All children presenting to the study centers who 
were candidates for outpatient treatment of se-
vere acute malnutrition were eligible for inclu-
sion if they lived within 15 km of the center, 
were available for the 12-week study period, had 
not been admitted to a nutritional program 
within the previous 3 months or received any 
antibiotic within the previous 7 days, had no 
clinical complications requiring antibiotic treat-
ment, and had no congenital abnormalities. 
Written informed consent was obtained from 
each child’s parent or legal guardian. The crite-
ria for outpatient treatment of severe acute mal-
nutrition were an age between 6 and 59 months; 
a weight-for-height z score of less than −3 ac-
cording to the 2006 WHO Growth Standards, a 
mid-upper-arm circumference of less than 115 
mm, or both; sufficient appetite according to a 
test feeding of RUTF; and an absence of clinical 
complications requiring hospitalization, includ-
ing bipedal edema. Detailed descriptions of the 
study population and methods are provided in 
the Supplementary Appendix and protocol, avail-
able with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.
Study Oversight
The study protocol was approved by the Comité 
Consultatif National d’Éthique, Niger, and Comité 
de Protection des Personnes, Île-de-France XI, 
Paris. An independent data and safety monitor-
ing board reviewed study progress and safety 
events. All authors vouch for the accuracy and 
completeness of the data and analyses reported. 
The first, third, and last authors vouch for the 
fidelity of the study to the protocol.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
examining the effect of routine antibiotic use, as 
compared with placebo, on nutritional recovery 
from uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition. 
Amoxicillin was chosen as the active study 
medication in accordance with current national 
guidelines in Niger.
Children were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio 
and in computer-generated blocks of six, to re-
ceive amoxicillin (80 mg per kilogram of body 
weight per day, divided into two daily doses) or 
placebo for 7 days. The randomization codes 
were created with a computerized random-num-
ber generator according to site; kept inside 
opaque, sealed, consecutively numbered enve-
lopes; and opened by a study physician in nu-
merical order. A study nurse administered the 
first dose of the study medication at the health 
center and instructed the caregiver in adminis-
tration of the remaining doses at home. Adher-
ence was evaluated at the first weekly visit 
through direct questioning of the caregiver and 
review of a pictorial calendar recording home 
administration of the study medication. Amoxi-
cillin and placebo (obtained at cost from the 
Investigational Drug Service, Perelman School of 
Medicine, University of Pennsylvania) were in-
distinguishable in color and packaging. All 
clinical and research staff members were un-
aware of the treatment assignments.
Study Procedures
All children received standard care for outpatient 
treatment of uncomplicated severe acute malnu-
trition, as specified in the guidelines of Médecins 
sans Frontières and the government of Niger. In 
brief, at the time of admission to the nutritional 
program, children received RUTF (170 kcal per 
kilogram per day; Plumpy’Nut, Nutriset) and 
routine medicines. Follow-up in the nutritional 
program was conducted weekly at the health 
center for a minimum of 3 weeks. During these 
visits, a medical history was obtained, and a 
physical examination and anthropometric assess-
ment were performed.16 Children were trans-
ferred to inpatient care if they had any clinical 
complication requiring inpatient management, 
weight loss of more than 5%, or both between 
two consecutive visits or if they had no weight 
gain after 2 weeks. Weekly follow-up data were 
censored at the time of transfer to inpatient care, 
but vital status was assessed 2 weeks and 4 weeks 
after the date of transfer. Children were seen at 
the study health centers at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after 
study enrollment, regardless of their status in the 
nutritional program; physical examination, histo-
ry taking, and anthropometric assessment were 
repeated at these follow-up visits.
Laboratory Testing
We collected stool, urine, and blood samples at 
admission to the nutritional program. In light of 
the low prevalence of bacterial infection and the 
relatively high burden of biologic sampling among 
young children, the data and safety monitoring 
board recommended obtaining samples from a 
subset of 1000 children over a period of 12 
months. Samples were transported to the Epicen-
ter laboratory in Maradi, Niger, and plated on 
culture medium for incubation on the day of col-
lection.17 Pathogenic bacteria were identified with 
the use of standard biochemical techniques, and 
antimicrobial susceptibility was assessed by 
means of disk diffusion.18 Bacteremia and bacte-
riuria were defined as positive blood and urine 
cultures, respectively. Bacterial gastroenteritis 
was defined as a stool culture that was positive 
for a known pathogen and diarrhea. Results of 
confirmed bacteremia or bacteriuria were made 
available to the clinical teams within 1 to 3 days. 
A home visit was made the same day or the next 
day to determine the clinical status of the child, 
and appropriate treatment was provided.
Study Outcomes
The primary outcome was nutritional recovery 
by 8 weeks. Nutritional recovery was document-
ed at or after 3 weeks if a child had a weight-for-
height z score of −2 or higher on two consecu-
tive visits and a mid-upper-arm circumference of 
115 mm or greater; if there was no acute com-
plication or edema for at least 7 days; and if the 
child had completed all antibiotic and antima-
larial treatments at the time of discharge from 
the nutritional program.
Secondary outcomes included nonresponse at 
8 weeks, death from any cause, default (defined 
as three or more consecutive missed weekly vis-
its), and transfer to inpatient care. Nonresponse 
was documented if a child did not meet the cri-
teria for nutritional recovery at 8 weeks.
Statistical Analysis
We calculated that a sample of 1005 children in 
each group would provide the study with 80%

power at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05 to detect 
a between-group difference in nutritional recov-
ery of at least 5%, assuming an 80% likelihood 
of nutritional recovery in the amoxicillin group. 
Allowing for a 20% rate of loss to follow-up, we 
estimated that we would need to include 1206 
children in each group. With an observed likeli-
hood of recovery of 63%, the study had 73% 
power to detect a 5% difference between groups. 
All analyses were based on the intention-to-treat 
principle.
Risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals for 
each secondary outcome were calculated by 
means of unadjusted log-binomial regression.19 
Between-group comparisons of time to recovery, 
transfer to inpatient care, and death among chil-
dren without a response were performed with 
the use of t-tests. We assumed that the pharma-
cologic effect of amoxicillin would be greatest in 
the first 2 weeks after administration and there-
fore calculated the intervention effect on the 
likelihood of nutritional recovery and transfer to 
inpatient care within 2 weeks after admission to 
the nutritional program. We also assumed that 
the pharmacologic effect of amoxicillin would 
be greatest among children with bacterial infec-
tion at admission to the nutritional program; 
therefore, we calculated the intervention effect 
on the likelihood of nutritional recovery and 
transfer to inpatient care among children with 
laboratory-confirmed infection. In additional 
post hoc analyses, we used a likelihood-ratio test 
to determine whether the intervention effect 
varied according to age at baseline (<24 months 
vs. ≥24 months) and sex. Intervention effects on 
additional secondary outcomes, including indi-
vidual signs of infection and gains in weight, 
height, and mid-upper-arm circumference, were 
assessed at weeks 1 and 2. Signs of infection 
included diarrhea (≥3 loose stools in the previ-
ous 24 hours), vomiting, fever (axillary tempera-
ture >38.5°C), cough, tachypnea, and malaria 
with fever. We estimated average differences 
between the groups for gains from baseline (i.e., 
admission to the nutritional program) in weight, 
height, and mid-upper-arm circumference at 
weeks 1, 2, and 4 and at the time of discharge 
from the nutritional program. The intervention 
effect was compared between groups with the 
use of a t-test for weight gain; linear regression, 
adjusted for baseline anthropometric data, for 
gains in height and mid-upper-arm circumfer-
ence; and unadjusted binomial regression for 
signs of infection. Intention-to-treat analyses 
were used; all tests were two-sided, with no ad-
justments for multiple comparisons.
Results
Study Patients
Between October 2012 and November 2013, a to-
tal of 16,421 children presented at the four health 
centers (Fig. 1). A total of 2412 children were 
randomly assigned to a study group, 13 were sub-
sequently excluded for protocol violations, and 
2399 children (1199 in the amoxicillin group and 
1200 in the placebo group) were included in the 
final analysis. Baseline characteristics were simi-
lar in the two groups, with no clinically relevant 
differences (Table 1). All caregivers received volun-
tary HIV counseling and testing; 1 child was 
confirmed to be HIV-positive and was included in 
the study. Program outcome was attributed to all 
children at 8 weeks after admission to the nutri-
tional program. The rate of reported adherence, 
defined as completion of all 7 days of the study 
regimen, was 99% and did not differ significantly 
between the two groups (P>0.05).
Primary Outcome
Overall, 64% of the children enrolled in the study 
(1542 of 2399) recovered from severe acute mal-
nutrition. There was no significant between-
group difference in the likelihood of nutritional 
recovery (risk ratio with amoxicillin vs. placebo, 
1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99 to 1.12) 
(Table 2). Among children who recovered, the 
time to recovery was significantly shorter with 
amoxicillin than with placebo, with a mean 
treatment duration of 28 days versus 30 days 
(P<0.001). Amoxicillin had no significant effect 
among children with a confirmed bacterial in-
fection at admission to the nutritional program 
(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix) and 
the effect did not vary significantly according to 
age or sex (P>0.05 for interaction).
Secondary Outcomes
The risks of nonresponse at 8 weeks, default, and 
death were similar in the two groups (Table 2). 
There was a significant interaction of age in the 
risk of death (P 
= 
0.04 for interaction); amoxicillin 
tended to reduce the risk of death among children 
who were 24 months of age or older (risk ratio,

0.24; 95% CI, 0.03 to 2.12) but not among chil-
dren younger than 24 months of age (risk ratio, 
3.04; 95% CI, 0.61 to 15.01). A total of 13 chil-
dren died during treatment (7 in the amoxicillin 
group and 6 in the placebo group) (Table 2); the 
time to death did not differ significantly be-
tween the groups (29 days in the amoxicillin 
group and 18 days in the placebo group, P 
= 
0.40).
Amoxicillin significantly decreased the over-
all risk of a transfer to inpatient care and the 
risk of a transfer within the first 2 weeks (Ta-
ble 2, and Table S2 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). There was no significant between-
group difference in the mean time to a transfer 
to inpatient care (25 days in the amoxicillin 
group and 24 days in the placebo group, P 
= 
0.62). 
We found no intervention effect among children 
who were transferred to inpatient care for weight 
loss or lack of weight gain, but amoxicillin sig-
nificantly reduced the risk of a transfer for 
clinical complications in general (by 31%) and 
for acute gastroenteritis in particular (by 33%). 
The study intervention had no effect on the risk 
of a transfer to inpatient care among children 
with any bacterial infection, and there was no 
evidence of a heterogeneous effect according to 
age or sex. No cases of severe allergy or anaphy-
laxis were identified. None of the clinical com-
plications or deaths were reported to be related 
to the study drug.
Amoxicillin significantly accelerated early 
gains in weight and mid-upper-arm circumfer-
ence, with no significant effect on height gain 
during treatment (Table 3). The frequency of di-
arrhea was lower in the amoxicillin group than 
in the placebo group at week 1, with no signifi-

cant effect of amoxicillin on the incidence of 
other clinical symptoms. The overall prevalence 
of bacterial infection in blood, urine, and stool 
from children with diarrhea was low (Table 4). 
The likelihood of resistance to amoxicillin was 
35% for enterobacteria isolated from stool in 
children with diarrhea and 66% for enterobacte-
ria isolated from blood.
Discussion
In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-con-
trolled trial, we found that routine provision of 
amoxicillin was not superior to placebo for nu-
tritional recovery in children with uncomplicat-
ed severe acute malnutrition. This finding chal-
lenges the view that routine antibiotic therapy is

always necessary or beneficial. Considering the 
burden of infection and limitations in the local 
capacity for adequate medical follow-up, elimi-
nating routine antibiotic use could represent an 
important simplification of treatment, resulting 
in substantial cost savings with respect to drugs, 
staff, and systems for delivery and encouraging 
expanded service provision and responsible anti-
biotic stewardship. Driven by numerous factors, 
including imprudent antibiotic use, resistance to 
antibiotics can result in infections that are espe-
cially difficult and costly to treat.20,21 Ministry of 
Health data from the Madarounfa Health Dis-
trict suggest that the routine use of antibiotics 
for the treatment of severe acute malnutrition 
accounts for 15% of all antibiotic use among 
children younger than 5 years of age.22
Our study showed that amoxicillin reduced 
the risk of a transfer to inpatient care by 14%, as 
compared with placebo. Further review revealed 
three important insights. First, 53% of children 
transferred to inpatient care according to the 
study protocol (49% in the amoxicillin group 
and 56% in the placebo group) were admitted to 
a hospital (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). Owing to multiple considerations, including 
operational constraints such as limited capacity, 
only 50% of children who were eligible for inpa-
tient care because of weight loss or lack of weight 
gain were admitted. Amoxicillin reduced the risk 
of hospitalization, potentially a more specific and 
generalizable secondary end point than a transfer 
to inpatient care, by 24%, as compared with pla-
cebo (risk ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.92). Sec-
ond, among hospitalized children, there were no 
significant between-group differences in the 
mean length of stay (4.9 days in the amoxicillin 
group and 4.4 days in the placebo group, P 
= 
0.32) 
or the rate of recovery (94% and 96%, respec-
tively). Children in both groups recovered quick-
ly, suggesting that adequate inpatient care may 
mitigate any risk associated with the absence of 
routine antibiotic use. Third, amoxicillin spe-
cifically reduced the risk of transfers to inpatient 
care for clinical complications due to gastroen-
teritis. This was an unexpected finding, since 
the viruses and parasites primarily responsible 
for gastroenteritis in young children are not 
sensitive to amoxicillin.23 A possible explanation 
is that poor mucosal integrity in malnourished 
children allows the translocation of bacteria 
across compromised intestinal surfaces, result-

Plus–minus values are means ±SD. Mean differences and 95% confidence intervals are shown for gains from baseline (i.e., admission to 
the nutritional program) in anthropometric data. Gains were calculated with the use of t-tests (for weight gain) or linear regression adjusted 
for baseline data (for gains in height and mid-upper-arm circumference). Risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals are shown for signs of in-
fection and are based on unadjusted binomial regression.

Tachypnea was measured in children who were 6 to 11 months of age as a respiratory rate of more than 50 breaths per minute and in chil-
dren who were 12 to 59 months of age as a rate of more than 40 breaths per minute. The values shown are the average of the two mea-
sures.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
ing in bacteremia.2,24,25 Alternatively, oral antibi-
otics may reduce excessive proliferation of small-
bowel flora,26 modifying the composition and 
function of the gut microbiome.
One other randomized study, from Malawi, 
evaluated the effect of routine antibiotic thera-
py for uncomplicated severe acute malnutri-
tion.15 In that study, amoxicillin significantly 
reduced the risk of treatment failure (by 24%) 
and death (by 36%), as compared with placebo. 
The authors concluded that antibiotics should 
continue to be used routinely in areas where 
kwashiorkor and HIV infection are prevalent. 
Children with HIV infection, however, were not 
assessed separately, and it was not possible to 
confirm a benefit among children without HIV 
infection. In our study in Niger, malnutrition was 
predominantly due to marasmus, and the preva-
lence of HIV infection was low. Differences in 
study findings may therefore be due to differences 
in study populations, as well as in the level of 
ancillary care and in the frequency of follow-up.
Contrary to previous reports of infection in 
inpatient settings,2-9,27 the prevalence of infection 
among uncomplicated cases in our study was 
low. This new evidence raises fundamental ques-
tions about our understanding of the patho-
physiology of illness in cases of uncomplicated 
severe acute malnutrition. Among children with 
laboratory-confirmed bacterial infection, there 
was no evidence that routine use of amoxicillin, 
as compared with placebo, had a significant ef-
fect on nutritional recovery, although the avail-
able sample size was limited.
We found that routine amoxicillin use pro-
vided some benefit over placebo in terms of 
short-term weight gain. The greater early weight 
gain in the amoxicillin group appeared to con-
tribute to a slightly faster time to recovery (mean, 
2 days). However, without evidence of longer-
term effects on weight or height, the early 
growth-promoting benefits of routine antibiotic 
use may be limited. In Malawi, cefdinir, but not 
amoxicillin, was associated with increased 
weight gain, as compared with placebo.15
Our study has several key limitations. First, 
we assumed a likelihood of nutritional recovery 
of 80%, which was not achieved, and we cannot 
rule out the possibility that amoxicillin had a 
protective effect of 12% or a harmful effect of 
1% on nutritional recovery. Second, although the 
study was not designed to estimate the effect on 
mortality, mortality was lower than expected 
and previously reported. Third, the study was 
limited to one regimen, which was consistent 
with the national protocol. We therefore leave 
unanswered the question of whether alternative 
antibiotic regimens, such as a regimen with a 
dosage that accounts for altered pharmacokinet-
ics in severely malnourished children28,29 or a

Amoxicillin for Severe Malnutrition in Children
regimen that minimizes the emergence of resis-
tant strains, could have maximized recovery. 
Finally, the study interventions were performed 
by well-trained and supervised medical person-
nel and there was close follow-up, features that 
may not be generally representative of standard 
care provided in many nutritional programs. 
Our findings should be confirmed in studies 
designed to reflect real-life contexts.
In conclusion, we found no significant bene-
fit of routine amoxicillin use with respect to 
nutritional recovery among children with un-
complicated severe acute malnutrition in Niger. 
Our findings provide useful information for 
public health authorities and their implementing 
partners regarding the routine use of antibiotics 
in the treatment of uncomplicated severe acute 
malnutrition.
