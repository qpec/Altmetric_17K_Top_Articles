Abstract
Objective
Heroin use in the United States has reached epidemic proportions. The objective of this
paper is to estimate the annual societal cost of heroin use disorder in the United States in
2015 US dollars.
Methods
An analytic model was created that included incarceration and crime; treatment for heroin
use disorder; chronic infectious diseases (HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and Tuberculosis)
and their treatments; treatment of neonatal abstinence syndrome; lost productivity; and
death by heroin overdose.
Results
Using literature-based estimates to populate the model, the cost of heroin use disorder was
estimated to be $51.2 billion in 2015 US dollars ($50,799 per heroin user). One-way sensitiv-
ity analyses showed that overall cost estimates were sensitive to the number of heroin
users, cost of HCV treatment, and cost of incarcerating heroin users.
Conclusion
The annual cost of heroin use disorder to society in the United States emphasizes the need
for sustained investment in healthcare and non-healthcare related strategies that reduce the
likelihood of abuse and provide care and support for users to overcome the disorder.
Introduction
The widespread availability and use of heroin has created a major public health crisis in the
United States. The number of heroin users doubled from 2000 to 2013, rising from 1.0 per
1,000 persons in 2000 to 2.0 per 1,000 persons in 2013; heroin overdose deaths have also more
than tripled since 2002.[1–4] There are tremendous personal and social costs to heroin use

 disorder, and an economic argument can be made for the need to invest in education, preven-
tion and rehabilitation services, as well as legislative reform to address this issue. Heroin users
are less productive than other society members due to premature death; enrollment in drug
treatment centers; and drug-related hospitalizations, absenteeism, and unemployment.[5–7]
High rates of criminal activity and incarceration among heroin users further exacerbate the
societal economic burden due to direct costs (e.g. value of stolen property and cost of incarcer-
ation) as well as productivity loss during incarceration.[8, 9] Additionally, heroin use, specifi-
cally via injection, is associated with several chronic infectious diseases—Hepatitis C (HCV),
Hepatitis B (HBV), HIV-AIDS, and Tuberculosis (TB).[10–12] The treatment costs for these
chronic conditions are substantial; for instance, HIV treatment is estimated to cost more than
$300,000 over a lifetime.[13]
The economic impact of heroin use disorder (the contemporarily accepted term for heroin
addiction) to society in the context of the ongoing heroin epidemic is unclear. Characteriza-
tion of the current economic burden of heroin use disorder is important to understanding the
magnitude of its impact, which can subsequently inform the extent to which resources should
be directed towards mitigating the devastating impact of heroin use disorder. Thus, the aim of
this paper is to estimate the annual societal cost of heroin use disorder in the United States in
2015 US dollars; specifically, we sought to calculate the amount of money society would save if
heroin use disorder was eliminated.
Methods
Model design
An analytic model was designed in TreeAge Pro 2017 (Williamstown, MA) to calculate the
societal cost of prevalent heroin use disorder using the most recently available data (Fig 1).
The model was structured using mutually exclusive ‘health states’ that related to all possible
combinations of the following: incarceration or non-incarceration; chronic infectious diseases
(HIV, HBV, HCV and TB, including no chronic infectious diseases); and health state (heroin
use disorder and infectious diseases) treatment or no treatment. [14–17]
In the model, the overall population with heroin use disorder was stratified into incarcer-
ated population and non-incarcerated populations. Throughout this study, the phrase “heroin
user(s)” refers to users with heroin use disorder as we have operationalized it unless as a cita-
tion to another study, for which we defer to the original researchers’ definitions; the same is
also true with the application of “heroin use” in this study. Subsequently, the model was struc-
turally identical and only differentiated by the prevalence rates of health state occurrence. Each
incarceration group was then stratified by the treatment of heroin use disorder. The infectious
disease branches followed the heroin use disorder treatment branches in a similar arrangement
(Fig 1). Certain other inputs, such as percentage of users treated for a health condition (e.g.
heroin use disorder, chronic infectious diseases, etc.) and associated costs, overdose treatment
and costs, neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) treatment and costs, lost productivity costs,
and cost of heroin to the user, were not explicitly shown as branches, and relevant costs were
instead applied to the model as a weighted average per branch; this process is described in
more detail later in the methods section. The chronic infectious diseases and NAS along with
their treatment costs were chosen for inclusion in the model due to their heightened risk in
heroin users [14, 15], association with each other [16], and/or high cost of treatment.[17]
Mutually exclusive and exhaustive events occurred by literature-identified probabilities at
each branching point shown in Fig 1. The model has been simplified; each symbol represents
an identically structured clone of branches. The ordering of model branches from left to right
was not reflective of the chronological order of events, but instead the conditional prevalence

 rates of combinations of states (e.g. an incarcerated individual having HBV as well if he/she is
HCV-positive) in that pathway. Each pathway represents a mutually exclusive combination of
health and incarceration states included in the model; further assumptions of the model are
provided in S1 List.
Model inputs
Medline, Google Scholar (each with results limited to English), and US governmental agency
websites were searched to identify model inputs. The model inputs included: number of heroin
users in the general and prison populations (used to estimate proportion of incarcerated users);
prevalence rates, treatment costs, and treatment rates for heroin use disorder, infectious dis-
eases, and NAS associated with heroin use; cost of incarceration; productivity loss due to heroin
use or incarceration; crime costs associated with heroin use; cost of heroin to users; mortality
due to heroin overdose; and probability and cost of heroin-related overdose (Table 1).
Costs of treatment for heroin use disorder, overdose, NAS, and infectious diseases were
assumed to be the same amongst the incarcerated and non-incarcerated populations; these
treatment costs were weighted by the rates of treatment for the condition to calculate an
expected treatment cost for patients (not shown in Fig 1). Relevant drug overdose costs were
also applied to each pertinent health state. For example, 33.9% of heroin users were projected
to experience overdose and survive based on contemporary literature estimates.[44, 45] Only
this proportion of living users was assumed to incur overdose treatment costs. A similar pro-
cedure was applied to NAS treatment costs. Patients were assumed to have remained in the
Fig 1. Simplified structure of the cost-analytic model. The cost-analytic model was used to assist in the
calculation of a prevalence based estimate of the annual cost of heroin use disorder in the United States.
Thus, only prevalent cases were included in the model. Not shown in model: Proportion of treatment applied

 same health and/or incarceration state (e.g. incarcerated with HCV) for the entire year. Pro-
ductivity losses were based on the median national wage for 2014 (converted to 2015 dollars)
in the United States[47], which was the last year of data available at the time of this study. In
accordance with a recent US Department of Justice Report, non-incarcerated, living patients
lost 17% of their wages.[21] All costs were converted to 2015 dollars using the Consumer Price

 Index (CPI); full cost updates are shown in S1 Table. Only deaths directly attributed to heroin
overdoses were included as part of the model, i.e. deaths due to infectious diseases were not
included, because the rate of such deaths was substantially lower in comparison to the rate of
overdose deaths; overdose death risks were assumed to be different between those who were
on and off heroin use treatment.[43]
When several data sources were available for a model input, the following criteria were
applied to guide selection for the base case: comparability of study population to US heroin
users, study sample size, strength of study design, duration and recentness of study. When esti-
mates were not available, the model was populated using similar data (S1 List) or inputs were
derived using known information (S1 Calculations).
Sensitivity analyses
One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted for all inputs with multiple values found in litera-
ture by varying the values across ranges found in the literature; one-way sensitivity analyses
were also conducted for specific inputs related to certain assumptions as necessary, even if no
range of inputs was found in the literature. If variation in the model input caused the estimated
cost of heroin use disorder to change by 10% or more, the estimate was considered to be sensi-
tive to the model input. Monte-Carlo simulation was conducted with 100,000 iterations using
all inputs which affected the estimated cost by at least 1% on one-way sensitivity analyses.
Results
Base case results
The estimated total cost of heroin use disorder in the United States was $51.2 billion in 2015
US dollars, with an average of $50,799 per heroin user (Fig 2; S2 Table). Among the overall
population with heroin use disorder, the productivity loss per user ($9,809; 19.3%), HCV treat-
ment ($9,740; 19.2%), crime ($5,447; 10.7%), incarceration ($6,083; 12.0%), and cost of heroin
to the user ($15,234; 30.0%) constituted over 90% of the costs of heroin use disorder. The
mean cost associated with a non-incarcerated heroin user was $44,950; for each non-incarcer-
ated user, productivity losses amounted to $5,087 (11.3%); HCV treatment cost $10,073
(22.4%); crime costs were $5,491 (15.1%); and heroin cost to users were $19,004 (42.3%). Each
incarcerated heroin user cost society $74,428, mostly driven by productivity loss ($28,885;
38.8%), incarceration costs ($30,656; 41.2%), and HCV treatment costs ($8,755; 11.8%).
Sensitivity analyses
In one-way sensitivity analyses, when the number of individuals with heroin use disorder was
varied between 324,000 (people currently using heroin)[18] and 1.5 million (chronic users–
people who used heroin for 4 or more days in the last month)[50] based on possible different
definitions of heroin use disorder, the total cost ranged from $16.5 billion to $76.2 billion,
or 32.1% to 148.8% of base case cost (Table 2 and Fig 3). Using a range of HCV treatment
costs ranging from the past standard of care ($18,977)[51] to the current standard of care for
patients with cirrhosis ($101,380)[32], the overall estimated cost was calculated to be between
$43.6 billion and $53.2 billion (85.2% to 104.7% of base case). The model was sensitive to the
cost of incarceration when it was varied between $15,873 and $65,300[52]—results ranged
from 94.2% to 113.5% of base case value. The estimate was also sensitive to the cost of incarcer-
ation. When the proportion of users in prison was varied between 19.8%[9, 18] and 36%[9]
(base case 19.8%), the overall estimate increased to $56.0 billion (109.4% of base case). Full
one-way sensitivity results are found in S3 Table.

 Using 100,000 samples in a Monte Carlo simulation with the top 9 model inputs that the
model results are most sensitive to in one-way sensitivity analyses, the mean per-user cost
was $57,115.76 with a standard deviation (SD) of $5,619.45 (95% confidence interval [CI]
$47,043.49 to $68,620.78); the cost for the overall population was $52.1 billion (SD $20.1 bil-
lion; 95% CI $19.7 billion to $89.3 billion).

 Discussion
The US societal cost of heroin use disorder was estimated to be $51.2 billion for 1,008,000 her-
oin users (an average of $50,799 per user) in 2015 US dollars. To put the overall annual eco-
nomic in context, we present the annual societal costs of some other chronic illnesses. For
example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was estimated to cost $2,567 per
patient ($38.50 billion in 2015 dollars for 15 million patients), and diabetes was estimated to
cost $11,148 per patient ($248.59 billion in 2015 dollars for 22.3 million patients).[54, 55] Our
study helps to contextualize the cost per individual with heroin use disorder to society, which
is substantially higher than the per-patient cost for conditions such as COPD and diabetes.
A previous study by Mark et al. estimated the societal cost of heroin addiction (the previous
term for heroin use disorder) to be $21.9 billion in 1996 dollars[56] (33.1 billion in 2015 dollars).
The Mark et al. study estimated a per-user cost of $55,167 in 2015 dollars, whereas our contempo-
rary estimate from the current study was $50,799. The substantial difference in total cost of heroin

 addiction/user disorder, 51.2 billion versus 33.1 billion, despite similar per-user cost across stud-
ies, is likely the different population sizes included in each study; 1,008,000 was used as the popu-
lation size in this study as compared to the 600,000 used in the Mark et al. study.[56]
Although both the Mark study and the present study calculated 1-year societal costs of prev-
alent heroin addiction/use disorder, the methods, scope, and population differed between
studies. When a user died, Mark et al. quantified productivity loss for the remainder of the
patient’s working life, defined as the number of years between age at death and average retire-
ment age.[56] This approach is typically only used in incidence-based studies[21] and overesti-
mates the productivity loss contribution to the overall cost in a prevalence cost of illness study.
Thus, the Mark et al. study inappropriately employed both prevalence-based (i.e. annual) and
incidence-based (i.e. lifetime) cost of illness methods. In the present study, only the productiv-
ity loss for 1 year was included in the overall cost calculation following user death or incarcera-
tion to maintain consistency with the typical prevalence cost-of-illness study methods.[57] If
we used comparable methods, our estimates would have been substantially higher. Productiv-
ity loss accounted for 52.6% of the overall costs in the Mark et al. study ($29,018 in 2015 dol-
lars)[56] as compared to the 19.3% of the overall costs in this study ($9,809). Finally, the
demographics of the heroin-using population have changed since the 1990s (with a greater
proportion of women and larger proportion who are White), and model inputs for disease,
crime, and others for cost calculation likely changed as well.[58, 59] Thus, the populations
studied in the Mark study and the present study are not directly comparable.
There are several limitations to estimating the societal cost of heroin use disorder. The
nature of heroin use disorder is complex; nearly all (96%) of heroin users abused at least 1
other substance (prescription opioids, marijuana, alcohol).[2] Additionally, some evidence
suggests that many patients transition from prescription opioids to heroin,[60] while other evi-
dence suggests prescription opioid abuse and heroin use disorder are separate phenomena.
[61] Thus, the degrees of overlap between the abuses of various substances are difficult to
determine without making assumptions that are difficult to verify. We chose to report the data
on heroin use disorder as is as not to introduce additional error by adding more assumptions.
Although the model was developed while considering both available data and clinical
knowledge, some conditional probabilities of disease prevalence were not found in the litera-
ture; in the absence of these figures, certain assumptions were made (S1 List). For example,
HIV was assumed to be the most important risk factor for TB [16], thus the prevalence of
TB in all HIV-positive patient groups was assumed to be the same, regardless of what other
chronic disease(s) were present in the group. Intravenous drug use is a shared risk factor
between all the chronic infectious diseases;[56, 62] thus, due to the interdependent nature of
the diseases, such an assumption of disease prevalence rates undervalues the proportions of
users with co-infection and leads to underestimation of the costs of heroin use disorder. Acute
infections (e.g. pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infections) associated with heroin use were
also not included in this study due to the difficulty of obtaining an accurate cross-section esti-
mate of such illnesses, again underscoring the conservative nature of our estimate.
The downstream externalities of heroin use disorder, treatment of chronic infection(s), and
treatment of heroin use disorder were not captured in this model. Treatment of these patients
for their disease(s) may drastically reduce their chances of transmitting the viruses to others
[63, 64], and treating patients’ heroin use has been shown to decrease rates of new infections.
[65] If IV drug users with heroin use disorder were studied through their entire drug use life-
times with yearly addition of incident users into the model, the effects of such interventions
could be better quantified. Further, public health initiatives such as needle-exchange programs
and their resulting impacts were not included in this analysis. Additional research is needed
on the impact of these externalities and public health programs.

 The generalizability and reliability of estimates for some model inputs were limited, as the
source studies were often conducted in a single location with a small sample size. It is challeng-
ing to conduct studies on drug using populations (e.g. to measure the prevalence of infectious
diseases), particularly imprisoned heroin users.[66, 67] For inputs for which several published
studies exist, prevalence rates often varied widely for both incarcerated and non-incarcerated
populations. To explore the impact of these different estimates on the results, literature-based
input ranges were evaluated across the input spectrum to explore their impact on the results;
the results were robust to most inputs (S3 Table). A major unknown factor was whether incar-
cerated and non-incarcerated patients with heroin use disorder were treated at similar fre-
quencies for health conditions and/or addiction treatment; this uncertainty was evaluated in
one-way sensitivity analysis by varying the ratio of treatment of incarcerated individuals to
non-incarcerated individuals by 25% (0.75 to 1.25). The estimate was found to be robust to
this variation as shown in S3 Table. Overall, the model results were also robust to probabilistic
sensitivity analyses for per-user cost; the Monte Carlo simulation demonstrated a wide range
for the total heroin user disorder cost to society, further emphasizing the uncertainty in the
estimated number of individuals with heroin use disorder in the US.
A major strength of this study was the consistent application of a prevalence-based
approach to estimating cost of illness and careful choice of inputs based on stated criteria for
the population of interest. Additionally, the model-guided calculation of cost of heroin use dis-
order in this study allowed for the detailed determination of productivity loss and treatment
costs by health state. Mark et al. chose to sum relevant costs and applied a different framework
than the approach of this study and could then include a wider scope of costs.[56] Although
the structured model design narrowed the scope of this study (e.g. did not allow for inclusion
of social welfare costs), the model did allow for a more precise estimate by considering infor-
mation specific to each health state, such as the distribution of patients with infectious disease
(s) and the proportion of treated patients.
Sources vary in the prevalence of heroin use disorder, depending on the definition by the
researcher; 200,000 incarcerated heroin users,[9] 324,000 current heroin users (previously
referred to as physically dependent on heroin),[18] 808,000 past-year heroin users (previously
referred to as heroin use disorder)[18], and 1.5 million total users who used heroin at least 4
times in the past month[50] have all been published in the literature. To be clear, in 2015, the
National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) survey, the yearly survey from which we
draw our data, changed its wordings from heroin use disorder to past-year heroin use and
from heroin physical dependence to current use.[68] The figures between years are assumed
to be comparable to their former wording by Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration (SAMHSA), the administrator of the NSDUH; thus, past-year heroin use is
synonymous with heroin use disorder (or addiction, the previously accepted term) and current
heroin use is synonymous with heroin physical dependence. The discrepancy in estimates may
be attributed to the different definitions used by various agencies, e.g. past-year user, use of
heroin for 4 or more days per month, etc., but a precise estimate of heroin use disorder may be
nearly impossible due to issues previously described.[66] Similarly, various studies on disease
prevalence, treatment costs, etc. operationalized heroin addiction/heroin use disorder differ-
ently or did not report the exact definition used; out of necessity, the reported estimates were
used in our study even if the study definition was not identical to that used in our study.
In choosing a base-case value for the number of individuals with heroin use disorder, we
expected past-year users/users with heroin use disorder and current/physically dependent
users to have similar societal costs, and exclusion of users who were not heroin dependent nor
actively currently using heroin from the study would severely underestimate the cost of heroin
use disorder. Additionally, defining chronic heroin use as those who used at least 4 times in

 the past month[66] may be over-estimating the population heavily impacted by heroin use dis-
order. Thus, heroin use disorder was operationalized as heroin use within the last year
(808,000 adult non-incarcerated users [18] in 2015). Minors with a heroin use disorder (21,000
individuals aged 12 to 17)[18] were excluded from the study because their cost to society may
be systematically different from the adult population. The omission of past-year heroin users
less than 18 years of age likely biased the estimate downwards.
The range of 324,000 (people currently using heroin)[18] to 1.5 million (chronic users of
heroin[50]) was tested to evaluate the change in results with varied definitions of heroin use
disorder (Fig 2; S3 Table). In the base case, the non-incarcerated population was assumed to
not overlap with the incarcerated population; by varying both the number of heroin users and
the portion of incarcerated heroin users (19.8% to 36%[9]) individually, the robustness of this
assumption was tested. The estimate was sensitive to the number of users and marginally sensi-
tive to the portion of incarcerated users.
The total cost was also sensitive to the cost of HCV treatment. Because the cost of HCV
treatment has recently increased dramatically due to the introduction of several novel HCV
treatment options,[59] this aspect of model sensitivity is especially relevant. As compared to
the previous standard of care (ribavirin and pegylated interferon), these new options allow the
HCV treatment regimen to be entirely oral, contain a more favorable side effect profile, have
increased cure rates, and require shorter treatment duration.[69] However, these treatments
can range in cost from $83,000 to over $150,000 for a course of therapy. Although the medica-
tions have been shown to be cost-effective, concerns about the affordability may prevent com-
plete adoption of these medications as first-line treatment.[69, 70] As demonstrated in our
sensitivity analysis, if the cost of current HCV treatment remained the same price as that of
pegylated interferon and ribavirin (18,977),[51] the total cost of heroin use disorder would
have decreased 14.8% to $43.6 billion.
Without meaningful public health efforts, the number of heroin users is likely to continue
to grow; the downstream effects of heroin use, such as the spread of infectious diseases[56, 62]
and increased incarceration due to actions associated with heroin use,[56] compounded by
their associated costs would continue to increase the societal burden of heroin use disorder.
The results of the sensitivity analyses suggest that implementation of healthcare policy which
targets reduction in the number of heroin users and decreases in the cost of HCV treatment
may help to mitigate healthcare costs and productivity losses associated with heroin use. The
high cost of incarcerated heroin users compared to non-incarcerated users suggests that crimi-
nal laws aimed to reduce the number or proportion of incarcerated heroin users may help to
control costs. In March 2016, the Obama administration announced plans to focus on treat-
ment of heroin use disorder/addiction rather than incarceration so that former users may
return to full productivity.[71, 72] Increased treatment for heroin use disorder may also reduce
the users’ heroin expenses; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Association
(SAMHSA) implemented new legislation in August 2016 to increase the buprenorphine treat-
ment limit per qualified doctor from 100 patients to 275. This policy may be especially helpful
in rural areas where there is a shortage of buprenorphine prescribers and where many heroin
users reside. Although these policies should be beneficial in reducing both the humanistic and
economic outcomes of heroin use disorder in principle, the effect of these policies on societal
cost of heroin use disorder remains to be seen.
Despite the limitations of this study, many of which are inherent to cost of illness studies,
the study provides important evidence to inform policy on combating the heroin epidemic.
The societal cost of heroin use disorder has not been characterized since 1996, and the results
of this study use the most recently available data and trends to provide a cost estimate of the
burden of heroin use disorder to society in the United States. Even with a comparatively

 narrow perspective, heroin use disorder exacts a tremendous cost to society at $50,799 per
user. Possible targets for reduction of the societal cost of heroin use disorder such as reducing
the overall number of heroin users, reducing the proportion of users who are incarcerated,
and others were also identified. Downstream effects of heroin use such as newly acquired
infections due to needle sharing or high-risk sexual behaviors and the effects of heroin use dis-
order and chronic infectious disease treatments were not captured in this study; additional
research is needed for better characterization of these outcomes.
