Background: A molecular biomarker of physiologic age, as opposed to chronologic
age, is needed in clinical medicine. 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodGsn)
and 8-oxo-7, 8-dihydroguanosine (8-oxoGsn) are two promising aging biomarkers.
Methods:
A total of 1,228 healthy Chinese residents (613 males and 615
females) 2–90 years of age were randomly selected. Spot urine samples were
collected, and the concentrations of 8-oxodGsn and 8-oxoGsn were measured
using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with a triple quadrupole mass
spectrometer (UPLC-MS/MS). Method validation, including accuracy, precision, linearity
and quantification limit, was performed. The relationship between oxidized guanosine
and age/gender was evaluated.
Results: 8-oxodGsn and 8-oxoGsn were eluted at 1.61 and 1.30 min, respectively. The
calibration curve was linear in the range of 0.2–500 ng/ml for both analytes. The lowest
limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 0.2 ng/ml for 8-oxodGsn and 0.1 ng/ml for 8-oxoGsn.
There was an age-dependent increase in the biomarkers from the 21- to 30-year-old
group to the 81- to 90-year-old group in both genders. In the subjects older than 61
years of age, the levels of 8-oxodGsn as well as 8-oxoGsn in urine were much higher in
females than in males. The content of 8-oxoGsn correlated more closely with age and
was higher (approximately 2-fold) than that of 8-oxodGsn for a given individual.
Conclusions: 8-oxodGsn and 8-oxoGsn can be easily measured by UPLC-MS/MS.
Urinary 8-oxoGsn may be a potential biomarker to determine a person’s physiologic age
and identify individuals at high risk of developing age-associated disease.

INTRODUCTION
Aging is a complex process that can be defined as an irreversible decline in the functional
capacity and stress resistance associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality. The rate
of aging differs among individuals due to variations in the genetic and environment background.
Chronological age, which is simply calculated according to birth date, is an imprecise measure of
biological aging. The disconnection between chronological age and lifespan has led to a search for
effective and validated biomarkers of aging.
A good aging biomarker should be based on mechanisms described by major theories of aging,
which mainly include oxidative stress, protein glycation, DNA methylation, inflammation, cellular

senescence and hormonal deregulation (Banerjee et al., 2011;
Horvath, 2013; Catera et al., 2016; Sebastiani et al., 2017). The
current consensus is that aging is driven by the lifelong gradual
accumulation of a broad variety of molecular faults in the
cells and tissues. Nucleic acids, as the basic genetic material,
play a vital role in the protein synthesis. Any error occurring
on a DNA template or in messenger RNA will eventually
lead to the production of abnormal proteins. However, the
exposure of a double-stranded DNA chain or single-stranded
RNA chain to free radicals, including hydroxyl radical (−OH),
superoxide anion (O−
2 ) and nitric oxide (NO−), which are by-
products of normal metabolism, can cause oxidative damage to
biomolecules.
8-Oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanine (8-oxodGsn, also known
as its isomer 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanine, 8-OHdGuo) is by far
the most studied DNA oxidative product because of its C-8
position’s vulnerability to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and its
mutagenic potential (Sekiguchi, 2006). If left unrepaired, this
lesion can result in a G-to-T transversion mutation (Cheng
et al., 1992). Similarly, mismatch of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine
(8-oxoGsn) in RNA to adenine (A) leads to transcriptional errors
and produces abnormal protein (Tanaka et al., 2007; Kamiya
et al., 2009). Oxidized DNA can be repaired by a series of
glycosylases that are specific to particular oxidized bases and
possibly by non-specific excision repair enzymes (David et al.,
2007). These excision products can be transported across the
cell membranes and excreted into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF),
plasma and urine without any further metabolism (Cooke et al.,
2000).
Among the available measurement methods, enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
(ELISA)
has
been
employed
most
extensively to determine the amounts of 8-oxodGsn and 8-
oxoGsn derived from bodily fluids (Garratt et al., 2010). However,
this method overestimates the levels of 8-oxodGsn and 8-
oxoGsn because the antibodies used sometimes exhibit cross-
contamination of 8-oxodGsn and 8-oxoGsn. Chromatographic
methods, including high-performance liquid chromatography-
electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD) (Hofer et al., 2006),
liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-
MS/MS) (Weimann et al., 2002) and gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry (GC-MS) (Ravanat et al., 1999; Lin et al., 2004),
have been developed for obtaining more accurate quantification.
Most notably, LC-MS/MS has distinct advantages over other
methods. Sample impurities can be separated during the HPLC
phase, and all types of guanosines can then be distinguished by
tandem mass spectrometry according to their molecular weights,
which cannot be separated by conventional HPLC.
We previously established an LC–MS/MS-based system
and
determined
the
oxidized
nucleosides
in
senescence-
acceleration-resistant mouse 1 (SAMR1), demonstrating that
the measurement of 8-oxoGsn in urine had potential as a
novel means of evaluating the aging process (Gan et al., 2012).
However, some technical conditions remain to be optimized.
For example, a whole run for a single urine sample lasted
14 min, which is not suitable for large-population investigation.
In addition, the studies were performed using only samples
derived from mice.
In the present study, we applied this procedure to human
urine samples to see if such samples can be used to estimate the
physiologic age.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants and Samples
Participants were recruited from among those undergoing
routine health checkups carried out by their employers in
West China Hospital, Sichuan University from January to April,
2016. Most of them were Sichuanese. Those who met the
following inclusion criteria were recruited in this study: (Catera
et al., 2016) no history of somatic or psychiatric abnormalities
registered in their medical records and (Horvath, 2013) no
history of medication, smoking or alcohol consumption during
the preceding 2 weeks. Some important parameters pertaining
to BMI, blood pressure, blood glucose, lipids, liver function
and kidney function of the participants were summarized in
Supplementary Table 2. Children participants were recruited
from West China kindergarten.
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of
West China Hospital, Sichuan University and the approvement
number is 2014 Clinical Trial (No.14). Adult participants and
parents of the children participants signed an informed consent
form after they were informed about the objective of the study.
Spot urine samples were collected, and concentrations of
8-oxodGsn and 8-oxoGsn were analyzed using ultra-high-
performance liquid chromatography with a triple quadrupole
mass spectrometer (UPLC-MS/MS). Creatinine in urine was
measured using a Cobas P800 system (Roche Diagnostics
GmbH, Germany) in the Department of Laboratory Medicine,
West China Hospital, Sichuan University, which is a College
of American Pathologists (CAP)-accredited laboratory. The
test is called a “compensated” Jaffe assay, in which a fixed
concentration is automatically subtracted from each result to
correct for non-specific reactions caused by serum pseudo-
creatinine chromogens. Urinary 8-oxodGsn and 8-oxoGsn levels
were normalized relative to the amount of creatinine.

8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine as a Biomarker of Aging
The mobile phase contained 0.1% formic acid (A) and 100%
methanol (B), and gradient elution was applied to obtain the
best peak shape (Supplementary Table 1). Electrospray ionization
was performed in the positive ion mode. The multiple reaction
monitoring (MRM) mode was applied during quantification.
The desolvation temperature was set at 500◦C. Capillary and
cone voltages were set at 2.5 KV and 20 V, respectively.
Quantification was based on the signal peak area from transitions
m/z 283.9 →
167.9 (8-oxodGsn) and 299.9 →
167.9 (8-
oxoGsn) related to the peak area of the [15N13
2 C1]8-oxoGsn m/z
302.9 → 170.9.
Urine Sample Preparation
The frozen urine was thawed by incubation at 37◦C for 5 min.
Each sample was separated into two parts. One aliquot was used
for the UPLC-MS/MS analysis to quantify 8-oxodGsn and 8-
oxoGsn. The other aliquot was used to quantify creatinine to
normalize the dilutions of the urine.
For MS/MS measurement, 1 ml of urine was collected, and
a 400 µl-aliquot of the supernatant was mixed with 4 µl of
500 ng/ml [15N13
2 C1]8-oxoGsn internal standard and 4 µl of
formic acid (FA). The mixture was mixed in a vortex mixer and
centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was used
for analyses.
Method Validation
Linearity and Sensitivity Study
Standard solutions of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.39, 0.78, 1.56, 3.125,
6.25, 12.5, 25, and 50 ng/ml of 8-oxodGsn and 8-oxoGsn
were analyzed. The analysis was performed in triplicate. The
quantification limit was defined as a signal-to-noise ratio
of 10:1.
Accuracy Study
Accuracy was determined from the recovery test. A urine sample
with 8-oxodGsn (0.22 ng/ml) and 8-oxoGsn (1.56 ng/ml) was
chosen as the background urine. Ten microliters of 8-oxodGsn
(50 ng/ml) and 8-oxoGsn (100 ng/ml) containing sample were
spiked into 1 ml of urine to obtain low-level urine, 10 µl each
of a mixture of 8-oxodGsn (500 ng/ml) and 8-oxoGsn (1 µg/ml)
were spiked into 1 ml urine to obtain medium-level urine, and 10
µl of 1 µg/ml of 8-oxodGsn and 10 µl of 2 µg/ml of 8-oxoGsn
mixture were spiked into 1 ml of urine to obtain high-level urine.
The concentrations in the spiked urine samples were detected,
and the recovery rates were calculated. The recovery study was
performed in triplicate.
Within-Day and Between-Day Precisions
For within-day precision, urine at 3 levels (low: 0.23 and
1.56 ng/ml, medium: 3.94 and 7.20 ng/ml, high: 12.91 and
26.52 ng/ml for 8-oxodGsn and 8-oxoGsn, respectively) were
analyzed consecutively 20 times in a single day. For between-day
precision, the same urine samples were analyzed consecutively
for 20 days. Precision was expressed as the percentage of the
relative standard deviation (RSD, %). The precision study was
also performed in triplicate.
Statistical Analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS 16.0
software program (SPSS Inc. USA). Urinary 8-oxodGsn and 8-
oxoGsn followed a log-normal distribution, whereas creatinine
was distributed normally. To make the figure look simpler and
clearer, the levels of 8-oxodGsn/crea and 8-oxoGsn/crea were
expressed as the mean±standard deviation. Differences between
gender groups were assessed by Student’s t-test. Analyses of
the relationship between guanine-related compound levels and
age were carried out using linear correlation with Pearson’s
correlation coefficient. All p-values were two-sided, and a p <0.05
was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
UPLC-MS/MS Measurement of 8-oxodGsn
and 8-oxoGsn in Human Urine
A whole run for one sample took 3 min using the present UPLC-
MS/MS method, which was much faster than previously reported
methods (Weimann et al., 2002; Lin et al., 2004) and our previous
method (Gan et al., 2012; Nie et al., 2013). Figure 1 shows
the findings of chromatography for 8-oxodGsn and 8-oxoGsn.
8-oxodGsn and 8-oxoGsn were eluted at 1.61 and 1.30 min,
respectively, without cross-contamination under the optimized
UPLC elution conditions.
The calibration curve was linear in the range of 0.2–500 ng/ml
for both analytes. Even 500 ng/ml of 8-oxoGsn did not overload
the mass detector. The present UPLC-MS/MS method showed
better sensitivity than our previously reported HPLC-MS/MS
method. The detection limit of urinary was as low as 0.2 ng/ml
(S/N = 9.48) for 8-oxodGsn and 0.1 ng/ml (S/N = 11.59) for
8-oxoGsn when 2 µl of urine was injected. These LLOQs were
lower than most of the urinary 8-oxodGsn and 8-oxoGsn levels
reported.
After screening spot urine samples from more than 100
people with different ages and diagnoses, we defined urine with
0.23 ng/ml 8-oxodGsn and 1.56 ng/ml 8-oxoGsn as low level,
3.94 ng/ml 8-oxodGsn and 7.20 ng/ml 8-oxoGsn as medium level
and 12.91 ng/ml 8-oxodGsn and 26.52 ng/ml 8-oxoGsn as high
level. These three levels of urine were used in within-day and
between-day precision assays.
The within-day precision was 2.0, 0.68, and 1.31% for
8-oxoGsn and 10.0, 6.43, and 4.92% for 8-oxodGsn in
low-, medium- and high-level urine samples, respectively. The
between-day precision was 4.96, 2.98, and 2.96% for 8-oxoGsn
and 16.87, 10.88, and 8.90% for 8-oxodGsn in low-, medium- and
high-level urine samples, respectively. The inter-day repeatability
of low-level 8-oxodGsn was not very good (CV = 16.87%)
because the concentration of the chosen sample was lower than
most of the urine sample.
The recovery was consistently good over a wide range of urine
samples (from very dilute to very concentrated). The average
recovery was 102.2% for 8-oxoGsn and 95.9% for 8-oxodGsn.
Blank solvent samples analyzed within the batch verified that
there was no detectable carry-over from urine samples or the
highest standard sample. The oxidative adducts were stable in

human urine for at least 5 days at room temperature, which will
facilitate sample collection from remote, rural areas.
Effects of Gender on the Contents of
Urinary 8-oxodGsn and 8-oxoGsn
In total, 1,228 Chinese residents (613 males and 615 females,
from 2 to 90 years of age) were selected. They were subdivided
into 10-year age classes (e.g., 1–10 years, 11–20 years, etc.). The
distribution of participants among gender and age classes is
shown in Table 1.
We first compared the levels of oxidized guanosine in males
and females after adjusting for age. The data are shown in Table 2
and Figure 2. There were no significant differences in these
values between men and women under 60 years of age. However,
in the subjects ≥61 years of age, the levels of 8-oxodGsn as well as
8-oxoGsn in the urine were much higher in females than in males.
The content of oxidation products in females 51–60 years of age
increased sharply, while the rate of increase in males remained
slow. In males, the levels of 8-oxodGsn/crea in those 51–60 years
of age was 1.2 times the value in those 41–50 years of age (1.53 ±
0.61 vs. 1.23 ± 0.50 µmol/mol), while in females, the ratio was 1.4
(1.88 ± 0.79 vs. 1.33 ± 0.74 µmol/mol). The ratio of 8-oxodGsn,
8-oxoGsn/crea increased 10% between those 41 and 50 years of
age and those 51 and 60 years of age in males (from 1.90 ± 0.54
to 2.10 ± 0.77 µmol/mol), whereas the corresponding value for
females reached as high as 30% (from 1.76 ± 0.67 to 2.30 ± 0.60
µmol/mol). The same tendencies were observed in those older
than 61 years of age, although a small discrepancy was found
in the 8-oxoGsn levels in those 81–90 years of age due to the
small number of samples. The increase in oxidized guanosine and
deoxyguanosine levels in females at later stages of life might be
due to the decreased production of estrogen.

progression of SAMR1 (Gan et al., 2012). In this population-
based study, we found that the changes in two oxidized
guanosine formats against aging were similar to those in SAMR1.
8-oxodGsn/crea started at 1.3 ± 0.49 µmol/mol in the 21-
to 30-year-old group and increased gradually with aging and
reached the maximum value of 2.07 ± 0.69 in the 81- to 90-
year-old group. The same tendency was found in 8-oxoGsn/crea
(µmol/mol): the concentration was 1.62 ± 0.40 µmol/mol in
the 11- to 20-year-old group and sharply increased to 3.12 ±
1.20 µmol/mol in the 81- to 90-year-old group. We compared
8-oxodGsn/crea 8-oxoGsn/crea levels in each age group with
the 11- to 20-year-old group, and also with the gender matched
neighboring younger group. The results were shown in Table 2.
The change in the pattern of oxidized guanosine may reflect
degeneration of the anti-oxidation capacity in the elderly.
We next performed a Pearson correlation analysis to
investigate the relationship between oxidized guanosine content
and age. We set the correlation analysis to begin at 21 years of age
and end at 90 years of age. The results from all 1,126 samples
showed that the content of both 8-oxodGsn and 8-oxoGsn
correlated positively with age (8-oxodGsn, r = 0.337, p < 0.001;
8-oxoGsn, r = 0.580, p < 0.001).

As the denominator, the content of creatinine plays a vital role
in the calculation of the oxidized guanosine-to-creatinine ratio,
any bias in the creatinine level can alter the results. We illustrated
graph (C) over measured creatinine levels at the different ages
in Figure 2. Participants 1–10 years of age exhibited relatively
low levels of creatinine, while those 11–20 years of age exhibited
higher levels. Creatinine correction may therefore not be suitable
in these two groups. To avoid introducing errors, we didn’t
include these two age groups in the data analysis.
Urinary Content of 8-oxodGsn and
8-oxoGsn in Infants and Children
Interestingly, we found that children showed a much higher level
of oxidized nucleic acids than older subjects, so we explored
the oxidation state in babies. We selected 11 seemingly-healthy
babies, 5 aged from 1 to 5 months (average age = 2.6 months)
and 6 aged from 6 to 12 months, and measured the urinary
8-oxoguanosine. The findings for each infant are plotted in
Figure 3. The 8-oxodGsn/crea (µmol/mol) values in the 6-
month-old and 1-year-old babies were as high as 5.91 ± 3.34 and
3.03 ± 1.23 respectively, which are almost 3 and 1.5 times higher
than the values in the participants 1–10 years of age, respectively.
Markedly higher levels of 8-oxoGsn/crea (µmol/mol) were seen
in 2.6-month-old and 1-year-old babies (24.25 ± 13.09 and 8.58
± 2.90), being approximately 5- and 1.6-fold higher than in the
1- to 10-year-old group. There seems to be an imbalance between
oxidation and anti-oxidation states in newborns.
DISCUSSION
Researchers have defined normal aging as a disease, a condition
that can be “manipulated, treated, and delayed” (Nieuwenhuis-
Mark, 2011), therefore, identifying the exact stage of aging
process will be beneficial. A good aging marker should faithfully

(Sprott, 2010), since the aging process itself is a risk factor for
many diseases (Simm and Johnson, 2010).
Under the free radical theory of aging, urinary 8-oxodGsn
and 8-oxoGsn are molecules that may reflect the oxidative
state of the whole body rather than a specific organ, and these
are promising biomarkers of aging. The European Standards
Committee on Urinary (DNA) Lesion Analysis (ESCULA) was
established to resolve the issue of inconsistency among methods.
They concluded that MS- and EC-based assays were more reliable
than ELISAs (Cooke et al., 2008). The first application of oxidized
guanosine measurement based on HPLC-MS/MS was described
by Weimann et al. (2002). Since then, many researchers have
performed studies to improve the performance of the system.
As a result, the UPLC-MS/MS method was established as the
most robust among the previously reported methods in terms
of the detection limit, detection time and accuracy. Our method
is particularly suitable for use in routine measurement for
large-scale epidemiological studies, since large numbers of urine
samples can be analyzed in a reasonable duration (about 20
samples/h, 240 samples/day).
The influence of sex on the contents of urinary oxidized
modified guanosine is controversial. Some studies have obtained
lower values for females than for males (Andreoli et al., 2011),
while others obtained conflicting results. We found that the
excretion of 8-oxoGsn was not significantly different (p >
0.05) between males and premenopausal females; however,
postmenopausal females excreted significantly more 8-oxoGsn
than did males. This is similar to the results of Nakano
et al. (2003), who investigated the 8-oxodGsn (not 8-oxoGsn)
concentrations in 2507 healthy Japanese between 22 and 89
years of age. These results can be explained by the change
in the levels of estrogen and iron. During menopause, a
decrease in the production of estrogen might result in a
reduced capacity for anti-oxidation. Iron is well known to cause
oxidative stress by generating hydroxyl radicals via the Fenton
reaction. Premenopausal females lose iron regularly by monthly
menstruation, which reduces the urinary 8-oxodGsn excretion; as
such, postmenopausal females have higher iron content and are
prone to suffer from oxidative damage (Nakano et al., 2003).
We have taken a keen interest in the relationship between
oxidation markers and age. Most previous studies have reported
a rise in the urinary 8-oxodGsn level with age (Pilger et al.,
2001; Sakano et al., 2009; Kaneko et al., 2012), while a few
found no age-related difference (Nakano et al., 2003). Our
previous study showed an age-dependent increase in the two
biomarkers in mice, rats and monkeys (Gan et al., 2012; Shi
et al., 2012; Nie et al., 2013). In the present study, the same
trend was noted in humans. Interestingly, our result showed
that humans excreted less oxidized guanosine than did animals.
Compared with other studies, the current studies covered larger
range of ages, from neonates to 90-year-olds. It is worthy of
note that infants have extremely high urinary 8-oxodGsn/crea
and 8-oxoGsn/crea levels. This may be because the process of
childbirth is accompanied by an increase in oxidative aggression;
the fetus moves from an intrauterine environment that is hypoxic
to another with greater oxygen content. Alternatively, the
antioxidant system of newborns is weak and may be insufficient
to scavenge the excessive ROS. Along with the increase in age,
the anti-oxidation systems develop quickly and mature. The
lowest 8-oxodGsn and 8-oxoGsn levels appeared in the young
adults (11–30 years of age). As people age, the antioxidant
defense systems degenerate, and the levels of 8-oxodGsn and
8-oxoGsn increase gradually until the end of life. However, of
note: although creatinine excretion is widely used as a method
of normalizing the urinary excretion of analytes, the amount
of creatinine produced each day is related to the muscle mass.
Therefore, using creatinine to adjust the urinary concentration
in those with extremely high (gymnasts) and low (babies)
(Figure 2C) muscle contents will introduce great bias. Since
there is no consistent evidence regarding the reference intervals
of urinary 8-oxodGsn and 8-oxoGsn, it is hard to conclude
whether the high levels of oxidized products in babies are a
reflection of the real physical condition or the result of creatinine
bias.
To date, most studies have dealt with urinary 8-oxodGsn, and
a very limited number of studies have focused on 8-oxoGsn. This
discrepancy in focus may be because 8-oxoGsn is an adduct from
RNA, which does not pass on to the next generation. However,
RNA plays an important role in protein translation, and any
modification of its bases will directly lead to the formation of
abnormal proteins. One important characteristic of aging is the
accumulation of dysfunctional proteins. It is therefore reasonable
to consider that 8-oxoGsn is a biomarker of aging.

8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine as a Biomarker of Aging
Our study demonstrated that 8-oxoGsn is a better aging
marker than 8-oxodGsn in two respects. First, the level of 8-
oxoGsn was higher (approximately 2-fold) than 8-oxodGsn in
age-matched counterparts. Second and more importantly, the
levels of 8-oxoGsn correlated better with the rate of aging
(Table 2 and Figure 1). The 8-oxoGsn content does not always
correlate with chronological aging (Sprott, 2010) but instead
reflects the actual physiological stage of aging.
In
conclusion,
a
simple,
rapid,
sensitive
and
reliable
methodology for the analysis of urinary excretion of 8-oxoGsn
and 8-oxodGsn was developed. Based on this large population
study, we concluded that 8-oxoGsn in urine may be a novel way
to evaluate the aging process in adults.
