BACKGROUND: Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) of the mandible is a late toxicity affecting patients treated with radiotherapy for head and
neck malignancies. To the authors’ knowledge, ORN has no standardized grading system and its reporting is based on retrospective
findings in heterogeneous patient populations. The rate of ORN in the era of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) still is unknown.
METHODS: The authors report the incidence of ORN from prospectively collected data regarding 1196 patients who were diagnosed
with squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and treated with curative-intent IMRT, with or without concomitant systemic treat-
ment, from January 2005 to December 2014. Each case of ORN was graded according to its severity. Clinical and dosimetric compar-
isons were performed between patients with ORN and a matched control cohort of patients without ORN. RESULTS: The actuarial
rate of ORN of the mandible was 3% at 1 year, 5% at 3 years, and 7% at 5 years. On multivariable analysis, smoking (hazard ratio, 1.9;
95% confidence interval, 1.07-3.4 [P 5.03]) and T classification (hazard ratio, 1.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-3.1 [P 5.041]) were
found to be statistically significant risk factors. The presence of cardiovascular comorbidities, use of bisphosphonates, and pre-IMRT
dental extractions were found to be different between the matched cohorts. The mandibular volume receiving 50 grays (Gy) (in cm3)
and the volume receiving 60 Gy (in cm3) were found to be associated with ORN on multivariable analysis in the matched cohort
patients receiving an IMRT regimen of 2 Gy per fraction. CONCLUSIONS: ORN is relatively uncommon among patients with oropha-
ryngeal carcinoma who are treated with IMRT, but continues to occur beyond 5 years after treatment. Modifiable risk factors that are
associated with higher rates of ORN include smoking and the use of bisphosphonates. Minimizing the volumes of the mandible receiv-
ing >50 Gy or > 60 Gy also may have an effect on the ORN rate. Cancer 2017;123:3691-700. V

INTRODUCTION
Oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC) represents the most common head and neck (HN) site of squamous cell malignancy. In
the study institution, intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), specifically with or without systemic therapy, is the stan-
dard treatment of patients with OPC. IMRT improves the avoidance of normal tissues while maintaining target coverage.
The impact of parotid-sparing IMRT on quality of life has been demonstrated by a randomized clinical trial.1 Osteoradio-
necrosis (ORN) of the mandible is a late complication of RT to the HN, characterized by nonhealing mucosal and bone
injury, occurring spontaneously or after trauma, and seriously impacting the quality of life of patients.2 To the best of our
knowledge, there currently is no consensus regarding the most appropriate grading system for ORN. The incidence of
ORN at 5 years has been reported to range between 2% and 40% with 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional conformal radio-
therapy,3-8 and from 0% to 6% with IMRT.9-14 The purpose of the current study was to report the incidence of ORN of
the mandible among patients with OPC treated at the study institution with IMRT, and to characterize factors associated
with this late RT-related toxicity.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS
After approval from the institutional research ethics
board, we conducted a retrospective cohort and nested
case-control study using our prospective, point-of-care
quality assurance system. Patients diagnosed with squa-
mous cell OPC who were treated with curative-intent
IMRT, with or without concomitant systemic treatment,
from January 2005 to December 2014 were included.
Clinical characteristics, treatment modalities, and treat-
ment toxicities were reviewed in our prospectively
recorded
HN
anthology.15
Human
papillomavirus
(HPV) status was assessed by immunohistochemistry
staining for p16.
After treatment, patients were followed up by a radi-
ation oncologist and an ear, nose, and throat surgeon at
Princess Margaret Cancer Centre every 3 months for the
first 2 years, every 4 months for the third year, every 6
months for the fourth year, and annually thereafter.
Follow-up imaging (computed tomography or magnetic
resonance imaging of the HN) was performed routinely at
8 to 12 weeks after RT to assess treatment response. Sur-
gery for the primary tumor site was not part of the treat-
ment strategy in these patients. A neck dissection (ND)
after the completion of RT with or without systemic ther-
apy was performed for residual disease if agreed on by
both the radiation oncologist and surgeon.
Our institutional practice requires a referral to the
Princess Margaret Cancer Centre dental clinic before the
initiation of RT for a comprehensive dental evaluation by
a dental oncologist. Patients were recommended to con-
tinue regular dental and oral hygiene and to regular
follow-up, preferably with our dental clinic or with their
own dentist. Patients routinely were referred back to the
dental clinic at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre when
dental extraction was recommended after RT and at the
first signs of ORN.
For patients with ORN, a matched 2:1 control
group of patients without ORN was constructed using a
combination of variables derived from the initial analysis
and clinical factors suspected a priori or from the litera-
ture to potentially be related to ORN. These factors
included smoking status (former/nonsmoker vs current
smoker), use of systemic treatment (no vs yes), IMRT
fraction size (�2 grays [Gy] vs > 2 Gy), and T classifica-
tion (T1-3 vs T4). In these matched cohorts, we collected
the following mandibular dosimetric parameters: maxi-
mum dose (Dmax), dose to 2% (D2), volume (as a per-
centage and in cm3) receiving 50 Gy (V50), and volume
(as a percentage and in cm3) receiving 60 Gy (V60), as
well as the mean dose (Dmean) to each of the left and right
parotid gland from our treatment planning system (Pin-
nacle; Philips Healthcare, Madison, Wisconsin). For this
same group of patients, we reviewed all dental and medi-
cal records to retrospectively collect information regard-
ing edentulous status, pre-RT dental extractions, dental
extractions after RT, use of bisphosphonates, and cardio-
vascular comorbidities that may be associated with an
increased risk of ORN.10,16
ORN was graded according to the ORN scoring sys-
tem of the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre (see Support-
ing Information Table 1) as follows: grade 1 indicates loss
of mucosa with exposed bone requiring antibiotic treat-
ment or the need for sequestrectomy for a duration of �3
months; grade 2 indicates loss of mucosa with exposed
bone requiring antibiotic treatment or the need for
sequestrectomy for a duration of >3 months and �6
months; grade 3 indicates loss of mucosa with exposed
bone requiring antibiotic treatment or the need for
sequestrectomy for a duration of >6 months, the need for
hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO), or medical manage-
ment with pentoxifylline/vitamin E; grade 4 indicates loss
of mucosa with exposed bone requiring antibiotic treat-
ment or the need for sequestrectomy for a duration of
>12 months, the need for surgery, or pathological bone
fracture; and grade 5 indicates death from ORN.
Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoint of the study was late ORN (any
grade, and grade 1-2 vs grade 3-4) after RT, defined as the
time from the completion of RT to the occurrence of
ORN late toxicity or the last follow-up date. Death with-
out ORN late toxicity was considered as a competing risk
factor. Patients with disease recurrence (local and regional
disease recurrences and distant metastasis) were censored
at the date of disease recurrence. Baseline patient charac-
teristics were compared between the patients with and
those without ORN. Differences between the 2 groups
were examined by the chi-square test and Student t test for
categorical variables and continuous variables, respec-
tively. The cumulative incidence function was plotted to
observe the ORN rate over time. Competing risk regres-
sion models were used for both univariable (UVA) and
multivariable analysis (MVA). MVA was built using the
stepwise model selection algorithm. The selected variables
for the MVA were those demonstrating a trend in UVA
(P < .1). Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence inter-
vals (95% CIs) were reported correspondingly. Two-sided
P values were reported for both descriptive summary and
regression analyses. The Kaplan-Meier method was used
for overall survival analysis. Subgroup analyses were

 conducted among patients with ORN and selected
matched patients without ORN (1:2 match). Patients lost
to follow-up were excluded from analyses (patients who
had < 2 years of follow-up after the completion of RT).
Data analyses were conducted using SAS statistical soft-
ware (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) and R sta-
tistical

software
(R
Foundation
for
Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
RESULTS
A total of 1223 patients with OPC were treated with
IMRT with or without concomitant systemic treatment.
Of these, 27 patients (2.2%) did not have at least 2 years
of follow-up after RT and were excluded from subsequent
analyses. The institutional dose and fractionation sched-
ules for IMRT most frequently prescribed and selected
according to the patient’s performance status and comor-
bidities were 70 Gy in 35 fractions of 2 Gy per fraction
daily 5 days per week (699 patients; 57%); 70 Gy in 35
fractions of 2 Gy per fraction at 6 fractions per week 5
days per week (271 patients; 22%); 60 Gy in 25 fractions
of 2.4 Gy per fraction daily 5 days per week (118 patients;
10%); and 64 Gy in 40 fractions of 1.6 Gy per fraction
twice daily, with an interval of at least 6 hours between
daily fractions 5 days per week (116 patients; 9%). Nine-
teen patients (2%) had a different dose prescription from
the above listed schedules, ranging from 50 to 74 Gy (1.2-
2.6 Gy/fraction) 5 days per week. When concomitant sys-
temic therapy was administered, RT consisted of 70 Gy in
35 fractions of 2 Gy per fraction daily 5 days per week,
with either concurrent intravenous cisplatin or concurrent
intravenous cetuximab. The 3-year and 5-year overall sur-
vival rates for the entire analyzed cohort were 74% and
66%, respectively.
A total of 77 patients were reported to have devel-
oped ORN of the mandible, for a crude overall rate of
6%. Six patients with local and/or regional disease recur-
rence before the ORN event were excluded from time-to-
event analysis because we considered that the salvage treat-
ment modality may have increased the risk of late toxicity.
Characteristics of patients with (71 patients) and without
(1125 patients) ORN are detailed in Table 1. There were
statistically significant differences noted between the 2
groups: a higher mean and median number of smoking
pack-years for patients with ORN (P 5 .0065), more cur-
rent smokers (those patients smoking actively at the time
of diagnosis) in the ORN group (P 5 .048), a higher
number of patients with locally advanced primary tumors
among the ORN group (P 5 .0027), and a higher rate of
NDs performed among patients with ORN (P 5 .031).
ORN of grades 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 was diagnosed in 10
patients, 14 patients, 23 patients, 24 patients, and 0
patients, respectively. ORN management was as follows:
medical management (antibiotics, pentoxifylline, vitamin
E, and topical chlorhexidine) in 10 patients, medical man-
agement and sequestrectomy in 20 patients, HBO in 14
patients, and surgery (mandibulectomy with fibular flap
reconstruction) in 13 patients. Fourteen patients received
no treatment due to patient refusal (2 patients), new meta-
static disease (1 patient), patient being ineligible for HBO
and surgery (1 patient), and no reason reported (10
patients).
The median follow-up was 5.1 years. The median
time to the development of ORN from the end of RT was
0.9 years (range, 0.2-8.2 years). The actuarial rate of
ORN of the mandible was 3% at 1 year, 5% at 3 years,
and 7% at 5 years (Fig. 1). There was no statistically sig-
nificant difference with regard to the incidence of ORN
noted between HPV-positive and HPV-negative patients
(P 5 .117).
On UVA, smoking habits (current vs nonsmoker/
former
smoker)
(HR,
1.83;
95%
CI,
1.14-2.91
[P 5 .011]), smoking pack-years (<20 pack-years vs � 20

and T classification (T1-T3 vs T4) (HR, 2.09; 95% CI,
1.27-3.45 [P 5 .0037]) were found to be statistically sig-
nificant risk factors for developing ORN of the mandible.
On MVA, only smoking habits (HR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.07-
3.4 [P 5 .03]) and T classification (HR, 1.78; 95% CI,
1.02-3.1 [P 5 .041]) remained statistically significant. It

 is interesting to note that the tumor subsite appeared to
have no impact on the likelihood of developing ORN in
the cohort of patients in the current study (Table 2).
We performed subgroup analysis on cohorts of
HPV-positive and HPV-negative patients. Smoking his-
tory, smoking pack-years, and T classification remained
statistically significant on UVA for the HPV-positive
cohort, whereas no variable was found to be statistically
significant in the HPV-negative population. For the
patients who were HPV positive, only smoking history
maintained statistical significance on MVA.
To investigate additional variables that may contrib-
ute to the development of ORN, we next performed a
detailed analysis of matched cohorts of patients with
ORN (71 patients) versus controls without ORN (142
patients). Specifically, we analyzed the presence of cardio-
vascular comorbidities, the use of bisphosphonates, pre-
RT and post-RT dental extractions, edentulous status,
patient compliance with dental follow-up, and RT
regimen. Of these, the presence of cardiovascular comor-
bidities, the use of bisphosphonates, and pre-RT dental
extractions each were found to have statistically significant
associations with ORN (see Supporting Information
Table 2).
Finally, a dose/volume analysis was performed for
patients in the matched cohort who received an IMRT regi-
men of 2 Gy per fraction (56 of 71 patients with ORN and
105 of 142 patients without ORN), and found that there
was a statistically significant difference in mandibular V50
(in cm3) and V60 (in cm3) (see Supporting Information
Table 3); both UVA and MVA confirmed these 2 variables
to be predicative of ORN (Table 3). For both the case and
control groups, the mandibular dose/volume parameters
were significantly worse for patients classified with T4 dis-
ease (see Supporting Information Table 4).
DISCUSSION
In the current study, we reviewed the incidence of ORN
of the mandible in patients treated with IMRT for
OPC. This population is anticipated to have high rates
of cure, especially in patients with HPV-positive dis-
ease, and long-term survivors will be at risk of late toxic-
ities such as ORN. After a median follow-up of 5.1
years, the crude rate of ORN of the mandible in the cur-
rent study was 6%. Our actuarial rates for all grades
were 3% at 1 year, 5% at 3 years, and 8% at 5 years.
This is consistent with Tsai et al, who found an inci-
dence of 6% for patients with OPC who are treated with
IMRT, although their follow-up was shorter and they
restricted their patient selection to patients with T1 to
T2 disease.14 Mendenhall et al reported an ORN rate of
3% requiring surgery in their cohort of patients with
OPC who were treated with IMRT,17 similar to our
observed rate of grade 4 ORN (24 patients; 2%).
Because our estimates of ORN rates were based on
observed events and patients with insufficient follow-up
were excluded, these estimates are the minimum
expected rates because with additional follow-up, more
ORN cases may develop.
We used the study institution’s long-standing grad-
ing system (Table 1) to grade the severity of ORN. It is
important to note that our grading system has been con-
sistently applied over the study period in conjunction
with our dental team. Because interventions (including
sequestration, medical interventions, HBO, and surgery)
were applied based on the duration and extent of ORN,
these interventions in combination with clinical and
radiographic information provide a consistent estimate of
severity, which is the purpose of a grading schema. In

have been used, including the Radiation Therapy Oncol-

(LENT/SOMA) scale.16 However, in some publications,
the grading system is not mentioned.4,5,17,21 In the future,
consensus guidelines for grading and reporting ORN may
increase the consistency in literature and prospective
trials.22
When comparisons between different series are
made, discrepancies that exist in the above mentioned
grading systems must be taken into account. Our grading
system for ORN is based on the duration of bone expo-
sure and the management required, similar to the grading
definitions of Glanzmann and Gratz3 or Tsai et al.14
However, the decision and timing of ORN-related inter-
ventions or treatments were based solely on our institu-
tional experience and expertise. In the current study, we
examined patients with OPC, a group who are routinely
treated with definitive RT with or without systemic ther-
apy at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre. We excluded
those individuals with carcinomas of the oral cavity, lar-
ynx, and hypopharynx to minimize confounding variables

 introduced by surgical cancer management. Patients
requiring mandibulotomies or mandibulectomies have
been reported to have a higher risk of bone necrosis after
RT.10 However, we still observed that patients who had
undergone ND had higher rates of ORN. Because ND
would be performed only in those patients with residual/
recurrent neck disease, this may be related to the addi-
tional mandibular dose delivered due to treatment of mac-
roscopic lymph nodes using a high RT dose. In patients
with carcinomas of the larynx and hypopharynx, the dose
delivered to the mandible usually is low due to increased
tumor distance to this organ. Many prior publications
have included all HN sites, which may result in a more
heterogeneous population.9-13
In the current series, the median time to the develop-
ment of ORN of the mandible was 9 months (range, 2-98
months). The highest incidence of ORN is reported to
occur between 6 months to 2 years after RT, although
cases have been reported >10 to 15 years after receipt of
RT.3,16,19,23 It is important to point out that there may be
multiple types of toxicities described as ORN, which have
been included in the current analysis. We did not have
sufficient events to perform separate analyses on those
patients who developed ORN rapidly (within 6 months
to 24 months after treatment) compared with those who
developed ORN much later (>5 years after treatment). In
both our MVAs, current smoking status at the time of
diagnosis was found to be significantly associated with
ORN of the mandible, similar to other published
series.14,20 Smoking is associated with poor oral hygiene,
but may decrease oxygenation of tissues and affect the
healing process of the acute damage and vascular disorders
occurring throughout RT. The generation of acute muco-
sal wounds also can be increased by concomitant chemo-
therapy and altered fractionation,24 although these
variables were not found to significantly contribute to the
incidence of ORN in the population in the current study.
Patients with a locally advanced primary tumor
(classified as T4a and T4b) were found to have a higher
risk of developing ORN. Two patients with T4 disease in
the ORN cohort had preexisting bone invasion compared
with none in the matched cohort without ORN. How-
ever, we found that for all patients (those with and with-
out ORN), the mandibular dose/volume parameters were
higher for patients with T4 disease. This finding is vali-
dated by recent dosimetric studies regarding the dose

 distribution with IMRT to the teeth-bearing regions. One
study that included all patients with HN cancers found
that the mandibular molar region received the highest
doses among patients with tumors of the base of the
tongue and tonsil; those with smaller tumors (classified as
T1-T2) received lower doses to the anterior versus the
posterior mandible, whereas the entire mandible was at
risk of receiving higher doses in individuals with larger
tumors (classified as T3-T4), with a threshold of 55 Gy
for the development of ORN.25 Another study that
included only patients with tumors of the base of the
tongue observed lower doses in the anterior mandible
among those with smaller tumors, whereas patients with
large tumors received high doses in the entire mandible,
with the anterior bone receiving >60 Gy.26
The comparison of clinical factors in our case-
control analysis demonstrated differences in the use of
bisphosphates and pre-RT dental extractions, and the
presence of cardiovascular comorbidities. Post-RT dental
extraction is a well-described trauma initiating ORN,27
but at our institution post-RT dental extraction was an
uncommon event. This could be explained by the careful
pretreatment dental assessment that was performed,
resulting in the extraction of decayed teeth before RT was
administered; continued attention to oral hygiene after
RT; the use of fluoride trays; and conservative dental
treatment. However, patients with ORN were found to
have a higher rate of pre-RT dental extraction compared
with the cohort without ORN. Dental extraction before
RT also can be viewed as a surrogate for worse dental
hygiene, smoking, and comorbidities, which may predis-
pose these patients toward a higher risk of ORN from
inadequate healing.7 Finally, we found that there were
more patients with ORN who were receiving treatment
with bisphosphonates, a medication that previously has
been shown to increase the risk of mandibular necrosis.28
RT and the above clinical and dental factors are recog-
nized factors in impaired wound healing, which may be
an additional contributing factor in the pathophysiology
of ORN (hypovascularity-hypoxia).29
With regard to RT dose, the volume of the mandible
receiving >50 Gy or > 60 Gy was highly correlated with
ORN. V50 and V60 previously have been described as
being associated with the risk of ORN, and therefore it
has been suggested to minimize the percentage of mandib-
ular volume exposed to 50 Gy.14 Several studies observed
an increased risk of ORN in patients receiving >65 Gy to
the mandible.3,4,8,11 Among those patients receiving the
RT regimen of 2 Gy per fraction, only 3 of 56 patients
with ORN and 7 of 105 patients without ORN received
<70 Gy to the mandible. In the study institution, the
planning goal for mandibular Dmax (0.1 cm3) when a part
of the mandible is included in the planning target volume
receiving 70 Gy is � 73.5 Gy; when there is no overlap of
the planning target volume of 70 Gy and the mandible,
the planning goal Dmax is � 70 Gy. The target dose for
the parotid glands is Dmean < 26 Gy. This constraint was
achieved in only 18% and 15% of the patients, respec-
tively, among those patients with and without ORN.
Xerostomia and its impact on dental decay and post-RT
dental extraction can be reduced and prevented by
parotid-sparing IMRT.30,31 The presence of patients
treated with bisphosphonates complicates this dosimetric
analysis because there may be an overlap between
bisphosphonate-induced mandibular necrosis and ORN.
We opted to include patients treated with bisphospho-
nates because some patients with OPC will receive treat-
ment with bisphosphonates during clinical practice.
Although the current study is retrospective in nature,
its data are derived from a very robust prospective data-
base. In addition, the patients in the current study were
treated under a universal health care system that helps to
ensure that patients have consistent long-term follow-up
to monitor for late toxicities such as ORN. We believe the
data from the current study add to the modest quantity
and quality of data concerning ORN in the IMRT era,
particularly for patients with OPC. With the increasing
incidence of HPV-positive OPC, and its excellent prog-
nosis, the focus of future research should be on reducing
the late treatment-related toxicity burden on long-term
survivors. With the ongoing deintensification trials for
HPV-positive patients with OPC, the de-escalation of the
RT dose hopefully will reduce the rate of bone damage.
Conclusions
Smokers, patients with large tumors, and patients under-
going pre-RT dental extractions represent the OPC popu-
lation that is most at risk of developing ORN of the
mandible after undergoing curative IMRT with or with-
out systemic treatment. IMRT optimization minimizing
V50 (in cm3) and V60 (in cm3) should be considered in
the planning process. Smoking cessation interventions
need to be integrated in oncological patient care.
