BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium is a common pre-
ventable complication experienced by older adults under-
going elective surgery. In this systematic review and meta-
analysis, we identified prognostic factors associated with
the risk of postoperative delirium among older adults un-
dergoing elective surgery.
METHODS: Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Cen-
tral Register of Controlled Trials, and AgeLine were
searched for articles published between inception and
April 21, 2016. A total of 5692 titles and abstracts were
screened in duplicate for possible inclusion. Studies using
any method for diagnosing delirium were eligible. Two
reviewers independently completed all data extraction
and quality assessments using the Cochrane Risk-of-
Bias Tool for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and the
Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cohort studies. Ran-
dom effects meta-analysis models were used to derive
pooled effect estimates.
RESULTS: Forty-one studies (9384 patients) reported
delirium-related prognostic factors. Among our included
studies, the pooled incidence of postoperative delirium
was 18.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 14.3–23.3%,
number needed to follow [NNF] = 6). Geriatric syndromes
were important predictors of delirium, namely history of
delirium (odds ratio [OR] 6.4, 95% CI 2.2–17.9), frailty (OR
4.1, 95% CI 1.4–11.7), cognitive impairment (OR 2.7, 95%
CI 1.9–3.8), impairment in activities of daily living (ADLs;
OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.6–2.6), and impairment in instrumental
activities of daily living (IADLs; OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.3–2.8).
Potentially modifiable prognostic factors such as psycho-
tropic medication use (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.4–3.6) and smok-
ing status (OR 1.8 95% CI 1.3–2.4) were also identified.
Caregiver support was associated with lower odds of post-
operative delirium (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52–0.91).
DISCUSSION: Though caution must be used in interpret-
ing meta-analyses of non-randomized studies due to the
potential influence of unmeasured confounding, we iden-
tified potentially modifiable prognostic factors including
frailty and psychotropic medication use that should be
targeted to optimize care.

INTRODUCTION
As our population ages, there will be a greater need for elective
surgeries among older adults; however, elective surgeries can
be associated with significant harm.1, 2 Delirium is one of the
most common complications of surgery among older adults,
and has been associated with prolonged hospitalization, death,
and admission to long-term care.2–4 Multifactorial interven-
tions with a focus on optimizing mobility, vision, hearing,
hydration, cognition, and sleep have proven to be effective
delirium prevention strategies in medical and surgical set-
tings.5–7 Therefore, identifying patients at risk of delirium is
important because clinicians can develop plans to mitigate this
risk. Although older adults are seen in the preoperative med-
icine clinic for cardiovascular and respiratory risk optimization
before an elective surgery, often not enough consideration is
given to risk stratification for adverse outcomes that are more
common in older adults, such as delirium—despite evidence
to aid in its assessment and of effective interventions for its
prevention.6, 8
Understanding delirium risk factors may help clinicians,
patients, and caregivers in targeting non-pharmacological
and pharmacological interventions aimed at lessening its bur-
den. The purpose of our systematic review is to identify
preoperative patient characteristics of older adults undergoing
elective surgery that either predispose them to or protect them
from developing postoperative delirium. We also present the
pooled prevalence of postoperative delirium and the risk of

 delirium-related adverse outcomes from these studies. This
information can be used by clinicians and patients to enhance
medical decision-making and by researchers to study possible
interventions aimed at lowering the incidence of postoperative
delirium among older adults undergoing elective surgery.
METHODS
This study was reported in accordance with both the PRISMA
statement for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses
and the MOOSE statement for reporting meta-analysis of
observational studies in epidemiology.9, 10 This systematic
review and meta-analysis has a companion report under re-
view at the time of publication that focuses on complications
of elective surgery among older adults, excluding delirium.
Eligibility Criteria
Prospective studies (e.g., RCTs, non-randomized controlled
trials, prospective cohort studies) were eligible if they included
older adults undergoing elective surgery (all patients ≥60 years
old and mean patient age ≥65 years) and reported prognostic
factors associated with postoperative delirium or delirium-
related adverse outcomes. We limited our search to prospec-
tive studies because delirium is not well-captured in patient
charts or electronic databases.11 Studies using any method for
diagnosing postoperative delirium were eligible, and all defi-
nitions of each prognostic factor were included. Studies that
included patients ≥60 years old were selected to align with
definitions from the United Nations and the World Health
Organization.12, 13 Studies reporting only clinical, laboratory,
or imaging investigations that are not conducted as part of
routine clinical practice (i.e., measuring serum interleukin
levels) were excluded, as were studies disseminated in lan-
guages other than English.
Information Sources and Search Strategy
An experienced librarian searched MEDLINE (OVID inter-
face, 1948 to April week 3, 2016), EMBASE (OVID interface,
1980 to April week 3, 2016), CINAHL (EBSCO interface,
1994 to April 21, 2016), Cochrane Central Register of Con-
trolled Trials (issue 4, April 2016), and AgeLine (EBSCO
interface, 1968 to April 21, 2016) for potentially relevant
studies. The full search strategy for MEDLINE (eSearch 1 in
Supplement 1) was modified as necessary for the other data-
bases (full searches available upon request). The electronic
search was supplemented by scanning the reference lists of
included studies, searching the authors’ personal files, and
contacting authors of conference proceedings.
Study Selection
Two levels of screening were completed independently by two
reviewers using Synthesi.SR (proprietary online software de-
veloped by the Knowledge Translation Program, Toronto,
Canada): (1) screening of titles and abstracts and (2) full-text
screening of articles. Initially, each reviewer independently
screened 10% of a random sample of citations to ensure
adequate inter-rater agreement. Study authors were contacted
for further information if it was unclear whether the study met
inclusion criteria. Disagreements concerning article inclusion
were resolved through discussion; otherwise, a third reviewer
was available to make a final decision.
Data Abstraction
Two reviewers abstracted data independently from studies
retained from level 2 screening. Study characteristics (e.g.,
study design) and prognostic factors associated with postop-
erative delirium were abstracted from included studies. Defi-
nitions operationalized by study authors for individual prog-
nostic factors were also abstracted, where appropriate
(eTable 1 in Supplement 1). Conflicts regarding the abstracted
data were resolved through discussion. Authors were con-
tacted for further information when the data were not clearly
reported. When multiple studies reported data from the same
source, the publication with the longest duration of follow-up
was considered the major publication. If the duration of
follow-up was the same for two or more publications, the
study published first was considered the major publication.
Methodological Quality Assessment
Two reviewers independently completed the quality assessment
for each study using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias Tool for RCTs or
the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cohort studies.14, 15 We
plannedtoassessotherstudydesignswiththeCochraneEffective
Practice and Organization Care (EPOC) Risk-of-Bias Tool.16
Statistical Methods
We calculated odds ratios (ORs), mean differences (MDs), or
standardized mean differences (SMDs) to quantify the relative
risk of prognostic factors associated with postoperative delir-
ium and delirium-related complications. Whenever only con-
tinuous effect measures, such as MDs (e.g., age, body mass
index) were reported by study authors, these effect measures
were transformed to OR estimates, if needed, to derive an
overall effect estimate that combined both dichotomous and
continuous study-level effect estimates.17 For studies that
reported multiple options with which to derive the effect
estimate (e.g., 2 × 2 tables, adjusted and unadjusted ORs,
MDs), the order of preference for selecting the source data is
described in eTable 2 in Supplement 1.
Random effects models were used to pool incidences of
delirium and derive overall effect estimates with 95% CIs
when two or more studies reported extractable effect estimates.
The NNF was calculated as 1/pooled incidence of delirium.
Information regarding data imputation methods to approxi-
mate mean and standard deviation values is found in eMethods
1 in Supplement 1. Between-study statistical heterogeneity

 was quantitatively assessed with the I2 statistic and thresholds
for its interpretation were consistent with those reported in the
Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interven-
tions.18 Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore sources
of substantial between-study heterogeneity based on patient
age and the type of elective surgery. A prognostic factor was
considered significantly associated with postoperative deliri-
um at a two-tailed p-value <0.05.
Prognostic factors that were reported in at least 10 studies
were assessed for publication bias by visual inspection of
funnel plots for asymmetry and with the Egger’s test.18, 19
Where there was evidence of significant publication bias
(p < 0.05), the trim-and-fill method was used to estimate the
number of missing studies and to derive the combined effect
estimates, adjusting for publication bias.20 All statistical anal-
yses were conducted in R, version 3.2.4, using the metafor and
meta packages.21, 22
RESULTS
Of the 5692 titles and abstracts that were screened for inclu-
sion, we identified 41 studies (9384 patients) that reported
prognostic factors associated with the risk of developing post-
operative delirium and its consequences (Fig. 1 and Table 1).
Of these, 37 studies (8557 patients) were included in meta-
analyses.1–3, 23–47, 49–52, 56–60 In the four studies not included
in our meta-analyses, data relating to prognostic factors were
either not reported in an abstractable format or were reported
in only one study.61–64 One additional study was excluded
from analysis as there were data inconsistencies that precluded
calculation of effect measures and we were not able to obtain
further information from the study authors (see eMethods 2 in
Supplement 1). One RCT was included, which was at moder-
ate to high risk of bias (eTable 3 in Supplement 1). Overall, the
included cohort studies were of moderate to high methodo-
logical quality (eTable 4 in Supplement 1). The most common
biases were the adequacy of follow-up of cohorts and the
failure to demonstrate that delirium was not present prior to
surgery. Delirium was diagnosed by the Diagnostic and Sta-
tistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria (48.8%),
the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) (24.4%), both the
DSM and CAM criteria (4.9%), and other methods. The
method of diagnosis was not stated in 4 studies (Table 1).65, 66
Incidence of Postoperative Delirium
The pooled incidence of postoperative delirium among includ-
ed studies was 18.7% (95% CI 14.6–23.5%, 40 studies, 9305
patients, I2 = 95.6%, NNF = 6). The pooled incidence of
delirium varied by surgical type: cardiac (23.6%, 95% CI

NNF = 4), vascular (15.8%, 95% CI 7.7–29.5%, 4 studies,
I2 = 94.2%, NNF = 7), and urological surgery (12.7%, 95% CI
1.8–53.8%, 2 studies, I2 = 98.6%, NNF = 8).
Prognostic Factors
A history of delirium, frailty, and cognitive impairment were
most strongly associated with developing postoperative delir-
ium (Table 2 and eFigure 1 in Supplement 1). Other factors
associated with developing postoperative delirium included
psychotropic medication use, smoking status, older age,
ASA status, and impairment in ADLs and IADLs. The avail-
ability of caregiver support was associated with a lower odds
of postoperative delirium.
Subgroup Analyses of Prognostic Factors
The odds of developing postoperative delirium among patients
aged ≥80 years were significantly increased (Table 3).25, 32, 36,
43–45, 49, 58 Age was a significant prognostic factor among
patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery3, 24–29, 37, 38, 41–45, 49–
51, 56, 58, 59; however, it was not a significant prognostic factor
among patients undergoing cardiac surgery.1, 2, 31, 33, 34, 36
Because of the substantial heterogeneity among the studies
conducted in the non-cardiac surgery population, subgroup
analyses were conducted based on the type of surgery. A
statistically significant association between age and the odds
of developing postoperative delirium remained for each of the
following surgical populations: orthopedic surgery, vascular
surgery, urological surgery, and general surgery.
Cognitive impairment was a significant risk factor for post-
operative delirium in patients undergoing cardiac or non-
cardiac surgery.24–27, 29, 32, 37, 38, 41–44, 50–52, 56, 59 Cognitive
impairment was also a risk factor for delirium in patients
undergoing orthopedic surgery, vascular surgery, and urolog-
ical surgery; however, cognitive impairment among patients
undergoing general surgery was not associated with develop-
ment of postoperative delirium.
In a subgroup analysis of patients who reported a history of
alcoholabuse,therewasnosignificanteffectonthedevelopment
of postoperative delirium (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.56–1.8, 4 studies,
I2 = 0%); however, among a subgroup of current smokers, there
was an association between smoking and postoperative delirium
(OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.5–5.3, 3 studies, I2 = 0%).
Sensitivity Analyses
Sensitivity analyses were conducted that included studies
reporting ORs adjusted for potentially important confound-
ers. Among studies reporting a significant association in the
original meta-analyses, only renal insufficiency was no lon-
ger associated with increased odds of postoperative delirium
(OR 2.0, 95% CI 0.44–9.6, 2 studies, I2 = 87.3%); however,
the two studies included in this summary effect measure
were clinically heterogeneous. The study by Bakker et al.
reported renal insufficiency as a measure of serum creati-
nine level and found no significant association between
renal insufficiency and postoperative delirium, whereas the
study by Sasajima et al., reported the number of patients
with end-stage renal disease, which was significantly asso-
ciated with postoperative delirium.1, 59 Following sensitiv-
ity analysis, a significant association remained for both age
(OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.3–3.3, 9 studies, I2 = 96.1%) and cogni-
tive impairment (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.6–5.3, 10 studies,
I2 = 78.9%). Additionally, when only those studies reporting
the age-adjusted odds of postoperative delirium among
older adults with cognitive impairment were included in
the sensitivity analysis, there was still a significant associa-
tion (OR 3.5,95% CI 1.5–7.9, 8 studies, I2 = 86.5%). Among
the prognostic factors that were not significantly associated

 with postoperative delirium in the original meta-analyses,
only the association between hypertension and postopera-
tive delirium was statistically significant (OR 3.1, 95% CI
1.4–7.0, 2 studies, I2 = 6.1%). There were a number of
studies that reported only unadjusted ORs, which precluded
sensitivity analysis (eTable 5 in Supplement 1).
Assessment for Publication Bias
There was evidence suggesting small study bias among those
studies reporting cognitive impairment (p = 0.02). It was
estimated that five studies with non-significant results may
have been suppressed, although even after adjusting for these
potentially missing studies, cognitive impairment remained a
significant risk factor (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.5–3.2, I2 = 76.3%,
p < 0.001; eFigure 2 in Supplement 1).
Delirium-Related Adverse Outcomes
Among studies reporting preoperative prognostic factors as-
sociated with developing postoperative delirium, postopera-
tive delirium was significantly associated with postoperative
mortality, postoperative complications, length of hospitaliza-
tion, and discharge to an institution or care facility. The asso-
ciation between postoperative delirium and subsequent hospi-
tal readmission was reported in two studies (Table 4 and
eFigure 1 in Supplement 1).26, 44
DISCUSSION
Our systematic review demonstrated that postoperative delirium
occurs frequently in the setting of elective surgery among older
adults (NNF = 6). We also identified prognostic factors associ-
ated with the risk of postoperative delirium in this patient pop-
ulation. Common geriatric syndromes, including cognitive and
functional impairment, were shown to be important prognostic
factors that are identifiable during the preoperative assessment of
older adults. Findings from our systematic review support the
targeting of potentially modifiable (e.g. smoking, frailty) and
protective (caregiver support) factors to optimize care. Further-
more, we showed that delirium is associated with adverse out-
comes that can severely impact both the quality and quantity of
life experienced by older adults following elective surgery.
In addition to non-pharmacological delirium prevention
strategies that have demonstrated effectiveness in both the
medical and surgical settings, other potential targets for inter-
vention were identified in this study that warrant further re-
search.6, 7 For example, smoking status, frailty, and the use of
psychotropic medications are potentially modifiable prognos-
tic factors that were associated with developing postoperative
delirium. Interventions for preoperative smoking cessation

plications.67 Direct patient education has also been effective at

Watt et al.: Older Adults Risk of Delirium
JGIM
 Although some would argue that there are no effective inter-
ventions for the treatment of frailty, researchers have shown that
the progression of frailty is potentially preventable.69, 70 Indeed,
multicomponent interventions aimed at improving nutrition,
physical fitness, and cognition have shown promise in reversing
frailty.71 Even exercise-based interventions alone have been
shown to improve frailty status.72, 73 The application of an
exercise-based intervention in the preoperative setting, termed
Bprehabilitation^, is currently being studied to determine wheth-
er frail patients in the perioperative setting can derive similar
benefit.74 If such an intervention proves successful, frailty could
be identified in the preoperative clinic in order to offer patients
prehabilitation in anticipation of their elective surgery.
Importantly, the availability of a caregiver in the perioper-
ative period was shown to be protective against developing
postoperative delirium. This is consistent with a randomized
trial in older adults with hip fractures, which showed that a
non-pharmacological multicomponent intervention provided
by caregivers in the perioperative setting was associated with a
decreased incidence of delirium.75 Previous work on the sub-
jective experience and satisfaction of patients during the peri-
operative period has also highlighted the provision of infor-
mation and education as very important to improving patient
care.54 This information should be communicated to patients
and their caregivers as part of their preoperative clinic visit,
and this finding should potentially be added to clinical practice
guidelines concerning the perioperative care of older adults.48
In contrast to recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses on
adverse postoperative outcomes among older adults, which
have included patients with various indications for surgery such
as hip fracture or other emergency procedures, we targeted older
adults undergoing elective surgery because of the potential to
intervene in the preoperative setting to improve patient out-
comes.53, 55 Contrary to our finding that smoking status was
associated with developing postoperative delirium, Scholz et al.
found no such association among patients aged 50 years and
older undergoing any elective or emergency gastrointestinal
surgery; however, their result was based on just two studies
and 218 patients, while our meta-analysis included nine studies
and 2467 patients.53 There are several potential explanations for
the association between smoking status and postoperative de-
lirium, including nicotine withdrawal during hospitalization, or
perhaps these patients have a higher burden of cardiometabolic
disease with as yet undiagnosed vascular cognitive impairment.
For example, greater agitation was reported in a study of inten-
sive care unit patients experiencing nicotine withdrawal; how-
ever, the association between smoking and delirium remains
unclear in the broader body of literature outside the perioper-
ative setting.76, 77 Similar to our current study, a meta-analysis
by Witlox et al. found that patients who developed postopera-
tive delirium experienced increased postoperative mortality and
institutionalization.4
There were limitations in our study’s review process. First,
only studies that were published in English were included in

 this review to increase feasibility, but our findings are likely
generalizable given the number of geographical regions rep-
resented in our systematic review. Second, there was substan-
tial heterogeneity among studies for some outcomes, which
could not always be adequately explored given a limited
number of studies and a lack of individual patient-level data.
There were also limitations in the studies themselves. The
methodological quality assessment demonstrated that a num-
ber of studies reported varying lengths and intensity of follow-
up, which may have impacted the incidence of delirium
reported. Although some studies reported only unadjusted
effect measures, which limited their ability to account for
possible confounders, our sensitivity analyses demonstrated
that our findings were largely consistent when only study-
level effect estimates adjusted for important confounders were
included in the meta-analyses.
Our study had a number of strengths. Forty-one studies and
over 9000 patients were included in our systematic review and
meta-analysis, which allowed us to investigate a number of
possible protective and predisposing factors. The hypothesis-
generating nature of this study allowed for the identification of
important prognostic factors, including the availability of
caregiver support, which has potentially important clinical
and policy implications for patient care.
Insummary, postoperative delirium is a common (NNF = 6),
yet preventable, complication experienced by older adults
undergoing elective surgery that can lead to prolonged hospi-
talization, the inability to return home, and death. This sys-
tematic review and meta-analysis identified protective and
modifiable prognostic factors, including smoking, frailty, and
psychotropic medication use, which should be further studied
to develop interventions aimed at mitigating potential harm.
