 Analgesia and Opioids:
A Pharmacogenetics Shortlist for Implementation
in Clinical Practice
Maja Matic,1,2 Saskia N. de Wildt,2,3 Dick Tibboel,2 and Ron H.N. van Schaik1*
BACKGROUND: The use of opioids to alleviate pain is
complicated by the risk of severe adverse events and the
large variability in dose requirements. Pharmacogenetics
(PGx) could possibly be used to tailor pain medication
based on an individual’s genetic background. Many po-
tential genetic markers have been described, and the im-
portance of genetic predisposition in opioid efficacy and
toxicity has been demonstrated in knockout mouse
models and human twin studies. Such predictors are
especially of value for neonates and young children, in
whom the assessment of efficacy or side effects is com-
plicated by the inability of the patient to communicate
this properly. The current problem is determining
which of the many potential candidates to focus on for
clinical implementation.
CONTENT: We systematically searched publications on
PGx for opioids in 5 databases, aiming to identify PGx
markers with sufficient robust data and high enough oc-
currence for potential clinical application. The initial
search yielded 4257 unique citations, eventually resulting
in 852 relevant articles covering 24 genes. From these
genes, we evaluated the evidence and selected the most
promising 10 markers: cytochrome P450 family 2 sub-
family D member 6 (CYP2D6), cytochrome P450 family
3 subfamily A member 4 (CYP3A4), cytochrome P450
family 3 subfamily A member 5 (CYP3A5), UDP glucu-
ronosyltransferase family 2 member B7 (UGT2B7), ATP
binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1), ATP
binding cassette subfamily C member 3 (ABCC3), solute
carrier family 22 member 1 (SLC22A1), opioid receptor
kappa 1 (OPRM1), catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT),
and potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily J mem-
ber 6 (KCNJ6). Treatment guidelines based on genotype
are already available only for CYP2D6.
SUMMARY: The application of PGx in the management of
pain with opioids has the potential to improve therapy.
We provide a shortlist of 10 genes that are the most
promising markers for clinical use in this context.

Opioid administration to patients with moderate to se-
vere pain is not without risk. Side effects that may occur
with the use of opioids are constipation, nausea, vomit-
ing, sedation, dry mouth, or worse, respiratory depres-
sion and delirium. An important obstacle for the use of
opioids is the large and unpredictable variability in dose
required to reach adequate treatment (1). Opioids are
currently dosed based on the patient’s clinical presenta-
tion, as judged by self-reporting of the patient and/or
by nurses using validated pain scales. This is a trial and
error approach, starting from a common starting dose.
This approach results in an increased risk of side ef-
fects in some patients, whereas other patients may be
undertreated.
Opioids
In the treatment of moderate acute or chronic pain, a
patient will be given opioids when acetaminophen or
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents do not provide
sufficient analgesia. The severity/duration of the pain and
the patient’s clinical summary (e.g., potential drug–drug
interactions, hepatic/renal function) determine the
choice of the agent (2). The weak opioids codeine and
tramadol are often added to nonopioid compounds to
treat pain, while severe pain is mostly treated with mor-
phine. Alternatives for morphine are oxycodone, hydro-
codone, and fentanyl, which have different pharmacoki-
netic (PK)4 profiles. Fentanyl, alfentanil, remifentanil,
and sufentanil with a rapid Cmax and short half-life are

 selected when rapid onset of action is required, as is the
case with acute procedural pain (2). Weak opioids and
the more potent compounds appear to carry comparable
risk for adverse events, such as respiratory depression. In
addition, tramadol has been associated with the develop-
ment of the serotonin syndrome due to its pharmacolog-
ical action of serotonin reuptake (3).
Pharmacogenetics
Many research projects have focused on unraveling the
interindividual variability in opioid response to improve
pain treatment. Pharmacogenetics (PGx) is one of the
most promising disciplines in this respect. It is assumed
that specific inherited genetic variations can predict a
patient’s response to drugs. For example, 12%–60% of
the variability in alfentanil response can be explained by
genetics, as illustrated in an experimental pain study in
twins showing that the strength of the correlation be-
tween genetics and thermal pain depended on the pain
stimulus applied (4). From the findings of transgenic
knockout mouse studies, over 400 genes have been im-
plicated (5). Transgenic knockout mouse studies, candi-
date gene analyses, and genome-wide association studies
in humans all point toward a genetic component in pain
and efficacy of pain treatment, thus confirming that PGx
may help improve patient care.
Although reviews on this topic have summarized the
various scientific findings, they typically have not focused
on translation into clinical practice. To answer this gap,
we performed a structured literature search on all publi-
cations on genes in the pain literature and identified
those PGx markers that, in our opinion, may be relevant
for further validation for use in clinical practice.
Methods
Using a broad range of search criteria (see Table 1 in the
Data Supplement that accompanies the online version of
this review at http://www.clinchem.org/content/vol63/
issue7) we searched the Embase, Medline, Web-of-
Science, Cochrane, and Google Scholar databases, which
initially yielded 5898 citations. Removal of duplicate ci-
tations yielded 4257 unique hits. After exclusion of arti-
cles in languages other than English, non–peer reviewed
hits (poster presentations), papers focusing on opioid
therapy for addiction or the phenotype pain without ad-
dressing the effect on opioid therapy, 852 articles remained,
covering 24 genes [ATP binding cassette subfamily B mem-

member B7 (UGT2B7)]. In vitro studies, animal studies,
case reports, candidate gene and genome wide ap-
proaches were included. Each of these papers was assessed
on the following criteria: (a) sufficient evidence to war-
rant a true effect (several independent studies finding the
same effect); (b) minor allele frequency (MAF) of 5% in
the white population (high enough to be clinically rele-
vant for screening purposes); (c) the paper included novel
findings for which the first criterion obviously could not
yet be applied but was interesting because of the potential
impact based on a mechanistic point of view. This ap-
proach led to a shortlist of 10 genes that we deemed to
have the highest potential for application in the clinical
field.
PK-Related Candidate Genes
CYP2D6
The most frequently addressed candidate gene in the lit-
erature on pain is the highly polymorphic CYP2D6. This
phase-I liver enzyme is involved in the biological activa-
tion of codeine into morphine and tramadol into

 O-desmethyltramadol, and also in the conversion of oxy-
codone to the active metabolite oxymorphone and hy-
drocodone to hydromorphone (2). Genetic variability in
CYP2D6 can be translated into 4 phenotype groups,
namely ultrarapid metabolizer (UM), extensive (or nor-
mal) metabolizer (EM), intermediate metabolizer (IM),
and poor metabolizer (PM) (6). Over 100 different
alleles have been discovered, of which approximately
25% lead to total loss of activity in vivo and 6% result
in decreased activity (7). In the white population,
5%–10% of individuals are a PM and 2%–4% a UM.
In the Asian population, CYP2D6 PMs are less com-
mon, but IMs are more common, with up to 20% of
the Japanese population carrying the *10 decreased
activity allele (6). In the African population, the fre-
quently occurring *17 and *29 alleles also lead to an
IM phenotype. These alleles are virtually absent in the
white population (6).
Several case reports have described severe and even
lethal adverse events in individuals with genetically im-
paired CYP2D6 metabolism who are treated with co-
deine and tramadol (8). Most alarmingly, a 13-day-old
infant died from morphine toxicity via breastfeeding by
the CYP2D6 genetically impaired mother (9). Another
report concerns an adult with a CYP2D6 UM status who
in association with a CYP3A4 drug–drug interaction and
reduced kidney function experienced life-threatening ad-
verse events while treated with codeine (25 mg 3 times
daily) (10). Besides codeine, tramadol-related respiratory
depression has been reported in a child with obstructive
sleep apnea (11) and in an adult with kidney failure (12);
both had a CYP2D6 gene duplication.
Many studies have analyzed associations between
CYP2D6 genotype and codeine PK and pharmacody-
namic (PD) outcomes. Platforms used for CYP2D6
genotyping were PCR–restriction fragment length poly-
morphism (PCR-RFLP), SNaPshot™, TaqMan®, or
the European Conformity–In Vitro Diagnostic Medical
Devices (CE-IVD)-approved INFINITI® system (see
online Supplemental Table 2). Taking into account the
available evidence, the Clinical Pharmacogenetic Imple-
mentation Consortium has published clinical recom-
mendations for codeine dosing based on CYP2D6 geno-
type (13). Both CYP2D6 UMs and PMs should avoid
codeine: in the former group a rise in morphine forma-
tion will increase toxicity risk, while in the latter group no
analgesic effect will occur due to reduced morphine for-
mation. Although the evidence is less strong for the other
opioids, caution should especially be taken with the use
of tramadol, and also oxycodone and hydrocodone, in
CYP2D6 genetically impaired individuals (13). The
Clinical Pharmacogenetic Implementation Consortium
guideline highlights that the CYP2D6 genotype informa-
tion should be considered together with other patient
factors in the therapeutic choice for the individual pa-
tient. The safety concerns with regard to genetically im-
paired CYP2D6 metabolism are further stressed by inclu-
sion of this information in the drug label of codeine,
mentioning that codeine is contraindicated in individu-
als with known CYP2D6 UM status (8). Based on the
extensive evidence for this gene, the availability of guide-
lines for healthcare professionals, and the fact that active
metabolites of codeine and tramadol are formed by this
enzyme, this is a highly suitable biomarker for improving
pain therapy in the clinic.
CYP3A4/A5
Two other relevant phase-I enzymes in opioid metabo-
lism are cytochrome P450 family 3 subfamily A members
4 and 5 (CYP3A4 and CYP3A5). These enzymes are
especially relevant for inactivation of fentanyl, sufentanil,
and alfentanil, where the inactive metabolites are formed
via N-dealkylation (14). In contrast to CYP2D6,
CYP3A4 is involved in the formation of the nonactive
metabolites of codeine and tramadol, norcodeine, and
N-desmethyltramadol,
respectively.
For
oxycodone,
80% of this drug is converted by CYP3A4 to the nonac-
tive metabolite noroxycodone (2).
In the CYP3A4 gene, over 20 variant alleles have
been discovered, most of which are relatively rare with an
MAF � 0.01 (10). The major exception is the *22 allele
(rs35599367; 15389C�T), with an MAF of 5%–7% in
the white population, which encodes decreased CYP3A4
enzymatic activity (15). Regarding fentanyl, in a Euro-
pean cancer cohort (n � 620) it was shown that genetic
variability in both CYP3A4*22 and CYP3A5*3 influ-
enced transdermal fentanyl metabolism (16). The time
elapsed between patch application and sample collection
was not documented, but the length of the interval could
have diluted the genetic effect and may have resulted
in only a small percentage in fentanyl PK variability
explained by CYP3A4/A5 genetics (16). A recent
metaanalysis in the postoperative setting, which for
that matter did not include the CYP3A4*22 allele,
concluded that the CYP3A4*1G allele (rs2242480;
20230G�A) is associated with lower fentanyl con-
sumption in individuals carrying the *1G allele (n �
141) compared to patients carrying the wild-type allele
(n � 178) (17). This is in line with a Chinese study on
human liver microsomes (n � 88) in which decreased
mRNA and the metabolic rate of fentanyl correlated
with the *1G allele (18).
Regarding the CYP3A5 gene, the most frequent
genetic variant in white individuals is the inactive
CYP3A5*3 allele (rs776746; 6986A�G). Approximately
80% of white individuals are homozygous carriers of this
allele and as a consequence do not express this enzyme
(nonexpressors) (19). CYP3A5 expressors who carry at
least one *1 allele are thus expected to have an increased
elimination of fentanyl compared to the general popula-

 tion and therefore might require higher doses. Although
a higher norfentanyl/fentanyl metabolic ratio was ob-
served in carriers of the CYP3A5*1 allele while on trans-
dermal fentanyl (16), a metaanalysis on postoperative
pain nevertheless failed to show an altered fentanyl con-
sumption in carriers of this allele (17). Also, alfentanil
PK and PD in healthy individuals (n � 99) were not
found to be related with the CYP3A5*3 allele [see online
Supplemental Table 3; CYP3A5, reference (1)]. The
genotype-phenotype relations between these CYP3A4
and CYP3A5 alleles with fentanyl or alfentanil PK and
PD have not been addressed in the pediatric population,
in which full activity is reached around 1 year of age (20).
Genetic variability in these 2 genes is less extensive
compared to that for the CYP2D6 gene. Most variants in
these genes, except the ones mentioned previously, have a
low MAF in different ethnic populations and are there-
fore less relevant for screening purposes in clinical prac-
tice. As long as the mentioned CYP3A4/5 genetic variants
are tested concordantly, leaving out the rare alleles is
likely not to have affected the outcomes of these studies.
In addition, when initial findings in mostly small candi-
date gene cohorts were inconclusive, the large cancer co-
hort (n � 620) and the metaanalysis (n � 319) did
illustrate an effect on fentanyl PK and PD, respectively,
suggesting a study power issue as a cause instead. Because
these enzymes are highly relevant for elimination of fen-
tanyl via bioinactivation to norfentanyl, studies are
needed that assess if genotype-based dose alterations re-
sult in less pain and fewer adverse events.
UGT2B7
The phase-II enzyme UGT2B7 is involved in the conver-
sion of morphine into morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G)
and the active metabolite morphine-6-glucuronide
(M6G), with a formation ratio of 9:1. While UGT2B7 is
the primary enzyme involved in M3G formation,
UGT2B7, UGT1A1, and UGT1A8 are most likely in-
volved in the conversion from morphine to M6G (21).
The most described UGT2B7 single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) 802C�T (rs7439366) leads to a
2-fold decrease in transcriptional activity in hepatoma
and colon cell lines (22). This SNP is in complete reverse
linkage disequilibrium with 6 promoter situated SNPs
(�1306G�A; �1299C�T; 1112C�T; �900A�G;
�327G�A; �161C�T: *2 haplotype, MAF 50%). In
this *2 haplotype, SNP –900G�A [also known as
�842G�A (rs7438135)] is believed to be the causative
variation (22). In agreement with the in vitro data, the
metabolite/morphine metabolic ratio was lower in (n �
20) �842G allele carriers with sickle cell disease (23).
This effect was confirmed for morphine PK in a pilot
study (n � 15) with preterm newborns (24), but in a
larger cohort of older children (n � 146) this variant was
not found to be related to morphine clearance (25).
Adult
Japanese
patients
(n
�
32)
carrying
the
UGT2B7*2 allele reported less nausea while on oral mor-
phine therapy for cancer pain than did patients carrying
the wild-type UGT2B7 allele (26). However, not all clin-
ical studies found an effect of these UGT2B7 polymor-
phisms on morphine PK or PD [see online Supplemental
Table 3; UGT2B7, references (1–4)].
Failure to find the effect of this genetic variant could
be due to confounding by other genetic variants. A study
that used human livers from white individuals (n �
54) identified a particular haplotype associated with
UGT2B7 activity (27). This haplotype, with an MAF of
12%, included the intronic variant IVS1 � 985A�G
(rs62298861), which was consistently correlated with in-
creased mRNA expression and increased glucuronida-
tion. More research is needed to address the relative im-
portance of this variant in addition to the previously
mentioned UGT2B7*2 allele. Also, although the nega-
tive studies [see online Supplemental Table 3; UGT2B7,
references (1–4)] were usually larger (n � 70–175) and
assessed multiple UGT2B7 SNPs by means of sequenc-
ing, probably even larger cohorts would be required to
provide enough power to detect a significant hit among
these variants. Moreover, genetic variability in other
UGT enzymes has been associated with morphine PK.
Therefore UGT2B7 variants should be considered to-
gether with UGT1A1 and UGT1A8 genetic variability.
ABCB1
The ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 1
(ABCB1), also referred to as P-glycoprotein or Multidrug
Resistance Protein 1, is known from its role as an efflux
pump in the intestine and at the blood–brain barrier. In
vitro and in vivo studies have shown that morphine, fen-
tanyl, and oxycodone are substrates for the ABCB1 trans-
porter (28). Although for the ABCB1 gene over 8000
SNPs are reported, only 4% of those in fact have a MAF
above 5%.
The SNP 3435C�T (rs1045642) has been studied
most. Healthy individuals genotyped as 3435TT showed
a 2-fold decrease in duodenal expression (29). Assuming
in addition that there is lower expression at the blood–
brain barrier in 3435TT genotyped individuals, this
finding fits with the observed higher morphine concen-
trations found in the cerebrospinal fluid after intravenous
injection (30). Consequently, lower opioid doses might
be needed in these patients since they would risk side
effects on normal dosages. While lower opioid consump-
tion has indeed been found in the postoperative setting
(n � 152) in 3435TT genotyped individuals (31), this is
not a uniform finding [see online Supplemental Table 3;
ABCB1, references (1–5)]. Sample sizes in these mostly
postoperative studies that failed to find a significant effect
of the 3435C�T variant were comparable with that of
the previous positive study (32). Therefore, this result

 could have been a false-positive finding. Additionally,
the metaanalysis on postoperative pain (including 7
clinical studies with 1632 unique patients) was also
unable to illustrate an effect of SNP 3435C�T and
2677G�T/A on opioid requirement (17). An in-
creased risk for morphine-induced nausea and vomit-
ing was reported in whites with the 3435TT genotype
undergoing colorectal surgery (32). A higher fre-
quency of opioid-related adverse events such as sweat-
ing and sedation was reported in 3435TT genotyped
individuals receiving remifentanil for spinal fusion
surgery (33). Other SNPs in ABCB1, 1236C�T
(rs1128503) and 2677G�T/A (rs2032582), have
also been found to be related to adverse events
(26, 32, 34, 35). Other studies, including one in a
pediatric population, could not confirm this increased
risk for adverse events in carriers of the 3435T allele
[see online Supplemental Table 3; ABCB1, references
(5–8)].
The 3435C�T, 2677G�T/A, and 1236C�T
SNPs are in linkage disequilibrium and are thus often
found in the same patient. Overall, studies performed on
these 3 ABCB1 SNPs have demonstrated inconsistent
findings, implicating some effect but also illustrating that
other genetic or nongenetic factors play a role. Recently,
several new polymorphisms in this transporter gene have
been assessed in relation with opioid-induced respiratory
depression, in which the SNP rs9282564, with a fre-
quency of 11% in white individuals, was associated with
an increased risk for developing this adverse event and
correlated with a prolonged hospital stay in a study on
263 children (36).
ABCC3
The ABCC3 gene encodes the ATP binding cassette sub-
family C member 3 transporter, also known as Multidrug
Resistance Protein 3. A study in mice genetically lacking
ABCC3 revealed that this transporter is involved in the
efflux of M3G and M6G from the liver to the blood-
stream (37). In a study with 103 adult white individuals,
51 genetic variations were discovered, but only the pro-
moter SNP �211C�T (rs4793665) was associated with
significantly decreased ABCC3 mRNA expression and
alterations in the binding of transcription factors (38). A
study with 105 children undergoing adenotonsillectomy
indicated that the �211C�T polymorphism was associ-
ated with lower M3G and M6G plasma concentrations
(39). All 12 patients with undetectable M6G concentra-
tions were carriers of the T-allele, which is in line with in
vitro data from Lang et al. (38). Findings of studies on
the developmental pattern of the ABCC3 transporter
during childhood are inconsistent. Based on the pro-
teomic study that did illustrate a “low to high” develop-
mental pattern, adult protein expression values are
reached within the first 5 postnatal weeks (40). There-
fore, it would be worthwhile to assess if the reported
effect of the �211C�T variant on morphine PK could
also be found in the neonatal population. More studies
are needed to confirm this effect on the metabolism of
morphine. Additionally, the ABCC3 gene requires fur-
ther screening for relevant genetic variants in other, non-
Caucasian populations.
SLC22A1
The Organic Cation Transporter 1, encoded by the
SLC22A1 gene, is primarily present on the sinusoidal
membrane of hepatocytes. It is responsible for the uptake
of positively charged compounds at physiological pH,
such as morphine and the active metabolite of tramadol,
O-desmethyltramadol (41). The role of SLC22A1 loss-
of-function polymorphisms (*2, *3, *4,*5, *6) on trama-
dol PK and PD was emphasized by the finding of in-
creased O-desmethyltramadol plasma concentrations
and prolonged contraction of the eye pupils (PD marker
for opioid effect) in healthy volunteers (42). Another
study in 205 adult postoperative patients on patient-
controlled analgesia found that those with 2 inactive
SLC22A1 alleles had higher O-desmethyltramadol area
under the concentration curve (AUC) and lower tra-
madol consumption during the first 24 h after surgery
(43). In line with these observations, O-desmethyltra-
madol/tramadol metabolic ratios in newborn infants
carrying the SLC22A1 low activity genotype were
higher than those in infants carrying 2 SLC22A1 wild-
type alleles (44). Organic Cation OCT1 is expressed
from the first postnatal day and increases quickly in
the following months (45, 46), which fits with the
found genotype–phenotype correlation.
In healthy volunteers with the previously mentioned
deficient SLC22A1 alleles, an increase of 56% in mor-
phine AUC after codeine administration was found (47).
The association of these deficient SLC22A1 alleles with
morphine was confirmed in a pediatric cohort with 220
children aged 6–15 years. The children with 2 loss-of-
function alleles treated with intravenous morphine for
postoperative pain had significantly lower clearance com-
pared with patients with wild-type alleles (39). The au-
thors proposed that these genetic variants could explain
why children with a white background experienced more
adverse events than African American children, in whom
the variant alleles are less frequent. SLC22A1 deficient
alleles may be especially relevant for patients carrying the
CYP2D6 UM status: both genetic variants lead to an
increase in morphine and O-desmethyltramadol plasma
concentrations and subsequently increase toxicity risk.
The list of SNPs addressed in studies should be ex-
tended based on Seitz et al. (48) to also cover genetic
variability in other ethnic populations than the Cau-
casian population.

 PD-Related Candidate Genes
OPRM1
Opioids such as morphine and fentanyl exert their anal-
gesic effect primarily via the �-opioid receptor (MOR),
encoded by the OPRM1 gene. Despite the large amount
of genetic variability in OPRM1 (�700 SNPs with MAF
�5%), only a handful of variants have been addressed in
clinical studies. With a relatively high MAF among
whites (15%) and Asians (40%), 118A�G (Asn40Asp,
rs1799971) seems the most prominent variant (49). In
vivo studies on 118A�G have illustrated reduced signal
transduction for the receptor carrying this variant, re-
duced OPRM1 expression, and reduced binding affinity
of morphine and its active metabolite M6G. On the
other hand, higher binding affinity for endogenous opi-
oids has been found, as discussed in (49). More recently,
2 independent metaanalyses on postoperative pain in
adults, sample size 4607 (49) and 3144 (18) respectively,
showed that carriers of the 118A�G variant have indeed
higher opioid requirements (17, 50) and a lower risk for
adverse events (17).
Like morphine, alfentanil and oxycodone display
lower affinity/potency for the MOR in individuals hav-
ing the 118G allele [see online Supplemental Table 3;
OPRM1, references (1–3)]. A metaanalysis on the use of
fentanyl for labor pain found a lower requirement in
carriers of the minor 118G allele [see online Supplemen-
tal Table 3; OPRM1, reference (4)]. The effect of this
genetic variant seems inconclusive for codeine, tramadol,
and sufentanil [see online Supplemental Table 3;
OPRM1, references (5–12)]. Children who were born
with the neonatal abstinence syndrome due to the in
utero exposure of opioids and who carried the 118G
allele had milder symptoms, illustrated by a shorter hos-
pital stay and lower risk for any treatment of neonatal
abstinence syndrome (51). Our study in newborn infants
illustrated an increased risk for rescue analgesia with mor-
phine while being on the ventilator in carriers of the
OPRM1 118G allele in combination with the COMT
472GG genotype (52). A Japanese cohort with adult
patients undergoing major abdominal surgery assessed 5
tag SNPs (118A�G, IVS2 � 691G�C; rs2075572,
IVS3 � 5953G�A; rs599548, IVS3 � 8449A�G,
TAA�2109A�G), of which only 118A�G was signifi-
cantly associated with opioid consumption (53). In sum-
mary, based on the extensive literature, the 118A�G
variant seems to be a potential biomarker for use in clin-
ical practice. However, we need to elucidate the magni-
tude of its effect on opioid response compared to other
genetic variants (e.g., CYP2D6, SLC22A1). Also, the
seemingly different effect per type of opioid requires
more research.
COMT
Next to OPRM1 and CYP2D6, the COMT gene is one
of the most frequently analyzed candidate genes in the
pain field. This gene codes for the catechol-O-
methyltransferase (COMT) enzyme, which by regula-
tion of MOR expression is involved in numerous physi-
ological functions including pain perception. This
relationship between COMT activity and MOR protein
expression levels has been illustrated with the COMT
VAL158MET (472G�A, rs4680) variation in post-
mortem human brains. Individuals genotyped with
MET158MET (rs4680) had higher MOR protein ex-
pression and lower met-enkephalin concentrations (54).
In line with these findings, MET158MET-genotyped
patients required less opioid for cancer pain (55–58) and
postoperative pain (59–62) or showed fewer side effects
(63). In line with this protective effect of the rs4680
polymorphism, preterm infants with the MET158 allele
sooner reached a pain-free state after remifentanil or mor-
phine premedication for endotracheal intubation (64).
In an additional study, ventilated newborns who carried
the MET158 allele with the OPRM1 118AA genotype
were less likely to require rescue morphine (52). Other
studies, however, did not find an association with pain
and or opioid requirement [see online Supplemental Ta-
ble 3; COMT, references (1–3)].
Furthermore, a haplotype approach including the
472G�A variation has been applied. Based on SNPs
rs6269, rs4633, rs4818, and rs4680, 3 functional haplo-
types have been defined, namely low pain sensitivity
(GCGG), average pain sensitivity (ATCA), and high
pain sensitivity (ACCG) (65). More recently, the low
pain sensitivity haplotype has been associated with the
highest pain score and opioid consumption in the post-
operative pain setting (60). In another postoperative co-
hort, the average pain sensitivity haplotype was found to
be related to the lowest opioid requirement (62). While
extensive data has been generated on COMT genetic vari-
ability and opioid therapy, more research is needed due to
the controversial findings.
KCNJ6
The G protein–activated inwardly rectifying potassium 2
(GIRK2 or Kir3.2) channel, encoded by the KCNJ6
gene, is one of the downstream signaling effectors of the
MOR. The effect of �1250G�A (rs6517442) and
1032A�G (rs2070995) on postoperative analgesia was
assessed in adult patients undergoing gastrectomy and
colectomy for gastric and colorectal cancer (66). Ho-
mozygous 1032A allele patients and patients carrying the
haplotype �1250G/1032A more often required rescue
analgesia. Lower KCNJ6 mRNA expression levels were
found in 1032AA individuals, while the �1250G�A
SNP did not alter this expression (66). Another study on
1032A�G with 352 chronic pain patients showed a

 trend in the same direction (67). In contrast to the adult
postoperative study with the combined �1250G/1032A
haplotype (66), preterm infants with the �1250AA ge-
notype who received either morphine or remifentanil
needed more time to reach a pain-free state after endo-
tracheal intubation (64). In an explorative analysis in 311
adult white patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty,
both �1250G�A and 1032A�G were not associated with
opioiddose(68).Ofthe69SNPsidentifiedandanalyzedin

 SNPs were combined in a genetic risk score and validated in
acohortwithhealthyindividualsandpatientswithlowback
pain. Several SNPs in the KCNJ6 gene have been reported
to be related to opioid response but negative findings have
been published as well. Therefore, the functional conse-
quences of the mentioned variants and their relative effects
on either mRNA or protein expression need to be further
studied.
Conclusions
Our extensive literature search resulted in a shortlist of 10
genes (Table 1) that merit further study in a clinical set-
ting. The most solid evidence of a clinically relevant PGx
effect on the analgesic treatment with opioids is available
for genetic variation in CYP2D6, COMT, SLC22A1, and
the genetic variant OPRM1 118A�G. As clinical guide-
lines for codeine and CYP2D6 genotyping have been
formulated (13) and CYP2D6 genotyping has been suc-
cessfully implemented in pediatric clinical practice (69),
PGx seems promising to personalize opioid therapy.
CYP2D6 genotyping is complicated when genome-wide
association study arrays are used. However, the studies
addressing CYP2D6 genotype and codeine therapy did
not use genome-wide array-based platforms (see online
Supplemental Table 2). Mostly, PCR-RFLP, SNaPshot,
TaqMan, or the CE-IVD INFINITI array were used. For
the other 6 genes, more evidence is needed. Prospective
studies comparing current treatment strategies with a
genotype-based strategy as well as cost-effectiveness stud-
ies are required before preemptive testing of these genes
in clinical practice is undertaken.
Less evidence is available for the role of PGx in an-
algesic treatment with opioids in the pediatric popula-
tion, with the exception of the CYP2D6 gene. Only a
handful of papers have focused on other PGx markers of
opioids in this population (24, 39, 51, 52, 64, 70–73).
In fact, PGx is age independent as far as the effect on
enzymatic activity is concerned, yet if a gene is not ex-
pressed in childhood a genetic polymorphism will have
no clinical impact. Thus, we emphasize that next to PGx,
ontogeny is also of importance in this age group. New-
borns and infants cannot self-report pain and are more
prone to opioid-induced severe adverse events such as
respiratory depression (74), which stresses the need for a
more personalized approach. The neonatal period until
infancy is the most interesting in view of the develop-
mental changes that occur in this period. At birth and
shortly thereafter major changes are seen in the activity of
liver enzymes (75) and transporters (76). For example, in
the second postpartum week undetectable CYP2D6 ex-
pression was observed in 13% of liver samples (77). This
correlates with the expected 10% of CYP2D6 PMs in the
adult population (77). In addition, based on adult data
the OPRM1 118A�G variant seems promising for appli-
cation in clinical practice. Studies assessing whether these
findings apply to pain phenotypes in different pediatric
age ranges are needed, as well as studies on the clinical
consequence of SLC22A1 genetic variability in the pedi-
atric population. Sufficient evidence on tramadol and
morphine PK with SLC22A1 genetics has been found in
adult and pediatric populations, with all studies replicat-
ing and confirming previous findings (39, 42, 44, 47).
The application of PGx in the management of pain
with opioids certainly has the potential to improve ther-
apy. There is a shortlist of candidate genes that are rele-
vant in the pain treatment with opioids, but additional
studies are needed that focus on clinical use and on young
children.
