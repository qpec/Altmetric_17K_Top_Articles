SUMMARY
Hepatic glucose release into the circulation is vital for
brain function and survival during periods of fasting
and is modulated by an array of hormones that
precisely regulate plasma glucose levels. We have
identified a fasting-induced protein hormone that
modulates hepatic glucose release. It is the C-termi-
nal cleavage product of profibrillin, and we name it
Asprosin. Asprosin is secreted by white adipose, cir-
culates at nanomolar levels, and is recruited to the
liver, where it activates the G protein-cAMP-PKA
pathway, resulting in rapid glucose release into the
circulation. Humans and mice with insulin resistance
show pathologically elevated plasma asprosin, and
its loss of function via immunologic or genetic
means has a profound glucose- and insulin-lowering
effect secondary to reduced hepatic glucose release.
Asprosin represents a glucogenic protein hormone,
and therapeutically targeting it may be beneficial in
type II diabetes and metabolic syndrome.
INTRODUCTION
Hormones, their receptors, and the associated signaling path-
ways make compelling drug targets because of their wide-
ranging biological significance (Behrens and Bromer, 1958). Pro-
tein hormones, as a subclass, have defining characteristics.
They usually (but not always) result from cleavage of a larger pro-
protein and, upon secretion, traffic via the circulation to a target
organ. There they bind a target cell using a cell-surface receptor,
displaying high affinity, saturability, and ability to be competed
off. They stimulate rapid signal transduction using a second-
messenger system, followed by a measurable physiological
consequence. Given the brain’s strict dependence on glucose
as a fuel, plasma glucose levels are precisely regulated by an
array of hormones (Aronoff et al., 2004). Some are secreted in
response to nutritional cues, while others respond to glucose
itself, producing highly coordinated and precise regulation of
circulating glucose levels. Perturbations in this system can
cause pathological alteration in glucose levels, often with severe
consequences.
We have discovered a protein hormone that regulates glucose
homeostasis. It is the C-terminal cleavage product of profibrillin
(encoded by FBN1). Its absence in humans results in a unique
pattern of metabolic dysregulation that includes partial lipodys-
trophy, accompanied by reduced plasma insulin, while maintain-
ing euglycemia. We name it Asprosin, after the Greek word for
white (aspros), because of the reduction in subcutaneous white
adipose tissue that is displayed by asprosin-deficient patients
and because white adipose tissue appears to be a source of
plasma asprosin.
RESULTS
Neonatal Progeroid Syndrome Mutations Reduce
Plasma Insulin Levels while Maintaining Euglycemia in
Humans
Neonatal progeroid syndrome (NPS) was first described in 1977
(OMIM: 264090) and is characterized by congenital, partial
lipodystrophy, predominantly affecting the face and extremities
(O’Neill et al., 2007). Although NPS patients appear progeroid
because of facial dysmorphic features and reduced subcutane-
ous fat, the term is a misnomer as the patients do not display
accelerated aging. We identified two unrelated individuals with
NPS. We examined their glucose and insulin homeostasis status,
since both partial and generalized lipodystrophic disorders are
frequently associated with insulin resistance (Bindlish et al.,
2015). Contrary to this notion, overnight-fasted plasma insulin
levels from our NPS patients were 2-fold lower than unaffected
subjects, while maintaining euglycemia (Figure 1A).
Whole-exome and Sanger sequencing identified de novo,
heterozygous 30 truncating mutations in FBN1 in both patients
(Figures 1B and 1C). Upon reaching the genetic diagnosis, we
searched the literature for similar cases and discovered five
single-patient case reports of NPS associated with FBN1 30 trun-
cating mutations (Goldblatt et al., 2011; Graul-Neumann et al.,
2010; Horn and Robinson, 2011; Jacquinet et al., 2014; Taken-
ouchi et al., 2013). All seven subjects, including the two reported
herein, were diagnosed with NPS, and all have truncating

 mutations within a 71-bp segment at the 30 end of the FBN1 cod-
ing region, displaying tight genotype-phenotype correlation (Fig-
ure 1D). All seven mutations occur 30 to the last 50 nt of the
penultimate exon and are therefore predicted to escape mRNA
nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), leading to expression of a
mutant, truncated profibrillin protein (Figure 1E).
Profibrillin is translated as a 2,871-amino-acid long proprotein,
which is cleaved at the C terminus by the protease furin (Lo
¨ nnqv-
ist et al., 1998; Milewicz et al., 1995). This generates a 140-
amino-acid long C-terminal cleavage product, in addition to
mature fibrillin-1 (an extracellular matrix component). All seven
NPS mutations are clustered around the cleavage site, resulting
in heterozygous ablation of the C-terminal cleavage product
(asprosin) (Figure 1E), whose fate and function were unknown.
Asprosin, the C-Terminal Cleavage Product of
Profibrillin, Is a Fasting-Responsive Plasma Protein
Asprosin is encoded by the ultimate two exons of FBN1. Exon 65
encodes 11 amino acids, while exon 66 encodes 129 amino
acids. Together, those two exons display a somewhat higher
vertebrate evolutionary conservation score compared with the
rest of the profibrillin coding sequence (Figures S1A and S1B).
We developed an asprosin-specific monoclonal antibody and
validated its specificity for asprosin using Fbn1 wild-type (WT)
and null cells (Figure S1C). Immunoblotting human plasma with
the anti-asprosin antibody shows a single protein running on
SDS-PAGE at �30 kDa, while bacterially expressed recombinant
asprosin runs at �17 kDa (Figure 2A). Asprosin is predicted to
have three N-linked glycosylation sites and potentially other
post-translational modifications that are lacking in bacteria
(Figures S1D and S1E). This likely explains the difference in mo-
lecular weight between mammalian and bacterially expressed
asprosin. Indeed, using mammalian cells for expression of as-
prosin produced a protein that was secreted into the media
and
ran
on
SDS-PAGE
at
the
same
molecular
weight
(�30 kDa) (Lo
¨ nnqvist et al., 1998) as we observed in human
plasma, cell lysates and media from mouse embryonic fibro-
blasts, and cell/tissue lysates from cultured adipocytes and
mouse white adipose tissue (Figures 2A, S1C, S2A, and S2B).
To measure circulating asprosin levels, we developed a sand-
wich ELISA (Figure S3A). We constructed a standard curve using
recombinant asprosin and used it to calculate plasma and media
levels (Figure 2B). As expected, the asprosin sandwich ELISA
displayed high specificity using media from WT and Fbn1�/�
cells (Figure S3C). Asprosin was found to be present in plasma
at consistent nanomolar levels in humans, mice, and rats (Fig-
ure 2C). Interestingly, NPS patients displayed a greater reduction
in circulating asprosin level than predicted from their heterozy-
gous genotype, compared not only with WT control subjects
but also when compared with patients that have heterozygous
truncations of profibrillin sufficiently N-terminal so as to undergo
mRNA nonsense-mediated decay (Figure 2D). This suggests
that the mutant profibrillin that is predicted to be expressed in
NPS cells (due to escape from mRNA NMD) exerts a domi-
nant-negative effect on secretion of asprosin from the WT allele.
We tested this concept by overexpressing the truncated, mutant
version of profibrillin in WT cells and found that this interfered
with the ability of those cells to secrete asprosin into the media,
compared with overexpression of an irrelevant protein, such as
GFP (Figures S3E and S3F).
To assess daily fluctuations in circulating asprosin concentra-
tions, mice were kept in a 12-hr light/12-hr dark cycle for 7 days
to establish entrainment and were subsequently kept in constant
darkness. Plasma was then isolated from these mice at 4-hr in-
tervals and subjected to asprosin ELISA analysis. We found
that plasma asprosin displays circadian oscillation with an acute
drop in levels coinciding with the onset of feeding (Figure 2E). In
the opposite direction, overnight fasting in humans, mice, and
rats resulted in increased circulating asprosin (Figure 2F).
Adipose Tissue Generates and Secretes Asprosin
We examined the FBN1 mRNA profile across all human tissues
using the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTex) RNaseq
dataset and found that adipose tissue demonstrated the highest
FBN1 mRNA expression across all tissues (Figure 2G). To
confirm this in mice, we assessed the Fbn1 expression profile
across various metabolically important organs. Consistent with
the human profile, we found that white adipose tissue displayed
the highest Fbn1 mRNA expression (Figure 2H). Given that white
adipose tissue is a well-known endocrine organ (Trayhurn et al.,
2006), we examined whether it could serve as a source of circu-
lating asprosin. We assessed plasma levels of asprosin in mice
that had been subjected to genetic ablation of adipose tissue.
We used Bscl2�/� mice for this purpose. BSCL2 deficiency re-
sults in Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy in humans
(knockout mice mimic this phenotype) with a 60%–70% reduc-
tion in adipose tissue (Cui et al., 2011). In such mice we detected
a �2-fold reduction in plasma asprosin (Figure 2I). The next
experimental strategy we employed was to assess whether ad-
ipocytes in culture were capable of generating and secreting as-
prosin. For this, we differentiated two distinct adipogenic cell
lines, 3T3-L1 and a mesenchymal stem cell line (C3H10T1/2),
into mature adipocytes (Figures 2J and 2K) and subjected the
cell culture media to asprosin protein analysis. We found robust
accumulation of asprosin in serum-free culture media from
mature adipocytes, but not from preadipocytes (Figures 2J and
2K), suggesting that adipocytes are capable of generating and
secreting asprosin.
A Single Dose of Recombinant Asprosin Elevates Blood
Glucose and Insulin in Mice
We employed ectopic overexpression of full-length FBN1 using
an adenovirus in the hope that the transduced organ (in this
case, the liver, which normally shows low endogenous FBN1
expression [Figures 2G and 2H] and is the primary target of
adenoviral infection) would process the resultant profibrillin
(E) All seven NPS mutations are clustered around the furin cleavage site (RGRKRR motif highlighted in yellow) and are predicted to result in heterozygous ablation
of the 140-amino-acid C-terminal polypeptide (asprosin). Non-native amino acids due to a frameshift are shown in red. Patient #2, case 3, and case 5 have a
mutation in a splice-donor site that has been predicted to produce the indicated mutant protein (Jacquinet et al., 2014).

 and secrete asprosin into the circulation. This strategy showed
robust overexpression of profibrillin protein in the liver and a
2-fold elevation in plasma asprosin (Figures 3A and 3B). The sec-
ond strategy involved daily subcutaneous injection of bacterially
expressed asprosin (validated to result in a 50 nM peak level
20 min after injection; Figure 5D) or recombinant GFP as a con-
trol. 10 days of exposure to increased plasma asprosin in either a
continuous (adenoviral overexpression) or pulsatile fashion (daily
recombinant asprosin injection) resulted in elevated glucose and
insulin levels in 2-hr fasted mice using both experimental strate-
gies (Figures 3C and 3D). This result demonstrated that bacteri-
ally expressed recombinant asprosin retains the biological
activity displayed by its endogenously expressed counterpart
and that elevation of circulating asprosin is sufficient to increase
blood glucose and insulin levels.
In order to understand acute responses, we injected a single
dose of recombinant asprosin subcutaneously in mice that had
been subjected to a preceding 2-hr fast, and measured plasma
glucose at 15, 30, 60, and 120 min post-injection. Mice were
denied access to food through the length of the experiment.
A single asprosin dose resulted in an immediate spike in blood
glucose levels (Figure 3E). This resulted in compensatory hyper-
insulinemia (measured at the 15-min time point) (Figure 3F),
which normalized blood glucose levels by 60 min post-injection
(Figure 3E). Similar results were obtained in mice that were sub-
jected to a preceding overnight fast, although the rate of the
resultant blood glucose spike was somewhat slower, likely due
to fasting-induced depletion of glucogenic substrates (Figures
3G and 3H). These results implicated the liver as the target organ
for asprosin due to its role as the primary site for stored glucose
(as glycogen), which is rapidly released into the circulation
during fasting. Interestingly, asprosin treatment had no effect
on plasma levels of catabolic hormones (glucagon, catechol-
amines, and glucocorticoids), known to induce hepatic glucose
release (Figure 3I).
Asprosin Targets the Liver to Increase Plasma Glucose
in a Cell-Autonomous Manner
Glucose and insulin tolerance tests in mice exposed to a single
dose of recombinant asprosin showed little evidence of altered
glucose uptake (in response to insulin) in peripheral organs,
such as muscle or fat (unchanged slope of glucose disposal),
but showed altered peak glucose levels, again implicating the
liver (Figures 4A and 4B). To confirm the liver as the site of aspro-
sin action, we performed the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic
clamp. This test unequivocally showed that elevated plasma
asprosin results in increased hepatic glucose production (Fig-
ure 4C), but has no impact on the ability of peripheral organs
to take up glucose in response to insulin (Figure 4D). To test
whether the effect of asprosin on the liver is cell autonomous,
we exposed isolated primary mouse hepatocytes to increasing
concentrations of recombinant asprosin or GFP for 2 hr. Media
from cells exposed to asprosin showed an increase in glucose
concentration in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating a
direct effect of asprosin on hepatocytes (Figure 4E).
Asprosin Traffics to the Liver In Vivo and Binds the
Hepatocyte Surface with High Affinity in a Saturable and
Competitive Manner
We labeled recombinant asprosin with iodine-125 (I125) and in-
jected it intravenously in mice, followed by single-photon emis-
sion computerized tomography (SPECT) scans to identify sites
of accumulation. An equivalent amount of free I125 or I125-Aspro-
sin that was boiled for 5 min (to induce loss of the asprosin
tertiary structure) was used as a control. In contrast to the accu-
mulation patterns for free I125 and boiled I125-Asprosin, SPECT
scans in coronal and axial planes (Figure 5A), and mean liver
photon intensity (Figure 5B), both showed that I125-Asprosin traf-
ficked primarily to the liver and that asprosin’s tertiary structure
was essential for its liver recruitment. In accord with liver traf-
ficking, gamma counting of blood and viscera showed that re-
combinant blood asprosin levels decrease in concert with the
increased liver levels (Figure 5C). To measure plasma half-life,
we used a sandwich ELISA system targeting the N-terminal
His-tag on the recombinant asprosin protein at 15, 30, 60, and
120 min following subcutaneous injection. Consistent with our
results using IV infusion of I125-Asprosin, plasma His-tagged
asprosin showed a half-life of approximately 20 min and a
peak level of 50 nM that was achieved 20 min post-injection
(Figure 5D).
To examine specific binding of asprosin by hepatocytes,
we incubated mouse primary hepatocytes with an increasing

 amount of an asprosin-biotin conjugate, washed with PBS, and
measured the relative level of biotin at the hepatocyte surface.
Asprosin bound the hepatocyte surface in a dose-responsive
and saturable manner (Figure 5E). Repeating the same proce-
dure in the presence of 100-fold excess unconjugated asprosin
abolished the effect, suggesting competition for potential recep-
tor binding sites (Figure 5E).

(PKA) activity (Figures 6A–6C). Identical
results were obtained upon incubating
mouse primary hepatocytes with recom-
binant asprosin for 10 min (Figures 6D
and 6E). Hepatocyte PKA activity increased in a dose-respon-
sive manner upon addition of recombinant asprosin (Figure 6F),
similar to what we observed with hepatocyte glucose release
(Figure 4E). The effects of asprosin on both hepatocyte glucose
release and PKA activation were blocked by suramin, a general
heterotrimeric G protein inhibitor (Figures 6G and 6H). In addi-
tion, asprosin-mediated hepatocyte glucose release could be
blocked by using cAMPS-Rp, a competitive antagonist of
cAMP binding to PKA (Figure 6I). These results demonstrate
that asprosin increases hepatocyte glucose release by employ-
ing the G protein-cAMP-PKA axis in vivo and in vitro. Because
glucagon and catecholamines also employ the same intracellular
signaling axis, we tested the impact of inhibiting the glucagon

 receptor or the b-adrenergic receptor on the ability of asprosin to
enhance hepatocyte glucose release. While the respective inhib-
itors completely blocked the effects of glucagon or epinephrine,
they had no impact on the ability of asprosin to influence hepa-
tocyte glucose release (Figures 6J and 6K). This suggests that

asprosin uses a cell-surface receptor
system that is distinct from those used
by glucagon and catecholamines. Since
insulin is known to induce a reduction in
intracellular cAMP (via activation of the
Gai pathway), we tested whether insulin
would
oppose
asprosin’s
effect
on
hepatocyte PKA activation and glucose
release, which is demonstrated to be
due to an increase in intracellular cAMP.
Indeed, we found that insulin suppressed
asprosin-mediated hepatocyte PKA acti-
vation (Figure 6L) and glucose release
(Figure 6M).

Sequestration Is Protective against

We found that plasma asprosin levels are
pathologically elevated in human subjects
with insulin resistance (Figure 7A). Similar
elevations were seen in two independent
mouse models of insulin resistance (diet-induced obesity and
Ob mutation) (Figure 7B). Intraperitoneal injection of a single
dose of an asprosin-specific monoclonal antibody was sufficient
to acutely drop plasma asprosin levels at 3 and 6 hr post-injec-
tion, with recovery to normal levels at 24 hr (Figure 7C). Both

 ad-libitum-fed (following a 2-hr fast for synchronization) models
of mouse insulin resistance showed an acute reduction in
plasma insulin levels (while maintaining euglycemia), concurrent
with plasma asprosin depletion (Figures 7D–7G). To directly test
the effect of loss of asprosin on hepatocyte glucose production
without the potential insulin compensatory effect, we treated
mouse primary hepatocytes with the asprosin-specific antibody
prior to incubating them with asprosin. As expected, the aspro-
sin-specific antibody blocked asprosin-mediated hepatocyte
glucose release, while a non-specific control antibody had no
effect (Figure S3D).
To validate immunologic sequestration as a legitimate loss-of-
function strategy, we tested FBN1 hypomorphic mice (homozy-
gous MgR mice), which express only �20% of the WT FBN1
transcript (Pereira et al., 1999). MgR mice displayed a 70%
decrease in circulating asprosin (Figure 7H). Upon 2 hr of fasting,
MgR mice displayed a 2-fold deficit in plasma insulin, while

His tag (recombinant asprosin contains an N-ter-
minal His tag) in WT mice before injection and 15,
30, 60, and 120 min after injection with 30 mg re-
combinant asprosin. The time taken for peak signal
to fall to half-maximal level is indicated by the arrow.
(E) The level of biotin at the hepatocyte surface was
measured using a colorimetric assay upon incuba-
tion of unplated mouse primary hepatocytes with
increasing concentration of a recombinant aspro-
sin-biotin conjugate, with (non-specific binding) or
without (total binding) 100-fold excess recombinant
asprosin in the media. Specific binding (shown in
red) was calculated as the difference between the
two curves.

maintaining euglycemia (similar to what
we observed with immunologic sequestra-
tion of asprosin in ad-libitum-fed mice)
(Figures 7I and 7J). However, upon 24 hr
of fasting, a physiologic situation that elim-
inates insulin from the circulation of mice
(Figure 7J), MgR mice displayed fasting
hypoglycemia (Figure 7I), suggesting that
insulin’s buffering effect needs to be elim-
inated (via a long fast) to unmask the
reduction in plasma glucose induced by
asprosin loss of function. To confirm this, we performed a hyper-
insulinemic-euglycemic clamp study on MgR mice that had been
fasted for �18 hr (basal). Under such conditions, we found an
acute deficit in hepatic glucose production (HGP) in MgR mice
compared with WT mice (Figure 7K). This result is consistent
with clamp results showing an increase in HGP upon asprosin
gain of function (Figures 4C and 4D). Expectedly, neither clamp
study demonstrated a change in whole-body glucose disposal
(insulin sensitivity) (Figures 4D and 7L), suggesting that aspro-
sin’s effect on glucose homeostasis is limited to serving as a
stimulator of HGP (Figure S4), and any change in plasma insulin
levels is indirect and downstream of the change in HGP.
Finally, a single subcutaneous administration of asprosin in
overnight-fasted MgR mice was sufficient to completely rescue
the insulin deficiency displayed by these mice (Figure 7M). This
result demonstrates that the insulin deficiency displayed by
MgR mice is entirely due to a deficiency in circulating asprosin,

 and not to some indirect effect of their decreased expression of
functional fibrillin protein.
DISCUSSION
Whether circulating asprosin concentration is experimentally
decreased (genetic depletion in NPS patients, genetic depletion
in MgR mice, or acute removal via immunologic sequestration in
mice) or increased (adenovirus-mediated overexpression or
direct recombinant protein injection), the result is a correspond-
ing change in plasma glucose and insulin. With asprosin loss of
function, hypoglycemia is only unmasked upon elimination of a
b-cell-mediated corrective action, by fasting mice long enough
to drive insulin levels close to zero, leaving little room for b cells
to further decrease insulin secretion and normalize plasma
glucose.
It seems surprising that a nutritionally responsive hormone
that displays circadian oscillation (Figure 2E) would be derived
from what would seem a relatively ‘‘static’’ structural/ECM
protein. This led us to examine the profile of the FBN1 transcript
using
a
publicly
available
circadiomics
database
(http://
circadiomics.igb.uci.edu). Interestingly, the Fbn1 transcript dis-
plays robust daily circadian oscillation in several tissues, such
as the heart, adrenal, lung, white fat, and kidney. The notion
that fibrillin-1 is a static, structural molecule may need further ex-
amination. Another pertinent question relates to the primary tis-
sue of origin of asprosin. We demonstrate adipose to be one of
the sources of plasma asprosin. This observation is consistent
with the known function of adipose as an endocrine organ and
a sensor/modulator of energy homeostasis. However, it is worth
noting that organs besides adipose could also serve as sources
of plasma asprosin, given the fairly high expression of FBN1 in
several organs.
Since asprosin functions to increase plasma glucose levels,
and circulating asprosin levels are increased by fasting (a base-
line glucose condition) (Figure 2F) and decreased by feeding
(a high glucose condition) (Figure 2E), we hypothesized that
glucose could serve as a suppressor of plasma asprosin levels
in a negative-feedback loop. To determine this, we subjected
mature adipocytes in culture to high glucose levels and found
that this treatment was sufficient to strongly inhibit the accumu-
lation of asprosin in media, compared with adipocytes subjected
to glucose-free conditions (Figures S5B and S5D). We detected
no decrease in intracellular asprosin protein with glucose addi-
tion (Figure S5E), suggesting that glucose-mediated downregu-
lation of extracellular asprosin levels does not occur at the level
of transcription, biosynthesis, or processing. To confirm this
result in vivo, we subjected WT mice to streptozotocin (STZ)
treatment, which is known to ablate pancreatic b cells, resulting
in high blood glucose. In such mice plasma asprosin was found
to be far lower than in mice with normal blood glucose (Fig-
ure S5F). Together, these in vitro and in vivo results are consis-
tent with the notion that glucose serves as a negative influencer
of plasma asprosin levels in a negative-feedback loop and
is consistent with the regulation of other major hormones (for
example, calcium suppresses parathyroid hormone secretion
and glucose suppresses glucagon secretion) (Campbell and
Drucker, 2015; Dumoulin et al., 1995).
Generally, protein hormones are processed via endoplasmic
reticulum and Golgi pathways and stored in intracellular gran-
ules, followed by secretion in response to appropriate cues.
Consistent with this, we detected processed asprosin intracellu-
larly in cultured fibroblasts, mouse white adipose tissue, and
cultured adipocytes (Figures S1C, S2A, and S2B). Asprosin
has been shown to retain the ability to be secreted from the
cell, despite the lack of a signal peptide. This was demonstrated
by overexpressing just the asprosin coding exons in mammalian
cells, followed by detection of asprosin in the media (Lo
¨ nnqvist
et al., 1998). We repeated this assay by overexpressing aspro-
sin-encoding cDNA in Fbn1�/� cells (to prevent contamination
from endogenous asprosin), and asprosin secretion was de-
tected in the media (Figures S6A and S6B). Furthermore, aspro-
sin secretion could be suppressed by glucose (Figure S6B),
consistent with the phenomenon observed in cultured adipo-
cytes (Figures S5B and S5D). Several extracellular proteins,
such as FGF-1, FGF-2, and IL-1b, lack an N-terminal signal pep-
tide and are secreted using non-classical or leaderless secretion
(Nickel, 2003), as demonstrated by asprosin.
To assess the tissue sources of elevated asprosin with insulin
resistance, we assessed the Fbn1 mRNA profile across various
mouse tissues from WT and Ob/Ob mice. We found strong upre-
gulation of the Fbn1 mRNA in white adipose tissue, brown adi-
pose tissue, and skeletal muscle (Figure S7A), three organs
that are frequently implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin resis-
tance. The upregulation in white adipose tissue was especially
potent, again implicating it as a major tissue source of plasma
asprosin. The mechanism of upregulation of plasma asprosin
via increased Fbn1 mRNA in adipose and skeletal muscle seems
unique to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance because we did
not detect any changes in Fbn1 mRNA in any of the organs with
fasting and streptozotocin treatment (Figures S7B and S7C), two
other manipulations associated with major changes in plasma
asprosin. Type II diabetes remains a major cause of morbidity,
in isolation, and as a part of metabolic syndrome. Inappropri-
ately, elevated glucose production by the insulin-resistant liver
is a major factor underlying its pathogenesis (Magnusson et al.,
1992). It is possible that the elevated asprosin levels we
observed in insulin-resistant humans and mice contribute to
this. The insulin-lowering effects of immunologic sequestration
of asprosin in obese, insulin-resistant mice suggest decreased
asprosin activity as a unique approach to acutely counteract
this pathologic effect. Accordingly, asprosin depletion may
represent an important therapeutic strategy against type II
diabetes.

 Whole-Exome Capture and Sequencing
Genomic DNA from patient #1 and her parents was subjected to whole-exome
sequencing (trio analysis). Variants were annotated, and analysis was per-
formed in the trio to look for potential recessive (homozygous and compound
heterozygous) and de novo variants.
Sanger Sequencing
Genomic DNA from both patients was subjected to Sanger sequencing.
Primers were designed to encompass exons 65 and 66, including intron-
exon boundaries, of the FBN1 gene using Primer3. Sanger reads were
analyzed using the Lasergene Seqman software. For patient #1, Sanger
sequencing was performed on genomic DNA from both parents and unaf-
fected siblings to confirm de novo occurrence and segregation with the
phenotype.
Animals
We used 12-week-old male WT C57Bl/6 mice for in vivo studies. MgR hetero-
zygous mice were obtained from Jackson labs and bred to obtain male MgR
homozygous mice and WT littermates. 5-week-old male Ob/Ob mice were ob-
tained from Jackson labs. Mice were housed 2–5 per cage in a 12-hr light/
12-hr dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. For diet-induced
obesity studies, mice were placed on the adjusted-calories diet providing
60% of calories from fat by Harlan-Teklad for 12 weeks. Mice were exposed
to adenoviral-mediated transgenesis (1011 virus particles per mouse) via tail-
vein injections. Mice were exposed to 30 mg recombinant His-tagged asprosin
or recombinant GFP daily for 10 days via subcutaneous injection. Mice were
sacrificed, and plasma and various organs were isolated 10 days after virus
or peptide injection. For single-dose injections, the same protocol was fol-
lowed as that for daily injections, followed by collection of plasma at the indi-
cated times via tail bleeds for insulin and glucose measurement. Insulin and
glucose tolerance tests (ITT and GTT) were performed using standard proce-
dures. A 0.5 U/kg insulin bolus was used for the ITT, and a 1.5 mg/g glucose
bolus was used for the GTT. For immunologic sequestration experiments,
mice were injected intraperitoneally with a 500-mg dose in saline of a
custom-built (Thermo Scientific) anti-asprosin mouse monoclonal antibody
directed against amino acids 106–134 (human profibrillin amino acids
2838–2865) or an equivalent dose of isotype-matched immunoglobulin G
(IgG) (Southern Biotech). Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies were
performed in unrestrained mice using regular human insulin (Humulin R, doses:
2.5 mU/kg body weight) in combination with high-performance liquid chroma-
tography-purified [3-3H] glucose as described previously (Saha et al., 2010).
The Baylor College of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Utilization Com-
mittee approved all experiments.
Plasma Metabolic Parameters
Human plasma insulin was measured using a human insulin ELISA kit by Ab-
cam. Mouse plasma insulin was measured using a mouse insulin ELISA kit
by Millipore. Mouse plasma glucagon, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and
corticosterone were measured by the Vanderbilt University Hormone Assay
& Analytical Services Core.
Recombinant Asprosin and GFP
Human FBN1 (2732–2871 amino acids) cDNA was cloned and subsequently
sub-cloned into a pET-22B vector for expression in Escherichia coli. The fusion
protein that was expressed in E. coli is 146 amino acids long comprising of a
six-amino-acid His tag on the N terminus and a 140-amino-acid wild-type as-
prosin. His-tagged GFP expressed in E. coli was obtained from Thermo Scien-
tific as the control protein. The His-asprosin and His-GFP were isolated from
E. coli and allowed to bind to Ni-NTA His-Bind column. After extensive washing
of the column in order to remove contaminating proteins, His-asprosin and
His-GFP were eluted from the column using a 150-mM imidazole buffer. The
recombinant proteins were further purified using size-exclusion columns and
polymyxin B-based endotoxin-depletion columns (Detoxi-Gel Endotoxin
Removing Gel by Thermo Scientific) with as many passages as required to
bring the final endotoxin concentration equal to or below 2 EU/ml, and buffer
exchanged into a PBS-glycerol buffer or a 20 mM MOPS (pH 7.0), 300 mM
NaCl, and 150 mM Imidazole buffer. The purified proteins were subjected
to SDS-PAGE analysis in order to determine the purity level. The His-GFP
and His-asprosin proteins used in all recombinant protein experiments
were >90% pure with endotoxin levels (determined using the Pierce LAL
Chromogenic Endotoxin Quantitation Kit) as indicated (Figure S7D) before
and after passage through endotoxin-depletion columns.
Cell Culture
Primary mouse hepatocytes were isolated from 8- to 12-week-old WT mice us-
ing standard methodology. Within a few minutes of isolation, cells were placed
in glucose-free media in Eppendorf tubes and subjected to treatment with re-
combinant 50 nM asprosin, 50 nM recombinant GFP, 5 mM Suramin (Tocris),
200 mM cAMPS-Rp (Tocris), 1 mM L168,049 (Tocris), 100 mM Epinephrine
(Sigma), 10 mg/ml Glucagon (Sigma), 10 mg/l Insulin (Sigma), or 100 mM Pro-
pranolol (Sigma). The cells were treated with 50 nM recombinant asprosin or
GFP for 10 min for cAMP and PKA assays and for 2 hr for the in vitro glucose
production assay. Cells were pretreated with various inhibitors for 1 hr prior to
treatment with asprosin, GFP, glucagon, or epinephrine. cAMP was measured
from cell lysates using the cAMP Direct Immunoassay Kit from Cell Biolabs.
PKA activity was measured from cell lysates using the PKA Kinase Activity
Kit from Enzo Lifesciences. Media glucose content was measured using the
Glucose Colorimetric Assay Kit from Biovision. Results were normalized to
protein content.
Recombinant asprosin was conjugated with biotin using the Basic Bio-
tinylation Sulfo-NHS Kit from Pierce. Primary hepatocytes were incubated
with increasing concentration of the asprosin-biotin conjugate at 4�C, alone,
or in the presence of 100-fold excess unconjugated asprosin for 30 min. The
cells were washed three times with PBS without lysis, followed by addition
(D) Hepatocyte cAMP level was measured 10 min after incubating mouse primary hepatocytes with 50 nM recombinant asprosin, 1 hr following isolation of cells
from WT mice, without plating the cells.
(E) Hepatocyte PKA activity was measured in samples from (D).
(F) Hepatocyte PKA activity was measured upon 2 hr of incubation of mouse primary hepatocytes with 0, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 138, 275, 550, or 1,100 nM recombinant
asprosin or GFP, 1 hr following isolation of cells from WT mice, without plating the cells.
(G) Media glucose accumulation was measured 2 hr after incubating mouse primary hepatocytes with 50 nM recombinant asprosin or GFP, with or without a
G protein inhibitor (Suramin) (5 mM), 1 hr following isolation of cells from WT mice, without plating the cells.
(H) Hepatocyte PKA activity was measured in samples from (G).
(I) Media glucose accumulation was measured 2 hr after incubating mouse primary hepatocytes with 50 nM recombinant asprosin or GFP, with or without a
competitive antagonist of cAMP-induced activation of PKA (cAMPS-Rp) (200 mM), 1 hr following isolation of cells from WT mice, without plating the cells.
(J) Media glucose accumulation was measured 2 hr after incubating mouse primary hepatocytes with 50 nM recombinant asprosin or GFP, or 10 mg/ml glucagon,
with or without a non-competitive antagonist of the glucagon receptor (L168,049) (1 mM) 1 hr following isolation of cells from WT mice, without plating the cells.
(K) The same analysis was performed as in (J) using 100 mM epinephrine, with or without an antagonist of the b-adrenergic receptor (propranolol) (100 mM).
The r GFP and r asprosin controls are common for (J) and (K).
(L) Hepatocyte PKA activity was measured 2 hr after incubating mouse primary hepatocytes with 50 nM recombinant asprosin or GFP, with vehicle or 10 mg/l
insulin, 1 hr following isolation of cells from WT mice, without plating the cells.
(M) Hepatocyte glucose production was measured in samples from (L).

and the results were normalized to protein content.
3T3-L1 and C3H10T1/2 preadipocyte cells were exposed to an adipogenic
cocktail (1 mM insulin, 1 mM dexamethasone, 0.5 mM isobutyl methyl xanthine,
and 3 mM rosiglitazone) for 7 days. Adipogenesis was confirmed by visualiza-
tion of lipid droplets and PPARg2 mRNA expression.
Serum-free DMEM, with or without 4.5 g/l glucose, was used for measuring
glucose-mediated influence on secretion of asprosin.
WT human 140-amino-acid asprosin (profibrillin amino acids 2732–2871)
and mutant profibrillin carrying the c.8206_8207InsA mutation that induces
a frameshift and C-terminal truncation were sub-cloned under the control of
the CMV promoter using the pCMV6-Neo vector system.
Sandwich ELISA and Western Blot
For the endogenous asprosin sandwich ELISA, a custom-built (Thermo Scien-
tific) mouse monoclonal anti-asprosin antibody against asprosin amino acids
106–134 (human profibrillin amino acids 2838–2865) was used as the capture
antibody, and a goat anti-asprosin polyclonal antibody against asprosin amino
acids 6–19 (human profibrillin amino acids 2737–2750) by Abnova was used as
the detection antibody. An anti-goat secondary antibody linked to HRP was
used to generate a signal. For the His-tag sandwich ELISA, the same proce-
dure was used, except for the use of a goat anti-His polyclonal antibody
(Abcam) as the detection antibody. Increasing amounts of recombinant aspro-
sin (which contains an N-terminal His tag) were used to generate a standard
curve for both assays. EDTA plasma was used for plasma sandwich ELISAs,
and serum-free DMEM concentrated using Vivaspin protein concentrator
spin columns by GE Life Sciences was used for media sandwich ELISAs.
Plasma western blotting for asprosin was done using a custom-built
(Thermo Scientific) mouse monoclonal anti-asprosin antibody against aspro-
sin amino acids 106–134 (human profibrillin amino acids 2838–2865). Plasma
was depleted of immunoglobulins and albumin using an Albumin/IgG Removal
Kit by Pierce.
Western blotting for profibrillin was done using the mouse monoclonal anti-
fibrillin-1 antibody against profibrillin amino acids 451–909 by Abcam.
Western blotting for phospho-PKA and total PKA was carried out using
antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.
