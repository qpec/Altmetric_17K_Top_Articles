Summary
Human studies on the effects of probiotics on lowering blood cholesterol levels have not yielded conclusive results. 
A meta‑analysis of randomized controlled trials evaluating the effect of probiotics on lipid profile was conducted. 
Articles were reviewed systematically from web search bases; PubMed, Cochrane Clinical Trial Registry. Those 
studies which were meeting the inclusion criteria-providing matching placebo, at least single blind for probiotics and 
placebo, providing mean and standard deviations and not involving the use of probiotics were selected. 14 studies 
from 12 randomized controlled trials were analyzed providing information of 606 normo/hypercholesterolemic 
patients using Review Manager 5.3 (The Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK). The pooled mean net change for total 
cholesterol (TC) is −8.40 mg/dl (−13.63, −3.61), for low‑density lipoprotein (LDL) is −6.63 mg/dl (−10.63, −2.63), for 
high‑density‑lipoprotein‑cholesterol is 0.59 mg/dl (−0.92, 2.09), and for triglycerides is −1.32 mg/dl (−6.49, 3.85). The 
findings of the analysis conclude that probiotics supplementation does lower serum TC and LDL‑cholesterol levels 
significantly and hence a reduction in the risk factor of developing coronary heart disease.

Introduction
It is well known higher levels of serum cholesterol are 
generally considered to be a risk factor for coronary heart 
disease (CHD).1 Results from several epidemiological 
and clinical studies indicate a positive correlation 
between elevated total serum cholesterol levels, mainly 
reflecting the low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol 
fraction and risk of emergence of CHD.2 The WHO 
has predicted that by 2030, CHD or diseases of heart 
will remain the leading cause of death, affecting 
approximately 23.6 million people worldwide. South

Asians around the globe have the highest rates of 
coronary artery disease.3
Currently, there is extensive interest in the dietary 
management of serum cholesterol and triglyceride (TG) 
levels. This is largely driven by the large numbers of 
individuals affected, the expense of drug therapy; statins, 
fibrates, niacin, cholesterol absorption inhibitors, and 
bile acid sequestrants, and unwanted side effects of such 
treatments which have concerned long-term use. For this 
reason, a number of nonpharmacological approaches 
such as lifestyle modification, inclusion of potential 
cholesterol-lowering products such as plant stanols, soy, 
cinnamon, and also probiotic strains resulting in serum 
cholesterol reduction are continuously being developed 
and tested.4 Probiotics are defined as “living microbial 
supplements that beneficially affect the host animals by

improving its intestinal microbial balances” or as live 
microorganisms that when administered in adequate 
amounts, confer a health benefit on the host.5
The virtues of probiotics are already well recognized for 
general gut health and immunity; various studies have 
indicated that probiotics may alleviate lactose intolerance, 
have a positive influence on the intestinal flora of the 
host,6 reduce inflammatory or allergic reactions,7 possess 
anti-colon cancer effects,8 antihypertensive effects,9 
and reduce clinical manifestations of atopic dermatitis, 
Crohn’s disease, diarrhea, constipation, candidiasis, and 
urinary tract infections.10-12 More recently, probiotics 
have also been studied for their cholesterol-lowering 
effects.13-15 A number of animal studies using a variety of 
strains have demonstrated this effect.16-21 Human studies, 
on the other hand, have yielded inconsistent results with 
some showing positive significant effects while others 
with no effects.22-26 With more such conflicting results, 
it was considered worthwhile to conduct a meta-analysis 
of randomized controlled trials evaluating the effect of 
probiotics on serum lipid levels.
Materials and Methods
PubMed was searched through for randomized controlled 
trials for evaluating the effect of probiotics on lipid 
profile using keywords - (cholesterol OR lipid profile 
OR HDL-cholesterol OR LDL-cholesterol OR TGs) 
AND (probiotics OR fermented milk products). Those 
studies were selected which met inclusion criteria: (1) 
randomized controlled trials which were at least 
single blinded for participants, both probiotics and 
placebo; (2) study designs which used a matched 
control group, i.e., the use of yogurt against yogurt 
and capsules against capsule; (3) studies which 
provided values of mean and standard deviation for 
total cholesterol (TC), LDL-cholesterol, high-density 
lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and TG levels for both 
intervention and control groups; (4) use of prebiotics/
plant stanols/nutrient apart from probiotics; and (5) 
publications in English language.
Data abstraction was performed by the author (Smriti 
Sharma). As presented in Table 1, information related to 
articles such as first authors’ name, year of publication, 
probiotics type used placebo type, sample size, study 
design, study duration, dosage, inclusion criteria, 
age, sex, sample size, baseline values of serum TC; 
LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and TGs levels 
separately for intervention and control arm were 
abstracted from the articles reviewed. We assessed 
the methodological quality of the included clinical 
trials using the modified Jadad scale. The modified 
Jadad scale scores range from 1 (very low) to 5 (very 
high). The 5-point quality scale assigns points for 
randomization (described as randomized, 1 point; 
described appropriate randomization method, additional 
point), double blinding (described as double blind, 1 
point; described appropriate blinding method, additional 
point), and follow-up (stated the number and reasons for 
withdrawal in each group, 1 point) in the report of each 
trial. All trials were classified into two groups based on 
scores of <3 as low-quality or ≥3 as high-quality studies.27
Statistical analysis
For the meta-analysis, changes in mean and standard 
deviation of lipid parameters (TC, LDL-cholesterol, 
HDL-cholesterol, and TGs) were of interest. The values 
were therefore appropriately modified from mmol/L to mg/
dl, and standard errors were converted to standard deviation. 
The conversion factor used was 1 mg/dl = 0.0259 mmol/L 
for TC, LDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol and 1 mg/
dl = 0.0113 mmol/L for TG values wherever applicable.27
As most articles provide the mean and standard deviations 
at baseline and endpoint, the net change was calculated. 
For parallel trials, mean net changes for the outcomes listed 
above were calculated as the difference (probiotic diet minus 
control diet) of the changes (baseline minus endpoint) in 
mean values. For crossover trials, mean net changes for the 
outcomes were calculated as the difference (probiotic diet 
minus control diet) in values at the end of the intervention 
and control phases. For computing the change in standard 
deviations for one taken at baseline and at the end of 
treatment, the variance of the difference expressed as:
Var (∆) =2 σ2 (1 − r).
was used where r is the observed tracking correlation 
between cholesterol measures at baseline and follow-up.28,29 
The analysis was conducted using Review Manager 5.3 (The 
Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK). Heterogeneity 
between studies was assessed using the Chi-square test 
and I2 statistic with values ranging from 0% to 100%. 
Statistical significance for the test of heterogeneity was 
set at 0.05. If significant heterogeneity existed, it would 
have been inappropriate to combine the data for further 
analysis using a fixed-effects model. In such cases, the 
random-effect model was used for calculation.

To explore the influence of low-quality studies, subgroup 
analysis was performed. The subgroup was selected 
based on their Jadad score (<3).
Results
Description of studies
In this meta-analysis, overall 12 articles were selected 
meeting our criteria.14, 23, 25-26, 30-37 Of these, study conducted 
by Agerholm-Larsen et al.14 considered three types of 
yogurts manufactured using three different probiotic 
strains and compared to the control and was considered 
as three different trials compared with one same control 
while performing the analysis.14 Hence, 14 studies from 
12 randomized controlled trials were included in this 
meta-analysis. Characteristics of the studies selected are 
summarized in Table 1; includes 2 crossover and 12 parallel 
trials using various probiotics strains of Lactobacillus, 
Bifidobacterium, and Enterococcus general, a pooled 
total of 606 subjects participated in the trials, age ranging 
from 18 to 65 years and study duration varying from 4 to 
12 weeks.14, 23, 25-26, 30-37 A staggering 67.32% were women 
participants, pooled of all the trials included. Subject’s 
baseline mean serum TC values varied from 162.5 mg/dl 
to 264 mg/dl and mean LDL-cholesterol levels varied from 
96.5 mg/dl to 172 mg/dl. Mean baseline HDL-cholesterol 
levels ranged from 39 mg/dl to 76 mg/dl and mean baseline 
of TG levels ranged from 57.5 mg/dl to 250 mg/dl. None 
of the subjects were on cholesterol-lowering drugs.
All studies were at least single-blinded, randomized 
controlled trials; people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus 
was the main inclusion criteria in the trial conducted by 
Ejtahed et al.23 and pregnant women of the third trimester 
in trial conducted by Asemi et al.25 Two trials selected 
in the meta-analysis used capsule26,34 as a carrier for 
probiotics strains and placebo.
Outcomes of the meta‑analysis
Quality assessment
To assess the methodological quality, Jadad scale was 
used. Using the scale, 58.33% of the studies had a score 
of 3 or higher and were considered high-quality studies. 
Most studies were reported as randomized and double 
blind, but did not describe the appropriate methods for 
the same, reasons for low score and attributing to low 
quality studies. Its impact overall was however addressed 
in subgroup analysis on the basis of Jadad score (<3 
or ≥3) for any significant difference.
Effect of probiotics on lipid profiles
The pooled mean net change for the effects of probiotics on 
serum TC was found to be − 8.40 mg/dl (95% confidence 
interval [CI]: −13.63 –−3.16) with P = 0.002 and I2 
value of 60% on random effects as shown in Figure 1. 
This shows that probiotic interventions significantly 
decreased serum TC levels. For LDL-cholesterol levels, 
the pooled mean net change by the effect of probiotics 
is − 6.63 mg/dl (95% CI: −10.63–−2.63) on random 
effects with P = 0.01 and I2 value of 51% [Figure 2]. 
Probiotic interventions thereby also showed a significant 
decrease in LDL-cholesterol levels.
For HDL-cholesterol levels, the pooled mean net change 
by the effect of probiotics was 0.59 mg/dl (95% CI: 
−0.92–2.09) on fixed effects model with P = 0.84 and 
I2 value of 0%. For TG-cholesterol levels, the pooled 
mean net change by the effect of probiotics − 1.32 mg/
dl (95% CI: −6.49–3.85) on fixed effects model with

Indian Journal of Public Health, Volume 60, Issue 4, October-December, 2016
P = 0.51 and I2 value of 0%. No statistical significance 
was observed on the effects of probiotics interventions 
on HDL-cholesterol and TG levels.
Subgroup analysis
In subgroup analysis, the influence of low-quality studies 
categorized on the basis of Jadad score on the changes in 
serum TC and LDL-cholesterol was studied. The effect of 
probiotics was found to be significant in lowering serum 
TC levels by excluding studies having a Jadad score <3 
with mean difference of −8.97 (95% CI: −14.89–−3.05; 
P < 0.003). However, the overall effect on TC is comparable 
to the effect obtained when the analysis was restricted to the 
good quality studies (−8.40 mg/dl [95% CI: −13.63–−3.16]).
The effect of probiotics was found to be significant 
in lowering LDL-cholesterol levels by excluding the 
studies having a Jadad score of <3 with mean difference 
of −7.46 (95% CI: −12.14–−2.79; P < 0.002). The 
overall effect on LDL-cholesterol was also found to be 
comparable to the effect obtained when the analysis was 
restricted to the good quality studies.
Publication bias
Funnel plots obtained were interpreted visually by the 
method described by Sterne et al.38 Visual analysis of 
the funnel plots obtained for effect on TC and effect 
on LDL-cholesterol levels does not show evidence for 
publication bias.
Discussion
The present meta-analysis of 14 randomized clinical trials, 
with normo-, borderline-, and borderline high-baseline 
cholesterol levels there was a significant decrease in 
the serum TC (−8.40 mg/dl) and LDL-cholesterol 
levels (−6.63 mg/dl) with the consumption of probiotics 
as compared to control. A trend toward reduction was 
observed for both serum TC and LDL-cholesterol 
levels in 13 out of 14 trials while only six trials showed 
statistically significant decrease in serum TC levels and 
four trials in LDL-cholesterol levels respectively with 
the use of probiotics. However, the use of probiotics 
does not seem to change levels of HDL-cholesterol and 
TG levels significantly. Results of present meta-analysis 
are similar to the ones previously conducted.39-42 A 
meta-analysis conducted by Shimizu et al. including 11 
studies and 26 trials also showed significant reductions in 
TC and LDL-cholesterol levels. However, our inclusion 
criteria were limited to the use of probiotics only and not 
synbiotics to observe and concentrate effect of probiotics 
in lowering cholesterol levels.
While selecting studies, it was observed that some either 
used capsule or yogurt as probiotics carrier along with 
a matching placebo. This added significant calories in 
the latter while keeping their diets usual as a criterion 
in most of them. Hence, this difference in data could 
have influenced the results while comparing to other 
systematic reviews and under-estimated the effect of 
probiotics on blood lipids.
The probiotic strains analyzed in this meta-analysis 
were Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, 
Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, 
Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium lactis, 
Bifidobacterium animalis, and Enterococcus faecium. 
The cholesterol-lowering effect of probiotics, however,

should be noted that varies from strain to strain. The use 
of probiotics evaluated as cholesterol-lowering adjunct has 
its share of limitations. First, all the studies conducted have 
used dosages and amounts too high to be used on the regular 
daily basis, the use of small daily amounts of yogurt over a 
long period needs to be tested and verified. Hence, a long 
follow-up with feasible amounts is the thrust area and must 
be examined using proven strains on human subjects in 
future studies. Second, probiotic food additive used need to 
ensure that they reach the colon alive and in recommended 
viable numbers (1 × 107 cfu/g).43 The viability, however, is 
subjective to the handling of the product (cold temperatures 
required) and hence the effects could be varied. Third, 
the mechanism suggested so far few being probiotics 
assimilate cholesterol in the growing cells, production of 
bile salt hydrolase enzyme and the incorporation in the 
cellular membrane to inhibit the formation of cholesterol 
micelles by the probiotics bacteria’s will bring about 
a small effect compared to the cholesterol-lowering 
drugs.44,45 Hence, cholesterol-lowering drugs such as 
statins are much a preferred choice over other lifestyle 
initiatives by therapists. Moreover, not all patients respond 
equally well to the intervention treatment and hence should 
be kept on drugs along with lifestyle modifications.
However, many patients prefer nondrug treatments 
being wary of the side effects of cholesterol-lowering 
drugs, hence the preference for natural alternatives and 
self-motivation to avert the levels the natural way are 
also on the rise. In the end, this meta-analysis concludes 
with above considerations in mind that probiotics do 
lower serum cholesterol levels significantly and hence a 
reduction in the risk factor of developing CHD.
