BACKGROUND: The biological functions of high-density lipoproteins 
(HDLs) contribute to explaining the cardioprotective role of the lipoprotein 
beyond quantitative HDL cholesterol levels. A few small-scale interventions 
with a single antioxidant have improved some HDL functions. However, 
to date, no long-term, large-scale, randomized controlled trial has been 
conducted to assess the effects of an antioxidant-rich dietary pattern (such 
as a traditional Mediterranean diet [TMD]) on HDL function in humans.
METHODS: This study was performed in a random subsample of 
volunteers from the PREDIMED Study (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea; 
n=296) after a 1-year intervention. We compared the effects of 2 TMDs, 
one enriched with virgin olive oil (TMD-VOO; n=100) and the other enriched 
with nuts (TMD-Nuts; n=100), with respect to a low-fat control diet (n=96). 
We assessed the effects of both TMDs on the role of HDL particles on 
reverse cholesterol transport (cholesterol efflux capacity, HDL ability to 
esterify cholesterol, and cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity), HDL 
antioxidant properties (paraoxonase-1 arylesterase activity and total HDL 
antioxidant capacity on low-density lipoproteins), and HDL vasodilatory 
capacity (HDL ability to induce the release of nitric oxide in endothelial 
cells). We also studied the effects of a TMD on several HDL quality-related 
characteristics (HDL particle oxidation, resistance against oxidative 
modification, main lipid and protein composition, and size distribution).
RESULTS: Both TMDs increased cholesterol efflux capacity relative to 
baseline (P=0.018 and P=0.013 for TMD-VOO and TMD-Nuts, respectively). 
The TMD-VOO intervention decreased cholesteryl ester transfer protein 
activity (relative to baseline, P=0.028) and increased HDL ability to esterify 
cholesterol, paraoxonase-1 arylesterase activity, and HDL vasodilatory 
capacity (relative to control, P=0.039, P=0.012, and P=0.026, 
respectively). Adherence to a TMD induced these beneficial changes by 
improving HDL oxidative status and composition. The 3 diets increased the 
percentage of large HDL particles (relative to baseline, P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The TMD, especially when enriched with virgin olive oil, 
improved HDL atheroprotective functions in humans.

A 
growing and consistent body of evidence (from ob-
servational and randomized controlled trials) sup-
ports that the traditional Mediterranean diet (TMD) 
protects against the development of cardiovascular 
diseases.1 The PREDIMED Study (Prevención con Dieta 
Mediterránea), a multicenter, parallel, randomized con-
trolled trial, has been crucial for showing this protection 
in primary cardiovascular disease prevention.2,3 Several 
mechanisms may contribute to explain the protection of 
this traditional food pattern against atherosclerosis such 
as its ability to preserve DNA and systemic lipids against 
oxidative modifications, its anti-inflammatory effects, its 
modulatory capacity on the metabolomic profile, and its 
capacity to modulate gene expression related to cardio-
vascular diseases.4–7 The TMD has also improved the 
lipid profile related to high-density lipoproteins (HDLs).8,9 
However, it is becoming increasingly more accepted that 
HDL function may reflect the antiatherogenic role of the 
lipoprotein better than HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels.10 
Several foods and nutrients present in the TMD have 
been shown to improve a number of HDL functions in 
humans in previous trials.11–14 To date, however, no evi-
dence of the effects of the whole TMD on HDL properties 
has been reported.
The aim of the present study was to determine, in a 
random subsample of the PREDIMED Study, whether the 
long-term consumption of a TMD, enriched with virgin 
olive oil or nuts, was able to improve the different HDL 
functional properties in humans.
METHODS
An extended description of methods is available in the online-
only Data Supplement.
Study Population
Considering the available samples of the PREDIMED Study2,15 
and the sample size calculation estimated before the experi-
ments, we performed a random selection of individuals with 
biological samples at baseline and after 1 year of dietary 
intervention (n=296, 4.14% of the volunteers of the total trial). 
Volunteers had been randomly assigned in the beginning of 
the study to 1 of the following 3 interventions: a TMD enriched 
with virgin olive oil (TMD-VOO; n=100), a TMD enriched with 
nuts (TMD-Nuts; n=100), and a low-fat control diet (n=96). We 
also registered the changes in general clinical and sociode-
mographic variables, adherence to the TMD, a food frequency 
questionnaire from the previous year, and physical activity.15 
The local Research and Ethics Committee approved the pro-
tocol of the study. Volunteers gave informed consent before 
joining the trial.
HDL Functions and Quality-Related Properties
We determined the volunteers’ biochemical profile (glucose, 
triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-C, apolipoprotein A-I 
[ApoA-I], and apolipoprotein B) in an ABX-Pentra 400 auto-
analyzer (Horiba ABX).11 We calculated low-density lipoprotein 
(LDL) cholesterol levels with the Friedewald formula (when 
triglycerides were <300 mg/dL)16 and the HDL-C/ApoA-I and 
apolipoprotein B/ApoA-I ratios. We isolated HDL particles from 
the plasma of the participants by density gradient ultracentri-
fugation11 or by polyethylene glycol precipitation of apolipo-
protein B–containing lipoproteins.17 We measured cholesterol 
efflux capacity in a model of human THP-1 monocyte-derived 
macrophages.11 We calculated the capacity of HDL particles to 
esterify cholesterol (the HDL-C esterification index) as follows: 
percentage of esterified cholesterol in HDL divided by mass of 
lecithin-cholesterol transfer protein (LCAT; measured in plasma 
as previously reported18). We assessed the activity of choles-
teryl ester transfer protein (CETP) in plasma and the arylester-
ase activity of paraoxonase-1 (PON1) in serum in commercial 
kits.11,18 We measured HDL antioxidant capacity as the ability 
of HDL to decrease the formation of conjugated dienes in LDLs 
in a pro-oxidant environment16 in a random subselection of 90 
volunteers. HDL inflammatory index (HII) was based on the 
oxidation of the fluorescent 2’,7’-dichlorodihydrofluorescein.19 
We determined HDL vasodilatory capacity as the HDL-induced 
increase in nitric oxide production in human umbilical vein 
endothelial cells.20 The level of oxidative modifications in HDL 
particles (the HDL oxidation index) was measured as follows: 
equivalents of malondialdehyde in HDL21 divided by cholesterol 
in HDL. We assessed the resistance of HDL lipoprotein against 
oxidation (HDL oxidation lag time in a pro-oxidant environment) 
in a random subsample of 90 volunteers.16 We assessed HDL 
composition (total cholesterol, free cholesterol, esterified cho-
lesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids, ApoA-I, and apolipopro-
teins A-II and C-III) in isolated HDL samples in an ABX-Pentra 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• The biological functions of high-density lipoproteins 
(HDLs) contribute to explaining the cardioprotec-
tive role of the lipoprotein beyond HDL cholesterol 
levels.
• HDL functions improved after some small-scale 
interventions with antioxidants.
• In this trial, an antioxidant-rich dietary pattern, a 
traditional Mediterranean Diet (especially when 
enriched with virgin olive oil), enhanced the key HDL 
functions (reverse cholesterol transport pathway, 
HDL antioxidant properties, and vasoprotective 
effects) in humans.
• To date, this randomized controlled trial is the larg-
est (n=296) and longest-duration (1 year) study 
assessing change in HDL functionality in humans.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Adherence to a traditional Mediterranean diet, par-
ticularly when enriched with virgin olive oil, improves 
HDL function in humans.
• The present work could contribute to the discovery 
of novel therapeutic targets that may improve HDL 
function in humans (new antioxidant-rich functional 
foods, nutraceuticals, or new drug families).

400 autoanalyzer (Horiba ABX).11 From these data, we calcu-
lated the amount of each apolipoprotein per 1 mg cholesterol 
and the following ratios: HDL triglycerides/HDL esterified cho-
lesterol (triglycerides in HDL core) and HDL phospholipids/HDL 
free cholesterol (phospholipids in HDL surface).11,18 Last, we 
determined HDL size distribution by the LipoPrint technology 
(Quantimetrix).11
Sample Size
Main Sample
A sample size of 96 participants per group allowed ≥80% 
power to detect a significant difference of 0.025 points in nor-
malized cholesterol efflux capacity values between preinterven-
tion and postintervention values and of 0.035 points among 
the 3 interventions, considering a 2-sided type I error of 0.05, 
a loss rate of 5%, and the standard deviation of the differences 
in cholesterol efflux capacity (SD=0.084) after an analogous 
dietary intervention.11
Subgroup for HDL Antioxidant Capacity and HDL 
Resistance Against Oxidation 
Because we had no previous data available on these proper-
ties, we calculated this sample size considering the variability 
of the differences in the activity of the main HDL antioxidant 
enzyme (PON1) after an analogous dietary intervention.22 A 
sample size of 28 participants per group allowed ≥80% power 
to detect a significant difference of 0.057 points in the previ-
ous normalized capacity between preintervention and postint-
ervention values and of 0.08 points among the 3 interventions, 
considering a 2-sided type I error of 0.05, a loss rate of 5%, 
and the standard deviation of the differences in this property 
(SD=0.104).22
Statistical Analyses
We checked the distribution of continuous variables in normal-
ity plots and by the Shapiro-Wilk test and log-transformed the 
nonnormally distributed variables. We looked for differences 
between our subsample and the whole PREDIMED population 
by a t test and for differences in the baseline values among the 
3 intervention groups by a χ2 test (categorical variables) or a 
1-way ANOVA (continuous variables).
We analyzed differences between preintervention and pos-
tintervention values in every intervention by a paired t test. We 
checked the effects of the 3 interventions on the changes in 
the variables of interest in a multivariate linear regression anal-
ysis (using 2 dummy variables, 1 for each intervention group), 
in which we included as covariables sex, age, participant’s 
center of origin (k−1 dummy variables), baseline value of the 
variable, and changes in the presence of dyslipidemia, type 2 
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and smoking habit throughout 
the study.
To assess the relationships among HDL functional param-
eters in baseline values, we performed Spearman correlation 
analyses among variables and a principal component analysis. 
Moreover, to study the relationships among the changes in 
HDL functional parameters after the TMD-VOO intervention (the 
one in which most of the changes in HDL functions took place), 
we performed Spearman correlation analyses among these 
differences, a principal component analysis, and multivariate 
linear regression analyses adjusted for the changes in other 
HDL functions (together with the variables described in the pre-
vious paragraph).
Any 2-sided value of P<0.05 was considered significant. 
We did not correct P values for multiple comparisons because 
our analyses were hypothesis driven and the phenotypes of 
interest were highly correlated and nonindependent. Analyses 
were performed with R software version 3.0.2.23
RESULTS
Participants
Study design is available in Figure I in the online-only 
Data Supplement. We found no significant differences 
among groups in the baseline characteristics of the 
volunteers (Table). Comparison of the baseline charac-
teristics between our subsample and the whole popula-
tion of the PREDIMED trial (Table I in the online-only Data 
Supplement) shows that our volunteers were on aver-
age 1.1 years older and there were 6.8% more men. 
However, no other differences in the main clinical char-
acteristics were observed. Energy expenditure in leisure-
time physical activity and caloric intake did not change 
throughout the study, and volunteers’ compliance with 
the interventions was correct according to biomarkers 
of compliance, TMD adherence scores, and the 1-year 
food frequency questionnaire (Tables II and III in the on-
line-only Data Supplement). Increased adherence to TMD 
after the TMD-VOO intervention was due to increases in 
the consumption of virgin olive oil, legumes, and fish; 
substitution of red/processed meat for white meat; and 
decreases in the consumption of precooked foods and 
industrial sweets (P<0.05). Increased adherence to TMD 
after the TMD-Nuts intervention was due to increases in 
the consumption of nuts, virgin olive oil (less than in the 
TMD-VOO intervention), fruits, vegetables, and oily fish 
and decreases in the consumption of red and processed 
meat, precooked meals, and industrial sweets (P<0.05). 
Last, adherence to a low-fat diet was observed as a 
decrease in total fat intake (particularly saturated fats) 
resulting from decreases in the consumption of high-fat 
dairy products, red and processed meat, precooked 
meals, and industrial sweets (P<0.05).
Lipids
In terms of the biochemical profile of the participants 
(Tables IV and V in the online-only Data Supplement), we 
observed an expected decline in total cholesterol levels 
after the low-fat control diet (P=0.039 and P=0.007 rela-
tive to baseline and the TMD-VOO intervention, respec-
tively). This was due mainly to a decrease in LDL choles-
terol levels (P=0.019 and P=0.004 relative to baseline 
and the TMD-VOO intervention, respectively).
In terms of the HDL-related biochemical profile, we 
did not observe significant changes in HDL-C or ApoA-I

levels in any intervention relative to baseline or the low-
fat diet (Figure 1A–1D). However, there was a significant 
decrease in the HDL-C/ApoA-I ratio values in plasma in 
the TMD interventions relative to baseline (P=0.031 and 
P<0.001 in the TMD-VOO and TMD-Nuts intervention, re-
spectively) but not relative to the low-fat diet.
Cholesterol Efflux Capacity
The cholesterol efflux capacity of the volunteers increased 
with both TMD interventions relative to baseline (P=0.018 
and P=0.013 for TMD-VOO and TMD-Nuts, respectively; 
Figure 1E and 1F) but not relative to the low-fat diet.
HDL Role in Other Steps of Reverse Cholesterol 
Transport
The ability of HDL particles to esterify cholesterol (the 
HDL-C esterification index) increased significantly after 
the TMD-VOO intervention relative to baseline (P=0.007) 
and compared with the low-fat control intervention 
(P=0.039; Figure 1G and 1H).
CETP activity (Figure 1I and 1J) decreased signifi-
cantly after the TMD-VOO intervention relative to baseline 
(P=0.008) but not compared with the low-fat diet.
HDL Antioxidant Capacities
PON1 arylesterase activity did not change significantly 
relative to baseline after any intervention. However, com-
pared with the low-fat diet, it increased after the TMD-
VOO intervention (P=0.012; Figure 2A and 2B).
The HDL capacity to directly counteract LDL oxidation 
rose after the TMD-VOO intervention relative to baseline 
values (P=0.004) but not compared with the low-fat diet 
(Figure 2C and 2D).
With respect to other antioxidant/anti-inflammatory 
properties of HDL, the HII increased significantly after 
the low-fat control diet relative to baseline (P=0.025), 
whereas it did not rise after the TMD interventions (Fig-
ure 2E and 2F). This led to a borderline significant de-
crease in HII values after the TMD-Nuts intervention rela-
tive to the low-fat diet (P=0.060).
HDL Vasodilatory Capacity
The ability of HDL to promote the production of nitric 
oxide in endothelial cells (HDL vasodilatory capacity) 
did not change significantly relative to baseline after 
any intervention. However, it increased significantly af-
ter the TMD-VOO intervention relative to the low-fat diet 
(P=0.026; Figure 3A and 3B).

HDL Oxidation
The level of oxidation of HDL particles (HDL oxidation 
index) decreased after the TMD-VOO and the low-fat con-
trol diet relative to their baseline values (P=0.028 and 
P=0.011, respectively; Figure 4A and 4B).
HDL dynamic resistance against oxidation (HDL oxida-
tion lag time) increased after the TMD-VOO intervention 
relative to baseline values (P=0.006) but not compared 
with the low-fat diet (Figure 4C and 4D).
HDL Composition
Compared with the low-fat diet, the content of triglyc-
erides in HDL core decreased significantly after both 
the TMD-VOO and TMD-Nuts interventions (P=0.027 and 
P=0.035, respectively; Figure 4E and 4F).

After the TMD-VOO intervention, the content of phos-
pholipids in the HDL surface increased relative to base-
line (P=0.003) and the low-fat control diet (P=0.036) 
(Figure 4G and 4H).
We found no significant changes in the levels of ApoA-
I and apolipoproteins A-II and C-III in HDL in any of the 
interventions.
HDL Size Distribution
The 3 interventions increased the levels of large HDL 
particles relative to their baseline values (P<0.001 for 
the 3 interventions; Figure 4I and 4J). We observed no 
differences among the 3 interventions in the multivariate 
regression model.

DISCUSSION
Our results show that 1 year of intervention with a TMD 
improves several HDL functions (cholesterol efflux capac-
ity, cholesterol metabolism, antioxidant/anti-inflammato-
ry properties, and vasodilatory capacity) in individuals at 
high cardiovascular risk. Thus far, this randomized con-
trolled trial is the largest (n=296) and longest-duration 
(1.13±0.21 years [mean±SD]) study assessing change 
in HDL functionality in humans.
Cholesterol efflux capacity is a key biological function 
of HDL: HDL particles extract excess cholesterol from 
peripheral cells for delivery to the liver for metaboliza-
tion or excretion.24 Macrophage-specific cholesterol ef-
flux capacity is inversely related to higher cardiovascular 
risk17 and greater incidence of coronary events.25 In the 
present trial, both TMD interventions increased choles-
terol efflux capacity relative to baseline. We assessed 
cholesterol efflux capacity in a human THP-1 macro-
phage-based model because these cells do not require 
a chemical induction of the expression of the cholesterol 
transporters before the experiments26 and reflect more 
physiologically the efflux phenomenon and the overall hu-
man atherosclerotic process.24 An improved HDL oxida-
tive status27 (as has been associated in our data), lipid 
composition,12 and HDL-related gene expression28 may 
contribute to explaining these changes. Similar incre-
ments in cholesterol efflux capacity using the same hu-
man macrophage model have been observed in clinical 
trials with virgin olive oil11 and trials with supplements of 
polyunsaturated fatty acids.14
HDL lipoproteins esterify and internalize accepted 
cholesterol from the periphery, continuing the reverse 
cholesterol transport pathway.29 This property can be 
measured by LCAT activity29 or the HDL-C esterification 
index. In our study, the TMD-VOO intervention signifi-
cantly increased the HDL-C esterification index. Because 
LCAT is very sensitive to oxidative attacks,30 dietary anti-
oxidants in the TMD may contribute to maintaining LCAT 
nonoxidized and functional. A fruit and vegetable–rich 
diet31 and a supplement of the antioxidant lycopene13 
have induced similar effects in previous studies.
CETP is a key enzyme in the cholesterol transfer 
from HDL particles to triglyceride-poor lipoproteins (and 
subsequently to the liver). CETP activity is frequently in-
creased in high-cardiovascular-risk states.32 However, 
inhibition of CETP with pharmacological agents has not 
resulted in improved cardiovascular outcomes.33 It has 
been hypothesized that this lack of effects could be due 
to the futility of drastically increasing HDL-C levels above 
physiological concentrations or to harmful off-target ef-
fects (eg, hypertensive ones).33 Nevertheless, a slight 
decrease in the CETP activity (such as that present after 
the TMD-VOO intervention in this trial [2.90%] or after a 
lycopene-rich diet13 [5.87%]), accompanied by a general 
improvement in the lipid metabolism profile and without 
off-target effects, may be protective because it could 
contribute to maintaining HDL homeostatic function.
Another key atheroprotective role of HDL is its antioxi-
dant capacity. HDL lipoproteins are able to counteract 
the oxidation of LDL, one of the main biochemical trig-
gers of the development of the atherosclerotic plaque.10 
This antioxidant capacity is coordinated through the ac-
tion of several proteins, among which PON1 is the cen-
tral enzyme.34 Although low PON1 arylesterase activity 
has been postulated as a potential predictor of cardiac 
events in some trials,35 its predictive role is still contro-
versial in other human studies.36 In the present trial, the 
TMD-VOO intervention increased the overall antioxidant 
protection of HDL particles on LDLs and incremented 
PON1 arylesterase activity. This augmentation in PON1 
function seemed independent of the benefits of the TMD-
VOO intervention on other HDL functions. Although not 
directly assessed in this study, the different bioactive 
compounds in the TMD (olive oil phenolic compounds,18 
carotenoids such as lycopene,13 and omega-3 polyun-
saturated fatty acids14) may act synergistically and could 
induce local antioxidant functions, preserve other di-
etary antioxidants in HDL lipoproteins (such as vitamin 
E), and protect PON1 against oxidative modifications or 
enhance its function.37,38
HDL particles can also counteract the proinflamma-
tory effects of pro-oxidant substances such as modified 
LDL as a result of the combined action of HDL-associat-
ed proteins.19,34 Low HII values reflect an increase in HDL 
anti-inflammatory properties.19 HII has been shown to be 
abnormally elevated in subjects with cardiovascular pa-
thologies and can discriminate patients with acute coro-
nary syndrome from those with stable angina or healthy 
control subjects.19 In the present study, the low-fat con-
trol diet increased HII values, but the TMD interventions 
did not. Further studies are warranted because to date 
no diet-based intervention has been shown to be able to 
improve the HII significantly.
In addition to cholesterol transport, antioxidative, and 
anti-inflammatory functions, HDL lipoproteins have endo-
thelial vasoprotective properties,39 which are impaired in 
high-cardiovascular-risk states.40 In the present trial, the 
TMD-VOO intervention increased the capacity of isolated 
HDL to induce the production of nitric oxide from endo-
thelial cells, a vasodilatory trait (which can also be con-
sidered vasoprotective). This increase in HDL endothelial 
protection seemed to be independent of the benefits of 
the TMD-VOO intervention on other HDL functions, as in 
the case of the improvement in the PON1 function. HDL 
particles with a high content of sphingosine-1-phosphate,

a low content of oxidized lipids, and a stronger capac-
ity to perform ABCG1-dependent cholesterol efflux have 
been associated with a greater ability to maintain endo-
thelial homeostasis.39 Weight losses resulting from gas-
tric surgery20 and an aerobic exercise training program41 
have increased the ability of HDL to induce the release 
of nitric oxide from endothelial cells in previous trials. 
However, TMD is the first dietary modification that has 
been shown to promote HDL vasoprotective properties.
A potential explanation for the TMD-mediated increase 
in HDL functionality could be an improvement in the oxi-
dative status of the lipoprotein.27 In our trial, although 
the TMD-VOO intervention and the low-fat diet led to a 
decreased oxidation of HDL particles, the lipoproteins 
were more resistant against dynamic oxidation only after 
the TMD-VOO intervention. Both the TMD-VOO and low-fat 
interventions were rich in fruits and vegetables.15 Some 
antioxidants such as carotenoids are highly present in 
both, bind to HDL lipoproteins, and protect them locally 
against oxidative modifications.13 However, antioxidant 
protection could be greater in the TMD because of a 
higher content of its particular antioxidants such as olive 
oil phenolic compounds.11,38
Another mechanism that could explain the benefits of 
the TMD on HDL function could be a better HDL com-
position profile. Both TMD interventions decreased the 
content of triglycerides in the HDL core. Low-fat diets 
are known to induce transient hypertriglyceridemias,42 
which could lead to an indirect hypertriglyceridemic 
state in HDL particles. Nevertheless, HDL hypertri-
glyceridemias appeared to be reversed by the TMD in 
our trial. In the specific case of the TMD-VOO interven-
tion, the decreased CETP activity could help to explain 
the reduced triglyceride content in HDL lipoproteins, 
as observed in our data. In the particular case of the 
TMD-Nuts intervention, the nut consumption may have 
decreased systemic triglyceride levels43 and indirectly 
reduced HDL triglyceride content. These decrements 
in the HDL triglyceride content after the TMD interven-
tions are associated with a more stable conformation 
of ApoA-I in the HDLs44 and could partially explain the 
improved HDL role in cholesterol efflux capacity and an-
tioxidant functions.
Continuing with HDL composition, after the TMD-VOO 
intervention, HDL particles had more phospholipids in 
their surface. As has been associated in our data, the im-
proved HDL capacity to esterify cholesterol may explain 
this change: When the free cholesterol content in the 
surface decreases, the relative content of phospholipids 
increases. This could be linked to a greater HDL fluidity, 
which has already been observed after the consumption 
of virgin olive oil11,38 and could contribute to explaining 
an increased HDL functionality.
Some parameters related to the structure of HDL 
such as the HDL-C/ApoA-I ratio in plasma also improved 
after the TMD interventions. A decrease in the HDL-C/
ApoA-I balance could be beneficial because high values 
of this ratio have been associated with increased cardio-
vascular and all-cause mortality.45
Last, size is also a major but controversial trait of 
lipoproteins. Large HDL particles may be atheroprotec-
tive because of their ability to mediate ABCG1- and SRBI-
dependent cholesterol efflux capacity, whereas small 
and lipid-free HDL lipoproteins could also be beneficial 
through their ability to promote the ABCA1-dependent ef-
flux phenomenon.24,46 The ability of the TMD and some of 
its bioactive components (olive oil phenolic compounds) 
to increase the levels of large HDL particles has already 
been described in previous trials.11,47
The present study has several strengths. First, it 
involves a large sample size (n=296). Second, it pres-
ents a randomized design with the presence of an 
active comparator (low-fat diet). Third, its duration is 
long (1 year of follow-up). Last, it comprehensively as-
sesses diverse HDL functions and HDL quality-related 
characteristics. Nevertheless, it also has limitations. 
The participants of the trial were elderly people at high 
cardiovascular risk, which hinders the extrapolation of 
our results to the general population. As expected, we 
found only slight differences because the trial is based 
on modest real-life modifications of the diet and the 
control diet is already a well-known healthy dietary pat-
tern. The use of cellular models, although a noninvasive 
alternative to test relevant physiological functions, may 
not have demonstrated the effect of contraregulatory 
mechanisms, which can modify the final in vivo out-
come in humans. Because of availability issues, in the 
samples from 2 study centers (n=67), we could not 
perform the analyses related to HDL main enzymatic 
proteins (CETP and PON1 activities and LCAT mass). 
In the samples from 1 study center (n=37), we were 
also unable to assess HDL size. Last, we could not per-
form HDL vasodilatory capacity analyses in 16% of the 
individuals in all the interventions because of technical 
issues in cell cultures.
CONCLUSIONS
We report the effects of an integral dietary intervention 
on HDL functionality. To date, this is the first randomized 
controlled trial to study simultaneously 4 key HDL func-
tional traits (cholesterol efflux capacity, HDL-C metabo-
lism, HDL antioxidant/anti-inflammatory properties, and 
vasoprotective effects) in a large sample size and with 
an extended duration of the intervention. Adherence to a 
TMD, especially when enriched with virgin olive oil, was 
associated with increases in these 4 key HDL functions. 
The TMD could have induced these benefits through im-
provements in HDL oxidative status, composition, and 
size. Our data support the improvement in HDL function 
after following a TMD. Further studies are warranted to 
investigate the mechanism by which the TMD improves
