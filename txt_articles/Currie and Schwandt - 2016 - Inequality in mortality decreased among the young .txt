Abstract
Many recent studies point to increasing inequality in mortality in the United States over the past 
20 years. These studies often use mortality rates in middle and old age. We used poverty level 
rankings of groups of U.S. counties as a basis for analyzing inequality in mortality for all age 
groups in 1990, 2000, and 2010. Consistent with previous studies, we found increasing inequality 
in mortality at older ages. For children and young adults below age 20, however, we found strong 
mortality improvements that were most pronounced in poorer counties, implying a strong decrease 
in mortality inequality. These younger cohorts will form the future adult U.S. population, so this 
research suggests that inequality in old-age mortality is likely to decline.
Poorer people tend to have shorter lives and are more likely to die than richer people at all 
ages. Understanding the evolution of these inequalities in mortality is a central concern of 
economists, policy-makers, and the public. Not surprisingly, a great deal of highly 
publicized research has investigated changes in inequality in life expectancy and mortality in 
the United States over the past 20 years. A preponderance of the existing evidence points to 
alarming increases in inequality in mortality over this time period (1–16). Some studies 
investigating mortality trends across educational groups and geographic areas argue not only 
that inequality in life expectancy is widening, but that overall life expectancy is actually 
falling among the most disadvantaged groups (11–13).
However, much of the recent literature focuses on adults, and in particular on life expectancy 
at age 40 or 50, exploiting rich data sets that link individuals’ career earnings to deaths at 
older ages (1–8). By construction, these analyses omit children, teens, and young adults. A

 second strand of research analyzes demographic subgroups defined by education, location, 
and/or race (9–16). These studies typically focus on overall life expectancy at birth.
Life expectancy at birth is a summary measure that collapses all of the age-specific mortality 
rates observed in a given year (and in a certain demographic subgroup) into a single number. 
It provides information about how long a cohort of newborns can expect to live, under the 
assumption that the age-specific mortality rates observed in that given year remain constant 
into the future. This assumption is unlikely to hold in the United States, given that mortality 
rates at all ages have been continuously changing (mostly improving) over the past century 
(17).
Changes in infant and childhood mortality have been shown to be important predictors of a 
cohort’s health and mortality at later ages, and such data may therefore be more informative 
about the development of future death rates for the current young. Moreover, mortality at 
young ages is considered a sensitive indicator of social conditions because it responds 
relatively quickly to changes affecting the entire population, whereas old-age mortality is 
partly determined by conditions in the past. The infant mortality rate has been shown to be 
an important indicator of health for whole populations and one that is highly correlated with 
more complex measures such as disability-adjusted life expectancy (18).
Therefore, to study how inequality in mortality changes over time, it is important to 
understand age-specific mortality trends and in particular those at younger ages. Life 
expectancy at birth masks potential differences in age-specific trends, and the measure is 
also dominated by changes in old-age mortality because that is when most deaths occur. A 
recent study by Case and Deaton (19) highlights the relevance of examining age-specific 
mortality rates: They document increases in middle-age mortality for non-Hispanic whites, a 
striking development that would not be detectable in overall life expectancy at birth.
We followed an empirical approach, based on placing counties into groups, that allows us to 
analyze trends in age-specific mortality while taking into account population shifts across 
groups. We ranked all counties in 1990, 2000, and 2010 by their poverty level and then 
divided them into 20 groups, each representing roughly 5% of the overall U.S. population 
(fig. S1 and table S1). This enables us to compare, for example, the 5% of the population 
living in the poorest counties in 1990 with the 5% of the population living in the richest 
counties in 1990, and analyze how the mortality differences between these groups change 
over time. We refer to the county groups with the highest fractions of their populations in 
poverty as the poorest counties, and those with the lowest fractions of their populations in 
poverty as the richest counties.
Our approach reassigns county groups in 1990, 2000, and 2010 to adjust for changes in 
county ranking and population size. That is, we compare the poorest counties representing 
5% of the population in 1990 with the poorest counties representing 5% of the population in 
2010, even if they are not exactly the same counties. The advantages of this procedure and a 
comparison with other approaches are discussed below. Our county grouping approach is 
similar to that of Singh and Siahpush (9), who investigated life expectancy trends ranking 
U.S. counties by a deprivation index (comprising a set of county characteristics) up to 2001.

 Our approach differs from theirs in that they did not analyze age-specific mortality, analyzed 
data only up to 2001, and did not reorder county groups over time.
Mortality rates were constructed at the levels of county group, gender, and age by dividing 
death counts from the U.S. Vital Statistics by population counts from the decennial Census. 
We focused on 3-year mortality rates for Census years 1990, 2000, and 2010, based on a 
total of 21,175,011 deaths. Life expectancy was calculated by constructing a life table based 
on 19 age groups (see the supplement for additional details regarding the construction of 
mortality rates and life expectancy). Socioeconomic county characteristics, including 
poverty rate, median and per capita income, and percentage of high school dropouts, were 
taken from the Census in 1990 and 2000. For 2010 we used the 2008–2012 American 
Community Survey (ACS), which replaced the long form of the Census for 2010. Table S1 
reports socioeconomic characteristics for the 20 county groups. The county group with the 
lowest fraction living in poverty had an average poverty rate of 3.75% and a median income 
(averaged across counties) of $62,445 in 1990. The comparable 2010 figures are 5.58% in 
poverty and a $62,752 median income. The county group with the highest fraction living in 
poverty had a 30.47% poverty rate and a median income of $23,595 in 1990. Comparable 
2010 figures were 28.30% in poverty and a median income of $25,404.
We start with the analysis of overall life expectancy at birth, so as to make a better 
comparison with the strand of previous literature that has focused on this measure. Figure 
1A plots male and female life expectancies at birth for the 20 county groups in 1990, 2000, 
and 2010 (see table S2 for numerical values and standard deviations). Standard deviations 
are within 0.1% of the estimates, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) would be fully covered 
by the estimate markers if plotted in Fig. 1A. In addition to the plotted life expectancy 
values, we have drawn a linear regression line through the 20 dots representing each year 
(the line for 2000 omits symbols to reduce clutter). A steeper slope of the regression line 
indicates greater inequality in life expectancy. If there was no difference in life expectancy 
between richer and poorer county groups, then the line would be entirely flat.
Figure 1A shows that for men, there is a strong gradient in 1990, with those living in the 
richest counties enjoying 6.10 additional years of life expectancy relative to those living in 
the poorest counties (74.79 versus 68.70). For women, who have greater life expectancy 
overall, this gap is smaller at 3.01 years (80.20 versus 77.19). Between 1990 and 2010, life 
expectancy at birth increased across the entire poverty spectrum, both for men and for 
women. For men, the fitted lines in 1990 and 2010 are almost parallel, suggesting that life 
expectancy increased by similar amounts in rich and poor counties. In fact, residents of the 
poorest counties gained slightly more with 4.63 additional years, whereas those in the richest 
county group gained 4.35 years. For women, improvements were stronger for those in the 
richest county group (3.01 versus 2.06 years), and most of these improvements occurred 
between 2000 and 2010.
Figure 1B plots the changes in life expectancy between 1990 and 2010. For women, the 
fitted regression line is downward-sloping (P = 0.043), indicating increasing inequality in 
life expectancy over this period. For men, the slope of the regression line is positive but not

 significantly different from zero (P = 0.103), consistent with Fig. 1A’s suggestion that 
decreases in mortality were equally distributed across men in rich and poor counties.
Turning to our key innovation—the analysis of age-specific mortality for all ages—Figs. 2 
and 3 show that the evolution of overall life expectancy at birth masks considerable 
heterogeneity in trends in mortality rates at different ages. Similar to Fig. 1, each symbol in 
the figure represents the age-specific 3-year mortality rate in a bin representing 5% of the 
U.S. population, and the bins are ordered by county poverty rates. Mortality rates are plotted 
for 1990 and 2010 together with a linear regression line; only the line is shown for 2000. 
Regression lines are upward-sloping because mortality is higher in poorer counties, but, as in 
Fig. 1, a flattening of the line over time indicates a decrease in inequality. Tables S3 and S4 
report standard errors for the mortality rates and tests for a change in the slope of the fitted 
regression lines.
The first panel in Fig. 2 shows the evolution of 3-year mortality rates for male newborns, 
which decreased by 4.2 per 1000 in the group of richest counties between 1990 and 2010, 
from 9.77 (95% CI, 9.10 to 10.44) to 5.53 (95% CI, 5.06 to 6.00). However, infant mortality 
in the group of poorest counties decreased by 8.49 deaths per 1000, which is more than 
twice as much over the same time period, from 18.28 (95% CI, 17.38 to 19.17) to 9.79 (95% 
CI, 9.22 to 10.37). These strong reductions in mortality in the poorer county groups are 
reflected in a considerable flattening of the regression line in 2010 relative to 1990. The 
slope of the regression line through the group values decreases by more than 50%, and this 
change is highly significant (P < 0.001, table S3). This flattening indicates a marked 
reduction in inequality in infant mortality.
A similar decline in mortality inequality can be observed up to age 20, although 
improvements for young children were greatest between 1990 and 2000. For older children, 
there were also large declines between 2000 and 2010. Looking at older ages, inequality 
decreased (i.e., the slope of the fitted regression line decreased significantly; see table S3 for 
P values) among males up to age 50. Between ages 50 and 75 there was no significant 
change in inequality in mortality, but after age 75, mortality inequality increased 
significantly among males. It is also striking that for adult men between 20 and 34, there was 
virtually no improvement in mortality rates between 2000 and 2010.
Figure 3 shows that the patterns are somewhat different for females. As it did for males, 
female mortality decreased strongly for age groups up to age 19, and these improvements 
were significantly stronger in the poorest counties, implying that inequality in mortality 
decreased sharply (see table S4 for P values of the differences in the slopes). However, 
although inequality decreased significantly for males until age 50, this trend is observed for 
females only up to age 30. For ages 30 to 45, there is no significant change in mortality 
inequality, whereas for all age groups over 45, inequality in mortality increases.
Turning to the mortality rates themselves, it is noteworthy that there was practically no 
improvement in mortality among women aged 30 to 45 between 1990 and 2010. This is a 
striking development in light of the progress made in other age categories. A further 
remarkable fact is that mortality rates actually increased in some of the richest counties

 among females aged 20 to 29. After age 45, there are mortality declines, but they are larger 
in the richer county groups, driving the increase in mortality inequality noted above.
The results discussed so far are all based on ranking counties by poverty rates, which is 
arguably the most relevant measure if one is focusing on differences between the rich and 
poor. However, several additional measures of socioeconomic status are available at the 
county level. The age-specific trends in mortality are very similar when ranking counties by 
these alternative measures, including the share of high school dropouts, median income, and 
average life expectancy (figs. S2 to S4).
In contrast to many recent analyses of inequality in mortality that focus on life expectancy at 
middle age, we find overall improvements in life expectancy at birth both in counties with 
high poverty rates and counties with low poverty rates. However, we argue that life 
expectancy measures are not (despite their name) intended to be predictive of the number of 
future years of life that any particular cohort can expect to attain, and that it is more 
informative to examine age-specific mortality rates. Our analysis of these rates indicates that 
inequality in mortality between rich and poor counties has strongly declined among infants, 
children, and young adults up to age 30 of either gender, as well as among adult males up to 
age 50. Among older adults, mortality has continued to decline, although declines are 
generally greatest in the richest counties, indicating increasing inequality in mortality, which 
is in line with the literature that has focused on inequality trends at older ages (1–8).
Our focus on using county groups to examine inequality has advantages and disadvantages. 
Unlike subgroups defined by race and education or by individual counties, county groups are 
large enough to provide precise mortality estimates in age ranges with low mortality. 
Moreover, the county of residence is consistently reported both in the Vital Statistics and the 
Census data, which makes mortality rates by county group subject to less measurement error 
than using other demographic groups that can be constructed with these data sets. For 
example, education is often missing from death certificates, and education measures were 
switched from years of schooling to degrees for some states in the mortality files but not in 
the Census. Even race is not always consistently reported. For example, the Census 
introduced multiple race categories in 2000 while the Vital Statistics reports permit only 
single-race identification. These changes in the reporting of race and education introduce a 
fundamental bias because of their different impacts on the numerator and denominator of a 
given subgroup’s mortality rate. And because these biases change over time, they confound 
the estimation of trends in inequality.
Changes in the composition of the analyzed demographic subgroups present another serious 
source of bias (20–23). For example, Olshansky et al. (13) documented decreasing life 
expectancy among non-Hispanic white women without a high school degree between 1990 
and 2008. But the share of the population of white non-Hispanic females in this education 
category fell by about two-thirds between 1990 and 2010, which suggests that the average 
female high school dropout today is much more disadvantaged relative to her peers than the 
average female high school dropout in 1990. Bound et al. (20) argued that there is in fact no 
decrease in life expectancy for the least educated once these compositional changes are 
accounted for. Similarly, single counties that experienced declining life expectancy (11, 12)

 tend to be poor places that have lost population over the past 20 years. If the healthiest 
people leave, then the ones who remain will be less healthy on average, biasing the 
estimated changes in mortality inequality. Our approach accounts for potential 
compositional changes by reordering county groups so that they represent constant shares of 
the population over time. In the context of county groups, however, such compositional 
changes do not seem to play a crucial role, as our results look very similar when we keep the 
county groups assigned in 1990 fixed and follow them up to 2010 (fig. S6).
One limitation of our approach is that it necessarily focuses on differences between groups 
of counties, whereas much of the increase in (for example) individual income inequality may 
be occurring within counties. However, by its nature, mortality must be calculated relative to 
some reference group. Using county groups as the reference allows one to cleanly answer 
questions about inequality between these groups in a way that may not be possible with 
respect to other reference groups, such as education.
What are potential causes for the different age-specific trends that we observe? Aizer and 
Currie (24) highlighted many possible reasons for large reductions in infant mortality among 
the poor, which have reduced inequality in mortality among infants. We are not aware of any 
research that has looked at the causes of reductions in mortality inequality among older 
children and young adult males. Some possibilities include expansions of public health 
insurance (25–29), other social safety net programs such as Head Start (30, 31), and 
reductions in pollution, which tend to have disproportionate effects on the poor (32).
Among older adults, it is likely that at least some of the increasing disparities in mortality 
reflect differential patterns of both taking up and quitting smoking over their life cycles. For 
example, better-educated people stopped smoking much more quickly after the U.S. Surgeon 
General’s 1964 report on the dangers of smoking (33, 34). Improvements in medical care for 
conditions such as heart disease also tend to benefit the rich before they reach the poor. The 
outbreak of the opioid epidemic is another factor that may be driving increased mortality 
inequality and actual increases in mortality rates in middle age (19). As Case and Deaton 
(19) showed, it may be possible to get some insight into these questions by studying the 
causes of death in the Vital Statistics mortality data, although changes in measurement, 
measurement error, and missing data about causes mean that these data have to be 
interpreted cautiously.
Our results point to decreasing inequality in mortality, particularly among the younger 
cohorts who will form the future adult and elderly population of the United States. It is 
possible that survivors who would otherwise have died will be in poor health as they age and 
thus reduce the average level of health in the population. However, another possibility is that 
the declines in mortality at younger ages reflect improvements in the entire underlying 
distribution of health (35). In at least one important example—the case of expansions of 
public health insurance for poor infants and young children in the late 1980s and early 1990s
—the reduced early death rates in these cohorts are associated with better health (27–29) and 
higher earnings (25) as these cohorts reach young adulthood. Thus, there appears good 
reason to hope that today’s young will also be healthier when they reach old age, and that 
inequality in mortality will decrease among these elderly in the future.
