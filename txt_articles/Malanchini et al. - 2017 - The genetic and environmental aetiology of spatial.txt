and general anxiety

Individuals differ in their level of general anxiety as well as in their level of anxiety towards specific 
activities, such as mathematics and spatial tasks. Both specific anxieties correlate moderately with 
general anxiety, but the aetiology of their association remains unexplored. Moreover, the factor 
structure of spatial anxiety is to date unknown. The present study investigated the factor structure of 
spatial anxiety, its aetiology, and the origins of its association with general and mathematics anxiety in 
a sample of 1,464 19-21-year-old twin pairs from the UK representative Twins Early Development Study. 
Participants reported their general, mathematics and spatial anxiety as part of an online battery of 
tests. We found that spatial anxiety is a multifactorial construct, including two components: navigation 
anxiety and rotation/visualization anxiety. All anxiety measures were moderately heritable (30% to 
41%), and non-shared environmental factors explained the remaining variance. Multivariate genetic 
analysis showed that, although some genetic and environmental factors contributed to all anxiety 
measures, a substantial portion of genetic and non-shared environmental influences were specific to 
each anxiety construct. This suggests that anxiety is a multifactorial construct phenotypically and 
aetiologically, highlighting the importance of studying anxiety within specific contexts.
The negative relationship between general anxiety and cognitive and academic performance is now well docu-
mented1. High levels of anxiety have been associated with a wide range of negative educational outcomes, includ-
ing poor academic achievement, early school leaving and failure to succeed in higher education2. A large literature 
review3 and a meta-analysis4 have observed moderate effects in the negative associations between general anxiety 
and academic performance (average r = −0.25); to date, the origins of their association remain unexplored.
Extant literature has also examined the association between anxiety and performance within specific contexts. 
One domain that has received extensive interest is mathematics. Mathematics anxiety, the negative feelings and 
emotional reactions elicited by mathematics or by the prospect of doing a task related to it5, varies in degrees of 
severity and is observed independently from levels of mathematical knowledge6. Studies have observed moderate 
negative correlations between mathematics anxiety and mathematics achievement across ages and educational 
curricula (average r = −0.30)7–11, with the exception of basic numerosity skills, which were found not to share an 
association with mathematics anxiety12.
Mathematics anxiety is also associated with lower rates of involvement in activities that require mathematics7, 
from taking any optional STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) subject in school or uni-
versity, to not choosing professional careers in the STEM fields6. This in turn is related with reduced opportunities 
to develop mathematical skills further13.
Similar cognitive mechanisms were found to characterise the association between anxiety and performance 
in domain-general contexts and in the domain of mathematics. One of the leading cognitive theories of anxiety, 
the attentional control theory (ATC)14 proposes that a disruption in working memory capacity is central to the 
negative link observed between general anxiety and performance. The framework suggests that high levels of 
anxiety interfere with working memory processes, leading to reduced performance efficiency and effectiveness.

Several studies have supported the account14,15. Similarly, research has identified a disruption in working memory 
as characteristic of the association between anxiety and attainment in the domain of mathematics16–18.
As well as being characterised by similar underlying cognitive mechanisms in their association with perfor-
mance, the two anxieties are associated with similar physiological indicators – including rapid pulse, nervous 
stomach, palpitations, dizziness, and tension headaches19,20. Recent studies, using neuroimaging and electrophys-
iological methods, have found an overlap in the brain areas associated with general and mathematics anxiety17,21. 
When children with high mathematics anxiety were presented with mathematical stimuli, they experienced 
increased activation and connectivity in the amygdala, which has also been associated with experiencing general 
anxiety, fear and negative emotions17. Another study using electro-encephalography (EEG) found that the same 
component (the error-related negativity –ERN)22 involved in error-monitoring behaviour in participants suffer-
ing from general anxiety23, was also implicated in error monitoring in mathematics anxiety21.
Although similarities between general and mathematics anxiety were observed in their physiological mani-
festations, cognitive and brain networks, their correlation is only moderate (average r = 0.35)7. This suggests that 
they may be separate constructs, manifesting themselves independently from one another, and characterised by 
different aetiologies.
Only one study to date has explored the aetiology of general and mathematics anxiety and of their association, 
in a sample of 12-year-old twins from the United States24. In this study, genetic factors contributed moderately to 
individual differences in general and mathematics anxiety. Individual-specific environmental factors explained 
the remaining variance in general and mathematics anxiety. Approximately 20% of the same genetic effects and 
7% of the same nonshared environmental effects contributed to the origins of both general and mathematics anx-
iety. However, the majority of the aetiology was specific to each construct24. These findings suggest that, although 
the origins of general anxiety and mathematics anxiety partially overlap, their causes are also partly independent. 
However, the small sample size calls for caution when interpreting findings from this investigation.
Another context-specific anxiety construct that has received considerably less attention in the literature is 
spatial anxiety: the fear of performing tasks that have a spatial component25. Spatial anxiety has been linked to 
a decreased efficiency of orientation strategies25 and increased errors in a navigation task26. Spatial anxiety was 
found to emerge early on, with students in the early years of elementary school already showing variation in their 
degree of spatial anxiety27. In the same study, a negative association was observed between spatial anxiety and 
performance in a mental rotation task. Consistent with findings in the domain of mathematics anxiety18, this 
negative association was found predominantly in children with higher working memory skills. In fact, a similar 
disruption in working memory processes has been proposed to moderate the negative association between spatial 
anxiety and performance in spatial tasks28. Because spatial ability is a predictor of positive academic outcomes 
such as achievement in mathematics and science28,29, and success in STEM careers30, exploring the structure and 
origins of its affective correlates is of substantial importance.
To date, several aspects of spatial anxiety remain unexplored. Spatial anxiety has mostly been investigated 
in the context of navigation and orienting. Most of the existing self-report measures designed to assess spa-
tial anxiety (e.g. the Way-Finding Strategy Scale25) have focused on exploring anxiety towards navigation or 
map reading skills. Only one instrument to date has been designed to assess anxiety in relation to other spatial 
abilities, such as mental rotation, visualization and object manipulation in young children (the Child Spatial 
Anxiety Questionnaire –CSAQ27). However, information on the factor structure of the CSAQ is not available, 
and only a total score for the questionnaire, combining items assessing several putative aspects of spatial anxiety, 
is recommended based on the internal validity of the measure (alpha = 0.56)27. Therefore, it remains unclear 
whether spatial anxiety is a unitary construct encompassing anxiety towards all spatial abilities (e.g. navigation, 
map reading, mental rotation, visualization, scanning etc.), or a multifactorial construct, characterized by several 
subcomponents. The aetiology of individual differences in spatial anxiety (or anxieties) also remains unexplored.
Up to now, only one study31 has explored the association between spatial anxiety and other anxiety con-
structs – including mathematics anxiety and general anxiety – finding only moderate correlations between them. 
However, their differentiation remains poorly understood. In fact, no study has investigated the potential over-
lap between measures of spatial, mathematics and general anxiety. Importantly, their association has not been 
explored within a genetically informative design. Behavioural genetics methodologies allow for the exploration 
of the origins of individual differences in specific traits as well as of the co-variation between multiple traits. 
Exploring the association between spatial, mathematics and general anxiety within a genetically informative 
design is likely to enhance our understanding of the origins of their association. This allows us to investigate to 
what extent the same genes, shared environments and individual-specific environments contribute to variation in 
anxiety across different domains. Importantly, applying a genetically informative design allows for the investiga-
tion of whether the domain-specificity of anxiety constructs, indicated by the moderate phenotypic correlations 
between measures, is reflected in their aetiology.
It is plausible that the aetiology of spatial anxiety is mostly independent from the other anxiety measures, as 
it was observed for mathematics and general anxiety24. This would support the view that anxiety is a complex 
multifactorial construct, comprising domain general and domain-specific aspects that are largely different in 
origins. On the other hand, as spatial and mathematical abilities correlate substantially phenotypically31,32, and 
have been found to share common neural correlates33 and genetic influences34, it is possible that the aetiology 
of spatial and mathematics anxiety also overlap substantially, above and beyond their relationship with general 
anxiety. Answering these questions related to the aetiology of spatial, mathematics, and general anxiety is likely to 
have important implications for both future researches (e.g. molecular genetic research aimed at identifying the 
specific genes related to anxiety in several domains) and practice (e.g. interventions).
Therefore, the present study has three main aims: (1) to explore the factor structure of spatial anxiety; (2) to 
investigate the origins of individual differences in spatial anxiety (or anxieties); and (3) to explore the association 
between general anxiety, mathematics anxiety and spatial anxiety using a genetically informative design, with

the aim of addressing whether they are separate constructs phenotypically and aetiologically. Findings from this 
investigation are likely to have important implications for interventions aimed at alleviating anxiety in both gen-
eral and specific contexts.
Methods
Participants. 
The sample included 2928 twins (1464 pairs): 586 monozygotic (MZ) and 878 dizygotic (DZ) 
pairs; 392 pairs were MZ females, 194 pairs were MZ males, 315 pairs were DZ same-sex females, 157 pairs 
were DZ same-sex males and 406 pairs were DZs of opposite sex. Participants were drawn from the Twins Early 
Development Study (TEDS), a large-scale multivariate longitudinal twin registry based in the United Kingdom. 
All families living in England and Wales who had twin-births between 1994 and 1996 were contacted by the office 
of National Statistics and asked to take part in the study. More than 16,000 families took part at first contact, 
and more than 10,000 twins are still contributing to the study. Important, TEDS was and still is representative of 
the UK population35. The TEDS sample comprises 4 birth cohorts, and not all cohorts participate in every study. 
The current study included participants recruited from the first two TEDS cohorts, aged between 18 and 21. The 
study was approved by the King’s College London ethics committee, and was conducted in accordance with the 
approved guidelines. Participants provided informed consent.
Measures. 
General Anxiety. The 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7)36 was used as a meas-
ure of anxiety. The GAD-7 was originally developed to assess generalized anxiety disorder in clinical samples37. 
Generalized anxiety disorder reflects distress caused by uncontrollable worry about potential future negative 
events38 As well as measuring generalized anxiety disorder, GAD-7 was found to be accurate in identifying other 
related conditions, part of the anxiety umbrella, including panic disorder, social anxiety and post-traumatic stress 
disorder39. GAD-7 has been validated and is considered a reliable measure of anxiety in the general population36. 
Evidence for the validity of GAD-7 as a measure of anxiety in the general population is shown by (1) its correlations 
with individual differences in traits that are usually associated with anxiety, such as depression (positively) and 
self-esteem (negatively) and (2) by the large differences in the GAD-7 mean scores between samples from the gen-
eral population, primary care, and patients diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. The scale asks participants: 
‘How often in the past month have you been bothered by the following problems?’
. Participants have to rate the 7 items 
of the GAD-7 on a 4-point scale, from 1 = not at all to 4 = nearly every day. Examples of items are: ‘Not being able 
to control worrying’
, ‘Have trouble relaxing’
, and ‘Feeling afraid as if something awful might happen’
. The self-report 
measure was administered online. The GAD-7 was previously found to be internally valid (α = 0.89) and reliable 
(test-retest correlation of 0.64)36. In our sample the GAD-7 was also found to be internally valid (α = 0.91).
Mathematics Anxiety. A modified version of the Abbreviated Math Anxiety Scale (AMAS)40 was administered 
to assess mathematics anxiety. The AMAS asks participants to rate how anxious they would feel when facing 
several mathematics-related activities. The measure includes 9 items that are rated on a 5-point scale ranging 
from ‘not nervous at all’ to ‘very nervous’
. Examples of items are: ‘Reading a maths book’ and ‘Listening to a maths 
lecture’
. We modified some of the existing items slightly in order to make the scale age appropriate for our sample, 
as all of our participants had left school, and some were no longer in education (please refer to the SOM for addi-
tional details on all the items included). The AMAS has been widely used and shows excellent internal validity 
(α = 0.90)40. Our modified version of the AMAS also showed excellent internal validity (α = 0.94) and showed 
good test-retest reliability (r = 0.85).
Spatial Anxiety. In order to assess several aspects of spatial anxiety we developed a 10-item questionnaire. Some 
of the items are loosely based on the Way-Finding Strategy Scale25, whereas other items were created for the pur-
pose of the present investigation. Participants were asked to rate on a scale from 1 to 5 (1 = not at all, and 5 = very 
much) how anxious they would feel in situations involving spatial skills such as navigation, way-finding, mental 
rotation and spatial visualization. Exploratory factor analysis (see Supplementary Table S1) showed that the scale 
comprised two main factors: (A) a Navigation Anxiety factor and (B) a Rotation/Visualization Anxiety factor. 
The navigation anxiety factor included items such as: ‘Finding your way around an intricate arrangement of streets’
, 
‘Trying a new shortcut without using a map’
, and ‘Following somebody’s instructions to get somewhere’
. The factor 
showed very good internal validity (α = 0.86). The Rotation/Visualization anxiety factor included items such as 
‘Having to complete a complex jigsaw puzzle’
, and ‘Having to rotate objects in your mind’. This second factor also 
showed good internal validity (α = 0.78; see Supplementary Table S1 and Figure S1 for more details on the factor 
structure of spatial anxiety).
Analyses. 
Phenotypic Analyses. We conducted Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to explore the factor 
structure of the newly developed spatial anxiety scale. We then conducted Confirmatory factor analysis (CA), 
using the statistical package MPlus41, to test whether the factor structure emerging from the exploratory PCA 
was the solution that best fitted the data. Once constructs had been identified and composite variables created, we 
explored their distribution associations using descriptive statistics and correlation. We also conducted univariate 
analyses of variance (ANOVA) to explore sex differences in all measures.
Genetic Analyses. The Univariate ACE Model. We applied the twin method, specifically the univariate ACE 
model, to investigate the origins of individual differences in anxiety measures. The twin method capitalises on the 
fact that monozygotic twins (MZ) share 100% of their genetic makeup and dizygotic twins (DZ) share on average 
50% of the genes that differ between individuals, and on the assumption that both types of twins who are raised 
in the same family share their environments to approximately the same extent42. Comparing how similar MZ 
and DZ twins are for a given trait, it is possible to estimate the relative contribution of genes and environments to 
 www.nature.com/scientificreports/
4

variation in that trait. The twin method decomposes the variance in a trait into additive genetic (A), shared envi-
ronmental (C) and nonshared environmental (E) influences. Additive genetic factors are the sum of the effects 
of all alleles at all loci contributing to the variation in a trait or to the co-variation between traits. Shared envi-
ronmental factors are environmental factors that contribute to similarities between family members. Nonshared 
environmental factors are those that do not contribute to similarities between family members. In the model, 
nonshared environmental variance also includes any measurement error43.
Genetic influence can be estimated by comparing intraclass correlations for MZ and DZ twins. A greater 
similarity between MZ twins than between DZ twins for a specific trait indicates a degree of genetic influence 
on the variance of that trait. Heritability, the amount of variance in a trait that can be attributed to genetic vari-
ance, can be calculated as double the difference between the MZ and DZ twin correlations. The univariate ACE 
model fitting applies full structural equation modelling to the estimation of heritability, shared environmental 
and non-shared environmental effects. Applying full structural equation modelling rather than comparing cor-
relations, allows for the assessment of the goodness of fit of the model by comparing it to the saturated model 
(the model based on the observed data), and to more parsimonious models. Additionally, the univariate model 
estimates confidence intervals for all parameters44.
Full Sex Limitation Model. The univariate model can be extended to the full sex limitation model in order to 
explore whether the aetiology of individual differences in a trait differs depending on sex. The full sex limitation 
model allows for the investigation of both qualitative and quantitative sex differences. Qualitative sex differences 
are observed if different genetic and/or environmental factors influence of a given trait in males and females. On 
the other hand, quantitative sex differences are observed when the factors influencing the variation in a given 
trait are the same (i.e. same genes and same environments) for males and females, but the magnitude of their 
effects differs across sexes. The full sex limitation model is explained in more detail in the Supplementary Material 
(SOM) and elsewhere45.
Correlated Factors Model. The univariate model can be extended to multivariate models to investigate the ori-
gins of the correlation between traits. The correlated factors model (Figure S2) allows for the decomposition of 
the covariance between two traits into genetic, shared and non-shared environmental sources of variance, which 
are derived from the comparison of the cross-twin cross-trait correlations, obtained for MZ and DZ twin pairs. 
Cross-twin cross-trait correlations describe the association between two variables, with twin 1 score on variable 
1 correlated with twin 2 score on variable 2. Cross-twin cross-trait correlations are calculated separately for MZ 
and DZ twins. A higher cross-twin cross-trait correlation for MZ than for DZ twins indicates that genetic factors 
have a degree of influence on the phenotypic relationship between the two traits. For example, the fact that the 
correlation between general anxiety for twin 1 and mathematics anxiety for twin 2 is higher for MZ than for DZ 
twins indicates a degree of genetic influence on the co-variance between general and mathematics anxiety. From 
the estimates obtained for each pairwise association, it is possible to derive the proportion of the phenotypic cor-
relation between variables that can be attributed to genetic, shared and non-shared environmental influences46.
Independent Pathway Model. While the correlated factors model allows for the investigation of the aetiology of 
the co-variation between pairs of variables, multivariate models allow for the exploration of the common aetiol-
ogy across multiple variables. For example, the independent pathway model47 (Fig. 2) allows for the investigation 
of the common aetiology between all variables entered in the model. The model decomposes the common var-
iance between traits into: common and specific genetic (A), shared environmental (C) and nonshared environ-
mental (E) influences. The magnitude of the genetic and environmental influences shared between all variables 
included in the model, is indicated by the size of the common A, C and E paths. This allows for the investigation 
of the extent to which the same genes and same environments are implicated in the origins of the co-variation 
between all traits included in the model. The effect of the residual (not shared between the variables included in 
the model) genetic, shared and non-shared environmental influences on every variable is indicated by the specific 
A, C, and E path estimates (see Figure S3).
Results
Factor Structure of Spatial Anxiety. 
To create a fully independent sample, all phenotypic analyses were 
conducted using data from one randomly-selected member of each twin pair. Similar results were obtained when 
the same analyses were performed on the other half of the sample – providing a built-in replication. We acknowl-
edge, that this does not provide a full replication, as the other half of the sample did not provide us with the fully 
independent sample (i.e. including the other twin within each pair, who are genetically related).
PCA was used to explore the factor structure of anxiety. All the items included in the three anxiety meas-
ures (general anxiety, mathematics anxiety and spatial anxiety) were included in the analyses. Four clear factors 
emerged (Supplementary Figure S1 and Table S1). The first factor included all the items in the mathematics anxi-
ety scale and explained 35.8% of the total variance. The second factor included all the items in the general anxiety 
scale and explained 13.2% of the total variance. The third factor, including six out of the ten items included in the 
spatial anxiety questionnaire, explained 9.3% of the variance; all items were relevant to navigation and way find-
ing, therefore, we named this factor navigation anxiety. The fourth factor, explaining 6% of the variance, included 
three other items of the spatial anxiety scale; all describing the anxiety experienced while performing small-scale 
spatial tasks, such as mental rotation and visualization. This fourth factor was named rotation/visualization anxi-
ety. Only one item in the spatial anxiety questionnaire loaded similarly on both factors 3 and 4, and was excluded 
from composite creation and further analyses.
Confirmatory factor analysis (FA) corroborated the factor structure observed from PCA. The four-factor 
model was the best fit for the data if compared to more parsimonious models (Supplementary Table S2).

Descriptive Statistics and Correlations. 
Descriptive statistics for all anxiety measures are reported in 
Supplementary Table S3.
Pairwise associations between all variables are reported in Table 1. Correlations between all anxiety measures 
were moderate, with r coefficients ranging from 0.26 to 0.45.
Sex differences. 
Table S4 presents the results of four ANOVAs, performed to explore sex differences in all 
anxiety measures. We observed significant sex differences for all measures, with females showing higher anxiety 
scores than males. However, sex only accounted for between 1.3% and 5.5% of the variance in anxiety. For subse-
quent analyses, the measures were corrected for the small age and sex differences using linear regression.
Full Univariate Sex Limitation Models. 
Because we found significant, although small, phenotypic sex 
differences for all measures, we ran four univariate full sex limitation models (Supplementary Table S5) to inves-
tigate whether the aetiology of variation in anxiety measures was the same or different for males and females. We 
did not find qualitative sex differences, indicating that the same factors contributed to individual differences in all 
measures of anxiety for both males and females. The results indicated some significant quantitative sex differences 
in the aetiology of all measures; however, the confidence intervals around A, C ad E estimates for boys and girls 
were largely overlapping. Consequently, we included all MZ and DZ pairs in our analyses in order to maximise 
power. Although our sample included more than 1,400 twin pairs, we may have lacked power to detect small 
quantitative sex differences48.
The Aetiology of Individual Differences in Anxieties. 
Univariate genetic analyses were used to explore 
the origins of individual differences in the four anxiety variables. Based on the observed intraclass correlations 
(Table 2), we ran four univariate ADE models to investigate the origins of individual differences in general, math-
ematics, navigation and rotation/visualization anxiety. The ADE model (described in SOM) decomposes the vari-
ance in a trait into additive genetic (A), non-additive genetic (D) and non-shared environmental (E) components. 
After comparing model fit indices (Supplementary Table S7), the more parsimonious AE model was found to be 
the best fit for all variables, indicating that non-additive genetic influences did not contributed significantly to 
explaining variation in anxiety measures.

Table 2 shows that additive genetic factors (A) contributed moderately to variation in all anxiety measures. 
Non-shared environmental factors (E), which include measurement error, accounted for the rest of the variance 
in all measures.
The Origins of the Co-variation between Measures of Anxiety: Multivariate Genetic Analyses. 
 
Figure 1 and Table 3 present the results of the correlated factors model. The more parsimonious AE model best 
fitted the data (Supplementary Table S8), indicating that shared environmental factors did not contribute to 
explaining the origins of the co-variation between measures of anxiety. Genetic correlations for all associations 
were moderate to strong, ranging from 0.38 to 0.63. Nonshared environmental correlations were weak to moder-
ate, ranging from 0.13 to 0.38.
Genetic factors explained about half or more of the moderate correlations between anxiety variables (between 
38% and 65%; Table 3). Non-shared environmental influences, which also encompass measurement error, 
explained between 35% and 62% of the phenotypic correlations between measures.
Common Aetiology Across All Anxiety Measures: the Independent Pathway (IP) Model. 
In 
order to explore whether our data could be best summarised by a common genetic and environmental sources 
of variance across all measures, we ran an IP model. The model estimates the extents to which aetiological influ-
ences are common to several measures. The IP model also explores the aetiology of the variance that is not shared 
between variables.
Figure 2 and Table 4 report the results of the independent pathway model. Table 4 presents the standard-
ized paths estimates for the model. Figure 2 presents the standardized squared paths estimates. We found that,

the aetiology of each anxiety construct was largely specific, as evidenced by the significant and substantial residual 
A and E estimates.
We subsequently ran a common pathway (CP) model (SOM), testing whether the aetiology of the four anx-
iety measures could be best described by one common latent factor encompassing genetic and environmental 
sources of influence. We found the CP model to be significantly lower in fit than the IP model, indicating that one 
latent factor encompassing all the common A, C and E influences could not best summarise the aetiology of the 
co-variation between the four anxiety measures (Supplementary Table S9).
Discussion
The present study had three main aims: (1) to explore the factor structure of spatial anxiety; (2) to investigate 
the origins of individual differences in spatial anxiety; and (3) to explore the association between general, math-
ematics and spatial anxiety using a genetically informative design. We found that our measure of spatial anx-
iety included two distinct constructs: navigation anxiety –experienced in situations involving navigation and 
way-finding activities– and rotation/visualization anxiety –relevant to smaller-scale spatial activities such as men-
tal rotation, visualization and object manipulation. Navigation and rotation/visualization anxiety were also largely 
independent from mathematics and general anxiety.

The factor structure of spatial anxiety, as well as the association between its components and mathematics 
anxiety and general anxiety, had not been previously investigated. The majority of previous research focused on 
exploring spatial anxiety only in the context of navigation and way-finding activities. Our results highlight the 
importance of considering another, largely separate, aspect of spatial anxiety, experienced when performing tasks 
such as mental rotation, visualization and object manipulation. This is consistent with studies that did not find an 
association between self-reported navigation ability and mental rotation49. These findings led to the speculation 
that navigation ability is mostly independent from smaller scale spatial abilities such as mental rotation50. Future 
investigations exploring the association between navigation anxiety, rotation/visualization anxiety and spatial 
abilities are needed in order to shed some light not only on the factor structure of spatial abilities, but also on the 
specificity of the association between anxiety and performance in the domain of spatial skills.
We found that females showed significantly higher levels of anxiety than males did in all domains. However, 
effect sizes were weak. Several previous investigations have reported sex differences in general and mathematics 
anxiety, usually finding that females experienced higher levels of anxiety31,51,52. Results are also consistent with a 
study that found that females experienced higher levels of way-finding anxiety than males32. Socio-cultural fac-
tors, such as the gender stereotype surrounding mathematics and, more generally, STEM subjects may contribute 
to these observed sex differences in anxiety. For example, women who value mathematics, and are acquainted 
with the social stereotype that women tend not to do as well as men in mathematics, tend to be the most sensitive 
to the pressure of gender stereotype and to feel anxious about mathematics53. Additionally, the higher levels of 
anxiety reported by females in every domain may partly depend on their greater willingness to disclose their 
levels of anxiety, if compared to males. This is consistent with findings showing that females reported higher trait 
mathematics anxiety; however, no sex differences were observed when state mathematics anxiety was measured 
straight after mathematics lessons54.
Little evidence was found for sex differences in the genetic and environmental architecture of anxiety, suggest-
ing that the same factors are implicated in the aetiology of individual differences in anxiety to a similar extent in 
males and females.
All anxiety constructs were moderately heritable. Nonshared environmental factors, which are factors that 
do not contribute to similarities between twins raised in the same family, explained the remaining variance in all 
measures. Although it is reasonable to assume that shared environmental factors substantially influence anxiety 
levels, our study did not find any significant variance explained by these factors. This is consistent with previous 
research that found that shared environmental factors explained little or no variance in the aetiology of other 
non-cognitive traits related to individual differences in performance, such as motivation55 and personality56.
Our results are in line with those presented in the Wang et al. study in a younger sample of 12-year-old stu-
dents24. As heritability estimates are specific to the population for which they are calculated at a particular time57, 
it was important to explore whether genetic factors played a similar role in explaining individual differences in 
a sample of older participants from the UK. Moreover, our study was the first to explore the origins of variation 
in spatial anxiety. Navigation anxiety was found to be moderately heritable, with genetic factors explaining 37% 
of individual differences in the trait. Rotation/visualization anxiety was found to be less heritable, with genetic 
factors explaining 30% of its variance.
Although all anxiety constructs constituted independent factors, all measures correlated moderately. We 
found that genetic factors explained about half or more of these phenotypic associations. For example, we found 
a strong genetic correlation between navigation and rotation/visualization anxiety, indicating that many of the 
same genes are implicated in individual differences in both measures. The strong genetic correlation between 
navigation and rotation/visualization anxiety explained nearly half of their moderate phenotypic correlation, 
and nonshared environmental factors explained the remaining portion. These findings are in line with previous 
research exploring the origins of the association between mathematics and spatial abilities. In fact, genetic influ-
ences were found to explain the largest portion of the covariance between mathematics and spatial abilities in a 
sample of 16 year-old TEDS twins34.
Due to the overlapping aetiologies between pairs of anxiety variables, we explored whether the same aeti-
ological influences underlined all anxiety constructs. Our results showed that some genetic and nonshared 
environmental influences were common to all anxiety measures, indicating that some of the same genes and 
nonshared environments are implicated in individual differences in all anxiety constructs. However, significant 
specific genetic and non-shared environmental influences were also observed. The aetiological overlap between 
anxiety variables is consistent with research suggesting that partly the same physiological19, cognitive6 and brain21 
processes are implicated in both general and mathematics anxiety. At the same time, the specificity observed in 
the aetiology of each measure is consistent with studies suggesting that mathematics and spatial anxiety manifest 
themselves independently from general anxiety24,32.
The specific cognitive and neural processes characterising mathematics and spatial anxiety remain mostly 
unexplored, as research looking into the brain correlates of mathematics anxiety has mainly focused on exploring 
the process shared with general anxiety. However, our results indicate a large degree of specificity in the aetiol-
ogy of general, mathematics and spatial anxiety, which is likely to translate to specific neuronal and cognitive 
processes characterising these constructs. This is in line with evidence suggesting that mathematics anxiety is 
associated with a disruption in the subsystem of visual working memory, while general anxiety interferes with 
the verbal working memory system58. An interesting development for future research would be to identify the 
common and specific processes underlying different anxiety constructs, including specific genes and environ-
ments contributing to the development of domain-general and domain-specific anxiety constructs. The finding 
that a substantial degree of genetic specificity characterizes general, mathematics and spatial anxiety is useful 
for informing future quantitative and molecular research. For example, future genome-wide association studies 
(GWAS) should take into account these results, which suggest that multivariate GWAS (combining samples with 
data on academic anxiety and general anxiety to improve power) will have little hope for finding genetic variance

common to all scales. Additionally, future quantitative research exploring the association between anxiety and 
achievement should take this domain-specificity into account.
To date, only one study has explored the origins of the association between mathematics anxiety and mathe-
matics problem solving skills after accounting for general anxiety, finding a specific genetic link between mathe-
matics anxiety and problem solving skills24. The specificity of the association between anxiety and performance 
remains unexplored in the spatial domain, as well as the specificity of the association between the subcomponents 
of spatial anxiety and different spatial abilities. It is possible that domain-specific anxieties would share a specific 
association with performance in that domain, above and beyond other anxiety measures. For example, it is pos-
sible that a specific association exists between navigation anxiety and navigation ability, above and beyond other 
domain-specific anxiety and ability constructs. Exploring the differential relationship between general, mathe-
matics and spatial anxiety constructs and performance is part of our future plans. Moreover, the origins of these 
associations have not been investigated, and it is unclear whether specific genetic and environmental influences 
underlie the association between anxiety and performance in domain-specific contexts. We plan to explore these 
issues in our future research.
The present results also have important potential implications for interventions aimed at reducing anxiety, as 
they call for the need to intervene at the domain-specific level. For example, the majority of interventions aimed at 
alleviating the negative symptoms of mathematics anxiety have applied techniques that were found to be success-
ful in diminishing general anxiety, with largely unsuccessful results59,60.Our findings suggest that interventions 
targeting general anxiety might only address a small part of the problem experienced by students suffering from 
mathematics and spatial anxiety and call for the need of considering the specificity of each anxiety construct.
The current study presents some of the limitations common to twin studies. One assumption of the twin 
method is the equal environments assumption, the idea that MZ and DZ twin pairs growing up in the same family 
share the same degree of environmental similarity. Although there is evidence suggesting that MZ twins are more 
likely to experience similar environments than DZ twins, for example being treated more similarly, studies have 
shown that sharing more environmental experiences did not impact on the degree of their phenotypic concord-
ance61. A further limitation is that the twin method does not take into account genotype-environment effects such 
as assortative mating, genotype-environment correlation and gene-environment interaction. These limitations of 
the methodology are discussed in detail elsewhere50. Additionally, we only used self-reported measures of anxiety. 
Combining self-reports with other types of assessment, such as for example measuring physiological symptoms, 
skin conductance reactivity62, or cortisol levels63, would likely provide more in depth phenotypic information on 
all anxiety measures and the way they are manifested.
To conclude, the results of the present investigation support a multifactorial view of anxiety, both at the phe-
notypic and aetiological level. Our findings point to the importance of studying anxiety for specific domains. 
Although specific anxiety constructs show an association with the broader general anxiety domain, considering 
general anxiety alone is likely to provide only a partial picture of the apprehension experienced by individuals 
struggling with anxiety in specific fields. We found genetic factors to play a significant role in explaining variation 
in anxiety measures and their co-occurrence. Future genetic studies are likely to be able to identify the polygenic 
bases of anxiety constructs. Identifying the genetic bases of anxiety and of domain specific anxiety constructs 
is a priority, as the anxiety in many fields is negatively associated with emotional wellbeing as well as cognitive 
performance. The findings emerging for the current study benefit future research as well as practice, by providing 
useful knowledge for future studies and interventions aimed at reducing anxiety and at alleviating its negative 
association with performance.
