SUMMARY
For a decade, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) pro-
gram collected clinicopathologic annotation data
along with multi-platform molecular profiles of more
than 11,000 human tumors across 33 different cancer
types. TCGA clinical data contain key features repre-
senting the democratized nature of the data collec-
tion process. To ensure proper use of this large clin-
ical dataset associated with genomic features, we
developed a standardized dataset named the TCGA
Pan-Cancer Clinical Data Resource (TCGA-CDR),
which includes four major clinical outcome end-
points. In addition to detailing major challenges and
statistical limitations encountered during the effort
of integrating the acquired clinical data, we present
a summary that includes endpoint usage recommen-
dations for each cancer type. These TCGA-CDR find-
ings appear to be consistent with cancer genomics
studies independent of the TCGA effort and provide
opportunities for investigating cancer biology using
clinical correlates at an unprecedented scale.
INTRODUCTION
The purpose of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project was to
establish a coordinated team science effort to comprehensively
characterize the molecular events in primary cancers and to pro-
vide these data to the public for use by researchers around the
world. TCGA started in 2006 with a 3-year pilot project focusing
on glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), lung squamous cell carci-
noma (LUSC), and ovarian serious cystadenocarcinoma (OV),
followed by the execution of the full project from 2009 to 2015.
By the end of this 10-year project, TCGA network investigators
had characterized the molecular landscape of tumors from
11,160 patients across 33 cancer types and defined their many
molecular subtypes. The quantity and quality of TCGA molecular
data have been lauded by a large number of scientists, and these
data have resulted in studies that have significantly advanced
our understanding of cancer biology, as documented in
dozens of highly cited published TCGA marker and companion
papers, including those for GBM, OV, and breast, lung, prostate,
bladder, and other individual cancers (Cancer Genome Atlas
Network, 2012, 2015; The Cancer Genome Atlas Research
Network, 2008, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015; Cancer Genome Atlas
Research Network et al., 2017). TCGA data also make possible
studies that compare and contrast multiple cancer types with
the goal of identifying common themes that transcend the tissue
of origin and may inform precision oncology (Hoadley et al.,
2014). In addition, numerous independent investigators have
used TCGA as a resource to support their own studies and to
help interpret molecular testing of individual patients in a clinical
setting (Huo et al., 2017; Verhaak et al., 2010). However, obtain-
ing comprehensive clinical annotation was neither a primary pro-
gram objective nor a practical possibility, given the worldwide
scope and severe time constraints for sample accrual goals

 determined at the time of TCGA program initiation and funding.
The incomplete annotation of patient outcome and treatment
data associated with each TCGA-acquired sample, with its rela-
tively short-term clinical follow-up interval, has been noted by the
research community (Hoadley et al., 2014; Huo et al., 2017). The
limitations of the existing clinical dataset, associated with an
otherwise rich body of genomic and molecular analyses avail-
able across all TCGA tumor types, compels thorough and sys-
tematic curation and evaluation of those clinical endpoints and
other clinical features associated with each TCGA tumor so
that the scientific community can optimize the translational rele-
vance of the tumor-specific genomic and pathway conclusions
drawn from the TCGA program and its pan-cancer analyses. It
is also important to demonstrate that the conclusions drawn
from this newly curated TCGA pan-cancer clinical data resource
have translational validity with respect to both patient prognosis
and outcome parameters.
In clinical studies, 5-year or 10-year benchmark survival rates
are often calculated to convey prognostic information or to
compare treatment effects. These survival rates may be based
on progression or mortality events with or without disease
specificity. For each endpoint, it is very important to have a
sufficiently long follow-up time to capture the events of interest,
and the minimum follow-up time needed depends on both the
aggressiveness of the disease and the type of endpoint
(Tai et al., 2005).
Overall survival (OS) is an important endpoint, with the advan-
tage that there is minimal ambiguity in defining an OS event (Hu-
dis et al., 2007; Punt et al., 2007); the patient is either alive or
dead. However, using OS as an endpoint may weaken a clinical
study as deaths because of non-cancer causes do not neces-
sarily reflect tumor biology, aggressiveness, or responsiveness
to therapy. Using OS or disease-specific survival (DSS) demands
longer follow-up times; thus, in many clinical trials, disease-free
interval (DFI) or progression-free interval (PFI) are used (Hudis
et al., 2007; Punt et al., 2007; https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/plugins/
servlet/mobile#content/view/24279961). The minimum follow-
up time for these endpoints is shorter because patients generally
develop disease recurrence or progression before dying of their
disease. Selection of a specific survival endpoint also depends
on the study goal. For example, a clinical trial testing the effect
of a drug’s ability to delay or prevent cancer progression would
use PFI as the most appropriate endpoint. With specific regard to
the analysis of available TCGA clinical data, it is important to
realize that short-term clinical follow-up intervals favor outcome
analyses in more aggressive cancer types, which are likely to
observe events within a couple of years. Studies with less
aggressive cancer types, in which patients relapse only after
many years or even decades, may not observe enough events
during their follow-up intervals to support reliable outcome de-
terminations. The intent of this analysis is to examine the relative
strengths and weaknesses of the TCGA pan-cancer clinical
outcome measures to guide future analyses and avoid pitfalls
such as insufficient follow-up intervals.
To our knowledge, there has been no systematic attempt to
analyze the TCGA clinical data and derive acceptable outcome
endpoints across all 33 TCGA cancer types involving 11,160 pa-
tients or to assess the adequacy of the clinical follow-up interval
for each survival endpoint test. Here we present curated and
filtered clinical and survival outcome data as a newly integrated
resource for the entire scientific community, describe how prob-
lems encountered while analyzing these data were resolved, and
what pitfalls researchers should be aware of when using these
data for future correlative and survival studies. Based on our
comprehensive clinical review, we also provide scoring recom-
mendations for appropriate future use and tumor-specific
endpoint selection. The resulting compendium of curated data
is now presented as the TCGA Pan-Cancer Clinical Data
Resource (TCGA-CDR) for public access and future translational
cancer research.
RESULTS
The TCGA clinical data were downloaded from the data portal
of the Genomic Data Commons (GDC), where all TCGA mo-
lecular data are also available (https://gdc-portal.nci.nih.gov/
legacy-archive/). The same TCGA barcode structure is used
for both clinical data and molecular data, enabling integrated
analysis of patient-based clinical data and sample-based molec-
ular data.
Cohort Characteristics
Figure 1A shows a flowchart of the methods for clinical data
integration and analysis as well as derivation and evaluation of
4 major clinical outcome endpoints. We processed 33 initial
enrollment data files and 97 follow-up data files for 11,160 pa-
tients across 33 cancer types. Table 1 shows the basic charac-
teristics of each TCGA cohort. Primary tumor samples, not met-
astatic, were typically selected in each cohort for molecular
characterization, with the exception of the skin cutaneous mela-
noma (SKCM) study, which allowed both. A very limited number
of metastatic tumors with matching primary tumors was also
studied for other cancer types. Individual patients’ detailed
data are provided in Table S1, tab TCGA-CDR, and problems
we identified when processing this dataset and the solutions
we developed are described in the STAR Methods.
Clinical Outcome Endpoints of OS, PFI, DFI, and DSS
There are many definitions of clinical outcomes used in oncology
research. After analyzing all TCGA clinical data used for this study,
we concluded that OS and PFI could be derived relatively accu-
rately using the available data. We also derived DFI reasonably
accurately, although, for most cases, DSS could only be esti-
mated. Figure 1B shows the OS Kaplan-Meier (K-M) plots for all
cases of the 33 different cancer types. Although TCGA did not
set survival analyses as a primary program objective, the resulting
survival plots for most cancer types are similar to prior indepen-
dent studies prospectively designed to evaluate these same
survival endpoints. This is perhaps best exemplified by the
TCGA outcomes for GBM, OV (Cancer Genome Atlas Research
Network, 2008, 2011), and lower-grade glioma (LGG) (Cancer
Genome Atlas Research Network et al., 2015). K-M plots for PFI,
DFI, and DSS are shown in Figures 1C–1E (see also Figure S1).
We calculated median follow-up times as well as median times
to event or censorship based on the observed times for these
four endpoints for each cancer type (Table 2; Table S1, tab

when fewer than 10 patients remain at risk. See Figure S1 for plots of the 4 endpoints within each of the 33 tumor types and Tables S1, S2, S3 and S4 for more
detailed information regarding endpoint derivation.

 TCGA-CDR). The overall median follow-up time for all tumors
was 22.1 months, but these times were very different across
cancer types; GBM and acute myeloid leukemia (LAML) had
the shortest (�12 months), whereas kidney chromophobe
(KICH) had the longest (�48 months).
Recommended Use of Clinical Outcome Endpoints
Selection of the clinical outcome endpoints for a specific study
depends on the goals of the study, number of events, cohort
size, and quality of the outcome data. Methods are available to
assess the quality of survival outcome data (Maller and Zhou,

 1994; Shen, 2000). We applied these methods, and others
we developed, as tests 1–3 and a supplemental check, to this
dataset of individual diseases. We provided recommendations
regarding how each outcome’s endpoints should be used within
each disease type, with concerns justified in comments (Table 3).
Survival endpoints for each cancer type that passed at least
one of the main tests as well as the supplemental check were
considered acceptable for use. Overall, we recommend use of
all four endpoints without reservation for 13 of the 33 cancer
types: bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), cervical squamous
cell carcinoma (CESC), colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), esopha-
geal carcinoma (ESCA), head and neck squamous cell carci-
noma (HNSC), kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP),
lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), LUSC, OV, pancreatic adenocar-
cinoma (PAAD), sarcoma (SARC), stomach adenocarcinoma
(STAD), and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC). In
contrast, none of the four outcome endpoints can be recommen-
ded for use in the TCGA pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma
(PCPG) cases. For lymphoid neoplasm diffuse large B-cell lym-
phoma (DLBC), LAML, and thymoma (THYM), only one endpoint
can be recommended for use; for all other cancer types, either
two or three endpoints can be recommended, some with partic-
ular reservations. Generally, the most reliable of all four end-
points, PFI, could be recommended for use without reservation
in all but 4 of the 33 cancer types, the 4 exceptions being
LAML (no data), DLBC and KICH (use with caution), and PCPG
(not recommended). Thus, despite the impression held by
many that TCGA follow-up times are too short for meaningful

 endpoint analyses, in fact, they are sufficiently long for many
endpoint determinations in the more aggressive tumor types
and for determination of PFI in most tumor types, where disease
progression events occur well before death events. The Cumula-
tive event plots of OS, DSS, DFI, and PFI for each of 33 tumor
types are provided in Figure S2.
Validation and Application Examples
In breast cancer studies, patients with estrogen receptor-
negative (ER�) tumors have worse clinical survival outcomes
compared with those with ER-positive (ER+) tumors. To evaluate
the derived clinical endpoints, we compared the survival of pa-
tients with these two types of tumors using OS, PFI, DFI, and
DSS, respectively (Figures 2A–2D; plots truncated at 10-year
follow-up time, but analyses were conducted using the whole
dataset following Huo et al., 2017). Univariate analyses showed
that TCGA breast cancer patients with ER+ tumors had
better survival than patients with ER� tumors when using PFI
(p = 0.005) and DFI (p = 0.001) as clinical endpoints, but there
was no sufficient evidence of a difference when using OS as
the endpoint (p = 0.097). We also noticed that there was a signif-
icant difference in (approximated) DSS (p = 0.009), demon-
strating the potential value of this estimated endpoint. As noted
in Table 3, although we caution against using breast invasive car-
cinoma (BRCA) data to determine OS and DSS, the above find-
ings validate our recommended use of PFI and DFI as suitable
endpoints for specific types of breast cancer molecular studies.
We also examined the survival outcome endpoints of a more
aggressive cancer type, GBM. The TCGA GBM median OS
was 12.6 months, which falls between the previously reported
12.1 months with standard care and 14.6 months with standard
care plus temozolomide (Stupp et al., 2005). The median PFI was
6.1 months, which falls between the reported 5.0 months with
standard care and 6.9 months with standard care plus temozo-
lomide (Stupp et al., 2005). Thus, the event time for OS and
PFI derived from this TCGA dataset is consistent with the litera-
ture, an observation previously noted for OS in the initial GBM
marker paper when only 185 cases were analyzed (Cancer
Genome Atlas Research Network, 2008). This example again
confirms the validity of OS and PFI as recommended clinical
endpoints for correlation with GBM molecular studies.
We validate the curated TCGA-CDR data by using Cox propor-
tional hazards regression models to determine the hazard ratio
(HR) for patients with high-stage (III, IV) disease relative to patients
with low-stage (I, II) disease for each of the four endpoints. Tumor-
specific American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) pathology
stages (Amin et al., 2017) were employed following the then-
current version used at each tissue source site (TSS). Because
the definition of DFI was not consistent with that of other out-
comes (i.e., cases with a follow-up of less than 90 days were
excluded, so were de novo stage IV cases), we compared the
logHRs of the stage-based measurements using the three other
endpoints (OS, PFI, and DSS) for the 14 cancer types in which
these outcome endpoints were recommended for use (Table 3).
Subsequent statistical analyses using only diseases satisfying
the Cox proportional hazards assumption (Grambsch and
Therneau, 1994) were performed (Figures 2E–2G; Table S1, tab
Figure 2EFG_AdditionalInfo). Our results showed that the high-
stage HR was significantly larger than unity for most of the
14 cancer types and across the three recommended endpoints,
with the exception of mesothelioma (MESO), PAAD, and uveal
melanoma (UVM), which were not significantly different for high-
versus low-stage disease for either OS, PFI, or DSS. K-M plots
for these analyses are provided in Figure S3. Using paired
Wilcoxon signed-rank test, the logHRs were significantly different
when measured by PFI versus DSS (p = 0.0008) or PFI versus OS
(p = 0.039), indicating evidence of a systematic difference in HR
between the progression and survival endpoints. There was not
significant evidence of a systematic difference between OS
versus DSS (p = 0.106). Using Pearson correlation coefficients
weighted by the inverse mean of two standard errors of the logHR
values, we observed very strong positive associations between
logHR estimates for all three outcomes: the correlation coefficient
was 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.77–0.99) between PFI
and OS, 0.95 (95% CI: 0.76–0.99) between PFI and DSS, and
0.90 (95% CI: 0.61–0.98) between OS and DSS. Notably, these

 Figure 2. Validation and Application Examples
(A–D) Clinical survival outcomes of breast cancer patients with ER+ or ER� tumors using (A) OS, (B) PFI, (C) DFI, and (D) DSS as the endpoint, respectively. Plots
were truncated at 10 years, but the analyses were conducted using all of the data.
(E–G) Pairwise plots comparing natural logHRs for event development measured by three different clinical endpoints (OS, DSS, and PFI), with natural logHRs
calculated for high-stage (III, IV) disease relative to low-stage (I, II) disease: (E) PFI versus OS, (F) PFI versus DSS, and (G) OS versus DSS. Here 14 diseases for
which these three endpoints are recommended for use are analyzed. The blue diagonal lines illustrate equal logHRs measured by each endpoint pair. Error bars
represents the standard errors of logHR. Red error bars show models that did not satisfy the PHs assumption.

 correlations support the potential clinical use of earlier-determined
PFI as a proxy for later-determined OS and DSS endpoints
(Shi and Sargent, 2009).
Apart from integration with the molecular data, there are many
ways to use the pan-cancer data in this TCGA-CDR. As one
application of the TCGA-CDR, we looked to see whether the like-
lihood of developing a new tumor event (NTE) differed between
patients who were disease-free relative to those not disease-
free following primary therapy. Twenty-nine cancer types in our
TCGA-CDR had the information for addressing this question.
For this analysis, we included patients who survived at least
3 months from diagnosis to approximate the time patients
required to complete primary therapy and achieve a disease
free state (i.e., to prevent immortal time bias in the disease-
free group; Anderson et al., 1983; Giobbie-Hurder et al., 2013).
Using LUSC as an example, there were 289 disease-free cases
and 41 never disease-free cases with a 21.8% and 68.2% NTE
rate, respectively. Using the Cox proportional hazards regres-
sion model, the risk of developing an NTE in LUSC patients
who never became disease-free was significantly higher than
that of those who were disease-free (HR = 6.68, 95% CI =
4.25–10.51, false discovery rate [FDR] adjusted q value < 0.05).
Similar results were observed in another 21 cancer types
(Table 4). Of the remaining 7, we did not see these differences
but caution that majority had few patients at risk. We also as-
sessed whether each model satisfied the proportional hazards

 assumptions (Table S1, tab Table4_PHAssumptionTests). Two
did not meet the assumptions because of causes that remain
to be studied with time-dependent or multivariable models.
The K-M plots for these analyses are provided in Figure S4.
The above two study examples, comparing outcome differ-
ences between high- and low-stage disease and between pa-
tients rendered disease-free or not, demonstrated consistency
with our known understanding of the effect of these factors on
patient outcomes and, therefore, not only further validate the
TCGA-CDR findings but also illustrate how this large clinicopath-
ologic resource can be used to conduct translational cancer
research at an unprecedented scale.
TCGA cases were collected from hundreds of sites worldwide,
including some tissue bank networks with limited clinical infor-
mation. There were also differences in the number of retrospec-
tively and prospectively collected samples by site. To address
whether clinical data were comparable from site to site, multiple
factors, including the completeness of the data, tumor charac-
teristics, and patient characteristics, need to be taken into ac-
count. For each disease, we compared the top two TSSs (i.e.,
the two TSSs that provided the largest number of cases for
each disease) against all other submitting sites for the same dis-
ease and for each of the four outcome endpoints (Table 5). Addi-
tionally, we tested for satisfaction of proportional hazards
assumption (Table S1, tab Table5_PHAssumptionTest), and
models not satisfying the assumption were flagged. The detailed
K-M plots for each of the 33 disease sets are shown in Figure S5.
We observed that, for a highly aggressive tumor like GBM,
these top two TSSs (#1 and #2) had similar OS, PFI, and DSS out-
comes compared with the disease population from other TSSs,
whereas events evaluated by the not-recommended endpoint
DFI were too few to be analyzed. For a less aggressive tumor
type like BRCA, we recommended use of PFI and DFI without
reservation but suggested caution when assessing either OS
or DSS. For TSS #1, their clinical data generated worse OS
and DSS outcomes and showed no observed difference in their
PFI relative to the other sites. However, this same TSS generated
a nominally better DFI outcome, having accrued only 3 DFI
events.
Such
nominally
inconsistent
results
suggest
that
the outcome data from this site need to be further evaluated.
TSS #2, on the other hand, consistently generated outcomes
comparable with those from other sites across all 4 endpoints.
This simple outcome comparison test suggests that TSS-spe-
cific information might need to be taken into account when
analyzing the entire body of TCGA clinical data for specific out-
comes. Because endpoint-confounding factors from different
TSS populations might include patient age, tumor stage/grade,
and treatment, TSSs might serve as a proxy for these as well
as other unmeasured differences, including incomplete clinical
annotation. For this purpose, we have included the key to trans-
late the TSS element of the patient barcode in Table S1, tab
TSS_Info.
DISCUSSION
This TCGA-CDR (Table S1, tab TCGA-CDR) was created as the
result of a systematic review of TCGA pan-cancer clinical data
where we calculated, assimilated, and evaluated four commonly

 used clinical outcome endpoints (OS, PFI, DFI, and DSS; Fig-
ure 1) for each of the 33 different TCGA cancer types analyzed
by the network over the past decade (Table 1). In this effort,
we processed and merged data for 10 data elements from the
initial patient enrollment data file and subsequent follow-up
data files. Another 11 commonly used clinical data elements
were also extracted from the initial patient enrollment data file,
with quality assessed for inclusion in the TCGA-CDR. A flag for
case redaction status was also included; e.g., when the subject
withdrew consent or in the cases of genotype mismatch. To
accomplish this pan-cancer effort and also address the many
data-cleaning issues requiring resolution before finalizing this
new scientific resource, we consulted with various TCGA Anal-
ysis Working Group (AWG) experts and worked closely with
TCGA Biospecimen Core Resource (BCR) personnel who origi-
nally collected and curated the data elements for each AWG.
Beyond resolving these problematic issues, the quality of each
clinical endpoint was independently evaluated to offer recom-
mendations about their use in future studies (Table 3).
Despite the relatively short follow-up time across all TCGA
clinical data (Table 2), a limited number of AWG marker papers
contained survival analyses employing a few specific endpoints,
including GBM, where only OS was used in the initial analysis
(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2008), OV (Cancer
Genome Atlas Research Network, 2011) and LGG (Cancer
Genome Atlas Research Network et al., 2015), where OS was
also used, and UCEC, where PFI was used (Cancer Genome
Atlas Research Network et al., 2013). For future GBM studies,
we can now recommend the use of OS, PFI, and DSS (as an
approximation) with confidence, and for UCEC and OV studies,
we can now confidently recommend the use of all four clinical
endpoints, including DSS, as an approximation (Table 3). In
several TCGA studies, survival analyses were not reported, for
example in prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) and BRCA (Cancer
Genome Atlas Network, 2012; Cancer Genome Atlas Research
Network, 2015). For both PRAD and BRCA, we can now recom-
mend use of PFI and DFI but advise caution when interpreting
OS or DSS for BRCA and do not recommend using OS or DSS
for PRAD (Table 3). Of note, DFI was effectively used in more
recent BRCA racial disparity studies (Huo et al., 2017; Keenan
et al., 2015).
Although OS is the most accurately derived endpoint from
the TCGA clinical data as curated in the TCGA-CDR, our
assessment shows that OS is an appropriate endpoint for
many but not all cancer types. For aggressive TCGA cancer
types like GBM, where the median OS event time was
12.6 months, and the median follow-up of 12 months allowed
capturing events in 82.4% of the cases, OS is an appropriate
clinical endpoint. Likewise, OV cases in the TCGA cohort with
their median OS event time of 35.3 months and an event rate
of 59.5% (349 of 587 cases) proved to be sufficiently aggressive
to support this as an appropriate clinical endpoint (Cancer
Genome Atlas Research Network, 2011). However, for less
aggressive cancer types like BRCA, appropriate use of OS
depends on BRCA subtype. There are 4 primary intrinsic
subtypes of BRCA (Perou et al., 2000), including the most
aggressive basal-like subtype, which commonly recurs within
a few years, in contrast to the least aggressive Luminal A
subtype, which may require 10 years or more to recur. Hence,
given a relatively short follow-up time, OS may be a suitable
endpoint for the basal-like subtype but not for the Luminal A
subtype. For an even less aggressive TCGA cancer type like
PRAD, where there were only 10 OS events out 500 cases,
OS is clearly not a suitable study endpoint (Table 3).
In recommending survival endpoint choices within the TCGA-
CDR, our analysis emphasizes strengths and limitations behind
each of the four different endpoint calculations. For OS, events
are clearly defined by the time of patient death. However, for
much of the TCGA clinical data, DSS had to be approximated
because of lack of absolute verification of the cause of death.
Given the relatively short clinical follow-up records for most of
the TCGA cohorts, PFI and DFI might generally be considered
better clinical endpoint choices than OS and DSS because
patients normally develop disease recurrence before death
and, therefore, more endpoint events are recorded during the
follow-up period. PFI in particular was derived with high confi-
dence and is a recommended clinical endpoint choice for 27 of
the 33 pan-cancer types. In five others, its use is recommended
with caution, and for one (LAML), outcome data are lacking and
PFI is not available. Unlike PFI, calculation of DFI requires that
patients be documented as free of disease at a specific point
in time following their initial diagnosis; because this explicit point
in time was not available in the TCGA clinical dataset, here DFI
event time (or censoring) had to be calculated from the day of
initial diagnosis for cases where there was evidence that primary
treatment (e.g., surgical excision) rendered the patient disease-
free. In analysis (Table 4), we used 90 days past diagnosis as
an approximate duration of the common pan-cancer primary
treatment interval. More precise estimates of treatment duration
may be available per cancer type. Among the 4 endpoints, PFI is
generally considered a more informative endpoint for TCGA
pan-cancer studies; however, DFI is also an excellent endpoint
and should be considered suitable for further research into
many TCGA cancer types.
For clinical survival endpoint analyses, all clinical data we have
processed can be used as recommended. But for integrative
analysis with molecular/genomic data, caution is warranted in
two respects. First, our recommendations are based on baseline
survival models. The inclusion of molecular subgroups as predic-
tors begins to partition the sample sets, potentially compro-
mising the statistical significance of apparent outcome differ-
ences (Peduzzi et al., 1995). Therefore, conclusions drawn
from cross-correlating TCGA molecular data or tumor sub-
groups with TCGA-CDR outcome data should be further vali-
dated on independent tumor datasets. Second, in general, we
recommend use of only molecular data from primary tumors
because the matching clinical data, including important temporal
information, were collected relatively completely for patients at
the time of initial diagnosis. In particular, skin cutaneous mela-
noma (SKCM) is unique among the TCGA tumor types because,
among 470 tumors, only 103 were primary tumors, whereas 296
were regional lymph node metastases, and 68 were distant
metastases. This is in stark contrast to other TCGA cancer types
where few metastatic tumors were collected. Very few SKCM
metastatic tumors had a matching primary tumor, in contrast
to other TCGA cancer types where the few metastatic tumors
Cell 173, 400–416, April 5, 2018
411
 all had matching primary samples. Thus, for SKCM outcome cor-
relations, we recommend using only the limited number of pri-
mary cases, although the SKCM nodal metastases for stage III
cases could be studied as a discrete group.
The curated clinical endpoint results as presented in the
TCGA-CDR are consistent with independent outcome reports
from other comparable cancer cohorts. For example, the OS
and PFI event times we derived for GBM are consistent with
those in the literature (Stupp et al., 2005). We compared
the TCGA-CDR-determined breast cancer outcomes with well-
established survival differences reported between patients
with ER+ and ER� tumors (Ren et al., 2014; Saphner et al.,
1996; Yu et al., 2012). As expected, patients with ER+ tumors
had significantly better outcome differences using PFI, DFI,
and DSS as the end points.
Data from the TCGA-CDR not only enable investigators to
generate results consistent with those from independent studies
but also invite exploration into biologically relevant questions
across multiple cancer types at an unprecedented scale. For
example, we demonstrate that TCGA patients who were never
disease-free after initial diagnosis show significantly higher odds
of developing an NTE compared with those who were once
disease-free after treatment (Table 4). This finding also highlights
the importance of selecting the most appropriate outcome
variables (Anderson et al., 1983, 2008). Although it may not be
an intuitively surprising observation that patients never made
free of disease are likelier to develop early tumor progression
and die than those rendered free of disease after diagnosis (Bachy
et al., 2010; Schnitt, 2003), the sheer volume of available TCGA
clinical data enabled us to statistically confirm this expectation
with sufficient power even when conditioning on a landmark event
such as end of treatment (here approximated at 3 months).
The relationship of clinical endpoints that may act as surro-
gates for overall survival are of great importance to therapeutic
trials (Chibaudel et al., 2011; Oxnard et al., 2012; Shi and Sar-
gent, 2009). Differences in interpretation (e.g., disease-specific
cause of death, evidence of progression) and accuracy of mea-
surement (e.g., time of event versus time of detection) influence
this decision (Blumenthal et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2003). This
is particularly true for cancers like BRCA and PRAD, in which we
see that OS may not be an appropriate endpoint without suffi-
cient follow-up time. When we compared survival for patients
with high-stage versus low-stage disease, we confirmed a signif-
icantly worse outcome for those with high-stage disease (Fig-
ure S3; Table S1, tab Figure 2EFG_AdditionalInfo) and demon-
strated that their logHRs measured for OS, PFI, and DSS are
strongly and significantly correlated (Figures 2E–2G). This obser-
vation validates the common practice of clinical trials to choose
intermediate endpoints like disease progression or recurrence
events when comparing interventions for less aggressive can-
cers, where overall or disease-specific survival outcomes might
otherwise require decades of follow-up observations.
Previous TCGA studies have reported important clinical
findings of translational significance on interim smaller cohorts.
For example, in the OV marker paper (Cancer Genome Atlas
Research Network, 2011), OS data were used to generate a
193-gene transcriptional signature for survival prediction, and
its predictive power was validated using several other indepen-
dent datasets. In the LGG marker paper (Cancer Genome Atlas
Research
Network,
2015),
analysis
of
OS
showed
that
patients diagnosed with an IDH1 and IDH2 (two very similar
genes, hereafter referred to collectively as IDH) mutation with
or without 1p/19q codeletion had substantially longer OS than
did patients who had wild-type IDH, proving that IDH-1p/19q
status represents a more robust survival predictor than LGG
histologic subtype. Indeed, the clinical and molecular work of
this paper factored into evidence used by the World Health
Organization (WHO) to support their 2016 diagnostic update
for glioma (Louis et al., 2016). Importantly, in this TCGA-CDR,
the number of cases for OV, LGG, and others have significantly
increased and now have longer follow-up times, which provides
greater statistical power for future outcome analyses of these or
other TCGA cancer types.
As for all clinical datasets, using TCGA data for outcome
analyses requires picking relevant endpoints, determining
appropriate statistical methods, and carefully validating models.
In providing this newly curated TCGA-CDR database, we have
considered and wish to point out three important issues that
should be noted by future users of this resource: potential
confounding factors, competing outcome risks (Fine and Gray,
1999), and model assumptions.
Confounding Factors
When confounding factors are present but excluded from the
model, bias can manifest as either over- or underestimation of a
true effect. For example, in breast cancer racial disparity studies,
major gene expression differences have been observed between
black and white patients, but, after adjusting for molecular sub-
types, such differences can be significantly reduced or nullified
(Huo et al., 2017; Keenan et al., 2015). Treatment effects are
also potential confounders (see below) that should be considered
when available and adjusted for appropriately. In certain cases, a
proxy for standard of care, such as age, treating hospital, and year
of diagnosis, can alleviate some of the bias when treatment is
unknown. For modeling decisions in this regard, we encourage
the use of the reporting recommendations for tumor marker prog-
nostic studies (REMARK) (Altman et al., 2012; McShane et al.,
2005). Similar to Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials
(CONSORT) guidelines for reporting randomized clinical trials
(Schulz et al., 2010), REMARK seeks to improve the transparency
and reproducibility of prognostic marker studies.
Competing Outcome Risks
In our determination of DSS, DFI, and PFI endpoints, patients
who died without experiencing the event of interest and were
also disease-free were censored. In this way, we assumed that
if a patient had not died of other causes, then (s)he might have
eventually died of the index cancer. However, there may be sit-
uations in which this assumption is not desirable, such as if we
were to want to estimate the effect of a predictor, say treatment,
on the risk of non-index cancer death, say development of sec-
ondary cancer or cardiovascular disease. We looked for this po-
tential confounding effect of non-index cancer death in our appli-
cation example of cancer stages (Figures 2E–2G) and compared
results across cancer types of three different endpoints but
concluded that, for this example, the effect of competing risk
412
Cell 173, 400–416, April 5, 2018
 was minimal (STAR Methods). However, to enable modeling
of competing risk by future users of this resource, we derived
additional endpoints to indicate non-index death (Table S1, tab
ExtraEndpoints).
Model Assumptions
When applying the Cox proportional hazards (PH) model in
particular, the PH assumption must be examined (Grambsch
and Therneau, 1994). In the disease and outcome examples
we discussed, we emphasize that most of our models satisfied
the Cox PH assumption with only few exceptions, but these
exceptions deserve further exploration to try to discern why
(e.g., aging effects, decreasing influence over time) they violated
the PH assumption so that more accurate estimates of the HRs
can be made.
Despite thorough efforts to clean the data and resolve issues,
there remain important use limitations with these curated data
that must be appreciated by all who access this TCGA clinical
data compendium. First and foremost, because TCGA was
designed primarily for molecular studies, clinical data collection
was secondary, and reporting for a number of data fields was
not required by the program. Initial case selection criteria were
for untreated primary cases with appropriately banked tissues
from multiple institutions, and such cases, thus, do not consti-
tute a consecutive series. In TCGA, TSSs were required to
provide initial clinical information as samples were accrued
and 1 year later additional follow-up clinical information where
possible. For prospectively collected samples, the follow-up
time could be as short as only 1 year. In addition, the follow-up
data were not collected uniformly for each of the different tumor
types/studies. Although there were technical difficulties that pre-
vented some sites from supplying follow-up clinical data, a num-
ber of AWGs were very proactive in working with TSSs and the
BCR to ensure that this follow-up information was as accurate
and up-to-date as possible. Having participants from the TSSs
in these AWGs greatly improved the overall quality of the result-
ing clinical data for these TCGA cancer types. Some rules for
clinical data collection had to be changed over time, which
was unavoidable for a multi-national project that improved its
execution over its 10-year time frame. With additional follow-
up data collection, the value of this TCGA clinical dataset would
grow. Although TCGA funding has ended, we encourage the
development of coordinated efforts to follow up on patients
who were alive at last follow-up.
Following from the above, TCGA-CDR does not contain can-
cer treatment history (for the reasons we provide in the STAR
Methods). Some treatment information is available for 32 of the
33 TCGA cancer types, although this was not TCGA-required
data annotation for samples accruing from each TSS, so not all
cases will be annotated. To complete treatment annotations on
more 11,000 TCGA cancer cases representing 33 different can-
cer types and then to assess the completeness, accuracy, and
outcome effect of these annotated treatment data would require
a major undertaking that is beyond the scope and means of this
current resource curation. There are different therapies for
different cancer types and subtypes, and even within one cancer
type or subtype there are multiple treatment regimens. For these
reasons, we feel that analyzing therapy within the context of a
particular tumor type (and/or subtype) may be more appropriate
than pan-cancer generalizations. When patients were treated
with specific therapies, the benefits of such treatments can be
effectively assessed by endpoints such as DFI and PFI.
A second use limitation of this curated TCGA-CDR is that
TCGA samples were accrued both retrospectively and prospec-
tively, and patients were clinically followed up according to local
clinic schedules that might be disease- and site-specific for the
recording of disease recurrence and patient vital status; thus,
there was no TCGA-specified clinical follow-up plan, given the
program’s primary emphasis on tumor molecular characteriza-
tion. Last, almost all TCGA-acquired tumor samples and, there-
fore, the genomic and molecular data derived from them, come
from single sections of primary tumors in newly diagnosed pa-
tients; the resulting genomic and molecular data do not explicitly
capture any spatial or temporal aspects of tumor heterogeneity
that could potentially represent another patient outcome vari-
able. This limitation, though, is not unique to TCGA but true to
any static primary tumor study.
In summary, this work represents the first ever comprehensive
effort to systematically process TCGA pan-cancer clinical data.
We assembled and integrated all of the acquired clinical data files,
reviewed and carefully analyzed dozens of different data elements
important to cancer research, resolved over 1,000 quality as-
sessed (QA) issues, and generated four commonly used clinical
outcome endpoints for each of the 11,160 tumor cases: OS,
PFI, DFI, and DSS. Using well established and newly developed
analysis methods for each tumor type, we quality-scored all
four
outcome
determinations and
further
provided tumor-
specific recommendations for their use in future studies. We
also show that the resulting TCGA-CDR yields outcome endpoints
consistent with independent non-TCGA study findings for
different tumor types and demonstrate how this resource offers
new opportunities to produce biologically insightful observations
at unprecedented clinical scale. In recognizing the limitations
inherent within the TCGA-CDR and providing critical guidance
and recommendations for its appropriate use, it has become
abundantly clear that future large-scale molecular studies of
human diseases must also systematically collect clinicopatho-
logic, treatment, and outcome event data adhering to the highest
clinical research standards. Its limitations notwithstanding, TCGA-
CDR presents a standardized dataset with a transparent deriva-
tion of four clinical outcome endpoints and resolution of quality
concerns, enabling translational studies at both pan-cancer and
individual disease levels. Adoption of this dataset by future studies
will improve comparability of the results between studies to afford
better interpretation and support reproducibility.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
The TCGA clinical data of 11,160 patients across 33 tumor types were analyzed.
Commonly used clinical data elements were quality assessed (QA), integrated and processed with the help from disease experts and
TCGA Biospecimen Core Resource. Clinical outcome endpoints of overall survival (OS), progression-free interval (PFI), disease-free
interval (DFI), and disease-specific survival (DSS) were derived. Each qualifying end point was subjected to multi-step assessment,
and led to varying endpoint recommendations per tumor type. Validation and Application of the TCGA CDR data were performed by
examples.
METHOD DETAILS
Clinical data
The TCGA clinical data were downloaded from the data portal of Genomic Data Commons (GDC, https://gdc-portal.nci.nih.gov/
legacy-archive/), by selecting ‘‘Biotab’’ as the Data Format, ‘‘Clinical Data’’ as the Data Type, and ‘‘Clinical’’ as the Platform. From
the total of 225 files of TCGA clinical data, 130 initial enrollment and follow-up files were used in this paper. Other files for radiation
or pharmaceutical treatments were not used. Note that all TCGA molecular data are also available from GDC. The same TCGA barcode
structure is used for both clinical data and molecular data, with the first portions of the barcode standing for TSS, patient, and sample
followed by tissue aliquots and other information important for molecular studies. This barcode structure enables integration of
patient-based clinical data with sample-based molecular data.
TCGA network collected tumors from 161 tissue source sites (TSSs) across the world, acquiring tumors from 11,160 patients of
33 different cancer types (see Abbreviations); these tumors were originally diagnosed from 1978 to 2013 with the median diagnosis
year of 2009. With the exception of SKCM (see Results), it was dominantly primary tumors that were included in this pan-cancer
collection. Clinical data collection started in 2007. Each TSS completed the initial enrollment data form when a case passed
pathology and molecular qualification metrics at the BCR. Follow-up data was then provided one year or later after specimen
submission; thus, the follow-up date is generally unique to each case. A prospectively constituted Disease Working Group (DWG)
represented each TCGA cancer type and determined the specific clinical data fields to be collected for study by each AWG. While
these working groups could add unlimited questions to the data forms, they were limited in the number of fields that would be
contractually required by the submitting sites, which was usually around 5-10 fields. For example, the breast cancer DWG prioritized
ER, PR and HER2 status over grade for collection. During this clinical data collection process, the TCGA program made a handful of
site visits to TSSs to ensure that data collection was being completed correctly. During these visits, source documents were reviewed
and compared to the information submitted to TCGA. The BCR also spoke very frequently with TSSs during the years when they were
submitting clinical data. The BCR had internal applications that validated and tracked the data following established QA rules that are
based on logical relationships between data elements. Data fields and individual data entries were later reviewed by each AWG for

 acceptance or censorship from use in the primary TCGA marker paper. Due to these individualized DWG and AWG processes, the
datasets for each of the 33 TCGA studies are unique but there are shared data elements common to all cancer types. Across all TCGA
studies, hundreds of data elements were included in the initial enrollment forms and subsequent follow-up forms.
In this study we did not analyze cancer treatment data but we would like to provide some information about TCGA treatment history
data status here. Treatment data are available for 32 of the 33 cancer types although not for all the cases, because they were not
required data fields when the data were collected. We did not include these data in this TCGA-CDR as we understand that the
treatment history may not be complete and may not show an accurate overview of treatment for the following reasons known to
us: (1) Not all TSSs were where the treatment was performed thus treatment history for patients in those TSSs may not be available;
(2) Prospectively enrolled patients only had updates 1 year after sample collection so treatment information would likely be
incomplete; (3) There is tremendous heterogeneity within treatment data for patients accepted for TCGA studies from all around
the world. We believe that it will be a major undertaking to assess the completeness, accuracy, and value of the treatment data, which
demands the establishment of a different AWG to include oncologists and additional disease domain experts. For example, there are
different therapies for different cancer types and subtypes, and even within one cancer type or subtype there are multiple treatment
regimens. For these reasons we feel that analyzing therapy within the context of a particular tumor type (and/or subtype) may be more
appropriate than pan-cancer generalizations. When patients were treated with specific therapies the benefits of such treatments can
be effectively assessed by endpoints such as DFI and PFI.
Handling of special cases and problems in clinical data files
In processing the clinical data, we encountered over 1000 cases with apparent or real problems.
1) There were 7 Stage 0 cases which seemed to be an error since TCGA studies were focusing on invasive cancers but Stage 0
cancers are in situ. However all of these Stage 0 cases were from the SKCM study, where patients’ clinical data were referring
to the time of diagnosis. For all these Stage 0 cases, it was the subsequently developed distant metastasis tumors that were
used in molecular profiling. Of the 470 tumors used in the SKCM study, only 103 were primary tumors, and 296 were regional
lymph node metastases. The remaining 68 were distant metastases, and those metastatic tumors did not have a matching
primary tumor.
2) There were 483 cases of patients who died ‘‘With Tumor’’ but without a defined ‘‘New NTE,’’ and they were not de novo
Stage IV. This left us unsure whether these patients really died of tumor, and if so were the new tumors new primary tumors
or recurrent tumors of any type. In a previous breast cancer study (Huo et al., 2017) there were 17 such cases, and the authors
decided to exclude them from the breast cancer-free interval endpoint analysis (equivalent to DFI here) after reviewing each of
them by checking into the original clinical database at BCR. For the current study, after a careful vetting we decided to also
exclude these 483 patients from DFI and but included them in OS, PFI and DSS.
3) There were 62 patients who were ‘‘Dead’’ with ‘‘Tumor Free,’’ but there was a defined ‘‘New NTE.’’ This apparent data
inconsistency would affect derivation of DSS but not the other 3 endpoints. This apparent data inconsistency might be
what really had happened, as the patient might have developed a new NTE but then treated again to enter a ‘‘Tumor
Free’’ status, and subsequently died. In this scenario the case should be censored. Equally, there could be an error in vital
status or tumor status, yet we have no evidence which scenario is true. Thus we considered all 62 cases as censored for
DSS. In contrast, the DFI endpoint is defined at the time of the NTE.
4) There were10 patients who were ‘‘Dead’’ with ‘‘Tumor Free,’’ but the exact cancer type was given as ‘‘Cause of Death.’’
Sieving through the BCR records, we found that three patients had no residual tumor (R0) after surgery, but died 66, 113,
and 436 days respectively after diagnosis. Two patients had an ‘‘unknown’’ tumor status in the xml file, but there were notions
that they had progressive diseases. One other patient had additional update 2 years later with tumor status ‘‘unknown’’ but
the information was not updated in the final xml file. For the remaining 4 patients, there was no explanation found. Combining
these additional lines of evidence with the caution we provided before regarding the field of ‘‘Tumor Status,’’ we resolved
these conflicts based on the field of ‘‘Cause of Death,’’ with a caveat that clinically sometimes it is difficult to pinpoint
specifically what causes someone to die and or if a symptom or illness is related to the cancer.
5) There were 797 of the 3346 ‘‘New NTE’’ that did not have a new tumor type specified. In the strict definition of PFI, the
progression should be referring to the progression of the initial primary tumor and thus these cases would have been
excluded. However, during data analysis the PanCanAtlas Pan-Immune AWG decided to adopt a more relaxed definition
of PFI to include any new tumor as an event so these 797 were included in PFI. We assessed that the rate of a positive
response in the ‘‘new primary tumor in other organ’’ field among all 797 new NTEs is very small, thus these 797 cases can
be included in PFI analysis to minimize selection bias.
6) There were 6 cases showing a negative value ranging from �1 to �64 in the field ‘‘last_contact_days_to,’’ suggesting that the
patient was last contacted before diagnosis. There were also 6 cases with an AJCC Stage IV showing a negative value ranging
from �4 to �359 in ‘‘new_tumor_event_dx_days_to,’’ suggesting that their new NTEs were reported before the patient was
diagnosed with cancer. We carefully reviewed the original data, and found different reasons for those negative values but
concluded that the solution to those cases were to set the value of these fields to ‘‘0.’’

 7) There were 46 patients whose ages were 90, and who have equal values in ‘‘birth_days_to.’’ This artificial set of ages is
because of the de-identification requirement specified in Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. Users
need to be cautious that patients shown at an age of 90 are actually 90 years of age or older.
8) Priority of data files: When there is inconstancy between follow-up time from files of different recording dates, should the data
from a later follow-up file take the priority? The answer is no. The recording dates for follow-up forms are administrative only
and may not correlate with patient history. Therefore, we decided that the record with a longer follow-up time would be
preferred when determining event times.
9) There was one patient whose vital status in the enrollment data file was ‘‘Alive’’ with a days_to_last_followup, yet in a follow-up
file the vital status was ‘‘Dead’’ but without ‘‘days_to_death.’’ We choose to use the data in the enrollment data file since the
timing of the subsequent death could not be determined.
10) There was one patient with OV showing a tumor with grade 4. Grade 4 is not a valid value for OV. However since this is the final
data in the TCGA dataset and we have no evidence to support re-grading of the tumor, we left it as grade 4.
Choice of time zero for time-to-event calculations
In TCGA-CDR, we chose the date of diagnosis as time zero for time-to-event calculations for the following reasons. First, TCGA
focused on untreated primary tumors. Of all the 33 cancer types, only SKCM contained a significant portion of the samples that
represented either local or distant metastatic tumors for which there were no matching primary tumors. All other cancer types
had no more than a few metastatic tumors which were all accompanied with matching primary tumors. There were a few tumors
identified after submission as having prior treatment, most were for prior or other malignancies. Based on treatment type TCGA
determined if the case was acceptable or unacceptable for use in molecular studies. Only 42 (0.3%) patients with neoadjuvant
treatment made it into TCGA and were marked with a notification by the TCGA program office.
For any ‘‘primary’’ tumors, the tissue sample was removed from the patient at or close to the time of diagnosis. A field of ‘‘days_to_
sample_procurement’’ is available in the tumor-sample data file for each disease by going to the link of https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/
legacy-archive/search/f to search in the ‘‘File’’ tab using a disease-specific file name, for example for BRCA the search term will be
‘‘nationwidechildrens.org_ssf_tumor_samples_brca.txt.’’ For any other disease the abbreviated disease name will be used in the
place of BRCA in the search term. For metastatic tumors, the values in the field of ‘‘days_to_sample_procurement’’ are relatively large
but for primary tumors, the values in this field are small. For example for BRCA, the mean was 34 days, and the median was 21 days.
Within such a small number of days we do not feel that tumors would have developed so much as to impact the clinical outcomes, and
that using date of diagnosis as time zero would be a good approximation for the date of sample procurement.
Finally, in TCGA data collection, dates were requested which were later processed to derive temporal reference to time zero for
compliance with HIPAA regulations. The date of diagnosis was chosen as time zero by TCGA, because this date was available for
all patients but other dates, for example the date of sample procurement was not. In fact, date of sample procurement was not a
required field. In addition, since dates are protected health information (PHI), some TSSs did not provide exact dates but only the
month and year. For these cases TCGA BCR used the 15th day of the month to represent the date. This best possible solution
introduced a variation from 0 to 16 days for any such date which is in the same range of the days_to_sample_procurement for breast
cancer. Thus, we concluded that date of diagnosis is the preferred choice for time zero in TCGA-CDR, when compared to date of
sampling.
Definitions and derivation of clinical survival outcome endpoints
There are many definitions of clinical outcomes used in oncology research. After assessing all TCGA clinical datasets, four clinical
survival outcome endpoints were chosen for this pan-cancer clinical endpoints analysis: Overall Survival (OS), Progression-Free
Interval (PFI), Disease-Free Interval (DFI), and Disease-Specific Survival (DSS), defined as follows.
OS is the period from the date of diagnosis until the date of death from any cause. The censored time is from date of initial diagnosis
until the date of last contact (largest number of days) from all the clinical data files (including both enrollment and follow-up forms).
With minor exceptions as described in Handling of Special Cases and Problems in Clinical Data Files, derivation of OS outcomes was
not problematic, as there exists minimal ambiguity in the databases about a patient’s status at different time points: alive or dead.
PFI is the period from the date of diagnosis until the date of the first occurrence of a new tumor event (NTE), which includes pro-
gression of the disease, locoregional recurrence, distant metastasis, new primary tumor, or death with tumor. Patients who were alive
without these event types, or died without tumor were censored (Hudis et al., 2007; Website). The event time is the shortest period
from the date of initial diagnosis to the date of an event. The censored time is from the date of initial diagnosis to the date of last con-
tact or the date of death without disease. PFI could be calculated for 31 of the 33 tumors, but not for acute myeloid leukemia (LAML)
and lymphoid neoplasm diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBC). This endpoint is a commonly used surrogate endpoint for a future
death outcome which otherwise takes a longer follow-up time to document and, unlike DFI, described below, it is associated with
less ambiguity in that it is not necessary to first know whether a patient ever achieved disease-free status following their initial diag-
nosis and treatment. Nonetheless, several issues were encountered that needed resolution (c.f. Table S1 Tab TCGA-CDR_Notes).
Among these, we needed to resolve the question of an NTE not clearly specified by tumor type, and to do this we adopted a
more inclusive definition considering all NTEs in our calculation of PFI. However, in Table S1 Tab ExtraEndpoints, we provide two
Cell 173, 400–416.e1–e6, April 5, 2018
e3
 more restrictive definitions of PFI (PFI.1 and PFI.2) so that users can choose the most appropriate PFI parameter for their
research needs.
We would like to point out that the value of ‘‘Progression of Disease’’ was only reported in cancer types of OV, GBM, and UCS, for
34, 256, and 6 cases respectively. The definition of ‘‘Progression of Disease’’ was not as clear as the definitions for other PFI events,
but they generally would be defined by clear radiographic evidence of new or progressive disease. OV and GBM were TCGA pilot
study cancer types and that as the clinical data forms evolved and continued to be improved, the value of ‘‘Progression of Disease’’
was essentially eliminated from the data forms. At the launch of the full-scale TCGA study it had been replaced with more explicit
conditions of new NTEs.
Importantly, in our definition of PFI, ‘‘death with tumor’’ was considered an event whether an NTE was reported or not. There were a
total of 2478 patients who were ‘‘Dead’’ and ‘‘With Tumor.’’ For 1830 patients there was a defined NTE, but for 648 patients there was
no recorded NTE. Since NTE was not a required field, these 648 patients may represent cases where an NTE was not recorded or that
the disease rapidly progressed and the patient died without an NTE diagnosed. Counting the deaths without an NTE as PFI events
would be expected to bias the outcome analysis due to overestimation of event times if the patient had developed an NTE prior to
death but it was not reported to TCGA. To address whether these 648 patients represent under-reported NTEs and should be
excluded from PFI studies we compared their overall survival time to patients who also died with tumor but who had an NTE reported.
Because censored cases are excluded from this comparison and survival times tend to follow a log-normal distribution, we
compared groups using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (Table S2). Of the 31 cancer types that had available data for this analysis,
14 showed a shorter median event time for cases not having an NTE, of which 2 had significantly different survival distribution.
The remaining 17 showed the opposite finding, of which 3 had significantly different survival distributions. Thus, in summary,
only 5 cancer types (COAD, GBM, HNSC, KIRC, SKCM) had a significantly different survival-time distribution between the two groups
of patients, with both over- and under-estimation observed. We therefore accept that there is not evidence for systematic bias by the
assumption that in patients who were reported as dead with tumor be counted as PFI events and we retain these cases in analyses
going forward.
DFI is another commonly used surrogate signifying future cancer mortality in many clinical studies. DFI defined here is the period
from the date of diagnosis (due to the reason given below) until the date of the first new tumor progression event subsequent to the
determination of a patient’s disease-free status after their initial diagnosis and treatment. Such a new event can be either locoregional
recurrence, distant metastasis, development of a new primary tumor in the same organ, or death from advancing of the same
tumor (Hudis et al., 2007; Punt et al., 2007). Patients who developed a new primary tumor in another organ, or were alive without
locoregional recurrence, without distant metastasis or development of another primary tumor in the same organ, or who were
dead and tumor free were censored. The event time is the shortest time from initial diagnosis date to the date of an event. The
censored time is from initial diagnosis date to the last contact date or the date of death.
This outcome endpoint was the most difficult to derive from available TCGA clinical data files in the absence of unspecified cer-
tainty about whether a patient was ever disease-free after their diagnosis. Consequently, 1095 stage IV TCGA patients were excluded
from this endpoint analysis as recommended in other studies (Huo et al., 2017; Keenan et al., 2015) (Table S1 Tab TCGA-CDR), and
given an NA (not applicable) for DFI. For other cases, the data field of ‘‘Tumor Status’’ in the initial enrollment data file could not be
counted on, as it was unclear to us whether the clinical sites completing this field consistently followed a specific time point when the
data form was completed, or if this indication was referring to the fact that the patient was once disease-free after the initial surgery or
after the first course of treatment. We found cases supporting all possible scenarios. In certain cases, the evidence supported the
situation that the patient had more than one-round of disease-free and recurrent cycles. After reviewing all the data elements we
determined that the fields of ‘‘treatment_outcome_first_course,’’ ‘‘residual_tumor,’’ and ‘‘margin_status’’ could be used to arrive
at this determination, and these fields were populated for 29 out of 33 cancer types (Table S4). Disease-free was defined as true,
if the field ‘‘treatment_outcome_first_course’’ is ‘‘Complete Remission/Response,’’ the field ‘‘residual_tumor’’ is R0, or the field
‘‘margin_status’’ is negative. For SARC, the only disease that presented data of both ‘‘margin_status’’ and ‘‘residual_tumor,’’ where
cases having both values were highly consistent, we choose ‘‘residual_tumor’’ to resolve conflicts as there were more cases having
a value for ‘‘residual_tumor’’ than for ‘‘margin_status.’’ Also, in clinical practice the time to assess the ‘‘residual_tumor’’ is when
first course of treatment was done. If the cases were never disease-free, they are given an NA (not applicable) for DFI. Cases of
‘‘dead with tumor’’ but without a new NTE were also excluded (given DFI of NA) as otherwise those cases would artificially prolong
the time of recurrence and bias the results. LAML had only OS data, and SKCM, thymoma (THYM), and uveal melanoma (UVM) didn’t
have any of the information of ‘‘treatment_outcome_first_course,’’ ‘‘residual_tumor,’’ and ‘‘margin_status,’’ and their DFI were not
available. Thus finally we were able to derive DFI for 5,521 cases (1,118 events and 4,403 censored) from 29 of the 33 tumor types
(Table S4; Table S1 Tab TCGA-CDR).
We recognize that for DFI the time interval should start from the time when the patient was first determined to be disease-free, but
such information was not available in the TCGA clinical dataset so we used the time of diagnosis as a surrogate. In statistical analysis
using DFI, we restricted the patient set to those surviving at least 90 days to provide a proxy for the time required for a patient to
complete treatment and be identified as disease free, to avoid immortal-time bias (Anderson et al., 1983; Giobbie-Hurder et al., 2013).
While OS is easy to define, it lacks specificity about cause of death and includes many non-cancer deaths. DSS, on the other hand,
defined here as death from the diagnosed cancer type, has much greater relevance to cancer biology and therapeutic impact. A DSS
event is death from the disease, and the event time is from the date of initial diagnosis until the date of death from the disease. The
e4
Cell 173, 400–416.e1–e6, April 5, 2018
 censored time is from the date of initial diagnosis until the date of last contact or until the date of death from another cause. Within the
TCGA dataset, however, derivation of DSS was complicated since only 6 of the 33 cancer types included a clinical form data field,
‘‘Cause of Death’’ (Table S3). Three of these cancer types, cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma
(CESC), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), and UVM, had relatively high quality data for DSS analysis. Testicular germ cell tumors
(TGCT) and prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) had few DSS and overall deaths. While, stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) had over
50% of death events of unknown cause. For other cancer types, combining the fields of ‘‘tumor_status’’ with ‘‘vital status’’ allowed
us to derive a surrogate for DSS, by approximating ‘‘Dead’’ and ‘‘With Tumor’’ as a DSS event, which in most cases was likely true.
Note that the initial patient enrollment form data entry ‘‘Tumor Status’’ should not be considered as a standardized data field as it
was poorly defined in early versions of the data form. The quality of the information in this field was improved by merging with the
information from the follow-up data files, which yielded a new ‘‘tumor_status’’ field shown in Table S1 Tab TCGA-CDR, which we
considered suitable for use in deriving this endpoint. But, we caution that this surrogate uni-directionally augments the number of
events, as a patient with a tumor who died of other causes (e.g., a car accident or heart attack) would be counted as a DSS event.
Thus our derived DSS only approximates the true DSS.
We would also like to point out that there is another often used endpoint, PFS. The definition of PFS is not standard and often relies
on the clinical study at hand. In our definition of PFI, the events included deaths with tumor, but do not include deaths from other
causes. We hold the opinion that for cancer studies, deaths with tumor are more relevant thus we choose to use our definition
here which we term as PFI to tell its difference from commonly used term of PFS which, in some definitions, contains death from other
causes. For convenience of users who prefer to use this definition of PFS, we included this endpoint in Table S1 Tab ExtraEndpoints.
Assessment of clinical endpoints of OS, PFI, DFI, DSS
Time-to-event studies must have sufficient follow-up to capture enough events and thereby ensure there is sufficient power to
perform appropriate statistical tests (Clark et al., 2003). To test the sufficiency of the follow-up time for each endpoint, three tests
and one supplemental check were applied in a two-step process. In Step 1, testing methods for sufficient follow-up developed
by Maller and Zhou (Maller and Zhou, 1994) (Test 1), and by Shen (Shen, 2000) (Test 2) were used, employing a threshold of
0.05 for calculated statistic as significance. Test 1 is based on the concept that a plot of the K-M empirical distribution function tends
to level off near its right extreme if the follow-up is sufficient. Thus, the step function of K-M should not jump at censored observations,
and it should stay constant or flat on the interval from the largest failure/event time to the largest follow-up time. The magnitude of the
interval is manifested by the information of the censored observations in the interval which is relevant to testing the hypothesis that
the right extreme of failure/event distribution is less than or equal to the right extreme of the censoring distribution. If the observed
value of the interval is ‘‘large,’’ then the hypothesis is accepted so the study has a sufficient follow-up time. Under certain circum-
stances, however, this test may accept a hypothesis with a type I error larger than the nominal value of 0.05. Test 2 adopts the
same concept as Test 1 but improved the control of the type I error. It uses the ratio of the largest follow-up time versus the largest
failure/event time rather than the distance of the interval to perform the test. If the ratio is ‘‘large,’’ then the hypothesis is accepted.
Both tests, however, have the weakness that when applied to rapidly progressing diseases such as GBM, the test results are not
always stable. To address this weakness, we proposed Test 3, requiring an event rate R 30% for all the cases to complement
Test 1 and Test 2.
In Step 2, we developed a Supplemental Check that was composed of three checkpoints: (1) a visual inspection of the cumulative
event plot where the plot should reach a plateau (Figure S2); (2) median event time should be less than median censored time, to
ensure relatively long follow-up time for events to occur but this condition is not necessary for diseases with an event rate > 50%
such as GBM and ovarian cancer (OV); and (3) the number of events should be greater than 20 based on the ‘‘one in ten rule’’ in model
building which means that one predictive variable can be studied for every 10 events (Harrell et al., 1996; Peduzzi et al., 1996). Thus,
to approve an endpoint for use, the data should pass at least one of the 3 tests in Step 1, and pass all the checkpoints in the Step 2,
the Supplemental Check. Data passing at least one of the three tests in Step 1 but failed to pass all three checkpoints in Step 2 yet
had at least 10 events are recommended for use with caution. Otherwise the data are not recommended for use. The endpoints
assessment method is illustrated in the flowchart Figure 1A.
The 4 survival end-points were tested for each of the 33 tumor types. For OS, among the 33 tumors, 7 tumor types passed both
Test 1 and Test 2 in Step 1, which are adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), BLCA, KIRP, rectum adenocarcinoma (READ), SARC, UCEC,
and UVM, and further passed the Supplemental Check in Step 2 except for READ which may need a longer follow-up. 15 tumor types
passed Test 1 (Maller and Zhou 1994), which are BRCA, CESC, COAD, ESCA, KICH, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), LGG,
LUAD, OV, PCPG, PRAD, STAD, thyroid carcinoma (THCA), THYM, and uterine carcinosarcoma (UCS). Given that Test 1 is very con-
servative, we followed the Supplemental Check in Step 2 and confirmed that BRCA, LGG, PCPG, PRAD, and THCA did need a longer
follow-up time to capture more OS events. GBM, HNSC, LUSC, MESO, PAAD, SKCM did not pass Tests 1 and 2 in Step 1, but
passed Test 3, and further passed the Supplemental Check in Step 2, thus these 5 tumor types were approved as having a sufficient
follow-up time for OS. Other diseases that did not pass the tests either needed a longer follow-up time or a larger sample size for more
events. Thus OS of 21 tumor types was recommended for use without reservation, OS of 7 tumor types was recommended for use
with caution, and for the remaining 5 tumor types OS was not an endpoint recommended for use.
For PFI, among the 33 tumors, LAML did not have the data. 19 tumor types passed Tests 1 and 2 in Step 1, which were BRCA,
CESC, cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL), COAD, ESCA, KICH, KIRP, liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), LUAD, OV, PAAD, PRAD,
Cell 173, 400–416.e1–e6, April 5, 2018
e5
 SARC, STAD, TGCT, THCA, THYM, UCEC, and UVM). They further passed the Supplemental Check in Step 2 except for BRCA and
KICH; KICH had 17 events, and BRCA had a median time to event of 26 months and a median time to censor of 25 months. Since
these two median times were so close plus all other conditions were met, we considered the follow-up time for PFI of BRCA as
sufficient. 7 tumor types (DLBC, GBM, HNSC, LGG, LUSC, MESO, READ) passed Test 2, and 2 tumor types (ACC, and UCS) passed
Test 1, and all of them passed the Supplemental Check in Step 2 except DLBC that had 12 events. 3 tumor types (BLCA, KIRC, and
SKCM) did not pass Tests 1 or 2 but passed Test 3, and they further passed the Supplemental Check in Step 2. Thus, LAML did not
have the PFI data; KIRC, DLBC and PCPG were recommended for use with caution, either because the sample size was too small
or that a longer follow-up was needed to capture 20 events, and we also marked CHOL and UCS for use with caution because the
sample sizes were small. The rest of the 27 tumor types were recommended for use without reservation.
The sufficiency of follow-up for DSS was similar to that of OS, and the sufficiency of follow-up for DFI was similar to that of PFI,
except that the numbers of events were smaller.
Competing risk
The assumption of censoring in the above definitions of PFI, DFI, and DSS is that if the patient had not died they would have eventually
experienced the event of interest. For instance, if a patient had not died of a heart attack he would have eventually died of his cancer.
In this example death from a heart-attack is a competing risk for death from cancer. Or similarly, death from a heart attack is a
competing risk for developing progression of cancer. Survival analysis models are available to account for these multiple event types
and should be considered (Fine and Gray, 1999). The effect of a predictor on the outcome of interest may differ by outcome type.
Modeling with competing risks may uncover these differences or reduce biases in the risk estimation from incorrect censoring as-
sumptions. In the CDR a competing risks status variable is created for DSS, DFI, and PFI to assist with these analyses (Table S1
Tab ExtraEndpoints). In these status variables, ‘‘1’’ indicates that the event of interest occurred, ‘‘2’’ indicates that a competing event
occurred, and ‘‘0’’ indicates that the patient did not experience an event during follow-up. For this paper, the influence of competing
risks on the predictors under study was assessed and appeared to be minimal. For the high/low stage comparisons of Figures 2E-2G,
considering this competing risk and found that the logHR was in the same direction, with the same significance, and similar magni-
tude. The difference in the two logHRs was very small and in both directions (Table S1 Tab Figure 2EFG_AdditionalInfo).
In deriving these endpoints, 11 data elements from the main or follow-up clinical data tables were used. We added another field to
indicate whether the case was flagged for redaction based on the TCGA sample annotations.
Other clinical data fields processed
In addition to endpoint-related data fields, we also processed 10 commonly used data fields across cancer types wherever possible
as it would be extremely difficult, inefficient, and beyond the scope of this pan-cancer effort, for us to process all clinical data fields
given the different specific requirements for different cancer types. In these 10 common fields, quality assurance was performed by
checking the data range and the logical relationships between data fields, and by comparison with previously derived data versions
being used by other TCGA AWGs (Huo et al., 2017; Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Cox proportional hazards (PH) regression model was used to calculate the Hazard Ratio (HR), the 95% confidence interval (95%CI),
and p values, with the PH assumption assessed by a test of Schoenfeld residuals. The K-M method was used to create the survival
plots and the log-rank test was used to compare the difference of survival curves. Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for testing the
difference between the distributions of un-censored survival time. Competing risks regression was used to estimate the competing
risk of the endpoints per tumor type. For all tests, a two-tailed p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. In situations of
multiple tests, the false discovery rate (FDR) was calculated using the Benjamini & Hochberg method. All analyses were performed
using R 3.2.2.
DATA AND SOFTWARE AVAILABILITY
The TCGA clinical data were downloaded from the data portal of Genomic Data Commons (GDC, https://gdc-portal.nci.nih.gov/
legacy-archive/). From the total of 225 files of TCGA clinical data, 130 initial enrollment and follow-up files were used, and a total
of 11,160 patients across 33 tumor types were analyzed in this paper. An Integrated TCGA Pan-Cancer Clinical Data Resource
(TCGA-CDR) was created and available in Table S1.

(A–D) OS (A), PFI (B), DFI (C), and DSS (D). Only converge models were shown here.
 Figure S4. K-M Plots of new NTE Development from Patients Who Were Never Disease-Free (Orange) Compared with Those Who Were Once
Disease-Free (Blue), Related to Table 4
Results of 29 cancer types are shown here as for the rest 4 of the 33 cancer types there was no new NTE information. The plot for all cancers combined is shown as
the last figure.
 Figure S5. K-M Plots Comparing the Survival Data from the Top Two TSSs (#1 in Blue and #2 in Orange) with Those from All Other Sites
(Green) for Each Cancer Type, Related to Table 5
(A–D) Plots were made using endpoints of OS (A), PFI (B), DFI (C), and DSS (D). Statistical analysis results for diseases with both top sites supplying at least
50 cases are shown in Table 5.
