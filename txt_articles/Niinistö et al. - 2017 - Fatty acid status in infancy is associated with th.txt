Abstract
Aims/hypothesis We investigated the association of early se-
rum fatty acid composition with the risk of type 1 diabetes-
associated autoimmunity. Our hypothesis was that fatty acid
status during infancy is related to type 1 diabetes-associated
autoimmunity and that long-chain n-3 fatty acids, in particular,
are associated with decreased risk.
Methods We performed a nested case–control analysis within
the Finnish Type 1 Diabetes Prediction and Prevention Study
birth cohort, carrying HLA-conferred susceptibility to type 1
diabetes (n = 7782). Serum total fatty acid composition was
analysed by gas chromatography in 240 infants with islet auto-
immunity and 480 control infants at the age of 3 and 6 months.
Islet autoimmunity was defined as repeated positivity for islet
cell autoantibodies in combination with at least one of three
selected autoantibodies. In addition, a subset of 43 infants with
primary insulin autoimmunity (i.e. those with insulin autoanti-
bodies as the first autoantibody with no concomitant other au-
toantibodies) and a control group (n = 86) were analysed. A
third endpoint was primary GAD autoimmunity defined as
GAD autoantibody appearing as the first antibody without
other concomitant autoantibodies (22 infants with GAD auto-
immunity; 42 infants in control group). Conditional logistic
regression was applied, considering multiple comparisons by
false discovery rate <0.05.
Results Serum fatty acid composition differed between
breastfed and non-breastfed infants, reflecting differences in
the fatty acid composition of the milk. Fatty acids were asso-
ciated with islet autoimmunity (higher serum pentadecanoic,
palmitic, palmitoleic and docosahexaenoic acids decreased
risk; higher arachidonic:docosahexaenoic and n-6:n-3 acid ra-
tios increased risk). Furthermore, fatty acids were associated
with primary insulin autoimmunity, these associations being
stronger (higher palmitoleic acid, cis-vaccenic, arachidonic,
docosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids decreased risk;
higher α-linoleic acid and arachidonic:docosahexaenoic and
n-6:n-3 acid ratios increased risk). Moreover, the quantity of
breast milk consumed per day was inversely associated with
primary insulin autoimmunity, while the quantity of cow’s
milk consumed per day was directly associated.
Conclusions/interpretation Fatty acid status may play a
role in the development of type 1 diabetes-associated

 autoimmunity. Fish-derived fatty acids may be protec-
tive, particularly during infancy. Furthermore, fatty acids
consumed during breastfeeding may provide protection
against type 1 diabetes-associated autoimmunity. Further
studies are warranted to clarify the independent role of
fatty acids in the development of type 1 diabetes.

Introduction
Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease characterised
by the destruction of pancreatic beta cells. Inflammatory
reactions and immunological dysfunction precede the
disease [1, 2], often beginning in infancy or early child-
hood [3]. Fatty acids may play a role in the develop-
ment of type 1 diabetes-associated autoimmunity, as
they have been shown to modulate the immune system
and inflammatory reactions [4, 5]. Furthermore, early
fatty acid status may be important because it can affect
programming and development of an infant’s immune
system, as well as the maturation of the gut, with
long-term consequences [6, 7]. Other lipids could also
play a role. Interestingly, early lipidomic profile was
associated with progression to type 1 diabetes [8].
Long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) in-
take and/or status were protectively related to type 1
diabetes-associated autoimmunity or clinical disease in
several [9–11], but not all [12, 13], epidemiological
studies. Maternal intake and status of fish-derived fatty
acids during pregnancy were not associated with the
risk of developing type 1 diabetes in the offspring [9,
14, 15], with the exception of one case–control study
reporting a protective association [16]. Saturated fatty
acids (SFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs)
have also been associated with the risk of type 1
diabetes-associated autoimmunity. In the Finnish type
1 diabetes prediction and prevention (DIPP) study,
high serum levels of cow’s milk-derived fatty acids
were associated with a higher risk of islet autoimmu-
nity [12]. This is in line with the observed association
between milk fat consumption and increased risk of
islet autoimmunity [17].
During early infancy, breast milk and infant formulas
are the main dietary sources of fatty acids and therefore
the type of milk feeding is likely the most important de-
terminant of fatty acid status. Breastfeeding, measured as
breastfeeding duration, was not found to be associated
with the risk of islet autoimmunity or type 1 diabetes in
cohort studies [17–20]. Looking at the other side of the
coin, cow’s milk consumption (measured as the quantity
consumed) during infancy and childhood was related to
increased risk of islet autoimmunity and/or type 1 diabetes
in several prospective cohort series [17, 21–24]. The cause
is unknown and several components in milk may be in-
volved [25–27].
Our hypothesis was that fatty acid status during infancy is
related to type 1 diabetes-associated autoimmunity and that, in
particular, high levels of long-chain n-3 PUFAs are associated
with decreased risk.
Methods
Study design The study was carried out in a nested case–
control design within the Finnish DIPP Nutrition Study
and included children at increased genetic risk for type
1 diabetes (n = 7782). Increased genetic risk was deter-
mined by the presence in cord blood of a high-risk
genotype (HLA-DQB1*02:*0302) or a moderate-risk ge-
notype (HLA-DQB1*0302:x, where x = other than *02,
*0301 or *0602). Children were recruited during the
years 1997 and 2004. Informed consent was obtained
from the families. DIPP children are monitored for islet
autoimmunity and their blood samples are collected by
venepuncture at the ages of 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and
24 months and subsequently at 12 month intervals up
to the age of 15 years. Ethical approval for this study
was obtained from the local ethics committees.
For the nested case–control design, all cases of islet auto-
immunity and of type 1 diabetes without preceding islet auto-
immunity were identified at the end of the follow-up period

 (Fig. 1). The participants were monitored for the appearance
of markers for islet autoimmunity and clinical type 1
diabetes. Islet cell autoantibodies (ICA) were used as
the primary screening tool for beta cell autoimmunity.
When a child seroconverted to positivity for ICA for the
first time, all that child’s preceding and subsequent sam-
ples were analysed for insulin autoantibodies (IAA), au-
toantibodies to 65 kDa isoform of GAD (GADA) and
antibodies to tyrosine phosphatase-related islet antigen 2
(IA-2A) and at this point the follow-up interval was
shortened to 3 months.
Autoantibody assays ICA were quantified by a standard in-
direct immunofluorescence method on sections of frozen hu-
man pancreas from a blood group O donor [28]. IAA were
quantified by microassay [29, 30] and GADA and IA-2Awere
analysed using specific radiobinding assays [31–33]. Details
of the autoantibody methods are described by Kimpimäki et al
[34].
Definition of outcomes Islet autoimmunity was defined as
repeated positivity for ICA in combination with at least one
of the biochemical autoantibodies analysed (IAA, GADA or
IA-2A), or the presence of clinical type 1 diabetes. The medi-
an age of islet autoimmunity endpoint was 3.0 years (range
0.5–9.2). The diagnosis of diabetes was based on the WHO
criteria. As a second endpoint within our islet autoimmunity
case children, we used primary insulin autoimmunity, defined
as IAA appearing as the first antibody without any other con-
comitant autoantibodies. The median age of primary insulin
autoimmunity was 1.0 years (range 0.2–4.2). As a third end-
point, we used primary GAD autoimmunity in children with
islet autoimmunity. Primary GAD autoimmunity was defined
as GADA appearing as the first antibody without other
concomitant autoantibodies. The median age of primary
GAD autoimmunity was 2.0 years (range 0.2–7.1).
Distributions of seroconversion age for islet autoimmunity,
primary insulin autoimmunity and GAD autoimmunity are
presented in Table 1.
Selection of controls Matching criteria for the control chil-
dren were the same sex, HLA-conferred DQB1 risk group
(moderate or high risk), delivery hospital, the date of birth
within 3 months in relation to the case children and not being
from the same family as the case children. From all potential
control children, two seronegative children were randomly
selected at the age point at which the respective case child
turned out to have islet autoimmunity or type 1 diabetes. For
the random selection, one child could serve as a control for
more than one case and could subsequently become a case.
Thirty-one children served as control for two or more case
children and ten of the control children later became a case.
Finally, the total fatty acid composition was analysed in 240
children with islet autoimmunity or type 1 diabetes and 480
matched seronegative control children from the 3 and 6 month
serum samples (Table 2).
Measurement of serum fatty acid status Serum fatty acid
proportions were determined by using a gas chromatographic
method (Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA, USA) as described
earlier [12]. Each case–control set was analysed in the same
batch. Laboratory staff were blinded for case–control status.
Assessment of the child’s diet Dietary information was ob-
tained at the age of 3 and 6 months by a 3 day food record
(including two weekdays and one weekend day [17]) and a
dietary questionnaire in which families recorded the infant’s
age at introduction of new foods and breastfeeding. Infant

 feeding pattern, including feeding in the delivery hospital, was
also established by interview during the clinical visits (3, 6, 9,
12 months). Families were given oral and written instructions
by trained research nurses in how to fill in the food records,
day care personnel were provided with written instructions
and the records were checked by trained research nurses at
the clinical visit [17].
Our definition of exclusive breastfeeding was that breast
milk was the only drink or food to which the infant was ex-
posed, except for water and dietary supplementation (not con-
taining energy). The composition of breast milk was taken
from the Finnish national food composition database
(FINELI) which was updated based on Finnish breast milk
samples collected during the years 2011–2012 from 40 wom-
en whose children were 1–6 months of age. Fatty acid com-
position of infant formula was based on data reported by the
manufacturers.
Calculation of the quantity of breast milk consumed The
quantity of breast milk consumed was calculated using esti-
mated energy requirements and growth [35]. The length and
weight of the children were measured every 3 months during
the first year of life at the study centre visits. Energy need was
estimated based on energy requirements for weight and age,
plus the estimated amount of incremental energy needed to
support tissue accretion (energy deposition) [35]. Estimated
energy requirement equalled total energy requirement plus
energy deposition. Estimated energy from breast milk
equalled estimated energy requirement minus energy intake
from food records. Based on this, the quantity of breast milk
consumed per day was calculated.
Statistical analyses Background characteristics of children
comprising cases and their controls were compared using condi-
tional logistic regression analysis. This accounts for the matching
of cases and controls and is the standard method of estimation in
nested case–control study designs. To analyse the serum fatty
acid status in breastfed and non-breastfed infants, they were
categorised according to their breastfeeding status at the age of
3 months: (1) exclusively breastfed; (2) breastfed, but not exclu-
sively breastfed and (3) non-breastfed. At the age of 6 months we
used only two categories for breastfeeding: (1) breastfed and (2)
non-breastfed. This was because there were only six children
who were exclusively breastfed at that age. The differences in
serum status between breastfeeding categories were tested using
mixed linear model with matched sets used as random effects.
To assess the associations between serum fatty acid propor-
tions and islet autoimmunity, primary insulin autoimmunity or
primary GAD autoimmunity, conditional logistic regression
was applied. To account for potential confounders, we includ-
ed cow’s milk consumption, familial diabetes and maternal
vocational education in the multiple conditional likelihood
logistic regression models. We used cow’s milk consumption
as an adjusting factor because it is a more accurate variable
(measured by food records) than breastmilk consumption (es-
timate based on growth). The quantity of cow’s milk and
breast milk consumed cannot be included as adjusting factors
in the same model because of their strong correlation.
Children with missing confounder data were excluded from
the adjusted analysis. Multiple testing was addressed by using
a p value adjustment method that controls the false discovery
rate (FDR) [36].We considered FDR <0.05 to be significant.

 endpoints were studied by adding an interaction term to the
conditional logistic regression model. We reported results
from the interaction models if there was an indication of an
interaction (FDR <0.05). Spearman’s correlations between se-
rum fatty acids and milk feeding were also calculated.
Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Background variables and the risk of islet autoimmunity
Familial type 1 diabetes was associated with an increased risk
of islet autoimmunity, while maternal vocational education
was associated with a decreased risk (Table 2).
Serum fatty acid status in relation to breastfeeding status
Serum fatty acid status differed between breastfed and non-
breastfed infants at the ages of 3 months and 6 months, reflecting
differences in fatty acid composition of breast milk and infant
formulas (Table 3). Breastfed infants had higher serum levels of
myristic, stearic, conjugated linoleic (CLA), palmitoleic, cis-
vaccenic, dihomo-γ-linolenic (GLA), arachidonic (AA),
eicosapentaenoic (EPA), docosapentaenoic (DPA) and
docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids, compared with non-breastfed in-
fants, at 3 and 6 months of age. Breastfed infants had lower

 serum levels of oleic, linoleic (LA) and GLA compared with
non-breastfed infants. In addition, at the age of 3 months, the
breastfed infants had a higher serum level of pentadecanoic acid
compared with non-breastfed infants. At 6 months of age,
breastfed infants had a lower serum level of α-linolenic acid
(ALA) (Table 3). The ratios of n-6:n-3 fatty acids and
AA:DHA in serum at 3 and 6 months were lower in breastfed
infants than in non-breastfed infants (Table 3). These results are
in line with lower contents of oleic acid, LA and ALA and higher
content of myristic, pentadecanoic, stearic, palmitoleic, cis-
vaccenic and dihomo-GLA and CLA, AA, EPA, DPA and
DHA in breast milk than in infant formula (Table 3).
Fatty acids that were present at higher proportions in
serum of breastfed infants and present at comparatively
high proportions in breast milk correlated directly with
the amount of breast milk consumed, and inversely with
the amount of cow’s milk consumed, by control chil-
dren at the age of 3 and/or 6 months (electronic sup-
plementary material [ESM] Table 1). Respectively, fatty
acids present at higher proportions in serum of non-
breastfed infants, consumed in comparatively higher
amounts in cow’s milk, correlated directly with the
amounts of cow’s milk consumed and inversely with
the amount of breast milk consumed (ESM Table 1).

 Serum fatty acid status, type of milk feeding and the risk
of islet autoimmunity Higher serum levels of palmitic
and palmitoleic acid (16:1n-9) at the age of 3 months,
as well as pentadecanoic acid at the age of 6 months,
were associated with a decreased risk of islet autoimmu-
nity (Table 4). On the other hand, serum AA:DHA ratio
at the age of 3 months and serum n-6:n-3 ratio at the
age of 6 months was associated with an increased risk
of islet autoimmunity. Breastfeeding status modified the
associations between serum DHA and the risk of islet
autoimmunity at the age of 3 months (p = 0.003,
FDR = 0.024). The proportion of DHA in the serum
was associated with a decreased risk of islet autoimmu-
nity only in non-breastfed children (Table 4).
Serum fatty acid status, milk feeding and the risk of pri-
mary insulin autoimmunity The proportions of palmitoleic
acid, cis-vaccenic acid, AA, DPA and DHAwere inversely asso-
ciated with primary insulin autoimmunity at the age of 3 and/or
6 months (Table 5). ALA and high ratios of AA:DHA and n-6:n-
3 were associated with increased risk. Higher breast milk con-
sumption was associated with a decreased risk of primary insulin
autoimmunity, whereas cow’s milk consumption was associated
with an increased risk.
Serum fatty acid status, milk feeding and the risk of primary
GAD autoimmunity After multiple testing, fatty acid status in
infancy was not associated with GAD autoimmunity (ESM

 Adjustments for background factors and milk feeding
Adjusting conditional logistic regression models for familial
diabetes and maternal education did not change the results
(data not shown). Adjusting for cow’s milk consumption did
not change the association between fatty acids and islet auto-
immunity substantially (ESM Fig. 1). Although this adjust-
ment diluted the associations between SFAs and MUFAs
and primary insulin autoimmunity, the associations between
fish-derived fatty acids and primary insulin autoimmunity
remained essentially unchanged (ESM Fig. 1). After correc-
tion for multiple testing, the results were non-significant (FDR
<0.05).
Discussion
Main findings Fatty acid status in infancy was related to type
1 diabetes-associated autoimmunity. Fish-derived fatty acids
in particular appeared to be protective. In addition, fatty acids
found in breast milk were protectively associated with islet
autoimmunity and primary insulin autoimmunity. Generally,
associations were stronger for primary insulin autoimmunity,
the earliest endpoint investigated, compared with later.
Strengths Our study used a nested case–control design within
a well-defined prospective birth cohort and had a compara-
tively large number of islet autoimmunity endpoints.
Furthermore, established and well-functioning biomarkers
were used; an earlier validation study from DIPP, comparing
food consumption data with serum fatty acid composition,
showed that fatty acid proportions in non-fasting, whole se-
rum are suitable biomarkers in young children [37].
Importantly, the current study was performed at a time when
DHA was not yet added to infant formulas in Finland and
therefore its intake was low in formula-fed infants. This cre-
ated a relatively large contrast in exposure, which is an advan-
tage. Moreover, we investigated dietary factors in infancy and
it is important to note that estimation of an infant’s diet is
comparatively easy and accurate because it is less variable
than that of an older child.
Limitations Fatty acids found in the peripheral circulation of
infants originate from infant and maternal diets and adipose
tissue storage, as well as metabolic processes, some of which
are affected by genetic factors [38, 39]. It can be considered a
limitation that it was not possible to account for genetic factors
involved in fatty acid metabolism. Furthermore, the study in-
cluded a relatively low number of cases with primary insulin
autoimmunity (n = 43) and primary GAD autoimmunity
(n = 22) compared with the islet autoimmunity endpoint
(n = 240). Thus, the statistical power may have been insuffi-
cient to show statistically significant associations between
fatty acid proportions and the primary GAD endpoint, partic-
ularly, after multiple testing (FDR <0.05).
n-3 PUFAs and risk of type 1 diabetes-associated autoim-
munity Fish-derived fatty acids DHA and DPA were associ-
ated with decreased risk of primary insulin autoimmunity. For
islet autoimmunity, a protective association was observed in
non-breastfed infants at 3 months of age. Overall, these results
suggest that long-chain n-3 PUFAs are protective during in-
fancy. We reported earlier that long-chain n-3 PUFA propor-
tions were not associated with islet autoimmunity in older
children (1–6 years of age) in the DIPP cohort [12].
Altogether, the results indicate that long-chain n-3 PUFA sta-
tus during the early months, a time when the immune system
is maturing and being programmed, is critical.
Interestingly, a very strong association was found between
DHA and decreased risk of islet autoimmunity in non-
breastfed infants. These infants had the lowest levels of
long-chain n-3 PUFAs because very few consumed fish and
DHAwas not present in formula at that time. This indicates an
independent role for long-chain n-3 fatty acids in the develop-
ment of type 1 diabetes-associated autoimmunity. It should be
noted that this result is not confounded by breastfeeding.
Only 19% of the infants in the DIPP cohort had eaten fish by
the age of 6 months and therefore the source of EPA, DPA and
DHA was maternal diet (during pregnancy or lactation) or en-
dogenous synthesis from their precursor ALA. ALA per se was
associated with increased risk of primary insulin autoimmunity,
which is in line with our earlier observation that maternal con-
sumption of vegetable oils during lactation was associated with
increased risk of islet autoimmunity in this cohort [40]. ALA in
the maternal diet comes mainly from vegetable oils; in 3-month-
old infants it is obtained from breast milk and formula. The ratios
of n-6:n-3 and AA:DHA were associated with increased risk of
islet autoimmunity and primary insulin autoimmunity. This may
reflect the beneficial effect of long-chain n-3 fatty acids.
Our results concerning long-chain n-3 PUFAs are in
line with the findings of a Norwegian case–control study
suggesting that the use of cod liver oil (rich in EPA and
DHA) during the first year of life protects against type 1
diabetes [9]. Furthermore, the prospective Diabetes
Autoimmunity Study in the Young (DAISY), investigat-
ing older children (9 months to 8 years of age), found that
high dietary intake and erythrocyte membrane content of
n-3 PUFAs were associated with a decreased risk of islet
autoimmunity (defined as repeated positivity for at least
one autoantibody) [10, 11], but not with progression to
type 1 diabetes [13]. Results from DAISY as well as the
DIPP cohort support the view that early stages of autoim-
munity are affected by long-chain n-3 PUFAs.
Fatty acids related to breast milk and risk of type 1
diabetes-associated autoimmunity Fatty acids present in
1230

 higher quantities in breast milk, as well as serum of
breastfed infants (pentadecanoic, palmitic, palmitoleic and
cis-vaccenic acids and AA, DPA and DHA), were associated
with decreased risk of islet autoimmunity or primary insu-
lin autoimmunity, or both. Furthermore, the quantity of
breast milk consumed was associated with decreased
risk of primary insulin autoimmunity. The findings sup-
port the view that breastfeeding or some components of
breast milk, including fatty acids, are protective, partic-
ularly against early autoimmunity. As far as we know,
our study is the first one investigating the amount of
breast milk consumed in this context, and having pri-
mary insulin and GAD autoimmunity as outcomes.
Earlier findings on the associations between duration
of breastfeeding and risk of developing type 1 diabetes
are inconsistent. Most prospective cohort studies do not show
any association between breastfeeding duration and the risk
of islet autoimmunity or type 1 diabetes [18–20] apart
from a Swedish study that reported a protective associ-
ation with islet autoimmunity [23] and a Norwegian
study that reported a protective association for progres-
sion from islet autoimmunity to type 1 diabetes [41].
In our study, the quantity of cow’s milk consumed was
associated with an increased risk of primary insulin autoim-
munity. Our findings are in line with previous prospective
cohort studies on milk consumption during infancy and child-
hood and the development of islet autoimmunity and/or type 1
diabetes [17, 21–24].

 Cow’s milk as adjusting factor To investigate whether fatty
acids are independently associated with type 1 diabetes auto-
immunity, and not merely a reflection of the type of milk
consumed, we adjusted the statistical models for the amount
of cow’s milk consumed. This did not substantially change
results, suggesting that fatty acid status is indeed independent-
ly associated with islet autoimmunity. For primary insulin
autoimmunity, as expected, most of the associations were di-
luted, because of the strong association between milk type and
primary insulin autoimmunity (applied to SFA, MUFA, ratios
of AA:DHA and n-6:n-3).
Differences between endpoints We observed stronger asso-
ciations for primary insulin autoimmunity, the earliest end-
point investigated, compared with the later endpoints (islet
autoimmunity and primary GAD). First, the explanation for
why different associations are seen for different endpoints
may be that their development differs by genotype and there-
fore the pathogenic processes may be different [42]. Second,
measurements of fatty acid status and primary insulin autoim-
munity are carried out within a short period and therefore there
may be less confounding. It is possible that a protective asso-
ciation is more difficult to demonstrate at a later age, because
the diet becomes more variable.
Conclusions Our results show that fatty acid status in infants
strongly reflects the type of milk feeding. Higher proportions
of fish-derived fatty acids as well as fatty acids related to
breastfeeding may provide protection from type 1 diabetes-
associated autoimmunity. Furthermore, breast milk consump-
tion may reduce, and cow’s milk consumption may increase,
the risk of primary insulin autoimmunity. This study clarifies
the complex associations between fatty acid status, milk type
and type 1 diabetes development, but further studies on the
subject are warranted.
