Background-—The incidence rates of ischemic stroke and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have decreased
significantly in the United States since 1950. However, there is evidence of flattening of this trend or increasing rates for stroke in
patients younger than 50 years. The objective of this study was to examine the changes in incidence rates of stroke and STEMI
using an age-period-cohort model with statewide data from New Jersey.
Methods and Results-—We obtained stroke and STEMI data for the years 1995–2014 from the Myocardial Infarction Data Acquisition
System, a database of hospital discharges in New Jersey. Rates by age for the time periods 1994–1999, 2000–2004, 2005–2009, and
2010–2014 were obtained using census estimates as denominators for each age group and period. The rate of stroke more than
doubled in patients aged 35 to 39 years from 1995–1999 to 2010–2014 (rate ratio [RR], 2.47; 95% CI, 2.07–2.96 [P<0.0001]). We
also found increased rates of stroke in those aged 40 to 44, 45 to 49, and 50 to 54 years. Strokes rates in those older than 55 years
decreased during these time periods. Those born from 1945–1954 had lower age-adjusted rates of stroke than those born both in the
prior 20 years and in the following 20 years. STEMI rates, in contrast, decreased in all age groups and in each successive birth cohort.
Conclusions-—There appears to be a significant birth cohort effect in the risk of stroke, where patients born from 1945–1954 have
lower age-adjusted rates of stroke compared with those born in earlier and later years. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2016;5:e004245 doi:

Key Words: epidemiology • ischemic stroke • myocardial infarction
T
he rates of ischemic stroke and ST-segment elevation
myocardial infarction (STEMI) have decreased substan-
tially since 1950. The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) estimates that from 1950 to 1999, deaths
from myocardial infarction (MI) decreased by 56% and deaths
from stroke by 70%.1 Fang and colleagues2 found nearly a
50% decrease in the incidence of stroke in the United States
from 1988 to 2008. In the Atherosclerosis Risk in Commu-
nities (ARIC) study, the rate of MI decreased by 4.7% per year
in patients without a history of MI.3 The Kaiser Permanente
Northern California Health Care System found a 24% decrease
in MI incidence between 2000 and 2008.4 Similar decreases
in incidence were seen in many countries including a nearly
50% decline in MI in Denmark between 1984 and 2008,5 a
74% decrease in MI in the Whitehall II study from the United
Kingdom,6 and a greater than 60% decrease in MI in Zagreb,
Croatia, from 1979 to 2001.7 In Canada, the rate of hospital
admissions for stroke decreased by 27% between 1995 and
2004.8 In a study from the Joinville community in Brazil, the
rate of stroke declined by 27%.9 The CDC has attributed the
declines to primary preventive efforts including reductions in
smoking, blood pressure, and blood cholesterol.
There have been, however, several reports that the
decreasing trends in stroke and MI are now abating or
potentially reversing. Lee et al10 reported increases in MI
during the early years of the 21st century in Taiwan. As early
as the 1980s, there were reports of a slowing of the decline in
stroke rates in the United States.11 Kissela and colleagues12
found a decreasing trend of ischemic stroke incidence in
patients aged 55 years and older but an increasing trend in
those younger than 55. Similar results were found in Dijon,
France, in young men.13 Recent studies have shown similar
increases in stroke hospitalizations in young adults the United
States and Denmark.14,15

 Age-period-cohort (APC) analyses have been used to study
changes in trends of these variables over time. The age
component provides insight into the effect of physiological
changes over time due to aging. The period component allows
for an understanding of how secular changes over time affect
outcomes. These could include improvements in healthcare
over time that may have population-wide effects during the
period under study. The birth cohort component provides
information on the effect of early-life influences on outcomes.
Individuals in a birth cohort share similar life course
experiences, ie, period effects occur at the same age for
individuals within the birth cohort.
The objective of this study was to use APC analyses to
examine differences in the incidence rates of ischemic stroke
and STEMI in New Jersey during the past 20 years. Using this
methodology, we attempted to unravel the separate effects
due to aging, secular changes, and life course experiences on
these outcomes.
Materials and Methods
We obtained data from the Myocardial Infarction Data
Acquisition System (MIDAS) for the years 1995–2014. MIDAS
is an administrative database containing hospital records of
all patients discharged from nonfederal hospitals in New
Jersey with a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease or an
invasive cardiovascular procedure.16 Information from death
certificates was linked to the hospitalization records. The data
were obtained from the New Jersey Department of Health
utilizing the New Jersey Discharge Data Collection System
(NJDDCS) and the New Jersey state and Rutgers Robert Wood
Johnson Medical School institutional review boards approved
the study and waived all patient consent requirements.
We identified all hospitalizations for ischemic strokes
utilizing International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision,
Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) primary discharge diagnostic
codes of 433.NN-434.NN. STEMIs were identified by an ICD-9-
CM code of 410.NN while excluding those with codes of
410.7N, indicating a non-STEMI, and 410.N2, indicating a prior
MI. Primary discharge diagnosis codes were used to increase
the specificity that the hospitalizations were for incident stroke
or STEMI. Secondary diagnosis codes for strokes have been
shown to overestimate stroke counts by including prior
events.17 The denominators for the incidence rates were
determined for each sex, year of birth, and incident year utilizing
New Jersey midyear census and intercensal estimates.18
Statistical Analysis
In our primary analysis, we calculated incidence rates for ten
5-year age groups: 35 to 39, 40 to 44, 45 to 49, 50 to 54, 55
to 59, 60 to 64, 65 to 69, 70 to 74, 75 to 79, and 80 to 84
years. We divided the data into four 5-year time periods:
1995–1999, 2000–2004, 2005–2009, and 2010–2014. We
measured incidence rates as a function of age, period, and
birth cohort and developed 4 models based on prior work
using APC methods.19–21 The models estimated incidence
rates by Poisson regression using generalized estimating
equations (GEE). The use of GEE corrects for possible
overdispersion of the Poisson estimates.22 The first model,
the parsimonious model, used age as the sole covariate and
took the form: ci=l+ai+ei where l is the mean count, ai is the
effect of the age group i, and ei the random error term. We
then tested more complex nested models and compared
model goodness-of-fit from the parsimonious model. The
second model included the period as an integer value with
values 1, 2, 3, or 4 and took the form cij=l+ai+b9j+eij where
j is the time period. The third model included the period as a
categorical value and took the form: cij=l+ai+bj+eij where b
is the effect of period j. The fourth model added the
interaction term for age and period and took the form:
cij=l+ai+bj+ai9bj+eij. Based on the relationship between the
age9period interaction and the birth cohort, the interaction
term closely approximates the effect of the birth cohort. We
compared the quasi-Akaike Information Criterion (QIC) for
each model to test goodness-of-fit for variable selection.23
In a second analysis, we utilized five 10-year birth cohorts,
those born between 1925–1934, 1935–1944, 1945–1954,
1955–1964, and 1954–1974, and who were aged 45 to
65 years. These birth cohorts and age groups were chosen as
they had significant overlap by age where data were available
in our data set allowing for intercohort comparisons. We
compared birth cohorts while adjusting for age using a model
that included the birth cohort as a categorical variable and
age as a continuous variable.
Results
APC Analysis of Ischemic Stroke and STEMI
Incidence Rates
The rates of ischemic stroke and STEMI by time period and
age groups are shown in Table 1. Overall, the rate of stroke
for those aged 35 to 84 years decreased from 314.1 strokes
per 100 000 person-years (PY) during 1995–1999 to 271.0
per 100 000 PY during 2010–2014. The decrease in STEMI
was much larger, decreasing by more than 60% from 206.4 to
84.7 STEMIs per 100 000 PY from 1995–1999 to 2010–
2014.
Using QIC, we found that the fourth model, which included
the age9period interaction term, was a better fit than either
the parsimonious model (age only) or the second model (age
plus period). We used this model to determine changes in
rates by time periods (see Table 2 for model comparisons).

 Table 3 and Figure 1 present data on birth cohorts for
stroke and STEMI. For the youngest 3 age groups (35–39, 40–
44, and 45–49 years) there were significant increases in the
rate of stroke in the last 2 periods of the study, 2005–2009
and 2010–2014, as compared with the first period, 1995–
1999. For example, in the 35- to 39-year age group, the rate
of stroke increased from 9.5 strokes per 100 000 PY in
1995–1999 to 23.6 strokes per 100 000 PY (rate ratio [RR],
2.47; 95% CI, 2.07–2.96 [P<0.0001]). The rates of stroke
increase in these age groups were similar in both men and
women (data not shown). In contrast, we found declining rates
of stroke in the oldest 6 age groups ranging from 55 to
84 years. We found a 22% decrease in the rate of stroke in
those 80 to 84 years between 1995–1999 and 2010–2014
(RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.74–0.83 [P<0.0001]). The rate of STEMI
in the 35- to 39-year age group decreased from 21.0 to 13.6
per 100 000 PY from 1995–1999 to 2010–2014 (RR, 0.65;
95% CI, 0.50–0.83 [P=0.001]). These corresponded with
similar, although larger, decreases in STEMI for those aged 80
to 84 years, for whom there was a 71% decrease during these
time periods (RR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.27–0.32 [P<0.0001]).
There appeared to be a transition of stroke rates at ages
50 to 54 years. The rate of stroke in those 50 to 54 years
decreased significantly between 1995–1999 and 2000–2004
(RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74–0.96 [P=0.01] and showed no
significant difference between 1995–1999 and 2004–2008
and a small increase between 1995–1999 and 2010–2014.
Those aged 50 to 54 years during 2000–2004 were born
between 1946 and 1954. This same cohort was 55 to 59
years during 2005–2009 and 60 to 64 years during 2010–
2014. The rate of stroke for this cohort was lower than the
reference cohort (born 10 years earlier) when this group was
55 to 59 years (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.72–0.91 [P=0.0004],
compared with 1995–1999) and 60 to 64 (RR, 0.78; 95% CI,
0.70–0.87 [P<0.0001], compared with 1995–1999). This
distinct cohort effect did not appear in the STEMI data, where
the rates declined in all age groups in the second and third
time period and showed little or no change between the third
and fourth time period.
Birth Cohort Analysis of Stroke and STEMI
Incidence Rates
In our second analysis, we examined the birth cohort effect.
We limited the ages examined in this model to ages 45 to 65
years since each of the 10-year birth cohorts provided data
for these ages during the study period. Those born between
1945 and 1954 (designated as the reference birth cohort) had
lower rates of stroke compared with the two prior birth
cohorts (those born between 1925–1934 or 1935–1944) and
with the two birth cohorts that followed (those born between
1955–1964 or 1965–1974) (Table 4). Those born in the
earliest examined birth cohort, 1925–1934, had a 26% higher
rate of stroke after adjusting for age compared with those
born in 1945–1954 (adjusted RR [ARR], 1.26; 95% CI, 1.15–

Discussion
In this APC analysis of incident rates of ischemic stroke and
STEMI in New Jersey, we found that there was a concerning
upward trend in the rate of stroke for those in the 3 youngest
age groups, those from age 35 to 49 years. There also
appeared to be an age group, 50 to 54 years, where there
were relatively modest changes in the rate of stroke
throughout the 20 years. The downward trend in the oldest

 age groups, the flattening trend in the middle age groups, and
the upward trend in the youngest age groups suggest a birth
cohort effect. In a direct analysis of birth cohorts, we found
that those born from 1945 to 1954 had a significantly lower
risk of stroke compared with earlier and later cohorts after
adjusting for age; an effect that was not evident for STEMI
(Figure 2). This finding seems to indicate a possible transition
in birth cohort effects on stroke risk.
Other research has suggested similar trends in stroke risk.
Khellaf et al, examining data from Dijon, France, from 1985–
2005 and using APC analysis, found that men aged 18 to 59
years had an increased risk for stroke between 1992–1998
and 1999–2005.13 They did not find a similar effect in
women. Kissela et al found increases in stroke rates in both
white and black patients aged 20 to 54 years between 1993
and 2005.12 The results from our study provide additional
evidence for the trend of increasing rates of stroke in patients
50 years and younger.
We found evidence that those born between 1945 and
1954 had significantly lower rates of stroke after age
adjustment. Compared with the earlier birth cohorts, the
1945–1954 cohort had lower prevalence of obesity and
smoking.24,25 They also benefited from the availability of lipid-
lowering drugs such as statins and antihypertensive agents
such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors earlier in
their lifetimes than prior cohorts.26,27 While this cohort had a
higher prevalence of diabetes than its predecessors, these
had not yet reached the epidemic proportions found in later

 cohorts.28 The 1945–1954 birth cohort also likely benefited
from the widespread improvement in the understanding of
and treatment for risks related to all cardiovascular disease.
We also found evidence that those born after 1954 had
higher rates of stroke compared with the 1945–1954 birth
cohort. In these later cohorts, there was a reversal in the
trend toward lower prevalence of obesity as well as a much
steeper increase in the prevalence of diabetes.24,28 It has also
been shown that, in spite of advanced treatment options,
control of blood pressure and plasma lipids is lower in the
younger age groups during the time period of this study.29–32
Medication adherence has been shown to be lower in those
without health insurance,33 and the younger birth cohorts
were less likely to have health insurance than those born
earlier.34 Atrial fibrillation, a leading risk factor for stroke, has
also been steadily increasing in younger individuals, possibly
because of the increase in obesity.35 These factors may help
to explain the rising rates in stroke among the later births
cohorts.
There was a significant downward trend in the rate of
STEMI for all age groups and in the rate of stroke in the older
age groups. It is important to try to understand the
differences in the rates of stroke and STEMI in the young.
While stroke rates showed increasing trends during the study
period in those younger than 50 years, STEMI rates declined
for the first 15 years of the study and remained constant for
the final 5 years. Stroke may be more related to control of
hypertension, whereas STEMI is more associated with plasma
lipid levels.36–39 As previously discussed, hypertension has
been shown to be less well controlled in younger versus older
age groups. In addition, the increasing prevalence of atrial
fibrillation in the young would have a greater impact on rates
of stroke than those of STEMI.40 While it is important to
understand the differences in stroke versus STEMI rate
changes in the young, it is also interesting that there appears
to be a trend towards slowing in the decline of rates of STEMI
in the younger age groups. These early trends may have
significant implications for the future.
Study Strengths
This study has a number of strengths. The data utilized were
from a large data set collected during 20 years. The accuracy
of the diagnoses for both STEMI and stroke have been
previously validated.16 New Jersey has a large, diverse
population with proportions of young and old and whites,
African Americans, and Hispanics similar to the overall United
States.41 In addition, health insurance coverage rates are
similar in New Jersey as in the rest of the United States.42
Thus, our results could be generalizable to other areas in the
United States.
Study Limitations
There are several limitations to this study. The data were from
an administrative source where diagnostic coding is intended
for healthcare reimbursement and could include a significant
rate of miscoding.43 However, the probability of miscoding for
MI and stroke is likely very low, as studies have found the
sensitivity and specificity for these two diagnoses in admin-
istrative records to be near or above 90%.43,44 During the

 course of this study, there have been changes in the use of
magnetic resonance imaging, raising the possibility of ascer-
tainment bias in stroke diagnoses. However, a recent study by
Kleindorfer and colleagues45 found minimal differences in
stroke discharge diagnoses with the use of magnetic
resonance imaging. Whether there could be secular shifts in
the probability of being hospitalized for minor stroke, and
whether such admission practices might differ by age, is not
known. We do not have data on emergency services response
time for stroke patients. It may be possible that if response
times were better in younger versus older patients than this
could account for some of the increase in stroke rates as
measured by hospital admissions. However, the data on
differential response rates by age are equivocal. Several
studies have found response rates to be better, worse, or no
different in older versus younger patients.46–48
Conclusions
The results from this study beg the question: “Has the ‘stroke-
healthiest’ generation come and gone?” Based on our
findings, there appears to a trend toward increasing rates of
ischemic stroke in those born after 1954. We also found a
slowing of the trend of decreasing STEMI rates, particularly in
those younger than 50 years. These trends may have
significant implications for health outcomes and the overall
healthcare burden in the future. Further analyses of these
outcomes in persons younger than 55 years should be done
in other populations to assess their reproducibility. Examina-
tion of cohorts that have been under close observation for
proven or suspected stroke, regardless of hospitalization, is
also needed. The present finding of increasing stroke rates in
persons younger than 55 years is unsettling and merits
vigorous inquiry.
