Purpose:
To evaluate age-related left ventricular (LV) remodel-
ing during longitudinal observation of a large cohort of 
asymptomatic individuals who were free of clinical cardio-
vascular disease at baseline.
Materials and 
Methods:
The applicable institutional review boards approved this 
study, and all participants gave informed consent. Car-
diac magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was used to iden-
tify longitudinal changes in LV structure and function in 
2935 participants who underwent baseline and follow-up 
cardiac MR imaging in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Athero-
sclerosis. Participants were free of clinical cardiovascular 
disease at baseline. Participants who experienced an in-
cident coronary heart disease event were excluded. Data 
were analyzed with multivariable mixed-effects regression 
models in which the outcome was cardiac MR imaging 
measurement, and the covariates included follow-up time 
and cardiac risk factors.
Results:
Participants were aged 54–94 years at follow-up, and 
53% of the participants were women. Median time be-
tween baseline and follow-up cardiac MR imaging was 9.4 
years. Over this period, LV mass increased in men and 
decreased slightly in women (8.0 and 21.6 g per decade, 
respectively; P , .001). In both men and women, LV end-
diastolic volume decreased (29.8 and 213.3 mL per de-
cade, respectively; P , .001), stroke volume decreased 
(28.8 and 28.6 mL per decade, respectively; P , .001), 
and mass-to-volume ratio increased (0.14 and 0.11 g/mL 
per decade, respectively; P , .001). Change in LV mass 
was positively associated with systolic blood pressure and 
body mass index and negatively associated with treated 
hypertension and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
level. In men, the longitudinal LV mass increase was in 
contrast to a cross-sectional pattern of LV mass decrease.
Conclusion:
As patients age, the LV responds differently in its mass 
and volume between men and women, although both men 
and women experience increased concentric LV remodel-
ing with age. In men, the opposition of longitudinal and 
cross-sectional changes in LV mass highlights the impor-
tance of longitudinal study.

follow-up examination that included 
measurement of height and weight. 
Questionnaires were administered to 
assess smoking history, exercise habits, 
current use of medications, and phy-
sician diagnoses of hypertension and 
diabetes. Brachial artery blood pres-
sure was measured three times in the 
seated position, and the mean of the 
second and third measurements was 
used for analysis. Glucose, triglycer-
ides, total cholesterol, and high-density 
lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels 
were measured after 12 hours of fast-
ing. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cho-
lesterol levels were calculated with the 
Friedewald equation (18).
Follow-up MR Imaging (MESA 
Examination 5)
As part of the fifth follow-up MESA ex-
amination, consenting participants un-
derwent cardiac MR imaging at facilities 
associated with each field center. Imag-
ing was performed with 1.5-T imagers 
(Magnetom Avanto and Magnetom 
We hypothesized that analysis of 
longitudinal data may help clarify incon-
sistencies in previous cross-sectional 
results concerning age-related cardiac 
remodeling. Thus, the purpose of this 
study was to evaluate age-related LV 
remodeling during longitudinal obser-
vation of a large cohort of asymptom-
atic individuals who were free of clinical 
cardiovascular disease at baseline.
Materials and Methods
Baseline Study Population (MESA 
Examination 1)
The study population was drawn from 
a cohort of 6814 individuals who were 
enrolled in the Multi-Ethnic Study of 
Atherosclerosis (MESA). Detailed study 
design and objectives are described else-
where (15). Briefly, study participants 
were enrolled between July 2000 and 
September 2002 from six community-
based centers in the United States. At 
the time of enrollment, participants 
were aged 45–84 years and had no his-
tory of clinical cardiovascular disease, 
which included coronary artery disease, 
peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovas-
cular disease, and heart failure. The co-
hort represents four self-reported racial 
groups: white, black, Latino, and Asian. 
The Asian participants were predomi-
nantly of Chinese descent. LV structure 
and function were assessed with car-
diac MR imaging in 5004 study partic-
ipants to determine LV mass, volume, 
and function by using a fast gradient-
echo technique, as described previously 
(4,16,17). Institutional review boards at 
each of the six field centers approved the 
baseline and follow-up study protocols.

Advances in Knowledge
 
n The aging left ventricle (LV) 
responded differently in terms of 
mass and volume between men 
and women.
 
n LV mass increased in men (8.0 g 
per decade, P , .001) and 
decreased slightly in women 
(21.6 g per decade, P , .001) 
after nearly a decade of longitu-
dinal follow-up; however, mass-
to-volume ratio increased simi-
larly in both men and women 
(0.14 and 0.11 g/mL per decade, 
respectively; P , .001).
 
n In men, the longitudinal changes 
in LV mass were in opposition to 
cross-sectional changes observed 
in past studies, highlighting the 
importance of the longitudinal 
study.
Implication for Patient Care
 
n The study results shed light on 
the pathophysiology of heart fail-
ure in elderly patients, particu-
larly heart failure with preserved 
ejection fraction.
M
ultiple population-based studies 
(1–4) have shown left ventricu-
lar (LV) mass and geometry are 
independent predictors of cardiovascu-
lar disease events. These associations 
exist in individuals with a prior history 
of coronary heart disease or heart fail-
ure and those without (5,6). Treatment 
to reduce LV mass has been shown to 
decrease the incidence of cardiovascu-
lar events (7). These epidemiologic and 
therapeutic relationships support the 
role of LV mass as an important subclin-
ical marker for cardiovascular disease.
LV mass is associated with multiple 
sociodemographic and cardiovascular 
risk factors, including age, sex, body size, 
smoking history, physical activity, and 
hypertension (8). Age-related geometric 
changes in the LV
, termed remodeling, 
are primarily described in cross-sec-
tional studies. Cross-sectional studies 
have shown both increases (9–12) and 
decreases (13) in LV mass with age. In a 
longitudinal Framingham study, LV mass 
was observed to increase with age (14). 
Some of the apparent discrepancies in 
these studies may be related to differ-
ences in the methods used to measure 
LV mass (two-dimensional echocardiog-
raphy versus magnetic resonance [MR] 
imaging), differences in cardiovascular 
disease prevalence at baseline, or both.

(13,17), to describe how the longitudi-
nal change of each cardiac MR imaging 
parameter was affected by each risk 
factor. Model 2 also contained inter-
action terms between follow-up time 
and all other covariates. Each interac-
tion term represented the correspond-
ing covariate effect on the longitudinal 
change of the outcome variable, while 
the linear terms adjusted for baseline 
values (Appendix E1 [online]).
The risk factors in model 2 were 
considered fixed effects that were 
constant between the baseline and fol-
low-up time points. Model 2 covariates 
determined from the follow-up MESA 
examination were age, sex, race or eth-
nicity (four categories), current use of 
antihypertensive medications (yes or 
no), current use of lipid-lowering med-
ications (yes or no), current smoking 
status (yes or no), and glucose metab-
olism status. Glucose metabolism was 
represented by three mutually exclusive 
categories: diabetes (fasting glucose 
level 126 mg/dL [7.0 mmol/L] or 
use of insulin or hypoglycemic medica-
tion), impaired fasting glucose (not di-
abetic with fasting glucose level 100 
mg/dL [5.6 mmol/L] and ,126 mg/
dL [,7.0 mmol/L]), or normoglycemic 
(not diabetic and fasting glucose level 
,100 mg/dL [,5.6 mmol/L]). Means 
of two measurements, baseline and fol-
low-up, were used as covariates for the 
following continuously distributed vari-
ables: systolic blood pressure, diastolic 
blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), 
LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol.
The models’ fit to the data was as-
sessed by inspecting plots of residuals 
against all covariates and against pre-
dicted values to look for nonrandom 
patterns that may indicate nonlinear-
ity or heteroscedasticity. All analyses 
were conducted with the Stata software 
package (version 13.1; Stata, College 
Station, Tex) and were based on the 
MESA data set released in June 2013. P 
, .05 indicated a significant difference.
Results
Of the 5004 MESA participants who un-
derwent baseline cardiac MR imaging, 
3565 (71%) returned for the follow-up 
steady-state free precession, that is 
currently the standard of care, but this 
sequence was not available during the 
baseline examination. Steady-state free 
precession enables a faster examination 
of higher quality (22), but it is known 
to produce LV mass measurements that 
are smaller than those obtained with the 
fast gradient-echo pulse sequence of the 
baseline examination (23). To adjust for 
this difference, calibration curves were 
applied to each participant’s baseline 
LV mass and volume measurements. 
These curves were obtained from 498 
randomly chosen participants who un-
derwent fast gradient-echo MR imaging 
in addition to steady-state free preces-
sion MR imaging during the follow-up 
examination (Appendix E1 [online]). 
Besides the pulse sequence differences, 
these calibration curves also enabled 
adjustment for potential differences 
associated with reader, analysis soft-
ware, and scanner equipment changes 
between the baseline and follow-up ex-
aminations. All calibration curves were 
found to be linear and were fitted with 
ordinary regression methods.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed with two sets of 
multivariable mixed-effects regression 
models. Each of the cardiac MR imag-
ing parameters was the outcome (de-
pendent) variable of one model in each 
set. Model 1 describes age and birth 
cohort effects, with sex as a potential 
effect modifier. Thus, age at baseline, 
follow-up time, and sex were the covari-
ates (independent variables) for model 
1, with interaction terms between sex 
and the other two covariates. An inter-
action term between all three covariates 
represented how longitudinal changes 
varied by age. The time covariate was 
equal to 0 for the baseline cardiac pa-
rameters. For the follow-up parame-
ters, the time variable was equal to the 
elapsed time between baseline and fol-
low-up examinations. Time was treated 
as a random effect with random slopes 
and intercepts among participants (Ap-
pendix E1 [online]).
Model 2 added key traditional car-
diovascular risk factors, similar to those 
appearing in published baseline models

care, Waukesha, Wis) with a six-channel 
anterior phased-array torso coil and cor-
responding posterior coil elements. The 
cardiac MR imaging protocol included 
acquisition of one cine horizontal long-
axis section (four-chamber view), at 
least 12 cine short-axis sections from the 
atria to the cardiac apex, and one cine 
vertical long-axis section (two-chamber 
view). LV dimensions, function, and 
myocardial mass were assessed with a 
cine steady-state free precession pulse 
sequence. Imaging was performed with 
retrospective electrocardiographic gat-
ing for 50 phases (temporal resolution 
40 msec), 360 3 360 mm field of view, 
256 3 192 image matrix, 8-mm section 
thickness, and 2-mm section gap (for 
short-axis images).
Cardiac MR imaging data were 
transferred to a central reading center 
by using secure transmission software 
(19). Trained readers were overseen 
by two cardiac MR imaging physicians 
(D.A.B., J.A.C.L.), each with over 15 
years of clinical and research interpre-
tation experience. The readers mea-
sured LV end-diastolic volume (EDV), 
LV end-systolic volume (ESV), and LV 
end-diastolic mass with the CIM soft-
ware package (version 6.2; Auckland 
MR Imaging Research Group, Univer-
sity of Auckland, Auckland, New Zea-
land) (20). Papillary muscles were in-
cluded in the LV volumes and excluded 
from the LV mass. Readers had no 
knowledge of participant risk factors 
or other clinical information. LV stroke 
volume was calculated as LV EDV mi-
nus LV ESV, and ejection fraction (EF) 
was calculated as follows: EF = [(LV 
EDV–LV ESV)/LV EDV]·100.
For quality control purposes, all 
readers independently analyzed every 
10th consecutive cardiac MR imaging 
study. The overall interobserver intra-
class correlation coefficients for LV mass 
and LV EDV were 0.95 and 0.96, respec-
tively, and technical errors of measure-
ment (21) were 6.1% and 5.4%, re-
spectively. Interobserver agreement was 
similar to that in the baseline study (16).
The follow-up imaging protocol

mass-to-volume ratio increased when 
the LV mass was viewed either longitu-
dinally or cross-sectionally. All of these 
relationships were significant in model 
1 (Table 3). When stratified by race or 
ethnicity, longitudinal and cross-sec-
tional relationships within strata were 
found to be qualitatively consistent with 
the overall relationships.
The three-way interaction term 
of model 1 (last two rows of Table 3) 
shows that longitudinal changes in LV 
mass were slightly less positive (or 
more negative) in older age groups 
for both men and women. In women, 
longitudinal LV EDV reduction was 
slightly greater in older age groups. 
These interactions are seen as a slight

ments within the corresponding bands

for each age group, and the trends be-
tween successive line segments repre-
sent cross-sectional patterns among 
the age groups. If period effects are 
assumed to be constant, then each 
individual line segment in the Figure 
represents an isolated age-related ef-
fect, and the trends between successive 
line segments for each sex represent a 
combination of age and birth cohort ef-
fects (24). For men, LV mass increased 
longitudinally (8.0 g per decade from 
model 1) for all age groups; this was 
in contrast to a decrease (23.7 g per 
decade) when LV mass was viewed 
cross-sectionally. For women, LV mass 
decreased slightly (21.6 g per decade) 
when viewed longitudinally and did not 
change when viewed cross-sectionally. 
In both men and women, LV EDV de-
creased, stroke volume decreased, and 
MESA examination. Of these 3565 par-
ticipants, 2981 (84%) were eligible for 
and consented to undergo follow-up 
cardiac MR imaging. Of these 2981 
participants who underwent both base-
line and follow-up cardiac MR imaging, 
we excluded 46 participants who expe-
rienced actual coronary heart disease 
events, defined as myocardial infarction 
or resuscitated cardiac arrest. The re-
maining 2935 participants who under-
went follow-up were the subjects of 
analysis in this study.
The median time between base-
line and follow-up cardiac MR imaging 
was 9.4 years. When compared with 
the 5004 baseline participants, the 
participants who underwent follow-up 
MR imaging were younger and had a 
higher level of education, on average; 
a higher proportion of white partici-
pants and a lower proportion of Latino 
participants underwent follow-up MR 
imaging (Table 1). In addition, among 
participants who underwent follow-up 
MR imaging, there was lower systolic 
blood pressure; fewer participants 
with hypertension, smoking history, or 
diabetes; and a slightly greater amount 
of exercise when compared with those 
who underwent only baseline MR im-
aging (Table 1).
Among 
the 
2935 
participants, 
mean age was 69.0 years 6 9.2 (stan-
dard deviation) (range, 54–94 years), 
with 53.0% of the participants being 
women; 42.3%, white; 24.9%, black; 
20.3%, Latino; and 12.5%, Asian. At 
the time of follow-up, 56.5% of par-
ticipants had hypertension, 20.7% 
had impaired fasting glucose, 16.9% 
had diabetes, 7.5% were smokers, 
and 36.8% were taking lipid-lowering 
medication.
Sex-specific mean cardiac MR im-
aging measurements for the follow-up 
examination are listed in Table 2 along 
with the mean baseline values. Longi-
tudinal changes observed in LV mass 
and volume are shown along with their 
cross-sectional patterns in the Figure. 
 
Coefficients from model 1 describe 
these longitudinal and cross-sectional 
patterns quantitatively (Table 3). In the

resent observed longitudinal changes

than true LV mass when compared with 
three-dimensional imaging techniques, 
such as cardiac MR imaging and three-
dimensional echocardiography.
The longitudinal decrease in LV EDV 
and stroke volume we observed in par-
ticipants who underwent follow-up is 
consistent with cross-sectional age rela-
tionships reported in the MESA cohort 
at baseline (13). More recent cross-sec-
tional studies in healthy volunteers with 
three-dimensional 
echocardiography 
have shown an inverse relationship 
between LV volume and age (25–27). 
These volume relationships are in con-
trast to the findings of earlier studies 
that reported LV volume increased with 
age (28,29). However, those earlier 
studies used radionuclide ventriculogra-
phy, which is an indirect measurement 
of LV volume that relies on a number 
of image processing corrections and 
geometric assumptions that cardiac MR 
imaging does not require (30).
This study provided an opportunity 
to compare longitudinal results with 
cross-sectional results in the same group 
of patients. We found that LV mass and 
volume had similar sex-specific longitu-
dinal and cross-sectional trends except 
for one measurement group: LV mass 
in men (Figure). The LV mass in men 
implies an underlying cohort effect 
that operates in a direction opposite 
of the age effect. This apparent cohort 
significant longitudinal decreases in LV 
EDV and stroke volume in both men 
and women. These changes combined 
to produce significant increases in ad-
verse remodeling of the LV, as shown 
by increasing mass-to-volume ratios in 
both men and women.
In contrast to our findings, longitu-
dinal data from the Framingham study, 
in which two-dimensional echocardiog-
raphy was used with 16-year follow-up, 
showed that LV mass increased sharply 
over time in both men and women, with 
a greater increase observed in women 
than in men (14). The apparent discrep-
ancy may be related to clinical differ-
ences in the cohorts or to differences in 
how LV mass was determined between 
the two studies (cardiac MR imaging 
versus two-dimensional echocardiog-
raphy). More recently, cross-sectional 
data from three-dimensional echocardi-
ography revealed no significant change 
between LV mass and age in either men 
or women (25). In the same cross-sec-
tional study (25), LV EDV decreased 
with age so that mass-to-volume ratio 
was observed to increase with age in 
both men and women, similar to find-
ings in the present study. It is possible 
that the geometric assumptions re-
quired by two-dimensional echocardi-
ography to determine LV mass result in 
an imaging technique that is more cor-
related with LV mass-to-volume ratio 
Table 4 lists selected terms from 
model 2. These selected terms are the 
model’s interaction terms between risk 
factors and elapsed time; thus, they in-
dicate how the risk factors affect the 
longitudinal change of LV mass and 
volume in a paired comparison of two 
time points (baseline and follow-up) 
after adjustment for sociodemographic 
and baseline risk factors. Systolic blood 
pressure was positively associated with 
longitudinal change in LV mass, LV 
EDV, and stroke volume (P  .002 for 
all). BMI and use of antihypertensive 
medication were positively and neg-
atively associated with change in LV 
mass, respectively (P  .001 for all). 
Diastolic blood pressure, smoking his-
tory, and BMI were negatively associ-
ated with changes in both LV EDV and 
stroke volume (P , .001 for all).
Residual plots for LV mass and vol-
ume from both models 1 and 2 showed 
no nonrandom patterns that would 
suggest nonlinearity or substantial 
heteroscedasticity.
Discussion
In this longitudinal study of a cohort 
free of clinical cardiovascular disease 
at baseline, we observed a significant 
age-related longitudinal increase in LV 
mass in men and a slight longitudi-
nal decrease in women. We observed

ratio was steeper than the cross-sec-
tional effect (age and birth cohort).
The multivariable risk factor models 
(model 2) were dominated by variables 
related to blood pressure, BMI, and 
smoking history. It is not surprising that 
blood pressure is one of the dominant 
variables because it has been found to 
be the most important predictor of LV 
hypertrophy in many population studies 
younger; therefore, they had smaller LV 
masses at baseline. Regardless of base-
line LV mass, we observed that longitu-
dinal increases in LV mass in men were 
similar across all age groups, as indi-
cated by the similar slopes of the indi-
vidual line segments in the Figure (part 
a). We also observed that for both men 
and women, the longitudinal effect (age 
alone) of increasing mass-to-volume 
effect may reflect a true birth cohort 
effect; however, another strong possi-
bility is that these results may be the 
consequence of excluding participants 
with clinical cardiovascular disease at 
baseline, producing a study population 
of healthier individuals. Thus, earlier 
cohorts (represented by line segments 
toward the right side of the graphs in 
the Figure, part a) were physiologically 
Age-related longitudinal and cross-sectional changes of LV mass and volume by sex. Individual line segments represent observed longitudinal changes for each 
age group, and the trends between successive line segments represent cross-sectional patterns among the age groups. (a) LV mass increased longitudinally and 
decreased cross-sectionally in men. (b) LV EDV and (c) stroke volume decreased both longitudinally and cross-sectionally in both men and women. (d) Mass-to-
volume ratio increased both longitudinally and cross-sectionally in both men and women.

associated with a longitudinal decrease 
in LV volume. A possible explanation 
for this relationship is the observation 
that smoking may be associated with 
myocardial fibrosis, which affects the 
volume of the LV cavity (31,32). Smok-
ing is also associated with LV dysfunc-
tion in the MESA cohort (33).
to be most commonly associated with 
a pattern of concentric LV remodeling 
(increased mass, decreased volume). 
We observed similarly in this study 
that obesity, as indicated by BMI, was 
associated with a longitudinal increase 
in LV mass and a decrease in LV vol-
ume. We also found that smoking was 
(8). The pattern of positive correlation 
between systolic blood pressure and LV 
mass and volume and negative corre-
lation between diastolic blood pressure 
and LV volume has also been observed 
in a number of population studies (8).
In both cross-sectional and longitu-
dinal studies, obesity has been found

a longitudinal LV mass increase in men 
and a slight decrease in women, while LV 
EDV decreased and mass-to-volume ra-
tio increased longitudinally for both men 
and women. These longitudinal trends 
are congruent with previous cross-sec-
tional observations in this cohort. A no-
table exception to this congruence was 
observed in men, where the longitudinal 
increase in LV mass was opposite to the 
cross-sectional decrease with age that 
was observed previously. These results 
highlight the importance of longitudinal 
study and suggest sex-specific differ-
ences in age-related cardiac remodeling. 
Further research is needed to under-
stand the mechanism behind these sex-
specific differences.

However, the incomplete follow-up 
caused missingness of the cardiac MR 
imaging measurements, which were the 
main outcome variables. Unfortunately, 
multiple imputation has been shown to 
provide no substantial advantage when 
the missingness involves the outcome 
variable (36), as in our study.
When interpreting results from the 
MESA study, it should be noted that 
the MESA cohort was not intended to 
be a population of completely healthy 
individuals. The goal of MESA was to 
examine correlates and progression of 
subclinical cardiovascular disease, so 
by design the MESA cohort included 
participants with conditions that are 
known risk factors for cardiovascular 
disease, such as diabetes and hyper-
tension. While MESA participants may 
be considered to be relatively healthy 
since patients with overt cardiovascular 
disease were excluded at baseline, the 
study population still represents a spec-
trum of cardiovascular disease risk.
Individuals in epidemiologic studies 
are subject to three sources of tem-
poral effects: age, cohort, and period. 
Because these three temporal effects 
are collinear, it is mathematically im-
possible to estimate all three effects si-
multaneously from a data set without 
applying an additional constraint (24). 
In interpreting the results of this study, 
we assumed that period effects were 
constant, meaning that factors affecting 
all individuals equally, such as environ-
ment and medical practice, were as-
sumed to be constant during the study 
period, on average. Of the three pos-
sible temporal effects, potential period 
effects influence the shortest length of 
time, which is the 10-year study pe-
riod. Both age and cohort effects oper-
ate over a participant’s entire lifetime, 
which is much longer than the study 
period. Furthermore, both age and 
cohort are associated with well-known 
cardiovascular risk factors. Past trends, 
such as those involving obesity, diet, 
and exercise, are major cohort effects 
since they have a differential influence 
on successive cohorts.
In summary, in a cohort of individ-
uals who were free of clinical cardiovas-
cular disease at baseline, we observed 
In patients with hypertension, car-
diac myocyte sarcomeres are added in 
parallel, causing myocardial wall thick-
ness to increase out of proportion to the 
volume of the LV cavity (34). Thus, a rel-
ative decrease in LV volume might be ex-
plained by an increase in LV mass. How-
ever, we observed that in women, LV 
volume decreased with age even though 
there was no corresponding increase 
in LV mass. This finding suggests that 
some other mechanism may be dimin-
ishing LV volume in women or that the 
causal relationship between mass and 
volume in women may be different than 
that in men. One possible hypothesis 
is that these results reflect sex-specific 
variations in diffuse myocardial fibrosis, 
which may inhibit LV volume changes 
during remodeling. In the MESA cohort, 
there is evidence from myocardial T1 
mapping that diffuse myocardial fibrosis 
is greater in women but is associated 
with a greater age-related increase in 
men (35). The sex-specific LV mass and 
volume differences observed in the pre-
sent study may also signal the need for 
sex-specific treatment approaches for 
the adverse effects of myocardial remod-
eling, such as heart failure.
Our study was subject to some limi-
tations. Of the 5004 MESA participants 
who underwent baseline cardiac MR im-
aging, follow-up MR imaging data were 
obtained for only 60% (n = 2981). Be-
cause of response and survivor bias, the 
follow-up study population was dispro-
portionately healthier than the baseline 
population. Motivation to adopt health-
ier behaviors also may have occurred. 
These factors are important sources of 
potential selection bias. However, we 
do not believe selection bias would al-
ter the longitudinal results qualitatively. 
If selection bias was absent and if the 
study population was less healthy, we 
would expect to observe directionally 
similar age-related longitudinal changes 
to an even greater degree than what we 
observed in the present study.
Multiple imputation has been used 
to adjust for missing data, so we ex-
plored the possibility of using this sta-
tistical technique to adjust for the po-
tential selection bias associated with 
incomplete follow-up in our study.
