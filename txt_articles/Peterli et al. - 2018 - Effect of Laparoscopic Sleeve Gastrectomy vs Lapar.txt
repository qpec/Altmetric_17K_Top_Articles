Abstract: Importance Sleeve gastrectomy is increasingly used in the treatment of morbid obesity, but its
long-term outcome vs the standard Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure is unknown. Objective To deter-
mine whether there are differences between sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in terms of
weight loss, changes in comorbidities, increase in quality of life, and adverse events. Design, Setting, and
Participants The Swiss Multicenter Bypass or Sleeve Study (SM-BOSS), a 2-group randomized trial, was
conducted from January 2007 until November 2011 (last follow-up in March 2017). Of 3971 morbidly
obese patients evaluated for bariatric surgery at 4 Swiss bariatric centers, 217 patients were enrolled and
randomly assigned to sleeve gastrectomy or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with a 5-year follow-up period.
Interventions Patients were randomly assigned to undergo laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (n = 107) or
laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (n = 110). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary end point
was weight loss, expressed as percentage excess body mass index (BMI) loss. Exploratory end points
were changes in comorbidities and adverse events.
Results Among the 217 patients (mean age, 45.5
years; 72% women; mean BMI, 43.9) 205 (94.5%) completed the trial. Excess BMI loss was not signifi-
cantly different at 5 years: for sleeve gastrectomy, 61.1%, vs Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, 68.3% (absolute
difference, −7.18%; 95% CI, −14.30% to −0.06%; P = .22 after adjustment for multiple comparisons).
Gastric reflux remission was observed more frequently after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (60.4%) than after
sleeve gastrectomy (25.0%). Gastric reflux worsened (more symptoms or increase in therapy) more often
after sleeve gastrectomy (31.8%) than after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (6.3%). The number of patients
with reoperations or interventions was 16/101 (15.8%) after sleeve gastrectomy and 23/104 (22.1%) after
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with morbid obesity, there was
no significant difference in excess BMI loss between laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass at 5 years of follow-up after surgery.

IMPORTANCE Sleeve gastrectomy is increasingly used in the treatment of morbid obesity, but
its long-term outcome vs the standard Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure is unknown.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether there are differences between sleeve gastrectomy and
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in terms of weight loss, changes in comorbidities, increase in quality
of life, and adverse events.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Swiss Multicenter Bypass or Sleeve Study
(SM-BOSS), a 2-group randomized trial, was conducted from January 2007 until November
2011 (last follow-up in March 2017). Of 3971 morbidly obese patients evaluated for bariatric
surgery at 4 Swiss bariatric centers, 217 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to
sleeve gastrectomy or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with a 5-year follow-up period.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly assigned to undergo laparoscopic sleeve
gastrectomy (n = 107) or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (n = 110).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was weight loss, expressed as
percentage excess body mass index (BMI) loss. Exploratory end points were changes in
comorbidities and adverse events.
RESULTS Among the 217 patients (mean age, 45.5 years; 72% women; mean BMI, 43.9) 205
(94.5%) completed the trial. Excess BMI loss was not significantly different at 5 years: for
sleeve gastrectomy, 61.1%, vs Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, 68.3% (absolute difference, −7.18%;
95% CI, −14.30% to −0.06%; P = .22 after adjustment for multiple comparisons). Gastric
reflux remission was observed more frequently after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (60.4%) than
after sleeve gastrectomy (25.0%). Gastric reflux worsened (more symptoms or increase in
therapy) more often after sleeve gastrectomy (31.8%) than after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass
(6.3%). The number of patients with reoperations or interventions was 16/101 (15.8%) after
sleeve gastrectomy and 23/104 (22.1%) after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with morbid obesity, there was no significant
difference in excess BMI loss between laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass at 5 years of follow-up after surgery.

 B
ariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for pa-
tients with morbid obesity. Until recently, Roux-en-Y
gastric bypass was regarded as the standard bariatric
procedure. However, sleeve gastrectomy is being performed
with increasing frequency despite the lack of evidence regard-
ing its long-term efficacy.1 The sleeve gastrectomy procedure
is technically easier, faster to perform, and potentially safer
comparedwithRoux-en-Ygastricbypass.However,muchmore
data on clinical and metabolic long-term outcomes are avail-
ableontheRoux-en-Ygastricbypassprocedure.Earlyandmid-
term results of sleeve gastrectomy showed potential benefit,
but only a limited number of randomized studies have com-
pared outcomes of sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric
bypass head to head, most of which were underpowered
because of low patient numbers, short follow-up, or both.2-6
The purpose of this trial was to compare differences be-
tween sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in the
treatment of morbid obesity in terms of weight loss, changes
in comorbidities, quality of life, and adverse events.
Methods
The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of
the Declaration of Helsinki,7 approved by each local ethical
committee, and registered at the clinical trials registry of the
National Institutes of Health. All patients gave written in-
formed consent.
Study Design
The trial protocol and statistical analysis plan are available in
Supplement1.Inbrief,thetrialwasa2-group,randomized,mul-
ticenter study including 217 patients with morbid obesity at 4
bariatric centers in Switzerland and conducted from January
2007 until November 2011, with final follow-up in March 2017
(Figure1).Oneofthe4centerswasaddedin2008toincreasethe
size of the study population and decrease the enrollment time.
Participants
Following the general criteria for bariatric surgery in
Switzerland, study inclusion criteria were a body mass index
(BMI) greater than 40 or a BMI greater than 35 with the pres-
ence of at least 1 comorbidity (BMI calculated as weight in
kilograms divided by height in meters squared), an age of 18
to 65 years, and failure of conservative treatment for 2 years.
Exclusion criteria were contraindications for major abdomi-
nalsurgery,previousbariatricsurgery,severesymptomaticgas-
troesophageal reflux disease despite medication, large hiatal
hernia, expected dense adhesions at the level of the small
bowel, need for endoscopic follow-up of the duodenum, and
history of inflammatory bowel disease.
Randomization
A central, computer-based block randomization (block size
of 20) with sealed envelopes was carried out. There was no
blinding with regard to the type of operation: patients as well
as physicians and dietitians assessing follow-up data were in-
formed about the procedure performed.
Interventions
In sleeve gastrectomy, the majority of the stomach is verti-
callyresectedandatube-shapedremnantisleftalongthelesser
curvature. In Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, a small gastric pouch
is connected to the small intestine, bypassing the stomach,
duodenum, and the proximal part of the jejunum. The 2 in-
terventions were standardized across the centers and all pro-
cedures were performed laparoscopically. The surgical inter-
ventions, number of participating surgeons, and centers are
described in more detail in Table 1 and Table 2 and in eAppen-
dix 1 in Supplement 2.
Outcomes
All patients were assessed as part of a routine follow-up pro-
gram in the outpatient clinic of each participating center ac-
cording to Swiss guidelines and were seen on a regular sched-
ule 6 weeks and 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months postoperatively.
Thereafter,patientswereseenannually.Theprimaryendpoint
of the study was weight loss, defined as percentage excess BMI
loss(100×[baselineBMI−follow-upBMI]/[baselineBMI−25]),
over a 5-year period. Weight was measured at each visit. Ex-
ploratory clinical end points were (1) changes in comorbidities
(arterial hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, obstruc-
tive sleep apnea, gastroesophageal reflux, arthralgia, depres-
sion, and hyperuricemia; assessed by a physician at each visit);

Key Points
Question Is there a difference in weight loss between
laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y
gastric bypass in patients with morbid obesity?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 217 adults
with morbid obesity, percentage excess body mass index loss in
patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy compared with gastric
bypass was 61.1% vs 68.3% after 5 years, a difference that was not
statistically significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons.
Meaning This study did not find a significant difference in weight
loss between sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass.

 outcomes included BMI changes, weight loss, percentage of
originalweightloss,andcutpointsof25%,50%,and75%inex-
cess BMI loss (scale of weight loss divided into quartiles follow-
ing the classification of the BAROS score10).
Statistical Analysis
ThepowerestimationforexcesspercentageBMIlosswasbased
on the assumptions of equal variances in both treatment
groups, a pooled standard deviation of 20%, a base effect of
excess BMI loss at 5 years of 50% in the control group and a
minimum detectable difference of an additional 10%, and an
α=.05. A sample size of 100 patients per group was estimated
to provide a power of 94% to reject the null hypothesis of equal
means using a 2-sided, 2-sample equal-variance t test.17,18 Ac-
cording to a meta-analysis, a difference of 10% in excess BMI
loss resulted in a superior type 2 diabetes remission rate when
comparing gastric banding, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and bil-
iopancreatic diversion.19 Therefore, a minimal difference of
10% excess BMI loss was considered clinically relevant.
All comparisons between treatment groups are reported
as absolute differences with 95% confidence intervals and
P values. Missing follow-up data were imputed by a multiple
imputation technique using the fully conditional specifica-
tion method based on Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation.
From the imputed data set, the other weight-related param-
eters were calculated.
Longitudinal data were first analyzed for all of the
follow-up time points jointly by a linear mixed-effects model
analysisusingtypeofintervention,center,sex,andvisits(time)
as fixed effects and age and initial BMI as random effects, in
which visits represented the repeated measures of the longi-
tudinal data. This approach was used instead of the originally
planned repeated-measures analysis of variance to better cap-
ture the data structure of the repeated measures. Afterward,
pairwise comparisons between treatment groups were per-
formed for each time point separately, with multiple un-
paired t tests with subsequent step-down Bonferroni-Holm
correction for P-value adjustment for multiple comparisons.
For the analysis of adverse events and comorbidities, pro-
portions were compared by χ2 and Fisher exact tests as appro-
priate. Exploratory outcomes were compared between base-
line and 5-year follow-up and for the difference between both
time points. All statistical tests were 2-sided and P < .05 was
considered statistically significant.
SPSS for Windows, version 25 (IBM), and R, version 3.4.2
(RProjectforStatisticalComputing,RFoundation;http://www
.r-project.org/; chisq.test, fisher.test, and prop.test) were used
for data analysis (see original statistical plan in Supplement 1
and eAppendix 2 in Supplement 2).
Results
Of the 225 patients randomized, a total of 217 were included
and randomly assigned to undergo either sleeve gastrectomy
(n = 107) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (n= 110). Eight patients
were excluded from the analysis: 7 patients chose to undergo
later operation (when the enrollment phase had already been
concluded) and 1 patient crossed over from the Roux-en-Y
gastric bypass group to the sleeve gastrectomy group be-
cause of unexpected dense adhesions of the jejunum, which
were detected intraoperatively. Baseline demographic char-
acteristics are shown in Table 1. After 5 years, data from 205
patients (94.5%) were available for evaluation. Ten patients
were lost to follow-up, 2 patients died (1 within 30 days of
operation because of a surgical complication and 1 after 2.5
years because of lymphoma) (Figure 1). Missing data for weight
was 0% at baseline, 0.46% at 1 year, 25.8% at 2 years, 3.2% at
3 years, 31.8% at 4 years, and 5.5% (including 12 dropouts)
at 5 years. All reported P values are corrected for multiple com-
parisons unless indicated otherwise.
Primary Outcome
Overall, both treatments significantly reduced percentage ex-
cessBMIlossovertheobservationperiod,withsignificantover-
alldifferencesbetweenthegroupswithoutadjustmentformul-

that adjusted for multiple comparisons, there were no statis-

respectively, at 1 year (72.4% vs 76.7%; absolute difference,

difference, −7.18%; 95% CI, −14.30% to −0.06%; P = .22)
(Figure 2). Results without adjustment for multiple compari-
sons were not significantly affected by center (P = .19; for ab-
solute differences among centers, see eTables 2 and 3 in
Supplement 2), age (absolute difference, 0.25%; 95% CI,
0.004%-0.50%; P = .28), and sex (absolute difference, 5.45%;
95% CI, −0.72% to 11.61%; P = .08), but initial BMI (absolute
difference, −1.44; 95% CI, −1.94 to −0.94; P < .001) signifi-
cantly contributed to the percentage excess BMI loss.
There was a significant trend (P < .001) for a linear de-
crease in excess BMI loss over the follow-up period for both
treatment groups (for sleeve gastrectomy, slope, −3.05% [95%
CI, −4.53% to −1.58%] per year; P < .001; intercept, 77.0% [95%
CI, 72.07%-81.85%]; P < .001 and for Roux-en-Y gastric by-
pass, slope, −2.34% [95% CI, −3.72% to −0.97%] per year;
P = .001; intercept, 80.4% [95% CI, 75.9%-85.0%]; P < .001).
Exploratory Outcomes
At baseline, 26 (25.7%) of 101 in the sleeve gastrectomy group
and 28 (26.9%) of 104 in the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass group
had type 2 diabetes; 6 (23.1%) of 26 in the sleeve gastrectomy
groupand6(21.4%)of28intheRoux-en-Ygastricbypassgroup
were receiving insulin treatment. At 5 years after surgery, com-
plete remission was seen in 16 (61.5%) of 26 in the sleeve gas-
trectomy group vs 19 (67.9%) of 28 in the Roux-en-Y gastric
bypass group (absolute difference, −0.04%; 95% CI, −0.37%
to 0.28%; P > .99). Marked amelioration of glycemic control
was seen after 5 years compared with baseline, with no sig-
nificant differences between the treatment groups in fasting
glucose (sleeve gastrectomy, 114.1 mg/dL, vs Roux-en-Y gastric
bypass, 101.1 mg/dL; absolute difference, 13.0 mg/dL; 95% CI,
−7.50 to 33.49 mg/dL; P = .21) or hemoglobin A1c (sleeve gas-
trectomy, 6.2%, vs Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, 5.9%; absolute
difference, 0.30%; 95% CI, −0.06% to 0.82%; P = .09), uncor-
rected for multiple comparisons (Table 3 and Table 4).
Before surgery, 68 (67.3%) of 101 in the sleeve gastrec-
tomy group and 53 (51%) of 104 in the Roux-en-Y gastric by-
pass group had dyslipidemia. Complete remission was seen in
29 (42.6%) of 68 in the sleeve gastrectomy group vs 33 (62.3%)
of 53 in the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass group 5 years after sur-
gery(absolutedifference,−0.19%;95%CI,−0.38%to−0.003%)

terol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density li-
poprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides in both groups
(Table 4). Although there was no significant difference in total
and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides be-
tween the groups, the ratio of total cholesterol to high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol (sleeve gastrectomy, 3.3, vs
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, 3.0; absolute difference, 0.38; 95%
CI, 0.06-0.70; P = .02) and low-density lipoprotein choles-

pass, 101.1 mg/dL; absolute difference, 14.95 mg/dL; 95% CI,
3.91-25.99 mg/dL; P = .008) were both significantly better 5
years after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (Table 4).

the sleeve gastrectomy group (14/44 [31.8%] vs 3/48 [6.3%];
absolute difference, 0.36%; 95% CI, 0.13%-0.59%; P = .006).

had an obstruction of the biliopancreatic limb. One patient had
a leakage at the gastrojejunostomy with a complicated course,
which eventually led to multiorgan failure and death.
Late Complications
Fifteen (14.9%) of 101 patients in the sleeve gastrectomy group
and 18 (17.3%) of 104 in the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass group re-
quired additional surgical or endoscopic interventions from
postoperative day 30 through 5-year follow-up (absolute dif-
ference,−0.05%;95%CI,−0.25%to0.16%;P = .77,uncorrected
for multiple comparisons). In the sleeve gastrectomy group, 9
patientsunderwentconversiontoRoux-en-Ygastricbypassbe-

 pouch resizing. Furthermore, 3 patients experienced severe
dumping and underwent reoperation, twice by pouch revision
and once by bypass reversal. In addition, 1 patient needed in-
cisional hernia repair, and in another patient laparoscopy was
performedforendoscopicaccesstothegastricremnant.Weight
loss to below a BMI of 18, hypoalbuminemia, and life-
threatening complications or deaths associated with the inter-
ventions did not occur up to 5 years after surgery. In total (early
and late complications), 16 patients in the sleeve gastrectomy
groupand23intheRoux-en-Ygastricbypassgrouprequiredre-
visions(absolutedifference,−0.10%;95%CI,−0.29%to0.09%;
P = .33) (Table 5).
Post Hoc Outcomes
All P values reported under post hoc outcomes are uncor-
rected for multiple comparisons because comparisons were
made only for baseline vs 5 years.
The percentage of patients with a percentage excess BMI
loss greater than 50% at 5 years was 68.3% in the sleeve gas-
trectomy group and 76% in the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass group
(absolutedifference,−0.1%;95%CI,−0.26%to0.07%;P = .28).
A percentage excess BMI loss greater than 75% was observed in
31.7% vs 40.4%, respectively (absolute difference, 0.09%; 95%
CI,−0.06%to0.25%;P = .21).ApercentageexcessBMIlossless
than 25% was observed in 9.9% of sleeve gastrectomy patients
and 3.8% of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patients (absolute differ-
ence, −0.24%; 95% CI, −0.52% to 0.05%; P = .10).
Mean BMI decreased significantly from baseline to 5 years
after operation (in the sleeve gastrectomy group, from 43.5 to
32.5, and in the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass group, from 44.3
to 31.6; P < .001 for both groups). There was no significant dif-
ference in BMI at 5 years between the interventions (absolute
difference, 0.91; 95% CI, −0.77 to 2.6; P = .29). Mean weight re-
duction was not significantly different between the groups at
5 years (sleeve gastrectomy, 33.0 kg, vs Roux-en-Y gastric by-
pass, 36.6 kg; absolute difference, 3.6 kg; 95% CI, −1.8 kg
to 9.0 kg; P = .19). In both groups, weight loss nadir was
reached between 1 and 2 years after surgery (eFigure 1 in
Supplement 2). Mean weight loss expressed as percentage of
original weight loss was lower in the sleeve gastrectomy group
vs the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass group at 5 years (sleeve gas-
trectomy, 25.0%, vs Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, 28.6%; abso-
lute difference, −3.7%; 95% CI, −6.7% to −0.6%; P = .02) (eFig-
ure 2 in Supplement 2).
Discussion
In this trial including 217 morbidly obese patients randomized
to undergo either laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy or
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, no significant difference in percent-
age excess BMI loss was found 5 years after surgery in analyses
that adjusted for multiple comparisons. Furthermore,
obesity-associated comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes
anddyslipidemia,werereducedafterbothprocedures,withthe
exception of gastroesophageal reflux disease, which was
achieved more often after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. More-
over, worsening of reflux symptoms was found more fre-
quently in patients who underwent sleeve gastrectomy. There
was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups
in the increase of quality of life or in the number of reopera-
tions or interventions.
This trial did not detect a statistically significant differ-
ence in weight loss when measured as percentage excess BMI
loss, which is in contrast to 2 recent meta-analyses comparing
the 2 interventions, both of which found greater weight loss
with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.20,21 However, both meta-
analysesincludedmainlynonrandomizedstudieswithoutap-
propriatecontrols,andinmoststudies,definitionsforthereso-
lution of comorbidities were not reported. Also, the few
randomized studies that were included had either a shorter
follow-up time or included fewer patients compared with the
current trial. When this study was designed, it was common
to report outcomes from bariatric surgery as percentage ex-
cess weight or BMI loss. In recent years, the preferred means
of reporting weight loss following bariatric surgery is percent-
age weight loss relative to original body weight.22 In this trial,

 original body weight at 5 years revealed less weight loss with
sleeve gastrectomy relative to that achieved by Roux-en-Y
gastric bypass. Although statistically significant, these differ-
ences were small and not clinically important.
No statistically significant difference in remission rates of
type 2 diabetes could be shown in this trial. While bariatric sur-
geryisrecognizedasapotenttreatmentoptioninpatientswith
obesity and type 2 diabetes, differences between the avail-
able interventions in the efficiency to improve glycemic con-
trol in patients with and without type 2 diabetes are still un-
clear, as a certain gradient of efficiency among the surgical
interventionshasbeenreportedinseveraltrials.23Overall,mal-
absorptive biliopancreatic diversion has been shown to be the
most efficient operation in terms of type 2 diabetes remission
rates (but the most radical in terms of potentially severe ad-
verseeffects),followedbyRoux-en-Ygastricbypass,sleevegas-
trectomy, and gastric banding.24 However, when comparing
sleevegastrectomywithRoux-en-Ygastricbypassheadtohead,
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass appears superior for diabetes remis-
sion rates, at least in the long term.4,25-29 For example, the
STAMPEDE trial compared best medical treatment vs sleeve
gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass over a period of
5 years. Although no statistically significant difference be-
tween the 2 surgical groups was found for the primary end
point of hemoglobin A1c of less than 6.0%, other end points,
such as the number of antidiabetic medications, showed su-
periority of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass vs sleeve gastrectomy.4
A similar outcome in terms of glycemic control in patients with
type 2 diabetes was also reported in 2 recent meta-analyses,
includingrandomizedtrialscomparingsleevegastrectomywith
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass only.26,29
Patients with severe, preexisting gastroesophageal reflux
disease and large hiatal hernia were not included in the
study, as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is generally regarded as
superior to sleeve gastrectomy in these cases. Nevertheless,
many patients with morbid obesity experience intermittent
gastroesophageal reflux, which can exacerbate after sleeve
gastrectomy. In this trial, preexisting gastroesophageal
reflux disease was found to be significantly better treated by
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass compared with sleeve gastrectomy.
Moreover, worsening of reflux symptoms was more often
seen after sleeve gastrectomy, and patients with no gastro-
esophageal reflux disease at baseline more often reported de
novo reflux symptoms 5 years after sleeve gastrectomy than
after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. In most cases, gastroesopha-
geal reflux symptoms could be treated conservatively with
proton pump inhibitors. However, in nearly 10% of patients,
pharmaceutical treatment was insufficient and sleeve gas-
trectomy had to be converted to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass
despite that during primary intervention, hiatal hernias had
always been repaired.16
Bariatric surgery is associated with a higher risk of rein-
terventions than other types of surgeries. In addition, re-
cently published reports indicate development of Barrett mu-
cosa after sleeve gastrectomy in up to 17% of asymptomatic
patients.30,31 Depending on the grade of dysplasia and the
length of the Barrett segment, the incidence of Barrett carci-
noma ranges from 0.3% to 2.4% per year.32 Longer follow-up
is needed to address the issue of gastroesophageal reflux
disease and Barrett esophagus, with endoscopic surveillance
potentially needed in long-term follow-up. Thus, recommend-
ing sleeve gastrectomy to every patient because it seems safer,
with less perioperative morbidity and no difference in mor-
bidity up to 5 years, may be shortsighted.
Quality of life improved significantly after both proce-
duresateachtimepointcomparedwithbaseline(Table4),with

 There also was no significant difference in complications
necessitating surgical or endoscopic revision within the
first 5 years postoperatively. The most frequent reason for
reoperation after sleeve gastrectomy was gastroesophageal
reflux disease, followed by insufficient weight loss. After
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, the most frequent reinterventions
were for internal hernia in almost 10% of patients, a poten-
tially dangerous complication. In this trial, the rate of internal
hernia was rather high, which may be due to the fact that clo-
sure of mesenteric defects was not mandatory in the study
protocol. According to recent evidence, the incidence of
internal hernias after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass can possibly
be reduced by closure of all mesenteric defects.33,34 Other
causes for reoperation after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass were
late dumping or small bowel obstruction, complications
that rarely occur after sleeve gastrectomy. Thus, the types of
complications are different, but the frequency is not statisti-
cally different.
This study has several limitations. First, the study is un-
derpowered for the exploratory end point of type 2 diabetes
remission. Although no significant differences were found be-
tweenthe2proceduresregardingtheirantidiabeticeffects,this
trial does not allow for firm conclusions on the absence of dif-
ferences.Second,becauserandomizedtrialsareconductedun-
der idealized and rigorously controlled conditions, their gen-
eralizability might be compromised. The willingness to
participate in a randomized trial might per se also lead to pa-
tient selection bias. However, the study outcomes are in line
with outcomes seen in unselected bariatric cohorts and can be
considered to be generalizable.
In addition, the protocol did not include an upper limit for
BMI, and there were a few patients with BMI above 60 in both
groups. This trial cannot answer the question whether pa-
tients with extremely high BMI may have greater benefit from
a staged concept with initial sleeve gastrectomy followed
by Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or biliopancreatic diversion.

operations have specific complications (eg, internal hernia,
which is only possible after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass) and phy-
siciansinchargeaswellaspatientsmustknowwhatkindofop-
eration was carried out. In our opinion, blinding would have
been unethical.
Conclusions
Among patients with morbid obesity, there was no signifi-
cant difference in excess BMI loss between laparoscopic sleeve
gastrectomy and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass at 5
years of follow-up after surgery.
