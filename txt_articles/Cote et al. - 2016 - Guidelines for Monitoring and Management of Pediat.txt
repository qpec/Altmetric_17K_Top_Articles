abstract
The safe sedation of children for procedures requires a systematic 
approach that includes the following: no administration of sedating 
medication without the safety net of medical/dental supervision, careful 
presedation evaluation for underlying medical or surgical conditions 
that would place the child at increased risk from sedating medications, 
appropriate fasting for elective procedures and a balance between the 
depth of sedation and risk for those who are unable to fast because of the 
urgent nature of the procedure, a focused airway examination for large 
(kissing) tonsils or anatomic airway abnormalities that might increase the 
potential for airway obstruction, a clear understanding of the medication’s 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects and drug interactions, 
appropriate training and skills in airway management to allow rescue of 
the patient, age- and size-appropriate equipment for airway management 
and venous access, appropriate medications and reversal agents, suffi
 cient 
numbers of staff to both carry out the procedure and monitor the patient, 
appropriate physiologic monitoring during and after the procedure, a 
properly equipped and staffed recovery area, recovery to the presedation 
level of consciousness before discharge from medical/dental supervision, 
and appropriate discharge instructions. This report was developed 
through a collaborative effort of the American Academy of Pediatrics and 
the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry to offer pediatric providers 
updated information and guidance in delivering safe sedation to children.

INTRODUCTION
The number of diagnostic and minor 
surgical procedures performed on 
pediatric patients outside of the 
traditional operating room setting 
has increased in the past several 
decades. As a consequence of this 
change and the increased awareness 
of the importance of providing 
analgesia and anxiolysis, the need for 
sedation for procedures in physicians’ 
offices, dental offices, subspecialty 
procedure suites, imaging facilities, 
emergency departments, other 
inpatient hospital settings, and 
ambulatory surgery centers also 
has increased markedly.1–52 In 
recognition of this need for both 
elective and emergency use of 
sedation in nontraditional settings, 
the American Academy of Pediatrics 
(AAP) and the American Academy 
of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) have 
published a series of guidelines for 
the monitoring and management of 
pediatric patients during and after 
sedation for a procedure.53–58 The 
purpose of this updated report is to 
unify the guidelines for sedation used 
by medical and dental practitioners; 
to add clarifications regarding 
monitoring modalities, particularly 
regarding continuous expired carbon 
dioxide measurement; to provide 
updated information from the medical 
and dental literature; and to suggest 
methods for further improvement in 
safety and outcomes. This document 
uses the same language to define 
sedation categories and expected 
physiologic responses as The Joint 
Commission, the American Society 
of Anesthesiologists (ASA), and the 
AAPD.56, 
57, 
59–61
This revised statement reflects 
the current understanding of 
appropriate monitoring needs of 
pediatric patients both during and 
after sedation for a procedure.3,

 The 
monitoring and care outlined 
may be exceeded at any time on 
the basis of the judgment of the 
responsible practitioner. Although 
intended to encourage high-quality 
patient care, adherence to the 
recommendations in this document 
cannot guarantee a specific patient 
outcome. However, structured 
sedation protocols designed to 
incorporate these safety principles 
have been widely implemented and 
shown to reduce morbidity.11, 
23, 
24, 
27, 
30–33, 
35, 
39, 
41, 
44, 
47, 
51, 
74–84 These practice 
recommendations are proffered 
with the awareness that, regardless 
of the intended level of sedation 
or route of drug administration, 
the sedation of a pediatric patient 
represents a continuum and may 
result in respiratory depression, 
laryngospasm, impaired airway 
patency, apnea, loss of the patient’s 
protective airway reflexes, and 
cardiovascular instability.38, 
43, 
45, 
47, 
48, 
59, 
62,

Procedural sedation of pediatric 
patients has serious associated 
risks.2, 
5, 
38, 
43, 
45, 
47, 
48, 
62, 
63, 
71, 
83, 
85, 
88–105, 
107–138 These adverse responses 
during and after sedation for a 
diagnostic or therapeutic procedure 
may be minimized, but not 
completely eliminated, by a careful 
preprocedure review of the patient’s 
underlying medical conditions and 
consideration of how the sedation 
process might affect or be affected 
by these conditions: for example, 
children with developmental 
disabilities have been shown to have 
a threefold increased incidence of 
desaturation compared with 
children without developmental 
disabilities.74, 
78, 
103 Appropriate drug 
selection for the intended procedure, 
a clear understanding of the sedating 
medication’s pharmacokinetics 
and pharmacodynamics and drug 
interactions, as well as the presence 
of an individual with the skills 
needed to rescue a patient from 
an adverse response are critical.42, 
48, 
62, 
63, 
92, 
97, 
99, 
125–127, 
132, 
133, 
139–158 
Appropriate physiologic monitoring 
and continuous observation by 
personnel not directly involved with 
the procedure allow for the accurate 
and rapid diagnosis of complications 
and initiation of appropriate rescue 
interventions.44, 
63, 
64, 
67, 
68, 
74, 
90, 
96, 
110, 
159–174 
The work of the Pediatric Sedation 
Research Consortium has improved 
the sedation knowledge base, 
demonstrating the marked safety of 
sedation by highly motivated and 
skilled practitioners from a variety 
of specialties practicing the above 
modalities and skills that focus on a 
culture of sedation safety.45, 
83, 
95, 
128–138 
However, these groundbreaking 
studies also show a low but 
persistent rate of potential sedation-
induced life-threatening events, 
such as apnea, airway obstruction, 
laryngospasm, pulmonary aspiration, 
desaturation, and others, even when 
the sedation is provided under the 
direction of a motivated team of 
specialists.129 These studies have 
helped define the skills needed to 
rescue children experiencing adverse 
sedation events.
The sedation of children is different 
from the sedation of adults. Sedation 
in children is often administered to 
relieve pain and anxiety as well as to 
modify behavior (eg, immobility) so 
as to allow the safe completion of a 
procedure. A child’s ability to control 
his or her own behavior to cooperate 
for a procedure depends both on his 
or her chronologic age and cognitive/
emotional development. Many brief 
procedures, such as suture of a minor 
laceration, may be accomplished 
with distraction and guided imagery 
techniques, along with the use 
of topical/local anesthetics and 
minimal sedation, if needed.175–181 
However, longer procedures that 
require immobility involving children 
younger than 6 years or those with 
developmental delay often require an 
increased depth of sedation to gain 
control of their behavior.86, 
87, 
103 
Children younger than 6 years 
(particularly those younger than 6 
months) may be at greatest risk of 
an adverse event.129 Children in this 
age group are particularly vulnerable

to the sedating medication’s effects 
on respiratory drive, airway patency, 
and protective airway reflexes.62, 
63 
Other modalities, such as careful 
preparation, parental presence, 
hypnosis, distraction, topical local 
anesthetics, electronic devices with 
age-appropriate games or videos, 
guided imagery, and the techniques 
advised by child life specialists, may 
reduce the need for or the needed 
depth of pharmacologic 
sedation.29, 
46, 
49, 
182–211
Studies have shown that it is 
common for children to pass from 
the intended level of sedation to 
a deeper, unintended level of 
sedation, 
85, 
88, 
212, 
213 making the 
concept of rescue essential to safe 
sedation. Practitioners of sedation 
must have the skills to rescue the 
patient from a deeper level than 
that intended for the procedure. 
For example, if the intended level of 
sedation is “minimal, 
” practitioners 
must be able to rescue from 
“moderate sedation”; if the intended 
level of sedation is “moderate, 
” 
practitioners must have the skills to 
rescue from “deep sedation”; if the 
intended level of sedation is “deep, 
” 
practitioners must have the skills 
to rescue from a state of “general 
anesthesia.” The ability to rescue 
means that practitioners must be 
able to recognize the various levels 
of sedation and have the skills and 
age- and size-appropriate equipment 
necessary to provide appropriate 
cardiopulmonary support if needed.
These guidelines are intended 
for all venues in which sedation 
for a procedure might be 
performed (hospital, surgical 
center, freestanding imaging 
facility, dental facility, or private 
office). Sedation and anesthesia 
in a nonhospital environment (eg, 
private physician’s or dental office, 
freestanding imaging facility) 
historically have been associated 
with an increased incidence of 
“failure to rescue” from adverse 
events, because these settings may 
lack immediately available backup. 
Immediate activation of emergency 
medical services (EMS) may be 
required in such settings, but the 
practitioner is responsible for life-
support measures while awaiting 
EMS arrival.63, 
214 Rescue techniques 
require specific training and 
skills.63, 
74, 
215, 
216 The maintenance 
of the skills needed to rescue a child 
with apnea, laryngospasm, and/or 
airway obstruction include the 
ability to open the airway, suction 
secretions, provide continuous 
positive airway pressure (CPAP), 
perform successful bag-valve-mask 
ventilation, insert an oral airway, 
a nasopharyngeal airway, or a 
laryngeal mask airway (LMA), 
and, rarely, perform tracheal 
intubation. These skills are likely 
best maintained with frequent 
simulation and team training 
for the management of rare 
events.128, 
130, 
217–220 Competency 
with emergency airway management 
procedure algorithms is fundamental 
for safe sedation practice and 
successful patient rescue (see 
Figs 1, 2, and 3).215, 
216, 
221–223
Practitioners should have an 
in-depth knowledge of the 
agents they intend to use and 
their potential complications. A 
number of reviews and handbooks 
for sedating pediatric patients are 
available.30, 
39, 
65, 
75, 
171, 
172, 
201, 
224–233 
There are specific situations that are 
beyond the scope of this document. 
Specifically, guidelines for the 
delivery of general anesthesia and 
monitored anesthesia care (sedation 
or analgesia), outside or within the 
operating room by anesthesiologists 
or other practitioners functioning 
within a department of 
anesthesiology, are addressed 
by policies developed by the ASA 
and by individual departments 
of anesthesiology.234 In addition, 
guidelines for the sedation of patients 
undergoing mechanical ventilation 
in a critical care environment or 
for providing analgesia for patients 
postoperatively, patients with 
chronic painful conditions, and 
patients in hospice care are beyond 
the scope of this document.

GOALS OF SEDATION
The goals of sedation in the pediatric 
patient for diagnostic and therapeutic 
procedures are as follows: (1) 
to guard the patient’s safety and 
welfare; (2) to minimize physical 
discomfort and pain; (3) to control 
anxiety, minimize psychological 
trauma, and maximize the potential 
for amnesia; (4) to modify behavior 
and/or movement so as to allow the 
safe completion of the procedure; and 
(5) to return the patient to a state in 
which discharge from medical/dental 
supervision is safe, as determined by 
recognized criteria (Supplemental 
Appendix 1).
These goals can best be achieved 
by selecting the lowest dose of drug 
with the highest therapeutic index 
for the procedure. It is beyond the 
scope of this document to specify 
which drugs are appropriate for 
which procedures; however, the 
selection of the fewest number of 
drugs and matching drug selection to 
the type and goals of the procedure 
are essential for safe practice. For 
example, analgesic medications, 
such as opioids or ketamine, are 
indicated for painful procedures. 
For nonpainful procedures, such as 
computed tomography or magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI), sedatives/
hypnotics are preferred. When both 
sedation and analgesia are desirable 
(eg, fracture reduction), either single 
agents with analgesic/sedative 
properties or combination regimens 
are commonly used. Anxiolysis and 
amnesia are additional goals that 
should be considered in the selection 
of agents for particular patients. 
However, the potential for an adverse 
outcome may be increased when 2 
or more sedating medications are 
administered.62, 
127, 
136, 
173, 
235 Recently, 
there has been renewed interest in 
noninvasive routes of medication 
administration, including intranasal 
and inhaled routes (eg, nitrous oxide; 
see below).236
Knowledge of each drug’s time of 
onset, peak response, and duration 
of action is important (eg, the 
peak electroencephalogram [EEG] 
effect of intravenous midazolam 
occurs at ∼4.8 minutes, compared 
with that of diazepam at ∼1.6 
minutes237–239). Titration of drug 
to effect is an important concept;

one must know whether the 
previous dose has taken full effect 
before administering additional 
drugs.237 Drugs that have a long 
duration of action (eg, intramuscular 
pentobarbital, phenothiazines) 
have fallen out of favor because 
of unpredictable responses and 
prolonged recovery. The use of 
these drugs requires a longer period 
of observation even after the child 
achieves currently used recovery 
and discharge criteria.62, 
238–241 
This concept is particularly 
important for infants and toddlers 
transported in car safety seats; 
re-sedation after discharge 
attributable to residual prolonged 
drug effects may lead to airway 
obstruction.62, 
63, 
242 In particular, 
promethazine (Phenergan; Wyeth 
Pharmaceuticals, Philadelphia, 
PA) has a “black box warning” 
regarding fatal respiratory 
depression in children younger 
than 2 years.243 Although the liquid 
formulation of chloral hydrate is 
no longer commercially available, 
some hospital pharmacies now 
are compounding their own 
formulations. Low-dose chloral 
hydrate (10–25 mg/kg), in 
combination with other sedating 
medications, is used commonly in 
pediatric dental practice.
GENERAL GUIDELINES
Candidates
Patients who are in ASA classes I 
and II are frequently considered 
appropriate candidates for 
minimal, moderate, or deep sedation 
(Supplemental Appendix 2). 
Children in ASA classes III and 
IV, children with special needs, 
and those with anatomic airway 
abnormalities or moderate to severe 
tonsillar hypertrophy present 
issues that require additional 
and individual consideration, 
particularly for moderate and deep 
sedation.68, 
244–249 Practitioners 
are encouraged to consult with 
appropriate subspecialists and/
or an anesthesiologist for patients 
at increased risk of experiencing 
adverse sedation events because of 
their underlying medical/surgical 
conditions.
Responsible Person
The pediatric patient shall be 
accompanied to and from the 
treatment facility by a parent, legal 
guardian, or other responsible 
person. It is preferable to have 
2 adults accompany children 
who are still in car safety seats 
if transportation to and from a 
treatment facility is provided by 1 of 
the adults.250
Facilities
The practitioner who uses sedation 
must have immediately available 
facilities, personnel, and equipment 
to manage emergency and rescue 
situations. The most common 
serious complications of sedation 
involve compromise of the airway or 
depressed respirations resulting in 
airway obstruction, hypoventilation, 
laryngospasm, hypoxemia, and apnea. 
Hypotension and cardiopulmonary 
arrest may occur, usually from 
the inadequate recognition 
and treatment of respiratory 
compromise.42, 
48, 
92, 
97, 
99, 
125, 
132, 
139–155, 
 
Other rare complications also may 
include seizures, vomiting, and 
allergic reactions. Facilities providing 
pediatric sedation should monitor 
for, and be prepared to treat, such 
complications.
Back-up Emergency Services
A protocol for immediate access 
to back-up emergency services 
shall be clearly outlined. For 
nonhospital facilities, a protocol 
for the immediate activation of the 
EMS system for life-threatening 
complications must be established 
and maintained.44 It should be 
understood that the availability 
of EMS does not replace the 
practitioner’s responsibility to 
provide initial rescue for life-
threatening complications.
On-site Monitoring, Rescue Drugs, 
and Equipment
An emergency cart or kit must be 
immediately accessible. This cart or 
kit must contain the necessary age- 
and size-appropriate equipment (oral 
and nasal airways, bag-valve-mask 
device, LMAs or other supraglottic 
devices, laryngoscope blades, 
tracheal tubes, face masks, blood 
pressure cuffs, intravenous catheters, 
etc) to resuscitate a nonbreathing 
and unconscious child. The contents 
of the kit must allow for the provision 
of continuous life support while the 
patient is being transported to a 
medical/dental facility or to another 
area within the facility. All equipment 
and drugs must be checked and 
maintained on a scheduled basis 
(see Supplemental Appendices 
3 and 4 for suggested drugs and 
emergency life support equipment 
to consider before the need for 
rescue occurs). Monitoring devices, 
such as electrocardiography (ECG) 
machines, pulse oximeters with size-
appropriate probes, end-tidal carbon 
dioxide monitors, and defibrillators 
with size-appropriate patches/
paddles, must have a safety and 
function check on a regular basis as 
required by local or state regulation. 
The use of emergency checklists is 
recommended, and these should be 
immediately available at all sedation 
locations; they can be obtained from

Documentation
Documentation prior to sedation 
shall include, but not be limited to, 
the following recommendations:
1. Informed consent: The patient 
record shall document that 
appropriate informed consent 
was obtained according to 
local, state, and institutional 
requirements.251, 
252
2. Instructions and information 
provided to the responsible 
e5

 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
person: The practitioner shall 
provide verbal and/or written 
instructions to the responsible 
person. Information shall 
include objectives of the sedation 
and anticipated changes in 
behavior during and after 
sedation.163, 
253–255 Special 
instructions shall be given 
to the adult responsible for 
infants and toddlers who will 
be transported home in a car 
safety seat regarding the need 
to carefully observe the child’s 
head position to avoid airway 
obstruction. Transportation in a 
car safety seat poses a particular 
risk for infants who have received 
medications known to have a long 
half-life, such as chloral hydrate, 
intramuscular pentobarbital, or 
phenothiazine because deaths 
after procedural sedation have 
been reported.62, 
63, 
238, 
242, 
256, 
257 
Consideration for a longer period 
of observation shall be given if 
the responsible person’s ability 
to observe the child is limited 
(eg, only 1 adult who also has 
to drive). Another indication for 
prolonged observation would be 
a child with an anatomic airway 
problem, an underlying medical 
condition such as significant 
obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), or 
a former preterm infant younger 
than 60 weeks’ postconceptional 
age. A 24-hour telephone number 
for the practitioner or his or her 
associates shall be provided to 
all patients and their families. 
Instructions shall include 
limitations of activities and 
appropriate dietary precautions.
Dietary Precautions
Agents used for sedation have the 
potential to impair protective airway 
reflexes, particularly during deep 
sedation. Although a rare occurrence, 
pulmonary aspiration may occur if 
the child regurgitates and cannot 
protect his or her airway.95, 
127, 
258 
Therefore, the practitioner should 
evaluate preceding food and fluid 
intake before administering sedation. 
It is likely that the risk of aspiration 
during procedural sedation differs 
from that during general anesthesia 
involving tracheal intubation or 
other airway manipulations.259, 
260 
However, the absolute risk of 
aspiration during elective procedural 
sedation is not yet known; the reported 
incidence varies from ∼1 in 825 to ∼1 
in 30 037.95, 
127, 
129, 
173, 
244, 
261 Therefore, 
standard practice for fasting before 
elective sedation generally follows 
the same guidelines as for elective 
general anesthesia; this requirement 
is particularly important for solids, 
because aspiration of clear gastric 
contents causes less pulmonary 
injury than aspiration of particulate 
gastric contents.262, 
263
For emergency procedures in 
children undergoing general 
anesthesia, the reported incidence 
of pulmonary aspiration of gastric 
contents from 1 institution is 
∼1 in 373 compared with ∼1 in 
4544 for elective anesthetics.262 
Because there are few published 
studies with adequate statistical 
power to provide guidance to the 
practitioner regarding the safety 
or risk of pulmonary aspiration of 
gastric contents during procedural 
sedation, 
95, 
127, 
129, 
173, 
244, 
259–261, 
264–268, 
 
it is unknown whether the risk of 
aspiration is reduced when airway 
manipulation is not performed/
anticipated (eg, moderate sedation). 
However, if a deeply sedated child 
requires intervention for airway 
obstruction, apnea, or laryngospasm, 
there is concern that these rescue 
maneuvers could increase the risk 
of pulmonary aspiration of gastric 
contents. For children requiring 
urgent/emergent sedation who do 
not meet elective fasting guidelines, 
the risks of sedation and possible 
aspiration are as-yet unknown 
and must be balanced against the 
benefits of performing the procedure 
promptly. For example, a prudent 
practitioner would be unlikely 
to administer deep sedation to a 
child with a minor condition who 
just ate a large meal; conversely, 
it is not justifiable to withhold 
sedation/analgesia from the child 
in significant pain from a displaced 
fracture who had a small snack a few 
hours earlier. Several emergency 
department studies have reported a 
low to zero incidence of pulmonary 
aspiration despite variable fasting 
periods260, 
264, 
268; however, each 
of these reports has, for the most 
part, clearly balanced the urgency 
of the procedure with the need 
for and depth of sedation.268, 
269 
Although emergency medicine 
studies and practice guidelines 
generally support a less restrictive 
approach to fasting for brief urgent/
emergent procedures, such as care of 
wounds, joint dislocation, chest tube 
placement, etc, in healthy children, 
further research in many thousands 
of patients would be desirable to 
better define the relationships 
between various fasting intervals and 
sedation complications.262–270
Before Elective Sedation
Children undergoing sedation for 
elective procedures generally should 
follow the same fasting guidelines 
as those for general anesthesia 
(Table 1).271 It is permissible for 
routine necessary medications (eg, 
antiseizure medications) to be taken 
with a sip of clear liquid or water on 
the day of the procedure.
For the Emergency Patient
The practitioner must always 
balance the possible risks of sedating 
nonfasted patients with the benefits 
of and necessity for completing the 
procedure. In particular, patients 
with a history of recent oral intake 
or with other known risk factors, 
such as trauma, decreased level of 
consciousness, extreme obesity (BMI 
≥95% for age and sex), pregnancy, 
or bowel motility dysfunction, 
require careful evaluation before the

the increased risks of sedation must 
be carefully weighed against its 
benefits, and the lightest effective 
sedation should be used. In this 
circumstance, additional techniques 
for achieving analgesia and patient 
cooperation, such as distraction, 
guided imagery, video games, topical 
and local anesthetics, hematoma block 
or nerve blocks, and other techniques 
advised by child life specialists, are 
particularly helpful and should be 
considered.29, 
49, 
182–201, 
 274, 
275
The use of agents with less risk 
of depressing protective airway 
reflexes, such as ketamine, or 
moderate sedation, which would also 
maintain protective reflexes, may 
be preferred.276 Some emergency 
patients requiring deep sedation 
(eg, a trauma patient who just 
ate a full meal or a child with a 
bowel obstruction) may need to be 
intubated to protect their airway 
before they can be sedated.
Use of Immobilization Devices 
(Protective Stabilization)
Immobilization devices, such 
as papoose boards, must be 
applied in such a way as to avoid 
airway obstruction or chest 
restriction.277–281 The child’s head 
position and respiratory excursions 
should be checked frequently 
to ensure airway patency. If an 
immobilization device is used, a 
hand or foot should be kept exposed, 
and the child should never be left 
unattended. If sedating medications 
are administered in conjunction with 
an immobilization device, monitoring 
must be used at a level consistent 
with the level of sedation achieved.
Documentation at the Time of 
Sedation
1. Health evaluation: Before sedation, 
a health evaluation shall be performed 
by an appropriately licensed 
practitioner and reviewed by the 
sedation team at the time of treatment 
for possible interval changes.282 The 
purpose of this evaluation is not 
only to document baseline status 
but also to determine whether the 
patient has specific risk factors that 
may warrant additional consultation 
before sedation. This evaluation 
also facilitates the identification 
of patients who will require more 
advanced airway or cardiovascular 
management skills or alterations in 
the doses or types of medications 
used for procedural sedation.
An important concern for the 
practitioner is the widespread 
use of medications that may 
interfere with drug absorption or 
metabolism and therefore enhance 
or shorten the effect time of sedating 
medications. Herbal medicines 
(eg, St John’s wort, ginkgo, ginger, 
ginseng, garlic) may alter drug 
pharmacokinetics through inhibition 
of the cytochrome P450 system, 
resulting in prolonged drug effect 
and altered (increased or decreased) 
blood drug concentrations 
(midazolam, cyclosporine, 
tacrolimus).283–292 Kava may 
increase the effects of sedatives 
by potentiating γ-aminobutyric 
acid inhibitory neurotransmission 
and may increase acetaminophen-
induced liver toxicity.293–295 Valerian 
may itself produce sedation that 
apparently is mediated through the 
modulation of γ-aminobutyric acid 
neurotransmission and receptor 
function.291, 
296–299 Drugs such as 
erythromycin, cimetidine, and others 
may also inhibit the cytochrome 
P450 system, resulting in prolonged 
sedation with midazolam as well as 
other medications competing for 
the same enzyme systems.300–304 
Medications used to treat HIV 
infection, some anticonvulsants, 
immunosuppressive drugs, and 
some psychotropic medications 
(often used to treat children with 
autism spectrum disorder) may also 
produce clinically important drug-
drug interactions.305–314 Therefore, 
a careful drug history is a vital part 
of the safe sedation of children. The 
practitioner should consult various 
sources (a pharmacist, textbooks, 
online services, or handheld 
databases) for specific information 
on drug interactions.315–319 The 
US Food and Drug Administration 
issued a warning in February 2013 
regarding the use of codeine for 
postoperative pain management in 
children undergoing tonsillectomy, 
particularly those with OSA. The 
safety issue is that some children 
have duplicated cytochromes 
that allow greater than expected 
conversion of the prodrug codeine to 
morphine, thus resulting in potential 
overdose; codeine should be avoided 
for postprocedure analgesia.320–324
The health evaluation should include 
the following:
 
• age and weight (in kg) and 
gestational age at birth (preterm 
infants may have associated

syndrome, Marfan syndrome,

conditions; (4) pregnancy status 
(as many as 1% of menarchal 
females presenting for general 
anesthesia at children’s hospitals 
are pregnant)329–331 because of con-
cerns for the potential adverse effects 
of most sedating and anesthetic 
drugs on the fetus329, 
332–338; 
(5) history of prematurity (may

anesthesia and any complications 
or unexpected responses; and 
(9) relevant family history, 
particularly related to anesthesia 
(eg, muscular dystrophy, 
malignant hyperthermia, 
pseudocholinesterase deficiency).
The review of systems should 
focus on abnormalities of cardiac, 
pulmonary, renal, or hepatic 
function that might alter the 
child’s expected responses to 
sedating/analgesic medications. 
A specific query regarding signs 
and symptoms of sleep-disordered 
breathing and OSA may be helpful. 
Children with severe OSA who have 
experienced repeated episodes 
of desaturation will likely have 
altered mu receptors and be 
analgesic at opioid levels one-third 
to one-half those of a child without 
OSA325–328, 
339, 
340; lower titrated 
doses of opioids should be used 
in this population. Such a detailed 
history will help to determine which 
patients may benefit from a higher 
level of care by an appropriately 
skilled health care provider, such 
as an anesthesiologist. The health 
evaluation should also include:
 
• vital signs, including heart rate, 
blood pressure, respiratory rate, 
room air oxygen saturation, 
and temperature (for some 
children who are very upset or 
noncooperative, this may not 
be possible and a note should 
be written to document this 
circumstance);
 
• physical examination, including 
a focused evaluation of the 
airway (tonsillar hypertrophy, 
abnormal anatomy [eg, mandibular 
hypoplasia], high Mallampati score 
[ie, ability to visualize only the 
hard palate or tip of the uvula]) 
to determine whether there 
is an increased risk of airway 
obstruction74, 
341–344;
 
• physical status evaluation (ASA 
classification [see Appendix 2]); 
and
 
• name, address, and telephone 
number of the child’s home or 
parent’s, or caregiver’s cell phone; 
additional information such as the 
patient’s personal care provider or 
medical home is also encouraged.
For hospitalized patients, the 
current hospital record may suffice 
for adequate documentation of 
presedation health; however, a note 
shall be written documenting that the 
chart was reviewed, positive findings 
were noted, and a management plan 
was formulated. If the clinical or 
emergency condition of the patient 
precludes acquiring complete 
information before sedation, this 
health evaluation should be obtained 
as soon as feasible.
2. Prescriptions. When prescriptions 
are used for sedation, a copy of the 
prescription or a note describing the 
content of the prescription should 
be in the patient’s chart along with a 
description of the instructions that 
were given to the responsible person. 
Prescription medications intended 
to accomplish procedural sedation 
must not be administered without 
the safety net of direct supervision 
by trained medical/dental 
personnel. The administration of 
sedating medications at home poses 
an unacceptable risk, particularly for 
infants and preschool-aged children 
traveling in car safety seats because 
deaths as a result of this practice 
have been reported.63, 
257
Documentation During Treatment
The patient’s chart shall contain 
a time-based record that includes 
the name, route, site, time, dosage/
kilogram, and patient effect of 
administered drugs. Before sedation, 
a “time out” should be performed 
to confirm the patient’s name, 
procedure to be performed, and 
laterality and site of the procedure.59 
During administration, the inspired 
concentrations of oxygen and 
inhalation sedation agents and the 
duration of their administration 
shall be documented. Before drug 
administration, special attention 
must be paid to the calculation 
of dosage (ie, mg/kg); for obese 
patients, most drug doses should 
likely be adjusted lower to ideal body 
weight rather than actual weight.345 
When a programmable pump is 
used for the infusion of sedating 
medications, the dose/kilogram per 
minute or hour and the child’s weight 
in kilograms should be double-
checked and confirmed by a separate 
individual. The patient’s chart shall 
contain documentation at the time of 
treatment that the patient’s level of 
consciousness and responsiveness, 
heart rate, blood pressure, 
respiratory rate, expired carbon 
dioxide values, and oxygen saturation

were monitored. Standard vital 
signs should be further documented 
at appropriate intervals during 
recovery until the patient attains 
predetermined discharge criteria 
(Appendix 1). A variety of sedation 
scoring systems are available that 
may aid this process.212, 
238, 
346–348 
Adverse events and their treatment 
shall be documented.
Documentation After Treatment
A dedicated and properly equipped 
recovery area is recommended (see 
Appendices 3 and 4). The time and 
condition of the child at discharge 
from the treatment area or facility 
shall be documented, which should 
include documentation that the 
child’s level of consciousness and 
oxygen saturation in room air have 
returned to a state that is safe for 
discharge by recognized criteria 
(see Appendix 1). Patients receiving 
supplemental oxygen before the 
procedure should have a similar 
oxygen need after the procedure. 
Because some sedation medications 
are known to have a long half-life 
and may delay a patient’s complete 
return to baseline or pose the 
risk of re-sedation62, 
104, 
256, 
349, 
350 
and because some patients will 
have complex multiorgan medical 
conditions, a longer period of 
observation in a less intense 
observation area (eg, a step-down 
observation area) before discharge 
from medical/dental supervision 
may be indicated.239 Several scales to 
evaluate recovery have been devised 
and validated.212, 
346–348, 
351, 
352 A 
simple evaluation tool may be the 
ability of the infant or child to remain 
awake for at least 20 minutes when 
placed in a quiet environment.238
CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT
The essence of medical error 
reduction is a careful examination 
of index events and root-cause 
analysis of how the event could 
be avoided in the future.353–359 
Therefore, each facility should 
maintain records that track all 
adverse events and significant 
interventions, such as desaturation; 
apnea; laryngospasm; need for 
airway interventions, including the 
need for placement of supraglottic 
devices such as an oral airway, 
nasal trumpet, or LMA; positive-
pressure ventilation; prolonged 
sedation; unanticipated use of 
reversal agents; unplanned or 
prolonged hospital admission; 
sedation failures; inability to 
complete the procedure; and 
unsatisfactory sedation, analgesia, 
or anxiolysis.360 Such events 
can then be examined for the 
assessment of risk reduction and 
improvement in patient/family 
satisfaction.
PREPARATION FOR SEDATION 
PROCEDURES
Part of the safety net of sedation is 
using a systematic approach so as 
to not overlook having an important 
drug, piece of equipment, or monitor 
immediately available at the time of 
a developing emergency. To avoid 
this problem, it is helpful to use an 
acronym that allows the same setup 
and checklist for every procedure. 
A commonly used acronym useful 
in planning and preparation for 
a procedure is SOAPME, which 
represents the following:
S = Size-appropriate suction catheters 
and a functioning suction apparatus 
(eg, Yankauer-type suction)
O = an adequate Oxygen supply and 
functioning flow meters or other 
devices to allow its delivery
A = size-appropriate Airway equipment 
(eg, bag-valve-mask or equivalent 
device [functioning]), nasopharyngeal 
and oropharyngeal airways, LMA, 
laryngoscope blades (checked and 
functioning), endotracheal tubes, 
stylets, face mask
P = Pharmacy: all the basic drugs 
needed to support life during an 
emergency, including antagonists 
as indicated
M = Monitors: functioning pulse 
oximeter with size-appropriate 
oximeter probes, 
361, 
362 end-tidal 
carbon dioxide monitor, and other 
monitors as appropriate for the 
procedure (eg, noninvasive blood 
pressure, ECG, stethoscope)
E = special Equipment or drugs for a 
particular case (eg, defibrillator)
SPECIFIC GUIDELINES FOR INTENDED 
LEVEL OF SEDATION
Minimal Sedation
Minimal sedation (old terminology, 
“anxiolysis”) is a drug-induced state 
during which patients respond 
normally to verbal commands. 
Although cognitive function and 
coordination may be impaired, 
ventilatory and cardiovascular 
functions are unaffected. Children 
who have received minimal sedation 
generally will not require more 
than observation and intermittent 
assessment of their level of 
sedation. Some children will become 
moderately sedated despite the 
intended level of minimal sedation; 
should this occur, then the guidelines 
for moderate sedation apply.85, 
363
Moderate Sedation
Moderate sedation (old terminology, 
“conscious sedation” or “sedation/
analgesia”) is a drug-induced 
depression of consciousness during 
which patients respond purposefully 
to verbal commands or after light 
tactile stimulation. No interventions 
are required to maintain a patent 
airway, and spontaneous ventilation 
is adequate. Cardiovascular function is 
usually maintained. The caveat that loss 
of consciousness should be unlikely is 
a particularly important aspect of the 
definition of moderate sedation; drugs 
and techniques used should carry a 
margin of safety wide enough to render 
unintended loss of consciousness 
unlikely. Because the patient who 
e9

 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
receives moderate sedation may 
progress into a state of deep sedation 
and obtundation, the practitioner 
should be prepared to increase the level 
of vigilance corresponding to what is 
necessary for deep sedation.85
Personnel
THE PRACTITIONER. The practitioner 
responsible for the treatment of the 
patient and/or the administration 
of drugs for sedation must be 
competent to use such techniques, 
to provide the level of monitoring 
described in these guidelines, and 
to manage complications of these 
techniques (ie, to be able to rescue 
the patient). Because the level of 
intended sedation may be exceeded, 
the practitioner must be sufficiently 
skilled to rescue a child with apnea, 
laryngospasm, and/or airway 
obstruction, including the ability to 
open the airway, suction secretions, 
provide CPAP, and perform 
successful bag-valve-mask ventilation 
should the child progress to a level 
of deep sedation. Training in, and 
maintenance of, advanced pediatric 
airway skills is required (eg, 
pediatric advanced life support 
[PALS]); regular skills reinforcement 
with simulation is strongly 
encouraged.79, 
80, 
128, 
130, 
217–220, 
 364
SUPPORT PERSONNEL. The use of moderate 
sedation shall include the provision of a 
person, in addition to the practitioner, 
whose responsibility is to monitor 
appropriate physiologic parameters 
and to assist in any supportive or 
resuscitation measures, if required. 
This individual may also be responsible 
for assisting with interruptible 
patient-related tasks of short duration, 
such as holding an instrument or 
troubleshooting equipment.60 This 
individual should be trained in and 
capable of providing advanced airway 
skills (eg, PALS). The support person 
shall have specific assignments in the 
event of an emergency and current 
knowledge of the emergency cart 
inventory. The practitioner and all 
ancillary personnel should participate 
in periodic reviews, simulation of 
rare emergencies, and practice drills 
of the facility’s emergency protocol 
to ensure proper function of the 
equipment and coordination of staff 
roles in such emergencies.133, 
365–367 
It is recommended that at least 1 
practitioner be skilled in obtaining 
vascular access in children.
Monitoring and Documentation
BASELINE. Before the administration 
of sedative medications, a baseline 
determination of vital signs shall be 
documented. For some children who 
are very upset or uncooperative, 
this may not be possible, and a note 
should be written to document this 
circumstance.
DURING THE PROCEDURE The physician/
dentist or his or her designee 
shall document the name, route, 
site, time of administration, and 
dosage of all drugs administered. 
If sedation is being directed by a 
physician who is not personally 
administering the medications, 
then recommended practice is for 
the qualified health care provider 
administering the medication to 
confirm the dose verbally before 
administration. There shall be 
continuous monitoring of oxygen 
saturation and heart rate; when 
bidirectional verbal communication 
between the provider and patient 
is appropriate and possible (ie, 
patient is developmentally able 
and purposefully communicates), 
monitoring of ventilation by 
(1) capnography (preferred) 
or (2) amplified, audible 
pretracheal stethoscope (eg, 
Bluetooth technology)368–371 or 
precordial stethoscope is strongly 
recommended. If bidirectional 
verbal communication is not 
appropriate or not possible, 
monitoring of ventilation by 
capnography (preferred), amplified, 
audible pretracheal stethoscope, or 
precordial stethoscope is required. 
Heart rate, respiratory rate, blood 
pressure, oxygen saturation, and 
expired carbon dioxide values should 
be recorded, at minimum, every 10 
minutes in a time-based record. Note 
that the exact value of expired carbon 
dioxide is less important than simple 
assessment of continuous respiratory 
gas exchange. In some situations 
in which there is excessive patient 
agitation or lack of cooperation or 
during certain procedures such as 
bronchoscopy, dentistry, or repair 
of facial lacerations capnography 
may not be feasible, and this 
situation should be documented. For 
uncooperative children, it is often 
helpful to defer the initiation of 
capnography until the child becomes 
sedated. Similarly, the stimulation 
of blood pressure cuff inflation may 
cause arousal or agitation; in such 
cases, blood pressure monitoring 
may be counterproductive and may 
be documented at less frequent 
intervals (eg, 10–15 minutes, 
assuming the patient remains stable, 
well oxygenated, and well perfused). 
Immobilization devices (protective 
stabilization) should be checked to 
prevent airway obstruction or chest 
restriction. If a restraint device is 
used, a hand or foot should be kept 
exposed. The child’s head position 
should be continuously assessed to 
ensure airway patency.
AFTER THE PROCEDURE. The child who has 
received moderate sedation must 
be observed in a suitably equipped 
recovery area, which must have 
a functioning suction apparatus 
as well as the capacity to deliver 
>90% oxygen and positive-pressure 
ventilation (bag-valve mask) with 
an adequate oxygen capacity as 
well as age- and size-appropriate 
rescue equipment and devices. 
The patient’s vital signs should be 
recorded at specific intervals (eg, 
every 10–15 minutes). If the patient 
is not fully alert, oxygen saturation 
and heart rate monitoring shall be 
used continuously until appropriate 
discharge criteria are met (see 
Appendix 1). Because sedation 
medications with a long half-life 
e10

, number

July 2016 
may delay the patient’s complete 
return to baseline or pose the 
risk of re-sedation, some patients 
might benefit from a longer period 
of less intense observation (eg, a 
step-down observation area where 
multiple patients can be observed 
simultaneously) before discharge 
from medical/dental supervision 
(see section entitled “Documentation 
Before Sedation” above).62, 
256, 
349, 
350 
A simple evaluation tool may be the 
ability of the infant or child to remain 
awake for at least 20 minutes when 
placed in a quiet environment.238 
Patients who have received reversal 
agents, such as flumazenil or 
naloxone, will require a longer period 
of observation, because the duration 
of the drugs administered may 
exceed the duration of the antagonist, 
resulting in re-sedation.
Deep Sedation/General Anesthesia
“Deep sedation” (“deep sedation/
analgesia”) is a drug-induced 
depression of consciousness during 
which patients cannot be easily 
aroused but respond purposefully 
after repeated verbal or painful 
stimulation (eg, purposefully pushing 
away the noxious stimuli). Reflex 
withdrawal from a painful stimulus 
is not considered a purposeful 
response and is more consistent with 
a state of general anesthesia. The 
ability to independently maintain 
ventilatory function may be impaired. 
Patients may require assistance in 
maintaining a patent airway, and 
spontaneous ventilation may be 
inadequate. Cardiovascular function 
is usually maintained. A state of deep 
sedation may be accompanied by 
partial or complete loss of protective 
airway reflexes. Patients may pass 
from a state of deep sedation to the 
state of general anesthesia. In some 
situations, such as during MRI, one is 
not usually able to assess responses 
to stimulation, because this would 
defeat the purpose of sedation, and 
one should assume that such patients 
are deeply sedated.
“General anesthesia” is a drug-
induced loss of consciousness during 
which patients are not arousable, 
even by painful stimulation. The 
ability to independently maintain 
ventilatory function is often 
impaired. Patients often require 
assistance in maintaining a patent 
airway, and positive-pressure 
ventilation may be required because 
of depressed spontaneous ventilation 
or drug-induced depression 
of neuromuscular function. 
Cardiovascular function may be 
impaired.
Personnel
During deep sedation, there 
must be 1 person whose only 
responsibility is to constantly 
observe the patient’s vital signs, 
airway patency, and adequacy of 
ventilation and to either administer 
drugs or direct their administration. 
This individual must, at a minimum, 
be trained in PALS and capable 
of assisting with any emergency 
event. At least 1 individual must 
be present who is trained in and 
capable of providing advanced 
pediatric life support and who is 
skilled to rescue a child with apnea, 
laryngospasm, and/or airway 
obstruction. Required skills include 
the ability to open the airway, 
suction secretions, provide CPAP, 
insert supraglottic devices (oral 
airway, nasal trumpet, LMA), and 
perform successful bag-valve-mask 
ventilation, tracheal intubation, and 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
Equipment
In addition to the equipment needed 
for moderate sedation, an ECG 
monitor and a defibrillator for use in 
pediatric patients should be readily 
available.
Vascular Access
Patients receiving deep sedation 
should have an intravenous line 
placed at the start of the procedure or 
have a person skilled in establishing 
vascular access in pediatric patients 
immediately available.
Monitoring
A competent individual shall 
observe the patient continuously. 
Monitoring shall include all 
parameters described for moderate 
sedation. Vital signs, including 
heart rate, respiratory rate, blood 
pressure, oxygen saturation, and 
expired carbon dioxide, must be 
documented at least every 5 minutes 
in a time-based record. Capnography 
should be used for almost all deeply 
sedated children because of the 
increased risk of airway/ventilation 
compromise. Capnography may 
not be feasible if the patient is 
agitated or uncooperative during 
the initial phases of sedation or 
during certain procedures, such as 
bronchoscopy or repair of facial 
lacerations, and this circumstance 
should be documented. For 
uncooperative children, the 
capnography monitor may be 
placed once the child becomes 
sedated. Note that if supplemental 
oxygen is administered, the 
capnograph may underestimate 
the true expired carbon dioxide 
value; of more importance than 
the numeric reading of exhaled 
carbon dioxide is the assurance 
of continuous respiratory gas 
exchange (ie, continuous waveform). 
Capnography is particularly useful 
for patients who are difficult to 
observe (eg, during MRI or in a 
darkened room).64,

The physician/dentist or his or her 
designee shall document the name, 
route, site, time of administration, 
and dosage of all drugs administered. 
If sedation is being directed by a 
physician who is not personally 
administering the medications, then 
recommended practice is for the 
nurse administering the medication 
to confirm the dose verbally before 
administration. The inspired

concentrations of inhalation sedation 
agents and oxygen and the duration of 
administration shall be documented.
Postsedation Care
The facility and procedures 
followed for postsedation care shall 
conform to those described under 
“moderate sedation.” The initial 
recording of vital signs should 
be documented at least every 5 
minutes. Once the child begins to 
awaken, the recording intervals may 
be increased to 10 to 15 minutes. 
Table 2 summarizes the equipment, 
personnel, and monitoring 
requirements for moderate and 
deep sedation.
Special Considerations
Neonates and Former Preterm Infants
Neonates and former preterm 
infants require specific management, 
because immaturity of hepatic and 
renal function may alter the ability 
to metabolize and excrete sedating 
medications, 
376 resulting in prolonged 
sedation and the need for extended 
postsedation monitoring. Former 
preterm infants have an increased 
risk of postanesthesia apnea, 
377 
but it is unclear whether a similar 
risk is associated with sedation, 
because this possibility has not been 
systematically investigated.378
Other concerns regarding the effects 
of anesthetic drugs and sedating 
medications on the developing 
brain are beyond the scope of this 
document. At this point, the research 
in this area is preliminary and 
inconclusive at best, but it would 
seem prudent to avoid unnecessary 
exposure to sedation if the procedure 
is unlikely to change medical/dental 
management (eg, a sedated MRI 
purely for screening purposes in 
preterm infants).379–382
Local Anesthetic Agents
All local anesthetic agents are cardiac 
depressants and may 
cause central nervous system 
excitation or depression. Particular 
weight-based attention should be 
paid to cumulative dosage in all 
children.118, 
120, 
125, 
383–386 To ensure 
that the patient will not receive an 
excessive dose, the maximum 
allowable safe dosage (eg, mg/kg) 
should be calculated before 
administration. There may be 
enhanced sedative effects when 
the highest recommended doses of 
local anesthetic drugs are used in 
combination with other sedatives or 
opioids (see Tables 3 and 4 for limits 
and conversion tables of commonly 
used local anesthetics).118, 
125, 
387–400

anesthetic drugs, the practitioner 
should aspirate frequently to 
minimize the likelihood that 
the needle is in a blood vessel; 
lower doses should be used when 
injecting into vascular tissues.401 
If high doses or injection of amide 
local anesthetics (bupivacaine and 
ropivacaine) into vascular tissues 
is anticipated, then the immediate 
availability of a 20% lipid emulsion 
for the treatment of local anesthetic 
toxicity is recommended (Tables 
3 and 5).402–409 Topical local 
anesthetics are commonly used and 
encouraged, but the practitioner 
should avoid applying excessive 
doses to mucosal surfaces where 
systemic uptake and possible toxicity 
(seizures, methemoglobinemia) 
could result and to remain within the 
manufacturer’s recommendations 
regarding allowable surface area 
application.410–415
Pulse Oximetry
Newer pulse oximeters are less 
susceptible to motion artifacts and 
may be more useful than older 
oximeters that do not contain 
updated software.416–420 Oximeters 
that change tone with changes in 
hemoglobin saturation provide 
immediate aural warning to everyone 
within hearing distance. The oximeter 
probe must be properly positioned; 
clip-on devices are easy to displace, 
which may produce artifactual data 
(under- or overestimation of oxygen 
saturation).361, 
362
Capnography
Expired carbon dioxide monitoring 
is valuable to diagnose the simple 
presence or absence of respirations, 
airway obstruction, or respiratory 
depression, particularly in patients 
sedated in less-accessible locations, 
such as in MRI machines or darkened 
rooms.64,

421–427 In patients receiving 
supplemental oxygen, capnography 
facilitates the recognition of apnea 
or airway obstruction several 
minutes before the situation would 
be detected just by pulse oximetry. 
In this situation, desaturation would 
be delayed due to increased oxygen 
reserves; capnography would enable 
earlier intervention.161 One study in 
children sedated in the emergency 
department found that the use of 
capnography reduced the incidence 
of hypoventilation and desaturation

Maximum recommended doses and durations of action are shown. Note that lower doses should be used in very vascular areas.
a These are maximum doses of local anesthetics combined with epinephrine; lower doses are recommended when used without epinephrine. Doses of amides should be decreased by 30% 
in infants younger than 6 mo. When lidocaine is being administered intravascularly (eg, during intravenous regional anesthesia), the dose should be decreased to 3 to 5 mg/kg; long-acting 
local anesthetic agents should not be used for intravenous regional anesthesia.
b Duration of action is dependent on concentration, total dose, and site of administration; use of epinephrine; and the patient’s age.
c Levobupivacaine is not available in the United States.

Treatment of Local Anesthetic Toxicity
1. Get help. Ventilate with 100% oxygen. Alert nearest facility with cardiopulmonary bypass capability.
2. Resuscitation: airway/ventilatory support, chest compressions, etc. Avoid vasopressin, calcium 
channel blockers, β-blockers, or additional local anesthetic. Reduce epinephrine dosages. Prolonged 
effort may be required.
3. Seizure management: benzodiazepines preferred (eg, intravenous midazolam 0.1–0.2 mg/kg); avoid 
propofol if cardiovascular instability.
4. Administer 1.5 mL/kg 20% lipid emulsion over ∼1 minute to trap unbound amide local anesthetics. 
Repeat bolus once or twice for persistent cardiovascular collapse.
5. Initiate 20% lipid infusion (0.25 mL/kg per minute) until circulation is restored; double the infusion 
rate if blood pressure remains low. Continue infusion for at least 10 minutes after attaining 
circulatory stability. Recommended upper limit of ∼10 mL/kg.
6. A fl
 uid bolus of 10–20 mL/kg balanced salt solution and an infusion of phenylephrine (0.1 μg/kg per 
minute to start) may be needed to correct peripheral vasodilation.

(7% to 1%).174 The use of expired 
carbon dioxide monitoring devices 
is now required for almost all 
deeply sedated children (with rare 
exceptions), particularly in situations 
in which other means of assessing 
the adequacy of ventilation are 
limited. Several manufacturers have 
produced nasal cannulae that allow 
simultaneous delivery of oxygen 
and measurement of expired carbon 
dioxide values.421, 
422, 
427 Although 
these devices can have a high degree 
of false-positive alarms, they are 
also very accurate for the detection 
of complete airway obstruction or 
apnea.164, 
168, 
169 Taping the sampling 
line under the nares under an oxygen 
face mask or nasal hood will provide 
similar information. The exact 
measured value is less important 
than the simple answer to the 
question: Is the child exchanging air 
with each breath?
Processed EEG (Bispectral Index)
Although not new to the anesthesia 
community, the processed EEG 
(bispectral index [BIS]) monitor 
is slowly finding its way into the 
sedation literature.428 Several studies 
have attempted to use BIS monitoring 
as a means of noninvasively 
assessing the depth of sedation. This 
technology was designed to examine 
EEG signals and, through a variety 
of algorithms, correlate a number 
with depth of unconsciousness: 
that is, the lower the number, the 
deeper the sedation. Unfortunately, 
these algorithms are based on adult 
patients and have not been validated 
in children of varying ages and 
varying brain development. Although 
the readings correspond quite well 
with the depth of propofol sedation, 
the numbers may paradoxically go up 
rather than down with sevoflurane 
and ketamine because of central 
excitation despite a state of general 
anesthesia or deep sedation.429, 
430 
Opioids and benzodiazepines have 
minimal and variable effects on the 
BIS. Dexmedetomidine has minimal 
effect with EEG patterns, consistent 
with stage 2 sleep.431 Several 
sedation studies have examined the 
utility of this device and degree of 
correlation with standard sedation 
scales.347, 
363, 
432–435 It appears that 
there is some correlation with BIS 
values in moderate sedation, but 
there is not a reliable ability to 
distinguish between deep sedation 
and moderate sedation or deep 
sedation from general anesthesia.432 
Presently, it would appear that BIS 
monitoring might provide useful 
information only when used for 
sedation with propofol363; in general, 
it is still considered a research tool 
and not recommended for routine 
use.
Adjuncts to Airway Management and 
Resuscitation
The vast majority of sedation 
complications can be managed 
with simple maneuvers, such as 
supplemental oxygen, opening the 
airway, suctioning, placement of an 
oral or nasopharyngeal airway, and 
bag-mask-valve ventilation. Rarely, 
tracheal intubation is required 
for more prolonged ventilatory 
support. In addition to standard 
tracheal intubation techniques, 
a number of supraglottic devices 
are available for the management 
of patients with abnormal airway 
anatomy or airway obstruction. 
Examples include the LMA, the cuffed 
oropharyngeal airway, and a variety 
of kits to perform an emergency 
cricothyrotomy.436, 
437
The largest clinical experience in 
pediatrics is with the LMA, which is 
available in multiple sizes, including 
those for late preterm and term 
neonates. The use of the LMA is now 
an essential addition to advanced 
airway training courses, and 
familiarity with insertion techniques 
can be life-saving.438–442 The LMA 
can also serve as a bridge to secure 
airway management in children with 
anatomic airway abnormalities.443, 
444 
Practitioners are encouraged to gain 
experience with these techniques as 
they become incorporated into PALS 
courses.
Another valuable emergency 
technique is intraosseous needle 
placement for vascular access. 
Intraosseous needles are available 
in several sizes; insertion can be 
life-saving when rapid intravenous 
access is difficult. A relatively new 
intraosseous device (EZ-IO Vidacare, 
now part of Teleflex, Research 
Triangle Park, NC) is similar to a 
hand-held battery-powered drill. 
It allows rapid placement with 
minimal chance of misplacement; it 
also has a low-profile intravenous 
adapter.445–450 Familiarity with the 
use of these emergency techniques 
can be gained by keeping current 
with resuscitation courses, such as 
PALS and advanced pediatric life 
support.
Patient Simulators
High-fidelity patient simulators are 
now available that allow physicians, 
dentists, and other health care 
providers to practice managing a 
variety of programmed adverse 
events, such as apnea, bronchospasm, 
and laryngospasm.133, 
220, 
450–452, 
 The 
use of such devices is encouraged to 
better train medical professionals and 
teams to respond more effectively 
to rare events.128, 
131, 
451, 
453–455 One 
study that simulated the quality 
of cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
compared standard management 
of ventricular fibrillation versus 
rescue with the EZ-IO for the rapid 
establishment of intravenous 
access and placement of an LMA 
for establishing a patent airway 
in adults; the use of these devices 
resulted in more rapid establishment 
of vascular access and securing of 
the airway.456
Monitoring During MRI
The powerful magnetic field and 
the generation of radiofrequency 
emissions necessitate the use 
of special equipment to provide

continuous patient monitoring 
throughout the MRI scanning 
procedure.457–459 MRI-compatible 
pulse oximeters and capnographs 
capable of continuous function 
during scanning should be used in 
any sedated or restrained pediatric 
patient. Thermal injuries can result 
if appropriate precautions are not 
taken; the practitioner is cautioned to 
avoid coiling of all wires (oximeter, 
ECG) and to place the oximeter 
probe as far from the magnetic 
coil as possible to diminish the 
possibility of injury. ECG monitoring 
during MRI has been associated 
with thermal injury; special MRI-
compatible ECG pads are essential 
to allow safe monitoring.460–463 If 
sedation is achieved by using an 
infusion pump, then either an MRI-
compatible pump is required or the 
pump must be situated outside of the 
room with long infusion tubing so 
as to maintain infusion accuracy. All 
equipment must be MRI compatible, 
including laryngoscope blades and 
handles, oxygen tanks, and any 
ancillary equipment. All individuals, 
including parents, must be screened 
for ferromagnetic materials, phones, 
pagers, pens, credit cards, watches, 
surgical implants, pacemakers, etc, 
before entry into the MRI suite.
Nitrous Oxide
Inhalation sedation/analgesia 
equipment that delivers nitrous 
oxide must have the capacity of 
delivering 100% and never less 
than 25% oxygen concentration 
at a flow rate appropriate to the 
size of the patient. Equipment 
that delivers variable ratios of 
nitrous oxide >50% to oxygen 
that covers the mouth and nose 
must be used in conjunction with 
a calibrated and functional oxygen 
analyzer. All nitrous oxide-to-
oxygen inhalation devices should 
be calibrated in accordance 
with appropriate state and local 
requirements. Consideration should 
be given to the National Institute 
of Occupational Safety and Health 
Standards for the scavenging of 
waste gases.464 Newly constructed 
or reconstructed treatment 
facilities, especially those with 
piped-in nitrous oxide and oxygen, 
must have appropriate state or 
local inspections to certify proper 
function of inhalation sedation/
analgesia systems before any 
delivery of patient care.
Nitrous oxide in oxygen, with 
varying concentrations, has been 
successfully used for many years 
to provide analgesia for a variety 
of painful procedures in 
children.14, 
36, 
49, 
98, 
465–493 The use of 
nitrous oxide for minimal sedation 
is defined as the administration 
of nitrous oxide of ≤50% with the 
balance as oxygen, without any other 
sedative, opioid, or other depressant 
drug before or concurrent with 
the nitrous oxide to an otherwise 
healthy patient in ASA class I or 
II. The patient is able to maintain 
verbal communication throughout 
the procedure. It should be noted 
that although local anesthetics have 
sedative properties, for purposes of 
this guideline they are not considered 
sedatives in this circumstance. If 
nitrous oxide in oxygen is combined 
with other sedating medications, 
such as chloral hydrate, midazolam, 
or an opioid, or if nitrous oxide is 
used in concentrations >50%, the 
likelihood for moderate or deep 
sedation increases.107, 
197, 
492, 
494, 
495 
In this situation, the practitioner is 
advised to institute the guidelines 
for moderate or deep sedation, 
as indicated by the patient’s 
response.496
