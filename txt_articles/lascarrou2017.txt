IMPORTANCE In the intensive care unit (ICU), orotracheal intubation can be associated with
increased risk of complications because the patient may be acutely unstable, requiring
prompt intervention, often by a practitioner with nonexpert skills. Video laryngoscopy may
decrease this risk by improving glottis visualization.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether video laryngoscopy increases the frequency of successful
first-pass orotracheal intubation compared with direct laryngoscopy in ICU patients.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized clinical trial of 371 adults requiring
intubation while being treated at 7 ICUs in France between May 2015 and January 2016; there
was 28 days of follow-up.
INTERVENTIONS Intubation using a video laryngoscope (n = 186) or direct laryngoscopy
(n = 185). All patients received general anesthesia.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with
successful first-pass intubation. The secondary outcomes included time to successful
intubation and mild to moderate and severe life-threatening complications.
RESULTS Among 371 randomized patients (mean [SD] age, 62.8 [15.8] years; 136 [36.7%]
women), 371 completed the trial. The proportion of patients with successful first-pass intubation
did not differ significantly between the video laryngoscopy and direct laryngoscopy groups
(67.7% vs 70.3%; absolute difference, −2.5% [95% CI, −11.9% to 6.9%]; P = .60). The proportion
of first-attempt intubations performed by nonexperts (primarily residents, n = 290) did not
differ between the groups (84.4% with video laryngoscopy vs 83.2% with direct laryngoscopy;
absolute difference 1.2% [95% CI, −6.3% to 8.6%]; P = .76). The median time to successful
intubation was 3 minutes (range, 2 to 4 minutes) for both video laryngoscopy and direct
laryngoscopy (absolute difference, 0 [95% CI, 0 to 0]; P = .95). Video laryngoscopy was not
associated with life-threatening complications (24/180 [13.3%] vs 17/179 [9.5%] for direct
laryngoscopy; absolute difference, 3.8% [95% CI, −2.7% to 10.4%]; P = .25). In post hoc analysis,
video laryngoscopy was associated with severe life-threatening complications (17/179 [9.5%] vs
5/179 [2.8%] for direct laryngoscopy; absolute difference, 6.7% [95% CI, 1.8% to 11.6%]; P = .01)
but not with mild to moderate life-threatening complications (10/181 [5.4%] vs 14/181 [7.7%];
absolute difference, −2.3% [95% CI, −7.4% to 2.8%]; P = .37).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients in the ICU requiring intubation, video
laryngoscopy compared with direct laryngoscopy did not improve first-pass orotracheal
intubation rates and was associated with higher rates of severe life-threatening
complications. Further studies are needed to assess the comparative effectiveness of these 2
strategies in different clinical settings and among operators with diverse skill levels.

I
ntubation of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) car-
ries a risk of potentially severe complications, including
cardiac arrest.1 Hypoxemia is common in patients in the
ICU requiring intubation, which must be performed rapidly
to avoid aspiration because the patient is usually not in
a fasted state.2 Studies have assessed interventions such
as routine neuromuscular blockade that are designed to
improve intubation success rates.3 Care bundles4 combined
with training on simulators have improved the safety of intu-
bation. Nevertheless, intubation in the ICU still carries higher
morbidity and mortality rates compared with intubation in
the operating room.5
For the past half century, orotracheal intubation has
been performed using the Macintosh laryngoscope for direct
laryngoscopy. The video laryngoscope is a recently devel-
oped device that provides indirect visualization of the glottis
via a camera. Video laryngoscopes have been extensively stud-
ied for intubation in the operating room and may facilitate oro-
trachealintubationcomparedwithdirectlaryngoscopy.6Video
laryngoscopes have either a curved blade similar to the
Macintosh laryngoscope or a tube channel.
In the ICU, observational studies and small randomized
studies support the use of video laryngoscopy for orotracheal
intubation,7 regardless of the predicted difficulty of intuba-
tion. Some of these studies also recorded adverse effects
such as longer duration of the orotracheal intubation pro-
cedure8andhighermortality.9Therefore,whetheruseofvideo
laryngoscopes in ICUs10 is of greater benefit to patients de-
serves investigation.
The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that
routine use of the video laryngoscope for orotracheal intuba-
tion of patients in the ICU increased the frequency of success-
ful first-pass intubation11 compared with use of the Macintosh
direct laryngoscope.
Methods
Study Design and Setting
The McGrath Mac Videolaryngoscope Versus Macintosh
Laryngoscope for Orotracheal Intubation in the Critical Care
Unit (MACMAN) trial was an institutionally sponsored, non-
blinded, multicenter, open-label, 2 parallel-group random-
ized clinical trial (RCT) conducted at 7 ICUs in France. The
protocol12 (appears in Supplement 1) was approved by the ap-
propriate ethics committee (Comité de Protection des
Personnes Ouest 2, #2014-A00674-43). According to French
law, because the strategies used in both groups were consid-
ered components of standard care, consent was not required;
however, it was mandatory that certain information be pro-
vided to the patient or next of kin.
If no next of kin was available, patients without decision-
making competence were included in compliance with
French law. Patients were informed as soon as they regained
competence and were asked whether they wanted to remain
in the trial. Data from patients who requested full withdrawal
were to be excluded from the analysis in accordance with
French law.
Inadditiontoelectronicdatabasemonitoring,onsitemoni-
toring was performed by a study nurse at each ICU to ensure
the good quality and completeness of the study data. All in-
vestigators attended a meeting about the trial before inclu-
sion of the first patient.
Patients were recruited between May and December 2015.
Patient follow-up was 28 days. The follow-up period ended in
January 2016.
Participants
Inclusion criteria were ICU admission and need for orotra-
cheal intubation to allow mechanical ventilation. Exclusion
criteria were (1) contraindications to orotracheal intubation
(eg, unstable spinal lesion), (2) insufficient time to include
and randomize the patient (eg, because of cardiac arrest),
(3) age younger than 18 years, (4) currently pregnant or
breastfeeding, (5) correctional facility inmate, (6) under
guardianship, (7) without health insurance, (8) refusal by
patient or next of kin, and (9) previous enrollment in an RCT
with intubation as the primary end point (including previous
inclusion in the present trial).
Randomization, Allocation Concealment, and Follow-up
The randomization sequence was generated by a statistician
at the clinical research unit (Centre Hospitalier Département
de la Vendée) who had no role in patient recruitment. Ran-
domization was performed in blocks of 4. The randomization
scheme was balanced and stratified by center and expert or
nonexpert status of the individual performing intubation.13
An expert was defined as a physician who had either worked
at ICUs for at least 5 years or worked at ICUs for at least 1 year
after receiving at least 2 years of anesthesiology training.
Physicians who did not meet these criteria were classified
as nonexperts.
The software used to collect the data from the electronic
report form automatically allocated the patients, thereby en-
suring concealment. Included patients were followed up un-
til day 28 after randomization.
Intervention and Control Intubation Methods
All physicians working at the participating ICUs received
hands-on training in the use of the video laryngoscope and
conventional (direct) laryngoscope. Specific equipment was
provided to each participating center for the training sessions
(eg, size 3 and 4 blades of each laryngoscope type and mani-
kins for intubation training). Orotracheal intubation per-
Key Points
Question Should video laryngoscopy be used for orotracheal
intubation in the intensive care unit (ICU) despite conflicting
evidence that it improves the first-pass success rate?
Findings Video laryngoscopy for orotracheal intubation in the ICU
did not improve the first-pass success rate compared with
conventional direct laryngoscopy (67.7% vs 70.3%, respectively).
Meaning Video laryngoscopy did not improve the frequency of
successful first-pass intubation in the ICU.

formed by a nonexpert was always supervised by an expert.
Orotracheal intubation was performed in both groups accord-
ing to the following protocol:
1. Preoxygenation was achieved using the device chosen by
the bedside physician according to the standard ICU pro-
tocol. Options included a bag valve mask delivering oxy-
gen at a flow of 15 L/min or greater for at least 3 minutes;
a nonrebreathing (high concentration) mask delivering oxy-
gen at a flow of 15 L/min or greater for at least 3 minutes;
a ventilator in noninvasive mode providing 100% fraction
of inspired oxygen (FIO2) for at least 3 minutes14; or a high-
flow nasal oxygen device (eg, Optiflow) delivering oxygen
at a flow of 60 L/min or greater with 100% FIO2 for at least
3 minutes.15
2. General anesthesia was then induced by injecting a hyp-
notic agent and a neuromuscular blocking agent. The choice
of agent and dosage were chosen by the individual perform-
ing the intubation. In agreement with the guidelines,16
2 principles were applied: (1) the preferred neuromuscular
blocking agent in the absence of contraindications (eg, hy-
perkalemia, burn injury >24 hours earlier, spinal lesion, or
allergy) was 1 mg/kg of succinylcholine and the alternative
was 1 mg/kg of rocuronium provided the antidote sugam-
madex (16 mg/kg) was available; and (2) the preferred hyp-
notic agent was either 0.2 to 0.3 mg/kg of etomidate or 1 to
2 mg/kg of ketamine.
3. Laryngoscopy was performed using the device allocated at
random (ie, either a video laryngoscope with a require-
ment to obtain indirect glottis visualization via the camera
for the first pass, or the Macintosh direct laryngoscope). The
McGrath MAC video laryngoscope (Medtronic) was chosen
for the intervention group because the intubation tech-
nique with this device is similar to that with the Macintosh
laryngoscope (in particular, the blade curve is not specifi-
callydesignedfordifficultintubation),apreviousstudysug-
gests benefits for ICU intubation,17 the small size of the de-
vice enabled bedside use, and the cost was low compared
withothervideolaryngoscopes.AsrecommendedbyFrench
guidelines,18 no stylet was used for the first-pass intuba-
tion attempt.
4. Intratracheal tube position was confirmed by analyzing the
capnography curve over 4 breaths or more. After tube in-
sertion, the cuff was inflated and the tube was connected
to the ventilator. Use of the Sellick maneuver was at the dis-
cretion of the individual performing intubation and was re-
corded on the electronic case report form.
5. Ifthefirst-passintubationattemptfailed,theindividualper-
forming intubation chose between repeat laryngoscopy and
an alternative intubation technique in accordance with
Frenchguidelines.18Duringrepeatlaryngoscopies,thevideo
laryngoscope could be used with either indirect or direct
glottis visualization. Each introduction of the laryngo-
scope into the oral cavity was considered a separate laryn-
goscopy attempt.
Study Outcomes
The primary outcome measure was the proportion of pa-
tients with successful first-pass orotracheal intubation, which
wasdefinedbasedonanormal-appearingwaveformofthepar-
tial pressure of end-tidal exhaled carbon dioxide curve over 4
or more breathing cycles.
The secondary outcomes included (1) the proportion of
patients with successful orotracheal intubation at any
attempt, (2) total time to successful orotracheal intubation
(time from anesthesia induction initiation to confirmation of
good tube position based on partial pressure of end-tidal
exhaled carbon dioxide), (3) Cormack-Lehane grade of glottis
visibility, (4) Percentage of Glottic Opening scale score,19
(5) proportion of patients with difficult intubation, (6) pro-
portion of patients intubated using alternative techniques
(gum elastic bougie, laryngeal mask airway [eg, Fastrach],
video laryngoscope proven helpful in difficult orotracheal
intubation [Airtraq or GlideScope], fiber optic endoscopy, or
rescue percutaneous or surgical transtracheal oxygenation),
(6) complications (death, cardiac arrest, severe cardiovascu-
lar collapse [systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg], hypoxemia
[oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter {SpO2} <90%] or severe
hypoxemia [SpO2 <80%], esophageal intubation, aspiration,
arrhythmia [ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation,
salve of ventricular premature beats], and dental injury),
(7) duration of mechanical ventilation, (8) ICU length of stay,
(9) hospital length of stay, (10) ICU mortality, and (11) 28-day
mortality. Previously described17 severe life-threatening com-
plications included death, cardiac arrest, severe cardiovascu-
lar collapse, and severe hypoxemia and mild to moderate life-
threatening complications included esophageal intubation,
aspiration, arrhythmia, and dental injury.
Sample Size
Based on previous data,17,20,21 the expected rate of successful
first-pass orotracheal intubation was 65% for patients in the
direct laryngoscopy group. Assuming that video laryngos-
copy would increase this proportion to 80%,17 with type I error
set at 5% and type II error set at 10%, 185 patients were needed
in each group (ie, 370 patients total).
Statistical Analysis
Baseline features were described as number (percentage) for
categorical variables and mean (standard deviation) and
quartiles for quantitative variables. Proportions of patients
with successful first-pass orotracheal intubation were com-
pared between groups using a mixed-effects logistic model to
account for stratification factors. The model included center
as a random effect and group and operator experience as
fixed effects. The intention-to-treat principle was followed.
A per-protocol analysis also was performed and excluded the
patients who (1) did not meet inclusion or exclusion criteria,
(2) did not receive invasive mechanical ventilation, or (3) had
medical reasons for study withdrawal.
Patients without data for the primary outcome were clas-
sified as experiencing intubation failure. A sensitivity analy-
sis based on the MACOCHA score (which is made up of a
Mallampati score of 3 or 4, apnea syndrome [obstructive],
cervical spine limitation, opening mouth <3 cm, coma,
hypoxemia, and operator not being an anesthesiologist) for
predicting difficult intubation was performed; when at least

1 component of the score was missing (161 patients), multiple
imputation (100 imputations) based on randomization
group, operator experience, and center was used.
Comparisons of the secondary outcomes were per-
formed using the χ2 or Fisher exact test for qualitative data and
the t test or the Wilcoxon rank sum test for quantitative data
as appropriate. Intubation procedure duration was assessed
using Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test. Post hoc sub-
group analyses were conducted using repeated-measures
mixed models in patients with (1) a ratio of PaO2 to FIO2 of less
than 200 mm Hg or (2) of less than 150 mm Hg at enrollment22
to assess whether the severity of hypoxemia was related to low
saturation during intubation.
All tests were 2-tailed. P values of less than .05 were con-
sidered significant. Multiple imputations were performed for
missing data. Stata statistical software version 13 (StataCorp)
was used. No adjustments were made for the multiple com-
parisons; therefore, the results for the secondary outcomes
should be interpreted as exploratory.
Results
Of489patientsassessedforeligibility,371wererandomizedand
includedintheintention-to-treatanalysis(mean[SD]age,62.8
[15.8] years; 136 [36.7%] women) and 365 were included in the
per-protocol analysis (Figure 1 and eTable 1 in Supplement 2).
Baseline features were evenly balanced between groups
(Table 1). The first orotracheal intubation attempt was per-
formed by nonexperts in 83.8% of patients and by experts in
16.2% of patients.
Primary Outcome: Successful First-Pass Intubation
Data on the primary outcome were unavailable for 5
patients, who were classified as experiencing first-pass oro-
tracheal intubation failure in the intention-to-treat analysis.
The 366 remaining patients were successfully intubated.
The proportion of patients experiencing successful first-
pass orotracheal intubation was not significantly different
between the video laryngoscopy group (126 of 186 patients
[67.7%]) and the direct laryngoscopy group (130 of 185
patients [70.3%]) (absolute difference, −2.5% [95% CI,
−11.9% to 6.9%]; P = .60).
The frequency of first-attempt orotracheal intubation fail-
ure was not significantly different with video laryngoscopy
(odds ratio [OR], 1.12 [95% CI, 0.71-1.78]; P = .63) both after ad-
justment for operator expertise (randomization stratification
factor) and after adjustment for the MACOCHA score (OR, 1.10
[95% CI, 0.69-1.75]; P = .69). The main reason for patients to
experience first-pass intubation failure was because the glot-
tis was not visualized during direct laryngoscopy. For pa-
tients in the video laryngoscopy group, first-pass intubation
failure was due to failure of tracheal catheterization (Table 2).

scores of less than 4 or scores of 4 or greater (eTable 4 and
eTable 5 in Supplement 2).
Secondary Outcomes
There were 368 patients successfully intubated; therefore,
no patients required alternative intubation or oxygenation
methods. In the video laryngoscopy group, Cormack-Lehane
grades of 1 or 2 (better glottis visualization) were more com-
mon, the percentage of glottic opening score was higher, and
a gum elastic bougie was used more often during first-pass

orotracheal intubation. Most first intubation attempts were
made by nonexperts (primarily residents, n = 290) and most
subsequent attempts were made by experts, yielding no sig-
nificant between-group differences (Table 3). First intuba-
tion attempts were successful more often when performed by
experts (55 of 60 patients [91.7%]) compared with when per-
formed by nonexperts (201 of 311 patients [64.6%]) (absolute
difference, 27.1% [95% CI, 18.2%-35.8%]; P = .001).
Bag valve ventilation was the most common preoxygen-
ation method used in both groups. The median duration of the
intubation procedure of 3 minutes (range, 2-4 minutes) did not
differ between the 2 groups (absolute difference, 0 [95% CI,
0-0]; P = .95). In patients with successful first-pass orotra-
cheal intubation, the median duration of the intubation pro-
cedure did not significantly differ between the video laryn-
goscopy group (2 minutes) and the direct laryngoscopy group
(2.5 minutes) (absolute difference, 0 [95% CI, 0-0]; P = .61).
The proportion of patients with severe life-threatening
complications was higher in the video laryngoscopy group
(9.5% vs 2.8% in the direct laryngoscopy group; absolute
difference, 6.7% [95% CI, 1.8% to 11.6%]; P = .01), whereas no

Discussion
In the MACMAN trial, video laryngoscopy did not improve
the frequency of successful first-pass orotracheal intu-
bation compared with direct laryngoscopy. Furthermore, the
video laryngoscopy group had a higher frequency of severe
life-threatening complications (but not mild to moderate life-
threatening complications) and need for use of a gum elastic
bougie during the first intubation attempt.
Inobservationalstudies,23-25apropensity-adjustedstudy,26
a single-center RCT,7 and in 2 meta-analyses of the data,27,28
video laryngoscopy improved the first-pass orotracheal intu-
bation success rate compared with direct laryngoscopy. How-
ever,thesestudieshadmajormethodologicalweaknessessuch
as (1) a retrospective design, before and after design, or single-
center recruitment, (2) absence of routine neuromuscular
blockade, and (3) exclusion of the patients with the most se-
vere cases of hypoxemia (SpO2 <92% after bag valve mask ven-
tilation) from the RCT.7 Other studies8,9,17,29-31 failed to show
improvements with use of video laryngoscopy compared with
use of direct laryngoscopy. Similarly, in 2 recent single-center
RCTs,32,33thefirst-passorotrachealintubationsuccessratewas
not higher with use of video laryngoscopy compared with use
of direct laryngoscopy.
The present report adds to these results by providing data
from a multicenter RCT with an objective primary outcome
measure (ie, capnography), ensuring a low risk of bias and high
external validity. Several factors may explain the discrep-
ancy in results of early studies vs recent RCTs. One is a high
success rate in the direct laryngoscopy group, related in par-
ticulartoadherencetoastandardizedprotocol,2includingrou-
tine neuromuscular blockade.3 Thus, in the MACMAN trial,
even the nonexperts had a first-pass intubation success rate
of 70% with direct laryngoscopy, and the experts had a suc-
cess rate of 93.2%. The direct laryngoscopy success rate con-
firms that the sample size was correctly estimated.
Improvedglottisvisualizationwithvideolaryngoscopydid
not translate into a higher success rate for first-pass intuba-
tionbecausetrachealcatheterizationunderindirectvisionwas
more difficult, in keeping with earlier data.32,33 Conceivably,
a video laryngoscope with an intubation channel might im-
prove the success rate, although preliminary data obtained in
the operating room are inconclusive.34
The frequency of severe life-threatening complications
was higher with video laryngoscopy than with Macintosh
laryngoscopy. Previous RCTs in trauma patients found
higher mortality rates in the subgroups with traumatic brain
injury9 or longer duration of the orotracheal intubation
procedure.8,9,35 Consistent with the results reported herein,
an RCT in ICU patients showed a lower median arterial oxy-
gen saturation with video laryngoscopy (86% [interquartile
range, 75%-93%]) than with direct laryngoscopy (95%
[interquartile range, 85%-99%]; P = .04), possibly due to the
longer median orotracheal intubation procedure duration
with video laryngoscopy (221 seconds [interquartile range,
103-291 seconds] vs 156 seconds [interquartile range, 67-220
seconds] with direct laryngoscopy; P = .15).32
The better visualization of the glottis with video laryn-
goscopy might lead to a false impression of safety when
orotracheal intubation is performed by nonexperts. The sub-
group analyses did not identify factors associated with
life-threatening complications with video laryngoscopy. In
addition, poorer alignment of the pharyngeal axis, laryngeal
axis, and mouth opening despite good glottis visualization by
video laryngoscopy can lead to mechanical upper airway ob-
struction and faster progression to hypoxemia.36
Use of a gum elastic bougie during the first intubation at-
tempt was more common with video laryngoscopy. Due to the
indirect visualization of the glottis with video laryngoscopy,
some manufacturers recommend using an intubation stylet.
The manufacturer of the video laryngoscope used in this study
does not recommend using a stylet because the blade curva-
ture is similar to that of the Macintosh laryngoscope and di-
rect glottis visualization is possible.37 The 2 devices are also
similar in regard to the grip handle and passage into the mouth
and larynx. With the Macintosh laryngoscope, use of a gum
elastic bougie (compared with a stylet38) was associated with
a higher success rate for orotracheal intubation in the event
of poor glottis visibility; therefore, stylet use is considered in-
advisable for difficult orotracheal intubation according to
French guidelines.18
With video laryngoscopy, use of a gum elastic bougie has
been reported to be as efficient as a stylet for improving suc-
cess rates of first-pass orotracheal intubation.39 A stylet was
notusedroutinelyforpatientsinthevideolaryngoscopygroup.
TheuseofagumelasticbougieismorecommoninEuropethan
in the United States.6 Furthermore, in a trial involving rou-
tine use of a stylet,33 success rates for first-pass orotracheal in-
tubation were not significantly different between the video la-
ryngoscopy and direct laryngoscopy groups.
This study has several limitations. It assessed a single
type of video laryngoscope, which has a curved blade similar
to the direct laryngoscope. Other video laryngoscopes with a
hyperangulated blade or specific intubation channel might
have produced different results. Most of the first attempts of
intubation were made by nonexpert physicians for both the
video laryngoscopy and direct laryngoscopy groups; how-
ever, the trial was intended to reflect actual clinical condi-
tions in which orotracheal intubation is often performed by
nonexperts.13 Physician intubation expertise requires theo-
retical skills, manikin practice, and supervised hands-on
training. Adequate intubation training is defined as having
performed at least 50 orotracheal intubation procedures
under supervision.40

Successful first-pass intubation was chosen as the primary
outcome because several studies showed a strong correlation
between the frequency of complications such as hypoxemia,
cardiac arrest, and death and the number of laryngoscopy
attempts.13 Blindingwasnotfeasiblesosuccessfulfirst-passin-
tubation defined by capnography was chosen because it is an
objective outcome measure. The success rate of first-pass
orotracheal intubation was consistent with previously pub-
lished data.17,25 The duration of the orotracheal intubation pro-
cedure was not significantly different between the 2 groups.
Conclusions
Among patients in the ICU requiring intubation, video laryn-
goscopy compared with direct laryngoscopy did not improve
first-pass orotracheal intubation rates and was associated with
higher rates of severe life-threatening complications. Fur-
ther studies are needed to assess the comparative effective-
nessofthese2strategiesindifferentclinicalsettingsandamong
