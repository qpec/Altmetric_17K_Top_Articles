The  objective
 of  this  study  was  to  investigate
 seasonal
 and
 all  time  doping
 among
 Danish
 elite  athletes
(N
 =  771,  male  =  56.5%)  and  to investigate
 gender  differences.
 An  online
 survey
 was
 conducted
 (response
rate
 =  57%)
 which
 included
 biographical
 information
 as well  as  randomized
 response
 technique
 questions
about
 seasonal
 and
 all-time
 doping.  Concerning
 last  season  prevalence,
 the
 maximum
 doping
 rate was
estimated
 at  30.6%
 (95%  confidence
 interval
 22.6–35.7)
 and
 the  rate  of  honest
 non-dopers
 was
 estimated
at
 69.4%.
 For  the  lifetime  prevalence
 of  doping,  a rate  of at  least  3.1%  dopers
 (95%  confidence
 interval
 0–8.9)
and
 a
 maximum
 of
 26%  (95%  confidence
 interval
 13.4–40.8),
 with  a rate  of  approximately
 74%  who  can
reliably
 be estimated
 to  have  never  doped
 throughout
 their  career  was  identified.
 No
 significant
 gender
differences
 were  found.  In  conclusion,
 the  doping
 prevalence
 among
 Danish
 elite  athletes
 is
 similar to
that
 of Dutch
 and  German
 elite  athletes.

 Introduction
The
 use
 of
 banned
 substances
 to
 enhance
 performance,
 also
known
 as
 doping,
 occurs
 in
 sport.
 Alaranta,
 Holmila,
 Palmu,
 Pietilä
and
 Helenius
 (2006)
 reported
 that
 22%
 of
 team
 sport
 athletes,
 37%
of
 endurance
 sport
 athletes,
 and
 43%
 of
 speed
 and
 power
 sport
 ath-
letes
 personally
 knew
 an
 athlete,
 who
 used
 banned
 substances.
However,
 it
 is
 difficult
 to
 obtain
 honest
 replies
 when
 asking
 ath-
letes
 directly
 about
 their
 own
 doping
 behavior.
 The
 estimation
 of
reliable
 rates
 of
 doping
 prevalence
 is
 of
 great
 importance
 in
 order
to
 properly
 plan
 and
 evaluate
 anti-doping
 policies.
The
 prevalence
 of
 doping
 has
 mostly
 been
 estimated
 based
 on
the
 number
 of
 positive
 doping
 test
 results,
 on
 questionnaires,
 con-
taining
 direct
 questions
 about
 drug
 use
 or
 with
 questionnaires
about
 drug
 use
 by
 other
 athletes.
 All
 three
 of
 these
 methods,
 how-
ever,
 have
 shown
 to
 be
 inaccurate
 (for
 an
 overview
 of
 results
 as
 well
as
 a
 discussion
 of
 the
 weaknesses
 see
 Pitsch
 &
 Emrich
 (2012)).
 Typ-
ical
 figures,
 based
 on
 positive
 doping
 tests
 results
 range
 from
 0.96%
to
 2.45%
 for
 Olympic-level
 athletes
 tested
 between
 1987
 and
 2013
(de
 Hon,
 Kuipers
 &
 Van
 Bottenburg,
 2014).
 This
 estimation
 is
 widely
confirmed
 by
 the
 number
 of
 adverse
 analytical
 findings
 from
 the
annually
 published
 doping
 test
 statistics
 by
 the
 World
 Anti-Doping
Agency
 (WADA)
 which
 typically
 reveal
 a
 rate
 of
 approximately
 2%.
Nevertheless,
 these
 studies
 do
 not
 provide
 an
 estimation
 of
 the
 dop-
ing
 prevalence
 in
 elite
 sport
 due
 to
 different
 disciplines,

and
 levels
 of
 athletic
 performance
 which
 were
 studied.
 Therefore,
results
 even
 for
 the
 same
 discipline
 often
 vary
 widely;
 for
 exam-
ple,
 estimation
 of
 doping
 prevalence
 in
 body
 building
 ranges
 from
20%
 (Houlihan,
 2002)
 to
 77.8%
 (Blouin
 &
 Goldfield,
 1995; Pedersen,
2005).
 A
 broad
 overview
 of
 results
 from
 such
 studies
 was
 pro-
vided
 by
 Backhouse,
 McKenna,
 Robinson,
 and
 Atkin
 (2007).
 When
elite
 athletes
 were
 asked
 for
 the
 doping
 prevalence
 among
 their
competitors,
 studies
 mostly
 revealed
 prevalence
 estimations
 of
approximately
 30%,
 but,
 as
 for
 the
 aforementioned
 studies,
 due
to
 differences
 in
 scope
 and
 discipline,
 these
 results
 also
 cannot
 be
combined
 to
 estimations
 of
 the
 doping
 prevalence
 in
 elite
 sport.
Such
 problems
 estimating
 the
 prevalence
 of
 doping
 strongly
suggest
 the
 use
 of
 indirect
 questioning
 techniques
 for
 measuring
doping
 behaviour
 (Pielke,
 2018).
 Among
 the
 indirect
 questioning
techniques,
 the
 randomized
 response
 technique
 (RRT)
 has
 been
used
 mostly
 in
 studies
 on
 the
 prevalence
 of
 doping
 in
 elite
 sport
(for
 an
 overview,
 see
 Pitsch
 (2016)).
 This
 technique
 allows
 investi-
gators
 to
 pose
 sensitive
 questions
 to
 respondents
 in
 a
 manner
 that
visibly
 guarantees
 the
 respondents’
 anonymity—thus
 encouraging
truthful
 responses
 (for
 the
 reliability
 of

 that
 the

techniques

between
 20.4%
 and
 38.7%.
 Correspondingly,
 at
 least
 51.9%
 of
 ath-
letes
 were
 assumed
 to
 have
 never
 used
 doping
 techniques.
 In
 the
2005
 season,
 61.3%
 of
 athletes
 competed
 without
 using
 illicit
 drugs
or
 methods
 to
 enhance
 their
 sport
 performance.
 In
 2008
 there
was
 an
 attempt
 to
 replicate
 the
 findings
 of
 Pitsch
 et
 al.’s
 studies.
The
 survey
 resulted
 in
 a
 rate
 of
 10.2%
 “honest
 dopers”,
 irrespec-
tive
 of
 the
 disciplines,
 obtained
 with
 the
 question:
 ‘Have
 you
 ever
knowingly
 used
 illicit
 drugs
 or
 methods
 in
 order
 to
 enhance
 your
performance?’
 (Pitsch
 &
 Emrich,
 2012).
 This
 study
 also
 revealed
a
 remarkably
 large
 difference
 in
 the
 doping
 prevalence
 between
male
 and
 female
 athletes.
 While
 the
 lifetime
 prevalence
 for
 male
athletes
 ranged
 between
 17.1%
 and
 47.4%,
 these
 figures
 for
 female
athletes
 were
 from
 2.9%
 up
 to
 21.3%.
 The
 same
 difference
 was
reported
 for
 the
 past
 year
 doping
 prevalence
 (female:
 1.4–19.8%,
male:
 16.5–48.0%).
A
 study
 conducted
 in
 the
 Netherlands
 by
 Duiven
 and
 de
 Hon
(2015)
 on
 the
 prevalence
 of
 doping
 among
 Dutch
 elite
 athletes
revealed
 an
 overall
 prevalence
 of
 4.2%
 for
 the
 lifetime
 doping
 usage.
In
 a
 study
 among
 elite
 athletes,
 the
 estimated
 prevalence
 of
 past-
year
 doping
 was
 43.6%
 at
 a
 track
 and
 field
 World
 Championship
 and
57.1%
 at
 the
 Pan-Arab
 Games
 (Ulrich
 et
 al.,
 2018).
In
 conclusion
 one
 can
 state
 that
 studies
 utilizing
 the
 RRT
 deliver
higher
 prevalence
 rates
 of
 doping
 than
 doping
 testing.
 It
 can
 be
assumed
 that
 this
 method
 comes
 closer
 to
 revealing
 the
 actual
 dop-
ing
 prevalence
 than
 other
 types
 of
 studies
 do.
 The
 aim
 of
 this
 study
was
 to
 apply
 the
 RRT
 in
 Denmark
 to
 Danish
 elite
 athletes.
 The
 goal
was
 to
 estimate
 the
 doping
 prevalence
 among
 Danish
 elite
 athletes
and
 to
 investigate
 whether
 gender
 differences
 between
 male
 and
female
 elite
 athletes
 exist.
2.
 Method
2.1.
 Participants
The
 study
 included
 a
 total
 of
 771
 (56.5%
 male)
 elite
 athletes
recruited
 in
 Denmark.
 Two
 athletes
 did
 not
 provide
 information
about
 their
 gender.
 With
 regard
 to
 age,
 35.7%
 were
 13–18
 years
old,
 35.3%
 were
 19–24
 years
 old,
 25.7%
 were
 25–29
 years
 old
 and
13.3%
 older
 than
 30.
 The
 majority
 of
 athletes
 anticipated
 that
 their
career
 would
 last
 five
 or
 more
 seasons
 (65.5%)
 or
 for
 2–5
 years
(20.9%).
 A
 bit
 more
 than
 a
 tenth
 of
 the
 athletes
 (13.6%)
 expected
their
 career
 to
 last
 two
 more
 years
 or
 less
 than
 that.
 The
 majority
 of
athletes
 received
 no
 income
 at
 all
 from
 sport
 (52.9%)
 or
 occasional
income
 (20.3%).
 Only
 26.8%
 of
 the
 athletes
 received
 regular
 income
from
 sport.
 Around
 forty
 percent
 (39.2%)
 of
 athletes
 were
 from
team
 sports,
 27.7%
 from
 endurance
 sports,
 16.6%
 from
 motor
 skills
sports
 and
 16.4%
 were
 from
 speed
 and
 power
 sports
 (following
 the
categorization
 of
 Alaranta
 et
 al.
 (2006)).
2.2.
 Measures
2.2.1.
 Biographical
 information
Athletes
 were
 asked
 to
 indicate
 age
 (in
 categories
 of
 5
 years),
gender,
 years
 of
 school
 they
 had
 completed,
 which
 sport
 they
 were
involved
 in,
 how
 long
 they
 still
 anticipated
 competing
 in
 elite
sports,
 and
 to
 which
 extent
 they
 derived
 income
 from
 their
 sport.
2.2.2.
 Doping
 prevalence
In
 this
 study,
 two
 sensitive
 questions
 were
 asked
 using
 the
 RRT:
‘Have
 you
 ever
 intentionally
 used
 forbidden
 substances
 and/or
 for-
bidden
 methods
 in
 order
 to
 enhance
 your
 sporting
 performance
 in
competitions?’
 was
 used
 to
 assess
 whether
 participants
 had
 ever
doped.
 “Have
 you
 intentionally
 used
 forbidden
 substances
 and/or
forbidden
 methods
 in
 order
 to
 enhance
 your
 sporting
 performance
in
 competitions
 during
 the
 last
 season?”
 was
 used
 to
 assess
 last
season
 doping.
 Before
 the
 interviewee
 answered
 this
 question,
 he
or
 she
 received
 an
 additional
 instruction
 which
 referred
 to
 the
 ran-
domization
 device,
 used
 for
 the
 RRT
 (see
 Fig.
 1).
2.3.
 Procedure
A
 total
 of
 67
 Danish
 sport
 federations
 were
 contacted
 and
 asked
to
 provide
 email
 addresses
 and
 names
 of
 their
 elite
 status
 ath-
letes.
 Resulting
 from
 the
 replies
 received
 from
 all
 of
 the
 contacted
sport
 federations,
 a
 total
 of
 1,359
 personalized
 emails
 were
 sent
 out
on
 16
 December
 2016.
 Reminders
 were
 sent
 out
 on
 27
 December
2016
 as
 well
 as
 on
 6
 and
 20
 January
 2017.
 In
 total,
 776
 athletes
replied
 (response
 rate
 of
 57%).
 Thirteen
 cases
 were
 excluded
 due
 to
(almost)
 no
 data.
 The
 remaining
 763
 data
 sets
 included
 large
 clus-
ters
 of
 nonresponse
 due
 to
 prematurely
 aborting
 the
 questionnaire.
Item
 non-response
 in
 terms
 of
 not
 answering
 the
 RRT
 questions
 on
last
 year
 doping
 was
 seen
 in
 145
 cases
 (page
 6
 of
 the
 web
 form)
 and
in
 41
 more
 cases
 for
 the
 question
 on
 lifetime
 doping
 (page
 8).
 In
 all
of
 these
 cases,
 the
 questionnaire
 was
 aborted
 at
 that
 point.
 Among
the
 other
 respondents
 who
 had
 answered
 the
 RRT-questions,
 only
nine
 more
 prematurely
 aborted
 the
 questionnaire.
Unfortunately,
 there
 is
 no
 way
 to
 test
 if
 the
 sample
 is
 repre-
sentative
 of
 the
 population
 in
 terms
 of
 distribution
 by
 sex,
 age
 or
discipline
 as
 these
 data
 are
 unknown
 for
 the
 population
 of
 elite
 ath-
letes
 in
 Denmark.
 Nevertheless,
 both
 the
 distribution
 of
 the
 sample
by
 age
 and
 by
 sex
 do
 not
 raise
 concerns
 that
 the
 sample
 might
 be
heavily
 distorted.
 Additionally,
 if
 one
 takes
 into
 account
 that
 even
the
 reduced
 subsample
 of
 577
 athletes
 who
 had
 answered
 the
 RRT
questions
 represent
 42.4%
 of
 the
 population,
 the
 sampling
 error
and
 thus,
 the
 probability
 to
 have
 ended
 up
 with
 a
 heavily
 distorted
sample
 is
 far
 lower
 than
 normal
 in
 empirical
 social
 research.
Some
 98%
 of
 participants
 completed
 the
 Danish
 version
 of
 the
survey
 and
 2%
 the
 English
 version.
 The
 study,
 which
 followed
 the
ethical
 guidelines
 of
 the
 American
 Psychological
 Association,
 was
performed
 in
 accordance
 with
 the
 guidelines
 set
 by
 the
 Danish
 Data
Authorities.
 In
 accordance
 with
 Danish
 law,
 no
 ethical
 approval
 was
required
 for
 the
 project
 as
 it
 was
 non-biomedical
 research.
The
 RRT
 was
 used
 to
 assess
 the
 prevalence
 of
 doping.
 Prior
 to
presenting
 the
 RRT-questions,
 each
 athlete
 was
 asked
 to
 deliber-
ately
 select
 one
 number
 from
 a
 list
 of
 five
 randomly
 generated
three-digit
 figures.
 This
 list
 was
 randomly
 generated
 each
 time
 this
page
 of
 the
 web
 survey
 was
 opened.
 Additionally,
 the
 athletes
 were
offered
 the
 opportunity
 to
 select
 the
 figures
 from
 a
 Danish
 license
plate.
 As
 the
 selected
 figure
 is
 crucial
 to
 the
 randomization
 pro-
cess,
 this
 procedure
 was
 chosen
 in
 order
 to
 ensure
 the
 athletes
 that
the
 researchers
 in
 no
 way
 could
 know,
 which
 figure
 they
 used
 to
answer
 the
 subsequent
 RRT
 questions.
Depending
 on
 the
 digit
 in
 the
 last
 position
 (for
 the
 last
 season
doping
 question)
 or
 on
 the
 second
 to
 last
 position
 (for
 lifetime
 dop-
ing),
 the
 athletes
 were
 instructed
 to
 answer
 one
 of
 three
 questions.
Two
 of
 these
 questions
 always
 resulted
 in
 a
 “yes”
 (“Does
 every
week
 have
 seven
 days?”)
 or
 a
 “no”
 answer
 (“Does
 every
 week
 have
nine
 days?”)
 if
 respondents
 answered
 honestly.
 The
 third
 question
was
 a
 sensitive
 question
 related
 to
 doping.
 This
 special
 technique
combines
 the
 advantages
 of
 the
 “forced
 answer”
 RRT,
 namely
 the
definitely
 known
 “yes”
 and
 “no”
 probabilities
 and
 the
 advantage
 of
the
 “unrelated
 question”
 RRT
 which
 does
 not
 force
 respondents
 to
provide
 sensitive
 answers
 (briefly
 described
 in
 Horvitz,
 Greenberg
and
 Abernathy
 (1975),
 cf.
 also
 Lanke
 (1975)).
 An
 overview
 of
 the
whole
 procedure
 can
 be
 found
 at:
 http://demo.socioeconomy.eu/
DopingDenmark/.
For
 the
 RRT
 used
 in
 this
 survey,
 a
 total
 cheater
 detection
 model
was
 implemented
 (Feth
 Frenger,
 Pitsch,
 &
 Schmelzeisen,
 2017).
Therefore,
 respondents
 were
 randomly
 assigned
 to
 one
 of
 three
RRT
 subgroups,
 using
 the
 following
 probabilities
 for
 the
 sensitive
and
 the
 yes-
 and
 no-questions
 (see
 Fig.

Before we ask the qu
 estion, you have to choose a random number .
A sample qu
 estion
 
 is:
Does a week 
have 9 days?
Have you intentionally used forbidd
 en substance
 s and/or 
forbidden methods in order to enhance your sporting 
performance in competitions
 
during 
 the last season?
Does a week 
have 7 days?
You
  will rece
 
ive
  the following
  instructi
 ons rega
 rding
  how to an
 swer the qu
 estion:
If the last digit of your
 
random number is
* a 1 or 2, please answer to the qu
 estion on the right-hand side
* if it is a 3, 
 4 or 5, please answer to the qu
 estion on the left hand side
* if it is a another digit, 
 please answer the qu
 estion in the middle.
Let's assume that the sixth digit of the serial number is a "1" and therefore you answer to the 
question on the right hand side with "yes". We, the compilers of the data, will not know 
whether you in fac
 t have used performance-enhancing
  illegal substances or prescription 
drug
 s, or whether the digit was a 1 or a 2. We will however, 
 with the help of mathematical 
process
 
es, be able to calculate with a degree
  of ce
 rtainty app
 roximately how many people 
have or have not used substance
 s to enhance
  their performance (over all the "yes"-answers, 
which are given).
Let us now ass
 ume that the digit of the serial number is a "6". In this ca
 se you have to answer 
to the qu
 estion in the middle (the sensitive qu
 estion). If your answer is "yes", because of the 
fac
 t that you have used illegal substances, 
 it is im
 possible for us to know, if your answer 
comes from this fact or beca
 
use your digit is a "1" or a "2". (we don't know your chosen 
random number)
By using
  this process, 
 
you may honestly answer without conce
 rn, since
  we cannot conclude 
that you personally have in fac
 t used performance-enhancing il

 Probabilities
 for
 the
 sensitive
 and
 the
 yes-
 and
 no-questions.
With
 these
 probabilities,
 the
 estimation
 of
 the
 parameters
 with
 a
reasonably
 low
 error
 rate
 is
 possible
 (Feth
 et
 al.,
 2017).
 Additionally,
the
 different
 probability
 sets
 for
 the
 two
 questions
 were
 chosen
 in
order
 to
 decrease
 the
 probability
 that
 respondents
 received
 instruc-
tions
 with
 a
 low
 probability
 to
 answer
 the
 sensitive
 questions
 twice.
This
 was
 done
 in
 order
 to
 maximize
 the
 number
 of
 respondents
 who
were
 at
 least
 once
 asked
 to
 answer
 a
 sensitive
 question
 honestly.
This
 reduces
 the
 number
 of
 participants
 who
 are
 forced
 to
 answer
yes
 or
 no
 in
 both
 questions
 thus
 getting
 the
 (assumed)
 frustrating
impression
 of
 not
 being
 taken
 seriously
 as
 a
 valuable
 informant.
The
 total
 cheater
 detection
 model
 allows
 to
 estimate
• The
 rate
 of
 honest
 yes-responders
 to
 the
 embarrassing
 question,
• The
 rate
 of
 honest
 no-responders
 to
 the
 question,
• The
 rate
 of
 no-cheaters,
 who
 always
 answer
 no,
 even
 if
 instructed
to
 answer
 (either
 honestly
 or
 due
 to
 the
 forced
 instruction)
 yes,
• The
 rate
 of
 yes-cheaters,
 who
 always
 answer
 yes,
 even
 if
instructed
 to
 answer
 (either
 honestly
 or
 due
 to
 the
 forced
 instruc-
tion)
 no.
Both
 forms
 of
 cheating
 may
 occur
 in
 cases
 of
 misunderstand-
ing
 the
 instruction,
 mistrusting
 the
 technique
 or
 erroneously
 using
the
 randomization
 device
 (here:
 the
 random
 number).

no-cheating
 may
 occur
 as
 an
 effect
 of
 perceived
 social
 desirability
when
 respondents
 deliberately
 cheat
 when
 instructed
 to
 honestly
answer
 yes.
 Yes-cheating
 may
 be
 a
 result
 of
 strategically
 tampering
with
 the
 survey
 (e.g.
 to
 blow
 the
 prevalence
 estimation
 of
 doping
out
 of
 proportion
 in
 order
 to
 support
 more
 restrictive
 anti-doping
policies).
 No
 matter
 what
 the
 reasons
 for
 yes-
 or
 no-cheating
 are,
there
 is
 no
 information
 about
 the
 true
 property
 (user
 or
 non-user
 of
forbidden
 substances
 or
 methods)
 of
 these
 shares
 of
 respondents.
Especially
 the
 commonplace
 interpretation
 that
 no-cheaters
 avoid
an
 honest
 yes-answer
 and
 that
 yes-cheaters
 avoid
 an
 honest
 no-
answer
 is
 incorrect.
 There
 is
 no
 way
 to
 derive
 this
 information
 from
the
 data.
2.4.
 Statistical
 analysis
For
 RRT
 with
 cheater
 detection,
 error
 components
 are
 typically
not
 distributed
 normally,
 but
 are
 heavily
 skewed
 (Feth
 et
 al.,
 2017;
Pitsch,
 Frenger
 &
 Emrich,
 2013).
 Therefore,
 significance
 tests
 should
be
 performed
 using
 bootstrap
 statistics
 (Davison
 &
 Hinkley,
 1997;
Efron
 &
 Tibshirani,
 1993).
 This
 class
 of
 resampling
 methods
 allows
for
 non-parametric
 calculations
 of
 confidence
 intervals,
 indepen-
dently
 from
 any
 distribution
 assumption.
 To
 test
 for
 differences
between
 groups,
 we
 calculated
 the
 bootstrapped
 confidence
 inter-
vals
 of
 these
 differences,
 using
 the
 bias
 correction
 and
 acceleration
(BC�)
 algorithm
 (Efron
 &
 Tibshirani,
 1993).
 For
 two
 groups
 to
 differ
significantly,
 the
 confidence
 interval
 must
 not
 include
 the
 value
 0,
otherwise,
 the
 test
 fails
 and
 the
 hypothesis
 is
 rejected.
Due
 to
 this
 method,
 the
 results
 of
 the
 statistical
 tests
 cannot
be
 reported
 in
 a
 similar
 way
 as
 when
 using
 classical
 tests
 (e.g.
with
 t-
 or
 F-values,
 degrees
 of
 freedom).
 Additionally,
 the
 often-
reported
 p-values,
 indicating
 the
 estimated
 achieved
 significance
level
 become
 meaningless.
 They
 could
 be
 reported
 by
 principle
(Efron
 &
 Tibshirani,
 1993),
 but
 would
 very
 likely
 vary
 between
different
 bootstrap-simulations
 even
 if
 the
 Null
 hypothesis
 were
consistently
 rejected
 at
 the
 selected
 level
 for
 significance
 (here:
p
 <
 .05).
3.
 Results
The
 analyses
 of
 the
 answers
 to
 the
 RRT-questions
 revealed
only
 results
 with
 a
 yes-cheater-estimation
 of
 zero.
 Therefore,
 the
algorithm
 for
 all
 the
 following
 analyses
 was
 equal
 to
 the
 no-
cheater-detection.
 This
 implies
 that
 the
 estimated
 rate
 of
 honest
no-responses
 can
 well
 be
 interpreted
 as
 unbiased
 concerning
cheating,
 while
 the
 estimation
 of
 honest
 yes-responses
 may
 be
inflated
 by
 yes-cheaters.
 Nevertheless,
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 estimation
of
 the
 share
 of
 yes-cheaters
 resulted
 in
 a
 zero
 proportion
 renders
this
 idea
 highly
 implausible.
3.1.
 Estimation
 of
 the
 last
 season
 prevalence
 of
 doping
The
 question
 “Have
 you
 intentionally
 used
 forbidden
 substances
and/or
 forbidden
 methods
 in
 order
 to
 enhance
 your
 sporting
 perfor-
mance
 in
 competitions
 during
 the
 last
 season?”
 was
 answered
 by
624
 respondents.
 The
 analysis
 resulted
 in
 a
 marginal
 case,
 estimat-
ing
 0%
 of
 honest
 yes-responders.
 The
 share
 of
 cheaters
 who
 did
 not
answer
 according
 to
 the
 RRT
 instructions
 was
 evaluated
 at
 30.6%.
The
 estimation
 of
 honest
 no-responders,
 another
 way
 to
 estimate
the
 rate
 of
 dopers,
 which
 is
 done
 independently
 from
 the
 estima-
tion
 of
 the
 honest
 yes-responders,
 estimated
 a
 percentage
 of
 69.4%.
The
 no-responders
 indicated
 that
 by
 maximum
 the
 rate
 of
 dopers
in
 Danish
 elite
 sport
 is
 30.6%.
 Please
 also
 see
 Table
 1.
 In
 sum,
 for
the
 last
 season
 doping
 prevalence,
 the
 maximum
 was
 estimated
 at
30.6%
 and
 the
 rate
 of
 honest
 non-dopers
 was
 estimated
 at
 69.4%.
3.2.
 Estimation
 of
 the
 overall
 lifetime
 prevalence
 of
 doping
For
 the
 question
 “Have
 you
 ever
 intentionally
 used
 forbidden
substances
 and/or
 forbidden
 methods
 in
 order
 to
 enhance
 your
sporting
 performance
 in
 competitions?”,
 581
 valid
 records
 were
retrieved.
 The
 estimators
 of
 honest
 yes,
 honest
 no
 and
 the
 remain-
ing
 percentage
 of
 cheaters,
 who
 did
 not
 answer
 according
 to
 the
 RRT
instruction
 is
 presented
 in
 Table
 1
 together
 with
 the
 95%
 confidence
intervals.
The
 rate
 of
 honest
 yes-responders
 was
 evaluated
 at
 3.1%.
Together
 with
 the
 percentage
 of
 cheaters,
 we  retrieved
 an
 interval
of
 at
 least
 3.1%
 and
 by
 maximum
 26%
 of
 lifetime
 users.
 Since
 the
estimated
 rate
 of
 honest
 no-responders
 for
 the
 lifetime
 prevalence
(74%)
 exceeded
 the
 estimated
 rate
 for
 the
 last
 season
 prevalence,
 a
bootstrap
 test
 was
 conducted.
 It
 revealed
 that
 the
 difference
 is
 not
significant.
 By
 and
 large,
 the
 results
 of
 the
 RRT
 questions-analyses
revealed
 a
 rate
 of
 at
 least
 3.1%
 dopers
 and
 by
 maximum
 26%
 and
a
 rate
 of
 74%
 who
 can
 reliably
 be
 estimated
 to
 have
 never
 doped
throughout
 their
 career.
3.3.
 Gender
 differences
For
 the
 RRT
 questions,
 a
 differential
 analysis
 by
 gender
 revealed
a
 prevalence
 of
 0
 honest
 yes-responders
 for
 both
 gender
 and
 a
 rate
of
 59.9%
 (male)
 and
 81.8%
 (female)
 honest
 no
 responders
 for
 the
last
 season
 question
 about
 doping.
 On
 a
 descriptive
 level,
 the
 esti-
mated
 rate
 of
 cheaters
 differed
 with
 more
 cheaters
 among
 male
than
 among
 female
 athletes.
 For
 the
 lifetime
 doping
 prevalence,
the
 7%
 honest
 yes-responders
 among
 male
 and
 0%
 among
 female
athletes
 and
 65.9%
 male
 honest
 no-responders
 and
 79.3%
 honest
no-responders
 among
 female
 athletes
 also
 indicated
 a
 different
 rate
of
 cheaters
 on
 a
 descriptive
 level.
 However,
 the
 differences
 failed
to
 reach
 statistical
 significance.
4.
 Discussion
That
 last
 season
 prevalence
 was
 identified
 to
 be
 higher
 than
lifetime
 prevalence
 seems
 to
 be
 an
 “impossible”
 result
 at
 first
glance.
 However,
 this
 result
 should
 not
 be
 over-interpreted.
 It
is
 caused
 by
 the
 fact
 that
 with
 this
 method,
 respondents
 who
are
 instructed
 to
 answer
 honestly
 to
 one
 of
 these
 questions
may,
 but
 must
 not
 be
 equally
 instructed
 for
 the
 other
 question.
Additionally,
 a
 bootstrap
 test
 revealed
 that
 the
 difference
 is
 not
significant.
 Although
 the
 method
 as
 well
 as
 the
 complete
 sur-
vey
 were
 designed
 to
 guarantee
 perfect
 anonymity
 especially
 for
the
 answers
 to
 the
 RRT,
 the
 analysis
 resulted
 in
 a
 marginal
 case,
estimating
 0%
 of
 honest
 yes-responders.
 By
 principle,
 we
 cannot
exclude
 that
 there
 might
 not
 have
 been
 a
 doping
 user
 in
 our
 sam-
ple.
 Nevertheless,
 in
 the
 light
 of
 other
 evidence,
 stemming
 from
the
 annual
 Danish
 doping
 test
 statistics
 (https://www.antidoping.

mations
 for
 the
 worldwide
 Anti
 Doping
 Test
 Regime
 (Pitsch,
 2013),
this
 is
 highly
 implausible.
 It
 is
 much
 more
 reasonable
 that
 our
 sur-
vey
 did
 not
 lead
 to
 enough
 trust
 among
 Danish
 elite
 athletes
 to
answer
 honestly.
 The
 share
 of
 respondents
 who
 did
 not
 answer
according
 to
 the
 RRT
 instructions
 was
 evaluated
 at
 30.6%.
 Compared
to
 other
 surveys
 where
 the
 same
 method
 was
 used,
 this
 level
 is
somewhat
 elevated
 (Pitsch
 &
 Emrich,
 2012;
 Pitsch,
 Emrich
 &
 Klein,
2007).
 This
 could
 be
 an
 indication
 that
 Danish
 elite
 athletes
 were
possibly
 more
 prone
 to
 obstruct
 the
 survey
 when
 answering
 this,
in
 fact,
 sensitive
 or
 even
 threatening
 question
 than
 athletes
 from
other
 countries
 while
 the
 Danish
 elite
 athletes
 were
 less
 prone
 to
answer
 honestly
 either
 yes
 or
 no.
A
 different
 critique
 of
 the
 validity
 of
 RRT-measured
 preva-
lence
 was
 based
 on
 the
 supposition
 that
 honest
 yes-rates
 could
be
 inflated
 by
 strategically
 tampering
 with
 the
 survey
 instrument
(James,
 Nepusz,
 Naughton
 &
 Petroczi,
 2013).
 As
 mentioned
 above,
the
 yes-cheater
 estimation
 for
 all
 the
 presented
 analyses
 resulted
exclusively
 in
 the
 marginal
 case
 of
 zero
 thus
 reducing
 the
 total
cheater
 detection
 to
 a
 no-cheater
 detection
 model.
 This
 means,
 that
in
 principle,
 the
 estimation
 of
 honest
 yes-responders
 can
 be
 inflated
by
 yes-cheaters,
 but
 the
 rate
 of
 this
 form
 of
 sabotage
 was
 so
 low
 that
it
 was
 not
 detectable.
 As
 the
 rate
 of
 no-cheaters
 is
 detected
 by
 this
method,
 the
 estimation
 of
 honest
 no-responders
 can
 be
 interpreted
as
 unbiased
 by
 cheating.
The
 differences
 in
 prevalence
 rates
 between
 the
 present
 survey
and
 former
 surveys
 in
 the
 Netherlands
 and
 in
 Germany
 seem
 to
be
 marginal
 and
 not
 significant.
 The
 recently
 published
 RRT
 study
by
 Duiven
 and
 de
 Hon
 (2015)
 on
 the
 prevalence
 of
 doping
 among
Dutch
 elite
 athletes
 revealed
 an
 overall
 prevalence
 of
 4.2%
 (95%
 CI
1.8%–8.5%)
 for
 lifetime
 doping
 usage.
 The
 estimated
 rate
 of
 honest
yes-responders
 among
 Danish
 elite
 athlete
 does
 not
 differ
 strongly
from
 this
 estimation.
 Unfortunately,
 due
 to
 the
 fact
 that
 in
 the
present
 study
 a
 different
 RRT-method
 was
 used
 than
 that
 used
 by
Duiven
 and
 de
 Hon,
 the
 other
 parameters
 cannot
 be
 compared.
 A
very
 similar
 method
 as
 in
 the
 present
 study
 was
 used
 by
 Pitsch
 and
Emrich
 (2012)
 among
 German
 elite
 athletes.
 A
 meticulous
 com-
parison,
 using
 bootstrap
 significance
 tests
 for
 all
 parameters
 which
were
 calculated
 in
 both
 studies
 revealed
 no
 significant
 differences
either
 for
 the
 last
 season
 or
 for
 the
 lifetime
 prevalence.
 By
 and
 large,
Danish
 elite
 athletes
 do
 not
 seem
 to
 differ
 from
 athletes
 in
 the
Netherlands
 or
 in
 Germany
 in
 terms
 of
 their
 doping
 prevalence.
They
 do,
 however,
 show
 much
 lower
 prevalence
 rates
 than
 those
of
 elite
 track
 and
 field
 athletes
 and
 participants
 in
 the
 Pan-Arab
games
 (Ulrich
 et
 al.,
 2018).
5.
 Conclusion
This
 is
 the
 first
 study
 to
 investigate
 doping
 prevalence
 in
 a
 sam-
ple
 of
 Danish
 elite
 athletes
 using
 RRT.
 Results
 indicate
 that
 doping
prevalence
 among
 Danish
 elite
 athletes
 is
 similar
 to
 that
 of
 Dutch
and
 German
 elite
 athletes.
 The
 data
 further
 suggest
 that
 Danish
 elite
athletes
 might
 have
 less
 trust
 in
 the
 RRT
 technique
 than
 athletes
from
 other
 countries.
