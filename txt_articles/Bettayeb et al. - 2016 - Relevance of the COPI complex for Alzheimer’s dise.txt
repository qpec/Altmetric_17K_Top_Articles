Cellular trafficking and recycling machineries belonging to late
secretory compartments have been associated with increased
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk. We have shown that coat protein
complex I (COPI)-dependent trafficking, an early step in Golgi-to-
endoplasmic reticulum retrograde transport, affects amyloid pre-
cursor protein subcellular localization, cell-surface expression, as
well as its metabolism. We present here a set of experiments dem-
onstrating that, by targeting subunit δ-COP function, the modera-
tion of the COPI-dependent trafficking in vivo leads to a significant
decrease in amyloid plaques in the cortex and hippocampus of
neurological 17 mice crossed with the 2xTg AD mouse model. Re-
markably, an improvement of the memory impairments was also
observed. Importantly, human genetic association studies of dif-
ferent AD cohorts led to the identification of 12 SNPs and 24 mu-
tations located in COPI genes linked to an increased AD risk. These
findings further demonstrate in vivo the importance of early traffick-
ing steps in AD pathogenesis and open new clinical perspectives.
COPI | Alzheimer | human genetic | EWAS studies | GWAS studies
O
ne of the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the ac-
cumulation of Aβ peptides that aggregate over time to form
oligomers and lead ultimately to amyloid plaques. Aβ peptides
result from cleavages of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) that
occur sequentially (1) and concomitantly with APP trafficking,
mainly from the plasma membrane to late endosomes (1, 2). We
recently addressed the possible involvement of early trafficking
steps and demonstrated that at least one subunit of coat protein
complex I (COPI), the main machinery underlying the retrograde
transport from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER), regulates APP trafficking, controlling its maturation and
consequently the production of Aβ peptides (3). These bio-
chemical and cellular findings demonstrate the physiological rel-
evance of the COPI complex in AD. All together, these results
indicate that the origin of the increased Aβ production in path-
ological conditions, when trafficking through the endocytic path-
way, might be due to APP maturation-state impairments.
Moreover, an in vivo model of impairment in COPI subunit
delta (δ-COP), the neurological 17 (Nur17) mouse, was pre-
viously developed (4) but not yet studied in the context of AD.
This mouse model represents a valuable and unique tool to
characterize the relevance of δ-COP in AD etiology. The
Nur17 mouse was generated by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)
mutagenesis, and positional cloning revealed that it carries a
T-to-C missense mutation in δ-COP, leading to partial dis-
ruption of intracellular trafficking.
Further highlighting the important role of trafficking in reg-
ulating Aβ production, in genome-wide association studies
(GWASs) essential components of cellular trafficking and recy-
cling involved in the endocytic or retromer pathways (endosome-
to-Golgi retrieval) have been found to be associated with
increased AD risk (5, 6).
In our previous study identifying δ-COP as a key regulator of
APP biology (3), we demonstrated that δ-COP silencing induced a
dramatic decrease of Aβ production in N2A cells. Toxicity of other
COPI subunits resulted in inconclusive results regarding their
possible influence on Aβ production. Prior studies suggest that the
complex as a whole could be important for AD etiology (7–9). We
next investigated the selectivity of COPI-dependent trafficking for
APP localization and its relevance in vivo, both by looking at am-
yloid plaque formation in an AD mouse model and, more impor-
tantly, by conducting a genetic study on four cohorts of AD patients.
Here we demonstrate that δ-COP regulates APP intracellular
trafficking rather selectively. Silencing of δ-COP induced a
stronger accumulation of APP in the early secretory pathway
(Golgi–ER) compared with three other proteins important for
APP metabolism. Moreover, cell-surface APP is significantly
decreased after δ-COP silencing, whereas eight other proteins
relevant for this study were not significantly affected. In an
in vivo AD model crossed with Nur17 mice, reduction of δ-COP
function rescues AD pathology by significantly decreasing amy-
loid plaque load as well as improving memory impairments.
Importantly, we report that 12 single-nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) located in COPI genes are genetically associated with
AD risk. Analysis of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data
identified mutations in each COPI gene initially linked to AD
through SNP analysis. Altogether, our findings demonstrate the
physiological relevance of the COPI complex in AD pathogen-
esis, a link further confirmed by our clinical data.

Significance
Late secretory compartments are clearly associated with increased
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk. We have shown biochemically and
in cells that coat protein complex I (COPI)-dependent trafficking,
an early Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum trafficking step, modifies
amyloid precursor protein subcellular localization and cell-surface
expression, leading to an altered metabolism. The work pre-
sented here demonstrates that a reduced COPI-dependent traf-
ficking in vivo leads to a decrease in the amyloid plaque burden in
an AD mouse model, and to an improvement of some memory
impairments observed in these mice. Remarkably, human genetic
association studies of different AD cohorts led to the identifica-
tion of genetic markers (SNPs) and mutations in COPI genes linked
with an increased AD risk. These results demonstrate in vivo the
importance of COPI and early trafficking steps in AD.

 its maturation, and consequently the production of Aβ peptides.
We compared the effect of δ-COP silencing in N2a cells
transfected with APP wild type (APP-WT) and APP containing
the Swedish mutation (APP-SW). δ-COP silencing decreased
Aβ40 levels in a similar manner in both systems (Fig. 1 A and
B). δ-COP silencing also decreased endogenous Aβ40 pro-
duction in nontransfected N2a cells (Fig. 1C). We also showed
that δ-COP silencing affects the amount of APP associated with
the Golgi apparatus (3). Here, using sucrose gradient experi-
ments, we investigated the effect of δ-COP silencing on Golgi-
localized proteins (e.g., γ-adaptin) or proteins relevant for APP
metabolism (PS1, BACE, and ADAM10). The two main Golgi-
containing fractions are shown and were used for quantification
purposes. Depletion of δ-COP had a negligible effect on
γ-adaptin (increased 1.2-fold in the Golgi apparatus) (Fig. 1D),
indicating that the Golgi apparatus had not been broadly
compromised.

the
amount of PS1, BACE, and ADAM10 associated with the
Golgi apparatus (1.57-, 1.56-, and 2.18-fold, respectively)
compared with APP (5.74-fold in the Golgi apparatus) (Fig.
1D). Using APP biotinylation assays, we previously showed that
δ-COP silencing dramatically decreased the amount of APP at
the cell surface (3). Here we demonstrated that this effect was
relatively specific for APP as the amount of Notch [gamma-
secretase substrate that has a half-life comparable to APP (10,
11)], two other cargo proteins of the COPI complex (NMDAR
and Na,K-ATPase) (12, 13), as well as two resident proteins of
the cell surface (E-cadherin and syndecan) were unchanged
(Fig. 1 E and F). Noticeably, the levels of PS1, BACE, and
ADAM10 were also unchanged (Fig. 1 E and F).
Aβ Peptide Levels, Amyloid Plaque Density, and Memory Impairment
Are Reduced in AD/δ-COP Mutant Mice. The potential relevance of
δ-COP in the pathogenesis of AD was then explored in vivo with
mice that harbor a single mutation leading to a partially inactive
δ-COP (nur17), referred to in this study as δ-COP mutant (δ-COP
mut) mice (δ-COP knockout is lethal) (4). We measured Aβ40
levels in δ-COP mut mice compared with δ-COP WT mice and
found that, after quantification, Aβ40 levels were not significantly
reduced. However, when crossed with the double-transgenic AD
mouse model 2xTg (APP Swedish, PS1Δ9 mutations), δ-COP
mutant mice displayed a significant reduction in the levels of Aβ40
and Aβ42 in the hippocampus at 5 and 9 mo of age (Fig. 2A). At
5 mo of age, the total level of APP was unchanged in AD/δ-COP
mut mice compared with AD/δ-COP WT mice (Fig. 2B). Amyloid
plaque development was significantly reduced in the hippocampus
(52.5 ± 4.7%) in 9-mo-old δ-COP mutant mice (Fig. 3 and Fig.
S1A). The number of amyloid plaques in the hippocampus was
grouped and quantified according to size. The most prominent
reduction was observed for the larger plaques (diameter >60 μm;
88.2 ± 3.5%) (Fig. 3B). Amyloid plaque development was also
reduced in the piriform cortex in a comparable manner to the
hippocampus (44.6 ± 6.4%) in 9-mo-old δ-COP mutant mice (Fig.
4 and Fig. S1B). The most prominent reduction was also observed
for the larger plaques in that region (diameter >60 μm; 60.0 ±
13.9%) (Fig. 4B). We next investigated whether partially inactive
δ-COP also influences the memory of AD mice using the novel
object recognition test. To ensure that the δ-COP mutation does
not interfere with the ability to perform this memory test, we
compared WT mice with δ-COP mut mice in a non-AD back-
ground. Both groups of animals spent significantly more time with
the novel object compared with the familiar object, indicating that
δ-COP mut mice could perform the task as well as WT mice (Fig.
5A). We also confirmed that novel object recognition was im-
paired in the 2xTg mice at 9 mo of age, as reported previously
(Fig. 5B, Left) (14). Importantly, the partial loss of δ-COP func-
tion rescued the capacity to discriminate novel versus familiar
objects in AD/δ-COP mut mice compared with AD/δ-COP WT
mice (Fig. 5 B and C), which was consistent with plaque load re-
duction and decrease of Aβ production in these mice.
Several SNPs and Variants Are Associated with AD in Multiple COPI
Genes. To determine whether COPI complex components are risk
factors for AD, we investigated the possible association of SNPs
located in the vicinity of COPI genes with AD (Table S1). The
National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Genetics Initiative
Alzheimer’s Disease Study (15, 16), originally ascertained for the
study of genetic risk factors in AD with family-based methods, was
used in the WGS analyses in this study. The basis for ascertain-
ment in the NIMH collection was at least two affected individuals
within a family, typically siblings. The complete NIMH study cohort
contains a total of 1,536 subjects from 457 families. For the purpose
of this analysis, only subjects of self-reported European ancestry
were included, consisting of 1,345 participants (941 affected and
404 unaffected) from 410 families. Meta-analysis of six independent
study cohorts within the candidate gene regions of the COPI
complex revealed several SNPs that are associated with AD (Table
1 and Table S2). Seven SNP association signals approached sta-
tistical significance (P < 5 × 10−4). The most-significant associa-
tions (with meta-P values between 0.002 and 7.E-04) were
observed in the COPI subunit delta gene region (COPD;
two SNPs), COPI subunit alpha (COPA), COPI subunit zeta 1
(COPZ1), and COPI subunit zeta 2 (COPZ2; three SNPs)
(Table 1 and bolded SNPs in Table S2). Five candidate COPI
genes (the four genes mentioned above plus COPI subunit beta
1; COPB1) exhibit nominally significant association (P < 0.05)
with AD. Interestingly, across the six studies, the SNPs are
mainly associated with an increased risk of AD (Table 1 and
Tables S2 and S3).
We then searched for rare and highly penetrant variants in
the WGS data for the COPI complex in 410 AD families, where
no other previously known AD mutations could be established
as genetic risk factors. We limited our search to variants that
are predicted to have a significant impact on gene functionality
based on publicly available algorithms (i.e., KEGG, SIFT,
PolyPhen2, HPRD, CADD, fitcon score catalogs) (17). In total,
we identified 24 variants across the nine COPI genes. In-
terestingly, eight COPI genes (the five genes that exhibit SNPs

display alternate variants that segregate with the disease in the
carrier families (Table 2 and Table S4). These variants might be
responsible for AD or serve as drivers of pathology in the
carrier families.
Discussion
The discovery of a genetic link between several subunits of the
COPI complex and AD in humans and the confirmation of the
importance of the COPI complex in amyloid plaque burden and
memory impairments in an AD mouse model strongly support
the importance of the COPI complex in APP processing and
amyloidogenesis.
The important reduction in beta amyloid plaques observed in
AD/δ-COP mutant mice, although not complete, induces a signifi-
cant behavioral improvement compared with AD mice. These re-
sults are in agreement with other studies showing that a strong
reduction of amyloid plaques is sufficient to translate into behavioral
consequences without necessarily requiring a total clearance of the
plaques (18–20).
Numerous AD mouse models have been developed over the
years with different degrees of success, especially when consid-
ering cognitive impairments. We chose to work with one of the
broadly used AD mouse models, namely the 2xTg model. The
ataxic condition observed in Nur17 mice, a condition slightly wors-
ening with age, did not allow us to fully explore all cognitive functions
typically measured in mice. We described here the use of the novel
object recognition test, as we showed by comparing WT mice with
δ-COP mut mice that both cohorts spent significantly more time with
the novel object compared with the familiar object, indicating that the
general condition of δ-COP mut mice was compatible with this test.
More importantly, we showed that the partial loss of δ-COP activity
rescued the capacity to discriminate novel versus familiar objects in
AD/δ-COP mut mice, consistent with plaque load reduction and
decrease of Aβ production in these mice. The AD 2xTg mice de-
velop cognitive impairments at a relatively advanced age (12 mo). It
would be interesting to evaluate the impact of δ-COP function on
other cognitive aspects, and this could perhaps be achieved in AD
mouse models developing cognitive impairments earlier, such as 3xTg
or 5xFAD.
In terms of therapeutic application, due to the biological im-
portance of COPI in general and δ-COP specifically (mice partially
lacking δ-COP activity display some phenotypes, such as ataxia),
any therapeutic intervention targeting the COPI complex will have
to target this biological function rather moderately and/or in-
directly, perhaps just occasionally, to circumvent issues similar to
the ones raised using γ-secretase inhibitors (21). To achieve selec-
tivity, it may be possible to identify and target a regulator of APP
trafficking through COPI.
The fact that several members of the COPI complex are as-
sociated with AD risk in our genetic studies reinforces the
importance of the COPI pathway for AD progression, as found
for several subunits of the γ-secretase complex. It is important
to note that, in small late-onset families, unaffected family
members are often not available and in almost all cases the rare
functional variants are either novel or have never been ob-
served in control subjects. As a consequence of the scarcity,
in the databases, of individuals carrying the mutation, it is ex-
ceedingly rare to reach significance and the mutations identi-
fied require full characterization. However, we note that even
with APP and PSEN1/2, we have observed families with mixed
genetic etiologies in which all affected patients do not carry the
pathogenic mutation. For future work, it will be interesting to
test the relevance for AD of each of the variants identified
genetically in several COPI subunits to ascertain their bi-
ological role in the progression of the disease.
In summary, we are providing evidence confirming the rele-
vance of COPI for AD pathology in vivo, in a mouse model of
AD, where we showed that both the burden of plaques and
plaque-related memory impairments can be improved after re-
ducing δ-COP activity. This notion has been further confirmed
using a genetic approach, studying four different cohorts of hu-
man patients and identifying several associations between dif-
ferent COPI subunits and AD. Altogether, the in vivo data
presented here in combination with our previous findings (3)
unveil new avenues for therapeutic interventions.

 the δ-COP subunit or nontargeting control siRNA was purchased from Thermo
Fisher Scientific.
Sequences for δ-COP siRNA are as follows: sense sequence: 5′-GGAGAA-
UGUUAACCUGGCAUU-3′; and antisense sequence: 5′-P-UGCCAGGUUAAC-
AUUCUCCUU-3′.
Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) was used for all transient trans-
fections. Mammalian expression vectors used for protein overexpression
were purchased from GeneCopoeia. Constructs were based on a pReceiver-
M07 plasmid, and cDNAs were tagged with a C-terminal HA sequence.
pcDNA4-β-CTF expression vector was a kind gift from Y.-M. Li, Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, and pcDNA3-APP was provided by
H. Rebholz, The City College of New York, New York.
Aβ Quantification. For cell cultures, the medium was replaced 6 h before
collecting supernatants for Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptide measurements. Aβ levels
were normalized to total protein levels. For in vivo experiments, brains were
dissected on ice, homogenized in 70% (vol/vol) formic acid solution, and
sonicated, and homogenates were centrifuged for 1 h at 180,000 × g. The
supernatants were collected and neutralized with 1 M Tris base. The concen-
trations of the Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides were determined using the sandwich
ELISA technique (Life Technologies).
Western Blotting Analysis and Antibodies. Protein samples were analyzed by
SDS/PAGE and Western blot after BCA quantification. Antibodies used were
APP-CTF (in house and Abcam), γ-adaptin (BD Biosciences), β-actin, Na,
K-ATPase (Cell Signaling Technology), PS1 (in house) ADAM10 (Abcam), and
BACE (Abcam). HA antibody for immunoprecipitation (GenScript) and HA
antibody for Western blotting (Roche) were used.
Subcellular Fractionation. Subcellular fractionation was performed as pre-
viously described (3). Briefly, cells were homogenized in a sucrose buffer
(0.25 M sucrose) using a ball-bearing cell cracker. Homogenates were sepa-
rated on a sucrose gradient (0.25–2 M sucrose) by centrifugation (2.5 h at
250,000 × g). Fractions corresponding to the Golgi were analyzed by SDS/
PAGE and Western blotting using the corresponding antibodies for APP-CTF,
actin, γ-adaptin, PS1, ADAM10, and BACE (see above).
Cell-Surface Biotinylation. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and incubated
with Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C.
Biotin solution was then removed and cells were washed once with 50 mM
Tris and twice with ice-cold PBS.
Precipitation of Biotinylated Proteins. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer followed
by centrifugation (10,000 × g) and lysates were mixed with streptavidin-
Dynabeads (Life Technologies). After an hour of incubation at 4 °C, the
beads were washed five times with ice-cold PBS/0.01% Tween. Biotinylated
proteins were resolved by SDS/PAGE and analyzed by Western blot with
different antibodies as indicated in the text.
Mouse Strains. δ-COP wild-type and δ-COP mutant mice (mixed background
of C57BL/6J and 129S6/SvEvTac) were kindly provided by A. Ikeda from the
Baylor College of Medicine, Houston. The mutation was identified previously
as a single-nucleotide substitution in δ-COP (4). These mice were crossed with
the 2xTg AD mouse model (APPswe; PS1ΔE9) (Jackson Laboratory) for Aβ
analyses and behavioral experiments.
Amyloid Plaque Analysis from Mouse Brain Immune-Labeled Sections. Mouse
brains were fixed in 4% (vol/vol) paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy
Sciences), washed with PBS, and incubated with different solutions of sucrose.
Brains were then frozen on dry ice with freezing medium and sliced coronally
in sections of 40 μm. Sections were labeled with Aβ antibody (6E10). Plaques
from nine slices per animal were counted.
Behavioral Characterization. Procedures were adapted from a previously
described protocol (4). All procedures were approved by The Rockefeller
University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee animal in-
stitutional review board and performed accordingly. Briefly, the task
was conducted in a clear Plexiglas open arena (58 × 58 × 46 cm3) using
two objects (a 50-mL Falcon tube and a Lego object constructed of two
Lego pieces: one square piece centered and attached to the top of one
rectangular piece). The task consisted of three phases: habituation,
sample, and choice, conducted successively. During habituation, the
mouse was placed in the empty arena and allowed to freely explore for
5 min. The sample phase was conducted 24 h later. Two identical objects
were fixed to the floor in the northeast and southeast corners of the box
(10 cm from the wall) and the mice were allowed to explore for 10 min.
Half of the mice in each group were randomly presented with either the
Falcon tube or the Lego object during the sample phase. The choice
phase was conducted 1 h after the sample phase. One familiar object
(identical to that used in the sample phase) and one novel object were
placed in the northeast and southeast corners of the box and the mice
were allowed to explore for 5 min. The location of the novel object was
counterbalanced across groups. The arena and objects were cleaned
with 30% (vol/vol) alcohol between each phase. EthoVision tracking
software (Noldus Information Technology) was used during the task.
Object exploration was manually scored in real time using a computer
keyboard. Object exploration was scored only when the mouse’s nose
touched the object.

 Human Genetic SNP Association Study.
Family-based study samples. Candidate gene analysis was performed on the
National Institute of Mental Health Genetics Initiative Alzheimer’s Disease
Study family sample (6, 15) and the National Cell Repository for Alzheimer’s
Disease (NCRAD) family sample (study sample characteristics are available at
https://www.ncrad.org). Only families of self-reported Caucasian ethnicity
from each study sample were included in these analyses. Recruitment for
each study was based on families containing at least two affected siblings;
most families are typically composed of multiple siblings. The NIMH cohort
contains 1,186 subjects from 387 families and the NCRAD cohort contains
954 subjects from 354 families (Table S2). The genotypes from both familial
cohorts used to derive imputation-based genotypes were generated with
the Affymetrix 6.0 SNP array.
Case-control study samples. The four case-control cohorts included in these
analyses are the Genetics Alzheimer’s Disease Association Study sample
(GenADA; GlaxoSmithKline) (22), the Translational Genomics Research
Institute Study sample (TGEN2; https://www.tgen.org), the National In-
stitute on Aging Genetics Initiative for Late Onset Alzheimer’s Disease
Family Study sample (23) (NIA-LOAD), and the Alzheimer’s Disease Neu-
roimaging Initiative Study sample (ADNI; https://aibl.csiro.au/adni). In

 total, the case-control cohorts contain 2,277 cases and 2,378 controls of
self-reported Caucasian ethnicity (Table S2).
Data Analysis. Genotype imputation was carried out with the IMPUTE2 al-
gorithm (24); we used the most recent release of the integrated 1,000 Ge-
nomes Project data as the reference population (mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/
impute/data_download_1000G_phase1_integrated.html).
Selection of Independent Markers. To determine the number of independent
(i.e., linkage equilibrium) SNPs available for association testing from each of
the COPI gene regions (plus 20 kb from the 3′ UTR and 5′ UTR), we used a
pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) test approach implemented in Haploview
(version 4.2) software (https://www.broadinstitute.org/scientific-community/
science/programs/medical-and-population-genetics/haploview/haploview),
whereby all alleles captured are highly correlated (r2 > 0.8) to a minimal set of
tag SNPs. After imputation, a total of 530 SNPs were available among the
eight COP genes (Table S2). The LD structure for selecting the tag SNPs was
based on genotypes derived by imputation from 387 unrelated affected
NIMH subjects. SNPs that deviated from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (P <
0.0001) or imputed SNPs with information scores less than 40% or that had a
minor allele frequency less than 0.01 (imputation accuracy is generally poor
for rare alleles) in our NIMH AD patient subset were excluded from the LD
analysis (34 SNPs removed, 6%; Table S3). These analyses led to a total of 96
independent SNPs among the eight COP gene regions (Table S2).
Statistical Analysis. To assess for allelic association within the two family-
based samples among our eight candidate gene regions, we used an ex-
tension (25) of the family-based association analysis test (FBAT) approach
implemented in PBAT (version 3.6). The FBAT approach evaluates whether
the minor allele is over- or undertransmitted (i.e., risk or protection) in af-
fected offspring compared with the expected distribution under Mendel’s
law of segregation. FBAT identifies association as well as linkage and
minimizes false positive associations due to population stratification. FBAT
analysis was performed only on SNPs with at least 10 informative families in
each of the two family studies. An additive genetic model was assumed for
both family-based and case-control association analysis. We report P values
from the Liptak test statistic, which uses all available information. The Liptak
method attains higher power levels than the traditional FBAT approach by
combining the Z statistics that correspond to the P values of the family-based
test (the within-family information) with the rank-based P values for population-
based analysis (the between-family information).
To assess for allelic association in the case-control datasets, we per-
formed logistic regression analysis, adjusting for known confounds such
as sex, age, and population structure, as implemented in the SNPTEST
(version 2) software package (https://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/genetics_
software/snptest/old/snptest.html). Principal component analysis was
performed with EIGENSTRAT (genepath.med.harvard.edu/∼reich/EIGENSTRAT.
htm) to assess population structure, and the first three principal components
were included as covariates in the logistic model. As an overall summary measure
of association, we performed a meta-analysis of the test results from the two
family-based studies (NIMH and NCRAD) plus the four case-control studies
(GenADA, TGEN2, NIA-LOAD, and ADNI) using the statistical package METAL
(https://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/metal). Agnostic analyses of total GWAS
datasets generally require a Bonferroni correction of 5 × 10−8. Because a limited
set of gene candidates and their SNPs (96 SNPs) were chosen to test for associ-
ation with AD, an experimental-wide Bonferroni correction for 96 independent
tests was required (P < 5 × 10−4).
Human Genetic Variant Association Study.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents. Diagnosis of AD
dementia was established according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria (National
Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the
Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association). Informed consent
was provided by all participants, and research approval was established by
the relevant institutional review boards in the study cohort. No human
samples were generated or used for this study; instead only databases
generated previously were used, and therefore institutional review board
approval was not necessary.
WGS data generation. Three micrograms of total genomic DNA (150 ng/μL)
obtained from the Cell and DNA Repository, Rutgers University was se-
quenced at Illumina using their latest HiSeq 2500 paired-end sequencing
platform. An average of 48-fold coverage of 98% of the genome was ob-
served in the resulting 120-Gb data from each sample. Genomic variants
were called in-house using FreeBayes (version 0.9.9.2-18) and the Genome
Analysis Toolkit (GATK) best practices method (26), resulting in close to
400 Tb of high-quality sequencing data. A fully annotated GEMINI database
(17) with additional information (e.g., functional effect predictions) was
created for querying specific genes and loci for analysis purposes (https://
bcbio.wordpress.com/2013/10/21/updated-comparison-of-variant-detection-
methods-ensemble-freebayes-and-minimal-bam-preparation-pipelines/).
