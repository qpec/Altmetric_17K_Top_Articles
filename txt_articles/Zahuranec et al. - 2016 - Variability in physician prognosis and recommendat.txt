Variability in physician prognosis and
recommendations after intracerebral
hemorrhage
ABSTRACT
Objective: To assess physician prognosis and treatment recommendations for intracerebral hem-
orrhage (ICH) and to determine the effect of providing physicians a validated prognostic score.
Methods: A written survey with 2 ICH scenarios was completed by practicing neurologists and
neurosurgeons. Selected factors were randomly varied (patient older vs middle age, Glasgow
Coma Scale [GCS] score 7T vs 11, and presence vs absence of a validated prognostic score).
Outcomes included predicted 30-day mortality and recommendations for initial treatment inten-
sity (6-point scale ranging from 1 5 comfort only to 6 5 full treatment).
Results: A total of 742 physicians were included (mean age 52, 32% neurosurgeons, 17%
female). Physician predictions of 30-day mortality varied widely (mean [range] for the 4 possible
combinations of age and GCS were 23% [0%–80%], 35% [0%–100%], 48% [0%–100%], and
58% [5%–100%]). Treatment recommendations also varied widely, with responses encompass-
ing the full range of response options for each case. No physician demographic or personality
characteristics were associated with treatment recommendations. Providing a prognostic score
changed treatment recommendations, and the effect differed across cases. When the prognostic
score suggested 0% chance of functional independence (76-year-old with GCS 7T), the likelihood
of treatment limitations was increased (odds ratio [OR] 1.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12–
2.33) compared to no prognostic score. Conversely, if the score suggested a 66% chance of
independence (63-year-old with GCS 11), treatment limitations were less likely (OR 0.62, 95%
CI 0.43–0.88).
Conclusions: Physicians vary substantially in ICH prognostic estimates and treatment recommen-
dations. This variability could have a profound effect on life and death decision-making and treat-
ment for ICH. Neurology® 2016;86:1864–1871

Substantial heterogeneity has been identified in use of do-not-resuscitate orders and life-
sustaining treatments after stroke.1–4 There are many potential sources of this observed variabil-
ity in end-of-life treatment at the patient, physician, and health system level.1,5–7 The physician
estimation and communication of the patient’s prognosis for recovery is a critical first step to
setting a treatment plan for patients with severe stroke such as intracerebral hemorrhage
(ICH).8–10 Many prognostic scores have been developed for ICH,11,12 though there has been
almost no formal evaluation of the utility and effect of these prognostic scores on physician
behavior or patient-level outcomes.9,13
To develop a better understanding of current physician practice patterns for ICH prognos-
tication and treatment recommendations, we conducted a nationwide survey of neurologists
and neurosurgeons regarding the management of ICH. The primary objectives of this study
were to (1) identify the physician- and patient-level determinants of variability in prognostic

METHODS Physician
identification
and
survey
distribution. Physicians were identified based on a simple
random sample of actively practicing physicians with a spe-
cialty of neurology, vascular neurology, or neurosurgery from
the American Medical Association Masterfile. Written versions of
the survey were sent via US mail along with an introductory letter,
$2 cash incentive, and a prepaid return envelope. Follow-up surveys
(no incentive) were sent to nonresponders after approximately
8 weeks. Surveys were distributed on August 27, 2013, and
October 23, 2013. Completed surveys were collected and
manually double-entered using REDCap electronic data capture
tools hosted at the University of Michigan.14
Case scenarios. Each survey included 2 case vignettes describing
a patient presenting with ICH. Each vignette provided a clinical
description of symptoms, examination findings, representative
slices from a noncontrast CT scan, and an estimate of the total
hemorrhage volume. Patient characteristics were randomized
within physician including patient age (older vs middle age), race
(African American vs Caucasian), and severity of neurologic def-
icits (severe vs moderate). One case was intended to be of mod-
erate severity, describing a woman (age randomized to 83 or 63
years) on warfarin for atrial fibrillation who presented with right
hemiparesis and aphasia, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 11
(eye 3, verbal 2, motor 6), and a hemorrhage volume of 45 mL.
The other case was more severe, describing a woman (age ran-
domized to 76 or 56 years) who was found minimally responsive
and intubated in the emergency department with a GCS of 7T
(eye 2, verbal 1T, motor 4), and a hemorrhage volume of
120 mL with intraventricular extension.
In half of the surveys, the results from a validated prognostic
score (FUNC score12) were shown after each case (“One validated
predictive model for ICH suggests that patients of similar severity
have about a X% chance of returning to functional independence
by 90 days,” where X was 0%, 13%, or 66% depending on the
age and GCS). Randomization of the prognostic score was per-
formed such that each physician saw the prognostic score for both
cases or for neither case to avoid contamination within a survey.
This design resulted in a total of 16 versions of the survey. An
overview of the randomization of vignettes is shown in figure 1,
with full details of the randomization and full text from the case
vignettes shown in appendix e-1 and table e-1 on the Neurology®
Web site at Neurology.org.
Outcome measures. After each case, the physicians estimated
the patient’s probability of 30-day mortality as well as 90-day
return to functional independence (both free text write-in from
0% to 100%). Physicians were then told that the family was
uncertain about the level of intensity of treatment to provide, and
that the family specifically asked for the physician’s recommendation
for the initial intensity of treatment. Physicians then indicated their
recommended initial intensity of treatment on a 6-point ordinal scale
with anchors of 1 5 comfort measures and 6 5 full intensive
treatment (see appendix e-1 for text of questions and response
options).
Physician characteristics. After the cases, additional questions
assessed physician demographics, practice setting, optimism,15 reli-
gious salience,16 religious attendance, religious affiliation, and empathy
(“How do you think your patients would rate your level of empathy as
compared to other physicians?” with response options of “I’m much
less empathetic,” “I’m a little less empathetic,” “I’m about average,”
“I’m a little more empathetic,” and “I’m much more empathetic”).
Statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to summa-
rize the physician characteristics. Repeated measures regression
models with robust standard errors were used for all outcomes
(linear for mortality and functional independence; ordinal and
logistic for treatment recommendations) to account for clustering
of responses within physicians. Model covariates were prespeci-
fied. All patient characteristics (age, GCS, and race) as well as case
order were included in all models. Interaction terms between
patient-level variables and case order were explored and retained
if significant at p , 0.10 to account for order effects. Physician
variables included age (quartiles), sex, race/ethnicity (other vs
non-Hispanic white), number of ICH cases seen in the prior
12 months (16 or more, none, reference 1–15), surgeon,
academic practice, geographic region, empathy, optimism, and
religious importance. The presence (vs absence) of the prognostic
score was coded as a 5-item categorical variable (no prognosis
provided 5 reference; each of the 4 possible combinations of age
and GCS) since the effect of the prognostic score was found to be
different for different cases (e.g., the effect of showing a 0% chance
of recovery was different than showing a 13% or a 66% chance).
This approach allowed the effect of the prognostic score to be
evaluated both overall and on a per-case basis. An interaction
term between age and severity was forced into all models so that
prognostic score could be interpreted adjusting for the joint effects
of age and severity.
For the analysis of physician treatment recommendations, the
a priori plan was to treat this as a 6-item ordinal variable. An ini-
tial ordinal model was created adjusting only for patient factors to
allow us to determine the effect of the prognostic score on the full
ordinal scale. However, once physician factors were added to the
model, the proportional hazards assumption was violated. There-
fore, a second logistic model was created where responses were
collapsed into 2 categories (responses of 1, 2, or 3 indicating treat-
ment limitations vs 4, 5, or 6 indicating full treatment) and phy-
sician characteristics were added. Analyses were conducted with
SAS software version 9.3 for Windows (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. This study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of the University of Michigan and determined to be
exempt from ongoing review.
RESULTS The survey was mailed to 4,000 randomly
selected physicians. Completed surveys were received
from 816, with 273 returned as undeliverable or inel-
igible, for a response rate of 816/3,727 (22%). Of the
816, another 74 had missing data on one or more key
descriptive variables, leaving 742 available for full anal-
ysis. Cases excluded for missing data did not differ on
responses for the study outcome measures. The charac-
teristics of the study population are shown in table 1.
The distribution of predicted 30-day mortality by
patient age and GCS is shown in figure 2, demonstrat-
ing a wide range of responses within each clinical sce-
nario. The multivariable model for physician-predicted
30-day mortality is shown in table 2. Older (vs middle)
patient age increased the mortality estimate by 7–10
percentage points, while the effect of higher severity
(GCS 7T vs 11) ranged from 18 to 29 percentage

 points. Patient race had no effect on mortality predic-
tions. Providing a prognostic score altered the physi-
cians’ predictions of mortality (p 5 0.001). This
effect was seen primarily in the case of the 63-year-old
patient with a GCS of 11, where the prognostic score
(66% chance of independence) resulted in a 5-point
decrease in the mortality estimate (p , 0.001).
Several physician factors were associated with mor-
tality estimates (table 2), with surgeons providing
a lower mortality estimate by 10 percentage points than
nonsurgeons. Number of ICH cases seen in the prior
12 months also had an effect, with physicians who saw
16 or more ICH cases tending to predict a higher
mortality by 4 percentage points than those who saw
1 to 15 cases. Physicians in the Northeast and Southern
regions of the United States predicted a higher chance
of death than those in the Western United States.
Overall, the within-physician correlation in responses
was 0.26, suggesting that physician factors were
responsible for 26% of the outcome variance. The final
model R2 was 0.32 (i.e., the model explained 32% of
the variability in physician responses).
Results for the physician estimates of 90-day recov-
ery are detailed in appendix e-2 and table e-2. Providing
physicians with a prognostic score affected physician
predictions (p , 0.001), with favorable prognostic
score (66% predicted independence) associated with
increased physician estimates of good outcome, while
a poor prognostic score (0% predicted independence)
decreased physician estimates of good outcome. The
only physician-level variable associated with prediction
of 90-day recovery was geographic region (p 5 0.02).
Results for the multivariable models investigating
treatment recommendations are shown in table e-3,
with the effect of the prognostic score shown in figure
3. When treatment recommendations were investi-
gated as a 6-point ordinal variable, providing a prog-
nostic score changed physicians’ recommendations
(p , 0.001). This effect varied depending on what
probability of recovery was shown by the prognostic

 score. For the cases where the chance of recovery was
shown to be 13%, the prognostic score had no effect
on treatment recommendations. However, if the prog-
nostic score suggested a 0% chance of functional recov-
ery (76-year-old patient with GCS 7T), the likelihood
of treatment limitations was increased (adjusted odds
ratio [OR] 1.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12–
2.33, p 5 0.01, adjusted for patient age, race, GCS,
case order, age 3 GCS, and order 3 GCS). Con-
versely, if the score suggested a 66% chance of recovery
(63-year-old patient with GCS 11), the likelihood of
treatment limitations was decreased (adjusted OR
0.62, 95% CI 0.43–0.88, p 5 0.008, adjusted for
same factors as above). Patient race was not associated
with treatment recommendations in the ordinal model
(adjusted OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85–1.17, p 5 0.99).
When treatment recommendations were collapsed
into 2 categories (limited vs full treatment) to allow
the exploration of physician characteristics, none of
the investigated physician factors was associated with
recommendations. Physicians recommended a lower
treatment intensity (response of 1, 2, or 3 on the
6-point scale) in 32% of cases. The prognostic score
remained associated with treatment recommenda-
tions, with a similar pattern of responses as the ordi-
nal model (e.g., 66% chance of independence
decreased treatment limitations, while a 0% chance
showed a trend toward increased treatment limita-
tions, see table e-3). African American patient race
was not associated with physician recommendations
for treatment limitations (adjusted OR 0.82, 95%
CI 0.66–1.03, p 5 0.09) in the binary model,
adjusted for patient and physician characteristics.
DISCUSSION We identified substantial variability in
physician prognostic estimates and treatment recom-
mendations for cases of moderate to severe ICH. This
variability existed despite providing sufficient clinical
data to estimate chances of death or recovery based on
commonly used ICH prognostic models.12,17 We also
found that physician recommendations for initial
treatment intensity were altered when they were pro-
vided with a validated prognostic score. If the prog-
nostic score suggested a poor outcome (0% chance of
90-day independence), physicians were more likely
to recommend treatment limitations compared with
no prognostic score. If the prognostic score suggested
a
favorable
outcome
(66%
chance
of
90-day
independence),
physicians
were
less
likely
to
recommend treatment limitations.
These findings have several implications. First,
they suggest that prognostic information provided
to a family about an ICH patient may vary depending
on the particular physician involved in the case.
Given the widespread variability seen in ICH end-
of-life treatment seen across institutions,1 it is likely
that differences in physician prognostication and rec-
ommendations play at least some role in unwanted
variability in ICH treatment. Overly optimistic and
overly pessimistic prognostic estimates can both have
deleterious effects. Overly optimistic recommenda-
tions can lead to continuation of futile treatments
and leave family members unprepared for death or
poor outcome, while overly pessimistic predictions
can lead to early treatment limitations and death in
individuals who may have had a chance for
recovery.

 Our results also suggest that increased use of vali-
dated prognostic scores may alter physician treatment
recommendations in certain cases. While encouraging
use of prognostic scores could be seen as a way to
reduce unwanted variability in ICH treatment, there
was still a wide range of treatment recommendations
even when physicians were provided with a prognostic
score. Furthermore, the prognostic score had no effect
on treatment recommendations in the 2 cases with
intermediate prognosis (13%) for functional recov-
ery. Despite the wide availability of prognostic mod-
els for ICH,12,17 few are currently used in practice.
Reasons for this are complex and likely due to multiple
factors including lack of physician trust in models,
difficulty in applying population average estimates to
individual patients, and a belief that numbers may be
misinterpreted by families.18 Physicians tend to be
reluctant to provide numeric prognostic estimates,
and yet studies of surrogate decision-makers suggest
that the majority of surrogates understand and accept
the inherent uncertainty in these estimates and still
want numeric estimates if they are available.18,19 Exist-
ing prognostic models for ICH may also be biased as
they have been developed in cohorts with frequent
decisions to limit life-sustaining treatments, which
were in part based on prognostic variables incorporated
into the scores.20,21 Since chart documentation of an
ICH severity score is now an emerging quality metric
for ICH and use of prognostic scores is likely to
increase,22 more formal study of the effect of these
scores on patient outcomes seems warranted.13
We identified relatively few physician characteris-
tics associated with outcome predictions, and we
found no factors predictive of physician treatment
recommendations. The physician characteristic with
the largest effect on mortality estimates was surgical
specialty, with surgeons providing an estimate that
was 10 percentage points lower (more favorable) than
nonsurgeons. We did not have sufficient sample size
to investigate possible effects of various subspecialties
such as neurocritical care or vascular neurosurgery.
Physician experience with ICH and geographic region
were also associated with physician outcome predic-
tions, though the effect sizes were relatively small (less
than 5–6 percentage points for mortality estimates),
and it is uncertain if these findings truly represent
clinically meaningful differences. The majority of
the variability in mortality estimates remained unex-
plained (model R2 of 0.32) despite inclusion of phy-
sician demographics, practice characteristics, and
personality traits. The lack of physician factors asso-
ciated with responses suggests that targeting specific
physician groups for additional training in neurologic
prognostication is unlikely to be beneficial.
Physicians recommended a lower intensity of treat-
ment (1, 2, or 3 on the 6-point ordinal scale) in
approximately 1/3 of cases, despite national guidelines
recommending against early treatment limitations in
ICH.23 This may be reflective of a general pattern of
clinical nihilism that has been described in ICH.2,5 An
American Heart Association Scientific Statement has
suggested that physicians should be aware of their own
potential biases when making recommendations and
attempt to limit the effect of these biases on treatment
recommendations.9 Physicians may also make recom-
mendations to limit life-sustaining treatment in an
attempt to spare the patient from survival with disabil-
ity24,25 and limit the surrogate’s burden26 of making
such a difficult decision. This approach, however,
may be problematic in situations where the prognosis
is uncertain, or if the surrogate has not explicitly stated
a desire to cede decision-making authority to the phy-
sician.25 A study from a general ICU population
showed that the majority of surrogates preferred to
maintain the final decision-making authority for life-
sustaining treatment,27 suggesting that this paternalis-
tic approach without first attempting to determine
how involved the surrogate wants to be in decisions
may be inappropriate.25
We did not identify any consistent effect of
patient race on physician treatment recommenda-
tions, which may seem in contrast to prior work
suggesting racial and ethnic differences in use of
life-sustaining treatments after ICH.7,28 However, it

 is worth noting that in the current study, the patient’s
stated treatment preferences were held constant across
race (see appendix e-1 for details of preference state-
ment). Since the effect of race-ethnicity on life-
sustaining treatments is likely explained in part by
differences in patient or family preferences, it is not
necessarily surprising that there were no racial differ-
ences observed in treatment recommendations. Alter-
natively, describing race in a text scenario (rather than
with pictures or videos) may not have been a strong
enough trigger for physicians to consider the effect of
race on their responses.
This work has limitations. It is possible that the sur-
vey scenarios and responses may not reflect the com-
plexities of actual practice, and that physicians may be
able to make better prognostic estimates and treatment
recommendations when able to interact with the patient
and family. However, given the infrequent use of
advance directives and widespread misdiagnosis of
patient preferences in other conditions,9,29 it is unlikely

 that our results are explained fully by the hypothetical
nature of these scenarios. The study design does not
allow us to determine if the prognostic score caused
any individual physician to change his or her treatment
recommendations, as the score was only randomized
between
physicians,
and
there
was
no
within-
physician assessment of responses before and after view-
ing the score. Another limitation is the relatively low
response rate (22%), which is a well-known problem in
physician surveys.30 However, the age, race/ethnicity,
and proportion in academic practice is similar to that
reported in a recent American Academy of Neurology
member census.31 Eighty-nine percent of respondents
reported recent involvement in the care of ICH pa-
tients, suggesting that the results of this survey are rep-
resentative of current clinical practice.
We identified substantial variability in physician
prognosis and treatment recommendations for ICH.
Few physician factors were identified that predicted
responses and much of the variability in responses re-
mained unexplained. Increasing use of an accurate for-
mal prognostic score may be one way to standardize
physician prognostic estimates. Given the potential
for a prognostic score to either increase or decrease
the recommended intensity of treatment, careful study
of the effect of these scores and how best to implement
their use in clinical settings is warranted.

Figure 3
Effect of providing a model prognostic estimate on physician treatment recommendations
Physicians indicated their recommended initial intensity of treatment on a 6-point ordinal scale with anchors of 1 5 comfort
measures and 6 5 full intensive treatment. Numbers inside each bar represent the percentage of cases where each level of
treatment intensity was selected. In each panel (A–D), the top bar represents the responses where no prognostic score was
provided, and the bottom bar is the responses when physicians were provided a prognostic score that gave the probability
of functional independence at 90 days (with options of 0%, 13%, or 66%, depending on the case characteristics). Note that
the largest differences in recommendations are observed in panels A and D. GCS 5 Glasgow Coma Scale.
