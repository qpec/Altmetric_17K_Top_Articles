Abstract: In addition to central hyperexcitability and impaired top–down modulation, chronic 
inflammation probably plays a role in the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia (FM). Indeed, on the 
basis of both animal experiments and human studies involving the analysis of cytokines and 
other inflammation-related proteins in different body fluids, neuroinflammatory mechanisms 
are considered to be central to the pathophysiology of many chronic pain conditions. However, 
concerning FM, previous human plasma/serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytokine studies 
have looked only at a few predetermined cytokine candidates. Instead of analyzing only a few 
substances at a time, we used a new multiplex protein panel enabling simultaneous analysis of 
92 inflammation-related proteins. Hence, we investigated the CSF and plasma inflammatory 
profiles of 40 FM patients compared with CSF from healthy controls (n=10) and plasma from 
blood donor controls (n=46). Using multivariate data analysis by projection, we found evidence 
of both neuroinflammation (as assessed in CSF) and chronic systemic inflammation (as assessed 
in plasma). Two groups of proteins (one for CSF and one for plasma) highly discriminating 
between patients and controls are presented. Notably, we found high levels of CSF chemokine 
CX3CL1 (also known as fractalkine). In addition, previous findings concerning IL-8 in FM were 
replicated, in both CSF and plasma. This is the first time that such an extensive inflammatory 
profile has been described for FM patients. Hence, FM seems to be characterized by objective 
biochemical alterations, and the lingering characterization of its mechanisms as essentially 
idiopathic or even psychogenic should be seen as definitively outdated.
Keywords: cerebrospinal fluid, chemokines, chronic pain, cytokines, fibromyalgia, inflammation
Introduction
Fibromyalgia (FM) is a musculoskeletal pain condition characterized by chronic wide-
spread pain and increased pain sensitivity, and it is often accompanied by sleep distur-
bances, fatigue, memory problems and psychological comorbidities.1 The prevalence 
of FM is ~2% worldwide,2 and it is more common in women.1 Although pregabalin, 
duloxetine and milnacipran have been approved by the US Food and Drug Adminis-
tration (FDA) for use in FM, they provide only partial symptom relief in a minority 
of patients and have not been approved for this indication by the European Medicines 
Agency (EMA).3–6 Off-label use of amitriptyline is considered appropriate,3 but most 
patients on such medication discontinue therapy because of either lack of efficacy or 
tolerability problems. Drug therapy is not mandatory for the treatment of FM,2 and 
FM patients are often viewed from a rehabilitative perspective, multidisciplinary pain

programs being the state of the art for the management of 
complex, chronic, nonmalignant pain.7 However, better and 
safer pharmacological treatment options would of course be 
a major step forward.
There is a need to better understand the pathophysiologi-
cal mechanisms of FM, and such knowledge would perhaps 
enable the development of better therapeutic drugs. Central 
sensitization, defined as nociception-driven amplification of 
neural signaling within the central nervous system (CNS) 
leading to pain hypersensitivity,8 is considered to be an 
important pathophysiological mechanism in chronic pain 
conditions, not least in FM.9–11 The top–down modulating 
systems are impaired in FM,12 and this probably contributes 
to central hyperexcitability. Hence, it seems probable that 
central processes and peripheral nociceptive input interact. 
Indeed, ongoing peripheral input seems important if central 
hyperexcitability is to be maintained.13
Cytokines are small molecules that are released from 
immunocompetent cells, and cytokines are classified as either 
pro- or anti-inflammatory.14,15 Plasma and/or serum levels 
of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 are elevated 
in patients with FM,16,17 as were cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
levels of IL-8 in one study.18 Indeed, the CSF is a relevant 
body fluid to investigate in pain conditions, as it is in direct 
contact with the CNS and can be hypothesized to mirror 
CNS pathology. CSF levels of classical neuropeptides such 
as substance P
, beta-endorphin and other endogenous opioids 
have therefore been studied in many different pain states.19–24 
Neuroinflammatory mechanisms are nowadays considered a 
very important part of the pathophysiology of chronic pain.25,26
The aim of the present study was to investigate the CSF 
and plasma inflammatory profiles of FM patients compared 
with healthy controls. Instead of analyzing only a few sub-
stances at a time, we used a multiplex protein panel enabling 
simultaneous analysis of 92 inflammatory biomarkers. This 
broader approach increases the chance of both validating 
previous findings and discovering novel important biomark-
ers not previously considered in FM. Moreover, in order to 
analyze data from a systems biology perspective,27 ie, looking 
at all variables simultaneously and not just one by one, mul-
tivariate data analysis (MVDA) by projection was used.28–30
Methods
Subjects and sampling procedures of CSF 
and blood
Patients
Patients were recruited through study information distributed 
to members by the Norwegian Fibromyalgia Association, and 
females 20–60 years of age suffering from FM according to 
the 1990 criteria of the American College of Rheumatology 
(ACR) were included. The diagnosis was established or veri-
fied by a consultant in rheumatology. Patients were excluded 
from participation if any verified organic cause of the pain 
condition was found or if there was an organic condition 
probably influencing the symptoms of FM. Moreover, any 
history of any serious medical illness or current or previous 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 
Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) diagnosis of mood disorders (last 
12 months), anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, demen-
tia, epilepsy, seizure disorders, alcohol or drug abuse led to 
exclusion. All patients underwent a structured psychiatric 
interview for DSM-IV and Montgomery–Åsberg Depression 
Rating Scale.
Lumbar puncture was performed fasting between eight 
and nine in the morning. A total of 10 mL of CSF was 
obtained as 10 separate aliquots and immediately put on 
dry ice for cooling and freezing and afterwards stored in an 
ultra freezer until analysis. None of the patients received any 
psychotropic medication at the time of the lumbar puncture.
csF from healthy controls
Healthy controls were recruited by local advertisement at 
Linköping University and by contacting them from earlier 
studies. Informed consent was obtained. We have elsewhere 
published a detailed description of how the absence of any 
significant disease (including chronic pain) was ensured, 
and this will not be repeated here.29 Intrathecal access was 
obtained by lumbar puncture, and a 10 mL sample of CSF 
was taken. The sample was immediately cooled on ice and 
transported to the Painomics® Laboratory, Linköping Univer-
sity Hospital, where it was checked for blood contamination, 
centrifuged and divided into aliquots and stored at -70°C 
until analysis.
control plasma samples from blood donors
In addition to analyzing CSF from patients and healthy con-
trols, we also compared the plasma inflammatory profile of 
the same cohort of FM patients with healthy blood donors 
as controls. For the FM patients, the blood samples were 
obtained at the same occasion as the lumbar puncture and 
immediately centrifuged before storage in an ultra freezer.
analytical method
In the present study, we applied the multiplex proximity 
extension assay (PEA) in which 92 proteins (Table S1) 
were simultaneously analyzed.31,32 The multiplex proximity

Fibromyalgia and inflammation
extension assay (PEA) was performed using Proseek® Mul-
tiplex Inflammation I (Olink Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden) 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 1 mL 
sample was mixed with 3 mL incubation mix. The incuba-
tion mix contained 94 probe pairs (each pair comprising 
two target-specific antibodies with unique barcoded DNA 
oligonucleotides attached). The mixture was incubated at 
8°C overnight. Then, 96 mL extension mix including PEA 
enzyme and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reagents was 
added and incubated for 5 min at room temperature, after 
which the plate was transferred to a thermal cycler for an 
extension reaction followed by 17 cycles of DNA amplifi-
cation. A 96.96 Dynamic Array IFC (Fluidigm, South San 
Francisco, CA, USA) was prepared and primed according 
to the manufacturer’s instructions. After that, in a new plate, 
2.8 mL of sample mixture was mixed with 7.2 mL of detection 
mix from which 5 mL was loaded into the right side of the 
primed 96.96 Dynamic Array IFC. In all, 5 mL of the primer 
pairs, unique for each assay, were loaded into the left side of 
the 96.96 Dynamic Array IFC, and the protein expression 
program was run in Fluidigm Biomark Reader according to 
the instructions for Proseek® Multiplex. Data were expressed 
as normalized protein expression (NPX). NPX values were 
acquired by normalizing cq-values against extension control 
as well as interplate control and a correction factor. NPX 
values were on log2 scale. A high NPX value corresponds to 
a high protein concentration and can be linearized by using 
the formula 2NPX. NPX can be used for statistical multivariate 
analysis and express relative quantification between samples 
but is not an absolute quantification.
statistics
This study generated data on 92 potentially interacting 
proteins. Traditional univariate statistical analysis can 
quantify level changes of individual proteins but disregard 
interrelationships between them and thereby ignore system-
wide aspects. Therefore, we used SIMCA-P+ version 13.0 
(Umetrics AB, Umeå, Sweden) for MVDA computations, 
looking at all the variables simultaneously and thereby taking 
the overall correlation structure of the material into consider-
ation.30 The MVDA workflow and reported parameters were 
in accordance with Wheelock and Wheelock,28 and we have 
elsewhere extensively described the detailed rationale for 
using MVDA as opposed to classical regression in an open 
access paper.29 Briefly, we first used principal component 
analysis (PCA) for data overview and detection of outliers. 
Then, orthogonal partial least squares – discriminant analysis 
(OPLS-DA) was used to regress (predict) group membership, 
ie, the purpose was to find which proteins were responsible 
for group discrimination (patient or healthy control).
Data were log transformed when needed (using the 
appropriate in-built SIMCA-P+ function) and scaled to 
unit variance. The R2 value indicates how well the model 
explains the dataset, whereas cross-validated Q2 indicates 
the predictive power. Analysis of variance of cross-validated 
predictive residuals (CV-ANOVA) measures the significance 
of the observed group separation in OPLS-DA and provides 
a familiar p-value. Group separation can be visualized in a 
score plot, using the latent variables of the model as axes; 
hence, the score plot illustrates how the study subjects relate 
to each other. The importance of the variables for the OPLS-
DA model could be quantified as a variable influence on 
projection (VIP) value. VIP indicates the relevance of each 
X-variable pooled over all dimensions and Y-variables – ie, 
VIP values indicate the group of variables that best explain Y. 
Variables with a VIP >1.0 and having a 95% confidence inter-
val not including zero are usually considered significant.28,30,33
For traditional univariate statistics, which were used 
only for MVDA-selected variables (with one exception, 
refer the “Discussion” section), all computations were made 
using IBM® SPSS® Statistics version 23, and the results in 
the text and tables are generally given as median values 
(range) or proportions. Mann–Whitney U test was used to 
compare groups, and p<0.05 (two-sided test) was considered 
significant.
ethics
Concerning the FM patients, the study protocol was approved 
by the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics, 
South-East Health Region, Norway, and the patients received 
both written and oral information about the study and gave 
their written consent. Protocol for the healthy controls was 
approved by the Regional Ethics Committee in Linköping, 
Sweden (Dnr M136-06 and Dnr 2012/94-32). The use of 
blood donor samples was approved by the local ethical board 
at Uppsala University (01-167) with the limitation that only 
information about age and sex was to be stored. The study 
was performed in full accordance with the Declaration of 
Helsinki (1965 and later revisions).

(24–60 years) vs. 54 years (44–57 years), respectively, 
p=0.092. We excluded proteins with >20% below-limit of 
detection (LoD) values in both patients and healthy controls 
(ie, >20% in patients and >20% in controls).32 Hence, the 
CSF results of the present study are based on 53 proteins.
The CSF protein data of the 51 subjects were overviewed 
by PCA to check for multivariate outliers. The model had 
three principal components, R2=0.61 and Q2=0.48. One 
strong outlier was detected by Hotelling’s T2 (T2Crit 99%), 
and this subject was excluded from further analyses. Distance 
to model in the X-space showed four nonserious moderate 
outliers, and hence (because nonserious), these subjects were 
not excluded from the analysis. As a consequence, 40 patients 
and 10 controls were kept for OPLS-DA analysis.
Regression of class-discriminating CSF proteins
In order to identify important class-discriminating pro-
teins, an OPLS-DA model was computed. The model had 
two latent variables (one predictive interclass and one 
orthogonal intraclass), R2=0.80 and Q2=0.75. The model 
was highly significant by CV-ANOVA (p<0.001), and hence, 
clear group separation was achieved (Figure 1). In all, 11 
substances had VIP >1.3, implying high significance for 
group separation, and these 11 substances were therefore 
scrutinized using traditional statistics (Table 1 and Figure 
2). To investigate any putative effect of sex, a new OPLS-
DA model was computed with the four men excluded, ie, 
the model compared 40 patients and seven healthy controls. 
The list of the 11 most discriminating proteins was exactly 
the same as in Table 1, although the order varied somewhat 
(data not shown).
Plasma analyses
Overview of plasma cohorts
Plasma data were available for 35 FM patients who were all 
females, whereas 32 out of 47 blood donor controls were 
females (68%). The age of the patients did not significantly 
differ from blood donor controls: 47 years (24–60 years) vs. 
48 years (27–67 years), respectively, p=0.599. We excluded 
proteins with >20% below-LoD values in both patients and 
blood donors (ie, >20% in patients and >20% in controls).32 
Hence, the plasma results of the present study are based on 
75 proteins.

Fibromyalgia and inflammation
The plasma protein data of the 82 subjects were over-
viewed by PCA to check for multivariate outliers. The model 
had three PCs, R2=0.50 and Q2=0.34. One strong outlier (a 
blood donor) was detected by Hotelling’
s T2 (T2Crit 99%), and 
this subject was excluded from further analyses. Distance to 
model in the X-space showed six nonserious moderate outli-
ers, and hence (because nonserious), these subjects were not 
excluded from analysis. As a consequence, 35 patients and 
46 controls were kept for OPLS-DA analysis.
Regression of class-discriminating plasma proteins
In order to identify important class-discriminating proteins, 
an OPLS-DA model was computed. The model had three 
latent variables (one predictive interclass and two orthogo-
nal intraclass), R2=0.97 and Q2=0.92. The model was highly 
significant by CV-ANOVA (p<0.001), and hence, clear 
group separation was achieved. In all, 21 substances had VIP 
>1.3, implying very high significance for group separation, 
and these 21 substances were therefore scrutinized using

traditional statistics (Table 2). To investigate a putative effect 
of sex, a new OPLS-DA model was computed with men 
excluded, ie, the model compared 35 patients and 32 healthy 
controls. The list of the 21 most discriminating proteins was 
exactly the same as in Table 2, although the order varied 
somewhat (data not shown).
Of the 11 proteins listed in Table 1, four are also pres-
ent in Table 2 and were therefore important for group dis-
crimination in both plasma and CSF; these four proteins 
were CXCL6, LAPTGF-beta-1, CXCL5, and MCP-2. The 
remaining seven proteins of Table 1 had very low VIPs in the 
plasma model, VIPs ranging from 0.11 to 0.82. Hence, these 
seven proteins were very important for group discrimina-
tion in CSF but not in plasma. Finally, the top five proteins 
of Table 2 were not present in Table 1, indicating that these 
five proteins (STAMBP
, SIRT2, CD40, AXIN1, and IL-7) 
strongly discriminate patients from controls in plasma but 
not in CSF (Figure 3).
summary of main results
Instead of looking at a limited number of predetermined 
proteins, we have analyzed 92 inflammation-related  
proteins 
in CSF and plasma from patients with FM, compared to 
controls. Group separation was achieved for both body 
fluids using MVDA, and the proteins responsible for group 
discrimination are presented in Table 1 and Table 2. We 
found evidence of both neuroinflammation (as assessed 
in CSF) and chronic systemic inflammation (as assessed 
in plasma). For detailed descriptive statistics (10th, 25th, 
50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles) for all analyzed proteins, 
see Tables S2 and S3.
Discussion
We have determined the CSF and plasma inflammatory pro-
files of 40 FM patients compared to healthy controls (CSF) 
and blood donors (plasma).
csF vs. systemic levels
The CSF is an important potential “mirror” for pathophysi-
ological processes in the spinal cord.29,34 Neuroinflammation 
and gliosis are important concepts in modern pain medi-
cine.25,35 Are we perhaps “seeing” some aspects of central 
neuroinflammation in the protein list of Table 1? This would 
be a major step forward for pain medicine, as evidence of 
central neuroinflammation has hitherto been mostly gained 
through animal experiments.25,36
High systemic levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 
and IL-8 have been previously been found in FM.16,17 Here, 
we investigated a large number of plasma cytokines at the 
same time. Notably, there is some overlap between the list of 
discriminating plasma proteins (Table 2) and the CSF protein 
list (Table 1), reflecting that although plasma and CSF partly 
mirror different compartments, they are also interlinked. We 
have also confirmed previous findings, namely, that systemic 
IL-8 levels are elevated in these patients (Table 2). Although 
IL-6 does not appear in Table 2, ie, IL-6 is not one of the 
major group discriminating proteins when taking the whole 
correlation structure of the material into consideration, when 
looking at IL-6 with classical univariate statistics, we still 
found a significant difference between groups, IL-6 being 
elevated in FM patients (p<0.001).
neuroimmunity and chronic pain
A large proportion of the chemokines listed in Table 1 belong 
to the CC or the CXL subfamilies of chemokines.37 Chemo-
kines are expressed by neurons, glia and neural progenitor 
cells, and the synthesis is increased in response to injury. 
These chemokines initiate cytokine activations, leading to 
neuroinflammation.38 Hence, our results are in line with 
several lines of evidence concerning the role of neuroimmu-
nity in chronic pain.25,26,39 For instance, in animal models of

Fibromyalgia and inflammation
pathological pain conditions, neuron-to-glia communication 
in the spinal cord has been shown to be mediated by, among 
other substances, the chemokine CX3CL1 (also known as 
fractalkine) released from damaged or activated first-order 
neurons.25 Indeed, CX3CL1/fractalkine has been proposed 
as one of the most prominent signaling pathways in preclini-
cal models of neuropathic pain.40–42 Hence, the presence of 
CX3CL1/fractalkine among our principal findings is notable 
(Table 1 and Figure 2F). Together with its signaling pair 
cathepsin S, fractalkine is a novel therapeutic approach for 
the treatment of chronic pain,43 for instance by cathepsin S 
inhibition.44 Among the substances listed in Table 1, we also 
want to highlight IL-18. Animal models (albeit for neuro-
pathic pain) suggest that IL-18 is an important mediator for 
the development of pathological pain.45,46
The process of gliosis is characterized by activated 
microglia releasing key multifunctional cytokines (TNF-α, 
IL-1β, IL-6) that orchestrate the subsequent production of 
downstream algesic mediators.36,47,48 In this context, it is also 
important to report negative results. Notably, in the present 
study, IL-6, MCP-1 (also known as CCL-2), and beta-NGF 
were not important for class discrimination in CSF. It is

Bäckryd et al
possible that these “classical” mediators are animal model 
specific (translation is a well-known problem49) or that they 
are specific for neuropathic pain as opposed to FM.35 Also, 
it is important to acknowledge that almost all values of TNF-
α, BDNF and GDNF were under the LoD, and these three 
proteins were hence not part of the OPLS-DA model. Given 
previous findings,18,50 it is also notable that IL-8 is not listed 
in our top 11 list in Table 1. However, a retrospective look at 
this particular cytokine showed a VIP=1.17, ie, higher than 
the usual cut-off value for “significant” VIP
, indicating that 
IL-8 does contribute to the model, albeit not very strongly. 
Moreover, the levels of IL-8 were significantly higher in 
patients by univariate statistics (p=0.001). Hence, the pres-
ent study confirmed that CSF IL-8 levels are high in FM.18
It is interesting to compare the present findings in Table 
2 to the findings of Moen et al,32 who recently used the same 
multiplex panel in patients with chronic lumbar radicular 
pain. In all, 16 out of the 21 proteins (76%) listed in Table 
2 are described by Moen et al as being significantly upregu-
lated in patients with a high-level pain. This high degree of 
overlap may perhaps point to a common inflammatory pattern 
in chronic pain, regardless of which chronic pain condition 
is studied. However, despite a significant overlap, different 
chronic pain conditions may exhibit partly different systemic 
inflammatory profiles. In the present study, considering Table 
2, the following five proteins were not described by Moen et 
al: IL-7, CD244, ADA, MMP-1, and EN-RAGE.
Although many FM patients use nonsteroidal anti-inflam-
matory drugs (NSAIDs),2 the current scientific evidence is 
usually not considered strong enough to warrant a general 
recommendation for the use of NSAIDs.3 Hence, although 
the results of the present study point to the importance of 
chronic inflammation in FM, it is important not to jump 
to conclusions concerning the use of NSAIDs in this pain 
condition. FM being a chronic condition, it is important to 
ponder the potential side effects of long-term NSAID use.51 
Most FM patients being women, the possible relationship 
between inflammation and levels of ovarian hormones in FM 
patients is also a possible area for future investigations.52–54
study limitations
There are a number of limitations to the present study. First, 
although the CSF control group was reasonably well matched 
by age, it was much smaller than the patient group. Second, 
as the plasma control group consisted of blood donors, lim-
ited information was available about them, although blood 
donors can be expected to be fairly healthy. Indeed, blood 
donors are often used to determine reference values for new 
biomarkers. To summarize these two points about the control 
groups used in this study, the plasma control group was more 
adequate size-wise than the CSF control group, but on the 
other hand, it was less well characterized. Ideally, of course, it 
would have been best to have the same control group for both 
body fluids, but this was not possible for practical reasons.
Third, the FM patients were all females, whereas the two 
control groups were mixed. Although neither our CSF nor 
our plasma main results seemed to be influenced by sex, our 
findings should therefore not unreflectively be generalized 
to men. Fourth, body mass index (BMI), which was not reg-
istered in this study, can influence the inflammatory profile. 
Notably, for the interpretation of the results of the present 
study, it must be acknowledged that this has been shown for 
CXCL10, CXCL6, CX3CL1 and CCL19; however, Spear-
man’s rho did not range higher than 0.20–0.26 for these 
substances.55 In another study, it was shown that 15 out of 
63 cytokines in plasma were associated with age;56 hence, 
having age-matched controls is probably important.
Fifth, the most important limitation of the present study 
is perhaps that the controls came from other centers than 
the patients. Hence, the question arises if our results can be 
explained by different pre-analysis handlings of CSF and/or 
plasma samples. However, using the same multiplex inflam-
matory panel in patients with high and low levels of pain, 
Moen et al32 found a clear inflammatory pattern in patients 
with high levels of chronic radicular pain. Therefore, even 
though the handling of samples by different centers remains 
a major limitation of the present study (making the results 
somewhat uncertain), the results of Moen et al show that it 
is possible to find clear inflammatory differences between 
groups of chronic pain patients even when the controls are 
recruited from the same center. Hence, dismissing our results 
outright as an error of measurement due to different sample 
handling does not seem to be well founded, although it of 
course remains a possibility. The findings in the present study 
need to be confirmed in other cohorts where patient and 
control samples were handled by the same study personnel 
prior to analysis.
Question of causality
Granted that our results are valid, is the present inflamma-
tory fingerprint directly related to the pathophysiology of 
FM (eg, central sensitization due to neuroinflammation?) or 
is it an inflammatory risk factor that was present prior to the 
development of chronic pain (eg, a genetic  
susceptibility57)? 
A third possibility could be that the fingerprint is a con-
sequence of the chronic pain condition, eg, mirroring

Fibromyalgia and inflammation
pain-related stress, inactivity,58 depression59 or bad sleep.60 
Whether our findings are a risk factor for, a direct mirror 
of or a consequence of the pathophysiological processes 
involved in these patients is hence an important area for 
further investigations. Of course, all three of these catego-
ries may play a role. One could for instance hypothesize 
that some individuals are more inflammation prone at the 
outset (a risk factor) and that they therefore develop a strong 
neuroimmune and/or systemic reaction leading both to the 
experience of pain and to other symptoms of the “sickness 
syndrome”.14 All of this is of course highly speculative but 
makes good physiological sense. Disentangling the contri-
bution of these potentially mutually interacting factors will 
be very difficult. For instance, levels of peripheral IL-6 are 
known to be influenced by regular exercise, individuals who 
are inactive having higher baseline levels of this particular 
cytokine.58
statistical considerations
When analyzing many variables, the so-called multiple 
testing problem is an ever-present concern.61 Theoretically, 
using a traditional significance level of 0.05, if “k” is the 
number of comparisons, the risk of a least one false positive 
is 1-0.95k.30 In this study, the risk of at least one false-positive 
CSF finding would hence be 93% (see the Results section), 
and for our plasma results (given the higher number of 
variables), it would be even higher. However, the formula 
assumes that the variables are independent of each other, 
and when looking at cytokines and chemokines, this assump-
tion is not well founded. Moreover, MVDA looks at all the 
variables together at the same time, taking the correlation 
structure of the dataset into consideration, thereby favoring 
structure and information over “noise”.30 Hence, although the 
multiple testing issue should not be dismissed too lightly, it 
should not on the other hand be exaggerated. There may of 
course be some false positives among our findings, but all 
in all it does not seem sensible to dismiss all our results as a 
gigantic type I error. The MVDA methodology used in the 
present study is the same as used by the Linköping group in 
a number of recent peer-reviewed publications in different 
journals,22,29,62–66 and it is congruent with the principles argued 
for by Wheelock and Wheelock.28 Finally, in order to ensure 
the robustness of our statistical methodology, the CSF data 
of the present study were recomputed using the statistical 
methodology described by Moen et al32 (with use of false 
discovery rate); the result of this recomputation was exactly 
the same as the list presented in Table 1 (TG being the last 
author of both articles).
Conclusion
Instead of looking at a limited number of predetermined 
cytokines, we have used an inflammatory panel on patients 
with FM, analyzing both CSF and plasma. Group separation 
was achieved for both body fluids, and the present study is the 
most extensive, “holistic” inflammatory profiling study of FM 
patients to date. We found evidence of both neuroinflamma-
tion (as assessed in CSF) and chronic systemic inflammation 
(as assessed in plasma).
