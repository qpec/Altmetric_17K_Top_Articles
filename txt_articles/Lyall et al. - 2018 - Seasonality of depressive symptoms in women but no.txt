Running title: Seasonality of depressive symptoms 
 2 
 
Abstract 
 
Background: We examined whether seasonal variations in depressive symptoms occurred 
independently of demographic and lifestyle factors, and were related to change in day length and/or 
outdoor temperature.  
 
Methods: In a cross-sectional analysis of >150,000 participants of the UK Biobank cohort, we used the 
cosinor method to assess evidence of seasonality of a total depressive symptoms score and of low 
mood, anhedonia, tenseness and tiredness scores in women and men. Associations of depressive 
symptoms with day length and mean outdoor temperature were then examined.  
 
Results: Seasonality of total depressive symptom scores, anhedonia and tiredness scores was 
observed in women but not men, with peaks in winter. In women, increased day length was associated 
with reduced low mood and anhedonia scores, independent of demographic and lifestyle factors. For 
women, longer day length was associated with increased tiredness. Associations with day length were 
not independent of the average outdoor temperature preceding assessment. 
 
Limitations: This was a cross-sectional investigation – longitudinal studies of within-subject seasonal 
variation in mood are necessary. Outcome measures relied on self-report and measured only a subset 
of depressive symptoms. 
 
Conclusion: This large, population-based study provides evidence of seasonal variation in depressive 
symptoms in women. Shorter days were associated with increased feelings of low mood and 
anhedonia in women. Clinicians should be aware of these population-level sex differences in seasonal 
 3 
 
mood variations in order to aid recognition and treatment of depression and subclinical depressive 
symptoms.

Introduction 
 
Seasonal differences in mood and depressive symptoms have often been reported in both the general 
population and in individuals with mood disorders. At the subclinical level, evidence of greater 
depressive symptoms, including depressed mood and fatigue, has been reported in winter compared 
to summer months at temperate latitudes such as Northern Europe, North America and East Asia 
(Baek et al., 2016; Basnet et al., 2016; Friborg et al., 2012; Kerr et al., 2013; Mersch et al., 2004).  
A seasonal subtype of major depressive disorder (previously referred to as Seasonal Affective Disorder) 
may affect up to 3% of the population, and is characterised by reliable onset of depressive episodes 
in a particular season, usually winter (Levitt et al., 2000; Pjrek et al., 2016). Even among depressed 
patients not diagnosed with a seasonal subtype, peaks in depressive symptoms and new episodes are 
more common during winter (Cobb et al., 2014; Patten et al., 2017). New prescriptions of 
antidepressants also peak in the winter months (Gardarsdottir et al., 2010). 
It has been suggested that seasonal variation in mood may be driven by changes in photoperiod (day 
length) (Walton et al., 2011). Reduced day length and later sunrise in winter is thought to lead to a 
phase shift in sleep-wake circadian rhythms, associated with disruptions in mood, as well as sleep, 
immune function, metabolic function, cognition and many other health outcomes (Friborg et al., 2012; 
Hopstock et al., 2013; LeGates et al., 2014; Meyer et al., 2016). Consistent with a photoperiod 
hypothesis, light therapy has been shown to be effective in reducing depressive symptoms (Penders 
et al., 2016).  
Despite this assumption of the importance of day length in influencing circadian rhythm-based 
physiology and psychology, most studies to date have not accounted for the contribution of day 
length, nor for seasonal variations in other environmental factors such as temperature (O’Hare et al., 
2016), and the reliability of conclusions concerning seasonality of mood has often been questioned 
(Murray, 2017). A number of studies have found no or very weak evidence for seasonal fluctuations 
 5 
 
in mood or rates of depression (Traffanstedt et al., 2016; Winthorst et al., 2014), and, of studies that 
do report seasonal variation, many employ subjective and poorly validated measures such as the 
Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire (Magnusson, 1996). In patients diagnosed with a seasonal 
form of major depressive disorder, only a small minority reliably and persistently show a seasonal 
pattern (Cobb et al., 2014). The majority of studies simply report cross-sectional differences in 
outcomes between summer and winter months, or quadratic curves across months (Patten et al., 
2017). These fall short of providing evidence of true seasonality as they do not demonstrate the 
periodicity which is expected if mood symptoms vary in line with regular annual patterns.  
These issues can be largely overcome by use of a multivariable cosinor method (Barnett and Dobson, 
2010; Cornelissen, 2014). Cosinor-based rhythmometry is able to detect and demonstrate periodicity 
across time periods, yielding parameter estimates for the amplitude and phase of seasonal variation 
and giving more robust support for seasonal variation than simple differences between months. 
Although this method is commonly used with time series data, it can also be applied to cross-sectional 
survey data (Barnett and Dobson, 2010; Down et al., 2011). Inclusion of lifestyle and environmental 
variables including day length in multivariable models can also demonstrate whether seasonal change 
in depressive symptoms tracks change in day length and/or temperature, independently of 
confounders.  
This is an important issue for affective disorders research because evidence of a clear seasonal pattern 
of depressive symptoms at the population level should be conveyed to clinicians to aid the detection 
and appropriate treatment of these symptoms (O’Hare et al., 2016). Such evidence may also indicate 
the utility of screening patients for seasonal patterns in temperate countries (Murray, 2003). In this 
study, within a very large population cohort, we aimed to assess whether self-reported depressive 
symptoms show evidence of seasonality and association with environmental variables including day 
length and temperature, and whether these associations are independent of demographic and 
lifestyle factors.

Methods 
 
Participants and ethical approval 
From 2006-2010, 502,655 participants aged 37-73 years were recruited to the UK Biobank cohort. 
Participants attended one of 22 assessment centres across the UK and completed a range of lifestyle, 
demographic, health and mood questionnaires, cognitive assessments and physical measures (Sudlow 
et al., 2015). The 478,522 participants who completed a touchscreen questionnaire on their mood 
during the two weeks prior to assessment and who provided data on sociodemographic characteristics 
were included in this cross-sectional study. Sample sizes for specific analyses differed according to the 
number of participants with available data for all sociodemographic, lifestyle and environmental 
variables (sample sizes are reported in results tables, below). As the time of day of commencing the 
touchscreen assessment was available for only ~170,000 participants, sample sizes were reduced in 
analyses including this covariate compared to analyses not including this covariate. UK Biobank 
received ethical approval from the North West Multi-centre Research Ethics Committee 
(11/NW/03820). The current analyses were conducted under UK Biobank application number 26209 
(PI Wyse).  
 
Mood, health and lifestyle variables 
The principal outcome measure consisted of scores reflecting the frequency of depressive symptoms 
over the two weeks prior to the assessment. During a computerised touchscreen assessment, 
participants were asked to indicate how often over the previous two weeks they had experienced a) 
low mood (“Over the past two weeks, how often have you felt down, depressed or hopeless?”); b) 
anhedonia (“Over the past two weeks, how often have you had little interest or pleasure in doing 
 7 
 
things?”); c) tenseness (“Over the past two weeks, how often have you felt tense, fidgety or restless?”) 
and d) tiredness (Over the past two weeks, how often have you felt tired or had little energy?”). 
Participants responded “not at all”, “several days”, “more than half the days”, or “nearly every day” 
to these items. For the current analyses, these responses were coded from 0-3, respectively (that is, 
0 = “not at all” and 3 = “nearly every day”). Items a), b) and d) are derived directly from the Patient 
Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), a depression screening instrument (Spitzer et al., 2000), and item c) 
is a modified version of a further PHQ-9 item (“Over the last two weeks, how often have you been 
bothered by moving or speaking so slowly that other people could have noticed? Or the opposite – 
being so fidgety or restless that you have been moving around a lot more than usual?”). For 
participants who responded to all four questions, a total depressive symptom score from 0-12 was 
calculated from the sum of the scores on each question. In secondary analyses, scores on each 
individual question were examined as separate outcomes. 
Townsend deprivation scores (Townsend, 1987) were derived based on postcode of residence, with 
negative scores reflecting relatively greater affluence and positive scores reflecting greater 
deprivation. Smoking status (never smoked, previous smoker, current smoker) and frequency of 
alcohol intake (never; special occasions only; 1-3 times a month; 1-2 times a week; 3-4 times a week; 
daily/almost daily) were derived from the touchscreen lifestyle questionnaire. For both smoking and 
alcohol variables, ‘never’ was used as the reference category. Participants were asked to report their 
level and duration of physical activity in a typical day/week by answering physical activity questions 
derived from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (Craig et al., 2003). An estimate of 
metabolic equivalent hours/week (MET.hours/week) of physical activity was derived by applying 
weights of 2.5, 4 and 8 to self-reported duration of light, moderate and vigorous physical activity, 
respectively, and then summing these measures. Time of day refers to the time at which participants 
commenced the touchscreen assessment: start times before 12pm were coded as ‘morning’, 12pm-
5pm as ‘afternoon’, and after 5pm as ‘evening’.   
 8 
 
Season of completing the touchscreen assessment was included in some analyses. Following the UK 
Meteorological 
Office 
(Met 
Office) 
definitions 
of 
meteorological 
seasons 
(http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/), assessments taking place in March, April or May were coded as 
‘spring’, June-August as ‘summer’, September-November as ‘autumn’ and December-February as 
‘winter’.  
 
Environmental variables 
Day length in hours of daylight on the day of attending the assessment centre was derived from the 
latitude and longitude of participants’ postcode of residence at 1km2 resolution using open source 
Geographic Information Systems software, QGIS (http://qgis.osgeo.org). Vectorial algorithms in R 
(Corripio, 2014) were then used to derive the duration of daylight on the day of attendance of the 
Biobank assessment centre for each participant. Mean outdoor temperature values consisted of the 
average outdoor temperature (° Celsius) for the 3 weeks preceding Biobank assessment, calculated 
from data from the UK Meteorological Office weather station nearest to the assessment centre. 
 
Statistical analysis 
Analyses were stratified by gender due to previous findings of greater prevalence and greater 
seasonality of depressive symptoms in women (Suhail and Cochrane, 1998), and due to evidence of 
interactions between sex and sine and/or cosine terms for four out of the five outcome variables 
assessed (Table S1). Sine and cosine transformations of the month of attending the Biobank 
assessment were calculated using: 
1) Cos(2π(ti-1)/12) 
2) Sin(2π(ti-1)/12) 
 9 
 
where ti is an integer from 1 to 12 representing the month of assessment. For bimodal cosinor models 
the ((ti-1)/12) term was multiplied by 2 (Barnett and Dobson, 2010). 
To investigate seasonality of depressive symptom scores, negative binomial regression models were 
employed to account for overdispersion as means for all outcome variables were lower than their 
variances, and because symptom scores consisted of discrete, non-negative count data. For all models, 
likelihood ratio tests demonstrated that the overdispersion parameter was significantly greater than 
1, indicating negative binomial regression was more appropriate than Poisson (Cameron and Trivedi, 
1986). The base model for each outcome included a range of covariates, as described below. Based 
on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), NB2 (mean dispersion) negative binomial models were 
employed for the total depressive symptom score and low mood, anhedonia and tenseness scores, 
while for tiredness scores, NB1 (constant dispersion) models were employed (Cameron and Trivedi, 
1986). The cosinor method assumes the seasonal pattern of the outcome is sinusoidal: we assessed 
whether this assumption was valid and therefore whether significant evidence of seasonality was 
present by testing whether inclusion of sine and cosine transformations of month of assessment 
(equations 1 and 2) resulted in improved model fit compared to models not including month or a 
month transformation. Covariates included in the models with and without sine/cosine terms were 
age, ethnicity (white or non-white), Townsend deprivation score, UK Biobank centre, time of day 
(morning, afternoon or evening) and day of the week (weekend or weekday) the touchscreen 
assessment was started, self-reported typical physical activity (MET.hours/week), smoking status, 
frequency of alcohol intake, and mean environmental temperature. These covariates were selected 
because all showed associations with outcome (depressive symptom score) variables, and all but 
smoking status and day of the week of assessment varied by month. Improved model fit, and therefore 
seasonality, was indicated by i) significance of one or both of the sine and cosine (cosinor) terms (p < 
0.05) (this indicates the amplitude of the cosinor curve is significantly different from zero); ii)  lower 
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for the model including the cosinor terms; and iii) significance of 
the Wald Chi-squared test of the joint significance of the cosinor terms (Barnett and Dobson, 2010). 
 10 
 
The Wald test is equivalent to the Likelihood Ratio Test but can be used with robust standard errors 
(Armstrong and Sloan, 1989). In resulting cosinor models for which the above criteria were met, 
amplitude (A) was calculated by: 
 
A = √𝛽2 + 𝛾2 
 
where 𝛽 is the cosine negative binomial regression coefficient and 𝛾 is the sine negative binomial 
regression coefficient. Acrophase (φ; peak of cosinor model) in months was calculated from: 
 
φ = 12 ∗ tan−1(𝛾/ 𝛽)
2𝜋
+  1 
 
 
Focussing on outcome variables displaying evidence of seasonality, we then examined whether 
associations with day length existed and whether these were independent of a range of demographic 
and lifestyle variables (age, ethnicity, Townsend deprivation score, UK Biobank centre, typical physical 
activity, smoking status, alcohol intake) as well as mean outdoor temperature and time/day of 
assessment in a series of successive models. These analyses were intended to investigate whether 
seasonal patterns might be driven by seasonal changes in day length. Analyses were conducted using 
Stata 14 (StataCorp). 
 
Results 
Characteristics of participants 
 
Demographic characteristics are displayed in Table 1, both for the full sample included in any 
analyses, and for participants with data available for all outcomes and covariates (“subsample”). 
Participants in the subsample with data for all variables were numerically slightly older and more 
 11 
 
deprived and consisted of a slightly higher proportion of ethnic minorities, while their physical 
activity estimates were slightly higher than the full sample. Formal comparisons of characteristics 
between samples were not conducted due to overlapping samples, but numerical differences were 
very small in magnitude, and in general, characteristics were very similar between both samples. 
Tests of seasonality using cosinor models 
Plots of mean symptom scores and cosinor models are shown for women in Figure 1 and for men in 
Figure 2. In women, comparison of model fit with and without cosinor terms indicated seasonality of 
the total depressive symptom score, as well as the anhedonia and tiredness subscores (Table 2). 
Cosinor terms were significant for low mood scores, but did not significantly improve model fit 
(p=0.067). The acrophase for the total depressive symptom score occurred in January, while 
anhedonia and tiredness subscores peaked in February (Table 2 and Figure 1). For tiredness, despite 
significance of the cosine parameters for a unimodal model (period of 12 months), plots of mean 
tiredness scores (Figure 1) suggested the scores may be characterised by a bimodal model. This was 
confirmed by findings of improved model fit for tiredness scores in women when including bimodal 
sine and cosine terms compared to unimodal terms. Bimodal parameters were not significant for any 
other outcome measures in women or men.  
No evidence of seasonality of the total depressive symptom score, or any individual symptom score 
was observed for men (Table 2 and Figure 2).  
 
Associations with day length  
We then examined whether associations with day length were independent of a range of demographic 
and lifestyle variables and mean outdoor temperature (Table 3). For women, longer day length was 
associated with reduced reporting of low mood and anhedonia in women, independent of 
demographic and lifestyle variables (Models 1-2). These associations with day length were however 
attenuated in models further adjusting for mean outdoor temperature in the 3 weeks preceding 
assessment and for time and day of assessment (Models 3-4). Consistent with a contribution of 
 12 
 
outdoor temperature to the seasonality of feelings of anhedonia, greater outdoor temperature was 
significantly associated with reduced anhedonia independently of demographic and lifestyle variables, 
day length and time/day of assessment (Table 4).  
In women, longer day length was associated with increased recent feelings of tiredness after adjusting 
for demographic and lifestyle variables and mean temperature. The same pattern was observed in 
men, despite the lack of evidence of seasonality from cosinor models. In women and men, these 
associations did not, however, survive adjustment for time and day of assessment - as sample sizes 
were substantially reduced for Model 4 compared to Models 1-3, reduced power may have been a 
factor here. The apparent bimodal pattern of tiredness scores in women, and the variability in 
tiredness scores evident in Figure 1E are indicative of a complex relationship between reporting of 
tiredness and season and day length. Presence of a bimodal pattern of tiredness scores across months 
might suggest the influence of day length differs by season - tests of an interaction effect and analyses 
stratified by season are presented in supplementary material (Table S2). Independent of lifestyle, 
demographic, and temperature covariates, increased day length was associated with reduced 
reporting of tiredness in autumn, but with increased tiredness in winter (Table S2). These results 
should however be interpreted with caution due to the substantially reduced sample size after 
stratifying by season.  
 
Effects of self-reported diagnosis of mood disorder 
Chi square analysis found that for both women and men, the distribution of participants with self-
reported mood disorder (depression or bipolar disorder) did not differ according to season (women: 
χ2 = 5.55, p = 0.136; men: χ2 = 4.77, p = 0.190; Table S3), suggesting it is unlikely that findings were 
driven by seasonal differences in the proportion of participants with self-reported existing diagnoses 
of mood disorder who attended for assessment. Results were also compared after excluding from 
analyses any participants who self-reported diagnoses of mood disorder, as well as participants 
 13 
 
reporting anxiety, panic attacks, ‘nervous breakdown’, schizophrenia or self-harm/suicide attempt. 
Associations between low mood scores and day length were attenuated in women to non-significance, 
but all other associations were unchanged (Table S4 and Table S5). 
 
Discussion 
 
In this study we report evidence of seasonality of depressive symptoms in women but not men within 
a large sample of middle-aged adults in the UK. Among women, total depressive symptom score and 
anhedonia peaked in the winter months. Longer day length was associated with reduced reporting of 
low mood and anhedonia and with increased reporting of tiredness in women, independent of 
demographic and lifestyle confounders of age, ethnicity, deprivation, UK Biobank centre, typical 
physical activity, smoking status and alcohol intake. The association of tiredness with day length was 
also independent of mean outdoor temperature, but the remaining associations did not survive 
correction for temperature and time/day of assessment, suggesting that environmental factors other 
than day length may contribute to seasonal fluctuations in mood. Cosinor analysis did not reveal a 
seasonal pattern of depressive symptoms in men, but men showed similar associations of anhedonia 
and tiredness scores with day length to women. 
These findings of seasonality of depressive symptoms are consistent with a large body of literature 
reporting lower mood and increased occurrence of depression in winter months (Basnet et al., 2016; 
Cobb et al., 2014; Patten et al., 2017). However, our study extends previous findings by reporting 
evidence of periodicity in the seasonal pattern of depressive symptom changes using the cosinor 
method (Cornelissen, 2014), and by directly examining associations of depressive symptoms with day 
length and environmental temperature.  
Findings of seasonality of mood in women but not men are consistent with previous studies reporting 
a higher prevalence of depression with seasonal pattern among women (Kerr et al., 2013; Rosen et 
 14 
 
al., 1990) and with findings of a winter peak in hospital admissions for depression in women but not 
men (Suhail and Cochrane, 1998). Support for greater influence of season on depressive symptoms in 
women has also been reported longitudinally (Harmatz et al., 2000). However, some other studies did 
not find evidence of sex differences in seasonal depression (Patten et al., 2017; Pjrek et al., 2016).  
Although sex differences in seasonality of mood and other outcomes have been relatively under-
investigated, some evidence of increased sensitivity of brain electrophysiological responses (P300 
event-related potential) to seasonal change in women compared to men has been reported (Kosmidis 
et al., 1998). Greater endocrine (cortisol) and inflammatory stress responses in women have been 
linked to increased prevalence of depression (Bale and Epperson, 2015; Kuehner, 2003) and women 
are more susceptible to depressed mood when inflammation is induced (Moieni et al., 2015). It is 
plausible that this heightened reactivity to stress in women extends to a more generalised 
vulnerability to external environmental factors, including change in day length and/or temperature. 
Evidence of peaks in feelings of anhedonia in winter months and negative associations of anhedonia 
and low mood with day length are consistent with predictions (Friborg et al., 2012). Recent feelings of 
tiredness however were positively associated with day length across the year. Evidence of a possible 
bimodal pattern of tiredness scores across the year along with an interaction of season with day length 
indicate that the relationship between season and reporting of tiredness is not straightforward. A 
possibility is that the tiredness question posed to participants (“Over the past two weeks, how often 
have you felt tired or had little energy?”) is subject to bias where participants respond positively to 
this question based both on feelings of fatigue as a depressive symptom, but also on general non-
pathological tiredness due to external factors such as physical activity levels, work and social factors. 
Consistent with this, tiredness scores were markedly higher than the other depressive symptom scores 
in men and women. If this assumption is correct, the overall positive association between day length 
and tiredness scores across all seasons, and in winter in stratified analyses, could simply reflect  
greater feelings of tiredness due to external causes which increase alongside increasing daylight,  e.g., 
 15 
 
longer waking hours, earlier waking time, greater physical/social activity (O’Connell et al., 2014). In 
women, the total depressive symptom score and the low mood, anhedonia and tiredness scores were 
associated with day length independent of demographic and lifestyle confounders (LeGates et al., 
2014; Meyer et al., 2016). For each of these outcomes apart from tiredness, associations with day 
length did not however survive correction for mean outdoor temperature during the 3 weeks 
preceding the Biobank assessment. Temperature was a significant predictor of low mood and 
anhedonia scores in women independent of day length and the other demographic/lifestyle 
confounders. Together these findings suggest that temperature may have a greater influence on 
seasonal variation in mood than day length, although it remains possible that shared variance between 
both day length and temperature contributes to fluctuations in depressive symptoms. Consistent with 
the role of temperature, an earlier study found that colder temperatures within summer were 
associated with increased prescriptions of antidepressant medication in Sweden (Hartig and Catalano, 
2013). Of note, however, a small number of studies have reported no association between depressive 
symptoms and day length and/or temperature (Huibers et al., 2010; Kerr et al., 2013; O’Hare et al., 
2016). One possibility is that effects of environmental variables on mood may be moderated by time 
spent outdoors and, in particular, time spent in natural light (Keller et al., 2005). Previous findings of 
a protective effect against depressive symptoms of natural light exposure which coincides with the 
natural day/light cycle (Dumont and Beaulieu, 2007; Harb et al., 2014) suggest that such factors will 
be important considerations for future studies aiming to clarify the factors driving seasonal variation 
in mood.  
Previous evidence suggests that latitude may be a further important modifier of seasonal effects on 
mood. Both within and between countries, higher northern hemisphere latitude is associated with 
greater seasonal differences in health and mood (Kurata et al., 2016; Rosen et al., 1990), thought to 
be due to greater seasonal differences in day length and meteorological factors at higher latitudes. 
The location of the assessment centre was included as a covariate in the current analyses, but direct 
comparison of effects at higher and lower latitudes within the UK Biobank cohort were made difficult 
 16 
 
by the fact that the recruitment time period differed by centre, and sample sizes were substantially 
smaller at higher latitudes. Such direct comparisons would be informative in future studies.  
A limitation of the current study is its cross-sectional nature. The possibility remains that participants 
recruited to complete the UK Biobank baseline assessment during different months differed due to 
factors unrelated to seasonality. A follow-up web-based questionnaire which included depressive 
symptom questions was issued to many UK Biobank participants in 2016-2017. However, as data 
collection did not span a full year, it would not be possible to gain a clear picture of longitudinal change 
in mood using this data. Importantly, several studies employing a longitudinal approach have revealed 
findings similar to the current study, with winter peaks in depressive symptoms (McCarthy et al., 2002; 
Murray et al., 2001), and seasonal effects in depressive symptoms in women but not men (Harmatz et 
al., 2000).  
A further limitation is that depressive symptom scores were based on subjective responses to 
retrospective questions about feelings over the previous 2 weeks. Responses may therefore have been 
subject to recall bias. Questions were derived from the PHQ-9 which has shown very good validity in 
detecting depression (Martin et al., 2006). Item c) (tenseness) in the current analyses did not, 
however, ask about recent slowing of movement/speech in addition to restlessness/tenseness, unlike 
the corresponding PHQ-9 item, and so compounds the issue that only a subset of depressive 
symptoms were assessed. Furthermore, the combination of the four recent depressive symptom 
questions used by UK Biobank has not previously been validated as a screening tool. Two of the 
included items (low mood and anhedonia) are, however, thought to reflect core depressive symptoms 
and form the PHQ-2, which has also demonstrated very good sensitivity and specificity in screening 
for depression (Kroenke et al., 2003). As lifestyle measures were based on self-report, and deprivation 
was based on postcode area, these measures may be subject to bias and some residual confounding 
may be present.  
 17 
 
Measures of physical activity and alcohol intake were based on questions about the typical frequency 
of these activities, rather than recent trends, meaning that seasonal fluctuation in these lifestyle 
covariates was not fully taken into account. In addition to questions about typical levels of physical 
activity, UK Biobank participants also answered questions about the frequency of certain activities 
(e.g., “DIY”, “stair climbing”, “other exercises”) in the previous 4 weeks, but these questions did not 
include level or duration of activity and so were not sufficiently detailed to derive a metric of recent 
activity in metabolic equivalent hours. Recent alcohol intake questions referred only to the last 24 
hours. Recent work, however, has demonstrated seasonal variation of the measure of typical physical 
activity used here (Wyse et al., manuscript in preparation), suggesting these variables based on typical 
behaviours do in fact capture some seasonal fluctuation.  
In summary, we provide evidence that feelings of depressive symptoms (particularly anhedonia) are 
more common during winter months for women, consistent with previous research. Further, 
environmental factors including day length and outdoor temperature are important predictors of 
depressive symptoms, although future studies should also consider the role of time spent outdoors, 
time spent in natural light, and latitude. These findings have important implications for the provision 
of healthcare around the world. Subclinical depressive symptoms are associated with increased risk 
of developing major depression and with reduced wellbeing, but are often under-recognised and 
untreated (Horwath et al., 1994; O’Hare et al., 2016). Clinicians should be more aware of these 
differences in the experience of depressive symptoms between women and men across the seasons 
in order to facilitate their recognition and appropriate treatment (Patten et al., 2017). Use of screening 
tools for seasonal patterns of depressive symptoms may be of use in identifying patients who may 
need additional support at certain times of year (Vigod and Levitt, 2011).

Negative binomial regression coefficients, robust standard error (SE) and incidence rate ratios (IRR) for sine and cosine transformations of the month of 
assessment, for a) women and b) men. Models for which coefficients are reported are adjusted for age, ethnicity, Townsend deprivation score, location of 
Biobank centre, time of day and day of week of the touchscreen assessment, physical activity (MET.hours/week), smoking status, frequency of alcohol 
intake, mean environmental temperature in 3 weeks preceding assessment, in addition to sine and cosine transformations of month. ΔAIC and Wald test 
values refer to the differences between this model and a model excluding sine and cosine terms but including all other covariates. Seasonality of outcome 
variables is inferred from i) significance (p < 0.05; indicated in bold) of the sine and/or cosine negative binomial regression coefficients and ii) improved 
model fit following addition of cosinor (cosine and sine) terms, indicated by reduced AIC and significance of the Wald test. For the bimodal cosinor model 
for tiredness scores in women, ΔAIC and Wald test values refer to the comparison of the model including bimodal cosinor terms with the model including 
unimodal cosinor terms.  
* Alcohol intake excluded as a covariate due to collinearity. † Smoking status omitted due to collinearity.

Table 3. Associations between day length and recent depressive symptoms in a) women and b) men. 
 Negative binomial regression coefficients (b), robust standard error (SE) and incidence rate ratios (IRR) for associations between day length and depressive 
mood symptoms for a) women and b) men. Italics denote variables which did not show evidence of seasonality in Table1. Significant associations (p<0.05) 
are highlighted in bold. Sample size was largest for Model 1 and smallest for Model 4 due to inclusion of progressively more covariates for which data was 
missing for some participants. The range of n from Model 4 to Model 1 is displayed for each outcome.

Model 1 adjusted for age, ethnicity, Townsend deprivation score and location of UK Biobank centre. 
Model 2 adjusted for the covariates in Model 1 in addition to physical activity (MET.hours/week), frequency of alcohol intake, and smoking status. 
Model 3 adjusted for the covariates in Model 2 in addition to mean outdoor temperature. 
Model 4 adjusted for the covariates in Model 3 in addition to the time of day (morning, afternoon, evening) and day of week (weekend/weekday) of 
touchscreen assessment. This was examined in a separate model from Model 3 due to limited availability of time of day data, resulting in reduced sample 
size for Model 4. 
*Ethnicity covariate omitted due to collinearity. †Smoking status covariate omitted due to collinearity.    ‡ Physical activity log(1+x) transformed.

model to illustrate seasonal pattern. Means, SE and cosinor models are for the subsample of participants 
with data for all covariates. A) total depressive symptom score; B) low mood C) anhedonia; D) 
tenseness; E) tiredness. For tiredness (E), both unimodal and bimodal cosinor models are displayed, 
and the displayed acrophase is for the bimodal model. Acrophase is not displayed for tenseness (D) as 
evidence of seasonality was not revealed. SE = standard error; = acrophase.
