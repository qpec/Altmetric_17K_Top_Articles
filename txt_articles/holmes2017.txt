IMPORTANCE The utility of the focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST)
examination in children is unknown.
OBJECTIVE To determine if the FAST examination during initial evaluation of injured children
improves clinical care.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A randomized clinical trial (April 2012-May 2015) that
involved 975 hemodynamically stable children and adolescents younger than 18 years treated
for blunt torso trauma at the University of California, Davis Medical Center, a level I trauma
center.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly assigned to a standard trauma evaluation with the
FAST examination by the treating ED physician or a standard trauma evaluation alone.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Coprimary outcomes were rate of abdominal computed
tomographic (CT) scans in the ED, missed intra-abdominal injuries, ED length of stay, and
hospital charges.
RESULTS Among the 925 patients who were randomized (mean [SD] age, 9.7 [5.3] years; 575
males [62%]), all completed the study. A total of 50 patients (5.4%, 95% CI, 4.0% to 7.1%)
were diagnosed with intra-abdominal injuries, including 40 (80%; 95% CI, 66% to 90%)
who had intraperitoneal fluid found on an abdominal CT scan, and 9 patients (0.97%; 95% CI,
0.44% to 1.8%) underwent laparotomy. The proportion of patients with abdominal CT scans
was 241 of 460 (52.4%) in the FAST group and 254 of 465 (54.6%) in the standard care–only
group (difference, −2.2%; 95% CI, −8.7% to 4.2%). One case of missed intra-abdominal injury
occurred in a patient in the FAST group and none in the control group (difference, 0.2%;
95% CI, −0.6% to 1.2%). The mean ED length of stay was 6.03 hours in the FAST group and
6.07 hours in the standard care–only group (difference, −0.04 hours; 95% CI, −0.47 to 0.40
hours). Median hospital charges were $46 415 in the FAST group and $47 759 in the standard
care–only group (difference, −$1180; 95% CI, −$6651 to $4291).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among hemodynamically stable children treated in an ED
following blunt torso trauma, the use of FAST compared with standard care only did not
improve clinical care, including use of resources; ED length of stay; missed intra-abdominal
injuries; or hospital charges. These findings do not support the routine use of FAST
in this setting.

he focused assessment with sonography for trauma
(FAST) examination is used in the evaluation of injured
patients, with the goal of identifying hemoperitoneum
associatedwithintra-abdominalinjuries.Mostresearchregard-
ing the FAST examination has involved injured adults.1-3 Ad-
vantagesoftheFASTexaminationcomparedwithcomputedto-
mography (CT) include bedside availability during emergency
department (ED) evaluation or resuscitation, rapid comple-
tion, ability for serial examinations, performance and interpre-
tation by ED physicians, and lack of exposure to radiation. Al-
though the sensitivity of the FAST examination for detecting
hemoperitoneuminchildrenisinferiortoCT,4itsusemaysafely
decrease abdominal CT in selected patients.5,6
Evidence from randomized clinical trials involving
adults indicates that incorporating the FAST examination
during the initial evaluation resulted in decreased abdomi-
nal CT use, hospital lengths of stay (LOSs), complications,
and hospital charges.5,6
The FAST examination is not routinely used in the initial
evaluation of injured children, perhaps reflecting the ab-
sence of randomized clinical trials involving children. A 1999
survey of pediatric emergency medicine physicians sug-
gested that the FAST examination was used for less than 15%
of injured children evaluated for possible intra-abdominal
injuries.7 Similarly, in a 2007-2010 observational study con-
ducted in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Net-
work the FAST examination was used for 14% of children with
blunt torso trauma.8
The objective of this study was to determine if the FAST
examination performed during the initial evaluation of hemo-
dynamically stable children with blunt torso trauma de-
creases abdominal CT use, ED LOS, and hospital charges with-
out significantly increasing missed intra-abdominal injuries.
It was hypothesized that evaluating children with blunt torso
trauma with the FAST examination would result in improved
care and reduced costs.
Methods
Study Design and Setting
This randomized, nonblinded clinical trial involving children
with blunt torso trauma was conducted at the University of
California, Davis Medical Center, a large urban, level I pediat-
ric trauma center (April 2012-May 2015). The local institu-
tional review board approved the study (See the Supplement
for the study protocol). Once guardians of enrolled patients
arrived in the ED, they consented to participate in a tele-
phone follow-up.
Selection of Participants
Hemodynamically stable children and adolescents (<18 years)
with blunt torso trauma presenting to the ED within 24 hours
of the traumatic event were eligible. Inclusion and exclusion
criteria(Box)weredesignedtoidentifyastudypopulationwith
an approximate 5% risk of intra-abdominal injury.9 To assess
for enrollment bias, we collected basic information from all eli-
gible patients who were not enrolled.
Intervention
Children were stratified into 3 age categories (< 3 years, 3-9.99
years, and ≥10 years) and randomized in blocks of 20 within
theseagecohorts.Theallocationschedulewasgeneratedusing
random number functions in SAS software by the statisti-
cian. Bedside FAST examinations were performed on pa-
tients randomized to the FAST group by the ED physicians pro-
viding care. All ED physicians participating in this study were
requiredtobecertifiedinperformingFASTexaminationsbased
on guidelines of the American College of Emergency
Physicians.10 FAST examinations were performed using a por-
table ultrasound scanner with 3.5 MHz and 5.0 MHz transduc-
ers (Zonare Z One Ultra, Mindray). Patients underwent stan-
dardFASTexaminationsincludingviewsoftheMorisonpouch,
the splenorenal fossa, long and short axis of the pelvis, and
subxyphoid views. No attempts to image the solid organs or
intraperitoneal gutters were made because these views are not
routineintheFASTexamination.1,2AllFASTexaminationswere
uploaded and backed up on a server. Emergency department
physicians caring for the patients made bedside interpreta-
tions and recorded them on the data collection forms and on
the ultrasound at the time of imaging. Bedside FAST exami-
nation results were classified as positive if any intraperito-
neal fluid was identified or negative if no such fluid was noted.
FAST examinations were categorized as indeterminate if the
bedside physician was unable to make a definitive determi-
nation. For study purposes, all FAST examination results were
presented for interpretation to 1 of 2 experienced ED ultraso-
nographers (K.M.K., J.S.R.). These reviewers were masked to
all clinical data and categorized FAST examinations as posi-
tive, negative, or indeterminate for intraperitoneal fluid.
Data Collection
Emergency department physicians completed data collec-
tion forms at the initial evaluation and documented perti-
nent patient history and physical examination findings. All ef-
forts were made to minimize missing data during ED data
collection. Physicians documented their suspicion of intra-
abdominal injury, both before and after the FAST examina-
tion (in the FAST group), as one of the following: less than 1%,
1% to 5%, 6% to 10%, 11% to 50%, or more than 50%. In addi-
tion, physicians documented whether the FAST examination
Key Points
Question Does the focused assessment with sonography for
trauma (FAST) examination safely improve care when used in the
emergency department (ED) evaluation of hemodynamically
stable children with blunt torso trauma?
Findings In this trial of 925 hemodynamically stable children with
blunt torso trauma, randomization to the FAST vs standard trauma
examination did not result in significant improvement in the rate
of abdominal computed tomographic scans, time in the ED,
hospital charges, or missed intra-abdominal injuries vs children
randomized to standard trauma evaluation.
Meaning The study findings do not support the routine use of
FAST in the ED for hemodynamically stable children with blunt
torso trauma.

 results changed their decision to obtain an abdominal CT scan.
Patient cases were managed by ED physicians, along with
pediatric surgeons, trauma surgeons, or both. Interactions be-
tween physicians were not dictated by study protocol. No pro-
tocolforobtainingabdominalCTwasinplaceduringthestudy.
Patients were hospitalized at the discretion of the treat-
ing physicians. Data from hospitalized patients’electronic
medical records were collected for determination of out-
comes by research coordinators masked to randomization
group. For those patients discharged from the ED, the guard-
ians were contacted 1 week after the ED visit. The telephone
survey assessed for any possible missed intra-abdominal in-
juries or abdominal CT scans performed after the ED visit. For
those guardians unable to be contacted after 6 telephone at-
tempts, the patient’
s medical records and ED and trauma pro-
cess improvement records were reviewed to identify any pa-
tients with possible missed injuries.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome measures were the rate of abdominal CT
use, missed intra-abdominal injuries, ED LOS, and hospital
charges. Abdominal CT use was defined as the proportion of
patientsundergoingabdominalCTscansduringtheirEDevalu-
ation or hospitalization. A missed intra-abdominal injury was
defined by diagnosis of such an injury after the patient left the
ED. The ED LOS was defined as the time from ED arrival to dis-
position determination (ie, writing of admission or discharge
orders). Hospital charges were collected from the study site’
s
billing office and reflect the total charges for the index ED visit
and hospitalization (if hospitalized).
Additional nonprespecified outcome data collected in-
cluded time to abdominal CT, hospital LOS, and physician sus-
picion of intra-abdominal injury before and after the FAST ex-
amination (for patients in the FAST group). Time to abdominal
CT was defined as the time from ED arrival to CT imaging.
Statistical Analysis and Sample Size Calculation
Sample size calculations were made a priori for all primary out-
come measures except missed intra-abdominal injury (due to
its expected infrequency). All sample size calculations as-
sumed an α of .05, under 2-sided hypothesis testing, and β er-
ror of .20 (power = 80%).
A 1-hour decrease in ED LOS was considered clinically im-
portant. Based on preliminary data from the study site includ-
ingahospitalizationrateof64%andameanEDLOSof8.1(SD,4)
hours for hospitalized patients and 5.1 (SD, 3) hours for dis-
chargedpatients,a1-hourdecreaseinEDLOSwouldrequire504
admitted patients and 284 discharged patients (788 total pa-
tients). This would allow detection of important differences in
analyses stratified by admission status in the hospitalized and
nonhospitalized patients, respectively. A 10 percentage-point
reductionintheabdominalCTratewasconsideredclinicallyim-
portant and feasible based on prior studies demonstrating a 16
percentage-point CT reduction in injured adults and a 13 per-
centage-point reduction in injured children with the use of the
FAST examination.6,8 Based on preliminary data demonstrat-
ing an abdominal CT rate of 60% among injured children, a
sample size of 776 patients was required. A 15% charge reduc-
tion (the charge for 1 abdominal CT scan) was considered im-
portant.Basedonpreliminarydatademonstratingmeancharges
of$36 491(SD,$29 537),916patientswererequiredtodetectthe
hypothesizedreductionof$5474.Hence,thelatteroutcomene-
cessitated setting our target sample size to 916.
Missing data were minimal; therefore, no statistical impu-
tation was performed. All continuous data except for hospital
chargesweredescribedasthemeanand1SDandcomparedusing
the t test. Hospital charges had a skewed distribution and thus
were reported as the median with first and third quartiles (in-
terquartile range [IQR]) and compared them using quantile re-
gression. Categorical data were compared using the χ2 test
for association, unless any expected cell frequencies were less
than 5, when the Fisher exact test was used. Agreement be-
tweentheEDphysicianandtheEDultrasoundexpertwasmea-
sured with a weighted κ (95% CI) for agreement (using the de-
faultChichetti-Allisonweights).TheMcNemarχ2testwasused
to compare differences in proportions between before and af-
ter FAST physician suspicion of intra-abdominal injury. All sta-
tistical tests were 2 sided with a P value of .05 considered sig-
nificant. Effect sizes summarizing between-group differences

 Coprimary Outcomes
No significant differences between groups were identified in
the rates of abdominal CT scans (difference, −2.2%; 95% CI,
−8.7% to 4.2%, P = .50), missed intra-abdominal injuries
(difference, 0.2%; 95% CI, −0.6% to 1.2%; P = .50), ED LOS
(difference,−0.04hours;95%CI,−0.47to0.40hours;P = .88),
or hospital charges (difference, −$1180; 95% CI, −$6651 to
$4291; P = .67; Table 2). One case of missed intra-abdominal
injury occurred in the FAST group. This patient was a 13-
year-old male struck by a car while riding his bicycle. He had
a negative FAST examination and had normal liver transami-
nases. Following ED observation, the patient underwent ab-
dominal CT for continued abdominal pain. Initial interpreta-
tion of the CT was negative and the patient was discharged
home. The following day a pediatric radiologist reinterpreted
the CT as showing a grade 1 liver laceration. The patient re-
turned to the ED and was admitted for observation.
Nonprespecified Analyses
Hospitalization and laparotomy rates and time to CT were not
significantly different between the 2 groups, but the hospital
LOS was shorter in patients randomized to the FAST exami-
nation (Table 2). All 9 patients undergoing laparotomy had ab-
dominal CT scans performed in the ED prior to laparotomy.
Fourteen patients (3%) were considered to have indetermi-
nate FAST examinations by the treating physicians and all un-
derwent abdominal CT scanning. Agreement in FAST interpre-
tations between the treating physicians and the ultrasound
expert reviewer was moderate (κ, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.30-0.60;
Table 3). Among the 19 patients in the FAST cohort who had
intra-abdominal injuries and intraperitoneal fluid on CT, the
treating physicians’FAST interpretations were 5 positive, 10
negative,and4indeterminate.Theultrasoundexpertreviewer
interpreted 6 positive, 12 negative, and 1 indeterminate.
In the FAST group, physician suspicion of intra-abdominal
injurydecreasedaftertheperformanceoftheFASTexamination
(Figure 2). The proportion of patients with physician suspicion
of intra-abdominal injury of less than 1% increased after the
FASTexamination(changeinproportion,0.15;95%CI,0.11-0.18;
P < .001).Similarly,theproportionofpatientswithphysiciansus-
picion of 5% or less increased following the FAST examination

 Discussion
Inthisrandomizedclinicaltrialofhemodynamicallystablechil-
dren treated in an ED following blunt torso trauma, the use of
the FAST examination compared with standard care only did
not improve any of the primary outcomes including resource
use, ED LOS, missed intra-abdominal injuries, or hospital
charges. Therefore, the study suggests that the routine use of
theFASTexaminationinhemodynamicallystablechildrenwith
blunt torso trauma may not be useful.
Theseresultsdifferfrom2earlierrandomizedclinicaltrials
involving injured adults.5,6 Both studies demonstrated sub-
stantial improvement in clinical care (decrease in abdominal
CT rate, complications, and charges) and improved patient
throughput of the patients randomized to undergo the FAST
examination. The current study identified decreased hospi-
tal LOS in the FAST group similar to 1 of the adult studies.5 This
finding, however, may be due to chance, and the clinical im-
portance of this difference is unclear.
The results of a large, multicenter observational study of
injured children suggested that children considered to be at
low risk of intra-abdominal injury (ie, 1%-10% pre-FAST risk
assessment of intra-abdominal injury) had a lower rate of ab-
dominal CT scans if FAST examinations were performed.8
In that study, the FAST examination had little effect on ab-
dominal CT use in children considered to have a risk of intra-
abdominal of more than 10%.8 A systematic review and meta-
analysis demonstrated that the FAST examination has a
negative likelihood ratio of 0.36 for hemoperitoneum, and
thereforeanegativeresulthasthelargestclinicaleffectonpost-
test probability of intra-abdominal injury when pretest sus-
picion is low.4 However, the FAST examination should not in-
fluence clinical decision making regarding CT use when
patients are considered at substantial risk.4
Despite the findings of the 2 randomized clinical trials of
adults and the large multicenter pediatric observational study,
there is little prior evidence supporting the routine use of the
FASTexaminationforchildrenwithblunttorsotrauma.Asingle-
center observational study (involving children) also ques-
tioned the utility of the FAST examination due to its limited
sensitivity (50%).11 Similarly, the results of a prospective obser-
vational study of 357 children undergoing FAST examinations
also suggests that the utility of FAST examinations is low due
to the low sensitivity (52%) and marginal negative likelihood
ratio (0.50). These results led the authors to conclude that a
negative FAST test result “aids little in decision making.
”12 The
resultsofourtrialsupportthisassertionbecausephysiciansdid
not frequently alter care based on the examination results.
In our study, the use of the FAST examination was associ-
ated with a decrease in physician suspicion of intra-abdominal
injury. This decrease was primarily seen in children initially
believed to have a 1% to 10% risk of intra-abdominal injury
prior to the FAST examination. Changes in physician suspicion
associated with the FAST examination, however, did not re-
sult in decreases in abdominal CT use.
This study excluded certain high-risk patients, such as
those with hypotension, for whom the FAST examination may
have the potential to be beneficial. The FAST examination is
considered the standard of care at the study site in hypoten-
sive injured adults13 and has a reported sensitivity of 100% for
hemoperitoneum in hypotensive injured children.14 Includ-
ing these high-risk patients in the current study may have im-
proved the sensitivity of the FAST examination.
Limitations
This study has certain limitations. First, it was performed at a
single site and specific aspects of clinical practice at the study
site may have influenced the results. Participating physicians
may have had preconceived notions regarding the utility of the

Seven patients had missing data for clinician suspicion of intra-abdominal injury
either before or after the focused assessment with sonography (FAST)
examination and are not included in this figure. Rows represent clinician
suspicion of intra-abdominal injury prior to performing the FAST examination.
Columns represent clinician suspicion of intra-abdominal injury after
performing the FAST examination; data represent No. (%) of patients.
The dark blue cells (diagonal) represent no change in clinician suspicion of
intra-abdominal injury after the FAST examination; light blue (above the
diagonal), increased clinician suspicion of intra-abdominal injury after the FAST
examination; and medium blue (below the diagonal), decreased clinician
suspicion of intra-abdominal injury after the FAST examination.

 FAST examination, which may have affected CT decision mak-
ing and care provided. Therefore, the results may not be gen-
eralizabletoothersites.Amulticenterrandomizedclinicaltrial
wouldmoredefinitivelyanswerthequestionregardingtheutil-
ity of the FAST examination for injured children. Second, de-
spite randomizing 925 patients, the study may not have been
adequately powered to detect small differences in outcomes
between the 2 groups or in different age strata.
Third, a population with an approximate 5% risk of intra-
abdominal injury was targeted. This was chosen because of the
limited test sensitivity of the FAST examination, and abdomi-
nal CT is likely indicated for most children with higher risk.
Thus, FAST test characteristics in the current study given this
selected patient population should be interpreted with cau-
tion. Fourth, the study measured and analyzed differences in
charges between the 2 groups. However, charges do not re-
flect the true cost of care that was delivered to the patient.
Fifth, because the intervention being studied must be
performed by the treating physician and the results known
to the physician providing care, the study was not blinded.
Research coordinators assessing outcomes, however, were
blinded to study group assignment. Finally, agreement
between the ED physicians and the ED ultrasound expert
was only moderate. However, the aim of the study was not
to assess agreement between physicians in the performance
of the FAST examination but rather to evaluate the effect of
the use of the FAST examination on clinical outcomes and
resource use.
Conclusions
Among hemodynamically stable children treated in an ED fol-
lowing blunt torso trauma, the use of the FAST examination
comparedwithstandardcareonlydidnotimproveclinicalcare,
including use of resources; ED throughput; intra-abdominal
injuries; or hospital charges. These findings do not support the
routine use of the FAST examination in this setting.
