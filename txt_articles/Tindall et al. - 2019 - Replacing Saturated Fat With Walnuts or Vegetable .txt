Background-—Walnuts have beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk factors, but it is unclear whether these effects are attributable
to the fatty acid (FA) content, including a-linolenic acid (ALA), and/or bioactives.
Methods and Results-—A randomized, controlled, 3-period, crossover, feeding trial was conducted in individuals at risk for
cardiovascular disease (n=45). Following a 2-week standard Western diet run-in (12% saturated FAs [SFA], 7% polyunsaturated FAs,
12% monounsaturated FAs), participants consumed 3 isocaloric weight-maintenance diets for 6 weeks each: a walnut diet (WD; 7%
SFA, 16% polyunsaturated FAs, 3% ALA, 9% monounsaturated FAs); a walnut FA-matched diet; and an oleic acid–replaced-ALA diet (7%
SFA, 14% polyunsaturated FAs, 0.5% ALA, 12% monounsaturated FAs), which substituted the amount of ALA from walnuts in the WD
with oleic acid. This design enabled evaluation of the effects of whole walnuts versus constituent components. The primary end point,
central systolic blood pressure, was unchanged, and there were no significant changes in arterial stiffness. There was a treatment
effect (P=0.04) for central diastolic blood pressure; there was a greater change following the WD versus the oleic acid–replaced-ALA
diet (�1.78�1.0 versus 0.15�0.7 mm Hg, P=0.04). There were no differences between the WD and the walnut fatty acid-matched
diet (�0.22�0.8 mm Hg, P=0.20) or the walnut FA-matched and oleic acid–replaced-ALA diets (P=0.74). The WD significantly
lowered brachial and central mean arterial pressure. All diets lowered total cholesterol, LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, HDL
(high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, and non-HDL cholesterol.
Conclusions-—Cardiovascular benefits occurred with all moderate-fat, high-unsaturated-fat diets. As part of a low-SFA diet, the
greater improvement in central diastolic blood pressure following the WD versus the oleic acid–replaced-ALA diet indicates
benefits of walnuts as a whole-food replacement for SFA.

eaths attributable to high blood pressure (BP), a major
risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
(CVD),1 rose by 37.5% from 2005 to 2015 in the United
States.2 Normal BP is defined as less than 120/80 mm Hg3
and predicts lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular
events.4 Central BP, also termed aortic pressure, more directly
indicates risk of major adverse cardiovascular events com-
pared with brachial BP and thus is also a target for reducing
CVD risk.5,6 A healthy diet is important for prevention and
management of elevated BP, and simple and effective dietary
recommendations are needed.
Walnuts are a rich source of polyunsaturated fatty acids
(PUFA), including the n-3 PUFA a-linolenic acid (ALA) and the
n-6 PUFA linoleic acid, and contain a proportionally greater
quantity of polyphenolic compounds compared with other tree
nuts and vegetable oils.7,8 Observational findings show an
association between ALA intake and lower brachial BP, and
clinical studies have demonstrated that ALA reduces brachial
BP.9–12 Because walnuts are rich in PUFA, particularly n-3

 PUFA, replacement of saturated fatty acids (SFA) with
unsaturated fatty acids from walnuts is a potential strategy
that aligns with current dietary guidelines and recommenda-
tions from authoritative organizations such as the American
Heart Association, the National Lipid Association, and the
American College of Cardiology to reduce CVD risk.13–16
Walnut consumption has been shown to consistently lower
LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol (LDL-C),17–21 but
less is known about the effects on other CVD risk factors. A
previous controlled feeding trial reported a reduction in
brachial diastolic BP (bDBP) following 6 weeks of walnut
consumption (37 g walnuts per day).18 However, it remains
unclear how walnut consumption affects central BP and
arterial stiffness. Furthermore, previous clinical trials have not
investigated whether the significant cardioprotective effects
of walnuts are attributable to the fatty acid profile, including
ALA, and/or the bioactive compounds they contain, such as
tocopherols and phenolics.
This controlled feeding study in adults with increased
cardiovascular risk tested the effects of macronutrient-
matched diets designed to be lower in SFA (according to
the 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans15) and
proportionately higher in unsaturated fatty acids derived from
(1) 57 to 99 g (2–3.5 oz) whole walnuts, (2) vegetable oils
providing a fatty acid profile identical to that of whole walnuts
without walnut bioactives, and (3) monounsaturated fatty
acids (MUFA) as oleic acid substituted for the ALA content of
walnuts. We hypothesized that the diet containing whole
walnuts would promote greater reductions in central BP and
other CVD risk factors, given the combination of fatty acids
and bioactives.
Methods
The authors declare that all supporting data are available in
the article (and in the online supplementary files).
Study Design and Randomization
This study was a randomized, crossover, controlled-feeding
trial conducted to examine the effect of a diet containing
whole walnuts (walnut Diet [WD]), a diet with the same fatty
acid composition as the WD but devoid of walnuts (walnut
fatty acid–matched diet [WFMD]), and a diet that replaced the
amount of ALA contributed by walnuts with oleic acid (oleic
acid replaces ALA diet [ORAD]). All other nuts were restricted
during the run-in and 3 diet periods. The study design is
depicted in Figure 1. Eligible participants completed a 2-week
run-in on a standard Western diet. After completion of the run-
in diet, baseline assessments were completed, and partici-
pants were randomized using a 6-sequence randomization
scheme
(computer
generated
using
Randomization.com
[http://www.randomization.com/] in blocks of 6). In random
order, participants consumed each of 3 diets for 6 weeks,
with compliance breaks after the first and second diet periods
(mean: 22.8 days; range: 1–164 days). Investigators and
study personnel involved in data collection and analysis were
blinded to treatment allocation. Only the Metabolic Diet Study
Center (MDSC) manager was aware of the treatment alloca-
tion to assign participants to the correct menus.
Figure 1. Study design for this randomized, 3-period, crossover,
controlled-feeding trial. ↑ indicates end point testing (vascular
assessment and fasting blood draw completed on the last 2 days
of the run-in diet and study diets). The average compliance break
between diet periods was 23 days. All foods and caloric
beverages were provided for all diet periods and the run-in diet.
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Replacing saturated fatty acids (FAs) with 57 to 99 g/d of
walnuts for 6 weeks reduced central diastolic blood pres-
sure compared with a diet similarly low in saturated FAs but
with lower a-linolenic acid content (a-linolenic acid was
replaced with oleic acid).
• None of the 3 treatment diets, which replaced saturated FAs
with unsaturated fats, altered markers of arterial stiffness
after 6 weeks.
• The effects observed in our study occurred in participants
with overweight and obesity, without concomitant changes
in body weight.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• This study represents a feasible food-based approach for
replacing saturated FAs with unsaturated FAs (including a-
linolenic acid) from walnuts and vegetable oils, demonstrat-
ing that relatively small dietary changes can reduce
cardiovascular risk.
• The reduction in central diastolic blood pressure in the
absence of changes in central systolic blood pressure or
arterial stiffness following a walnut-rich diet warrants further
investigation of a-linolenic acid–rich foods, including wal-
nuts.

 The primary end point for the study was central systolic BP
(cSBP). Secondary end points included central diastolic BP
(cDBP), central mean arterial pressure (cMAP) and brachial
MAP (bMAP), brachial SBP (bSBP) and bDBP, central pulse
pressure (PP) and brachial PP, augmentation pressure (AP),
augmentation index (AIx), heart rate, pulse transit time (PTT),
pulse-wave velocity (PWV), total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C, HDL
(high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol (HDL-C), non–HDL-C, TC:
HDL-C, triglycerides, glucose, insulin, and high-sensitivity C-
reactive protein (CRP). All procedures involving human
subjects were approved by the Institutional Review Board of
the Pennsylvania State University (University Park, PA).
Written informed consent was obtained from all participants
before enrollment in the study. All study samples were
collected and procedures were conducted at the Pennsylvania
State University Clinical Research Center (CRC). This trial is
registered as ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02210767.
Participants
Men and women with overweight and obesity (body mass
index [BMI; kg/m2], 25–40), aged 30 to 65 years, who had
LDL-C between the 50th and 90th percentiles from a
nationally
representative
sample22
(128–177 mg/dL
for
men and 121–172 mg/dL for women) and/or elevated
brachial BP (120–159/80–99 mm Hg for bSBP/bDBP) in
central Pennsylvania were eligible for this study. Exclusion
criteria included smoking; BP ≥160/100 mm Hg; and a
history of myocardial infarction, stroke, diabetes mellitus,
liver disease, kidney disease, thyroid disease (unless con-
trolled with medication), gastrointestinal diseases, and inflam-
matory diseases. Individuals taking the following supplements
or medications were excluded unless they were willing to
discontinue use before enrolling in and for the duration of the
study: nutritional supplements (eg, whey protein powder),
herbs, vitamins or minerals, NSAIDs, BP-lowering medications,
cholesterol-lowering medications or supplements (eg, psyl-
lium, fish oil capsules, soy lecithin, niacin, fiber, flax,
phytoestrogens),
and
stanol/sterol
supplemented
foods.
Women who were lactating, pregnant, or planning to become
pregnant were excluded from the study. Individuals who were
following a vegetarian or vegan diet or had nut allergies were
also excluded. Individuals who consumed >14 alcoholic drinks
per week before screening or who were not willing to maintain
their physical activity habits throughout the course of the
study were excluded.
Participant Recruitment
Participants were recruited from October 2014 to September
2017 via flyers posted on university and community bulletin
boards, local newspaper advertisements, radio advertise-
ments, campus email lists, and a university research website.
Potential participants emailed or called to indicate interest in
participating in the study and were then given additional
information about the study. If interested, individuals were
asked a series of medical history and lifestyle questions via a
telephone screening to obtain information about key inclusion
and exclusion criteria and to determine eligibility. Following
the telephone screening, an in-person screening appointment
was scheduled at the CRC to confirm eligibility. After a 12-
hour fast and avoidance of alcohol for 48 hours, individuals
had their height, weight (without shoes and in light clothing),
and resting BP measured (validated sphygmomanometer) by
trained nurses. The mean of the last 2 of 3 BP readings was
used to determine eligibility. A fasting blood sample was also
collected for a blood chemistry measurement and analysis of
lipids and lipoproteins.
Study Diets
Participants were fed isocaloric weight maintenance diets.
Energy requirements were calculated using the Harris-
Benedict equation,23 and adjustments were made as needed
throughout the course of the study. Diets were similar except
for the fatty acid profile and the presence or absence of
walnuts (Table 1). Differences in the nutrient profile of the
diets are entirely due to the different fatty acids supplied
through the study foods (Table 2). The run-in diet consisted of
a similar macronutrient profile as the test diets, but the
amount of SFA provided was representative of typical SFA
intake in the United States (12% of calories),24 and thus the
diet was proportionally lower in PUFA and MUFA compared
with the study diets. The WD included 18% of daily energy
from walnuts delivered as a snack (57–99 g/d, containing 5–
8.8 g/d ALA) and matched the macronutrient profile of the 2
other test diets. The WFMD provided the same amount of ALA
and PUFA as the WD but was devoid of walnuts (and walnut
bioactives). In the ORAD, 83% of ALA was replaced with oleic
acid, which is the amount of ALA delivered from walnuts in the
WD. The ORAD was also devoid of walnuts, and all other fatty
acids were held constant.
All diets used the same 6-day-cycle menu, developed using
Food Processor SQL software v10.8 (ESHA Research) and
prepared in the Pennsylvania State University MDSC. Partic-
ipants picked up food daily Monday through Friday. On
Fridays, participants were provided with a cooler containing
Saturday and Sunday meals and snacks. Compliance was
assessed using daily food logs that participants completed
and monitoring participant daily body weight logs kept at the
MDSC. Participants consumed noncaloric beverages ad libitum
but were limited to <1184 mL/d caffeinated beverages (5
cups per day) and ≤2 alcoholic drinks per week.

 Assessment of Outcome Measurements
Baseline and end point testing was conducted on the final
2 days of the run-in diet and the study diets. All study
procedures were
conducted at the Pennsylvania State
University CRC according to standardized procedures. Before
testing, participants were instructed to fast for 12 hours, to
take only preapproved medications, to avoid strenuous
exercise, and to refrain from consuming caffeine-containing
products and alcohol for 48 hours. At each visit, vascular
function testing was performed before blood sampling.
Fasting blood samples were collected by trained nurses for
analysis of lipids, lipoproteins, glucose, insulin, and markers of
inflammation.
BP and Vascular Measures
The SphygmoCor XCEL system (AtCor Medical) was used to
assess cSBP, cDBP, cMAP, bSBP, bDBP, bMAP, central and
brachial PP, AP, AIx (adjusted to a heart rate of 75 beats/
min), heart rate, PTT, and PWV. Before measurements,
participants were fitted with the correct size BP cuff, and
these cuffs were consistently used for the remainder of the
study. All measurements were performed by trained research
personnel in a quiet, temperature-controlled room.
Pulse wave analysis
The SphygmoCor XCEL system uses a brachial cuff–based
method to estimate central BP, AP, and AIx through a
generalized transfer function that has been validated against
the indwelling catheter method.25,26 Following a 5-minute
seated rest, measurements were taken 3 times, following the
guidelines of the Seventh Report of the Joint National
Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treat-
ment of High Blood Pressure,27 with a 1-minute rest period
between each measurement. The last 2 results were averaged
and used for analysis. If the brachial BP measurements were
inconsistent (ie, >10 mm Hg difference for SBP or >5 mm Hg
difference for DBP), a fourth reading was taken. The AIx was
standardized to a heart rate of 75 beats/min to correct for
the independent inverse effect of heart rate augmentation of
the pulse wave form and is reported as AIx.
Pulse wave velocity
Carotid to femoral PWV was assessed noninvasively using the
SphygmoCor XCEL system, the gold standard for noninvasive
measurement of arterial stiffness.28 Briefly, carotid and
femoral arterial pressure waveforms were simultaneously
captured via applanation tonometry of the carotid artery and a
femoral BP cuff according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Three PWV measurements were obtained in the supine
position, with the last 2 measures averaged for analysis.
Blood Sample Collection and Assay Methods
Blood was drawn into anticoagulated tubes containing lithium
heparin or EDTA and immediately centrifuged for 15 minutes.
Blood drawn into serum separator tubes was allowed to clot
for 30 minutes at room temperature and then centrifuged for
15 minutes. Serum TC, triglycerides, and plasma glucose
were directly measured using spectrophotometry at a certified
commercial laboratory (Quest Diagnostics). Non–HDL-C was
calculated by subtracting HDL-C from TC. LDL-C was calcu-
lated using the Friedewald equation (LDL-C=TC�[HDL-C+tri-
glycerides/5]); no participants had triglyceride values above
the limit for this equation.29 Serum high-sensitivity CRP was
measured using nephelometry, and insulin (serum) was
measured by immunoassay (Quest Diagnostics).
Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed with SAS (v9.4; SAS
Institute). All randomized individuals were included in the data
analyses for each outcome variable consistent with intent-to-
treat principles. Outcome variables were checked for normal-
ity (PROC UNIVARIATE), and positively skewed variables
(residuals skew >1; triglycerides and high-sensitivity CRP)
were logarithmically transformed. Individuals with acutely
elevated CRP (ie, high-sensitivity CRP ≥10 mg/L) values at
the end of diet periods were excluded from all CRP analyses
because such values are indicative of an acute infection.

 (PROC TTEST). The change from baseline following each
treatment, for each outcome measure, was calculated by
subtracting baseline measurements after the run-in diet from
post–diet-period values.
The mixed models procedure (PROC MIXED) was used to
assess effects of the study diets on outcome measures at a
predetermined a value of 0.05. The mixed models procedure
does not perform listwise deletion and preserves the degrees
of freedom, thus allowing for inclusion of participants with ≥1
missing data point in the analyses and permitting an intent-to-
treat approach to be used to analyze data from participants
who withdrew before completing all end point testing. The
primary analyses investigated whether there was a difference
in the change from baseline between the study diets for each
outcome; within-diet change from baseline was also deter-
mined. Secondary analyses were conducted for between-diet
mean values at the end of each diet period for all outcome
variables. Selection of model covariance structures was based
on optimizing fit statistics (evaluated as lowest Bayesian
information criterion). Baseline values were included as a
covariate for assessing differences between the mean values
of outcome variables. The effects of sex, randomization
sequence, and their interaction with diet were added to the
model to determine whether carryover or sex effects were
present. No carryover effects of the study diets were detected
for any outcome. The only variable with a significant sex9diet

 interaction was PTT. Tukey–Kramer-corrected P values were
used to correct for multiple comparisons.
Unblinded exploratory analyses were conducted to identify
potential predictors (ie, BMI) of participants’ responsiveness
to the different study diets. The predictor of interest, BMI, was
categorized into 3 classifications: overweight (25 to <30),
obese I (30 to <35), and obese II (35 to <40). The categorized
variable was added to the mixed model as a main effect, and
the interaction with diet was also examined.
Power for this study was calculated based on the primary
end point of cSBP. A sample size of 32 people was required to
provide 90% power to detect a 3�5-mm Hg difference
between the study diets with a 2-sided a=0.05.18
Results
Participants and Baseline Characteristics
A detailed diagram of the flow of participants through the
study is provided in Figure 2. Briefly, 99 participants were
consented and screened for eligibility, 45 were randomized,
and 36 completed the trial. The overall dropout rate after
randomization of eligible volunteers was 20%. Three partici-
pants dropped out during each of the 3 diet periods, resulting
in 7 participants not completing the WD and WFMD and 4
participants not completing the ORAD. Daily compliance with
the dietary protocol was 91% (median) among participants
who were included in data analyses (Table S1). Noncompli-
ance was considered to be any self-reported deviation from
the
controlled-feeding
dietary
protocol.
No
participants
reported any challenges in consuming the amount of walnuts
provided. Walnuts were given as an evening snack, but
participants had the option of consuming them throughout the
day. Baseline characteristics for participants who completed
the trial were not statistically different from participants who
did not complete the trial (Table S2). A similar number of men
and women were randomized to the study (Table 3). There
were no differences in baseline BMI, TC, LDL-C, non–HDL-C,
glucose, insulin, brachial BP, or central BP between men and
women. There were significant differences in age, HDL-C, TC:
HDL-C, central PP, AP, AIx, and PTT between men and women
at
baseline.
Participants
had
elevated
BP
(mean�SD:
121�11.2/77�7.8 mm Hg) and LDL-C (119.2�30.7 mg/
dL).
BP and Vascular Measurements
The WD, WFMD, and ORAD did not significantly change cSBP,
the primary end point, from baseline, and there were no
significant differences between diets for the magnitudes of
change (Figure 3, Table S3) or mean values (Table 4). There was
a main treatment effect of diet for cDBP (P=0.04) and a
significant
reduction
from
baseline
following
the
WD
(�1.8�1.0 mm Hg, P=0.02) only. Post hoc comparisons
showed a greater change from baseline for cDBP following
the WD compared with the ORAD (0.2�0.7 mm Hg, P=0.04),
but the changes were not different between the WD and the
WFMD (�0.2�0.8 mm Hg, P=0.2) or between the WFMD and
the ORAD (P=0.7). Mean cDBP was lower after the WD
(76.1�1.1 mm Hg) compared with the ORAD (78.3�1.1
mm Hg, P=0.02), but there were no differences between the
WD and the WFMD or between the WFMD and the ORAD. The
WD lowered brachial MAP (�1.4�0.7 mm Hg, P=0.04) and
cMAP (�1.7�0.8 mm Hg, P=0.02) compared with baseline,
but there were no differences between the diets. There were no
statistically significant changes from baseline, differences in
magnitudes of change, or diet effects for brachial SBP, bDBP,
brachial PP, central PP, AP, AI, heart rate, PTT, or PWV (Tables 4
and 5).
Lipids and Lipoproteins
The WD (�15.8�3.2 mg/dL; P<0.0001), the WFMD (�14.6�
2.9 mg/dL; P<0.0001), and the ORAD (�11.2�2.7 mg/dL;
P<0.0001) all significantly decreased TC from baseline, but the
magnitudes of change from baseline were not significantly
different
between
groups
(P=0.3;

and
the

(�9.2�2.3 mg/dL, P<0.0001) all significantly improved LDL-C
from baseline, with no differences between study diets (P=0.5).
The WD, WFMD, and ORAD also lowered HDL-C from baseline
(�1.8�0.8 mg/dL, P<0.0001; �2.1�0.9 mg/dL, P<0.0001;
�1.1�0.7 mg/dL, P<0.0001, respectively), with no differences
between study diets (P=0.4). Non–HDL-C was reduced following
the WD, WFMD, and ORAD (�14.0�2.9 mg/dL, P<0.006;
�12.5�2.5 mg/dL, P<0.0009; �11.0�2.2, P<0.03, respec-
tively; P=0.5 for differences between diets). The TC:HDL-C
decreased after the WD compared with baseline (P=0.03), but
there was no main effect of diet (P=0.5). Triglycerides did not

were no significant differences between group means for the 3
study diets for TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, non–HDL-C, TC:HDL-C, or
triglycerides (Table 5).
Glucose, Insulin, CRP, and Weight
There were no significant changes in glucose or insulin from
baseline or between diets for any of the 3 study diets. CRP
was decreased from baseline (�0.95�0.5 mg/L, P=0.049)
following the WFMD, but there were no significant differences
between study diets as end-of-treatment means or magni-
tudes of change (Table 5, Table S4). Weight was decreased
from baseline following the WD (�1.2�0.4 kg, P=0.003), the
WFMD (�0.8�0.4 kg, P=0.04), and the ORAD (�1.1�0.4 kg,
P=0.005), but there were no significant differences between
study diets as end-of-treatment means (P=0.37) or magni-
tudes of change (P=0.33).
Exploratory BMI Subgroup Analysis of Response
to Study Diets
There was an interaction between BMI category and cSBP
(P=0.04) but no overall diet effect. Individuals with obesity
(BMI 30 to <35; n=11) had a significant reduction in cSBP
following the WD (�6�2 mm Hg; P=0.001) and the WFMD
(�5�2 mm Hg; P=0.01) compared with baseline (Table 6).
Furthermore, individuals with obesity had a greater response
to the WD compared with individuals with morbid obesity (35
to <40; �6�2 versus 3�2; P=0.04; n=10). There were no
differences in the effect on cSBP between individuals in the
overweight (<30; n=24)
or morbidly obese categories.

Discussion
This study aimed to examine whether there were cardiovas-
cular benefits of replacing SFA with walnuts beyond their fatty
acid composition. Incorporation of 57–99 g/d (ie, 18% of
energy) of walnuts as a snack into a healthy dietary pattern
significantly lowered cDBP from baseline and to a significantly
greater extent than the ORAD. However, there was no effect
on cSBP, our primary end point. All 3 study diets improved
lipids/lipoproteins including TC, LDL-C, and non–HDL-C to a
similar extent. Consequently, in this study, favorable effects
were observed for all 3 study diets, supporting the cardio-
vascular benefits of replacing SFA with unsaturated fats,
which is consistent with the current evidence base.
To our knowledge, this study is the first to report that
walnut intake reduced cDBP. The clinical implications of
reducing cDBP are not completely understood, as this BP
measurement is relatively novel and the prognostic value has
not been assessed. However, bDBP, a target of the current BP
guidelines,3 was nominally reduced (P=0.051) and mirrored
the trends in cDBP. Our findings corroborate 2 previous
studies that reported a reduction in bDBP with walnut
consumption.18,30 Although a recent meta-analysis on walnuts
and CVD risk factors did not report a significant effect of
walnut consumption on BP, less than a third of the studies
included reported results for brachial BP. The authors are only
aware of 1 other study that has evaluated the effects of
walnuts on central BP. In that study,31 there was no

 significant change in brachial or central BP in healthy male
participants after 4 weeks of consuming 15 g/d walnuts
under free-living conditions.31 The dose of walnuts provided
was substantially less than the 57 to 99 g/d we provided in
our 6-week controlled feeding study. Thus, dose, duration of
walnut supplementation, and/or the participants studied
(healthy versus metabolic dysfunction) may explain the
discordance.
The significantly greater reduction in cDBP following the
WD compared with the ORAD diet may have been due to the
difference in fatty acid composition of the ORAD (lower PUFA
and higher MUFA) versus WD, although no difference was
detected between the WFMD and the ORAD, suggesting the
fatty acid profile may not explain the full effect observed. The
ORAD was also devoid of walnut bioactives. Thus, the effect of
the WD on cDBP appears to be due to both the unique fatty

 acid profile and the bioactive profile of walnuts (eg, phenolic
compounds). This result is consistent with evidence showing
that PUFA is more effective than MUFA for lowering CVD risk,
and clinical trials demonstrate that replacement of SFA with
oleic acid lowers risk to a lesser extent.3,14 This finding is of
relevance because high-oleic oils are being introduced into
the food supply as a replacement for PUFA-rich oils, and
concerns have been raised that an adequate intake of linoleic
acid and ALA will be difficult to obtain.32 Based on our results,
providing walnuts is a strategy for obtaining not only essential
fatty acids, which may become less abundant in the food
supply with the growing number of high oleic (and lower ALA)
fats and oils in the marketplace,32 but also walnut bioactives
that may contribute to BP benefits. Walnuts are one of the
richest plant sources of ALA33 and contain phenolic acids,
stillbenes, tocopherols, flavonoids, and melatonin.34–36 These
bioactives present in walnuts have in vitro antioxidant activity
and have been reported to reduce oxidative damage and
endothelial dysfunction.18,37 Although we did not see an
effect on arterial stiffness, we did observe reductions in cDBP
and central and brachial MAP following the WD that may be
due to different bioactive mechanisms including angiotensin-
converting enzyme inhibition, antioxidant, or other vasodila-
tory effects.38,39
Recent evidence has demonstrated that the potential
beneficial effects of walnut bioactives on BP may be related to
changes in the gut microbiome.40,41 The composition and
diversity of the gut microbiome has been associated with
various chronic diseases, including CVD.42,43 Walnuts are not
completely digested in the upper gastrointestinal tract, which
provides substrate to the gut microbiota44,45 and may
promote the production of short-chain fatty acids.40 Short-
chain fatty acids such as butyrate have been associated with
maintenance of normal BP.46 Specific types of bacteria, such
as Akkermansia munciniphila, have been reported to increase
with butyrate supplementation47 and are associated with
decreases in TNF-a (tumor necrosis factor a) mRNA, systemic
inflammation, and DBP. Microbial production of butyrate
through fermentation in the gut also may elicit the beneficial
effects observed with butyrate supplementation and, conse-
quently, may have a BP-lowering effect. However, further
research is needed to investigate the interaction among
walnut consumption, the gut microbiome, and BP.

 There is extensive research on the effects of walnut
consumption on lipids and lipoproteins. A recent meta-
analysis of 26 studies investigating the effects of walnut
consumption on cardiovascular risk found a significant
reduction in TC (3.25% greater reduction compared with
controls),
LDL-C
(3.73%),
triglycerides
(5.25%),
and
apolipoprotein B (�3.74 mg/dL compared with control
Western diets) following walnut consumption (15–108 g/d
for 4 weeks to 1 year).21 This result is consistent with our
finding of significant reductions in TC, LDL-C, non–HDL-C,
HDL-C, and TC:HDL-C following the WD versus the standard
Western run-in diet. The similarity in PUFA content of the 3
diets (16%, 16%, and 14% in WD, WMFA, and ORAD,
respectively) may explain why we did not observe a signifi-
cantly greater effect of the WD compared with the other 2
study diets, which also produced significant beneficial effects
on TC, LDL-C, non–HDL-C, HDL-C, and TC:HDL-C compared
with baseline. However, when we compared the observed lipid
changes in the current study with the predicted changes
calculated using the Mensink and Katan equation,48 we
observed greater reductions in TC (observed versus expected:
�15.8 versus �13.5 mg/dL) and LDL-C (�13.4 versus
�11.6 mg/dL) following the WD, whereas the observed
reductions following the WFMD were closer to the predicted
changes for TC (�14.6 versus �13.5 mg/dL) and LDL-C
(�11.1 versus �11.6 mg/dL). Differences in predicted
versus observed LDL-C–lowering effects are similar to other
study findings reported for tree nuts49 and, specifically,
walnuts.20,50 This suggests there may be an additive effect of
consuming whole walnuts as an SFA replacement versus
vegetable oils that provide the same fatty acid profile.
Obesity and hypertension are interrelated and can influ-
ence the response to both diet and drug treatments.51–53
Adipocytes from visceral fat secrete inflammatory markers
and angiotensinogen, an activator of the renin–angiotensin–
aldosterone system, which may result in hypertension.54
Metabolic changes that occur due to the expansion of adipose
tissue may affect the potency of dietary interventions; thus,
the wide range in baseline BMI in the present study (BMI 25–
38) may explain the lack of effect on cSBP and cMAP
following the study diets. Although there was not a diet effect
for our primary end point, cSBP, secondary analyses indicated
that BMI played a role in participants’ systolic BP response to
the study diets. We expected to see the greatest improvement
in central BP in either the overweight group (n=24), for which
obesity would not blunt the effects of the intervention, or in
the obese (n=11) and morbidly obese (n=10) categories,
with
the
highest
baseline
cSBP
(overweight:
108.9�
2.2 mm Hg; obesity: 113.8�2.2 mm Hg; morbid obesity:
113.8�2.5 mm Hg). However, we found that only individuals
with obesity (BMI 30.0 to <35) had a significant reduction in
cSBP and cMAP from baseline following the WD and the
WFMD, with no significant change from baseline in the
overweight or morbidly obese groups. Importantly, there were
no significant differences in weight change between groups
(P=0.20) that could account for this. Furthermore, we
observed greater reduction in cSBP and cMAP in individuals
with obesity compared with morbid obesity following the WD.
This suggests that changes in central BP following the
substitution of SFA with PUFA may be related to the degree of
metabolic abnormalities associated with overweight and
obesity. Relative to the obese group, individuals in the
overweight group may have fewer metabolic disturbances and
individuals in the morbidly obese group may have greater
metabolic disturbances that possibly blunted the response to
dietary treatment. Given the rising rates of obesity in the
United States and worldwide, further research investigating
the role of BMI in the response to dietary changes is
warranted.
A strength of this study was the use of a crossover design
that allowed participants to act as their own controls and
minimized the influence of between-subject variability on
treatment effects. This study represents a realistic food-based
approach to replacing SFA and demonstrates that relatively
small dietary changes can reduce cardiovascular risk. The
context of the background diets is important for the
incorporation of walnuts and addition of walnuts to a
Western-style diet would not result in the same cardiovascular
benefits. In addition, the controlled-feeding study design with
high rates of compliance, as assessed via daily questionnaire
and weight status, were additional strengths. The 6-week
feeding periods also provided a better understanding of the
longer term effects of different treatment diets compared with
a standard Western diet. However, the effect size was
overestimated (0.6) for the primary end point, and thus the
study
was
underpowered
to
detect
between-treatment
effects. To detect the observed effect size (0.14), �516
participants would have been required. Although the run-in
diet was designed as a Western-style diet with an SFA content
representing average American consumption, this diet likely
differed from participants’ habitual diets, particularly in SFA.
This may explain the improvement we observed in LDL-C
(�6.1�2.2 mg/dL; P=0.009) from the time participants were
screened to when they were randomized (baseline), although
regression to the mean is also likely. It is possible the LDL-C
lowering from the run-in diets blunted the effect of the study
diets.
In summary, our findings demonstrate that replacement of
SFA with PUFA from walnuts and vegetable oils and MUFA
from vegetable oils significantly reduces established cardio-
vascular risk factors, including TC, LDL-C, and non-HDL-C.
This study also provides evidence that walnuts decrease
cDBP. The results show that relatively small shifts from a
Western-style diet to dietary patterns with a favorable fatty
