IMPORTANCE Antibiotic therapy for acute uncomplicated appendicitis is effective in adult
patients, but its application in pediatric patients remains controversial.
OBJECTIVE To compare the safety and efficacy of antibiotic treatment vs appendectomy as
the primary therapy for acute uncomplicated appendicitis in pediatric patients.
DATA SOURCES The PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases and the
Cochrane Controlled Trials Register for randomized clinical trials were searched through April
17, 2016. The search was limited to studies published in English. Search terms included
appendicitis, antibiotics, appendectomy, randomized controlled trial, controlled clinical trial,
randomized, placebo, drug therapy, randomly, and trial.
STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials and prospective clinical controlled trials
comparing antibiotic therapy with appendectomy for acute uncomplicated appendicitis in
pediatric patients (aged 5-18 years) were included in the meta-analysis. The outcomes
included at least 2 of the following terms: success rate of antibiotic treatment and
appendectomy, complications, readmissions, length of stay, total cost, and disability days.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data were independently extracted by 2 reviewers. The
quality of the included studies was examined in accordance with the Cochrane guidelines and
the Newcastle-Ottawa criteria. Data were pooled using a logistic fixed-effects model, and the
subgroup pooled risk ratio with or without appendicolith was estimated.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the success rate of treatment.
The hypothesis was formulated before data collection.
RESULTS A total of 527 articles were screened. In 5 unique studies, 404 unique patients with
uncomplicated appendicitis (aged 5-15 years) were enrolled. Nonoperative treatment was
successful in 152 of 168 patients (90.5%), with a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effects risk ratio of
8.92 (95% CI, 2.67-29.79; heterogeneity, P = .99; I2 = 0%). Subgroup analysis showed that
the risk for treatment failure in patients with appendicolith increased, with a Mantel-Haenszel
fixed-effects risk ratio of 10.43 (95% CI, 1.46-74.26; heterogeneity, P = .91; I2 = 0%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This meta-analysis shows that antibiotics as the initial
treatment for pediatric patients with uncomplicated appendicitis may be feasible and
effective without increasing the risk for complications. However, the failure rate, mainly
caused by the presence of appendicolith, is higher than for appendectomy. Surgery is
preferably suggested for uncomplicated appendicitis with appendicolith.

A
cute appendicitis is one of the most common pediat-
ric emergencies.1 Since 1889, when McBurney2 first re-
portedappendectomyasthetreatmentforacuteappen-
dicitis, surgical intervention has been the standard treatment
strategyforacuteappendicitis.3,4Afterappendicitisisdiagnosed,

tion of nonoperative management with antibiotics in patients
with appendicitis.
Several randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have proven the
effectivenessandsafetyofnonoperativetreatmentforacuteap-
pendicitis in adult patients with uncomplicated disease,7,8,11-14
withsuccessratesrangingfrom63%to85%.Meta-analysesand
systematic reviews of such trials15-19 have yielded supportive
conclusions.However,owingtospecificanatomicalandpatho-
physiologic features of children, the clinical scenario of acute
appendicitisinpediatricpatientsisdifferentfromthatinadults,
and treatment decisions for children are more difficult.6 Re-
sults from previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses of
adult patients are not applicable to pediatric patients. The ex-
act clinical guidance for whether nonoperative treatment or
appendectomyshouldbeusedforpediatricpatientswithacute
appendicitis depends on results from large studies with pedi-
atric patients.
Some recent studies20,21 suggest that antibiotic treat-
ment may be a valid alternative to appendectomy in uncom-
plicated pediatric appendicitis. However, the sample sizes of
those studies were relatively small, and the conclusions were
inconsistent. The present meta-analysis aimed to compare an-
tibiotic treatment with appendectomy for the treatment of un-
complicated acute appendicitis in pediatric patients, with par-
ticular reference to safety and efficacy.
Methods
Study Selection
Randomized clinical trials and prospective controlled trials
comparing antibiotic treatment with appendectomy for non-
perforated acute appendicitis in pediatric patients (aged 5-18
years) were eligible for inclusion. Eligible studies were re-
quired to report at least 2 of the following outcomes: success
rate of antibiotic treatment and appendectomy (successful
treatment was defined as no complications and no recur-
rences within 1 month after hospital discharge), complica-
tions, readmissions, length of stay, total cost for hospital stay,
and number of days with disability. We limited the eligibility
to English-language studies.

Data Extraction
We defined the primary outcome as success rate in each group.
The secondary outcomes measured were time from assign-
ment to discharge, cost, and complications that were re-
ported by all studies, including complicated appendicitis and
postoperative complications.
Risk for Bias
Thequalityofcohortstudieswasmeasuredbyascoresystemand

total scores ranged from 0 (worst) to 9 (best) for cohort studies,
with a score of at least 6 indicating high quality. The quality of

Key Points
Question Are antibiotics as initial treatment appropriate for
uncomplicated acute appendicitis in pediatric patients?
Findings In this meta-analysis of 5 studies (including 404
patients), antibiotic treatment was safe and effective in 152 of 168
pediatric patients (90.5%), but the risk for treatment failure
increased significantly in patients with appendicolith.
Meaning Antibiotic treatment can be used as primary treatment
in pediatric patients presenting with acute uncomplicated
appendicitis without appendicolith.

plications and other outcome measures in the antibiotic and
appendectomy groups. We used the Mantel-Haenszel (M-H)
method to combine the summary statistics and assessed the
statistical heterogeneity by using the I2 method with the Ï‡2 test
to calculate P values. The potential for publication bias was
evaluatedbyvisuallyinspectingfunnelplots.Statisticalhetero-
geneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. Higher I2 values in-
dicate increased heterogeneity. The results were reported with
95% CIs, and P values, where appropriate, and the 5% level
(P < .05) was considered to indicate statistical significance.
Results
The online search identified 527 articles, as shown in eFigure
1 in the Supplement. After screening the titles, abstracts, and
trial registries, we excluded 459 records. A total of 68 full-
text manuscripts were examined. We included 6 trials in the
qualitative synthesis and 5 trials in the meta-analysis. The co-
hort study24 was excluded because the same group of pa-
tients was reported in another study by the same authors with
a longer follow-up period (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Four
single-centerprospectivenonrandomizedcontrolledtrials25-28
and 1 single-center RCT29 were included.
We summarized the characteristics of the 5 included stud-
ies.Atotalof404uniquepatientswithuncomplicatedacuteap-
pendicitis were assigned to the antibiotic treatment group
(n = 168)ortheappendectomygroup(n = 236).Diagnosisofsus-
pected acute appendicitis was obtained from the history, clini-
cal signs, radiographic evidence, and laboratory tests for in-

who were treated at other hospitals were excluded.
Primary Outcome
Success Rate of Treatment
Theprimaryoutcomeofthismeta-analysiswasthesuccessrate
of treatment. Treatment success was defined in the antibiotic
group as resolution of symptoms without the need for sur-
gery within 48 hours or recurrence of appendicitis within 1
month after treatment initiation. In the appendectomy group,
treatment success was considered as an operation without
negative appendectomy findings and/or reoperation.
In the antibiotic group, 16 of 168 patients (9.5%) pre-
sented with initial failures of antibiotic treatment; 11 patients
proceeded to have an appendectomy within 48 hours, and 5
patients experienced recurrence of appendicitis after 1-month
follow-up. All 16 patients were pathologically diagnosed with
appendicitis, with 3 of them having perforated appendicitis.
In the appendectomy group, no negative appendectomy find-
ings (0 of 236 patients) were observed, whereas 1 patient ex-
perienced a major complication that needed reoperation. Six
minor complications were reported by Tanaka et al27 and Min-
necietal26(detailsnotgiven),andallofthemweretreatedcon-
ventionally. Nonoperative treatment was successful in 152 of
168 patients (90.5%), with a risk ratio of failure of 8.92 (M-H
fixed-effects 95% CI, 2.67-29.79; heterogeneity, P = .99;
I2 = 0%) (Figure 1).
Failure Rate Associated With Appendicolith
Fourstudies25,27-29reportedthepresenceofappendicolith,with
3studies27-29notingthatappendicolithwasassociatedwithahigh
rateoftreatmentfailure;30patientswithappendicolithwereal-
locatedtotheantibioticgroup,and19patientswithappendico-
lith received initial appendectomy. In the study by Hartwich
etal,25nofecalith-associatedcomplicationsoccurredinthean-
tibiotic or the surgery group. Minneci et al26 excluded patients
with appendicolith in study criteria. We performed a subgroup
analysisbasedonthepresenceofappendicolith,whichshowed
an increased risk for initial fails and recurrent appendicitis
(Figure 2), with a risk ratio of 10.43 (M-H fixed-effects 95% CI,
1.46-74.26; heterogeneity, P = .91; I2 = 0%), and a lower risk in
patients without appendicolith (eFigure 2 in the Supplement),
with a risk ratio of 7.87 (M-H fixed-effects 95% CI, 1.80-34.33;
heterogeneity, P = .88; I2 = 0%).
Recurrence of Appendicitis Within 1 Year
Of the 168 patients allocated to the antibiotic treatment
group, 45 patients (26.8%) underwent appendectomy with
1-year follow-up. Twenty-seven patients (16.1%) were diag-
nosed with appendicitis using histopathologic findings; 6 of
these 27 patients had recurrence of appendicitis within 30
days, and all 6 patients were counted in the initial statement
of treatment failure. Moreover, 8 of 45 patients were diag-
nosed as having a normal appendix by histopathologic find-
ings. Seven of these patients underwent appendectomy
because of recurrent symptoms, and 1 asymptomatic patient
underwent appendectomy at parental request. Minneci
et al26 reported 7 recurrent appendicitis cases. In the study
of Svensson et al,29 7 patients received interval appendec-
tomy after discharge; 1 patient was diagnosed with recurrent
appendicitis by histopathologic findings, and the other 6
patients underwent appendectomy with a histopathologi-
cally normal appendix. Mahida et al28 and Tanaka et al27
reported 1 and 16 recurrent appendicitis cases after dis-
charge, respectively. Furthermore, Hartwich et al25 reported

4 instances of appendectomy in the antibiotic group during
the follow-up period; 2 were for recurrence of appendicitis,
whereas the other 2 were appendectomy with normal
appendix. Moreover, patients with appendicolith had a
higher rate of recurrent appendicitis than did patients with-
out appendicolith (10 of 30 [33.3%] vs 17 of 138 [12.3%]).

including ileus, surgical site infection, or other postoperative
readmissions for appendectomy. A forest plot (eFigure 3 in the
Supplement) shows a risk ratio of 0.65 (M-H fixed-effects 95%
CI, 0.18-2.37; heterogeneity, P = .51; I2 = 0%). No statistically
significant difference was detected in the prevalence of com-
plications between the antibiotic and appendectomy groups.
Cost
Three of 5 studies reported cost in the antibiotic and appen-
dectomy groups.25,26,29 Initial cost refers to the cost of initial
inpatient stay, whereas the total cost includes all the appen-
dicitis-associated costs. Moreover, the initial or total cost de-
creased in the antibiotic treatment group (eFigure 4 in the
Supplement and Figure 3). The mean difference between treat-
mentgroupsininitialcostinUS$1000wasâˆ’$0.70(inversevari-
ance fixed-effects 95% CI, âˆ’$0.89 to âˆ’$0.51; heterogeneity,
P < .001; I2 = 100%) and in total cost in US $1000 was âˆ’$1.31

Hospital Stay and Disability Days
Thelengthofhospitalstaywasreportedin3studies.26,27,29The
forest plot showed a significantly longer hospital stay in the
antibiotic group than in the appendectomy group (eFigure 5
in the Supplement); with a mean difference of 14.32 hours (in-
verse variance fixed-effects 95% CI, 7.49-21.15 hours; hetero-
geneity, P = .16; I2 = 46%). Furthermore, Minneci et al26 re-
ported the mean length of disability as 8 days (interquartile
range, 5-18 days) in the antibiotic group and 21 days (inter-
quartile range, 15-25 days) in the appendectomy group
(P < .001).
Discussion
Although well studied in adult patients, the feasibility and
safety of antibiotic treatment vs appendectomy for acute ap-
pendicitis in pediatric patients remain uncertain, with no pe-
diatric patientâ€“based meta-analysis available. The current

meta-analysis compared primarily the 2 different treatment
strategies for pediatric patients with acute appendicitis. Five
prospective clinical controlled trials were included, with 404
pediatric patients enrolled; the efficacy and safety were evalu-
ated in antibiotic treatment and appendectomy. The results
showed that the initial success rate of antibiotic treatment was
as high as 90.5%, with a risk for complications comparable to
that for appendectomy. Antibiotic treatment was associated
with higher risk for failure compared with urgent appendec-
tomy; 45 of 168 patients (26.8%) received interval appendec-
tomy because of treatment failure (10 patients), histopatho-
logically confirmed recurrence (27 patients), or a parentâ€™
s
demand (8 patients) during the 1-year follow-up.
We conducted a quality assessment on all the included
studies (eTable 2 in the Supplement). All 4 cohort studies used
the Newcastle-Ottawa criteria and scored at least 7, suggest-
ing that all the studies achieved moderate or high quality. One
RCT was rated as high quality by the Cochrane Collabora-
tionâ€™
s risk for bias assessment tool23 in accordance with the fol-
lowing criteria: adequate generated random sequence, not
double-blinded for patients and physicians, none of the pa-
tients were lost to follow-up during at least the 1-year fol-
low-up period, and a low risk for selective reporting.
Accurate diagnosis of acute appendicitis and differentiat-
ing uncomplicated from complicated appendicitis are of es-
sentialimportanceinevaluatingthetreatmentoptions.Insome
early studies, the misdiagnosis rate of patients with sus-
pected appendicitis was greater than 15%,30 with higher per-
centages in pediatric patients. Fortunately, the advancement
of imaging studies has reduced the negative appendectomy
rate. As shown in our review, the diagnosis of appendicitis was
supported by results of a physical examination, blood tests,
abdominal ultrasonography, or computed tomography in all
studies. None of the 236 initial surgical procedures resulted
in a negative appendectomy finding as determined by histo-
pathologic results.
Although the combination of clinical manifestation and
radiologic examination has a high level of accuracy in
detecting the presence of appendicitis, differentiation
between uncomplicated and complicated or perforated
appendicitis may be uncertain before the operation. Early or
uncomplicated appendicitis usually entails a recent onset
(<48 hours), a relatively lower white blood cell count
(<180 000/Î¼L [to convert to 109 per liter, multiply by
0.001]), absence of pan-peritonitis, and abscess or phleg-
mon or fluid collection at imaging. In this meta-analysis, 4
studies25-28 used stringent inclusion criteria that excluded
patients with symptom duration longer than 48 hours or a
white blood cell count of greater than 180 000/Î¼L; use of
these criteria helped decrease the risk for complicated
appendicitis. In the RCT by Svensson et al,29 a small propor-
tion of patients presented with a long symptom duration
and high white blood cell count, although the time to perfo-
ration and its clinical manifestation were variable; these fac-
tors may have affected the efficiency of nonoperative treat-
ment. Furthermore, the final histologic examination
revealed 3 cases of gangrenous appendicitis and 2 cases of
perforated appendicitis in the appendectomy group; 1
patient in the antibiotic group, returning after an initial
resolution in symptoms, was found to have perforated
appendicitis.
The presence of appendicolith is another major concern
when considering the application of nonoperative treat-
ment for acute appendicitis. Appendicolith may lead to
obstruction of the appendix lumen. Approximately 10% of
patients with appendix inflammation are diagnosed with
appendicolith, which often occurs in children or young
adults.31 Many studies14,32-34 reported that the presence of
appendicolith was associated with high risk (â‰¤40%) for
complicated appendicitis. Some studies35,36 also showed
that the presence of appendicolith may increase the risk for
recurrent appendicitis. In the 5 studies included in this
meta-analysis, Minneci et al26 defined the presence of feca-
lith as an exclusion criterion, and the 4 other studies25,27-29
reported the presence of appendicolith in the included
patients. Mahida et al28 focused on patients with acute
appendicitis and appendicolith, but the study ended mid-
way because of a high failure rate of antibiotic treatment
and a high rate of complicated appendicitis found in the
surgical group. In the study by Svensson et al,29 3 of 5
patients with appendicolith (60%) in the antibiotic group
finally received appendectomy. In the study of Tanaka
et al,27 9 of 19 patients with appendicolith (47%) experi-
enced failure of initial antibiotic treatment compared with

24% of patients who did not. The increased risk for nonop-
erative treatment failure was confirmed in our subgroup
analysis, with a risk ratio of 10.43 (M-H fixed-effects 95% CI,
1.46-74.26; heterogeneity, P = .91; I2 = 0%). Altogether, 15 of
30 patients with appendicolith (50%) in the antibiotic group
underwent appendectomy. Therefore, considering the avail-
able evidence, researchers have found the application of
nonoperative treatment for acute appendicitis with appen-
dicolith to be inappropriate. Larger clinical trials are needed
to further reveal precise indicators to guide the treatment of
acute appendicitis with appendicolith.
The type and duration of antibiotic treatment may also
influence the outcomes. Three studies25,26,28 reported that a
combination of piperacillin sodium and tazobactam sodium
and a combination of oral ampicillin sodium and clavulanate
potassium were used as the main therapeutic agents in the
antibiotic group. Svensson et al29 used meropenem, oral cip-
rofloxacin hydrochloride, and metronidazole hydrochloride.
Tanaka et al27 reported a sequence in which cefmetazole
sodium was the initial treatment, and when symptoms were
not alleviated, a combination of sulbactam sodium and
ampicillin and ceftazidime sodium were used. Other pos-
sible treatments included meropenem or a combination of
imipenem and cilastatin, as well as gentamicin sulfate. All
patients were primarily treated with third-generation cepha-
losporins, carbapenems, or penicillins. All classes of drugs
were effective broad-spectrum antibiotics, and previous
guidelines suggested the use of effective antibiotics in the
treatment of intra-abdominal infections.37 Four studies26-29
reported that prophylactic antibiotics were administered
intravenously until 48 hours after surgery, which may have
influenced the outcomes in the appendectomy group. In the
study by Hartwich et al,25 the perioperative administration
of antibiotics was not clearly elucidated. Although all the
studies focused on antibiotic therapy, the type, duration,
and dose were different in various studies, and no standard
criteria were determined for the antibiotic treatment of
appendicitis. The use of antibiotics based on clear criteria
needs to be determined in additional studies.
Increased length of hospital stay has been an issue regard-
ing the efficacy of antibiotic use as the primary treatment for
appendicitis. The lengths of hospital stay in antibiotic groups
varied among different studies,26,27,29 depending on the regi-
men and type of antibiotic prescribed. Meta-analyses showed
significantly longer hospital stays in the nonoperative treat-
ment group; 2 studies stipulated 24 hours26 or 48 hours29 of
intravenous antibiotic treatment, and the patients were dis-
charged only when tolerating a regular diet. In the trial by
Tanaka et al,27 the patients were hospitalized with continu-
ous intravenous injection of antibiotics until total clinical re-
lief was achieved. This relatively strict standard of discharge
in clinical trials may partially explain the longer hospital stays
in the antibiotic group; such time in a real-life setting can be
reduced. Moreover, the number of disability days was fewer
for patients treated with antibiotics than for patients who un-
derwent surgery in the trial by Minneci et al.26
The cost of initial inpatient stay was lower for nonoper-
ative treatment in our meta-analysis (mean difference [in US
$1000], âˆ’$0.70; inverse variance fixed-effects 95% CI, âˆ’$0.89
to âˆ’$0.51; heterogeneity, P < .001; I2 = 100%). Furthermore,
because of the high success rate in all the included studies, the
total appendicitis-associated cost of attempting nonoper-
ative treatment in uncomplicated appendicitis is lower after
taking treatment failure, recurrence, and elective appendec-
tomyratesintoaccount(meandifference[inUS$1000],âˆ’$1.31;
inversevariancefixed-effects95%CI,âˆ’$1.69toâˆ’$0.92;hetero-
geneity, P = .72; I2 = 0%). However, primary failure and recur-
rent appendicitis are associated with high total cost for pa-
tients with these situations. In the trial by Hartwich et al,25 the
mean (SD) costs of urgent appendectomy, successful antibi-
otic treatment, recurrent appendicitis, interval appendec-
tomy, and initial failure of antibiotic treatment were $4130
($909), $1365 ($247), $5046 ($1952), $5702 ($933), and $8049
($205),respectively.Toincreaseefficiency,acautiousselection
of patients when considering nonoperative treatment in acute
appendicitis is very significant.
The avoidance of appendectomy is one of the most im-
portant advantages of nonoperative treatment. Of note, in the
trials by Svensson et al29 and Hartwich et al,25 patients in the
antibiotic group undergoing interval appendectomy because
of recurrent symptoms or parental request with no evidence
of appendicitis in histologic examination had significantly in-
creased hospital stays and costs. The necessity of interval ap-
pendectomy after successful nonoperative treatment for un-
complicated appendicitis is limited. In the retrospective study
by Puapong et al,38 61 patients with acute appendicitis under-
went successful nonoperative management, and only 5 (8%)
developed recurrent appendicitis. Moreover, in a systematic
review that focused on complicated appendicitis,39 the risk for
recurrence in patients who did not undergo interval appen-
dectomy was similar to the risk for morbidity associated with
interval appendectomy. In our review, the true recurrence rate
(confirmed by histopathologic examination) after successful
antibiotic treatment is 27 of 168 patients (16.1%) during the
1-year follow up, and 10 of the patients with recurrence pre-
sented with appendicolith. However, results from our meta-
analysis showed that nonoperative treatment was not sug-
gested for patients with appendicolith. The recurrence rate can
be further reduced if patients with appendicolith are ex-
cluded from nonoperative treatment in future studies or in
clinical practice. In summary, because the recurrence rate is
low after initial successful antibiotic treatment for uncompli-
cated appendicitis, interval appendectomy could only serve
as a backup intervention.
Limitations
One of the major limitations of this study is that only 1 RCT
and 4 prospective cohort studies were included. Nonethe-
less, all included studies were of high quality in accordance
with the Newcastle-Ottawa criteria or the Cochrane Collabo-
rationâ€™
s risk for bias assessment tool (eTable 2 in the Supple-
ment). A 1-year follow-up period was reported in 4 studies.
However, Mahida et al28 ended their study because of a high
failure rate in the group receiving antibiotics; the mean
follow-up period in their study was 4.7 months, which may
have led to a risk for bias.

Conclusions
This meta-analysis provided valuable evidence regarding the
outcomes of antibiotic treatment vs appendectomy as initial
treatment for pediatric patients with acute uncomplicated ap-
pendicitis. The results from the present study show that an-
tibiotic treatment is feasible and effective, with a high rate of
success; the risk for treatment failure is higher than that for
appendectomy; the presence of appendicolith increases the
rateoffailureofantibiotictreatment;andinitialtreatmentwith
antibiotics alone is not associated with increased complica-
tions.Thecostoftheinitialhospitalstayandtotalappendicitis-
related cost of antibiotic treatment were significantly lower
than those of urgent appendectomy. The presence of appen-
dicolith is the main cause for the failure of antibiotic treat-
ment. Surgery is preferably suggested for uncomplicated ap-
pendicitis with appendicolith, but the patients who could be
cured by conservative treatment need to undergo more de-
tailed clinical evaluation. Larger clinical trials are needed to
reveal more precise indications to guide the treatment of acute
appendicitis with appendicolith.
