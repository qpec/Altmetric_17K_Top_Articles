Background: The authors sought to model the different trajectories of psychotic-like experiences (PLE) during
adolescence and to examine whether the longitudinal relationship between cannabis use and PLE is mediated by
changes in cognitive development and/or change in anxiety or depression symptoms. Methods: A total of 2,566
youths were assessed every year for 4-years (from 13- to 16-years of age) on clinical, substance use and cognitive
development outcomes. Latent class growth models identified three trajectories of PLE: low decreasing (83.9%), high
decreasing (7.9%), and moderate increasing class (8.2%). We conducted logistic regressions to investigate whether
baseline levels and growth in cannabis use were associated with PLE trajectory membership. Then, we examined the
effects of potential mediators (growth in cognition and anxiety/depression) on the relationship between growth in
cannabis use and PLE trajectory. Results: A steeper growth in cannabis use from 13- to 16-years was associated
with a higher likelihood of being assigned to the moderate increasing trajectory of PLE [odds ratio, 2.59; 95%
confidence interval (CI), 1.11–6.03], when controlling for cumulative cigarette use. Growth in depression symptoms,
not anxiety or change in cognitive functioning, mediated the relationship between growth in cannabis use and the
PLE moderate increasing group (indirect effect: 0.07; 95% CI, 0.03–0.11). Conclusions: Depression symptoms
partially mediated the longitudinal link between cannabis use and PLE in adolescents, suggesting that there may be
a preventative effect to be gained from targeting depression symptoms, in addition to attempting to prevent cannabis
use in youth presenting increasing psychotic experiences. Keywords: Psychotic-like experiences; trajectory;
cannabis use; mediation; depression symptoms; anxiety symptoms; cognitive function.
Introduction
In the perspective of an extended psychosis pheno-
type, a promising approach was proposed by Kelle-
her,
Harley,
Murtagh,
and
Cannon
(2011)
and
Laurens et al. (2007) to study children and young
adolescents from the general population who report
subclinical psychotic-like experiences (PLE), without
the confounds of iatrogenic effects, such as medica-
tion, and major social and cognitive impairment.
Developmentally
sensitive
designs
can
provide
important insights into environmental risk factors,
such as early onset and rapid growth in cannabis
use, associated with subclinical PLE.
Psychotic-like experiences are defined as percep-
tual abnormalities (e.g. mild hallucinatory experi-
ences) and delusional thoughts that fall well below
DSM-5 diagnostic criteria of psychosis (Kelleher &
Cannon, 2016; van Os, Linscott, Myin-Germeys,
Delespaul, & Krabbendam, 2009). The prevalence
of PLE in the general population is estimated at 6%–
10% (van Os et al., 2009) and rises to 13%–15% in
adolescent samples (Laurens et al., 2007; Poulton
et al., 2000). Of note, having reported these experi-
ences is associated with increased odds (4–16) to
develop a psychotic disorder over the longer term
(Poulton et al., 2000; Werbeloff et al., 2012), particu-
larly if PLE are persistent overtime (Dominguez, Wich-
ers,Lieb, Wittchen, & van Os, 2011). Besides psychotic
illnesses,PLE during adolescencebecomeincreasingly
associated with general Axis I disorders (Fisher et al.,
2013; Kelleher et al., 2012). Based on a developmen-
tally informed longitudinal design, Mackie, Castel-
lanos-Ryan, and Conrod (2011); Mackie et al. (2013)
demonstrated using data from two large community-
based samples that PLE consistently follow three
developmental trajectories across adolescence: a low
decreasing (>80% of youths), an increasing (8%) and a
systematically elevated trajectory (5%). Altogether,
these results stress the importance of studying the
longitudinal development of PLE, specifically in youth,
in order to distinguish those with a more persistent
trajectory of psychotic experiences considered to be of
more clinical significance from those whose PLE may
betransitoryornonproblematicandmaynevercometo
clinical attention.
According to two meta-analyses examining the
increased risk for psychotic symptoms and diagnoses
in cannabis users, the magnitude of the effect
appears to be dose-dependent, influenced by age of
cannabis use initiation, and premorbid psychosis
vulnerability (Moore et al., 2007; Semple, McIntosh,
& Lawrie, 2005). These effects remained significant
when accounting for tobacco use. Specifically, on the

 temporal relation between cannabis use and psy-
chotic symptoms, prospective studies demonstrated
that cannabis use increases the risk of later incident
psychotic symptoms, and not the opposite (Kuepper
et al., 2011). However, most of studies focusing on
the association between cannabis and psychotic
symptoms have used binary classification (i.e. any
level of users vs. nonusers) or cumulative consump-
tion to describe cannabis use behaviors (Arseneault
et al., 2002; Di Forti et al., 2014; Moore et al., 2007).
Unfortunately, static descriptions of the association
between these variables do not allow to disentangle
the impact of different rates of cannabis use growth
in early onset relative to late onset users on psy-
chotic symptomatology development. To our knowl-
edge,
only
one
study
has
modeled
change
in
cannabis use from a more dynamic perspective
(Kelley et al., 2016) which can help to clarify the
developmental pathways between patterns of con-
sumption and psychotic symptoms. Considering the
imminent Canadian cannabis legalization, the rela-
tionship between cannabis use and PLE needs to be
addressed more thoroughly from a Canadian com-
munity-based cohort.
When investigating potential mediating factors of
the relationship between cannabis and psychotic
experiences,
some
authors
have
proposed
that
impairments in cognitive development due to canna-
bis misuse exacerbate psychotic experiences (Solowij
& Michie, 2007). Indeed, low premorbid cognitive
functioning is associated with and predates the onset
of a psychotic disorder (Reichenberg, 2005). A meta-
analysis of studies on clinically high risk individuals
for psychosis concluded that alterations in cognitive
functions were present in the following domains:
social cognition, episodic and working memory, ver-
bal fluency and executive functioning (effect sizes
ranging from �0.55 to �0.22, respectively) (Fusar-Poli
et al., 2012). A study investigating 9- to 12-year olds
reporting PLE found impairments in working mem-
ory, inhibitory control, verbal memory and IQ func-
tions in these preteenagers (effect sizes ranging from
�0.95 to �0.54) (Cullen et al., 2010). In addition,
regular cannabis use has been shown to negatively
impact executive functioning, inhibitory control and
attention performance in youth populations specifi-
cally (Castellanos-Ryan et al., 2016; Fontes et al.,
2011; Meier et al., 2012). From a neurophysiological
perspective, cannabis exposure in youth is associated
with structural alterations of the medial temporal (i.e.
amygdala and hippocampus), frontal and cerebellar
regions (Volkow et al., 2016), alterations that are
known to precede a diagnosis of psychosis (Fusar-Poli
et al., 2011). Altogether, these studies underline
certain similarities between the cognitive endopheno-
types
of
psychosis
and
the
resulting
cognitive
deficits from cannabis use (Solowij & Michie, 2007),
suggesting a potential causal relationship between
cannabis-induced cognitive changes and psychosis
during adolescence.
In
the
same
vein,
the
important
comorbidity
between anxiety and depressive disorders with sub-
clinical symptoms of psychosis (Fusar-Poli, Nelson,
Valmaggia, Yung, & McGuire, 2014) as well as the
elevated prevalence of anxiety and depression in
cannabis users (Leweke & Koethe, 2008) have led
the scientific community to investigate potential
mediational effects (Reeves et al., 2014). Anxiety and
depression symptoms often precede the onset of
psychosis (Fusar-Poli et al., 2014), while the anxio-
genic and depressogenic effects of heavy cannabis use
and cannabis use disorders have been well-documen-
ted (Kedzior & Laeber, 2014; Lev-Ran et al., 2014).
The goals of the present study were twofold. Our
first aim was to investigate the relationship between
cannabis use and PLE trajectories (Mackie et al.,
2011, 2013; Wigman et al., 2011) by focusing on the
dynamic modeling of adolescent cannabis use (early
onset and growth) in a Canadian sample of 13-year
olds followed for 3 years. The second goal was to test
whether the longitudinal relationship between can-
nabis use and PLE is mediated by changes in
cognitive functioning or by changes in anxiety and/
or depression symptoms across adolescence.
Methods
Participants
A total of 3,826 Grade 7 adolescents (mean, (SD); 12.8 years
old (0.4); 49.2% girls) from 31 secondary schools in the greater
Montreal area participated in this study. The schools were
initially recruited to take part in an ongoing cluster random-
ized controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of school-
based personality-targeted interventions on substance use and
cognitive outcomes (O’Leary-Barrett et al., 2017).
The participants were invited to complete a confidential
annual web-based survey during class time (from Grade 7 to
Grade 10, from 13- to 16-years old) to assess clinical, cogni-
tive, and psychoactive substance use information. Twelve
months separated each assessment. Quality control and
reliability of the data were evaluated using a sham drug item,
reverse items on various questionnaires and scripts to detect
inconsistent or unlikely reporting. Data on cognitive tasks were
further quality controlled with the exclusion of participants
whose performance was below what could be expected by
chance or outside a normal response range (e.g. reaction time).
Confidentiality was assured by emphasizing that parents and
teachers would not have access to the survey results and by
automatically anonymizing the assessments. Details of the
exclusion criteria are reported in the Supplement material.
Ethical approval was obtained from the CHU Sainte-Justine
Research Ethics Committee in Montreal. Depending on the
school, either passive or active parental consent was obtained.
All students actively assented to participate.
Among the 3,826 adolescents who were invited to complete
the survey annually, 3,612 (94.4%) passed the quality control
of the different questionnaires and reported minimal demo-
graphic information (sex, age, socioeconomic status – SES). Of
these, 2,566 youths (71.0%) were included in the final analyses
as they had at least two data points out of four on every
measure of interest for this study (i.e. psychotic experiences,
substance use, cognitive functioning, anxiety, and depression
symptoms). Attrition was predicted by older age (p = .018) as
well as higher baseline levels of
externalizing behaviors
(p = .001), higher frequency of cannabis use (p = .028), poorer

mance. However, attrition was not predicted by either sex
(p = .795), baseline SES (p = .998), the different PLE trajecto-
ries (p = .617), baseline depressive (p = .476) and anxiety
symptoms (p = .257), baseline delayed memory performance
(p = .132),

performance
(p = .058).
Measures
Dependent
variable.
Psychotic-like
experiences
(e.g.
hallucinations, delusional beliefs, suspiciousness, strange
experiences, and feelings of grandiosity) in the past 12 months
were assessed with nine items, five of which were adapted from
the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (Costello, Edelbrock, Kalas,
Kessler, & Klaric, 1982). All items were previously validated in
community samples of children and adolescents (Laurens,
Hobbs, Sunderland, Green, & Mould, 2012; Laurens et al.,
2007). The list of items is reported in the Supplement material.
Participants were asked to rate their response to different
statements on a 3-point scale (0 = not true; 1 = somewhat
true; 2 = certainly true). Individual item scores were summed
to obtain a global score of PLE. Kelleher et al. (2011) reported
that three questions (i.e. auditory and visual hallucinations,
feeling of being spied upon) presented positive predictive power
(ranging from 80% to 100%) for interview-verifiable PLE.
Cronbach’s a ranged from .80 to .83 between baseline and
third follow-up.
Independent variable.
Self-reported cigarette and can-
nabis use frequency were assessed with a modified and vali-
dated version of the ‘Detection of alcohol and drug problems in
adolescents’ questionnaire (Germain et al., 2013). Participants
were asked to rate their frequency of use over the previous
12 months on a 6-point scale (0 = Never, 5 = Every day).
Potential mediators.
Depressive and anxiety symptoms
severity in the past 12 months were measured using the
depression and anxiety subscales of the Brief Symptoms
Inventory (Derogatis, 1993). Global cognitive functioning (IQ)
was assessed with the Cultures Figures Task, a modified
version of the Cattel’s Culture Fair Test (Cattell, 1949) which
evaluates
perceptual
reasoning.
Spatial
working
memory
(SWM) was measured with the ‘Find the Phone’ task which is
based on the Self-Order Pointing Task (Cragg & Nation, 2007).
Delayed memory recall (30 min) was assessed with digital
analogue of the Dot Location test of the Child Memory Scales
(Cohen, 1997). Response inhibition was measured with an
adaptation of the Go/No-Go Passive Avoidance Learning
Paradigm (Newman & Kosson, 1986) represented by the total
number of commission errors across all the no-go trials.
Covariates.
Baseline SES was assessed using the Family
Affluence Scale for Adolescents (Currie, Elton, Todd, & Platt,
1997) and baseline externalizing behaviors (i.e. conduct and
hyperactivity problems) with the Strengths and Difficulties
Questionnaire (SDQ) (Goodman, Renfrew, & Mullick, 2000).
The SDQ is a brief behavioral screening questionnaire for 3–
16 years olds assessing internalizing (i.e. emotional and peer
relationships problems) and externalizing behaviors. Partici-
pants provided information about their gender and age. For a
more detailed description of the study measures, see Appendix
S1 accompanying the online version of this article.
Statistical analyses
Data were analyzed using MPLUS version 7.3. First, group-
based trajectories of PLE were estimated using growth mixture
models (GMM). Models were fitted beginning with a one-
trajectory model and moving to a four-trajectory model, all
with random starting values. The best-fitting model was
established using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC),
the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), the Lo-Mendell-Rubin
Likelihood Ratio Test (LMR-LRT), and entropy. Missing data on
the dependent variable (PLE score) were handled through Full
Information Maximum Likelihood.
Second, we examined whether change in cannabis use from
13- to 16-years was associated with the PLE trajectories. We
estimated growth of cannabis use across the four different time
points with unconditional latent-growth curve models. Good-
ness-of-fit indicators included the comparative fit index (CFI)
and the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR)
where, as Hu and Bentler (1999) proposed, a model with
CFI > 0.95 and SRMR < 0.08 is considered to have a good fit.
We extracted the intercept and slope values for each partici-
pant from the unconditional latent-growth models. Then, we
conducted multinomial and binary logistic regressions with
random cannabis intercept and slope factors to predict the
posterior probabilities of PLE trajectory membership.
Third, to investigate whether the relationship between
growth in cannabis use and PLE trajectory (i.e. the moderate
increasing trajectory vs. the low decreasing trajectory) is
mediated by change in anxiety or depression symptoms or
cognitive functioning, we estimated growth of these mediators
using unconditional latent-growth curve model across the four
time points. Then, linear regressions were used to estimate the
relationship between growth in cannabis and growth of poten-
tial mediators (a pathway), and logistic regressions to test the
relationship between growth in cannabis use, growth in
potential mediators and PLE trajectory membership (c and b
pathways). A bias corrected bootstrap procedure (5,000 boot-
strap resamples) was used to obtain 95% confidence interval
(CI) for direct and indirect effects (Imai, Keele, & Tingley, 2010).
All the regression models included a cluster-level variable (i.e.
schools) to account for the nonindependence of observations.
Results
Psychotic-like experiences trajectories
Consistent with previous trajectory modeling of PLE, a
three-class trajectory model (Figure 1) fitted the data
best
(BIC = 39,532.6,
AIC = 39,456.6,
entropy =
0.87, LMR-LRT: p = .004) compared to a two-class
model. Although moving from a three- to a four-class
model produced small decreases in both the BIC and
the AIC (BIC = 39,209.9, AIC = 39,110.5), we opted
for the three-class model as the LMR-LRT coefficient
was no longer significant (p = .113) and a group from
the four-class model was relatively small (3.8%,
N = 98) (For model fit information see Table S1). The
trajectories include a low decreasing class (N = 2,152,
83.9%) who presented mild, slightly decreasing psy-
chotic experiences, a high decreasing class (N = 203,
7.9%), who presented initially elevated levels of PLE
which decreased over the subsequent time points,
and a moderate increasing class (N = 211, 8.2%)
characterized by intermediate levels of PLE at baseline
(a total score of 5, meaning that most of these
individuals endorsed five different items to a mild
extent) that increased over time.

Mediators of cannabis use and psychotic-like trajectories

 Unconditional growth models for the independent
variable and potential mediators
Linear growth functions provided good fit indicators
for cannabis use, cognitive functioning and symp-
toms severity data (Table 2). The growth curve factor
means and variances were all significantly different
from 0 at p < .01. All models showed an overall
tendency to increase from 13- to 16-years old (except
for the SWM and response inhibition data for which
the number of errors is decreasing with age). Please
refer to Figures S1 and S2, accompanying the onlive
version of this article, for the visualisation of the
variables’ linear growth functions.
Association between change in cannabis use and
PLE trajectory
Both
the
unadjusted
and
adjusted
models
for
cumulative cigarette use show that a steeper growth
in cannabis use frequency was associated with
greater odds (Odds ratios ranging from 2.59 to
3.28)
of
belonging
to
the
moderate
increasing
trajectory relative to the other two groups (Table 3).
However, the intercept of cannabis use frequency
(mean = 0.05; suggesting onset for a small propor-
tion of individuals but low level of use) was not
associated with the PLE classes in any of the
models.
Testing potential mediators
Indirect pathways were estimated when both a and b
pathways were significant. In the cognitive function-
ing mediations, among the different a pathways,
growth in cannabis use was only significantly asso-
ciated with growth in commission errors of the
response inhibition task (b = .12; 95% CI, 0.03–
0.21), that is, a slower improvement in response
inhibition with time. For b pathways, none of the
cognitive growth factors were significantly associated
with the moderate increasing trajectory of PLE,
except for a marginal effect of growth in response
inhibition (b = .12; 95% CI, 0.00–0.24), that is, a
slower improvement in response inhibition with time
was associated with the moderate increasing trajec-
tory of PLE. The specific indirect effect from growth
in cannabis use to the moderate increasing trajec-
tory through growth in response inhibition perfor-
mance was also marginally significant (0.01; 95% CI,
0.00–0.03).
Among the potential psychopathologic mediators,
we showed that positive growths on depression and
anxiety measures were significantly associated with
membership of the moderate increasing PLE trajec-
tory (depression: b = .25; 95% CI, 0.17–0.32; anxi-
ety:
b = .40;
95%
CI,
0.28–0.53).
Furthermore,
growth in cannabis use frequency was positively
related to growth in depression symptoms (b = .29;
95% CI, 0.15–0.42), not anxiety. The specific indirect
effect from growth in cannabis use to the moderate
increasing trajectory through growth in depressive
symptoms
was
0.07
(95%
CI,
0.03–0.11),
and
explained 12.1% of the direct effect (Table 4). We
further examined the potential confounding of early
depression levels on the indirect effect by adding
baseline depression symptoms as a covariate, and
obtained a significant indirect effect of .05 (95% CI,
0.01–0.08).
Discussion
Using a large community sample and yearly assess-
ments of substance use, cognitive function and
psychiatric symptoms, this unique study contri-
butes to the literature on cannabis use as a risk
factor for early psychotic symptoms by identifying
mediators of the relationship between growth in
cannabis use frequency and PLE trajectory. The
data confirm the presence of three distinct PLE
trajectory classes manifesting during adolescence
(13–16 years old): low decreasing (83.9%), moderate
increasing (8.2%) and high decreasing trajectories
(7.9%). The proportion of individuals assigned to
each class matched those reported by Wigman et al.
(2011) and by our previous studies (Mackie et al.,
2011, 2013). However, in addition to the three
trajectories, Wigman and colleagues identified a
relatively low prevalence fourth group for which
PLE were consistently elevated over time. In the
current study, the four-class trajectory model, which
was not the best fitting and most parsimonious
model, included that same low prevalence trajectory
with persistently elevated PLE (3.8%). The major
difference between the samples is that Mackie’s team
observed no high decreasing trajectory; instead they
observed
an
‘elevated’
trajectory
that
declined
abruptly by 14.5 years of age. According to the
present and Wigman’s results, it seems that Mackie’s
‘elevated’ trajectory might be a combination of both a
high early decreasing trajectory with a persistently
elevated trajectory. It could be hypothesized that this
‘elevated’ trajectory may emerge in different samples,
such as older populations, or larger samples.
One of the novel components of this study was the
way in which adolescents’ developing cannabis use
was
modeled
using
a

and psychotic symptoms using age of cannabis
onset or cumulative use data (Arseneault et al.,
2002; Di Forti et al., 2014), our models allow for
the estimation of interindividual variability in pat-
terns of change over time and thus, help to disen-
tangle the impact of different rates of cannabis use
growth relative to onset of use on the development of
psychotic symptomatology. Previous findings linking
cannabis use to increasing PLE (Mackie et al., 2011,
2013) were only able to test the impact of cannabis
use onset. Our study demonstrated that, when
accounting for the growth in cannabis use fre-
quency, use at baseline or early initiation was not
related to any PLE trajectory. Rather, it was the
growth in cannabis use frequency that was signifi-
cantly associated with membership to the moderate
increasing PLE trajectory relative to the other two
groups, suggesting a gradient of effect between
increasing cannabis use and increasing PLE. Ado-
lescents were shown to be at 159% increased odds of
being classified in the increasing PLE trajectory for
every unit increment in the cannabis frequency scale
(which ranges from no use, occasional use, once a
month, once a week, couple times per week, to every
day). Altogether, these findings are consistent with a
recent study evaluating the different patterns of
change in cannabis use on subsequent psychosis
onset (Kelley et al., 2016). The authors reported that
(a) the steeper the growth in cannabis use in the few
years before conversion to psychosis, the higher the
risk of conversion, and (b) those with an early onset
of cannabis use who follow a decreasing trajectory of
use have a similar risk of psychosis onset to
nonusers (Kelley et al., 2016). Therefore, it seems
that both age of onset and cumulative use informa-
tion are insufficient measures and are likely to
underestimate the real-life impact of cannabis use
on psychotic symptoms.

aAll the unconditional latent-growth curve models were estimated over the four time points (i.e. 13–16 years old), except for the
unconditional latent-growth curve model of delayed memory recall growth which was estimated over three time points (i.e. 13–
15 years old) because performances plateaued at the 3rd follow-up (i.e. 16 years old) and thus the variance was reduced.
The growth curve factor means were all significantly different from 0 at p < .001 and showed an overall tendency to increase from
13- to 16-years old (except for the SWM and response inhibition data for which the number of errors is decreasing with age). Growth
curve factor variances were also all significantly different from 0 at p < .01.

Josiane Bourque et al.
 While mounting evidence supports the potential
role of cigarette use as a confounding factor when
investigating the link between cannabis and psy-
chosis (Gage et al., 2014), we showed that growth in
cannabis use was still associated with increasing PLE
when controlling for cigarette use. Accordingly, this is
consistent with meta-analyses showing that cannabis
use is an independent risk factor for psychotic
symptoms (Moore et al., 2007; Semple et al., 2005).
Individual patterns of change over time in cognitive
functioning and affective symptoms were similarly
modeled in our adolescent sample to test for a
potential mediation of the longitudinal link between
cannabis use and increasing PLE. Our results show
that apart from a marginal effect of response inhibi-
tion, there was no association between change in
cognitive functioning and PLE trajectory member-
ship. Those with a poorer growth on response inhi-
bition performance were more likely to be classified in
the moderate increasing PLE group. These results
seem to be inconsistent with the emerging literature
on adolescents with PLE (Cullen et al., 2010), studies
on schizophrenia patients’ offspring (Niemi, Suvi-
saari, Tuulio-Henriksson, & Lonnqvist, 2003), and
meta-analyses of high risk individuals who will
subsequently develop schizophrenia (Dickson, Lau-
rens, Cullen, & Hodgins, 2012), all reporting mild to
moderate deficits in various cognitive domains during
adolescence,
particularly
IQ,
memory,
executive
functions, attention, as well as processing speed.
However, most of the above-cited literature looked at
cross-sectional differences in cognition between at-
risk and low-risk youth and did not use longitudinal,
multi-level modeling to examine this relationship.
Our findings only mildly support the mediating role of
altered cognitive development on the relationship
between cannabis and PLE, with growth in response
inhibition
performance
being
the
only
cognitive
domain shown to be associated with cannabis use
and mediating its relationship to PLE. These results
are in accordance with recent findings from our team
demonstrating that cannabis use has a neurotoxic
effect that is specific to response inhibition, as
opposed to a general impact on cognitive functioning
(Morin et al., in revision).
In the same vein, we demonstrated that steeper
growths in anxiety and depression symptoms were
associated with the increasing trajectory of PLE
relative to the low decreasing trajectory (control
group), suggesting that both anxiety and depression
symptoms evolve concomitantly with increasing PLE.
The results are consistent with research from the
IMAGEN study demonstrating that a limbic hyper-
sensitivity to neutral facial expressions, a core
feature of both depression and anxiety disorders
(Bourke, Douglas, & Porter, 2010; Cooney, Atlas,
Joormann, Eugene, & Gotlib, 2006), was associated
with the presence of psychotic symptoms at 2-year
follow-up (Bourque et al., 2017). Additionally, we
showed that there was a significant indirect effect
from growth in cannabis use to the increasing PLE
trajectory through growth in depressive symptoms.
These findings are in accordance with three previous
studies in young adults showing cross-sectional
mediation or moderation relationships from depres-
sive/anxiety symptoms on the link between canna-
bis use and psychotic experiences (Najolia, Buckner,
& Cohen, 2012; Reeves et al., 2014; Spriggens &
Hides, 2015). Interestingly, these results are also
supported by the reported acute effects of cannabis.

All models included age, sex as well as baseline sociodemographic status, externalizing behaviors and cannabis use (intercept) as
covariates. The outcome (trajectory of psychotic-like experiences) is coded: 1 = moderate increasing trajectory, and 0 = low
decreasing trajectory (control group). Mediation/indirect effects were examined only when mediators had significant (or marginal) a
and b pathways.
Indirect effects were tested with MacKinnon’s products of coefficients method with a logistic outcome. Indirect estimates in boldface
represent significant indirect pathways.
aAll growth factors (slopes) were estimated from unconditional latent-growth curve models over the four time points (i.e. 13–16 years
old), except for the delayed recall memory growth which was estimated over three time points (i.e. 13–15 years old) because
performances plateaued at the 3rd follow-up (i.e. 16 years old) and thus the variance was reduced.

Mediators of cannabis use and psychotic-like trajectories
7
 Indeed, Freeman et al. (2015) showed that it is not
the cognitive deficits exacerbated by intravenous
administration of THC that lead to paranoia, rather it
is the increase in negative affect (anxiety, worry,
depression, and negative thoughts) that result in
paranoiac symptoms. However, it should be noted
that the indirect effect from growth in depression
symptoms was modest and might be better captured
using other measures of this cannabis effect (e.g.
such as cognitive or neural indices) or more specific
self-report depression symptoms (e.g. insomnia or
poor
concentration).
These
questions
could
be
addressed in future studies examining the coevolu-
tion of specific depressive symptoms with cannabis
use and/or PLE. The clinical implications of these
results nevertheless highlight the need for reducing
cannabis use in high risk adolescents, as well as the
importance of addressing depressive symptoms in
programs aimed at preventing increasing PLE in high
risk youth.
The main limitation of the study is that substance
use and symptoms severity were based on self-
report, which is susceptible to bias. However, previ-
ous work has shown good sensitivity and specificity
using the same items to identify interview verifiable
PLE (Kelleher et al., 2011). Similarly, self-reported
measures of substance use have previously demon-
strated excellent discriminant (Clark & Winters,
2002), and predictive validity (White & Labouvie,
1989) with regards to adolescent substance-related
behaviors problems. Other potential limitations are
the lack of cannabis potency information and the
low prevalence of regular cannabis users (20% of
16 years olds used at least on a monthly basis) in
this sample, however, the study was designed and
powered to detect small effects of cannabis, while
controlling for other covariates.
Conclusion
Using a developmentally sensitive design, this study
was able to examine the longitudinal emergence and
development of psychotic experiences and cannabis
use
in
a
young
Canadian
community
sample.
Moreover, this study contributes to our knowledge
of the role of depression symptoms, cannabis use
and psychotic experiences in developmental psy-
chopathology pathways. Further research needs to
replicate the present findings by investigating more
closely into the sequence of events between the three
phenomena.

Key points
• The magnitude of the increased risk for psychotic symptoms in cannabis users appears to be dose-dependent,
influenced by age of cannabis use initiation, and premorbid psychosis vulnerability.
• The present results show that growth in cannabis use frequency during adolescence, not early onset of use
(before 14 years old) was related to an increasing trajectory of psychotic-like experiences, even when
controlling for cigarette use.
• The present study supports the role of increasing depression symptoms as a mediating factor between growth
in cannabis use and an increasing trajectory of psychotic-like experiences in adolescents.
• There is a need for reducing cannabis use in high risk adolescents, as well as addressing depressive symptoms in
programs aimed at preventing increasing psychotic-like experiences in high risk youth.
