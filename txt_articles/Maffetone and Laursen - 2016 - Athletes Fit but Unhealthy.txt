Athletes: Fit but Unhealthy?
Philip B. Maffetone1 and Paul B. Laursen2,3*
Abstract
While the words “fit” and “healthy” are often used synonymously in everyday language, the terms have entirely
separate meanings. Fitness describes the ability to perform a given exercise task, and health explains a person’s
state of well-being, where physiological systems work in harmony. Although we typically view athletes as fit and
healthy, they often are not. The global term we place on unhealthy athletes is the overtraining syndrome. In this
current opinion, we propose that two primary drivers may contribute to the development of the overtraining
syndrome, namely high training intensity and the modern-day highly processed, high glycemic diet. Both factors
elicit a sympathetic response through the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, in turn driving systemic reactive
oxygen species production, inflammation, and a metabolic substrate imbalance towards carbohydrate and away
from fat oxidation, manifesting in an array of symptoms often labeled as the overtraining syndrome. Ultimately,
these symptoms reveal an unhealthy athlete. We argue that practitioners, scientists, and athletes may work towards
health and alleviate overtraining syndrome by lowering training intensity and removing processed and/or high
glycemic foods from the diet, which together enhance fat oxidation rates. Athletes should be fit and healthy.
Key Points
1. Fitness and health can be defined separately: fitness
describes the ability to perform a given exercise task,
and health explains a person’s state of well-being,
where physiological systems work in harmony.
2. Too many athletes are fit but unhealthy.
3. Excess high training intensity or training volume
and/or excess consumption of processed/refined
dietary carbohydrates can contribute to reduced
health in athletes and even impair performance.
Background
This current opinion piece combines the art and science
perspectives of a clinician/coach (PM) and an applied
sport scientist/physiologist (PL), both with specializa-
tions
in
endurance
performance.
Our
collaboration
arises from a mutual respect for contributions to endur-
ance athlete performance, as well as a shared primary
observation—that of fit, but unhealthy recreational and
professional/elite athletes.
Health and Fitness: Separate and Equally
Important
The term unhealthy athlete sounds, at first blush, like a
paradox. The magazine cover image of an athlete per-
forming her event in all its glory with flexed, lean mus-
cles, bronzed skin, and glowing good looks may be
perceived as the pinnacle of health. The internal working
state of that athlete, however, may be at arm’s length
from genuine health. In actuality, an athlete can be fit
but unhealthy (Fig. 1).
While the terms “health” and “fitness” are often used
interchangeably, we offer separate definitions:
– Health: a state of complete, mental, social, and
physical well-being, where all bodily systems (nervous,
hormonal, immune, digestive, etc.) function in
harmony
– Fitness: the quality of being able to perform a
specific physical task, which includes exercise and
sports
Poor health can be observed in athletes who adhere to
sport’s global “no pain, no gain” mentality, who may
push themselves beyond a point of appropriate system
stress [1, 2]. This includes physical injury (e.g., neuromus-
cular dysfunction), biochemical injury (e.g., endocrine and
immune dysfunction), and/or mental-emotional injury

 (e.g., depression). Each injury, in turn, could potentially
cause other signs and symptoms indicative of poor health.
The overreaching label we place on many athletes present-
ing with various combinations of these injuries is the over-
training syndrome [3]. The mechanisms leading to this
condition can vary considerably, across different levels of
training history and ability (recreational, non-elite, elite
athletes), age, genders, and sports (dependent upon their
aerobic and/or anaerobic metabolic requirements). The
wide spectrum of various potential injuries is listed in
Table 1 [4].
Important determinants of population health include
genetic predispositions, social circumstances, environ-
mental conditions, behavioral patterns (including diet and
exercise), and medical care [5]. Fitness factors contribut-
ing to the various conditions of the overtraining syndrome
may be similar and are certainly multifaceted, interrelated,
and complex [3]. Our opinion, based on practical experi-
ence and growing support from the scientific community,
is that there may be two modifiable primary drivers of
these injuries. This includes training intensity and the
modern diet. Both appear to conflict with our genetic
makeup [1], and both influence an important biochemical
characteristic—the oxidation of fat for fuel [6].
Our Athletic Origins
From the emergence of the human genus, Homo, about
2.4 million years ago, our ancestors survived as hunter-
gatherers for approximately 84,000 generations. They re-
quired large expenditures of energy on a daily basis derived
from lipid oxidation that supported the primary activities
of walking, slow running, resting, and the occasional sprint,
while adapting to a rapidly evolving glucose-based brain
[7]. More recently, dramatic advances in technology by the
agricultural (350 generations), industrial (7 generations),
and digital (2 generations) revolutions have left us with a
population that is genetically adapted for the demands of
life as a forager in the wild, but living in a high-tech,
generally sedentary, overfed, and emotionally stressful
twenty-first century world [8]. While the majority of
the population today suffers from the problem of inactiv-
ity, there is a smaller group, namely athletes, which may
be exercising excessively, or at a level inappropriate to
maintain optimal health [4].
Our bodies obtain substantial energy from stored body
fat, even in the leanest of individuals. Lipid oxidation,
the biochemical conversion of stored body fat for aerobic
energy, also has a mechanical element, the slow-twitch
aerobic muscle fibers [9]. As the name implies, these fibers
are enlisted during slower or lower-intensity activities and
play an important role in the health of skeletal and joint
support, vascularization, and antioxidant activity [9].
These fibers and their lipid-derived fuel supply form a crit-
ical component of the aerobic system for endurance, de-
fined here as the ability to train and compete over longer
timeframes, with less fatigue and at faster paces [10].
Diet
Today’s diet is typically high in refined carbohydrate, in-
cluding various forms of sugar, which many athletes er-
roneously believe is necessary for better performance
[11, 12]. However, a diet high in refined carbohydrate is
also high glycemic, which can promote poor health [13,
14]. In the short term, refined carbohydrates, whether in
the form of sugar or refined flour, can impair fat oxida-
tion rates [13, 15] and contribute to the production of
inflammation and pain [16, 17] and increased reactive
oxygen species (ROS) production [14]. Over time, this
can create hyperinsulinemia and chronic inflammation,
also associated with reduced health [18]. Other dietary
factors such as excess alcohol, excess omega-6 lipid con-
sumption, trans fatty acids and others, along with various
lifestyle factors including stress and excess exercise, can
also contribute to chronic inflammation [14].
Training Trauma and Inflammation
Associated with the above potential training and dietary
problems are a variety of physical, biochemical, and
mental-emotional injuries (Table 1). Whether we call
these different components of overtraining syndrome or
not, it is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the
autonomic nervous system that play key roles, creating
sufficient stress to cause system injury on various levels,
and ultimately maladaptation [16, 17, 19].

 While acute inflammation is a normal response to exer-
cise training and helps athletes recover and adapt, inappro-
priate training intensity, volume, or both, especially when
combined with a high glycemic/refined CHO diet, can re-
sult in chronic inflammation and pain [16, 17], increased
ROS [14], a compromised nervous system [19], and various
symptoms of maladaptation [2]. This may contribute to a
wide spectrum of undesirable health outcomes [19] that
may vary considerably among athletes and can include
plantar fasciitis, tendonitis, or stress-related health
impairment as part of the overtraining syndrome and
chronic disease risk (Table 1).
Potential Solutions
Notwithstanding a multitude of other potentially contrib-
uting factors to the various injuries outlined, addressing
the possible damaging effects of excessive high-intensity
training and/or poor diet is an important consideration.
While high-intensity training can be important to imple-
ment in moderation and at the right time [20] for certain
elements of sport performance [21], it does little to en-
hance fat oxidation rates [22], unlike lower-intensity aer-
obic training [23]. Likewise, reducing refined carbohydrate
content from an athlete’s diet and replacing these calories
with healthy/natural carbohydrate and fat over prolonged
periods can increase both lipid oxidation rates and various
markers of metabolic health [13, 15].
From a practical standpoint, the modification of the
diet and/or training programs as indicated can improve
health while increasing fitness, potentially through the
mechanisms discussed above.
Conclusions
Physical, biochemical, and mental-emotional injuries are
not expected/normal outcomes from endurance sport par-
ticipation, yet the incidence of these in athletes is alarm-
ingly high. Practitioners, coaches, and athletes should be
cognizant of impending health abnormalities during train-
ing and consider periods of reduced training intensity and
recovery, while emphasizing a natural, unprocessed diet to
improve health and cultivate sustainable fitness. For opti-
mal performance, athletes must be fit and healthy.
