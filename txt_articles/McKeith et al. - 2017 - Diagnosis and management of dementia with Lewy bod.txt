Diagnosis and management of dementia
with Lewy bodies
Fourth consensus report of the DLB Consortium
ABSTRACT
The Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) Consortium has refined its recommendations about the
clinical and pathologic diagnosis of DLB, updating the previous report, which has been in wide-
spread use for the last decade. The revised DLB consensus criteria now distinguish clearly
between clinical features and diagnostic biomarkers, and give guidance about optimal methods
to establish and interpret these. Substantial new information has been incorporated about pre-
viously reported aspects of DLB, with increased diagnostic weighting given to REM sleep
behavior disorder and
123iodine-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy.
The diagnostic role of other neuroimaging, electrophysiologic, and laboratory investigations
is also described. Minor modifications to pathologic methods and criteria are recommended to
take account of Alzheimer disease neuropathologic change, to add previously omitted Lewy-
related pathology categories, and to include assessments for substantia nigra neuronal loss.
Recommendations about clinical management are largely based upon expert opinion since
randomized controlled trials in DLB are few. Substantial progress has been made since the
previous report in the detection and recognition of DLB as a common and important clinical
disorder. During that period it has been incorporated into DSM-5, as major neurocognitive
disorder with Lewy bodies. There remains a pressing need to understand the underlying neu-
robiology and pathophysiology of DLB, to develop and deliver clinical trials with both symp-
tomatic and disease-modifying agents, and to help patients and carers worldwide to inform
themselves about the disease, its prognosis, best available treatments, ongoing research, and
how to get adequate support. Neurology® 2017;89:88–100

The Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) Consortium last reported on diagnosis and manage-
ment in December 2005, and its recommendations have been widely cited for both clinical
and research use.1,2 Changes made to the diagnostic criteria at that time increased diagnostic
sensitivity for DLB,e1 but detection rates in clinical practice remain suboptimal,3 with many
cases missed or misdiagnosed, usually as Alzheimer disease (AD). The revised DLB criteria
presented here incorporate new developments since then and result from a review process that
combined the reports of 4 multidisciplinary, expert working groups with a meeting that
included patient and care partner participation (appendix e-1 at Neurology.org). The Consor-
tium recognizes increasing interest in detecting early-stage disease; prodromal DLB criteria are in
development and will be reported separately.
SUMMARY OF CHANGES While maintaining their previous structure, the revised DLB clinical diagnostic
criteria improve on earlier versions1,2 by distinguishing clearly between clinical features and diagnostic

 biomarkers, with guidance about optimal methods to
establish and interpret these. Clinical signs and symp-
toms are weighted as core or supportive, and bio-
markers as indicative or supportive, based upon
their diagnostic specificity and the volume of good-
quality evidence available. Although carrying less
diagnostic weight, supportive items are often valuable
in clinical decision-making, acting as signposts to or
adding evidence for a DLB diagnosis. The previous
category of suggestive features is no longer used and
those items, namely REM sleep behavior disorder
(RBD), severe neuroleptic sensitivity, and low dopa-
mine transporter (DAT) imaging, have been reas-
signed in the new scheme.
The revised criteria (table 1) generate categories
of probable and possible DLB, corresponding to
terminology previously used, describing the clinical
presentations most typical of dementia associated
with underlying Lewy-related pathology. Because
of considerable pathologic heterogeneity, some
dementia presentations associated with Lewy-related
pathology are atypical, e.g., if abundant neocortical
neuritic plaques and tangles are present in addition
to Lewy bodies (LB), the clinical profile may more
closely resemble AD rather than DLB.4,5 Such mixed
pathology cases are common, explaining why up to
half of carefully research-diagnosed patients with
AD may have unsuspected Lewy-related pathology
at autopsy.6 Criteria for the detection of such pa-
tients, previously characterized as the LB variant of
AD,7 remain to be formulated.
Clinical features. Dementia, defined as a progressive
cognitive decline of sufficient magnitude to interfere
with normal social or occupational functions, or with
usual daily activities, is an essential requirement for
DLB diagnosis.
Although dementia screens such as the Mini-
Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal
Cognitive Assessment are useful to characterize global
impairment in DLB, neuropsychological assessment
should include tests covering the full range of cogni-
tive domains potentially affected. Disproportionate
attentional, executive function, and visual processing
deficits relative to memory and naming are typical.8,9,
e2,e3 Measures of attention/executive function that dif-
ferentiate DLB from AD and normal aging and that
predict progression from mild cognitive impairment
(MCI) to DLB include tests of processing speed and
divided/alternating attention, e.g., Stroop tasks, trail-
making tasks, phonemic fluency, and computerized
tasks of reaction time. The spatial and perceptual
difficulties of DLB often occur early; examples of
useful probes include tasks of figure copy, e.g., inter-
secting pentagons, complex figure copy; visual assem-
bly, e.g., block design, puzzle tasks; spatial matching,
e.g., line orientation, size matching tasks; and percep-
tual discrimination, e.g., incomplete figures, incom-
plete letters, pareidolia tasks.10,e4
Memory and object naming tend to be less
affected in DLB, and are best evaluated through story
recall, verbal list learning, and confrontation naming
tasks, although some patients’ difficulties may be sec-
ondary to speed or retrieval task demands.
No DLB-specific assessment batteries have been
developed, although recommendations have been
made about suitable existing instruments11 and a com-
posite risk score tool has been published.12
Core clinical features. Fluctuation. DLB fluctuations
have been described in detail previously1,2 and are
typically delirium-like,e5 occurring as spontaneous al-
terations in cognition, attention, and arousal. They
include waxing and waning episodes of behavioral
inconsistency, incoherent speech, variable attention,
or altered consciousness that involves staring or zon-
ing out. Direct questioning of an informant about
fluctuations may not reliably discriminate DLB from
AD, but questions about daytime drowsiness, leth-
argy, staring into space, or episodes of disorganized
speech do. These have been incorporated into scales
that either score the severity and frequency of
fluctuations derived from a clinical interview or use
informant
reports
from
semi-structured
ques-
tionnaires.13–16 Recording variations in attentional
performance using repeated computer-based tests
offers an independent method.e6 At least one measure
of fluctuation should be documented when applying
DLB diagnostic criteria. Fluctuations may also occur
in advanced stages of other dementias, so they best
predict DLB when they are present early.e7
Visual hallucinations. Recurrent, complex visual hallu-
cinations occur in up to 80% of patients with DLB
and are a frequent clinical signpost to diagnosis. They
are typically well-formed, featuring people, children,
or animals, sometimes accompanied by related phe-
nomena including passage hallucinations, sense of
presence, and visual illusions.e8 Patients are typically
able to report these experiences, as are observant
caregivers. Patient responses to their hallucinations
vary both in degree of insight and emotional reaction
to them. Assessment scales for characterizing and
quantifying visual hallucinations are available.17
Parkinsonism. Spontaneous parkinsonian features,
not due to antidopaminergic medications or stroke,
are common in DLB, eventually occurring in over
85%.e9 Parkinsonism in Parkinson disease (PD) is
defined as bradykinesia in combination with rest
tremor, rigidity, or both.18 Many DLB patients’ par-
kinsonism falls short of this, so documentation of
only one of these cardinal features is required. Care
should be taken particularly in older patients not to
misinterpret physical signs due to comorbidity, e.g.,

 arthritis, or inability to comply with neurologic exam-
ination because of cognitive impairment. If parkin-
sonism is clinically equivocal, a DAT uptake scan
may be helpful.
REM sleep behavior disorder. RBD is a parasomnia man-
ifested by recurrent dream enactment behavior that
includes movements mimicking dream content and
associated with an absence of normal REM sleep ato-
nia. It is particularly likely if dreams involve a chasing
or attacking theme, and if the patient or bed partner
has sustained injuries from limb movements.19–22,e10
RBD is now included as a core clinical feature because
it occurs frequently in autopsy-confirmed cases
compared with non-DLB (76% vs 4%).19 It often
begins many years before other symptoms, may
become less vigorous or even quiescent over time, and
should be screened for using a scale that allows for
patient or bed partner report.23,24 Conditions mim-
icking RBD are common in people with dementia, e.
g., confusional awakenings, severe obstructive sleep
apnea, and periodic limb movements, all of which
must be excluded by careful supplementary ques-
tioning to avoid a false-positive diagnosis. If there is
any doubt whether a sleep disturbance is due to RBD,
referral to a specialist sleep clinic should be made, or
polysomnography (PSG) requested.
Supportive clinical features. These are clinical fea-
tures that are commonly present, sometimes early.
Although lacking diagnostic specificity, such symp-
toms may indicate DLB in a patient with dementia,
particularly when they persist over time or if several
occur in combination. New to this list is hypersom-
nia,14 usually presenting as excessive daytime sleep-
iness. Also new is hyposmia, which occurs earlier in
DLB than in AD.25 Transient episodes of unrespon-
siveness may represent an extreme form of cognitive
fluctuation, difficult to distinguish from true syn-
cope. Severe antipsychotic sensitivity is now listed
as supportive, because reduced prescribing of D2
receptor blocking antipsychotics in DLB limits its
diagnostic usefulness.e11 Caution about their use re-
mains unchanged.
Biomarkers. Although direct biomarker evidence of
LB-related pathology is not yet available for clinical
diagnosis, several useful indirect methods are.
Indicative biomarkers. If one or more of these is
found, associated with one or more core clinical fea-
tures, probable DLB should be diagnosed. Dementia
without any core clinical features, but with one or
more indicative biomarkers, may be classified as pos-
sible DLB. Probable DLB should not be diagnosed
on the basis of biomarkers alone.
Reduced DAT uptake in basal ganglia demonstrated by SPECT
or PET imaging. The utility of DAT imaging in distin-
guishing DLB from AD is well-established, with
sensitivity (78%) and specificity (90%).26 Figure 1
shows 123iodine FP-CIT SPECT images in patients
with AD, patients with DLB, and normal controls.
When parkinsonism is the only core clinical feature
of DLB in a patient with dementia, reduced DAT
uptake warrants a probable DLB diagnosis pro-
vided that other disorders associated with cognitive
impairment and reduced DAT uptake can be
excluded,
e.g.,
progressive
supranuclear
palsy,
multisystem atrophy, corticobasal degeneration,
and
frontotemporal
dementia.

Table 1
Revised1,2 criteria for the clinical diagnosis of probable and possible
dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)
Essential for a diagnosis of DLB is dementia, defined as a progressive cognitive decline of
sufficient magnitude to interfere with normal social or occupational functions, or with usual daily
activities. Prominent or persistent memory impairment may not necessarily occur in the early
stages but is usually evident with progression. Deficits on tests of attention, executive function,
and visuoperceptual ability may be especially prominent and occur early.
Core clinical features (The first 3 typically occur early and may persist throughout the course.)
Fluctuating cognition with pronounced variations in attention and alertness.
Recurrent visual hallucinations that are typically well formed and detailed.
REM sleep behavior disorder, which may precede cognitive decline.
One or more spontaneous cardinal features of parkinsonism: these are bradykinesia (defined as
slowness of movement and decrement in amplitude or speed), rest tremor, or rigidity.
Supportive clinical features
Severe sensitivity to antipsychotic agents; postural instability; repeated falls; syncope or other
transient episodes of unresponsiveness; severe autonomic dysfunction, e.g., constipation,
orthostatic hypotension, urinary incontinence; hypersomnia; hyposmia; hallucinations in other
modalities; systematized delusions; apathy, anxiety, and depression.
Indicative biomarkers
Reduced dopamine transporter uptake in basal ganglia demonstrated by SPECT or PET.
Abnormal (low uptake) 123iodine-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy.
Polysomnographic confirmation of REM sleep without atonia.
Supportive biomarkers
Relative preservation of medial temporal lobe structures on CT/MRI scan.
Generalized low uptake on SPECT/PET perfusion/metabolism scan with reduced occipital
activity 6 the cingulate island sign on FDG-PET imaging.
Prominent posterior slow-wave activity on EEG with periodic fluctuations in the pre-alpha/
theta range.
Probable DLB can be diagnosed if:
a. Two or more core clinical features of DLB are present, with or without the presence of
indicative biomarkers, or
b. Only one core clinical feature is present, but with one or more indicative biomarkers.
Probable DLB should not be diagnosed on the basis of biomarkers alone.
Possible DLB can be diagnosed if:
a. Only one core clinical feature of DLB is present, with no indicative biomarker evidence, or
b. One or more indicative biomarkers is present but there are no core clinical features.
DLB is less likely:
a. In the presence of any other physical illness or brain disorder including cerebrovascular
disease, sufficient to account in part or in total for the clinical picture, although these do not
exclude a DLB diagnosis and may serve to indicate mixed or multiple pathologies contributing
to the clinical presentation, or
b. If parkinsonian features are the only core clinical feature and appear for the first time at
a stage of severe dementia.
DLB should be diagnosed when dementia occurs before or concurrently with parkinsonism. The
term Parkinson disease dementia (PDD) should be used to describe dementia that occurs in the
context of well-established Parkinson disease. In a practice setting the term that is most
appropriate to the clinical situation should be used and generic terms such as Lewy body disease
are often helpful. In research studies in which distinction needs to be made between DLB and
PDD, the existing 1-year rule between the onset of dementia and parkinsonism continues to be
recommended.

and limited nigral neuron loss27 or a balanced loss

from patients with AD, DLB, and age-matched nor-
mal controls are shown in figure 2. Useful sensitivity
(69%) and specificity (87%) values for discriminating
probable DLB from probable AD rise to 77% and
94% in milder cases (MMSE .21).28 Studies have
generally excluded patients with comorbidities, or
taking medicines, which can produce abnormal
MIBG images. Clinicians should carefully interpret
MIBG results in the light of possible confounding
causes, including ischemic heart disease, heart failure,
diabetes mellitus, peripheral neuropathies, and med-
ications that may cause reduced uptake including
labetalol, reserpine, tricyclic antidepressants, and
over-the-counter sympathomimetics.29,e14,e15
PSG confirmation of REM sleep without atonia. PSG dem-
onstration of REM sleep without atoniae16,e17 is
desirable whenever feasible, since it is a highly
specific predictor of Lewy-related pathology. If
the PSG shows REM sleep without atonia in
a person with dementia and a history of RBD,
there is a $90% likelihood of a synucleinopathy,22
sufficient to justify a probable DLB diagnosis even
in the absence of any other core feature or bio-
marker (figure 3).
Supportive biomarkers. These are biomarkers consis-
tent with DLB that help the diagnostic evaluation,
but without clear diagnostic specificity.
Relative preservation of medial temporal lobe structures on CT/
MRI scan. Patients with AD show greater atrophy of
medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures than patients
with DLB (figure 1), particularly the hippocampus,
which is strongly correlated at autopsy with tangle
rather
than
plaque
or
LB-related
pathology.30
Absent or minimal MTL atrophy is therefore con-
sistent with DLB, but unusual in AD. A multisite
study with autopsy confirmation found sensitivity
(64%) and specificity (68%) for separating AD from
DLB.31 MTL atrophy in DLB may, however, signal
substantial additional AD neuropathologic change,
and predict a more rapid clinical course.32
Generalized low uptake on SPECT/PET perfusion/metabolism
scan, reduced occipital activity, and the posterior cingulate island
sign on FDG-PET imaging. FDG-PET occipital hypome-
tabolism correlates with visual cortex neuropathology
in DLB33 and a small, autopsy-confirmed study
suggested this could distinguish DLB from AD with

 high accuracy.34 Larger studies, earlier in disease,
suggest sensitivity (70%) and specificity (74%)
slightly lower than needed for an indicative bio-
marker, although better than that reported for
HMPAO-SPECT (65% and 64%).35,36 Relative
preservation of posterior or midcingulate metabolism
on FDG-PET (the cingulate island sign) has been
described in DLB,37 associated with less concurrent
neurofibrillary pathology, but with no difference in
Ab load relative to AD (figure 4).38
Prominent posterior slow-wave EEG activity with periodic
fluctuations in the pre-alpha/theta range. Evidence is building
to support quantitative EEG as a DLB biomarker,
characterized by specific abnormalities in posterior
derivations. These include a pre-alpha-dominant fre-
quency, either stable or intermixed with alpha/theta/
delta activities in pseudoperiodic patterns,39 which
together have a predictive value .90% for the diag-
nosis of DLB compared with AD.e18 These specific
EEG patterns also correlate positively with the severity
of clinically observed cognitive fluctuationse6 and may
be seen at the MCI stage.e19
Other
imaging
biomarkers. PET imaging shows
increased Ab brain deposition in .50% of patients
with DLB, limiting its value to distinguish between
AD
and
DLB.40
Combining
biomarkers
in
a multimodal approach can improve diagnostic accu-
racy in distinguishing DLB and AD41 and provides
information about mixed pathology and multisystem
involvement. Tau PET imaging may have an impor-
tant role, along with MTL atrophy, as a key indicator
of coexisting AD pathology in DLB, predictive of
clinical phenotype and progression.
Genetic and fluid biomarkers. The development of
broadly applicable CSF, blood, peripheral tissue,
or genotypic biomarkers for DLB remains elusive.
Although it is clear that there is a substantial genetic
contribution to DLB42,43 and that different genetic
markers even within the a-synuclein gene (SNCA)
may be associated with different LB syndromes,44
our understanding of the core genes involved re-
mains limited. CSF a-synuclein is not yet proven
as a biomarker, while Ab, tau, and phospho-tau
measurements may be more useful in determining
concomitant AD pathology or predicting cognitive
decline.e20 Glucocerebrosidase (GBA) mutations are
overrepresented in DLBe21 but most individuals
with DLB do not have them. It is premature to
recommend genetic testing in a clinical setting,
either for confirmation of diagnosis or for prediction
of disease, and genetic studies should currently be
limited to research settings.

 Clinical management. The management of patients
with DLB is complex, requiring a multifaceted
approach. Key elements include a thorough initial eval-
uation to ensure accurate diagnosis; early identification
of signs and symptoms requiring intervention;
engagement, education, and support of care pro-
viders; and a multidisciplinary team approach. Pa-
tients with DLB are prone to mental status
worsening, including delirium, in the face of comor-
bid medical disorders. Dopaminergic therapies and
anticholinergic medications can adversely affect cog-
nition and behavior, leading to confusion and psy-
chosis.e22,e23 Treatment of DLB is focused on the
cognitive, psychiatric, motor, and other nonmotor
symptoms that represent the core or most common
features of the disorder.45 A combination of phar-
macologic and nonpharmacologic approaches is
optimal. As the evidence base to support particular
treatments remains limited, the recommendations
outlined below remain based, in part, upon consen-
sus expert opinion.
Nonpharmacologic interventions. Given both the lim-
ited evidence for efficacy and the potential increased
morbidity and mortality risks associated with pharma-
cologic treatments in DLB, there is a need to develop
and test nonpharmacologic management strategies.
Interventions can be patient- or caregiver-focused, or
both. More research in this area has been conducted in
AD and PD than in DLB, with promising preliminary
evidence for exercise (both motor and cognitive ben-
efits),46 cognitive training,e24 and caregiver-oriented
education and training to manage psychiatric symp-
toms including agitation and psychosis.e25,e26
Pharmacologic management. Cognitive symptoms. Meta-
analyses of Class I clinical trials of rivastigmine
and donepezil support the use of cholinesterase in-
hibitors (CHEIs) in DLB for improving cognition,
global function, and activities of living, with evi-
dence that even if patients do not improve with
CHEIs they are less likely to deteriorate while
taking them.47,48 The efficacy of memantine in
DLB is less clear, but it is well-tolerated and may
have benefits, either as monotherapy or adjunctive
to a CHEI.47,48

 hallucinations and delusions in DLB.49 Since anxiety
and agitation are sometimes driven by psychosis,
there may be secondary benefits in these. The use
of antipsychotics for the acute management of sub-
stantial behavioral disturbance, delusions, or visual
hallucinations comes with attendant mortality risks
in patients with dementia, and particularly in the case
of DLB they should be avoided whenever possible,
given the increased risk of a serious sensitivity reac-
tion.50 Low-dose quetiapine may be relatively
safere27 than other antipsychotics and is widely used,
but a small placebo-controlled clinical trial in DLB
was negative.51 There is a positive evidence base for
clozapine in PD psychosis, but efficacy and tolera-
bility in DLB have not been established. Newer
drugs targeting the serotonergic system, such as pi-
mavanserin,52 may be alternatives, but controlled
clinical trial data in DLB are needed. Although
depressive symptoms are common in DLB, trial data
are scant. In alignment with general advice on
depression in dementia, selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake in-
hibitors, and mirtazapine are options in DLB with
treatment guided by individual patient tolerability
and response.
Motor symptoms. Parkinsonism is often less responsive
to dopaminergic treatments in DLB than in PD and
their use may be associated with an increased risk of
psychosis, although some patients may benefit from
levodopa preparations introduced at low doses and
increased
slowly
to
the
minimum
required
to minimize motor disability without exacerbating psy-
chiatric symptoms.53,e28 Patients at risk of falling may
benefit from safety assessments, as well as bone mineral
density screening, and assessment of vitamin D status,
to manage risk of traumatic fractures.
Other symptoms. A wide range of other symptoms can
occur in DLB, including autonomic and sleep/wake-
fulness disturbances, which have profound negative
sequelae for quality of life in both patients and their
families. In the absence of DLB-specific trial data
for these symptoms, clinicians base their treatment
decisions on clinical experience, expert opinion, or
evidence-based recommendations developed in other
diseases, e.g., cautious bedtime use of clonazepam
may reduce the risk of sleep-related injuries in

Occipital lobe metabolism is preserved in AD and NC but reduced (blue arrows) in DLB. Hypometabolism in AD is predom-
inantly in the temporal, parietal, and frontal regions. There is normal metabolism as reflected by the normal 18F-FDG
uptake (lighter shade of gray) in the posterior cingulate region (yellow arrowhead) surrounded by reduced 18F-FDG
uptake (darker gray) in the adjacent occipital cortex in DLB, representing the cingulate island sign. This contrasts with
the relatively reduced 18F-FDG uptake in the posterior cingulate and relatively preserved 18F-FDG uptake in the occipital
cortex regions in AD. In the control, there is normal 18F-FDG uptake in the posterior cingulate, occipital, and other

worsening cognition and gait impairment, melatonin
being a possibly safer option.54
Pathology. Pathologic assessment and diagnostic criteria for
DLB. The previously published methods for patho-
logic assessment and diagnosis of DLB should con-
tinue to be used with only a few modifications,
shown in table 2, which predicts the likelihood that
the pathologic findings will be associated with a typi-
cal DLB clinical syndrome, i.e., cases with high likeli-
hood are expected to fulfil clinical criteria for
probable DLB, whereas low likelihood cases may have
few or no DLB clinical features.
Table 2 assigns categories of AD neuropatho-
logic change according to National Institute on
Aging–Alzheimer’s Association criteria (no, low,
intermediate, and high),55 and adds previously
omitted
categories
of
Lewy-related
pathology
including olfactory bulb only56 and amygdala pre-
dominant.57,58 Both of these are considered to be
low-likelihood DLB but may in the future be use-
ful in assessing prodromal disease. Further efforts
are required to develop better interrater reliabil-
ity59 for Lewy-related disease subtypes (olfactory
bulb only, amygdala predominant, brainstem, lim-
bic [transitional], and diffuse neocortical). Table 2
also includes an assessment of substantia nigra
neuronal loss (none, mild, moderate, and severe)
in order to subclassify cases into those likely or not
to have parkinsonism (DLB-P and DLB-no P).60
FUTURE DIRECTIONS. Since publication of the 2005
consensus report, DLB has been confirmed as a major
dementia subtype, categorized in DSM-5e29 as neuro-
cognitive disorder with LB, and distinguished from neu-
rocognitive disorder due to PD. The consensus group
remains supportive of the 1-year rule distinguishing
DLB from PD dementia, because as originally stated1,2
this arbitrary cutoff remains useful, particularly in clinical
practice. Based as it is on expert opinion, the time period
may need modification when the genetic underpinnings,
pathophysiologic mechanisms, and prodromal states of
these disorders are sufficiently understood to enable
a data-driven solution.e30,e31
There is an urgent need to develop guidelines and
outcome measures for clinical trials in DLB, both
symptomatic and disease-modifying, nonpharmaco-
logic and pharmacologic. DLB researchers can build
upon experience gained in AD and PD; additional is-
sues for them to consider include subtyping of pa-
tients on the basis of clinical or biomarker criteria
and selecting target symptoms and outcome measures
appropriate to DLB. It will be necessary to manage
potential confounding factors that are common in
DLB, e.g., fluctuations in alertness and fatigue, active
hallucinations, and concomitant use of cognitive
enhancing and psychiatric medications. Such consid-
erations will need to be applied when designing clin-
ical trials across the spectrum of clinical syndrome of
DLB from prodromal and presymptomatic stages,
still to be identified, to overt dementia.
Suggested strategies to progress critical areas of
biological research include collecting samples from
large population-based cohorts and developing a pub-
licly available DLB genetic database and a repository
for DLB exome data. Family studies are needed to
find and confirm genes, requiring clinicians to take
detailed family histories seeking evidence not only
of DLB, PD, and AD and other dementias, but also
of RBD and supportive features.
In order to make progress in deciphering biologi-
cal mechanisms at play in DLB including GBAe32 and
inflammatory pathways,e33 it will be necessary to
develop robust animal models that capture the true
neuropathologic and behavioral abnormalities of
DLB,
and
to
identify
possible
disease-specific

 molecular differences in a-synuclein, tau, and Ab
among DLB, PD, PD dementia, and AD. The latter
includes characterization of possible molecular strains
of misfolded or pathologic a-synuclein, posttransla-
tional modifications in degradation and clearance
processes, and transmission and propagation. It will
be increasingly important to study protein interac-
tions among a-synuclein, Ab, and tau.e34 Finally,
there is an unmet need to characterize biological ef-
fects of identified genetic risk factors, including
APOE, GBA, and SNCA, as well as to model and
analyze gene–environmental interactions.
In order to best advance DLB research, global
harmonization efforts are required to create networks
of researchers and research participants who share
common platforms for data and biomarker collec-
tion, outcome measures for clinical–translational
research, and shared terminology across language,
cultures, and traditions. Consideration might be
given to creating an international patient and care-
giver association to serve as advocates for private and
public funding; identifying obstacles to the phar-
maceutical
industry
sponsoring
DLB
research;
bridging relationships with the PD and AD world
research communities; creating a plan for reim-
bursement for DLB clinical care, drugs/devices, and
biomarkers; and increasing interdisciplinary and
interprofessional
communication
regarding
the
challenges facing clinicians, patients, and caregivers.
Finally, priority needs to be given to helping patients
and carers to inform themselves about the disease, its
prognosis,
best
available
treatments,
ongoing
research, and how to get adequate support.
