Abstract
Summary This systematic review summarizes the effect of
combined exercise and nutrition intervention on muscle mass
and muscle function. A total of 37 RCTs were identified.
Results indicate that physical exercise has a positive impact
on muscle mass and muscle function in subjects aged 65 years
and older. However, any interactive effect of dietary supple-
mentation appears to be limited.
Introduction In 2013, Denison et al. conducted a system-
atic review including 17 randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) to explore the effect of combined exercise and
nutrition intervention to improve muscle mass, muscle
strength, or physical performance in older people.
They concluded that further studies were needed to pro-
vide evidence upon which public health and clinical
recommendations could be based. The purpose of the
present work was to update the prior systematic review
and include studies published up to October 2015.
Methods Using the electronic databases MEDLINE and
EMBASE, we identified RCTs which assessed the combined
effect of exercise training and nutritional supplementation on
muscle strength, muscle mass, or physical performance in
subjects aged 60 years and over. Study selection and data
extraction were performed by two independent reviewers.
Results The search strategy identified 21 additional RCTs giv-
ing a total of 37 RCTs. Studies were heterogeneous in terms of
protocols for physical exercise and dietary supplementation
(proteins, essential amino acids, creatine, β-hydroxy-β-

 methylbuthyrate, vitamin D, multi-nutrients, or other). In 79%
of the studies (27/34 RCTs), muscle mass increased with ex-
ercise but an additional effect of nutrition was only found in 8
RCTs (23.5%). Muscle strength increased in 82.8% of the
studies (29/35 RCTs) following exercise intervention, and di-
etary supplementation showed additional benefits in only a
small number of studies (8/35 RCTS, 22.8%). Finally, the
majority of studies showed an increase of physical perfor-
mance following exercise intervention (26/28 RCTs, 92.8%)
but interaction with nutrition supplementation was only found
in 14.3% of these studies (4/28 RCTs).
Conclusion Physical exercise has a positive impact on muscle
mass and muscle function in healthy subjects aged 60 years
and older. The biggest effect of exercise intervention, of any
type, has been seen on physical performance (gait speed, chair
rising test, balance, SPPB test, etc.). We observed huge vari-
ations in regard to the dietary supplementation protocols.
Based on the included studies, mainly performed on well-
nourished subjects, the interactive effect of dietary supple-
mentation on muscle function appears limited.

Sarcopenia
Introduction
Sarcopenia has been defined by the European Working Group
on Sarcopenia in Older People as a progressive and general loss
of muscle mass and muscle function (defined either by a low
muscle strength or a low physical performance) with advancing
age [1]. Even though the loss of both is a natural part of the
aging process, sarcopenia is defined when muscle mass and
function falls below defined thresholds. Diagnosis of sarcopenia
requires, therefore, the measurement of muscle mass, muscle
strength, and physical performance [2]. Sarcopenia is recog-
nized as a major public health problem [3, 4] due to significant
clinical, economic, and social consequences. The implementa-
tion of preventive and therapeutic interventions has become a
challenge due to the growing number of older persons affected
by sarcopenia and its disabling complications.
Physical activity and nutritional supplementation have
been investigated in several interventional studies. Recently,
Cruz-Jentoft et al. [5] published a systematic review summa-
rizing studies assessing the effect of physical activity and/or
dietary supplementation on sarcopenia. Results indicated that
most exercise trials showed an improvement of muscle
strength and physical performance with physical activity, pre-
dominantly resistance training interventions. Results were
consistent regarding the effect of dietary supplementation on
muscle mass. Some studies have suggested a role of proteins,
β-hydroxy β-methylbutyric acid, or amino acid on muscle
function. However, the effects of these exercise and dietary
interventions were assessed separately in this particular re-
view; little is known about the combined effects of these two
interventions. For this reason, Denison et al. [6] conducted a
systematic review in 2013 to determine the effect of combined
exercise and nutrition interventions on muscle mass, strength,
and function in older people. That systematic review com-
prised 17 studies involving older (≥ 65 years) adults published
up to April 2013. The authors concluded that further studies
were required to provide adequate evidence on which to base
public health and clinical recommendations. The purpose of
the present work was to provide an update to that systematic
review by including studies published up to October 2015,
and to focus on whether additional benefits arose if dietary
supplementation was combined with exercise training.
Methods
Literature search
The literature search was performed in accordance with the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
analysis (PRISMA) statement. Using MEDLINE/Ovid and
EMBASE/Ovid, we identified randomized controlled studies
(RCTs) which assessed the combined effect of exercise training
and nutritional supplementation on muscle strength, muscle
mass, or physical performance. We updated the paper by
Denison et al. [6] which limited the search strategy to
February 2013. Therefore, we searched for any additional stud-
ies published between April 2013 and October 2015. The search
strategy and search terms that were used for this research are
detailed in Table 1. Additional studies were identified by a man-
ual search of bibliographic references of relevant articles and
existing reviews. Conference abstracts were not included.
Study selection
In the initial screening stage, two investigators independently
reviewed the title and abstract for each of these references to
exclude articles irrelevant to the systematic review. Rigorous
inclusion criteria were adhered to (Table 2). In the second step,
the two investigators independently read full texts of the arti-
cles not excluded in the initial stage, then selected the studies
meeting the inclusion criteria (Table 2). All differences of
opinion regarding selection of articles were resolved through
discussion and consensus.
In order to maintain consistency between this update and
the previous systematic review, the same inclusion criteria
were used [6]. No age restriction was included in the search
strategy but this review focused only on subjects aged 60 years
and older. Studies performed on children, adolescents, and
young adults were therefore excluded. Studies in which the
nutritional intervention was energy restriction to promote
1818

 weight loss were also excluded. Finally, studies were also
excluded if they included populations with a specific health
condition (e.g., cirrhosis, cancer, diabetes, chronic kidney dis-
ease, etc.).
Data extraction
Data were extracted according to a standardized form to in-
clude authors, journal name, year of publication, country, ob-
jective of the study, length of intervention, type of population,
gender ratio, mean age, age range, detailed groups with sam-
ple size, adherence to the treatment, % of participants who
completed the study, adverse events, protocol of exercise in-
tervention, protocol of nutritional intervention, muscle mass
outcomes, muscle strength outcomes, and physical perfor-
mance outcomes.
Methodology quality assessment
The quality of each study was independently assessed by two
authors using the Jadad Score [7] system. The Jadad score

 ranges from 0 to 5 points. Studies were considered to be of
excellent quality if the score was 5, good quality if the score
was 3 or 4, and poor quality if otherwise.
Presentation of results
The findings were evaluated in a descriptive manner based on
the information provided by each of the included studies.
Because of the huge heterogeneity observed in the protocols
of exercise and dietary supplementation, no meta-analysis was
undertaken.
Results
Included studies
A total of 993 references were identified through the database
search. A manual search of the bibliography of 10 relevant
systematic reviews and meta-analyses did not generate any
further studies for inclusion. After reading all titles and ab-
stracts, 36 RCTs were selected for full-text review, following
which 21 were included in this systematic review update.
These 21 studies, added to the previous 17 considered by
Denison et al. [6], gave a total of 37 RCTs included in the
current systematic review (Fig. 1).
Characteristics of the studies are shown in Table 3. Twelve
studies were performed in Europe, 11 in the USA/Canada, 7 in
Asia, 4 in South America, and 3 in Australia. The number of
participants ranged from 17 [35] to 222 [26] and study dura-
tion ranged from 4 weeks [27] to 18 months [42, 43]. The
majority of studies included both male and female participants
but 10 studies were confined to women only and 5 included
only men. The mean age of participants varied from
59.5 ± 4.5 years [9, 10] to 87.1 ± 0.6 years [39, 40]. Twelve
RCTs were graded on the Jadad Scale as having an excellent
quality, 15 a good quality, and 10 a poor quality.
Twenty-two studies used a two-group comparison method-
ology: one group receiving exercise + nutrition and the other
group receiving exercise only (with placebo or no interven-
tion). Eleven other studies used a four-group comparison
model with one control group with no intervention, one group
with exercise only, one group with nutrition only and finally,
one group with combined exercise and nutrition interventions.
Three other studies chose to randomize their population into
three groups comprising a control group with no intervention,
a group with exercise only, and a group with exercise com-
bined with nutrition. Finally, one study used a five-group com-
parison model that included two groups with exercise and
nutrition interventions, but used a different nutritional supple-
ment in each of these two groups. For this systematic review,
we used only results from two groups, one receiving exercise +
nutrition and one receiving exercise only. It has to be noted
that only half of the studies were double blinded.
Regarding nutritional interventions, 10 of the 37 studies
used proteins. One further study used protein combined with
essential amino acids, a second used protein combined with
vitamin D, and a third used protein combined with creatine.
Three studies used essential amino acids alone, five studies
used creatine alone, three studies used β-hydroxy-β-
methylbutyrate alone, and two used vitamin D alone. Of the
remaining 12 studies, five used multi-nutrient supplements
and six used other products (vitamin and mineral-enhanced
dairy and fruit products, green tea, magnesium oxide, milk
fat globule membrane, soy isoflavones, and tea catechin).
For exercise, the majority of studies used resistance training
with the remainder using multicomponent training involving
both resistance and additional exercises such as walking, fit-
ness, aerobics, balance, etc.
Types of nutritional intervention
Results of the interventions are summarized in Table 4.

 Protein supplementation
Thirteen individual studies assessed the impact of a combined
protein supplement and exercise intervention on the muscle
function of elderly people. Most of these studies were of good
quality but four were of poor quality [12, 24, 26, 29]. In
three of the 13 studies, protein was combined with creatine
[12], essential amino acids [24], or vitamin D [26].
Supplementation protocols were heterogeneous in terms of
studied population, duration of study, and supplementation
dose, which varied from 7.4 to 45 g of protein per day.
Twelve studies assessed the effect of the interventions on mus-
cle mass and/or muscle strength but only nine reported results
on physical performance.
Muscle mass: Muscle mass increased significantly with
exercise in 11 of the 12 included RCTs. An interactive effect
of protein supplementation and exercise was reported in only
three of these studies: one looked at frail individuals [33], a
second has been performed in elderly sarcopenic men [25],
and the third enrolled female retirement village residents
whose protein supplementation was lean red meat [22]. One
other study [8] reported an increase of fat-free mass and ap-
pendicular lean mass only in the group supplemented with
protein and exercise but the difference between the groups
was not described. Muscle strength: All studies showed a sig-
nificant improvement of leg muscle strength with exercise. No
additional effect of protein was seen in the majority of these
studies with the exception of three studies, each one of excel-
lent quality: Daly et al. [22] showed significant improvement
in leg extension in the group receiving lean red meat (45 g of
protein/day) and exercise compared to an exercise-only group
and Chalé et al. [17], who showed greater improvement in
knee extensor peak power after a supplementation of 40 g of
protein/day and, finally, Zdzieblik et al. [25] reported that
quadriceps strength of the right leg (effect on the left leg was
not assessed) increased more in the group taking 15 g of col-
lagen peptide as supplement/day. Improvement in handgrip
strength was seen in one study [33] but was absent in three
others [20, 24, 29]. Finally, one study [8] reported an increase
of the 1 repetition maximum (1RM) knee extensors only in the
group with protein combined with exercise; however, the dif-
ference between the two groups was not reported. Physical
performance: All studies showed a significant improvement
of at least one physical performance test with exercise. No
studies showed a significant difference between the groups
receiving exercise only compared to the group receiving ex-
ercise combined with protein.
Summary: Muscle mass increased with exercises in 11/12
RCTs but an additional effect of protein was found in only 3/
12 RCTs; Muscle strength increased with exercises in 12/12
RCTs but an additional effect of protein was found in only 3/
12 RCTs; Physical performance increased with exercise, for at
least one outcome, in 9/9 RCTs with no additional effect of
protein.
Essential amino acids supplementation
Three studies used essential amino acids (EAA) supplemen-
tation, 6 g/day for 3 months in sarcopenic community-
dwelling older women [36], 10 g/day for 4 weeks in older
adults recruited from nursing homes and adult day-care
centers [27], and 12 g/day for 12 weeks in older men
[35]. One study was of poor quality [35]. All three assessed
the effect of intervention on muscle mass and muscle
strength and two also measured the effect on physical per-
formance [27, 36].
Muscle mass: Two studies reported an increase of muscle
mass with exercise but did not report any difference between
the group receiving EAA supplements and the group who did
not [35, 36]. The third study did not report any increase of
muscle mass, neither for subjects receiving exercises only, nor
in the groups of subjects receiving a combination of exercise
and EAA supplements [27]. Muscle strength: Knee extension
increased with exercise in two studies but no interaction was
found with EAA supplementation. In the third study, no effect
on isometric leg strength was observed [27]. Physical
performance: Walking speed [36] and timed up and go [27]
tests improved with exercise with no additional effect of EAA
supplements. Standing balance and chair-stand test did not
improve with treatment [27].
Summary: Muscle mass and muscle strength increased
with exercise in 2/3 RCTs with no additional effect of EAA;
Physical performance (walking speed and SPPB test only)
increased with exercise in 2/2 RCTs with no additional effect
of EAA.
β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB) supplementation
Three studies of good quality used Ca-HMB [13, 16, 37] as
a dietary supplement. In all studies, the treated group re-
ceived 3 g of Ca-HMB per day. The study duration varied:
24 weeks [13], 12 weeks [37], and 8 weeks [16].
Participants were healthy ambulatory older adults in the
first two studies [13, 37] and healthy adults confined to
complete bed rest for 10 days for the latter [16]. All studies
assessed the effect on muscle mass and muscle strength but
only two assessed the effect of treatment on physical per-
formance [13, 16].
Muscle mass: Effects of Ca-HMB supplementation on mus-
cle mass were not consistent across the three studies. Fat-free
mass significantly increased with exercise in one study but no
difference was evident between the group with combined exer-
cise + Ca-HMB and the group with exercise only [13].
Moreover, a significantly greater increase in fat-free mass was

 found in men from the placebo group. One study did not show
any effect of the treatment on fat-free mass but did show an
increase in thigh muscle area with exercise; no inter-group dif-
ference was seen [37]. Finally, the third study showed a signif-
icantly greater effect of exercise + Ca-HMB in preventing the
decline of lean body mass over a period of bed rest compared to
exercise only [16]. Muscle strength: Muscle strength increased
in two studies with exercise but no additional effect of Ca-
HMB was found. In the third study [37], no improvement in
upper or lower body strength was found. Physical
performance: The two studies showed an improvement in the
performance of the Timed Up and Go test with exercise but did
not show any added effect of nutritional supplementation and
exercise. In a single study, no effect on the Short Physical
Performance Battery (SPPB) test was found [16].
Summary: Muscle mass increased with exercise in 3/3
RCTs and an interactive effect of HMB was found in 1/3
RCTs; Muscle strength increased with exercises in 2/3 RCTs
with no additional effect of HMB; Physical performance in-
creased with exercise (TUG only) in 2/2 RCTs with no addi-
tional effect of HMB.
Multi-nutrient intervention
Five studies reported results of treatment combining multi-
nutrients and exercise on muscle strength; four of the five
studies also looked at muscle mass and physical performance.
Studies were performed on community-dwelling participants
[14, 42, 43], frail retirement community residents [38], or
nursing home residents [39, 40]. The majority of studies were
of poor quality [14, 39, 40, 42, 43].
Muscle mass: Two out of four studies did not report any
improvement in fat-free mass with exercise or with exercise
combined with multi-nutrient supplementation [38, 42, 43].
Two studies reported an increase in muscle mass with exercise
[14, 39, 40] but only in the cross-sectional area for the study of
Fiatarone et al. [39, 40]. One of these failed to show any
additional effect of nutritional supplementation [14] and the
other did not describe the additional effect of multi-nutrient
supplementation [39, 40]. Muscle strength: Results were het-
erogeneous for the five studies that assessed the combined
effect of exercise and multi-nutrient supplementation on mus-
cle strength. Two studies [14, 42] showed a significant im-
provement in muscle strength with exercise, one [42] did not
report any additional effect of nutrition whereas the other
study [14], reported greater improvement in isometric knee
flexion in the group receiving combined exercise and multi-
nutrient supplementation versus only exercise. Fiatarone et al.
[39, 40] also reported an increase of muscle strength with
exercise but did not describe the difference between the exer-
cise only and combined multi-nutrient and exercise group.
Finally, two other studies [38, 41] did not report any increase
of muscle strength with treatment. Physical performance:

RCTs with no additional effect of multi-nutrient; Muscle
strength increased with exercises in 3/5 RCTs and an addi-
tional effect of multi-nutrient was found in 1/5 RCTs; Physical
performance increased with exercise in 3/4 RCTs with no ad-
ditional effect of multi-nutrient.
Creatine supplementation
Five good-quality studies have reported results of the effects of
creatine supplementation on muscle mass and muscle strength;
four of these also reported effects on physical performance. The
protocols of supplementation were heterogeneous with three
studies using 5 g/day of creatine while the two other studies
used a higher dose of creatine for the first week followed by
5 g/day in one of the study and 0.1 g/kg/day in the second study.
The study duration varied from 12 weeks to 6 months.
Muscle mass: four out of the 5 studies showed greater im-
provement of muscle mass in the group treated with the com-
bination of exercise and creatine compared to the control
group with exercise only. The other study showed a significant
increase in muscle mass with exercise but without any addi-
tional effect of creatine supplementation. Muscle strength:
Muscle strength improved with exercise in all studies, with
the exception of handgrip strength, which remained un-
changed in one study [48]. Several studies found additional
effects of creatine supplementation in addition to exercise on:
bench press [11, 19, 23], knee extension [19, 48, 49], biceps
curl performance [19], leg press [19], ankle dorsiflexion [48],
isokinetic muscle strength [49], and, finally, endurance of
knee extension [49]. Physical performance: Results were less
consistent regarding physical performance. Two studies [48,
49] reported an improvement in physical performance with
exercise but did not report any additional effects of creatine
supplementation. One study reported no improvement in
physical performance with either exercise or exercise plus
creatine [11]. The final study found a greater improvement
in the 30-s chair stand test and in an exercise where partici-
pants raised themselves from the floor, in the group receiving
combined exercise and creatine [19].
Summary: Muscle mass increased with exercises in 5/5
RCTs and an additional effect of creatine was found in 4/5
RCTs; Muscle strength increased with exercises in 5/5 RCTs
and an additive effect of creatine was found, for some of the
muscle strength outcomes, in 4/5 RCTs; Physical performance
increased with exercises in 3/4 RCTs and an interactive effect
of creatine was found in 1/4 RCTs.
Vitamin D supplementation
Two studies [46, 47] reported effects of combined exercise
and vitamin D3 supplementation on muscle strength and phys-
ical performance. One of those studies also reported effect on
arm, waist and hip circumferences as well as lean mass [47].
The vitamin D3 dose was 400 IU/day for 9 months in the study
of Bunout et al. [47] and 50,000 IU/week (after an initial
injection of 100,000 IU at study entry) for 8 weeks for the
study of Binder et al. [46]. This last study was graded as
having a poor quality [46] whereas the study of Bunout
et al. [47] was a good-quality study.
Muscle mass: Only one study reported results on muscle
mass [47]. No effects of exercise alone or of exercise com-
bined with vitamin D supplementation were observed. Indeed,
no significant changes in weight, circumferences, or body
composition measured by DXA were observed in any of the
groups. Muscle strength: Both studies reported significant im-
provement in muscle strength with exercise but did not report
any difference between the exercise-only group and the group
with combined exercise and vitamin D supplementation.
Physical performance: Binder et al. [46] reported improved
balance with exercise in a population of elderly nursing home
residents with dementia. No additional effect of vitamin D
supplementation was found and no improvement in gait speed
was evident in either group. Bunout et al. [47] reported a
significant improvement in the Timed Up and Go test for the
group with combined vitamin D and exercise but no differ-
ence for the SPPB test between groups.
Summary: Muscle mass did not improve with exercise and
no additional effect of vitamin D was found; Muscle strength
increased with exercise in 2/2 RCTs with no additional effect
of vitamin D; Physical performance increased, for some of the
physical performance outcomes, in 2/2 RCTs with no addi-
tional effect of vitamin D, except for TUG in 1/2 RCTs.
Other supplementation
Our systematic review identified six studies of good quality that
used other types of nutritional supplements: green tea in elderly
men and women [15], magnesium oxide in healthy elderly sub-
jects [21], milk fat globule membrane in frail women [28], soy
isoflavones in frail older women [9, 10], vitamin and mineral-
enhanced dairy and fruit products in frail community-dwelling
older people [44, 45] and finally, tea catechin in sarcopenic
women [18]. Four studies were 12 weeks in length [15, 18,
21, 28], one was 6-months in length [9, 10], and the last one
was 17 weeks in length [44, 45].
Muscle mass: A significant effect of exercise alone on mus-
cle mass was seen in various studies: in waist and hip circum-
ference in men in the green tea [15] study, hip circumference
in the soy isoflavones [9, 10]study participants, lean mass in
the vitamin and mineral-enhanced dairy and fruit products
1828
Osteoporos Int (2017) 28:1817–1833
 [44, 45]study, and leg lean mass in tea catechin [18]. No ad-
ditional effects of nutritional supplements were observed
across studies. Muscle strength: Exercise increased bench
press and 1RM leg press without an additional effect of soy
isoflavones [9, 10] and knee extension without additional ef-
fects of tea catechin [18]. A small increase of quadriceps
strength was also shown in one study but the difference be-
tween groups was not described [44, 45]. No effect of treat-
ment was found on knee extension and handgrip strength in
the other studies [9, 10, 21, 28]. Physical performance:
Exercise combined with magnesium oxide significantly im-
proved performance in the SPPB test, the chair stand test, and
in the 4-m walking speed in the study of Veronese et al. [21].
TUG, usual gait speed, and maximum walking speed signifi-
cantly improved in the exercise + tea catechin group compared
to exercise group only in another study of Kim et al. [18]
Walking speed and TUG test performance also improved with
exercise in the study of Kim et al. [28] but no additional effect
of milk fat globule membrane was described. In the study by
Chin A Paw et al., improvements in physical performance
were described but the additional effect of vitamin- and
mineral-enhanced dairy and fruit products was not described
[44, 45]. Finally, the chair stand test did not improve with
treatment in two other studies [9, 10, 18].
Summary: Muscle mass increased with exercise in 4/6
RCTs and no additional effect of nutrition was found;
Muscle strength increased with exercise in 3/5 RCTs and no
interactive effect of nutrition was found; Physical perfor-
mance increased with exercise in 4/5 RCTs and an additional
effect of nutrition was found in 2/5 RCTs.
Discussion
This systematic review aimed to summarize results of RCTs
assessing the effect of an intervention combining physical
activity and dietary supplement on muscle mass and muscle
function of subjects aged 60 years and older. Following a
systematic review previously performed in 2013 by Denison
et al. including 17 RCTs, we performed an update of this
comprehensive systematic review and identified 21 RCTs
published between April 2013 and October 2015. Thus, 37
RCTSs assessing the impact of a therapeutic intervention con-
taining both physical activity and a nutritional supplement on
muscle parameters were included in the present work. The
study protocols were quite heterogeneous. Different types of
physical activities have been studied in different populations
that varied in sex, settings, and health status. Moreover, within
each category of dietary supplements, the supplement dose
and the length of study differed across RCTs.
Among the 37 RCTs included in the systematic review,
34 RCTs assessed the impact of intervention on muscle
mass in elderly subjects. In almost 80% of the RCTs (27/

 34 RCTs), muscle mass increased with exercise training.
In the majority of studies where no effect of exercise was
observed, these were undertaken in frail subjects, residing
in a nursing home, or, subjects with limited mobility. A
hypothesis could be that the physical condition of these
subjects did not allow them to perform the protocol for
the physical activity intervention correctly. The majority
of studies proposed three sessions per week. Fewer ses-
sions may compromise efficacy of the physical activity
intervention. An additional effect of nutritional interven-
tion on muscle mass was only found in 8 RCTs (23.5%),
which were all of high quality (4 or 5 points in the Jadad
Scale), 4 using creatine, 3 using proteins, and 1 using
HMB as dietary supplement. The majority (75%) of stud-
ies using creatine as a dietary supplement showed a higher
effect on muscle mass once exercise intervention was
combine with creatine. The combination of creatine sup-
plementation and resistance training therefore seems to act
synergistically. Only 3 of the 12 RCTs using protein as a
dietary supplement reported an additional effect of protein
when combined with physical activity. These three studies
varied in type and dose of protein with no specific simi-
larity between them that could explain their positive re-
sults as distinct from the other nine studies that did not
report an effect on mass muscle with protein. Because of
blunted response in muscle protein synthesis in older
adults and reduced post-prandial inhibition of muscle pro-
tein breakdown, some authors recommended increasing
protein intake to 1.2 g/kg body weight/day in older adults
and even more in frail older adults or elderly with acute or
chronic disease [50, 51]. Based on these recommenda-
tions, we hypothesized a beneficial effect of protein sup-
plementation in muscle function in older people.
However, it should be discussed that the baseline dietary
intake of protein has not been reported in the different
studies. Therefore, we do not know if the target of
1.2 g/kg/day has been reached or if differences could have
been observed between populations who reached this tar-
get and those who did not. A meta-analysis published in
2012 [52] showed a positive effect of protein supplemen-
tation on muscle mass gains during prolonged resistance-
type exercise training in older subjects. This probably
means that the type of exercise training could have a
non-negligible impact on results. Indeed, in this system-
atic review, inclusion criteria were not limited to one par-
ticular type of physical exercise. Finally, one out of the
three studies using HMB as a dietary supplement also
showed an intergroup difference between subjects under-
going exercise intervention and subjects undergoing a
combination of exercise and dietary intervention. Of note,
this study comprised subjects confined to bedrest.
Subjects receiving a combination of exercise and HMB
supplementation were more prevented for decline of lean
body mass over bed rest compared to subjects undergoing
exercises only. In this study, HMB supplementation did
not increase muscle mass but prevented its decline.
Muscle strength increased in 82.8% of the studies (29/35
RCTs) following an exercise intervention and, once again,
dietary supplementation showed additional benefits in only a
small number of studies (8/35 RCTS, 22.8%) principally for
creatine but only at specific muscle sites. In 4 out of the 5
RCTs using creatine as a dietary supplement (dose range 5–
20 g/day), the group treated with the combination of exercise
and dietary intervention showed greater improvement of mus-
cle strength compared to exercise only. Three good-quality
RCTs using protein as a dietary supplement also showed a
greater effect on muscle strength when compared to the exer-
cise group. These three studies were providing a high amount
of protein with, respectively, 45, 40, and 15 g (collagen pep-
tide) daily whereas the mean dose of supplementation in other
studies was approximately 20 g/day. The dose of supplemen-
tation is likely to contribute to the inconsistent findings be-
tween studies. Handgrip strength, a component of sarcopenia
definitions, was an outcome in 13 RCTs assessing the effect of
a combined exercise and dietary intervention. Approximately
half of the studies (6/13 RCTs) showed an improvement in
grip strength with exercise. However, none of these RCTs
showed an additional effect of dietary supplementation.
Highlighted by these last results, it should be noted that, even
if this systematic review revealed an increase of muscle
strength following exercise in the majority of the studies, this
seems particularly true for leg muscle strength.
A total of 29 RCTs also assessed the impact of combined
physical activity and dietary supplementation on physical per-
formance. We observed, in the majority of studies, an im-
provement in physical performance outcomes following an
exercise intervention (26/28 RCTs, 92.8%). In the two studies
that did not report an improvement on physical performance,
one was performed on frail people and the other one on hos-
pitalized people. Physical performance was assessed using a
variety of measures in the reported studies. The most com-
monly used measures were gait speed (used in 17 RCTs),
followed by chair stand test (used in 13 RCTs), Timed Up
and Go test (used in 8 RCTs), and SPPB test (used in 6
RCTs). The heterogeneity of both the type of exercise inter-
vention and physical performance outcomes impedes general
statements of findings on the association between exercise
training and improvements in physical performance.
Interaction of exercise and nutrition was found in only
17.8% of these studies (5/28 RCTs): one study when a
multi-nutrient was used as a dietary supplement, another with
creatine, a third study with vitamin D, another with tea cate-
chin, and finally, one with magnesium oxide.
This study is an update of an existing systematic review
and it followed the same rigorous methodology as the previ-
ous one. We searched multiple electronic databases to identify
1830
Osteoporos Int (2017) 28:1817–1833
 as many studies as possible that would meet our inclusion
criteria. Nevertheless, this review is limited by the disparity
between the studies. The exercise interventions described in
the RCTs varied in regards of the types of exercises, doses,
intensity, and duration. Moreover, adherence to these proto-
cols were not reported, which impacts the assessment of the
real effect of exercise on muscle features. Supplementations
provided also varied, not merely for the dosage, but also for
the duration, the way, and the frequency of administration. It
must also be noted that half of these studies were not double
blinded. These parameters are likely to be key factors in mod-
ulating the outcomes of studies investigating the potential
benefit of dietary supplementation to further augment gains
in muscle mass and strength during exercise training.
Moreover, the majority of individual RCTs did not take into
account the baseline nutritional status of the population. It
makes perfect sense that elders, close to undernutrition in
some of the dietary supplements presented, failed to respond
properly to exercise training meant to increase their muscle
mass and strength. Even a reasonable dose of the supplement
may be insufficient if participants are very sick, frail, and/or
malnourished at baseline. In the same vein, even if exercise
could have a positive effect, nutritional supplement may not
be effective in very healthy, fit, and/or vigorous elderly.
Nutrition supplementation is likely to be more efficient if mal-
nutrition is present. The specific elderly subpopulation should
be regarded when evaluating the need for nutritional support
during exercise training. Finally, even if our purpose was to
assess combined effects of exercise training and dietary sup-
plementation on muscle outcomes in sarcopenic subjects, a
very limited number of included studies have been performed
specifically on subjects affected by sarcopenia. Because of the
condition of sarcopenic patients, it is likely that the effects
observed in this systematic review would have been lesser in
solely sarcopenic patients. It was however difficult for this
study to focus only on sarcopenic subjects. Indeed, there are
no universally accepted criteria for the diagnosis of sarcopenia
in an operational sense. Therefore, we chose to focus on el-
derly subjects in a broader sense instead of focusing on one or
more restricted definitions of sarcopenia.
In conclusion, physical exercise has a beneficial impact on
muscle mass, muscle strength, or physical performance in
healthy subjects aged 60 years and older. However, the addi-
tional effect of dietary supplementation has only been reported
in a limited number of studies. For the majority of studies
included in this systematic review, the population was com-
posed of healthy older subjects. Studies assessing the impact
of a combined exercise intervention and dietary intervention
are still lacking in frail and sarcopenic populations, popula-
tions suffering from nutritional deficiency, or populations at
risk of malnutrition. Further well-designed and well-
conducted studies performed on these types of populations
should be implemented. It seems likely that nutritional
interventions in populations who are presenting nutritional
or physical deficiencies would be more beneficial than inter-
ventions in well-nourished and replete populations. There is a
need of a rigorous documentation of subject’s baseline exer-
cise level and nutritional status prior to implement interven-
tion regimens in those future studies.
