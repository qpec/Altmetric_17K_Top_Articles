Blood-based NfL
A biomarker for differential diagnosis of parkinsonian disorder
ABSTRACT
Objective: To determine if blood neurofilament light chain (NfL) protein can discriminate between
Parkinson disease (PD) and atypical parkinsonian disorders (APD) with equally high diagnostic
accuracy as CSF NfL, and can therefore improve the diagnostic workup of parkinsonian disorders.
Methods: The study included 3 independent prospective cohorts: the Lund (n 5 278) and London
(n 5 117) cohorts, comprising healthy controls and patients with PD, progressive supranuclear
palsy (PSP), corticobasal syndrome (CBS), and multiple system atrophy (MSA), as well as an early
disease cohort (n 5 109) of patients with PD, PSP, MSA, or CBS with disease duration #3 years.
Blood NfL concentration was measured using an ultrasensitive single molecule array (Simoa)
method, and the diagnostic accuracy to distinguish PD from APD was investigated.
Results: We found strong correlations between blood and CSF concentrations of NfL (r $ 0.73–
0.84, p # 0.001). Blood NfL was increased in patients with MSA, PSP, and CBS (i.e., all APD
groups) when compared to patients with PD as well as healthy controls in all cohorts (p , 0.001).
Furthermore, in the Lund cohort, blood NfL could accurately distinguish PD from APD (area under
the curve [AUC] 0.91) with similar results in both the London cohort (AUC 0.85) and the early
disease cohort (AUC 0.81).
Conclusions: Quantification of blood NfL concentration can be used to distinguish PD from APD.
Blood-based NfL might consequently be included in the diagnostic workup of patients with parkin-
sonian symptoms in both primary care and specialized clinics.
Classification of evidence: This study provides Class III evidence that blood NfL levels discriminate
between PD and APD. Neurology® 2017;88:930–937

The differential diagnosis between Parkinson disease (PD) and atypical parkinsonian disorders
(APD), i.e., multiple system atrophy (MSA), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and corticobasal
degeneration (CBD), is often difficult due to the overlapping symptomatology, especially during
the early stages of the disease course.1,2 Although there are not yet any established diagnostic
methods that can reliably separate PD from APD, neurofilament light chain (NfL) protein in
CSF is a promising marker for APD. Our group and others have previously shown that the CSF
concentration of NfL is increased in APD but not in PD3,4 and that NfL in CSF can discriminate
between PD and APD with a high degree of diagnostic accuracy.5–7 However, lumbar puncture is
not easily implemented in the primary care setting and many patients feel apprehensive about

 lumbar puncture, reducing the clinical useful-
ness of these findings. We recently developed an
ultrasensitive single molecule array (Simoa)
immunoassay for NfL, which is by the far the
most sensitive platform for detection of NfL,
and it provides better agreement between CSF
and blood-derived NfL values compared to
other analytical platforms.8 We therefore inves-
tigated if the levels of NfL in blood are increased
in study participants with APD (i.e., PSP, MSA,
and CBD) compared with patients with PD
and healthy controls in 3 different cohorts
including one cohort with early-stage disease.
We also investigated whether blood-based NfL
can discriminate between PD and APD with
the same high diagnostic accuracy as CSF NfL.
METHODS Standard protocol approvals, registrations,
and patient consents. The study was conducted in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the
regional ethical review boards in Lund, London, Umeå, and
Gothenburg. All participants provided written informed consent
to participate in the study.
Primary research questions/classification of evidence. Our
primary research question was to determine whether blood NfL
can discriminate between PD and APD. The study provides Class
III evidence that blood NfL levels discriminate between PD and
APD with high diagnostic accuracy.
Participants. Cohort 1 (Lund cohort). Patients with PD (n 5
171), MSA (n 5 30), PSP (n 5 19), or corticobasal syndrome
(CBS, n 5 5) and neurologically healthy controls (n 5 53) were
enrolled as part of the prospective and longitudinal Swedish Bio-
FINDER study (biofinder.se). In this convenience series, study
participants were recruited at the Neurology Clinic, Skåne Uni-
versity Hospital, Lund, Sweden, between 2008 and 2014.9,10 The
diagnostic criteria for cohort 1 are described in the e-Methods at
Neurology.org.
Cohort 2 (London cohort). Patients with PD (n 5 20), MSA
(n 5 30), PSP (n 5 29), or CBS (n 5 12) and neurologically
healthy controls (n 5 26) were enrolled at clinics at the National
Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square,

 London. The study is prospective and longitudinal in nature.
Participants were consecutively enrolled over a 2-year period from
2011 to 2013. The diagnostic criteria for cohort 2 are described
in the e-Methods at Neurology.org.
In both cohorts, healthy controls underwent a thorough
clinical, neurologic, and cognitive examination. Individuals with
cognitive impairment or parkinsonian symptoms and signs were
not included in the control group.
Cohort 3 (early disease cohort). Cohort 3 included patients
with PD (n 5 53), MSA (n 5 28), PSP (n 5 22), or CBS (n 5 6)
with early-stage disease (disease duration #3 years). The
recruitment and demographic characteristics of cohort 3 are
described in the e-Methods.
Biochemical analyses. Blood and CSF sampling procedures are
described in the e-Methods. A sensitive sandwich method (NF-
light® ELISA kit; UmanDiagnostics AB, Umeå, Sweden) was used
to measure CSF NfL as previously described.11,12 NfL concentra-
tions in blood were measured using the monoclonal antibodies
and calibrator from the NfL assay, transferred onto the Simoa
platform using a homebrew kit (Quanterix; Lexington, MA), as
previously described.13 Details of the assay performance are given
in the e-Methods.
MRI. In the Lund cohort, a subgroup of 102 study participants,
including 39 controls, 89 patients with PD, 7 patients with PSP,
8 patients with MSA, and 2 patients with CBS, underwent MRI
(described in the e-Methods).
Statistical analyses. SPSS (IBM, Armonk, NY) was used for sta-
tistical analysis. One outlier with plasma NfL value above 10 SD of
the mean was excluded from the analysis. Associations between 2
continuous variables were tested with Spearman correlation or
linear regression models. Group differences were assessed with
Mann-Whitney test
and
univariate
general linear
analysis.
Regression models were used to adjust for the confounding
effects of age and sex. The diagnostic accuracy of blood NfL was
examined using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. A
detailed description of the statistical analysis is given in the e-
Methods. p # 0.05 Was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS Demographics. Demographic and clinical
data for the Lund and London cohorts are shown
in tables 1 and 2, respectively. In the Lund cohort,
blood levels of NfL correlated with age in the whole
cohort (r 5 0.449, p , 0.001), in controls (r 5
0.436, p 5 0.001), and in patients with PD (r 5
0.577, p , 0.001), but not in patients with APD
(i.e., PSP, MSA, or CBS). Blood levels of NfL were
higher in women than in men in the whole popula-
tion (p 5 0.041) and in patients with PD (p 5
0.040). We found similar results in the London
cohort, where blood levels of NfL correlated with
age in the whole cohort (r 5 0.290, p 5 0.001), in
controls (r 5 0.411, p 5 0.037), and in patients with
PD (r 5 0.483, p 5 0.031), but not in patients with
APD. Blood levels of NfL were higher in women than
in men in patients with APD only (p 5 0.048).
Because of the association between blood NfL and
age and sex, we additionally adjusted statistical analy-
sis as described below for the confounding effects of
these factors.

 Correlations between the levels of NfL in CSF and blood.
The Lund cohort. Blood NfL correlated strongly with
CSF NfL in the whole cohort (r 5 0.730, p ,
0.001, figure 1A). The correlations were moderate
within individual diagnostic groups most likely due
to the smaller sample size: controls, r 5 0.572, p ,
0.001; PD, r 5 0.589, p , 0.001; APD, r 5 0.419,
p 5 0.003. Blood NfL correlated with CSF NfL also
when adjusting for the confounding effects of age and
sex (the whole cohort, b 5 0.697, p , 0.001; con-
trols, b 5 0.344, p 5 0.033; PD, b 5 0.481, p ,
0.001; APD, b 5 0.523, p , 0.001).
The London cohort. Supporting our findings in the
Lund cohort, blood NfL correlated strongly with
CSF NfL in the total sample (r 5 0.840, p ,
0.001, figure 1B). The correlations were moderate
within individual diagnostic groups: controls, r 5
0.406, p 5 0.040; APD, r 5 0.599, p , 0.001.
The number of PD cases with available CSF NfL
measurements (n 5 5) was too low to conduct statis-
tical analysis. Linear regression analysis revealed asso-
ciations between blood and CSF levels of NfL also
when adjusting for confounding effect of age and sex
(the whole cohort, b 5 0.796, p , 0.001; controls,
b 5 0.449, p 5 0.022; APD, b 5 0.677, p , 0.001).
Blood levels of NfL in the different diagnostic groups.
The Lund cohort. The levels of blood NfL were clearly
increased in PSP, MSA, and CBS when compared to
controls (PSP, p , 0.001; MSA, p , 0.001; CBS,
p , 0.001) and patients with PD (PSP, p , 0.001;
MSA, p , 0.001; CBS, p , 0.001), with all analyses
adjusted for age and sex (figure 2A). The significant
differences in blood NfL between the PD and APD
groups were not affected when additionally controlling
for disease duration (all p , 0.001).
The London cohort. The results obtained in the Lon-
don cohort were similar to those obtained in the
Lund cohort (figure 2B). The levels of blood NfL
were clearly increased in PSP, MSA, and CBS when
compared to controls (PSP, p , 0.001; MSA, p ,
0.001; CBS, p , 0.001) and patients with PD (PSP,
p 5 0.001; MSA, p , 0.001; CBS, p , 0.001). In
addition, we found that in the London cohort, blood
NfL was increased in patients with PD compared
with controls (p 5 0.011) but the levels were far
below those observed in patients with APD (figure
2B). The significant differences in blood NfL
between the PD and APD groups were not affected
when additionally controlling for disease duration
(PSP, p 5 0.011; MSA, p 5 0.002; CBS, p , 0.001).
The early disease cohort. Because differential diagnosis
of parkinsonian disorders is particularly challenging
during the early disease stages, we included a third
cohort of patients who all had a disease duration
between 0 and 3 years. In agreement with the data
in the Lund and London cohorts, the levels of blood
NfL were increased in PSP (p , 0.001), MSA (p ,
0.001), and CBS (p , 0.001) compared to patients
with PD already early in the disease (figure 2C).
The diagnostic accuracy of blood NfL. The Lund cohort.
Blood NfL distinguished patients with PD from pa-
tients with APD with high accuracy (area under the

Correlations between blood and CSF levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL)
Blood and CSF NfL concentrations were measured in the Lund (A) and London (B) cohorts. NfL measurements of matched
CSF samples were available for 245 participants in the Lund cohort (147 Parkinson disease [PD], 28 multiple system atro-
phy [MSA], 15 progressive supranuclear palsy [PSP], 5 corticobasal syndrome [CBS], and 50 controls) and 97 participants in
the London cohort (5 PD, 29 MSA, 26 PSP, 11 CBS, and 26 controls).

0.87–0.95; figure 3A) and with a specificity of 91%
and a sensitivity of 82%. The results were similar
when individual APD groups (PSP, MSA, and
CBS) were analyzed separately (table e-1). Blood
NfL could also accurately separate patients with PD
and controls grouped together from APD (AUC 0.92,
95% CI 0.88–0.95, specificity 92%, sensitivity
82%). The diagnostic accuracy for blood NfL was
as high as for CSF NfL (table e-2).
The London cohort. Likewise, in the London cohort,
blood NfL could differentiate PD from APD (AUC
0.85, 95% CI 0.72–0.98; figure 3B) with a specificity
of 90% and a sensitivity of 80%. The results were
similar when individual APD groups (PSP, MSA, and
CBS) were analyzed separately (table e-1). The diag-
nostic accuracy was even higher when separating APD
from PD and controls (AUC 0.91, 95% CI 0.85–
0.98, specificity 83%, sensitivity 93%).
The early disease cohort. Similar to the Lund and
London cohort, blood NfL accurately distinguished
PD from APD in patients with early-stage disease
(AUC 0.81, 95% CI 0.73–0.90, 80% specificity, 70%
sensitivity; figure 3C). The results were comparable when

2 patient groups that were recruited in Göteborg and Umeå, respectively (e-Methods). ROC analysis produced similar results when diagnostic accuracy
of blood NfL for differentiating PD from APD was assessed in Göteborg (area under the curve [AUC] 0.80) and Umeå (AUC 5 0.81) patients separately.

 individual APD groups (PSP, MSA, and CBS) were
analyzed separately (table e-1).
Correlations among blood NfL, CSF biomarkers, and
clinical symptoms. The Lund cohort. First we studied the
associations of blood NfL and other established CSF bi-
omarkers than CSF NfL. All analyses below were
adjusted for age and sex. In the whole cohort, we found
that higher levels of blood NfL were associated with
lower levels of CSF Ab42 (b 5 20.201, p 5 0.001)
and higher levels of CSF tau (b 5 0.151, p 5 0.020),
but not phosphorylated tau (p-tau). There were no dif-
ferences in blood NfL levels between participants with
pathologic compared to normal CSF Ab42 levels (con-
trols, p 5 0.126; PD, p 5 0.490; APD, p 5 0.181).
Next we studied the associations between blood
NfL and clinical characteristics in the PD and APD
cohorts, respectively. In the PD cohort, we found
that blood NfL correlated with disease duration
(b 5 0.278, p , 0.001), the levodopa equivalent
(b 5 0.235, p 5 0.003), Hoehn & Yahr stage
(b 5 0.187, p 5 0.004), Unified Parkinson’s Disease
Rating Scale (UPDRS)–III motor score (b 5 0.227,
p , 0.001), Timed Up and Go Test (b 5 0.164, p 5
0.036), and tandem gait test (b 5 0.237, p 5 0.045);
i.e., higher blood NfL levels were associated with
longer disease duration and more aggravated motor
symptoms in PD (blood NfL concentrations across
UPDRS-III, Hoehn & Yahr, and disease duration
ranges are shown in table e-3). However, in APD,
blood NfL only correlated with Hoehn & Yahr stage
(b 5 0.286, p 5 0.040) and UPDRS-III motor score
(b 5 0.449, p 5 0.001), but not with disease dura-
tion or the other clinical assessments.
The London cohort. In the London cohort, higher
levels of blood NfL were associated with lower levels
of CSF Ab42 in the whole cohort (b 5 20.182, p 5
0.034), but not with CSF tau and CSF p-tau. In PD
and APD groups, blood NfL did not correlate with
disease duration or Hoehn & Yahr stage.
The early disease cohort. Blood NfL was not associ-
ated with either disease duration or Hoehn & Yahr
stage in PD and APD groups (table e-4).
Correlations between blood NfL and white matter lesions
(WMLs). The Lund cohort. There were no differences in
WMLs between the diagnostic groups (Fazekas total
score, mean 6 SD; controls, 3.8 6 2.8; PD, 3.9 6
3.3; and APD, 4.1 6 3.3). Increased blood NfL was
associated with higher Fazekas scores in patients with
PD (r 5 0.328, p 5 0.002) but not in the control or
APD groups (r 5 0.309, p 5 0.056 and r 5 0.341,
p 5 0.181, respectively). However, the correlation in
patients with PD appeared to be confounded by the
effects of age and sex as linear regression models ad-
justing for these variables did not show associations
between blood NfL and WMLs.
DISCUSSION The results of the present study
strongly indicate that NfL when measured in blood
can be used to distinguish between patients with
PD and patients with PSP, MSA, and CBS with high
diagnostic accuracy (AUCs 0.81–0.91). The diagnos-
tic accuracy for NfL in blood was as high as that
obtained when using CSF NfL. The diagnostic utility
of blood NfL to separate patients with PD from pa-
tients with APD has not been studied previously, but
several publications have shown that the levels of NfL
in CSF can be used to distinguish between these dis-
orders with AUCs of about 0.85–0.90.5–7 Although
a number of other CSF biomarkers and biomarker
panels have been suggested to differentiate PD from
ADP,5–7 blood biomarkers offering sufficient diagnos-
tic accuracy are unavailable besides NfL. The current
results confirm that NfL levels in blood, quantified
with high-sensitivity immunoassays, reflect the levels
in the CSF13–15 and that the plasma NfL levels are
increased in PSP16 and other a-synucleinopathies.17
NfL is a marker of degeneration of large myelin-
ated axons.18 It is thus increased in CSF of several
neurologic disorders, including acute conditions such
as stroke19 and traumatic brain injury,20 as well as in
chronic neurodegenerative disorders such as APD
(PSP, MSA, and CBD),3–7 amyotrophic lateral scle-
rosis,14,15,21 and frontotemporal dementia.22,23 CSF
and blood NfL are not increased in PD, which could
be due in part to less severe and widespread axonal
degeneration in PD compared to APD. Diffusion
MRI studies have shown extensive white matter dam-
age in PSP, MSA, and CBD, but not in PD.24–26 In
general, there were higher blood NfL levels in more
advanced PD (table e-3); nonetheless, the changes
were much more modest compared to those observed
in APD. Previous studies on NfL in CSF in patients
with APD from our groups show that NfL correlates
with disease severity but not disease duration.6,7 The
lack of association between blood NfL and disease
duration indicates that the rate of degeneration of
myelinated axons is rather constant throughout the
disease course in APD. In this study, we could repli-
cate these findings using the blood test for NfL, fur-
ther adding to the reliability of blood NfL in APD.
These findings together also suggest that NfL in
blood may be useful in clinical trials to detect treat-
ment effects on axonal degeneration.
It is often difficult to differentiate clinically
between PD and APD, particularly during the
early disease stages. For the individual patient and
caregiver, a correct and early diagnosis is highly
important.
Also,
with
the
hope
for
advanced
disease-modifying therapies, early and correct diagno-
sis is vital to identify the patients who would benefit
from certain disease-specific treatments. In several
countries, NfL in CSF has over the last decade been

 shown to be a useful addition to the clinical workup
of patients with parkinsonism. However, the clinical
usefulness has been limited by the invasiveness of
lumbar puncture. Therefore, the finding that NfL
in blood correlates with and is equal to NfL in CSF
in distinguishing PD from APD may prove to be
highly useful in the clinical setting and could even
be used in the primary care setting. Further, blood-
derived NfL might be used in clinical trials where
repeated measures may be necessary to follow the rate
of axonal degeneration over time.
Although NfL in CSF as well as in blood can differ-
entiate APD from PD, NfL cannot be used to separate
PSP, MSA, and CBD from each other. However,
increased levels of blood NfL in a patient with parkin-
sonism may indicate that the patient has APD and the
doctor should look carefully for symptoms and clinical
signs supporting PSP, MSA, or CBS. Certain other
diagnostic methods, such as MRI or fluorodeoxyglu-
cose PET, might also help to distinguish between these
atypical parkinsonian disorders.27
The patients with APD included in the Lund and
London cohorts had disease durations of 4–6 years on
average. From a clinical point of view, it is most
important to establish methods that can separate
APD from PD during the earliest stages of the disease
course. Importantly, the data obtained in the early
disease cohort (with symptom onset within 0–3 years)
show that blood NfL is increased in APD and can
accurately differentiate APD from PD even in pa-
tients with a short disease duration.
There are limitations with the present study. The
diagnoses of the study participants were based on
clinical criteria and not neuropathologic examination.
However, the clinical diagnoses were made by medi-
cal doctors specialized in movement disorders and the
patients were followed over time with reassessments
at each follow-up visit. This should increase the diag-
nostic accuracy, as compared to what can be achieved
with diagnoses made at a single visit. In the London
cohort, 9 patients eventually underwent neuropatho-
logic examination and the neuropathologic diagnoses
confirmed the clinical diagnoses in all 9 cases. Impor-
tantly, any potential clinical misdiagnosis in the pres-
ent study is more likely to result in underestimation,
rather than overestimation, of the diagnostic accuracy
of blood NfL when separating PD from APD.
Blood biomarkers have previously been suggested
to improve the diagnostic accuracy of neurodegenera-
tive disorder like Alzheimer disease or MSA, but sub-
sequent studies have not been able to reproduce the
findings.4,28,29 This highlights the importance of always
using at least 2 independent cohorts obtained at dif-
ferent clinics when evaluating biomarkers. Impor-
tantly, in the present study we obtained similar
results for blood NfL in 3 independent cohorts,
indicating that this is indeed a robust marker for dif-
ferentiating PD from APD. Absolute concentrations of
NfL differed between the cohorts most likely due to
lot-to-lot variation in assay performance or matrix ef-
fects (plasma vs serum). Thus development of a fully
automated clinical grade assay and establishment of
cutoff points would be necessary for implementation
of blood-based NfL measurements in clinical practice.
The present study has shown in 3 independent co-
horts that NfL concentrations in blood are increased
in PSP, MSA, and CBS when compared to PD and
healthy controls. This easily accessible biomarker of
axonal degeneration may improve the diagnostic
workup of patients with parkinsonian symptoms in
specialized clinics as well as in primary care settings.
