STUDY QUESTION: Is preconception dietary intake associated with reduced fecundity as measured by a longer time to pregnancy (TTP)?
SUMMARY ANSWER: Lower intake of fruit and higher intake of fast food in the preconception period were both associated with a longer TTP.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Several lifestyle factors, such as smoking and obesity, have consistently been associated with a longer
TTP or infertility, but the role of preconception diet in women remains poorly studied. Healthier foods or dietary patterns have been asso-
ciated with improved fertility, however, these studies focused on women already diagnosed with or receiving treatments for infertility, rather
than in the general population.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This was a multi-center pregnancy-based cohort study of 5628 nulliparous women with low-risk
singleton pregnancies who participated in the Screening for Pregnancy Endpoints (SCOPE) study.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: A total of 5598 women were included. Data on retrospectively reported
TTP and preconception dietary intake were collected during the first antenatal study visit (14–16 weeks’ gestation). Dietary information for
the 1 month prior to conception was obtained from food frequency questions for fruit, green leafy vegetables, fish and fast foods, by a
research midwife. Use of any fertility treatments associated with the current pregnancy was documented (yes, n = 340, no, n = 5258).
Accelerated failure time models with log normal distribution were conducted to estimate time ratios (TR) and 95% CIs. The impact of differ-
ences in dietary intake on infertility (TTP >12 months) was compared using a generalized linear model (Poisson distribution) with robust vari-
ance estimates, with resulting relative risks (RR) and 95% CIs. All analyses were controlled for a range of maternal and paternal confounders.
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore potential biases common to TTP studies.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Lower intakes of fruit and higher intakes of fast food were both associated with
modest increases in TTP and infertility. Absolute differences between the lowest and highest categories of intake for fruit and fast food were

 in the order of 0.6–0.9 months for TTP and 4–8% for infertility. Compared with women who consumed fruit ≥3 times/day, the adjusted
effects of consuming fruit ≥1–<3 times/day (TR = 1.06, 95% CI: 0.97–1.15), 1–6 times/week (TR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.01–1.22) or <1–3
times/month (TR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.03–1.36), corresponded to 6, 11 and 19% increases in the median TTP (Ptrend = 0.007). Similarly, com-
pared with women who consumed fast food ≥4 times/week, the adjusted effects of consuming fast food ≥2–<4 times/week (TR = 0.89,
95% CI: 0.81–0.98), >0–<2 times/week (TR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69–0.89) or no fast food (TR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.61–0.95), corresponded to an
11, 21 and 24% reduction in the median TTP (Ptrend <0.001). For infertility, compared with women who consumed fruit ≥3 times/day, the
adjusted effects of consuming fruit ≥1–<3 times/day, 1–6 times/week or <1–3 times/month corresponded to a 7, 18 and 29% increase in
risk of infertility (Ptrend = 0.043). Similarly, compared with women who consumed fast food ≥4 times/week, the adjusted effects of consuming
fast food ≥2–<4 times/week, >0–<2 times/week, or no fast food, corresponded to an 18, 34 and 41% reduced risk of infertility (Ptrend
<0.001). Pre-pregnancy intake of green leafy vegetables or fish were not associated with TTP or infertility. Estimates remained stable across a
range of sensitivity analyses.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Collection of dietary data relied on retrospective recall and evaluated a limited range of
foods. Paternal dietary data was not collected and the potential for residual confounding cannot be eliminated. Compared to prospective
TTP studies, retrospective TTP studies are prone to a number of potential sources of bias.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: These findings underscore the importance of considering preconception diet for fecund-
ity outcomes and preconception guidance. Further research is needed assessing a broader range of foods and food groups in the preconcep-
tion period.

Introduction
Infertility, defined as the lack of a clinically detectable pregnancy over
12 months, affects millions of couples worldwide and is associated
with significant emotional and economic burden (World Health
Organisation, 2015). Numerous maternal and paternal lifestyle factors
have been associated with reductions in fertility including smoking
(Hassan and Killick, 2004; Harlev et al., 2015), excessive alcohol con-
sumption (Hassan and Killick, 2004; Mikkelsen et al., 2016), use of rec-
reational drugs (Alvarez, 2015), as well as maternal (Sim et al., 2014)
and paternal (Campbell et al., 2015) obesity.
While many of these lifestyle factors may be linked with diet, the
specific impacts of preconception maternal diet on fertility remain
poorly studied. Previous studies have focused on the role of diet on
fertility outcomes among women diagnosed with or receiving treat-
ments for infertility, rather than in the general population. In these
studies, greater adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern,
which includes a higher intake of fruits, vegetables and fish, was
associated with fewer couples consulting a physician for difficulties
conceiving (Toledo et al., 2011) and higher probability of achieving
pregnancy in couples undergoing IVF (Vujkovic et al., 2010). Similarly,
women with a higher dietary score, based on meeting dietary recom-
mendations for core food groups in the Netherlands (i.e. fruits, vegeta-
bles, meat, fish, whole wheat products and fats), had a greater chance
of ongoing pregnancy following fertility treatment (Twigt et al., 2012).
In contrast, greater consumption of foods with high glycemic index
(Chavarro et al., 2009) and a higher intake of energy from trans fats
(Chavarro et al., 2007) were associated with an increased risk of ovula-
tory infertility. Overall, these studies indicate healthier foods or dietary
patterns are associated with improved fertility. Given diet is a recog-
nized modifiable factor for a range of health outcomes, the identifica-
tion of food groups that are associated with infertility would be
important to assist women in improving pregnancy success.
The objective of this study was to examine the impact of preconcep-
tion diet on time to pregnancy (TTP) and infertility. We hypothesized
that a higher intake of healthier foods, such as fruits, vegetables and

 fish, and a lower intake of discretionary foods (fast foods) is associated
with a shorter TTP and a lower rate of infertility.
Materials and Methods
Study population
The Screening for Pregnancy Endpoints (SCOPE) study is a multi-center
prospective cohort study of 5628 pregnancies recruited from November
2004 to February 2011 in Adelaide (Australia), Auckland (New Zealand),
Cork (Ireland), and Leeds, London and Manchester (UK). Detailed
descriptions of the study have been published previously (McCowan et al.,
2009). Briefly, data were collected by a research midwife at 14–16 and
19–21 weeks’ gestation. Data for this study were taken from the interview
at 14–16 weeks. Couples were excluded from the current analysis if they
conceived following use of ART for male infertility (n = 19).
Ethical approval was obtained from New Zealand AKX/02/00/364,
Australia REC 1712/5/2008, London, Leeds and Manchester 06/MRE01/
98 and Cork ECM5 (10) 05/02/08 and all participants provided written
informed consent.
Assessment of dietary variables
At 15 ± 1 weeks’ gestation, women were asked to recall dietary intake in
the 1 month immediately preceding conception using single item questions
of specific foods. The use of single item questions has been shown to be
useful to assess gross level estimates and rank individuals on intakes, rather
than precise levels of intake (Yaroch et al., 2012). Number of servings of
foods was reported to the midwife for fruit (fresh fruit and fruit juice),
green leafy vegetables (vegetables high in folate such as spinach, cabbage,
lettuce, broccoli), fish (with prompts of fish such as salmon, trout, sardines,
shellfish and shrimp) and key discretionary foods reported to be consumed
from take-away or fast food outlets (i.e. frequency of intake of burgers,
fried chicken, pizza and hot chips were totaled as ‘fast food’). Frequency of
fruit was categorized as ≥3 times/day (reference), ≥1–<3 times/day, 1–6
times/week and <1–3 times/month. Frequency of green leafy vegetables was
categorized as ≥1 times/day (reference), 3–6 times/week, 1–2 times/week
and <1–3 times/month. Frequency of fish was categorized as ≥1 time/
week (reference), 1–3 times/month and never. Frequency of fast food was
categorized as never, >0–<2 times/week, ≥2–<4 times/week and ≥4
times/week (reference). Dietary intake categories were established a priori
following previously published data for the SCOPE cohort (McCowan et al.,
2010; North et al., 2011).
Assessment of outcome
Estimates of retrospectively reported TTP were derived from the following
question ‘duration of sex without contraception before conception with
father of baby’. Values, in months, were recorded in a continuous fashion
and used to define TTP. Infertility was defined as having a TTP of more
than 12 months.
Assessment of covariates
Information in each recruitment site was collected on demographics,
smoking, family, medical and gynecological history, diet and supplement
use, as well as anthropometric variables, such as height and weight, to
determine BMI. Maternal ethnicity was self-reported and binary coded as
Caucasian or other (90% were Caucasian). The socioeconomic index was
developed in New Zealand and is a measure of the individual’s socio-
economic status derived from a specific occupation (Davis et al., 1997). It
provides a value of 10–90 with a higher score indicating higher socio-
economic status (Galbraith et al., 1996). Self-reported polycystic ovary
syndrome (PCOS) was categorized as yes (confirmed by a scan and/or
blood test) or no/unsure. Women who had ≥1 of any previous miscar-
riage at ≤10 weeks’ gestation or >10 weeks’ gestation were binary coded
as yes/no for previous miscarriage. Cigarette use in the 3 months pre-
pregnancy was binary coded as yes or no, as quitting smoking prior to
pregnancy is recommended (World Health Organisation. 2010). Units of
alcohol per week in the 3 months pre-pregnancy was binary coded as yes
or no, based on official guidelines in several countries recommending no
alcohol intake for pregnant women and women trying to conceive
(International Alliance for Responsible Drinking (2016)). Women also
reported if the current conception was associated with the use of any fer-
tility treatments (e.g. IVF, ICSI, ovulation induction). Information collected
from the biological father included paternal age, and paternal height and
weight (to calculate BMI).
Statistical analyses
Frequencies and descriptive statistics for all women were expressed as
n (%) or as mean (SD). Median [inter-quartile range, IQR] was reported
when continuous variables were not normally distributed.
The impact of differences in dietary intake on TTP was investigated using
accelerated failure time models. Such models have been used in recent
studies investigating factors associated with fecundity and are preferred
due to improvements in interpretability and translation of risk estimates
(Gaskins et al., 2015). We utilized accelerated failure time models with log
normal distribution to estimate time ratios (TR) and 95% CIs. Alternative
distributions were investigated but the log normal distribution was selected
based on providing the lowest −2log likelihood and Akaike information cri-
terion value. These TRs can be interpreted as the ratios of the median
values of the duration of pregnancy attempts between the compared
groups. A TR above 1 implies that a given exposure is associated with long-
er TTP, whereas a TR below 1 indicates a shorter TTP.
The impact of differences in dietary intake on infertility (TTP >12 months)
was compared using a generalized linear model (Poisson distribution) with
robust variance estimates, with resulting relative risks (RR) and 95% CIs.
Tests for linear trend across categories of dietary intake were conducted
by including the dietary intake groups as ordinal variables into respective
models. We used causal diagrams (directed acyclic graphs) to guide selec-
tion of potential covariates for which to control, based on a priori selection
of covariates considered to impact dietary behavior and fertility.
Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of the
results, which were selected based on key potential sources of bias in
retrospective TTP studies (Joffe et al., 2005). Firstly, we investigated med-
ical intervention bias by restricting the analysis to couples who conceived
without the assistance of fertility treatments (n = 5258). Secondly, possible
truncation bias was corrected for by restricting the analysis to those with a
starting time between the second year and penultimate year of participant
recruitment at each site (n = 3645) to account for left and right truncation
bias, respectively (Joffe et al., 2005). Thirdly, we investigated the potential
for planning bias by restricting the analysis to couples who reported TTP of
>1 month (n = 3054).
Statistical significance was defined as a two-sided P-value of <0.05. All
statistical analyses were undertaken using STATA IC 14 (Stata, College
Station, TX, USA).

 reporting a median [IQR] TTP of 2.0 [1, 6] months. In total, 468 (8%)
couples took >12 months to conceive and 2204 (39%) reported a
TTP of 1 month or less.
Table I provides an overview of maternal and paternal characteris-
tics of the study population, separated by type of conception. The
mean (SD) age of women and men in the natural conception cohort
was ~5 years younger than the assisted conception cohort, whereas
maternal and paternal BMI were similar. Couples requiring assisted
conception did not have a materially different frequency of intake for
any of the food groups; however, there was a higher percentage of
women with PCOS, previous miscarriage, multivitamin intake, and
non-smokers, and a higher percentage of women not consuming
alcohol.
Pre-pregnancy diet and TTP
The relationship between pre-pregnancy diet and TTP is presented in
Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S1. Compared to women consuming
fruit ≥3 times/day, the fully adjusted TRs (95% CIs) were 1.06
(0.97–1.15) for intake ≥1–<3 times/day, 1.11 (1.01–1.22) for intake
1–6 times/week and 1.19 (1.03–1.36) for intake <1–3 times/month
(Ptrend = 0.007). Compared to women consuming fast food ≥4 times/
week, the fully adjusted TRs (95% CIs) were 0.89 (0.81–0.98) for
intake ≥2–<4 times/week, 0.79 (0.69–0.89) for intake >0–<2 times/
week and 0.76 (0.61–0.95) for no fast food (Ptrend = 0.001). No asso-
ciation was observed between intake of green leafy vegetables or fish
and TTP.
Marginal estimates for median TTP according to each category of
food intake are presented in Fig. 2. The adjusted difference in median
TTP was 0.2–0.6 months longer with decreasing levels of fruit intake
and 0.4–0.9 months shorter for decreasing levels of fast food intake.
In sensitivity analyses (Supplementary Table S1), risk estimates
remained stable following the exclusion of women with assisted con-
ception as well as following truncation. When restricting the analysis
to women reporting a TTP >1 month, risk estimates for fruit intake
became slightly attenuated, but not for the other food groups.
Pre-pregnancy diet and infertility
The relationship between pre-pregnancy diet and infertility is presented
in Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table S2. Compared to women consuming
fruit ≥3 times/day, the RR (95% CI) of infertility was 1.07 (0.88–1.29) for
women consuming fruit ≥1–<3 times/day, 1.18 (0.97–1.44) for intake
1–6 times/week, and 1.29 (0.95–1.74) for intake <1–3 times/month
(Ptrend = 0.043). Compared to women consuming fast food ≥4 times/
week, the fully adjusted RR of infertility were 0.82 (0.67–1.00) for women
consuming fast food ≥2–<4 times/week, 0.66 (0.51–0.85) for intake
>0–<2 times/week, and 0.59 (0.37–0.94) for no fast food (Ptrend =
0.001). No association was observed between intake of green leafy
vegetables or fish and infertility.
Marginal probability estimates for infertility according to each cat-
egory of food intake are presented in Fig. 4. For the entire cohort, esti-
mated probabilities of infertility based on multivariate adjusted models
corresponded to an absolute increase of 1–4% with decreasing levels
of fruit intake, and an absolute reduction of 3–8% for decreasing levels
of fast food intake.

 In sensitivity analyses (presented in Supplementary Table S2), the exclu-
sion of women with assisted conception resulted in larger effect estimates
for both fruit and fast food intake, as did truncating the cohort. In contrast,
estimates remained stable when restricting the analysis to women report-
ing a TTP >1 month, providing evidence against planning bias.
Discussion
In this pregnancy cohort, a lower intake of fruit and higher intake of
fast food were both associated with modest increases in TTP and
infertility. Absolute differences between the lowest and highest cat-
egories of intake for fruit and fast food were in the order of 0.6–0.9
months for TTP and 4–8% for infertility.
Research in pre-pregnancy diet and TTP in humans is sparse.
Factors that have been identified have generally been in couples under-
going fertility treatment, demonstrating a protective role with a healthy
dietary pattern or a Mediterranean dietary pattern, which includes
fruits, vegetables and fish (Chavarro et al., 2007; Vujkovic et al., 2010;
Twigt et al., 2012). This supports our findings of a protective effect of
fruit, but we did not find an association with green leafy vegetable or
fish. Fruits and vegetables contain a range of antioxidants and phyto-
chemicals, and these may beneficially impact fertility. As we only asked
about green leafy vegetables and did not ask about orange or other
types of vegetables, we did not capture total vegetable intake, poten-
tially limiting the impact they may have on fertility.
The specific dietary components of fast food and their relationship
to fertility have not been studied in human pregnancies. Fast foods are

 energy dense with high amounts of saturated fat, sodium and sugar.
One study showed saturated fats contribute 79% of the fatty acid
composition in oocytes of women undergoing IVF (Matorras et al.,
1998), while a higher concentration of saturated fatty acids or a higher
ratio of saturated to polyunsaturated fats in ovarian follicular fluid was
associated with reduced numbers of mature oocytes (Shaaker et al.,
2012). Studies in mice have shown that excess dietary fat intake
increased lipid content, and induced lipotoxicity and apoptosis in ovar-
ian cells (Wu et al., 2010). We speculate that a high intake of fast food
may be one factor mediating infertility through altered circulating and
oocyte follicular fluid metabolic markers, namely lipoproteins.
We acknowledge several strengths and limitations to this retrospect-
ive study. In general, retrospective TTP studies are complementary to
prospective TTP studies. Their major strength is their ability to achieve
a sample that is representative of the target population; that is, in com-
parison to prospective TTP studies that require recruitment of highly
motivated couples, introducing the potential for response and planning
bias, retrospective TTP studies have the advantage of providing greater
representativeness of the study sample to the target population (women
planning pregnancy), improving generalizability of study findings (Joffe
et al., 2005). Importantly, the use of retrospective self-reported TTP has
been shown to be a valid and reliable marker for TTP and has good
agreement to prospective recall (Joffe et al., 1993; Jukic et al., 2016). A
major strength of this study includes the large sample size, detailed collec-
tion of maternal and paternal factors, and information on method of con-
ception. Specific limitations include lack of information on menstrual cycle
length, simple assessment of dietary intake, and the possibility of residual

 confounding. TTP is considered easier to remember in retrospective
studies than cycle length (Olsen et al., 1997), and previous studies have
demonstrated that correcting for menstrual patterns had no impact on
effect estimates (Hassan and Killick, 2004).
Other limitations include that dietary intake was based on retro-
spective recall using a limited number of questions, thus some foods
may be misreported or missed. However, the practicality of using sin-
gle item questions, particularly fruit and vegetable intake, has been
demonstrated to be useful to assess gross level estimates and rank
individuals on intakes, rather than precise levels of intake (Yaroch
et al., 2012). Previous studies have also reported on fast food con-
sumption by single questions (French et al., 2000; Satia et al., 2004;
Jeffery et al., 2006; Dave et al., 2009), supporting the ability for such a
measure to adequately capture frequency of fast food intake.
Nevertheless, the reported intake of fast food is likely an underesti-
mate as we only captured intake at take-away restaurants and not at
home. Lastly, we did not collect dietary information from the male
partner, thus, we cannot determine the impact of paternal dietary
intake on the couple’s fertility leaving the possibility of residual con-
founding. A recent review on male diet and fertility markers indicated
that higher intake of fruits and vegetables was associated with
increased sperm motility whereas a higher intake of fat-rich foods and
sweets may decrease semen quality (Giahi et al., 2016); but further
investigation is required due to the small number of studies.
Further limitations are those inherent to retrospective TTP studies
and include the possibility of planning bias, medical intervention bias,
truncation bias and behavior change bias. These were all estimated to
bias risk estimates towards the null if they were present and our esti-
mates remained relatively stable across a number of sensitivity ana-
lyses. A more detailed description of these limitations and their
potential impacts on study results is provided in Supplemental Data.
Finally, the SCOPE cohort utilized in this study comprised healthy,
nulliparous women, specifically chosen for their low risk of pregnancy
complications. As such they were particularly fertile, with a reported
median TTP of 2 months. This is similar to some (Axmon et al., 2006;
Gesink Law et al., 2007; McKinnon et al., 2016), but shorter than other
(Gnoth et al., 2003; Ford et al., 2008) studies. The overall prevalence
of infertility was 8% which is comparable to the reported median
prevalence of 9% in developed and developing nations (Boivin et al.,
2007). Intake of the assessed food groups is also comparable to other
cohorts (Olsen and Secher, 2002; Murrin et al., 2007; Blumfield et al.,
2011), although it is difficult to precisely compare due to differences in
reporting of food intakes or grams of specific foods and/or food
groups. The study results are generalizable and have important impli-
cations for women of child bearing age who have a low intake of fruit
and a high intake of fast foods.
In conclusion, in a nulliparous population of women, a lower intake
of fruit and a higher intake of fast food in the preconception period
were both associated with a longer TTP and increased risk for infertil-
ity. Small modifications in dietary intake may have benefits for improv-
ing fertility and should be encouraged both population-wide and in
couples seeking conception. Further research is needed assessing a
broader range of foods and food groups prior to pregnancy.
