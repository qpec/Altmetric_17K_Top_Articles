abstract: One predicted cost of female infidelity in socially mo-
nogamous species is that cuckolded males should provide less parental
care. This relationship is robust across species, but evidence is ambig-
uous within species. We do not know whether individual males reduce
their care when paired with cheating females compared with when
paired with faithful females (within-male adjustment) or, alternatively,
if the males that pair with cheating females are the same males that
provide less parental care in general (between-male effect). Our excep-
tionally extensive long-term data set of repeated observations of a wild
passerine allows us to disentangle paternal care adjustment within
males—within pairs and between males—while accounting for envi-
ronmental variables. We found a within-male adjustment of paternal
provisioning, but not incubation effort, relative to the cuckoldry in
their nest. This effect was mainly driven by females differing consis-
tently in their fidelity. There was no evidence that this within-male ad-
justment also took place across broods with the same female, and we
found no between-male effect. Interestingly, males that gained more
extrapair paternity provided less care. Data from a cross-foster exper-
iment suggested that males did not use kin recognition to assess pater-
nity. Our results provide insight into the role of individual variation in
parental care and mating systems.

Introduction
The question of why females are unfaithful in socially mo-
nogamous species is currently the subject of a vibrant de-
bate (Forstmeier et al. 2014; Arct et al. 2015; Drobniak et al.
2015; Forstmeier 2015; Griffith 2015; Nakagawa et al. 2015;
Reid 2015). The theoretical predictions for female infidel-
ity are clear: females are expected to gain indirect fitness
benefits through higher genetic quality of the extrapair male,
better genetic compatibility with the extrapair male in com-
parison to the social mate, or fertility insurance (Griffith et al.
2002; Akçay and Roughgarden 2007). Extrapair matings are
thus expected to help to avoid inbreeding, improve genetic
diversity and immunocompetence, and ensure gamete fer-
tilization, all of which should enhance the fitness of the fe-
male and her offspring (Griffith et al. 2002). Despite these
theories, the empirical evidence for indirect benefits is con-
flicting (e.g., Møller and Alatalo 1999; Arnqvist and Kirk-
patrick 2005; Rosivall et al. 2009; Hsu et al. 2014; Bowers
et al. 2015). Meta-analyses have also provided conflicting
results for whether females gain fitness benefits from having
extrapair offspring (EPO; Akçay and Roughgarden 2007;
Arct et al. 2015) and even suggest that female infidelity is
costly (Hsu et al. 2015). To further our understanding of
the evolution of female polygamy, it is crucial to understand
not only the benefits but also the costs of females produc-
ing EPO (Nakagawa et al. 2015). One such cost could be re-
duced parental care by the cuckolded male (Burke et al.
1989). For example, in male reed buntings (Emberiza schoe-
niclus), provisioning was positively correlated with pater-
nity in his brood (Dixon et al. 1994).
Parental investment is defined as costly behavior by adults
that increases the survival chances of the young (Trivers
1972; Royle et al. 2012). It follows that animals should in-
vest in costly parenting only if the fitness benefits outweigh
the costs. Thus, a parent’s optimal investment is expected
to be defined by the benefits for the offspring and the genetic
relatedness between the parent and offspring (Hamilton 1964).
Different theories make distinct predictions about how males
should optimize their care according to the number of EPO
in their current brood. Depending on the life history and

 ecology of the species, reduced care, no adjustment, or even
increased paternal care have all been predicted as reactions to
a change in the number of EPO (Kempenaers and Sheldon
1997; Whittingham and Dunn 2001; Holen and Johnstone
2007). The favored theory of how males should optimize
their parental investment with respect to being cuckolded is
that they should provide less care to a brood that contains
more EPO than to a brood of the same female that contains
no or fewer EPO—the paternal care adjustment hypothesis.
When females produce EPO (for a review, see Kem-
penaers and Schlicht 2010), males cannot know for certain
that all the offspring he cares for are genetically related
to him (certainty of paternity), unless he guards her com-
pletely during her fertile period (Birkhead and Møller 1998).
Therefore, when paternity is less certain and other mating
opportunities exist, males should invest less into parental
care(Maynard-Smith1977;Grafen1980).Thereisample em-
pirical evidence for such a negative relationship across spe-
cies between male care (paternal care in the following) and
the mating system (Griffin et al. 2013). However, it is unclear
whether individual males actively adjust their paternal in-
vestment according to the number of EPOs present in the
brood to which they are providing care. Many empirical data
have been gathered to solidify the paternal care–paternity re-
lationship in species ranging from insects to mammals, but
these studies have resulted in negative, positive, and no rela-
tionships (for a review and meta-analysis, see Alonzo 2010
and Griffin et al. 2013, respectively). One reason for this might
be that such correlations can arise from two biologically dis-
tinct mechanisms. First, males might adjust their paternal
care directly according to how faithful their partner is (within-
male adjustment hypothesis). Second, males may differ con-
sistently in how much parental care they provide, and in turn,
these males might pair nonrandomly with females that dif-
fer consistently in how faithful they are. This is repeatable phe-
notypic variation with assortative mating, or the between-
male effect hypothesis. In this case, the association between
paternal care and female fidelity might be the result of a non-
causal mechanism of assortative mating for quality. Distin-
guishing between these two hypotheses would be informative
about whether females pay for infidelity with reduced pa-
ternal care and further our understanding of the evolution
of mating systems and parental investment. Notably, if the
between-male effect hypothesis is supported, then this would
reduce the argument for infidelity being costly to females
and therefore also reduce the need to identify a counteract-
ing female benefit (Griffith et al. 2002; Akçay and Rough-
garden 2007; see also Forstmeier 2014; Hsu 2015; Nakagawa
et al. 2015).
For the within-male adjustment hypothesis to hold, the
assumption has to be made that males can assess and re-
spond to the paternity of their chicks (Burke et al. 1989).
Such a flexible adjustment requires the detection of small
changes in the probability of paternity, and the adjustment
might be suboptimal, especially if the assessment of cuck-
oldry is imperfect and based on cues other than a male’s
genetic relatedness to individual offspring (e.g., Burke et al.
1989; Davies et al. 1992). The ability of fathers to identify
their own offspring, while intriguing, has received very lit-
tle empirical support. Some birds, at least, have a sense of
smell (Steiger et al. 2008), and it may be possible that birds
can use this sense to discern kinship or genetic similarity
(Bonadonna and Sanz-Aguilar 2012; Krause et al. 2012).
The general consensus, however, is that parents are unable
to assess relatedness directly by any mechanism (Amo et al.
2014). Furthermore, even if birds can assess relatedness, it
has been suggested that this is unlikely to be precise enough
to adjust paternal care to the optimal level (Kempenaers
and Sheldon 1996; Krause et al. 2012). A likely and more
gradated cue for a male to assess his degree of paternity cer-
tainty is the behavior of his female during her fertile period,
for example, deviations in her pattern of presence or absence
(Kempenaers and Sheldon 1996). Furthermore, the assump-
tion that males can estimate and respond to their paternity
fails to consider the cost to males of assessing their paternity
and the potentially high risk of making wrong allocation
decisions. Therefore, to account for such costs, we predict
that males should follow a simple reaction norm to environ-
mental cues correlated with paternity—or to cues from the
partner—that suffice in guiding optimal parental care allo-
cation decisions for both sexes.
Below we (1) briefly reiterate the difficulty of testing the
paternal care adjustment hypotheses in observational data
and provide solutions for detailed hypotheses on how the
pattern can come about (Kempenaers and Sheldon 1996,
1997, 1998; Sheldon 2002). We then (2) provide a case study
in which we apply mixed models to revisit the relationship
between paternal care and paternity in a long-term data set
that is exceptionally well suited to distinguishing between
the hypotheses for paternal care adjustment.
The Problem
Any pattern found between paternal care and paternity
in raw data will not necessarily be informative about the
biological processes at play. The main reason for this is
that any trade-off happens at an individual level (within-
individual process; Stearns 1992), which needs to be ana-
lytically distinguished from any between-individual process
(fig. 1A–1C). Three hypotheses other than the within-male
adjustment and between-male effect hypotheses could also
explain an association among or within males between pa-
ternal care and paternity share in the brood: differences in
state within individual males, effects of the partner within
individual males, and environmental effects. We explain these
briefly below.

 Male State. There is within-male variation in flexible traits,
such as condition, health, experience, or traits that change
with age (Houston and McNamara 2002). Age, especially,
can covary with the quality of the female partner that a
male can secure, with the level of extrapair paternity (EPP)
in the brood, and, potentially, with the quality of paternal
care. For example, inexperienced males may be poorer at
mate guarding and be time constrained (Schwagmeyer et al.
2012). Thus, the female paired with such a male may gain
EPOs while, simultaneously, the male may not provide a
high level of paternal care. Extrapair sires are predominantly
older males (Wetton et al. 1991; Cleasby and Nakagawa
2012; Hsu et al. 2015), which could mean that correlated
differences in parental investment between males with and
without EPP could indirectly be driven by male age. Several
studies have shown that older males are better at obtaining
EPPs and also invest more into paternal care than younger
males (Kempenaers and Sheldon 1997; Houston and Mc-
Namara 2002; Velando et al. 2006; Hammers et al. 2012).
Thus, age alone as a flexible male state might potentially
drive any association between paternal care and paternity.
To test for this mechanism, one needs to analyze longitudi-
nal data with repeated measures for within-male patterns,
accounting for age.
Effects of the Partner. Males might adjust their contri-
bution to care according to the individual quality of their
partnered female (differential allocation hypothesis; Shel-

Paternal Care and Paternity Revisited

 don 2000; Pilastro et al. 2003; Matessi et al. 2009; Morales
et al. 2009). If females differ consistently in the number of
EPO in their broods, and the quantity of EPO is associated
with individual quality (Forstmeier et al. 2011), then a mis-
leading association with paternal care can result (fig. 1D).
A male paired up with a low-quality female might be less
likely to invest into the brood (fig. 1E) and instead use their
resources in seeking opportunities to gain EPP elsewhere
(Kokko and Jennions 2008). Current condition and thus
the value of the female to the male may be phenotypically
flexible and signaled by, for instance, her age, health status,
or another trait. Any such effect might cause an apparent
association between paternal care and EPP (Alonzo 2010).
Males might, however, keep their level of care constant within
a pair but not when changing partners (fig. 1C), because
such consistent behavior might encourage mate retention
and thus increase a male’s chances of future reproductive
success (Sheldon 2000; Servedio et al. 2013). Such a system,
where males decide about their investment and stick with
their decision throughout the reproductive bout or pair
bond, is termed a sealed bid (Houston et al. 2005). To test
whether individual males adjust their allocation of resources
in repeated breeding attempts between different partners or
within the same partner, depending on the individual qual-
ity and state of their partner, one needs repeated measures
of males paired with different females.
Environmental Variables. Environmental stochasticity may
affect both EPP and paternal care through, for instance,
food availability (Schwagmeyer et al. 2012). Changes in en-
vironmental variables across a season might lead to an ap-
parent association of EPP with paternal care (fig. 1F, 1G)
across successive broods (Kempenaers and Sheldon 1997).
The need for a study that can distinguish these hypoth-
eses was highlighted nearly 2 decades ago (Kempenaers
and Sheldon 1997; Sheldon 2002). We can only start to re-
veal the actual costs of infidelity for females and better un-
derstand the evolution of mating systems, monogamy, and
parental care once we know whether within-male adjust-
ment relative to EPP is a biological reality (Griffin et al.
2013). Only experimentally induced EPP would allow us to
test directly the parental care adjustment hypothesis and to
assess the costs of female infidelity. Such experiments are
difficult to achieve because their design is inherently limited
to those cues that males can detect and use to make alloca-
tion decisions. Therefore, such experiments could be se-
verely confounded. Without prior knowledge about corre-
lational relationships, it is unclear if and how experiments
for causation between paternal care and paternity should be
conducted.
Analyzing patterns in repeated measures can achieve a
better understanding of the associations between paternity
and paternal care within and between males. To test for
within-male adjustment, one needs repeated measures of
the same males in broods that contain different levels of
EPO (Dixon et al. 1994). The published studies with such
a design are surprisingly scarce and have very small sample
sizes with repeated measures, ranging from N p 5 (Wil-
liams and Hale 2008) to a maximum of N p 27 (Westneat
2001). A correlational approach with high statistical power—
and that handles the caveats discussed above—is therefore
timely.
Case Study
Here, we test the paternal care adjustment hypothesis, us-
ing a data set from house sparrows (Passer domesticus).
Paternal care in house sparrows is linked with direct fit-
ness benefits: chicks that receive more paternal care from
their social father have a higher annual and lifetime fitness
(Schroeder et al. 2013). Thus, even a partial reduction in
paternal care would likely incur fitness costs to female spar-
rows. Our data set contains repeated measures of parental
care from 200 males. House sparrows breed multiple times
a year and often change social partners. For the first time,
this data set allows us to disentangle within-male paternal
care adjustment from between-male effects, while account-
ing for environmental variables. We then continue to dis-
tinguish whether the within-male adjustment takes place
within or between pairs.
Material and Methods
Paternal Care Data
We used data from a natural house sparrow population
breeding on Lundy Island (517100N, 47400W; Cleasby et al.
2011). When captured, birds were marked with a metal ring
from the British Trust for Ornithology and an individ-
ual color ring combination. We also equipped birds with
passive-integrated transponders (Schroeder et al. 2011b). We
identified individuals attending a nest box by their unique
color ring combination, by direct observations, or by video
recordings made specifically for this purpose (Nakagawa
et al. 2007; Schroeder et al. 2013). We also identified par-
ents with nest box antennae, permanently installed on some
nest boxes, that detect the presence and unique identifica-
tion (ID) of the passive-integrated transponder of a bird
when it enters the nest box (Schroeder et al. 2011b). We
used data on two measures of parental care—incubation
and provisioning behavior—from the years 2004–2012. We
placed video cameras on the ground in front of the nest
boxes, such that the field of view included a 30-cm radius
around the nest box, and recorded for 90 min (Nakagawa
et al. 2007). The numbers of eggs and chicks were counted.
We used only that part of the video from the moment

 when the first bird returned to the nest, in order to avoid
latency artifacts from birds being scared of the camera
(Nakagawa et al. 2007). This resulted in most videos being
slightly shorter than 90 min (mean recording time 5 SD:
incubation: 88:3 5 7:44 min, N p 1,199 on 652 broods;
nestling provisioning: 88:3 5 6:53 min, N p 1,430 on 661
broods; note that the identical values for the mean record-
ing times are a coincidence).
Incubation behavior was scored when a breeding bird
had spent at least 1 min in the nest box. We used the time
(min h21) a male spent incubating as a measure of paternal
incubation care. Provisioning behavior was scored when a
bird either entered the nest box in which there were chicks
present or fed chicks from outside the nest box. We used
the number of visits (visits h21) of a male to his nest box as
a measure of paternal care in the form of nestling provi-
sioning. For more details on methods of parental care data
collection, see Nakagawa et al. (2007) and Schroeder et al.
(2013). Provisioning observations took place on broods that
were cross-fostered at day 2 after hatching (N p 937 obser-
vations on 416 broods) and on broods that did not expe-
rience any cross-fostering treatment (N p 493 observations
on 245 broods). Data are deposited in the Dryad Digital
Repository: http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.0t313 (Schroeder
et al. 2016).
Extrapair Paternity
We sampled DNA from nearly every fledged sparrow caught
on Lundy, which we then genotyped at 13 polymorphic
microsatellite loci (Schroeder et al. 2011a; Hsu et al. 2015).
The usefulness of these loci for parentage analysis is doc-
umented elsewhere (Dawson et al. 2012). With these data,
we determined the genetic ancestry of every genotyped bird
and calculated the number of EPO in each brood (Hsu et al.
2014). We then calculated the ratio of EPO to all genotyped
offspring from each original brood. Typically, in each year,
99% of chicks that survived past the age of 2 days were
genotyped and assigned paternity (Schroeder et al. 2011a).
Overall, from 2000 to 2012, we assigned paternity to more
than 96% of chicks that were alive as hatchlings (Hsu et al.
2015).
Statistical Analyses
First, we tested whether there was variation in EPO among
and within males, females, and pairs by calculating the re-
peatability of the proportion of EPO among males (male
ID), among females (female ID), and among unique parent-
pairs (pair ID). The repeatability is a measure of the pro-
portion of variance in a trait explained by within-subject
consistency and between-subject variation. We modeled
the number of EPO and WPO in a generalized linear mixed
model (GLMM) with no fixed effects and with male ID in
a first model, pair ID in a second model, and female ID in
a third model as the respective single random effect on the
intercept:
pij p logit21(1 1 ai 1 εij),
ð1Þ
where pij is the underlying (latent) probability of being an
EPO for the ith chick of the jth male (or, in the second
analysis, pair). The intercept is set to one on the link scale,
ai is the random effect (i.e., male ID, pair ID, or female ID)
with a variance of j2
a, and εij is the residual (additive over-
dispersion) term on the link scale with a variance of j2
ε. We
calculated the link-scale repeatability, following Nakagawa
and Schielzeth (2010), as

Within-Male Adjustment versus Between-Male Effect. We
tested for within-male adjustment for whether a male pro-
vided less care to a brood containing more EPO than one
with fewer EPO. We used within-subject centering, using
GLMMs (van de Pol and Wright 2009). For both incuba-
tion and nestling visits, we modeled the identity of the male
(male ID) as a random intercept, which accounts for
between-male variance (differences between males). We then
used two fixed predictors: one to estimate the within-male
adjustment (within-male adjustment) to beingcuckolded (W
m)
and one for the between-male (Bm) effect of being cuckolded.
To estimate W
m, we subtracted the average frequency of
EPO for the focal male (between-male effect; Bm) from each
individual observation of the focal male:
Wm p xijk 2 �
xj,
ð3Þ
Bm p �
xj,
ð4Þ
where xijk is the ith observation on individual j of pair k.
We modeled both response variables (incubation be-
havior and provisioning) with the same model structure
(W
m and Bm) and added the following fixed and random
effects because of their biological relevance: we know that
the age of the chicks (chick age), the number of chicks in
the brood (clutch size), and the day of the year each affect
paternal care, and we therefore center-scaled these and added
them to the model as covariates (Westneat et al. 2011). We
have shown before that the time of day did not statistically
significantly affect the frequency of nestling visits; therefore,
we did not add this covariate to the model (Schroeder et al.
2013). We added year and the brood identity (brood ID)
as random effects to account for annual stochasticity and
pseudoreplication. Incubation time was modeled with Gauss-

 ian errors, and nestling visits were modeled as counts (h21)
with a Poisson error distribution.
Effect of the Partner. We found within-male adjustment:
males adjust their provisioning behavior—but not incubation
behavior—according to the extrapair offspring their part-
ners produced. We subsequently wanted to know whether
this within-male adjustment was due to different partners
producing different numbers of EPO, due to the same partner
producing different numbers of EPO in successive broods
with the same male, or both. We constructed another GLMM
with provisioning behavior as the response variable. Male
birds were nested in pairs, which differed from each other
by the different identity of the female partner, adding one
hierarchically nested layer to the model (i.e., male ID fitted
as a cross-classified random effect within pairs). We used
three fixed covariates to model variation within males within
pairs (W
mp), within males but between pairs (W
mBp), and
between males (Bm; eq. [4]):
Wmp p (x 2 �
xj) 2 (xijk 2 �
xj)k,
ð5Þ
where W
mp excludes any between-male variation and tests
only for an effect that takes place within pairs and within
males;
WmBp p (xijk 2 �
xj)k,
ð6Þ
where W
mBp excludes between-male variation and tests for
an effect between pairs but within males. We also added
clutch size and chick age as covariates. In addition to bird
ID, year, and brood ID, pair ID was added as a random ef-
fect to account for correlated data structures. Subject cen-
tering has the potential to be biased, especially if used on
small data sets (Phillimore et al. 2010). Our data set is rel-
atively large; however, we tested the robustness of our re-
sults by running bivariate GLMMs, which provide unbiased
results (Phillimore et al. 2010), in which we assessed the
variance-covariance matrices. These models returned qual-
itatively similar results.
Male State. We tested whether males adjusted their provi-
sioning rate differently over the course of their life span.
We used the model described under effect of the partner
and added a covariate of male age (age) and an interaction
of age with W
mBp, since W
mBp was the level on which we
found a statistically significant within-male adjustment ef-
fect. We also tested for an interaction of a squared effect
of male age with W
mBp to account for nonlinear changes
with age. We then tested whether there was an association
with the adjustment males made and the number of EPO
this male gained in the year (EPO gain). Therefore, we added
an interaction of EPO gain with W
mBp to the model.
Environmental Effects. We then tested whether changes in
the environment affected the within-male paternal care ad-
justments. Males might adjust their behavior according to
food availability, which can vary over the course of a sea-
son. We therefore added day of the year as a continuous
linear predictor and also tested an interaction of day with
W
mBp. We modeled whether the brood order affected pa-
ternal care by adding brood number (numbered within pairs
consecutively within a year) as a covariate to the model and
an interaction of it with W
mBp. We considered whether a
brood was cross-fostered in this analysis, because even al-
though we consider it unlikely, cross-fostering could affect
our results if males were able to assess their kinship to the
offspring they cared for. We added the two-level factor fos-
tered as an environmental variable to this model and an in-
teraction of it with W
mBp to test whether the within-male ad-
justment changed, depending on the degree of kinship with
the cared-for offspring. If we were to find an effect here, this
analysis could suggest that males may be able to assess and
adjust to genetic relatedness to the nest they care for (but
see discussion).
We used MCMCglmm (ver. 2.19) in R (ver. 3.10; R Devel-
opment Core Team 2015) to calculate parameter estimates
and 95% credibility intervals (CIs; Hadfield 2010). We con-
sidered fixed effects as statistically significant when their 95%
CI did not span 0. We mention minimum probability values
(MCMC-P) to describe nonsignificant results. These refer to
pMCMC as calculated in MCMCglmm, which is twice the
MCMC estimate of the probability that the 95% CI does
not span 0 and can therefore be interpreted in a similar
way to traditional P values.
Results
We found EPO in 38% of nests (for more details on EPO
in the Lundy population, see Hsu et al. (2014, 2015).
Incubation
Most incubation observations (N p 863) were collected be-
tween days 9 and 12 after the first egg was laid; some were
collected earlier or later (before day 9: N p 197; after day 14:
N p 95). We scored incubation behavior for 186 different
male sparrows at 652 broods; for 161 of those males, we have
repeated observations for a total of 634 broods. In the incu-
bation data set, there was variation in EPP within and
among males (among-male variance in an intercept-only
model: 1.03 [95% CI p 0.47–1.61]; within-male variance:
1.32 [95% CI p 0.74–1.92]). In the incubation data set, the
link-scale repeatability of being cuckolded for males overall
was RL p 18% (95% CI p 9%–27%). There was variation
in the presence EPP in a brood within and among pairs
(among pairs: 1.44 [95% CI p 0.69–2.13]), and the link-

 scale repeatability was RL p 26% (95% CI p 15%–35%).
This data set contained information on 194 females. There
was also variation in infidelity (the presence of EPP in the
brood) within and among females (among-female variance:
1.05 [95% CI p 0.49–1.69]; within-female variance: 1.39
[95% CI p 0.77–2.01]), and the link-scale repeatability
was RL p 17% (95% CI p 10%–27%). Male incubation de-
creased slightly with clutch size (table 1). Male incubation time
was not associated with the number of EPO in the brood (ta-
ble 1); we did not therefore proceed further with the analyses
on male incubation time.
Nestling Provisioning
Observations of nest box visits (N p 1,430) were mostly
collected on days 7 (N p 564) and 11 (N p 496) after
the chicks hatched. However, the full data set of observa-
tions used in this analysis spans the entire nestling period.
The data set on nestling provisioning comprised observa-
tions of parental care by 207 male sparrows, caring for 661
different broods. Two hundred males (97%) were observed
more than once. We had five or more observations for 121
individual males (50%). Of all males, 76% were observed at
more than one brood and 53% were observed at three or
more broods; 57% (118) were observed at multiple broods
with variation in the number of EPO. There was variation
in the degree of cuckoldry experienced both within and
among males (among-male variance in an intercept-only
model: 1.09 [95% CI p 0.45–1.69]; within-male variance:
1.38 [95% CI p 0.78–1.97]). The link-scale repeatability of
EPP for males was RL p 19% (95% CI p 9%–27%). We also
assessed the variation in EPP between unique parent-pair
combinations. Of all 313 unique pairs, 126 pairs (40%, includ-
ing 37% of males, or 77 individuals) had at least two broods
that varied in the number of EPO. There was variation in
the presence of EPO in a brood among (1.41 [95% CI p
0.67–2.17]) and within (1.11 [95% CI p 0.45–1.76]) pairs.
The link-scale repeatability of the presence of EPO among
pairs was RL p 24% (95% CI p 13%–34%). There were
204 unique females in the data set and variation in the num-
ber of offspring resulting from EPP within and among fe-
males (among-female variance in an intercept-only model:
2.34 [95% CI p 1.62–3.18]; within-female variance: 0.63
[95% CI p 0.37–0.88]). The link-scale repeatability of EPP
among females was RL p 38% (95% CI p 29%–45%).
Within-Male Adjustment versus Between-Male Effect. We
found within-male adjustment: individual males visited nests
with a lower frequency when there were more extrapair off-
spring in their brood (table 1). Back-transforming the esti-
mate revealed that with an increase of 1 SD in EPO in the nest
(which corresponds roughly to one EPO offspring in a brood
of four), males reduced their paternal care by 1.15 times
the standard deviation in paternal care. The parameter esti-
mate for the between-male effect was not statistically signif-
icant but was similar in direction. The difference between
the between- and within-male slopes was not statistically sig-
nificant because the 95% CIs overlapped.
Effect of the Partner. We found that individual males signif-
icantly adjusted their paternal care between pairs (WmBp) by
a magnitude similar to that reported above (back-transformed:
1.15 SD). The point estimates for the parameters within
males within pairs—as well as for between males—were

 negative, but the 95% CI did span 0 (Wmp and Bm; fig. 2).
The 95% CIs of these estimates overlapped.
Male State. We detected a statistically significant interac-
tion of the within-male adjustment (WmBp) with the num-
ber of EPO a male gained with other females (fig. 3). Thus,
a male’s loss of paternity to cuckoldry and his gains from
EPP had more than additive negative effects on paternal
care. For each standard deviation by which males gained
EPP (roughly one chick), they reduced their paternal care
by 1 SD. We found that the 95% CIs of the interactions of
the adjustment with the age of the male or its squared age
all overlapped 0; thus, we removed these terms from the fi-
nal model presented in figure 3.
Environmental Effects. We found that males did not adjust
paternal care relative to any of the environmental covar-
iates. Specifically, neither the main effect nor the interaction
of whether a brood received unrelated foster offspring (fos-
tered) with W
mBp was statistically significant; thus, we re-
moved these environmental covariates from the final model.
The 95% CI of the interaction of W
mBp with brood order and
the interaction of W
mBp with day both overlapped with 0 and
so were also removed from the final model.
Finally, we detected considerable negative covariation
between the probability of the male being cuckolded and
the age of a male but no significant effects between males
of different ages (GLMM with being cuckolded as the re-
sponse variable, effects of within- and between-male age as
covariates, and male ID as a random effect; parameter
estimates b and 95% CI of a Poisson GLMM, responses
scaled: bintercept: 20.76 [20.92 to 20.61]; bbetween-male age: 0.12
[20.03 to 0.28]; bwithin-male age: 20.07 [20.12 to 20.04]; jmale ID:
1.07 [0.77 to 1.33]; jresidual: 0.004 [0.00 to 0.006]). The dif-
ference between the between- and within-male age effects
was statistically significant, since their 95% CIs did not over-
lap. Thus, with each standard deviation of increasing age
(1.4 years), individual males had roughly 1.6 fewer cuckolded
chicks to care for.
Discussion
We have used an exceptionally extensive data set with many
repeated observations to improve our understanding of the
consequences of female infidelity on male paternal care. We
found no evidence for a between-male effect. However, we
found support for within-male adjustment of parental care to
extrapair paternity in the brood. Individual male house spar-
rows changed the frequency with which they paid feeding
visits to the nest when their female partner subjected them
to different degrees of cuckoldry. Females showed moderate
to high repeatability in the proportion of offspring in their
brood that were sired by extrapair males. Therefore, most
within-male adjustment of paternal care occurred when the

 males changed mates. There was no change of within-male
adjustment when the brood received unrelated foster off-
spring or not. Therefore, male sparrows do not use a direct
cue about their relatedness to the offspring in the brood to
decide how much care to deliver. However, note that this is
not a comprehensive test for whether males can discern kin-
ship because they might use a different cue to adjust pater-
nal care (Kempenaers and Sheldon 1996). We did not find
between-male effects or within-male adjustment for incuba-
tion behavior, perhaps because incubation activities invoke
different constraints than provisioning behavior. For instance,
there may be sex differences in how the workload is shared
between the pair members. Other reasons might be that there
are severe consequences to eggs if they are not attended reg-
ularly or that incubating eggs might not be as costly as provi-
sioning young, so that the cost of adjusting this effort might
not be worth the benefit.
Our findings suggest that the majority of within-male
paternal care adjustment was in response to the identity of
the individual female with which a male was paired. This
may reflect a within-male adjustment to differences in fe-
male quality (Alonzo 2010; Wilson and Nussey 2010). This
suggestion is important because it challenges the general as-
sumption that males dynamically optimize their reproduc-
tive investment for a given brood, using strict economical
calculations based on the brood’s value. Here, the brood’s
value may be less defined by its relatedness to the male
and more by the individual traits of the female. Males might
use female identity—or an unknown cue that is linked to
her identity—to make decisions about their parental invest-
ment (Houston et al. 2005). Our results support the idea
that birds with biparental care, such as the house sparrow,
use a sealed-bid model, at least within a pair, to determine
how much to invest into a brood (Schwagmeyer et al. 2002).
It is possible that sparrows adjust to changes in the extra-
pair rate when staying with the same partner but that we
could not detect such an effect; this could be partly due
to females showing relatively consistent extrapair behavior.
A sealed bid cannot be precisely optimized and will inevita-
bly lead to variation in paternal care. The level of the sealed
bid is not often specified and is generally assumed to hap-
pen within a pair—that the bid stays sealed as long as a pair

Paternal Care and Paternity Revisited

 stays together—but not between pairs; our results support
this assumption.
Our results suggest that females vary consistently in
their infidelity, and it is possible that this is associated with
variation in other female traits (Forstmeier et al. 2014).
We do not know what cues males use to assess female iden-
tity and adjust paternal care accordingly. If female infidelity
is advertised, or correlated with an unknown cue, males
could use that to adjust their behavior. Our results warrant
more research into these interacting effects between female
and male behavior in a pair. Such interacting within-male
effects between mating partners are likely to be frequent
and have the power to challenge our traditional models about
sexual conflict, mate choice, and parental care (Westneat
and Stewart 2003; Alonzo 2010; Lehtonen and Kokko 2015)
but have not often been investigated (Alonzo and Heckman
2009).
The costs of caring for unrelated young are obvious. For
instance, in house sparrows, any risk of reduced paternal
care is costly because males who care less raise fewer re-
cruits annually and over a lifetime (Schroeder et al. 2013).
However, the possible benefit to males of raising unrelated
young may be more difficult to assess and is therefore not
often considered. Aspects of a female’s quality may be cor-
related with her propensity to obtain extrapair matings and
produce EPO (e.g., Rosivall et al. 2009). In this case, females
of high quality who also have high levels of EPO might pro-
vide direct or genetic benefits that outweigh the cost to the
male of being cuckolded. In this scenario, paternal care could
serve as a signal of a male’s quality and be the object of fe-
male choice. Furthermore, since the costs of remating could
be high (M. J. P. Simons, I. Winney, Y.-H. Hsu, J. Schroeder,
S. Nakagawa, and T. Burke, unpublished manuscript), it may
be beneficial for a male to care for unrelated young rather
than risk losing a high-quality mate (Schwagmeyer et al.
2012). We also found that the within-male paternal care
adjustment to brood EPO levels was associated with how
many EPO a male himself sired. This pattern suggests that
time or other resource constraints may govern extrapair be-
havior, and extrapair activities, in turn, may limit how much
care a male can give to his social brood (Schwagmeyer et al.
2012).
The traditional models that aim to explain why females
engage in extrapair behavior have recently been questioned
(Forstmeier et al. 2014; Hsu et al. 2014; Nakagawa et al.
2015), because empirical data do not support the idea that
females choose a higher-quality extrapair mate to make up
for deficiencies in her social mate—whether to gain good
genes, better matching genes, or indirect benefits—all be-
tween male effects (Arnqvist and Kirkpatrick 2005; Hsu
et al. 2014, 2015). New theory is based on the finding that
extrapair males are mostly older males (Cleasby and Naka-
gawa 2012; Hsu et al. 2015). Thus, male age is associated
with EPP, through a mechanism whereby a male’s ability
to gain paternity improves with age or where monogamous
males selectively die younger. Male age could be associated
with within-male changes in behavior that lead to improved
mating success through coercion, through an improved abil-
ity to convince females, or through postcopulatory sperm
competition. The latter—albeit speculative—idea is sup-
ported by our finding that males lose fewer paternities to
extrapair sires as they age and also predicts that older males
in general gain more paternities—extra- and within-pair—
which previously has indeed often been observed (Cleasby
and Nakagawa 2012). The idea that old males gain more
EPP through behavioral or physiological changes with age
has been coined the sugar-free daddy hypothesis—old males
gaining extrapair matings but not contributing any benefits
to their female (Nakagawa et al. 2015). One major differ-
ences between the so-called adaptive (good genes, genetic
matching, indirect benefits) and the nonadaptive (sugar-
free daddy) hypotheses is that the latter considers changes
within individual males, while the former considers differ-
ences between males. This highlights the value and need
of studies distinguishing within-individual male effects from
between-male effects through repeated observations of indi-
viduals.
Our results prompt the question of whether a female’s
EPO strategy is fixed within pairs and between social mat-
ing partners. However, the costs and benefits of such a fe-
male extrapair mating strategy clearly need to be revisited,
because it would incur costs to the female not only in terms
of the fitness of the offspring (Hsu et al. 2014; Schroeder
et al. 2015) but also in terms of reduced parental care by
her social mate (this study).
In conclusion, the within-male adjustment of paternal
care does not appear to be a dynamic response to the num-
ber of extrapair offspring in the brood but, rather, a response
to mate quality in a sealed-bid manner within pairings. We
find no evidence for a between-male effect. Our findings up-
date the assessment of the costs of female extrapair behav-
ior in terms of paternal care. This assessment is needed to
estimate the costs and benefits of female infidelity—basic
requirements for understanding the evolution of mating
systems, monogamy, and parental care.
