A trade-off between cognitive and 
physical performance, with relative 
preservation of brain function
Daniel Longman1, Jay T. Stock1,2 & Jonathan C. K. Wells3
Debate surrounds the issue of how the large, metabolically expensive brains of Homo sapiens can be 
energetically afforded. At the evolutionary level, decreased investment in muscularity, adiposity and 
the digestive tract allow for a larger brain. Developmentally, high neo-natal adiposity and preferential 
distribution of resources to the brain provide an energetic buffer during times of environmental stress. 
Through an experimental design, we investigated the hypothesis of a trade-off involving brain and 
muscle at the acute level in humans. Mental performance was measured by a free-recall test, and 
physical performance by power output on an indoor rowing ergometer. Sixty-two male student rowers 
performed the two tests in isolation, and then again simultaneously. Paired samples t-tests revealed 
that both power output and mental performance reduced when tested together compared to in 
isolation (t(61) = 9.699, p < 0.001 and t(61) = 8.975, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the decrease in physical 
performance was greater than the decrease in mental performance (t(61) = −2.069, p = 0.043). This 
is the first investigation to demonstrate an acute level trade-off between these two functions, and 
provides support for the selfish brain hypothesis due to the relative preservation of cognitive function 
over physical power output. The underlying mechanism is unclear, and requires further work.
Evolutionary and developmental implications of enhanced encephalization. 
The development 
of an enlarged and elaborated brain is considered a defining characteristic of human evolution1. The evolution of 
the Homo clade has been accompanied by significant encephalization2,3. This facilitated the development of more 
complex social strategies4,5, more effective food acquisition6 and the ability to solve ecological problems through 
innovative means7. Each of these characteristics may have increased survival and reproductive success, giving a 
greater life expectancy at the age of first reproduction8.
While the benefits of encephalization are numerous, the brain imposes significant metabolic costs on both the 
individual9–11. High levels of energetic expenditure are necessitated by the brain’s responsibility for regulating the 
body’s energy supply and controlling the function of many peripheral organs12. These functions require intense 
neuronal activity, giving the brain the highest metabolic demand relative to size of all organs13.
The question of how larger brains can be metabolically afforded has remained a prominent problem in human 
evolution11,14–17. Life history theory states that as energy availability is finite, an organism has a limited energy 
budget. Energy allocated to one function cannot be used for another. Energy savings in other organs or tissues 
could allow for energetic diversion to the brain, without the need to increase overall metabolic expenditure11,18. 
Such a trade-off has been proposed with both digestive tract development17 and adiposity19.
Meeting the brain’s metabolic requirements. 
The immediate metabolic costs of the brain depend on its 
activation state. While the metabolic rate is low during sleep20 increased energy consumption has been observed 
in response to a mental task21, and following somatosensory, olfactory, visual and auditory stimulation22–27. The 
adult brain almost exclusively derives its energy from the metabolism of glucose28. This, coupled with its high 
energetic demand, ensure that the brain metabolises the most glucose of any organ29,30. The brain, however, is 
unable to store significant amounts of energy and hence buffer its high yet variable metabolic demand31. As such, 
the body is required to supply glucose to the brain quickly and effectively. The ‘Selfish Brain Hypothesis’12 posits 
that the brain prioritises its own glucose needs over those of the peripheral organs, such as skeletal muscle.

Skeletal muscle and encephalization. 
Skeletal muscle mass is an expensive tissue to maintain, account-
ing for approximately 20% of human male BMR32,33, and may be compromised to partially offset the brain’s high 
energy costs11,34. An adaptation to reduce muscle mass would thereby reduce metabolic demand, allowing for a 
reallocation of energy towards the central nervous system35. The glucose demands of skeletal muscle also increase 
significantly with activation36–40. In such circumstances, skeletal muscle thereby becomes a powerful competitor 
of the brain for glucose and oxygen41.
High intensity exercise increases the metabolic demand of skeletal muscles and the brain39,40,42–45, in propor-
tion to degree of activation. At high levels of activation both are reliant upon glucose metabolism, and require a 
high rate of oxygen and glucose supply. Should both be challenged simultaneously, competition for these valuable 
yet limited resources may therefore develop, with one or both organs receiving an insufficient supply for optimal 
performance.
The concept of an antagonistic relationship between capacity to perform mental and physical work is not a 
new one46. As described by the idea of central fatigue, prior mental exertion may impair subsequent physical 
performance47.
Despite the intuitive appeal of a trade-off between two competing functions, negative covariance in such 
traits are not frequently observed when phenotypic comparisons are made between individuals within a popu-
lation48,49. This study seeks to experimentally investigate the possibility of a trade-off involving the brain at the 
acute, rather than at the evolutionary or developmental, level. It is hypothesised that, when both systems are 
challenged simultaneously, performance will be inferior to performance when each are challenged in isolation. 
It is further hypothesised that the relative decrease in muscle power output will exceed the relative decrease in 
cognitive function.
Results
A description of the samples is given in Table 1. Significant positive correlations were observed between rowing 
power output in both Protocols A and C (r = 0.484, p < 0.001), as well as recall performance in both Protocols B 
and C (r = 0.758, p < 0.001). This suggests that participants who row fast or recall many words do so irrespective 
of condition. Table 2 reports the correlation matrix (Pearsons product-moment correlation coefficients), with 
a significant negative correlation was observed between rowing power output in Protocol A and Δ
power from 
Protocol A to C (r = −
0.343, p = 0.006). No correlation was also observed between recall performance in Protocol 
B and Δ
recall from Protocol B to C (r = −
0.203, p = 0.113). This suggests that highly performing participants in 
Protocols A and B exhibit the greatest decline in performance when both tasks are performed together in Protocol 
C.
Paired samples t-tests revealed that power output (W) was significantly lower in Protocol C than in Protocol 
A (Protocol A M = 389.93, SD = 34.819; Protocol C M = 340.20, SD = 43.321; t(61) = 9.699, p < 0.001). Similarly, 
recall (correct words) was significantly lower in Protocol C than in Protocol B (Protocol B M = 29.11, SD = 3.339; 
Protocol C M = 26.27, SD = 3.738; t(61) = 8.975, p < 0.001). The percentage change in recall between Protocols 
B and C was significantly less than the percentage change in power output between Protocol A and C (Δ
recall 
M = −
9.6740, SD = 8.62756; Δ
power output M = −
12.5535, SD = 9.81460, t(61) = −
2.069, p = 0.043), see Fig. 1.
Discussion
We proposed that the simultaneous challenge of both cognitive and physical faculties would result in impaired 
performance in each task, compared to performance achieved when in isolation. This hypothesis has been sup-
ported. The observation that both tasks cannot be performed optimally at the same time suggests that a trade-off 
between mental and physical function does indeed exist. The secondary hypothesis was supported as concurrent 
challenge differentially affected each task; the decrease in brain function was significantly less than that of power 
output.

Preferential allocation of glucose to the brain may be an evolved trait; a well-fuelled brain may offer bet-
ter survival odds than well-fuelled muscles when facing an environmental challenge31. In such a situation, the 
body is able to buffer a muscle-fuel deficit by increasing supply of free fatty acids to fuel skeletal muscles50,51. 
High intensity physical activity considerably increases the metabolic needs of both the brain and skeletal mus-
cle28,38–40,42–44,52. Competition for a limited supply of blood glucose and oxygen is a potential mechanism account-
ing for the fast-acting trade-off in brain and muscle function demonstrated here. The occurrence of glycogen 
supercompensation in the brain, as well as in skeletal muscles following exhaustive exercise, provides further 
support for this explanation53.
Although the brain is normally dependent upon glucose for energy, it may also utilise the lactate produced 
by skeletal muscles during exercise. The brain takes up lactate in proportion to its arterial concentration, which 
increases with exercise intensity. This increased lactate utilisation contributes to the meeting of high cerebral 
energy demands, which result from increased neuronal activity during high intensity exercise54. The preferential 
uptake of lactate as the predominant oxidative substrate of neurones55 has the effect of sparing glucose56. However, 
our results suggest that substrate competition between the brain and skeletal muscles is significant despite this.
Life history theory describes the competitive allocation of limited resources between physiological functions 
during development57–60. The optimal physiological distribution is determined by both the individual’s life stage61 
and environment62,63, and is achieved through phenotypic plasticity64. Hales & Barker extended life history theory 
to consider trade-offs between organs and tissues, such as brain and muscle, by proposing that nutritional stress 
during early development leads to certain tissues being prioritised over others65. This tactic allows the organism 
to endure conditions of energy deficit, but with the cost of decreased adaptability to varying ecological conditions 
later in life due to decreased investment in the development in other organs.
During neonatal development, the brain is most vulnerable to irregularities in energy supply. The high adi-
posity of humans at birth in comparison to other mammalian species66 provides an energetic buffer67, preserv-
ing cerebral metabolism despite high early-life energetic requirements. Furthermore, preferential distribution of 
resources is evident in undernourished foetuses, in whom some organs grow normally while others are underde-
veloped68. For humans, the brain’s development is spared69, perhaps at the expense of muscle70. Low birth weight, 
indicative of foetal undernourishment, is associated with a negative relationship between development of brain 
and muscles71. The selfish nature of the brain has also been observed in the unique preservation of brain mass 
in individuals suffering from long-term malnutrition or starvation51, in children born with intrauterine growth 
restriction72,73 and in glucose-challenging situations such as fasting or hypo/hyper-glycaemia74–76.
The evidence presented in this paper, which builds upon the existing body of research, indicates the possibility 
of an evolutionary trade-off between brain and muscle energetic demands.
Conclusion
This study has demonstrated an acute level trade-off between cognitive function and physical power output dur-
ing simultaneous challenge. This supports the selfish brain hypothesis due to the relative preservation of cognitive 
function over physical power output. The underlying mechanism is unclear, and requires further investigation.
Methods
Sixty-two male rowers were recruited from the University of Cambridge, and testing was carried out in 
Cambridge, UK (mean age = 21.15 years, SD = 1.618 years). All participants were instructed in the risks and ben-
efits of participating in the study and signed a written informed consent statement. The statement and the study 
was approved by the University of Cambridge Biology Ethics Committee (Application No: HBREC.2013.12), and 
the study was conducted in accordance with the approved methodology.
Participants completed three protocols (Table 3). Protocol A consisted of a maximum effort row for 3 minutes 
at free rate on a Concept 2 rowing ergometer (manufactured by Concept 2, Vermont, USA), and average power 
output (W) was recorded. Protocol B consisted of a mental free recall task, the number of words correctly recalled

was recorded. Protocol C consisted of the same 3 minute row as A, but while simultaneously performing the 
mental task of Protocol B. Both average power output and number of words correctly recalled were recorded.
The rowing ergometer was used because it is an energetically demanding activity, and has been used in previ-
ous studies investigating extreme physical stress77,78. The mental task involved free recall. A large printed screen 
showing 75 words was clearly displayed in front of the participants’ chair (Protocol B), or in front of the rowing 
ergometer (Protocol C), for a duration of 3 minutes. The participants were required to recall and write as many 
words as possible in any order from memory within 5 minutes (5 minutes immediately following the row in 
Protocol C)79. The words were selected from the Toronto Noun Pool80. Two 75-word lists were randomly created 
from the 150 words used by Kahana & Howard81 and were counterbalanced across participants. Half of the partic-
ipants were given List 1 for Protocol B and List 2 for Protocol C, with the other half being given List 2 for Protocol 
B and List 1 for Protocol C. This method ensured that each word was seen an equal number of times across par-
ticipants, and each participant saw each word only once. Such counterbalancing ensured that any artefacts82 were 
controlled for to reduce the likelihood of such artefacts83.
The Protocols were completed at 1 week intervals. All participants refrained from extra exercise the day before, 
and the day of, each Protocol. The same machine was used for Protocols A and B, with the drag factor being con-
sistent. The order in which the participants completed the three protocols was also counterbalanced, in order to 
control for any effects such as the development of memorising strategies.
