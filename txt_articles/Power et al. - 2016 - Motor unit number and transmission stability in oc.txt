Our group has shown a greater number of functioning motor units
(MU) in a cohort of highly active older (�65 yr) masters runners
relative to age-matched controls. Because of the precipitous loss in the
number of functioning MUs in the eighth and ninth decades of life it
is unknown whether older world class octogenarian masters athletes
(MA) would also have greater numbers of functioning MUs compared
with age-matched controls. We measured MU numbers and neuro-
muscular transmission stability in the tibialis anterior of world cham-
pion MAs (�80 yr) and compared the values with healthy age-
matched controls (�80 yr). Decomposition-enhanced spike-triggered
averaging was used to collect surface and intramuscular electromyog-
raphy signals during dorsiflexion at �25% of maximum voluntary
isometric contraction. Near fiber (NF) MU potential analysis was used
to assess neuromuscular transmission stability. For the MAs compared
with age-matched controls, the amount of excitable muscle mass
(compound muscle action potential) was 14% greater (P � 0.05),
there was a trend (P � 0.07) toward a 27% smaller surface-detected
MU potential representative of less collateral reinnervation, and 28%
more functioning MUs (P � 0.05). Additionally, the MAs had greater
MU neuromuscular stability than the controls, as indicated by lower
NF jitter and jiggle values (P � 0.05). These results demonstrate that
high-performing octogenarians better maintain neuromuscular stabil-
ity of the MU and mitigate the loss of MUs associated with aging well
into the later decades of life during which time the loss of muscle
mass and strength becomes functionally relevant. Future studies may
identify the concomitant roles genetics and exercise play in neuro-
protection.

NEW & NOTEWORTHY
World champion master athletes in their ninth decade of life
had a greater number of surviving motor units, reduced col-
lateral reinnervation, better neuromuscular transmission sta-
bility, and a greater amount of excitable muscle mass com-
pared with age-matched controls. The presumed better main-
tenance of motor units occurs at a time point when motor unit
loss is greatest and the loss of muscle mass becomes function-
ally relevant, potentially maintaining function and attenuating
the deleterious effects of sarcopenia.
AGING IS ASSOCIATED WITH a loss of functioning motor units
(MU) (7, 9, 12, 27, 36). The loss of MUs is concomitant with
the denervation of muscle, loss of motor axons, and eventual
�-motoneuron (MN) death (11, 16). With electrophysiological
techniques it is possible to estimate the number of functioning
MUs and thus make inferences on the number of surviving
MNs in old age. Additionally, we can gain insight into neuro-
physiological changes associated with aging, such as MU
neuromuscular transmission instability (17, 31). Age-related
alterations to neuromuscular transmission instability may re-
flect clinical conditions of neuromuscular transmission distur-
bance and may represent early axonal denervation (2, 11).
Moreover, alterations to electrophysiological measures of MU
transmission may indicate MU dysfunction preceding the func-
tionally relevant loss of strength and excitable muscle mass
known as sarcopenia (16).
From cross-sectional studies it appears there is a gradual
reduction in the number of functioning MUs after the third
decade of life until the seventh decade followed by a rapid
decline into very old age (26, 28, 32). The early adult loss of
MUs does not appear to be associated with weakness or
functional decline due to the preservation of muscle mass and
strength (28), through the process of collateral reinnervation
whereby healthy MNs sprout axons that reinnervate those
muscle fibers remaining following the death of a MN. The
number of functioning MUs can be estimated (MUNE) elec-
trophysiologically by dividing the mean “electrical” size of
surface-detected motor unit potentials (S-MUP) into the cor-

 responding size parameter of the compound muscle action
potential (CMAP) (Ref. 36 and Fig. 1). Age-related reductions
of 40-60% in the number of functioning MUs have been
reported for several human limb muscles, including the biceps
brachii (8, 14, 33), extensor digitorum brevis (29), vastus
lateralis (31), tibialis anterior (TA) (17, 28, 32, 34), soleus (10,
40), and small intrinsic hand muscles (7, 14, 15).
Our group has reported greater MUNE in individuals with
high levels of lifelong physical activity in a muscle that
typically demonstrates age-related MU loss (34). We found
that masters runners in their seventh decade of life had a
similar CMAP and a smaller mean S-MUP compared with their
age-matched counterparts. These parameters likely indicate the
masters runners have not undergone the same extent of MU
remodeling (i.e., MU loss and subsequent collateral reinnerva-
tion) as did their age-matched controls. Moreover, cross-sec-
tional studies indicate that the age-related loss of MUs is
exacerbated in healthy older adults who are in their eighth and
ninth decades of life (28, 32). Thus, the purpose of this study
is to compare cross-sectionally, a cohort of masters athletes

 (MAs) and age-matched controls to answer the important
question: if functioning MUs are maintained in a group of MAs
in their seventh decade of life, can world class MAs two
decades older also show a maintenance of MUs, during a time
point in which MU loss is typically greatest, and the loss of
muscle mass becomes functionally relevant? We investigated,
electrophysiologically, MU number and MU stability in a
cohort of some of the world’s most successful agers: octoge-
narian world class MAs. We hypothesized there will be MU
remodeling as indicated by changes in the electrophysiological
measures of MU stability, and S-MUPs in both groups, albeit
less in the MAs. In addition, the MA will have a higher MUNE
compared with age-matched controls because of more excit-
able muscle mass (as indicated by a larger CMAP) through
improved collateral reinnervation.
METHODS
Participants. Participants consisted of 29 (Table 1) elderly males
and females with no known neurological, musculoskeletal, metabolic,
or cardiovascular health conditions. The MA consisted of track and
field athletes ranked in the top four of their respective events at the
world masters championships (including 7 current world record hold-
ers). Event specialties ranged from sprint and power events to middle
and long distance running events (800 m up to marathon). The age-
and sex-matched controls were living independently and recruited
from the local community. All participants were asked to refrain from
unaccustomed and strenuous exercise before testing. This study was
approved by the McGill Faculty of Medicine Institutional Review
Board for research involving human subjects (A08-M66-12B) and
conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed written consent
was obtained from all participants before the study.
Experimental arrangement. All procedures were conducted during
a single testing session on a Biodex System 3 dynamometer (Biodex
Medical Systems, Shirley, NY) using the isometric mode. The hip and
knee angle were maintained at 90° while the participants were seated
and reclined comfortably. Ankle angle was positioned to 30° of
plantar flexion. The foot of the dominant leg (right) was secured to the
footplate with two hook and loop inelastic straps (Velcro USA,
Manchester, NH) across the toes and the dorsum of the foot, and
another strap secured the ankle. The torso of the participant was
secured to the Biodex seat back by inelastic straps fastened across the
shoulders and waist. To minimize extraneous leg movement, the thigh
was supported and stabilized with an inelastic strap. The lateral
malleolus was aligned with the dynamometer’s axis of rotation.
TA electromyographic data acquisition. For the present investiga-
tion, the TA was selected because of its known loss of MUs with
normal adult aging (17, 28, 32, 34) and the role of high levels of
activity related to greater MUNE in masters runners (34). Participants
performed
three
dorsiflexion
maximal
voluntary
contractions
(MVCs), with at least 3 min of rest between attempts. Each MVC was
held for �3 s, and participants were provided with real-time visual
feedback of their torque output and were verbally encouraged.
Voluntary activation and torque. Voluntary activation during the
second and third MVC attempts was assessed using the interpolated
twitch technique (ITT; see Ref. 3). This technique involved supra-
maximal percutaneous electrical stimulation of the common fibular
nerve inferior to the fibular head using a clinical stimulator/EMG
system (Neuroscan Comperio system; Neurosoft, El Paso, TX). The
amplitude of the interpolated torque electrically evoked during the
plateau of the MVC was compared with a resting twitch evoked �1
s following the MVC. Voluntary activation (VA) was calculated as a
percent using the equation: [1 � (interpolated twitch/resting twitch)] �
100. The ITT ensured the participants were providing a maximal
voluntary effort during MVCs to allow comparison of submaximal
contraction levels (see below) between groups. Participants were
required to achieve 95% VA or greater before continuing with data
collection; and, typical for this muscle group (18, 24, 37), this was
achieved following familiarization in all participants. The peak torque
of the three MVC attempts was taken as the maximal torque amplitude
for the participant. All torque signals were collected and sampled
online at 500 Hz and stored on the Biodex computer for additional
off-line analysis.
Surface EMG signals were recorded from the TA using self-
adhering Ag-AgCl electrodes (1 � 3 cm). The active electrode was
placed over the TA motor point, �7 cm distal to the tibial tuberosity
and 2 cm lateral to the anterior border of the TA. This placement was
adjusted as needed to maximize TA CMAP amplitude and minimize
rise time. The reference electrode was placed over the distal tendon of
the TA. A ground electrode was placed over the patella.
Decomposition-based quantitative electromyography (DQEMG)
data were acquired using a protocol described in detail elsewhere (13,
39). Intramuscular EMG signals were recorded via a disposable
concentric needle electrode (model N53153; Teca, Hawthorne, NY)
inserted in the TA, 5–10 mm distal to the active surface electrode. The
surface and intramuscular EMG signals were bandpass filtered at 5 Hz
to 1 kHz and 10 Hz to 10 kHz, respectively. Surface EMG signals
were sampled at 3 kHz; intramuscular EMG signals were sampled at
30 kHz. To evoke the maximum CMAP a bar electrode held distal to
the fibular head provided the delivery of supramaximal electrical
stimuli to the common fibular nerve. Subsequently, participants
matched a target line of 25% MVC, visible on a computer monitor, for
all isometric dorsiflexion contractions while the intramuscular needle
electrode was inserted and gently manipulated in the muscle to
minimize the rise times of the majority of detected motor unit
potentials (MUPs). This contraction intensity has been shown to be
the most effective intensity for obtaining a representative MUNE in
the TA (28). Surface and intramuscular EMG signals were recorded
during �30 s of sustained steady target torque. Between contractions,
the concentric needle electrode was repositioned to ensure sampling
of different MUs. These procedures were repeated until at least 20
suitable MUP trains and their respective S-MUPs were acquired.
TA decomposition-based quantitative electromyography analysis.
Decomposed intramuscular EMG signals were reviewed off-line to
determine the acceptability of the extracted MUP trains and their
corresponding S-MUPs. MUP trains were inspected visually to ensure
that their MUP occurrence patterns were consistent with the expected
activity of a single MU (consistent firing pattern and interdischarge
coefficient of variation of �0.3). Invalid MUP trains and their asso-
ciated S-MUPs were excluded from further analyses. The DQEMG
algorithms estimate a MUP and S-MUP template waveform and
automatically place markers related to onset, end, negative peak, and
positive peak positions with respect to the MUP template and onset,

 negative peak onset, end, negative peak, and positive positions with
respect to the S-MUP template. All MUP and S-MUP markers were
subsequently reviewed visually by the same operator. A MUNE was
derived by dividing the negative peak amplitude of the maximal
CMAP by the negative peak amplitude of the mean S-MUP.
For the assessment of MUP stability, used to reflect the stability of
neuromuscular transmission, MUPs that represent the isolated activity
of a single MU were automatically selected by the DQEMG algo-
rithms. The sets of automatically selected isolated MUPs were in-
spected visually, and any MUPs found to be significantly contami-
nated by the activity of other MUs were removed. The DQEMG
technique described has been shown to possess strong test-retest
reliability within individuals (5) and high degrees of intra- and
inter-rater reliability in control and clinical populations (2). The
investigator was blinded to the status of the participant (MA vs.
age-matched controls) during off-line analysis.
Near fiber MUP parameters: near fiber MUP template. The MUP
template provided by the DQEMG algorithms was high-pass filtered
using a second-ordered low-pass differentiator (39). The second-order
filter equation is: [xt � yt�2 � yt�1 � yt � yt�1] where yt is the
sampled raw signal and xt is the sampled filtered signal. Because of
the spatial low-pass filtering properties of volume conduction, the
resulting near fiber (NF) MUP template waveform is used to focus on
characteristics of a MU’s muscle fibers in close proximity (within
�350 �m) to the needle electrode and is defined as a MUP containing
contributions from the fibers that are close to the detection surface of
the needle electrode. As such, a NF “contribution” is the specific
electrophysiological contribution of an individual NF (an individual
muscle fiber or small group of MU muscle fibers) to a NF MUP. This
methodology is particularly useful for studying variables related to
neuromuscular transmission stability (i.e., jitter, jiggle), since it allows
for the examination of individual MU waveforms with much less
contamination from other more distant MUs compared with signals
collected with traditional Butterworth filtering. This is the result of the
spatial filtering applied to create NF MUPs, which filters out more
distant volume conducted MU activity that could potentially reduce
the ability to detect individual muscle fiber activity. Measures of NF
MUPs in turn can be used to reflect relative conduction times of
muscle fiber action potentials to the electrode detection surface.
Further details regarding NF MUP parameters have been described
previously (2).
NF parameters. The following NF parameters were originally
described in clinical populations (1, 2), and some have been used in
the investigation of normal adult aging (17). NF area is the sum of the
absolute values of the NF MUP between the onset and end positions
multiplied by the sampling interval (i.e., 1/sampling rate). NF count
(NF fiber count) is the number of detected NF contributions to the NF
MUP. A positive turn detected in the NF MUP with sufficient
symmetry and amplitude is considered a distinct NF contribution. The
NF fiber count reflects the density of fibers composing a MU. The
maximum NF interval is the maximum time between consecutive
detected NF contributions. Large maximum NF interval values may
indicate long reinnervating axonal sprouts. NF jiggle (Fig. 1) is a
statistic that measures the variability in the shape of consecutive
isolated NF MUPs of a MUP train. The statistic is the same as
originally applied to traditional MUPs (38). The NF MUPs of a MUP
train are created by high-pass filtering each MUP using the same
second-ordered low-pass differentiator used to create the NF MUP
template. Isolated NF MUPs are selected as described previously (39).
NF jitter is the mean consecutive difference of time intervals between
a pair of distinct NF contributions found consistently within the NF
MUPs of a selection of isolated NF MUPs as described by others (2,
38, 39). Suitable NF contribution pair tracking was confirmed by
visual inspection.
Statistical analyses of the data were performed with SPSS version
22 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Unpaired t-tests were used to compare
participant characteristic values. A two-way analysis of variance
(sex � activity status) was used to analyze all electrophysiological
data. If no interactions were present for sex and activity status, the
data were collapsed for sex and compared across activity level using
unpaired t-tests. The level of significance was set at P � 0.05. To
explore the strength of apparent statistical effects, effect sizes (ES)
were calculated using Cohen’s d. Pearson product correlations (r)
were implemented to test the strength of independent relationships
between the NF MUP and MUNE parameters. Descriptive data in the
text and Tables 1 and 2 are reported as means � SD, whereas data
reported in Figs. 1–3 are means � SE.
RESULTS
Participant characteristics are presented in Table 1. Volun-
tary activation, as assessed using the interpolated twitch tech-
nique, was �95% for all groups. There was a sex � activity
status interaction for dorsiflexion strength; therefore, the
strength data were not collapsed across sex. The MA males
were 28% stronger compared with age-matched controls (P �
0.01; ES � 1.88), and MA females were 22% stronger com-
pared with age-matched controls (P � 0.01; ES � 1.93). For
all other variables listed below there were no interactions or
main effects for sex. Therefore, data were collapsed across sex
and compared for activity status.
MU number estimates. The groups did not differ (P � 0.05)
in the root mean square (RMS) value of the surface EMG
during the targeting contractions (�25% MVC) expressed as a
percentage of MVC-RMS (25–30%), and the mean MU dis-
charge rates did not differ (P � 0.05) between the groups. The
negative peak amplitude of the CMAP was 14% larger in the
MAs compared with age-matched controls (P � 0.05; ES �
0.98; Fig. 2A), likely indicating a greater amount of excitable
muscle mass. The negative peak amplitude of the mean S-MUP
was not statistically different across groups. Nonetheless, there
was a statistical trend (P � 0.07; ES � 0.67) for the MA group
to have a 27% smaller value (Fig. 2B). This may indicate that
collateral reinnervation is occurring in the MAs, but the extent
to which MUs are being remodeled, as further evidenced by the
20-�V smaller S-MUP, is less than age-matched controls. With
a presumed greater amount of excitable muscle mass and less
collateral reinnervation, MAs had a 28% greater number of
functioning MUs compared with their age-matched counter-
parts (P � 0.01; ES � 1.14; Fig. 2C).
Neuromuscular transmission stability. NF MUP parameter
values are presented in Table 2. MA had similar NF area,
duration, and maximum NF interval values compared with
age-matched controls (P � 0.05). However, for all other
measures of neuromuscular transmission stability, MAs had
smaller values compared with age-matched controls: NF fiber
counts (�19%, P � 0.05; ES � 0.93), NF jiggle (�21%; P �
0.01; ES � 1.21), and NF jitter values (�19%; P � 0.05; ES �
1.02), indicating greater neuromuscular transmission stability
compared with their age-matched counterparts. Additionally,
across groups there was a significant positive association be-
tween increasing S-MUP amplitude and increases in NF jiggle
(r � 0.56; P � 0.01) and NF jitter (r � 0.52; P � 0.01; Fig.
3). Furthermore, as expected, there was a significant negative
association with MUNE and NF jiggle (r � �0.59; P � 0.01)
and NF jitter (r � �0.55; P � 0.01). These associations would
indicate that, as MUs are being remodeled (collateral reinner-
vation) with increasing MU size, there is less stable neuromus-
cular transmission in the age-matched controls but not MAs.

 DISCUSSION
The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether
MUNE was higher in world class octogenarian MA compared
with age-matched controls. Using electrophysiological tech-
niques, we investigated the number of functioning MU and
neuromuscular transmission stability in a cohort of the world’s
most successful agers: very old world class MAs. The hypoth-
esis was confirmed. Despite evidence of MU remodeling (S-
MUP; Fig. 2B), because of a greater amount of excitable
muscle mass as reflected by a larger CMAP (Fig. 2A), there
was a higher MUNE in the MAs compared with age-matched
controls (Fig. 2C). Additionally, the MAs had greater neuro-
muscular transmission stability than the controls, as indicated
by lower values for NF jitter and NF jiggle, indicating rela-
tively healthier MUs (Table 2). Previously we showed (34) that
lifelong high-intensity physical activity may have the potential
to limit the loss of functional MUs associated with natural
aging well into the seventh decade of life. Our current findings
show this is also evident in world class athletes nearly two
decades older, a critical time point when MU loss may be a
great contributor to the loss of muscle mass (sarcopenia),
resulting in substantial strength and functional deficits.
MU number estimation. Indirect evidence of collateral rein-
nervation can be found from the size of the negative peak
amplitude of the mean S-MUP. In a previous investigation of
old masters runners (65 yr), there was a similar-sized S-MUP
compared with young adults, whereas age-matched controls
had a higher value (34). A higher S-MUP in age-matched
controls compared with masters runners and a similar CMAP
indicated that the older runners had not undergone substantial
collateral reinnervation, and therefore had higher MUNEs than
age-matched controls, similar to that of young adults. In the
present investigation, we showed that MAs in their ninth
decade of life did not differ from age-matched controls for
S-MUP values. However, presumably because of a greater
amount of excitable muscle mass (CMAP), the MAs had a
higher number of functioning MUs. It is important to note there
was a trend toward a difference in S-MUP across groups with
an �20-�V lower value for the MAs, likely indicating that,
while there was MN loss and MUs are being remodeled, this
process is occurring to a lesser extent in MAs than for age-
matched controls (Fig. 2B). Through collateral reinnervation
muscle mass is maintained, but subsequently larger MUs are
formed as represented by the S-MUP and NF size parameters
(Table 2), and it appears these larger MUs in both groups have
different neuromuscular transmission stability properties (see
below).
Our current findings in “very old” age-matched controls are
similar to that of McNeil et al. (28) who investigated MUNE in
the TA across young, old, and very old adults ranging from 23
to 89 yr. They found, while there was no difference in strength
between the young and old groups, there was a reduction in
MUNE. Moreover, in the very old group, there was a signifi-
cant loss of both strength and MUNE, suggesting that func-

 tional significance of MU loss may not occur until after the
seventh decade of life. In the present study the male and female
MAs both had higher MUNE and higher strength values
compared with sex- and age-matched controls (Table 1). Ad-
ditionally, with advanced aging, the capacity of MUs to con-
tinue sprouting is potentially less effective (30), and this could
be the case in the age-matched controls. A possible explanation
is that reinnervation may not be keeping pace with denervation
in advanced age, which could explain the reduced CMAP. By
the nature of cross-sectional designs, selection bias can be a
limitation. Hence, further research is needed to establish lon-
gitudinal changes and whether physical activity can prevent or
slow the age-related loss of the number of functional MUs.
NF MUP parameters. Standard concentric needle EMG can
provide detailed information regarding the denervation-rein-
nervation process underlying age-related MU loss. The integ-
rity of neuromuscular transmission can be identified through
variability in the overall shape of consecutively detected NF
MUPs and in the relative timings of their significant NF
contributions (2, 38). Two key features related to variability in
NF MUP shape and in the relative timings of significant NF
contributions are jiggle and jitter, respectively (2, 38). Jiggle
refers to the variability in overall NF MUP shape from one MU
discharge to the next, and jitter refers to the variability of the
time intervals between pairs of significant NF contributions
across a set of isolated NF MUPs. Increases in both jiggle and
jitter have been reported under clinical conditions of neuro-
muscular transmission disturbance and can reflect early axonal
denervation (2, 11).
Our age-matched control NF jiggle results are consistent
with two recent investigations specific to aging that found
increased NF jiggle in NF MUPs detected in the TA, vastus
medialis (77 yr) (17), and vastus lateralis muscles of older
adults (71 yr) compared with young (31). The age-matched
controls in the present study had higher values of NF jiggle and
NF jitter compared with MAs, and this may be reflective of
aberrations in muscle fiber action potential propagation, or
neuromuscular transmission instability, and could be the result
of the development of dysfunctional neuromuscular junctions
(NMJs) of newly reinnervated fibers (16). In the present study,
NF area was not different across groups, which may be more
reflective of intrinsic MU electrophysiological changes than
the negative peak area of surface-detected potentials (S-MUP)
that were trending but not significantly different between
groups. Additionally, we show increased NF count in age-
matched controls compared with MA, which is indicative of
reinnervation presumably to compensate for prior denervation
(i.e., MU remodeling) (6). These electrophysiological mea-
sures of grouping are consistent with histological evidence of
increased MU homogeneity (i.e., fiber type grouping) in ad-
vanced age (16, 21, 25).
It appears that both groups of older adults are experiencing
MU remodeling, but the MAs exhibit reduced and more effec-
tive reinnervation indicated by smaller S-MUPs and more
stable neuromuscular transmission while the age-matched con-
trols present with more extensive remodeling and less stable
neuromuscular transmission. This nature of the remodeling for
both groups is further characterized by the positive relation-
ships between NF jiggle, NF jitter, and SMUP size, and a
negative relationship with MUNE (Fig. 3). Thus, in advanced
age, collateral reinnervation seems to result in less healthy
MUs. Specifically, a decrease in neuromuscular transmission
stability is thought to occur in association with partial loss of
innervation by damaged motor axons, or incomplete reinner-
vation occurring between orphaned muscle fibers and their
adopted axonal sprout during the process of collateral reinner-
vation (38). We suggest that the age-matched controls may

Fig. 3. Relationships between NF jiggle (A), NF jitter and S-MUP (B), NF jiggle (C), and NF jitter and MUNE (D) between MA (open circles) and age-matched
controls (gray circles). All relationships were statistically significant (P � 0.01). The participant (88 yr) with the largest mean S-MUP had the lowest MUNE
count and also had the highest values for NF jiggle and second highest for NF jitter (black circles). Removing this participant reduces the “r” values slightly,
but statistical significance is maintained.

 have developed less stable new axons during reinnervation,
resulting in increased NF jitter and NF jiggle values.
Maintained MU numbers and MU stability. Lifelong phys-
ical activity has been shown to maintain spinal MN and MU
numbers in rats (22) and humans (33–35), respectively. The
upregulation of neurotrophic factors and sensitivity of the MN
via increased neuromuscular activity (19, 20, 22), and main-
tained sympathetic input to the NMJ (23), may offset age-
related MN death. As well, chronic activity into advanced age
may have a protective effect at the epigenomic level initiating
changes in the methylation landscape of gene promoter path-
ways associated with MUs (4). Whether thorough exercise
training across a lifespan or being born with exceptional
genetics is responsible for the MA’s exceptional athletic per-
formance, the MAs presented with improved MU survival and
reduced and more mature collateral reinnervation with better
neuromuscular transmission stability compared with age-
matched controls. The challenge for future studies is to explore
these key factors and to identify underlying mechanisms.
In conclusion, accompanying the substantial loss of MUs is
a progressive loss of contractile muscle mass and impaired
whole muscle force generation (28, 32). This time course of
degradation is evident in the lower strength values and loss of
MUs in the age-matched controls, whereas the MA had higher
force production capacity of the ankle dorsiflexors possibly
because of not only a maintenance of MU number but more
electrophysiologically stable MUs (32). It seems that MU
electrophysiological quality is lower in the age-matched con-
trols, as indicated by reduced neuromuscular transmission
stability compared with the MAs; how this may influence
strength or function is currently unknown. World champion
MAs in their ninth decade of life had a greater number of
surviving MUs, reduced collateral reinnervation, better preser-
vation of neuromuscular transmission stability, and hence bet-
ter preservation of excitable muscle mass compared with age-
matched controls. The presumed better maintenance of MUs in
MAs occurs at a time point when MUNE loss is greatest and
the loss of muscle mass and strength becomes functionally
relevant, potentially maintaining function and attenuating sar-
copenia in this exceptional cohort of older adults. Future
studies on the potential neuroprotective effects of exercise in
older humans need to identify the concomitant role of genetics
and dose dependence of exercise in maintaining neuromuscular
structure and function.
