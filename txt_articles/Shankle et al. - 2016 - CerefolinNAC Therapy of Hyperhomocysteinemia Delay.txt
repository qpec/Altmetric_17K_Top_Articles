Abstract. We examined whether using a medical food therapy for hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) in patients with Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) or cognitive impairment due to cerebrovascular disease (CVD) with Cerefolin®/CerefolinNAC® (CFLN: L-
methylfolate, methylcobalamin, and N-acetyl-cysteine) slowed regional brain atrophy. Thirty HHcy patients with AD and
related disorders (ADRD) received CFLN (HHcy+CFLN: duration [� ± σ] = 18.6 ± 16.1 months); a sub-sample of this
group did not receive CFLN for varying periods of time (HHcy+NoCFLN: duration [� ± σ] = 12.6 ± 5.6 months). Thirty-
seven NoHHcy patients with ADRD did not receive CFLN (NoHHcy+NoCFLN: duration [� ± σ] = 13.3 ± 17.7 months).
No participant took supplemental B vitamins. Regional brain volumes were measured at baseline and end of study, and
covariate-adjusted rates of hippocampal, cortical, and forebrain parenchymal (includes white matter) atrophy were predicted.
The HHcy+CFLN group’s hippocampal and cortical atrophy adjusted rates were 4.25 and 11.2 times slower than those of
the NoHHcy+NoCFLN group (p < 0.024). The HHcy+CFLN group’s forebrain parenchyma atrophy rate was significantly
slower only for CVD; the rate of slowing was proportional to the degree of homocysteine lowering (p < 0.0001). CFLN was
associated with significantly slowed hippocampal and cortical atrophy rates in ADRD patients with HHcy, and forebrain
parenchymal atrophy rates in CVD patients with HHcy. The present results should be further validated.

INTRODUCTION
Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is a common con-
dition worldwide with its prevalence ranging from
5.1% to 29% in persons over 65 years of age [1–3].

HHcy is associated with a wide variety of neurolog-
ical disorders including stroke, Parkinson’s disease,
and multiple sclerosis [4]. Compared to subjects with
normal homocysteine levels, HHcy also associates
with poorer cognitive performance [5], and with rela-
tively greater regional brain atrophy [6] and ischemic
lesions (i.e., white matter hyperintensities, ischemia,
or infarcts) [7]. Furthermore, the odds of brain atro-
phy are up to 10 times higher in HHcy patients than in

those with normal homocysteine levels [8], and high,
compared to normal, baseline homocysteine levels
predicts moderate-severe whole brain atrophy 5 years
later [9].
HHcy management with B vitamin supplementa-
tion (e.g., folic acid, B12, B6) has been previously
studied for its effects on cognition and brain volume.
However, the results of these studies have not been
consistent [7–10]. An alternative therapy of HHcy is a
prescription medical food containing L-methylfolate,
methylcobalamin, and N-acetyl-cysteine (CFLN:
Cerefolin®/CerefolinNAC®). CFLN is specially for-
mulated to address metabolic imbalances of HHcy
and neurovascular oxidative stress, which have
been associated with cognitive impairment. Several
constituents of CFLN (L-methylfolate and methyl-
cobalamin)arethereduced,immediatelybioavailable
forms of folate and B12, and are therefore not chem-
ically or biologically equivalent to folic acid and
B12. In addition, L-methylfolate is the form of folate
that is preferentially transported into cerebrospinal
fluid [11, 12]. In contrast, folic acid is not biolog-
ically active and has been shown to competitively
displace L-methylfolate binding and transport to
cerebrospinal fluid [12].
Our previous studies [13, 14] have shown slower
cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer’s dis-
ease and related disorders (ADRD) who were treated
for HHcy with CFLN (HHcy+CFLN) compared to
those without HHcy who did not receive CFLN
(NoHHcy+NoCFLN), all of whom did not receive
B vitamin supplementation. The slowed cognitive
decline was observed in learning and memory,
constructional praxis, and visual-spatial executive
function, and was more significant in patients with
milder baseline severity and with CFLN treat-
ment durations of at least one year [14]. These
findings are noteworthy because a significant differ-
ence between HHcy+CFLN and NoHHcy+NoCFLN
groups requires at least as large of a CFLN treatment
effect than HHcy+CFLN versus HHcy+NoCFLN,
because of potentially greater cognitive decline found
in HHcy compared to NoHHcy [15, 16]. Managing
HHcy may therefore be essential for slowing cogni-
tive decline.
The present study examined the rate of brain atro-
phy using the same sample [14] as was used for the
previously reported cognitive outcomes. We used the
same “higher bar” of comparing HHcy+CFLN to
NoHHcy+NoCFLN groups. The primary between-
group measures were regional brain atrophy rates
of these two groups. To demonstrate a statistically
significant treatment effect, CFLN must therefore
overcome the more rapid atrophy due to HHcy,
plus slow atrophy beyond that of patients without
HHcy.
METHODS
Study design
Institutional review board approval was obtained
for this study. Patients were recruited from a single-
site community memory clinic. Inclusion criteria
were that patients had: 1) a final ADRD diagno-
sis based on standardized evaluation with laboratory,
imaging, cognitive, and functional assessment; 2)
at least one prior quantitative MRI (qMRI) study;
3) previous plasma homocysteine level measured to
determine whether or not they had HHcy (in this
study HHcy is defined as a plasma homocysteine
level ≥ 12 umol/liter); and 4) either HHcy treated
with CFLN or had no HHcy. Patients who had been
taking B vitamin supplementations were excluded
from the study.
Study sample
67 patients met study eligibility criteria (HHcy+
CFLN: n = 30; NoHHcy+NoCFLN: n = 37). All pati-
ents had an ADRD diagnosis, and were treated with
a cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI) plus memantine,
which was kept unchanged over the course of the
study. Each patient’s baseline qMRI volumetric data
were compared to the qMRI volumetric data obtained
for the present study. Each patient’s “baseline” was
defined as the date of their first qMRI study. Addi-
tionally, each patient was clinically followed every
3–6 months, and assessed cognitively using the MCI
Screen, CERAD Drawings, Ishihara Number Nam-
ing, Trails A and B, and F-A-S verbal fluency test.
Functional severity was assessed using the Functional
Assessment Staging Test (FAST) procedure. There
are 7 major stages and 16 sub-stages, each with a
published mean duration of the untreated course of
AD [17]. For both groups, blood samples were col-
lected for homocysteine level and genetic study of
single nucleotide polymorphisms. Available longitu-
dinal data for HHcy patients had periods with and
without CFLN treatment (HHcy+NoCFLN). This
allowed a within-subject analysis of HHcy patients
that could evaluate the effect of HHcy with and with-
out CFLN treatment on cognitive decline. Table 1
summarizes sample characteristics.

Quantitative MRI outcomes measures
All patients had two or more qMRIs for analysis.
NeuroQuant® volumetric data from hippocampus,
cortex,andforebrainparenchymawereanalyzed.The
term, parenchyma, includes both gray matter and
white matter. The forebrain parenchyma is most rele-
vant to cerebrovascular disease because it has a large
contribution from subcortical white matter.
Analyses of treatment versus control group
differences
To identify covariates to adjust for group dif-
ferences between HHcy+CFLN and NoHHcy+
NoCFLN groups, we performed appropriate signif-
icance tests on variables belonging to demographic,
diagnostic, and severity (FAST stage) categories
(non-parametric χ2 tests [Stata 13.0, tab] tests for
ordinal or nominal scale variables, and multivariate
mean vector tests or t-tests for ratio scale variables).
Outcome measures
CFLN treatment effect on regional brain atrophy
rates was expressed as a binary variable (CFLN treat-
ment: yes/no), and as ratio scale variables (CFLN
duration: years, and CFLN/Study ratio: CFLN dura-
tion normalized by study duration). Atrophy rates
(slopes) were computed as volume change per year
per brain region. Negative volume changes per year
indicate greater rates of atrophy (tissue loss).
Analytical methods
The analyzed variables were baseline and study
endpoint qMRI volume per brain region, apolipopro-
tein E (ApoE) genotype, CFLN, ChEI and memantine
use and duration, demographics, homocysteine level,
ADRD diagnosis, and FAST stage severity. Exoge-
nous, potentially confounding variables not available
for analysis were B12 and folate levels, history
of developmental folate supplementation, hyperlipi-
demia, and alcohol dependence.
Predictor variables were represented in nominal,
ordinal and ratio scales (when their precision per-
mitted). Two-way interaction effects were assessed
between treatment (CFLN, memantine, ChEI), sever-
ity (FAST stage), ADRD diagnosis, and presence of 1
or more ApoE4 alleles. Each predictor variable was
included as a fixed and a random effect in a multi-
level model, to determine if it significantly predicted
regional atrophy rates. Non-significant fixed and ran-
dom effects were removed from the model.
The first model analyzed only contained patient
as a random effect (unconditional means model).
The second model analyzed was a growth model,
 1076
W.R. Shankle et al. / CerefolinNAC Therapy Reduces Brain Atrophy
which added baseline regional qMRI volume as
a fixed effect to the unconditional means model.
Subsequent models added various combinations of
the variables analyzed to adjust for potential con-
founds on the treatment variables–CFLN, ChEI,
and memantine. The final models estimated the
confounder-adjusted, CFLN treatment effects on the
intercepts and slopes of the hippocampal, cortical
and forebrain parenchymal atrophy rates (predict,
lfitci, Stata 13.0). When variables measuring effects
of CFLN treatment or no CFLN treatment were
significant in a confounder-adjusted model, t-tests
were used to determine if their difference between
HHcy+CFLN and NoHHcy+NoCFLN groups was
significant (Stata 13.0, ttest).
RESULTS
Sample group differences
Table 1 shows that the HHcy+CFLN group had a
relatively higher proportion of cognitively impaired
patients with cerebrovascular disease (CVD). Sig-
nificant (p < 0.05) or borderline significant (p < 0.10)
t-tests (Stata 13.0, ttest) showed that HHcy+CFLN
patients were older, and had smaller baseline
hippocampal, cortical, and forebrain parenchymal
volumes. Due to study design, HHcy+CFLN patients
also had higher baseline homocysteine levels, and
larger changes in homocysteine level from base-
line to study endpoint (homocysteine � = Endpoint
– Baseline Homocysteine). 87% (26/30) of the
HHcY+CFLN group took the form of CFLN
containing N-acetyl-cysteine for some or all of the
study period.
Predicting annual rate of hippocampal atrophy
The unconditional means model for predicting
hippocampal atrophy was not significant (p = 0.16),
which means that hippocampal slope is not predicted
by a constant. The growth model for predict-
ing hippocampal atrophy was also not significant
(p = 0.222), which means that hippocampal slope is
not predicted by baseline hippocampal volume. Fur-
ther analysis with the mixed effects linear model was
justified.
Table 2a shows the results of the model for pre-
dicting hippocampal atrophy rate, which was highly
significant (p < 0.0001). Significant or borderline sig-
nificant (p < 0.10) covariate predictors were age at
baseline, education, ApoE4 alleles, and duration of
ChEI and memantine treatment. Significant or bor-
derline significant predictors of reduced hippocampal
atrophy rate related to CFLN treatment were: 1)
greater homocysteine lowering by CFLN (homocys-
teine �); 2) longer CFLN versus NoCFLN treatment
duration; and 3) milder severity (FAST stages ≤3
compared to FAST stages ≥4). CFLN treatment dura-
tion was also a significant random effect.
Figure 1a shows the predicted mean hippocam-
pal atrophy rates and 95% confidence bands of the
HHcy+CFLN, and NoHHcy+NoCFLN groups. Ini-
tially the predicted hippocampal atrophy rate was

greater (more negative) for the HHcy+CFLN group
than for the NoHHcy+NoCFLN group (p = 0.0000).
However, the rate of hippocampal atrophy decreased
over time in the HHcy+CFLN group to be 4.25
times slower than the NoHHcy+NoCFLN group
(slope = 0.42 versus 0.08 mm3/y.: p < 0.024). After
2.25
years,
the
hippocampal
volumes
of
the
HHcy+CFLN and NoHHcy+NoCFLN groups were
similar.
Predicting annual rate of cortical atrophy
Table 2b shows the results of the hierarchical
model for predicting cortical atrophy rate. Overall,
the model significantly predicted cortical atrophy
rate (p = 0.008), and did so significantly better than
a linear regression of the same model (p = 0.039).
Significant or borderline significant predictors were
the presence of ApoE4 alleles, CFLN (Yes/No), and
duration of CFLN. The net effect of CFLN was due
to the combination of these two opposing effects.
Baseline homocysteine level, as a random effect,
significantly improved prediction of cortical atrophy
rates for individual subjects.
Figure 1b shows the predicted mean cortical atro-
phy rates and 95% confidence bands of the HHcy+
CFLN and NoHHcy+NoCFLN groups. Initially
the cortical atrophy rate of the HHcy+CFLN
group
was
significantly
greater
(more
nega-
tive) than that of the NoHHcy+NoCFLN group
(p = 0.045). However, the predicted cortical atro-
phy rate of the HHcy+CFLN group decreased to
be 11.2 times slower than that of the NoHHcy+
NoCFLN group (slope = 4.27 versus 0.35 mm3/y.:
p < 0.0001). After 2.5 years of CFLN, the pre-
dicted cortical atrophy rates of the HHcy+CFLN and
NoHHcy+NoCFLN groups were similar.

all, the model was highly significant in predicting
forebrain parenchymal atrophy rate of CVD patients
(p < 0.00005), with significant covariate predictors
of age ≥ 65, CVD diagnosis, ChEI treatment dura-
tion, and memantine treatment (yes/no). Duration
of NoCFLN, was borderline significant, and CFLN
treatment duration was significant; both increased
forebrain parenchymal atrophy rates.

and CVD diagnosis significantly reduced forebrain

The net effect of CFLN treatment in CVD patients
was examined using linear combinations of CFLN
versus NoCFLN treatment duration and a 5-point
lowering of homocysteine for the HHcy+CFLN
group. Two years of CFLN treatment slowed fore-
brain parenchymal atrophy rate by 8.7 mm3/y, and
four years of CFLN treatment accelerated it by –6.5
mm3/y; these rates however, were not significantly
different from 0 (p > 0.4). For 2 and 4 years of
NoCFLN treatment, forebrain parenchymal atrophy
rates accelerated by –31.4 mm3/y and –39.5 mm3/y
respectively, and were highly significant (p < 0.0005).

mal atrophy rates and their 95% confidence bands

NoHHcy+NoCFLN groups.
DISCUSSION
Primary outcomes
The main finding of the present study is that CFLN
treatment of HHcy in either AD or CVD patients
for 2 or more years significantly delayed cortical
and hippocampal atrophy compared to no CFLN
treatment in no HHcy patients. For CVD patients
only, CFLN treatment of HHcy significantly slowed

forebrain parenchyma atrophy rates compared to no
CFLN treatment of no HHcy. The timing of the slow-
ing of hippocampal and cortical atrophy due to CFLN
is consistent with studies of the effect of B-vitamin
treatment of HHcy on brain atrophy [9, 18]. Those
studies found that 2 or more years of B vitamin ther-
apy slowed brain atrophy. In a separate study, a 2-year
treatment period also was needed to reduce the rate of
cognitivedeclineinmildcognitiveimpairment(MCI)
patients with HHcy treated with B vitamins [7]. Using
causalhierarchicalBayesiannetworks,thisstudyalso
demonstrated a causal relation between homocys-
teine lowering and reduced cortical atrophy, cognitive
and functional impairment. Our previous study using
the current study patients [14] also showed that slow-
ing of cognitive decline required at least 1 year of
CFLN therapy.
Forebrain parenchymal atrophy rates were signif-
icantly reduced in the HHcy+CFLN group only for
CVD patients. CVD-induced cognitive impairment
is primarily associated with microvascular disease,
which reduces blood flow to white matter, and has
been shown to significantly increase white matter
atrophy and ischemic white matter changes in HHcy
patients and in cognitively normal adults, 55 years
and older, with CVD [19, 20]. Cortical atrophy is
also linked to microvascular disease. For example,
a longitudinal study of 276 patients with CADASIL
(a genetic disorder associated with severe small ves-
sel cerebrovascular disease) identified 9 patients who
developed only a single new lacunar infarct [21]. In
these 9 patients, cortical areas that send or receive
axons through the locus of the infarct showed atrophy.
This study supports the use of measures of cortical
and white matter atrophy as an indirect measure of
vascular pathology, particularly in the presence of
white matter ischemia, lacunar infarcts or cerebral
hemorrhages.
The selective effect of CFLN in reducing fore-
brain parenchymal atrophy only in HHcy patients
with CVD may be due to a greater proportion of white
matter in the forebrain compared to hippocampus and
cortex.
The selective CFLN treatment effect on forebrain
parenchymal atrophy rate in HHcy patients with CVD
was proportional to the degree of homocysteine low-
ering (homocysteine �). HHcy impairs nitric oxide
mediated vasodilation [22], which restricts cerebral
blood flow to the brain areas furthest from the
heart, (i.e., white matter and subcortical nuclei). It
is therefore plausible that CFLN reduces forebrain
parenchymal atrophy by lowering homocysteine,
which restores normal functioning of nitric oxide
mediated vasodilation, and minimizes white matter
atrophy and ischemia.
Structure and functional effects of CFLN
treatment in HHcy
A fundamental tenet of biology is that structure
is related to function, and function is related to
structure. The present study shows that sustained
homocysteine lowering associates with reduced rates
of hippocampal, cortical, and forebrain parenchymal
brain atrophy. Our previous study of the same sample
showed that homocysteine lowering associates with
reduced cognitive decline in ADRD patients [14].
Conjointly, these findings support the hypothesis that
the homocysteine lowering effect of CFLN reduces
rates of brain atrophy and of cognitive decline in
ADRD patients.
The structure-function hypothesis is that CFLN
reduces brain atrophy, which reduces the rate of
cognitive decline. At a coarse level, HHcy lower-
ing associates with reduced rates of brain atrophy
and less cognitive decline, after adjusting for con-
founding factors [23]. A causal relation between
HHcy lowering and reduced rates of brain atrophy
and cognitive decline in AD patients has also been
inferred using causal Bayesian network analysis [7].
With regard to CVD, HHcy has been associated with
forebrain parenchymal atrophy, reduced white matter
volume, and slowing of cognitive processing speed
[19]. These findings again support the hypothesis
linking structural and cognitive changes to HHcy.
At a finer level, a number of psychiatric disorders,
when untreated, associate with hippocampal atro-
phy plus hippocampally-mediated cognitive deficits
in declarative, spatial, and contextual memory perfor-
mance [24]. The present study’s findings, combined
with our previous study on HHcy and cognitive
decline, contribute to the body of literature support-
ing the hypothesis of a causal relation between HHcy
lowering, reduced rates of regional brain atrophy, and
slowing of cognitive decline in MCI or dementia due
to AD or CVD.
Homocysteine level and treatment effect
The findings on HHcy management cannot be
extrapolated to treating patients with normal homo-
cysteine levels. There are no studies of the effects
of lowering normal homocysteine levels on brain
atrophy. However, one retrospective study of 37,442
 W.R. Shankle et al. / CerefolinNAC Therapy Reduces Brain Atrophy
1081
patients found that hypo-homocysteinemia patients
had a much higher incidence of idiopathic peripheral
neuropathy [25]. There is also a widely cited, ran-
domized, double blind trial of B-vitamin treatment,
in which there was no treatment effect on cognition
for patients in the study who had normal baseline
homocysteine levels [26].
Other possible mechanisms underlying CFLN
treatment effect
Effect of N-Acetyl-Cysteine
Some of the possible mechanisms underlying the
CFLN treatment effect that are not shared by B-
vitamins are mediated by N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC).
Since 87% of the HHcy+CFLN group took CFLN
with NAC for some or all of the study, it is
useful to consider its potential influence on this
study’s outcomes. NAC is a precursor of the neu-
ronal antioxidant, glutathione, which is not found
in B-vitamins. Glutathione functions to regulate
immune function, reduce inflammation, minimize
oxidative and nitrosative stress, maintain intracellular
signaling networks, reduce cytochrome c-mediated
apoptosis; promote neuron survival, and regulate
the methionine cycle’s epigenetic control of gene
expression [30–32]. As such, glutathione depletion
is implicated in the pathophysiology of various neu-
roimmune disorders, including depression, chronic
fatigue syndrome, Parkinson’s disease, traumatic
brain injury (TBI), and possibly AD. Basic research
has also shown that NAC replenishes glutathione
levels to protect against hypoxia, protein misfold-
ing, oxysterol-mediated amyloid-� 1–42 production,
and apoptosis [33–36]. CFLN may therefore have
different treatment effects on cognitive and struc-
tural changes in AD and CVD than the B-vitamins,
because of the combined effects of CFLN on HHcy
and on glutathione replenishment.
Clinical studies of the effects of NAC are lim-
ited, but support the hypothesis that NAC-mediated
glutathione replenishment is clinically meaningful
in AD, and some other conditions. A phase II,
double blind, randomized trial of 106 AD patients
compared cognitive and symptom severity outcomes
for placebo versus treatment consisting of folate,
alpha-tocopherol, S-adenosyl methioinine, acetyl-L-
carnitine, and NAC, for 3 or 6 months, followed
by open-label treatment for 6 months. There was
statistically significant improvement at 3 months in
a constructional praxis task (Clox), and in overall
dementia severity (Dementia Severity Scale), plus
no decline below baseline for all subjects during
six months of the open-label phase [37]. Eighty-one
US soldiers actively deployed in Iraq, who had suf-
fered mild TBI due to blast exposure in the field,
were randomized to NAC or placebo and treated
for 7 days. After 7 days of NAC compared to
placebo, soldiers had significantly greater resolution
of TBI symptoms of dizziness, headache, hearing,
loss, memory loss, sleep disturbance, and cognitive
impairment [38]. Major depression is another dis-
order whose pathophysiology includes, but is not
limited to antioxidant stress. A multicenter, double
blind, randomized trial of 76 major depressive disor-
der patients used MR spectroscopy to measure levels
of glutathione, glutamate-glutamine, N-acetyl aspar-
tate, and myoinositol in anterior cingulate cortex
during trial week 12. These results support the antiox-
idant effect of NAC in major depressive disorder.
These studies support the hypothesis that glutathione
replenishment in pathophysiologies ranging from
depression to TBI to AD has clinically measurable
effects.Theyprovideoneexplanationforwhytheout-
comes of studies with CFLN may differ from those
with B vitamins in similar patient populations.
Possible interaction effects between CFLN,
memantine, and cholinesterase inhibitors
There is evidence of CFLN interaction with
memantine and ChEIs, which may confer addi-
tional beneficial effects. However, given the fact that
all study patients were treated with stable doses
of memantine and a ChEI, the current treatment
group differences cannot be accounted for by folate-
memantine or folate-ChEI interactions.
At the cellular in vitro level, memantine interacts
synergistically with folate to reduce mitochondrially-
mediated apoptosis by 60% compared to 10% and
22% for memantine or folate alone [39]. At the ani-
mal model level, transgenic AD mice treated with
memantine combined with folate memantine and
folate showed better spatial memory performance,
less neuronal damage, and more upregulation of
genes involved in neurogenesis, neural differentia-
tion, memory, and neurotransmission than untreated
mice, as well as mice treated with either folate or
memantine alone [40]. Thus, there is basic research
evidence for an interaction between folate and
memantine that may contribute to reduced atrophy
and less cognitive decline in AD and other disorders
affected by these disease mechanisms.
Interaction effects between CFLN and ChEIs are
less consistently found. One randomized, double
 1082
W.R. Shankle et al. / CerefolinNAC Therapy Reduces Brain Atrophy
blind, placebo controlled study of vitamins B6 and
B12, and folate supplementation in mild to moder-
ately demented AD patients who had normal B12
and folate levels at baseline, and were concomitantly
treated with a ChEI found no significant group dif-
ferences in ADAS-Cog or functional activities after
6 months of treatment [41]. In contrast, another ran-
domized, double blind, placebo controlled trial of
folate supplementation in 57 demented AD patients
concomitantly treated with a ChEI found signifi-
cant group differences in the Instrumental Activities
of Daily Living and Social Behavior scores of the
National Institute of Clinical Excellence scale but no
group differences between Mini-Mental State Exam-
ination scores [42]. The interactions between B vita-
mins or NAC and ChEIs await further clarification.
Study limitations
This study has several limitations. These limita-
tions can be addressed by: 1) conducting a larger,
randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study
for at least two years; 2) collecting data on potentially
confounding factors not available for the present
study such as alchole intake [43], and adjusting for
them; and 3) examining the effect of NAC inde-
pendently of the B vitamins. Potential endogenous
confounding factors for which data were collected in
this study were dosing and ADRD severity.
The present study used doses of L-methylfolate
and B12 that were respectively 10 and 4 times larger
than the folate and B12 doses used in other regional
brain volumetric studies of HHcy treatment with B
vitamins [6, 7, 44]. Whether such dosing difference
could significantly affect regional brain atrophy rates
in HHcy-treated patients is not known and should
be studied. There are no studies on the effect of
cognitive severity and HHcy on brain atrophy, but
there are previous studies of the effects of B vitamin
treatment of HHcy on cognition. In one randomized
trial of mild to moderately demented AD with HHcy,
folate and B12 supplementation for 2 years had no
effect on specific cognitive tasks but showed a signif-
icant effect on global cognition [45]. Another study
showed that HHcy treatment with B-vitamins for 2
years improved cognition more in milder severity
patients [7]. The most extreme example of the impact
of severity on HHcy response was reported among
asymptomatic, untreated HHcy females in midlife;
their late life ADRD risk assessed 35 years later was
increased by 1.7-fold [46].
CFLN management of HHcy in cognitively
impaired patients significantly reduced rate of hip-
pocampal and cortical atrophy, and significantly
reduced rate of forebrain parenchymal atrophy in
CVD. These findings parallel the cognitive findings
in the same cohort of ADRD patients with HHcy
managed with CFLN and retrospectively compared to
NoHHcy+NoCFLN controls. CFLN contains distinct
bioactive forms of B vitamins in addition to N-acetyl-
cysteine, which may contribute to the treatment effect
in HHcy ADRD patients. These results warrant fur-
ther investigation of CFLN in managing HHcy in a
variety of cognitive disorders for at least two years.
