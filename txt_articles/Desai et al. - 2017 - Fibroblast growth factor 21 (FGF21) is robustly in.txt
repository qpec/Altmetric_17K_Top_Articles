ABSTRACT
Objective: Excess ethanol consumption has serious pathologic consequences. In humans, repeated episodes of binge drinking can lead to liver
damage and have adverse effects on other organs such as pancreas and brain. Long term chronic consumption of ethanol can also result in
progressive alcoholic liver disease and cirrhosis. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a metabolic regulator with multiple physiologic functions.
FGF21 is a novel biomarker for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in humans and limits hepatotoxicity in mice. Therefore, we explored the
possibility that FGF21 plays a role in response to ethanol consumption in both humans and mice.
Methods: We used a binge drinking paradigm in humans to examine the effect of acute ethanol consumption on circulating FGF21. We adapted
this paradigm to evaluate the acute response to ethanol in mice. We then examined the role of FGF21 on liver pathology in two models of chronic
ethanol consumption in both wild type (WT) mice and mice lacking FGF21 (FGF21-KO).
Results: Acuteethanolconsumption resulted in a robust induction ofserumFGF21after 6 h in bothhumans and mice.Serum ethanol peaked at1 h in
both species and was cleared by 6 h. Ethanol clearance was the same in WT and FGF21-KO mice, indicating that FGF21 does not play a major role in
ethanol metabolism in a binge paradigm. When FGF21-KO mice were fed the LiebereDeCarli diet, a high fat diet supplemented with ethanol, a higher
mortality was observed compared to WT mice after 16 days on the diet. When FGF21-KO mice consumed 30% ethanol in drinking water, along with a
normal chow diet, there was no mortality observed even after 16 weeks, but the FGF21-KO mice had significant liver pathology compared to WT mice.
Conclusions: Acute or binge ethanol consumption significantly increases circulating FGF21 levels in both humans and mice. However, FGF21
does not play a role in acute ethanol clearance. In contrast, chronic ethanol consumption in the absence of FGF21 is associated with significant
liver pathology alone or in combination with excess mortality, depending on the type of diet consumed with ethanol. This suggests that FGF21
protects against long term ethanol induced hepatic damage and may attenuate progression of alcoholic liver disease. Further study is required to
assess the therapeutic potential of FGF21 in the treatment of alcoholic liver disease.

 1. INTRODUCTION
Over the last decade, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) has emerged
as a critical metabolic regulator. The hormone is synthesized by
multiple tissues including the liver, pancreas, adipose tissue, and
muscle and exerts its action on several target tissues [1]. The FGF21
protein sequence is conserved across a wide range of mammalian
species; however, its physiologic actions can be distinct. For example,
hepatic expression of FGF21 rises dramatically in mice that are fasting
or consuming a ketogenic diet and is accompanied by increased
circulating FGF21 levels [2,3]. In contrast, humans consuming keto-
genic diets have no changes in serum FGF21 levels [4]. In addition,
fasting in humans for 18e24 h also has no effect on serum levels,
while fasting for 72 h in men is associated with a decline in circulating
FGF21 [4]. Two studies examining longer term fasting in women for 7
and 10 days report increased FGF21 levels. As this is accompanied by
higher levels of hepatic transaminases, this rise may represent a stress
response [5].
In contrast to the discordant responses between mice and humans to
fasting and ketogenic diets, hepatic fat accumulation leads to a
consistent increase in FGF21 hepatic gene expression and a 3e4 fold
increase in circulating levels, reported in both humans and mice
[4,6,7]. Interestingly, the response of FGF21 to fructose is also similar
in both mice and humans. In lean healthy humans and in individuals
with metabolic syndrome, acute oral loading of fructose leads to a
robust increase in circulating FGF21 within 2 h, which declines over
the ensuing 5e6 h [8]. In mice, FGF21 is elevated after an acute
gavage of fructose and also after fasting-refeeding with a high fructose
diet; this increase appears to be mediated by the transcription factor
ChREBPb [9]. Similarly, protein restriction leads to increased FGF21 in
both species [10]. In addition to responding to dietary manipulations
and hepatic fat accumulation, FGF21 expression in the liver increases
after exposure to hepatic stressors such as acetaminophen [11].
Chronic ethanol consumption is known to be lipotoxic and is associated
with accumulation of hepatic fat [12]. While alcoholic liver disease
(ALD) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have distinct
characteristics [13], they also share similar pathologies and can
progress to fibrosis and cirrhosis and increase predisposition to he-
patocellular carcinoma [14]. Considering the similar pathology
observed in NAFLD and ALD, we hypothesized that ethanol con-
sumption might also increase expression of FGF21.
We first tested this hypothesis in humans, measuring circulating
FGF21 after binge ethanol consumption, which resulted in a 40-fold
induction of serum FGF21 in humans 6 h after exposure to ethanol.
A similar time course and robust increase in FGF21 levels was
observed in mice orally gavaged with ethanol. Despite the increase
observed, FGF21 did not appear to play a role in acute ethanol
clearance or in ethanol induced changes in hepatic gene expression,
as these were similar in WT and FGF21-KO mice.
In contrast, deletion of FGF21 was associated with significant hepatic
pathology after long term exposure to ethanol. When ethanol was
consumed in the context of a high fat diet, lack of FGF21 was asso-
ciated with excess mortality within 16 days. After chronic exposure to
ethanol in drinking water and a chow diet, WT mice demonstrated no
obvious systemic adverse effects after 16 weeks. However, FGF21-KO
mice showed increased hepatic injury. These data suggest that FGF21
plays a hepato-protective role in the context of chronic ethanol
consumption.
As there are data suggesting that FGF21 plays a role in ethanol
preference in both mice and humans [15,16], we evaluated preference
for ethanol in different FGF21 mouse models. In contrast to previous
reports, we found no difference in ethanol preference between mice
lacking FGF21 and WT mice, but did confirm that excess FGF21 leads
to reduced consumption of ethanol.
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1. Human studies
To evaluate the effects of acute ethanol consumption on FGF21 in
humans, biospecimens were sourced from the human study “Effects of
Fish Oil and Red Wine on Oxidative Stress Biomarkers”, registered at
clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00682318, aimed to evaluate the interaction
between fish oil on oxidative stress markers after ethanol consumption
[17,18]. The clinical study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of the University of Pennsylvania (IRB# 807069) and by the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA IND# 79,750; sponsor-investigator C.S.).
Healthy non-smoking volunteers, n ¼ 7 (4 females, 3 males),
38.4 � 13.2 years, BMI < 25, with no history of alcohol dependence
or liver disease were recruited through local advertisements. A sum-
mary of the inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, and specific dietary
restrictions
before
enrollment
in
the
study
is
described
in
Supplementary Table 1. Subject characteristics are summarized in
Supplementary Table 2. Routine medical history, physical exam, and
laboratory work (hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis) were
assessed at screening and on completion of the study.
2.1.1. Fish oil and alcohol study
In a longitudinal study design, volunteers received a placebo drink at
baseline (diet ad libitum), followed by consumption of either a pla-
cebo drink or ethanol (0.4 g/kg body weight), randomized for order,
after supplementation with 2 g/day of Lovaza, a synthetic pre-
scription fish oil (omega-3-acid ethyl esters) for 5e6 weeks
(41.9 � 0.4 days). Subjects were then randomized to either continue
Lovaza at a higher dose of 10 g/day, or were switched to receive
Solgar, a safflower oil supplement at a dose of 10 g/day. After a
mean 27.8 � 0.5 days of supplementation subjects were challenged
with ethanol at the higher dose of 0.9 g/kg body weight. As high
doses of fish oil supplements increase exposure to heavy metals
including mercury, participants were asked to refrain from additional
fish foods during the study.
For each of the alcohol and placebo administrations an overnight fast
was required, allowing water ad libitum. The morning after, volunteers
were admitted to Center of Human Phenomic Science (CHPS) at the
University of Pennsylvania approximately 2 h prior to ingestion of
ethanol or placebo (approximately 07:00). The University of Pennsyl-
vania Investigational Drug Service (IDS) prepared and dispensed all
drinks using the body weight recorded during the screening visit. Body
weight was again assessed prior to each alcohol/placebo adminis-
tration to ensure that weight did not differ by more than 5% from initial
weight. Alcohol drinks were prepared from 200-proof pharmaceutical
grade purified ethanol. The ethanol content was calculated based on
the appropriate dose for each subject adjusting for body weight, and
sugar free lemonade (with/without additional sugar free fruit flavors)
was used to dilute the drink to a total volume of 240 ml. Placebo and
alcohol solutions were each provided in six Yorker-tip bottles, each
bottle holding 40 ml. Subjects drank one bottle every 10 min, i.e. at 0,
10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 min, thus a total of 240 ml were ingested by
each subject. Biospecimen collection was timed to occur at baseline
and at 6 h and 24 h post ethanol/placebo administration. Compliance
to ethanol/placebo administrations was assessed by direct oversight at
the bedside as well as real-time monitoring blood ethanol levels with a
breath analyzer.

 Study participants received standardized meals at specified times:
breakfast 2 h � 1 h after the end of the ethanol/placebo administra-
tion, lunch and dinner 4 h � 1 h and 6 h � 1 h after the end of the
ethanol/placebo administration, respectively.
2.1.2. Binge ethanol challenge
The protocol described above was amended to obtain approval to
measure serum FGF21 levels after administration of ethanol at 0.9 g/
kg body weight in human subjects not receiving fish oil supplements
and eating ad libitum. Blood was collected at baseline, then at 0.5, 1,
1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, and 24 h post administration. Volunteers were
admitted to CHPS the night before the ethanol administration
(16:30 � 1:00 h) and fasted overnight with ad libitum access to water.
Food intake during the inpatient stay was standardized to deliver low or
no fructose, drinks without added sugar (e.g. milk, water, sugar free
soda), and food low in carbohydrates (turkey and cheese sandwich on
whole wheat bread supplemented with nuts, almonds, peanuts, and/or
cheese and/or vegetables). The first meal subjects received on the day
of ethanol administration was lunch at 13:00, while dinner was served
at 18:00 on both days.
2.1.3. Human serum analysis
Human FGF21 was measured using a commercially available Quan-
tikine human FGF21 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&D
Systems, Minneapolis MN). Glucose, triglycerides and alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) activity were measured using the ACE Glucose
Kit, ACE triglycerides kit and ACE ALT Kit respectively (Alfa Wasserman,
West Caldwell NJ).
2.2. Animal studies
2.2.1. Mouse maintenance and diets
All experiments were carried out on 8e16 week old male or female
mice with the following genotypes: WT (C57BL/6J), FGF21-KO, and
transgenic mice overexpressing FGF21 (FGF21-OE). For experiments
only involving WT mice, mice were purchased from Jackson Labora-
tories (Bar Harbor ME). Originally, FGF21-KO and FGF21-OE mice were
generated at Eli Lilly Research Laboratories (Indianapolis IN) and have
been described previously [19,20]. For experiments involving FGF21-
KO or FGF21-OE mice, founder mice for each colony were back-
crossed onto the C57BL/6J line at least 10 times before the initiation of
these studies and were used with their littermate controls. FGF21þ/�
matings were used for all our experimental mice. Occasionally, one
single generation of WT � WT and KO � KO breeders were used.
Unless otherwise specified, mice were provided with ad libitum access
to water and the standard animal facility chow diet (6.7% fat, 23.6%
protein and 56% carbohydrate in the form of starch 29.4%, 2.5%
sucrose) (LabDiet 5008 e Pharmaserv, Framingham MA). The mice
were kept under a 12 h light: 12 h dark cycle and an ambient tem-
perature of 22 � 2 �C. All procedures were in accordance with Na-
tional Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Animals
and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston MA).
2.2.2. Binge drinking protocol
Male WT mice were fasted for 2.5 h before receiving 3 gavages of
either ethanol at 3.5 g/kg or an equivalent volume of distilled water.
Mice were kept on a heating pad throughout the experiment to prevent
hypothermia. Ethanol or water gavaged mice were sacrificed at each of
the following time points after the first gavage e 1.5 h, 3 h, 6 h, 9 h.
Serum and livers were collected and stored at �80 �C until analyzed.
In a separate experiment, WT and FGF21-KO male mice were fasted
for 2.5 h before receiving an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of 20%
ethanol (v/v) and tail blood was collected for serum at the following
time points e 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h.
2.2.3. Models of chronic ethanol consumption
2.2.3.1. Ethanol in liquid LiebereDeCarli diet. Male WT and FGF21-
KO mice were initially given ad libitum access to the liquid Liebere
DeCarli control diet (CTRL) without ethanol supplementation in order to
acclimate to liquids. Thereafter, the mice received ethanol supple-
mented LiebereDeCarli Diet (LDC) [21]. The CTRL diet had a caloric
profile of 49% Carbohydrate, 15.1% Protein, 35.9% Fat with a total
fiber content of 4.3% (Bio-Serv F1259SP, Flemington NJ). The LDC diet
had a caloric profile of 35.5% Ethanol, 13.5% Carbohydrate, 15.1%
Protein, 35.9% Fat with a total fiber content of 7.2% (Bio-Serv
F1258SP, Flemington NJ). Liquid diets were prepared fresh every day.
The ethanol concentration (w/v) was gradually increased from 2%
(experimental Day 0) to 4% (Day 4) and finally 6% (Day 8). As ethanol
content was increased in the diet, maltose dextrin content (Bio-Serv
F3653, Flemington NJ) was adjusted to keep the diet isocaloric. Body
weight and caloric intake were measured daily. The experiment was
terminated on Day 16 as observed mortality reached 28% in the
FGF21-KO-LDC group. Mice were sacrificed, and serum and livers
were collected and stored at �80 �C until further analysis. A separate
experiment was carried out only to determine the survival curve of WT
and FGF21-KO mice on LDC with 4% ethanol (w/v).
2.2.3.2. Consumption of ethanol in drinking water. Female WT and
FGF21-KO mice were provided with ad libitum access to a chow diet
and either water or 30% ethanol (v/v) for 16 weeks. Ethanol solution
was freshly prepared every few days. Body weights were measured
weekly and caloric intake was measured every day during week 1 and
week 16. After 16 weeks, the mice were sacrificed, and serum and
livers were collected and stored at �80 �C until further analysis.
2.2.4. Two-bottle taste preference test
This experiment was performed on male WT mice, FGF21-KO mice,
and FGF21-OE mice. Mice had access to two bottles (Kaytee Products,
Chilton WI), containing either water or 10% ethanol (v/v) in water. The
bottles were pre-autoclaved before the experiment and the position of
the two bottles was interchanged each day to exclude position based
learned bias. Water and ethanol intake were measured every day for 7
days. To assess the effect of exogenous FGF21, WT mice were infused
FGF21 at a dose of 24 mg/day/animal (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis IN), using
osmotic mini-pumps implanted subcutaneously (SC) as described
previously [22]. The mice were then subjected to the same two bottle
preference test as above for 3 days.
2.2.5. Mouse serum and liver assays
Mouse FGF21 concentrations were measured using Quantikine Mouse
FGF21 ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis MN). Ethanol levels were
measured using the EnzyChrom Ethanol Assay Kit (BioAssay Systems,
Hayward CA), and triglycerides were measured using the Triglyceride
Liquicolor Kit (StanBio Laboratory, Boerne TX). For liver triglyceride
content, a Folch extraction [23] was first performed on 150 mg of
frozen tissue before calorimetric analysis using the Triglyceride Liq-
uicolor Kit (StanBio Laboratory, Boerne TX).
2.2.6. Enzyme activity
Liver alcohol dehydrogenase activity was measured using the Quan-
tiChromTM Alcohol Dehydrogenase Kit (BioAssay Systems, Hayward

 CA) as per the manufacturer’s instruction. Serum ALT activity was
measured using the ALT-SGPT Liquid Kit (Pointe Scientific, Canton MI).
2.2.7. RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR
RNA was isolated from livers flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen using
Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research, Irvine CA). cDNA was
made from isolated RNA using oligo (dt), random hexamer primers and
reverse transcriptase QuantiTech RT Kit (Qiagen, Germantown MD).
Quantitative PCR was performed using the 7800HT (Applied Bio-
systems, Foster City CA) thermal cycler and SYBR Green master mix
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City CA). Relative mRNA abundance was
calculated and normalized to levels of the housekeeping gene 36B4.
2.2.8. Histological analysis
A portion of the left, right, and median hepatic lobes was removed and
fixed in 10% formalin at 4 �C overnight. Paraffin embedding and
sectioning was performed by the Histology Core at Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center. Sections with a thickness of 5 mm were
stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin for histological analysis, and Sirius
Red to specifically assess for fibrosis. Slides were analyzed by two
experienced liver pathologists (I.A.N. and H.G.V) in a double blind
fashion. Each slide was graded based on the NAFLD Activity Score
(NAS) [24], which looks at degree of steatosis, inflammation, and
ballooning, as well as the METAVIR Score [25], which assesses the
degree of fibrosis.
2.3. Data analysis
Data are shown as mean � standard error of the mean (SEM). Time
course experiments were analyzed for significant differences using a
two-way ANOVA with repeated measures followed by Bonferroni’s
post-hoc test for individual comparisons. Single point measures for
four-way studies were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA followed by
Bonferroni’s post-hoc analysis test for individual comparisons. Single
point measures for two-way studies were analyzed using a two-tailed
unpaired t-test. Significance is designated by asterisks with *P < 0.05,
**P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001, or designated by letters
where means that do not share a common letter are significantly
different from each other at P < 0.01.
3. RESULTS
3.1. Binge ethanol consumption induces FGF21 in humans in a
time and dose dependent manner
Data from the first cohort, which was enrolled in the crossover study,
showed that fatty acid supplements alone did not elevate FGF21
levels, regardless of the supplement type and dose (Figure 1A).
Baseline serum FGF21 was 55 � 14 pg/ml and is consistent with
previous reports [4,6]. Following binge ethanol consumption, FGF21
levels
were
dramatically
elevated
in
comparison
to
subjects
consuming a placebo drink (Figure 1A). The peak in FGF21 was
proportional to the amount of ethanol consumed (Figure 1A) as
subjects receiving 0.4 g/kg ethanol peaked at 700 � 348 pg/ml
(P ¼ 0.03), while subjects receiving 0.9 g/kg ethanol peaked at
2194 � 328 pg/ml (P < 0.0001). To further evaluate the temporal
relationship between ethanol consumption and FGF21 serum levels in
humans, we added a cohort of 4 subjects who did not receive fatty
acid supplements (Experimental design: Supplementary Figure 1A).
These subjects demonstrated a 40-fold increase in serum FGF21
Figure 1: Binge ethanol consumption in humans increases circulating FGF21 levels. Binge consumption of ethanol elevates FGF21 in humans. In subjects receiving fatty acid
supplements, a placebo drink has no effect on circulating FGF21 (A). Binge consumption of the lower ethanol dose (0.4 g/kg) in subjects receiving supplements causes an 11-fold
increase in circulating FGF21 at 6 h. Remarkably, binge consumption of a higher ethanol dose (0.9 g/kg) results in a dramatic 40-fold elevation in circulating FGF21 at 6 h in these
subjects (A). This effect is also consistent in subjects not receiving any fatty acid supplements, where the higher ethanol dose (0.9 g/kg) causes a similar 40-fold rise in circulating
FGF21 at 6 h (B). Serum FGF21 levels increase over the first 6 h and then decline, returning to normal at 24 h (B). In these same subjects, serum ethanol peaks 1 h after the binge
episode and is cleared from the circulation by 8 h (C). Serum triglycerides are elevated between 5 and 10 h after the ethanol challenge (D). Data represented as Mean � SEM;
n ¼ 4e11 subjects. Significance was determined with a two-way ANOVA with repeated measures followed by a post-hoc analysis using Bonferroni’s test. Significance is
designated by asterisks with *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.

 levels 6 h after the ethanol challenge (FGF21 levels e 0 h:
88 � 22 pg/ml; 6 h: 3536 � 1890 pg/ml) (P ¼ 0.05) (Figure 1B).
The fold increase in FGF21 and the precise timing of the peak levels
between subjects was somewhat variable (Supplementary Figure 2A),
reiterating earlier observations on the inter-individual differences of
FGF21 induction after a fructose challenge [8]. We then examined
ethanol clearance. Serum ethanol peaked 1 h after the ethanol
challenge in all subjects and was cleared from the system within 8 h
(P < 0.05) (Figure 1C, Supplementary Figure 2B). Over the ensuing
24 h, serum triglycerides increased at 5 h and remained elevated
until 10 h after the ethanol challenge (P < 0.05) after which they
returned to baseline (Figure 1D). Glucose stayed within the physio-
logical range, between 80 and 120 mg/dl (0 h: 92 � 3 mg/dl; 6 h:
112 � 11 mg/dl; 24 h: 94 � 3 mg/dl). ALT levels in the serum also
remained unchanged within the physiological range (0 h: 8 � 0.6 IU/l;
6 h: 7.5 � 0.9 IU/l; 24 h: 7.7 � 1.5 IU/l).
3.2. Acute ethanol consumption induces FGF21 in wild type mice
in a time dependent manner
As observed in humans, acute ethanol exposure in male WT mice
correlated with a significant time dependent increase in circulating
FGF21 (Experimental Design: Supplementary Figure 1B). FGF21
significantly increased 3 h after the first gavage, peaked at 6 h, and
returned to baseline by 9 h (P ¼ 0.05, P ¼ 0.003) (Figure .2A). Serum
ethanol levels in WT mice gavaged with ethanol peaked at 1.5 h,
remained elevated at 3 h, and were cleared from the circulation or
metabolized within 9 h after the first gavage (P < 0.0001) (Figure 2B).
Hepatic expression of FGF21 mRNA was increased at 6 h after the first
gavage (P < 0.03) (Figure 2C). Transcription factor ChREBPb (Figure 2D)
was induced at 1.5 h and 3 h following ethanol gavage (P < 0.001). In
contrast, expression of the transcription factor peroxisomal proliferator-
activated receptor alpha (PPARa) was markedly reduced at both 3 h and
6 h after the first ethanol gavage (P < 0.05) (Figure 2E).
Figure 2: Acute ethanol feeding in mice increases circulating FGF21 levels. WT mice gavaged with ethanol have increased serum FGF21 levels that peak at 6 h (A). Serum
ethanol levels peak at 1.5 h and are sustained until 3 h (B). Ethanol gavage in WT mice causes a time dependent increase in hepatic FGF21 gene expression (C). Carbohydrate
induced transcription factor ChREBPb is upregulated (D), and a simultaneous downregulation of transcription factor PPARa and its target is observed (E, K). Fatty acid synthesis
genes are upregulated (F, G, H) whereas fatty acid oxidation genes are downregulated or remain unchanged (I, J). Data represented as Mean � SEM; n ¼ 8e10 mice/group.
Significance in (A) and (B) was determined with a two-way ANOVA with repeated measures followed by a post-hoc analysis using Bonferroni’s test. Significance in (C)e(K) was
determined with a two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post-hoc test for individual comparisons. Significance is designated by asterisks with *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001,

 An increased expression of fatty acid synthesis genes was observed
6 h after acute ethanol gavage in WT mice, namely fatty acid synthase
(FAS) (P < 0.01), sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-
1c) (P < 0.05) and steroyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) (P < 0.05)
(Figure 2FeH). Simultaneously, there was a time dependent reduction
in expression of fatty acid oxidation gene carnitine palmitoyl trans-
ferase 1 alpha (CPT1a) (P < 0.01), (Figure 2I), while fatty acid
oxidation gene carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1b (CPT1b) and PPARa
target gene uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) remained unchanged
(Figure 2J and K).
3.3. Chronic ethanol consumption in LiebereDeCarli diet leads to
excess mortality and hepatotoxicity in FGF21-KO mice
Before starting the chronic experiments, baseline ethanol clearance
rates were measured in WT and FGF21-KO male mice consuming a
chow diet. After a single IP injection of ethanol (20% v/v), peak levels
and ethanol clearance/metabolism rates were the same in WT and
FGF21-KO mice. Serum ethanol levels peaked 0.5 h post injection and
were cleared within 2 h (Figure 3A). In another experiment, mice were
fasted for 12 h followed by refeeding with the liquid LiebereDeCarli
(LDC) diet (4% ethanol w/v); and serum ethanol and serum ALT levels
were measured 4 h after the diet was made available. Both serum
ethanol (Figure 3B) and ALT levels (WT-LDC: 18.0 � 1.5 IU/l; KO-LDC:
22.1 � 1.9 IU/l) were the same in both groups indicating that the acute
response to ethanol is not affected by FGF21.
We first evaluated the role of FGF21 in chronic ethanol consumption
using the LDC diet. WT and FGF21-KO mice were gradually exposed to
the LDC diet, progressively increasing ethanol content to 2, 4, and 6%
(w/v) (Experimental Design: Supplementary Figure 1C). At 6% ethanol
concentration, we noted a mortality of 28% in FGF21-KO mice by day
16. Therefore, the remaining animals were sacrificed and livers were
subsequently analyzed. Chronic ethanol consumption in the LDC diet
led to a significant increase in hepatic FGF21 expression in WT-LDC
mice compared to the WT-CTRL group (WT-CTRL: 1.0 AU � 0.2 vs
WT-LDC: 2.7 � 0.7 AU; P ¼ 0.03) (Figure 3C). Hepatocyte damage
was observed specifically in FGF21-KO-LDC mice, as indicated by
elevated serum ALT (WT-LDC: 17.60 � 2.4 IU/l; FGF21-KO-LDC:
54.51 � 13.6 IU/l, P ¼ 0.01) (Figure 3D). Significantly higher serum
ethanol levels were noted in FGF21-KO-LDC mice compared to WT-
LDC mice after 16 days (Figure 3E). This was consistent with the
lower activity of alcohol dehydrogenase which metabolizes ethanol to
acetaldehyde (WT-LDC: 9.9 � 0.3 IU/l/mg liver; FGF21-KO-LDC:
7.1 � 0.9 IU/l/mg liver; P ¼ 0.008) (Figure 3F). Ethanol metabolizing
pathways are limited to a few oxidizing enzymes. Hepatic gene
expression of alcohol dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (ADH1, 2), acetaldehyde
dehydrogenase1a1 (ALDH1a1), acyl-coenzyme A synthetase short-
chain family member 2 (ACSS2), which catalyzes acetaldehyde con-
version to acetate, and cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily E member
1 (Cyp2E1), a mitochondrial enzyme that metabolizes ethanol
(Figure 3G), were all increased in WT mice on the LDC diet compared to
WT mice on the CTRL diet. Induction of these genes was significantly
attenuated in FGF21-KO mice on the LDC diet (Figure 3G) and was
associated with increased accumulation of ethanol in the serum
(Figure 3E).
To better assess the toxic effect of ethanol in FGF21-KO mice, survival
rate was determined in these mice while consuming 4% LDC. Excess
unexplained mortality was observed in FGF21-KO-LDC mice compared
to WT-LDC mice as observed over 33 days (Percent survival of WT-
LDC: 83.3%; Percent survival of FGF21-KO-LDC: 28.5%, P ¼ 0.04)
(Figure 3H). These results demonstrate that chronic ethanol exposure
in the context of a high fat LDC diet leads to excess mortality in FGF21-
KO mice compared to WT mice. Deficiency of FGF21 is associated with
limited induction of ethanol oxidizing genes possibly contributing to the
increased mortality.
Histological examination of livers showed relatively normal liver in WT-
CTRL and WT-LDC mice (Figure 4A i, ii, iv, v). However, very prominent
and severe steatosis and fibrosis were observed in FGF21-KO-LDC
mice (Figure 4A iii, vi). Histopathological scoring confirmed severe
macrovesicular
steatosis
and
fibrosis
in
FGF21-KO-LDC
mice
(Figure 4B). Ballooning degeneration and hypertrophic changes were
not observed in histology. Pathological analysis did not reveal any
obvious signs of sudden mortality such as hemorrhage or congestion.
Hepatic gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, cluster of
differentiation 68 (CD68), tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa), chemokine
monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1), and macrophage In-
flammatory Proteins-1a (MIP1a) was significantly elevated in FGF21-
KO mice exposed to LDC compared with WT mice on the diet
(Figure 4C).
3.4. Chronic ethanol consumption in drinking water leads to
moderate hepatic damage in FGF21-KO mice
Since the LDC diet model was associated with significant mortality in
FGF21-KO, we selected an alternative model to study the potential
effects of FGF21 in chronic ethanol consumption. Female mice were
exposed to 30% ethanol (v/v) in drinking water and a normal chow diet
for 16 weeks (Experimental Design: Supplementary Figure 1D). Ter-
minal body weight, caloric intake, and locomotor activity were not
different within and between the groups (Supplementary Figure 3Ae
D), and no excess mortality was observed.
Serum FGF21 was higher in WT mice consuming ethanol (WT-water:
312.8 � 37.4 pg/ml; WT-Ethanol: 1020 � 142.1 pg/ml; P ¼ 0.003)
as was hepatic FGF21 expression (WT-water: 1.0 � 0.17 AU; WT-
Ethanol: 3.46 � 0.69 AU; P ¼ 0.006) (Figure 5A and B). Since
ethanol is cleared rapidly, serum was sampled 3 h into the dark
cycle (21:00 h), when the mice are expected to be actively feeding
and drinking. Female WT and FGF21-KO mice had identical serum
ethanol levels indicating that FGF21-KO mice have no excess ethanol
accumulation in the blood (Figure 5C). Hepatic gene expression of
ethanol metabolizing enzymes were found to be very similar across
groups (Figure 5D). Serum cholesterol, serum triglycerides, and
serum
glucose
levels
remained
unchanged
(Supplementary
Figures 3EeG).
Although mice appeared grossly healthy at 16 weeks, pathology was
observed in the liver. Sections, stained with hematoxylineeosin were
evaluated for histological features of steatosis, inflammation, and
hepatocellular injury. Increased inflammation and progressive macro-
and micro vesicular steatosis, hypertrophic changes, and ballooning
degeneration were noted specifically in the FGF21-KO-Ethanol group
compared to other groups (Figure 6A and B ieiv, B). More pronounced
fibrosis was observed in FGF21-KO-Ethanol mice compared to other
groups as shown by Sirius Red staining (Figure 6A and B veviii).
Hallmark histopathological features of ALD such as lipofuscin laden
macrophages (Figure 6A iv a), Mallory Bodies (Figure 6A iv b) and
foamy degeneration (Figure 6A iv c) were specifically observed in 50%
of FGF21-KO mice. Total triglyceride content in the liver, as measured
by Folch Extraction, showed increased accumulation of triglycerides
only in the FGF21-KO-Ethanol mice; this was consistent with histo-
logical observations (Supplementary Figure 3H). At the level of hepatic
gene expression, lipogenic gene FAS was increased in only in the
FGF21-KO-Ethanol mice while SCD1 was similarly induced in both WT-
Ethanol and FGF21-KO-Ethanol mice compared to mice drinking water
(Supplementary Figure 4A).

of ethanol after a single IP injection (20% v/v) is identical in WT and FGF21-KO mice consuming chow (A). Following a 12 h fast, WT and FGF21-KO mice fed ethanol in the Liebere
DeCarli (LDC) diet (4% w/v) have similar serum ethanol levels 4 h post re-feeding (B). Chronic ethanol consumption in LDC diet (6% w/v) for 16 days results in significant elevation

 It is noteworthy that no pathognomonic pathology of ethanol damage
was observed on histological analysis of livers from WT-Ethanol mice.
Histological markers of ethanol damage were only observed in FGF21-
KO-Ethanol mice as noted above. This was consistent with gene
expression data as FGF21-KO mice tended to have increased hepatic
expression of fibrotic markers such as collagen, type I, alpha 1 (Col1a1),
tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP1) and matrix metal-
lopeptidase 2 (MMP2) (Supplementary Figure 4B). They also showed a
similar increased trend to hepatic expression of inflammatory markers
such as CD68, IL1b, and TNFa (Supplementary Figure 4C).
Figure 4: FGF21-KO mice develop worse liver pathology when consuming ethanol in the LiebereDeCarli diet. Hematoxylin & Eosin staining of liver sections demonstrate
relatively normal histology in WT mice consuming the CTRL diet or the LDC diet (A ieii). In contrast, severe steatosis is observed in FGF21-KO on the LDC diet (A iii). Sirius Red
staining reveals pronounced fibrosis in FGF21-KO-LDC mice (A vi) compared to WT-CTRL or WT-LDC mice (A ivev). Double blind histopathological scoring confirms the excess liver
damage in FGF21-KO-LDC mice, as indicated by specific macrosteatosis and fibrosis scores (B). In addition, FGF21-KO-LDC mice also have higher expression of inflammatory
markers compared to WT-CTRL or WT-LDC mice (C). Data represented as Mean � SEM; n ¼ 6e8 mice/group. Significance in (B) and (C) was determined with a two-way ANOVA
and Bonferroni’s post-hoc analysis test for individual comparisons. Significance is designated by letters where means that do not share a common letter are significantly different

 3.5. FGF21 reduces preference for ethanol
In a two bottle preference test, both WT mice and FGF21-KO mice
demonstrated the same, immediate, strong preference for 10%
ethanol over water (WT: P < 0.0001; FGF21-KO: P < 0.0001)
(Figure 7A and B). By contrast, mice with increased circulating FGF21
levels preferred water over 10% ethanol. This included mice which
genetically over-expressed FGF21 (P < 0.01) (Figure 7C) as well as
wild type mice infused with FGF21 via subcutaneous osmotic mini-
pumps for 3 days (P < 0.05) (Figure 7D).
4. DISCUSSION
FGF21 is a complex metabolic regulator that plays a role in both the fed
and fasted state [2]. Dissecting the various roles of FGF21 is compli-
cated as it is synthesized by multiple tissues and acts on several target
tissues. For example, FGF21 expression is increased in the liver with
fasting, fructose challenge, and protein restriction [3,9,10]. FGF21 can
be induced in inguinal fat depots upon cold exposure [22] and in
muscle that is under stress induced by a mitochondrial myopathy [26].
Understanding FGF21 is further complicated by the fact that not all
stimuli that induce FGF21 in mice have similar effects in humans. Thus
far, fructose challenge [8,9], protein restriction [10,27], muscle my-
opathies [26], fatty liver [4,6,7] and pancreatitis [28e30] are consis-
tent in elevating FGF21 levels in both species.
FGF21 has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic ef-
fects in the liver and pancreas. FGF21 deficient mice consuming a
lipotoxic diet show exacerbated liver damage [31,32] which can be
prevented by exogenous FGF21 infusion. Similarly, FGF21 deficient
mice have exacerbated experimental pancreatitis [33], while FGF21-KO
mice consuming a conventional obesogenic high fat, high sucrose diet
develop exaggerated peri-portal pancreatic inflammation [29].
Ethanol consumption has been reported to induce hepatic trans-
aminases (ALT and AST), alkaline phosphatase, inflammatory markers,
fibrotic markers, and carbohydrate induced genes in the liver [34e36].
While it is known that FGF21 may play a role in ethanol preference in
both humans and mice, an acute endocrine response to ethanol
consumption in the liver has not been previously reported in either
species. Here we show for the first time that acute ethanol con-
sumption induces significant increases in circulating FGF21 in both
humans and mice.
Binge ethanol consumption results in a 40-fold induction of circulating
FGF21 in humans, substantially higher than the previously reported 4-
fold FGF21 induction observed with a fructose challenge in both lean
and obese individuals [8] (Supplementary Figure 2A). While an acute
fructose challenge in human increases circulating FGF21 within 2 h,
ethanol peak values are noted later, typically between 6 h and 9 h after
a “binge” episode. Interestingly, the FGF21 time course in response to
acute ethanol is similar in mice and humans. Despite the rise in
circulating FGF21, we found that FGF21 does not affect ethanol
clearance, as mice lacking FGF21 have similar serum ethanol con-
centrations as well as rates of clearance after ethanol gavage as
compared to WT mice.
To investigate the potential role of FGF21 in ethanol induced liver
pathology, we evaluated the consequences of chronic ethanol expo-
sure in mice lacking FGF21. In contrast to a previous report [37], we
found that chronic ethanol consumption at 6% (w/v) concentration
Figure 5: Chronic ethanol consumption in drinking water along with a chow diet has no adverse effect on the ethanol metabolizing capacity of FGF21 KO mice. WT
mice consuming 30% ethanol in drinking water (v/v) and a chow diet for 16 weeks have significantly elevated serum FGF21 levels (A) and increased hepatic FGF21 expression (B).
After 16 weeks, serum ethanol levels are similar in WT and FGF21-KO mice consuming ethanol (C). Hepatic gene expression of ethanol oxidizing enzymes is the same in all groups
(D). Data represented as Mean � SEM; n ¼ 5e6 mice/group. Significance in (A), (B), (C) was determined with a two-tailed unpaired student t-test. Significance in (D) was
determined with a two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni’s post-hoc analysis test for individual comparisons. Significance is designated by asterisks with **P < 0.01.

 mixed in a high fat LDC diet, was associated with more severe hepatic
damage and unexplained early mortality within a period of 16 days in
FGF21-KO mice. FGF21-KO-LDC mice had higher levels of serum
ethanol compared to WT-LDC mice and this was associated with a
reduced expression of ethanol metabolizing genes. Accumulation of
ethanol reflects the impaired capacity of FG21-KO mice to oxidize the
ethanol in this chronic consumption model. This may be an indirect
effect of impaired hepatic function, suggesting a disruption of carbo-
hydrate and lipid metabolizing functions of FGF21.
Given the high rate of morbidity and mortality we observed with this
diet, we examined the effect of FGF21 deletion in an alternate model.
Chronic ethanol consumption, consumed at 30% (v/v) in drinking water
and accompanied by a standard chow diet, did not lead to mortality in
FGF21-KO mice over a 16 week period. Nevertheless, hepatic damage
was observed in FGF21-KO as reflected by more severe fibrosis and
the development of hallmark features of ALD including Mallory bodies,
foamy degeneration, and lipofuscin laden macrophages on liver his-
tology [38]. These histological parameters were not observed in WT
mice. These changes were accompanied by increased hepatic gene
expression of both inflammatory and fibrotic markers in FGF21-KO
mice compared to WT mice. It is noteworthy that after 16 weeks of
ethanol consumption, WT mice showed no pathologic changes. Thus,
ethanol consumption in the absence of high dietary fat led to a gradual
development of hepatic damage in FGF21-KO mice. However, in this
model, despite evidence of evolving liver damage in FGF21-KO ani-
mals, serum ethanol levels were the same as those noted in WT mice.
This indicates that at the time point evaluated, both groups of animals
had the same capacity to metabolize ethanol and implies that hepatic
dysfunction was not yet sufficiently severe to impair ethanol meta-
bolism in the FGF21-KO animals.
We attribute the difference in morbidity and mortality in mice lacking
FGF21 between the two diets to the fact that ethanol and high fat diet
Figure 6: Ethanol consumption in drinking water leads to evolving hepatic damage in FGF21-KO mice. After 16 weeks, there are no detectable signs of inflammation,
steatosis, and fibrosis in WT-Water mice (A i, A v, B) or WT-Ethanol mice (30% ethanol) (A ii, A vi, B). FGF21-KO-Water also have normal liver histology (A iii, A vii, B). In contrast,
FGF21-KO-Ethanol mice drinking 30% ethanol have hepatic damage including inflammation, steatosis, hypertrophy, and fibrosis as indicated by histological analysis (A iv, A viii, B).
This includes the presence of hallmark pathological features of alcoholic liver disease such as lipofuscin macrophages (thick arrow) (A iv a), Mallory bodies (thin arrow) (A iv b), and
foamy degeneration of hepatocytes (arrow head) (A iv c), only seen in FGF21-KO mice consuming ethanol. Data represented as Mean � SEM; n ¼ 5e6 mice/group. Significance in
(B) was determined with a two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni’s post-hoc analysis test for individual comparisons. Significance is designated by letters where means that do not share
a common letter are significantly different from each other at P < 0.01. Scale: 100 mm (A ieix), 20 mm (A iv aec).

 have a synergistic negative effect on fatty liver disease, an interaction
that has been demonstrated in humans [39]. Although the disease
progression is different in the two dietary models, both demonstrate
hepatic damage in FGF21-KO mice, suggesting a protective role of
FGF21 in ethanol induced liver damage.
It might be expected that mice lacking FGF21 would have an aversion
to ethanol as consumption ultimately leads to liver damage. In contrast
to previously published reports, we observed no difference between
WT and FGF21-KO mice in ethanol preference [15]. However, mice
overexpressing FGF21 had reduced ethanol consumption compared to
WT mice, consistent with previous reports [40]. This effect was also
observed when WT were infused subcutaneously with FGF21, which
led to a reversal of preference for ethanol over water during the course
of the infusion.
Our data suggest that FGF21 has a dual role in ethanol metabolism.
Acutely, FGF21 acts centrally to inhibit ethanol consumption and the
acute rise in FGF21 in both rodents and humans may mediate this
function. Chronically, the rise in hepatic FGF21 expression may serve the
now well-established hepatic anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic role, in
part by leading to increased fatty acid oxidation and limiting lipid accu-
mulation [31,32]. Future studies are required to explore these actions of
FGF21 further. Taken together, these effects suggest the potential value
of FGF21 as a therapeutic agent for alcoholic liver disease [41].
