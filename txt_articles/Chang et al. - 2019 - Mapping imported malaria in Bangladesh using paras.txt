Abstract For countries aiming for malaria elimination, travel of infected individuals between
endemic areas undermines local interventions. Quantifying parasite importation has therefore
become a priority for national control programs. We analyzed epidemiological surveillance data,
travel surveys, parasite genetic data, and anonymized mobile phone data to measure the spatial
spread of malaria parasites in southeast Bangladesh. We developed a genetic mixing index to
estimate the likelihood of samples being local or imported from parasite genetic data and inferred
the direction and intensity of parasite flow between locations using an epidemiological model
integrating the travel survey and mobile phone calling data. Our approach indicates that, contrary
to dogma, frequent mixing occurs in low transmission regions in the southwest, and elimination will
require interventions in addition to reducing imported infections from forested regions. Unlike risk
maps generated from clinical case counts alone, therefore, our approach distinguishes areas of
frequent importation as well as high transmission.

 Introduction
A global decline of malaria in recent decades has led to a push for complete national elimination of
human malaria parasites in 21 countries by 2020 (WHO, 2018). In elimination and pre-elimination
settings, malaria transmission is often highly heterogeneous geographically (Bousema et al., 2012;
Carter et al., 2000; Sturrock et al., 2016), and policy-makers must focus on reducing transmission
in remaining endemic foci, while protecting areas where malaria has been effectively controlled from
imported infections that threaten to reintroduce parasites and reignite transmission (Cotter et al.,
2013; Churcher et al., 2014). These tasks require different interventions, so understanding how pat-
terns of regular travel to and from malaria endemic regions of a country contribute to the spread of
malaria is a critical component of elimination planning. Measuring the spatial spread of malaria
remains technically challenging, however, due to frequent asymptomatic and undetectable infections
(Lindblade et al., 2013), as well as the inherent challenges associated with epidemiological surveil-
lance in rural areas among highly mobile populations.
Decisions about how to allocate resources for malaria control and elimination are generally based
on reports from hospitals, clinics, community health workers (CHWs) and non-governmental organi-
zations (NGOs) around the country, which provide a measure of the incidence of symptomatic cases
(WHO, 2007; Moonen et al., 2010). In areas with high mobility, however, the reporting health facil-
ity may not accurately capture local transmission, instead detecting imported infections that have
been acquired elsewhere. Traditionally, patient travel surveys have been the principal method for
identifying imported cases, but surveys can be unreliable and limited in scope, and importation can-
not always be confirmed even when a travel history is accurate (Wesolowski et al., 2014). We and
others have used spatially explicit epidemiological models– for example, parameterized using
mobile phone data– to estimate ‘sources and sinks’ of parasites and the impact of travel on the
spread of malaria (Wesolowski et al., 2012). These methods show promise, but do not provide
highly spatially resolved estimates in regions with low cell tower density, such as in forested or
sparsely populated regions, and may suffer from ownership biases.
There is also a growing interest in the routine use of sequencing to genotype parasites, which
may provide insights into the spatial spread of malaria, particularly in low transmission settings
where imported infections that sustain remaining hotspots must be addressed and in places where
drug resistance poses a threat (Amato et al., 2018; Busby et al., 2016; Imwong et al., 2017;
Karunaweera et al., 2014; MalariaGEN Plasmodium falciparum Community Project et al., 2016;
Miotto et al., 2015; Obaldia et al., 2015; Taylor et al., 2017; Tun et al., 2015). However, in spite
of decreasing costs, the use of genetic data is currently constrained by the lack of appropriate meth-
ods for analysis. Plasmodium falciparum infections are often composed of multiple different parasite
clones, which undergo sexual recombination in the mosquito (Mzilahowa et al., 2007). As a result,
phylogenetic and population genetic methods normally applied to the analysis of non-recombining
organisms cannot be used. In addition to applying human population genetic tools to malaria para-
sites (Chang et al., 2012; Lawson et al., 2012; Miotto et al., 2013; Patterson et al., 2006;
Pritchard et al., 2000), an emerging field of promising new approaches, such as THE REAL McCOIL,
hmmIBD, or isoRelate, are being developed to explicitly address these characteristics of malaria
infection (Taylor et al., 2017; Chang et al., 2017; Henden et al., 2018; Schaffner et al., 2018).
Conceptually, genetic and epidemiological approaches should complement each other – genetic
data encodes information about the relatedness of parasites and mixing patterns between different
parasite populations, while epidemiological data provides insights into clinical cases and the patterns
of transmission. For viral pathogens like the influenza virus, where recombination does not obscure
relationships between lineages, phylodynamic frameworks have been developed for inferring migra-
tion patterns and identifying the factors contributing to the migration rate (Lemey et al., 2014;
Nelson et al., 2015; De Maio et al., 2015; Vaughan et al., 2014). Although it is possible to mea-
sure population differentiation on continental scales for malaria (Miotto et al., 2015), elimination
programs often require inferences on smaller spatial scales, which are currently more challenging
because of frequent recombination and the complex epidemiological dynamics of the parasite. In
particular, on local spatial scales genetic signals may not be easily resolved because parasites are
likely to be highly related, and comparisons between many pairs of populations become

 computationally prohibitive (De Maio et al., 2015; Vaughan et al., 2014; Rasmussen et al., 2014).
Developing methods that leverage insights from genomic data, epidemiological information, and
mobility data sources such as travel survey or mobile phone data, is therefore an important goal for
malaria, particularly if the collection of clinical samples for genetic analysis and travel data can be
incorporated into routine surveillance workflows to support decision making for control programs.
The National Malaria Elimination Programme (NMEP) in Bangladesh currently estimates the bur-
den of malaria using symptomatic case counts aggregated at administrative level 3 (upazila) or 4
(union). Typical of malaria in Southeast Asian countries, much of the transmission is thought to occur
in forests and forest fringes where the principal vectors abound (Bhatia et al., 2013). The difficulties
of surveillance in hard-to-reach forested areas complicate decisions about where to target transmis-
sion-reducing interventions (often focused on vector control) and how to find and treat imported
cases as Bangladesh moves towards elimination. Moreover, Bangladesh – one of the countries that
plan to eliminate malaria nationally – borders the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) (WHO, 2017b;
Haque et al., 2014), where evidence of resistance to first line treatment for malaria (artemisinin com-
bination therapy, or ACT) has been found in all countries (WHO, 2017a). Although resistance to
artemisinin and to ACT partner drugs has not been found to date locally, Bangladesh is a potential
point of passage in the spread of drug resistance out of the GMS, so monitoring drug resistance
markers is crucial.
Epidemiological models of malaria designed to understand spatial transmission are often based
on clinical incidence and seroprevalence estimates; data and methods required for integrating
insights about importation from other data sources, including genetic data, are currently lacking
(Daniels et al., 2015). Mobility patterns derived from mobile phone data are difficult to access, and
rarely coincide temporally with epidemiological and genetic data, but could in theory provide real-
time estimates of population movements. We collected and analyzed paired genetic, travel survey,
and epidemiological malaria case data across the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) region of Bangladesh,
in combination with estimated population mobility patterns from mobile phone calling data. We
developed a simple metric to quantify genetic mixing from parasite genetic barcode data. Geo-
graphic patterns of genetic mixing were then compared to estimates of malaria importation from a
mathematical model, based on clinical epidemiological data and on mobility data from travel surveys
and mobile phone records. We show that, taken together, these data sources provide evidence of
heterogeneous transmission outside the high-incidence forested areas, and of substantial importa-
tion of parasites throughout the CHT. We propose that this type of data integration and analytical
pipeline could help national control programs effectively target resources for malaria elimination.
Results
The map of clinical incidence from the NMEP for 2015 and 2016 shown in Figure 1A in the CHT sup-
ports the hypothesis that transmission is highest in the eastern, forested region, similar to other
countries in the GMS with forested border areas (Figure 1B). The location of the reporting health
clinic may not reflect local acquisition of infection, however, particularly in regions like Bangladesh
where laborers, forest-workers, and military personnel may travel frequently in and out of high trans-
mission areas, but report to clinics in low transmission areas. We aimed to map remaining transmis-
sion foci in the CHT; in particular to identify areas outside forested regions where transmission is
being sustained, rather than imported from the forest, since these areas should be targeted by
transmission reduction interventions. To this end, we enrolled 2090 patients with confirmed malaria,
attending 57 hospitals and clinics across the malaria-endemic region (see Figure 1—figure supple-
ment 1 for a map of sample distribution). All patients answered a travel questionnaire and their
dried blood spots were collected on filter paper. In total, parasite genotypes of 1412 patients were
obtained successfully. These data were combined with reported incidence for the region, and data
on aggregated daily movement patterns from 2.4 million mobile phone subscribers over 6 months
across the CHT (see Materials and methods).
Disparate data sets identify broad division of transmission foci
We first analyzed each type of data separately, focusing on quantifying signals of spatial connectivity
and on measuring transmission intensity (Figure 1C,D,E). Given the importance of distinguishing
between the forested border regions – where most malaria is thought to occur – and less forested

 areas elsewhere, for clarity we defined forested areas as those with >50% forest coverage. In the
travel survey, 31% (N = 654) of malaria positive individuals reported living outside forested areas. Of
these individuals, the majority did not report any travel to forested areas (66%, N = 434), suggesting
that either individuals were acquiring infections outside these areas, or that the travel survey did not
capture all forest travel. The survey indicated a general separation between the north and south por-
tions of the endemic region, with fewer people traveling between these two regions. Within the
regions, however, substantial travel was reported between the high incidence forested areas and
the lower incidence ones (Figure 1D). Similarly, by simply connecting those pairs of unions where we
identified parasites with identical genetic barcodes, a broad north-south division of the CHT region
clearly emerged, as did connections between forested and non-forested areas (Figure 1C). Tempo-
rally, parasite pairs with identical genetic barcodes were significantly closer in time than those that
were not identical (medians = 16.5 vs. 145 days, Mann-Whitney test p-value<2�10�16). Conversely,
we found that other genetic diversity metrics, except for drug resistance-related markers, showed
limited spatial resolution (see Figure 1—figure supplements 2 and 3). Roughly consistent with the
north-south divide, mobility estimates derived from mobile phone calling data suggested a high
amount of travel in the coastal areas around the cities of Chittagong and Cox’s Bazar, with little
travel between these areas (Figure 1E). This separation into two main transmission foci was consis-
tent with the larger geographic distance between these areas of the CHT, but provided little insight
into the extent of transmission heterogeneity on more local spatial scales.
To assess whether patterns of genetic relatedness among parasites showed signals consistent
with survey- or mobile phone-based estimates of mobility, we analyzed all parasite pairs, along a
continuum of genetic similarity, with respect to mobility outcomes. As expected, genetically similar
parasites (fewer differences in genetic barcode comparisons) were more likely to come from the
same residence unions (Figure 2A). For parasites from different unions, more related parasites were
more likely to come from unions where direct travel had been reported in the survey (Figure 2B; see
Materials and methods). To ensure this signal was not obscured by local effects, since both travel
and genetic similarity is expected to be high between neighboring unions, we separated the data
into unions less than 20 km apart and unions more than 20 km apart (Figure 2—figure supplement
1). The association shown in Figure 2B was mainly driven by unions that were �20 km apart, indicat-
ing that travel is responsible for closely related parasites in more geographically separated unions.
Remarkably, closely related parasites that were neither from the same location nor from locations
with direct travel reported were more likely to come from unions with indirect travel reported to a
shared third location (Figure 2C). Using the travel survey data at the individual patient level instead
of population level, we found that individuals infected with closely related parasites were signifi-
cantly more likely to report living, working, or traveling to the same locations, confirming the correla-
tion between the genetic and travel survey data (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). Comparing the
genetic data to travel measured using mobile phone data, we found that genetically similar parasites
that were not from the same locations were more likely to come from locations with greater inferred
connectivity between them (Figure 2D), even though the majority of travel measured was in less for-
ested areas. Therefore, although the travel survey and mobile phone data represent different geo-
graphic and population coverage, and disparate sample sizes (Figure 2—figure supplement 3),
spatial signatures of connectivity were generally consistent with the genetic data.

 Genetic and model-based evidence of transmission in low incidence
areas
To map transmission heterogeneities on smaller spatial scales, these rich data sources can be ana-
lyzed using more sophisticated approaches. We developed a metric designed to quantify the
amount of parasite genetic mixing – indicative of frequent parasite importation and recombination
between different parasites from different locations – in different regions. This index was calculated
for each location with respect to all other locations as a risk ratio; specifically, the ratio of risks that
parasites were genetically similar given that they were far away and nearby. To identify this index,
we used the empirical relationship between genetic similarity and geographic distance for this
region, so the thresholds defined would be setting-specific if rolled out routinely as part of surveil-
lance programs (see Materials and methods). In brief, we quantified the decline of parasite genetic
similarity with geographic distance, uncovering a robust signal; pairs of parasites sampled from
unions that are geographically closer were more likely to be genetically similar (Figure 3A). In addi-
tion to the enrichment of genetically similar parasites in spatial proximity, there was a temporal sig-
nal: parasite pairs with SNP differences smaller than 10% were significantly closer in time than those
with SNP differences greater than 10% (medians = 14 vs. 145 days, Mann-Whitney test p-val-
ue<2�10�16). Using the empirical relationship between geographic and genetic distances, we
assumed a uniform prior on geographic distance and calculated the probability of geographic dis-
tances between patients given different levels of genetic similarity (Figure 3—figure supplement 1;
see Materials and methods). This allowed us to define a CHT-specific ‘genetic mixing index’ to iden-
tify higher sharing of parasite barcodes between samples from relatively distant locations, indicative
of high gene flow or importation (Figure 3B and Figure 3—figure supplement 3; see Materials and
methods). Figure 3B maps this index across the CHT, showing heterogeneous patterns of mixing in
the southwestern region, with high mixing regions indicating frequently imported infections, and low
genetic mixing suggesting predominantly local transmission. In contrast, we did not observe ele-
vated genetic mixing in the north (see robustness analysis in Figure 3—figure supplement 2 and
Supplementary file 1 for 95% confidence intervals of the index).
Genetic measures based on SNP barcodes were able to identify unions with a high likelihood of
importation events, but not the origin of imported infections since sharing genetic similarity did not
provide information about the direction of movement. Epidemiological models that describe direc-
tional travel patterns may be used to combine reported incidence with data from travel surveys or
mobile phone data to reconstruct routes of importation. We used mobility estimates from the survey
and from mobile phone data to infer the amount of travel between locations in a simple epidemio-
logical model that predicts the rate of infections moving between unions and mapped the resulting
malaria source and sink locations (see Materials and methods, Figure 4A,B, and Figure 4—figure
supplements 1 and 2). We compared the relative contribution of imported infections to local trans-
mission in each union and predicted that locations in the southwestern area of the CHT had the high-
est proportion of imported cases, using both the travel survey and mobile phone data (Figure 4A,
B). The mobility patterns derived from mobile phone data suggested more infections were being
imported overall, however qualitatively both mobile phone data and travel surveys identified over-
lapping areas of the country where the top locations of importations were occurring. The genetic

more likely to be from unions with higher direct travel (>0.1%) estimated from mobile phone data.

 mixing index therefore provides an independent confirmation that extensive parasite flow is occur-
ring in the highly populated southwestern region of the CHT, while the epidemiological model –
parameterized using travel survey data and mobile phone data – provides insights into the sources
of imported infections.
Generating combined transmission maps
Combining unions with a high genetic mixing index together with unions with a high proportion of
imported cases estimated from the epidemiological models, we created an updated risk map for
malaria transmission in the CHT (Figure 5D). Both the genetic mixing index and the epidemiological
models suggest frequent mixing in the southwest of the CHT, in Cox’s Bazar district (Figures 3B and
4A,B). The epidemiological model predictions were roughly consistent with the unions exhibiting a
high genetic mixing index (Figure 4C). Additionally, we identified frequent importation within the
southwest region from epidemiological models parameterized using both travel survey and mobile

areas, particularly unions within Cox’s Bazar district (Figure 5A, Figure 5—figure supplements 1
and 2). The model parameterized by mobile phone data also identified the forested areas as a
source, and in addition, suggested that parasites were imported from more populated, lower trans-
mission areas in the west (Figure 5B). Since travel surveys and mobile data had quite different

 geographic coverage and different biases (Figure 1C,D), some discrepancies are expected. Never-
theless, these analyses support the ideas that a) forested areas are an important source of imported
infections, consistent with current dogma, but b) human movement around densely populated
regions with relatively low transmission appears to contribute substantially to heterogeneous trans-
mission across the southwest of the CHT (Figure 5C). This means that resources for elimination
should be targeted in these areas, in addition to the forested regions. The updated map
(Figure 5D) highlights the regions which were not identified in the incidence map (Figure 1A), for
example. Our results also suggest that importation routes occur separately in the north and south of
the Chittagong region (Figure 5C and Figure 5—figure supplement 1), implying that a staged elim-
ination strategy could be effective.

 Discussion
Routine surveillance for malaria among control programs is primarily based on prevalence estimates
and/or clinical incidence reported by hospitals, clinics, community health workers and non-govern-
mental organizations. The geographic distribution of clinical cases may not reflect patterns of trans-
mission, particularly in areas hosting highly mobile populations, where importation of parasites is
common. Identifying the true foci of transmission is particularly important in elimination settings,
such as Bangladesh. A number of approaches have been suggested to augment risk maps based on
incidence data, including molecular surveillance and epidemiological models parameterized by new
data streams, such as mobile phone data. Here, our goal was to assess whether a combination of
these approaches could provide actionable insights for control programs. As a complement to a sim-
ple map of clinical incidence, or model-based geospatial maps based on incidence and prevalence
estimates (https://map.ox.ac.uk), this combined approach illustrated that, while the eastern forested
regions are indeed contributing imported infections to the lower transmission areas in the south-
west, substantial local importation and genetic mixing is also occurring in these highly populated
areas along the southwestern part of the CHT. This suggests that, while targeting interventions to
forested areas is a key strategy for elimination, it might not be successful unless the mixing between
low transmission settings in the southwest region is also addressed. We propose that, with appropri-
ate sampling strategies, parasite genetic analysis could provide actionable insights for national con-
trol programs and help evaluate the success of elimination programs.
Our samples came from symptomatic patients who presented at a health facility, which would be
the norm for routine reporting to the NMEP. We therefore did not include asymptomatic or subclini-
cal infections, and it is unknown to what extent the parasite in symptomatic patients are representa-
tive of the entire parasite population in this area (Searle et al., 2017). Although we were able to
enroll patients at 57 health facilities that covered a wide geographic area, these study sites only rep-
resent 59% of all CHT health facilities which report data to the NMEP. In several health facility catch-
ment areas, non-government organizations provide malaria treatment, testing, and education
outside health facilities as part of a malaria outreach initiative. In these areas, we may be under-esti-
mating true incidence, since fewer people seek malaria treatment at the government health clinics.
Although these biases may impact epidemiological modeling results, the genetic mixing index –
which may lack power when sample size is small, but is not biased by underestimating incidence –
can provide complementary insights.
In this transmission setting and geography, genetic differentiation based on genetic barcodes
between parasite populations cannot be easily distinguished by commonly used methods, such as
average pairwise difference or FST (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). Consistent with our previous
studies showing that the proportion of nearly identical genetic sequences is more sensitive to recent
migration of pathogens (Taylor et al., 2017; Chang et al., 2016), in our data the proportion of para-
sites with nearly identical genetic barcodes was highly associated with geographic distance. This
allowed us to develop a genetic mixing index, which may provide context-specific information about
gene flow. However, the thresholds used for calculating this index would need to be determined in
each setting independently, because the association between geographic distance and genetic simi-
larity can vary between settings. This index could also be used at the individual level, to identify
infections that are likely to be imported. We found three cases with a genetic mixing index greater
than 1, suggesting that they were likely to be imported and, consistently, there was reported travel
between their residence unions and the unions they shared similar barcodes with. The reliance of the
genetic mixing index and other spatial approaches on nearly-identical parasites – which are rare, but
hold the most meaningful genetic signals – means that small sample sizes and large uncertainty are
inevitable challenges to their routine use. Although increasing sample size would improve our esti-
mates, adding more SNPs to the analysis is unlikely to reduce uncertainty of the index, since the pat-
terns of relatedness are an intrinsic feature of malaria epidemiology in this region. Nevertheless, in
combination with other modeling approaches, genetic data can yield insights that are not attainable
any other way – particularly in the context of elimination planning. As molecular surveillance
becomes more widespread, clearly establishing the strengths and limitations of genetic data will be
critical.
Mobile phone data and travel surveys are different from each other in terms of scale, geographic
coverage, and granularity of data about human mobility in this context (Wesolowski et al., 2018).

 Our travel survey provides detailed, individual-level information about infected individuals, although
its quality is dependent on the respondent’s ability to accurately recall their travel over the past two
months. Although we included specific questions to help with recall bias, such as asking explicitly
about travel to the forested areas, these biases likely still exist and may have limited our ability to
infer parasite movement. Overall, travel survey data were sparse at the union level, and many indi-
viduals reported no travel (287 out of 2,090), or only travel within a single union (1240 out of 2,090).
In contrast, mobile phones provide large volumes of data about the connectivity of the general pop-
ulation, but no individual-level information, and only in locations where cell towers exist. The con-
trasting geographic coverage and scale of the two sources of data on human mobility – mobile
phone and travel survey data – lead to different estimates of parasite importation. Mobile phone
data provides insights into large-scale population flows, but is limited to regions with cell towers,
while travel survey data provide detailed information about a small number of malaria-infected indi-
viduals. Both data sources are biased, but together can provide complementary insights into the
population dynamics underlying the spread of parasites in the region. Given the difficulties associ-
ated with measuring population mobility and the importance of understanding importation in coun-
tries aiming for elimination, multiple (albeit biased) estimates of human travel provide the most
complete picture of parasite flows. Given the biases in the incidence data (discussed above), in the
epidemiological model, we chose a simple approach without having to estimate the underlying
transmission or directly incorporating vectoral capacity. Remarkably, travel patterns from both data
sources

Every epidemiological and genetic data set has inherent limitations and biases, but multiple data
layers can complement each other effectively to provide insights into different components of
malaria transmission. This study represents a first example of the utility of combining these sources
of information in the context of identifying imported infections, and we believe it shows that cost-
effective sequencing approaches can be combined with simple epidemiological models to provide a
more complete picture of malaria transmission on a subnational level.
Materials and methods
Malaria epidemiological and mobility data
Patients self-presenting to 58 health facilities across hill districts Bandarban, Khagrachari, and Ranga-
mati and adjacent coastal districts Chittagong, and Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh from January 2015 to
September 2016 and tested positive for malaria were recruited (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). In
total, 2090 individuals were included in the travel survey. The majority of these individuals were
infected with P. falciparium (N = 1,540), followed by P. vivax (N = 332), mixed infections (N = 215),
and unknown (N = 3). Trips from an individual’s residence village were quantified for work, frequent,
infrequent, forest, and international travel including the destination (geocoded to the union level,
176 unions in total were included in the analysis), number of nights spent on the trip, frequency of
travel (number of trips), and timing (when did the trip occur). Travel survey questions are listed in
Supplementary file 2. We also analyzed mobile phone calling data to estimate population-level
mobility within the CHT. Mobile phone call data records were analyzed from 1 April – 30 September
2017 where individuals were assigned their most frequently used mobile phone tower per day.
Tower locations were aggregated to the corresponding union. Travel between unions was calculated
when subscribers’ most frequently used tower location (aggregated to the union) changed between
consecutive days. Subscribers who did not change their locations were assumed to have remained in
the same location on these days. Over this time period, we calculated the average number of daily
trips between unions within the CHT using previously developed methods (Wesolowski et al.,
2015). Over half of the unions included in the travel survey included at least one mobile phone tower
(N = 147, 64%), however coverage was limited in the eastern most unions of the CHT.
The total number of confirmed (by microscopy and RDT) Plasmodium falciparum cases is reported
monthly to the NMEP (Laskar et al., 2018). These data were aggregated to the corresponding upa-
zila (N = 95) per month from January 2015 to August 2018, and were used to calculate the average
monthly malaria incidence using the estimated population sizes from the most recent census
(Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, 2011). For a subset of unions (N = 141), monthly incidence data

 was available for unions and was used in lieu of the upazila level incidence data (Figure 1A). The per-
cent of forest coverage was calculated using estimates by Hansen et al. (Hansen et al., 2013). Geo-
graphic distances were calculated as road distance between union centroids using R package
‘Geosphere’ (Karney, 2013).
Genetic analysis
We performed barcode assays on parasite samples from all of the 2090 malaria positive patients
enrolled, and successfully obtained genetic barcodes of parasite samples from 1412 individuals who
resided in 134 separate unions. Barcodes were formed from genotypes at 101 SNPs at locations
across the genome known to be highly differentiating. These SNPs are variable in all major global
geographic regions and have moderate minor allele frequencies in these populations, as well as
above average levels of between population FST. Genotypes were produced using the mass-spec-
trometry based platform from Agena (Supplementary file 4 and 6). In addition, samples were geno-
typed for known drug resistance-related markers (Supplementary file 3). We estimated complexity
of infection and population allele frequencies using THE REAL McCOIL (Chang et al., 2017) and
included both monoclonal and polyclonal samples in the analysis. The percentage of SNP difference
was calculated using the number of SNP differences divided by the total number of sites excluding
missing data and assuming that SNP difference between heterozygous call and homozygous call is
0.5.
We defined a genetic mixing index as follows:
Genetic mixing indexi ¼ Prob genetically similar j far
ð
Þ
Prob genetically similar j close
ð
Þ ¼
nf ;s
nf ;sþnf ;ns
nc;s
nc;sþnc;ns
:
For each sample from a particular union i we classified all other samples as either genetically simi-
lar or dissimilar, and calculated the number of these samples that were geographically ‘far’ or ‘close’.
The numbers were then aggregated across individuals within each union i: nf,s, nf,ns, nc,s, and nc,ns
represent the number of samples that are far (f) or close (c) and genetically similar (s) or not geneti-
cally similar (ns). Since it is more likely to observe between individuals who have physically nearby
residences, if a sample had a higher-than-expected probability of sharing genetic similarity with sam-
ples far away, it is likely that it was imported. We used samples that were ‘not genetically similar’ to
control for the effect of sample sizes. This index is expected to increase with the proportion of
imported cases and the number of ‘sources’ (see examples in Figure 3—figure supplement 3). The
95% confidence intervals were calculated as follows (Katz et al., 1978):

In this study,�17.5% SNP difference was chosen as the threshold for genetic similarity and �20
km was chosen as the threshold for geographically far because the empirical probability of
having �17.5% SNP difference above 20 km was smaller than 0.05; the threshold of >30% SNP dif-
ference was used to determine ‘not genetically similar’ parasites because the probability of observ-
ing >30% SNP difference varied minimally with geographic distance in Bangladesh (Figure 3—
figure supplement 1). Genetic mixing index >0.1 and �0.1 were classified as ‘high’ and ‘neutral’,
respectively.
The association between genetic data, travel survey, and mobile phone
data
We compared genetic data with both population-level and individual-level travel survey data. At the
population level, we examined how SNP differences (denoted by x) related to the travel survey data
and compared the empirical results with 100 permutations (Figure 2). We considered three scenar-
ios: (1) individuals living in the same union (denoted by T1), (2) individuals coming from places with
direct travel (denoted by T2), and (3) individuals coming from places with indirect travel (denoted by
T3). Two unions were considered to have ‘indirect’ travel if they were both connected by travel to
another union that had non-zero incidence. Specifically, we calculated the proportion of parasite
pairs under these three scenarios, given different SNP thresholds (denoted by S), as follows:

We excluded T1 when calculating T2, and excluded T1 and T2 when calculating T3, in order to
identify the signal associated with each scenario separately. Our results show that parasite pairs with
smaller SNP differences were more likely to come from the same unions, unions with direct, or
unions with indirect travel, than random permutations (Figure 2A,B,C), indicating that genetic data
was consistent with travel survey.
We performed a similar analysis using mobile phone data. Because almost all pairs of locations
have direct travel inferred from mobile phone data, instead of calculating the proportion of locations
with direct travel, we calculated the proportion of parasite pairs from locations with higher direct
travel (>0.1%). The results show parasite pairs with smaller SNP differences, not living in the same
unions, were more likely to come from unions with higher direct travel, indicating the association
between genetic similarity and mobile phone data (Figure 2D).
At the individual level, we calculated the odds ratio of observing nearly identical barcodes with
respect to the residence location or travel pattern was calculated as follows:
Odds ratio ¼

where C is the residence location or travel pattern (e.g., the condition that two individuals live in
the same union, or work in the same union, or travel to the same union, etc.). Nearly identical barco-
des were defined as barcodes with less than a 10% SNP difference, and ‘not nearly identical barco-
des’ was defined as barcodes with SNP differences between the 25th and 75th percentiles for all
SNP differences. Based on the estimated population allele frequencies, expected pairwise similarity
between two random parents is 0.558 and therefore the expected parent-offspring similarity after
one outcrossing event is 0.779 (=0.5 + 0.5*0.558). This indicates that the SNP difference thresholds
of 10% and 17.5% used here are conservative, falling within one outcrossing event (i.e. lower than 1–
0.779 = 22.1%) and represent high similarity and recent ancestor sharing.
Quantifying the probability of a geographic distance given a SNP
difference
To investigate the relationship between geographic and SNP distance, we considered seven geo-
graphic distance windows D= (0, 0–10, 10–15, 15–20, 20–40, 40–100, >100 km) and six SNP differ-
ence windows S= (0, 0–10, 10–17.5, 17.5–25, 25–30, 30–35%). To establish what genetic distance
alone tells us about the spatial relationships between isolates, we assumed a uniform prior with geo-
graphic distance. The inferred geographic distances (based on genetic data) can then be compared
to the true geographic distance between samples collected by the control program, to assess
whether isolates are imported or not. For all pairs of unions within a specified geographic distance
window d, the proportion of sample pairs with SNP differences within each SNP difference
window s, Prob sjd
ð
Þ, was calculated. We then calculated the probability of a geographic distance d
given a SNP difference s, Prob djs

 Modeling parasite flow using travel survey and mobile phone data
We calculated the number of trips between all pairs of unions from either the travel survey or mobile
phone data. For the travel survey data, all individuals self-reported a residence union. We aggre-
gated the trips to all other destinations by individuals for each residence union. For individuals who
did not report any travel, we assumed they remained in their residence union. Based on the design
of the travel survey, individuals could report travel for four separate reasons from their residence
location (work, forest, frequent, and infrequent trips) (Supplementary file 2). For individuals who
reported travel for fewer options, we assumed that a non-report was equivalent to remaining in their
residence union (i.e. if they only reported a travel destination for work, then for the remaining travel
questions – forest, frequent, and infrequent – we assumed that the individual was at their residence
location). We further normalized the number of trips between unions by the total number of trips
originating from each residence union had, and obtained the proportion of trips from union i to
union j for all pairs of unions, Tij, where P
j
Tij ¼ 1 for each i.
Among 176 unions which had travel survey data, 104 of them (59%) had at least one mobile
phone tower. We calculated the number of trips between unions with mobile phone towers between
consecutive days and used the average number of trips over 6 months. Similar to the travel survey,
Tij was calculated by normalizing the number of trips each union made.
Epidemiological estimates of parasite importations
We estimated the parasite flow based on travel from the residence union scaled by the relative inci-
dence in the destination union versus the residence union (see Supplementary file 5 for travel matri-
ces inferred from travel survey and mobile phone data). The proportion of infections in union i
coming from union j, Pij, was calculated as follows:
Pij ¼

We calculated a population-level measure of parasite flow, the number of cases in union i from union
j (Mij), based on the number of clinical cases in each residence union as follows:
