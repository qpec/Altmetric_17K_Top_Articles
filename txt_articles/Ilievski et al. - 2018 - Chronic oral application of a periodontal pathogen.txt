Abstract
Background
The results from cross sectional and longitudinal studies show that periodontitis is closely
associated with cognitive impairment (CI) and Alzhemer’s Disease (AD). Further, studies
using animal model of periodontitis and human post-mortem brain tissues from subjects
with AD strongly suggest that a gram-negative periodontal pathogen, Porphyromonas gingi-
valis (Pg) and/or its product gingipain is/are translocated to the brain. However, neuropa-
thology resulting from Pg oral application is not known. In this work, we tested the
hypothesis that repeated exposure of wild type C57BL/6 mice to orally administered Pg
results in neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, microgliosis, astrogliosis and formation of
intra- and extracellular amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) which are patho-
gnomonic signs of AD.
Methods
Experimental chronic periodontitis was induced in ten wild type 8-week old C57BL/6 WT
mice by repeated oral application (MWF/week) of Pg/gingipain for 22 weeks (experimental
group). Another 10 wild type 8-week old C57BL/6 mice received vehicle alone (control
group) MWF per week for 22 weeks. Brain tissues were collected and the presence of Pg/
gingipain was determined by immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy, confocal microscopy,
and quantitative PCR (qPCR). The hippocampi were examined for the signs of

 neuropathology related to AD: TNFα, IL1β, and IL6 expression (neuroinflammation), NeuN
and Fluoro Jade C staining (neurodegeneration) and amyloid beta1-42 (Aβ42) production and
phosphorylation of tau protein at Ser396 were assessed by IF and confocal microscopy.
Further, gene expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP), beta-site APP cleaving
enzyme 1 (BACE1), a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein10
(ADAM10) for α-secretase and presenilin1 (PSEN1) for ɣ-secretase, and NeuN (rbFox3)
were determined by RT-qPCR. Microgliosis and astrogliosis were also determined by IF
microscopy.
Results
Pg/gingipain was detected in the hippocampi of mice in the experimental group by immuno-
histochemistry, confocal microscopy, and qPCR confirming the translocation of orally
applied Pg to the brain. Pg/gingipain was localized intra-nuclearly and peri-nuclearly in micro-
glia (Iba1+), astrocytes (GFAP+), neurons (NeuN+) and was evident extracellularly. Signifi-
cantly greater levels of expression of IL6, TNFα and IL1β were evident in experimental as
compared to control group (p<0.01, p<0.00001, p<0.00001 respectively). In addition, micro-
gliosis and astrogliosis were evident in the experimental but not in control group (p <0.01,
p<0.0001 respectively). Neurodegeneration was evident in the experimental group based
on a fewer number of intact neuronal cells assessed by NeuN positivity and rbFOX3 gene
expression, and there was a greater number of degenerating neurons in the hippocampi
of experimental mice assessed by Fluoro Jade C positivity. APP and BACE1 gene expres-
sion were increased in experimental group compared with control group (p<0.05, p<0.001
respectively). PSEN1 gene expression was higher in experimental than control group but
the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.07). ADAM10 gene expression was sig-
nificantly decreased in experimental group compared with control group (p<0.01). Extracellu-
lar Aβ42 was detected in the parenchyma in the experimental but not in the control group
(p< 0.00001). Finally, phospho-Tau (Ser396) protein was detected and NFTs were evident in
experimental but not in the control group (p<0.00001).
Conclusions
This study is the first to show neurodegeneration and the formation of extracellular Aβ42 in
young adult WT mice after repeated oral application of Pg. The neuropathological features
observed in this study strongly suggest that low grade chronic periodontal pathogen infec-
tion can result in the development of neuropathology that is consistent with that of AD.
Introduction
Periodontitis is a disease characterized by destruction of gingiva and tooth-supporting bone
caused by an exuberant host immunological response to periodontal pathogens. The incidence
of periodontitis is estimated to be approximately 50% in human adults, with 10% having severe
periodontitis [1] and this incidence increases drastically in adults over 65 years of age [1,2,3].
Periodontitis is considered a risk factor for dementia and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) based
on a close association between the presence of periodontitis and cognitive impairment/demen-
tia in humans [4,5,6,7,8]. Notably, regular mastication, brushing and flossing can expose the

 host to bacterial products via bacteremias repeatedly throughout life [9] and bacteremias
increase with severity of the periodontitis [10,11]. Thus, periodontitis may result in repeated
exposure of distant organs such as the brain, liver and pancreas to bacteria and their products
[12,13,14].
Longitudinal studies of periodontitis are difficult to perform in humans, primarily because
chronic periodontitis being essentially irreversible, cannot be ethically induced in humans.
Furthermore subsequent monitoring of changes in cognitive impairment and concomitant
assessment of cellular and molecular neuropathologies other than in post-mortem samples are
not possible. Thus, in this study, we induced chronic periodontitis (prolonged chronic infec-
tion) in 8-week old C57BL/6 WT mice by repeated oral application of a periodontal pathogen
Pg and determined changes that occur in the hippocampus. Oral application of Pg is fre-
quently used in the field of periodontal research with various durations of application
[15,16,17,18,19]. It is important to note that in our chronic model system, we confirmed the
development of periodontitis by assessing bone loss around teeth and there were no differ-
ences in body weight and food consumption between control and experimental groups [20].
The presence of gram-negative periodontal pathogens such as Porphyromonas gingivalis
(Pg) and Treponema denticola (Td) have been identified in human post-mortem brain tissues
of Alzheimer’s Disease patients based on PCR and immunological detection of species-specific
Treponema antigen [21,22]. In brain tissue of 4 of 10 AD patients, Pg-LPS was evident in
Western blots probed with Ab1B5 which recognizes both gingipain and LPS, but not in brain
tissue from 10 control patients [22]. The periodontal status of subjects included in that study
was not determined. In addition to human post-mortem studies, animal studies have been per-
formed to determine the effects of periodontitis on the translocation of pathogens and possible
effects in the brain following oral application of a pathogen using ApoE-/- mice [23,24]. The
presence of periodontal pathogens/products in the brain was also reported based on the detec-
tion of Pg genomic DNA and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis [23,24]. These
studies did not determine the presence of periodontal pathogen/product within specific brain
cells, and thus it is not clear if pathogens or products actually crossed the blood brain barrier
(BBB) or remained within blood vessels in the brain. Further, these studies did not report the
presence of Aβ accumulation or significant differences in the number and distribution of
astrocytes and micgroglial cells [23]. However, Singhrao et al., [24] found diffuse punctate
staining suggesting tissue damage and appearance of age related granules in mice administered
Pg. Ishida et al., [25] utilized middle age (69 weeks of age at sample collection) Amyloid Pre-
cursor Protein transgenic (APP-Tg) mice, and determined the effect of oral application of Pg
on Aβ accumulation. The results showed Aβ accumulation in both experimental and control
APP-Tg mice, but significantly more in experimental mice. However, translocation of Pg as
well as pathologies such as neurodegeneration, microgliosis and astrogliosis were not investi-
gated. A recent study by Liu [26] demonstrated microgliosis when live Pg was directly injected
into the brain but other pathologies related to AD in vivo were not reported.
Taken together, in ApoE-/- mice and humans with AD, Pg or its products appear to translo-
cate from the mouth to the brain but this, to date, has not been convincingly demonstrated.
More importantly, it has not been shown if oral application of a periodontal pathogen leads to
neural pathology that is pathognomonic of AD in normal WT mice, as WT mice are not
thought to cleave APP in the amyloidogenic pathway in measureable levels [27].
There is increasing evidence that certain bacterial and viral infections underlie increased
risk for development of AD in humans [28,29]. Thus, it is cogent and timely to hypothesize
that repeated chronic exposure of a periodontal pathogen can result in neuropathology includ-
ing extracellular Aβ42 and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) production which are hallmarks of
AD in humans.

 To test this hypothesis, we subjected 8-week old C57BL/6 WT mice to experimental chronic
periodontitis by repeated oral application of the periodontal pathogen, Pg, for 22 weeks [20]
and examined the hippocampi of mice administered Pg (experimental group) or vehicle alone
(control group) for the development of neuropathology. As mentioned, we documented that
these mice developed periodontitis as assessed by loss of tooth supporting bone. In this study,
we focused on the hippocampus since it is one of the primary areas in the brain that exhibits
neurodegeneration in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD [30,31].
Materials and methods
Animals
This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Illinois at
Chicago (Protocol approval #15–142). Twenty 6-week old male C57BL/6 mice were purchased
from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and acclimatized for one week. Mice were main-
tained on regular chow (7912 Teklad LM-485, Envigo RMS, Indianapolis, IN) and water ad
libitum at a constant temperature (22˚C) with humidity of 45% to 55% in a 12-hour light/dark
cycle.
Bacterial culture and preparation
Pg (strain W83) was grown anaerobically as described in our previous study [20]. Cell density
was determined by spectrophotometry at an optical density of 550 nm based on a standard
curve established using colony forming units (CFU). 1x109 Pg were transferred to microfuge
tubes and vortexed briefly and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 2 minutes at 4˚C. Supernatants were
discarded and the pellets were re-suspended in 4 oC PBS, and then re-pelleted by centrifuga-
tion. Supernatants were removed, and bacteria re-suspended in 100 μl of 2% carboxymethyl
cellulose (CMC) in PBS and tubes immediately placed on ice until administered to mice as
described [20].
Study design
Mice were divided into 2 groups (N = 10/group): 100 μl of Pg in CMC containing 109 Pg
(experimental group) or CMC alone (vehicle alone control group) was applied (2 applications
of 50 μl) in the oral cavity on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays of every week for 22 weeks.
Mice that received oral applications of Pg were kept in a separate room (Biohazard Room)
from control mice to avoid cross contamination. All mice were weighed once a week for the
duration of the experiment and food consumption was measured twice a week. Mice were sac-
rificed using isoflurane anesthesia followed by cervical dislocation and decapitation at the 23rd
week and the brains were removed quickly with one hemisphere fixed in paraformaldehyde to
be embedded in paraffin (formalin fixed paraffin embedded, FFPE samples) for immunofluo-
rescence/histochemical analyses and the other half snap frozen and used for metabolomics
analysis. The results of this metabolomic study have been published [20].
Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, and
immunohistochemistry
Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed for the detection of Aβ42, intact neurons
(NeuN), microglia (Iba1), astrocytes (GFAP), degrading neurons (Fluoro Jade C, FJC), proin-
flammatory cytokines (IL1β, TNFα, and IL6), nuclei (DAPI) and Pg/gingipain. Briefly,

 sections were first de-paraffinized with xylene and rehydrated through a series of decreasing
percentages of ethanol. Antigen retrieval was performed by microwaving sections in 1 mM
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), pH 8.0 or in 10 mM citrate buffer pH 6.0 for 5 min
repeated 4 times. Cell and nuclear membrane permeablization was performed by incubating
sections in 0.25% Tween 20 in PBS for 30 min.
Tissue sections were then independently incubated with 1) mouse monoclonal antibody to
Aβ42 (57001,QED Bioscience, San Diego, CA) and rabbit monoclonal antibody to Aβ42 (H31L21)
(700254, Thermo Fisher Scientific) both at a 1:100 dilution, 2) mouse monoclonal antibody to
NeuN (AB 104224, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and rabbit monoclonal antibody to NeuN
(AB177487, Abcam) at a 1:100 dilution to detect intact neurons, 3) goat antibody to Iba1 (NB100,
Novus Biologicals, LLC, Littleton, CO) to detect microglia, and 4) mouse monoclonal antibody to
anti-GFAP (3670, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. Danvers, MA) to detect astrocytes at a 1:100
dilution overnight at 4˚C. Pg/gingipain was detected using mouse monoclonal antibody 61BG1.3
(DSHB, Iowa City, IA, USA) at a 1:100 dilution as well as rabbit polyclonal antibody to the active
site of gingipains [32] at a 1:100 dilution. To detect cytokines of interest, sections were incubated
with rabbit anti-IL1β polyclonal antibody (ab9722, Abcam) at a 1:100 dilution, rabbit anti-TNFα
(ab66579, Abcam) at a 1:100 dilution, or rabbit anti-IL6 (ab6672, Abcam) at a 1:100 dilution for
10 min at room temperature and then overnight at 4 oC. Appropriate secondary antibodies (either
donkey anti-mouse antibody conjugated with Alexa Flour 647 (A31571, Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA), donkey anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594 (A21207, Thermo
Fisher Scientific) or donkey anti-goat antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (A11055,
Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used. To address the possibility that anti-mouse secondary anti-
body might yield false positive signals because of the possible presence of mouse IgG in tissue
samples, we repeated immunostaining using sections from ten control and nine experimental
mice each using 1:100 dilutions of rabbit monoclonal antibody to Aβ42 (H31L21) (700254,
Thermo Fisher Scientific) and rabbit monoclonal antibody to NeuN (AB177487, Abcam) followed
by donkey anti-rabbit conjugated with Alexa fluor 594 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For microglia,
we also used goat anti-Iba1 antibody (NB100, Novus Biologicals, LLC) followed by donkey anti-
goat antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a1:800 dilution as sec-
ondary antibody. Isotypic (negative) controls were used to determine non-specific binding of anti-
bodies for all experiments. Nuclei were stained with DAPI as described [14].
Cytokine positive staining cells were counted in five randomly selected fields within a
defined area in the hippocampus as visualized by IF and the mean number and standard devia-
tion (SD) of cytokine positive cells per field was tabulated per group. For NeuN positive cell
counts, a rectangle (50μm x 100μm) was selected from the same position in CA1 and DG
regions from control and experimental groups and the number of NeuN+ cells were counted
in the defined rectangular areas. Scoring for all determinations was done by an investigator
who was blinded to the sample group.
FJC staining to detect degrading neurons was performed according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (Fluoro-Jade C staining Kit, Biosensis, Thebarton, South Australia) and stained sec-
tions were imaged by IF microscopy. FJC positive cells were counted in five rectangular fields
(220μm x 75μm) by an investigator blinded to the sample group.
The number of Aβ42 positive plaque signals were counted in one rectangular area (1.8mm x
1.3mm), which encompasses the entire right hemisphere of the hippocampus, from experimental
and control groups (N = 10 for control and N = 9 experimental groups) using two different antibod-
ies for validation. The number of astrocytes (GFAP) and microglia (Iba1) were counted in a rectan-
gular area of 990μm x 680μm and 220μm x 160μm respectively in 5 fields/sample, respectively.
Phospho-Tau (Ser396) was detected using a mouse monoclonal antibody (SC32275, Santa
Cruz biotechnology, Inc. Dallas, Tx) as primary antibody followed by peroxidase/avidin-biotin

 complex/DAB staining according to the manufacturer’s instructions (PK 6102, Vector Labora-
tories, Burlingame, CA).
Quantitative detection of 16S rRNA genes from Pg
Genomic DNA was extracted from tissue samples preserved in FFPE using a Maxwell1 RSC
device and the Maxwell DNA FFPE kit (AS1450, Promega Corporation, Madison, WI) accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s instructions. Primers and probes targeting Pg 16S rRNA genes were
synthesized as described previously [33]. The sequences of the Pg 16S rRNA gene primers in
5’-3’ orientation were: GCGCTCAACGTTCAGCC(forward primer; position 612 to 628 accord-
ing to the 16S rRNA gene of P. gingivalis W83), CACGAATTCCGCCTGC(reverse primer; posi-
tion 664 to 679), and CACTGAACTCAAGCCCGGCAGTTTCAA(probe; position 634 to 660).
PCR primers and TaqMan probe for detection of Pg were custom made by Integrated DNA
Technologies (IDT, Coralville, IA) with a 6-FAM fluorescent label and both Zen internal and
3’ Iowa Black fluorescence quenchers. A synthetic double-stranded DNA standard for 16S
rRNA gene was synthesized as a gBLOCK fragment (IDT, San Jose, CA). The standard con-
tained 243 bp of the16S rRNA gene from Pg strain W83, and greater than 60 bp of adjacent
DNA on either side of the target sites. The double-stranded gBLOCK oligonucleotide was
diluted across 8 orders of magnitude, and used as a standard for quantitation of Pg 16S rRNA
genes in genomic DNA extracts. PCR amplification was performed in a total reaction mixture
volume of 25 μl. The reaction mixtures contained 12.5 μl of 2x TaqMan universal PCR master
mix (4304437, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 300 nM each P. gingivalis-specific primer, 100 nM
Pg-specific probe, and 5 μl of purified DNA from FFPE samples. The samples were subjected
to an initial amplification cycle of 50˚C for 2 min and 95˚C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at
95˚C for 15 s and 60˚C for 1 min.
Real time RT-PCR for detection of APP, BACE1, NeuN (rbFox3), PSEN1,
ADAM10 and proinflammatory cytokines IL1β, IL6 and TNFα
RNA from FFPE sample sections was isolated using an automated RNA purification instru-
ment (Promega Maxwell RSC) and a Maxwell RSC FFPE RNA kit (AS1440, Promega Corpora-
tion, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Complementary DNA
(cDNA) was prepared using a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (4368814,
Thermo Fisher Scientific) in accordance with the manufacturer’s manual.
Real time RT-PCR primers and probes were purchased: wild type APP (Mm01344172_m1,
Thermo Fisher Scientific, wild type BACE1 (Mm00478664_m1, Thermo Fisher Scientific),
RbFOx3 (Mm0124771_m1, Thermo Fisher Scientific), wild type PSEN1(Mm00501184_m1,
Thermo Fisher Scientific) and ADAM10 (Mm005457422_m1, thermos Fisher Scientific), IL1β
(Mm01336189m1, Thermo Fisher Scientific), IL6 (Mm00446190m1, Thermo Fisher Scien-
tific), TNFα (Mm99999068m1, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and mouse β-actin as endogenous
control (4452339E, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Duplex RT-PCR was performed with one
primer pair amplifying the gene of interest and the other an internal reference (β-actin) in the
same tube. Thermocycler parameters were 50˚C for 2 min, 95˚C for 10 min, and then 40 cycles
at 95˚C for 15 sec and 60˚C for 1 min. Each sample was run in duplicate and the mean value of
each set of duplicates was normalized to mouse β-actin and used to calculate relative gene
expression by the ΔΔCT method.
Statistical analysis
Nonparametric data were evaluated by the Mann-Whitney U-test for two-group comparisons.
p<0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analyses.

 Results
The total number of experimental mice was N = 10 for control and N = 9 for the experimental
group because one experimental mouse was sacrificed at week 22.
Pg/gingipain was detected intra-nuclearly, peri-nuclearly, and extra-
cellularly in the hippocampus of animals following oral application of Pg
Pg/gingipain was detected by IF microscopy in the hippocampus of all samples from the experi-
mental group (N = 9) but none from the control group (N = 10) (Fig 1A, 1B and 1C). We also
determined the presence of Pg genomic DNA in DNA isolated from FFPE samples using qPCR
from 5 mice from each group. The results confirmed the presence of Pg specific genomic DNA
(16S rRNA gene) in experimental but not control mice (Fig 1D). Pg/gingipain staining visual-
ized by IF was localized either intra-nuclearly, peri-nuclearly or extra-cellularly (Fig 1B).
Nuclear localization of Pg/gingipain was confirmed by 3-D images compiled from z-sec-
tions by confocal microscopy (Fig 2A) and orthogonal analysis (Fig 2B).
We further used a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the active site His sequence of
gingipain [32]. Perinuclear and intranuclear Pg/gingipain were detected confirming the results
from experiments using the mouse monoclonal antibody 61BG1.3 (S1 Fig).
IF microscopy was used to determine the cell types in which intracellular Pg/gingipain was
present using antibodies to GFAP, Iba1 and NeuN (Fig 3). Astrocytes, microglia and NeuN+
cells all exhibited intracellular Pg/gingipain staining (Fig 3).
Inflammation was observed in the hippocampus of mice after oral
application of Pg
Since the hippocampus is an area of the brain that exhibits neurodegeneration in patients with
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD [30,31], we examined the hippocampus of experi-
mental and control mice for inflammation by assessing the expression of the proinflammatory
cytokines IL6, IL1β and TNFα by RT-PCR and IF microscopy. Experimental mice had a

 significantly higher expression of all three cytokines compared with controls (Fig 4). Samples
probed with isotypic control antibodies were all negative.
Intact neuronal cells (NeuN+ cells) were fewer and the gene expression of
rbFox3 (NeuN) in the hippocampus was less in experimental mice
compared with controls
As inflammation is known to damage neurons [34], we next determined neuronal integrity
using NeuN antibody which detects intact neurons. To ascertain that similar sections of the
hippocampus were compared between control and experimental samples, sections with a simi-
lar blade lengths of Dentate Gyrus (DG) were selected for immunostaining. NeuN positive
cells were densely packed in the DG and CA1 regions of the hippocampus in the control group
(Fig 5A) but not in the experimental group (Fig 5B). The difference between the number of
NeuN positive cells between control and experimental group was statistically significant in
both DG and CA1 regions (Fig 5C). Isotype controls were all negative.
To further confirm that NeuN positivity is decreased in the experimental group compared
with controls, we used RNA isolated from FFPE samples and performed RT-PCR for expres-
sion of the NeuN gene, rbFOX3. The result showed significantly downregulated rbFOX3 gene
expression in the experimental group compared with controls (Fig 5D).
Number of degenerating neurons was significantly greater in the
experimental group compared with controls
To determine if the fewer neurons in the experimental group was due to neurodegeneration,
we stained hippocampus sections with Fluoro Jade C (FJC) which detects degenerating

 neurons. As evidenced in Fig 6, there were no cells staining with FJC in the control group (Fig
6A). In contrast, numerous cells in DG and CA1 regions stained positive with FJC (Fig 6B)
indicating neurodegeneration in these areas in experimental animals (Fig 6B). The difference
between groups was statistically significant (p<0.0001, Fig 6C).
APP and BACE1 gene expression was significantly higher in the brains of
experimental group compared with control group whereas ADAM10
expression was significantly decreased in experimental group. There was no
statistically significant difference in PSEN1 gene expression between groups
Since inflammation is known to increase APP levels [35,36], we next determined gene expres-
sion of APP and BACE1 by RT-PCR using RNA isolated from FFPE samples. As expected,
APP and BACE1 gene expression was significantly higher in experimental compared with con-
trol animals (p<0.05, Fig 7). We further determined ADAM10 and PSEN1 gene expression.

 Aβ42 was detected in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of experimental
mice but not in controls
It has been reported that elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines increase the production
of Aβ42 via increased levels of BACE [37]. Thus we determined the expression of Aβ42 in the
hippocampus and cortex of experimental and control mice. Although APP in WT mice is not
thought to be cleaved in the amyloidogenic pathway in measurable quantities, our young adult
experimental mice (31 weeks old at sacrifice) exhibited a significant amount of extracellular
Aβ42 accumulation whereas control mice had none (Fig 8).
We further used a rabbit monoclonal antibody against Aβ42 and obtained the same result
for control (N = 10) and for experimental group (N = 9), thus confirming that the Aβ42 positiv-
ity was not the result of antibody cross-reacting with mouse IgG (S2 Fig).
Intracellular Aβ42 was evident in some astrocytes
Astrocytes are thought to be involved in the clearance of Aβ from the brain parenchyma to the
perivascular space [38]. In addition to extracellular amyloid plaque formation, intracellular
Aβ42 was detected in astrocytes in experimental but not in control mice (Fig 9).
Phospho-Tau (Ser396) protein was detected in the experimental but not in
the control mice
Since the oral application of Pg results in extracellular Aβ42 accumulation in the hippocampus,
we next determined the presence of p-Tau (Ser396) which is known to be phosphorylated in
the early stage of AD [39]. Immunohistochemistry results show that NFTs were present in the

 hippocampus of the experimental but not control mice (Fig 10). Silver staining was also used
to confirm the presence of NFTs (S3 Fig).
An increased number of microglial cells (microgliosis) was present in the
hippocampus of experimental mice compared with control mice
Microglia are resident macrophage-like cells in the CNS that monitor the microenvironment
by responding to and phagocytosing cell debris [40]. In response to microbial infection or neu-
ronal damage, microglia are over-activated and release proinflammatory cytokines. The num-
ber of activated microglia was significantly higher in experimental group compared with the
control group in our model system (Fig 11).
An increased number of Astrocytes (Astrogliosis) was evident in the
hippocampus of experimental mice compared with control mice
Astrocytes are known to function in biochemical support of endothelial cells that form the
blood brain barrier (BBB) and also provide nutrients such as lactate to neurons. The increased

 number of astrocytes (astrogliosis) can be induced by infection [41]. Importantly, astrocytes
have also been shown to function in Aβ clearance [42,43]. Thus, we examined expression of
astrocytes in association with Aβ42. There was a significantly higher number of astrocytes in
both CA1 and DG regions of the hippocampus of experimental mice compared with controls
(Fig 12A–12C). Furthermore, there were astrocytes in association with Aβ42 in the experimen-
tal group (Fig 12B).
The presence of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration,
together with extracellular deposits of Aβ42 are considered hallmarks of AD [44]. Thus, the
results from this study show that chronic oral application of Pg in WT C57BL/6 mice results in
neuropathology that is characteristic of AD.
Discussion
The two major forms of AD are familial (early onset) AD which constitutes less than 5% of AD
cases and sporadic (late onset) AD which constitutes over 95% of AD cases [45]. Early onset
AD results primarily from mutation of genes such as APP and presenilin-1, 2 which results in
overexpression of APP and resultant accumulation of Aβ. Sporadic AD has a relatively late
onset (60–65 years of age) but its etiology and molecular mechanisms are largely unknown,
although ApoE4 and microbial infection are known to be strong risk factors. For example,
infection of Herpes simplex virus-1(HSV-1), Chlamydia pneumoniae, and spirochetes such as
Borrelia burgdorferi and Treponema have been implicated and/or associated with sporadic AD
[21,46,47,48], culminating with the development of amyloid plaque and/or tangles [47,49,
50,51]. In analysis of 6 Treponema species, bacteria from the genus Treponema, including the
periodontal pathogens T. socranskii and T. denticola, were detected significantly more fre-
quently in AD patient brain samples (14 of 16), when compared to healthy control brain

 samples (4 of 18) [21]. Other spirochetes, most notably Borrelia burgdorferi, have been
involved in the possible etiology of AD as first suggested by Miklossy [52] and in a more recent
compended analysis of brain and blood samples from 495 samples from AD patients, 91%
were positive for spirochetes as compared to 0% for 185 controls [28]. Thus, these data strongly
suggest that spirochetes are involved in the development of AD in humans, but other classes of
organisms are implicated as well. Recently, the abundance of bacteria population in the post-
mortem brains of AD and non-AD (cognitively unimpaired) subjects were compared using
16S ribosomal gene-specific next generation sequencing [53]. The results showed increased
bacterial populations in AD brains compared with non-AD brains.
A number of animal models have been developed to understand the mechanisms underly-
ing the development of familial AD. Most of these model systems use mice that are transgenic
with multiple insertion of human APP genes, mutated human APP genes, or presenelin genes
(first generation transgenic mouse models) or with insertion of humanized sequences that rep-
resent known mutations into endogenous mouse APP genes (second generation transgenic
mouse model) (see [54] for review). In contrast, in spite of the high prevalence, few models
have been established to study sporadic AD with the exception of the ApoE-Tg mouse model.
We believe that a chronic model system of AD using repeated exposure of WT mice to bacte-
ria/products is of particular value given the aforementioned relevance of the organisms

 implicated in possible induction of AD. Chronic prolonged exposure to risk factors may be
necessary for the development of AD since it takes more than two decades for amyloidosis to
induce cortical tauopathy and neurodegeneration in humans [55]. Furthermore, the use of
WT mice is of value since a human gene inserted in a mouse background may not be regulated
as in humans and the response in transgenic mice to Aβ may be distinct from that in humans.
It is of interest to note that results from a recent study [56] demonstrated infection-induced
Aβ formation around bacteria in two days following the injection of viable Salmonella typhy-
murium into the brains of genetically modified mice (5XFAD). This study suggests an anti-
microbial function of Aβ, and thus Aβ formation may be a physiological response to inflam-
mation in the brain or direct response to invading micro-organisms. However, whether these
responses are dependent on the type of host, i.e., transgenic or WT mouse, is not known. It is
commonly believed that formation of Aβ in WT mice is thought not to occur at a detectable
level. Furthermore, there are few studies which have investigated the development of Aβ using

 WT mice [51]. Thus, the formation of Aβ and host interaction to Aβ in normal WT mice is
still not clear. Therefore, we used C57BL/6 WT mice and determined if chronic oral infection
with periodontal pathogen is an initiating factor for the development of neuropathology con-
sistent with that in human AD.
A major finding from our study is that extracellular Aβ42 plaques were detected using two
different primary antibodies in all C57BL WT mice following chronic oral application of Pg
but not in control mice. These mice were 31 weeks of age at sacrifice; this age is considered
young adult, since the median lifespan of C57BL is 866 days (123 weeks) [57]. As mentioned,
detection of Aβ42 in our C57BL/6 non-transgenic WT mice administered oral Pg was unex-
pected since APP is thought not to be cleaved in the amyloidogenic pathway in measurable
quantities in WT non-transgenic mice. The increased Aβ42 in our WT mice in response to oral
application of Pg was accompanied by an increase in local production of proinflammtory cyto-
kine expression in the brain as assessed by RT-PCR and IF microscopy. We do not have data
on systemic cytokine levels in these mice but we have shown previously [58] that experimetal
periodontitis is associated with increased inflammation in the liver due to translocation of a
bacterial poduct in the absence of significantly increased levels of circulating proinflammatory
cytokines. It is known that increased inflammation stimulates APP production [35] as well as
increased levels/activity of β and ɣ secretases [59,60], resulting in Aβ42 production. In our
study, we detected increased APP and BACE1 gene expression in the experimental compared
with control mice, suggesting that the greater Aβ42 production reflects cleavage of APP by
increased levels of BACE1. However, it is also possible that degradation/clearance of Aβ may
be impaired in our mice since Aβ accumulation in AD can result from decreased degradation/

 clearance of Aβ [61]. Alternatively, it has been shown that gingipain cleaves caspase 3 [62] and
caspase 3 activates gamma secretase activating protein (GSAP) [63], and thus hypothetically
gingipain can indirectly activate ɣ-secretase. The resultant Aβ42 can activate BACE1 and pro-
duce more Aβ42 in a positive feedback loop [64].
A few previous studies have investigated the effects of Pg or Pg-LPS on the brain. Wu et al.,
[65] simulated the effect of bacteremia in the brain by performing intraperitoneal injection of
Pg-LPS (1 μg/g BW) every day for 5 weeks. The results indicated intracellular (but not extracel-
lular) Aβ42 localized in lysosomes in cells in CA1 regions in middle-aged (53 week old) WT
non-transgenic C57 mice, but not in cathepsinB -/- mice. The results from this study suggest
that Pg-LPS increased the expression of cathepsin B in microglia and neurons of middle aged
mice, resulting in increased intracellular Aβ expression [65]. The effect of orally applied Pg
was also investigated using the AD transgenic mouse model, APP-Tg [25]. Immuno-histo-
chemistry performed 5 weeks following one oral administration of Pg showed accumulation of
Aβ in the hippocampus and cortex in both the experimental and control APP-Tg mice (69
weeks of age) with statistically higher plaque loads in experimental mice. In addition, TNFα
and IL1β in brain homogenates were statistically higher in the experimental compared with
control groups. In the same study, the effect of Pg oral application was examined 5 weeks fol-
lowing a single oral application of Pg in C57BL WT mice. Surprisingly, Aβ was present in
these 69 week old WT C57BL mice with and without Pg application, with no difference in the
levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in cortex homogenates between groups. These data suggest that a single
dose of Pg application is not sufficient to induce Aβ production, but older WT mice do

 produce Aβ as a function of age. Aβ was not evident in the 31 week old C57 WT control mice
in our study. A longitudinal study monitoring Aβ formation and deposition in response to
oral application of Pg over time as well as the effect(s) of bacteria/products load on Aβ forma-
tion has yet to be performed. In addition, a study of the development of behavioral changes in
conjunction with Aβ formation has yet to be done in these mice.
Our results show locally increased IL1β, IL6 and TNFα gene expression in the brain as
detected by RT-qPCR. Since, we did not measure systemic inflammatory cytokines, we can’t
rule out the possibility of a contribution from systemic inflammation to the development of
Aβ42.
To detect gingipain, we utilized a mouse monoclonal antibody (61BG1.3) as well as rabbit
polyclonal antibody which are specific to an epitope in the beta-adhesin domain of gingipain
(G907-T931) and to the active site His sequence of gingipain, respectively. Gingipains are cys-
teine proteinases, designated RgpA, RgpB and Kgp which are associated with the outer cell
membrane and membrane vesicles of Pg [66,67,68]. Thus, using this antibody, we cannot
determine if the observed signals detected by IF are from intact bacteria or gingipain. How-
ever, the presence of Pg genomic DNA in the brain of experimental mice and the intracellular
localization of Pg/gingipain in astrocytes, microglia, and neurons, but not in control mice,
indicates that Pg DNA and possibly intact live Pg is translocated across a compromised blood
brain barrier (BBB). Further studies are necessary to determine if live, dormant, or dead peri-
odontal bacteria are present in the brain.
We detected Pg/gingipain in microglia, astrocytes and neurons including intra-nuclear- or
peri-nuclear locations in these cells using IF and confocal microscopy. This was confirmed in
Z-sections and by orthogonal analysis. Pg is known to invade host cells such as epithelial cells
[69] and endothelial cells [70], and a heterodimer derived from an RgpA of Pg designated as
HRgpA can enter the nucleus of epithelial cells and also localize in and around the nucleus in
vitro [69]. Thus, it is possible that intranuclear and perinuclear signals were from gingipain
HRgpA. In cultured epithelial cells, HRgpA is known to double mitotic activity; this finding
combined with the presence of apoptotic cells, may suggest that HRgpA influences cell cycle
control mechanisms [68].
In summary, we present data obtained by IF, immunohistochemistry, confocal microscopy
and qPCR to support the hypothesis that chronic oral application of Pg results in neuroinflam-
mation, neurodegeneration, and intra and extracellular Aβ42 plaque formation with increased
APP, BACE1 add reduced ADAM10 gene expression, reduced NeuN gene expression and
NFT production in non-transgenic C57BL/6 WT mice. Whether this neuropathology is
directly caused by translocated Pg/gingipain in the brain or is a consequence of other factors
triggered by oral application of Pg (e.g., gut dysbiosis) is not clear and needs to be determined
in future studies. The importance of our study is the demonstration that young adult WT mice
(31 weeks old) develop neuropathology, including the accumulation of Aβ42, following chronic
oral application of the periodontal pathogen.
Lastly, females appear to be more vulnerable to AD than males [71,72,73] thus future stud-
ies should examine the effect of Pg/gingipain in female mice also.
Conclusions
Our results strongly suggest that chronic oral infection of Pg can be an initiator of the develop-
ment of neuropathology that is consistent with that characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease in
humans. Whether this phenomenon is due to direct invasion of Pg/gingipain into neurons,
astrocytes, and microglial cells or an indirect effect via other changes that occur by oral appli-
cation of Pg, such as gut dysbiosis and/or systemic inflammation, needs to be determined.

 Finally, this is the first demonstration that young adult WT mice became amyloidogenic fol-
lowing low grade oral bacterial infection.
AD is the most common cause of senile dementia which affects both males and females. At
present, there is no effective treatment or cure and there is no consensus on an etiology of AD.
Understanding causality and risk factors for the development of AD is critical to the develop-
ment of intervention strategies and also treatment for this disease. Investigation of causality
for the development of AD using WT mice with chronic infection may shed light into the etiol-
ogy of sporadic AD and into future therapeutic strategies.
