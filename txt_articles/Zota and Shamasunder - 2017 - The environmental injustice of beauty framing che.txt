Abstract
The ObGyn community has issued a call to action to prevent toxic environmental chemical 
exposures and their threats to healthy human reproduction. Recent committee opinions recognize 
that vulnerable and underserved women may be disproportionately impacted by environmental 
chemical exposures and recommend that reproductive health professionals champion policies that 
secure environmental justice. Beauty product use is an understudied source of environmental 
chemical exposures. Beauty products can include reproductive and developmental toxicants such 
as phthalates and heavy metals; however, disclosure requirements are limited and inconsistent. 
Compared to White women, women of color have higher levels of beauty product-related 
environmental chemicals in their bodies, independent of socioeconomic status. Even small 
exposures to toxic chemicals during critical periods of development, such as pregnancy, can trigger 
adverse health consequences such as impacts on fertility and pregnancy, neurodevelopment, and 
cancer. In this commentary, we seek to highlight the connections between environmental justice 
and beauty product-related chemical exposures. We describe racial/ethnic differences in beauty 
product use such as skin lighteners, hair straighteners, and feminine hygiene products as well as 
the potential chemical exposures and health risks associated with these products. We also discuss 
how targeted advertising can take advantage of mainstream beauty norms to influence use of these 
products. Reproductive health professionals can use this information to advance environmental 
justice by being prepared to counsel patients who have questions about toxic environmental 
exposures from beauty care products and other sources. Researchers and health care providers can 
also promote health-protective policies such as improved ingredient testing and disclosure for the 
beauty product industry. Future clinical and public health research should consider beauty product 
use as a factor that may shape health inequities in women’s reproductive health across the life 
course.

Introduction
The American Congress of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) committee opinion1 
emphasizes that toxic environmental chemicals are a threat to human reproduction and there 
may be differential vulnerability by life stage or social position. More recently, doctors 
around the world echoed these concerns through the International Federation for Obstetrics 
and Gynecology (FIGO) committee opinion. FIGO recommended that reproductive health 
professionals recognize disproportionate burdens to toxic chemical exposures in certain 
patient populations and champion policies that secure environmental justice.2 Environmental 
justice integrates concepts of environmental racism and inequality and is defined as the 
unequal distribution of environmental benefits and pollution burdens based on race.3 An 
understanding of how both social and environmental factors may jointly influence health is 
necessary for the elimination of health disparities.4 The Environmental Protection Agency 
definition, adopted by FIGO, elaborates on this principle for regulatory purposes and defines 
environmental justice as “the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people 
regardless of race, color, national origin, or income”.2, 5
Beauty product use is an understudied source of environmental chemical exposures and may 
be one avenue for health professionals to intervene among vulnerable populations such as 
women of color. Consumer products, and personal care products specifically, are a source of 
exposure to toxic chemicals for all women.6–8 Beauty products (one category of personal 
care products) have limited and inconsistent disclosure of chemical ingredients and most 
lack adequate data on health and safety.6, 9
Racial/ethnic differences in beauty product use are documented across multiple categories 
including skin care, hair care, and feminine hygiene (Table 1). However, evidence points to 
the limits of examining these exposures in isolation. Rather, we argue that health 
practitioners should consider an “environmental injustice of beauty” approach, which 
incorporates the social factors that influence beauty product use and the potential for 
cumulative impacts that may arise due to co-occurring environmental exposures. This 
approach provides a more comprehensive picture of how environmental factors may shape 
reproductive health disparities.
Pre-existing vulnerabilities and cumulative impacts
Beauty products contain multiple chemicals that can adversely impact health, such as 
formaldehyde, phthalates, parabens, lead, mercury, triclosan, and benzophenone.6, 9, 10 
Exposure to one or more of these chemicals has been linked to endocrine disruption, cancer, 
reproductive harm and impaired neurodevelopment in children.11–14 Women ages 18 to 34 
are more likely to be “heavy buyers”, purchasing more than ten types of products a year.15 
These women and their offspring may experience heightened vulnerability to toxic

 environmental chemicals if products are used during sensitive periods of development such 
as preconception or pregnancy.2 Low-income and racial/ethnic minority groups may be 
further susceptible since they are more frequently exposed to multiple environmental and 
social risk factors and face poorer health outcomes.16 Nationally representative data of US 
reproductive-aged women suggest that women of color have higher levels of certain 
endocrine-disrupting chemicals, such as phthalates and parabens, in their bodies compared 
to White women, and these racial/ethnic differences are not explained by socioeconomic 
status.17–20 Workers in the beauty industry, who are predominantly women of color and 
immigrant women, can also face occupational health hazards from chemicals in professional 
cosmetic products and ad-hoc workplace safety standards.21–23 Cumulative assessments of 
environmental risk factors among socially marginalized groups have historically prioritized 
place-based pollution sources, such as polluting industries or high traffic density,24, 25 
however, beauty product exposures may be elevated in some of the same communities that 
encounter disproportionate exposures to place-based pollution.26, 27
Social and economic dimensions of product use
The beauty product industry is estimated at $400 billion globally.28 According to market 
analyses and consumer profiles, multicultural beauty products have outpaced the overall 
cosmetics market.29 Black consumers purchase nine times more ethnic hair and beauty 
products than other groups,30, 31 and disproportionately purchase hair relaxers and 
straighteners. Latinos are the fastest growing ethnic beauty market segment32 and Asian 
Americans spend 70% more than the national average on skin care products.33
Mass distribution of images that idealize Whiteness can influence sales of hair straighteners, 
skin lighteners, and odor masking products.34, 35 Racial discrimination based on European 
beauty norms can lead to internalized racism, body shame, and skin tone dissatisfaction, 
factors that can influence product use to achieve straighter hair or lighter skin. Thus, beauty 
product use may be one way that structural discrimination becomes biologically 
embedded.36, 37
Targeted racial/ethnic marketing can influence product use and related health inequities by 
taking advantage of mainstream beauty norms.38, 39 In a well-described example of the 
influences of marketing practices on health disparities, highly targeted menthol cigarette 
marketing in low-income inner city African-American neighborhoods38, 39 created a 
racialized geography of tobacco-related health disparities.40
Below, we document evidence of demographic differences in product use and chemical 
exposures in the beauty industry. We then describe how external factors, such as targeted 
advertising, can influence product use.
Skin-lightening face creams
Women in Africa, India, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and the Americas regularly use 
skin-lightening cosmetics.41, 42 Skin-lightening creams can contain hydroquinone, topical 
corticosteroids, or inorganic mercury.43 Multiple cases of mercury poisoning, characterized 
by damage to the kidneys and the central nervous system, have been reported following use

 of skin-lightening products.44 The US Food and Drug Administration set a maximum 
allowable level of 1 ppm of mercury in skin products.45 However, skin products with 
mercury continue to be unregulated and available outside of the US, and these products are 
still used by certain populations in the US, including Dominican and Mexican American 
women.45–47 In a population-based study of New York City residents, those with the highest 
urine mercury levels were foreign-born Dominican women of reproductive age, and skin-
lightening creams were identified as a source of exposure among highly-exposed 
populations.45 Similarly, a medical case study reported that a pregnant Mexican American 
woman’s elevated blood mercury level of 15 μg/L (nearly 3 times the CDC early reporting 
threshold) was linked to face creams that contained over 20,000 ppm of mercury.46
Skin-lightening creams are sold globally, marketed to darker skinned women. Scholars point 
to the success of the global skin lightening industry as evidence for the global preference for 
white/light skin42, 48 and colorism, a social hierarchy based on gradations of skin color that 
discriminates against darker skin.42 A study of 45 skin bleaching products sold in Harlem, 
New York found product marketing of skin lighteners traffics in derogatory images that 
devalue Black skin in order to sell these products.49 Lighter skin tone is an important 
predictor of higher self-esteem for Black women and is associated with higher educational 
attainment and earnings among women of color.50, 51
Hair relaxers and straighteners
Compared to White women, African American and African Caribbean women are more 
likely to use a greater number and variety of hair products52, and to have their hair 
chemically or professionally treated.31 Use of these products often begins at an early age; in 
a survey of 201 African American girls, almost half of the parents/guardians reported first 
application of chemical relaxers to their child’s hair between the ages of 4 and 8.53 Hair 
products used by Black women are more likely to contain placenta (a potential source of 
estrogen hormones)54, 55 as well as industrial chemicals such as parabens52 that affect 
estrogenic pathways.56 Premature reproductive development, such as breast budding, was 
documented in African American girls exposed to estrogen- or placenta-containing hair 
products.57 Use of ethnic hair products among African American women has been 
associated with increased risk of earlier menarche58 and uterine fibroid tumors59. It has also 
been proposed as a plausible risk factor for excess premenopausal breast cancer risk 
observed among African American women.60
Hair valuations of “good” (straighter/longer) and “bad” (tightly coiled/kinky) hair can place 
burdens on Black women to change their hair texture.61, 62 Black women suffer more hair-
related anxiety and are twice as likely than White women to experience social pressure at 
work to straighten their hair.63 For example, the US army historically banned several 
hairstyles traditionally used by African American women, such as twists and multiple 
braids, in favor of styles that encouraged straightening or other practices to change hair 
texture.64

 Feminine hygiene and other fragranced products
Black women are more likely than White women to use vaginal douches as well as other 
fragranced feminine cleansing products such as sprays and wipes.19 In a nationally 
representative sample of reproductive-aged women, those who reported frequent douching 
had 150% higher exposures to diethyl phthalate (DEP), a chemical commonly found in 
fragrances, than douche non-users.19 Differences in DEP exposures between Black and 
White women were no longer statistically significant after accounting for douching 
practices, suggesting that vaginal douching may contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in 
phthalates exposure. Prenatal exposure to DEP can alter maternal sex steroid hormone 
concentrations during pregnancy65 and may increase the risk of adverse health outcomes in 
offspring.66, 67 Vaginal douching can also increase risks of bacterial vaginosis68 and pelvic 
inflammatory disease69, and has been discouraged by ACOG.70
Use of talc powder on the genitals is another practice that is disproportionately practiced by 
US Black women.71 Talc-based body powder is a possible human carcinogen when used in 
the genital areas. A pooled analysis of epidemiologic studies found a 24% increased risk of 
ovarian cancer from genital powder use.72 These risks may be greater among Black women 
than White women.73, 74
Odor discrimination is a less described but important driver of the feminine cleansing 
practices described above. According to Ferranti75, imagined odor of African American 
women was historically used as a basis for moral judgement and an attempt to control sexual 
behavior. As a result, African American women deodorized and douched in order to be 
identified with sexual virtue. Advertisers employed targeted marketing towards Black 
women with messages that encouraged self-consciousness of potential vaginal odors. These 
habits became embedded as a cultural norm, and now persist outside of marketing efforts.75
Conclusions
ObGyn providers should be aware of the potentially toxic effects of commonly used beauty 
products, recognize disparities across these demographics, and be prepared to counsel 
patients who have questions about these and other environmental exposures. While there are 
few published clinical guidelines, emerging consortiums with published scientific consensus 
statements can provide support to clinicians.1, 76 Health professional societies can also 
promote health-protective policies, including improved ingredient testing and disclosure. 
Lastly, health scientists can collaborate in research to help address existing data gaps. 
Research on the “exposome”, or the totality of a person’s environmental exposures from 
conception to death, is a priority for the National Institutes of Environmental Health 
Sciences.77 Researchers are trying to integrate beauty products into the exposome by 
characterizing the biologic activity of beauty products using in vitro study designs56 as well 
as estimating the joint effects of chemicals and psychosocial stress on reproductive 
endpoints.78 Future research should also consider the heterogeneous social and economic 
factors that drive product use. Collectively, this multi-pronged approach can help advance 
the ACOG and FIGO recommendations to secure environmental justice and advance health 
equity.
