 INTRODUCTION
Acute sore throat is common in everyday 
practice in primary care and antibiotics are 
still frequently prescribed.1 The Cochrane 
Review of acute sore throat management2 
included 27 trials and more than 12 000 cases 
of sore throat, and found that antibiotics 
reduced the duration of pain symptoms by 
an average of 1 day. Current UK guidelines 
recommend a delayed or no prescription 
strategy for acute sore throat.3 Despite the 
guidelines and systematic review evidence 
described, most patients presenting with 
acute sore throat are prescribed immediate 
antibiotics.1,4 An alternative strategy — 
using a delayed antibiotic prescription 
— has been shown to reduce antibiotic 
uptake without any effect on recovery or 
patient satisfaction,5 and to confer a similar 
protective effect against complications 
as an immediate prescription.6 However, 
the rationale of a delayed prescription 
has been called into question because it 
results in higher antibiotic uptake than a no 
prescription strategy, with a suggestion that 
a delayed strategy is inferior to immediate 
antibiotics for some sore throat symptoms.7 
Observational studies provide useful 
evidence to complement experimental 
studies, given the concerns that randomised 
trial participants and their behaviour during 
trials (such as relating to adherence) may 
be atypical, and hence that estimates of 
effectiveness may not be applicable to 
patients consulting routinely. 
In order to describe current practice and 
outcome related to prescribing strategy in 
adults, a large observational cohort that 
had been recruited to examine potential 
prediction of septic complications of acute 
sore throat was investigated. In a subset of 
participants completing a symptom diary, 
the symptomatic outcomes and illness 
duration in relation to prescribing strategy 
were analysed.
METHOD 
Study design
This was a secondary analysis of the 
DESCARTE (Decision rule for the Symptoms 
and Complications of Acute Red Throat in 
Everyday practice) study, which as reported 
elsewhere was a large prospective cohort of 
patients presenting with acute sore throat in 
routine primary care in the UK. 6,8 A simple

Abstract
Background
A delayed or ‘just in case’ prescription has been 
identified as having potential to reduce antibiotic 
use in sore throat. 
Aim
To determine the symptomatic outcome of 
acute sore throat in adults according to antibiotic 
prescription strategy in routine care.
Design and setting
A secondary analysis of the DESCARTE 
(Decision rule for the Symptoms and 
Complications of Acute Red Throat in Everyday 
practice) prospective cohort study comprising 
adults aged ≥16 years presenting with acute 
sore throat (≤2 weeks’ duration) managed with 
treatment as usual in primary care in the UK. 
Method
A random sample of 2876 people from the full 
cohort were requested to complete a symptom 
diary. A brief clinical proforma was used to collect 
symptom severity and examination findings at 
presentation. Outcome details were collected by 
notes review and a detailed symptom diary. The 
primary outcome was poorer ‘global’ symptom 
control (defined as longer than the median 
duration or higher than median symptom 
severity). Analyses controlled for confounding by 
indication (propensity to prescribe antibiotics).
Results
A total of 1629/2876 (57%) of those requested 
returned a symptom diary, of whom 1512 
had information on prescribing strategy. The 
proportion with poorer global symptom control 
was greater in those not prescribed antibiotics 
398/587 (68%) compared with those prescribed 
immediate antibiotics 441/728 (61%) or delayed 
antibiotic prescription 116/197 59%); adjusted 
risk ratio (RR) (95% confidence intervals [CI]): 
immediate RR 0.87 (95% CI = 0.70 to 0.96), 
P = 0.006; delayed RR 0.88 (95% CI = 0.78 to 1.00), 
P = 0.042.
Conclusion
In the routine care of adults with sore throat, 
a delayed antibiotic strategy confers similar 
symptomatic benefits to immediate antibiotics 
compared with no antibiotics. If a decision is made 
to prescribe an antibiotic, a delayed antibiotic 
strategy is likely to yield similar symptomatic 
benefit to immediate antibiotics

Symptom response to antibiotic prescribing 
strategies in acute sore throat in adults:
the DESCARTE prospective cohort study in UK general practice
e634  British Journal of General Practice, September 2017
 report form (CRF) was used to document 
clinical features at presentation.  Smaller 
studies were nested in the cohort to 
develop and trial a clinical scoring method 
for bacterial infection. The nested studies 
were two consecutive diagnostic cohorts 
(n = 1107) where a clinical score to predict 
bacterial infection was developed, and a 
randomised trial (n = 1781) that compared 
the use of the clinical score and the targeted 
use of a rapid antigen detection test with 
delayed antibiotic prescribing.9 Participants 
in the trial were not included in this 
analysis because antibiotics were targeted 
according to trial criteria. Recruitment took 
place between 10 November 2006 and 1 
June 2009, from 616 recruiting practices. 
Initial recruitment was among six local 
networks (based in Southampton, Bristol, 
Birmingham, Oxford, Cardiff, and Exeter) 
but was extended nationally during the last 
18 months of recruitment. 
Patient inclusion criteria
Inclusion criteria were previously well 
patients aged ≥16 years with acute illness 
(≤14 days), presenting in primary care 
with sore throat as the main symptom, 
and with an abnormal examination of the 
pharynx (identical criteria to the authors’ 
previous studies).5 Exclusion criteria were 
severe mental health problems (such 
as cognitive impairment associated with 
being unable to consent or assess history) 
and known immune suppression. GPs 
recorded a detailed history and examination 
findings, and then treated the patient as 
usual. Antibiotic treatment was therefore 
determined by individual practitioners in 
accordance with their usual practice. 
Baseline clinical proforma
A simple clinical sheet was used to 
document age, sex, current smoking status, 
prior duration of illness, and the presence 
and severity of baseline symptoms (sore 
throat, difficulty swallowing, fever during the 
illness, runny nose, cough, feeling unwell, 
diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain, 
headache, muscle ache, sleep disturbance, 
and earache). Symptoms were recorded 
using a 4-point Likert scale (none, a slight 
problem, a moderately bad problem, or a 
severe problem), and the presence of signs 
(pus, cervical nodes, temperature, fetor, 
palatal oedema, and difficulty speaking 
because of sore throat). No laboratory tests 
were specified.
Documentation of primary outcome
A request to complete a symptom diary 
was randomly allocated to a proportion of 
those recruited to the study to achieve a 
pre-specified target of 1800 diaries. Initial 
allocation was randomly allocated to one 
in 10 participants by including the diary in 
recruitment packs. The allocation ratio was 
altered part way through the study to one 
in two packs in most centres, on account 
of observed low return rates. Allocation 
was one in four recruitment packs in 
Southampton because of the inclusion of 
an alternative questionnaire. The diary was 
similar to that used in other studies.5,10 
Patients completed the diary each 
night until symptoms resolved or for up 
to 14 nights. Each symptom was scored 
(from 0 = no problem to 6 = as bad as it 
could be): sore throat, difficulty swallowing, 
feeling unwell, fever, and sleep disturbance. 
Adverse 
symptomatic 
outcome 
was 
defined as being either above the median 
for symptom severity at day 2–4 or above 
the median duration of moderately bad 
symptoms, that is, either or both qualified 
for adverse symptomatic outcome.
Other outcomes
In order to allow comparison with other 
studies, symptom severity on day 2–4 and 
the duration of moderately bad symptoms 
(in days) were also assessed.5,10
Sample size
Sample size calculations calculated using 
nQuery for the main study were based on 
the prediction of complications — a rare 
outcome. For the proposed analysis of diary 
data, a sample of 1800 patients allowing for 
20% loss to follow-up of diaries (900 of whom 
would not be expected to have antibiotics), 
would have power to detect variables with 
prevalence between 20% to 80%, with an 
odds ratio of 2 for adverse symptomatic 
outcome among the no antibiotic group. 
How this fits in
Antimicrobial resistance is a major 
threat to public health. In the UK, 75% of 
antibiotics are prescribed in primary care, 
mainly for respiratory tract infections. 
Experimental studies suggest modest 
symptom benefit when antibiotics are 
prescribed for sore throat. In routine 
practice, antibiotics do confer modest 
symptomatic improvement on average 
and similar effects are seen with delayed 
and immediate prescribing. However, 
delayed prescribing results in reduced 
antibiotic uptake compared with immediate 
prescribing. 
British Journal of General Practice, September 2017  e635
 Analysis 
Duration of symptoms was analysed using 
Cox regression, linear regression was used 
for symptom severity, and a generalised 
linear model with a log link and binomial 
distribution was used for worsening of 
illness and adverse symptomatic outcome. 
Missing data on outcome were not imputed. 
Both the univariate statistics and the 
relationships after controlling for the severity 
of all baseline symptoms and clustering of 
patients by practice are reported. 
The Centor score, used widely to target 
treatment at those at higher risk of 
streptococcal infection, was derived in an 
emergency room setting where a score of 
≥3 predicted a 32% risk of positive culture.11 
The FeverPAIN score, which comprises 
fever in the past 24 hours, purulence, 
rapid (within 3 days) attendance, inflamed 
tonsils, and no cough or cold symptoms, 
may also be used to predict the probability 
of streptococcal infection in community 
samples and has been shown to be highly 
predictive of time to symptom resolution 
and symptom severity.12 An interaction 
between Centor/FeverPAIN and antibiotic 
prescribing strategy was tested for, which 
was to determine if those more likely to 
have streptococcal infection had evidence 
of a differential response to antibiotics. 
The scores were used to dichotomise the 
sample into those more or less likely to 
have a streptococcal infection: for Centor 
a cut-off point of ≥3 was used and for 
FeverPAIN a cut-off point of 0–2 versus ≥3 
was used. For FeverPAIN at the cut-off point 
of 0–2 the probability of a streptococcus 
swab positive result is 26%, while for those 
with a score of ≥3 it is 60%.12 For Centor the 
probability of a streptococcus swab positive 
result is 15% for those with a score of 2 and 
32% for those with a score of 3 or above.11
Analyses were carried out in Stata 
(version 12.1). To control for potential 
confounding by indication, a propensity score 
based on predictors of antibiotic prescribing 
(none versus immediate and none versus 
delayed) was calculated using a chained 
equations multiple imputation model. Results 
are presented both for complete cases 
and for models with significant predictors 
of the propensity score imputed. Outcome 
measures were not imputed because it

RESULTS
Descriptive data
In the full cohort study, 14 610 adult patients 
were recruited between 10 November 
2006 and 1 June 2009 from 616 general 
medical practices. A total of 1629/2876 (57%) 
returned a symptom diary, of whom 1512 
had information on prescribing strategy. The 
baseline characteristics of patients recruited 
and of those who maintained a symptom 
diary are shown in Appendix 1. Those given 
immediate antibiotics had more severe 
symptoms at baseline and were more likely to 
have a history of fever and severe inflammation 
or pus on tonsils.6 Those returning the diary 
were slightly older, and more likely to be 
female and a non-smoker, compared with the 
whole sample.
In those returning a diary, no antibiotics 
were prescribed for 587/1512 (39%), 
immediate antibiotics were prescribed for 
728/1512 (48%), and delayed antibiotics were 
prescribed for 197/1512 (13%). These are 
similar to the proportions prescribed to the 
full cohort: 4805/12 677 (38%), 6088/12 677 
(48%), and 1784/12 677 (14%), respectively. 
In those completing a diary, 115/197 58% of 
those given a delayed prescription reported 
using the prescription. Delayed prescribing 
was only reported by those recruited from 
approximately one half of participating 
practices 320/616 (52%).
Impact of prescribing strategies on 
symptom control
When controlling for propensity to prescribe 
antibiotics compared with no antibiotics, 
those prescribed immediate or delayed 
antibiotics experienced a reduction in poorer 
symptomatic outcomes: no antibiotics 
398/587 (68%), immediate antibiotics 
441/728 (61%), and delayed antibiotics 
116/197 (59%); adjusted risk ratio (RR) 
(95% confidence intervals [CIs]): immediate 
RR 0.87 (95% CI = 0.70 to 0.96), P = 0.006; 
delayed 0.88 (5% CI = 0.78 to 1.00), P = 0.042 
(Table 1). This finding was consistent when 
controlling for baseline severity. 
Secondary outcomes showed a reduction 
in symptom severity on days 2–4 (Table 2). 
On average, 1 day less of moderately bad 
symptoms was experienced by those 
prescribed an immediate antibiotic (no 
antibiotic: median 4 days, interquartile 
range (IQR) 2–7 days; immediate: median 
3 days, IQR 2–5 days; delayed: median 
3 days, IQR 2–6 days) (Table 3). Hazard 
ratio (HR) controlling for propensity score 
for immediate prescribing was 1.21 (95% 
CI = 1.07 to 1.38), P = 0.004, and the HR for 
delayed prescribing was 1.10 (95% CI = 0.92 
to 1.33), P = 0.30 (Table 3). The duration of 
moderately bad symptoms is illustrated in 
Figure 1.
Evidence for a differential effect of 
antibiotic prescribing among those more 
likely to have bacterial infection 
Although throat swabs were not collected, 
diary scores were used to predict the 
probability of streptococcal infection, and 
a subgroup of patients was created in 
whom bacterial infection was more likely as 
defined by a higher Centor Score (≥3) and 
FeverPAIN score (≥3).12 In this subgroup, 
the estimates of benefit were slightly 
greater than in the whole cohort for those 
given an immediate antibiotic prescription 
or delayed prescription (Tables 4 and 5). 
However, the difference between the 
subgroup and the main cohort was modest

 and statistically significant interactions 
were not powered for and were not found 
with the feverPAIN and Centor subgroups. 
The fact that those in these high-risk 
subgroups were overwhelmingly treated 
with immediate antibiotics further reduced 
the power of these analyses, particularly 
for the smaller numbers who were given 
delayed prescription. Individual secondary 
outcomes and point estimates for those at 
low/high risk of streptococcal infection are 
available from the authors on request. 
DISCUSSION
Summary
This large cohort of patients presenting 
to general practice with acute sore throat 
enabled the authors to study the effect of 
prescribing antibiotics in routine practice 
on symptom severity and speed of illness 
resolution. Compared with a no antibiotic 
strategy, a delayed antibiotic strategy 
confers similar benefits to immediate 
antibiotics with regards to effects on global 
symptom outcome. Those prescribed 
immediate antibiotics experienced both 
a reduction in symptom severity on day 
2–4 and a reduction in the duration of 
moderately bad symptoms of 1 day. Similar 
benefits were observed in those receiving 
a delayed prescription, although this study 
has limited power for some outcomes in 
this group. 
Strengths and limitations
The study was designed using a simple 
clinical proforma to minimise selection bias 
and thus to produce a large generaliseable 
prospective cohort. Patients were recruited 
at the busiest seasons for respiratory 
illness, and, as with other studies of acute 
infection,13–15 documentation of the details of 
those not approached was poor as a result 
of time pressures (because time pressure 
to recruit also meant time pressure to 
document non-recruitment). 
The large sample gathered in routine 
practice, along with the inclusion of 
diary data, enabled the study of different 
antibiotic strategies and duration of 
prescription on symptomatic outcomes and 
re-consultation, which is likely to reflect 
the real-life experience of patients. The 
prescription of antibiotics, however, is not 
at random and there is clear evidence 
of a greater propensity to prescribe for 
those with more severe symptoms at 
baseline (Appendix 1). Despite adjusting 
for propensity to prescribe and presenting 
outcomes controlled for baseline severity 
of symptoms, it is not possible to rule out 
residual confounding. 
It is possible that patients who were given 
a prescription for antibiotics subsequently 
altered their reporting of symptom severity

 having had their illness ‘validated’ by the 
doctor or the converse in those not in 
receipt of a prescription. Any study using 
self-reported diary data may be open 
to such misclassification bias but if the 
reported symptoms are accepted at face 
value then the symptoms recorded in the 
diary will reflect the patient’s experience 
of illness. In this observational dataset it 
is not known how delayed prescribing was 
operationalised, but, regardless of this, 
a delayed prescription conferred similar 
symptomatic benefits to an immediate 
prescription, with lower prescription uptake. 
Comparison with existing literature
In routine care in England, 48% of those 
presenting with an acute sore throat illness 
receive an immediate antibiotic prescription 
and 14% a delayed prescription.6 Antibiotics 
for acute sore throat are generally well 
targeted to those with the most severe 
symptoms and those most likely to 
benefit.6 In this current study, in the sample 
returning symptom diaries, 60% of those 
issued a delayed prescription reported 
using the prescription, which is greater 
than that reported in experimental studies.5 
Overall use of antibiotics is similar in the 
US (60%),16 whereas in France and the 
Netherlands reported prescribing rates are 
lower (20% and 23%, respectively), although 
these are aggregated data for all respiratory 
consultations.17 
As would be anticipated, there is some 
symptomatic benefit in those receiving 
an antibiotic comparable with that seen 
in systematic reviews and this effect is 
also seen in those in receipt of a delayed 
prescription.2,5
Although this study was not powered to 
find an interaction of the effect of antibiotic 
prescribing strategy with the likelihood of 
streptococcal infection, the point estimates 
for poorer symptomatic outcome with a no 
prescription strategy are more pronounced, 
which suggests that increased likelihood 
of streptococcal infection may make 
symptomatic benefit a little more likely 
when antibiotics are prescribed. Once 
again, there was no clear benefit from 
immediate antibiotics compared with 
delayed antibiotics in individuals more likely 
to have streptococcal infection.
Implications for research and practice
Systematic reviews have consistently 
demonstrated that antibiotics confer a 
modest benefit for symptom relief,2 and 
this study has confirmed this effect using 
evidence from routine practice. The authors 
have previously demonstrated that antibiotic 
prescriptions in routine general practice do 
appear to be targeted at those at greatest 
risk of streptococcal carriage according 
to baseline characteristics.6 Judicious use 
of antibiotics is an international priority,18 
and there is potential to reduce the uptake 
of antibiotics through greater use of the 
delayed prescription technique or through 
non-prescription. Although adoption of 
the ‘non-prescribing strategy’ results in 
the lowest uptake of antibiotics,7 use of a 
delayed prescription may be a useful option 
where current prescribing rates are high or 
there is greater concern for complications. 
It is recognised that there is a trade-off 
between lower antibiotic prescribing and 
patient satisfaction with both doctors 
and practices,19 although clinical trials 
have not demonstrated large differences 
in satisfaction between immediate and 
delayed prescribing.5 There is also likely 
a trade-off between a global reduction

 in prescribing and an increased risk of 
septic complications, although the absolute 
increase is very small.20 
Delayed prescribing in this study was 
targeted at those with intermediate 
symptom severity; however, trials of delayed 
prescribing in sore throat were not stratified 
by symptom severity and symptomatic 
outcomes were similar for all groups,5 
hence it is unlikely that more widespread 
use of the delayed strategy would result 
in worse symptomatic outcomes. Caution 
must be exercised in those with greater 
probability of streptococcal infection and, 
although adverse outcomes in those with 
higher symptom scores using a delayed 
prescription were not demonstrated in this 
study, this may be due to lack of power
. 
In one study, using a delayed strategy in 
combination with a symptom score to 
target antibiotics did result in both reduced 
antibiotic consumption and improved 
outcomes compared with empirical delayed 
prescribing, and this may be the optimal 
strategy.10 In routine practice as in trials, 
delayed prescribing offers comparable 
symptom control to immediate prescribing 
(this study), and the authors have previously 
shown it reduces re-consultation,6 and the 
risk of septic complications.8 
In the full cohort, 14% of sore throat 
consultations concluded with the issue 
of a delayed antibiotic prescription. 
However, there is potential for higher rates 
to be achieved, for instance, only half of 
participating practices in this study reported 
using the delayed strategy. GPs have been 
shown to overestimate the patient demand 
for antibiotics,21 and the use of a delayed 
strategy would be one way of countering 
this overestimation. If most of those with 
intermediate symptom severity were 
offered a delayed prescription, the total 
uptake of antibiotics would be reduced with 
no anticipated adverse effects for symptom 
control, complications, or re-consultation.
