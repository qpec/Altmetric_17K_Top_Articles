Abstract
Background: Little population-level information exists about the delivery of palliative care across multiple health sectors, important 
in providing a complete picture of current care and gaps in care.
Aim: Provide a population perspective on end-of-life palliative care delivery across health sectors.
Design: Retrospective population-level cohort study, describing palliative care in the last year of life using linked health administrative 
databases.
Setting/participants: All decedents in Ontario, Canada, from 1 April 2010 to 31 March 2012 (n 
= 
177,817).
Results: Across all health sectors, about half (51.9%) of all decedents received at least one record of palliative care in the last year of 
life. Being female, middle-aged, living in wealthier and urban neighborhoods, having cancer, and less multi-morbidity were all associated 
with higher odds of palliative care receipt. Among 92,276 decedents receiving palliative care, 84.9% received care in acute care hospitals. 
Among recipients, 35 
mean days of palliative care were delivered. About half (49.1%) of all palliative care days were delivered in the last 
2 
months of life, and half (50.1%) had palliative care initiated in this period. Only about one-fifth of all decedents (19.3%) received end-
of-life care through publicly funded home care. Less than 10% of decedents had a record of a palliative care home visit from a physician.
Conclusion: We describe methods to capture palliative care using administrative data. Despite an estimate of overall reach (51.9%) 
that is higher than previous estimates, we have shown that palliative care is infrequently delivered particularly in community settings 
and to non-cancer patients and occurs close to death.

We show, at a population-level, that cancer patients are more likely (odds ratio: 2.46; 95% confidence interval:  
2.40–2.52) to receive palliative care, while those with congestive heart failure and dementia are less likely to receive 
such care.

Little care in the community. Less than 1 in 5 received palliative home care and less than 1 in 10 received a palliative physi-

Implications for practice, theory, or policy
•
•
Linked routinely collected data can be used to examine the provision of palliative care in the population.
•
•
Overall reach of palliative care across sectors is higher than previous sector-based estimates.
•
•
However, palliative care, particularly in community settings and among non-cancer patients, remains infrequently deliv-
ered and occurs close to death.
Introduction
The aging baby boomer cohort effect1 along with an 
increasing life expectancy2 is leading to an increasingly 
aged population in many jurisdictions and an impending 
growing need for palliative care.3 Palliative care aims to 
provide relief of physical symptoms and supportive care 
for patients and their caregivers during the dying process. 
It is delivered by multiple providers, including physicians, 
nurses, and other healthcare practitioners, often in team-
based approach. A Cochrane review found that home pal-
liative services for adults with advanced illness are 
associated with positive outcomes, particularly decreased 
symptom burden and increased odds of a home death.4
Significant efforts are currently underway to understand 
and improve palliative and end-of-life care across Canada—
the setting of this study—and elsewhere. This includes ini-
tiatives undertaken by government,5,6 by coalitions,7,8 and 
led by professional bodies of healthcare practitioners.9,10 
Palliative care is provided in various care settings, includ-
ing acute care and other hospital settings, long-term care 
facilities (i.e. nursing homes), hospices, and in people’s 
homes. However, palliative care in the Canadian context, 
not unlike other jurisdictions, has been described as a 
patchwork of uncoordinated services, delivered unsystem-
atically and varying depending on the services available at 
the region, care facility, and provider levels.3,7,11 Despite 
this sentiment, there is little population- and system-wide 
data to describe the provision of palliative care across 
health sectors.7 These data are needed to highlight the true 
population reach of palliative care and identify areas where 
care can be improved and potentially better integrated.
We sought to explore, at a population level, the perva-
siveness of palliative care delivery near the end of life. Most 
previous studies have examined, in isolation, single sectors 
such as palliative home care,4 outpatient physician care,12–14 
and hospital-based palliative care.15–17 A recent study from 
England estimated the proportion of the population in high-
income countries needing palliative care (69%–82%); yet, 
this study could not find a direct estimate of the actual pro-
portion in the United Kingdom or elsewhere that receive 
such care.18 No previous study, to our knowledge, has exam-
ined the coverage of palliative care across the convergence 
of all major sectors combined, delivered by various health-
care disciplines, in and out of the context of palliative care 
specialist teams. We fill this gap using a series of popula-
tion-level, health administrative databases linked at the indi-
vidual level to capture palliative care provision across health 
sectors. This includes care provided by all physician spe-
cialties across all settings and publicly funded home care 
provided in the home by nurses, personal support workers, 
and other allied health professionals. Our objective was to 
illuminate patterns of care delivery (e.g. intensity, initiation) 
and potential gaps in care in the population.
Methods
We conducted an observational, retrospective cohort study 
examining palliative care provision to decedents in their 
last year of life. We captured all deaths in a 2-year period, 
from 1 April 2010 to 31 March 2012 (fiscal year (FY) 
2010/2011 to 2011/2012) in Ontario, a Canadian province 
with more than 13 million people. Using encrypted health 
card numbers as unique identifiers, records of healthcare 
use were linked across various administrative databases 
held at the Institute for Clinical and Evaluative Sciences 
(ICES). Ethics approval was obtained from the Sunnybrook 
Health Sciences Centre Research Ethics Board in Toronto, 
Canada, and from the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute 
Ethics Board in Ottawa, Canada.
Data sources and definitions
Deaths were identified using the Ontario Registered 
Persons Database (RPDB). The RPDB contains informa-
tion on all persons who are registered for the purposes of 
 Tanuseputro et al.

Ontario health insurance coverage and was also used to 
obtain patient age, sex, and postal code. The databases and 
codes used to identify palliative care across sectors are out-
lined in Appendix 1; more details of these databases can be 
found elsewhere.19 The decedents’ socioeconomic status 
was measured using their neighborhood income 1 year 
prior to death. Following well-established methods, both 
neighborhood income and rurality were captured by linking 
to Statistics Canada census data using postal codes.20 The 
presence of chronic conditions at death was captured using 
previously developed—and in some cases validated—
chronic disease databases at ICES.21 A total of 16 chronic 
diseases were examined (congestive heart failure, osteopo-
rosis, diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmo-
nary disease, arrhythmias, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid 
arthritis, cancer, depression, renal disease, stroke, coronary 
artery disease, asthma, previous heart attack, and dementia) 
and the total number of diseases identified was totaled for 
each individual.
Measurement of Outcomes
All records of healthcare use paid for by the provincial 
Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (MOHLTC) in the 
last year of life were retrieved. Our main outcome was 
whether a decedent had at least one record of palliative 
care in each of the health sectors examined and in all sec-
tors combined (Appendix 1). A main source of palliative 
care records was from physician billings across all special-
ties and includes—but is not limited to—claims from pal-
liative care specialists. Physician claims for palliative care 
consults were captured and designated according to where 
care was delivered: outpatient clinic, home, hospital inpa-
tient, long-term care, or complex continuing care. We 
examined palliative care delivered in the community by 
physicians—in the outpatient and home setting—and 
through publicly funded home care. For the home setting, 
physician weekly case management fees, telephone con-
sults, and codes specific to palliative care home visits were 
also captured. Publicly funded palliative home care—
delivered by nurses, personal support workers, and other 
allied healthcare workers—was captured if a client 
received an end-of-life designation by the home care pro-
gram, or if services were delivered in a hospice or pallia-
tive care unit. An end-of-life designation—typically 
reserved for those who are deemed to have less than 
6 months to life—is associated with a significant increase 
in services offered, with a palliative care philosophy.
We also examined palliative care delivered in institu-
tions; namely, in acute care hospitals (both emergency 
room visits and admissions), in complex continuing care 
facilities, and in long-term care homes. In addition to phy-
sician billing codes, consultation to a palliative care 
team—typically consisting of multi-disciplinary palliative 
care specialists—and the corresponding services were 
captured in the emergency room and in inpatient services. 
In long-term care and complex continuing care, we also 
captured hospice care delivered. Details on the codes we 
used to capture palliative care are outlined in Appendix 1.
Intensity and initiation of palliative care
The number of days that palliative care was delivered was 
observed for each sector. For acute care admissions, we 
totaled the number of days for admission that had pallia-
tive care as the most responsible reason for admission and 
conservatively counted 1 day if palliative care was only a 
contributing reason. For all other sectors, we counted the 
days on which palliative care services were recorded.
For individual and all decedents, we observed the total 
number of palliative care days delivered (i.e. intensity) in 
each of the 12 months in the last year prior to death. We 
also examined for each decedent when palliative care was 
first observed in the last year of life (i.e. initiation). For 
care intensity, we sorted individuals into quintiles of total 
unique days of care received. For initiation time, we sorted 
individuals into quintiles of days prior to death when pal-
liative care was initiated. Decedents can be in different 
quintiles within the initiation and intensity attributes. For 
each quintile, we then calculated the mean number of days 
among individuals within each quintile.
Statistical analysis
We examined differences in the characteristics (sex, age-
group, neighborhood income quintile, rurality, and chronic 
conditions) of those who received palliative care versus 
those who did not and used chi-squared tests to determine 
statistical significance. We then conducted a logistic 
regression to examine the associations of these character-
istics with the outcome of receipt of palliative care in the 
last year of life. To represent sentinel chronic diseases of 
the different non-sudden trajectories of dying, we included 
cancer (terminal illness), congestive heart failure (organ 
failure), and dementia (frailty) in the multivariable 
model.22 We included only three of the individual chronic 
conditions to minimize co-linearity introduced with the 
total number of chronic conditions. All statistical tests 
were two-tailed and p values were used to determine statis-
tical significance. We used SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., 
Cary, NC, USA) for all analyses.
Results
We captured 177,817 deaths in the 2 years of follow-up, 
51.9% of whom were observed to have at least one pallia-
tive care claim in their last year of death in any of the sec-
tors examined. About half (49.1%) of all palliative care 
days were delivered in the last 2 months of life, and half 
(50.1%) had palliative care initiated in this period.

Factors associated with palliative care receipt
Those receiving palliative care tended to have higher repre-
sentation in the middle age groups, from 55 to 85 years 
(Table 1). Those receiving palliative care tended to slightly 
live in wealthier neighborhoods and in urban areas 
(p < 0.005). They are more likely to have cancer (16.1% vs 
7.1%, p < 0.005) and less likely to have dementia (7.7% vs 
11.4%, p < 0.005). The multivariate model presented in 
Table 2 showed that males, after adjustment, were less 
likely to receive palliative care (odds ratio (OR): 0.83; 95% 
confidence interval (CI): 0.82–0.85), as were those living 
in rural regions (OR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.78–0.83). Those with 
cancer (cf. those who did not) had more than double the 
odds of receiving palliative care (OR: 2.46; 95% CI: 2.40–
2.52); conversely, those with congestive heart failure (OR: 
0.88; 95% CI: 0.86–0.91) and dementia (OR: 0.60; 95% CI: 
0.59–0.62) were less likely to receive palliative care. 
Increasing multi-morbidity was generally associated with 
decreasing likelihood of palliative care receipt.

Palliative care across health sectors
Of the 92,276 decedents receiving palliative care, a large 
proportion were identified in acute care hospitals and 
through outpatient physician claims (84.9% and 63.9%, 
respectively) (Table 3). Only about one-fifth of all dece-
dents (34,311 of 177,817, or 19.3%)—and 32.4% of 
 
the 105,869 receiving home care in their last year of life 
(data not shown)—received a designation of end of life 
or palliative from publicly funded home care. Less than 
10% of all decedents had a record of a palliative care 
home visit from a physician in their last year of life; more 
than half of these visits occurred in the month prior to 
death (data not shown).
Intensity and initiation of palliative care
Among palliative care decedents, an average of 39.6 days 
of palliative care was delivered in the last year of life 
across sectors; removing days of overlap between sectors, 
an average of 35.2 days of unique days in the last year of 
life had at least one palliative care claim (Table 4). There 
was a large difference in the intensity of palliative care 
delivered among palliative care decedents in the highest 
and lowest quintiles (1.8 mean days versus 112.8 days) 
(Table 4).
The total number of palliative care days across all sec-
tors more than doubled from the 12th month prior to death 
(69,618 days) to the 7th month prior to death (156,867

days), then almost tripled in the 3rd month (410,655 days), 
and finally more than tripled in the last month of life 
(1,251,618 days) (Figure 1). There were more palliative 
care days delivered in community-based settings (outpa-
tient physician visits, home care, long-term care) than in 
hospital-based settings (hospital inpatient care, complex 
continuing care, and emergency room visits), with the 
exception of the last month prior to death.
Examining the palliative care cohort in their last 
12 months of life, 35,824 (38.8%) had their first palliative 
care claim in the last month prior to death, and 11,093 
(12.0%) had their first palliative care claim in the second 
last month (data not shown). There was a large difference 
in the mean days prior to death that palliative care was 
initiated among the latest and earliest quintiles (3.7 versus 
314.5 days) (Table 4).
Discussion
We examined the provision of palliative care at the end-
of-life—delivered both by specialist and non-specialist 
healthcare practitioners—using population-based admin-
istrative databases across a wide range of health sectors. 
We observed that one in two in their last year of life will 
be recorded to have at least one palliative care encounter; 
this is higher than the often quoted 15%–30% population 
estimate for end-of-life hospice palliative care in 
Canada.23,24 We observed that being female, middle-aged, 
having less multi-morbidity, and living in urban and 
higher income neighborhoods were associated with palli-
ative care receipt. Further work needs to be done to 
unpack the narratives behind these associations, but dif-
ferences are likely somewhat attributable to issues of 
access and perceived futility of curative care. We also 
confirm across health sectors the often-held belief that 
cancer patients are more likely to receive palliative care 
than those on the organ failure (e.g. congestive heart fail-
ure) and frailty (e.g. dementia) trajectories.25–27
Elsewhere, Murtagh et al.18 estimated the number of 
people in England receiving palliative care to be between 
100,000 and 242,000 (20%–49%), depending on the hypo-
thetical levels of overlap across three healthcare sectors. 
Overall, it is expected that about 69%–82% of those dying 
in high-income countries will need palliative care.18 At a 
population-level, we are not aware of any other estimates 
of cross-sectoral palliative care reach—in Canada or else-
where—that is taken from direct observation. Ontario has 
a single payer system, with mainly public funding for the 
sectors examined and a mix of private (e.g. most physician 
care) and public (e.g. most hospital care) delivery of

services; these results are potentially generalizable to other 
jurisdictions with similar health systems (e.g. England, 
Norway, and Australia).28 Given that access and use of 
health services generally decline without coverage,29 we 
anticipate palliative care reach to be generally lower in 
countries with lower levels of universal coverage (e.g. 
developing nations), whether it be from a single or multi-
payer insurance. Conversely, we expect palliative care 
reach to be higher in areas in countries that devote more 
social and health resources to end-of-life care (e.g. The 
Netherlands).30
Many receiving palliative care received only a few 
encounters; one in four received two or less encounters. 
Additionally, half of encounters occurred and were initi-
ated in the 2 months prior to death, contrary to World 
Health Organization’s definition of palliative care, to be 
delivered early in the course of a disease.31 Overall, we 
observed large variation in the intensity and time of initia-
tion of palliative care. Of the palliative care observed, a 
large proportion was delivered through home care and out-
patient physician visits; however, a large number of pallia-
tive care days are also delivered in acute care hospitals, 
especially in the last month prior to death. Furthermore, 
we have shown that overall, only a small proportion of the 
decedent population will ever receive end-of-life care in 
their home through palliative home care, and even less 
from physician home visits. Our findings are consistent 
with the small number of population-based studies that 
show that only a small proportion of the population will 
receive palliative care in their home at the end of life.32,33 
It is also consistent with a recent study that compared end-
of-life care for cancer patients across seven developed 
countries, showing that Canada—along with Belgium, 
England, Germany, and Norway—was more hospital cen-
tric than The Netherlands or the United States.28
Limitations and strengths
Our estimate does not include services paid out-of-pocket 
and palliative care delivered that is not recorded as such in 
the databases. We also recognize that the underreporting of 
palliative care is a limitation in all population-level admin-
istrative data. Yet, such data currently offer the only direct 
window into palliative care in the population. The observed 
low level of palliative home visits by physicians, for exam-
ple, is likely partly due from underuse of palliative care 
billing codes; a physician home visit is captured when a 
palliative care travel code is used, or when any travel code 
is used along with a palliative care diagnosis. However, 
when we examined home visits for any reason in the last 
year of life—using well-known general travel codes that 
are linked to monetary compensation—we still observed 
that less than one in five (19.1%) of decedents will receive 
a visit in the last year of life for any reason (data not shown). 
Similarly, care that is palliative in nature is likely being 
delivered at the end of life for a significant proportion of 
Figure 1. Number of days of palliative care delivered by month prior to death for: all sectors, community-based palliative care 
(outpatient physician visits, home care, long-term care), and hospital-based palliative care (inpatient care in hospital, complex 
continuing care, and emergency room visits).

long-term care residents (the majority of long-term care 
residents in Ontario die in a long-term care facility), but is 
not coded as being palliative in nature. Our study offers the 
first look at the health administrative codes that can be used 
in the Canadian context—future work can elucidate the 
magnitude of miscoding and underreporting across differ-
ent jurisdictions.
Additionally, we examined the penetration of palliative 
care among all decedents, including those who die sud-
denly of external and other unexpected causes. Many of 
these individuals likely did not receive palliative care 
because of the acute nature of death. Only 6.5% of 
Canadian deaths in 2011 were due to external causes;34 it is 
difficult to estimate the proportion in the population dying 
unexpectedly, with one previous study in the United 
Kingdom putting an estimate of 25%.35 Partly offsetting 
our underestimation of the reach of palliative care is our 
lack of data (aside from physician services) for hospice 
palliative care; about 2500 of Ontarians die yearly in hos-
pices, or about 3% of all deaths.
The major strength of this study is the inclusion of a 
large set of health sectors, linked at the individual level, for 
a large population-based cohort of decedents. This allows 
direct observation of palliative care provision in the entire 
population for the major healthcare sectors, largely gener-
alizable to other Canadian provinces and other high-
income countries with publicly funded health care. This 
information provides feedback to the healthcare system on 
its provision of palliative care across different settings and 
by proximity to death.
Conclusion
We have demonstrated the feasibility and challenges of 
capturing meaningful palliative care across health sectors 
using linked administrative data. Similar studies on pallia-
tive and/or end-of-life care could be conducted in jurisdic-
tions with population-level data linked across health 
sectors (e.g. in many other Canadian provinces, the United 
Kingdom, Australia, and Scandinavian countries).28 Such 
work enables a variety of future work including those that 
monitor quality of care, examine the supporting factors that 
improve access to palliative care, evaluate the effect of pal-
liative care on outcomes, and evaluate the effect of inter-
ventions to improve access and outcomes. Sector-specific 
data are most meaningful when they describe well-defined 
palliative care services, such as palliative physician home 
visits and a palliative home care program.
Health care at the end of life in many populations, 
including in Canada, predominantly occurs in acute care 
institutions.28,32,33 Our findings show that palliative care 
follows this pattern. This is in stark contrast to the finding 
that the majority of the population prefer to die at home, 
with four-fifths not changing preference as their illness pro-
gressed.36 We have also shown that there is large variation 
in the intensity and timing of care, with many receiving 
little care, and a significant proportion of care initiated and 
delivered close to death.
Augmenting palliative home care programs and increas-
ing palliative care delivered by physicians in both outpa-
tient and home settings require addressing a complex web 
of barriers. This likely includes improving training, ensur-
ing adequate remuneration, improving the use of prognos-
tic tools, and, for physicians, providing protected time for 
home visits. Palliative care also needs to focus on targeting 
patient populations less likely to receive care, including 
those without cancer. Both palliative home care and physi-
cian home visits have been shown to improve outcomes at 
the end of life.4 Ontario and other jurisdictions can con-
tinue its efforts to support aging and dying in appropriate 
places of care by improving the reach of palliative care to 
the dying.
