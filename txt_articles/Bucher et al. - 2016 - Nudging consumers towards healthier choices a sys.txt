Abstract
Nudging or ‘choice architecture’ refers to strategic changes in the environment that are anticipated to alter people’s behaviour in a predictable
way, without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives. Nudging strategies may be used to promote healthy
eating behaviour. However, to date, the scientific evidence has not been systematically reviewed to enable practitioners and policymakers to
implement, or argue for the implementation of, specific measures to support nudging strategies. This systematic review investigated the effect
of positional changes of food placement on food choice. In total, seven scientific databases were searched using relevant keywords to identify
interventions that manipulated food position (proximity or order) to generate a change in food selection, sales or consumption, among
normal-weight or overweight individuals across any age group. From 2576 identified articles, fifteen articles comprising eighteen studies met
our inclusion criteria. This review has identified that manipulation of food product order or proximity can influence food choice. Such
approaches offer promise in terms of impacting on consumer behaviour. However, there is a need for high-quality studies that quantify the
magnitude of positional effects on food choice in conjunction with measuring the impact on food intake, particularly in the longer term. Future
studies should use outcome measures such as change in grams of food consumed or energy intake to quantify the impact on dietary intake
and potential impacts on nutrition-related health. Research is also needed to evaluate potential compensatory behaviours secondary to such
interventions.
Key words: Nudging: Choice architecture: Food position: Proximity: Order: Food choices: Environmental influences
In recent years, there has been a shift away from solely targeting
individuals
to
change
their
eating
behaviours
to
an
approach that addresses wider, population-level factors and
involves other environmental components and stakeholders(1).
Foodscapes(2)
and
food
environments
contribute
to
the
so-called ‘obesogenic environment’(1,3) and influence food
choices. Epidemiological data suggest that numerous small
changes towards a healthier behaviour such as improving diet
quality have the potential to have a positive impact on reducing
mortality risk(4). Most healthy eating interventions in Europe
have been successful in providing consumers with information
to enable them to make better-informed food choices(5).
Although they have been successful in creating awareness
among consumers, there has only been modest success in terms
of actual lifestyle changes and measurable health indicators
in the sample populations, such as weight reduction(6).
Individualised
behaviour
change
is
ineffective
unless
it
becomes habit forming, which requires support and reinforce-
ment through structural or environmental change so that the
new behaviour is sustained. Although behavioural economics
have impacted on some policy interventions, the case for food-
related interventions remains under development, constituting a
promising area that could potentially achieve high social
benefits(7,8).
Therefore, innovative intervention strategies that are able to
effectively improve food behaviours, dietary intake and impact
on health status need to be investigated and implemented. The
majority of interventions have an underlying assumption that
people make conscious and reasoned food choices, most of the
time(9). This paradigm has been questioned following the
limited impact of information-based campaigns in achieving
behaviour change, and the subsequent rise in the prevalence of
obesity and other chronic diseases(10). Furthermore, current
paradigms place the burden and responsibility for all food

 choices on the individual, with the justification that everyone is
free to make healthy choices once informed(6,11).
Dietary habits and food choices are the result of decisions
and actions that are based on routines that require very little
active decision making as well as reflective, elaborate decision
making where choice options are carefully considered. Choice
architecture, inspired by behavioural economics, describes the
way in which decisions are influenced based on how choices
are
presented
within
meal
environments(12).
The
meal
environment has been defined as the room, the people, the
food, the atmosphere and the management system, particularly
when eating out of home. This suggests that the meal
environment can be modified to be more or less conducive to
support the required behaviour and as such may lead to weight
changes, either through promotion of healthier choices or
through decreased intake(12–15).
Choice architecture is often used interchangeably with other
terms such as nudging, libertarian paternalism and behavioural
economics. Choice architecture is a subset of non-regulatory
behavioural interventions. Choice architecture can include one
or more of the following: provision of information (e.g. to
activate a rational choice), changes in the physical environment
(e.g. light, décor, placement, etc.), changes in the default policy
(e.g. pre-weighed salad portions v. free serving of a salad bowl)
and use of social norms and salience (e.g. comparison with
average consumers)(16). Nudging has been defined as any aspect
of the choice architecture that alters people’s behaviour in a
predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly
changing their economic incentives(15). Within the public health
nutrition area, this could mean altering the food environment,
such as product placement or labelling or even encouraging
consumers to sit together for their meal (social facilitation).
Furthermore, nudging interventions consist of provision of
information, changes to physical environment, changes to the
default policy and the use of social norms and salience(16).
Previous studies have shown that nudging practices are
promising measures that can be used to support the promotion of
healthy eating. An example of nudging is that by changing the
size of dishware, portion sizes may be reduced leading to
unconscious changes in actual food intake(17) and meal compo-
sition(18). Similarly, food positioning is thought to influence food
choice. Studies have shown that people eat more unhealthy food
such as chocolate if it is located more prominently(19). However, it
is less clear whether minor changes in food position or item
placement, which are not accompanied by changes in effort, also
promote healthier food choices(13,20).
Existing systematic reviews that have investigated the effec-
tiveness of choice architecture interventions have mainly
focused on the effectiveness of labelling and prompting(21,22).
However, these types of interventions are more closely related
to the traditional behavioural interventions of information
giving(23). To date, there is no systematic review that has
assessed the influence of food placement within micro-
environments on product choice and on food intake(23). This
information is relevant for the support of public health inter-
ventions and relevant for operations in the food service sector.
The aims of this systematic review were to evaluate
published articles that have investigated the effect of positional
changes within microenvironments on food choice by healthy
weight and overweight individuals across all age groups and to
derive recommendations for future research in the area.
For the purpose of this review, we have defined a nudging
intervention
as
any
intervention
that
involves
altering
the
non-economic properties or placement of objects or stimuli within
micro-environments with the intention of changing health-related
behaviour. Such interventions are implemented within the same
micro-environment in which the target behaviour is performed and
require minimal conscious engagement. In principle, these
interventions can influence the behaviour of many people
simultaneously, and they are not targeted or tailored to specific
individuals (adapted from Hollands et al.(23)). The present review
focuses
on
positional
changes
that
affect
immediate
food
consumption or choice decisions of individuals (e.g. eating out of
home in a food service outlet), rather than the consumption pattern
of a family or a household over time, as it would be the case in
‘assortment structure’ experiments within supermarket settings.
Methods
Details of the protocol for this systematic review were registered
on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews
(PROSPERO) and can be accessed at http://www.crd.york.ac.
uk/PROSPERO/display_record.asp?ID=CRD42015016277
Criteria for study inclusion
The PICOS (Problem, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome,
Setting) approach(24) was used to frame the research question.
We defined ‘food choice’ as all outcome measures that assessed
food selection or probability of food choice, including product
sales and food consumption (in grams or energy intake).
Positional changes were defined as all manipulations of food
order or variations in the distance of food placement relative to
consumers
within
microenvironments.
Microenvironments
were defined as the immediate surroundings of the individuals,
such as within the home, workplace or cafeterias(25).
The types of studies to be included were randomised-
controlled trials/experiments, pre–post experimental studies,
quasi experiments and naturalistic observations where at least
one research aim was to assess the influence of food posi-
tioning within a microenvironment on food choice (selection)
or sales (grams, number) and intake (grams, energy).
Studies where multiple variables were manipulated simulta-
neously along with the food position were not included. For
example, studies where foods were added or removed from the
selection or where portion sizes of healthy or unhealthy offers
were altered along with a positional change were excluded.
Study participants included only healthy, normal-weight or
overweight/obese individuals. There was no age restriction
with studies on both children and adults included. The search
included full-text articles that were published in peer-reviewed
journals in the English language.
Literature search
A systematic search was conducted using electronic databases

on publication date. The search term list included the following
items: choice architecture OR accessib* OR nudg* OR position*
OR (serving AND (direction OR distance)) OR proximity OR
distance AND food OR diet OR food choice OR energy intake OR
caloric restriction OR fruits OR vegetables OR health* OR food
choice. Reference lists of included articles and key reviews in the
area were also manually searched for additional articles.
Review procedure
Two independent reviewers (T. B. and N. D. V./D. V. d. B.)
screened the titles and abstracts of all search results. Full texts of
all papers that appeared to potentially meet the inclusion cri-
teria were retrieved. The retrieved full texts were assessed by
two independent reviewers (T. B. and N. D. V.) to determine
inclusion. In case of disagreement, a third independent
reviewer made the final decision (M. E. R.).
Data extraction and synthesis
Quantitative data on study participants (age, sex, weight status),
the design (type of study, setting, manipulated variables) and the
outcomes (finding, main effect, conclusions) from the included
articles were extracted by T. B. and checked by M. E. R. To
distinguish between the magnitude of the change in effort that
was involved in the intervention, we differentiated between
minor changes (mere order change or very small distance
change within reach), medium (change of position to food that
required only a small effort, e.g. standing up, bending down) or
major positional changes (manipulations that involved a major
increase/reduction in effort, e.g. walking across a room).
Quality assessment of included studies
The quality of the included studies was assessed by two inde-
pendent reviewers (T. A. M. and H. T.) using the review evi-
dence analysis manual published by the Academy of Nutrition
and Dietetics(26). The quality scores can be found in the online
Supplementary Table S1.
Results
The database search identified 2540 unique entries, which were
combined with another thirty-six articles of interest that were
identified by screening reference lists. A total of sixty-two full-
text articles were retrieved and assessed against the inclusion
criteria. In total, fifteen articles, comprising eighteen studies,
met the inclusion criteria and the data from these were
extracted and evaluated in this review (see Fig. 1).
The majority (n 10) of studies were conducted in the USA;
seven were conducted in Europe, of which four were con-
ducted in the Netherlands. In one study, the country was not
reported(27).
There
was
only
one
study
on
children(28).
Moreover, ten studies were conducted with university students
or staff, and for five studies the subjects were customers of
hospital cafeterias. Only one study was conducted in an Army
research centre(29) and one was conducted with attendees of a
health conference(30).
The foods involved in the studies varied and included single
healthy or unhealthy items (water, fruit and vegetable, cereal
bars, chocolate candy or crackers) to more complex selections
within canteen buffets with between eight and eleven products
repositioned.
Among all, seven studies reported participants’ weight status;
however, only two considered it in the analysis(27,31). Levitz(27)
reported that a change in dessert order affected normal-weight
and overweight people differently. In particular, the author
found that obese adults selected a greater amount of low-
energy dessert if it was made more salient. No changes were
observed
if
the
high-energy
desserts
were
made
more
salient(27).
The characteristics of the included studies are summarised in
Table 1.
Of the eighteen studies that were included, only one received
a positive quality rating(32), with fourteen studies being assessed
as neutral and three as negative, because study procedures
were not described in detail and several validity questions could
not be answered clearly (online Supplementary Table S1).
Of the eighteen studies, nine investigated the effect of
distance/proximity changes on food choice, such as placing
unhealthy foods further from the consumer. The other half
assessed whether changes in product order, such as, for
example, the food sequence on a buffet, could have a beneficial
influence on food selection.
In summary, sixteen of the eighteen studies concluded that
positional changes had a positive influence on food choice. The
only two studies that did not find an effect manipulated the pro-
duct order of snacks on a computer screen (Van Kleef Study 1),
as well as within a shelf at a checkout counter in a cafeteria
(Van Kleef Study 2). However, in the field study, they found a
trend towards sales of healthy food being positively affected(32).

 It was not possible to quantify and directly compare the effect
sizes of the included studies, as the study designs were too
variable. Most of the studies were randomised-controlled
experiments, and only one study used correlation analysis to
study the relationship between distance and snack selection(28).
This study found that the distance from the serving bowl sig-
nificantly predicted the number of crackers and carrot slices
consumed by children(28).
Between-subject experiments were the most common study
design, whereas within-subject, repeated-measures designs
were rarely used. Only one study used a longitudinal design(33),
which was a follow-up assessment of the intervention described
by Thorndike et al.(34) and was based on the same choice
architecture intervention. Both of these studies were retained in
the review because they had assessed different outcome
measures and were complementary.
Most studies assessed food selection or choice probability
using χ2 tests, whereas only a few studies objectively measured
actual food intake in terms of food weight (g) or energy
(kJ/kcal) content. The intervention description and findings of
the included studies are summarised in Table 2.
Discussion
Out of eighteen studies where food position or order was
manipulated, sixteen showed a positive effect on food choice,
meaning that the participants were nudged towards a more
healthy food choice. In the two experiments(32) where posi-
tional changes had no impact on food choice, the degree of
manipulation was only a minor change in position, with all the
foods remaining within reach. This indicates that the strength of
the effect appears to depend on the type of positional manip-
ulation (order v. distance), as well as the magnitude of the
change, or how far away foods are placed.
Only one study assessed compensatory food choices(35),
showing that changes in position resulted in compensatory
choices within same food categories. Further, movement of
potato chips to a more distant location, and hence a reduction
in chips selection, was accompanied by an increase in
starch selection choices among the foods that still remained
proximal(35). For portion size changes, there is some evidence
from previous research that reducing offered portion sizes
does not result in immediate compensation(36). However, in
that particular study, the intervention was conscious, and
consumers’ self-control was activated by having servers ask
customers in a fast food restaurant whether they wanted to
downsize portions. Other studies, in which the overall energy of
a meal bundle for children was reduced, without the partici-
pants being aware, found that the overall energy intake was
significantly reduced(37). More research on compensatory
behaviours is required to implement effective interventions in
practice.
The overall quality of the included studies was neutral. Only
a few papers described the procedures sufficiently well to allow
a clear evaluation of all validity questions. In particular, the
questions that related to subject selection, recruitment proce-
dures and comparison of study groups were unclear or not

 applicable. Studies were classified as unclear or not being free
from bias because of the use of cash incentives or course credit
being offered to participants. This may be an artifact of the
naturalistic setting of the studies, such as universities and
workplace canteens.
There is a lack of research investigating long-term outcomes
of positional interventions, and it is not clear whether changes
in product order or distance would have sustained effects.
Specifically, it is unclear whether a potentially positive effect of
a position change, such as placing healthy foods in obvious
positions and very close to cafeteria check-out lines, would
potentially diminish over time and that customers would return
to selecting a favoured unhealthy snack. To investigate this,
more studies have to be conducted that evaluate this. Changes
in choice need to be assessed at different time points, ideally
over several weeks and months – for example, using data from
a customer loyalty card scheme to determine sustainability of
the intervention.
Furthermore, only one study(38) assessed the effect of
potential covariates such as food preferences, restrained or
disinhibited eating styles or health consciousness on the out-
comes of position choice architecture interventions. It therefore
remains unclear which individuals are susceptible to nudges.
Further insight on these covariates, as well as potential influ-
ences
of
habit strength,
is
required
to
design
effective
interventions.
A reason for these data not being reported may be that it is
important to ensure participants are not aware of the nudging
intervention, and this is likely to be the reason most field studies
did not collect this information from participants. A method that
could be used to address this limitation in future research would
be to implement interventions within settings where customer
loyalty cards are used to collect additional data on participants’
actual purchases. For this purpose, collaborations with industry
or supermarket chains could be effective. This would also have
the advantage that potential product price and positioning
interactions could be assessed.
Previous literature suggests that nudges could be inexpensive
approaches to positively impact behaviours(15). In the studies
included in this review, however, there were no calculations on
potential costs and
benefits. Factual data on previously
hypothesised benefits are required to make effective recom-
mendations for policymakers.
Only
two
studies
differentiated
between
healthy
and
overweight consumers and whether positional interventions
were
different
based
on
body
weight(27,31).
They
both
concluded that the positional nudges were effective irrespective
of weight status. Further, one study assessed socio-economic
status and reported that it had no influence on whether
positional interventions were effective(33). These findings con-
cur with previous literature, which suggest that nudging effects
work via subconscious mechanisms, and therefore have equal
impact regardless of weight and socio-economic status(39).
Food position can be manipulated by changing the order of
food products or by changing the distance between the food
and the consumer. Both of these nudges operate in different
ways. The mediating factor for the effect of distance on choice
is thought to be effort, whereas for change in order it is reported
to be salience(38). Changes in order normally constitute only a
minor change in effort, whereas changes in distance affect the
effort required in order to obtain a food at various levels.
However, more research is needed to evaluate these two
aspects in detail. Future research should also clearly distinguish
between studies that examine nudging in terms of food order v.
food proximity or distance.
To date, very little is known about why positional nudges
could be effective, and, in particular, it remains unclear how
effects are moderated. The dual-process model(40) states that
human behaviour largely results as a function of two interacting
systems: the reflective system, which generates decisions based
on knowledge about facts and values, and the impulsive
system, which elicits behaviour through affective responses.
The first system requires cognitive capacity, whereas the second
system requires no cognitive effort and is driven by feelings and
immediate behaviours in response to the environment. Nudging
is thought to operate mainly through the second, automatic
system and affects all individuals equally. However, it remains
to be elucidated whether and how factors such as health
consciousness,
habits
or
strong
preferences
for
specific
products interact with the effects. The research of Levy et al.(33)
suggests that once the social gradient effects are taken into
consideration, there is still an effect towards the desired
outcome in terms of food choices. This indicates that these
interventions could be powerful and that cheap nudging
interventions could potentially yield more than other elaborate
expensive campaigns do. However, further research is required
to explore this in detail.
It was not possible to conduct a meta-analysis of effect sizes
as a wide range of outcome measures were reported across
studies. Although the evidence that food position influences
food choice was consistent across studies, it was not possible to
evaluate the impact and effect size of these types of choice
architecture interventions on actual food consumption and
subsequent
health
outcomes.
As
has
been
advocated
previously(6), harmonised indicators are required that would
allow comparability between experiments or interventions. We
therefore strongly recommend the use of energy (kJ/kcal) or
weight (g) as outcome measures of changes in food selection
and/or intake in future studies.
Strengths and limitations
This is the first systematic review that has assessed the influence
of position interventions (proximity and order) on food choice.
In addition to the terms ‘nudging’ and ‘choice architecture’, we
used search terms such as ‘distance’ and ‘position’. This strategy
located many articles that were beyond the topic of interest
such as access to fast food outlets, but ensured that older
literature published before the terms ‘choice architecture’ and
‘nudging’ became popular were included.
For the purpose of this review, we defined nudging as any
intervention that involved altering the non-economic properties
or placement of objects or stimuli within microenvironments,
with
the
intention
of
changing
health-related
behaviour
(adapted from Hollands et al.(23)). We acknowledge that vary-
ing definitions of this term exist and that a disparate definition

 of the term might have led to the inclusion of different studies,
and hence influence the conclusions drawn.
Literature investigating the effect of the assortment structure
on buying behaviour within supermarkets was not identified
with the present search strategy. The authors are aware that
supermarket-related shopping behaviour has been extensively
described in the marketing literature, and that it is one of the
venues where behavioural interventions may have a socially
relevant outcome(7,41). This aspect was beyond the scope of the
present study, which focused mainly on out-of-home meal
service situations such as cafeterias or canteens. Factors
affecting selection at the time of consumption and the time of
purchase may differ in this situation.
In addition, it is relevant to note that there could be
differences between nudges that aim to increase or decrease
consumption, as well as between nudges that promote the choice
of healthy foods v. nudges that discourage the consumption of
unhealthy foods. As an example, it might be easier to promote the
consumption of more (healthy) food, compared with discoura-
ging the consumption of unhealthy (or preferred) food by
positional changes. Studies in which the positions of unhealthy
and healthy foods are simply switched are particularly proble-
matic, as they lack a neutral control group, which would enable
researchers to disentangle whether there was a potential bias in
effectiveness of nudging depending on the food. In the present
literature, studies that strategically investigated the efficacy of the
positional intervention depending on food type are missing.
This review did not specifically consider any grey literature.
Given the heterogeneity and the limited number of studies
retrieved via the search strategy, it is plausible that a positive
publication bias exists, although this was not assessed by the
authors. It is interesting to note that the paternalistic nature of
the concept of nudging has been discussed. In particular, it can
be argued that a positional change that results in high effort to
obtain an unhealthier food may be seen as a reduction in
freedom of choice(42–45). However, owing to the ethical nature
of this discussion, it is beyond the scope of this review.
The synthesis of the study findings was undertaken in a nar-
rative format as data aggregation was limited by the hetero-
geneity of the research in this field. Nevertheless, the current
review identified gaps in the existing literature and where further
research is needed.
Recommendations for laboratory studies
Although laboratory settings are limited, well-planned experi-
ments could give insight into the strength of positional effects,
and therefore help estimate the cost-effectiveness of choice
architecture interventions in practice, particularly if repeated
measures are applied. Laboratory settings allow the follow-up
of the same individuals for data collection. Quantifiable out-
come measures such as change in energy (kJ/kcal) or weight
(g) of food selection or consumption should be used. Strong
experimental evidence including estimations of the potential
health benefits secondary to a reduction in energy intake or
consumer weight loss over time is needed to inform policy-
makers in terms of implementing choice architecture interven-
tions in public health settings.
Recommendations for field experiments
Although previous research suggested that substitution might
occur within the same product category following a choice
architecture intervention(35), a trial in the Belgian city of Ghent
showed that meal choices were not compensated for later in the
day(46). Hence, future research should address the issue of
compensation at the design stage and consider that compen-
satory behaviours could occur after a nudge intervention.
As for laboratory settings, we also strongly recommend the
use of energy or grams of food selected/consumed as an
objective outcome measure, to estimate effect sizes and
potential health benefits.
Furthermore, insight into factors (e.g. preferences, habit
strengths, health consciousness) that potentially influence the
effectiveness of positional interventions could be gained by
collecting more information on customers in cafeteria-style
settings – for example, via a loyalty card scheme. This would
further allow exploration of the sustainability (decay of effect over
time or potential compensatory choices) over time in these
settings.
Reporting recommendations
The eighteen studies included in this review did not consistently
describe the choice architecture intervention that was being
assessed – for example, whether ‘the nudge’ was a change in
distance or in product positioning. On the other hand, the
inclusion of distance in combination with food resulted in a
large number of search results that were not relevant for the
purpose of this study.
We suggest that standardised keywords and vocabulary
could assist this field of research. Researchers should carefully
consider the wording for their reports and could adopt the
terminologies suggested by Hollands et al.(23) to classify choice
architecture interventions more clearly.
Advice for practice (policymakers, food retailers)
Choice architecture recommendations could support existing
dietary guidelines, and thus potentially contribute to the
adherence and compliance. Although more research is required
to quantify the magnitude of positional influences on health
outcomes, it is evident that choice architecture is important and
that food retailers influence consumption by organising and
displaying their products. Therefore, persons in charge of food
organisation or food outlet design (e.g. workplaces) need to be
aware of their responsibility to organise ‘foodscapes’ in an
optimal way – for example, to stimulate consumption of healthy
foods and to reduce the consumption of unhealthy foods that
then could support healthy workplace initiatives. In practical
terms, this means that low-energy, nutrient-dense products such
as fruits and vegetables should be placed in easily accessible
and prominent positions. This is particularly applicable in large
self-serving setting such a school or work canteens or the
canteens of residences for the elderly.
Policymakers could integrate choice architecture nudging
measures to augment their existing policy documents as an
important measure to enhance the effectiveness of healthy

 eating policies and procedures. In particular, this review
provides evidence for policymakers, and specifically supports
the use of positional changes as an effective manner to alter
food choice in a desirable way.
Furthermore, the results of this review could be used
for developing official recommendations regarding the imple-
mentation of choice architectural nudge interventions and to
harmonise the indicators for evaluation of the effect. A good
practice example would be to place salad at the beginning of
the buffet in school canteens in countries where meals are
provided at school.
Conclusions
Although the evidence that food position influences food choice
is consistent, it is difficult to quantify the magnitude of impact on
food choice and intake and the effect size of these choice
architecture interventions on actual food consumption and
subsequent health outcomes. Use of harmonised terminology
and indicators would allow comparability between experiments
or interventions and assist in moving this field forward.
