Brief report
Do English mental health services know whether
they followed N.I.C.E. guidelines with patients who
killed themselves?

Freedom of Information Act requests sent to 51 NHS mental health providers in England
showed an average of 20.5 suicides per organization. Only one provider, however, could
report how many people that had killed themselves had been offered N.I.C.E.
recommended psychological therapy. Information that might prevent suicides is being
ignored.
Practitioner points
� Mental health services need, urgently, to develop data systems that can inform clinical team leaders
about gaps in their services to suicidal people in their care
� Clinical psychologists have a particular responsibility to pressure managers to effectively monitor the
provision of evidence-based treatments to suicidal people
� Trusts and commissioners must be aware of, and rectify, any failings of their services in relation to the
prevention of suicide
Risk of suicide is one of the reasons people are compulsorily detained, assessed, and
treated by mental health services. Gathering and analysing data related to whether
these services do prevent suicide, and – if so – how, should be of paramount
importance. A 2016 national report on suicide in mental health services identified
ten ‘key elements of safer care in mental health services’ (Appleby et al., 2016). One
was ‘Implementing NICE guidance on depression and self-harm.’ NICE guidelines for
the treatment of depression recommend, for mild to moderate depression, an
antidepressant or CBT or Interpersonal Therapy (IPT); and, for moderate or severe
depression, a combination of antidepressants and either CBT or IPT. Counselling or
short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy is recommended for people who decline
the other treatments (N.I.C.E., 2016). The 2016 report did not, unfortunately,
present any data on mental health Trusts’ implementation of these guidelines.

 Method
Ethical approval was unnecessary as the study involved no interactions with patients.
A Freedom of Information (FOI) request was piloted on two NHS Trusts. After making
it simpler and shorter, to maximize response rate, it was sent to 51 NHS mental health
providers, in November 2016. It asked for:
Number of suicides from 1 January 2012 to 31 October 2016:
1. Average years in MH services of the people who committed suicide
2. In the 12 months prior to the suicide –
i.
How many were offered a NICE recommended psychological therapy?
ii.
How many received at least one session (excluding assessments) of NICE
recommended psychological therapy?
iii. What psychological intervention did they receive?
iv. Number offered multidisciplinary assessment
v.
Number offered medication
vi. Number in receipt of medication
vii. Number offered ECT
viii. Number in receipt of ECT
3. What evidence are you using for these figures?
Results
FOI compliance rates
Five of the 51 organizations failed to respond. Five acknowledged the request but did not
respond further. Three stated they were not subject to the FOI Act because they were ‘a
private company’, ‘a non-for-profit charity organization and a registered independent
hospital’, or ‘not a public authority’. Ten could not provide any of the information
requested because it would take too long to collate it, often citing relevant provisions in
the Act. Thus, 23 of the 51 (45.1%) failed to provide any information.
Twenty-seven (52.9%) answered only the question about number of suicides. Only one
(the 2gether NHS Foundation Trust) also provided information about how many of the
people had been offered and/or received the various treatments. Almost all (24) of the 27
who failed to provide data about treatments cited the provisions in the Act about time and
expense, with some explaining that only by a manual trawl of individual patients’ records
could the requested information be obtained.
Suicide rates
Among the 28 Trusts providing numbers (for January 2012 to October 2016), there was a
total of 2,780 suicides. There was a substantial range, from 29 to 261 (mean: 99.3; SD: 48.3).
The average number of suicides per Trust annually (i.e., divided by 4.833 years) was 20.5.
The single Trust complying with the request, 2gether NHS Foundation Trust,
reported 77 suicides, at an average of 15.9 per year. The Trust indicated that 63 (81.8%)
had been offered medication and 61 (79.2%) had used it. It was reported that 47 (61.0%)
had been offered psychological therapy and 27 (35.1%) had used it. None had been offered
electroconvulsive therapy. There had been 41 ‘multidisciplinary assessments’. The 77
people had, on average, been ‘in service’ for 4 years. This information had been compiled

Reports’.
Discussion
FOI compliance
One third of FOI requests across all government bodies are fully responded to (Cabinet
Office, 2016). This was the case, however, for just one Trust (2%). Although this may be
partly due to inadequate staffing, the gathering and sharing of data about suicide, within
and between services, should surely be of the highest priority.
Number of suicides
Multiplying 20.5 (the average number of suicides annually per organization) by 51 (the
number of mental health service providers) produces an estimate of 1,025 patient suicides
per year. This is similar to the 1,266 calculated by the 2016 national report (Appleby et al.,
2016). One might hope that unit managers and service commissioners have easy access, in
collated form, to all the pertinent data (including data about access to treatments that
might have prevented the suicide) from the medical records, to inform efforts to prevent
suicides in their services. If this were so, however, the Trusts would easily have been able
to extract the information requested, from these collated summaries. It seems essential
that the lessons learned from the many hours investigating each individual tragedy should
be understood in the context of the other 20 or so occurring each year in the same service,
to enable a systemic approach to the prevention of further suicides.
Accessing suicide-related information
The UK government just published a National Suicide Prevention Strategy (Public Health
England,2017).One ofits five action areas is ‘Improving data at nationaland local level and
how this data is used to help take action and target efforts more accurately’.
Given that preventing suicide is one of the primary purposes of any mental health
service, and one of the justifications for forcibly detaining and medicating people, services
must have systems for monitoring compliance with NICE guidelines.
It is concerning that 45% of the organizations provided no information. It seems
particularly problematic that we found four private organizations operating beyond the
jurisdiction of the FOI Act. Three stated this explicitly. One simply ignored the request.
There should be a level playing field for NHS providers and private organizations serving
NHS patients.
A recent meta-analysis of 131 randomized trials found no difference between
antidepressants and placebos for suicides, suicide attempts, or suicide ideation (Jakobsen
et al., 2017). Access to NICE recommended psychological therapies may therefore be
even more important than previously thought.
Limitations
It is conceivable that some Trusts had an accessible report containing the relevant
information, but their FOI Officer was unaware of it. This would mean, however, that the
people s/he asked were also unaware.
