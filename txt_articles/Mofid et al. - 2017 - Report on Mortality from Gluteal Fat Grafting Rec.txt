Abstract
Background: Gluteal fat grafting is among the fastest growing aesthetic procedures in the United States and around the world. Given numerous an-
ecdotal and published reports of fatal and nonfatal pulmonary fat embolism resulting from this procedure, the Aesthetic Surgery Education and Research 
Foundation (ASERF) formed a Task Force to study this complication.
Objectives: To determine the incidence of fatal and nonfatal pulmonary fat embolism associated with gluteal fat grafting and provide recommenda-
tions to decrease the risks of the procedure.
Methods: An anonymous web-based survey was sent to 4843 plastic surgeons worldwide. Additional data on morbidity and mortality was collected 
through confidential interviews with plastic surgeons and medical examiners, public records requests for autopsy reports in the United States, and through 
the American Association for the Accreditation of Ambulatory Surgical Facilities (AAAASF).
Results: Six hundred and ninety-two (692) surgeons responding to the survey reported 198,857 cases of gluteal fat grafting. Over their careers, sur-
geons reported 32 fatalities from pulmonary fat emboli as well as 103 nonfatal pulmonary fat emboli. Three percent (3%) of respondents experienced a 
patient fatality and 7% of respondents reported at least one pulmonary fat embolism in a patient over their careers. Surgeons reporting the practice of 
injecting into the deep muscle experienced a significantly increased incidence rate of fatal and nonfatal pulmonary fat emboli. Twenty-five fatalities were 
confirmed in the United States over the last 5 years through of autopsy reports and interviews with surgeons and medical examiners. Four deaths were 
reported from 2014 to 2015 from pulmonary fat emboli in AAAASF facilities.
Conclusions: Despite the growing popularity of gluteal fat grafting, significantly higher mortality rates appear to be associated with gluteal fat grafting 
than with any other aesthetic surgical procedure. Based on this survey, fat injections into the deep muscle, using cannulae smaller than 4 mm, and point-
ing the injection cannula downwards should be avoided. More research is necessary to increase the safety of this procedure.

The demand for gluteal augmentation with autologous 
fat has increased dramatically over the last five years. 
According to statistics from the American Society for 
Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ASAPS), “core physicians” 
(plastic surgeons, dermatologists, and facial plastic sur-
geons) performed 18,487 of these procedures in 2015 com-
pared to 7382 in 2011.1 For the purposes of tabulation of 
procedural statistics, the number of cases performed by 
nonplastic surgeons is included in estimates provided by 
ASAPS (however, the Task Force believes that nonplas-
tic surgeons should not be considered “core” specialists 
for this procedure.) It is estimated that as many as 25% 
more of these procedures are performed by non-core 
physicians, resulting in a total of approximately 23,108 
procedures performed last year in the United States. The 
popular consumer website RealSelf (Seattle, WA) reported 
that in 2015 there were 7.2 million visits to buttock aug-
mentation pages, a 32% increase from 2014. This num-
ber of visits was exceeded only by inquiries into breast 
augmentation, the most popular aesthetic surgical proce-
dure.2 The online forum reports high patient satisfaction 
and a general unawareness by patients and surgeons of 
the risk of severe complications.
There have been anecdotal and published reports of 
mortality from this procedure including a retrospective 
survey and autopsy-based study documenting 22 deaths 
over 10 and 15 years respectively in Mexico and Colombia 
from pulmonary fat emboli (PFE).3 As the total numbers 
of cases performed in those countries over the study 
period was not provided, the incidence of fatal PFE was 
undetermined. The very first case report of a fatal PFE 
from gluteal fat grafting was published in the pathology 
literature in 2015.4 Because of its concern and commit-
ment to patient safety and given the significance of these 
findings and news reports in the lay press,5-9 the ASERF 
formed a Task Force of 11 surgeons, pathologists, and 
statisticians to study the risks of both fatal and nonfatal 
PFEs from gluteal fat grafting as well as any potential 
variables affecting these risks.
METHODS
A 15 question survey (Sogo Survey, Herndon, VA) was 
created by the Task Force to query surgeons about num-
bers of cases performed, depth and angulation of injec-
tion, size and type of cannulae used for grafting, access 
and approach used, and the number of fatal and nonfatal 
PFEs occurring over the last 12 months and over their 
career. Additional questions were asked about geographic 
location. The survey was sent in July 2016 to 4843 active 
members of the American Society of Aesthetic Plastic 
Surgeons (ASAPS, 1963 members) and the International 
Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ISAPS, 2880 mem-
bers) and results collected over 14 days with three 
separate email reminders to survey recipients. All dupli-
cate ASAPS/ISAPS members were excluded from mutual 
member roster rolls so that individuals would be counted 
in either one or the other membership society only. All 
responses were anonymous and imported into an Excel 
(Microsoft, Redmond, WA) spreadsheet. In order to 
assure physicians of absolute privacy, it was unknown 
whether an individual surgeon had filled out the survey 
and it is possible that a surgeon may have completed it 
more than once. A variable was defined as each potential 
answer for every closed-ended question. Surgeons had 
the option of selecting more than one answer per ques-
tion and the variables were consequently not mutually 
exclusive.
Individual rates of complications were calculated 
for each of the variables. Since each variable was either 
selected or not as an answer to each question, the rates 
of complication (fatal and nonfatal PFEs) were calculated 
for both “yes” and “no” answers for each variable. To 
account for the varying number of cases per surgeon, the 
rates of “yes” and “no” answers were then analyzed using 
a Poisson rate test to obtain a P value for each variable. In 
addition, incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated for 
each variable in order to assess their unadjusted effect on 
the rate of complications. Finally, to tease out the inde-
pendent contribution of each variable on the risk of PFEs, 
we used a backwards selection Poisson multivariate regres-
sion analysis to estimate the adjusted incidence rate ratio 
of fatal and nonfatal PFEs associated with each variable, 
along with the corresponding P value and 95% confidence 
interval. Other descriptive statistics were calculated such as 
surgeon experience, risk of complications for any surgeon 
who reported at least one case, and overall rates of PFE 
or death.
Email inquiries were sent to the International 
Association of Coroners and Medical Examiners (www.
theiacme.com) and The National Association of Medical 
Examiners (www.thename.org) for autopsy reports con-
sistent with fatal PFEs resulting from gluteal fat grafting. 
Confidential surgeon interviews were performed by Task 
Force members of self-reported and anecdotally identi-
fied surgeons with known fatal PFEs as well as of cor-
oners with identified cases from 2011 onwards. A data 
request was made to the American Association for the 
Accreditation of Ambulatory Surgical Facilities (AAAASF) 
for all cases over the previous 24 months of a fatal PFE as 
a result of gluteal fat grafting. Additional inquiries were 
made to several medical malpractice carriers, state medical 
boards, and other outpatient surgical accreditation organi-
zations. These other entities did not provide information 
citing either that the data had not been collected, the data 
were not indexed or in a searchable format, that the data 
were proprietary, or that they were unavailable for some 
other reason. CosmetAssure (Birmingham, AL), a surgical

complications insurance corporation was queried about 
any known PFEs amongst insured patients.
RESULTS
Six hundred and ninety-two (692) responses were received 
from the 4843 email surveys sent to members of ISAPS 
and ASAPS (14.3% response rate). Of these responses, 612 
surgeons (88.4% of respondents) reported at least one glu-
teal fat grafting procedure performed over a career for a 
total of 198,857 cases. The Task Force elected to exclude 
two surgeons whose unusually high outlier responses 
were most likely due to an erroneous entry while complet-
ing the survey. Thirty-two fatal PFEs were reported for a 
career mortality rate of 1:6214 cases of gluteal fat grafting. 
One hundred and three nonfatal PFEs were reported for a 
career PFE rate of 1:1931. The calculated total rate of hav-
ing either a fatal or a nonfatal PFE over a career is there-
fore 1:1473. Over the previous 12 months, 574 surgeons 
reported performing 17,519 cases. Five fatal PFEs were 
reported over this period for an annual mortality rate of 
1:3448 and 12 nonfatal PFEs were reported for an annual 
PFE rate of 1:1449. The calculated total rate of both fatal 
and nonfatal PFEs in the last year is therefore 1:1030 cases.
Three percent (3%) of respondents to the survey (18 
individuals) who reported at least one gluteal fat grafting 
procedure experienced a patient fatality over their career. 
Seven percent of respondents reporting at least one case 
(43 individuals) experienced a patient with nonfatal PFE 
over their career. The mean number of buttock fat grafting 
surgeries performed by a surgeon reporting a death over 
his or her career was 605. The mean number of buttock 
fat grafting surgeries performed per surgeon never having 
a patient fatality was 283. No association was identified 
between surgeon experience and PFE. The geographic 
practice location of respondents is provided in Table 1. 
More than half of all respondents reported having done 
fewer than 50 cases over their careers and 8% of respon-
dents (49 individuals) reported having performed over 
1000 cases (Figure 1).
Surgeons were asked into which of the three planes 
(subcutaneous, mid to superficial muscle, and deep mus-
cle) they typically injected fat. Respondents could indicate 
any or all of the three options. The reported plane of injec-
tion was found to be highly statistically correlated with 
both fatal and nonfatal PFEs. On multivariate analysis, the 
adjusted IRR for deep muscle injection was found to be 4.03 
(P < 0.0001) for fatal PFE and 6.15 (P < 0.0001) for nonfa-
tal PFEs. Angling of the cannula tip downwards during fat 
grafting was also found to be highly statistically correlated 
with fatal (IRR, 3.90; P < 0.0001) and nonfatal PFEs (IRR, 
3.70; P < 0.0001). Large fat grafting cannulae over 4.1 mm 
were found to reduce both fatal (IRR, 0.2; P < 0.0002) and 
nonfatal PFEs (IRR, 0.14; P < 0.0001). Multiple hole can-
nulae (as opposed to single hole cannulae) were found to 
increase the risk of both fatal (IRR, 2.46; P < 0.0001) and 
nonfatal PFEs (IRR, 2.41; P = 0.003) (Tables 2 and 3).
Confidential Task Force interviews were conducted with 
surgeons identified anecdotally or self-reported to have 
had fatal PFEs. In association with surgeon interviews, 
autopsy reports and coroner interviews confirmed a total 
number of 25 unique cases over a 5 year and 9 month 
period from 2011 to September 2016 (Table 4). Through a 
public records request from the Medical Examiners offices 
in South Florida, seven deaths were identified. The Los 
Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner confirmed five 
deaths during the study period including three deaths in 
2016. ASAPS procedural statistics from 2011 to 2015 estimate 
the total number of gluteal fat grafting cases performed 
by board certified plastic surgeons, facial plastic surgeons, 
and dermatologists to be 65,068 over a 5-year period with

a margin of error of 30%.1,10-13 Based upon the impression 
of Task Force members in their own communities, it was 
estimated that an additional 25% of cases were performed 
by noncore physicians not accounted for in ASAPS pro-
cedural statistics for a total of roughly 100,000 cases over 
this 5¾ year time frame. This suggests that the mortality 
rate may have been 1:4000 from 2011 to the present. The 
AAAASF data for the period of 2014 to 2015 showed that 
there were four reported fatal PFEs arising from gluteal 
fat grafting procedures.14 It is estimated that 25% of all 
aesthetic procedures are performed in AAAASF facilities 
by core physicians that make up ASAPS procedural statis-
tics making the total number of gluteal fat grafting cases 
performed in AAAASF facilities during this period 9407.15 
Four deaths from PFEs suggests an overall mortality rate 
in AAAASF facilities of 1:2351. AAAASF reports an overall 
mortality rate for all procedures in accredited facilities of 
1:55,000 from 2001 to 2011.16 This closely approximates 
previously published mortality rates of approximately 
1:55,000 in AAAASF facilities.17 AAAASF is the only 
nationally recognized accrediting organization of ambu-
latory surgery that has published statistics and requires 
reporting of all untoward sequelae.18 The highest known 
mortality rate associated with an aesthetic procedure prior 
to this paper was abdominoplasty with a mortality rate of 
1:13,147, nearly all from pulmonary embolisms.19
AAAASF has data on over 732,707 operations with lipo-
suction, many of which had other simultaneous proce-
dures. There were two deaths among the 285,921 cases in 
which the only procedure was liposuction, and the cause(s) 
of death were not specified.20 This paper refers only to 
patients who had a PFE after the initiation of the gluteal fat 
injection portion of the procedure, so it can be concluded 
that it was the injection of fat and not the retrieval that 
contributed to the PFEs in this paper. It is important to dis-
tinguish that the phenomenon of PFE discussed here is a 
completely different problem than fat embolism syndrome, 
which is a systemic inflammatory response that results 
from pulmonary microemboli from a long list of causes, 
the most frequent of which is blunt trauma. It has also 
been reported with liposuction.21,22 But the PFEs reported 
herein were macroscopic and caused catastrophic cardio-
pulmonary events. The Task Force found no descriptions 
of this entity occurring with other aesthetic operations.
CosmetAssure is an insurer of complications following aes-
thetic surgery. From March 2015 to February 2016 they cov-
ered approximately 700 gluteal fat grafting procedures with no 
reported deaths. Within this group, eight major complications 
occurred including one pulmonary embolism, one confirmed 
deep venous thrombosis, and one suspected deep venous 
thrombosis. Six of the eight major complications occurred 
in patients undergoing multiple procedures for an over-
all major complication rate of 1.1%.23 Since CosmetAssure 
covers hospitalization costs, it is possible that a death with-
out hospitalization in one of those cases was not reported.
DISCUSSION
Buttock augmentation using fat grafting techniques is among 
the fastest growing procedures performed in the United States 
with a 280% increase for the 5 year period from 2011 to 2015.1 
The origin of this procedure and its common reference as the 
“Brazilian Butt Lift” is generally attributed to the pioneering

work of Toledo beginning in 1985.24 Recent published and 
anecdotal reports of mortality from pulmonary fat embolism 
have not yielded the incidence of mortality and morbidity 
from this procedure.25 Despite its great significance there is 
no all-inclusive local, state, or federal database for surgical 
deaths or complication and for this reason, multiple metrics 
were used to ascertain the safety of gluteal fat grafting relative 
to other common aesthetic surgical procedures. Recent reports 
in the lay press about how deaths from “superbug” infections 
are not reported in a consistent and searchable manner by 
medical examiner offices underscore the public’s interest in 
better reporting throughout the medical industry.26
Instructions for gluteal fat grafting often include injec-
tions into the deep plane to possibly enhance fat graft 
survival27,28 and the use of needles or small 2 mm can-
nulae for injection of the fat.29,30 Generally low perioper-
ative complication rates have been published with this 
procedure although serious complications including sciatic 
nerve injury have been reported with deep injections of 
fat.31 In 2016 Sinno et al published a comparison of satis-
faction and complications between silicone implants and 
lipoinjection.32 They identified a total of 3567 gluteal aug-
mentation patients in the studies that fulfilled their search 
criteria. They concluded that the rate of complications was 
lower with lipoinjection, although there were deaths in 
their review of gluteal augmentation with fat but not with 
silicone buttock implants. Also in 2016, Conde-Green et al 
published a systemic review of the literature and meta-anal-
ysis, and found 19 articles made up of 17 case studies and 
two retrospective studies for a total of 4105 patients (these 
include the cases in the Sinno review).32 They found that 
46.7% of the articles recommended fat injections into 
both the subcutaneous and intramuscular planes, 26.7% 
into only the intramuscular planes, and 26.7% into the 
subcutaneous or subfascial planes.25 Cárdenas-Camarena

described a fatal PFE in a 2015 case report.4,33 A retrospec-
tive survey of Mexican plastic surgeons and the Colombian 
autopsy registry by Cárdenas-Camarena reported a total 
of 22 deaths from PFEs over a period of 10 and 15 years 
respectively.34 It was hypothesized by these authors that 
macroscopic fat embolization was the result of migra-
tion of large fat particles from the high pressure extravas-
cular space into the low pressure venous system due to 
venous injury. Two patients in their study had undergone 
postmortem examination of the gluteal region; one had a 
complete transection of the superior gluteal vein and the 
other an injury to the inferior gluteal vein (Figure 2). All 
postmortem exams revealed fat within the gluteal muscles. 
It is possible that a vein is cannulated and the injection is 
made directly into it, but it is more probable that extravas-
cular fat follows a pressure gradient through a vessel wall 
injury into the venous system. The volume of fat grafted 
was not found to be associated with PFE in their study and 
the mean amount of fat injected in fatal PFE was 214 cc.

PFE were not studied in our survey and has never been 
found to be associated with this complication. Deep muscle 
injections were discouraged due to the theoretical risks of 
injury to larger venous channels located deep in the mus-
cle. Our study seems to support these recommendations in 
that surgeons who reported injecting into the deep muscle 
experienced higher rates of both fatal and nonfatal PFEs 
with IRRs of greater than 4 and 6, respectively. Some sur-
geons with PFE complications who were interviewed by 
the Task Force were emphatic that they injected only into 
the subcutaneous layer. It is impossible to ever determine 
whether they unknowingly injected deeper since careful 
gluteal dissections were not done or the results are unavail-
able. It is also possible that subcutaneous injections may 
track between a muscle plane or along a vascular pedicle 
deep and into an area of large veins or a venous plexus.
We also found that large and single hole cannulae 
(≥4.1 mm) are highly protective against fatal and nonfatal 
PFEs possibly due to a blunter tip reducing the likelihood 
of injury to vessels, or perhaps a stiffer cannula which 
may make it less likely to bend and follow an uninten-
tionally deeper path. It may also be that larger diameter 
cannulae deposit larger parcels of fat that are less likely to 
enter the circulation.
The superior and inferior gluteal veins that drain into 
the internal iliac system are large caliber vessels that can 
be 4 mm or more as they transit the interface of the gluteus 
maximus and medius towards the iliac wing (Figures 3-7). 
Near the sciatic notch, large caliber veins that are 6 mm 
or larger may appear as venous lakes or varices. These 
delicate veins can be seen to noticeably fill and collapse 
with ventilation during surgical dissection. At the level of 
the gluteal muscle fascia they frequently split into smaller 
tributaries in the subcutaneous tissue.
The three methods in this study to estimate mortality 
spans between 1:2351 (AAAASF data) and 1:6241 (career 
reported mortality rate through the survey). The Task 
Force stresses that none of these estimates be construed 
as the actual rate. Each estimate has significant limitations 
in its methodology. It deserves special emphasis that the 
25 documented US deaths are absolutely unequivocal, 
and it is almost certain that there are additional cases of 
which the Task Force was unaware or could not confirm. 
The Task Force believes that while it is desirable to know 
the exact number in order to track improvements from 
changes in technique, it is nonetheless clear that the rate 
is unacceptably high and the approach to this procedure 
must be improved. Given the tendency for surgeons to 
overestimate the total numbers of cases performed over a 
career and the reluctance to report complications in sur-
vey-based studies, it is possible that the mortality rate is 
higher than the survey suggests. It is interesting to note 
that the mortality rate over the previous 12-month period 
reported in the survey of 1:3448 is closer to data reported 
by AAAASF and from data generated through autopsy 
reports and surgeon and coroner interviews. Furthermore, 
it is nearly certain that the Task Force interviews and cor-
oners’ reports did not capture all deaths over the 5¾ year 
period from 2011 to September 2016, and that the actual 
mortality rate is likely higher than the 1:4000 estimated

using ASAPS procedural statistics and deaths identified 
by the Task Force. Several individuals contacted by the 
Task Force refused to participate with an interview or did 
not respond to emails and phone calls, and those anec-
dotally identified deaths were not counted in the study 
as they could not be confirmed. It is therefore likely that 
the actual mortality rate from PFEs is significantly greater 
than 1:4000 and possibly as high as 1:2351 or more. This 
puts the mortality risk from gluteal lipoinjection possi-
bly 10-20 times greater than the average mortality rate 
for aesthetic surgery procedures in AAAASF facilities of 
1:55,000. And it is possibly three to five times higher than 
the risk from abdominoplasty, which until this paper was 
thought to have the highest risk of any aesthetic proce-
dure at 1:13,5000 in AAAASF facilities.
Even surgeons who have a done a few thousand gluteal 
augmentation procedures are urged to recognize that sta-
tistically speaking they have not done enough procedures 
to know that their own preferred technique will result in a 
lower rate of PFEs than the estimates in this paper.
Interviews with surgeons who have had cases of non-
fatal PFE reveal that this is not a benign complication. 
Many of these patients require prolonged intensive care 
unit stays and suffer from chronic and in some cases per-
manent pulmonary morbidity and incomplete recovery. 
Our study reveals the risk of nonfatal PFEs to be between 
1:1931 (career reported survey response) and 1:1449 (prior 
12 month survey response). These numbers are lower 
than the previously reported incidence of 1:833 by Condé-
Green.25 Our survey is likely limited by the tendency of 
surgeons to overestimate the total numbers of cases per-
formed which would falsely lower the actual incidence of 
this complication and by the retrospective nature of the sur-
vey which relies on surgeon recall of cases and events that 
may have occurred in the distant past. Surgeons reported 
a higher PFE rate in the year prior to the study than over 
their careers; the likely explanation is that surgeons were 
more likely to overestimate their career experience relative 
to what they could credibly report for a single year.
It is unknown whether surgeons actually injected into 
the plane in which they thought they were injecting. For 
instance, intraabdominal injuries have been described as a 
complication of subcutaneous abdominal liposuction and 
there are multiple clearly defined fascial layers beneath that 
level.35 If that can happen with abdominal liposuction then it 
is certainly plausible that it can happen with this procedure. 
It therefore cannot be stressed enough that it is impossible to 
know whether the deaths in the subcutaneous or the midsu-
perficial muscle group were due to injections into those lay-
ers or inadvertent injection into the deep muscle. The only 
way to ultimately resolve this would be careful postmortem 
dissections or perhaps high resolution computerized tomog-
raphy (CT) scans to identify the location of the fat and of the 
entry point(s) into the venous circulation. The survey failed 
to define the difference between deep, mid, and superficial 
muscle injections as there are no precise anatomical delin-
eations of these arbitrarily ascribed injection planes during 
this nonvisualized procedure, leaving it up to respondents to 
each subjectively provide their responses. This terminology 
was used in the questionnaire because these are the com-
mon terms surgeons colloquially use to describe the level of 
injection. Surgeons were asked to report the planes in which 
they “typically” inject but were not asked what they did in 
the specific instances of each death, leading to the possi-
bility that a typical practice was not necessarily representa-
tive of what occurred in the case(s) of death. Furthermore, 
it is not known if surgeons who answered the survey are 
representative of all surgeons who perform gluteal aug-
mentation, whether they answered honestly, or whether 
all nonfatal and fatal PFEs were accurately reported. It is 
not known whether surgeons who had a death were more 
likely to ignore the study or participate in order to inform 
other surgeons. Many important factors including fat har-
vest techniques, volume of fat grafted, the use of pump vs 
syringe or mechanical fat grafting techniques, fat prepara-
tion techniques and the size of fat particles were not eval-
uated by our survey and could be of significant relevance. 
Patient positioning and incision location would profoundly 
affect the possible trajectories a cannula might follow 
and could be very important. Thoroughly investigating 
 
all of these relevant issues in a future survey would substan-
tially lengthen the time to complete the survey and likely 
reduce the already low response rate. And in all likelihood 
there would still be a recall bias and many surgeons may 
not even remember all these details. Given privacy issues 
the survey was designed so that it would be impossible to 
trace any answers back to a surgeon. This means that sur-
geons who had already completed it were sent reminders

and there was no way to be certain they did not fill it out 
a second time. This is a conundrum for which there is no 
clear solution other than to create a registry. Even a reg-
istry would still suffer from the potential of surgeons not 
reporting deaths out of concern for reputation, privacy, and 
legal issues. Routine audits such are done with AAAASF 
reaccreditation visits would likely increase compliance. 
The rate of PFEs is low enough so that tens of thousands 
of patients would need to be enrolled to achieve a statisti-
cally significant outcome, which would take at least a few 
years to achieve meaningful enrollment given the number 
of procedures done annually. There are potentially a great 
number of contributing issues that are as yet unknown, 
and so a great amount of data would need to be captured. 
Despite this daunting prospect, the Task Force encourages 
the plastic surgery societies to consider creating such a reg-
istry. A high-level collaboration should also be developed 
between the plastic surgery societies and coroners’ offices in 
the largest cities. This will bring cases to light that may have 
not been recorded in the registry. Indeed, this relationship 
should be developed whether or not a registry is created. 
The central issue to understand is the exact mechanism of 
death. This relationship may also allow investigation into 
the location of the grafted fat and of the vessel injury. Many 
coroners have CT scanners and it is possible that a thin-cut 
scan would reveal these answers. Or perhaps the patholo-
gists may be willing to allow plastic surgeons to assist in the 
dissection of the buttock region, ideally a surgeon experi-
enced with gluteal perforator flaps.
Even if these recommendations are followed, the data 
still predict there will be deaths because there were deaths 
reported in the survey and in surgeon interviews with 
injection into the subcutaneous level. Perhaps the com-
bination of several of the recommendations will diminish 
the risk of death to near zero, but the survey does not 
provide any data upon which such a conclusion can be 
made. It is unknown whether the rare patient may have 
veins in the subcutaneous tissue or superficial muscle 
of sufficient caliber to allow a catastrophic load of fat to 
embolize. It is not known whether with proper position-
ing and constant vigilance a specific plane can be reliably 
maintained or whether there will inevitably be a rate of 
unintended deeper passes of the cannula into the deep 
muscle. It is also not understood whether superficial injec-
tion might possibly cause distraction injuries to the larger 
and deeper veins or whether superficially injected fat can 
travel along a tissue plane towards that disrupted vessel. 
There are many hundreds or even thousands of cannula 
passes during a typical case, so even the very slightest 
rate of accidental deeper passes could present a significant 
risk. It is impossible to ascertain whether with ideal instru-
mentation, positioning, and constant vigilance unintended 
deeper injections can be eliminated or whether they will 
always occur with some finite frequency.
Although we have identified factors that the question-
naire and a review of anatomy suggests will reduce risk, it 
must be emphasized that it is not statistically valid to use 
those numbers to calculate the rate of PFEs if the recom-
mendations were to be followed. This leads to an important 
question: how will surgeons know whether these recom-
mendations reduce the risk, and if so, what the rate of PFEs 
will be? Without a registry surgeons will have to wait until 
another paper such as this is published, with its inevitable 
deficiencies. And if there is not some postmortem determi-
nation of the location of the fat and of the venous injury it 
will not be known whether the procedure is dangerous in all 
planes or whether there is a risk-free technique.
Surgeons and patients will ask if the procedure is “safe.” 
The Task Force has focused on data and believes that defining 
safety is a philosophical question that should be answered 
by the community of plastic surgeons and patients.
CONCLUSION
Gluteal fat grafting is a popular aesthetic surgical procedure 
with a previously unknown incidence of pulmonary fat 
embolism and mortality. The three methodologies used to 
calculate the risk of death yielded estimates from a low of 
1:6214 to a high of 1:2351. Surgeons answering the survey 
who reported injection of fat into the subcutaneous plane 
and into the superficial to midmuscular plane experienced 
63% and 82% risk reductions respectively of pooled fatal 
and nonfatal PFEs. In contrast, those reporting injections 
into the deep muscular plane experienced a 403% increase 
in the risk of pooled fatal and nonfatal PFEs. It has been 
suggested that gluteal vein injury allows an ingress of the 
injected fat across a pressure gradient. It is strongly recom-
mended that practitioners performing this procedure avoid 
deep muscle injections. Though mid to superficial muscle 
Table 5. Recommendations from the ASERF Task Force on Gluteal Fat 
Grafting
1. Avoid injecting into the deep muscle.
2. Use ≥4.1 mm diameter single hole injection cannula.
3. Avoid downward angulation of the cannula.
4. Position patient and place incisions to create a path that will avoid deep muscle 
injections.
5. Maintain constant 3-dimensional awareness of the cannula tip.
6. Only inject when cannula is in motion.
7. Consider pulmonary fat embolism in unstable intra- and postoperative patients.
8. Review gluteal vascular anatomy.
9. Include the risk of fat embolism and surgical alternatives in the informed consent 
process.

and subcutaneous injections are safer, it is likely that some 
risk remains with them. It is further recommended that 
large bore single-hole cannulae larger than 4.1 mm be used 
for grafting and that the cannula not be directed downward. 
It is possible that there may be protective value in keeping 
the injection cannula in motion while injecting to avoid a 
single large bolus injection into a vessel. PFE should be con-
sidered in a patient experiencing significant hemodynamic 
or pulmonary instability during the intra- and postoperative 
period, and such patents should be immediately transferred 
to a hospital with critical care services. The recommenda-
tions of the Task Force are summarized in Table 5. More 
research is needed to identify techniques that avoid these 
catastrophic complications and may include perioperative 
imaging to identify gluteal vessels in advance of fat injec-
tions, ideal incisional access locations, refined instrumenta-
tion, investigation into fat preparation, and pharmacologic 
venoconstriction. Patients interested in gluteal augmenta-
tion through fat grafting should be made aware of the risk of 
pulmonary fat embolism, techniques that can be employed 
to decrease known risks of mortality and complications 
with this procedure, and alternatives that include silicone 
implant-based gluteal augmentation. Further anatomical, 
clinical, and postmortem studies are needed to confirm 
findings of this limited study and to identify techniques that 
may improve the safety of gluteal fat grafting.
