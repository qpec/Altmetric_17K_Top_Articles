The immune system consists of many specialized cell populations
that communicate with each other to achieve systemic immune
responses. Our analyses of various measured immune cell population
frequencies in healthy humans and their responses to diverse stimuli
show that human immune variation is continuous in nature, rather
than characterized by discrete groups of similar individuals. We show
that the same three key combinations of immune cell population
frequencies can define an individual’s immunotype and predict a di-
verse set of functional responses to cytokine stimulation. We find
that, even though interindividual variations in specific cell population
frequencies can be large, unrelated individuals of younger age have
more homogeneous immunotypes than older individuals. Across age
groups, cytomegalovirus seropositive individuals displayed immuno-
types characteristic of older individuals. The conceptual framework
for defining immunotypes suggested by our results could guide the
development of better therapies that appropriately modulate collec-
tive immunotypes, rather than individual immune components.

I
n the peripheral blood of humans over 100 different immune cell
populations can be distinguished based on the expression of cell
surface and intracellular markers. These cell populations span
various activation and differentiation states within broader classes
of principal immune cell lineages in the adaptive and innate im-
mune systems (1). With recent advances in single-cell measurement
technologies such as high-dimensional flow cytometry and mass
cytometry (2), these different immune cell populations can be si-
multaneously quantified in an individual sample. Leveraging these
developments, recent population studies have profiled the global
immune cell composition in healthy adult humans (3–5) and found
these to be highly stable within an individual over the course of
weeks to months, but highly variable between individuals (3, 6).
Although variations in a few immune cell populations are heritable,
the majority of immune cell population frequencies and functional
responses are largely determined by nonheritable influences in
healthy individuals (4). For example, cohabitation has been shown
to be a strong influence, emphasizing the importance of shared
environmental factors within a household (6). Most of the specific
environmental factors that shape human immune systems have yet
to be determined, but monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs discordant for
human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) seropositivity were more differ-
ent in the majority of immune measurements compared with se-
ronegative twins (4).
Many studies have focused on individual immune cell pop-
ulations, their functional properties, regulatory roles, and clinical
significance. However, a prototypical immune response involves the
coordinated action of multiple cell populations (7, 8), providing both
inhibitory and stimulatory feedback, leading to a balanced response
that fulfills its protective function while preventing immunopathology.
The rules for immune cell interdependence are understood in only
a few cases, but there may be many that are unknown. Many
current therapies target individual cell populations and sometimes
give rise to unexpected side effects, involving completely different
cell populations from the ones directly targeted. For example, a
subgroup of patients treated with the B-cell–depleting antibody
Rituximab, which targets the CD20 antigen expressed on B cells,
developed delayed neutropenia despite the fact that neutrophils do
not express CD20 (9). An understanding of why such complications
occur in selected patients requires a more complete knowledge of
how specific immune cell populations depend on each other, reg-
ulate each other, and affect systemic responses.
The immune system is a complex adaptive system, without any
apparent master regulator. Therefore, all systemic behaviors are
emergent properties dependent upon the collective actions of all
system components. As such, immune responses will be unpre-
dictable until these emergent properties are understood. Fur-
thermore, specific immune cell populations are dependent upon
each other for stimulation and inhibition, and different cell
population frequencies vary widely across healthy individuals.
Therefore, we hypothesized that differences in immune responses
Significance
The human immune system consists of many different white blood
cells that coordinate their actions to fight infections. The balance
between these cell populations is determined by direct interactions
and soluble factors such as cytokines, which serve as messengers
between cells. Understanding how the interactions between cell
populations influence the function of the immune system as a
whole will allow us to better distinguish patients most at risk for
specific infections or immune-mediated diseases and inform vac-
cination strategies. Here, we determine key collective interactions
between white blood cells present in blood samples taken from
healthy individuals. This perspective allows us to predict functional
responses and describe previously unappreciated differences be-
tween age groups and in individuals carrying cytomegalovirus.

 between individuals are influenced by differences in some collec-
tive measures of their frequencies of various immune cell pop-
ulations; i.e., certain combinations of immune cell populations are
determinants of response. In this paper, we test this hypothesis by
analyzing responses to stimuli in cohorts of healthy humans.
We first analyzed immune cell composition data from a total
of 1,575 healthy individuals across multiple cohorts, both
published (6, 10) and previously unpublished (149 individuals)
in addition to our previously published data (4), combined in
Dataset S1. We also took advantage of a set of diverse func-
tional responses measured in 329 individuals from a number of
Stanford cohorts (refs. 4 and 11 and previously unpublished
data, combined in Datasets S2 and S3). Our goal was to define
a small number of collective variables, or specific combinations
of cell populations, variations in which could predict functional
responses. Thus, our results depend on the specific cell pop-
ulations and functional responses measured in this study. As
such, future studies across additional independent cohorts
from different geographical locations measuring the same or
different cell populations and functional responses are needed
to further validate the concept that a few properly chosen
collective variables can predict a person’s immune response to
stimulation. Nonetheless, our current analysis is a proof of
concept that immunology can benefit from a more collective
view of the immune system as a whole.
We identified three key combinations of immune cell fre-
quencies (not individual cell frequencies) that robustly predict
diverse functional responses in healthy individuals. Viewed
from the perspective of how individual humans are different in
terms of key combinations of cell populations, we find that,
rather than separate clusters of individuals sharing immuno-
logical traits, there is a continuum of human immune variation.
This variation is influenced, but not dictated, by age, sex and
HCMV seropositivity. Even though young individuals vary
greatly in their frequencies of individual cell populations, they
are highly similar to each other in terms of these three key
combinations of immune cell frequencies. With age, unrelated
individuals become more heterogeneous when viewed from this
perspective, likely reflecting the diversity of environmental
exposures with time. Our results show that HCMV seroposi-
tivity is associated with a shift in immune phenotype along an
age axis, leading to a phenotype characteristic of older pop-
ulations, irrespective of the actual age of the individual. This
conceptual framework of defining immunotypes using the col-
lective states of many immune system components provides a
sensitive way of describing immune variation and could guide
the development of better immune modulatory therapies in
the future.
Results
Human Cohorts and Measurements. We analyzed human immune
cell frequency data from multiple cohorts, described in further de-
tail in Materials and Methods. These are referred to as the Stanford
cohorts of 398 individuals, 226 MZ and dizygotic (DZ) twins from a
published twin study (4), 23 individuals from a published longitu-
dinal study (11), and 149 previously unpublished subjects (combined
in Dataset S1); the Roederer et al. (10) cohort, consisting of
669 female twins sampled in the United Kingdom; and the Carr
et al. (6) cohort, consisting of 670 nontwin subjects, both men and
women, sampled in Belgium.
All three cohorts measured the frequencies of various immune
cell populations in samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs). In addition, for the Stanford cohort, a diverse set of
functional responses was measured, including 168 signaling re-
sponses to cytokine stimulation in vitro (Dataset S2), as well as
response to vaccination to five influenza strains (Dataset S3), listed
in Materials and Methods. The cell signaling and antibody responses
are referred to as functional responses.
Variation of Immune Cell Composition Across Healthy Individuals Is
Continuous Rather than Discrete. There has been much interest
recently in characterizing immune variation across healthy indi-
viduals over a variety of ages (3–6, 10, 12–15). It is also well
established that healthy individuals respond differently to the same
immunological stimulation. A puzzling example of this is that al-
though most patients receiving certain influenza vaccines mount
robust antibody responses, some otherwise healthy patients fail to
produce a protective response. The reasons for such disparities
are only partially understood (16). Along the same lines, novel
immune-modulatory drugs used for cancer therapy yield variable
and unpredictable responses in different patients (17, 18).
To understand such similarities and differences in immune re-
sponsiveness, a conceptual framework for assessing and studying
interindividual differences in immune cell composition will be
helpful. Using data from the three cohorts, we asked whether a
healthy population formed well-separated clusters of individuals
with similar immune cell composition traits. We analyzed each
dataset separately as differences in the measurement panels pre-
vented us from combining them (Table S1). Principal component
analysis (PCA) (19) was used to project high-dimensional immune
cell compositions onto the two principal components (PCs) that
account for most of the underlying variance in each dataset (Fig.
1A). In each of the three datasets, individuals were spread across a
continuous “cloud” and did not segregate into separate clusters.
We quantified this by performing k-means clustering on the top
PCs for each dataset (Fig. S1). The extent of clustering, when
quantified (by average silhouette coefficient and between-cluster
variance, Fig. S1 B and C), is no higher for the cohorts in this study
compared with randomized “null” datasets (Materials and Methods,
Clustering Methods). Although Fig. 1A shows only the top two PCs,
the analyses in Fig. S1 B and C show lack of clustering using up to
the top 10 PCs (which explain around 70% of total variance; Fig.
S1A). Finally, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (20–22),
a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique that overcomes the
limitation of linearity in PCA, also reveals a similarly continuous
distribution of individuals with respect to their immune cell com-
position (Fig. S1D). Thus, we concluded that there is no evidence

 of clustering of individuals based on their immune cell composition
in any of these datasets. We acknowledge the possibility that dis-
crete clusters were not found simply because the particular cell
populations measured in these studies represent a limited panel.
However, this possibility is unlikely given the number and diversity
of cell populations analyzed, and instead our results suggest that
human immune cell composition variation is continuous rather
than discrete among healthy individuals.
Healthy Individuals with Extreme Values of Specific Cell Types Are Not
Outliers in the Context of Their Collective Immune Cell Composition.
Within these continuously distributed immune cell compositions,
we sought to understand whether individuals with extreme outlier
values of specific immune cell population frequencies are also
outliers when taking the full set of measurements into account. As
three key examples involving both innate and adaptive cells, we
analyzed CD4/CD8 ratios (i.e., the ratio between CD4+ and CD8+
T-cell population frequencies) and monocyte and NK cell fre-
quencies. The CD4/CD8 ratios are commonly studied and have
been related to diverse immunological conditions (23–25), most
notably as a prime indicator of AIDS before the identification of
the virus (26). Normal ratios are believed to be ∼2 and our results
show that CD4/CD8 ratios among healthy individuals varied
broadly, from 0.34 to 16 (Fig. 1B). To our surprise, the outlier
individuals with very high or very low CD4/CD8 ratios were dis-
tributed throughout the cloud of points representing healthy in-
dividuals when viewed in the context of their collective cell
composition (Fig. 1B). In other words, the CD4/CD8 ratio, al-
though exhibiting a large range, did not significantly contribute to
the underlying correlated variation captured by PC1 and PC2. A
similar pattern was found for other well-defined cell populations
such as monocytes, which varied broadly from 0% to 49% of non–
T- and non–B-cell PBMCs, and NK cells, which varied from 0% to
59% of non–T- and non–B-cell PBMCs (Fig. 1B). Despite such
extreme individual values of specific cell population frequencies,
these individuals were not outliers with respect to their global
immune cell composition (Fig. 1B). Fig. S2 corroborates this
finding by overlaying the bottom and top 5% of these three indi-
vidual immune cell frequencies onto the distribution of the top
four PCs individually. We conclude from these findings that indi-
vidual immune cell measurements alone cannot identify individuals
with outlier phenotypes and only by taking the collective state of
their immune cell composition can such individuals be defined.
This has important implications for the definition of immunolog-
ical health and disease risk.

Individual’s Immune Cell Composition. Given that the immune cell
compositions are continuously distributed among healthy indi-
viduals and that the possible combinations of immune cell fre-
quencies in any individual are large, we explored whether the
extent to which an individual’s immune system responds to stimuli
can be adequately predicted by a smaller set of specific combi-
nations of individual immune cell frequencies; each such combi-
nation is a collective variable. In other words, we sought to choose
a small set of collective variables in a way such that individuals
with similar coordinates in the space defined by these collective
variables respond similarly to a particular stimulation. Toward this
end, we used partial least-squares (PLS) regression (27) to cor-
relate the immune cell compositions of individuals in the Stanford
cohort with a large set of measured functional responses, thereby
defining a particular choice of collective variables [termed the
PLS “latent variables” (LVs)]; note that response measurements
were not available for the Roederer and Carr cohorts so this
analysis applies only to the Stanford cohort. The functional re-
sponses analyzed involved three JAK-STAT signaling pathways.
These pathways are prototypic membrane to nucleus path-
ways stimulated by a range of cytokines and growth factors and
regulate growth, survival, differentiation, and pathogen resistance
in the immune system (28). We analyzed the phosphorylation of
STAT1(pY701), STAT3(pY705), and STAT5(pY694) in response
to one of seven different cytokines (IL-2, Il-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-21,
IFN-α, or IFN-γ) in PBMCs in vitro (4, 11). The three responses
were analyzed by intracellular antibody staining and flow cytometry,
allowing for the responses of eight different immune cell pop-
ulations [monocytes, B cells, total CD4+, naive CD4+ (CD45RA+),
memory CD4+ (CD45RA–), total CD8+, naive CD8+ (CD45RA+),
and memory CD8+ (CD45RA–) T cells] to be analyzed sepa-
rately. Also, antibody responses 28 d after a seasonal flu vac-
cination were included as a different form of functional responses
(4). Interindividual differences in such responses have previ-
ously been shown to distinguish differentially regulated immune
systems (29–31).
For each of the 168 responses above, PLS (Materials and
Methods and Dataset S4) was used to find the LVs or the set of
linear combinations of immune cell frequencies that have the
highest covariance with the functional response. Our measure-
ments span a high-dimensional space defined by axes, wherein
each axis represents the frequency of a particular cell population.
The LV signatures for the k-th functional response make up the
columns of the LV matrix, RðkÞ, where the j-th column represents
the direction in this high-dimensional space most correlated with
the portion of the functional response unexplained by the previous
j − 1 LVs. This front loading (ordering of LVs in the order of
explanatory power) means that potentially only a small number of
such directions would have predictive value. Each direction cor-
responding to a LV can be viewed as an axis representing a spe-
cific combination of individual cell frequencies. A particular
person’s coordinates in the low-dimensional space defined by a
small number of combinations of cell populations (or axes) defines
how he or she will respond to the stimulus—i.e., location of an
individual’s cell composition in this lower-dimensional space de-
fines what we term the individual’s immunotype.
We compared the performance of PLS with principal component
regression (PCR), another widely used technique in which the
few important axes are chosen to be the PCs, ordered to explain
the most to least variance within the multidimensional immune
cell compositions across patients. Model performance was mea-
sured using cross-validation to estimate an out-of-sample negative
Spearman correlation between measured and predicted response
(Materials and Methods). Both PLS and PCR models perform sig-
nificantly better than a null model in which response measurements
are permuted across individuals to destroy any relationship between
immune cell composition and response (Fig. 2 A and B). This in-
dicates that the correlations between immune cell composition and
these functional responses are unlikely to occur by chance. Al-
though this is true for all but six signaling responses (Materials and
Methods, PLS Regression), only one of the five flu-vaccine responses
(antibodies to influenza B/Brisbane/60/2008 strain) could be pre-
dicted by PLS/PCR better than by a null model. The 10 responses
with poor PLS fit were removed from further analysis because the
results are not statistically significant. Compared with PCR, the
PLS models achieve lower cross-validation error with fewer LVs, a
result of the “front-loaded” explanatory power in the first LVs. For
a typical functional response, the first LV of PLS accounts for 50%
of the possible explanatory power, whereas the first PC of PCR
accounts for only 20%, requiring approximately nine PCs to reach
the same model performance (Fig. 2A).
Remarkably, the top three most predictive LV signatures were
highly concordant across different functional responses (Fig. 2 C–
E). To quantify this, we calculated the similarities of predictive
signatures as absolute dot products between their respective LV
signatures. According to this metric, more than 64% of response
pairs showed similar LV1–3 signatures (P values < 0.05 compared
with a null distribution of randomly chosen vector pairs on a
34-dimensional hypersphere, Fig. S3). This result suggests that

 similar combinations of immune cell population frequencies are
predictive of functional responses to diverse stimuli, such as IL-2–
induced STAT5 phosphorylation and IFN-α–induced STAT1
phosphorylation. The fact that functional responses to many dif-
ferent stimuli can be predicted from immune cell population fre-
quencies only suggests a previously unappreciated relationship
between immune cell composition and functional competence in a
given individual. Furthermore, the similarities between predictive
signatures suggest that particular collective dependencies between
immune cell populations are especially important in determining
even diverse functional responses spanning multiple pathways and
stimuli. However, not all responses are explained by the same three
LVs, and we decided to study more carefully the responses not
explained by these key combinations of immune cell frequencies.
The Response to Influenza Vaccination Is Predicted by Different
Combinations of Immune Cell Populations Compared with Those That
Predict Responses to Cytokines. In contrast to in vitro stimulation
with one given cytokine, in vivo responses are complex and involve
multiple pathways within several cell populations. One powerful
way of querying such complex responses in humans is offered by
studying immune responses to vaccination. Such responses involve
multiple stimuli and signaling pathways acting in concert in vivo
and synergies between these components that could result in pre-
dictive LVs different from those found to predict responses to
cytokines above. However, responses to vaccination were mea-
sured only in one case for a sufficient number of individuals to
enable statistically meaningful analysis using PLS. This vaccine
response involved the antibody responses to the influenza B/Bris-
bane/60/2008 strain contained in a commercial vaccine (Fluzone;
Sanofi-Pasteur), measured using the hemagglutination inhibition
(HAI) assay (4).
There was no measurable response to this vaccine in 31% of
individuals and the PLS method had much improved explanatory
power when these nonresponders were removed (Fig. S4A).
Hence, our LV description of immune cell composition is pre-
dictive of the degree of response in the event that one does occur,
but not of which patients do not mount an immune response at all.
Importantly, the first three LVs that predict the response to vac-
cination are distinct from those that are predictive of the responses
to in vitro stimulation by individual cytokines, in line with our
hypothesis that vaccination elicits a more complex set of stimuli.
This may be why different synergies between immune cell pop-
ulations (different LVs) determine vaccine responsiveness com-
pared with stimulation with a single cytokine. Some of these
synergies are well known in the field, such as the requirement for
T-cell “help” to enable most antibody responses, but there may be
many other dependencies revealed here that have been less well
characterized previously.
To further explore why 30% of the cytokine-signaling responses
were not predicted by the LVs that predicted the responses to all
other responses to cytokine stimulation (Fig. 2), we clustered the
similarity matrix (SI Materials and Methods, Spectral Clustering)
within the first LV for all of the cytokine responses (Fig. S4B). This
analysis revealed two clusters of responses (Dataset S5), the larger
of which (“group 1”) contained 123 responses and the smaller of
which (“group 2”) contained 43 responses. The response magni-
tudes in these groups were very different (Fig. S4C); specifically,
the 43 responses in group 2 involved signaling responses of very
low dynamic ranges, i.e., weak to no induction of phospho-STAT1,
-3, or -5 in response to stimulation. In contrast, the 123 responses
in group 1 showed stronger amplitudes and variation across these
responses was predicted quantitatively by the same LVs. We again
conclude from this observation that immune cell composition is
predictive of the relative strength of a functional response upon
stimulation.
Our findings are summarized in Fig. 3, which compares the LVs
of the vaccination response to a selection of representative sig-
naling responses from group 1. This representation highlights
shared cell populations across predictive signatures, suggesting that
these populations have larger weight in the specific combinations
of immune cell populations that define the LVs for response to

 cytokine stimulation or vaccination. For cytokine stimulation,
12 subtypes tend to have the largest weights, most of which have
the same sign across responses—a positive (negative) sign indicates
that a high (low) frequency of that cell population is associated
with strong functional responses. This is in contrast with the sig-
nature for the vaccination responses, in which a different immune
cell signature was found with a different combination of immune
cell populations being predictive of strong vaccine responsiveness.
Immunotypes Become More Heterogeneous with Age. The immuno-
types of individuals can be visualized by projecting individuals onto
the space defined by the top three LVs. Analyzing the distribution
of individuals within this space can help us better understand hu-
man immune variation. The individuals studied correspond to a
cloud of points distributed in a roughly conical shape. Younger
individuals concentrate near the vertex of the cone and older in-
dividuals are distributed toward the base of the cone (Fig. 4A).
Thus, older populations exhibit greater heterogeneity in their
immunotypes than younger individuals.
The conical shape of the point cloud, and differences in
immunotypes across populations of differing ages, can be quanti-
fied by graphing distributions of interpatient distances (defined as
Euclidean distance on the top three LVs) in different age groups
(Fig. 4B), revealing that the youngest 10% of individuals have a
much narrower distribution than the older patients. Thus, an older
person’s immune response is not predicted very well by age, but
rather by the individual’s immunotype. Young people are similar
enough in their immunotypes for their immune responses to be
better predicted by age alone. Furthermore, the diversification
appears to be quite rapid, where distributions of interprofile dis-
tance for the youngest 20% and 60% (age <21 y and <43 y, re-
spectively) quickly approach the overall distribution (Fig. 4B). One
interpretation of this is that fewer significant new environmental
exposures with an influence on immune variation are encountered
after the mid-40s.
This result is consistent with a previous study in which immune
cell frequencies were found to be more similar between younger
(<20 y) than older (>60 y) monozygotic twins, presumably as a
consequence of cumulative environmental influences occurring
during the decades in between 20–60 y of age (4). However, it is
important to emphasize that the distributions shown in Fig. 4B
were calculated after excluding MZ or DZ twin pairs, as such pairs
are expected to share many determinants of their immunotypes.
Our findings thus show that all young individuals, and not just MZ
twins, are more similar to one another than older individuals are,
presumably as a consequence of the diverse cumulative influences
shaping an individual’s immune system over time.
The contributions of individual immune cell populations to the
age-related changes (Fig. 4C) reveal an expected shift from naive
to memory cells within adaptive lymphocyte populations, but also a
lesser-known increase in CD161+ CD4+ T cells and NKT cells with
age. In contrast, monocyte frequencies are stable throughout life
(Fig. 4C). Finally, because the heterogeneity is observed specifi-
cally in the top LVs predictive of diverse immune system re-
sponses, it indicates that the diversification of immune cell
composition with age in response to environmental influences
has important effects on the functional responses elicited by an
aging human immune system.
Collective Predictors of Immune Responses Are Shaped by Heritable
and Nonheritable Influences. Brodin et al. (4) found that the ma-
jority of immune cell frequencies were determined by nonheritable
influences. However, in defining a small set of combinations of
immune cell measurements that predict functional responses, one

Predictive signatures for diverse signaling responses are uniform across responses but distinct from that for vaccination by a single strain of influenza.
Signatures show the top LV from group 1 responses (see text), averaged over responding cell type (top 10 rows), contrasted with that for the single flu-vaccination
response (antibodies to influenza B/Brisbane/60/2008 strain; bottom row). Each solid circle represents the contribution of a particular immune cell population in
the top LV that is predictive of functional response. Circle area is proportional to magnitude of the average LV1 signature coefficient, with positive or negative
sign indicated by orange or purple, respectively (Fig. S4 and Dataset S5).

 confounds potentially heritable and nonheritable influences that
shape these immunological parameters. Together with the as-
sumption that twin pairs share many of the same environmental
influences, at least early in life, we expect twin pairs to have more
similar immunotypes than randomly selected pairs of individuals.
Indeed, both MZ and DZ twin pairs have lower interindividual
distances (Euclidean distance between immunotypes) compared
with randomly chosen pairs of individuals in our cohort (Fig. 5);
the random pairs of individuals were chosen with an age distri-
bution comparable to the twin pair age distribution. The in-
terindividual distances were lower in MZ twins than in DZ twins,
illustrating the influence of both heritable and nonheritable factors
for determining immunotypes (Fig. 5). This result confirms pre-
vious results and, importantly, also illustrates that the immunotypes
we have defined on the basis of immune cell composition and
functional responses provide an accurate representation of in-
terindividual immune variation.
HCMV Seropositivity Is Associated with a Shift Toward an Older
Immunotype Across All Age Groups. Given the dominance of non-
heritable factors in shaping human immune systems, investigating
the specific factors of importance and how they influence immu-
notypes is important. HCMV is known to affect the majority of
immune system components (4). To this end, we reasoned that it
would be interesting to compare the immunotypes of HCMV-
seropositive and HCMV-seronegative individuals. Graphs analo-
gous to Fig. 4A for HCMV serostatus (Fig. S5B) do not reveal any
clear separation of individuals based on immune cell composition
alone. In fact, if the LVs are used to correlate HCMV serostatus
(using cross-validated logistic regression), many more LVs are re-
quired than those needed to describe the effects of aging (using
cross-validated ridge regression), as shown in Fig. S5C. Fig. S5D
indicates that the metadata alone (age, gender, HCMV serostatus)
are insufficient to accurately predict these functional responses,
and adding them to the immune cell composition data does not
improve model performance, suggesting that the information
provided by the metadata is less predictive than the immunotypes
we have defined. This is best exemplified by the great heterogeneity
seen in older individuals (Fig. 4A), whose responses can be pre-
dicted by a person’s immunotype, but not by age.
Several studies have suggested that HCMV may promote
accelerated immunological aging, and it has been implicated as a
driver of the immunosenescence in the elderly that is associated
with an increase in all-cause mortality (32). HCMV serostatus has
not been found to influence influenza vaccine responses in the
elderly (32–36), but in young adults and mice, HCMV and mouse
CMV (MCMV), respectively, enhance influenza immunity (33).
To test whether HCMV seropositivity was reflected by a change in
immunotype, we projected each individual’s cell composition onto
the line within the space defined by the top three LVs that best
correlates with age (Fig. 4A). This line represents an “age axis”
in this space. The distributions of individual cell compositions
along this line are graphed in Fig. 6A (grouped by actual age and
HCMV serostatus). Fig. 6A shows that across all age groups, the
distribution of HCMV seropositive individuals is shifted upward
along the age axis. Because this association is true for individuals
with the same actual age, we conclude that HCMV seropositivity
does induce a shift in immunotypes toward one associated with
older individuals. The study of individuals of similar age elimi-
nated the confounding effect of older individuals having a greater
chance of exposure to the virus and more rounds of viral reac-
tivation. This finding is important in relation to the ongoing dis-
cussion about the role of HCMV during immunosenescence (36)
and suggestive of a much broader role for HCMV, visible also in
individuals as young as adolescents when viewed from the per-
spective of their immunotypes.

 Discussion
Here we present a conceptual framework for analyzing human
immune systems in terms of “immunotypes” within a space defined
by axes that represent key combinations of immune cell frequen-
cies. First, we find that individuals’ immunotypes are distributed
continuously across several healthy populations and are predictive
of diverse functional immune responses as shown by in vitro cell
signaling results, and these responses cannot be predicted from
individual immune cell frequency measurements alone. Next, we
show that specific factors, most notably age and HCMV serostatus,
are associated with reproducible shifts in immunotype across un-
related, healthy individuals (shown schematically in Fig. 6B).
Furthermore, by analyzing the distribution of individuals’ immu-
notypes, we show that the immune systems of unrelated young
individuals are more similar to each other, whereas older individ-
uals are characterized by heterogeneous immunotypes. Our results
suggest that an individual’s immune cell composition may be
globally modifiable by interventions to transform it from a less
responsive to a more responsive immunotype.
Our findings are in accordance with recent data on the dominant
influence of nonheritable factors in shaping human immune sys-
tems (4–6, 10). They further support previous findings suggesting
that environmental influences exert a cumulative influence over
time, leading to the divergence of immune phenotypes between
MZ twins (4). The finding that collective sets of immune cell fre-
quency measurements predict diverse functional responses is in-
teresting and suggests that the composition of an individual’s
circulating immune system reflects a functional network of cell
populations and that the balance between these cell populations
determines the overall responsiveness of the system. It also suggests
that modulating this balance and perturbing the network, for
example by depleting one specific cell type, can have broad impli-
cations for the functional responsiveness of all remaining cells.
This is an important observation given that such depleting strategies
are routine practice in current medical practice. An example of
a manifestation of this hypothesis is the clinical observation of
delayed loss of neutrophils upon depletion of CD20-expressing B
cells by an anti-CD20 antibody (Rituximab) (37). Another impor-
tant implication of this is that the infusion of specific cell pop-
ulations, such as tumor-specific lymphocytes or populations of stem
cells infused for a range of clinical conditions, could impact the
global network of immune cell populations with unpredictable
consequences for the immune competence of the individual patient.
The relationship between immune cell measurements and
metadata—age, gender, and HCMV serostatus—also adds to our
understanding of human immune system variation. The fact that
these metadata alone cannot accurately predict functional re-
sponses shows the need for collective indicators of immune health
(immunotypes) such as those defined in Fig. 2 C–E. Second, a
description of an aging immune system requires far fewer LVs
than does gender or HCMV serostatus, suggesting that these
characteristics of an individual play a more complex role in reg-
ulating the immune system. The fact that older individuals are
increasingly heterogeneous with respect to their immunotypes also
makes age insufficient as a predictor of immune responsiveness.
Despite the potential our conceptual framework has to pose and
answer important questions in immunology, it is necessary to ad-
dress possible improvements in our results and methods that can
be addressed in future work. First, we emphasize that PLS re-
gression is only one method for choosing the collective variables
with which to define immunotypes. Extending this method using
kernels to account for nonlinear interactions between immune
parameters, in addition to introducing regularization into the LV
decomposition (with a sufficiently large cohort size to allow

their lifetime. The arrow from the disease-associated to the “healthy” region of immunospace represents the potential for the proposed immunotype framework
to guide the development of novel therapies that modulate immunotypes in a desired direction (Fig. S5).

 unbiased fitting and evaluation of the regularization parameter),
would likely lead to more robust definitions of immunotypes. Next,
we acknowledge that predictions of our functional immune re-
sponses from immunotype, although statistically significant, are
moderate correlations. This is likely due to a number of reasons,
the most prominent being that the 34 immune cell populations
(which are restricted to peripheral blood subsets) do not afford a
complete definition of immunotypes, and thus we cannot expect
perfect predictions. However, more extensive immune system
measurements (serum cytokines, chemokines and growth factors,
antibodies, including information from additional tissue compart-
ments, etc.), as well as taking other factors, such as the symbiotic
microbiota into account, may lead to even more reliable definitions
of an individual’s immunotype. Related to this, an expansion of
immune measurements would also increase the potential for front
loading of explanatory power into the top three LVs, covering a
comparatively larger fraction of the global immune system varia-
tion in humans.
It is also important to note that our finding of a continuous
distribution of immunotypes may also be sensitive to the specific
immune cell populations measured in this study. An expansion of
the immune measurements, as described above, could potentially
reveal discrete clustering of individuals, especially if the additional
immune parameters themselves exhibit discrete distributions. In
addition, it is always the case that in clustering analysis, finding no
evidence of discrete clusters does not prove their absence, al-
though we are confident given our thorough analysis that discrete
clusters are not present in these datasets. However, we also predict
that this result could change if our cohorts were expanded to in-
clude, in addition to the healthy individuals studied here, individ-
uals with perturbed immunotypes—e.g., patients treated with
immunosuppressive drugs or individuals suffering from primary
and secondary immunodeficiency syndromes with severe infectious
diseases susceptibility and autoinflammatory symptoms may form a
distinct cluster. We predict that these individuals may be qualita-
tively much different from the healthy individuals in the cohorts we
studied, the discovery of which would be a next step for develop-
ment of immune-modulatory therapies.
A possible criticism of the results we present here is that re-
sponses to cytokine stimulation in vitro may not be reflective of
actual immune system competence that determines an individual’s
risk of immune-mediated disease or severe infectious diseases.
However, several lines of evidence suggest that the broadly dif-
ferent signaling responses, mediated via different signaling path-
ways, are reliable correlates of global immune competence. For
example, in a recent study, Shen-Orr et al. (11) found that de-
fective responsiveness in the JAK-STAT pathway to the same type
of in vitro stimuli was strongly predictive of cardiovascular disease
in a cohort of elderly individuals.
It will be important to test the concepts revealed by studying the
cohorts considered in this paper by carrying out similar analyses in
additional cohorts for which both immune cell compositions (or
other markers) and responses to stimuli have been measured. We
anticipate that the concept of continuous immunotypes predictive
of immune responses will be further validated. The precise defi-
nitions of the key combinations of cell types (LVs) that define
immunotypes may be cohort dependent. Indeed, it will be in-
teresting to study how the precise definition of the LVs depends
upon diet, infection history, etc., by studying cohorts of different
geographical and environmental contexts whose experiences in this
regard are expected to be distinct from those of the Stanford co-
horts described here. Finally, the conceptual framework we have
described should be augmented by a mechanistic understanding of
why and how a few specific combinations of immune cell pop-
ulations define an individual’s immunotype.
By addressing the above limitations in our method, we believe
that our findings and the framework presented here could guide
future developments of better immunomodulatory therapies de-
signed to induce perturbations of an individual’s immunotype
rather than individual immune components (Fig. 6B). This
framework could also be of particular importance for the devel-
opment of improved vaccines in the future, taking immunotypes
into account, perhaps personalizing adjuvants and vaccine formu-
lations as well as optimizing the time for vaccination to improve
responsiveness. Also within the field of cancer immunotherapy, the
induction of antitumor immune responses could be improved by
stimulating immunotypes rather than individual cells to improve
responsiveness. As more data become available and immunotype
definitions become more robust, modeling of necessary perturba-
tions to elicit a desired response would become possible. We en-
vision that such a framework would make the responsiveness of
individual patients to such therapies more predictable because
compensatory relationships between individual cell populations are
taken into account in a way in which more traditional analyses,
focusing on individual cell populations only, do not. Thus, the
conceptual framework we have described may have important
implications for predicting immunological health and the risk
of disease.
Materials and Methods
Cohorts. In this work, we analyzed human immune cell frequency data from
three cohorts. The Stanford cohort consisted of 398 individuals, both men and
women, between ages 8 y and 89 y of age, sampled at the Stanford University
clinical trials unit. The study protocol was approved by the Stanford University
Administrative Panels on Human Subjects in Medical Research, and written
informed consent was obtained from all participants. A total of 226 of these
individuals were twin subjects from both MZ and DZ pairs from the Twin Re-
search Registry at SRI International as previously described (4). A total of
23 additional subjects were included from a longitudinal study of aging in the
immune system (11) and 149 previously unpublished subjects were included as
well (combined in Datasets S1–S3). All demographic information of the subjects
in the Stanford cohort is available in Dataset S1. The Stanford cohort comprises
individuals from the following ClinicalTrials.gov study IDs: NCT01827462,
NCT03020498, NCT03022396, NCT03022422, and NCT03022435. The Roederer
et al. (10) cohort consists of 669 female twins sampled in the United Kingdom.
The Carr et al. (6) cohort consists of 670 nontwin subjects, both men and
women sampled in Belgium.
Immune Cell Population Frequency Measurements. All three cohorts analyzed
PBMCs, using either flow cytometry or mass cytometry. The immune cell
composition data for the Stanford cohort were generated by the Human Im-
mune Monitoring Center, using mass cytometry and antibody panels (4, 11). All
cells were classified by manual gating, using the FlowJo Software (ThreeStar
Inc.), and gating schemes are presented in the original publications. The PBMCs
from the Roederer et al. (10) and Carr et al. (6) cohorts were analyzed by a
combination of consecutive flow cytometry panels and manual gating.
Functional Response Measurements. Frozen PBMCs were thawed and stimu-
lated, with one of seven different cytokines (IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-21, IFN-α,
or IFN-γ) for 30 min; fixed; and stained with antibodies to surface antigens
(identifying eight responding cell populations: monocytes, B cells, CD4+,
CD4+CD45RA+, CD4+CD45RA–, CD8+, CD8+CD45RA+, and CD8+CD45RA– T cells)
as well as intracellular phosphor-STAT1, -3, and -5, respectively, as described in
detail previously (4). The 90th percentile fluorescence intensity of stimulated
samples was compared with the 90th percentile in PBS-treated cells (unstimu-
lated) as a fold-change ratio used for downstream analyses (Dataset S2). In
addition to the cell-signaling responses, we also include an analysis of antibody
responses to seasonal flu vaccines (years 2010–2012) (Dataset S3). The vaccine
administered was the Fluzone quadrivalent vaccine (Sanofi-Pasteur Inc.) and the
vaccine-induced antibody responses were measured in a strain-specific manner,
using HAI assays, and fold changes day 28/day 0 were used for analyses as de-
scribed in detail in ref. 4. The flu-vaccine data included eight strains: A/Texas/50/
2012, B/Massachusetts/2/2012, B/Brisbane/60/2008, A/California/07/2009(H1N1),
A/Perth/16/2009(H3N2), A/South Dakota/06/2007(H1N1), A/Uruguay/716/
2007(H3N2), and Wisconsin. The A/Texas/50/2012, B/Massachusetts/2/2012, and
Wisconsin strains were removed due to small sample size (Data Preprocessing).
Data Preprocessing. Of the 136 cell population frequencies measured in the
Stanford cohort, 34 were considered in this study. We removed 89 cell populations
because they were measured in only 10.3%, 29.1%, 39.4%, or 70.8% of the

 398 patients. We also removed the following 13 subtypes because they either are
rare or are the complement in a set of rare cell populations: plasmablasts, HLADR+
NK cells, CD161+CD45RA+ Tregs, CD161+CD45RA− Tregs, CD85j+CD4+ T cells,
HLADR+CD38+CD4+ T cells, HLADR+CD38+CD8+ T cells, HLADR+CD38−CD4+ T cells,
HLADR+CD38−CD8+ T cells, HLADR−CD38+CD4+ T cells, HLADR−CD38+CD8+
T cells, HLADR−CD38−CD4+ T cells, and HLADR−CD38−CD8+ T cells. To remove
measurement dependence on measurement year (2009–2012), we applied the
ComBat algorithm (38), an empirical Bayes method for removing non-
biological experimental variation that has been found to outperform other
batch effect correction methods according to many metrics (39). Patient
398 was removed due to missing batch information, leaving a total of
397 patients studied from the Stanford cohort. A summary of the immune
cell population frequencies and demographics data for the Stanford co-
hort is available in Dataset S1.
Functional responses having fewer than 34 patients (equal to the number of
retained cell populations) were removed from consideration: three influenza
strains (A/Texas/50/2012, B/Massachusetts/2/2012, and Wisconsin), as well as all
21 cytokine stimulation responses measured in the “Non-BT” cell subtype.
Clustering Methods. The Stanford, Roederer et al. (10), and Carr et al. (6) cohorts
included composition measurements of nonidentical immune cell populations
(see Table S1 for a list of cell subtypes in each cohort), thus precluding a
combined clustering analysis of the full dataset. The “monocytes” cell pop-
ulation was removed from the Roederer et al. (10) cohort as it was missing in
7.6% of the 729 patients. Of the remaining 32 populations, 11 had missing data
in at most 1.6% of patients. For the Carr et al. (6) cohort, patients contain-
ing >20% missing measurements were removed, leaving a total of 449 pa-
tients. Cell populations with >10% missing values across patients were
removed from consideration. Of the remaining 32 populations, 5 had missing
data in at most 4% of patients. Missing values in both cohorts were imputed to
the average across all patients.
Clustering analysis was performed on the PC scores (projections of immune
cell composition data onto the eigenvectors of the correlation matrix—this
places all immune cell population frequencies on the same scale). Clustering of
individuals was performed on the top PCs with a k-means clustering algorithm
implemented using the sklearn.cluster.KMeans() class in scikit-learn v0.17 (40),
using interpoint Euclidean distance in PC space. The quality of clusters from
this algorithm was quantified using two metrics:
i) The silhouette coefficient (41) is defined for each data point, i, as
ðbi − aiÞ=maxfai, big in which ai is the average pairwise Euclidean distance
between data point i and all other points within the same cluster as i,
whereas bi is the lowest average pairwise Euclidean distance between data
point i and all data points in any other cluster. The silhouette coefficient
ranges from −1 to 1, with a high value indicating good clustering.
ii) The between-cluster fractional explained variance is defined as the vari-
ance in the data where each point is replaced by the average of the points
in the same cluster, divided by the total variance, Vtot, in the data (equal
to the sum of between-cluster and within-cluster variance, Vb=w and Vw=i,
respectively). More formally, let xi =

PC scores (PCs 1 − d) for patient i and μ = P

xi=N be the mean over all N
patients. Now, let the clustering algorithm assign each patient to one of C
clusters, ci ∈ f1, . . . , Cg, and let Xc be a matrix composed of the subset of
rows of X corresponding to patients assigned to cluster c; i.e., the rows of
Xc are the set fxi∶ci = cg. Finally, let μc =
1TX
#fi∶ci = cg be the cluster average,
where 1 is a vector of ones. Then, the between-cluster fractional explained
variance, Vb=w, frac, is calculated as follows:
Vtot = tr

Because these measures of cluster performance are difficult to interpret alone,
they are compared with a null model formed by the following: (i) For each PC, i,
in the original data, calculate the difference, ai, between the 97.5th and 2.5th
percentiles of the scores of that PC. This gives a robust-to-outliers measure of
the spread in each PC. (ii) Choose a number of PCs, d, to include in the clus-
tering. (iii) Generate a uniform random sample of profiles within the PC space
contained within a d-dimensional ellipsoid with principal axes equal to the
respective differences calculated in i. If xi represents the randomly generated
value for the PC i score, the null model satisfies
X

ðai=2Þ2 < 1.
This null model was chosen because the PC projections appear ellipsoid with
apparent uniform density of points except at the outskirts (although with a
fatter tail than a multivariate Gaussian). Thus, using a uniform density for the
null model is conservative (i.e., it will tend to give a larger number of clusters
than the real data).
These analyses are presented in Fig. S1, along with corresponding t-
distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) plots, implemented using
the sklearn.manifold.TSNE() class in scikit-learn v0.17 (40) with two compo-
nents, perplexity of 30.0, and learning rate of 1,000.0. The t-SNE method for
visualizing high-dimensional data overcomes some of the limitations of the
linear PCA method (20).
PLS Regression. Formally, we sought to develop a set of regression models that
separately predict the values of each functional response, yðkÞ, given the immune
cell compositions, X, of a group of individuals. Here, element yðkÞ
i
of vector yðkÞ
represents the value of response k for individual i, whereas element Xij refers to
the immune cell population frequency j in individual i. Linear models assume that
the responses and predictors are related through the functional form ^
yðkÞ = XβðkÞ,
where the “hat” distinguishes the predicted responses from the experimentally
measured ones, and βðkÞ is the regression vector for functional response k. The
elements of the regression vector are the weights of each cell population that
define a linear combination that best predicts the functional response.
For the regression models, the functional responses were first transformed
using the log-modulus transformation (42) to preserve rank ordering of re-
sponses while minimizing the effect of large outliers. For each functional re-
sponse, PLS (Dataset S4) is used to find a set of linear combinations (termed the
LVs) of cell populations that have the highest covariance with the functional
response. These LV signatures, rðkÞ
j
, are the directions in the space of possible
immune cell compositions that explain a particular functional response, or-
dered from best to least, as columns of the LV matrix RðkÞ. In this way it is
possible that only a small number of such directions need to be identified to
predict functional responses well. The advantages of using PLS are its simplicity,
the avoidance of multicollinearity issues resulting from highly correlated im-
mune cell populations (SI Materials and Methods, Regression Methods), and
the conceptual advantage afforded by grouping cell populations together into
latent variables that collectively explain a response of interest. We compared
the performance of PLS with PCR, in which directions in the space of possible
immune cell compositions are chosen to explain the greatest variance in im-
mune cell composition across patients.
The regression models are evaluated using learning curves of 10-fold cross-
validated (CV) negative Spearman correlation coefficients between observed
and predicted response measurements for both PLS and PCR regression models.
As described in ref. 43, cross-validation estimates out-of-sample model per-
formance for smaller datasets by fitting a model on only a fraction of the
available data and testing predictions on the remaining data left out. We used
a 10-fold cross-validation scheme based on recommendations by Hastie et al.
(43). The dataset is randomly partitioned into 10 groups and a PLS model
separately fitted on each possible combination of 9/10 of those groups. The
predictions on the left-out groups are compared with their experimental
values, using a negative Spearman correlation coefficient. Learning curves are
made by calculating CV error as a function of the number of LVs included in
the model. The default error (when no LVs are used) is a correlation coefficient
of zero. Error bars on learning curves are generally reported as SEs (44).
However, because our measure of error combines errors over the entire
dataset, we report error bars as SD of error calculated over 100 random in-
stantiations of the CV learning curve (corresponding to different random
10-fold partitioning of the dataset).
We wish to verify that the PLS model is fitting meaningful correlations
between both the immune markers and response functions and that improved
model performance is not an artifact of the model-fitting procedure. To address
these concerns, we evaluate the performance of a “null model,” created by
random reassignment of responses across patients. This randomization elimi-
nates the relationship between a patient’s immune cell composition and the
value of the corresponding response, and the model-fitting procedure should
correctly detect that there is no underlying structure to be learned from the
data. We calculate 95% confidence intervals of the null model learning curve,
using 100 instantiations of the null model to summarize how variable the
estimates from the null model are. Responses for which the minimum error
plus error bar come within 0.05% of the 95% confidence interval of the null

 model learning curve are removed from further consideration. Six signaling
responses (IL-6/Mono/STAT5, IL-7/CD4+CD45RA+/STAT1, IL-7/CD4+CD45RA–/STAT1,
IL-7/CD4+/STAT1, IFN-γ/CD8+CD45RA–/pSTAT3, and IFN-γ/CD4+CD45RA+/pSTAT3)
and four of the five flu-vaccine responses [A/California/07/2009(H1N1), A/Perth/16/
2009(H3N2), A/South Dakota/06/2007(H1N1), and A/Uruguay/716/2007(H3N2)]
were so removed.
Finally, to indicate the amount of front loading of explanatory power into
the top LVs, we also report a normalized error defined as follows: If the
minimum observed error for a given functional response in either PLS or PCR is
denoted emin, and the raw model error is denoted e, the normalized error is
defined as enorm = ðe − eminÞ=ð0.0 − eminÞ, where an error of 0.0 indicates a
degenerate model in which the mean of the response measurements is pre-
dicted regardless of an individual’s immune cell composition.
As discussed in the main text, the PLS model for the HAI response to the
influenza B/Brisbane/60/2008 strain was fitted on only the subset of individuals
who had a measurement increase in HAI titer upon vaccination (31% of patients
with a post- to prevaccination HAI titer ratio of 1 were not included in the fit).
Furthermore, the fit benefits from further outlier moderation; seven patients
with log-modulus HAI titer ratios greater than 4.0 (corresponding to HAI titer
ratios >53.6) were adjusted to this 4.0 threshold for further outlier modera-
tion. These seven individuals had HAI titer ratios equal to 64, 80 (for three

individuals was 11.3.
