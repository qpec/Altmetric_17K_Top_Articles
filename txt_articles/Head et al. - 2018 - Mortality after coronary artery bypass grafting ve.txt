ABSTRACT 
48 
Background: Numerous randomized trials have compared coronary artery 
49 
bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for 
50 
patients with multivessel (MVD) or left main (LM) coronary artery disease. No 
51 
studies have been powered to detect a difference in mortality. 
52 
Methods: We performed a collaborative individual patient-data, pooled analysis 
53 
of 11 randomized clinical trials comparing CABG with PCI using stents, in which 
54 
a Heart Team selected patients with estimated clinical equipoise between CABG 
55 
and PCI; ERACI II (n=450), ARTS (n=1205), MASS II (n=408), SoS (n=988), 
56 
SYNTAX (n=1800), PRECOMBAT (n=600), FREEDOM (n=1900), VA CARDS 
57 
(n=198), BEST (n=880), NOBLE (n=1184) and EXCEL (n=1905). Mortality rates 
58 
up to 5 years were estimated using Kaplan-Meier curves, with comparisons 
59 
between PCI and CABG performed in a random-effects Cox proportional hazards 
60 
model stratified by trial. Consistency of treatment effect was explored in 
61 
subgroup analyses according to baseline clinical and anatomical characteristics.   
62 
Findings: A total of 11,518 patients were randomly assigned to PCI (n=5753) or 
63 
CABG (n=5765). Mean SYNTAX score was 26·0 ± 9·5, with 1798 patients (22·1%) 
64 
having a SYNTAX score ≥33. Over a mean follow-up of 3·8 ± 1·4 years, 976 
65 
deaths occurred. Five-year all-cause mortality was 11·2% (539 deaths) after PCI 
66 
and 9·2% (437 deaths) after CABG (HR=1·20, 95% CI 1·06-1·37; P=0·0038). All-
67 
cause mortality was significantly different in patients with MVD (PCI: 11·5% 
68 
versus CABG: 8·9%; HR=1·28, 95% CI 1·09-1·49; P=0·0019) but not in patients 
69 
with LM disease (PCI: 10·7% versus CABG: 10·5%; HR=1·07, 95% CI 0·87-1·33; 
70 
P=0·52). In patients with MVD, mortality was significantly higher with PCI versus 
71 
CABG in diabetics (15·5% versus 10·0%, P=0·0004) but not in non-diabetics 
72 
 3 
 
(8·7% versus 8·0%, P=0·49). Moreover, the difference between PCI and CABG in 
73 
patients with MVD showed a stepwise increase from SYNTAX score 0-22 
74 
(P=0·59) to 23-32 (P=0·0129) to ≥33 (P=0·0094). In patients with LM disease, 
75 
comparable outcomes were not significantly influenced by the presence of 
76 
diabetes or increasing SYNTAX scores. 
77 
Interpretation: In this individual patient-data, pooled analysis of 11 
78 
randomized trials in which a Heart Team selected patients, five-year mortality 
79 
was significantly higher after PCI than CABG in patients with MVD, specifically in 
80 
those with diabetes and higher coronary complexity. There were no significant 
81 
differences in 5-year mortality between PCI and CABG in patients with LM 
82 
disease, regardless of diabetes and SYNTAX score. Longer follow-up is needed to 
83 
better define mortality differences.

INTRODUCTION 
87 
Numerous randomized trials have compared coronary artery bypass grafting 
88 
(CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using either balloon 
89 
angioplasty, bare-metal stents (BMS) or drug-eluting stents (DES) for the treatment 
90 
of multivessel (MVD) or left main (LM) coronary artery disease.1-3 No individual trial 
91 
has convincingly demonstrated a significant difference in all-cause mortality 
92 
between the revascularization strategies. Hlatky and colleagues performed a pooled 
93 
individual patient-data analysis of ten randomized trials including 7812 patients 
94 
who underwent CABG with PCI using balloon angioplasty or BMS and reported five-
95 
year mortality to be 8·4% after CABG and 10·0% after PCI (P=0·12).1 More 
96 
contemporary trials comparing CABG versus PCI using DES have reported similar 
97 
mortality rates. Despite the large number of clinical trials, all were underpowered to 
98 
detect a difference in all-cause mortality. The objective of the present study was to 
99 
overcome this limitation by pooling individual patient-data from all randomized 
100 
trials comparing CABG with PCI using contemporary techniques (e.g. stents for PCI) 
101 
to examine their comparative effects on long-term all-cause mortality in all patients, 
102 
and separately in patients with MVD and LM disease. 
103 
 
104 
METHODS 
105 
Reporting of this individual patient-data, pooled analysis concurs with specific 
106 
PRISMA guidelines.4 This study is not registered and no protocol has been published. 
107 
 
108 
Study Selection and Data Collection 
109 
A literature search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases was 
110 
performed on July 19, 2017 using the following keywords: “coronary artery bypass 
111 
 5 
 
grafting”, “percutaneous coronary intervention”, “stent”, and “random*”. Two 
112 
researchers (SJH and MM) independently identified randomized trials comparing 
113 
CABG and PCI with the following characteristics: (i) patients were randomly 
114 
assigned to undergo CABG or PCI treatment, (ii) patients had multivessel and/or left 
115 
main coronary artery disease, (iii) patients did not present with an acute myocardial 
116 
infarction (MI); (iv) PCI was performed using stents (BMS or DES) and not balloon 
117 
angioplasty, and (v) more than one-year follow-up for all-cause mortality was 
118 
available (Appendix 1). Abstracts from meetings were not considered, nor were 
119 
unpublished trials. Reference lists from potentially relevant literature were checked 
120 
to ensure no studies were missed.  
121 
From the 19 trials that were identified from the literature search, four trials were 
122 
excluded because patients did not have multivessel or LM disease, one trial was 
123 
excluded because only 54% of patients received a stent, and two trials were 
124 
excluded because follow-up was only available up to one year (Appendix 1). 
125 
Principal investigators of the remaining 12 trials were contacted to obtain individual 
126 
patient data for a pooled analysis. One trial was unable to provide the data (n=105),5 
127 
and investigators from the other 11 trials provided data in a standardized 
128 
spreadsheet for the current pooled analysis: ERACI II6, ARTS7, MASS-II8, SoS9, 
129 
SYNTAX10, PRECOMBAT11, FREEDOM12, VA CARDS (Cooperative studies program 
130 
[CSP] study #557)13, BEST14, NOBLE15, and EXCEL16. Data were cross-checked 
131 
against the publication of the primary endpoint and long-term follow-up 
132 
publications. Several minor inconsistencies were resolved by contacting trial 
133 
principal investigators. Baseline and procedural characteristics of individual trials 
134 
are presented in the Appendix 2, with information of missing data for specific 
135 
characteristics. Core laboratory assessed SYNTAX scores were available from 6 trials 
136 
and a total of 8138 patients (CABG: n=4057, PCI: n=4081). 
137 
 6 
 
The quality of individual trials was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool 
138 
for assessing risk of bias.17 All trials were considered to have a high quality 
139 
according to the criteria, despite not being able to blind investigators and patients 
140 
(Appendix 3). 
141 
Local Medical Ethics Committees approved each trial at the time of study execution, 
142 
and all patients provided written informed consent. 
143 
 
144 
Outcomes and Follow-up 
145 
To allow a consistent definition of follow-up time among trials, the duration of 
146 
follow-up was calculated from the procedure. If patients died before the procedure, 
147 
the time from randomization to death was used to calculate the duration of follow-
148 
up. All-cause mortality was the primary endpoint of this study, with analyses 
149 
planned in all patients, and separately in patients with MVD and LM disease. Planned 
150 
analyses were also performed for trials using BMS, all DES, and for first-generation 
151 
DES and newer-generation DES. First-generation DES were paclitaxel-eluting stents 
152 
or sirolimus-eluting stents. Newer-generation DES were everolimus-eluting stents, 
153 
zotarolimus-eluting stents, and biolimus-eluting stents. The VA CARDS trial was 
154 
excluded from the separate analysis of first-generation and newer-generation DES, 
155 
because a mix of first-generation and newer-generation DES was used. We 
156 
furthermore pre-specified subgroup analyses according to the following baseline 
157 
characteristics: sex, age, body mass index, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes 
158 
mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, previous MI, left ventricular ejection fraction, 
159 
and lesion complexity as defined by the SYNTAX score. Post-hoc subgroup analyses 
160 
were performed according to SYNTAX score tertiles in the overall groups of patients 
161 
with or without diabetes. 
162 
In all trials, a Clinical Events Committee (CEC) adjudicated the events.  
163 
 7 
 
 
164 
Statistical Analysis 
165 
All analyses were performed according to intention-to-treat, with patients stratified 
166 
according to the procedure assigned to by randomization. Individual patient 
167 
baseline, procedural, and outcome data were pooled. Continuous variables were 
168 
expressed as mean ± standard deviation and compared using t-tests, and discrete 
169 
data were presented as frequencies and compared using chi-square tests. We pooled 
170 
data from all 11 trials to provide unadjusted Kaplan-Meier estimates of all-cause 
171 
mortality in overall and landmark analyses at 30 days, five years, and between 31 
172 
days and five years. Comparisons between PCI and CABG were performed using Cox 
173 
proportional hazards models stratified by trial, using a gamma frailty term to 
174 
account for heterogeneity between trials. In this model, each trial is considered as an 
175 
individual study and the random-effects model establishes a single hazard ratio 
176 
(HR). Frailties are unobserved factors, distributed as γ random variables with a 
177 
mean of 1 and variance ϑ. Hence, the variance of the frailty terms represents 
178 
heterogeneity in baseline risk among trials. The statistical significance of the 
179 
variance parameter was assessed using the likelihood ratio test. The proportionality 
180 
assumption was tested for the overall analysis and was not violated (P=0·12). 
181 
Nevertheless, visual inspection of the Kaplan-Meier curves suggests a time-
182 
dependent variance in the HR of PCI versus CABG, and therefore time-dependent 
183 
models were also performed. Subgroup analyses according to baseline clinical, 
184 
procedural and anatomical characteristics were performed using the same Cox 
185 
models. A two-sided P<0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance; 
186 
adjusting for multiplicity was not performed. All statistical analyses were performed 
187 
using SPSS software version 21 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) or R software 
188 
version 3.2.4 (Institute for Statistics and Mathematics of WU, Wien, Austria).

Role of Source Funding and Trial Sponsors 
191 
This current study was performed without funding, although individual trials were 
192 
sponsored (see the end of the manuscript). 
193 
A team consisting of three epidemiologists and statisticians (M.M, E.B, and G.P) 
194 
performed the statistical analyses. The decision to submit the manuscript for 
195 
publication was made together by the principal investigators of the individual trials. 
196 
Sponsors of the individual trials were involved with data collection in the individual 
197 
trials, but uninvolved in performance of the analyses, interpretation of the data, or 
198 
drafting of the manuscript.

RESULTS 
201 
Study Population and Procedures 
202 
The 11 trials randomly assigned 11,518 patients to CABG (n=5765) or PCI (n=5753). 
203 
Four trials were performed with BMS (n=3051), four trials with first-generation DES 
204 
(n=4498), and three trials with newer-generation DES (n=3969). PCI was performed 
205 
with BMS in 26·6%, with first-generation DES in 39·2%, and with newer-generation DES 
206 
in 34·2% of patients (Table 1). Data from individual trials are presented in the Appendix 
207 
2, including information on actual treatments performed (Appendix 4). 
208 
Patients had a mean age of 63·6 ± 9·8 years and 23·8% were female (Table 1). Diabetes 
209 
was present in 38·1% of patients, and 12·4% were on insulin treatment. Unstable 
210 
angina was present in 34·4% of patients and 27·7% had a prior MI, although only 1·0% 
211 
had a left ventricular ejection fraction <30%. Three-vessel disease was present in 60·2% 
212 
of patients, and 38·9% had significant LM disease. The mean SYNTAX score was 26·0 ± 
213 
9·5, with 1798 patients (22·1%) having a SYNTAX score ≥33. 
214 
Surgery was performed with a left internal mammary artery in 96·2% of patients, with 
215 
bilateral internal mammary arteries in 18·7%. Procedures were performed off-pump in 
216 
 9 
 
27·5% of patients. In 73·4% of patients DES were used during PCI, with 53·4% of those 
217 
being first-generation DES and 46·6% being newer-generation DES. 
218 
Patients were discharged with aspirin after CABG and PCI in 95·5% and 97·3%, 
219 
respectively, and 44·0% and 95·1% with dual antiplatelet therapy, respectively 
220 
(P<0·0001 for both analyses). Other secondary prevention was also higher at discharge 
221 
after PCI than after CABG (Table 1). 
222 
The mean duration of follow-up was 3·8 ± 1·4 years. 
223 
 
224 
Mortality in all patients 
225 
A total of 976 deaths occurred during follow-up. Five-year all-cause mortality was 
226 
11·2% (539 deaths) after PCI and 9·2% (437 deaths) after CABG (HR=1·20, 95% CI 
227 
1·06-1·37; P=0·0038) (Figure 1; Table 2). At 30-day follow-up, mortality occurred in 76 
228 
patients (1·3%) after PCI and in 78 patients (1·4%) after CABG (HR=0·97, 95% CI 0·71-
229 
1·33; P=0·84). In a landmark analysis, mortality between 31 days and 5 years occurred 
230 
in 463 patients (10·0%) following PCI and in 359 patients (8·0%) following CABG 
231 
(HR=1·26, 95% CI 1·09-1·44; P=0·0009). A time-dependent model showed that the 
232 
hazard of mortality was comparable between PCI and CABG during the first year of 
233 
follow-up (HR=0∙97, 95% CI 0∙80-1∙19; P=0.80), but was in favour of CABG beyond one-
234 
year follow-up (HR=1·39, 95% CI 1·17-1·62; P<0·0001)(Appendix 5). The estimate of 
235 
the frailty parameter for heterogeneity was significant (θ=0·39, P<0·0001). 
236 
Patients randomized in trials in which DES were used were significantly older, had more 
237 
comorbidities, and more complex coronary disease than patients randomized in trials in 
238 
which BMS were used (Table 3). Particularly, in DES versus BMS trials, diabetes was 
239 
present in 45·4% versus 17·8%, respectively, LM disease was present in 52·5% versus 
240 
1·0%, respectively, and three-vessel disease in 70·6% versus 41·9% (P<0·0001 for all). 
241 
Five-year mortality in BMS trials (n=3051) was 8·7% (131 deaths) after PCI and 8·2% 
242 
(125 deaths) after CABG (HR=1·05, 95% CI 0·82-1·34; P=0·72). In DES trials (n=8467), 
243 
 10 
 
5-year mortality was 12·4% (408 deaths) after PCI with DES and 10·0% (312 deaths) 
244 
after CABG (HR=1·27, 95% CI 1·09-1·47; P=0·0022). The interaction for CABG versus 
245 
PCI with BMS or DES was not significant (P for interaction = 0·53). Although there were 
246 
significant differences in clinical and anatomical characteristics between trials using 
247 
first-generation DES and those using newer-generation DES (Table 3), the difference in 
248 
5-year mortality between PCI and CABG was consistent when analyzing the 4300 
249 
patients enrolled in trials using first-generation DES (PCI: 13·2% (254 deaths) versus 
250 
CABG: 11·1% (201 deaths); P=0·0391) and the 3969 patients enrolled in trials using 
251 
newer-generation DES (PCI: 10·3% (136 deaths) versus CABG: 7·9% (106 deaths); 
252 
P=0·0684) (P for interaction = 0·78). 
253 
In subgroup analyses, the difference in mortality was consistent according to most 
254 
baseline characteristics (Figure 2; Table 2). Diabetes was the only baseline 
255 
characteristic for which a significant treatment interaction was present (P for 
256 
interaction = 0·0077). In patients with diabetes there was a higher mortality with PCI 
257 
compared with CABG (15·7% versus 10·7%, respectively; HR=1·44, 95% CI 1·20-1·74; 
258 
P=0·0001), whereas mortality was comparable in patients without diabetes (PCI 8·7% 
259 
versus CABG 8·4%; HR=1·02, 95% CI 0·86-1·21; P=0·81) (Figures 2 and 3B). Of note, 
260 
although the interaction was not significant, the mortality benefit of CABG over PCI 
261 
tended to be progressively greater with increasing SYNTAX scores (Table 2). Similar 
262 
trends were found in subgroups of patients with or without diabetes (Appendix 6). 
263 
 
264 
Multivessel disease 
265 
Among patients with multivessel disease randomized to PCI (n=3520) versus CABG 
266 
(n=3520), there were 644 deaths during a mean of 4·1 ± 1·4 years follow-up. The 5-year 
267 
rate of all-cause mortality was higher after PCI: 11·5% (365 deaths) versus 8·9% (279 
268 
deaths) after CABG (HR=1·28, 95% CI 1·09-1·49; P=0·0019) (Figure 3D; Table 2). 
269 
Results of time-dependent models are provided in the Appendix 5; similar as for the 
270 
 11 
 
overall patient cohort, the benefit of CABG in MVD was particularly present with longer 
271 
follow-up. 
272 
In patients with multivessel disease, mortality was 15·5% after PCI versus 10·0% after 
273 
CABG, in the 3266 patients with diabetes (HR=1·48, 95% CI 1·19-1·84; P=0·0004), and 
274 
8·7% after PCI versus 8·0% after CABG, in the 3774 patients without diabetes (HR=1·08, 
275 
95% 0·86-1·36; P=0·49) (P for interaction = 0·0453) (Table 2). 
276 
The mortality benefit of CABG over PCI was greater with increasing SYNTAX scores in 
277 
patients with multivessel disease. The respective mortality rates after PCI and CABG 
278 
were 10·5% versus 8·4% in 1381 patients with a SYNTAX score of 0-22 (HR=1·11, 95% 
279 
CI 0·77-1·62, P=0·57), 14·0% versus 9·5% in 1599 patients with a SYNTAX score of 23-
280 
32 (HR=1·50, 95% CI 1·09-2·08; P=0·0129), and 19·2% versus 11·2% in 820 patients 
281 
with a SYNTAX score of ≥33 (HR=1·70, 95% CI 1·13-2·55; P=0·0094) (P for interaction = 
282 
0·32) (Table 2). 
283 
 
284 
Left main disease 
285 
Among patients with LM disease randomized to PCI (n=2233) versus CABG (n=2245), 
286 
there were 322 deaths during a mean of 3·4 ± 1·4 years follow-up. The 5-year rate of all-
287 
cause mortality was comparable with 10·7% (174 deaths) after PCI and 10·5% (158 
288 
deaths) after CABG (HR=1·07, 95% CI 0·87-1·33; P=0·52) (Figure 3C; Table 2). Results 
289 
of time-dependent models are provided in the Appendix 5; in contrast to the overall 
290 
cohort and MVD subgroup, the benefit of CABG was not seen with longer follow-up. 
291 
In subgroup analysis according to diabetes in patients with LM disease, there was no 
292 
significant interaction in the treatment effect (P for interaction = 0·13). In 1120 patients 
293 
with diabetes mortality was 16·5% after PCI versus 13·4% after CABG (HR=1·34, 95% 
294 
CI 0·93-1·91; P=0·11) and 8·8% after PCI versus 9·6% after CABG in 3358 patients 
295 
without diabetes (HR=0·94, 95% CI 0·72-1·23; P=0·65) (Table 2). 
296 
 12 
 
Analyses according to SYNTAX score in patients with LM disease revealed that there 
297 
were no differences in mortality among PCI and CABG in any of the groups: 8·1% versus 
298 
8·3% among 1737 patients with a SYNTAX score of 0-22 (HR=0·91, 95% CI 0·60-1·36, 
299 
P=0·64), 10·8% versus 12·7% among 1623 patients with a SYNTAX score of 23-32 
300 
(HR=0·92, 95% CI 0·65-1·30; P=0·65), and 15·0% versus 12·4% among 978 patients 
301 
with a SYNTAX score of ≥33 (HR=1·39, 95% CI 0·94-2·06; P=0·1006) (P for interaction = 
302 
0·38) (Table 2).

304 
DISCUSSION 
305 
This collaborative analysis of individual patient data from 11 randomized trials is the 
306 
first large-scale analysis of data comparing CABG and PCI performed using stents. In a 
307 
total of 11,518 randomly assigned patients, the 5-year mortality rate was significantly 
308 
higher after PCI than after CABG. However, this difference was not consistent among 
309 
subgroups. Specifically, the mortality benefit of CABG over PCI was seen only in patients 
310 
with multivessel disease and diabetes. Conversely, there were no significant differences 
311 
in mortality between CABG and PCI in patients without diabetes who had multivessel 
312 
disease, or in all patients with left main disease (with or without diabetes). Coronary 
313 
lesion complexity was an important effect modifier, particularly in patients with 
314 
multivessel disease. 
315 
The difference between CABG and PCI using stents is a topic of debate that is fueled each 
316 
time stent design is enhanced. Due to these improvements, randomized trials comparing 
317 
CABG and PCI have increasingly included higher-risk patients with more complex 
318 
disease, such as three-vessel or left main disease. This is also reflected in our data 
319 
wherein 5-year all-cause mortality in both the CABG and PCI cohorts was higher in 
320 
contemporary trials with DES versus earlier trials in which BMS were used.  
321 
It is important to acknowledge that in these trials, both an interventional cardiologist 
322 
and a cardiac surgeon had to assume clinical equipoise between PCI and CABG for 
323 
 13 
 
patients to be randomized. Such a Heart Team concept has received more emphasis over 
324 
the recent years to determine the best revascularization strategy for individual 
325 
patients.18 Some patients were not eligible for inclusion in the selected randomized 
326 
trials due to coronary lesion complexity too severe to be treated by PCI or an operative 
327 
risk deemed to high to undergo CABG.19 The results of this analysis therefore do not 
328 
correspond to the entire population of patients with coronary artery disease that 
329 
require revascularization. 
330 
The mortality benefit of CABG versus PCI in the overall group was retained over a 
331 
variety of patient baseline characteristics. However, the presence of diabetes remained 
332 
as an important factor, as demonstrated in previous analyses.1 The benefit of CABG in 
333 
patients with diabetes may be attributed to more effective revascularization of diffuse, 
334 
complex coronary disease. This is consistent with the findings of the subgroup analyses 
335 
according to SYNTAX score. In the total cohort, there was a step-wise increase in the 
336 
difference between CABG and PCI with higher SYNTAX scores. Other studies have 
337 
identified sex as an effect modifier,20 but we were unable to confirm a significant 
338 
treatment-by-sex interaction for 5-year mortality. 
339 
Patients with multivessel disease have lower mortality with CABG, as shown in the 
340 
SYNTAX trial that compared CABG with PCI with first-generation DES.21,22 The BEST trial 
341 
in which second-generation, everolimus-eluting stents were used to treat multivessel 
342 
disease also found that CABG was associated with lower rates of major adverse cardiac 
343 
or cerebrovascular events, driven by a reduced rate of MI and repeat 
344 
revascularization.14 However, both trials failed to show a survival benefit for either 
345 
treatment. Large real-world registries that applied propensity matching of CABG versus 
346 
PCI with DES for multivessel disease have attempted to find such differences with larger 
347 
sample sizes.23,24 The ASCERT study, the largest such analysis, reported an adjusted 4-
348 
year mortality of 16.4% for CABG and 20.8% for PCI among a cohort of patients aged 65 
349 
years or older, which was consistent in multiple subgroups.24 Notably, a similar pattern 
350 
 14 
 
of the survival curves of CABG versus PCI is observed when comparing those of the real-
351 
world ASCERT study in which patients were treated with first-generation DES and that 
352 
of the current analysis: PCI shows a benefit within the first year of follow-up but with 
353 
longer follow-up there is a larger benefit with CABG. We were able to show that this 
354 
reversal of the hazard resulted in a significant benefit of CABG over PCI at a mean of 4·1 
355 
years, which may potentially become larger with prolonged follow-up as the hazard 
356 
ratio was more in favour of CABG at later follow-up in time-varying models.  
357 
Among patients with LM disease randomized in the SYNTAX trial, comparable 5-year 
358 
mortality between CABG and paclitaxel-eluting, first-generation DES was noted.25 Two 
359 
major trials have since focused on finding the optimal revascularization strategy for LM 
360 
disease and have recently reported conflicting outcomes of CABG versus PCI. The EXCEL 
361 
trial reported non-inferiority of PCI versus CABG after 3 years, while the NOBLE trial did 
362 
not demonstrate non-inferiority of PCI versus CABG at 5 years.15,16 The differences in 
363 
timing and composition of the primary endpoints make a comparison of these trials 
364 
difficult and can presumably explain the apparent difference in results. Three-year 
365 
individual endpoints in the NOBLE trial were later confirmed to be remarkably similar 
366 
to EXCEL.26 In the current pooled analysis of data from 4 different trials, mortality in 
367 
patients with LM disease was similar after CABG and PCI at 5-year follow-up. The 
368 
mortality comparison was consistent in a subgroup analysis according to diabetes, 
369 
unlike the analysis of all patients and those with multivessel disease, although this may 
370 
be due to smaller sample size in the diabetic subgroup of LM patients. Coronary 
371 
complexity by SYNTAX score did not show to impact the mortality comparison, although 
372 
patients with a high SYNTAX score were relatively underrepresented due to specific 
373 
inclusion criteria (e.g. in the EXCEL trial) and a Heart Team preference for CABG.19 
374 
Therefore, the degree of complexity should still be important to consider when 
375 
proposing a specific treatment for individual patients with LM disease. Patients with a 
376 
complex LM lesion and additional three-vessel disease with a high SYNTAX score may 
377 
 15 
 
still benefit from CABG in terms of mortality, as well as MI and repeat revascularization, 
378 
while patients with a non-complex LM lesion and one or two-vessel disease may be 
379 
excellent candidates for PCI. Clinical guidelines have not been revised since the release 
380 
of the EXCEL and NOBLE trial data. Based on the current data of comparable mortality, 
381 
the indication for PCI with contemporary DES may be broadened to patients with more 
382 
complex LM disease (e.g. intermediate SYNTAX scores). However, since only 978 
383 
patients in the present LM cohort had high SYNTAX scores, additional data is required 
384 
before PCI can be routinely recommended in patients with complex LM disease. Longer 
385 
follow-up is essential to better define differences in survival between CABG and PCI, as 
386 
landmark analyses from the EXCEL trial showed that the hazard of mortality after CABG 
387 
and PCI was different according to the period of follow-up and may show a benefit of 
388 
CABG with longer follow-up.16  
389 
The major strength of the current analysis is that we were able to find clinically relevant 
390 
differences in all-cause mortality between CABG and PCI due to the collaboration of the 
391 
principal investigators from 11 high-quality randomized trials, allowing pooled data to 
392 
provide sufficient power to examine an outcome that occurs relatively infrequently. 
393 
Indeed, all-cause mortality is considered to be the most clinically important and least 
394 
biased endpoint, which is another strength of this analysis. Having individual patient 
395 
data also facilitated formation of Kaplan-Meier curves so the temporal relationships of 
396 
mortality could be examined, and analysis of outcomes in important subgroups, which 
397 
in the present study were highly informative.   
398 
Nevertheless, several limitations should also be considered. First, all the included trials 
399 
randomized patients with estimated clinical equipoise between CABG and PCI. These 
400 
trials had specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, and many patients were excluded 
401 
because CABG or PCI was thought to be the preferred revascularization strategy based 
402 
on the age, risk profile, or coronary complexity.19 This resulted in a population with only 
403 
22·1% having a SYNTAX score ≥33. Second, these inclusion and exclusion criteria have 
404 
 16 
 
resulted in significant variance in the baseline characteristics of the patients from 
405 
different trials, as shown by our assessment of frailty. Third, besides mortality, other 
406 
outcome measures that impact morbidity and quality of life, such as MI, stroke, and 
407 
repeat revascularization, are also important for the patient and should be taken into 
408 
account by the Heart Team when deciding on the best revascularization option for each 
409 
individual patient. In the current era of exponentially growing health care costs and the 
410 
need to reduce expenses, the cost-effectiveness of PCI and CABG should furthermore be 
411 
evaluated. Fourth, the mean patient age was 63.6 years, and the mean follow-up was 3·8 
412 
years. Considering the life expectancy of patients, this follow-up is still relatively short 
413 
to determine the full impact of revascularization method on survival, especially 
414 
considering the diverging or converging Kaplan-Meier curves in specific subgroups. 
415 
Fifth, definitions of patient characteristics may have slightly differed between trials, 
416 
which may have impacted the results of the subgroup analyses. Sixth, we were unable to 
417 
include data from the LE MANS trial5, although it is very unlikely that inclusion of these 
418 
105 patients with LM disease would significantly alter the results, and thus the 
419 
outcomes of this study are robust with respect to the available evidence. 
420 
 
421 
CONCLUSIONS 
422 
In this individual patient-data, pooled analysis from 11 trials in which a Heart Team 
423 
randomized 11,518 patients with estimated clinical equipoise between PCI and CABG, 5-
424 
year mortality was significantly lower after CABG as compared with PCI. The benefit 
425 
was demonstrated only in patients with multivessel disease and diabetes, but not in 
426 
patients with multivessel disease without diabetes. Nor was there a benefit of CABG or 
427 
PCI in patients with LM disease. Coronary lesion complexity is an important factor to 
428 
consider when choosing the appropriate revascularization strategy, especially in 
429 
patients with multivessel disease. Longer follow-up is needed to better define mortality 
430 
 17 
 
differences. These results may not be applicable to patients excluded from randomized 
431 
trials for various reasons (e.g. coronary complexity or procedural risk).

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT 
434 
Evidence before this study 
435 
A literature search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases was performed 
436 
on July 19, 2017 to identify randomized clinical trials comparing coronary artery bypass 
437 
grafting and percutaneous coronary intervention with stents using the following 
438 
keywords: “coronary artery bypass grafting”, “percutaneous coronary intervention”, 
439 
“stent”, and “random*”, with the following characteristics: (i) patients had multivessel 
440 
and/or left main coronary artery disease, (ii) patients did not present with an acute 
441 
myocardial infarction (MI); (iii) PCI was performed using stents (BMS or DES) and not 
442 
balloon angioplasty, and (iv) more than one-year follow-up for all-cause mortality was 
443 
available. We identified 12 high-quality trials, none of which found a significant 
444 
difference in all-cause mortality between PCI and CABG at 3-10 year follow-up. Separate 
445 
meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials that included patients with multivessel 
446 
disease or with left main disease showed no significant differences in all-cause mortality 
447 
between PCI and CABG. Meta-analyses did show that patients with diabetes have a 
448 
benefit with CABG over PCI as opposed to patients without diabetes where no difference 
449 
was found, although this has been contradicted in other pooled analyses.  
450 
Added value of this study 
451 
This study is the largest analysis of patients randomly assigned to PCI with stents or 
452 
CABG. It shows for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that all-cause mortality is 
453 
significantly lower with CABG than with PCI in an overall randomized population of 
454 
patients with multivessel or left main disease. However, because of the use of individual 
455 
patient data, important subgroups are identified that have a survival benefit from CABG, 
456 
 18 
 
which are patients with multivessel disease and diabetes, and high coronary lesion 
457 
complexity. Patients with left main disease and lower coronary lesion complexity have 
458 
comparable survival with PCI and CABG. 
459 
Implications of all the available evidence 
460 
Some patients have specific indications for PCI or CABG because of too high coronary 
461 
complexity for PCI or too high operative risk for CABG. In patients with estimated 
462 
clinical equipoise as determined by a Heart Team, it is crucial to consider the presence 
463 
of multivessel or left main disease, the coronary complexity as determined by the 
464 
SYNTAX score, and the presence of diabetes, as these are important effect modifiers in 
465 
terms of PCI versus CABG and should impact the decisions for coronary 
466 
revascularization in daily practice. However, longer follow-up of randomized trials is 
467 
required to better define mortality differences in overall patients and specific 
468 
subgroups.

The assessment of “Random sequence generation” was rated “?” for the ARTS and MASS-II trials because it was not specified exactly how randomization took place. 
The assessment of “Allocation concealment” was rated standard as “-“ for all trials because patients had to be informed on the allocated procedure, since these 
trials evaluate interventional procedures. The assessment of “Blinding of patients and personnel” was rated standard as “-“ for all trials because the two 
interventional procedures evaluated are inherently different and patients cannot be blinded. The assessment of “Blinding of outcome assessment” was rated 
standard as “+” for all trials as no bias can be introduced for the endpoint of all-cause mortality, and thus blinding is irrelevant; yet still a clinical events committee 
reviewed all events. The assessment of “Incomplete outcome data” was “-“ for the SYNTAX trial because >10% of patients after CABG were lost to follow-up, while 
this rate was only 3.5% after PCI. The assessment of “Selective reporting” was rated “+” for all trials because all trials reported all-cause mortality. The assessment 
of “Other bias” was rated as “-“ in the RECOMBAT, VA CARDS, and BEST trials because a relatively high percentage (>10%) of patients did not receive the allocated 
treatment because of cross over or no interventional treatment.

Results of time-dependent models provide a hazard ratio for a first time interval and a second 
interval with the duration of this interval being dependent on when the hazard changes, which 
can be different according to the patient cohort. CI, confidence interval; DM, diabetes mellitus; 
HR, hazard ratio.
