Abstract
Lung cancer (LC) is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths
worldwide. Early LC diagnosis is crucial to reduce the high case
fatality rate of this disease. In this case–control study, we devel-
oped an accurate LC diagnosis test using retrospectively collected
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human lung tissues and
prospectively
collected
exhaled
breath
condensates
(EBCs).
Following international guidelines for diagnostic methods with
clinical application, reproducible standard operating procedures
(SOP) were established for every step comprising our LC diagnosis
method. We analyzed the expression of distinct mRNAs expressed
from GATA6 and NKX2-1, key regulators of lung development. The
Em/Ad expression ratios of GATA6 and NKX2-1 detected in EBCs
were combined using linear kernel support vector machines (SVM)
into the LC score, which can be used for LC detection. LC score-
based diagnosis achieved a high performance in an independent
validation cohort. We propose our method as a non-invasive,
accurate, and low-price option to complement the success of
computed tomography imaging (CT) and chest X-ray (CXR) for LC
diagnosis.

Introduction
Lung cancer patients are mostly asymptomatic at early stages.
Symptoms, even when present, are non-specific and mimic more
common benign etiologies (Hyde & Hyde, 1974). Thus, in the major-
ity of LC patients, traditional diagnostic strategies are initiated at
advanced stages of the disease, when the overall condition of the
patient is already impaired and prognosis is poor, as shown by the
low 5-year patient survival of 1–5% (Herbst et al, 2008). Computed
tomography imaging (CT) detects LC at an earlier stage than chest
X-ray (CXR) (Henschke et al, 1999). Approximately 55–85% of the
CT-detected LC can be surgically removed resulting in an improved
5-year patient survival of almost 52% (The International Early Lung

 Cancer Action Program Investigators, 2006). Furthermore, the
National Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NLST) reported a 20%
decrease in LC mortality in the low-dose CT group (The National
Lung Screening Trial Research Team, 2011). These studies support
that early diagnosis is crucial to reduce the extremely high case fatal-
ity rate of LC (95%) (Ferlay et al, 2015). A better understanding of
the molecular mechanisms involved in tumor initiation is critical to
develop new diagnostic strategies for early LC diagnosis. We
speculated that mechanisms involved in embryonic development are
recapitulated during LC initiation (Borczuk et al, 2003; Liu et al,
2006). Thus, GATA6 (GATA-binding factor 6) and NKX2-1 (NK2
homeobox 1, also known as TTF-1, thyroid transcription factor-1),
two transcription factors that are key regulators of embryonic lung
development (Maeda et al, 2007), were analyzed for their potential as
biomarkers for LC detection. Among other lung development relevant
genes, GATA6 and NKX2-1 were selected due to their similar gene
structure (Fig 1A) and their implication in LC (Winslow et al, 2011;
Cheung et al, 2013). We hypothesized that isoform-specific expres-
sion analysis of GATA6 and NKX2-1 in EBCs can be used for LC diag-
nosis. Further, we established reproducible SOPs for a LC diagnosis
method following international guidelines for diagnostic methods
with clinical application (Bossuyt et al, 2003; McShane et al, 2013).
Results
Study design
A detailed description of the study population can be found in the
Materials and Methods section, Tables 1 and 2. The study popula-
tion consisted of two types of samples, retrospectively collected
FFPE human lung tissue samples and prospectively collected EBCs.
The study population was grouped in three sets according to the
phase of the study in which the samples were analyzed (Fig EV1).
In the first phase, the SOPs for RNA isolation and qRT–PCR analysis
were established using retrospectively collected FFPE human lung
tissue
samples
(n = 112,
Table 1)
collected
in
Germany
and
Mexico. Further, isoform-specific expression analysis of GATA6 and
NKX2-1 was performed on these FFPE samples using the optimized
SOP. In the second phase, the SOP for collection, storage, and
processing of EBCs was optimized. Using this SOP, a training set of
EBCs (n = 113, Table 1) was prospectively collected. Isoform-
specific expression analysis of GATA6 and NKX2-1 was performed
on the training set. Next, a SVM classifier was used to combine the
Em/Ad ratios of GATA6 and NKX2-1 of each sample to create the LC
score. In the third phase, using the SOPs established in phases 1 and
2, an independent set of previously unseen EBCs (validation set,
n = 138, Table 1) was collected from patients continuously enrolled
in the clinic, in a blinded manner, thereby mimicking conditions of
clinical use. Isoform-specific expression analysis of GATA6 and
NKX2-1 was performed on the validation set. The LC score was
externally validated on this set of EBCs.
Expression ratios of Em to Ad isoforms of GATA6 and NKX2-1 as
biomarkers for LC
In silico analysis of GATA6 and NKX2-1 revealed a common gene
structure (Fig 1A, top). Two promoters were predicted in each of
the genes, one 50 of the first exon and the other one in the first
intron. Expression analysis showed that each gene gave rise to two
distinct transcripts (bottom) driven by different promoters. The
structure of the murine orthologues is similar to humans, highlight-
ing an evolutionarily conserved gene structure. Expression analysis
by qRT–PCR during mouse lung development showed that the
expression of both isoforms of the same gene was complementary
and differentially regulated (Fig EV2A), with the embryonic (Em)
isoform mainly expressed during early developmental stages, and
the adult (Ad) isoform expressed at later stages and in the adult
lung. Interestingly, the expression of the Em isoforms of GATA6 and
NKX2-1 was higher than the expression of the Ad isoforms in dif-
ferent LC cell lines when compared to human control lung tissue
(Fig EV2B). We confirmed these results in various mouse models of
LC (Fig EV2C and Appendix Supplementary Results).
To verify that a similar increase in the expression of the Em
isoforms
of
GATA6
and
NKX2-1
occurs
in
LC
patients,
we
performed isoform-specific expression analysis in human lung
tissues from controls and LC patients (Fig 1B). In order to mini-
mize the effect of individual variations among the different LC
specimens and to facilitate comparability between LC and control
samples, we used the expression of the Ad isoform as internal
control for a second level of normalization in addition to the
normalization
using
the
endogenous
reference
gene
TUBA1A
(Mehta et al, 2015a). Thus, we calculated the Em/Ad expression
ratio (Em/Ad) for each sample. In control lung tissue (n = 61), the
median
Em/Ad
was
0.15
for
GATA6
and
0.18
for
NKX2-1
(Table EV1). Interestingly, the median Em/Ad increased in the LC
tissue (n = 51) to 2.25 (P = 4.1E-16) for GATA6 and to 1.62
(P = 3.1E-18) for NKX2-1, consistent with our results in Fig EV2.
The increased Em/Ad expression ratios of GATA6 and NKX2-1 in
the LC samples were maintained after sample grouping by ethnic-
ity or gender (Fig 1C and Table EV1). Further, sample grouping
based on the TNM classification (Sobin et al, 2009) revealed that
the Em/Ad expression ratios increased to 2.23 (P = 4.6E-10) for
GATA6 and 1.67 (P = 6.3E-3) for NKX2-1 at stage I (Fig 1D and
Table EV2), supporting the use of increased Em/Ad of GATA6 and
NKX2-1 as biomarkers for detection of early staged LC.
Detection of Em and Ad isoforms of GATA6 and NKX2-1 in EBC
After confirming that RNA-containing exosomes are enriched in
EBCs of LC patients (Fig EV2D and E, and Appendix Supplementary
Results), we tested whether increased Em/Ad expression ratios of
GATA6 and NKX2-1 can also be detected in EBCs. Thus, we
performed isoform-specific expression analysis by qRT–PCR after
total RNA isolation from EBCs (Fig 2A). The SOPs for EBC collec-
tion,
storage,
and
processing
were
optimized
(Fig EV3
and
Appendix Supplementary Results) and subsequently used for the
collection of a training set of EBCs (n = 113, Table 1). In control
EBCs (n = 65), the median Em/Ad was 0.15 for GATA6 and 0.23
for NKX2-1 (Table EV1). Correlating with our previous results
using lung tissues, the median Em/Ad increased in the EBCs of LC
patients (n = 48) to 1.32 (P = 2.26E-16) for GATA6 and to 1.13
(P = 1.6E-17) for NKX2-1. Hence, our results support that an
increased Em/Ad of GATA6 and NKX2-1 can be also detected in
EBCs from LC patients. The specificity of the different qRT–PCR
products detected in the EBCs was demonstrated by different

The
repeatability
of
isoform-specific expression analysis of GATA6 and NKX2-1 was
confirmed by Bland–Altman plots (Bland & Altman, 1986) after
measurements in two distinct EBCs from the same patient, for five
different patients (Fig EV4B and Appendix Supplementary Results).
To further validate our findings, EBC-based expression analysis
was directly compared with LC tissues of the same patient
(Fig EV4C). The Em/Ad expression ratios of GATA6 and NKX2-1
obtained from both types of samples of the same individuals
showed a strong positive correlation (R² = 0.48 for GATA6 and
0.69 for NKX2-1). Moreover, the classical methods for LC diagno-
sis, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry directly correlated
with the increased Em/Ad of GATA6 and NKX2-1 in all cases that
we tested.

 Development and validation of the LC score as a simple clinical
score for LC diagnosis
Our results demonstrated that the Em/Ad expression ratios of
GATA6 and NKX2-1 in the EBCs of LC patients can be used for LC
detection. Nonetheless, we decided to improve our method by
combining
the
log2-transformed
Em/Ad
expression
ratios
for
GATA6 and NKX2-1 of each sample of the training set of EBCs using
a SVM (Fig 2B). The SVM calculated a robust separating hyperplane
(left), and the distance of each point to this hyperplane is the LC
score. A sample with a LC score greater than zero is classified as a
LC patient (right; Appendix Table S2), while samples with LC score
equal or less than zero are classified as control. To further confirm
the performance of the LC score classifier, we conducted an external
validation (Fig 2C and Appendix Table S3) on an independent set of
EBCs (validation set; n = 138) that was collected from patients
continuously enrolled in the clinic, in a blinded manner. Receiver
operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis (Sing et al, 2005)
confirmed the increase in performance of the LC score-based classi-
fication over a classification relying only on Em/Ad expression
ratios of GATA6 or NKX2-1 (Fig 2D). The area under the curve
(AUC) values were 0.99 (LC score), 0.93 (GATA6), and 0.97 (NKX2-1).
Further performance assessment of the LC score after applying it to
the independent validation set of EBCs showed a sensitivity of
98.3%, and a specificity of 89.7% (Fig 2E and Table EV4).
Cigarette smoking is strongly associated with LC (Mehta et al,
2015b). Thus, we decided to assess whether the LC score reflected
the smoking history of the individuals (Fig 3A). Controls and LC
samples were sorted into three groups: never smokers (NS), previ-
ous smokers (PS), and current smokers (CS). The LC score was
significantly different between Ctrl and LC patients in each of the
smoking history groups (Table EV3). However, we did not find
significant differences between the smoking history groups neither
in the Ctrl nor in the LC group. Further, using the LC score, we were
unable to statistically discriminate between the two major LC types
NSCLC and SCLC (Fig 3B and Table EV2) or different histological
subtypes of NSCLC (ADC, SQCC or LCC). Remarkably, sample
grouping based on TNM classification (Sobin et al, 2009) (Fig 3C
and Table EV2) revealed that the median LC score increased from
�3.66 in the controls to 1.52 (P = 1E-6) and 2.89 (P = 1E-6) in EBCs
from patients with LC at stages I and II, respectively, demonstrating
the potential of our method for the detection of stage I/II LC.
Discussion
Breath capture methods for diagnostic purposes range from directly
breathing into a highly sensitive analysis platform (electronic Nose,
eNose) (Mehta et al, 2015b) or the relatively simple collection of
exhaled breath through cooling devices as proposed here. Recent
studies have reported the use of EBC for the detection of DNA muta-
tions and DNA methylation patterns in LC patients (Dent et al, 2013;
Xiao et al, 2014). However, there are some discrepancies between
different reports that can be explained as EBCs are highly diluted
mixtures of compounds. Thus, EBC-based LC diagnosis requires
appropriate stringent standardization protocols in order to reduce
variability and increase sensitivity of the technique (Horvath et al,
2005). Consistent with this line of reasoning, we established strict
SOPs for EBC collection, storage, and processing for isoform-specific
expression analysis. Our work demonstrated that RNA purified from
EBC can be used for qRT–PCR-based isoform-specific expression
analysis of GATA6 and NKX2-1, despite the relatively high fragmen-
tation of the isolated RNA (Appendix Supplementary Results). Simi-
larly, qRT–PCR-based expression of genes has been successfully

 performed using highly fragmented RNA isolated from FFPE samples
(Shane et al, 2010). Indeed, our SOPs for assay operation were
initially optimized using RNA isolated from FFPE samples and subse-
quently applied to EBCs. The specificity of our assay conditions was
demonstrated
by
sequencing
the
different
qRT–PCR
products
detected in the EBCs (Appendix Figs S1 and S2). Interestingly, a
sequence search in all public mRNA databases using AceView
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/Research/Acembly/)
revealed
four different transcripts of NKX2-1 and two of GATA6, including the
Em and Ad isoforms reported here. Further, the Em and Ad isoforms
of NKX2-1 have been reported in lung tissue (Li et al, 2000) whereas
the GATA6 isoforms were detected in other tissues (Brewer et al,
1999). Analysis of RNA-sequencing data deposited at The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA; http://cancergenome.nih.gov/) confirmed the
increased expression of the Em isoform of GATA6 in LC samples
when
compared
with
control
samples
(Fig EV5).

 discrimination between both NKX2-1 isoforms was not possible due
to the data format available at the TCGA.
Our SVM-based LC score classifier was unable to discriminate
between EBCs from patients with different NSCLC subtypes, thereby
showing clear limitations of our approach that could be overcome in
the future by extending the EBC-based expression analysis to known
markers of different NSCLC subtypes. Immunodetection of NKX2-1
in combination with NAPSA and immunonegativity of TP63 is suffi-
cient to distinguish ADC among the other NSCLC subtypes (Noh &
Shim, 2012). In contrast, we detected increased expression of the
Em isoform of NKX2-1 in all three subtypes of NSCLC. A plausible
explanation for this discrepancy might be that transcript detection is
more sensitive than immunodetection. Supporting this line of ideas,
amplification of NKX2-1 has been reported in 20% of 99 SQCC cases
analyzed by FISH but not detected at the protein level (Tang et al,
2011) and 14q13.3 amplification, containing NKX2-1, is one of the
most significant amplifications in SQCC reported in TCGA.
As
described
in
the
study
population,
IPF
(idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis) and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease) samples were included into the control groups since they
are
non-malignant
hyperproliferative
lung
diseases
with
an
increased risk of LC (Turner et al, 2007; Li et al, 2014). More-
over, IPF and COPD are frequently found comorbidities in LC.
Consistent with these findings, four of the eight wrongly classified
control
samples
in
the
validation
set
were
COPD
samples
(Appendix Table S3). Further, performance assessment values of
the LC score using a control population with (Fig 2E) or without
IPF and COPD samples (Table EV4) were similar, arguing against
a potential bias by incorporating the IPF and COPD samples into
the control population.
Even though our LC diagnosis method was externally validated
on an independent set of EBCs, the results of our study are insuffi-
cient to safely predict its usefulness under clinical conditions, for
which a suitably designed, large prospective study would be
required. Despite the limitations of our study, the results presented
here are promising, since our method is able to detect LC at stages I
and II. We propose to incorporate our method into the current
protocols
for
patients
undergoing
diagnostic
evaluation
for
pulmonary diseases characterized by hyperproliferation. In addition,
we suggest to integrate our technology into CT-based LC screening
approaches in high risk populations (Colditz et al, 2000; Bach et al,
2003; Spitz et al, 2007, 2008; de Torres et al, 2007; Cassidy et al,
2008), a procedure routinely used in the USA, but not in Europe due
to concerns regarding the very high percentage of false-positive
observations (> 90%) and hence low specificity (73.4%) (The
National Lung Screening Trial Research Team, 2013), resulting in
unnecessary follow-up CT scans, bronchoscopy, or even surgery
(Jett, 2005). Concomitant implementation of EBC-based LC detec-
tion together with CT could help to reduce the false-positive rate of
CT imaging, for example, in cases with suspicious image findings,
thereby preventing individuals from being unnecessarily exposed to
high dose of radiation or surgery. Routine implementation of EBC-
based molecular diagnosis may become an accurate, straightfor-
ward, non-invasive, and low-price option to complement the
success of CT for LC diagnosis.

 EBC-based LC diagnostic method is represented in Fig EV1. The
study population (described in Tables 1 and 2) consisted of two
types of samples, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human
lung tissue, and exhaled breath condensates (EBCs). Samples were
collected in two different cohorts located in Mexico and Germany,
allowing us to investigate ethnic differences. All participants
provided informed written consent.
During the first phase of the study, FFPE samples of either diag-
nostic transbronchial or bronchial biopsies or oncologic resections
were retrospectively collected. All cases were reviewed and staged
by an expert panel of pulmonologists and oncologists in the dif-
ferent cohorts according to the current diagnostic criteria for
morphological features and immunophenotypes recommended by
the International Union Against Cancer (Sobin et al, 2009). Inclusion
criteria for the FFPE lung tissue samples were primary small cell
lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
samples, including lung adenocarcinoma (ADC), squamous cell
carcinoma (SQCC), large cell carcinoma (LCC), and adenosquamous
carcinoma (ASCC; Table 1). Samples older than 5 years were
excluded. FFPE tissue samples of LC patients comprised approxi-
mately 80% tumor cells. The control population for the analysis of
FFPE samples included lung tissue that was taken from macroscopi-
cally healthy adjacent regions of the lung of LC patients and control
lung tissue that was obtained from age-matched donor lungs, who
had no diagnosis or family history of LC, in the frame of surgical
size reduction of the donor lung during lung transplantation. Lung
tissue samples from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, both diagnosed
according to international guidelines (www.goldcopd.org; Wuyts
et al, 2012), were also included in to the control population because
these lung diseases have been reported to increase LC risk when
compared to individuals with normal pulmonary function (Turner
et al, 2007; Li et al, 2014). In addition, the IPF and COPD cohorts
were included in the study to determine the discriminatory power of
the
diagnosis
method
proposed
here
with
respect
to
other
non-cancer
diseases
characterized
by
alveolar
or
bronchiolar
hyperproliferation.
During the second and third phases of the project, EBCs were
prospectively collected in two chronologically separated sets, train-
ing set, and validation set. Different operators in different cohorts
collected the EBCs using the optimized SOP thereby supporting
feasibility for clinical implementation. Inclusion criteria for both sets
of EBCs were that the patients were undergoing diagnostic evalua-
tion for LC, IPF, or COPD (prior to transbronchial biopsy) at the
Regional Hospital of High Specialties of Oaxaca (HRAEO), Mexico
(from July to December 2013), the Agaplesion Lung Clinic Waldhof
Elgershausen (from March 2014 to February 2015), and the Clinic of
the Universities of Giessen and Marburg (from October 2014 to
February 2015). The training set of EBCs was collected and used
during the second phase of the project for the development of the
LC score-based classifier and comprised 65 controls and 48 LC
patients (Table 1). The control population consisted of EBCs from
healthy donors (22 individuals with no symptoms, no complaints,
and no prior history of LC or any other pulmonary disease), IPF,
and COPD patients (33 and 10 EBCs, respectively). The rationale for
including the IPF and COPD cohorts into control population was
explained in the previous paragraph. The second set of EBCs (vali-
dation set, Table 1) was collected at a later time point with respect
to the training set and consisted of 78 independent controls and 60
previously unseen LC patients that were collected without prior
knowledge of the clinical diagnosis (blinded sample collection) by
different operators at different centers. The LC score-based classifier
was applied to the validation set of EBCs for external validation and
achieved high performance. The training and validation sets were
comparable in their distribution of controls and LC samples, smok-
ing history, age, and gender of the individuals (Table 2).
Within the LC groups of both types of samples, FFPE and EBCs,
sample distribution correlated with the general LC epidemiology:
the majority of the LC samples represented adenocarcinomas
(ADC), followed by squamous cell carcinomas (SQCC; Table 1); the
majority of the patients were in the age group of 50–70 years, were
current or former smokers, and both male and female patients were
equally represented (Table 2). Further, the majority of the patients
were in the stages I–III of the disease and only a minority had a
recurrent disease (Table 2). Importantly, the control groups were
representative of the LC groups with respect to age and gender
distribution (Table 2).
Exhaled breath condensate collection
Exhaled breath condensate collection was performed using the
RTube (Respiratory Research) as described online (http://www.res
piratoryresearch.com/products-rtube-how.htm) and following the
guidelines for EBC sampling by the ERS/ATS Task Force (Horvath
et al, 2005). For EBC collection, it was advised that all donors
refrain from eating and drinks (except water) for 2 h before EBC
collection. Donors were awake and breathing normally without
mechanical ventilation. Prior to EBC collection, donors were asked
to rinse the mouth with freshwater to avoid any additional contami-
nants. Sample was collected with the Rtube using a nose clamp to
avoid nasal contaminants, and breathing was only through the
mouthpiece. For each donor, EBC collection was performed for
10 min of tidal breathing. However, if the donors felt any discomfort
and/or inability to continue, a minimum time of 5 min was accept-
able without any loss in quality of the material obtained. After EBC
collection, the samples were stored immediately at �80°C in 500 ll
aliquots. It is essential that the samples are frozen as soon as
possible after EBC collection (Fig EV3E and F). The EBC was stored
in microcentrifuge tubes that were treated with RNaseZap (Life
technologies) and autoclaved twice. All steps during the collection
and processing of EBCs were performed under RNase-free condi-
tions, including the use of barrier–filter tips and cleaning all surfaces
and gloves with RNaseZap, which are critical to ensure the integrity
and quality of the samples.
Cell culture and mouse experiments
In this study, we used human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (A549;
CCL-185
and
A427;
HTB-53)
and
a
human
bronchoalveolar
carcinoma cell line (H322; CRL-5806). In addition, Mus musculus
Lewis lung cancer cell line (LLC1; CRL-1642) was used in a mouse
model of experimental metastasis, wherein 1 million LLC1 cells were
injected into the tail vein of experimental mice. For the xenograft
model, lung tumors were generated by intratracheal instillation of
2 million A549 cells into BALB/c nu/nu mice as described (Savai
et al, 2009).

 Cell lines were cultured in medium and conditions recommended
by the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cells were used
for the preparation of RNA (QIAGEN RNeasy plus mini kit).
Five- to six-week-old C57BL6 and 7- to 8-week-old BALB/c nu/nu
mice were used in this study. Animals were housed under controlled
temperature and lighting [12/12-h light/dark cycle], fed with
commercial animal feed and water ad libitum. For the mouse model
of experimental metastasis, LLC1 cell suspension of 1 million cells/
100 ll was prepared in sterile phosphate buffer saline (PBS). C57BL6
control mice (n = 3) were injected with 100 ll PBS whereas experi-
mental mice (n = 5) with 100 ll of cell suspension into the tail vein
of each mouse. The development of tumors was monitored 21 days
post-injection. Lung tissue was harvested from each mouse sepa-
rately for RNA isolation and isoform-specific expression analysis.
Mouse work was performed in compliance with the German Law
for Welfare of Laboratory Animals. The permission to perform the
experiments presented in this study was obtained from the Regional
Council
(Regierungspra
¨sidium
in
Darmstadt,
Germany).
The
numbers of the permissions are V54-19c20/15-B2/345; IVMr46-
53r30.03.MPP04.12.02; and IVMr46-53r30.03.MPP06.12.01. Animals
were killed for scientific purposes according to the law mentioned
above which complies with national and international regulations.
Gene expression analysis by qRT–PCR
Total RNA was isolated from cell lines using the RNeasy Mini kit
(Qiagen). Human lung tissue samples were obtained as formalin-
fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues, and eight sections of 10-lm
thickness were used for total RNA isolation using the RecoverAll
TM
Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit for FFPE (Ambion). Total RNA isola-
tion from EBC was performed using 500 ll of sample and the
RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was
synthetized using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit
(Applied Biosystem) with 0.5–0.7 lg (EBC) or 1 lg (FFPE sample)
total RNA. RT reaction without adding enzyme was used as negative
control. qRT–PCRs were performed using SYBR� Green on the Step
One plus Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) using the
primers specified in the Appendix Table S1. Briefly, 1× concentra-
tion of the SYBR Green master mix, 250 nM each forward and
reverse primer, and 3.5 ll (EBC) or 1 ll (cell lines, mice and human
lung cancer tissue) from a sixfold diluted RT reaction were used for
the gene-specific qPCR.
The integrity of isolated mRNA and the performance of the RT
reaction were determined by ratios of expression of the housekeep-
ing genes GAPDH and HPRT1 using two different primer pairs that
were complementary to different regions of the respective mRNAs
(Fig EV3E–H). Two negative controls were used: adding H2O instead
of cDNA in the PCR, and cDNA from a control lung tissue was used
as template that would give unequivocally negative results. Three
different positive controls were used: Serial dilutions (103 copies to 1
copy) of the plasmids containing the cloned PCR product were used
as “calibrator” to determine the linear range of the system; cDNA
from human lung cancer cell lines A549 and H520 was used as the
“analytical standard” that should give unequivocally positive results
and cDNA from human LC biopsies was used as the “biological stan-
dard” that provides unequivocally positive results. All PCRs were
performed at least in triplicates. The PCR results were normalized
with respect to the housekeeping gene TUBA1A.
Isolation and characterization of exosomes from EBCs
Exosomes were isolated from EBCs using ExoQuick-TC Exosome
precipitation solution (SBI) with minor changes. EBCs (500 ll) were
thawed on ice for 5 min, and 120 ll of ExoQuick-TC was added to
the EBC. Exosomes were precipitated by 6 h incubation at 4°C and
centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 30 min at 4°C. Exosome pellets were
lysed in 350 ll RLT Plus Buffer (RNeasy Micro Kit, Qiagen), and
200 ng of 16S- and 23S-ribosomal Spike-In RNA (Roche) was added
to the lysate. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Micro Kit
(Qiagen), and isoform-specific expression analysis was performed as
explained above.
Total protein extracts from control and LC snap-frozen tissue
samples were analyzed by Western blotting following standard proto-
cols (Singh et al, 2014) and using antibodies specific for CD63 (ab8219,
Abcam), TSG101 (sc-7964, Santa Cruz), and ACTB (ab6276, Abcam).
Classifier construction and LC score
Log2-transformed Em/Ad ratios of GATA6 and NKX2-1 were used as
independent variables to predict LC. A linear kernel support vector
machine (SVM) (Dimitriadou et al, 2010) was used to construct a
linear classifier by combining the Em/Ad ratios of GATA6 and NKX2-1
of each sample. SVM learning was done with the default parameters,
without any adjustments. The SVM finds a robust separating hyper-
plane and the distance to this hyperplane is our decision score, which
we call LC score. The LC score can be conveniently calculated as
LC score ¼ ð0:715 � log2
GATA6 Em
GATA6 Ad
�
�
þ log2
NKX2 � 1 Em
NKX2 � 1 Ad
�
�
� 0:855 þ 1:312Þ
A sample with LC score >0 will be classified as a lung cancer
sample; otherwise, the samples are classified as control samples
(Appendix Tables S2 and S3).
The linear SVM was chosen for this study because it is less sensi-
tive to (unbalanced) sample group sizes and/or batch variations,
thereby providing robust and reproducible results irrespective of the
minor variations that might be present in clinical settings. SVM was
also preferred over other common modeling approaches for devel-
oping predictors due to several reasons. Linear discriminant analysis
(LDA) relies on the assumption of normally distributed data, which
does not apply to our data set. K-nearest neighbors (kNN) lead to
complex classifier and do not give rise to a score like our LC score.
Logistic regression gives also linear decision boundaries, but it is
more sensitive to extreme samples/values than SVM. Other strength
of our SVM-based approach, when compared to standard expression
analysis (Wang & Huang, 2011), is the use of transcript isoform
expression ratios of two different genes because it incorporates an
additional normalization step to our assay reducing variability
coming from biological parameters.
Statistical analysis
Cell line and mouse experiments were performed three times.
Samples were analyzed at least in triplicates. Statistical analysis was
performed using R (R Core Team, 2014). In the main figures, the

 data are represented as box plots which indicate the first quartile
(bottom of the box), the median (line in the middle of the box) and
third quartile (top of the box). The whiskers end at the highest and
lowest data values. The five-number summaries are given in Tables
EV1–EV3. Depending on the data, different tests were performed to
determine the statistical significance of the results. The values of
these tests are also given in Tables EV1–EV3. Since the Em/Ad
expression ratios were not normally distributed according to the
Shapiro–Wilk test (P < 0.01 for all groups), we performed a
Kruskal–Wallis test for the results in Figs 1B and C and 2A–C
(Table EV1). The LC score data were normally distributed based on
the Shapiro–Wilk test (P = 0.02375, Ctrl group; P = 0.1448, LC
group). Thus, a Tukey’s honestly significant difference (HSD) test
was performed after one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the
results presented in Figs 1D and 3B and C (Table EV2). For Fig 3A,
we performed a Tukey’s HSD after multivariate analysis of variance
(MANOVA; Table EV3). In the EV Figs, the data are represented as
mean � standard error (mean � s.e.m.). One-way ANOVA was
used to determine the levels of difference between the groups.
P-values ˂ 0.05 were considered as statistically significant.

The paper explained
Problem
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.
Despite significant advances in therapeutic strategies, the case fatality
rate of lung cancer remains exceptionally high (95%), since the major-
ity of the patients are diagnosed at late stages when patient progno-
sis is poor. Current diagnostic strategies include chest X-ray, low-dose
helical
computed
tomography,
sputum
cytology,
and
invasive
sampling. Biochemical and molecular analysis of exhaled breath
condensates (EBC) may represent another, non-invasive approach, but
has shown inconsistent results in the past.
Results
In this study, we have developed an accurate lung cancer diagnostic
test based on the expression analysis of embryonic versus adult
isoforms of two genes (GATA6, NKX2-1) in exhaled breath condensates.
This diagnosis method is based on specific molecular changes during
lung cancer initiation and achieves a high sensitivity of 98.3% and
specificity of 89.7%.
Impact
We propose this method as an accurate, straightforward, non-invasive
and low-price option to achieve LC diagnosis in suspected cases not
subjectable to invasive sampling and a valuable addition to LC screen-
ing procedures based on low-dose computed tomography.
