Objective and design: Some studies suggest that specific hormonal contraceptive
methods [particularly depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA)] may increase
women’s HIV acquisition risk. We updated a systematic review to incorporate recent
epidemiological data.
Methods: We searched for articles published between 15 January 2014 and 15 January
2016 and hand-searched reference lists. We identified longitudinal studies comparing
users of a specific hormonal contraceptive method against either nonusers of hormonal
contraception or users of another specific hormonal contraceptive method. We added
newly identified studies to those in the previous review, assessed study quality, created
forest plots to display results, and conducted a meta-analysis for data on DMPA versus
non-use of hormonal contraception.
Results: We identified 10 new reports of which five were considered ‘unlikely to inform
the primary question’. We focus on the other five reports, along with nine from the
previous review, which were considered ‘informative but with important limitations’.
The preponderance of data for oral contraceptive pills, injectable norethisterone
enanthate, and levonorgestrel implants do not suggest an association with HIV acqui-
sition, though data for implants are limited. The new, higher quality studies on DMPA
(or nondisaggregated injectables), which had mixed results in terms of statistical
significance, had hazard ratios between 1.2 and 1.7, consistent with our meta-analytic
estimate for all higher quality studies of hazard ratio 1.4.
Conclusion: Although confounding in these observational data cannot be excluded,
new information increases concerns about DMPA and HIV acquisition risk in women. If
the association is causal, the magnitude of effect is likely hazard ratio 1.5 or less. Data
for other hormonal contraceptive methods, including norethisterone enanthate, are
largely reassuring.

 Introduction
Empowering
women
and
couples
with
the
tools
necessary to prevent unintended pregnancy and avoid
sexually transmitted infections including HIV is critically
important for individual and public health. Hormonal
contraceptive methods are highly effective for prevention
of
unintended
pregnancy
and
associated
sequelae.
However, some epidemiological studies suggest an
association between use of specific hormonal contra-
ceptive methods [particularly depot medroxyprogester-
one acetate (DMPA)] and an increased risk of HIV
acquisition in women; other studies have not reported
this association [1]. This question is critically important
for women’s health, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa,
where high rates of HIV coincide with high use of
injectable contraception [2]. Many regions with high
HIV prevalence also have high rates of unmet need for
contraception, unintended pregnancy, and maternal
mortality and morbidity, underlying the imperative for
access to effective contraception [3,4].
Several biologically plausible mechanisms have been
postulated to explain how various hormonal contra-
ceptive methods could increase women’s risk of HIV
acquisition, including possible disruption of epithelial
barriers, alterations in immune cell populations, or
soluble inflammatory responses [5–8]. The effect of
hormonal
contraception
on
cervical
immunity
is
influenced by the genital tract microenvironment and
presence of infections [9]. Interpretation of current data
on biologic and immunologic impacts from hormonal
contraceptive use is hampered by studies that fail to
account for different hormones, diverse dosages, and
hormonal contraceptive delivery routes [7]. Women
using particular hormonal contraceptive methods may
also have other characteristics (e.g. different patterns of
condom use), which could impact HIV acquisition risk.
A previous systematic review of epidemiological evidence
assessed all relevant evidence published prior to 15
January 2014 [1]. The review was conducted indepen-
dently of the WHO guidance development process and
served as an input into WHO deliberations related to
updating the medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive
use (refer to Appendix A, http://links.lww.com/QAD/
A969 for current WHO guidance for hormonal contra-
ceptive use among women at high risk of HIV) [10].
Given the public health importance of this topic, we
updated our previous systematic review to incorporate
newly published, pertinent epidemiological evidence.
Methods
We conducted this systematic review according to
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses guidelines [11].
Inclusion/exclusion criteria
We included published primary research reportson women
who were HIV-negative at baseline in longitudinal studies
(observational studies or randomized trials, or meta-
analyses containing data not otherwise captured in our
search strategy) that measured incident, laboratory-
confirmed HIV infection among women who used a
specific method of hormonal contraception [injectables,
oral contraceptives, implants, patches, rings, or levonor-
gestrel intrauterine devices (LNG-IUDs)] compared with
incident HIV infections among women using a non-
hormonal contraceptive method (e.g. condoms, nonhor-
monal
IUD,
sterilization,
withdrawal,
etc.)
or
no
contraceptive method (henceforth, ‘hormonal contra-
ceptive versus non-use of hormonal contraception’
comparisons). Some studies compared hormonal contra-
ceptive users againsta heterogeneous group including other
hormonalcontraceptiveusers,nonhormonalmethodusers,
and nonusers of contraception. We identified and included
such studies, but considered the composition of the
comparison group when assessing study quality.
We also included studies comparing incident HIV
infection among HIV-negative women using a specific
method of hormonal contraception against HIV-negative
women using another specific method of hormonal
contraception (henceforth, ‘head-to-head’ analyses) in
which the comparison group did not contain non-
hormonal method users or nonusers of contraception.
We excluded studies that did not report a risk estimate for
the relationship between hormonal contraceptive use and
HIV acquisition, cross-sectional studies, studies assessing
only emergency contraception, conference abstracts, or
other unpublished reports.
Search strategy
We retained all articles included in the previous systematic
review, unless superseded by a new published analysis
based upon the same data. We searched PubMed and
Embase
(Appendix
B,
http://links.lww.com/QAD/
A969) for articles published in any language between
15 January 2014 and 15 January 2016, inclusive. We
hand-searched reference lists of included studies. C.B.P
.
conducted the literature search and C.B.P
., K.M.C., and
P
.C.H. screened titles, abstracts, and full-text manuscripts
to determine inclusion using Covidence software [12].
Data extraction and quality assessment
We applied a study quality assessment framework used in
our 2014 systematic review, with slight modifications for
clarity [1]. Briefly, studies that did not include adjustment
for condom use or which had unclear measurement
of exposure to hormonal contraception (refer to Appendix
C, http://links.lww.com/QAD/A969 for a full expla-
nation of the quality assessment criteria) were considered
‘unlikely to inform the primary question’. For compre-
hensiveness, we included all studies that met our inclusion

 criteria, regardless of quality. However, we focused on
studies with neither of the two quality concerns noted
above; we considered these studies ‘informative but with
important limitations’ (IBWILs) to acknowledge that all
studies to date are vulnerable to residual or uncontrolled
confounding. All authors participated in confirming the
study quality assessment framework and in rating the
quality of each study. We adapted previously used
abstraction forms that were pilot tested by all coauthors.
All coauthors abstracted data from each newly included
study that was considered as IBWIL. We contacted study
investigators if clarifications were needed.
Graphical summaries
We created forest plots using Microsoft Excel 2013
(Microsoft, Redmond, Washington, USA) to summarize
point estimates for a given contraceptive method [i.e. oral
contraceptives, injectables (nonspecified, DMPA, and nore-
thisterone enanthate (NET
-EN)), or implants]. We focus on
graphics summarizing only studies considered IBWIL, but
graphs depicting all studies regardless of quality are provided
in Appendix D, http://links.lww. com/QAD/A969.
Most
studies
estimated
hazards
ratios
using
Cox
proportional hazards models; some also included esti-
mates from a marginal structural model (MSM) (for
additional discussion, refer to [1,13]). A few estimated
only incidence rate ratios (IRRs) (Tables 1 and 2). For
clarity of presentation, we display the IRR or Cox
hazards
ratio,
unless
the
MSM
model
generated
qualitatively different estimates, in which case both
Cox and MSM estimates are shown.
As in 2014, we requested disaggregated estimates from
authors of new studies classified as IBWIL and which
included women from South Africa (where use of
both DMPA and NET-EN is common) but which did not
report
separate
estimates
for
each.
Disaggregated
estimates have reduced statistical power but greater
epidemiological and clinical value, given the potential for
different
biological
effects
by
contraceptive
type
or formulation.
Meta-analysis
Given concerns specific to DMPA, we performed a
statistical meta-analysis for the effect of DMPA versus
non-use of hormonal contraception on HIV acquisition
(studies that did not disaggregate injectables were not
included). For maximum comparability, we included the
most fully adjusted Cox hazards ratio estimates from each
study, except one that reported an adjusted IRR (IRRs
can be interpreted similarly to hazards ratios under certain
conditions [14]). We log-transformed reported adjusted
point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) to
calculate standard errors using a random effects model
[15]. We assessed statistical heterogeneity using the I2
statistic [16]. Analyses were performed using Stata
(Version 13.1, College Station, Texas, USA).

Description of included studies
T
wenty-two studies were included in our previous review
[1]. For this review, we screened 312 new references,
assessed 14 full-text reports, and excluded four: two did
not report on the association of interest [17,18] and two
meta-analyses contained published data already captured
by our search strategy (including them would have
resulted in double-counting of data, instead they are
mentioned in our discussion) (Fig. 1) [19,20].
We included 10 new reports [21–30]; one [21] super-
seded a previously included study [31]. A large, individual
participant data (IPD) meta-analysis [26] used raw data
from 18 datasets, including seven not previously utilized
to investigate the association of interest [17,32–37]. To
incorporate the previously unpublished information
(while avoiding double-counting from previously pub-
lished studies), we requested a subanalysis restricted to
data from these seven studies in a hormonal contraceptive
versus non-use of hormonal contraception comparison
[38]. The IPD meta-analysis also included a head-to-
head comparison that none of our included component
studies had assessed; here we used results from the original
article [26].
Table 1 describes 10 newly included studies; information
on previously included studies is available elsewhere [1].
A total of 31 studies (comprising 34 reports) were
included [21–30,39–62]. Thirty assessed hormonal
contraceptive versus non-use of hormonal contraception
comparisons [21–29,39–62] and two assessed head-to-
head comparisons [26,30].
Among 30 studies with hormonal contraceptive versus
non-use of hormonal contraception comparisons, 24
included estimates specific to (or largely composed of)
oral
contraceptives
[21–24,26,27,29,39,41–46,49–
53,55–59,61,62].
Twenty-four
included
estimates
specific to (or largely composed of) injectables [21,24–
29,39–48,50–53,55,56,58,60,62] and three included
implant-specific estimates [27,39,50,54]. All studies
assessing DMPA assessed intramuscular DMPA, rather
than the lower dose, subcutaneous formulation. No study
assessed contraceptive patches, rings, combined inject-
ables, or LNG-IUDs. Among two head-to-head studies,
two compared DMPA versus NET-EN [26,30] and one
compared DMPA versus combined oral contraceptives
(COCs) and NET-EN versus COCs [26].

[21,26,27,29,39,42,43,47,51–53,55,56,58],
including
four newly identified studies [21,26,27,29]. Table 2
provides details on new IBWIL studies; information on
previously included IBWIL studies is available elsewhere
[1]. The four new studies included a large IPD meta-
analysis that assessed oral contraceptives, DMPA, and
NET-EN across a range of datasets [26], an analysis from
an 18-year cohort study of Zambian serodiscordant
couples to assess oral contraceptives, DMPA, and implants
[27], and two analyses from large microbicide trials, one
assessing unspecified injectables [29] and the other
assessing oral contraceptives, DMPA, and NET-EN
[21]. Below, we summarize results from all 12 hormonal

 contraceptive versus non-use of hormonal contraception
studies considered IBWIL. Readers should consult the
relevant tables and figures for additional detail (such as
95% CIs); descriptions below provide a succinct synthesis
of the overall evidence base. We discuss studies according
to whether results were significant at P less than 0.05, but
acknowledge that, considered alone, P values are an
imperfect indicator of significance [63].
Implants
Neither of two IBWIL studies assessing levonorgestrel-
based implants (Norplant or Jadelle) [27,39,54] suggested
a statistically significant increased risk of HIV
. Point
estimates ranged from adjusted hazards ratio (adjHR) 0.96
to 1.60; 95% CIs were wide.
Oral contraceptives
Of 11 IBWIL studies assessing oral contraceptives
[21,26,27,29,38,39,42,51–53,55,56,58], one reported a
marginally significant increase in risk (adjHR: 1.46,
P ¼ 0.05); 10 reported nonsignificant estimates ranging
from adjusted incidence rate ratios (adjIRR) 0.66 to
adjHR 1.80 (Fig. 2). One study disaggregated COCs
and progestin-only pills (POPs); point estimates were
similar and nonsignificant (adjHR: 0.86 and 0.98,
respectively) [51].
Injectables
Of 12 IBWIL studies assessing injectables (DMPA, NET-
EN, or a mix of both) [21,26,27,29,38,39,42,47,51–
53,55,56,58], nine provided DMPA-specific estimates
and three provided estimates for unspecified injectables.
Five studies reported a statistically significant increase in
risk with either unspecified injectables [42] or DMPA
[21,26,38,39,52,53], although the point estimate in one
was not statistically significant in a Cox proportional
hazards model [53] (Figs. 3 and 4). Point estimates from
Cox models from these five studies ranged from adjHR
1.45 to 2.04 (Figs. 3 and 4) [21,26,38,39,42,52,53]; the
largest estimate under an MSM model was 2.19 [42].

 Among seven studies reporting nonstatistically significant
results, point estimates ranged from adjIRR 0.46
to adjHR 1.34 (both DMPA-specific) [27,29,47,51,

reported statistically significant increases in HIV risk:

(Fig. 5) [21,26,38,47,51,55,56].
Head-to-head studies considered informative but
with important limitations
No head-to-head comparison studies were available in
the previous review [1]. Both newly included head-to-
head studies were considered IBWIL (Tables 1 and 2)
[26,30]. Both reported a statistically significant increased
risk of HIV for DMPA use (adjHR: 1.32 and 1.41) versus
NET-EN use [26,30]. The IPD meta-analysis also
compared each injectable against COCs, reporting
significantly increased risk for DMPA versus COCs
(adjHR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.23–1.67) and a borderline
nonsignificant increased risk for NET-EN versus COCs:
adjHR 1.30 (0.99–1.71) (Fig. 6) [26].
Meta-analysis
Ten estimates, from nine published studies with DMPA-
specific estimates versus non-use of hormonal contra-
ception [21,27,39,42,47,51,53,55,56] and a subanalysis of
previously unpublished information from an IPD meta-
analysis [26], were included in our meta-analysis of the
effect of DMPA on HIVacquisition (Appendix D, Fig. 5,
http://links.lww.com/QAD/A969). The overall effect
estimate was 1.40 (95% CI: 1.23–1.59) with an I2 of 0%,
indicating minimal quantitative heterogeneity.

 older women [52]; eight studies reported no effect
modification by age [21,27,29,39,42,47,51,56]; most
studies reported no effect modification by herpes simplex
virus type 2 (HSV-2) status [21,29,39,42,51], whereas
two reported effect modification in opposite directions
[One observed higher HIV risk with DMPA in HSV-2
seronegative women (Morrison et al. [52]) and the other
observed higher HIV risk with DMPA (versus NET-EN)
in HSV-2 seropositive women (Noguchi et al. [30]).].
Two studies reported no effect of modification by study
site [21,30], one reported greater risk for oral contra-
ceptives and DMPA in a Ugandan site versus a
Zimbabwean site [53]. A study in serodiscordant couples
reported no effect modification for genital ulceration,
inflammation, viral load of HIV-positive partner at
baseline, or fertility intentions [27]. Another study
reported no effect modification by reported condom
use at baseline, participant behavioral risk, or prevalent
chlamydia or gonorrhea [53].
Within the IPD meta-analysis, assessment for effect
modification was conducted with information from all
18 studies (some of which were also included in our
review). No evidence of interaction was reported with
any method for age (15–24 versus >25 years), HSV-2
status at baseline, or HIV incidence in population
(low
versus
high)
[26].

reported engaging in transactional sex work had an
increased HIV risk with COCs (adjHR: 1.51, 95% CI:

work. Finally, smaller point estimates were observed

Discussion
Interpretation of overall results
As in our 2014 review, current data do not suggest an
increased risk of HIV acquisition among women using
oral contraceptives [1]. Extremely limited data do not
suggest a statistically significant increased risk of HIV
acquisition among users of levonorgestrel implants; no
data are available regarding etonogestrel implants. In
2014, one of five studies that was considered IBWIL
suggested an increased risk of HIVacquisition with NET-
EN injectables [31]. In this updated review, that study was
replaced by a larger, more sophisticated analysis of the
same dataset [21], and increased HIV risk was no longer
observed. Thus, currently available data for injectable
NET-EN use do not suggest an association with HIV
acquisition in women.
Although concerns around confounding in observational
data remain relevant, newly available evidence regarding
injectable DMPA use increases concern about a potential
causal association with HIV acquisition. Twelve studies
considered IBWIL assessed DMPA or nondisaggregated
injectables compared with non-use of hormonal contra-
ception; four or five (depending on the statistical model
considered) reported statistically significant increased
risks of HIVacquisition, ranging from adjHR 1.45 to 2.04
in Cox models (or 2.19 in MSM models). Among four
newly included studies, two reported statistically signifi-
cant increased risk (adjHR: 1.45 and 1.69), including one
very large study [21] and a subanalysis of a large IPD
meta-analysis [26]. A smaller study among serodiscordant
couples [27] reported a nonsignificant estimate of adjHR
1.34, and data from a microbicide trial also had a
nonsignificant estimate of adjHR 1.17 but did not
disaggregate between injectables [29]. Head-to-head
comparisons were newly available and may be less
confounded by unmeasured or
residual behavioral
differences than comparisons from hormonal contra-
ceptive versus non-use of hormonal contraception
studies, particularly if groups compared in head-to-head
studies use different types of the same delivery method
(i.e., injectable DMPAversus injectable NET-EN) [30]. A
head-to-head analysis of VOICE data reported a 41%

 increased risk of HIV acquisition in DMPA versus NET-
EN users [30]. In the IPD meta-analysis [26], DMPA use
was associated with a significantly increased risk of HIV
acquisition of 30–40% when compared with either NET-
EN or COC use. Comparing NET-EN against COC
users suggested higher risk with NET-EN, though this
was not statistically significant at P less than 0.05
(P ¼ 0.055). Although residual confounding cannot be
ruled out in any observational study, several recently
published studies suggesting an increased risk of HIV
acquisition among DMPA users had few limitations apart
from being observational (Table 2).
Recent analyses contradict the hypothesis that differential
over-reporting of condom use by hormonal contra-
ceptive users explains observed associations between
hormonal contraceptive use and HIV infection in some
studies [64]. However, the possibility remains that certain
confounders are specific to DMPA users. In South Africa
(where both DMPA and NET-EN injectables are used),
studies suggest that women perceive DMPA and NET-
EN differently, and providers may preferentially prescribe
different injectable types to specific subpopulations,
which could result in confounding specific to injectable
type [30,65,66]. Although beyond the scope of this
review, emerging evidence related to DMPA and HSV-2
acquisition must also be considered [67,68].
Taken
together,
the
new evidence
points
toward
heightened concerns that the association between DMPA
use and HIV acquisition may not be fully explained by
confounding or other methodological problems. In
contrast, additional reassuring evidence of no significant
association for other hormonal contraceptive methods
(oral contraceptives, NET-EN, and implants) is newly
available. If the association between DMPA and HIV
acquisition risk is causal, meta-analyses, including our
own, suggest a likely increase in risk of hazards ratio 1.5
or less.
The quality of epidemiological evidence on this issue has
improved over time. Several newly published studies used
recent analytic recommendations [13] or other innovative
analytic techniques. For example, Crook et al. [21]
conducted
a
particularly
thorough
exploration
of
statistical methodology and incorporated multiple sensi-
tivity analyses to assess the robustness of their findings,
Morrison et al. [26] contributed substantial new data in a
carefully conducted IPD meta-analysis, and Noguchi
et al. [30] examined an alternative comparison group
(NET
-EN users).

methodological
contribution
of

newly
published meta-analyses varied. In addition to the IPD

 analyses [19,20] utilized data already included as primary
studies in our systematic reviews (thus, adding no
information beyond that already included in this review).
Although all three meta-analyses reported summary
estimates for DMPA similar to our own (hazards ratio
1.4–1.5), one of the excluded meta-analyses contained
no assessment of study quality and included several studies
with serious methodological limitations [20], which raises
particular concern in the context of meta-analysis of
observational data (Table 3) [69]. Both excluded meta-
analyses [19,20] double-counted [70] data by inclusion of
both Wand and Ramjee [31] and Crook et al. [21]. We
generated a meta-analytic estimate for DMPA, but
recommend that such results be interpreted with caution,
given the potential for spurious precision in meta-analyses
of observational data [71]. The I2 value for our meta-
analysis suggested minimal statistical heterogeneity, but
qualitative differences between study populations and
methods remain an important consideration [16]. That
said, estimates from all four meta-analyses are similar,
despite inclusion of slightly different component studies
[26].
Limitations
Previous reviews have addressed key methodological
considerations about this body of literature, including
potential for confounding, frequency, and accuracy of
variable measurement, considerations related to ‘direct’
and ‘total’ effects, potential for publication bias, and
limitations of individual studies, such as failure of some
studies to disaggregate by specific hormonal content or
formulation (e.g., most studies assessing oral contra-
ceptives failed to disaggregate estimates by COCs or
POPs) [1,72]. Our study quality framework is necessarily
subjective, and we encourage continued discussion on
how best to evaluate study quality in this body
of evidence.
Conclusion
There remain no data on use of contraceptive patches,
rings, or hormonal IUDs and HIVacquisition in women.
For implants, very limited data pertaining to levonorges-
trel implants do not suggest increased risk, but more
information is needed. In comparison, a larger amount of
data are available for oral contraceptives and are generally
reassuring. A growing number of studies have assessed
injectable NET-EN, and although still limited, data are
generally reassuring. For injectable DMPA, although
some new, high-quality studies do not report a statistically
significant increased risk of HIV acquisition, other new
data, including studies directly comparing DMPA and
NET-EN, tend to strengthen concerns about DMPA. If
the association between DMPA and HIVacquisition risk
is causal, data suggest a likely increase in risk of hazards
ratio 1.5 or less. Several new studies have used recently
proposed recommendations for analysis or other inno-
vative methodological approaches [13], although as with
all observational data, the possibility of uncontrolled or
residual confounding remains. The growing, generally
reassuring evidence about other hormonal contraceptive
methods, including other injectables like NET-EN,
stands in contrast to the DMPA-specific findings. An
important next step is for WHO to determine whether
these concerns warrant a reconsideration of global
guidance for DMPA. Modeling studies can be useful in
understanding net health impacts of various policy
responses in different epidemiological contexts, including
the risk of HIV
, maternal mortality and morbidity, and
access to alternative contraception and HIV prevention
methods [2,73–76].
