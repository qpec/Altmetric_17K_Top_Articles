Context: Both adherence and outcomes are more difficult to measure in patients
with multiple sclerosis (MS) than in patients with diseases such as hypertension,
for which most medications are taken orally and surrogate outcomes (eg, blood
pressure) are routinely collected.
Objectives: To characterize the adherence and outcomes of patients with MS within
a large integrated health system and to assess the relationship between adherence and
outcomes.
Study Design: Retrospective review of adherence and health care utilization
outcomes via electronic health records and claims (2004-2013) combined with a
prospective survey regarding adherence and functional outcomes (2012-2013).
Methods: Retrospectively, medication possession ratios were calculated, and adher-
ence groups were compared regarding health care utilization and costs. Prospectively,
patients were recruited to complete questionnaires to measure self-reported adherence
(SRA) and MS-specific outcomes, including the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale
(MSIS), the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), and the Treatment
Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM). Regression was used to statistic-
ally test for differences in these outcomes among adherence groups.
Results: A total of 681 patients were studied. Most patients (307 of 375 [82%] in
the retrospective cohort and 244 of 306 [89%] in the prospective cohort) had
greater that 80% adherence to their MS medications. Mean inpatient days per
patient for MS-related admissions was highest for high-adherence than for inter-
mediate and low-adherence patients (0.52 vs 0.23 and 0.34, respectively; P<.001),
but no other associations between adherence and health care utilization were found.
Mean outpatient costs and total costs were lowest for the low-adherence group, sug-
gesting that higher adherence may not guarantee cost savings overall. Patients with
intermediate and high self-reported adherence showed significantly better mean
scores than patients with low adherence on several MS outcomes, including EDSS
(4.1 and 4.2 vs 4.8, P<.05), MSIS physical function (33 and 35 vs 41, P<.05), and
TSQM Global Satisfaction (75 and 78 vs 70, P<.05).
Conclusions: The findings of this study indicate that patients with MS are mostly
adherent to their existing treatments. Patients with greater medication adherence may
have increased cost, but their physical outcomes are better. This finding may shed
light on other chronic disease entities and how we view the success of treatments.

 M
ultiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease
of the central nervous system character-
ized by inflammation, demyelination, and
axonal degeneration.1 Multiple sclerosis is the most
common cause of neurologic disability in young
adults, with a mean age of onset of 33 years, and it is
most prevalent among whites.2 The prevalence is
estimated to be 135 per 100,000 in the United States,
with approximately 12,000 newly diagnosed cases of
MS reported annually.2,3 Twelve disease-modifying
agents are approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration.4 Many factors may affect adherence to
MS medications, including fear of needles, frequency
of administration, perceived lack of efficacy, mental
illness or depressed mood, and adverse effects, such as
injection-site reactions, infections, and flulike symp-
toms.5-7 Additionally, patients may encounter financial
and logistical challenges to obtaining their MS medica-
tions, which vary based on a patient’s health insurance
provider, medical history, disease severity, and specific
medication; these challenges affect medication adher-
ence because adherence requires access.
The impact of adherence on outcomes, however, is
more challenging to study for patients with MS than
for patients with other conditions, such as diabetes or
hypertension, which have been reported on exten-
sively.8-10 First, unlike diabetes or hypertension, for
which surrogate outcome measures such as glycated
hemoglobin or blood pressure can be routinely mea-
sured and captured in electronic health records
(EHRs), MS has no easily obtainable and comparable
surrogate measures. Second, adverse events may take
the form of relapses or new lesions identified in
imaging studies, which are not routinely captured in a
quantitative fashion. Third, some treatments for patients
with MS are injections, as opposed to an oral medica-
tion for which both the prescription orders and phar-
macy claims indicate clearly the number of days’
supply of medication being provided.
Because of these challenges, there are few literature
reports related to treatment adherence in patients with
MS.11 Several studies have assessed adherence using
simple measures of patient self-reporting continuing,
discontinuing, or switching a medication at the time of
assessment,12-14 but such measures provide little
insight into the way in which patients adhere to their
prescribed medication regimens before a discontinu-
ation or switch. Turner et al11 reported the results of a
study in which medication adherence was assessed
monthly in a small cohort of Veterans’ Administration
patients using a single self-reported measure of the
number of missed doses during the previous month.
Although self-reported measures have limitations, self-
reported adherence may, in the absence of robust
claims or EHR data, be the optimal method for under-
standing
MS
treatment-related
adherence
on
a
day-to-day and week-to-week basis.
The purpose of this study was to use 2 approaches to
characterize treatment adherence and outcomes of
patients with MS within a large integrated health
system and to assess the relationship between adherence
and outcomes. We performed a retrospective examin-
ation of health care utilization and costs stratified by
adherence level as measured from claims data. We also
conducted a prospective survey-based assessment of
self-reported adherence and MS-specific outcomes.
Methods
Study Population
The study was conducted at Geisinger Health System,
an integrated delivery system primarily in central and
northeastern Pennsylvania. Geisinger Health System
includes Geisinger Clinic and an insurance provider
(Geisinger Health Plan)—a hospital-insurance network
with more than 40 primary care clinics, a large tertiary
care teaching hospital, and 11 other hospitals. The
initial study population was defined as all Geisinger
Clinic patients identified in the EHR who were aged
18 years or older when they met either of the following
criteria between January 1, 2004, and December 31,
2013: (1) an International Classification of Diseases,
9th Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis code for MS entered
on their problem list and an order for an MS

 medication; or (2) had at least 2 separate encounters
coded as MS and at least 1 medication order indicated
for MS.
We examined medication adherence and outcomes in
2 samples of this population, using both retrospective
and prospective approaches.
Retrospective Analysis
We used the subset of the MS population described
above who were also covered by the Geisinger Health
Plan for the entire period (approximately 30% of the
population) to describe medication adherence, health
care utilization, and costs as contained in the EHR and
claims records. Patients with fewer than 12 months of
health plan enrollment or who died during the
follow-up period were excluded. We removed 5 patients
who died during the follow-up period to have equal
follow-up time (12 months) for all patients. We recog-
nized that the high cost of end-of-life care may affect
outcomes, but we reran cost analyses including the
deceased patients’ data, and our results and conclusions
did not change meaningfully (results not shown).
Data extracted from the EHRs included demographic
variables (eg, age, sex, race); body mass index; and all
encounters, diagnoses, and procedures. Data extracted
from insurance claims included all diagnosis and pro-
cedure codes, prescriptions filled, total allowed amount
paid for each claim, and location of services.
Prospective Analysis
We recruited a random sample of the MS population
described above who were actively being seen by a
neurologist and taking MS medications stratified by
last known active medication. Medication adherence
and outcomes were assessed in this patient group
using a survey instrument. A self-reported adherence
(SRA) measure was calculated as the patient’s self-
report of the number of doses taken divided by the
number of doses prescribed in the previous month.
Patients were then assigned into 1 of 3 SRA categories
consistent with the medication possession ratio (MPR)
categories in the retrospective analysis: low, <80%;
intermediate, 80%-99%; or high, 100%. Surveys con-
sisted of a combination of published, validated, newly
developed questionnaires wherein patients reported
their doses taken in the past month, number of relapses,
Medical Outcome Study (MOS) Cognitive Function
Score,15,16 Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale
(EDSS),17 Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for
Medication (TSQM) satisfaction score,18 and Multiple
Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS) physical and psycho-
logical functional score.19 Number of relapses and all
self-reported outcome scores (eg, MOS, TSQM) were
then compared among SRA groups using nonparamet-
ric bootstrapped 95% CIs based on 1000 replications
and resampling at the patient (as opposed to score)
level to account for repeated measures. The patients
who consented were surveyed 3 times, 6 months apart
(baseline, 6-month, and 12-month follow-up) and were
also surveyed after any non–routine office visits to the
neurology department. Baseline surveys were com-
pleted in mid-2012, with follow-up surveys completed
in 2012 and 2013. Follow-up versions of the question-
naire (6-month, 12-month, and after office visits) were
similar to the baseline version, but follow-up surveys
did not ask the patients about the time since initial diag-
nosis, and after-visit follow-up surveys added a ques-
tion specifically about the reason for the patient’s most
recent MS appointment. This study received approval
from the Geisinger Institutional Review Board.
Analytic Approach
In the retrospective analysis, each patient’s records were
examined for 12 months before their most recent
medical encounter (eg, office visit), and MS medication
possession ratio (MPR)20 was calculated to assess
medication adherence during this period. Our primary
interest was adherence to the 6 major MS medications
(interferon β-1a, interferon β-1b, high-dose interferon
β-1a, glatiramer acetate, natalizumab, or fingolimod).
Medication possession ratio can only be calculated
when patients have a prescription filled at least 2 times
for the medications of interest, so patients with fewer
than 2 of these medications filled at least 2 times were

 excluded from further analysis. Patients were assigned
to 1 of 3 adherence categories based on MPR: low
(<80%), intermediate (80%-99%), and high (≥100%)
adherence.
The primary outcomes of interest were inpatient
admissions, emergency department (ED) visits, out-
patient visits, and health care costs during the study
follow-up period. The proportions of patients with
inpatient admissions, outpatient visits, and ED visits
were calculated both for all-cause utilization and
MS-related health care utilization only, estimated using
ICD-9 diagnosis codes associated with the encounter.
Encounters related to MS were defined as those for
which the primary ICD-9 diagnosis code associated
with the claim was for multiple sclerosis (ICD-9 340).
Health care costs were defined as the total cost of care
(health insurance payment to health care providers
plus patients’ copayments), and these costs were calcu-
lated per member per month. Per-member-per-month
costs were stratified by inpatient, outpatient, ED, and
prescription medication costs. All-cause vs MS-related
costs were calculated separately, with all costs adjusted
for inflation to 2013 US dollars.
To compare baseline patient characteristics among
the 3 adherence groups, we used χ2 tests (for categor-
ical variables, such as sex), Fisher exact tests (for
categorical variables with rare occurrences, such as
heart failure), or analysis of variance (for continuous
variables assumed to be normal, such as age). To
compare inpatient and outpatient health care utilization,
we used generalized linear models with logistic (for
binary outcomes) or Poisson (for discrete outcomes,
such as inpatient days) regression. Because medical
costs are not normally distributed, we used generalized
linear models with a log-γ distribution to compare costs
among adherence groups. We assumed that 40% of the
retrospective cohort would have low adherence (MPR
<80%), and our study was adequately powered to
detect a ±12% difference in percentages of patients
with ED visits between the low- and high-adherence
groups with 72% power, or a ±13% difference with
81% power, at the P<.05 significance level. All
analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4
software (SAS Institute Inc), with differences of P<.05
considered statistically significant.
Results
We identified an initial population of 2957 patients with
any MS diagnosis in the EHR, 1046 of whom were also
insurance plan members. After applying the remaining
inclusion/exclusion criteria, 375 patients met all inclu-
sion criteria for the retrospective analysis. For the pro-
spective study, we contacted 643 patients to participate,
with a response rate of 48% (n=306). These patients
completed a total of 971 surveys.
Table 1 displays the baseline characteristics of the
patients in the retrospective and prospective cohorts
(N=681), stratified by adherence categories. Overall,
patients in the retrospective cohort were predominantly
female (283 [75%]) and white (371 [99%]), with 149
patients (40%) having a body mass index of 30 or
greater. Depression (117 [31%]) and hypertension
(114 [30%]) were the most common comorbidities.
Patients in the prospective cohort had similar attributes:
259 (85%) were female, 302 (99%) were white, and
127 (42%) had a body mass index of 30 or greater.
Depression (125 [41%]) and hypertension (62 [20%])
were common comorbidities.
Both cohorts were extremely compliant with their
MS medications, with 307 of 375 retrospective patients
(82%) having an MPR adherence measure of 80% or
greater, and 244 of 306 prospective patients (80%)
having an SRA of 80% or above. In the retrospective
cohort, patients with low adherence (MPR <80%) were
statistically significantly more likely to have depression
(38% vs 26% and 34% in the intermediate- and
high-adherence groups), though a similar trend in the
prospective cohort was not statistically significant
(48% vs 38% and 42%). In the prospective cohort,
significantly more patients in the high-adherence
group (SRA 100%) had had chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (8%) and chronic kidney disease
(5%) (P=.02).

 Table 2 presents the health care utilization of the
patients in the retrospective cohort. Patients with high
adherence were the least likely to have any all-cause
ED visits (22% vs 25% and 31% for the other adher-
ence groups), but the differences among the 3 groups
were not statistically significant, nor were any of the
other comparisons for all-cause inpatient and ED util-
ization. Differences in the mean number of inpatient
days per patient for MS-related admissions were signifi-
cantly different among the 3 groups (P<.001), and a
follow-up pairwise test between the high-adherence
group and intermediate-adherence group showed a
significant difference, even after adjusting for multiple
comparisons (0.52 vs 0.23; P<.001). No other MS-
related health care utilization measures showed a statis-
tically significant relationship with adherence.
Table 3 presents the health care costs of patients in
the retrospective study, both all-cause and MS-related.
The mean total health care costs for patients in the low-
adherence group was significantly lower than for
patients in the intermediate- or high-adherence groups.
Although the patients in the high-adherence group had
lower inpatient costs on average, those costs seem to

 pharmacy-related costs. Whether examining all-cause
or MS-related health care utilization, the group with
intermediate adherence consistently had the highest
mean outpatient, pharmacy, and total health care costs
per person. Consistent with the health care utilization
results in Table 2, costs related to ED or inpatient care
did not show statistically significant trends with
adherence.
Table 4 compares the self-reported MS outcomes
and related measures among the 3 SRA groups.
Patients with intermediate and high adherence showed
statistically significantly better scores on EDSS and
MSIS physical scales than patients with low adherence.
Patients in the high-adherence group also had statistic-
ally significantly better mean MSIS psychological and
TSQM Global Satisfaction scores than patients in the
low-adherence group. Although the other TSQM
scores did show improvements in mean with increased
adherence, the trends were not statistically significant.
No statistically significant relationships were seen
between adherence and the number of relapses or
MOS cognitive function.
Discussion
In this population of patients with MS in a large inte-
grated health system, we observed very high levels of
MS medication adherence overall and no strong asso-
ciations between the degree of adherence and hospital
admissions or ED use. Patients with low adherence
had higher hospital-related costs but significantly
lower mean total costs than patients with intermediate
or high adherence, presumably due to more outpatient
visits and pharmacologic utilization by patients in the
higher-adherence groups. Patients with high adherence
to MS medications fared better on MS-specific mea-
sures: on average, they had significantly better EDSS
scores, MS impact scores (physical and psychological),

a Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Cognitive Functioning Scale of 0-60, with higher scores reflecting better function. Treatment Satisfaction
Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) scores range from 0-100, with 100 being the best score. Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale
(EDSS) is scored on a 0-10 scale, with 10 being the worst. Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS) includes both physical and psychological
subscales that are scored on a scale of 0-100, with 100 being the worst score. Because outcomes were not expected to be normally
distributed, all variables were compared among 3 self-reported adherence (SRA) groups and 95% CIs were generated using nonparametric
bootstrapping as described in the text. Significant differences in mean from the SRA <80% group were determined.

 and treatment satisfaction scores than patients with low
adherence.
Previous research has shown positive relationships
between adherence and outcomes and negative relation-
ships between adherence and health care utilization in
patients with MS or other diseases.21,22 The current
study findings show positive effects of adherence on
MS-specific functional outcomes. Patients in the low-
adherence group had statistically significantly worse
EDSS and MSIS scores than patients in the higher-
adherence groups, supporting the idea that medication
adherence in this population improves MS-specific out-
comes that are not easily captured in the EHR or claims
databases. We recognize, however, that the differences
in EDSS scores observed, though statistically signifi-
cant, may not be clinically significant. Another import-
ant finding was that highly adherent patients had the
highest scores on the TSQM Global Satisfaction scale,
showing patients’ satisfaction with their medication.
The causality of this relationship is unknown from the
data—eg, the patients could have been more satisfied
because their medication was working, or the patients
could have been more adherent because they felt satis-
fied with their treatment—but the association is strong.
In contrast to the MS disease-specific outcome mea-
sures, we did not see stronger evidence of a positive
impact of adherence on health care utilization or cost
that had been observed in previous literature on medica-
tion adherence.21,23 Previous studies of antihyperten-
sive medication adherence, for example, have shown
significantly lower health care costs and lower risk of
hospitalization with increased adherence.10 Yermakov
et al22 examined 1510 patients in a large claims data-
base and found 9% to 19% reductions in the risk of
hospitalization or ED visit and a very modest (3%-5%)
reduction in costs associated with a 10% point increase
in adherence; they did not define a threshold for desir-
able adherence or assess patient-reported outcomes,
however. We expected to see similar trends but did
not, which may be owing to our smaller sample size or
differences in population. Our data did show a negative
association between adherence and MS-related hospita-
lizations and ED visits, as well as higher hospital-
related costs in patients with low adherence, but these
associations were not statistically significant. Patients
with low adherence had significantly lower mean total
costs than patients with higher adherence, presumably
because of more outpatient visits and medication costs.
This finding is consistent with previous literature sug-
gesting that the cost savings from reduced hospitaliza-
tions in higher-adherence patients may be balanced by
an increased pharmacy expenditure.24 Unexpected find-
ings in the intermediate-adherence group were that
these patients had higher mean outpatient and total
costs—both for all-cause and MS-related care—than
either the low- or high-adherence groups. This finding
suggests that the relationship between medication
adherence and health care utilization by patients with
MS may be more complex than a simple positive or
negative association. This information may help the
medical community by providing a slightly different
spin on how we view the management of chronic
disease in disciplines that prescribe medications
similar to those used for MS, such as rheumatology.
The vast majority of patients in both the retrospective
and prospective portions of the study had very high
adherence that exceeded the 80% benchmark tradition-
ally used for other diseases. We hypothesize that this
high adherence is not unique to an integrated health
system population but instead reflects the difference
between MS (where consequences of nonadherence
may directly manifest as relapses) and other diseases for
which medication adherence has been studied (eg, blood
pressure or lipid-lowering medications where the effects
of nonadherence may take longer to observe).2 These
data would suggest that it may be important to define dif-
ferent thresholds for adherence when studying different
diseases, as 80% adherence may be clinically important
or remarkable for one disease state but not for another.
The primary strength of our study was the 2-pronged
approach of the design, which leveraged both adminis-
trative records and direct patient contact to examine
relationships between medication adherence, outcomes,
and health care utilization. Traditional data sources

 combined with self-reported outcomes allowed us to
examine adherence-related clinical manifestations of
MS as well as to estimate the quantitative impact on
health care utilization and costs.
Limitations of the study included the relatively small
sample size in a single health system. Ironically, the
large number of patients with high adherence was detri-
mental to the statistical power of the study; because
18% of the retrospective cohort patients had poor
adherence instead of the 40% we anticipated, our
power to conclude statistical significance from the dif-
ferences observed was greatly diminished. We acknow-
ledge that MS is a long-term, progressive disease, and
most patients were observed for 12 months, which
limits the conclusions we can draw about long-term
outcomes. Our regional population is also predomin-
antly white, and so caveats regarding generalizability
to other more diverse populations apply. We recognize
that the patient-reported relapse rate in the prospective
survey study could have incorrectly estimated the true
rate. Also, during the study period (2010-2014), most
therapy options were injectable, and adherence trends
may have evolved now that more oral medications
have become available.
Conclusion
Adherence to MS medications was very high overall in
our samples. High adherence was reflected both in
claims-based measures and SRAs, suggesting that
either method of assessing adherence yields reasonably
consistent information. Medications that are designed to
promote adherence by virtue of their route (eg, oral
over injectable), dosing regimen (eg, single dose over
multiple doses), and price (affordable) should help to
significantly improve symptoms and functioning for
patients with MS. Decision-makers in the health care
system and the health insurance industry should be
aware that although patients with MS are mostly adher-
ent to their existing treatments, adherence affects symp-
toms but does not necessarily reduce health care
utilization or costs in the short term. However, there
was some evidence of lower hospitalization costs
related to higher adherence, but it did not reach statis-
tical significance. Future research following the
methods outlined in the current study but using claims
from multiple centers, and thus a larger population,
could examine these relationships further.
