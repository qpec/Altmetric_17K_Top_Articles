Every cancer originates from a single cell. During expansion of the neoplastic cell population, individual cells acquire 
genetic and phenotypic differences from each other. Here, to investigate the nature and extent of intra-tumour 
diversification, we characterized organoids derived from multiple single cells from three colorectal cancers as well as 
from adjacent normal intestinal crypts. Colorectal cancer cells showed extensive mutational diversification and carried 
several times more somatic mutations than normal colorectal cells. Most mutations were acquired during the final 
dominant clonal expansion of the cancer and resulted from mutational processes that are absent from normal colorectal 
cells. Intra-tumour diversification of DNA methylation and transcriptome states also occurred; these alterations were 
cell-autonomous, stable, and followed the phylogenetic tree of each cancer. There were marked differences in responses 
to anticancer drugs between even closely related cells of the same tumour. The results indicate that colorectal cancer 
cells experience substantial increases in somatic mutation rate compared to normal colorectal cells, and that genetic 
diversification of each cancer is accompanied by pervasive, stable and inherited differences in the biological states of 
individual cancer cells.
Recent studies have explored genetic diversification within cancer 
cell populations by identifying mutations shared by subpopulations 
of cells within the cancer clone1–6. In principle, however, the extent 
of intra-tumour genetic diversity is most comprehensively revealed 
by single-cancer-cell DNA sequencing, which can potentially iden-
tify all mutations, including those that arose in the distant past, those 
that occurred very recently, and those not present in any other cell7,8. 
Despite recent advances, however, single-cell genome sequencing 
remains dependent on prior whole-genome amplification, which is 
associated with incomplete genome coverage and artefactual muta-
tions9. Diversification of epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and 
metabolic states, and of functional states such as resistance to antican-
cer therapy, may also occur during expansion of the neoplastic cell 
population10–13. Methylation, gene expression and drug response data 
have previously been obtained from multiple cells from individual 
tumours, but the collection of all these features together with accurate 
genome information from the same single cells has not been reported, 
to our knowledge14–19. The origins of epigenomic and transcriptomic 
diversification are unclear, and there is little insight into whether these 
are transient or stable.
One experimental approach that enables comprehensive, systematic 
and integrated exploration of intra-tumour diversification is to derive 
immortal cell lines from multiple single cells from the same cancer20. 
These serve as proxies for the single cells from which they originate and 
can be subjected to extensive and multimodal characterization, thereby 
revealing all aspects of intra-tumour diversification retained during 
in vitro growth. We have recently developed protocols for derivation 
of clonal organoids from normal and neoplastic colorectal stem cells, 
and we use this strategy here to compare single cells from normal and 
neoplastic colorectal epithelium21–24.
Comparison of the number of mutations in single cancer cell 
genomes with that in individual normal cells from the same tissue may 
also reveal whether alterations in somatic mutation rate and mutational 
process have been experienced by neoplastic cells. Substantial increases 
in mutation rate are known to occur during the development of cancers 
with DNA mismatch repair deficiency or mutations in genes encoding 
DNA polymerases25. Whether mutation rate increases are common 
in cancers without these specific abnormalities is, however, currently 
unknown and a matter of controversy26–30.
Clonal organoid derivation
Colorectal cancers from three previously untreated individuals (P1, 
P2 and P3) were each dissected into 4–6 pieces (Extended Data Fig. 1). 
Organoid cultures were derived from cell suspensions made separately 
from each piece and were maintained for up to one week without pas-
sage. Subsequently, individual organoids were disaggregated and flow-
sorted to obtain single cells from which clonal cancer organoids were 
established. For each individual, organoids were also derived from 
single crypts in normal colorectal epithelium from the same resection 
specimens. A crypt derives from a single stem cell that has been esti-
mated to exist several months before crypt isolation24,31.
The coding regions of 360 known cancer genes were sequenced in 
all normal and cancer-derived clonal organoids for likely driver muta-
tions and a subset were whole-genome sequenced. Somatic mutations

were identified by comparison with the sequences of DNA extracted 
from pieces of normal colorectal tissue. The overwhelming majority 
of somatic mutations identified in this way are likely to have occurred 
in vivo and not during in vitro culture (Extended Data Fig. 2c). Clonal 
organoids were also subjected to analysis of DNA methylation state at 
470,000 CpG sites, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and were assessed for 
response to several anticancer therapeutics.
Phylogenetic trees of somatic mutations
Using the catalogues of somatic mutations from clonal organoids, 
we derived cell phylogenetic trees for each individual (Fig. 1a–c and 
Extended Data Figs. 3–6). The structures of the trees generally reca-
pitulated the geographic origins of the clonal organoids within each 
cancer, with more closely related branches originating from the same 
tumour pieces. However, organoids within each piece continued to 
exhibit extensive genetic diversification: for example, in organoid clones 
isolated from tumour section P3.T3, at least 40% of mutations were 
not shared with other clones from this piece (Extended Data Fig. 1o).
In the trunk of the cancer cell phylogenetic tree of P1, we identi-
fied likely driver mutations in BRAF (V600E), PIK3CA (E81K) and 
ACVR2A (protein-truncating small indel). All cancer clones from this 
individual also showed microsatellite instability characteristic of DNA 
mismatch repair deficiency and hypermethylation of the MLH1 pro-
moter (the likely cause of this instability) (Extended Data Fig. 7). In 
addition, there were likely driver truncating mutations in PTEN and 
RNF43 that were restricted to subsets of branches of the tree. In P2, 
two protein-truncating APC mutations and a homozygous splice site 
TP53 mutation were present in the cancer trunk. In P3, a KRAS muta-
tion (A146T) and two truncating APC mutations were present in the 
 
cancer trunk, and a TP53 in-frame deletion was present in a subset of 
the branches. No driver mutations or MLH1 methylation were observed 
in clonal organoids derived from normal colon epithelium from the 
three patients.
Mutation load in normal and cancer cells
A mean of 3,792 base substitutions was found in normal organoid 
clones derived from P1, 3,172 from P2 and 3,621 from P3 (Fig. 2), 
as previously reported24. The mean number of base substitutions in 
cancer-derived clones was higher in all three individuals: 72,398 in P1, 
22,291 in P2 and 14,209 in P3. There were also substantial differences in 
the number of small indels and genome rearrangements. A mean of 227 
small indels was observed in clones derived from normal colorectal epi-
thelium from P1, 130 from P2 and 167 from P3. By comparison, the mean 
number of indels was 27,893 in cancer clones from P1, 1,485 from P2 
and 2,021 from P3. There was a mean of one genome rearrangement in 
clonal organoids derived from normal colorectal epithelial cells contrast-
ing with means in cancer-derived clonal organoids of 71 rearrangements 
from P1, 176 from P2 and 67 from P3. As the normal and cancer clones 
are derived from cells obtained from each individual at the same times, 
increases in somatic base substitution, small indel and genome rear-
rangement mutation rates are likely to have occurred in the lineages from 
fertilized egg to cancer cell, including in the two cancers that were pro-
ficient in DNA mismatch repair. Most of the additional mutation loads 
in cancer cells were acquired in the branches of the cancer phylogenetic 
 
tree rather than the trunk and therefore occurred following the last 
 
dominant clonal expansion within the cancer cell population.
Mutational signatures
We extracted mutational signatures and estimated the contributions of 
each signature to each segment of the phylogenetic trees. Eight base sub-
stitution mutational signatures were found (referred to according to the 
nomenclature in COSMIC http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures).

Fig. 1 | Mutation patterns during colorectal cancer evolution. 
Multiregion sampling of each colorectal cancer is illustrated by coloured 
labels (T) and normal tissue sampling by white labels (N). Phylogenetic 
trees from three individuals have been constructed using somatic 
mutations in clonal colorectal organoids derived from normal and cancer 
cells. Organoids underwent whole-genome sequencing (circles) or 
targeted cancer gene panel sequencing (triangles). The lengths of branches 
are proportional to mutation numbers and each mutation type and 
mutation signature is indicated by a different colour. Driver mutations and 
a whole genome duplication (WGD) are indicated in the phylogenetic tree.

These include the previously described signatures 1, 5, 6, 17, 18, 20 
and 26 and a signature that has not been previously encountered32  
(see also Supplementary Notes section 5). Each mutational signa-
ture can be regarded as the outcome of a mutational process, which 
includes components of DNA damage or modification, DNA repair 
(or absence of it) and DNA replication, with each component poten-
tially influencing the profile of the signature. Signature 1 is likely to 
result from deamination of 5-methylcytosine to thymine and has 
been reported to act in a ‘clock-like’ manner, with mutations accu-
mulated continuously over the lifetime of an individual at differ-
ent rates in different tissues. The number of signature 1 mutations 
is proposed to correlate with the number of mitotic divisions33. 
Signature 5 is of uncertain origin and also shows accumulation of 
mutations in a clock-like manner, with different rates in different tis-
sues, although the rates do not correlate with those of signature 133. 
 
Signatures 1 and 5 are found in most human cancers and probably 
in most normal cells24,33.
Signature 1 dominated and, with signature 5, accounted for the 
large majority of mutations in normal colorectal stem cells24 (Fig. 1). 
Signature 1 also dominated in the trunks of the cancer phylogenetic 
trees, presumably reflecting, at least in part, the long segment of 
normal cell lineage from the fertilized egg to the cell in which the 
first cancer driver mutation was acquired. However, in each of the 
three cancer trunks, signatures 17 and/or 18 also showed contribu-
tions (which were not detectable in the normal clonal organoids). 
Signatures 17 and 18 have been found in many cancer types and have 
uncertain mechanisms, although signature 18 may be related to DNA 
damage induced by reactive oxygen species and/or by deficiency of 
base excision repair.
A different pattern of signature contributions was seen in the 
branches of the three cancer phylogenetic trees (Fig. 1). In P1, the 
mutations were predominantly of signatures 6, 20, 26 and indels; in 
P2, signatures 5, 17, 18, and indels; and in P3, signatures 5, 18, indels 
and a new signature predominantly characterized by T > G, T > A and 
T > C mutations at NTA and NTT trinucleotides (the mutated base is 
underlined; Extended Data Fig. 2d). The last signature occurred in all 
clones carrying a small in-frame deletion in TP53, but its relationship 
to this putative driver mutation is unknown. With regard to structural 
changes, P1 cancer clones carried deletions, inversions and tandem 
duplications, but few translocations, and their copy number profiles 
were relatively flat (Fig. 1 and Extended Data Figs. 5, 6). P2 cancer 
clones carried all types of rearrangement accompanied by changes in 
copy number profiles. In P3, TP53 mutant clones carried abundant 
rearrangements of all types resulting in aberrant copy number states, 
whereas rearrangements were approximately tenfold less common in 
TP53 wild-type clones with few copy number changes. The numbers of

mutations of several signatures differed markedly between individual 
branches, indicating varying contributions of mutational processes in 
different parts of the cancer.
There were more signature 1 mutations in each cancer organoid than 
in normal organoids from the same individuals (Fig. 1 and Extended 
Data Fig. 2e). Assuming that the clock-like correlation between the 
number of signature 1 mutations and number of mitoses undergone 
in normal cells is maintained at the same rate during neoplastic cell 
proliferation, we estimate that cancer cells from individual P1 have 
undergone 1.9 (± 0.5) (s.d.) times as many mitoses as normal cells, 
cancer cells from individual P2 2.5 (± 0.2) times as many, and from 
individual P3 1.7 (± 0.2) times as many. An alternative explanation for 
the increase in signature 1 mutations in cancer cells is increased DNA 
methylation in cancer cells. However, cancer organoids were generally 
hypomethylated compared to normal cells (Extended Data Fig. 8b). In 
the distal branches of the phylogenetic trees (that is, during the most 
recent phases of cancer growth) the base substitution mutation rates per 
mitosis (as estimated by the total number of mutations divided by the 
number of signature 1 mutations) were markedly increased compared 
to normal cells (estimated 100-fold in P1, which is DNA mismatch- 
repair deficient, and tenfold in P2 and P3, which are mismatch-repair 
proficient). Thus, assuming that these estimates of past mitoses under-
gone are correct, the increases in base substitution, indel and genome 
rearrangement mutation rates over time also represent increases in 
mutation rates per mitosis.
Methylome and transcriptome
Epigenetic changes may be part of, and contribute to, the biological 
diversification of intra-tumour cell populations. To explore this possi-
bility, we examined the methylation status of 470,000 CpG sites in the 
normal and tumour-derived clonal organoids. Organoids derived from 
normal stem cells from P1, P2 and P3 clustered together in principal 
component analyses, albeit with normal clones from each individual 
closer to each other than to normal clones from other individuals (Fig. 3 
and Extended Data Fig. 8a). Clonal organoids from each colorectal 
 
cancer clustered together, with the exception of the two TP53 wild-type 
clones of P3, but separately from those derived from the other cancers 
and from normal organoids. Thus, the methylation states of normal 
colorectal stem cells from different individuals were relatively similar, 
but tumours from different individuals had developed divergent epige-
netic states. For the P1 tumour, this conformed to the pattern of global 
hypermethylation previously termed CpG island methylator pheno-
type (CIMP)25. To investigate intra-tumour diversification of transcrip-
tome state, we performed RNA-seq of normal colorectal epithelium 
and cancer-derived organoid clones. Clustering by gene expression 
profiles correlated well with clustering by methylation, with normal 
organoids from all individuals clustering together, while separate clus-
ters existed for each cancer (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 9a). For 
each cancer we constructed phylogenetic trees based on methylation 
and gene expression (Fig. 3c). The topologies of the methylation and 
expression trees were remarkably similar to the mutation-based trees. 
Thus, diversification of methylation and transcriptome state occurred 
within each cancer and this was apparently heritable, stable and inde-
pendent of the tumour microenvironment, as it persisted after organoid 
culture in vitro.
Diversification of drug responses
The clonal cancer organoids were exposed in vitro to a set of drugs used 
 
to treat colorectal cancer, including the chemotherapeutic agents 5- 
fluorouracil (5-FU), doxorubicin and 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin 
 
(SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan), and the targeted agents 
afatinib (an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor), 
 
nutlin-3a (a stabilizer of TP53), a MEK1/2 inhibitor and an AKT inhibitor. 
 
Different organoids from the same cancer displayed substantial and 
reproducible differences in IC50 values of up to 1,000-fold (Fig. 4 and 
Extended Data Fig. 10a, b), for both chemotherapeutic agents and 
targeted therapies. Some differences were attributable to particular 
somatic mutations. Notably, nutlin-3a exerted much greater growth

inhibition of TP53 wild-type than mutant clones in P3 tumour orga-
noids. Additionally, truncating mutations in RNF43, a recessive 
cancer gene encoding a negative regulator of the WNT pathway34, 
rendered cells highly sensitive to the WNT secretion/porcupine 
inhibitor IWP2 (Extended Data Fig. 10c). The remaining variation 
in drug response did not, however, clearly relate to the geographical 
zones of origin or to the phylogenetic trees of each cancer. There were 
several examples of marked differences in drug sensitivity between 
closely related clones. For example, P2.T4.1 showed marked resist-
ance to SN-38 compared to the other P2.T4 clones, whereas P3.T1.5 
showed distinct sensitivity to 5-FU compared to all other clones from 
this individual (Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 10a). The mechanism 
underlying this diversification in biological behaviour is unclear, 
but there was no obvious correlation with the degree of mutational 
diversification.
Discussion
Previous studies have addressed particular aspects of intra-cancer 
diversification by profiling the transcriptome, DNA copy number state 
and functional responses of individual cells14–16,35. To our knowledge, 
this is the first systematic and integrated analysis at genetic, epigenetic, 
transcriptomic and functional levels of multiple single-cell-derived 
clones from human cancers to incorporate high-quality and com-
prehensive description of essentially all somatic mutations present in 
multiple single cells. All three cancers studied, including the two DNA 
mismatch-repair proficient cases, clearly exhibited higher mutation 
burdens than normal colorectal stem cells. These are likely to result 
from increased mutation rates experienced during the lineages from 
fertilized egg to colorectal cancer cell. More comparisons of normal 
and colorectal cancer cells, and similar comparisons for other classes of 
cancer, are required for corroboration but it seems likely that increases 
in somatic mutation rates are common during the development of 
human cancers. These increases are predominantly due to recruit-
ment of mutational processes that are inactive or marginally active in 
normal cells, and which dominate at later stages in the evolution of 
the cancer cell population. The roles of these processes in generating 
driver mutations, however, are unclear, as they may have started before 
or after acquisition of the early driver mutations in the trunks of the 
cancer phylogenetic trees5. The mechanisms underlying the increases 
in mutation rate in the DNA mismatch-repair proficient cancers are, 
for the most part, unknown. These increases may be due to somatic 
genetic or epigenetic changes (although these are not currently obvi-
ous), to metabolic stress attendant upon the elevated mitotic rate and 
other features of the neoplastic state, or to effects of the cancer cell 
microenvironment. Alongside intra-tumour mutational diversifi-
cation, diversification of methylation state, transcriptome state and 
biological responses to therapeutics occur. While some methylation 
and transcriptome changes that occurred in vivo may have been lost 
during in vitro growth we were able to capture methylation and tran-
scriptome changes that followed the evolution of the cancer through 
the mutational phylogenetic tree, which appeared to be stable and, at 
least partly, independent of the tumour cell microenvironment, as they 
persisted after cells were removed from the tumour. Diversification 
of methylation and transcriptome states and of drug responses are 
likely to result partly from driver mutations in cancer genes, but other, 
currently unknown, genetic and/or epigenetic mechanisms may be 
involved36. Future studies analysing the genomes, methylomes and 
transcriptomes of primary cells of a cancer will be needed to reveal all 
genetic, epigenetic and transcriptional variation occurring between 
cancer cells in vivo. Nevertheless, this study has shown the strength 
of the organoid system in stably retaining these characteristics and 
enabling functional assays on clones derived from individual cells. 
The analysis indicates that all three colorectal cancers contained cells 
resistant to most of the drugs commonly used to treat the disease. 
Differential drug responses between clones that are closely related both 
genetically and epigenetically suggest that resistance mechanisms can 
arise late in tumorigenesis.

MEthodS
Human tissues. Tissue material was obtained from The Diakonessen Hospital, 
Utrecht. From the resected colon segment, both normal and tumour tissues were 
isolated. The isolated tumour tissue was subdivided into 4–5 segments. Normal 
tissue was taken at least 5 cm away from the tumour. All samples were obtained 
with informed consent and the study was approved by the ethical committee of 
The Diakonessen Hospital, Utrecht.
No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments 
were not randomized and the investigators were not blinded to allocation during 
experiments and outcome assessment.
Human organoid culture. Human normal and tumour colon organoids were 
established and maintained as described from isolated colonic epithelium21,22. 
In brief, long-term normal colonic organoid culture required human intestinal 
stem cell medium (HISM) composed of advanced DMEM/F12 (AdMEM) with 
penicillin/streptomycin, 10 mM HEPES, 1×
GlutaMAX, 1×
B27 (Invitrogen) and 
1 µ
M N-acetylcysteine (SIGMA), supplemented with 50 ng ml−
1 human recom-
binant EGF (Peprotech), 0.5 µ
M A83-01 (Tocris), 3 µ
M SB202190 (SIGMA), 1 µ
M 
nicotinamide (SIGMA), 10 nM prostaglandin E2,Wnt3A-conditioned medium 
(CM) (50% final concentration), Noggin-CM (10% final concentration), and 
R-Spondin1-CM (10% final concentration). Tumour organoids were cultured in 
medium containing only EGF, Noggin-CM, R-Spondin1-CM and A83-01.
Establishment of clonal organoids. For clonal organoids from normal crypts, iso-
lated single crypts were embedded in 10 µ
l Matrigel and cultured in HISM medium. 
For clonal tumour organoid cultures, tumour cell suspensions were cultured for 
7–14 days in HISM without Wnt3A-CM. Then, 10–15 individual organoids were 
picked and separately dissociated into single cells by TryPLE express (Thermo 
Fisher), washed and suspended in AdMEM containing propidium iodide (PI). 
Forty-eight single cells were sorted into tumour organoid medium (HISM plus 10 
µ
M ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (Tocris BioScience); no Wnt-CM) from each tumour 
organoid. Sorting was based on FCS area/FCS peak and PIneg/FCS area using a 
Moflo machine (Beckman Coulter). Sorted cells were spun down at 1,000g at 4 °C 
for 5 min, after which single cells were each embedded into 10 µ
l of basement 
membrane extract (BME, Amsbio) and seeded into 96-well plates at a ratio of 
1 cell per well. The gel was left to solidify in a 37 °C incubator after HISM (no 
Wnt3A-CM) was added. Y-27632 was added to the medium for the first week after 
sorting. For each original tumour organoid, a single clonal organoid was selected 
and expanded for further study and for preparing frozen stocks. Culturing times 
and plating efficiencies are listed for each organoid in Supplementary Datafile S1.
Histology procedures. Tissues were fixed in 4% formaldehyde solution overnight 
and embedded in paraffin. Sections were subjected to haematoxylin and eosin 
(H&E) and immunohistochemistry staining. The Ki67 antibody (MONX10283, 
Monosan) was used at 1:250 dilution.
Organoid CellTiter-Glo viability assay. Tumour organoids were cultured for 5–10 
days after being trypsinized into single cells in HISM without Wnt-3a-CM. The 
organoids were mechanically dissociated by pipetting before being resuspended 
in 5% BME/growth medium (25 ×
 103 organoids per ml). Before seeding, 10 µ
l 
BME was dispensed into 384-well plates, and then 30 µ
l growth medium containing 
organoids was dispensed into each plate (at about 750 organoids per well. Drug 
screening was carried out using nutlin-3a, afatinib, MEK1/2 inhibitor III, AKT 
inhibitor VIII, 5-FU, doxorubicin, and SN-38. Drug dilutions were performed in 
two series: 1) stepwise 2 fold-dilutions from 20 µ
M to 19.5 nM; and 2) stepwise 2 
fold-dilutions from 15 µ
M to 29.3 nM. The measurements for these two dilution 
series were combined into a single curve. All drugs were dispensed by a HP-D300 
automated liquid dispenser (TECAN). Samples were incubated for 6 days at 37 °C, 
and cell viability was measured by CellTiter-Glo 3D kit (Promega) on a SpectraMax 
M5e (Molecular Devices). Cell viability measurements were performed in duplicate 
wells for each clone. Survival ratios in drug-treated organoids were normalized 
to the average survival in a DMSO control. Each experiment was repeated on a 
different day. To assess variability between technical and biological replicates we 
calculated the area under the curve (AUC) for each survival curve. AUC values 
are calculated using the trapezoid method and are divided by the area covered by 
100% survival on the y-axis and the range of the log10 concentrations on the x-axis 
(Extended Data Fig. 10b).
DNA and RNA extraction. DNA and RNA were concomitantly extracted from 
frozen tissue samples or organoid cultures using AllPrep DNA/RNA minikit 
(Qiagen 80204).
Whole-genome sequencing. From each individual, 7–10 tumour-derived clones 
were selected for whole-genome sequencing (WGS), as well as 4–5 normal-derived 
clones. We generated paired end sequencing reads (150 bp) using Illumina XTEN 
machines, resulting in ± 30×
 coverage per sample. Sequences were aligned to the 
human reference genome (NCBI build37) using BWA-MEM. Sequencing statistics 
are listed in Supplementary Datafile S2.
Cancer gene panel sequencing. All WGS sequenced clones and 40 additional 
tumour-derived clones were subjected to targeted sequencing. An in-house 
 
developed cancer gene panel (CGPv3) was used, designed to pull down 360 genes 
that are known or suspected to play a role in cancer3,37. The panel targets genes 
from the Cancer Gene Census (COSMIC), genes recurrently amplified or over-
expressed in cancer and candidate cancer genes such as kinases from the MAP 
kinase signalling pathway. We performed custom RNA bait design following the 
manufacturer’s guidelines (SureSelect, Agilent) and previously described work-
flows to create pulldown libraries from native genomic DNA3,37. Samples were 
multiplexed on flow cells and subjected to paired end sequencing (75-bp reads) 
using Illumina HiSeq2000 machines, resulting in more than 700×
 coverage for 
the target design for tumour-derived samples and more than 2,000×
 coverage for 
normal tissue-derived samples. Sequences were aligned to the human reference 
genome (NCBI build37) using BWA-align.
RNA sequencing. From each individual, RNA was isolated from all tumour 
and normal derived organoid clones and subjected to RNA-seq analysis. RNA-
seq libraries were prepared according to previously described workflows and 
sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2000 machines38. Between four and seven barcoded 
samples were pooled per library. Sequenced reads were aligned to the human ref-
erence genome (NCBI build37) with Bowtie/TopHat.
Methylation arrays. Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays were used 
to characterize the methylation status of more than 450,000 CpG sites for all clones.
Mutation discovery. All somatic changes in whole genome and targeted data were 
analysed with mutation calling pipelines developed in house (available at https://
github.com/cancerit).
Substitutions. Single-base somatic substitutions were identified using CaVEMan39 
and a number of post-processing filters were applied. For each patient, the only 
germline reference available was healthy colorectal tissue more than 5 cm from the 
tumour, consisting of epithelial and connective tissue. In order to allow the discov-
ery of a field effect40,41 that might have spread into the matched normal sample, 
we ran CaVEMan using an unmatched normal reference. Germline SNPs were 
removed by comparison to a panel of 75 unrelated normal samples. Additional 
post-processing filters were applied to these mutation calls as described42. For 
XTEN/BWA-mem aligned data we added two filters to the pipeline for the median 
alignment score (ASMD) ≥
 140 and the clipping index (CLPM) = 0, meaning that 
fewer than half of the reads should be clipped.
We then tabulated the number of mutant and wild-type reads for every mutation 
discovered in every sample, including the adjacent colorectal tissue. We considered 
only mutations that were covered by ten reads in all related clones, and mutations 
that were seen on at least two reads in each direction. As the adjacent normal 
colorectal tissue is not entirely composed of epithelium we reasoned that if there 
were a field effect the somatic mutations in this tissue should not be fully clonal. 
We therefore deducted germline mutations on the basis that they were fully clonal 
in the bulk normal, while mutations that were subclonal in the bulk were not 
removed from the analysis. To define a mutation as subclonal in the bulk, the 
probability of finding the observed number of mutant reads or fewer given the 
sequencing coverage had to be less than 0.005, based on the binomial distribution 
with a probability of 0.5 for autosomes. Mutations that failed to meet this criterion 
were considered to be germline and were removed.
Indels. Indels were called using Pindel43,44 using the adjacent bulk colorectal tissue 
as a matched normal. Post processing filters were the same as for substitutions 
except that ASMD ≥
 140 and CLPM = 0 were not used.
Copy number. Copy number profiles were constructed for WGS samples by 
ASCAT45,46, using adjacent healthy colorectal tissue as a matched normal. Copy 
number profiles of WGS analysed samples were visualized with the plotHeatmap 
function of the R package ‘copynumber’47.
Rearrangements. Rearrangements were called using healthy adjacent colorectal 
tissue as a matched normal. Abnormally paired read pairs from WGS were grouped 
and filtered by read remapping using ‘Brass’ (https://github.com/cancerit/BRASS). 
Read pair clusters with 50% or more of the reads mapping to microbial sequences 
were removed. Candidate breakpoints were matched to copy number breakpoints 
defined by ASCAT within 10 kb. Rearrangements not associated with copy number 
breakpoints or with a copy number change of less than 0.3 were removed.
Phylogenetic tree construction. The phylogeny of single-cell-derived organoids for 
each patient was constructed from substitutions called in WGS data. For each 
patient, substitutions that had been discovered by CaVEMan in any organoid from 
that patient were called as present or absent in each organoid using the algorithm 
Shearwater48. This algorithm compares allele frequencies of variants to a back-
ground error model derived from sequencing thousands of samples from unrelated 
studies on the same platform. Sequencing errors are known to occur at different 
frequencies across different sites of the genome48. By obtaining a comprehensive 
view of the number of variant calls at each position in unrelated normal genomes, 
we built an error model for each nucleotide change for each position. This method 
has previously been used to find variants at a low frequency49. Here, we com-
pared the observed frequency of each variant to our error model. After correcting 
for multiple testing, only variants that were significantly mutated over the error

model were kept, using a q value cutoff of 0.05. Although most true variants largely 
exceed this threshold, this procedure maximizes the chance of retaining variants in 
genomic regions that have undergone copy number changes, lowering the appar-
ent variant allele fraction (VAF), since the Shearwater algorithm was designed to 
detect subclonal variants. As a further stringent filter to minimise false positive 
calls, variants had to be supported by at least three mutant reads to be considered 
by the algorithm. In this way every mutation called in an individual was genotyped 
as being present or absent in each sample. Phylogenies were constructed using this 
binary matrix of mutations present or absent in each sample. Private mutations 
were discarded from tree building as they are uninformative. A fake outgroup 
with no mutations called was generated for each individual. Phylogenies were 
constructed using the Phylip suite of tools50. The programme seqboot was used 
to generate 100 bootstrap replicates of each dataset by resampling the mutations 
with replacement. Phylogenies were then reconstructed for each bootstrap replicate 
by maximum parsimony using the Mix programme using the Wagner method, 
using the fake outgroup as a root. The jumble = 10 option was used, randomizing 
the order of the input samples 10 times for each bootstrap replicate. Finally, the 
programme Consense was used to build a consensus of all the trees that had been 
built for each patient, using the majority rule (extended) option. This reports, for 
each node in the most parsimonious tree, how many of the trees that had been built 
contain a node that partitions the samples into the same two groups. All nodes in 
each tree that relate tumour samples to each other were supported by all bootstrap 
replicates (Supplementary Notes).
Assignment of somatic changes in WGS to the phylogenetic tree. Substitutions. 
Substitutions were called as present or absent in each organoid as described above. 
To assign these mutations to the tree, each branch of the tree was considered in 
turn. If a mutation was called in all the organoids that were descendants of a given 
branch, and in no organoids that were not descendants of the branch, muta-
tions were assigned to that branch. Ignoring private mutations, which necessarily 
fit any tree, 97.7% of shared mutations fitted the tree structure from patient 1 
 
perfectly, 89.7% fitted the tree from patient 2 perfectly, and 88.1% fitted the tree 
from patient 3 perfectly. The lower concordance with the tree for patients 2 and 3 
reflects the increased copy number changes that have occurred in these phylog-
enies. Examination of the copy number state at loci where there were discordant 
mutations showed that the majority could be explained by deletions of those 
mutations in a subclone. Substitutions that did not fit the tree perfectly were 
therefore assigned to the most recent common ancestor of the samples in which 
they were called.
All substitution calls and their assignment to branches of the tree, as well as 
substitutions that did not fit the tree perfectly and their associated copy number 
states are listed in Supplementary Data file S4.
Indels. Indels were called as being present or absent in each sample based on a 
variant allele fraction (the proportion of mutant reads at a locus) cutoff. The 
variant allele fraction cutoff was chosen for each patient based on a histogram of 
the variant allele fraction to separate the sequencing noise distribution from the 
distribution of true mutations. Variant allele fraction cutoffs were chosen as 0.15 
for patients 1 and 3, and 0.11 for patient 2. Indels were then assigned to branches 
of the tree that they fitted perfectly. Indels that were assigned to the tree, along 
with their assignments, as well as indels that did not fit the tree are provided in 
Supplementary Data file S4.
Rearrangements. The same rearrangement may be called in related samples with 
slightly different breakpoints. To identify rearrangements that had been sequenced 
in related clones as the same, both the upstream and the downstream breakpoints 
had to fall within 500 bp of each other. The majority of rearrangements fitted the 
tree. Visualization of discordant rearrangements using IGV51 showed that often an 
overlapping rearrangement meant that the rearrangement was lost in a clone. All 
rearrangement calls that could and could not be assigned to the tree can be found 
in Supplementary Data file S4.
Timing substitutions and indels relative to a whole genome duplication (WGD). A 
whole genome duplication was observed in the trunk of the tumour for patient 2.
Substitutions. For substitutions, we aimed first to obtain an accurate estimate 
of the timing of WGD in molecular time, and second to time as many substi-
tutions as possible relative to the WGD in order to perform signature analysis 
on them.
To obtain an estimate of the timing of the WGD, we examined substitutions 
in regions with two copies of one allele and none of the other (as determined by 
ASCAT). In these regions, if a mutation occurred before the WGD on that allele, 
it will be at copy number 2. If it occurred afterwards, it will be at copy number 1. 
One hundred and eighty substitutions occurred at copy number 2, and 67 at copy 
number 1. As at least half of the mutations that occurred before the WGD have 
been lost in such regions (as there is loss of one allele), the WGD can be estimated 
to have occurred at 84% ((180 ×
 2)/(180 ×
 2 + 67)) of molecular time in the trunk 
of the tumour (95% confidence interval of 80.8–87.6% calculated by bootstrapping 
10,000 times).
Second, we wanted to time substitutions in regions with a greater range of copy 
number states for mutational signature analysis. To do this, for every truncal sub-
stitution in every tumour clone from patient 2, the copy number segment (as called 
by ASCAT) in which that mutation fell was defined. Mutations could be timed only 
in samples in which there was a minor copy number of 0 and a major copy number 
greater than 1. Fortunately, because of the extensive copy number changes in this 
tumour, all mutations fell in a region that met these criteria in at least one sample. 
For a given mutation that fell in such a copy number segment in a given sample, the 
VAF in that sample of known germline single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
that fell in that segment (that necessarily occurred before the WGD) and the VAF 
of somatic mutations assigned to branches further down the tree (that necessarily 
occurred after the WGD) was examined. If, in a given sample, a mutation had a 
VAF greater than 90% of the VAFs of the mutations that were known to occur 
further down tree it was considered to have occurred before the WGD, whereas 
if it had a VAF less than 90% of the VAFs of the SNPs it was considered to have 
occurred after the WGD. If there was any overlap between the 90th percentiles of 
the SNPs and the later mutations, or if the mutation fitted neither of these criteria, 
it was considered uninformative and was not used in the signature analysis. This 
accounted for 9,094 mutations (out of a total of 12,623 assigned to the trunk) that 
were not used in signature analysis. There is no reason to believe that mutations 
that were excluded for these reasons should be attributable to different mutational 
signatures than those that could be included, and indeed their trinucleotide muta-
tion contexts are similar (data not shown). For each mutation, then, the number 
of samples in which it had been counted before and after the WGD was tallied. If 
a mutation was called as occurring before the WGD in some samples and after the 
WGD in others, the mutation was designated as conflicting and excluded from 
the analysis. Eighty-two mutations fell into this category, and the remaining 3,447 
could be timed unambiguously relative to the WGD and used in the signature 
analysis. In Fig. 1 we extrapolated the preWGD and postWGD fractions and their 
relative signature components to all mutations identified in the clonal trunk of P2. 
Mutations that were included in the signature analysis, those that were excluded 
as being uninformative, and those that were excluded as being conflicting, are 
reported in Supplementary Datafile S4.
Indels. For indels, we simply aimed to estimate the proportion that occurred before 
and after the WGD, and so for this analysis we restricted ourselves to regions of the 
genome with copy number 2 + 0. An analogous approach to timing substitutions 
was taken, although rather than considering the distribution of germline indels 
and indels further down the tree, a hard VAF cutoff of 0.85 (which separated the 
bimodal distribution of indel VAFs in these loci) was used to define mutations as 
occurring before or after the WGD.
Rearrangements. We timed rearrangements relative to the WGD in patient 2 by 
using the copy number step associated with deletions and tandem duplications 
in the trunk of this tumour, as determined by inspection of the change in read 
counts at breakpoints. The ratio of tandem duplications and deletions that had 
occurred before rather than after the WGD was extrapolated to give a ratio for all 
the rearrangements in the trunk, assuming that the relative proportion of different 
rearrangement classes stayed the same after the WGD.
Driver mutations. Driver mutations in TP53 and APC were timed relative to the 
WGD in patient 2. The TP53 mutation was at VAF 1 in a region that was 2 + 0 in 
all samples, indicating that it occurred before the WGD. There were mutations in 
both alleles (which we will call mutation 1 and mutation 2) of APC. P2.T4.2 and 
P2.T5.1 both had the APC locus called as 2 + 2, and both mutations were at VAF 
0.5. P2.T1.1, P2.T1.3, and P2.T6.2 were 2 + 1 in the APC region. Mutation 1 was 
at VAF 0.67 and mutation 2 at 0.33. In P2.T2.5 the region was also called as 2 + 1, 
but mutation 1 was at VAF 0.33 and mutation 2 at VAF 0.67. This shows biallelic 
inactivation of APC before the WGD.
Assignment of samples to the tree based on targeted sequencing. Samples for which 
both WGS and targeted sequencing were available were used to estimate the sen-
sitivity in the targeted data for finding substitutions that were identified in each 
branch by the WGS data. The targeted capture was designed against 360 cancer 
genes; in addition, all off-target reads that covered substitutions identified by WGS 
were considered. For example, in clone P1.T1.1, a fraction of 0.09 of all substitu-
tions in the ultimate branch P1.T1.1 was found in the targeted data. Samples for 
which only targeted sequencing was available were then assigned to the ultimate 
branch of the tree with which they shared most substitutions. For example, clone 
P1.T1.4 shared a fraction of 0.04 with branch P1.T1.1 and negligible fractions 
with other branches. To estimate the time point at which P1.T1.4 branched off, we 
divided the shared fraction 0.04 in clone P1.T1.4 by the sensitivity in clone P1.T1.1 
0.09. Thus, we estimated that P1.T1.4 shares 0.04/0.09 = 43% of mutations with 
branch P1.T1.1. The proportion of mutations shared with each branch are listed 
in Supplementary Notes section 2.
Driver analysis. To classify driver events in substitutions, indels and rearrange-
ments we used the following criteria: 1) deleterious mutations in genes iden-
tified in CRC by TCGA25; 2) all other known oncogenes carrying a canonical

activating mutation; and 3) tumour suppressor genes with loss of function, and/
or carrying two deleterious mutations. A more inclusive approach for identify-
ing functional mutations is listed in Supplementary Datafile S3 and described in 
the Supplementary Notes.
Mutational signature analysis. Signature extraction based on non-negative matrix 
factorization was performed as previously described32,52. Mutations in trinucleotide 
context were grouped according to branches of the phylogenetic tree or according 
 
to sample. Datasets were combined with data from 560 breast cancer genomes to 
increase performance of the NNMF procedure53.
Expression analysis. Clustering analyses were based on FPKM values calculated 
with the Cufflinks algorithm54. To select informative genes for clustering we applied 
the following filters: FPKM > 1; coefficient of variation across all samples > 0.7 or 
absolute difference > 5. Subsequently, FPKM values were log2 transformed and 
normalized. Normalization across samples was applied by subtracting the median 
expression value from individual expression values. Normalization across genes 
was applied by subtracting the gene’s median expression from individual expression 
values. Normalized values were subjected to principle component analysis (PCA).
For each tumour clone we calculated a set of genes differentially expressed 
compared to all normal clones pooled together. Genes were called as differen-
tially expressed if they had an FDR-corrected P value less than 0.05, resulting 
from a likelihood ratio test using a negative binomial generalized linear model 
fit with the R package ‘edgeR’55. Raw counts were input into the edgeR model, 
along with normalization offsets calculated using the TMM method56. To construct 
the expression-based phylogenetic trees, we calculated Euclidean distances based 
on all genes that were differentially expressed in at least one tumour clone from 
that individual. Trees were inferred by the minimum evolution method, with the 
fast-me.bal function in the R-package ‘ape’57.
Methylation analysis. Methylation arrays were processed using the R package 
minfi58. We excluded three samples that failed standard QC metrics (more than 
1,000 failed probes). We then excluded any probe from the analysis if it contained 
a variant identified in one of the samples, had a detection P value > 1 ×
 10−
10 
in > 10% samples or one sample with P > 0.01, occurred at a location known to 
cross-hybridize with another genomic location, or where there was a known SNP 
at the CpG targeted by the probe. The remaining probes were then normalized 
either using the ‘preprocessRaw’ function when comparing all samples together or 
using the SWAN quantile-normalization method when comparing clones from a 
particular tumour59. The latter method is appropriate when the number of meth-
ylated probes is expected to be roughly constant across all samples, which was 
the case for each tumour. For all comparisons, M values (log2 ratio of methylated 
to unmethylated probes) were calculated from the normalized probe intensities. 
Samples were clustered using PCA. For computational reasons, we used only the 
1,000 most variable probes for PCA.
Probes that were differentially methylated between tumour and normal cells 
were identified using an F-test with variance shrinking and a false discovery rate 
of 0.01 via the ‘dmpFinder’ function comparing each tumour clone to all normal 
derived clones58. To construct the methylation-based phylogenetic trees, we cal-
culated Euclidean distances based on probes that were differentially methylated 
in at least one tumour clone from that individual. For computational reasons, we 
used a q-value cutoff of 1 ×
 10−
8 for selection of informative probes. Trees were 
inferred by the minimum evolution method, with the fast-me.bal function in the 
R-package ‘ape’57.

Life Sciences Reporting Summary
Nature Research wishes to improve the reproducibility of the work that we publish. This form is intended for publication with all accepted life 
science papers and provides structure for consistency and transparency in reporting. Every life science submission will use this form; some list 
items might not apply to an individual manuscript, but all fields must be completed for clarity. 
For further information on the points included in this form, see Reporting Life Sciences Research. For further information on Nature Research 
policies, including our data availability policy, see Authors & Referees and the Editorial Policy Checklist. 
�    Experimental design
1.   Sample size
Describe how sample size was determined.
No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size.
2.   Data exclusions
Describe any data exclusions.
We excluded one normal derived clone from P1 from our analysis. Although all 
characteristics (mutation numbers and signatures) were in the range of the other 
normals, we could not confirm that this clone was an independent sample or a 
subsample from P1.N.2. None of our conclusions would be affected by either 
including or excluding this sample. 
3.   Replication
Describe whether the experimental findings were 
reliably reproduced.
Drug response testing has been replicated and reliably reproduced (extended data 
figure 10)
4.   Randomization
Describe how samples/organisms/participants were 
allocated into experimental groups.
Not relevant to this study; we describe each case on itself and do not make 
assumptions on groups that they represent.
5.   Blinding
Describe whether the investigators were blinded to 
group allocation during data collection and/or analysis.
Investigators were blinded to each cloneID, but not individual's ID during data 
collection and analysis. The reason for this is that samples from the three 
individuals were collected at different timepoints - ie after they underwent surgery.
Note: all studies involving animals and/or human research participants must disclose whether blinding and randomization were used.
6.   Statistical parameters 
For all figures and tables that use statistical methods, confirm that the following items are present in relevant figure legends (or in the 
Methods section if additional space is needed). 
n/a Confirmed
The exact sample size (n) for each experimental group/condition, given as a discrete number and unit of measurement (animals, litters, cultures, etc.)
A description of how samples were collected, noting whether measurements were taken from distinct samples or whether the same 
sample was measured repeatedly
A statement indicating how many times each experiment was replicated
The statistical test(s) used and whether they are one- or two-sided (note: only common tests should be described solely by name; more 
complex techniques should be described in the Methods section)
A description of any assumptions or corrections, such as an adjustment for multiple comparisons
The test results (e.g. P values) given as exact values whenever possible and with confidence intervals noted
A clear description of statistics including central tendency (e.g. median, mean) and variation (e.g. standard deviation, interquartile range)
Clearly defined error bars
