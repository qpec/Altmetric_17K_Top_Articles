Abstract
Background
Increasing evidence shows that health inequalities exist between and within countries, and
emphasis has been placed on strengthening the production and use of the global health
inequalities research, so as to improve capacities to act. Yet, a comprehensive overview of
this evidence base is still needed, to determine what is known about the global and historical
scientific production on health inequalities to date, how is it distributed in terms of country
income groups and world regions, how has it changed over time, and what international col-
laboration dynamics exist.
Methods
A comprehensive bibliometric analysis of the global scientific production on health inequali-
ties, from 1966 to 2015, was conducted using Scopus database. The historical and global
evolution of the study of health inequalities was considered, and through joinpoint regres-
sion analysis and visualisation network maps, the preceding questions were examined.
Findings
159 countries (via authorship affiliation) contributed to this scientific production, three times
as many countries than previously found. Scientific output on health inequalities has expo-
nentially grown over the last five decades, with several marked shift points, and a visible
country-income group affiliation gradient in the initiation and consistent publication fre-
quency. Higher income countries, especially Anglo-Saxon and European countries, dispro-
portionately dominate first and co-authorship, and are at the core of the global collaborative
research networks, with the Global South on the periphery. However, several country anom-
alies exist that suggest that the causes of these research inequalities, and potential underly-
ing dependencies, run deeper than simply differences in country income and language.

 Conclusions
Whilst the global evidence base has expanded, Global North-South research gaps exist,
persist and, in some cases, are widening. Greater understanding of the structural determi-
nants of these research inequalities and national research capacities is needed, to further
strengthen the evidence base, and support the long term agenda for global health equity.
Introduction
Globally, there is ever growing interest in health inequalities, and with this there has been an
increasing volume of research, which identifies that avoidable systematic differences in the
health status of a society exist between and within societies, at all levels (i.e. countries, regions,
neighbourhoods) [1–3]. This research has been produced in the context of different global and
historical trends in the theoretical and methodological approaches used for the aetiology of
health inequalities and their social mechanisms [4,5].
Language and linguistics matters [6], and consequently, the terminology used in this
research field has differed over time, as well as between countries and regions. However, most
terms share a common element of descriptively identifying a systematic difference in health
status between social groups that are unnecessary and avoidable, whilst some go beyond this
by emphasising the unfair and unjust nature of these differences [7–9].
Whilst public health research on this topic can be traced back to 19th century [10,11], global
interest in health inequalities has consistently grown in the last three decades, and particularly
since the establishment of the World Health Organization (WHO)’s Commission on Social
Determinants of Health (CSDH) in 2005. The CSDH started to gather global evidence to
inform effective action and address ’avoidable’ health inequalities [2]. While there was collec-
tive agreement at the time, that the CSDH approach—which focused on the Social Determi-
nants of Health (SDH) perspective [12]—provided a necessary alternative to the biomedical
and individual determinants of health inequalities paradigms, many scholars in the Global
South [13,14] and Global North [9,15,16], have further criticised the conceptual and epistemo-
logical reductionist approach taken by the CSDH, and in the subsequent mainstream health
inequalities literature, that has predominately concentrated on the North’s experience of these
inequalities [10,17,18].
Many social scientists have discussed the historical and persistent undervaluing of scientific
knowledge generated in the Global South, which is thought to include Eurocentric, Anglo-
Saxon and Neo-colonialist tendencies, in the production and evaluation of research, as well as in
authorship [5,6,17,19–22]. Thus, in the case of health inequalities research, if a dominant focus
is on the Global North’s experience and understanding of these inequalities, this may then feed
an assumption that the Global North’s scientific approaches may be methodologically more
developed in their attempts to answer the question of how to achieve population health equity?
[6];[23] and to define and guide global action [22], and indirectly reduce the Global South to a
peripheral player and data-gathering source, rather than an active, research peer [19,20,24,25].
The CSDH 2008 final report ’Closing a gap in a generation' [2] set an aspirational goal of a
narrowing the health gaps that exist at all levels of society, and included three main overarch-
ing recommendations for action; one in particular was focused on the need to understand and
measure the problem and impact of action [2]; [26], based on the dominant assumption that
evidence provides the basis for action [16];[27]. Within this overarching recommendation,
included the need for dedicated efforts to strengthen and share the global evidence base on
health inequalities, expand the scope of public health research, and to develop dedicated

 trained workforce and information systems, as well as to raise public awareness—all to
improve the capacity to act and address health inequalities.
At the same time, in the global health and development agenda over the past three decades,
there has been a strong emphasis on capacity building and strengthening national health
research systems, with a need for more country-specific research, particularly from the Global
South, which has seen a rise in international research partnerships—all to support a more equi-
table, global presence in the production and utilization of research for action [2,28–32].
Research capacity, refers to the potential to effectively use resources in order to produce
research, and the analysis of health research capacity has become a specific object of study in
itself, to determine what kind of capacity exists, where, by whom, and what needs to be
strengthened [30,33–35] and this has begun to be examined for health inequalities research,
specifically [17,36–42].
Scientific output is considered a crude indication of research capacity, as it is a comparable
source that can indicate the amount of research that has been undertaken, where, and by
whom. Bibliometric analysis is a useful quantitative tool that can measure and evaluate trends
of scientific output, and as such is increasingly used to support evidence informed decision-
making processes [43]. Despite its wide application to the health research field, so far this tool
has been limitedly applied to the health inequalities research field [44–46].
Nevertheless, these previous analyses show the current lack of global bibliometric knowl-
edge on health inequalities research, and even suggest that systematic differences (potential
inequalities) exist in the scientific production on health inequalities. For example, Almeida-
Filho et al.[45] found that 75% of the total Latin American and Caribbean (LAC)’s regional sci-
entific production on this topic during 1971 to 2000, was concentrated mainly in four coun-
tries, and considered there to be only three country ’epicenters’ for this type of research in the
region; regional results are discussed collectively in the article, but only a few countries were
discussed in detail, and there has been no updated regional analysis since. In addition, Bou-
chard et al. [46] found 56 countries had contributed to this research field during 1966 to 2014,
10 of which contributed to 94% of this production; however, the results only mention a hand-
ful of the top contributing countries, all of which were examples from the Global North.
As such, these results enabled us to pose some important research questions, such as what is
known about the global and historical scientific production on health inequalities to date? How
is it distributed, in terms of country income groups? What has emerged from different countries
and regions, especially those not previously studied? How has this changed over time? What
type of research networks and dynamics exist within this global scientific output–to establish
which countries are the most influential concerning their contributions to the international
journals in this field? And, do inequalities in fact exist in this research field, globally?
The aim of this study is thus fourfold: i) to analyse the volume of global scientific produc-
tion on health inequalities for over a half of a century (1966–2015); ii) to analyse the distribu-
tion of this scientific production by country income groups and world regions, iii) to analyse
the international collaborations (e.g. co-authorship relations) within this production, and iv)
to establish whether inequalities do exist within global health inequalities research.
Methods
Data source
A bibliometric analysis of scientific publications on health inequalities was conducted over a
50-year period (1966–2015). To accommodate the expected lag in the indexing of publications
into the bibliometric databases, publications from 2016 were not included in the analysis.

 Health inequalities research is known to be transdisciplinary, with health inequalities hav-
ing been analysed from most scientific fields; for this purpose, Scopus database was selected as
the best choice since it allows for bibliometric analysis (similarly to Web of Science, but unlike
PubMed), and it offers more journal coverage than Web of Science [47].
Search strategy
To ensure high sensitivity of the results, our theoretical and methodological approaches consid-
ered the historical and global evolution of what is now identified and understood to be research
on health inequalities [5];[48], and the following comprehensive search strategy was defined to:
[Title, Abstract or Keyword]: (health inequ�) OR (health equal�) OR (health equity) OR
(health disparit�) OR (health/ disparit�) OR (health/ inequ�) OR (disparit�/ health) OR
(ineq�/ health) OR (equit�/ health) OR (equal� /health) OR (inequ�/ mortality") OR (disparit�/
mortality) OR (social /gradient / health) OR (poverty/ health) AND (1 January 1966–31
December 2015) AND Doctype (Article/ Review/ Editorial).
The ’fixed-term’ search terms (health inequ�), (health equity), (health disparit�) and (health /
disparit�) were used to retrieve publications referring to (and including the terms) health (and/
or status) inequalities for example, and that accounted for the different terminology used in
the literature. The semi-free-text search terms (poverty / health) and (social / gradient / health)
were chosen to retrieve historical publications that analyse relationships between poverty and
health outcomes, and those that identify and describe the different gradients in health or health
inequalities according to social (socioeconomic) stratification; followed by (inequ� or disparit�
/ health) to retrieve publications that try to understand the potential causes and/or mecha-
nisms (acting through the multiple axes of social position) that generate health inequalities e.g.
social inequalities of health or disparities in healthcare access [5];[48]. Additionally, the semi-
free-text search terms (inequ� or disparit� / mortality) was chosen to retrieve publications that
examine different eco-social or socio-demographic inequalities in mortality outcomes.
In order to capture both the CSDH and Latin-American perspectives, the terms SDH and
Social Determination of Health [49] were also considered and other related search terms
tested, however through random sampling, we established that the relevant publications could
be captured through the use of the other search terms; therefore, no additional search terms
were included.
The semi-fixed text search term (health variation�) was also considered to potentially
retrieve publications from the United Kingdom (UK) specifically, since under the conservative
governments of Margaret Thatcher and John Mayor in the 1980s and early 1990s, the neutral
expression “health variations” was deliberately promoted in place of “inequalities” in health
[50]. However, after applying this search term and screening all retrieved results from the
entire period, the majority of the publications were found to be false positives (i.e. publications
retrieved through the search, by the search term(s), but that were not actually relevant to the
topic of interest), and the search term was thus excluded from the final search strategy.
Due to the sheer volume of publications retrieved was impractical to hand-search them all,
to validate the approach two authors hand-searched all publications from 1966–1990 as well as
a random sample from 1990–2015, testing individual search terms and combined search
terms, and any uncertainties were discussed between two authors.
Selection criteria
Inclusion criteria were all publications during the period from 1 January 1966 (when the first
bibliometric database was created) to 31 December 2015 (1966–2015); with the search terms
mentioned in the Title, and/or Abstract and/or Keywords; document type was restricted to

 original articles, reviews and editorials; geographical or language restrictions were not applied.
Publications from unrecognized or former countries, or with any incomplete author affiliation
indexed information, were omitted from the distribution related analysis.
Data processing
Data on authors country of affiliation and year of publication was exported from Scopus data-
base (March 2017). As country income group can be an indication of the potential size of its
national budget for research, author’s country of affiliation were classified by income group
(HIC: High income countries, UMIC: Upper middle income countries, LMIC: Lower middle
income countries, LIC: Low income countries) according to World Bank classification [51].
Publications were classified into country income group, according to the affiliation
reported by each author. Multiple affiliations were considered, so publications can be assigned
into more than one income level. For each country income group, analyses were only per-
formed on periods where at least one publication per year was reported.
Furthermore, author’s country of affiliation were also classified by world regions (seven
regions), according to World Bank classification [51]. Data on Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) per capita, 2015 or latest year, (current USD- Dollars, World Bank database updates as
of 1/02/2017), and population size (2015) was obtained from the World Bank as primary
source [51] or the World Fact Book as a second choice [52].
We analysed both the related country income group and geographical distribution of scien-
tific production, which quantifies the volume of scientific production on health inequalities
that each country has contributed to, according to the authors’ country of affiliation at the
time of publication (i.e. country is the unit of analysis).
It should be noted that this does not necessarily represent the original nationality of the
author, however it is the best proxy indication available for country contribution, and if a for-
eign author signs their affiliated to a certain institution in a certain country, then the implied
assumption for the analyses was that they may be considered as a “member” of the scientific
community of that country.
Publications where co–authorship was international, were counted more than once, there-
fore the sum of the number of publications per country (income group and world region) does
not directly correspond to the overall volume of production retrieved, but reflects the partici-
pation and contribution of each country to global health inequalities research.
National scientific production refers to the ability of a country to perform certain research
outputs, which measured alone, may indirectly represent a number of potential factors, such as
level of investment in research, population size or the presence of institutional support. Whereas
national scientific productivity, refers to the ability to achieve research outputs, whilst also consid-
ering the available resources (e.g. research co-authored per human, financial or technical unit), of
lack thereof; thus we also calculated proxies of national scientific productivity by country popula-
tion size and GDP per capita [53]. For example, calculating Brazil’s health inequalities scientific
productivity per GDP per capita = volume of historical health inequalities scientific production
(n = 737)/ Income of country (i.e. 8757.21 USD GDP per capita, 2015) = 0.08 co-authored publi-
cations by GDP per capita. For example, calculating Brazil’s health inequalities scientific produc-
tivity by total population = volume of historical health inequalities scientific production
(n = 737)/ total population (n = 205.96 million) = 3.6 co-authored articles per million population.
Data analysis
Volume of scientific production.
Our study analysed the annual volume of global scientific
production on health inequalities (1966–2015); joinpoint regression analysis was undertaken to

 examine the time trends in health inequalities scientific production over the last half a century, by
country income group.
The number of publications was set as the dependent variable; the year was set as the inde-
pendent variable. Constant variance for error terms was assumed. We considered independent
models with 0 to 3 joinpoints, and used permutation tests to identify the best fitting number of
statistical different periods to describe time trends for each income level group. Additionally,
Average Percent Change and its statistical significance was estimated to summarize and com-
pare the magnitude of intra-period changes by country income groups; a p-value �0.05 was
considered statistically significant. As initiation and consistency in publication frequency dif-
fered by income group, joinpoint analyses were performed starting in the year from which at
least one publication per year was reported. Analysis were performed in JoinPoint Regression
Program [54].
Distribution of scientific production.
We analysed both the income related and geo-
graphical distribution of scientific production, which quantifies the volume of scientific pro-
duction on health inequalities that each country has contributed to.
The percentages of publications that include at least one author from the different country
income groups and each world region were also calculated, to show the publication distribu-
tion between different country income levels and world regions. We presented only the first 20
country contributors per income group.
Additionally, for each of these categories the percentage of publications, with first authors’
country affiliation only to countries within the same income group, and the same world
region, were calculated and compared; this process was independently performed for first
author and for all authors within each publication. All-authors estimates include the first
author. Furthermore, we calculated proxies of national scientific productivity, by country pop-
ulation size and GDP per capita.
International collaborations and co-authors network relations.
Our study analysed the
strength of international collaborations within health inequalities research, through the analy-
sis of co-author networks [55]. We used VosViewer software 1.6.5 [56] to create two types of
bibliometric network visualization maps, which depict the publications co-authored by each
country of affiliation relating to i) the cluster’s link strength network within this global
research activity (Map) and ii) the individual countries link strength network (i.e. inter-coun-
try co-author relation) within these clusters (Map 2).
The cluster’s link strength network map (Map 1), highlights the separation between main
clusters by density measures. In the individual countries link strength network map (Map 2),
location and colour are identical, but proximity must be evaluated by visual inspection. As dis-
tance metric is not intuitive, the inclusion of density measures tries to support this process.
Within both network maps, the different colours represent different clusters memberships
within these two network levels, based on link strength. Centrality in the maps is relevant, as it
represents core countries. Relative proximity is also relevant, for example, the smaller the dis-
tance between the i) clusters or ii) individual countries, the stronger relation.
In addition, for the countries link strength network map (Map 2), each country affiliation is
represented by a circle, the size of a circles indicates the total links (co-author activity) of the
country, and the lines between countries represent bi-national co-authorship links, and the
thickness of the line represent the strength of the co-authorship inter-country relation.
Results
We initially retrieved 33,954 scientific publications on health inequalities (1966–2015), of
these, 4,575 publications were then excluded as co-authors country affiliations were undefined.

 A final total of 29,379 scientific publications were then used in the data analysis, the majority
of which were original articles, followed by reviews, and editorials.
Volume of scientific production
According to our results, the volume of scientific production on health inequalities has expo-
nentially grown over the last five decades (Fig 1).
The first publication dates back to 1966, however it was not until the early 1970’s (1973–
1979) that publications begin to appear annually (e.g. with at least one publication per year
reported), visible by the appearance of the first joinpoint period of analysis, but specifically by
HIC affiliations only. It was not until the early 2000’s, that publications began to appear annu-
ally by LIC affiliations. We found a visible country-income group affiliation gradient in the ini-
tiation and consistent publication frequency on health inequalities.
There are also important similarities in the position of the last two jointpoints (e.g. around
the same years) for all income groups, Between 1997 and 2002, and between 2007 and 2010,
statistical significant changes in time trend were observed for all income groups, with a consis-
tent increase in publication frequency (Fig 1).
For HIC author affiliations specifically for example, consistent co-authorship in health
inequalities research started in 1973, and showed four periods (three joinpoints) with different
time trends: period one (1973–1979) with non-significant average change in co-authored pub-
lications, periods two (1980–1997) and period three (1998–2009) when co-authored publica-
tions annual average growth were 17.8% and 27.2%, and, period four (2010–2015) with non-
significant Average Percent Change.
Distribution of scientific production
We found that 159 countries contributed to the global scientific production on health inequali-
ties during this 50-year period. The top 20 countries that have contributed the most to global

 health inequalities research field were established, as well as each country proportional contri-
bution to the total research output, and scientific productivity, considering both GDP per cap-
ita, and population size. Of these 20 countries, 16 were HIC from North America, Europe and
Central Asia, and East Asia and the Pacific Regions, two UMIC from LAC, Sub-Saharan
Africa, and East Asia and the Pacific Regions, and one LMIC from South Asia. We also estab-
lished the top 20 countries contributors per country income group, as well as their propor-
tional contribution, and scientific productivity by population size and GDP per capita (Tables
1–4).
The top HIC contributor in terms of scientific output was the United States, which alone
contributed to 48.5% of the global scientific production on health inequalities, with at least one
author affiliation in each publication, and the Anglo-Saxon countries, with the United States,
UK, Canada and Australia combined having contributed to ~ 70% of this scientific production,
with at least one author affiliation from these countries (Table 1).
Brazil was the top UMIC contributor, having contributed to 2.2% of the global scientific
production, India was the top LMIC contributor having contributed 1.2%, and Tanzania was
the highest LIC contributor, having contributed 0.2% (Tables 1–4).
With respect to the proportional distribution of authors and first author country of affilia-
tion, the higher the country income group of author’s affiliation, the higher the proportional
distribution of authors (visible by the percentages of publications in the horizontal axis bar)
(Fig 2).
We observe that amongst the publications with co-authors affiliated to HIC and UMIC, the
higher the proportional distribution of first author’s affiliated to that same income group.

 However amongst the publications with LMIC and LIC affiliations, the distribution of first
authors was disproportionally higher for HIC affiliations than from LMIC, and even more so
compared to LIC visible by the bold-line bars.
The proportional distribution of LIC first authorship appears to decrease with increasing
income group of affiliation of co-authors (visible by the blue bars in each income group) (Fig 2).
With regards to proportional distribution by world region, the higher proportional distri-
bution of co-authors region of affiliation, the higher the proportional distribution of first
authors region of affiliation, and world regions which included Anglo-Saxon countries (e.g.
North America, Europe and Central Asia, and East Asia and Pacific regions), had the highest
proportional distribution of both co-authors and first authors’ country of affiliation, compared
to other regions (Fig 3).

 with minor participation in global production in health inequalities research formed mainly
by Middle East and North African Countries (blue) and by Sub-Saharan Africa countries (yel-
low), and two main clusters, one led by UK, the United States, Canada and Australia and
formed mainly by non-European countries (red), and the other one led by Netherlands and
Sweden and formed mainly by European countries (green). The rest of the countries from dif-
ferent world regions (e.g. LAC, South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa), appears to orbit around these
core countries (with different regions) with stronger links with the United States, followed by
the UK, than with Europe and Central Asia (Fig 4A and 4B).
Bi-national links (Fig 4B) show that the UK, at the core of international collaborations,
plays a central role at bridging these two main clusters (red and green); however it is classified
as a member of the red cluster because the UK-United States shows the strongest link (503
points) followed by US and Canada (493 points). UK is also strongly linked to Canada (225
points) and Australia (259 points).
In relation to European countries (green cluster), the UK strongest links were observed
with Netherlands (175 points) and Sweden (148 points). However, their link strength is less
than half of the UK-North America link. Besides the UK related links, strong links were also
observed between United States and Switzerland (141 points), Germany (131 points) and
Netherlands (115 points).
Other relevant non-North America-Europe inter world-region links were identified for
Australia (-United States 223 points, -UK 259 points, -Canada 149 points), Brazil (-United
States 139 points,—UK 67 points), Mexico (-United States 114 points), China (-United States
140 points), India (-United States 99 points, -UK 88 points), and South Africa (-United States
102 points, -UK 91 points).

 Moreover, by cross checking study results (Fig 4B with Tables 1–4), it is potentially possi-
ble to establish whether a country has more domestics vs. international collaborations within
the publications that they have contributed to, relative to other countries.
Discussion
Our study comprehensively analysed the historical and global scientific production on health
inequalities research (1966–2015), and clearly demonstrates the magnitude of asymmetric
trends, inequitable systematic differences, and potential global dependencies that exist and
persist within this research field.
Whilst there has been an exponential increase in health inequalities scientific output glob-
ally during this 50-year period, Global North-South research gaps still exist, and may even be
widening with respect to country income group. HIC disproportionally dominate co-author-
ship and first authorship contributions, with the Global North positioned at the core of the
global collaborative research networks, with the rest of the world (i.e. Global South) on the
periphery of this activity.
Volume of production
Over the past five decades, the volume of health inequalities scientific output has grown expo-
nentially, more so than the average trends in scientific output in general [57], likely linked to
the increased interest and sophistication in the analysis and understanding of health inequali-
ties over time [5];[48], and how they are the social consequence of a hegemonic eco-political
agenda that only benefits narrow class interests [9]. However, within these trends there is a

 visible country income level affiliation gradient with respect to the initiation in the production
of the first publication and in the consistent frequency in production, where authors’ affiliated
to HIC started to publish first (during the 1960s), and more frequently (during the 1970s), as
well as in the designation of first authorship.
We found several notable shift points in the volume of research production, firstly around
the late 1980’s-90s there was a significant, consistent increase in publications for HIC and
UMICs, coinciding with the government interest and awareness of how social conditions and
material deprivation shape health inequities and mortality, firstly in the UK [58–60] the United
States [61,62] and Canada [63], later followed by European counties [64], which most likely
drove further research interest on this topic in these countries and regions. Alongside this, has
been the long research tradition in Social Medicine and Collective Health within Latin Amer-
ica, studying the link between social (and power) inequalities and health, that traditionally has
not been as widely known or acknowledged outside of the region [6], and which appeared to
enter the international scientific literature around this time.
There was a significant, consistent increase in publications for all income groups in the
early 2000s, a likely consequence of the rise in social justice and ’equity in health’ disource in
the 1990s, that acknowledged the need to assess both economic development of countries and
human welfare [65]. This, in combination with the increased sophistication in the analysis of
these issues, created new perspectives on health and well-being, which likely fed into the shifts

 in the global health and development agendas, which we described in the introduction, and
that subsequently led to the establishment of CSDH in the early 2000s.
A few years later, another significant and consistent increase in publications also occurred,
again for all income groups, likely coinciding with CSDH’s final report (2008) and its recom-
mendations that emphasised the need for further global research on this topic, and the addi-
tional importance placed on addressing health inequalites [2]. Since that point, there was
another significant consistent increase in publications, for authors affiliated to UMIC and LIC
income groups specifically.
By 2015, there appeared to be a difference of around 25 years between the volume of
research production by authors affiliated to LIC, compared with when authors affiliated to
HIC reached this same volume of production (i.e. during the 1990s). The visible country
income related gradient and time difference in volume of production, may partly be explained
by the fact that traditionally, there has been a high publishing and subscription costs for inter-
national journals, which may have impeded some lower income countries research publication
process, even despite the later open access movement and reduced costs for lower income
countries [16]; [37], amongst other things.
Another possible explanation, linked to the CSDH 2008 report recommendations, is that in
general lower income countries have more limitations in their national health information and
surveillance systems, which reduces the capacity to collect, monitor and analyse reliable health

 and social-demographic data, and subsequently hinders the capacity to produce research on
the social determinants of health inequalities within a national context.
Distribution of scientific production
We found that 159 countries have contributed to this global scientific production indexed in
Scopus, which equates to 86% of the world. When examining the proportional contributions
of country (corresponding to author affiliations) to the global research base, the following
Anglo-Saxon countries—The United States, UK, Canada and Australia—combined have con-
tributed to around 70% of this scientific production, with at least one author affiliation from
these countries. The European and Central Asian region collectively, has contributed to
approximately 33% of this scientific production.
Bouchard et al. [46], previously found notably more health inequalities publications during
1966–2014 (n = 49,294) than our study, yet only found 56 countries had contributed to the
global scientific production. These important differences are likely due to the differences
between the theoretical and methodological approaches used in our studies. For example, Bou-
chard et al. [46] do not state the theoretical assumptions used to inform their approach,
although, based on the search strategy, they appear to have a slight tendency towards "health
care (e.g. Medicare)" inequalities (p101), which would have likely led to the retrieval of false
positives into the initial search results; whilst healthcare services are linked to health inequali-
ties, the health-care system itself is considered just one of many intermediary determinants
which can be influenced by, and influence the effect of, other determinants of health inequali-
ties [4].
However, our theoretical and methodological approach specifically considered the histori-
cal and global evolution of, what is now identified and understood to be, research on health
inequalities, produced by different countries and over time, to ensure a high specificity in our
retrieve process. This likely explains how, even though we retrieved fewer publications (poten-
tially due to our search strategy document type restrictions), even with the inclusion of one
extra year in our analysis, we retrieved publications from 103 more country affiliations than
Bouchard et al. [46].
Scientific productivity
Distinguishing between the proportional contributions to the global health inequalities
research, by income group and world regions, not only helps to better understand the global
research landscape, but it can potentially allow for fairer country comparisons to be made
amongst countries with similar resources levels and geo-cultural perspectives, and moves one
step closer to a deeper understanding of the potential reasons behind the different national lev-
els of scientific production on this topic. This type of disaggregated information may also be
useful to consider when conceiving future Global South-South and Global North-South
research collaborations and partnerships within this research field.
Furthermore, when national health inequalities research output was adjusted by socio-eco-
nomic and socio-demographic country characteristics (i.e. scientific productivity), we found
several countries actually perform particularly well, despite their limited resources; these
results are similar to what Bahenhorst et al. [66] found for public health research more broadly.
For example, when scientific production on health inequalities was adjusted by country

 income (GDP per capita), Uganda and Malawi perform equally well as the UK, and when
adjusted by population size, Estonia performs better than Germany.
We would have liked to have adjusted national scientific output by the proportion of GDP
expenditure on Research and Development (R&D), however challenges exist regarding gover-
nance and capacity to collect and report this type of data consistently, across years [67], and
for all countries [68]. However, the WHO Global Observatory on Health R&D uses the limited
data available to show general trends, and so we considered these findings with respect to our
study results [69]. These general trends show that, on average, HIC have 3524 health research-
ers full-time-equivalent per million inhabitants compared to UMIC which have 885, LMIC
which have 53, and LIC which have 10 full-time-equivalent per million inhabitants on average
[69].
These trends, as well as our study results, do not of course account for ’brain drain’, the
migration of trained professions, mainly from the Global South to Global North, which trans-
lates into a considerable loss of resources that were invested into the trained professionals by
the home country, that the recipient country then benefits from [70]. Nevertheless, these
results do provide an indication of potential human resource availability within countries; the
presence of a trained national work force can strongly influence national scientific output and
is another important component and/or determinant of national research capacity [33]. These
results may partly explain the income related differences in national research output that we
found.
At regional and country level, there are some interesting cases, specifically from the Global
South, worth highlighting. For example, Brazil was the 5th global contributor of health inequal-
ities research, after the United States, UK, Canada and Australia, and the top LAC regional
contributor, followed by Mexico. Brazil is classified as a UMIC, and is well-known for its long
research tradition in public health and Social Medicine and Collective Health [71], for its
strong political commitment that has contributed to the national mobilization for social and
health equity [45];[72], and for its national repository and observatory of health and its social
determinants [73,74], which contributes to the on-going systematization of evidence and aims
to guide future national research and policy agendas on this topic. All of which, without a
doubt, has fostered the countries strong health inequalities research capacity that can be
observed here.
Almeida-Filho et al. [45] considered there to be three main regional ’epicenters’ for health
inequalities research during 1977 to 2000, based in Brazil, Mexico and Chile, with Argentina’s
and Colombia’s scientific output being more "scattered and unstable". In 2001, Waitzkin et al.
[23] stated that the most favourable institutional conditions for social medicine research in
Latin American at the time, existed in Mexico, Ecuador, Brazil and Cuba, and that in Argen-
tina, Chile and Colombia, as the socio-political conditions remained more adverse, researchers
faced challenges in producing research in this specific field.
Fifteen years on, we could still identify the regional “epicenters” that Almeida-Filho et al.
[45] describe, as well as the strong intra-regional co-author links, potentially due to geographi-
cal and socio-cultural proximity, and linguistic relationships, and the strong national and
regional interest in this research topic. However, Colombia’s volume of health inequalities sci-
entific output increased specifically in the last decade, and by 2015 overtaking that of Chile’s.
Also, interestingly, the LAC region, especially its ’epicenters’, have stronger co-author relations
and links with the United States, followed by the UK, than with Europe, the reasons for which,
may again firstly be due to geographical proximity (to the United States), and or historical and
global geopolitical relationships, which we will elaborate on further in the next section.
Another interesting case is India, positioned as 14th global contributor of health inequali-
ties research, the top LMIC contributor, and the top South Asian regional contributor in this

 research field. A recent systematic review focusing on health inequalities research production
in India over the last 30 years, found that 75% of papers retrieved were led by Indian institu-
tions, and stated that national social and political movements have played an important role in
highlighting inequalities, in addition to social medicine developments in public health educa-
tion, and increased availability in population survey data, which collectively, similarly to the
case of Brazil, have likely assist to built strong national capacity for research on health inequali-
ties [75].
International collaborations and co-author network relations
With respect to the international collaborative research networks, there appears to be a clear
distinction between those countries at the core of the global health inequalities research collab-
orations (e.g. United States and the UK, followed by the other Anglo-Saxon countries, the Nor-
dic and Central-Northern European countries), and those on the periphery of this activity (e.g.
the Global South). Furthermore, the proportional distribution of both co-authors and first
authors’ country of affiliation were higher for authors affiliated to worlds regions that specifi-
cally include Anglo-Saxon countries.
There was also a visible country income affiliation gradient with respect to the proportional
distribution of authors and first authors’ country of affiliation, with HIC affiliations dispropor-
tionally dominating co-authorship in general, and first authorship positions specifically, espe-
cially amongst the publications with authors affiliated to lower country income groups.
This underrepresentation of LIC affiliated co-authorship, and first authorship amongst
those papers which do include LIC affiliated co-authors, may partly be a result of, what has
been described as, ’neo-colonial science’ [20]. However, as mentioned previously, if national
research infrastructure and human resources research capacities are limited, then the national
capacity to produce research will in turn be limited.
It is also important to note that our study only focused on co-authors and first authors, we
did not analyse corresponding author affiliation, which provides another indication of
research leadership, although we suspect that similar trends and dynamics are likely to exist
for corresponding authorship affiliation.
These respective asymmetries in the global scientific output and collaborations appear to
mirror the geopolitical hierarchies and the subsequent dependencies and conditionalities that
are known to have been created over time; it is surely no coincidence that the countries known
for being international funding sources and also the countries at the core of these global
research collaborations [76–78] and those known to be more ’dependent’ on external research
funding are on the periphery. In many lower income countries, the majority of research is
externally funded, which may play a role in fostering and influencing the types of domestic vs.
international research collaborations that are built, as well as potentially creating donor-driven
research agendas that may influence policy agendas, and decisions on national research priori-
ties, which may not necessarily correspond to local population needs [29,30,38,79].
Study limitations and other possible explanations
Our study is constrained by a number of limitations; firstly, in terms of the study design, we
only focused on articles, reviews and editorials that have been published in academic journals
indexed in Scopus. Therefore, this study does not presume to fully reflect all of the work pro-
duced on this topic, which may have been published in other forms (e.g. books, reports, and
national journals). Nor do we claim to present exact numbers in terms of country contribu-
tions to the global scientific production, as we have not hand-searched all retrieved

 publications to confirm their relevance, although we suspect that our results reflect the general
trends that exist within the global health inequalities research landscape.
In addition, the primary source of this bibliometric analysis was international academic jour-
nals indexed in Scopus, and international journals are known to contain an English language
bias, which may skew our results in favours of Anglo-Saxon countries and/or countries were the
national research system incentives publishing predominately in these types of journals [36];[45];
some non-Anglo-Saxon countries have national research systems that incentive and prioritise
national publishing of research findings, in the native language and in different forms, to facilitate
national dialogue and local strategic decision-making [17];[72]. This may reduce the interna-
tional visibility of the research, and mask the actual volume of research being conducted in these
countries, regardless of bibliometric databases increasing their breadth of journal coverage.
There has also been some speculation by scholars, as to whether ’editorial racism’ exists in
the evaluation and selection of manuscripts for publications in international journals with
prejudice against authors from the Global South [21], and Harris et al. [80] show (and mea-
sure) the bias by health professionals and researchers, against research produced by LIC in
comparison to HIC. Nevertheless, such peer prejudice could be potentially offset by increased
investment in research in the Global South, that includes an additional emphasis on solid
methodology, research infrastructure, and high quality presentation, in terms of both writing
and (English) language skills [21].
Thus, whilst our results are based only on publications in international academic journals,
these findings are important to consider, given the weight placed in academia on publishing in
international academic journals, and how it is often used to inform decisions regarding inter-
national development, policy and research agendas. Furthermore, our results likely allude to
the global dynamic within this research field itself.
Lastly, quantitative bibliometric results say nothing about the type of health inequalities
research that has been conducted in countries, globally; further research is needed to contex-
tualise our results and provide in-depth insights into the type of theoretical and methodologi-
cal approaches being used and where, and the national research priorities, as well as enrich
current understanding of the historical and structural determinants of theses global biblio-
metric trends and inequitable gaps in health inequalities scientific output, and collaborative
co-author network dynamics.
Conclusions
Bibliometric analysis is an extremely useful tool despite its focus on international peer review
journals, therefore together with our theoretical and methodological approaches taken to iden-
tify relevant global publications, and the data analysis used, we have a strong base on which to
state that our study presents a comprehensive systematisation of global health inequalities
research (1966–2015), as well as the magnitude of the inequitable bibliometric trends and
asymmetries that exist, and persist, in this research field, globally.
Whilst there has been an exponential increase in health inequalities research output during
this 50-year period, and three times as many countries have contributed to this global evidence
base than previously found, Global North-South research gaps still exist, and in some cases are
ever widening. Higher income countries, especially Anglo-Saxon and European countries, dis-
proportionately dominate first and co-authorship, and are at the core of the global collabora-
tive research networks, with the rest of the world (i.e. the Global South) on the periphery of
this activity. However, several interesting country anomalies exist, that suggest that the causes
of these inequalities and potential underlying dependencies within this research field, run
deeper than simply differences in country income and language.

 Greater understanding of the structural determinants of these research inequalities and
national research capacities is needed, so as to strengthen the evidence base on health inequali-
ties, making it more inclusive and globally representative, which can foster more shared learn-
ing, and provide more effective support towards the long term agenda for global health equity.
