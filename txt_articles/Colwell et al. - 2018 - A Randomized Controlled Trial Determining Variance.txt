ABSTRACT 
 
PURPOSE:   
To compare ostomy-related costs and incidence of peristomal skin complications (PSCs) for ceramide-infused 
ostomy skin barriers and control skin barriers. 
 
DESIGN:  
The ADVOCATE trial is a multi-centered randomized controlled trial, and double-blinded international study with an 
adaptive design. 
 
SUBJECTS AND SETTING: 
 
  
 
The sample comprised 153 adults from 25 sites from the United States, Canada, and Europe. 
Participants were seen in hospital and outpatient care settings. 
 
METHODS:  
Data were collected by investigators at each site during face-to-face visits and during telephone check-in calls 
between visits. Cost of care data were collected using a questionnaire developed specifi
 cally for the study. The peristomal skin 
was assessed using the Ostomy Skin Tool. Health-related quality of life was measured using the SF-12v2. Patient-reported 
outcomes were collected using a patient-centered study-specifi
 c questionnaire. Cost of care was analyzed via analysis of 
covariance comparing total cost of care for 12 weeks between the 2 groups. The incidence of PSC was analyzed via Barnard’s 
exact test comparing the incidence of PSCs between the control and treatment groups. Tertiary outcomes were exploratory in 
nature and not statistically powered. 
 
RESULTS:  
Use of the ceramide-infused barrier signifi
 cantly reduced stoma-related cost of care over a 12-week period, resulting 
in a $36.46 decrease in cost (14% relative decrease). The adjusted average costs were $223.73 in the treatment group and 
$260.19 in the control group ( 
P  
= .017). The overall incidence of PSCs in the study was 47.7%; PSC incidence was 40.5% for 
the treatment group versus 55.4% for controls ( 
P  
= .069, 95% confi
 dence interval of the difference:  
− 
1.2 to 30.4). Signifi
 cantly 
more participants using the ceramide-infused skin barrier were “very satisfi
 ed” with barrier performance (75% vs 55%;  
P  
= 
.033), prevention of leakage (63% vs 38%;  
P  
< .01), and prevention of itching (53% vs 31%;  
P  
= .016). General postoperative 
improvement in health-related quality of life was noted in both groups. 
 
CONCLUSIONS: 
 
  
 
The use of a ceramide-infused barrier signifi
 cantly decreased cost and increased satisfaction with patient-
reported outcomes.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Approximately 800,000 people are currently living with an 
ostomy and about 120,000 new ostomies are created annually 
in the United States and Canada. 
1-3 Up to 80% of patients 
experience ostomy complications 
4-8 and these predominantly 
consist of peristomal skin complications (PSCs). Best practice 
in the prevention of PSCs includes preoperative stoma site 
marking, ongoing involvement of a stoma care nurse, and the 
correct use of well-fi
 tting ostomy products. 
9 Despite these best 
practices, PSCs persist, and new strategies to reduce or elimi-
nate their occurrence are needed. 
 
Healthy peristomal skin is intact and free of visible signs 
of infection or other complications. Peristomal skin compli-
cations (PSCs) can be defi
 ned as skin infl
 ammation, inju-
ry, or damage that occurs within the 3 to 4 inches of skin 
surface surrounding an abdominal stoma or skin covered by 
the adhesive portion of the pouching system (barrier and 
tape). PSCs are attributable to a variety of causative factors: 
mechanical, chemical, infectious, and systemic health con-
ditions.

on the interim results, the subsequent (and ultimately final) 
analysis occurred at the completion of 153 subjects.
The analysis included eligible subjects who completed the 
study between March 2015 and January 2017. Twenty-five 
sites participated from the United States (15), Canada (4), 
and Europe (6), conducting study visits in hospital and outpa-
tient settings. Institutional Review Board or Ethics Commit-
tee approval for this study was obtained for each participating 
site, and the study was conducted in accordance with ICH-
GCP
. The study is listed on http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov as 
NCT02401412: A Study Determining Variances in Ostomy 
Skin Conditions and The Economic Impact.
Adults (18 years or older) who were within 12 weeks after 
creation of a colostomy, ileostomy, or urostomy and who had 
normal peristomal skin were deemed eligible to participate. 
To determine eligibility, the peristomal skin was assessed us-
ing the Ostomy Skin Tool24 and healthy skin was defined by 
a discoloration, erosion, and tissue overgrowth (DET) score 
of zero (or a DET score > 0 if due to normal postoperative 
healing and/or scar tissue). Exclusion criteria included peristo-
mal fistulae, wounds (eg, mucocutaneous separation), lesions 
(such as suture granuloma), infection of the peristomal area, 
tape allergy, and individuals who were residing in long-term 
care facilities (due to difficulty in capturing stoma cost data). 
Pregnant or nursing mothers were also excluded.
Trained investigators recruited participants from their clin-
ical practice settings. Study investigators were health care pro-
viders experienced in ostomy care, most of whom were certified 
WOC nurses, enterostomal therapy (ET) nurses, or stoma care 
nurses. Participants were provided with information regarding 
the study, and written informed consent was obtained from all 
participants before data were collected. Participants were in-
formed that they could withdraw from the study at any time.
Participants were randomized to treatment or control skin 
barrier in a 1:1 ratio via a randomized block design stratified 
by study site; randomization was performed using the elec-
tronic data capture system (Figure 1; Medrio, San Francisco, 
California). Before randomization, the investigator indicated 
whether the participant should receive standard-wear barrier 
or extended-wear barrier if randomized to the control arm.
All data were collected by trained investigators during face-
to-face visits (initially and then every 4 weeks for a total of 
 
3 in-person visits unless a PSC occurred) and during telephone 
check-in calls between visits. Investigators entered data into an 
electronic data capture system (Medrio, San Francisco, Cali-
fornia). The nursing assessment consisted of an observation of 
the peristomal skin with the pouching system removed, and 
completion of questionnaires as described later. At any assess-
ment, if a subject sustained a PSC, the investigator scheduled 
2 additional study visits at 2-week intervals during the 4-week 
PSC resolution period. This flow through the study was de-
signed to mirror best practices for the management of patients 
with new stomas, increasing the frequency of visits when man-
agement of complications was required.
Costs of care data were collected at each study visit using 
a questionnaire developed specifically for the study. Ques-
tionnaire items included treatments related to ostomy and/or 
PSCs (topical medications, clinic visits, and selected accesso-
ry use), social impact of ostomy and/or PSCs (missed work/
appointments), ostomy-related hospitalizations, emergency 
department visits, physician/clinic visits, medication use and 
therapies, and product utilization.
moisture-associated damage, often resulting from exposure 
of the skin to stoma effluent.11 Another cause of PSCs is 
mechanical damage consisting of medical adhesive-related 
skin injury associated with removal of pouching systems.12 
Reported prevalence rates of PSC are as high as 70%.8,10-17 
Regardless of the cause, PSCs significantly impact patient’s 
lives and can lead to pain, reduce life satisfaction, and in-
crease health care costs.2,4,6,11,18
The cost of ostomy care has historically been difficult to 
evaluate due to high variability across countries and regions, 
pouch change practices, product costs, and care delivery 
models. It is generally believed that PSCs increase usage of 
pouching supplies, clinic visits, and other services, increas-
ing the cost burden of ostomy-related care across health care 
systems. Peristomal skin complications also affect enjoyment 
of life. In a study of 239 veterans, Coons and colleagues19 
reported that 16% had difficulty paying for ostomy supplies 
and difficulty paying was a significant predictor of overall 
quality of life. Current estimates of usual ostomy supply 
cost in the United States range $100 to $300 per month de-
pending on insurance coverage and usage.20 Peristomal skin 
problems may create difficulty keeping a pouching system 
in place and lead to higher product utilization and cost.18 
Clearly, maintaining peristomal skin integrity has import-
ant implications for the health care economic environment 
and the individual with an ostomy.
A potential method of maintaining peristomal skin integri-
ty is the infusion of specific ingredients into the ostomy skin 
barrier.21 The treatment product in this study is a skin barrier 
 
infused with ceramide. Ceramides are naturally occurring lip-
ids that are essential to the barrier function of the skin and lip-
id bilayer of the stratum corneum.22 They serve an important 
role in the prevention of transepidermal water loss by fusing 
with corneocytes in the stratum corneum to help form a pro-
tective layer. An ostomy skin barrier infused with ceramide 
may assist in protecting peristomal skin health by reducing the 
incidence, severity, and or duration of PSCs, resulting in lower 
cost of care.
The purpose of the ADVOCATE trial was to compare sto-
ma-related costs and incidence of PSCs between 2 types of 
ostomy skin barriers. The primary objective was to compare 
stoma-related costs with use of skin barriers containing cera-
mide (treatment) to skin barriers without ceramide (control). 
The secondary objective was to compare the incidence of PSCs 
for the 2 groups. Additional tertiary measures were also cap-
tured including patient-reported outcomes (eg, itching and 
comfort) and health-related quality of life.
METHODS
The ADVOCATE trial was a multicentered randomized, con-
trolled, and double-blinded international study with an adap-
tive design. The adaptive design is derived from Mehta and 
Pocock23; it is based on conducting one or more preplanned 
interim analyses to assess the initial sample estimate, which is 
adjusted as necessary. Furthermore, the adaptive design allows 
for early study conclusion depending upon the significance 
level of interim findings. Using published cost estimates18 the 
study was powered to detect a 50% difference in PSC-related 
costs between groups (at 80% power and 5% error), resulting 
in a target sample size of 144 subjects. A preplanned interim 
analysis was conducted at the completion of 92 subjects; based

Each in-person clinical evaluation consisted of a visual as-
sessment of the stoma and peristomal skin and photography 
of the peristomal area. The skin assessment portion of the 
validated Ostomy Skin Tool24 was used to describe the 
 
status of the peristomal skin. Investigators assigned a number 
reflecting the presence and extent of any DET at each clini-
cal evaluation, resulting in a score indicating the peristomal 
skin status. The Ostomy Skin Tool demonstrates moderate to 
good internurse assessment agreement (κ = 0.54) and higher 
agreement between experts nurse assessors (κ = 0.70).25 Sub-
jects were deemed to have had a PSC if the DET score was 
above zero due to anything other than normal postoperative 
healing and/or scar tissue, or the DET score increased above 
the normal score obtained at a previous visit. All investigators 
received training on the use of the DET instrument during 
the site initiation visit and as indicated thereafter. Peristomal 
photographs were uploaded to the electronic database and re-
viewed centrally by WOC nurses to monitor congruence with 
assigned DET scores.
Participants completed a quality-of-life questionnaire at 
their first visit and again during their final study visit using 
the SF-12v2 Health Survey (QualityMetrics Incorporated & 
Medical Outcomes Trust, 2002). The reliability and validity 
for the SF-12v2 have been reported for a range of medical con-
ditions.26 Patient-reported outcome measures were collected at 
the final visit using a patient-centered study-specific question-
naire. Items included ease of product application and removal 
and satisfaction with wear time, prevention of leakage, preven-
tion of itching, and overall satisfaction with the skin barrier.
Participants were instructed to change their pouching sys-
tem according to their health care provider’s recommendations. 
Likewise investigators recommended barrier shape, sizing, and 
accessory use at each visit throughout the course of the study. 
Subjects were enrolled into an 8-week observation period com-
prising a nursing assessment every 4 weeks. All participants were 
provided with ostomy care and teaching per the site’s standard of 
care, and participants who were randomized to treatment used 
2-piece pouching systems with ceramide-infused skin barrier 
(CeraPlus skin barrier with Remois Technology, Hollister In-
corporated, Libertyville, Illinois, Remois is a technology of Al-
care Co, Ltd). Participants randomized to control used 2-piece 
pouching systems with a standard-wear or extended-wear skin 
barrier (FlexWear or Flextend, Hollister Incorporated). The in-
vestigators and participants were blinded to the type of assigned 
skin barrier used. Skin barriers were similar in appearance and 
were labeled without brand names. The first barrier was applied 
during the first study visit, and additional product was provided 
to the subject for continued use throughout the study.
Data Analysis
The main outcome (difference between total cost of care be-
tween treatment and control groups) was analyzed via analysis 
of covariance (ANCOVA). To adjust for any impact, the cost 
of care for 12 weeks was adjusted for body mass index, ostomy 
type and duration, presence of hernia, and investigator site. 
Cost data included for analysis of the primary objective were 
barriers, topical steroid, antifungal powder, antibiotic (oral, 
intravenous, or topical), adhesive remover, skin barrier pow-
der, skin films, belts, adhesive spray, and any unplanned/ex-
tra stoma-related health care provider visit. Skin barrier rings, 
paste, and pouches were not included in the analysis of cost 
of care, as their primary function is for product fit. All costs

were calculated in 2015 US dollars, and skin barrier costs were 
standardized to the lowest reimbursed amount to remove any 
artificial or country-specific cost variances between the skin 
barriers. Supply and medication costs were standardized to ge-
neric forms to remove over- or understating costs. Because of 
variable follow-up time among subjects (1-97 days), costs were 
modeled to create a standard period of 12 weeks.
The secondary objective (comparing the incidence [pro-
portions] of PSCs between treatment and control groups) was 
analyzed via Barnard’s exact test. A PSC was deemed to have 
occurred if there was an increase in the DET score from the par-
ticipants’ baseline. Time to event data (eg, time to occurrence 
of PSC and time to resolution of PSC) was analyzed via stan-
dard descriptive measures and the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney 
U test. Health-related quality-of-life data were analyzed via de-
scriptive measures and ANCOVA. Analyses of qualitative and 
quantitative tertiary variables, such as subject satisfaction with 
the barrier, were analyzed via standard descriptive measures, 
2-sample t tests, and Fisher exact tests.
At the interim analysis (92 subjects), differences in pri-
mary and secondary objectives were evaluated and condi-
tional power was calculated to assess the appropriateness of 
the initial sample size estimate. The revised estimated sample 
size was 210 subjects; a second interim analysis was planned 
at 152 subjects. At the next interim analysis (153 subjects), 
the study was stopped after meeting the predetermined sig-
nificance (P ≤ .026) for the primary objective. Thus, this 
analysis was considered the final analysis. A level of P < .05 
was considered significant for variables not included in any 
interim analyses.
RESULTS
Data from 153 eligible subjects (79 treatment and 74 control) 
were included in the final analysis. Table 1 displays baseline 
characteristics of the 153 participants. No statistical differenc-
es were found between control and treatment groups based

on univariate comparison of these demographic and pertinent 
clinical characteristics.
Cost of Care and PSCs
The adjusted average 12-week total ostomy-related cost of care 
in the treatment group was $223.73, and it was $260.19 in the 
control group (Table 2). This difference of $36.46 between the 
2 groups (P = .017; 95% confidence interval, 6.49 to 66.43) 
represents a 14% relative reduction in costs with the treatment 
skin barrier.
Seventy-three study participants developed a PSC; the inci-
dence of PSCs was 40.5% in the treatment group and 55.4% 
in the control group. The difference in PSC incidence of 
14.9% was not statistically significant (P = .069; 95% con-
fidence interval, −1.2 and 30.4) but based on the observed 
difference; there was a 26.9% relative reduction in PSCs with 
use of the treatment skin barrier (Table 2). Significantly more 
PSCs resolved within 4 weeks with the treatment skin barrier 
(treatment 53% vs control 29%; P = .042).
Patient-Reported Outcomes
Significantly more subjects in the treatment group were “very 
satisfied” with overall barrier performance than were partici-
pants in the control (75% vs 55.2%; P = .033). Significant-
ly more subjects in the treatment group reported being “very 
satisfied” with the prevention of leakage (63.3% vs 37.9%; 
 
P < .01) and prevention of itching (53% vs 31%; P = .016). 
Additional findings for satisfaction measures and quali-
ty-of-life measures are shown in Table 3.
DISCUSSION
The ADVOCATE trial is one of the few randomized con-
trolled trials related to ostomy care. It is unique in its pur-
pose—to evaluate the effect of ostomy skin barriers on cost 
and PSCs. Furthermore, the rigorous design included blinding 
of investigators and participants and was statistically powered 
for the primary objective. Tam and colleagues27 conducted a 
meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing in-
terventions for peristomal skin care and found only 6 relevant 
randomized controlled trials. While they found no statistically 
significant benefit of adjunctive intervention therapies in re-
ducing PSCs, they also found that the studies they identified 
were often underpowered. Therefore, the ADVOCATE trial 
provides important new information addressing a knowledge 
gap about the management of peristomal skin and the cost 
advantages of these improvements.
We found a statistically significant cost savings, favoring 
the treatment skin barrier. The costs included skin barrier and 
specified accessory utilization, medications, ostomy-related 
clinic and emergency department visits, hospitalization and 
social impact of ostomy, and/or PSCs (missed work/appoint-
ments). As such, the prospective collection of ostomy costs was 
highly relevant and provides a level of detail about resource 
utilization that has not been previously reported.
Peristomal skin complication incidence in this study sample 
was 47.7% (n = 73), and the incidence of PSCs was obser-
vationally lower in the treatment group than in the control. 
Other investigators have reported PSC incidence rates con-
sistent with the current analysis; they ranged from 29% to 
63%.11,12,14-17 The wide range of reported PSC incidence may 
be partially due to a lack of consistency in the operational defi-
nitions used between investigators and differences in duration

of subject follow-up. Even during the ADVOCATE trial, an 
amendment was made relevant to the use of the DET score to 
respond to investigator concerns that postoperative skin can be 
clinically normal in the presence of skin discoloration.
Patient satisfaction was generally positive for subjects in 
both groups. Findings of greater satisfaction with barrier over-
all performance, prevention of itching, and prevention of leak-
age are interesting and bear further investigation. Prevention 
of leakage is an important concern that can impact sleep, social 
interactions, and product usage.28,29 Our findings related to 
health-related quality of life are consistent with other authors, 
who indicated it is negatively affected by time since surgery 
and PSC occurrences.30,31
STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS
A major strength of the ADVOCATE study is its design, 
which incorporated randomization and double blinding to 
the prospective comparison of one skin barrier to another. 
This design adds to the rigor of the study and strengthens the 
findings, controlling for clinician bias and subject prognostic 
differences. From a practical perspective, the study design in-
corporated regular assessment and intervention by an ostomy 
nurse specialist who made adjustments in product fit as appro-
priate, in congruence with best practices. In addition, a stan-
dard, validated tool was used for skin assessment to enhance 
the likelihood of reliable measurements across sites. Random 
allocation and allocation concealment helped reduce the risk 
of bias, strengthening the internal validity of the study. Incor-
poration of multiple sites from varied locations and countries 
strengthens the generalizability of the study findings overall.

An ongoing difficulty affecting study enrollment was the 
early and high incidence of PSCs in potential study candidates 
at many study sites, which limited the speed of recruitment. 
Similarly, other investigators have reported up to 80% of clinic 
patients32 and 73% of survey respondents managed their own 
PSCs without seeking care from a health care professional.33 
A possible limitation was the use of only one manufacturer’s 
skin barriers. The choice to use only one brand was made to 
enable blinding and remove brand bias. However, as controls, 
researchers had access to standard-wear and extended-wear bar-
riers in flat and convex, presized and cut-to-fit options, along 
with accessories from any manufacturer. Thus, investigators 
had access to a wide variety of usual options for both control 
and treatment groups. Limitations may also include unknown 
differences in baseline characteristics between the 2 groups that 
contributed to the results we found. Lastly, given that costs were 
modeled to create a standard period of 12 weeks, limitations 
inherent to the modeling of cost data may apply.
CONCLUSIONS
The ADVOCATE study is the first randomized controlled tri-
al with blinding and an adaptive design to compare the effect 
of ostomy skin barriers on cost of stoma care and PSCs. The 
ceramide-infused ostomy skin barrier was shown to lower costs 
and help to reduce PSCs. Peristomal skin health is key to re-
duction of complications and ultimately to the ostomy-related 
cost of care. These findings provide important information 
for clinicians caring for individuals with an ostomy regard-
ing new solutions to clinical challenges of maintaining intact 
peristomal skin while managing costs.
