BACKGROUND: Despite preventive health benefits of the human papillomavirus (HPV) 
vaccination, uptake in the United States remains low. Twenty-four states have enacted 
legislation regarding HPV vaccination and education. One reason these policies have been 
controversial is because of concerns that they encourage risky adolescent sexual behaviors. 
Our aim in this study is to determine if state HPV legislation is associated with changes in 
adolescent sexual behaviors.
METHODS: This is a difference-in-difference study in which we use data on adolescent sexual 
behaviors from the school-based state Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System from 2001 
to 2015. Sexual behaviors included ever having sexual intercourse in the last 3 months 
and condom use during last sexual intercourse. We compared changes in sexual behaviors 
among high school students before and after HPV legislation to changes among high school 
students in states without legislation.
RESULTS: A total of 715 338 participants reported ever having sexual intercourse in the last 3 
months, and 217 077 sexually active participants reported recent condom use. We found no 
substantive or statistically significant associations between HPV legislation and adolescent 
sexual behaviors. Recent sexual intercourse decreased by 0.90 percentage points (P = .21), 
and recent condom use increased by 0.96 percentage points (P = .32) among adolescents in 
states that enacted legislation compared with states that did not. Results were robust to a 
number of sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of HPV legislation was not associated with changes in 
adolescent sexual behaviors in the United States. Concern that legislation will increase risky 
adolescent sexual behaviors should not be used when deciding to pass HPV legislation.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Despite 
preventive health benefits of human papillomavirus 
vaccination, uptake in the United States remains low. 
Twenty-four states have enacted legislation to raise 
vaccine uptake via financial incentives and school-
based education. However, 1 concern is that these 
policies may encourage risky sexual behaviors.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Enacting legislation 
regarding human papillomavirus was not associated 
with changes in recent sexual intercourse or 
condom use during last sexual intercourse in United 
States adolescents.

 Human papillomavirus (HPV) 
is the most common sexually 
transmitted infection in the United 
States.1 Persistent infection with a 
high-risk strain can lead to serious 
health problems including cervical, 
anal, penile, vaginal, vulvar, and 
oropharyngeal cancers as well 
as genital warts in both men and 
women.2 Currently, there are 3 US 
Food and Drug Administration–
approved HPV vaccines, for which 
multiple doses are recommended.3 
–5 
The Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention has recommended 
routine HPV vaccination for girls ages 
11 to 12 since 2006 and for boys ages 
11 to 12 since 2009, with catch-up 
vaccination for older adolescents and 
young adults.6, 
 
7 However, despite the 
availability of the vaccines, uptake 
remains low, with only 49.5% of girls 
and 37.5% of boys having up-to-date 
HPV vaccinations in 2016.8
Many reasons for the low uptake of 
the HPV vaccine have been proposed, 
including high costs and poor access, 
difficulty completing the multidose 
regimen, safety and health concerns, 
and worries that the vaccine will 
promote unsafe sexual activity 
among adolescents.9 
– 
12 Currently, 23 
states and the District of Columbia 
have successfully passed legislation 
regarding HPV to help improve 
HPV vaccination coverage.13 These 
policies vary in terms of leniency  
and include requiring schools to 
provide information about HPV  
vaccination to students, subsidizing 
costs and incentivizing insurers to 
cover the vaccine, and mandating  
vaccination (Supplemental Table 4).13  
Further adoption of these policies 
has been hampered by a number 
of concerns.13, 
 
14 One concern is 
that encouraging adoption of the 
HPV vaccination may encourage 
risky sexual behaviors among 
adolescents, and it may be seen as 
conflicting with abstinence only 
sexual education.14 
– 
17 Consequently, 
many states have had to defer 
vaccination mandates and instead 
pass related legislation focusing on 
HPV education or cost.17, 
 
18 Although 
in recent research no changes in 
sexually transmitted infections 
among privately insured individuals 
receiving the HPV vaccine have 
been found, the broader impacts of 
policies to increase vaccine uptake 
on sexual behaviors in the general 
adolescent population have not 
been examined.19 Rigorous evidence 
in this domain will be critical as 
policymakers continue to grapple 
with strategies to raise vaccination 
rates.
In this study, we examined the 
impact of state-level legislation 
aiming to raise awareness and uptake 
of HPV vaccination on adolescent 
sexual behaviors. We used a quasi-
experimental difference-in-difference 
approach to assess how the policy is 
associated with the number of sexual 
partners and condom use during last 
sexual intercourse.20
METHODS
Data on the outcomes of adolescent 
sexual behaviors were collected 
from the 2001 to 2015 state Youth 
Risk Behavior Surveillance System 
(YRBSS).21 The state YRBSS is a 
large, state-representative, biannual, 
school-based survey of ninth- to 
12th-grade students from the United 
States. Underrepresented minorities 
were purposely oversampled at 
each stage of the 3-stage sampling 
procedure.22 The state YRBSS survey 
collected information from students 
in 25 states without HPV legislation 
and 16 states with HPV legislation 
(Supplemental Table 4). States could 
choose when they wanted to publicly 
report their results, so the coverage 
of states differed each year during 
our study period.
The YRBSS asked students to report 
if they ever had sexual intercourse in 
the last 3 months and if they used a 
condom the last time they had sexual 
intercourse. Ever having sexual 
intercourse during the last 3 months 
was a binary yes or no variable (0 for 
people who never had sex or did not 
have sex in the last 3 months, 1 for 
people who had sex during the last 
3 months). Condom use during last 
sexual intercourse was a binary yes 
or no variable that was conditional 
on ever having had sex in the last 3 
months. As a secondary outcome, 
we looked at the number of sexual 
partners during the last 3 months as 
a continuous variable from 0 (people 
who never had sex or did not have 
sex in last 3 months) to 6 (6 or more 
partners in the last 3 months).
The main exposure was whether 
respondents’ state of residence had 
legislation aiming to raise  
HPV vaccination rates in place  
during the year of the interview. 
Information on the type of policy and  
year of passage was obtained from 
the National Conference of State 
Legislatures (Supplemental Table 4).13  
The exposure was then further 
categorized by the type of legislation 
that was passed: vaccination 
mandates, HPV education (in schools, 
for parents, general awareness, 
research funds), and vaccine cost 
and accessibility (cost of vaccine, 
insurance coverage, prescription 
requirements).
We used difference-in-difference 
models to study the association 
of the legislation with adolescent 
sexual behaviors.20 We compared 
changes in sexual behavior for 
adolescents living in states that 
passed HPV legislation before 
and after policy implementation 
against the same changes in states 
that did not pass legislation. In our 
model, we adjusted for respondent 
age, sex, race, and grade. To adjust 
for potential confounders for the 
association between the states 
with legislation and adolescent 
sexual health behaviors, we added 
state-year factors to the model, 
including state-specific linear time 
trends. In our models, we include 
state effects that account for any 
fixed differences between states

Downloaded from 
 (such as political, educational, or 
teen-aged pregnancy differences) 
and also include year effects that 
account for any trends in the risky 
teenager sexual behaviors over time 
that are similar across all states. 
As a secondary analysis, we also 
adjusted for rates of unemployment, 
teen-aged pregnancies, and sexually 
transmitted diseases among 
teenagers ages 15 to 19 as well as the 
Children’s Health Insurance Program 
(CHIP) and the Medicaid program 
of the states, the majority political 
party of the state legislature, and the 
political party of the governor. CHIP 
and Medicaid were included in case 
any changes to health care coverage 
for adolescents or vaccinations 
occurred around the same time that 
legislation was passed and could 
be acting as a confounder for the 
relationship between legislation 
and adolescent sexual behaviors. 
We estimated models, defining the 
exposure as passage of any policy 
as well as passage of specific types 
of legislation, including mandates, 
legislation about vaccine cost 
or access, and legislation about 
education. Because of the small 
number of states with mandates and 
the timing of the mandates, we were 
not able to examine the effect of the 
mandates separately and instead, 
they are only included in the any 
policy analysis.
Although our main outcomes were 
binary variables, we used ordinary 
least squares regression to estimate 
our models. This is because there 
are well-known biases in limited 
dependent variable estimators in 
fixed effect models.23 For all models, 
we corrected SEs for clustering at 
the state level to account for serial 
correlation in the outcome.24 Survey 
weights were used when examining 
the descriptive characteristics of 
states with legislation compared 
with states without legislation. 
Survey weights were not used in 
the difference-in-difference models 
because individual-level error terms 
clustered within a larger group (each 
state) could yield inappropriately 
inflated SEs.25 Additionally, we 
did not a priori expect large 
heterogeneous effects because the 
survey was not sampled by the 
outcome of interest.25 However, we 
still ran the main models using the 
survey weights to compare with our 
main models that did not include 
survey weights.
We estimated several additional 
models. First, we assessed potential 
violations of the parallel trends 
assumption of the difference-in-
difference model.20 Specifically, 
we examined whether trends in 
sexual behavior before policy 
implementation differed in states 
passing policies versus those that 
did not. Second, we estimated our 
main models by subgroups of age, 
sex, grade, and race and/or ethnicity. 
Bonferroni corrections were used to 
account for multiple testing. With 18 
main regressions run for the analysis, 
results were considered statistically 
significant when the P value was <.003.  
Third, because an assumption of 
this model is that the effects are 
immediate, we did a lagged analysis 
to see what happened when we 
looked at the effect of the legislation 
among students years after it was 
passed. The idea of the lag is that 
most HPV vaccination education and 
coverage should be affecting 11- to 
12-year-olds, and our YRBSS data are 
taken from older students (mainly 
15–18-year-olds), so looking at a 
lagged timing of legislation will let 
us see if the effect of the legislation 
was limited to kids who were age 11 
to 12 at the time of the legislation. 
Additionally, in the lagged analysis, 
we also account for the fact that 
implementation of the legislation 
most often happened the year after 
the policy was passed. However, 
because states did not always report 
their data for every survey year, we 
do not have as many states reporting 
their data after 2011, and lagged 
results should be interpreted with 
caution. Fourth, as a prespecified 
falsification test, we also examined 
lead effects because the first HPV 
vaccine was approved in 2006.26 This 
study is exempt from human subjects 
review by the institutional review 
board given the use of publicly 
available, deidentified data.
RESULTS
From 2001 to 2015, 886 981 high 
school students participated in 
the state YRBSS surveys. Of those 
respondents, 224 177 (25.3%) 
reported having sexual intercourse 
in the last 3 months, 491 161 
(55.4%) reported that they did not 
have sexual intercourse in the last 
3 months, and 171 643 (19.4%) did 
not respond to that question. A total 
of 715 338 high school students 
reported the number of sexual 
partners during the last 3 months 
(80.6% of all students participating), 
and 217 077 high school students 
who ever had sexual intercourse in 
the last 3 months reported condom 
use during last sexual intercourse in 
the YRBSS (96.8% of students who 
reported having sexual intercourse 
in the last 3 months). Students in 
states with HPV legislation were 
similar to students in states without 
HPV legislation in terms of sex, 
grade, race, smoking, and alcohol use 
before and after most states passed 
legislation in 2007 (Table 1). The 
average age of students in states 
with legislation was 16.0 years old, 
and the average age of students in 
states without legislation was 16.1 
years old. States with legislation 
and states without legislation had a 
similar percentage of students who 
ever had been taught about AIDS in 
school, with a greater percentage 
being taught about AIDS in school 
before 2007 (91.8%) than after 2007 
(89.2%). The percentage of students 
ever having sexual intercourse in the 
last 3 months and the percentage 
of students reporting condom use 
during last sexual intercourse was

 similar for states with and without 
HPV legislation and decreased 
slightly from before 2007 to after 
2007.
Difference-in-difference models 
revealed no substantive or 
statistically significant changes 
in recent sexual intercourse or 
condom use (Table 2). In Fig 1, we 
plot trends in adolescent sexual 
behaviors from 2001 to 2015,  
in which most legislation was 
enacted in 2007, and it reveals  
no difference in risky sexual 
behaviors in states with legislation 
compared with states without 
legislation. The difference-in-
difference estimates were  
consistent with this. Students  
in states passing HPV legislation 
decreased recent sexual intercourse 
by 0.90 percentage points (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: −2.33 to 
0.52) and increased condom use 
during last sexual encounter  
by 0.96 percentage points (95% 
CI: −0.97 to 2.89) compared 
with students in states without 
legislation. When the results  
were separated by the type of 
legislation, there continued  
to be no significant difference  
in sexual intercourse or condom  
use for states with HPV legislation 
compared with states without  
HPV legislation. For legislation 
regarding education, recent  
sexual intercourse decreased by 
0.73 percentage points (95%  
CI: −2.20 to 0.74), and condom  
use decreased by 0.55 percentage 
points (95% CI: −4.49 to 3.39).  
For legislation regarding  
vaccination cost, recent sexual 
intercourse increased by 0.29 
percentage points (95% CI: −1.96  
to 2.54), and condom use increased 
by .63 percentage points (95%  
CI: −1.23 to 2.48).
In additional analyses, we did not 
find evidence that the parallel 
trends assumption was violated 
(Supplemental Table 5).  
Subgroup analyses revealed 
some difference by age, sex, and 
ethnicity, but no group showed 
statistically significant increases 
in any sexual behaviors after 
the policy. It appeared that girls 
had larger decreases in recent 
sexual intercourse and had larger 
increases in condom use than 
boys. Students under age 17 had 
larger decreases in recent sexual 
intercourse and larger increases in 
condom use than students ages 17 
or 18. There were no differences 
seen by race and/or ethnicity for 
the number of sexual partners. 
White students saw a smaller 
percentage point increase in 
condom use than African American, 
Hispanic, and other race and/or 
ethnicity students. There was no 
difference when CHIP, Medicaid,

 political party, unemployment, 
teen-aged pregnancy rates, and 
sexually transmitted disease 
rates were included in the models 
(Supplemental Table 6). Analyses  
in which we examined lagged 
impacts suggested a substantive, 
but not statistically significant, 
6.1% point decrease (P = .009) 
in recent sexual intercourse and 
a 5.9% point increase (P = .046) 
in condom use (prespecified 
P value threshold of P < .003) 
(Supplemental Table 7). Results 
did not differ for the secondary 
outcome examined of number of 
sexual partners during the last 3 
months. For the secondary outcome 
of number of sexual partners in 
the last 3 months, there was a 
nonsignificant decrease in the 
number of sexual partners by 0.02 
(P = .18) in states that enacted HPV 
legislation compared with states 
that did not enact HPV legislation 
(Table 3). Lastly, as expected, the 
estimates from models in which we 
included the YRBSS sample weights  
were less precisely estimated,  
but the interpretation of the main 
effects was similar (Supplemental 
Table 8).
DISCUSSION
In this national study, we found no 
association between the passage 
of legislation designed to increase 
uptake of the HPV vaccine and sexual 
behaviors among high school–going 
adolescents in the United States. 
This finding was consistent across 
subgroups and robust to different 
specifications and sensitivity tests.
Despite long-standing knowledge of 
the protective benefits of the HPV 
vaccine, vaccination rates in the 
United States remain low.27 Even 
among those receiving the vaccine, 
the timing of HPV vaccination often 
occurs after sexual debut and HPV 
exposure, reducing its potential 
efficacy. A study conducted in the 
NHANES found that 43% of girls with 
at least 1 dose of the HPV vaccine 
had sex before or during the same 
year as their first HPV vaccination.28 
Ensuring that adolescents receive 
the HPV vaccination before their 
first sexual experience is important 
to helping prevent the negative 
health effects of HPV infections. 
Policies to educate adolescents and 
their families about the benefits 
of vaccination and increase access 
will likely be an important part 
of the policy response to improve 
vaccination rates.
Thus far, researchers have found 
minimal, if any, benefits of these 
policies on vaccination rates.29 
– 
32 In 
states that have implemented these 
policies, the ultimate legislation 
passed was often less expansive than 
other debated options. The less-
expansive options passed included 
additions such as opt-out options 
for vaccine mandates that may have 
reduced the number of adolescents 
vaccinated and weakening of the 
policy to just be educational.29 
The weakening of the legislation 
was in part due to concerns about 
behavioral responses to the policy 
in addition to a number of other 
concerns around ethics, health 
benefits, and side effects.14 
– 
16 In 
our study, we show that the policy 
options implemented thus far have 
not raised the risk of risky sexual 
activity. Additionally, adolescents 
appear to be engaged in less sexual 
intercourse over time, even with 
increasing availability of HPV 
vaccination. The percentage of

use during last sexual intercourse 
appeared to decrease slightly from 
2001 to 2015. Our findings and this 
broader context both can be used 
to support calls to adopt stronger 
vaccination education and access 
policies.
This study is subject to a number  
of limitations. First, we considered 
the effects of passage of HPV-
related legislation, which may  
differ from the actual consequences 
of policy implementation. Second, 
similar policies in different states 
may have been implemented 
differently. Data on exact 
implementation were not available, 
and therefore we were not able 
to assess heterogeneity in policy 
effects across states. Third,  
we only examined legislative 
rulings regarding HPV vaccination. 
Many states may be providing  
HPV education and funding  
through state public health 
departments that do not require 
legislation. Nonlegislative HPV 
initiatives were not accounted  
for in our analysis because of  
the difficulty in finding these  
data. Fourth, any unobserved  
or omitted state-year confounders 
that are correlated with both  
the HPV legislation and the 
adolescent sexual behavior 
outcomes could bias our analysis. 
We attempted to adjust for these 
potential confounders in a variety 
of ways and conducted several 
sensitivity checks. However, we 
cannot fully rule out the possibility 
of residual bias.
Fifth, there are missing data  
on the number of sexual partners 
(19.4%) and condom use (3.2%), 
which may create a selection  
bias if students not reporting  
their sexual behaviors did so  
in a way that was also related  
to their state’s HPV legislation 
policy. For example, if students  
with riskier behaviors are less 
likely to report their behaviors  
on the survey, and they are more 
likely to live in states that passed 
HPV legislation, we may be  
worried about selection bias. 
However, it seems that teenagers’ 
reporting of their sexual behaviors 
may not be related to their state’s 
HPV legislation policy, so we are 
not strongly concerned about this 
bias. Sixth, we also do not have 
complete information on all  
states with HPV legislation  
policies in the YRBSS state survey 
sample, so with our results, 
although coming from a wide 
regional distribution in the  
United States, we should take  
into account that results may  
not be generalizable to states  
not included in the analysis.
CONCLUSIONS
HPV legislation does not appear 
to have a detrimental effect on 
adolescent sexual behaviors. 
This study, taken with the other 
studies in which researchers look 
at the impact of HPV vaccines on 
adolescent sexual behavior and the 
low vaccination rates in the United

FIGURE 1
Adolescent sexual behaviors over time in states with HPV legislation and states without HPV legislation. 
A, Sexual intercourse during the last 3 months. B, Condom use during last sexual intercourse. In A, we 
show the percentage of adolescents ever having sexual intercourse over the last 3 months for states 
that passed HPV legislation (solid black line) and states that did not pass HPV legislation (dashed 
black line). In B, we show the percentage of adolescents using condoms the last time they had sexual 
intercourse for states that passed HPV legislation (solid black line) and states that did not pass HPV 
legislation (dashed black line). Most states that passed HPV legislation did so in 2007. The first HPV 
vaccination was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2006.

 States, can be used to provide 
support for the reintroduction 
and strengthening of legislation 
regarding the HPV vaccine. Concern 
that legislation will increase 
risky adolescent sexual behaviors 
should not be used when deciding 
to pass legislation regarding HPV 
vaccination.
