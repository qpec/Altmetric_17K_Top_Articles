Background: There is growing awareness of the detrimental effects of alcohol industry commercial activities, and
concern about possible adverse impacts of its corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, on public health. The
aims of this systematic review were to summarize and examine what is known about CSR initiatives undertaken by
alcohol industry actors in respect of harmful drinking globally. Methods: We searched for peer-reviewed studies
published since 1980 of alcohol industry CSR initiatives in seven electronic databases. The basic search strategy was
organized around the three constructs of ‘alcohol’, ‘industry’ and ‘corporate social responsibility’. We performed
the searches on 21 July 2017. Data from included studies were analyzed inductively, according to the extent to
which they addressed specified research objectives. Results: A total of 21 studies were included. We identified five
types of CSR initiatives relevant to the reduction of harmful drinking: alcohol information and education
provision; drink driving prevention; research involvement; policy involvement and the creation of social aspects
organizations. Individual companies appear to undertake different CSR initiatives than do industry-funded social
aspects organizations. There is no robust evidence that alcohol industry CSR initiatives reduce harmful drinking.
There is good evidence, however, that CSR initiatives are used to influence the framing of the nature of alcohol-
related issues in line with industry interests. Conclusions:This research literature is at an early stage of develop-
ment. Alcohol policy measures to reduce harmful drinking are needed, and the alcohol industry CSR initiatives
studied so far do not contribute to the attainment of this goal.

Introduction
T
oday most large companies in the alcohol industry, like other
corporate sectors, undertake corporate social responsibility
(CSR) initiatives.1 Social responsibility in businesses is informed
by a range of principles, including those that arise from outside
the corporate sphere, such as the United Nations (UN) Global
Compact,2 or the International Organization for Standardization
(ISO).3 The latter details in ISO 26 0003,4 that ‘business and organ-
izations do not operate in a vacuum. Their relationship to the
society and environment in which they operate is a critical factor
in their ability to continue to operate effectively’ and defines a ‘CSR
initiative’ as ‘programme or activity expressly devoted to meeting a
particular aim related to social responsibility’.3,4
Within the alcohol industry, CSR initiatives are usually directed at
limiting the damage caused by alcohol1,5 and appear to give
prominence to responsible drinking, voluntary regulation and phil-
anthropy.5 In 2012, 12 global alcohol producer organizations
announced their ‘wish to demonstrate their support of international
efforts to improve health and social outcomes for individuals,
families and communities’,6 through a series of commitments:
reducing
under-age
drinking;
strengthening
and
expanding
marketing codes of practice; providing consumer information and
responsible product innovation; reducing drinking and driving and
enlisting the support of retailers to reduce harmful drinking.7
Alcohol
industry-funded
‘social
aspects’
organizations
were
created by companies in collaboration with each other as vehicles
for CSR.1,8,9 Stichting Verantwoorde Alcoholconsumptie emerged in
1984 in the Netherlands,9 and the number of social aspects
organizations has grown rapidly in recent years, with more than
40 organizations in existence globally in 2013.1 Research funding
organizations, a more specific form of social aspects organization,
have a somewhat older history, having been in existence for almost
50 years.1 Today, the major global alcohol producer companies are
members of the International Alliance for Responsible Drinking
(IARD), one such organization that presents itself as being ‘part of
the solution envisaged by the world’s governments when they agreed
to the global target of a 10% reduction in the harmful use of alcohol
by 2025’.10
There is growing concern in the public health community about
CSR in the alcohol industry,1,5,8 as well as in other industries.11,12 It
has been suggested that CSR initiatives may be designed to serve
public relations goals and the broader political and economic
interests of alcohol industry actors.1,5,13 Critics of alcohol industry
CSR point towards an inherent conflict of interest that exists
between the economic objectives of the industry, which are
concerned with maximizing profits, most of which are generated
from harmful drinking, and public health objectives to reduce the
harms caused by alcohol, which generally require reductions in
alcohol consumption.1,5,8,14
Garriga and Mele15 identify four types of CSR theory as follows:
(i)
instrumental
(CSR
used
to
advance
primarily
economic
objectives); (ii) political (CSR used to influence policy and extend
power within society); (iii) integrative (where social objectives are
combined
with
economic
ones)
and
(iv)
ethical
(where
responsibilities to society are met). The public health community
largely regards alcohol industry CSR as instrumental and/or
political.
To our knowledge, there is no systematic review of existing studies
of alcohol industry CSR initiatives. Two related reviews investigated
UK community-level partnership interventions,16 and industry self-
regulation of alcohol marketing,17 respectively.

 The aims of this systematic review were to summarize and
examine what is known about CSR initiatives undertaken by
alcohol industry actors globally with respect to the reduction of
harmful drinking. This study had the following objectives:
(i)
To develop a typology of alcohol industry CSR initiatives;
(ii)
To examine studied CSR initiatives in relation to: individual
alcohol industry actors; types of initiative; geographical
coverage; targeted populations and partners;
(iii)
To identify the evidence available on the effects of alcohol
industry CSR initiatives on harmful drinking, including
evaluation studies of the extent to which they fulfil their
stated aims;
(iv)
To identify evidence of the political uses of CSR by alcohol
industry actors (i.e. in influencing alcohol policies to reduce
harmful drinking);
(v)
To identify gaps in current evidence on CSR initiatives in the
alcohol industry.
Methods
This systematic review is reported according to the Preferred
Reporting
Items
for
Systematic
Reviews
and
Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA) guidance. For the purposes of this study, we excluded
studies of:
(i)
investment of an organization in CSR,18 as such studies are
not designed to be informative about particular CSR initia-
tives, our object of study;
(ii)
any CSR component that is a part of a product promotion/
advertizement
or
other
forms
of
marketing
(e.g.19,20),
including, public relations campaigns and event sponsorships
associated with particular brands. The focus of this study is
initiatives which are exclusively CSR interventions, due to
prior studies of CSR in marketing;
(iii)
self-regulation of marketing and/or advertizement (e.g.17,21),
as this has been previously studied;
(iv)
other CSR initiatives similarly closely connected to the core
economic operations of companies (serving alcohol, product
and supply chain activities, employee welfare, environmental
sustainability—e.g.: initiatives which focus on waste, use of
water or energy efficiency). Such initiatives may be designed
to reduce costs as well as address societal, environmental or
political objectives.22,23
These decisions permitted a study focus on CSR initiatives that have
no other explicit business aims and thus solely can address the
reduction of harmful drinking. We developed literature search
strategies using both Medical Subjects Headings terms and key
words in seven databases:
(i)
Web of Science Core Collection (Web of Science interface);
(ii)
CINAHL Plus (EBSCOhost interface);
(iii)
Business Source Premier (EBSCOhost interface);
(iv)
Embase (Ovid interface);
(v)
MEDLINE (Ovid interface);
(vi)
PsycINFO (Ovid interface);
(vii) Scopus (Scopus interface).
We performed the searches on 21 July 2017. We organized the basic
search strategy around the three constructs of ‘alcohol’, ‘industry’
and ‘corporate social responsibility’. It was developed with the
support of a specialist librarian. We present the search strategies
in Supplementary material S1.
To be included in this review, studies had to meet the following
inclusion criteria:
(i)
Be published in peer-reviewed journals since 1980;
(ii)
Be published in the English language;
(iii)
Seek to study the CSR initiatives of alcohol industry
organizations;
(iv)
Comprise studies presenting primary or secondary research
data published as full length papers or short reports;
(v)
Studies of CSR initiatives across multiple sectors can be
included if alcohol industry data are presented separately;
(vi)
Be focused on CSR initiatives at the supra-national or national
(rather than local) levels.
We excluded studies included in other systematic reviews in this
series
(of policy involvement
and public
health surveillance
studies) as they do not seek to study CSR. We chose the year 1980
as sufficiently early to capture data on contemporary CSR, predating
the global concentration of alcohol producers since the 1990s and
the emergence of social aspects organizations.9
MM screened titles and abstracts. Both authors assessed full text
papers retrieved for inclusion in this review. We downloaded and
imported the retrieved material, and removed duplicates, using
EndNote.
MM
hand
searched
the
journal
Addiction
and
conducted backwards and forwards citation searches, using the
references cited in included data sources, and Web of Science, re-
spectively. We contacted topic experts to request additional studies
that we may have missed. Both reviewers determined eligibility
separately. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion.
MM extracted data from the publications, using cutting and past
into an Excel document, as well as NVivo.
We structured our approach to data analysis using the research
objectives, following both authors reading of all included papers and
discussing how to proceed. For objectives one and two, MM
extracted and coded data in a first stage, with both authors
refining the coding through discussions in later stages in the
analysis. These findings are largely tabulated. For objectives three
and four, both authors extracted data into NVivo and Word,
which was coded as far as possible inductively within each
research objective. JM examined the methodological characteristics
of the included studies. We provide a narrative synthesis of these
findings, drawing on studies in light of the content of their
findings and the methods used. We did not publish a protocol for
this review.
Results
We provide details of the data collection process in the PRISMA
flowchart in figure 1.
A total of 21 studies met inclusion criteria and were included in this
review.1,5,9,22–39 Table 1 provides a brief overview of study findings
and their methodological characteristics. 15 of the 21 studies included
in the review were published since 2012, with 6 studies published in
addiction journals,9,24,27,32,37,39 8 in more generic health journals1,5,29–
31,33,34,36 and 7 in other journals.22,23,25,26,28,35,38 The reports by Jones
et al.22,23 used identical text in parts, discussed the same themes and
included data on five spirits producers in both reports.
As this review did not select studies for inclusion by methodo-
logical characteristics, there is great heterogeneity among the 21
studies in study design and, consequently, in risks of bias, making
any formal assessment of risk of bias redundant. It will be seen from
table 1 that many existing studies of alcohol industry CSR have
weak study designs and are thus not capable of producing robust
findings. Among the existing studies which are more theoretically
informed and address well-constructed hypotheses, findings are
largely characterized by their authors as being preliminary or ex-
ploratory. The literature as a whole cannot thus be characterized
as
being
well
developed
in
methodological
terms,
carrying
important implications for the interpretation of the study findings
presented here.
Types of alcohol industry CSR initiatives
We identified five main types of CSR initiative undertaken by
alcohol
industry
actors:
alcohol
information
and
education
provision; drink driving prevention; research involvement; policy

 involvement and the creation of social aspects organizations (see
table 2). These categories are not mutually exclusive; drinking
driving prevention, e.g. is largely a sub-category of information
and education, though does also involve other interventions. The
creation of social aspects organizations is also a discrete type of CSR,
rather than being an organizational vehicle for the performance of
other types of initiatives. In addition to CSR initiatives directed at
reducing harmful drinking, several studies discussed philanthropy in
relation to non-alcohol issues such as emergency humanitarian aid,
arts and culture. These initiatives included, e.g. the provision of
drinking water,23 the building of schools22 and support to disaster
relief charities.5
Table 3 presents data on information and education provision
and drink driving prevention, the two types of CSR initiatives
employed by individual alcohol companies that were examined in
the different studies included within this review. There were no
studies of the CSR initiatives of individual companies and their in-
volvement in research or policy making, as these activities appear
largely undertaken by social aspects organizations, trade associations
or third parties.
It appears from table 3 that many CSR initiatives that have been
studied were implemented in low and middle-income countries
(LMICs; as classified by the World Bank).5,22,23,25,30,34,39 Some
CSR initiatives were implemented in the USA23,25,26 and in
Europe.5,33,36 The vast majority of these initiatives targeted young
people
and
their
parents.5,22,23,25,26,30,33,36,39
Among
partners
identified were schools,9 hospitals,9 universities and researchers,1,9,29
international and national drugs and/or addiction agencies,29,34
traffic safety agencies,9 automobile companies,9 public relations
companies,5,36 sport teams or players30,39 and charities.9,34,39
The social aspects organizations identified in included studies are
presented in Supplementary material S2. There was most extensive
study of DrinkWise (Australia). In contrast to CSR initiatives by
individual alcohol companies, social aspects organizations that
have been studied were mostly based and operating in high-
income
countries,
particularly
in
Europe
and
North
America.9,24,27,28,31,32,35,37,38 The International Center for Alcohol
Policies (ICAP) was also involved in research and policy activities
in LMICs.29 CSR initiatives targeted academics and health profes-
sionals,
governments,
with
whom
they
established
partner-
ships,1,29,31,32,38 as well as directly targeting young people and their
parents.9,27,28,35,37,38
Evidence of the effects of CSR initiatives on harmful
drinking
We found little evidence supportive of the possibility that alcohol
industry CSR initiatives may benefit public health.26,27,32–35,39 This
concern was first articulated by Grant more than 30 years ago,24 and
according to Babor and Robaina;1
‘the global initiatives promoted by the alcohol industry are over-
whelmingly derived from approaches of unknown or minimal effect-
iveness or approaches shown to be ineffective through systematic
scientific research. Moreover, the industry initiatives only rarely
include practices that the WHO [World Health Organization] and
the public health community consider to have good evidence of

Overview of study and its findings
Methodological characteristics
Grant M24
1984
This is a survey of the contents and audiences of educational
initiatives sponsored by trade associations prior to the
emergence of separate social aspects organizations. Most ini-
tiatives targeted young people and focused on moderation.
The author underlined the lack of independent evaluation
studies of these initiatives, and suggested possibilities for col-
laboration between the industry and the public health
community. (The author became the founding President of
ICAP in 1995.)
Of 50 trade associations contacted in 21 countries, 13
confirmed they had sponsored educational initiatives and
provided some data and 15 others replied to state that they
were not involved in educational initiatives. A narrative
summary of both the 13 and 15 respondents is provided.
The study was framed as a review rather than a survey.
There is no dedicated methods section and limited
adherence to conventions in reporting research studies.
Houghton E9
1998
This is an update of the survey of education conducted by Grant
in 1984 and a comparison of the situation in 1996 by an ICAP
author. It included social aspects organizations as well as trade
associations. Author findings reported that these initiatives
have increased, with some progress on independent evalu-
ations. Drinking driving, youth, moderation and responsibility
remain core contents. The author noted that public–private
interactions increased.
Of 88 trade associations and social aspects organizations
contacted in 33 countries, 32 confirmed they had sponsored
educational initiatives [including 90% (n=unreported) of
social aspects organizations] and provided some data and
27 others replied to state that they were not involved in
educational initiatives. A narrative summary of both the 32
and 27 respondents is provided. There is a dedicated
methods section and a separate discussion section so that
this report more closely resembles a research report than a
discussion paper.

This study focused on CSR and the relations between six large
beer producer companies (three predominantly US-based and
three non-US) and their stakeholders from a business studies
perspective. Seven types of CSR (philanthropic activity, social
reports, business- and social-related community involvement
activities, volunteerism, employer matching programmes and
charitable foundations) directed at stakeholders were
identified. This study described differences among the
companies in the types of CSR programmes and identified sig-
nificant managerial discretion in decision-making about CSR. It
interpreted findings that for all firms much activity is investor
targeted (but not exclusively so).
The study was designed to address theoretically generated
research questions from a business studies perspective.
Multiple data sources were used, with data gathered on
companies over a two-year period in what might be
described as a comparative case study. Similarities and dif-
ferences between companies is the key basis of inference
generation. This was a preliminary study that identifies
many variables potentially relevant to CSR.

This study reported on a study of ‘responsible drinking’
television advertizements from two large US beer companies
shown to teenagers and young adults. Strategically ambiguous
messages designed to engender diverse interpretations
between varied audience segments were identified. The study
concluded that ‘seemingly prohealth messages can serve to
subtly advance both industry sales and public relations
interests’.
This marketing/communications study was undertaken
with a sample size n=326 using basic quantitative data for
measurement purposes. Four pre-specified hypotheses
were tested and support for all four is found. The use of
inferential statistics is limited. Findings of hypothesized
differences in line with predictions among sub-groups,
including by age, suggest that this is a well-developed
study, notwithstanding identified limitations.

This is a study of an alcohol education initiative developed as a
media campaign by an industry actor in Finland. It critiqued the
industry actor’s own evaluation and posited an interpretation
of the self-serving nature of the campaign with public opinion
hardening against alcohol following increases in consumption
and problems following early tax reductions.
This could be interpreted as a form of case study, drawing
on some international comparisons and other literature-
based data, though may be more appropriately viewed as a
commentary piece responding to an important develop-
ment than a research report. There is little dedicated
methodological content other than drawing on data
sources, and little adherence to the format of scientific
reporting otherwise.

2011
This study reported on the communication activities of
DrinkWise. The authors identified that DrinkWise framed
alcohol problems as a cultural issue and focused on under-age
drinking rather than harmful drinking at the population level.
DrinkWise proposes information and education and
emphasizes parental and personal responsibility in ways which
facilitate the commercial objectives of the alcohol industry.
This a media studies case study of Drinkwise which
examined 29 DrinkWise media releases, and matched them
to 55 news articles. Theory-based framing analyses were
undertaken by two coders. Detailed findings on framing
are presented and discussed.

This study sought to document the activities of ICAP. Strategies
identified ‘include producing scholarly publications with
incomplete, distorted views of the science underlying alcohol
policies; pressuring national and international governmental
institutions; and encouraging collaboration of public health
researchers with alcohol industry–funded organizations and
researchers’.
This case study drew upon a large array of ICAP and other
documentary data sources over an extended period of
time to offer a detailed account of the formation and
subsequent development of ICAP, and an analysis of its
apparent function to counter WHO throughout its
history. This is the seminal study of ICAP which has
delivered influential insights on industry political
strategies, and potentially also into CSR more broadly.
There is no dedicated methods section, however, and
the nature of the report precludes direct assessment of
study limitations.

2012
This study examined the ‘responsible drinking’ initiatives of
several alcohol industry actors in Brazil, investigating possible
differences between national and transnational companies.
The initiatives were largely focused on server training, drink
driving and under-age drinking and mostly undertaken by
transnational companies using television for informational
content.
The study involved content analyses of semi-structured
interviews with nine key informants from 5/6 largest
companies and 71 opportunistically gathered company
documents. Detailed analytic procedures are described,
including team involvement in coding data. Triangulation is
discussed. This exploratory study yielded useful data from
both documentary data sources and the interviews, where
direct quotations were used.

This is a study that examined how the CSR activities of the
alcohol industry are relevant to public health research
community and the science/policy interface. Key areas studied
include sponsorship of scientific research, efforts to influence
public perceptions of research, dissemination of scientific in-
formation and related industry-funded policy initiatives. The
authors concluded that the industry intensified its activities in
this area.
This is a narrative review of peer-reviewed data supple-
mented with grey literature data sources and reviews of the
alcohol policy literature. This study provides seminal data
on CSR and science. There is no dedicated methods section,
however, and the nature of the report precludes direct
assessment of study limitations.

This paper provides an exploratory examination of the CSR
reports of the 10 biggest spirits producers. It identified how
corporate actors focus on responsible drinking, and also
addressed other issues such as environmental issues and
impacts within the workplace. Four broad themes are discussed
characterizing the reports as a whole, eschewing any examin-
ation of differences between companies.
This study was conceived within a business studies/
management framework including ideas about the nature
of CSR in that literature. The data sources are identified,
though there is limited information on data collection
timeframes and no content on how data were analyzed,
and thus how the reported themes were developed.

This paper is very similar to the previous one except that it
discussed the CSR of the five largest spirits (as included above)
and five largest beer producers. The same four broad themes
are discussed.
See comments made above.

2013
This study assessed the CSR initiatives of three largest trans-
national alcohol producers, as well as ICAP. The three main
findings were that CSR was used (i) to frame alcohol-related
issues as a matter of personal responsibility and thus shift
attention away from the industry; (ii) to promote voluntary/
self-regulation in order to prevent or delay regulation and (iii)
as an indirect form of marketing.
Detailed information is provided on data collection and
analysis. Data sources included the websites of the organ-
izations, social media platforms, media reports and details
of search methods and outcomes and eligibility criteria are
presented. Total of 281 included documents were coded in
a process involving both authors and thematically analyzed.
Detailed content is reported for each of the main findings.

This is a study of charities funded by UK alcohol industry actors
and of their involvement in alcohol policy making, and thus
potential to be used for political influence. It found that five
charities received funding from the industry and were active in
alcohol policy, two of whom had a distinct position from other
health NGOs during a period of policy controversy.
Detailed information is provided on data collection. Data
sources included the websites of the charities regulators for
England and Scotland organizations and the charities own
websites. Details of search methods and outcomes, and eli-
gibility criteria are presented. Both authors were involved in
the analysis and detailed findings are reported.

This paper treated Drinkaware, a UK social aspects organiza-
tion, as a case study. It examined Drinkaware’s activities in the
context of the literature on other such organizations and
explored concerns about this organization and UK alcohol
policy.
This paper does not have a methods section or present
details of information on data collection and analysis. The
absence of such information precludes direct assessment of
study limitations, e.g. which data sources may have been
missed.

This study examined the evidence base for drink driving initia-
tives sponsored by the alcohol industry. Social aspects organ-
izations and trade associations sponsored more of these
initiatives than any individual company (41% combined). About
<1% of these initiatives were consistent with evidence of ef-
fectiveness in reducing drink driving.
This study used an IARD dataset of global initiatives and
extracted and coded data according to a detailed content
analysis protocol. Two authors were involved in coding
including potential for harm, marketing and policy
influence. Basic quantitative data are provided to enable
comparisons between regions, actors and other variables of
interest, as well as presenting the overall picture and
drawing clear conclusions.

This paper provides a discussion about public–private partner-
ships involving public health and alcohol industry interests and
the ways in which CSR represents a key site of conflict. It used a
specific example a South African initiative sponsored by a
global producer.
This could be interpreted as a form of case study,
presenting contextual data on the UN Sustainable
Development Goals and other material, though may be
more appropriately viewed as a well-considered thinkpiece
on important issues rather than a research report. There is
no dedicated methodological content.
Jones SC, Wyatt A,

2016
This is a study of corporate social marketing in the form of the
promotion of responsible drinking as a means of CSRs. It
identified that such initiatives (i) contain ambiguous messages;
(ii) are not effective in reducing alcohol drinking but could
improve the public perceptions of the industry; (iii) shift
attention away from effective policies to reduce harmful
drinking.
This literature review examined disparate sources on
corporate social marketing and alcohol and presents
coherent arguments in the interpretation of the literature.
There is no dedicated methods section, so the adequacy of
data collection and forms of analysis used are unknown. As
such, this could also be viewed as a discussion paper which
effectively pulls together relevant literatures.

 effectiveness, and few have been evaluated in the low- and middle
income countries where they are now being disseminated’.1
For drink driving prevention specifically, in a major study Esser
et al.33 analyzed 266 CSR activities undertaken by the alcohol
industry. They found that whilst alcohol industry reported an
evaluation of their initiatives in over one-third of cases, only 3%
of these evaluations measured outcomes to establish effectiveness in
reducing drink driving, and none of these were rigorous studies.33
About <1% of studied initiatives were based on any scientific
evidence of effectiveness for reducing drink driving.33 More than
two-thirds of the actions examined in this study were rated as
having potential for harm, 88% potential for marketing and 7%
potential for policy influence.33
Pantani et al.39 reported that the majority of CSR initiatives
undertaken by alcohol industry actors in Latin America and the
Caribbean were likely to promote brands or products. Herrick34
referred
to
mixed
findings
of
an
evaluation
of
a
specific
community based prevention initiative in South Africa, without
presenting the data. McCambridge et al.32 and Jones et al.35
discussed evaluations conducted by industry actors, or by third
parties which had relations with the alcohol industry, and which
involved market research rather than scientific studies of effective-
ness in reducing harmful drinking. The papers by Jones et al.22,23
underline the business interests underpinning CSR activities, rather
than potential societal or public health benefit, as does the study by
Griffin and James.25
Rather than having positive effects in reducing harmful drinking,
a number of studies provide data to suggest that alcohol industry
CSR initiatives may have the opposite effects. Pettigrew et al.37
found; ‘the ‘‘How to Drink Properly’’ advertisement [by Drinkwise
Australia] was liked and appeared to reinforce current drinking
attitudes and behaviours, especially the idea that alcohol consumption
is a natural element of social occasions’ and was ‘supportive of existing
social norms relating to heavy drinking among members of this age
group’. Smith et al.26 similarly found that young people shown ‘re-
sponsible drinking’ messages viewed them as glamorizing alcohol
consumption among young adults, and as being similar to
marketing.
They further demonstrated that the sophisticated
content was designed to segment audiences and engender different
interpretations of the same contents. Pantani et al.39 found that
more than half of the initiatives developed by industry actors
participating in the ‘Producers’ Commitments’ in Latin America
and the Caribbean had marketing potential. Yoon and Lam5
identified that philanthropy yields benefits to corporate donors in
terms of social media and website usage and that ‘brand stretching’
is involved in many activities.
Political uses of CSR by alcohol industry actors
Several studies examined the political uses of CSR, and the extent to
which they furthered the strategic goals of industry actors, with
implications for harmful drinking. Yoon and Lam5 provided a
good illustration of a company’s use of CSR for economic and
political purposes. SABMiller’s sustainable development initiatives
in Africa were explicitly linked by the company to their business
interests as follows; ‘The business objectives for engaging with small-
scale farmers have differed from region to region, ranging from
strengthening
government
relations
to
securing
future
input
supplies’.5,40
Jernigan reported on the extensive efforts made by ICAP to
oppose alcohol policies motivated by public health considerations;29
‘Much of the ICAP’s activities have focused on countering the influence
of the WHO [. . .]. [ICAP] provided model national and global alcohol
policies based on the least effective strategies, and offered technical
assistance in how to adopt and implement these policies [. . .] they

This study analyzed a responsible drinking campaign by Diageo
in Ireland with a view to investigation of framing. It found that
(i) alcohol issues were presented as behavioural rather than
health problems; (ii) there was a focus on public opinion rather
than scientific evidence; (iii) the preferred solutions were in-
formation provision and education.
Documentary analyses of campaign materials used
newspapers, media interviews, websites and social media
data sources. All data were coded inductively by two re-
searchers among the team to produce a thematic analysis.
Detailed presentation of qualitative findings attests to the
rigour of the analytic processes.

This study of a responsible drinking campaign by the Australian
social aspects organization DrinkWise took advantage of
commercial and health communications methods to reverse
engineer the content i.e. identify retrospectively how message
content may have been strategically developed. It found that
heavy drinkers were unable to relate to the heavy drinkers
portrayed in the ads, and, therefore, could not see the need to
modify their own drinking behaviours.
This study used introspection data, a consumer research
technique to gather reflections on open questions
communicated by e-mail from a target population. The
research aims were elaborated within an advertizing effects
conceptual framework which guided coding procedures. A
thematic analysis examined messages processing pathway
and data are presented which extend to perceived behav-
ioural outcomes.

This is a case study of the media content of DrinkWise, the
Australian social aspects organization. Key findings were that
DrinkWise engaged in ‘insulating the alcohol industry against
evidence-based public health harm reduction strategies, by
engaging in agenda building through industry-friendly framing
of the alcohol issue, and dissemination of information subsidies
to elites and policy-makers’.
This study is conceptualized within a media/public relations
and used both a content analysis and rhetorical framing
analysis to examine 40 and 58 media releases respectively.
The former examined the detailed content of the messages
and their target audiences whilst the latter used theoret-
ically based analytic methods to identify definition of the
alcohol problem and possible solutions favoured by
industry actors.

This study examined the marketing potential of alcohol
industry CSR initiatives in Latin America and the Caribbean.
More than half of these initiatives had the potential to
promote a brand or a product, and most were contrary to
recommendations made by the WHO to reduce harmful
drinking.
This study used an IARD dataset of industry initiatives and
extracts, and coded data according to a detailed protocol. A
team of nine expert coders were involved in coding and
inter-rater reliability was examined and reported. Statistical
testing was used to evaluate differences between variables
and selected qualitative data is presented to illustrate the
nature of the potential for marketing.

 excluded or attempted to refute evidence regarding the most effective
strategies to reduce and prevent alcohol-related harm’.29
Jernigan29 gives one example of the success of these efforts: ICAP
claimed that it was able to change the terms ‘alcohol and other
drugs’ used by the US Center for Substance Abuse Prevention,
which, from the alcohol industry’s point of view, ‘incorrectly and
unjustly equates our products with illegal drugs’, and replaced it
with the less problematic expression ‘substance abuse’.29 Jernigan
provides

documentary
evidence
resulting from ownership of a major alcohol producer that ICAP
was established as a form of CSR specifically designed for the
purposes of policy influence.29
Similarly, several studies examine how CSR is used to frame
alcohol
issues
and
to
focus
on
responsible
alcohol
drinking;5,28,32,36,38 ‘shifting the attention from those who manufacture
and promote the products to those who consume them’, as suggested by
Yoon and Lam.5 They also identify how well CSR lends itself to
making arguments in favour of self-regulation. Other authors
noted that the alcohol industry often cited ‘culture’ as a contributor
to alcohol issues, whilst avoiding any discussion on the role that the
industry itself has in shaping that drinking culture.28,36,38 Carah and
Van Horen28 identify how the Australian social aspects organization
Drinkwise worked with journalists and the media to frame alcohol
issues in the ways sought by industry actors, providing source
material in media releases that is converted into news articles.
Framing also has direct political implications, as identified by
Pietracatella and Brady;38 ‘through the PR tools of issue framing and
information subsidies, DrinkWise media relations functions as indirect
lobbying to policy-makers and elites on behalf of alcohol industry
interests’.
In their study of a Diageo information and education campaign,
Petticrew et al.36 identified; ‘indirect lobbying in order to oppose public
health measures by creating front groups, and by forming alliances
with civil society organisations and consumers; the promotion of non-
regulatory initiatives; a focus on individual responsibility, and the
(mis)behaviour of a small minority; the omission of ‘‘health’’ from

et al.32 noted the high profile support Drinkaware has obtained from
successive UK governments and the legitimacy this provides to use
of their materials within the National Health Service. Lyness and
McCambridge31 identified that alcohol industry actors appear to

adopt different positions within policy making to other alcohol
charities.
Discussion
This study describes a literature that is early in its development, and
has been growing rapidly, with three-quarters of included studies
having been published since 2012.1,5,22,23,29–39 Given the clear sig-
nificance to global health of the issues addressed by this literature, it
can be anticipated that it will continue to grow quickly. This is the
first systematic review of alcohol industry CSR. Future studies of
alcohol industry CSR may be informed by the methodological limi-
tations of the existing literature.
This review uses systematic methods for data collection and only
peer-reviewed papers were included here, thus enhancing the
validity of the findings. Review-level limitations are also inherent
in this study design. On the one hand, the exclusion of CSR
content that is explicitly integrated with marketing content, or
which is concerned with core roles as economic operators (such as
server training or reducing the alcohol content of products),
presents a narrow view of CSR. This is especially important in
light of the findings of Pantani et al.39 which emphasize synergies
between marketing and CSR. It is thus likely that CSR studies not
included here because they are concerned with CSR initiatives which
are integrated with marketing content (see e.g.20) will deepen our
understanding of alcohol industry CSR, and particularly its instru-
mental uses. It remains possible that some CSR initiatives which
have not been studied here may contribute towards reductions in
harmful drinking. On the other hand, the exclusion of CSR initia-
tives closely linked to core business practices facilitates interrogation
of the claims made about possible impacts on harmful drinking from
initiatives that are declared to have this aspiration as their sole
purpose.
The inclusion only of studies published in English means that we
may have missed studies published in other languages (though none
were identified in the searches). Nonetheless the absence of formal
risk of bias assessment constitutes a limitation of this review. Other
possible limitations relating to data collection, rather than analysis,
concern the possibility of having missed studies of the CSR activities
of trade associations or small companies, and initiatives at regional
levels in federal political systems. Perhaps the most important
limitation stems from the ‘apples and oranges’ nature of this
review. As the first evidence synthesis in this area, we placed no
restrictions on study characteristics warranting inclusion (other
than presentation of research data in peer-reviewed journals
reports). Approximately half the included studies lack methodo-
logical details that permit any meaningful assessment of risk of
bias, other than to assess their reporting as weak. The study
designs are also highly variable, and largely exploratory in nature,
meaning that caution should be exercised in making inferences
about this research literature as a whole, other than to interpret it
as being early in its development and in some ways more useful for
hypotheses generation rather than for testing.
Consequently, the remainder of this discussion will mirror the
narrative presentation of results, and primarily focus on those
studies without what are regarded as the most important methodo-
logical limitations.5,25,26,28,30,31,33,36,37,39
We now make a number of observations about what can be
inferred as being securely known at this stage in the evolution of
this literature, and what remains to be established in further
research. There is no robust evidence that alcohol industry CSR
initiatives reduces harmful drinking. A brief examination of the
websites (or CSR reports) of major alcohol companies and of
more than 40 social aspects organizations in existence worldwide
will indicate how limited is the coverage of existing studies. It is
judged highly unlikely, however, given the nature of the data
available in existing well-designed studies of the effects of CSR,
that further studies will alter this main finding. The study by Esser
et al. on drink driving33 is particularly strong in this respect. This
study drew on an extensive global database of CSR activities
compiled by the global alcohol producers to demonstrate their con-
tribution to the WHO Global Strategy to Reduce the Harmful Use of
Alcohol.33 This study, appropriately in our view, reaches such a
definitive conclusion on the ineffectiveness of the CSR initiatives
studied, that it seems highly unlikely that further investigations
would alter the main conclusions drawn by reasonable observers.
A number of studies, most notably the study by Pantani et al.39
have identified and assessed potential harms arising from alcohol
industry CSR. Further conceptual and empirical work on direct

 and indirect harms will be useful in exploring how far such potential
is translated into adverse impacts on harmful drinking.
Beyond the direct effects on harmful drinking, the use of CSR in
obtaining access to policy making and/or influencing decision-
making, creates potential for indirect effects on harmful drinking.
There is a strong convergence of evidence from well-designed
studies5,26,28,36–38 on the promotion of responsible drinking. This
attests to the key importance of framing, and indicates that the
framing of alcohol consumption as a matter for individual
decision-making has powerful implications within policy making.
This
framing
lies
in
direct
conflict
with
a
public
health
conceptualization of harmful drinking, and with the scientific
evidence-base on how it may be reduced.
The types of CSR initiatives identified here offer a more specific
typology in relation to harmful drinking than those identified by
Griffin and James.25 The identification of the creation of social
aspects organizations as a form of CSR appears particularly
important in relation to research and policy involvement, where
the actions of individual companies have not yet been studied.
The study by Lyness and McCambridge31 also identifies industry
funding of charities to have implications for safeguarding policy
making from commercial interests. Social aspects organizations, as
with trade associations, appear to represent the interests of the
industry as a whole (or key sections of it), hence their identification
as social aspects and public relations organizations primarily
concerned with managing issues that may arise on behalf of
industry
interests.41
Trade
associations
have
reduced
or
discontinued
their
involvements
in
public
information
and
education, and social aspects organizations now combine this type
of CSR initiative with others such as policy involvement, making
them distinct actors and potentially key organizers of industry wide
CSR. In our review, the only dedicated studies of social aspects
organizations are one study of ICAP,29 one study of Drinkaware32
and four studies of Drinkwise.28,35,37,38
Conclusions
Claims that alcohol industry CSR initiatives reduce harmful drinking
have no foundations in scientific evidence. Preliminary evidence
from an emerging literature in fact suggests two sets of alternative
possibilities are more likely; (i) that alcohol industry CSR initiatives
have no direct impacts on rates of harmful drinking, or that any
impacts are adverse rather than beneficial; and (ii) that industry CSR
initiatives may be used to interfere with the framing of the nature of
alcohol-related issues, and thus the development of evidence-
informed public policies that can reduce harmful drinking. These
conclusions support the further development of political and instru-
mental theories of CSR. Although this research literature is at an
early stage of development, there are clear implications for policy
makers arising from this study; both claims about the putative
benefits of alcohol industry CSR and industry framing of alcohol
issues are problematic and should not be allowed to impede the
development of evidence-informed public policies if harmful
drinking is to be reduced. There are also clear implications for re-
searchers. There is an urgent need to rectify the under-development
of this literature and to develop and apply innovative theories and
robust scientific methods to the study of CSR and related aspects of
alcohol industry practices. Researchers, research funders, policy
makers and other stakeholders should pay careful attention to how
far, and in which ways, CSR forms part of the business and political
strategies of alcohol industry actors, increasing harmful drinking and
blocking the adoption of effective policies.

Key points
� There is no robust evidence that alcohol industry CSR ini-
tiatives reduce harmful drinking.
� Alcohol industry CSR initiatives may be used to interfere
with the framing of the nature of alcohol-related issues.
� This framing lies in direct conflict with a public health con-
ceptualization of harmful drinking, and with the scientific
evidence-base on how it may be reduced.
� The scientific study of alcohol industry CSR is grossly
under-developed and research on this subject can play a
key role in developing more effective alcohol policies.
