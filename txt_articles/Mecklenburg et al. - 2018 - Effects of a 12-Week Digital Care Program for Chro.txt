 CONSORT-EHEALTH (V 1.6.1) -
Submission/Publication Form
The CONSORT-EHEALTH checklist is intended for authors of randomized trials evaluating web-
based and Internet-based applications/interventions, including mobile interventions, electronic 
games (incl multiplayer games), social media, certain telehealth applications, and other interactive 
and/or networked electronic applications. Some of the items (e.g. all subitems under item 5 - 
description of the intervention) may also be applicable for other study designs.
The goal of the CONSORT EHEALTH checklist and guideline is to be  
a) a guide for reporting for authors of RCTs,  
b) to form a basis for appraisal of an ehealth trial (in terms of validity)
CONSORT-EHEALTH items/subitems are MANDATORY reporting items for studies published in the 
Journal of Medical Internet Research and other journals / scienti�c societies endorsing the 
checklist.
Items numbered 1., 2., 3., 4a., 4b etc are original CONSORT or CONSORT-NPT (non-pharmacologic 
treatment) items.  
Items with Roman numerals (i., ii, iii, iv etc.) are CONSORT-EHEALTH extensions/clari�cations.
As the CONSORT-EHEALTH checklist is still considered in a formative stage, we would ask that you 
also RATE ON A SCALE OF 1-5 how important/useful you feel each item is FOR THE PURPOSE OF 
THE CHECKLIST and reporting guideline (optional).
Mandatory reporting items are marked with a red *.  
In the textboxes, either copy & paste the relevant sections from your manuscript into this form - 
please include any quotes from your manuscript in QUOTATION MARKS,  
or answer directly by providing additional information not in the manuscript, or elaborating on why 
the item was not relevant for this study. 
YOUR ANSWERS WILL BE PUBLISHED AS  A SUPPLEMENTARY FILE TO YOUR PUBLICATION IN 
JMIR AND ARE CONSIDERED PART OF YOUR PUBLICATION (IF ACCEPTED).

"Participants in the treatment group were enrolled in the Hinge Health 
DCP for CKP. This is a remotely delivered, home-based 12-week 
intervention that includes sensor-guided exercise therapy, education, 
cognitive behavioral therapy, weight loss, and psychosocial support 
through a personal coach and team-based interactions. The control 
group received three education pieces regarding self-care for chronic 
knee pain. Both groups had access to treatment-as-usual."
 "support through a personal coach and team-based interactions"
1b-iii) Open vs. closed, web-based (self-assessment) vs. face-to-face assessments in the
METHODS section of the ABSTRACT
Mention how participants were recruited (online vs. o�ine), e.g., from an open access website or from a
clinic or a closed online user group (closed usergroup trial), and clarify if this was a purely web-based trial,
or there were face-to-face components (as part of the intervention or for assessment). Clearly say if
outcomes were self-assessed through questionnaires (as common in web-based trials). Note: In traditional
o�ine trials, an open trial (open-label trial) is a type of clinical trial in which both the researchers and
participants know which treatment is being administered. To avoid confusion, use “blinded” or “unblinded”
to indicated the level of blinding instead of “open”, as “open” in web-based trials usually refers to “open
access” (i.e. participants can self-enrol). (Note: Only report in the abstract what the main paper is reporting.

We have previously shown that the Hinge Health 12-week DCP 
improves clinical outcomes of pain, function, and stiffness over a period 
of 6 months after initiation of the program in a single-arm study of 
individuals with CKP [32]. The purpose of this study was to compare the 
short-term effectiveness (12 weeks after initiation) of the Hinge Health 
DCP in improving knee pain and disability to a control group receiving 
treatment as usual and knee care education in subjects with CKP using 
a randomized controlled trial design."

"Only a few studies, however, have examined the use of digital 
technologies for CKP, investigating web-based platforms for physical 
activity/exercise [15,27], pain coping training [28], and more 
comprehensive programs incorporating education and exercise [16,29,30]. 
In particular, there are limited studies using a more rigorous randomized 
controlled design [27,28,30], and the use of digital health in 
musculoskeletal conditions is regarded as early stage [31].  "

the signup period. Batches of selected participants were then 
randomized into treatment and control using a 60:40 treatment:control 
ratio (n=115) or using an 80:20 ratio (n=47). The 80:20 ratio represents 
a deviation from the study protocol due to administrative error, and was 
only used for a restricted time. The effective allocation ratio was 
therefore 62:38 treatment:control. When a batch of applicants was 
randomized, an algorithm shuffled the batch and selected the first 60% 
(or 80%) to enter the treatment, and the remaining 40% (or 20%) to 
enter control."

"The inclusion criteria were: (1) age over 18, (2) knee pain for at least 1 
month in the last 12 months, (3) participating in the collaborating 
employers’ health plans, and (4) provision of informed consent. The 
exclusion criteria were (1) a prior diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, (2) 
surgery on the knee less than 3 months ago, and (3) an injury to the knee 
less than 3 months ago. We did not include knee OA as an inclusion 
criterion, though we did assess the presence of OA through 6 clinical 
criteria [14]."

Current recommendations for management of chronic pain suggest that 
treatments addressing multiple aspects of pain, including physical, 
psychological, and social, are most effective as compared to a single 
therapy [9,10]. Recommended components of effective non-
pharmacological care for chronic musculoskeletal pain include physical 
activity, patient education, weight reduction, and self-management and 
coping strategies [9,11–13]. Thus, an effective treatment algorithm for 
CKP is a comprehensive program consisting of the main components of 
recommended conservative care."
 "Participants were assigned a personal coach that provided support and 
accountability throughout the program, and were placed in a team to 
provide peer support through a discussion feed within the app. 
Participation was completed entirely remotely through the app, at times 
and places chosen by the participant. Reminders were provided by text 
message and email if the participant was not engaging at the 
recommended intensity with the program."

therefore 62:38 treatment:control. When a batch of applicants was 
randomized, an algorithm shuffled the batch and selected the first 60% 
(or 80%) to enter the treatment, and the remaining 40% (or 20%) to 
enter control. After randomization, participants in the treatment group 
received an email inviting them to complete their profile and receive 
their kit to participate in the DCP, whereas those in the control group 
received an email with three education articles to help them care for 
their knee. Due to the nature of the study, neither the study staff nor the

Per-protocol and subgroup analyses are clearly indicated and separated 
from the main intent-to-treat analysis. 
18-i) Subgroup analysis of comparing only users
A subgroup analysis of comparing only users is not uncommon in ehealth trials, but if done, it must be
stressed that this is a self-selected sample and no longer an unbiased sample from a randomized trial (see
16-iii).

specified outcomes. 
DISCUSSION
22) Interpretation consistent with results, balancing
bene�ts and harms, and considering other relevant
evidence
NPT: In addition, take into account the choice of the comparator, lack of or partial blinding, and 
unequal expertise of care providers or centers in each group
22-i) Restate study questions and summarize the answers suggested by the data, starting with
primary outcomes and process outcomes (use)

Not applicable. 
20) Trial limitations, addressing sources of potential bias,
imprecision, and, if relevant, multiplicity of analyses
20-i) Typical limitations in ehealth trials
Typical limitations in ehealth trials: Participants in ehealth trials are rarely blinded. Ehealth trials often look
at a multiplicity of outcomes, increasing risk for a Type I error. Discuss biases due to non-use of the
intervention/usability issues, biases through informed consent procedures, unexpected events.

large improvements in knee pain, physical function, and stiffness in 
individuals with CKP on the Hinge Health DCP that were significantly 
greater than a control group receiving knee care education and 
treatment as usual over a period of 12 weeks after program initiation. 
Participant surgery interest also significantly decreased and 
understanding of their condition increased in the treatment group as 
compared to the control group. The positive results of this study 
demonstrate the potential of the Hinge Health DCP as a treatment for 
the large number of individuals affected by CKP."
(sensor-guided exercise therapy, education, cognitive behavioral 
therapy, weight loss, and psychosocial support) are necessary to attain 
the reported results. Similar to other studies investigating interventions 
for CKP and knee OA, [18,19,23,27,30] due to the nature of this study, 
participants could not be blinded as to the intervention, and thus we 
cannot rule out the possibility of an attention effect. The attrition rate for 
week 12 patient-reported outcomes was in line with other studies for 
CKP [27]. Further, as the rate was similar in both control and treatment it 
is not anticipated to have impacted the findings of the study"
 21) Generalisability (external validity, applicability) of the
trial �ndings
NPT: External validity of the trial �ndings according to the intervention, comparators, patients, and 
care providers or centers involved in the trial
21-i) Generalizability to other populations
Generalizability to other populations: In particular, discuss generalizability to a general Internet population,
outside of a RCT setting, and general patient population, including applicability of the study results for other
organizations

Discuss if there were elements in the RCT that would be different in a routine application setting (e.g.,
prompts/reminders, more human involvement, training sessions or other co-interventions) and what impact
the omission of these elements could have on use, adoption, or outcomes if the intervention is applied
outside of a RCT setting.

Not applicable - the intervention was the standard format.
OTHER INFORMATION
23) Registration number and name of trial registry
diagnosis of knee OA was not required for inclusion in this study. 
Analysis of participant baseline data demonstrated that 74% of 
individuals in the treatment arm and 80% of individuals in the control 
arm had knee OA as defined by clinical diagnosis for knee OA derived 
from the American College of Rheumatology criteria for OA of the knee 
[14]. A sub-group analysis of these participants confirmed the 
successful outcome of the Hinge Health DCP in the primary and 
secondary outcomes over the 12-week period as compared to control, 
demonstrating applicability of the program to highly prevalent knee OA.
