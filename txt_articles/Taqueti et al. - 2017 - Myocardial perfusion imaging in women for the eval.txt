This document from the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology represents an updated con-
sensus statement on the evidence base of stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI),
emphasizing new developments in single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) and positron
emission tomography (PET) in the clinical evaluation of women presenting with symptoms of
stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD). The clinical evaluation of symptomatic women is chal-
lenging due to their varying clinical presentation, clinical risk factor burden, high degree of
comorbidity, and increased risk of major ischemic heart disease events. Evidence is substantial
that both SPECT and PET MPI effectively risk stratify women with SIHD. The addition of
coronary flow reserve (CFR) with PET improves risk detection, including for women with
nonobstructive coronary artery disease and coronary microvascular dysfunction. With the
advent of PET with computed tomography (CT), multiparametric imaging approaches may
enable integration of MPI and CFR with CT visualization of anatomical atherosclerotic plaque
to uniquely identify at-risk women. Radiation dose-reduction strategies, including the use of

 ultra-low-dose protocols involving stress-only imaging, solid-state detector SPECT, and PET,
should be uniformly applied whenever possible to all women undergoing MPI. Appropriate
candidate selection for stress MPI and for post-MPI indications for guideline-directed medical
therapy and/or invasive coronary angiography are discussed in this statement. The critical need
for randomized and comparative trial data in female patients is also emphasized.
Key Words: Stable ischemic heart disease Æ imaging Æ women Æ ASNC consensus statement
INTRODUCTION
The evidence base regarding sex differences in
cardiovascular imaging is substantial with several recent
reviews on the subject.1–6 This consensus statement
from the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology
(ASNC) seeks to provide a comprehensive update to
the evidence regarding the utility of nuclear cardiology
to evaluate women presenting with symptoms consistent
with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD).7 The term
SIHD refers to stable patients with suspected or docu-
mented myocardial ischemia. This may occur in the
presence or absence of obstructive coronary artery
disease (CAD), typically defined as luminal narrowing
of 70% or greater in the epicardial vessels. Ischemic
heart disease events include sudden cardiac death and
acute coronary syndromes, including unstable angina
leading to emergent or urgent coronary revasculariza-
tion. This document supersedes a prior ASNC statement
on the value of stress myocardial perfusion imaging
(MPI) in women8 and aims to represent the use of
imaging within the evaluation for SIHD, including
testing among those with nonobstructive and obstructive
CAD. The current statement highlights the specific
evidence supporting the widespread use of MPI single-
photon emission tomography (SPECT), and the growing
data supporting expanded use of MPI positron emission
tomography (PET) in the evaluation of symptomatic
women for SIHD. Several prior clinical practice guide-
lines and consensus statements have been published on
this topic.5,7
Appropriate delineation and utilization of guideline-
directed care for women with SIHD remain a vital
goal.7,9 In the last three decades, the case fatality rates
for cardiovascular disease (CVD) have been substan-
tially higher for women compared to men.10 Part of the
excess mortality in women has been related to under-
testing and under-treatment of at-risk females.11,12 With
increased awareness and a focus on guideline-directed
strategies for care, there have been recent decreases in
CVD mortality; yet these declines have been far less for
women than men.13 The lack of progress bettering the
lives of at-risk women is disappointing and suggests
opportunities for an enhanced diagnostic strategy of care
that may improve detection and clinical outcomes for
female patients with SIHD. The current document
reviews the latest evidence on the role of nuclear
cardiology techniques in the diagnostic and prognostic
evaluation of women. The following topics are included
for discussion: (a) appropriate use of MPI in women; (b)
MPI with SPECT and PET; (c) MPI as gatekeeper to
quality testing patterns in women, including strategies
for radiation dose reduction; (d) recent randomized trial
evidence of MPI versus other approaches for the
evaluation of suspected SIHD; and (e) future directions
in clinical research for assessing SIHD in women with
and without obstructive CAD.
APPROPRIATE USE OF MPI IN WOMEN
The role of any imaging procedure, in women or
men, is to provide information that refines the clinician’s
decision-making process with the goal of improving
patient symptoms and bettering clinical outcomes. As
such, clinical interpretation of radionuclide MPI studies
relies upon sequential analysis of disease probability,
where the post-test probability is influenced not only by
the sensitivity and specificity of the test, but also by the
pretest probability of disease. In the setting of chest pain
or ischemic equivalent symptoms, the prevalence or

 pretest probability of CAD varies depending on patient
characteristics including not only sex, but also age,
coronary risk factors, and the nature of presenting
symptoms. Patients with low pretest probabilities of
CAD are unlikely to benefit from the addition of stress
imaging for the purposes of CAD diagnosis or risk
stratification,14 regardless of the imaging modality used
(Table 1).9 In patients with a high pretest risk, the
addition of stress imaging may improve cardiovascular
risk assessment and better guide clinical management
including, possibly, coronary revascularization. Thus, an
initial strategy of exercise treadmill testing (ETT)
without imaging is appropriate for low-intermediate
risk women who can exercise and have a normal resting
electrocardiogram (ECG), as supported by randomized
clinical trial evidence15 and recently emphasized in a
consensus statement from the American Heart Associ-
ation (AHA) on the role of noninvasive testing in the
evaluation of women with SIHD (Figure 1).5 Directing
utilization of MPI to those women (and men) generally
meeting appropriate indications for testing, as recently
summarized in the appropriate use criteria (AUC) of the
American College of Cardiology (ACC)9 or in the
Appropriateness Criteria of the American College of
Radiology,16 has the added benefits of reducing: (1)
unnecessary and potentially harmful downstream proce-
dures, (2) radiation exposure, and (3) cost to the
healthcare system; basic tenets of the Institute for
Healthcare Improvement’s Triple Aim.17 Table 1 sum-
marizes the multimodality AUC for the detection and
risk assessment of SIHD in symptomatic patients. A
core component of quality-based imaging, to balance
potential risk with benefit, is the appropriate selection of
patients for MPI. For women where testing is not
supported by AUC or clinical practice guidelines, the
benefit of MPI relative to risk is considered too low, and
either a no testing or an alternative test strategy should
be considered.
SPECT MPI IN WOMEN FOR EVALUATION
OF SIHD
SPECT MPI is a mature technique that is widely
used for the evaluation of suspected or known CAD. In
women, SPECT MPI is highly accurate to diagnose
flow-limiting (i.e., obstructive) CAD and to stratify risk
of IHD events. Advancements in SPECT technology
with high count rate imaging, low radiation doses, and
theoretically, the potential to quantify myocardial blood
flow,18 are likely to further advance the utility of SPECT
MPI in women.
Diagnostic Accuracy of SPECT MPI in
Women
For patients with intermediate pretest SIHD risk,
noninvasive imaging has a well-established role in the
diagnosis of CAD.9 Radionuclide MPI with SPECT using
either exercise or pharmacologic stress testing remains
the most common form of stress imaging in the evaluation
of patients with known or suspected CAD, and represents
a robust approach for diagnosing flow-limiting CAD. A
2012 report from the Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality19 addressed the diagnostic accuracy of noninva-
sive testing techniques as compared with coronary
angiography specifically in symptomatic women with

 suspected SIHD. In a subgroup analysis of 14 studies of
1,000 women with no known CAD, the diagnostic
sensitivity was 81% and specificity was 78% for detecting
obstructive CAD.19 In a subsequent analysis of 30 studies
evaluating women with known or suspected CAD,
SPECT MPI had a sensitivity of 82% and specificity of
81% for detecting obstructive CAD.20
A strength of SPECT is the availability of robust
software programs for the interpretation of MPI. Women
have a smaller heart size compared to men, with
resultant higher image blurring and, potentially, a lower
sensitivity to detect obstructive CAD. Women also have
higher left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF),21 and
may have higher normal limits of transient ischemic
dilation (TID) ratio compared to men.22 As such, sex-
based normal limits should be used for reporting of
LVEF and volumes. Using sex-based normal limits and
software interpretation, diagnostic accuracy for detec-
tion of obstructive CAD was high without significant sex
differences in a multicenter study of SPECT MPI.23
Attenuation
correction
represents
an
important
consideration to improve the specificity and normalcy
rates of SPECT MPI, particularly in women with high
likelihood of attenuation from breast tissue and/or high
body mass indices (BMI). Correction for attenuation can
be achieved through a combination of (1) supine and
prone imaging, (2) supine and upright imaging, or (3)
direct correction using either line sources or computed
tomography (CT). Typically, overall sensitivity does not
increase with attenuation-corrected SPECT MPI.24–28 In
a study of combined supine and prone imaging in
normal, overweight, and obese women, Berman et al.29
showed that specificity and normalcy rates were unaf-
fected
by
BMI,
whereas
sensitivity
declined
in
overweight and obese women compared to normal
weight women. In a subsequent study of 459 women
evaluated with a quantitative method, Slomka et al.30
reported improved specificity and normalcy with no loss
in sensitivity when combined supine and prone imaging
was performed using a standard Anger camera. Ben-

Myocardial perfusion imaging in women
 Haim et al.31 showed that addition of an upright
acquisition to the standard supine acquisition using a
solid-state cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) camera reclas-
sified 69% of equivocal scans in males and 77% of
equivocal scans in females as either normal or abnormal.
Furthermore, the perceived need for rest scanning in
women was reduced by more than 50%. Direct correc-
tion for bodily attenuation is possible using either line
sources or CT. Attenuation correction has been shown to
result in gender-independent distributions of tracer over
the entire myocardium,32 to improve interpretive cer-
tainty, and to reduce the need for rest images when the
stress study is acquired first.33 Collectively, these
techniques have been proven to be of value, and none
require additional dosages of radionuclide. As such, this
consensus statement encourages consideration of one of
these approaches during SPECT MPI, particularly when
imaging is performed in women with large breasts,
breast implants, and/or high BMIs.
In addition, unique sex differences in the develop-
ment of atherosclerosis and obstructive CAD may
underlie some observed differences in test performance
between women and men. There is an increasing
recognition that coronary microvascular dysfunction
(CMD) with or without epicardial CAD is prevalent in
women.34,35 In this setting, SPECT MPI may have lower
apparent specificity for women as compared to men,
especially when obstructive epicardial CAD is used as
the reference standard for diagnostic accuracy of MPI.
Exercise
versus
Pharmacological
Stress
Testing in Women. Exercise stress is preferred over
pharmacological stress for SPECT MPI in women,
except among individuals with left bundle branch block
(LBBB) or ventricular pacing, or in those incapable of
performing adequate exercise, in whom vasodilator
stress is preferred.36 Exercise stress is physiologic and
provides clinical, hemodynamic, and ECG data, which
enable important diagnostic and prognostic information.
However, among women, exercise-induced ST depres-
sion in the absence of CAD has been described in
relation to changes in estrogen levels during the men-
strual cycle37 or from menopausal hormone therapy38
and has been associated with lower diagnostic accuracy
when compared to men.39 In a study of 2,994 asymp-
tomatic
women,
measures
of
reduced
functional
capacity (low exercise capacity, low heart-rate recovery,
and not achieving target heart rate) rather than ischemic
ST depression provided prognostic value.40 As discussed
later, results of the multicenter randomized WOMEN
(What is the Optimal Method of Ischemia Elucidation in
WomeN?) trial indicated no advantage of ETT with MPI
over ETT alone in low-intermediate risk women able to
exercise.15 In contrast, in women with intermediate–
high pretest SIHD risk, the diagnostic accuracy to detect
obstructive CAD is greater for ETT with SPECT MPI
than for ETT alone (MPI, sensitivity 78% [95% CI 72%
to 83%] versus ETT only, sensitivity 61% [95% CI 54%
to 68%]).41 An alternative strategy includes adding
SPECT MPI following an intermediate risk ETT.
Nonetheless, exercise capacity is commonly limited
in women referred for SPECT MPI, who are typically
older and have significant comorbidities. These patients
may need graded exercise stages that increase the
metabolic equivalents of work in a more gradual manner
than in the commonly used Bruce protocol. In women
who are unable to exercise adequately, pharmacological
stress testing provides an alternative to exercise stress
testing. Among men and women with normal adenosine
SPECT MPI, women more frequently manifest ischemic
ECG changes.42 Despite a normal adenosine SPECT
MPI, rates of CAD death and nonfatal myocardial
infarction (MI) were higher in women with ischemic
ECG changes compared to those without ischemic ECG
changes.42,43
It is unlikely that differences in the dosing regimen
of vasodilators significantly impact test sensitivity of
pharmacological stress MPI among female and male
patients. Although adenosine and dipyridamole are
weight-based infusions and, in general, women receive
a smaller absolute dose of adenosine or dipyridamole
compared to men, adenosine44 and dipyridamole45
SPECT are similarly diagnostically accurate in women
and men. In addition, although regadenoson is a
nonweight-based injection of 400 mcg, integrated data
from the two-phase 3 ADenoscan Versus regAdenosoN
Comparative Evaluation for MPI (ADVANCE MPI)
trials, which included 30% women, demonstrated that
regadenoson as compared to adenosine was safe, well-
tolerated, and similarly effective in women as in
men.46
Data support that adjustment for pretest likelihood
of CAD improves the diagnostic accuracy of SPECT
MPI in women, resulting in no significant differences in
women compared to men.47 In a study using vasodilator
stress and technetium-99m (99mTc) MPI, the sensitivity,
specificity, and normalcy rates for detection of obstruc-
tive
CAD
were
high
at
93%,
78%,
and
88%,
respectively; sensitivity and specificity did not vary
significantly by pretest likelihood of CAD. But, as in
men, test sensitivity in women was lower for detection
of significant luminal narrowing in the left circumflex
territory relative to the left anterior descending or right
coronary territories.44 Test performance was high likely
due to better image quality with 99mTc MPI (higher
energy photons and gated imaging) as compared to
thallium (201Tl). The value of 99mTc MPI and gated
SPECT is highlighted by data from another study
1406
Taqueti et al.
Journal of Nuclear Cardiology�
Myocardial perfusion imaging in women
July/August 2017
 wherein the specificity of MPI to exclude obstructive
epicardial CAD improved from 67.2% with 201Tl MPI to
84.4% with 99mTc MPI, and to 92.2% with 99mTc MPI
combined with gated SPECT.48 In high-risk women,
exercise perfusion variables identified high-risk CAD
better than ETT variables alone.49
Other studies have reported sex differences in the
diagnostic accuracy of SPECT MPI, with lower accu-
racy for SPECT MPI in women compared to men.50–52
As already discussed, this lower diagnostic accuracy
among women has been variably attributed to multiple
epidemiological, biological, and imaging factors such as
imaging of women with a low pretest likelihood of
obstructive CAD, reduced exercise capacity and lower
maximal heart rates achieved during exercise (women
referred for testing are generally older than men), higher
prevalence of CMD and single vessel CAD wherein
SPECT MPI is known to have a reduced sensitivity,
smaller cardiac size, and anterior wall attenuation
artifacts from breast tissue.
Risk Stratification of Women with SPECT
MPI
SPECT MPI plays a pivotal role in risk stratification
of women with known or suspected CAD.21,53–56 In a
large meta-analysis, after a mean follow-up of 36
months, the prognostic value of a normal SPECT MPI
among women was excellent with 99% event-free
survival, and similar to that of men.57 A normal SPECT
MPI in the setting of a normal stress ECG portended
excellent survival free of future CAD death or MI.58 In
contrast, the presence of abnormal ST segment changes
with a normal MPI was associated with an elevated risk
of major adverse cardiac events. Abnormal SPECT MPI
provides incremental risk stratification over ETT vari-
ables alone. Hachamovitch et al.53 showed in a study of
4,136 patients (33.7% women) that MPI variables
provided incremental prognostic value over ETT vari-
ables for women and men followed over a mean of
20 ± 5 months. Mild, moderate, or severely abnormal
SPECT
MPI
scans
were
associated
with
graded
increases in adverse CAD events in women. MPI
findings provided better discrimination of risk, identify-
ing higher risk women compared to higher risk men
(area
under
the
receiver
operating
characteristics
curve = 0.84 ± 0.03 versus 0.71 ± 0.03, P \ 0.0005).53
In addition to clinical and perfusion variables, left
ventricular (LV) volumes and LVEF on SPECT MPI
provide incremental prognostic value beyond MPI and
clinical variables in predicting CAD death or MI.21,59 In
a study of 597 women and 824 men, Sharir et al.21
demonstrated that normal limits of LVEF vary by sex
and determine prognosis (Figure 2). In that study,
women with severe ischemia were at very high risk of
CAD death or MI if their LVEF was\
51% (3-year event
rate 39.8% versus 10.8% for EF C51%). Parallel results
were shown in women for LV end systolic volume index
(ESVI) [
27 mL/m2 (3-year event rate 35.1% versus
15.2% for ESV B27 mL/m2). Although both perfusion
and function variables predicted prognosis in women
and men, perfusion variables appeared to add substan-
tially more power than function variables to predict
adverse events in women.21 Finally, other studies have
confirmed the excellent prognostic value of SPECT MPI
in women, including elderly women60 and women of
diverse racial and ethnic subsets.61
A large body of literature supports the excellent
prognostic value of normal stress-only SPECT imaging
when attenuation correction is employed.62,63 In one
pooled analysis (of 22,443 patients, 46.5% with a stress-
only study), a normal stress-only study was associated
with an annual cardiac event rate of 0.7%.58 This risk is
low and comparable to that associated with a normal rest
and stress MPI. The study of Chang et al.62 showed that
a normal stress-only scan conferred the same low
likelihood of events in women as in men.

Myocardial perfusion imaging in women
 Hybrid SPECT with CT Imaging
An evolving body of literature supports the utility of
SPECT MPI combined with coronary artery calcium
(CAC)
scoring64–70
or
coronary
CT
angiography
(CCTA) to assess for the presence of stress-induced
myocardial ischemia along with coexistent calcified and
noncalcified atherosclerotic plaque. CAC can be visual-
ized not only on a dedicated high dose, breath-hold CT
scan, but also on the non-gated low dose CT scan
obtained for attenuation correction, although sensitivity
for detecting CAC may be reduced in the latter.71
Studies incorporating CAC scoring into SPECT
imaging highlight three key points. First, a CAC score of
0 is associated with low rates of ischemia among
symptomatic individuals (ischemia was noted in\
3% of
individuals with CAC score \
100)64,68 and in asymp-
tomatic diabetic individuals.67 In a recent trial of CAC
followed by selective downstream testing only in those
with detectable CAC,72 downstream testing was reduced
by 40% and no CAD events were observed through one
year of follow-up among those with a CAC score of 0.
Other literature, however, suggests that the risk of
patients with a CAC of 0 is heterogeneous, and driven
by underlying clinical risk.73 Second, the frequency of
ischemia increases with increasing CAC scores. Among
symptomatic patients, [
25% of individuals with CAC
score C1000 demonstrated ischemia.68 Third, as many
as 75% of individuals with normal MPI may have
underlying calcified coronary atherosclerosis.68 A high
CAC score with normal MPI portends a low risk of
short-term events (i.e., within the first 3 years), but a
higher risk of events in the intermediate- to long-term
(
[
3 years).64,67,69,70 While most of the above studies
included a large predominance of men, a recent large
study compared the prognostic value of CAC scoring
among asymptomatic, low-intermediate risk patients, of
whom 45.4% were women.74 In this study, women
compared to men were older, had a greater prevalence of
CAC, and a higher 15-year mortality. Although the
literature on CAC scoring combined with MPI in
symptomatic women is limited, these findings support
the addition of CAC in women to improve risk strati-
fication beyond traditional algorithms.
Several investigators have evaluated simultaneous
or sequential MPI and CCTA to identify the hemody-
namic significance of coronary stenoses detected on
CTA,
particularly
for
indeterminate
stenoses.75–77
Stress-only MPI with CTA has also been proposed as
a low-radiation dose protocol with comprehensive
ischemia and atherosclerosis imaging.78 An abnormal
SPECT MPI along with abnormal CTA was associated
with an annual death rate of 6%, and independently
associated
with
a
high
risk
of
death
and
MI
(P \ 0.005).79 However, to date, the results of these
studies do not identify any patient subgroup preferen-
tially benefiting from the use of combined MPI and
coronary atherosclerosis imaging protocols, and limited
data specific to women are available.
Solid-State Detector SPECT MPI
Novel solid-state detector cardiac SPECT scanners
demonstrate vastly improved count performance and
superior energy discrimination compared to conventional
NaI detector SPECT scanners.80 Solid-state scanners also
include advanced reconstruction methods of iterative
reconstruction, noise reduction, and resolution recovery
that enhance image quality and speed of acquisition, and
reduce radiation dose.80 Upright imaging (feasible with
some scanners) may change patterns of breast attenuation
or minimize attenuation artifacts in women. Dynamic
tomographic SPECT imaging is feasible with some of
these scanners, and under investigation for quantification
of myocardial perfusion reserve,81 which may be useful to
identify CMD. Enhancements allowing for high effi-
ciency and improved image quality make solid-state
detector SPECT particularly valuable for MPI in women.
Although limited literature exists on the diagnostic
accuracy of this technology in women or in general,82–84
one study showed that the diagnostic accuracy of solid-
state 99mTc-SPECT is high in women (area under receiver
operating characteristic [ROC] curve, 0.822 [95 % CI
0.685 to 0.959] and comparable to diagnostic accuracy in
men [overall ROC area 0.884, 95 % CI 0.836 to 0.933]).84
SPECT Summary Statement
Prompt evaluation of anginal symptoms in women
is critical to initiate guideline-directed strategies of care
aimed at improving IHD outcomes. SPECT MPI is
widely available with high diagnostic and prognostic
accuracy for women and men. Although ETT alone may
suffice in the evaluation of lower risk women with good
functional capacity and a normal rest ECG, SPECT MPI
is particularly effective for identification of women at
high risk of IHD events. Strategies are available to
address women-specific attenuation patterns, such as
those from large breasts or breast implants. Stress-first
(i.e., stress-only when normal) imaging with attenuation
correction is as effective in women as in men, and
should be preferentially utilized when appropriate.
Solid-state detector SPECT technology holds promise
to further enhance the utility of SPECT MPI for women
with improved throughput, superior image quality, and
potentially, the ability to quantify myocardial blood flow
for the assessment of diffuse CAD and CMD.

 PET MPI IN WOMEN FOR EVALUATION OF SIHD
Over the last decade, radionuclide MPI with PET
has become a powerful tool for the diagnosis and risk
stratification of patients with known or suspected
CAD.3,85 Here, we describe the maturing role of PET
imaging in women, particularly in the evaluation of
SIHD. PET imaging offers distinct advantages in the
evaluation of myocardial ischemia in women, such as
(1) improved diagnostic accuracy, (2) low-radiation
exposure using short-lived radiopharmaceuticals, and (3)
the ability to quantify myocardial blood flow and
coronary flow reserve to diagnose ischemia, even in
the absence of obstructive CAD. As such, cardiac PET
MPI stands to play a unique role in defining the
diagnosis and prognosis of women with SIHD, while
also guiding new treatment strategies for their more
prevalent cardiovascular disease phenotypes.
Diagnostic Accuracy of PET MPI in Women
For symptomatic intermediate risk women who are
capable of exercising and have an interpretable resting
ECG, the ETT remains the recommended initial diag-
nostic test.5 For the sizeable number of patients in whom
the addition of imaging is indicated, there are unique
characteristics of PET that make it particularly appeal-
ing for the evaluation of women. PET MPI has excellent
diagnostic performance for the detection of CAD and is
now performed in over 200 medical centers in the
United States and a growing number of centers world-
wide.85 Relative to conventional stress testing with
SPECT MPI or echocardiographic regional wall motion
assessment, PET MPI provides images of high diagnos-
tic quality and improved diagnostic accuracy, with an
average sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 89% for
detecting angiographically significant coronary ste-
noses.86
Recent
meta-analyses
have
confirmed
incremental improvement in diagnostic accuracy with
PET relative to SPECT for the diagnosis of obstructive
CAD,87,88 with an area under the ROC curve of 0.95 and
0.90 for PET and SPECT (P \ 0.0001).
Several
technical
advantages
account
for
the
enhanced diagnostic ability of PET. These include: (1)
routine measured (depth-independent) attenuation cor-
rection, which decreases false positives and thereby
increases specificity; (2) high spatial and contrast
resolution (heart-to-background ratio), which allows
improved detection of small perfusion defects, thereby
decreasing false negatives and increasing sensitivity; (3)
the use of short-lived radiopharmaceuticals, which
translate into very low-radiation doses as well as fast
sequential assessment of rest/stress perfusion imaging,
which allows for high laboratory efficiency and patient
throughput; and (4) high temporal resolution, which
allows for fast dynamic imaging of tracer kinetics and
makes possible the absolute quantification of myocardial
perfusion (in mL/min/g of tissue).85 In women, these
advantages may be especially relevant given: (1) the risk
of false positives due to attenuation from breast or
general adipose tissue in those with high BMI; (2) the
risk of false negatives due to partial volume effects,
which are amplified in small left ventricles; (3) the need
to minimize exposure to radiation, particularly among
women of reproductive age; and (4) a high prevalence of
nonobstructive CAD and CMD, which are not benign
phenotypes, but instead, increasingly recognized to be
associated with significant cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality.89,90
PET MPI allows for the evaluation of multiple
functional risk markers,85 including regional perfusion
defect size and severity, LVEF, TID of the left ventricle,
right ventricular tracer uptake, lung uptake, stress and
rest myocardial blood flow, and their ratio coronary flow
reserve, CFR. Selective incorporation of CT into hybrid
or sequential PET/CT imaging protocols, either with
quantification of CAC scoring or with CCTA, adds the
ability to evaluate for anatomical disease, thereby
increasing test sensitivity for diagnosis of CAD, includ-
ing nonobstructive plaque (Figure 3).3
Risk Stratification of Women with PET MPI
There are now extensive data from observational
studies supporting not only the diagnostic, but also the
prognostic value of PET MPI in women and men with
known or suspected CAD. The cumulative evidence in
more than 7,000 patients (
[
47% women), including
from the rubidium-82 (82Rb) PET Prognosis Multicenter
Registry, indicates that a normal scan is associated with
excellent prognosis, and that the magnitude of stress and
rest perfusion defects on PET MPI provides valuable
risk stratification of patients undergoing pharmacologic
stress testing.91–96 Specifically, a normal scan indicated
low risk (
\
1% annual cardiac event rate) while an
abnormal scan indicated worsening prognosis (
[
4.2%
annual event rate). There was a graded increase in risk of
CAD events with more extensive and severe perfusion
defects (predicted CAD death increased by one-third for
every 10% increase in percent myocardium ischemia,
and by more than one-half for every 10% increase in
percent myocardium scar); meaningful risk reclassifica-
tion for CAD death occurred for 1 in 9 patients.91 A sex-
specific analysis of the PET Prognosis Multicenter
Registry yielded similar results.97 Although there were
significant differences in clinical characteristics (i.e.,
women as compared to men had lower frequency of
prior CAD, higher frequency of normal scans, and

Myocardial perfusion imaging in women
 experienced lower rates of cardiac mortality), the
percentage of abnormal stress myocardium was inde-
pendently predictive of CAD mortality such that the
prognostic value of PET MPI was similar in women and
men (Figure 4A).97 The integration of perfusion and
function, enabled by the assessment of LVEF and
volumes with PET MPI, adds important prognostic
information that was found to be similar in women and
men (e.g., LVEF is inversely related to CAD mortality,
Figure 4B).97 Further, the possibility of assessing the
change in LVEF from baseline to peak vasodilator stress
(especially with the use of a short half-life tracer such as
82Rb for PET MPI) may also provide useful diagnostic
and prognostic data.98
Quantification of Coronary Blood Flow and
Reserve
An area where PET holds great promise to con-
tribute differentially to the evaluation of women with
symptoms of myocardial ischemia is in the quantifica-
tion of myocardial blood flow and reserve. Growing data
support that the pathophysiology of CAD in women may
vary as compared to men.35,89,90,99,100 Although women
frequently have less anatomical obstructive CAD, this
does not necessarily translate into fewer IHD events.101
A major contributor to this apparent paradox may be
vascular dysfunction in the form of abnormal coronary
reactivity due to diffuse endothelial dysfunction and
plaque erosion.34,102 Thus, testing for SIHD, especially
in women, needs to progress beyond testing for the
presence or absence of obstructive epicardial CAD. This
is where PET MPI with quantification of CFR may play
an important role. Coronary flow reserve (calculated as
the ratio of hyperemic to rest absolute myocardial blood
flow) is an integrated marker of coronary vasomotor
dysfunction that measures the hemodynamic effects of
focal, diffuse, and small-vessel coronary artery disease
on myocardial tissue perfusion,103 and is emerging as an
important noninvasive prognostic imaging marker of
cardiovascular
risk.
Recent
data
have
consistently
shown that CFR measurements by PET can distinguish
patients at low or high risk for serious adverse events,
including cardiac death,104–107 beyond comprehensive
clinical assessment, LVEF, or traditional semi-quantita-
tive
measures
of
stress-induced
ischemia.104,105 A
preserved CFR effectively excluded high-risk angio-
graphic CAD with a sensitivity of 86% and a negative
predictive value of 97% in patients with normal or
mildly to moderately abnormal (
\
10% LV ischemia
and/or scar) PET MPI.108 Conversely, an impaired CFR
of \
2 has been associated with a 3.4-fold increased
hazard of CAD death, and a severely impaired CFR 1.5
has been associated with a 5.6-fold increased risk of
CAD death.104 This continuum of cardiovascular risk is
illustrated in Figure 5.109 While a CFR value of C2 was
associated with relatively low rates of annualized
cardiac death, the event rate for patients with CFR
values
of
\
2
increased
exponentially
as
CFR
decreased.109,110 Thus, patients who doubled (or more)
their resting coronary blood flow during stress condi-
tions demonstrated a relatively good prognosis. For
patients with CFR \
2, prognosis may be substantially
worse,
but
not
necessarily
in
a
manner
directly
attributable to obstructive CAD. As CFR is a measure
of not only the effects of epicardial CAD, but also of
diffuse atherosclerosis and microvascular dysfunction
on myocardial tissue perfusion, worse prognosis in
patients with CFR \
2 may be associated with coronary
vasomotor dysfunction arising from a mix of patho-
physiologic CAD phenotypes. Indeed, impaired global
CFR is associated with major cardiovascular events
independently of coronary angiographic severity (Fig-
ure 6),
and
modifies
the
effect
of
coronary
revascularization.111
This may have important implications for women
with SIHD. There is emerging evidence that patients,
particularly women, with very low CFR may be at an
especially elevated risk of cardiovascular events. In a
clinical cohort of symptomatic patients referred for
invasive coronary angiography after PET MPI, women

 had a significantly lower burden of obstructive CAD
relative to men, but were not protected from cardiovas-
cular events,35 consistent with the previously described
epidemiologic trends.112,113 However, by further explor-
ing the contribution of PET-quantified CFR in this
cohort, Taqueti et al.35 arrived at new insights regarding
the interplay of sex, anatomical CAD severity, and
coronary vasomotor dysfunction on adverse events.
While most men with severely impaired CFR were
found to have C1 vessel CAD on coronary angiography,
most women with similarly impaired CFR demonstrated
B1 vessel CAD. Yet, despite a lower pretest probability
of CAD and a lower burden of diagnosed angiographic
CAD, women experienced a greater risk of cardiovas-
cular events as compared to men. In adjusted analysis, as
much as 40% of this observed ‘‘sex gap’’, or differential
effect of sex on outcomes, was mediated by CFR.35 This
implies that a very low CFR (
\
1.6) may be a critical link
to understanding the hidden biological risk of IHD
among women. Previous data from the same group
support that revascularization, especially by coronary
artery bypass surgery (CABG), in certain individuals
with severely impaired CFR may be beneficial.111 That
sex differences on outcomes of cardiovascular events are

Myocardial perfusion imaging in women
 amplified in those with severely impaired CFR (Fig-
ure 7)35 further suggests that certain patients (e.g., with
very low CFR and less obstructive CAD, a phenotype
more prevalent in women) may be at especially high
risk. Thus, while providing optimal, equitable guideline-
directed medical care remains a critical goal for
managing women with SIHD,5,112 additional research
is needed to determine precisely what that might be for
this subset of vulnerable patients with a predominance
of women.
These findings collectively highlight the morbidity
associated
with
diffuse
atherosclerosis
and
CMD.
Indeed, even in the setting of normal PET MPI (e.g.,
no flow-limiting CAD), impaired CFR adds important
prognostic value. In a lower risk cohort of symptomatic
patients with normal semi-quantitative MPI by PET and
less severely reduced CFR, CFR but not sex was
independently associated with major adverse cardiovas-
cular events.114 That is, both women and men with
CMD (CFR \
2 in the presence of normal MPI)
experienced worse outcomes, although this phenotype
was twice as prevalent in women as in men. This result
was consistent even in patients with a CAC score of
0,114 and global CFR, but not CAC, provided significant
incremental risk stratification over clinical risk score for
prediction of major adverse CAD events.115 Thus,
symptomatic patients who do not demonstrate ischemia
associated with flow-limiting CAD may have diffuse
atherosclerosis and CMD for which a more sensitive,
quantitative assessment of ischemia may better diagnose
abnormalities and identify novel targets for systemic
therapies. Although this is not a uniquely female
disorder, this pattern of abnormalities may be especially
relevant in certain subsets of women, including those
with diabetes and/or metabolic syndrome, low-de-
tectable levels of cardiac troponin,116 heart failure with
preserved LVEF (HFpEF),117 atrial fibrillation, and
those following chemotherapy and radiation from breast
cancer or Hodgkin’s lymphoma, respectively.
Novel Cardiac PET Applications
Finally, the clinical indications for cardiac PET
imaging in women extend beyond coronary blood flow
to molecular and cellular events in the myocardium.
Examples of this include the use of fluorine-18 (18F)-
fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET in the evaluation of
hibernating myocardium in patients with ischemic car-
diomyopathy,118 and in the evaluation of inflammatory
infiltrate in patients with suspected or known cardiac
sarcoidosis.119
PET Summary Statement
Quantitative PET holds the potential to elucidate the
distinct pathophysiology of IHD in women, while also
improving diagnostic accuracy and reducing patient expo-
sure to radiation relative to traditional approaches. As such,
PET MPI represents a significant contribution to the patient-
centered evaluation of myocardial ischemia across the
various CAD phenotypesprevalent in both women and men.
MPI AS GATEKEEPER TO QUALITY TESTING
PATTERNS IN WOMEN: FOCUS ON TEST
EFFICIENCY, COST EFFECTIVENESS, AND
RADIATION DOSE REDUCTION
A core component of appropriate identification of
patients and the ensuing test-driven strategies must
include consideration of costs associated with the
diagnostic episode of care. Critical cost issues for
cardiovascular imaging include layered or sequential
testing patterns as well as the cost consequences of
comparative testing patterns over both the near- and
long-term duration of care.120 The appropriate selection
of patients can markedly reduce the need for additional
testing, largely through eliminating testing for those
with rarely appropriate indications.121
Test Efficiency and Cost Effectiveness of
MPI in Women
Few studies examine the cost efficiency or cost
effectiveness of MPI, with even less focusing on

 women. A large observational study of 11,372 patients
with stable angina revealed that a selective ischemia-
driven approach using SPECT MPI prior to invasive
coronary angiography provided substantial cost savings
without significant differences in clinical outcomes
compared to a strategy of direct invasive coronary
angiography.122 A subanalysis of 4,638 women from
this study demonstrated that MPI followed by selective
angiography minimized near-term costs compared to
direct invasive coronary angiography regardless of
pretest likelihood of CAD.123 A similar analysis was
reported and projected additional cost savings associated
with PET MPI compared with SPECT MPI.124 In
another observational registry of 9,521 symptomatic
women, exercise SPECT MPI provided incremental cost
effectiveness compared to echocardiography among
women with established CAD, or women at high risk
of CAD events (C2% annual risk).125
The WOMEN trial evaluated the cost efficiency of
exercise SPECT MPI versus ETT in women with low to
intermediate risk.15 In this randomized trial, 824 symp-
tomatic women with low-intermediate pretest likelihood
of IHD and a Duke Activity Status Index of C5
metabolic equivalents (METS) were randomized to a
strategy of ETT alone or ETT with SPECT MPI. An
initial diagnostic strategy of ETT alone resulted in a
similar 2-year outcome of major adverse CAD events
(CAD death, hospitalization for an acute coronary
syndrome, or heart failure), and 48% diagnostic cost
savings (P \ 0.001) compared to exercise MPI.15

 Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain
(PROMISE) trial evaluated 10,003 patients (52.7%
women) randomized to stress testing (67.3% with stress
SPECT MPI) or CCTA with the results reporting similar
rates of adverse events (death, acute coronary syn-
dromes, or procedural complications) by randomized
test strategy (P = 0.75).126 In this trial, the cumulative
3-year costs were similar for patients randomized to
stress testing versus CCTA.127 Although the estimated
cost of index testing with CCTA was lower than that
with an initial functional strategy (including ETT alone,
stress MPI, or stress echocardiography), CCTA use was
associated with more downstream catheterizations and
revascularizations, leading to similar costs averaged
over follow-up time. These results have implications for
the largely community-based enrollment of the PRO-
MISE trial, where 3-year costs were similar across
diagnostic test modalities and support similar evaluation
and care costs for a functional versus anatomical testing
strategy in a heterogeneous population of patients with
suspected CAD. However, given the high prevalence of
nonobstructive CAD in symptomatic women,128 and the
higher rate of invasive coronary angiography for CCTA
in the PROMISE trial, more research is warranted to
determine the added contribution of detecting flow-
limiting atherosclerotic plaques or small-vessel ische-
mia. This underscores the critical need for randomized
and comparative trial data in female patients.
Radiation Dose Reduction with MPI in
Women
Awareness of a large rise in population exposure to
ionizing radiation from medical diagnostic procedures
over the last three decades129 has led to concerns about
downstream cancer risk, particularly among younger
patients and women (Figure 8).130,131 This has resulted
in renewed focus on efforts to decrease patient radiation
doses to levels that are as low as reasonably achievable
(ALARA). The exposure of women and men to ionizing
radiation has been the focus of several documents from
ASNC on patient-centered imaging (see summary of
effective doses in Table 2).132–135 For the clinician,
concern exists as to whether women have an increased
projected cancer risk associated with radiation exposure
when compared to men. However, recent estimates do
not demonstrate a differential risk from MPI in women
as compared to men,136 particularly when AUC are
followed.137 A number of consensus statements are
available on this subject,130,138 including those from
ASNC.132,133,139
Methods to reduce radiation exposure:
Patient testing. The exposure to radiation of patients
undergoing a medical diagnostic evaluation is justified
only in the setting of appropriate procedural use and
optimized dose-reduction strategies. With regard to the
former, issues regarding radiation exposure are depen-
dent on the clinical benefit of testing and the evidentiary
standards supporting the clinical indication for testing.
To reduce unnecessary testing and radiation exposure,
the ACC’s AUC or the American College of Radiol-
ogy’s
Appropriateness
Criteria,
as
detailed
above,
provide primary means for justification of procedural
use.9,16 Data suggest that performing testing in patients
outside these accepted criteria (rarely appropriate)
results in a very low diagnostic yield, as the vast
percentage of studies is normal.140,141 Thus, the princi-
pal means of reducing radiation exposure among women
is to restrict utilization of MPI to those meeting
appropriate indications for testing.
With regard to the latter, minimizing radiation
exposure for patients is of considerable importance for
optimal patient safety, regardless of sex. All clinicians
involved in the patient’s care must be involved in this
process, from the healthcare provider ordering the test to
the nuclear cardiologist performing and interpreting the
test, to whom responsibility ultimately falls for selecting
testing protocols, equipment, and tracers. ASNC has
advocated that the median patient dose per study should
be \
9 millisieverts (mSv).132 The next section will
highlight specific methods to reduce radiation dose, such
as the use of stress-only imaging or the expanded

 application of cardiac PET MPI, to aid any laboratory in
achieving ASNC goals. Recent worldwide surveys from
the International Atomic Energy Agency-sponsored
(IAEA) Nuclear Cardiology Protocols Cross-Sectional
Study (INCAPS) registry suggest that there is consid-
erable
room
for
improvement
in
radiation
dose-
reduction practices for both women and men.142 From
the INCAPS registry, including 7,911 patients from 65
countries, mean effective dose was slightly lower for
women (9.6 mSv) as compared to men (10.3 mSv;
P \ 0.001). While stress-only MPI was performed more
often in women than in men (12.5% versus 8.4%;
P \ 0.001),
camera-based
dose-reduction
strategies
were used less frequently in women than in men (59%
versus 66%; P \ 0.0001). These data support that
additional improvements in radiation dose reduction
are possible for both women and men.
Methods to reduce radiation exposure:
Imaging protocols. The most widely utilized tracers
are
99mTc based, with a typical rest/stress protocol
resulting in an effective dose ranging from 8 to 16 mSv.
By comparison, MPI protocols involving 201Tl are in the
11 to 23 mSv range.143 Because of this increased
exposure to ionizing radiation without added benefit in
diagnostic or prognostic accuracy, the use of 201Tl or
dual-isotope (rest:
201Tl/stress:
99mTc) protocols is
discouraged for most patients by ASNC consensus
statements.139,143 Nonetheless, surveys indicate that
201Tl remains an isotope commonly utilized in the
United States.144–148 An immediate method to reduce
radiation exposure, therefore, is to eliminate 201Tl use as
a primary imaging tracer in all laboratories, as recom-
mended by ASNC.139
Stress-only or stress-first imaging. In most
laboratories, a patient undergoes the rest study first,
followed by stress, despite data that only 9% to 34% of
studies performed are positive for ischemia or infarc-
tion.149,150 Thus, performing the stress as the initial
imaging study (particularly with attenuation correction
techniques), and the rest only when needed may be a
reasonable means of increasing laboratory efficiency and
reducing patient radiation exposure in the appropriately
selected patient. Regardless of whether the initial stress
dose is high (24 to 30 millicuries, mCi) or low (8 to
12 mCi), substantial radiation reduction is achieved by
avoidance of the rest study.62,151–157 Despite the over-
whelming data supporting stress before rest, currently
only a small proportion of laboratories are using this
protocol.14,142,144
Image processing and software for exist-
ing systems. New advances have demonstrated that
using software to enhance image quality for existing
cameras
can
also
reduce
radiation
exposure
by
decreasing isotope dosage by approximately 25%-
75%.80,158,159 Replacement of filtered back projection
with iterative reconstruction (ordered subset expectation
minimization, OSEM) potentially requires 25% to 75%
less counts to produce similar images.160 Wide-beam
reconstruction and similar software solutions compen-
sate for the complicated beam angles and spread of
counts when reconstructing the image, and can achieve
high-image quality with reduced radiation.161 Algo-
rithms that combine multiple levels of processing by
utilizing OSEM, noise reduction algorithms, collimator
design, scatter modeling, and attenuation correction can
produce high-quality images during half-time acquisi-
tion. Data from a variety of studies have demonstrated
that these applications result in excellent image quality
with per-patient radiation exposure in the range of 4 to
8 mSv.80,158
New camera systems. Consideration for poten-
tial radiation reduction should be a factor
when
purchasing new equipment. In contrast to standard
Anger sodium iodine (NaI) cameras, new solid-state
detectors have been developed which utilize CZT arrays.
Data suggest that higher count sensitivity of CZT
cameras can produce images of comparable diagnostic
quality
with
15%
to
30%
of
standard
radiation
doses.162–164 Ultra-low-dose protocols involving the
use of stress-first imaging in appropriately selected
patients with CZT cameras have led to substantial
reductions in effective radiation exposure, to as low as
1 mSv per study.165,166
PET MPI to reduce radiation exposure. A
major strength of PET imaging, especially for the
evaluation of the female patient, is that enhanced image
quality and diagnostic capability are feasible while
limiting patient exposure to ionizing radiation. Rest/
stress perfusion imaging using the PET radiopharma-
ceuticals 82Rb or nitrogen-13 (13N) ammonia, with half-
lives of 1.2 and 9.8 minutes, respectively, results in an
effective dose of radiation at or below annual back-
ground exposure levels (B3 mSv) (Table 2).5 This is
significantly lower than that associated with a rest/stress
conventional SPECT study using 99mTc (&11 mSv) or
with
diagnostic
invasive
coronary
angiography
(&7 mSv), and commensurate with ALARA principles
as recommended by the Joint Commission on Diagnostic
Imaging for cardiac imaging procedures.129,167

exposure in women undergoing MPI are detailed in

 COMPARATIVE TRIAL EVIDENCE OF MPI
VERSUS OTHER APPROACHES IN SIHD
There have been numerous randomized trials of
imaging in the evaluation of suspected SIHD published
in the last several years, many of which included the use
of stress MPI imaging.15,168–170 As already briefly
described, the WOMEN trial randomized 824 symp-
tomatic women to a strategy of index exercise ECG
versus exercise SPECT MPI.15 At 2 years of follow-up,
there were no differences in the rate of CAD death, MI,
or hospitalization for acute coronary syndromes or heart
failure (1.7% in the exercise ECG arm versus 2.3% in
the exercise SPECT MPI arm, P = 0.59). Nearly 1 in 5
women randomized to the exercise ECG arm had a
follow-up SPECT MPI scan, largely, for those with
indeterminate or positive test results. Findings from this
trial revealed that a first strategy of exercise ECG
followed by selective SPECT MPI can effectively
manage low-risk women. Sizeable cost savings were
achieved using this approach of the exercise ECG first
compared to index SPECT MPI testing, with a cost
savings for the diagnostic evaluation of approximately
$300 (P \ 0.0001).
In a secondary analysis from the single-center
Clinical Evaluation of MAgnetic Resonance imaging in
Coronary heart disease (CE-MARC) trial, 235 women
underwent adenosine SPECT MPI, a multiparametric
cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR)
examination (including balanced steady-state free pre-
cession cine imaging, rest/stress perfusion, 3D CMR
angiography, and late gadolinium enhancement), and
invasive coronary angiography.168,171 The results indi-
cated a sensitivity and specificity for SPECT MPI of
59% and 84% versus 89% and 84% for the multipara-
metric CMR (P \ 0.0001 and P = 0.77, respectively.
This higher accuracy of CMR is likely attributable to
single-site expertise, but requires further validation with
a comprehensive nuclear examination, which is consid-
ered the standard of care in diagnostic testing. In a
related example from the PROMISE trial, community-
based interpretation of stress test findings (67% stress
MPI) resulted in a 2.1-year rate of death, MI, or
hospitalization for unstable angina of 5.1% and 1.9% for
women with positive and negative stress-test findings
(P \ 0.0001).169,170 These data support that a multicen-
ter, community-based interpretation can effectively
stratify risk in women, a strong statement for the
accuracy of MPI testing across the United States.
Several recent randomized trials have compared
stress testing approaches to CCTA strategies of care,
revealing no statistically significant difference in out-
come over the nearly 2 years of follow-up for both the
Scottish COmputed Tomography of the HEART (SCOT-
HEART) and PROMISE trials.126,172 This supports that
contemporary diagnostic testing practices including MPI
are effective for evaluating patients with SIHD. Findings
from these two trials revealed a lower rate of follow-up
invasive angiography in those undergoing stress testing;
which was performed prior to randomization in 85% of
patients in the SCOT-HEART trial. For example, in the
PROMISE trial, the rate of invasive coronary angiog-
raphy was 12.2% in the CCTA arm and 8.1% in the
stress testing arm (P = 0.022). Moreover, the rate of
coronary revascularization was nearly twofold higher in
the CCTA arm as compared to the stress testing arm
within
the
PROMISE
trial
(6.2%
versus
3.2%).
Although stress testing included evaluations with and
without imaging, these data support the use of functional
testing approaches as gatekeepers to invasive angiogra-
phy and selective revascularization, and are consistent
with ischemia-guided management. In a secondary
analysis from the PROMISE trial, no difference in the

perfusion imaging
1. Use AUC to guide patient selection for nuclear cardiology procedures.
2. Use technetium-based tracers for SPECT MPI studies. Avoid use of thallium-based and dual-isotope SPECT
protocols.
3. Consider stress-first MPI (especially with attenuation correction techniques) for select patients without evidence
of prior MI or cardiomyopathy.
4. Implement iterative reconstruction algorithms for use with existing SPECT technology.
5. Use high-sensitivity solid-state CZT SPECT cameras and/or PET MPI where available.
6. Continually review nuclear laboratory practices to implement dose-reduction strategies to decrease patient
radiation doses to levels that are as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) and approaching levels of natural
background radiation (3 mSV/year) whenever possible.

Recently, the CE-MARC 2 trial provided further
evidence for the comparative effectiveness of CMR
versus SPECT MPI.174 In 1,202 symptomatic patients
(46.9% women) with a mean pretest likelihood of
49.5%, reduction in unnecessary angiography when
compared to the National Institute of Health and Care
Excellence (NICE) guidelines was similarly low with
SPECT (16.2% [95% CI, 13.0% to 19.8%] as well as
CMR (17.7% [95% CI, 14.4% to 21.4%]).175
It is important to note that enrollment of women in
clinical trials and in clinical research in general is often
lower than optimal. The recent studies highlighted above
serve to remind the scientific community of the impor-
tance of active recruitment of women into clinical trials.
Doing so may allow sex-specific data to become
available and to facilitate identification of potentially
unique differences among women and men, depending
on the specifics of trial or registry design. Women-only
trials in SIHD should also be encouraged, especially for
those phenotypes that appear to be particularly prevalent
in women, including symptomatic nonobstructive CAD
and HFpEF.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS: SIHD WITHOUT
OBSTRUCTIVE CAD
The future of MPI for women with suspected or
known SIHD must include an increased emphasis on
strategies to ensure low-radiation exposure, a high
degree of accuracy, and defining strategies of care for
women with and without obstructive CAD. Technical
improvements in image quality for women, including for
obese patients, are critical for accurate diagnostic and
prognostic evaluation of this large sector of the U.S.
population. Focused research must reveal the degree to
which PET (or possibly SPECT) MPI with CFR may
identify women with angiographically normal coronary
arteries with definable CMD, which may occur either in
the presence or absence of obstructive CAD or myocar-
dial diseases.176 More so for women than men, there is a
large pool of patients with nonobstructive and obstruc-
tive

 atherosclerosis plaque features—may benefit from the
addition of CFR to correlate with their symptom
burden and future IHD risk is unknown, but constitutes
a worthwhile research goal. Understanding the contri-
bution
of
functional
and
anatomical
parameters
associated with CAD is likely to represent the key to
devising optimal evaluation algorithms for women with
SIHD. As such, strategies are needed not only to detect
atherosclerosis
and
its
functional
significance
in
women, but also to guide treatment of women with
functionally and prognostically significant nonobstruc-
tive or less severely obstructive CAD (Figure 9).
Recent treatment trials of women with suspected
CMD have largely been negative.181 Ongoing efforts
are focused on defining the distinct clinical syndrome
of angina or ischemia with no obstructive CAD
(INOCA),182 as well as identifying current knowledge
gaps and next steps for developing evidence-based
therapies. With the advent of PET/CT (as hybrid or
serial imaging), multiparametric imaging approaches
may be possible to integrate MPI and CFR with
anatomical atherosclerotic plaque to uniquely identify
at-risk women.
CONCLUSIONS
IHD poses a major threat to women across their
lifespans, and we are only beginning to recognize the
importance of expanding conventional tools developed
more than a half-century ago for the diagnosis and
management of (primarily obstructive) CAD, to IHD in
women. Women with ongoing chest pain due to either
obstructive or nonobstructive coronary disease have
increased mortality compared to asymptomatic patients
with disease. This updated consensus statement provides
a state-of-the-art review on the available evidence of the
role of MPI for the evaluation of stable IHD in
symptomatic women.
The ACC’s multimodality AUC document outlines
imaging methods for the detection and risk assessment
of SIHD in men and women and indications for invasive
coronary angiography.9 For women, the evidence base
for SPECT and PET MPI is robust and supports accurate
detection of obstructive CAD, effective risk stratifica-
tion, and hopefully more appropriate utilization of
invasive procedures. Integration of multiple parameters,
particularly the addition of CFR and CT, into an MPI

strategies (i.e., prospective ECG-gated CT, avoidance of dual-isotope and 201TI SPECT protocols,
and preference for CZT and stress-only SPECT, or PET) are utilized whenever possible. **In cases
where an anatomical strategy (i.e., CCTA or invasive coronary angiography) demonstrates absence
of obstructive CAD, consider PET-CFR evaluation for coronary microvascular dysfunction. ***If
nonobstructive CAD and/or coronary microvascular dysfunction is present, refer for guideline-
directed therapies (where paucity of data and guidelines suggests more research is needed to define
optimal therapies).
