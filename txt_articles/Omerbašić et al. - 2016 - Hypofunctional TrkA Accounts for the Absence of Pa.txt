SUMMARY
The naked mole-rat is a subterranean rodent lacking
several pain behaviors found in humans, rats, and
mice. For example, nerve growth factor (NGF), an
important mediator of pain sensitization, fails to pro-
duce thermal hyperalgesia in naked mole-rats. The
sensitization of capsaicin-sensitive TRPV1 ion chan-
nels is necessary for NGF-induced hyperalgesia, but
naked mole-rats have fully functional TRPV1 chan-
nels. We show that exposing isolated naked mole-
rat nociceptors to NGF does not sensitize TRPV1.
However, the naked mole-rat NGF receptor TrkA dis-
plays a reduced ability to engage signal transduction
pathways that sensitize TRPV1. Between one- and
three-amino-acid substitutions in the kinase domain
of the naked mole-rat TrkA are sufficient to render the
receptor hypofunctional, and this is associated with
the absence of heat hyperalgesia. Our data suggest
that evolution has selected for a TrkA variant that
abolishes a robust nociceptive behavior in this spe-
cies but is still compatible with species fitness.
INTRODUCTION
Inflammation and tissue injury cause hypersensitivity of the
affected tissue so that mild mechanical and thermal stimuli
become painful. This phenomenon is called hyperalgesia (Lewin
et al., 2014; Smith and Lewin, 2009). A critical endogenous medi-
ator of inflammatory thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia, both
in rodents and in humans, is nerve growth factor (NGF). Early
studies in rodents and humans revealed that a single local
dose of exogenous recombinant NGF can produce profound
and long-lasting thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia (Dyck
et al., 1997; Lewin and Mendell, 1993; Lewin et al., 1993; Petty
et al., 1994). Furthermore, loss of function mutations in the
NGF gene or NTRK1, which encodes the high-affinity NGF re-
ceptor TrkA, cause a range of congenital pain insensitivity syn-
dromes in humans (Carvalho et al., 2011; Einarsdottir et al.,
2004; Indo et al., 1996). The NGF/TrkA signaling system is critical
for the genesis and maintenance of hypersensitivity states in
mammals (Lewin et al., 1994, 2014; Woolf et al., 1994). The
importance of increased NGF signaling during pain has recently
been reinforced by the fact that blocking NGF signaling appears
to be highly effective in treating pain in humans on the basis of
phase 2 clinical trial data (Katz et al., 2011; Lane et al., 2010).
The naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber) is a eusocial
African rodent that displays a range of extreme physiological
characteristics from cancer resistance and extreme longevity
to complete insensitivity to acid (Liang et al., 2010; O’Connor
et al., 2002; Park et al., 2008; Smith et al., 2011; Schuhmacher
et al., 2015). We discovered that this species completely lacks
behavioral heat hyperalgesia when challenged with NGF and
the pro-inflammatory agents capsaicin and complete Freund’s
adjuvant (Park et al., 2008). The polymodal, capsaicin-gated
ion channel TRPV1 is also required in mice for the development
of NGF-induced heat hyperalgesia (Chuang et al., 2001). How-
ever, our studies have shown that although naked mole-rats
are behaviorally insensitive to capsaicin, they have sensory neu-
rons that express a TRPV1 channel with ligand sensitivity and
biophysical properties indistinguishable from that found in
mice or humans (Smith et al., 2011). Here, we investigated how
heat hyperalgesia has been disabled in the naked mole-rat
over the course of evolution. We addressed this question using
molecular and cellular approaches to dissect out at which stage
of the sensitization pathway heat sensitization fails. A cellular
model of heat hyperalgesia is the rapid and potent sensitization
of TRPV1 currents that has been studied in isolated sensory neu-
rons (Shu and Mendell, 2001). We show that rapid sensitization
of TRPV1-mediated currents is absent in sensory neurons from
naked mole-rats. However, the naked mole-rat TRPV1 protein
can be sensitized when expressed in mouse sensory neurons.
We show that the cloned naked mole-rat TrkA receptor is less
efficient at engaging signal transduction pathways leading to
TRPV1 sensitization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that unique
amino acid variants in the kinase domain of the naked mole-rat

 TrkA receptor likely render the receptor hypofunctional. Thus,
millions of years of evolution appear to have led to an effi-
cient and possibly single-molecule change that disables heat
hyperalgesia.
RESULTS
TRPV1 Is Not Sensitized by NGF in Naked Mole-Rat
Nociceptors
We made whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from isolated
mouse and naked mole-rat sensory neurons live-labeled with flu-
orescently tagged isolectin B4 (IB4). IB4 predominantly binds to
non-peptidergic small-diameter sensory neurons in mice, while
TrkA immunoreactivity is specific to peptidergic sensory neurons
that do not bind IB4 (Averill et al., 1995). Immunohistochemistry
confirmed that IB4-negative sensory neurons are TrkA positive in
mouse and naked mole-rat, but as in the rat (Price and Flores,
2007), some naked mole-rat TrkA-positive neurons were IB4
positive (Figure 1A). We also immunostained cultured naked
mole-rat sensory neurons and found that 50% (34/68 cells)
were TrkA positive while 35% (24/68) were IB4 positive, and
only a small proportion of TrkA-positive cells were IB4 positive
(15% [5/34]). We thus focused our analysis on IB4-negative neu-
rons to increase the likelihood of recording from naked mole-rat
sensory neurons that possess TrkA receptors. The ability of NGF
to rapidly sensitize TRPV1 was measured by comparing capsa-
icin-evoked current amplitudes before and after a 5-min NGF
superfusion (100 ng/mL). As in rat sensory neurons (Shu and
Mendell, 1999), there was a substantial increase in the average
size of the capsaicin-evoked current (>2-fold) after acute NGF
treatment of IB4-negative mouse sensory neurons (Figure 1B).
However, in naked mole-rat IB4-negative sensory neurons,
NGF never sensitized TRPV1 currents (Figure 1C). In order to
confirm these results we also performed calcium imaging on iso-
lated mouse and naked mole-rat sensory neurons. Given that
both capsaicin and calcium influx cause desensitization and ta-
chyphylaxis of TRPV1 (Koplas et al., 1997; Lishko et al., 2007),
we applied five consecutive pulses (100 nM capsaicin, 30 s
pulse) in order to obtain stable calcium signals before exposing
the neurons to NGF (Hanack et al., 2015), followed by the sixth
capsaicin pulse (Figures 1D and 1E). In mouse sensory neurons,
NGF caused robust sensitization of capsaicin responses, but no
increase in calcium influx was observed in naked mole-rat sen-
sory neurons (Figure 1F). Thus, the absence of behavioral signs
of NGF-induced heat hyperalgesia in the naked mole-rat (Park
et al., 2008) can be accounted for by molecular changes, intrinsic

 to naked mole-rat nociceptors, that have disabled NGF sensiti-
zation of TRPV1.
The cloned naked mole-rat TRPV1 receptor (nmrTrpv1) dis-
plays biophysical properties similar to its mouse counterpart
with respect to proton, capsaicin, and heat gating (Smith et al.,
2011). It is, however, possible that the naked mole-rat TRPV1
protein cannot be phosphorylated on critical residues that are
required for full sensitization. Several conserved amino acid
residues that can be phosphorylated within the TRPV1 molecule
have been shown to be important for sensitization (Bhave et al.,
2003; Chuang et al., 2001; Prescott and Julius, 2003; Zhang
et al., 2005); however, all but one of these residues were
conserved in nmrTrpv1 (Figure S1A). Thus, Ser502 (numbering
for ratTrpv1), a normally conserved residue involved in protein ki-
nase C epsilon type (PKCε)-mediated sensitization (Numazaki
et al., 2002), was substituted by a threonine in the naked mole-
rat protein. By using the phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate ester
(PMA) to activate PKCε in cells transfected with ratTrpv1,
we observed robust sensitization using calcium imaging as
the readout (Figure S1B). To measure PKCε sensitization of
nmrTRPV1, we used a new naked mole-rat fibroblast cell line
(Figure S1C) to enable recording of PKCε-mediated sensitization
of nmrTRPV1 in its native environment, which was robustly
observed (Figure S1D). We also generated a naked mole-rat
TRPV1T502S mutant that was also sensitized by PMA in naked
mole-rat fibroblast cell lines (Figure S1E) and conclude that in
terms of TRPV1 sensitization, threonine is functionally equivalent
to serine at position 502.
To demonstrate more directly that naked mole-rat TRPV1 is
fully capable of being sensitized, we expressed it in mouse sen-
sory neurons from Trpv1�/� mice. Using an Alexa-Fluor-568-

Figure 2. Naked Mole-Rat TRPV1 Currents
Can Be Sensitized by NGF
(A) Naked mole-rat Trpv1 cDNA was transfected
into DRG neurons originating from Trpv1�/� mice.
(B) Trpv1�/� DRG neurons expressing naked mole-
rat TRPV1 channels were identified by co-trans-
fection with EGFP; IB4-568 labeling allowed tar-
geting of TrkA-positive neurons. Scale bar, 50 mm.
(C) NGF potentiates naked mole-rat TRPV1-
mediated capsaicin currents in IB4-negative, but
not IB4-positive, Trpv1�/� DRG neurons.
(D) In CHO cells co-expressing rat Trpv1/rat
TrkA, NGF sensitized capsaicin responses, unlike
in control cells.
(E) Naked mole-rat fibroblast cells expressing
naked mole-rat Trpv1/ratTrkA were sensitized by
NGF when compared to controls.
Sensitization in (D) and (E) was scored if change in
[Ca2+]i intensity > (mean + 2 SD) of controls (dotted
lines in lefthand panels). Mann-Whitney U test was
used in (C) and chi-square test in (D) and (E) (*p <
0.05; ***p < 0.001). Data in (C) are presented as
mean ± SEM.
conjugated IB4, mouse Trpv1�/� IB4-
negative sensory neurons were selected
by their green fluorescence after trans-
fection with plasmids encoding EGFP
and the naked mole-rat Trpv1 cDNA (Figures 2A and 2B). We
used whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology to demonstrate
that capsaicin-evoked currents are present in transfected
Trpv1�/� sensory neurons and that these currents could be
sensitized by NGF (Figure 2C). In contrast, no sensitization of
the capsaicin current in mouse IB4-positive sensory neurons
was observed presumably because of the absence of TrkA in
these cells (Figures 2C and 1A). Transfected Trpv1�/� sensory
neurons had heat-gated currents with an activation threshold
of 44.4�C ± 0.7�C (n = 5) and pH-gated currents sensitive to
ruthenium red (Figure S1F). Heat-activated currents are reported
to be otherwise rare in Trpv1�/� sensory neurons (Caterina et al.,
2000). Thus, the naked mole-rat TRPV1 protein can rescue
capsaicin and heat sensitivity in Trpv1�/� sensory neurons with
a heat-activation threshold concomitant with the heat-activation
threshold of nmrTRPV1 (Smith et al., 2011) and is fully capable of
NGF initiated sensitization in the mouse cellular context.
Rapid TRPV1 sensitization via NGF activation of TrkA re-
ceptors can be reconstituted in human and animal-derived
cell lines as well as Xenopus laevis oocytes (Bonnington and
McNaughton, 2003; Prescott and Julius, 2003; Zhang et al.,
2005). It is possible that TRPV1 sensitization by NGF cannot
take place in the naked mole-rat cellular context. We used cal-
cium imaging to measure TRPV1 sensitization after Chinese
hamster ovary (CHO) cells were transfected with ratTrpv1/
ratTrkA. In control experiments, ratTrkA was either not trans-
fected or buffer instead of NGF was superfused between the
capsaicin pulses. NGF produced a robust sensitization with
29.5% of capsaicin-responsive CHO cells showing increased
calcium signals post-NGF compared to just 4.5% in controls
(Figure 2D). Similarly, using naked mole-rat fibroblast cells
750
Cell Reports 17, 748–758, October 11, 2016
 co-transfected with nmrTrpv1/ratTrkA, 19.8% of capsaicin-
responsive naked mole-rat fibroblast cells showed increased
calcium signals post-NGF compared to just 3.5% in con-
trols (Figure 2E). These data indicate that naked mole-rat
cells possess the necessary signaling components for TRPV1
sensitization.
Naked Mole-Rat TrkA Is Hypofunctional
We cloned the naked mole-rat TrkA cDNA from mRNA isolated
from sensory neurons (nmrTrkA). The nmrTrkA sequence was
identical to that predicted from the naked mole-rat genome as-
sembly (Keane et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2011). The predicted
naked mole-rat TrkA peptide sequence was aligned with orthol-
ogous sequences from 26 other mammalian species (Figure S2).
There was significant sequence divergence in the extracel-
lular TrkA domains, including the juxtamembrane NGF-binding
domain; however, the intracellular sequences within the kinase
domain were highly conserved (Figure S2B). All tyrosine residues
important for receptor activation were conserved in all the spe-
cies, including the naked mole-rat. We reasoned that at least
some of the amino acid variants in the kinase domain of nmrTrkA
may be common variants found in African mole-rats (family Bath-
yergidae). In order to screen for such variants, we obtained TrkA
sequences from five further African mole-rat species: the Dam-
araland mole-rat (Fukomys damarensis), the Mashona mole-
rat (Fukomys darlingi), the giant mole-rat (Fukomys mechowii),
the Natal mole-rat (Cryptomys hottentotus natalensis), and
Emin’s mole-rat (Heliophobius emini) (Figure S3A). We used
genomic DNA from these species to PCR amplify the exonic re-
gions of the TrkA gene, guided by variants found in nmrTrkA.
However, we also assembled TrkA transcripts from published
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from African mole-rat species
(Davies et al., 2015). In addition, we obtained RNA from the
brains of three Mashona mole-rats and performed RNA-seq fol-
lowed by de novo transcriptome assembly (Table S1). An African
mole-rat phylogeny was constructed including the new tran-
scriptome data from the Mashona mole-rat (Figure S3C), and
this was in close agreement with previous analyses that had
not included this species (Davies et al., 2015). Alignment of the
available predicted TrkA amino acid sequences from African
mole-rats revealed that the nmrTrkA kinase domain has accumu-
lated at least three amino acid variants that are either absent or
rare in the animal kingdom, including African mole-rats (Fig-
ure S3B). There was just one amino acid change that appeared
to be unique to naked mole-rat, which was a leucine (rat) to
cysteine substitution at position 774 (Figure S2B). The accumu-
lation of amino acid variants in the nmrTrkA kinase domain
encouraged us to carry out a functional analysis of the ability
of this receptor to participate in nociceptor sensitization. To do
this, we tested the ability of the naked mole-rat TrkA receptor
to sensitize TRPV1 using electrophysiology with X. laevis oo-
cytes as the heterologous expression system. Oocytes were in-
jected with a ratTrpv1cRNA and cRNAs coding for either ratTrkA
or nmrTrkA. We observed that 1 mM capsaicin causes substantial
and long-lasting desensitization of TRPV1 currents in oocytes
and thus decided to record proton-gated TRPV1 currents to
quantify NGF sensitization, as others have done (Zhang et al.,
2005). Using a two-electrode voltage clamp, we showed that
an acidic stimulus (pH 5.8) produced robust inward currents in
TRPV1-expressing oocytes that were absent in non-injected oo-
cytes (data not shown). In oocytes injected with ratTrkA and
ratTrpv1 cRNA, superfusion of NGF (100 ng/mL, 5 min) caused
a robust sensitization of acid-gated currents (Figure 3B). How-
ever, the same NGF concentration produced a significantly
smaller sensitization of TRPV1 currents in oocytes injected
with nmrTrkA and ratTrpv1 cRNA (Figures 3B and 3E). Compara-
ble amounts of rat and naked mole-rat TrkA protein were present
in membranes isolated from X. laevis oocytes (Figure 3C), indi-
cating that differences in TrkA protein levels was unlikely to
account for the reduced TRPV1 sensitization. We next varied
NGF concentration (1–1,000 ng/mL) but kept the superfusion
time constant (5 min). TrkA is a high-affinity NGF receptor with
a dissociation constant Kd of less than 10�9 M (Kaplan et al.,
1991; Klein et al., 1991). When oocytes were stimulated with
1,000 ng/mL NGF, activation of the naked mole-rat TrkA recep-
tor produced a degree of sensitization similar to that observed
with rat TrkA (Figure 3C). These results strongly suggest that
the naked mole-rat TrkA molecule is less efficient at initiating
sensitization with NGF concentrations of �100 ng/mL, which
was shown to be saturating in adult rat sensory neurons (Shu
and Mendell, 1999). It is conceivable that recombinant human
NGF used in this study (rhNGF) displays stronger binding affinity
to rat TrkA than to the naked-mole-rat TrkA. To test this idea, we
cloned chimeric TrkA receptors containing the N-terminal, extra-
cellular part of the receptor from rat TrkA together with the trans-
membrane domain and entire intracellular kinase domain from
the naked mole-rat molecule (Figures 3D and 3E). HEK293 cells
were transiently transfected with either rat or chimeric TrkA
construct to assess NGF-stimulated TrkA activation (Figure S4).
An antibody raised against extracellular rat TrkA domain was
used to measure the total level of TrkA protein in cell lysates (total
TrkA), and two antibodies that recognize phosphorylated tyro-
sine residues in the TrkA kinase domain were employed to study
receptor activation. Anti-phospho-TrkA (Tyr674/675; numbering
for human TrkA) was used to measure the phosphorylation levels
of the activation loop tyrosines (Segal and Greenberg, 1996; Se-
gal et al., 1996), and an anti-phospho-TrkA (Tyr490) was used
that recognizes the activated putative Shc binding site (Oberme-
ier et al., 1993a). NGF stimulation triggered rapid phosphoryla-
tion of Tyr674/675 in rat TrkA, but not in chimeric TrkA (Figures
S4A and S4B). In contrast to rat TrkA, NGF treatment did not
have any effect on activation of Tyr674/675 in the chimeric
TrkA receptor. However, the Tyr674/675 residues in both
chimeric TrkA and rat TrkA displayed strong basal receptor
phosphorylation in the absence of NGF, probably triggered by
receptor dimerization events due to overexpression. This obser-
vation is in agreement with previous findings that an antibody
against the TrkA extracellular domain can itself crosslink two re-
ceptors, causing their activation in PC12 cells (Clary et al., 1994;
Hempstead et al., 1992). NGF triggered increased phosphoryla-
tion of the Tyr490 residue in the rat TrkA molecule after 1 min but
did not have any apparent effect on the phosphorylation level
of the chimeric TrkA Tyr490 residue (Figures S4C and S4D).
Next, we tested chimeric TrkA in the context of NGF-mediated
TRPV1 sensitization. Proton acid-gated TRPV1 currents in
X. laevis oocytes co-expressing chimeric TrkA could only be

751
 moderately sensitized with 100 ng/mL NGF; indeed, the mean
level of sensitization observed was not significantly larger than
that found with the full-length nmrTrkA (Figure 3E). In contrast,
sensitization of TRPV1 proton currents by NGF-stimulated oo-
cytes co-expressing ratTrkA was at least twice as large as with
full-length nmrTrkA or chimeric receptors. These results strongly
suggest that a hypo-functional naked mole-rat TrkA kinase
domain underlies the lack of TRPV1 sensitization in this species.
Quantitative Proteomics Reveals Hypofunctional
Downstream Signaling of the nmrTrkA Intracellular
Domain
A quantitative proteomics approach was used that combined
HEK293 cell stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture
(SILAC) (Ong et al., 2002) with high-resolution liquid chromatog-
raphy coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
Heavy-stable isotope (Lys-8 and Arg-10)-labeled HEK cells tran-
siently expressing rat or chimeric TrkA were stimulated with
murine NGF (100 ng/mL) for 10 min and light-stable isotope
(Lys-0 and Arg-0) cells were left untreated (Figure 4A) (Olsen
et al., 2006). Following stimulation, cells were lysed, and equal
amounts of protein were used for each SILAC pair (Figure 4A).
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) chromatography was used for phospho-
peptide enrichment, and peptides were analyzed with LC-MS/
MS. Typically, phosphopeptides were sequenced several times
in different forms (such as oxidized methionine or missed tryptic
cleavage), and overall, a similar number of phosphopeptide sites
were quantified and identified in cells transfected with rat TrkA or
chimeric TrkA (Figure 4B), indicating a similar overall number of
phosphorylated proteins in each condition. Class I phosphopep-
tide sites comprise those residues with the highest localization
probability for the phospho-group (>0.75); that is, the sum of
probabilities of other potential sites is less than 0.25. From
more than 2,000 identified and quantified class I phospho-sites,

Figure 3. Naked Mole-Rat TrkA Is Impaired in TRPV1 Current Potentiation
(A) Schematic representation of the transfection and recording conditions used.
(B) NGF causes substantial sensitization of proton-gated rat TRPV1 currents when signaling through rat TrkA, but this effect is reduced in the oocytes co-ex-
pressing the naked mole-rat TrkA receptor.
(C) Sensitization levels across NGF concentrations were calculated as the ratio of a current immediately after and before NGF superfusion. High NGF con-
centration rescues the sensitization through NGF TrkA. For all the measurements, at least three pH stimuli were applied before the NGF superfusion in order to
obtain the stable current responses, while at least two acid-gated currents were recorded post-NGF application. Between 2 and 18 oocytes were recorded for
every NGF concentration. Inset: ten oocytes, injected with equal concentration of rat or naked mole-ratTrkA cRNA, were lysed, and pelleted membranes were
subjected to western blotting. Prior to blotting, the protein concentration was measured to ensure equal sample loading. TrkA is expressed as a 140-kDa protein.
(D and E) 100 ng/mL NGF potentiated acid-gated TRPV1 currents recorded in X. laevis oocytes via chimeric TrkA (D), but the sensitization level was significantly
smaller than for rat TrkA and not different from the NMR TrkA receptor quantified in (E).
Two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparison was used in (C), and one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test was used in (E) (*p < 0.05;
***p < 0.001). Data are presented as mean ± SEM, except in (C) for NMR TrkA at 1 ng/mL NGF (only mean current plotted), where two oocytes were recorded.

 the distribution of phosphoserine (pSer), phosphothreonine
(pThr), and phosphotyrosine (pTyr) sites observed in cells trans-
fected with rat or chimeric TrkA was similar to distributions re-
ported previously with cells stimulated with NGF or epidermal
growth factor (EGF) (Emdal et al., 2015; Olsen et al., 2006). We
next examined the NGF-upregulated phospho-sites and found
that significantly more phosphopeptides were upregulated in
NGF-treated cells with rat TrkA (361/2,239 [16.8%]) compared
to cells with chimeric TrkA (270/2,007 [13.5%]; Figure 4B).
Analysis of upregulated phospho-site sequence motifs
was used to extract over-represented and enriched sequence
patterns (Chou and Schwartz, 2011; Schwartz and Gygi,
2005). NGF stimulation was associated with the upregulation
of a similar pattern of sequence motifs surrounding pSer res-
idues in cells with rat or chimeric TrkA (Figure S5). However,
stimulation of the rat TrkA receptor was associated with a
more substantial enrichment of proline-containing motifs
compared to chimeric TrkA, which is an indicator of stronger
activation of MAPK/CDK protein families (Amanchy et al.,
2007).
An additional quantitative proteomics experiment revealed
that there was a stronger activation of specific phosphopeptides
from Erk2 (MAPK1, pTyr-187) and Erk1 (MAPK3, pTyr-204) (Crit-
ton et al., 2008; Sacco et al., 2009) after stimulation of the cells
expressing rat TrkA compared to chimeric TrkA (Figure 4C). In
addition, western blotting for phosphorylated Erk in HEK293
cells transfected with rat or chimeric TrkA after NGF stimulation
revealed reduced levels of phospho-Erk protein after stimula-
tion of the chimeric receptor (Figure 4D). We could also iden-
tify and quantify the changes in phosphopeptides from p38-a
(MAPK14), a kinase involved in TRPV1 regulation in sensory neu-
rons (Ji et al., 2002; Raingeaud et al., 1995). We observed a
stronger increase in the abundance of p38-a derived-phospho-
peptides containing the pTyr182 residue after stimulation of rat
TrkA compared to chimeric TrkA (Figure 4E). A phosphoserine
residue on the same protein (pSer2) (Olsen et al., 2010) did not

(Figure 4E).
Developmental Consequences of Hypofunctional TrkA
in the Naked Mole-Rat
NGF-TrkA signaling is essential for the survival of embryonic sen-
sory neurons (Lallemend and Ernfors, 2012; Lewin and Barde,
1996). Adult naked mole-rats have a striking paucity of C-fibers
in cutaneous nerves (St John Smith et al., 2012), a feature that
is reminiscent of NGF/TrkA loss of function in humans and mice
(Crowley et al., 1994; Indo et al., 1996). We thus used transmis-
sion electron microscopy to quantify the numbers of myelinated
and unmyelinated fibers in peripheral nerves of postnatal day 3
(P3) naked mole-rats and mice (Figures 5A and 5B). We
compared the numbers of myelinated (or myelinating) axons in
the saphenous and common peroneal nerves in neonates with
the published values for adult mice and naked mole-rats using
identical methods. We found that the number of unmyelinated
C-fibers counted in cross-sections from the purely cutaneous
saphenous nerve and the mixed common peroneal nerve from
naked mole-rats was between 2- and 3.5-fold higher than the
number observed in adult nerves (Figure 5D). However, the num-
ber of unmyelinated fibers found in the mouse common peroneal
nerve did not change between P3 and adult mole-rats, although
there was a small attrition of C-fibers from the saphenous nerve
(Figure 5D). In contrast, although the peripheral nerves of P3
naked mole-rats and mice are still undergoing myelination
(Figures 5A and 5B), the number of fibers with a myelin sheath
(A-fibers) was not different between nerves from the neonate
and adult (Figure 5C). These data suggested that there is sub-
stantial loss of unmyelinated axons from cutaneous and mixed
peripheral nerves of naked mole-rats between P3 and adulthood.
DISCUSSION
We dissected the molecular mechanism that underlies the
absence of thermal hyperalgesia in the African naked mole-rat
(H. glaber) (Park et al., 2008). NGF is central player in the gener-
ation of thermal hyperalgesia and acts via its receptor TrkA to
initiate hyperalgesia in a TRPV1-dependent manner (Bonnington
and McNaughton, 2003; Chuang et al., 2001; Lewin et al., 2014).
We have shown that lack of heat hyperalgesia in the naked mole-
rat is associated with absence of NGF-induced TRPV1 sensitiza-
tion in sensory neurons. Our data indicate that the key molecular
change in the signal transduction pathway from NGF to hyperal-
gesia is a unique but minimal sequence change in the naked
mole-rat TrkA molecule. We provide evidence that between
one and three unique amino acid substitutions within the kinase
domain make the naked mole-rat TrkA receptor less efficient at
engaging downstream signal transduction, including members
of the MAPK family of effectors. Efficient NGF signaling is also
a prerequisite for the survival and terminal branching of embry-
onic sensory neurons in the mouse (Crowley et al., 1994; Patel
et al., 2000). Interestingly, a hypofunctional TrkA receptor in
the naked mole-rat is associated with a striking paucity of unmy-
elinated C-fibers in adult peripheral nerves (St John Smith et al.,
2012). A comparative anatomical study of six other African mole-
rat species (for which TrkA sequences were obtained here) indi-
cated that the C-fiber deficit appears to be unique to naked
mole-rats (St John Smith et al., 2012). Even though the Mashona
mole-rat (F. darlingi) shares two out of the three unique amino
acid variants found in TrkA kinase domain of the naked mole-
rat receptor (Figure S3B), it does not lack C-fibers (St John Smith
et al., 2012). We thus postulate that hypofunctional TrkA
signaling in vivo may lead to a loss of C-fibers in naked mole-
rats. However, newborn naked mole-rats were found to have

 many more C-fibers in peripheral nerves than adults. This finding
suggests that C-fibers in the naked mole-rat are lost between P3
and adulthood, perhaps as a consequence of hypofunctional
TrkA signaling.
Among vertebrate receptors, the TrkA receptor displays the
strictest conservation in the intracellular kinase domain (Fig-
ure S2). Using chimeric TrkA receptors (rat extracellular/naked
mole-rat intracellular), we could show directly that the reduced
ability of the naked mole-rat TrkA receptor to sensitize TRPV1
currents is likely localized to the kinase domain (Figure 3). Indeed,
biochemical experiments demonstrated a striking reduction
in signaling capacity in terms of ligand-dependent tyrosine phos-
phorylation (Figure S4); however, all the important tyrosine
residues in the kinase domain are conserved in the naked
mole-rat TrkA molecule (Figure S2). We speculate that insertion
of a cysteine for a leucine at position 774 in the naked mole-rat
TrkA receptor may alter the efficiency of phosphorylation or
recognition of the flanking tyrosine’s Tyr751 and Tyr785. Tyro-
sine 751 has been implicated in binding of the p85 subunit
of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (Obermeier et al., 1993b), and
Tyr785 serves as a major and selective interaction site for phos-
phoinositide phospholipase C-g (Obermeier et al., 1993a). It is
of course also possible that accumulated effects of the other
variants that are not specific to naked mole-rat TrkA (Fig-
ure S3B) contribute to the reduction in receptor signaling we
have observed.
Our data strongly suggest that molecular changes in naked
mole-rat TrkA molecule alter signal transduction efficiency.
Ligand concentration of 100 ng/mL produced almost maximal
sensitization of TRPV1 in our oocyte expression system, a similar
dose dependence to that found for capsaicin current sensitiza-
tion in rat sensory neurons (Shu and Mendell, 1999). In contrast,
NGF stimulation of chimeric TrkA receptor produced little sensi-
tization of TRPV1 currents at 100 ng/mL but normal sensitization
at 1,000 ng/mL (Figure 3C). The maintained efficacy of the naked
mole-rat TrkA receptor at very high NGF concentrations is
consistent with our previous observation that NGF (500 ng/mL)
promotes neurite outgrowth of both mouse and naked mole-
rat sensory neurons in culture (Park et al., 2008). However, it is
well known that orders-of-magnitude lower concentrations of
NGF (<1 ng/mL) are capable of promoting maximal neuronal
survival or neurite outgrowth in developing neurons (Davies
et al., 1993; Vaillant et al., 2002; Ye et al., 2003). Using a high-res-
olution quantitative proteomics approach, we found that 10 min
after NGF stimulation with 100 ng/mL, there were subtle but sig-
nificant differences in upregulated phosphopeptides between
rat TrkA and a chimeric TrkA containing the naked mole-rat
intracellular domain. We obtained evidence of reduced pTyr on
peptides belonging to MAPK proteins, including p38a, which
has been directly implicated in the sensitization of TRPV1 (Ji
et al., 2002).
Surprisingly, naked mole-rat pups do not show the deficit
in C-fibers that we had observed in adult animals (Figure 5).
It thus appears that the signaling capacity of the naked mole-
rat TrkA is sufficient to support the survival and functional devel-
opment of sensory neurons during embryonic development
(Crowley et al., 1994; Lechner et al., 2009). NGF is functionally
important for the maintenance of mature sensory neurons (Lewin
et al., 2014), but rodents exposed to NGF-function blocking an-
tibodies exhibit death of sympathetic neurons, but probably not
sensory neurons (Gorin and Johnson, 1980; Lewin et al., 1992;
Ruberti et al., 2000). The concentrations of NGF that robustly
sensitize TRPV1 in adult neurons are clearly much higher than
those needed to support embryonic survival (see above). It is
thus conceivable that the molecular changes in the naked
mole-rat TrkA receptor that we describe are more relevant to
physiological processes that follow strong receptor stimulation.
In this context it is interesting to note that NGF signaling in adult
naked mole-rat is still capable of producing mechanical hyperal-
gesia, a process that does not involve TRPV1 (Lewin et al., 2014).
It is possible that hypofunctional TrkA signaling leads to the loss
of sensory neurons in naked mole-rats after birth. Naked mole-
rats have an extraordinarily long gestation period of �70 days
and can live for up to 32 years (Jarvis, 1991; Sanchez et al.,
2015). It is thus feasible that developmental events that occur
just after birth, like the loss of TrkA expression in approximately
half of the nociceptors (Bennett et al., 1998; Molliver et al., 1997),
occur over a more protracted period in the naked mole-rat. In this
context, it is important to note that some nociceptors in rats and
mice are still dependent on NGF for survival for a few days after
birth (Crowley et al., 1994; Lewin et al., 1992). We find that the
paucity of C-fibers in cutaneous nerves is correlated with molec-
ular changes in the TrkA receptor associated with reduced
signaling (Figure S4). However, it is still possible that effects of
other as-yet-unknown gene variants in the naked mole-rat
potentiate the effects of the TrkA variants to promote postnatal
nociceptor loss.
In summary, we provide evidence that evolution has selected
for a single-molecule change in the naked mole-rat NGF receptor
TrkA that is sufficient to abolish heat hyperalgesia in this species.
Mutations in the trkA gene are highly detrimental in humans,
but here we show that evolution has selected for sequence
change(s) in the naked mole-rat gene that are not only function-
ally powerful but also compatible with species survival and
continued fitness. We speculate that heat hyperalgesia is not
an essential phenotypic attribute for the naked mole-rat that is
adapted to a subterranean habitat in equatorial East Africa,
where temperatures have remained constant for millions of
years. Other African mole-rat species have apparently not
dispensed with efficient TrkA signaling, and we speculate that
one reason for this is that the naked mole-rat is probably the
most energetically challenged species in this family (Bennett
and Faulkes, 2000). Thus, naked mole-rats can make do with
a stripped-down nociceptive system, equipped with fewer C-fi-
bers, that requires less energy but is sufficient for acute nocicep-
tion and mechanical hyperalgesia following injury (Park et al.,
2008). Our study illustrates how evolution can select for mecha-
nistically novel single-molecule changes that exert dramatic
phenotypic effects but are compatible with the maintenance of
species fitness.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
DRG Neuron and Cell Culture
Animal housing, care, and protocols for euthanasia were approved by German
federal authorities (State of Berlin). Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons were

 prepared from both naked mole-rat and mouse as described previously (Park
et al., 2008) and plated onto glass coverslips plated with poly-L-lysine (PLL;
200 mg/mL) and laminin (20 mg/mL). CHO and naked mole-rat fibroblast cells
were cultured in F12-Ham medium (Life Technologies) and incubated at 37�C
in 5% CO2. For electrophysiology experiments, cells were plated onto PLL-
coated plastic dishes and the following day transfected with Lipofectamine
(Invitrogen).
Electrophysiology
Recordings from DRG neurons took place after a 10- to 20-min incubation with
either IB4-Alexa 488 or IB4-Alexa Fluor 568 (Invitrogen). Whole-cell recordings
were made using pipettes (3–6 MU resistance) pulled with a Flaming-Brown
puller (Sutter Instruments). Extracellular solution contained 140 mM NaCl,
1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2, 4 mM KCl, 4 mM glucose, and 10 mM HEPES
(pH 7.4) with NaOH. Electrodes were filled with 110 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl,
1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.3). Solutions were applied
and heated using a gravity-driven multi-barrel perfusion system (WAS-02)
(Dittert et al., 2006).
X. laevis defoliculated oocytes (stage V or VI) were purchased from EcoCyte
Bioscience. Each oocyte was injected in Barth solution using the Nanoject II
Auto-Nanoliter Injector (Drummond) with 32.2 nL cRNA mix. Two-electrode
voltage-clamp recordings were performed at room temperature 3–5 days after
injection using a GeneClamp500B Amplifier, Digidata 1322A, and pClamp 8.0
Software (Axon Instruments). Additional details are available in Supplemental
Experimental Procedures.
Molecular Biology and RNA Sequencing
Cloning of naked mole-rat Trpv1 was described before (Smith et al., 2011).
In order to clone naked mole-rat TrkA, total RNA was isolated from DRGs
with TRIzol (Life Technologies) and dissolved in 30 mL RNase-free water.
1–3 mg total RNA and oligo(dT) and random hexamers (BioTeZ) were
used for cDNA synthesis using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Life
Technologies).
To sequence the coding DNA sequence (CDS) for the TrkA intracellular ki-
nase domain of other African mole-rat species, primers specific for NMR
TrkA were used to amplify exons 12–17 from species’ genomic DNA. Five
mole-rats representative of the Bathyergidae family were used: Giant
(F. mechowii), Damaraland (Fukomys damarensis), Mashona (Fukomys dar-
lingi), Natal (Cryptomys hottentotus natalensis), and Emin’s (Heliophobius
emini) mole-rats. RNA-seq data for F. darlingi were generated from three brain
samples
using
paired-end,
strand-specific
(dUTP)
libraries
that
were
sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2000 platform. The accession number for
the annotated transcriptome and the sequencing reads from the Mashona
mole-rat reported in this paper is NCBI: PRJNA303968. Additional details
are available in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Immunocytochemistry and Calcium Imaging
Standard immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry protocols on
NMR and mouse DRGs were used using an anti-TrkA antibody (kind gift
from L.F. Reichardt, UCSF) and IB4-488. Immunofluorescent images were
examined with a Leica DM 5000B microscope and MetaVue software
(Visitron).
Calcium imaging was conducted as described previously (Milenkovic et al.,
2007). Standard Fura-2 ratiometric calcium imaging was conducted to mea-
sure responses to capsaicin in CHO and naked mole-rat fibroblast cells trans-
fected with rat TRPV1and NMR TRPV1, respectively, with or without rTrkA. An
inverted microscope (Zeiss Observer A1) equipped with the MetaFluor pho-
tonics imaging system, including Polychromator V or DG4 (Sutter Instruments),
and a CoolSNAP ES camera (Visitron) was used for cell imaging. Additional
details are available in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
MS-Based Protein Quantification Using SILAC
SILAC-labeled HEK293 cells were transfected with TrkA constructs (rat or
chimeric) and pEGFP plasmid (5:1) with polyethylenimine. 24 hr after transfec-
tion, cells were serum starved and stimulated for 10 min with 100 ng/mL NGF
(murine 2.5S, Promega) or left untreated. Equal amounts of protein from each
SILAC pair were mixed together. Protein mixtures were reduced with DTT, al-
kylated with iodoacetamide, pre-digested with Lysyl endopeptidase (LysC,
Wako), and subjected to trypsin digestion overnight. Peptides were purified
from stop-and-go extraction (STAGE) tips. Phosphopeptide enrichment was
performed on 0.5 mg TiO2 beads. Phosphopeptides were separated on a
monolithic column (100 mm inner diameter 3 2,000 mm, MonoCap C18 High
Resolution 2000 [GL Sciences]; kindly provided by Dr. Yasushi Ishihama
[Kyoto University]). The Q Exactive instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was
operated in the data-dependent mode, and MaxQuant software was used to
identify and quantify proteins. MS/MS spectra were searched using the
Andromeda search engine. Additional details are available in Supplemental
Experimental Procedures.
