In 2016, a total of 18 human infections with influenza 
A(H3N2) virus occurred after exposure to influenza-infected 
swine at 7 agricultural fairs. Sixteen of these cases were 
the result of infection by a reassorted virus with increasing 
prevalence among US swine containing a hemagglutinin 
gene from 2010–11 human seasonal H3N2 strains.
I
nfluenza A virus infects many animal species. Zoonotic 
transmission allows for the introduction of novel in-
fluenza A virus strains to the human population, which 
has the potential to cause the next influenza pandemic. 
Swine exhibitions at agricultural fairs have emerged as a 
source for amplification of swine-lineage influenza A vi-
rus; these unique swine–human interfaces have generated 
most human infections with variant influenza A virus in 
the United States (1). 
During July–August 2016, outbreaks of variant H3N2 
virus (H3N2v) were reported in Ohio and Michigan, and 
18 zoonotic influenza A virus infections were detected 
(2). All persons identified with H3N2v infections during 
these outbreaks reported swine exposure while attending 
>1 of 7 fairs in Ohio or Michigan. We examined the role of 
 
exhibition swine in the transmission of this reassortant 
influenza A virus, which contained a hemagglutinin gene 
from 2010–11 human seasonal H3N2 strains.
The Study
Active influenza A virus surveillance among exhibition 
swine occurred during summer 2016 at 101 agricultural 
fairs across the midwestern United States; pigs were 
sampled at the end of exhibition irrespective of clini-
cal signs of respiratory disease (3). Samples obtained 
using nasal swabs or nasal wipes were stored in viral 
transport medium at –80°C (4,5). Upon notification from 
the state animal health official, samples collected from 
pigs at fairs associated with H3N2v cases were screened 
for influenza A virus with real-time reverse transcrip-
tion PCR, and positive samples were inoculated for virus 
isolation as previously described (6). The genomes of 1 
or 2 isolates per fair were sequenced, and the nucleotide 
sequences were deposited into GenBank (7). Nucleotide 
sequences of the H3N2v viruses detected in humans were 
deposited in the GISAID database (online Technical 
Appendix, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/23/9/17-
0847-Techapp.pdf). 
We used MAFFT version 7.222 (8) to align sequences 
and manually corrected them in MEGA7 (9). We inferred 
maximum-likelihood trees by using IQ-TREE version 1.4.3 
under a general time reversible plus gamma distribution 
plus invariant sites evolutionary model (10), and assessed 
branch support using an ultrafast bootstrap approximation 
with 1,000 replicates (11). We visualized and annotated 
trees using MEGA7.
We found that 7 fairs in Ohio (n = 4) and Michigan 
(n = 3) were associated with human H3N2v cases during 
July–August 2016. Of those, 6 (fairs A–F) were participat-
ing in the active influenza A virus swine surveillance pro-
gram. We also included a diagnostic lab submission for a 
pig with respiratory disease at the seventh fair (fair G) in 
this study.
We sampled 161 pigs across the 7 fairs, and isolat-
ed H3N2 virus from >1 pig at each fair. Virus isolation 
data from fairs A–F (Table 1) indicated that the average 
prevalence of influenza A–infected swine in these fairs 
was 77.5% (individual fair range 60%–90%), indicating 
extensive influenza A virus amplification within the swine 
at each of these fairs. However, widespread influenza-like

illness among swine was reported at only 2 of the fairs 
(fairs A and E), suggesting that subclinical influenza A in-
fections in pigs remain a threat to public health (3).
A fair-by-fair comparison of the influenza A virus ge-
nomes sequenced from human H3N2v cases and isolates 
from swine provided strong molecular evidence of zoo-
notic influenza A virus transmission. The viruses recovered 
from swine were nearly identical to viruses identified in 
humans, and human virus gene segment sequences were 
nested within monophyletic swine virus clades. We identi-
fied 2 distinct H3 lineages in the pigs and humans across 
the implicated fairs (Figure 1). An influenza A virus from 
the well-established H3 cluster IV-A, found in the pigs at 
fair C, was responsible for 2 (11.1%) human cases. This 
cluster IV-A H3N2 genome belonged to the previously 
described H3 genotype 1 (Table 2) and was similar to the 
viruses responsible for the H3N2v infections detected in 
2011–2013 (12). The influenza A virus detected in swine at 
the 6 fairs associated with the remaining 16 (88.9%) human 
H3N2v cases was a relatively new H3 lineage in swine. 
The HA gene of this virus descended from the human sea-
sonal H3N2 virus circulating in 2010–11, which has since 
reassorted with enzootic swine influenza A viruses to pro-
duce novel viruses in the US swine herd (13). The other 7 
gene segments in this human-like H3 reassortant virus were 
of the same lineages as those segments found in the cluster 
IV-A virus (Table 2).
Irrespective of the fair of origin, the genomic sequenc-
es of all 11 human-like H3N2 virus isolates from swine 
were >99.89% identical to each other, demonstrating clonal 
expansion of 1 virus across 2 states. This pattern of virus 
dissemination within the exhibition swine population was a 
hallmark of the 2012 fair season, when 306 H3N2v human 
cases were reported (6).
Influenza A virus was detected in pigs at each fair at 
least 1 day before each H3N2v virus infection was detect-
ed in humans (Figure 2). The observed lag time between 
the collection of human and swine samples is probably 
a function of the timing for active surveillance in swine 
(i.e., swine are sampled at the end of the fair), whereas 
specimens were collected from humans when they showed 
symptoms of influenza-like illness (Figure 2). Retrospec-
tive investigations of infections in the swine from these 
fairs would not have been possible if the pig sampling re-
lied on protocols triggered by the detection of H3N2v virus 
cases in humans because fairs typically run for 1 week and 
infected swine would have been dispersed before sampling 
could have occurred.
Conclusions
Variant influenza infections in humans continue to occur 
through contact with exhibition swine; often, the cases are 
in swine exhibitors with close and prolonged swine ex-
posure. The concurrent detection of genetically identical 
influenza A viruses from exhibition swine across 2 states 
illustrates the rapidity with which this virus, and potentially 
other pathogens, can move within the highly mobile exhi-
bition swine population. In addition to the zoonotic risks 
of influenza A virus, this pattern serves as a warning of 
possible dissemination of other emerging or high-conse-
quence diseases in swine. Management practices common 
in the exhibition swine industry (i.e., frequent exhibition 
and relaxed biosecurity) facilitate the rapid dissemination 
of influenza virus across a large geographic landscape 
(14). Collaboration between animal and public health of-
ficials facilitated this investigation. Methods to control 
intraspecies and interspecies influenza virus transmission 
during swine shows have been outlined by the National 
 
Association 
of 
State 
Public 
Health 
Veterinarians 
 
(http://nasphv.org/Documents/Influenza_Transmission_
at_Swine_Exhibitions_2016.pdf).
The recovery of human-like H3 influenza A vi-
ruses from exhibition swine supports previous studies 
demonstrating that the US commercial swine herd can 
serve as an influenza A reservoir for the much smaller 
exhibition swine population, which is more accessible 
to humans. Within the US commercial herd, the propor-
tion of H3 isolates containing human-like H3 nearly 
doubled to 46% in spring and summer 2016 (data not 
shown). Whereas human-like H3s have been circulat-
ing, reassorting, and becoming more prevalent in the 
commercial swine population since 2012, introduction 
and expansion of the human-like H3 reassortant influ-
enza A viruses in exhibition swine facilitated docu-
mented zoonoses from this genotype. The path tra-
versed by this human-like H3, from initial introduction 
from humans to swine until the zoonotic transmission 
 
events of 2016, demonstrates how novel viruses can be 
generated and maintained in animal populations and, 
subsequently, can infect humans through specific eco-
logic niches like swine exhibitions or live-animal mar-
kets (15). Therefore, continued surveillance in swine 
populations is imperative for detecting novel influenza 
A viruses that threaten swine and human health.
