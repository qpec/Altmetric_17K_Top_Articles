Abstract
Because ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder and patients typically display symptoms before 
the age of three1, one of the key questions in autism research is whether the pathology is reversible 
in adults. Here we investigated the developmental requirement of Shank3, one of the most 
prominent monogenic ASD genes that is estimated to contribute to ~1% of all ASD cases2–6. 
SHANK3 is a postsynaptic scaffold protein that regulates synaptic development, function and 
plasticity by orchestrating the assembly of postsynaptic density (PSD) macromolecular signaling 
complex7–9. Disruptions of the Shank3 gene in mouse models have resulted in synaptic defects 
and autistic-like behaviors including anxiety, social interaction deficits, and repetitive 
behavior10–13. We generated a novel Shank3 conditional knock-in mouse model and used it to 
demonstrate that re-expression of the Shank3 gene in adult led to improvements in synaptic 
protein composition, spine density and neural function in the striatum. We also provided 
behavioral evidence that certain behavioral abnormalities including social interaction deficit and 
repetitive grooming behavior could be rescued, while anxiety and motor coordination deficit could 
not be recovered in adulthood. Together, these results elucidate the profound impact of post-

 developmental activation of Shank3 expression on neural function and demonstrate certain degree 
of continued plasticity in the adult diseased brain.
The SHANK3 (ProSAP2) protein is a major scaffolding protein at the excitatory synapse, 
coordinating the recruitment of many postsynaptic signaling molecules14–15. Previous work 
shows that Shank3 germline deletion in mice disrupts the protein composition at the 
postsynaptic density (PSD), reduces neurotransmission efficiency and leads to autistic-like 
behavior10–13.
To address whether adult reversal of physiological and behavioral abnormalities in Shank3 
mutant mice is possible, we adopted a genetic method that allows for inducible Shank3 
expression. Because Shank3 duplication is linked to ADHD and bipolar disorder5,6,16, it is 
critical to keep Shank3 expression within its physiological concentrations to avoid potential 
confounds. Thus, we generated a novel Shank3 conditional knock-in mouse by using the 
Cre-dependent genetic switch (FLEx) strategy17, which enables the conditional 
manipulation of the Shank3 gene at its endogenous genomic locus.
We genetically targeted the PDZ domain due to its role in assembling the scaffold complex 
in the PSD14–15 (Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig. 1). In the absence of Cre, the Shank3fx/fx mice 
function as Shank3 knockout (KO), and result in the deletion of most major isoforms of 
SHANK3 including the putative alpha, beta, and gamma bands (Fig. 1b). Similar to 
abnormalities previously reported on Shank3 KO mice10–13, these Shank3fx/fx mice showed 
significant deficits in exploratory behavior (Fig. 1c), anxiety (Fig. 1e), motor deficits (Fig. 
1d), and displayed open wound lesions which suggest repetitive grooming behavior12,18. In 
addition, they showed impaired neurotransmission in the dorsal striatum (Fig. 1f–g). These 
novel Shank3fx/fx mice thus recapitulate autistic-like phenotypes, enabling us to investigate 
the possibility of reversing those deficits in adulthood.
To achieve temporal control of Shank3 expression, we crossed the Shank3fx/fx mice to an 
inducible CAGGS-CreER mouse line19 that activates global Cre function upon tamoxifen 
treatment (Extended Data Fig. 1d, e). When the Shank3fx/fx:CreER+/− mice reached 2–4.5 
months, we used oral gavage to deliver tamoxifen to ensure efficient Cre-mediated gene 
restoration (Fig. 2a). All experiments were performed on the following three groups: 
Shank3+/+:CreER+/− treated with tamoxifen (WT), Shank3fx/fx:CreER+/− treated with 
tamoxifen (TM), and Shank3fx/fx:CreER+/− treated with corn oil vehicle (KO). 
Synaptosomal preparations showed that tamoxifen treatment restored the expression of most 
major SHANK3 isoforms including the alpha and beta isoforms to the wildtype level at 
synapses (Fig. 2b).
Because SHANK3 is the only SHANK protein family member highly enriched in the 
striatum, a region strongly implicated in certain behaviors associated with autism12, 18, 
mechanistic characterizations were primarily carried out on striatal neurons. We found that 
the synaptic concentrations of scaffold proteins SAPAP3, Homer1b/c and glutamate receptor 
subunits NR2A, NR2B and GluA2 were significantly reduced in KO striatal synaptosomal 
preparations. However, in the TM condition, the synaptic levels of these postsynaptic 
proteins were significantly increased compared to those in the KO, reaching comparable

 levels of the WT(Fig. 2c). This molecular alteration shows for the first time that restoring 
Shank3 expression in the adult brain can efficiently recruit major scaffolding and signaling 
proteins to the synapse and assemble the PSD protein network even after the developmental 
period.
To investigate whether there were functional changes parallel to molecular repair at 
synapses, we examined striatal physiology. As expected, the KO showed significantly 
reduced field population spikes. However, the reduced field responses were rescued to WT 
levels in the TM condition (Fig. 2d–e). We then performed whole-cell recordings and found 
that KO mice had reduced mEPSC frequency compared to WT mice. Interestingly, mEPSC 
frequency was rescued in TM to comparable level of WT group (Fig. 2f). We further 
measured paired pulse ratio (PPR), AMPAR/NMDAR ratio (Extended Data Fig. 2 and 3), 
and NR2B/total NMDAR ratio (Extended Data Fig. 2c). We found no differences across 
genotypes. Overall, these results suggest that a primary defect of striatal physiology in KO 
mice is the reduced mEPSC frequency, and this defect can be improved by restoring Shank3 
expression in adulthood.
Previous studies have shown that Shank3 manipulation can lead to significant changes in the 
total spine density6,12. It is, however, unclear whether post-developmental Shank3 
expression can also affect spine structure. To address this, we used systemic viral injection 
to sparsely label neurons with GFP in the WT, KO, and TM mice and analyzed their 
dendritic spines in the dorsal striatum. Similar to our previous report on Shank3B KO 
mice12, we observed a significant reduction of MSN spine density in the KO compared to 
the WT. Surprisingly, the total spine density was significantly increased in the TM treated 
mice compared to the KO mice (Fig. 2g). To our knowledge, this is the first indication that 
the ability of Shank3 to promote spine formation or maintenance is not restricted to any 
developmental critical period, highlighting the continued structural plasticity in the adult 
striatum. Interestingly, the spine density in the TM condition is significantly higher than that 
of the WT. One possibility for this phenomenon is that adult Shank3 expression induces 
dendritic spines that may not be pruned and regulated by the same processes that occur in 
development.
We next tested how adult Shank3 expression may affect behavioral abnormalities. Since 
striatal defects have been strongly linked to repetitive/compulsive behaviors21 and Shank3 
KO mice show overgrooming12, we videotaped WT, TM, and KO mice after treatment, and 
quantified their grooming time. The results indicated that while there was a significant 
increase in the percentage of time spent grooming in the KO mice compared to WT mice, 
TM mice exhibited significantly reduced grooming time (Fig. 3a, b). In addition, during the 
tamoxifen treatment, we noticed that some Shank3fx/fx:CreER+/− mice that initially 
developed lesions began to heal and regrow their lost fur, providing further support that 
repetitive/excessive grooming phenotype is reversible in the Shank3fx/fx mice.
One of the defining features of autism is the impairment in social interaction. Thus, we used 
a modified three-chamber assay to probe voluntary social interaction12,13,22. After 
habituating to the three-chamber box, the test mice were given a choice of either interacting 
with a novel object or a stranger mouse. We found that while WT mice demonstrated strong

 preference for the stranger mouse over the novel object, KO mice displayed no such 
preference (Fig. 3c, d). Interestingly, we found that TM mice behaved similarly to their WT 
controls in that they show strong preference for the stranger mouse in both duration and 
frequency of interaction (Fig. 3c, d). These data show that, similar to repetitive grooming 
behavior, social interaction deficit can also be rescued in adulthood. Currently, the 
neurobiological mechanisms of social deficits of ASD are not well understood. Although 
ventral striatum has been associated with social interaction23, we did not observe differences 
in measurements of mEPSCs, AMPAR/NMDAR ratio, and PPR in the ventral striatum/
nucleus accumbens across genotypes (Extended Data Fig. 4).
Encouraged by the rescue of repetitive grooming and social deficits, we ran a battery of 
other tests to assess the extent of behavioral rescue. In contrast to the social and grooming 
behaviors, adult Shank3 re-expression has minimal impact on reduced locomotion, anxiety-
like behavior and motor coordination deficits (Fig. 4). In the open field, TM mice showed no 
significant difference from the KO mice in exploratory behavior (Fig. 4a) and anxiety-like 
behavior including rearing time and rearing frequency (Fig. 4b). This result was further 
corroborated by our observations from the elevated zero maze test (Fig. 4c). In addition, we 
found no significant recovery in motor coordination deficit (Fig. 4d).
Because the cortex and cerebellum have been linked to anxiety and motor coordination, we 
assessed the mechanistic changes in these brain regions24–25. In both regions, SHANK3 
expression was restored to WT level in TM mice (Extended Data Fig. 5 and 6). However, we 
found minimal differences across the genotypes (Extended Data Fig. 5–7). Thus, the circuit 
mechanisms of anxiety and motor coordination deficits in the Shank3 KO mice may involve 
other brain regions or could be the collective consequence of connectivity deficits across 
many brain regions.
To address whether the lack of rescue in these behavior phenotypes is indeed due to missing 
SHANK3 expression during development, we crossed Shank3fx/fx mice to β-actin-Cre mice, 
enabling germline restoration of Shank3. The germline rescue (GR) mice showed no 
significant differences in striatal physiology (Extended Data Fig. 4 and 8), exploratory 
behavior (Fig. 4e), anxiety (Fig. 4f, g), and motor coordination (Fig. 4h) from their wildtype 
littermates, indicating that restoring Shank3 expression at the germ cell stage can restore all 
behavioral phenotypes. Together, these data strongly suggest that there are certain 
developmental defects that are irreversible by adult re-expression of Shank3.
To test whether there is a developmental window for rescuing anxiety and motor deficits, we 
treated P20–21 mice with tamoxifen to efficiently induce Shank3 expression (Extended Data 
Fig. 9a), and assayed their behaviors in adulthood (Extended Data Fig. 9 and 10). As 
previously reported26, we observed that treatment of young mice with tamoxifen leads to 
some toxicity including reduced body weights in the WT mice and affected their motor 
coordination compared to the KO fed with corn oil (Extended Data Fig. 10d). However, even 
with the TM toxicity, we found that on the rotarod, the developmentally treated TM mice 
performed significantly better than their KO counterparts (Extended Data Fig. 10a, b). The 
P20–21 treated TM mice also showed significantly reduced anxiety on the elevated zero 
maze compared to the KO mice (Extended Data Fig. 9f). Overall, these behavioral results

 showed that earlier intervention yields more behavioral improvement than adult treatment, 
further supporting the developmental origin of the behavioral abnormalities that are 
irreversible in adults.
In the current study, we showed for the first time that in the adult mouse brain, Shank3 
expression can increase dendritic spine density, restore the PSD protein composition, and 
improve striatal neurotransmission. Though adult gene rescue characterizations have been 
performed on other autism genes27–28, this is the first report to show selective rescue in 
specifically autism-related behavioral phenotypes. Importantly, we also demonstrated that 
the behavioral deficits that are irreversible in the adult can be improved with early postnatal 
intervention. Our results highlight the unique behavioral impact of Shank3 expression after 
development, and underscore the surprising extent of continued neural plasticity in the adult 
brain.
 Full Methods
 Generation of Shank3CKI
The Shank3fx/fx targeting vector was designed by inverting the PDZ domain (exons 13 to 16) 
and flanking it with the FLEx cassette, which is composed of one pair of LoxP sites 
staggered with one pair of Lox2722 sites. Shank3fx/fx conditional knock-in mice were 
generated by homologous recombination in R1 embryonic stem cells and implanting the 
correctly targeted cells in C57 blastocysts using standard procedures. Correct locus insertion 
of the targeting construct into the genomic DNA was determined by PCR genotyping using 
two primers End_F (5′-GGCAGACTCCACACAGTTCCTG-3′) and LoxR (5′-
GTATCCTATACGAAGTTATTCCGGGTCGAC-3′). Subsequent mouse genotyping was 
determined by PCR of mouse tail or ear DNA using three primers. For the wildtype (WT) 
allele, primer FuncF2 (5′-CGTTTGACACACATAAGCACC-3′) and primer FuncFlipR4 (5′-
CTCCACCTAGCTGAATTTCCC-3′) were used to produce a band of 340 bp. For the 
knockout (Fx) allele, primer FuncF2 (5′-CGTTTGACACACATAAGCACC-3′) and primer 
Gen_Flx_R1 (5′-GCTGACATCACATTGCTGCC-3′) were used to produce a band of 481 
bp. For the rescue allele, primer FuncF2 (5′-CGTTTGACACACATAAGCACC-3′) and 
primer FuncFlipR4 (5′-CTCCACCTAGCTGAATTTCCC-3′) were used to produce a band 
of 408 bp.
Chimeric males were crossed to C57BL/6J females from Jackson Labs. The F1 hybrids were 
crossed with C57BL/6J β-Actin Flp to remove the Neomycin cassette. All progeny were 
bred onto the pure C57BL/6J (Jackson Labs) for at least two generations before being bred 
onto a mixed background with 129S1/SvlmJ (Jackson Labs). Heterozygotes were initially 
bred with heterozygotes to produce experimental animals. All germline Shank3fx/fx (KO) 
and germline rescue (GR) mice along with their respective wildtype littermates were 
produced by breeding heterozygotes with heterozygotes. For the adult Shank3 rescue 
experiments, the Shank3 conditional knock-in line was crossed with CAGGS-CreER19. In 
order to produce enough animals for all necessary experiments, breeding strategy was 
switched to heterozygotes crossed with homozygotes and homozygotes crossed with 
homozygotes for all conditions (Shank3fx/+:CreER+/− bred with Shank3fx/fx:CreER−/−; 
Shank3fx/fx:CreER+/− bred with Shank3fx/fx:CreER−/−; Shank3+/+:CreER+/− bred with

 Shank3+/+:CreER−/−; Shank3+/−:CreER+/− bred with Shank3+/+:CreER−/−). It should be 
noted that all animals in the rescue condition were produced from the same litters as the 
animals in the knockout condition. The animals were randomly assigned to different 
conditions. No computerized randomization program was used.
Animals were housed by genotype at a constant 23°C in a 12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 
07:00, lights dark at 19:00) with ad libitum food and water. Rescue treatment i.e. tamoxifen 
feeding was initiated on mice at 2–4.5 months. All electrophysiological and behavioral 
experiments were done at least 6 weeks after treatment in adult mice with the experimenter 
being blinded to the genotypes. Only age-matched male mice were used for behavioral 
assays. All experimental procedures were inspected and approved by the MIT Committee on 
Animal Care.
 Open Field
An automated Omnitech Digiscan apparatus (AccuScan Instruments) was used to assess 
spontaneous locomotion as previously described21. Anxiety-like behaviors were assessed by 
the following parameters: time spent rearing and frequency of rearing. Locomotion was 
evaluated by the total distance traveled. The first 30 minutes were evaluated for all 
parameters. Statistical analysis was done using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni multiple 
comparison tests.
 Zero Maze
An elevated zero maze was illuminated such that the open arm was lit by 60 lux, and the 
dark arm was lit by 10–20 lux. Animals were habituated with 10–20 lux for at least one hour 
before test. The animal was introduced into the closed arm and allowed to freely explore the 
maze for 5 minutes, which was videotaped. An observer blinded to the genotype performed 
analysis using an automated tracking software Noldus Ethovision. Anxiety-like behavior 
was assessed by the percentage of time spent by the animal in the open arm during the 5-min 
interval. Statistical analysis was done using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni multiple 
comparison tests.
 Rotarod
Animals were placed on a rotarod apparatus (Med Associates) that accelerates 4–40 rpm for 
5 minutes. Each animal was tested for three trials with 1–2 hours between trials in a single 
day. All trials were videotaped. Latency to fall was manually analyzed for each trial on 
Noldus Observer by an observer blinded to genotypes. The change in the latency to fall over 
the course of three trails indicates the quality of motor coordination. Statistical analysis was 
done using two-way repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc tests.
 Grooming
Animals were individually placed into a new cage and allowed to habituate. Grooming 
behavior was videotaped for 2 hours from 19:00 to 21:00 with red light (2 lux). An observer 
blinded to the genotype manually quantified grooming behavior using Noldus Observer. All 
instances of face-wiping, scratching/rubbing of head and ears, and full-body grooming were

 counted as grooming behavior. Statistical analysis was done using one-way ANOVA with 
Bonferroni multiple comparison tests.
 Social Interaction
A modified version of the three-chamber social interaction assay was used as previously 
described12,13,22. Only age-matched males were used for all tests. S129 males were used as 
stranger mice and were habituated to the test chamber for 3 sessions (20 minutes each) one 
or two days prior to the behavioral assay. On the day of the test, both test and stranger 
animals were habituated to the test room for at least one hour before the start of the assay. 
The left and right chamber of the three-chamber apparatus were both lit by 4–6 lux during 
the test session. Each test animal was first placed into the center chamber with open access 
to both the left and right chamber, each of which contained an empty wired cup placed 
upside down. This allowed the animal to habituate to not only the social apparatus, but also 
the cups that will eventually contain the stranger mice. After 15 minutes of habituation, the 
test animal was moved back to the center chamber briefly before the next session. During 
the social phase, an age-matched stranger mouse was placed randomly into one of the two 
side chambers while a novel object was placed into the other side chamber. The test animal 
was allowed to freely explore the social apparatus and demonstrate whether it prefers to 
interact with the novel object or the novel mouse. This social phase was also 15 minutes. 
The placement of the stranger mouse and the object was alternated between test mice to 
eliminate any confounds due to chamber bias. Time spent by the test animal in close 
proximity (~5 cm) to the cup containing either the stranger or the object was calculated. 
Analysis was done by an observer blinded to the genotype on Noldus Ethovision. One-way 
ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test was used for statistical analysis.
 Tamoxifen Preparation and Feeding
Tamoxifen (Sigma #T5648) was dissolved in corn oil at 20 mg/ml through vortexing. 
Freshly prepared tamoxifen was protected from light by aluminum foil and kept for 2–3 days 
at room temperature. Animal feeding needles from Harvard Apparatus (cat #52-4025) were 
used for oral gavage. To avoid toxicity of tamoxifen, the following dosages were used for 
adult animals:
Mice at 17–21 g body weight were fed 5 mg/day
Mice at 22–25 g body weight were fed 6 mg/day
Mice at 26–29 g body weight were fed 7 mg/day
Mice at 30–35 g body weight were fed 8 mg/day
The adult animals were fed for 5 consecutive days followed by two weeks of rest. Then the 
animals were fed for 5 more consecutive days followed by another two weeks of rest. Corn 
oil was fed as a control. The mice fed with tamoxifen and mice fed with corn oil were 
housed separately to avoid contamination. For induction of Shank3 expression in P20–P21 
animals, mice that weighed 7–9 g received 0.1 ml of tamoxifen or corn oil per day for two to 
three consecutive days. Mice that weighed 10–12 g received 0.15 ml of tamoxifen or coil per 
day for two to three consecutive days.

  Western blot
PSD and synaptosomal fractions of the striatum, cortex, and cerebellum were prepared as 
previously described21. Purified fractions were separated on SDS-PAGE and quantified 
using Odyssey Licor. β-Actin and Tubulin were used as loading controls. Specific primary 
antibody for SAPAP3 was prepared as previously described21. Commercial antibodies used 
include SHANK3 (Santa Cruz SC-30193), GluR1 (Millipore MAB2263), GluR2 (Neuromab 
75-002), NR1 (BD Biosciences 556308), NR2A (Millipore 07-632), NR2B (Millipore 
05-920), Homer1 (Chemicon AB5877, Synaptic Systems 160022), Homer3 (Synaptic 
Systems 160303), mGLUR5 (Abcam ab76316), CaMKIIa (Millipore 05-532), Shank1 
(Synaptic Systems 162002), Shank2 (Cell Signaling 12218S), B-Actin (Sigma A5441), and 
Tubulin (Sigma T5168). Statistical analysis was done using two-tailed Students’ t-tests.
 Dendritic Spine Analysis
Mice from WT (N=5), KO (N=4, 1 had to be euthanized due to lesion development), and 
TM (N=5) conditions at 6 to 12 months old, age-matched males were used. The pAAV-
hSyn1-EGFP-P2A-EGFPf-WPRE-HGHpA construct was cloned and sent for commercial 
viral packaging by Upenn Viral Core with serotype 2/9. Farnesylated GFP (GFPf) was 
previously shown to target the membrane29. To achieve sparse labeling, ~8–30 μL of this 
virus with titre of 4.04X1013 (GC/ml) was injected through the retro-orbital route into each 
mouse. Three weeks after viral injection, the mice were transcardially perfused with 4% 
paraformaldehyde and sectioned into 200 micron slices. Immunohistochemistry was 
performed by staining the slices with anti-GFP antibody (Invitrogen A11122) for 48 hours 
and 24 hours of secondary antibody incubation. The stained slices were then surrounded by 
a 240-um depth spacer (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and mounted with Vectashield 
Mounting Media.
Confocal images were taken with a 60X objective of the dorsal striatum. Spine count on 
intact neurons began 30–40 μm away from the soma and was extended for 10–60 μm from 
the origin. Spine density was analyzed automatically by Neuron Studio. All virus injections, 
imaging, and software analysis were done with the experimenter blinded to the mouse 
genotypes. Statistical analysis was done using one-way ANOVA, Newman-Keuls post-hoc 
test.
 Electrophysiology slices
 Dorsal and ventral striatum—Acute striatal slices were prepared from 3–7 months 
old age-matched mice. Animals were anesthetized by avertin intraperitoneal injection 
(tribromoethanol, 20mg/ml, 0.5mg/g body weight) and transcardially perfused with ice-cold 
oxygenated NMDG-based cutting aCSF solution (mM): 92 N-methyl-D-glucamine 
(NMDG), 2.5 KCl, 1.20 NaH4PO4, 30 NaHCO3, 20 HEPES, 25 glucose, 2 thiourea, 5 Na-
ascorbate, 3 Na-pyruvate, 0.5 CaCl2, 10 MgSO4 (~300mOsm, 7.2–7.4pH). Following 
decapitation, brains were removed for sectioning in the same ice-cold cutting aCSF using a 
Vibratome 1000 Plus (Leica Microsystems, USA). For all dorsal striatal recordings, 300 μm 
coronal slices were prepared, unless otherwise stated (Extended Data Fig. 3). For all NAc 
core recordings, 300 μm parasagittal slices were prepared and NAc core was identified by 
the presence of anterior commissure. Slices were recovered in the same cutting aCSF

 solution at 32°C for 12 min and transferred to room-temperature carbogenated regular 
aCSF(mM): 119 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 24 NaHCO3, 12.5 glucose, 2 MgSO4.7H2O, 
2 CaCl2.2H2O (~300mOsm, 7.2–7.4 pH). Slices were allowed to recover at least 1h and 
transferred to a recording chamber (RC-27L, Warner Instruments) prior to recordings. 
Stimulations were performed using a platinum iridium concentric bipolar electrode 
(CBAPC75, FHC). For dorsolateral striatum coronal slices, electrode was placed at the 
corpus callosum to mainly stimulate corticostriatal axons. For dorsolateral striatum 
parasagittal slices, stimulating electrode was placed at the cortex between layer V and VI. 
For ventral striatum parasagittal slices, electrode was placed dorsally to the anterior 
commissure at the border between NAc core and the cortex. Afferents were stimulated with 
0.1ms stimulation step (Isoflex, AMPI) delivered at 0.05 Hz frequency (unless otherwise 
stated). Slices were visualized under IR-DIC (infrared-differential interference contrast) 
using a BX-51WI microscope (Olympus). All slice preparations, recordings and data 
analysis were performed with experimenter blinded to the genotypes.
 Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)—Acute brain slices were prepared from 3–7 
month-old mice as follows. Briefly, mice were deeply anesthetized by intra-peritoneal 
injection of avertin solution (20 mg/ml, 0.5 mg/g body weight) and then transcardially 
perfused with 20 ml of carbogenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) ice cold cutting solution with the 
composition (in mM): 105 NMDG, 105 HCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 25 
Glucose, 10 MgSO4, 0.5 CaCl2, 1 L-Ascorbic Acid, 3 Sodium Pyruvate, 2 Thiourea (pH 7.4, 
with osmolarity of 300–310 mOsm). The brains were rapidly removed and placed in ice-cold 
and oxygenated cutting solution. Coronal slices (300 μm) were sliced using Leica VT1200S 
(Leica Microsystems) and then transferred to recovery chamber at 32 °C with carbogenated 
cutting solution for 8 min, followed by transferring to holding chamber containing aCSF that 
contained (mM): 119 NaCl, 2.3 KCl, 1.0 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 11 Glucose, 1.3 MgSO4, 
2.5 CaCl2 (pH was adjusted to 7.4 with HCl, with osmolarity of 300–310 mOsm) at room 
temperature. Slices were allowed to recover for at least two hours in holding chamber before 
recording and used for experiment typically between 3~7 hours after slicing. Layer 5 
pyramidal cells with a prominent apical dendrite were visually identified with a microscope 
equipped with IR-DIC optics (BX-51WI, Olympus) mainly by location, shape and 
pClampex online membrane test parameters.
 Extracellular field recordings
Slices were prepared from a daily group of mice containing all the 3 genotypes/treatments 
on randomized order, and recordings were obtained at RT with carbogenated regular aCSF 
(~2 ml/min rate). Borosilicate glass recording microelectrodes (King Precision Glass) were 
pulled on a P-97 horizontal puller (Sutter Instruments) and backfilled with 2 M NaCl. 
Recording electrode was placed ~400 μm away from stimulating electrode and field 
population-spike was evoked by a 0.1ms stimulation step (Isoflex, AMPI) delivered at 
0.05Hz frequency. Input-output functions were generated through consecutive rounds from 
0.1–1.0 mA in 0.1 mA increments (triplicate measurements per stimulation intensity). Three 
components were resolved in the recording traces: stimulation artifact, negative peak 1 
(NP1, presynaptic fiber volley) and field population spike. Amplitude for each component 
was determined by the average peak amplitude from triplicated measurements per

 stimulation intensity. Data was amplified using a MultiClamp 700B and sampled at 10 KHz 
using a Digidata 1440A acquisition system. Analysis was performed blinded to genotype 
using pCLAMP 10 software (Axon Instruments/Molecular Devices).
 Whole-cell recordings
Borosilicate glass recording microelectrodes (King Precision Glass) were pulled on a P-97 
horizontal puller (Sutter Instruments) and backfilled with CsGlu (mM: 110 CsOH, 110 D-
Gluconic acid, 15 KCl, 4 NaCl, 5 TEA-Cl, 20 HEPES, 0.2 EGTA, 5 Lidocaine N-ethyl 
chloride, 4 MgATP, 0.3 NaGTP). Internal pH was adjusted to ~7.3 with KOH and osmolarity 
adjusted to ~300 mOsm with K2SO4. Typical internal resistance was around 3–5 MΩ. MSNs 
were visually identified based on their shape, size and location under IR-DIC (infrared-
differential interference contrast), using a BX-51WI microscope (Olympus). After seal 
rupture and internal equilibrium (5min to allow proper dialysis of Cs+ internal), cells were 
recorded with series-resistance values < 20 MΩ (recording traces were excluded for data 
analysis if Rs changed by >20%). All voltage clamp traces were recorded in the presence of 
50 μM PTX (picrotoxin, Tocris) with theoretical liquid junction potential not corrected-for. 
Signals were filtered at 2 KHz, digitized at 10 KHz and data acquired using a MultiClamp 
700B amplifier and a Digidata 1440A. All analyses was performed blinded to the genotype. 
Grubb’s test was used to remove single outliers.
 Miniature EPSCs—Slices were perfused with RT carbogenated regular aCSF at a rate 
of approximately 2 ml/min. Voltage clamp traces were recorded at holding potential −70 mV 
in the presence of 50 μM PTX (picrotoxin, Tocris), 50 μM DL-APV (DL-2-amino-5-
phosphonovaleric acid, Abcam) and 1 μM TTX (tetrodotoxin, Tocris). Analysis of miniature 
EPSCs was performed using pCLAMP10 (Axon Instruments, Molecular Devices) and 
Minianalysis software (Synaptosoft Inc, USA) by manually clicking of individual events.
 Paired-pulse ratios—Slices were perfused with carbogenated regular aCSF at ~30 °C, 
~2 ml/min rate. Stimulus intensity was set to evoke 150–400 pA EPSC at holding potential 
−70 mV. Two EPSCs (inter-stimulus interval of 50 ms) were evoked for 10 consecutive 
traces. PPR was calculated by dividing the second EPSC peak amplitude by the first one.
 AMPAR/NMDAR ratios—Slices were perfused with carbogenated regular aCSF at 
~30 °C, ~2 ml/min rate. Stimulus intensity was set to evoke 150–400 pA EPSC at holding 
potential −70 mV. An average EPSC was obtained (~10 traces) at −70 mV and then at +40 
mV. AMPAR/NMDAR ratio was calculated as the ratio of the average EPSC peak amplitude 
at −70 mV (AMPAR EPSC) to the average amplitude of the EPSC recorded at +40 mV, 50 
ms after afferent stimulation. For pharmacologically isolated AMPAR/NMDAR ratios, dual-
component evoked EPSC at +40 mV was recorded before and after DL-APV bath 
application (50 μM, Abcam). NMDAR EPSC was obtained by digitally subtracting the 
average EPSC amplitude after APV application (AMPAR EPSC). For NR2B/total NMDAR 
ratio, dual-component evoked EPSC at +40 mV was recorded before and after ifenprodil 
bath application (3 μM, NR2B antagonist, Tocris) and ifenprodil blockable fraction was 
defined as NR2B EPSCs. DL-APV (50 μM) was then applied to block all NMDARs for 
measuring total NMDAR EPSCs. The fraction of NR2B containing NMDAR EPSCs is

 presented as the percentage of the total NMDAR EPSCs (NR2B/total NMDAR ratio = 
ifenprodil sensitive current divided by DL-APV sensitive current).
 Statistical Analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using Prism (GraphPad Software). All data sets were 
analyzed using D’Agostino-Pearson omnibus test and Shapiro-Wilk test for normality. Data 
sets with normal distributions were analyzed for significance using either unpaired Student’s 
two-tailed t-test or ANOVA measures with multiple comparison post-hoc test, using *P< 
0.05, **P<0.01, ***P< 0.001; all data presented as means ± s.e.m. Data sets with non-
normal distributions were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis test with adjustments for multiple 
comparisons. Based on previously published literature on Shank3 models10–13, we chose 
similar sample sizes for all experiments performed. All behavior test results for the 
tamoxifen treated cohorts are the combination of at least two different large animal cohorts 
that showed the same results. All electrophysiological, biochemical, and morphological data 
were obtained by counterbalancing experimental conditions with controls. Further details on 
particular statistical analyses can be found on the respective figures/results section for each 
data set.

 lower than that of the WT. *P< 0.05, **P<0.01, ***P< 0.001; all data presented as means ± 
s.e.m. Student’s two-tailed t-test for c (n=3 WT, n=4 TM, n=3 KO; each sample represents 
combined striatal tissue from 2 mice); Two-way repeated measures ANOVA, with 
Bonferroni post hoc test for d and e (n=12 slices from 4 WT, n=12 slices from 4 TM and 
n=12 slices from 4 KO mice). One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test for f (n=23 
cells for WT, n=26 cells for KO, and n=27 cells for TM). One-Way ANOVA, Newman-
Keuls Multiple Comparison test for g (n=32 dendritic segments for WT, n=30 for KO, and 
n=40 for TM). See Supplementary Figure 1 for gel source data.

 Figure 3. Adult Shank3 expression rescued repetitive grooming and social interaction
a,b, Significantly reduced repetitive grooming behavior in TM mice compared to KO mice. 
c, Representative heat maps from the social interaction test for all groups. d, Unlike WT 
mice, KO mice showed no preference for interaction with a stranger mouse; this behavior is 
rescued in TM group. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001; all data presented as means ± s.e.m; 
one-way repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test for a,b (n=9 WT, n=9 
TM and n=12 KO mice). Social interaction duration data (d, left panel) was analyzed using 
one-way repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test. Social interaction 
frequency data (d, right panel) was analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple 
comparison test due to the distribution not being normally distributed (n=22 WT, n=30 TM 
and n=30 KO).

 Figure 4. Restoring Shank3 expression in adulthood did not rescue anxiety and rotarod deficits
a,b, Open field tests indicated that Shank3 re-expression in adults (TM) does not rescue 
reduced locomotion and reduced rearing (axiogenic behavior) in KO mice. c, KO mice 
spend less time exploring the open arm in elevated zero maze test; this behavior is also not 
rescued in TM group. d, Motor coordination measurement from rotarod is not rescued in 
TM group. e–h, Germline rescued Shank3fx/fx mice (GR) show that all above parameters for 
open field, elevated zero maze and rotarod tests can be rescued if Shank3 expression is 
restored at germ cell stage. *P < 0.05, **P<0.01, ***P < 0.001; One way ANOVA for a (left 
panel), c; Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparisons for b (left panel). Two-
tailed t-test for e (left panel), f and g (left panel); Two-way repeated measures ANOVA with 
Bonferroni post hoc test for a (right panel), b (right panel), d, e (right panel), g (right panel) 
and h; All data presented as means ± s.e.m. (a–c: n=18 WT, n=25 TM and n=27 KO; d: 
n=13 WT, n=19 TM and n=21 KO; e–h: n=10 WT and n=8 GR mice).
