In retinitis pigmentosa, loss of cone photoreceptors leads to blindness, and preservation of
cone function is a major therapeutic goal. However, cone loss is thought to occur as a
secondary event resulting from degeneration of rod photoreceptors. Here we report a genome
editing approach in which adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 delivery to
postmitotic photoreceptors is used to target the Nrl gene, encoding for Neural retina-specific
leucine zipper protein, a rod fate determinant during photoreceptor development. Following
Nrl disruption, rods gain partial features of cones and present with improved survival in the
presence of mutations in rod-specific genes, consequently preventing secondary cone
degeneration. In three different mouse models of retinal degeneration, the treatment
substantially improves rod survival and preserves cone function. Our data suggest that
CRISPR/Cas9-mediated NRL disruption in rods may be a promising treatment option for
patients with retinitis pigmentosa.

 R
etinitis pigmentosa (RP) is characterized by progressive
retinal degeneration and is a leading cause of inherited
blindness, afflicting 1 in 4,000 live births1. To date, more
than 3,000 mutations in over 60 genes have been causally
associated with RP2 (https://sph.uth.edu/retnet/). Genetic defects
in a majority of RP genes initially lead to rod photoreceptor
dysfunction or pathology3. Rods are dim-light-sensing neurons
distributed throughout the retina with the highest densities just
outside of the macula2,4, whereas cones respond to higher levels
of light and mediate colour vision. Cone photoreceptors are
present at low density throughout the retina and at high density
at the centre of macula (called fovea), which is characterized by
absence of rods and responsible for the highest visual acuity5.
A typical RP patient initially manifests night-blindness with
gradual constriction of the visual field but sparing of central
vision. As the rod loss progresses secondary death of cones
ensues, leading to deterioration of visual acuity and eventual
blindness. The mechanisms underlying the secondary cone cell
death are poorly understood, and no effective therapy is currently
available for patients.
One treatment approach for inherited eye disorders consists in
correcting
the
underlying
molecular
defects
using
virally
mediated gene replacement, as exemplified by recent clinical
trials for Leber’s congenital amaurosis6 and choroideremia7. This
strategy has also been tested for RP in several animal models of
recessive disease with varying degree of success6. For RP caused
by a dominant mutation, inactivation of the mutant allele has
been evaluated in disease models using ribozymes8 and RNA
interference9, and by transcriptional repression using zinc finger-
based
approaches10,11.
Though
encouraging,
these
gene-
specific approaches appear to be less practical due to extensive
heterogeneity in the genetic defects underlying inherited eye
disorders. Therefore, gene-independent approaches targeting
common disease pathways are being actively pursued12,13. As
cone photoreceptors support daytime vision and visual acuity,
preserving cone function and viability is critical to the quality of
life of RP patients. One interesting concept that has been
proposed consists in reprogramming adult rod photoreceptors by
ablating neural retina leucine zipper (Nrl)14, a transcription factor
that specifies rod cell fate during retinal development and plays
a central role in maintaining rod homeostasis in mature
retina3,15,16. Ablation of Nrl in adult rods leads to loss of rod
features and acquisition of cone characteristics. This results in a
consequently improved survival in the presence of rod-specific
gene mutations, presumably preventing secondary cone loss14.
However,
this
proof-of-principle
study
was
conducted
in
Nrl-floxed mouse lines using inducible Cre-mediated gene
knockout (KO), which is not a practical therapeutic approach.
Additionally,
therapeutic
effects
were
only
evaluated
in
rhodopsin-KO mice. Whether this approach could be gene-
ralized to retinal disorders caused by dominant mutations, or
mutations in genes other than rhodopsin, requires further
evaluation.
Commonly
used
gene
knockdown
techniques,
including
antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes and RNA interference,
target mRNA molecules and as such, cannot completely abolish
gene expression. In contrast, the CRISPR (clustered regularly
interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 gene editing system
can efficiently disrupt genes at desired loci, enabling complete
gene KO17. In this system, a single guide RNA (sgRNA) directs
the Cas9 endonuclease to specific sites in the genome proximal to
a
protospacer
adjacent
motif,
causing
a
double-strand
break (DSB). Host cells efficiently repair DNA damage via the
non-homologous end joining pathway, and during this process
introduce insertions or deletions (indels) at the target site. Gene
disruption can thus be achieved if the target site is within the
coding sequence and indels lead to frameshifts. CRISPR/
Cas9-mediated gene disruption is rapidly becoming a routine
method for creating gene knockouts in cell lines and in animal
models17.
A large number of gene mutations in inherited retinal diseases
call for the therapeutic use of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, as it
could potentially provide a stable and long-term therapeutic
benefit. Towards this goal, in vivo knockdown of a mutant
rhodopsin gene has been conducted in rats18, with CRISPR/Cas9
components delivered by electroporation at postnatal day 0 (P0)
when rods are proliferating. More recently, adeno-associated
virus (AAV)-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 was used for targeted gene
disruption in retinal ganglion cells following intravitreal vector
administration in mice19. However, in vivo delivery of CRISPR/
Cas9 to postmitotic photoreceptors, which is therapeutically more
relevant for a majority of patients with inherited retinal
degeneration, has not been reported.
In this study, we establish an AAV-based CRISPR/Cas9 system
for targeted gene disruption in postmitotic photoreceptors, and
validate this approach by performing in vivo knockdown of Nrl in
the retina. Our studies show that loss of Nrl expression in rods
causes them to acquire cone-like characteristics, presents with
increased survival and leads to preserved cone function in
three independent models of retinal degeneration caused by
rod-specific gene mutations.
Results
An AAV-delivered photoreceptor-specific CRISPR/Cas9 system.
Expression cassettes of SpCas9 and sgRNA were delivered by two
separate AAV vectors (Fig. 1a). The Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9
(SpCas9) coding sequence was placed in between a photo-
receptor-specific human rhodopsin kinase (RK) promoter20 and a
synthetic polyadenylation signal. A human RNA polymerase III
promoter U6 was used to drive sgRNA expression. A tdTomato
expression cassette was included in the sgRNA vector to track
transduction (Fig. 1a). These vectors were packaged into AAV
type 8 (AAV8), a serotype transducing mouse photorecep-
tors
efficiently21.
Substantial
expression
of
tdTomato
and
Cas9 in mouse retina was observed following vector delivery
(Supplementary Figs 1a,b and 23). The RK promoter-driven
tdTomato expression was limited to photoreceptors, confirming
the photoreceptor specificity of this AAV-CRISPR/Cas9 system
(Supplementary Fig. 1c). Persistent expression of Cas9 nuclease
did not seem to affect retinal function even at the highest vector
dose (5 � 109 vector genomes) (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Knockdown efficiency of the AAV-CRISPR/Cas9 system was
evaluated using enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)
gene as a target. We first searched for protospacer adjacent
motif sequences within EGFP coding region22 and identified 119
potential 20-nucleotide protospacer sequences. Five sequences
with leading scores and three that were previously reported23,24
(ET1 to ET8, see Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary
Fig. 3a) were assembled into the sgRNA constructs (Fig. 1a). Two
of the sgRNAs (containing ET1 and ET3, respectively) exhibited
higher ability to form indels than the rest (Supplementary Fig. 3b)
and were able to abolish EGFP expression in cell culture
efficiently (Supplementary Fig. 3c–f). One of them (containing
ET3, Fig. 1b) was packaged into AAV8 (designated AAV-sgRNA-
EGFP) and was coinjected with AAV-Cas9 into subretinal space
of 2-week-old Nrl-L-EGFP mice, which specifically express
EGFP in rods (Fig. 1c)25. At P14, mouse photoreceptors are
postmitotic though not completely mature. At 2.5 months post
injection, efficient indel formation (11.95±0.1%) was detected in
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-enriched tdTomato-
positive photoreceptors by SURVEYOR assay (Fig. 1d). In control

 retinas receiving co-delivery of AAV-sgRNA-EGFP and an AAV-
Null vector, EGFP-expressing rods accounted for 91.9±0.1% of
the total dissociated cells, while tdTomato-positive cells indicating
sgRNA transduction accounted for 66.6±27.2% (Fig. 1e,f). The
sgRNA-transduced cells were predominantly rods, as 96.8±0.6%
of the tdTomato-positive cells were also EGFP positive. In
the retinas receiving codelivery of AAV-sgRNA-EGFP and
AAV-Cas9, the percentage of EGFP-expressing cells decreased
to 65.9±5.1%, while the transduction rate remained similar
(68.1±5.9% tdTomato-positive cells), indicating that B30% of
total rods abolished EGFP expression. Therefore, successful
ablation of the EGFP gene happened in estimated 43% of the
sgRNA-transduced rods. Lack of EGFP ablation in the rest 57% of
the sgRNA-transduced cells could be caused by lack of Cas9
expression, in-frame indels unable to abolish EGFP expression
and/or multiple copies of EGFP transgene in the mice25

 exceeding the capacity of CRISPR-mediated gene disruption. The
FACS gating strategy is shown in Supplementary Fig. 4. Retinal
whole-mounts and sections further validated EGFP knockdown
in rods (Fig. 2).
Nrl knockdown in postmitotic mouse photoreceptors. Among
the five designed sgRNAs (containing protospacer sequences NT1
to NT5, respectively) against the mouse Nrl coding region
(Supplementary Fig. 5a), the NT2-containing sgRNA (Fig. 3a)
was chosen for in vivo study based on its relatively higher ability
to generate indels (Supplementary Fig. 5b), and lower predicted
off-target potential. The vector was packaged into AAV8 and
designated AAV-sgRNA-Nrl.
A combination of AAV-sgRNA-Nrl and AAV-Cas9 (desig-
nated CRISPR-Nrl) was injected subretinally into wild-type (WT)
C57bl/6j mice at P14 (Fig. 3b). The fellow eyes were injected with
a combination of AAV-sgRNA-EGFP and AAV-Cas9 (designated
CRISPR-EGFP) as controls. Cotransduction of AAV vectors was
observed in a majority of photoreceptors following subretinal
delivery of two reporter AAV vectors (Supplementary Fig. 6). At
11 to 13 weeks post injection, the SURVEYOR assay revealed
formation of indels (4.1±0.6%) in FACS-enriched tdTomato-
positive cells (Fig. 3c). Deep sequencing of the sgRNA-Nrl region
indicated that 98% of total reads included changes almost
exclusively at the targeted genome site (Fig. 3d). The sequence
alterations were generally limited to one or two nucleotides
indels, resulting in frameshifts. Interestingly, one adenosine
insertion accounted for over 80% of the total reads (Fig. 3e).
This could explain the relatively low indel rate detected in the
SURVEYOR assay (Fig. 3c), as Surveyor nuclease only cleaves
mismatched heteroduplexes after denaturing and annealing of the
target amplicons, which were the minority species in this case.
To
determine
potential
off-target
events,
we
performed
deep sequencing at 10 predicted off-target sites, 4 of which are
top ranking and 6 are exon located. None of these sites revealed
significantly higher rate of sequence alterations compared with
the background in untreated or CRISPR-EGFP-treated eyes
(Supplementary Table 2). As AAV-delivered Cas9 and sgRNA-
Nrl were likely persistently expressed, long-term on-target and
off-target events were examined by deep sequencing at 9.5
months post treatment (Supplementary Fig. 7). The results
revealed a slightly lower on-target mutation rate (B93%) and a
similar pattern of sequence alterations with a predominant one
adenosine insertion (B88%), compared with those at 3 months
post treatment. Mutation rates at the predicted potential
off-target sites were again not significantly higher than those in
control groups (Supplementary Table 2), suggesting that long-
term expression of CRISPR components may not necessarily
impose a higher risk of off-targeting if the sgRNA is appropriately
selected.
Substantial reduction of the NRL protein was observed in the
CRISPR-Nrl-treated retina (Fig. 3f,g, Supplementary Figs 8
and 21). In control retina, nuclei in the outer nuclear layer
(ONL) were largely positively stained for both NRL and CRX. As
NRL is rod-specific whereas CRX is expressed in both rods and
cones, a few CRX-positive NRL-negative cell bodies in the outer
part of ONL were likely cone nuclei. In contrast, a majority of
ONL cell bodies in CRISPR-Nrl-treated retina were not stained
for NRL but were positive for CRX, indicating successful Nrl
ablation. The deep sequencing (Fig. 3d,e) and the immunofluor-
escence analyses (Fig. 3g) collectively suggest that two Nrl alleles
were disrupted in a majority of CRISPR-Nrl-transduced cells.
Phenotype changes following Nrl knockdown. Although outer
segments (OS), inner segments (IS) and ONL appeared normal,
the retinas receiving CRISPR-Nrl broadly exhibited larger nuclei
compared with the control retinas (Fig. 4a). In particular, some
photoreceptor nuclei had smaller heterochromatin regions unlike
typical rod nuclei and similar to that of mouse cones. Thus,
changes in the chromatin architecture in response to Nrl ablation
in some postmitotic rods suggest a movement towards cone-like
cells, consistent with S-cone being the default pathway3. To
validate these changes, we conducted Nrl knockdown in Crxp-Nrl
mice having a rod-only retina26 and performed ultrastructural
analysis by electron microscopy (Fig. 4b). In contrast to rods
in the control retina with small nuclei and a large mass
of heterochromatin, the CRISPR-Nrl-treated retinas revealed
some photoreceptors with cone-like morphology including bigger

the observations by light microscopy.
No obvious differences were observed between CRISPR-Nrl-
treated and control retinas in bipolar cells and post-photorece-
ptor synapses (Supplementary Fig. 9a,b), similar to previous
findings in Nrl � / �
mice28. Location of retinal ganglion
cells (Supplementary Fig. 9c), integrity of retinal pigment

(Supplementary
Fig.
10a,b)
and
retinal
vasculature (Supplementary Fig. 11) were not noticeably altered
by CRISPR-Nrl treatment, in contrast to those observed in
Nrl � / � mice29. Mild gliosis was observed in both CRISPR-
EGFP- and CRISPR-Nrl-treated retinas (Supplementary Fig. 10c),
indicating stress response likely caused by Cas9 expression and/or
by DSB creation and repair. However, location of Muller cell
nuclei was not altered (Supplementary Fig. 10c), different from
that of Nrl � / � retina29. These results collectively indicate that
CRISPR-Nrl treatment does not significantly alter the overall
retinal structure.

mice,
and
compared the result with the transcriptome of mature (P28) WT
rods and S cone-like cells from Nrl � / � mouse30. Although the
tdTomato-expressing cells contained both rods and cones, the
transcriptome alteration caused by Nrl ablation would largely
represent that happened in rods, as rods outnumber cones by a
ratio of 30:1 and appear to be transduced at a similar efficiency
as cones by an AAV8 vector21. A total of 146 genes exhibited
differential expression (90 genes upregulated and 56 genes
downregulated) between control (CRISPR-EGFP treated) and
CRISPR-Nrl-treated cells (Supplementary Data 1, Supplementary
Fig. 12a). In contrast, 6,412 genes were differentially expressed
(DE) between mature rods and S cone-like cells30. The low
number of DE genes following CRISPR-Nrl treatment suggests
the lack of plasticity of postmitotic rods for reprogramming into
cones. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of these 146
genes using GOrilla web tool31,32 revealed 20 enriched GO terms
(Supplementary Fig. 12b). Significance of the involvement
of these processes following Nrl ablation requires further
investigation. One hundred genes were common between DE
gene sets of CRISPR-Nrl-treated postmitotic and germline Nrl KO
photoreceptors and 88 of these exhibited similar up or down
expression trends (Supplementary Fig. 13).

 NR2E3 (ref. 3). As predicted, most rod genes were downregulated
after Nrl knockdown, although a majority showed less than
twofold reduction. Two of these, Nr2e3 and Reep6, displayed the
strongest reduction, 2.7-fold and 2.5-fold, respectively (Fig. 5a),
consistent
with
previous
studies33,34.
Interestingly,
most
cone genes were not upregulated (Fig. 5b), probably because of
transdifferentiation
barriers
including
epigenetic
modifica-
tions14. However, we observed striking upregulation (8.6-fold
and 5.0-fold, respectively) of two cone genes, Gnb3 and Arr3, in
Nrl-ablated rods, suggesting their specific derepression in the
absence of NRL. No significant changes were observed in Nxnl1
(also known as RdCVF) or Nxnl2 (also known as RdCVF2)
(Supplementary Fig. 14), genes encoding two rod-derived cone
viability factors, which play key roles in cone protection by
stimulating glucose metabolism35,36. Grk1, the gene expressed in
both rods and cones, did not show obvious change either
(Supplementary Fig. 14).
Significantly lower levels of NR2E3, REEP6 and higher level of
GNB3 were detected by immunoblot analysis in retinal lysates
after Nrl knockdown, with smaller changes observed in other rod-
and cone-specific proteins (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 22).
Immunofluorescence
studies
demonstrated
somewhat
lower
expression of rhodopsin, PDE6b and REEP6, and minimal
changes in S-opsin, cone arrestin and cone phosphodiesterase
(PDE) in the CRISPR-Nrl-treated retina (Supplementary Fig. 15).
The discrepancy between RNA sequencing and immunofluores-
cence for cone arrestin expression may indicate low sensitivity of
antibody. We also detected low-level expression of cone-specific
GNB3 in rods following Nrl knockdown, but the protein was
mislocalized to rod IS, unlike its native OS localization in cones
(Fig. 5e).
Rescue of retinal degeneration following Nrl knockdown. We
then tested whether CRISPR-Nrl treatment could modify the
course of retinal degeneration caused by mutations in rod-specific
genes using three distinct mouse models. An initial phase of rod
degeneration followed by secondary cone death has been well
documented in these mouse lines modelling human RP37–39
(Figs 6a, 7a and 8a). The mice were subretinally administered

 with CRISPR-Nrl vectors at P14, a time point before the onset
of rod degeneration. Same doses of CRISPR-EGFP vectors
were injected into the control eyes. Photopic ERG responses
representing cone function were monitored for 3 months, when
rod death is roughly complete in these mouse lines.
Rhodopsin KO (Rho � / �) mice were previously used for
inducible Cre-mediated Nrl KO14. As predicted, the eyes
receiving CRISPR-Nrl exhibited much slower decline in b-wave
amplitude (Fig. 6b), compared with the control eyes revealing a
sharp decline between P45 and P90. The CRISPR-Nrl-treated eyes
also displayed better responses under stimuli with a wide range of
flash intensities (Fig. 6c,d). In two additional control groups, eyes
receiving either the Cas9 vector or the sgRNA vector did not
show ERG rescue (Supplementary Fig. 16a,b). Though rod
function was completely lost in mutant retina (Supplementary
Fig. 16c,d), rod cell bodies were relatively well preserved following
Nrl ablation (Fig. 6e,f and Supplementary Fig. 17a). Cones were
protected in the CRISPR-Nrl-treated retina, as shown by
substantially more cells with S-opsin and cone PDE localized
to the OS (Fig. 6e and Supplementary Fig. 17a). To examine
whether treatment given at a later stage could still provide
therapeutic benefit, the vectors were injected at P28, a time point
when rod degeneration has already started. The results revealed
significantly thicker ONL layer and better cone ERG response in

(Supplementary Fig. 18), although to a lesser extent than early
intervention (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. 17a).
Rd10 is a naturally occurring mouse line with a hypomorphic
mutation in rod-specific Pde6b gene38. To facilitate tracking of
rod photoreceptors, we used Rd10 line that had been crossed with
the Nrl-L-EGFP line showing EGFP labelling in all rods. As Rd10
mice lose rods rapidly, they were dark-reared for 6 weeks after
treatment to slow down the degeneration process (Fig. 7a).
Similar to the observations in Rho � / � mice, cone function was
preserved after Nrl ablation as revealed by higher photopic ERG
b-wave amplitude (Fig. 7b,c). The rod cell bodies in the vector-
transduced area were relatively well maintained even at P90
(Fig. 7d,e and Supplementary Fig. 17b), suggesting that the
Nrl-ablated rods were able to resist the effect of PDE6b deficiency.
Cone viability was revealed by the nearly normal patterns of
S-opsin and cone arrestin staining in the CRISPR-Nrl-treated
retina, in striking contrast to almost complete loss and/or com-
promised morphology of cones in the control retina (Fig. 7d).
Cone-specific protein GNB3 was again observed in the IS of some
EGFP-expressing rods in addition to the OS of remaining cones
in the CRISPR-Nrl-treated retina (Supplementary Fig. 17b).

transgene on a WT background39 were used to examine
whether Nrl ablation may treat dominant forms of RP. In these
mice, rod degeneration is caused by defective vectorial transport
of post-Golgi rhodopsin vesicles and is complete within 4
months. The CRISPR-Nrl-treated eyes displayed much slower
photopic b-wave reduction and significantly better optomotor
response than the control eyes (Fig. 8b–e). Histologically,
markedly increased number of photoreceptors survived and
more cone opsin was preserved in the CRISPR-Nrl-treated retinas
(Fig. 8f,g and Supplementary Fig. 17c). The treatment appeared
able to inhibit the caspase-3-mediated apoptosis pathway of the
degenerating photoreceptors, although the caspase-3-indepe-
ndent pathways could also be involved in photoreceptor death
in the RHO-P347S retina (Supplementary Fig. 19). Collectively,
these results showed that rods receiving Nrl ablation treatment

 were more resistant to deleterious effects of the mutant rhodopsin
protein and consequently resulting in prolonged cone survival. In
an independent experiment using the three disease models, the
delayed cone function loss and prolonged rod survival were
observed in each individual mouse at 4 months of age
(Supplementary Fig. 20), suggesting that the therapeutic benefit
of this approach is long-lasting.
Discussion
Therapeutic genome editing has long been considered an ideal
strategy for permanent correction of genetic defects and is
advancing rapidly since the advent of CRISPR/Cas9 technology40.
Therapeutic application of CRISPR/Cas9 has shown promising
outcomes in animal models of several devastating human

 in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 application since the retina is easily
accessible surgically and is isolated by blood–retinal barrier.
Additionally, genome modifications can be targeted to specific
cell types, and a low amount of vectors carrying CRISPR/Cas9
should be sufficient for disease correction. Precise genome editing
following CRISPR/Cas9 treatment is conceptually achievable but
occurs at a rate not high enough for therapeutic benefit as of yet
since it relies on homology-directed repair, which is unfavourable
in postmitotic cells. In contrast, gene disruption or deletion
follows the non-homologous end joining pathway with efficiency
high enough for phenotype alteration, supporting its immediate
therapeutic application. In the present study, we have demon-
strated the efficacy and potential therapeutic benefit of AAV-
CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene disruption in mouse photore-
ceptors. To our knowledge, this is the first report of CRISPR/
Cas9-mediated gene editing in postmitotic photoreceptors in vivo.
We designed and evaluated a global treatment approach for
rod-mediated degenerative disease by disrupting the Nrl gene.
Indel formation was detected at the targeted Nrl locus in most
AAV-CRISPR/Cas9-transduced cells, resulting in remarkably
reduced gene expression. The transduced rods exhibited lesser
expression of many rod-specific genes and enhanced expression
of a few cone-specific genes compared with the WT, and
displayed
loss
of
the
rod-specific
chromatin
pattern
and
diminished rod ERG response. These alterations are similar to
those observed by Cre-dependent Nrl KO14. The discrepancy in
expression of a few genes between the two studies may reflect the
timing of intervention, percentage of Nrl-ablated cells, residual
NRL activity and/or assays used for evaluation. Although we
administered CRISPR-Nrl vectors at P14, 4 weeks earlier than the
Cre induction in the previous study14, we did not observe
enhanced derepression of cone-specific genes, probably because
of the slow onset of AAV-delivered Cas9 and sgRNA expression
and delayed Nrl disruption. It is also likely that genomic loci of
many cone genes have already acquired epigenetic marks by P14,
thereby preventing their derepression by Nrl ablation, as
demonstrated in case of Opn1sw gene in the previous study14.
The CRISPR/Cas9-induced Nrl ablation in postmitotic rods
did not seem to impact their synaptic connections with down-
stream neurons. Additionally, limited phenotypic alterations in
transduced
rods
did
not
influence
ganglion
cells,
retinal
vasculature or RPE integrity, unlike the Nrl � / �
mice29.
Cone-specific
visual
cycle
was
suggested
to
support
the
phototransduction after Nrl ablation in mature rods14. Further
investigations are necessary to elucidate whether the canonical
visual cycle is still the major pathway of chromophore recycling
for CRISPR-Nrl-transduced rods in the presence of an intact RPE
structure.
The most important finding presented here is that Nrl ablation
in postmitotic rods can mitigate the impact of retinal degenera-
tion initiated by rod dysfunction and/or mutations in rod-specific
genes, regardless of the pattern of inheritance. We used three
different
mouse
models
exhibiting
distinct
aetiology
and
pathophysiology of retinal degeneration—Rho � / �, Rd10 and
RHO-P347S. All three models responded favourably to the
CRISPR-Nrl treatment as indicated by a large number of
surviving rod cell bodies and relatively intact ONL. While our
study does not show how Nrl-ablated rods can tolerate deleterious
effects of disease-causing mutations, it is abundantly clear that the
presence of even dysfunctional or dysmorphic rods in the ONL
can protect the cone photoreceptors from secondary cell death
and preserve cone-mediated vision. Many explanations can be
put forward; these include coupling of rod–cone function,
retention of spatial organization in ONL, continued secretion of
cone survival factors by rods and reduced/lack of toxicity caused
by dysfunctional/dying rods. Regardless, our results support the
concept that cone death could be prevented or delayed by
maintaining rod survival.
Increased survival of Nrl-ablated rods may be attributed to
several factors, including downregulation of rod-specific genes.
Mutations in genes with important photoreceptor functions often
manifest their deleterious effects maximally in a fully differentiated
photoreceptor environment. Several examples serve to illustrate
this relationship. The Rd1 mutation in mice (PDE6 null) leads to
rapid photoreceptor loss related to greatly elevated cGMP and the
ensuing increase in cation flux through cGMP-gated channels
localized on the outer segment plasma membranes. When
combined with the Rds mutation, which disrupts OS morphogen-
esis, cGMP levels remained elevated but the rapid photoreceptor
cell death phenotype of Rd1 mutation was ‘rescued’45, presumably
because the cellular structure that enables increased cation flux is
compromised. Similar examples are found in the experimental
retinal detachment46, retinal organ culture47 and malnutrition48
models where arrest of development or disruption to the fully
differentiated state of photoreceptors are protective against
mutation-induced degeneration. Interestingly, treatment with
ciliary neurotrophic factor downregulates a large number of
photoreceptor late genes and offers a protective effect in mutant
retinas49. Another factor contributing to increased survival of
Nrl-ablated rods could be related to rods being more vulnerable
than cones to the deleterious effects of mutations, which has been
observed in both human patients and animal models50,51.
It is therefore conceivable that acquisition of certain cone-like
traits together with the downregulation of most rod genes in
Nrl-ablated rods promotes their survival.
In line with most preclinical gene therapy studies for inherited
retinal degeneration, earlier vector administration resulted in
better treatment outcomes (Fig. 6, Supplementary Fig. 18).
Intervention windows in the three disease models used in the
current study could be relatively narrow, due to the early onset
and fast progression of the diseases, and the relatively long time
course it takes for CRISPR-Nrl to abolish NRL expression.
However,
intervention
window
in
these
mice
cannot
be
extrapolated directly to human patients. In most patients with
inherited retinal diseases, noticeable loss of photoreceptors
usually happens in months to years. Therefore, the time course
needed for AAV-CRISPR to take effect does not seem to be
critical for human application. In future studies, our approach
can be tested in mouse models with relatively slow retinal
degeneration with intervention given at mid- to late-stage of the
diseases, better mimicking the treatment in humans. It should be
noted that although our approach significantly delayed photo-
receptor loss, it may not be able to completely halt disease
progression. Codelivery of genes encoding neuroprotective,
prosurvival or antiapoptotic factors should be considered to
extend rod survival so as to improve the treatment outcome.
In vivo use of CRISPR/Cas9 raises two major concerns. First,
in vivo expression of the bacterial protein Cas9 may cause
immune response and other unknown adverse effects. A recent
study has demonstrated cellular and humoral immune responses
in mice evoked by AAV-delivered Cas9 following intramuscular
administration, although significant muscle cell damage was not
observed52. Second, CRISPR/Cas9-induced DSB may happen at
off-target genome loci. These concerns are exacerbated by the
persistent
expression
of
the
AAV-delivered
CRISPR/Cas9
components in photoreceptors. Although little is known about
the consequence of long-term Cas9 expression, no major side
effects are reported in the Cas9 knock-in mouse lines53 that have
been used in a number of studies. We did not observe obvious
retinal functional defect even after high-dose administration of
AAV-Cas9 (Supplementary Fig. 2). Considering that retina is an
immune-privileged tissue, the immune response of Cas9 may also

11
 be
alleviated.
Additionally,
we
did
not
observe
off-target
mutations at 10 potential off-target sites even at 9.5 months
post treatment (Supplementary Table 2). A controllable system
that allows temporary but adequate expression of CRISPR/Cas9
components would reduce the potential side effects. As the
genome editing technology is evolving rapidly, more target-
specific CRISPR/Cas9 systems54,55 will be available, which may
ease the off-target concern. To improve efficiency, the current
dual-vector system in which Cas9 and sgRNA are separately
delivered can be replaced by a one-vector system, if SpCas9 is
substituted by a shorter Cas9 from Staphylococcus aureus56,57. We
believe that the continued development of this system will
enhance the safety and efficacy of retinal gene editing and will
find its applications in a wide range of retinal studies.
An important question from our studies is whether loss of NRL
function in adult photoreceptors can be exploited for treatment of
retinal degenerative diseases that are initiated in rods. The answer
requires further explanation. In Nrl � / � mice, loss of NRL
results in enhanced S-cone like phenotype15 and, after transient
degeneration, several layers of S-cone like cells survive and are
functional throughout life29. However, gain- and loss-of-function
mutations
in
NRL
are
responsible
for
diverse
human
retinopathies58,59. Unlike the rescue of retinal degeneration
phenotypes by Nrl-ablation in mouse rods reported here, is it
possible that loss of NRL in human rods will lead to cell death?
We suggest that the loss of NRL in mature rods will have a
distinct impact compared with what is observed by inherited NRL
mutations. NRL is required for determining cell fate during
retinal development15; however, unlike many differentiation
factors, its high-level expression is detected throughout life in
rods for maintaining rod function and homeostasis. While the
former role in cell fate is unique to NRL, the latter function in
maintaining rod gene expression is accomplished synergistically
with CRX, NR2E3, ESRRB and other rod-expressed transcription
factors3,16,60,61 and with epigenetic controls14,62. Thus, as we
report here, loss of NRL in adult photoreceptors is not expected
to lead to change in cell fate or reprogramming; instead, the
expression of many rod genes will be reduced or even abrogated
in the absence of NRL, and several cone genes will likely be
derepressed because of loss of NRL and dramatically decreased
NR2E3 expression. We propose that these dysmorphic and
dysfunctional
rods
can
overcome
rod-specific
degenerative
mechanisms and survive longer in diseased retina. Our studies,
therefore, provide novel insights into regulation of rod photo-
receptor homeostasis and suggest paradigms for treatment of
retinal degenerative diseases.
Methods
Mouse lines and husbandry. The C57bl/6j mice, Nrl-L-EGFP mice25, Crxp-Nrl
mice26, Rho � / � mice37, Nrl-L-EGFP/Rd10 mice38 and RHO P347S transgenic
mice39 were maintained in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) animal care
facilities in controlled ambient illumination on a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle. One
cohort of Nrl-L-EGFP/Rd10 mice was dark-reared from P14 to P56 after receiving
vector administration. Studies conform to ARVO statement for the Use of Animals
in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. Animal protocols were approved by the
National Eye Institute (NEI) Animal Care and Use Committee.
Construction and production of AAV vectors. The plasmid containing the cDNA
of SpCas9 with N-terminal Myc tag was purchased from System Biosciences, Inc.
(Palo Alto, CA, USA). For constructing the vector carrying SpCas9, the cDNA with
SacII and XhoI site was PCR amplified and placed downstream of a RK promoter20
and upstream of a short poly-A tail (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) in an existing
AAV shuttle plasmid maintained in the lab, using primers below:
SpCas9F: 50-AGTCAGACCGCGGGCCACCATGGCTAGTATGCAGAAA-30.
SpCas9R: 50-AGTCACTGCTCGAGTCACTTCTTCTTCTTTGCCT-30.
For constructing the vector carrying the sgRNA, a previously reported sgRNA
scaffold with human RNA polymerase III promoter U6 (ref. 22) was synthesized
and cloned into an existing AAV shuttle plasmid containing a RK-promoter-driven
tdTomato expression cassette. An AAV-Null vector plasmid which contains two
AAV ITRs without any expression unit in-between was provided by Sanofi
Genzyme Corporate (sequence available upon request). To generate a plasmid
with a ubiquitously expressed SpCas9, the RK promoter in the above-described
SpCas9 AAV shuttle plasmid was replaced by a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter.
Similarly, to generate sgRNA plasmids with a ubiquitously expressed tdTomato, the
RK promoter in the above-described sgRNA AAV shuttle plasmid was replaced by
the CMV promoter.
To make AAV vectors, HEK-293 cells (ATCC CRL-1,573; ATCC, Manassas,
VA, USA) grown in each roller bottle (850 cm2; Corning, New York, NY, USA)
were transfected with 150 mg each of the ITR-containing vector plasmid and the
two helpers encoding adenoviral components essential for AAV replication and
AAV2 replication (rep)/AAV8 capsid (cap) proteins respectively, by a calcium
phosphate transfection method63. After 48 h, the cells were collected and were
disrupted by a microfluidizer (model HC 2000; Microfluidics Corporation,
Newton, MA, USA). After removal of the cell debris, the cell lysate was digested
with Benzonase (100 U ml � 1) for 1 h at 37 �C. Vector particles were then
concentrated using 8% polyethylene glycol 8000. For purification, the vector-
containing solution was applied to caesium chloride step gradient followed by
ultracentrifugation. A second round of ultracentrifugation using a linear caesium
chloride gradient was then performed to ensure vector purity. The vector band
was collected with an 18-gauge needle, dialysed against Tris-buffered saline
(10 mM Tris-Cl, 180 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) with 0.001% Pluronic F-68 and stored
frozen at � 80 �C. Titres of the vectors were determined by real-time PCR using
linearized plasmid standards and primers against the RK promoter.
Screening of gene-targeted sgRNA candidates. HEK293 cells and HEK293-
GFP cells (GenTarget, Inc. Cat. No. SC001, San Diego, CA, USA) were cultured in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. To screen
eight EGFP sgRNA candidates, HEK293-GFP cells were co-transfected with the
plasmid containing CMV-driven SpCas9 and the plasmid containing sgRNA and
CMV-driven tdTomato using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA). Cells were collected at 48 h after transfection for SURVEYOR assay or
FACS. The sorted tdTomato-positive cells were routinely cultured and passaged
for 3 weeks before fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry and SURVEYOR
nuclease assay.
To screen five Nrl sgRNA candidates, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with
the plasmids containing Nrl cDNA, CMV-driven SpCas9 and sgRNA together with
CMV-driven tdTomato, using Lipofectamine 2000. Cells were collected at 48 h
after transfection for SURVEYOR nuclease assay.
Surveyor nuclease assay. The amplicons were PCR-amplified using primers
listed in Supplementary Tables 1 or 3 from genomic DNA of cells from different
groups, and were purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany). The amplicons were then denatured at 95 �C and gradually reannealed
to allow the formation of DNA heteroduplex. The annealed heteroduplexes were
digested with SURVEYOR nuclease (Transgenomic, Inc., New Haven, CT, USA)
following the manufacture’s instruction. The products were visualized on a 2%
(wt/vol) agarose gel. The intensity of the bands of the PCR amplicons and cleavage
products were measured by using ImageJ (v1.47)64. The indel ratio (indel%) was
calculated using equation (1)22,

where a is the integrated intensity of the PCR amplicon and b and c are the
integrated intensities of each cleavage product.
Subretinal injections. Mice were anaesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a
mixture of ketamine (80 mg kg � 1) and xylazine (8 mg kg � 1) and their pupils were
dilated with topical atropine (1%) and tropicamide (0.5%). Subretinal injections
were performed under an ophthalmic surgical microscope. An incision was made
through the cornea adjacent to the limbus at the nasal side using an 18-gauge
needle. A 0.5-inch 33-gauge blunt-end needle (Hamilton 207434) fitted to a
Hamilton syringe (HAM87931, 75rn) was then inserted through the incision while
avoiding the lens and pushed through the retina. Each mouse received 1 ml of AAV
vectors per eye. Fluorescein (100 mg ml � 1, AK-FLUOR, Alcon, Fort Worth, TX,
USA) was included in the vector suspensions (0.1% by volume) so that the vector
spread in the subretinal space can be visualized.
Immunoblot analysis. Nuclear protein from mouse retina was extracted using the
NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents (Life Technologies, Grand
Island, NY, USA) following the manufacture’s instruction for immunoblot analyses
of CAS9 and NRL. Total protein lysates of mouse retina were obtained using
radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing 1 � proteinase inhibitor.
Proteins were separated by SDS–PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room
temperature and incubated overnight at 4 �C with the primary antibody. Then,
blots were washed with Tris-buffered saline with the Tween-20 (137 mM sodium
chloride, 20 mM Tris, 0.1% Tween-20, pH 7.6) for three times and incubated with
the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary

 antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA, USA) for 1 h at room
temperature. After washing three times, the membranes were developed using
SuperSignal West Pico or Femto Chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). Primary antibodies used in this study are listed in
Supplementary Table 4.
Immunofluorescence. Mouse eyes were collected after killing. A blue tissue dye
was used to mark the orientation of the eye before enucleation to ensure that all
analyses were performed on equivalent areas. For fixation, eyes were immediately
placed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 1 h. The fixed tissues were soaked in 30%
sucrose/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight, quickly frozen and sectioned at
10 mm thickness.
For staining, the cryosections were blocked by 5% donkey serum in PBS
containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBST) for 1 h, and then incubated overnight at 4 �C
with primary antibody diluted in 5% donkey serum. Sections were washed three
times in PBST and incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies
and 0.2 mg ml � 1 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 1 h. Sections were
washed again and mounted in Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham,
AL, USA). Images were captured using a confocal scanning microscope LSM700
(Zeiss, Jena, Germany).
Cell count of ONL was made along the vertical meridian at three locations to
each side of the optic nerve head separated by B500 mm each. Each location of
sections from three individual animals was imaged at � 200 magnification and
cropped to a length of 300 mm. DAPI-stained cell bodies in ONL were counted
using ImageJ (v1.47)64.
For immunostaining of NRL and CRX, an alternative fixation was used. Mouse
eyes were frozen immediately after collecting and then sectioned at 10 mm
thickness. Brief fixation (5 min) using 1% formaldehyde was conducted before pre-
adsorption in 5% donkey serum in PBST for 1 h. Antibody incubation, section
mounting and imaging were conducted as described above.
Primary antibodies used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 4.
Secondary antibodies included donkey anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, anti-rat, anti-
chicken antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 or 647 (Life Technologies and
Jackson Immunoresearch).
Retinal whole-mount. To prepare flat mount of retina, mouse eyes were
enucleated as quickly as possible after killing and incubated in chilled PBS for
15 min. The orientation of the eye was indicated by intact nictitating membrane.
Eye balls were then squeezed gently several times to detach the retina and fixed in
4% PFA for 1 h. The retina was separated from other parts of the eye, washed with
PBST and mounted in Fluoromount-G, with photoreceptor layers facing up.
Imaging was conducted on confocal scanning microscope LSM700.
Pathological staining and electron microscopy. Mouse eyes were fixed in
PBS-buffered glutaraldehyde (2.5%)/PFA (2%) for 2 h, and dehydrated in an
ethanol series (50, 70, 95and 100%), propylene oxide and embedded in epoxy resin
(Embed 812; Electron Microscopy Science, Hatfield, PA, USA) or paraffin. For
Toluidine blue staining, semi-thin sections (0.5 mm) were cut and stained with
Toluidine blue. For haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, retinal cross-sections
(5 mm) were cut and stained with H&E. H&E or Toluidine blue-stained sections
were imaged with Zeiss Imager Z1 Microscope (Zeiss). For electron microscopy,
ultrathin sections (100 nm) were cut, post-stained in uranyl acetate and lead citrate
and observed by electron microscope.
Electroretinogram. A computer-based system (E2, Diagnosys LLC, Lowell, MA,
USA) was used for ERG recordings in response to flashes produced with LEDs or
Xenon bulbs. Mice were dark-adapted overnight. Anaesthesia and pupil dilation
were conducted as described above. Corneal ERGs were recorded from both eyes
using gold wire loop electrodes with a drop of 2.5% hypromellose ophthalmic
demulcent solution. A gold wire loop placed in the mouth was used as reference,
and a ground electrode was on the tail. For dark-adapted ERG, mice were stimu-
lated with flashes of increasing light intensity (from 0.0001 to 1,000 cd s m � 2).
Responses were computer averaged and recorded at 3 to 60 s intervals depending
on the stimulus intensity. For light-adapted ERG, mice were light-adapted for
2 min, and were stimulated with flashes (from 0.3 to 100 cd s m � 2) in the presence
of a white 32 cd m � 2 rod-suppressing background.
FACS and DNA/RNA isolation. Mouse eyes were collected after killing. Retinas
were isolated and dissociated in accutase (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) at 37 �C for
10 min with vigorously shaking. The cell suspension was filtered using Cell Strainer
(BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and washed using Hank’s balanced salt
solution. Dissociated retinal cells were resuspended in Hank’s balanced salt
solution for FACS.
TdTomato-positive cells were collected by FACS (FACSAria; BD Biosciences).
For the study of EGFP knockdown in Nrl-L-EGFP mice, cells with EGFP
fluorescence were recorded, but not necessarily collected. DNA was isolated and
purified from collected cells using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen) following
the manufacturer’s instruction. For RNA isolation, cells were collected and
dissolved in Trizol LS reagent (Invitrogen). RNA was isolated following the
manufacturer’s instruction.
Targeted deep DNA sequencing. Candidate off-target sites were predicted using
the CRISPR Design tool (http://crispr.mit.edu/)22. The fragments containing the
on-target site of Nrl gene and 10 potential off-target sites were PCR-amplified using
the primers listed in Supplementary Table 2. The amplicons were gel purified using
QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit, quantified using Nanodrop (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and pooled in equal ratio. An aliquot of the pool
was run on an Illumina MiSeq using a MiSeq Reagent Nano kit, ver2 (Illumina, San
Diego, CA, USA). This quality control run consisted of 25 cycles followed by two
index reads. The pool was then rebalanced based on the percentage of reads seen
for each amplicon’s indexes. The final pool is then sequenced on the MiSeq using
MiSeq Reagent Kit ver3 (Illumina) to generate paired-end 300 base reads. Post-run
processing of data is performed using RTA 1.18.54 and CASAVA (v1.8.2.). Aligned
Binary Alignment/Map (BAM) files were converted to FASTQ format using the
Bedtools software package65 and analysed using the CRISPResso software
package66.
RNA sequencing and data analysis. Total RNA of flow-sorted tdTomato-positive
cells was isolated using TRIzol LS (Invitrogen). RNA quality was assessed using
Bioanalyzer RNA 6000 Pico assay (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). Strand-spe-
cific mRNA sequencing libraries were generated from 20 ng of total RNA using
TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit-v2 (Illumina)67 and sequenced on Hi-Seq 2000
(Illumina).
Qualitative assessment of the FASTQ files was evaluated using FastQC
(http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). The reference
assembly GRCm38.p3 with gene annotation Ensemble 84 was used for alignment
and quantification. STAR68 software package was utilized for alignment and
gene-level quantification. ENCODE guidelines for parameter settings for STAR
were used and gene level counts were obtained by setting --quantMode parameter
to ‘GeneCounts’. Gene-level counts were used as input to edgeR69 package for
computing count per million (CPM) values and to normalize the data via library
size correction using the TMM normalization method. Limma70 package was used
to perform differential expression analysis that yielded the fold-change values and
its associated P values. All packages used were developed and implemented
in R programming language.
To identify enriched GO terms for DE genes, we used GOrilla web tool
(http://cbl-gorilla.cs.technion.ac.il)31,32. We chose two unranked list of genes
option and provided list of DE genes and list of genes that were expressed Z1
CPM in control (CRISPR-EGFP treated) or CRISPR-Nrl-treated data sets. For the
ontology option we chose ‘Process’ option, and all other options were set to default
values.
Optomotor test. Optomotor responses were tested using the OptoMotry system
(Cerebral Mechanics, Inc., Lethbridge, Canada). Mouse was placed in the centre of
a closed chamber surrounded by four computer monitors with a camera on the top
to monitor the action of the animals. Three-dimensional virtual images of rotating
drum lined with vertical sine wave grating were projected on the monitors. The
spatial frequency of the grating was controlled by OptoMotry software (Ver14).
Tracking of the gratings by the mouse was reflected by its head and neck move-
ment. The maximum spatial frequency (in cycles/degree) of each eye was measured
by systematically increasing the spatial frequency of the grating at 100% contrast
until the mouse no longer tracks.
Fundus fluorescein angiography. Fundus angiography of mice was imaged using
Micron III Rodent Fundus Imaging System (Phoenix Research Labs, Pleasanton,
CA, USA), equipped with a 390–490 nm excitation filter and a 500 nm long-pass
emission filter. Mice were anaesthetized and their pupils were dilated as described
above. The mice were then intraperitoneally injected with 10% of sodium
fluorescein at a dose of 0.02 ml per 5 g body weight. Fundus images were taken at
5 min after injection.
Statistical analysis. A two-tailed paired t-test was used to determine the statistical
significance between the eyes receiving the treatment vectors and the eyes receiving
the control vectors. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 6
(GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA).
