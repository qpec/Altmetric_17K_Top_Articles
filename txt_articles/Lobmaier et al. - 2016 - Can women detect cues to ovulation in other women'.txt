Recent research suggests that men find portraits of ovulatory women more
attractive than photographs of the same women taken during the luteal
phase. Only few studies have investigated whether the same is true for
women. The ovulatory phase matters to men because women around ovulation
are most likely to conceive, and might matter to women because fertile women
might pose a reproductive threat. In an online study 160 women were shown
face pairs, one of which was assimilated to the shape of a late follicular proto-
type and the other to a luteal prototype, and were asked to indicate which face
they found more attractive. A further 60 women were tested in the laboratory
using a similar procedure. In addition to choosing the more attractive face,
these participants were asked which woman would be more likely to steal
their own date. Because gonadal hormones influence competitive behaviour,
we also examined whether oestradiol, testosterone and progesterone levels pre-
dict women’s choices. The women found neither the late follicular nor the luteal
version more attractive. However, naturally cycling women with higher oestra-
diol levels were more likely to choose the ovulatory woman as the one who
would entice their date than women with lower oestradiol levels. These results
imply a role of oestradiol when evaluating other women who are competing for
reproduction.
1. Background
Ovulation cues in humans are subtle but perceivable (for a review, see [1]).
Women have been reported to dance and walk ([2], but see [3]), sound [4,5],
smell [6,7] and look [8–11] more attractive during the fertile days of their men-
strual cycle. Most of these studies looked exclusively at preferences of men
[2,5–7,10–12] as men directly benefit from ovulation detection in women: the
likelihood of reproducing is highest with a woman who is in her fertile cycle
phase (cf. [7]). For women, the benefit of detecting other women’s fertility is
less clear. Some researchers negate any adaptive function for women being sensi-
tive to ovulation cues in other women (e.g. [13]) while others have claimed that it
is also beneficial for women to detect ovulation in other women, especially in
the context of intra-sexual competition (cf. [14]). For example, ovulatory women
may be more likely to engage in poaching behaviours and they might be more
attractive to men, posing a potential threat to other (non-ovulating) women.
Indeed, previous studies have shown that men find ovulatory faces more
attractive [10,11].
Here we investigate whether women show a similar preference for ovulatory
facesto men. Women were shown pairs of faces, one of which depicted an ovulatory
face, the other a luteal face, and were asked to choose the more attractive woman.
According to some authors ([8], see also [15]), facial signals of ovulation might be
identical to what is typically seen as attractive in women’s faces. If this were true
we would expect that both women and men should find female faces showing ovu-
lation cues more attractive. Alternatively, if detecting ovulation cues is beneficial

 when competing for men (cf. [14]), then women might react dif-
ferently to ovulatory women (see [16]) but they might not
necessarily find them more attractive. To address this second
hypothesis, we additionally asked women to choose the
woman that would be more likely to entice their own date
away from them. We also collected information on intra-sexual
competition and examined whether women’s fertility detection
is associated with oestradiol, progesterone or testosterone
levels. These gonadal hormones have been suggested to play a
key role for intra-sexual competition [17,18]. We hypothesized
that individual differences in the capacity to detect cues to ovu-
lation are explained by psychological and biological markers of
intra-sexual competition (ICS [19], sex hormones). Specifically,
we expected that women with higher oestradiol and/or testos-
terone levels and higher ICS scores would more often choose
the ovulatory face, especially when asked to pick the face that
is more likely to entice their own date away.
2. Material and methods
(a) Stimuli
The current study used the identical standardized stimuli to [11],
differing only in shape between the luteal and late follicular
phase. In short, we first created composites of portraits of 18 natu-
rally cycling (NC) women who had been photographed both
during the late follicular cycle phase (ovulatory prototype) and
during the luteal phase (luteal prototype) using PsychoMorph
computer graphics software [20] (figure 1a; see the electronic
supplementary material, S1).
Twenty new frontal female portraits [21] were then shape-
transformed in two steps (50% and 100%) towards the follicular
and the luteal prototype ([20]; see the electronic supplementary
material). Each transformed portrait was paired with its respective
counterpart (figure 1b). The resulting 40 pairs (2 transformation
steps � 20 face identities) were shown in both lateralizations on
the screen, resulting in 80 trials.
(b) Online study
Data were collected online (www.unipark.de). Participants were
recruited on social platforms (e.g. www.facebook.com, www.
ronorp.net). Data of 160 women (146 heterosexual, 6 bisexual
and 8 homosexual), aged between 18 and 40 years (M ¼ 25.16,
s.d. ¼ 5.07), were included in the analyses.1 Of these, 77 used
hormonal contraception (HC) and 82 reported no use of HC
(NC) (1 non-disclosure). Participants gave informed consent to
take part in the study by clicking the corresponding button. The
face pair shown in fully randomized order and participants were
asked to choose the more attractive face by point and click. Each
face pair was shown until the participant’s made a selection.
After the experiment participants completed questionnaires
assessing demographical data, HC use, cycle information and
intra-sexual competition (ICS [19]).
(c) Laboratory study
Sixty female participants (59 heterosexual, 1 homosexual) aged
between 18 and 31 years (M ¼ 22.97, s.d. ¼ 2.60) took part in this
study. Thirty-one women reported use of HC and 29 participants
reported NC. All women were tested once; NC women were tested
during the luteal phase (6 to 8 days prior to expected menstruation,
using the backward-counting method), and HC women were
tested 6 to 8 days prior to pill break. They were naive regarding
the purpose of the experiment and were fully debriefed at the
end of the study. In the first block, participants were asked to
choose the more attractive face (attractiveness task). In the
following block, participants chose the face of the woman who
would be more likely to entice their date away from them (date-
enticement task).2 Order of blocks was held constant over all
participants.
To reduce the impact of diurnal hormonal variation, all test-
ing took place between noon and 19.00 h [22]. Participants were
asked to refrain from eating, drinking anything other than water,
and intense physical exercise for at least half an hour prior to the
experiment. Upon arrival, participants provided a saliva sample
using Salicaps (IBL International, Hamburg, Germany). An
independent laboratory (Dresden Lab Service GmbH, Dresden,
Germany) analysed testosterone, oestradiol (E2) and progester-
one in the samples using luminescence immunoassay kits
adopted for the analysis of salivary samples (IBL International,
Hamburg, Germany).
3. Results
We analysed the percentage choice of ovulatory face. Because a
paired t-test revealed no difference between the two trans-
formation steps (all ps . 0.73), the data were pooled across
transformation steps. Results showed that the ovulatory
face was not chosen more often than expected by chance
(0.50), t159 ¼ 20.05, p ¼ 0.961, d ¼ 20.01 (online study) and
t59 ¼ 1.21, p ¼ 0.231, d ¼ 0.31 (laboratory study), reflecting
that participants found neither the follicular nor the luteal
face more attractive. They also did not suspect either version
to be more likely to entice away their own date, t59 ¼ 1.48,
p ¼ 0.143, d ¼ 0.39. Choices did not differ between NC
women and women taking HC (all ps . 0.41).

 Simple regression analyses revealed that ICS (all bs , 0.07,
ps . 0.387) did not predict which faces were chosen in either
study or either task.
(a) Hormonal data
Independent t-tests revealed that NC women had signifi-
cantly higher testosterone (t58 ¼ 3.16, p , 0.01, d ¼ 0.83),
progesterone (t58 ¼ 3.28, p , 0.01, d ¼ 0.86) and oestradiol
levels (t58 ¼ 3.50, p , 0.001, d ¼ 0.92) than HC women.
Multiple stepwise regression analyses with all three hor-
mones were run for NC women, separately for each task.
Only NC women were included because HC women have arti-
ficially altered levels of gonadal hormones and it is unlikely
that hormones in HC women will carry equivalent information
to those occurring in NC women. In the date-enticement task,
the best fit was found by including only oestradiol levels (R2 ¼
0.22, F ¼ 7.54, p ¼ 0.011; b ¼ 0.47; figure 2). Table 1 depicts
coefficients and significance values of all three predictors in
the full model. When only considering women with high oes-
tradiol levels (median split), we found that women were more
likely to choose the ovulatory face as the one who would entice
away their date (t14 ¼ 3.08, p ¼ 0.008, d ¼ 1.65). No hormone
predicted the choices in the attractiveness task (all ps . 0.187;
table 1).
4. Discussion
We found that women do not find faces of ovulatory women
particularly attractive, but that NC women with high oestra-
diol levels were more likely to choose the ovulatory face
when asked which woman would be more likely to entice
the participant’s own date away from her.
Recent studies using the same [11] or similar stimuli [10]
have shown that men find the ovulatory face more attractive.
Such results can be interpreted as men’s ability to detect
‘leaky cues’ to ovulation, serving men in the arms race
between women’s effort to conceal ovulation and men’s
selective advantage to detect it. Alternatively, men’s prefer-
ence for ovulatory cues might occur because facial signals
of ovulation are identical to what is typically seen as attrac-
tive in women’s faces [8,15]. In this case, women (like men)
should find ovulatory faces more attractive than luteal
faces, which was not the case in this study.
While ovulation-linked cues do not render a woman’s
face more attractive for other women, we show that women
are not completely blind to these cues. We found that oestra-
diol levels in NC women predicted how well they were able
to discriminate ovulatory from luteal faces in a setting imply-
ing intra-sexual competition (date-enticement). This is in line
with studies finding positive associations between oestradiol
levels and competitive behaviour among women, such as
greater emotional reaction to sexual infidelity [23], or objecti-
fication of other women [24]. Our data suggest that in women
oestrogen is more related to intra-sexual competition than
testosterone. On the other hand, women with higher trait oes-
tradiol levels are generally thought to be more fertile. A more
functionalist explanation for women with higher oestradiol
levels being more attuned to the ovulatory status of other
women might therefore be that ovulatory women (who are
currently fertile) pose a greater threat to women with high
oestradiol levels (who are currently not fertile but have a
high potential fertility).
We note that we employed a between-participant design,
testing all women during the luteal cycle phase. Our aim
was to investigate whether women’s ability to differentiate
between ovulatory and luteal faces can be linked to inter-
individual differences in hormone levels. By showing that
luteal oestradiol levels (as they occur on an inter-individual
level) predict how often women choose the ovulatory face as
the one that would be more likely to entice away her
own date, we extend previous findings that have discussed
intra-sexual competition in the context of oestradiol levels.
It will be an interesting next step to relate the findings of the
present study to conception probability by investigating
intra-individual changes over the cycle (e.g. high conception
probability versus low conception probability).
One limitation of this study is the relatively small sample
size in the laboratory study. The association between oestra-
diol and the ability to discriminate between ovulatory and
luteal women needs to be replicated in the future studies
before it can be fully relied on.

 discriminate between ovulatory and luteal women’s faces in
the absence of any indication that women find ovulatory
faces more attractive. Detecting subtle cues of current fertility
in other women may serve to enhance women’s engagement
in specific mate guarding and/or competitive strategies.
