Abstract
Background and objectives Patients on hemodialysis have high 30-day unplanned readmission rates. Using a
national all-payer administrative database, we describe the epidemiology of 30-day unplanned readmissions in
patients on hemodialysis, determine concordance of reasons for initial admission and readmission, and identify
predictors for readmission.
Design, setting, participants, & measurements ThisisaretrospectivecohortstudyusingtheNationwideReadmission
Database from the year 2013 to identify index admissions and readmission in patients with ESRD on hemodialysis. The
Clinical Classification Software was used to categorize admission diagnosis into mutually exclusive clinically
meaningfulcategoriesanddetermineconcordanceofreasonsforadmissiononindexhospitalizationsandreadmissions.
Survey logistic regression was used to identify predictors of at least one readmission.
Results During 2013, there were 87,302 (22%) index admissions with at least one 30-day unplanned readmission.
Although patient and hospital characteristics were statistically different between those with and without
readmissions, there were small absolute differences. The highest readmission rate was for acute myocardial
infarction (25%), whereas the lowest readmission rate was for hypertension (20%). The primary reasons for initial
hospitalization and subsequent 30-day readmission were discordant in 80% of admissions. Comorbidities that
were associated with readmissions included depression (odds ratio, 1.10; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.05 to
1.15; P,0.001), drug abuse (odds ratio, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.31 to 1.51; P,0.001), and discharge against medical advice
(odds ratio, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.45 to 1.70; P,0.001). A group of high utilizers, which constituted 2% of the population,
was responsible for 20% of all readmissions.
Conclusions In patients with ESRD on hemodialysis, nearly one quarter of admissions were followed by a 30-day
unplanned readmission. Most readmissions were for primary diagnoses that were different from initial
hospitalization. A small proportion of patients accounted for a disproportionate number of readmissions.

Introduction
Patients with ESRD requiring hemodialysis (HD) are
twice (35% versus 16%) as likely to be readmitted within
30 days of discharge compared with general patients on
Medicare (1). This contributes to the overall economic
burden, because inpatient costs account for approxi-
mately 40% of total Medicare expenditures for dialysis.
Although national epidemiology of unplanned read-
missions has been described in other diseases, there are
limited data on patients with ESRD on HD, especially
those with non-Medicare insurance (2,3).
For the majority of patients on HD, the first medical
encounter after an inpatient discharge is at the outpa-
tient HD unit. As of 2017, outpatient dialysis units will
be indirectly penalized by the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid (CMS) for excessive readmissions as the stan-
dardized readmissions ratio (SRR) becomes part of the
ESRD Quality Incentive Program. The SRR compares
the observed number with the expected number of
readmissions on the basis of multivariable adjustment
for patient demographics, patient socioeconomic fac-
tors, and discharge hospital characteristics (4). Excluded
from the SRR are index admissions with discharge against
medical advice (AMA), certain malignancy index admis-
sion diagnoses, and readmission within the first 3 days
after discharge. Although the SRR is intended to incen-
tivize reducing readmissions, there is a lack of information
regarding characteristics and predictors of readmission.
Using a large, nationally representative, all-payer da-
tabase, we examined the national readmission rate in pa-
tients on HD, examined the concordance of primary
diagnosis on index admissions and readmissions,
and determined independent factors associated with
readmissions.

 includes discharge data from 21 geographically dispersed
states (Supplemental Table 1) and accounts for 49% of
hospitalizations in the noninstitutionalized United States
population. Data are drawn from the HCUP State Inpatient
Databases (SIDs), with verified patient linkage numbers so
that a person can be tracked across hospitals within a state.
These states were chosen, because they are geographically
dispersed and have verified patient linkage numbers on at
least 90% of adult discharges. The NRD only contains data
from community hospitals (nonfederal, short-term, general,
and other specialty hospitals, excluding hospital units of
institutions). It does not include data on rehabilitation or
long-term acute care facilities. The database has a weighting
variable that allows for national estimation, and it estimates
approximately 36 million discharges in the United States. The
weighting variable is derived from total hospitalizations
from SIDs and numbers of hospitalizations in the sampling
frame while taking into account hospital characteristics and
patient characteristics. The NRD does not capture index-
readmissions pairs that occurred in different states and does
not have data on out of hospital mortality. We selected the
year 2013, because we had full access to the database, and it
was the most recent public release.
Study Population and Design
We queried the NRD using Internal Classification of
Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM)
diagnosis codes to identify ESRD admissions. We excluded
admissions with the primary diagnosis code of ESRD and
those with AKI codes, because these patients were likely
initiated on dialysis during index admission. A list of codes
used to identify these admissions is in Supplemental Table
2. We excluded patients younger than 18 years old, on
peritoneal dialysis, or with a renal transplant. Patients on
peritoneal dialysis were excluded, because they represent a
substantially different population with potentially different
reasons for admissions. We also excluded those index
admissions related to pregnancy and for chemotherapy.
Readmissions that occurred the same day as a discharge
from an index admission were considered a continuation of
the index admission, because these readmissions were
likely due to unresolved issues from the index admission.
Finally, we excluded patients who died during the index
admission, index admissions in December (lacking 30 days
for accrual for readmissions), and those with missing
discharge disposition, discharge date, and hospital length
of stay. Two sensitivity analyses were done: the first one
included only hospitalizations where the primary payer
was Medicare and excluded those discharged AMA, and the
second one included admissions that occurred the same
day as a discharge. A study flow diagram is included in
Supplemental Figure 1.
Definition of Index Admissions and Readmissions
Index hospitalizations were admissions without any
hospitalizations in the preceding 30 days. Readmissions
were any admissions within 30 days of an index hospital-
ization (Supplemental Figure 2). Unplanned readmissions
were identified as any admissions that were not flagged as
an elective admission using a database variable. A hospi-
talization within 30 days of a readmission was considered a
readmission, and therefore, an index admission may be
associated with multiple readmissions as long as they were
,30 days apart. Readmission rates were calculated be-
tween index and first readmission, and they did not include
readmissions between the first readmission and the second
readmission, etc. This level of comparison was maintained
throughout the analyses, except for the comparison of
patient characteristics among those with one, two, and
three or more readmissions, which was on an individual
patient level. Although multiple readmissions per patient
may be correlated, a study evaluating 30-day readmissions
comparing methods accounting for correlation (general-
ized estimating equations and deduplication) did not find
that they were superior to basic modeling (6).
Statistical Analyses
Descriptive statistics were generated using chi-squared
tests for categorical variables, t tests for normally distrib-
uted continuous variables, Wilcoxon rank sum tests for
non-normally distributed continuous variables, and AN-
OVA for analysis of two or more groups; observations with
missing variables were excluded. Weighted numbers were
used for analysis. We calculated the crude number and
proportion to assess the most common primary diagno-
ses for index admissions and readmissions. We grouped
primary diagnoses of index admissions and readmissions
by Clinical Classification Software (CCS) codes for
clinically meaningful comparisons (7). CCS categories
were used to calculate the percentage concordance (those
with the same clinical category) versus discordance
(those with a different clinical category) between primary
diagnosis of index admissions and the first associated
readmission. The top ten CCS diagnoses were chosen as a
representative sample.
We used survey logistic regression to assess the relation-
ship between patient and admission characteristics and the
odds of the first 30-day unplanned readmission. This is an
appropriate analysis for data with nested, weighted ob-
servations, such as the NRD, which is inherently stratified
in clusters to produce national estimates (8). We adjusted
for patient demographics (age, sex, and median household
income category for the patient’s zip code), primary payer
(Medicare, Medicaid, commercial insurance, self-pay, or no
charge), and index admission characteristics (hospital size,
hospital type, private versus government control, and
discharge disposition). Discharge disposition was grouped
into routine or self-care, short-term hospital nursing
facility, home health care, AMA, and alive (unknown).
We used validated All Patient Refined Diagnosis-Related
Group (APR-DRG) scores to account for severity of illness
(9). Because the database did not have any information
regarding out of hospital mortality, this could not be in-
cluded in our analysis.
Comorbidities were defined using the NRD-defined
comorbidity measures and included in our model using the
CCS classification system, which aggregates ICD-9-CM
diagnosis and procedure codes into mutually exclusive cate-
gories as covariates. Because the number of chronic conditions
is limited to, at most, one per CCS category, a CCS category
count is an indicator of medical multimorbidity (10). We
also used another risk adjustment model using paired APR-
DRG as a categorical variable in conjunction with severity of
illness scores (11).

 To measure comorbidity effect on readmission risk at the
population level, which depends on both the adjusted odds
ratio (aOR) and the comorbidity prevalence, we calculated
population-attributable fractions (PAFs), taking into account
sampling weights using the survey package in R, version
3.2.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna,
Austria). The PAF is calculated using the aOR, controlling
for factors as described earlier, and comparing a hypothetical
scenario with the outcome being readmissions, where none
of the patients had the selected comorbidities, with the actual
outcomes from the data; 95% CIs were calculated by boot-
strapping (12,13).
All significance levels were two sided, with a P value
,0.01 considered to be statistically significant. Analyses
were done using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc.). Because we
used publically available deidentified data, the study was
considered to be institutional review board exempt.
Results
Readmission Rates and Characteristics
There were 390,627 index hospitalizations in patients on
HD identified from the NRD; 7861 readmissions were
flagged as elective and therefore, excluded from our ana-
lytic set, and 87,302 (22%) index admissions were followed
by at least one readmission (Supplemental Table 3). On
separate sensitivity analysis with only non-AMA patients
on Medicare and including readmissions that occurred the
same day as discharge found similar overall readmission
rates 21% and 22%, respectively (Supplemental Figure 3).
Table 1 presents the baseline characteristics of admissions
without readmissions and those with one or more readmis-
sion. Although readmissions were statistically different than
those without readmissions on several patient demographics
and comorbidities, there were small absolute differences.
Index hospitalizations with readmissions were less likely to
have commercial insurance (6% versus 8%; P,0.001).
There were significant differences in the index admission
characteristics between groups. Those with readmissions
were more likely to be admitted through the emergency
department (83% versus 78%; P,0.001), have nonelective
admissions (92% versus 88%; P,0.001), have higher APR-
DRG severity scores (70% versus 64% with major/extreme
loss of function; P,0.001), and have longer length of stay
(median, 3.8 days; interquartile range [IQR], 1.9–7.1 versus
median, 3.3 days; IQR, 1.7–6.2; P,0.001).
Primary Diagnosis on Index Admissions and Concordance on

The top ten primary diagnoses on index admission were for
complications of vascular access (which included admissions
for arteriovenous fistulas/grafts/central venous catheters;

 11%), hypertension (8%), septicemia (6%), congestive heart
failure (6%), fluid disorder (6%), diabetes mellitus (5%),
pneumonia (5%), cardiac dysrhythmias (2%), acute myocar-
dial infarction (AMI; 2%), and chest pain (2%), respectively
(Figure 1); this represented 54% of all index admissions. The
absolute number of patients within these diagnoses strati-
fied by readmission categories is shown in Supplemental
Figure 4. AMI index admissions had the highest percentage
of readmissions (25%), whereas hypertension had the lowest
percentage of readmissions (20%) (Figure 1).
The primary diagnosis on index admission and associ-
ated first readmission were discordant for an average of 80%
of admissions within the top ten index admission diagnosis.
The percentage of discordance varied by admission di-
agnoses: the highest for chest pain (94%) and the lowest for
diabetes mellitus (68%) (Figure 2).
Characteristics of Multiple Readmissions
Patients with three or more readmissions, referred to as high

 20% of all readmissions (Supplemental Figure 5). High
utilizers compared with patients with only two readmissions
or one readmission were younger (median age, 55 years old;
IQR, 44–67 versus median age, 62 years old; IQR, 50–82 versus
median age, 63 years old; IQR, 53–73, respectively; P,0.001),
were more often men (56% versus 50% versus 50%, re-
spectively; P,0.001), and had multiple comorbidities, notably
AIDS (2% versus 0.9% versus 0.7%, respectively; P,0.001),
depression (13% versus 11% versus 11%, respectively;
P,0.001), and drug abuse (8% versus 5% versus 4%, re-
spectively; P,0.001). They were less likely to have insurance
(6% versus 2% versus 2%, respectively; P,0.001) and live in
zip codes within the 76%–100% for median income (13%
versus 14% versus 15%, respectively; P,0.001). They were
more likely to be admitted to metropolitan teaching hospitals
(55% versus 41% versus 40%, respectively; P,0.001) (Table 2).
Significant Predictors of Unplanned Readmission
On multivariate analysis, the following demographics
were significantly associated with increased readmission:
younger age of 18–34, 35–49, and 50–64 years old (aOR,
1.35; 95% CI, 1.26 to 1.45; aOR, 1.09, 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.14;
aOR, 1.06, 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.10, respectively) compared
with $65 years old and women (aOR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.05 to
1.11). Within insurance categories, commercial insurance
had the lowest odds of readmission compared with
Medicaid (aOR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.74). The comorbid-
ities with the highest aORs for readmissions were drug
abuse (aOR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.31 to 1.51), liver disease (aOR,
1.21; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.27), and chronic pulmonary disease
(aOR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.20). Of note, depression was
highly associated with readmissions (aOR, 1.10; 95% CI,
1.05 to 1.15) (Table 3). Index admissions characteristics
associated with increased readmission odds included
extreme loss of function on the APR-DRG severity scale
(aOR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.31 to 1.63), length of stay $7 days
(aOR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.16 to 1.26), and discharge AMA (aOR,
1.57; 95% CI, 1.45 to 1.70).
We calculated PAFs for comorbidities with increased
adjusted odds of readmission (Supplemental Table 4).
The highest partial PAFs were for hypertension (3.7%),
chronic pulmonary disease (2.5%), and heart failure (1.9%).
However, the PAFs for drug abuse (0.9%) and depression
(0.8%) were on par with diabetes mellitus (0.9%) and higher
than those for AIDS (0.06%) and liver disease (0.7%).
Discussion
Using a nationally representative all-payer database, we
elucidated the top ten diagnoses for admissions in patients
with ESRD on HD. The overall readmission rate was 22%,
and on average, 80% of readmissions diagnoses were
discordant to index admission. Interestingly, 2% of patients
on HD accounted for 20% of all readmissions, and these
high utilizers differed in many aspects from other patients
on HD. Finally, we identified patient and hospital charac-
teristics independently associated with increased odds of
readmission.
Although the readmission rate that we report is low
compared with that of the US Renal Data System (USRDS;
37%), it is similar to that of other studies (20%–24%) (1,14–
17). Studies using the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice
Patterns (DOPPS) data report a similar readmission rate,
whereas Canadian studies show a substantially lower
readmission rate: 15%–17% (18–21). Although the USRDS
reports readmissions at the admission level and only
includes patients on Medicare, we reported readmissions
at the patient level and included patients not on Medicare
(20%). Analysis of Medicare non-AMA hospitalizations
revealed no substantial difference in readmission rates.
The rate may also be affected, because the database does
not capture readmissions that occurred across states.
Lastly, we are unable to determine the number of patients
who were discharged and died outside of the hospital,
which may have contributed to the lower readmission rate
seen in this dataset. Despite the lower readmission rates in
this study, nearly one quarter of all admissions were followed
by an unplanned readmission. Although the CMS has been
tracking readmissions for multiple diagnoses since 2007, only
recently has the CMS decided to track ESRD readmissions
(22). Although currently, only Medicare payments will be
penalized, other insurances are likely to follow Medicare’s
example (23,24).
The discordance between index and readmission diagno-
ses is similar to that in other chronic disease (i.e., congestive
heart failure, AMI, and pneumonia) hospitalizations, which
report 19%–37% concordance (2,25). In contrast, an analysis
of the DOPPS found nearly 50% concordance; this may have
been due to differences in methodology, including diagnoses
classification and the inclusion of chemotherapy-related
hospitalizations, which showed the highest concordance
(18). We categorized diagnoses using the CCS, which may
lead to loss of granularity; however, it enhances the likeli-
hood that concordance categorization is accurate.
The high readmission rates and the discordance with
admission diagnosis may be reflective of the high disease
burden in patients with ESRD rather than poor care at index
admission. An analysis of patients on Medicare found that
additional adjustments not included in the Medicare risk-
adjustment model explained a substantial proportion of the
difference in readmission risk between hospitals (26).
Research using more granular data is needed to determine
whether the readmissions due to a different clinical reason
are preventable and whether focusing on the overall care of
the multimorbid patient with ESRD rather than individual
diagnoses might improve readmission rates.
Interventions to reduce ESRD readmissions have not
targeted the subset of patients with psychosocial comor-
bidities (27–29). Although the PAFs were low due to the
low prevalence, psychosocial comorbidities are often un-
der-recognized during acute hospitalizations and under-
diagnosed in the ESRD population, despite evidence that
they are associated with readmissions in both patients on
HD and patients not on HD (30–33). Additionally, these
characteristics are associated with increased odds of
emergency room utilization (34). Therefore, research
should focus on identifying interventions that can improve
care in patients with these psychosocial comorbidities,
because improvements will have a global effect on not only
hospital readmissions but also, emergency department
utilization.
An unexpected finding is that younger age was associated
with readmissions, and the high-utilizer group was nearly 10
years younger than those with one readmission. Potential

 explanations may be due to the higher proportion of patients
without insurance; however, this needs to be further ex-
plored. Others have speculated on the effect of higher rates of
nonadherence and underlying psychosocial factors in youn-
ger patients (3,35) Unfortunately, nonadherence and psycho-
social factors are often under-reported and difficult to capture
in electronic medical records. Although discharge alive
destination unknown was associated with lower odds of
readmission, the meaning of this finding is unclear, because
only 20 hospitalizations were under this category.
A potential area of interest is collaborative mental health
care in outpatient dialysis units or improvement in referrals
to psychiatric professionals, which has been shown to
reduce health care utilization and improve outcomes in
other chronic diseases (36,37). Another potential inter-
vention in the dialysis setting is increasing the number of
nephrology visits, because one additional visit in the
month after hospital discharge was estimated to reduce
30-day readmissions by 3.5% in patients with ESRD (16).
Special focus on risk conditions identified in our analysis
may help identify patients to target for more frequent
visits. The high readmission rates, regardless of initial
admission diagnoses, suggest that effective interventions to
reduce admissions would have a widespread effect across
admission diagnoses.
Our study should be interpreted in the context of several
limitations. First, the database used in this analysis did not
capture certain granular patient-level data, such as dialysis
vintage, outpatient dialysis unit, laboratory data, shortened
and/or skipped HD treatments, vascular access type, and
race, which are important risk predictors. The use of
administrative codes is likely to misclassify patients; a
systematic review shows a sensitivity ranging from 40%
to 80% but a specificity of .90% (38). Second, the broad
groupings of diagnoses codes used to assess discordance
between index admissions and readmissions could mis-
classify some admission-readmission pairs. However, the
CCS schema was designed to group diagnoses into clini-
cally meaningful categories; therefore, misclassification may
not be clinically relevant. Third, this study did not address
discharge factors, such as discharge date over the weekend,
that were recently shown to also be predictive of 30-
day readmission in patients on HD (39). The relevance
of discharge factors to 30-day readmission supports shared
accountability between the dialysis clinic and the acute
care hospital, which would, in turn, foster care coordination
between these settings. Fourth, we recognize that the overall
prevalence of multiple significant predictors is low; however,
these predictors may help identify a small group of patients
who would benefit most from effective interventions to
reduce readmissions. Despite these limitations, the benefit
of using a large, representative, all-payer sample affords a
truly national perspective, and these findings are highly
generalizable to the United States ESRD population, in-
cluding the 20% of the patients who do not have Medicare
and thus, are not captured by the USRDS.

 In conclusion, this study highlights the high proportion of
readmissions in the ESRD population and how a small
minority of patients with ESRD are responsible for a dispro-
portionate number of readmissions. We show that most
readmission diagnoses are different from the index admis-
sion and that several predictors of readmissions are psy-
chosocial in nature. If we were to attempt to improve
readmissions in the vulnerable ESRD population, perhaps a
good starting place would be to institute interventions
targeted at high utilizers and create a validated risk score
incorporating psychosocial factors (40). However, further
studies are necessary to determine if interventions decrease
30-day readmission rates and improve patient outcomes.
