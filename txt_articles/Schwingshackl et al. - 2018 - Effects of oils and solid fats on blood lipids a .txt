modifiable risk factors for the development of CVD (2). 
The controversial association between dietary fatty acids, 
blood lipids, and CVD has been intensively studied for 
more than a half century (3). It is well-established that satu-
rated fatty acids (SFAs), when replaced with either PUFAs 
or MUFAs, decrease LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), a strong 
risk factor for CVD (4). Moreover, consuming PUFAs in-
stead of SFAs reduced coronary heart disease (CHD) events 
in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (5). Paradoxically, 
some studies reported that replacement of SFAs in the diet 
with linoleic acid reduced serum cholesterol levels, but did 
not lower risk of CHD mortality (6).
A major disadvantage when analyzing dietary fatty acids 
is the limited interpretation when compared with the more 
realistic analyses of specific oils and solid fats. Moreover, 
findings on dietary acids are more difficult to transfer into 
recommendations on primary prevention of noncommuni-
cable chronic diseases (7). Pairwise meta-analyses showed 
that n-3- and n-6-rich plant oils were more effective in re-
ducing LDL-C and total cholesterol (TC) compared with 
olive oil (8), whereas palm oil consumption increased 
LDL-C considerably more than vegetable oils low in SFAs 
(9). Although, the effects of oils on blood lipids can be 
predicted from their fatty acid composition (10), one ques-
tion that still remains to be answered is: which type of oils/
solid fats offers the greatest improvements on blood lipids, 
combining direct and indirect evidence? To address this 
issue in the present systematic review, we used the method-
ology of network meta-analysis (NMA), which enables a 
simultaneous comparison of intervention trials (11).
Abstract The aim of this network meta-analysis (NMA) is to 
compare the effects of different oils/solid fats on blood lip-
ids. Literature searches were performed until March 2018. 
Inclusion criteria were as follows: i) randomized trial (3 
weeks study length) comparing at least two of the following 
oils/solid fats: safflower, sunflower, rapeseed, hempseed, 
flaxseed, corn, olive, soybean, palm, and coconut oil, and 
lard, beef-fat, and butter; ii) outcomes LDL-cholesterol 
(LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), 
and triacylglycerols (TGs). A random dose-response (per 
10% isocaloric exchange) NMA was performed and surface 
under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was estimated. 
Fifty-four trials were included in the NMA. Safflower oil had 
the highest SUCRA value for LDL-C (82%) and TC (90%), 
followed by rapeseed oil (76% for LDL-C, 85% for TC); 
whereas, palm oil (74%) had the highest SUCRA value for 
TG, and coconut oil (88%) for HDL-C. Safflower, sunflower, 
rapeseed, flaxseed, corn, olive, soybean, palm, and coconut 
oil as well beef fat were more effective in reducing LDL-C 
(0.42 to 0.23 mmol/l) as compared with butter.
 Despite 
limitations in these data, our NMA findings are in line with 
existing evidence on the metabolic effects of fat and support 
current recommendations to replace high saturated-fat food 
with unsaturated oils.—Schwingshackl, L., B. Bogensberger,

of oils and solid fats on blood lipids: a systematic review and

NMA combines direct (i.e., from trials comparing two 
interventions directly) and indirect (i.e., from a connected 
root via one or more intermediate comparators) evidence 
in a network of trials (Fig. 1). In this way, it enables infer-
ence about every possible comparison between a pair of 
interventions in the network, even when some compari-
sons have never been evaluated in a trial. In a theoretical 
example, none of the studies have compared B (butter) 
and C (palm oil), but each has been compared with a com-
mon comparator A (olive oil), then we assume an indirect 
comparison of B and C on the direct comparison of B and 
A and the direct comparison of C and A (Fig. 1).
To the best of our knowledge, no study has been con-
ducted to date that simultaneously compares different 
oils/solid fats on blood lipids.
In brief, the aim of the present study was to compare the 
effects of 13 different oils and solid fats across randomized 
trials on established blood lipid factors [TC, LDL-C, HDL-
cholesterol (HDL-C), and triacylglycerols (TGs)] using 
NMA methodology.
METHODS AND DESIGN
This review was registered in PROSPERO International Pro-
spective Register of Systematic Reviews (https://www.crd.york.
ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=56513). The present 
NMA was planned, conducted, and reported in adherence to 
standards of quality for reporting NMAs (12, 13).
Search strategy
The literature search was performed using the electronic data-
bases PubMed and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 
(CENTRAL) until March 2018 with no restriction of language 
and calendar date using a predefined search strategy (supplemen-
tal Appendix S1).
The reference lists from the identified articles were screened to 
search for additional relevant studies. Searches were conducted 
by two authors (B.B., L.S.) with disagreements being resolved by 
involvement of other authors (G.H., H.B.).
Eligibility criteria
Studies were included in the NMA if they met all of the follow-
ing criteria: i) randomized study (parallel or cross-over design) 
examining diets varying in composition of at least two of the fol-
lowing oils/solid fats: safflower, sunflower, rapeseed, hempseed, 
flaxseed, corn, olive, soybean, palm, and coconut oil, and lard, 
beef fat, and butter; ii) comparison of isocaloric exchange of the 
different oils/solid fats within a trial; iii) minimum intervention 
period of 3 weeks; iv) patients with a mean age 18 years; v) out-
comes including: LDL-C (defined as primary outcome in the pres-
ent NMA) and TC, HDL-C, and TGs (defined as secondary 
outcomes in the present NMA).
The following studies were excluded: i) RCTs including preg-
nant women, children and adolescents, and patients with cancer, 
hemodialysis, or type 1 diabetes; ii) RCTs of acute (single meal) 
postprandial effects only; iii) RCTs using mixed oils or using but-
ter plus mixed oils in the intervention arms; iv) RCTs using en-
capsulated oil supplements; v) RCTs using fish oils or MCT oils, 
or omega-3 fatty enriched oils/solid fats; vi) RCTs implementing 
enrichment of oils/solid fats with plant sterols, plant stanols; vii) 
RCTs based on liquid/formula diets; viii) co-intervention (e.g., 
drug, diet, or exercise) not applied in all intervention arms.
Data extraction
After determination of the study selection, one reviewer ex-
tracted the following characteristics: name of first author, year of 
publication, study origin (country), study design (RCT: parallel 
or cross-over), comparison of oils/solid fats, sample size (com-
pleters), disease status (i.e., healthy, obese, hypercholesterolemia, 
peripheral disease), mean age, mean BMI, percent type 2 diabetics, 
percent female, study length (weeks), specification of the inter-
vention arms (type of oil/solid fat used and amount of intake; 
provided by investigators or simply advice), underlying type of 
diet (i.e., habitual, healthy; provided by investigators or simply 
advice; weight loss: yes vs. no), primary outcome of the study, out-
comes extracted for the present NMA, and conflict of interest. 
Outcome data included postintervention values with correspond-
ing standard deviations. The extracted information was verified 
by a second reviewer (A.B. or L.S.).
Risk of bias assessment
Full copies of the studies were assessed by two authors (L.S., 
B.B.) for methodological quality using the risk of bias assessment 
tool from the Cochrane Collaboration (14). The following sources 
of bias were assessed: selection bias (random sequence genera-
tion and allocation concealment), performance bias (blinding of 
participants and personnel), detection bias (blinding of outcome 
assessment), attrition bias (incomplete outcome data), and re-
porting bias (selective reporting).
Studies were classified as being at either low risk of bias (if at 
least three out of a maximum of six items were rated as low risk 
and no item was rated with a high risk of bias), high risk of bias (if 
at least one item was rated with a high risk of bias), or moderate/
unclear risk of bias (all other studies).
Data synthesis
Description of the available data. For all included trials, we pres-
ent study and population characteristics describing the available 
data and important variables (e.g., age, BMI, length of follow-up, 
sample size, percent female, disease status, and specification of 
diet). We illustrated the available direct comparisons between dif-
ferent oils/solid fats using a network diagram for each outcome 
(15). The size of the nodes is proportional to the sample size of 
each dietary intervention and the thickness of the lines propor-
tional to the number of studies available.
Assessment of transitivity. To evaluate the assumption of transi-
tivity, we compared the distribution of the potential effect modi-
fiers across the available direct comparisons. We considered the 
following effect modifiers: age, BMI, study length, and sample size.
Statistical analysis. For each outcome measure of interest, we 
performed random effects NMA in order to determine the pooled

relative effect of each intervention against every other measure in 
terms of the postintervention values. We assessed the similarity of 
trials within each direct comparison. NMA was then used to syn-
thesize the direct and indirect effects. The method of NMA is an 
extension of the standard pairwise meta-analysis that enables a 
 
simultaneous comparison of multiple interventions, forming a 
connected network while preserving the internal randomization 
of individual trials. We ran random effects dose-response NMA 
(intake of oils/solid fats was standardized and presented per 10% 
isocaloric exchange) for each outcome to estimate all possible 
pairwise relative effects and to obtain a clinically meaningful rela-
tive ranking of the different dietary interventions. We present the 
summary mean differences with their 95% CI in a league table. 
The relative ranking of the different fats and oils for each out-
come were estimated using the distribution of the ranking prob-
abilities and the surface under the cumulative ranking curve 
(SUCRA) (16). The SUCRA ranges between 0% (i.e., the treat-
ment always ranks last) and 100% (i.e., the treatment always ranks 
first).
We fitted all analyses described in a frequentist framework 
 
using Stata (17) [network package (18)] and produced presenta-
tion tools with the network graphs package (19).
Assessment of inconsistency. To evaluate the presence of statisti-
cal inconsistency in the data (i.e., disagreement between the dif-
ferent sources of evidence), we employed both local and global 
approaches (20). Specifically, we used the loop-specific approach 
(21) to detect loops of evidence that might present important in-
consistency as well as the side-splitting approach (22) to detect 
comparisons for which direct estimates disagree with indirect 
 
evidence from the entire network. Global methods investigate the 
presence of inconsistency jointly from all possible sources in 
 
the entire network simultaneously. For this purpose, we used the 
design-by-treatment interaction model (23, 24).
Sensitivity analyses. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by in-
cluding low risk of bias trials: trials where oils/solid fats were pro-
vided by investigators only and trials including healthy participants.
Small study effects and publication bias. We produced the com-
parison-adjusted funnel plot (15) to assess the magnitude of fun-
nel plot asymmetry for all outcomes.
Credibility of the evidence
To make inferences about the credibility of evidence from the 
NMA, we used the GRADE system extended for NMA following 
the approach suggested by Salanti et al. (20) for all outcomes.
RESULTS
Out of 4,901 records identified by the literature search, 
241 full text articles were assessed in detail, as they reported 
on one or more of the types of oils/solid fats of interest in 
the title/abstract (supplemental Fig. S1).
Overall, 54 trials (55 reports) (25–79) with 2,065 partici-
pants published between 1984 and 2018 were included in 
the NMA.
The RCTs’ length ranged between 3 and 27 weeks; the 
mean age of the participants was between 22 and 84 years 
and their BMI between 20.2 and 31.1 kg/m2. Fourteen 
trials were conducted in North America, 2 trials in South 
America, 24 trials in Europe, 12 trials in Asia, and 1 trial in 
Australia and in Africa. Twenty-three trials were conducted 
in healthy participants; and in 50 trials, oils/solid fats were 
provided by investigators. Study and participant character-
istics as well as postintervention means and standard devia-
tions of the included trials according to study arms are 
summarized in supplemental Tables S1 and S2, respec-
tively. The fatty acid composition of the different oils/solid 
fats are given in supplemental Table S3.
Thirty-three trials (61%) were judged to be low risk of 
bias, 3 trials to be high risk of bias, and 18 trials were classi-
fied as moderate/unclear risk of bias studies, mainly due to 
insufficient information available within the included trials 
regarding random sequence generation, allocation con-
cealment, and blinding of participants/personnel and out-
come assessment. With regard to the single risk of bias 
items, 28% of the included studies indicated a low risk of 
bias for random-sequence generation, 7% for allocation 
concealment, and 39% for blinding of participants and 
personnel (supplemental Fig. S2).
Figure 2 shows the network diagrams for TC (Fig. 2A), 
LDL-C (Fig. 2B), HDL-C (Fig. 2C), and TG (Fig. 2D) of 
direct comparison with the number of studies reflected by 
the size of the edges, and the number of participants re-
flected by the size of the nodes. The highest number of 
trials compared a sunflower oil arm to a palm oil arm (n = 7).
Supplemental Tables S4–S7 show the percentage of 
 
statistical contribution coming from direct and indirect 
comparisons for each fat or oil compared with each other 
for TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG. It was shown that the con-
tribution to the study effects came more often from indi-
rect comparisons.
In general, there were some differences in the examined 
effect modifiers across comparisons for BMI, mean age, 
study length, and sample size. For several comparisons, we 
did not have enough studies and thus could not test transi-
tivity appropriately (supplemental Figs. S3–S6).
The summary effect estimates for the comparison of dif-
ferent oils/solid fats on LDL-C, TG, TC, and HDL-C are 
shown in Table 1 and Table 2.
Primary outcome
LDL-C. Each 10% of dietary energy from butter re-
placed with an equivalent amount of safflower, sunflower, 
rapeseed, flaxseed, corn, olive, soybean, palm, and coco-
nut oil, and beef fat was more effective in reducing LDL-C 
(0.42 to 0.23 mmol/l). Safflower, sunflower, rapeseed, 
corn, and soybean oil had a more pronounced effect on 
LDL-C when compared with lard (0.33 to 0.20 mmol/l). 
Moreover, sunflower oil was more effective in reducing 
LDL-C than olive and palm oil (0.10 to 0.09 mmol/l) 
(Fig. 3).
Secondary outcomes
TC. Likewise to LDL-C, each 10% of dietary energy 
from butter replaced with an equivalent amount of saf-
flower, sunflower, rapeseed, flaxseed, corn, olive, soybean, 
palm, and coconut oil, and beef fat was more effective in 
reducing TC (0.49 to 0.18 mmol/l). Safflower, sun-
flower, rapeseed, corn, and soybean oil were more potent 
to improve TC in comparison to lard (0.42 to 0.25

mmol/l). In addition, safflower, sunflower, rapeseed, and 
corn oil resulted in stronger decreases in TC when com-
pared with palm and coconut oil (0.31 to 0.13 mmol/l), 
while safflower, sunflower, and rapeseed oil were more 
 
effective in reducing TC compared with olive oil (0.21 
 
to 0.10 mmol/l).
HDL-C. Each 10% of dietary energy from safflower oil 
replaced with an equivalent amount of sunflower, olive, 
palm, and coconut oil increased HDL-C levels (0.06–0.09 
mmol/l). Sunflower and olive oil were more effective com-
pared with soybean oil (0.03–0.04 mmol/l). Beef fat was 
also more effective to improve HDL-C compared with saf-
flower and soybean oil (0.05–0.08 mmol/l). In addition, 
interventions with coconut or palm oil resulted in signifi-
cantly more elevated HDL-C values as compared with corn 
and soybean oil (0.04–0.06 mmol/l).
TGs. Each 10% of dietary energy from butter replaced 
with an equivalent amount of sunflower, soybean, and 
palm oil were more effective in reducing TGs (0.06 
 
to 0.04 mmol/l), while safflower, sunflower, corn, soybean, 
and palm oil were more powerful to reduce TGs when 
compared with beef fat (0.09 to 0.08 mmol/l), 
respectively.
SUCRA and rankings. Safflower oil had the highest SU-
CRA value for decreases in LDL-C (82%) and TC (90%), 
followed by rapeseed oil (76% for LDL-C, 85% for TC), 
and sunflower oil (71% for LDL-C, 72% for TC); whereas, 
palm oil (74%) had the highest SUCRA value for TG, fol-
lowed by soybean oil (72%) and safflower oil (68%). Re-
garding improvements in HDL-C, the following oils were 
ranked first, second, and third best: coconut oil (88%), 
palm oil (80%), and beef fat (74%), respectively (supple-
mental Tables S8–S11).
Inconsistency. The side-splitting approach suggested sig-
nificant inconsistency for TC in the comparisons of saf-
flower oil versus flaxseed oil, for LDL-C in the comparisons 
of soybean oil versus corn and palm oil, and between butter 
and olive oil, and for HDL-C when comparing sunflower 
oil versus flaxseed oil and comparing soybean oil versus 
corn and palm oil. For all other comparisons, no significant

participants allocated to the intervention and the thickness of the lines is proportional to the number of studies evaluating each direct

inconsistency was observed in the side-splitting approach 
(supplemental Tables S12–S15). The loop-specific ap-
proach showed some important inconsistency in the loops 
formed by olive, safflower, and flaxseed oil, and beef fat for 
TC, as well as the loops formed by safflower, flaxseed, and 
corn oil, and beef fat for TC and LDL-C, and the loops 
formed by soybean, corn, and coconut oil, and beef fat for 
LDL-C. For HDL-C, inconsistency was observed for the

loop formed by safflower, flaxseed, corn, and coconut oil 
(supplemental Figs. S7–S10). The design-by-treatment 
model showed no significant inconsistency for TC (P = 0.77), 
LDL-C (P = 0.88), HDL-C (P = 0.43), and TG (P = 0.99).
Sensitivity analysis. In the sensitivity analyses including 
only low risk of bias trials (n = 33), trials where oils/solid fats 
were provided by investigators (n = 50), and trials with healthy 
participants (n = 23), the results of the primary analysis could 
be confirmed (supplemental Tables S16–S27). Due to missing 
comparisons, we were not able to conduct NMA sensitivity 
analyses in at-risk participants and the types of underlying 
diet (provided by investigators vs. simply advised).
Small study effects. The comparison-adjusted funnel plots 
for all outcomes appear slightly and/or moderately asym-
metric (supplemental Figs. S11–S14).
Quality of evidence. The quality of evidence for TC was 
rated moderate for most of the comparisons summing up 
mixed evidence (direct and indirect evidence); whereas for 
indirect evidence comparisons, the credibility of evidence 
was mainly rated low (supplemental Table S28). The quality 
of evidence for LDL-C was rated low or moderate for most 
of the comparisons summing up mixed evidence; whereas 
for indirect evidence comparisons, the credibility of evi-
dence was mainly rated low or very low (supplemental 
 
Table S29). The credibility of evidence for HDL-C was 
mainly judged as moderate (supplemental Table S30). The 
quality of evidence for TG was rated moderate or high for 
most of the comparisons summing up mixed evidence; 
whereas for indirect evidence comparisons, the credibility 
of evidence was mainly rated moderate (supplemental 
Table S31). Low quality of evidence judgments were mainly 
driven by the low number of trials, unclear risk of bias, 
imprecision, and inconsistency for several comparisons.
DISCUSSION
This NMA synthesized the direct and indirect evidence 
on the effects of 13 oils and solid fats (safflower, sunflower, 
rapeseed, hempseed, flaxseed, corn, olive, soybean, palm, 
and coconut oil, and beef fat, lard, and butter) on blood 
lipids (TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG).
In summary, safflower oil showed the highest SUCRA 
value for reduction in TC and LDL-C followed by rapeseed 
oil and sunflower oil; soybean oil was the most effective oil 
to reduce TG, followed by corn oil and palm oil; butter and 
lard were ranked worst for TC and LDL-C reduction; coco-
nut oil was ranked best to improve HDL-C, followed by 
palm oil and beef fat. The NMA showed that all vegetable 
oils were more effective in reducing TC (0.49 to 0.18 
mmol/l) and LDL-C (0.42 to 0.23 mmol/l) compared 
with butter. Most of the comparisons derived from mixed 
evidence were rated as moderate quality of evidence.
Comparison with other studies
In line with findings from the present NMA, pairwise 
meta-analyses of intervention trials have shown that n-3- and 
n-6-rich oils were more effective in reducing TC and LDL-C 
compared with olive oil (8). Similar to our findings, in a 
meta-analysis of 28 studies, flaxseed oil was not more ef-
fective in reducing TC or LDL-C compared with different 
vegetable oils (olive, rapeseed, hempseed, safflower, or 
sunflower oil) (80). Findings from another meta-analysis 
showed that palm oil significantly increased TC by 0.35 
mmol/l and LDL-C by 0.24 mmol/l compared with vegeta-
ble oils low in SFAs (9). In line with our findings, palm oil 
(ranked second best for HDL-C) was more effective to im-
prove HDL-C compared with vegetable oils low in SFAs (9). 
Comparing palm oil with either MUFA- or PUFA-rich oils 
resulted in higher levels of LDL-C (by approximately 0.20–
0.30 mmol/l) and increased levels of HDL-C (by 0.05 
mmol/l) (81). Another comprehensive meta-analysis of 60 
feeding trials showed that particular replacement of mixed 
fat constituting 10% of energy by rapeseed, soybean, or 
 
olive oil resulted in reductions of the TC:HDL-C ratio that 
were significantly more pronounced than the correspond-
ing changes following replacement by butter (10).
Focusing on hard clinical endpoints, in prospective 
 
observational studies, dietary linoleic acid intake was in-
versely associated with CHD risk in a dose-response manner 
(82); whereas, evidence from a meta-analysis of observa-
tional studies suggested an inverse association comparing 
the top versus bottom third of olive oil intake and risk of 
CVD (83). Interestingly, a dose-response meta-analysis of 15 
cohort studies observed a neutral association between one 
daily tablespoon (14 g/day) of butter and risk of CVD (84).
In addition to these epidemiological data, a number of 
intervention trials investigated the effects of variations in 
fat content/fat quality on cardiovascular risk. A beneficial 
effect of PUFA-rich vegetable oils was observed in men who 
already had a heart attack during the 5 year randomized 
Oslo Diet-Heart Study (85). The approach of the Women’s 
Health Initiative trial was a general replacement of dietary 
fat by carbohydrates. Incidence rates of both CHD and 
CVD were equally pronounced in low fat (20% fat) and 
control groups after the 5 year intervention as well as the 8 
year follow-up period (86). The Lyon Heart Study recruited 
605 men who had suffered from acute myocardial in-
farction. These patients were subjected to either a Medi-
terranean diet (MedD), including a rapeseed oil-based 
margarine, or a control diet. The MedD turned out to be 
protective with respect to cardiovascular mortality as well as 
nonfatal myocardial infarction (87). The PREDIMED (Pre-
vencion con Dieta Mediterranea) trial investigated a MedD 
with an additional provision of either extra-virgin olive oil 
(50 g/day) or tree nuts (30 g/day). The incidence of com-
bined cardiovascular events was lower among those as-
signed to a MedD supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil 
or nuts than among those assigned to a lower-fat diet (88).
Possible explanations
With respect to potential mechanisms of action, the gen-
eral cholesterol-lowering effects predominantly exerted by 
vegetable oils in the present study might be due to their 
fatty acid composition, specifically the contents of n-3 and 
n-6 PUFAs or MUFAs. In this regard, the findings of the

present NMA are in line with the predictive equations of 
Mensink and colleagues based on fatty acid composition of 
the fats and oils (10, 89). Synthesizing data of 84 controlled 
trials in a meta-analysis, the authors observed a strong re-
duction of LDL-C, TC, and the TC:HDL-C ratio, as well as 
apolipoprotein B, when carbohydrates constituting 1% of 
energy were replaced in an isocaloric fashion by PUFAs 
and MUFAs, respectively. LDL-C predicted equations 
showed that each 10% of dietary energy from butter re-
placed by unsaturated fatty rich oils (0.31 to 0.22 
mmol/l) were in line with findings from the NMA (0.42 
to 0.20 mmol/l). Moreover, SFAs (higher in coconut oil 
or butter) raised HDL-C more than MUFA- or PUFA-rich 
oils (0.02–0.03 mmol/l), and MUFA resulted in slightly 
higher HDL than PUFA, suggesting that our findings con-
firm the knowledge based on fatty acid composition. In 
contrast to these benefits, lauric acid, myristic acid, and 
palmitic acid were shown to increase plasma levels of TC 
and LDL-C in the meta-regression analysis by Mensink (89).
Regarding hard clinical endpoints, the role of specific 
types of fatty acids is discussed controversially. Increasing 
consumption of PUFAs in place of SFAs resulted in a re-
duction in CHD in a meta-analysis of intervention trials by 
Mozaffarian, Micha, and Wallace (5). However, contradict-
ing results have been reported by Ramsden et al. (6), ob-
serving that replacement of SFAs by linoleic acid did not 
affect CHD mortality. In addition, a multivariable meta- 
regression analysis comparing MUFAs, PUFAs, and SFAs 
showed no significant effects on CVD risk (90). Despite sev-
eral analyses with deviating results, there is overall consen-
sus that replacement of (foods rich in) SFAs by (foods rich 
in) unsaturated fatty acids lowers the risk of CHD (91).
LDL-C is an established risk factor for the development 
of CVD. For instance, a meta-analysis of 26 trials reported 
that every 1 mmol/l reduction in LDL-C plasma levels was 
associated with a corresponding 20% risk reduction in 
CHD mortality (92). Thus, the significantly more pro-
nounced decrease in LDL-C following intake of vegetable 
oils as compared with butter demonstrated in the present 
systematic review seems to be important in regard to the 
prevention of cardiovascular events. Concerning HDL-C, 
the evidence is not clear. Epidemiological studies provide 
evidence for an inverse association between plasma levels 
of HDL-C and risk of CVD (93). However, Mendelian ran-
domization studies showed that genetically decreased 
HDL-C was not associated with an increased risk of myo-
cardial infarction, thereby calling into question a causal 
association between HDL-C and CVD (94). Against this 
background, effects of diet on HDL-C concentrations 
should be interpreted with caution. Still, as a marker of 
cardiovascular health, changes in HDL-C concentrations 
need to be included when discussing the effect of oils/solid 
fats in the diet.
Strength and limitations
Our systematic review and meta-analysis has several 
strengths and limitations that need to be addressed. 
Among the strengths are the application of the NMA meth-
odology, the high number of included studies on oils/solid 
fats (n = 54 trials), the inclusion of 13 different oils/solid 
fats, the inclusion of four outcomes (TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, 
and TG), the a priori published protocol, the risk of bias 
assessment, inconsistency testing, transitivity analyses, sen-
sitivity analyses, and the quality of evidence judgment.
However, several limitations should also be considered 
when interpreting the findings of the present NMA. First, 
most of the evidence came from indirect comparisons, 
showing important heterogeneity and inconsistency, and 
wide 95% CIs (imprecision) for several comparisons. The 
similarity across the included trials was only modest (age of 
participants, BMI, country), and this could be an impor-
tant factor for the observed inconsistency for some com-
parisons. Moreover, only 33 out of 54 trials were rated with 
a low risk of bias. In accordance with this, the credibility of 
evidence was rated mainly low for comparisons deriving 
from indirect evidence and moderate for mixed evidence 
comparisons. This implicates that further research will pro-
vide important evidence on the confidence and likely 
change the effect estimate. However, sensitivity analyses, i) 
including low risk of bias trials, ii) excluding high-risk par-
ticipants, or iii) excluding trials where the oils/solid fats 
were not provided by investigators, confirmed the findings 
of the main analysis. Second, the present NMA takes only 
intermediate biomarkers for CVD risk into account, and, 
as shown for HDL-C, a causal link should be interpreted 
cautiously.
CONCLUSIONS
Unsaturated fatty rich oils like safflower, sunflower, rape-
seed, flaxseed, corn, olive, soybean, palm, and coconut oil 
were more effective in reducing LDL-C (0.42 to 0.20 
mmol/l) as compared with SFA-rich food like butter or 
lard. LDL-C predicted differences based on their fatty acid 
composition showed that each 10% of dietary energy from 
butter replaced by unsaturated fatty rich oils (0.31 to -0.22 
mmol/l) were in line with findings from the NMA. Despite 
the limitations of the NMA approach and the overall low 
quality of evidence judgements, the NMA findings are in 
line with existing evidence on the metabolic effects of fat, 
and support current recommendations to replace high 
saturated-fat food with unsaturated oils.
