Abstract 
Background: In early breast cancer (EBC), the adjuvant use of bisphosphonates reduces the incidence of bone 
metastases but only appears to improve overall recurrence and survival in postmenopausal patients. The 
mechanisms underlying these observations remain unclear. To address this, we tested the recently identified 
bone relapse biomarker, MAF gene gain (MAF+) in primary tumours from women included in the AZURE trial 
(ISRCTN79831382) to determine the prognostic value of MAF and its potential to predict the effects of 
adjuvant zoledronic acid (ZOL) on disease outcomes. 
Methods: The AZURE trial is an academic, prospective, open label, randomised phase III multicentre, parallel-
group trial, performed in 3360 women with stage II/III breast cancer to receive standard adjuvant systemic 
therapy alone or with ZOL every 3-4 weeks for 6 doses, then 3-6 monthly thereafter to complete 5 years 
treatment. Consenting patients were randomised on a 1:1 basis using a central automated 24-hour computer-
generated telephone randomisation system that included a minimisation process that took into account the 
number of involved axillary lymph nodes, clinical tumour stage, oestrogen receptor status, type and timing of 
systemic therapy, menopausal status, statin use and treating centre. The primary endpoint was disease 
recurrence. MAF was detected in breast tumours in tissue microarray format using a validated (MAF/D16Z3) 
FISH test, MAFTEST (Inbiomotion, Spain) in a blinded fashion by a central laboratory (Targos, Germany). A 
copy number cut-off ≥2.5 was preset to define a MAF+ve tumour.  Multivariate analyses of disease outcomes 
by MAF status were performed in control and ZOL patients separately on an intention to treat basis according 
to a pre-specified analysis plan. Interactions between MAF+ve and menopausal status on effects of ZOL were 
also evaluated. 
Findings: Of the 1769 AZURE patients who donated primary tumour samples, 865 (49%) had 2 FISH 
evaluable cores of which 184 (21%) were MAF+ve. MAF+ve tumours were more likely to be of higher grade, 
ER-ve and Her2+. At a median follow-up of 84 months, MAF was not prognostic in control patients for 
invasive disease free (IDFS) or overall (OS) survival, but in ZOL treated patients those with a MAF-ve tumor 
had better IDFS (HRIDFS=0.52 [0.36-0.75] and OS (HROS=0.48 [0.31-0.75]). In patients with MAF-ve tumours, 
ZOL was associated with improved IDFS (HRIDFS=0.74 [0.56-0.98]). However in patients with MAF+ve 
tumours, ZOL did not improve disease outcomes and, in the 119 MAF+ve patients who were not 
postmenopausal at randomisation, ZOL was associated with much worse outcomes (HRIDFS=2.47 [1.23-4.97] 
and HROS=2.27 [1.04-4.93]). The interactions between disease outcomes, ZOL use and menopausal status were 
driven largely by an excess of extraskeletal recurrences (E-IDFS) in women with MAF+ve tumours who 
initiated ZOL before the development of menopause (HRE-IDFS=6.92, [2.44-19.6]).  
Interpretation: FISH evaluation of MAF in EBC segregates patients likely to benefit from adjuvant ZOL 
(MAF-ve) from those who may be harmed (not postmenopausal MAF+ve) and merits further investigation as a 
potential companion diagnostic.

measurements and statistical analyses were funded by Inbiomotion (Barcelona, Spain).

Introduction 
Meta-analysis of clinical trials has shown that adjuvant bisphosphonates (especially zoledronic acid [ZOL] or 
clodronate) reduce bone metastases and improve survival in postmenopausal patients with early breast cancer1. 
The AZURE study of adjuvant zoledronic acid in early breast cancer was the first study to identify the benefits 
of adjuvant bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women2 and prompted the confirmatory meta-analysis of this 
subgroup finding,1 In addition, marked heterogeneity according to menopausal status in the rates of recurrence 
outside bone was seen, with an increase in extraskeletal metastases in women who were not postmenopausal at 
study entry. However, despite recapitulation of these clinical observations in preclinical animal models of bone 
metastases3, the biological mechanisms underpinning these apparent interactions between treatment effects and 
menopausal status are unknown.  
There are many clinical, pathologic and molecular biomarkers that have been used to assess prognosis in early 
breast cancer although none, with the possible exception of estrogen receptor status, are useful to specifically 
identify patients at high risk for bone metastases. Gene profiles that may specifically predict for bone 
recurrence4 were first described a decade ago but none are currently used in clinical practice. In terms of 
predicting treatment benefits, menopausal status (and by association age) are recommended in clinical practice 
guidelines for selection of patients likely to benefit from adjuvant bisphosphonate5,6. However, the imprecise 
definition and timing of menopause, makes this a somewhat difficult criterion on which to select patients most 
likely to benefit. Recently, using a proteomic discovery platform, the co-expression of GIPC1 and CAPG 
proteins by primary tumours was shown to predict benefit from adjuvant ZOL in early breast cancer.7 However, 
to date, there are no confirmatory datasets supporting the clinical application of this discovery and the 
reproducibility of these analyses awaits confirmation. Thus, there is currently no biomarker to select patients 
for treatment with adjuvant ZOL. 
To address this, the recently identified early breast cancer bone relapse biomarker, MAF gene gain (MAF+)8 
was tested retrospectively in the large prospectively randomized AZURE trial2,9, of standard adjuvant therapy 
+/- ZOL in high risk early breast cancer. Overexpression of MAF, a transcription factor of the AP-1 family and 
encoded within the 16q arm, supports the molecular processes that affect the metastatic course from the 
primary site to distal colonization8. MAF regulates the expression of a set of genes that collectively support 
several steps of breast cancer cell metastasis through a series of cell-autonomous and niche-related functions8. 
Collectively, these observations suggest that MAF accumulation (MAF gain) may enable the identification of 
patients at high risk of metastasis. In this report, we have determined the prognostic value of MAF and its 
potential to predict the effects of ZOL on disease outcomes. 
Methods 
Study Design and patients 
3360 patients from 174 centres were recruited between September 2003 and March 2006 to the AZURE study.  
Eligibility criteria have been reported previously2,9 but, in summary, patients had to have histologically 
confirmed invasive breast cancer of any subtype with either pathologically involved axillary lymph node 
metastasis or a T3/T4 primary tumour treated with curative intent. Prior complete resection of the primary 
tumour was necessary or had to be planned if patients were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients 
had to be age ≥18 with a Karnofsky performance status index ≥80 and neither pregnant or breast-feeding to be 
eligible. Patients were not eligible if there was clinical or imaging evidence of distant metastases prior to study 
entry, current or recent (previous year) use of bisphosphonates or pre-existing bone disease likely to require 
bone-targeted treatment.  
All patients gave written informed consent and, in the United Kingdom only, additional specific consent to use 
of biological materials (primary tumour and blood samples was requested. Patients could participate in the main 
trial alone if they so chose. Prior to randomisation, haematological, renal and hepatic function tests were 
required. Staging imaging tests were performed in accordance with institutional protocols.  The full protocol 
may be viewed at http://ctru.leeds.ac.uk/Azure 
The outcome data for the AZURE study have been previously reported2,9 and the planned final analysis data-
lock2 was used for the analyses described below.  
Procedures 
Eligible patients were randomized to receive (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy +/- ZOL 
4mg iv every 3-4 weeks for 6 doses, then 3 monthly x 8 and 6 monthly x 5 to complete 5 years treatment. 
Calcium and vitamin D oral supplements were recommended for all trial subjects during the first six months on 
study, and continued thereafter at the discretion of the treating physician. Both the use of adjuvant systemic 
  
4 
treatments and loco-regional radiotherapy were given in accordance with standard protocols at each 
participating institution. 
The follow-up schedule was similar in both arms of the study and included clinical assessment, adverse event 
monitoring and haematological, renal and hepatic function test measurements. Routine follow-up imaging was 
not mandated, with investigations for possible recurrence clinically directed as deemed appropriate by the 
treating physician. The date of recurrence was defined as the date on which relapse was first suspected, to 
reduce the risk of ascertainment bias.  91% of recurrences were independently validated by either on-site or 
telephone-based monitoring. Subjects were followed up on an annual basis after completion of the 5-year 
treatment phase (ZOL or control) for both disease and relevant safety endpoints.  
Of the 3360 patients accrued in the trial, primary tumour tissue blocks were collected from 1769/2710 (65%) 
patients treated at participating sites in the UK. Site participation in the collection of tumour blocks was 
encouraged but not mandatory and, for logistical reasons, restricted to UK sites.  
All tumour blocks were sent to Sheffield for tissue microarray (TMA) construction where the location of 
invasive tumour within the tissue blocks was indicated by a single breast pathologist as a guide to the 
technician extracting the tissue cores for construction of the TMAs. Quadruplicate cores of 1 mm in diameter of 
each of the tumour tissue sample were arranged in 4 sets of 13 TMAs (150 samples each). All analyses are 
restricted to study participants who gave specific patient consent for the use of tissue samples. 
The MAF biomarker analysis was completed on TMAs from primary tumours. Sample handling, methodology, 
scoring and statistical analyses were pre-specified in a study charter and statistical analysis plan. 5 μm thick 
tissue sections were cut from each TMA block, orientated to ensure correlation with the TMA map to allow 
identification of each tissue core and mounted onto Superfrost plus glass slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific).  
TMA slices were first analyzed using haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining to determine the presence of 
evaluable tumour. MAF amplification was then assessed using a validated (MAF/D16Z3) FISH test, 
MAFTEST, (Inbiomotion, Barcelona, Spain).  A central laboratory (Targos Molecular Pathology, Kassel, 
Germany) validated the assay for analytic and diagnostic performance, established acceptance criteria, included 
appropriate quality controls for each assay, and performed the analyses in a blinded fashion. The previously 
described immunohistochemical (IHC) test for MAF8 was found to perform sub-optimally on the TMA samples 
available, presumably due to epitope decay in the >10 years since fixation and is not considered further in this 
report.   
Briefly, TMA sections were deparaffinated in Xylene (2x for 10 min), rehydrated in ethanol series, washed 
with water and pretreated at 98ºC for 15 min. Samples were digested with pepsin (Poseidon Tissue Digestion 
Kit, Kreatech, Amsterdam, Netherlands) for 30 min, dehydrated in ethanol series and dried. After adding 10 μl 
of MAF/D16Z3 probe (Inbiomotion), slides were denatured at 80ºC and placed overnight in a hybridizer at 
37ºC. After hybridization, FISH slides were washed in Wash Buffer I at 72ºC for 2 min and then Wash Buffer 
II (both Poseidon Tissue Digestion Kit, Kreatech) for 1 min at room temperature. After dehydration and air-
drying, slides were incubated with 15 μl of DAPI solution (0.03 mg/ml) and stored at 4ºC in the dark until 
scoring. 
Mean MAF copy number per nuclei was scored by blinded central laboratory personnel in 20 nuclei from 
regions of the tumour with the highest amplification. If MAF mean copy number was between 2.0 and 3.0, an 
additional 30 nuclei were scored. Replica cores were scored until 2 FISH amplification values were obtained 
for each tumour. The highest value of MAF amplification in 2 evaluable samples of a patient was chosen for 
statistical analysis. The tumours on TMAs were FISH analysed only once, with no optimization and no 
repetitions allowed by protocol. A patient was considered as positive for MAF amplification when at least one 
of the replicas had a mean number of MAF copies per nuclei equal or higher than 2.5. The copy number cut-off 
≥2.5 was predefined for MAF positivity (MAF+ve) based on studies in a retrospective cohort8 and set at a level 
that was unlikely to be artificially influenced by rapid proliferation. 
Statistical analysis 
Following eligibility confirmation, patients were randomised by the treating clinical team on a 1:1 basis, using 
a central automated 24-hour computer-generated telephone minimisation system to ensure the concealment of 
the next treatment assignment based at the Clinical Trials Research Unit (CTRU), University of Leeds, to either 
standard adjuvant therapy alone (control) or with zoledronic acid monohydrate (ZOL), Novartis 
Pharmaceuticals, Summit, New Jersey, USA. To reduce possible imbalances in tumour and treatment 
characteristics, a minimisation process was used that took into account the number of involved axillary lymph 
nodes, clinical tumour stage, oestrogen receptor status, type and timing of systemic therapy, menopausal status, 
statin use and treating centre.  
  
5 
The primary endpoint of the AZURE trial was disease free survival (DFS), defined as distant recurrence, any 
invasive loco-regional recurrence except for ipsilateral operable relapse within a conserved breast, and death 
without recurrence. As described more fully in previous reports,2,9 invasive DFS (IDFS) was added as a key 
secondary endpoint to reflect the international standard definition for recurrence that had emerged since the 
trial began10 and is the primary disease endpoint assessed in this report. Secondary endpoints included overall 
survival (OS) defined as death from any cause after randomisation, time to bone metastases and subgroup 
analyses based on variables included in the randomisation including menopausal status. This study is registered 
as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN79831382 
For this report, our hypothesis was that MAF status would have potential value as a prognostic factor for 
disease recurrence, especially in bone and as a predictive factor for response to adjuvant ZOL. The 
relationships in the control group were specified as the primary endpoint with those in the ZOL group 
exploratory. IDFS, OS, time to first IDFS event in bone (as first event or at any time) and time to first IDFS 
event not in bone endpoints, all defined as in the main study,2,9 were assessed on all patients in the AZURE 
safety population with an evaluable MAFTEST. Subsequently, because disease outcomes by menopausal status 
had been pre-specified analyses in the AZURE protocol and reported in the main study reports,2,9 interactions 
between MAF+ve and effects of ZOL on disease outcomes by menopausal status were also pre-specified in the 
statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
The SAP was defined before any data analysis was performed. All statistical analyses were performed at the 
Clinical Trials Research Unit, University of Leeds where the AZURE clinical trial database is held on behalf of 
the trial sponsor, the University of Sheffield. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS statistical 
software version 9.4. The SAP may be found in appendix p2-4. 
The prognostic value of MAF status for IDFS and OS were investigated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, 
whilst the time to first IDFS event in bone endpoint was assessed using a cumulative incidence function curve 
utilising a Fine and Gray approach. Differences in outcomes between patients with MAF+ve or MAF-ve 
tumours were compared using multivariable modelling in control patients only (Cox’s proportional hazards) to 
adjust for the AZURE minimisation factors described above (excluding treating centre). Hypothesis testing was 
two-sided at a 5% significance level. No adjustments have been made for multiplicity.  
For the predictive analyses, the response to zoledronic acid treatment was tested comparing control and ZOL 
groups. A predictive analysis, assessing the interaction of MAF status with treatment allocation, was performed 
using a Cox proportional hazards model. Only minimization factors identified as statistically significant in the 
prognostic analysis were included in the model to reduce potential overfitting. In addition, predictive analyses 
were carried out for patients who were unequivocally post-menopausal (>5 years since last menses) at trial 
entry separately to patients who were not post-menopausal (pre-menopausal, ≤5 years since menopause and 
menopausal status unknown), given the significant heterogeneity of treatment effect between established post-
menopausal patients and all other patients observed in the AZURE trial as a whole9.  
Additional exploratory analyses were conducted for IDFS in all patients using a Cox proportional hazards 
model including the prognostic factors specified for the predictive analysis. The model included a three-way 
interaction term between MAF, menopausal status and treatment. Sensitivity analyses were conducted 
including all prognostic factors as specified in the prognostic analysis for this model. Because of the 
complexity of defining menopause and in recognition that it is a biological process that occurs over years, the 
model was also fit with age as a surrogate for the menopausal status term; with an arbitrary cut-point of ≥ or 
<50 at randomization. 
 
Role of the Funding Source 
The AZURE trial was sponsored by the University of Sheffield and academic grant support provided by 
Novartis, supplemented by the infrastructure of the National Cancer Research Network. Novartis funded the 
sample collection but had no input in the study design, analysis or interpretation of data, nor in writing of the 
report. Inbiomotion had no involvement in the AZURE study design, or data analysis but JJM and JT did 
provide input into the statistical analysis plan, commented on the interpretation of the data and reviewed and 
approved the manuscript as co-authors. Biomarker measurements and statistical analyses were funded by 
Inbiomotion. The corresponding author had full access to all of the data and the final responsibility for 
publication. 
Results 
The primary tumours from 1739 patients had been processed between August 2003 and February 2006 
according to routine local laboratory standard operating procedures and the TMAs prepared in 2007 and 2008 
from representative tumour blocks sent to the University of Sheffield. Sections from the TMAs were sent to the 
  
6 
independent laboratory (TARGOS) for all analyses. Despite marking of the tumour blocks by an experienced 
pathologist before TMA construction, only 3978 out of 6326 TMA cores (63%) had sufficient invasive tumour 
confirmed on an H&E stained slide within each individual core for FISH analysis . The MAFTEST FISH assay 
was performed on adjacent sections and could be reliably assessed according to the stringent quality standards 
of the independent laboratory (TARGOS) in 2067 of 3978 (56%) tissues cores with sufficient invasive tumour. 
To reduce the impact of tumour heterogeneity in such small fragments of the original tumour, duplicate 
evaluable results from each patient were mandated. 865 of 1739 patients (50%) providing primary tumour for 
assessment had 2 evaluable FISH results and of these, 184 of 865 patients (21%) had a MAF+ve tumour.  
The median follow-up was 84.6 (IQR 72.0-95.8) months. 282 patients in this biomarker subset had experienced 
an IDFS event (147 control, 135 ZOL), 60 a first IDFS event in bone (39 control, 21 ZOL) and 193 an OS 
event (102 control, 91 ZOL). The proportions of MAFTEST analyzed patients with an IDFS or OS event were 
similar to the main study; 5 year IDFS probabilities for the ZOL and control arms respectively in this biomarker 
population were 74.1% (95%CI 69.8-78.3) and 73.7% (95%CI 69.6-77.8) compared with 75.1% (95%CI 73.0-
77.2) and 73.9% (95%CI 71.7-76.0) in the overall study population.  
Patient characteristics in those patients with TMA cores evaluable for MAF gain were similar to the entire 
cohort of patients included in AZURE (Table 1). More patients with MAF+ve tumours had high grade, ER 
negative and HER2 positive tumours than did those with MAF-ve tumours (Table 2). As a result of these 
factors, patients with MAF+ve tumours were more likely to have received taxanes and trastuzumab and less 
likely to require endocrine treatments than for the whole group. The frequency of MAF+ve tumours was similar 
across menopausal subsets and age. Given the heterogeneity of the prognostic factors in the baseline 
demographics, results are reported using the multivariable Cox modelling.  
Pre-specified analyses 
Relationships between MAF status and prognosis  
In the control patient group, 118 of 360 MAF-ve (33%) and 29 of 85 MAF+ (34%) experienced an IDFS event 
and MAF was not prognostic for IDFS (HR:0.92, 95%CI 0.59-1.41) However, this result is not fully 
representative of the data as the impact of MAF status on disease outcome was found to be significantly 
influenced by menopausal status at randomization, test for interaction (TFI) IDFS by menopause, Chi2=7.34, 
P=0.009 (Figure 1). In postmenopausal women, the hazard ratio for IDFS (HRIDFS) for MAF-ve/MAF+ve was 
0.47 [95%CI 0.25-0.88], suggesting MAF is indeed prognostic for IDFS in this group of patients. However, in 
contrast, for non-postmenopausal women, the HRIDFS for MAF-ve/MAF+ve was 1.58 [95%CI 0.82-3.03]. 
Lymph node involvement, tumour stage, ER status and histological grade were found to be significant in the 
prognostic analysis and are included in the predictive analysis modelling. 
In ZOL patients, MAF provided prognostic information, with worse IDFS in MAF+ve tumors (Figure 1). 
(HRIDFS for MAF-ve/MAF+ve = 0.52 [95%CI 0.36-0.75] and HROS for MAF-ve/MAF+ve =0.48 [95%CI 0.31-
0.75] (figure Appendix page 1). 
There were insufficient bone events (13 bone only and 6 bone with other sites in MAF+ve, 47 bone only and 26 
bone with other sites in MAF-ve) in this sample set to reliably assess the relationships between MAF status and 
relapse in bone.  
Relationships between MAF status and treatment effects 
There was an IDFS MAF/treatment interaction for patients overall χ2=4.55, p=0.03; this result however is 
convoluted by the interaction between menopausal status and MAF found in the prognostic analysis above. In 
subgroup analyses for IDFS there was a MAF/treatment interaction for non-postmenopausal patients (χ2=9.23, 
p=0.002), but not for postmenopausal patients (χ2=0.09, p=0.76).   
In patients with MAF-ve tumours, treatment with ZOL was associated with improved IDFS compared to 
control patients (HRIDFS ZOL/CONTROL=0.74 95%CI 0.56-0.98) (Figure 2). The group sizes, number of 
events and hazard ratios for the pre-planned menopausal sub-group and exploratory age analyses are shown in 
Figure 3. Treatment benefits with ZOL compared to control were similar irrespective of menopausal status or 
age.  
In patients with MAF+ve tumours the findings are more complex (Figure 3). Overall, zoledronic acid did not 
appear to improve IDFS (HRIDFS ZOL/CONTROL=1.34 [95%CI 0.83-2.14]). There was, however, significant 
heterogeneity of the treatment effect by menopause (hypothesis test reported in additional analyses). In women 
who were not postmenopausal at the start of treatment, there were clear adverse effects on IDFS (HRIDFS 
ZOL/CONTROL=2.47 [95% CI 1.23-4.97]).  In postmenopausal women, there were insufficient events, from 
the subset of MAF+ve tumours ( HRIDFS ZOL/CONTROL for MAF+ve postmenopausal women=0.74 [95%CI 
  
7 
0.35-1.58]) to establish a definitive relationship between MAF status and treatment effect, although the point 
estimate for the hazard ratio (albeit with wider confidence intervals) was similar to that seen in MAF –ve 
women. 
For OS, a similar relationship between treatment, menopause and MAF was seen.  There were fewer deaths in 
patients with MAF-ve tumours treated with ZOL (ZOL 57 events in 321 [18%] patients; CONTROL 76 events 
in 360 patients [21%];  (HROS ZOL/CONTROL=0.78 [95%CI 0.55-1.10]). In patients with MAF+ve tumours, 
no effect of ZOL on OS was seen  (ZOL 34 events in 99 [34%] patients; CONTROL 26 events in 85 patients 
[31%]; HROS ZOL/CONTROL=1.11 [95%CI 0.66-1.86]). However there is a clear adverse effect of ZOL in 
non-postmenopausal women with MAF+ve tumours (ZOL 24 events in 66 [36%] patients; CONTROL 9 events 
in 55 patients [16%]; HROS ZOL/CONTROL=4.64 [95%CI 1.33-16.25]) compared with a numerical beneficial 
treatment effect on OS ((ZOL 10 events in 33 [30%] patients; CONTROL 17 events in 30 patients [57%]; HROS 
ZOL/CONTROL=0.62 [95%CI 0.27-1.48]) in postmenopausal women with MAF+ve tumours.  
In 190 patients with an IDFS event, this was at an extraskeletal site (92 control, 98 ZOL). When compared with 
the control group, treatment with ZOL in non-postmenopausal women with MAF+ve tumours was associated 
with a marked increase in relapse (Figure 4) at extraskeletal sites. The extraskeletal IDFS estimates at 60 
months for MAF +ve tumors were 5.7% 95%CI 1.5-14.2%) for control patients and 38.8% (95%CI 27.1-
50.3%) for ZOL patients, (HRIDFS ZOL/CONTROL =6.92, 95%CI 2.44-19.6). ZOL had no effect on 
extraskeletal recurrences in non-postmenopausal patients with MAF-ve tumors; the extraskeletal IDFS 
estimates at 60 months for MAF -ve tumors were 18% 95%CI 13.5-23.1%) for control patients and 19.8% 
(95%CI 14.8-25.5%) for ZOL patients (HRIDFS ZOL/CONTROL=0.81, 95%CI 0.57-1.13).  
Additional exploratory analyses 
The menopausal subgroup analyses indicated that menopausal status at randomization was playing a role in 
how MAF influences IDFS disease outcomes. The cox model specified for the predictive analyses did not 
include any parameters for menopausal status; an exploratory Cox model was fitted to better understand any 
potential interactions. The likelihood ratio test for the three-way interaction term between MAF, menopausal 
status and treatment yields a χ 2 of 5.71 (P=0.017, 1DF), The model allows a hypothesis test for heterogeneity 
of the treatment effect by menopause for MAF subgroups; Wald heterogeneity Chi square statistics: 6.98 
(P=0.008, 1DF) and 0.38 (P=0.539, 1DF) for MAF+ve and MAF-ve patients respectively. 
Hazard Ratios (with 95%CIs) are presented using non-postmenopausal control patients with MAF-ve tumours 
as the reference group (Table 3). The individual hazard ratios are consistent with the prescribed analysis that 
IDFS outcome is independent of menopausal status when patients are treated with ZOL. There is however 
heterogeneity in IDFS outcomes by menopausal status in addition to MAF status in control patients. MAF+ve 
postmenopausal control patients have significantly worse IDFS outcome in contrast to MAF+ve non-
postmenopausal patients (HR non-post/post: 0.26, 95%CI 0.12-0.56). Interestingly non-postmenopausal 
patients with MAF+ tumours appear to have a better IDFS than do those that are MAF-ve (HR MAF+ve/MAF-
ve: 0.63, 95%CI 0.33-1.20).  
The exploratory model was fit using age as a surrogate for menopausal status, with an arbitrary cut-point of ≥ 
or <50 at randomization (Table 4). There is no difference in the interpretation of the results in IDFS when using 
age as a surrogate marker for menopause with a similar beneficial effect for ZOL in patients with MAF-ve 
tumours (Figure 3). Sensitivity analyses for the exploratory Cox model including all AZURE minimization 
factors were conducted and made no interpretable difference to the estimates (data not shown). 
Discussion 
Using an independent specialist biomarker laboratory and a pre-defined cut-off, blinded to patient 
demographic, treatment and outcome data, we have shown that tumour copy number of the MAF transcription 
factor encoded by MAF gene with a precisely developed MAF/D16Z3 FISH test performed on archival primary 
breast tumours in tissue microarray format is able to predict treatment benefit and harm from adjuvant 
zoledronic acid. To our knowledge, this is the first time a biomarker has been described that can potentially 
identify patients who may benefit from treatment with an adjuvant bisphosphonate. 
The tissues used in this study were collected from patients taking part in the prospectively randomized AZURE 
trial designed to evaluate the effects of adjuvant ZOL on disease outcomes in stage II/III breast cancer; the 
primary results from this trial have been reported previously.2,9 The tissues had been fixed in paraffin for >10 
years and the FISH test performed on 1mm cores within TMA format – a technically much more challenging 
exercise than would be the case if the MAFTEST could have been performed on contemporary tissue sections. 
Of note one third of cores had insufficient tumor in the cut section of the TMA block. All of these factors 
explain the attrition in patients with a MAFTEST result for the pre-planned statistical analyses. Despite these 
  
8 
technical challenges in obtaining a reliable confirmed FISH test on relatively old paraffin embedded fixed 
tissues in TMA format, our findings show that adjuvant ZOL improved disease outcomes in the 79% of patients 
with a <2.5 MAF copy number (MAF-ve) and importantly, unlike in the study as a whole, this beneficial 
treatment effect was independent of menopausal status at study entry suggesting that the use of adjuvant 
bisphosphonates could be extended to the 80% of premenopausal women with a MAF-ve tumour, equivalent to 
around 16% of the early breast cancer population.  
Conversely, the use of adjuvant ZOL in women with a gain in MAF gene (MAF+ve tumours) was not 
associated with treatment benefit and in women who were not postmenopausal at the start of treatment, the use 
of ZOL in the context of a MAF+ve tumour was associated with more frequent extra-skeletal spread, resulting 
in significantly worse IDFS and OS. Findings were similar when age ≤ or > 50 years was used as a surrogate 
for menopause. Our data strongly suggest that such women should not receive an adjuvant bisphosphonate. 
There are limitations to our study. Firstly, this is a retrospective analysis of data from a prospective randomised 
clinical trial and requires confirmation in another data-set. Secondly, because of the complex interactions 
between MAF, bisphosphonate treatment and menopause, the number of MAF evaluable patients is relatively 
small to assess outcome reliably in some of the subgroups of interest. Thirdly, although we mandated 
assessment of MAF on two tissue cores per patient to reduce the impact of tumour heterogeneity, evaluation of 
routine tissue sections may reveal greater heterogeneity of expression than we could identify in replicate TMA 
cores.  
The use of adjuvant bisphosphonates in early breast cancer and selection of appropriate patients remain areas of 
controversy. Following the findings of treatment benefits with adjuvant ZOL in young women receiving 
ovarian suppression therapy for ER+ breast cancer11 and the positive findings in a pre-planned subset analysis 
by menopause within the AZURE trial9, a hypothesis was generated that adjuvant bisphosphonate efficacy is 
related to levels of reproductive hormones at the time of treatment initiation. This hypothesis was rigorously 
tested by a large individual patient meta-analysis conducted by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists Collaborative 
Group (EBCTCG)1. Data were collected from 18,766 women randomized in adjuvant bisphosphonate trials. 
There were no demonstrable benefits of adjuvant bisphosphonates in premenopausal women, but in 11,767 
postmenopausal women, highly significant reductions in bone recurrence (RR=0.72; 95%CI 0.60-0.86, 
2p=0.0002) and breast cancer mortality (0.82; 95%CI 0.73-0.93, 2p=0.002) were seen. These results have led to 
supportive clinical guidelines12, and recommendations by both European and American expert groups to 
incorporate adjuvant bisphosphonates into routine clinical care.5,6 However, despite the clinically important 
effects on breast cancer mortality, global acceptance has been slow, in part due to the opinion that these 
benefits relate only to a subset of patients that is somewhat imprecise in its definition and also that the 
mechanistic explanation for the findings are unclear6.  
Our findings should be considered as hypothesis generating but, clearly suggest that the beneficial effects of 
ZOL on the underlying breast cancer are associated with the presence of a non-amplified MAF gene within the 
primary tumour. On the contrary, MAF+ve tumours in non post-menopausal women experience a worse 
outcome with ZOL. In these younger, not postmenopausal women, there seem to be two distinct populations, 
MAF-ve who, like older MAF-ve patients, benefit from zoledronic acid and MAF+ve for whom use of 
zoledronic acid in the presence of reproductive hormones appears to stimulate the emergence of extra-skeletal 
metastatic disease and worse survival, resulting in a net nil effect in the non-postmenopausal subgroup both in 
the biomarker cohort and the AZURE study population as a whole. Additional mechanistic studies addressing 
the importance of MAF in cancer metastasis are in progress. It is hoped that these investigations may provide 
some biological insights into the differential effects of bisphosphonates on disease outcomes according to MAF 
status and menopause and help us understand how tumour biology, treatments that influence the metastatic 
niche and the endocrine milieu, that influence both host and tumour cell functions, all interact. Additionally, 
evaluation of MAF in another large randomized trial of adjuvant bisphosphonates is required before our 
findings could be considered for routine clinical practice. This is planned to take place in 2018 using the 
NSABP B3413 tumor bank and data set of patients randomized to either treatment with the oral bisphosphonate, 
clodronate or placebo. 
In this study of 865 patients and a median follow-up of 84 months, there were still only 60 IDFS events in 
bone, making interpretation of any relationships between MAF and bone relapse unreliable. We were thus 
unable to confirm the prognostic capability of MAF proposed by Pavlovic et al.8 In this evaluation of the 
AZURE study population, MAF amplification was associated with other adverse biological characteristics such 
as ER negativity, high grade and Her2 positivity, but was unable to meet its primary objective of providing 
clinically useful independent bone metastasis prognostic information in the control population as a whole. 
Although MAF+ve tumours were associated with worse disease outcomes in the subset of postmenopausal 
breast cancer patients in the control group, these findings are not sufficient to recommend its use in the 
assessment of risk prognosis in routine practice. Because bone relapses typically occur late in the follow-up of 
  
9 
patients with early breast cancer, further evaluation is planned now that all patients have completed 10 years of 
follow-up; this is anticipated to increase the number of bone events by around one third.  Other data sets are 
thus likely to be necessary to assess whether the originally described relationship between MAF+ve tumours 
and the development of bone metastases holds true. However, we believe the clinical interest in MAF relates to 
the predictive capabilities described rather than potential use as another prognostic factor.  
The heterogeneity in IDFS by menopause for women with MAF-ve tumours within the control arm cannot be 
adequately explained by imbalance in other prognostic factors. Other than a slight excess of larger T2-4 
tumours (72% versus 62%) in the MAF-ve non-postmenopausal and postmenopausal control populations 
respectively, the clinical and pathologic characteristics of this younger MAF-ve population appear similar. 
Collectively, our observations point to MAF as a potential molecular target for the prevention or treatment of 
metastases from breast cancer8. Although required for metastasis, MAF is a very challenging pharmacological 
target because of its nuclear localization and lack of a catalytic domain. Dissecting the role of genes that are 
transcriptionally regulated by MAF may lead to the identification of potentially targetable proteins that are 
necessary for metastasis8. Amongst the genes transcriptionally regulated by MAF are potentially targetable 
proteins that contribute to support bone metastasis14,15. 
In conclusion, our findings suggest that MAF status may become a clinically useful biomarker for treatment 
selection.  FISH testing for MAF copy number may allow better and more precise selection of patients for 
adjuvant treatment with ZOL. MAF-ve patients are likely to represent almost 80% of breast cancers who could 
benefit from the use of adjuvant ZOL. On the other hand, because the presence of a MAF+ve tumour appears to 
be associated with adverse disease outcomes when patients are treated with bisphosphonates - especially if 
treatment is initiated before menopause is complete - such patients with MAF+ve tumours should avoid 
exposure to bisphosphonates in the adjuvant setting.

Abstract 
Background: In early breast cancer (EBC), the adjuvant use of bisphosphonates reduces the incidence of bone 
metastases but only appears to improve overall recurrence and survival in postmenopausal patients. The 
mechanisms underlying these observations remain unclear. To address this, we tested the recently identified 
bone relapse biomarker, MAF gene gain (MAF+) in primary tumours from women included in the AZURE trial 
(ISRCTN79831382) to determine the prognostic value of MAF and its potential to predict the effects of 
adjuvant zoledronic acid (ZOL) on disease outcomes. 
Methods: The AZURE trial is an academic, prospective, open label, randomised phase III multicentre, parallel-
group trial, performed in 3360 women with stage II/III breast cancer to receive standard adjuvant systemic 
therapy alone or with ZOL every 3-4 weeks for 6 doses, then 3-6 monthly thereafter to complete 5 years 
treatment. Consenting patients were randomised on a 1:1 basis using a central automated 24-hour computer-
generated telephone randomisation system that included a minimisation process that took into account the 
number of involved axillary lymph nodes, clinical tumour stage, oestrogen receptor status, type and timing of 
systemic therapy, menopausal status, statin use and treating centre. The primary endpoint was disease 
recurrence. MAF was detected in breast tumours in tissue microarray format using a validated (MAF/D16Z3) 
FISH test, MAFTEST (Inbiomotion, Spain) in a blinded fashion by a central laboratory (Targos, Germany). A 
copy number cut-off ≥2.5 was preset to define a MAF+ve tumour.  Multivariate analyses of disease outcomes 
by MAF status were performed in control and ZOL patients separately on an intention to treat basis according 
to a pre-specified analysis plan. Interactions between MAF+ve and menopausal status on effects of ZOL were 
also evaluated. 
Findings: Of the 1769 AZURE patients who donated primary tumour samples, 865 (49%) had 2 FISH 
evaluable cores of which 184 (21%) were MAF+ve. MAF+ve tumours were more likely to be of higher grade, 
ER-ve and Her2+. At a median follow-up of 84 months, MAF was not prognostic in control patients for 
invasive disease free (IDFS) or overall (OS) survival, but in ZOL treated patients those with a MAF-ve tumor 
had better IDFS (HRIDFS=0.52 [0.36-0.75] and OS (HROS=0.48 [0.31-0.75]). In patients with MAF-ve tumours, 
ZOL was associated with improved IDFS (HRIDFS=0.74 [0.56-0.98]). However in patients with MAF+ve 
tumours, ZOL did not improve disease outcomes and, in the 119 MAF+ve patients who were not 
postmenopausal at randomisation, ZOL was associated with much worse outcomes (HRIDFS=2.47 [1.23-4.97] 
and HROS=2.27 [1.04-4.93]). The interactions between disease outcomes, ZOL use and menopausal status were 
driven largely by an excess of extraskeletal recurrences (E-IDFS) in women with MAF+ve tumours who 
initiated ZOL before the development of menopause (HRE-IDFS=6.92, [2.44-19.6]).  
Interpretation: FISH evaluation of MAF in EBC segregates patients likely to benefit from adjuvant ZOL 
(MAF-ve) from those who may be harmed (not postmenopausal MAF+ve) and merits further investigation as a 
potential companion diagnostic.

measurements and statistical analyses were funded by Inbiomotion (Barcelona, Spain).

Introduction 
Meta-analysis of clinical trials has shown that adjuvant bisphosphonates (especially zoledronic acid [ZOL] or 
clodronate) reduce bone metastases and improve survival in postmenopausal patients with early breast cancer1. 
The AZURE study of adjuvant zoledronic acid in early breast cancer was the first study to identify the benefits 
of adjuvant bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women2 and prompted the confirmatory meta-analysis of this 
subgroup finding,1 In addition, marked heterogeneity according to menopausal status in the rates of recurrence 
outside bone was seen, with an increase in extraskeletal metastases in women who were not postmenopausal at 
study entry. However, despite recapitulation of these clinical observations in preclinical animal models of bone 
metastases3, the biological mechanisms underpinning these apparent interactions between treatment effects and 
menopausal status are unknown.  
There are many clinical, pathologic and molecular biomarkers that have been used to assess prognosis in early 
breast cancer although none, with the possible exception of estrogen receptor status, are useful to specifically 
identify patients at high risk for bone metastases. Gene profiles that may specifically predict for bone 
recurrence4 were first described a decade ago but none are currently used in clinical practice. In terms of 
predicting treatment benefits, menopausal status (and by association age) are recommended in clinical practice 
guidelines for selection of patients likely to benefit from adjuvant bisphosphonate5,6. However, the imprecise 
definition and timing of menopause, makes this a somewhat difficult criterion on which to select patients most 
likely to benefit. Recently, using a proteomic discovery platform, the co-expression of GIPC1 and CAPG 
proteins by primary tumours was shown to predict benefit from adjuvant ZOL in early breast cancer.7 However, 
to date, there are no confirmatory datasets supporting the clinical application of this discovery and the 
reproducibility of these analyses awaits confirmation. Thus, there is currently no biomarker to select patients 
for treatment with adjuvant ZOL. 
To address this, the recently identified early breast cancer bone relapse biomarker, MAF gene gain (MAF+)8 
was tested retrospectively in the large prospectively randomized AZURE trial2,9, of standard adjuvant therapy 
+/- ZOL in high risk early breast cancer. Overexpression of MAF, a transcription factor of the AP-1 family and 
encoded within the 16q arm, supports the molecular processes that affect the metastatic course from the 
primary site to distal colonization8. MAF regulates the expression of a set of genes that collectively support 
several steps of breast cancer cell metastasis through a series of cell-autonomous and niche-related functions8. 
Collectively, these observations suggest that MAF accumulation (MAF gain) may enable the identification of 
patients at high risk of metastasis. In this report, we have determined the prognostic value of MAF and its 
potential to predict the effects of ZOL on disease outcomes. 
Methods 
Study Design and patients 
3360 patients from 174 centres were recruited between September 2003 and March 2006 to the AZURE study.  
Eligibility criteria have been reported previously2,9 but, in summary, patients had to have histologically 
confirmed invasive breast cancer of any subtype with either pathologically involved axillary lymph node 
metastasis or a T3/T4 primary tumour treated with curative intent. Prior complete resection of the primary 
tumour was necessary or had to be planned if patients were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients 
had to be age ≥18 with a Karnofsky performance status index ≥80 and neither pregnant or breast-feeding to be 
eligible. Patients were not eligible if there was clinical or imaging evidence of distant metastases prior to study 
entry, current or recent (previous year) use of bisphosphonates or pre-existing bone disease likely to require 
bone-targeted treatment.  
All patients gave written informed consent and, in the United Kingdom only, additional specific consent to use 
of biological materials (primary tumour and blood samples was requested. Patients could participate in the main 
trial alone if they so chose. Prior to randomisation, haematological, renal and hepatic function tests were 
required. Staging imaging tests were performed in accordance with institutional protocols.  The full protocol 
may be viewed at http://ctru.leeds.ac.uk/Azure 
The outcome data for the AZURE study have been previously reported2,9 and the planned final analysis data-
lock2 was used for the analyses described below.  
Procedures 
Eligible patients were randomized to receive (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy +/- ZOL 
4mg iv every 3-4 weeks for 6 doses, then 3 monthly x 8 and 6 monthly x 5 to complete 5 years treatment. 
Calcium and vitamin D oral supplements were recommended for all trial subjects during the first six months on 
study, and continued thereafter at the discretion of the treating physician. Both the use of adjuvant systemic 
  
4 
treatments and loco-regional radiotherapy were given in accordance with standard protocols at each 
participating institution. 
The follow-up schedule was similar in both arms of the study and included clinical assessment, adverse event 
monitoring and haematological, renal and hepatic function test measurements. Routine follow-up imaging was 
not mandated, with investigations for possible recurrence clinically directed as deemed appropriate by the 
treating physician. The date of recurrence was defined as the date on which relapse was first suspected, to 
reduce the risk of ascertainment bias.  91% of recurrences were independently validated by either on-site or 
telephone-based monitoring. Subjects were followed up on an annual basis after completion of the 5-year 
treatment phase (ZOL or control) for both disease and relevant safety endpoints.  
Of the 3360 patients accrued in the trial, primary tumour tissue blocks were collected from 1769/2710 (65%) 
patients treated at participating sites in the UK. Site participation in the collection of tumour blocks was 
encouraged but not mandatory and, for logistical reasons, restricted to UK sites.  
All tumour blocks were sent to Sheffield for tissue microarray (TMA) construction where the location of 
invasive tumour within the tissue blocks was indicated by a single breast pathologist as a guide to the 
technician extracting the tissue cores for construction of the TMAs. Quadruplicate cores of 1 mm in diameter of 
each of the tumour tissue sample were arranged in 4 sets of 13 TMAs (150 samples each). All analyses are 
restricted to study participants who gave specific patient consent for the use of tissue samples. 
The MAF biomarker analysis was completed on TMAs from primary tumours. Sample handling, methodology, 
scoring and statistical analyses were pre-specified in a study charter and statistical analysis plan. 5 μm thick 
tissue sections were cut from each TMA block, orientated to ensure correlation with the TMA map to allow 
identification of each tissue core and mounted onto Superfrost plus glass slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific).  
TMA slices were first analyzed using haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining to determine the presence of 
evaluable tumour. MAF amplification was then assessed using a validated (MAF/D16Z3) FISH test, 
MAFTEST, (Inbiomotion, Barcelona, Spain).  A central laboratory (Targos Molecular Pathology, Kassel, 
Germany) validated the assay for analytic and diagnostic performance, established acceptance criteria, included 
appropriate quality controls for each assay, and performed the analyses in a blinded fashion. The previously 
described immunohistochemical (IHC) test for MAF8 was found to perform sub-optimally on the TMA samples 
available, presumably due to epitope decay in the >10 years since fixation and is not considered further in this 
report.   
Briefly, TMA sections were deparaffinated in Xylene (2x for 10 min), rehydrated in ethanol series, washed 
with water and pretreated at 98ºC for 15 min. Samples were digested with pepsin (Poseidon Tissue Digestion 
Kit, Kreatech, Amsterdam, Netherlands) for 30 min, dehydrated in ethanol series and dried. After adding 10 μl 
of MAF/D16Z3 probe (Inbiomotion), slides were denatured at 80ºC and placed overnight in a hybridizer at 
37ºC. After hybridization, FISH slides were washed in Wash Buffer I at 72ºC for 2 min and then Wash Buffer 
II (both Poseidon Tissue Digestion Kit, Kreatech) for 1 min at room temperature. After dehydration and air-
drying, slides were incubated with 15 μl of DAPI solution (0.03 mg/ml) and stored at 4ºC in the dark until 
scoring. 
Mean MAF copy number per nuclei was scored by blinded central laboratory personnel in 20 nuclei from 
regions of the tumour with the highest amplification. If MAF mean copy number was between 2.0 and 3.0, an 
additional 30 nuclei were scored. Replica cores were scored until 2 FISH amplification values were obtained 
for each tumour. The highest value of MAF amplification in 2 evaluable samples of a patient was chosen for 
statistical analysis. The tumours on TMAs were FISH analysed only once, with no optimization and no 
repetitions allowed by protocol. A patient was considered as positive for MAF amplification when at least one 
of the replicas had a mean number of MAF copies per nuclei equal or higher than 2.5. The copy number cut-off 
≥2.5 was predefined for MAF positivity (MAF+ve) based on studies in a retrospective cohort8 and set at a level 
that was unlikely to be artificially influenced by rapid proliferation. 
Statistical analysis 
Following eligibility confirmation, patients were randomised by the treating clinical team on a 1:1 basis, using 
a central automated 24-hour computer-generated telephone minimisation system to ensure the concealment of 
the next treatment assignment based at the Clinical Trials Research Unit (CTRU), University of Leeds, to either 
standard adjuvant therapy alone (control) or with zoledronic acid monohydrate (ZOL), Novartis 
Pharmaceuticals, Summit, New Jersey, USA. To reduce possible imbalances in tumour and treatment 
characteristics, a minimisation process was used that took into account the number of involved axillary lymph 
nodes, clinical tumour stage, oestrogen receptor status, type and timing of systemic therapy, menopausal status, 
statin use and treating centre.  
  
5 
The primary endpoint of the AZURE trial was disease free survival (DFS), defined as distant recurrence, any 
invasive loco-regional recurrence except for ipsilateral operable relapse within a conserved breast, and death 
without recurrence. As described more fully in previous reports,2,9 invasive DFS (IDFS) was added as a key 
secondary endpoint to reflect the international standard definition for recurrence that had emerged since the 
trial began10 and is the primary disease endpoint assessed in this report. Secondary endpoints included overall 
survival (OS) defined as death from any cause after randomisation, time to bone metastases and subgroup 
analyses based on variables included in the randomisation including menopausal status. This study is registered 
as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN79831382 
For this report, our hypothesis was that MAF status would have potential value as a prognostic factor for 
disease recurrence, especially in bone and as a predictive factor for response to adjuvant ZOL. The 
relationships in the control group were specified as the primary endpoint with those in the ZOL group 
exploratory. IDFS, OS, time to first IDFS event in bone (as first event or at any time) and time to first IDFS 
event not in bone endpoints, all defined as in the main study,2,9 were assessed on all patients in the AZURE 
safety population with an evaluable MAFTEST. Subsequently, because disease outcomes by menopausal status 
had been pre-specified analyses in the AZURE protocol and reported in the main study reports,2,9 interactions 
between MAF+ve and effects of ZOL on disease outcomes by menopausal status were also pre-specified in the 
statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
The SAP was defined before any data analysis was performed. All statistical analyses were performed at the 
Clinical Trials Research Unit, University of Leeds where the AZURE clinical trial database is held on behalf of 
the trial sponsor, the University of Sheffield. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS statistical 
software version 9.4. The SAP may be found in appendix p2-4. 
The prognostic value of MAF status for IDFS and OS were investigated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, 
whilst the time to first IDFS event in bone endpoint was assessed using a cumulative incidence function curve 
utilising a Fine and Gray approach. Differences in outcomes between patients with MAF+ve or MAF-ve 
tumours were compared using multivariable modelling in control patients only (Cox’s proportional hazards) to 
adjust for the AZURE minimisation factors described above (excluding treating centre). Hypothesis testing was 
two-sided at a 5% significance level. No adjustments have been made for multiplicity.  
For the predictive analyses, the response to zoledronic acid treatment was tested comparing control and ZOL 
groups. A predictive analysis, assessing the interaction of MAF status with treatment allocation, was performed 
using a Cox proportional hazards model. Only minimization factors identified as statistically significant in the 
prognostic analysis were included in the model to reduce potential overfitting. In addition, predictive analyses 
were carried out for patients who were unequivocally post-menopausal (>5 years since last menses) at trial 
entry separately to patients who were not post-menopausal (pre-menopausal, ≤5 years since menopause and 
menopausal status unknown), given the significant heterogeneity of treatment effect between established post-
menopausal patients and all other patients observed in the AZURE trial as a whole9.  
Additional exploratory analyses were conducted for IDFS in all patients using a Cox proportional hazards 
model including the prognostic factors specified for the predictive analysis. The model included a three-way 
interaction term between MAF, menopausal status and treatment. Sensitivity analyses were conducted 
including all prognostic factors as specified in the prognostic analysis for this model. Because of the 
complexity of defining menopause and in recognition that it is a biological process that occurs over years, the 
model was also fit with age as a surrogate for the menopausal status term; with an arbitrary cut-point of ≥ or 
<50 at randomization. 
 
Role of the Funding Source 
The AZURE trial was sponsored by the University of Sheffield and academic grant support provided by 
Novartis, supplemented by the infrastructure of the National Cancer Research Network. Novartis funded the 
sample collection but had no input in the study design, analysis or interpretation of data, nor in writing of the 
report. Inbiomotion had no involvement in the AZURE study design, or data analysis but JJM and JT did 
provide input into the statistical analysis plan, commented on the interpretation of the data and reviewed and 
approved the manuscript as co-authors. Biomarker measurements and statistical analyses were funded by 
Inbiomotion. Inbiomotion reviewed the manuscript but all decisions on publication rested with the authors. The 
corresponding author had full access to all of the data and the final responsibility for publication. 
Results 
The primary tumours from 1739 patients had been processed between August 2003 and February 2006 
according to routine local laboratory standard operating procedures and the TMAs prepared in 2007 and 2008 
from representative tumour blocks sent to the University of Sheffield. Sections from the TMAs were sent to the 
  
6 
independent laboratory (TARGOS) for all analyses. Despite marking of the tumour blocks by an experienced 
pathologist before TMA construction, only 3978 out of 6326 TMA cores (63%) had sufficient invasive tumour 
confirmed on an H&E stained slide within each individual core for FISH analysis . The MAFTEST FISH assay 
was performed on adjacent sections and could be reliably assessed according to the stringent quality standards 
of the independent laboratory (TARGOS) in 2067 of 3978 (56%) tissues cores with sufficient invasive tumour. 
To reduce the impact of tumour heterogeneity in such small fragments of the original tumour, duplicate 
evaluable results from each patient were mandated. 865 of 1739 patients (50%) providing primary tumour for 
assessment had 2 evaluable FISH results and of these, 184 of 865 patients (21%) had a MAF+ve tumour.  
The median follow-up was 84.6 (IQR 72.0-95.8) months. 282 patients in this biomarker subset had experienced 
an IDFS event (147 control, 135 ZOL), 60 a first IDFS event in bone (39 control, 21 ZOL) and 193 an OS 
event (102 control, 91 ZOL). The proportions of MAFTEST analyzed patients with an IDFS or OS event were 
similar to the main study; 5 year IDFS probabilities for the ZOL and control arms respectively in this biomarker 
population were 74.1% (95%CI 69.8-78.3) and 73.7% (95%CI 69.6-77.8) compared with 75.1% (95%CI 73.0-
77.2) and 73.9% (95%CI 71.7-76.0) in the overall study population.  
Patient characteristics in those patients with TMA cores evaluable for MAF gain were similar to the entire 
cohort of patients included in AZURE (Table 1). More patients with MAF+ve tumours had high grade, ER 
negative and HER2 positive tumours than did those with MAF-ve tumours (Table 2). As a result of these 
factors, patients with MAF+ve tumours were more likely to have received taxanes and trastuzumab and less 
likely to require endocrine treatments than for the whole group. The frequency of MAF+ve tumours was similar 
across menopausal subsets and age. Given the heterogeneity of the prognostic factors in the baseline 
demographics, results are reported using the multivariable Cox modelling.  
Pre-specified analyses 
Relationships between MAF status and prognosis  
In the control patient group, 118 of 360 MAF-ve (33%) and 29 of 85 MAF+ (34%) experienced an IDFS event 
and MAF was not prognostic for IDFS (HR:0.92, 95%CI 0.59-1.41) However, this result is not fully 
representative of the data as the impact of MAF status on disease outcome was found to be significantly 
influenced by menopausal status at randomization, test for interaction (TFI) IDFS by menopause, Chi2=7.34, 
P=0.009 (Figure 1). In postmenopausal women, the hazard ratio for IDFS (HRIDFS) for MAF-ve/MAF+ve was 
0.47 [95%CI 0.25-0.88], suggesting MAF is indeed prognostic for IDFS in this group of patients. However, in 
contrast, for non-postmenopausal women, the HRIDFS for MAF-ve/MAF+ve was 1.58 [95%CI 0.82-3.03]. 
Lymph node involvement, tumour stage, ER status and histological grade were found to be significant in the 
prognostic analysis and are included in the predictive analysis modelling. 
In ZOL patients, MAF provided prognostic information, with worse IDFS in MAF+ve tumors (Figure 1). 
(HRIDFS for MAF-ve/MAF+ve = 0.52 [95%CI 0.36-0.75] and HROS for MAF-ve/MAF+ve =0.48 [95%CI 0.31-
0.75] (figure Appendix page 1). 
There were insufficient bone events (13 bone only and 6 bone with other sites in MAF+ve, 47 bone only and 26 
bone with other sites in MAF-ve) in this sample set to reliably assess the relationships between MAF status and 
relapse in bone.  
Relationships between MAF status and treatment effects 
There was an IDFS MAF/treatment interaction for patients overall χ2=4.55, p=0.03; this result however is 
convoluted by the interaction between menopausal status and MAF found in the prognostic analysis above. In 
subgroup analyses for IDFS there was a MAF/treatment interaction for non-postmenopausal patients (χ2=9.23, 
p=0.002), but not for postmenopausal patients (χ2=0.09, p=0.76).   
In patients with MAF-ve tumours, treatment with ZOL was associated with improved IDFS compared to 
control patients (HRIDFS ZOL/CONTROL=0.74 95%CI 0.56-0.98) (Figure 2). The group sizes, number of 
events and hazard ratios for the pre-planned menopausal sub-group and exploratory age analyses are shown in 
Figure 3. Treatment benefits with ZOL compared to control were similar irrespective of menopausal status or 
age.  
In patients with MAF+ve tumours the findings are more complex (Figure 3). Overall, zoledronic acid did not 
appear to improve IDFS (HRIDFS ZOL/CONTROL=1.34 [95%CI 0.83-2.14]). There was, however, significant 
heterogeneity of the treatment effect by menopause (hypothesis test reported in additional analyses). In women 
who were not postmenopausal at the start of treatment, there were clear adverse effects on IDFS (HRIDFS 
ZOL/CONTROL=2.47 [95% CI 1.23-4.97]).  In postmenopausal women, there were insufficient events, from 
the subset of MAF+ve tumours ( HRIDFS ZOL/CONTROL for MAF+ve postmenopausal women=0.74 [95%CI 
  
7 
0.35-1.58]) to establish a definitive relationship between MAF status and treatment effect, although the point 
estimate for the hazard ratio (albeit with wider confidence intervals) was similar to that seen in MAF –ve 
women. 
For OS, a similar relationship between treatment, menopause and MAF was seen.  There were fewer deaths in 
patients with MAF-ve tumours treated with ZOL (ZOL 57 events in 321 [18%] patients; CONTROL 76 events 
in 360 patients [21%];  (HROS ZOL/CONTROL=0.78 [95%CI 0.55-1.10]). In patients with MAF+ve tumours, 
no effect of ZOL on OS was seen  (ZOL 34 events in 99 [34%] patients; CONTROL 26 events in 85 patients 
[31%]; HROS ZOL/CONTROL=1.11 [95%CI 0.66-1.86]). However there is a clear adverse effect of ZOL in 
non-postmenopausal women with MAF+ve tumours (ZOL 24 events in 66 [36%] patients; CONTROL 9 events 
in 55 patients [16%]; HROS ZOL/CONTROL=4.64 [95%CI 1.33-16.25]) compared with a numerical beneficial 
treatment effect on OS ((ZOL 10 events in 33 [30%] patients; CONTROL 17 events in 30 patients [57%]; HROS 
ZOL/CONTROL=0.62 [95%CI 0.27-1.48]) in postmenopausal women with MAF+ve tumours.  
In 190 patients with an IDFS event, this was at an extraskeletal site (92 control, 98 ZOL). When compared with 
the control group, treatment with ZOL in non-postmenopausal women with MAF+ve tumours was associated 
with a marked increase in relapse (Figure 4) at extraskeletal sites. The extraskeletal IDFS estimates at 60 
months for MAF +ve tumors were 5.7% 95%CI 1.5-14.2%) for control patients and 38.8% (95%CI 27.1-
50.3%) for ZOL patients, (HRIDFS ZOL/CONTROL =6.92, 95%CI 2.44-19.6). ZOL had no effect on 
extraskeletal recurrences in non-postmenopausal patients with MAF-ve tumors; the extraskeletal IDFS 
estimates at 60 months for MAF -ve tumors were 18% 95%CI 13.5-23.1%) for control patients and 19.8% 
(95%CI 14.8-25.5%) for ZOL patients (HRIDFS ZOL/CONTROL=0.81, 95%CI 0.57-1.13).  
Additional exploratory analyses 
The menopausal subgroup analyses indicated that menopausal status at randomization was playing a role in 
how MAF influences IDFS disease outcomes. The cox model specified for the predictive analyses did not 
include any parameters for menopausal status; an exploratory Cox model was fitted to better understand any 
potential interactions. The likelihood ratio test for the three-way interaction term between MAF, menopausal 
status and treatment yields a χ 2 of 5.71 (P=0.017, 1DF), The model allows a hypothesis test for heterogeneity 
of the treatment effect by menopause for MAF subgroups; Wald heterogeneity Chi square statistics: 6.98 
(P=0.008, 1DF) and 0.38 (P=0.539, 1DF) for MAF+ve and MAF-ve patients respectively. 
Hazard Ratios (with 95%CIs) are presented using non-postmenopausal control patients with MAF-ve tumours 
as the reference group (Table 3). The individual hazard ratios are consistent with the prescribed analysis that 
IDFS outcome is independent of menopausal status when patients are treated with ZOL. There is however 
heterogeneity in IDFS outcomes by menopausal status in addition to MAF status in control patients. MAF+ve 
postmenopausal control patients have significantly worse IDFS outcome in contrast to MAF+ve non-
postmenopausal patients (HR non-post/post: 0.26, 95%CI 0.12-0.56). Interestingly non-postmenopausal 
patients with MAF+ tumours appear to have a better IDFS than do those that are MAF-ve (HR MAF+ve/MAF-
ve: 0.63, 95%CI 0.33-1.20).  
The exploratory model was fit using age as a surrogate for menopausal status, with an arbitrary cut-point of ≥ 
or <50 at randomization (Table 4). There is no difference in the interpretation of the results in IDFS when using 
age as a surrogate marker for menopause with a similar beneficial effect for ZOL in patients with MAF-ve 
tumours (Figure 3). Sensitivity analyses for the exploratory Cox model including all AZURE minimization 
factors were conducted and made no interpretable difference to the estimates (data not shown). 
Discussion 
Using an independent specialist biomarker laboratory and a pre-defined cut-off, blinded to patient 
demographic, treatment and outcome data, we have shown that tumour copy number of the MAF transcription 
factor encoded by MAF gene with a precisely developed MAF/D16Z3 FISH test performed on archival primary 
breast tumours in tissue microarray format is able to predict treatment benefit and harm from adjuvant 
zoledronic acid. To our knowledge, this is the first time a biomarker has been described that can potentially 
identify patients who may benefit from treatment with an adjuvant bisphosphonate. 
The tissues used in this study were collected from patients taking part in the prospectively randomized AZURE 
trial designed to evaluate the effects of adjuvant ZOL on disease outcomes in stage II/III breast cancer; the 
primary results from this trial have been reported previously.2,9 The tissues had been fixed in paraffin for >10 
years and the FISH test performed on 1mm cores within TMA format – a technically much more challenging 
exercise than would be the case if the MAFTEST could have been performed on contemporary tissue sections. 
Of note one third of cores had insufficient tumor in the cut section of the TMA block. All of these factors 
explain the attrition in patients with a MAFTEST result for the pre-planned statistical analyses. Despite these 
  
8 
technical challenges in obtaining a reliable confirmed FISH test on relatively old paraffin embedded fixed 
tissues in TMA format, our findings show that adjuvant ZOL improved disease outcomes in the 79% of patients 
with a <2.5 MAF copy number (MAF-ve) and importantly, unlike in the study as a whole, this beneficial 
treatment effect was independent of menopausal status at study entry suggesting that the use of adjuvant 
bisphosphonates could be extended to the 80% of premenopausal women with a MAF-ve tumour, equivalent to 
around 16% of the early breast cancer population.  
Conversely, the use of adjuvant ZOL in women with a gain in MAF gene (MAF+ve tumours) was not 
associated with treatment benefit and in women who were not postmenopausal at the start of treatment, the use 
of ZOL in the context of a MAF+ve tumour was associated with more frequent extra-skeletal spread, resulting 
in significantly worse IDFS and OS. Findings were similar when age ≤ or > 50 years was used as a surrogate 
for menopause. Our data strongly suggest that such women should not receive an adjuvant bisphosphonate. 
There are limitations to our study. Firstly, this is a retrospective analysis of data from a prospective randomised 
clinical trial and requires confirmation in another data-set. Secondly, because of the complex interactions 
between MAF, bisphosphonate treatment and menopause, the number of MAF evaluable patients is relatively 
small to assess outcome reliably in some of the subgroups of interest. Thirdly, although we mandated 
assessment of MAF on two tissue cores per patient to reduce the impact of tumour heterogeneity, evaluation of 
routine tissue sections may reveal greater heterogeneity of expression than we could identify in replicate TMA 
cores.  
The use of adjuvant bisphosphonates in early breast cancer and selection of appropriate patients remain areas of 
controversy. Following the findings of treatment benefits with adjuvant ZOL in young women receiving 
ovarian suppression therapy for ER+ breast cancer11 and the positive findings in a pre-planned subset analysis 
by menopause within the AZURE trial9, a hypothesis was generated that adjuvant bisphosphonate efficacy is 
related to levels of reproductive hormones at the time of treatment initiation. This hypothesis was rigorously 
tested by a large individual patient meta-analysis conducted by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists Collaborative 
Group (EBCTCG)1. Data were collected from 18,766 women randomized in adjuvant bisphosphonate trials. 
There were no demonstrable benefits of adjuvant bisphosphonates in premenopausal women, but in 11,767 
postmenopausal women, highly significant reductions in bone recurrence (RR=0.72; 95%CI 0.60-0.86, 
2p=0.0002) and breast cancer mortality (0.82; 95%CI 0.73-0.93, 2p=0.002) were seen. These results have led to 
supportive clinical guidelines12, and recommendations by both European and American expert groups to 
incorporate adjuvant bisphosphonates into routine clinical care.5,6 However, despite the clinically important 
effects on breast cancer mortality, global acceptance has been slow, in part due to the opinion that these 
benefits relate only to a subset of patients that is somewhat imprecise in its definition and also that the 
mechanistic explanation for the findings are unclear6.  
Our findings should be considered as hypothesis generating but, clearly suggest that the beneficial effects of 
ZOL on the underlying breast cancer are associated with the presence of a non-amplified MAF gene within the 
primary tumour. On the contrary, MAF+ve tumours in non post-menopausal women experience a worse 
outcome with ZOL. In these younger, not postmenopausal women, there seem to be two distinct populations, 
MAF-ve who, like older MAF-ve patients, benefit from zoledronic acid and MAF+ve for whom use of 
zoledronic acid in the presence of reproductive hormones appears to stimulate the emergence of extra-skeletal 
metastatic disease and worse survival, resulting in a net nil effect in the non-postmenopausal subgroup both in 
the biomarker cohort and the AZURE study population as a whole. Additional mechanistic studies addressing 
the importance of MAF in cancer metastasis are in progress. It is hoped that these investigations may provide 
some biological insights into the differential effects of bisphosphonates on disease outcomes according to MAF 
status and menopause and help us understand how tumour biology, treatments that influence the metastatic 
niche and the endocrine milieu, that influence both host and tumour cell functions, all interact. Additionally, 
evaluation of MAF in another large randomized trial of adjuvant bisphosphonates is required before our 
findings could be considered for routine clinical practice. This is planned to take place in 2018 using the 
NSABP B3413 tumor bank and data set of patients randomized to either treatment with the oral bisphosphonate, 
clodronate or placebo. 
In this study of 865 patients and a median follow-up of 84 months, there were still only 60 IDFS events in 
bone, making interpretation of any relationships between MAF and bone relapse unreliable. We were thus 
unable to confirm the prognostic capability of MAF proposed by Pavlovic et al.8 In this evaluation of the 
AZURE study population, MAF amplification was associated with other adverse biological characteristics such 
as ER negativity, high grade and Her2 positivity, but was unable to meet its primary objective of providing 
clinically useful independent bone metastasis prognostic information in the control population as a whole. 
Although MAF+ve tumours were associated with worse disease outcomes in the subset of postmenopausal 
breast cancer patients in the control group, these findings are not sufficient to recommend its use in the 
assessment of risk prognosis in routine practice. Because bone relapses typically occur late in the follow-up of 
  
9 
patients with early breast cancer, further evaluation is planned now that all patients have completed 10 years of 
follow-up; this is anticipated to increase the number of bone events by around one third.  Other data sets are 
thus likely to be necessary to assess whether the originally described relationship between MAF+ve tumours 
and the development of bone metastases holds true. However, we believe the clinical interest in MAF relates to 
the predictive capabilities described rather than potential use as another prognostic factor.  
The heterogeneity in IDFS by menopause for women with MAF-ve tumours within the control arm cannot be 
adequately explained by imbalance in other prognostic factors. Other than a slight excess of larger T2-4 
tumours (72% versus 62%) in the MAF-ve non-postmenopausal and postmenopausal control populations 
respectively, the clinical and pathologic characteristics of this younger MAF-ve population appear similar. 
Collectively, our observations point to MAF as a potential molecular target for the prevention or treatment of 
metastases from breast cancer8. Although required for metastasis, MAF is a very challenging pharmacological 
target because of its nuclear localization and lack of a catalytic domain. Dissecting the role of genes that are 
transcriptionally regulated by MAF may lead to the identification of potentially targetable proteins that are 
necessary for metastasis8. Amongst the genes transcriptionally regulated by MAF are potentially targetable 
proteins that contribute to support bone metastasis14,15. 
In conclusion, our findings suggest that MAF status may become a clinically useful biomarker for treatment 
selection.  FISH testing for MAF copy number may allow better and more precise selection of patients for 
adjuvant treatment with ZOL. MAF-ve patients are likely to represent almost 80% of breast cancers who could 
benefit from the use of adjuvant ZOL. On the other hand, because the presence of a MAF+ve tumour appears to 
be associated with adverse disease outcomes when patients are treated with bisphosphonates - especially if 
treatment is initiated before menopause is complete - such patients with MAF+ve tumours should avoid 
exposure to bisphosphonates in the adjuvant setting.
