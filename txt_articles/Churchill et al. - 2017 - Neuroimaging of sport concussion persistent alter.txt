structure and function at medical 
clearance

The medical decision of return to play (RTP) after a sport concussion is largely based on symptom 
status following a graded exercise protocol. However, it is currently unknown how objective markers 
of brain structure and function relate to clinical recovery. The goal of this study was to determine 
whether differences in brain structure and function at acute injury remain present at RTP. In this 
longitudinal study, 54 active varsity athletes were scanned using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 
including 27 with recent concussion, imaged at both acute injury and medical clearance, along with 27 
matched controls. Diffusion tensor imaging was used to measure fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean 
diffusivity (MD) of white matter and resting-state functional MRI was used to measure global functional 
connectivity (Gconn). At acute injury, concussed athletes had reduced FA and increased MD, along 
with elevated Gconn; these effects remained present at RTP. Athletes who took longer to reach RTP 
also showed elevated Gconn in dorsal brain regions, but no significant white matter effects. This study 
presents the first evidence of altered brain structure and function at the time of medical clearance to 
RTP, with greater changes in brain function for athletes with a longer recovery time.
Concussion in sport and recreation is a growing health concern, with an estimated 1.6 to 3.8 million injuries 
occurring each year in the United States alone1. It is defined as biomechanical injury leading to altered brain func-
tion and its sequelae include somatic, cognitive and emotional disturbances, which are usually most severe within 
the first week post-injury2. Nonetheless, concussion is rarely associated with structural abnormalities on standard 
clinical neuroimaging, which may include computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)3. 
The clinical determination of safe return-to-play (RTP) is primarily based on self-reported symptoms, with med-
ical clearance granted once the athlete is asymptomatic following a progressive exercise protocol2. Despite clinical 
recovery, there is evidence that individuals with a history of concussion are at risk for future injury4, 5 and in the 
long-term, they are at greater risk for depression and cognitive impairment2, 6. However, research on the deter-
mination of RTP has been largely epidemiological in nature, with limited information about the neurobiological 
changes that are associated with clinical recovery.
Advanced MRI is a promising tool for characterizing the subtle alterations in brain structure and function 
associated with concussion and recovery from injury. In this domain, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is one 
of the most widely used MRI techniques, able to detect changes in the microstructure of brain tissue, based 
on properties of water diffusion. Typically, DTI is used to measure fractional anisotropy (FA; reflecting direc-
tionality of water diffusion) and mean diffusivity (MD; quantifying total water diffusion, independent of direc-
tion) in white matter, where water in myelinated fibers exhibits highly restricted, anisotropic diffusion. Most DTI 
studies of sport concussion have been cross-sectional, reporting altered FA and MD at acute injury (i.e., within

the first week after sustaining a concussion)7, 8, along with significant white matter alterations months to years 
post-injury9–11 relative to uninjured controls. To date, only a few studies have examined longitudinal changes in 
white matter among concussed athletes, with Murugavel et al.12 showing recovery of microstructural abnormali-
ties from 2 days to 2 weeks post-injury, whereas Henry et al.13 found no significant changes from acute concussion 
to 6 months post-injury.
Functional MRI (fMRI) provides a method for assessing brain function, based on regional fluctuations in 
blood oxygenation levels. Although less widely employed in concussion research than DTI, fMRI has proven to be 
highly sensitive to altered brain function following mild traumatic injury14. In particular, there has been growing 
interest in resting-state fMRI, where functional connectivity can be measured by correlating the fMRI time-series 
between different brain regions. This quantifies functional integration in the brain, which may be disrupted by 
the effects of disease and neurological insult15, 16. As with DTI, most resting-state fMRI studies of concussion have 
been cross-sectional, showing altered functional connectivity at acute injury7 and during the sub-acute interval 
from 1 week to 1 month post-concussion17–19, relative to uninjured controls. A longitudinal study by Zhu et al.19 
reported significant reductions in functional connectivity from 1 to 7 days post-injury; however at present, little 
is known about functional recovery beyond the early phase of injury.
These findings have provided insight into the pathophysiology of concussion and preliminary evidence for 
MRI markers of brain recovery. Nevertheless, our understanding of concussion recovery remains at the very early 
stages. The few longitudinal MRI studies have focused on fixed post-injury time points, with no examination 
of neuroimaging markers specifically at the time of medical clearance. Moreover, these studies have generally 
focused on a single MRI modality, limiting our ability to compare functional and structural brain changes asso-
ciated with recovery. The present study addresses these gaps, by acquiring DTI and fMRI scans for a group of 
concussed athletes (1) during the first week post-injury and (2) following medical clearance to RTP, along with 
a group of individually-matched control athletes. In addition, the changes in MRI measures from acute injury 
to RTP were regressed against recovery time, to test for specific markers of brain structure and function that are 
associated with a prolonged recovery. This study was conducted on a balanced sample of male and female athletes 
and a mixture of contact and non-contact sports, to identify MRI markers of concussion recovery that are broadly 
relevant to the sporting community.
Results
Demographics and clinical data. 
In this study, fifty-four (54) athletes were recruited from interuniversity 
(“varsity”) teams at a single institution. Twenty-seven (27) athletes were recruited following a physician diagnosis 
of concussion, and scanned at two time-points: the acute phase post-injury (1–7 days post-injury) and at medical 
clearance to return to play (RTP). For comparison, 27 individually-matched control athletes were also scanned, 
who had no concussions in the 6 months prior to imaging. Based on structural imaging, no abnormalities (e.g., 
clinically significant white matter hyper-intensities, contusions and micro-hemorrhage) were identified for the 
concussed athlete group in this study.

Table 1 summarizes athlete demographics, including symptom and cognitive scores for the Sport Concussion 
Assessment Tool 3 (SCAT3), at each assessment time-point. For athletes with concussion, time to RTP was highly 
variable, ranging from 4 days to approximately 8 months. At acute injury, concussed athletes had significantly 
higher total symptoms and symptom severity compared to their pre-season baseline assessments (mean ± stand-
ard error for total symptoms: 5.2 ± 1.4; p = 0.006; total severity: 13.4 ± 5.0; p = 0.012, based on non-parametric 
paired Wilcoxon tests). Acutely concussed athletes also have elevated symptoms compared to matched control 
athletes (total symptoms: 5.5 ± 1.3; p = 0.001; total severity: 12.8 ± 4.4; p = 0.004). At RTP, total symptoms and 
total severity were significantly reduced relative to acute injury (total symptoms: −
7.6 ± 1.4; p < 0.001; total 
severity: −
16.2 ± 4.7; p < 0.001), and also significantly lower than their pre-season baseline (total symptoms: 
−
3.2 ± 0.9; p = 0.005; total severity: −
4.7 ± 1.5; p = 0.001). All symptom effects remained significant after adjust-
ing for multiple comparisons at a False-Discovery Rate (FDR) of 0.05. None of the other clinical measures were 
significantly different between acute injury and baseline, with p > 0.361 for all tests and concussed athletes show-
ing median scores near or at the maximum value for most tests. This indicates that for SCAT3 clinical assessments 
of cognition, memory and balance, concussed athletes tended to perform at ceiling.
Neuroimaging data: from acute injury to RTP. 
White matter microstructure was evaluated using DTI 
to measure fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) within white matter tracts. Resting brain func-
tion was evaluated using fMRI to measure global functional connectivity (Gconn), which quantifies total inte-
grative brain function. To determine how MRI measures in concussed athletes evolved from acute injury to RTP, 
relative to the control group, Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis was performed on each MRI measure (FA, MD, 
Gconn), to identify multivariate brain patterns (“voxel saliences”) that show greatest covariation between groups, 
with non-parametric bootstrap resampling used to assess significance of effects.
Figure 1 shows PLS results for fractional anisotropy (FA). Widespread effects are seen in white matter tracts 
(Fig. 1A), including clusters located predominantly within the right corona radiata and bilaterally in posterior 
limbs of the internal capsule. As depicted in Fig. 1B, these regions showed reduced average FA relative to controls, 
for athletes at acute concussion (mean difference ± standard error: −
0.0156 ± 0.003; p < 0.001, bootstrapped 
test of difference in PLS group saliences) and at RTP (mean difference: −
0.0167 ± 0.0031; p < 0.001). The aver-
age FA had further decreased from acute injury to RTP, however, the effect was non-significant (mean change: 
−
0.0013 ± 0.0020; p = 0.68), indicating persistent alterations in FA at medical clearance.
Figure 2 depicts PLS results for mean diffusivity (MD). Similar to FA, widespread effects are seen in white 
matter tracts (Fig. 2A), with clusters predominantly within bilateral corona radiata and posterior limbs of the 
internal capsule. As seen in Fig. 2B, these regions had increasing average MD relative to controls, at acute con-
cussion (mean difference: (1.84 ± 0.66) ×
 10−
5 mm/s; p = 0.004) and RTP (mean difference: (1.67 ± 0.52) ×
 10−
5 
mm/s; p < 0.001). Although average MD had decreased from acute injury to RTP, the effect was nonsignificant 
(mean change: (−
0.11 ± 0.37) ×
 10−
5 mm/s; p = 0.78), indicating persistent alterations in MD of white matter 
at the time of RTP.

Fig. 3B, average Gconn of athletes with acute concussion is significantly higher than controls (mean dif-
ference: 0.0310 ± 0.0120; p = 0.03), and continues to increase relative to controls at RTP (mean difference: 
0.0325 ± 0.0073; p < 0.001). However, the difference between acute injury and RTP was non-significant (mean 
change: 0.002 ± 0.008; p = 0.92), indicating persistently altered resting brain function at the time of medical 
clearance.
Neuroimaging data: effects of recovery time. 
An additional set of analyses tested whether there are 
patterns of brain change from acute injury to RTP that are associated with prolonged clinical recovery. For each 
MRI measure (FA, MD, Gconn) the set of within-subject paired differences in brain maps (RTP – acute) was 
regressed against total number of days from concussion to RTP, with bootstrapping used to assess significance 
of effects. Neither of the DTI measures showed significant association between brain changes at RTP (relative 
to acute injury) and the number of days to RTP, after adjusting for multiple comparisons. However, changes in 
Gconn were significantly related to time to RTP (Fig. 4A), within the supplementary motor area, paracentral lob-
ule and middle cingulum, along with left precentral and bilateral postcentral gyri. Figure 4B plots mean Gconn of 
significant brain voxels against days to RTP, with a regression coefficient of determination R2 = 0.282 (95% con-
fidence interval: 0.027, 0.631). As seen in the plot, athletes with shorter recovery times (i.e., less than one month) 
tended to have decreased Gconn at RTP relative to acute injury, whereas athletes with longer recovery times 
tended to have increased Gconn. Therefore, while concussed athletes exhibit regions of elevated connectivity 
that are unaltered from acute injury to RTP (Fig. 3), a separate set of brain regions show significant connectivity 
changes from acute injury to RTP, with the direction of effect depending on the time interval of clinical recovery.
Discussion
This study used advanced MRI to evaluate concussed athletes at both acute injury and medical clearance to RTP, 
to better understand the neurobiological changes related to clinical recovery. This addresses a significant gap in 
the literature, as prior longitudinal studies have largely focused on fixed post-injury time intervals. In addition, 
the investigation was conducted on a balanced sample of male and female athletes and a mixture of contact and 
non-contact sports, which reinforces the general relevance of these findings to the sporting community. MRI 
measures of brain structure and function were analyzed in a flexible multivariate PLS framework, to detect spa-
tially distributed changes in the brains of concussed athletes. The primary findings of this study included persis-
tent alterations in white matter microstructure and resting brain function at medical clearance to RTP, potentially 
indicating ongoing biological processes in the brain that persist beyond clinical recovery.
The DTI analyses revealed significantly altered brain microstructure at both acute injury and RTP, including 
decreased FA and elevated MD, which are consistent with prior studies of early injury9, 12. These effects may 
be driven by multiple physiological responses to concussion. Acute brain injury has been linked to intracellu-
lar edema, where the loss of ionic homeostasis leads to cellular swelling, with glial cells being predominantly 
affected20, 21. However, for some cohorts, intracellular edema has been associated with compressed interstitial 
spaces and elevated FA8. Brain injury may also induce vasogenic edema, where disruption of the blood-brain bar-
rier causes fluid uptake within interstitial spaces20. The present results are consistent with glial-mediated intracel-
lular edema and vasogenic edema, both of which may reduce FA and increase MD. Another potential contributor

is neuroinflammation due to disruptions of the blood-brain barrier, which may be caused by head impacts during 
sport participation22. Glial activation is a key component of the neuroinflammatory response23, thereby reducing 
FA and increasing MD. Other candidates for the observed microstructural changes include axonal injury, demy-
elination and structural reorganization24–26, although they are typically associated with more severe brain injury 
and longer post-injury time intervals. At present, we have an incomplete understanding of how these different 
processes contribute to the observed microstructural changes following a concussion, making this an important 
area of future investigation.
For both FA and MD, no significant differences were seen between acute injury and RTP, and changes in 
these measures were not significantly associated with days to RTP. This suggests that there are limited changes in 
brain microstructure within the examined post-concussion time interval (i.e., a median of 18 days from injury to 
RTP, ranging from 4 days to 8 months). These findings are supported by a prior DTI meta-analysis, which iden-
tified consistent long-term white matter abnormalities associated with mild traumatic brain injury27. In the sport 
domain, previous studies have reported altered white matter for athletes with a history of concussion, scanned 
months to years post-injury10, 11, 13. However, these studies typically found elevated FA and reduced MD, which is 
opposite to the present findings, suggesting that different neurobiological processes may predominate at the time 
of medical clearance, compared to long-term effects associated with a history of concussion.
The resting-state fMRI analyses showed elevated Gconn for concussed athletes relative to matched controls, 
at both acute injury and RTP. These findings are aligned with a prior resting-state fMRI study of the long-term 
effects of concussion28, which found elevated functional connectivity among athletes with a greater number of 
prior concussions, including the parietal and inferior frontal regions identified in this paper. The increased func-
tional connectivity seen at both acute injury and RTP has been previously observed in various forms of neurolog-
ical insult, including stroke and more severe brain injury29, which suggests that this may be a consistent functional 
brain response to neural injury. Elevated functional connectivity may a consequence of neurometabolic dys-
function, which occurs after a concussive impact30. Alternatively, it has been proposed that elevated functional 
integration reflects a greater redundancy in brain function and may serve as a protective mechanism following 
traumatic injury29. The present findings may therefore reflect an adaptive response to injury, which would help to 
maintain function and mitigate negative outcomes if a second injury is acquired during recovery from the initial 
concussion.
Altered brain function in dorsal brain regions has been previously reported for a range of traumatic brain 
injury severities27, 29. The parietal and angular gyri identified in Fig. 3 are critical for visual and sensory integra-
tion, while the inferior frontal lobe plays a role in cognitive control, including task switching and response inhi-
bition31, 32. In addition, the middle temporal gyri showed altered connectivity for concussed athletes; this region 
is implicated in semantic functions, including the processing of action knowledge33. Dysfunction in these regions 
is especially concerning, as deficits in visual integration and response are common sequelae of concussion2 and 
the proper functioning of these domains is critical for athletes to avoid re-injury during active sport participation. 
This is particularly important, as there is literature evidence of more severe consequences associated with a sec-
ond concussion, if it occurs within a fixed time-window after the initial injury34.
The localization of both DTI and fMRI changes to the dorsal part of the brain provide greater support for 
our findings and suggests a common (or strongly linked) process of brain change. However, the correlation of 
changes in Gconn with time to RTP indicates that this marker of brain function is more strongly linked to clinical 
recovery than the DTI measures, with longer recovery time and more persistent symptoms being correlates of 
hyper-connectivity. Interestingly, the association with days to RTP was primarily observed in regions implicated 
in sensorimotor function, indicating that altered connectivity in these regions may be a specific marker of pro-
longed recovery for athletes with concussion.
Although the current findings provide strong evidence of ongoing brain recovery at RTP, there are a few issues 
which should be addressed in future work. Athletes post-injury were compared to a sample of matched controls, 
however, they would ideally be compared to their un-injured baseline MRI scan. Nonetheless, the current proto-
col of individually matching controls to concussed athletes provides a relatively strong comparison. The persis-
tence of differences in brain structure and function at RTP also raises the question of when these differences are 
expected to dissipate. Thus, it will be crucial for future studies to examine within-subject changes in the months to 
years following symptom resolution, to determine if, and when, functional and structural markers of concussion 
have dissipated. In addition, there is growing literature evidence showing significant sex differences in concussion 
incidence and clinical outcomes35, 36. While this study shows robust neuroimaging findings for combined male 
and female athlete groups, future research should also examine whether there is a neuroimaging basis for the 
observed sex differences in concussion outcome.
The present work reports the first evidence of ongoing brain changes in athletes with concussion at the time 
of clinical recovery. These findings significantly extend our understanding of the pathophysiology of concus-
sion, and help to motivate future work investigating brain changes relative to the time of symptom resolution. 
Ultimately, pursuing this avenue of neuroimaging research may lead to refinements in concussion management 
strategies to minimize the potential risk of re-injury for athletes recovering from concussion.
Materials and Methods
Study participants. 
Fifty-four (54) athletes were recruited from interuniversity teams at a single institution 
(including volleyball, hockey, soccer, football, rugby, basketball and lacrosse). Twenty-seven (27) athletes were 
recruited following a physician diagnosis of concussion. Formal physician evaluation for suspected concussion 
was aligned with the standardized framework set forth by the Concussion in Sport Group2, for events where ath-
letes sustained direct or indirect contact to head with the presence of signs and/or symptoms. Concussed athletes 
were scanned at two time-points: the acute phase post-injury (1–7 days post-injury) and following medical clear-
ance to return to play (RTP). Acute imaging was conducted a median of 4 days post-injury, while RTP imaging

was conducted a median of 7 days post-clearance. Medical clearance to RTP was determined by normal Sport 
Concussion Assessment Tool 3 (SCAT3) scores, along with successful completion of both a graded exercise proto-
col consistent with consensus guidelines2 and a computerized cognitive screening battery. Demographic and clin-
ical information were also collected, including prior concussion history. For comparison, 27 control athletes were 
also imaged who had no concussions within the preceding 6 months. Controls were exactly matched on sex and 
presence of multiple prior concussions, and showed no significant difference in age (mean difference: 0.15 ± 1.03; 
p = 0.59, paired Wilcoxon test). Two athletes with concussion were not imaged at RTP due to drop-out, while 
one athlete was scanned at RTP but did not have acute imaging, leaving 24 athletes with complete acute and RTP 
scans. The study procedures were approved by research ethics boards (REBs) at the University of Toronto and St. 
Michael’s Hospital, carried out in accordance with REB guidelines, and all patients provided written informed 
consent prior to study participation.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging. 
Participants were imaged at St. Michael’s Hospital, using an MRI system 
operating at 3 Tesla (Magnetom Skyra, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with the standard 20-channel head receiver 
coil. Anatomical imaging included a T1-weighted Magnetization Prepared Rapid Acquisition Gradient Echo 
(MPRAGE) sequence. Participants were also imaged with structural sequences including fluid attenuated inver-
sion recovery imaging (FLAIR) and susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) to identify any structural abnormali-
ties, including lesions and micro-hemorrhage. DTI and fMRI sequences were acquired afterwards. During fMRI 
acquisition, participants were instructed to lie still with their eyes closed, and not focus on anything in particular. 
The eyes closed condition was employed in this group particularly to avoid confounds or compliance issues asso-
ciated acute concussion, such as photosensitivity and post-concussion headache.

of eddy currents and rigid-body motion correction, FSL bet was used to mask out non-brain voxels, and FSL

Diffusion-weighted brain maps was based on the FSL FDT protocol, described as follows: (1) masked subject 
FA maps were eroded by 1 voxel width at brain edges, and co-registered to the FMRIB58 template (1 mm3) via 
affine transform, using FSL flirt. Afterwards, (2) a symmetric, study-specific template was computed by averaging 
transformed subject FA maps, then re-averaging with flipped left/right orientations. This was repeated with (3) 
the average template as a reference and non-linear registration of FA maps using FSL fnirt, which was then used 
to update the study-specific template. This step was repeated once more, by (4) performing nonlinear registration 
and updating the mean template. Prior to analysis, all images were convolved with a 6 mm FWHM 3D Gaussian 
kernel to minimize the effects of local variation in white matter structure. All analyses were performed within a 
mask of regions with mean FA > 0.25, to focus on effects primarily within white matter tracts.
Brain Function. Resting-state fMRI data were obtained via multi-slice T2*-weighted echo planar imag-
ing (FOV = 20 ×

 4.5 mm voxels, BW = 2232 Hz/Pixel, TE/
TR = 30/2000, FA = 70°, oblique axial interleaved) to produce a time-series of 193 samples images. Subsequent 
data processing and analysis were performed using software from the Analysis of Functional Neuroimages 
(AFNI) package (afni.nimh.nih.gov) and customized algorithms developed in the laboratory. This included 
rigid-body motion correction (AFNI 3dvolreg), removal of outlier scan volumes (using nitrc.org/projects/spike-
cor), slice-timing correction (AFNI 3dTshift), spatial smoothing with a 6 mm Full Width at Half Maximum 
(FWHM) isotropic 3D Gaussian kernel (AFNI 3dmerge), regression of motion parameters and linear-quadratic 
trends as nuisance covariates. To control for physiological noise due to heartbeat and respiration, data-driven 
physiological correction was performed (via nitrc.org/projects/phycaa_plus), along with regression of white mat-
ter signal, by segmenting the brain with the FSL fast algorithm and regressing out the mean signal in white matter 
voxels with P > 0.95. Co-registration of fMRI data was obtained by computing the rigid-body transform of the 
time averaged fMRI data for each participant to their T1-weighted anatomical image, and the 12-parameter affine 
transformation of the anatomical image for each participant to the MNI152 template. The transformation matri-
ces were concatenated and the net transform applied to all fMRI data, resampled at 2 ×
 2 ×
 2 mm3 resolution.
Demographics and clinical data. 
The SCAT3 scores were compared at each post-concussion time-point, 
relative to both baseline test scores and the test scores of the matched controls, using non-parametric paired 
Wilcoxon tests. Uncorrected p-values were reported, along with significant differences after correcting for multi-
ple comparisons at a False Discovery Rate (FDR) of 0.05.
Neuroimaging data: from acute injury to RTP. 
Multivariate Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis was 
performed for each of the MRI measures (FA, MD, Gconn), to identify patterns of significant covariation between 
groups37–39. For each MRI measure, a mean-centered task PLS analysis was performed on the mean brain patterns 
for (1) matched controls and athletes with concussion at (2) acute injury and (3) RTP. Each PLS analysis produced

paired components, including a “voxel salience” map reflecting brain regions that showed greatest covariation 
across groups, and a set of “group saliences”
, reflecting how much each group expressed this brain pattern. The 
first PLS component is reported for each of the analyzed MRI measures, which explains the greatest total covar-
iance across groups.
Repeated-measures bootstrap resampling was used to generate empirical distributions on the PLS com-
ponent (1000 iterations), with resampling units consisting of a subject’s acute and RTP scans, along with their 
matched control. The effect size for voxel saliences was expressed as the bootstrap ratio of each variable (mean/
standard error), corrected for multiple comparisons by applying a voxel-level threshold at p = 0.005, followed 
by cluster-size thresholding using Analysis of Functional Neuroimages (AFNI; afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni) program 
3dFWHMx to estimate spatial smoothness and 3dClustSim to identify the minimum cluster size at an adjusted 
α
 = 0.05 significance. All brain maps are shown as a set of maximum intensity projections (MIPs) in each imaging 
plane, centered on the MNI coordinates (x = 8, y = −
14, z = 6). In addition, the mean MRI measure (FA, MD or 
Gconn) was computed over significant brain voxels for each subject, and the distribution of these values plotted 
for each group. To ascertain which groups showed significant differences in expression of MRI measures, boot-
strapped p-values were computed on the difference in group saliences between each pair of sport groups, with 
significant differences reported after adjusting at a FDR of 0.05.
Neuroimaging data: effects of recovery time. 
An additional analysis was conducted to determine 
whether changes in the brain are correlated with the time interval from injury to medical clearance. For each 
MRI measure, this was done by computing the within-subject paired difference in MRI values (RTP – acute) at 
each voxel, and performing ordinary least-squares regression against the total number of days from concussion 
to RTP. For consistency with the PLS analysis described above, results were evaluated via bootstrap resampling 
on subjects (1000 iterations), and the significance of voxel-wise regression coefficients was evaluated based on the 
bootstrap ratio. The same multiple comparison correlation was applied as above, by adjusting to a cluster-wise 
significant of α
 = 0.05.
