 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY  51:  405-413,  2017
Abstract. In May 2011 the International Agency for Research 
on Cancer (IARC) evaluated cancer risks from radiofre-
quency (RF) radiation. Human epidemiological studies gave 
evidence of increased risk for glioma and acoustic neuroma. 
RF radiation was classified as Group 2B, a possible human 
carcinogen. Further epidemiological, animal and mechanistic 
studies have strengthened the association. In spite of this, 
in most countries little or nothing has been done to reduce 
exposure and educate people on health hazards from RF 
radiation. On the contrary ambient levels have increased. 
In 2014 the WHO launched a draft of a Monograph on RF 
fields and health for public comments. It turned out that five 
of the six members of the Core Group in charge of the draft 
are affiliated with International Commission on Non-Ionizing 
Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), an industry loyal NGO, and 
thus have a serious conflict of interest. Just as by ICNIRP, 
evaluation of non-thermal biological effects from RF radiation 
are dismissed as scientific evidence of adverse health effects in 
the Monograph. This has provoked many comments sent to the 
WHO. However, at a meeting on March 3, 2017 at the WHO 
Geneva office it was stated that the WHO has no intention to 
change the Core Group.

1. Introduction
The use of wireless digital technology has grown rapidly 
during the last couple of decades (http://www.itu.int/en/
ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/facts/ICTFactsFigures2016.pdf). 
During use, mobile phones and cordless phones emit radio-
frequency (RF) radiation. The brain is the main target organ 
for RF emissions from the handheld wireless phone (1,2). 
An evaluation of the scientific evidence on the brain tumour 
risk was made in May 2011 by the International Agency for 
Research on Cancer (IARC) at the World Health Organization 
(WHO). IARC is independently financed and has its own 
governing and scientific councils, which WHO staff only 
attend as observers (http://www.who.int/ionizing_radiation/
research/iarc/en/).
Epidemiological studies provided supportive evidence 
of increased risk for head and brain tumours, i.e., acoustic 
neuroma and glioma. The working group reached the conclu-
sion that RF radiation from devices that emit non-ionizing 
RF radiation in the frequency range 30 kHz-300 GHz, is a 
Group 2B, i.e. a ‘possible’, human carcinogen (3,4). Later 
studies have corroborated these findings and have thus 
strengthened the evidence (5-8).
Several laboratory studies have indicated mechanisms of 
action for RF radiation carcinogenesis such as on DNA repair, 
oxidative stress, down regulation of mRNA and DNA damage 
with single strand breaks (9-13). A report was released from 
The National Toxicology Program (NTP) under the National 
Institutes of Health (NIH) in USA on the largest ever animal 
study on cell phone RF radiation and cancer (14). An increased 
incidence of glioma in the brain and malignant schwannoma 
in the heart was found in rats. Acoustic neuroma or vestibular 
schwannoma is a similar type of tumour as the one found in 
the heart, although benign. Thus, this animal study supported 
human epidemiological findings on RF radiation and brain 
tumour risk (8).
The IARC cancer classification includes all sources of 
RF radiation. The exposure from mobile phone base stations, 
Wi-Fi access points, smart phones, laptops and tablets can be 
long-term, sometimes around the clock, both at home and at 
World Health Organization, radiofrequency radiation 
and health - a hard nut to crack (Review)

school. For children this risk may be accentuated because of a 
cumulative effect during a long lifetime use (15). Developing 
and immature cells can also be more sensitive to exposure to 
RF radiation (9).
In spite of the IARC evaluation little has happened 
to reduce exposure to RF fields in most countries. On the 
contrary, with new technology increasing environmental 
exposure levels are found as in measurements of ambient RF 
radiation at e.g. Stockholm Central Station and Stockholm 
Old Town in Sweden (16,17). The exposure guideline used by 
many agencies was established in 1998 by the International 
Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection 
(ICNIRP) and was based only on established short-term 
thermal (heating) effects from RF radiation neglecting non-
thermal biological effects (18). The heating effects arise 
when radiation is so high that it warms up the whole body 
by 1˚C or more after 30 min exposure at 4 W/kg specific 
absorption rate. The guidelines are set with a safety factor of 
50 for the general public (http://www.who.int/peh-emf/about/
WhatisEMF/en/index4.html).
Basis for limiting exposure according to ICNIRP: ‘Only 
established effects were used as the basis for the proposed 
exposure restrictions. Induction of cancer from long-term 
EMF exposure was not considered to be established, and so 
these guidelines are based on short-term, immediate health 
effects such as stimulation of peripheral nerves and muscles, 
shocks and burns caused by touching conducting objects, 
and elevated tissue temperatures resulting from absorption 
of energy during exposure to EMF. In the case of potential 
long-term effects of exposure, such as an increased risk of 
cancer, ICNIRP concluded that available data are insuf-
ficient to provide a basis for setting exposure restrictions, 
although epidemiological research has provided suggestive, 
but unconvincing, evidence of an association between possible 
carcinogenic effects.’ (http://www.icnirp.org/cms/upload/
publications/ICNIRPemfgdl.pdf).
This is an exceptional statement by ICNIRP, and found in 
many statements of groups following the ICNIRP philosophy 
like the AGNIR and on the WHO EMF Project's homepage as 
well, that epidemiology found ‘suggestive, but unconvincing’ 
evidence. What is convincing or not is so decidedly subjective 
that no scientific body will ever make this as a basis for a deci-
sion. There might be gaps in knowledge that make it difficult 
to decide about the mechanisms that underlie an observation 
and even an observation could be considered unreliable but 
the conviction must not enter a rational discourse about a 
scientific issue.
The guidelines were updated in 2009 but still do not cover 
cancer and other long-term or non-thermal health effects. 
ICNIRP gives the guideline 2 to 10 W/m2 for RF radiation 
depending on frequency, thus only based on a short-term 
immediate thermal effect (19). ICNIRP is a private organisa-
tion (NGO) based in Germany. New expert members can only 
be elected by members of ICNIRP. Many of ICNIRP members 
have ties to the industry that is dependent on the ICNIRP 
guidelines. The guidelines are of huge economic and strategic 
importance to the military, telecom/IT and power industry.
In contrast to ICNIRP, the BioInitiative Reports from 2007 
and updated in 2012, based the evaluation also on non-thermal 
health effects from RF radiation (20,21). The scientific 
benchmark for possible health risks was defined to be 30 to 
60 µW/m2. Thus, using the significantly higher guideline by 
ICNIRP gives a ‘green card’ to roll out the wireless digital 
technology thereby not considering non-thermal health effects 
from RF radiation. Numerous health hazards are disregarded 
such as cancer (8), effects on neurotransmitters and neuropro-
tection (22,23), blood-brain-barrier (24,25), cognition (26-29), 
psychological addiction (30-32), sleep (33-36), behavioral 
problems (37-41) and sperm quality (13,42,43).
No doubt the IARC decision started a world-wide spinning 
machine to question the evaluation. It was similar to the one 
launched by the tobacco industry when IARC was studying and 
evaluating passive smoking as a carcinogen in the 1990s (44). 
Sowing confusion and manufacturing doubt about scientific 
facts is a well-known strategy used by the tobacco and other 
industries (8,45-48).
2. The WHO fact sheet
A Fact Sheet from WHO issued in June 2011 shortly after the 
IARC cancer classification in May 2011 stated that ‘To date, no 
adverse health effects have been established as being caused 
by mobile phone use’ (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/fact-
sheets/fs193/en/). This statement was not based on scientific 
evidence at that time on a carcinogenic effect from RF radia-
tion. It was certainly a remarkable conclusion by WHO since 
IARC is part of WHO although seemingly independent, see 
above.
However, it is also important to note that the statement in 
the Fact Sheet does not fully contradict the IARC statement. A 
Group 2B carcinogen is considered by IARC as an agent where 
an association with cancer has been detected that can be caus-
ally interpreted but for which chance, bias and confounding 
cannot be ruled out with sufficient scientific certainty. Hence, 
the statement in the Fact Sheet is in line with IARC's clas-
sification although, of course, it will rather be understood as a 
full dismissal of claims of harm.
In the WHO Fact Sheet it was also stated that ‘WHO will 
conduct a formal risk assessment of all studied health outcomes 
from radiofrequency fields exposure by 2012.’ The pertinent 
question is why WHO was so keen to make a new risk evalua-
tion shortly after the IARC evaluation. It was hardly expected 
that new studies would be published in short time changing the 
classification of RF radiation as a possible, Group 2B, human 
carcinogen. Considering the WHO statement of ‘no adverse 
health effects’ the aim might have been to undermine the 
IARC decision and give the telecom industry a ‘clean bill’ of 
health (8). It might, however, be argued that as a result of the 
IARC classification, it was necessary for WHO to also look at 
other effects, and not just tumours.
3. The WHO EMF project
The biophysicist Michael Repacholi from Australia was the 
first chairman of ICNIRP in 1992. His own research within 
this field is scanty, although a study on lymphoma incidence in 
mice exposed to RF radiation published in 1997 has attracted 
interest (49). Repacholi suggested in 1995 that WHO should 
start the EMF project. This was adopted by WHO in 1996, see 
WHO Press office: WHO launches new international project 
 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY  51:  405-413,  2017
407
to assess health effects of electric and magnetic fields; 4 June 
1996 (50). Repacholi was during 1996-2006 the leader of the 
WHO department of electromagnetic radiation, the WHO 
EMF project.
The WHO EMF project is supposed to: 1) provide infor-
mation on the management of EMF protection programs for 
national and other authorities, including monographs on EMF 
risk perception, communication and management; 2) provide 
advice to national authorities, other institutions, the general 
public and workers, about any hazards resulting from EMF 
exposure and any needed mitigation measures. (http://www.
who.int/peh-emf/project/EMF_Project/en/index1.html).
Michael Repacholi immediately set up a close collaboration 
between WHO and ICNIRP (being head of both organizations) 
inviting the electric, telecom and military industries to meet-
ings. He also arranged for large part of the WHO EMF project 
to be financed by the telecommunication industry's lobbying 
organisations; GSM Association and Mobile Manufacturers 
Forum, now called Mobile & Wireless Forum (MWF) (51) in 
addition to WHO, see the International EMF Project, Progress 
Report June 2005-2006 (http://www.who.int/peh-emf/publi-
cations/reports/IAC_Progress_Report_2005-2006.pdf).
Repacholi acted like a representative for the telecom 
industry while responsible for the EMF health effects 
department at the WHO (http://microwavenews.com/news/
time-stop-who-charade). Since he left WHO in 2006 he has 
been involved in industry propaganda video interviews with 
GSM Association and Hydro Quebec (https://www.youtube.
com/watch?v=fDZx7MphDjQ; https://www.youtube.com/
watch?v=1MI_fa5YsgY) where he clearly speaks in favor of 
the telecommunications and the power industries, respectively.
Michael Repacholi is still the Chairman emeritus at ICNIRP 
(http://www.icnirp.org/en/about-icnirp/emeritus-members/
index.html) and has propagated during almost 20 years world-
wide the ‘only thermal effect’ paradigm of health risks from 
RF-EMF exposure, ignoring the abundant evidence for non-
thermal effects or cancer risks.
Repacholi recruited Emilie van Deventer to the WHO 
EMF Project in 2000. She is the current project manager 
at WHO for the EMF project. She has been a long time 
member of the industry dominated organization Institute of 
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). IEEE is the 
world's most powerful federation of engineers. The members 
are or have been employed in companies or organizations 
that are producers or users of technologies that depend on 
radiation frequencies, such as power companies, the telecom 
and the military industry. IEEE has prioritized international 
lobbying efforts for decades especially aimed at the WHO, 
for more information see (http://www.ices-emfsafety.
org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Approved-Minutes-
TC95-Jan_16.pdf).
Van Deventer is an electrical engineer. She has no formal 
or earlier knowledge in medicine, epidemiology or biology, 
so it is surprising that she was selected for such an impor-
tant position at the WHO (http://www.waves.utoronto.ca/
people_vandeventer.htm) (http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/worksem/
emc-emf/201107/bios.html).
The very same year she was recruited to the WHO EMF 
Project Toronto University Magazine wrote about Emilie van 
Deventer's work stating that it was ‘invaluable’ to industry: 
‘The software modelling done by teams like van Deventer's 
is invaluable.’ ‘The industrial community is very interested in 
our research capabilities,’ says van Deventer. ‘It always needs 
to be working on the next generation of products, so it turns 
to universities to get the research done.’ (http://www.research.
utoronto.ca/edge/fall2000/content2b.html).
The importance of this work is reflected in the research 
funding van Deventer and her team received from the 
Natural Sciences & Engineering Research Council of Canada 
(NSERC), Communications & Information Technology 
Ontario (CITO), and their major industrial partner, Nortel. ‘We 
are fulfilling a very real need in the industry today, which will 
only increase as technology creates more opportunity. In the 
process, consumers will continue to enjoy faster computers, 
lighter cell phones, smaller electronic organizers and the 
vast array of other electronic gadgets the high-tech world 
has to offer.’ (http://www.research.utoronto.ca/edge/edgenet/
fall2000/a-clear-signal/).
4. WHO radio frequency fields: Environmental health 
criteria monograph
Two years after the anticipated ‘formal risk assessment’ by 
WHO in 2012 a draft was launched in 2014 (http://www.
who.int/peh-emf/research/rf_ehc_page/en/). It was open for 
public consultation until December 31, 2014, but is now closed 
according to the WHO home page.
It was stated that: ‘The process used in developing the 
chapters is described in Appendix X. Note that the chapters 
1, 13 and 14 which will provide a summary, health risk 
assessment and protective measures are not available for this 
consultation. The drawing of conclusions from the literature 
and the drafting of these chapters is the remit of a formal Task 
Group that will be convened by WHO at a later stage in the 
process.’
It must be regarded to be unusual and scientifically inad-
equate not to provide for review the health risk assessment 
and protective measures which would be most important parts 
of the Monograph. Furthermore, it turned out that of the six 
members in the WHO Core Group four are active members 
of ICNIRP and one is a former member. This was published 
in 2016 (52) and also discussed more recently (8). Only one 
person seems to be independent of ICNIRP, see Table I. 
Several persons have also affiliation(s) to other advisory 
groups, authorities and/or committees. Six of the 20 additional 
experts are affiliated with ICNIRP.
Being a member of ICNIRP is a conflict of interest in 
the scientific evaluation of health hazards from RF radiation 
through ties to military and industry. This is particularly true 
since the ICNIRP guidelines are of huge importance to the 
influential telecommunications, military and power industries. 
Another conflict of interest is for members officially assessing 
possible health effects below their own set ICNIRP guidelines, 
which they have already stated as beeing safe, see also discus-
sion in (52). Such persons would hardly have different opinions 
than those stated by ICNIRP. Critical views are not heard and 
a balanced scientific evaluation is not obtained.
It should be noted that the Ethical Board at the Karolinska 
Institute in Stockholm, Sweden concluded already in 2008 that 
being a member of ICNIRP may be a conflict of interest that 
 HARDELL:  WHO MONOGRAPH ICNIRP
408
should be stated officially whenever a member from ICNIRP 
makes opinions on health risks from EMF (Karolinska Institute 
diary number: 3753-2008-609). No statement of such conflict 
of interest can be found in the WHO draft of the Monograph 
on RF radiation.
Several persons and groups have sent critical comments 
to WHO on the many shortcomings in the draft of the 
Monograph on RF fields. In general WHO has not responded 
to these comments and it is unclear to what extent, if any, 
they are considered. Due to the short time for submission our 
(Lennart Hardell, Michael Carlberg) comments related only to 
section 12.1 Cancer Epidemiology. Our concluding remarks 
dated December 15, 2014 were: ‘In conclusion the WHO draft 
is biased towards the null results. Findings on an association 
between use of wireless phones (mobile phones and cordless 
phones) and increased risk for brain tumours are misinter-
preted, selectively reported and/or omitted in total. The draft 
cannot be used as science-based evaluation of increased risk. 
It needs to be re-written in a balanced way by scientists trained 
in epidemiology and oncology, not the least in medicine, and 
without conflicts of interest.’
Moreover, after the formal closing date for comments 
on the Monograph several additional submissions have been 
made to WHO. Professor Michael Kundi at Center for Public 
Health, Institute of Environmental Health, Vienna, Austria 
stated in his summary dated January 12, 2015: ‘I was only 
able to check chapter 12 about cancer and only the epide-
miological studies. While the EHC (Environmental Health 
Criteria) team did a great job in allocating the relevant 
literature with only few more recent papers missing, I'm not 
fully satisfied with the assessment of the evidence. There is 
a striking imbalance in the comments made on studies that 
were positive in contrast to those that were negative. Only 
the most obvious shortcomings of studies that didn't report 
an effect of exposure are mentioned while positive findings 
are often discussed at length, sometimes with very far-fetched 
assumptions about potential sources of bias. This is in marked 
contrast to other EHC monographs that are discussing the 
evidence in a way not to overlook a potential harmful effect. 
My comments, giving reference to the lines of the draft are 
detailed on the following pages.’
The BioInitiative Working Group issued December 19, 
2016 a ‘No Confidence’ Letter to the WHO EMF Program 
Manager: ‘The BioInitiative Working Group urges the World 
Health Organization to make changes to the WHO RF EHC 
Core Group membership to more fairly reflect membership 
and expertise of the 2011 IARC RF Working Group. At 
present, the WHO RF EHC Core Group is indistinguishable 
from ICNIRP... undermining credibility of the process and 
ensuring doubt about conclusions... Even if schedule delays 
occur as a result, an acceptable outcome depends on public 
confidence. There [are] now many thousands of high quality 
scientific papers indicating possible non-thermal RF risks to 
health and those experts most competent by virtue of their 
research contributions are absent from this process... Both 
human and animal results are now available to incorporate 
in the RF EHC risk assessment. This important effort can 
only be assured with a more balanced composition of core 
participants in the process. As well, the membership needs 
to be inclusive of under-represented countries such as Russia, 
China, India, Turkey, and Iran whose research communities 
have produced the majority of studies on non-thermal effects 
of RF in recent years.’ (http://www.bioinitiative.org/report/
wp-content/uploads/2016/12/BIWG-final-draft-WHO-RF-
EHC-Monograph-team-composition.pdf).
This letter was followed by another from the BioInitiative 
Working Group on January 24, 2017 including suggestion 
of experts to replace present persons in the Core Group 
and Additional Experts: ‘We have not yet received a reply 
acknowledging our letter... It is important that the most 
knowledgeable panel of experts be appointed to prepare 
the RF EHC Monograph. At present, the EHC Core Group 
members uniformly represent attitudes and scientific positions 
of ICNIRP, an organization whose membership has steadfastly 
refused to accept new scientific evidence of potential health 
risks from non-thermal, low-intensity radiofrequency radiation 
despite recent scientific advances in knowledge on the subject. 
We are recommending substitutions for membership as indi-
cated on the attached page. Please note that we are suggesting 
a complete replacement for those persons currently holding 
positions.’ (http://www.bioinitiative.org/report/wp-content/
uploads/2017/01/BIWG-EHC-substitution-letter.pdf).

from 41 nations: ‘We are scientists engaged in the study of 
biological and health effects of non-ionizing electromagnetic 
fields (EMF)... Effects include increased cancer risk, cellular 
stress, increase in harmful free radicals, genetic damages, 
structural and functional changes of the reproductive system, 
learning and memory deficits, neurological disorders, and 
negative impacts on general well-being in humans. Damage 
goes well beyond the human race, as there is growing 
evidence of harmful effects to both plant and animal life. 
These findings justify our appeal to the United Nations (UN) 
and, all member States in the world, to encourage the World 
Health Organization (WHO) to exert strong leadership in 
fostering the development of more protective EMF guide-
lines, encouraging precautionary measures, and educating 
the public about health risks, particularly risk to children 
and fetal development. By not taking action, the WHO is 
failing to fulfil its role as the preeminent international public 
health agency.’ (https://www.emfscientist.org/index.php/emf-
scientist-appeal).
A press release was issued on February 24, 2017 by the 
European coordination of organizations for an EMF exposure 
regulation which truly protects public health. The European 
citizens' organizations failed, however, to include in their 
letter the conflict of interest associated with ICNIRP members 
assessing possible effects below set ICNIRP guidelines, see 
discussion above. They stated that: ‘The Conflict of Interest 
Scandal is repeating itself in the WHO: European citizens' 
organizations uncover conflicts of interest between the health 
and radiofrequency WHO expert group and telecommunica-
tions or electric companies. Almost 40 organizations and 
European Platforms (which in turn include many regional, 
national or local social organizations), supported by the 
International EMF Alliance (IEMFA), denounce the flagrant 
conflict of interest of the Core Group of experts for drafting, 
in the current year, of a WHO Environmental Health Criteria 
Monograph on Radio-Frequency Fields...
The preponderant presence of members of the International 
Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) 
reminds us that this organization (and other institutions with 
the same criteria) refused to accept new scientific evidence 
of potential health risks from non-thermal, low-intensity 
radiofrequency radiation despite recent scientific advances 
in knowledge on the subject. The ICNIRP not only does 
not guarantee transparency or independence but conflicts 
of interest of its members are well known and reported, due 
to their relationships with telecommunications or electric 
companies, thereby undermining the impartiality that should 
govern the regulation of Public Exposure Standards for non-
ionizing radiation... By not taking action, the WHO is failing 
to fulfill its role as the preeminent international public health 
agency...’ (http://www.peccem.org/DocumentacionDescarga/

Letter dated March 1, 2017 from Russian National 
Committee on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection to Maria 
Neira, Director, Public Health and Environment with copy to 
Dr. E. van Deventer, Public Health and Environment, WHO: ‘It 
has just come to our attention that the WHO RF Working group 
consists mainly from present and past ICNIRP members. In 
general, the WG is not balanced and... the private self-elected 
organization ICNIRP, similar as majority of the current 
WHO RF WG members, does not recognize the non-thermal

5. Human Health Effects of Non-Ionizing Radiation - 
Informal meeting at WHO March 3, 2017
It is quite obvious that it would be of utmost value to learn 
what is on-going at WHO regarding the Monograph on RF 
radiation, especially since formal responses to submissions 
with comments are virtually absent. Thus, some 9 months 
after initial contact Dr Maria Neira accepted to organize a 
meeting, relating to the effects of electromagnetic fields on 
health, in her office at WHO in Geneva. The request for a 
meeting was made by independent researchers from different 
universities. An informal meeting was organized on March 3, 
2017. (http://eceri-institute.org/fichiers/1490952497_news-
letter_ECERI_5.pdf).
Dr Maria Neira is Director of the Public Health and the 
Environment Department at WHO. Present at the meeting was 
also Dr Emilie van Deventer, the Team Leader of the Radiation 
Programme at WHO which deals with non-ionizing and 
ionizing radiation topics related to human health. She has been 
working at WHO since 2000 where she heads the International 
EMF Project, the Ultraviolet INTERSUN Programme and 
the International Radon Project. Dr van Deventer received 
a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of 
Michigan, USA. She was adjunct professor of Electrical and 
Computer Engineering, financed by the telecom industry, at 
the University of Toronto in Canada from 1992 to 2000. She 
is the WHO Observer on the Main Commission of ICNIRP, 
e.g. participating in ICNIRP meetings. (http://www.itu.int/en/
ITU-T/Workshops-and-Seminars/emf/201307/Pages/vanDE-
VENTERTaheraEmilie.aspx). She is also one of 8 members of 
the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority (SSM).
The allocated time at the WHO office was 1.5 h. 
Dr Maria Neira opened the meeting stressing that it was not 
official but informal. She told that her department is very much 
interested in challenging science. In addition to myself, four 
additional experts were also present. The experts gave short 
presentations on health effects of RF radiation, biological 
effects from exposure to non-thermal RF radiation, overview 
of epidemiological studies on brain tumour risk, RF radia-
tion and electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS), and finally 
epigenetic mechanisms by which children are especially-
vulnerable to RF radiation. Obviously the five presentations 
were very short in order to give time for discussions, the most 
important part of the meeting.
The participating team of five experts with considerable 
knowledge and own research within this area offered to collab-
orate with WHO, especially to finalize the WHO Monograph 
on RF radiation. Maria Neira stated clearly that no collabora-
tion with WHO is to be considered, and further that she does 
not intend to have another meeting with the group. However,

she added that she is open to new data. She also said that there 
is no conflict of interest with ICNIRP since ICNIRP is a WHO 
collaborative organization. The scientific group, as above, was 
instead invited to send to WHO peer-reviewed publications, 
especially meta-analyses that would be the ‘best gift’.
It was stated by the WHO officials that ICNIRP is an NGO 
with an official relationship with WHO that ‘helps us a lot in our 
analyses’ and their members work as WHO's experts. Thus, in 
spite of five of six persons in the Core Group for the Monograph 
being affiliated with ICNIRP, WHO seems to have no intention 
to change these members. On the other hand, the Task Group is 
not finalized. According to the meeting all experts are selected 
on individual basis and not as members of ICNIRP. Further, 
it was stated that the WHO guideline documents are in full 
WHO's responsibility. It is not known when the Monograph on 
RF radiation will be published. WHO still ‘keeps looking at the 
evidence’ and is still adding new documents to the Monograph.
The decision by the Ethical Board at the Karolinska 
Institute in Stockholm, Sweden from 2008 that being a member 
of ICNIRP may be a conflict of interest that should be stated 
in scientific publications was brought into attention during the 
meeting. WHO was unaware of that document and promised to 
‘look into it’. Obviously that conflict of interest applies to almost 
the whole Core Group of the Monograph, several members of 
additional experts, not to say Emilie van Deventer and thus the 
whole WHO EMF project and the Monograph on RF radiation.
6. Exposure to RF radiation within the WHO building in 
Geneva
In our on-going project on measurements of ambient RF radia-
tion in some cities Geneva is part of the study. Results of parts 
of Stockholm, Sweden have been published (16,17) and will be 
used e.g. for comparison with levels in the future due to further 
development of this technology. In Geneva also measurements 
within the WHO building; main entrance, some corridors and 
the meeting room were included. These previously unpub-
lished results have been communicated to the representatives 
at WHO including that they will be published. There has been 
no reaction from the WHO.
An EME Spy 200 exposimeter with a valid calibration was 
used to collect the exposure data. The exposimeter measures 
20 predefined frequency bands that cover frequencies from 
88-5,850 MHz. The sampling time was every 4th sec which is 
the fastest for the given exposimeter, for further details see our 
publications. For frequency modulation (FM), TV3, TETRA, 
TV4&5, Wi-Fi 2G and Wi-Fi 5G, the lower detection limit is 
0.01 V/m (0.27 µW/m2); for all other bands, the lower detection 
limit is 0.005 V/m (0.066 µW/m2) (16,17).
The results, presented in Table II, show low mean total 
exposure level, 21.5 µW/m2, thus below the scientific benchmark 
of 30 to 60 µW/m2 that has been proposed to be the ‘lowest 
observed effect level’ (LOEL) for RF radiation, see Chapter 24

of the BioInitiative Report (21). Note that only for the mean 
it is possible to calculate the total as the sum of means of the 
individual frequency bands, mathematically this is not possible 
for median, min and max in Table Ⅱ. The major sources were 
GSM + UMTS 900 DL (3G), GSM 1800 DL (2G) and UMTS 
2100 DL (3G), i.e. downlink (DL) of RF radiation from outside 
base stations. The results for total exposure are also presented as 
box plot in Fig. 1. In Fig. 2 total exposure over time is presented. 
Almost all RF radiation was below 30 µW/m2, the LOEL of RF 
radiation for possible health risks as shown with the horizontal 
line. The highest peak level, 432.3 µW/m2, was measured 
at 15:54:07. Most contribution was from GSM 1800 (DL), 
268.2 µW/m2, and UMTS 2100 (DL), 110.4 µW/m2. This was 
measured just inside the building at the entrance and represent 
RF radiation from base stations in the vicinity.
The exposure to RF radiation within the WHO building is 
very low compared to other measurements, for example our 
measurements inside the Stockholm Central station where 
people both are passing through but also are there for hours 
each day such as security and police staff, cafe workers, 
shop workers, janitors, information counter people, etc., 
see Figs 3 and 4. Here, the mean total exposure for the lowest 
exposure round was 2,817 µW/m2, mostly from down loading 
from GSM, 3G and 4G base stations (16). Thus, the measured 
mean level in the WHO building is more than 130 times lower 
than in the Stockholm Central Station.
7. Concluding remarks
The meeting at WHO was an obvious disappointment. During 
the discussion the two WHO officials showed little interest 
to collaborate with the scientists convened at the meeting 
in spite of the scientific evidence on adverse health effects. 
Their in-house experts seem to be members of ICNIRP,

Switzerland. Box plot for total exposure in µW/m2, logarithmic scale. The 
median is indicated by a black line inside the box; the bottom and top of the 
boxes show first and third quartiles; the end of the whisker is calculated as 
1.5xIQR (interquartile range). Points represent outliers.

line represents the LOEL exposure limit of 30 µW/m2 suggested by the 
Bioinitiative Report (21).

30 µW/m2 suggested by the Bioinitiative Report (21).

although not exclusively. This may explain why only short-
term thermal effects from RF radiation are accepted as proofs 
of harm, and why non-thermal biological effects are ignored. 
In the draft of the Monograph a large bulk of peer-reviewed 
scientific publications on non-thermal effects are dismissed, 
c.f. as also by ICNIRP (19). Most remarkable is that WHO has 
no intention to replace the Core Group of experts affiliated 
with ICNIRP. Thereby ICNIRP is given full access to and 
exclusive possibilities to influence the Monograph. In view of 
the huge economic interests built into the ICNIRP guidelines, 
and several of its expert members' ties to industry, no doubt 
this is a large conflict of interest that will seriously undermine 
not only the credibility of the Monograph on RF radiation but 
also the credibility of WHO as a protector of world health. 
Seriously enough, the Monograph will be the hallmark for 
years to come on evaluation of health hazards from RF radia-
tion and pave the way for increasing exposure to RF radiation 
to people and environment, e.g. the fifth generation (5G), 
internet of things, etc.
Children and adolescents may be more sensitive to RF 
radiation than adults (2). Thus as an authoritative agency, 
WHO has an obligation to reference all the scientific research 
results and call the experts from all the related fields like engi-
neering, health and medicine to engage in the re-evaluation 
of all health effects including non-thermal of RF radiation. 
Related agencies should launch an objective and transparent 
project for this assessment. The EMF project was started 
many years ago and many new wireless digital technologies 
are developed and new devices are popularizing with a very 
fast speed.
Protests and comments by scientific experts and several 
organizations seem to be ignored. The Monograph might be 
political and industry supportive more than scientific and 
health promoting. For a definitive conclusion a more thor-
ough review of the whole draft document would be needed. 
By now it is time for laymen, NGOs and scientists to exert 
pressure on politicians to change the WHO agenda on RF 
radiation and health hazards and decide that WHO's purpose 
is to support world health instead of industry interests. 
It is also time to evaluate the competence of the persons 
making the evaluations and decisions before publishing the 
Monograph. Of note, evidence has been published (52) which 
indicated that members of ICNIRP have written scientifi-
cally incorrect and misleading information. It is unknown if 
WHO has responded to this evidence of suggested scientific 
misconduct.
To evaluate cancer risks it is necessary to include scien-
tists with competence in medicine, especially oncology. 
Furthermore, what are the personal advantages, at least in the 
short time, for those refusing to accept peer-reviewed scientific 
publications on adverse effects on health and environment 
from RF radiation? Ironically enough, whether knowingly or 
not, the WHO staff seems to protect themselves from high 
involuntary RF radiation levels at least in the measured areas 
within the Geneva building.
