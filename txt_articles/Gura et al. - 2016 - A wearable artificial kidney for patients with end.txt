Introduction
Worldwide, the prevalence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) treated with maintenance dialysis exceeds 
2 million individuals (1). These patients suffer from an exceptionally high burden of morbidity and mor-
tality. Adjusted rates of all-cause mortality are up to 8 times greater for dialysis patients compared with 
age-matched individuals in the general population (2–4). Current hemodialysis therapies require patients 
to adhere to restrictive dietary and fluid intake limitations and are associated with a high pill burden (5–
7). Recognition of these limitations has prompted a search for alternatives to conventional thrice-weekly 
hemodialysis that may improve patient-centered clinical outcomes, including survival, treatment burden, 
and quality of life. Accumulating evidence suggests that longer and/or more frequent dialysis may benefit 
patients through improvements in metabolic parameters, reduced left ventricular mass, and greater blood 
pressure control (8–14). However, current hemodialysis machines are stationary and as such substantially 
BACKGROUND. Stationary hemodialysis machines hinder mobility and limit activities of daily 
life during dialysis treatments. New hemodialysis technologies are needed to improve patient 
autonomy and enhance quality of life.
METHODS. We conducted a FDA-approved human trial of a wearable artificial kidney, a 
miniaturized, wearable hemodialysis machine, based on dialysate-regenerating sorbent technology. 
We aimed to determine the efficacy of the wearable artificial kidney in achieving solute, electrolyte, 
and volume homeostasis in up to 10 subjects over 24 hours.
RESULTS. During the study, all subjects remained hemodynamically stable, and there were no 
serious adverse events. Serum electrolytes and hemoglobin remained stable over the treatment 
period for all subjects. Fluid removal was consistent with prescribed ultrafiltration rates. Mean 
blood flow was 42 ± 24 ml/min, and mean dialysate flow was 43 ± 20 ml/min. Mean urea, 
creatinine, and phosphorus clearances over 24 hours were 17 ± 10, 16 ± 8, and 15 ± 9 ml/min, 
respectively. Mean β2-microglobulin clearance was 5 ± 4 ml/min. Of 7 enrolled subjects, 5 completed 
the planned 24 hours of study treatment. The trial was stopped after the seventh subject due to 
device-related technical problems, including excessive carbon dioxide bubbles in the dialysate 
circuit and variable blood and dialysate flows.
CONCLUSION. Treatment with the wearable artificial kidney was well tolerated and resulted in 
effective uremic solute clearance and maintenance of electrolyte and fluid homeostasis. These 
results serve as proof of concept that, after redesign to overcome observed technical problems, a 
wearable artificial kidney can be developed as a viable novel alternative dialysis technology.

limit freedom of movement of patients and their ability to engage in activities of daily living. Furthermore, 
functional capability after dialysis is frequently hindered by severe fatigue (15, 16). As a consequence, 
few patients undergoing maintenance dialysis are fully rehabilitated, leading to a high prevalence of poor 
health-related quality of life within this vulnerable population (17–19).
There is thus a critical unmet need for new dialysis technologies that offer patients an enhanced spec-
trum of choices and may address some of the key limitations of the current ESRD treatment paradigm. An 
alternative with the potential to improve on current hemodialysis technologies is a continuously operating 
and wearable artificial kidney (WAK) designed to provide continuous solute clearance and ultrafiltration 
capacity (20). We have previously described the development of such a device, which utilizes dialysate-re-
generating sorbent technology paired with a miniaturized, dual-channel, battery-operated, pulsatile pump 
for driving both blood and dialysate simultaneously (20). This pulsatile pump generates a unique flow pat-
tern that enhances convective transfer of solutes across the dialyzer membrane. Previous pilot studies of the 
WAK have demonstrated its short-term safety and efficacy in solute clearance and fluid removal but have 
been limited to treatment durations of less than 8 hours (21–23).
Here, we report the results of a 24-hour exposure of the WAK in humans. The primary goals of this 
study were to test the safety and efficacy of the WAK in achieving solute clearance, electrolyte homeostasis, 
and volume removal over a continuous 24-hour period. Additionally, we sought to evaluate treatment-re-
lated satisfaction and quality of life with the WAK and compare these ratings to those for conventional 
in-center hemodialysis treatments among patients exposed to the device.
Results
This was a prospective, nonrandomized, exploratory clinical trial (NCT02280005), in which up to 10 sub-
jects could receive therapy with the WAK for 24 hours while being monitored in a hospital setting. Devel-
opment of the WAK was supported via collaboration with the US FDA Center for Devices and Radiologi-
cal Health through its Innovation Pathway 2.0 (24).
Subject characteristics. Figure 1 depicts the flow of participants in the trial. Of 411 patients initially 
screened, 152 met study eligibility criteria (37%); of these, 24 were approached, and 11 (46%) consented 
to study participation. Table 1 shows the baseline demographic and laboratory data for all study subjects 
at the time of enrollment. Overall, the mean age was 49 years (range 27–73 years), 4 of the subjects were 
women, 3 had diabetes, and 3 had comorbid congestive heart failure. The average duration of maintenance 
hemodialysis prior to study enrollment was 15 months (range 3–41 months). Mean body mass index was 
24 (range 17–31).
Solute clearance, electrolyte, and volume homeostasis. Mean concentrations of serum electrolytes over the 
24-hour WAK treatment period remained stable (Table 2). Before starting treatment, mean serum potassium 
concentration was 3.8 ± 0.5 meq/l and serum phosphorus concentration was 3.1 ± 0.5 mg/dl. At the end of 
the 24-hour WAK treatment, these concentrations were 3.9 ± 0.4 meq/l and 3.9 ± 0.8 mg/dl, respectively (P 
= 0.01 for trend in serum phosphorus). During the study period, mean blood flow was 42 ± 24 ml/min and 
dialysate flow was 43 ± 20 ml/min, with a moderate decrease in blood flows at between 16 and 24 hours. 
Mean weighted-average concentrations of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were significantly lower during the 
24-hour WAK treatment relative to weighted-average concentrations from a 48-hour period before the WAK 
encompassing conventional hemodialysis treatments (17 ± 5 mg/dl versus 39 ± 18 mg/dl, P = 0.002) (Figure 
2). Similarly, mean β2-microglobulin concentrations were significantly lower during WAK treatment relative 
to periods of conventional hemodialysis therapy (17 ± 8 mg/l versus 22 ± 11 mg/l, P = 0.04).
Mean BUN, creatinine, and phosphorus clearances during the study period were 17 ± 10, 16 ± 8, 
and 15 ± 9 ml/min, respectively; mean β2-microglobulin clearance was 5 ± 4 ml/min (Figure 3). There 
was close concordance of blood-based and dialysate-based measurements of solute clearance (Figure 3 
and Supplemental Table 1; supplemental material available online with this article; doi:10.1172/jci.
insight.86397DS1), and there was a general moderate downward trend in clearance of all solutes over the 
24-hour study period that closely paralleled a downward trend in blood flow measurements (Figures 4 and 
5). Clearance of β2-microglobulin was consistently lower than clearance of small solutes, irrespective of 
study time point.
Of the 5 subjects who completed the planned 24-hour treatment period, mean 24-hour ultrafiltration 
volume was 1,002 ± 380 ml. Ultrafiltration was accomplished as intended, with a mean difference between 
prescribed and achieved ultrafiltration over the study period of 3 ± 15 ml. Mean systolic blood pressure

declined from 140 ± 23 mmHg at baseline to 127 ± 6 mmHg at the end of treatment, though this change 
was not statistically significant (Table 2). No subject was observed to have a systolic blood pressure of less 
than 100 mmHg during the WAK treatment period, and only 1 subject was observed to have a systolic 
blood pressure of less than 120 mmHg.
Device performance and technical complications. Over the course of the 24-hour study period, dialysis-re-
generating sorbents performed as expected, with no evidence of saturation with uremic solute (Supplemen-

tal Table 2). In 6 of the 7 subjects, no significant clotting was observed, and mean 24-hour unfractionated 
heparin administration among all subjects was 956 ± 218 units. In 1 subject, treatment was discontinued 
after 4 hours due to clotting of the blood circuit following ambulation. In a second subject, WAK treatment 
was discontinued after 10 hours due to observed pink discoloration of the dialysate. This occurred after 
dialysate circuit reconnection for standard saline rinse, and there was no laboratory evidence of hemolysis. 
Elevated ammonia levels at hour 11 were detected in the dialysis circuit after passing through the sorbent 
cartridge for 1 subject, requiring replacement of the sorbent cartridges. No evidence of sorbent column 
ammonia saturation was detected in the remaining subjects. For 2 subjects, replacement of the main lithi-
um ion battery was required prior to completion of the 24-hour treatment period. Removal of gas bubbles 
from the blood circuit was required in 3 study subjects. For these subjects, activation of the bubble detector 
on the venous limb of the blood circuit occurred early in the course of the WAK treatment period due 
to small bubbles that had likely remained in the dialyzer header following circuit priming. In each case, 
activation of the bubble detector sounded an audible alarm and automatically stopped the main shuttle 
pump. Study investigators then used a 3.0-ml lure-lock syringe to remove the bubbles using a venous limb 
sampling port prior to restarting the main pump. The trial was stopped after the seventh subject due to the 
cumulative occurrence of device-related technical problems, which included excessive carbon dioxide bub-
bles in the dialysate circuit, which exceeded degassing capacity, tubing kinks, and variable pump function, 
resulting in fluctuating blood and dialysate flow rates. A complete list of technical issues encountered and 
correction actions taken is detailed in Supplemental Table 3.
Adverse events and tolerability. There were no serious adverse events. Two subjects experienced mild mus-
cle cramping, which in one case resolved spontaneously and in the other case resolved with a reduction in 
the delivered ultrafiltration rate (Supplemental Table 4). One subject experienced a brief episode of nausea, 
and one had an episode of diarrhea on the day following WAK treatment. One subject experienced mod-
erate malaise after discontinuation of WAK treatment. This subject, who had an elevated white blood cell

count prior to WAK treatment, received a single prophylactic administration of intravenous antibiotics. 
No further antibiotics were administered, as blood cultures were negative for growth of bacterial or fungal 
organisms. Five subjects were noted to have premature ventricular contractions while monitored on con-
tinuous telemetry; there were no episodes of sustained atrial or ventricular arrhythmia. All 7 subjects were 
able to ambulate while receiving WAK treatment.
Treatment satisfaction and health-related quality of  life. Comparing treatment satisfaction with convention-
al hemodialysis therapy versus satisfaction with their experience using the WAK, subjects reported sig-
nificantly greater overall satisfaction with the WAK (P < 0.001). Individual Renal Treatment Satisfaction 
Questionnaire (RTSQ) item satisfaction scores were significantly higher for the WAK in 10 of 13 domains 
assessed, including satisfaction with treatment-related side effects, convenience and flexibility of treat-
ment, discomfort or pain involved with treatment, and satisfaction with freedom afforded by the treatment 
modality (Table 3).
Discussion
Under the auspices of the FDA Innovation Pathway 2.0, we completed an exploratory clinical trial of 
the WAK — a miniaturized, wearable hemodialysis system providing continuous solute clearance and 
volume removal capacity for patients with ESRD. During the study, hemodynamic parameters remained 
stable, ultrafiltration was achieved as intended, and there were no unexpected adverse treatment effects. 
Additionally, solute clearances were maintained over 24 hours and closely mirrored achieved blood flow. 
Acid-base and electrolyte homeostasis were maintained without restriction on patients’ dietary choices and 
without use of phosphorus-binding medications. Importantly, study subjects reported greater treatment 
satisfaction among multiple treatment-related domains with WAK treatment compared with conventional 
hemodialysis treatment. Furthermore, the ability to ambulate while undergoing dialysis, if further proven 
in additional studies, would liberate patients from the need to be tethered to a stationary machine during 
dialysis treatments. A variety of technical complications were observed in our study that will need to be 
addressed through device redesign and refinement to enhance device safety and reliability prior to further 
longer-term studies of the WAK in humans. However, our findings provide proof of concept that the WAK 
could be developed as a viable novel dialysis technology.
Efforts to develop a portable and wearable dialysis system date to the early 1970s, when Kolff and 
colleagues developed a wearable hemodialysis module that could be disconnected from an accompanying

20-liter dialysate bath for up to one-third of the 
cumulative dialysis time (25). This innovative device 
utilized a single needle, a dual-chamber pulsatile 
pump, and rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries 
and allowed clinician adjustments to blood flow and 
ultrafiltration rates. However, Kolff’s device suf-
fered from the absence of a full sorbent system, rely-
ing instead on a charcoal canister only for adsorp-
tion of filtered toxins, and additionally required 
patients to be tethered to a stationary dialysate bath 
for at least two-thirds of any dialysis session. Addi-
tional early efforts to design and build a wearable 
renal replacement system explored the possibility 
of utilizing hemofiltration technology alone, with-
out counter-current dialysate circulation, but were 
complicated in some cases by the need for patients 
to consume a large volume of replacement fluid, 
limiting practical application (26). The application 
of sorbent technology to a wearable hemodialysis 
system was initially proposed by Blumenkrantz 
and colleagues in the late 1970s as an extension of 
newly developed and commercially available dialy-
sate-regenerating sorbent systems (27). Subsequent-
ly, Murisasco and colleagues developed a wearable 
hemofiltration device utilizing sorbent-containing 
minicartridges to minimize the requirement for 
excessive intake of replacement fluid; but this sys-
tem required replacement of the minicartridges up 
to 4 times daily and further required patients to use 
transcutaneous arteriovenous shunts with conse-
quent risk for infection (28). These early technological innovations paved the way for the development of the 
WAK, which extends earlier efforts through incorporation of modern-day miniaturization technology, bio-
compatible dialyzer materials, battery design, and safety features. In addition to the WAK, the past decade 
has also seen efforts to design a number of other prototype next-generation wearable renal replacement 
therapies, which include wearable peritoneal dialysis systems and implantable renal assist devices (29–31), 
though none have yet undergone testing in clinical trials involving human subjects.
The WAK is designed to be worn and used by patients for up to 24 hours per day and, thus, represents 
a wearable form of extended-hours hemodialysis in which patients receive substantially longer treatments 
than available with conventional thrice-weekly hemodialysis. Extended-hours therapies have been shown 
to lead to improved control of electrolyte homeostasis, including reductions in serum phosphorus (32–34). 
Extended-hours therapies also allow for slower and more physiological rates of volume removal via ultra-
filtration, which may reduce the frequency of intradialytic hypotensive events and intradialytic myocardial 
stunning (35–37). Additionally, longer weekly treatment times have been shown to result in increased dialyt-
ic clearance of larger-molecular weight and protein-bound uremic retention solutes, which may at least part-
ly underlie the improved outcomes observed among patients undergoing extended-hours regimens (38, 39).
In our study, blood and dialysate flow, and consequently solute clearance, were intentionally lower

than utilized in conventional forms of hemodialy-
sis. Given the capability of the WAK to operative 
continuously, less aggressive hourly clearances 
were targeted to minimize solute flux during the 
treatment period. We found that, as anticipated, 
solute clearance varied in parallel with blood flow, 
and clearances of urea, creatinine, and phospho-
rus were similar at each study time point. Overall, 
we observed that urea clearances were higher than 
those for creatinine, though this was true only for a 
subset of study participants. Higher dialytic clear-
ance of urea compared with creatinine is expected 
due to the more rapid equilibration of urea between 
red blood cells and plasma, a principle that has 
been demonstrated in prior investigations (40–43). 
In contrast, though permeability of conventional 
dialyzer membranes is lower for inorganic phos-
phorus than for creatinine, prior studies have gener-
ally shown similar dialytic clearance of phosphorus 
compared with creatinine (40, 44, 45). This may 
due to uneven phosphate distribution among differ-
ent body compartments, with phosphate clearance 
during the dialytic procedure limited by the phos-
phorus transfer rate from the intracellular space to 
the plasma (46). The findings for comparative sol-
ute clearances observed in our study are similar to 
those from prior investigations, including similar 
time-varying clearances of phosphorus and creati-
nine for most patients. Although serum phosphorus 
remained normal in the absence of phosphate-binding medications or dietary restrictions, serum phospho-
rus rose for some patients over the course of the 24-hour study period. We also observed limited clearance 
of the middle-molecular weight solute β2-microglobulin at the blood and dialysate flows achieved in this 
study. These data are, however, consistent with previously reported data using the WAK (23), suggesting 
that these lower clearances might be related to the lower blood flow used in this trial. We observed that 
overall mean blood flow diminished somewhat toward the end of the 24-hour treatment period, large-
ly driven by a substantial drop in the blood flow for a single subject that was possibly related to either 
unintended variability in battery or shuttle pump function or to the effect of dialysate carbon dioxide gas 
accumulation on pump efficiency. Planned refinements of the WAK in the near future may increase solute 
clearances to approximate even greater kidney function by improving pump function through mechanical 
components redesign.
Patients enrolled in our study reported significantly greater treatment satisfaction during the WAK 
treatment period compared with ratings of care during periods of conventional in-center hemodialysis 
treatment. This finding is of particular importance, given a growing emphasis on enhancing patient-cen-
teredness of care in all aspects of the US healthcare system. Providing patient-centered care — care that

is in response to patients’ preferences, values, and needs — is 1 
of the 6 domains of quality of care advocated by the Institute of 
Medicine and is incentivized by the US Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid services in designing quality incentive programs for the 
ESRD population (47, 48). Prior studies of extended-hours and/or 
frequent hemodialysis therapies have suggested potential improve-
ments in health-related quality of life compared with conventional 
in-center hemodialysis therapy (8, 49–51). Additionally, previous 
mixed-methods assessments of patient and family preferences have 
shown that patients and caregivers highly value treatments that can be performed at home and that max-
imize independence and the ability to travel (52–54). Although the duration of exposure to the WAK 
was short and the study subjects represented a particularly motivated group of patients, our finding that 
treatment satisfaction scores for the WAK were higher in nearly every domain assessed is nonetheless an 
important preliminary result that deserves further investigation in future studies of the WAK.
There were no serious adverse events during the course of the study. We did not observe significant 
changes in serum haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, or blood hematocrit, suggesting that no clinically sig-
nificant hemolysis occurred over the course of the 24-hour WAK treatment. Similarly, we did not observe 
any clinically significant clotting of blood in the device in 6 of the 7 study subjects, even with lower hourly 
heparin infusions than commonly administered during conventional hemodialysis treatments. In the 1 sub-
ject in whom clotting occurred, this was likely attributable to a mechanical kinking of tubing that occurred 
during ambulation. Further studies are needed to clarify risk factors for clotting and optimal anticoagula-
tion for patients treated with the WAK.
Our study had several limitations. The substantial production of carbon dioxide bubbles in the dialy-
sate circuit was consistent with the observations of a previous study using the same device (21). Though 
this was anticipated, the venting mechanism used did not fully solve this problem, and manual removal of 
carbon dioxide gas from the dialysate circuit by study investigators using a lure-lock syringe was required 
for some patients. We observed intermittent variability in WAK blood and dialysate flow for the majority 
of patients. This variability had a number of possible sources. First, kinking of tubing was observed in both 
the blood and dialysate circuits at a variety of different device locations that included attachment of the 
blood tubing to the dialyzer, the attachments of the dialysate tubing into and out of the sorbent columns, 
and attachment of the dialysate tubing to the dialyzer. Second, excessive production of carbon dioxide 
bubbles resulted in increased resistance in the dialysate circuit, which may have impacted both blood and 
dialysate flow due to dual function of the shuttle pump to drive blood and dialysate flow simultaneously. 
Third, we observed variability in the performance of the main pulsatile pump with respect to flows generat-
ed, which may have been due to inconsistent power output or suboptimal positioning of the blood and/or 
dialysate tubing over the pump mechanism. Intermittent discordant variations in blood and dialysate flow 
rates in a number of subjects were also likely due to tubing kinks and dialysate-side carbon dioxide bubbles 
leading to differential resistances to flow on each side of the circuit. Further redesign of the WAK compo-
nents is planned prior to future studies. The redesign will include more effective degassing in the dialysis 
circuit through the use of larger venting mechanisms, use of less flexible tubing, and use of a manifold to 
reduce potential for line kinking. Additionally, the sorbent system may be redesigned to include materials 
that may adsorb urea, avoid the need for urease activity, and thus substantially reduce carbon dioxide gas 
production in the dialysate circuit. Redesign of WAK components will be aimed at ensuring ease of use 
and reliability of the operation of the device, given that the ultimate goal is for treatment with the WAK to 
be self-administered independently by patients and caregivers in the home environment.
While undergoing treatment, subjects were observed in a highly monitored inpatient setting, which

included hourly assessments of hemodynamic parameters and continuous cardiac telemetry. The long-term 
safety of continuous treatment with the WAK has not been established yet. Longer-term studies treating 
patients in the outpatient and home environment are necessary to address safety issues during ambulation 
and the home operation of the device by patients and to incorporate additional human factor elements.
In conclusion, the WAK is a dialysis technology with the potential to radically change the way dialysis 
therapy is delivered. As demonstrated in this FDA-approved exploratory clinical trial, 24-hour treatment of 
individuals with ESRD with a wearable, miniaturized, sorbent-based hemodialysis system is well-tolerated

and results in effective electrolyte homeostasis, solute clearance, and vol-
ume removal. Despite a variety of device-related technical complications 
encountered, this study serves as proof of concept of the WAK as an 
innovative alternative dialysis technology that has the potential to change 
the way ESRD is treated through enhancing patient choice and optimiz-
ing health-related quality of life for patients with ESRD.
Methods
Study subjects. Study subjects were recruited from outpatient dialysis facil-
ities from November 2014 through April 2015. Subjects were at least 21 
years of age, with a diagnosis of ESRD. They were undergoing mainte-
nance hemodialysis thrice weekly for at least 3 months prior to enroll-
ment. They weighed between 45 and 100 kilograms, with vascular access 
through a functioning double lumen tunneled dialysis catheter. Exclusion 
criteria included anticipated living related donor kidney transplant with-
in 2 months, a history of recent cardiovascular events or hemodynamic 
instability, or current active infection. Other eligibility criteria are provid-
ed in the Supplemental Methods.
WAK treatment. For the WAK treatment period, all subjects were 
admitted to an inpatient hospital unit and were monitored continuously 
by study physicians and nurses. Prior to initiation of the 24-hour treat-
ment with the WAK, each subject received a 4-hour conventional hemo-
dialysis session according to the subject’s routine clinical prescription. 
Following a 2-hour treatment-free transition period, subjects were connected to the WAK (Blood Purifica-
tion Technologies Inc.) (Figure 6) using an existing tunneled dialysis catheter. The WAK comprises a min-
iaturized wearable sorbent-based hemodialysis system utilizing a commercially available dialyzer (Gambro 
Polyflux 6H, Baxter) with an effective surface area of 0.6 m2 and blood compartment volume of 52 ml. 
A pulsatile pump powered by a rechargeable battery with dual-channel separated circuits propels blood 
and dialysate in a counter-current fashion through the dialyzer (20, 55). Dialysate is regenerated using 3 
sorbent-containing cartridges connected in series and containing, in order, urease (65 grams), zirconium 
phosphate (600 grams), hydrous zirconium oxide (51 grams), and activated charcoal (153 grams) (Figure 
7). The sorbent system uses urease (derived from jack beans and bound to insoluble aluminum oxide) to 
convert urea into ammonia and carbonate, which, in the presence of hydrogen ions, forms carbon dioxide. 
The ammonia is subsequently adsorbed by the zirconium phosphate layer along with other cations, such 
as calcium, magnesium, and potassium, in exchange for sodium and hydrogen, which are released. The 
carbon dioxide is vented into the atmosphere as a gas through a semipermeable degassing bubble removal 
system (membrane surface area 17.7 cm2, 3M). The hydrated zirconium oxide layer removes heavy metals, 
such as copper and lead, if present and also adsorbs anions, such as phosphate, in exchange for acetate. 
Other medium-sized solutes and organic compounds are adsorbed by charcoal in the final sorbent column. 
The approximate total volume of the blood circuit is 65 ml and of the dialysate circuit is 375 ml. Additional 
auxiliary micropumps (Sorenson Medical Products Inc.) control ultrafiltration, heparin infusion, and cal-
cium acetate, magnesium acetate, and sodium bicarbonate infusion into the dialysate circuit. An ultrasonic 
bubble detector on the arterial blood tubing and an optical blood leak detector on the dialysate tubing 
(Introtek) trigger an audible alarm and a pause of the main pump. Wetness sensors (Economical Liquid 
Sensor, Cole-Palmer) applied to the arterial and venous catheter connection sites detect external blood leak. 
The total weight of the device, including the dialysate, is 5 kg. “The WAK components used for testing in 
this trial were provided by Blood Purification Technologies Inc.
Vital signs, symptoms, and adverse events were recorded hourly, and electrocardiographic telemetry mon-
itoring was carried out continuously. Subjects were encouraged to eat and drink a normal diet, without restric-

tion of fluid, sodium, potassium, or phosphorus content. At the beginning of WAK therapy, each subject 
was given an initial heparin bolus of 2,000 units and started on a continuous heparin infusion at 500 units 
per hour. The heparin infusion rate was adjusted or additional heparin boluses were given according to the 
clinical judgment of the study investigator at the bedside, including assessment of partial thromboplastin 
time (PTT) and the appearance of any clots in the blood tubing or dialyzer. The goal PTT was determined 
by the bedside study investigator and ranged from 50 to 80 seconds. The initial ultrafiltration rate was set at 
50 ml per hour and was adjusted hourly at the discretion of the treating physician based on observed vital sign 
parameters as well as observed dietary and fluid intake. All regularly prescribed home medications with the 
exception of phosphorus-binding agents were continued. Subjects were encouraged to ambulate with study 
staff assistance while receiving treatment with the device and also to sleep during night time hours.
Analytical procedures. Blood samples obtained at predetermined time points were analyzed at the bedside 
(i-STAT, Abbot) for safety purposes and in the hospital’s clinical laboratory. Serum chemistries, bilirubin, 
lactate dehydrogenase, and haptoglobin were measured using a UniCel DxC 600 or 800 (Beckman Coulter), 
and complete blood count was measured using a Sysmex XE-5000 (Sysmex). Coagulation parameters were 
measured for the purpose of heparin titration using a Stago STA Compact analyzer (Diagnostica Stago Inc.). 
β2-Microglobulin concentrations were measured on a Vmax Spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices) using 
a competitive binding enzyme immunoassay (R&D Systems). To assess ammonia saturation of the sorbent 
cartridges, dialysate samples were tested hourly for ammonia accumulation (Sorb Technologies Inc.), with 
appearance of ammonia used as an indicator of sorbent column saturation. Detection of ammonia at a con-
centration of 5 mg% in any study subject prompted replacement of the 3-cartridge sorbent system.
Patient satisfaction with the WAK was assessed using the 13-item RTSQ (Health Psychology Research 
Limited) (56). The RTSQ has been developed and validated in patients with ESRD and has high internal 
reliability (Cronbach’s α = 0.93). Patients completed ratings of conventional hemodialysis using the RTSQ 
during a screening visit prior to WAK treatment and completed ratings of the WAK at the first study visit 
following completion of the WAK protocol.
Statistics. Baseline demographic and laboratory characteristics were summarized. Changes in biochem-
ical measurements from baseline were analyzed using analysis of variance for test of trend. Time-averaged 
concentrations (TACs) of BUN and β2-microglobulin were calculated for each patient for a 48-hour period 
encompassing a conventional hemodialysis session as TAC = [Td(C1 + C2) + Id(C2 + C3)]/2(Td + Id), where 
C1 is the venous concentration at the initiation of dialysis, C2 is the concentration at the end of dialysis, C3 is 
the concentration at the beginning of the next dialysis, Td is the session duration, and Id is the interdialytic 
interval (57). TACs for conventional hemodialysis were then compared with weighted average concentra-
tions for the 24-hour period encompassing WAK treatment using the paired 2-tailed Student’s t test.

Clearances of urea, creatinine, inorganic phosphorus, and β2-microglobulin during WAK treatment 
were calculated using two separate methods. Using blood side kinetics (58, 59), clearances were calculat-
ed according to the Fick principle as blood-based clearance (KB) = QB × (Cin – Cout) × (1 – Hct)/Cin, where 
QB is the blood flow rate (ml/min), Cin is the blood concentration of solute entering the dialyzer, Cout is 
the blood concentration of solute exiting the dialyzer, and Hct is the blood hematocrit. For 2 subjects, 
blood flows were not recorded at the 24-hour time point and were imputed as the 23-hour values. Using 
dialysate-side kinetics (58, 60), solute clearance was also calculated from the ratio of mass removal rate 
to blood concentration as dialysate-based clearance (KD) = CDialysate × QD/CBlood, where QD is the dialysate 
flow rate (ml/min); CDialysate is the dialysate solute concentration, calculated as the difference between the 
dialysate solute measurements before and after dialyzer; and CBlood is the blood concentration of solute 
entering the dialyzer. All data were included in the analyses, including data obtained during periods in 
which technical problems occurred with the WAK. Individual item treatment satisfaction scores and an 
overall summary score from the RTSQ for conventional hemodialysis and WAK treatment were com-
pared using the paired 2-tailed Student’s t test. For all analyses, a P value less than 0.05 was considered 
significant. All analyses were performed using Stata, version 11 (StataCorp LP).
Study approval. This study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was 
approved by the University of Washington Institutional Review Board. All subjects provided written 
informed consent before study enrollment.
