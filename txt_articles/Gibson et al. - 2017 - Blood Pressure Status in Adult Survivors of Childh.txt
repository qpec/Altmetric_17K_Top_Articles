Abstract
Background: Hypertension potentiates cardiovascular risk in
survivors of childhood cancer previously exposed to cardiotoxic
therapies, so it is important to determine the prevalence and risk
factors for hypertensive blood pressure in this high-risk group.
Methods: Participants included 3,016 adult 10-year survivors
of childhood cancer who had resting blood pressure measure-
ments performed at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (Mem-
phis, TN). We characterized the blood pressure status of partici-
pants, calculated standardized prevalence ratios based on U.S.
population rates, and examined demographic and treatment
factors associated with hypertensive blood pressure using logistic
regression.
Results: The age-specific cumulative prevalence of hyperten-
sion in survivors increased sharply with age, exceeding 70% by
age 50, and was substantially higher in all diagnosis groups than
expected on the basis of age-, sex-, race/ethnicity-, and BMI-
specific population rates. Specific cancer treatments were not
significantly associated with hypertension, with the exception of
nephrectomy (OR, 1.68; 95% confidence interval, 1.11–2.53).
Previously undiagnosed hypertensive blood pressure was identi-
fied in 8% of survivors, and uncontrolled hypertension in 22% of
those with a previous hypertension diagnosis. In a subset (n ¼
1,185) with longitudinal blood pressure measurements (mean
interval, 3.6 years), 5% and 21% of participants with previously
normal blood pressure developed hypertensive and prehyperten-
sive blood pressure, respectively.
Conclusions: Survivors of childhood cancer have a higher
prevalence of hypertension compared with the general popula-
tion, and many have uncontrolled hypertension that may exac-
erbate treatment-related cardiovascular risks.
Impact: Our results suggest enhanced clinical attention to
blood pressure status is warranted in all survivors, regardless
of diagnosis or cancer treatment. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev;

Introduction
Improvements in treatment and supportive care have dramat-
ically increased survival after pediatric malignancies, with more
than 83% of children now surviving at least 5 years and most
becoming long-term survivors (1). Unfortunately, the growing
population of childhood cancer survivors, currently exceeding
420,000 in the United States, experiences a wide range of adverse
late health effects (2). Prominent among these late effects is
cardiovascular disease, the leading noncancer cause of mortality
and morbidity in survivors (3–8). Cardiovascular disease–related
deaths are eight times more likely in childhood cancer survivors
compared with the general population (9), and serious cardiac
events are more than five times more likely in survivors compared
with siblings (6).
Much of the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in survivors
can be attributed to childhood exposure to chest-directed radia-
tion and/or high-dose anthracyclines. However, aging survivors
are increasingly susceptible to the same risk factors that impact the
general population, including hypertension, obesity, and dysli-
pidemia (10). Cancer therapies, including exposure to specific
chemotherapeutic agents (alkylating agents, antimetabolites, and
heavy metals) and abdominal radiation, are considered risk
factors for hypertension and indicators for active surveillance
(11). Hypertension is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease
in the general population (12), with recent evidence indicating it
is particularly harmful in survivors of childhood cancer previously
exposed to cardiotoxic treatments. A report from the Childhood
Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) found that although both cardi-
otoxic treatments and hypertension were independently associ-
ated with increased risk of coronary artery disease or heart failure,
the combination of these factors resulted in a greater than additive
increase in risk that yielded an 86-fold increased risk of heart
failure in survivors exposed to both anthracyclines and hyperten-
sion compared with neither factor (10). This suggests that devel-
opment of hypertension can exacerbate the damage caused by
cardiotoxic cancer treatments (13, 14).

 Given the importance of hypertension as an adverse modifying
factor for cardiac disease in childhood cancer survivors, there is a
clear need to better understand the blood pressure status of this
unique population. Limitations of previous studies such as reli-
ance on self-reported hypertension, small samples, inclusion of
only specific diagnosis groups, and lack of age-specific rates have
precluded a comprehensive understanding of blood pressure
abnormalities in adult survivors of childhood cancer (15–27).
The goal of this analysis was to examine clinically assessed blood
pressures in a large cohort of well-characterized childhood cancer
survivors with longitudinal follow-up.
Materials and Methods
Participants
Survivors of childhood cancer treated at St. Jude Children's
Research Hospital (SJCRH, Memphis, TN) who were at least 18
years of age and at least 10 years from diagnosis were eligible to
enroll in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study (SJLIFE). The goal of
SJLIFE is to provide ongoing medical assessments of survivors to
advance knowledge of long-term health outcomes; details regard-
ing recruitment and study design have been presented previously
(28, 29). In brief, the SJLIFE study is a retrospective cohort with
prospective follow-up in which participants returned to SJCRH to
undergo comprehensive risk-based medical evaluations based on
the Children's Oncology Group's Long Term Guidelines for
Survivors of Childhood, Adolescent, and Young Adult Cancers
(30). Data collection included abstraction of medical records,
completion of health questionnaires, neuromuscular functional
assessment, and collection of biological samples. Additional
retrospective clinical and diagnostic records were obtained from
community providers and the After Completion of Therapy (ACT)
Clinic at SJCRH and validated for presence of a prior hypertension
diagnosis and treatment (28). The protocol was approved by the
SJCRH Institutional Review Board, and all participants provided
informed consent. Of 5,067 eligible survivors, 3,016 enrolled in
SJLIFE and completed a baseline on-campus evaluation as of June
30, 2015, that included a standardized measurement of resting
blood pressure in the St. Jude Human Performance Laboratory.
Participants are brought back to SJCRH for follow-up assessments
at least once every 5 years according to a research-driven schedule;
at the time of this analysis, 1,185 participants had multiple visits
resulting in longitudinal blood pressure measurements (Fig. 1).
Outcome measures
Blood pressures were obtained by trained clinical staff follow-
ing a 5-minute rest in a seated position. Three consecutive mea-
surements, separated by a 1-minute rest, were obtained using a
calibrated sphygmomanometer. At least two consecutive valid
measurements were required for inclusion in this analysis, and
blood pressure status was determined on the basis of the average
of these measurements. Use of antihypertensive medications was
determined by survivor report and review of medical records.
Blood pressure status was defined on the basis of the highest
category of systolic or diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) as
normal (SBP <120 and DBP <80 mm Hg), prehypertension (SBP
120–139 or DBP 80–89) or hypertension (SBP �140 or DBP �90
mm Hg; ref. 31). Participants were considered to have hyperten-
sion if they had measured blood pressure in the hypertensive
range or had been previously diagnosed and were taking antihy-
pertensive medications. Date of onset was the start date for
medications according to medical records or the date of hyper-
tensive blood pressure measurement. Undiagnosed hypertensive
blood pressure was defined as a measured blood pressure in the
hypertensive range in a participant with no previously identified
hypertension. Similarly, uncontrolled hypertension was defined
as a measurement in the hypertensive range among participants
with previously identified hypertension.
Treatment exposures and covariates
Details regarding childhood cancer diagnosis and treatment
were obtained from medical records, including site and dose of
radiotherapy received, as well as specific chemotherapeutic agents
and cumulative doses administered. Alkylating agents were col-
lectively characterized according to the cyclophosphamide equiv-
alent dose (CED; ref. 32).Participant characteristics were obtained
from structured questionnaires in conjunction with medical/
social history obtained during SJLIFE clinic visits. These included
annual household income (�$20,000, $20,000–$59,999, or
�$60,000) and smoking status (never, former, or current). Height
and weight were measured and used to categorize participants
into body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) categories per the World
Health Organization (underweight <18.5, normal 18.5–24.9,
overweight 25.0–29.9, or obese �30.0 kg/m2; ref. 33).
Statistical analysis
Demographic, diagnosis, and treatment characteristics were
compared using c2 tests for participants and nonparticipants in
SJLIFE, as well as for participants with a single baseline SJLIFE
assessment and those with at least one subsequent follow-up
assessment. We incorporated age at first identification of hyper-
tension to plot age-specific Kaplan–Meier cumulative prevalence
curves along with associated 95% confidence intervals (CI)
among SJLIFE participants, both overall and stratified by sex or
race. Time at risk for each individual ended at the earliest of
hypertension identification or most recent SJLIFE assessment. In
addition, participants were categorized according to blood pres-
sure status at their first SJLIFE assessment, and characteristics
associated with prevalence of hypertension were identified using
multivariable logistic regression models to estimate ORs and 95%
CIs. The observed prevalence of hypertension in survivors was
compared with the prevalence that would be expected based on
age-, sex-, race/ethnicity-, and BMI category–specific rates from the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2011–2012
NHANES), which used similar methods to identify and classify
hypertension (34).
Participants without previously diagnosed hypertension were
considered to be at risk for undiagnosed hypertensive blood
pressure, and we calculated the proportion of those participants
who were identified as having hypertensive blood pressure at their
initial SJLIFE assessment. Conversely, participants with a prior
hypertension diagnosis were considered to be at risk for uncon-
trolled hypertension and served as the denominator for calculat-
ing the proportion of participants with uncontrolled hyperten-
sion at their initial SJLIFE assessment. Univariate associations
between demographic and treatment characteristics and preva-
lence of undiagnosed or uncontrolled hypertension were estimat-
ed by logistic regression, and only characteristics associated with P
< 0.10 were included in multivariable models. Finally, within the
subgroup with multiple SJLIFE assessments, we examined longi-
tudinal changes in blood pressure status and associations between
participant characteristics and changes in blood pressure category.

 Results
Of the 3,016 participants in this analysis, a slightly higher
proportion were male (52%), the majority were non-Hispanic
white (83%), and the mean age at initial SJLIFE assessment was 32
years (Table 1). Participants were more likely to be female
compared with nonparticipants, and modest differences in the
distribution of primary cancer diagnoses were reflected in higher
proportions of participants being exposed to radiation or che-
motherapy. Participants who returned for multiple SJLIFE assess-
ments were older and more likely to be non-Hispanic white, and
they had higher rates of exposure to radiation, alkylating agents,
and epipodophyllotoxins compared with those who had not yet
returned for a second assessment.
The age-specific cumulative prevalence of hypertension in
childhood cancer survivors increased sharply with age; 13% had
hypertension identified by age 30 years, with this proportion
reaching 37% by age 40 and exceeding 70% by age 50 (Fig. 2).
Although relatively few participants completed a SJLIFE assess-
ment after the age of 55 (n ¼ 20), our results suggest that as many
as 80% of survivors may have hypertension by this age. The age-
specific cumulative prevalence increased more steeply with age
compared with what would be expected based on rates in the
general population, with survivors generally having a prevalence
similar to that expected in people about 10 years older. The
prevalence of hypertension varied by childhood cancer diagnosis,
with survivors of Wilms tumor generally having the highest age-

prehypertension, and hypertension, respectively (Table 2). The
prevalence of hypertension was 2.6-fold (95% CI, 1.6–4.7) higher
among childhood cancer survivors than expected, based on age-,
sex-, race, and BMI-specific rates in the general population. Factors
significantly associated with higher odds of having prevalent
hypertension included male sex (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.14–
1.67), non-Hispanic black race (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.28–2.16),
older age at assessment (OR per one year of age, 1.10; 95% CI,
1.08–1.11), and being overweight (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.21–2.07)
or obese (OR, 3.02; 95% CI, 2.34–3.88). Exposures to radiother-
apy or chemotherapy were not significantly associated with
hypertension, with the exception of a CED >0 to �8,000
mg/m2 (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.10–1.93). Notably, higher doses
of alkylating agents were not significantly associated with hyper-
tension (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.89–1.49). Survivors who underwent
nephrectomy as part of their childhood cancer treatment were
more likely to have developed hypertension (OR, 1.68; 95% CI,
1.11–2.53), but no significant association was found for exposure
to abdominal or pelvic radiation (OR for �20 Gy compared with
none, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.85–1.79).
Among 2,459 participants who attended their first SJLIFE
assessment with no prior hypertension diagnosis, 207 (8.4%)
were identified as having unrecognized hypertensive blood pres-
sure (Table 3). Similar to prevalent hypertension overall, undi-
agnosed hypertensive blood pressure was more likely in males
(OR, 2.92; 95% CI, 2.09–4.08), other race/ethnicity compared
with non-Hispanic white (OR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.34–2.78), older
age at assessment (OR per one year of age, 1.08; 1.06–1.10), and
overweight/obese compared with normal BMI (OR for over-
weight, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.16–2.81; OR for obese, 3.46; 95% CI,
2.31–5.18). A total of 675 participants were identified with
hypertension based on our study criteria either before or during
the first SJLIFE visit, but only 52% reported via questionnaire that
they were aware of their hypertension.
Among the 557 participants who were diagnosed with hyper-
tension prior to their first SJLIFE assessment, 124 (22.3%) were
identified as having uncontrolled hypertensive blood pressure
(Table 3). Significant risk factors included male sex (OR, 2.01;
95% CI, 1.26–3.21), race other than non-Hispanic white (OR,
3.80; 95% CI, 2.18–6.60), and older age (OR per year of age,
1.05; 95% CI, 1.02–1.08).
Among participants with normal or prehypertensive blood
pressure status at the initial assessment, 4.5% or 21.2%, respec-
tively, were identified as having hypertensive blood pressure at a
subsequent assessment (mean time interval, 3.6 years; Table 4).
Factors associated with subsequent development of hypertensive
blood pressure included male sex (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.02–2.38),
older age at initial assessment (OR per year of age, 1.06; 95% CI,
1.03–1.09), and obesity (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.77–4.97; Supple-
mentary Table S1). Only 19.0% of participants with hypertension
at the first assessment were found to have normal blood pressure
at their subsequent visit, and most of those (65%) were on
antihypertensive medications; 35.0% of those with hypertension
at the first visit continued to have uncontrolled hypertensive
blood pressure at the subsequent visit.
Discussion
Hypertension is a leading contributor to cardiovascular mor-
bidity and mortality in the general population (35, 36) and is even
more deleterious among survivors of childhood cancer due to
potentiation of cardiovascular damage caused by cancer treat-
ments, including chest-directed radiotherapy and anthracycline
chemotherapy. More than one in five survivors in SJLIFE were
found to have this modifiable cardiovascular risk factor and 33%
were identified with prehypertensive blood pressure, a risk factor
for future hypertension (37). This study is the largest to date to
examine measured blood pressure among survivors from differ-
ent diagnosis groups, and the first to report prevalence by age and
compare it with general population rates. Our results demonstrate
that survivors have a higher prevalence of hypertension compared
with individuals in the general population thatis evident through-
out the life course. Moreover, one in 12 survivors had undiag-
nosed hypertensive blood pressure, and more than 20% of those
previously diagnosed with hypertension had persistent uncon-
trolled high blood pressure.
We used age-, sex-, race/ethnicity-, and BMI category–specific
NHANES rates to calculate the expected prevalence of hyper-
tensive blood pressure in the general population, so the
increased prevalence in survivors is not readily explained by
established hypertension risk factors. Childhood cancer treat-
ments likely play a role, as supported by our findings that age-
specific cumulative prevalence varied across diagnoses. How-
ever, it is notable that in a clinically assessed cohort of over
3,000 survivors with detailed treatment data, including radia-
tion dosimetry and chemotherapy dosages, we identified only
nephrectomy as a significant risk factor. Low-dose alkylating
agents were also significantly associated with hypertension in
the multivariable model, but the lack of any association at

 higher doses suggests this may not be a meaningful risk factor.
We did not find a significant association between abdominal or
pelvic radiation and hypertension, although the OR of 1.5 may
be suggestive of a modest association. Previous findings regard-
ing treatment factors and hypertension in childhood cancer
survivors have been inconsistent, but the large CCSS (n ¼
8,599) and Dutch AMC/LATER (n ¼ 1,442) studies reported
significant associations between abdominal radiation and
hypertension (OR, 1.9 and 2.5, respectively; refs. 21, 38).
Survivors of Wilms tumor had the highest prevalence of hyper-
tension in SJLIFE, supporting a role for renal etiology in a
subgroup of survivors. However, our findings suggest that
exposure to specific nephrotoxic treatments does not fully
explain survivors' increased risk of hypertension.

 Further research is needed to fully elucidate the multifactorial
mechanisms underlying the increased risk of hypertension in
childhood cancer survivors. In addition to direct tissue damage
by radiation and specific chemotherapeutic agents, more general
mechanisms related to cancer and its treatment may also con-
tribute, such as chronic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction,
altered immune function, and factors related to the accelerated
aging phenotype that has been observed in some survivors (39–
43). Therefore, our results support enhanced clinical attention to
blood pressure in all survivors of childhood cancer.
Despite most SJLIFE participants having received ongoing
survivorship care through the St. Jude After Completion of
Therapy Clinic, 12.8% of those attending their first SJLIFE
assessment were identified with undiagnosed hypertensive
blood pressure. This underscores the importance of frequent
blood pressure monitoring in this population, as rates of
undiagnosed high blood pressure are likely higher in survivors
not receiving routine follow-up. Data from NHANES during the
same time period showed that 82% of adults with hypertensive
blood pressure at examination reported being aware of their
hypertension, which compares with 52% in SJLIFE (based on
an identical questionnaire item). Although the prevalence of
uncontrolled hypertensive blood pressure was lower in SJLIFE
(22%) compared with NHANES (48% in 2011–2012), it
remains unacceptably high for a population known to be at
increased risk of cardiovascular complications. Even after the
initial SJLIFE visit, at which hypertensive participants were
informed of their increased risks and the need for medical
management, 35% of those who returned for a subsequent
assessment had uncontrolled high blood pressure. These data
underscore the importance of improving awareness of the
consequences of hypertension among childhood cancer survi-
vors and their community providers.
Strengths of this analysis included the large sample size,
direct clinical assessments, and the ability to examine a range
of ages, diagnoses, treatments, and lifestyle factors. We used
blood pressures measured during a single 3- to 4-day visit for
determination of an individual's blood pressure status at that
time, rather than separate measures over the course of multiple
office visits (31), potentially resulting in misclassification of
blood pressure status. Notably, NHANES estimates of U.S.
hypertension rates are based on the same methodology. Blood
pressure was measured in a relaxed nonoffice setting, poten-
tially reducing the impact of a "white coat effect," but measured
blood pressures may not be representative of usual blood
pressure in some participants (44, 45). Because our results
are based on a selected population with frequent clinical
follow-up, our estimates of undiagnosed and uncontrolled

 hypertension may be underestimates with respect to the larger
population of childhood cancer survivors. Finally, our results
could differ slightly using a different classification system to
categorize blood pressure status, and existing guidelines do not
address childhood cancer survivors (46).
Optimal blood pressure targets for childhood cancer survi-
vors exposed to cardiotoxic therapies have not been estab-
lished. Recently, the SPRINT trial demonstrated that among
hypertensive adults �50 years of age with elevated cardiovas-
cular risk, intensive treatment targeting a SBP <120 mm Hg
reduced cardiovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality com-
pared with standard treatment with an SBP target <140 mm Hg
(47). It is reasonable to suspect that more aggressive targets
could benefit childhood cancer survivors as well. Adoption of
lower blood pressure targets would further increase the pro-
portion of childhood cancer survivors potentially requiring
intervention. Given that hypertension can potentiate the
already increased risk of cardiovascular disease associated with
cancer treatment, our study demonstrates the need for effective
interventions targeting both prevention and control of hyper-
tension in survivors exposed to cardiotoxic therapies.
