Abstract
Characterizing respiratory rate variability (RRV) in humans during sleep is
challenging, since it requires the analysis of respiratory signals over a period
of several hours. These signals are easily distorted by movement and volitional
inputs. We applied the method of spectral analysis to the nasal pressure trans-
ducer signal in 38 adults with no obstructive sleep apnea, defined by an
apnea-hypopnea index <5, who underwent all-night polysomnography (PSG).
Our aim was to detect and quantitate RRV during the various sleep stages,
including wakefulness. The nasal pressure transducer signal was acquired at
100 Hz and consecutive frequency spectra were generated for the length of the
PSG with the Fast Fourier Transform. For each spectrum, we computed the
amplitude ratio of the first harmonic peak to the zero frequency peak (H1/
DC), and defined as RRV as (100 � H1/DC) %. RRV was greater during
wakefulness compared to any sleep stage, including rapid-eye-movement. Fur-
thermore, RRV correlated with the depth of sleep, being lowest during N3.
Patients spent most their sleep time supine, but we found no correlation
between RRV and body position. There was a correlation between respiratory
rate and sleep stage, being greater in wakefulness than in any sleep stage. We
conclude that RRV varies according to sleep stage. Moreover, spectral analysis
of nasal pressure signal appears to provide a valid measure of RRV during
sleep. It remains to be seen if the method can differentiate normal from
pathological sleep patterns.
Introduction
Heart rate variability (HRV) (Tobaldini et al. 2013) has
been used to describe sleep-related cardiovascular auto-
nomic alterations. Conversely, the physiological conse-
quences of respiratory rate variability (RRV) during sleep
are poorly understood (Tobin et al. 1983; Newton et al.
2014). A major impediment to a greater understanding of
RRV has been the lack of a “user-friendly” clinical tech-
nique capable of characterizing periodic alterations in res-
piratory pattern.
Heart rate variability is readily ascertained from analy-
sis of the ECG, a periodic signal of distinctive morphol-
ogy. On the other hand, defining RRV in sleep is
challenging since it requires the accurate and continuous
measurement of airway flow or pressure over many
hours. These signals are easily distorted by volitional
inputs, movement and other types of physical interfer-
ence. Consequently, the analysis of airway signals using
time-series techniques is often hampered by random and
difficult to detect signal aberrations. An alternative to
time-dependent methods is the application of Fourier
analysis to assess variations in periodicity from its fre-
quency spectrum. The approach of spectral analysis in
sleep has been applied to the EEG for sleep staging
(Campbell 2009) and to ECG signals in describing HRV
(Chouchou and Desseilles 2014).
Spectral analysis of airway flow has been used to char-
acterize patient-ventilator asynchrony (PVA) in critically
ill,
mechanically
ventilated
patients
(Gutierrez
et al.
2011). The method consists of sampling airway flow dur-
ing a defined time period, followed by the application of

 Fourier analysis to generate its frequency spectrum. Dur-
ing regular breathing, the frequency spectrum of airway
flow is characterized by sharply defined peaks of progres-
sively lower amplitude located at multiples of the mean
respiratory rate frequency (Fig. 1). The amplitude ratio of
the first harmonic peak (H1) to that of zero, or DC fre-
quency peak (H1/DC) has been used as a measure of
spectral organization. H1/DC varies inversely with PVA,
with values <40% being associated with asynchronous
breathing (Gutierrez et al. 2013).
The two main types of sleep are rapid-eye-movement
(REM) and nonrapid-eye-movement (NREM). The latter
includes three distinct stages: N1, N2, and N3. As sleep
progresses from stage N1 to N3, brain waves become
slower and more synchronized. Stage N3 is referred to as
“deep” or “slow-wave” sleep. In this study, we explored
the feasibility of applying spectral analysis to airway flow
data gathered during all-night polysomnography (PSG) in
spontaneously breathing individuals. We used the nasal
pressure transducer signal as a proxy for airway flow
(Grover and Pittman 2008), and generated sequential fre-
quency spectra at defined time intervals for the duration
of the PSG. Our aim was to detect and quantitate RRV
during the various sleep stages, including episodes of
wakefulness, in individuals with no obstructive sleep
apnea (OSA).
Materials and Methods
We analyzed all PSG records (Respironics Alice 6 LDXN
Sleep Diagnostic System, Philips Respironics, Murrysville,
PA) of patients tested at the Center for Sleep Disorders at
the Medical Faculty Associates at George Washington
University from 1 September 2014 through 31 August
2015. The study was approved by The George Washing-
ton University Institutional Review Board (No. 091546)
who waived informed consent provided all data were
de-identified.
Experimental set-up
An adult nasal pressure transducer cannula (Salter Labs,
Arvin, CA) was placed according to American Academy
of Sleep Medicine (AASM) standards of practice. Another
qualitative measure of airflow was provided by a single
channel oral/nasal thermistor (ProTech #1078754; Philips
Respironics) with two probes taped directly under the
nares and another extending to the front of the mouth
Figure 1. Nasal pressure signals and corresponding frequency spectra measured in a subject during sleep stage N2 (graph A) and REM sleep
(graph B). The mean expiratory values (dashed lines) equal the spectra’s DC components. The first harmonic peak (H1) is located at the
fundamental frequency or mean respiratory rate of the subject during the time-window. With increased variation in breath-to-breath timing,
the power near the fundamental frequency spreads across neighboring frequencies, leading to a widening and reduction in peak height.

Respiratory Rate Variability During Sleep in Adults
G. Gutierrez et al.
 (Pennock 1992). Nasal pressure and thermistor tracings
were sampled for the entire duration of the PSG at
100 Hz. Arterial O2 saturation (SpO2) was measured by
pulse oximetry (MasimoSET Radical, Masimo, Irvine,
CA) and sampled at 1 Hz. The subject’s body position
during sleep was assessed by an integrated microelec-
tromechanical
system
based
accelerometer
(Philips
Respironics) with manual-override by the attending tech-
nologist. Data were digitally recorded on an hourly basis
as European Data Format (EDF) files and exported to
ASCII file format using the EDF Browser 1.56 program
(Free Software Foundation, Inc., Boston, MA; General
Public License).
We used the AASM definition of apnea as a ≥90%
decrease in airflow signal for ≥10 sec and hypopnea as a
≥30% decrease in airflow signal for ≥10 sec with a reduc-
tion in SpO2 ≥3% or an associated arousal (Berry et al.
2015) and included in the study all patients with an
apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) <5.
Spectrum generation and analysis
We applied the method of Gutierrez et al. (2011) to gen-
erate frequency spectra from the nasal pressure signal
using software developed in-house for the purposes of the
study (Visual Basic, Microsoft Corporation, Redmond,
WA). In brief, the nasal pressure signal was modified by
setting all positive values to zero, resulting in a periodic
signal containing only the expiratory portion of the
breathing cycle. A frequency spectrum was generated by
applying the Cooley–Tukey Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
algorithm (Duhamel and Vetterli 1992) to the modified
nasal pressure signal data encompassed by a predeter-
mined time-window of constant duration. The length of
the time-window was mandated by the FFT requirement
of 2n samples per frequency spectrum. We chose 214 or
16,384 samples, resulting in a time-window of 2.73 min
at sampling rate of 100 Hz. The resulting spectrum had a
definition of 0.37 cycles per minute. Successive spectra
were generated for each time-window from the time data
recording began (lights off) to PSG end (lights on). There
were approximately 160 spectra generated for each patient
during a typical all-night PSG.
We determined the amplitude and frequency of H1
with a peak detection algorithm and calculated H1/DC for
each spectrum. Spectra having H1/DC <15% were rejected
from analysis, as preliminary data analysis showed these
low H1/DC values to occur whenever the nasal pressure
transducer signal either malfunctioned or the transducer
fell off the patient’s nose. The EDF files corresponding to
all rejected spectra were visually inspected to confirm the
absence of the pressure signal. Subjects in whom technical
malfunction resulted in absent nasal pressure tracings for
>50% of PSG time were excluded from the study. The
spectrum’s H1 frequency, or fundamental frequency, was
taken as the patient’s mean respiratory rate (RR)tw during
the spectral time-window. We also computed mean SpO2
for each time-window. For the purposes of this study, we
defined respiratory rate variability as RRV = 100 � H1/
DC%. Each spectrum was associated with its unique
RRV, (RR)tw and mean SpO2,.
Synchronization of the spectra to sleep
stage
A standardized scored event-marker report was developed
for each PSG containing multiple time-stamped events
(Berry et al. 2015) corresponding to the occurrence of a
predefined events (i.e., apnea, hypopnea, desaturation,
arousal, etc.). Each event was associated with one of four
sleep stages (REM, N1, N2 and N3) or wakefulness
(Wake) as identified by the AASM Manual for the Scor-
ing of Sleep and Associated Events (Anonymous 1999).
Given the random timing of these event marks, substan-
tial time-gaps often appeared from one mark to the next
during which the sleep stages were not reported. To iden-
tify a sleep stage corresponding to each time-window, we
placed additional event marks at 5 min intervals from
beginning to end of the PSG that were associated with a
unique sleep stage. In this manner, all spectra were
assured to span at least one unique sleep stage. The modi-
fied score event marker for each PSG was saved as an
Excel worksheet (Microsoft Corporation).
We synchronized the spectral time-windows to the
scored event marker by matching each subject’s EDF file
initial recording time to the event marker lights off time.
In this manner, each spectrum could be assigned a sleep
stage. In those cases where the spectral time-window
encompassed two or more sleep stages, the spectrum was
associated with the stage of longest duration. We tested
the internal validity of this process for each subject by
comparing the total time spent in various sleep stages, as
reported in an epoch-by-epoch analysis of the PSG (PSG
time),
to
the
product
of
the
spectral
time-window
(2.73 min) and the number of spectra associated with
each sleep stage (Spectral time).
For each patient’s PSG, we calculated the mean values
for RRV, (RR)tw, SpO2 and the time spent in each sleep
stage and wakefulness.
Statistics
Data distributions were examined and non-normal distri-
butions were either natural-log transformed if positively
skewed, or recoded into quartiles if outliers were present.

 intraquartile range) are reported by sleep stage. As all data
are examined across sleep stages within subjects, and
because not all subjects entered every sleep stage, leading
to missing data, data analysis required an approach that
both accounts for auto-correlation within subjects, and
that does not drop subjects from analysis if they are miss-
ing data at a single sleep stage. Both analysis of variance
(ANOVA) and repeated-measures ANOVA are thus ruled
out. Therefore, mixed model regression was used to
examine
univariate
associations
between
physiological
variables and sleep stage. As we were interested in within-
subject changes in RRV parameters across sleep stages, a
fixed-effects mixed model was used, which compares val-
ues across stages within subjects. First, univariate models
were tested for each individual physiological variable (to-
tal sleep time per stage, breathing rate, H1/DC, SpO2)
using Wake as the reference group, and then using REM
as the reference group. Next, using H1/DC as the time-
varying dependent variable, models were tested adjusting
for total time and breathing rate at each sleep stage, to
examine the independent effects of sleep stage on RRV,
adjusting for time-varying covariates. SAS version 9.3
(Cary, NC) was used for all data analysis, with P < 0.05
considered significant.
Results
Of 492 diagnostic PSG records performed in 1 year, we
identified 42 that met the inclusion criterion of AHI <5.
We excluded from analysis four patients whose nasal
pressure tracings were measured for <50% of total PSG
time due to technical factors. The cohort’s median age
was 40.0 [32.3–55.5] years with BMI of 24.5 [22.1–31.7]
kg m�2. There was a preponderance of women (76.3%).

tions and use of medicines, alcohol and tobacco are typi-

institution (Table 1).
Figure 1 shows nasal pressure signals with their corre-
sponding frequency spectra measured in a subject during
sleep stage N2 (graph A) and REM sleep (graph B). The
nasal pressure mean expiratory values (dashed lines) equal
the spectra’s DC components. The first peak (H1) is
located at the fundamental frequency or mean respiratory
rate of the subject during the time-window.
Greater breath-to-breath timing variation causes the
power near the fundamental frequency to spread out
across neighboring frequencies, leading to a reduction in
peak height as the peaks broaden and the high-frequency
harmonics disappear. Conversely, mean expiratory flow
(and consequently DC amplitude) changes little during
the time-window. The result is an increase in RRV,
expressed in term of 100 � H1/DC%.
Using spectral analysis, alterations in nasal pressure fre-
quency spectra can be followed sequentially. This is illus-
trated in Figure 2 that shows a waterfall plot of spectra
determined at consecutive 2.73 min time-windows for
100 min of sleep time. Initially, the spectra display a reg-
ular peak pattern typical of steady breathing with the sub-
ject in stage N2. As the subject enters REM, there is a
significant increase in amplitude, reflecting greater nasal
airflow, with noticeable spectral disorganization. The
spectra revert to their initial pattern with return to N2. A
numerical assessment of spectral changes is shown in the
bottom graph, where RRV (computed as 100 � H1/DC
%) is plotted against time. RRV increases as the subject
moves from N2 to REM (shaded box). Mean RRV values
during these sleep stages is 41.2% for N2 and 60.0% for
REM. As the subject reverts to N2, the mean RRV
decreases to 48%.
For the cohort, the PSG duration was 434 � 71 min,
with a sleep efficiency of 80.5 � 13.1%. A total of 6084
spectra were generated for the group, or 160 � 26 spectra
per subject. We rejected 36 spectra due to an absence of
nasal pressure signal, or 0.6% for the group. Table 2
shows the percent of total sleep time for the various sleep
stages obtained from the PSG (PSG time) and that calcu-
lated by multiplying 2.73 min by the number of spectra
in a given sleep stage (Spectral time). The mean absolute
difference was <2% for all stages confirming the validity
of the method used to assign a given sleep stage to a
spectrum. The percent time distribution according to

Respiratory Rate Variability During Sleep in Adults
G. Gutierrez et al.
 (Aeschbach et al. 1996), with the majority of sleep time
occurring in N2.
Compared to Wake, RR was lower for all sleep stages
(P < 0.01 for N1 and N3; P < .0001 for REM and N2)
(Table 3). There were no differences in RR among the
sleep stages. Also when compared to Wake, there was a
statistically (P < 0.01), although not clinically significant
decline in SpO2 during all sleep stages (Table 3).
Figure 3 shows RRV for Wake and the various sleep
stages. RRV was greatest during Wake and REM and
decreased progressively with depth of sleep from N1 to
N3 (P < 0.0001). RRV was lower during REM, compared
to Wake (P < 0.05). Adjusting for time and respiratory
rate in each stage, RRV remained significantly lower in all
sleep stages, compared with Wake (P < 0.0001 for N1,
N2, and N3, P = 0.0033 for REM), and was significantly
lower during N2 (P = 0.0024) and N3 (P < 0.0001), com-
pared to REM. The subjects spent the majority of their
time in the supine position (Table 4), but there were no
differences in RRV according to body position.
Discussion
The physiological response of the respiratory system dur-
ing wakefulness differs from that of sleep (Dempsey et al.
1996). As volitional control and wakeful stimuli wane,
ventilation becomes a function of the metabolic rate dur-
ing sleep (Sowho et al. 2014). Chemoreceptor sensitivity
is diminished, this being more pronounced during REM
sleep, resulting in an attenuated responsiveness to chemi-
cal and mechanical stimuli (Douglas et al. 1982b; Hede-
mark and Kronenberg 1982; Dempsey and Smith 2014).
Although there is marked variability among normal indi-
viduals in upper airway collapsibility (Wiegand et al.
1989), reduced tonic drive of pharyngeal dilator muscles
during sleep increases upper airway resistance during
inspiration (Henke et al. 1990). These alterations are
bound to influence the pattern of respiration during
sleep.
Here, we present data from 38 patients with no OSA in
whom we measured RRV during sleep. We quantitated
RRV during the sleep stages by applying a previously vali-
dated method of spectral analysis to the expiratory por-
tion of the nasal pressure signal. We found differences in
RRV between wakefulness and REM sleep, and also noted
that RRV decreased in all NREM stages in concert with
the depth of sleep, being lowest in N3. These findings are
consistent with the long held observation that respiration
becomes more regular during sleep (Reed and Kleitman
1926).
We analyzed only the expiratory portion of the nasal
pressure signal. This choice was dictated by the absence
of a DC component in the spectrum of the entire signal,

pressure spectra obtained from a single patient during N2 and REM

Respiratory Rate Variability During Sleep in Adults
 since airway flow during the respiratory cycle approxi-
mates zero. Furthermore, H1 depends not only on RRV,
but also on signal strength, thus preventing the accurate
comparison among spectra based solely on H1 morphol-
ogy. Conversely, the expiratory component of the nasal
pressure signal has a nonzero mean value and its associ-
ated spectrum has a measurable DC component that also
changes with signal strength. The amplitude of the DC
component thus provides a metric with which to assess
changes in H1, that is, independent of signal strength.
Although other pattern recognition schemes could be
used to assess spectral changes, the amplitude ratio H1/
DC is known to be a reliable parameter of spectral orga-
nization (Gutierrez et al. 2011), one that allows for the
comparison of RRV among sleep stages and across patient
groups.
There is a paucity of studies in the literature reporting
RRV in sleep. Shore et al. (1985) compared the coefficient
of variation (CV) of the respiratory rate of healthy young
and elderly individuals from respiratory inductive plethys-
mographic (RIP) signals. They obtained 15 min spans of
data during wakefulness and sleep and determined breath-
ing periodicity by visual examination of the data. CV was
similar for wakefulness and a combined stage N1–2, but
declined during N3. These investigators (Pack et al. 1988)
subsequently sampled RIP signals at a relatively low rate
of 2.5 Hz and applied digital comb filtering to determine
ventilatory periodicities in eight individuals without OSA
aged over 66 years. Unlike their prior study, they found
greater periodicities in N1–2 compared to wakefulness. In
agreement with our results, they found periodicities in
N3 to be mostly absent. Both studies, however, lacked
data measured during REM. Immanuel et al. (2014) also
used RIP to study RRV in children with sleep disordered
breathing and found both groups to have greater RRV
during REM when compared to stages N2 and N4.
Rostig et al. (2005) and Kantelhardt et al. (2003) used
the technique of detrended fluctuation analysis to mea-
sure breath-to-breath variability in healthy individuals
from airway flow measured with a pneumotachograph.
Also in agreement with our findings, they noted greater
RRV in REM when compared to NREM sleep. More
recently, Nguyen et al. (2016) proposed the use of a
semi-automated technique to characterize RRV from the
statistical
properties
of
the
time
between
successive
breaths, or interbreath interval (IBI). They identified the
zero-crossing and peak inspiratory and expiratory points

 of airway flow with an amplitude threshold algorithm
and computed successive IBIs. RRV was characterized by
the SD and CV of the IBIs. Their results are similar to
ours, in that RRV was noted to be greater during REM
and wakefulness compared to NREM.
We noted a decrease in respiratory rate during all sleep
stages compared to wakefulness, but no differences in res-
piratory rate among the sleep stages. These results con-
trast with those of Douglas et al. (1982a), who found
increases in RR during sleep in 19 healthy men in whom
airway flow was measured via a fiberglass mask connected
to a hot wire anemometer. Other studies in young,
healthy men, however, have found either no change
(Stradling et al. 1985) or decrease (Tabachnik et al. 1981;
Krieger et al. 1983; Lopes et al. 1983) in RR with sleep
compared to wakefulness. Stradling et al. (1985) argued
that the increase in RR during sleep, as reported by Dou-
glas et al., may have been related to an imposed addi-
tional
dead
space
and
to
the
relative
hypoxemia
experienced by the subjects being studied at an elevation
of 1600 m.
There are no studies on the effect of body position on
RRV. On the basis of prior studies on OSA patients
(Joosten et al. 2014), we expected to find greater RRV in
the supine and lateral positions (Oksenberg et al. 2000).
Our cohort of individuals with no OSA spent the major-
ity of their sleep time on the supine position, but no rela-
tionship between body position and RRV was evident. It
maybe that non-OSA patients experience little or no air-
way diameter reduction during the supine position and
therefore no increase in RRV. Further studies are needed
to determine the relationship with of RRV to body posi-
tion in OSA patients.
Our study has several limitations. It is a retrospective,
single-center study having a relatively small sample size.
We strived to minimize retrospective bias by searching
for individuals with AHI <5 in all diagnostic PSGs per-
formed during a predefined time period of 1 year. The
number patients meeting entry criteria was determined by
the few PSG studies that were ordered in individuals with
sleep-related complaints, but who turned out to have no
sleep apnea. Given these constraint, however, our cohort
is significantly larger than other studies on RRV during
sleep (Kantelhardt et al. 2003; Rostig et al. 2005; Nguyen
et al. 2016).
We do not consider the subjects studied here to repre-
sent a “normal” cohort since these individuals were ini-
tially referred for a PSG in response to a sleep-related
complaint. None of the subjects, however, was considered
to have OSA, as defined by an AHI <5 on PSG. This in
contrast to studies that report RRV in putatively normal
individuals, but include in the cohort patients with sleep
disordered breathing. Krieger et al. (1983) and Shore
et al. (1985) found 17.5% and 38%, respectively, of young
healthy subjects without sleep-related complaints to have
AHI >5. In the study of Nguyen et al. (2016), the mean
AHI of the control group was 9.9 � 9.7. On the other
hand, our heterogeneous cohort included individuals of
both genders and diverse ethnic backgrounds, encompass-
ing a wide range of age and body weight and a significant
portion
was
afflicted
with
comorbidities
typical
of
patients seen commonly in sleep disorders clinics.
We used the nasal pressure transducer signal as a sur-
rogate for airway flow (Grover and Pittman 2008). This is
a clinically accepted technique (Thurnheer et al. 2001)
and the relationship between nasal pressure and flow has
been previously described (Wheatley et al. 1991). Nasal
pressure transducers, however, record only nasal airflow
and it is possible for the signal to lose power with oral
breathing. Since spectral analysis can be applied to any
periodic signal associated with respiratory motion, we
compared RRV calculated from the expiratory compo-
nents of both nasal pressure and thermistor signals
(BaHammam 2004). Figure 4 shows RRV calculated from
the thermistor signal. There were no differences in the
relative degree of RRV among sleep stages when calcu-
lated using nasal pressure or thermistor signal. We prefer,
however, to use the expiratory portion of the nasal pres-
sure signal, since it appears to be more reliable.
One strength of our study is the use of minimally inva-
sive measures on ventilation, therefore avoiding possible
alterations in respiratory patterns produced by masks or

with apnea-hypopnea index <5 shown according to sleep stage and
wakefulness. RRV was calculated from the expiratory components
of the thermistor signal and expressed as 100 � H1/DC%. The
results are similar to those noted when using the nasal pressure
signal, RRV was greatest during Wake and REM and decreased
progressively with depth of sleep from N1 to N3. *P < 0.0001;

 other devices designed to measure flow. Furthermore, the
lack of selective pre-analysis of the data by smoothing or
digital filtering adds to the robustness of the method. The
application of spectral analysis, instead of a time-depen-
dent technique of time-series analysis, bypassed the need
to apply digital filtering minimizing raw data manipula-
tion. Instead of evaluating selected, noise-free time peri-
ods, we analyzed data as they were recorded, producing a
spectrum every 2.73 min for the duration of the PSG.
The ability to analyze airway signals directly may poten-
tially allow for the determination of RRV concurrently
with the acquisition of PSG data on a real-time basis.
The physiological consequence of RRV in sleep, in par-
ticular during pathological states, is an open field for
investigation. For instance, recent studies have shown that
breathing patterns differ in mixed central and obstructive
apnea compared to obstructive dominant apnea (Yamau-
chi et al. 2013) with a possible association between CPAP
acceptance and breathing irregularity. Research in RRV
during sleep has been hampered previously by the lack of
a robust and reliable measuring technique. The applica-
tion of spectral-frequency analysis to the pressure nasal
airflow signal appears to be a novel and promising
method with which to assess RRV during sleep. It
remains to be tested if the method is capable of differenti-
ating normal from pathological sleep patterns.
