Abstract
Background
Disease-associated malnutrition has been identified as a prevalent condition, particularly
for the elderly, which has often been overlooked in the U.S. healthcare system. The state-
level burden of community-based disease-associated malnutrition is unknown and there
have been limited efforts by state policy makers to identify, quantify, and address malnutri-
tion. The objective of this study was to examine and quantify the state-level economic bur-
den of disease-associated malnutrition.
Methods
Direct medical costs of disease-associated malnutrition were calculated for 8 diseases:
Stroke, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Coronary Heart Failure, Breast Cancer,
Dementia, Musculoskeletal Disorders, Depression, and Colorectal Cancer. National dis-
ease and malnutrition prevalence rates were estimated for subgroups defined by age, race,
and sex using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the National
Health Interview Survey. State prevalence of disease-associated malnutrition was esti-
mated by combining national prevalence estimates with states’ demographic data from the
U.S. Census. Direct medical cost for each state was estimated as the increased expendi-
tures incurred as a result of malnutrition.
Principal Findings
Direct medical costs attributable to disease-associated malnutrition vary among states from
an annual cost of $36 per capita in Utah to $65 per capita in Washington, D.C. Nationally
the annual cost of disease-associated malnutrition is over $15.5 billion. The elderly bear a
disproportionate share of this cost on both the state and national level.

Additional action is needed to reduce the economic impact of disease-associated malnutri-

health care costs.
Introduction
Disease-associated malnutrition (DAM) is malnutrition that occurs from disease-related
causes. This is different from malnutrition caused by lack of availability of food. In patients
with DAM, nutrient intake is diminished and inflammatory responses increase [1], inducing
increased metabolic demand, decreased appetite, gastrointestinal problems, and difficulty
chewing and swallowing, all of which can decrease lean body mass and increase the risks of
complications during treatment of the primary disease [2]. Increased inflammatory responses
also diminish immune response, increasing infection rates, decreasing muscle strength, retard-
ing wound healing, and reducing physical function [3]. Collectively these factors increase risks
for functional disability, frailty, and falling [4].
Related to malnutrition, sarcopenia (age-associated decrease in muscle mass and function)
is commonly described as a concern for the institutionalized elderly. Emerging evidence sug-
gests it is also a concern among free-living elderly [5–7]. Sarcopenic obesity, characterized by
low lean body mass in obese individuals, is particularly under-recognized as the excess fat
deposits hide the wasted lean body mass in “plain sight.” Among ICU patients, prevalence of
sarcopenia has been documented at 56–71%, with 46% or more categorized as overweight/
obese by BMI [8,9]. Approximately 30% of liver failure patients with sarcopenia are over-
weight/obese [10].
Malnutrition is a largely under-recognized health problem. Greater than one-third of
patients are malnourished prior to being admitted to the hospital [11]. Further, one-third of
patients not malnourished at the time of admission, become malnourished during their stay at
the hospital [12]. While DAM impacts patient functionality and health outcomes, it is not just
a problem for patients and their families. Because of the economic burden it places on the
healthcare system, DAM is also an important concern for society, especially for healthcare pro-
viders and policy makers. DAM increases the overall costs of care, increasing complications,
extending hospital stays, and elevating rates of readmissions. The American Society for Paren-
teral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) recently proposed that “addressing disease-[associ-
ated] malnutrition in hospitalized patients should be a national goal in the United States. . .to
improve patient outcomes by reducing morbidity, mortality, and costs. . . [and] to alert health
care organizations on the need to provide optimal nutrition care.” Further, they noted “Nutri-
tion intervention has been shown to improve clinical outcomes in many studies, most often in
patients 65 years of age or older who are malnourished or at risk for developing malnutrition.”
[13].
Health economic studies are important for investigating the role that malnutrition care can
play in reducing costs. Health economics research has traditionally been focused on medical
treatments and therapies, however the number of economic studies of nutrition and malnutri-
tion is expanding [14]. Several studies have estimated the direct medical cost of DAM on the
international or national level. Most notably, a study by Inotai et al. estimated in 2009 the
direct medical cost burden of DAM in Europe was over €31 billion [15]. A similar study by Sni-
der et al. estimated DAM in the United States had an annual burden of $9.5 billion in direct
medical cost (2010 dollars) [16].

not alter our adherence to PLOS ONE policies on
sharing data and materials.
 These national and international estimates of spending are valuable in understanding the
magnitude of DAM on a national scale, however, many policy actions to address malnutrition
take place at the local and/or state levels. To make informed decisions, state policy makers
must understand the cost of DAM in their jurisdiction. The objective of our study is to examine
and quantify state-level economic burden (measured in direct medical costs) of disease-associ-
ated malnutrition in the United States, to help policy makers more completely understand the
magnitude of the problem and provide support for policy changes needed to better identify,
prevent, and treat malnutrition.
Methods
We estimate state-level direct medical costs of DAM for 8 diseases that were previously
included in the economic studies by Inotai et al. and Snider et al.: breast cancer, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), colorectal cancer (CRC), coronary heart disease
(CHD), dementia, depression, musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) and stroke. Direct medical
costs were estimated using similar methodology as Inotai et al. [15] and Snider et al. [16], with
necessary adjustments to enable results at the state level. High prevalence diseases were deliber-
ately avoided because, as noted by Snider et al., “malnourished individuals may have more
than 1 disease” therefore “counting the burden of DAM across several high prevalence diseases
(. . .) would likely lead to counting some of the same malnourished individuals more than
once.”[16].
Consistent with Snider et al. [16] and Somanchi et al. [17], malnutrition was defined as hav-
ing less than 90% of ideal body weight [18], and/or serum albumin levels less than 3.5 g/dL
[19]. Ideal body weight was identified using the traditional Hamwi [20] equation: 106 lbs + 6
lbs/inch over 5 feet for men; 100 lbs + 5 lbs/inch over 5 feet for women. Low albumin has been
shown to predict mortality, but it can be affected by factors other than nutritional status,
including inflammation [21]. However, concerns for the profound fluctuations in albumin that
accompany acute illness are somewhat diminished because the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) used for our analysis excludes institutionalized participants.
Further, inclusion of albumin in our economic model enables comparability between our find-
ings and previous studies in this area. All other disease definitions used in our study are based
on those used by Snider et al. [16] and are listed in S1 Appendix.
State-level direct medical cost of DAM was calculated in five steps. First, the prevalence of
malnutrition (as previously defined to be less than 90% of ideal body weight and/or serum
albumin levels less than 3.5 g/dL) within each of the 8 diseases was calculated using data from
the NHANES 2009–2014 [22]. Different prevalence rates were estimated for 30 groups defined
by age (< = 18, 19–45, 46–55, 56–64, > = 65), sex (male, female) and race (white, black, other).
Second, disease prevalence for each age-sex-race group was calculated. We used the
National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) when possible because of its larger sample size [23].
When disease definitions from NHIS did not closely match the definition in NHANES, or
could not be found, NHANES data was used to estimate disease prevalence (all child disease
prevalence and adult dementia and depression rates were estimated with NHANES). NHIS def-
initions for all disease rates can be found in S1 Appendix and are based on those used by Snider
et al. [16].
Third, state population estimates for each age-sex-race group were obtained from the U.S.
Census [24].
Fourth, estimates of the average direct medical cost for each condition, and the proportional
increase attributable to malnutrition were identified from the literature. These estimates are
provided in S1 Appendix.

 Finally, the total state-level direct medical cost of DAM for each condition was estimated
using the following equation:

PMNijis the prevalence of malnutrition in disease i for group j
DMN is the ratio of costs between malnurioushed individuals and non � malnourished individuals
rij is the prevalence of disease i in group j
POPj is the number of individuals in group j
Sensitivity Analysis
A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted using Monte Carlo simulation. Both the NHIS
and NHANES surveys were probabilistically recreated using the -svybsamp2- program in Stata
13.1 [25] to resample the data and preserve the same survey structure of the original surveys [26].
Cost parameters were randomly drawn from a gamma distribution when adequate information
was reported to allow specification. When such information was not available, costs were drawn
from a uniform distribution with the upper and lower bounds 20% away from the mean. The
simulation was repeated 1000 times and results are reported as 90% confidence intervals. Details
on parameters used in the sensitivity analysis can be found in S1 Appendix.
Results
Estimates of the state level burden of direct medical spending on DAM are presented in
Table 1. California has the largest burden of DAM with direct medical expenditures of over
$1.7 billion annually. Texas, Florida and New York also face a significant burden of DAM with
expenditures of over $1 billion annually.
It is not surprising that larger states, such as those listed above, would face the highest bur-
den of DAM. A more relevant statistic may be direct medical expenditures per capita attribut-
able to DAM (Fig 1). Our analysis shows significant variation in state level spending per capita.
Utah has the lowest burden at $36 per capita and Washington D.C. the highest with $65 per
capita.
While the focus of this paper has been to estimate the state level burden of DAM, it is useful
to look at national results as well, both to compare our results to previous studies and to better
understand which diseases are the most costly contributors of DAM (Table 2).
We estimate that the burden of DAM for the 8 diseases studied was over $15.5 billion or
$48 per capita annually. This is greater than the most recent comparable estimate from Snider
et al. which estimated the direct medical cost of DAM for these same diseases to be $10.4 billion
(adjusted for inflation) [16]. There are two primary reasons for this gap. First, Snider et al.’s
estimate was based on 2 years of NHANES data (2009–2010) while our findings reflect 6 years
(2009–2014), which results in different within disease estimates of malnutrition. Second, we
attempted to use the most current literature for our estimates of disease costs, to reflect changes
in the health care landscape. Therefore our costs were different from Snider et al.’s for some
specific diseases. Our per capita cost is higher than Snider et al.’s ($48 vs. $32), much closer to
the European per capita DAM medical cost estimate of $45.

 Comparison of the contributions of different diseases to the cost of DAM reveals that
dementia is by far the greatest contributor, costing the United States over $8.7 billion annually
(Fig 2). This is primarily because the average annual medical spending on dementia patients is
high ($36,397) [27], the prevalence of dementia is high (7% using NHANES data) and malnu-
trition among patients with dementia is high (7% using NHANES data). The next closest driver
of cost is depression, which costs $2.46 billion annually.
Because the age 65 and over population is of particular interest to policy makers and health-
care providers, we also report results for this age group. Although only 14% of the population
are age 65 and older, they account for 28% ($4.3 billion) of the total U.S. burden of DAM, and
the per capita cost for the elderly is almost double that of the general population ($93 per capita
for aged 65+ vs. $48 per capita for the general population). This cost reflects the higher disease
prevalence among older adults. For example, the prevalence of dementia in those age 65 and
over is higher than the general population (12.5% vs. 6%, p<0.01), and older adult dementia
patients are no less likely to be malnourished (6.0% older adult dementia patients vs. 7.8% gen-
eral population dementia patients, p = 0.60)
Discussion
The field of health economics and nutrition is an emerging area of research. To our knowledge
this is the first study to explore the economic burden of DAM at the state level. Increasing
healthcare costs are a major concern, particularly in our aging society. It is likely the progres-
sion of DAM can be mitigated through optimizing nutritional care. The size of the economic
burden of DAM nationally, at the state level and on a per capita basis indicates a need for sys-
tematic research in this area.
Most changes in the healthcare system occur at the local and state levels. The data from this
study provides evidence for state policy makers and hospital administrators to develop action
plans and policy changes (such as instituting a malnutrition quality measure in hospitals)
which promote change in clinical practices and health outcomes that ultimately will decrease

1 All confidence intervals with the exception of the second set in national totals are based on 1000 Monte Carlo simulations holding the global parameter
(increased disease cost of malnutrition) constant. This allows states to be compared to each other and to the national total. The second set of confidence
intervals for the national totals are based on 1000 Monte Carlo simulations where the global parameter varies according to the distribution outlined in S1

 healthcare costs. Malnutrition is costly to our healthcare system and proper nutrition can
lessen this cost. One area where reduction of DAM holds promise for dramatic cost reductions
is hospital readmissions. Federal healthcare reform and implementation of the Readmission
Reduction Program penalize hospitals for high readmission rates. Nutritional interventions
have been shown to reduce readmission rates [28,29]. Consumption of oral nutrition supple-
ments in hospitalized patients significantly decreased the probability for 30 day readmission,
length of stay, and health care cost [28]. Meehan et al. found treating patients at risk for malnu-
trition with oral nutrition supplementation reduced incidences of pressure ulcers, length of
stay, 30 day readmissions and costs of care [30]. Identification of malnutrition or risk for mal-
nutrition in the hospital and prior to discharge provides an opportunity to tailor home-based
nutritional interventions after discharge. A nutrition assessment just prior to discharge with a
nutrition care plan for patients with or at risk for developing malnutrition seems warranted.
Malnutrition is also a concern for transitions of care. The lack of standardized malnutrition
screening means that there is not a consistent link to connect malnutrition care between hospi-
tals, nursing homes, home, and community settings. Watson et al. [31] recommended
approaching the issue in a “multisystem, not just multidisciplinary way, as policy makers,
health systems, and healthcare professionals all play roles.” An ICD-10 code for sarcopenia will

 be available in October 2016. It is hoped this will provide a basis for the development of a
broader universally accepted definition for DAM.
Numerous studies have reported patients who remained well-nourished during hospitaliza-
tion had lower health care costs compared to those who became malnourished [12,32–34].
Additionally, several recent studies have explored the cost effectiveness of providing nutrition
supplementation to at-risk [35–39]. The NOURISH Study Group is the largest randomized
controlled clinical trial (N = 652) investigation to date of the effectiveness of oral nutrition sup-
plements, oral ingestion of supplementary foods for medical reasons. They found older, mal-
nourished patients randomized to high-protein oral nutritional supplement for 90 days had
improved nutritional status and decreased mortality compared to those randomized to a pla-
cebo [40].
There is evidence that proper nutrition can help improve clinical outcomes for malnour-
ished patients with specific chronic diseases. Reduced food intake and altered metabolism in
cancer patients puts them at risk for weight loss and is associated with unique complications
including decreased response to therapy and increased toxicity of chemotherapy (often requir-
ing decreased doses, limiting effectiveness) [41,42]. Clinical trials have shown cancer patients
provided nutrition therapy supplemented with nutrients supporting immune function to have
reduced risks of complications, decreased length of antibiotic therapy, and shortened length of
stay [43–45]. A recent review completed by a Task Force formed by the European Respiratory
Society determined proper nutrition in COPD patients can have pulmonary, metabolic, and
cardiovascular risk benefits [46]. Compared to typical therapy, nutritional therapy combined
with exercise reduced hospital costs in muscle-wasted COPD patients [47]. Older patients with
acute ischemic stroke provided an enteral formula including whey protein had better clinical
outcomes compared to patients provided the same formula with protein coming from casein
[48].
Our study is a model, and thus reflects estimates based on public data versus actual costs cal-
culated from individual patient charges. Some of the limitations of our study include the lim-
ited number of diseases considered, medical cost estimates from the literature (as opposed to
primary data), the limited variation in the marginal cost of malnutrition by disease state, and
the lack of a universally accepted definition of malnutrition. Additionally, our model estimates
aggregate direct medical costs borne by society, but is agnostic about how those costs are dis-
tributed between payers, consumer and government.
Conclusions
The findings are important to state policy makers and those involved in healthcare decision-
making roles focused on reducing healthcare costs. The joint area of clinical nutrition support
and health economics is emerging, and is needed for value-based healthcare decisions. Under
healthcare payment reform, healthcare providers are held accountable for both costs and qual-
ity [49]. Our study is one of the first to quantify the state-level burden of DAM. It comes at a
critical time when continued implementation of U.S. healthcare reform provides an opportu-
nity to bring increased awareness to malnutrition-related issues in the healthcare system so
they can be addressed and help improve patient health outcomes and lower healthcare costs.
