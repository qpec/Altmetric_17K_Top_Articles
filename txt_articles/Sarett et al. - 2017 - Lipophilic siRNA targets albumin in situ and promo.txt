Clinical translation of therapies based on small interfering RNA
(siRNA) is hampered by siRNA’s comprehensively poor pharmacokinetic
properties, which necessitate molecule modifications and complex
delivery strategies. We sought an alternative approach to commonly
used nanoparticle carriers by leveraging the long-lived endogenous
serum protein albumin as an siRNA carrier. We synthesized siRNA
conjugated to a diacyl lipid moiety (siRNA-L2), which rapidly binds
albumin in situ. siRNA-L2, in comparison with unmodified siRNA,
exhibited a 5.7-fold increase in circulation half-life, an 8.6-fold in-
crease in bioavailability, and reduced renal accumulation. Bench-
marked against leading commercial siRNA nanocarrier in vivo jetPEI,
siRNA-L2 achieved 19-fold greater tumor accumulation and 46-fold in-
crease in per-tumor-cell uptake in a mouse orthotopic model of human
triple-negative breast cancer. siRNA-L2 penetrated tumor tissue rapidly
and homogeneously; 30 min after i.v. injection, siRNA-L2 achieved up-
take in 99% of tumor cells, compared with 60% for jetPEI. Remarkably,
siRNA-L2 achieved a tumor:liver accumulation ratio >40:1 vs. <3:1 for
jetPEI. The improved pharmacokinetic properties of siRNA-L2 facilitated
significant tumor gene silencing for 7 d after two i.v. doses. Proof-of-
concept was extended to a patient-derived xenograft model, in which
jetPEI tumor accumulation was reduced fourfold relative to the same
formulation in the orthotopic model. The siRNA-L2 tumor accumula-
tion diminished only twofold, suggesting that the superior tumor
distribution of the conjugate over nanoparticles will be accentuated
in clinical situations. These data reveal the immense promise of in situ
albumin targeting for development of translational, carrier-free RNAi-
based cancer therapies.

arnessing the therapeutic potential of small interfering RNA
(siRNA) hinges upon enhancing its pharmacokinetic prop-
erties to overcome in vivo delivery barriers. Unmodified siRNA
exhibits rapid renal clearance from circulation, leading to re-
moval through the urine (1) and allowing minimal bioavailability
in target tissues. Improving delivery of siRNA via encapsulation
in nanoparticulate carrier systems has been the principal strategy
used by the field. Nanocarriers can improve circulation half-life,
resistance to degradation, intracellular uptake, and ultimately
gene silencing potency (2–5). However, commonly used cationic
lipid/polymer formulations are complex and expensive to syn-
thesize and can be toxic and/or immunogenic (6, 7). Additionally,
their preferential uptake by clearance organs such as the liver
and spleen hinders delivery to target tissues (4, 8). siRNA con-
jugates have emerged as an alternative to nanocarrier-mediated
delivery (9–14), offering the possibility of improving siRNA
pharmacokinetics without requiring a more complex delivery
vehicle. Alnylam Pharmaceuticals has demonstrated high gene
silencing potency of a trivalent N-Acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)
siRNA conjugate, which binds with high specificity and affinity
to the asialoglycoprotein receptor on hepatocytes (15, 16).
Carrier-free gene silencing has also been achieved in the liver
with siRNA–cholesterol conjugates (1, 14), but the develop-
ment of siRNA conjugates that efficiently deliver to nonhepatic
tissues is an unmet need. Here, we developed an siRNA conju-
gate that leverages endogenous albumin as a chaperone. We
anticipate that albumin-associated siRNA will show particular
promise as a cancer therapeutic by extending the circulation time of
siRNA, enabling efficient tumor tissue penetration, and leveraging
the propensity of tumor cells to internalize albumin (17, 18).
The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, based
upon the high vascular permeability and diminished lymphatic
drainage at tumor sites, suggests a preferential tumor accumu-
lation of particles of nanocarrier size (∼100 nm). However, the
EPR phenomenon as a tumor targeting strategy has recently come
under intense scrutiny due to the discrepancy observed between
preclinical and clinical efficacy of nanoparticle-based cancer thera-
peutics (19–22). There is a growing appreciation that among wildly
heterogeneous human cancers, the EPR effect may be only relevant
in select tumor or patient subsets. In particular, the widespread
“leakiness” of tumor vasculature, a characteristic of rapidly de-
veloping mouse tumor models, has likely been exaggerated in its
relevance to slower-forming human lesions (23). The field of
nanomedicine has responded to these realizations with efforts to
Significance
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) has the capacity to silence tra-
ditionally undruggable targets, but in vivo delivery barriers
limit clinical translation of siRNA, especially for nonhepatic
targets such as solid tumors. Most delivery strategies for RNAi
cancer therapies focus on synthetic nanocarriers, but their
shortcomings include limited delivery to and variable distri-
bution throughout the target site and low therapeutic indices
due to nonspecific, carrier-associated toxicities. A diacyl lipid-
modified siRNA can leverage albumin as an endogenous car-
rier, resulting in comprehensively enhanced pharmacokinetic
properties that translate to greater quantity and homogeneity
of tumor accumulation relative to nanocarriers. The albumin-
binding siRNA conjugate strategy is synthetically simple and
safe at high doses, and thus is a translatable and potentially
transformative option for RNAi oncology therapies.

 enhance understanding of nanoparticle performance in animal
models (24–27), strategies to normalize tumor vasculature (28),
systematic investigations into ideal nanoparticle characteristics
(24, 29), and a focus on smaller (20–30-nm-sized) nanocarriers
(24, 30, 31). Despite the promise of these approaches, the di-
versity of human cancers necessitates equivalently diverse de-
livery approaches (23, 32) and opportunity for improvement remains,
particularly in the area of enhancing uniformity of tumor distribution.
Nanoparticles typically exhibit concentration of dose near leaky
vessels but not within more avascular tumor regions (33, 34),
resulting in inhomogeneous efficacy and higher potential for in-
complete remission and recurrence. Smaller, long-circulating siRNA
conjugates may offer an alternative that creates more homogeneous
therapeutic distribution within tumors. Indeed, the apparent tissue
permeability of the serum protein albumin [hydrodynamic size
∼7.2 nm (35)] is consistently more than fourfold greater than
that of 100-nm liposomes in a variety of mouse models of breast
cancer (36). Here, we sought to design an siRNA conjugate that
“hitchhikes” on long-circulating albumin to confer siRNA mol-
ecules with an unprecedented combination of circulation per-
sistence and high tissue penetration to enable systemic,
carrier-free delivery of siRNA for oncological applications.
In situ targeting of albumin following i.v. delivery is a viable
strategy because endogenous albumin is the most abundant se-
rum protein (>40 mg/mL) and has a circulation half-life of about
20 d (37). It is also a natural carrier of and has a high affinity for
poorly soluble lipids (35, 37). Albumin has been investigated
extensively as a carrier and a conjugate for small molecules as
well as protein therapeutics; albumin-based therapeutics like
Abraxane, Levemir, and Optison have achieved clinical rele-
vance (35, 38), demonstrating the translatability of this approach.
Previous work has established the utility of interaction of high-
and low-density lipoproteins with cholesterol-conjugated siRNA
(14, 39–42), but the natural trafficking of these lipoproteins
concentrates the therapy in the hepatocytes of the liver. The
potential of albumin-bound siRNA has been minimally explored
(42, 43). In our unique strategy, we exploit the capacity of al-
bumin to bind fatty acids by modifying siRNA with a lipidic
moiety designed for high-affinity albumin binding. Previously,
this hydrophobic modification for in situ albumin targeting was
used to promote delivery of CpG DNA to lymph nodes for
vaccine applications (44). We pursued modification of siRNA
with a lipidic albumin-targeting agent rather than alternative
albumin-binding molecules like peptide domains (45) and a
truncated Evans blue molecule (46) because hydrophobically
modified siRNA exhibits improved resistance to nucleases and
enhanced cellular internalization (10). Thus, the strategic choice
of modification with an albumin-binding lipid has the potential
to confer additional advantages in siRNA stability and cell
membrane interactions for uptake and endosomal escape in
addition to circulation persistence, tissue penetration, and bio-
distribution. To investigate the clinical potential of our siRNA
conjugate, we examined its efficacy as a systemic RNAi cancer
therapeutic by evaluating delivery and gene silencing in transla-
tionally relevant models of human triple-negative breast cancer.
Results
Purified siRNA-L2 Conjugate Binds to Albumin. To synthesize siRNA
conjugated to a diacyl lipid moiety (siRNA-L2), a single-stranded amine-
modified siRNA was reacted with an NHS ester/dibenzocyclooctyne
heterobifunctional cross-linker and subsequently conjugated with
1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[azido(poly-
ethylene glycol)-2000] (DSPE-PEG2000-azide) to generate siRNA-L2
(Fig. 1A and SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). The fully purified L2 conju-
gates were obtained by reverse-phase chromatography and purity
was confirmed by mass spectrometry (Fig. 1B and SI Appendix,
Fig. S1B). Following purification, sense strand siRNA-L2 was
annealed to the corresponding antisense strand (for imaging
studies, the antisense strand was Cy5-labeled). It was confirmed
that conjugation of the L2 moiety to siRNA did not significantly
impact its inherent gene silencing activity, as demonstrated by
in vitro knockdown evaluation of siRNA and siRNA-L2 de-
livered via the commercial transfection reagent in vivo jetPEI
(SI Appendix, Fig. S1C).
The albumin-binding capacity of siRNA-L2 was confirmed using
a nondenaturing, native PAGE assay (Fig. 1C and SI Appendix, Fig.
S2A). siRNA-L2 alone migrates above the albumin band because
it exists as a micellar population at the concentration loaded into
the gel (0.05 mg/mL), whereas critical micelle concentration is
1.4 μg/mL (SI Appendix, Fig. S2B). As the albumin:siRNA-L2
ratio increases, more siRNA-L2 binds to and migrates with albu-
min. Unmodified siRNA does not bind to albumin to any degree at
any of the concentrations tested. Evaluation of siRNA-L2 binding to
albumin via isothermal calorimetry further confirmed spontaneous
association of the molecules (dissociation constant was 1.38 μM; SI
Appendix, Fig. S2C). Binding of L2 conjugates to albumin in the
presence of complete serum was also evaluated by gel migration
assay, revealing preferential binding to the albumin component of
serum (SI Appendix, Fig. S3A).
Albumin Binding of siRNA-L2 Enhances Circulation Time and Reduces
Rapid Renal Clearance. To characterize the in vivo pharmacoki-
netics of siRNA-L2 in comparison with unmodified siRNA, cir-
culation persistence was evaluated in real time using intravital
confocal microscopy following i.v. injection. The circulation

 half-life (t1/2) of siRNA-L2 was 5.7-fold longer than unmodified
siRNA (Fig. 2 A and B and Table 1). Additionally, the area under
the curve, a measure of bioavailability of systemically delivered
therapeutics, was 8.6-fold greater for the L2-conjugate compared
with unmodified oligonucleotide. To evaluate in situ albumin
binding, serum samples from mice injected with siRNA-L2 (blood
collection at 20 min postinjection) were evaluated via PAGE gel
migration assay and revealed the presence of albumin-bound
siRNA-L2 (SI Appendix, Fig. S3B). These data confirm that al-
bumin acts as a chaperone for siRNA-L2 in vivo and establish
that siRNA-L2 association with albumin confers significant
improvements in siRNA pharmacokinetics. To support these
studies, the time scale of degradation of unmodified and L2-
modified oligonucleotides was investigated. siRNA and siRNA-L2
showed resistance to degradation in serum over the pharmaco-
kinetic time frame assessed, and L2 modification imparted a
slight improvement in resistance to serum degradation (SI
Appendix, Fig. S3 C and D).
Biodistribution of siRNA vs. siRNA-L2 was evaluated in ex-
cised organs at 20 min postinjection. For in vivo studies, siRNA-L2
exhibited increased accumulation in almost all organs, likely
due to its prolonged circulation time and reduced clearance into
the urine in comparison with unmodified siRNA (Fig. 2C). The
kidneys were the sole exception, showing significantly more un-
modified siRNA accumulation (a 1.6-fold greater fraction of the
total organ radiance) at this early time point. This illustrates that
using albumin as a natural carrier for siRNA-L2 reduces acute
clearance through the renal route.
siRNA-L2 Outperforms a Leading in Vivo Nanoparticle Carrier in Safety
and Tumor Accumulation. The reduction in kidney accumulation
and prolonged circulation half-life of siRNA-L2 motivated a com-
parison with commercially available in vivo nanoparticles. Of
particular interest is the biodistribution profile of siRNA-L2 in
comparison with typical nanocarriers, as high uptake by mono-
nuclear phagocytic system organs (the liver and the spleen) can
result in minimal dose accumulation at the target site (47).
Compared with nanoparticles, siRNA-L2 is expected to avoid
this off-target accumulation and to more readily penetrate tumor
tissue.
siRNA-L2 was compared with a leading formulation for
nanoparticle-based in vivo nucleic acid delivery, in vivo jetPEI.
In vivo jetPEI nanoparticles (jetPEI NPs) have been used in
clinical trials, and this comparison is therefore a stringent test for
therapeutic potential (48). Before in vivo biodistribution studies,
tolerated doses were determined for siRNA-L2 and jetPEI NPs.
siRNA-L2 is expected to avoid the toxic side effects associated with
high doses of cationic nanocarriers, permitting safe use at higher
dosages and potentially expanding the ultimate therapeutic index of
siRNA drugs. Toxicity was investigated by monitoring mouse body
weight and quantifying blood chemistry markers of liver [alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)]
and kidney [blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine] toxicity.
Mice injected with an siRNA-L2 dose of 10 mg/kg exhibited normal
ALT, AST, and BUN levels statistically equivalent to those of
saline-injected mice; these mice also showed no change in body
weight (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 A–E). Delivery of jetPEI NPs at a
dose of 1 mg/kg created no signs of toxicity, but doubling that
dose to 2 mg/kg resulted in mortality for three of four mice and
showed marked hepatic and renal toxicity in the single surviving
mouse. These data suggest that siRNA-L2 is a safer alternative to
nanocarrier-based delivery with the potential for a much broader
therapeutic index. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 1 mg/kg
for in vivo jetPEI and a well-tolerated dose of 10 mg/kg for
siRNA-L2 were used in subsequent studies (MTD not determined
for siRNA-L2).
The biodistribution profile of the L2 conjugate vs. jetPEI NPs was
evaluated in a mouse orthotopic xenograft tumor model. siRNA-L2
or jetPEI NPs were injected i.v. into tumor-bearing mice and organs
were evaluated for siRNA accumulation. Comparing the absolute
radiance in the organs over time from mice treated with jetPEI NPs
or siRNA-L2, it is evident that the 10-mg/kg treatment of siRNA-L2
significantly enhances accumulation in all of the organs at an acute
(30 min) time point (Fig. 3A and SI Appendix, Figs. S5 and S6A).
Notably, the vast majority of siRNA-L2 was cleared from all organs
excepting the kidneys and tumors by 24 h (Fig. 3A and SI Appendix,
Fig. S6). jetPEI NPs, in contrast, create higher proportional delivery
to and retention within the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS)
clearance organs (the liver and spleen) (Fig. 3B).
The in vivo tolerability of high siRNA-L2 doses enables a re-
markable increase in tumor accumulation (Fig. 3 C and D). The
area under the curve within the tumor was 19.3-fold higher for
siRNA-L2 at 10 mg/kg than for the maximum tolerated dose of
jetPEI NPs (Table 2). Dose-matched siRNA-L2 at 1 mg/kg also
outperforms jetPEI NPs in this measure of tumor accumulation
by 2.4-fold. Additionally, the fraction of the total organ radiance
in the tumors is consistently higher for siRNA-L2 at both doses
compared with jetPEI NPs, indicating more preferential tumor
accumulation with siRNA-L2 relative to jetPEI NPs.
To further annotate the ability of siRNA-L2 to avoid the typical
MPS organ accumulation of nanoparticles and accumulate prefer-
entially within tumors, we evaluated the tumor:liver radiance ratio.
At the 10-mg/kg siRNA-L2 dose, a tumor:liver accumulation
of more than 40:1 was observed at both 24 and 48 h, indicating

 successful accumulation at a nonhepatic site (Fig. 3 E and F
and Table 2). In contrast, jetPEI NPs displayed a tumor:liver
ratio of below 3:1, a more than 15-fold decrease compared
with siRNA-L2 at 10 mg/kg and also lower than that observed
for siRNA-L2 at 1 mg/kg (which achieved a tumor:liver ratio
of ∼15:1).
The clear superiority of siRNA-L2 in the orthotopic model
motivated investigation in a more clinically relevant patient-
derived xenograft (PDX) model of triple-negative breast can-
cer. Dose-matched siRNA-L2 and in vivo jetPEI NPs at 1 mg/kg
were injected i.v. and biodistribution was evaluated at 24 h.
siRNA-L2 attained 4.0-fold greater tumor distribution in the
PDX model than jetPEI NPs (whereas there was a 2.2-fold in-
creased tumor delivery in the dose-matched orthotopic model) at
24 h (Fig. 3 G and H and SI Appendix, Fig. S7A). Compared with
the orthotopic model, achieving tumor accumulation in the PDX
model was more challenging. The added challenge of PDX tu-
mors was more detrimental for the tumor delivery with jetPEI
NPs than siRNA-L2. Total tumor accumulation in PDX tumors
was 4.3-fold lower than orthotopic tumors for jetPEI NPs
whereas it was only reduced by 2.4 fold for siRNA-L2. The lower
MPS accumulation of siRNA-L2 relative to NPs was consistent
in the PDX model, with siRNA-L2 again showing a marked
improvement in tumor:liver ratio (8:1 vs. 1:1) (SI Appendix,
Fig. S7B).
siRNA-L2 Exhibits Homogeneous Distribution and High Cellular
Internalization at the Tumor Site. The small size of albumin-
bound siRNA-L2 is expected to increase tumor tissue pene-
tration and homogeneity of distribution over nanoparticles.
Using an in vitro tumor spheroid model, the penetration and
distribution of siRNA-L2 vs. jetPEI NPs throughout 3D tumor
architecture was evaluated. The siRNA-L2 showed homoge-
neous and substantial cell uptake throughout the entirety of
spheroids, whereas jetPEI NPs remained localized largely around
the edges of the spheroid (Fig. 4A). Unmodified siRNA showed
improved penetration into the interstitial spaces compared with
the jetPEI complexes, but exhibited lower overall fluorescence than
siRNA-L2 (SI Appendix, Fig. S8A). To complement these re-
sults, flow cytometry was used to measure uptake per cell (as
quantified by mean intracellular fluorescence) in tumor spheroids
that were dissociated and analyzed following siRNA formulation
treatment. The cellular internalization of siRNA-L2 was twofold
higher than that of unmodified siRNA, evidencing an uptake
benefit derived from hydrophobic modification (SI Appendix, Fig.
S8B). Compared with jetPEI NPs, siRNA-L2 exhibited a greater
than fivefold uptake increase (Fig. 4B), with 84% of siRNA-L2–
treated cells positive for uptake compared with 27% of jetPEI-
NP–treated cells (SI Appendix, Fig. S8 C and D).
These in vitro tumor spheroid results inspired an investigation
of tumor penetration and homogeneity of internalization by cells
within orthotopic breast tumors in vivo. Following i.v. injection
of siRNA-L2 or jetPEI NPs, cells were isolated from excised tumors
and evaluated by flow cytometry for cellular internalization. Tumor
cells were identified by expression of green fluorescent protein
(GFP). siRNA-L2 outperformed jetPEI NPs at both 30 min and
24 h, with siRNA-L2 at 1 mg/kg displaying 5- and 2-fold increased
uptake at respective time points and siRNA-L2 at 10 mg/kg showing
45- and 20-fold increased uptake (Fig. 4C and Table 2). At 30 min,
mice treated with siRNA-L2 at either dose displayed uptake in more
than 96% of tumor cells, whereas jetPEI-NP–treated mice showed
uptake in only 60% of cells (SI Appendix, Fig. S8E). The prefer-
ential and homogeneous distribution of siRNA-L2 to tumor sites
and high uptake by tumor cells makes it ideally suited for cancer
therapies.
siRNA-L2 Elicits Sustained Silencing in an in Vivo Tumor Model. The
promising tumor penetration characteristics of siRNA-L2 in-
spired examination of its gene silencing efficacy in vivo in an
orthotopic mouse tumor model. After treatment with luciferase-
targeted siRNA or siRNA-L2 at days 0 and 1, luminescence was
evaluated over 7 d, where an increase in luminescence indicates
tumor growth and successful luciferase silencing abrogates the in-
crease in luminescent signal. siRNA-L2–treated tumors exhibited
significantly reduced tumor luminescence in comparison with tu-
mors treated with unmodified luciferase-targeting siRNA or in-
active, control siRNA-L2 sequences (Fig. 4D and SI Appendix, Fig.
S9A). Comparing to the scrambled siRNA-L2 control, maximum
silencing was more than 60% at day 1, with nearly 50% silencing
sustained at day 7, revealing the prolonged gene silencing capacity
of siRNA-L2. No change in mouse body weight was observed over
the course of treatment, further indicating that siRNA-L2 treatment

 is well-tolerated (SI Appendix, Fig. S9B). Treatment with jetPEI
NPs at a dose of 1 mg/kg elicited significant (∼30%) silencing at day
3, but silencing was fully abrogated by day 7 (SI Appendix, Fig. S9C).
As an initial proof-of-concept of activity against a therapeutically
relevant gene, siRNA-L2 that targets the negative regulator of ap-
optosis, myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein (MCL-1), was
synthesized. The siRNA-L2 against MCL-1 achieved significant
gene silencing in vitro at a reasonably low, 200-nM dose, and
MCL-1 silencing correlated with a trend of functional increase
in caspase activity (SI Appendix, Fig. S10).
Discussion
Simple conjugation of a hydrophobic albumin-binding diacyl lipid
moiety to siRNA is a powerful delivery strategy to improve the
pharmacokinetic properties of siRNA. L2 conjugation increases
circulation half-life, cellular internalization capacity, and tumor
penetration and retention of siRNA while simultaneously reducing
accumulation in clearance organs. These myriad benefits lead to
enhanced and prolonged in vivo gene silencing in tumors, sup-
porting siRNA-L2 as a potential cancer therapy that can act on
currently undruggable targets.
Leveraging albumin as an endogenous nanocarrier is a rela-
tively recent but extremely promising strategy to extend the cir-
culation persistence of therapeutics. Clinically relevant examples
range from Abraxane, an albumin-based nanoparticle that en-
capsulates Taxol, to Levemir, a therapeutic peptide modified to
associate noncovalently with endogenous albumin (35). siRNA,
with its high potential medical impact but characteristically short
circulation half-life, is an ideal candidate to develop with albu-
min as an in vivo chaperone. Inducing high-affinity binding of
siRNA to albumin via modification with a lipidic moiety is a logical
strategy. Previous work has shown siRNA amenable to lipid mod-
ifications, which often confer improvements in nuclease resistance
and cellular internalization without impacting gene silencing (10, 14,
49, 50). Conjugation with L2 therefore has potential benefits on
enhancing molecule stability and uptake while also prompting in
situ albumin binding. Notably, this binding is noncovalent and dy-
namic. In its physiological role as a fatty acid carrier, albumin fa-
cilitates the cellular uptake of lipids, likely through a variety of
mechanisms that use receptors for both albumin and lipid domains
(51, 52). Conjugation of L2 could allow siRNA-L2 to hijack these
natural pathways. Additionally, the hydrophobic interaction of the
L2 moiety with the cellular membrane could encourage siRNA-L2
to be internalized independent of albumin.
L2 modification as an albumin targeting approach is desirable
for achieving pharmacokinetic improvements while maintaining
simplicity and safety. Despite the synthetic complexity of nano-
particle systems, siRNA-L2 possesses a circulation half-life above
that of non–cross-linked polyion nanoparticles (4, 53) and nearly
equivalent to that observed in a relatively intricate cross-linked
micelle system using cholesterol-modified siRNA (3). Perhaps
more striking is the complete lack of toxicity observed for
siRNA-L2 at doses of 10 mg/kg, which sharply contrasts with the
reported toxicity and immunogenicity of nanoparticulate carriers
and our direct evaluation of in vivo jetPEI (25, 54). siRNA-L2
couples an improved circulation half-life with a lack of dose-
limiting side effects, and therefore is anticipated to enable very
broad therapeutic windows when developed against specific
targets. Our demonstration of MCL-1 gene silencing and its link
to caspase induction demonstrates the applicability of siRNA-L2
to such therapeutic targets. Additionally, we expect that the ef-
ficacy of siRNA-L2 could be further optimized through modifi-
cations to enhance in vivo stability and through identification of
siRNA sequences with extremely potent silencing (55, 56).
Another associated challenge with nanoparticle delivery sys-
tems is their preferential accumulation within clearance organs,
specifically the liver and spleen (8). Accumulation of synthetic
and toxic/immunogenic nanoparticle components in these organs
is the typical cause of dose-limiting toxicities. However, siRNA-L2
avoids capture in the MPS organs, which is characteristic of
nanoparticles, while also exhibiting a significant reduction in the
Fig. 4.

Sarett et al.
 rapid renal clearance associated with unmodified siRNA de-
livery. This is exemplified by the tumor:liver accumulation ratio
of more than 40:1 achieved by siRNA-L2. The disparity between
in vivo jetPEI, with a ratio of less than 3:1, is pronounced. The
lack of siRNA-L2 retention in the liver is a key advantage over
nanoparticulate delivery systems and will allow a greater per-
centage of the injected dose to be retained at its site of action in
tumors. The lower tumor:liver ratio observed with in vivo jetPEI
and nanoparticle systems in the literature is consistent with
reported challenges in achieving efficient nanoparticle delivery
to tumor sites; in a comprehensive analysis of nanoparticle de-
livery to solid tumors, the median injected dose delivered to the
tumor site was 0.7% (47). It is notable that even in recent, ad-
vanced, and promising nanoparticle systems, including those
that use modifications for “stealth” or targeting mechanisms,
the ratio of tumor:liver accumulation is consistently close to or
below 1:1 (3, 5, 57–62). The marked improvement of siRNA-L2 in
relative tumor accumulation supports its translational promise.
There is also a significant tumor penetration benefit of siRNA-L2
due to its small size relative to nanoparticle carriers. Whereas in vivo
jetPEI displays poor penetration of tumor tissue, siRNA-L2 distrib-
utes homogeneously throughout tumor tissue and achieves consis-
tently high uptake in tumor cells. The capacity of siRNA-L2 to offer
superior tumor penetration is particularly significant given the highly
inconsistent nature of human tumor vasculature and tissue mor-
phology which limits consistent nanoparticle distribution (47, 63).
Here, we note that the PDX mouse model is less permissive to de-
livery than the orthotopic model. PDX models are considered more
clinically relevant, as they preserve the native tissue architecture of
the primary tumor through multiple in vivo passages and consistently
recapitulate histopathologic and molecular characteristics, including
drug responses and metastatic potential (64). The more challenging
nature of the PDX model relative to the orthotopic model [which is
considered more stringent than the flank model (21)] aligns with
recent discussion suggesting that the permeable nature of commonly
used mouse tumor models has led to an overestimation of the EPR
effect (19, 20). Whereas nanocarriers like in vivo jetPEI may achieve
efficacy in highly vascularized or nonsolid tumors (20), they lack the
ability to diffuse throughout the bulk of tumor architecture. Faced
with a more difficult delivery challenge in the PDX model, siRNA-L2
maintains tumor accumulation better than does in vivo jetPEI. As the
majority of human solid tumors contain regions of poor vasculari-
zation and display disparity in vessel permeability (20, 21), the
performance of siRNA-L2 in the PDX model suggests applica-
bility to a much broader range of cancers. A recognition of the
limitations of the EPR effect and a developing understanding of
tumor heterogeneity calls for innovative solutions for systemic
RNAi cancer therapies. siRNA-L2 deviates enormously from the
standard nanoparticle format, and its notable advantages should
inspire further research into similar conjugate-based strategies.
In situ targeting of albumin as an endogenous carrier is a pow-
erful strategy to enhance the bioavailability of siRNA and avoid the
issues associated with synthetic nanocarriers. siRNA-L2 surpasses
conventional delivery systems in circulation persistence, safety,
biodistribution profile, tumor penetration, and cellular internaliza-
tion. Ultimately, siRNA-L2 achieves sustained gene silencing in
tumors in vivo, providing strong proof-of-concept for therapeutic
efficacy. This work highlights the immense value of the siRNA-L2
conjugate as a translational and potentially transformative approach
to improve i.v. RNAi cancer therapies.
Materials and Methods
Materials. Amine-modified single-stranded DNA (modification at 5′ end) or
RNA (modification at 3′ end) and complementary single-stranded Cy5-, un-
modified DNA, or unmodified RNA was obtained from Integrated DNA Tech-
nologies (for DNA) or GE Dharmacon. The pGreenFire1-CMV plasmid was
obtained from System Biosciences, and packaging plasmids pMDLg/pRRE, pRSV-
Rev, and pMD2.G were purchased from Addgene. In vivo jetPEI was purchased
from VWR International. The product 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanol-
amine-N-[azido(polyethylene glycol)-2000] (DSPE-PEG2000-azide) was purchased
from Avanti Polar Lipids. NucBlue Fixed Cell ReadyProbes were purchased from
Life Technologies. NAP-25 filtration columns were purchased from Fisher
Scientific. RNeasy Mini Kit was purchased from Qiagen, iScript cDNA Syn-
thesis Kit from BioRad Laboratories, and Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay from Prom-
ega Corporation. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Oligonucleotide-L2 Synthesis. Single-stranded amine-modified oligo was
reacted with 10-fold molar excess of dibenzocyclooctyne-PEG4-N-hydroxy-
succinimidyl ester (DBCO-PEG4-NHS) predissolved at 25 mM in DMSO. The
reaction was carried out for 18 h at room temperature at a 1 mM oligonu-
cleotide concentration in 30% DMSO and 70% PBS with 8 mM triethylamine.
The product was diluted threefold in water and filtered twice through NAP-
25 columns, lyophilized, and then reacted with fivefold molar excess of DSPE-
PEG2000-azide for 24 h at a 0.1 mM oligonucleotide concentration in 50%
methanol, 50% water. The reaction was diluted and filtered one time through a
NAP-25 column and then purified with reversed-phase HPLC using a Clarity
Oligo-RP column (Phenomenex) under a linear gradient from 95% water (50 mM
triethylammonium acetate), 5% methanol to 100% methanol. The conjugate
molecular weight was confirmed using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Voyager-
DE STR Workstation) using 50 mg/mL 3-hydroxypicolinic acid in 50% water, 50%
acetonitrile with 5 mg/mL ammonium citrate as a matrix. The yield of the oligo-
L2 was quantified based on absorbance at 260 nm. The purified oligo-L2 was
annealed to its complementary strand to generate Cy5-modified, unmodi-
fied DNA-L2, or siRNA-L2. Conjugation and annealing was also confirmed via
agarose gel electrophoresis.
DNA was used as a cost-effective analog for siRNA in imaging studies, and
is referred to as siRNA/siRNA-L2 in the main text and SI Appendix for sim-
plicity and cohesion (except where the figure is intended to show a direct
comparison between DNA and siRNA). DNA/siRNA and DNA-L2/siRNA-L2
exhibited degradation on similar time scales (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 C and D)
and DNA-L2 exhibits similar albumin binding (SI Appendix, Fig. S2B), vali-
dating its use as a model for siRNA-L2.
Oligonucleotide-L2 characterization. Critical micelle concentration (CMC) of
oligo-L2 was assessed fluorescently using Nile red, as described previously
(65, 66). Briefly, different dilutions were prepared from a 1 mg/mL stock
solution to obtain micelle samples ranging in concentration from 0.0001 to
1 mg/mL Then, 10 μL of a 1 mg/mL Nile red stock solution in methanol was
added to 1 mL of each sample and incubated overnight in the dark at room
temperature. The next day, samples were filtered with a 0.45-μm syringe
filter, and Nile red fluorescence was measured in 96-well plates using a
microplate reader (Tecan Infinite 500, Tecan Group Ltd.) at an excitation
wavelength of 535 ± 20 nm and an emission wavelength of 612 ± 25 nm. The
CMC was defined, as previously described (67), as the intersection point on
the plot of the Nile red fluorescence versus the copolymer concentration.
Degradation of siRNA and siRNA-L2 was assessed by incubation in 60% FBS
for 4 h, 2 h, 1 h, 30 min, or 15 min and evaluation by agarose gel electro-
phoresis with comparison with a control sample in water.
Evaluation of albumin binding to oligo-L2 in vitro. PAGE gel migration assay was
used to assess binding of oligo-L2 to BSA. Mini-Protean TGX Precast Gels of
4–20% were run in the Tetra Blotting Module (BioRad). siRNA, siRNA-L2,
DNA, and DNA-L2 were incubated with varying amounts of BSA for 15 min.
PAGE gels were stained using GelRed Nucleic Acid Stain (Biotium) according
to manufacturer protocol and imaged under UV light for visualization of
nucleic acid migration. Gels were subsequently stained with Coomassie blue
to evaluate BSA migration.
PAGE gel migration assay was used to assess binding of oligo-L2 to albumin
in serum. siRNA or siRNA-L2 was incubated with 9- or 13-fold molar excess
BSA or 50% or 75% FBS (for approximate matching of mass of protein
loaded per well). siRNA and siRNA-L2 were imaged under UV light after
poststaining with GelRed. Serum proteins were stained with Coomassie blue.
Isothermal calorimetry (ITC) experiments were performed using a TA Instru-
ments Nano ITC. Oligo-L2 was prepared at a concentration of 0.1 mM and BSA was
dissolved at a concentration of 0.25 mM from lyophilized powder in PBS. Titration
experiments were carried out at 37 °C with a 300-s initial delay, 150-rpm stirring
speed, and a sample cell volume (containing DNA-L2) of 300 μL. Each injection was
2 μL, with an injection interval of 180 s. Data were analyzed using an independent
binding site model with a blank constant correction incorporated to account for
heat of dilution. All data analysis was performed in Nano ITC software.
Cell Culture. Human epithelial breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) were cul-
tured in DMEM (Gibco Cell Culture) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco) and
0.1% gentamicin (Gibco). Luciferase-expressing MDA-MB-231s were gener-
ated as previously described (5).

 In Vitro Gene Silencing. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with siRNA or siRNA-
L2 complexed with in vivo jetPEI according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
The siRNA was either designed against the luciferase gene (luc siRNA) or was
a scrambled sequence (scr siRNA). Cells were seeded at 2,000 cells/well in 96-
well black-walled plates and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were then
treated in 10% serum for 24 h at a dose of 100 or 50 nM siRNA. After 24 h,
media was replaced with luciferin-containing media (150 μg/mL) before
imaging with an IVIS Lumina III imaging system at 24 and 48 h.
To evaluate silencing of a therapeutically relevant gene, siRNA targeting
MCL-1 was used. MCF7 cells were treated with MCL-1-targeted or a scrambled
control siRNA-L2 at 200 nM in 10% serum-containing media for 24 h. At 48 h,
RNA was harvested and MCL-1 mRNA levels were evaluated using quanti-
tative real time PCR. In parallel, caspase activity was measured at 48 h using
the Caspase Glo 3/7 Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.
Evaluation of albumin binding to oligo-L2 in vivo. Fluorescent (Cy-5-labeled) DNA
and DNA-L2 was injected into the tail vein of CD-1 mice (4–6-wk-old, Charles
Rivers Laboratories) at 1 mg/kg. Blood was collected at 20 min postinjection,
and serum was isolated. Serum from mice injected with DNA, DNA-L2, or
saline was evaluated via PAGE gel migration assay to assess binding of oligo-
L2 to albumin in vivo.

Collection)
were
cultured
in
DMEM
supplemented
with
1%
penicillin-
streptomycin and 10% FBS. Three-dimensional MCF7 spheroid cultures were
established as described previously (68, 69). Briefly, cells were grown to 50%
confluence in 2D culture. Cells were washed twice with trypsin (0.05%, Gibco),
trypsin was aspirated, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 10–15 min. Cells were
resuspended in growth medium, pipetted to generate single-cell suspensions,
and counted (Bio-Rad TC20 Automated Cell Counter). Single-cell suspensions
(7,500 cells per 500 μL) were seeded in eight-well chamber slides (Nunc Lab-Tek
II) precoated with 10 μL growth-factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) in
growth media containing 2% growth-factor-reduced Matrigel and cultured for
5 d. The 8-well chamber slides were used for evaluation by confocal microscopy;
the setup was scaled up to 12-well plates for flow cytometry and down to
96-well plates for cytotoxicity studies.
To evaluate tumor spheroid penetration by confocal microscopy, on day 5,
cultures were treated with 100 nM Cy5-labeled DNA, DNA-L2, or DNA
complexed with in vivo jetPEI for 4 h in fresh growth medium. Cultures were
washed once with PBS and fixed for 2 min with BD Cyotfix/Cytoperm solu-
tion (BD Biosciences). After aspirating fixative and removing the plastic
chamber, cultures on slides were mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade with
DAPI (Molecular Probes) and secured by coverslip. Slides were stored at 4 °C
before confocal imaging. Confocal imaging was performed using the Nikon
C1si+ system on a Nikon Eclipse Ti-0E inverted microscopy base. The pho-
tomultiplier tube voltage, laser power, and image display settings were set
for maximal signal-to-noise ratio based on control biological samples such
that negative control samples lacking label had no background fluorescence
and treatment samples had no saturated pixels. Image acquisition and
analysis were performed using Nikon NIS Elements AR version 4.30.01.
To evaluate tumor spheroid penetration by flow cytometry, on day 5,
cultures were treated as described above. Cultures were washed once with
PBS and tumor cells were dissociated from Matrigel for evaluation of
Cy5 fluorescence.
Blood Plasma Pharmacokinetics. Fluorescent (Cy-5-labeled) DNA and DNA-L2
were injected into the tail vein of CD-1 mice (4–6-wk-old, Charles Rivers
Laboratories) at 1 mg/kg. Before injection, the mouse ear was placed on a
coverslip on the Nikon C1si+ confocal microscope system. An artery within
the ear was set in focus, and after injection, images of the artery were au-
tomatically collected every 2 s for 30 min. After 30 min, animals were killed.
Maximum initial fluorescence of the artery was set to a time of 0 s. Artery
fluorescence was evaluated by averaging pixel intensity values contained in
a circular region of interest located entirely within the vessel. Data were fit
to a one-phase exponential decay model (equation below) and half-life and
area under the curve were determined from these fits.
Fluorescenceblood = Fluor0 × e−kt.
Biodistribution in Tumor-Bearing Mice. For the orthotopic mouse tumor
model, athymic nude female mice (4–6-wk-old, Jackson Laboratory) were
injected in each mammary fat pad with 1 × 106 MDA-MB-231 cells in DMEM:
Matrigel (50:50). After 21 d, tumor-bearing mice were injected via the tail
vein with 1 mg/kg (nucleic acid dose) of fluorescent DNA, DNA-L2, or DNA
loaded in in vivo jetPEI. After 30 min, 24 h, and 48 h, animals were killed and
the organs of interest (heart, lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys, and tumors) were
excised. The fluorescence intensity in the organs was quantified on an IVIS
Lumina III imaging system at excitation wavelength of 620 ± 5 nm and
emission wavelength of 670 ± 5 nm (n = 3 animals, n = 6 tumors). Tumor
radiance data were fit to a one-phase exponential decay model (equation
below), and area under the curve was determined from these fits.
Radiancetumor = Radiance0 × e−kt.
For the PDX mouse tumor model (70), the triple-negative line HCI-010 was
transplanted into one inguinal mammary fat pad (surgically cleared of en-
dogenous epithelium) of nonobese diabetic/severe combined immune-de-
ficient (Jackson Laboratory) female mice of 3–4 wk of age (64). After ∼8 wk,
PDX tumors were harvested, cut into 4 mm × 2-mm pieces, serially trans-
planted into the cleared inguinal mammary fat pads of a new cohort of NOD-
SCID female mice, and grown to a volume of 300–500 mm3. Tumor-bearing mice
were injected via the tail vein with 1 mg/kg (nucleic acid dose) of fluorescent DNA-
L2 or DNA loaded in in vivo jetPEI. After 24 h, animals were killed, and the organs
of interest (heart, lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys, and tumors) were excised. The
fluorescence intensity in the organs was quantified on an IVIS Lumina III imaging
system at excitation wavelength of 620 ± 5 nm and emission wavelength of
670 ± 5 nm (n = 2 animals, n = 2 tumors).
Acute Toxicity in Liver and Kidney. CD-1 mice were injected with siRNA-L2
(10 mg/kg) or in vivo jetPEI-loaded siRNA (1, 2 mg/kg). After 24 h, blood was
collected by cardiac puncture and then centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 5 min. Then,
plasma was harvested and tested by the Vanderbilt Translational Pathology
Shared Resource for systemic levels of ALT, AST, BUN, and creatinine.
Tumor Distribution in Vivo After i.v. Injection. For the orthotopic tumor model,
athymic nude female mice (4–6-wk-old, Jackson Laboratory) were injected in
each mammary fat pad with 1 × 106 MDA-MB-231 cells in DMEM:Matrigel
(50:50). After 21 d, tumor-bearing mice were injected via the tail vein with
saline, 1 or 10 mg/kg fluorescent DNA-L2, or 1 mg/kg DNA-loaded in in vivo
jetPEI. Tumors were excised, and cells were isolated from each tumor. A mixture
of collagenase and DNase was used to dissociate cells, and ammonium-chloride-
potassium lysis buffer was used to remove red blood cells. Uptake of fluorescent
DNA or DNA-L2 was evaluated by flow cytometry (n = 4 animals, n = 8 tumors).
Tumor cells were identified as the cell population expressing GFP, whereas the
GFP-negative cell population corresponded to native mouse cells.
Target Gene Silencing After i.v. Injection. Athymic nude female mice (4–6-wk-
old, Jackson Laboratory) were injected in each mammary fat pad with 1 ×
106 MDA-MB-231 cells in DMEM:Matrigel (50:50). After tumors reached a
size of 50 mm2, tumor-bearing mice were injected i.p. with luciferin sub-
strate (150 mg/kg) and imaged for bioluminescence on an IVIS Lumina III
imaging system 30 min postinjection. Next, the mice were injected via the
tail vein with 10 mg/kg (based on siRNA dose) luc siRNA or siRNA-L2 or scr
siRNA-L2. Alternatively, mice were injected with 1 mg/kg in vivo jetPEI
complexed with luc or scr siRNA. Mice were imaged and treated at days
0 and 1 following treatment injection and imaged for bioluminescence over
time. Relative luminescence was determined by measuring the raw lumi-
nescent intensity of each tumor on each day and comparing to the initial
signal at day 0 (n = 10 tumors per group). Mouse body weight was evaluated
at each of these time points to investigate treatment toxicity.
Statistical Methods. The treatment groups were statistically compared using a
one-way ANOVA test (for nonrepeated measures of more than two groups) or
a two-way ANOVA (for measures repeated at multiple time points) coupled with
a Tukey means comparison test. For comparison between two groups, an in-
dependent two-tailed t test was used. A P value <0.05 was deemed represen-
tative of a significant difference between groups. For all data shown, the
arithmetic mean and SE are reported, and the sample size (n) is indicated.
Ethics Statement. The animal studies were conducted with adherence to the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (71). All experiments with
animals were approved by Vanderbilt University’s Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee.
