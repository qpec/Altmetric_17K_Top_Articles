ABSTRACT:
Background: a-Synuclein is a major
component of pathologic inclusions that characterize
Parkinson’s disease. PRX002 is an antibody that targets
a-synuclein, and its murine parent antibody 9E4 has
been shown in preclinical studies to reduce a-synuclein
pathology and to protect against cognitive and motor
deteriorations
and
progressive
neurodegeneration
in
human a-synuclein transgenic mice. Methods: This
first-in-human, randomized, double-blind, placebo-con-
trolled, phase 1 study assessed the impact of PRX002
administered to 40 healthy participants in 5 ascending-
dose cohorts (n 5 8/cohort) in which participants were
randomly assigned to receive a single intravenous infu-
sion of study drug (0.3, 1, 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg; n 5 6/
cohort)
or placebo
(n 5 2/cohort). Results: PRX002
demonstrated favorable safety, tolerability, and pharma-
cokinetic profiles at all doses tested, with no immuno-
genicity. No serious adverse events, discontinuations as
a result of adverse events, or dose-limiting toxicities
were reported. Serum PRX002 exposure was dose
proportional; the average terminal half-life across all
doses was 18.2 days. A significant dose-dependent
reduction in free serum a-synuclein (unbound to PRX002)
was apparent within 1 hour after PRX002 administration,
whereas total a-synuclein (free plus bound) increased
dose-dependently, presumably because of the expected
change in kinetics following antibody binding. Conclu-
sions: This study demonstrates that serum a-synuclein
can be safely modulated in a dose-dependent manner
after single intravenous infusions of an anti–a-synuclein
antibody. These findings support continued development
of PRX002, including further characterization of its safety,
tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic
effects in the central nervous system in patients with Par-
kinson’s disease. V

 Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder
that manifests a spectrum of motor, psychiatric, cogni-
tive, sleep, and autonomic signs and symptoms. The
key underlying motor manifestation is caused by a
slow
and
progressive
degeneration
of
dopamine-
producing neurons in the substantia nigra.1,2 Parkin-
son’s disease affects 7 to 10 million persons world-
wide,3
making
it
the
second
most
prevalent
neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer’s disease.4
Parkinson’s disease is also associated with significant
economic burden; in 2010, in the United States, medi-
cal
expenses
related
to
Parkinson’s
disease
were
approximately 2-fold higher than they were for an
age-matched population without Parkinson’s disease.5
Currently available treatments for Parkinson’s dis-
ease target the dopaminergic features of the disease
but do little to address its nondopaminergic symptoms
and fail to treat the underlying neurodegeneration and
progressive decline in neurologic function. In addition,
nonmotor symptoms of the disease (such as psychosis,
sleep behavior disorder, gastrointestinal dysfunction,
and cognitive impairment), which can be direct or
indirect outcomes of dopaminergic and other neuronal
loss, are often resistant to dopamine replacement strat-
egies and may be exacerbated by treatment under
some conditions.6,7 Furthermore, with prolonged use,
currently available treatments are often associated
with eventual disabling fluctuations, dyskinesias, and
dose-limiting side effects that decrease their benefits.8,9
There
is
a
significant
unmet
need
for
disease-
modifying
therapeutic
approaches
that
potentially
slow or halt the progression of Parkinson’s disease,
thereby reducing the substantial personal and econom-
ic burdens it creates.
The aggregation-prone a-synuclein protein is the
major component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites,
which are neuropathologic hallmarks of Parkinson’s
disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.10-12 Mis-
sense mutations in the a-synuclein gene and the over-
expression of the nonmutated protein because of gene
duplication or triplication are associated with early
onset Parkinson’s disease.13 Furthermore, strong corre-
lations between clinical manifestations in Parkinson’s
disease and the presence and severity of a-synuclein
pathology in the brain and peripheral nerves have
been reported.14 In preclinical studies, transgenic mice
that overexpress a-synuclein with missense mutations
demonstrate a number of key features of the dis-
ease.15-17
Although the etiology of Parkinson’s disease is yet to
be determined, substantial clinical and nonclinical data
suggest that soluble aggregated forms of a-synuclein
(eg, oligomers, soluble protofibrils) self-propagate and
may spread between interconnected nervous system
regions and contribute to disease progression. For
instance, the pattern of Lewy pathology in patients
with Parkinson’s disease is generally consistent with
disease propagation over interconnected neuronal net-
works14;

and

of
aggregated
a-synuclein accelerates the onset of neurologic symp-
toms and death in transgenic mice expressing human
a-synuclein.20 In addition to the established role of
Lewy bodies, soluble aggregated a-synuclein species
have also been proposed as a major neurotoxic form
of the protein in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s
disease.21 Altogether, these genetic, neuropathologic,
and nonclinical data support the therapeutic potential
of agents that target aggregated forms of a-synuclein
and block the cell-to-cell transmission of a-synuclein in
patients with Parkinson’s disease.
We have developed a monoclonal immunoglobulin
G1 antibody, PRX002, designed to preferentially target
soluble and insoluble aggregated forms of a-synuclein.
PRX002 is derived from the murine monoclonal anti-
body 9E4, which was developed based on results of
immunization experiments that showed that antibodies
directed
against
carboxyl
terminus
epitopes
of
a-synuclein were the most effective at reducing both
the neuronal accumulation of a-synuclein and the
behavioral deterioration in animal models.15,16 For
these reasons, PRX002 is being pursued therapeutically
in Parkinson’s disease for its potential to reduce the
underlying cause of the disease and its potential ability
to alter overall disease progression. Here we report the
results
of
a
first-in-human,
double-blind,
placebo-
controlled, single ascending-dose, phase 1 study of
PRX002 that evaluated the safety, tolerability, and
pharmacokinetics of PRX002 in healthy participants.
Secondary
and
exploratory
objectives
assessed
the
immunogenicity
and
pharmacodynamic
effects
of
PRX002 on serum a-synuclein.
Methods
Experimental Design
This was a single-center, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled,
single
ascending-dose,
phase
1
study
in
healthy
volunteers
(ClinicalTrials.gov,
NCT02095171). The study was performed at World-
wide Clinical Trials Early Phase Services, LLC, San
Antonio, Texas. Participants were enrolled into 1 of 5
dose-level cohorts in which they received PRX002
(0.3, 1, 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg) or placebo administered as
a 60-minute intravenous infusion. The study duration
was 16 weeks, comprising a 4-week screening period
and a 12-week follow-up period after administration
of a single dose of the study drug. The study protocol
was approved by the investigational review board for
the
study
site.
All
participants

 informed consent. The study was conducted according
to International Committee on Harmonisation Good
Clinical Practice guidelines and the principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki.
Participants
Key enrollment criteria included the following: 21
to 65 years of age; body weight > 45 to � 110 kg and
body mass index 18 to 32 kg/m2; good general health
with no clinically relevant abnormalities based on
medical history, physical examination, clinical labora-
tory evaluations, and 12-lead electrocardiography; sur-
gically sterile or using adequate contraception; not
taking medications (other than allowable oral and
implanted
contraceptives)
unless
approved
by
the
sponsor and the investigator; and no vaccination with-
in 30 days before baseline.
Randomization
Within each cohort, participants were randomly
assigned in 2 blocks. In the first block, 2 participants
received PRX002 or placebo 1:1 and served as sentinel
participants to assess safety and tolerability before the
second block was randomly assigned. In the second
block,
6
participants
were
randomly
assigned
to
receive PRX002 or placebo 5:1 at least 7 days after
the sentinel participants were dosed and their safety
data were reviewed.
Blinding
The study participants, investigators, sponsor, and
all staff members involved in the conduct of the study
were blinded to treatment assignment. The only per-
sonnel who had access to the randomization code
before database lock were the pharmacist and a bioa-
nalyst/pharmacokineticist not involved in the clinical
assessment of the participants. Randomization codes
were maintained in a secure location to which only
the nonblinded staff had access.
Procedures
All participants were screened within 4 weeks before
administration of the study drug. Eligible participants
were confined in the study unit from the day before
dosing
until
24
hours
after
dosing.
Participants
returned at intervals for outpatient visits until the final
assessment at week 12. Dose escalation for the second
cohort was based on the evaluation of 4 weeks of
safety data from the first cohort; for each subsequent
cohort, dose escalation was based on 2 weeks of safety
data from the preceding cohort.
PRX002 is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody.
The manufacturing process for PRX002 drug sub-
stance used a recombinant Chinese hamster ovary cell
line grown in a suspension culture. The manufacturing
campaign consisted of cell culture and harvest opera-
tions followed by a multiple-step purification and for-
mulation process. Manufactured PRX002 had the
expected structure and biological activity demonstrat-
ed by the results of an extensive and comprehensive
evaluation using an array of accepted analytical tech-
niques. All drug substances and drug products were
produced under good manufacturing practice condi-
tions. PRX002 was supplied by the sponsor in sterile
vials containing 200 mg lyophilized PRX002, which
was reconstituted with water for injection. Reconsti-
tuted PRX002 was mixed with normal saline to obtain
a total volume of 250 mL. The study drug was pre-
pared by a nonblinded study pharmacist for intrave-
nous infusion over 60 6 10 minutes. Normal saline
(250 mL) was used as the placebo.
All participants were asked to return 3 days, 7 days
(week 1), 14 days (week 2), 28 days (week 4), 42 days
(week 6), and 84 days (week 12) after dosing for clini-
cal, safety, and pharmacokinetic assessments. Immu-
nogenicity was assessed before dosing and at 2, 4,
and 12 weeks after dosing. Free and total serum
a-synuclein concentrations were assessed before dosing
and at 1 to 3 days and at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 12 weeks
after
dosing.
Serum
PRX002
concentrations
were
assessed at the following times: before dosing; 30
minutes after the start of the infusion; at the end of
the 60-minute infusion; 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours
after the end of the infusion; 1 and 3 days after dos-
ing; and 1, 2, 4, 6, and 12 weeks after dosing. Cere-
brospinal
fluid was not collected in this healthy
volunteer study.
Outcomes
The primary study objectives were to evaluate the
safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of a single
intravenous infusion of PRX002, and the secondary
objective was to assess immunogenicity. Safety was
assessed in all participants who received the study drug
(PRX002 or placebo); assessments included adverse
events (AEs), serious AEs, severity of AEs, laboratory
tests, vital signs, electrocardiography, and physical and
neurologic examinations and were reviewed before dose
escalation.
Pharmacokinetic
and
pharmacodynamic
sampling was performed on all participants. Serum
PRX002 was measured using a validated, quantitative
sandwich electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay (lower
limit of quantification 39.0 ng/mL) developed by Pro-
thena. Serum PRX002 pharmacokinetic parameters
were estimated using noncompartmental techniques
(Pheonix WinNonlin version 6.3; Pharsight Corpora-
tion, St. Louis, Missouri), including maximum concen-
tration, time to reach maximum concentration, area
under the serum concentration-time curve from time 0
hours to last quantifiable concentration calculated using
linear trapezoidal summation, area under the serum

 concentration-time curve from time 0 hours to infinity
(AUCinf), observed terminal rate constant, terminal
elimination half-life, total body clearance, and volume
of distribution.
Immunogenicity was assessed by measurement of
serum anti-PRX002 antibodies. A qualitative bridging
ECL assay was used to screen for anti-PRX002 anti-
bodies in human serum, with positive samples subject
to a confirmatory assay. Total serum a-synuclein and
free serum a-synuclein were measured using a quanti-
tative ECL assay using a commercially available kit
(Meso Scale Discovery, Rockville, Maryland). Samples
with
high
(>600 lg/mL)
hemoglobin
levels
were
excluded from a-synuclein measurements.
Statistical Analysis
Baseline
and demographic characteristics,
safety,
and pharmacokinetic data were summarized using
descriptive statistics. Total a-synuclein and free serum
a-synuclein concentrations and change from baseline
concentrations at each sampling time were summa-
rized at each dose level using descriptive statistics and
were assessed using a repeated-measures analysis per-
formed separately for free or total serum a-synuclein.
Two linear fixed-effects models, adjusted for baseline
as a covariate, were fit to results from 10 postbaseline
time points. Treatment, time, and their interaction,
estimated
using
a
restricted
maximum
likelihood
method, were included in the model. Given that the
treatment-by-time interaction was significant for both
parameters, the sequential trend test was performed at
each time point for both the free and total a-synuclein
levels. All tests, including main and interaction effects,
were conducted at the 2-sided significance level of .05.
When relevant, participants who received placebo
were pooled across cohorts. Participant disposition, dis-
continuation, and treatment-emergent AEs were sum-
marized using the frequencies and percentages of
participants (by treatment and dose where appropriate).
Results
Study Population
A total of 40 healthy volunteers were randomly
assigned to receive placebo or PRX002 from October
2014 to February 2015. Participants ranged in age from
21 to 58 years; the median age was 37.0 years (Table
1). Greater proportions of participants were women
(62.5%) and white (57.5%). Median body weight was
75.4 kg. No patients had a notable medical history, and
all were clinically well during the 4 weeks before the
study; baseline laboratory values were normal. There
were no significant protocol deviations.
Safety
Single intravenous infusions of PRX002 ranging
from 0.3 to 30 mg/kg were well tolerated, and no safe-
ty issues were identified; no deaths, serious AEs, or
dose-limiting toxicities were reported. All participants
completed
the
study,

 participant randomly assigned to 0.3 mg/kg PRX002
and lost to follow-up after the week 2 visit. Of the
participants,
18
reported
treatment-emergent
AEs
(Table 2), most of which were mild, and 6 AEs of
moderate severity were considered unrelated to the
study drug (2 were in placebo recipients). Only 1
severe
AE,
neutropenia,
was
reported
and
was
assessed by the investigator to be of viral etiology and
unrelated to the study drug (10 mg/kg PRX002). The
most common treatment-emergent AEs were head-
ache, nausea, vessel puncture site pain, viral infection,
and viral upper respiratory tract infection. Salivary
hypersecretion, a sense of heaviness in the left arm,
headache, nausea, fatigue, and abdominal pain were
the only AEs considered by the investigator to be
related to study treatment (defined as any AE with an
onset on or after the first dose of the study drug or
any pre-existing condition that worsened on or after
the first dose of the study drug); these were mild and
resolved by the end of the study. No clinically relevant
or treatment-relevant trends emerged from clinical lab-
oratory data, physical examination, vital signs, or
electrocardiography after dosing. No anti-PRX002
antibodies were detected.
Pharmacokinetics
Serum PRX002 exposure generally increased in par-
allel with PRX002 doses over the range of 0.3 to
30 mg/kg (Fig. 1; Table 3). Mean maximum concen-
trations ranged from 7.6 lg/mL (0.3 mg/kg PRX002)
to 578 lg/mL (30 mg/kg PRX002), and mean AUCinf
ranged
from
881 h�lg/mL
(0.3 mg/kg
PRX002)
to
85,920 h�lg/mL (30 mg/kg PRX002). Average terminal
half-life across all doses was 18.2 days. Total body
clearance was similar across doses, ranging from
0.2553 mL/h/kg (1 mg/kg PRX002) to 0.3492 mL/h/kg
(30 mg/kg PRX002). Volume of distribution values
ranged from 124.1 mL/kg (0.3 mg/kg) to 240.6 mL/kg
(10 mg/kg PRX002).

PRX002 unbound) serum a-synuclein were also statisti-
cally significant and were both dose and time depen-
dent
for
3-,
10-,
and
30-mg/kg PRX002 cohorts
beginning at 1 day after dosing. The highest median
percentage increases from baseline in total a-synuclein
were as follows: 3 mg/kg PRX002, 12,077 pg/mL
(100.5%) at 7 days; 10mg/kg PRX002, 20,446 pg/mL
(129.2%) at 3 days; and 30 mg/kg PRX002, 27,110 pg/
mL (196.9%) at week 2.
Discussion
In this first-in-human study, single intravenous doses
of PRX002 were safe and well tolerated and demon-
strated expected pharmacokinetic profiles at all dose
levels tested, up to and including 30 mg/kg. No deaths,
serious AEs, dose-limiting toxicities, or generation of
anti-PRX002
antibodies
resulted
from
treatment.
PRX002 significantly and substantially reduced free
serum a-synuclein levels within 1 hour after the end
of the infusion, the first time point assessed. These
reductions were persistent for 2 to 4 weeks after a sin-
gle infusion. These results demonstrate for the first
time that serum a-synuclein can be safely modulated

PRX002.
Current pharmacologic treatments for Parkinson’s
disease aim to attenuate the dopamine-related symp-
toms of the disease, acting primarily to increase dopa-
mine production or stability or directly stimulate
postsynaptic dopamine receptors. However, in the
long term, patients are served inadequately because of
treatment-related dyskinesia and the development or
persistence of nondopaminergic or nonmotor symp-
toms such as postural instability with related falls
or cognitive deficits.6,7,22,23 Given the central role of
a-synuclein in the neuropathology of Parkinson’s dis-
ease, a reduction in a-synuclein production or the
elimination
of
a-synuclein
aggregates
may
benefit
patients with this disease.24
The
predominant
intraneuronal
localization
of
a-synuclein
bound
to
presynaptic
terminal
mem-
branes25 has supported a normal function of the protein
in presynaptic vesicle supply and release and synaptic
plasticity in neurons. The functions, if any, of extracel-
lular a-synuclein, however, are not known. Although
various groups26-28 have described a-synuclein levels in
cerebrospinal fluid as reduced in patients with Parkin-
son’s disease, no consistent diagnostic or prognostic
connection
has
been
made
between
absolute
a-
synuclein levels and Parkinson’s disease symptoms and/
or stage in either cerebrospinal fluid or serum. Nonethe-
less, considering the presence of this protein in serum, it
is notable that substantial reductions in free serum a-
synuclein by PRX002 were without apparent adverse
physiological effect in the single-dose setting.
Given that the present study did not include cere-
brospinal fluid collections, it remains to be demon-
strated in future clinical studies whether PRX002
penetrates the central compartment, as is predicted by
preclinical studies. The ability of peripherally adminis-
tered antibodies to cross the blood–brain barrier to
act directly in the central nervous system has been
shown.29,30 Results from our previous studies in 2
transgenic mouse models of a-synucleinopathies dem-
onstrated that neuronal aggregation of a-synuclein
and associated loss of neuronal synapses, gliosis, and
motor and cognitive behavior deficits can be reduced
by treatment with the 9E4 antibody, suggesting that
the antibody does access the brain in mice.15,17 Fur-
thermore, in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, periph-
erally administered antibodies against b-amyloid were
shown to clear aggregated forms of that protein in the
brain and to reduce a downstream marker of neurode-
generation.28,31,32 In an ongoing multiple ascending-
dose, phase 1 study of PRX002 in patients with Par-
kinson’s disease, cerebrospinal fluid samples will be
collected to determine the level of peripherally admin-
istered PRX002 in the central compartment.
Although the results of this first-in-human study dem-
onstrated that PRX002 safely modulates a-synuclein in
the periphery, it is not possible at this time to conclude
whether soluble monomers or aggregates are preferen-
tially targeted in this measure. At a mechanistic level,
9E4 binds a-synuclein aggregates with substantially
higher affinity than a-synuclein monomers33 to block
cell-to-cell transmission of a-synuclein and to limit
cleavage of the protein by calpain,15 which generates
highly amyloidogenic peptide fragments of synuclein in
Lewy bodies.34 In addition, 9E4 demonstrated superior
efficacy compared with other antibodies that target a
number of other epitopes in a-synuclein. Improved effi-
cacy may result from the antibody’s high affinity for
aggregated a-synuclein and from interaction with an
epitope on cytotoxic aggregates that is required for their
uptake by neurons (eg, blocked binding to plasma mem-
brane) and/or posttranslational modifications (eg, pro-
tein truncations).15,16,35 Once the antibody is bound to
a-synuclein, the complex may be cleared from the
extracellular space by microglia, neuronal autophagy,
or bulk flow of interstitial fluid from the brain paren-
chyma, which would limit further oligomerization and
reduce seeding activity, cell-to-cell transmission, or
both.36,37 Although aggregated a-synuclein is thought
to be the relevant target of PRX002, multiple forms
may exist; hence, technical challenges limit assay devel-
opment and interpretation of aggregated a-synuclein in
animal and human tissue. Among several factors imped-
ing the establishment of a reliable assay are the pre-
sumed low abundance of a-synuclein aggregates in fluid
and the fact that their primary presence occurs within
the brain at sites not accessible to detection. Neverthe-
less, pharmacodynamic changes of the overall a-
synuclein pool caused by PRX002 can be assessed by
measuring changes in serum a-synuclein over time.
Ongoing and future clinical studies with PRX002
will aim to determine the safety and efficacy of multi-
ple doses of PRX002 in patients with Parkinson’s dis-
ease. Because the enrolled participants of the present
single-dose, healthy volunteer study were generally
younger (median age, 37 years; range, 21-58 years)
and a higher proportion of them were not white
(42.5%) compared with a more typical patient popu-
lation with Parkinson’s disease, safety and tolerability
will continue to be closely assessed in future studies.
Moreover, although no anti-PRX002 antibodies were
detected in this study, it remains important to contin-
ue to assess this end point in ongoing and future stud-
ies in which patients will receive multiple doses of the
study drug.
This phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers dem-
onstrates the safety of a single intravenous dose of
PRX002 and its ability to significantly reduce the lev-
els of free a-synuclein in serum. These results support
the design of the ongoing, multiple-ascending dose,
