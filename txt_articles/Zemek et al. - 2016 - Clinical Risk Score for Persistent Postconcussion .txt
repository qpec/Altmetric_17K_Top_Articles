IMPORTANCE Approximately one-third of children experiencing acute concussion experience
ongoing somatic, cognitive, and psychological or behavioral symptoms, referred to as
persistent postconcussion symptoms (PPCS). However, validated and pragmatic tools
enabling clinicians to identify patients at risk for PPCS do not exist.
OBJECTIVE To derive and validate a clinical risk score for PPCS among children presenting to
the emergency department.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective, multicenter cohort study (Predicting and
Preventing Postconcussive Problems in Pediatrics [5P]) enrolled young patients (aged 5-<18
years) who presented within 48 hours of an acute head injury at 1 of 9 pediatric emergency
departments within the Pediatric Emergency Research Canada (PERC) network from August
2013 through September 2014 (derivation cohort) and from October 2014 through June 2015
(validation cohort). Participants completed follow-up 28 days after the injury.
EXPOSURES All eligible patients had concussions consistent with the Zurich consensus
diagnostic criteria.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was PPCS risk score at 28 days,
which was defined as 3 or more new or worsening symptoms using the patient-reported
Postconcussion Symptom Inventory compared with recalled state of being prior to the injury.
RESULTS In total, 3063 patients (median age, 12.0 years [interquartile range, 9.2-14.6 years];
1205 [39.3%] girls) were enrolled (n = 2006 in the derivation cohort; n = 1057 in the
validation cohort) and 2584 of whom (n = 1701 [85%] in the derivation cohort; n = 883
[84%] in the validation cohort) completed follow-up at 28 days after the injury. Persistent
postconcussion symptoms were present in 801 patients (31.0%) (n = 510 [30.0%] in the
derivation cohort and n = 291 [33.0%] in the validation cohort). The 12-point PPCS risk score
model for the derivation cohort included the variables of female sex, age of 13 years or older,
physician-diagnosed migraine history, prior concussion with symptoms lasting longer than
1 week, headache, sensitivity to noise, fatigue, answering questions slowly, and 4 or more
errors on the Balance Error Scoring System tandem stance. The area under the curve was
0.71 (95% CI, 0.69-0.74) for the derivation cohort and 0.68 (95% CI, 0.65-0.72) for the
validation cohort.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A clinical risk score developed among children presenting to
the emergency department with concussion and head injury within the previous 48 hours
had modest discrimination to stratify PPCS risk at 28 days. Before this score is adopted in
clinical practice, further research is needed for external validation, assessment of accuracy in
an office setting, and determination of clinical utility.

C
oncussion is a serious public health epidemic.1,2 Rates
have doubled during the last decade3 with an esti-
mated 750 000 pediatric acute concussion visits to
emergency departments (EDs) occurring annually in the
United States.1,4 Although many children experience symp-
tom resolution within 2 weeks, approximately 33% experi-
ence ongoing somatic, cognitive, psychological, behavioral
symptoms, or a combination of these symptoms.5,6 Symp-
toms persisting beyond 28 days are referred to as persistent
postconcussion symptoms (PPCS)7 and can have serious
adverse effects, resulting in school absenteeism, impaired
academic performance, depressed mood, loss of social activi-
ties, and lower quality of life.8
Validated and pragmatic tools to identify children at high
risk of developing PPCS do not exist.9 Adolescent age, female
sex, and physician-diagnosed history of migraine have been
associated with PPCS in children5,10; however, prior studies
have had significant limitations. Retrospective studies are lim-
ited by poor data quality, missing data, minimal use of vali-
dated symptom scoring scales, and lack of standardized acute
evaluation.5,6,9-11
Additional limitations include small sample sizes,6,12 re-
cruitment beyond the acute injury period,13,14 and inconsis-
tent definition and measurement of PPCS.9 Studies including
elite adolescent athletes and adults dominate the literature,
limiting applicability to subsets of children. The Institute of
Medicine and the National Research Council emphasized the
needforalarge,prospectivestudytoquantifyPPCSriskinchil-
dren and youth and to establish “objective, sensitive, and spe-
cific metrics and markers of concussion diagnosis, prognosis,
and recovery in youth.”15
The Predicting and Preventing Postconcussive Problems
in Pediatrics (5P) study was designed to derive and validate a
clinicalriskscoretostratifyPPCSriskoccurringafteracutecon-
cussion in children and youth using readily available clinical
features.
Methods
Study Design
The 5P was a prospective, multicenter cohort study.16 Partici-
pants were recruited from 9 pediatric emergency depart-
ments within the Pediatric Emergency Research Canada
(PERC) network. Enrollment occurred from August 2013
through September 2014 (derivation cohort) and from Octo-
ber 2014 through June 2015 (validation cohort) (Figure 1).
The study complied with the transparent reporting of a mul-
tivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diag-
nosis (TRIPOD) statement17 and was approved by the ethics
committees of the PERC participating institutions. Written
consent and assent was obtained from all participants and
their parents or guardians as appropriate. The trial protocol
appears in Supplement 1.
Study Population
Eligible patients were aged 5 years through younger than 18
years, presented to a participating ED with a head injury within
the preceding 48 hours, and met concussion diagnostic crite-
ria consistent with the fourth Zurich consensus statement.18
Concussion was defined as a complex pathophysiological pro-
cess caused by a direct blow to the head, face, neck, or else-
where on the body with an impulsive force transmitted to the
head (which may or may not have involved loss of conscious-
ness), resulting in a brain injury with 1 or more symptoms in 1
or more of the following clinical domains: somatic, cognitive,
emotional or behavioral, or sleep (eTable 1 in Supplement 2).18
Patients were excluded for (1) a Glasgow Coma Scale score of
13 or less, (2) a structural abnormality on neuroimaging (if per-
formed), (3) a neurosurgical intervention, (4) intubation or in-
tensive care unit admission, (5) multisystem injury requiring
hospitalization, (6) procedural sedation, (7) severe preexist-
ing neurological developmental delay resulting in communi-
cation difficulties, (8) intoxication, (9) absence of trauma as
primary event, (10) previously enrolled in this same study,
(11) insurmountable language barrier, or (12) the inability to
follow-up by telephone or email.
Study Protocol
Procedures were identical for the derivation and validation
phases of the study. Prior to study initiation, participating site
ED physicians and research staff were trained on data collec-
tion methods using standardized training sessions during site
visits by the principal investigator and the national coordina-
tor. Trained research assistants completed standardized as-
sessments of all patients as described in the published
protocol.16 Data were collected and managed using research
electronic data capture.19
Patients and parents provided information on demograph-
ics, history, and injury characteristics using the Acute Con-
cussion Evaluation inventory.20 Patients and parents quanti-
fied state of being prior to the injury and current symptoms
using the Postconcussion Symptom Inventory (eFigure 1 in
Supplement 2).21,22 Cognition, physical examination, and bal-
ance were assessed using the third edition of the Child-Sport
ConcussionAssessmentTool.23Atenrollment,concussion;de-
velopmental, neurological, and psychiatric history; therapies
received during the ED visit; discharge instructions; and treat-
ing physician prognostication of PPCS risk with predicted
symptom duration were prospectively collected. Blinded, in-
dependent second raters in a convenience subset of 10% of pa-
tients duplicated data collection to assess reliability.24
Participants completed electronic follow-up surveys at
7, 14, and 28 days after the injury, including the patient-
reported Postconcussion Symptom Inventory16; electronic
capture was not expected to affect reporting.25 Patients opt-
ing for web-based follow-up received email reminders 24
hours following each survey deadline; research assistants
telephoned nonresponders and those opting for telephone
follow-up up to 5 times to complete measures orally.
Primary Outcome Measure
The primary outcome measure, PPCS, was defined in keeping
with the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and
Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) definition of
postconcussion syndrome, which requires persistence be-

yond 4 weeks of at least 3 symptoms compared with state of
being prior to the injury.26 In the study, an individual symp-
tom was defined as a positive difference between the patient-
reported current minus the perceived preinjury symptom rat-
ing; both were completed 28 days after the injury.26
Secondary Outcome Measure
Physician performance on prediction of PPCS was measured
and compared with PPCS risk score performance. A risk as-
sessment tool should outperform clinician accuracy to be
relevant.24 Treating physicians completed standardized sur-
veys, which included the following question: “How likely is
this patient to develop persistent symptoms beyond 1 month?”
(response options: 0%-10%, 11%-20%, 21%-30%, 31%-50%,
51%-70%, 71%-90%, and 91%-100%).
Statistical Analysis
Forty-six variables were selected a priori for assessment
based on a national planning meeting, recent systematic
reviews, previous studies, and clinical experience.16 Factors
occurring after the ED assessment (eg, compliance with rec-
ommendations regarding rest or exertion) were omitted
because this would reduce the face validity of a predictive
score. At a subsequent consensus meeting, the total parent-
reported Postconcussion Symptom Inventory score obtained
during the ED visit was separated into its 20 individual com-

ponents and each was analyzed as independent candidate
variable scores.
Based on the pilot study, it was estimated that 25% of
participants would experience PPCS when applying ICD-10
criteria.9 Including 10 events per each candidate predictor
variable,17 345 cases of PPCS would be required after screen-
ing for acceptable interrater agreement, assuming a dropout
rate of 25% for the a priori selected variables.27 To obtain 345
cases of PPCS, 1380 patients with new concussion had to be
enrolled. Factoring a loss to follow-up rate of 23% based on
pilot data,28 the final derivation cohort sample size required
was 1792 patients. To capture potential seasonal variability in
PPCS rates, a 1-year enrollment period was required.
BasedonasurveyofPERCmembers,2990%sensitivitywas
targeted to predict PPCS. To validate PPCS risk score with clini-
cally acceptable confidence bounds (95% CI, 85%-95%), 200
patients with PPCS were required in a separate validation co-
hort. Assuming a rate of PPCS of 25%, 800 patients with new
concussion had to be enrolled. With a loss to follow-up rate of
15% based on the derivation phase, the required validation
sample size was 920 patients.
Descriptivestatisticswereusedtosummarizebaselinechar-
acteristics. The differences between children with and with-
out PPCS were assessed using the χ2 test or the Fisher exact test
as appropriate. Emphasizing clinical relevance and face valid-
ity, predictors with continuous outcomes were categorized or
dichotomized. Interrater agreement was assessed for all can-
didate variables using the κ statistic; those variables with ac-
ceptable reliability (κ ≥0.6) remained eligible for the multivari-
ableanalysis.24Missingdatawerehandledvialist-wisedeletion.
All reliable variables associated with PPCS (P < .20) were
entered into a multivariable model using forward stepwise bi-
nary logistic regression analysis (P = .05 included but P = .10
removed). Variables in the regression model were assessed for
co-linearity using the variance inflation factor.
The risk score was evaluated as a diagnostic test calculat-
ing sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likeli-
hood ratios. The final model was validated internally using
bootstrap resampling.30 A risk score for the final multivari-
able model was derived using the model by Sullivan et al,31 in
which points were assigned to each predictor variable with
point totals corresponding to risk estimate. High- and low-
risk cut points for the PPCS risk score were determined by
consensus at a team meeting following the derivation phase.
Temporal validation was performed using a separate in-
dependentcohortinthesameinstitutionsfromwhichthederi-
vation data were collected (ie, no data from the validation co-
hort were used to derive the risk score, and no data from the
derivation cohort were used to validate). Validation perfor-
mance was evaluated with correlated receiver operating char-
acteristicanalysisandtestcharacteristics.Scorecalibrationwas
assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and graphically
using a calibration plot.32
Physicians’prediction was analyzed by logistic regres-
sion to predict PPCS. The accuracy of the validated risk strati-
fication score was compared with that of physicians’predic-
tions using the receiver operating characteristic analysis by
DeLong et al.33
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics
versions 21 and 23 (SPSS Inc) and R version 3.0.2 (R Founda-
tion for Statistical Computing). Two-sided P values of less than
.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
Patient Characteristics
There was complete assessment of the primary outcome of
PPCS for 1701 of 2006 participants (84.8%) in the derivation
cohort and 883 of 1057 participants (83.5%) in the validation
cohort (Figure 1). The median age for both cohorts was 12.0
years (interquartile range, 9.2-14.6 years). The baseline pa-
tient characteristics appear in Table 1. Details about the inju-
ries sustained and the types of medications used appear in
Table 2.
The characteristics of patients with missing primary out-
come data appear in eTable 2 in Supplement 2. The type of
treatments provided in the ED appear in eTable 3.
Derivation Cohort
Bivariable Analysis
There were 510 participants (30.0%) who met the criteria of
havingPPCSinthederivationcohort.Forty-sevenpotentialpre-
dictor variables were associated with PPCS in the bivariable
analysis(Table3,Table4,andeTable4inSupplement2).There
were 294 patients (15%) who had blinded duplicate assess-
ments (research assistant only: n = 145 [7%]; physician only:
n = 92[5%];bothresearchassistantandphysician:n = 57[3%]).
Excellent overall interrater agreement was demonstrated
(median κ = 0.97 [κ interquartile range, 0.75-0.99]).
Multivariable Analysis
The final multivariable model included (1) age, (2) sex,
(3) prior concussion with symptom duration of longer than 1
week, (4) physician-diagnosed migraine history, (5) head-
ache, (6) sensitivity to noise, (7) fatigue, (8) answering ques-
tions slowly, and (9) abnormal tandem stance (Table 5). The
area under the curve (AUC) was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.69 to 0.74;
eFigure 2 in Supplement 2). All variables had a variance
inflation factor of less than 2.5, indicating a lack of multicol-
linearity between predictors.
Bootstrapping analysis (ie, resampling the model 1000
times) revealed a mean overoptimism value of 0.01 (95% CI,
–0.02 to 0.03) and a corrected AUC of 0.70. In the final
derivation model, 94.3% (1604/1701) of the participants with
primary outcome data had complete data on all 9 predictor
variables included in the multivariable model. The PPCS risk
score derived from the multivariable model (score range, 0 to
12) linearly corresponded to risk estimate. Three cutoff points
were selected to stratify PPCS risk (low risk: ≤3 points;
medium risk: 4-8 points; and high risk: ≥9 points; Table 6).
Validation Cohort
There were 291 patients (33.0%) who met the criteria of
having PPCS. The AUC for the model was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.65-
0.72).Forpatientsnotatlowrisk(≤3points),thesensitivitywas

Even though prior research found an association be-
tween prolonged recovery and total postinjury symptom bur-
den score (22 items using a 7-point scale),34 such a complex
scale is a barrier to adoption by acute care clinicians.24 We in-
stead analyzed individual symptoms, resulting in a final model
thatincludes4earlysymptomsandsignsinthePPCSriskscore.
Several final model variables have been associated with PPCS,
including headache, answering questions slowly, and sensi-
tivity to noise.9,11,35 Female sex and older age are associated
with prolonged recovery in children and adults.9,35

memory (maximum: 15 points), concentration (maximum: 6 points), and recall
(maximum: 5 points). The total points (maximum: 30 points) were calculated.
A higher score indicates better cognitive function. Because performance is
correlated with age, the total score in the analysis was standardized
(mean [SD], 0 [1]) for age using norms.
dAssesses static postural stability. In tandem stance, the participant is
instructed to stand heel to toe with the nondominant foot in the back and to
hold this stance for 20 seconds with hands on hips and eyes closed. The
modified version of this test is calculated by adding 1 error point for each error
during the 20-second test; total scores range from 0 to 10. A higher score
indicates poorer postural stability.
e A neurological scale that measures state of consciousness. Scores are assigned
for eye opening (4 points), verbal response (5 points), and motor (6 points);
total scores range from 3 to 15. A higher score indicates greater alertness.

Therefore, future research needs to determine if the moder-
ate test characteristics of the PPCS risk score allow for clini-
cians to confidently provide reassurance, alter management
plans, or both. Future clinical benefits might include identi-
fying high-risk individuals for further screening, prioritiza-
tion for specialized concussion evaluations, and initiation of
emerging treatments to prevent PPCS.36

Strengths of this study include standardized assessment
of predictor and outcome variables using validated scales in a
cohort with acute concussions (exclusion of presentations >48
hours after injury). Moreover, a large, cross-country, multi-
site validation cohort confirmed good predictive perfor-
mance of the risk score model used in the derivation cohort.
Inclusion of participants from a wide age range and spectrum
of injuries and those with behavioral, learning, and psycho-
logical problems enhances generalizability.
There were minor baseline differences between the deri-
vation and validation cohorts (eg, age group, learning disabili-
ties, depression, and type of sports played). These differ-
ences increase the generalizability of our model. Therefore, we
believe our findings are applicable to the assessment of chil-
dren seeking acute care following a concussive event.
Despite collective agreement across guidelines that initial
management should include physical and cognitive rest fol-
lowed by graduated return to normal activities, wide practice
variation exists.29,37 The lack of evidence for initial manage-
ment of concussion (including protocols regarding timing of
returning to activity) is a crucial issue in the field of pediatric
concussion, and results of this study should be applied in
urgently needed future comparative clinical trials.38 The
PPCS risk score will benefit concussion care research by pro-
viding a tool for the targeted selection of patients in greatest
need of intervention.9 Selection of pediatric patients at high
risk for PPCS may optimize research recruitment by offering
more efficient and cost-effective enrollment strategies, or
may be used to stratify participants in clinical trials according
to PPCS risk.
Because no objective criterion standards for concussion
or PPCS diagnoses exist (ie, no readily available biomarkers or
imaging modalities),39 the PPCS risk prediction score may be
less precise than prediction studies for other diseases. None-
theless, the outcome measures used in this study generated
the best-available evidence through the use of validated tools.
In addition, the definitions we used aligned with current con-
cussion guidelines and ICD-10 standards.18,26,40 The PPCS risk
model demonstrated only modest ability to discriminate pa-
tients who will and will not have PPCS, resulting in erroneous
categorization. Test characteristics could be further refined
through inclusion of biomarkers, genetic data, or advanced
neuroimaging techniques. The pragmatic, generalizable PPCS
risk model does not require expensive and painful testing, and
could therefore be used to triage initial management.
There are several limitations to this study. Selection bias
may limit generalizability. The patients with concussion in our
derivation and validation cohorts may have higher PPCS rates
and different risk characteristics than those patients with less
severe injuries who may have not sought pediatric ED care.
Nonetheless, the study included a heterogeneous population
recruited through the use of a large number of study sites with
great geographical variation.
Even with inclusion of concussions sustained by a vari-
ety of mechanisms, some of which may have involved higher
forces than those generally seen in sports (eg, motor vehicle
collisions), we observed similar rates of PPCS and loss of con-
sciousness as the rates in the sideline assessment and outpa-
tient literature.41-43 Because it is possible that the PPCS risk
score may not perform as well in different populations, vali-
dation should occur in other clinical settings, such as non–
tertiary care EDs, primary care, and sideline assessments.
In addition, the sample was limited to participants with-
outobservablelesionsonimaging;therefore,itmaynotberep-
resentative of a more complicated spectrum of mild trau-
matic brain injury. However, because the presence of an
intracranial lesion on standard imaging no longer meets the
current concussion definition,18,40 outcome prediction in this
populationisbeyondthestudy’
sscope.Futureresearchshould
seek to determine the performance of this PPCS risk assess-
ment tool in a nuanced population of patients with mild trau-
matic brain injury.
Although other injuries might have contributed to ongo-
ing symptoms, patients with multisystem injuries requiring
hospitalization were excluded. An additional limitation is that
measures of socioeconomic status or family functioning were

follow-up care and resources thus affecting symptom burden
with alteration of PPCS risk.
Even though the study had missing data, it was limited in
scope.Baselinecharacteristicsweresimilarbetweenthosewith
and without the primary outcome in both the derivation and
validationcohorts,andmostenrolledparticipantshadnomiss-
ing data.
Given the wide age range, potential variation exists in re-
spondent type (parent vs patient); however the Postconcus-
sion Symptom Inventory has good parent and self-report
correlation.22 In addition, without a control group, we can-
not definitively attribute ongoing symptoms to the acute in-
jury. However, literature examining PPCS incidence in pa-
tients with head injury compared with controls (eg, orthopedic
injury) has yielded similar rates in the head injury group as in
our cohort.9
Conclusions
A clinical risk score developed among children presenting to
the ED with concussion and head injury within the previous
48 hours had modest discrimination to stratify PPCS risk at
28 days. Before this score is adopted in clinical practice, fur-
ther research is needed for external validation, assessment of
accuracy in an office setting, and determination of clinical
utility.
