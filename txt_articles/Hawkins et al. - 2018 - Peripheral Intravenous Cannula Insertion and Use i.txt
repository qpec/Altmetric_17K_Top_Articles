ABSTRACT
Objectives: The objective was to examine cannulation practice and effectiveness of a multimodal intervention to
reduce peripheral intravenous cannula (PIVC) insertion in emergency department (ED) patients.
Methods: A prospective before and after study and cost analysis was conducted at a single tertiary ED in
Australia. Data were collected 24 hours a day for 2 weeks pre- and post implementation of a multimodal
intervention. PIVC placement and utilization within 24 hours were evaluated in all eligible patients.
Results: A total of 4,173 participants were included in the analysis. PIVCs were placed in 42.1% of patients’ pre
intervention and 32.4% post intervention, a reduction of 9.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 6.8 to –12.72%).
PIVC usage within 24 hours of admission was 70.5% pre intervention and 83.4% post intervention, an increase of
12.9% (95% CI = 8.8% to 17.0%). Sixty-six patients were observed in the ED for cost analysis. The mean time
per PIVC insertion was 15.3 (95% CI = 12.6 to 17.9) minutes. PIVC insertion cost, including staff time and
consumables per participant, was A$22.79 (95% CI = A$19.35 to A$26.23).
Conclusions: The intervention reduced PIVC placement in the ED and increased the percentage of PIVCs
placed that were used. This program benefits patients and health services alike, with potential for large cost
savings.
P
eripheral intravenous cannulation is one of the
most commonly performed invasive procedures in
the
emergency
department
(ED).1
Peripheral
intravenous cannulas (PIVCs) are intended for the
delivery of fluid, medication, blood, or contrast during
the patient’s hospital stay. Previous studies report that

 while many patients presenting to ED receive a
PIVC,2 half the PIVCs inserted in the ED are not
used3–7 or are used only for a secondary purpose such
as for collection of pathology samples.8 Potential rea-
sons for unused PIVCs include insertion being part of
the “cultural” norm and PIVCs placed “just-in-case”
rather than for a specific clinical indication.
Reducing the number of unnecessary PIVCs is
important; insertion can be painful for patients, con-
sumes staff time, costs money, and poses a risk of seri-
ous infection.9–12 The most serious complication of
PIVC placement is infection with Staphylococcus aureus
bacteremia (SAB). PIVC-related SAB represents as
much as 25% of all health care–associated SAB
episodes.11,13
Quality improvement projects to reduce unnecessary
placement of PIVCs in the wards have reduced inser-
tions by 13% to 40%.14,15 In the prehospital setting,
an
education
intervention
also
reported
improve-
ments.16 Promising results have been identified in a
recent small study in the ED, which demonstrated the
potential for a multimodal education program to
improve appropriate PIVC insertion and utilization in
this setting.2
No accepted guidelines currently exist that identify
when PIVCs are required in an emergency setting.17
Researchers from Monash University suggest that the
most practical guide for PIVC insertion should be
when a clinician believes it is 80% likely to be used.17
The aim of our study was to compare PIVC place-
ment and usage in an emergency setting before and
after an educational intervention designed to improve
appropriate use of PIVCs. Our hypothesis was that an
education program designed to prompt clinical staff to
be 80% sure PIVC will be used prior to insertion
would decrease insertion and increase percentage of
placed PIVC that are used.
METHODS
Study Design
This was a before-and-after study assessing PIVC inser-
tion and usage before and after a multimodal interven-
tion. Prior to study commencement ethical approval
was granted by the local Hospital Human Research
Ethics Committee.
Study Setting and Population
The study was conducted between February and June
2016 in a metropolitan tertiary ED in Australia, with
an annual presentation rate of 75,000 cases. Patients
were eligible if they presented to the ED and were
aged ≥ 18 years. Patients were excluded if they were
triage category 1, had a PIVC inserted by ambulance
services, or were transferred from another hospital.
Study Protocol
Data were collected over a 12-day period prior to the
intervention and a 12.5-day period post intervention.
Post intervention data were collected 1 month after
the intervention concluded to allow for transition and
implementation of the educational message. Research
staff collected data prospectively 24 hours per day for
both periods, with all eligible patients observed for
24 hours or until discharged. Standardized case report
forms were used for data including demographics, can-
nula insertion and utilization, patient disposition, and
diagnostic category. If cannula use was not evident
during the ED phase of patient care, the electronic
medical record was interrogated. A used PIVC was
defined as one with evidence of intravenous drug, con-
trast, fluid, or blood product administration. An
unused PIVC was defined as a cannula that was
inserted and not used either prior to discharge or
within 24 hours of presentation to the ED.
An additional random sample of patients was
observed during PIVC insertion for cost analysis
between the pre- and post intervention periods. For
each PIVC insertion, the time taken, number of
attempts, equipment used, and the staff classification
were recorded. Staff time was calculated at 1-minute
intervals. Staff time was valued at the fixed industrial
award wages in Queensland, Australia, at the time of
the study (June 2016), using the middle pay grade for
the staff involved. The equipment used was valued
using negotiated hospital supply contract rates (2016)
from the perspective of Queensland Health, Australia.
The average cost per PIVC insertion comprised the
average cost of equipment and staff time.
Intervention
The 10-week intervention, termed CREDIT (Cannula-
tion Rates in Emergency Department Intervention
Trial) commenced in March 2016. The post interven-
tion data collection phase occurred 4 weeks after the
intervention. The multimodal intervention included:
1) education and training, 2) change champions and
advertising, and 3) surveillance and feedback. The
intervention targeted all medical and nursing staff
within the ED.
ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE • January 2018, Vol. 25, No. 1 • www.aemj.org
27
 The education component comprised clinical nurse
and ED consultant physician–led training to educate
staff on PIVC risks, placement, and care. The key
message prompted clinicians to think critically and
empowered them to place a PIVC only if they believed
it was 80% likely the hemodynamically stable patient
would require a PIVC within the next 24 hours for
medications, fluids, contrast, or blood product admin-
istration. The “80% sure” criteria was adopted from
research conducted at Monash University Hospital,
described as a simple and effective trigger to prompt
clinical decision making regarding the need for PIVC
placement in the ED.17,18 Clinicians were asked to
consider the risk of PIVC and whether risk of PIVC
placement
outweighed
the
benefit.
The
use
of
venepuncture for phlebotomy as a procedure separate
to cannula insertion was encouraged as this is policy
within the institution. During the intervention mini-
mal emphasis was placed on taking a moment to con-
sider if the patient would benefit from oral analgesia/
fluids or antiemetics. No suggested alternatives were
given. The intervention did not attempt to change the
therapies applied currently in the ED. The focus was
on the idle cannula or the cannula only used for
pathology collection.
Posters with the 80% logo and “PIVC are you
sure?” were displayed in all clinical areas in the ED.
Champions were recruited to disseminate the message
over all shifts and disciplines. They were identified
from a group of existing medical and nursing staff of
varying seniority that assisted with the delivery of edu-
cation in scheduled training time. While working clini-
cal shifts the champions wore shirts bearing the
CREDIT insignia and the question “are you 80%
sure?” (Figure 1). The shirt enabled staff to promote
the 80% message in the clinical area and aided in
maintaining the momentum of the intervention.
Data Analysis
This study aimed to estimate PIVC insertion and use
with high precision and detect a reduction in rates of
placed and unused cannulas. Based on local audit
findings we estimated that 65% of our ED patients
have a cannula placed. Prior research has shown that
50% of PIVC are unused.3 To obtain precision of 3%
and confidence level of 95%, we required 972 patients
in each of the pre- and post intervention periods to
estimate the proportion inserted and 1,068 patients in
each of the pre- and post intervention periods with
cannula placed to estimate the proportion unused
(1,644 patients overall in each time period if 65%
have a PIVC placed). To detect a reduction in rates of
placed PIVC by 15%, a sample size of 480 cannulated
patients (240 patients pre- and 240 patients post inter-
vention) would achieve power of 90% at a significance
level of 0.05. We sought to obtain a sample size of
3,288 (1,644 in each period) to achieve adequate
power for all aims of this study.
Data were analyzed using Stata version 14 (Stata-
Corp). Baseline characteristics of the cohort were
reported by participant group (pre- or post interven-
tion). The proportion of patients with PIVC inserted
and the proportion of patients with unused PIVC
were calculated for each participant group. In both
instances, the difference between the group propor-
tions and the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the dif-
ference was reported. As patients could have multiple
admissions during the study period, the 95% CI of
the difference
was adjusted for nonindependence
using clustered robust standard errors. PIVC insertion
status was unknown for five patients, with an addi-
tional two patients having unknown usage. Such
patients were removed from the analyses examining
insertion rates and usage, respectively.
An interrupted time-series analysis (or segmented
regression analyses) was employed to identify whether
there was a quantitative change in PIVC insertion
after
the
implementation
of
the
intervention,
or
whether there was a gradual change in rates across the
data collection period, potentially due to a Hawthorne

of
the
Hawthorne effect; the analysis revealed that there was
a decrease in PIVC insertion seen only in post inter-
vention data. The results of this analysis are not pre-
sented in this paper; however, they are available upon
request.
Cost Analysis
The economic evaluation was a within-trial cost analy-
sis using Queensland Health costs. The number of
ED presentations in the post intervention period was
multiplied by the difference in PIVC insertion rates
pre- and post intervention. This provided an estimate
of the number of PIVCs avoided. This was multiplied
by the average cost per PIVC. In estimating the 95%
CIs, the number of avoided PIVCs and the cost per
PIVC were assumed to be independent.
Missing data were assumed to be missing at ran-
dom and excluded from the cost analysis. One thou-
sand bootstrapped samples were used to estimate
uncertainty in the cost and staff time estimates. All
costs are presented in Australian dollars.
RESULTS
There were 5,347 presentations to the ED during the
data collection period. A total of 1,174 were excluded
(Figure 2) leaving data for 4,173 presentations. There
were 746 patients who had multiple presentations dur-
ing the study period. Baseline characteristics of the
pre-
and
post
intervention
samples
were
similar
(Table 1).
Peripheral intravenous cannulas were inserted in
869 (42.1%) of the pre intervention cohort and 682
(32.4%) of the post intervention cohort, a difference
of –9.8% (95% CI = –12.7 to –6.8%). A total of
585/868 (67.4%) of pre intervention and 541/681
(79.4%) of post intervention PIVCs were used within
the ED, equating to a difference of 12.0% (95% CI =
8.7% to 17.0%). PIVCs were used within 24 hours of
admission (either ED or inpatient ward) for 612
(70.4%) and 568 (83.4%) of patients in the pre- and
postintervention groups respectively (Table 2) , a dif-
ference of 12.86% (95% CI = 8.7% to 17.0%).
We recorded health care resource utilization data
for 66 patients. Overall, 58 patients had a PIVC
inserted successfully. Eight patients were excluded, one
refused after four attempts, two were deemed not to
require a PIVC (after one and three attempts, respec-
tively), and five patients had missing time data. Thirty-
one percent of patients needed more than one attempt
to be successful. The average time per PIVC insertion
was 15.3 minutes (95% CI = 12.6 to 17.9 minutes).
In the 69% of patients with a successful first attempt,
the average time was 10.9 minutes (95% CI = 9.8 to
12.0 minutes). The average equipment cost was A
$6.53 (95% CI = $5.98 to $7.07) per patient. The
average cost of staff time was A$16.26 (95% CI =
$13.10 to $19.42) per patient. Total average cost was
A$22.79 (95% CI= $19.35 to $26.23) per patient
(Data Supplement S1, available as supporting informa-
tion in the online version of this paper, which is avail-
able at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ace
m.13335/full). The costs associated with the education
program were minimal as it was delivered in regular
training time and reinforced in the clinical area with
opportunistic short sessions. Shirt and poster printing
and supply costs were A$527.
Based on the observed reduction in PIVC insertion
rates of 9.8% (95% CI = 6.8% to 12.7%), this would
equate to 207 (95% CI = 143 to 268) PIVC inser-
tions avoided in the post intervention period. At the
average
cost of A$22.79
(95%
CI = $19.35 to
$26.23) this would result in a saving of A$4,718
(95% CI = $3,126 to $6,309) over the 2-week post
intervention trial period (Table 3).
DISCUSSION
The
multimodal
intervention
empowered
staff
to
appraise critically the requirement for PIVC placement
and resulted in significant reduction in PIVC inser-
tion, with a corresponding increase in PIVC usage.
The campaign is a simple cost-saving intervention that
can be conducted using minimal additional resources
outside of existing department education.
We found that PIVC placement was reduced by
9.8% after the intervention. This finding is consistent
with prior research in a ward and prehospital set-
ting.14–16 One previous ED study utilized data from
300 patients to examine the effect of system changes
including stickers for documentation of PIVC inser-
tion and removal stickers, new venepuncture devices,
changing the intravenous trolley layout, and an educa-
tional campaign.2 Similar to our research, this study
found a reduction in PIVC placement following the
intervention. However, these investigators did not find
a corresponding increase in PIVC usage post interven-
tion. Several potential explanations exist for the find-
ings. A small sample size, unstable estimates, and low

 power may have precluded the detection of an effect.
The intervention differed in its focus on environment
change rather than an education and cultural change

critical
thinking

change.
In our study we identified between 42% (pre) and
32% (post) of patients had a PIVC inserted and of

 these 70% (pre) and 83% (post) were used. These fig-
ures differ from the only other ED study that reported
PIVC insertion in 16% of the cohort and a usage rate
of 50%.3 Given this study’s retrospective chart review
design with reliance on documentation of cannula
insertion, these results must be interpreted with cau-
tion. Examination of a chart for evidence of insertion
is likely to identify PIVC that have been accessed for
therapy. Evidence of PIVC insertion may be difficult
to identify as documentation is poor. Results identified
in prospective studies outside the ED setting are more
in keeping with our findings. A study of 1,000 general
medical patients identified that 67% of PIVC were
used.19 Another study in an acute medical admission
unit found that 80% of patients received a PIVC and
of these 66% were used.20
LIMITATIONS
We acknowledge that our study has limitations. Influ-
ences such as rotations of new staff may have con-
tributed to changes in PIVC use. We did not collect
data on the number of patients who had a PIVC
subsequently inserted as an inpatient, making it
unclear
whether PIVC
insertion
was avoided
or
merely delayed for some patients. Given that only
20% of patients without a PIVC were admitted,
insertion in the ward is likely to be a rare event. Fur-
ther, while there is a risk that patients without a
PIVC may have a decline in their clinical status,
emergency clinicians can identify this change and are
trained to insert a PIVC in emergency circumstances.
Evidence suggests that placing cannulas “just in case”
potentially exposes patients to infection and this is
more harmful than their risk of deterioration without
a cannula.
The cost of separate venesection was not included in the
analysis. We did not tailor our intervention to optimize use
of oral therapies nor did we attempt to reduce avoidable
intravenous therapies. While cost of venesection and use of
alternative therapies are important to consider, they were
outside the scope of this study. Future studies that examine
1) use of oral therapies and 2) reducing unnecessary intra-
venous tests and therapies are needed.
CONCLUSIONS
Peripheral
intravenous
cannula
insertion
can
be
reduced using a multimodal approach designed to sup-
port critical thinking and promote clinically appropri-
ate peripheral intravenous cannula insertion and use.
