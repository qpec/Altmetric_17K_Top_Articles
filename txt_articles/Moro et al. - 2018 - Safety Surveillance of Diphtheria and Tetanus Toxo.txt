OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety of currently licensed diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis 
(DTaP) vaccines in the United States by using data from the Vaccine Adverse Event 
Reporting System (VAERS), a spontaneous reporting surveillance system.
METHODS: We searched VAERS for US reports of DTaP vaccinations occurring from January 1, 
1991, through December 31, 2016, and received by March 17, 2017. We reviewed available 
medical records for all death reports and a random sample of reports classified as nondeath 
serious. We used Empirical Bayesian data mining to identify adverse events that were 
disproportionally reported after DTaP vaccination.
RESULTS: VAERS received 50 157 reports after DTaP vaccination; 43 984 (87.7%) of them 
reported concomitant administration of other vaccines, and 5627 (11.2%) were serious. 
Median age at vaccination was 19 months (interquartile range 35 months). The most 
frequently reported events were injection site erythema (12 695; 25.3%), pyrexia (9913; 
19.8%), injection site swelling (7542; 15.0%), erythema (5599; 11.2%), and injection 
site warmth (4793; 9.6%). For 3 of the DTaP vaccines, we identified elevated values for 
vaccination errors using Empirical Bayesian data mining.
CONCLUSIONS: No new or unexpected adverse events were detected. The observed 
disproportionate reporting for some nonserious vaccination errors calls for better 
education of vaccine providers on the specific indications for each of the DTaP vaccines.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Prelicensure 
studies revealed that the most common adverse 
reactions to 6 US licensed diphtheria-tetanus-
acellular pertussis vaccines (Infanrix, Daptacel, 
Pediarix, Pentacel, Kinrix, and Quadracel) were 
injection site and systemic reactions.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Postlicensure surveillance 
of adverse events after the 5 licensed diphtheria-
tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccines over a 19-year-
period did not find any new or unexpected safety 
concerns in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting 
System.

 Whole cell pertussis–containing 
(DTwP) vaccine was developed 
in the 1930s and used widely in 
clinical practice by the mid-1940s.1 
DTwP vaccine was 70% to 90% 
effective in preventing serious 
pertussis disease.1 Concerns about 
safety (particularly severe local 
reactions, febrile seizures, and 
reports of acute encephalopathy 
after vaccination) led to the 
development and licensure of 
diphtheria-tetanus-acellular 
pertussis (DTaP) vaccines.2 
–4 The 
first DTaP vaccine was approved  
by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) for use in 
the United States in 1991 and 
recommended in place of DTwP 
for the fourth and fifth doses of 
the recommended series among 
children ≥15 months of age.4 In 
1997, the Advisory Committee 
on Immunization Practices 
recommended DTaP for all 5 
doses in the childhood vaccination 
schedule. DTaP is reported to have 
mild local and systemic adverse 
reactions and less frequent serious 
adverse events (AEs) compared 
with DTwP.4 DTwP is no longer 
licensed nor is it available for use in 
the United States.4
Currently, there are 2 DTaP 
vaccines licensed in the United 
States for the entire 5-dose 
series: Infanrix (GlaxoSmithKline 
Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium) 
and Daptacel (Sanofi Pasteur, 
Ltd, Swiftwater, PA), which were 
approved in 1997 and 2002, 
respectively.5, 
 
6 In addition, 
the following 4 combination 
DTaP-containing vaccines have 
been licensed: (1) Pediarix 
(GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals), a 
combination of DTaP, hepatitis 
B vaccine, and inactivated 
polio vaccine (IPV) approved in 
December 20027 and approved  
for use as a 3-dose series; (2) 
Pentacel (Sanofi Pasteur, Ltd), 
a combination of a DTaP-IPV 
component and Haemophilus 
influenzae type b (Hib)  
conjugate vaccine, licensed in  
June 20088 as a 4-dose series; 
(3) Kinrix (GlaxoSmithKline 
Biologicals); and (4) Quadracel 
(Sanofi Pasteur, Ltd), each a 
combination of DTaP and IPV, 
licensed in June 20089 and in  
March 2015, 
10 respectively, as 
a fifth dose in the 5-dose series. 
Prelicensure studies of these 
vaccines revealed that the most 
common AEs after vaccination 
were injection site and systemic 
reactions.5 
– 
10
Postmarketing observational studies 
have shown that the DTaP-containing 
vaccines have a good safety 
record.11 
– 
22 In 2 studies of DTwP 
and DTaP vaccines conducted in the 
Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting 
System (VAERS) in the early 1990s, 
no major safety concerns were 
identified. AEs and hospitalizations 
were less common with DTaP than 
with DTwP.23, 
 
24 However, these 
initial VAERS studies covered short 
periods of time and did not include 
the DTaP vaccines currently available 
in the United States; therefore, the 
safety information provided in 
these analyses are limited.23, 
 
24 In 
the current study, we used VAERS 
to assess the safety of currently 
available DTaP vaccines in the  
United States.
METHODS
VAERS
VAERS is a US national  
vaccine safety surveillance  
system created in 1990 and 
coadministered by the Centers  
for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) and the FDA. It receives 
spontaneous reports of AEs after 
vaccination. Vaccination errors 
not describing an AE may also be 
reported.25 With VAERS, whether 
an AE is causally associated with 
vaccination generally cannot be 
assessed, but it may be useful for 
detecting potential vaccine  
safety signals.25 VAERS 
accepts reports from vaccine 
manufacturers, health care 
providers, vaccine recipients,  
and others. The VAERS report  
form collects information on  
age, sex, vaccines administered, 
dose and lot number, the AE 
experienced, and health history.  
Signs and symptoms of AEs are 
coded by trained personnel by 
using the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), a  
clinically validated, internationally  
standardized terminology.26 A 
VAERS report may be assigned 1 
or more MedDRA preferred terms 
(PTs). A PT is a distinct descriptor 
for a symptom, sign, disease, 
diagnosis, therapeutic indication, 
investigation, surgical, or medical 
procedure, or medical, social,  
or family history characteristic, 
26  
but PTs are not necessarily 
medically confirmed diagnoses. 
System Organ Class is the highest 
level of the MedDRA hierarchy that 
provides the broadest classification 
for AEs (eg, nervous system 
disorders).27 Reports are classified 
as serious or nonserious. A report 
is considered serious on the basis 
of the Code of Federal Regulations 
(21) definition if 1 or more of the 
following are reported: death, life-
threatening illness, hospitalization 
or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization, or permanent 
disability.28 For serious reports, 
medical records are routinely 
requested and made available to 
VAERS personnel.
We searched the VAERS database 
for reports after DTaP vaccination 
received by March 17, 2017, for 
persons given any of the currently 
licensed DTaP vaccines from January 
1, 1991, through December 31, 2016. 
Non-US reports and duplicate reports 
were excluded. We summarized the 
most common MedDRA terms for 
serious and nonserious DTaP vaccine 
reports. Quadracel was not included

 in our search because few reports 
had been received by VAERS at the 
time of data extraction.
Clinical Review of Serious Reports
All death reports after DTaP 
vaccines were manually reviewed 
by a physician. The cause of death 
was obtained from the autopsy 
report, death certificate, or medical 
records. In this review, we made 
no attempt to assess causality of 
the reported AEs. We conducted a 
clinical review of a simple random 
sample of 5% of nondeath serious 
reports after DTaP vaccines. The 
primary diagnostic category was 
assigned into a System Organ 
Class.27 We also searched for all 
reports of anaphylaxis after DTaP 
vaccines by using the following 
specific MedDRA PTs: anaphylactic 
reaction, anaphylactic shock, 
anaphylactoid reaction, and 
anaphylactoid shock. Reports of 
anaphylaxis were classified by 
using the Brighton Collaboration 
case definition or physician’s 
diagnosis.29
Data Mining
We used Empirical Bayesian data 
mining adjusted for sex and year of 
receipt of the report30 to identify 
DTaP vaccine–event combinations 
reported more frequently than 
expected among children up to 7 
years of age. In the first analysis, we 
restricted the analysis to serious 
US reports entered in VAERS as of 
December 31, 2016. In the second 
analysis, we included all serious 
and nonserious US reports as of 
December 31, 2016. We conducted 
the analyses using the Multi-Item  
γ Poisson Shrinker algorithm30, 
 
31  
in Oracle’s Empirica Signal 
System. The main statistical scores 
computed are the Empirical Bayes 
Geometric Mean, EB05, and EB95, 
the latter of which represent the 
90% confidence interval. We used 
EB05 ≥2.0 as a cutoff (the pair 
is being reported at least twice 
as often as expected) to define 
vaccine-event pairs requiring 
further evaluation.31 Elevated data 
mining statistics should not be 
interpreted as evidence of a causal 
relationship between a vaccine  
and an AE; vaccine-event 
combinations identified as potential 
signals by data mining methods 
may be useful to generate a 
hypothesis that can be tested with 
controlled studies.31, 
 
32
We clinically reviewed the 
DTaP vaccine reports with PTs 
that exceeded the data mining 
threshold. We excluded reports 
of AEs described in the vaccine 
package insert and those that, 
in the judgment of the clinicians 
(P.L.M. and M.C.), represented 
potential confounders or were 
noninformative or unspecific. 
Unspecific conditions are those 
referring to symptoms, signs, or 
laboratory tests and/or results 
that may not be assignable to a 
particular cause, condition, or 
category. Unspecific events may 
have myriad causes and are often 
noninformative on their own. 
For the remaining reports, we 
reviewed all reports for vaccine-
events pairs with disproportionate 
reporting if the total number of 
reports was ≤50. For vaccine-event 
pairs containing >50 reports, we 
reviewed a simple random sample 
of 20% of the total.
Because VAERS is a routine 
surveillance program designed to 
improve an immunization program, 
it does not meet the definition of 
research; therefore, this work was 
not subject to institutional review 
board evaluation and informed 
consent requirements.
RESULTS
VAERS received 50 157 reports 
involving receipt of DTaP vaccines 
(Infanrix, Daptacel, Pediarix,  
Kinrix, Pentacel) in the United States 
from January 1, 1991, through 
December 31, 2016 (Table 1). 
DTaP vaccines were reported as 
administered concurrently with 1 
or more other vaccines in 43 984 
(87.7%) reports. Among all DTaP 
vaccine reports, 5627 (11.2%) were 
coded as serious, including 844 
(1.7%) death reports. The most 
frequently reported PTs for all 
reports were injection site erythema 
(12 695; 25.3%), pyrexia (9913; 
19.8%), injection site swelling  
(7542; 15.0%), erythema (5599; 
11.2%), and injection site warmth 
(4793; 9.6%) (not shown in tables). 
 
Table 2 shows the 10 most common 
PTs reported for serious and 
nonserious reports.
Death Reports
In total, 844 deaths were reported 
to VAERS after receipt of DTaP 
vaccines. Death certificates, autopsy 
reports, or medical records were 
obtained for 725 (85.9%) reports 
(Table 3). Among these 725 reports, 
the most frequent cause of death 
(350 of 725; 48.3%) was sudden 
infant death syndrome (SIDS). Most 
SIDS cases (217 of 350; 62.0%) 
occurred among male infants; the 
predominant age group was infants 
<6 months of age (318 of 350; 
90.9%).
Nondeath Reports
Characteristics of a random  
sample of 240 nondeath serious 
reports (5% of the total 4783 
nondeath serious reports) occurring 
after the 5 currently licensed DTaP 
vaccines included in our analyses 
are shown in Table 4. They were 
similar when single DTaP and 
combination DTaP-containing 
vaccines were assessed separately 
(data not shown). The most common 
diagnostic categories among 
nondeath serious reports were

Downloaded from 
 neurologic conditions (60; 25.0%),  
followed by gastrointestinal 
conditions (56; 23.3%), and 
general disorders and vaccine 
administration site conditions 
(47; 19.6%). Seizure was the 
most common diagnosis among 
neurologic conditions (48 of 60; 
80%); 13 were reported as  
febrile seizures. The most  
common gastrointestinal  
diagnosis was intussusception  
(44 of 56; 78.6%); rotavirus  
vaccine was reported as 
coadministered with DTaP 
vaccine in all except 2 reports of 
intussusception.
Anaphylaxis Reports
The automated search of 
anaphylaxis reports after DTaP 
vaccines resulted in 182 reports 
with 1 or more of the specific 
MedDRA PTs. Clinical review 
revealed 12 reports of allergic 
nonanaphylactic reactions, 7 
with other nonhypersensitivity 
conditions, and 163 reports 
of anaphylaxis or possible 
anaphylaxis. Among the 163 reports 
of anaphylaxis, the median age 
was 4 years (range 0–14 years). 
Among 103 reports for which 
the symptom onset time could be 
determined, 75 (73%) occurred 
within 30 minutes postvaccination. 
Most of the DTaP vaccines 
administered (94.4%) were given 
concomitantly with other routinely 
recommended vaccines.33 Among 
the 163 reports of anaphylaxis or 
possible anaphylaxis, 62 reports 
met Brighton Level (BL) category 
1, 33 met BL category 2, and 1 
met BL category 3. Thirty-seven 
did not meet BL criteria but were 
considered as anaphylaxis by 
the attending physician. Thirty 
reports did not contain sufficient 
information for evaluation of BL.
Data Mining
The first disproportionality analysis 
included a total of 18 240 serious US 
reports. Of them, 5467 included any 
DTaP vaccine temporarily associated 
with the reported events. The 
analysis revealed an elevated EB05 
(≥2.0) for 9 vaccine-event pairs, 
all of them related to injection site 
reactions, urticaria, and  
anaphylaxis.
The second analysis included a total 
of 159 818 serious and nonserious 
US reports; 46 798 corresponded 
to DTaP vaccines. The data mining 
analyses revealed an elevated 
EB05 for 55 vaccine-event pairs 
for DTaP vaccines that fulfilled 
criteria to be reviewed. No new or 
unexpected AEs were detected, but 
we identified 3 types of vaccination 
errors disproportionally reported: 
incorrect product formulation  
(n = 26; no AEs reported), product 
quality issue (n = 23), and drug 
administered at inappropriate  
site (n = 19). Most AEs reported 
(53%; 36 of 68) after these 
vaccination errors included  
mild injection site reactions.  
Most (74%; 17 of 23) reports  
of incorrect product formulation 
administered involved inadvertent 
administration of only 1 of the 
components of the vaccine (ie, 
vaccine administrator neglected  
to combine all the components  
per the manufacturer’s package 
insert).
DISCUSSION
We performed a review of AE reports 
received over the course of 19 years 
after administration of currently 
licensed DTaP vaccines in VAERS.

 This included automated analysis of 
all reports, clinical review of death 
reports and a sample of serious 
reports, and data mining analyses to 
assess disproportionate reporting. 
Our findings were consistent with 
those from prelicensure trials and 
postlicensure studies for these 
vaccines.5 
– 
10
The most common PTs observed 
among nonserious and serious 
reports were injection site reactions 
(eg, injection site erythema) and 
certain systemic reactions (eg, fever, 
vomiting), findings consistent with 
those from prelicensure clinical 
trials.5 
– 
10 Several postmarketing 
studies also noted the occurrence 
of these AEs.11 
– 
22 A retrospective 
cohort study in the Vaccine Safety 
Datalink (VSD) found that the 
rate of local reactions after DTaP 
vaccines was higher than for 
inactivated influenza or hepatitis A 
vaccines. The study also revealed 
that for children aged 12 to 35 
months, vaccination in the arm 
was associated with a significantly 
greater risk of local reactions 
compared with vaccination in the 
thigh.14
Seizures or convulsions ranked 
as the fourth most common PT 
among serious reports. Febrile 
convulsions are a type of seizures 
relatively common in childhood, 
occurring in 2% to 4% of 
individuals.34 Febrile seizures may 
be related to febrile infections and 
have also been associated with 
DTwP, pneumococcal 13-valent 
conjugate, and trivalent inactivated 
influenza vaccines.34 Seizures 
had been observed sporadically 
during prelicensure clinical trials 
for Pentacel, Daptacel, Pediarix, 
and Infanrix.5 
– 
8 The authors of 
a retrospective observational 
study in the VSD did not find an 
increased risk of seizures among 
children aged 6 weeks to 23 months 
who received DTaP.12 A recent 
safety study on simultaneous 
administration of DTaP with other 
vaccines revealed a small increased 
risk for febrile seizures during the 
24 hours after a child receives the 
inactivated influenza vaccine at the 
same time as the pneumococcal 
13-valent conjugate vaccine or 
DTaP.20
Among death reports for which 
sufficient records were available for 
review, SIDS was the leading cause 
of death (48%), which is consistent 
with infant mortality data that 
places SIDS as the fourth leading 
cause of death in the United States 
among infants.35 Similarly, SIDS was 
the second leading cause of death

of sudden unexplained infant death 
after DTaP vaccine administration,  
which was introduced in that 
country in 2010, 
37 and found 
DTaP vaccine administration did 
not increase the risk of sudden 
unexplained infant death. SIDS in the 
United States have been declining

factors that include recommended 
changes in sleeping position and

–44 
including an Institute of Medicine 
review in 2003 that rejected a  
causal association between the 
DTwP vaccine (which is no longer in 
use in the United States) and SIDS, 
as well as between exposure to 
multiple simultaneous vaccines and 
SIDS.40 It would not be uncommon 
to observe a coincidental close 
temporal relationship between 
vaccination and SIDS because this 
condition peaks at a time when 
children receive a  
relatively large number of 
recommended vaccinations.43  
Other common causes of death 
observed (eg, asphyxia or 
suffocation, pneumonia, or 
sepsis or septicemia) are  
consistent with the top 10 leading 
causes of death in the vaccinated  
age groups.35
Through data mining, we found 
disproportional reporting for 
injection site reactions. Increased 
local reactogenicity after a booster 
of DTaP-containing vaccines has 
been well documented, and it 
has been potentially attributed 
to cellular and humoral immune 
responses to the vaccine.45, 
 
46 We 
also found higher disproportional 
reporting mainly for other 
labeled events, “intussusception, 
” 
“hematochezia, 
” and other related 
gastrointestinal conditions that 
may have been related to the 
concomitant administration of 
rotavirus vaccines for which the 
associations with intussusception 
and/or hematochezia have been 
well documented.46 
– 
49 Through 
our clinical review of a sample 
of serious DTaP reports, we also 
noted that intussusception was the 
most common diagnosis among 
gastrointestinal events, and in all 
these selected reports, rotavirus 
vaccines were coadministered 
with a DTaP vaccine. Data mining 
findings involving the PT “apparent 
life-threatening event” (ALTE) did 
not report a specific condition, 
but rather a variety of serious 
conditions (eg, seizures, high fever, 
or apneic events) reported as 
ALTE by the attending physician. 
ALTE has been replaced by the 
term “brief resolved unexplained 
event.” 
50
A number of vaccination errors 
were disproportionally reported 
for DTaP vaccines. Some of 
these errors involved the 
administration of the incorrect 
vaccine or vaccine formulation 
or administration of vaccine at 
the wrong site. Education and 
training of providers on Advisory 
Committee on Immunization 
Practices recommendations and 
package insert indications may help 
alleviate and prevent these errors.
Although our study cannot 
be compared with controlled, 
denominator-based studies, the 
authors of 2 observational studies 
in the VSD assessed the safety of 
DTaP-IPV-Hib (Pentacel) and DTaP-
IPV (Kinrix).17, 
 
18 The authors of the 
first study compared children aged 
6 weeks to 2 years who received 
DTaP-IPV-Hib (Pentacel) with 
children who received other DTaP-
containing vaccines. Children who 
received DTaP-IPV-Hib vaccine had 
a statistically significant higher risk 
of fever, but no increased risk was 
observed for seizure; meningitis, 
encephalitis, and myelitis; or 
nonanaphylactic allergic reaction. 
The second study of Kinrix in 
children aged 4 to 6 years did 
not find a statistically significant 
increased risk of meningitis 
and/or encephalitis, seizures, 
stroke, Guillain-Barré Syndrome,

Strengths of VAERS include its broad 
national scope and timeliness.25 
VAERS may be particularly useful 
for detecting potential safety signals, 
which can be further evaluated in 
larger data sets by using controlled 
epidemiologic methodologies. As a 
passive surveillance system, VAERS 
has several inherent limitations that 
call for careful interpretation of its 
findings. Some of these limitations 
include over- or underreporting, 
biased reporting, and inconsistency 
in quality and completeness of 
reports.25 VAERS generally cannot 
assess if a vaccine caused an AE. 
VAERS does not collect data on 
number of vaccines; therefore, it does 
not provide denominator data to 
calculate incidence rates of AEs.
Our review did not include the 
recently licensed Quadracel vaccine 
because few reports for this vaccine 
had been received in VAERS  
at the time of data extraction.10  
The safety of this vaccine will  
be assessed once a larger number  
of reports has been  
received.
CONCLUSIONS
In this assessment of the safety of 
DTaP vaccines (Infanrix, Daptacel, 
Kinrix, Pediarix, and Pentacel), 
we did not identify any new or 
unexpected safety issues. However, 
the presence of vaccination errors 
calls for measures to prevent their 
occurrence. CDC and FDA will 
continue to monitor AEs after DTaP 
vaccination in VAERS.
