Abstract
Background: In recent years, we witnessed a resurgence of measles even in countries where, according to WHO
guidelines, elimination should have already been achieved. In high-income countries, the raise of anti-vaccination
movements and parental vaccine hesitancy are posing major challenges for the achievement and maintenance of
high coverage during routine programmes. Italy and France approved new regulations, respectively in 2017 and
2018, aimed at raising immunisation rates among children by introducing mandatory vaccination at school entry.
Methods: We simulated the evolution of measles immunity profiles in seven distinct countries for the period
2018–2050 and evaluated the effect of possible adjustments of immunisation strategies adopted in the past
on the overall fraction and age distribution of susceptible individuals in different high-income demographic
settings. The proposed model accounts for country-specific demographic components, current immunity gaps
and immunisation activities in 2018. Vaccination strategies considered include the enhancement of coverage
for routine programmes already in place and the introduction of a compulsory vaccination at primary school
entry in countries where universal school enrolment is likely achieved.
Results: Our model shows that, under current vaccination policies, the susceptible fraction of the population
would remain below measles elimination threshold only in Singapore and South Korea. In the UK, Ireland, the
USA and Australia either the increase of coverage of routine programmes above 95% or the introduction of a
compulsory vaccination at school entry with coverage above 40% are needed to maintain susceptible individuals below
7.5% up to 2050. Although the implementation of mandatory vaccination at school entry would be surely beneficial in
Italy, strategies targeting adults would also be required to avoid future outbreaks in this country.
Conclusions: Current vaccination policies are not sufficient to achieve and maintain measles elimination in
most countries. Strategies targeting unvaccinated children before they enter primary school can remarkably
enhance the fulfilment of WHO targets.

 Background
In 2010, the World Health Assembly set three mile-
stones with the objective of measles elimination. These
include the increase of routine coverage with a first dose
of measles-containing vaccine to ≥ 90%, the reduction of
global annual incidence to less than 5 cases per million
and a 95% decrease of global mortality from the 2000 es-
timates [1]. While substantial progress towards these
goals has been documented, regional elimination targets
have not been met yet [2].
Measles still represents one of the main causes of child
mortality in low-income countries [1] but it now poses
serious challenges also in regions where elimination was
declared in the last decade [3, 4].
In 2017, measles cases reported to the World Health
Organization (WHO) amounted to 173,330 worldwide
and measles incidence rates were among the highest in
Italy and Romania. Although measles cases reported to
WHO may represent 2% of measles cases worldwide [1]
and reporting rates are likely to be much higher in coun-
tries with better access to care [5], the European region
has experienced a fourfold increase of reported cases
compared to the previous year [6] and 35 deaths.
Current and future trends of measles epidemiology in
different countries are certainly dependent on the back-
ground demographic conditions as well as on the effect-
iveness of past immunisation activities in reducing the
susceptible fraction of the population [7]. In regions with
currently high two-dose vaccination coverage, future sus-
tained measles transmission may arise from individuals
who are still susceptible as a consequence of low vaccine
uptake experienced in the past [3, 7, 8]. In particular, the
median age at infection observed between 2015 and 2016
in Mongolia [9] and in 2017 in Italy [3, 7] was around 27
years of age, therefore suggesting remarkable immunity
gaps among adolescents and young adults.
However, even countries with a history of strong mea-
sles immunisation programmes, like South Korea, the
UK and the USA, may be threatened in the near future
by possible changes in public compliance to vaccination
[10, 11], the sustained transmission in adjacent regions
[12] or the low immunisation rates in closed communi-
ties [4, 13]. These complexities would contribute in mak-
ing measles elimination difficult to be achieved and
maintained also in high-income countries.
Following declining trends of routine coverage levels
arisen from anti-vaccination movements and ‘hesitant
compliers’ [10, 11], the Italian and French governments
made MMR vaccination compulsory for children before
they enter primary school [14, 15]. Similarly, the state of
South Australia, following the example of the state of
Victoria, proposed a new regulation to forbid the enrol-
ment of unvaccinated children in kindergartens and day-
care centres [16], also called the ‘No jab, No play’ policy.
A modelling framework aimed at uncovering measles
immunity gaps in different socioeconomic settings [7] is
here extended to investigate the potential impact of dif-
ferent
policies
to
reinforce
immunisation
rates
in
high-income countries. In particular, we compare the ef-
fect of enhancing vaccination coverage of routine pro-
grammes with the impact of introducing compulsory
vaccination at school entry on the residual measles sus-
ceptibility in the next 30 years.
The carried out analysis focuses on seven countries
with a two-dose measles programme already in place
and a high primary school enrolment rate [17], but char-
acterised by different demographic conditions and vac-
cination histories: the USA, South Korea, Singapore,
Australia, Italy, the UK and Ireland.
Methods
Initial conditions on the fraction of susceptible and im-
mune individuals in 2018 are estimated using a deter-
ministic age structured transmission model introduced
and calibrated in Trentini et al. [7]. Specifically, the
model was parametrised, separately for each country, in
such a way to reproduce different serological profiles re-
ported for the seven countries considered at different
time points. A detailed description of model structure
and calibration can be found in [7].
In this work, we extend the model to simulate, for
each country, how the susceptibility of the host popula-
tion would change in the future, under current and add-
itional vaccination programmes. Changes in measles
immunity profiles caused by alternative immunisation
strategies and coverage scenarios are simulated for the
period 2018–2050, by neglecting the potential impact of
the circulation of the infection to estimate the temporal
changes in the overall fraction and age distribution of in-
dividuals at risk of measles infection after 2018. The
fraction of residual susceptibility estimated in a given
year y > 2018 therefore include individuals who may ex-
perience natural infection between 2018 and y, due to
possible measles resurgence between 2018 and y.
Country-specific crude birth rates and age-specific
mortality rates, as estimated by United Nations World
Population Prospect (Additional file 1: 1.2 Demographic
data), are explicitly taken into account. Country-specific
routine vaccination activities along with recent adjust-
ments adopted in some countries are simulated by mim-
icking schedule and coverage data reported by the
World Health Organization and complemented with in-
formation available at the country level [7]. Different
coverage scenarios are considered to assess the impact
of an increase in vaccine uptake under current routine
strategies. In addition, a vaccination policy targeting un-
vaccinated school age children is simulated on the basis
of indications given by public health authorities and

 National Health Institutes of Italy and France [14, 15],
where compulsory vaccination at school entry has re-
cently been introduced (Additional file 1: 2 Additional
results). Vaccination at school entry is also considered in
combination with a catch-up campaign among individ-
uals in mandatory school classes in 2018, as indicated in
the guidelines associated with the new Italian law [15].
We therefore investigate (i) a baseline scenario where
routine programmes and coverage levels remain un-
changed as before the introduction of compulsory vac-
cination at school entry in Italy and Australia; (ii) a
scenario where coverage levels associated with the base-
line vaccination activities are assumed to vary between
60 and 100%; (iii) a scenario where baseline vaccination
activities are complemented with vaccination at school
entry, implemented on the basis of country-specific
compulsory school programmes (Additional file 1: 2
Additional results), with coverage levels between 20 and
100%; and (iv) a scenario where baseline vaccination ac-
tivities are complemented with vaccination at school
entry and a catch-up campaign among 1–15 years old in
2018 with coverage levels of both strategies assumed to
vary between 20 and 100%.
In our model, only individuals who have been previ-
ously vaccinated with a first dose are considered eligible
for the second dose routine programme. This assump-
tion is based on the fact that sub-optimal coverage is ex-
pected to characterise in the same way both first and
second dose administration. For example, it is likely that
parents of children who opposed the first vaccine ad-
ministration will oppose to the second dose as well. This
means
that
the
major
benefit
of
the
two-dose
programme is the reduction in the proportion of persons
who remain susceptible because of primary vaccine fail-
ure, therefore increasing immunisation rates among vac-
cines [18]. In contrast, vaccination at school entry and
catch-up campaigns aim at immunising children who
were not vaccinated during routine programmes there-
fore increasing the overall vaccine uptake. In particular,
in the model, individuals who had already had one dose
of measles-containing vaccine were not considered eli-
gible for school-entry vaccination. The considered cover-
age levels of school entry vaccination and catch-up
campaign should be therefore interpreted as the propor-
tion of vaccinated individuals among those who has
never been vaccinated prior school entry or before the
campaign itself.
Vaccine efficacy is assumed at 95% [19] and success-
fully immunised individuals are assumed to gain lifelong
protection against measles infection.
The transmission potential of an infectious disease is
defined by the basic reproduction number R0, which
represents the average number of secondary infections
generated by a typical index case in a fully susceptible
population during the entire period of infectiousness. R0
can be used to estimate the proportion of immune indi-
viduals p required in a population to interrupt transmis-
sion as p = 1–1/R0. Although there is evidence that
ranges for measles basic reproduction number may vary
highly across different geographic regions due to local
conditions [7, 20], available classical estimates on R0
range between 12 and 18 [21], therefore defining the
fraction of successfully vaccinated individuals (p) re-
quired for elimination between 92 and 94%. In our ana-
lysis, we assume that persistent measles elimination is
achieved only when the fraction of residual susceptible
individuals is maintained under the 7.5% of the popula-
tion in the medium-long term. Distance between the es-
timated percentage of immune individuals in 2050 and
the immunity level required for measles elimination is
used to provide a quantitative measure of adequateness
of current and alternative policies and coverage levels,
while accounting for realistic country-specific temporal
changes in the age structure of the host population.
Results
The impact of routine vaccination activities in place be-
fore recent adjustments of immunisation policies on the
amount and age distribution of residual susceptibility, as
estimated for the years 2018 and 2050, is represented in
Fig. 1. In the baseline scenario, coverage levels of routine
programmes between 2018 and 2050 are assumed equal
to those reported by WHO for 2018 [5].
The residual measles susceptibility in 2018 in the
seven countries under study is estimated to lie between
3.7% (95% CI 3.2–4.2) in the UK and 9.3% (95% CI 8.3–
10.4) in Italy. Remarkably, according to model estimates,
in Italy, the current proportion of susceptible individuals
is above the elimination threshold of 7.5%. The largest
immunity gaps are found among individuals older than
10 years of age in all countries (Additional file 1: 1.3 Ini-
tial susceptibility distribution).
Coherently with findings of recent studies [7, 8],
sub-optimal coverage levels experienced in the past and
the progressive ageing of the population have contrib-
uted to a marked replacement of individuals who were
immune as a consequence of natural infection with sus-
ceptible individuals who have been neither infected nor
vaccinated. This phenomenon is expected to persist in
the near future. Indeed, low measles circulation would
cause the progressive replacement of the eldest cohorts
of the population, who have acquired natural immunity
during the pre-vaccination era, with new birth cohorts
that are only partially immunised with vaccination. As a
consequence, our results show that, should the coverage
levels of current programmes remain unchanged, the
percentage of individuals at risk of infection is expected
to increase between 2018 and 2050 by more than 50% in
Trentini et al. BMC Medicine           (2019) 17:86 
Page 3 of 8
 all countries except from South Korea, where it is ex-
pected to increase by roughly 17%. This means that, by
2050, the estimated proportions of individuals at risk of
infection would exceed the elimination threshold and
put most of the considered countries at risk of measles
outbreaks and resurgence.
Remarkably, the estimated residual susceptibility level
in 2050 in Italy reaches 14.8% (95% CI 13.5–16.1) of the
population, with more than 50% of susceptible individ-
uals older than 25 years of age (see Fig. 1).
On the opposite, our results also suggest that in
Singapore and South Korea, where coverage levels for
routine programmes are above 95%, the estimated per-
centage of individuals younger than 50 years of age at
risk of infection in 2050 would fall below 5%, so that
measles elimination would be likely achieved and main-
tained in the next future.
We investigated whether baseline routine programmes
are enough to achieve and maintain measles elimination.
Coverage levels between 60 and 100% were considered.
We found that, in all countries with the exception of
Italy, coverage levels above or equal to 95% for both first
and second routine doses would allow to reach the 7.5%
threshold for herd immunity (see Fig. 2). These results
stress the potential of baseline routine programmes in
achieving and maintaining high immunisation rates
among children and are perfectly in agreement with
WHO guidelines on measles immunisation. For instance,

 the cases of Singapore and South Korea show how small
deviations from optimal immunisation rates, e.g. 90%
coverage or lower, would quickly put at risk of future
outbreaks even countries where high coverage levels
have been already achieved in the past.
In Italy, routine vaccination programmes have the po-
tential to dramatically mitigate the increase in measles
susceptibility. However, 100% coverage in both the first
and the second dose is expected to reduce the fraction
of susceptible individuals in 2050 to around 10% of the
overall population, and additional vaccination strategies
may therefore be needed to achieve measles elimination
in this country.
Temporal changes in measles susceptibility is also in-
vestigated when current routine programmes are com-
bined with vaccination at school entry and with a
catch-up campaign in 2018 on children between 1 and
15 years of age. This vaccination strategy aims at target-
ing unvaccinated individuals and increasing vaccine up-
take and coverage levels among children. Obtained
results show that for coverage levels greater than 40%,
the implementation from 2018 onwards of this add-
itional immunisation activity on top of baseline pro-
grammes
can
reduce
the
susceptible
fraction
of
individuals below 7.5% of the population within 2050 in
the UK, Ireland and the USA and Australia (Fig. 3).
Interestingly, for coverage levels greater than 40%, both
South Korea and Singapore would reach susceptibility
levels below 3%, for individuals younger than 50 years of
age, proving to be currently among the countries with
the highest immunisation rates in children. The largest
fraction
of susceptible
individuals
would
be
found
among adults, who are known to have lower contact
rates and being therefore associated with a lower trans-
missibility potential. Similarly, in Italy, by assuming fully
compliance to the recently approved vaccination law
[15] (i.e. 100% coverage), vaccination at school entry
would
determine
acceptable
levels
of
susceptibility
(around 8.9%; 95% CI 7.9–10), the largest part of which
due to immunity gaps among individuals older than 50
years of age. However, our results strongly highlight that,
especially for more realistic coverage levels [22], the new
vaccination policy introduced in Italy may not be suffi-
cient to prevent measles resurgence in the country.
For all countries considered, the fraction of children at
risk of infection is expected to be slightly larger, with re-
spect to results reported above, if vaccination at school
entry (performed annually) was implemented without a
catch-up campaign among 1–15 years old (performed
only once in 2018) (Additional file 1: 2 Additional
results).
Discussion
Effective vaccination policies should be able to both
mitigate the natural replenishment of susceptible indi-
viduals due to new births and reduce the residual sus-
ceptibility among individuals who escaped both routine
vaccination programmes and natural infection in the
past. After decades of universal vaccination of children,
further enhancements of measles immunisation rates
may
require
country-specific
vaccination
strategies
taking into account immunity gaps expected across
different socio-demographic settings and country-spe-
cific difficulties in implementing different vaccination

 programmes [3, 5–7, 23]. The multi-country perspective
adopted in our study allows to investigate the potential
impact of current and alternative
vaccination
pro-
grammes across countries with different immunisation
histories and demographic components and to identify
the feasibility of measles elimination goals [1] within
2050. Vaccination strategies considered in this study are
motivated by the stagnation of vaccination coverage
levels for routine programmes observed in high-income
countries and laws approved in Italy and in France in
2017 and 2018 [14, 15], requiring parents to vaccinate
their children against measles infection by school entry.
Our results suggest that most of countries would
strongly benefit from the introduction of compulsory
vaccination at school entry in addition to current routine
immunisation programmes. In particular, we found that
this strategy would allow the UK, Ireland and the USA
to reach stable herd immunity levels in the next decades
and therefore the achievement of persisting measles
elimination.
Countries like Singapore and South Korea, who have
been able to reach high coverage levels among children,
are expected to maintain low levels of residual suscepti-
bility both in children and young adults. South Korea
in particular has reached a high level of herd immunity
thanks to past immunisation policies, so that additional
strategies seem not to be currently required. However,
a careful surveillance is needed even in these countries,
as clustering of susceptible people and small deviations
of current vaccine uptake could still trigger measles
resurgence [12].
In high-income countries where typically a larger frac-
tion of susceptible individuals is found across elder ages,
the strengthening of routine immunisation efforts at
younger ages is fundamental but may not be enough to
achieve measles elimination. This is the case of Italy,
where more than 70% of cases occurred during the re-
cent large measles outbreak has been recorded among
individuals older than 15 years of age [3]. Although the
importance of the compulsory school vaccination law
approved last year is indisputable [24] and coverage
levels for routine campaign have increased in the last
months [22], the interruption of measles circulation
would also require further efforts to reduce susceptibility
in older age groups [3, 7].
The focus of our work is on the potential impact of
immunisation strategies in reducing the proportion of
individuals at risk of infection in the future. As such, in
our analysis, we did not consider measles transmission
between 2018 and 2050. Although the occurrence and
magnitude of future measles epidemics are largely un-
certain and difficult to predict [25], it is worth stressing
that sufficiently high level of susceptibility in the popula-
tion can promote measles circulation before 2050,
therefore reducing the fraction of susceptible individuals
in the host population. Our estimates of the residual
susceptibility over time should be therefore carefully
interpreted as representing, for each year considered, the
fraction of individuals who either is still susceptible to
measles infection or has experienced a natural infection
after 2018.
The
threshold
defining
measles
elimination
is
chosen under the assumption of homogeneous mix-
ing; therefore, it does not account for the heterogen-
eity of contact patterns among different age strata. In
particular, for those countries where a large fraction
of residual susceptibility is expected among adults, as
in Italy, measles elimination may be achieved even
when the proportion of susceptible individuals is lar-
ger than 7.5% of the population. In addition, our
model does not take into account spatial heterogene-
ities in measles susceptibility as possibly resulting
from different vaccination coverage at sub-national
level. However, it has been recently shown that the
assumption of spatially homogeneous coverage could
potentially
lead
to
underestimate
the
effective
reproduction number [26]. Therefore, the achievement
of
the
7.5%
susceptibility
threshold
may
not
be
enough to sustain measles elimination
in
settings
characterised by heterogeneous vaccine uptake levels.
Moreover, our estimates were obtained under the
assumption that, at birth, all individuals are protected
by maternal antibodies, and that there is no vaccine
waning immunity. Although it is likely that children
born from susceptible mothers have no maternal pro-
tection against the infection, we show that the robust-
ness of our results is not affected by this assumption
(Additional file 1: 1.5 Sensitivity analysis on maternal
antibodies protection). On the other hand, although
sporadic
measles
cases
have
been
documented
in
adults who received two doses of vaccine decades be-
fore the onset of disease [3], cases among vaccinated
individuals may also arise as a consequence of vaccine
failure after multiple-doses administration, and less
than 2% of individuals is proven to loose protective
measles immunity per decade [27].
Finally, in our model, children who had already
had one dose of measles-containing vaccine were not
considered
eligible
for
school-entry
vaccination.
Although-in principle–children who had only had
one previous dose of vaccine may be also targeted
by vaccination at school entry and two doses of vac-
cines may be administered to individuals who have
never been vaccinated, the assumption we made may
apply to a broader set of countries and epidemio-
logical conditions, highlighting the potential impact
of school entry vaccination under a more conserva-
tive scenario.

 Conclusions
We believe our findings contribute to the ongoing discus-
sion on the most effective ways to achieve measles elimin-
ation goals and stress the importance of considering
adjustments of current immunisation strategies, especially
in countries where these appear underperforming. Recent
policies aimed at increasing childhood immunisation rates
through the introduction of compulsory vaccination are
certainly producing positive effects, by raising the propor-
tion of children protected against measles [24]. However,
additional efforts designed specifically for each country
should also be put in place to successfully achieve and
maintain measles elimination in the medium-long term.
