tudies have shown depression to be associated with short-
ened life expectancy.1 In Cuijpers and colleagues’ meta-
analysis of 293 studies, depression was associated with a 
50% increased risk of mortality.2 There are 3 gaps in our under-
standing of the association between depression and mortality 
burden: the duration of time over which depression carries an 
increased risk of mortality, secular trends in the association 
between depression and mortality, and sex differences in the 
association between depression and mortality.
The duration of time over which depression increases mortality 
risk can provide insight into underlying mechanisms. Mortality risk 
over relatively short periods of time could be attributed to unnatural 
causes of death, including suicide and unintentional injuries — which 
are demonstrably elevated among individuals with depression.3,4 In 
contrast, mortality risk over longer periods of time may be more likely 
to result from chronic conditions associated with depression.5–8 The 
question of duration is also important, from a clinical perspective: a 
history of depression is a strong predictor of later recurrence, and 
according to long-term follow-up studies, as many as one-third of indi-
viduals with depression will have a chronic form of the disorder.9–11
Any analysis of long-term elevations in mortality risk follow-
ing depressive episodes should also consider secular trends, 
given broader changes in society; the past half-century has 
seen a reduction in the stigma associated with depression, an 
increased awareness of depression and the development of 
more tolerable and effective treatments for depression.12,13 
Methodological differences across existing studies make it diffi-
cult to draw inferences regarding secular trends.14 Further-
more, despite higher rates of depression among women,15 it is 
unclear whether depression is associated with mortality among 
both sexes.7,16 Addressing these gaps requires population-
based data on depression and subsequent mortality over a 
long period.
Accordingly, we investigated depression and mortality in the 
1952, 1970 and 1992 Stirling County Study samples. Previous 
reports from the Stirling County Study showed increased risk of 
mortality among participants with depression in the 1952 sample 
who were followed through 196817–19 and through 1992,16 and 
increased mortality risk associated with depression among par-
ticipants in the 1970 sample followed through 1992.20 Here, we

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Many studies have 
shown that depression increases mor-
tality risk. We aimed to investigate the 
duration of time over which depression 
is associated with increased risk of mor-
tality, secular trends in the association 
between depression and mortality, and 
sex differences in the association 
between depression and mortality.
METHODS: We conducted a cohort study 
 
of 3410 adults enrolled in 3 representa-
tive samples of a county in Atlantic Can-
ada in 1952 (n = 1003), 1970 (n = 1203) or 
1992 (n = 1402) (the Stirling County 
Study). Depression was measured using a 
diagnostic algorithm based on the pres-
ence of depressed mood and associated 
symptoms, duration of more than 1 
month, and substantial impairment. Vital 
status of participants through 2011 was 
determined using probabilistic linkages 
to the Canadian Mortality Database.
RESULTS: Depression was associated 
with a heightened risk of mortality 
among men during the 3 time periods of 
the study, with hazard ratios (HRs) of 
2.90 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.69–
4.98) between 1952 and 1967, 1.97 (CI 
1.34–2.89) between 1968 and 1990, and 
1.52 (CI 1.09–2.13) between 1991 and 
2011. Elevated risk of mortality was 
noted among women only between 1990 
and 2011 (HR = 1.51; CI = 1.11–2.05).
INTERPRETATION: The association be-
tween depression and mortality persists 
over long periods of time and has emerged 
among women in recent decades, despite 
contemporaneous improvements in the 
treatment of depression and reduction of 
stigma associated with depression. Fur-
ther research is needed to better under-
stand the mechanisms involved.

extend these studies of the mortality experiences of 1952 and 
1970 samples through 2011, as well as report for the first time on 
the mortality experience of the 1992 sample through 2011. 
Methods
Sample
Three representative samples of adults were recruited from a 
county in Atlantic Canada with about 20 000 residents, which has 
been given the pseudonym “Stirling”: the first in 1952 (n = 1003), 
the second in 1970 (n = 1203) and the third in 1992 (n = 1402).21 In 
1952, households from the county were sampled and an adult 
was randomly selected within each household, whereas in 1970 
and 1992, individuals were randomly sampled from the full 
county census. Because the 3 samples were drawn indepen-
dently, 5% (n = 183) were selected for inclusion in more than 1 
sample. The current investigation is based on 3410 Stirling 
County Study participants who provided data on depression sta-
tus at one or more interviews.
Measures
Depression in the Stirling County Study was assessed using DPAX 
(DP for depression and AX for anxiety), a diagnostic algorithm 
similar to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disor-
ders, 3rd edition (DSM-III).22–25 A diagnosis of DPAX depression 
requires the presence of the essential features of depressed 
mood in addition to associated symptoms such as change in 
appetite, sleep and activity, of 1-month duration, and impair-
ment in everyday functioning. DPAX compared favourably with 
several other types of diagnostic assessments, showing high val-
ues of sensitivity and specificity (i.e., usually 80% to 90%).24–28
Vital status of Stirling County Study participants through Dec. 
31, 2011, was determined using probabilistic linkages to the Cana-
dian Mortality Database. The first linkage covered deaths that 
occurred through Dec. 31, 1992 (1047 deaths observed).16 The sec-
ond is a newly completed linkage of the Stirling County Study 1992 
survivors (n = 2586) to the mortality database that covers deaths 
that occurred through Dec. 31, 2011 (1014 deaths observed). The 
database linkage was implemented using the Generalized Iterative 
Record Linkage System,29,30 which generates probability ratios for 
each potential match between records in the study cohort and the 
Canadian Mortality Database based on participants’ names, par-
ents’ names, date of birth, sex and postal code. Matches with high 
probability ratios were retained and low probability ratios dis-
carded, and remaining matches were resolved manually.
Analyses
We fitted Cox proportional hazards models to the time-to-event 
outcome of date of death (for decedents), or censoring on Dec. 
31, 2011, yielding hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs).31 These models used age as the time 
scale, thereby accounting for variation in age at entry into the 
sample. We considered 3 roughly equal time periods in the analy-
ses: 1952 to 1967, 1968 to 1990, and 1991 to 2011. All analyses 
were conducted separately for men and women (with interac-
tions involving sex tested in combined-sex analyses).
Calendar-time by depression interactions were tested to eval-
uate secular trends in the association between depression and 
mortality and assess the proportional hazards assumption. We 
also fitted models adjusted for the following factors measured 
upon participants’ enrolment into the study, as these could 
potentially be explanatory factors for the association between 
depression and mortality: education (lower than 5th grade, 5th 
to 10th grade, 11th grade or higher), smoking (nonsmoker: 
smokes 1 to 19 cigarettes per day; smoker: smokes 20 or more 
cigarettes per day), alcohol abuse as observed by a primary care 
provider, and obesity as defined by a body mass index above 30.
As follow-up data regarding depression status were available 
from those re-interviewed in 1970 or 1992, depression was mod-
elled as time-varying, updating information from each subse-
quent interview in the calculation of hazard ratios. Depression 
status for participants alive but not re-interviewed at later waves 
was treated as time-invariant. In addition, we calculated life 
expectancies at age 25 for depressed and nondepressed men 
and women in each sample using abridged period life tables.32
Ethics approval
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of 
the Massachusetts General Hospital and the Ottawa Health Sci-
ence Network Research Ethics Board.
Results
The characteristics of participants in the Stirling County Study 
samples are provided in Table 1. Participation rates throughout 
the course of the Stirling County Study ranged between 79% and 
91%; Figure 1 depicts the number of participants enrolled and 
retained in each sample over time. The prevalence of current 
depression at each time point ranged from 6% in the 1952 and 
1970 samples to 6.5% in the 1992 sample, and was generally 
higher among women than men. The mean age at enrolment into 
the study was 49.7 years in 1952, 49.1 years in 1970 and 49.6 
years in 1992. The number of deaths observed during the follow-
up period was 925 in the 1952 sample, 854 in the 1970 sample 
and 444 in the 1992 sample (for the distribution of causes of 
death, see Appendix 1, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl 
/
doi:10.1503/cmaj.170125/-/DC1).
On average, men and women with depression had shorter life 
expectancies in young adulthood than their nondepressed coun-
terparts: a difference of 10 to 12 years in the 1952 sample, 7 years 
in the 1970 sample (men) and 7 to 18 years in the 1992 sample. In 
general, life expectancies at age 25 were lower for men than for 
women (Table 2). In the 3 combined samples, the median follow-
up time was 19 years (interquartile range 16–36).
Results of survival analyses of the association between 
depression and mortality, by sex and calendar time, are pre-
sented in Table 3. The study’s results were unchanged in sensitiv-
ity analyses that retained these individuals only in their first-
enrolled sample. 
Among men, the mortality risk associated with depression 
over the 3 calendar periods was most pronounced in the study’s 
early years and diminished substantially over time. The period-
 RESEARCH
E1306 
CMAJ  |  OCTOBER 23, 2017  |  VOLUME 189  |  ISSUE 42 
specific hazard ratios were as follows: 2.90 (95% CI 1.69–4.98) 
between 1952 and 1967, 1.97 (95% CI 1.32–2.89) between 1968 
and 1990, and 1.52 (95% CI 1.09–2.13) between 1991 and 2011. 
Among women, there was little evidence for excess mortality 
risk among those with depression in the early years of the study, 
but a statistically significant one emerged over time. The period-
specific hazard ratios for women were 1.08 (95% CI 0.53–2.22) 
between 1952 and 1967, 1.37 (95% CI 0.90–2.07) between 1968 
and 1991, and 1.51 (95% CI 1.11–2.05) between 1990 and 2011. By 
the end of the study period, the mortality risk associated with 
depression among both men and women converged to a similar 
degree of excess risk, which was not substantially altered after 
adjusting for education, smoking, obesity and alcohol use.
The results of survival analyses of the 3 Stirling County Study 
samples (1952, 1970 and 1992) are presented in Table 4. Where 
there was a significant association between depression and mor-
tality, it was apparent only in the period encompassing the par-
ticipants’ first interview. Thus, for men in the 1952 sample, 
depression was associated with a 2.83 higher hazard of mortality 
(CI 1.65–4.87) through 1967, but not in later periods. When 
depression status in the participants’ most recent interview was 
considered, the attenuation of hazard ratios in later periods was 
less pronounced. 
Interpretation
This study addresses the long-term association between depres-
sion and mortality — the duration of increased risk, secular 
trends over the past 6 decades and sex differences. The major 
finding from this study is that depression measured at any given 
point in time during the study carries an elevated risk of mortal-
ity that persists for as long as 2 decades. Our results show that a 
depressive episode confers an elevated risk of mortality that 
eventually decays over time unless there is a recurrent depres-
sive episode, in which case the mortality risk associated with 
depression remains elevated. This decay was also reported in

Cuijpers and colleagues’ meta-analysis.2 Within an individual, the 
effect of a depressive episode on survival may decay over time 
unless depression recurs.
In addition, there appears to have been a secular trend char-
acterized by a reduced impact of depression during the course of 
the last 6 decades, which has not been directly examined in pre-
vious studies. This secular trend may reflect increasing aware-
ness of mental illness, decreasing stigma and improved treat-
ment of depression in more recent calendar periods.
We also observed a significant secular trend by sex in the 
association between depression and mortality. Whereas the mor-
tality risk associated with depression was observed primarily 
among men in the early decades of the follow-up period, an 
increased mortality risk among depressed women emerged in 
the later decades of the study, beginning in the 1990s. In the last 
calendar period analyzed (1991–2011), the mortality risk associ-
ated with depression was the same for both sexes (HR 1.5). Previ-
ous studies generally found a higher mortality burden of depres-
sion among men than women.33,34 However, these studies 
followed single cohorts of individuals and thus could not assess 
secular trends in gender differences in mortality associated with 
depression.
The long-term mortality burden of depression may reflect the 
cumulative impact of health-related behaviours over time that 
are associated with chronic conditions to which most deaths are 
attributable. Depression is associated with poor quality of diet, 
infrequent exercise, smoking and excessive alcohol use.36–38 It has 
also been suggested that depression may be associated with 
physiologic changes to the cardiovascular system that directly 
affect risk of cardiovascular mortality.39

Changes in health-related behaviours associated with depres-
sion may also have contributed to the sex differences observed. 
For example, smoking and alcohol abuse have been, historically, 
more prevalent among men.40 Although smoking rates have 
decreased in the general population, the sex difference in smok-
ing has decreased by virtue of an increase among women. Con-
temporaneously, smoking has become more strongly linked with 
depression.41 That said, adjustment for smoking and alcohol 
abuse in the present study did not explain the elevated mortality 
risk among individuals with depression.
Secular trends observed in the Stirling County Study concern-
ing the emergence of an increased mortality risk associated with 
depression among women correspond to a time period of major 
changes in women’s employment and economic circumstances. 
By 1990, the gap between women’s and men’s participation in the 
labour force that had existed at the beginning of the study period 
had narrowed considerably.42 The changing roles of women in and 
outside of the home may have been a contributor to the increasing 
mortality burden of depression among working-age women, as 
they carried the responsibility for multiple roles.
Thus, despite reductions in stigma associated with depres-
sion and the wider availability and effectiveness of depression 
treatments, the association between depression and mortality 
has persisted over time —  and appears to have increased among 
women. Many depressed persons do not receive treatment for 
their condition. Insofar as treatment is received, it is provided 
mainly by general physicians. This suggests that providers of pri-
mary care give close attention to signs of mood disturbance 
among their patients and be particularly vigilant for recurrent 
depressive episodes.

*These analyses combine person-time contributed from all 3 Stirling County Study samples together, thereby allowing for robust estimation of secular trends. Using data from the 
follow-up interviews allowed us to shorten considerably the time from last assessment of depression status: 64% of the combined sample had their depression status assessed less 
than 20 years ago compared with 21% when only depression at baseline was considered.

Limitations
Unobserved heterogeneity tends to produce estimated hazard 
functions that decline with time even when the true hazard 
remains constant.37 Thus, hazard ratios from survival models with 
long follow-up times are likely to be biased downward. Survivor 
bias in the later years of follow-up can also mask underlying asso-
ciations between depression and mortality. Our estimates of the 
mortality burden of depression may therefore be conservative. 
This study was not able to control for some factors that are poten-
tially relevant in the association between depression and mortal-
ity, such as cognitive decline (which was measured only among 
older adults in the study), chronic conditions and physical disabil-
ity. Although participant retention exceeded 80% throughout the 
course of the study, misclassification of depression status in 1970 
and 1992 of participants enrolled earlier in the study but not re-
interviewed could have introduced bias. As a result, our analyses 
may overstate the decay in mortality risk associated with depres-
sion over long periods of time. Finally, the relatively long time 
between interviews did not allow us to track the effect of depres-
sion on mortality in greater detail — for example, yearly. More fre-
quent interviews would increase the accuracy of the obtained haz-
ard ratios and evaluate more precisely the duration over which the 
effect of depression on mortality persists. 
Finally, incompleteness of the mortality linkage conducted by 
Statistics Canada could have biased the results. Study partici-
pants who died but did not have a death certificate recorded in a 
provincial registry were therefore analyzed as alive. However, the 
projected number of deaths through 2011 generated by applying 
the provincial mortality rates to the age and sex distribution of 
the sample in 1993 (n = 988) was very close to the number of par-
ticipants linked to a death certificate (n = 1014).
Conclusion
The association between depression and mortality persists over 
long periods of time. The association was strongest for current 
depression, which tended to weaken within an individual over 
time unless there was a recurrent episode. The important impli-
cation of this finding, which needs to be pursued further, is 
whether remission from depression (either spontaneously or due 
to treatment) can reverse the elevated risk of mortality otherwise 
associated with depression.
