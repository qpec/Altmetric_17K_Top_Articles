Purpose
Despite documented oncologic benefit, use of postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy (aRT) in patients
with prostate cancer is still limited in the United States. We aimed to develop and internally validate
a risk-stratification tool incorporating the Decipher score, along with routinely available clinico-
pathologic features, to identify patients who would benefit the most from aRT.
Patient and Methods
Our cohort included 512 patients with prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy at one of
four US academic centers between 1990 and 2010. All patients had $ pT3a disease, positive
surgical margins, and/or pathologic lymph node invasion. Multivariable Cox regression analysis
tested the relationship between available predictors (including Decipher score) and clinical re-
currence (CR), which were then used to develop a novel risk-stratification tool. Our study adhered to
the Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis
guidelines for development of prognostic models.
Results
Overall, 21.9% of patients received aRT. Median follow-up in censored patients was 8.3 years. The
10-year CR rate was 4.9% vs. 17.4% in patients treated with aRT versus initial observation
(P , .001). Pathologic T3b/T4 stage, Gleason score 8-10, lymph node invasion, and Decipher score . 0.6
were independent predictors of CR (all P , .01). The cumulative number of risk factors was 0, 1, 2,
and 3 to 4 in 46.5%, 28.9%, 17.2%, and 7.4% of patients, respectively. aRT was associated with
decreased CR rate in patients with two or more risk factors (10-year CR rate 10.1% in aRT v 42.1% in
initial observation; P = .012), but not in those with fewer than two risk factors (P = .18).
Conclusion
Using the new model to indicate aRT might reduce overtreatment, decrease unnecessary adverse
effects, and reduce risk of CR in the subset of patients (approximately 25% of all patients with
aggressive pathologic disease in our cohort) who benefit from this therapy.

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common non-
cutaneous malignancy and the second most com-
mon cause of cancer-specific mortality in North
American men. Despite widespread prostate-specific
antigen (PSA) screening and the consequent stage
migration,1 up to 40% of contemporary men un-
dergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) may harbor
aggressive disease at pathology,2,3 These men are at
the highest risk of recurrence and would benefit
from postoperative radiation therapy (RT) with or
without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).4
Three randomized clinical trials from North
America and Europe showed better oncologic
outcomes in men treated with adjuvant RT (aRT)
when harboring adverse pathologic characteris-
tics at surgery.5-7 However, the use of aRT in
contemporary American patients remains limited

 at best (approximately 10% to 12%).8,9 This might be due to the
concern of overtreatment, because up to 40% of patients in the
control arms of these trials remained disease free.5-7 Moreover, the
beneficial impact of aRTon oncologic outcomes is accompanied by
an important risk of compromising functional outcomes after
surgery.10 As such, there is a critical need to identify patients who
are most likely to accrue curative benefit from aRT. In this context,
genomic tests such as the Decipher (GenomeDx Biosciences,
Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) have recently shown
promising results in prognosticating 5- and 10-year metastases
rates after RP,11-18 with Den et al13 reporting on the ability of the
Decipher score to potentially identify men likely to benefit from
adjuvant versus salvage RT. However, comparative outcomes for
men who did not develop biochemical recurrence or received aRT
after surgery (which might be the case in a substantial proportion
of men with aggressive disease5-7) were not reported in the Den
et al13 study. Additionally, although the reported outcomes were
stratified based on Decipher score (, 0.4 v $0.4),13 pathologic
tumor characteristics were not taken into account. The number
and nature of these characteristics are considered a good indicator
of who would benefit from aRT.19
To address these limitations, we combined genomic data
(ie, the Decipher score) and pathologic tumor characteristics to
identify patients who would derive the most oncologic benefit from
aRT versus initial observation (with or without subsequent salvage
RT). We adhered to the Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable
Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD)
guidelines for development and internal validation of a prognostic
model during the conduct of the study.20
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patient Cohort
We focused on a total of 512 patients with PCa treated with RP
between 1990 and 2010 at one of four academic institutions: Mayo Clinic
(n = 141), Durham Veterans Affairs (n = 104), Johns Hopkins Medical
Institution (n = 141), and Thomas Jefferson University (n = 126).12,15,17,21
All patients had at least one adverse pathologic feature at the time of
surgery (ie, $ pT3a stage, positive surgical margins [PSMs], and/or lymph
node invasion [LNI]) and reached undetectable PSA levels after surgery.
Postoperatively, these individuals received either aRTor initial observation
(with salvage RT [sRT] offered in case of biochemical recurrence).
Details of inclusion and exclusion criteria are reported in Figure 1.
Patient tumors (ie, RP specimens) were collected under institutional re-
view board-approved studies of the Decipher test and data were stored in
the GenomeDx PCa Genomic Resource Information Database.
Specimen Collection and Handling

 development of the Decipher genomic classifier. The study adheres to the
Reporting Recommendations for Tumor Marker Prognostic Studies cri-
teria for evaluation of prognostic biomarkers.24
Calculation of Genomic Risk of Metastasis
Genomic risk of metastasis was calculated with the Decipher test,
which has been validated as an independent predictor of clinical metastatic
progression after RP in different studies across multiple cohorts.11-18 The
Decipher score was calculated from RP specimens. The expression values
for the 22 prespecified biomarkers that constitute Decipher were extracted
from the normalized data matrix and entered into the locked random
forest algorithm with tuning and weighting parameters defined as reported
previously.13,14 The Decipher read-out is a continuous risk score between
0 and 1, with higher scores indicating a greater probability of metastasis at
5 and 10 years after RP.14,16,17 The Decipher score was also categorized into
low, intermediate, and high risk (, 0.45, 0.45 to 0.6, and . 0.6, re-
spectively) based on previously reported methodology.17,21
Clinicopathologic Variables
Key preoperative variables of interest were age (in years) at RP and
preoperative PSA level; postoperatively, the pathologic variables included
pathologic Gleason score, stage, PSM status, and LNI status. aRT was
defined as receiving radiotherapy within 12 months from RP, with
postoperative PSA levels of , 0.2 ng/mL. Similar conditions were used to
identify adjuvant ADT. Patients who did not receive any adjuvant treatment
after surgery were categorized as the initial observation group. Salvage
treatments were identified as receiving RT and/or ADT after documented
biochemical recurrence (PSA levels $ 0.2 ng/mL confirmed on two
separate occasions), or RTand/or ADTadministered $ 12 months after RP.
Outcome Definition
The primary end point of the study was time to clinical recurrence
(CR; as documented from prostatic fossa biopsy specimen, and/or ra-
diographically on computed tomography scan, bone scan, and/or other
imaging modalities). Follow-up time was calculated from time of surgery
to time of CR, or time of last available contact. Patients who died before CR
were considered to be censored. Of note, GenomeDx Biosciences staff and
personnel were blinded to the CR status during the laboratory processing
and calculation of Decipher for all patients in the study.
Statistical Analyses
Frequencies and proportions were reported for categorical variables,
whereas median and interquartile ranges (IQRs) were reported for con-
tinuous variables. Differences in categorical and continuous variables were
examined using the Fisher exact test and analysis of variance F test, re-
spectively. The median follow-up time was reported only for censored
patients25 and was determined by considering time of surgery and time to
last available contact. The Gray test was used to compare cumulative
incidence curves.26
Our statistical analyses consisted of two main steps. First, univariable
and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to test the
relationship between pathologic features/genomic feature (namely, the
Decipher score) and CR after surgery. The predictors for the models were
chosen a priori to performing the analyses. To account for the small
number of events, the results of the multivariable models were confirmed
using the Firth penalized likelihood method,27 which showed no sub-
stantive change in hazard ratios or P values, and ensured robustness of the
analyses. The coefficients of independent predictors from the multivariable
model were used to develop a novel nomogram predicting individual
probabilities of CR-free survival 5 and 10 years after RP. The discriminant
accuracy of the novel nomogram was quantified using time-dependent
concordance index (constructed using the nearest neighbor estimator with
a span parameter of 0.001 as described by Heagerty et al28) and adjusted for
optimism using bootstrapping with 1,000 resamples. Calibration plots
assessed the overall extent of over- or underestimation of CR rates
compared with nomogram-predicted probability of CR, and calibration
was tested using the D’Agostino-Nam29 version of the Hosmer-Lemeshow
test for survival data obtained from bootstrapped resamples.
Second, all independent predictors of CR from the aforementioned
multivariable model were assigned a score of 1 and summed to generate
a novel risk score. Next, cumulative incidence curves, stratified according
to the novel risk score, were used to depict CR-rate estimates in men
treated with aRT versus initial observation after surgery. Estimation of the
number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one episode of CR was cal-
culated using the method described by Altman and Anderson.30
The accompanying checklist highlights the adherence to the TRIPOD
statement guidelines (Appendix Table A1, online only). All statistical tests
were two-sided and analyses were performed in R version 3.1 (R Foun-
dation, Vienna, Austria).
RESULTS
Overall, median age (IQR) was 61 years (57 to 65 years). Pathologic
Gleason score was $ 4+3 in 48.4% of patients, and the majority
(72.3%) harbored extraprostatic disease (Table 1). Only 112
(21.9%) of patients received aRT. These men harbored PSMs more
frequently (85.7% v 62.0%) and were less likely to have LNI (0.9%
v 10.8%) compared with men managed with initial observation
(both P , .001). In the initial observation group, 168 patients
(42%) in the initial observation group received sRT at a median
(IQR) preradiotherapy PSA level of 0.55 ng/mL (0.33 to 1.40 ng/
mL). The median (IQR) time from RP to sRTwas 11.1 months (4.9
to 30.8 months).
Overall, 62 patients (12.1%) had documented CR through the
study period. Median (IQR) follow-up among those who did not
experience CR during the study period was 8.3 years (5.4 to 11.3
years). The 10-year cumulative incidence of CR was 4.9% (95% CI,
0.0% to 9.6%) in aRT patients versus 17.4% (95% CI, 12.7% to
21.9%) in initial observation patients (P , .001). In multivariable
analysis, pathologic pT3b/T4 disease (hazard ratio [HR], 3.63),
pathologic Gleason score 8 to 10 (HR, 3.36), presence of LNI (HR,
2.26), and high (v low) Decipher score (HR, 2.93) were all in-
dependent predictors of higher risk of CR (all P #.02; Table 2). Of
note, patients treated with aRT had a 66% lower CR risk than their
counterparts treated with initial observation (HR, 0.34; 95% CI,
0.11 to 0.82; P = .01). The coefficients of these independent
predictors were used to develop a novel nomogram stratified by
aRT status (Fig 2). Noteworthy, the Decipher score was used as
a continuous variable in the nomogram (HR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.09 to
1.44]; P = .002; Appendix Table A2, online only). The discrimi-
nation accuracy of the novel nomogram for predicting 5-year CR
risk was 85% (v 79% for the clinicopathologic model only, al-
though the 95% CI of the C indices for the two models overlapped)
and its calibration characteristics were favorable (Hosmer-
Lemeshow P = .1; Appendix Fig A1, online only).
In addition to the nomogram, a simple risk score was cal-
culated for all patients in our cohort on the basis of multivariable
analysis results. Specifically, the novel risk score represented the
cumulative number of independent predictors of CR found in each
patient (ie, pT3b/T4, pathologic Gleason score 8 to 10, LNI, and
high Decipher score). The risk score was 0, 1, 2, and 3 to 4 in 238
(46.5%), 148 (28.9%), 88 (17.2%), and 38 (7.4%) of patients,

 respectively. Figure 3 shows the cumulative incidence of CR in our
cohort after stratifying patients according to the novel risk score.
At 10 years, the CR rate was 5.6%, 12.4%, 27.3%, and 57.4% in
patients with risk scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3 to 4, respectively
(P , .001). In patients treated with aRT versus initial observation,

 score , 2 (P = .18; Fig 4A), and 10.1% versus 42.1% in patients
with a risk score $ 2 (P = .012; Fig 4B). At 10 years, NNT to
prevent one CR was 3.1 (95% CI, 2.9 to 3.3) in patients with risk
score $ 2.
Last, given that only one patient with LNI received aRT in our
cohort, we conducted post hoc sensitivity analyses after excluding
all men with LNI (Appendix). Independent risk factors for CR were
pathologic stage pT3b/T4 (HR, 2.65,), pathologic Gleason score 8
to 10 (HR, 3.85), and high Decipher score (HR, 2.90; all P #.04).
For patients treated with aRT versus initial observation, the 10-year
CR rate was 3.5% versus 9.6% in patients with a risk score , 2
(P = .21), and 10.6% versus 37.2% in patients with a risk score $ 2
(P = .04).
DISCUSSION
Despite level I evidence data demonstrating the favorable impact of
aRTon cancer control outcomes in patients with PCa with adverse
pathologic characteristics at surgery,5-7 the use of this treatment
modality is still very limited across the United States (approximately
10% to 12%).8,9 This might be attributed to many reasons, such as
concerns about overtreatment, radiation toxicity,5-7 adverse impact of
radiation on post-RP functional outcomes,10 and patient prefer-
ences.31 As a result, many physicians prefer an approach of initial
observation with or without sRTat biochemical recurrence. However,
the efficacy of the latter treatment modality has not been demon-
strated. One approach to overcome this clinical dilemma might be
a better definition of patients who actually need aRT. In this study, we
combined genomic data (ie, the Decipher risk score) and histopa-
thology data to identify the optimal candidate for aRT after surgery
among patients with PCa with adverse pathologic characteristics.8,9
Our analyses showed several important findings. First, we
demonstrate that incorporating Decipher added incremental
prognostic value in identifying patients with adverse pathologic
features (ie, extraprostatic disease, pathologic Gleason score 8 to
10, or presence of LNI) at a higher risk of CR after RP, with
a predictive accuracy of 85%. Based on the combined clinico-
pathologic and genomic parameters, we created a novel nomogram
to quantify the likelihood of CR-free survival 5 and 10 years after

Fig 2. Nomogram predicting the probability of clinical recurrence-free survival (CRFS) in patients with prostate cancer with adverse pathologic features at radical
prostatectomy on the basis of pathologic stage, pathologic Gleason score, lymph node invasion, and Decipher score. Nomogram outcomes were stratified based on
adjuvant radiotherapy (aRT) status. For example, locate the patient’s Decipher score on the Decipher axis. Draw a line straight up to the point axis to determine how many
points toward the probability of CRFS the patient receives for his Decipher score. Repeat the process for each additional variable. Sum the points for each predictor. Locate
the final sum on the total-point axis. Draw a line straight down to find the patient’s 5- and 10-year probability of CRFS. CR, clinical recurrence.

 RP (stratified by receipt of aRT), which showed optimal dis-
crimination and calibration characteristics. Whereas prior studies
have combined Decipher with pre-existing validated models (such
as the postsurgical Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment
[CAPRA-S] or the Stephenson nomogram),11,13 our study
attempted to incorporate genomic features with routinely available
clinicopathologic parameters to create a de novo prediction model.
This was then used to derive an easily used risk score. Importantly,
every one-point increment in the risk score was associated with
a doubling of CR risk at 10 years post-RP. Of note, this study is
based on genomic parameters that adhere to the recently published
TRIPOD guidelines for developing and reporting prognostic
models.20 Adherence to the guidelines increases the methodo-
logical strengths of our study and allows readers to transparently
assess the risk of bias and potential usefulness in a given clinical
setting. Our work represents a type 1b study per the TRIPOD
statement (corresponding to development and internal validation)
and lays the foundation for future external validation studies.
Second, our results provide vital information to guide de-
cision making regarding aRT in patients with aggressive pathology.
aRT use did not substantially alter the nomogram-predicted CR-
free survival in patients with few pathologic risk factors and low
Decipher score (ie, risk score , 2), allowing a substantial pro-
portion of patients to safely omit unnecessary aRT. Conversely,
those with more aggressive disease and higher Decipher scores (ie,
risk score $ 2) demonstrated greater benefit with upfront aRT
versus initial observation. Indeed, for patients in the latter group at
5 and 10 years post-RP, the absolute reduction in risk of CR was
17.3% and 32.0%, respectively (corresponding to a relative risk
reduction of 63% and 76%, respectively). At 10 years, the NNT to
prevent one CR in patients with risk score $ 2 was 3.1; the
corresponding NNT on the basis of current recommendations
(derived from the European Organization for Research and
Treatment of Cancer trial 22911 and the Southwest Oncology
Group 8794 trials) would be approximately 10. Although the risk-
scoring system has practical use in a busy clinical setting for patient

 counseling regarding the need for aRT, our nomogram can
provide individualized estimation of CR risk (both at 5 and
10 years post-RP) in men who opt for aRT and those preferring
an initial observation approach. Given the fairly protracted natural
history of PCa, 10-year CR estimates may arguably provide greater
clinical use to Decipher-based models. This, in turn, may enhance
shared decision making between urologists and their patients.
Pending the results of the RADICALS (Radiotherapy and An-
drogen Deprivation in Combination after Local Surgery),32
GETUG-17/070233 and RAVES (Radiotherapy–Adjuvant Ver-
sus Early Salvage) 34 trials comparing aRT with initial obser-
vation with or without salvage RT, our results suggest it might
not be prudent to withhold aRT in favor of an initial observation
approach patients with risk score $ 2.
Last, our results corroborate the findings reported by Den
et al,13 who suggested that aRT may offer significantly greater CR-
free survival than salvage RT in men with high Decipher score
($ 0.4), but not in men with lower Decipher scores. Nonetheless, there
are key differences as well. Most importantly, the control group (ie,
sRT) in the Den et al13 study excluded men treated with initial
observation: Given that 35% to 40% of patients treated with initial
observation may not experience a biochemical recurrence5,7 within
10 years of RP (thereby obviating the need for salvage therapy),
inclusion of such patients is necessary in deriving conclusions
regarding the oncologic efficacy for aRT.35 Of note, the median
time to sRT was 11.1 months in our cohort (compared with
5 months in the Den et al13 study), more closely reflecting the
natural history of an initial observation versus an upfront aRT
approach in the post-RP setting. Next, the C index of the Decipher-
only model in our study was somewhat lower compared with that
reported by Den et al.13 As alluded to earlier, this could be due to
different patient populations in the initial observation arm (with or
without sRT), and although direct comparison of aRT with only
salvage RTmay improve the discrimination power from a statistical
standpoint, it may not be truly reflective of a clinical setting. Fi-
nally, risk stratification of patients into those likely to benefit from
upfront aRT versus those who may not was based solely on low
versus intermediate/high Decipher score in the Den et al study.13
We have previously shown the prognostic role of histopathologic
features (ie, pathologic stage, Gleason score, and presence of LNI)
in predicting cancer-specific mortality in patients undergoing
aRT.19 As such, our current study shows that incorporating both
Decipher and clinicopathologic feature results in a better accuracy
when predicting CR after surgery.
Our study must be interpreted in light of its limitations. First,
this retrospective study spanned patients diagnosed and treated
over two decades (1990 to 2010); the widespread dissemination of
PSA screening leading to downstaging of PCa, evolution of aRTor
adjuvant ADT protocols, and modifications in the Gleason grading
system over the study period may be meaningful confounders of

 results. These data originated at four high-volume academic
centers and, as such, would require validation at the com-
munity level with both low- and high-volume facilities. The
median RT dose was 66.6 Gy, which, although somewhat lower
by contemporary standards, is comparable to what has been
reported in the three large-scale randomized controlled trials
on aRT (60 to 64 Gy).5-7 Second, although we accounted for the
use of adjuvant ADT, its use was largely driven by surgeon and/
or institutional preferences. There continues to be a lack of
consensus regarding the role of ADT in the adjuvant set-
ting,36-38 and the role of aRT with or without ADT, especially
in patients with pN1 disease, is currently a matter of investi-
gation.39 Third, a central pathologic review was not undertaken;
however, dedicated genitourinary pathologists at each center ex-
amined the histopathology specimens, which may reduce but not
entirely eliminate the possibility of interobserver and/or mis-
classification bias. Fourth, we did not see a statistically significant
association between PSM and CR rate: Although it is conceivable
that relatively fewer patients precluded this finding, evidence re-
garding association of PSM with metastases-free survival is rather
contradictory, even in level I studies.5-7

 Appendix
Given the retrospective nature of the study, a formal sample-size calculation was not performed. A complete-case analytic
approach was used; 11 patients were excluded from the study because of missing clinical or outcomes data.
Five-Year Cumulative Incidence of Patients With Clinical Recurrence Undergoing Initial Observation Versus Upfront
Adjuvant Radiotherapy
Primary analyses. The 5-year cumulative incidence of clinical recurrence (CR) was 2.0% (95% CI, 0.0% to 4.7%) in patients
who received adjuvant radiotherapy (aRT) versus 9.1% (95% CI, 6.2% to 12.0%) in initial observation patients. At 5 years, the CR
rates were 0.9%, 4.3%, 14.9%, and 45.4% in patients with risk scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3-4, respectively. The 5-year CR rate was 0.0%
versus 2.8% in patients with a risk score , 2 (P = .18; Fig 4A), whereas in patients with a risk score $ 2, the 5-year CR rate was
10.1% v 27.4% (P = .012; Fig 4B).
Post hoc analyses (excluding all men with lymph node invasion). At 5 years, the CR rates were 0.9%, 4.5%, 15.6%, and 42.9% in
patients with risk scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The 5-year CR rate was 0.0% v 2.9% in patients with a risk score , 2 (P = .2),
and 10.6% v 21.9% in patients with a risk score $ 2 (P = .04).
Results of Sensitivity Analyses After Excluding All Men With Lymph Node Invasion on Pathology
Independent risk factors for CR were pathologic stage pT3b/T4 (hazard ratio [HR], 2.65), pathologic Gleason score 8 to 10
(HR, 3.85) and high Decipher score (HR, 2.90; all P , .04). Patients treated with aRT had a 68% lower CR risk than their
counterparts treated with initial observation (P = .009). The predictive accuracy of the model was 82% (v 77% and 74% for the
clinicopathologic and Decipher-only models, respectively) and showed favorable calibration characteristics (data not shown). The
proportion of patients with risk scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3 was 238 (50.9%), 141 (30.1%), 77 (16.5%), and 12 (2.6%). At 10 years, the
CR rates were 5.6%, 13.1%, 29.6%, and 42.9% in patients with risk scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively (P , .001). In patients
treated with aRT versus initial observation, the 10-year CR rate was 3.5% v 9.6% in patients with a risk score , 2 (P = .2), and 10.6 v
37.2% in patients with a risk score $ 2 (P = .04).
