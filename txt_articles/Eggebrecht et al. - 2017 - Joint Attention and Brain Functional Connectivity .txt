 Abstract
Initiating joint attention (IJA), the behavioral instigation of coordinated focus of 2 people on an object, emerges over the first 2
years of life and supports social-communicative functioning related to the healthy development of aspects of language,
empathy, and theory of mind. Deficits in IJA provide strong early indicators for autism spectrum disorder, and therapies
targeting joint attention have shown tremendous promise. However, the brain systems underlying IJA in early childhood are
poorly understood, due in part to significant methodological challenges in imaging localized brain function that supports social
behaviors during the first 2 years of life. Herein, we show that the functional organization of the brain is intimately related to the
emergence of IJA using functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging and dimensional behavioral assessments in a large
semilongitudinal cohort of infants and toddlers. In particular, though functional connections spanning the brain are involved in
IJA, the strongest brain-behavior associations cluster within connections between a small subset of functional brain networks;
namely between the visual network and dorsal attention network and between the visual network and posterior cingulate
aspects of the default mode network. These observations mark the earliest known description of how functional brain systems
underlie a burgeoning fundamental social behavior, may help improve the design of targeted therapies for neurodevelopmental
disorders, and, more generally, elucidate physiological mechanisms essential to healthy social behavior development.

Introduction
The emergence of joint attention (JA), the coordinated orienting
of 2 people toward an object or event, occurs during the first 2
years of life, arguably the most dynamic and important period
of early child development (Scaife and Bruner 1975). It is theo-
rized that engaging in JA lays the foundation for prosocial
cooperative behavior, from basic social-communicative func-
tioning and language development (Premack 2004) to sophisti-
cated forms of empathy (Mundy and Jarrold 2010) and theory of
mind (Adolphs 2003). In fact, early exhibition of joint attention
is strongly associated with later language ability (Morales et al.
2000; Mundy et al. 2007), and atypical development of the initi-
ation of joint attention (IJA) is strongly indicative of autism
spectrum disorder (ASD) (Bruinsma et al. 2004). The neural sub-
strates underlying IJA in early childhood are poorly understood
(Barak and Feng 2016), due in part to significant methodological
challenges in imaging localized brain function that supports
social behaviors in children during the first 2 years of life.
Developmental trajectories, evident during the first 2 years of
life via directly observed behavior, physiology, or networks of
genetic transcription or brain function (Lin et al. 2008; Gao et al.
2009; Fransson et al. 2011; Smyser et al. 2011; Petersen and
Posner 2012; Toulmin et al. 2015), may illuminate underlying
mechanisms of normative function and may be predictive of
neurodevelopmental disorders (Tsodyks et al. 1999; Parikshak
et al. 2015; Richiardi et al. 2015). During early childhood, the
sequential emergence and consolidation of social behaviors (i.e.,
eye gaze following [Emery 2000], responding to a bid for joint
attention [RJA] [Scaife and Bruner 1975; Elison et al. 2013], initiat-
ing joint attention [Mundy et al. 2000]) exhibit a distinctive cas-
cading and phylogenetically preserved trajectory (Carpenter et al.
1998; Tomasello and Carpenter 2007; Okamoto-Barth et al. 2011),
with an infant’s capacity for IJA manifesting as a key ontogenetic
watershed (Tomasello et al. 2005). Recent studies in adults using
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have shown that
regions recruited in acts of both RJA and IJA are distributed
throughout
fronto-temporal-parietal
cortices
and
populate
social-cognitive, voluntary attention, orienting, and visual net-
works (Redcay et al. 2012; Caruana et al. 2015), as well as subcor-
tical
and
cingulate
areas
involved
in
reward
processing
(Schilbach et al. 2010; Pfeiffer et al. 2014; Oberwelland et al. 2016).
While some of this work incorporated a developmental sample
including school-aged participants (Oberwelland et al. 2016) and
participants with ASD (Redcay et al. 2013b), a key question is
how the emergence of IJA relates to the maturation of the brain’s
functional networks during typical and atypical early develop-
ment (Barak and Feng 2016; Chahrour et al. 2016). Because we
expect IJA behaviors to potentially serve different functions at
different ages, we do not necessarily expect to observe a down-
ward extension of the adult or school-aged participant findings
to infants and toddlers. Thus, we are taking a data-driven strat-
egy to test the brain-behavior relationships underlying IJA.
In the current study, we tested the extent of the relationship
between IJA and functional connections between brain networks
over the period of emergence and consolidation of IJA. We mea-
sured the frequency of spontaneous acts of IJA (Fig. 1A) by 12-
month-old (mo) infants and 24 mo toddlers using a semistruc-
tured dimensional behavioral assessment. Separately, we mea-
sured brain functional networks in the same group of infants
and toddlers using resting-state functional connectivity MRI
(fcMRI) (Power et al. 2011). We hypothesized that IJA would be
significantly correlated with a limited set of interactions between
functional brain regions, and that these associations would
change over time. To determine which functional networks sig-
nificantly contribute to the overall brain-behavior relationship,
we utilized an enrichment analysis adapted from research in
large-scale genetic association studies (Backes et al. 2014), a
novel strategy for analyzing neuro-behavioral relationships.
Materials and Methods
Participants
Participants were part of the Infant Brain Imaging Study, an
ongoing longitudinal study of infants at low- (LR) and high-
familial risk (HR) for ASD. Infants were recruited, screened,
and assessed at each of 4 sites: University of North Carolina,
University of Washington, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia,
and Washington University in St Louis. The research protocol
was approved by the institutional review board at all sites of
data acquisition for the study, and parents provided written
informed consent after receiving a detailed description of the

 study. Behavioral assessments and MRI data were acquired at
each site, and the data were used for research purposes only.
Inclusion Criteria
To maximize variance in a dimensional measure of IJA, we
enrolled children who were at HR for developing ASD as well as
children with LR (typically developing control participants) for
developing ASD. Children at high risk for developing ASD carry a
familial liability typically associated with behaviors, such as
impaired IJA, subthreshold to a full autism diagnosis, but distrib-
uted along a continuum. The HR infants were defined as having
at least one sibling with an ASD diagnosis, and LR infants had at
least one typically developing older sibling and did not have any
first- or second-degree family members with ASD or intellectual
disability. Participants were excluded for comorbid medical or
neurological diagnoses influencing growth, development, or cog-
nition; prior genetic conditions; premature birth or low birth
weight; maternal substance abuse during pregnancy; contraindi-
cation for MRI; or familial history of psychosis, schizophrenia, or
bipolar disorder (Wolff et al. 2012; Elison et al. 2013). All infants
and toddlers included in these analyses participated in a com-
prehensive battery of behavioral assessments and received an
Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS, Gotham et al.
2007) at 24 months. ADOSs and all other testing and interview
data were independently reviewed by experienced clinicians for
DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association 2000) criteria for
autistic disorder or pervasive developmental disorder not other-
wise specified. This paper includes data from infants who, at 24
months of age, did and did not meet criteria for ASD according
to research clinical best estimate using a DSM-IV-TR checklist.
The children with a positive diagnosis were included to extend
the range of observed IJA behavior at each age group. The age
groups did not differ by proportion of children later diagnosed
with ASD (Fisher’s exact test, P = 0.29).
Demographics
Two cohorts were defined: children were assessed at visits cor-
responding to 12- and 24-mo age groups (ranges: 11.7–14.5 mo
and 23.5–25.9 mo, respectively, Supplementary Table 1). All
data sets were subject to stringent fcMRI quality control criteria
and Infant Brain Imaging Study (IBIS) Network behavioral and
structural MRI inclusion criteria. Data sets passing all inclusion
criteria for both the Communication and Symbolic Behavioral
Scale (CSBS) and MRI include N = 116 at 12 and N = 98 at 24
months of age, with 37 individuals providing data at both time
points. Age groups did not significantly differ by proportion of
HR participants (P = 0.99), girls (P = 0.32), or IQ (Mullen compo-
site standard score, t = −0.92, df = 687, P = 0.18).
Assessment of IJA Behavior
IJA behavior was assessed at IBIS Network clinical sites with the
Communication and Symbolic Behavioral Scales-Developmental
Profile (CSBS-DP) (Wetherby et al. 2002), which is designed to eli-
cit social and communicative behaviors in infants and toddlers
between 12 and 24 months of age (Fig. 1B). The interaction
between examiner and infant is divided into 6 sampling oppor-
tunities: wind-up toy, balloon, bubbles, jar, books, and play,
with the complete assessment generally lasting up to 30 min.
The metric used for our study is calculated as the number of
sampling opportunities that included one or more acts of IJA,
defined as an act used to direct another’s attention to an object,
event, or topic of a communicative act (Wetherby et al. 2002):
“The child’s goal is to get the adult to look at or notice some-
thing,” (Question #7 of the CSBS). Acts for IJA are carefully dis-
tinguished
from
acts
used
for
behavioral
regulation
(e.g.,
requesting as action) and acts that are used to draw the adult’s
attention to the self (an act of social interaction but not expli-
citly IJA). Assessments are video recorded and scored by
research-reliable expert raters to ensure accuracy and intersite
and intrasite reliability across the IBIS network. There was
no effect of site on IJA scores (F = 0.97, P = 0.41), and age-in-
months was not correlated with IJA score within time point
(12 mo: ρ = 0.03, P = 0.46 and 24 mo: ρ = −0.02, P = 0.68).
Image Acquisition
All scans were acquired at IBIS Network clinical sites using iden-
tical
3-T
Siemens
TIM
Trio
scanners
(Siemens
Medical
Solutions)
equipped
with
standard
12-channel
head
coils.
Infants were naturally sleeping. The IBIS imaging protocol
includes T1-weighted (T1W) and T2W anatomical imaging, 25-
direction DTI and 65-direction HARDI DWI diffusion sequences,
and resting-state fcMRI (Wolff et al. 2012). This study made use
of the 3D sagittal T2W sequence (time echo [TE] = 497 ms, time
repetition [TR] = 3200 ms, matrix 256 × 256 × 160, 1 mm3 voxels).
Functional images were collected as a gradient-echo echo pla-
nar image (TE = 27 ms, TR = 2500 ms, voxel size 4 × 4 × 4 mm3,
flip angle 90°, field of view 256 mm, matrix 64 × 64, bandwidth
1906 Hz). All included infants provided at least 2 fMRI runs, each
run comprising 130 temporally contiguous frames (6.25 min).

 Conditioning Infants for MRI Scanning
A multistep conditioning approach was developed for acquiring
optimally reliable and successful MRI data in unsedated and
naturally sleeping infants and toddlers. First, parents were sent
a CD containing MRI sounds along with instructions to play the
CD at an increasingly loud volume every night at the infant’s
bedtime. The CD was played at home for 7–10 days. On the
night of the scan, a nonmagnetic crib and rocking chair were
placed in the scanner suite, and all lights in the room were
turned off. Child sized earplugs were placed in the infants’ ears
and secured with a piece of tape. If appropriate, infants were
also swaddled. The MRI CD was then streamed into the room
and played during the scanning session. The parent and the
infant followed their normal bedtime routine in the room, often
feeding the child and rocking them to sleep. Once the infant
fell naturally to sleep, the study team waited an additional
20 min before moving the infant to the MRI table. Babies, able
to be scanned prone, supine, or on their side, were placed on
the table in their most common sleeping position. Sandbags
were placed on the sides of the infant to help stabilize and pre-
vent rolling over. MRI compatible sound diminishing head-
phones were placed on the child, and the infant was allowed to
sleep for 20 more minutes to enter a deeper sleep before the
scan was initiated. Once the scan began, a research technician
stayed in the room, at the foot of the scanner to carefully moni-
tor the infant. If the baby awoke at any time, the scan was
immediately suspended and the process was reinitiated. When
feasible, MRI scan visits were scheduled in the evening as close
to the infant’s normal bedtime as possible and usually lasted
2–4 h. We did not track if participants arrived to the scanning
session awake or alternatively for how long they had been
asleep. The sleep stages of the participants while they were
undergoing their functional MRI scans may be more variable
than if all participants arrived awake.
fMRI Preprocessing
Initial fMRI data preprocessing followed previously described
procedures (Smyser et al. 2010; Pruett et al. 2015). These proce-
dures included 1) compensation for slice-dependent time shifts
using sinc interpolation, 2) correction of systematic odd–even
slice intensity differences caused by interleaved acquisition,
and 3) spatial realignment to compensate for head motion
within and across fMRI runs. The fMRI data were intensity
scaled (one multiplicative constant over all voxels and frames)
to obtain a whole brain mode value of 1000 (Ojemann et al.
1997). Such scaling facilitates the computation of variance mea-
sures for purposes of quality assessment but does not alter
computed correlations. Atlas registration of functional data was
achieved by a sequence of affine transforms (fMRI average vol-
ume—T2W—atlas-representative target). Age-specific (12 and 24
months) atlas-representative targets (Fonov et al. 2011) were
used to account for shape differences across developmental age
categories. Following fMRI—T2W—atlas transform composition,
the volumetric time series were resampled in atlas space
(3 mm3 voxels) including correction for head movement in a sin-
gle resampling step. Each atlas-transformed functional data set
was visually inspected in sagittal, transverse, and coronal views
to exclude potential errors not otherwise identified.
Frame Censoring
Head motion, even of submillimeter magnitude, has been identi-
fied as a nonphysiological source of spurious variance in resting-
state fMRI data (Power et al. 2012; Van Dijk et al. 2012;
Satterthwaite et al. 2013). Data were subjected to rigorous frame
censoring (“superscrubbing”) based on the frame-to-frame dis-
placement (FD) measure (Power et al. 2014), which sums 3 abso-
lute translations (X, Y, Z) and 3 absolute rotations (Pitch, Yaw,
Roll) evaluated at a radius of 50 mm. Frames with FD ≥0.2 mm
were marked for subsequent censoring. Temporally isolated (5 or
fewer contiguous) FD <0.2 mm frames were also censored. fMRI
runs with fewer than 30 uncensored frames were discarded. To
control for potential biases attributable to the amount of data
per cohort, 150 noncensored (retained) fMRI frames were used,
prioritizing runs with the most retained frames, for correlation
analysis in each subject.
fcMRI Preprocessing
Further preprocessing in preparation for computation of region-
of-interest (ROI) pair time series correlations followed previously
published procedures (Power et al. 2014). The data were centered
and detrended at every voxel within runs, ignoring censored
frames. The MRI tissue contrast properties in infants and tod-
dlers
make
automatic
segmentation
of
structural
images
extremely challenging (Hazlett et al. 2012). Following previously
published methodology (Pruett et al. 2015), we manually defined
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and white-matter regions in atlas-
transformed T1-weighted images from 15 representative partici-
pants in each age group (including data from both high- and
low-risk individuals). To reduce the risk of partial volume effects,
a 2.5-mm Gaussian kernel was used to erode these regions of
noninterest away from boundaries with other tissues including
gray matter. The final CSF and white-matter regions of noninter-
est were created by computing the intersection over each age
group. These regions were then used to extract nuisance regres-
sors for fcMRI processing. Nuisance waveforms then were
regressed voxelwise from the data, ignoring censored frames.
Nuisance regressors included 1) time series derived from 3 trans-
lation (X, Y, Z) and 3 rotation (Pitch, Yaw, Roll) estimates derived
by retrospective head motion analysis, together with Volterra
expansion derivatives (24 total motion regressors) (Friston et al.
1996) and 2) time series derived from the whole brain, white
matter, and CSF and their first derivatives. Following nuisance
regression, data in frames marked for censoring were replaced
by interpolated values computed by least-squares spectral ana-
lysis (Mathias et al. 2004; Power et al. 2014). The fMRI data were
then temporally filtered to retain frequencies in the 0.009 Hz <
f < 0.08 Hz band (Power et al. 2011). As a last step, the data were
spatially smoothed using a Gaussian kernel (6 mm full-width at
half-maximum [FWHM] isotropic). To test for a potential rela-
tionship between the resting-state motion parameters and the
IJA scores, we calculated the Spearman rank correlation between
the IJA scores and the mean and maximum of the FD (both
before and after frame censoring at FD = 0.2) for both age groups.
No significant relationship was observed (12 mo: mean FD before
scrubbing ρ = 0.02, P = 0.81; max FD before scrubbing ρ = 0.02, P =
0.86; mean FD after scrubbing ρ = 0.04, P = 0.66; max FD after
scrubbing ρ = 0.04, P = 0.70. 24 mo: mean FD before scrubbing ρ =
−0.03, P = 0.74; max FD before scrubbing ρ = 0.06, P = 0.52; mean
FD after scrubbing ρ = 0.06, P = 0.52; max FD after scrubbing ρ =
0.02, P = 0.83). The range of the number of clean frames of fcMRI
data passing the FD threshold of 0.2 was by age group: 12 mo—
min = 152, mean = 241.8, max = 375 and 24 mo—min = 152,
mean = 247.2, max = 375. Testing with a Spearman rank correl-
ation found no significant relationship observed in the amount
of frames passing the FD threshold and IJA score (12 mo: ρ = −0.5,

 P = 0.57 and 24 mo: ρ = −0.1, P = 0.89). In the end, all participants
contributed exactly 150 frames clean for analyses.
Definition of ROI and Functional Connectivity
Computation
ROIs (n = 280) were adopted from a combination of task data and
cortical functional areal parcellations (Cohen et al. 2008) obtained
in healthy adults (Power et al. 2011), and meta-analyses of autism
studies (Philip et al. 2012). Three viewers inspected ROI placements
in age-specific atlas templates. Of the 280 ROIs, 50 were partially
outside the whole brain mask or showed visible differences in
gray-matter coverage at different ages. These ROIs were removed
leaving 230 usable ROIs (Supplementary Fig. 1A, Supplementary
Spreadsheet 1) (Pruett et al. 2015). ROI-representative time series
were calculated as the average of the time series across all gray-
matter voxels contained by the 10-mm-diameter sphere located at
a given ROI center. Pairwise Pearson correlation values were gener-
ated for each of the 26 335 possible pairs of ROI and then Fisher-z
transformed.
Derivation of Putative Functional Networks in Infants
and Toddlers
A model for the organization of functional brain networks rep-
resentative of the infants and toddlers in the study was gener-
ated using a set of clean fcMRI data from 48 children acquired
at both the 12- and 24-month time points (Fig. 1C,D). Closely
following previous methods (Power et al. 2011), the full set of
ROI-pair correlations (Fisher-z values) were averaged across
subjects (Fig. 1C). The resulting average set of correlations were
thresholded and binarized at a variety of correlation thresholds
calculated to create connection matrices with specific degrees
of sparseness (ranging from 1% to 10% of all possible connec-
tions surviving the threshold, in steps of 0.01%). Connections
between ROI pairs separated by an Euclidean distance of
<20 mm were removed to minimize the effects of blurring in
the fMRI data. At each threshold, the resulting connection
matrices were evaluated using the Infomap algorithm (Rosvall
and Bergstrom 2008) that assigns ROIs to communities (subnet-
works) at each correlation threshold based on the maximiza-
tion of within-module random walks in the connection matrix.
Communities with 5 or fewer ROIs were designated “en masse”
as Unassigned (US). The solutions for each threshold were then
combined using an algorithmic “consensus” procedure that
combined Infomap solutions across edge density thresholds
by maximizing the normalized mutual information of groups
of neighboring solutions and maximizing the modularity of
the final consensus model. This provided a reasonable single
summary view of the functional networks of the brain. This
consensus model of the combined infant–toddler functional
network of the brain includes 13 putative networks with
naming informed by the adult set of networks: Vis (visual),
tDMN (temporal default mode network), pcDMN (posterior
cingulate DMN), aDMN (anterior DMN), SMN (somato-motor
network),
SMN2
(somato-motor
network
2),
DAN
(dorsal
attention network), pFPC (posterior frontal parietal control
network), aFPC (anterior frontal parietal control network),
SubCtx (subcortex), CO (cingulo-opercular), pCO (posterior
CO), and Sal (salience). To generate complementary analyses
using adult-functional networks, we adapted a previously
published model of adult-functional networks (Power et al.
2011) (Supplementary Fig. 1C).
Statistical Analysis
Demographic characteristics were recorded at visits correspond-
ing to the 12- and 24-mo time points (ranges: 11.7–14.5 mo and
23.5–25.9 mo, respectively). Potential group differences between
age groups in proportion of HR participants, proportion of chil-
dren later diagnosed with ASD and proportion of girls were
tested with Fisher’s exact test. Potential differences in intelli-
gence assessed via the Mullen Scales of Early Learning compos-
ite score were tested with Welch’s t-test. The potential effect of
site on IJA score was tested using a one-way ANOVA. To ensure
the subset of participants who contributed fcMRI data that
represent the larger sample, potential differences in the IJA
scores between these groups were tested with the Mann–
Whitney U test. The difference in IJA score across age was calcu-
lated across the larger sample of participants who contributed
behavioral data (n = 429 at 12 mo, n = 384 at 24 mo, and n = 311
with data at both time points) with the Wilcoxon signed-rank
test. The potential effect of age on IJA score within each age
group was tested with Spearman’s correlation.
To investigate the relationship between the fcMRI data and
the IJA metric for each age group, we first calculated the
Spearman rank correlation for each ROI-ROI fcMRI pair against
the IJA score across subjects (Fig. 2A). Second, methods for
enrichment analyses were adapted from those used in large-
scale genomic association studies (Rivals et al. 2007; Khatri
et al. 2012; Backes et al. 2014). Each network pair was tested for
enrichment of strong Spearman correlation values, defined as
values remaining after being thresholded and binarized at an
associated uncorrected P value ≤0.05 (Supplementary Fig. 2A).
Two complementary tests were conducted: a 1-degree-of-
freedom χ2 test and a hypergeometric test (Supplementary Fig.
2B,C). The χ2 test compares the observed number of strong
brain-behavior correlations within a functional network pair to
that which would be expected if the overall number of strong
correlations was uniformly distributed across all possible net-
work pairs. The statistic is large when the number of strong
correlations within a network pair is much less than (depletion)
or much greater than (enrichment) expected. Empirical P values
were calculated using randomization, as described below. The
hypergeometric statistic, as in Fisher’s exact test, assesses the
likelihood of observing a given number of strong correlations in
a network pair, given 1) the total number of strong correlations
observed overall and 2) the total number of possible hits for
that network pair (i.e., the total number or ROI pairs within a
given network pair). Both the χ2 test and the hypergeometric
tests had to pass the significance threshold for a given network
pair’s enrichment to be considered significant. Finally, we used
a McNemar χ2 test to investigate differences in brain-behavior
relationships between the ages of 12 mo and 24 mo. Within
each network pair, the McNemar statistic uses the number of
discordant tests (b = number of ROI pairs True at 12 mo but
False at 24 mo, c = the number of ROI pairs False at 12 mo but
True at 24 mo) between ages. The McNemar χ2 statistic is (b − c)2/
(b + c), if (b + c) > 25, and (|b − c| − 1)2/(b + c) otherwise.
Empirical significance levels were determined for the χ2,
hypergeometric, and McNemar tests using randomization. The
permutation test provides control over family-wise error rate, is
nonparametric, automatically adjusts to the degree of correl-
ation between tests, and does not make specific assumptions
about the shape of the population distribution from which the
observations have been derived (Backes et al. 2014). The permu-
tation respected the correlational and missing-data patterns in
the data (e.g., infants assessed at 12 months only). For each of

iterations,
permutations—wherein
complete
fcMRI
matrices were matched to a randomly swapped IJA score—were
performed separately for the 12-mo-only group, for the 24-
mo-only group, and for the set of data at both time points. The
groups were then recombined for analysis. Within each iter-
ation, asymptotic P values reflecting depletion were set to 1.
This was done to explicitly focus the statistical test on the pro-
bability of observing strong enrichment. Thus, the reported
brain-wide permutation-based false-positive rate of the P values
reflects
the
empirical
probability
of
calculating
the
actual
observed statistical value of enrichment at the 5% false-positive
rate level for the permutations. The permutation-based false-
positive-rate exhibited no correlation with the number of ROIs
within a network pair (Supplementary Fig. 2F,G). As an extra
troubleshooting step, we also tested the within-network-pair-
only false-positive rate to ensure no asymptotic P values showed
up in the randomizations more than 5% of the time. Within the
significantly enriched network pairs, to test whether this set of
strong correlations were significantly different from zero, a 2-
tailed t-test was performed. All anatomical MRI, fMRI, and fcMRI
preprocessing was carried out with the Washington University
in-house 4dfp-tools processing package (Pruett et al. 2015). All
analyses conducted and visualizations generated were executed
in MATLAB (Mathworks).
Results
This study focused on data collected in 116 infants and 98 tod-
dlers who contributed both behavioral and imaging data at 12
and/or 24 months, of whom 37 participants contributed data at
both time points (Supplementary Table 1). The 12 -mo infants
and 24-mo toddlers exhibited markedly different amounts of
spontaneous
IJA
behavior;
the
distribution
in
IJA
scores
reflected the emergence of IJA over the second year of life with
the expected large age-related increase in IJA (Wilcoxon signed-
rank test, z = −11.8, P < 3.4 × 10−32) (Fig. 1B). Thus, the relation-
ship to brain function was assessed within and across age.
We then measured intrinsic brain functional connectivity
using resting-state fcMRI in 12 mo infants and 24 mo toddlers
during unsedated natural sleep. Stringent data quality control
procedures minimized the presence of signal contamination due
to motion-induced artifacts and ensured at least 6.25 min of high-
quality MRI data. The distribution of IJA values in the participants
for whom we had fcMRI data was not significantly different from
that of a larger sample population (Mann–Whitney U test, 12 mo:
n = 429, z = 0.60, P = 0.55; 24 mo: n = 384, z = 1.2, P = 0.24). We
computed zero-lag Pearson correlation coefficients between 230
ROIs (Supplementary Fig. 1A) located throughout the cerebrum
and cerebellum and adapted from task data and cortical func-
tional parcellation studies in healthy adults (Power et al. 2011)
and meta-analyses of autism studies (Philip et al. 2012).
To facilitate analyses within each age group as well as across
age, we generated a cross-age network model using fcMRI data
sets from n = 48 participants contributing data at both the 12-
and 24-mo time points (inclusive of the 37 longitudinal subjects
with IJA data; Fig. 1C,D; Supplementary Fig. 1B). This model
enabled direct cross-age comparisons of brain-behavior relation-
ships. The naming of the functional subnetworks was adapted
from a previous study in healthy adults (Power et al. 2011). We
also performed the brain-behavior analyses using a published
adult network structure (see below; Supplementary Fig. 1C).
We tested the relationship between IJA and brain fc across
subjects by calculating the Spearman correlation between IJA
scores and fcMRI data for each of the 26 335 ROI pairs (Fig. 2A).
Individual brain-behavior correlations were of a moderate
magnitude; none passed Bonferroni correction for multiple
comparisons. However, stronger brain-behavior correlations of
matching sign generally clustered within functional network

across subjects for each ROI pair separately for each age group. (B) Strong positive (red) and negative (blue) Spearman correlations cluster within some network pairs.
(C) Quantifying the level of clustering with enrichment analyses (shown here are hypergeometric statistics, P values determined through randomization) reveals sig-
nificant grouping of brain-behavior associations constrained to a minority of network pairs (●). (D) Significant differences in brain-behavior associations between age
groups (McNemar χ2) were observed in a partially overlapping set of network pairs (●). (E) Only 2 functional network pairs significantly enriched at either age (
12 mo;
24 mo) also exhibit significant differences across age groups (

 pairs (e.g., the grouping of dark blue correlation values in the
Vis-DAN block at 12 mo; Fig. 2B). To quantify the level of clus-
tering of stronger brain-behavior correlations within specific
pairs of functional brain networks, we conducted the following
enrichment analyses. First, strong connections were defined as
ROI-pair brain-behavior correlations with uncorrected P ≤ 0.05
(Supplementary Fig. 2A). Next, 2 complementary metrics (a χ2
test and a hypergeometric test) were used to determine whether
the number of strong brain-behavior correlations within each
network pair was significantly greater than the number expected
if the strong connections were uniformly distributed throughout
the brain (Supplementary Fig. 2B,C). Empirical significance levels,
using a brain-wide false-positive rejection (FPR) rate of 0.05, were
determined using randomization (Supplementary Fig. 2D,E).
There was no relationship between the number of ROI pairs
within a network pair and the brain-wide FPR rate at 12 mo (n =
91, χ2, Pearson r = −0.15, P < 1.6 × 10−1; hypergeometric, r = −0.19,
P < 7.5 × 10−2; Supplementary Fig. 2F) or at 24 mo (χ2, r = −0.05,
P < 6.2 × 10−1; hypergeometric, r = −0.03, P < 7.8 × 10−1;
Supplementary Fig. 2G).
Functional network pairs containing a significant clustering of
strong brain-behavior correlations at 12 mo (Vis-pcDMN, hyper-
geometric brain-wide FPR P < 1.3 × 10−2; Vis-DAN, P < 5.4 × 10−3;
SMN2-aDMN, P < 7.5 × 10−3; SMN2-SMN, P < 1.9 × 10−2) did not
overlap with those observed at 24 mo (aFPC-DAN, P < 2.0 × 10−2;
aFPC-aFPC, P < 3.6 × 10−2; Sal-aDMN, P < 4.3 × 10−2; Fig. 2C).
Additionally, only 3 (of 91 total) functional network pairs exhib-
ited a significantly different set of brain-behavior relationships
between 12 mo and 24 mo (Fig. 2D, Vis-DAN, McNemar brain-
wide FPR P < 6.5 × 10−3; Vis-pcDMN, P < 2.2 × 10−2; tDMN-tDMN,
P < 5.0 × 10−2). Overall, the global set of brain-behavior relation-
ships at the ROI-pair level were different between the 2 age
groups (McNemar χ2 = 4.5, P < 1.7 × 10−2), partially driven by there
being nearly 8% more strong ROI-pair brain-behavior correlations
at 24 mo. From the systems-level perspective, although a differ-
ent and not-overlapping set of functional network pairs were
implicated at 12 mo and 24 mo, only 2 of 91 network pairs were
both significantly associated with IJA at a given age and signifi-
cantly different in their set of brain-behavior relationships across
age: Vis-DAN and Vis-pcDMN (Fig. 2E, Supplementary Table 2).
In contrast, while the other network pairs implicated at
12 mo were not significantly enriched at 24 mo (based on the χ2
and hypergeometric tests), they did not yield different enough
brain-behavior relationships to pass significance across age
(McNemar brain-wide FPR; SMN2-aDMN P < 1.1 × 10−1, SMN2-
SMN P < 2.1 × 10−1). This reflects a more subtle difference
wherein the contributions of the connections within the net-
work pairs to IJA become more muted over the second year of
life. Similarly, in those network pairs implicated at 24 mo but
neither significantly enriched at 12 mo nor different across age
(i.e., aFPC-DAN P < 1.5 × 10−1, aFPC-aFPC P < 2.0 × 10−1, Sal-
aDMN, P < 7.0 × 10−2), the relationships of the connections
within the network pairs to IJA become strengthened over the
second year of life. These discovery results (significant at one
age, but not statistically different from a nonsignificant result at
the other age) provide potential targets for future hypothesis-
driven longitudinal studies.
In 4 of the 7 significantly enriched infant–toddler functional
network pairs, general consistency was present in the signs of
the brain-behavior correlations (all at 12 mo, Figs 3 and 4),
whether or not the correlations were significantly positive (Vis-
pcDMN [t-test of sign vs. zero, t = 9.2, P < 3.5 × 10−11], SMN2-
aDMN [t = 9.2, P < 1.4 × 10−11]) or negative (Vis-DAN [t = −19.9,
P < 6.8 × 10−32] and SMN2-SMN [t = −9.7, P < 1.1 × 10−11]) (Fig. 4).
To explain: negative brain-behavior correlation involving 12 mo
Vis-DAN ROIs means that as the brain fc decreased, the fre-
quency of IJA increased. In contrast, positive brain-behavior
correlation between Vis-pcDMN means that as the brain fc
increased, the frequency of IJA also increased. Additionally,
within these networks, the sign of the fcMRI correlation values
themselves was also generally conserved across ROI pairs
(Fig. 4). For example, at 12 mo, strong positive brain-behavior
correlations were apparent in connections of ROIs between the
Vis-pcDMN (Fig. 3), and the fc between those ROIs was also gen-
erally positive (orange and yellow lines in Fig. 4). This means
that as the fc values increased from zero to strong and positive,
presumably reflecting a significant history of in-phase (coher-
ent) co-activation (Lewis et al. 2009), the frequency of IJA
increased.
This
finding
stood
in
contrast
to
connections
between the SMN2-aDMN where most ROI pairs displayed a
positive brain-behavior correlation over a negative range of fc
values (green lines in Fig. 4). In this case, a history of strong
antiphase co-activation (i.e., strong magnitude fc but negative
in sign) correlated with fewer acts of IJA.
These patterns were also detectable when using a brain func-
tional network structure derived from a previously published
independent fcMRI data set of typical adults (Power et al. 2011)
(Supplementary Figs 1C and 3). The adult-functional network
pairs displayed a qualitatively more heterogeneous set of brain-
behavior relationships than those obtained using the infant–tod-
dler networks (presumably, because our infant–toddler-derived
networks better reflect the developing brain’s functional archi-
tecture for these infant–toddler brain-behavior correlation ana-
lyses). Additionally, 4 of the 7 adult-functional network pairs
contain
significantly
different
brain-behavior
relationships
across age, including one enriched at 24 mo (VAN-DMN).
Discussion
Here, we show that IJA is intimately and differentially related
to the systems-level organization of the 12-mo and 24-mo
developing brain. In particular, we found that though func-
tional connections spanning the brain are involved in IJA, the
strongest brain-behavior associations are clustered within con-
nections between a small subset of functional brain networks.
We found different sets of implicated networks at each age,
with the strongest associations between visual and dorsal
attention networks and between the visual network and par-
ietal aspects of the default mode network at 12 months.
In general, a highly similar pattern emerges from both the
infant–toddler and adult network models: IJA is correlated with
brain fc between regions distributed throughout the cerebrum,
with the strongest brain-behavior correlations clustered into a
specific and small number of functional network pairs that are
different across the age groups. Previous foundational task-
based studies in infants using positron emission tomography
(PET) (Caplan et al. 1993) or electroencephalography (EEG)
(Mundy et al. 2000; Henderson et al. 2002), indicated that IJA
may be supported by prefrontal areas, while groundbreaking
studies in adults using novel fMRI and eye tracking paradigms
(Redcay et al. 2012; Caruana et al. 2015) implicated a distributed
set of regions throughout the prefrontal, temporal, and parietal
cortices. These regions reflect a broad integrated set of regions
that support the coordinated functioning of vision, attention, task
control,
and—along
with
subcortical
and
cingulate
regions
(Schilbach et al. 2010; Pfeiffer et al. 2014; Oberwelland et al. 2016)—
motivation and reward signals. The current study expands on
these observations with a brain-wide systems perspective utilizing

 fcMRI at time points within the period of emergence of IJA.
Because of near complete absence of extant data about brain-
behavior associations during this epoch of development, we
chose to use data-driven methods with the power to identify
unanticipated relationships between IJA and functional connect-
ivity. The current results reveal that specific network pairs exhi-
biting the strongest associations with IJA within age as well as
the strongest differences across age include the Vis-DAN and the
Vis-pcDMN in the 12-mo age group. At 24 mo, though 8% more
ROI pairs have strong correlations between fc and IJA, these
strong correlations are more distributed throughout the brain,
reflecting a different balance of brain function underlying the
complex behavior of IJA. The present findings of strong brain-
behavior relationships at either 12 mo or 24 mo (but not signifi-
cantly different across age) are discovery results to be used as
features for model generation for future studies.
These observed differences in functional network associa-
tions with increasing frequency of IJA across 12–24 months may
reflect changes in fc driven by social experience-dependent
learning that occurs over the second year of life (Tomasello et al.
2005; Canals et al. 2009; Lewis et al. 2009; Fransson et al. 2011)
and the unfolding, later transition from nonverbal to verbal com-
munication (Morales et al. 2000; Mundy et al. 2007; Kuhl 2010;
Igualada et al. 2015). Additionally, these observed varying brain-
behavior relationships may relate to the toddlers’ increasing
capacity to use multiple strategies to initiate joint attention.
Infants around 12 mo tend to use eye gaze shifts, pointing ges-
tures, or a simple vocalization. However, by 24 mo as IJA
becomes a more salient aspect of behavior, toddlers integrate
these communicative domains into an actionable unit, combin-
ing eye gaze shifts, pointing gestures, and vocalizations into a
single multifaceted gesture. This shift in behavioral strategies
may reflect maturation of connections between default mode
network regions, known to be involved in hetero-modal integra-
tion as well as processing of socially relevant stimuli and inter-
actions, with primary visual and sensory-motor regions along
with higher association areas distributed throughout the pre-
frontal and parietal cortex (Buckner et al. 2008; Fransson et al.
2011).
The ROIs used in the current study are well defined and
have been used in the literature in typical and autism-related
studies (Pruett et al. 2015), and offer a foundation for the cur-
rent analysis. One limitation is that the ROIs derive from work
in older subjects. In the future, the analyses described in this
paper may be extended to alternate ROIs such as infant and
toddler functional areal parcellations. There are significant
challenges, however, to generating these, and this idea consti-
tutes an exciting future direction.
Another limitation of the current study is that the fcMRI data
were acquired while the participants were naturally sleeping

 and sleep stage was not monitored with EEG polysomnography.
Potential differences in sleep stage may exist both within and
between the age groups, complicating interpretation of the
fcMRI data. Acquiring fMRI data during natural sleep provides
potential insight into a population that generally is challenging
to study (Dehaene-Lambertz et al. 2002; Redcay et al. 2007;
Graham et al. 2015; Pruett et al. 2015). Future studies using
combined fcMRI-EEG present exciting opportunities to better
interpret
brain
function
in
sleeping
infants
and
toddlers.
Alternatively, given that IJA is a fundamentally interactive com-
munication behavior, advances in wearable and minimally
invasive neuroimaging technology (Hassanpour et al. 2015;
Lloyd-Fox et al. 2015; Begus et al. 2016; Ferradal et al. 2016) may
facilitate further advancements in study designs that use awake
and
directly
interacting
participants
(Redcay
et
al.
2013a;
Oberwelland et al. 2016). An additional limitation of the study is
the potential for differences in brain-behavior relationships
between high- and low-risk groups both within and across age,
including the possibility that the network architecture under-
lying IJA may differ in children who develop ASD. However, our
study was not designed or powered to address these questions.
The underlying psychological and behavioral features of ASD
are continuously distributed in the population (e.g., Constantino
and Todd 2000; Constantino 2011; Constantino and Charman
2016). Infants with an older sibling with an ASD diagnosis (HR)
are >10× more likely to be diagnosed with the disorder than
infants without an older sibling or immediate relative with a
positive ASD diagnosis (LR). In addition, those HR infants who do
not develop autism will eventually show rates of >30% with other
traits subthreshold (for autism) psychopathology. As such, this
sample provided the range of behavior required to adequately
test the brain-IJA relationships that we report. Though the sam-
ple is too small to test for differences within age between risk or
diagnostic groups (Supplementary Table 1), this work sets the
stage for future studies comparing brain-behavior relationships
in larger age-specific, risk and outcome subgroups.
In summary, these observations offer a first glimpse into the
functional brain structure underlying the emergence and con-
solidation of IJA across the second year of life. These results
may inform clinical therapies by providing further physiological
Figure 4. The sign of the brain-behavior correlation between ROI pairs in implicated network pairs is highly consistent at 12 mo, but is more heterogeneous at 24 mo.
Each scatter plot reveals the proportion of fcMRI data that is positive for each brain-behavior correlation value separately for each of the implicated network pairs at
12 mo (A) and at 24 mo (B). The functional connectivity between ROI pairs with strong brain-behavior correlations tends to be contained within limited regimes of
both sign and magnitude. The color of the lines connecting pairs of ROIs reflects the proportion of individual fcMRI values that are above zero. Light blue to dark blue
to magenta colors reflect negative brain-behavior correlation and green to yellow to red colors denote positive brain-behavior correlation (ρ). Light blue and green
denote that the ROI pair contains only negative fcMRI values between the ROI pairs. Magenta and red reflect ROI pairs with only positive fcMRI. Blue and yellow reflect
fcMRI values distributed across zero. The black-dotted boxes signify that the Vis-DAN and Vis-pcDMN network pairs exhibit significantly different brain-behavior
relationships across age. Data are shown only for ROI pairs with a brain-behavior correlation ρ with an associated P ≤ 0.05.

 foundation for JA-based behavior interventions that have been
shown to significantly improve outcome in children with ASD
(Kasari et al. 2012; Chahrour et al. 2016). Important future direc-
tions include the examination of relationships between brain-
IJA correlations and those for specific behavioral and cognitive
domains of function suspected (or known) to be intimately
related to IJA at different points in development (Conboy et al.
2015; Igualada et al. 2015). Our methods would enable explora-
tions of potential overlap and nonoverlap of brain-behavior rela-
tionships for IJA and RJA (aspects of which are evolutionarily
conserved [Adolphs 2003]), language (Premack 2004), and Theory
of Mind (Adolphs 2003; Penn and Povinelli 2007; Krupenye et al.

experiments
could
characterize
the
brain-
behavior relationships for what may be “building blocks” of IJA-
specific motor processes (pointing, head turning, gaze shifting),
visuo-motor integration (pointing at what you are looking at),
and aspects of visual attention (selecting the target object in the
visual field). Additionally, studies utilizing dense longitudinal
designs could employ these methods, using brain data taken as
early as 6 months, to elucidate within-subject trajectories for
normal socio-cognitive maturation that may help differentiate
typical from atypical development.
