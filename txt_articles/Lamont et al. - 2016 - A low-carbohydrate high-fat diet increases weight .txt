A low-carbohydrate high-fat diet increases weight gain and
does not improve glucose tolerance, insulin secretion or β-cell
mass in NZO mice
BJ Lamont, MF Waters and S Andrikopoulos
BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Dietary guidelines for the past 20 years have recommended that dietary fat should be minimized.
In contrast, recent studies have suggested that there could be some potential benefits for reducing carbohydrate intake in favor of
increased fat. It has also been suggested that low-carbohydrate diets be recommended for people with type 2 diabetes. However,
whether such diets can improve glycemic control will likely depend on their ability to improve β-cell function, which has not been
studied. The objective of the study was to assess whether a low-carbohydrate and therefore high-fat diet (LCHFD) is beneficial for
improving the endogenous insulin secretory response to glucose in prediabetic New Zealand Obese (NZO) mice.
METHODS: NZO mice were maintained on either standard rodent chow or an LCHFD from 6 to 15 weeks of age. Body weight, food
intake and blood glucose were assessed weekly. Blood glucose and insulin levels were also assessed after fasting and re-feeding
and during an oral glucose tolerance test. The capacity of pancreatic β-cells to secrete insulin was assessed in vivo with an
intravenous glucose tolerance test. β-Cell mass was assessed in histological sections of pancreata collected at the end of the study.
RESULTS: In NZO mice, an LCHFD reduced plasma triglycerides (P=0.001) but increased weight gain (Po0.0001), adipose tissue mass
(P=0.0015), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P=0.044) and exacerbated glucose intolerance (P=0.013). Although fasting insulin levels
tended to be higher (P=0.08), insulin secretory function in LCHFD-fed mice was not improved (P=0.93) nor was β-cell mass (P=0.75).
CONCLUSIONS: An LCHFD is unlikely to be of benefit for preventing the decline in β-cell function associated with the progression
of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes.

INTRODUCTION
Low-carbohydrate high-fat diets (LCHFDs) have achieved weight
loss in several clinical studies,1–4 and others have described their
potential benefits in patients with diabetes.5–7 Reducing ingested
carbohydrates limits the potential for blood glucose levels
to increase following a meal.6,8 However, as the major contributors
to hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes include a resistance to insulin
action on target tissues, in combination with an inability
of pancreatic β-cells to secrete enough insulin,9 it is important
we further consider the impact that LCHFD could have on these
important aspects of metabolic regulation.
Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake into muscle and adipose
tissue is significantly improved by weight loss, such as that
achieved in some studies using LCHFDs.3,4 However, an LCHFD
does not necessarily result in weight reduction, and high dietary
fat in animal studies, regardless of effects on body weight, has
been shown to cause an increased accumulation of lipids in the
liver, which negatively affects insulin’s ability to reduce hepatic
glucose production.10–13 Therefore, the proposed benefits vs
potential negative effects of an LCHFD on blood glucose control
need to be seriously considered before such diets are regarded as
a useful option for diabetes management. Moreover, whether
LCHFDs will prove beneficial for improving glucose control in type
2 diabetes after long-term use will depend on their impact
on glucose-induced insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells,
which prior to this study has not been carefully examined.
Appropriate insulin secretion in response to changes in blood
glucose is essential for maintaining normoglycemia. In type 2
diabetes, insulin resistance places a greater demand on pancreatic
β-cells to secrete more insulin. If β-cell function is maintained at a
level that can compensate for insulin resistance, blood glucose is
maintained within the normal range. However, in susceptible
individuals, β-cells are unable to cope with the extra stresses
of increased metabolism and insulin production that are required.
In patients with diabetes, β-cell function is insufficient, and as it
continues to decline over time, blood glucose control becomes
progressively worse. In this setting, an increase in β-cell apoptosis
can also contribute to a loss of β-cell mass.14 It is clear that
diabetes therapies that do not address this decline in β-cell
function fail to maintain blood glucose control.15 Therefore, the
impacts of LCHFDs on β-cell function may determine whether
they could be a useful part of type 2 diabetes management.
A diet or therapy that reduces the workload of pancreatic β-cells
in the early stages of diabetes might be predicted to have
a beneficial effect for maintaining and perhaps preserving their
capacity to respond to increases in blood glucose. In contrast,
chronic hypersecretion of insulin has been associated with β-cell
failure.16 Of potential benefit, reducing dietary carbohydrate
reduces postmeal glucose excursions and the need for insulin
secretion.6,8 However, in healthy individuals an LCHFD can result
in an impaired response to an oral glucose tolerance.17 Animal
studies are able to shed further light on the potential impact

 of LCHFDs because they can control dietary and other influences
more tightly than clinical studies. HFDs, in combination with either
normal or high carbohydrate, have generally induced metabolic
impairments in rodents.10,18–22 Some studies in normal-weight
animals have also shown impairments in glucose tolerance and
a reduction in β-cell mass.10,18 In contrast, some improvements
in glucose homeostasis with an LCHFD were observed in leptin-
deficient ob/ob mice.23 However, none of these studies specifically
examined the effect of an LCHFD on β-cell function in an animal
model that is prone to diabetes. The New Zealand Obese (NZO)
mouse is a polygenic model of obesity, which develops early
in the progression of the disease owing to increased energy
intake, akin to human obesity.24 In NZO mice, which also display
glucose
intolerance,
impaired
β-cell
function
and
develop
diabetes from approximately 20 weeks of age, a HFD worsened
obesity and insulin resistance.25 Interestingly, in these mice, a
high-fat carbohydrate-free diet prevented hyperglycemia and
preserved β-cell mass.25 However, when carbohydrate-naive NZO
mice were later exposed to a diet containing carbohydrate (32%
of energy), they were highly susceptible and quickly developed
diabetes.26,27 In summary, a life-long completely carbohydrate-
free diet is unlikely to be achievable but an LCHFD, through
reducing postmeal glucose excursions, could potentially have
some benefit for improving glucose control in diabetes. Therefore,
we aimed to determine whether feeding prediabetic NZO mice an
LCHFD could positively affect β-cell function and mass. The results
presented herein demonstrate that, although postmeal glucose
excursions were reduced by an LCHFD, there were no longer-term
benefits for β-cell function or glucose metabolism.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animal diets and housing conditions
NZO mice were bred under specific-pathogen-free conditions in the
BioResources Facility at Austin Health (Heidelberg, VIC, Australia). After
weaning, male mice were housed in groups of 2–3 per cage and maintained
under standard laboratory conditions with controlled temperature (19–22 °C)
and 12-h light/dark cycle. All mice were fed ad libitum with free access to
clean drinking water throughout the duration of this study. Prior to the study,
all mice were fed a standard rodent maintenance diet. At 6 weeks of age,
mice were either transferred to an LCHFD or maintained on the standard diet
(chow) for a further 9 weeks. The LCHFD contained 24 MJ kg− 1 digestible
energy (3.1 MJ or 13% coming from protein, 1.5 MJ or 6% from carbohydrate
and 19.5 MJ or 81% from fat (Supplementary Table S1). The carbohydrate
content of the LCHFD was exclusively derived from simple sugar (sucrose:
106 g kg − 1). The fat content of this diet was derived from 55% saturated,
37% monounsaturated and 8% polyunsaturated fats, by weight. The chow
diet contained 13.5 MJ kg− 1 digestible energy, with 2.7 MJ or 20% coming
from protein, 9.5 MJ or 70% from carbohydrate and 1.4 MJ or 10% from
fat
(Supplementary
Table
S2).
Typically,
rodent
chow
carbohydrate
is contributed to by 50% starch and approximately 2% simple sugars
(monosaccharides plus disaccharides) as a proportion of total carbohydrates
by weight. The fat content of chow is typically 18% saturated, 37%
monounsaturated and 15.4% polyunsaturated fats. All animal procedures
were approved by the Austin Health Animal Ethics Committee.
Overview of animal experiments
Random-fed blood glucose (at ≈1400 hours), body weight and food intake
were measured weekly. Care was taken to account for all the food that was left
over and crumbled into the cage. After 6–7 weeks of the diet (at 12–13 weeks
of age), mice were fasted overnight and re-fed their respective diets so that
insulin and glucose levels could be assessed. Body weight and blood glucose
measurements were carried out prior to the removal of food from the cages at
1700 hours. The next day, following the overnight fast (16 h), body weight and
blood glucose measurements were repeated, and a 100-μl blood sample
was collected from the tail vein. Food was returned, and after 4 h of ad libitum
re-feeding, blood glucose was measured and another 100 μl of tail blood
was collected. After 7–8 weeks, an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was
performed as described below. After 9 weeks, an intravenous glucose
tolerance test (IVGTT) was performed. Immediately after the IVGTT, animals
were killed with a lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital and tissue samples
were excised.
Oral glucose tolerance test
The OGTT was performed in awake mice as previously described.20,28
After administering a standardized glucose dose (37.5 mg in a volume
of 150 μl) to all animals, blood glucose was measured at 0, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90
and 120 min, and blood samples were taken at 0, 10 and 30 min. After
centrifugation, plasma was stored at − 20 °C for future glucose and insulin
analyses.
Intravenous glucose tolerance test
The IVGTT was performed as previously described.21 Following the glucose
bolus (1 g kg − 1), blood samples were taken at 0, 2, 5, 10, 15 and 30 min.
Plasma was stored at − 20 °C for later glucose and insulin analyses.
Plasma glucose, insulin, triglyceride and cholesterol
measurements
A GM7 Analox glucose analyzer (Helena Laboratories, Mount Waverley, VIC,
Australia) was used to determine plasma glucose levels via a glucose
oxidase assay. Plasma insulin levels were determined using a Mouse Insulin
ELISA Kit (Alpco, Caringbah, NSW, Australia). Plasma triglyceride (TRO100)
and cholesterol (MAK043) levels were determined using the commercial
assay kits (Sigma-Aldrich, Castle Hill, NSW, Australia).
Tissue extraction and analysis
At the end of the 9-week study, following killing of mice, pancreata and
epididymal fat pads were rapidly excised and weighed. Pancreatic tissue
was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 48 h and stored in 70%
ethanol until further processing and embedding in paraffin. For assess-
ment of β-cell mass, pancreatic sections were immunostained for insulin
(using a guinea pig anti-insulin primary antibody, 1:100 dilution) as
previously described.29 Two sections (separated by 100 μm) from each
pancreas were analyzed. Slides were scanned using the ScanScope CS
system (Aperio Technologies, Vista, CA, USA) at × 40 magnification. Digital
images were analyzed with the ScanScope software (Aperio Technologies).
β-Cell mass was calculated as the product of pancreas weight before
fixation and the ratio of insulin positive/total pancreas cross-sectional area.
Statistical analysis
All data are presented as mean ± s.e.m. and Po0.05 was deemed
significant. GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software Inc, La Jolla, CA, USA)
was used for statistical analysis. Student’s t-tests were performed to
determine statistical significance between the LCHFD and chow groups.
When multiple t-tests were performed, the Holm–Sidak method was used
to correct for multiple comparisons. When data from repeated measures
were analyzed, for example, from weekly blood glucose/body weight
measurements or GTT curves, or fasting and re-fed conditions, two-way
analysis of variance performed and Sidak’s multiple comparison test was
used to analyse multiple comparisons between the two experimental
groups.
RESULTS
An LCHFD exacerbates obesity but reduces plasma triglycerides
The mean body weight of NZO mice assigned to either the LCHFD
(32.6 ± 1.1 g, n = 9) or standard chow diet (33.5 ± 1.2 g, n = 8) was
not different at the beginning of the study. After 3 weeks, mice fed
the LCHFD began to diverge from the chow-fed group, and at
5 weeks the difference in body weight was statistically significant
(Figure 1a). At the end of the study, white adipose tissue mass was
also significantly increased (Figure 1c). The LCHFD has a higher
energy density than the chow diet (24 vs 13.5 MJ kg − 1); however,
the increased body weight of mice fed the LCHFD was not
associated with a higher energy intake (Figure 1b).
Despite increased body weight and adipose tissue mass, NZO
mice fed an LCHFD displayed reduced plasma triglycerides at
the end of the 9-week study (Figure 2). Total cholesterol levels
tended to be slightly increased (P = 0.07) with an LCHFD, and this

 was mainly due to an increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
cholesterol (Figure 2), the predominant form of circulating
cholesterol in rodents.
Increased fasting blood glucose in NZO mice fed an LCHFD
An LCHFD did not affect random-fed blood glucose levels
measured weekly throughout the study (Figure 3a); however,
the mean blood glucose in the LCHFD group after an overnight
fast was significantly higher than that of the chow-fed mice
(Figure 3b). There was also a clear trend for higher fasting plasma
insulin levels in LCHFD-fed mice (Figure 3c). When mice were
given free access to their respective diets after an overnight fast,
re-fed blood glucose concentrations were significantly increased
following consumption of the carbohydrate-rich chow diet, but
they did not change, compared with fasting, in the LCHFD group
after feeding (Figure 3b). Therefore, compared with the chow
group, re-fed blood glucose in LCHFD-fed mice was approximately
2 mmol l − 1 lower. Fed plasma insulin levels in the LCHFD mice
were also significantly higher (Figure 3c), which is suggestive of
exacerbated insulin resistance and consistent with the increased
weight gain and adiposity observed in this group (Figure 1).
An LCHFD further impairs glucose metabolism in NZO mice
In this study, an LCHFD further exacerbated the impairments
in glucose metabolism that are characteristic of NZO mice.30,31
During an OGTT, blood glucose levels increased similarly in both
LCHFD and chow-fed NZO mice but remained significantly higher
throughout the remainder of the test in the LCHFD-fed mice
(Figures 4a and b). Although plasma insulin levels also tended
to be higher in the LCHFD fed mice (Figure 4c), this was clearly not
sufficient to overcome the insulin resistance in these mice.
To further investigate the ability of NZO mice to respond
to elevations in blood glucose, an IVGTT was performed. Following
an IV glucose bolus, blood glucose levels (Figure 5a) were
increased in both groups to levels (430 mmol l − 1) that are
expected to maximally stimulate insulin secretion from pancreatic
β-cells. Overall plasma glucose concentrations during the test
were higher in LCHFD-fed mice (Figure 5c), which is consistent
with their impaired handling of glucose. Plasma insulin levels
in response to IV glucose were increased in both groups of mice,
but there were no significant differences between LCHFD and
chow-fed mice (Figures 5b and d). Therefore, despite a tendency
for higher insulin levels during the OGTT (Figure 4c) and following
re-feeding (Figure 3c), this experiment revealed that an LCHFD
did not result in an increased capacity to secrete insulin
in response to glucose. Indeed, when the incremental area under
the curve from the IVGTT was calculated and divided by the 6-h
fasting plasma insulin concentration (as a correction for the
prevailing insulin resistance), there was a significant decrease
in the insulin secretory response (30.5 ± 9.0 vs 9.4 ± 3.5; chow vs
LCHFD, P = 0.03). Therefore, despite limiting postmeal glucose
excursions (Figure 3b) an LCHFD has no benefit for β-cell function
in NZO mice.
An LCHFD does not affect pancreatic morphology in NZO mice
An LCHFD did not affect pancreatic weight (Figure 6a) or
morphology. In histological sections, insulin-containing β-cells
were identified by immunohistochemistry. Analysis of these
sections revealed that islet density, islet size and β-cell mass

 (Figures 6b–d) were not increased in mice fed an LCHFD. Thus
there was no evidence that an LCHFD can have a beneficial effect
on pancreatic morphology in NZO mice.
DISCUSSION
Recently, there has been increased interest as to whether LCHFDs
could be of use in battling the growing epidemic of obesity
and associated disorders, such as type 2 diabetes. Current dietary
guidelines do not define a specific limit of fat intake.32,33
Moreover, a few articles in the lay and scientific literature suggest
that the intake of total fat and, in particular, saturated fats may not
need to be limited.5,34,35 For type 2 diabetes, a position statement
from the American Diabetes Association recommends that a total
fat intake of 20–35% may be desirable for reducing the risk of
obesity and suggests minimizing carbohydrate intake is appro-
priate for improving glucose control, but it has refrained from
specifying ideal amounts of macronutrients.33 In contrast, some
articles are promoting very low carbohydrate intake for diabetes
patients, but this approach requires further scientific evidence.5,36
Although LCHFDs reduce postmeal glycemic excursions,6,8 high-
dietary fat has clearly been shown, in multiple animal studies,
to cause impairments in the ability of insulin to reduce blood
glucose resulting in glucose intolerance.10,18,20 In the current
study, we examined the effect of an LCHFD on glucose-stimulated
insulin secretion, which is also crucial for maintaining normal
blood glucose control.
NZO mice in this study were fed either an LCHFD or standard
rodent chow diet. Rodent chow is normally low in fat (3%
of energy) and high in carbohydrates (approximately 50% starch).
In contrast, the LCHFD used here had a very low carbohydrate
(only 6% of energy, 100% sucrose) and high fat content (81%
of energy). Most of the dietary fat in the LCHFD was saturated
(55% of total fat by weight). This diet therefore models what
several papers are recommending for obese or diabetic human
subjects.1–5,7 It has been argued that lowering carbohydrates,
whether it is via reduced starch or simple sugars, and replacing
it with fat will be beneficial for glycemic control.5 In this context,
the reduction of dietary carbohydrate in the low-carbohydrate
diet studies in humans has been emphasized, without any
limitations on the type or source of the fat.1,3–5,7 This can lead
to an increase in dietary saturated fat intake that is associated with
increased blood cholesterol levels,37 something that was also seen
here in NZO mice fed an LCHFD. As the levels of beneficial HDL
cholesterol is also often increased with an LCHFD, there is some
controversy as to whether such diets are likely to be associated
with adverse cardiovascular outcomes.5,37 Our study was focused
on determining the potential effects of this dietary regimen on
glucose metabolism.
In prediabetic NZO mice, an LCHFD was accompanied by
reduced blood glucose excursion following food ingestion.
However, fasting blood glucose and insulin were elevated,
suggesting that this diet caused further impairments in insulin
action in these obese and insulin-resistant animals. HFDs have
been routinely used in normal rodents to induce obesity and
metabolic abnormalities, such as insulin resistance.10,18,19,21 In

A low-carbohydrate diet does not improve β-cell function

 NZO mice, our study and others clearly show that increased
dietary fat in these genetically obese animals is also associated
with greater weight gain and insulin resistance.25,27 In this context,
we show that reduced glycemic variability following food
ingestion seen with an LCHFD was not associated with any
improvement in β-cell function. The increased weight gain in NZO
mice following the LCHFD was not associated with increased
energy intake and is therefore likely due to reduced energy
expenditure, as we have previously shown for mice fed a HFD.38
Previous studies in NZO mice have shown that if carbohydrates
are completely removed from the diet, hyperglycemia and
progression to diabetes can be avoided, but only while the mice
remain carbohydrate-free.25,26 However, outside of a tightly
controlled animal study, achieving and maintaining a diet that
has absolutely no carbohydrates will be practically impossible.
In previous studies, when NZO mice were later exposed to dietary
carbohydrates, diabetes developed rapidly and was perhaps even
more severe than what was observed in mice maintained on
a normal rodent chow diet.26 In our study, when the LCHFD-fed
NZO mice were challenged with an oral glucose load, their ability
to restore blood glucose to normal levels was significantly
impaired. This further impairment in glucose metabolism in

 prediabetic mice could be related to the likely impact of increased
weight gain on insulin action in the LCHFD group, but such an
obvious deleterious effect on blood glucose control can only occur
in the absence of β-cell compensation to secrete even more insulin.
A decline in β-cell function is primarily responsible for progressive
worsening of blood glucose control in type 2 diabetes.15 Improve-
ments in insulin sensitivity that are seen after weight loss and
exercise interventions in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance
or newly diagnosed diabetes can effect a temporary improvement
in β-cell function and reduce hyperglycemia.39,40 Indeed both
the Diabetes Prevention Program and the China Da Qing
Diabetes Prevention Study showed that lifestyle interventions
can significantly reduce the incidence of diabetes in a high-risk
population.41,42 Furthermore, caloric restriction has been shown to
significantly improve β-cell function in patients with type 2
diabetes.43
The
early
use
of
aggressive
antihyperglycemic
pharmacotherapy can also improve β-cell function, resulting in
apparent diabetes remission, at least for a period of time.44,45
Therefore, reducing the requirement for insulin secretion appears
to have significant benefits for pancreatic β-cells. We have
previously shown that high-fat feeding of lean mouse strains led
to increased weight gain, hyperinsulinemia and glucose-mediated
insulin secretion but not an expansion of islet area.21,46 Here we
have shown that an LCHFD reduced glycemic variability after
a meal, but it was not able to improve β-cell function or mass in
prediabetic NZO mice. Any potential benefit of reducing postmeal
glucose excursion with such a dietary approach therefore appears
to be outweighed by increased weight gain and a requirement for
fasting hyperinsulinemia, which may be detrimental to β-cell
function. Indeed, there is mounting evidence that initial hyperse-
cretion of insulin in prediabetes contributes to β-cell stress and
failure.47,48 Therefore, rather than being beneficial, an LCHFD may
ultimately contribute to faster decline in β-cell function.
Aside from effects on blood glucose levels, LCHFDs have also
been purported to have other potential benefits in obese subjects.
In NZO mice, an LCHFD was associated with reduced plasma
triglycerides, which is consistent with clinical studies that show
reducing dietary carbohydrate, even in the context of a high-fat
intake, can improve blood lipid profiles.2,6,49,50 However, HFDs
in both rodent and clinical studies are also associated with
higher total cholesterol levels.2,18 In our study, in NZO mice,
increased total cholesterol levels associated with the LCHFD,
which is high in saturated fat, was mainly owing to increased HDL
cholesterol, the predominant form of circulating cholesterol
in rodents.51 Increased HDL cholesterol is associated with better
cardiovascular outcomes52 and has been seen with increased
dietary saturated fat intake in humans.53 However, in the context
of other factors associated with high saturated fat intake, whether
this has a net benefit for preventing heart failure is not clear. It is
therefore important to weigh up all the potential positive and
negative effects when considering an LCHFD in patients with
metabolic syndrome or prediabetes. If there is increased weight
gain and insulin resistance associated with these potentially
positive changes in lipid profiles, then it is unlikely that an LCHFD
would be beneficial overall.
The potential effect of popular weight loss diets needs to be
carefully considered with the help of sound evidence before they
are recommended for type 2 diabetes. In our study, we were
specifically interested in determining whether an LCHFD would
improve β-cell function and therefore whether it may be useful
for preventing deterioration in glucose control in a model of
obesity and type 2 diabetes. We found that such a diet in
prediabetic mice was associated with reduced glycemic excursion
after a meal but caused increased weight gain and adipose tissue
mass. Increased weight gain requires a chronic hypersecretion
of insulin and a greater response to a glucose challenge, but with
an LCHFD, there was no improvement in β-cell function or mass
in NZO mice. Overall, this diet resulted in greater impairment in
glucose tolerance. Our results do not support the recommenda-
tion of an LCHFD for use in prediabetes; rather interventions
aimed specifically at reducing obesity and improving insulin
sensitivity should be pursued.
