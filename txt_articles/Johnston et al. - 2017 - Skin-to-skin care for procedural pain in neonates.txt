Background
Skin-to-skin care (SSC), often referred to as ’kangaroo care’ (KC) due to its similarity with marsupial behaviour of ventral maternal-
infant contact, is one non-pharmacological intervention for pain control in infants.
Objectives
The primary objectives were to determine the effect of SSC alone on pain from medical or nursing procedures in neonates compared
to no intervention, sucrose or other analgesics, or additions to simple SSC such as rocking; and to determine the effects of the amount
of SSC (duration in minutes), method of administration (e.g. who provided the SSC) of SSC in reducing pain from medical or nursing
procedures in neonates
The secondary objectives were to determine the safety of SSC care for relieving procedural pain in infants; and to compare the SSC
effect in different postmenstrual age subgroups of infants.
Search methods
For this update, we used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review group to search the Cochrane Central Register
of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 1); MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 25 February 2016); Embase (1980 to 25 February
2016); and CINAHL (1982 to 25 February 2016). We also searched clinical trials’ databases, conference proceedings, and the reference
lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized trials.
Selection criteria
Studies with randomisation or quasi-randomisation, double- or single-blinded, involving term infants (≥ 37 completed weeks’ post-
menstrual age (PMA) to a maximum of 44 weeks’ PMA and preterm infants (< 37 completed weeks PMA) receiving SSC for painful
procedures conducted by healthcare professionals.
Data collection and analysis
The main outcome measures were physiological or behavioural pain indicators and composite pain scores. A mean difference (MD)
with 95% confidence interval (CI) using a fixed-effect model was reported for continuous outcome measures. We included variations
on type of tissue-damaging procedure, provider of care, and duration of SSC.

 Main results
Twenty-five studies (n = 2001 infants) were included. Nineteen studies (n = 1065) used heel lance as the painful procedure, one study
combined venepuncture and heel stick (n = 50), three used intramuscular injection (n = 776), one used ’vaccination’ (n = 60), and one
used tape removal (n = 50). The studies were generally strong and had low or uncertain risk of bias. Blinding of the intervention was
not possible, making them subject to high risk, depending on the method of scoring outcomes.
Seventeenstudies(n=810)comparedSSCtoano-treatment control. Although 15 studiesmeasuredheartrate duringpainful procedures,
data from only five studies (n = 161) could be combined for a mean difference (MD) of −10.78 beats per minute (95% CI −13.63
to −7.93) favouring SSC. Meta-analysis of four studies (n = 120) showed no difference in heart rate following the painful procedure
(MD 0.08, 95% CI −4.39 to 4.55). Two studies (n = 38) reported heart rate variability with no significant differences. Two studies
(n = 101) in a meta-analysis on oxygen saturation at 30 and 60 seconds following the painful procedure did not show a difference.
Duration of crying meta-analysis was performed on four studies (n = 133): two (n = 33) investigated response to heel lance (MD =
−34.16, 95% CI −42.86 to −25.45), and two (n = 100) following IM injection (MD = −8.83, 95% CI −14.63 to −3.02), favouring
SSC. Five studies, one consisting of two substudies (n = 267), used the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) as a primary outcome,
which favoured SCC at 30 seconds (MD −3.21, 95% CI −3.94 to −2.47), at 60 seconds (3 studies; n = 156) (MD −1.64, 95% CI
−2.86 to −0.43), and at 90 seconds (n = 156) (MD −1.28, 95% CI −2.53 to −0.04); but at 120 seconds there was no difference (n
= 156) (MD 0.07, 95% CI −1.11 to 1.25). No studies on return of heart rate to baseline level, cortisol levels, and facial actions could
be combined for meta-analysis findings.
Eight studies compared SSC to another intervention with or without a no-treatment control. Two cross-over studies (n = 80) compared
mother versus other provider (father, another female) on PIPP scores at 30, 60, 90, and 120 seconds with no significant difference.
When SSC was compared to other interventions, there were not enough similar studies to pool results in an analysis. One study
compared SSC (n = 640) with and without dextrose and found that the combination was most effective and that SSC alone was more
effective than dextrose alone. Similarly, in another study SSC was more effective than oral glucose for heart rate (n = 95). SSC either
in combination with breastfeeding or alone was favoured over a no-treatment control, but not different to breastfeeding. One study
compared SSC alone and in combination with both sucrose and breastfeeding on heart rate (HR), NIPS scores, and crying time (n =
127). The combinations were more effective than SSC alone for NIPS and crying. Expressed breast milk was compared to SSC in one
study (n = 50) and found both equally effective on PIPP scores. There were not enough participants with similar outcomes and painful
procedures to compare age groups or duration of SSC. No adverse events were reported in any of the studies.
Authors’ conclusions
SSC appears to be effective as measured by composite pain indicators with both physiological and behavioural indicators and, inde-
pendently, using heart rate and crying time; and safe for a single painful procedure. Purely behavioural indicators tended to favour
SSC but with facial actions there is greater possibility of observers not being blinded. Physiological indicators were mixed although the
common measure of heart rate favoured SSC. Two studies compared mother-providers to others, with non-significant results. There
was more heterogeneity in the studies with behavioural or composite outcomes. There is a need for replication studies that use similar,
clearly defined outcomes. Studies examining optimal duration of SSC, gestational age groups, repeated use, and long-term effects of
SSC are needed. Of interest would be to study synergistic effects of SSC with other interventions.

Skin-to-skin care with newborns cuts down procedural pain
Review question: Is skin-to-skin care effective in cutting down pain from procedures in newborns? Are there any safety issues?
Background: Newborns wearing only a diaper being held next to their mother’s bare chest is referred to as skin-to-skin contact and is
also sometimes called ’kangaroo care’ because of its similarity to the way kangaroo mothers care for their young. Newborns, especially
those who must spend time in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, must have various tests and procedures as part of their care, for example
heel stick, venous puncture, and injections. Giving analgesic drugs for these procedures can often pose problems so that alternatives to
drugs must be found.
Study characteristics: Twenty-eight studies in which newborn babies who were by chance in the kangaroo care group or condition
were included from an extensive search of the literature. Skin-to-skin care was clearly defined and could have been compared to no
pain-reducing strategies or other pain-reducing strategies such as sweet taste. Studies were examined which examined well-established

 signs of pain, both physiological and behavioural, as well as a combination of physiological and behavioural signs. Different providers
of skin-to-skin care other than the mother were included.
Key results: Kangaroo care appears to reduce the pain response to, and recovery from, these frequent procedures, although few studies
could be combined to provide strong evidence. As far as it has been reported, skin-to-skin care is safe. Although it appears that skin-
to-skin care is effective, the size of the benefit remains uncertain.
Quality of evidence: The quality of evidence in these studies was generally low for the response to the actual procedure but was

Description of the condition
The preterm neonate frequently spends the first days or weeks
of life in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), where numer-
ous painful procedures are part of routine care (Johnston 1997;
Simons 2003; Stevens 2003; Johnston 2008; Johnston 2011b;
Cruz 2016). There is substantial evidence that long-term blunt-
ing of behavioural, autonomic, and hormonal responses - and
even brain and cognitive development - result from early un-
treated exposure to pain in preterm neonates (Johnston 1996;
Oberlander 2000; Grunau 2007a; Grunau 2007b; Brummelte
2012; Vinall 2014). The most common painful procedures are
heel lance and intravenous line insertions. Topical anaesthetics
have not been found to be effective in this population (Larsson
1996; Stevens 1999a). Sucrose has been shown to be effective
(Stevens 2013); but frequently repeated doses of sucrose in the
very preterm neonate may not be safe (Johnston 2002; Lefrak
2006; Johnston 2007a). Parenteral analgesics either have nega-
tive sequelae (Marsh 1997; Anand 2004; Carbajal 2005); or have
not been tested for pain in this population (Cuzzolin 2001). Be-
havioural methods of pain control such as non-nutritive sucking,
simulated rocking, facilitated tucking and positioning have been
tested (Pillai Riddell 2015), with non-nutritive sucking having a
significant effect even in very preterm neonates (Campos 1994;
Corff 1995; Stevens 1999b; Akman 2002; Carbajal 2002; Boyle
2004; Cignacco 2007). There is a large volume of literature on
pain in neonates, including a review of over 40 measures of pain
(Stevens 2007). Several studies have reported important age differ-
ences in response, with more preterm neonates having less robust
and less sustained responses (Craig 1984; Johnston 1993; Stevens
2007; Gibbins 2008).
Description of the intervention
Recently there has been growing interest in how mothers of
preterm neonates can contribute to the promotion of growth and
comfortinthe NICUsetting.Thishasbeenbasedontwopremises:
(1) the loss of comfort-providing roles of parents in critical care set-
tings; and (2) the effect of maternal touch specifically in the skin-
to-skin care (SSC) paradigm, on various parameters of neonatal
stability and state regulation. In studies of parents of critically ill
children and infants, parents were concerned about pain manage-
ment and found their child’s suffering a primary source of stress
(Miles 1992; Youngblut 1992; Moehn 1996; Wereszczak 1997).
Even in situations where the staff believed that they were handling
the child’s pain well and that the parents were not distressed, this
was not the case from the parents’ perspective (Simons 2001). In
a US and UK study of 11 NICUs, with 200 parents, almost all
parents reported that their infant had experienced moderate to
severe pain that was worse than they had expected (Franck 2001).
Concerns about pain predicted the most important variance of
parental stress. Another major concern of parents is the loss of
their parental role, including to provide comfort (Miles 1989;
Shields-Poë 1997; Ko 1998). In the above study of NICU par-
ents, 87% stated that they would wish to participate in managing
their infant’s pain (Franck 2002). In a study of mothers engaged
in kangaroo care (KC) while their infants underwent routine heel
lance in the NICU, 80% of the mothers reported positive feelings
and 90% said they would do it again (Campbell-Yeo 2008). A
recent study examining NICU staff nurse beliefs surrounding the
use of SSC for pain management found that while neonatal staff
nurses also positively viewed SSC as an effective pain-relieving in-
tervention, they noted contextual challenges such as heavy nurse-
workload and lack of maternal presence prevented its utilization
(Benoit 2016).
Skin-to-skin care, referred to as kangaroo care because of its sim-
ilarity to marsupial behaviour, was first developed as a method
of providing warmth for low birth weight infants in Bogota,
Columbia in 1979 (Whitelaw 1985). During SSC, a diaper-clad
infant is held upright between the mother’s breasts, at an angle
of approximately 60°, providing maximal skin-to-skin contact be-
tween the baby and parent. A survey on the holding policy in 215
NICUs in the US indicated that almost three-quarters of the units
allowed parents to hold their extubated infant in SSC (Franck
2002). There is extensive literature on KC in developing countries
that is not reviewed here (Charpak 2005).
How the intervention might work
Several recent reviews have been published that report on the pos-
itive outcomes associated with SSC (Campbell-Yeo 2015; Boundy
2016). A review of clinical trials of SSC on targeted infant out-
comes of breastfeeding, behaviour, and physiological adaption in
healthy neonates found 30 studies that met the inclusion criteria,
four being with late preterm infants (Moore 2012). They reported
evidence supporting SSC for success and duration of breastfeeding
(Carfoot 2003; Johnson 2006; Moore 2012). Physiological sta-
bility and temperature control have been consistently reported as
improved during SSC (de Leeuw 1991; Christensson 1992; Bauer
1998; Ludington-Hoe 1999; Gazzolo 2000; Bohnhorst 2001;
Chwo 2002; Ibe 2004; Ludington-Hoe 2004; McCain 2005;
Hunt 2008). For a newborn, behaviour is primarily based on the
sleep and wake state dimension of neurobehavioural organization
involving the ability to make smooth transitions between sleep,
quiet, and awake phases; and to maintain the most desirable state
of quiet sleep (Ludington-Hoe 1996). Several studies have shown
that one to three hours spent in SSC resulted in increased fre-
quency of quiet sleep, longer duration of quiet sleep, and decreased
crying (de Leeuw 1991; Ludington-Hoe 1992; Michelsson 1996;
Feldman 2002; Erlandsson 2007; Kostandy 2008). For example, a
randomized controlled trial (RCT) of healthy newborns randomly
7

 assigned to receive KC for one hour starting within 15 minutes
after birth found that at the four-hour observation time KC in-
fants slept longer, were mostly in a quiet sleep state, exhibited
more flexor movements and postures, and showed fewer exten-
sor movements (Ferber 2004). Feldman and colleagues have re-
portedsustainedneurobehavioural regulationfrom30to37weeks’
gestational age as a result of early KC in the NICU (Feldman
2003). A Cochrane review by Conde-Agudelo reported three stud-
ies on mortality and morbidity and did not address pain response
(Conde-Agudelo 2014). Given that SSC promotes autonomic sta-
bility and state regulation as well as bonding between the mother
and the infant, it is logical that it would be tested as an intervention
for pain where the response to painful stimuli includes autonomic
arousal and crying, in addition to its advantage of giving mothers
back their comforting role.
Why it is important to do this review
The American Pediatric Society and Canadian Paediatric Soci-
ety’s Fetus and Newborn Committee incorporated SSC as a rec-
ommended intervention. However, no systematic review with the
rigour of The Cochrane Collaboration had been conducted un-
til the first review (Johnston, 2014). There could, for example,
be a publication bias that would favour positive outcomes. There
has been a Cochrane review of SSC for mortality and morbidity,
which did favour SSC over usual care controls for infections and
weight gain (Conde-Agudelo 2014).

Primary objectives
1. To determine the effect of SSC alone on pain from medical
or nursing procedures in neonates undergoing painful
procedures compared to no intervention, sucrose or other
analgesics, or additions to simple SSC such as rocking.
2. To determine the effects of the amount of SSC (duration in
minutes), method of administration (who provided the SSC,
positioning of caregiver and neonate pair) of SSC in reducing
pain from medical or nursing procedures in neonates.
Secondary objectives
1. To determine the safety of SSC care for relieving procedural
pain in infants, specifically reports of:
i) bradycardia (heart rate less than 100 for 15 seconds);
ii) desaturation (transcutaneous oxygen saturation
readings of less than 80% for 15 seconds); or
iii) apnoea (absence of spontaneous respiration for 20
seconds, or 10 seconds if accompanied by bradycardia or
desaturation (Lagercrantz 1992)).
2. To compare the SSC effect in different postmenstrual age
subgroups of infants: less than 32 weeks, 32 to 36 weeks, full
term (37 to 42 weeks).

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
Studies with randomisation or quasi-randomisation, and blinded
(for example, coding video tapes of infant faces only or using
physiological datafrommonitors)ornot-blinded assessorsforpain
response were considered for inclusion. This included different
designs such as classic randomized controlled trials, randomized
cross-over trials, and cluster as well as quasi-experimental designs.
Types of participants
Term infants (≥ 37 completed weeks postmenstrual age (PMA))
and preterm infants (< 37 completed weeks PMA) to a maximum
of 44 weeks’ PMA receiving SSC for painful procedures conducted
by doctors, nurses, or other healthcare professionals. The painful
procedures that were included are those that are tissue damaging
or considered painful, such as endotracheal suctioning or tape
removal (Carbajal 2008).
Types of interventions
The infant, wearing no more than a diaper, in ventral skin contact
with another person during a painful procedure. We were inter-
ested in any comparisons of dosage (duration of time in SSC), any
adjuvant therapies (sucrose or other sweet tastes, pacifier, topical
anaesthetics, systemic analgesics), provider of SSC (mother, father,
nurse, other), and variations of SSC such as the addition of rock-
ing or music.
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
Pain response to an invasive procedure, or recovery from an inva-
sive procedure, or both, as measured by at least one of the follow-
ing.
1. Behavioural indicators (audible cry duration in seconds or
milliseconds; audible crying time as a proportion of total
procedure time; proportion of time of total procedure that had
predefined facial actions reflecting grimace e.g. brow bulge, eye
squeeze, nasolabial furrow; proportion of time that had
8

 predefined body movements e.g. limb thrashing, fisting, finger
splaying, limb and torso flexion).
2. Physiological indicator changes from baseline or between
groups in heart rate (HR), respiratory rate, oxygen (O
)
saturation/transcutaneous oxygen tension (tcpO
), and near-
infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). These measures should be
reported before the tissue-damaging part of the procedure,
during the procedure, and in the time to recovery following the
procedure.
3. Hormonal indicators (salivary cortisol, serum beta-
endorphins) obtained from body fluids (saliva, serum) with
description of analyses e.g. radio-immune assay techniques.
4. Validated composite pain scores (including a combination
of behavioural, physiological, and contextual indicators). There
are over 50 measures of pain in neonates in the literature. The
ones that we assessed as being valid for neonates undergoing
procedural pain include:
i) Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) (Stevens 1996;
Stevens 2010). The PIPP includes gestational age, behavioural
state, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and three facial reactions
(brow bulge, eye squeeze, and nasolabial furrow). The range is 0
to 21 with a score of 6 indicating pain.
ii) COMFORT scale (van Dijk 2000). This scale
measures alertness, calmness, respiratory response or crying,
physical movement, muscle tone and facial tension, and separate
latent variables for heart rate (HR) baseline and mean arterial
blood pressure baseline (MAP).
iii) Behavioral Indicators of Infant Pain (BIIP) (Holsti
2007). The BIIP combines sleep and wake states, five facial
actions and two hand actions.
iv) Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) (Lawrence 1993).
The NIPS includes facial expression, cry, breathing pattern,
arms, legs, state of arousal.
v) Neonatal Pain, Agitation, and Sedation Scale (N-
PASS) (Hummel 2008; Hummel 2010). N-PASS was originally
developed to measure ongoing pain but has recently been
validated as a measure of acute pain. It includes crying and
irritability, behaviour and state, facial expression, extremities and
tone, and vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure,
oxygen saturation). It also has scores that rate sedation as well as
pain and agitation.
vi) Douleur Aiguë du Nouveau-né (DAN) (Carbajal
1997). The scale scores pain with a range from 0 to 10 with three
items: facial expression, limb movements, and vocal expression
with ratings per item ranging from 0 to 4, 0 to 3 and 0 to 3,
respectively.
All of these indicators yield continuous data, although the NIPS
was reported as proportion of infants in low, moderate, or severe
pain and was analyzed as risk ratio, not mean difference.
There are repeated measures across time and conditions within
participants. For the cross-over design studies, the first condition
was analyzed.
These indicators were taken immediately prior to, during, and
immediately following the painful procedure. The differences be-
tween the changes from baseline between groups were used.
Secondary outcomes
Response of SSC provider, including self-report, cortisol, and
physiological indicators.
Adverse events including (Lagercrantz 1992):
1. bradycardia (heart rate less than 100 for 15 seconds);
2. desaturation (transcutaneous oxygen saturation levels less
than 80 for 15 seconds);
3. apnoea (absence of spontaneous respirations for more than
20 seconds or for 10 seconds if accompanied by bradycardia or
desaturation).
These indicators are binary and were categorized as ’yes’ or ’no’.
Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
For the 2016 update we conducted a comprehensive search includ-
ing: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL;
2016, Issue 1) in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE via PubMed
(1966 to 25 February 2016); Embase (1980 to 25 February 2016);
and CINAHL (1982 to 25 February 2016) using the following
search terms: ((painful procedure OR invasive procedure OR heel
lance OR heel stick OR blood procurement OR venipuncture OR
intravenous start OR arterial line insertion OR injection OR im-
munization AND analgesia OR pain OR comfort) AND (skin-to-
skin OR kangaroo care OR kangaroo mother care)), plus database-
specific limiters for RCTs and neonates (see Appendix 1 for the
full search strategies for each database). We did not apply language
restrictions.
We searched clinical trials’ registries for ongoing or recently com-
pleted trials (clinicaltrials.gov; the World Health Organization’s
International Trials Registry and Platform www.whoint/ictrp/
search/en/; and the ISRCTN Registry).
For the previous review, these databases were searched in Au-
gust 2013: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CEN-
TRAL) in the Cochrane Library; Evidence-Based Medicine Re-
views; MEDLINE (1950 onwards); PubMed (1975 onwards);
Embase (1974 onwards); CINAHL (1982 onwards); Web of Sci-
ence (1980 onwards); LILACS database (1982 onwards); SCI-
ELO database (1982 onwards); PsycInfo (1980 onwards); AMED
(1985 onwards); Dissertation-Abstracts International (1980 on-
wards).

 Searching other resources
In addition to the electronic searches noted above, we searched the
following sources: Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies
in Health (CADTH), University of British Columbia (UBC) Li-
brary, EAGLE, National Technical Information Service (NTIS),
PsycEXTRA, Wikipedia, and the Web of Knowledge. We manu-
ally searched bibliographies of the most recent relevant paediatric,
neonatal, and pain journals and recent major paediatric pain con-
ference proceedings. We did not include unpublished studies in
our search, except with author response. We listed abstracts under
excluded studies. We did not impose language restrictions.
We made efforts to seek unpublished studies using Paediatric Pain
and Neonatology Listservs, requesting readers to reply.
Data collection and analysis
We developed a data-extraction Excel file that allowed us to make
decisions about whether or not to include a study for initial selec-
tion. We selected studies that addressed the efficacy and safety of
SSC compared to another condition for relieving pain in infants.
Four review authors (MCY, AF, TD, BB) independently screened
the titles and abstracts of all the references retrieved by the search
strategy. At this stage, efforts were made to aim more for sensitiv-
ity than specificity: that is, we wished to be more inclusive than
exclusive.
We resolved any differences by discussion among the screening
review authors as well as a fifth review author (CJ). We used Review
Manager (RevMan) 5 software to collate the data.
Selection of studies
Using the studies selected from the above steps, we independently
assessed the full texts of relevant papers to determine whether
or not they met the inclusion criteria. We evaluated studies for
methodological quality and appropriateness for inclusion accord-
ing to the selection criteria. We resolved disagreements by discus-
sion with two review authors (CJ and MCY).
We listed rejected studies in the ’Characteristics of excluded
studies’ table, and we recorded the reasons for exclusion. Review
authors were not blinded to author, institution, journal, or results
of a study during the selection process.
All studies meeting the inclusion criteria underwent quality assess-
ment and data extraction.
Data extraction and management
The following data were extracted.
• Study designs: methods of randomization, intervention,
cross-over design, single centre or multi-centric.
• Participants: PMA, sex, postnatal age at time of
intervention, setting.
• Interventions: position duration, provider, adjuvant
therapies (pharmacological and non-pharmacological).
• Outcomes: pain indicator (behavioural, physiological, and
composite), recovery times.
• Side effects, provider response, study refusals, withdrawals
and dropouts, if reported.
We made attemptstocontactthe studyauthorsifdatawere missing
or needed to be clarified.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
We used the Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias, Cochrane
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, Table 8.5.a
(Higgins 2011). We examined:
1. sequence generation;
2. allocation concealment;
3. blinding of participants, personnel, assessors;
4. incomplete outcome data;
5. selective outcome reporting;
6. other possible sources of bias.
There were three possible answers: low risk, high risk, and unclear
risk.
Funnel plots were not performed given the small number of papers
that could be combined for analysis.
Four review authors (MCY, AF, TD, BB) independently scored
each study for quality, with verification by CJ .
Measures of treatment effect
In studies with continuous data, mean differences (MD) and stan-
dard deviations (SD) in each group and effect size (ES) for the
total were used.
Unit of analysis issues
The unitof analysiswasthe neonatesreceiving SSC.There were in-
stances in which there were repeated measures, for example scores
taken every 30 seconds within a condition (SSC or comparison).
There were no cluster randomized trials.
For cross-over trials, the first condition data were used and the
study was treated as an RCT (Elbourne 2002).
Dealing with missing data
We contacted all authors of studies for missing data, or if clarifica-
tion was required. When the contact was not reciprocated, or the
author was unable to provide the requested data, the study was
excluded from the data synthesis.

 Assessment of heterogeneity
The decision to perform a fixed-effect meta-analysis was based on
the clinical decision regarding the appropriateness of combining
trials and outcomes (Erez 1996; Hedges 1998; Overton 1998;
Field 2003). Heterogeneity was explored using the I² statistic.
The statistical analysis was performed using RevMan 5 software,
which is provided by Cochrane. We applied the Chi² test (Q test)
and the I² statistic to assess between-study heterogeneity. With
continuous data, we expressed the effect as mean difference (MD)
and 95% confidence interval (CI).
Assessment of reporting biases
We sought protocols in trial registries and compared the reports
to the protocols in order to determine if there might be selective
reporting. We would have attempted to contact the corresponding
authors if there had been discrepancies, but there were none.
In examining the studies for duplication bias, we closely examined
articles from repeated authors or sites and compared sample size,
characteristic, and details of the studies. When there appeared to
be overlap, we attempted to contact the corresponding author, or
when everything was similar we assumed it was a duplicate and
included only one of the articles.
When we were not successful in contacting authors, the possible
sources of reporting bias were included in our conclusions.
We had planned to do an analysis of publication bias to determine
if negative results were less likely to be published in peer-reviewed
journals. However, we found no examples of significant negative
results, other than for one of several outcomes in one study, in-
cluding in trial registries and in the grey literature. Therefore, this
analysis was not conducted.
We examined the range of languages, locations, and citation
sources to examine potential bias. Only English language reports
were found, although some were from non-anglophone countries.
Data synthesis
For studies using similar outcomes, both in terms of the pain indi-
cator and the time frame examined, we pooled data and analyzed it
together. We computed mean differences. Data were entered into
RevMan via the table of means and standard deviations per group
in order to develop a forest plot.
Quality of evidence
We used the GRADE approach, as outlined in the GRADE Hand-
book (Schünemann 2013), to assess the quality of evidence for the
following (clinically relevant) outcomes: heart rate during painful
procedure, heart rate following painful procedure, PIPP score 30
seconds after painful procedure, NIPS
proportion of infants
in low or no pain during procedure, NIPS - infants in no pain
during recovery, duration of cry following heel lance, duration of
cry following intramuscular (IM) injection.
Two authors independently assessed the quality of the evidence
for each of the outcomes above. We considered evidence from
randomized controlled trials as high quality but downgraded the
evidence one level for serious (or two levels for very serious) limi-
tations based upon the following: design (risk of bias); consistency
across studies; directness of the evidence; precision of estimates;
and presence of publication bias. We used the GRADEpro 2014
Guideline Development Tool to create a Summary of findings for
the main comparison to report the quality of the evidence.
The GRADE approach results in an assessment of the quality of
a body of evidence in one of four grades:
1. High: we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that
of the estimate of the effect.
2. Moderate: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate:
the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but
there is a possibility that it is substantially different.
3. Low: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true
effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.
4.Verylow: we have verylittle confidence inthe effectestimate: the
true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate
of effect.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We were unable to form group analyses as we had intended for the
following categories: gestational age less than 32 weeks, between
32 to 36 weeks, and full term (37 to 42 weeks); or duration or ’dose’
of SSC. There were not sufficient studies with similar outcomes
to compare the effect of SSC on these factors.
As above, we performed heterogeneity tests using the Chi² test and
I² statistic.
Sensitivity analysis
We were not able to conduct a sensitivity analysis as there were
not enough studies examining similar outcomes with similar age
groups or procedures.

2013; Kostandy 2013; Liu 2015); and the remaining 18 were with
preterm neonates (Johnston 2003; Ludington-Hoe 2005; Castral
2008; Freire 2008; Johnston 2008; Kostandy 2008; Akcan 2009;
Cong 2009; Johnston 2009; Okan 2010; Cong 2011; Johnston
2011; Cong 2012; Johnston 2012; Nanavati 2013; Nimbalkar
2013; Mosayebi 2014; Gao 2015). Details of each study are out-
lined in the tables under Characteristics of included studies.
Most (19) of the included studies examined responses to the
painful procedure of heel lance (Gray 2000; Johnston 2003;
Ludington-Hoe 2005; Castral 2008; Freire 2008; Johnston 2008;
Kostandy 2008; Cong 2009; Johnston 2009; Okan 2010; Cong
2011; Johnston 2011; Cong 2012; Johnston 2012; Gabriel 2013;
Nimbalkar 2013; Mosayebi 2014; Gao 2015; Liu 2015) and are
shown in Table 1. Four studies examined the response to intra-
muscular injection (Table 2) (Sajedi 2007; Chermont 2009; Saeidi
2011; Kostandy 2013); one study included both venipuncture and
heel lance (Table 3) (Akcan 2009); three studies examined differ-
ent providers (Table 4); and one study examined response to tape
removal (Table 5) (Nanavati 2013).
Outcome measures were varied among studies, with many in-
cluding more than one. Physiological measures included heart
rate during the painful procedure (Gray 2000; Johnston 2003;
Ludington-Hoe 2005; Sajedi 2007; Castral 2008; Freire 2008;
Johnston 2008; Cong 2009; Okan 2010; Saeidi 2011; Cong 2012;
Gabriel 2013; Kostandy 2013; Nimbalkar 2013; Gao 2015; Liu
2015)andafterthe painful procedure (Gray2000; Ludington-Hoe
2005; Sajedi 2007; Castral 2008; Johnston 2008; Cong 2009;
Cong 2012; Gabriel 2013; Liu 2015); heart rate recovery (time to
return to baseline levels post-procedure (Johnston 2008; Johnston
2009; Johnston 2011; Johnston 2012; Kostandy 2013; Gao2015);
spectral analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals of low fre-
quency spectrum, high frequency spectrum, and low-to-high fre-
quency ratio (Cong 2009; Cong 2012); transcutaneous oxygen
saturation levels (Johnston 2003; Ludington-Hoe 2005; Sajedi
2007; Johnston2008; Okan2010; Saeidi2011; Liu2015); respira-
tory rate (Ludington-Hoe 2005); and salivary cortisol levels (Cong
2011). Behavioural state was used in two studies (Ludington-Hoe
2005; Cong 2009). Cry duration was an outcome for seven studies
(Gray 2000; Ludington-Hoe 2005; Kostandy 2008; Okan 2010;
Saeidi 2011; Gabriel 2013; Kostandy 2013). Facial grimacing, not
according to a validated measure, was used in three studies (Gray
2000; Okan 2010; Gao 2015), while in three others the validated
Neonatal Facial Coding Scale (NFCS) was used (Castral 2008;
Chermont 2009; Okan 2010). Validated composite pain mea-
sures that included both physiological and behavioural indicators
were used in 17 studies. The Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP)
was used in 12 studies (Johnston 2003; Freire 2008; Johnston
2008; Akcan 2009; Chermont 2009; Johnston 2009; Cong 2011;
Johnston 2011; Johnston 2012; Nanavati 2013; Nimbalkar 2013;
Mosayebi 2014), the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) was used
in four studies (Sajedi 2007; Chermont 2009; Saeidi2011; Gabriel
2013) and the Douleur Aiguë du Nouveau-né (DAN) for one Liu
2015.
Excluded studies
Of the 29 studies that were excluded, three focused on breastfeed-
ing (Uga 2008; Abdel-Razek 2009; Obeidat 2015), four did not
have SSC as defined in this review (Bellieni 2002; Arditi 2006;
Bellieni 2007; Vivancos 2010), and three did not have ventral skin
contactasapartof theirSSCintervention(Reis 2003; Axelin2009;
Campbell-Yeo2012). One hadskin-to-skincontactbutnotduring
the procedure (Mitchell 2013). Maternal interview was the focus
of one study (Silva 2004); and maternal mood and stress the focus
of another with no comparison group (Castral 2015). Three stud-
ies did not randomize (Chidambaram 2014; Choudhary 2015;
Olsson 2015). One study used maternal voice without actual
contact (Johnston 2007b); while another used neurobehavioural
scores (NIDCAP) associated with pain, which are not validated
as a pain measure (Ferber 2008). One study, Kashaninia 2008,
was a duplicate of another (Sajedi 2007). One was a protocol of
an ongoing study (Campbell-Yeo 2013). One study used diaper
change as procedure, which is not within our definition of being
tissue damaging or painful (Lyngstad 2014). Finally, seven stud-
ies reported on SSC alone without implementation of a painful
procedure (Mooncey 1997; Gazzolo 2000; Mörelius 2005; Miles
2006; Erlandsson 2007; Gabriel 2010; Schlez 2011).
Risk of bias in included studies
The risk of bias for each study may be seen under Characteristics
of included studies and as percentages across all included studies

percentages across all included studies.
Allocation
Random sequence generation, a procedure to avoid selection
bias, was adequate in 16 studies. Allocation concealment, another
source of selection bias, was deemed adequate for 10 studies.
Blinding
Blinding to avoid performance or detection bias by definition is
impossible to achieve given the nature of the intervention. Clearly
reported blinding of assessors was adequate in only nine of the
studies. Although 12 of the remaining trials did institute measures
to overcome detection bias, there was some uncertainty that the
video recordings were made in such a way that the SSC provider
could not be identified. Only two studies specifically mentioned
how they dealt with blinding the observers.
Incomplete outcome data
Incomplete outcome data were rated above low risk in 19 studies.
Selective reporting
Reporting was adequate in all but three studies. Two were unclear
and one study’s parameters as reported in the trial registry were
not included in the report.
Other potential sources of bias
Fifteen studies had low risk of other biases. There were three in-
dividual cases of high bias: there was a combination of two data
sets; different times for the painful procedure by group were not
included in the regression analysis; and consent was obtained after
randomization. Seven other studies had unclear potential bias. In
one, there was some potential for inconsistency among sites re-
garding sucrose use in the usual care group. A power calculation
was not reported in two studies, and the washout period was not
described in the others.
Heterogeneity results
There were many outcomes for which heterogeneity could not be
measured via the I² statistic, that is, where only one study reported
an outcome such as change in heart rate or change in oxygen
saturation. When the I² statistic could be calculated the results
showed a wide range, with the physiological outcomes having I²
values of 0% and some composite measures having values over
50%, for example, PIPP at 30 seconds following heel lance versus
control, I² = 94%.
Effects of interventions
See: Summary of findings for the main comparison Skin-to-
Skin care for procedural pain in neonates - summary of findings
Inconsistencies in the outcomes prevented all studies from being
included in meta-analyses. Each study is thus reported separately
and appears in Table 1 and Table 2 below, grouped according to
the painful intervention.

 1.1 Heart rate response
Fifteen studies examined heart rate during the heel lance procedure
(Gray 2000; Johnston 2003; Ludington-Hoe 2005; Sajedi 2007;
Castral 2008; Freire 2008; Johnston 2008; Cong 2009; Okan
2010; Cong 2012; Gabriel 2013; Nimbalkar 2013; Gao 2015; Liu
2015) or IM injection (Kostandy 2013). Only five studies could
be combined in an analysis (Ludington-Hoe 2005; Castral 2008;
Cong 2009; Cong 2012; Liu 2015) with all but Liu 2015 (who
compared SSC to swaddled in incubator) comparing SSC to in-
cubator. Since results of the first condition only were not reported
in cross-over designs, and not all authors responded to requests for
the data for the first condition separately, not all crossover studies
could be included in the meta-analysis. One study - Gao 2015 -
reported mean scores over three heel lances, but we were not able to
get data for only one. The duration of time for which the heart rate
was collected either varied between studies or was not reported. Fi-
nally, when authors did respond, the calculations were conducted
differently (that is maximum, not mean heart rate, was acquired).
Cong 2012 reported two studies in the same manuscript, one of
SSC for 30 minutes and one of SSC for 15 minutes. One other
study, Sajedi 2007, examined heart rate averaged over two minutes
during intramuscular injection and reported lower scores, that is,
in favour of SSC. Johnston 2008 provided unpublished data for
the first condition on maximum heart rate with significant differ-
ences in favour of SSC. Okan 2010 reported the median heart rate
for SSC plus breast feeding, SSC alone, and control, and found
significantly higher heart rate in the control but similar levels in
the two intervention groups. Johnston 2003 reported no overall
differences; nor did Gao 2015, who compared heart rate over three
heel lances. Kostandy 2013 did not find any differences between
groups.
The meta-analysis across the five studies of heel lance versus in-
cubator control (one with additional swaddling) showed differ-
ences between the experimental and control groups ranging from
0.57 to 13.53 beats per minute with a significant MD of −10.78
(95% CI −13.63 to −7.93) beats per minute (Analysis 1.1). One
study, with additional swaddling (Liu 2015), made the difference
of whether effect was significant. This effect was based on very low
level evidence.
1.2 Heart rate recovery
Heart rate following the painful procedure was reported in
seven articles, but only four could be entered into the analysis
(Ludington-Hoe 2005; Castral 2008; Cong 2009; Cong 2012).
The MD was not statistically significant with MD 0.08 (95% CI
−4.39 to 4.55) (Analysis 1.2). The level of evidence for this effect
was high. Findings from Gray 2000 favoured SSC, but Kostandy
2013 found no difference. Johnston 2008 reported that the time
to return to baseline heart rate following the application of the
adhesive bandage (signifying the end of blood sampling) was sig-
nificantly faster at 123 seconds (95% CI 103 to 142) for the KC
condition and 193 seconds for the incubator condition (95% CI
158 to 227; F (61, 1) = 13.6, P < 0.001).
1.3 Heart rate variability
Two studies reported heart rate variability as an outcome (Cong
2009; Cong 2012). Both studies had a cross-over design and the
firstconditionwasseparatedoutforthisreview. Low frequencywas
not significant (MD −2.11, 95% CI −17.69 to 13.47) (Analysis
1.3); nor was high frequency (MD −5.11, CI −23.36 to 13.14)
(Analysis 1.4); nor was the low frequency/high frequency (LF/
HF) ratio significantly different (MD −3.77, −13.69 to 6.14)
(Analysis 1.8). In Cong 2012, infants were randomly ordered into
15minutesof SSC,30minutesof SSC,andincubatorcontrol. The
heart rate variability results were not significantly different among
the conditions. The level of evidence for the effect of SSC on heart
rate variability(LF, HF, andLF/HFratio)duringpainful procedure
was low, whereas the level of evidence for the effect of SSC on
heart rate variability LF and HF following painful procedure was
high. The effect of SSC on heart rate variability LF/HF ratio after
painful procedure is supported by low-level evidence.
1.4 Oxygen saturation during painful procedure
Four studies used oxygen saturation as an outcome (Ludington-
Hoe 2005; Sajedi 2007; Johnston 2008; Liu 2015), however only
the latter two could be combined for analysis as they specified 30-
second intervals. The MD at both 30 and 60 seconds was not
significant: at 30 seconds, MD was 1.73 (95% CI −0.53 to 3.99)
(Analysis 1.9); and at 60 seconds MD was 2.17 (95% CI −0.12
to 4.46) (Analysis 1.10). Sajedi 2007 examined full-term neonates
receiving intramuscular injection. Sajedi 2007 reported an almost
4% lower oxygen saturation (P < 0.001) in the control group,
favouring SSC. Ludington-Hoe 2005 did not find significant dif-
ferences between SSC and incubator care. The effect of SSC on
oxygen saturation at 30 seconds is supported by low-level evidence
and the effect at 60 seconds is supported by very low level evi-
dence.
1.5 Oxygen saturation after painful procedure
Two of the same studies as above (Ludington-Hoe 2005; Sajedi
2007) as well as Saeidi 2011 also reported oxygen saturation at
the end of the painful procedure. Sajedi 2007 reported a signif-
icant 2.8% higher oxygen saturation in the SSC group, but the
Ludington-Hoe 2005 study showed wide variance with a similar
magnitude of difference which was not significant. Saeidi 2011
reported non-significant differences in oxygen saturation.
1.6 Change in oxygen saturation
Only one study examined change in oxygen saturation (Freire
2008), in which the difference was not significant between SSC
15
Skin-to-skin care for procedural pain in neonates (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 and standard care control (Table 1). Nimbalkar 2013’s raw data
showed a difference in oxygen saturation but following the Bon-
ferroni correction this was not significant.
1.7 Salivary cortisol
Only one study used salivary cortisol levels as an outcome (Cong
2011 (Study 1 and 2)). There were two subsamples in that study,
one receiving SSC for 80 minutes and the other for 30 minutes.
There were significantly higher salivary cortisol levels in the 80-
minute SSC group (mean ± SD: 0.19 ± 0.10) than the standard
care control group (mean ± SD: 0.15 ± 0.06), P < 0.05. Conversely,
salivary cortisol levels were lower in the 30-minute SSC group
(mean ± SD: 0.21 ± 0.12) than the standard care control group
(mean ± SD: 0.57 ± 0.61), P < 0.05 (Table 1).
1.8 Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) at 30 seconds
Six studies used the PIPP as the outcome for heel lance (Johnston
2003; Freire 2008; Johnston 2008; Cong 2011 (Study 1 and 2)
Mosayebi 2014) or IM injection (Chermont 2009). Cong 2011
was analyzed for the two amounts of time of SSC so that the first
study of 80-minute SSC was entered first and the second study of
SSC for 30 minutes was entered second, although both are listed
as Cong 2011. The PIPP was reported in 30-second blocks from
the time of the heel lance. At 30 seconds, based on analyses of
four of the studies (Johnston 2003; Freire 2008; Johnston 2008;
Cong 2011), there was moderate-level evidence of a significant
effect in favour of SSC (MD −3.21, 95% CI −3.94 to −2.47),
although Cong 2011 (study 1) and Johnston 2008 did not find
a significant difference (Analysis 1.11). Mosayebi 2014 used the
PIPP but changed the scoring to an ordinal scale which could not
be entered into the analysis, although the results favoured SSC.
The means and standard deviations are reported in the text, but
not separated between first and second condition and the authors
did not forward us those separated data.
1.9 PIPP scores at 60 seconds
Three studies used the PIPPas an outcome for heel lance (Johnston
2003; Johnston 2008; Cong 2011 (Study 1 and 2)); and one used
it as an outcome for heel lance or venipuncture (Akcan 2009).
There was a significant difference in favour of SSC in the analysis
of heel lance (MD −1.64, 95% CI −2.86 to −0.43). This effect is
supported by low-level evidence. Johnston 2008 and Cong 2011
(Study 1) did not find a significant difference (Analysis 1.12);
while Akcan 2009 did (SSC = 7.0, Control = 15.0, P < 0.001).
1.10 PIPP at 90 seconds
There was a significant difference in favour of SSC with three
studies for the PIPP score at 90 seconds (MD −1.28, 95% CI
−2.53 to −0.04) (Analysis 1.13) (Johnston 2003; Johnston 2008;
Cong 2011 (Study 2)). This effect is supported by moderate level
evidence.
1.11 PIPP at 120 seconds
Three studies used the PIPP at 120 seconds as an outcome for heel
lance (Johnston 2003; Johnston 2008; Cong 2011); and one used
it as an outcome for heel lance or venipuncture (Akcan 2009).
There was an MD of 0.07 (95% CI −1.11 to 1.25), reflecting no
significant difference (Analysis 1.14). This effect is supported by
moderate level evidence. Akcan 2009 reported PIPP of 4 in the
SSC group compared to 15.5 in control group (P = 0.001).
1.12 PIPP following end of procedure
Two studies, Cong 2011 (two studies of 80 and 30 minutes SSC)
and Akcan 2009, followed PIPP scores beyond the time of the
procedure. In both Cong 2011 studies the PIPP scores favoured
SSC, measured in 30-second blocks for two minutes following the
procedure, by between 8.12 and 0.4 points on the PIPP
. The closer
to the end of the procedure the greater the difference was in scores.
In the first and second minute following end of procedure, Akcan
2009 reported PIPPs of 4 and 4 in infants in KC and 12.5 and 7 in
infants in the control group (P < 0.001, P = 0.023, respectively).
1.13 Neonatal Facial Coding System (NFCS) during painful
procedure
One study used the NFCS as an outcome for heel lance on preterm
neonates (Castral 2008), and another used it as an outcome in
full-term neonates for intramuscular injection (Chermont 2009).
In Castral 2008 there was a mean difference of 1.87 in favour of
SSC (P < 0.001). There was no difference between skin-to-skin
alone and the standard care control in Chermont 2009.
1.14 NFCS at recovery
Similarly, at recovery one study used the NFCS as an outcome
for heel lance in preterm neonates (Castral 2008); and another for
intramuscular injection in full-term neonates (Chermont 2009).
Both studies favoured SSC.
1.15 Duration of crying after painful procedure
Six studies included cry duration as an outcome. Meta-analysis
was conducted including two studies investigating response to heel
lance (MD −34.16, 95% CI −42.86 to −25.45) (Analysis 1.19)
(Ludington-Hoe 2005; Kostandy 2008); and two following IM
injection (MD −8.83, 95% CI −14.63 to −3.02) with results
favouring SSC (Analysis 1.20) (Kostandy 2013; Sajedi 2007). The
level of evidence for the effect of SSC on duration of cry was mod-
erate. The other two studies did not provide enough information
to include their results in the analysis (Gray 2000; Okan 2010).
16
Skin-to-skin care for procedural pain in neonates (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Gray 2000 reported that infants held by mother in skin-to-skin
contact cried an average of 1 second while control infants cried
for a mean of 32 seconds of the 3-minute recovery period (P <
0.001). Similarly Okan 2010 found reduced length of crying in
SSC (mean 65 seconds vs 184 seconds in control, P < 0.001).
1.16 Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS)
Chermont 2009, Saeidi 2011, Sajedi 2007 used the NIPS as an
ordinal outcome and these were able to be entered into an analysis.
There was a significant difference in proportion of infants in no
pain (Risk Difference (RD) 0.10, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.15) versus
severe pain (RD −0.16, 95% CI −0.22 to −0.10) in favour of
SSC during the painful procedure. The level of evidence for this
effect was very low. Similarly during recovery, there was a signifi-
cant relative risk in favour of SSC of those with no pain (RD 0.35,
95% CI 0.26 to 0.44) and those with severe pain (RD −0.23,
95% CI −0.31 to −0.15). The level of evidence in favour of SSC
for the proportion of infants in no pain during recovery was mod-
erate. Gabriel 2013 used NIPS and reported results comparing
interventions in median scores, but had only active comparisons
with no control group.
1.17 Serum cortisol
Only one study examined serum cortisol level, comparing 80 min-
utes and 30 minutes of SSC with a standard care control (Cong
2011). The study showed similar serum cortisol levels in the 80-
minute SSC group (mean ± SD: 5.73 ± 1.97) than the standard
care control group (mean ± SD: 5.32 ± 1.72). Conversely, serum
cortisol levels were lower in the 30-minute SSC group (mean ±
SD: 5.63 ± 2.30) than the standard care control group (mean ±
SD: 9.15 ± 6.59), P < 0.05 (Table 1).
1.18 Douleur Aiguë du Nouveau-né (DAN) Scale
One study used the DAN as an outcome measure and found sig-
nificant differences in favour of the SSC group, although the re-
port does not include specific values, only significance levels (Liu
2015).
1.19 Sleep and wake state
Five studies reported on sleep and wake state (Ludington-Hoe
2005; Sajedi 2007; Kashaninia 2008; Cong 2009; Cong 2012).
Since this is a categorical or ordinal outcome, no analysis was
performed. One study, Sajedi 2007, was conducted with full term
neonates while the others were with preterm neonates. That study
reported state as a dichotomous outcome, ’fussy’ or ’any other
state’, and reported a higher proportion of infants to be in a ’fussy’
state in the control condition. There were no differences in sleep
and wake state at the time of the invasive procedure, although
Cong 2012 reported more infants in the SSC group in quiet sleep
during recovery following the procedure, as did Ludington-Hoe
2005 who reported that infants in SSC were more likely to be in
deep sleep during baseline and heel warming. Kashaninia 2008
reported state as a dichotomous outcome, ’fussy’ or ’any other
state’, and reported a higher proportion of infants to be in a ’fussy’
state in the control condition.
2. Effectiveness of skin-to-skin care (SSC) with
different providers (Comparison 2)
Two studies compared different providers of SSC (Johnston 2011;
Johnston 2012), although Johnston 2012 was reported only as a
pilot study aimed at examining feasibility and effect size (Table 4).
Since both studies examined preterm neonates undergoing heel
lance and used PIPP scores at 30-second intervals over two minutes
following the heel lance as well as heart rate recovery (defined
as time for the heart rate to return to baseline levels) they were
entered into a comparison. Differences in heart rate recovery were
not significant (MD −32.58, 95% CI −94.52 to 28.59) in spite
of the large mean difference in favour of the mother, due mostly
to high variation. The level of evidence for the effect on heart rate
recovery was low. PIPP scores similarly had large mean differences
favouring the mother but the variance was also large so that any
difference was non-significant (Analysis 2.2; Analysis 2.3; Analysis
2.4; Analysis 2.5). The level of evidence for the effect on PIPP 30 at
30, 60, and 90 seconds following painful procedure was moderate,
and at 120 seconds following painful procedure was high.
3. Effectiveness of skin-to-skin care (SSC): analysis by
duration of SSC
Cong 2011 and Cong 2012 reported results from different du-
rations of SSC, the first comparing 80- to 30-minutes SSC and
the second comparing 30 to 15 minutes. Both studies examined
preterm neonates undergoing heel lance and some physiological
outcomes were the same so that an analysis was able to be per-
formed in that report, favouring 30 minutes. No comparisons
could be made between other reports.
4. Effectiveness of skin-to-skin care (SSC) compared
to alternative treatments
There were no studies that could be combined for analysis. There
were some interesting comparisons that are described below.
4.1 SSC versus sweet taste
The study by Chermont 2009 on full-term newborns receiving an
intramuscular injection compared SSC alone or in combination
with dextrose to incubator controls. On the PIPP outcome, SSC
was most effective with or without the addition of dextrose. On
the NFCS and NIPS, SSC was favoured over dextrose or control,
although the combination was most effective. Freire 2008 also
17
Skin-to-skin care for procedural pain in neonates (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 compared SSC with sweet taste (glucose) to control in preterm
neonates undergoing heel lance, with the PIPP score. Heart rate
and oxygen saturation variability (not defined) were reported to
significantly favour SSC over both control and glucose. This was
also reported for the composite measure of these variables, the
PIPP
. All outcomes favoured SSC.
Gabriel 2013 compared SSC alone and in combination with both
sucrose and breastfeeding on heart rate, NIPS scores, and crying
time. The combinations were both more effective than SSC alone
for NIPS and crying.
4.2 SSC versus breastfeeding
Okan 2010 compared SSC to breastfeeding or swaddled control in
full-term neonates undergoing heel lance. In all outcomes (heart
rate, oxygen saturation, NFCS, and duration of crying) there were
no differences between SSC or breastfeeding, but both were better
than the swaddled control group. Gabriel 2013, as above, com-
pared SSC alone and in combination with both sucrose and breast-
feeding on heart rate, NIPS scores, and crying time . The com-
binations were both more effective than SSC alone for NIPS and
crying.
4.3 SSC versus enhanced SSC
One study, Johnston 2009, examined PIPP scores in preterm
neonates undergoing heel lance for differences between SSC and
SSC enhanced by the mother rocking, singing and offering the
infant a finger or pacifier for sucking. There were no differences
between the conditions.
4.4 SSC versus Expressed Breastmilk
One study, Nanavati 2013, comparing SSC with expressed breast
milk for adhesive tape removal, found both interventions equally
effective in diminishing pain.
5. Effectiveness of skin-to-skin care (SSC): analysis by dose
or duration of SSC
The range of time for SSC prior to the intervention was two
minutes (Saeidi 2011) to three hours (Ludington-Hoe 2005). The
only studies that compared times were Cong 2011 and Cong
2012. However, these studies used different outcomes and thus no
analyses could be conducted. In Cong 2011, 80-minute SSC and
30-minute SSC were independently compared to control for the
physiological variables of heart rate and heart rate variability. SSC
was favoured only in the 30-minute condition. In Cong 2012,
the PIPP was used as an outcome for SSC for 15 minutes, SSC
for 30 minutes, or control. The 30-minute SSC was favoured
over control and 15-minute SSC. Although these two studies, not
directly compared, seemed to favour 30 minutes to either longer or
shorter doses, other studies using different outcomes favoured (or
did not favour) SSC for times longer and shorter than 30 minutes
so no conclusion could be made.
6. Effectiveness of skin-to-skin care (SSC): analysis by
postmenstrual age (PMA)
Outcomes of studies reporting different PMAs were different so
that comparisons could not be made. Studies examined different
times and some used the same outcomes (for example, PIPP) but
the comparisons and painful procedures were different so that an
effect size could not be estimated.

Summary of main results
In this revision of the first review of skin-to-skin care (SSC) for
procedural pain in neonates, 25 studies were found that met the
selection criteria of using SSC as an intervention to reduce pain.
Most of the studies used the most common painful event of heel
lance as the painful procedure, although venipuncture and intra-
muscular injections were also among the painful procedures. A
small proportion of studies could be compared due to variations
in design or outcomes. Even if the outcome measures were the
same, they were often used differently enough that they could not
be combined.
The most detailed information was found in studies with preterm
neonates undergoing heel lance for SSC versus control with either
heart rate, heart rate variability, or the composite measure PIPP
and NIPS as outcomes. With the addition of six studies from the
first review to this revision, meta-analyses of heart rate, crying
time, and composite measures of pain PIPP and NIPS were sig-
nificantly favouring SSC. Oxygen saturation, and heart rate vari-
ability differences were not significant.
Two studies examined different providers of SSC and were able to
be entered into an analysis for the PIPP and heart rate recovery.
The differences between mother provider and other provider were
not significant.
No analyses could be conducted on the effect on outcomes of
duration of SSC or different age groups of infants.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
Although most of the studies used heel lance as the painful proce-
dure, several used injections, including ones found for this newer
review, such that we included both procedures in some analyses.
The data analyses tables separate out the procedures, but we report
the overall values which include both sessions.

 Although it would be of interest to know if there was a dose-re-
sponse relationship, that is, did the number of minutes in SSC
increase the effectiveness, we were not able to conduct that anal-
ysis. We were not even able to make a direct comparison of dif-
ferences with 30 minutes as a cut-off point. Ludington-Hoe 2005
reported the longest duration of SSC prior to the painful event of
three hours, and Saeidi 2011 reported the shortest duration of two
minutes. Both of these studies reported results favouring SSC but
no comparisons could be made. One study, Cong 2012, reported
on two samples, one receiving 30 minutes of SSC and the other
only 15 minutes, and both were compared to standard care. There
were positive results only for the group receiving 30 minutes of
SSC, reported as lower serum and salivary cortisol levels.
The providersof SSCwere comparedintwostudies,which showed
mean differences in favour of the mother, but the variance was very
large so there were no significant differences. Only three studies
included full-term neonates and one was for heel lance, for which
standard deviations were not available (Gray 2000). The other two
studies used intramuscular injection rather than heel lance so that
a comparison between full-term neonates and preterm neonates
was not possible (Sajedi 2007; Chermont 2009).
No studies reported any adverse events.
Quality of the evidence
The studies that were included were generally strongly designed
and free from bias. More than half (15/25) of the studies reported
using adequate random allocation, and most reported low risk of
bias related to incomplete data (19/25), selective reporting (20/
25), and other forms of possible bias (13/25). Under half the stud-
ies (10/25) reported adequate allocation concealment and just un-
der a quarter reported adequate blinding (6/25). Sixteen of the
studies did report measures such as blinded assessors using objec-
tive outcome measures and/or ’close up video recording of infant
faces’, but few addressed the issue of whether the presence of the
mother may have been detectable to the assessor. Little informa-
tion was provided regarding the ’usual care’ control, so in the first
comparison of SSC versus no-treatment control we were uncertain
precisely what the control condition was.
The quality of the evidence varied. The quality of the evidence for
heart rate in response to the painful procedure was low, but in re-
covery from the procedure, it was high. It is important to note that
the significant effect size found in heart rate during procedure was
due to a single trial (Liu 2015), with the remaining four studies
finding no effect. While this was the only trial to compare SSC to
a swaddled control (vs no treatment), it is unlikely that this is the
source of the variation as swaddling would be expected to support
regulation of heart rate (Pillai Riddell 2015) and reduce the com-
parative effectiveness of SSC. The quality of evidence regarding
heart rate variability during the procedure was low. Following the
procedure for HF and LF, quality of evidence was moderate, but
for LF/HF it was low. Oxygen saturation studies had low or very
low quality of evidence for SSC. The PIPP at 30 and 90 seconds
for SSC was supported by moderate quality of evidence but at 60
seconds this was low. Cry duration following the tissue-damaging
part of the procedure as an indicator of effectiveness of SSC was
of moderate quality. The NIPS studies for SSC had very low qual-
ity of evidence during the procedure; but after the procedure, the
quality was moderate. In summary, in spite of the range of quality,
it seems as though there is better evidence for SSC in recovery
from a painful procedure than during it.
The degree of heterogeneity of the studies varied a great deal, but
interestingly the more heterogeneous outcomes were physiologi-
cal, even though there is a greater potential for bias in behavioural
outcomes that require human judgement. Only a few studies re-
ported how video recordings avoided identification of the con-
dition. The conflicting results between physiological outcomes,
mostly showing no differences, and composite or behavioural out-
comes generally favouring SSC would suggest caution in interpre-
tation. Further research is needed in order to solve the long-stand-
ing confusion and controversy about which indicators are most
appropriate (Pillai Riddell 2016). The numerical analyses are very
limited, i.e. of the 25 included studies (N = 2001), only up to six
provided data for the primary outcomes. This is a potential source
of bias as it may be that authors chose not to report statistically
insignificant findings.
Potential biases in the review process
Two of the authors of this review (CJ, MCY) authored studies that
were reviewed (Johnston 2003; Johnston 2008; Johnston 2009;
Johnston 2011; Johnston 2012). Anotherauthor(AF)studiedSSC
for her doctoral dissertation and a manuscript is under review. DI
is the manager of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of the IWK
Health Centre and champions SSC as a practice of family-centred
care as well as for procedural pain management.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
There have been a few reviews of non-pharmacological interven-
tions for procedural pain relief in neonates and all support the
practice of SSC (Cignacco 2007; Yamanda 2008; Warnock 2010;
Pillai Riddell 2015). No studies or reviews were found that dis-
agreed.

Implications for practice
Only a maximum of six data sets could be pooled, which did not
enable us to determine an effect size on all outcomes. Nevertheless

 studies comparing skin-to-skin care to standard care, which was
rarely defined, favoured skin-to-skin care or were non-significant.
No studies favoured standard care. In the three studies compar-
ing skin-to-skin care to sweet solution, skin-to-skin care was more
effective in two studies and a possible synergistic effect was re-
ported in the other. The addition of breastfeeding did not appear
to increase the effectiveness of SSC in one study, but did in an-
other. When skin-to-skin care was enhanced by the addition of
the mother’s voice or rocking, it had no additional benefit. There
were no adverse events reported in any of the studies. Therefore,
it would seem that for neonates who are able to be held in the
skin-to-skin care paradigm, using it for the painful procedures of
heel lance, venipuncture, and intramuscular injection is poten-
tially beneficial and not harmful. However, the degree of benefit,
although not estimable, may not be large.
Implications for research
There are numerous areas in this topic that require further research
before definitive statements can be made. First of all, more stud-
ies are needed that use outcomes that are the same as the ones
in this review so that an effect size can be estimated. Secondly,
studies need to be more rigorous about randomization, allocation
concealment, and blinding. Thirdly, when wide age ranges are
used, particularly when full-term and preterm neonates are in the
same study, results for each group should be reported separately.
Although it seems as though a ’dose’ as low as 10 minutes was
effective, more studies testing different durations of the provision
of skin-to-skin care might allow for a dose response analysis to be
conducted. All the studies were conducted using skin-to-skin care
for a single procedure. It would be interesting to determine if the
effect changed with repeated use. Once more studies meet these
criteria, studies on dose - that is, duration of skin-to-skin care -
and other providers would be of interest. More fundamentally, it
would be of interest to explore the underlying mechanism of the
comforting effect of skin-to-skin care and its long-term impact.
One cross-over study that was excluded due to lack of randomi-
sation found that SSC reduced haemodynamic brain response to
venepuncture measured using near-infrared spectroscopy (Olsson
2015); however, more rigorous studies are needed to elucidate such
neurologic mechanisms.

Characteristics of included studies [ordered by study ID]
Akcan 2009
Methods
Randomized controlled trial
Participants
50 preterm infants (PMA 31.6 ± 2.0 weeks)
Postnatal age, mean ± SD, days: 4.7 ± 4.4 (total), 4.9 ± 4.3 (intervention), 4.6 ± 4.5
(control)
Birth weight, mean ± SD, grams: 1669 ± 530 (total), 1577± 491 (intervention), 1762 ±
561 (control)
Painful procedure: heel lance or venepuncture
Study period: February 2006 to December 2006
Interventions
Intervention: 45 minutes of uninterrupted skin-to-skin every day for 5 days, with the
painful procedure carried out on the 5th day
Control: standard care during painful procedure
Provider: mother
Outcomes
PIPP score at 1st, 2nd, and 3rd minute of painful procedure
PIPP score 1st and 2nd minute after painful procedure
Notes
Country: Turkey
Power calculation: no
Risk of bias
Bias
Authors’ judgement
Support for judgement
Random sequence generation (selection
bias)
Unclear risk
“The infants were chosen for the groups using a random
method by drawing out of a thick, non-transparent en-
velope.”
Random method was not clearly described
Allocation concealment (selection bias)
Unclear risk
“The infants were chosen for the groups using a random
method by drawing out of a thick, non-transparent en-
velope.”
It is unclear whether the envelopes were sealed or num-
bered sequentially and if each individual participant was
given an envelope or if group assignment was drawn from
one envelope
Blinding (performance bias and detection
bias)
All outcomes
Unclear risk
“The mothers put on a gown leaving the chest area open
and the infant was placed between the mother’s breasts
with head upright to provide the greatest surface area for
skin contact.”
“The video recordings and monitor records of the infants
in both groups were analyzed by three experts (neona-

tology nurse, neonatologist and anaesthesiologist) who
were totally blind to the study.”
Not clear if camera recording focused only on infants’
faces or if mothers’ skin/breasts could be noted by re-
searchers
Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)
All outcomes
Unclear risk
“A total of 100 infants dropped out of the study (91 dis-
charged within 5 days of admission, mothers of 6 infants
could not come to the unit regularly, and 3 mothers did
not agree to implement KC). As a result, 50 infants com-
prised the sample, with 25 allocated to the KC group and
the other 25 to the control group.”
Data were presented for all participants assigned to in-
tervention and control groups
There is variability in the length of procedure (mean 1
minute for heel lance, 2.5 minutes for venepuncture) and
authors do not report how this is addressed in analysis
(e.g. number of infants in each time point, adjustment
for procedure duration)
Selective reporting (reporting bias)
Low risk
Methods section reported that infants’ behavioural re-
sponses to pain and physiologic variables, such as
heart rate and oxygen saturation, were monitored and
recorded. Although these outcomes compose the PIPP

The authors indicate that they mixed together groups of

envelope. They thus did not use a method to generate the
sequence that is approved in the Cochrane Handbook for
Systematic Reviews of Interventions making this method at
high risk of bias.

The authors report that there were three outcome asses-

they report that they only reported on the data coded
by a single outcome assessor for the study (as a result of
good interclass correlation coefficient) out of the three
individuals who were completing the coding. Therefore,
as a single individual coded the outcome data across all
of the intervention groups, there was no attempt to blind
the outcome assessor to the interventions received. The
authors provide no description of attempts to blind the
outcome assessors
Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)

The main reasons that the authors noted for missing out-
come data in the BF group was non-effective breastfeed-

to-treat protocol and noted that the missing data were
greater in the breastfeeding group compared to the other
groups, they have unexplained missing heart rate data,
hence an assignment of high risk of bias. Authors report
that “correct” heart rate was only obtained in a propor-

correct heart rate in the remaining participants

“Since L.G. conducted all heel sticks because of schedul-

of differential treatment has been introduced. We are not
concerned about this potential bias for a number of rea-
sons. First, the duration of the procedure and apparent
discomfort that it caused in control infants, expressed
in crying, for example, was of the same order of magni-
tude as that caused by the phlebotomist in other studies
conducted in our laboratory. Second, as indicated, mean
blood collection times for both groups were not statis-
tically different. Third, we went through a number of
iterations...before a successful set of parameters was at-
tained. It would seem to us that any systematic bias on
the part of L.G. would have become manifest from the
outset and not after a number of procedural changes.”
