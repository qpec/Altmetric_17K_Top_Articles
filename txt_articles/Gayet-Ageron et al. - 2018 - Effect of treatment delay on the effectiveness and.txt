Introduction
Acute severe bleeding is a leading cause of death.1 
Traumatic extracranial haemorrhage, often the conse­
quence of road traffic crashes or violence, is respons­
ible for more than two million deaths each year.2 
Traumatic and spontaneous intracranial bleeding are 
common causes of death and disability.3 Severe surg­
ical haem 
orrhage strongly predicts adverse patient 
outcomes and is associated with an increase in the 
odds of death by eight times.4 Thousands of patients 
are admitted to hospital with gastrointestinal bleeding 
each year in the UK, with a case fatality of about 
10% for upper gastrointestinal bleeding and 3% for 
lower gastrointestinal bleeding.5,6 Post­partum haem­
orrhage accounts for about 100 000 maternal deaths each 
year worldwide, with the majority occurring in less­
developed countries.7 
Antifibrinolytic drugs (tranexamic acid, aminocaproic 
acid, aprotinin, and aminomethylbenzoic acid) reduce 
bleeding by inhibiting the breakdown of fibrin clots.8,9 
Antifibrinolytics reduce surgical bleeding and the 
need for transfusion by about a third, irrespective of 
the site of surgery.10 Administration of tranexamic 
acid within 3 h of bleeding onset reduces deaths 
from bleeding in patients with trauma and post­
partum haemorrhage.11–13 We sought to quantify the 
effect of treatment delay on the effectiveness of 
antifibrinolytics in acute severe bleeding by analysing 
individual patient­level data from random 
ised placebo­
controlled trials.

Summary
Background Antifibrinolytics reduce death from bleeding in trauma and post-partum haemorrhage. We examined the 
effect of treatment delay on the effectiveness of antifibrinolytics.
Methods We did an individual patient-level data meta-analysis of randomised trials done with more than 1000 patients 
that assessed antifibrinolytics in acute severe bleeding. We identified trials done between Jan 1, 1946, and April 7, 2017, 
from MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science, PubMed, 
Popline, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. The primary measure of treatment benefit 
was absence of death from bleeding. We examined the effect of treatment delay on treatment effectiveness using 
logistic regression models. We investigated the effect of measurement error (misclassification) in sensitivity analyses. 
This study is registered with PROSPERO, number 42016052155.
Findings We obtained data for 40 138 patients from two randomised trials of tranexamic acid in acute severe bleeding 
(traumatic and post-partum haemorrhage). Overall, there were 3558 deaths, of which 1408 (40%) were from bleeding. 
Most (884 [63%] of 1408) bleeding deaths occurred within 12 h of onset. Deaths from post-partum haemorrhage 
peaked 2–3 h after childbirth. Tranexamic acid significantly increased overall survival from bleeding (odds ratio 
[OR] 1·20, 95% CI 1·08–1·33; p=0·001), with no heterogeneity by site of bleeding (interaction p=0·7243). Treatment 
delay reduced the treatment benefit (p<0·0001). Immediate treatment improved survival by more than 70% (OR 1·72, 
95% CI 1·42–2·10; p<0·0001). Thereafter, the survival benefit decreased by 10% for every 15 min of treatment delay 
until 3 h, after which there was no benefit. There was no increase in vascular occlusive events with tranexamic acid, 
with no heterogeneity by site of bleeding (p=0·5956). Treatment delay did not modify the effect of tranexamic acid on 
vascular occlusive events.
Interpretation Death from bleeding occurs soon after onset and even a short delay in treatment reduces the benefit of 
tranexamic acid administration. Patients must be treated immediately. Further research is needed to deepen our 
understanding of the mechanism of action of tranexamic acid.

Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
We did an individual patient­level data meta­analysis of 
randomised placebo­controlled trials done with more than 
1000 patients that assessed the effects of antifibrinolytics 
(including aprotinin, tranexamic acid, aminocaproic acid, 
and aminomethylbenzoic acid) in acute severe bleeding. 
We identified trials done between Jan 1, 1946, and 
April 7, 2017, from a register of antifibrinolytic trials 
maintained by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical 
Medicine Clinical Trials Unit. The register comprises 
MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of 
Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science, PubMed, 
Popline, and the WHO International Clinical Trials 
Registry Platform (appendix). Abstracts were screened for 
relevant trials and selection criteria were applied. Reasons 
for exclusion were discussed and discrepancies were 
solved by consensus. Two reviewers (AG­A and KK) 
independently extracted data to minimise bias. We 
analysed individual patient­level data for baseline, 
outcome, and predictor variables (treatment delay reported 
in the CRASH­2 trial, dates of randomisation and dates of 
death in CRASH­2, dates and times of randomisation, and 
births and deaths in the WOMAN trial) from the selected 
trials. We prepared a statistical analysis plan before 
searching for trials. We registered the study protocol in 
November, 2016 (PROSPERO, number 42016052155). 
Institutional review board approval was not required. 
Outcomes
The primary measure of treatment benefit was absence of 
death from bleeding (ie, survival from bleeding or death 
from other causes). Death due to bleeding was chosen as 
the primary outcome because of the mechanism of action 
of antifibrinolytic drugs. These drugs inhibit the 
breakdown of fibrin clots and reduce bleeding. All­cause 
mortality is a composite outcome that combines deaths 
likely to be affected by antifibrinolytic treatment (eg, 
deaths from bleeding) with those unlikely to be affected 
by treatment (eg, sepsis), and this outcome would bias 
the relative risk towards the null.14,15 Although some 
authors believe that tranexamic acid decreases trauma 
mortality by preventing inflammation, there is little 
evidence to support this hypothesis and the main effect of 
tranexamic acid is a reduced risk of exsanguination on 
the day of injury.16 Secondary outcomes were vascular 
occlusive fatal and non­fatal events (myocardial infarction, 
stroke, pulmonary embolism, and deep vein thrombosis).
We evaluated the quality of the clinical trials selected by 
assessing sequence generation, allocation concealment, 
blinding, data completeness, and risk of selective 
reporting. Two reviewers (AG­A and KK) independently 
rated the risk of bias according to established criteria.17
We estimated treatment delay as the interval between 
bleeding onset and start of antifibrinolytic treatment. In 
the CRASH­2 trial, clinicians reported treatment delay. 
In the WOMAN trial, we estimated treatment delay as 
the interval between birth and randomisation.
Data analysis
All analyses were done according to the intention­to­
treat principle. Data analysis was based on individual 
patient­level data. For continuous variables, we have 
reported the mean, SD, and median (IQR). For 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We sought to identify whether the benefits and harms of 
antifibrinolytic treatment vary by site of bleeding and time to 
treatment, by doing an individual patient-level data 
meta-analysis of relevant randomised trials done with more than 
1000 participants. Systematic searches of MEDLINE, Embase, 
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), 
PubMed, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and 
ClinicalTrials.gov identified two randomised trials that assessed 
the effect of time to treatment in subgroup analyses (treatment 
started less than or more than 3 h since bleeding onset). Both 
trials had a low risk of bias and both showed that starting 
tranexamic acid within 3 h of bleeding onset reduced death from 
bleeding. However, no studies examined whether the effects of 
treatment varied by site of bleeding or explored the continuous 
association between treatment delay and the effectiveness and 
safety of antifibrinolytics.
Added value of this study
This individual patient-level data meta-analysis comprises 
data on 40 138 bleeding patients from two large trials in 
traumatic and post-partum bleeding. Most deaths from 
haemorrhage occur within hours of bleeding onset. We found 
no evidence that the effectiveness and safety of tranexamic 
acid varied by site of bleeding but found strong evidence that 
treatment delay reduces the survival benefit of tranexamic 
acid administration. Whereas immediate treatment greatly 
increases the odds of survival, the benefit decreases by about 
10% for every 15 min of treatment delay until 3 h, after which 
there is no benefit.
Implications of all the available evidence
Patients with acute severe bleeding should receive 
antifibrinolytic treatment as soon as possible after bleeding 
onset. Trauma patients should be treated at the scene of injury 
and post-partum haemorrhage should be treated as soon as 
the diagnosis is made. Clini 
cal audit should record the time 
from bleeding onset to tranexamic acid treatment, with 
feedback and best practice benchmarking.

categorical variables, we have reported numbers and 
proportions. We plotted frequency distributions for 
treatment delay and time to death from bleeding for 
each trial. We assessed the natural history of death from 
bleeding by plotting frequency distributions of hours to 
death from bleeding among untreated women with post­
partum haemorrhage. We compared patients who died 
from exsanguination and were treated within the first 
hour with those who received later treatment, by use of 
the χ² test (type of injury, sex) or Student’s t test (age, 
systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and volume of blood 
loss). We have reported deaths and vascular occlusive 
events by treatment allocation for each trial and overall.
We examined the effectiveness of antifibrinolytics on 
binary outcomes using logistic regression. We have 
reported treatment effects with odds ratios (OR) and 
95% CI. We expressed the effect of antifibrinolytics on 
survival as the OR for absence of death from bleeding 
(relative treatment benefit). We first assessed the 
homogeneity of the treatment effects between trials by 
including an interaction term between the treatment 
and the trial variable and reporting the p value (model 1, 
appendix).18 We anticipated that treatment effect might 
be affected negatively by treatment delay and explored 
the effect of treatment delay on treatment effect by 
including terms for hours of treatment delay and its 
square (because of the non­linearity of the treatment 
effect), and interactions between these two variables 
with treatment group. To check the homogeneity of the 
effect of treatment delay across trials, we ran a second 
model with a triple interaction between the terms for 
treatment delay, the treatment group, and the trial 
(model 2, appendix). Once homogeneity of the effect of 
treatment delay across trials was verified, we reported 
results from a third model including the two interaction 
terms (model 3, appendix). We quantified the effect 
of treatment delay on treatment effectiveness by 
estimating [100 – (OR at time t – 1) / (OR at t=0 – 1) × 100], 
corresponding to the percentage reduction in maximal 
effectiveness at interval t by use of ORs from model 3. 
The biological plausibility of model 3 was assessed by 
reporting relative treatment benefits stratified by 60­min 
intervals of treatment delay. Because the effect of delay 
on treatment effectiveness might be confounded by 
bleeding severity, all models were controlled for systolic 
blood pressure (5 mm Hg intervals) and age (10­year 
intervals), which are strong risk factors for death due 
to bleeding.19
Because the time of bleeding onset (ie, time of injury) 
is often unknown in trauma patients, measurement 
error is inevitable. We investigated the effect of mis­
classification of treatment delay in sensitivity analyses 
using a range of plausible errors.20 We added a random 
number of minutes to the treatment delay using a 
uniform distribution with a constant minimum set at 0 
and four sets of maximum value: 15, 30, 45, and 60 min 
in the CRASH­2 dataset only. The corrections were based 
on data from an audit of treatment delay in a similar trial 
in traumatic brain injury (the CRASH­3 trial), in which 
treatment delay was rarely overestimated but often 
underestimated (mean underestimation 51 min).21 In the 
WOMAN trial, treatment delay might have been 
overestimated by considering the time of birth as the 
time of bleeding onset. We therefore subtracted a random 
number of minutes from the treatment delay using a 
uniform distribution with a constant minimum set at 0 
and one maximum value of 30 min in the WOMAN 
dataset (post­hoc analysis). For each of the four maximum 
values in the CRASH­2 dataset and the single maximum 
value in the WOMAN dataset, we re­estimated the final 
model 100 times to obtain ranges for the time to 
treatment interaction (model 3). We ran all analyses in 
Stata/IC, version 14.2.

available [EUCTR2015­002661­36­GB, NCT01060176, and 
NCT02936661]; appendix). All completed trials used 
tranexamic acid. The CRASH­2 trial11 assessed the effects 
of tranexamic acid on death and vascular occlusive events 
in 20 211 bleeding trauma patients. The WOMAN trial12 
assessed the effects of tranexamic acid on death, 
hysterectomy, and other morbidities in 20 060 women with 
post­partum haemorrhage. The ATACAS trial22 assessed 
the effects of tranexamic acid on death and thrombotic 
events in 4662 patients undergoing coronary artery surgery. 
Because all patients in the ATACAS trial were treated 
30 min after induction of anaesthesia, we could not explore 
the effect of treatment delay in this trial. The included 
trials had low risk of bias for all domains (appendix).
We 
obtained 
individual 
patient­level 
data 
for 
40 138 participants: 20 127 from the CRASH­2 trial and 
20 011 from the WOMAN trial (table 1). The CRASH­2 trial 
participants were older than WOMAN trial participants. 
Of the 40 138 participants, 20 094 received tranexamic acid 
and 20 044 received placebo (table 2). Of the 3558 deaths, 
1408 (40%) were due to bleeding, of which 884 (63%) 
occurred within 12 h of bleeding onset (appendix). In the 
WOMAN trial, where data on time to death were available, 
deaths from bleeding peaked at 2–3 h after bleeding onset 
in untreated women (figure 2). In the WOMAN trial, we 
excluded 109 (0·5%) patients with a treatment delay of 
more than 24 h (59 patients in the placebo group and 50 in 
the tranexamic acid group) on the basis of the WHO 
definition for primary post­partum haemorrhage.28 We 
found no heterogeneity in the treatment effect between 
trials 
(model 
1: 
interaction 
p=0·7243, 
appendix). 
Tranexamic acid significantly increased overall survival 
from bleeding (OR=1·20, 95% CI 1·08–1·33; p=0·001). 
We found similar results when we excluded from analysis 
the 2150 deaths from causes other than bleeding (data not 
shown).
The appendix shows the treatment benefits stratified by 
60­min intervals of delay. With the exception of the first 
hour, effectiveness decreased with increasing treatment 
delay. Among patients who died from bleeding (appendix), 
we found that those who received treatment within the 
first hour were more often women and were younger 
with a higher proportion of penetrating injuries (for 
trauma patients). We found no heterogeneity in the 
interaction between treatment delay and the effect of 
tranexamic acid between trials (model 2: p=0·1363 for the 
triple interaction between the trial, tranexamic acid, and 
treatment delay with linear terms and p=0·3891 for the 
triple interaction between the trial, tranexamic acid, and 
treatment delay with squared terms). In model 3, 
treatment delay appeared to reduce the treatment benefit 
(p<0·0001 for the trend of increasing benefit with earlier

treatment, figure 3) after adjustment for age and systolic 
blood pressure. When given immediately, tranexamic 
acid significantly improved survival (OR=1·72, 95% CI 
1·42–2·10; p<0·0001) but the benefit decreased with 
increasing delay in a non­linear association (p=0·0109 for 
the interaction between treatment group and treatment 
delay squared). We estimated the time at which the lower 
bound of the 95% CI crossed the null value to be 135 min, 
with no apparent treatment benefit observed at 180 min. 
From model 3, we estimated that the treatment benefit 
decreased by 10% for every 15 min of treatment delay 
(figure 4). We found the same results after exclusion of 
deaths from other causes (data not shown).
After applying a random correction of up to 60 min to 
treatment delay for patients in the CRASH­2 trial and a 
random subtraction of up to 30 min to treatment delay in 
the WOMAN trial (post­hoc analysis), the relative 
treatment benefit from immediate tranexamic acid 
treatment varied between 70% (OR 1·70, 95% CI 
1·38–2·11) and 82% (1·82, 1·47–2·25), with an average of 
77% (1·77, 95% CI 1·43–2·18; appendix). The timepoint 
at which tranexamic acid had no effect increased from 
180 min to 200 min.
The risk of vascular occlusive events was higher in 
patients with traumatic bleeding than in those with post­
partum haemorrhage. There was no increase in fatal 
vascular occlusive events with tranexamic acid (OR 0·73, 
95% CI 0·49–1·09; p=0·1204), with no heterogeneity 
between trials (p=0·5956; appendix). There were fewer 
cases of myocardial infarction (mostly reported in 
CRASH­2) with tranexamic acid (OR=0·64, 95% CI 
0·43–0·97; p=0·0371) but there was no significant 
reduction in other vascular occlusive events. Treatment 
delay did not modify the effect of tranexamic acid on 
vascular occlusive events even after correction for 
misclassification. Adjustment for age or systolic blood 
pressure did not influence the results.
Discussion
The principal findings of our individual patient­level data 
meta­analysis are that most deaths from bleeding occur 
on the day of onset and many occur within the first few 
hours. Deaths from post­partum haemorrhage peak at 
2–3 h after childbirth. Tranexamic acid improves survival 
but treatment delay reduces the benefit. Every 15 min of 
treatment delay appears to decrease the benefit by about 
10%, with no benefit after 3 h. We found no increase in 
vascular occlusive events with tranexamic acid.
Our study has various strengths and limitations. First, to 
reduce selection bias we excluded trials with fewer than 
1000 patients. Small trials are underpowered to assess 
effects on death and there is an increased risk of selective 
reporting.29 Second, time of death was only available for 
post­partum haemorrhage. However, the distribution of 
deaths by days since bleeding onset was similar in 
traumatic and post­partum bleeding, and studies show 
that deaths from traumatic bleeding also peak in the first 
few hours after injury.30 Third, we assessed the effect of 
treatment delay on treatment effectiveness by use of 
logistic regression models with second­order polynomials 
to take into account the non­linearity of treatment effect. 
Because an on–off step function in treatment effectiveness 
is biologically implausible and highly unlikely, we used 
treatment delay as a continuous variable. To explore the 
interaction between treatment effect and time, we used all 
observations of patients treated within 24 h from bleeding 
onset and not only within 3 h. Although we found no 
statistical heterogeneity in the interaction between 
treatment delay and the effect of tranexamic acid between 
trials, whether the physiology of bleeding varies by cause 
is open to question. Treatment delay might be under­
estimated in trauma, since many injuries are unwitnessed, 
and it might have been over­estimated in post­partum 
haemorrhage because time of birth was taken as the time 
of onset. Because of these uncertainties, we did sensitivity 
analyses with a range of plausible errors. Results of these 
analyses support the conclusion that prompt treatment is 
essential. Fourth, deaths due to bleeding and deaths from 
vascular occlusive events could have been misclassified.11,12 
Some deaths attributed to bleeding might have been due 
to thrombotic disseminated intravascular coagulation, 
especially those occurring several hours after onset. 
Although results adjusted for age and systolic blood 
pressure were similar, we cannot exclude the possibility 
that other unmeasured factors might have influenced the 
results. The large sample size—more than 40 000 patients 
with 
acute 
severe 
bleeding—provided 
a 
precise 
assessment of the effect of treatment delay with statistically 
significant results. All analyses were done on an intention­
to­treat basis and missing data were negligible.
Our findings indicate that even a short treatment delay 
reduces the survival benefit from tranexamic acid. With 
the exception of the first hour, we found a clear trend of 
decreasing effectiveness with increasing treatment delay.

The apparently lower treatment effect within the first hour 
might be due to random variability or limitations in timing 
the onset of bleeding (appendix). Alternatively, a larger 
proportion of patients treated within an hour of bleeding 
onset might have unsurvivable haemorrhage.30 Trauma

Figure 3: Effect of treatment delay on treatment benefit (model 3)
The red line shows the best fitted model for the association between the protective effect of tranexamic acid (odds ratio for not dying from bleeding) and duration of 
treatment delay in minutes (pslope<0·0001). The grey lines are the lower and upper bounds of the 95% CI for this model. Estimates are derived from a logistic 
regression model of not dying from bleeding explained by the interaction of getting tranexamic acid and treatment delay (linear and squared terms) and adjusted for 
trial, age (5-year intervals), and systolic blood pressure (10-mm Hg intervals). The white square shows the timepoint at which the model estimates a null effect of 
tranexamic acid (a treatment delay of 180 min). The black square shows the timepoint at which the lower 95% CI model estimates a null effect of tranexamic acid 
(a treatment delay of 135 min).

The bars represent the estimated treatment effectiveness (y-axis, estimated by [(OR at time t – 1)/(OR at t = 0 – 1) × 100] in %) at 5-min intervals of treatment delay. 
The bar highlighted in red shows the estimated treatment effectiveness (90%) with a treatment delay of 15 min.

to have penetrating injuries than those treated later 
(appendix). With regard to the decrease in treatment 
effectiveness with increasing delay, several hypotheses can 
be proposed. First, we should expect some time lag 
between administration of tranexamic acid and its effect 
on mortality. It is unlikely that deaths occurring very soon 
after tranexamic acid administration could have been 
prevented by tranexamic acid. However, their inclusion in 
the trial will bias (dilute) the treatment effect towards the 
null. Given the temporal distribution of deaths from 
bleeding shown in figure 2, the extent of this null bias 
would increase with increasing treatment delay. Second, 
the ability to form a clot depends on fibrinogen 
concentrations. In patients with trauma and post­partum 
haemorrhage, low serum fibrinogen is predictive of life 
threatening bleeding.31,32 Fibrinogen falls rapidly in severe 
bleeding because of its consumption during clot formation. 
However, fibrinolysis and fibrinogenolysis would increase 
the consumption of fibrinogen. Early tranexamic acid 
treatment should protect fibrinogen stores and maintain 
the ability to form a stable fibrin clot. Indeed, we should 
consider tranexamic acid as an intervention to prevent 
rather than treat coagulopathy. Further research into the 
mechanism of action of tranexamic acid in acute severe 
bleeding should improve our understanding of the 
observed time to treatment interaction.
These findings have various implications for clinical 
care. Bleeding patients should receive antifibrinolytics as 
soon as possible for three reasons. First, most deaths 
from haemorrhage occur within hours of bleeding onset. 
By reducing bleeding, tranexamic acid has the potential to 
prevent the hypoxia and acidosis that accompanies severe 
bleeding, but it must be given before tissue damage is 
irreversible. Second, the benefit of tranexamic acid 
treatment appears to decrease with increasing treatment 
delay. Third, we found no evidence of adverse effects 
associated with tranexamic acid treatment, so it can be 
given safely as soon as bleeding is suspected. Given the 
importance of early treatment, time from bleeding onset 
to treatment should be audited with feedback provided to 
health­care professionals. National or regional quality 
improvement initiatives, with best practice benchmarking 
of time to treatment, might improve survival.
We found nine ongoing trials of antifibrinolytics in 
acute severe bleeding. Two of these will provide additional 
data on the effect of treatment delay in severe extracranial 
bleeding. Because the data from these two trials will 
increase the number of participants by only 5%, it is 
unlikely that they will have a material effect on our 
conclusions. Nonetheless, ongoing trials should deepen 
our understanding of the safety and effectiveness of 
antifibrinolytics in traumatic and spontaneous intracranial 
bleeding, which are major causes of death and disability 
worldwide. Our review protocol also proposed an analysis 
of the extent to which the balance of benefits and harms of 
antifibrinolytic treatment vary with baseline risk. These 
results will be reported in a future publication.
