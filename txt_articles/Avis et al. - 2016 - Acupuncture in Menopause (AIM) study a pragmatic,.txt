Abstract
Objective—to evaluate the short- and long-term effects of acupuncture on vasomotor symptoms 
(VMS) and quality of life-related measures.
Methods—A total of 209 perimenopausal and postmenopausal women aged 45-60 experiencing 
≥4 VMS per day recruited from the community and randomized to receive up to 20 acupuncture 
treatments within the first 6 months (acupuncture group) or the second 6 months (waitlist control 
group) of the 12-month study period. The primary outcome was mean daily frequency of VMS. 
Secondary outcomes were VMS interference with daily life, sleep quality, depressive symptoms, 
somatic and other symptoms, anxiety, and quality of life.
Results—VMS frequency declined by 36.7% at 6 months in the acupuncture group and increased 
by 6.0% in the control group (p<0.001 for between-group comparison). At 12 months, the 
reduction from baseline in the acupuncture group was 29.4% (p<0.001 for within-group 
comparison from baseline to 12 months), suggesting that the reduction was largely maintained 
post treatment. Statistically significant clinical improvement was observed after 3 acupuncture 
treatments and maximum clinical effects occurred after a median of 8 treatments. Persistent 
improvements were seen in many quality of life-related outcomes in the acupuncture group 
relative to the control group.
Conclusions—We found that a course of acupuncture treatments was associated with significant 
reduction in VMS, as well as several quality of life measures, compared with no acupuncture, and 
that clinical benefit persisted for at least 6 months beyond the end of treatment.

 Keywords
menopause; acupuncture; vasomotor symptoms; hot flashes
Vasomotor symptoms (VMS), which include hot flashes and night sweats, are the most 
common and troubling symptoms associated with menopause.1,2 Although some women 
report experiencing the menopausal transition without any VMS,3 for other women, these 
symptoms can be frequent and severe and interfere with daily activities and quality of 
life.4-12 Recent estimates suggest that frequent menopausal VMS can continue for a median 
of 7.4 years.13 Further, VMS are the chief menopause-related problems for which US 
women seek medical attention.14-16
Estrogen therapy, alone or in combination with progesterone, is currently the most effective 
treatment of VMS. Hormone therapy (HT), however, is associated with a number of risks 
such as thromboembolic events and breast cancer, and some troublesome side effects such as 
breast tenderness and irregular bleeding.17-19,19-21 Many women seek alternatives such as 
other pharmaceutical agents, herbal or dietary remedies, or behavioral therapies.22-25 
Unfortunately, many of these agents also have side effects and/or have not been shown to be 
effective.24,26-29
A number of randomized controlled trials have shown that acupuncture can be effective at 
reducing the frequency and severity of VMS.30-35 A recent meta-analysis of 12 RCTs 
concluded that acupuncture improves VMS frequency and severity and menopause-related 
symptoms in women experiencing natural menopause, with clinical effects lasting up to 3 
months.36 However, there is a paucity of evidence about longer term effects of acupuncture, 
the effects of acupuncture on health-related quality of life, and optimal dosing strategies for 
acupuncture among women with VMS.
Although the mechanisms of hot flashes are not well understood, one possible cause is the 
reduction in β-endorphins in the hypothalamus resulting from low concentrations of 
estrogen. Theories of neurophysiological and neurohumoral mechanisms, as well as 
concepts of Traditional Chinese Medicine, suggest that acupuncture may be an effective 
method to control hot flashes through its effect on endorphins. Changes in level of β-
endorphins and other neurotransmitters affect the thermoregulatory center in the 
hypothalamus and acupuncture may alter these central neuromodulators.37-41
We conducted a pragmatic, randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of 
acupuncture for the treatment of menopause-related VMS. The purpose of this study was to 
provide an unbiased estimate of short- and medium-term clinical benefit or harms that a 
woman who is experiencing frequent VMS might expect from undergoing a course of 
acupuncture treatments, relative to not treating VMS with acupuncture.

 METHODS
Study Design Overview
This was a pragmatic 2-site, 2-arm clinical trial of perimenopausal and postmenopausal 
women experiencing an average of ≥4 VMS per day who were randomized to either: 1) a 6-
month course of up to 20 acupuncture treatments, or 2) a waitlist control group consisting of 
usual care for 6 months followed by the same 6-month course of acupuncture treatments 
administered to study participants in the intervention. Because our aim was to estimate the 
magnitude and nature of the effects of acupuncture relative to no acupuncture, and because 
sham acupuncture is neither physiologically inert nor available to patients outside the 
context of experimental, sham-controlled clinical trials, we did not use a sham acupuncture 
control. The rationale for this methodological approach is further justified in part by a recent 
meta-analysis of acupuncture for menopausal hot flashes that concluded that sham 
acupuncture could induce a treatment effect comparable to true acupuncture in the reduction 
of hot flash frequency.36
The trial aimed to generate an unbiased estimate of short- and medium-term clinical benefit 
or harms that a person with VMS might expect from undergoing a course of acupuncture 
treatments, relative to not treating VMS with acupuncture. Primary outcomes were 
frequency and severity of VMS assessed by daily diaries. Secondary outcomes included a 
variety of quality of life-related measures. The study was approved by the Wake Forest 
Health Sciences Institutional Review Boards for both sites. Recruitment occurred between 
April 2011-July 2013 at Wake Forest School of Medicine and Chapel Hill Doctors 
Healthcare Center in North Carolina. Follow-up continued through July 2014.
Study Participants
Eligible participants were perimenopausal or postmenopausal women aged 45-60 
experiencing ≥4 VMS/day. Perimenopause was defined as three or more months of self-
defined amenorrhea; postmenopause was defined as amenorrhea for 12 or more months.42 
Women who had a bilateral oophorectomy and/or hysterectomy prior to cessation of menses 
were classified as having surgical menopause. Exclusion criteria were: initiation or change 
in dose of any treatment for VMS in the last 4 weeks, initiation or change in dose of an 
antidepressant in the last 3 months, having received acupuncture for any indication in the 
prior 4 weeks or having received acupuncture from one of the study acupuncturists in the 
prior 6 months, self-reported health status as poor or fair on the telephone screener, or a 
diagnosis of hemophilia.
Procedures
Women were recruited through newspaper advertisements, radio announcements, and 
community postings. Initial eligibility was determined by a telephone screener. Eligible 
women were scheduled for a baseline study visit, at which time they were consented and 
completed a self-administered questionnaire and received instructions on keeping a 2-week 
hot flash diary (described under Measures), which was then mailed back to study personnel 
and used to verify eligibility.

 Following completion of the 2-week diary, all women who met the criteria of an average of 
≥4 VMS per day were scheduled for their first acupuncture treatment visit to occur within 
the following 3 weeks. At this visit, the acupuncturist provided a traditional Chinese 
medicine (TCM) diagnosis to obtain a baseline diagnosis on all women. Following 
diagnosis, acupuncturists logged into the study website and completed the randomization 
process to identify group assignment. Women randomized to the acupuncture group received 
their first treatment at that time. Control group participants were told that their first 
acupuncture treatment would be in 6 months.
All study participants returned for a study visit at 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months post 
randomization to complete study questionnaires, including an update of medications. 
Women were allowed to continue or initiate other treatments during this time. Eleven (6%) 
women in the acupuncture group and two women in the control group (5%) began other 
behavioral treatments (e.g., mindfulness, mindfulness, yoga) post randomization. Study staff 
who administered questionnaires were blinded as to group assignment. Study participants 
were paid $35 for their baseline visit and $25 for completion of each of the follow-up visits. 
Those who completed all 6 visits were paid an additional $50.
Randomization
Eligible women were randomized to one of the two groups, stratified by site and menopause 
status, using a block randomization with block size unknown to the investigators and staff to 
ensure balanced accrual to each group of the study. Randomization sequences were prepared 
at Wake Forest. Study participants were randomized using a 4:1 distribution to optimize 
statistical power for identifying possible clinical effects up to 6 months after completion of 
the 6-month treatment period for participants randomized to the intervention group.
Acupuncture Treatment
Participants assigned to acupuncture were allowed to have up to 20 acupuncture treatments 
by one of four study acupuncturists over a 6-month period. The frequency of treatments was 
determined by the acupuncturist and study participant. All study acupuncturists were 
licensed acupuncturists with 8 to 33 years of practice experience prior to the start of this 
clinical trial. Acupuncturists ascribed a primary TCM diagnosis and up to two secondary 
TCM pattern diagnoses to each study participant. Study acupuncturists elicited a symptom 
history from participants and conducted a physical exam that included pulse palpation and 
tongue inspection. Information from the history and physical examination informed 
participants’ diagnoses, which in turn informed acupuncture point selection and 
individualized treatment plans. TCM diagnoses were reassessed (and changed, if indicated) 
at each subsequent treatment session. Study acupuncturists were permitted to change 
acupuncture point selection and other aspects of treatment if clinically indicated at each 
treatment session.
Sterile, disposable acupuncture needles were inserted through the skin to a depth of from 
one-half to three centimeters based on anatomical location. Acupuncturists attempted to 
achieve a “de Qi” sensation upon insertion of acupuncture needles (a sensation of soreness, 
numbness, heaviness or distention around the needled acupuncture point) whenever possible.

 No restrictions were placed on duration of each treatment, or on the application of other 
treatment modalities such as moxibustion or manual or electrical stimulation of acupuncture 
needles at selected acupuncture point locations, but prescribing Chinese herbal remedies was 
not permitted.
Control Group
Participants in this group did not receive any form of acupuncture needling during the first 6 
months of study participation. Individualized TCM diagnoses and treatment plans were 
developed at that time based on participants’ clinical presentation at the time that they began 
their first acupuncture treatment.
Measures
The primary study outcome was the change in frequency and severity of hot flashes and 
night sweats as measured by the Daily Diary of Hot Flashes (DDHF). The DDHF records 
the frequency and severity (using a 4- point scale from mild to very severe) of each VMS 
and allows the investigator to calculate VMS frequency and a VMS index score (the sum of 
the number of VMS multiplied by each level of severity).43 Women were asked to record the 
number and severity of VMS each day during the treatment phase of the trial and were 
provided tally counters to help them keep track of the number of hot flashes throughout the 
day. Baseline VMS frequency and the index score were calculated using the last fourteen 
days of diaries available prior to randomization.
Secondary Outcomes
Secondary study outcomes included hot flash interference, sleep quality, menopause related 
symptoms, depressive symptoms, anxiety, perceived stress, and health-related quality of life.
Hot flash interference was assessed by Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale 
(HFRDIS) which measures the degree that hot flashes interfere with nine daily activities 
(work, social activities, leisure activities, sleep, mood, concentration, relation with others, 
sexuality, and enjoyment of life) and overall quality of life within the past week.44 Sleep was 
assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) 45 and the PROMIS short form 
Sleep Disturbance measure. The Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ) measures physical 
and emotional health of women aged 40 to 60 years and consists of 36 items covering 9 
domains: depressed mood, somatic symptoms, anxiety/fears, vasomotor symptoms, sleep 
problems, sexual behavior, menstrual symptoms, memory/concentration, and 
attractiveness .46 We excluded the domain of menstrual symptoms in analyses since this 
domain was not relevant to the vast majority of women in the study. Depressive symptoms 
were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale, short form 
(CESD-10).47 Anxiety symptoms were measured with the General Anxiety Disorder 
(GAD-7),48 and the PROMIS short form Anxiety. Perceived Stress was assessed by the 4-
item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS).49
Two measures of quality of life were included: a single global 100 mm visual analogue scale 
(VAS) and the Physical and Mental Health Component scores of the Medical Outcomes 
Study (MOS) 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36).50

 Covariates—Covariates included in analyses were previous use of acupuncture sometime 
in the past but still meeting eligibility requirements (yes/no), current use of HT (yes/no), 
menopause status (perimenopausal/naturally postmenopausal/surgical post), and season of 
randomization (winter/spring/summer/fall).
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics of baseline measures were reported, and the two study groups were 
compared using t-tests for continuous measures and chi-square tests for categorical 
measures. For the primary analysis comparing change in VMS between study groups, a 
repeated measures ANCOVA model was used. Included in the model were study group, time 
after randomization, interaction of study arm and time, baseline VMS frequency (or the 
Index score), season of randomization, site, acupuncture use prior to the study, use of HT, 
and baseline menopause status. Self-reported VMS data were collected daily and assigned a 
time variable used in the model. The time variable was defined as number of weeks after 
randomization. Least square means from the group by time interaction were estimated and 
plotted for a visual representation of the results of the study. Two group t-tests for 
differences of the least square means between groups were performed at 6 months and 12 
months to address the primary aims of the study. These t-tests were also performed within 
each study group to assess the difference from 6 months to 12 months. Additional 
exploratory tests were then done each week for the first 6 months and every 4 weeks from 6 
to 12 months. The same modeling approach was used to evaluate the Index (i.e. frequency × 
severity) and secondary outcomes. For the secondary outcomes, the time variable in models 
was defined as the time points of data collection (Months 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12). Using the 
models, tests for differences in study groups were done at Months 2, 6, and 12. During the 
treatment period for the acupuncture group, we report the median of the cumulative number 
of treatments received up to a given week. All analyses were done as intent-to-treat analysis 
and were performed using SAS version 9.4 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Participant data are shown in Figure 1. Of the 329 screener-eligible women, 272 completed 
an initial baseline study visit. Of these, 28 were subsequently determined ineligible based on 
too few VMS after their 2-week hot flash diary and 35 declined further participation. 209 
women were entered into the study and randomized. Study retention was excellent, with 
89% remaining in the study at 6 months and 84% at 12 months.
Sample characteristics
Sample characteristics by group assignment are shown in Table 1. There were no significant 
group differences in baseline characteristics. Participants had a mean number of 9.5 
(SD=5.0; median = 8.5) VMS/day at baseline. The majority of the sample (76%) was white; 
22% participants were African-American. The majority of participants (57%) were naturally 
postmenopausal and 27% had undergone a surgical menopause (38 women had a 
hysterectomy only or a hysterectomy with one ovary removed; 16 women had both ovaries 
removed; and 2 women had a hysterectomy, but did not know whether or not they had any 
ovaries removed). Twenty-four percent of women had received acupuncture at some point in

 the past. Two participants in the acupuncture group and no control participants were using 
hormone therapies at randomization..
Reduction of Vasomotor Symptoms
Percent change in total VMS frequency is shown in Figure 2 and Table 1. There was a 
significant group effect (p<0.001) with VMS frequency declining by 36.7% at 6 months in 
the acupuncture group and increasing by 6.0% in the control group. Week 3 was the first 
week where the percent change in VMS frequency was significantly different from controls 
(p=0.01), with decreases of 23.7% and 2.4% of baseline frequency in the acupuncture and 
control groups, respectively (Table 2). At 12 months, the reduction from baseline in the 
acupuncture group was 29.5% (p<0.001), suggesting that the reduction in VMS was largely 
maintained for 6 months after discontinuing acupuncture treatments. The control group 
began receiving treatments at 6 months; between 6 and 12 months, VMS frequency in this 
group decreased to 31.0% of baseline (p<0.001). Results of a sensitivity analysis that 
censored participant data at the time a participant started a new behavioral therapy were 
similar to the primary analysis (data not shown). Results for the VMS index score (Figure 3) 
are very similar to the effects seen in the VMS frequency analysis.
Figure 4 shows the median cumulative number of acupuncture treatments for the 
acupuncture group superimposed on Figure 2 with the control group removed. As seen in 
this figure, the maximum reduction in hot flashes occurred at Week 7, which corresponds to 
a median of 8 acupuncture treatments. Following Week 8, the median cumulative number of 
treatments continued to increase to a median of 18 at week 26, whereas the percent change 
in VMS frequency did not. The control group used a median of 16 treatments during their 
treatment period (months 6 to 12).
Secondary Outcomes
At the 6-month follow-up, the acupuncture group was 19 points lower than the controls on 
the hot flash interference scale in adjusted analyses (p<0.001). Participants in the 
acupuncture group also reported significantly fewer sleep problems on all three measures: 
the Pittsburgh sleep score; sleep domain of the WHQ; and PROMIS sleep measure as 
compared to women in the control group (Table 3, Figure 5). Women in the acupuncture 
group also reported significantly fewer symptoms on the WHQ: vasomotor, anxiety, somatic 
symptoms, and memory. At 12 months, the effects of acupuncture were maintained in the 
acupuncture group for all of these outcomes. The control group showed similar improvement 
on these outcomes and in addition, had reduced depressive symptoms from 6 to 12 months.
DISCUSSION
The findings from this study support previous research showing a significant effect of 
acupuncture on VMS reduction,30-36 with a sustained effect lasting 6 months after the end of 
treatment. Acupuncture had a significant positive effect on hot flash interference, sleep, 
somatic and memory symptoms, and anxiety and these benefits were maintained 6 months 
following the end of treatment. Other studies have also found beneficial effects on similar 
outcomes for shorter periods of time.36 However, it is not clear from our study, as well as 
Avis et al.

 those of others, whether the benefits on sleep and other symptoms are direct effects of 
acupuncture or secondary to the reduction of vasomotor symptoms. This study also goes 
beyond previous research by including a longer post-treatment follow-up than most 
studies.32,33,35
Our findings provide information that can be used to estimate the number of weeks and 
treatments needed for acupuncture to be effective. We found that a statistically significant 
reduction in VMS frequency in the acupuncture group relative to controls was observed 
during the third week of acupuncture treatments, which represents fewer treatments than the 
number of treatments used in previous trials with predetermined treatment 
schedules.30-35,51,52 We also found that maximum reduction in VMS frequency occurred 
after 7 weeks of treatment, corresponding to a median of 8 treatments. It is important to note 
that this study was not designed to formally compare different doses of acupuncture, and 
that unmeasured confounders may have biased these estimates. For example, it is possible 
that women who experienced relief of symptoms after one or two treatments may have been 
more likely to schedule their third or fourth treatment sooner. It is also possible that certain 
patient characteristics influenced acupuncturists’ treatment decisions. These unknown and 
unmeasured potential confounders in our study are likely to be similarly present in clinical 
practice.
It is worth comparing our results to studies of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) 
and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), which have been viewed as 
viable alternatives to hormone therapy. The Menopause Strategies: Finding Lasting Answers 
for Symptoms and Health (MsFLASH) network found a 47% reduction in VMS from 
baseline with escitalopram (compared to 33% in the placebo group),53 but that one-third of 
women whose VMS had improved relapsed within 3 weeks after discontinuation of 
escitalopram.54 MsFLASH also found a 47.6% reduction from baseline in VMS frequency 
with venlafaxine, but did not look at effects post treatment.55 A recent systematic review 
concluded that although venlafaxine was shown to provide beneficial effects on reducing 
VMS, trials have also reported significant adverse effects.56 In the present study, only three 
women reported adverse effects: two reported pain during treatment and one reported a 
feeling of numbness. Another review concluded that paroxetine, which is the only SSRI 
approved by the FDA for VMS, had the highest probability for reducing VMS.57 Both 
reviews conclude that, while effective for reducing VMS, both SSRIs and SNRIs can have 
adverse side effects. Although the 35% reduction in hot flash frequency observed in our 
study was less than in these trials, the low adverse event rate of 1.4% suggests that 
acupuncture is safe, and persistent clinical benefits were observed up to the final follow-up 
assessment 6 months after end of treatments.
Strengths of this current study include the simulation of clinical practice where 
acupuncturists were allowed to individualize treatment and participants experienced a course 
of acupuncture treatments that was similar to what they might expect outside of the context 
of a clinical trial. The study had good retention of participants and spanned all seasons to 
avoid seasonal effects of hot flashes. A limitation of the study is the potential unreliability 
and risk of bias associated with self-reporting of VMS, despite the fact that daily diaries 
represent the standard outcome measure used in most clinical trials of VMS treatment

 studies. It is also possible that women who perceived little benefit from acupuncture were 
more likely to drop out of the study. In addition, although we did not find an additional 
benefit beyond 8 acupuncture treatments, it is possible that the additional treatments helped 
to provide a maintenance effect.
The present study was designed to simulate clinical practice in community settings where 
the number, frequency, and timing of acupuncture treatments are allowed to vary according 
to acupuncturists' recommendations and patients’ preferences. Our study design reflects the 
priorities proposed by comparative effectiveness researchers who argue that pragmatic or 
effectiveness trials with good external validity are generally better suited to inform clinical 
practice than efficacy trials with good internal validity. For example, our study design meets 
criteria for 7 of the 10 domains identified by the pragmatic-explanatory continuum indicator 
summary (PRECIS) assessment tool58 as being important for effectiveness trials: 1) broad 
patient eligibility criteria; 2) experimental intervention flexibility; 3) experimental 
intervention practitioner expertise with “only ordinary attention to dose setting”; 4) usual 
practice for a comparison intervention; 5) primary trial outcomes that are meaningful to 
study participants; 6) no obtrusive measurement of participant compliance; 7) no obtrusive 
measurement of practitioner adherence to study protocol; and 8) analysis of primary 
outcomes “to see if the treatment works under the usual conditions, with all of the noise 
inherent.” A similar set of domains has been proposed by a different group of comparative 
effectiveness researchers who developed a tool to distinguish efficacy from effectiveness 
studies.59 An important feature of both of these tools is their emphasis on not using placebo- 
or sham-controlled comparison groups. The movement away from the use of placebo or 
sham control groups is a defining feature of the emerging field of comparative effectiveness 
research, which generally strives to prioritize answering the question, “Can this intervention 
work under usual conditions?” (effectiveness studies) rather than “Does this intervention 
work under ideal conditions?” (efficacy studies).58
Movement towards conducting more pragmatic clinical studies without placebo controls 
notwithstanding, the fact that we did not include a sham acupuncture procedure as a control 
group precludes knowing to what extent nonspecific effects may have contributed to the 
observed clinical response reported by study participants. It is possible that most, or even all, 
of the clinical benefits observed by participants who received acupuncture relative to those 
in the waitlist group are attributable to patients’ expectations of benefit, or the additional 
care and attention that they received by healthcare providers, or other factors not directly 
related to physiological responses to the insertion of acupuncture needles. It is also possible 
that the sustained reduction in hot flash frequency and improvement in quality of life related 
measures after completion of the course of acupuncture treatments are attributable to 
nonspecific effects. The purpose of this study, however, was not to estimate the magnitude of 
specific effects associated with acupuncture, but, rather, to estimate the magnitude of clinical 
benefit (and harms) that women with frequent hot flashes might expect from a course of 
acupuncture treatments. The findings from our study, combined with the findings from prior 
research, provides compelling evidence that a course of acupuncture treatments can reduce 
hot flash frequency and severity and can improve health-related quality of life. Future 
research can explore the mechanisms of action and the relative contributions of specific and 
nonspecific effects of acupuncture for this clinical condition.

 CONCLUSIONS
Acupuncture as practiced in clinical settings can have a positive benefit on reducing hot 
flashes and improving sleep and other symptoms relative to no acupuncture. The clinical 
benefits are observed after just a few acupuncture treatments and appear to persist for many 
months after acupuncture treatments have been discontinued.

PROMIS, Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (t-score rescales raw score into a standardized score with mean=50 and 
standard deviation=10); PCS = Physical Component Summary; MCS = Mental Component Summary.
aValues for initial visit are raw group means (standard error). T-tests were used for comparison between groups.
bValues for other visits are lsmean (standard error). P-values are for difference between treatment arms at given time point. These are results from a 
repeated measures ANCOVA model adjusting for baseline value, site, acupuncture use prior to the study, use of hormone therapy medications, and 
baseline menopause status.
