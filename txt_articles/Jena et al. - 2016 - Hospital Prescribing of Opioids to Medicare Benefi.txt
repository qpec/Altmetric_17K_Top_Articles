Abstract
 IMPORTANCE—Use of opioids during and shortly after an acute hospitalization is warranted 
in some clinical settings. However, given the potential of opioids for short-term adverse events and 
long-term physiologic tolerance, it is important to understand the frequency of opioid prescribing 
at hospital discharge, hospital variation, and patient and hospital factors associated with opioid 
prescribing, which is currently unknown in the United States.
 OBJECTIVE—To estimate the frequency of opioid prescribing at hospital discharge among 
Medicare beneficiaries without an opioid prescription claim 60 days prior to hospitalization; to 
document hospital variation in prescribing; and to analyze patient and hospital factors associated 
with prescribing, including hospital average performance on pain-related Hospital Consumer 
Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) measures.
 DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—Analysis of pharmacy claims of a 20% 
random sample of Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized in 2011 without an opioid prescription 
claim in the 60 days before hospitalization.
 MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Our main outcome was a new opioid claim within 
7 days of hospital discharge. We estimated a multivariable linear probability model of patient 
factors associated with new opioid use and described hospital variation in adjusted rates of new

 opioid use. In multivariable linear regression analysis, we also analyzed hospital factors associated 
with average adjusted new opioid use at the hospital level, including the percentage of each 
hospital’s patients who reported that their pain during hospitalization was always well controlled 
in the 2011 HCAHPS surveys.
 RESULTS—Among 623 957 hospitalizations, 92 882 (14.9%) were associated with a new 
opioid claim. Among those hospitalizations with an associated opioid claim within 7 days of 
hospital discharge, 32 731 (42.5%) of 77 092 were associated with an opioid claim after 90 days 
postdischarge. Across 2512 hospitals, the average adjusted rate of new opioid use within 7 days of 
hospitalization was 15.1% (interquartile range, 12.3%–17.4%; interdecile range, 10.5%–20.0%). A 
hospital’s adjusted rate of new opioid use was modestly positively associated with the percentage 
of its inpatients reporting that their pain was always well managed (increase from 25th to the 75th 
percentile in the HCAHPS measure was associated with an absolute increase in new opioid use of 
0.89 percentage points or a relative increase of 6.0%; P < .001).
 CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—New opioid use after hospitalization is common 
among Medicare beneficiaries, with substantial variation across hospitals and a large proportion of 
patients using a prescription opioid 90 days after hospitalization. The degree to which observed 
hospital variation in short- and longer-term opioid use reflects variation in inappropriate 
prescribing at hospital discharge is unknown.
Prescribing of opioids at the time of discharge from an acute hospitalization represents an 
important but underdescribed potential avenue through which previously opioid-naïve 
patients may develop long-term use.1–3 Use of opioids during and shortly after 
hospitalization is warranted in many clinical settings, for example, in patients with 
orthopedic injuries, those undergoing surgery, and those receiving palliative care. Failure to 
appropriately manage pain in these settings may adversely affect patient quality of life, delay 
discharge from the hospital, and in cases of surgery lead to interferences in postoperative 
rehabilitation and chronic postsurgical pain.4–7 However, prescribing of opioids is also 
associated with both short- and long-term risks including physical dependence. Adverse 
effects of opioid use are of particular concern given that deaths attributable to prescription 
opioids more than tripled in the United States during the 1999–2014 period.8
Limited evidence exists on prescribing of opioids at hospital discharge. Among opioid-naïve 
patients undergoing low-risk surgery in Ontario, Canada, 7% received opioids within 1 week 
of hospital discharge, and these patients were 44% more likely to use opioids long-term than 
patients who were not prescribed opioids in the first week postdischarge.1 In another 
Ontario-based study of patients undergoing major elective surgery, 49% of patients filled a 
prescription for an opioid after discharge and 3% continued to receive opioids after 90 days.2 
In an analysis of opioid-naïve patients discharged at a US safety net hospital in 2011, 25% 
of patients were prescribed an opioid at discharge; the risk of opioid use 1 year later was 4-
fold higher among patients with opioid receipt than among those without opioid receipt.3
The extent to which opioids are prescribed at hospital discharge, variation in prescribing 
across hospitals, and patient and hospital factors associated with opioid prescribing are 
unknown in the United States. Moreover, US hospitals are both measured and financially 
incentivized on the basis of patient satisfaction with hospital care through the Hospital

 Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) initiative, an 
important domain of which includes patient perceptions of the quality of pain care while 
hospitalized.9 The possibility that this measure could incentivize both greater inpatient use 
of opioids and the prescribing of opioids at hospital discharge has been suggested in recently 
proposed legislation, the Promoting Responsible Opioid Prescribing Act of 2016,10 but the 
association between opioid prescribing rates at hospital discharge and hospital performance 
on pain-related HCAHPS measures has not been investigated.
Using data on prescription drug claims of a national random sample of Medicare 
beneficiaries who were hospitalized in 2011 and did not have a prescription claim for an 
opioid in the 60 days prior to hospitalization, we estimated the frequency with which 
individuals filled a prescription for an opioid within 1 week of hospital discharge, described 
variation across hospitals in rates of postdischarge prescription opioid use, and analyzed 
patient and hospital factors associated with postdischarge opioid use.
Key Points
Question
How much do hospitals vary in opioid prescribing at hospital discharge, and what patient 
and hospital factors are associated with prescribing?
Findings
In this observational study of Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized in 2011 without an 
opioid claim in the 60 days before hospitalization, 14.9% of discharges involved a new 
opioid claim within 7 days of discharge. A hospital’s adjusted rate of new opioid use was 
modestly positively associated with the hospital’s average performance on pain-related 
Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems measures.
Meaning
New opioid use after hospitalization is common among Medicare beneficiaries, with 
substantial variation across hospitals.
 Methods
This study was exempted from ethical review of studies with human participants by the 
University of Southern California.
 Study Population
We identified acute short-stay hospitalizations of Medicare beneficiaries using the Centers 
for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) MEDPAR (Medicare Provider Analysis and 
Review) hospital discharge data files for a 20% random sample of beneficiaries in 2011. 
MEDPAR files contain information on each acute hospital stay, including admission and 
discharge dates, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision procedure and 
diagnosis codes, diagnosis-related group (DRG) codes, and hospital identity.

 Because we were interested in measuring prescription opioid use of patients before and after 
hospitalization, we limited our analyses to discharges of beneficiaries who had 12 months of 
continuous Medicare Part D enrollment (N = 1 511 335 discharges). Because not all 
Medicare beneficiaries obtain drug coverage through the Part D program, our sample was 
representative of the Part D population, not Medicare overall. We excluded Medicare 
Advantage enrollees because not all hospitals submit claims to CMS for these patients.11 
Our study population, therefore, included discharges of Medicare fee for- service 
beneficiaries (n = 1 055 759). We required beneficiaries with a January or February 2011 
discharge date to have Part D enrollment in 2010 because we needed to identify opioid use 
in a 60-day period before hospitalization (n = 1 042 120).
We merged discharges to American Hospital Association Annual Survey data that includes 
comprehensive information on US hospitals. We excluded 4866 discharges from hospitals 
with missing hospital identity, 1271 discharges from hospitals outside the United States, 11 
478 discharges from hospitals that were not general medical or surgical hospitals, and 491 
discharges from federal government hospitals. The resulting sample included 1 023 994 
discharges. Finally, to identify new opioid use, we focused on hospitalized beneficiaries who 
did not fill a prescription for an opioid in the 60 days prior to the index hospitalization 
admission date (final sample, n = 623 957). A flow diagram of sample construction is 
provided in eFigure 1 in the Supplement.
We linked each discharge with beneficiary data from the Beneficiary Annual Summary 
Files, including age, sex, race (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, Asian, 
other including North American native), metropolitan residence, and 5-digit zip code of 
residence. Additional beneficiary data included whether a beneficiary received a low income 
subsidy or received dual insurance coverage by Medicaid and Medicare at least 1 month of 
the year. Beneficiary files also included indicators of major comorbid conditions (Table 1).
 Outcomes
Our primary outcome was whether a beneficiary filled a prescription for an opioid within 7 
days of hospital discharge(“new opioid use postdischarge”). We also considered several 
secondary outcomes. First, to assess longer-term use, we identified discharges with at least a 
90-day follow-up and identified those in which the patient filled an opioid after 90 days of 
discharge. Second, to analyze dosing differences across hospitals, we analyzed the 
proportion of discharges in which new opioid use within 7 days of hospital discharge was 20 
morphine equivalents per day or higher. Third, to analyze how duration of opioid prescribing 
varied across hospitals, we analyzed the proportion of discharges in which new opioid use 
within 7 days of hospital discharge exceeded a 7-day supply. Finally, because our data did 
not specifically allow us to determine whether an opioid was prescribed at hospital discharge 
or shortly thereafter in the outpatient setting, we analyzed the proportion of discharges in 
which a new opioid prescription was filled within 3 days of discharge, assuming that such 
opioid use reflected filling of a prescription written at hospital discharge. We identified 
prescription opioids according to National Drug Code (complete, partial, and combination 
opioid agonists were included).

  Statistical Analysis
We first computed the proportion of hospitalizations in which a new prescription opioid was 
filled within 7 days of hospital discharge and the proportion of hospitalizations in which a 
new prescription opioid continued to be used after 90 days postdischarge. We next estimated 
a multivariable, discharge-level linear probability model to study patient level factors 
associated with new opioid use. The dependent variable was a binary outcome for whether a 
discharge involved a new prescription opioid claim within 7 days of discharge. Independent 
variables included patient characteristics, indicators for each of 585 DRGs, and hospital 
indicators. Patient characteristics included age, sex, race, Medicare-Medicaid dual eligibility 
and low-income subsidy for at least 1 month during the year, metropolitan residence 
indicator, indicators for each of 23 comorbid conditions, and patient 5-digit zip code median 
income. We reported changes in the adjusted probability of new prescription opioid use 
associated with each independent variable, with the exception of DRG given the large 
number of DRG variables. For categorical and binary variables, our estimates represented 
the difference in the probability of new opioid use for the corresponding category relative to 
the reference category (set at 0 for binary variables). To facilitate comparisons of how new 
opioid use was related to specific reasons for hospitalization, we reestimated the model 
replacing DRG indicators with medical and surgical major diagnostic categories (MDCs). 
These categories are formed by dividing all possible principal diagnoses into 25 mutually 
exclusive diagnosis areas. We further subdivided each MDC into surgical vs medical reason 
for hospitalization.
After analyzing patient-level predictors of new opioid use, we described hospital variation in 
adjusted rates of new opioid use. Using estimates from the multivariable model described 
above that included DRG, we predicted adjusted rates of new opioid use for each hospital, 
holding patient characteristics at their sample mean. We reported the distribution in adjusted 
rates of new opioid use by hospital for both primary and secondary measures of opioid use.
Finally, we analyzed hospital-level factors associated with new postdischarge opioid use by 
estimating a hospital level multivariable linear regression of patient risk-adjusted rates of 
postdischarge opioid use as a function of hospital characteristics, including number of beds, 
staffing (number of attending physicians, residents, registered nurses, each per bed), for-
profit status, system affiliation, teaching hospital status, rural status, and presence of an 
electronic health record. In addition, we included an independent variable from the 2011 
HCAHPS survey on the percentage of patients reporting that their pain during 
hospitalization was always well controlled.12 We restricted our analysis to hospitals with at 
least 50 discharges in 2011 and weighted regressions by the number of observations per 
hospital. Analyses were performed for both primary and secondary measures of opioid use.
Analyses were conducted using Stata software, version 14 (StataCorp LP). The 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) around reported means reflects 0.025 in each tail or P ≤ .05.
 Results
Our sample included 623 957 hospitalizations with no opioid claim in the 60 days prior to 
hospital admission. Overall, 92 882 (14.9%) were associated with a new opioid claim within

 7 days of discharge (Table 1). Among 77 092 of these 92 882 hospitalizations with 90-day 
follow-up, 32 731 (42.5%) were associated with an opioid claim after 90 days postdischarge.
While most new opioid use after hospital discharge was among beneficiaries 65 years or 
older, 8.2% of discharges with new opioid use involved beneficiaries younger than 45 years 
(Table 1). Most beneficiaries with new opioid use were female (57.9%). Non-Hispanic white 
and non-Hispanic black or African American beneficiaries accounted for 80.5% and 12.8% 
of the discharges, respectively. Overall, 41.7% of discharges with new opioid use involved 
beneficiaries who were dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. The most common 
comorbid conditions of beneficiaries with new opioid use postdischarge included 
hypertension (82.7%), hyperlipidemia (65%), anemia (55.7%), rheumatoid arthritis (49.4%), 
ischemic heart disease (49.3%), diabetes (40.2%), depression (31.5%), and congestive heart 
failure (30.4%).
 Patient Factors Associated With New Postdischarge Opioid Use
After multivariable adjustment, new postdischarge opioid use was more common among 
younger beneficiaries (Table 2). For example, the unadjusted percentage of new opioid use 
for beneficiaries 85 years or older was 6.0%. Relative to these beneficiaries, the adjusted 
percentage of new opioid use was higher by 1.9 percentage points (95% CI, 1.7–2.2) for 
those aged 74 to 84 years, and by 6.8 percentage points (95% CI, 6.6–7.1) for those aged 65 
to 74 years. Differences in new opioid use were not present according to patient race. New 
opioid use was more likely among beneficiaries who resided in rural areas, received low-
income subsidies, or were dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. Surgical 
hospitalizations were more likely to be associated with new postdischarge opioid use, and 
among these, diseases of the hepatobiliary system and pancreas, digestive system, female 
reproductive system, and surgery related to burns had the largest associations (eTable 1 in 
the Supplement). Among medical hospitalizations, diseases of the musculoskeletal system 
and connective tissue (eg, nonoperative management of fractures) had among the largest 
associations with new opioid use after hospitalization. Similar relationships were observed 
in opioid use 90 days after hospital discharge (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
 Hospital Variation in Opioid Use Postdischarge
New postdischarge opioid use varied across hospitals (Figure). Across 2507 hospitals, the 
average adjusted rate of new postdischarge opioid use was 15.1% (interquartile range, 
12.3%–17.4%; interdecile range, 10.5%–20.0%). Similar variation was observed when we 
restricted analysis to new opioid prescriptions filled within 3 days of hospitalization (eFigure 
2 in the Supplement). Among patients with new opioid use within 7 days of hospital 
discharge, large variation was also observed in opioid use 90 days postdischarge (eFigure 3 
in the Supplement). Finally, large variation was observed across hospitals in the proportion 
of discharges in which new opioid use within 7 days of hospital discharge was 20 morphine 
equivalents per day or higher (eFigure 4 in the Supplement) and in which new opioid use 
exceeded a 7-day supply (eFigure 5 in the Supplement).

  Hospital Factors Associated With New Opioid Use After Discharge
Hospital characteristics are described in eTable 3 in the Supplement. A hospital’s adjusted 
rate of new postdischarge opioid use was positively associated with its HCAHPS measure of 
the percentage of inpatients reporting that their pain was always well managed during 
hospitalization (Table 3). An increase from the 25th to the 75th percentile of the HCAHPS 
measure (from 66% to 71% of patients reporting their pain was always well managed, a 5 
percentage-point increase) was associated with an absolute increase in new postdischarge 
opioid use of 0.89 percentage points (P < .001). This represents a relative increase of 6.0% 
over the average hospital’s percentage of new opioid use after discharge (from 15.1% to 
16.0% of hospitalizations). Similar relationships were observed for our secondary opioid use 
measures (eTables 4 and 5 in the Supplement). For example, an increase from the 25th to the 
75th percentile of the HCAHPS measure was associated with a 0.86 percentage point 
absolute increase (7.1% relative increase compared with baseline of 12.2%) in the 
proportion of patients with an opioid claim within 7 days of discharge that was 20 morphine 
equivalents per day or higher (eTable 5 in the Supplement). New postdischarge opioid use 
was positively associated with the number of full-time registered nurses per bed and 
negatively associated with the number full-time resident physicians per bed. Government, 
rural, and system affiliated hospitals had higher adjusted rates of new postdischarge opioid 
use.
 Discussion
Analyzing prescription drug claims of a national random sample of Medicare beneficiaries 
who were hospitalized in 2011 and who were not prescribed an opioid within the60days 
prior to hospitalization, we found that approximately 15% of beneficiaries filled a new 
prescription for an opioid within 7 days of discharge and that the likelihood of postdischarge 
use varied across hospitals. For example, in the bottom decile of hospitals in terms of 
adjusted postdischarge opioid use, 10.5%of beneficiaries filled a new opioid prescription 
within 7 days of discharge, compared with 20.0% in the top decile of hospitals. Moreover, 
among beneficiaries with new opioid use within 7 days of discharge, 42.5%filled an opioid 
claim after 90 days postdischarge. We also found that hospitals that ranked more highly in 
terms of HCAHPS assessment of the quality of inpatient pain control had modestly higher 
rates of new postdischarge opioid use.
The prescribing of opioids during and after hospitalization is warranted in many clinical 
settings. Although we identified substantial variation across hospitals in new postdischarge 
opioid use, it is unknown whether this variation reflects differences in appropriate or 
inappropriate prescribing across hospitals. Distinguishing between these 2 possibilities is 
important, however, given that opioid prescribing at hospital discharge has in some settings 
been associated with increased risk of long-term use.1–3 Appropriate differences across 
hospitals in new postdischarge opioid use may stem from differences in average pain 
severity across hospitals or differences in the case mix of hospitalizations, which we 
attempted to account for through adjustment with DRG codes. In contrast, inappropriate 
differences across hospitals in new postdischarge opioid use may stem from systematic 
differences in practice patterns, which may be related to prescribing culture, other hospital

 characteristics, or possibly pay-for-performance measures related to the quality of inpatient 
pain management.13–16
Our finding that patients in the top decile of hospitals were twice as likely to fill a 
prescription for an opioid within 7 days of hospital discharge as patients in the bottom decile 
suggests that appropriate reasons for these observed differences, while important, may not 
fully explain the gap.
Our finding of a positive hospital-level relationship between HCAHP Spain management 
scores and the likelihood of postdischarge opioid use should be interpreted with caution. 
First, many patient, hospital, and regional factors may confound this relationship despite our 
attempts to account for patient characteristics and other hospital-level factors. For example, 
hospital performance on cultural competency measures is positively associated with 
performance on pain-related HCAHPSmeasures,17 implying that differences in cultural 
competency across hospitals may explain variation in opioid prescribing rather than hospital 
responses to pay-for-performance incentives. Second, our estimated associations were 
modest in size, suggesting that proposals to reduce hospital pay-for-performance incentives 
regarding inpatient pain management are unlikely to have large effects on opioid use.
Our findings could suggest that current outcome measurements of the adequacy of pain 
control should be coupled with process measurements on the appropriateness of opioid use 
or, put differently, that a central limitation of current pain satisfaction measures is their 
inability to account for appropriateness. To the extent that prescribing of opioids at discharge 
is aberrantly high in some hospitals, further detailed inquiry may be warranted into the 
appropriateness of this prescribing and whether opioid-prescribing rates could be safely 
reduced in those hospitals.
Our study had several limitations. First, we could not determine whether observed variation 
in opioid use after hospital discharge was related to appropriate or inappropriate prescribing 
variation. Second, given only 1 year of data, we could not study whether hospitals with 
higher adjusted rates of postdischarge opioid use had greater adverse events related to 
opioids, though many studies demonstrate links between opioid use and adverse opioid-
related outcomes.18–22 Third, we focused on the Medicare population, specifically 
beneficiaries under fee-for-service. Medicare is an important population to consider, 
however, given that opioid use among the elderly and disabled is associated with higher 
mortality and other adverse outcomes.18,23,24 Fourth, although we found that postdischarge 
prescription opioid use was positively associated with hospital performance on HCAHPS 
pain measures, this association was not only modest in size but may have been confounded 
by unobserved hospital or population characteristics. Fifth, our primary outcome was opioid 
use within 7 days of a hospitalization. It is possible that this may reflect outpatient 
prescribing of opioids rather than opioids prescribed at the time of hospital discharge. Our 
findings, however, were unaffected by a narrower window of 3 days postdischarge.

  Conclusions
Among Medicare patients without opioid use in the 60 days prior to hospitalization, 
prescribing of opioids at the time of hospital discharge is common, with substantial variation 
across hospitals and a large proportion of patients using a prescription opioid 90 days after 
hospitalization. The degree to which observed variation in postdischarge opioid use reflects 
inappropriate prescribing is unknown.

 Figure. Hospital Variation in Adjusted Rate of New Opioid Use Within 7 Days of Hospital 
Discharge
Adjusted rates of new opioid use were estimated among 2507 hospitals with at least 50 
discharges in 2011. The average adjusted rate of new opioid use within 7 days of hospital 
discharge was 15.1%, with an interquartile range of 12.3% (25th percentile) to 17.4%(75th 
percentile) and an interdecile range of 10.5.% (10th percentile) to 20.0%(90th percentile).

aTable reports estimates of a multivariable, discharge-level linear probability model of patient-level factors associated with a new opioid claim after 
discharge. The dependent variable was a binary outcome variable for whether a discharge involved a new prescription opioid claim within 7 days of 
discharge. Independent variables included patient characteristics, indicators for diagnosis-related group, and indicators for hospitals. Patient 
characteristics included age, sex, race, binary indicators for Medicare-Medicaid dual eligibility and low-income subsidy for at least 1 month during 
the year, binary indicator for metropolitan residence, indicator variables for comorbid conditions (reference category, not having the comorbid 
condition), and 5-digit patient zip code median income. Table reports changes in the adjusted absolute percentage point change in new prescription 
opioid use postdischarge associated with each independent variable.

aTable presents estimates from a hospital-level multivariable linear regression of patient risk-adjusted rates of hospital opioid use (adjusted for 
patient characteristics in Table 2) as a function of hospital characteristics, including number of beds, staffing (number of attending physicians, 
residents, registered nurses, each per bed), for-profit status, system affiliation (yes/no), teaching hospital status (yes/no), rural status, presence of an 
electronic health record, and an independent variable from the 2011 HCAHPS survey on the percentage of patients reporting that their pain during 
hospitalization was always well controlled. Analyses were restricted to 2507 hospitals with at least 50 discharges in 2011 and weighted by the 
number of observations per hospital.
bA 5-percentage-point increase in the HCAHPS measure corresponds to an increase from the 25th to 75th percentile of hospital scores (from 
66%to 71% of patients reporting that their pain was always well managed).
