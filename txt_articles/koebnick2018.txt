Pediatric practice guidelines call for repeating an elevated office blood pressure (BP) 
at the same visit, but there are few data available to support this recommendation. We 
compared the visit results in children aged 3 to 17 years with a BP reading ≥95th per‐
centile (n = 186 732) based on the initial BP and the mean of two BP readings, using 
electronic medical records from 2012–2015. Failure to repeat an initial BP read‐
ing ≥95th percentile would lead to a false “hypertensive” visit result in 54.1% of chil‐
dren who would require follow- 
up visits. After an initial visit result indicating 
hypertension, hypertension stage I or stage II was sustained in 2.3% and 11.3% of 
youth during their next visits, respectively. In conclusion, only approximately half of 
the pediatric patients would be correctly classified based on their initial BP. The rec‐
ommendation to repeat high BP during the same visit needs to be emphasized because 
it saves unnecessary follow- 
up visits.
1 | INTRODUCTION
High blood pressure (BP) is a major contributing risk factor for heart 
failure, heart attack, stroke, and chronic kidney disease and accounts 
for an estimated 18% of cardiovascular deaths in the United States.1 
High BP is not limited to adults. It is estimated that 4% to 5% of youth 
have hypertension, and another 13% to 18% of youth have prehyper‐
tension.2–8 Children with elevated BP are 2 to 3 times more likely to 
develop essential hypertension in young adulthood.9 Approximately 
30% to 40% of youth with sustained hypertension show early signs 
of end organ damage.10,11 Youth with cardiovascular risk developing 
early in life will face higher rates of cardiovascular morbidity and early 
death.12 Therefore, screening for high BP in asymptomatic youth is 
recommended as an important strategy for early diagnosis and treat‐
ment of hypertension to prevent cardiovascular disease.13–19
While routine medical visits offer a good opportunity to screen for 
high BP in asymptomatic youth,19 the adherence to current BP screen‐
ing guidelines is poor. Nationally representative data have shown that 
BP is not measured in two thirds of all pediatric visits and one third of 
pediatric preventive visits.20 When BP is measured, hypertension is 
often overlooked and underdiagnosed in pediatric populations until 
they transition to adult care.21,22
Initial BP readings can be high for various reasons including mea‐
surement error. Hence, BP readings should be repeated during the 
same visit and the mean of BP readings used as the visit result.19 
Repeating a high BP during the same visit can prevent misclassifica‐
tion of a patient’s visit result. This has implications for clinical practice 
because it is recommended that follow- 
up visits should be scheduled 
after a visit with a BP ≥95th percentile to confirm or rule out hyper‐
tension. Misclassification of a patient’s visit result as hypertensive may 
result in unnecessary follow- 
up visits, which are a burden for both the 
patient and the healthcare system. However, studies are needed to 
quantify the magnitude of misclassification arising from the failure to 
repeat an initial high BP reading.
To estimate the benefit of adhering to standardized protocols for 
BP screening as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics 
and others,15–19 we assessed the misclassification of pediatric pa‐
tients as hypertensive based on an initial BP reading, which could be 
avoided by a repeated reading during the same visit. The classification 
of an individual’s BP as normotensive or hypertensive during the same

visit was assessed based on: (1) the initial BP, (2) the mean of two 
BP readings, and (3) the lower of two BP readings. We also examined 
the occurrence of follow- 
up visits after an initial office visit with any 
hypertensive BP and the proportion of youth with sustained hyper‐
tension if follow- 
up visits were completed as recommended by the 
American Academy of Pediatrics and others.15–19
2 | PATIENTS AND METHODS
2.1 | Study setting and population
The Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) Children’s 
Health Study includes children and adolescents who are actively 
enrolled in a KPSC health plan in 2007 or later. It is an ongoing 
cohort study that continuously enrolls new patients who reaching 
the target age range or join the health plan.23 In 2010, KPSC mem‐
bers represented approximately 16.2% of the total coverage area 
population.24 The cohort follow- 
up is conducted through passive 
surveillance of clinical care information using an electronic medical 
record (EMR) system. All administrative and clinical data are linked 
through a unique medical record number and include membership 
information, medical encounters, and other healthcare information. 
A detailed description of the cohort design and measurement pro‐
tocol has been published elsewhere.23
The analytic population of the present study was comprised 
of a subpopulation of the KPSC Children’s Health Study. During 
the study period, we identified 826 648 youth between the ages 
of 3 and 17 years who were KPSC members between January 1, 
2012, and December 31, 2015, and had a medical encounter with 
at least one BP reading and valid height. We excluded youth who 
were pregnant (n = 1696) or whose medical record indicated fever 
(n = 65 240) when BP was measured. We also excluded youth with 
a preexisting diagnosis of hypertension (n = 2231) and chronic con‐
ditions known to significantly affect BP (n = 1686), such as growth 
hormone deficiency or overproduction, aortic coarctation, chronic 
renal disease, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing syndrome, 
hyperaldosteronism, and/or hyperthyroidism.25 Of the remaining 
cohort of 755 795 youth, we identified 186 732 (24.7%) with at 
least one BP reading ≥95th percentile for sex, age, and height during 
the 4- 
year study period who were used as the final analytical cohort. 
The study protocol was reviewed and approved by KPSC’s institu‐
tional review board.
2.2 | Body weight and height
Body weight and height were routinely measured and extracted from 
the EMR. Definitions for overweight and obesity in youth at the first 
visit with high BP are based on the sex- 
specific body mass index (BMI)- 
for- 
age growth charts developed by the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention.26 Overweight was defined as BMI- 
for- 
age ≥85th and 
< 95th percentile (or BMI ≥25 kg/m2), obesity as ≥95th percentile (or 
BMI ≥30 kg/m2) and severe obesity as BMI- 
for- 
age ≥1.2 × 95th per‐
centile (or BMI ≥35 kg/m2).27,28
2.3 | Race and ethnicity
We obtained race and ethnicity information from health plan admin‐
istrative records and birth records. We categorized race/ethnicity as 
non- 
Hispanic white, Hispanic (regardless of race), African American, 
Asian or Pacific Islander, and other or unknown race/ethnicity.
2.4 | Socioeconomic status
Since individual- 
level education and household income were not 
available through EMRs, neighborhood education and neighborhood 
household income at the first visit with high BP were used to indicate 
socioeconomic status. These population- 
level indicators were esti‐
mated by geocoding cohort members’ addresses to 2010 US census 
block data.29 We also used insurance through government health‐
care assistance programs such as Medicaid as an additional proxy for 
 
socioeconomic status.
2.5 | BP screening and classification
BP was measured routinely at the beginning of almost every outpa‐
tient medical visit, as described in detail elsewhere.30 Nurses and med‐
ical assistants were trained according to guidelines of the American 
Association of Critical Care Nurses for pediatric care.31 Digital devices 
(Welch Allyn Connex series, Welch Allyn Inc.) are the preferred BP 
measurement devices at KPSC. However, it is possible that in some 
cases, a wall- 
mounted aneroid sphygmomanometer (Welch Allyn Inc.) 
was used instead of the preferred device. Medical staff were trained 
to ensure that the bladder inside the cuff encircled 80% to 100% of 
the circumference of the right arm according to standard recommen‐
dations.31 A full range of different cuff sizes were available at the lo‐
cations where patient BP was taken. All staff members who measure 
BP as part of their daily job functions are certified in BP measurement 
during their initial staff orientation and recertified annually. BP read‐
ings are manually entered into the EMR system. BP is automatically 
translated into BP percentiles and available together with BP history 
of the previous two visits in the progress notes. However, no alerts 
were used to inform whether a BP should be considered elevated and 
no best practice recommendations were provided during the study 
period on recommended follow- 
up and/or treatment.
BP readings for all outpatient medical encounters were extracted 
from the EMR. We classified BP using the recommendations of the 
Fourth Report on the Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Treatment of High 
Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents of the National High 
Blood Pressure Education Program.15,19 Depending on sex, age, and 
height, BP was defined as hypertensive stage 1 if it was ≥95th percen‐
tile but <99th percentile plus 5 mm Hg, and hypertensive stage 2 if 
≥99th percentile plus 5 mm Hg.
2.6 | Study outcomes
The primary study outcome was the misclassification of the final visit 
outcome after an initial BP reading ≥95th percentile for sex, age, and

height during outpatient visits (n = 186 732 youth). Using the mean 
of two consecutive BPs during an outpatient medical visit as the gold 
standard,15 we classified an individual’s visit result as correct, false- 
positive high BP (defined as BP status higher than correct), false nega‐
tive (defined as BP status lower than correct), or unknown (if initial BP 
was not repeated, n = 18 172) compared with an assessment based on 
the initial BP. Similarly, we examined the classification of an individu‐
al’s visit result as correct, false positive, or false negative if the lower 
of two BP readings would be used compared with the initial reading. 
Among youth who were not classified as unknown during their initial 
visit (ie, had a repeated BP reading), the secondary study outcome was 
sustained hypertension defined as a total of three consecutive vis‐
its with a BP ≥95th percentile for sex, age, and height (n = 168 560). 
These youths were classified as sustained if they had any three con‐
secutive visits with a BP ≥95th percentile. If all three BPs were ≥95th 
percentile but <99th percentile plus 5 mm Hg, then sustained high BP 
was classified as hypertension stage I. If any one BP recording was 
≥99th percentile plus 5 mm Hg, then sustained high BP was classified 
as hypertension stage II. Other youth were classified as either, “not 
sustained,” or unknown (if no or incomplete follow- 
up occurred).
2.7 | Statistical analysis
Summary statistics were calculated for sociodemographic charac‐
teristics. To investigate the relationship between sociodemographic 
characteristics (sex, age, race, and baseline weight class) and the rep‐
etition of BP measurement, log binomial models from the SAS pro‐
cedure GENMOD were used. Crude and adjusted relative risk and 
confidence intervals are reported. Models were adjusted for all other 
sociodemographic characteristics listed above. After an initial high BP 
≥95th percentile for sex, age, and height, the follow- 
up was classi‐
fied as completed if: (1) one follow- 
up visit occurred with a BP < 95th 
percentile, or (2) two follow- 
up visits occurred with a BP ≥95th per‐
centile, or (3) one follow- 
up visit occurred with a BP ≥95th percentile 
and one <95th percentile.15–19 Log binomial models were used to de‐
scribe the association between patient characteristics and completion 
of recommended follow- 
up. All analyses were performed using SAS 
statistical software version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc).
3 | RESULTS
3.1 | Study population characteristics
Of 755 795 youth aged between 3 and 17 years, 186 732 youth 
(24.7%) had a first BP reading ≥95th percentile for sex, age, and height 
between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2015. The majority of 
youth was Hispanic (52.4%) and had normal body weight (51.3%). 
About 26.5% of youth received healthcare services under a state 
subsidized health plan such as MediCal. Among 186 732 youth with 
high BP, 167 402 (89.6%) of youth had an initial BP ≥95th percentile 
indicating hypertension stage I and 19 330 (10.4%) ≥99th + 5 mm Hg 
percentile indicating hypertension stage II (Table 1). A repetition of BP 
within the same visit was documented in the EMR for 18.3% of visits 
indicating hypertension stage I and 50.9% indicating hypertension 
stage II (P < .001). In crude analysis, a high BP reading ≥95th percen‐
tile was more likely to be repeated during the same visit if the patient 
was male, older, overweight to obese, Asian, or Hispanic. After multi‐
variable adjustment, the likelihood for a repeated reading after an ini‐
tial BP ≥95th percentile was no longer significant for Hispanic youth. 
After multivariable adjustment, a high BP reading ≥99th + 5 mm Hg 
percentile was more likely to be repeated during the same visit if the 
patient was older, and less likely if the patient was Asian. The pres‐
ence of obesity was not associated with the likelihood for a repeated 
BP after an initial BP reading ≥99th + 5 mm Hg percentile.
3.2 | Hypertension stage I
In youth for which the initial high BP percentile was repeated during 
their visit (n = 30 565), 51.2% of youth with an initial BP ≥95th per‐
centile had a mean of two consecutive BP < 95th percentile and were 
false- 
positive results; these patients would be required to schedule 
potentially unnecessary follow- 
up appointments if the initial BP read‐
ing would not have been repeated (Figure 1). Only 48.2% of youth 
also had a mean BP ≥95th percentile. Another 1.2% of youth had a 
mean BP ≥95th percentile but an initial BP reading <95th percentile 
and would be missed based on their initial BP (ie, false negative). In 
71.4% of youth with an initial BP ≥95th percentile, the lower of two 
BP readings was <95th percentile.
In youth with a BP ≥95th percentile during an outpatient visit, two 
more follow- 
up visits are recommended to meet a diagnosis of hy‐
pertension and further workup should be considered. About 32.2% 
of youth with a visit indicating hypertension stage I completed the 
recommended follow- 
up within 3 months (Table 2). Completion of fol‐
low- 
up visits varied slightly but significantly and was somewhat higher 
in older and lower in minority youth.

For the majority of youth with an initial BP ≥95th percentile during 
an outpatient visit, the required follow- 
up to confirm or rule out hy‐
pertension was not completed and their BP status could not be deter‐
mined (n = 114 206, 67.8%). Among those with the required follow- 
up 
visits (n = 54 354), hypertension was not sustained in 97.7% of youth 
with an initial BP ≥95th percentile (Figure 2). Only 2.3% of youth con‐
tinued to have BP ≥95th percentile indicating hypertension stage I.
3.3 | Hypertension stage II
In youth for which the initial high BP ≥99th + 5 mm Hg percentile was 
repeated during their visit (n = 9840), 35.0% of youth also had a mean 
BP ≥99th + 5 mm Hg percentile (Figure 1). Among youth with an ini‐
tial BP ≥99th + 5 mm Hg percentile, the mean of two BP was <95th 
percentile in 65.0% of youth who would have false- 
positive results 
if the BP would not have been repeated. In 81.0% of youth with an 
initial BP ≥99th + 5 mm Hg percentile, the lower of two BP readings 
was <95th percentile.
Approximately 31.7% of patients indicating hypertension stage 
II completed the recommended follow- 
up within 3 months (Table 2). 
This was significantly higher in older than in younger patients (36.1% 
in those aged 12–17 years vs 28.4% in those aged 3–5 years) and 
lower in most minority youth. For the majority of youth with an ini‐
tial BP ≥99th + 5 mm Hg percentile during an outpatient visit, the 
required follow- 
up to confirm or rule out hypertension was not com‐
pleted and could not be determined (n = 8646, 68.3%). Among those 
with the required follow- 
up visits, hypertension was sustained in 
11.3% of youth with an initial BP ≥99th + 5 mm Hg percentile but not 
sustained in 88.7% (Figure 2). Hypertension was sustained at the hy‐
pertension stage II level in 7.3% and at the hypertension stage I level 
in 4.0% of those with an initial BP ≥99th + 5 mm Hg percentile during 
an outpatient visit.
4 | DISCUSSION
BP in the hypertensive range is common in clinical care as first read‐
ings. Almost one of four youth between the ages of 3 and 17 years 
had at least one BP ≥95th percentile for sex, age, and height. Current 
clinical practice guidelines for evaluation of elevated BP in children 
and adolescents recommend repeating an elevated office BP reading 
at the same visit, but there are few data available to support this rec‐
ommendation. The present study showed that BP was not repeated 
during the same visit as recommended in almost 80% of youth. Less 
than half of the pediatric patients (45.9%) would be correctly classified 
based on their initial BP; the failure to repeat a high BP at the time of 
the initial visit resulted in a large proportion of false- 
positive results 
(54.1%) from general BP screening. Our results also indicate that if 
asymptomatic youth are screened and followed up as recommended 
within 3 months, hypertension is confirmed in only a small proportion 
of youth. About 2% of youth with an initial visit indicating hyperten‐
sion stage I, and 11% of youth with an initial visit indicating hyperten‐
sion stage II continued to have high BP during their follow- 
up visits.
Several issues pose significant challenges for pediatricians to 
effectively screen high BP in youth. For adults, simple and straight‐
forward BP cutoff values guide clinical decision- 
making, while the 
definition of high BP in youth is much more complex. The defini‐
tion of normal BP values in children and adolescents varies by sex, 
age, and height. Values from BP readings need to be converted into 
BP percentiles available in standardized tables, which takes time. 
Because BP in youth varies, it is recommended to repeat high BP 
readings during the same visit and to schedule follow- 
up visits to 
confirm sustained hypertension in three independent medical vis‐
its for a diagnosis of hypertension and for further evaluation of un‐
derlying causes in youth. Our understanding of the implications of 
nonadherence to screening guidelines with regard to the potential 
misclassification of a normotensive patient as having hypertension 
when conducting studies using EMR data or missing patients with 
true hypertension is limited.
While screening for high BP in asymptomatic youth is recom‐
mended as an important strategy for early diagnosis and treatment of 
hypertension to prevent cardiovascular disease,13–19 the implications 
of general BP screening for clinical care have to be considered. The re‐
sults of our study show that almost 25% of youth had at least one high 
BP value recorded in their EMR when a general screening was per‐
formed at every visit. These visits are not limited to well- 
child visits but

include acute care visits. In a recent large study of several healthcare 
systems, only 5% of youth had a high BP value during well- 
child vis‐
its.6 Considering the high proportion of youth with a high BP reading 
resulting from general screening at every visit, following standardized 
screening procedures and adherence to recommendations, such as the 
repetition of initial high BP readings, is crucial to avoid unnecessary 
follow- 
up visits but also to prevent the possibility that true hyperten‐
sion is not overlooked and underdiagnosed in high- 
risk youth.21,22
The failure to repeat a high BP at the time of the initial visit is 
concerning because the large number of false- 
positives results (54.1%) 
from general BP screening in asymptomatic youth would almost dou‐
ble the number of youth estimated to have a hypertensive BP value 
and would require additional follow- 
up visits. The calculation of the 
mean BP during the same visit may be a barrier towards BP screening 
in youth. If the lower of two BP readings would be used as the visit 
result, an initial BP ≥95th percentile was not confirmed in 71.4% of 
youth (81.0% of youth with an initial BP ≥99th + 5 mm Hg percentile). 
Appropriate training for providers and office staff on the importance 
of using standardized BP screening protocols, especially the impor‐
tance to repeat an initial high BP during the same visit is necessary. If 
the proportion of false- 
positive results can be reduced, resources can 
be directed towards youth who benefit from follow- 
up by confirming 
or ruling out true hypertension. Providers may be inclined to dismiss a 
first high BP, especially if a child is upset. It may be common practice to 
accept the last BP as the valid BP, and averaging BPs may not occur as 
recommended. Using the lower versus the mean of BP readings during 
a visit may simplify the efforts for providers, but studies are needed 
to compare both methods in their effectiveness to detect youth with 
true hypertension.
To overcome some of the challenges associated with BP screening 
in the clinical setting, in which the present study was conducted, EMR 
tools were developed that translate absolute BP values into BP per‐
centiles and provide easy access to BP history during a visit. Results 
from the present study indicate that simple tools translating BP into 
percentiles were not successful to achieve a high adherence to cur‐
rent recommendations to screen for high BP in asymptomatic youth. 
The adherence to recommendations such as the repetition of high BP 
readings during the same visit and the scheduling of follow- 
up visits 
was low. Studies are needed to test the efficiency of EMR- 
embedded 
decision support tools that populate alerts to the provider regarding 
high BP and the recommended best practice for each patient based on 
their BP and medical history.
BP in youth varies and a high BP value often reverses to normal 
without any intervention.7 Therefore, the criteria for diagnosing hy‐
pertension in youth require sustained hypertension in three indepen‐
dent medical visits. If an initial high BP is not recognized or dismissed, 
a follow- 
up visit may not be scheduled as recommended. In a school- 
based study, the proportion of youth with elevated BP values based on 
one visit was five times higher than that based on three measurements 
taken within a few weeks.32 In our study, initial hypertension was con‐
firmed during follow- 
up visits in only 2.3% of pediatric patients with 
an initial high BP indicating hypertension stage I and 11.3% of pedi‐
atric patients with an initial high BP indicating hypertension stage II. 
The majority of youth did not meet the criteria for sustained hyperten‐
sion. Future studies in a clinical environment with high adherence to 
the current screening guidelines are necessary to estimate the rate of 
sustained hypertension across different population groups defined by 
sex, age, race, and other potential risk factors.
Findings from our study indicate that only about one of three pa‐
tients complete the recommended follow- 
up visits after a visit with an 
initial high BP within 3 months. This finding is consistent with other 
studies, in which 80% of pediatric patients with high BP did not have 
a follow- 
up meeting as recommended.20–22 Automated tools and 
alert systems may support this process, as shown in other settings.22 
However, the results from the present study indicate that simple tools 
translating BP into percentiles, as used here, are not sufficient and need 
to be replaced by more sophisticated and automated computer- 
assisted 
support tools that populate alerts and provide best practice advice.
5 | STUDY STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS
Several strength and limitations should be noted. The large and di‐
verse population- 
based sample allows us to estimate the prevalence 
of high BP and the potential misclassification in defined subpopula‐
tions in routine outpatient medical visits. Several measurements were 
taken to ensure high quality and that BP readings followed strict 
protocols according to published recommendations.19,31,33 However, 
this may not always be the case in clinical practice. We cannot en‐
sure that BPs were accurately measured during all routine care visits. 
The intensity of in- 
house training may have varied by medical center. 
Deviations of the preferred measurement method may have occurred. 
It is possible that additional BP measurements were performed but 
were not documented in the EMR system or captured through data 
abstraction. This would have led to an underestimation of adherence 
to current BP screening guidelines. However, because of the current 
FIGURE 2 Hypertension status in pediatric patients with an initial 
visit indicating hypertension (HTN) stage I or stage II after completing 
their follow- 
up visits.

KOEBNICK Et al.
clinical workflows, constant training, and quality checks, these de‐
viations are unlikely to have affected the results. Another potential 
limitation is the type of device used in the clinical settings. Automated 
digital BP monitors are the preferred devices, while standard BP val‐
ues were developed based on standard mercury sphygmomanom‐
eters. However, the use of automated devices is frequent in clinical 
settings.34 Measurement error may explain the high number of youth 
with initial high BP. It may also be difficult to get accurate BP read‐
ings for children regardless of the type of device in real- 
life clinical 
situations when assessing BP at every visit. While we cannot exclude 
errors from the use of automated digital BP monitors, our results can‐
not be explained by a slight but systematic overestimation caused by 
these devices. However, the proportion of youth with high BP ob‐
served here was high compared with other studies using automated 
digital devices.6 Moreover, the proportion of false- 
positive results was 
particularly high when using the lower of two readings as standard. 
These facts suggest that our observation was not a device issue but a 
matter of practicality or training to achieve accurate BP readings for 
children during routine clinic visits. Last, the adherence to recommen‐
dations to repeat BPs during the same visit and to schedule follow- 
up 
visits was low. This may limit the generalizability of the magnitude 
of misclassification and the proportion of youth with sustained high 
BP. However, we carefully examined a variety of risk factors that may 
indicate selection bias. For the repetition of high BP readings during 
the same visit, we observed that patients were more likely to have a 
repeated BP if they were male, older, and obese. This observation sug‐
gests that the magnitude of misclassification may be higher in patients 
who are younger, female, and not obese. In contrast, scheduling ap‐
propriate follow- 
up visits after an initial visit with high BP was remark‐
ably independent of known risk factors for hypertension and suggests 
that high BP is ignored in youth regardless of risk factors.
6 | CONCLUSIONS
Our findings suggest that a high initial BP reading in youth is common, 
while the proportion of youth with sustained hypertension is low. 
Repeating an initial hypertensive BP during the same visit as recom‐
mended by current guidelines is important to rule out false- 
positive 
results and to avoid unnecessary follow- 
up visits to confirm whether 
the hypertensive BP persists. Personnel training needs to emphasize 
the importance of repeating high BP readings.
