Chronic Fatigue in Ehlers–Danlos
Syndrome—Hypermobile Type
ALAN HAKIM,* INGE DE WANDELE, CHRIS O’CALLAGHAN, ALAN POCINKI,
AND PETER ROWE
Chronic fatigue is an important contributor to impaired health-related quality of life in Ehlers–Danlos syndrome.
There is overlap in the symptoms and findings of EDS and chronic fatigue syndrome. A proportion of those with
CFS likely have EDS that has not been identified. The evaluation of chronic fatigue in EDS needs to include a
careful clinical examination and laboratory testing to exclude common causes of fatigue including anemia,
hypothyroidisim, and chronic infection, as well as dysfunction of major physiological or organ systems. Other
problems that commonly contribute to fatigue in EDS include sleep disorders, chronic pain, deconditioning,
cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction, bowel and bladder dysfunction, psychological issues, and nutritional
deficiencies. While there is no specific pharmacological treatment for fatigue, many medications are effective for
specific symptoms (such as headache, menstrual dysfunction, or myalgia) and for co-morbid conditions that
result in fatigue, including orthostatic intolerance and insomnia. Comprehensive treatment of fatigue needs to
also evaluate for biomechanical problems that are common in EDS, and usually involves skilled physical therapy
and attention to methods to prevent deconditioning. In addition to managing specific symptoms, treatment of
fatigue in EDS also needs to focus on maintaining function and providing social, physical, and nutritional
support, as well as providing on-going medical evaluation of new problems and review of new evidence about
proposed treatments.

INTRODUCTION
Fatigue can be temporally categorized as
recent, prolonged, or chronic that is less
than 1, 1–6, and more than 6 months,
respectively. Its persistence and impact
on daily activities and quality of life are
recognized in the descriptors of the
condition Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
(CFS), also known as myalgic encepha-
lomyelitis (ME).
Fatigue may be a principal present-
ing
symptom
in
Ehlers–Danlos
syndrome—hypermobile type (hEDS).
However a clinician may diagnose CFS
without appreciating the presence or
pre-existence of features that may have
led to a diagnosis of hEDS. The risk then
is attention may be taken away from
specific triggering factors for fatigue and
adaptations to management specific to
hEDS such as physical therapies.

 appreciating the presence or
pre-existence of features that
may have led to a diagnosis of
hEDS.
The purpose of this review is to
explore what is known of the assocation
between fatigue and hEDS; provide
guidance on the assessment and man-
agement of fatigue in the context of
hEDS; and consider areas for further
research in this field.
METHODS
The committee on Chronic Fatigue of
the
International
Ehlers–Danlos
Syndrome Consortium met by telecon-
ference or through electronic corre-
spondence throughout 2015 and 2016
to discuss the associations of chronic
fatigue with hEDS and its assessment
and management. The following reflects
the Committee’s literature review and
professional experience as well as in-
sights from various contributing mem-
bers of the international effort on EDS
through the Consortium.
LITERATURE REVIEW
Fatigue is common and often disabling in
hEDS [Rowe et al., 1999; Hakim and
Grahame, 2004; Voermans et al., 2010;
Castorietal.,2011;VoermansandKnoop,
2011; Murray et al., 2013; Scheper et al.,
2016].IthasbeenassociatedinhEDSwith
muscle weakness [Voermans et al., 2011;
Celletti et al., 2012], and kinesiophobia
[Celletti et al., 2013]. However, there are
no large randomized trials of the manage-
ment of fatigue in EDS. The few
publications that offer management ad-
vice are based on either small cohort
studies or expert opinion.
There is no specific definition for
chronic fatigue in hEDS. The authors
recommend the following definitions of
fatigue,similar inconceptandsubstanceto
that publishedbythe Institute of Medicine
[2015]. Chronic fatigue is defined by:
� Persistent and/or recurrent fatigue, that
has been present for more than 6 months,
� unexplained by other conditions,
� not the result of ongoing exertion,
� not substantially alleviated by rest,
� resulting in a substantial reduction or
impairment in the ability to engage in
normal levels of activities.
CAUSAL ASSOCIATIONS
A full history (including exacerbating
and alleviating factors, sleep disturbance
and stressors, and perceived impact on
wellbeing) should be taken, and include
assessment of psychological wellbeing
both as a cause and an impact. Because
fatigue is such a common symptom in
systemic illnesses not related to hEDS,
and can be associated with disease in any
organ system, it is fundamentally im-
portant that a thorough history and
physical examination is undertaken.
A full history (including
exacerbating and alleviating
factors, sleep disturbance and
stressors, and perceived impact
on wellbeing) should be taken,
and include assessment of
psychological wellbeing both
as a cause and an impact.
The following causes for fatigue are
common findings in hEDS.
� Poor sleep quality—in hEDS initiation,
maintenance and restoration of sleep
may be disturbed by factors such as pain,
nocturnal tachycardia, or sleep disor-
dered breathing.1
� Chronic pain—typically both neuro-
pathic in nature and from acute and
chronic mechanical joint and soft tissue
injury.
� Physical deconditioning (as opposed to
physical “weakness”)—that arises from
poor physical activity.
� Orthostaticintolerance[DeW
andeleetal.,
2016], and cardiovascular dysregulation
(e.g., tachycardia, hypotension, syncope).
� Bowel dysfunction (e.g., malabsorption
and subsequent nutritional deficiencies).
� Nocturnal micturition due to bladder
dysfunction or polyuria which is usually
secondary to increased fluid consumption
butmayalsobeaconsequenceofincreased
urine production during recumbent pos-
ture, eliminating fluid “pooled” in the
lower body during the day.
� Anxiety and/or depression.
� Headaches/migraines.
It is important to recognize that
chronic fatigue may be the result of a co-
existing condition. “Red flag” alerts of a
serious different condition include:
� Weight loss,
� significant lymphadenopathy,
� clubbing,
� persistent shortnessof breath on exertion
(exertional dyspnoea is often a conse-
quence of cardiovascular dysfunction),
� fevers,
� red, swollen joints,
� bronzing of the skin,
� abnormalities
on
the
neurological
examination,
� later age of onset.
The following should then be ex-
cluded or investigated further if thought
to be present:
� Chronic infection (e.g., hepatitis, tubercu-
losis,brucellosis,endocarditis,Lymedisease),
� endocrine disorders (e.g, diabetes, thy-
roid disease, adrenal insufficiency),
� autoimmune inflammatory conditions
(e.g., joints, skin, bowel, liver, and renal
disorders),
� cardiorespiratory disease,
� sleep disordered breathing,
� neurological disorders (e.g., myasthenia
gravis, multiple sclerosis).
CONTROVERSIES
It is the authors’ opinion that the criteria
used for diagnosing CFS and hEDS are
1While daytime napping may be beneficial as
part of rest and relaxation, it may in some cases
lead to either a shift or reversal of the day–night
sleep cycle, with resultant difficulty sleeping at
night and daytime somnolence, and therefore
be more detrimental than beneficial.

 inadequate and contribute to diagnostic
confusion. To meet a diagnosis of CFS,
fatigue must be “unexplained by other
conditions.” Therefore, a diagnosis of
hEDS must exclude a diagnosis of CFS.
However, hEDS is likely to be substan-
tially under-diagnosed and it is likely
that some patients diagnosed with CFS
may meet or would previously have met
the criteria for diagnosis of hEDS. Also it
is the authors’ opinion that the literature
and diagnostic methods for CFS and
hEDS are of insufficient strength to
reliably differentiate between these con-
ditions in a given individual. We would
conclude that in the context of hEDS
one would simply use the term chronic
fatigue.
TreatmentoffatigueinhEDSisbased
on guidance from the general literature on
management of chronic fatigue, and
expert opinion. There is no evidence
for use of specific pharmacological thera-
pies in hEDS, though these are, within
licencing regulation, recommended.
MANAGEMENT AND CARE
GUIDELINES
Assessment of Severity and Impact
of Fatigue
There is no single tool for the assessment
of patients with fatigue that allows a
global appraisal of its severity and
impact. Also fatigue may be an expres-
sion of an underlying disorder, and it is
the severity and impact of that disorder
per se that is the issue.
More formal questionnaires that
address fatigue include the Multidimen-
sional Fatigue Inventory—Short Form
(MFI-SF), a 30-item self-report instru-
ment designed to measure fatigue. The
full MFI is 83 questions [Smets et al.,
1995]. It explores general, physical, and
mental fatigue, reduced motivation and
reduced activity. Subsections of it can be
used to look at specific areas such as
mental fatigue.
Simple tools such as the Wood
Mental Fatigue Inventory can be used
in the clinic to explore the cognitive
symptomsoffatigue[Bentalletal.,1993].
Scales for functional assessment,
such as the Medical Outcomes Study
Short-Form General Health Survey
(SF-361) and Sickness Impact Profile
(SIP) may be helpful.
Simple tools such as the
Wood Mental Fatigue
Inventory can be used in the
clinic to explore the cognitive
symptoms of fatigue.

assessment, such as the
Medical Outcomes Study

Survey (SF-36W) and Sickness
Impact Profile (SIP) may be
helpful.
Whitehead [2009] analized of the
scales most often used in research. The
review identified three short instru-
ments demonstrate good psychometric
properties (namely the Fatigue Severity
Scale [FSS], Fatigue Impact Scale [FIS],
and Brief Fatigue Inventory [BFI]),
as did three comprehensive instruments
(namely
the
Fatigue
Symptom
Inventory
[FSI],
Multidimensional
Assessment of Fatigue [MAF], and
Multidimensional
Fatigue
Symptom
Inventory [MFSI]). Of these four mea-
sures (BFI, FSS, FSI, and MAF) dem-
onstrated the ability to detect change
over time and might therefore be more
suitable in the assessment of chronic
long-term conditions.
Perhaps the most useful informa-
tion clinically is that gained from
patient self-record of their daily activi-
ties, general function, and the degree of
disability perceived, for example how
far a patient can walk without having
to stop to rest, or how many flights of
stairs.
By
logging
a
list
of
these
activities and functions, the patient
has a baseline from which to set goals,
and the opportunity to judge improve-
ment in wellbeing by achieving these
goals. This process can be repeated to
challenge and record further improve-
ments over time.
Personal electronic devices are now
available to measure activity and these
can be useful in monitoring physical
exertion particularly during therapeutic
programs.
Advice and Treatment
General principles
To facilitate effective management the
clinician needs to establish a collabora-
tive relationship with the patient and
their
carers.
Engagement
with
the
family is particularly important for
children and young people, and for
people with severe fatigue.
The patient and their clinician
should share decision making both in
identifying the causes of, recognising the
impact of, and the phases in the
management of fatigue. Together this
might include:
� Understanding the need to exclude
underlying diseases and disorders.
� Recognizing the reality and impact
(physical, emotional, social [including
education and employment]) of the
condition and the symptoms.
� Setting realistic goals and timelines for
improvement, being prepared to man-
age set-backs/relapses.
� Exploring the range of interventions
and management strategies available,
taking account of the patients’ age
(particularly for children), the severity
of their symptoms, their preferences
and experiences, and the outcome of
previous treatment.
� Negotiating other areas of healthcare
provision, supporting applications for
financial benefits and social care, as well
as concerns related to education or
employment.
People with severe fatigue may
need support from a multidisciplinary
team for example, nursing, occupational
therapy, dietetics, psychology, physio-
therapy, and pain management. This
should be coordinated by a named

 healthcare professional, and usually their
general practitioner/general physician.
Treatment is based on addressing the
underlying issues. These might include
medications directed at orthostatic intol-
erance,
antidepressants,
anti-anxiety
drugs, management of allergies, use of
sleep aids, and pain management [Castori
et al., 2012], as well as a lifestyle changes
including pacing, changing sleep pattern,
exercise, and even a change of job or
hours of work.
There is no known pharmacological
treatment or cure for fatigue per se. Large
systematic reviews have not identified
consistentlyeffective medications for CFS
symptoms in general, but many medi-
cations are effective for specific symptoms
(e.g., headaches) and co-morbid condi-
tions that result in fatigue [Smith et al.,
2014]. Unless there is an underlying
medical disorder, the following medica-
tions should be avoided as they may cause
harm if used inappropriately:
� Glucocorticoids (in the absence of other
indications),
� thyroxine
(in
the
absence
of
hypothyroidism),
� antiviral agents2 (in the absence of
confirmed active viral infection).
There is insufficient evidence to
recommend the use of complementary
therapies and supplements for fatigue.
However, some patients choose to use
these therapies and find them helpful,
and there is little evidence of harm.
Typical agents include co-enzyme Q10,
Carnitine, alpha-lipoic acid, magne-
sium, nicotinamide adenine dinucleo-
tide (NADH), and multivitamins and
minerals. Co-enzyme Q and Riboflavin
have been shown to be effective in
migraine prophylaxis.
There is insufficient evidence
to recommend the use of
complementary therapies and
supplements for fatigue.
However, some patients
choose to use these therapies
and find them helpful, and
there is little evidence of
harm.
In some cases, patients with bowel
dysfunction
may
need
supplements
because of a restricted diet. A dietician’s
expertise
may
be
required
in
this
situation if the attending clinician is
not confident to advise.
Clinicians
and
patients
should
remain aware that some patients do
not
show
meaningful
responses
to
therapy.
Patients
with
intractable,
chronic and disabling conditions are
prone to feelings of abandonment and
may be vulnerable to potentially toxic
therapies or exploitative practitioners.
For such patients, the long-term sup-
portive and protective role of the
physician can be invaluable.
Maintaining independence
For people with moderate or severe
fatigue
that
has
not
responded
to
treatment, equipment and adaptations
(e.g., awheelchair) should be considered
as part of the management plan, after
assessing the risks and benefits for the
individual patient. Such adaptations may
be valued ways of gaining more inde-
pendence and improving quality of life.
Disruption of education or employ-
ment is generally detrimental to health
and wellbeing. The ability to continue in
these should be addressed early. The
clinician should assist, following consent
from their patient, by proactively and as
needs be regularly advising colleagues on
their patients’ fitness for work and
education, and the adjustments or adap-
tations required for them to remain in or
return to studies or work.
Treatment modalities
Sleep management, rest, and relaxation
and key approaches. Advice on sleep
management includes:
� Explaining the effect disordered sleep or
a poor sleep pattern can have on causing
and exacerbating fatigue can help an
individual understand how their behav-
iors might affect the normal day–night
sleep cycle.
� Identifying poor sleep patterns such as
insomnia,
hypersomnia,
an
altered
sleep–wake cycle, and non-refreshing
sleep despite either an apparent normal
cycle or prolonged sleep.
� Providing general advice on what good
sleep hygiene means (see below).
� Introducing changes to sleep patterns
gradually.
Good sleep hygiene includes:
� Avoiding stimulants such as caffeine or
nicotine too close to bedtime.
� Exercise during the day to promote
good sleep.
� Avoiding large meals too close to
bedtime.
� Relaxation techniques—establishing a
regular relaxing bedtime routine, avoid-
ing emotional upset/dwelling on prob-
lems before trying to go to sleep. Calm
music or reading may be relaxing for
some.
� Associate bed with sleep. Avoid watch-
ing
TV
,
playing
computer
games,
sending text messages, e-mails, etc.
Calm music or reading may be relaxing
for some.
� The
sleep
environment
should
be
pleasant and relaxing. The bed should
be comfortable, and the room dark,
quiet, and neither too hot or too cold.
During the day, exercise may also
encourage wakefulness, as should ade-
quate exposure to natural light. Espe-
cially early in the day, light exposure
helps to maintain a healthy sleep–wake
cycle.

however, there is very little evidence of efficacy
in the literature.

 Chronic pain may be a dominant
influence on sleep; it should be managed
accordingly. Prescribing of low-dose
tricyclic antidepressants, specifically am-
itriptyline, should be considered.
Other medications may assist sleep.
These include:
� Melatonin,
� doxepin,
� cyproheptadine,
� diphenhydramine,
� trazodone,
� propranolol,
� clonazepam,

important to maintain as normal a level of
activity as possible, whilst avoiding over-
exertion. There is always a balance here
andadvicerequiresindividualassessment.
Rest advice might include:
� Limiting the length of rest period to, say,
30 min.
� Undertaking low-level physical (arts,
crafts, etc.) and cognitive (reading,
puzzles, etc.) activities depending on
the severity of symptoms.
� Using relaxation techniques.
� Trying to avoid complete rest as the only
management during a setback/relapse.
Prolonged bed rest should be avoided
if possible. It is associated with significant
physical
deconditioning,
psychological
risks,andmedicaldisordersincludingsevere
postural hypotension, venous thrombosis,
osteoporosis, and pressure sores.
Relaxation techniques may help in
the management of pain, sleep prob-
lems, and comorbid stress or anxiety. It is
important that patients rest when tired,
and not use caffeine or stimulating
medications to “push through” periods
of severe fatigue. Common relaxation
techniques include:
� Progressive muscle relaxation. In this
technique the individual focuses on
slowly tensing and then relaxing each
muscle group.
� Visualization. For example the individ-
ual may imagine a peaceful setting and
then focus on controlled, relaxing
breathing, slowing the heart rate.
� Other techniques include:
� Massage,
� meditation,
� yoga,
� music and/or art therapy.
Graded exercise therapy (GET) and
management of daily activities are also
fundamental
therapeutic
approaches.
Before advising on exercise the clinician
should consider the impact of joint
hypermobility and joint instability in
EDS, as well as the negative influence on
exercise that arises from uncontrolled
pain, fear of movement (kinesiophobia),
and other associated conditions such as
cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction.
Gradual exercise programmes may
be beneficial for some patients, improv-
ing physical, psychological, and cogni-
tive aspects of wellbeing. The main
objectives in EDS of an exercise pro-
gramme are the progressive prevention
of physical deterioration, optimization
of functional capacity without trigger-
ing injury, and pain control.
A
suitably
trained
therapist
or
instructor should deliver GET. Recom-
mendations such as “go to the gym,”
“exercise more,” or “go swimming” are
not helpful without supported advice on
what this actually means, and should be
avoided. It is recommended that exer-
cise should be supervised, structured,
and gradually increased in intensity
(both in
muscle strengthening
and
aerobic fitness as appropriate). Unstruc-
tured and unsupervised exercise may
worsen symptoms, as can a rigid or
inflexible escalation of activity.
GET should be based on the
individuals’ current level of activity
and individual goals. When planning
GET, it is important clinicians and/or
therapists:
� Undertake an assessment of current
activity analysis—while also ensuring
that this does not of itself already lead to
a “boom and bust” cycle.
� Discuss both short and long-term goals
important and relevant to the individual.
� Agree on a level of additional low-
intensity exercise that is sustainable
� Recognize that it can take weeks,
months, or even years to achieve goals,
and ensure that this is taken into account
in the therapy structure and the ways
services deliver treatment.
� Advise that increased levels of exercise
may increase symptoms for a few days
(e.g., stiffness and fatigue), but explain
that this is normal.
Before completing a GET pro-
gramme, it is important the individual
has been advised on maintaining the
exercise and strategies for managing set
backs, including access to their clinician
and/or therapist. Treatment of existing
movement restrictions and biomechan-
ical dysfunction using manual techni-
ques can be a bridge to tolerating
exercise for some individuals.
Activity management is a form of
pacing, controlling activities by means
that include:
� Planning daily activities to allow for a
balance and variety of different types of
activity, rest, and sleep.
� Spreading out difficult or demanding
tasks over the day or week.
� Splitting activities into small achievable
tasks.
� Monitoring, regulating, and planning
activitiestoavoida“boomandbust”cycle.
� Goal setting, planning, and prioritising
activities.
Cognitive
Behavioral
Therapy
(CBT) has both formal and informal
approaches.3 At an informal level, this
involves education about symptoms,
demystification of the medical prob-
lems, and explanation of how inactivity
can aggravate a number of the problems
that contribute to fatigue (e.g., decon-
ditioning, orthostatic intolerance).
3The authors caution that the effect size of CBT
is modest, that improvements are not always
sustained, and that CBT has not been studied in
those
with
more
severe
symptoms
and
impairment.
ARTICLE
AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS PART C (SEMINARS IN MEDICAL GENETICS)

 An individualized, person-centred
programme should be offered to people
with fatigue. The objectives of the
programme should be to:
� Sustain or gradually extend, the per-
son’s physical, emotional, and cognitive
capacity.
� Manage the physical and emotional
impact of their symptoms.
The components, and progression
throughout the programme should be
based on the person’s age, preferences
and needs, and should be delivered only
by a healthcare professional with appro-
priate training in CBT.
WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW
The incidence, prevalence, and natural
history of fatigue in the hEDS population
is unknown, so therefore also the distri-
bution and types of (co-associated) mech-
anisms that trigger this phenomenon.
Also, it is unclear as to how many
patients diagnosed with CFS actually
really have EDS, not CFS.
Subgroup clinical trials of efficacy
and safety of treatments are required to
move beyond the limitations of case
study and expert opinion evidence.
Future studies are also needed to assess
the effect of treatment on quality of life
and fatigue.
The influence of anxiety disorders/
mental health factors on presentation
and response to treatment are also not
clear.
SUMMARY
Fatigue is a common finding in EDS. It
may
present
in
a
manner
that
is
indistinguishable from CFS. Diagnosis
of fatigue remains an area of uncertainty:
the definition of fatigue remains uncer-
tain and diagnostic tests are not available.
The initial approach to fatigue in EDS is
to exclude other conditions that may
produce fatigue.
Conditions which are commonly
seen in EDS and which may manifest as
or exacerbate fatigue include sleep
disorder, chronic pain, deconditioning,
cardiovascular dysregulation, bowel and
bladder dysfunction, psychological is-
sues and nutritional deficiencies.
Treatment algorithms for fatigue
are poorly
defined
and
therapy
is
frequently ineffective and so aims of
treatment should be realistic. Treatment
should focus on improving symptoms,
maintaining function and providing
social, physical and nutritional support.
Where medical and physical inter-
ventions
fail
to
provide
substantial
symptomatic or functional improve-
ment, it is essential that clinicians
provide on-going support to patients
who
are
at
risk
of
feelings
of
abandonment.
