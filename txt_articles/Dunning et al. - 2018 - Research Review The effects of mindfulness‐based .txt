Background: Mindfulness based interventions (MBIs) are an increasingly popular way of attempting to improve the
behavioural, cognitive and mental health outcomes of children and adolescents, though there is a suggestion that
enthusiasm has moved ahead of the evidence base. Most evaluations of MBIs are either uncontrolled or
nonrandomized trials. This meta-analysis aims to establish the efficacy of MBIs for children and adolescents in
studies that have adopted a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) design. Methods: A systematic literature search of
RCTs of MBIs was conducted up to October 2017. Thirty-three independent studies including 3,666 children and
adolescents were included in random effects meta-analyses with outcome measures categorized into cognitive,
behavioural and emotional factors. Separate random effects meta-analyses were completed for the seventeen studies
(n = 1,762) that used an RCT design with an active control condition. Results: Across all RCTs we found significant
positive effects of MBIs, relative to controls, for the outcome categories of Mindfulness, Executive Functioning,
Attention, Depression, Anxiety/Stress and Negative Behaviours, with small effect sizes (Cohen’s d), ranging from .16
to .30. However, when considering only those RCTs with active control groups, significant benefits of an MBI were
restricted to the outcomes of Mindfulness (d = .42), Depression (d = .47) and Anxiety/Stress (d = .18) only.
Conclusions: This meta-analysis reinforces the efficacy of using MBIs for improving the mental health and wellbeing
of youth as assessed using the gold standard RCT methodology. Future RCT evaluations should incorporate scaled-
up definitive trial designs to further evaluate the robustness of MBIs in youth, with an embedded focus on
mechanisms of action. Keywords: Mindfulness; meta-analysis; intervention; adolescence; attention.
Introduction
Mindfulness has been defined as intentionally direct-
ing attention to present moment experiences with an
attitude of curiosity and acceptance (Bishop et al.,
2004). Individual differences in levels of ‘disposi-
tional’ mindfulness can be reliably assessed in both
adults (Brown & Ryan, 2003; Buchheld, Grossman, &
Walach, 2001; Feldman, Hayes, Kumar, Greeson, &
Laurenceau, 2004) and children/adolescents (Greco,
Dew, & Baer, 2006; Lawlor, Schonert-Reichl, Gader-
mann, & Zumbo, 2014), with higher levels associated
with better functioning for a range of psychological
and physical health outcomes (e.g. Baer, Smith,
Hopkins, Krietemeyer, & Toney, 2006; Barnes &
Lynn, 2010; Brown, Ryan, & Creswell, 2007).
Mindfulness skills can be augmented through
training, and a range of Mindfulness-Based Inter-
ventions (MBIs) have been developed to enhance
these capacities (Kabat-Zinn, 1982; Segal, Williams,
& Teasdale, 2002). It is hypothesized that the
enhancement of proximal skills trained by MBIs,
such as nonjudgmental attention control, may have
downstream effects on more distal outcomes such as
improved behaviour or reduced symptoms of psy-
chopathology.
Although the origins of mindfulness are rooted in
Buddhist philosophy and date back around two and
a half thousand years, the earliest example of a
formalized MBI is Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduc-
tion (MBSR; Kabat-Zinn, 1982; Kabat-Zinn, 1990).
MBSR was developed to help individuals learn to
cope with and manage illness, pain and stress.
Based on the
principles of MBSR,
other MBIs
emerged in the years that followed, such as Mind-
fulness-Based
Cognitive
Therapy
(MBCT;
Segal
et al., 2002), that focuses on helping to prevent the
recurrence of depression. In general, research with
adults suggests that MBIs have positive effects on
both mental and physical heath (e.g., Grossman,
Niemann, Schmidt, & Walach, 2003; Khoury et al.,
2013), though there are methodological concerns
about some past studies, in terms of insufficient
construct validity of outcome measures used, inter-
vention methodology, and how the data are inter-
preted.
More recently, focus has turned to the benefits of
using MBIs with children and adolescents. There are
a number of rationales for introducing mindfulness

 to young people, including enhancing core cognitive
skills to support academic and social functioning (for
a review see Weare, 2003). Indeed, childhood and
adolescence may be a particularly valuable time to
practice mindfulness as self-regulation and execu-
tive functioning develop markedly across this period
(e.g. Blakemore & Choudhury, 2006). In addition,
adolescence is a vulnerable period for the onset of
mental health problems, with around 50% of all
mental illness appearing before the age of 14 (Kessler
et al., 2005). Since mindfulness training has demon-
strated efficacy in preventing depressive relapse in
adults (see Kuyken et al., 2016 for an individual
participant data analysis of randomized controlled
trials), it is appropriate to explore whether MBIs
could also prevent depression or improve mental
health and wellbeing in young people.
However, enthusiasm for MBIs with children and
adolescents has arguably moved ahead of the evi-
dence base (Greenberg & Harris, 2012). There are
careful guidelines about the development and eval-
uation of complex interventions from theory through
to implementation (MRC, 2000, 2008). Early-stage
evaluations along this trajectory include case studies
and case series, and uncontrolled or nonrandomized
trials. Although helpful in identifying the likely
efficacy of an intervention and in ironing out proce-
dural uncertainties (Cooksey, 2006), such early-
stage studies should be regarded as preparation for
randomized, controlled trial (RCT) evaluations which
represent the current gold standard assessment
approach for emerging interventions.
In the case of MBIs for children and young people,
the process to date has rarely moved beyond early
stage evaluations: only about 30% of current studies
have
randomized
participants
to
condition
and
around 50% have used a comparison condition (see
Felver, Celis-de Hoyos, Tezanos, & Singh, 2016 for a
review). The choice of comparison condition used is
also an issue, typically these are passive, nonactive
comparisons such as no intervention, teaching/
treatment as usual or wait list that do not account
for
nonspecific
aspects
of
training
that
might
nonetheless affect performance, such as spending
time with a new teacher or increased motivation in
simply doing something different. Currently, only
around 10% of studies have used an ‘active’ com-
parison condition. An active control condition in MBI
studies should refer to something that might be
expected to benefit its participants and that matches
the MBI in all nonspecific factors. Importantly, it
should not include mindfulness as an ‘active ingre-
dient’ so that differences between the groups can be
attributed to an absence or a presence of mindful-
ness (see MacCoon et al., 2012 for a discussion).
Overview and limitations of previous meta-analyses
Although using mindfulness to improve the emo-
tional, behavioural and cognitive outcomes of young
people is a nascent field, there have already been
four notable meta-analyses. However, none of these
has disaggregated early stage non-RCT evaluations
from RCT data, nor distinguished between the types
of control groups used. Zoogman and colleagues
reviewed 20 controlled and uncontrolled studies
published between 2004 and 2011 with participants
aged between 6 and 21 years. Results showed that
MBIs significantly improved psychological symp-
toms, and attention/mindfulness, with small to
small-to-moderate effect sizes (Zoogman, Goldberg,
Hoyt, & Miller, 2015). Zenner, Herrnleben-Kurz, and
Walach (2014) synthesized 24 studies conducted in
schools
before
2012
with
participants
aged
6–
19 years. A significant benefit of MBIs was reported
for measures of cognition, stress and resilience with
effect sizes ranging from small-to-moderate to large.
There was no significant evidence that MBIs were
useful in reducing emotional problems.
The two more recent meta-analyses are larger,
reflecting the increased interest in the utility of MBIs
for improving the lives of young people. Klingbeil
et al. (2017) included separate analyses of con-
trolled, (k = 33), and uncontrolled (k = 43) studies
with participants aged 4–18 years. Outcome mea-
sures fell into two broad categories. Those related to
the skills of mindfulness, attention, meta-cognition/
cognitive flexibility that the MBI was designed to
train, and those related to putative distal outcomes
of academic achievement and emotional and beha-
vioural regulation that are proposed to shift down-
stream as a function of applying the trained skills in
day-to-day life. MBIs were shown to lead to signifi-
cant improvements across outcomes in all cate-
gories, in both controlled and uncontrolled studies.
Effect sizes for the uncontrolled studies ranged from
small to small-to-moderate. For the controlled stud-
ies, all effect sizes were in the small-to-moderate
range (Klingbeil et al., 2017). Finally, Maynard,
Solis, Miller, and Brendel (2017) reported data from
35 controlled and uncontrolled studies exploring a
range of MBIs delivered in schools to participants
aged 4–20 years. This meta-analysis showed that
the
MBIs
significantly
improved
cognitive
and
socioemotional skills (effect sizes were small) but
not academic or behavioural outcomes.
As might be expected, there is considerable overlap
of included studies in the previous meta-analyses.
For example 90% of the studies included in the
Zoogman et al. (2015) review are also present in the
meta-analysis by Klingbeil et al. (2017). Further-
more, and probably due to the lack of data available
at the time, the Zoogman meta-analysis combined
mindfulness and attention measures into a single
category
whereas
Klingbeil
separately
analysed
these outcomes. Likewise, about 60% of the studies
included in the Zenner meta-analysis were also
included by Maynard et al. (2017). Despite the
overlap in included studies, the outcomes are cate-
gorized differently across the meta-analyses. The

Meta-analysis of mindfulness based interventions for youth
245
 Zennner et al. meta-analysis categorized the out-
come measures into emotional problems, stress, and
resilience, whereas Maynard et al.’s meta-analysis
categorized the outcomes into socioemotional skills,
behaviour outcomes and academic outcomes. Each
meta-analysis therefore assesses broadly the same
sets of outcome measures but classifies them differ-
ently to create categories of particular interest to the
authors. Consequently, identifying patterns across
previous meta-analyses is difficult. From the evi-
dence it appears that MBIs may be useful for
improving mindfulness (Klingbeil et al., 2017; Zoog-
man et al., 2015) and cognition (Klingbeil et al.,
2017; Maynard et al., 2017; Zenner et al., 2014),
though evidence for improvements in outcomes such
as
emotional
and
behavioural
functioning
is
equivocal (see Table S1 in the online Supporting
Information section for effect sizes for previous meta-
analyses, broken down by category).
A problem with the extant meta-analyses, how-
ever, is the conflation of gold-standard RCT data
with earlier-phase evaluations of MBIs in youth.
There are at least two specific issues here. First,
some of the studies in Zoogman et al.’s (2015)
analysis did not include comparison groups; these
are essential to control for test-retest effects (Dik-
men, Heaton, Grant, & Temkin, 1999) and matura-
tional changes. Second, the meta-analyses that
separately evaluated studies with control groups
included studies that did not randomize participants
to condition (Maynard et al., 2017; Zenner et al.,
2014).
Nonrandomized
studies
are
unguarded
against expectancy or placebo effects. They are also
at a greater risk of sampling bias (e.g., allocating
participants to condition based on their preferences,
likely compliance or need), that undermines external
validity. In addition, all previous meta-analyses of
MBIs with youth have neglected to separately anal-
yse RCT outcomes for studies that use active control
groups from those that have a nonactive comparison
arm (for example, no intervention or wait list). Active
control groups are useful to control for aforemen-
tioned nonspecific effects. In addition, the use of
these groups is essential to mitigate the Hawthorne
effect (McCarney et al., 2007), used here to represent
the phenomenon that when participants know they
are in a control condition they are also aware that
they are not expected to show pre- to post-test
improvements. This may be particularly true for
participants in wait-list control groups who are
inevitably aware that they are not participating in
an active treatment or might be demoralized by their
randomization outcome and may be wary of present-
ing as improved in case the MBI is not offered at the
end of the wait period (Furukawa et al., 2014).
The current meta-analysis
The current state-of-the-art in the development of
MBIs
for
young
people
is
characterized
by
an
increasing number of small RCTs, either with or
without active control conditions. On the trajectory
of complex intervention development, such smaller
RCTs can be conceptualized as pilot, feasibility or
platform trials for larger-scale definitive RCTs which
are fully powered, draw on large representative
samples, compare the MBI against a plausible active
control condition (often reflective of current best
practice) with medium- to long-term follow-up, use a
manualized intervention with well-trained practi-
tioners, and use published protocols with clearly
identified primary outcome(s). At present, in the
context of MBIs for youth, no such definitive evalu-
ations are available, although some are in progress
(e.g. the Kuyken et al., 2017, protocol). In the
absence of any definitive trials of MBIs with children
and adolescents, meta-analytic synthesis of studies
that characterize the current state-of the-art is
essential. That was the aim behind the current
meta-analysis, which focusses exclusively on RCTs
with either passive (no intervention, usual practice,
or wait list) comparison conditions or comparison
where
a
structured
alternative
to
the
MBI
is
included. The studies to date with these structured
comparison conditions have comprised either con-
trol
interventions
designed
principally
to
take
account of nonspecific factors (henceforth ‘attention
placebo controls’) or, in a relatively small number of
studies (k = 9), control interventions with active
ingredients designed to drive change in one or more
specified outcomes (henceforth ‘active intervention
controls’). In all of the RCTs employing active com-
parisons (k = 17), whether they be attention placebo
or active intervention controls, reported here, the
stated hypotheses predicted superiority of the MBI
over the active control arm for the specified out-
comes.
We
took
a
number
of
other
study
selection
decisions designed to retain the focus on MBIs
delivered to a high standard. Consequently, the
present meta-analysis only comprises studies in
which the MBI is focused primarily on mindfulness
practice that originated from an established pro-
gram (e.g., MBSR), rather than those in which
elements of practice are substantially combined
with other activities (e.g., mindful yoga, mindful
colouring). All included studies involved MBIs deliv-
ered face-to-face over a series of sessions by trained
mindfulness
instructors
with
participants
aged
18 years
or
younger.
The
included
outcome
measures were categorized into measures of mind-
fulness, cognition (executive functioning and atten-
tion), behaviour (social and negative behaviour) and
emotion (depression and stress/anxiety) outcomes.
Finally, moderator analyses to examine the impor-
tance of study quality (i.e., risk of bias), duration of
MBI training (i.e., total number of hours of training)
and the age of the participants included in the MBIs
– likely to be a critical variable in youth studies –
were also conducted to establish a) whether study

 quality effects results; b) whether the amount of
time spent training drives the degree of improve-
ment; and c) whether MBIs are particularly benefi-
cial for younger children or older adolescents.
Methods
The study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA) statement (Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaff & Altman, 2009)
and was registered on the international prospective register of
systematic reviews (PROSPERO), number 42016038364, on
13/05/2016.
Search strategy and inclusion criteria
InOctober2017,separatecomprehensiveliteraturesearchesfor
published and unpublished articles were carried out by two
authors (DD, KG). Studies were identified from searches of
keywords and titles in the electronic databases Pubmed, ERIC,
Cochrane, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science with the
terms “mindful*” OR “MBCT” OR “MBSR” AND “child*” OR
“school” OR “adolescen*” OR “youth” used (see Appendix S2
online in the Supporting Information section for the full set of
search terms). We also checked reference lists of studies and
reviews for additional potentially relevant studies. Prominent
authors of mindfulness studies were contacted to ascertain if
they hadany unpublished data. No languageor otherlimitations
were imposed at this stage. The searches were then collated and,
after duplicates were removed, the abstracts of the remaining
studies were independently reviewed (DD, KG). If the abstract
suggested that the study may be appropriate for inclusion in the
meta-analysis then the full-text article of the study was evalu-
ated against our inclusion criteria. These are as follows:
1. Study design: the effects of mindfulness were compared
against a control condition (either no contact, waitlist,
active or attention placebo control) and the participants
were randomly assigned to condition;
2. Participants:
the
participants
were
aged
18 years
or
younger;
3. Intervention I: The core of the mindfulness training pro-
gram consisted of the essential elements laid out by Crane
et al., 2017 including:
a Present moment focus and decentring;
b The development of greater attentional and behavioural
self-regulation;
c Engaging the participant in sustained mindfulness med-
itation practice
4. Intervention II:
a The MBI was delivered over more than one session
b Mindfulness practice was the central component of the
intervention, rather than it being substantially combined
with another activity (e.g., mindful yoga, mindful colour-
ing) or a subcomponent of a broader complex intervention
(e.g., Acceptance Commitment Therapy);
c The mindfulness intervention was delivered by a trained
mindfulness teacher;
5. Outcome variables: The outcome measures provided quan-
titative data from which effect sizes could be calculated. If
the paper did not provide this then the authors were
contacted.
Thirty-three studies met these inclusion criteria and were
synthesized in the analysis (see Figure 1 for the PRISMA flow
diagram). Table S3 (online supporting information) shows the
studies included in the previous four meta-analyses that were
not included here and the reasons for exclusion.

Meta-analysis of mindfulness based interventions for youth
247
 We made the decision for our initial analysis to combine
active intervention and attention placebo control groups under
the single heading ‘active controls’. Likewise, the studies that
used either no contact and wait-list groups were combined and
are known hereafter as ‘passive controls’. However, we do also
present analyses by type of control group, see Table 3, and we
return to this important issue in the Discussion.
Data extraction and synthesis
For each study the following variables were recorded: age of
sample, total number of participants in study (i.e., number in
MBI group and number in control group), type of control
condition(s), total hours of mindfulness training (i.e., ses-
sions 9 duration in minutes, excluding home practice), total
weeks of mindfulness training, type of mindfulness practice
(e.g., MBSR) and the outcome measures reported. In cases
where studies did not include all of these data, authors were
contacted for more information.
Between-group effect sizes (Cohen’s d; Cohen, 1988) were
calculated based on the mean prepost change in the MBI group
minus the mean pre-post change in the control group, divided by
the pooled pretest standard deviation (Klauer, 2001; Morris,
2008). The pooled pretest standard deviation for weighting the
differences in the pre-post-means was used so the intervention
does not influence the standard deviation based on recommen-
dation by Carlson and Schmidt (1999). A positive effect size
indicates that the MBI group benefitted more than the compar-
ison group. Effect sizes were interpreted on the following basis:
d = .20, a small effect; d = .50, a moderate effect; and d = .80, a
large effect (Cohen, 1988). For data synthesis, outcome mea-
sures were placed into one of the following categories: Mindful-
ness, Executive Functioning (e.g., planning, working memory,
etc.), Attention, Depression, Stress/Anxiety, Negative beha-
viour (e.g., aggression, hostility, etc.) and Social behaviour (e.g.,
sharing, empathy, etc.). The decision to separate behavioural
outcomes into negative and social behaviour was based on the
view that these are dissociable constructs that could therefore
respond differentially to an MBI. If studies used multiple
measures to assess a single category then a mean of the effect
sizes for these measures was calculated on pre- to postinter-
vention effects. These categories were chosen based on those
used in previous meta-analyses and deemed most pertinent to
children and adolescents. Outcome measures were placed into
their chosen categories via discussion between all authors with
disagreements decided through general consensus. A full list of
the outcome measures used, their effect sizes and the categories
in which they were placed can be seen in Table 4.
Risk of bias
The Cochrane Collaboration’s Risk of Bias Tool (Higgins &
Green, 2011) was used to assess study quality. This involves
making a series of evidence-based judgements about specific
features of each study to establish whether biases exist that
could lead to an overestimation or underestimation of the true
intervention effect. Two authors (DD, KG) independently
graded the risk of bias in the following five categories: (a)
random sequencing – if the method used to randomly allocate
participants to group was appropriate; (b) allocation conceal-
ment – whether allocation to condition was concealed from
participants during enrolment; (c) blinding of outcome assess-
ment – if assessors were unaware of study condition; (d)
incomplete outcome data – whether missing outcome data
were appropriately reported and/or given appropriate statisti-
cal treatment; and (e) selective reporting – the degree to which
studies reported all prespecified outcomes.
Each category for each study was given one of three ratings: a
‘minus’ indicated a low risk of bias; a ‘plus’ indicated a high risk
of bias and a ‘question mark’ was used if the risk of bias was
unclear (Higgins & Green, 2011). After all studies were
independently rated, consensus was reached through discus-
sion. To enable the use of risk of bias as a moderator of the effects
of MBIs, a discrete variable was calculated. This was based on
the following: each ‘plus’ was given a value of �1, each ‘question
mark’ a value of 0 and each ‘minus’ a value of 1. Therefore,
individual studies could have a risk of bias score of between �5
and 5, with lower scores indicating a higher risk of bias.
To investigate publication bias, the extent to which the
studies included were representative of the population of
studies, a series of Begg’s funnel plots and Egger’s regressions
were conducted for each analysis. This is important for any
meta-analysis due to the tendency for journals to prefer to
publish studies with positive rather than negative findings
(Easterbrook, Gopalan, Berlin, & Matthews, 1991).
Analysis
All analyses were conducted using version 3.3 of the Compre-
hensive Meta-Analysis program (Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins,
& Rothstein, 2005). Confidence intervals were calculated for
effect sizes.
Heterogeneity,theamountofdiversityinthecharacteristicsof
the outcome measures, was quantified using the Q statistic and
I2 estimates. For I2 estimates, a value of 0% equates to no
heterogeneity, 25% to low heterogeneity, 50% to moderate
heterogeneity and 75% to high heterogeneity (Higgins & Green,
2011).
As a result of variation in studies (e.g., sample type, age of
sample, outcome measures used) a random effects model was
chosen for all analyses. All 33 studies were included in initial
analyses and separate analyses were conducted on the 17
studies that used an active control condition. Individual,
random-effects meta-regressions assessed the impact of our
three identified moderator variables: age of sample, to estab-
lish if age determined who benefitted most from mindfulness;
total hours of mindfulness training, to explore if dose of
mindfulness training equates to better results; and risk of bias,
to establish if the quality of study design impacted the results.
Results
All RCTs
Table 1 shows the results of the meta-analysis for all
33 RCTs.
Across all RCTs, those participants receiving an
MBI improved significantly more than those receiv-
ing the control condition for the categories of Mind-
fulness and Executive Functions. The relative benefit
of receiving MBIs for Attention was not significant.
The categories of Depression and Anxiety/Stress
showed significantly greater reductions after an MBI
than after the control condition. MBIs did not have a
significantly
greater
impact
on
changing
Social
Behaviour. However, the category of Negative Beha-
viour was significant, with MBI recipients showing a
greater reduction in problems than those receiving
the control condition. For statistically significant
results, effect sizes ranged from small (.19) to small-
to-moderate (.30)*.

 RCTs with active control groups
A subanalysis was conducted on only those 17
RCTs with active control groups (Table 2). These
data show that those completing MBIs improved
significantly
more
than
those
in
active
control
interventions for Mindfulness and there was also a
greater reduction in problems following an MBI than
following the active control condition for the cate-
gories Depression and Anxiety/Stress. Effect sizes
for significant results ranged from small (.18) to
small-to-moderate (.42). There were no significant
effects on changes in measures of Social Behaviour,
Negative
Behaviour,
Executive
Functions,
or
Attention.
RCTs disaggregated by type of control group
Table 3 shows all RCTs disaggregated by control
group type. MBIs showed significant benefits over all
control group types with effect sizes ranging from
small (.10) to small-to-moderate (.38).
Heterogeneity
For all 33 RCTs, Q values show that there was a
statistically significant level of heterogeneity for the
categories
of
Mindfulness,
Executive
Functions,
Negative Behaviour, Social Behaviour, and Depres-
sion. Significant scores ranged from 35.64 to 63.95.
All evaluations of significant categories suggested a
substantial amount of heterogeneity, with I2 esti-
mates ranging from 47.54% to 76.35% (Table 1).
For the 17 RCTs with active control groups, Q values
showed that Negative Behaviour and Social Behaviour
both showed a significant amount of heterogeneity
with scores ranging from 15.86 to 29.18. I2 estimates
suggested that this was likely substantial in size,
ranging from 74.79% to 79.14% (Table 2).
Risk of bias
Many authors failed to report key design character-
istics to enable an accurate assessment of the risk of
bias, even after being contacted for clarification.

Meta-analysis of mindfulness based interventions for youth
249
 There was a low risk of bias in 32% of the studies for
random sequencing, 44% for allocation conceal-
ment, 18% for blinding, 35% for incomplete outcome
data and 53% for selective reporting. A high risk of
bias
existed
in
6%
of
the
studies
for
random
sequencing, 15% for allocation concealment, 35%
for blinding, 6% for incomplete outcome data and
24% for selective reporting. In all other cases the risk
of bias was unclear (see Figure 2). For the risk of bias
of individual studies, see Table 4.
Publication bias
For all 33 RCTs, Egger’s tests showed that publica-
tion bias was evident for Negative Behaviour and
Anxiety/Stress (Table 1). For the 17 RCTs with active
control groups there was evidence of publication bias
in the Mindfulness category only (Table 2).
Moderator analysis
For all 33 RCTs, individual, random effects meta-
regressions showed that age was a significant mod-
erator
of
improvements
in
Executive
Functions
(Q = 5.60, p = .018), with larger effect sizes in favour
of the MBI associated with older age. For duration of
MBI, total training hours was a significant moderator
of a reduction in Negative Behaviour (Q = 7.30,
p = .007), with larger effect sizes related to more
hours of training. Interestingly, Risk of bias score
had no significant effect on any outcome category.
For the 17 RCTs with active control groups, age
significantly moderated improvements in Negative
Behaviour (Q = 5.27, p = .021), with larger effect
sizes associated with younger age. Risk of bias score
significantly moderated measures of Mindfulness,
with larger effect sizes related to greater risk of bias
(Q = 4.36, p = .037). Total hours of MBI training had
no significant effect on any outcome category.
Discussion
This is the first meta-analysis where only data from
RCTs that examine the effects of MBIs on improving
the mental health, behaviour and cognition of young
people aged 18 years or younger, are included.
Including only studies that compare MBIs against a
control condition means that outcomes are guarded
against test–retest effects and the effects of matura-
tional changes in young people as these will be
common across the MBI and comparator conditions.
In addition, only using studies that adopt a random-
ized design ensures that there should be no system-
atic differences between groups.

 Furthermore, and novel to this meta-analyses, we
include subanalyses of RCTs that compare MBIs
against active comparison conditions (both attention
placebo controls and active intervention controls).
The combined risk of bias across the constituent
studies in this meta-analysis also appears to be
smaller than in previous reviews that included a
broader range of studies (e.g., Maynard et al., 2017),
although the true risk of bias remains unclear as
many of the included studies fail to adequately
report potential issues such as the methods used
for random sequencing and blinding.
All RCTs
When including all 33 RCTs, results showed that
MBIs lead to significantly greater improvements in
measures of Mindfulness, Executive Functions and
Attention, relative to the control conditions. This is
encouraging given that MBIs are hypothesized to
operate through improvements in both mindfulness
and cognitive processes that can have a downstream
effect on arguably more distal mental health and
wellbeing outcomes. Indeed, benefits of MBIs were
also evident in these latter outcomes, with postinter-
vention benefits on measures of Depression and
Anxiety/Stress and Negative Behaviours. For all sig-
nificant results, effect sizes were small. Indeed, when
using the current more rigorous selection criteria of
only including RCTs, the overall effect size here is .19
(Cohen, 1992), which is smaller than the average
effect sizes reported in previous meta-analyses (Zoog-
man et al., 2015 (es = .23); Zenner et al., 2014
(es = .41); Klingbeil et al., 2017 (es = .17 to .51);
Maynard et al., 2017 (es = .14 to .27)). This suggests
that by including studies with less methodological
rigour (e.g., lack of randomization), there may have
been an overestimation of the effects of MBIs in
previous meta-analyses (Savovi�
c et al. 2017).
Age significantly moderated the effects of MBIs on
Executive Functions, with greater relative benefits
following an MBI associated with older age. It is
possible that older adolescents benefit more than
younger children due to what Roeser and Pinela
(2014) describe as the ‘window of opportunity’.
Indeed, the period between 14–18 years is seen as
a key time for mindfulness to be effective due to
heightened brain plasticity (Giedd, 2008). Further-
more, this age window is also characterized by
increases in self-reflection, social-perspective taking
and a greater interest in understanding the self and
others (Blakemore & Mills, 2014; Harter, 1999;
Selman, 2003). More work is needed to explore
possible age-related effects on gains in executive
functions, particularly in younger children. The only
previous meta-analysis to consider if age moderated
the effects of MBIs showed nonsignificant effects,
though this analysis was based on an amalgam of all
outcome variables rather than focusing on individual
outcome categories (Zoogman et al., 2015).
The dose of MBI significantly moderated Negative
Behaviour with more training associated with fewer
negative behaviours. The previous, meta-analyses
provided no support for dose as a moderator of
effects, though once again moderation analyses were
considered across all outcomes, rather than exam-
ining individual outcome categories. The present
results are in line with previous studies with adults
that have reported that MBIs of longer duration
produce
greater
general
benefits
(e.g.,
Mathew,
Whitford, Kenny, & Denson, 2010; Parsons, Crane,
Parsons, Fjorback, & Kuyken, 2017).
RCTs with active control groups
When analysing the 17 MBI studies that used an
RCT methodology against an active comparison
group, the only significant effects for the MBI relative
to the control condition that were retained from the
wider analysis on all 33 trials, were Mindfulness,
Depression and Anxiety/Stress. For the Mindfulness
and
Depression
categories,
effect
sizes
were
approaching moderate in size, and for the Anxiety/
Stress category, the effect size was small. These
results are consistent with previous meta-analyses
with adults (e.g. Khoury, Sharma, Rush, & Fournier,
2015; Khoury et al., 2013), which show that MBIs
are particularly useful for improving measures of
mindfulness, stress, depression and anxiety, with
greater improvements in mindfulness associated
with larger improvements in measures of mental
health. However, it is important to note that the
beneficial effect of an MBI on the category of Mind-
fulness relative to an active control is moderated by
risk of bias such that studies with a higher risk of
bias produced bigger effect sizes. This suggests that
the results of less tightly controlled studies may be
artificially inflating the overall effect size.
The categories of Negative Behaviour, Executive
Functions and Attention no longer improved signif-
icantly following an MBI when with trials were
restricted to those including an active control inter-
vention. This perhaps indicates that studies with
passive control groups may erroneously inflate the
effects of an MBI on these outcome domains. Alter-
natively, it might be indicative of the smaller effect
sizes expected when MBIs are compared against a
true active intervention that trains the same targeted
outcomes as MBIs and we discuss this further below.
Finally, although Negative Behaviour was not
significantly reduced overall in the group of studies
including an active control condition, MBIs effects on
Negative Behaviour were significantly moderated by
age. This time younger children showed greater
improvements than older children/adolescents fol-
lowing an MBI. This suggests that, when using a
more robust trial design, although there is a lack of
support that MBIs reduce negative behaviour across
the age range studied, it is conceivable that they may
be useful in reducing negative behaviour in younger

 children (see Parker, Kupersmidt, Mathis, Scull, &
Sims, 2014; Schonert-Reichl et al., 2015). To test
this, researchers might want to consider comparing
how the negative behaviour of older and younger
children compare following MBIs in large-scale,
tightly controlled RCTs.
RCTs by specific control group type
When
RCTs
of
MBIs
are
further
disaggregated
according to the specific type of control group used
(e.g., wait-list, no contact, attention placebo control
and active intervention control conditions), the pat-
tern of findings was unexpected. Although, wait-list
controls unsurprisingly yielded the largest mean
effect size, the smallest (i.e., the smallest difference
between MBI and controls) emerged when comparing
MBIs against no contact control groups. Theoreti-
cally, comparing an MBI against a passive control
condition, such as a no contact group, presents a
greater opportunity for gains in the MBI than when
comparing it against an attention placebo or active
intervention control condition as the influence of
both nonspecific aspects of training and the Haw-
thorn effect are minimized (McCarney et al., 2007). It
is plausible here that disaggregating our studies into
these four smaller categories renders the categories
more susceptible to the influence of individual stud-
ies. Indeed, in this case it seems that the two large
studies by Johnson, Burke, Brinkman, and Wade
(2016, 2017) that compared an MBI against a no
contact control group and that produced small or
negative effect sizes could be driving the small effect
size in this category.
In general, several of the control group types are
somewhat underrepresented in the analysis. In par-
ticular wait-list controls (33 effect sizes) and active
intervention controls (45 effect sizes). This under-
representation drove our decision to combine the no
contact and wait-list controls and attention placebo
and active intervention controls for our primary
analyses. As the field of MBIs grow, future meta-
analyses will need to revisit the important issue of
control group type in relation to the size of effects.
Limitations
When all RCTs are included in the analysis, almost
all of the categories suffer from heterogeneity. The
presence of heterogeneity is indicative of a lack of
similarity between the included studies, in this case
perhaps with regards to the methodology used (e.g.,
different control groups). For the 17 RCTs with active
control groups, heterogeneity is less of an issue but
is still significantly present in both of the behavioural
categories.
There was also evidence of publication bias in the
sub-categories of Negative Behaviour and Anxiety/
Stress and in addition, for the RCTs with active
control groups, in the Mindfulness category. It is
important to highlight this as it suggests that the
studies included here, in the aforementioned cate-
gories at least, are systematically different to unpub-
lished studies. Specifically, there is an odds ratio of
2.3 for preferred publication of positive results
(Dubben & Beck-Bornholdt, 2005) suggesting that
there may be an overestimation of the positive effects
of MBIs. With respect to publication bias, a search of
unpublished manuscripts was completed but per-
haps partly due to the relatively exacting nature of
our inclusion criteria, only one of the unpublished
studies identified was eligible for inclusion in this
review (see Potek, 2012).
Even though RCTs are the gold standard research
design, there are still relatively few mindfulness
studies with children/adolescents that adopt them,
testifying to how early along the intervention devel-
opment
trajectory
MBIs
for
youth
are
(Medical
Research Council, 2000, 2008). As a consequence,
some of our categories are populated by as few as five
studies, which differ from one another in terms of
participant characteristics and the nature of the
active control group employed, making it difficult to
be confident about the robustness of some of the
findings arising from these analyses. Future studies
should, and most likely will as MBIs develop as an
intervention, consider inclusion of active interven-
tion control conditions in their design to provide the
most stringent test of the efficacy or noninferiority of
MBIs. Indeed, the decision to combine active inter-
vention and attention placebo controls was due to
the relatively low number of RCTs across these two
types of trial design. Many standard definitions of
control groups would view attention placebo con-
trols, although useful for controlling for certain
nonspecific effects of an intervention, as therapeuti-
cally inactive (Higgins & Green, 2011).
Another potential issue is that many studies choose
to test new MBI protocols rather than run replication
studies on established MBIs (see Felver et al., 2016
for a discussion). Indeed, of the 22 different MBI
protocols included in this review, only seven were
used in more than one study. Indeed, over 40% of the
MBI protocols included here were developed and
implemented by the researchers themselves, enhanc-
ing the likelihood of bias when those interventions are
evaluated by their developers (see Leykin & DeRu-
beis, 2009, for a discussion of allegiance effects).
Fewer than a third of studies included a measure
of mindfulness as an outcome even though it is
presumably viewed as a core mechanism of change
for MBIs. It is important for future studies to attempt
to measure mechanisms of change including mind-
fulness in order to enhance our understanding of
how MBIs might be working with respect to different
categories of outcome.
The outcome variables for the studies included
here were typically scores on self-report measures.
Although commonly used in psychological interven-
tion research, self-report measures by definition

 rely on participants giving answers that are honest
rather than socially acceptable, modulated by study
demand effects or designed to portray the respon-
dent in a favourable light (Podsakoff & Organ,
1986). Future studies would clearly be strengthened
if self-report measures are augmented with obser-
ver-rated measures and/or direct physiological or
behavioural measures of relevant outcome vari-
ables.
Given that the original rationale for developing
formal MBI protocols was to improve mental health
(MBSR; Kabat-Zinn, 1982; Kabat-Zinn, 1990), the
superiority of MBIs over active comparison condi-
tions for these outcomes is reassuring. However,
more work is needed that directly compares MBIs
with psychological and psychosocial interventions
aimed
at
reducing
mental
health
problems
or
increasing wellbeing – i.e., RCTs with true active
intervention controls – to provide a stronger test of
the utility of MBIs in this area. These trials will not
necessarily involve superiority trial designs. Demon-
strating the noninferiority of an MBI for these health
outcomes would be important given the putative
benefits of MBIs for broader aspects of cognition and
well-being.
Conclusion and future directions
This meta-analysis is the first to synthesize studies
that have used an RCT design to compare MBIs in
young people to a control condition. In addition,
this is the first meta-analysis to include separate
analyses of RCTs with active control groups. Across
all RCTs we found support for significant effects of
an MBI, relative to the comparison condition, for
outcome categories of Mindfulness, Executive Func-
tioning, Attention, Depression, Anxiety/Stress and
Negative Behaviours. Across the 17 RCTs with
active control groups, support for significant bene-
fits of an MBI was restricted to the outcomes of
Mindfulness, Depression and Anxiety/Stress. Effect
sizes for these significant effects ranged from small
to small-to-moderate. There was some indication
that age and dose of MBI moderated outcomes in
some categories.
Addressing the mental health needs of children
and adolescents has become an increasing focus in
schools (Carsley, Heath, & Fajnerova, 2015; McMar-
tin, Kingsbury, Dykxhoorn, & Colman, 2014), with
MBIs becoming a popular, and relatively cost-effec-
tive method of offering support (e.g., Felver et al.,
2016; Tan, 2015). This meta-analysis reinforces the
promise of using MBIs for improving the mental
health and wellbeing of youth when using the gold
standard RCT methodology. Future RCT evaluations
should incorporate scaled-up definitive trial designs
to further evaluate the robustness of MBIs in youth
(Medical Research Council, 2000, 2008), for exam-
ple, the ongoing MYRIAD trial (Kuyken et al., 2017),
with a focus on mechanisms of action to further
enhance evolving MBI protocols.

Key points
� Mindfulness based interventions (MBIs) are a popular way of attempting to improve the mental and
physical health outcomes of children and adolescents.
� This is the first meta-analysis of MBIs with youth composed exclusively of randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) including RCTs with active control groups – the gold standard in intervention studies.
� When using the gold standard research design results showed that MBIs are useful in improving
Depression and Anxiety outcomes, but not behavioural or cognitive outcomes,
� The meta-analysis advocates the use of MBIs for improving mental health in young people.
� Future RCT evaluations should incorporate scaled-up definitive trial designs to further evaluate the
robustness of MBIs in youth, with an embedded focus on mechanisms of action.
