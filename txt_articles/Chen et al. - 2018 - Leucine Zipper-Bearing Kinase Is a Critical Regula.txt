In Brief
Reactive astrocytes are recognized
increasingly for their role in CNS injury
and disease. Chen et al. find that leucine
zipper-bearing kinase (LZK) is a positive
regulator of astrocyte reactivity that
controls glial scar formation after spinal
cord injury. These findings have broad
implications for understanding injury
responses and promoting neural repair.

SUMMARY
Reactive astrocytes influence post-injury recovery,
repair, and pathogenesis of the mammalian CNS.
Much of the regulation of astrocyte reactivity, how-
ever, remains to be understood. Using genetic loss
and gain-of-function analyses in vivo, we show that
the conserved MAP3K13 (also known as leucine
zipper-bearing kinase [LZK]) promotes astrocyte
reactivity and glial scar formation after CNS injury.
Inducible LZK gene deletion in astrocytes of adult
mice reduced astrogliosis and impaired glial scar for-
mation, resulting in increased lesion size after spinal
cord injury. Conversely, LZK overexpression in astro-
cytes enhanced astrogliosis and reduced lesion size.
Remarkably, in the absence of injury, LZK overex-
pression alone induced widespread astrogliosis
in the CNS and upregulated astrogliosis activators
pSTAT3 and SOX9. The identification of LZK as a
critical cell-intrinsic regulator of astrocyte reactivity
expands our understanding of the multicellular
response to CNS injury and disease, with broad
translational implications for neural repair.
INTRODUCTION
Astrocytes have diverse functions in the healthy CNS and partic-
ipate in CNS pathophysiology. In the healthy CNS, astrocytes
provide structural and metabolic support, regulate neurotrans-
mitter uptake and synaptic transmission, and help maintain
the blood-brain barrier (Ben Haim and Rowitch, 2017; Khakh
and Sofroniew, 2015). Under pathological conditions, astrocytes
become reactive, undergoing a spectrum of phenotypic changes
from upregulation of molecular markers and cytoskeletal hyper-
trophy to cell proliferation (Gallo and Deneen, 2014; Liddelow
and Barres, 2017). Reactive astrogliosis (or simply astrogliosis),
a collective term for astrocytic responses to insults, is a common
feature across a wide range of neurological conditions, including
traumatic injury, stroke, epilepsy, and neurodegenerative dis-
eases (Liddelow et al., 2017; Pekny et al., 2016). Understanding
the role of astrogliosis and its molecular regulation will aid in the
design of therapeutic intervention to promote recovery and
repair following CNS injury and disease.
Following traumatic injury to the CNS such as a spinal cord
injury, astrocytes display a gradient of responses centered
around the lesion site (Burda and Sofroniew, 2014). Reactive as-
trocytes form a dense scar just outside the fibrotic lesion core,
which consists of mainly non-neural cells such as fibroblast-
like cells and macrophages. The role of reactive astrocytes and
the glial scar in recovery and repair after CNS injury is complex.
It is generally thought that the glial scar presents a physical bar-
rier and produces chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs)
that inhibit axon growth and regeneration (Bradbury et al.,
2002; Silver and Miller, 2004). However, akin to wound repair
following skin lesions, reactive astrocytes and the glial scar
also have beneficial roles in confining the injury site, repairing
the blood-brain barrier, and limiting the spread of inflammation
(Bush et al., 1999; Faulkner et al., 2004; Herrmann et al., 2008;
Sabelstro
¨ m et al., 2013; Wanner et al., 2013). Recent evidence
indicates that, contrary to common belief, the astrocyte scar
may even aid in axon regeneration (Anderson et al., 2016).
Despite the increasingly recognized importance of reactive as-
trogliosis in the pathogenesis and outcome of neurological con-
ditions, our understanding of its molecular regulation remains
limited, especially regarding cell-intrinsic mechanisms. We
have previously identified leucine zipper-bearing kinase (LZK)
(MAP3K13), a conserved mitogen-activated protein kinase
kinase kinase (MAPKKK) upstream of c-Jun N-terminal kinase
(JNK) in the MAPK pathway, as a neuron-intrinsic promoter of
axonal growth in cultured CNS neurons (Chen et al., 2016).
Here, we investigated the in vivo role of LZK after CNS injury.
We found that spinal cord injury induces LZK expression prom-
inently in astrocytes. Genetic gain and loss-of-function analyses
in mice indicated that LZK is an important positive regulator
of astrocyte reactivity and postinjury glial scar formation. Our
study opens new avenues to manipulate astrogliosis and

 to understand its complex roles in the pathogenesis of and re-
covery from CNS injury and disease.
RESULTS
Spinal Cord Injury Upregulates LZK Expression in
Astrocytes
LZK is normally expressed in the CNS of embryonic and adult
mice based on mouse transcriptomic data (Shen et al., 2012).
As the first step in characterizing the in vivo role of LZK in
mammalian CNS injury response, the expression pattern of
endogenous LZK was examined using immunostaining following
dorsal spinal cord crush injury (see Experimental Procedures). In
the uninjured spinal cord, low baseline expression of the astro-
cyte marker glial fibrillary astrocyte protein (GFAP) and LZK
were detectable by immunofluorescence (Figure 1A). Two weeks
after injury, GFAP was upregulated in astrocytes as expected
(Burda and Sofroniew, 2014; Sofroniew, 2014) (Figure 1A).
Concurrently, LZK immunoreactivity was markedly increased in

with GFAP, especially in the gray matter
(Figures 1A and S1A). These observations
indicate that injury increases LZK expres-
sion in astrocytes and raise the possibility
that LZK may be functionally involved in
the astrocytic response to CNS injury.

(GFAP-CreERT2;LZKf/f [LZK conditional

1C).
We

tamoxifen
to
adult
mice
at
ages
8–10 weeks during a 5-day period and waited for another
week before inducing spinal cord injury (see Experimental
Procedures). Following tamoxifen treatment, GFAP expression
in the spinal cords of uninjured mice was comparable be-
tween control (LZKf/f) and astrocytic LZK knockout (GFAP-
CreERT2;LZKf/f) mice (Figure S1). After spinal cord injury, astro-
cytic LZK expression was induced in the spinal cords of LZKf/f
control mice but not in GFAP-CreERT2;LZKf/f mice, verifying effi-
cient deletion of LZK in astrocytes (Figures 1D and S1B).
Focal trauma to the spinal cord in mice results in a GFAP-
sparse fibrotic lesion core surrounded by a GFAP-dense astro-
glial scar, which represents an extreme form of astrogliosis
that gradually tapers off at increasing distances from the lesion
core (Burda and Sofroniew, 2014). At 2 weeks after spinal cord
injury, at which time the glial scar is considered mature based
on previous studies in mice (Herrmann et al., 2008; Herrmann
et al., 2010; Wanner et al., 2013), we analyzed the status of
3588

 astrogliosis by its prominent features as follows: maturation of
the scar border as assessed by orientation of astrocytic pro-
cesses together with lesion size, upregulation of cytoskeletal
proteins GFAP and vimentin, and astrocyte proliferation (Sofro-
niew, 2014). In tamoxifen-treated LZKf/f control mice, cellular
processes of astrocytes were predominantly oriented parallel
to the fibrotic-astroglial border (Figure 2A). In mice depleted of
astrocytic LZK, astrocytes at the lesion border formed a less
compact scar border with astrocytic processes often perpendic-
ular to the lesion border (Figure 2A), which is characteristic of
impaired astrocyte-fibroblast segregation and scar formation.
Correspondingly, lesion size was increased by �50% in mice
lacking astrocytic LZK (Figure 2B). In control mice, spinal cord
injury resulted in an increase of �2- to 3-fold in GFAP immunore-
activity immediately adjacent to the lesion core, and GFAP upre-
gulation was diminished toward baseline at �1.5 mm away
from the injury site (Figure 2C). In comparison, within the same
region, such injury-dependent GFAP upregulation was dimin-
ished by �20% in mice lacking astrocytic LZK (Figure 2C). Like-
wise, injury-induced upregulation of vimentin, known to occur in
reactive astrocytes (Zamanian et al., 2012), was reduced by
�20% immediately surrounding the lesion core in mice lacking
astrocytic LZK (Figures 3A and 3C).
CNS injury induces astroglial proliferation within 2 weeks
following trauma, with the highest number of proliferating astro-
cytes present closest to the lesion site following spinal cord
injury (Burda and Sofroniew, 2014; Sofroniew, 2014; Wanner
et al., 2013). We identified proliferating astrocytes based on
immunofluorescence co-labeling of the cell proliferation marker
Ki67 and the astroglial nuclear marker SOX9 (Sun et al., 2017)
(Figure 3B). Seven days after spinal cord injury, the number of
Ki67+SOX9+ cells immediately surrounding the lesion site was
decreased by �40% in mice lacking LZK in adult astrocytes as
compared to control mice (Figures 3B and 3D). We also exam-
ined astroglial proliferation following bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)
incorporation into GFAP+ cells (Wanner et al., 2013) and
observed a 25% reduction in BrdU+GFAP+ cell number sur-
rounding the injury site in mice lacking astrocytic LZK (Figure S2).
Taken together, these observations indicate that following spinal
cord injury, loss of LZK in astrocytes impaired astrogliosis as
assessed by its hallmarks of GFAP/vimentin upregulation, astro-
glial scar formation, and astrocyte proliferation, thereby support-
ing LZK as an important regulator of reactive astrogliosis.
Inducible LZK Overexpression in Adult Astrocytes
Enhances Reactive Astrogliosis after Spinal Cord Injury
To complement the LZK loss-of-function analyses above, we
next conducted analyses of genetic gain of function for LZK after
CNS injury. To do this, we generated mice that overexpress LZK
in astrocytes upon tamoxifen treatment (GFAP-CreERT2;LZKOE)
(Figures 4A and 4B). In this transgenic line, the LZK coding
sequence is linked to that of the red fluorescent protein
tdTomato (tdT) through the T2A peptide, thereby enabling
fluorescent identification of LZK-overexpressing astrocytes. We
treated 8- to 10-week-old mice with tamoxifen and then induced
spinal cord injury (see Experimental Procedures). We were
intrigued that mice with astrocyte-specific LZK overexpression
had poor survival, with only 12% survival after 2 weeks post-injury

 (n = 26), compared to a 95% survival rate for control mice (n = 35)
that underwent the same procedures. Astrocytic LZK-overex-
pressing mice lost weight after tamoxifen treatment, even before
spinal cord injury. The cause of death remains to be determined.
In the injured spinal cords of astrocytic LZK-overexpressing
mice, a subset of GFAP+ astrocytes were tdT+ with intensely
upregulated LZK (Figure 4C), demonstrating induction of the
LZK-tdT transgene. As expected, control mice (tamoxifen-
treated LZKOE mice without GFAP-CreERT2) did not exhibit any
tdT expression (Figure 4C). Consistent with previous observa-
tions (Herrmann et al., 2008; Wanner et al., 2013), astrocytes
formed a compact scar 2 weeks after spinal cord injury in control
mice (Figure 4D). Astrocytic LZK-overexpressing mice also ex-
hibited a compact scar (Figure 4D). However, the average lesion
size in mice with astrocytic LZK overexpression was reduced to
�60% of that of the control mice, indicating that astrocytic LZK
overexpression led to a more compact injury site (Figure 4E). It is
striking that at the site of injury, LZK-overexpressing astrocytes
lined the lesion border, as depicted by the presence of GFAP and
tdT double-positive (GFAP+tdT+) astrocytes and their processes
enveloping the lesion core (Figure 4D, bottom panels). Immedi-

and control mice showed similar levels
of GFAP expression levels (Figure 4F,
zone 1). However, at 1.5 mm from the
injury site, where GFAP signal intensity
typically tapered toward baseline in the control group (38% of
peak GFAP expression as measured at the scar border), GFAP
intensity was sustained at �70% of peak levels in mice overex-
pressing LZK (Figure 4F, zone 6). Even beyond 2 mm from the
lesion, astrocytic LZK-overexpressing mice exhibited an almost
2-fold increase in GFAP levels compared to the control mice
(Figure 4F, zone 9). Consistent with this, in LZK-overexpressing
mice, astrocytes near the injury site displayed morphologies of
augmented hypertrophy, compared to control mice after spinal
cord injury (Figure 4C). A different surgeon was able to reproduce
this key finding of enhanced astrogliosis, leading to a more
compact injury site in astrocytic LZK-overexpressing mice (Fig-
ures S3A–S3C). LZK-tdT-overexpressing astrocytes densely
decorated the injury site and exhibited elongated processes
(Figure S3B), as previously ascribed to reactive astrocytes form-
ing the glial scar border (Wanner et al., 2013).
In summary, mice overexpressing astrocytic LZK reproducibly
exhibited enhanced astrogliosis and a more compact injury site
after spinal cord injury. Corroborating our results with the astro-
cyte-specific LZK knockout mice described above, these data
indicate that LZK promotes astrogliosis and glial scar formation
after CNS injury.

 LZK Overexpression in Adult Astrocytes Alone Induces
Widespread Astrogliosis in the Absence of CNS Injury
Given that overexpressing LZK in astrocytes enhanced astroglio-
sis after spinal cord injury, we next asked whether such an effect is
dependent on injury. Three weeks after the end of tamoxifen treat-
ment in adult mice, we examined GFAP expression in the CNS of
controls (LZKOE) and mice overexpressing astrocytic LZK (GFAP-
CreERT2;LZKOE). In the spinal cords of uninjured controls, baseline
GFAP expression was detectable in the spinal cords and espe-
cially in the white matter by immunofluorescence (Figures 5A
and 5B). Following induction of astrocyte-specific LZK overex-
pression, we observed a marked increase in GFAP immunoreac-
tivity throughout the spinal cord, with the most pronounced upre-
gulation detected in the gray matter, where only a low level of
baseline GFAP immunoreactivity was present in the control group
(Figures5Aand5B).Quantitativeanalysesrevealedthatastrocyte-
specific LZK overexpression led to an �2-fold increase in GFAP
immunoreactivity in the spinal cords of uninjured mice (Figure 5C).
At higher magnifications, co-localization of induced LZK and tdT
along with upregulated GFAP could be discerned clearly in the
spinal cords of uninjured GFAP-CreERT2;LZKOE mice (Figure 5D).
Such upregulation of GFAP immunoreactivity in uninjured
mice overexpressing astrocytic LZK was not restricted to the
spinal cord. In control mice, baseline levels of GFAP immunore-
activity were observed throughout the brain, with moderately
higher expression in several regions, including the hippocampus
and some white matter tracts (e.g., corpus callosum) (Figure 5E).
In contrast, astrocytic LZK overexpression led to a dramatic
increase in GFAP immunoreactivity in the cerebral cortex,
hypothalamus, and many other regions throughout the brain

 (Figure 5E). As in the spinal cord, increased GFAP upregulation
was most pronounced in the gray matter, likely because of the
higher expression of the LZK-tdT transgene there. Quantitative
analyses revealed that astrocytic LZK overexpression led to
an �10-fold increase in GFAP immunoreactivity in the cerebral
cortex, where baseline levels of GFAP in control mice were low
(Figure 5F). It is interesting to note that only a small subset
(�13%) of these GFAP+ astrocytes co-labeled with tdT, suggest-
ing that LZK overexpression may lead to both cell-autonomous
and non-cell-autonomous induction of astrocyte reactivity.

expression markedly increased vimentin
expression
and
astrocyte
proliferation
broadly in the CNS, with the latter as-
sessed by Ki67 and GFAP co-labeling (Fig-
ure 6). Therefore, astrocytic overexpres-

alone
was sufficient to
upregulate molecular markers of astroglio-
sis and to promote astroglial proliferation in
the absence of any injury.
LZK Is an Upstream Activator of
SOX9 and STAT3 with Mitogenic
Effects
To begin identifying downstream effec-
tors through which LZK promotes astro-
gliosis, we assessed the activation and expression of two key
transcription factors that were previously shown to regulate the
astrocytic response to spinal cord injury, SOX9 and signal trans-
ducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Genetic loss-of-
function studies previously implicated SOX9 in promoting
astrocyte reactivity and the upregulation of associated CSPGs
(McKillop et al., 2013). SOX9 expression levels in astrocytes
also are elevated after CNS insults as assessed with stroke
and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) models (Sun et al.,
2017). Outside the periventricular region, the central canal, and
neurogenic areas, SOX9 predominantly labels the nuclei of as-
trocytes (Sun et al., 2017). We performed SOX9 immunostaining
and detected an �10% increase in the number of SOX9+ cells in
3592

 the cerebral cortices and spinal cords of uninjured mice overex-
pressing astrocytic LZK (Figures 7A–7D). This was accompanied
by an �2-fold increase in SOX9 immunofluorescence intensity
per cell (Figures 7A–7D). Such an increase in SOX9+ cell number
was likely the result of increased astrocyte cell proliferation (Fig-
ures 6C and 6D). Thus, in the absence of any injury, overexpress-
ing LZK in astrocytes alone was sufficient to elevate both SOX9
levels in astrocytes and the number of SOX9+ cells.
STAT3, another astrogliosis-associated transcription factor that
acts in the Janus kinase (JAK)-STAT signaling pathway, has been
shown to mediate injury-dependent astrogliosis and glial scar for-
mation (Herrmann et al., 2008; Okada et al., 2006). Activation of
STAT3 can be detected by phosphorylation at tyrosine 705 (Herr-
mann et al., 2008), hereafter referred to as pSTAT3. We found few
pSTAT3+ cells or pSTAT3+GFAP+ astrocytes in the spinal cords of
uninjured control mice (Figures 7E, S3D, and S3E). In contrast, un-
injured mice with astrocyte-specific LZK overexpression had

an �10-fold increase in the number of
pSTAT3+ cells and pSTAT3+ astrocytes
(Figures 7E, S3D, and S3E), some of which
co-labeled with tdT (Figure 7E). After spinal
cord injury, increased numbers of pSTAT3+
cells and pSTAT3+ astrocytes also were
observed at the injury site and perilesional
region in mice overexpressing astrocytic
LZK, as compared with injured control
mice (Figures S3A, S3B, S3D, and S3E).
Previously, we identified JNK as the
main downstream effector of the LZK
signal pathway promoting axon outgrowth
in cultured CNS neurons (Chen et al.,
2016). Curiously, here, JNK activation
was rarely detected in LZK-overexpress-
ing astrocytes in the absence of injury
in vivo (Figure S4). Notably, overexpressing LZK in parvalbumin
(Pv)-positive neurons using the same inducible transgenic over-
expression line (Pv-Cre;LZKOE) did not cause animal death or
alteration in the gross morphology of Pv-expressing neurons in
the cerebellum (Figure S5), arguing against non-specific, toxic ef-
fects of LZK overexpression.
In summary, these data suggest that LZK promotes astroglio-
sis by upregulating SOX9 and activating STAT3, two known
regulators of astrocyte reactivity. Furthermore, JNK does not
appear to be a robust target of LZK in adult astrocytes, suggest-
ing cell-type-specific and context-dependent LZK signaling.
DISCUSSION
Reactive astrocytes are recognized increasingly for their impor-
tant contributions to injury response, disease pathogenesis,
plasticity, and repair in the CNS (Pekny et al., 2016). A better

 understanding of the molecular underpinning of reactive astro-
gliosis provides valuable tools to manipulate this process, un-
ravel its complex functions, and affect the outcome of a multi-
tude of neurological conditions. Our study revealed LZK to be
a positive, cell-intrinsic regulator of astrogliosis, as evidenced
by its ability to promote the expression of reactive astrocyte
markers, astrocyte cell proliferation, and maturation of the glial
scar. Notably, overexpressing LZK in astrocytes alone was suf-
ficient to drive widespread astrogliosis throughout the otherwise
unperturbed CNS. These data support LZK as a potential target
of astroglial manipulation for improving the outcome in a spec-
trum of CNS injuries and diseases.
Genetic loss and gain of LZK function in astrocytes decreased
and increased astrogliosis, respectively, as assessed by multiple
established features defining astrogliosis, demonstrating LZK as
a cell-intrinsic regulator of astrocyte reactivity. However, the
effect of LZK overexpression appeared to ‘‘spill over’’ to other
astrocytes: although only a relatively small subset of astrocytes
(�13%) in GFAP-CreERT2;LZKOE mice overexpressed LZK, as
assessed by expression of its reporter tdT, GFAP was systemi-
cally upregulated throughout the CNS, even in the absence of
an injury or other insult. Thus, LZK may promote astrogliosis
both cell autonomously and non-cell autonomously. It remains
to be excluded, however, that LZK-overexpressing astrocytes
may simply give rise to progeny that do not express the LZK-tdT
transgene. Following spinal cord injury, LZK-overexpressing as-
trocytes were found to line the lesion border with an elongated
morphology, which is consistent with the possibility that LZK
regulates the astrocyte response to a gradient of instructional
cues emanating from the lesion core (Burda and Sofroniew,
2014). The effects of astrocytic LZK overexpression on other
injury responses such as blood-brain barrier permeability and
the spread of inflammation remain to be investigated.
STAT3, SOCS3 (repressor of STAT3), and nuclear factor kB
(NF-kB) are among the key molecules previously shown to regu-
late astrogliosis and lesion size after spinal cord injury (Brambilla

 et al., 2005; Herrmann et al., 2008; Okada et al., 2006). SOCS3
deletion enhances glial scar formation and wound healing after
spinal cord injury; however, it is not known whether it is sufficient
to drive astrogliosis in the otherwise unperturbed CNS (Okada
et al., 2006). The ability to induce astrogliosis with LZK overex-
pression alone in the absence of any injury or other insult would
provide a new avenue to study the pathophysiological roles of
astrogliosis in CNS injury and disease (Pekny et al., 2016).
Furthermore, LZK overexpression in astrocytes led to a wide-
spread upregulation of pSTAT3, again suggesting that LZK acti-
vates the JAK-STAT pathway in both a cell-autonomous and
non-cell-autonomous manner. Likewise, astrocytic LZK overex-
pression upregulated the expression of SOX9, another molecule
that is implicated in astrocyte reactivity (McKillop et al., 2013).
Future studies are required to dissect the functional inter-
action between LZK and other signaling pathways in regulating
astrocytic reactivity. In contrast to the activation of JNK
(assessed by phospho-JNK [pJNK] levels) by LZK in CNS
neurons (Chen et al., 2016), pJNK was rarely detected in
LZK-overexpressing astrocytes. Instead, robust activation of
STAT3 and upregulation of SOX9 were observed in astrocytes
overexpressing LZK in vivo. This suggests cell-type-specific
LZK signaling cascades in response to neural injury. Our work
identifies LZK as a positive regulator of SOX9 and STAT3 path-
ways in the context of astroglial reactivity.
This work also raised an important question regarding the
functional consequences of LZK-regulated astrogliosis on neural
repair, especially considering that the role of reactive astrocytes
and the glial scar in axonal regeneration has been investigated
intensively (Anderson et al., 2016; Hara et al., 2017; Silver,
2016). Although LZK-regulated astrogliosis appears to promote
wound healing, toxicity from systemic LZK overexpression in as-
trocytes has hindered our assessment of the impact on post-
injury axon dynamics or behavioral recovery, which will likely
require a method to locally overexpress LZK in the spinal cord.
Given their vital roles in a variety of brain regions and the hetero-
geneity of both healthy and reactive astrocytes (Ben Haim and
Rowitch, 2017; Khakh and Sofroniew, 2015; Liddelow and
Barres, 2017), it is conceivable that LZK overexpression elicits
a multitude of astroglial responses with both beneficial and
detrimental consequences. However, LZK overexpression in
Pv-Cre;LZKOE mice did not lead to animal death or any overt
phenotype in Pv-expressing neurons, arguing against non-phys-
iological effects of LZK overexpression per se. The opposite
phenotypes in astrogliosis displayed by mice lacking or overex-
pressing astrocytic LZK further support the role of LZK as a crit-
ical regulator of the astroglial response to CNS injury.
In our previous work, we identified LZK as a neuron-intrinsic
promoter of axon growth and regeneration in cultured CNS neu-
rons (Chen et al., 2016). A similar effect of LZK on promoting
axon growth also has been reported with primary retinal ganglion
cells (Welsbie et al., 2017). The function of LZK in astrocytes re-
ported here illustrates its role as an injury sensor capable of
orchestrating a multicellular response to CNS injury. It would
be of significant interest to explore whether LZK-dependent
regulation of astrogliosis can be extended to other forms of
CNS insult, including diffuse damage, neuroinflammation, and
neurodegenerative diseases. Along these lines, whole-body
inducible deletion of dual leucine zipper-bearing linase (DLK, or
MAP3K12), a homolog of LZK, was recently reported to atten-
uate astrogliosis in a mouse model of ALS; however, the authors
suggested that this effect was the result of an indirect effect of
neuronal DLK (Le Pichon et al., 2017), because the evolutionarily
conserved role of DLK in neuronal response to injury is well
documented (Hammarlund et al., 2009; Miller et al., 2009; Shin
et al., 2012; Watkins et al., 2013; Welsbie et al., 2013; Yan
et al., 2009). Regardless, a multicellular role for the same
signaling molecule in mediating CNS response to insult under-
scores the importance of thoroughly understanding its cell-
type-specific functions before effective translational strategies
can be envisioned. The identification of LZK as a cell-intrinsic
signaling molecule regulating astroglial reactivity will allow for
the testing of important hypotheses regarding the complex roles
of astrocyte reactivity in CNS injury and disease.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Genetically Modified Mice
All mouse husbandry and experimental procedures were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of California
San Diego and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Both
male and female mice, ages 8–10 weeks, were used. LZK-targeted mutant
mice were generated through the UC San Diego Transgenic Mouse and
Gene Targeting Core using a mouse embryonic stem cell line obtained from
the Knockout Mouse Project (KOMP) Repository as described previously
(Chen et al., 2016). LZKf/f mice were generated by crossing mice carrying
the LZK-targeted allele to mice expressing germline flippase (FLP) recombi-
nase (Rodrı
´guez et al., 2000), followed by removal of FLP recombinase by
breeding to wild-type C57BL/6 mice. LZKf has two loxP sites flanking exon 2
where Cre-mediated excision is expected to result in a frameshift and thus a
null allele. These mice were crossed with the GFAP-CreERT2 line (Hirrlinger
et al., 2006) to generate GFAP-CreERT2;LZKf/f mice in C57BL/6 background
(N > 10) for this study. Transgenic LZK conditional overexpressing mice
(LZKOE) in FVB background were custom made by Applied StemCell. After
breeding to C57BL/6 for two generations, LZKOE mice were crossed with
GFAP-CreERT2 mice (Hirrlinger et al., 2006) in C57BL/6 background to
generate the GFAP-CreERT2;LZKOE line (see illustration of LZKf and LZKOE al-
leles in Figures 1 and 4 for more details). LZKOE mice were crossed with Pv-Cre
mice (Hippenmeyer et al., 2005) to generate the Pv-Cre;LZKOE line. Pv-Cre
knockin allele has the endogenous Pv promoter/enhancer elements directing
the expression of Cre recombinase, which will allow LZK overexpression in Pv+
cells.
General In Vivo Experimental Design
All of the surgical experiments, tissue processing, data acquisition, and quan-
tification were performed by a laboratory member blinded to genotype. For
experiments testing the effects of astrocyte-specific LZK deletion, 8- to
10-week-old GFAP-CreERT2;LZKf/f mice and their LZKf/f littermate controls
each were given 75 mg/kg/day tamoxifen by oral gavage for a total of 5
gavages (days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5). For experiments testing the effects of astro-
cyte-specific LZK overexpression, 8- to 10-week-old GFAP-CreERT2;LZKOE
mice and their LZKOE littermate controls each were given 75 mg/kg tamoxifen
by oral gavage every other day (days 1, 3, and 5), for a total of 3 gavages
(the dosage was reduced as compared with LZK conditional knockout mice
to alleviate animal loss). GFAP-CreERT2;LZKOE mice lose weight following
tamoxifen-induced LZK overexpression, leading to the death of some animals.
In all of the mice, 1 week after the last tamoxifen treatment, a surgeon blinded
to genotype performed spinal cord surgery. Two weeks after surgery,
brains and spinal cords were collected and subsequently processed for qual-
itative and quantitative histological evaluation. Along the same timeline, unin-
jured mice were perfused and analyzed 3 weeks after the last tamoxifen
treatment.

 Surgical Procedures
All of the animals underwent general anesthesia by intraperitoneal injection
of ketamine and xylazine. Using a surgical microscope (Zeiss OPMI 1FC),
laminectomy of one vertebra at thoracic level T8-T9 was performed. We
used a dorsal hemi-crush model as previously described by Chen et al.,
(2017). A pair of no. 5 Dumont forceps (Fine Science Tools) was then
used to compress the dorsal spinal cord at a depth of 0.7 mm across the
entire width of the cord for 5 s. This dorsal hemi-crush model allowed for
better survival following surgery as compared with full spinal cord complete
crush and thus was used throughout this study, especially given that mice
overexpressing astrocyte-specific LZK exhibited reduced survival even
without injury.
Statistical Analyses
Unpaired parametric t test or two-way ANOVA followed by post hoc t test using
GraphPad Prism software calculated the statistical significance in differences
between two groups. N represents the number of animals per genotype or
treatment. For exact values of n, see the figure legends and the Supplemental
Experimental Procedures.
