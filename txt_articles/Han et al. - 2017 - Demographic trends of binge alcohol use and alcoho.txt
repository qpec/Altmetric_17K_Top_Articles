Abstract
Background—Alcohol use is common among older adults, and this population has unique risks 
with alcohol consumption in even lower amounts than younger persons. No recent studies have 
estimated trends in alcohol use including binge alcohol and alcohol use disorders (AUD) among 
older adults.
Methods—We examined alcohol use among adults age ≥50 in the National Survey on Drug Use 
and Health (NSDUH) from 2005 to 2014. Trends of self-reported past-month binge alcohol use 
and AUD were estimated. Logistic regression models were used to examine correlates of binge 
alcohol use and AUD.

 Results—The prevalence of both past-month binge alcohol use and AUD increased significantly 
among adults age ≥50 from 2005/2006 to 2013/2014, with a relative increase of 19.2% for binge 
drinking (linear trend p<0.001) and a 23.3% relative increase for AUD (linear trend p=0.035). 
While men had a higher prevalence of binge alcohol use and AUD compared to females, there 
were significant increases in both among females. In adjusted models of aggregated data, being 
Hispanic, male, and a smoker or illicit drug user were associated with binge alcohol use, while 
being male, a smoker, an illicit drug user, reporting past-year depression, or mental health 
treatment were associated with AUD.
Conclusions—Alcohol use among older adults is increasing in the US, including past-month 
binge alcohol use and AUD with increasing trends among females. Providers and policymakers 
need to be aware of these changes to address the increase of older adults with unhealthy drinking.

1. INTRODUCTION
Alcohol is the most commonly used psychoactive substance by older adults (Moore et al., 
2009), and the most common substance involved among older adults entering substance 
abuse treatment (Arndt et al., 2011; Han et al., 2009). Older adults (typically ≥65) can have 
particular vulnerabilities to alcohol due to physiological changes in aging (Oslin, 2000), 
increasing chronic disease burden (Moore et al., 2006), and medication use (Moore et al., 
2007). This can place older adults at a higher risk for adverse outcomes from alcohol, and 
alcohol use can complicate the management of chronic disease (Moos et al., 2005). Higher 
quantities of alcohol use by older adults have been associated with functional impairments 
(Moore et al., 2003) and increased mortality risk (Holahan et al., 2014; Moore et al., 2007). 
This has led the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) to lower 
recommended drinking thresholds for adults age 65 and older (NIAAA, 2016).
Recent epidemiological studies on alcohol use by middle-aged and older adults from the 
2005–2007 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), estimated the prevalence of 
past-year alcohol use to be 51% for adults age ≥50, 56% for adults age 50–65, and 43% for 
adults age ≥65. The study also found the prevalence of alcohol dependence to be 2.7% and 
alcohol abuse to be 3.4% for adults age ≥50 (Blazer and Wu, 2011). The prevalence of binge 
drinking for men was estimated to be 19.6% and for women it was estimated to be 6.3% 
(Blazer and Wu, 2009). Cross-sectional data from the 2005–2006 National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey of non-institutionalized Americans estimated 14.5% of older 
drinkers (age ≥50) consumed alcohol above the recommended limits by the NIAAA, and 
11.7% reported past-year binge drinking (Wilson et al., 2014). A recent cross-sectional study 
of the 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System found a lower prevalence of binge 
alcohol use among adults age 45–64 at 13.3% and for adults ≥65 prevalence was estimated 
to be 3.8% (Centers for Disease Control [CDC], 2012). However, it was noted that the 
frequency of binge drinking was highest among binge drinkers age ≥65 with an average of 
5.5 episodes a month compared to all other age groups (CDC, 2012).

 Given the aging Baby Boomer generation, which has higher reported rates of substance use 
compared to any generation preceding it (Johnson and Gerstein, 2000; Kuerbis et al., 2014), 
we hypothesize that there have been increases in alcohol use, including binge drinking and 
alcohol use disorders among older adults. One study noted increases in the rates of alcohol-
related hospital admissions for older adults from 1993 to 2010 (Sacco et al., 2015). 
However, no studies have examined recent trends or changes in demographics shifts for 
alcohol use among older adults as the Baby Boomer generation continues to age.
Understanding demographic trends of alcohol use and alcohol use problems for older adults 
is vital for targeted public health screening and interventions. The aim of this study was to 
estimate the prevalence and to examine demographic trends of self-reported alcohol use -- in 
particular binge alcohol use and alcohol use disorders among older adults, and to determine 
correlates of use among older adults. To do this, we used cross-sectional data from the most 
recent ten years (2005–2014) of a nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized 
individuals in the US--the NSDUH, focusing on adults age 50 and older.
2. METHODS
2.1. Study Population
Data were utilized from the ten most recent cohorts (2005–2014) of NSDUH, an annual 
cross-sectional survey of non-institutionalized individuals in the 50 US states and the 
District of Columbia (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 
[SAMHSA], 2013). A different cross-section of participants is sampled each year and thus 
the years are independent of each other. NSDUH is a nationally representative probability 
sample of individuals living in households and the sample was obtained via four stages: 
Census tracts were first selected within each state, then segments in each tract were selected, 
then dwelling, and then respondents were selected for the sample each year. Surveys were 
administered via computer-assisted interviewing (CAI)—conducted by an interviewer and 
audio computer-assisted self-interviewing (ACASI). Sampling weights were provided by 
NSDUH to address unit- and individual-level non-response. Weights were adjusted to ensure 
that estimates are consistent with estimates provided by the US Census Bureau. Additional 
information regarding sampling and the survey can be found elsewhere (SAMHSA, 2013). 
The weighted interview response rates for 2005–2014 NSDUH ranged from 71.2–76.0%.
2.2. Measures
2.2.1. Alcohol use and binge alcohol use—Participants were asked how long it has 
been since consuming their last alcoholic beverage. We utilized recoded variables derived 
from this question indicating whether alcohol was reportedly used within the last 12 months, 
and within the last 30 days. They were also asked whether they have binged on alcohol 
within the last 30 days. Binge alcohol use was defined using SAMHSA's definition as 
drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion, which is defined as consuming this many 
drinks at same time or within a couple hours of each other (SAMHSA, 2013).
2.2.2. Alcohol use disorders—Those reporting alcohol use within the last 12 months 
were asked additional questions to determine whether they met criteria for abuse or

 dependence as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth 
Edition (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Although a diagnostic 
interview was not conducted, these questions were utilized as a proxy. A respondent was 
defined as having alcohol abuse if they reported a positive response to ≥1 DSM-IV abuse 
criteria and defined as having alcohol dependence if they indicated a positive response to ≥3 
DSM-IV dependence criteria. The variable used for past-year alcohol use disorder includes 
respondents diagnosed with both past-year alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence, which is 
consistent with SAMHSA NSDUH reports (SAMHSA, 2013).
2.2.3. Demographics and health-related variables—We examined age (age 50–64 
and >65, which were derived from predefined categories), gender, race (i.e., white non-
Hispanic, black non-Hispanic, Hispanic, other race), educational attainment (i.e., <high 
school, high school, some college, college or more), annual total family income (i.e., <
$20,000; $20,000–49,999; $50,000–$74,999; $75,000+), and marital status (i.e., married, 
widowed, divorced or separated, or never married).
Participants were asked to rate their general health and response options for perceived health 
were “excellent”, “very good”, “good”, “fair”, and “poor”. They were also asked if they had 
ever been informed by a doctor or other medical professional that they have had the 
following 12 chronic diseases: asthma, bronchitis, cirrhosis of the liver, diabetes, heart 
disease, hepatitis, hypertension (high blood pressure), lung cancer, HIV/AIDS, sleep apnea, 
stroke, and ulcers. We computed a sum variable and recoded this into a binary variable 
indicating multiple self-reported chronic conditions (2 or more vs. 0–1 chronic conditions). 
This cutoff was chosen because multimorbidity is commonly defined as the co-occurrence of 
two or more chronic conditions (Tinetti et al., 2012). With regard to mental health, 
participants were asked whether they had experienced a depressive episode or anxiety within 
the past year. They were also asked if they had received mental health treatment within the 
past year.
Past 12-month and past 30-day tobacco use were queried and tobacco was defined as 
cigarettes, chewing tobacco, snuff, cigars, and pipe tobacco. Likewise, participants were 
asked about 12-month and 30-day use of a variety of illicit drugs (e.g., marijuana, cocaine) 
and we utilized two indicator variables indicating whether use of any was reported.
2.3. Statistical Analyses
These analyses focused on participants age 50 and older, who represented about 9.2%–
16.2% of the full NSDUH sample each year. Since some outcomes of interest (e.g., heavy 
30-day alcohol use, alcohol abuse/dependence) were relatively rare, similar to previous 
analyses (Hasin et al., 2015; Jones et al., 2015), we aggregated years into pairs to increase 
power to detect trends over time. Specifically, we collapsed years into 2005–2006, 2007–
2008, 2009–2010, 2011–2012, and 2013–2014.
We first calculated descriptive statistics to estimate the weighted prevalence of self-reported 
past-year alcohol use of patterns across cohorts, as well as the prevalence of alcohol use 
patterns separately for each category of each covariate. We then calculated the absolute 
change over time by subtracting prevalence in 2013–2014 from prevalence in 2005–2006.

 We also calculated the relative change over time by dividing prevalence in 2013–2014 by 
prevalence in 2005–2006. We then estimated whether there was a linear association between 
binge drinking and alcohol use disorder and time within each category of each covariate.
We aggregated data from all years into a single cross-section to determine whether 
covariates were related to the two outcomes of interest—binge drinking and alcohol use 
disorder. Using binary logistic regression we first estimated odds of each covariate 
separately, which produced unadjusted odds ratios (ORs). We then fit all covariates 
simultaneously (including indicators for year) using multiple logistic regression. The 
adjusted ORs (AORs) represent the odds of each category with all else in the model being 
equal.
We weighted all analyses to account for the complex survey design. Since our analyses 
utilized data from 10 cohorts, we divided the weights by 10 to obtain nationally 
representative estimates. Stata SE 13 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, 2009) was used for all 
analyses, and survey (“svy”) commands were utilized to provide accurate standard errors 
using Taylor series estimation methods (Heeringa et al., 2010). Secondary analysis of this 
publically available data was exempt for review by the New York University Langone 
Medical Center Institutional Review Board.
3. RESULTS
Sample characteristics and alcohol use across cohorts are presented in Table 1. Tests for 
trends suggest that between 2005/2006 and 2013/2014, there were significant increases in 
prevalence of past-year alcohol use (from 60.0% to 63.0%, p<0.001) and past-month alcohol 
use (from 47.1% to 49.9%, p<0.001). The prevalence of past-month binge alcohol use 
among adults age 50 and older significantly increased from 2005/2006 to 2013/2014 from 
12.5% to 14.9% (p<0.001), representing a 19.2% relative increase. The prevalence of past-
year alcohol use disorder also significantly increased from 3.0% to 3.7% (p=0.035).
With regard to past-month binge alcohol use (Table 2), middle-aged adults (age 50–64) 
reported a significant increase over time (a 23.2% relative increase, p<0.001). Females had a 
significantly large increase in the prevalence of past-month binge drinking from 6.3% to 
9.1% (a 44.4% relative increase, p<0.001). Likewise, prevalence in past-month binge 
drinking significantly increased among white participants, those earning <$20,000 or >
$75,000, those with a high school education, those who were married or never married, 
respondents who reported very good or fair/poor health, had multiple chronic conditions, 
and those who received mental health treatment in the past year.
As shown in Table 3, older adults (age ≥65) experienced a significant increase in prevalence 
of past-year alcohol use disorders over time (a 40.0% relative increase, p=0.014). Female 
participants had a large significant increase in past-year alcohol use disorders (an 84.6% 
relative increase, p=0.001) with males remaining stable. Prevalence of alcohol use disorder 
also significantly increased among white participants, those with a high school diploma, 
those earning less than $20,000 per year, and those who were married. There was also an 
increase among those reporting that they are of fair or poor health.

 Table 4 shows results from the multivariable logistic regression model with past-month 
binge drinking as the outcome variable. Results from the adjusted model suggest that more 
recent study participants, younger participants, males, Hispanics (versus non-Hispanic 
whites), those reporting higher household incomes >$20,000, those who reported being 
divorced or separated, and those reporting past year use of tobacco or illicit drug had higher 
odds of reporting past-month binge drinking. History of multiple chronic conditions was 
associated with significantly lower odds of reporting past-month binge drinking (OR=0.79; 
95% CI: 0.73–0.84; p<0.001) along with participants who reported fair or poor health status 
(versus excellent) (OR=0.83; 95% CI: 0.73–0.93; p=0.003).
Table 5 reports results from the multivariable logistic regression model with past-year 
alcohol use disorder as the outcome variable. Results from the adjusted model show that 
younger (age 50–64) participants (versus older; >65), males (versus females), higher 
household income >$75,000, those who reported being divorced or separated (vs. married) 
and past year use of tobacco or illicit drug had higher odds of reporting past-year alcohol use 
disorders. In addition, past-year major depressive episode and respondents who received 
mental health treatment in the past year also had higher odds of alcohol use disorders.
4. DISCUSSION
The prevalence of alcohol use among older adults is increasing in the US; however, little is 
known about recent trends, demographic changes, and correlates of use. We found a 
significant increase in prevalence of past-month binge drinking and past-year alcohol use 
disorders in the US among older adults from a ten year period from 2005/2006 through 
2013/2014, with large relative increases in AUD among adults age ≥65 and binge drinking 
among adults age 50–64. The results in this study indicate some demographic changes in 
trends of unhealthy alcohol use.
Our study found that among women, binge drinking and alcohol use disorders increased 
greatly during the study period. With regard to binge drinking, we also detected significant 
increases among older non-Hispanic whites, but by 2013/2014 Hispanics had the highest 
prevalence for binge drinking relative to other races. Those reporting household incomes ≥
$75,000 also had significant increases and the highest binge drinking prevalence by 
2013/2014 compared to other household incomes. Regarding alcohol use disorders, there 
were significant increases among non-Hispanic whites and household incomes <$20,000. 
The significant demographic correlates of binge alcohol use and alcohol use disorders 
determined in this study including younger age, being male or not married, tobacco use, and 
illicit drug use, are similar to results of previous studies (Blazer and Wu, 2009, 2011; Choi et 
al., 2016; Moore et al., 2009). Our findings of high prevalence rates and correlates of 
Hispanic ethnicity with binge drinking corroborate with previous studies (Merrick et al., 
2008), although we found no significant trends during the study period for this population.
Aging is marked by physiological changes that can place older adults at higher risk for 
impaired function, chronic disease, increased medication use, and geriatric conditions (e.g., 
falls and cognitive impairment; Cigolle et al., 2007). While there is evidence that moderate 
alcohol use may be associated with decreases in morbidity and mortality among older adults

 (Kuerbis et al., 2014; Oslin, 2000; Thun et al., 1997), older adults with multiple chronic 
conditions are often particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of alcohol, especially 
when consuming alcohol in amounts exceeding NIAAA recommended drinking limits 
(Moore et al., 2006). In addition, there is a high prevalence among older adults who are 
prescribed medications that interact with alcohol (Breslow et al., 2015), which can lead to 
harmful effects (Moore et al., 2007). Binge alcohol use in particular may increase the risk 
for unintentional injuries (such as falls) and negatively impact chronic disease and chronic 
disease management (including cardiovascular disease) among older adults (CDC, 2015; 
NIAAA, 2000). Therefore, results from this study may raise concern given significant 
increases in binge alcohol use from 2005/2006 to 2013/2014 among older adults with self-
reported "fair/poor" health, and increases among adults with multiple chronic diseases. 
Recommendations have been suggested to lower recommended drinking limits based on 
comorbidities for older adults (Moore et al., 2006), which will become more important as 
the trend of increased binge alcohol use among older adults with multimorbidity may 
continue.
While the findings in this study continue to show that older men are more likely to drink at 
potentially unhealthy levels, the large increases among older women who reported binge 
drinking or were diagnosed with alcohol use disorders is alarming. Older women are at 
particular risk for experiencing adverse effects associated with alcohol use given the larger 
impact of physiological changes in lean body mass compared to men as well as unique 
social and psychological factors (Blow and Barry, 2002), and experience the adverse effects 
of alcohol at lower amounts (Wilson et al., 2014). In addition, compared to men, older 
women are more likely to be prescribed psychotherapeutic medications (Hohman, 1989; 
Mamdani et al., 1999) that can lead to severe adverse reactions when taken concomitantly 
with alcohol (NIAAA, 2015). A distinctive risk for women alcohol consumption has been 
associated with increased risk for some breast cancers (Hamajima et al., 2002; Zang et al., 
2007). Since older women generally drink less than men, they are less likely to be screened 
for or seek help for alcohol use problems (Blow and Barry, 2002). Our findings of a large 
increase in both binge alcohol use and alcohol use disorders among older women over the 
past ten years indicates an emerging public health problem. Health care providers need to be 
aware of this increasing trend of unhealthy alcohol use among older women, and ensure that 
screening for unhealthy alcohol use is part of regular medical care for this population.
For some demographic and health-related characteristics, results differed between bivariate 
and multivariate models, and between binge drinking and alcohol use disorders. For 
example, widowhood was associated with lower risks of binge drinking and alcohol use 
disorders in bivariate models compared to those who were married, but the difference was 
not significant when controlled for covariates. Those who are widowers may be older and 
have more comorbidities, highlighting the importance of adjusting for such factors in 
analyses of drinking among older populations. Further, in bivariate models, fair/poor health 
was associated with a lower risk of binge drinking compared to those in excellent health, but 
a higher risk of alcohol use disorder. When adjusted, those reporting fair/poor health 
remained at lower risk for binge drinking, and no significant relationship remained for 
alcohol use disorder. It is well documented that chronic health problems are associated with 
reducing and/or eliminating alcohol consumption among older adults (Moos et al, 2005; 
Han et al.

 Satre and Arean, 2005), and these results are generally consistent with those findings in that 
older adults with fair or poor health are less likely to engage in unhealthy drinking patterns 
(Geroldi et al., 1994; Hajat et al., 2004; Satre et al, 2007). However, such reductions may not 
apply to alcohol use disorders, which may be more chronic conditions requiring additional 
management in the presence of multiple health morbidities. We also note that these analyses 
raise important future directions of research. For example, bivariate analyses suggested that 
mental health problems and service utilization might also be increasing across time among 
older adults. The extent to which these trends are independent of trends in alcohol use or a 
consequence of such trends is an important future direction, as mental health challenges are 
an important part of the care for older adults.
4.1 Limitations
The NSDUH relies on self-report and therefore is subject to social-desirability bias and 
recall bias; although the survey attempts to limit the former via audio computer-assisted self-
interviewing (SAMSHA, 2013). Second, because NSDUH samples the civilian, non-
institutionalized population, it does not include active members on the military, homeless, 
incarcerated, or institutionalized adults who may have different alcohol use patterns than 
those surveyed. Third, the survey is cross-sectional and different participants were sampled 
each year of the study period; therefore, this study cannot establish causality. In addition, 
mental health may simultaneously be a cause, consequence, or correlate of alcohol use, and 
the cross-sectional nature of the NSDUH survey creates difficulties in teasing apart 
directionality of the associations. However, we recomputed models with and without mental 
health covariates and results did not change any associations of other covariates. 
Nonetheless, results on associations between mental health and substance use should not be 
interpreted with causal directions of effect implied. Finally, we utilized variables based on 
SAMHSA's definition for binge drinking as drinking 5 or more alcohol drinks on the same 
occasion for at least 1 day in the previous 30 days (SAMHSA, 2013). The NIAAA and the 
CDC, however, utilize a different cutoff for binge drinking, defined as a pattern of drinking 
that brings blood alcohol concentration to 0.08 g/dL, or 5 drinks for men and 4 drinks for 
women in roughly a two-hour period (NIAAA, 2004). The NIAAA also recommends lower 
thresholds for adults 65 and older: no more than 4 drinks on any given day for both men and 
women (NIAAA, 2016). Since our analysis used the higher cutoff for the binge drinking 
criteria for women and for older adults (≥65), our study is likely to have underestimated the 
prevalence for binge drinking among women and older adults compared to using the NIAAA 
cut offs.
4.2 Conclusion
This study is among the first to examine recent trends and demographic changes in binge 
alcohol use and alcohol use disorders among older adults in the US, and supports projections 
of large increases in older adults with substance use disorders who will need treatment (Han 
et al., 2009). Our findings demonstrate that alcohol use, binge alcohol use, and alcohol use 
disorders have continued to increase among older adults, particularly among females. We 
also found a significant increase in binge alcohol use among older adults with multiple 
chronic conditions. These national trends in alcohol use among these groups present distinct

 risks and challenges, and suggest the importance of screening these populations for binge 
alcohol use and alcohol use disorders.
