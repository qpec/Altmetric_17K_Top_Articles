Isolated tricuspid regurgitation: outcomes and 
therapeutic interventions
Erin A Fender,1 Chad J Zack,1,2 Rick A Nishimura1
AbstrAct
Isolated tricuspid regurgitation (TR) can be caused by 
primary valvular abnormalities such as flail leaflet or 
secondary annular dilation as is seen in atrial fibrillation, 
pulmonary hypertension and left heart disease. There is 
an increasing recognition of a subgroup of patients with 
isolated TR in the absence of other associated cardiac 
abnormalities. Left untreated isolated TR significantly 
worsens survival. Stand-alone surgery for isolated TR is 
rarely performed due to an average operative mortality of 
8%–10% and a paucity of data demonstrating improved 
survival. When surgery is performed, valve repair may be 
preferred over replacement; however, there is a risk of 
significant recurrent regurgitation after repair. Existing 
society guidelines do not fully address the management 
of isolated TR. We propose that patients at low operative 
risk with symptomatic severe isolated TR and no 
reversible cause undergo surgery prior to the onset of 
right ventricular dysfunction and end-organ damage. For 
patients at increased surgical risk novel percutaneous 
interventions may offer an alternative treatment but 
further research is needed. Significant knowledge gaps 
remain and future research is needed to define operative 
outcomes and provide comparative data for medical and 
surgical therapy.
IntroductIon
More than 1.6 
million Americans have at least 
moderate to 
severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR), yet 
fewer than 8000 tricuspid valve (TV) operations are 
performed annually in the USA.1–3 The aetiology of 
TR is divided into primary and secondary causes. 
Historically, primary TR was thought to be limited 
to patients with congenital heart disease and rarely 
observed in adults. Secondary TR is associated with 
pulmonary hypertension (PH), left-sided valvulop-
athy or myocardial disease. However, there is an 
emerging population of adult patients without left-
sided heart disease, PH or congenital abnormalities 
who nonetheless develop symptomatic isolated TR.
The incidence of isolated TR appears to be rising 
along with the prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) 
and intracardiac devices.4–6 This has prompted 
interest in corrective therapies; however, existing 
guidelines do not fully address management. In 
this article, we examine the natural history, presen-
tation and evaluation of isolated TR. Next, we 
review surgical guidelines, evaluate postoperative 
outcomes and propose a management algorithm for 
isolated disease. Finally, we discuss percutaneous 
devices and address areas for future research.
AetIology And pAthophysIology
Primary valvular disease accounts for 10% of cases 
of TR in adults. Patients with congenital disease 
may have primary TV disease such as in Ebstein’s 
anomaly, atrioventricular defects and myxomatous 
prolapse. Acquired primary conditions include 
endocarditis, rheumatic disease, carcinoid or flail 
leaflet caused by trauma. There is an increasing 
population of patients with isolated primary TR 
caused by endomyocardial biopsy or intracardiac 
leads.7–9 Intracardiac leads can perforate or adhere 
to leaflets, entangle the chordal apparatus or 
impinge leaflets. In a series of patients undergoing 
de novo device implantation, the development 
of ≥2+  
TR was reported in 38% of patients.9
Secondary TR results from annular dilation and 
leaflet tethering leading to malcoaptation (figure 1, 
online supplementary video 1). Secondary TR 
commonly develops in response to right ventric-
ular (RV) remodelling due to PH, which is the 
final common pathway of both intrinsic pulmo-
nary vascular disease and left-sided myocardial or 
valvular disease. The resultant pressure overload 
causes ventricular enlargement, papillary muscle 
displacement, leaflet tethering, and annular flat-
tening and dilation (figure 2). A similar pattern of 
secondary TR occurs in diseases of the myocar-
dium where RV dilation is the dominate mech-
anism, such as with dilated cardiomyopathies, 
RV infarction and arrhythmogenic RV dysplasia. 
Chronic volume overload of the RV can also cause 
secondary TR, as it occurs with intracardiac shunts 
or high-output states. In about 10% of secondary 
TR no cause of the regurgitation can be identified, 
which has been termed ‘idiopathic’ TR.5 8 Patients 
with idiopathic disease tend to be older with a high 
prevalence of AF.8 10 Echocardiographic studies of 
idiopathic TR in patients with AF have identified 
extreme annular dilation as the driving mecha-
nism, suggesting AF may be a cause rather than a 
consequence of the TR.10 Figure 3 outlines the aeti-
ologies of primary and secondary TR. We discuss 
herein isolated TR in the absence of other aetiolog-
ical factors.
presentAtIon And evAluAtIon
The presentation of isolated TR is characterised by 
the physical finding of an elevated venous pressure 
with systolic pulsatility indicating a high right atrial 
(RA) pressure and large C-V wave. This is followed 
by development of right heart failure (neck fullness, 
hepatomegaly, oedema and ascites) and low cardiac 
output (fatigue). Exertional dyspnoea results from 
enhanced ventricular interaction with the dilated 
RV causing poor effective operative compliance of 
the left ventricle (LV).11 Hepatic and renal failure 
results from venous congestion and low perfusion 
pressure.12 13 Patients with isolated severe TR will 
present with right heart failure despite normal LV

systolic function, left-sided valves and pulmonary pressures. 
Similar findings occur in constrictive pericarditis and restrictive 
cardiomyopathy, which must be considered in the differential 
diagnosis. A history of long-standing AF or a prior intracardiac 
device should raise the suspicion of severe isolated TR.
echocArdIogrAphIc Assessment
A comprehensive two-dimensional and Doppler echocardio-
gram should be performed in all patients in whom severe TR 
is suspected to confirm the diagnosis of severe TR as well as 
elucidate its aetiology. The morphology of the TV
, annular size, 
and RV size and function should be assessed. The echocardio-
graphic criteria for severe TR include a central jet area >10 
cm2, 
proximal isovelocity surface area >0.9 
cm, vena contracta diam-
eter >0.7 
cm, effective regurgitant orifice area ≥40 
mm2 and 
regurgitant volume ≥45 
mL.14 15 Additional criteria include a 
dense TR continuous wave Doppler signal with a ‘dagger-shape’ 
due to rapid pressure equalisation between the RA and RV
, a 
dilated inferior vena cava and systolic reversals in the hepatic 
veins (figures 1 and 4). It may be difficult to determine the mech-
anism of TR, particularly if device leads cause acoustic shad-
owing.16 Three-dimensional views can elucidate the relationship 
between the valve and device leads, localise prolapse or flail and 
aid in measurement of annular dimensions.10 16 17
nAturAl hIstory
The clinical impact of TR was first established in patients with 
significant left-sided heart disease where the presence of TR 
worsened survival.18 The importance of isolated TR was first 
described in 2004.4 In a cohort study of 5223 patients, the 
presence of severe TR was associated with decreased survival 
after adjustment for PH and ejection fraction (HR 1.31, 95% 
CI 
1.05 to 1.66). In a series of 60 patients with isolated flail, an 
excess mortality of 3.8% per year was observed (P=0.02).19 
In an observational study of patients with new TR following 
cardiac device implantation, ≥2+  
TR was independently asso-
ciated with all-cause mortality (HR 1.75, 95% 
CI 1.01 to 3.02, 
P=0.047).9 Similarly, a 2014 study of 68 subjects with isolated 
severe secondary TR demonstrated worse long-term survival 
(HR 2.67, 95% 
CI 1.66 to 4.23).5 These series indicate that even 
in the absence of significant cardiopulmonary comorbidities, 
isolated TR adversely impacts survival.
current guIdelIne recommendAtIons for treAtment
Most patients with symptomatic TR are managed with therapies 
targeted towards the underlying disease process and diuretics to 
address volume overload.20 While diuretics may temporise symp-
toms, it is unclear if they alter disease progression, particularly 
in patients with primary valve disease. Therefore, TV surgery is 
the definitive therapy for severe symptoms. Current guidelines 
for surgery are reviewed in table 1.20 21 Most recommendations 
are targeted at patients undergoing concomitant aortic or mitral 
operations. These recommendations are based on the findings 
that the size and configuration of the TV will not reliably return 
to baseline after relief of RV overload.20 Furthermore, reopera-
tion for isolated TR after previous sternotomy is associated with 
significant in-hospital mortality.22 There is a paucity of recom-
mendations for surgery in patients with isolated TR. Existing 
recommendations are based on limited data in young otherwise 
healthy patients with primary TV flail.19 However, patients with 
flail are fundamentally different from those with isolated TR due 
to a device lead or idiopathic secondary TR associated with AF. 
These latter patients tend to be older with more comorbidities.

tricuspid regurgitation. Panel (A) demonstrates right ventricular and 
atrial enlargement with subsequent leaflet malcoaptation. Panel (B) 
shows a broad-based regurgitant jet across the tricuspid valve by 
colour-flow Doppler. Panel (C) highlights the classic ‘dagger-shaped’ 
continuous wave Doppler pattern of the regurgitant jet which results 
from rapid pressure equalisation in the right atria and ventricle. Panel 
(D) demonstrates the continuous wave Doppler pattern of systolic 
reversals observed in the hepatic veins.
figure 2 Secondary tricuspid regurgitation is typically mediated by 
right ventricular and annular dilation with resultant flattening of the 
normal ‘saddle-shaped’ configuration of the tricuspid valve.

review
Due to a lack of outcomes literature, the management of isolated 
TR is not directly addressed by current guidelines.
technIques And outcomes of tv surgery
The selection of a valve repair versus replacement is largely 
driven by anatomic factors, including the extent of leaflet 
damage and degree of annular dilation. When feasible, valve 
repair may be preferred due to the risks of prosthetic valve 
thrombosis, bioprosthetic valve degeneration and long term anti-
coagulation.23 24 Repair is generally favoured in patients under-
going left-sided surgery as these techniques can be accomplished 
quickly to minimise bypass time.20 25 It is estimated that 73% of 
TV operations are repairs, with 88% performed at the time of 
left-sided valve surgery.1 The most common surgical techniques 
are reviewed in figure 5.
Recurrent ≥3+  
TR in the months following repair occurs 
in 3%–14% of patients with the incidence steadily increasing 
over time and affecting up to 20% of patients by 5 years.22 26 27 
This risk appears to be lower in patients treated with a rigid 
annuloplasty band. Reoperation for recurrent TR is unusual, 
but is associated with up to 37% in-hospital mortality.22 28 Risk 
factors for recurrence include baseline regurgitant severity, PH, 
LV dysfunction, RV device leads, leaflet tenting and degree of 
annular dilation.22 29 30
In patients with extreme annular dilation, previous failed 
TV repair or leaflet abnormalities, tricuspid valve replacement 
(TVR) may be required.25 31 Operative mortality in TVR is 
often reported to be higher than repair; however, this may be 
confounded by a greater number of comorbidities in this popula-
tion. In a propensity score-matched study of 68 pairs of patients 
(approximately half of whom underwent isolated surgery), no 
differences were observed in surgical mortality after matching 
(13% for TVR vs 18% for repair, P=0.64), suggesting when 
imbalances in comorbidities are adjusted for that operative 
mortality is similar.24
The choice of bioprosthetic versus mechanical valves has 
generated much debate. Bioprosthetic valves in the tricuspid 
position may be more durable than bioprosthetics in the mitral 
position, perhaps due to lower pressures and velocities.32 Advan-
tages to bioprostheses include a lower risk of valve throm-
bosis and avoidance of anticoagulation; however, there is up 
to a 7% risk of severe bioprosthetic degeneration at 7–8 years 
requiring stand-alone redo TVR.33 34 Conflicting data have been 
published on long-term outcomes, with survival being similar, 
worse or improved with a bioprosthesis versus a mechanical 
figure 3 The aetiology of tricuspid regurgitation can be divided according to the presence or absence of organic valvular disease. Patients with 
isolated primary or secondary tricuspid regurgitation (highlighted in the red boxes) represent an emerging patient population about whom little is 
known. AF, atrial fibrillation; ARVD, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia; AV, aortic valve; DCM, dilated cardiomyopathy; L TGA,  L-transposition 
of the great arteries; RV, right ventricle.
figure 4 Simultaneous measurement of the tricuspid regurgitation 
jet by continuous wave Doppler and haemodynamic catheterisation 
demonstrates several key findings. Severe regurgitation results in rapid 
pressure equalisation between the right ventricle and right atrium giving 
the continuous wave Doppler signal a ‘dagger-shaped’ appearance. 
Additionally, the peak regurgitant velocity is low, which excludes 
significant pulmonary hypertension as a cause of the regurgitation. The 
haemodynamic tracing is notable for ventricularisation of the right atrial 
tracing, and marked elevation of the right atrial pressure with a large 
C-V wave. RA, right atrium; RV, right ventricle; PG, pressure gradient.

prosthesis.35–38 Overall, there is no definite survival benefit 
of a mechanical versus a bioprosthetic valve. The final choice 
should be a shared decision between the patient and the physi-
cian. However, in older patients the lower rate of structural 
deterioration and possible future need for a pacemaker favour 
a bioprosthetic valve.
While surgery is the only definitive treatment for isolated 
TR, it is rarely performed. Of the 4000–8000 TV operations 
performed annually in the USA, roughly 80% are at the time of 
left valve surgery.1 2 26 Stand-alone surgery makes up only 20% 
of operations, and many surgeries are performed for indica-
tions such as endocarditis. The rarity of stand-alone surgery for 
isolated TR may result from concerns over in-hospital mortality 
(8%–10% in most series) and uncertainty surrounding long-term 
outcomes. Due to small sample size most studies span multiple 
decades and include patients undergoing left-sided heart surgery. 
This has resulted in widely variable estimations of in-hospital 
mortality with higher mortality associated with multivalvular 
surgery, advanced heart failure and redo sternotomy.1 19 22 38–44
Few studies have focused on the outcomes of surgery for 
isolated TR and these typically include heterogeneous patient 
populations (table 2). Additionally, there is a lack of comparative 
outcomes for medically and surgically treated patients. To date, 
only a single study has compared long-term survival in patients 
with isolated TR treated with medical therapy versus surgery. 
In a series of 45 pairs of propensity score-matched patients 
(66% secondary TR, 33% primary TR) treated with stand-alone 
surgery, there was a non-significant trend towards improved 
survival in the surgical patients (HR 0.29, 95% 
CI 0.08 to 1.10, 
P=0.07).41
While there are little data on long-term postoperative survival, 
studies have consistently demonstrated surgery can improve

symptoms.19 40 44–46 In a series of 33 patients with isolated 
TV flail, 88% of operative patients experienced symptomatic 
improvement.19 Similarly, a study of 34 patients with previous 
left-sided valve surgery undergoing stand-alone TV surgery 
demonstrated improved New York Heart Association functional 
class in 85% of operative patients, including 59% of whom had 
isolated secondary TR.44
predIctors of outcomes for tv surgery
Regardless of which series is examined, outcomes of TR surgery 
are worse than what is seen in mitral or aortic operations. 
Surgical mortality may be adversely impacted by the practice of 
delaying operative interventions, thereby allowing for the devel-
opment of RV dysfunction and end-organ damage. For the aortic 
and mitral valves, the timing of surgical referral is based on an 
integration of symptoms, disease severity and early markers of 
LV dilation or dysfunction.20 There are little data to base timing 
of surgery for patients with severe TR, particularly those with 
isolated disease.
Several studies have examined the relationship between RA 
pressure and RV function with outcomes in patients undergoing 
TR surgery. An analysis of 260 patients treated surgically for 
secondary TR (the majority of whom underwent combined left 
valve surgery) found RA pressure was independently associated 
with hospital death (HR 5.6, 95% 
CI 1.7 to 78.0, P=0.01), with 
a mortality rate of 28% for patients with a preoperative RA 
pressure ≥15 
mm Hg versus just 5% in patients with a pressure 
<15 
mm Hg.47 RV dysfunction represents an advanced stage of 
chronic TR. In patients undergoing stand-alone TR surgery, RV 
end-systolic dimension, RV end-systolic area and the RV index 
of myocardial performance have all been associated with 
survival free of death, heart failure, cardiac readmissions, heart 
transplant or TV reoperation.5 39 40 These findings suggest RA 
pressure and RV function are key determinates of postoperative 
outcomes. As with all surgeries for valve disease, severe symp-
toms are associated with adverse short and long-term outcomes.
recommendAtIons for treAtment of IsolAted tr
Treatment of patients with severe isolated TR is based on several 
clinical observations:
1. ‘Severe TR begets severe TR.’ Progressive RV dysfunction 
drives further annular dilatation and results in more severe 
TR.
2. Diuretics may be effective in treating right heart failure in 
the early stages of isolated secondary TR and may potentially 
interrupt this cycle by lowering RA pressure.
3. Medical therapy will not reverse progressive RV dysfunction 
in severe isolated primary TR.
4. Isolated secondary TR associated with AF may improve with 
conversion to sinus rhythm.
5. Once severe right heart failure symptoms develop, if the TR 
remains untreated there is progressive clinical deterioration 
with development of end-stage liver and kidney failure.
6. Surgical intervention can improve the symptoms of right 
heart failure, but there are no data on enhanced survival in 
patients with isolated TR.
The current high mortality associated with surgery for isolated 
TR may be in part related to late surgical referral at which time

severe RV dysfunction and end-organ damage have already 
occurred.
Our recommendations for treatment of patient with severe 
isolated TR are shown in figure 6.
In patients without right heart failure symptoms surgical 
intervention is not recommended. However, it is reasonable to 
try diuretics if RA pressure elevation is seen on examination as 
diuretics may interrupt the cycle of ‘severe TR begets severe TR.’ 
Conversion to sinus rhythm may decrease the severity of TR in 
patients with persistent AF.
It is those patients with severe isolated TR and right heart 
failure who should be considered for surgical intervention. For 
patients with severe primary TR (frequently associated with 
intracardiac leads), surgical intervention may be indicated as this 
represents a structural problem which diuretics will not address. 
There have been reports of successful treatment of TR with lead 
extraction.7 However, in most cases the exact mechanism of the 
device-induced TR is unclear, and lead extraction could further 
damage the valve. Our current approach is surgical repair or 
TVR with exteriorisation of the lead outside the valve ring. In 
patients with isolated secondary TR an attempt to reduce annular 
size with diuretics or conversion to sinus rhythm for those with 
persistent AF may be effective. If symptoms remain surgical 
intervention is recommended prior to the onset of severe RV 
dysfunction, hepatic or renal dysfunction. Whether surgery may 
be effective at an earlier stage prior to the onset of symptomatic 
right heart failure remains to be determined.
percutAneous InterventIons
The rarity of surgery has created a large population in whom 
percutaneous treatments could provide a viable alternative. No 
large experience exists for these devices but early studies are 
under way. Devices fall into two categories: transcatheter valves 
and coaptation devices48 (figure 7). Transcatheter valve replace-
ment is usually performed within a previously placed biopros-
thetic valve (‘valve-in-valve’), or as a stented valve implanted in 
the inferior vena cava and superior vena cava.48 49 Devices aimed 
at improving coaptation include off label use of the MitraClip 
(Abbot Vascular, Menlo Park, CA), a percutaneous annuloplasty 
system (TriAlign, Mitralign, Tewksbury, MA) and a spacer device 
(FORMA Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA), which occupies 
the regurgitant orifice. The extent to which these devices result 
in a clinically meaningful improvement is not established and 
requires further research before these techniques can be adopted 
into clinical practice.
AreAs for further reseArch
Our understanding of the management of isolated secondary TR 
is lacking in three key areas: identification of patients for surgical 
intervention, isolated TR surgical outcomes in the contemporary 
era and comparative survival analyses for medical and surgical 
patients.
Preoperative RV size and function are associated with postop-
erative outcomes; however, threshold criteria for valve interven-
tion are lacking.20 Similar to what is seen in the LV with mitral 
regurgitation, severe TR may mask early RV dysfunction. Overt 
RV dysfunction represents an end-stage condition and the prog-
nosis cannot be altered surgically. Therefore, identification of 
echocardiographic markers of early RV dysfunction are needed 
to guide surgical referral.
Similarly, our understanding of surgical outcomes in patients 
with isolated TR is limited. Most series contain a heteroge-
neous population treated over decades and therefore have 
limited generalisability. Surgical referral for isolated TR is 
often delayed until the onset of frank right heart failure with 
end-organ damage which then further increases perioperative 
mortality. Efforts to define operative risk for truly isolated 
disease are critical to aid in decision-making, and to act as a 
benchmark against which studies of early operation can be 
compared.
A final, but major, limitation of existing surgical data is the 
paucity of comparative outcomes. Upfront operative mortality 
is high. Therefore, establishing long-term survival relative to 
medical therapy is critical to understanding the risks and benefits 
of surgery. A randomised trial of early surgery for isolated TR 
would fill an important gap in the literature.
conclusIons
Isolated severe TR results in progressive right heart failure and 
adversely impacts survival. Surgery remains the only definitive 
treatment but is rarely performed. There are little data to guide 
management of isolated TR; however, surgery is reasonable in 
patients with right heart failure who are at low operative risk 
prior to the development of RV dysfunction and end-organ 
damage. Further research is needed to identify markers of 
disease progression and to aid in the optimal timing for surgical 
referral.
figure 7 Multiple percutaneous devices are in development for 
the treatment of tricuspid regurgitation. Panel (A) is the FORMA 
device, a tricuspid spacer which occupies the regurgitant orifice and 
provides a surface against which coaptation can occur. Panel (B) 
demonstrates the TriAlign, which percutaneously reproduces a surgical 
Kay bicuspidisation. Panel (C) shows the MitraClip being used in 
the tricuspid position. Panel (D) demonstrates a stented caval valve 
implanted in the inferior vena cava.
