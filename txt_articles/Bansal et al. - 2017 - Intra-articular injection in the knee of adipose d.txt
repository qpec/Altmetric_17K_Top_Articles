Abstract 
Background: Stromal vascular fraction (SVF) can easily be obtained from a mini-lipoaspirate procedure of fat tissue 
and platelet rich plasma (PRP) can be obtained from peripheral blood. We evaluated the safety and preliminary effi-
cacy of administering SVF and PRP intra-articularly into patients with osteoarthritis grade 1 and 2.
Methods: A total of ten patients underwent a local tumescent liposuction procedure to remove approximately 
100 ml of fat tissue from the abdomen. SVF was isolated using an enzyme digestion and resuspended in PRP for 
intra-articular injection in the knee. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) 
score and six-minute walk distance (6MWD) were used to evaluate clinical effects and included measure of patient’s 
subjective assessment of pain, joint mobility, and physical disability. WOMAC score, 6MWD and laboratory tests were 
repeated at 3 and 6 months and 1, 1.5 and 2 years. XRAY and MRI were completed at 1 year.
Results: The average total WOMAC score was 64 at baseline and significantly reduced to 52 at 3 months, 46 at 
6 months, 42 at 1 year, 38 at 1.5 years, and 41 at 2 years. Patients walked an average of 1310 feet at baseline and dem-
onstrated a statistically significant improvement at 3 and 6 months and 1, 1.5, and 2 years post treatment. Cartilage 
thickness as determined by MRI improved by at least 0.2 mm in six patients, was unchanged in two patients and 
decreased by at least 0.2 mm in two patients.
Conclusions: Overall, all of the patients were pleased with the treatment results. They reported a reduction in pain 
levels, especially after 3 months. More importantly, the procedure demonstrated a strong safety profile with no severe 
adverse events or complications reported.

Background
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease charac-
terized by the slow progressive destruction of articular 
cartilage accompanied by changes to synovium and sub 
chondral bone, degeneration of ligaments and menisci 
and hypertrophy of the joint capsule [1, 2]. The patho-
genesis is usually characterized by severe inflammation, 
recruitment of inflammatory cells, pro inflammatory 
cytokine production and activation of proteinase that 
results in extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation and 
ultimately apoptotic cell death of differentiated chondro-
cytes. OA is influenced by genes, environment (e.g. aging

and obesity) and local trauma (e.g. consequences of joint 
injury/joint laxity or mal-alignment). These factors and 
more may contribute to the pathological process involved 
in the degeneration of the knee [3, 4].
Typical treatments include weight reduction, rest, exer-
cise, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), 
intracellular glucocorticoid injections, visco supple-
ments, physical therapy and bracing. These modes of 
treatments are usually palliative and merely provide 
symptomatic relief from pain, failing to prevent cartilage 
damage and subsequent destruction of other joint tissues 
[5–7].
Surgical methods of repair include the transplantation 
of osteochondral grafts, microfracture, and autologous 
chondrocyte implantation. All of these techniques are 
limited to the repair of focal lesions. According to con-
trolled clinical trials, arthroscopic surgery, autologous 
chondrocyte implantation or microfracture have limited 
long term effect on the treatment of OA [7, 8]. The chal-
lenge for researchers to develop disease-modifying OA 
treatments is, therefore, of paramount importance. Adult 
mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as a can-
didate cell type with great potential in regenerative medi-
cine [9]. MSCs are being investigated as a regenerative 
biologic agent because of their ability to differentiate into 
multiple tissue types and to self-renew [10, 11].
The paracrine activity of MSCs is thought to be one 
of the major means by which these cells mediate anti-
inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, anti-fibrotic, angiogenic, 
mitogenic and wound healing properties. The complex 
interplay of the biological mediators secreted by MSCs 
has been shown to be important in regulating regen-
eration of a variety of damaged or diseased organs and 
tissues of the body. It has also been shown that the pre-
curser to the MSC is the pericyte which are the cells pre-
sent on the microvessels and capillaries throughout the 
body. These cells become “activated” when an injury is 
recognized and detach to become medicinal MSCs. An 
immune-modulatory effect is initiated where other cells 
are called to help with the healing process while other 
secreted molecules will establish a regenerative microen-
vironment by setting up a trophic field [12].
MSCs are also capable of suppressing an immune 
response by suppressing the maturation of dendritic cells. 
MSCs may also restrain the T, B, and NK cell function in 
inflammation. MSCs are involved in cross talk between 
the immune cells and as a result may present a novel 
approach for the treatment of various diseases [13].
The stromal vascular fraction (SVF) can be obtained 
from fat tissue and contains a variety of different types 
of cells including adipose-derived stem cells. Adipose-
derived stem cells or ADSCs are multi-potential in that 
they have the ability to differentiate into a variety of 
different types of tissue including but not limited to bone, 
cartilage, muscle, ligament, tendon and fat [14]. These 
cells have also been shown to express a variety of differ-
ent growth factors and signaling molecules (cytokines), 
which recruit other stem cells to facilitate repair and 
healing of the affected tissue. ADSCs are very angiogenic 
in nature and can promote the growth of new blood ves-
sels. ADSCs might play a role in the local inflammatory 
process in the joint.
The SVF might play a role in the local inflammatory 
process in the joint. Studies have shown that SVF exerts 
anti-inflammatory effects on both chondrocytes and 
synoviocytes and that the cells are not dependent on 
adipose tissue sources or donors. SVF has been shown 
to exhibit immunosuppressive properties and release 
anti-inflammatory molecules like IL-10, IL-1, recep-
tor antagonist (IL-1ra), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, 
transforming growth factor (TGF) β and prostaglan-
din E2. The cells in SVF seem to be able to sense and 
respond to the local environment in OA knees [15, 16]. 
A stromal vascular fraction can easily be isolated from 
fat tissue in approximately 30–90 min in a clinic setting 
using a mini-lipoaspirate technique. The SVF contains 
a mixture of cells including ADSCs and growth fac-
tors and has been depleted of the adipocyte (fat cell) 
population. It has been shown that cells isolated from 
the SVF contain an abundance of CD34+ cells [15, 17]. 
SVF can be used in a point of care setting for a variety 
of indications and is currently being used in thousands 
of clinics world-wide with varying degrees of success 
being reported. Adipose tissue is quickly becoming the 
preferred source for point of care treatments in clinic 
due to the high number of MSCs that can be obtained 
and the low number of leukocytes as compared to bone 
marrow. In addition, adipose tissue has a significantly 
higher amount of pericytes which are the precursors to 
MSCs [18–20].
Recent studies evaluating ADSCs as a potential for 
articular cartilage regeneration have shown the poten-
tial of the cells to develop into chondrogenic lineage [21]. 
Clinical studies have reported improvements in function 
and pain of the knee joint as well as increased cartilage 
thickness with a strong safety profile [22–27].
Adipose tissue has many advantages in comparison to 
bone marrow. Adipose can be easily obtained by standard 
liposuction under local anesthesia. Adipose tissue con-
tains approximately 500–2500 times more mesenchymal 
stem cells compared to the same volume of bone mar-
row [20]. In addition, the number of stem cells available 
in the bone marrow decreases with age and the pool in 
adipose tissue is quite stable during life. Compared with 
bone marrow-derived cells, adipose tissue-derived cells 
are more genetically stable, have higher proliferative and

differentiation capacity, have lower senescence ratio, and 
have longer telomere length [28, 29].
In one clinical study reporting on 18 patients (between 
the ages of 18 and 75), SVF from subcutaneous abdomi-
nal fat was injected intra-articularly into idiopathic oste-
oarthritic knees. The high dose injections (1.0 × 108) 
were associated with an improvement in pain, stiffness 
and function as measured by the WOMAC score with 
a mean reduction of 39% over a 6 month period. MRI 
examination found regeneration of articular cartilage in 
the medial femoral and tibial condyles as well as in the 
lateral femoral and tibial condyles and increased carti-
lage volume in the medial femoral and tibial condyles at 
6 months. Arthroscopy before and 6 months after SVF 
injection demonstrated findings consistent with clinical 
and radiological outcomes showing the regeneration of 
articular cartilage with a thick, glossy white matrix and 
smooth surface well integrated with the sub chondral 
bone [24].
Another clinical study reported on 18 patients (6 men 
and 12 women) injected with SVF from the infrapatellar 
fat pad with a mean of 1.8 million cells (range 0.3 × 106–
2.7 × 106) along with approximately 3.0 ml of platelet 
rich plasma with a mean of 1.28 × 106 platelets/ml. OA 
index scores decreased significantly (p < 0.001) from 49.9 
points preoperatively to 30.3 points at the final follow up 
(range 24–26 months). Lysholm score improved signifi-
cantly from a mean preoperative value of 40.1 points to 
73.4 points, and similarly VAS scores decreased from 4.8 
preoperatively to 2.0 at last follow up. In addition, nota-
ble changes were detected in cartilage MRI scores which 
improved from 28.3 points to 21.7 points. This study sug-
gested that intra-articular injection of SVF from infrapa-
tellar fat pad is effective for reducing pain and promoting 
new tissue growth [22]. The same group had reported on 
an earlier study with similar results [30].
In one large trial (n = 1128), SVF was utilized in 
patients with grade 2–4 degenerative osteoarthritis 
(OA). The trial demonstrated a strong safety profile with 
no severe adverse events or systemic infection. In addi-
tion, no patients developed cancer as a result of SVF 
therapy. A majority of the patients demonstrated gradual 
improvement 3–12 months after the treatment. At least 
75% score improvement was noticed in 63% of patients 
and at least 50% Score improvement was documented in 
91% of patients after 12 months. The authors concluded 
that SVF therapy is a novel and promising treatment 
approach for patients with OA [26].
Adult stem cells require various growth factors to 
maintain their growth and engraftment. Recent stud-
ies have discussed the use of platelet rich plasma (PRP) 
as a rich source of growth factors. Platelets contain key 
growth factors such as platelet derived growth factor 
(PDGF), transforming growth factor (TGF), fibroblast 
growth factor (FGF), and various interleukins (IL) which 
may contribute to the functionality of the stem cells [31]. 
Platelet released growth factors regulate endogenous 
hyaluronic acid (HA) synthesis, thereby protecting the 
cartilage and lubricating the join [11]. It also enhances 
the secretion of HA and induces hepatocyte growth 
factor production by synovial fibroblasts isolated from 
arthritic patients. This study considers the intra-articular 
injection of SVF from fat and the safety and efficacy for 
the treatment of OA in combination with PRP.
Methods
The criteria for selection were patients age 50 or older 
who present with symptomatic primary osteoarthritis 
of the knee [1], defined by daily pain for the previous 
3 months, analgesics usage at least once a week, less than 
30 min of morning stiffness and a WOMAC score of ≤75 
in the target knee. The radiographic eligibility criteria 
included Brandt Radiographic Grading Scale of Osteoar-
thritis grade 1 and 2. The exclusion criteria were evidence 
of secondary knee osteoarthritis, severe osteoarthritis 
(joint space width—JSW <2 mm), prior intra articular 
injections within the previous 1 year prior to inclusion 
and patients with clinically significant systemic disease.
The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Oste-
oarthritis Index (WOMAC) is a widely used measure of 
patient’s subjective assessment of pain, joint mobility and 
physical disability. It evaluates three dimensions, namely 
pain, stiffness and physical function with 5, 2, and 17 
questions respectively. Total maximum score is 96 and 
minimum is 0. Each subscale is summated to a maximum 
score of 20, 8 and 68 respectively [32].
The six-minute walking distance (6MWD) was carried 
out by marking off a 50 m distance in an interior hall-
way and asking subjects to walk as far as they can and 
as quickly as they can over 6 min. The total distance was 
measured and recorded [33].
Antero-posterior radiographs of the knee joints were 
obtained with patients in a weight bearing position, joint 
fully extended, standing at 1 m from the X-Ray source, 
using previously published guidelines. Width was meas-
ured at the narrowest point of the joint space width 
(minimal JSW). This progression was defined by a JSW 
loss of more than 0.50 mm during the study, as previously 
reported [34].
MRI was completed with 1.5 T standard protocols of 
each individual joint in coronal sagittal and transverse 
plane. Maximum thickness of cartilage at posterior/
meniscal and patellar level measured at mid sagittal thru 
medial condyle was taken into account. The medial femo-
ral cartilage of the affected knee was selected for meas-
urement. Three regions of the medial femoral condyle

were identified at the anterior patella femoral, meniscal 
and posterior condyle level. The point having maximum 
thickness in the sagittal section passing thru the middle 
was identified for measurement.
Etoricoxib with a dose limited 90 mg BD after meals 
was advised to patients for unbearable pain. If the pain 
was still uncomfortable then they were advised to take 
codeine in a dose of 30 mg as needed and report the next 
day.
Tolerability and safety assessments included any 
symptoms and signs reported by the patient and also 
laboratory based hematological and biochemical assays. 
Synovial fluid was analyzed using microscopic examina-
tion at baseline and 2 years post procedure for atypical 
cell counts. Adverse events were categorized as isolated, 
intermittent or continuous depending on interference 
with the subject’s daily activities as mild, moderate or 
severe. Possible causal relationship with the supplement 
in terms of Definite/Possible/Probable/Non Assessable/
None were assigned. The study was approved by institu-
tional committee for stem cell research and therapy. All 
the patients were well informed and gave written consent 
to participate in the study.
Isolation of stromal vascular fraction cells from adipose 
tissue
From each patient, approximately 100 ml fat was col-
lected from the abdomen using a 3 mm aspiration can-
nula with prior administration of tumescent solution and 
placed into sterile disposable 250 ml conical centrifuge 
tubes. The adipose tissue was washed twice in phosphate 
buffered saline (PBS) and digested using collagenase at 
37 °C for 30 min with agitation at 5-min intervals. The 
suspension was then divided into four 50 ml centrifuge 
tubes and centrifuged at 500×g for 5 min to collect the 
SVF as a pellet. The pellet was washed twice with nor-
mal saline to remove any residual enzyme, and resus-
pended in PBS. The SVF suspension was filtered through 
a 100 μm cell strainer and centrifuged at 500×g for 5 min. 
The supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resus-
pended in normal saline and filtered through a 40 µm cell 
strainer. Samples were taken to determine the cell quan-
tity, viability, and to culture and characterize the stem 
cells.
Culture of the cells
The cells were washed thoroughly with DPBS/Gentamy-
cin thoroughly twice. These were centrifuged at 1500 rpm 
for 10 min. Supernatant was discarded. The pellet was 
re-suspended in complete DMEM medium (Sigma) and 
plated in a T25 flask and incubated at 37 °C under 5% 
 
CO2. Media was changed every 3–4 days until the cells 
achieved 90% confluency. The cells were characterized 
through morphological evaluation and flow cytometry 
analysis.
Morphological studies
The cells were cultured in six well plates up to 70% con-
fluency in complete DMEM media and pictures were 
taken at different time intervals by an inverted micro-
scope at 20× magnification.
Flow cytometry studies
For flow cytometry, the cells were cultured in six well 
plates in complete DMEM media to 80% confluency. 
These were harvested using mild trypsin EDTA and 
washed with PBS. The cells were incubated with fluo-
rescently labeled antibodies CD90, CD34, CD73, CD45, 
CD105 and HLA-DR. The cells were processed for flow 
cytometry analysis using BD FACS Calibur.
Platelet rich plasma preparation
Platelet rich plasma was derived from the peripheral 
blood of the same donor as the adipose tissue. Briefly, 
20 ml of peripheral blood was collected into BD yellow 
top vacuum tubes (ACD Solution A) and centrifuged at 
800×g for 10 min. The plasma fraction was collected and 
centrifuged at 1000×g for 5 min to obtain a platelet pel-
let. Most of the plasma was then removed, leaving 3 ml 
plasma to resuspend the platelets.
Statistical analysis
Formal power calculations were not performed. Two 
tailed statistical analyses were performed and confidence 
intervals are presented with 95% degree of confidence. 
All statistical tests used a significance level of α ≤0.05.
Treatments
A total of ten patients over the age of 50 with idiopathic 
osteoarthritis of the knee were enrolled in the study. 
SVF cells were resuspended in 5 ml of saline and com-
bined with 3 ml of PRP. A single injection of SVF and 
PRP was administered intra-articularly. At the baseline, 
patients were assessed for vital signs, laboratory tests, 
WOMAC score, 6MWD, radiological images of joint 
space width, and MRI measurement of articular cartilage 
thickness. Clinical status of all patients was closely moni-
tored at baseline, at the time of SVF treatment, 1 week, 
1, 3, 6 months, and 1, 1.5 and 2 years after the SVF treat-
ment. WOMAC score, 6 MWD and laboratory tests were 
repeated at 3 and 6 months and 1, 1.5 and 2 years. XRAY 
and MRI were completed at 1 year. Clinical evaluation 
included medical history, physical examination, assess-
ment of joint pain, number of analgesic drugs taken, joint 
stiffness and extent of joint movement, as well as any side 
effects possibly associated with SVF cell therapy.

Results
A total of ten patients were treated with mean age of 58.4, 
height of 158.2 cm and weight of 72.6 kg. Six patients 
were male and four were female. Seven patients had one 
knee treated and three had both knees injected. Fat har-
vested yielded an average nucleated SVF mean cell con-
centration of 1 × 106/ml of adipose tissue and viability 
of 87.4%. The morphology of the cultured cells appeared 
to be like typical fibroblastic mesenchymal stem cells 
adhered to the plastic surface (Fig. 1a). Few clumps of 
the cells were observed. The flow Cytometry data show 
more than 98% positive expression of CD105, CD90 and 
CD73 and negative expression of CD45, CD34 and HLA 
DR (Fig. 1b).
Significant changes in the WOMAC scores were noted 
in both the subsets and the total after 2 years as com-
pared to the baseline. A correlation between pain sever-
ity and disability was demonstrated by the WOMAC 
subscales. The WOMAC scale allows a detailed analysis 
of pain because patients score the pain severity while 
performing specific activities. Patients had a decreased 
functional ability most likely due to severe pain at base-
line readings. The average total WOMAC score (Fig. 2a) 
was 64 at the baseline and significantly reduced to 52 
at 3 months (p < 0.01), 46 at 6 months (p < 0.01), 42 at 
1 year (p < 0.01), 38 at 1.5 years (p < 0.01), and 41 at 
2 years (p < 0.01).
WOMAC pain score during walking, using stairs, in 
bed, sitting or lying and standing were also recorded. 
Patients demonstrated a significant reduction in pain 
(Fig. 2b) from 14 at baseline to 12 at 3 months (p < 0.01), 
11 at 6 months (p < 0.01), 9 at 1 year (p < 0.01), 8 
at 1.5 years (p < 0.01), and 9 at 2 years (p < 0.01) post 
therapy. Stiffness score (Fig. 2c) which includes 17 
parameters, showed reduction from 6 at baseline to 5 
at 3 months and 6 months (p < 0.01), and 4 at 1, 1.5 and 
2 years (p < 0.01). Physical function score (Fig. 2d) of 50 
from the baseline reduced to 44 at 3 months (p < 0.01), 
38 at 6 months (p < 0.01), 32 at 1 year (p < 0.01), 30 at 
1.5 years (p < 0.01) and 31 at 2 years (p < 0.01).
Figure 3 shows the results of the 6MWD. Patients 
walked an average of 1310 feet at baseline and demon-
strated a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.01) 
at 3 and 6 months and 1, 1.5, and 2 years post treatment. 
In addition, the requirement of pain medication post 
injection reduced from twice a week at baseline to once 
a week in 3 patients at 3 months, 5 patients at 6 months, 
7 patients at 1 year, 8 patients at 1.5 years and 5 patients 
at 2 years.
MRI evaluation demonstrated that cartilage thickness 
improved by at least 0.2 mm in six patients. Thickness 
remained unchanged in two patients at 1 year, which 
indicated chondro-protective and anti-inflammatory 
disease stabilization effect. However, in two patients 
it decreased by 0.2 mm. At 2 years post injection, one 
patient received a follow up MRI which showed that 
the increased cartilage volume was maintained (Fig. 4). 
Figures 5, 6, 7, 8 show MRIs at baseline and 1 year post 
treatment.
Overall, all of patients were pleased with the treatment 
results. They reported that their pain levels gradually 
reduced, especially after 3 months. More importantly, 
the procedure demonstrated a strong safety profile with 
no severe adverse events or complications reported. One 
patient complained of pain and swelling due to reactive 
synovitis which responded with complete resolution with 
conservative treatment.
Safety evaluation
Two years post procedure, synovial fluid examination 
showed no atypical cells (Table 1). However, the analysis 
suggested that treatment helped to restore synovial fluid 
properties, restore synovial metabolism and reduce carti-
lage pathology. Eight patients demonstrated a reduction 
in atypical cells. Average cell counts were 1226 cells/μl at 
baseline and reduced to 845 cells/μl at 2 years. The hema-
tological and biochemical parameters recorded before 
and after 2 years of the treatment also did not show any 
abnormalities (Table 2).
Discussion
Osteoarthritis is a chronic progressive degenerative dis-
ease associated with cartilage loss and degeneration. Cur-
rent treatments are limited and advanced disease relies 
on total joint replacement. Total joint replacement may 
be associated with serious and life threatening compli-
cations including increased risk of infection, thrombo-
embolism, myocardial infarction, stroke, and even death 
post-surgery. In addition, the life span of the prosthesis is 
limited [34].
This preliminary clinical study showed that SVF cells 
freshly isolated from adipose tissue, combined with PRP 
and administered intra-articularly, demonstrate heal-
ing potential in patients with degenerative OA. This is 
consistent with previously published results from both 
preclinical and clinical studies. Patients demonstrated 
significant improvements in their degenerative OA 
leading to a better quality of life. These improvements 
included a clinically significant reduction in pain.
Pain functional status of the knee was improved 
12 months post injection in all patients and this 
improvement was maintained at the 2 year time point. 
Some patients showed improvements as early as 3 and 
6 months after the injection of SVF and PRP. This con-
firms the mechanism of action of regenerative medicine 
to be a cascade of events that occur over time. These

events include an immuno-modulatory effect that can 
lead to tissue remodeling. The anti-inflammatory and 
pain reduction effects may be attributed to the soluble 
growth factors secreted from the SVF or ADSCs [32]. 
Growth factors from ADSCs may be continuously pro-
duced after injection of these cells into the joint creating 
a cascade of events that lead to healing. It is unclear at 
this point whether the cells injected actually differentiate 
into new cartilage or the cells injected stimulate native 
tissue to heal by creating a paracrine effect. Native cells 
may be called to the area to help remodel the damaged 
tissue leading to an increase in cartilage volume [11].
The autologous SVF and PRP injections also signifi-
cantly reduced the requirement of pain medication in 8 
out of 10 patients. These medications are often associated 
with undesired side effects and although it may mask the 
pain, it does not help the underlying disease. In addition, 
clinical improvement corresponded well with improve-
ment on MRI imaging. We were able to demonstrate 
safety with no serious side effects reported during the 
2 year follow-up. One patient experienced local pain and 
swelling at the lipo-aspiration site, but those symptoms 
were short lasting and were well controlled with common 
analgesics. Only one patient developed synovitis in the 
joint which resolved with conservative treatment.
Freshly isolated cells may represent a safe and effica-
cious way to manage patients with osteoarthritis. An 
immediate autologous transplantation can prevent com-
plications related to the reduced quality of the trans-
planted cells such as pre-aging (telomere shortening), 
reduced viability, or dedifferentiation/reprogramming 
that is associated with in vitro-cultivation [35]. In addi-
tion, the risk for infection is reduced by decreasing the 
ex vivo time period. Although in this study cells isolated 
from SVF were also evaluated by culture and charac-
terization to further establish existence of MSCs in the 
fraction, cells isolated from SVF expressed character-
istics distinctive for MSC identification such as plastic

adherence with typical fibroblast like morphology and 
positive MSC markers by flow cytometry. Overall the 
entire treatment is a relatively simple procedure which 
is inexpensive and can be completed in clinic on an out-
patient basis. Numerous studies are currently in pro-
gress to clarify some of the questions that still remain 
unanswered regarding the long-term durability of these 
procedures and possible modifications to achieve bet-
ter results. Here we present preliminary data suggesting 
safety and long term efficacy of a cost effective outpatient 
procedure of administration of SVF and PRP in the knee.
This study lacks a placebo control due to very small 
sample size. The relationship of age, sex, weight and 
the severity of OA could not be clearly ascertained. 
In addition, MRI evaluation should have been more 
extensive with three-dimensional magnetic resonance 
observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) or 
other scaling methods to quantify the regeneration in

cartilage following the treatment. Further it is not clear 
if the regenerated cartilage is fibro cartilage or hyaline as 
arthroscopic biopsy was not possible in any of subjects. 
The extensive pathologic changes in OA were identified 
as “joint failure” not only in articular cartilage but also in 
the changes of synovial membrane. Changes in subchon-
dral bone and joint capsules were not investigated.
Conclusions
SVF combined with PRP has a great potential as a thera-
peutic agent in regenerative medicine especially in ortho-
pedic conditions. The high numbers of MSCs in SVF 
make it a suitable source for cellular medicine. Prelimi-
nary studies suggest that it is a safe and effective method 
for treating osteoarthritis. Both qualitative and quan-
titative measurements showed statistically significant 
improvements during the follow up period of 2 years. 
Additional studies with larger patient numbers and con-
trol subjects are needed to confirm the above results. 
Another limitation of this study is the combined effects 
of two modalities is unclear. Future studies with rand-
omized groups considering each therapeutic agent sepa-
rately and combined against a control are warranted. This 
clinical study of a combined intra-articular injection of 
SVF and PRP into the knee suggests a promising mini-
mally invasive therapy for OA patients.
