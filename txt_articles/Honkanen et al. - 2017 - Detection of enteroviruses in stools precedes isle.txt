Abstract
Aims/hypothesis This case–control study was nested in a pro-
spective birth cohort to evaluate whether the presence of en-
teroviruses in stools was associated with the appearance of
islet autoimmunity in the Type 1 Diabetes Prediction and
Prevention study in Finland.
Methods Altogether, 1673 longitudinal stool samples from
129 case children who turned positive for multiple islet
autoantibodies and 3108 stool samples from 282 matched
control children were screened for the presence of entero-
virus RNA using RT-PCR. Viral genotype was detected by
sequencing.
Results Case children had more enterovirus infections than
control children (0.8 vs 0.6 infections per child). Time-
dependent analysis indicated that this excess of infections oc-
curred more than 1 year before the first detection of islet auto-
antibodies (6.3 vs 2.1 infections per 10 follow-up years). No
such difference was seen in infections occurring less than 1 year
before islet autoantibody seroconversion or after seroconver-
sion. The most frequent enterovirus types included
coxsackievirus A4 (28% of genotyped viruses), coxsackievirus
A2 (14%) and coxsackievirus A16 (11%).
Conclusions/interpretation The results suggest that enterovi-
rus infections diagnosed by detecting viral RNA in stools are

Introduction
Type 1 diabetes is caused by an immune-mediated process
that damages insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreatic
islets. The subclinical phase of the disease can be identified
by detecting autoantibodies against islet antigens, including
islet cell antibodies (ICAs), insulin antibodies (IAAs),
insulinoma-associated protein 2 antibodies (IA-2As), zinc
transporter 8 antibodies and GAD antibodies [1].
Enteroviruses have been linked to type 1 diabetes in studies
showing an increased frequency of these viruses in the blood
and pancreas of diabetic and autoantibody-positive individuals
[2–4] and in serological studies showing an increased frequen-
cy of enterovirus antibodies in diabetic and autoantibody-
positive participants [5–11]. However, this association has
not been seen in all studies [8].
Relatively few prospective studies have been carried out
even though such studies would be optimal for evaluating
the possible role of enterovirus infections in the most impor-
tant phase of pathogenesis, the initiation of islet autoimmuni-
ty. The results from such studies have suggested that entero-
virus infections, diagnosed by serology or by direct detection
of the virus from blood, are associated with the appearance of
islet autoantibodies long before clinical diabetes is diagnosed
[6, 9, 11, 12]. In contrast, the detection of the virus in stools
has not shown such an association [13, 14], and in one study in
which both blood and rectal swabs were analysed, no associ-
ation at all was found [15]. However, these negative findings
have been based on small cohorts and infrequent sample col-
lection. In addition, the Diabetes and Autoimmunity Study in
the Young (DAISY) study in the USA has evaluated the pos-
sible role of enterovirus infection in the progression of islet
autoimmunity to clinical disease and reported more enterovi-
rus infections detected by the presence of virus in blood but
not in stools in children who progressed to diabetes [16].
The current study is the largest study to date in which
enteroviruses have been analysed in longitudinal stool
samples collected from children who developed signs of a beta
cell-damaging process during their prospective observation.
Since this study was based on a prospective birth cohort, we
were able to analyse time-dependent associations between en-
terovirus infections and the initiation of the beta cell-
damaging process.
Methods
Subjects Serial stool samples were collected longitudinally
from children taking part in the Type 1 Diabetes Prediction
and Prevention (DIPP) study running in three cities in Finland
(Oulu, Tampere and Turku). In this study, children with HLA
class II genotypes conferring increased susceptibility to type 1
diabetes (about 12% of all newborns) are invited to a prospec-
tive follow-up starting from birth [17]. All children in the
DIPP are regularly screened during the follow-up for the pos-
sible presence of diabetes-associated ICAs in serum and, if
found to be positive for these, are also tested for biochemically
defined autoantibodies including IAA, IA-2A and GAD anti-
bodies. Since the beginning of 2003, all children have been
regularly screened for both the biochemically defined autoan-
tibodies and ICAs. ICAs were detected by indirect immuno-
fluorescence, and the three other autoantibodies were quanti-
fied with radiolabel-binding assays as previously described
[18]. Longitudinal stool samples were collected for viral
analyses once a month starting from the age of 3 months
and lasting until the age of 2–3 years [19]. The study proto-
col has been approved by the ethics committees of the
University Hospitals in Oulu, Tampere and Turku, and par-
ents gave their written informed consent to their child’s par-
ticipation in the study.
The present study followed a nested case–control design.
The case children included 129 children who turned positive
for at least two islet autoantibodies and remained
autoantibody-positive in all later samples. Seventy-nine case
children were positive for one, 30 for two and 9 for three
biochemical autoantibodies in the first autoantibody-positive
sample. Ninety-seven (75%) of the children had developed
type 1 diabetes by the end of 2015. The mean age at autoan-
tibody seroconversion was 23 months (range 6–73 months),
and diabetes was diagnosed at a mean age of 5 years 10 months
(range 10–162 months). The case children were born between
1996 and 2009, and 64% were boys. From one to five control
children were selected for each case child (giving 282 control
children altogether), and were matched for area of residence,
sex, HLA-DQ genotype and time of birth (+/− 2 months). All
control children remained negative for autoantibodies and
were non-diabetic at the time when islet autoantibodies ap-
peared in the corresponding case child.
The original HLA screening result was later supplemented
by accurate HLA-DR/DQ genotyping [20]. According to
Diabetologia (2017) 60:424–431
425
 Ilonen et al [20], different haplotypes have either strong sus-
ceptibility, weak susceptibility, neutral susceptibility, weak
protection or strong protection properties. Six different geno-
type risk groups were created based on the properties of indi-
vidual haplotypes: high risk, moderately increased risk, slight-
ly increased risk, neutral, slightly decreased risk and strongly
decreased risk. In the current study, 50% of case children and
40% of control children carried the high-risk genotype, 35%
of case and 27% of control children carried the moderately
increased risk genotype, and 15% of case and 21% of control
children carried the slightly increased risk genotype. The ac-
curate genotyping was not successful in 5% of control chil-
dren, and 7% of control children had a neutral or slightly
decreased risk [20].
Detection of enterovirus RNA in stool samples Altogether,
4781 stool samples (1673 samples from 129 case children and
3108 samples from 282 control children) were available for
virus analysis (mean 11 samples per child, range 1–34; see
electronic supplementary material [ESM] Figs 1 and 2). The
mean number of samples did not differ between cases and
controls (12 vs 11 samples per child).
All stool samples were screened for the presence of entero-
virus RNA using RT-PCR. Analyses were carried out blinded
without knowing the case–control status of the child, but the
samples from the case child and his or her controls were
analysed in the same test run. Both virus-negative and virus-
positive control samples were included in every test run.
RT-PCR was carried out using two methods. In both
methods, a 10% (weight/vol) stool suspension was first pre-
pared from the original stool sample in Hanks’ solution in-
cluding gentamicin, penicillin G, amphotericin B and 4%
BSA. Total nucleic acids were extracted from this suspension
for 4099 of the samples using a MagNa Pure extraction robot
(Roche, Applied Science, Germany) and Total Nucleid Acid
extraction kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s proto-
col, and the extracted RNA was then reverse-transcribed, am-
plified and subjected to detection using a previously described
PCR method [21]. The remaining 682 samples were extracted
using Qiagen RNeasy 96 kit (Qiagen, Germany) and analysed
using real-time RT-PCR using the QuantiTect Probe PCR Kit
(Qiagen) as previously described [22]. The real-time PCR was
performed according to the instructions on the QuantiTect
Probe kit using TaqMan chemistry.
In pilot studies, the two methods were compared using
stool samples spiked with different amounts of enterovirus-
infected cells and were found to have comparable sensitivity
(data not shown). In addition, the same method was always
used to analyse stool samples from a particular case child and
from his or her controls, thus excluding biases in case–control
comparison in a scenario where the methods could have had
minor differences in their sensitivity.
Sequencing All samples that were positive for enterovirus
RNA in RT-PCR analyses were genotyped by sequencing
the viral protein 1 (VP1) region of the viral genome [23].
The obtained sequences were blasted against the National
Center for Biotechnology Information non-redundant nucleo-
tide database. If the child had the same genotype in consecu-
tive samples, these samples were interpreted as one infection
by the given genotype.
Statistical analyses The frequency of enterovirus infections
during the follow-up was adjusted to the duration of the
follow-up time by assuming that each stool sample covered
enterovirus infections during the preceding month (a 1 month
period of viral shedding into the stools). Thus, each stool
sample represented a 1 month follow-up time. The number
of infections per 10 follow-up years was used to present the
data.
In time-dependent analyses, the time of sample draws for
each child was adjusted to the time of birth or the time when
islet autoantibodies first appeared. Additional analyses were
carried out for a cohort that was harmonised for the time of
sample collection by including only those samples which were
taken during the same calendar month from the case child and
his or her matched controls, and by including only such case–
control pairs whose complete HLA-DR/DQ genotypes were
defined. In addition, the number of infections per child was
adjusted for the number of samples available from the child.
Conditional logistic regression analysis was used in the
comparisons of the matched case–control groups using Stata
13.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) and R 3.2.2
(www.r-project.org) to compute ORs with their 95% CIs. A
p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The
OR in the current study describes how much one positive
follow-up month increased the risk of a child turning
autoantibody-positive during the follow-up.
Ethics The study was approved by the ethics committees of
the participating university hospitals, and the parents gave
their written informed consent to the participation in the study.
Results
Enterovirus RNA was detected in 370 (7.7%) of all the 4781
stool samples. A clear seasonal pattern was seen as the sam-
ples collected during March to July showed the lowest fre-
quency of enterovirus positivity (Fig. 1). The rate of enterovi-
rus infection was similar in children younger than 6 months of
age and in those aged 6–18 months or 18–24 months (5.2, 5.2
and 5.9 infections per 10 follow-up years, respectively) but
declined to 2.0 infections per 10 follow-up years in older
children (Fig. 2). The proportion of enterovirus-positive sam-
ples did not differ between boys and girls (8.9% vs 7.0%) or
426
Diabetologia (2017) 60:424–431
 between different HLA-DR/DQ groups (high-risk genotype
group 7.4%, moderately increased risk genotype group
8.7%, and slightly increased genotype group 7.4%).
Altogether, 108 infections were diagnosed in the 129 case
children and 169 infections in the 282 control children during
the whole follow-up (mean 0.8 vs. 0.6 infections per child).
This difference was also seen in infections that occurred prior
to the appearance of autoantibodies (0.6 vs 0.4 infections per
child). This difference was most obvious in the youngest and
oldest age groups (Fig. 2 and ESM Fig. 2). These results were
also similar when only the 109 case children who developed
islet autoantibodies early, before the age of 3 years, and their
250 controls were included in these analyses (0.6 vs 0.5 in-
fections per child). The first enterovirus-positive samples were
detected, on average, at the age of 11 months among both
cases (range 3–26 months) and controls (range 3–25 months).
Time-dependent analyses showed that the excess of infec-
tions in case children occurred more than 12 months before
the first autoantibody-positive sample was taken. During this
time period, an average of 0.62 infections were diagnosed per
case child compared with 0.33 infections per control child,
corresponding to 6.3 vs 2.1 infections per 10 follow-up years,
respectively (233 children; OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.00, 1.06,
p =0.023). Altogether, 33.8% (26/77) of the case children
and 21.2% (33/156) of the control children had at least one
infection during that period (OR = 2.3, 95% CI 1.1, 5.0,
p=0.033). The same difference was seen among case children
who turned autoantibody-positive before the age of 3 years:
0.5 vs 0.2 infections per child, corresponding to 5.7 vs 1.5
infections per 10 follow-up years (182 children; OR 1.03,
95% CI 1.00, 1.07, p=0.035; Fig. 3). At least one infection
was diagnosed in 30.4% (17/56) of these cases compared with
15.1% (19/126) of their controls (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.2, 7.6,
p=0.022). The excess of infections was also seen when only
those samples that were collected during exactly the same
calendar month from both the case child and his or her
matched control child/children were included in these analy-
ses (233 children; OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.00, 1.06, p=0.042), as
well as when the number of infections per child was adjusted
for the number of samples available from the child (OR 2.0,
95% CI 1.0, 4.0, p=0.043). In addition, the difference was
seen when only those case–control pairs were included whose
completed HLA-DR/DQ genotypes matched (176 children;
OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01, 1.10, p=0.01) and when only those
cases who developed type 1 diabetes and their controls were
included (172 children; OR 1.04, CI 1.00, 1.08, p=0.029). In
contrast to these early infections, the infections that occurred

 after autoantibody seroconversion, were not associated with
islet autoimmunity (Fig. 3). The results were similar in both
sexes (data not shown). The proportion of strongly
enterovirus-positive samples did not differ between case and
control children (data not shown).
The sequence analysis of the VP1 region of the viral ge-
nome was successful for 244 of all 370 enterovirus-positive
samples (90 case samples and 154 control samples, success
rate 66%; 73% in strong positives and 27% in weak positives).
Sequence analysis identified 277 individual infections and
provided the exact viral genotype in 174 (63%) of them (63
infections in case children and 111 infections in control chil-
dren). Twenty-five per cent of the cases and 27% of the con-
trols had two consecutive samples positive for the same virus
strain, and 8% of the cases and 5% of the controls had three or
more consecutive samples positive for the same virus strain,
reflecting the long excretion period of the virus (p=0.078 for
three or more samples).
Altogether, 25 different enterovirus types were detected
and species A enteroviruses were the predominating types
(Table 1). None of the individual enterovirus types showed
statistically significant association with islet autoimmunity.
This was true when all detected infections were analysed as
well as when only infections preceding the first detection of
autoantibodies were analysed. Some enterovirus types were
only observed in case children (coxsackieviruses A14 and
B2, echovirus 13) and some only in control children
(coxsackievirus B4, echoviruses 4, 7, 9, 25 and 30, and en-
teroviruses 68 and 90), but these occurred rarely (Table 1).
Discussion
This is the largest study carried out so far in which the occur-
rence of enteroviruses has been studied in longitudinal stool
samples collected from children who developed signs of a beta
cell-damaging process, and has been compared with results
from carefully matched control children. Overall, in the cur-
rent study, enterovirus infections were detected more frequent-
ly in case than in control children. The excess of infections
preceded the appearance of autoantibodies, paralleling the
findings from our previous prospective studies in the DIPP
study, the Trial to Reduce IDDM in the Genetically at Risk
(TRIGR) pilot and the Childhood Diabetes in Finland (DiMe)
cohorts, in which enterovirus infections were documented by
antibody assays and detection of viral RNA from serum [6, 9,
11, 24–26]. In addition, the Norwegian Environmental
Triggers of Type 1 Diabetes (MIDIA) study also observed a
peak in enterovirus RNA in blood at the time of autoantibody
seroconversion [12]. Altogether, these findings suggest that
enterovirus infections might play a role in the initiation of
the beta cell-damaging process.
Only two previously published studies have evaluated the
association between enteroviruses and type 1 diabetes in pro-
spective birth cohorts by detecting enteroviruses in longitudi-
nal stool sample series [13, 14]. Neither of those studies found
any difference in enterovirus infections between children who
developed islet autoimmunity or type 1 diabetes and matched
control children. One of these studies included 22 case and 82
control children [13], and the other included 27 case and 53
control children [14]. One additional cohort study detected
enteroviruses from both blood samples and rectal swabs,
showing no difference between 26 case and 39 control chil-
dren [15], but later reported that enterovirus infections might
be associated with the progression of islet autoimmunity to
diabetes [16]. Altogether, these studies were based on a

 considerably smaller number of children than in our study,
which included 129 case and 282 control children. In addition,
one of these studies analysed stool samples only until the age
of 1 year [13] and another study collected samples with long
time intervals at the age of 9, 15 and 24 months, and annually
thereafter [15]. These aspects limited their power to detect a
time-dependent association between enterovirus infections
and islet autoimmunity.
The circulation of enteroviruses differs between popula-
tions and in different time periods, which may influence their
association with type 1 diabetes in different studies. For ex-
ample, we have proposed that the relatively low incidence of
enterovirus infections in Finland may make Finnish children
more susceptible to the possible diabetogenic effect of entero-
viruses [27]. The lower frequency of ‘background’ enterovirus
infections may also make it easier to detect the association
between enterovirus infection and type 1 diabetes in Finland.
The slightly lower frequency of enterovirus-positive samples
in the current study (7.7%) compared with the German and
Norwegian cohort studies (9–13%) [13, 14] is also in line with
a lower frequency of enterovirus infections in Finland. The
observed seasonal pattern of enterovirus positivity fits with
the known enterovirus seasonality observed in countries with
a temperate climate.
The excess of enterovirus infections occurred more than
12 months before islet autoantibody seroconversion. As the
average time interval from last autoantibody-negative serum
sample to the first autoantibody-positive serum sample was
6 months (range 2–20 months), it can be concluded that the
actual time lag is about 9 months or more. Taking into account
the fact that the mean age at the first autoantibody-positive
sample was 23 months, it is evident that most of these infec-
tions have occurred at a very young age, when children are
more susceptible to enterovirus infections. It is known that
enteroviruses can spread to the pancreatic islets in such young
infants [3, 28]. However, since stool samples were collected
only until the age of 3 years, further studies would be needed
to determine whether the presence of enteroviruses in stools is
associated with islet autoimmunity in older age groups.
The time lag from excessive infections to islet autoantibody
seroconversion was longer than in our previous study, which
was based on the detection of enterovirus RNA in serum [9].
The reason for this difference is not known, but it may be due
to the fact that these two cohorts of children were different,
sharing only eight case children. It is also possible that the
detection of viral RNA in serum reflects later stages of the
infection, for example viral replication in internal organs such
as pancreas. On the other hand, it is not known how closely
the time of autoantibody seroconversion reflects the time
when the beta cell-damaging process actually starts, and
how long a lag there is from the time of the triggering insults
to the appearance of autoantibodies. These aspects may also
vary considerably between individuals. Mouse models have
suggested that GAD65 autoantibodies appear within 8 weeks
after coxsackievirus B4 infection [29], while in humans the
time lag can be longer, particularly if viral persistency and/or
interactions with other risk factors contribute to the process. In
any case, the present study argues against a rapid lytic effect of
enteroviruses on beta cells, but rather suggests a possible in-
volvement of viral persistence and/or immune-mediated
mechanisms in enterovirus-induced diabetes in humans.
The enterovirus genotype was identified by sequence analysis
in 66% of all enterovirus-positive samples. Species A enterovi-
ruses predominated, and 70% of all successfully sequenced
samples contained a coxsackie A virus. The most frequent indi-
vidual coxsackievirus genotypes were A4 (in 28% of samples),
A2 (14%) and A16 (11%). Only a minority of the samples
contained a coxsackie B group virus (11%) or an echovirus
(10%). The high prevalence of species A enteroviruses is in line
with the results from another birth cohort study [30]. In addition,
our previous serological study in the DIPP cohort indicated a
high prevalence of neutralising antibodies against species A
enteroviruses [11], and the results of the current study are in
line with these observations. On the other hand, the genotype
distribution observed in the current study differs from that seen
in France and the Netherlands, where a majority of the entero-
virus infections have been found to be caused by species B
enteroviruses [31, 32]. However, these studies were carried
out among hospitalised patients and also included respiratory
samples [31, 32].
When the occurrence of different enterovirus genotypes was
compared between case and control groups, none of them
showed an association with beta cell autoimmunity. However,
even if this study is the largest study of this kind, it clearly lacks
statistical power to analyse this question for most of the entero-
virus types detected. This is emphasised by the fact that a rel-
atively large proportion of detected enteroviruses remained
untyped due to the low titre of the virus (42% in case children
and 34% in control children). For example, coxsackie B and
certain other species B viruses that have been linked to type 1
diabetes [2, 5, 11, 19, 33–40] were detected in only a few
samples. This may reflect the fact that coxsackie B infections
are mainly respiratory in nature and hence not detected in stools
as frequently as in respiratory samples. For example, type B1,
which is associated with an increased risk of islet autoimmunity
in serological studies [10, 11], has most commonly been de-
tected in respiratory samples in surveillance studies [41]. The
duration of virus excretion into stools may also differ between
different enterovirus types, and studies based on relatively long
sample intervals can miss a large proportion of infections with
short virus excretion periods. In any case, further studies
analysing a large cohort of children using both serological
and direct enterovirus detection methods and blood, stool and
respiratory samples are needed to get a complete picture of the
occurrence of different enterovirus types in case and control
children. This kind of systematic screening of enterovirus types

 would be crucially important for the development of vaccines
against these viruses.
One limitation of the present study is that it was carried out
in one country, and further studies are needed to find out
whether a similar association can be seen in other populations.
Another limitation is the lack of respiratory samples. Such
samples have not been collected in the DIPP study, but many
enterovirus types, such as EV68 and coxsackie B viruses,
often cause respiratory infections, and their detection in stools
may lead to a marked underestimation of their true frequency
[42, 43]. The case and control children were tightly matched
for the time of birth, age at sampling, sex and area of resi-
dence, which reduced the risk of the possible effect of con-
founding factors. In addition, they were matched for HLA-
conferred risk of type 1 diabetes because HLA genes can
influence anti-enterovirus immunity [44]. However, we can-
not exclude the possibility that some other non-HLA genes
could influence the detection of enteroviruses, even though we
consider this unlikely since previous studies have not found
any major effect of such genes on enterovirus positivity in
stools [45–47].
In conclusion, the present study suggests that enterovirus
infections in young children are associated with the appear-
ance of islet autoantibodies with a time lag of about 1 year.
This finding supports previous observations from other pro-
spective studies suggesting that enterovirus infections may
play a role in the initiation of the beta cell-damaging process.
