Purpose:
To investigate associations between neuroimaging markers 
of cerebrovascular disease, including lesion topography and 
extent and severity of strategic and global cerebral tissue 
injury, and cognition in carotid artery disease (CAD).
Materials and 
Methods:
All participants gave written informed consent to undergo 
brain magnetic resonance imaging and the Addenbrooke’s 
Cognitive Examination–Revised. One hundred eight pa-
tients with symptomatic CAD but no dementia were in-
cluded, and a score less than 82 represented cognitive im-
pairment. Group comparison and interrelations between 
global cognitive and fluency performance, lesion topogra-
phy, and ultrastructural damage were assessed with voxel-
based statistics. Associations between cognition, medial 
temporal lobe atrophy (MTA), lesion volumes, and global 
white matter ultrastructural damage indexed as increased 
mean diffusivity were tested with regression analysis by 
controlling for age. Diagnostic accuracy of imaging markers 
selected from a multivariate prediction model was tested 
with receiver operating characteristic analysis.
Results:
Cognitively impaired patients (n = 53 [49.1%], classified 
as having probable vascular cognitive disorder) were older 
than nonimpaired patients (P = .027) and had more frequent 
MTA (P , .001), more cortical infarctions (P = .016), and 
larger volumes of acute (P = .028) and chronic (P = .009) 
subcortical ischemic lesions. Lesion volumes did not corre-
late with global cognitive performance (lacunar infarctions, 
P = .060; acute lesions, P = .088; chronic subcortical ische-
mic lesions, P = .085). In contrast, cognitive performance 
correlated with presence of chronic ischemic lesions within 
the interhemispheric tracts and thalamic radiation (P , .05, 
false discovery rate corrected). Skeleton mean diffusivity 
showed the closest correlation with cognition (R2 = 0.311, P 
, .001) and promising diagnostic accuracy for vascular cog-
nitive disorder (area under the curve, 0.82 [95% confidence 
interval: 0.75, 0.90]). Findings were confirmed in subjects 
with a low risk of preclinical Alzheimer disease indexed by 
the absence of MTA (n = 85).
Conclusion:
Subcortical white matter ischemic lesion locations and sever-
ity of ultrastructural tract damage contribute to cognitive 
impairment in symptomatic CAD, which suggests that sub-
cortical disconnection within large-scale cognitive neural net-
works is a key mechanism of vascular cognitive disorder.

NEURORADIOLOGY: Cognitive Impairment in Symptomatic Carotid Artery Disease 
Meng et al
Patients with symptomatic carotid 
artery disease (CAD) have an increased 
risk of developing vascular cognitive dis-
order (12) as a result of several mech-
anisms, including direct risks of emboli 
and hypoperfusion via shared risk fac-
tors, brain tissue injury resulting from 
small-vessel disease, and arterial stiff-
ness (4), in addition to being prone to 
age-related neurodegeneration. Elderly 
patients with symptomatic CAD are 
thus a particularly interesting group in 
which to assess the value of neuroim-
aging markers because of their height-
ened risk for multiple mechanisms.
We aimed to investigate the role 
of vascular tissue damage for global 
cognition and fluency, as this domain 
is believed to be impaired early in vas-
cular cognitive disorder (13). We hy-
pothesized that strategic lesion location 
and tissue damage severity are better 
indexes of vascular cognitive disorder 
than is lesion volume. To explore the 
role of putative commixed pathologic 
of amyloid pathologic abnormalities by 
using positron emission tomographic 
(PET) imaging (5) or cerebrospinal fluid 
biomarkers (6) cannot be used in clin-
ical practice, as these techniques are 
prohibitively expensive and moderately 
invasive. There is a need for imaging 
biomarkers that can be used to predict 
and track vascular cognitive disorder. 
Moreover, neuroimaging markers may 
afford mechanistic insights into the key 
processes that underlie vascular cogni-
tive disorder.
Several imaging studies yielded only 
a modest association between visible 
ischemic lesion burden and cognitive 
impairment, which is thought to be an 
underestimation of the effect of ische-
mia on cognition, as measurement of 
lesion burden fails to take ultrastruc-
tural tissue damage into account (7,8). 
Although the initial ischemic damage 
is focal, there is recognition of struc-
tural and functional alteration of distant 
brain regions due to the remote effects 
of lesions mainly reflecting Wallerian 
and transsynaptic degeneration (9).
White matter ultrastructural dam-
age can be quantified with diffusion-
tensor imaging (DTI), which allows the 
study of interrelations between the full 
extent of vascular tissue damage be-
yond visible lesions and cognitive im-
pairment. Two DTI metrics, fractional 
anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusiv-
ity, were shown to be correlated with 
myelin content and axonal loss (10). 
Furthermore, FA and mean diffusivity 
maps can be subjected to whole-brain 
voxel-based or tract-based analysis to 
overcome the recognized limitations of 
region of interest analysis (11).

Advances in Knowledge
 
n In patients with carotid artery 
disease, cerebrovascular lesion 
location in the thalamic radiation 
and interhemispheric fiber tracts 
contributes to global cognitive 
deficits, and lesions in the tha-
lamic radiation and long associa-
tion fibers affect fluency 
performance.
 
n Severity of subcortical tissue 
damage, preferentially in major 
white matter tracts, contributes 
to global cognitive impairment 
(R2 = 0.311, P , .001), with skel-
eton mean diffusivity as the best-
performing imaging marker for 
the prediction of probable vascu-
lar cognitive disorder (area 
under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve, 0.82 [95% 
confidence interval: 0.75, 0.90]).
 
n Findings were confirmed in 
patients with low risk of comor-
bid Alzheimer disease (absence 
of medial temporal lobe atrophy 
[MTA]), while presence of MTA 
was associated with more severe 
cognitive impairment, increased 
vascular lesion load, and more 
severe tissue damage.
 
n Disconnection of large-scale cog-
nitive neural networks from cu-
mulative lesional and nonlesional 
tract injuries is proposed as a 
mechanism of cognitive impair-
ment in advanced 
arteriosclerosis.
Implication for Patient Care
 
n The findings provide insights into 
how cerebrovascular disease con-
tributes to cognitive impairment 
and/or dementia and highlight 
the need to combat progressive 
subcortical brain tissue damage; 
average white matter skeleton 
mean diffusivity shows potential 
as a simple diagnostic marker of 
subcortical disconnection under-
lying vascular cognitive disorder.
T
he prevalence of vascular cog-
nitive impairment and vascular 
dementia, which can be summa-
rized as vascular cognitive disorder (1), 
is increasing in the elderly (2). Diagnos-
ing vascular cognitive disorder remains 
challenging, and up to 44% of patients 
have coincident vascular and Alzheimer 
disease pathologic processes (3). New 
diagnostic criteria have been proposed 
to classify the disease as being probable 
or possible vascular cognitive disorder 
(4). To date, no useful imaging bio-
markers have been identified for vas-
cular cognitive disorder, and exclusion

selective T1-weighted three-dimension-
al gradient-echo sequence (repetition 
time msec/echo time msec, 8.8/4.11; 
inversion time, 570 msec; field of view, 
92 3 162; matrix, 384 3 384; and 102 
sections of 0.9-mm thickness acquired, 
covering the hippocampal formation 
fully in 50 cases).
Preprocessing of DTI data sets and 
computation of FA and mean diffusiv-
ity maps were performed by using the 
diffusion toolbox of FSL (Oxford Cen-
tre for Functional Magnetic Resonance 
Imaging of the Brain [FMRIB] Software 
Library, Oxford, England) (15). Isotro-
pic maximum diffusion images with a 
 
b value of 1000 sec/mm2 extracted from 
DTI images and mean diffusivity maps 
were used to outline acute ischemic 
lesions.
MTA Assessment
MTA was rated per subject on recon-
structed coronal FLAIR images by us-
ing the Scheltens scale (16) (D.M., 
with 6 years of neuroimaging training; 
and Q.S., a neurology trainee with a 
master of science in translational neu-
roimaging; supervised by D.P.A., with 
more than 25 years of quantitative neu-
roimaging research experience). Visual 
rating for all subjects was performed 
twice to study intrarater reliability. To 
validate the reliability of using recon-
structed FLAIR images to assess MTA, 
the Scheltens scale was also applied 
to all subjects who had coronal T1-
weighted images sufficiently covering 
the hippocampal formation (n = 50, 
D.M.). Assessments were performed 
while blinded to the patients’ age and 
clinical information. Presence of MTA 
was defined by using the following age 
range–specific cutoffs for the mean 
MTA scores (the averaged value of both 
hemispheres): MTA of more than 1.5 
in patients younger than 75 years of 
age, MTA of more than 2 in patients 
at least 75 years of age, and MTA of 
more than 2.5 in patients at least 85 
years of age (17). To validate the re-
liability of MTA assessment, intermo-
dality agreement (n = 50), interrater 
agreement (n = 108), and intrarater 
agreement (n = 108) were analyzed. 
Patients were further classified into 
of MR imaging. Participants were cat-
egorized as being cognitively intact or 
impaired on the basis of a cutoff value 
of 82, according to proven good sensi-
tivity and specificity for defining cog-
nitive impairment (14). Normal daily 
functioning could be normal or mildly 
impaired, independent of the presence 
of motor and/or sensory symptoms.
In the cognitively impaired sub-
group, we further excluded subjects in 
whom a nonvascular cause of cognitive 
disorder was considered clinically. Ac-
cording to published diagnostic criteria 
(4), the following criteria for proba-
ble vascular cognitive disorder had to 
be met: (a) cognitive impairment (de-
fined in our study as ACE-R score , 
82), (b) imaging evidence of cerebro-
vascular disease (defined in our study 
as a chronic or acute ischemic lesion 
at fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery 
[FLAIR] imaging or diffusion-weighted 
imaging), (c) clear temporal relation-
ship between cerebrovascular disease 
and cognitive impairment, (d) no evi-
dence of another neurodegenerative 
disorder that may affect cognition 
before the onset of cerebrovascular 
disease, and (e) no history of gradually 
progressive cognitive impairment be-
fore or after manifestation of the cere-
brovascular disease. Criteria b–e were 
assessed clinically (by A.A.H., with 9 
years of clinical experience).
Image Acquisition
All MR images were acquired with a 3.0-
T imaging unit (Achieva; Philips Medi-
cal Systems, Best, the Netherlands). 
The imaging protocol included axial DTI 
(spin-echo single-shot diffusion-weight-
ed echo-planar imaging with a b value 
[gradient factor] of 1000 sec/mm2, 15 
directions, one volume with a b value 
of 0 sec/mm2 acquired, repetition time 
[sec]/echo time [msec] of 4.2/57, field 
of view of 224 3 224, matrix of 112 3 
112, and 45 sections of 3-mm thick-
ness acquired), axial FLAIR imaging 
(repetition time [sec]/echo time [sec] 
of 10.5/0.14; inversion time, 2.75 sec-
onds; field of view, 224 3 192; matrix, 
224 3 181; and 45 sections of 3-mm 
thickness acquired), and a plaque hem-
orrhage–sensitive, blood-nulled, water- 
processes in our elderly cohort, we as-
sessed whether imaging and cognitive 
associations were similar in the sub-
group of patients at low risk for preclin-
ical Alzheimer disease—namely, those 
without medial temporal lobe atrophy 
(MTA). Second, we examined whether 
presence of MTA affected the vascular 
lesion load and nonlesional tissue dam-
age and used a multivariate prediction 
model of cognitive disorder to assess 
the independent contributions of vascu-
lar damage and MTA.
Materials and Methods
Subjects
The study protocol was approved by 
the ethics committee, and all partici-
pants gave written informed consent 
to undergo brain magnetic resonance 
(MR) imaging and the Addenbrooke’s 
Cognitive Examination–Revised (ACE-
R). Participants were recruited from 
a CAD imaging study that will be re-
ported elsewhere. From 2010 to 2015, 
subjects were recruited for the CAD 
imaging study (by A.A.H. and R.J.S.) 
if they experienced a recent nondis-
abling cerebrovascular event (stroke, 
transient ischemic attack, or amaurosis 
fugax) and were found to have ipsilat-
eral carotid arterial stenosis of more 
than 30%. Exclusion criteria were con-
traindications to MR imaging, language 
or sensory difficulties that would in-
terfere with cognitive assessment, and 
pre-existing cognitive impairment with 
possible causes other than vascular 
events. Research investigators (A.A.H. 
and R.J.S.) reviewed the clinical notes, 
spoke to all participants, and excluded 
(a) patients without the capacity to 
consent and (b) those with clinically ap-
parent or documented dementia before 
enrollment.
Cognitive Assessment and Criteria of 
Possible and Probable Vascular Cognitive 
Disorder
One hundred forty-seven CAD imaging 
study participants agreed to undergo 
cognitive assessments by using the ACE-
R (14), which was conducted by trained 
researchers (A.A.H., R.J.S.) on the day

of hippocampal atrophy, we repeated 
all imaging analysis in the subgroup of 
patients without MTA.
Statistical Analysis
The spatial distribution of two kinds 
of lesion maps was compared on a 
voxel-by-voxel basis by using a Fisher 
test (with the false discovery rate con-
trolled at 0.05) as implemented in the 
NeuRoi software package (http://www.
nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/
clinicalneurology/neuroi.aspx).
Reliability 
and 
agreement 
analysis.—
The inter- and intrarater reliability and 
the agreement of MTA measurement on 
reconstructed FLAIR images with that 
on coronal three-dimensional T1-weight-
ed gradient-echo images were assessed 
by using the Cohen k coefficient.
VLSM 
analysis.—Nonparametric 
mapping was used to relate lesion loca-
tion and cognitive performance (t test). 
 
Voxels affected in fewer than four sub-
jects (the default setting in VLSM) 
were not considered for analysis. False 
discovery rate was used to correct for 
multiple comparisons.
TBSS analysis.—The voxelwise sta-
tistical analysis of the DTI data was 
based on a nonparametric method by 
using a permutation test (n = 5000) with 
a general linear-model design matrix 
(25).
Tissue damage severity.—The age-
independent interrelations between se-
verity of tissue damage and cognition 
were assessed by using SPSS version 
21 software (SPSS, Chicago, Ill). The 
correlation coefficients were compared 
by using VassarStats software (http://
www.vassarstats.net/index.html).
Prediction models.—Univariate re-
gression analysis was first performed to 
initially explore the predictive value of 
age and various imaging markers, in-
cluding normalized volumes of lacunar 
infarctions, acute and chronic ischemic 
lesions, mean diffusivity values of in-
farctions, chronic subcortical ischemic 
lesions, NAWM and WMT skeleton, 
and MTA for cognitive status. Given the 
number of cognitively impaired subjects 
(n = 53), five factors were selected for 
creating the multivariate prediction 
model.
The total ischemic lesion load was 
calculated by adding the normalized 
volumes of nonoverlapping acute and 
chronic lesions and was logarithmically 
expressed to account for nonnormal 
distribution.
Lesion Topography, White Matter Tract 
Topography, and Tissue Damage Severity
Since results of a previous study dem-
onstrated the strategic role of lacunar 
infarctions located at the hippocampus, 
thalamus, mesial temporal areas, basal 
forebrain, and frontocingular cortex in 
vascular dementia (21), the frequency 
of infarctions at these locations was 
recorded.
Voxel-based lesion-symptom map-
ping (VLSM) (http://www.neuroling.
arizona.edu/resources.html) was used 
to determine lesion locations associ-
ated with cognition and fluency (22). 
All analyses were controlled for age and 
total ischemic lesion load (logarithmi-
cally expressed). Additionally, perfor-
mance of memory, language, attention, 
and visuospatial ability derived from 
ACE-R was controlled for when assess-
ing the association between lesion lo-
cations and fluency. Significant voxels 
were projected onto the 1 3 1 3 1-mm 
MNI template, and major white matter 
tracts (WMTs) that contained signifi-
cant clusters were identified from the 
WMT atlas within FSL (23).
Whole white matter ultrastructural 
damage and its association with global 
cognition and fluency were investigated 
by means of tract-based spatial statis-
tics (TBSS) on FA and mean diffusivity 
maps. The standard TBSS procedure 
was applied to this study (24).
Mean diffusivity values were de-
rived from each individual’s maps of 
chronic subcortical ischemic lesions, 
 
normal-appearing white matter (NA
WM), 
and WMT skeleton to investigate tissue-
specific injury. Infarction severity was 
not studied owing to the mixed type of 
infarctions, which may confound the as-
sessment of severity of tissue damage.
To confirm whether the imaging-
cognitive associations were indepen-
dent of potentially comorbid but pre-
clinical Alzheimer disease pathologic 
processes, as indexed by the presence 
two subgroups according to their MTA 
score: those with MTA and those with-
out. Patients without MTA who have 
clinically probable vascular cognitive 
disorder can be considered to have a 
low risk of having comorbid Alzheimer 
disease (18).
Lesion Mapping
FLAIR and diffusion images were reg-
istered into Montreal Neurological In-
stitute (MNI) template space by using 
FSL tools (19). Lacunar infarctions, 
acute ischemic infarctions, chronic 
subcortical ischemic lesions, and cor-
tical infarctions were separately and 
manually outlined (by D.M., a trained 
investigator) on coregistered images 
by using locally developed NeuRoi soft-
ware (http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/ 
research/groups/clinicalneurology/
neuroi.aspx). Lacunar infarctions were 
 
defined as small (,20-mm) hypoin-
tense subcortical areas on FLAIR im-
ages. Hyperintense lesions on images 
acquired with a b value of 1000 sec/
mm2 that were hypointense on mean 
diffusivity maps were considered acute 
 
ischemic infarctions. Subcortical FLAIR 
 
hyperintense lesions were considered 
to reflect chronic subcortical ischemic 
lesions, and cortical FLAIR hypoin-
tensities were considered to reflect 
chronic cortical infarctions. Then, three 
 
kinds of lesion maps were generated: 
(a) an “infarction frequency map” in-
cluded acute ischemic infarctions and 
chronic cortical and lacunar infarc-
tions, (b) a “chronic subcortical ische-
mia frequency map” was generated by 
adding chronic subcortical ischemic 
lesions, and (c) a “total ischemic lesion 
frequency map” was created by com-
bining both maps.
Lesion Burden
Lesion type–specific volumes were 
calculated by using NeuRoi software. 
FLAIR brain images without skull, ex-
tracted by using the “Brain Extraction 
Tool” of the Oxford Centre for Func-
tional Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
of the Brain (20), were loaded into 
NeuRoi for calculating total brain vol-
umes. Lesion volumes were divided by 
total brain volumes for normalization.

Three strategic thalamic lacunar 
infarctions were seen in cognitively 
impaired patients (5.6%), but none 
were seen in cognitively intact sub-
jects. Cognitively impaired subjects (n 
= 53, 49.1%) also showed qualitatively 
more extended patterns of the infarc-
tions (Fig 1a) and chronic subcortical 
ischemia frequencies (Fig 1b), but the 
difference was not significant by using 
voxel-based analysis (false discovery 
rate corrected, P . .05). Additionally, 
according to visual inspection, no in-
farctions or chronic subcortical ische-
mic lesions were located in the known 
language brain areas, such as superior 
and middle temporal gyri, inferior fron-
tal gyri, and insula, which may affect 
language performance (26).

Neuroimaging Differences between 
Cognitively Impaired Patients and 
Unimpaired Patients
Cognitively impaired patients had 
larger normalized acute lesion vol-
umes (mean 6 standard deviation, 
[5.9 6 11.3] 3 1024 for cognitively 
impaired patients vs [2.7 6 5.1] 3 
1024 for cognitively intact patients; 
 
P = .028), higher chronic subcortical 
ischemic volumes ([15.5 6 15.5] 3 
1023 for cognitively impaired patients 
vs [8.0 6 10.5] 3 1023 for cognitively 
intact patients, P = .009), and more 
cortical infarctions (n = 4 [3.7%] cog-
nitively impaired patients; n = 0 [0%] 
cognitively intact patients; P = .016) 
after controlling for age (Table 2). 
Similar group differences were found 
in the subgroup without MTA (Table 
E1 [online]).
The area under the receiver oper-
ating characteristic curve for the di-
agnosis of probable vascular cognitive 
disorder was constructed by using SPSS 
software for the imaging metrics se-
lected from the prediction model.
A P value less than .05 was consid-
ered to indicate a significant difference 
for all analyses.
Results
Of the 147 participants, 38 had to be 
excluded owing to incomplete MR ex-
amination or poor quality of MR images 
as assessed visually, and one subject 
was excluded because of comorbid Par-
kinson disease that likely contributed 
to cognitive impairment. This resulted 
in a cohort of 108 subjects. Fifty-three 
patients (49.1%) were cognitively im-
paired and were classified as having 
probable vascular cognitive disorder. 
Forty-eight of these had experienced 
first-ever stroke without any known 
cognitive impairment or other relevant 
background. Four subjects had a pre-
vious history of poststroke cognitive 
impairment with subsequent partial im-
provement, and one subject later devel-
oped cerebral hemorrhage, which was 
considered to be amyloid angiopathy. 
Patients with abnormal cognition were 
older (P = .027), had a higher percent-
age of smokers (P = .015), and had 
more peripheral vascular disease (P = 
.017) than those with normal cognition 
(n = 55, 50.9%). Of the 108 subjects, 
98 subjects (90.7%) were not at risk 
for cerebral hemodynamic impairment 
due to carotid stenosis of less than 80% 
on either side or both sides (Table 1). 
Among 10 subjects who had carotid ste-
nosis of more than 80% on either side, 
three subjects had bilaterial carotid ste-
nosis of more than 80%.
MTA scores showed high inter- and 
intrarater reliability and similarly good 
agreement between assessment on FLAIR 
images and coronal T1-weighted images 
(Appendix E1 [online]). Twenty-three 
subjects (21.3%) had MTA, while 85 sub-
jects (78.7%) did not. Most subjects with 
MTA were cognitively impaired (n = 20, 
87.0%), compared with 33 (38.8%) of 
those without MTA (P , .001).

Neuroimaging Findings and Cognitive 
Impairment: Correlation Analyses
None of the normalized lesion type vol-
umes were significantly correlated with 
global cognition (lacunar infarctions, 
 
P = .060; acute lesions, P = .088; 
chronic subcortical ischemic lesions, P 
= .085). In contrast, normalized lacu-
nar infarction volumes (R2 = 0.07, P = 
.005) and chronic subcortical ischemic 
lesion volumes (R2 = 0.07, P = .007) 
were negatively correlated with fluency 
performance (Table 2). Interestingly, in 
patients without MTA, normalized lacu-
nar infarction volumes were correlated 
with both global cognition (R2 = 0.06, 
P = .030) and fluency (R2 = 0.08, P = 
.007), while normalized acute lesion 
volumes were correlated with global 
cognition (R2 = 0.06, P = .020) but not 
fluency (Table E1 [online]).
Significant correlations were identi-
fied between clusters of chronic subcor-
tical ischemia presence and global cog-
nition and fluency (false discovery rate, 
q = 0.05; threshold, t = 2.4) by using 
 
VLSM. A total of 159 and 1351 vox-
els were identified in which presence 
of chronic subcortical ischemia was 
significantly related to impaired global

cognition and chronic subcortical is-
chemic lesion mean diffusivity (P = 
.018) or NAWM mean diffusivity (P = 
.004).
Predictive Value and Diagnostic Accuracy 
of Imaging Measures
On the basis of univariate regres-
sion analyses, normalized volume of 
chronic subcortical ischemic lesions 
(P = .007), mean diffusivity of chronic 
subcortical ischemic lesions (P = 
.004), NAWM (P = .001), WMT skel-
eton (P , .001), and MTA (P , .001) 
were found to be predictors of cogni-
tive status. After entering these fac-
tors into the multivariate prediction 
model, WMT skeleton mean diffusiv-
ity (P = .001, exp[b] = 38.880 [95% 
CI: 4.207, 359.336]) and MTA score 
(P = .015, exp[b] = 6.074 [95% CI: 
1.426, 25.867]) remained as the only 
4; Fig 3, B). The analyses of correla-
tion between FA and global cognition 
yielded similar results (Fig E3 [on-
line]). No significant correlation was 
identified between FA and fluency. The 
pattern of widespread WMT damage 
associated with impaired cognition in 
the subgroup of patients without MTA 
was similar to that in the whole study 
cohort (Fig E4 [online]). We found a 
consistent, indirect interrelation be-
tween tissue-specific mean diffusiv-
ity and cognitive performance after 
controlling for age (chronic subcorti-
cal ischemic lesions, R2 = 0.090 [P = 
.002]; NAWM, R2 = 0.074 [P = .005]; 
WMT skeleton, R2 = 0.311 [P , .001]) 
(Table 3, Fig 4). Similar interrelations 
were also identified in patients with-
out MTA (n = 85) (Table E2 [online]). 
Also, the partial correlation between 
global cognition and WMT skele-
ton mean diffusivity was significantly 
cognition and fluency, respectively. 
Clusters for global cognition were 
mainly projected onto the anterior 
thalamic radiation, forceps minor, and 
forceps major (Table 4; Fig 2, A). Clus-
ters for fluency were mainly projected 
onto the anterior thalamic radiation 
and superior longitudinal fasciculus 
(Table 4; Fig 2, B). No significant clus-
ters were identified for the infarction 
frequency maps and global cognition 
or fluency. Similar results were identi-
fied in patients without MTA (n = 85, 
Fig E2 [online]).
Age-independent correlation be-
tween WMT mean diffusivity and 
global cognition was widespread on 
the basis of TBSS (Table 4; Fig 3, A). 
 
A similar correlation pattern was 
identified between fluency and mean 
diffusivity of widespread white mat-
ter except forceps major and right 
inferior longitudinal fasciculus (Table

Figure 2
Figure 2: A, Maps show the topography of 
chronic ischemic lesions associated with global 
cognitive impairment. Significant clusters (red) ac-
cording to VLSM analysis (P , .05, false discovery 
rate corrected, controlled for age and normalized 
total ischemic lesion volumes after logarithmic 
transformation) are projected onto the MNI152 
standard-space T1-weighted average structural 
template image with overlain selected WMTs from 
the Johns Hopkins University DTI-based white 
matter atlas (yellow, forceps major; brown, anterior

of WMT damage, indexed according 
to mean diffusivity increase, were as-
sociated with cognitive impairment. 
These results suggest that subcorti-
cal disconnection of large-scale cogni-
tive neural networks that result from 
strategic and cumulative lesional and 
nonlesional tract damage play a key role 
in cognitive impairment in advanced 
 
arteriosclerosis.
Our findings confirm and extend 
the strategic role of anterior thalamic 
radiation and interhemispheric fiber 
damages as a mechanism of cognitive 
impairment, as previously shown in 
small-vessel disease (27) and in mani-
fest vascular disease due to arterioscle-
rosis anywhere (28). The identification 
of anterior thalamic radiation and su-
perior longitudinal fasciculus as strate-
gic WMTs for fluency in our study also 
closely replicates results in manifest 
vascular disease (28). The consistency 
of findings across different patient co-
horts highlights that lesion location 
rather than disease origin determines 
cognitive outcomes. This in turn is con-
cordant with our current understand-
ing that disconnection of large-scale 
cognitive networks through the ante-
rior thalamic radiation and the forceps 
minor underlies vascular cognitive dis-
order in both small- and large-artery 
disease. In contrast to previous studies 
in vascular disease, we found a key role 
of the forceps major in global cogni-
tion (27,28). This partial discrepancy 
could be due to the differences in the 
underlying vasculopathy but is more 
likely due to variation in cognitive as-
sessments. In previous studies, inves-
tigators focused on processing speed

It is noteworthy that cognitively 
impaired subjects with MTA showed 
more extensive ultrastructural white 
matter damage than those without 
MTA, even after age correction (Table 
3). While speculative, this association 
would be consistent with the notion 
of supra-additive cognitive effects of 
vascular and neurodegenerative path-
ologic processes (37,38) that may 
further contribute to the recognized 
increasing prevalence of mixed path-
ologic findings in the elderly (3). Fu-
ture research is needed to confirm 
and further characterize such interac-
tions and putative responsiveness to 
therapeutic interventions. This will be 
facilitated by the combined use of two 
simple imaging measures from stan-
dard brain MR imaging examinations: 
MTA as an established marker of hip-
pocampal pathologic abnormalities 
and WMT skeleton mean diffusivity, 
are thought to reflect primary or sec-
ondary tissue damage, including Walle-
rian degeneration with myelin damage, 
axonal loss, gliosis, and incomplete 
ischemia (35,36). We thus consider 
that the observed WMT ultrastruc-
tural damage reflects cumulative focal 
and remote effects of vascular tissue 
damage, thereby providing a more re-
liable index of cerebrovascular lesion 
burden than lesions visible on MR im-
ages do. This is corroborated by the 
finding that lesion volumes played no 
role or only a minor role in explain-
ing global cognitive and fluency per-
formance, which is well in line with 
previous reports (7,36). Taken to-
gether, topographic, volumetric, and 
diffusivity findings converge and point 
to a key role of subcortical disconnec-
tion within large-scale cognitive neural 
networks that may underpin vascular 
cognitive disorder.
or executive function, which mainly re-
flect frontal lobe dysfunctions (27,28). 
Forceps major integrity, on the other 
hand, has been related to memory, at-
tention, and executive functions (29). 
Interestingly, the global cognitive role 
of the forceps major in nonvascular 
brain diseases, such as multiple scle-
rosis (30,31), suggests that consistent 
structural-cognitive interrelations exist 
in disconnection disorders across dif-
ferent diseases.
The observed widespread age-
independent 
associations 
between 
ultrastructural white matter damage 
and global cognition, as well as flu-
ency, agree well with the results of 
previous studies in patients with sub-
cortical vascular dementia (32), cere-
bral autosomal-dominant arteriopathy 
with subcortical infarcts and leukoen-
cephalopathy (33), and mild cognitive 
impairment (34). Diffusional changes

of our cohort showed MTA. Impor-
tantly, all main findings reported in 
the whole study group were confirmed 
in the subgroup of subjects without 
MTA, considered to be at low risk of 
Alzheimer disease. This allows us to 
largely exclude a confounding effect 
from undetected Alzheimer disease.

to MR imaging. This is, however, un-
likely to have biased our results, as we 
did not observe cognitive associations 
with acute infarction metrics. Last, 
in this study, we did not investigate 
the presence of hemodynamic impair-
ment and hence cannot exclude this 
as a contributory factor in individual 
subjects. Nevertheless, only 10 of 108 
subjects (9.3%) had more than 80% 
carotid arterial stenosis, and only a 
investigator with up to 9 years of clin-
ical experiences (A.A.H.) spoke to all 
participants and carefully reviewed 
clinical notes to exclude patients with-
out the capacity to consent and those 
with clinically apparent dementia be-
fore MR imaging examination. Also, 
on the basis of the clinical information 
and the published diagnostic criteria, 
all 53 cognitively impaired subjects in 
our cohort were considered to have 
probable vascular cognitive disorder. 
Nevertheless, we cannot exclude pre-
morbid Alzheimer disease, with an 
expected prevalence of 11%–20% in 
those aged 65 and older (40,41). In 
the absence of amyloid PET data, we 
used the indirect marker of MTA with 
proven high positive and negative pre-
dictive value for Alzheimer disease 
(17,18). We found that just over 21% 
which we propose as a new, promis-
ing marker of subcortical disconnec-
tion. WMT skeleton mean diffusivity 
also has potential as an imaging bio-
marker of vascular cognitive disorder 
(area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve, 0.82; sensitiv-
ity, 77.4%; specificity, 72.7%). The 
lower specificity compared with cere-
brospinal fluid biomarkers (sensitivity, 
68%; specificity, 87%) (39) could be 
explained by the milder end of the cog-
nitive deficit profile in our study.
The main limitations of our study 
are a lack of neuropsychometric infor-
mation on premorbid cognition due to 
the study design and a lack of direct 
diagnostic tools for amyloid pathologic 
abnormalities. We are, however, con-
fident that we excluded patients with 
premorbid dementia, as a research

In conclusion, we demonstrated 
that lesional and ultrastructural affec-
tion of the WMT skeleton contributes 
to cognitive impairment in patients 
with recently symptomatic CAD, inde-
pendent of the effect of age, and also 
in patients without MTA. This supports 
the notion that subcortical disconnec-
tion of cognitive neural networks is a 
key mechanism of cognitive impairment 
in patients with probable vascular cog-
nitive disorder.
