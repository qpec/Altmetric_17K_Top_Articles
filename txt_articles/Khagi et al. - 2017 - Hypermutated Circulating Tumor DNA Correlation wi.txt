Abstract
Purpose: Tumor mutational burden detected by tissue next-
generation sequencing (NGS) correlates with checkpoint inhib-
itor response. However, tissue biopsy may be costly and invasive.
We sought to investigate the association between hypermutated
blood-derived circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and checkpoint
inhibitor response.
Experimental Design: We assessed 69 patients with diverse
malignancies who received checkpoint inhibitor–based immuno-
therapy and blood-derived ctDNA NGS testing (54–70 genes). Rates
of stable disease (SD) �6 months, partial and complete response
(PR, CR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS)
were assessed based on total and VUS alterations.
Results: Statistically significant improvement in PFS was
associated with high versus low alteration number in variants
of unknown significance (VUS, >3 alterations versus VUS �3
alterations), SD �6 months/PR/CR 45% versus 15%, respec-
tively; P ¼ 0.014. Similar results were seen with high versus
low total alteration number (characterized plus VUS, �6 vs.
<6). Statistically significant OS improvement was also asso-
ciated with high VUS alteration status. Two-month landmark
analysis
showed
that
responders
versus
nonresponders
with VUS >3 had a median PFS of 23 versus 2.3 months
(P ¼ 0.0004).
Conclusions: Given the association of alteration number on
liquid biopsy and checkpoint inhibitor–based immunotherapy
outcomes, further investigation of hypermutated ctDNA as a
predictive biomarker is warranted. Clin Cancer Res; 23(19); 5729–36.

Introduction
Checkpoint inhibitor–based immunotherapy has revolution-
ized treatment for malignancies across several histologies. For
example, the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab demonstrated a
response rate of about 45% in a biomarker-selected population
[defined as tumor immunohistochemical (IHC) PD-L1 staining
>50%] in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; ref. 1). Pembro-
lizumab is now approved in the first-line setting for biomarker-
selected advanced NSCLC without sensitizing EGFR or ALK
alterations. Other checkpoint inhibitors, such as the anti–
CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab and anti–PD-1 antibody nivolu-
mab, as well as the anti–PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab, have
demonstrated clinically significant efficacy for malignancies
ranging from advanced melanoma to head and neck cancers,
renal cell cancer, urothelial cancer, NSCLC, and colorectal
cancer (2). Additionally, checkpoint blockade has demonstrated
impressive response rates in hematologic malignancies, such as
B-cell lymphomas (3).
Despite the undoubted efficacy of many of these immunothera-
pies, immune-related adverse effects are not negligible. For exam-
ple, in a retrospective review of 14 phase I to III ipilimumab trials
involving 1,500 patients, 64.2% of patients experienced some
degree of toxicity, with 20% to 30% experiencing grade 3–4
immune-related side effects (including gastrointestinal, dermato-
logic, hepatic, endocrine, or pulmonary adverse events; ref. 4).
Anti–PD-1 use has also been found to result in a rate of severe
toxicity of approximately 6% (5). Furthermore, the majority of
patients do not respond to therapy, and a subset of patients may
experience hyperprogression (6, 7). For these reasons, it has
become evident that predictive biomarkers of response are needed
for these novel agents.
Recently, tumor mutational burden, as detected by tissue next-
generation sequencing (NGS), has been shown to correlate with
response to checkpoint inhibitors in several malignancies (8).
This is not unexpected, because the immune system, once reacti-
vated by checkpoint inhibitors, recognizes tumor cells because
they present neoantigens derived from the mutanome. Presum-
ably, the more neoantigens presented, the better the chances that
the immune T-cell machinery will be triggered to eradicate the
presenting cancer cell. Unfortunately, obtaining tissue biopsies in
order to determine tumor mutational burden is at times difficult.
We therefore investigated the utility of blood-derived circulating
tumor DNA (ctDNA) in determining a hypermutated state and
response to immunotherapy.

Patient data
Overall, 1,262 patients who had NGS (54 to 70 genes:
Guardant Health) performed on cell-free, ctDNA derived from
liquid (blood) biopsies were analyzed. Those who had solid
malignancies and had received checkpoint inhibitor–based
immunotherapy from December 2011 to December 2016 (N
¼ 69 patients) were the subjects of this study. Of those 69
individuals, three were not evaluable for response (one whose
baseline imaging was not traceable and two who were lost to
follow-up before first restaging). The remaining 66 patients were
evaluated for overall rate of stable disease (SD) �6 months,
partial response (PR), or complete response (CR). All 69
patients were considered evaluable for progression-free survival
(PFS) and overall survival (OS). In those situations where
patients received multiple lines of immunotherapy, SD �6
months/PR/CR was assessed based on the first immunotherapy.
Similarly, PFS and OS were assessed from cycle 1, day 1 of the
first
immunotherapy.
In
those
situations
where
patients
received multiple ctDNA analyses, data were used from the
analysis closest to the date of initiation of first immunotherapy.
Survival analyses were performed on variants of unknown
significance (UVS) and total ctDNA alterations using cutoffs of
3 and 6 alterations (the mean values for numbers of these
alterations across patients), respectively. All studies and analy-
ses were performed in accordance with the ethical guidelines of
the Declaration of Helsinki and the Belmont Report per a
University of California San Diego, Internal Review Board-
approved protocol (NCT02478931) and the investigational
treatment protocols for which the patients gave written consent.

by
a
Clinical
Laboratory
Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified and College of
American Pathologists (CAP)-accredited clinical laboratory,
Guardant Health, Inc. (http://www.guardanthealth.com). The
Guardant360 (54 to 70 gene) test identifies characterized and
VUS tumor-related genomic alterations within cancer-related
genes. The data are analyzed from ctDNA extracted from
plasma (two 10-mL blood tubes). This ctDNA assay has a
sensitivity and specificity of 85%þ and >99.9999%, respective-
ly, for detection of single-nucleotide variants in tumor tissue of
advanced cancer patients (9).
Statistical analysis
For comparing rates of SD �6 months/PR/CR, the Fisher exact
test was used to calculate P values with a 95% confidence interval
(CI). For PFS and OS, Kaplan–Meier analysis was used with the
log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test to generate P values. Hazard ratios
and confidence intervals using log-rank analysis were also calcu-
lated. Those patients whose status was known and who had not
progressed (for PFS) or died (for OS) at the time of last follow-up
or the cutoff date for analysis (January 12, 2017) were censored at
that date. Kaplan–Meier analyses for PFS and OS were also
performed based on status at a 2-month landmark.
Results
Patient demographics
Overall, 66 patients were evaluable for SD �6 months/PR/CR;
69 patients were evaluable for PFS and OS (N ¼ 18 tumor
types; Table 1). Median patient age was 56 years (range, 22–85
years). Forty-three patients (62.3%) were men. The most common
tumor types were melanoma, lung cancer, and head and neck
cancer. The most common type of immunotherapy used was anti–
PD-1 or PD-L1 monotherapy, which was administered to 54
patients (79.7%).
ctDNA findings
Overall, 63 patients (91%) had at least one ctDNA alteration.
The median number of VUSs per patient was 2 (range, 0–20; mean
¼ 3). The median number of characterized alterations per patient
was 1 (range, 0–25; mean ¼ 3). The median number of total
alterations per patient (which include characterized and total
VUSs) was 3 (range, 0–37; mean ¼ 6).
Of 69 patients, 20 (29%) had >3 VUSs in their circulating-
tumor DNA (ctDNA) versus 71% with �3 VUS ctDNA alterations.
Twenty-three patients (33.3%) had �6 total ctDNA alterations
(characterized alterations plus total VUS alterations) and 66.7%
had <6 total ctDNA alterations.
Relationship of immunotherapy outcome and number of
ctDNA alterations
Response (SD �6 months/PR/CR). Overall, 16 of 66 patients
(24%) achieved SD �6 months/PR/CR. Rates of SD �6
months/PR/CR differed significantly in those with >3 VUS altera-
tions versus those with �3 VUS alterations (45% vs. 15%, respec-
tively; P ¼ 0.014). Similarly, SD �6 months/PR/CR rates were
40.9% versus 15.9% (P ¼ 0.025; �6 vs. <6 total ctDNA alterations,
respectively; Table 1).
PFS
The median PFS for 69 patients in the study was 2.3 months
(95% CI, 0.7–5.0 months; Table 1). The median PFS for patients
with >3 versus <3 VUS was 3.84 versus 2.07 months (P ¼ 0.019;
HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.31–0.87; Fig. 1A). The median PFS for
patients with �6 versus <6 total ctDNA alterations was also
significantly different: 2.85 versus 2.19 months (P ¼ 0.025; HR,
0.59; 95% CI, 0.35–0.99; Supplementary Fig. S1A).
Two-month landmark analysis for PFS
Those patients achieving �2 months PFS from start of immu-
notherapy were included in this analysis (N ¼ 41). These patients
were further subdivided into responders (those achieving CR or
PR; N ¼ 15) and nonresponders (SD, or progressive disease, PD;
N ¼ 26). A landmark comparing responders to nonresponders in
the VUS >3 alterations group showed median PFS 23.2 months
versus 2.3 months (P ¼ 0.0004; HR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.035–0.61;
Translational Relevance
This is the first analysis demonstrating a correlation between
high alteration number detected in blood-derived circulating
tumor DNA and favorable outcome, including overall
response, progression-free survival, and overall survival with
checkpoint inhibitor–based immunotherapy. These data pro-
vide the impetus to further investigate liquid biopsy as a
viable, noninvasive, predictive biomarker for checkpoint
inhibitor response across various histologies.

 Fig. 2A). Similarly, 2-month landmark analysis (responders vs.
nonresponders) in the �6 total ctDNA alterations group showed
median PFS 23.2 versus 2.3 months (P ¼ 0.0006; HR, 0.15; 95%
CI, 0.038–0.63; Supplementary Fig. S2A).
Landmark analyses were also performed for responders versus
nonresponders in the �3 VUS alteration group and <6 total
alteration group. Median PFS was significantly improved for
responders in both groups (Fig. 2B; Supplementary Fig. S2B).
Landmark analyses for responders in the >3 versus �3 VUS
alteration groups showed a PFS of 23.2 versus 11.7 months, but
this was not statistically significant. However, there were only 8
and 7 patients in each group, respectively (Fig. 2C). Analogous
results were found for the �6 versus <6 total ctDNA alteration
groups (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
Similar landmark analyses were done for nonresponders in the
>3 VUS versus �3 VUS alterations groups (N ¼ 7 vs. N ¼ 19
patients, respectively), which showed a median PFS of 2.3 versus
3.6 months (P ¼ 0.82; Fig. 2D); analogous results were found for
the �6 versus <6 total ctDNA alterations groups (Supplementary
Fig. S2D).
Overall survival. The median OS for 69 patients in the study was
15.3 months (95% CI, 10.6–23.9 months) from the start of
immunotherapy (Table 1). The median OS for patients with >3
VUS alterations was not reached versus 10.72 months for
patients with �3 VUS (P ¼ 0.042; HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.18–
0.83; Fig. 1B). The median OS for patients with �6 total ctDNA
alterations was not reached versus 10.79 months for those with

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that
increased mutational burden, as reflected by the number of
blood-derived ctDNA alterations, correlates with response to
checkpoint inhibitor–based treatments. Previous studies have
shown a correlation between tumor mutational burden, as mea-
sured in tissue, and response to immunotherapy in diseases such
as lung cancer, melanoma, and urothelial cancer (8, 10–12).
Because ctDNA can be obtained by a blood test without need
for an invasive tissue biopsy, our current results may be clinically
exploitable.
Biomarkers predicting response to immunotherapy have been
investigated at the tissue DNA, RNA, and protein level. For
example, at the DNA level, PCR detection of altered microsatellite
foci in colorectal cancer has been predictive of response to anti–
PD-1-directed therapy (13). Microsatellite instability is associated
with defects in mismatch repair (MMR) genes that result in a
hypermutated state, which presumably enhances the chance of
response by increasing immunogenic neoantigen production by a
hypermutated genome (8, 14–16). At the transcript level, mRNA
sequences reflecting CD8-positive T cell and expanded immune
signatures within the tumor microenvironment also predict
response to checkpoint inhibitor therapy (17, 18). And, at the
protein level, PD-L1 expression (IHC) in tumor and/or stromal
cells is associated with higher response rates to checkpoint inhi-
bitors, though IHC variability limits the precision of this assay
(3, 19, 20). Specific mutational signatures, such as kataegis, a
pattern of base mutations associated with APOBEC (apolipopro-
tein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide) family over-
expression (correlating with viral presence) are also linked to PD-
L1 overexpression (21).

 As mentioned above, the role of hypermutated genomes in
response to checkpoint inhibitors is illustrated by several studies.
For instance, when comparing MMR-deficient versus MMR-pro-
ficient colorectal cancer, the overall response rate to pembrolizu-
mab was about 60% versus 0% (22). Other factors contributing to
hypermutation include dysfunction of DNA polymerase via germ-
line mutations and molecular "smoking signatures" in NSCLC
tumors that lead to differential mutational landscapes and

 upregulation of PD-L1 expression (16, 20, 23, 24). As mentioned,
other publications show a correlation between high tissue tumor
mutational burden and checkpoint inhibitor response in several
different tumor types (8, 10–12).
It therefore appears that tissue tumor mutational burden is
a useful test for predicting response to immunotherapy.
Still, presumably, mutational burden may change with time,
and repeat biopsies may be difficult to obtain. Additionally,

method of Kaplan and Meier, with log-rank P values. Course 1, day 1 of first immunotherapy represents starting point. Tick marks represent patients still alive at the
designated time; they were censored at that point. C, A 2-month landmark study for OS is shown for 15 patients treated with checkpoint inhibitor–based
immunotherapy who had achieved response (CR or PR). Comparison groups are those with >3 VUS ctDNA alterations (in blue) versus �3 VUS ctDNA alterations
(in red). Data are calculated by the method of Kaplan and Meier, with log-rank P values. Course 1, day 1 of first immunotherapy represents starting point. Tick
marks represent patients still alive at the designated time; they were censored at that point. D, A 2-month landmark study for OS is shown for 39 patients treated
with checkpoint inhibitor–based immunotherapy who had not achieved response (SD or PD). Comparison groups are those with >3 VUS ctDNA alterations
(in blue) versus �3 VUS ctDNA alterations (in red). Data are calculated by the method of Kaplan and Meier, with log-rank P values. Course 1, day 1 of first
immunotherapy represents starting point. Tick marks represent patients still alive at the designated time; they were censored at that point.

 obtaining tissue may be time consuming and invasive. Liquid
biopsies that assess blood-derived ctDNA are noninvasive,
easily acquired, and inexpensive. It is therefore of interest that,
in our study, we demonstrate that overall response rates
for patients in the high alteration groups (VUS>3 or total
alterations �6) is significantly higher than in those in low
alteration groups (VUS �3 or total alterations <6; 45% vs.
15%, respectively, for the VUS group, P ¼ 0.014). Similarly,
overall PFS and OS were significantly improved in patients
with high VUS compared with low VUS alteration number.
Analogous results for response rate and PFS were found when
all alterations (not just VUS) were examined and dichoto-
mized at �6 versus <6 alterations (Supplementary Fig. S1A
and S1B). In the 2-month landmark analysis, PFS was best in
those who had a response to checkpoint inhibitor–based
therapy and also fell into the high alteration groups (PFS
�23 months versus �2 months; responders vs. nonresponders;
P < 0.0006; Fig. 2A; Supplementary Fig. S2A). In contrast, 2-
month landmark PFS for responders versus nonresponders in
the low alteration group (VUS <3) was 11.7 versus 3.6 months
(P ¼ 0.002; Fig. 2B). Similarly, 2-month landmark for OS
showed longer survival in the responders versus nonrespon-
ders in the high alteration group (though not in the low
alteration group). The small numbers of patients in each of
the latter subgroups may have, however, precluded reaching
statistical significance. Taken together, these data suggest that
the hypermutated state, as assessed by ctDNA, correlates with
better outcomes after checkpoint inhibitor–based immuno-
therapy, and that responders with hypermutated ctDNA had a
median PFS that was close to two years.
There are several limitations to this study, including the fact
that it is retrospective and the sample size is small. It will be
important to perform larger prospective studies in the future.
Furthermore, the number of genes assayed in our ctDNA
analysis was only between 54 and 70. Unlike targeted NGS
of tumor tissue, which often tests for hundreds of genes and
allows a relatively accurate estimate of total mutational bur-
den, targeted NGS of plasma cfDNA provides only a limited
snapshot of the cancer genome. More extensive ctDNA gene
panels merit investigation to determine if they increase the
correlative value of our findings. Interestingly, Weiss et al.
recently reported that chromosomal instability as reflected by
copy number variation in cell-free DNA correlated with
response to immunotherapy, consistent with our observations
with number of alterations (25). Future studies should also
compare cfDNA and tissue NGS mutational burden, preferably
with biopsies and blood tests obtained on the same day. Yet
another limitation is that, while the majority of cfDNA analysis
was done prior to initiation on checkpoint inhibitor–based
immunotherapy (56 of 66 evaluable patients), 10 patients
began immunotherapy prior to cfDNA collection (median,
0.4 months). In the 56 patients who had cfDNA testing prior
to or on the day of initiation of immunotherapy, the median
time between cfDNA testing and start of immunotherapy was
1.6 months (range, 0–12 months). It is unknown at this time
how treatment initiation may have influenced cfDNA results in
these situations. Finally, we studied diverse tumor types and
therefore the impact of hypermutated DNA in individual
histologies was not assessable. Even so, the results may suggest
generalizability across malignancies.
In summary, liquid biopsies provide several advantages in that
they are easily obtained and less expensive than tissue biopsies.
The ctDNA derived from blood may also represent shed DNA
from multiple metastatic sites, whereas tissue genomics reflects
only the piece of tissue removed. Our data suggest that ctDNA-
determined hypermutated states predict improved response, PFS,
and OS after checkpoint inhibitor therapy across histologies.
Larger prospective studies are warranted to corroborate these
findings.
