OBJECTIVE Surgical decompression is extremely effective in relieving pain and symptoms due to lumbar spinal ste-
nosis (LSS). Decompression with interlaminar stabilization (D+ILS) is as effective as decompression with posterolateral 
fusion for stenosis, as shown in a major US FDA pivotal trial. This study reports a multicenter, randomized controlled trial 
in which D+ILS was compared with decompression alone (DA) for treatment of moderate to severe LSS.
METHODS Under approved institutional ethics review, 230 patients (1:1 ratio) randomized to either DA or D+ILS (coflex, 
Paradigm Spine) were treated at 7 sites in Germany. Patients had moderate to severe LSS at 1 or 2 adjacent segments 
from L-3 to L-5. Outcomes were evaluated up to 2 years postoperatively, including Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) 
scores, the presence of secondary surgery or lumbar injections, neurological status, and the presence of device- or 
procedure-related severe adverse events. The composite clinical success (CCS) was defined as combining all 4 of 
these outcomes, a success definition validated in a US FDA pivotal trial. Additional secondary end points included visual 
analog scale (VAS) scores, Zürich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ) scores, narcotic usage, walking tolerance, and 
radiographs.
RESULTS The overall follow-up rate was 91% at 2 years. There were no significant differences in patient-reported out-
comes at 24 months (p > 0.05). The CCS was superior for the D+ILS arm (p = 0.017). The risk of secondary intervention 
was 1.75 times higher among patients in the DA group than among those in the D+ILS group (p = 0.055). The DA arm 
had 228% more lumbar injections (4.5% for D+ILS vs 14.8% for DA; p = 0.0065) than the D+ILS one. Patients who un-
derwent DA had a numerically higher rate of narcotic use at every time point postsurgically (16.7% for D+ILS vs 23% for 
DA at 24 months). Walking Distance Test results were statistically significantly different from baseline; the D+ILS group 
had > 2 times the improvement of the DA. The patients who underwent D+ILS had > 5 times the improvement from base-
line compared with only 2 times the improvement from baseline for the DA group. Foraminal height and disc height were 
largely maintained in patients who underwent D+ILS, whereas patients treated with DA showed a significant decrease at 
24 months postoperatively (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS This study showed no significant difference in the individual patient-reported outcomes (e.g., ODI, 
VAS, ZCQ) between the treatments when viewed in isolation. The CCS (survivorship, ODI success, absence of neuro-
logical deterioration or device- or procedure-related severe adverse events) is statistically superior for ILS. Microsurgical 
D+ILS increases walking distance, decreases compensatory pain management, and maintains radiographic foraminal 
height, extending the durability and sustainability of a decompression procedure.

or the last 50 years, decompression surgery has 
been the standard of care for the amelioration of 
neurocompressive disease, or spinal stenosis, which 
is a degenerative disease generally regarded as part of the 
aging process, with progressive and debilitating symp-
tomatology leading to significant compromise of activi-
ties of daily living.3 Although extremely effective clini-
cally, decompression surgery does not arrest the disease 
progression, but rather addresses the presenting clinical 
symptoms. Even with surgical intervention, over time the 
functional quality of life may be affected because the dis-
ease progression may cause a recurrence of symptoms. 
Recent articles7,8,14,22 have elucidated that neither current 
surgical treatment options of decompression surgery nor 
decompression surgery with fusion5,20 is able to adequate-
ly address the full continuum of spinal stenosis.18,19
The progressive nature of lumbar degenerative pathol-
ogy can be multifactorial, with significant contribution 
from degenerative facets and from other sources of pathol-
ogy. Many clinicians debate whether simple microsurgical 
decompression is enough to relieve symptoms in the long 
term, and have compared this procedure to performing 
posterior lumbar fusion.10,13,17 This has led to a significant 
increase in the rates of fusion procedures performed after 
decompression procedures, and has raised some concern 
about overuse of this technology to support degenerative 
spinal segments.7 Modhia et al.14 showed readmission rates 
of 8%–10% per year after failed microsurgical decom-
pression resulting in either conversion to fusion, revision 
decompression, or injections. Furthermore, of those pa-
tients who were not readmitted, > 25% received injections 
for pain management within the first quarter and 20% re-
ceived injections in the second quarter postoperatively.11 
Similarly, the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial 
(SPORT) reported reoperation rates ranging from 8% at 2 
years to 13% at 4 years in the patients who underwent de-
compression.22 Recently, Ghogawala et al.8 prospectively 
studied patients with stable spondylolisthesis and found a 
cumulative reoperation rate of 34% in the decompression 
alone (DA) group.
In addition to the complex presentation of degenerative 
lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS), validated patient-reported 
outcomes (PROs) may not adequately reflect short-term 
and long-term intended clinical benefit from a single out-
come measure.1 The PROs are known to be affected by 
psychosocial covariates and the psychometric properties 
of the tests themselves.23 Regardless of treatment, the pri-
mary end point goal of spinal stenosis surgery is to pro-
duce a sustainable treatment outcome without requiring 
reoperations or further epidural interventions.9 The ra-
tionale for including epidural interventions as a criterion 
of the primary end point signifies a definitive, empirical 
measure of insufficient decompression at the time of sur-
gery or progression of the degeneration, causing recur-
rence. Either way, the surgery failed to provide sustained 
pain relief. When assessing clinical success for a spinal 
stenosis diagnosis, PROs focused on quantifying back and 
leg pain, function, and satisfaction as, in addition to their 
neurological function, freedom from pain medication, and 
ability to walk incrementally describe the patient’s overall 
clinical success. Therefore, most spine clinical trials per-
formed in the US as part of an approval process through 
the FDA use a composite clinical success (CCS) score that 
is a combination of multiple safety and efficacy end points 
to describe both safety and efficacy comprehensively.
The objective of this report was to present the results of 
a 2-year prospective, randomized, multicenter study com-
paring open microsurgical DA with open microsurgical 
decompression with interlaminar stabilization (D+ILS) 
in patients with moderate to severe LSS with or without 
spondylolisthesis at 1 or 2 contiguous levels between L-3 
and L-5.
Methods
Study Design
Patients underwent surgery between March 2008 and 
July 2014 at 1 of 7 sites throughout Germany, with ap-
proval of the institutional ethics committee. The planned 
randomization was a 1:1 ratio for a total of 230 patients 
(115 investigational and 115 control). The control group 
was open microsurgical DA, and the investigational group 
consisted of patients who underwent open microsurgical 
D+ILS, using the coflex device (Paradigm Spine). Each 
center received a batch of sealed, numbered, randomiza-
tion envelopes, and neither patients nor surgeons knew 
the study treatment until time of surgery. This study was 
registered with the ClinicalTrials.gov database (http://
clinicaltrials.gov), and its registration no. is NCT01316211. 
All patients had a minimum of 3 months of conservative 
therapy without improvement of symptoms, and required 
open microsurgical decompression for treatment of mod-
erate to severe LSS. Screening for the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria was performed prior to enrollment (Table 1).
Briefly, the major inclusion criteria were age > 40 years, 
visual analog scale (VAS) back pain score of ≥ 50 mm, 
and radiographic confirmation of clinical symptoms of at 
least moderate degenerative spinal stenosis, with constric-
tion of the central spinal canal in 1 or 2 adjacent segments 
from L-3 to L-5 with the need for decompression. In ad-
dition, the following was allowed but not required: hyper-
trophy of the facet joints and subarticular recess stenosis 
in the relevant segment or stenosis of the foramen in the 
relevant segment, and/or spondylolisthesis (anterolisthesis 
or retrolisthesis) up to grade I verified by flexion-extension 
radiographic films. The main exclusion criteria were ra-
diographic confirmation of translational instability in the 
main segment as well as in adjacent segments (dynamic 
translational instability ≤ 3 mm), previous surgery at index 
level, and/or vertebral or pars fracture.
Data Analysis
Analyses were performed using a modified intent-to-
treat analysis set that included a total of 110 patients with 
D+ILS and 115 patients with DA. There were 264 patients 
screened and 254 were randomized. Of these, 250 had a 
complete surgical case report form with baseline data suf-
ficient for inclusion in the modified intent-to-treat analysis 
set and subsequent data collection and analysis. Four pa-
tients did not have a complete case report form at the time 
of enrollment, due to loss after randomization, not meet-
ing inclusion/exclusion criteria, or other factors.

The sample size and power were estimated a priori. For 
N = 115 per arm with 1:1 randomization, the power of t-
tests to test superiority for a continuous variable such as 
the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) with a significance 
level of p < 0.025 (a = 2.5%, 1-sided, superiority) is 85%, 
assuming a medium effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.4) and a loss 
to follow-up rate of approximately 13% over 24 months. 
In addition to hypothesis testing for individual continuous 
and discrete outcome measures, superiority testing was 
undertaken for CCS, a binary composite measure. Statisti-
cal software packages SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.) 
and R version 3.4.2 (R Core Team [2017], R Foundation 
for Statistical Computing) were used.
Device Description
The coflex is an ILS device that is implanted between 
the lamina of adjacent vertebrae. The component is a U 
shape fabricated from titanium-aluminum-vanadium al-
loy (Fig. 1). The U is positioned horizontally, with its apex 
oriented anteriorly and the 2 long arms of the U paral-
leling the long axis of the spinal processes. The bone-
facing surfaces produce an interference fit between the 
lamina and are ridged to provide resistance to migration. 
A set of 2 wings extends vertically from the superior long 
arm of the U, with a second set of wings extending below 
the inferior long arm. Both sets of wings have serrated 
bone-facing surfaces, which are designed to further sta-
bilize the coflex device to the superior and inferior spi-
nous processes. The device protects the decompression 
by unloading the facets, maintaining index-level range 
of motion, and preserving postdecompression foraminal 
height (FH). In the US jurisdiction, the device is indi-
cated for use in 1- or 2-level lumbar stenosis from L-1 to 
L-5 in skeletally mature patients with at least moderate 
impairment in function, with or without back pain, and 
who have undergone at least 6 months of nonoperative 
treatment. The coflex is intended to be implanted midline 
between adjacent lamina of 1 or 2 contiguous lumbar mo-
tion segments. In part, the contraindications include prior 
fusion or decompressive laminectomy at the index level, 
compressive fracture, severe facet hypertrophy requiring 
extensive bone removal possibly creating instability, ≥ 
grade II spondylolisthesis, degenerative lumbar scolio-
sis with a Cobb angle > 25°, osteoporosis, and idiopathic 
back or leg pain.
Surgical Technique 
In both arms of the study, surgical management began 
identically. General anesthesia was induced, and patients 
were placed prone with appropriate positioning pre-
cautions. Using a standard midline incision, an open or 
mini-open surgical exposure was performed with typical 
technique, and confirmation of operative levels was final-
ized. For decompression, a standard microsurgical tech-

nique was used. The supraspinous ligament was either 
resected or retracted laterally for later repair. Depending 
on the pathological features, partial medial facetectomies, 
laminotomies or laminectomies, and/or formal forami-
notomies were undertaken as needed. In all cases, care 
was taken to preserve 50% of the bilateral facet joints and 
the entirety of the bilateral pars interarticularis to ensure 
stability. For the cases treated with coflex ILS devices, 
care was also taken to retain an appropriate portion of the 
cephalad and caudal lamina and spinous processes to al-
low for device purchase. Trials were then performed by 
inserting the coflex into the interlaminar space to confirm 
correct sizing—under fluoroscopic imaging, the device 
was introduced into the interlaminar space. After final 
placement, the wings were gently crimped. Fluoroscop-
ic imaging in the anterior-posterior and lateral views was 
performed to confirm positioning. Standard layered clo-
sure was performed in both groups.
Radiographic Outcome Measures 
Radiographic imaging was obtained at each time point. 
Imaging was performed at the individual sites and sub-
sequently subjected to analyses by an independent core 
radiographic laboratory (Medical Metrics Inc.). Radio-
graphic analyses focused on changes in FH and posterior 
disc height (DH) from preoperative values. 
Clinical Outcome Measures
Patients were assessed preoperatively and at 3, 12, and 
24 months postoperatively. Physical examination, assess-
ment of narcotic usage, and neurological assessment were 
performed at each visit by the surgeon. Validated clinical 
outcomes were administered by patient self-assessment 
questionnaires that included the Zürich Claudication 
Questionnaire (ZCQ), VAS for back and leg pain, and the 
ODI. A Walking Distance Test (WDT) and radiographic 
evaluation were performed.
Time to secondary surgical intervention (SSI) and/or 
lumbar injection (LI) for pain was assessed using survival 
analysis methods. Criteria for SSI included removal, revi-
sion, or replacement of the study device or reoperation due 
to treatment failure. To provide a conservative assessment 
of complication relatedness, adverse events (AEs) were de-
fined as related if they were assessed as either definitely 
or probably related to the implant or if the AE had a chart 
note indicating that it was procedure related.
Walking Distance Test
A validated treadmill-administered WDT was used to 
assess functional status4—a patient would walk (0° ramp 
incline at a speed of 1.8 km/hr) for 15 minutes (450 m) 
or until severe symptoms occurred. Clinical success was 
indicated by either ≥ 8-minute improvement or the ability 
to walk to the maximum 15-minute limit.
Patient-Reported Outcomes
For the analysis of data, assessments only up to the 
time of the SSI or LI were included to avoid confounding 
good clinical status due to the successful secondary treat-
ment after a failed primary treatment.
Oswestry Disability Index. The ODI is a validated 
questionnaire developed by Fairbank6 that is used to as-
sess the degree of disability and the quality of life of a pa-
tient suffering from low-back pain. A validated German-
language version of the ODI was used in which 1 question 
had been removed, comprising a 9-question instrument. 
The translated instrument was rescaled as 0 to 100 by di-
viding the sum score by 45, and an improvement of 15 
points from baseline evaluated on a per-patient basis was 
deemed a success. The mean improvement and the per-
centage of patients achieving success (improvement > 15 
points) were calculated at each time point.
Zürich Claudication Questionnaire. The ZCQ was 
developed by Stucki et al.21 as a quality of life index for 
patients with LSS, and it contains questions related to 3 
distinct theoretical constructs: symptom severity (SS), 
physical function (PF), and patient satisfaction (PS). The 
SS domain is composed of 7 questions scored on a scale of 
1–5; the PF scale is composed of 5 questions scored on a 
scale from 1 to 4; and the PS scale is composed of 6 ques-
tions also scored on a scale from 1 to 4. Success in 2 or 3 
ZCQ criteria was considered success.
Visual Analog Scale Score. For the analysis of VAS 
leg and VAS back, a decrease of at least 20 mm on VAS 
has been shown to correspond to a minimal clinically im-
portant difference and is often used for related pain assess-
ments. For this study, VAS clinical success was defined as 
a > 20-mm change from baseline. When evaluating VAS 
leg pain, separate assessments on the right and left legs 
were combined by evaluating whether either leg achieved 
at least a 20-mm improvement from baseline.

Composite Clinical Success
As the decision to treat a patient is multifactorial, the 
assessment of success must comprehensively account 
for the components of spinal stenosis as well. The CCS 
is a binary outcome measure in which all 4 components 
must be achieved: 1) ODI success with improvement > 15 
points; 2) survivorship with no SSIs or LIs; 3) neurological 
maintenance or improvement without worsening; and 4) 
no device- or procedure-related severe AEs (DPR SAEs). 
The CCS is a strict outcome measure validated in a major 
US FDA pivotal randomized controlled trial of the coflex 
device. It was the primary outcome measure resulting in 
regulatory approval. Results have been reported in peer-
reviewed publications at 2-year and 5-year follow-up.3,16
Results
Demographic and Baseline Data
Overall demographic and intraoperative measure-
ments showed no statistically significant differences be-
tween treatment groups (Table 2). One patient in the ef-
fectiveness analysis set was missing baseline data. The 
number of levels treated was not significantly different 
between groups (D+ILS: 74 single, 36 multiple; DA: 
76 single, 39 multiple; p = 0.84). The rate of spondylo-
listhesis was not significantly different (D+ILS: 22.1%; 
DA: 22.0%; p = 0.986). The baseline scores for back pain 
(D+ILS: 64.7 ± 21.1; DA: 65.4 ± 19.6; p = 0.788); left leg 
pain (D+ILS: 50.4 ± 28.0; DA: 45.3 ± 30.6; p = 0.196); 
and right leg pain (D+ILS: 46.2 ± 31.9; DA: 42.8 ± 29.7; p 
= 0.411) were not significantly different. The rate of cen-
tral stenosis, central plus foraminal stenosis, central plus 
lateral recess stenosis, and central plus both foraminal 
and lateral recess stenosis was not significantly different 
between groups (p = 0.747).
Patient Follow-Up
The analysis set consisted of 225 patients (110 D+ILS, 
115 DA). There was 1 unrelated patient death in the 
D+ILS group. At 24 months, 101 of 109 (92.7%) remain-
ing patients in the D+ILS group and 103 of 115 (89.6%) in 
the DA group were evaluable for analysis, representing an 
overall 91% follow-up rate. Major safety and efficacy end 
points are synopsized in Table 3.
ODI Values
Baseline ODI values for the 2 treatment groups were 
not different (D+ILS: 53.7 ± 9.7; DA: 53.3 ± 10.3; p = 
0.74). The a priori study end point of ODI at 24 months 
when uncensored for subsequent secondary intervention 
showed no statistical difference between groups (D+ILS: 
24.8 ± 16.5; DA: 28.0 ± 19.8; p = 0.22). At 24 months, 
among patients with no secondary intervention, there was 
no difference between the treatment groups (D+ILS: 22.8 
± 15.9; DA: 24.6 ± 18.8; p = 0.51) (Fig. 2). At 24 months, 
among patients with no secondary intervention, a higher 
percentage of patients in the D+ILS group achieved ODI 
success with improvement > 15 points (D+ILS: 75.6%;

DA: 70.4%; p = 0.47)—however, the results were not sta-
tistically different.
ZCQ Success
Among patients with no secondary intervention, 80.2% 
in the D+ILS and 81.7% in the DA group achieved success 
criteria in at least 2 of the 3 ZCQ component scores. The 
group difference was not statistically significant between 
treatments (p = 0.82) at month 24. Within each component 
of the ZCQ (SS, PF, and PS), there was not a statistically 
significant difference between treatment groups at any 
time postoperatively.
VAS Back Pain
Among patients with no secondary intervention, 69.5% in 
the D+ILS and 74.6% in the DA group reported at least a 20-
mm improvement from baseline to month 24 in back pain 
VAS (p = 0.48). Regardless of treatment, patients showed 
statistically significant improvements from baseline at all 
time points out to 24 months; however, there was no differ-
ence between treatments at any of the time points (Fig. 2).
VAS Leg Pain
Regardless of treatment, patients showed statistically 
significant differences from baseline at all time points out 
to 24 months; however there was no difference between 
treatments at any of the time points (Fig. 2). Among pa-
tients with no secondary intervention, 85.4% who un-
derwent D+ILS and 76.1% who received DA (p = 0.14) 
reported at least a 20-mm improvement in leg pain from 
baseline to month 24.
Secondary Intervention
Surgical Intervention
For D+ILS, 14/110 (12.7%) patients had an SSI. Similar-
ly, for DA, 17/115 (14.8%) had an SSI. For D+ILS, Kaplan-
Meier estimates of 1- and 2-year survival without SSI were 
87.7% (95% CI 81.6%–94.2%) and 86.7% (95% CI 80.4%–
93.4%), respectively. For DA, 1- and 2-year survival es-
timates without SSI were 87.0% (95% CI 80.9%–93.6%) 
and 84.1% (95% CI 77.4%–91.3%), respectively. Although 
survival without SSI was numerically higher at 1 and 2 
years for D+ILS compared with DA, the group difference 
was not statistically significant (log-rank test, p = 0.72).
Epidural Steroid Injections
Among patients with D+ILS, 5/110 (4.5%) had an LI. 
For those treated with DA, 17/115 (14.8%) had an LI at up 
to 2 years, and 2 additional patients in the DA group were 
treated with LI after month 24. No patient had an SSI prior 
to an LI. Three patients in the DA group had an SSI after 
receiving LI treatment. The group difference in time to 
LI was highly statistically significant (p = 0.0065), with 
patients in the DA group receiving treatment sooner. The 
survival curve differences appeared early. At 3 months 
the Kaplan-Meier estimates for being injection free were 
99.0% (95% CI 96.9%–100%) and 93.5% (95% CI 88.9%–
98.3%) for D+ILS and DA, respectively, whereas at 1 
year these values were 96.8% (95% CI 93.2%–100%) and 
84.4% (95% CI 77.6%–91.7%), a difference of > 12%.
Times From Index Surgery to Secondary Intervention
The Kaplan-Meier estimates for freedom from any 
secondary intervention including either SSI or LI were 
84.9% (95% CI 78.3%–92.0%) at year 1 and 81.9% (95% 
CI 74.8%–89.6%) at year 2 for D+ILS; and the estimates 
were 74.1% (95% CI 66.3%–82.9%) at year 1 and 71.2% 
(95% CI 63.1%–80.3%) at year 2 for DA. The Kaplan-Mei-
er survival curves for times to first secondary intervention 
using all available follow-up data are compared in Fig. 3. 
The log-rank p value for the group difference is p = 0.069.

controlling for age, body mass index (BMI), baseline ODI, 
and sex, the risk of secondary intervention was 1.75 (95% 
CI 0.99–3.09) times higher among patients in the DA com-
pared with those in the D+ILS group (p = 0.055).
Narcotic Use
Preoperatively, there was no statistically significant dif-
ference between patient groups. At every time point, from 
postsurgery through month 24, a lower percentage of pa-
tients in the D+ILS group reported use of opioid medication. 
At month 24, 16.7% of the D+ILS and 23% of the DA group 
(p = 0.29) remained on opioid medication (Table 4). The 
compensatory effect of narcotics usage was analyzed with 
respect to VAS leg pain change from preoperative baseline. 
Within the D+ILS group at month 24, there was no statisti-
cally significant difference between patients taking narcot-
ics and those not taking narcotics (VAS leg pain score for 
D+ILS with narcotics: 31.0 ± 32.3; score for D+ILS without 
narcotics: 23.7 ± 26.3; p = 0.43). In comparison, for the DA 
group at month 24 there was a statistically significant dif-
ference between patients taking narcotics compared with 
those not taking narcotics (VAS leg pain score for DA with 
narcotics: 42.7 ± 32.5; score for DA without narcotics: 16.9 
± 23.8; p < 0.01). Furthermore, in the DA with narcotics 
group, the change from baseline to month 24 decreased ini-
tially (at month 3), but increased from month 6 to month 
24 to past the original baseline level. Comparatively, both 
D+ILS groups and the DA group without narcotics showed 
sustained significant decreases, from 20 to 40 points from 
baseline pain levels, at all postoperative time points.
WDT Success
There was no statistical difference in the preoperative 
median scores (D+ILS: 1.55 minutes; DA: 1.75 minutes; 
p = 0.45). Among patients with no secondary intervention, 
73.0% in the D+ILS and 73.3% in the DA group (p = 0.96) 
achieved the WDT success criterion of either an improve-
ment of at least 8 minutes or being able to walk the maxi-
mum of 15 minutes. However, the comparison between 
treatments is significantly different when comparing the 
median change from baseline; D+ILS is > 2 times the im-
provement of DA and > 5 times the improvement from base-
line, compared with 2 times the improvement from baseline 
for DA. There were statistically significant differences be-
tween treatments in median improvements at month 3 (p = 
0.004), month 12 (p = 0.008), and trending at month 24 (p = 
0.06) when comparing the change from baseline (Fig. 4).
Neurological Success
Neurological success was defined as no new or wors-
ening persistent neurological deficit in sensory, motor, or 
reflex function, or Laségue test (straight leg raise). At 24 
months, overall neurological success was achieved in 91.7% 
of patients in the D+ILS versus 89.0% of those in the DA 
group, and the difference was not statistically significant 
(p = 0.53). There was also no difference in any of the com-
ponent tests between treatments that comprised the over-

all neurological success. At month 24, when neurological 
success and freedom from narcotics are combined with no 
secondary interventions and ODI success, clinical success 
is achieved in 55.4% of patients in the D+ILS group com-
pared with 36.3% in the DA group (p = 0.006), resulting in 
an effectiveness difference of 19.2% (95% CI 5.7%–32.6%).
Composite Clinical Success
The CCS was calculated as a binary outcome measure. 
All 4 components must be achieved: 1) ODI success with 
improvement > 15 points; 2) survivorship with no SSIs or 
LIs; 3) neurological maintenance or improvement without 
worsening; and 4) no DPR SAEs. The rate of CCS was 
significantly superior in the stabilization group (58.4% 
D+ILS vs 41.7% DA; p = 0.017).
Radiographic Findings
The change in FH for D+ILS from baseline to 24 
months showed a slight decrease of 0.11 ± 0.78 mm, which 
was not statistically different (p = 0.16). In comparison, 
the DA group sustained a statistically significant loss of 
FH at all time points postoperatively, with a decrease of 
0.74 ± 1.08 mm at month 24 (p < 0.001). The difference in 
the change in FH was statistically significantly different 
between treatment groups at month 3 (p = 0.028), month 
12 (p = 0.010), and month 24 (p < 0.001) (Fig. 5).
The preoperative DH was not significantly differ-
ent (D+ILS: 4.94 ± 1.75 mm; DA: 4.99 ± 1.83 mm; p = 
0.82). There was statistically significantly more loss in DH 
at month 12 (p = 0.041) and month 24 (p < 0.001) from 
preoperative values in the DA group compared with the 
D+ILS group. The DA group had a 3 times greater loss 
(−0.72 ± 1.04 mm) than the D+ILS group (−0.22 ± 0.76 
mm) at month 24; however, both were statistically differ-
ent from the preoperative heights (p < 0.001 and p = 0.006 
for DA and D+ILS, respectively) (Fig. 5).
Adverse Events
The percentages of patients with any AEs were 71.8% 
(79/110) and 70.4% (81/115) for D+ILS and DA groups, re-
spectively (c2 = 0.82). Twenty-five of 110 (22.7%) patients 
who underwent D+ILS and 26 of 115 (22.6%) who had 
DA experienced an AE that was classified as related to the 
surgical procedure or the device (p = 0.98). There were no 
DPR SAEs involving device failure or migration in the ex-
perimental arm. Dural violations were reported in 5 (4.5%) 
patients in the D+ILS group and in 15 (13.0%) patients in 
the DA group. The risk of dural violation was significantly 
higher (c2 = 0.025) in the DA group.
Discussion
Spinal stenosis is a multifactorial degenerative process, 
and an accurate clinical picture includes a broad analy-
sis of clinically evaluated debilitation, patient assessment, 
and anatomical changes. Most surgeons agree that open, 
visualized, microsurgical decompression significantly 
improves symptoms in patients with moderate to severe 
claudication of spinal stenosis. However, the underlying 
pathology of significantly degenerated facets and subar-
ticular disease remains.
The results of the study did not show statistically sig-
nificant differences of individual patient-reported data in 
the 2 treatment groups among those who met the survival

end point. The ODI group mean improvement primary end 
point, which included all patients and was not screened for 
SSIs or LIs, did not show a significant difference between 
treatments. Of particular note, VAS back outcomes did 
not show a difference because this was an expected treat-
ment difference in the original study design. In contrast, 
the CCS was significantly superior for the ILS group, tak-
ing into account multiple validated safety and efficacy end 
points, despite the lack of difference for individual PROs. 
Significantly more patients in the DA group received an LI 
compared with those in the D+ILS group. Furthermore, 
this study revealed a significantly greater improvement in 
walking distance for the D+ILS than for the DA patient 
cohort, a > 2-fold difference. Radiographically, the com-
pensatory progression of the underlying pathology was ev-
ident in both treatments; however, ILS was able to sustain 
the FH statistically significantly higher and longer than in 
the DA group. The dural tear rate was > 2 times higher 
in the DA group, a rate consistent with that of other stud-
ies,7,8,18,23 and possibly resulting from small differences in 
surgical technique due to the surgeon’s knowledge that the 
device will maintain the established decompression.
Regarding the use of CCS as an end point, most recent 
spine clinical trials have used such a multiple-components 
statistical analysis.1,3,16 As described by Wertli et al.,23 
clinical interpretation bias can occur when viewing results 
by a single measure, because single end points do not al-
ways provide a contextually relevant viewpoint. In patients 
meeting the survival end point, an overall analysis was 
performed to be inclusive of all the factors contributing to 
the clinical complexity of spinal stenosis and its surgical 
treatment, including both safety and efficacy. Therefore, 
to meet the CCS criteria, a patient must survive without 
SSI or LI, must have a clinically important improvement in 
ODI score, and must have no neurological deterioration or 
DPR SAEs. This is a stringent clinical criterion applied to 
both the experimental and control arms, having previously 
been validated in a US FDA pivotal trial.
Although there have been previously reported studies 
involving coflex, this is the first level 1 study directly as-
sessing the outcome difference of adding an ILS device 
postdecompression compared with DA. Röder et al.19 not-
ed significant benefit with coflex stabilization after decom-
pression in a matched-pair cohort comparison study from 
the Swiss Spine Registry and the European Spine Tango 
database. Kumar et al.12 reported statistically significant 
improvement with open microsurgical decompression for 
spinal stenosis and statistically significant improvement 
when coflex ILS was added to the decompression. Fur-
thermore, although not comparing the procedure with ILS, 
Budithi et al.2 demonstrated the importance of evaluating 
walking distance in patients with spinal stenosis undergo-
ing decompression surgery. Combining these experiences 
with the level 1 data of the investigational device exemp-
tion study findings,1,3,16 there is evidence that ILS surgery 
has a valid place in the treatment of spinal stenosis.
Historically, interspinous distraction devices were de-
veloped as a potential alternative to decompression proce-
dures. The literature has demonstrated that one cannot ask 
a device to do the job of a surgery with sustainable or du-
rable outcomes. Moojen et al.15 studied DA compared with 
ILS device insertion without a concomitant decompres-
sion and validated the need for a decompression procedure 
as an essential requirement of any LSS surgical treatment 
option. Richter et al.18 showed no difference at 24 months 
between D+ILS and DA in mean outcomes; however, the 
relative individual patient outcomes were not reported. In 
addition, significant limitations of the study were selection 
bias, resulting in clinically meaningful differences in ODI 
baseline scores; the nonrandomized nature of their results; 
and the surgeons’ determination of treatment choice (de-
vice insertion or not) intraoperatively.
This study has several limitations. Despite being a ran-
domized clinical trial, imperfections in its conduct mean 
that some patients were lost to follow-up and there were 
some missing data. Despite these unavoidable challenges, 
the overall follow-up rate was satisfactory for a spinal 
surgical trial. Also, any randomized trial that is industry 
sponsored raises the question of bias, even if the bias is un-
intentional. However, this possibility was mitigated in the 
trial design by focusing on empirical and objective mea-
sures (e.g., radiographic parameters, walking distance) as 
well as PROs that are not subject to reporter bias.
Conclusions
Our study showed no significance of the individual 
PROs (e.g., ODI, VAS, ZCQ) between the treatments 
when viewed in isolation. However, the CCS, an end point 
validated in a US FDA pivotal trial that combines 4 safety 
and efficacy end points, is statistically superior for ILS. 
The DA arm had 228% more LIs and had a numerically 
higher rate of narcotic use at every time point postsurgi-
cally. Microsurgical D+ILS increases walking tolerance, 
decreases compensatory pain management, and maintains 
radiographic FH, extending the durability and sustainabil-
ity of a decompression procedure.
