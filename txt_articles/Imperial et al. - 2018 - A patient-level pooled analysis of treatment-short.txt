hree recent international randomized phase 3 trials evaluating 
4-month fluoroquinolone-containing regimens in adults with 
pulmonary, drug-susceptible tuberculosis failed to achieve 
non-inferiority compared with the standard 6-month control 
regimen (OFLOTUB1, ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00216385; 
REMoxTB2, ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00864383; RIFAQUIN3, 
ISRCTN number 44153044). These trials evaluated later-generation 
fluoroquinolones (gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin) as single substitu-
tions for ethambutol or isoniazid in multidrug regimens with the 
objective of shortening treatment duration from 6 to 4 months. In 
each of the three trials, the 4-month regimen did not satisfy the 
criteria for non-inferiority. However, the experimental 4-month 
regimens did cure approximately four-fifths of the participants, sug-
gesting that a large proportion of global tuberculosis cases could be 
successfully treated with shorter duration1–3.
Since the introduction of highly effective rifampin-based regi-
mens in the 1970s and 1980s, the treatment of tuberculosis has been 
a ‘one-size-fits-all’ paradigm, with a 6-month regimen composed 
of four drugs (isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol) 
used for all patients with drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculo-
sis4,5. Regimen administration is coupled with various adherence 
interventions at the programmatic level, including directly observed 
therapy, to ensure regimen intake4. In programs, the one-size-fits-all 
paradigm leads to undertreatment of patients with severe forms of 
disease and entails unnecessarily long treatment with potential tox-
icities for many patients in whom there is a lower disease burden, 
which in turn may result in increased rates of loss to follow-up6. 
In clinical trials, one-size-fits-all experimental regimens have been 
consistently inadequate to cure the hardest-to-treat tuberculosis 
patients, indicating that treatment duration is a critical determi-
nant for cure7. Moreover, even for the standard 6-month regimen, 
the recent trials demonstrate that 5–8% of patients fail treatment or 
relapse and 15–20% experience composite unfavorable outcomes1–3,8. 
Tuberculosis is not a uniform clinical entity; it presents with wide 
variation in severity of disease at the time of diagnosis. Yet current 
tuberculosis regimen development efforts are aimed at using new 
drugs with increased potency to identify shorter treatments for all 
patients, regardless of severity of disease. This approach places oth-
erwise efficacious drugs and regimens at risk of being abandoned, 
consequently impeding the identification of new tuberculosis regi-
mens that would be curative if used with greater precision.
In this pooled analysis of individual participant datasets from 
these high-quality, contemporary trials, we sought to identify char-
acteristics of those participants who were cured with 4-month 
regimens and, conversely, of those with hard-to-treat phenotypes 
of tuberculosis, who might require longer treatment durations. We 
evaluated both baseline characteristics and on-treatment markers of 
risk, including dosing frequency and adherence, for their ability to 
stratify the study population into easy- or hard-to-treat phenotypes 
of tuberculosis.
Results

Tuberculosis kills more people than any other infectious disease. Three pivotal trials testing 4-month regimens failed to meet 
non-inferiority margins; however, approximately four-fifths of participants were cured. Through a pooled analysis of patient-
level data with external validation, we identify populations eligible for 4-month treatment, define phenotypes that are hard 
to treat and evaluate the impact of adherence and dosing strategy on outcomes. In 3,405 participants included in analyses, 
baseline smear grade of 3+ 
 relative to < 
2+ 
, HIV seropositivity and adherence of ≤ 
90% were significant risk factors for unfa-
vorable outcome. Four-month regimens were non-inferior in participants with minimal disease defined by < 
2+ 
 sputum smear 
grade or non-cavitary disease. A hard-to-treat phenotype, defined by high smear grades and cavitation, may require durations 
> 
6 months to cure all. Regimen duration can be selected in order to improve outcomes, providing a stratified medicine approach 
as an alternative to the ‘one-size-fits-all’ treatment currently used worldwide.

analyses of the OFLOTUB1, REMoxTB2, and RIFAQUIN3 trials; 6 
participants were excluded from the current analyses due to inabil-
ity to verify treatment allocation in source databases. The external 
validation dataset (DMID 01-009; see ref. 9) includes 193 study par-
ticipants treated with a 4-month experimental regimen (no fluo-
roquinolone) and 193 study participants treated with the standard 
6-month regimen (Fig. 1). Baseline characteristics of participants 
did not differ across the experimental and control groups within 
analysis datasets, with the exception of race and enrollment at sites 
in the country of Senegal (both P < 0.001; Table 1); 12% of the par-
ticipants were infected with HIV.
Primary outcome analysis. Multivariate Cox analysis of baseline 
risk factors for unfavorable outcomes included 3,154 of 3,405 par-
ticipants (93%) with no missing baseline covariates; 1,843 of 2,001 
participants (92%) were allocated to one of the 4-month experimen-
tal regimens, and 1,311 of 1,404 participants (93%) were allocated 
to the control regimens (Supplementary Tables 1–3). In partici-
pants assigned to 4-month experimental regimens, baseline smear 
grade of 3+ 
 relative to negative or 1+ 
 grade and HIV seropositiv-
ity were the two major baseline clinical risk factors for unfavorable 
outcomes, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.4 (95% confi-
dence interval (CI), 1.1–1.9) and 1.4 (95% CI, 1.1–1.9), respectively,

adjusted also for age and sex. Higher risk was observed in older par-
ticipants (adjusted HR, 1.1 per 10 years increase; 95% CI, 1.0–1.2) 
and male participants (HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.3–2.1). After inclusion of 
on-treatment culture and adherence as risk factors, 1,668 of 2,001 
experimental arm participants (83%) were available for analysis. 
Non-adherence was the most significant risk factor for unfavorable 
outcome, with adjusted HRs of 5.7 (95% CI, 3.3–9.9) for partici-
pants who missed 10% or more prescribed doses and 1.4 (95% CI, 
1.0–1.9) for participants who missed less than 10% of prescribed 
doses relative to participants who completed treatment without any 
missed doses. Month 2 culture positivity was significantly associ-
ated with unfavorable outcome (HR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.7–2.9). After 
adjustment for on-treatment factors, lower body mass index (BMI, 
representative of malnutrition) was a risk factor for unfavorable 
outcome (HR, 1.4 per 5 kg m−2 decrease; 95% CI, 1.1–1.7) (Fig. 2a 
and Supplementary Table 4).
In the 1,311 of 1,404 participants (93%) allocated to the 6-month 
control regimen, HIV seropositivity was the most significant base-
line risk factor for unfavorable outcomes, with an adjusted HR of 2.3 
(95% CI, 1.6–3.3). Participants who were older (HR, 1.3 per 10 years 
increase; 95% CI, 1.1–1.4), were male (HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1–2.1) or 
had lower BMI at study entry (HR, 1.3 per 5 kg m−2 decrease; 95% 
CI, 1.0–1.7) had higher risk of unfavorable outcomes. Of control-
arm participants, 1,186 of 1404 (84%) contributed data both for 
baseline and on-treatment risk factors. Non-adherence was the 
most significant on-treatment risk factor for unfavorable outcomes, 
with adjusted HR of 5.9 (95% CI, 3.3–10.5) for participants who 
missed 10% or more and 2.4 (95% CI, 1.6–3.6) for participants who 
missed less than 10% of prescribed doses relative to participants 
who completed treatment without any missed doses. On-treatment 
culture positivity was also identified as a significant risk factor for 
unfavorable outcomes (month 2 HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3–2.7). After 
adjustment for on-treatment factors, HIV positivity (HR, 3.1; 95% 
CI, 2.0–4.6), male sex (HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.0–2.4), and lower BMI 
(HR, 1.5 per 5 kg m−2 decrease; 95% CI, 1.0–2.0) remained as fac-
tors associated with high risk (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 5). 
In the per-protocol analysis, results were similar in the experimen-
tal and control groups when compared with the primary modified 
intent-to-treat analysis (Supplementary Table 6).
Non-inferiority test. The percentage of unfavorable outcomes 
at 24 months for study participants with a baseline negative or 1+ 
grade smear was similar in experimental and control regimens, 
indicating non-inferiority (difference in study adjusted Kaplan–
Meier estimate of unfavorable outcome, 2.6; 90% CI, − 
0.4 to 5.6; 
P = 
 0.05 for interaction). Additionally, study participants with non-
cavitary disease had a similar percentage of unfavorable outcomes 
between experimental and control regimens (difference in study 
adjusted Kaplan–Meier estimate of unfavorable outcome, 3.1; 90% 
CI, 0.9–5.4; P = 
 0.06 for interaction). In an easy-to-treat phenotype 
of tuberculosis consisting of participants with 1+ or negative smear 
or non-cavitary disease that constituted 47% of the study population 
(1,591 of 3,405 participants), the 4-month regimens were non-infe-
rior to the 6-month control regimen (Fig. 3a). In a hard-to-treat phe-
notype of tuberculosis consisting of participants with 3+ smear and 
cavitary disease that constituted 34% of the study population (1,162 
of 3,405 participants), the 4-month regimens were clearly inferior.
External validation. Using an independent dataset available from 
the DMID 01-009 trial in patients with non-cavitary disease, the 
patient population eligible for a 4-month rifampin-containing 
 
regimen was validated, confirming that for study participants with 
low to moderate smear grade, a standard regimen shortened to 
4 months was non-inferior to the standard 6-month regimen. We 
confirmed that study participants with high smear grade were the 
driver of high rates of unfavorable outcomes in the 4-month DMID 
01-009 regimen (Fig. 3b).
Impact of dosing frequency. Kaplan–Meier estimates show that 
study participants who fully adhered to a dosing regimen of 6 of 
7 days per week (6/7) had a higher probability of unfavorable out-
come than those who adhered to and completed a dosing regimen 
of 7 of 7 days per week (7/7) (HR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.1–6.7, after adjust-
ment for treatment duration and country) (Fig. 4a).
To assess the impact of partial adherence on standard of care 
under a 7/7 or 6/7 dosing strategy, 1,285 participants who com-
pleted at minimum 4 months of treatment (112 total doses) were 
included in the Cox regression analysis. This analysis set included 
687 participants who were prescribed treatment with a 7/7 weekly 
dosing strategy for 26 weeks (REMoxTB and RIFAQUIN trials) and 
598 participants who were prescribed treatment with a 6/7 weekly 
dosing strategy for 24 weeks (OFLOTUB trial). On a 7/7 weekly 
dosing strategy for 26 weeks, participants who took 156 to 181 total 
doses (corresponding to an average of 6 doses per week, or missing 
up to 14% pills) or 112 to 155 total doses (corresponding to an aver-
age of 5 doses per week, or missing 14–33% pills) had significantly 
higher risk of unfavorable outcomes relative to those who took all 
182 prescribed doses (7 doses per week), with HRs of 2.4 (95% CI, 
1.3–4.3) and 28.9 (95% CI, 10.5–80.0), respectively, adjusted for 
treatment duration and country (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 7). 
 
Similarly, participants receiving 112 to 143 doses (average of 5 doses 
per week) had a higher risk of unfavorable outcomes relative to those 
who took the complete 144 prescribed doses (6 doses per week) for 
24 weeks, with HR of 2.4 (95% CI, 1.2–4.8), adjusted for treatment 
duration and country (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Table 7).
Discussion
In this pooled analysis of individual participant data from recent 
phase 3 treatment-shortening trials, we have shown that adult 
patients with minimal disease, as defined by low smear grade or the 
absence of cavitation, were at lower baseline risk for unfavorable 
outcomes; in this population the experimental 4-month regimens 
are effective. Patients with either of these low-risk characteristics, 
which define an easy-to-treat phenotype of tuberculosis, consti-
tuted 47% of the total study population (1,591 of 3,405 participants). 
 
Conversely, we have shown that a smear grade of 3+ 
 and the pres-
ence of cavitation on chest radiographs at baseline define a hard-to-
treat phenotype, constituting 34% of the study population (1,162 
of 3,405 participants), and this group may require longer dura-
tions of treatment than the current standard 6-month regimen to 
achieve the highest cure rates feasible. In our analyses, other base-
line characteristics associated with unfavorable outcomes included 
being HIV infected and having a lower BMI at study entry. Male sex 
was consistently and independently linked with poor likelihood of 
cure in both control and experimental regimens. The etiology for

this association is not clear, particularly given that the association 
persists after adjusting for severity of disease and adherence. Our 
definitions of tuberculosis phenotypes were validated in an inde-
pendent trial dataset of patients with non-cavitary disease. Whereas 
this trial was stopped early due to higher rates of unfavorable out-
comes in the experimental 4-month regimen, we confirmed that a 
4-month regimen would be effective for patients with negative, 1+ 
or 2+ smears in non-cavitary disease at baseline. We also confirmed 
that participants with high smear grade (3+ 
) at baseline were 
more likely to fail treatment regardless of whether they received 
4- or 6-month regimens, compared with those with lower smear 
grades at baseline. Given the established importance of cavitation 
in disease prognosis and treatment response5,10,11, we included this 
 
characteristic in the analyses of non-inferiority for various sub-
groups, despite the fact that cavitation was not a significant vari-
able in the multivariate analysis and was only marginally significant 
in the univariate analysis (Supplementary Tables 8–10). In analyses 
limited to the trials providing detailed chest radiograph readout 
data, specifically OFLOTUB and RIFAQUIN, we confirmed that 
cavity size, bilateral disease and disease extent measured by zone 
scores were all significant risk factors for unfavorable outcome 
(Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2), confirming that disease severity 
determined by chest radiograph remains an important tool for the 
definition of hard-to-treat phenotypes and prediction of treatment 
outcome. Overall, we showed that the combination of smear grad-
ing and cavitary status adequately defines easy-to-treat and hard-to-

treat groups; however, we also identified subgroups that allow for 
stratification when chest radiographic information is not available.
In this study, we also found that across both experimental and 
standard control regimens, minimal non-adherence and missed doses 
were associated with significantly increased risk for unfavorable out-
come. Missing as few as one in ten doses of a regimen was associated 
with a fivefold increase in risk. Missed doses had a stronger associa-
tion with poor outcome than did failure to achieve culture conversion 
at 2 months. Consistent with our analyses of non-adherence, dosing 
frequencies of less than 7/7 increase the chances of unfavorable out-
come, even if participants are fully adherent (Fig. 4a). Current US 
tuberculosis treatment guidelines state, on the basis of clinical experi-
ence and program practicality, that drug administration 5 days per 
week is an acceptable alternative to administration 7 days per week, 
and that either approach may be considered as meeting the definition 
of ‘daily’ dosing5. Our findings suggest otherwise and provide data-
driven evidence to support the use of 7/7 dosing12,13. The finding that 
the current rifampin-based regimen used worldwide has ‘low forgive-
ness’ for non-adherence or missed doses has important implications 
for tuberculosis care as well as for future design and conduct of clini-
cal trials. A regimen with excellent efficacy under rigorous clinical 
trial settings that is otherwise unforgiving of missed doses will fail in 
the field. New and improved adherence interventions for tuberculosis 
have been introduced to facilitate treatment completion14,15; however, 
such tools can be limited by issues of scale-up, generalizability and 
cost. A more durable and patient-centered solution is the targeted 
development of regimens composed of drugs with long half-lives and 
steady pharmacokinetic profiles that will accommodate less than per-
fect adherence patterns in the field without penalty to the efficacy of 
the regimen. Our findings in this regard highlight the critical value of 
conducting pragmatic clinical trials that assess the effectiveness and 
robustness of regimens under programmatic conditions.
In this study, we found that the 4-month fluoroquinolone-con-
taining regimens met the margin for non-inferiority in participants 
with a negative or 1+ grade baseline smear or non-cavitary disease. 
Conversely, we found that a hard-to-treat phenotype of tuberculosis 
defined by high smear grades and cavitation on baseline chest radio-
graph was associated with unfavorable outcomes. Randomized tri-
als conducted by the British Medical Research Council largely in the 
pre-HIV era have previously illustrated that the majority of patients 
do not need 6 months of standard therapy16,17. Our analyses support 
this position and suggest that the current one-size-fits-all model of 
care leads to undertreatment of patients with severe forms of disease 
and to unnecessarily long treatment (with unjustified risk of drug 
toxicity) for many patients with less extensive disease. We believe 
our results provide justification to evaluate a stratified approach to 
tuberculosis therapeutics. By using baseline markers to determine 
the optimal stratum for a given patient, with decisions for treatment 
extension further enhanced by the use of on-treatment measures 
of adherence and clinical, microbiologic and radiographic mark-
ers, the feasibility of achieving cure in all patients with tuberculosis, 
rather than a majority, is enhanced. Pursuit of the highest possible 
cure rates in tuberculosis is an important public health priority, and 
perhaps more important than treatment shortening, as suggested by 
recent modeling work that shows increases in treatment efficacy will 
have the greatest impact on reducing mortality and burden of dis-
ease worldwide18. The tools necessary for using stratified medicine 
approaches to tuberculosis care at the program level are already in use 
in many settings, including HIV testing, CD4+ cell counts for HIV-
positive patients, chest radiography, smear microscopy, and scales 
for measuring height and weight for calculation of BMI. Future trials 
that test stratified medicine approaches to tuberculosis care should 
also evaluate newer tools (for example, GeneXpert cycle threshold), 
which in turn would allow for algorithms for selecting duration to 
be further refined, offering additional characteristics and options for 
determining risk. Nonetheless, some patients will have limited access 
to these diagnostics, and in such settings, either a simpler stratifica-
tion algorithm can be developed (for example, smear grade and BMI, 
as shown in Fig. 3a) or the currently used one-size-fits-all approach 
may still remain the most practical and implementable option.
Our study has limitations. Data sharing principles are supported 
in the tuberculosis therapeutics field19,20; however, data collection

was not standardized across the included trials. Future protocols 
should use minimum dataset standards, compliant with Clinical 
Data Interchange Standards Consortium standards (https://www.
cdisc.org), to allow robust pooled analyses. Second, chest radiograph 
interpretation was not uniform, and as such, we could not analyze 
size and number of cavities in all three studies (Supplementary 
 
Figs. 1 and 2). Third, very few pharmacokinetic data were available, 
hampering our ability to explore dosing, drug exposure and outcome 
relationships. We advocate for the inclusion of population pharmaco-
kinetics in phase 3 trials to address the variability in responses across 
geographic regions and populations. Our comparison of 6/7 with 
7/7 dosing was a comparison between trials rather than within trials 
and therefore may be confounded by other study differences. Finally, 
only 12% of participants had HIV co-infection, and many were not 
on effective antiretroviral therapy regimens; thus, caution should be 
used in generalizing our findings to immunocompromised popula-
tions. Strengths of our analyses include the inclusion of large datasets 
from four international registration-quality phase 3 trials conducted 
across diverse human populations in high-tuberculosis-burden set-
tings in South America, sub-Saharan Africa and Asia; performance 
of microbiologic assays by quality-controlled laboratories; and the 
careful recording of study treatment under direct observation.
In sum, our validated analyses of individual participant data 
from contemporary randomized clinical trials provide three major 
findings. First, we show that low smear grades at baseline or the 
absence of cavitation identifies a population at low risk for recur-
rence in whom 4-month rifampin-containing regimens may be 
effective. Conversely, high sputum smear grade at baseline in con-
junction with the presence of cavities defines a hard-to-treat phe-
notype that may require longer durations of treatment than the 
current standard of care to achieve high cure rates. There is also a 
third phenotype, made up of the remaining patients for whom treat-
ment shortening may also be possible. Second, we show that minor 
degrees of non-adherence or missed doses significantly increase the 
risk for poor outcomes. Third, we show that simple baseline and on-
treatment markers could be used to select treatment duration with 
greater precision, providing a programmatically viable alternative to 
the one-size-fits-all paradigm used worldwide. Our results indicate 
that stratified medicine principles should be further evaluated in 
clinical trials of tuberculosis therapeutics.

and DMID 01-009)1–3,9 that compared 4-month regimens to standard 6-month 
regimens endorsed by the World Health Organization and the American Thoracic 
Society/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/Infectious Diseases Society 
of America for drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis4,5. The OFLOTUB trial 
compared an experimental 4-month gatifloxacin-based regimen with a 6-month 
standard regimen1. The REMoxTB trial compared two experimental 4-month 
moxifloxacin-based regimens to a 6-month standard regimen2. The RIFAQUIN 
trial compared experimental 4- or 6-month moxifloxacin- and high-dose-
rifapentine-based intermittent regimens with a 6-month standard regimen3. 
A fourth independent tuberculosis treatment-shortening trial sponsored by 
the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and conducted by the 
National Institutes of Health-funded Tuberculosis Research Unit compared a 
4-month standard regimen (with no fluoroquinolone) with a 6-month standard 
regimen in adults with non-cavitary disease and 2-month negative culture status 
(DMID 01-009; ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00130247)9. The pooled analyses 
are focused on data from participants receiving the 4-month experimental 
regimens and 6-month standard regimens and do not include the once-weekly 
(in continuation phase) fluoroquinolone 6-month experimental regimen in the 
RIFAQUIN trial. The three trials that compared four fluoroquinolone-based 
tuberculosis regimens to a 6-month standard regimen provided data for identifying 
markers and models for risk stratification, while the DMID 01-009 trial data 
were used for external validation. We defined the experimental group as all study 
participants allocated to any of the 4-month experimental regimens and the control 
group as all study participants allocated to the 6-month standard regimen. The 
protocol for each study was reviewed and approved by ethics committees and 
regulatory committees described in the original publications, and all participants 
provided written informed consent1–3,9.
Data acquisition, management and harmonization. Integrated and standardized 
individual-level data in each of the trials were obtained through the Platform  
for Aggregation of Clinical TB Studies (TB-PACTS; https://c-path.org/programs/
tb-pacts/). Data sharing was directed by comprehensive data contribution 
agreements with sponsors. Before data were pooled, we compared trial protocols, 
case report forms and data dictionaries to harmonize databases. Data queries 
were resolved through direct consultations with each trial team and Critical Path 
Institute data managers. After pooling data, data inputs were checked for missing 
or duplicated values, for consistency and for plausibility. Final dataset specification 
is available in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, and access to original databases is 
available through TB-PACTS. Data from DMID 01-009 were obtained directly 
from the sponsor. Further information on data acquisition and availability is 
described in the Life Sciences Reporting Summary.
Efficacy outcomes. The primary efficacy endpoint of the pooled analysis was time 
to an unfavorable outcome for a maximum of 24 months after start of treatment 
(OFLOTUB study participants were followed until 24 months after start of 
treatment, and RIFAQUIN and REMoxTB study participants were followed for 
18 months), as defined according to each trial protocol and described in the original 
publications. Trial-specific definitions of unfavorable outcome were broadly  
similar but included some differences, which are outlined in Supplementary  
Table 1. For example, re-infections confirmed by mycobacterial interspersed 
repetitive unit (MIRU) typing were excluded from the composite definition of 
unfavorable outcome in the primary analysis of the REMoxTB and RIFAQUIN 
trials, whereas they were included in the composite definition of unfavorable 
outcome in the primary analysis of the OFLOTUB trial. Sensitivity analyses were 
performed to evaluate the inclusion of all MIRU-confirmed re-infections, classified 
as unfavorable (Supplementary Table 11) or favorable or completely removed  
from the analysis. The secondary efficacy outcome was the non-parametric  
Kaplan–Meier estimate of unfavorable outcome at 24 months after start of treatment.
Baseline predictors. The primary analysis set included baseline predictors, which 
were missing in no more than 10% of participants: age, race, BMI, sex, presence 
of cavitation on chest radiograph and smear grade (Supplementary Table 2). 
Weight was also considered for inclusion in the primary analysis but ultimately 
was not included due to its moderate correlation with BMI (Spearman coefficient, 
0.74; Supplementary Fig. 3). No major covariate imputation was done, with two 
exceptions: (1) black race was assigned for all participants in the OFLOTUB trial, 
in which race information was not available, given that all OFLOTUB sites were 
in Africa and similar demographic characteristics were observed in other studies 
at their African sites (majority black); (2) median height for females and males 
of available data was used for 291 participants with missing height to calculate 
BMI, defined as the weight in kilograms divided by the squared height in meters 
(additional details available in Supplementary Table 2). Smear grading was specific 
for each microscopy method, each study and, in the RIFAQUIN trial, each study 
center (described in study protocols and lab manuals)1–3,9. The RIFAQUIN and 
OFLOTUB trials reported smear grade using a negative, 1+ 
, 2+ 
 and 3+ system, 
while the REMoxTB and the validation study reported smear grade using a 1+ 
, 2+ 
,  
3+ 
 and 4+ system. A conversion chart available in the REMoxTB trial lab manual 
was used to synchronize all smear data to the same grading scale2. Additional 
participant characteristics (smoking, cough grade and other radiographic 
measures) were considered but not included in the primary analysis due to large 
proportions of missing data (> 
10%; Supplementary Table 2).
On-treatment predictors. On-treatment culture time point universally applied in 
all trials was month 2 culture status on Lowenstein–Jensen (LJ) solid medium or 
in liquid medium using the mycobacteria growth indicator tube (MGIT) system. 
Culture positivity on either medium was used for analyses, with preference for 
solid culture if available. Univariate Cox proportional hazard analysis for merged 
MGIT and LJ culture data (as described above), MGIT data only and LJ data 
only showed similar results in each treatment group (Supplementary Table 12). 
Treatment adherence was calculated as the number of days that doses were taken 
divided by the prescribed number of days. For participants with an unfavorable 
event during the treatment phase, the adherence calculation was adjusted 
for duration completed; for example, full adherence was assigned for study 
participants who took all doses up to the time of the event if the event appeared 
during treatment.
Individuals with missing data between the predefined sets of predictors 
were excluded from the multivariate analysis (summary on analysis populations 
available in Supplementary Table 3). There were no major correlations between the 
predefined sets of baseline and on-treatment predictors (Supplementary Fig. 3).
Statistical analysis. All analyses were conducted using modified intent-to-treat 
and per-protocol populations, with the former used for primary analysis (per-
protocol results summarized in Supplementary Table 6). Definitions for analysis 
populations are provided in the clinical trial protocols1–3,9.
To identify risk factors of time to unfavorable outcomes, we performed 
multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis. HRs with 95% Wald CIs were 
reported. Analyses were conducted separately for the experimental and control 
regimens, as the hard-to-treat phenotypes may be different for different treatment 
durations. All multivariate analyses were adjusted for study country. The 
proportional hazard assumption was tested using Schoenfeld residuals, with a 
P < 0.05 for non-proportionality. Model selection for multivariate Cox analysis 
started with a full model (included all predefined predictors) that was followed 
by a backward stepwise approach (P > 0.05 to remove), then a forward stepwise 
approach to test predictors that were removed in the backward step (P < 0.01 to 
include). Predictors were included using linear relationships. Non-inferiority 
analyses were performed in study participant subgroups, according to identified 
risk factors in the multivariate Cox analysis. The test for interaction for each 
subgroup was performed prior to non-inferiority subgroup tests21. The absolute 
difference in percentage of unfavorable outcomes was calculated using inverse 
probability study weighted Kaplan–Meier estimates22 at 24 months after start of 
treatment to include maximal patient-years of follow-up and retain maximal 
data. Non-inferiority was assessed using the upper bound of the two-sided 90% 
CI, determined by bootstrapping 500 samples, and a non-inferiority margin of 6 
percentage points, which was used in all the parent trials1–3.
Further analyses were performed to assess the impact of 7/7 (REMoxTB and 
RIFAQUIN) and 6/7 (OFLOTUB) weekly dosing strategies on outcomes. First, 
we compared Kaplan–Meier estimates for 7/7 and 6/7 weekly dosing strategies 
in study participants who completed their prescribed treatment. Second, we 
performed separate Cox proportional hazards analyses for trials with different 
weekly dosing strategies and assessed total number of days that the drugs were 
taken (total doses) and treatment duration (time between first and last dose dates) 
as predictors of treatment outcomes. To allow for pragmatic interpretation, HRs 
were reported for total doses of 156 to 181 (on average 6/7 doses per week) and 112 
to 155 (on average 5/7 doses per week) relative to 182 (on average 7/7 doses per 
week) for the REMoxTB and RIFAQUIN analysis (7/7 weekly dosing strategies for 
26 weeks). For the OFLOTUB analysis (6/7 weekly dosing strategy for 24 weeks), 
HRs were reported for total doses of 112 to 143 (on average 5/7 doses per week) 
relative to 144 (on average 6/7 doses per week). We have used an arbitrarily lower 
cutoff of 112 total doses, as it coincides with 4 months of treatment on a 7/7 dosing 
strategy and most of the data were clustered above this cutoff point. We have 
performed sensitivity analysis with cutoffs of at least 130 (exact number of doses if 
participant took 5/7 doses for 26 weeks) for the REMoxTB and RIFAQUIN analysis 
and 120 (exact number of doses if participant took 5/7 doses for 24 weeks) for the 
OFLOTUB analysis. Each analysis was adjusted for study country.
All data management, analyses and visualization were performed using R 
statistical software (version 3.4.3; https://www.r-project.org/).
