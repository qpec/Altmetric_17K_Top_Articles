Stroke is a leading cause of disability and currently lacks effective therapy enabling long-term functional recovery. Ischemic brain injury
causes local inflammation, which involves both activated resident microglia and infiltrating immune cells, including monocytes.
Monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) exhibit a high degree of functional plasticity. Here, we determined the role of MDMs in long-
termspontaneousfunctionalrecoveryaftermiddlecerebralarteryocclusioninmice.Analysesbyflowcytometryandimmunocytochem-
istry revealed that monocytes home to the stroke-injured hemisphere., and that infiltration peaks 3 d after stroke. At day 7, half of the
infiltratingMDMsexhibitedabiastowardaproinflammatoryphenotypeandtheotherhalftowardananti-inflammatoryphenotype,but
during the subsequent 2 weeks, MDMs with an anti-inflammatory phenotype dominated. Blocking monocyte recruitment using the
anti-CCR2 antibody MC-21 during the first week after stroke abolished long-term behavioral recovery, as determined in corridor and
staircase tests, and drastically decreased tissue expression of anti-inflammatory genes, including TGF�, CD163, and Ym1. Our results
show that spontaneously recruited monocytes to the injured brain early after the insult contribute to long-term functional recovery after
stroke.

Introduction
Ischemic stroke is followed by local immune responses that encom-
pass microglia and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) infil-
trating from the circulation (Gelderblom et al., 2009; Shechter et al.,

in addition to that of microglia and have emphasized that these two
myeloid populations display nonredundant functions (Shechter et

Significance Statement
For decades, any involvement of circulating immune cells in CNS repair was completely denied. Only over the past few years has
involvement of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) in CNS repair received appreciation. We show here, for the first time,
that MDMs recruited to the injured brain early after ischemic stroke contribute to long-term spontaneous functional recovery
through inflammation-resolving activity. Our data raise the possibility that inadequate recruitment of MDMs to the brain after
stroke underlies the incomplete functional recovery seen in patients and that boosting homing of MDMs with an anti-
inflammatorybiastotheinjuredbraintissuemaybeanewtherapeuticapproachtopromotelong-termimprovementafterstroke.

´rez, 2015). In a model of spinal cord injury, MDMs,
which locally display anti-inflammatory activities, are required to
resolve the local inflammation and to facilitate scar resolution
(Shechter et al., 2013). Both the local inflammation and the scar are
essential interim stages in the repair process, yet their timely resolu-
tion is critical, and if it does not occur in a timely manner, chronic
inflammationandimpairedfunctionalrecoverymayensue(Clarket
al., 1993; Rolls et al., 2008).
Outside the CNS, resolution of inflammation is an active pro-
cess that involves myeloid cells of distinct phenotypes, which
could reflect either recruitment of different cells with distinct
phenotypes or local conversion of cells from a proinflammatory
to an anti- inflammatory phenotype (Ksander et al., 1991; Lon-
don et al., 2011). For myeloid cells to benefit repair, their pres-
ence and distinct activities should be well orchestrated in
synchrony with the tissue needs (Shechter and Schwartz, 2013;
Raposo et al., 2014; Gadani et al., 2015). Such an understanding is
now widely appreciated in several models of neurodegenerative
conditions (Yong and Rivest, 2009; Hu et al., 2015).
The role of myeloid cells in the functional recovery process
after stroke is poorly understood. In hemorrhagic stroke, MDMs
are needed to promote vascular healing (Gliem et al., 2012), yet
the involvement of MDMs in the repair processes beyond the
acute phase, at the remodeling stage, and during long-term func-
tional restoration has not been studied.
The objectives of the present study were two-fold: (1) to ex-
plore the contribution of infiltrating MDMs to long-term spon-
taneous functional recovery after stroke; and (2) to characterize
the phenotype and possible mechanisms of action of recruited
monocytes during poststroke recovery.
We show that MDMs infiltrate the sites of ischemic stroke and
that a switch of their phenotype occurs from proinflammatory to
anti-inflammatory with time after injury. Most importantly, we
demonstrate that depletion of monocytes from the circulation at
the early stage after the ischemic event, resulting in limited MDM
recruitment to the site of lesion, leads to impaired recovery of
sensorimotor function as assessed at the chronic phase after
stroke. Our findings suggest that timely recruitment of immune
cells is critical for spontaneous long-term recovery.
Materials and Methods
Animals. All procedures were performed in accordance with the guide-
lines set by the Malmo
¨-Lund Ethical Committee for the use of laboratory
animals and were conducted in accordance with the European Union
directive on the subject of animal rights. Stroke surgeries were performed
on male C57BL/6J and B6SJL (CD45.1) mice (25–30 g; Charles River),
and CX3CR1–EGFP (CD45.2) and �-actin–GFP � C57BL/C mice were
used as donors for bone marrow and monocyte transplantation, respec-
tively. All animals were kept in 12 h light/dark cycles. Food and water
were provided ad libitum except during behavioral tests when mice were
kept under food restriction to raise their motivation.
Chimera generation. Bone marrow chimeric mice were prepared by
subjecting recipients to myeloablative treatment through whole-body
irradiation with 10 Gy with head protection. All mice were transferred to
a sterile condition. Antibiotic supplements in drinking water were pro-
vided from 1 week before and at least 1 week after myeloablation. Bone
marrow cells were collected from CX3CR1–EGFP donors and purified
on the day of transplantation. Briefly, the tibia and femur were entirely
removed from the fresh cadaver. Bone marrow was flushed out with 5%
fetal bovine serum (FBS) in Dulbecco’s PBS (DPBS) using a needle
placed at an end of the bone. Cell preparation was filtered through sterile
35 �m nylon mesh and washed three times by 10 min centrifugation at
300 � g, and pellet was resuspended with FBS-free DPBS. The total
number of cells was evaluated during washing, and the desired concen-
tration was prepared after the last centrifugation. Between 4 and 12 h
after irradiation, 2 � 10 7 cells in 200 �l were injected in the tail vein of
recipients. Hydration status was monitored carefully during 2 weeks after
transplantation.
Middle cerebral artery occlusion. Stroke was induced using the intralu-
minal filament model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) as
described previously in mice (Hara et al., 1996; Andsberg et al., 2001).
The right common carotid artery (CCA) and its proximal branches were
isolated. The CCA and external carotid artery (ECA) were ligated, and the
internal carotid artery (ICA) was temporarily occluded using a metal
microvessel clip. A nylon monofilament was advanced through the ICA
until resistance was felt (�9 mm distance). The nylon filament was care-
fully removed after 30 min occlusion, ECA was ligated permanently, and
the surgical wound was closed. In sham-operated animals, the filament
was advanced only a few millimeters inside the ICA. Special care was
taken during 1 week after surgery. A high-calorie gel diet (DietGel Boost;
ClearH2O) was supplemented, and Ringer’s solution was injected subcu-
taneously daily in case of dehydration. Animals were allocated randomly
to stroke or sham surgery and to the different experimental groups.
Monocyte transplantation. Bone marrow cells were collected from
CX3CR1–EGFP (CD45.2) or �-actin–GFP � C57BL/C donor mice by
crushing the femurs, tibiae, and hips. Cells were passed through a 50 �m
pore diameter strainer and rinsed with DPBS supplemented with 2%
FBS. CD115 � cells were isolated using a magnetic cell separation system
and biotinylated anti-CD115 antibody combined with streptavidin-
magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec).
Behavioral tests. Staircase and corridor tests were performed by re-
searchers blinded to the three experimental groups: (1) sham-treated and
vehicle-injected (“sham”); (2) stroke-subjected and vehicle-injected
(“vehicle”); and (3) stroke-subjected and MC-21-injected (“MC-21”).
The staircase test was used to assess “side-specific” skilled forelimb
reaching and grasping abilities (Montoya et al., 1991; Baird et al., 2001) in
a staircase apparatus (Campden Instruments). Briefly, animals were food
deprived 12 h before the first testing day and kept on a restricted food
intake (2.5–3.5 g/d) so that the body weight did not fall below 85% of
initial value. Food was provided only after the daily test session. When
testing, animals were placed in Plexiglas boxes holding a removable dou-
ble staircase, with two chocolate pellets (TestDiet) placed on each of steps
3 to 8 on both sides (total of 12 pellets/side). During each session, animals
were kept in the box for 15 min once a day, after which the number of
pellets retrieved and eaten on each side was calculated. Retrieved pellet
was identified as pellets that had been removed from the original step,
regardless of whether or not the pellet had been eaten. Before MCAO,
mice were tested for 12 consecutive days. The Mean number of retrieved
and eaten pellets from the last 3 d was used as the preinsult performance
score. At weeks 1, 3, and 7 after MCAO, mice were retested for 5 d using
the same method, and the average of the last 3 d was calculated.
The corridor test (Dowd et al., 2005), adapted to mice (Grealish et al.,
2010), was used to assess sensorimotor impairment caused by striatal
damage. Briefly, mice were food restricted in the same manner as in
staircase test throughout habituation and testing. At the first time point,
mice were habituated to the corridor by scattering sugar pellets along the
floor and allowing them to freely explore for 10 min on 2 consecutive
days before testing. When testing began, the mice were transferred to one
end of the testing corridor. The number of ipsilateral and contralateral
retrievals was counted until the mouse made a total of 20 retrievals or a
maximum time of 5 min had elapsed. A “retrieval” was defined as an
exploration into a pot, whether or not a pellet was eaten, and a new
retrieval could only be made by investigating a new pot. Retrieval average
was calculated from last 3 testing days. Data are expressed as percentage
contralateral (relative to lesion) retrievals, calculated as the number of
contralateral retrievals in percentage of the total retrievals made from
both sides. Results from later tests, weeks 1, 3, 7, and 11 after MCAO,
were used as the poststroke performance score.
Flow cytometry. Blood sample collection and flow cytometry were per-
formed by researchers blinded to the identity of the groups. Peripheral
blood was collected from the tail vein of mice at days 4, 7, 10, and 14 after
MCAO. Erythrocytes were lysed with ammonium chloride. Leukocyte
single-cell suspensions were analyzed using the following antibodies:
CD45.1-Brilliant Violet 510 (Biolegend), CD45.2-Phycoerytrin-PE

 (Biolegend), CD45-Brilliant Violet 510 (Biolegend), CD11b-Brilliant Vi-
olet 421 (Biolegend), Ly6C-Alexa Fluor 700 (BD Bioscience), CD115-
APC (BD Bioscience), CCR2-Fluorescin-FITC (R&D Systems), and
CX3CR1-Phycoerythrin-PE (R&D System). Flow cytometry was per-
formed with FACSAria III cell sorter (BD Biosciences) or LSR II analyzer
(BD Bioscience), following the specifications for each fluorophore. Data
were analyzed using FlowJo software (FlowJo).
For brain tissue analysis, animals were sublethally anesthetized by in-
traperitoneal injection of pentobarbital. Mice were then perfused tran-
scardially with sterile cold saline solution until the blood was completely
washed out. Brains were quickly removed and placed in cold hibernation
medium (Kawamoto and Barrett, 1986). Brains were dissociated using
Neural Tissue Dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the instruc-
tions of the manufacturer. Myelin debris was removed by using magnetic
beads (Miltenyi Biotec). Cells were stained and analyzed following the
same protocol as for blood samples.
MC-21 injection. Production of the anti-CCR2 monoclonal antibody
MC-21 was performed as described previously (Mack et al., 2001). MC-21
was used to selectively deplete CD115�/CD11b�/Ly6C� monocytes from
the blood. MC-21 was injected intraperitoneally immediately after MCAO
and on the first 3 d of recovery (days 0, 1, 2, and 3 after injury). We initially
tested whether isotype control for MC-21 antibody (Rat IgG2b; BD
Pharmingen) or PBS injections with the same regimen and volume as for
MC-21 antibody would affect the number of circulating CCR2� monocytes
instroke-subjectedanimals.Weobservednodifferencesbetweenthecontrol
antibody- and PBS-injected groups, and, therefore, we used PBS injection as
vehicle and treatment control in all experiments.
RNA extraction and quantitative PCR. Brain dissection and gene ex-
pression analysis were performed by researchers blinded to the groups.
Mice were deeply anesthetized and perfused transcardially with heparin-
ized saline. Brains were dissected, the forebrain was isolated from menin-
ges, and hemispheres ipsilateral (right) and contralateral (left) to injury
were separated. Total RNA was extracted from the tissue using RNeasy
mini kit (Qiagen) and then reversed to cDNA using Quanta qScript
cDNA Synthesis kit (Quanta Biosciences). For quantitative PCR,
TaqMan Gene expression master mix (Life Technologies) and TaqMan
assays for proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory genes (Table 1) were
used. Cycle threshold values of target genes were normalized to geomet-
ric mean of housekeeping hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase
(HPRT) and GAPDH.
Immunocytochemistry. Mice were deeply anesthetized with an over-
dose of pentobarbital and perfused transcardially with cold saline solu-
tion, followed by 4% cold paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were
postfixed overnight in 4% PFA and then placed in 20% sucrose for 24 h
before coronal sectioning (30 �m thickness) on dry ice. Sections were
preincubated in blocking solution (5% normal serum and 0.25% Triton
X-100 in 0.1 M potassium-buffered PBS). Primary antibodies (Table 2)
were diluted in the blocking solution and applied overnight at 4°C. Cor-
responding fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen or
The Jackson Laboratory) were diluted in blocking solution and applied
for 2 h, followed by three rinses in potassium–PBS.
Single labeling for NeuN was performed with biotinylated horse anti-
mouse antibody and visualized with avidin–biotin–peroxidase complex
(Elite ABC kit; Vector Laboratories), followed by peroxidase-catalyzed
diaminobenzidine reaction.
Quantifications and statistical analysis. All quantifications and statisti-
cal analyses were performed by researchers blinded to the experimental
groups. Counting of infiltrated monocytes was performed in GFP-
stained sections. Whole-hemisphere images were acquired digitally using
epifluorescence microscopy and cellSens Dimension version 1.8 software
(Olympus Corporation). The number of immunopositive cells was esti-
mated by a threshold-based object detection analysis method.
The numbers of ED1 � and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule
1-positive (Iba1 �) cells were quantified in the ipsilateral striatum in
three coronal sections at �0.62, �0.86, �1.1 mm from bregma using an
epifluorescence microscope with 40� objective. Iba1 � and Iba1 �/
ED1 � cells were counted within a column of four continuous fields using
a 0.25 � 0.25 mm 2 quadratic grid placed in the non-infarcted area next
to the subventricular zone with the uppermost grid located just below the
corpus callosum.
For lesion volume estimation, images of NeuN–DAB-stained sections
were first taken under 4� magnification. Intact areas identified by
NeuN � cells in the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres were delin-
eated and then measured using Visiopharm software. The area of unle-
sioned tissue in the ipsilateral hemisphere was subtracted from that of the
contralateral hemisphere to get the infarct area, and this area was subse-
quently multiplied by the distance between the sections (240 �m) to get
the infarct volume.
Comparisons were performed using GraphPad Prism version 6.05
(GraphPad Software) by one-way or two-way ANOVA, followed by Bon-
ferroni’s multiple comparisons test, or Student’s unpaired t test. Data are
presented as means � SEMs, and differences are considered significant at
p � 0.05.
Results
Transplanted and endogenous monocytes are recruited to
injured brain tissue after stroke
We first assessed whether monocytes home to sites of injury in the
stroke-affected brain. To be able to trace the monocytes and identify
their homing site, we passively transferred homologous monocytes
isolated from the bone marrow of �-actin–GFP� C57BL/C mice
into syngenic wild-type mice that do not express GFP. This allows
distinction between infiltrating monocytes and resident activated
microglia. Two groups of animals were subjected to MCAO and on
the next day injected through the tail vein with 4 million GFP�/

Wattananit et al. • Monocytes for Long-Term Recovery after Stroke
 CD115�monocytesorvehicle,respectively.
The purity of the CD115� population was
94–98% as defined by flow cytometry. Two
days later, blood samples and brain tissue
(ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres
separately) were taken for analysis by
flow cytometry, and some animals were
processed for immunocytochemistry. At
this time point, the GFP�/CD115� graf-
ted monocytes constituted 0.85% of all
CD115� monocytes in the blood, whereas
in vehicle-injected animals, only very few
autofluorescent
events
were
recorded
(Fig. 1A).
Immunocytochemistry revealed that
grafted GFP � monocytes were located ex-
clusively in the ipsilateral hemisphere, the
overall majority within the ischemically
injured striatum (Fig. 1B,C,I). Approxi-
mately 6000 GFP � cells per brain were
found (Fig. 1C). The injured striatum was
filled with cells immunoreactive for the
microglia marker Iba1 (Fig. 1D). Most
likely, these cells were resident microglia
because freshly recruited monocytes are
not Iba1 �, and, moreover, not a single
GFP � cell showed Iba1 immunoreactivity
(Fig. 1E–G). The vast majority (�80%) of
the GFP � cells were positive for the acti-
vated macrophage marker isolectin (IB4;
Fig. 1J–M), providing evidence that they
had become activated macrophages.
Wethenassessedwhetherthenumberof
recruited transplanted cells reflects their in-
cidence in the blood. To this end, a group of
mice was injected with 2 million GFP�
monocytes, i.e., half the number compared
with the initial experiment in which 4
million cells were injected. Interestingly, at
day 3 after stroke, the GFP�/CD115�
grafted monocytes constituted 0.53% of all
CD115� monocytes in the blood (Fig. 1A),
and we detected approximately half the
number of GFP� cells per brain in animals
injected with 2 million compared with 4
million cells. Virtually all GFP� monocytes
that infiltrated to the brain were localized
within the injured tissue (Fig. 1C,F). These
findings indicate that the number of mo-
nocytes homing to the ischemic lesion
correlates with the number of CD115� cir-
culating monocytes.
To validate these data and estimate the
ratio between microglia and infiltrating
grafted and endogenously recruited mono-
cytes, we repeated the same transplantation
paradigmasinthepreviousexperimentand
administered 4 million monocytes from
CD45.2 mice to stroke-subjected CD45.1
mice. Microglia and infiltrating, endoge-
nously recruited or grafted MDMs were
then distinguished based on levels of CD45,
being low and high, respectively (Sedgwick

 et al., 1991; Shechter et al., 2013). In the contralateral, intact hemi-
sphere (Fig. 2A), the MDMs (CD45.1high) constituted �3% of all
CD11b� cells, but there were virtually no grafted CD45.2� MDMs.
Thevastmajority(85.1%)ofCD11b�cellswereresidentCD45.1low
microglia. In the ipsilateral hemisphere, we detected a small popula-
tion(0.69%ofallCD45high cells)ofCD45.2high graftedMDMs(Fig.
2B). However, they were extremely few compared with the infil-
trated, endogenously recruited CD 45.1high MDMs, which repre-
sented approximately half of all CD11b� cells. Together, our data
show that, within 2 d after transplantation, the grafted monocytes
home to the stroke-injured hemisphere, in which they represent
only a very small fraction of CD11b� microglia and are much fewer
than endogenously derived monocytes.
Infiltration of endogenous circulating monocytes peaks at 3 d
after stroke
To explore in detail the extent and dynamics of spontaneous
monocyte infiltration to the stroke-injured brain, we killed mice
at different time points after stroke and analyzed by flow cytom-
etry the myeloid cell composition in both hemispheres (Fig. 3A).
We found that the numbers of spontaneously infiltrating
MDMs in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the insult reached a peak
(�60-fold increase compared with the hemisphere on contralat-
eral side or in intact or sham-treated animals) at 3 d after stroke
and then declined rapidly, still being higher at 7 d compared with
contralateral side but reaching control values at 14 d (Fig. 3B).
The numbers of MDMs in sham-operated and intact mice at
1 d after treatment (Fig. 3B) were similar to those after stroke in
the ipsilateral hemisphere on the day of the injury and in the
contralateral hemisphere at all tested time points (Fig. 3A,B). We
assumed that the majority of these cells were residual blood
monocytes in brain capillaries. We stained the brains of sham-
operated animals with CD31 as a marker for vessels, IB4 for acti-
vated macrophages, and Iba1 as a microglia/macrophage marker
(Fig. 3C). In support of our contention, the IB4 � monocytes
were clearly located within the blood vessel lumen, whereas the
Iba1 � microglia, exhibiting ramified resting phenotype, were
found in the brain parenchyma.
Depletion of circulating monocytes during the first week after
stroke impairs long-term spontaneous recovery
To explore the potential role of MDMs for spontaneous func-
tional recovery after stroke, we depleted circulating monocytes
during the first week after the insult, i.e., at a time when maxi-
mum monocyte infiltration takes place. We selectively depleted
Ly6C �/CCR2 � monocytes from peripheral blood using the anti-
CCR2 antibody MC-21 (Mack et al., 2001; Shechter et al., 2009).

 known as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 or MCP-1),
which mediates monocyte egress from the bone marrow to the
circulation. Also, the CCR2 � cells are the ones recruited to in-
jured tissues outside (Wetzler et al., 2000; Peters and Charo, 2001;
Peters et al., 2001; Bose and Cho, 2013) and to the CNS (Yan et al.,
2007; Shechter et al., 2009; Prinz and Priller, 2010; Saederup et al.,
2010). Animals were subjected to stroke and injected with MC-21
antibody the same day and at 1, 2, and 3 d after the insult. Sham-
treated and stroke-subjected mice were injected with vehicle and
served as controls. Blood samples collected at 4 d after stroke (1 d
after the last injection of MC-21) revealed nearly complete loss of
circulating monocytes in all MC-21-treated animals (Fig. 4A). At
10 d, the CCR2 � monocytes in peripheral blood had started to
rebound and at 14 d had returned to normal level. Thus, the
systemic administration of MC-21 antibody efficiently depleted
circulating monocytes during the first week after stroke, as ob-
served previously in other models of CNS insults (Shechter et al.,
2009).
We next determined whether depletion of circulating CCR2 �
monocytes leads to reduction of the number of MDMs in the
brain. Two groups of animals were subjected to stroke and in-
jected with vehicle or MC-21 antibody as above. On day 3 after
the insult, when in the previous experiment we had detected the
highest level of infiltrating MDMs in the brain, we measured the
effect of MC-21 antibody injection on numbers of blood CCR2 �
cells and infiltrating brain MDMs. The reduction of brain
CD45 high/CD11b high MDMs in the MC-21 group was 86.8 �
5.8%, which closely resembled the decrease of circulating CCR2 �
monocytes in the blood at the same time point (89.9 � 1.5%). We
found strong positive correlation (R 2 � 0.90) between the blood
level of infiltrating CCR2 � monocytes and the number of MDMs
(CD45 high/CD11b high) in the brain (Fig. 4B).
Based on these findings, we performed behavioral tests to as-
sess how depletion of monocytes during the first week after stroke
would affect the long-term functional recovery. All animals were
subjected to corridor (1 week before and 1, 3, 7, and 11 weeks
after stroke) and staircase tests (1 week before and 1, 3, and 7
weeks after stroke). Sham-treated animals showed normal behav-
ior in corridor and staircase tests. We observed impairments in
the corridor test on the contralateral side from 1 to 7 weeks after
stroke in both vehicle- and MC-21-injected animals (Fig. 5A).
Interestingly, at 11 weeks, we found spontaneous behavioral re-
covery, with the test performance reaching the control level, in
vehicle-injected mice. In contrast, in MC-21-treated animals, the

 impairment was maintained at the same
level as at earlier time points (Fig. 5A). In
the staircase test, both vehicle- and MC-
21-injected mice showed a similar impair-
ment in the number of retrieved pellets on
the contralateral side at 1 week after
stroke. At 3 weeks, the performance of the
vehicle-injected mice did not differ from
that
of
the
sham-operated
animals,
whereas MC-21-treated mice still showed
impairment. At 7 weeks, the number of
retrieved pellets was similar in all three
groups. These findings suggest a delayed
recovery in this task in the monocyte-
depleted group. Similarly, when behavior
in the staircase test was assessed by the
number of eaten pellets, we found that the
vehicle-injec-
ted group had recovered at 7 weeks,
whereas the MC-21-injected animals re-
mained impaired (Fig. 5C). To rule out
the possibility that the worsening of long-
term behavioral recovery in MC-21-
injected mice was an outcome of more
extensive ischemic injury, we analyzed the
lesion site by immunohistochemistry.
NeuN-stained sections revealed no differ-
ence in infarct volume between the
vehicle- and MC-21-treated groups at 18
weeks after stroke (Fig. 5D,E).
MDMs switch bias from
proinflammatory to anti-inflammatory
activity during the first weeks after
stroke
To explore potential mechanisms unde-
rlying the recovery-promoting effect of
MDMs, we first wanted to distinguish
MDMs from activated microglia and deter-
mine their phenotype. Therefore, we gener-
ated chimeric mice by subjecting wild-type
mice to bone marrow transplantation from
CX3CR1–GFP mice. Notably, all mice were
head protected during the irradiation that
precedesthebonemarrowtransplantation(Shechteretal.,2009).In
CX3CR1–GFP mice, CX3CR1� monocytes and microglia are
GFP� (Jung et al., 2000). However, in the chimeric animals, only
bone marrow-derived monocytes are GFP�, which allows identifi-
cation of MDMs with both immunocytochemistry and flow cytom-
etry (Mildner et al., 2007).
Immunocytochemistry of brain sections from chimeric mice
showed that, at 7 d after stroke, the majority of GFP � MDMs
were distributed within the ischemically injured tissue, with some
of them being localized in close proximity to the lesion border
(Fig. 6A–C). This was in line with our previous experiments that
showed that, already at 3 d after stroke, intravenously trans-
planted monocytes infiltrate the stroke-injured tissue (Fig. 1).
The lesion border was clearly delineated by GFAP � activated
astrocytes, most of which were found outside the lesion core (Fig.
6B,C). The vast majority of the MDMs showed IB4 immunore-
activity (Fig. 6D). In brain tissue from the contralateral hemi-
sphere or from sham-operated animals, virtually no GFP � bone
marrow-derived monocytes were detected.
The flow cytometry analysis of tissue from the stroke-subjected
mice confirmed that blood-borne monocytes had efficiently infil-
trated only the injured hemisphere (Fig. 7A). Two major subpopu-
lations of MDMs have been described previously: (1) the
proinflammatory (Ly6Chigh) population; and (2) the alternatively
activated anti-inflammatory population (Ly6Clow; Gordon and
Taylor, 2005). We separated infiltrating MDMs and resident micro-
glia based on CD45 and CD11b expression, and then we further
separated the MDM population based on expression of CX3CR1
and Ly6C. We observed that the two subpopulations of MDMs in
the brain after stroke, namely Ly6Chigh/CX3CR1low and Ly6Clow/
CX3CR1int, underwent dramatic changes in the ipsilateral hemi-
sphere: at the early time point (day 3 after injury), the relative
percentage of the Ly6Chigh/CX3CR1low MDM subpopulation was
high but was then significantly reduced by day 7. In contrast, the
relative percentage of the Ly6Clow/CX3CR1int population remained
relatively unchanged (Fig. 7A).
We further analyzed the phenotype of MDMs in intact and
stroke-injured hemispheres at different time points after the in-

 sult (Fig. 7B). In intact animals, �70% of monocytes were
Ly6C low/CX3CR1 int and only 5% were Ly6C high/CX3CR1 low
(Fig. 7B). Most of the monocytes in the intact brain are those that
have not been washed out from capillaries during the perfusion of
animals before brain excision (Fig. 3C). At day 1 after stroke,
�40% of the MDMs were Ly6C high/CX3CR1 low, reaching the
peak at day 3 (53%). Their percentage then gradually decreased to
18.3% at day 21. At day 3 after stroke, the percentage of Ly6C low/
CX3CR1 int MDMs was 19%, and their percentage increased at
day 7 (34.2%) and then remained stable at days 14 and 21 (40.1
and 38.7%, respectively). Together, our data show that the rela-
tive ratio between the two subpopulations of MDMs was shifted
toward the proinflammatory phenotype at day 3 and toward the
anti-inflammatory phenotype thereafter (Fig. 7B).
We then asked whether the increase of the number of MDMs
with the Ly6Clow/CX3CR1int phenotype from day 3 to day 7 after
stroke was accompanied by corresponding changes in anti-
inflammatory
characteristics.
The
Ly6Chigh/CX3CR1low
and
Ly6Clow/CX3CR1int populations were analyzed by flow cytometry
for the expression of characteristic markers of anti-inflammatory
activity, CD206, Dectin-1, and CD204. The percentage of cells ex-
pressing CD206 and Dectin-1 was increased within the Ly6Clow/
CX3CR1int but not within the Ly6Chigh/CX3CR1low subpopulation
(Fig. 7C). The percentage of cells immunoreactive for CD204�,
knownasmacrophagescavengerreceptor1,didnotchangeineither
population (Fig. 7C).
We also analyzed the ratio between MDMs and microglia in
chimeric animals at days 3 and 7 after stroke. At 3 d, when the
number of MDMs was at its maximum, they represented 61.6%
of the whole CD45 �/CD11b � cell population, whereas microglia
constituted 24.6% (Fig. 7D). Conversely, at 7 d after stroke, mi-
croglia had become the dominant population, representing
66.9% and MDMs only 12.6%. The phenotypic characterization
of microglia based on flow cytometry analysis of Ly6C and
CX3CR1 expression revealed (Fig. 7E) that, at both time points,
these cells had predominantly proinflammatory activity (65.2
and 88.2% at 3 and 7 d, respectively).
TheimmunologicalmilieuisdeterminednotonlybyMDMsand
microglia but also by other cells producing proinflammatory and
anti-inflammatory factors. Therefore, we assessed the overall
changes in expression of several proinflammatory and anti-
inflammatory genes (Table 1) at 3, 7, and 14 d after stroke in the
ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres (Fig. 8A). Quantitative
PCR revealed upregulation of only the gene encoding for
the anti-inflammatory molecule Ym1 at 3 d after stroke. At 7 d, the
expression of genes encoding for the anti-inflammatory-associated
molecules TGF�1, Ym1, CXCL13, CCL22, and CD163 was in-
creased, along with increased expression of the proinflammation-
associated genes IL-6, TNF�, IL-1�, and NOS2. However, at 14 d,
only two anti-inflammatory genes, TGF�1 and VCAM1, were up-
regulated. No significant changes in the expression of the other ex-

 amined proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory genes were
detected (Table 1).
Changes in the expression of some proinflammatory and anti-
inflammatory proteins in MDMs were verified by immunocyto-
chemistry in the CX3CR1–GFP chimeric mice (Fig. 8D). We used
three antibodies, against IL-6, TGF�, and BDNF, respectively,
which gave rise to specific labeling. Confocal microscopy revealed
that, at 7 d after the insult, virtually all IL-6 � cells were GFP �
MDMs (Fig. 8D). Of all TGF� � and BDNF � cells, 88.1 � 34.3
and 82.3 � 22.2%, respectively, were also GFP � at 7 d after
stroke. These findings indicate that MDMs were the main source
of these growth factors, although other cells such as neurons and
astrocytes may also contribute. We estimated that 90.7 � 5.6 and
87.5 � 5.3% of MDMs were IL-6 � at 3 and 7 d after stroke,
respectively. At 3 d after stroke, 85.8 � 6.8 and 85.7 � 9.7% of
MDMs expressed TGF� and BDNF, respectively, which seemed
to increase slightly (to 98.5 � 1.3 and 98.8 � 0.3%, respectively)
at 7 d.
Depletion of circulating monocytes preferentially reduces
anti-inflammatory factor expression in stroke-injured brain
We next examined how the depletion of infiltrating MDMs af-
fected the brain tissue milieu. For this purpose, animals subjected
to stroke and MC-21 or vehicle treatment were killed at 7 and 14 d
after the insult, and the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres
were processed for quantitative PCR analysis of genes with pro-
inflammatory or anti-inflammatory function. At 7 d after stroke,
when circulating monocytes were completely depleted, we de-
tected a dramatic decrease only in gene expression of the cytokine
Ym1 (associated with anti-inflammatory activity; Fig. 9A). Other
tested markers were not altered. However, at 14 d after stroke,
when the number of circulating monocytes was fully restored, we
found significant decreases in gene expression levels of several
anti-inflammatory molecules, such as TGF�1, TGF�2, and
CD163, in the MC-21-treated group (Fig. 9A). At this time point,
decreased gene expression for NOS2 was the only significant dif-
ference in markers of proinflammatory activity in MC-21-treated
compared with vehicle-injected animals. Counting of the num-
ber of activated microglia/macrophages showed that treatment
with MC-21 significantly decreased the percentage of ED1 �/
Iba � cells in the lesioned striatum at 14 d after the insult (Fig. 9B).
These findings support our contention that the contribution of
the infiltrating MDMs to long-term functional recovery could be
attributed to their anti-inflammatory activity.
Discussion
It is well established that ischemic stroke leads to brain inflam-
mation, involving activated astrocytes and microglia, as well as
infiltration of myeloid cells and lymphocytes into the ischemic
brain hemisphere (Kochanek and Hallenbeck, 1992; Tomita and
Fukuuchi, 1996; Stoll et al., 1998; Campanella et al., 2002; Stevens
et al., 2002; Danton and Dietrich, 2003; Gelderblom et al., 2009;
Denes et al., 2010; Jin et al., 2010; Miro
´-Mur et al., 2016). Al-
though excitotoxicity causes neuronal death shortly after the on-
set of the ischemic insult, the inflammatory reaction is part of the
repair mechanism that takes days to reach its peak and, therefore,
gives a reasonable window for therapeutic interventions (Dirnagl
et al., 1999; Shechter and Schwartz, 2013). Here we demonstrate,
for the first time, that the monocytes recruited from the blood to
the stroke-injured brain are importantly involved in the long-
term spontaneous functional recovery. At the lesion site, MDMs
with two distinct phenotypes were found: first, proinflammatory
and, subsequently, anti-inflammatory. Depletion of circulating
monocytes during the first week after stroke and the resulting
decrease of MDMs at the site of the injury caused impaired re-
covery of sensorimotor deficits in the chronic phase after MCAO.
In agreement with our findings, several recent studies have
demonstrated that maximum infiltration of blood-borne mono-
cytes in the ischemic brain tissue occurs within 2 and 3 d after
stroke (Gelderblom et al., 2009; Gliem et al., 2012; Hammond et
al., 2014; Michaud et al., 2014; Ritzel et al., 2015; Miro
´-Mur et al.,
2016). However, those studies were focusing only on the early
events (mostly up to 7 d) after stroke and did not explore the
possible contribution of the infiltrating monocytes to long-term
functional recovery. Recently, it was reported that so-called pa-
trolling Ly6C low monocytes do not influence the progression and
recovery of ischemic stroke (Michaud et al., 2014). In contrast,
several studies indicated a role for infiltrating Ly6C high mono-
cytes in the acute phase after the insult. Gliem et al. (2012) found
that depletion of circulating monocytes during the first days after
MCAO or photothrombotic stroke using chlodronate-filled lipo-
somes or diphtheria toxin injection in mice caused hemorrhagic
transformation of the infarct without affecting lesion volume.
There was also lack of improvement in the rotarod test during the
first 5 d after ischemia. These findings indicated that MDMs are
involved in maintaining the neurovascular unit after stroke. Chu
et al. (2015) injected a selective CCR2 receptor antagonist 1 h
before and 2 and 6 h after MCAO in mice to prevent the recruit-
ment of Ly6C high monocytes to the brain. At 24 h, they found
more extensive lesion and worse functional outcome as evi-
denced by higher neurological deficit score and shorter hanging
wire latency to fall. These findings indicated an acute protective
effect exerted by the recruited monocytes. In line with our
findings, this study also demonstrated that ablation of infiltra-
ting monocytes leads to specific decrease of cells with anti-
inflammatory characteristic activity, such as Ym1, with no effect
on expression of proinflammatory characteristic activities, such

twofold greater proportion of F4/80 � macrophages that were
positive to 3-nitrotyrosine, a feature of a proinflammatory activ-
ity (Chu et al., 2015).
In contrast, in another type of stroke, intracerebral hemor-
rhage, Ly6C high monocytes were recruited to the injured brain,
produced TNF, and contributed to the early functional impair-
ment (Hammond et al., 2014). Ccr2�/� mice and bone-marrow
chimeras, which had fewer monocytes in the brain, displayed less
severe forelimb weakness during the first 1–3 d. A similar effect
was observed after treatment with the MC-21 antibody used here

 ments, the ischemic lesion was relatively small (�5.6 mm 3) and
mostly confined to the dorsolateral part of the striatum. Whether
the long-term beneficial effects of monocytes on impaired senso-
rimotor functions shown in animals with moderate striatal lesion
would also occur in animals with larger striatal or combined
striatocortical damage requires additional investigation. More-
over, the origin, severity, and the type of stroke could affect the
extent and dynamics of the inflammatory response (Zhou et al.,
2013). Together, these findings raise the possibility that the effect
of the infiltrating monocytes and the resulting functional out-
come depend on the type and severity of brain injury and the
stage at which recruitment is blocked and spontaneous recovery
is assessed.
We found strong upregulation of the expression of genes en-
coding for both proinflammatory (IL-6, TNF�, IL-1�, and
NOS2) and anti-inflammatory (Ym1, TGF�, CXCL13, CCL22,

 and CD163) factors at 1 week after stroke. Similarly, Hu et al.
(2012) showed that expression of both proinflammatory and
anti-inflammatory makers in the ischemic hemisphere peaks at
�5 d after stroke. Because we analyzed whole-hemisphere ho-
mogenates, the cellular origins could not be determined. How-
ever, MDMs and microglia most likely constituted the main
source of the observed gene expression, although minor contri-
butions from neurons and astrocytes cannot be excluded. At 7 d
after stroke, the number of activated microglia was more than
fourfold higher than the number of MDMs, and �80% of
microglia exhibited proinflammatory activity. At the same time
point, the number of MDMs with proinflammatory and anti-
inflammatory profiles were similar. These findings suggest that
the increased expression of genes encoding for proinflammatory
activities at 1 week after stroke can be attributed mostly to micro-
glia, whereas the changes in anti-inflammatory gene expression is
mainly in MDMs. In accordance, depletion of circulating mono-
cytes during the first week after stroke lead to reduced expression
predominantly of anti-inflammatory genes (Ym1, TGF�, and
CD163). Interestingly, these three genes have been upregulated in
response to stroke at days 3 and 7 (Ym1), only at day 7 (CD163),
or at days 7 and 14 (TGF�).
The ablation of circulating monocytes in the early phase after
stroke apparently did not influence the size of the lesion at 18
weeks after insult. Thus, it is very likely, based on the MC-21
monocyte-depletion experiment, that the effect of the MDMs
with a bias toward anti-inflammatory activity on recovery is not
mediated through neuroprotection but by creating an immuno-
logical microenvironment that supports tissue remodeling. In
agreement with our findings, poststroke chronic treatment with
the adenosine 5�-monophosphate-activated protein kinase acti-
vator metformin promoted functional recovery and tissue repair
via an anti-inflammatory-polarization mechanism after experi-
mental stroke without affecting ischemic lesion volume (Jin et al.,
2014). This treatment resulted in fewer cells immunopositive to
anti-inflammatory markers, such as CD32 and IL-1�, and in-
creased numbers of cells expressing anti-inflammatory markers,
such as CD206, Arginase 1, and IL-10. Metformin treatment also
stimulated angiogenesis and induced increased numbers of dou-
blecortin � neuroblasts in the subventricular zone.
Among the MDM-related anti-inflammatory factors contrib-
uting to long-term spontaneous recovery after stroke is TGF�1,
which was reported to be involved in the action of MDMs during
the first days after stroke for maintaining the integrity of the
neurovascular unit (Gliem et al., 2012). Based on our findings, it
seems possible that TGF�1 could play an important role also in
mediating the long-term effects of MDMs on recovery. Other
studies have demonstrated increased expression of TGF�
(Lehrmann et al., 1998; Martinez et al., 2001; Doyle et al., 2010;
Pa
´l et al., 2012) and its receptor (Pa
´l et al., 2014) after stroke,
mostly in macrophages (Lehrmann et al., 1998; Martinez et al.,
2001; Doyle et al., 2010). TGF� has been shown to suppress ex-
cessive neuroinflammation during the subacute phase after brain
ischemia, as evidenced by decreased expression of the proinflam-
matory microglia/macrophage markers CD68 and iNOS (Ceka-
naviciute et al., 2014), and is also able to directly inhibit LPS-
mediated activation of microglia (Kim et al., 2004; Le et al., 2004).
Zhou et al. (2012) recently demonstrated that TGF� enhances
IL-4-induced alternative activation of microglia by strongly in-
creasing the expression of Ym1. TGF� also contributes to post-
stroke neurogenesis from the subventricular zone and functional
recovery in neurological tests (Ma et al., 2008). Together, our
findings provide strong evidence that the decreased TGF� ex-
pression in the ischemic brain after MC-21 treatment could con-
tribute to the impaired functional recovery.
Another anti-inflammatory factor, which was downregulated
after monocyte depletion, is CD163, a phagocytic marker func-
tioning as a membrane-bound scavenger receptor for clearing the
extracellular haptoglobin–hemoglobin complex (Schaer et al.,
2007). It has immunoregulatory function and is associated with
Figure 9.
Depletion of circulating monocytes preferentially reduces anti-inflammatory factor expression in stroke-injured brain. A, Quantitative PCR showing decreased expression of anti-

 resolution of inflammation, which is important for functional
recovery after stroke (Clark et al., 1993). The mechanisms of
poststroke resolution are not fully understood (Shichita et al.,
2014), but our findings raise the possibility that alterations in the
resolution of inflammation, secondary to decreased CD163 level,
could be involved in the impaired recovery after stroke.
Finally, the MC-21 treatment caused decreased expression of
Ym1, an established marker for alternative activation of micro-
glia/macrophages (Chang et al., 2001; Nio et al., 2004). Ym1 is a
heparin/heparin sulfate-binding lectin that is expressed tran-
siently during inflammation (Hung et al., 2002). Although its
precise functions remain elusive, Ym1 has been suggested to be
involved in tissue remodeling and regulation of inflammation
(Giannetti et al., 2004). If this is the case, Ym1 may contribute to
poststroke functional recovery.
Our findings reveal a critical role of the MDMs infiltrating to the
injuredbrainearlyaftertheinsultinthelong-termfunctionalrecov-
ery after stroke. The transition of MDMs from proinflammatory to
anti-inflammatory bias during the first 3 weeks after ischemia leads
to modulation of the inflammatory tissue environment and is asso-
ciated with improved functional outcome. This new insight could
have important therapeutic implications by raising the possibility
that inadequate recruitment of MDMs after stroke underlies the
incomplete functional recovery seen in both animals and patients.
Future studies will show whether this physiological repair mecha-
nism can be potentiated by increasing the homing of macrophages,
derived from endogenous or grafted monocytes in the peripheral
blood, to the ischemically injured brain.
