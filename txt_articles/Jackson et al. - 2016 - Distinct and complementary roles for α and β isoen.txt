BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
We investigated the hypothesis that elevated glucose increases contractile responses in vascular smooth muscle and that this
enhanced constriction occurs due to the glucose-induced PKC-dependent inhibition of voltage-gated potassium channels.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH
Patch-clamp electrophysiology in rat isolated mesenteric arterial myocytes was performed to investigate the glucose-induced
inhibition of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) current. To determine the effects of glucose in whole vessel, wire myography was
performed in rat mesenteric, porcine coronary and human internal mammary arteries.
KEY RESULTS
Glucose-induced inhibition of Kv was PKC-dependent and could be pharmacologically dissected using PKC isoenzyme-specific
inhibitors to reveal a PKCβ-dependent component of Kv inhibition dominating between 0 and 10 mM glucose with an additional
PKCα-dependent component becoming evident at concentrations greater than 10 mM. These findings were supported using
wire myography in all artery types used, where contractile responses to vessel depolarization and vasoconstrictors were enhanced
by increasing bathing glucose concentration, again with evidence for distinct and complementary PKCα/PKCβ-mediated
components.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
Our results provide compelling evidence that glucose-induced PKCα/PKCβ-mediated inhibition of Kv current in vascular smooth
muscle causes an enhanced constrictor response. Inhibition of Kv current causes a significant depolarization of vascular myocytes
leading to marked vasoconstriction. The PKC dependence of this enhanced constrictor response may present a potential thera-
peutic target for improving microvascular perfusion following percutaneous coronary intervention after myocardial infarction in
hyperglycaemic patients.

 Introduction
In arterial and arteriolar vessels, hyperglycaemia can mediate
changes in both endothelial and smooth muscle cells, leading
to changes in blood vessel diameter, BP and vascular dysfunc-
tion (Hink et al., 2001; Arun et al., 2004; Zamami et al., 2008).
Significant fluctuations in plasma glucose concentration also
occur physiologically through the diurnal cycle of feeding
and fasting, and such changes can be exaggerated under cer-
tain pathophysiological circumstances (e.g. type 1 or type 2
diabetes). According to NICE guidelines, diabetes is often as-
sociated with cardiovascular complications, including coro-
nary artery disease (leading to myocardial infarction and
angina), peripheral artery disease (leg claudication and gan-
grene) and carotid artery disease (strokes and dementia).
There are also microvascular complications caused by diabe-
tes, such as diabetic retinopathy, kidney and nerve damage
(NICE guidelines, 2014). Recent evidence suggests that the
plasma concentration of blood glucose may also play a
significant role in enhancing vasoconstriction and so have a
deleterious effect on microvascular reperfusion following per-
cutaneous coronary intervention (Iwakura et al., 2003). The
risk associated with these complications can be minimized
by tight glycaemic control, although there is a need for ther-
apies to reduce the risk further. Acute hyperglycaemia
(15 mM), in healthy human subjects, increases systolic and
diastolic BP and heart rate and decreases leg blood flow and
blood viscosity (Giugliano et al., 1997). Such acute glycaemic
changes can cause rapid changes in vascular physiology,
including alterations to ‘resting’ intracellular calcium con-
centration ([Ca2+]i) (Dunn and Nelson, 2010; V
elmurugan
and White, 2012), DAG levels (Lee et al., 1989; Miele et al.,
2007;
Descorbeth
and
Anand-Srivastava,
2008),
PKC
localization/activity (Das Evcimen and King, 2007; Geraldes
and King, 2010) and the generation of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) (Tesfamariam and Cohen, 1992; Inoguchi
et al., 2000; Hink et al., 2001).
In arterial smooth muscle, increases in glucose concentra-
tion often lead to vasoconstriction (Das Evcimen and King,
2007). We (Rainbow et al., 2006) and others (Li et al., 2003;
Straub et al., 2009) have previously shown that this acute
hyperglycaemic effect involves modulation of a voltage-gated
potassium channel (Kv) conductance, which is a key determi-
nant of membrane potential and vascular tone (Chen et al.,
2006b; Rainbow et al., 2006). This change in vascular tone
occurred in vessels, or cells, isolated from a normoglycaemic
animal with no reported diabetes. These findings demonstrate
an effect of the elevated glucose concentration per se rather than
a diabetes-related change in contractile behaviour.
V
asoconstrictors modulate Kv through PKC isoenzymes
(Rainbow et al., 2009), and there is accruing experimental
evidence to support the proposition that glucose can also
utilize this signal transduction mechanism (Lee et al., 1989;
Miele et al., 2007; Descorbeth and Anand-Srivastava, 2008).
Such constriction may occur via a number of locally and
somatically
released
constrictor
mediators,
such
as
endothelin-1 (ET1) (Tamareille et al., 2013), neuropeptide Y
(Clarke et al., 1987), 5-HT (McFadden et al., 1991) and angio-
tensin II (A
TII) (Arun et al., 2004).
In the present study, we have addressed this hypothesis by
investigating the link between acute elevations in glucose
concentration and changes in vascular function. W
e present
data
demonstrating
for
the
first
time
that
a
glucose
concentration-dependent increase in vessel contraction is
mediated by the DAG- and Ca2+-sensitive PKCα and PKCβ
isoenzymes, as also recently shown in cardiomyocytes (Sims
et al., 2014). This mechanism appears to be common to rat
mesentery, porcine coronary and human internal mammary
arterial tissues. Crucially, we have shown that increases in glu-
cose concentration within, or just beyond the normal physio-
logical range, can significantly inhibit Kv current amplitude
(Rainbow et al., 2006) and also alter the modulatory actions of
vasoconstrictors, such as TxA2, UTP and A
TII (Nobe et al.,
2003, 2008; Arun et al., 2004; Ghatta and Ramarao, 2004). A
glucose concentration-dependent, PKC-mediated modulation
of Kv current provides a novel mechanism by which glucose
can acutely modulate vasoconstriction within the physiologi-
cal and pathophysiological glycaemic range. Such glucose-
induced constriction of vessels may provide a mechanism to
help explain the worsened prognosis after acute myocardial
infarction in patients with varying degrees of hyperglycaemia.

 isoenzymes may pinpoint a therapeutic target for improving
coronary microvascular perfusion in the heart after percutane-
ous coronary intervention and so potentially improve progno-
sis after acute myocardial infarction, improve perfusion in
retinopathy and also improve systemic perfusion of the
extremities.
Methods
Group sizes
For all experiments, the group size is provided in the corre-
sponding figure legend. For myography experiments, the
number of vessels and animals is reported, while for whole
cell electrophysiological recordings, the number of cells and
animals is reported.
Randomization
All rats used in this study were adult male Wistar rats bred
in-house
at
the
University
of
Leicester.
Animals
were
provided when they reached an appropriate size (over
300 g), and the researchers in this study had no input into
the selection of animals.
Blinding
Experiments were not blinded in this study as the experi-
menter was responsible on each day for the cell preparation,
solution making and analysis of each completed data set. To
reduce any experimental bias, or anomalous results due to er-
rors in experiments, only one cell (electrophysiology), or one
pair of vessels (myography), was recorded from in 1 day for
each data set. From previous experience with electrophysiol-
ogy, in particular investigating changes in Kv current in the
presence of glucose (Rainbow et al., 2006), it was calculated
that six cells would be required for each data set. Data analysis
was not performed until the complete data set had been
collected to reduce experimental bias, and no complete
recording was excluded. Similarly, duplicate data from three
to four animals were required for myography experiments.
Normalization
Electrophysiology data in this study were normalized by two
methods. (i) Data were normalized to maximum in control
(normalized to 1). This allowed repeated measurements to
be readily compared between cells within a data set. (ii) Data
were normalized to cell capacitance in some experiments.
Normalizing
to
cell
capacitance
allows
comparison
of
currents by normalizing to cell size. Myography data were
expressed as mN and normalized to the vessel diameter to
allow
comparison
of
contraction
between
arteries
of
different sizes.
Statistical comparison
All statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism 6
(GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA); the statistical
test used for each data set is reported in figure legends. Stu-
dent’s paired or unpaired t-test and one-way or two-way
ANOV
Awith Bonferroni’s post test were performed as indicated
in the text. Significance was set at P < 0.05. The data and
statistical analysis comply with British Journal of Pharmacol-
ogy guidelines (Curtis et al., 2015).
Validity of animal species or model selection
Adult male Wistar rats have been widely used in the literature
as a source of vascular tissue. The peptide-based PKC inhibi-
tor peptides were rat PKC isoform-specific. The detailed
electrophysiological and myography experiments would not
have been possible in other species.
Finally, the validity of the data gathered in the rat model
was confirmed by using porcine coronary arteries and human
internal mammary arteries. These findings confirmed the
same phenotypic findings in the rat.
Ethical statement
Rats were culled by stunning and cervical dislocation. The
care and schedule 1 killing of animals conformed to the
requirements of the United Kingdom Animals (Scientific Pro-
cedures) Act 1986 Amendment Regulations (SI 2012/3039).
The ARRIVE guidelines for reporting experiments involving
animals (Kilkenny et al., 2010; McGrath and Lilley, 2015)
have been followed in this study. Human participants pro-
vided written, informed consent prior to tissue collection
covered by the National Research Ethics Service (NHS) Ethics
Committee approved study for the University of Leicester
Hospitals
entitled
‘Sample
and
Data
Collection
For
Cardiovascular Research’. All was carried out in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Animals
Adult male Wistar animals (300–400 g) were used in this
study. Porcine hearts for isolation of coronary arteries were
sourced from a local abattoir.
Experimental procedures
All animals were culled using a schedule 1 procedure, stun-
ning and cervical dislocation, that does not require prior an-
aesthesia. No in vivo experiments were carried out in this
study, only animal-excised tissue. Porcine coronary arteries
were isolated from hearts collected from a local abattoir.
Human internal mammary artery was collected from patients
undergoing coronary bypass surgery.
Housing and husbandry
Rats are maintained in 1800 cm2 Tecniplast cages, using
BED01/8 Datesand corn cob for bedding, housed in IVC
caging (SPF free). The number of cage companions for the rats
of size of 300–400 g is 5 based on a calculation of 350 cm2
being required for each rat of that size.
Interpretation
We have used the minimum possible animals to achieve
statistical significance.

arteries
(600–1500 μm) were cut into 1.4 mm length rings and
mounted in a Mulvany–Halpern wire myograph (Danish
Myo-Technology, Aarhus, Denmark) and maintained at a
constant temperature of 37°C. After normalization, vessels
were maintained at a tension equivalent to 90 mmHg and left
to equilibrate in the test glucose solution for 30 min before
experimentation.
Solutions
and
vasoconstrictors
were
applied as indicated in the example traces provided in the
figures. L-NAME (20 μM) was included in all myography
solutions unless stated otherwise. Data were normalized to
tension after calibration. All vessels were incubated in the test
glucose concentration for 30 min before experimentation
unless otherwise indicated.
Patch-clamp electrophysiology
Mesenteric arterial smooth muscle cells (MASMCs) were iso-
lated as described previously (Rainbow et al., 2006, 2009)
and maintained on ice in 5 mM glucose (0.1 mM Ca2+) solu-
tion until use. Currents were recorded in the conventional
whole-cell recording configuration. Isolated MASMCs were
allowed to adhere to a glass coverslip mounted on a heated
perfusion system for 15 min in a 0 mM glucose extracellular
solution at 32 ± 2°C also containing penitrem A (100 nM) to
limit BKCa channel interference. MASMCs were voltage
clamped at �65 mVin the whole-cell ruptured patch configura-
tion, and an initial current–voltage relationship (I/V(1)) was
recorded. After 9 min of perfusion with the test glucose
concentration, a second I/V was recorded (I/V(2)) and expressed
as a fraction of that in 0 mM glucose [I/V(2)/I/V(1)]. For
experiments with cell-permeant Tat peptide-linked PKC
isoenzyme-specific
inhibitor
peptides,
cells
were
pre-
incubated for 15 min in 0 mM glucose solution with
100 nM Tat-PKC inhibitor. Pharmacological inhibitors Gö
6976 (PKCα/β inhibitor) and L
Y379196 (PKCβ-selective inhib-
itor, a gift from Eli Lilly & Co., Indianapolis, IN, USA) (Wen
et al., 2003) were used at 300 nM and pre-incubated with
the
tissue
for
10
min
before
other
experimental
manipulations. Concentration–response data were calculated
from the fraction of current remaining after 9 min of perfu-
sion with the test glucose at +60 mV [from I/V(2)] compared
with current at +60 mV in the control I/V (0 mM glucose). In
all electrophysiological recordings, the current was taken
from the final 50 ms of the depolarizing step (protocol shown
in Figure 1).
Solutions.
All
myography
solutions
were
based
on
the
following solution; in mM, 135 NaCl, 6 KCl, 10 HEPES, 1.2
MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, 20 total monosaccharide (e.g. 5 glucose + 15
mannitol), pH 7.4 (adjusted with NaOH). Zero-Ca2+ solution
was as above with the omission of CaCl2. High K+ solution
(60 mM; 60K) was as above except with 81 NaCl and 60 KCl.
Bathing solutions for electrophysiology were as above with
30 mM total monosaccharide (e.g. 5 glucose + 25 mannitol)
and 0.1 CaCl2. Pipette solution contained, in mM, 140 K+ (30
KOH and 110 KCl), 10 EGT
A, 10 HEPES, 1 A
TP
, 0.5 GTP
, 1
MgCl2 and 3.92 CaCl2 (equivalent to 100 nM free Ca2+). All
chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Poole, UK)
unless stated otherwise.

Stock solutions
of Gö 6976 and L
Y379196 (1 mM in DMSO) were diluted to
the test concentration in the appropriate bathing solutions.
DMSO concentration was never greater than 0.1%, which
had no effect on the intact vessels, or in isolated MASMC
patch clamp, experiments when applied (data not shown).
L-NAME, A
TII, ET1, UTP
, and the Tx-mimetic U46619 (Tocris
Bioscience, Bristol, UK) were dissolved in the appropriate
bathing solution as stock solutions and diluted to the
appropriate concentration indicated in the example traces
seen in the figures. PKC isoenzyme-selective, cell-permeant
and Tat peptide-linked inhibitor peptides were used as
previously described, pre-incubated for 30 min before use at
a concentration of 100 nM (Rainbow et al., 2009; Sims et al.,
2014; Brennan et al., 2015).

Results
Kv current inhibited by extracellular glucose in
a biphasic manner
We (Rainbow et al., 2006), and others (Li et al., 2003; Straub
et al., 2009), have reported that glucose inhibits the Kv cur-
rent in freshly isolated smooth muscle cells. Initial experi-
ments in this study were performed to further characterize
the glucose-induced inhibition of the Kv current. Extracellu-
lar glucose inhibited Kv current in freshly isolated rat MASMC
in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 1A, panels ii
and iii, and B). Further to this, there was a glucose concentra-
tion rightward shift in the voltage dependence of activation

 calculated from the tail current (Figure 1C, �11.5 ± 0.8 vs.
�5.6 ± 0.6 mV in 0 and 20 mM glucose respectively,
P < 0.001). This inhibitory response of increasing extracellu-
lar glucose was most accurately modelled by a two-site analy-
sis (IC50
H 4.9 ± 0.7 mM; IC50
L 16.2 ± 1.1 mM), indicative of a
biphasic response, with a maximal inhibitory effect on Kv
current of around 50% (Figure 1D). Kv inhibition by increas-
ing extracellular glucose concentration resulted in graded
depolarization of membrane potential (Figure 1E, P < 0.001
at 20 mM glucose).
Glucose-mediated inhibition of Kv current is
attenuated by inhibition of Ca2+/DAG-
sensitive PKC isoenzymes
We have recently reported that glucose causes action poten-
tial prolongation, presumably via Kv inhibition, via conven-
tional PKCs in freshly isolated cardiomyocytes (Sims et al.,
2014). To determine if a similar mechanism occurs in vascular
smooth muscle, we investigated the role of PKC in glycaemic
modulation of the Kv current in MASMCs. Initial experiments
used the PKC inhibitor, Tat-PKC 20-28 peptide, which was

 (300 nM), or a combination of two isoenzyme-specific pep-
tide inhibitors Tat-PKCα and Tat-PKCβ (Figure 2D–F). Both
small molecule and peptide inhibitors caused a complete re-
versal of current suppression by high (20 mM) glucose and re-
versed the shift in the voltage dependence of activation
(Figure 2E). In contrast, treatment with Tat-PKCδ or Tat-PKCε
inhibitory peptides was without effect (Figure 2D). High
glucose-induced
membrane
depolarization
was
also
abolished by combined inhibition by Tat-PKCα plus Tat-
PKCβ, or Gö 6976 (Figure 2F). These data suggest that the
PKCα and β isoenzymes are responsible for the inhibition of
the Kv current imparted by high glucose in MASMCs.
Dissecting the contribution of PKCα and β
To determine the relative contributions of PKCα and β to the
Kv current inhibition caused by glucose, electrophysiological
experiments were performed using Tat-PKCα or Tat-PKCβ. The
Tat-PKCβ inhibitor peptide completely prevented the sup-
pression of Kv current by glucose concentrations below
10 mM but not by higher glucose concentrations (Figure 3A,
C and E). In the presence of Tat-PKCβ, increasing extracellular
glucose caused a monophasic inhibition of Kv current (IC50
16.3 ± 1.8 mM; Figure 3E). The Tat-PKCα peptide also caused
a monophasic inhibition of current. Conversely to Tat-PKCβ,
Tat-PKCα only prevented the current suppression at glucose
concentrations above 10 mM (IC50 4.9 ± 1.3 mM; Figure 3F).
These data suggest that PKCα and β play distinct and comple-
mentary roles in the actions of glucose on Kv current with
PKCβ modulating activity between 0 and 10 mM and PKCα
modulating the current between 10 and ~20 mM.
Effect of extracellular glucose concentration on
arterial contractility
Myography experiments were performed to determine the ef-
fect of high glucose on contraction. The contractile response
of rat mesenteric arteries to addition of 60 mM K+ (60K) in-
creased (by ≥30%) when extracellular glucose concentration
was raised from 5 to 20 mM (Figure 4A and B). Additionally,
there was a significant increase in the Ca2+ response to 60K
concomitantly with tension in isolated vessels loaded with
Fura-2 (Supporting Information Fig. S1). Consistent with
our previous findings of the reversible nature of the Kv cur-
rent inhibition by elevated glucose (Rainbow et al., 2006),
an initial application of 60K in 20 mM glucose, followed by
washout with 5 mM glucose, yielded a smaller second 60K re-
sponse (Figure 4C).
Using 125 mM K+ (125K) to abolish the K+ gradient
completely, the effects of 20 mM glucose were investigated
using the same protocol; 125K abolished the potentiation of
contraction in 20 mM glucose, demonstrating that in 60K
there remains a small hyperpolarizing K+ flux that can be
modulated by glucose, presumably with PKC dependence
(Supporting Information Fig. S2). In the absence of a com-
plete molecular characterization of Kv expression in MASMC,
the Kv1-family channel blocker Psora-4 (Marzian et al., 2013)
was used to probe the contribution of Kvs. Pre-incubation
with the Kv1-inhibitor Psora-4 enhanced the vasoconstrictor
response to 60K in 5 mM glucose, and no further increase
was observed when glucose concentration was raised from 5
to 20 mM. Furthermore, Psora-4 (100 nM) elicited a marked
inhibition of Kv and membrane depolarization, confirming
a substantial role for Kv1 subunits as components of the
voltage-gated
K+
current
seen
in
MASMC
(control,
�49 ± 2 mV; +Psora-4, �25 ± 2 mV). Together, these findings
suggest that inhibition of channels containing Kv1-family
subunits plays a role in the enhanced vasoconstrictor re-
sponse to depolarization after acute treatment with high
glucose.
Consistent with our previous findings (Rainbow et al.,
2006), replacement of D-glucose with non-metabolizable L-
glucose did not yield a potentiation of contractile response af-
ter incubation with 20 mM L-glucose. Furthermore, replace-
ment of extracellular glucose with fructose (20 mM) yielded
a potentiated second 60K response (Supporting Information
Fig. S3), consistent with a glycolytic metabolism-dependent
mechanism.
The enhanced vasoconstriction and Ca2+ response to 60K
in rat mesenteric arteries exposed to 20 mM glucose were
abolished by the DAG/Ca2+-dependent PKC inhibitor Gö
6976 (Figure 4D–E and Supporting Information Fig. S1).
These data suggest that the response imparted by high extra-
cellular
glucose
is
mediated
via
conventional
PKC
isoenzymes.
Glucose-mediated enhancement of
depolarization-induced vasoconstriction is
reversed by selective PKCα and PKCβ inhibition
Tat-PKCα and β peptides were used to determine the relative
contributions of PKCα and β, respectively, to the enhanced
contraction caused by high glucose in the presence of 60K.
At
an
intermediate
glucose
concentration
(10
mM),
isoenzyme-selective PKCα inhibition had no effect, while
PKCβ inhibition completely abolished the enhanced contrac-
tion (Figure 4F). At a higher glucose concentration (20 mM),
selective PKCα or PKCβ inhibition each partially prevented
the enhanced constriction, which was abolished in the pres-
ence of both inhibitors (Figure 4F). These contractile data
are in accordance with the electrophysiological data shown
in
Figure
3.
Combined,
these
findings
suggest
that
DAG/Ca2+-dependent PKC isoenzymes play distinct and
complementary roles in the actions of glucose on rat mesen-
teric artery contraction with PKCβ modulating activity be-
tween 0 and 10 mM and PKCα modulating the contraction
between 10 and ~20 mM.
Contractile response to angiotensin II, but not
endothelin-1, is enhanced by elevated glucose
and attenuated by selective PKCα or PKCβ

To investigate if elevated glucose concentrations could alter
the contractile response to vasoconstrictors, A
TII and ET1
were applied to rat mesenteric arteries in the presence of 5
and 20 mM glucose. In rat mesenteric arteries, increasing ex-
tracellular glucose concentration to 20 mM markedly en-
hanced (by ~2.5 mN·mm�1) the vasoconstrictor response to

 observed by increasing glucose concentration from 10 to
20 mM (Figure 5F). These data are consistent with high glu-
cose and ET1 both exerting their contractile effects through
PKCα and so showing no further potentiation of contraction
at glucose concentrations greater than 10 mM. This was sup-
ported by experiments investigating Kv current inhibition by
A
TII and ET1 in rat MASMC in 20 mM glucose, where A
TII was
able
to
further
inhibit
the
current,
whereas
ET1
was
ineffective (Supporting Information Fig. S4). Additionally,
the enhanced contractile responses in the presence of
20 mM glucose of rat mesenteric arteries to UTP and
U46619 were also prevented by Gö 6976 (Supporting
Information
Fig.
S5).
Despite
there
being
a
common
glucose-induced PKC-mediated enhancement of vasocon-
strictor activity, the PKA-dependent dilatory pathway, via β-
adrenoceptor stimulation, was unaffected by elevated glucose
(Supporting Information Fig. S6). Collectively, these data sug-
gest that there is a common mechanism by which enhanced
concentrations of glucose cause inhibition of Kv current,
membrane depolarization, calcium influx and contraction.
Glucose-mediated PKC-dependent
enhancement of vasoconstriction in porcine
coronary and human internal mammary
arteries
To assess the generality of these findings, similar experiments
were performed in porcine coronary arteries (Figure 6) and
human internal mammary arteries (Figure 7). These data
from porcine coronary and human internal mammary
arteries were analogous to the findings in rat mesenteric arter-
ies. In both vascular beds, the contractile response to 60K
(Figure 6A and B and Figure 7A and B) was increased in the
presence of elevated glucose. There was no further enhance-
ment of ET1 porcine coronary vasoconstrictor activity above
10 mM extracellular glucose (Figure 6C). ET1 contractions
were abolished in porcine coronary arteries by PKC inhibi-
tion with Gö 6976 but not with the selective PKCβ inhibitor
L
Y379196 (300 nM) (Figure 6A, panels iii and iv, and C). This
further supports the predominantly PKCα-mediated mecha-
nism of action reported for this vasoconstrictor (Rainbow
et al., 2009). Contractions of porcine coronary arteries and
human internal mammary arterioles induced by U46619
(Figure 6D and E and Figure 7D and E) were markedly en-
hanced in high extracellular glucose. For each contractile
stimulus tested on porcine coronary and human internal
mammary arterioles, the presence of Gö 6976 prevented the
enhanced contraction caused by high glucose (Figure 6B, C
and F and Figure 7B, C and F). Selective PKCβ inhibition
(L
Y379196; 300 nM) also decreased the magnitude of contrac-
tion to each contractile stimulus tested. The data collected
from these three different vascular beds (across three different
species) suggest that PKCα- and PKCβ-mediated enhance-
ment of contractions by high extracellular glucose is a com-
mon mechanism throughout the cardiovascular system.
Discussion
We have presented novel experimental data indicating that
acute changes in extracellular glucose concentration within
the physiological/pathophysiological range increase basal tone
and vasoconstrictor responses in small arteries from three
different species. This occurs through glucose concentration-
dependent recruitment of conventional PKC activities and
modulation of specific K+ currents. In particular, we report that
acutely increasing extracellular glucose concentration leads to a
biphasic inhibition of the voltage-gated K+ current and
membrane depolarization. In addition, this inhibitory effect
on Kv is dependent on at least two DAG/Ca2+-dependent PKC
isoenzymes, with PKCβ playing a key role at lower glucose
concentrations (≤10 mM) and the PKCα isoenzyme contribut-
ing at higher glucose concentrations. Furthermore, we demon-
strate that this glucose-mediated PKC isoenzyme-dependent
inhibition of Kv results in increased vascular tone and increased
vasoconstrictor responsiveness through a mechanism that is
conserved across a number of different vasoconstrictors, species
and vascular beds.
Previous reports have shown that inhibition of the Kv
current occurs within minutes of elevating extracellular glu-
cose (Li et al., 2003; Rainbow et al., 2006; Straub et al.,
2009). We hypothesized that increasing glucose concentra-
tion causes activation of PKC isoenzymes leading to inhibi-
tion of the Kv current, presumably by phosphorylation of
Kv subunits. The exact molecular identity of the Kv current
in arterial smooth muscle is complex and currently unclear
making direct measurement of subunit phosphorylation dif-
ficult; however, a number of subunits have been identified,
with particular importance being placed on the Kv1 family
(Knot and Nelson, 1995; Cole et al., 1996; Albarwani et al.,
2003). Indeed, our data using Psora-4 (Marzian et al., 2013;
Wulff and Y
arov-Y
arovoy, 2013), and previous findings by
others using Kv1.5 dominant-negative channel subunits
(Chen et al., 2006a), indicate an important role for this Kv
family subgroup in vasoregulation. A number of other Kv
subtypes have been described in systemic vascular smooth
muscle, including Kv2, 4 and 7 (Ko et al., 2008; Stott et al.,
2014). Given the hetero-multimerization possible within
expressed Kv complexes, a role for other Kv subfamilies
cannot be ruled out.
Elevated glucose concentration is known to increase
cellular levels of the endogenous PKC activator, DAG in a va-
riety of tissues, including arterial smooth muscle (Inoguchi
et al., 1994; Nobe et al., 2003, 2004). The increase in DAG con-
centration provides a potential mechanism for glucose-
induced
PKC
activation,
specifically
activation
of
the
DAG/Ca2+-dependent isoenzymes PKCα and PKCβ. Basal
cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations have also been reported to
increase in rat tail artery smooth muscle cells across a similar
range of extracellular glucose concentrations (5–20 mM) to
that used in the present study (Barbagallo et al., 1995). How-
ever, we did not observe an increase in basal Ca2+ in whole
vessels during 30 min incubation with solution containing
20 mM glucose. However, we did not observe an increase in
basal Ca2+ in whole vessels during 30 min incubation with so-
lution containing 20 mM glucose. Despite this, there was a
small constriction in response to the increased glucose during
this time (0.95 ± 0.13 mN·mm�1). It is plausible that any
changes in intracellular basal Ca2+ were too small to be de-
tected by the recording system used. Additionally, there may
be a glucose-induced PKC-dependent sensitization of con-
tractile machinery giving a small constrictor response for

 little or no apparent increase in [Ca2+]i. Further to this, Kvs are
one component of the hyperpolarizing response to depolariza-
tion that limits Ca2+ influx. BKCa channels, sensitive to both in-

could act to limit constrictor responses in the short term with a

 seem likely that an enhanced Ca2+ influx can account for this el-
evated Ca2+ response, consistent with our hypothesis of a re-
duced Kv current. Reducing the Kv-induced hyperpolarizing
current, resulting in further depolarization, would enhance L-
type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel activity.

mediated

is evident at higher glucose concentrations. The importance
of
these
signal
transduction
mechanisms
is
further
emphasized by assessment of the response to specific
vasoconstrictors with known mechanisms of action. The
potentiation of vasoconstrictor responsiveness in the pres-
ence of increased extracellular glucose occurs via additive
PKCα- plus PKCβ-dependent mechanisms (Figure 8). For ex-
ample, the glucose-induced PKCβ- and PKCα-mediated mech-
anism leads to further vasoconstriction of A
TII, a primarily
PKCε-dependent pathway, revealing the additive effect of
the different PKC isoenzymes on Kv current inhibition and
vasoconstriction. These findings of enhanced PKCα- and
PKCβ-dependent vasoconstriction in high glucose are seen
consistently using other vasoconstrictors, such as U46619
in porcine coronary and UTP in rat mesenteric arteries.
Hence, it appears that glucose-mediated PKC-dependent
inhibition of the Kv current not only increases basal tone
but also potentiates vasoconstrictor response to G-protein-
activated

pathways,

as
(60K)
depolarization-induced vasoconstriction. In contrast, the
glucose-mediated potentiation of ET1-induced vasoconstric-
tion, a predominantly PKCα-dependent pathway (Rainbow
et al., 2009), is only observed in the 5–10 mM (PKCβ-depen-
dent) range, with no increase in vasoconstrictor activity seen
in the 10–20 mM (PKCα-dependent) range. In summary, the
glucose-mediated potentiation of constriction is greater for
agonists that do not act via PKCβ or PKCα (e.g. A
TII) compared
with agonists that constrict via PKCβ or PKCα (e.g. ET1).
In contrast to a previous study in rat coronary arteries
(Li et al., 2003), we also provide experimental evidence that
high glucose-induced DAG/Ca2+-dependent PKC-Kv-medi-
ated potentiation of vasoconstriction does not significantly
alter the vasodilator activity of the β-adrenoceptor agonist,
isoprenaline (Supporting Information Fig. S6).
Our previous findings, and our current data in isolated
MASMCs, give added credence to our hypothesis that there
is a direct effect of glucose, or a glucose metabolite(s), on
PKC activation in vascular smooth muscle independent of
the endothelium. The electrophysiology data in this current
study and others (Li et al., 2003; Rainbow et al., 2006; Straub
et al., 2009) show that elevated glucose decreases Kv current
in isolated vascular smooth muscle cells. Furthermore, en-
hanced arterial contractility in elevated glucose was also
maintained in the presence of the NOS inhibitor, L-NAME.
This is a potentially important finding, as in hyperglycaemia
endothelial dysfunction has been hypothesized to reduce the
activity of NOS-dependent vasodilator pathways (Bohlen and
Nase, 2001; Beckman et al., 2002). Our data suggest that the

A representation of the proposed mechanism of glycaemia-enhanced vasoconstrictor signalling in vascular smooth muscle. Activation of PKCα
and PKCβ with increasing glucose has a cumulative inhibitory effect on the Kv current so enhancing vasoconstriction by depolarizing stimuli (such
as 60K), or enhancing contraction to ATII, which activates an alternate PKC isoenzyme. ET1-induced vasoconstriction is only potentiated by glu-
cose concentrations up to 10 mM, due to it acting via a PKCα-dependent pathway. The mechanism by which glucose activates PKC is currently
unclear with ROS generation, de novo DAG synthesis, or a presently unidentified endothelial-derived modulator being potential candidates.

 effects of acute hyperglycaemia occur independently of any
vascular endothelial dysfunction.
The involvement of ROS, and enhanced generation in
hyperglycaemic conditions, is a further potential mechanism
for altered signalling. In our previous study, however, use of a
free radical scavenger (N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)glycine) did
not have a significant effect on the glucose-induced inhibition
of Kv current in isolated MASMCs (Rainbow et al., 2006). How-
ever, in another study, the use of superoxide dismutase and cat-
alase partially reversed a high glucose-induced inhibition of Kv
current, suggesting a role for superoxide radicals (Liu et al.,
2001). In addition, ROS has been suggested to have effects on
other channels involved in vasoconstriction, including L-type
voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (Shaifta et al., 2015). In this re-
cently published study, the authors demonstrated an enhanced
vasoconstriction, and an enhanced Ca2+ current, in response to
ROS generation in a number of arterial beds, including mesen-
teric. Given that elevated glucose has been demonstrated to in-
crease ROS in vascular tissue, further investigations will be
required to characterize their effects on the enhanced constric-
tor responses seen in the present study and whether other cur-
rents are modulated by this pathway.
Acute elevations of extracellular glucose have also been
shown to have deleterious effects on the electrical properties of
isolated cardiomyocytes, causing a marked prolongation of ac-
tion potential duration (Hreiche et al., 2009) and subsequent
QT prolongation, which is suggested to be pro-arrhythmic
(Marfella et al., 2001; Gordin et al., 2008). Our own recent find-
ings suggest a similar DAG/Ca2+-PKC isoenzyme-dependent
dysregulation of electrical signalling in cardiac tissue (Sims
et al., 2014). The findings of the current study provide evidence
for a common potential mechanism through which elevated
glucose may exert direct deleterious effects on cardiovascular
function with similar DAG/Ca2+-PKC isoenzyme-dependent
mechanisms being evident in both heart and vasculature. The
present study also demonstrates that hyperglycaemia exacer-
bates vasoconstriction both directly and by exacerbating the re-
sponse to circulating vasoconstrictors.
Hyperglycaemia has been previously shown to cause
adverse effects on leg bloodflow (Giugliano et al., 1997).
Additionally, there is ample evidence that acute hypergly-
caemia is a predictor of poor outcome in several vascular dis-
eases, such as acute myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke
(Parsons et al., 2002) and vascular (mesenteric) ischaemia
(Schaffler et al., 1998). It is presently unclear whether acute
hyperglycaemia, observed under these conditions, has a
cause and effect relationship. The need for further research
into potential underlying mechanisms is clear; however, here
we provide compelling evidence that specific PKC isoen-
zymes are implicated in a process that could contribute to this
phenomenon. Our findings suggest the selective inhibition
of PKCα and PKCβ isoenzymes as a potential therapeutic tar-
get in patients with hyperglycaemia-complicating acute syn-
dromes, such as myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke.
In clinical practice, inhibition of both PKCα and PKCβ may
not be well tolerated, due to the ubiquitous expression and
multiple roles of these PKC isoenzymes (Serova et al., 2006;
Rosse et al., 2010). However, our demonstration of primarily
PKCβ isoenzymic involvement in Kv current modulation at
5–10 mM glucose, a level of hyperglycaemia associated with ad-
verse prognosis following acute myocardial infarction (Goyal
et al., 2006; Kosiborod et al., 2008; Squire et al., 2010), suggests
that PKCβ inhibition alone should have significant therapeutic
potential in this context. The PKCβ inhibitor ruboxistaurin
has been shown to be well tolerated in clinical trials for other
indications but has not to date been investigated in the
context of such cardiovascular indications (Idris and Donnelly,
2006; Geraldes and King, 2010). Therefore, isoenzyme-specific
PKC inhibition may represent a potential therapeutic target in
the
management
of
acute
syndromes
complicated
by
hyperglycaemia-potentiated vasoconstriction.

Figure S1 K+-induced increases in [Ca2+]i and vasoconstric-
tion are increased in the presence of high glucose and re-
versed by Gö6976. Isolated rat mesenteric arteries were
stimulated to contract by two applications of 60 mM KCl
(60K) separated by a 30 min washout period. Example traces
showing 60K(1) and a second response to 60K (60K(2)) after
30 min incubation in (A) 5 mM glucose, (B) 20 mM glucose
and (C) 20 mM glucose in the presence of the cPKC inhibitor
Gö6976 (300 nM) immediately after washout of the first 60K
addition. (D) Mean data showing increases in tension (mN/
mm) and Fura-2 ratio for 60K(2) relative to 60K(1) (%) and

of mesenteric arteries to 125K-induced contraction in 5 and
20 mM glucose. (G) Mean data showing a lack of potentiation
of the 125K-response in 20 mM glucose suggesting that the
