ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND Body mass index (BMI) is criticized for not distinguishing fat from lean mass and ignoring fat distri-
bution, leaving its ability to detect health effects unclear.
OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to compare BMI with total and regional fat indexes from dual-energy x-ray
absorptiometry in their associations with cardiometabolic traits. Duration of exposure to and change in each index across
adolescence were examined in relation to detailed traits in young adulthood.
METHODS BMI was examined alongside total, trunk, arm, and leg fat indexes (each in kilograms per square meter) from
dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at ages 10 and 18 years in relation to 230 traits from targeted metabolomics at age 18
years in 2,840 offspring from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children.
RESULTS Higher total fat mass index and BMI at age 10 years were similarly associated with cardiometabolic traits at age
18 years, including higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure, higher very low-density lipoprotein and low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol, lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, higher triglycerides, and higher insulin and glycoprotein
acetyls. Associations were stronger for both indexes measured at age 18 years and for gains in each index from age 10 to 18
years (e.g., 0.45 SDs [95% confidence interval: 0.38 to 0.53] in glycoprotein acetyls per SD unit gain in fat mass index
vs. 0.38 SDs [95% confidence interval: 0.27 to 0.48] per SD unit gain in BMI). Associations resembled those for trunk
fat index. Higher lean mass index was weakly associated with traits and was not protective against higher fat mass index.
CONCLUSIONS The results of this study support abdominal fatness as a primary driver of cardiometabolic dysfunction
and BMI as a useful tool for detecting its effects. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2018;72:3142–54) © 2018 The Authors. Published by

O
besity is a public health crisis with unabat-
ing rates worldwide (1). Fatness is most
commonly measured in populations using
body mass index (BMI), a simple ratio of weight to
squared height, because it is easily measured and
highly
correlated
with
more
objective
fat
mass
(2,3). Causal analyses support effects of higher BMI
on coronary heart disease (CHD) and its intermedi-
ates of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and remnant
cholesterol,
blood
pressure,
and
glucose
(4–6).

 Despite
this,
BMI
is
often
criticized
for
not distinguishing fat from lean mass and ignoring
fat distribution (7,8), which may limit its ability to
reveal true health effects.
Moderate positive correlations exist between total
fat and lean mass and between BMI and lean mass
(3,9), suggesting that true fat volume varies consid-
erably among subjects with high BMI. This variation
matters if body tissues have distinct effects on dis-
ease intermediates. For example, insulin resistance
and dyslipidemia may depend most on excessive fat
volume given adipocyte functions of lipolysis and
nonesterified fatty acid release (10,11), while hyper-
glycemia and inflammation may depend most on
insufficient lean volume given skeletal muscle func-
tions of glucose absorption and myokine release upon
contraction (12,13). These expectations are based on
small
laboratory-based
human
studies
(10,14)
or
epidemiological studies relating one-off measures of
fat and lean mass to either few metabolic traits among
many
participants
(15)
or
many
metabolic
traits
among few participants (16). Gains in fat and lean
mass are rarely examined, particularly in relation to
detailed cholesterol and triglyceride subtypes and
clinical trait precursors such as amino acids.
Fat stored centrally in the abdominal trunk region
most closely reflects metabolically active visceral fat
(17) and strongly influences CHD risk and its in-
termediates (18). Effects are often measured using
waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratio, with scant
evidence based on more objective trunk fat. Evi-
dence is also limited on the effects of peripheral fat.
Some studies suggest enhanced insulin sensitivity
and
reduced
inflammation
with
higher
leg
fat
(19,20), but prospective evidence is lacking. Impor-
tantly, the extent to which more objective measures
of total and regional fat offer insights into car-
diometabolic effects that are not detectable by sim-
ple BMI is unknown.
In this study, we compared BMI with total and
regional fat indexes from dual-energy x-ray absorp-
tiometry (DXA), a scan that isolates fat and lean tissue
from total body mass, in their associations with car-
diometabolic traits relevant to CHD. We used data
from
a
population-based
birth
cohort
study
to
examine duration of exposure to and change in each
index across adolescence in relation to detailed traits
from targeted metabolomics in young adulthood. We
also examined whether independent or interactive
associations exist between fat and lean mass in rela-
tion to these traits.
METHODS
STUDY
POPULATION. Data
were
from
offspring participants of ALSPAC (Avon Lon-
gitudinal Study of Parents and Children), a
population-based birth cohort study in which
14,541 pregnant women expected to deliver
between April 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992,
were recruited from southwestern England.
Offspring
who
were
alive
at
1
year
(n ¼ 13,988) have since been followed with
multiple assessments (21), with an additional
713 children enrolled over the course of the
study. Participant selection for analyses is
illustrated in Figure 1. Ethical approval was
obtained from the ALSPAC law and ethics and local
research ethics committees. Cohort details and data
descriptions are available online (22).
ASSESSMENT OF BMI AND DXA FAT INDEXES. Data
were collected on 2 occasions during clinical assess-
ments when participants were approximately 10 and
18 years of age. Height was measured in light clothing
without shoes to the nearest 0.1 cm using a Harpen-
den stadiometer. Weight was recorded to the nearest
0.1 kg using a Tanita scale. BMI was calculated as
weight (in kilograms) divided by the square of height
(in meters). Participants also underwent body scan-
ning with DXA using a Lunar Prodigy narrow fan-
beam densitometer from which total body fat mass
(in kilograms, excluding lean and bone mass) was
quantified. Trunk fat, arm fat, and leg fat (left and
right body sides combined) were also quantified.
Scans were screened for anomalies, motion, and ma-
terial artifacts and were realigned when necessary as
detailed elsewhere (23). Like BMI, fat indexes were
calculated as kilograms per square meter. Lean mass
index was also constructed in this way using total
DXA-derived lean mass.
ASSESSMENT OF CARDIOMETABOLIC TRAITS. Dur-
ing the 18-year clinic visit, systolic blood pressure
(SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were exam-
ined twice in succession while seated with the arm
supported using an appropriately sized cuff and a
DINAMAP 9301 device. Mean levels were then calcu-
lated. Fasting blood samples were drawn, from which
circulating insulin (milliunits per liter) and high-
sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) (milligrams per
liter) were quantified using routine chemistry assays.
Targeted
metabolomics
(proton
nuclear
magnetic
resonance spectroscopy [24]) was also performed to
quantify 230 cardiometabolic traits (150 concentra-
tions plus 80 ratios), including the concentration,

 diameter, and cholesterol and triglyceride content of
lipoprotein subclass particles, plus apolipoproteins,
fatty and amino acids, ketones, and factors related to
glycolysis and inflammation.
ASSESSMENT OF COVARIATES. Demographic cova-
riates included sex, ethnicity (white vs. nonwhite),
age (in months) at the time of fat index assessment,
and highest level of education attained by the par-
ticipant’s mother as reported shortly after delivery
(Certificate of Secondary Education, vocational, O-
level, A-level, or degree, using English standards) to
indicate socioeconomic position at birth. Smoking at
18
years
of
age
was
recorded
via
questionnaire
(grouped as never smoked an entire cigarette, smokes
less than weekly, and smokes every week). Alcohol
consumption at 18 years of age was also recorded
(grouped as never/monthly/less than monthly, 2 or 4
times per month, and 2 or more times per week).
Puberty timing was estimated through age at peak
height velocity, which describes the age at which the
greatest increase in height occurred on the basis of
superimposition by translation and rotation growth
curve modeling (25) of up to 10 (median 8) height
assessments
from
5
to
20
years
of
age
(Online
Appendix).
STATISTICAL
APPROACH. We
examined
Pearson
correlation coefficients for each index pairing at age
10 years, age 18 years, and change from ages 10 to 18
years. Correlations between repeated measures of
each index were examined to estimate the stability of
each measure. All indexes were standardized within
occasions to SD units for analyses using z-scores.
Cardiometabolic
traits
were
also
standardized
to
allow effect size comparability.
In the first set of models, we examined associations
of BMI and fat mass index measured at age 10 years
with cardiometabolic traits at age 18 years using
linear
regression
with
robust
standard
errors,
adjusting for demographics (age, sex, ethnicity, and
maternal education). We then examined mutually
adjusted
associations
of
each
regional
fat
index
(trunk, arm, and leg) at age 10 years in relation to
these cardiometabolic traits. Lean mass index at age
10 years was then examined in relation to traits as
described, with additional adjustment for fat mass
index.
Evidence
of
interaction
was
assessed
by
including product terms of fat and lean mass indexes
in linear models in relation to cardiometabolic traits
and
examining
the
direction
of
interaction
co-
efficients and their p values.
Second, we examined BMI and fat mass index
measured at age 18 years in relation to these same
cardiometabolic traits at age 18 years adjusting for
demographics plus smoking, alcohol, and puberty
timing. Differences in effect size for fat measures at
18 versus 10 years of age were assumed to reflect
differences in duration of exposure to fat levels if
correlations between repeated fat measures were
high. These were repeated using regional fat indexes
and lean mass index at age 18 years, as described.
Third, we examined changes in BMI and fat mass
index on the basis of differences in standardized
values from 10 to 18 years of age in relation to car-
diometabolic traits at age 18 years. These adjusted for
demographics plus initial BMI/fat mass index at age
10
years.
We
then
examined
mutually
adjusted
change in each regional fat index from 10 to 18 years
of age and change in lean mass index adjusted for
change
in
fat
mass
index
in
relation
to
car-
diometabolic traits, again with each adjusted for its
value at age 10 years.
SUPPLEMENTARY
ANALYSES. We
repeated
main
analyses (which had varying sample sizes) on a
complete-case sample of participants with data on all
variables (all fat measures on both occasions, cova-
riates, and all cardiometabolic traits).

 To examine potential nonlinear associations of in-
dex change, we examined tertiles of SD change of
each fat and lean measure from 10 to 18 years of age in
relation to summary cardiometabolic traits at age 18
years.
To compare the explanatory power of current
versus change values of total and regional fat indexes
for cardiometabolic traits, we compared the propor-
tion of variance in each trait explained by separate
(not mutually adjusted) linear regression models of
each fat index at age 18 years versus change in each
fat index from 10 to 18 years of age. Models were
adjusted for a common set of basic covariates (age at
cardiometabolic trait assessment, sex, ethnicity, and
maternal education).
Seventeen principal components explain 95% of
the
variance
in
these
highly
correlated
car-
diometabolic traits on the basis of previous ALSPAC
analyses (26); this can be used to correct nominal
significance thresholds for multiple testing using the
Bonferroni method (e.g., alpha ¼ 0.05/17). Here, we
focus on effect size and precision (27,28). Analyses
were conducted using Stata version 15.1 (StataCorp,
College Station, Texas).
RESULTS
SAMPLE CHARACTERISTICS. A total of 2,840 partic-
ipants were eligible for inclusion in $1 analysis at
each time point (Figure 1). Of these, 55.3% were female
and 3.7% of nonwhite ethnicities (Table 1). Mean BMI
was 17.5 � 2.7 kg/m2 at age 10 years (mean 9.8 years);
12.7% overall had obesity using BMI $ 20.1 kg/m2
among male subjects and BMI $ 21.0 kg/m2 among
female subjects on the basis of 95th percentile values
from a World Health Organization 2007 preadult
reference population (29). Mean BMI was 22.7 � 0.4 kg/
m2 at age 18 years (mean 17.7 years); 10.5% overall had
obesity using BMI $27.3 kg/m2 among male subjects
and BMI $27.6 kg/m2 among female subjects (29).
Excluded versus included participants had slightly
higher BMI and age at the age 18 years clinic visit, were
less likely to be female, and were more likely to have
low maternal education (Online Table 1).
CORRELATIONS
AMONG
BMI
AND
DXA
FAT
INDEXES. Correlations between repeated measures
at 10 and 18 years of age were approximately 0.7 for
BMI, fat mass index, and regional fat indexes. At age
10 years, BMI was correlated with total and regional
fat indexes at 0.9; this was 0.5 between BMI and lean
mass index. Correlations were similar at age 18 years
(e.g., 0.8 between BMI and fat mass index and 0.9
between BMI and trunk fat index). Change in BMI was
more strongly correlated with change in each fat in-
dex (e.g., 0.9 with change in fat mass index and
0.9 with change in trunk fat index) than with change
in lean mass index (0.4). All had p values <0.0001 and
are shown in Online Figures 1 to 4.

 LDL, and remnant particles; with lower cholesterol in
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles; and with
higher triglycerides across all particles except LDL.
Associations were strong with higher insulin, glucose,
glycoprotein acetyls, and CRP. Associations of fat
mass index with these traits closely resembled those
of BMI (Figure 2). For example, each SD higher fat
mass index was associated with 0.23 SD higher DBP
(95%
confidence
interval
[CI]:
0.20
to
0.27;
p < 0.0001) versus 0.22 SD higher DBP (95% CI: 0.18 to
0.25; p < 0.0001) for BMI, with these measures
explaining
7.1%
versus
6.7%
of
trait
variance,
respectively.
Association patterns of trunk fat index at age 10
years with cardiometabolic traits closely resembled
those of BMI and fat mass index (Figure 3). Effect
sizes were double for many traits (e.g., 0.32 SD of
total cholesterol in VLDL for trunk fat index vs. 0.14
SD for fat mass index). Effect sizes for arm fat index
were smaller but directionally concordant with trunk
fat index, while those for leg fat index were similarly
large but directionally discordant (e.g., �0.31 SD;

ASSOCIATIONS OF BMI AND DXA FAT INDEXES AT
AGE 18 YEARS WITH CARDIOMETABOLIC TRAITS AT
AGE 18 YEARS. BMI at age 18 years was more strongly
associated with cardiometabolic traits at age 18 years
than was BMI at age 10 years. For example, the co-
efficient rose from 0.13 to 0.33 SD for higher total
cholesterol in VLDL and from 0.18 to 0.31 SD for
glycoprotein acetyls. The pattern and magnitude of
associations for fat mass index again closely resem-
bled those of BMI (Figure 2), for example, 0.36 SD
(95% CI: 0.31 to 0.41; p < 0.0001) of glycoprotein

respectively.
Among regional fat indexes, only trunk fat index at
age 18 years showed larger effect sizes in relation to
cardiometabolic traits at age 18 years versus its index
at age 10 years (Figure 3). For example, the co-
efficients rose from 0.32 to 0.60 SD for total choles-
terol
in
VLDL
and
from
0.38
to
0.69
SD
for
triglycerides in VLDL. Evidence for heterogeneity
across regional fat measures was again strongest for
VLDL- and HDL-related traits (typically p < 0.0001)
and amino acids.
Effect sizes for lean mass index at age 18 years
were often double those at age 10 years and showed
attenuation upon adjustment for fat mass index (e.g.,
from 0.14 to 0.06 SD for total cholesterol in VLDL).
Evidence for interaction between fat and lean mass
indexes at age 18 years for most traits was strongest
for
VLDL-related
traits
(e.g.,
p
¼
0.0003
for
triglycerides in VLDL), but interaction coefficients
were positive, and evidence was weaker across wider
traits (p < 0.0001 to 0.99, median p ¼ 0.12).
Comparable associations were seen between BMI
and DXA fat indexes for lipoprotein subclasses, apo-
lipoproteins, and clinical trait precursors, including
fatty acid ratios and branched chain and aromatic
amino acids; these again tended to be higher in
magnitude versus the earlier assessment (full results
in Online Tables 2, 4, 5, and 9).

Gains in BMI from 10 to 18 years of age were more

SD (95% CI: 0.27 to 0.48; p < 0.0001) per SD unit
gain in BMI, with measures explaining 16.8% versus
15.7% of trait variance, respectively.
Among
regional
fat
measures,
associations
of
gains in trunk fat index most resembled associations
of gains in BMI and fat mass index (Figure 5). Effect
size for gains in trunk fat index was largest for in-
sulin at 0.51 SD (95% CI: �0.09 to 1.10; p ¼ 0.10),
albeit with lower precision from higher skewedness.
Associations for gains in leg fat index showed more
directional concordance with gains in trunk fat index
than gains in arm fat index for cholesterol and tri-
glycerides
across
particle
types.
Evidence
was
weaker for heterogeneity across regional fat mea-
sures but remained strongest for VLDL- and HDL-
related traits.
Effect sizes were also larger for change in lean mass
index versus its cross-sectional assessments but were
also substantially attenuated upon adjustment for
change in fat mass index. Evidence for interaction
between change in fat and lean mass indexes for traits
was generally weak across traits (p ¼ 0.002 to 0.99,
median
p
¼
0.22),
with
positive
interaction
coefficients.
Comparably strong associations were seen between
gains in BMI and gains in DXA fat indexes in relation
to lipoprotein subclasses, apolipoproteins, and clin-
ical trait precursors, including fatty acid ratios and
branched chain and aromatic amino acids (Online
Figures 5 and 6; full results in Online Tables 6 to 9).
SUPPLEMENTARY ANALYSES. Repetition of analyses
described previously in a complete-case sample of
1,722 participants gave similar association directions
and magnitudes (Online Tables 2 to 9).
Higher tertiles of gains in BMI and fat indexes were
comparably associated with summary cardiometabolic
traits (Online Table 10). Associations for SBP, DBP,
total cholesterol in HDL, triglycerides, and glycopro-
tein acetyls most reflected those of gains in trunk fat
index; those for glucose reflected those of gains in leg
fat index; those for total cholesterol in serum and LDL
and CRP reflected gains in arm fat index; and those for
insulin reflected gains in all fat indexes. Lean mass
index change tertiles were less associated with traits.

DISCUSSION
In this study we compared BMI, the most widely used
measure of body fatness, with more objective fat in-
dexes in their associations with cardiometabolic traits
relevant to CHD (Central Illustration). We examined
duration of exposure to and change in BMI and DXA
fat measures over 8 years in relation to detailed traits
from targeted metabolomics. Our results suggest that
higher fat mass index and BMI are similarly associ-
ated with higher blood pressure, higher VLDL and
LDL cholesterol, lower HDL cholesterol, higher tri-
glycerides, and higher glycemic and inflammatory
traits,
plus
clinical
trait
precursors
including
branched chain and aromatic amino acids. These
patterns closely resembled those seen for trunk fat

Gains in body mass index and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry–derived total and regional (trunk, arm, leg) fat indexes from 10 to 18 years of age were examined in
relation to cardiometabolic traits from clinical assessments and targeted metabolomics at age 18 years among 2,840 offspring from the ALSPAC (Avon Longitudinal
Study of Parents and Children) cohort. Models were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, maternal education, and index level at age 10 years. Trunk fat index gain was
additionally adjusted for change in arm and leg fat indexes. Associations were similar in direction and magnitude for the 3 indexes shown and were weaker for gains in
arm and leg fat indexes. HDL ¼ high-density lipoprotein; LDL ¼ low-density lipoprotein; VLDL ¼ very-low-density lipoprotein.

 index. Higher lean mass index was weakly associated
with traits and did not appear to protect against ef-
fects of higher fatness. Altogether, the results support
abdominal
fatness
as
a
primary
driver
of
car-
diometabolic dysfunction and BMI as a useful tool for
detecting its effects.
Duration of fat exposure was assessed using a
simple age comparison whereby fat measures were
taken at 10 and 18 years of age, and effect sizes were
compared
in
relation
to
cardiometabolic
traits
assessed at age 18 years, the latter fat measure
assumed to capture more time exposed to tissue
levels given sufficiently high correlations between
repeated fat measures over time (0.7 here). Effect
sizes increased with time for virtually all traits,
especially for total VLDL cholesterol and triglyceride
content. Trunk fat index was the regional measure
most resembling these patterns and was the only one
adversely influenced by longer exposure. Higher leg
fat, in contrast, appeared beneficial for traits at each
time point, particularly for cholesterol and triglycer-
ide profiles.
Patterns for BMI and fat mass index were rein-
forced through analyses of gains over 8 years with
strongly adverse associations with cardiometabolic
traits at age 18 years, again with comparable effect
sizes between measures. Among these were higher
LDL and remnant cholesterol and higher blood pres-
sure and glucose, which are likely causal for CHD (30)
and which together mediate much of the CHD risk
conferred by higher BMI (6). Gains in BMI and fat
mass index were also similarly associated with higher
inflammatory glycoprotein acetyls and fasting insu-
lin, which marks insulin resistance, drives type 2
diabetes (11), and amplifies CHD and mortality risk
(31). Once again, these associations closely resembled
those for gains in trunk fat index, suggesting that
effects are driven largely by abdominal fat gain. To a
lesser
extent,
gains
in
leg
fat
were
associated
adversely with cholesterol and triglyceride content,
suggesting
that
although
higher
leg
fat
appears
beneficial using one-off measures, fat gain is not
beneficial in any region.
The striking resemblance of BMI with total and
trunk
fat
indexes
in
associations
with
car-
diometabolic traits reflects the strong correlations
between measures in this study (all about 0.9). The
correlation between change in BMI was also highest
with change in trunk fat index (at 0.9 vs. 0.8 for arm
and leg fat indexes), indicating that although most fat
gain occurs in the trunk, BMI is highly capable of
detecting its effects, at least in young populations.
Although current levels of total and regional fat in-
dexes and their changes over time were both strongly
associated with cardiometabolic traits, current levels
showed greater explanatory power by way of more
variance
explained
in
several
important
traits,
including
blood
pressure,
cholesterol
and
tri-
glycerides in VLDL, insulin, and inflammatory glyco-
protein
acetyls.
Current
index
levels
and
their
changes had similar explanatory power for other
traits, including cholesterol and triglycerides in LDL
and HDL, and glucose. This suggests that knowing
one’s current level of fatness is at least as informative
as knowing one’s change in fatness over time for in-
termediates of CHD. This has welcome implications
given the relative ease of measuring current fatness
versus change in fatness in clinical settings.
Higher lean mass index was less associated with
cardiometabolic traits. Irrespective of change in fat
mass index, gains in lean mass index were associated
most strongly with higher SBP and creatinine, a
protein-like
marker
of
muscle
mass
and
kidney
function. Findings support those of a previous cross-
sectional study of adolescents suggesting paradoxi-
cally adverse associations of higher lean mass index
with lower HDL cholesterol, higher blood pressure,
and higher insulin (15). Attenuations were substantial
upon adjustment for fat mass index, however, indi-
cating confounding by accompanying fat gain. Effect
sizes were also smaller than for fat mass index. Lower
grip strength, an indirect measure of lower lean mass,
has been associated with higher cardiovascular- and
all-cause mortality risk among adults independent of
fat mass (32,33). One recent study using UK Biobank
data suggested independent associations of one-off
measures of higher fat mass and lower grip strength
with mortality (34), supporting both fat loss and
muscle gain as priorities for longevity. Our results
suggest that priorities are unlikely equal with respect
to type 2 diabetes and CHD risk, because causal in-
termediates track more closely alongside total fat
than lean mass, and higher leanness did not appear
protective against higher fatness. Evidence for inter-
action was generally weak, and importantly, effects
operated in the same direction; that is, higher lean-
ness appeared to amplify, not reduce, effects of
higher fatness. Such positive interactions are, in any
case, sensitive to measurement scaling and consid-
ered less informative than crossover interactions
(35,36). An important caveat of this study with regard
to lean mass is its focus on total “resting” mass and
not dynamic properties of lean tissue in response to
physical activity. This is important because key ben-
efits of skeletal muscle are transient, such as anti-
inflammatory myokine release through contractile
functions (12,13). Moderate correlations do exist be-
tween
muscle
mass,
quality,
and
strength
(37),

 however, and so higher resting lean mass may reflect
more regular contractile activity. Correlations be-
tween fat and lean mass indexes here were low to
moderately positive, possibly reflecting low overall
fatness in the study population (12.7% and 10.5% had
obesity at 10 and 18 years of age, respectively), and
downward pressure by fat on muscle volume beyond
the minimum needed for mobility. Higher fatness
also reduces habitual physical activity (38,39), which
may in turn reduce muscle mass.
Patterns of fat distribution are known to differ by
sex, with men tending to store fat more abdominally
and women more peripherally, resulting in higher
visceral-to-subcutaneous
fat
volumes
and
insulin
resistance in men (17). Higher fatness is therefore
expected to affect cardiometabolic traits such as in-
sulin and LDL cholesterol more strongly among men.
Importantly, sex differences are also expected to be
directionally concordant, referring to magnitude, not
existence, of associations.
STUDY STRENGTHS. Strengths of this study include
measures of fat and lean mass from DXA scans, which
correlate well with those based on more resonant
(and expensive) computed tomography (40). We had
the rare opportunity of comparing the magnitude of
associations of BMI and DXA-based indexes measured
in childhood versus young adulthood with traits from
targeted metabolomics, which allowed us to distin-
guish their associations with cholesterol and triglyc-
eride content and clinical trait precursors in greater
detail than previously possible. This also allowed us
to address questions of both duration of exposure to
and change in each tissue type. Participants were
young and generally lean, thus minimizing distortion
of associations by pre-existing chronic diseases and
behaviors such as smoking and alcohol use, which are
more common at older ages. This is important given
complex bidirectional relations between smoking and
adiposity, with smoking leading to decreased BMI (41)
and higher BMI leading to increased smoking (42).
Investigations
among
adult
populations
should
consider how this important confounder influences
fat mass. Post-pubertal analyses were adjusted for an
objective height-based measure of puberty timing
because earlier puberty onset is associated with
higher subsequent fatness and cardiometabolic traits
(43). This had little effect on results, possibly because
puberty timing effects are largely confounded by pre-
pubertal adiposity (44) and would thus overlap with
fat measures examined here as exposures.
STUDY
LIMITATIONS. Limitations
of
this
study
include the observational nature of the data, which
are
subject to residual confounding and reverse
causation
bias;
robust
genetic
proxies
for
more
objective fat and lean mass are not currently available
for Mendelian randomization analyses. Change scores
of fat indexes may be more prone to measurement
error than one-off measures; this could partly explain
inferior explanatory power of change versus current
values of fat indexes for some cardiometabolic traits.
Participants were also predominantly white and Eu-
ropean, limiting inference to other ethnic groups.
DXA measures do not distinguish histological sub-
types
of
fat
(e.g.,
visceral
from
subcutaneous).
Visceral fat is known to drive cardiometabolic effects
(10,11), but visceral fat volume does vary alongside
BMI in populations and so is likely captured by indi-
rect measures (45). We did not adjust for physical
activity because instrumental variable analyses sug-
gest that BMI influences activity more than activity
influences BMI (38,39), positioning physical activity
as a mediator, not a confounder, of associations.
Cardiorespiratory fitness would also be a mediator
because it is measured as a function of weight (e.g.,
maximum oxygen intake in milliliters per kilogram
per minute). “Fitness versus fatness” debates are
likely misguided.
CONCLUSIONS
Our results suggest that BMI and DXA fat mass index
are similarly associated with cardiometabolic traits
relevant to CHD. These include blood pressure, VLDL
and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and glycemic and
inflammatory traits, plus clinical trait precursors such
as branched
chain
amino
acids. Patterns closely
resemble those for trunk fat index, as reinforced
through analyses of duration of exposure to and
change
in
each
fat
measure
across
adolescence.
Higher leanness is less associated with these traits
and does not appear to protect against higher fatness.
Altogether, the results support abdominal fatness as a
primary driver of cardiometabolic dysfunction and
BMI as a useful tool for detecting its effects.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Although
BMI does not address fat distribution or distinguish fat
from lean mass, it can be used to detect subclinical car-
diometabolic abnormalities, which are closely related to
abdominal obesity. Higher lean mass is not likely to pro-
tect against the cardiometabolic consequences of obesity.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: It is reasonable to rely
on BMI as an indirect measure of total body and abdom-
inal fatness in future investigations of disease etiology
including large-scale Mendelian randomization studies.
