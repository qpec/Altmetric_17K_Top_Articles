SUMMARY
ZIKA virus (ZIKV) is an emerging pathogen respon-
sible for
neurological disorders and congenital
microcephaly. However, the molecular basis for
ZIKV
neurotropism
remains
poorly
understood.
Here, we show that Axl is expressed in human mi-
croglia and astrocytes in the developing brain and
that it mediates ZIKV infection of glial cells. Axl-medi-
ated ZIKV entry requires the Axl ligand Gas6, which
bridges ZIKV particles to glial cells. Following bind-
ing, ZIKV is internalized through clathrin-mediated
endocytosis and traffics to Rab5+ endosomes to
establish productive infection. During entry, the
ZIKV/Gas6 complex activates Axl kinase activity,
which downmodulates interferon signaling and facil-
itates infection. ZIKV infection of human glial cells is
inhibited by MYD1, an engineered Axl decoy recep-
tor, and by the Axl kinase inhibitor R428. Our results
highlight the dual role of Axl during ZIKV infection
of glial cells: promoting viral entry and modulating
innate immune responses. Therefore, inhibiting Axl
function may represent a potential target for future
antiviral therapies.
INTRODUCTION
ZIKA virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus originally isolated
from a sentinel monkey in the Zika Forest of Uganda (Dick et al.,
1952). Recent ZIKV outbreaks in French Polynesia and in Brazil,
which expanded rapidly throughout South and Central America,
have raised concerns about the pathogenicity of ZIKV. Infection
by ZIKV has been linked to several neurological disorders,
including Guillain-Barre
´ syndrome, meningoencephalitis, and
myelitis (White et al., 2016). Infection of pregnant women is asso-
ciated with fetal abnormalities, congenital microcephaly, and
abortion (Brasil et al., 2016; Mlakar et al., 2016), with evidence
of ZIKV detected in fetal brain tissues or amniotic fluid (Calvet
et al., 2016; Mlakar et al., 2016). Recent studies using murine
models of infection provided direct evidence for ZIKV vertical
transmission, leading to fetal abnormalities and brain develop-
ment defects in the offspring (Li et al., 2016a; Miner et al.,
2016a; Wu et al., 2016). In the developing fetal brain, ZIKV targets
neural progenitor cells, alters cell division, and induces cell death,
hampering brain development (Li et al., 2016a; Wu et al., 2016).
Identifying ZIKV entry factors represents a major challenge
in the understanding of ZIKV tropism and pathogenesis. We
recently showed that expression of several known flavivirus entry
factors, including Axl, confers sensitivity to ZIKV in otherwise
poorly susceptible cells (Hamel et al., 2015). Neutralizing anti-
bodies or small interfering RNA targeting Axl drastically reduced
ZIKV infection in primary dermal fibroblasts (Hamel et al., 2015),
supporting a crucial role for Axl in ZIKV biology. In agreement
with this model, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and immunochem-
istry studies confirmed that human neural progenitors cells,
which support productive ZIKV infection both in vitro and in vivo
(Li et al., 2016a; Tang et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016), express Axl
(Nowakowski et al., 2016). Axl mRNA is present in other brain
cells, including radial glial cells, astrocytes, and microglial cells
(Nowakowski et al., 2016). However, the effective contribution
of Axl in ZIKV infection of these cells remains to be determined.
Axl belongs to the Tyro3 Axl Mer (TAM) family, a group of tyro-
sine kinase receptors involved in the clearance of apoptotic cells
and regulation of innate immunity (Lemke and Rothlin, 2008;

 Rothlin et al., 2007). We have previously identified Axl as an entry
factor for dengue virus (DENV) (Meertens et al., 2012). DENV
binds indirectly to Axl through Gas6, the natural ligand of Axl,
which recognizes phosphatidylserine (PS) exposed at the surface
of the viral envelope and bridges the viral particle to the Axl recep-
tor. This mechanism of viral entry, based on PS exposure, has
been extended to other viruses and is termed viral apoptotic
mimicry (Amara and Mercer, 2015). In addition to its role in virus
entry, Axl also mediates signaling through its tyrosine kinase
domain to dampen type I interferon (IFN) signaling and facilitate
infection (Bhattacharyya et al., 2013; Meertens et al., 2012).
We report here that Axl is a crucial receptor for ZIKV infection
of human glial cells (astrocytes and microglia). We also describe
the dual role played by Axl, promoting viral entry and modulating
innate immune responses. We identify two inhibitors, the Axl
decoy receptor MYD1 and the Axl kinase inhibitor R428, that
efficiently inhibit ZIKV infection. Altogether, our study provides
important insights into the molecular interactions occurring
upon ZIKV entry into human glial cells.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Axl Is Expressed in Glial Cells in the Developing Brain
and mediates ZIKV infection
Single-cell mRNA sequencing studies have shown that the ‘‘ZIKV
entry receptor Axl is enriched in radial glia, microglia, and astro-
cytes’’ in the developing human cortex (Nowakowski et al.,
2016). Here we assessed whether the Axl protein could be de-
tected in microglia and astrocytes during human cortical develop-
ment. At 20 gestational weeks (GWs), Axl was strongly and widely
expressed in microglia (Iba1+ cells) that mainly localized in the
ventricular zone (VZ) and subventricular zone (SVZ) (Figure 1A).
Closer examination revealed that Axl labeling could be observed
in GFAP+ cells, such as radial glial progenitor cells along the
ventricle border and in a few differentiating subplate astrocytes
(Figure 1A). At a more advanced stage of development (26
GWs), microglial cells became denser in the VZ/SVZ, remaining
stronglyimmunoreactivetoAxlantibodies(Abs)(Figure1A).Inpar-
allel, Axl was occasionally observed in residual GFAP+ radial glial
cells of the VZ and also remained detectable in maturing astro-
cytes (Figure 1A). Based on this expression pattern, we postulated
that astrocytes and microglial cells might be major ZIKV targets.
Therefore, we investigated the susceptibility of the CHME3 micro-
glial cell line, primary human and murine astrocytes, and human
neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) to ZIKV infection. In agreement
with the expression profile of Axl in the human fetal brain and
data from the literature (Ji et al., 2013; Nowakowski et al., 2016),
all of these cells expressed high levels of Axl (Figure 1B), but not
on murine microglial cells, as described previously (Fourgeaud
et al., 2016; Ji et al., 2013; Figure 1B; Figure S1A). We challenged
these cells with the African ZIKV strain HD78788 (ZIKVHD78) at
MOIs of 1 and 10. The percentage of infected cells was quantified
24 hr later by flow cytometry using the pan-flavivirus anti-E protein
Ab 4G2. CHME3 cells, human and murine astrocytes, and hNPCs
were productively infected by ZIKV (Figure 1B; Figure S1B),
whereas murine microglial cells were resistant to ZIKV and other
flaviviruses (Figure S1A). ZIKV infection of human and murine pri-
mary astrocytes and CHME3 cells was abrogated by an anti-Axl
polyclonal Ab (pAb) but not a control pAb (Figure 1C), or by
silencing Axl expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) (Fig-
ure S1C). In contrast, the anti-Axl Ab did not significantly affect
ZIKV infection of hNPCs (Figure 1C, right), suggesting the exis-
tence of additional ZIKV entry receptors in these cells. We then
asked whether the related flavivirus DENV, which also exploits
Axl as an entry molecule (Meertens et al., 2012), has the same
tropism as ZIKV in neuronal cells. DENV productively infected
CHME3, murine astrocytes and hNPCs in an Axl-dependent
manner (Figures S1D and S1E), which is consistent with neurolog-
ical complications and neuroinvasion reported in numerous cases
of DENV (Carod-Artal et al., 2013). Our data reveal common entry
pathways for ZIKV and DENV in brain cells, although additional
mechanisms such as the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier
(BBB), access to brain cells, and/or virus-associated inflammation
may explain the variety and extent of neuropathological manifes-
tations observed with different flaviviruses.
The Axl Decoy Receptor MYD1 Sequesters Gas6 and
Inhibits ZIKV Infection
To investigate whether Axl-mediated ZIKV infection is depen-
dent on the TAM ligands Gas6 and Protein S (ProS) (Lemke
and Rothlin, 2008), CHME3 cells were infected with ZIKVHD78
in the absence of fetal calf serum (FCS), which naturally contains
TAM ligands (Ferna
´ ndez-Ferna
´ ndez et al., 2008). ZIKV infection
of CHME3 was dramatically reduced under serum-free condi-
tions (Figure 2A). Addition of Gas6 restored ZIKV infection at a
level comparable with control cells. Thus, Axl-mediated ZIKV-
infection is dependent on Gas6. Our results support a tripartite
model in which Gas6 binds to PS at the surface of ZIKV and
bridges virions to the Axl receptor. MYD1 is an engineered Axl
decoy receptor that displays a high affinity for human Gas6
and blocks the ligand-receptor interaction through complete
neutralization of Gas6 (Kariolis et al., 2014). MYD1 inhibited
ZIKV in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2B) but displayed
negligible effects on herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), a
neurotropic virus that infects cells independently of Axl (Meert-
ens et al., 2012). In addition, MYD1 inhibited ZIKV binding to
CHME3 cells (Figure 2C). We observed similar results in HeLa
cells stably expressing Axl (HeLa-Axl) (Figures S1A and S1B).
Infection of primary astrocytes (Figure 2D) or CHME3 cells (Fig-
ure S1C) was also inhibited by MYD1 in the presence of FCS.
Because MYD1 has negligible binding to ProS (Kariolis et al.,
2014), these results suggest that Gas6 is the primary driver
for ZIKV infection in glial cells. To test this hypothesis, we incu-
bated primary astrocytes and CHME3 with an anti-Gas6 pAb
before challenge with ZIKV. The anti-Gas6 pAb, but not the con-
trol immunoglobulin (Ig), inhibited ZIKV infection (Figure 2E;
(C) CHME3, human and murine primary astrocytes, and hNPCs were pre-incubated for 30 min with neutralizing goat anti-Axl or goat IgG prior to infection with
ZIKV (MOI 10).
(B and C) Infection was assessed 24 or 48 hpi (murine astrocytes) by flow cytometry. Data shown are means ± SD of three independent experiments. Significance
was calculated using a two-sample Student’s t test (n.s., not significant; **p < 0.001; ***p < 0.0001).

 Figure S1D). Altogether, our results suggest that the decoy Axl
receptor MYD1 blocks ZIKV infection by sequestering Gas6
and preventing virus binding to Axl.
ZIKV Enters Axl-Expressing Cells by Clathrin-Mediated
Endocytosis and Traffics through Early Endosomes
To further investigate the mechanisms of ZIKV entry, we used
the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats
(CRISPR)-CRISPR associated protein 9 (Cas9) technology to
stably knock down Axl expression in CHME3 cells (AxlKO) (Fig-
ure 3A). AxlKO and parental CHME3 cells were then challenged
with ZIKVHD78 or the ZIKV strain H/PF/2013, a clinical strain iso-
lated from a patient in French Polynesia and closely related to
the epidemic strains from South and Central America (Calvet
et al., 2016). Infection with both the ZIKVHD78 and ZIKV H/PF/
2013 strains was abrogated in AxlKO cells (Figure 3B), whereas

 HSV-1 infection was not affected (Figure S3A). ZIKV infection
was restored in CHME3 AxlKO cells transduced with an Axl
wild-type (WT) cDNA, confirming the importance of Axl in ZIKV
infection (Figure S3B). To investigate whether Axl mediates
ZIKV endocytosis, we challenged parental and AxlKO CHME3
cells with ZIKVHD78 for 4 hr at 37�C and then treated the cells
with trypsin to remove non-internalized viral particles. We next
quantified ZIKV RNA levels by real-time qPCR. The amount of
internalized viral RNA was significantly reduced in AxlKO cells
(Figure 3C). We also performed a fluorescence in situ hybridiza-
tion (FISH)-based imaging assay (Savidis et al., 2016) to detect
viral RNA (vRNA) entry into the cytosol. As shown in Figure 3D,
a massive reduction of vRNA was observed 90 min post-infec-
tion in AxlKO cells compared with parental cells. Together, these
data show that Axl is an essential ZIKV cellular factor that pro-
motes virus entry.
Axl is known to mediate phagocytosis of apoptotic cells
(Lemke and Rothlin, 2008), yet flavivirus entry occurs mainly
through
clathrin-dependent
endocytosis
(Fernandez-Garcia
et al., 2016; van der Schaar et al., 2008). To characterize the en-
docytic route used by ZIKV to enter Axl-expressing cells,
CHME3 cells were treated with siRNAs directed against the cla-
thrin heavy chain (CLTC), an important component of the clathrin
triskelion required for clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV) formation
(McMahon and Boucrot, 2011). We also silenced Dynamin-2
(DNM2), a GTPase involved in pinching off endocytic vesicles
from the plasma membrane (Ferguson and De Camilli, 2012).
Forty-eight hours post-transfection, CLTC and DNM2 depletion
was assessed by immunoblotting (Figure S3C). Surface expres-
sion of Axl was not modified after silencing of clathrin heavy
chain (CTLTC) or DNM2 (Figure S3D), but ZIKV infection was
strongly impaired in these cells (Figures 3E and 3F). We obtained
similar results in HeLa-Axl cells (Figure S3E).
To investigate whether ZIKV fuses within the early or late endo-
somes, we transduced CHME3 cells with retroviral vectors ex-
pressing either the GFP-tagged WT or dominant-negative (DN)
forms of Rab5 (which block CCV transport and fusion to early en-
dosomes) or Rab7 (which inhibits cargo delivery to late endo-
somes) (Fernandez-Garcia et al., 2016). Expression of Rab5DN
reduced ZIKV infection by 85% compared with cells transduced
with the empty vector (Figure 3G; Figure S3F). Of note, Rab7DN
did not inhibit ZIKV infection, whereas Rab7 WT inhibited infec-
tion by 50%. Altogether, these results suggest that ZIKV particles
are internalized by clathrin and dynamin-dependent endocytosis
and delivered to early endosomes, where the mild acidic milieu is
optimal to trigger the conformational change of the envelope.
ZIKV Activates Axl Kinase Activity to Antagonize Type I
Interferon Signaling
To determine whether Axl kinase activity enhances ZIKV infec-
tion, we engineered CHME AxlKO cells stably expressing either
WT or a kinase-dead Axl mutant (KM, the K565M mutation lies
within the ATP binding site required for kinase activity). These
cells expressed similar surface levels of Axl (Figure S4A), and
the mutated receptor was catalytically inactive (Figure S4B).
Both cells similarly bound ZIKV (data not shown) and mediated
vRNA entry into the cytosol with similar efficiency (Figure 4A).
ZIKV infection was restored in cells expressing Axl WT (Fig-
ure 4B; Figure S4C) and reduced in cells complemented with
Axl KM (Figure 4B; Figure S4C). These data indicate that the ki-
nase activity of Axl is important for ZIKV infection and suggest
that Axl ligation by ZIKV may initiate signal transduction events
that facilitate a post-entry step in the viral life cycle. To directly
assess this hypothesis, we analyzed the Axl phosphorylation sta-
tus in CHME3 cells challenged with ZIKVHD78 in the absence or
presence of purified Gas6. As shown in Figure 4C, addition of
Gas6 alone led to a dose-dependent activation of Axl, whereas
ZIKV bound to Gas6 potentiated Axl phosphorylation (Figure 4C).
Consistent with this, we found that R428, a small-molecule inhib-
itor of Axl kinase activity (Holland et al., 2010; Figure 4D), in-
hibited ZIKV infection of glial cells in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 4E; Figure S4E) but had no effect on HSV-1 (Figure S4D).
Of note, R428 treatment did not block ZIKV entry (Figure 4F; Fig-
ure S4F) or affect Axl surface levels (Figure 4F) but significantly
reduced viral RNA amplification at a later time point (Figure 4F).
Nonetheless, despite statistically robust analysis indicating that
differences in vRNA level expression at 4 hours post infection
(hpi) were non-significant, we could not rule out that the Axl ki-
nase domain might be partially involved in Axl-mediated ZIKV
internalization.
Signaling through Axl dampens the innate immune responses
(Rothlin et al., 2007). A recent publication showed that Gas6-
coated viruses activate Axl, dampen type I IFN signaling, and
promote infection of murine dendritic cells (Bhattacharyya
et al., 2013). To evaluate whether Axl kinase activity modulates
IFN response to ZIKV, we quantified the levels of IFN-b and
SOCS-1 mRNA by qPCR in CHME cells treated with the Axl
antagonist R428 and infected by ZIKV. 24 hpi, R428 led to a 4-
and 16-fold increase in IFN-b and SOCS1 mRNA levels, respec-
tively (Figure 4G) but also IFNl1, IFNl2, and ISG20 (Figure S4G)
as well as the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor
a (TNF-a), interleukin-6 (IL-6), or IL-1b (Figure S4H). Of note,
IFNb, SOCS1, and pro-inflammatory cytokine RNA levels were
significantly higher in infected CHME AxlKO cells expressing
Axl KM compared with Axl WT (Figure 4H; Figure S4I). Overall,
these data strongly suggest that ZIKV-mediated activation of
Axl may enhance viral replication by mediating a global suppres-
sion of innate immunity in glial cells.
In conclusion, we describe a major role of the TAM receptor
Axl and its ligand Gas6 in ZIKV infection of glial cells: astrocytes
and microglia. Our results complement two recent studies in
mouse models (Li et al., 2016b) and in human fetus brain tissue
(E and F) CHME3 cells were transfected with a siRNA pool targeting clathrin heavy chain (siCLTC), Dynamin2 (siDNM2), or a non-targeting siRNA (siNT) as a
negative control, and cells were infected with ZIKV.
(G) CHME3 cells were transduced with a retroviral vector expressing the WT or DN forms of EGFP-Rab5 and -Rab7. Cells were challenged 24 hr post-trans-
duction with ZIKV (MOI 5). For each sample, the percentage of infected cells was quantified in the EGFP-positive population. Infection was assessed 24 hpi
by flow cytometry. The data shown are means ± SD of two independent experiments. Significance was calculated using a two-sample Student’s t test (D–F) or
one-way ANOVA statistical test (C and G). **p < 0.001, ***p < 0.0001.

 organotypic cultures (Retallack et al., 2016), showing that astro-
cytes and microglia support ZIKV infection. We highlight a dual
function of Axl/Gas6 during ZIKV infection in brain cells: Axl indi-
rectly binds ZIKV through Gas6 bridging and mediates ZIKV
endocytosis through the CME pathway, and Axl is a signaling
molecule that is activated by ZIKV-Gas6 complexes during viral
entry to dampen innate immunity.
Our data are consistent with the detection of ZIKV antigen in
glial cells from brain autopsies of fetuses diagnosed with micro-
cephaly (Martines et al., 2016) and suggest that astrocytes and
microglial cell are important ZIKV target cells. Many astrocytes
are located in the vicinity of capillaries and could represent
one of the first target cells encountered by ZIKV after crossing
the blood-brain barrier. Furthermore, astrocytes contributes to
BBB maintenance; therefore, their infection by ZIKV may induce
BBB leakage, as recently reported in mice (Shao et al., 2016). In
addition to being productively infected and potentially serving as
a viral reservoir in the CNS, astrocytes and microglial cells could
contribute to ZIKV-induced neuro-inflammation by releasing
pro-inflammatory cytokines (Osso and Chan, 2015) that might
be detrimental to neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation
(Ji et al., 2015). This is consistent with a recent study in a mouse
model reporting increased expression of cytokines in the devel-
oping brain correlating with ZIKV pathogenesis (Li et al., 2016a).
In mice and monkeys, microglia have been shown to be acti-
vated a few days after ZIKV infection (Huang et al., 2016; Shao
et al., 2016). Because microglia activation by LPS reduces pre-
cursor cell numbers (Cunningham et al., 2013), it will be worth
evaluating how ZIKV infection may contribute to microglia acti-
vation and subsequent pathogenesis.
We further report that blocking Axl does not prevent ZIKV
infection of hNPCs, suggesting that the virus may use different
receptors or pathways depending on the cell type. These data
may explain prior findings that Axl-KO mice deficient in type-I
IFN signaling remain susceptible to ZIKV (Miner et al., 2016b),
probably because of decreased blood-brain barrier integrity or
dampened host response (Miner et al., 2015; Schmid et al.,
2016). Because our data and previous studies (Bhattacharyya
et al., 2013; Rothlin et al., 2007) reveal that one major function
of Axl is to modulate innate immunity, it will be of interest to
reconsider the implication of Axl during ZIKV infection of type I
IFN-competent animals. Interestingly, we show that Axl medi-
ates infection of murine astrocytes, opening the way to explore
the role of astrocytes using mouse models of in utero infection
(Li et al., 2016a; Wu et al., 2016).
Finally, we identified two antagonists of the Axl/Gas6 pathway
(MYD1 and R428) displaying antiviral activity. MYD1 blocks ZIKV
binding to Axl by trapping Gas6 and abrogating Axl signaling,
whereas the kinase inhibitor R428 blocks Axl phosphorylation
and enhances innate immune signaling upon infection. Our
results suggest that inhibition of Axl function might protect mi-
croglia and astrocytes from infection and may reduce the viral
load in the CNS. On a cautious note, interfering with Axl kinase
activity could have an adverse effect on neurogenesis by
increasing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which
may reduce neuronal stem cell proliferation and differentiation
(Ji et al., 2013). Furthermore, as reported in mice (Miner et al.,
2015; Schmid et al., 2016), global knockdown of Axl may poten-
tiate infection of other Axl-independent cell types (e.g., radial
glial cells) by down-modulating immune control of viral spread
or facilitating BBB crossing. In this context, it will be of interest
to determine, in murine or primate models (Adams Waldorf
et al., 2016; Osuna et al., 2016), whether short-term pharmaco-
logical inhibition of the Axl/Gas6 pathway, combined with
recently identified small-molecule inhibitors of ZIKV infection or
induced neural cell death (Xu et al., 2016), could be used for
treatment or prophylaxis of ZIKV infection.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Human Tissue Procurement and Processing, Primary Cells, and
Human Neural Progenitor Cells
Human fetuses aged 20 and 26 GWs or post-ovulatory week without any
neuropathological alterations were collected within 24 hr after legal abortion
or spontaneous death. All procedures were approved by the ethics committee
(Agence de Biome
´ dicine, approval number PFS12-0011). Tissues were immer-
sion-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hr, cryoprotected in 20% sucrose,
and stored at �80�C until use. Tissues were cut into 12-mm-thick coronal
sections, mounted on Superfrost slides, and stored at �80�C. Human primary
astrocytes were purchased from Lonza and cultured according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions. hNPCs used in this study were prepared as described
previously (Brnic et al., 2012).
Ethics Statement
Human fetuses were obtained after legal abortion with written informed con-
sent of the patient. The procedure for the procurement and use of human fetal
CNS tissue was approved and monitored by the Comite
´ Consultatif de Protec-
tion des Personnes dans la Recherche Biome
´ dicale of Henri Mondor Hospital.
Virus Preparation and Titration
The ZIKV HD78788 strain (obtained via Phillipe Despres, Institut Pasteur) was
isolated from a human case in Senegal (1991) (Faye et al., 2014). The ZIKV PF-
25013-18 strains (obtained via V. M. Cao-Lormeau Institut Louis Malarde
´ ) was
(C) Serum-starved CHME3 cells were incubated for 10 min with increasing concentrations of rGas6 alone or along with ZIKV (MOI 50). Phosphorylation of
immunoprecipitated Axl was monitored with a phosphotyrosine-specific antibody (immunoblot: anti-phosphotyrosine [IB: pY]).
(D) CHME3 cells were preincubated for 30 min with or without R428 prior to Gas6 stimulation.
(E) CHME3 cells were preincubated for 30 min with the indicated concentration of R428 or DMSO (mock) and challenged with ZIKV (MOI 2).
(F and G) CHME3 cells were preincubated for 30 min with R428 (1 mM) or DMSO (mock), and cells were challenged with ZIKV (MOI 30) in the continuous presence
of the drug. 4 hpi, the virus was washed out. The inset displays cell surface expression of Axl at the time of infection. Total cellular RNA was extracted 4 and 24 hpi,
and relative viral RNA levels and IFNb or SOCS1 mRNA levels were determined by real-time quantitative PCR.
(H) CHME AxlKO cells complemented with Axl WT or Axl KM were challenged with ZIKV (MOI 20). Total cellular RNA was extracted 18 hpi, and IFNb and SOCS1
mRNA levels were determined by real-time quantitative PCR. Infection was assessed 24 hpi by flow cytometry.
(B and E–H) The data shown are means ± SD and are representative of three independent experiments performed in duplicate.
(A, C, and D) The data shown are representative images of two independent experiments. Significance was calculated using a one-way ANOVA statistical test
with a Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test (E) or a two-sample Student’s t test (A, B, and F–H). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.001, ***p < 0.0001.

 isolated from a viremic patient in French Polynesia in 2013 (Cao-Lormeau
et al., 2014). Viruses were prepared and titered as described previously
(Meertens et al., 2012).
Axl Ablation by CRISPR-Cas9 and Axl Complementation
CHME3 cells were transfected with the lentiCRISPRV2 plasmid encoding
the codon-optimized Cas9 nuclease (Addgene) and Axl-specific guide RNA
(GGGGACTCACGGGCACCCTTCGG). Transfected cells were selected by pu-
romycin treatment (1 mg/ml) and sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) for loss of Axl expression after staining with anti-Axl Ab.
Statistical Analyses
Graphical representation and statistical analyses were performed using
Prism5 software (GraphPad). Unless otherwise stated, results are shown as
means ± SD from three independent experiments. Differences were tested
for statistical significance using unpaired two-tailed t test or one-way
ANOVA with Tukey post test.
