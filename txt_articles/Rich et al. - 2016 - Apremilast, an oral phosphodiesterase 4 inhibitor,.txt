Background: In the phase III double-blind Efficacy and Safety Trial Evaluating the Effects of Apremilast in
Psoriasis (ESTEEM) 1 and 2, apremilast, an oral phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, demonstrated efficacy in
moderate to severe psoriasis.
Objective: We sought to evaluate efficacy of apremilast in nail/scalp psoriasis in ESTEEM 1 and 2.
Methods: A total of 1255 patients were randomized (2:1) to apremilast 30 mg twice daily or placebo. At
week 16, placebo patients switched to apremilast through week 32, followed by a randomized withdrawal
phase to week 52. A priori efficacy analyses included patients with nail (target nail Nail Psoriasis Severity
Index score $1) and moderate to very severe scalp (Scalp Physician Global Assessment score $3) psoriasis
at baseline.
Results: At baseline, 66.1% and 64.7% of patients had nail psoriasis; 66.7% and 65.5% had moderate to very
severe scalp psoriasis in ESTEEM 1 and 2. At week 16, apremilast produced greater improvements in Nail
Psoriasis Severity Index score versus placebo; mean percent change: �22.5% versus 16.5% (ESTEEM 1;
P \ .0001) and �29.0% versus �7.1% (ESTEEM 2; P = .0052). At week 16, apremilast produced greater
NAPSI-50 response (50% reduction from baseline in target nail Nail Psoriasis Severity Index score) versus
placebo (both studies P \ .0001) and ScPGA response (Scalp Physician Global Assessment score 0 or 1)
versus placebo (both studies P \ .0001). Improvements were generally maintained over 52 weeks in
patients with Psoriasis Area and Severity Index response at week 32.

Key words: apremilast; nail psoriasis; phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor; psoriasis; scalp psoriasis; systemic
therapy.
Psoriasis is a chronic, sys-
temic inflammatory disease
with a prevalence as high as
3.1% in the United States.1 In
patients with psoriasis, dys-
regulation of the immune
response is thought to result
in a chronic imbalance in the
production of proinflamma-
tory and anti-inflammatory
cytokines.2-4 Available thera-
pies suppress inflammatory
responses or target specific
mediators implicated in the
pathogenesis
of
psoriasis.
However, long-term use of these therapies is often
compromised
by variable
efficacy, safety,
and
tolerability issues, or need for administration via
injection or infusion.5,6
Dermatologic signs and symptoms of psoriasis
often occur in difficult-to-treat areas such as the nails
and scalp. Nail involvement occurs in approximately
50% of patients with plaque psoriasis, with a lifetime
incidence of 80% to 90%7-9; scalp involvement affects
up to 80% of patients with psoriasis.10,11 Involvement
of these difficult-to-treat areas may have particularly
detrimental effects on patient quality of life.7,10-12
Treatment of nail and scalp psoriasis with topical
therapy is often challenging because of the poor
diffusion into the nail tissue and the inaccessibility of
scalp lesions.8,11 Patient satisfaction and compliance
with current treatment modalities for nail and scalp
psoriasis are often low because of difficulties in
administration to the scalp, poor compliance, and
inadequate long-term efficacy.13-15
Cyclic adenosine monophosphate is a key modu-
lator of immune cell responses, and its levels are
regulated by phosphodiesterase 4.16 Apremilast, an
oral phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, increases intra-
cellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels,
thus regulating production of proinflammatory and
anti-inflammatory
mediators.17
Apremilast
was
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
in 2014 and by the European Commission in 2015 for
the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic
arthritis and for patients with moderate to severe
plaque psoriasis.18,19
The approval of apremi-
last for psoriasis was based
on
the
findings
of
the
Efficacy
and
Safety
Trial
Evaluating
the
Effects
of
Apremilast
in
Psoriasis
(ESTEEM) phase III clinical

comprising
2 multicenter, randomized,
placebo-controlled
studies
that evaluated the efficacy,
safety,
and
tolerability
of
apremilast
in
adults
with
moderate to severe plaque
psoriasis.
The
efficacy
of
apremilast in patients with nail and scalp psoriasis
over 16 weeks of treatment has been reported.20,21
This report describes the efficacy of apremilast in the
subsets of patients from the phase III ESTEEM trials
with nail psoriasis and moderate to very severe scalp
psoriasis with up to 52 weeks of treatment.
METHODS
Study design and participants
ESTEEM 1 and 2 were similarly designed phase III,
multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies of apremilast 30 mg twice daily
(BID) in patients with moderate to severe plaque
psoriasis (Fig 1). Full details of the study design,
inclusion and exclusion criteria, patient population,
and primary safety and efficacy results for ESTEEM 1
and 2 have been described previously.20,21
Nail and scalp assessments
Nail and scalp assessments were made in all
patients at baseline using the Nail Psoriasis Severity
Index
(NAPSI)
and
Scalp
Physician
Global
Assessment (ScPGA). NAPSI is a composite score of
physician assessment of nail psoriasis22; a target nail
was used to assess nail involvement, if nail involve-
ment (NAPSI score $1) was present at baseline.
Target nail NAPSI scores range from 0 to 8; higher
scores indicate greater severity, and a decrease in
NAPSI score indicates improvement. The target
thumbnail or fingernail that represented the worst
nail psoriasis at baseline was assessed. Nail assess-
ments included the percent change from baseline in

 NAPSI score in the target nail and the proportion of
patients who achieved at least a 50% reduction from
baseline in target nail NAPSI score (NAPSI-50), and
the change from baseline in the number of involved
nails
in
patients
with
nail
psoriasis.
NAPSI
information was collected at baseline and weeks
16, 24, 32, 40, and 52. The ScPGA was used to assess
scalp involvement, in patients with a score of 3 or
greater at baseline. The ScPGA scale ranges from
0 (clear) to 5 (very severe). ScPGA scores were
collected at baseline and weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16,
then every 8 weeks up to weeks 40 and 52.
Patients
provided
written
informed
consent
before study-related procedures were performed,
and the protocol and consent were approved by
institutional review boards or ethics committees at all
investigational sites. The studies were conducted in
accordance with the principles of Good Clinical
Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki.
Statistical analysis
Efficacy was assessed using the full analysis set in
patients who had nail psoriasis (NAPSI score $1) at
baseline and moderate to very severe scalp psoriasis
(ScPGA score $3) at baseline. Discrete variables
(NAPSI-50, ScPGA score 0 or 1) were analyzed using
a x2 test. For continuous variables (eg, percent
change from baseline in NAPSI score), the analysis
of covariance model with treatment as a factor and
baseline value as a covariate was used. All statistical
significance was compared using the 2-sided 0.05
alpha level. Missing data were handled with the last
observation
carried
forward
methodology.
In
addition,
improvements
in
nail
bed
and
nail
matrix using the full analysis set were summarized
descriptively.
RESULTS
Patients
The full analysis set included 844 patients from
ESTEEM 1 (placebo: n = 282; apremilast 30 mg BID:
n = 562) and 411 patients from ESTEEM 2 (placebo:
n = 137; apremilast 30 mg BID: n = 274). At baseline,
558
(66.1%)
patients
in
ESTEEM
1
and
266
(64.7%) patients in ESTEEM 2 had nail psoriasis
(target nail NAPSI score $1), and 563 (66.7%)
patients
and
269
(65.5%)
patients
from
these
respective studies had moderate to very severe scalp
psoriasis (ScPGA score $3). Demographic and
baseline characteristics were appropriately balanced
between the placebo and apremilast 30 mg BID
groups among patients with nail or scalp psoriasis
(Tables I and II).
Results for period A (placebo-controlled
phase; weeks 0-16)
In both ESTEEM 1 and ESTEEM 2, NAPSI
improvements (ie, decreases) at week 16 were
significantly
greater
in
patients
treated
with
apremilast 30 mg BID versus placebo; the mean
percent
change
in
NAPSI
score
was
�22.5%
(ESTEEM 1; P \ .0001) and �29.0% (ESTEEM 2;
P = .0052) with apremilast versus 16.5% (ESTEEM 1)
and �7.1% (ESTEEM 2) with placebo (Fig 2, A and
B). As shown in Fig 2, C, a greater improvement from
baseline in target nail NAPSI score was associated
with increasing Psoriasis Area and Severity Index
(PASI) response across different PASI response
categories (PASI score categories: \50, 50 to \75,
75 to \90, $90). At week 16, a significantly greater
proportion of patients in the apremilast 30 mg BID
group also achieved a NAPSI-50 response compared
with the placebo group in each study (33.3% vs
14.9%, ESTEEM 1; 44.6% vs 18.7%, ESTEEM 2;
P \ .0001 both studies). A decrease from baseline
in the mean number of involved nails (mean baseline
value: 6-7 nails) occurred in the apremilast 30 mg
BID group at week 16 (mean change in number of
nails involved, ESTEEM 1: 0.7; ESTEEM 2: 1.3). In
comparison, the number of involved nails in the
placebo group was essentially unchanged from
baseline to week 16 in both studies (mean change,
ESTEEM 1: 0.1; ESTEEM 2: 0.4). Nail bed and nail
matrix scores also improved with apremilast 30 mg
BID versus placebo at week 16 in both ESTEEM 1 and
ESTEEM 2 (Table III).
Among patients with moderate to very severe
scalp psoriasis (ScPGA score $3) at baseline,
achievement of ScPGA score of 0 (clear) or 1
(minimal) at week 16 was significantly greater
in patients taking apremilast 30 mg BID versus
placebo (46.5% vs 17.5% ESTEEM 1; 40.9% vs 17.2%
ESTEEM 2; P \.0001 for both) (Fig 3). The effect of
apremilast 30 mg BID on scalp psoriasis in a patient
with a baseline ScPGA score of 5 (very severe) who
achieved ScPGA score of 0 (clear) after 16 weeks of
treatment is shown in Fig 4.

 Results for period B (weeks 16-32)
Among patients with nail psoriasis at baseline,
those who were randomized to apremilast 30 mg
BID at baseline continued to show improvement
in NAPSI score at week 32 (ESTEEM 1: �43.6%;
ESTEEM 2: �60.0%) (Fig 2, A and B). Patients initially
randomized to placebo who were switched to
apremilast 30 mg BID at week 16 showed improve-
ments during period B, similar to those seen in
apremilast patients during period A (Fig 2, A and B).

(ESTEEM) 1 and ESTEEM 2 *Doses of apremilast were titrated during the first week of
administration and at week 16, when placebo patients were switched to apremilast. Dosing was
maintained from weeks 16 to 32 (maintenance phase, period B). xTreatment from weeks 32 to
52 (randomized treatment withdrawal phase, period C) was based on the initial treatment
assignment and the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) response at week 32 (PASI-75 for
ESTEEM 1 and PASI-50 for ESTEEM 2). zPatients initially randomized to apremilast who
achieved PASI-75 (ESTEEM 1) or PASI-50 (ESTEEM 2) response at week 32 and were
rerandomized to placebo were switched back to apremilast at time of loss of effect, defined
as loss of PASI-75 (ESTEEM 1) or loss of 50% of the PASI improvement obtained at week 32
(ESTEEM 2), but no later than week 52. jjPatients who did not achieve a PASI-75 (ESTEEM 1) or
PASI-50 (ESTEEM 2) response at week 32 were able to add topicals and/or ultraviolet (UV) B
therapy at week 32 at the discretion of the investigator. Blinding was maintained until all
patients discontinued or completed their week 52 visit. BID, Twice daily.

 At week 32, the mean percent change from baseline
in NAPSI score for these patients was �24.6% and
�47.6% in ESTEEM 1 and ESTEEM 2, respectively.
The proportion of patients achieving NAPSI-50
response also increased during period B in patients
who continued on apremilast 30 mg BID (ESTEEM 1:
45.2%; ESTEEM 2: 55.4%) and in those who switched
from placebo to apremilast 30 mg BID (ESTEEM 1:
34.9%; ESTEEM 2: 52.0%). The number of involved
nails and nail bed/matrix scores decreased further
from weeks 16 to 32 in patients who continued on
apremilast 30 mg BID, and started to decrease among
placebo patients after the switch to apremilast 30 mg
BID (Table III).
Improvement in scalp involvement was generally
sustained through week 32 among patients initially
randomized to apremilast 30 mg BID at baseline; 140
(37.4%) and 57 (32.4%) patients in ESTEEM 1 and
ESTEEM 2, respectively, achieved ScPGA score of
0 or 1 at week 32. Among patients initially random-
ized to placebo who switched to apremilast at week
16, 71 (43.6%) and 36 (50.7%) patients in ESTEEM 1
and ESTEEM 2, respectively, achieved an improve-
ment in ScPGA score to 0 or 1 at week 32.
Results for period C (weeks 32-52): PASI
responders
In both ESTEEM 1 and ESTEEM 2, continued
improvement in nail psoriasis occurred through
week 52 in PASI responders, which included those
patients initially randomized to apremilast 30 mg BID
or placebo at baseline who had a PASI response
(ESTEEM 1: $ 75% reduction from baseline in PASI
score/ESTEEM 2: $ 50% reduction from baseline in
PASI score) at week 32 and continued to receive
apremilast through week 52 (period C) (Fig 5, A and
B). At week 52, the mean percent reduction from
baseline in target nail NAPSI score in these patients
was approximately 60% to 64%. Among PASI re-
sponders, NAPSI-50 achievement in ESTEEM 1 and
ESTEEM 2 was also generally maintained with
apremilast for up to 52 weeks, regardless of initial
randomization to apremilast 30 mg BID (70.7% and
68.6%, respectively) or placebo (64.1% and 69.0%,
respectively) at baseline. Similarly, among patients
with ScPGA score of 3 or greater at baseline,
achievement of ScPGA score of 0 or 1 was also
maintained with apremilast in both studies at week
52 among PASI responders, regardless of assignment
to apremilast 30 mg BID (83.3% [n = 35/42] in
ESTEEM 1; 62.5% [n = 20/32] in ESTEEM 2) or
placebo (64.1% [n = 25/39] in ESTEEM 1; 53.5%
[n = 23/43] in ESTEEM 2) at baseline.
DISCUSSION
Although the nails and scalp account for a small
percentage of the body surface area, psoriasis in these
areas can have a disproportionate effect on a patient’s
physical and psychosocial function.7,13 Evidence of
the efficacy of available therapies in these difficult-
to-treat areas is limited, underscoring the need
for further clinical evaluation and new treatment
options.23,24 In the ESTEEM 1 and ESTEEM 2 studies,
nail psoriasis and moderate to very severe scalp
psoriasis were present at baseline in approximately
two thirds of patients, emphasizing the prevalence

 of this difficult-to-treat form in patients with moderate
to severe psoriasis. The analyses of the ESTEEM
studies demonstrate that apremilast 30 mg BID
significantly improves nail and scalp psoriasis.
Improvement in nail psoriasis achieved during the
placebo-controlled phase continued through week
32 with apremilast 30 mg BID. These improvements
were sustained in patients who had a PASI response at
week 32 and continued taking apremilast 30 mg BID
through week 52.
Nail psoriasis is particularly difficult to treat and
may be triggered by an inflammatory response as
part of the Koebner phenomenon in patients with
moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis.24,25
Clinical practice recommendations for the treatment
of nail psoriasis, published by the Medical Board
of the National Psoriasis Foundation, recommend
systemic therapies, including apremilast, for patients
with significant skin and nail disease or skin, nail,
and joint disease.8 Improvements in nail psoriasis
tend to lag behind improvements in skin and joint
symptoms, given the time it takes for fingernails to
grow out (ie, 3-4 mm/mo, or 5-7 months for growth
from the nail matrix to the distal fingertip), such that
longer clinical trials are needed to demonstrate
effects on nail psoriasis.8 In ESTEEM, improvements
in both nail bed and nail matrix disease were noted
with apremilast treatment versus placebo at week 16;
improvements continued through week 32 and were
maintained through week 52.

 Studies of systemic therapies for the treatment of
scalp psoriasis are limited. Currently, topical vitamin D
analogs and corticosteroids are typically used to treat
scalp psoriasis, but the long-term effectiveness of
these agentsisoften limited bynonadherencebecause
of the poor cosmetic properties of some topicals and/
or difficulty with application.14 In ESTEEM 1 and 2,
more than 40% of the patients with moderate to very
severe scalp disease at baseline achieved ScPGA score
of 0 or 1 by week 16 with apremilast 30 mg BID, and
this improvement was generally maintained through
week 32. In addition, among patients who achieved a
PASI response at week 32 and continued taking
apremilast 30 mg BID, the majority had ScPGA score
of 0 or 1 after 1 year of treatment.
Apremilast was generally well tolerated in the
ESTEEM studies.20,21,26 Most adverse events were
mild or moderate in severity. The exposure-adjusted
incidence rate of adverse events did not appear to
increase
over
time,
and
no
new
significant
adverse events emerged with continued apremilast
exposure. Changes in laboratory parameters were
transient, with no trends observed.
Although providing clinically useful information,
the analyses reported here from the ESTEEM studies
were limited by the fact that initial randomization
was not stratified by subgroups of patients with nail
and scalp psoriasis to ensure balance between
treatment groups. However, baseline characteristics
among patients with nail psoriasis and scalp psori-
asis appeared similar between treatment groups
in both ESTEEM 1 and ESTEEM 2, such that this
was unlikely to have substantially impacted the
results.

 In conclusion, apremilast 30 mg BID significantly
reduced the severity of nail and scalp psoriasis.
Improvements in nail and scalp psoriasis were
sustained over time. Thus, our findings indicate
that apremilast, a novel oral therapeutic option for
patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, is
an effective option for patients with nail and/or scalp
involvement.
