Abstract
Introduction
The impact of probiotics on dogs with acute hemorrhagic diarrhea syndrome (AHDS) has
not been evaluated so far. The study aim was to assess the effect of probiotic treatment on
the clinical course, intestinal microbiome, and toxigenic Clostridium perfringens in dogs with
AHDS in a prospective, placebo-controlled, blinded trial.
Methods
Twenty-five dogs with AHDS with no signs of sepsis were randomly divided into a probiotic
(PRO; Visbiome, ExeGi Pharma) and placebo group (PLAC). Treatment was administered
for 21 days without antibiotics. Clinical signs were evaluated daily from day 0 to day 8. Key
bacterial taxa, C. perfringens encoding NetF toxin and enterotoxin were assessed on days
0, 7, 21.
Results
Both groups showed a rapid clinical improvement. In PRO a significant clinical recovery was
observed on day 3 (p = 0.008), while in PLAC it was observed on day 4 (p = 0.002) com-
pared to day 0. Abundance of Blautia (p<0.001) and Faecalibacterium (p = 0.035) was
significantly higher in PRO on day 7 compared to day 0, while in PLAC the abundance of
Faecalibacterium was not significantly higher on any study day and Blautia (p = 0.016) was
only significantly higher on day 21 compared to day 0. Abundance of C. perfringens was sig-
nificantly lower on day 7 (p = 0.011) compared to day 0 in PRO but not in PLAC. Enterotoxin
genes were significantly lower in PRO on day 21 (p = 0.028) compared to PLAC. Fecal sam-
ples of 57% of all dogs were positive for netF toxin genes on day 0 and the abundance was
significantly lower on day 7 compared to day 0 in PRO (p = 0.016) and PLAC (p = 0.031).

 Conclusion
The probiotic treatment was associated with an accelerated normalization of the intestinal
microbiome. Dogs with aseptic AHDS showed a rapid decrease of netF toxin genes and fast
clinical recovery in both groups under symptomatic treatment without antibiotics.
Introduction
Acute hemorrhagic diarrhea syndrome (AHDS) is a common complaint in dogs presented to
primary care veterinarians. The etiology is not fully understood, but there is strong evidence
that C. perfringens and its toxins play a role in the pathogenesis and are responsible for the
intestinal lesions in most dogs diagnosed with AHDS [1]. An increase in fecal abundance of
enterotoxigenic C. perfringens has been associated with acute non-hemorrhagic as well as with
hemorrhagic diarrhea [2, 3]. Nevertheless, there was no difference found in severity of clinical
or laboratory parameters between dogs with AHDS that were either positive or negative for C.
perfringens encoding enterotoxin [3]. Recently, novel pore-forming toxins designated as NetE
and NetF were identified in a C. perfringens type A strain isolated from a dog with acute hem-
orrhagic diarrhea, and the cytotoxic effect of NetF could be demonstrated in vitro [4]. In addi-
tion, there is a significantly higher prevalence of C. perfringens encoding NetF toxin (netF) in
canine AHDS isolates compared to undifferentiated canine diarrheal isolates [4], and a prelim-
inary study also showed a significant higher abundance of netF in dogs with AHDS compared
to healthy dogs or dogs with parvovirosis [5].
The clinical picture of AHDS is characterized by acute onset of hemorrhagic diarrhea, leth-
argy, dehydration, and anorexia. Due to massive fluid loss, dogs with AHDS quickly develop
hypovolemia, which can be potentially life threatening when untreated. Usually, a rapid clini-
cal improvement under symptomatic treatment with aggressive fluid therapy, antiemetic ther-
apy, analgetics, and gastrointestinal diet can be seen. Short-term prognosis is considered good
after successful treatment of hypovolemia, while long-term consequences of the severe muco-
sal damage in dogs with AHDS are currently not known. Two individual studies have shown
that treatment with antibiotics has no significant influence on mortality rate, duration of hos-
pitalization, and clinical signs, and antibiotic treatment should be restricted to dogs with signs
of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or inadequate response to symptomatic
therapy [6, 7]. This is even more of interest since antibiotic treatment can cause acute alter-
ations in the intestinal microbiome and some bacterial taxa even remain altered for months
after antibiotic treatment [8, 9]. Moreover, inappropriate use of antibiotics promotes the devel-
opment of antimicrobial resistance, which poses a major problem in health care [10].
Dogs with AHDS have alterations in the intestinal microbiome, for example increases in C.
perfringens-like sequences and Fusobacteria and decreases in Actinobacteria and members
within the Firmicutes (Ruminococcaceae, Blautia spp.) [11, 12].
Recently, a quantitative PCR-based dysbiosis index (DI) was developed to identify dysbiosis
in canine fecal samples and this assay also allows to track microbiota changes over time [13].
The DI quantifies the abundance of total bacteria as well as of seven bacterial taxa (i.e. Faecali-
bacterium, Turicibacter, E. coli, Streptococcus, Blautia, Fusobacterium and C. hiranonis) shown
to be altered in dogs with gastrointestinal disease in previous sequencing and qPCR-based
studies. A recent study in dogs with multicentric lymphoma showed that the DI reflects the
microbiota dysbiosis similarly as whole microbiota analysis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing
[14]. The DI has been shown to be reproducible and provides a reference interval, based on

 assessment of the fecal microbiota of 95 healthy dogs [13]. The DI is expressed as a single
numeric value and has shown to be negative in healthy dogs (mean DI -4.8) and positive in
dogs with gastrointestinal disease (mean DI 3.3 in dogs with chronic enteropathy) indicating
dysbiosis. However, it has been shown that there is an overlap of dysbiosis patterns between
healthy dogs and dogs with gastrointestinal disease, which is why dogs with gastrointestinal
disease may have normal microbiota and therefore negative DI.
Currently it is unclear whether the microbiota changes are in part causal or an effect of
the disease, but it is believed that intestinal dysbiosis plays a role in the pathophysiology of
acute and chronic disorders. Thus, a rapid normalization of microbiota dysbiosis might be
beneficial.
Probiotics are orally administered live microorganisms which, when administered in ade-
quate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host (FAO/WHO 2001). The exact mechanisms
of probiotics are presently not fully understood, but several studies suggest that probiotics
have different beneficial effects on host health, such as immunomodulation, anti-inflammatory
properties or competition for nutrients or adhesion sites with potential pathogens [15, 16].
The effects of a probiotic possibly depend on the probiotic strain, mixture and concentration.
A previous study for instance showed varying microbial changes in kenneled dogs depending
on the dosage of the probiotic treatment [17]. Several studies showed an improvement in clini-
cal signs by probiotic treatment such as causing significant decreased incidence of diarrhea in
sheltered dogs and a significant reduction in duration of uncomplicated acute diarrhea in dogs
[18–20]. Dogs with idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease treated with probiotics in addition
to standard therapy showed an enhancement of regulatory T-cell markers, normalization of
dysbiosis, and up-regulated expression of tight junction proteins [21, 22]. One study investi-
gated the effect of probiotic treatment on dogs with hemorrhagic diarrhea due to parvovirosis
and observed a more rapid improvement in clinical signs as well as in leukocyte counts in
dogs additionally treated with probiotics [23]. However, to our knowledge there are no studies
on probiotic treatment in dogs with AHDS and its impact on clinical signs and intestinal
microbiota.
Thus, the aim of this prospective, placebo-controlled, randomized, blinded study was to
evaluate whether treatment with a probiotic has an impact on the clinical course, the intestinal
microbiome, and the presence and abundance of C. perfringens and C. perfringens encoding
enterotoxin and NetF toxin in dogs with AHDS that show no signs of sepsis.
Material & methods
Patients
This study was a prospective, placebo-controlled, randomized, blinded treatment trial. It was
conducted according to the German animal welfare law (approved by Ethics Commission,
Centre for Clinical Veterinary Medicine, LMU Munich, Germany; reference number 9-20-06-
13). Owners were informed about the purpose of the study, and all owners signed a written
consent form. Between October 2013 and March 2015, 84 dogs were presented with acute
hemorrhagic diarrhea to the Clinic of Small Animal Medicine, LMU University of Munich,
Germany. AHDS was diagnosed by ruling out any disease that can potentially cause hemor-
rhagic diarrhea. Inclusion criterion to enter the study was the presence of acute onset of hem-
orrhagic diarrhea with or without vomiting lasting less than three days. Fig 1 illustrates the
standardized examination process and exclusion criteria as well as the further course of the
study as a flow-chart. Exclusion criteria were underlying diseases causing hemorrhagic diar-
rhea, pre-treatment with drugs known to cause mucosal irritation (e.g., non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, doxycycline) one week before presentation, or pre-

 treatment with antibiotics. Dogs diagnosed with AHDS but potential signs of sepsis (rectal
temperature >39.50˚C, white blood cell (WBC) count <4 or >25 x 109/L, band neutrophil
count >1.5 x 109/L) were also excluded.
Therefore, a standardized history and physical examination were taken, and various tests
performed.
Blood tests.
A complete blood count (CBC), serum biochemistry profile, serum concen-
trations of pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (Spec cPL, IDEXX Laboratories, Ludwigsburg,
Germany) and clotting profiles if required (packed cell volume <40% or suspicious history or
physical examination) were evaluated. A parvovirus PCR (IDEXX Laboratories, Ludwigsburg,
Germany) was performed in dogs in which an infection was considered likely (young age,
incomplete vaccination history, neutropenia). Baseline cortisol (IDEXX Laboratories, Lud-
wigsburg, Germany) concentration was measured to rule out Addison’s disease in dogs with
lack of a stress leukogram and hyponatremia and/or hyperkalaemia.
Fecal examination.
Flotation for nematodes and protozoan parasites (29.5% sodium
nitrate flotation solution, Janssen-Cilag, Neuss, Germany) and a Giardia antigen ELISA (ProS-
pecT Giardia Microplate Assay; Remel Inc, Lenexa, KS) were evaluated.

 Additional tests. Abdominal ultrasound was performed and urine specific gravity was
measured in case of azotaemia.
Treatment
Dogs (n = 25) that fulfilled the enrolment criteria were randomized by means of a computer-
generated schedule into a probiotic group (PRO; n = 13) and a placebo group (PLAC; n = 12).
Patients in PLAC received an orally administered placebo powder (maltose with trace amounts
of silicon dioxide) packed in sachets and patients in PRO received a high potency, multi strain,
orally administered probiotic powder every 24 hours for 21 days packed in sachets containing
450 billion cfu each. The placebo or probiotic powder was given orally either over food in dogs
with appetite or diluted in water administered with a 5 mL syringe in anorectic patients. The
probiotic mixture contained the following live bacterial strains: Lactobacillus plantarum DSM
24730, Streptococcus thermophilus DSM 24731, Bifidobacterium breve DSM 24732, Lactobacil-
lus paracasei DSM 24733, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus DSM 24734, Lactobacillus
acidophilus DSM 24735, Bifidobacterium longum 120 DSM 24736, and Bifidobacterium infantis
DSM 24737 in the specific combination which is currently sold under the brand Vivomixx in
Continental Europe and Visbiome in the USA and Canada. According to the manufacturer,
each strain in the probiotic blend was individually cultured and then filtered to separate the
bacteria from the culture medium. The concentrated culture was then lyophilized for each
strain separately. The finished product was shipped to the clinic and stored under refrigerated
conditions to ensure product potency (4–8˚C). Dosing was based on body weight: 225 billion
colony forming units (cfu) for 1–10 kg dogs; 450 billion cfu for 10–20 kg dogs; 900 billion cfu
for 20–40 kg dogs for 21 days on a daily basis.
Additional therapy during hospitalization was standardized and equal for both groups. It
consisted of fluid therapy (crystalloids; amount depended on dehydration, maintenance
demands, and ongoing losses) and antiemetics (maropitant 1 mg/kg SC q24 h; Cerenia, Pfi-
zer Pharma GmbH) in case of vomiting. Analgetics were administered if required (bupre-
norphine 0.01 mg/kg intravenous every 6 hours or every 8 hours; Vetergesic Multidose,
Patheon UK, Swindon, UK). A gastrointestinal diet (Royal Canin, Gastro Intestinal) was
fed during hospitalization and owners were instructed to continue the diet until day 21 at
home.
Evaluation of clinical signs
Day 0 was defined as the day of clinical presentation and study inclusion. For eight days, clini-
cal signs were assessed and quantified by a clinician during hospitalization or the owner at
home using the canine hemorrhagic diarrhea severity index (CHDSI, Table 1). The CHDSI
includes the parameters activity, appetite, vomiting (times/day), fecal consistency, defecation
(times/day), and admixture of blood in the stool. Each parameter was scored from 0 to 3, and
the sum of scores yielded a total cumulative score. On days with no bowel movement, the fecal
consistency and defecation (times/day) were scored as zero. Clinicians as well as owners were
blinded to the treatment. Only dogs showing normal activity and appetite, no vomiting, no
dehydration, and no watery diarrhea (only dogs with normal, slightly soft or very soft fecal
consistency; equivalent to a score of 0–2 according to the CHDSI) were discharged from the
hospital.
Analysis of fecal microbiota
Fecal samples collected on day 0, day 7, and day 21 were used for analysis of the fecal micro-
biota. Fecal DNA was extracted as described previously [13]. Briefly, an aliquot of 100 mg (wet

 weight) of each fecal sample was extracted by a bead-beating method using a MoBio Power
soil DNA isolation kit (MoBio Laboratories, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Quantitative PCR assays (qPCR) for key bacterial taxa that are altered in dogs with gastrointes-
tinal disease (i.e., total bacteria, Faecalibacterium, Turicibacter, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus,
Blautia, Fusobacterium and Clostridium hiranonis) were performed as previously described
[13, 24]. PCR was also used to quantify the abundance of C. perfringens and the abundance of
the genes encoding enterotoxin as described previously [2]. For quantification of genes encod-
ing netF, primers were used as described previously [4]. The oligonucleotide sequences of
primers and probes, and respective annealing temperatures are summarized in S1 Table. PCR
conditions were 95˚C for 20 seconds, 40 cycles at 95˚C for 5 seconds, and 10 seconds at the
optimized annealing temperature. For probe based assays, the mastermix consisted of 10 μL of
TaqMan reaction mixtures containing 5 μL of TaqMan Fast Universal PCR master mix (2×),
No AmpErase UNG (Applied Biosystems), 1 μL of water, 0.4 μL of each primer (final concen-
tration: 400 nM), 0.2 μL of the probe (final concentration: 200 nM), 1 μL of 1% bovine serum
albumin (BSA, final concentration: 0.1%), and 2 μL of DNA (1: 10 or 1: 100 dilution). For
SYBR based assays PCR conditions were 95˚C for 2 minutes, and 40 cycles at 95˚C 5 seconds
and 10 seconds at the optimized annealing temperature (S1 Table) with 10 μL of SYBR-based
reaction mixtures containing 5 μL of SsoFast EvaGreen supermix (Biorad Laboratories), 1.6 μL
of water, 0.4 μL of each primer (final concentration: 400 nM), 1 μL of 1% BSA (final concentra-
tion: 0.1%), and 2 μL of DNA (1:10 or 1:100 dilution). The qPCR results were expressed as the
log amount of DNA (fg) for each bacterial group/10 ng of isolated total DNA. The results of
the qPCR assays were statistically analyzed for individual taxa as well as expressed as single
numerical value, the Dysbiosis Index (DI). A negative DI indicates normobiosis, whereas a
positive DI indicates dysbiosis [13].
Statistical analysis
The data for the qPCR assays, the CHDSI and signalment (age, gender, weight, breed) were
tested for normal distribution using D’Agostino & Pearson omnibus normality tests. Group
comparisons of data for the qPCR assays were performed using either an unpaired t-test
or Mann-Whitney tests as appropriate. Comparisons within a group between time points
were performed using either a paired t-test or Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test as
appropriate. Friedman test and Dunn’s multiple comparison test were used for comparison
of CHDSI between time points among groups. Chi-square test was used for comparing pro-
portions of dogs positive for netF toxin gene and enterotoxin gene. Significance was set at
p<0.05. All statistics were performed in GraphPad Prism 7.0c (GraphPad Software Inc., San
Diego, USA).

 Results
Animals
Of the 84 dogs presented with hemorrhagic diarrhea during the study period, 59 patients were
excluded from the study, due to various reasons (Fig 1). Seven of 84 dogs (8.3%) were excluded
because they were pre-treated with antibiotics at time of presentation. Twenty-three (27.4%)
were excluded because they were treated with antibiotics during hospitalization due to either
signs of sepsis (n = 15/84; 17.9%), cystitis (n = 2/84; 2.4%), colitis (1/84; 1.2%), or unknown
reasons (n = 5/84; 6.0%). Twenty dogs (23.8%) needed to be excluded because of compliance
issues with owners (i.e., dogs would have fulfilled the inclusion criteria but owners were not
willing to participate in the study initially or did not comply fecal sample collection during
the study). Five dogs (6.0%) were tested positive for various parasites (e.g. Toxacara canis,
Giardia, Cryposporidia), two dogs (2.4%) had a positive PCR result for parvovirosis, one dog
(1.2%) was diagnosed with pancreatitis, and in one dog (1.2%) sudden death occurred during
initial examination.
Twenty-five of 84 dogs (29.8%) were diagnosed with acute hemorrhagic diarrhea syndrome
and eligible to enter the study. They were randomly divided into two groups, PRO (n = 13)
and PLAC (n = 12) by means of a computer-generated schedule. The mean (SD) age in PRO
was 6.0 years (3.9) while it was 5.5 years (3.9) in PLAC. No significant differences in age
(p = 0.748), gender (p = 0.561), body weight (p = 0.397) or breed distribution (p = 0.390) were
found between the two groups.
CHDS index (CHDSI)
On day 0, mean (SD) CHDSI in PRO was 13 (3.2) and in PLAC it was 13 (3.4), which was not
significantly different between groups (p = 0.980) (Fig 2). Compared to day 0, there was a sig-
nificantly lower CHDSI observed on day 3 (p = 0.008) in PRO with mean CHDSI of 5.0 (3.0).
In PLAC there was a significant lower CHDSI observed on day 4 (p = 0.002) compared to day
0 with mean CHDSI of 5.2 (2.8). After day 6, the mean CHDSI stayed below 3 in both groups,
indicating clinically insignificant signs according to the CHDSI. There were no further signifi-
cant differences observed between PRO and PLAC on any study day.
Fecal microbiota
On day 0, the abundances of Faecalibacterium, Turicibacter, E. coli, Streptococcus, Blautia,
Fusobacterium, and C. hiranonis were not significantly different between PRO and PLAC
(Table 2; Fig 3). In PRO the abundances of Blautia (p<0.001), C. hiranonis (p = 0.001), Strepto-
coccus (p = 0.001), Faecalibacterium (p = 0.035) and Turicibacter (p = 0.037) were significantly
higher on day 7 compared to day 0. In contrast, in PLAC there was a significantly higher abun-
dance of Blautia (p = 0.016), C. hiranonis (p = 0.014) and Turicibacter (p = 0.008) only seen on
day 21 compared to day 0. There was no significantly higher abundance of Streptococcus and
Faecalibacterium in PLAC on any study day compared to day 0. Additionally, dogs in PRO
had a significantly higher abundance of C. hiranonis (p = 0.014), Streptococcus (p = 0.013) and
Faecalibacterium (p = 0.018) compared to PLAC on day 7. No significant changes over time
within groups or between groups were observed for E. coli and Fusobacterium (Table 2). The
baseline dysbiosis index (DI) was not significantly different (p = 0.567) between PRO and
PLAC (Fig 3). On day 0, 4/13 dogs (31%) in PRO and 4/10 dogs (40%) in PLAC had a DI
above 0. The DI showed a decreasing tendency with 3/13 dogs (23%) in PRO, 3/12 dogs (25%)
in PLAC having a DI above 0 on day 7. After day 7, only one dog in PLAC had a DI above 0 on

 number of dogs positive for enterotoxin genes was not significantly different between groups
(7/13 positive in PRO vs. 6/12 in PLAC; p = 0.695). On day 21, the abundance of enterotoxin
genes was significantly lower in PRO compared to PLAC (p = 0.028). Proportions of dogs posi-
tive for enterotoxin encoding C. perfringens strains were also significantly lower in dogs receiv-
ing probiotic on day 21 (1/10 positive in PRO vs. 5/8 in PLAC; p = 0.019).

On day 0, a total of 13/23 (57%) dogs were positive for netF and there was no significant differ-
ence in number of dogs positive for netF between groups (7/13 positive in PRO vs. 6/10 posi-
tive in PLAC, p = 0.768). Additionally, the baseline abundance of netF was not significantly
different (p = 0.764) between PRO and PLAC (Fig 4). The abundance of netF was significantly
lower on day 7 compared to baseline in both PRO (p = 0.016) and PLAC (p = 0.031). After day
7 all dogs except one in PLAC on day 21, were below the detection limit of the PCR assay for
netF. There was no significant difference in abundance or number of dogs positive for netF
between groups on any study day.
Discussion
The aim of this study was to evaluate whether probiotic treatment has an impact on the clinical
course, the intestinal microbiome and the abundance of C. perfringens and toxigenic C. perfrin-
gens in dogs with AHDS. Therefore, dogs with hemorrhagic diarrhea lasting less than three
days were included in this trial. Dogs with an underlying disease possibly responsible for hem-
orrhagic diarrhea or dogs with potential signs of sepsis at clinical presentation or during the
study were excluded. Dogs in the probiotic group received a high potency, multi strain, orally
administered probiotic powder, which was chosen based on previous studies demonstrating
upregulated expression of tight junction proteins and clinical response in dogs with IBD [21,
22].
Acute hemorrhagic diarrhea syndrome is characterized by its self-limiting rapid course and
has a good short-term prognosis when treated symptomatically [7, 25]. We observed that all
dogs that fulfilled the inclusion criteria indeed showed a rapid clinical improvement within a

 few days. Based on the CHDSI, dogs in both groups were considered to have mild signs already
after 4 days and both groups had clinically insignificant signs after only 6 days (mean CHDSI
below 3). These results correspond to the findings in previous studies [7, 25]. We observed
that a significant recovery in PRO was already seen on day 3, while in PLAC it was seen on
day 4 compared to baseline. No further differences in severity or duration of clinical signs
between PRO and PLAC were seen. Since dogs with aseptic AHDS usually show a rapid clini-
cal improvement, more significant differences in clinical signs between treatment groups
might have been difficult to detect even if they were documented on a daily basis as performed
in this study.
Many practitioners still administer antibiotics to dogs with acute hemorrhagic diarrhea
even if patients do not show any signs of sepsis. In our study, 15 of the 84 dogs (17.9%) with
acute hemorrhagic diarrhea were not included in the study since they showed signs that poten-
tially reflect sepsis. A definitive diagnosis of sepsis in dogs with AHDS is difficult, since there
is a significant overlap concerning criteria for sepsis and hypovolemia. Individual dogs with
AHDS are still at risk to develop sepsis, likely due to bacterial translocation because of a dam-
aged intestinal barrier. Of particular interest is the fact that the dogs in our study that had no
signs of sepsis showed a rapid improvement under symptomatic therapy, and all dogs returned
to a normal stool consistency and frequency within a few days without antibiotic treatment.
This emphasizes the findings of previous studies, which showed that antibiotic therapy yields
no advantages compared to symptomatic therapy in dogs with acute diarrhea as long as the
patients do not show signs of sepsis [6, 7]. This is even more of interest, since bacterial resis-
tances are an increasing problem in public health care and unnecessary use of antibiotics
should be avoided [26, 27].
The intestinal tract of healthy dogs is inhabited by a diverse intestinal microbiota with Fir-
micutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Fusobacteria being the predominant bacterial phyla.
The intestinal microbiota plays an important role in host health by contributing to many dif-
ferent pathways, such as producing metabolites like short chain fatty acids or by participating
in bile acid conversion [28–31]. Moreover, a crosstalk between gut microbiota and host
immune cells exists, enabled by microbial-derived metabolites and bacterial surface molecules
[32]. It has been shown that dogs with acute hemorrhagic diarrhea have alterations in their
intestinal microbiome. Bacterial taxa most commonly altered include increases in C. perfrin-
gens and E. coli, and decreases in Blautia, Turicibacter, Faecalibacterium, and Streptococcus spp.
compared to healthy dogs [11, 12, 33]. Recently, a quantitative PCR-based dysbiosis index (DI)
was developed to quantify these specific bacterial groups and combine them numerically into
one single number to assess fecal dysbiosis in canine fecal samples [13]. A negative DI indicates
normobiosis, whereas a positive DI indicates dysbiosis. On day 0, 31% of dogs in PRO and
40% of dogs in PLAC had a DI above zero, indicating intestinal dysbiosis. Overall, the DI
showed a similar tendency to decrease in both groups reflecting normalization of the intestinal
microbiota. Within 21 days, all dogs except one dog in PLAC returned to a negative DI indi-
cating intestinal normobiosis. These findings suggest that AHDS is a self-limiting syndrome
not only regarding clinical signs but also regarding the intestinal microbiome.
Species belonging to the genus Blautia are involved in glucose metabolism, producing
metabolites like acetate, ethanol, hydrogen, lactate and succinate [34], and Blautia represent
about 8.9–25.2% (median 14.0%) of the intestinal bacteria [12]. Studies in humans have shown
that a decreased abundance of Blautia is accompanied with negative effects on host health,
such as negative prognostic factors in early-stage breast cancer or higher graft-versus-host dis-
ease related mortality [35, 36]. C. hiranonis is considered to be a beneficial bacterium that
plays a role in bile acid conversion [28] while Turicibacter is likely to play a role in the metabo-
lism of butyric acid [37]. Faecalibacterium was shown to have anti-inflammatory properties

 and human inflammatory bowel disease and infectious colitis were associated with low counts
of Faecalibacterium [38, 39]. Blautia have a mean abundance of 9.7 log DNA, C. hiranonis a
mean abundance of 6.4 log DNA, Faecalibacterium a mean abundance of 6.2 log DNA and
Turicibacter a mean abundance of 6.1 log DNA per gram of feces as described in 95 healthy
dogs using the same PCR techniques [13]. In veterinary medicine, previous studies observed a
significant decrease in Blautia, Faecalibacterium and Turicibacter in dogs with acute hemor-
rhagic and non-hemorrhagic diarrhea [3, 11, 12]. Consistent to those previous findings, in our
study we observed a reduced mean abundance of Blautia, Faecalibacterium and Turicibacter
(Table 2) on day 0 according to the reference intervals set by AlShawaqfeh et al. In dogs treated
with the probiotic we observed a higher abundance of Blautia, Faecalibacterium, Turicibacter,
C. hiranonis and Streptococcus on day 7 compared to baseline while in dogs treated with pla-
cebo a higher abundance was only seen on day 21 or on no study day at all (Fig 3).
C. perfringens is a commensal of the intestinal tract and can be found in up to 76% in the
faces of healthy non-diarrheic dogs [2, 40, 41]. It has been shown that dogs with acute hemor-
rhagic and non-hemorrhagic diarrhea have a significantly higher abundance of C. perfringens
[2], while dogs with IBD do not have a significantly higher abundance compared to healthy
dogs [11]. Moreover, the abundance of C. perfringens encoding enterotoxin and the prevalence
of dogs positive for enterotoxin itself via ELISA toxin immunoassay are significantly higher
in dogs with acute diarrhea than in healthy dogs [2]. However, C. perfringens enterotoxin is
unlikely to be the primary cause of AHDS, since there was no difference found in severity of
clinical signs, duration of hospitalization or laboratory parameters between dogs positive or
negative for C. perfringens encoding enterotoxin based on PCR assays [3]. Additionally, there
was no difference seen in dogs being positive or negative for enterotoxin itself based on ELISA
toxin immunoassay data [3]. In this study, we detected a significantly lower abundance of C.
perfringens in PRO compared to baseline on day 7, whereas there was no significant lower
abundance in PLAC on any day compared to day 0. Proportions of dogs positive as well as the
abundance of C. perfringens encoding enterotoxin were significantly lower in dogs receiving
probiotic on day 21 in comparison to dogs that received placebo. These findings suggest that
probiotic treatment in this study was associated with an increase of beneficial bacteria such
as Blautia, C. hiranonis, Streptococcus, Faecalibacterium and Turicibacter and an accelerated
decrease of possible pathogenic bacteria like C. perfringens. We did not examine the exact
mechanisms of how the probiotic mixture affected the intestinal microbiota in this study. Pro-
biotic bacterial strains can modulate the immune system and enhance intestinal barrier func-
tion through different mechanisms of action. Studies reported a response of the gut associated
lymphoid tissue (GALT) following the administration of L. plantarum and L. acidophilus [42,
43]. Also antibody production such as IgA from plasma cells, which protect the host by bind-
ing several antigens were observed following treatment with B. lactis strains [44]. Moreover,
previous studies observed that Lactobacillus strains (L. acidophilus and L. fermentum) are able
to inhibit the growth of C. perfringens in vitro. This inhibition was not only caused by lowering
the pH level, as C. perfringens is a pH sensitive bacterium, but also likely due to bacteriocin
production by L. acidophilus and L. fermentum [45, 46]. The probiotic mixture used in our
study may be associated with an increase of beneficial bacteria and decrease of possible patho-
genic bacteria due to similar mechanisms. The formula of the probiotic used in our study con-
tains a higher concentration of bacteria compared to several other probiotic products, which
may have promoted this effect. Further research is warranted to elucidate the mechanisms of
action of probiotics in dogs with AHDS.
The novel pore-forming cytotoxic toxin NetF was recently isolated from a dog with acute
hemorrhagic diarrhea [4]. The study observed a highly significant association between the
presence of C. perfringens encoding NetF toxin and canine hemorrhagic diarrhea compared to

 undifferentiated enteritis and 75% of the isolates from hemorrhagic diarrhea were positive for
netF [4]. In our study, we observed that 57% of all dogs that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were
positive for netF at time of clinical presentation. NetF decreased rapidly, and after day 7 all
dogs, except one dog in PLAC on day 21, were below the detection limit of the PCR assay.
Since both groups showed a rapid decrease, it is likely that the NetF toxemia in dogs with hem-
orrhagic diarrhea is self-limiting and parallels clinical improvement.
A limitation of this study is the small sample size of 25 dogs. Future studies with a higher
sample size could provide more detailed data regarding the changes in microbiome and may
also be able to detect more significant differences in the clinical course. Additionally, a more
frequent analysis of fecal samples, especially in the first days after clinical presentation, could
have offered a more precise insight on the course of the intestinal microbiome in dogs with
AHDS treated with the probiotic. A possible limitation also may be that we did not perform a
whole screening of the intestinal microbiome. Reasons for not performing a sequencing-based
approach was that we employed reproducible qPCR assays that targeted those bacterial groups
previously found to be altered in canine gastrointestinal disease, including AHDS. Addition-
ally, we also did not perform a toxin immunoassay for C. perfringens enterotoxin, as the com-
mercially available immunoassay has not been validated for use in dogs. To our knowledge, no
immunoassay is available for measurement of NetF toxin.
In conclusion, the results of this study show that aseptic AHDS is characterized by its
rapid self-limiting course regarding clinical signs and the presence of netF toxin genes. Both
groups recovered quickly with a significant improvement on day 3 in the probiotic group
and day 4 in placebo group compared to day of clinical presentation. Dogs receiving probiotic
treatment also showed an accelerated normalization of Blautia, C. hiranonis, Faecalibacterium,
and Turicibacter compared to dogs that were only treated symptomatically. Additionally, the
abundance of C. perfringens encoding enterotoxin was significantly lower in dogs receiving
probiotics.
