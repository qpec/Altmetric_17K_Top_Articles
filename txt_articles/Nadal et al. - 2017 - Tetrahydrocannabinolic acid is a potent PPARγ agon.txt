BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
Phytocannabinoids are produced in Cannabis sativa L. in acidic form and are decarboxylated upon heating, processing and
storage. While the biological effects of decarboxylated cannabinoids such as Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol have been extensively
investigated, the bioactivity of Δ9-tetahydrocannabinol acid (Δ9-THCA) is largely unknown, despite its occurrence in different
Cannabis preparations. Here we have assessed possible neuroprotective actions of Δ9-THCA through modulation of PPARγ
pathways.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH
The effects of six phytocannabinoids on PPARγ binding and transcriptional activity were investigated. The effect of Δ9-THCA on
mitochondrial biogenesis and PPARγ coactivator 1-α expression was investigated in Neuro-2a (N2a) cells. The neuroprotective
effect was analysed in STHdhQ111/Q111 cells expressing a mutated form of the huntingtin protein and in N2a cells infected with an
adenovirus carrying human huntingtin containing 94 polyQ repeats (mHtt-q94). The in vivo neuroprotective activity of Δ9-THCA
was investigated in mice intoxicated with the mitochondrial toxin 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NPA).
KEY RESULTS
Cannabinoid acids bind and activate PPARγ with higher potency than their decarboxylated products. Δ9-THCA increased
mitochondrial mass in neuroblastoma N2a cells and prevented cytotoxicity induced by serum deprivation in STHdhQ111/Q111 cells
and by mutHtt-q94 in N2a cells. Δ9-THCA, through a PPARγ-dependent pathway, was neuroprotective in mice treated with
3-NPA, improving motor deficits and preventing striatal degeneration. In addition, Δ9-THCA attenuated microgliosis, astrogliosis
and up-regulation of proinflammatory markers induced by 3-NPA.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
Δ9-THCA shows potent neuroprotective activity, which is worth considering for the treatment of Huntington’s disease and
possibly other neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases.

 Introduction
The first phytocannabinoid (cannabinol) was isolated from
Cannabis in 1896 (Wodd et al., 1896), but more than 50 years
elapsed before it was realized that these compounds are
produced and stored in the plant as their acidic precursors
(cannabinoid acids or pre-cannabinoids) (Krejci and Santavy,
1955). Decarboxylation requires heating, but can take place
also at room temperature upon prolonged storage of Cannabis
(Wang et al., 2016). Interestingly, decarboxylation does not
take place to an appreciable extent after absorption, and this
observation
has
found
application
in
forensic
science
to distinguish between the presence of Δ9-tetrahydrocan-
nabinol (Δ9-THC) following recreational consumption of
marijuana
products
and
that
following
the
medicinal
use of dronabinol (Marinol®), a formulation of Δ9-THC
in sesame oil. Surpisingly, the acidic precursor of Δ9-THC,
Δ9-tetahydrocannabinol acid (Δ9-THCA) is not psychotro-
pic, and its binding to cannabinoid receptors is still a
matter of debate (Ahmed et al., 2008; Rosenthaler et al.,
2014). Our interest in native phytocannabinoids was particu-
larly taken by this separation between the narcotic and the
molecular properties of Δ9-THCA and by the discovery that
amorfrutins, a series of phenethyl-type phytocannabinoids
from liverworts and some leguminous plants, potently
modulate the activity of PPARγ. Moreover, carboxylated
amorfrutins are more potent PPARγ agonists than their
decarboxylated neutral analogues (Fuhr et al., 2015).
PPARγ, a nuclear receptor, is a master regulator of
lipid metabolism and glucose homeostasis (Tontonoz and
Spiegelman, 2008). However, PPARγ is expressed in many
different tissues and cell types and plays a key role in inflam-
matory processes and neurodegenerative diseases including
Huntington’s disease (HD) (Quintanilla et al., 2014). In this
sense, it has been shown that glitazones, a class of PPARγ
ligands used as anti-diabetic drugs, are neuroprotective
in
mutant
huntingtin
(mHtt)-expressing
cells,
reduce
mHtt aggregates in the brain, protect from mHtt-induced
striatal neurodegeneration, attenuate neuroinflammation
and decrease oxidative damage (Chiang et al., 2012, 2015;
Jin et al., 2013), thus supporting the concept that PPARγ
may be a valid target for the management of HD (Skerrett
et al., 2014). Moreover, the cannabigerol (CBG) derivative
VCE-003.2 exerted a pro-survival action in progenitor cells
during neuronal differentiation through a PPARγ-dependent
pathway.
This
synthetic
cannabinoid
also
prevented
the loss of medium spiny neurones in Huntington’s-like
disease models in mice, improving motor deficits, reactive
astrogliosis and microglial activation (Diaz-Alonso et al.,
2016). It has also been suggested that an impaired activity
of PPARγ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), a transcriptional master
coregulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and cellular metabo-
lism, may be a pathological factor causing mitochondrial
dysfunction in HD (Johri et al., 2013). Taken together, these
studies support the view that PPARγ agonists may have
beneficial effects on mitochondrial dysfunction, contribut-
ing to the prevention of neurodegeneration in HD (Skerrett
et al., 2014; Agarwal et al., 2017).
Here,
we
have
compared
the
three
major
phytocannabinoids from Cannabis [Δ9-THC, cannabidiol
(CBD) and CBG] and their corresponding acidic precursors
[Δ9-THCA, cannabidiol acid (CBDA) and cannabigerol acid
(CBGA), respectively] as agonists of PPARγ. Our results have
highlighted the therapeutic potential of Δ9-THCA and
botanical preparations containing acidic cannabinoids for
the treatment of HD disease and possibly other neurodegen-
erative, metabolic and inflammatory diseases.
Methods
Cannabinoids and botanical preparations
Δ9-THC and Δ9-THCA were purified from the Cannabis variety
MONIEK (CPVO/20160114), and CBDA was purified from the
variety SARA (CPVO/20150098) using a countercurrent
chromatography. CBD was also purified from SARA variety
and
CBG
and
CBGA
from
the
variety
AIDA
(CPVO/
20160167) following a method described previously (Nadal,
2016). All the cannabinoids have a purity >95%. An extract
containing acidic cannabinoids was prepared from the
variety MONIEK (100 g dry weight) by n-hexane extraction
(1 × 1 L and 2 × 0.75 L), filtration and evaporation. A portion
of the extract was decarboxylated in an oven at 120°C for 1 h
to obtain the
corresponding extract
based
on neutral
cannabinoids. The content of cannabinoids was evaluated
by GC on an Agilent 7890B GC apparatus interfaced with a
5977B mass selective detector. The latter was equipped with
a 15 m × 0.25 mm i.d. Rxi-35Sil_MS capillary column
(0.25 μm film thickness). For the simultaneous measure of
neutral and acidic cannabinoids, a derivatization process
was carried out. Thus, aliquots of the hexane extracts were
transferred to a clean tube, evaporated to dryness and
then derivatized with bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide
containing 2% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) at 70°C for
60 min. After cooling to room temperature, the TMCS deriva-
tives were analysed by GC-MS. The cannabinoid content in
both extracts is shown in Table 1. Cannabinoids were
dissolved in DMSO to provide stock solutions of 50 mM and
were stored at �80°C.

 L-glutamine and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin. HEK-293T
and N2a cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmo-
sphere containing 5% CO2 and STHdhQ7/Q7 and STHdhQ111/Q111
cells, which express either a wild-type or a mutated form of the
huntingtin protein, were cultured at 33°C (Trettel et al., 2000).
PP
ARγ binding and transcriptional assays
PPARγ binding activity was studied using the PolarScreen™
PPARγ Competitor Assay kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad,
CA, USA). Experiments were performed in triplicate and
IC50 values were calculated using GraphPad Prism. Ki values
were calculated using a previously described web-server tool
to calculate Ki values from IC50 values given the total receptor
and ligand concentrations and the KD of the target-ligand
reaction (Cer et al., 2009). To investigate PPARγ transcrip-
tional activity, HEK-293T cells were seeded in 24-well plates
and transiently co-transfected with the expression vector
GAL4-PPARγ and the luciferase reporter vectors GAL4-luc
(firefly luciferase) and pRL-CMV (Renilla luciferase) using
Roti©-Fect (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. After stimulation, the luciferase
activities were quantified using the Dual-Luciferase Assay
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA).
W
estern blots
Cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells per well in 60 mm plates and,
after 24 h, treated with the indicated concentrations of the
compounds for 6 h. Then, cells were washed with PBS, and
proteins extracted in 50 μL of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl
pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol and 1% NP-40) supple-
mented with 10 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 10 μg·mL�1
leupeptin, 1 μg·mL�1 pepstatin and aprotinin and 1 μL·mL�1
saturated PMSF. Protein concentration was determined by
the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), and samples
(30 μg protein) were boiled at 95°C in Laemmli buffer and
analysed by electrophoresis in 10% SDS/PAGE gels. Separated
proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (20 V for
30 min), and after blocking with non-fat milk or BSA in
TBST buffer, primary antibodies were added. The washed mem-
branes were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies
coupled to HRP that were detected by an enhanced chemilumi-
nescence system (USB Corporation, Cleveland, OH, USA). Rab-
bit antibody against PPARγ (C26H12) and mouse anti-β-actin
antibody (AC-74) were obtained from Cell Signalling Technol-
ogy (Beverly, MA, USA) and Sigma-Aldrich respectively.
Determination of mitochondrial biogenesis
N2a cells were seeded in 96-well plates (3.5 × 103 cells per
well), and after 24 h, stimulated in quadruplicate wells with
Δ9-THC or Δ9-THCA at the indicated concentrations for
72 h. Rosiglitazone (10 μM) was used as positive control.
Then, Mitotracker Green (100 nM; Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA, USA) was added to culture medium for
30 min. Cells were washed with PBS, and fresh culture me-
dium was added. Images were taken, and fluorescence was
measured using the cell imaging system IncuCyte HD (Essen
BioScience, Inc., Hertfordshire, UK).
Striatal neuroprotection in vitro
STHdhQ7/Q7 and STHdhQ111/Q111 cells (104 cells per well) were
seeded in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS in 96-well
plates, and after 24 h, the culture medium was changed to
DMEM containing 0.5% FBS for 4 h (serum deprived). Then,
Δ9-THC or Δ9-THCA was added to culture medium in the
absence or the presence of 5 μM GW9662, a PPARγ antago-
nist for 48 h. Cell viability was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-
2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) as-
say. Briefly, 50 μL of 3-MTT (5 mg·mL�1) from a mixture solu-
tion of MTT : DMEM (1:2) per well was added for 4 h at 33°C
in darkness. Supernatants were removed, and 100 μL DMSO
was added to each well. Absorbance was measured at 550 nm
using a TriStar LB 941.
Animals
All animal care and experimental procedures were performed
in accordance with European Union guideline and approved
by the Animal Research Ethic Committee of Córdoba Univer-
sity and the Andalusian Committee for Animal Experimenta-
tion (2014PI/017). Animal studies are reported in compliance
with the ARRIVE guidelines (Kilkenny et al., 2010; McGrath
and Lilley, 2015). A total of 70 adult (16 weeks old),
C57BL/6 male mice weighing between 23 and 25 g (Envigo,
Valencia, Spain) were used in the studies. Mice were housed
in the Animal Facilities of Córdoba University in groups of
5–6 in polycarbonate cages (300 × 180 × 150 mm) with access
to food and water ad libitum. A 12 h light/dark cycle was
maintained, with controlled temperature (20 ± 2°C) and
relative humidity (40–50%).
Mouse model of striatal neurodegeneration
Systemic administration of 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NPA),
an inhibitor of the mitochondrial complex II, results in a
progressive locomotor
deterioration and
striatal
degen-
eration resembling HD in several different mice strains
(Borlongan et al., 1997). In our work, we had five experimen-
tal groups- control (PBS+vehicle); 3NPA (3NPA+vehicle);
3NPA+THCA; 3NPA+THCA+T0070907; THCA (PBS+THCA).
Each group had 9 animals and there were no experimental
losses. All treatments were given by i.p.injection of 100μL
each. Striatal neurodegeneration was induced in C57BL/6
mice, by seven i.p. injections of 3-NPA (50 mg·kg�1)
every 12 h, over 4 days. Control mice received seven PBS
injections. Vehicle (1:1:18 ethanol : Cremophor : saline) or
Δ9-THCA (20 mg·kg�1) was injected 30min before the PBS
or 3NPA every 24h, over 4 days. The PPARγ antagonist
T0070907 (5 mg·kg�1).was injected 15min before THCA,
every 24h, over 4 days. Twelve hours after the last adminis-
tration of 3-NPA, behavioural analyses were carried out by
measuring hindlimb clasping, hindlimb dystonia, truncal
dystonia
and general locomotor activity, as
previously
described (Fernagut et al., 2002). Each mice was given a score
0, 1 or 2 for each test, where 0 corresponds to normal behav-
iour and 2 with the maximum motor disorder. The analysis
of symptomatology was carried out in a blinded manner by
two independent observers. Animals were killed by cervical
dislocation, and brains were removed. The right hemi-
spheres were used to dissect the striatum to study mRNA
expression for Tnf-α, Inos, Il-6 and Cox-2. The other hemi-
sphere was fixed in 4% formaldehyde for histological
analysis.

 Gene expression
N2a cells (105 cells per mL) were stimulated with Δ9-THC,
Δ9-THCA or rosiglitazone for 72 h, and total RNA was
extracted using the High Pure RNA Isolation Kit (Roche Diag-
nostic, Indianapolis, IN, USA). RNA was extracted from the
striatum using the Qiagen RNeasy Lipid Kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany). Total RNA (1 μg) was retrotranscribed using the
iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit, and the cDNA analysed by real-
time PCR using the iQTM SYBR Green Supermix and a
CFX96 Real-time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). The HPRT
gene was used to standardize mRNA expression in each sam-
ple. Gene expression was quantified using the 2�ΔΔCt method,
and the percentage of relative expression against controls
(untreated cells or mice) was calculated. The primers used in
this study are described in Supporting Information Table S1.
Histological analysis
Brains were embedded in paraffin, and sections (5μm) cut and
used for Nissl staining. Immunohistochemical analysis was
performed to study activated microglia (Iba-1+) or astrocytes
[glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)+], as described previ-
ously (Valdeolivas et al., 2015). A Leica DM2500 microscope
and a LeicaDFC420c camera were used for slide observation
and photography, and all image processing was done using
ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).
Multiple sections, selected from levels located approximately
200 μm from the middle of the lesion, were obtained from
each brain and used to generate a mean value per mouse. All
histological data were obtained in a blinded manner by two
independent observers.
Data and statistical analysis
The data and statistical analysis comply with the recommen-
dations on experimental design and analysis in pharmacol-
ogy (Curtis et al., 2015). The in vitro data are shown as
mean ± SD and in vivo results as mean ± SEM. Statistical
analysis was performed in all the experiments shown using
the SPSS v.19 software for Windows (IBM Corporation, NY,
USA). Statistical analysis for multiple groups was performed
by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test when
F achieved P < 0.05, and there was no significant variance
in homogeneity. Some results were normalized to control
to avoid unwanted sources of variation. Such data were
subjected to Kruskal–Wallis non-parametric test followed by
Dunn’s post hoc test using the GraphPad Prism v.5 for
Windows (GraphPad Software Inc, La Jolla, CA, USA). Statisti-
cal significance was set at P < 0.05.
Materials
Rosiglitazone was obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann
Arbor, MI, USA), and all other reagents were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).

Cannabinoid acids bind and activate PP
ARγ
The main phytocannabinoid acids present in fresh Cannabis
sativa L. plant material include Δ9-THCA, CBDA and CBGA,
which after decarboxylation generate their active neutral
forms, Δ9-THC, CBD and CBG, that are mainly found in
processed plant material. As PPARγ is a potential target for
some natural and synthetic cannabinoids, we first wanted
to investigate whether neutral and acid cannabinoids were
able to bind to PPARγ and compare their binding capacity
with that of rosiglitazone. Using a PPARγ competitor-binding
assay, the cannabinoid acids outperformed the neutral canna-
binoids in binding to the nuclear receptor. Δ9-THCA was the
most potent cannabinoid with an IC50 of 0.47 μM, in the
same range as that of rosiglitazone (0.29 μM) (Figure 1). To
further study the ability of these cannabinoids to activate
PPARγ transcriptional activity, 293T cells were transfected
with a pair of GAL4-PPARγ/GAL4-luc plasmids and stimu-
lated with increasing concentrations of the compounds for
6 h. In this assay, Δ9-THCA was more potent than Δ9-THC
(Figure 2A), and CBDA was more effective than CBD, but only
at the higher concentrations (Figure 2B). In contrast, CBGA
and CBG showed equal potency in activating PPARγ, indicat-
ing that there is not always a direct correlation between
binding affinity and transcriptional activity (Figure 2C).
Interestingly, a phytoextract of MONIEK, a Cannabis variety
containing
high
concentrations
of
Δ9-THCA,
activated
PPARγ in a concentration-dependent manner, and this ac-
tivity was greatly reduced after decarboxylation of the
extract (Figure 2D).
PPARγ is known to suffer ligand-induced degradation in
the proteasome (Hauser et al., 2000; Kim et al., 2014). As
shown in Figure 2E, Δ9-THCA and rosiglitazone, but not Δ9-
THC, induced PPARγ degradation in STHdh striatal cells, and
a similar effect was found with CBGA and CBDA (Supporting
Information Figure S1), demonstrating that the cannabinoid
acids also target endogenous PPARγ. We also confirmed that
Δ9-THCA induced PPARγ transcriptional activity in STHdh
striatal cells (Figure 2F). Δ9-THCA and rosiglitazone also
induced PPARγ degradation in HEK293T cells showing that
the effect of Δ9-THCA on PPARγ is not cell-type dependent
(Supporting Information Figure S2).
To further analyse the effects of Δ9-THCA at this nuclear
receptor, we studied the behaviour of this compound in the
presence of rosiglitazone, a full agonist of PPARγ (Lehmann
et
al.,
1995).
To
achieve
this,
GAL4-PPARγ/GAL4-luc-
transfected HEK293 cells were pre-incubated with increasing
concentrations of Δ9-THCA and then treated with 1 μM
rosiglitazone. Under these conditions, Δ9-THCA decreased
the rosiglitazone-induced PPARγ transactivation (Figure 3A),
suggesting that Δ9-THCA and rosiglitazone may bind to
the same binding site on PPARγ. Next, to investigate the
binding characteristics of Δ9-THCA to PPARγ, the induction
of PPARγ activity was studied in washout experiments
where Δ9-THCA was removed from the cell culture solution
by washing the cells with PBS after 1 h of treatment and
PPARγ activity was measured after 5 h cell culture in the
absence of the compound. The results showed that activa-
tion of PPARγ by Δ9-THCA was greatly reduced 5 h after
removal of Δ9-THCA from the cell medium, suggesting that

 binding of Δ9-THCA binds to PPARγ in a reversible manner
(Figure 3B).
Effects of Δ9-THCA on mitochondrial
biogenesis and PGC-1α expression
Ligands for PPARγ, such as rosiglitazone, increase mitochon-
drial biogenesis in neuronal cells (Chiang et al., 2015). There-
fore, we carried out experiments to determine if Δ9-THCA and
Δ9-THC could increase mitochondrial biogenesis. For these
studies, N2a cells were incubated with either Δ9-THCA,
Δ9-THC or rosiglitazone at the indicated concentrations for
72 h and then loaded with Mitotracker Green, which is a
probe used to determine mitochondrial mass. The fluorescent
intensity changes were recorded and analysed using the
IncuCyte® ZOOM Software. Δ9-THCA treatment induced a
significant increase in mitochondrial mass levels, comparable
with that induced by rosiglitazone (Figure 4A, B). In addition,
Δ9-THCA and rosiglitazone, but not Δ9-THC, were able to up-
regulate the expression of PGC-1α, a PPARγ-interacting
protein and potential HD target that plays a key role in
mitochondrial biogenesis (Johri et al., 2013). Interestingly,
Δ9-THCA was more potent than rosiglitazone in inducing
PGC-1α expression (Figure 4C).
Δ9-THCA attenuates mHtt-induced
cytotoxicity in vitro
The mHtt protein bearing 111 glutamines in the N-terminal
domain (Q111/Q111) induces cytotoxicity depending on the
cell type and culture conditions. In Figure 5A, we show that
Q111/Q111
induced
cytotoxicity
under
serum-deprived
conditions while Q7/Q7 cells were resistant to serum depri-
vation. Therefore, we analysed the effects of Δ9-THCA and
Δ9-THC in STHdhQ111/Q111. We found that neuronal viability
after serum deprivation was improved by Δ9-THCA in
STHdhQ111/Q111 cells, and this activity was attenuated in the
presence of the PPARγ antagonist GW9662 (Figure 5B). To
confirm these results in another cell model, we infected N2a
cells with an adenovirus carrying human huntingtin contain-
ing 94 polyQ repeats (mHtt-q94). We found that cytotoxicity
induced by mHtt-q94 was also significantly attenuated
by
treatment
with
Δ9-THCA
or
Δ9-THC
(Supporting
Information Figure S4).
Treatment with Δ9-THCA protects against
striatal neurodegeneration in mice
Systemic administration of 3-NPA, an irreversible inhibitor of
respiratory chain complex II, leads to downstream processes
of striatal neurodegeneration that mimic some clinical and
pathological
effects
observed
in
the
human
disease
(Borlongan et al., 1997). Administration of 3-NPA results in
motor deficits assessed as higher score in hindlimb clasping,
hindlimb dystonia, locomotor activity and kyphosis tests
compared with control mice. However, treatment with
Δ9-THCA during the development of the neurodegeneration
with 3-NPA, resulted in significant improvement of behav-
ioural symptomatology including hindlimb dystonia, loco-
motor
activity
and
kyphosis
evaluation
and
a
slight
amelioration in the hindlimb clasping test (Figure 6A). In
contrast, when mice were treated with a combination of
Δ9-THCA and the PPARγ antagonist T0070907, the benefi-
cial effects of Δ9-THCA were significantly inhibited. No
differences
in behavioural
activity
were
observed
after
Δ9-THCA treatment of control mice, receiving PBS instead
of 3-NPA.
In
addition,
3-NPA-lesioned
mice
showed
an
up-
regulation of the proinflammatory markers Tnf-α, Inos and
Il-6 mRNAs in the striatum that was prevented by treatment
with Δ9-THCA. The effect of Δ9-THCA on Tnf-α and Inos
mRNA
expression
was
abolished
in
the
presence
of
T0070907, but the PPARγ antagonist did not reverse the in-
hibitory effect of Δ9-THCA on Il-6 mRNA expression. On the

at the indicated concentrations and compared with the binding af-
finity of rosiglitazone (RGZ). Data were transformed to a logarithmic
function, and the Ki values were calculated and are shown in the
Figure (n = 5).

 other hand, Cox-2 was not strongly induced by 3-NPA, but
nevertheless, this increased expression was also prevented
by Δ9-THCA (Figure 6B).
Finally, we investigated the effect of Δ9-THCA in neuro-
nal loss and gliosis induced by 3-NPA. Histological examina-
tion by Nissl staining revealed that treatment with Δ9-THCA
significantly prevented striatal degeneration induced by
3-NPA (Figure 7). GFAP immunostaining identifies reactive
gliosis, an early marker of CNS damage in HD (Hedreen
and Folstein, 1995), and we found that 3-NPA induced a
marked astrogliosis determined by GFAP staining and a less
severe microgliosis revealed by Iba-1 staining, which were
prevented by Δ9-THCA treatment (Figure 7B). Altogether,
our
results
demonstrated
that
Δ9-THCA
reduced
the
neuroinflammatory status induced by with the injections
of 3-NPA.

 Discussion
Over the past years, interest for the medical use of mari-
juana has grown exponentially, partly fuelled, however, by
anecdotal information. To investigate the real potential of
medicinal marijuana, preclinical and clinical studies have
been launched, with positive results for some neurological
conditions like multiple sclerosis and some genetic juvenile
forms of epilepsy. All these studies have used the neutral
cannabinoids, especially Δ9-THC and CBD, with little atten-
tion
to
the
genuine
phytocannabinoids
of
the
plant,
namely, their acidic forms. We provide evidence that these
compounds
hold
significant
pharmacological
potential,
with Δ9-THCA being a potent PPARγ agonist and showing
neuroprotective and neuroinflammatory activity in an ani-
mal model of HD. Interestingly, other cannabinoid acids
(CBDA and CBGA) also outperformed their corresponding
neutral cannabinoids in terms of PPARγ binding, and a
non-decarboxylated botanical preparation of Cannabis also
showed more potent PPARγ transcriptional activity than its
decarboxylated version.
Administration of Δ9-THCA and activation of cannabi-
noid CB1 receptors have already been shown to exert a neuro-
protective
action
in
different
models
of
CNS
diseases
including HD (Blazquez et al., 2011; Fernández-Ruiz et al.,
2015; Basavargiappa et al., 2017). However, in other trans-
genic models of HD, treatment with CB1 receptor ligands,
including Δ9-THC, did not improve the progression of the
pathology (Dowie et al., 2010). Moreover, a botanical prepara-
tion containing Δ9-THC/CBD (1:1 ratio) failed to improve
symptomatology in a recent Phase II clinical trial with HD pa-
tients (López-Sendon Moreno et al., 2016). HD progression
occurs concomitantly with an early decline of presynaptic
CB1 receptors (McCaw et al., 2004), and therefore, targeting
CB1 receptors may be a plausible therapeutic strategy in the
initial stages of HD, to be later replaced by anti-inflammatory
drugs. In this regard, drugs targeting PPARγ, the nuclear
receptor for some cannabinoids, have been shown to be
beneficial by attenuating microglia inflammation and by
modulating the peripheral adaptive immune response (Kim
et al., 2015). In addition, preclinical evidence suggests that
PPARγ ligands many exert beneficial effects in many CNS
diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson’s
disease, Alzheimer’s disease, HD, multiple sclerosis and stroke
(Katsouri et al., 2012).
One important dysregulated gene in HD is that for PGC-
1α, a transcriptional co-activator protein involved in energy
homeostasis and adaptive thermogenesis. PGC-1α mRNA
levels are decreased in autopsy samples of human HD stria-
tum, and striatal cell death in HD may be due to the altered
energy metabolism and excitotoxicity induced by the aggre-
gation of expanded Htt (Browne and Beal, 2004). Here, we
have shown that Δ9-THCA up-regulated PGC-1α mRNA
expression and prevented mHtt-induced cell death in two dif-
ferent cellular models. Thus, the protective effect of Δ9-THCA
could be mediated by restoring the energy metabolism in the
target cells and by down-regulating the expression of proin-
flammatory mediators that are commonly associated with
HD (Rocha et al., 2016).
Δ9-THCA is a non-psychotropic cannabinoid, but its
binding to CB1 receptors is still debated. While some au-
thors showed that Δ9-THCA binds CB1 receptors with a Ki
value of 23.5 nM (Rosenthaler et al., 2014), others had
found a negligible activity (Ahmed et al., 2008). A possible
explanation for these contrasting results could be the
occurrence
of
decarboxylation
during
storage
of
the
compound or under some experimental conditions. A re-
cent study showed that freshly prepared and highly pure
Δ9-THCA (98%) has a low binding affinity for CB1 and
CB2 receptors (McPartland et al., 2017). Thus, it seems
that the biological activities of Δ9-THCA are not mediated
by interaction with these classical membrane receptors. In
this context , Δ9-THCA exhibited anti-emetic and immuno-
modulatory activities through CB1-dependent and CB1-in-
dependent
mechanisms
respectively
(Verhoeckx
et
al.,
2006; Rock et al., 2013). The sample of Δ9-THCA used in
this study was 97% pure (Supporting Information Figure S4),
and as its PPARγ binding and transcriptional activities were
20-fold higher than those of Δ9-THC, we suggest that
PPARγ
assays
could
be
used
to
monitor
Δ9-THCA

 decarboxylation during storage, as an alternative to the
chemical analysis.
We also showed that T0070907 prevented the neuropro-
tective effect of Δ9-THCA in 3-NPA-lesioned mice. We
suggest that Δ9-THCA enters the CNS and that PPARγ is
the major target responsible for the neuroprotective and
anti-inflammatory activity for this cannabinoid. Δ9-THCA
also showed neuroprotective activities in vitro (Moldzio
et al., 2012), and there is anecdotal evidence that tinctures
of
Δ9-THCA
may
have
anti-seizure
activity
(https://
tokesignals.com/parents-thca-tincture-works-just-as-well-as-
cbd-for-pediatric-seizures-heres-how-to-make-it/). PPARγ sig-
nalling has a role in neuroinflammation and epilepsy, and it
is
possible
that
the
potential
anti-seizure
activities
of
Δ9-THCA and tinctures containing this cannabinoid, could
be mediated by the modulation of this nuclear receptor
(Chuang et al., 2012; Wong et al., 2015). Interestingly,
non-decarboxylated botanical preparations of medicinal
marijuana
may
contain
also
high
levels
of
other
non-psychotropic cannabinoid acids such as CBDA and
CBGA that also target PPARγ.
The effect of cannabinoid acids on PPARγ is not without
precedent. Δ9-THC is metabolized in the body to produce
the major, non-psychotropic metabolite, THC-11-oic acid.
Interestingly, ajulemic acid, a synthetic analogue of THC-11-
oic acid, is a potent PPARγ agonist, suggesting that a COOH
group is critical for the activation of the PPARγ pathway
(Ambrosio et al., 2007). Furthermore, the formation of THC-
11-oic acid after Δ9-THC treatment could underlie the in vivo
biological effects of Δ9-THC mediated by the PPARγ pathway
(Vara et al., 2013; Fishbein-Kaminietsky et al., 2014).
PPARγ ligands include a wide array of natural and
synthetic molecules among which the best characterized are
the glitazones, a group of thiazolidinediones that have been
extensively used in patients with Type 2 diabetes. The
glitazones bind to the canonical ligand-binding pocket
(LPB) located within the nuclear receptor ligand-binding
domain of PPARγ and act as full agonists (Hughes et al.,

 2012). However, PPARγ ligands of this type have undesirable
side effects like weight gain, oedema, liver injury, cancer and
an increased risk of heart failure (Rosen, 2010). Furthermore,
reduced bone mass and increased risk of peripheral fractures
in thiazolidinedione-treated patients are the results of inhibi-
tion of bone marrow osteoblastogenesis (Grey et al., 2007).
Therefore, considerable research efforts have recently been
modulators (SPPARMs), compounds that improve glucose
homeostasis but elicit reduced side effects, because they
are
partial
agonists
at
PPARγ,
as
shown
by
selective
receptor–cofactor interactions and target gene regulation.
Plant-derived
compounds
represent
a
good
source
of
SPPARMs that bind to the canonical ligand-binding site
and act as partial agonists, and Δ9-THCA is another com-
pound to add to this list of natural compounds (Wang
et al., 2014). We have shown that Δ9-THCA binds to puri-
fied PPARγ (Ki = 209 nM), activates chimeric Gal4-PPARγ-
dependent reporter gene expression as a partial agonist
(with a maximal efficacy sixfold lower than rosiglitazone)
and
antagonizes
the
effect
of
rosiglitazone
upon
co-
treatment. Moreover, some of the activities of Δ9-THCA
are blocked by GW9662 and T0070907, which are syn-
thetic
irreversible
PPARγ
antagonists
that
covalently
attach to Cys285 located within the LBP of PPARγ. Alto-
gether, these data suggest that Δ9-THCA binds to the
canonical LPB in a reversible manner. However, a second
functional binding site in the PPARγ LBP has been identi-
fied, and functional PPARγ agonists targeting this second
site are not affected by GW9662, and it has been suggested
that
ligands
targeting
different
binding
sites
mediate
distinct biological responses (Hughes et al., 2014). We
found that T0070907 did not prevent the effect of Δ9-
THCA on Il-6 mRNA expression in vivo, and so, it is
possible that Δ9-THCA may also bind to alternative binding
sites. In addition, Δ9-THCA outperforms rosiglitazone in
inducing PPARγ degradation, a mechanism that involves
ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome and
serves to limit the PPARγ response to specific ligands
(Hauser et al., 2000; Kim et al., 2014). Although the exact
mechanism of action of Δ9-THCA on the PPARγ pathway
remains
to
be
fully
elucidated,
this
compound
may
qualify as a potentially safe SPPARM.
The limited shelf life of Δ9-THCA will undoubtedly
complicate its development, but the compound enjoys a
remarkable stability in human fluids, even serving as a
marker to distinguish the recreational use of marijuana

 from the medical use of the semi-synthetic version of
Δ9-THC (Marinol) (Raikos et al., 2014). Such degradation
of Δ9-THCA might be prevented by binding to plasma
proteins
like
albumin,
and
this
could
provide
a
clue
in
the
development
of
stable
formulations,
as
done,
incidentally, also for of Δ9-THC itself, a highly unstable
compound in the pure state. Alternatively, Δ9-THCA may
serve as a scaffold to develop more stable analogues that
retain its PPARγ agonist activity but are devoid of narcotic
properties.
Taken together, the results of our study show that canna-
binoid acids are more potent PPARγ agonists and transcrip-
tional activators than their decarboxylated analogues. These
data would strongly suggest Δ9-THCA as a lead structure for
the development of novel drugs for the management of HD
and, possibly, other neurodegenerative and inflammatory
diseases.

Figure S1 Cannabinoid acids induce higher PPARγ degrada-
tion compared to their decarboxylated forms. STHdhQ7/Q7
cells were treated with Δ9-THCA-A, CBG, CBGA, CBD or
CBDA for 6 hours and the steady state levels of endogenous
PPARγ and β-actin detected by Western blots.
Figure S2 HEK-293T cells were seeded at 1 x 104 in 60 mm
dishes and 24 h later treated with RGZ or Δ9-THCA for 6 hours
and the steady state levels of endogenous PPARγ and β-actin
detected by Western blot.

toxicity. A) N2a cells were seeded at 3.5 x103 in poly-d-ly-
sine treated 96-well plates. After 24 hours, cells were
infected for 5 h with 1 μl/ml of adenovirus expressing
CFP-tagged human huntingtin exon 1 harboring a patho-
genic polyQ tract of 94 CAG repeats. Then, medium was
replaced by fresh medium and the cells treated with
Δ9-THCA or Δ9-THC at the indicated doses and images were
taken after 72 hours. A) Cell viability was determined using
the IncuCyte HD software and non-infected cells were con-
sidered as 100 % of cell viability. B) DAPI stained nuclei
and expressions of CFP-tagged mHttq94 protein were ana-
lyzed by confocal microscopy.
Figure S4 Isolated Δ9-THCA analyzed by GC-MS. Δ9-THCA
was diluted in 3 mL of hexane. An intermediate solution
was prepared and 50 μL were taken and mixed with 20
uL of IS (CBD-d3) and dried together in a concentrator.
The dry residue was reconstituted in 15 μL of pyridine
and 135 μL of derivative mixture BSTFA: TMCS (98:2 v/v)
and incubated at 37 C for 1 hour. Crimp vials were used
in order to avoid leakage. Δ9-THCA purity was 97%.
