Summary
Background Despite effective pharmacotherapy, asthma continues to impair quality of life for most patients. Non-
pharmacological approaches, including breathing retraining, are therefore of great interest to patients. However, 
clinicians rarely advocate breathing retraining and access to this intervention is restricted for most patients due to the 
limited availability of suitable physiotherapists and poor integration of breathing retraining into standard care. We 
aimed to assess the effectiveness of a digital self-guided breathing retraining intervention.
Methods In this randomised controlled trial, we recruited patients from 34 general practices in the UK. Eligibility 
criteria for patients with asthma were broad, comprising a physician diagnosis of asthma, age of 16–70 years, receipt 
of at least one anti-asthma medication in the previous year, and impaired asthma-related quality of life (Asthma 
Quality of Life Questionnaire [AQLQ] score of <5·5). We developed a self-guided intervention, which was delivered as 
a DVD plus a printed booklet (DVDB). Participants were randomly assigned to receive either the DVDB intervention, 
three face-to-face breathing retraining sessions, or standard care, in a 2:1:2 ratio, for 12 months. Randomisation was 
achieved using the Southampton Clinical Trials Unit telephone randomisation service by use of random number 
generators. The primary outcome was the AQLQ score in the intention-to-treat population at 12 months. The trial was 
powered to show equivalence between the two active intervention groups, and superiority of both intervention groups 
over usual care. Secondary outcomes included patient-reported and physiological measures of asthma control, patient 
acceptability, and health-care costs. This trial was registered with International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial 
Number registry, number ISRCTN88318003.
Findings Between Nov 5, 2012 and Jan 28, 2014, invitations to participate in the study were sent to 15 203 patients  with 
general practitioner-diagnosed asthma, of whom 655 were recruited into the study. AQLQ scores at 12 months were 
significantly higher in the DVDB group (mean 5·40, SD 1·14) than in the usual care group (5·12, SD 1·17; adjusted 
mean difference 0·28, 95% CI 0·11 to 0·44), and in the face-to-face group (5·33, SD 1·06) than in the usual care 
group (adjusted mean difference 0·24, 95% CI 0·04 to 0·44); AQLQ scores were similar between the DVDB group 
and the face-to-face group (0·04, 95% CI –0·16 to 0·24). There were no significant differences between the 
randomisation groups in FEV1 or fraction of exhaled nitric oxide. 744 adverse events occurred in 272 patients: 
101 (39%) of 261 patients in the DVDB group, 55 (42%) of 132 patients in the face-to-face group, and 132 (50%) of 
262 in the usual care group, with patients reporting one or more event. 11 (4%) patients in the DVDB group, four (3%) 
patients in the face-to-face group, and 20 (8%) patients in the usual care group had a serious adverse event.
Interpretation Breathing retraining programmes improve quality of life in patients with incompletely controlled asthma 
despite having little effect on lung function or airway inflammation. Such programmes can be delivered conveniently 
and cost-effectively as a self-guided digital audiovisual programme, so might also reduce health-care costs.

Introduction
Asthma is a serious and common global health problem, 
affecting up to 18% of the world population.1 Although 
pharmacotherapy can provide full symptom control for 
some individuals,2 real-life surveys repeatedly show that 
all outcomes remain suboptimal for many patients, with 
most having persisting symptoms and quality of life 
impair 
ment.3 Many patients have concerns about taking 
regular medication, particularly corticosteroids, and 
express an interest in non-pharmacological self-
management strategies, with up to 30% reporting that 
they use breathing techniques to help control their 
symptoms.4 Preliminary randomised trials have reported 
beneficial outcomes from breathing retraining in asthma, 
particularly from physiotherapy-based programmes.5,6 
Such programmes are, therefore, now advocated in 
asthma guidelines1,7 as an adjuvant for patients whose 
symptoms 
remain 
uncontrolled 
despite 
standard 
pharmacological treatment. However, in National Health 
Service (NHS) practice, these methods are rarely used

because of insufficient access to suitably trained physio 
 
therapists. There is clear evidence for the effectiveness of 
self-management education in asthma management, 
although 
current 
programmes 
focus 
mainly 
on 
pharmacological strategies and do not include breathing 
retraining. Self-guided digital programmes have the 
potential to be accessed easily, conveniently, and 
inexpensively by large numbers of people with asthma 
and to deliver standardised interventions.8
We hypothesised that breathing retraining delivered as 
a digital, audiovisual, self-guided programme to patients 
with mild and moderate asthma, but with persisting 
symptoms, would improve asthma-related quality of 
life above usual care, be equivalent to face-to-face 
physiotherapist instruction, be cost-effective, and be an 
acceptable intervention for patients.
Methods
Study design and participants
This was a pragmatic 3-group, 12-month, observer-
blinded, parallel-group randomised trial comparing the 
use of a DVD and booklet (DVDB) intervention with 
face-to-face physiotherapy or with a control group 
receiving usual care, in adults with asthma who were 
recruited from 34 UK general practices. Ethical approval 
for the study was provided by the NHS Health Research 
Authority 
South-Central—Hampshire 
B 
Research 
Ethics committee (12/SC/0353). A protocol has been 
published.9
As a pragmatic, randomised trial,10 participants had 
baseline characteristics measured, but broad entry criteria 
(with inclusion of smokers and no requirement for 
reversibility of airflow obstruction) and a minimally 
disruptive study procedure were used. To be included in 
the study, participants had to be aged 16–70 years, be 
registered at a medical practice for at least 12 months, have 
asthma diagnosed by a physician, have been prescribed at 
least 1 asthma medication in the previous year, achieve an 
Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ)11 score of 
less than 5·5, and to provide written informed consent. 
Patients were excluded if they had concomitant chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) diagnosis with 
FEV1 less than 60% predicted.
Randomisation and masking
Patients were randomly assigned (2:1:2) to receive the 
DVDB intervention, face-to-face physiotherapy, or usual 
care. This randomisation schedule was used because the 
face-to-face group was the most financially and logistically 
challenging to deliver to patients. Randomisation was 
done after eligibility assessment and informed consent; 
the research nurse telephoned the randomisation service 
provided by Southampton Clinical Trials Unit, where staff 
trained in registration and randomisation procedures

Research in context
Evidence before this study
Asthma is a complex, heterogeneous condition that affects 
patients in many ways; physically, psychologically, as well as 
affecting quality of life. Pharmacological treatments are effective, 
yet most patients continue to have ongoing symptoms and 
quality of life impairment despite the use of drug treatment. 
Many patients are interested in non-pharmacological treatment 
approaches, but the evidence base for most non-pharmacological 
interventions is inconclusive, with existing studies often 
underpowered or methodologically flawed. However, breathing 
retraining exercises have promising supportive evidence and are 
advocated as an add-on option in several evidence-based asthma 
guidelines. We identified two extensive recent systematic reviews 
of breathing retraining in asthma, which have differed in their 
conclusions; we  therefore did not complete a systematic 
literature search ourselves. The 2012 US Agency for Healthcare 
Research and Quality analysis study concluded that 
non-pharmacological techniques can improve asthma symptoms 
and reduce the need for reliever medication, and the 2013 
Cochrane review reported that trends for improvement were 
encouraging, and advocated further studies. Current National 
Health Service breathing retraining programmes involve 
face-to-face attendance with a suitably trained physiotherapist, 
but access is limited because of the scarcity of therapists and the 
logistical and financial challenges of making treatment available 
in routine care.
Added value of this study
We report the largest trial of breathing retraining in asthma to 
date, which used a pragmatic randomised controlled trial design. 
The main finding of this study is that asthma-related quality of 
life impairment is improved by a self-guided programme of 
physiotherapy-based breathing training delivered by a DVD and 
booklet, as an alternative model of delivery to the routine 
face-to-face method, with a magnitude of effect similar to that 
produced by increasing asthma medication. Patients perceived 
benefit from the self-guided programme despite little 
improvement in airway physiology or inflammation. We confirm 
reports from previous smaller studies that improvements in 
quality of life were seen with face-to-face physiotherapist-taught 
programmes compared with usual care. Additionally, we also 
showed that the DVD and booklet programme resulted in 
equivalent clinically relevant benefits more conveniently and 
inexpensively. In keeping with current evidence and 
meta-analysis, no adverse effects of either intervention were 
found.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our findings imply that the self-help intervention can be offered 
conveniently and cost-effectively as an adjuvant 
non-pharmacological treatment to many patients with asthma 
in routine care who have persisting impairment in quality of life 
despite standard pharmacological management.

accessed the web based Tenalea randomisation system. 
The research nurse then provided the participant with the 
appropriate materials and follow-up arrangements for the 
relevant study group. The research nurses who completed 
the exit assessments and medical record review were 
different from those completing the baseline assessment, 
and had no information about group allocations, with 
patients requested not to disclose their own treatment 
group. All analyses were completed by researchers 
masked to treatment allocation and without access to 
unmasked data.
Procedures
We developed an evidence-based, self-guided intervention 
delivered via a DVD plus a printed supporting booklet, 
which was based on an existing breathing retraining pro-
gramme taught by physiotherapists and shown to be effec-
tive in poorly controlled asthma.5,6 The DVDB materials 
were developed by a multidisciplinary team including 
physicians, 
physiotherapists, 
health 
psycho 
logists, 
com 
 
 
 
munications technology specialists, and patient repre-
sentatives, with extensive iterative qualitative patient input 
to optimise acceptability and effectiveness, and consisted of 
three elements. First, the DVDB inter 
vention provided a de-
tailed explanation and illus 
tration of how to complete the 
breathing exercises, with footage showing a physiotherapist 
teaching these exercises to patients. The exercises com-
prised an illustration of, and training in, diaphragmatic 
breathing, nasal breathing, slow breathing, controlled 
breath holds, and simple relaxation exercises. Second, the 
DVDB intervention provided motivational components, ex-
plaining the rationale and addressing common concerns. 
Finally, supportive features (such as a daily planner and 
progress charts) were included for practicing and imple-
menting the techniques in daily life.
The materials were piloted and finalised with 
29 members of the target population, purposively sampled 
for diversity of age, gender, education, and symptom 
profile, by use of the person-based think aloud methods12 to 
elicit reactions and modify the materials based on the 
feedback received.13 The content of the DVD and the 
supporting booklet have been transferred to an internet-
based version, and is freely available through the Breathe 
Study website.
Potentially eligible patients, identified by computer 
searches of routine clinical records from general practices, 
received the study information and the AQLQ by mail. 
Questionnaires were repeated via post at 3 and 6 months, 
with a final assessment visit at 12 months done by a study 
nurse blinded to randomisation group, at which all 
baseline measures were repeated. If participants were 
unable to attend the final visit, questionnaire data were 
obtained by post or telephone.
Participants randomly assigned to the usual care group 
received usual medical care, with no additional attention to 
the baseline assessment. Participants randomly assigned 
to the DVDB intervention group were provided with the 
DVD and the booklet. Participants randomly assigned to 
the face-to-face group also received the booklet and worked 
to a standardised inter 
vention schedule and were seen by a 
respiratory physio 
therapist who was trained and skilled in 
providing breathing retraining for three one-to-one 
sessions, each of about  40 min duration, approximately 
once every 2 weeks after randomisation. The same 
physiotherapist, working to a structured protocol, delivered 
all the face-to-face sessions for all patients. Fidelity to 
treatment delivery was identified by use of a physiotherapist-
completed checklist at every session, and a direct 
observation checklist completed by one author (AB) of a 
random sample of 5% of sessions. Protocol adherence was 
predefined as conforming to 90% of the checklist, and was 
100% on both the physiotherapist and the observation 
checklists.
A pre-specified health economic assessment was done by 
assessing the intervention provision costs, and mean 
health service use cost per patient by treatment group, 
aggregated from the costs of asthma-related prescriptions, 
consultations, and hospital admissions, and is reported in 
full elsewhere.14
Outcomes
The primary outcome measure was the 12-month AQLQ 
score adjusted for the baseline values of prespecified 
covariates during statistical analysis. Secondary patient 
outcomes were questionnaire measures of asthma control, 
and measurements of airway physiology (FEV1, peak 
expiratory flow rate [PEFR], forced vital capacity [FVC]), 
airway inflammation (fraction of exhaled nitric oxide 
[FENO] measurements with Nioxx Mino [Circassia, Oxford, 
UK]), and asthma-related health resource use, in addition 
to a health-economic assessment (appendix). Validated 
questionnaires used to assess secondary out 
come 
measures were the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ),15 
which measured asthma symptoms; the Nijmegen 
Questionnaire (NQ),16 which measured symptoms related 
to hyperventilation and dysfunctional breathing; and the 
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score (HADS),17 which 
had separate domains to measure anxiety and depression.
Patient experiences and engagement were assessed 
by a study-specific questionnaire and by qualitative 
interviews with participants selected by purposive 
sampling until data saturation was achieved (appendix).
Health resource use and prescriptions were obtained 
from the routine medical records on study exit, with 
asthma attacks, defined as the use of a course of oral 
corticosteroids for worsening respiratory symptoms or 
hospital admission. The economic evaluation report 
followed the CHEERS guideline.14 Adverse events in the 
full intention-to-treat population were reported by the 
local investigators and also gathered from the routine 
medical record at the end of the study by research nurses 
masked to the participants randomisation group. All 
significant (fatal or potentially life-threatening) events 
were collected, and all adverse events resulting in medical

(SD 0·77). Treatments were deemed equivalent if the 
95% CI for the mean difference was included between 
–0·3 and 0·3, with a two-tailed 5% significance level. 
Analysable sample sizes of 117 in the face-to-face group 
and 234 in the usual care and DVDB groups provided 
90% power to detect a difference in mean AQLQ of 0·38 
between active breathing retraining groups and the usual 
care group (as observed in the previous trial6 and of 
similar magnitude to pharmacological interventions in 
asthma),18 and more than 90% power to show equivalence 
between the two active intervention groups. Assuming a 
10% dropout rate, we therefore aimed to recruit 
650 patients.
The primary analysis was a repeated-measures mixed 
model using the 12-month AQLQ score across the 
three groups, with adjustments for prespecified covariates 
comprising baseline AQLQ score, general practitioner 
(GP) practice, age, gender, smoking status, British 
Thoracic Society (BTS) asthma treatment step7 (broadly 
equivalent to GINA step), and HADS and NQ scores. 
Pair-wise comparisons between DVDB and usual care 
groups, face-to-face physiotherapy and usual care groups 
(superiority studies), and DVDB and face-to-face 
physiotherapy groups (equivalence study) were made. 
Prespecified sensitivity analyses were analyses of the 
primary outcome in the per-protocol population (defined 
below) and used a range of recom 
mended methods for 
missing data (appendix). Negative binomial regression 
models were constructed to estimate the incidence rate 
ratios of asthma attacks and rescue bronchodilator 
prescriptions in the intervention groups versus the usual 
care group. No adjustment was made for multiple testing 
since all tests were prespecified with a priori effect sizes.19 
Two statistical packages were used in the analysis, IBM 
SPSS statistics version 24 and STATA version 14. This 
trial was registered with International Standard 
Randomised Controlled Trial Number registry, number 
ISRCTN88318003.

Results
Between Nov 5, 2012, and Jan 28, 2014, patients were 
recruited from 34 GP practices. Invitations were posted 
to 15 203 patients and 1481 responses were received 
(10% response rate). Of those received, 801 (54%) of 
1481 patients were eligible to participate in the study, 
with AQLQ score of more than 5·5 being the commonest 
ineligibility criterion—with 577 participants being 
excluded for this reason. 655 (82%) of 801 eligible patients 
were randomly assigned to treatment: 261 (40%) of 655 to 
the DVDB group, 262 (40%) to the usual care group, and 
132 (20%) to the face-to-face group (figure 1). Baseline 
data (table 1) were similar between groups. The intention-
to-treat population consisted of all participants randomly 
assigned to intervention, and all analyses were repeated 
in the per-protocol population, which included all 
participants with baseline and 12-month primary 
outcome data. There were few missing data for other 
questionnaires (<2%; appendix). Spirometry (FEV1, FVC, 
and FEV1:FVC ratio) was missing in 26 (4%) of 
655 participants randomly assigned to treatment and 
FENO in 49 (8%) of 655, with similar proportions between 
groups (appendix). 21 (3%) of 655 participants withdrew 
from the study (13 [5%] of 261 in the DVDB group, 3 [2%]

usual care group). The AQLQ was returned at 12 months 
by 556 (85%) of 655 participants, but all patients submitted 
a questionnaire at one or more of the follow-up points 
over the course of the study.
The mean AQLQ scores at 12 months were 5·40 
(SD 1·14) in the DVDB group, 5·33 (1·06) in the face-to-
face group, and 5·12 (1·17) in the usual care group. In the 
primary efficacy analysis (table 2, figure 2), the adjusted 
mean AQLQ score in the DVDB group compared with 
the usual care group was 0·28 (95% CI 0·11–0·44), and 
in face-to-face intervention compared with the usual care 
group was 0·24 (0·04–0·44). The adjusted mean 
difference 
between 
the 
DVDB 
and 
face-to-face 
interventions was 0·04 (–0·16 to 0·24). In AQLQ 
subdomains (emotions, symptoms, activities, and en-
vironment), the largest improvements were in the 
emotion subdomain, with the DVDB group (0·38, 
95% CI 0·16–0·60) and the face-to-face group (0·43, 
0·16–0·71) both showing improvements compared with 
the usual care group. In the DVDB group, significant 
improvements over the usual care group were also seen 
in symptoms (0·24, 95% CI 0·05–0·42), activities (0·21, 
0·04–0·41), and environment (0·32, 0·11–0·53) AQLQ 
sub 
domains; a similar improvement in the symptom 
subdomain was also seen in the face-to-face group 
compared with the usual care group (0·27, 0·04–0·49). 
There were no significant differences in overall or 
individual domain scores between the DVDB and face-to-
face groups. Significant differences were maintained in 
the pre-specified sensitivity analyses involving the results 
from the last observation carried forward, with similar 
outcomes shown by use of multiple imputation methods 
for missing data (appendix).
An analysis of individual patient responses was done 
that was recommended to quantify the proportion of 
patients in whom a minimum clinically important 
difference of 0·5 was met, because this analysis can 
provide additional information on the spectrum of the 
response and can be used to calculate numbers needed to 
treat (NNT).20 Clinically important improvements were 
seen in 161 (62%) of 261 patients in the DVDB group, 
85 (64%) of 132 in the face-to-face group, and 146 (56%) of 
262 in the usual care group, with corresponding 
percentages for deterioration of 14 (5%) in the DVDB

group, 5 (4%) in the face-to-face group, and 24 (9%) in the 
usual care group, providing an NNT of eight for DVDB 
versus usual care, and seven for face-to-face versus usual 
care.
We observed no significant differences between groups 
in any secondary outcome measure, other than small 
mag 
nitude but significant improvements in the depres-
sion component of the HADS in the DVDB group 
compared with the usual care group (mean adjusted 
difference –0·56, 95% CI –1·07 to –0·05). In particular, 
there were no significant within-group or between-group 
changes in airway obstruction (FEV1, PEFR), inflam-
mation (FENO), ACQ or NQ scores, or in the anxiety 
component of the HADS (table 2).
Overall, 78 (12%) of 655 participants had one or more 
asthma attack during the 12 month study (table 3); 24 (9%) 
of 261 in the DVDB group, 15 (11%) of 132 in the face-to-
face group, and 39 (15%) of 262 in the usual care group. 
The DVDB group showed a non-significant tendency to 
fewer asthma attacks compared with the usual care group 
(p=0·062; appendix). In a negative binomial regression 
model adjusting for baseline asthma attack frequency and 
prespecified covariates, the incidence of asthma attacks 
for DVDB versus usual care was 0·68 (95% CI 0·39–1·20) 
and for face-to-face versus usual was 0·85 (0·43–1·67). 
A negative binomial regression model adjusted for pre-
specified covariates showed a non-significant lower 
incidence of issued bronchodilator prescriptions in the 
DVDB group versus the usual care group (0·83, 95% CI 
0·68–1·03) and in the face-to-face group versus the usual 
care group (0·81, 0·63–1·04). The incidence of GP 
respiratory-related consultations was similar in the 
DVDB group compared with the usual care group (0·93, 
95% CI 0·74–1·15), in the face-to-face group compared 
with the usual care group (0·94, 0·72–1·24), and was also 
similar in the DVDB group compared with the face-to-
face group (0·97, 0·77–1·22). There were only 
12 respiratory hospital admissions during the 12 month 
study period; four in the DVDB group and eight in the 
usual care group.
The economic assessment is reported in detail else-
where,14 but showed that both interventions were better 
than usual care (ie, they resulted in superior outcomes at 
lower total cost). This finding applied both to AQLQ and 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) comparisons but only 
the improvement in AQLQ was significant. The mean 
annual NHS total medical costs (including costs of 
medication and medical consultations) were numerically 
lower in the DVDB group (£296) than in both the face-to-
face group (£335) and the usual care group (£356), but 
the result was not statistically significant (appendix). The 
cost of each intervention (£83·45 per patient for face-to-
face group and £2·85 for DVDB group) was offset by 
reductions in health service use, but the differences in 
total cost between the intervention groups and usual care 
group were not significant. The probability of dominance 
(improved AQLQ at lower cost than control) was 93% for 
DVDB and 82% for face-to-face interventions. The 
corresponding figures for improved QALY at lower cost 
than usual care was 82% for the DVDB group and 51% 
for the face-to-face group. The low cost of the DVDB 
intervention meant that it was highly likely to be the most 
cost-effective option.
744 adverse events occurred in 272 (42%) of 655 patients, 
with 101 (39%) of 261 patients in the DVDB group, 
55 (42%) of 132 patients in the face-to-face group, and 
132 (50%) of 262 in the usual care group, with patients 
reporting one or more event. 11 (4%) patients in the 
DVDB group, four (3%) patients in the face-to-face group, 
and 20 (8%) patients in the control group had a serious 
adverse event. Three deaths occurred that were 
considered not to be related to the study (one in the 
DVDB group and two in the usual care group).
Patient experiences of both interventions were 
favourable in those returning the 3-month questionnaires 
and in the qualitative interviews, with all of the 
132 patients in the face-to-face group returning their 
questionnaire and 256 (98%) of 261 patients in the DVDB 
group reporting practising the techniques. Perceived 
benefits included increased control over breathing, 
reduced need for medication, feeling more relaxed, and 
improved quality of life (appendix).

breathing exercises improve disease-related quality of life 
for adults with asthma, and we have also shown that 
equivalent improvements can be achieved from a self-
guided digital audiovisual programme. This programme 
was cost-effective14 and was considered to be an acceptable 
intervention method by patients.
Breathing retraining exercises are of considerable 
interest to people with asthma, and are recommended in 
evidence-based guidelines as possible adjuvant treatment 
for patients whose symptoms are not adequately 
controlled by pharmacological treatment.1,7 The current 
evidence base for breathing retraining in asthma has 
been assessed as convincing by some systematic 
reviews,21 and the most recent Cochrane review22 has 
reported encouraging trends, but called for further, 
adequately powered and methodically sound research. 
Current access to breathing retraining therapy within the 
NHS is limited by the availability of suitably trained 
physiotherapists and the logistical and econo 
mical 
challenges to providing face-to-face therapy to a wider 
population.
To our knowledge, we report the largest trial of 
breathing retraining in asthma to date. A pragmatic trial 
design was used, which aimed to recruit a representative 
patient population (with minimal exclusion criteria) and 
to minimally disrupt the process of normal care, to 
maximise generalisability of the results. The main 
finding of this study is that asthma-related quality-of-life 
impairment is equivalently improved by the routine face-
to-face delivery method for breathing retraining and our 
alternative intervention of a digital self-guided pro-
gramme of physiotherapy-based breathing retraining. 
We confirmed improvements in quality-of-life scores 
over usual care previously reported in smaller studies for 
face-to-face physiotherapist-taught programmes, and 
additionally showed that the DVDB programme results 
in equivalent clinically relevant benefits more conven-
iently and less expensively. To show that a new 
intervention is as effective as an established one, an 
equivalence margin must be specified for the primary 
outcome, and the 95% CI for the difference in effect 
between treatments contained within this margin. Our 
predefined equivalence margin was –0·3 to 0·3 AQLQ 
units, on the basis of a previously reported equivalence 
study.22 We actually observed a small numerical difference 
favouring the DVDB intervention over face-to-face 
treatment (0·04), with the 95% CIs being well within our 
predefined margin (–0·16 to 0·24), giving us confidence 
that we have demon 
strated equivalence.
In agreement with previous studies,6 no significant 
changes in airway obstruction (as assessed by measures 
of respiratory physiology such as FEV1 and PEFR) or 
inflammation (by assessment of FENO) were observed, 
suggesting that breathing retraining provides a technique 
for coping better with the consequences and ongoing 
effects of having asthma, but is not disease-modifying. 
Therefore this intervention is unlikely to reduce the need 
for anti-inflammatory medication, so acts as adjuvant 
rather than replacement for pharmacotherapy. The 
programme was accepted well and engaged with by 
patients and could be implemented into routine care 
with low resource investment.
The importance of a pragmatic trial design to assess the 
real-world effectiveness of an intervention is recognised.12 
Therefore, this randomised trial aimed to recruit a typical 
asthma population reflecting the heterogeneity of routine 
practice, and allowed normal care to proceed as much as 
possible. It was not possible to mask participants to 
intervention allocation, but observations and analyses 
were done by researchers masked to group allocation. A 
limitation of the study is that of the individuals invited to 
participate, only 10% were enrolled, with a slightly older 
age profile than the overall UK adult asthma population, 
and thus might represent an atypical population that 
might be more prepared to consider breathing retraining. 
We recruited patients aged 16–70 years, and the median 
age of participants in the trial was 57 years. UK survey 
data from 2016 report that the prevalence of asthma in 
England in the 25–49 year age group is 10%, 11% in the 
50–64 year age group, and 13% in the over 65 year age 
group. There was a modest over-representation of older 
people in our trial, probably reflecting the fact that people 
aged over 60 years are more likely to agree to participate 
in a clinical trial; therefore, further work is required to 
confirm effectiveness in younger age groups. The 
requirement to attend study-related visits and to complete 
questionnaires might have put some people off partici-
pating in the study, but preceding qualitative work 
indicates that the intervention itself would be widely 
acceptable.10
The mean improvement from baseline AQLQ scores 
was 1·1 for both the DVDB and face-to-face groups, and 
0·8 in the usual care group, with 0·5 equating to a 
clinically important improvement and 1·0 to a large 
improvement,20 suggesting that, on average, participants 
in all groups had clinically relevant improvements in 
quality of life over the study period. A previous pragmatic 
active comparator clinical trial in a population of adult 
patients with suboptimally controlled asthma, reported 
within-group improvements from baseline in AQLQ 
scores similar to those observed in our study by the 
addition of either a long-acting β agonist (mean difference 
from baseline 1·0) or of a leukotriene receptor antagonist 
(0·8).23 In our study, there was also a marked improvement 
from baseline in the usual care group, which is likely to 
relate to regression to the mean and trial involvement 
effects, but significant improve 
ments remained in both 
intervention groups compared with the usual care group.
The qualitative and quantitative process assessments 
indicated that most participants engaged with breathing 
retraining, whether it was delivered face-to-face or via 
DVDB. In the 3-month postal questionnaires, there was 
an overall response rate of 388 (99%) of 393 patients in 
the two intervention groups, with high proportions

reporting

engagement 
with 
the 
active 
interventions and at least some level of practice (256 [98%] 
of 261 in the DVDB group and 132 [100%] of 132 in the 
face-to-face group). The amount of practice reported by 
patients was variable, and higher in the face-to-face group 
than in the DVDB group, although this was not associated 
with improved outcomes and there was no apparent 
evidence of a dose-response association between the 
amount of practice in the techniques and clinical benefit. 
The aim of breathing retraining is to teach patients how 
to adjust their behaviour so that they can embed the 
techniques into their daily lives. Whether there is a 
minimum amount of practice required to learn and 
benefit from the breathing retraining techniques, and 
whether repeated training is needed at some future time, 
is not clear from this study and requires future 
investigation.
Although the significant group mean improvements 
that we report in both breathing retraining groups are 
below the minimum clinically important difference for 
an individual patient, the developers of the AQLQ 
instrument explicitly state that even if the mean 
difference between a treatment and a control is 
appreciably less than the smallest change, treatment 
might have an important effect on many patients.20 
Similarly, one networked meta-analysis of pharma-
cological randomised trials assessing the magnitude of 
treatment effects on AQLQ,18 stated that the established 
within-patient minimum clinically important difference 
for ACQ and AQLQ is not achievable as a group-wise 
efficacy threshold between treatment groups in clinical 
studies. This meta-analysis reported that the mean 
improvements from the addition of a long-acting 
β agonist compared with control were 0·35 (95% CI 
0·27 to 0·43), 0·20 (0·13 to 0·27) from the addition of 
leukotriene receptor antagonists, 0·01 (–0·20 to 0·22) 
from the addition of theophylline, and 0·31 (0·20 to 0·41) 
from the addition of omalizumab.18 By comparison, 
improvements in our study from the DVDB intervention 
compared with usual care were 0·28 (95% CI 0·11 to 0·44), 
and 0·24 (0·04 to 0·44) for face-to-face physio 
therapy 
compared with usual care. From a patient perspective, 
the quality of life improvements achieved from both 
physiotherapy-based programmes in this randomised 
trial were, therefore, of similar magnitude to those 
associated with commonly used pharmacological step-up 
strategies, and could be considered either in addition to, 
or instead of, increases in drug treatment. Whether 
improvements associated with pharmacological and non-
pharmacological strategies are additive is not known.
The heterogeneity of asthma is increasingly recognised, 
with evidence of identifiable clinical phenotypes.24,25 
However, a weak association is consistently observed 
between patient-reported outcome measures and so-
called objective parameters measuring airway physiology 
or inflammation,26,27 although a stronger association has 
been reported between outcomes and psychosocial 
factors.28,29 Personalised precision medicine aims to target 
treatments to individuals based on a multi-dimensional 
assessment incorporating biomarker, phenotypic, and 
psychosocial characterisation, and an individualised 
approach based on treatable traits has been advocated in 
airways disease.30 There is growing evidence that inflam-
matory biomarkers can identify individuals who will 
respond to targeted anti-inflammatory treatments in 
asthma.31,32 It has been less clear how to meet the needs of 
symptomatic individuals without objective evidence of an 
abnormal and pharmacologically modifiable pathway. We 
believe that it is now possible to offer this simple non-
pharmacological intervention as a part of a rational 
overall asthma treatment strategy.
The use of DVDs has declined since the inception of 
the study, with a corresponding growth in online and 
streamed sources for provision of digital information and 
entertainment. Accordingly, to make this intervention 
accessible to clinicians, researchers, and people with 
asthma, we have made the content of the DVD and the 
supporting booklet freely available online through the 
Breathe study website. Additionally, we are in the process 
of producing a web-optimised version of the intervention 
for online use, in collaboration with our partner patient 
charity, Asthma UK, and we anticipate that this material 
will be freely available to patients and professionals in 
2018. The low cost of providing an internet-based 
intervention, the ease of access of content and the 
absence of adverse outcomes using such approaches 
indicate that this evidence-based non-pharmacological 
intervention can now be offered to people with asthma 
with persisting quality-of-life impair 
ment despite current 
asthma medication. There is a need to stress to patients 
that this intervention is in addition to, not instead of, 
current medication, and that it does not cure asthma, but 
rather is a means to improve quality of life.

intervention and the process assessments. SG, MM, PL, RD, DP, IDP, 
and STH provided input into the original trial design, supporte d the 
trial management and advised on interpretation and presentation of 
results. JR designed the health economic component and was a member 
of the trial management group, with the health economic analyses done 
by SZ and GY. EA-C and SK were involved in the digital intervention 
development process and in the quantitative and qualitative process 
assessments. JV was involved in the original study conception (at the 
time being the research lead for Asthma UK) and provided public and 
patient involvement input, along with MS-W (both of whom attended 
trial management meetings as PPI representatives). DG was involved in 
the intervention development. FW and LT were involved in the 
organisation and delivery of the study. All authors were involved in 
commenting on the manuscript and have approved the submitted 
version.
