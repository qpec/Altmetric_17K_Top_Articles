Abstract
Background: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common subtype of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Standard
first-line treatment for this aggressive subtype comprises the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab combined with
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone. If patients receiving such treatment have an early
relapse, or their disease is initially refractory to such treatment, standard salvage regimens may not be effective.
There is therefore a high unmet clinical need for new targeted agents that might improve the outcome for such
patients. CD19 is a B-lymphocyte lineage-specific cell surface antigen that is expressed by most B-cell non-Hodgkin’s
lymphomas. MOR208 is an fragment-crystallizable engineered humanized monoclonal antibody with enhanced
antitumor activity that targets CD19 and that may consequently have clinical utility in this setting.
Case presentation: We describe the case of a 33-year-old Caucasian man who presented with a 3-month history of
general symptoms and who was admitted to our pulmonology ward with dyspnea due to pneumonia and severe
anemia. A histopathological examination of an enlarged right suprasternal lymph node confirmed a diagnosis of T-cell/
histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma, an uncommon morphological variant of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Our
patient had a complete response to first-line rituximab combined with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and
prednisone, but had an early relapse 5 months after the end of treatment. After intensive salvage therapy consolidated
with an autologous stem-cell transplant, our patient again had an early relapse and was subsequently enrolled in a
phase IIa trial of single-agent MOR208. Following a scheduled 3 months of weekly treatment, a partial response was
confirmed and MOR208 was continued as maintenance therapy, with administration every second week. Positron
emission tomography-computed tomography confirmed a complete response 9 months later. This response is ongoing,
with a duration of 24 months. MOR208 was well-tolerated by our patient and his quality of life and performance status
remain high. No hospitalizations were required and our patient engaged in full-time work and physical activities.
Conclusion: Third-line single-agent therapy with the CD19 antibody MOR208 was highly effective in this patient, despite
a history of early relapse after standard first-line and second-line treatment regimens. These data provide support for
future randomized studies of MOR208.

 Background
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most com-
mon subtype of B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL),
accounting for 30–40 % of cases overall [1]. Immunochem-
otherapy with the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab, combined
with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and pred-
nisone (R-CHOP), a current standard first-line treatment
for this aggressive subtype, has been shown to increase both
response rates and survival compared with CHOP chemo-
therapy alone [2]. If patients subsequently relapse after such
therapy, recommended further treatments in patients of
adequate performance status include salvage chemotherapy
followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem
cell transplantation (ASCT) [3]. Patients with primary re-
sistance or early relapse within the first 3–6 months after
previous therapy have a particularly bad prognosis. Escalat-
ing the chemotherapy dose, even high-dose chemotherapy
with autologous stem cell support, is less effective in the
post-rituximab era than in the pre-rituximab era. In
addition, allogeneic transplants may be offered only to
selected, fit patients.
Few salvage regimens are effective in patients with DLBCL
that relapses soon after, or is refractory to, first-line rituxi-
mab plus chemotherapy [4]. There is therefore a clinical
need for new targeted agents that might improve outcome
for such patients. MOR208 (XmAb®5574, MOR00208) is an
fragment crystallizable (Fc)-engineered humanized CD19
monoclonal antibody, which in preclinical studies has shown
potent in vitro and in vivo activity in leukemia and lymph-
oma model systems. The Fc engineering results in en-
hanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and
antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis compared with
the non-engineered parental antibody, as well as direct
cytotoxic effects (apoptosis) on tumor cells [5, 6]. CD19 is a
type I transmembrane glycoprotein expressed throughout
B-cell development and, consequently, by most B-cell
NHLs. CD19 is not expressed by most other normal cell
types, making this cell surface protein a potentially highly
effective therapeutic anticancer target. Indeed, a phase I
dose-escalation study showed MOR208 to be safe and
well-tolerated with encouraging single-agent activity in
patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) [7].
In this report, we present the case of a patient with
DLBCL, relapsing within the first 6 months after R-CHOP
chemotherapy, with a second early relapse experienced
after intensive salvage therapy consolidated with ASCT.
Our patient was successfully treated with MOR208 in the
MOR208C201 clinical trial (EudraCT number: 2012-
002659-41; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01685008).
Case presentation
Our 33-year-old male Caucasian patient presented with
a 3-month history of general symptoms (weakness,
excessive sweating, and episodes of low-grade fever) and
was admitted to our pulmonology ward with dyspnea
due to pneumonia and severe anemia (hemoglobin of
8.5 g/dl). A physical examination revealed enlargement
of his right suprasternal lymph node, later excised for
histopathology (Fig. 1). This confirmed a diagnosis of
CD20-positive T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymph-
oma (THRLBCL), an uncommon morphological variant
of DLBCL [8]. The neoplastic cells were CD19-positive,
partially positive for CD30, and negative for CD15. At
diagnosis, routine computed tomography (CT)-based
staging confirmed Ann Arbor stage IVB disease, with
generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly
(enlarged lymph nodes of the neck [subclavicular on
right side], mediastinum [subcarinal, para-aortic, right
pulmonary hilum, left pulmonary hilum], right axilla,
and abdomen [celiac, para-aortic, para-iliac, spleen]). He
also had sclerotic lesions of the ninth, tenth and twelfth
thoracic vertebrae. A lumbar puncture with cerebro-
spinal fluid analysis excluded central nervous system
(CNS) lymphoma involvement; in addition, an increased
concentration
of
total
protein
showed
no
sign
of
oligoclonal bands. Our patient was deemed to have an
age-adjusted International Prognostic Index (IPI) score
[9] of 3 (stage IV, two extra-nodal sites, low lactate
dehydrogenase, poor performance status, age <60 years).
Standard R-CHOP immunochemotherapy was admin-
istered to our patient as a first-line regimen (Table 1).
As in all high-risk cases, liposomal cytarabine (DepoCyte
50 mg) was administered via the intrathecal route during
the first four cycles for prophylaxis of CNS relapse. A
good clinical response was confirmed by CT imaging
after the third cycle (partial response; PR), followed
by a complete response (CR) after eight cycles (treat-
ment schema, Fig. 2) that was confirmed by positron
emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT).
During this first-line therapy, our patient twice developed
neutropenic fever, which necessitated prolonged hospital
admission, despite granulocyte-colony stimulating factor
(G-CSF) primary prophylaxis.
Early relapse was confirmed 5 months after completion
of first-line therapy. PET-CT imaging revealed multiple
sites of high standard uptake values (SUVs), including the
mediastinum blood pool structure (MBPS) and various
sites in his head and neck region (parotid glands, palatine
tonsils, submandibular lymph nodes), thorax (supraclavi-
cular lymph nodes on the left, paratracheal chain), and
abdomen (para-aortic lymph nodes, stomach, spleen, and
liver [Deauville 5]). Elevated SUVs were also detected in
his skeletal system, although there was no infection,
nor G-CSF used, at that time. Radiological examin-
ation also revealed a right-side pleural effusion; in the
absence of hypoalbuminemia or heart failure, this was
also most likely related to the lymphoma.

 As second-line salvage chemotherapy, our patient re-
ceived three cycles of rituximab, etoposide, methylprednis-
olone, cisplatin, and cytarabine (R-ESHAP; Table 1). A
PET-CT assessment demonstrated a PR to this second-line
chemotherapy. A fourth cycle of salvage chemotherapy
was then administered: dexamethasone, carmustine, etopo-
side, cytarabine, and melphalan (DexaBEAM), followed by
ibritumomab tiuxetan, carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine,
and melphalan (Z-BEAM)-conditioned ASCT (Table 1).
This led to a CR, as confirmed by PET-CT. Our patient’s
quality of life during second-line treatment and ASCT was
poor, due to prolonged hospital admissions and his great
concerns relating to potential severe complications of each
of the salvage regimens.
At a 3-month follow-up visit after ASCT, our patient
presented in good clinical condition and demonstrated
weight gain. He had good hematopoietic reconstitution
and elevated liver function tests, despite negative tests
for hepatitis B and C. Although there were no clinical
symptoms of disease or infection, a PET-CT assessment
demonstrated increased metabolic activity consistent with
early relapse, with high SUVs in the Waldeyer ring (palat-
ine tonsils, pharyngeal tonsil, submandibular lymph nodes),
the cervical lymph nodes on his left side, the axillary lymph
nodes bilaterally, and his stomach, spleen (with splenomeg-
aly), MBPS, and liver (Deauville 5).
At this point, our patient was enrolled in the MOR208
clinical study. During the first 12 weeks of treatment,
MOR208 was administered intravenously at 12 mg/kg,
once a week. Peripheral blood lymphocyte immunophe-
notyping by flow cytometry revealed prompt clearance
of B-lymphocytes from his peripheral blood; in particu-
lar, a decrease in CD3−, CD56−, CD16−, and CD45+ B-
lymphocytes and a compensatory increase in CD45+
and CD3+ T-lymphocytes was observed (Fig. 3). Three
months after starting third-line MOR208 therapy, PET-
CT assessments demonstrated a PR, with only a small
number of metabolically active lymph nodes (palatine,
cervical on his left side, axillary on his left side, axillary
on his right side, lower part of his esophagus, MBPS,
liver). Following the scheduled 12 weeks of treatment,
MOR208 was continued as maintenance therapy, with
administration every second week. PET-CT confirmed a
CR 9 months later (Fig. 4).
MOR208 was very well-tolerated, with few adverse
events. Our patient developed four upper respiratory tract
infections, comprising three instances of pharyngitis that
required symptomatic treatment and one incident of
bronchitis, which necessitated antibiotic therapy (amoxi-
cillin with clavulanic acid). Our patient did not have any
hematological adverse events. During treatment with
MOR208, our patient’s quality of life and performance

 status remained high (World Health Organization grade
0, Karnofsky score 100 %). No hospitalizations were
required; all procedures were performed in a day clinic.
Our patient engaged in full-time work and physical activ-
ities. He continues to be well, with an ongoing duration of
response of 24 months.
Discussion
The original CHOP chemotherapy regimen was intro-
duced by the National Cancer Institute in the mid-
seventies. The value of this regimen in the treatment of
advanced stage NHL was proven 20 years later in a ran-
domized comparison with so-called second-generation
and third-generation regimens [10]. The first and, so far,
only indisputable improvement to this regimen has been
the incorporation of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody
rituximab [11]. In particular, the addition of rituximab to
CHOP was shown to significantly increase the CR rate,
and significantly prolong event-free and overall survival in
the first-line treatment of elderly patients with DLBCL.
The addition of rituximab to re-induction chemotherapy
was also shown to significantly prolong failure-free and
progression-free survival in patients with relapsing aggres-
sive CD20+ NHL that had not previously been treated
with rituximab [12]. In the pre-rituximab era, high-dose
therapy with ASCT allowed the rescue of nearly half of
the patients responding to salvage therapy [13]. In the
post-rituximab era, the CORAL study in patients with
CD20+ relapsed/refractory DLBCL who were random-
ized to rituximab plus one of two salvage chemotherapy
regimens showed that in patients with early relapse
(<12 months), prior rituximab treatment was associated
with poor prognosis [4]. Patients in this study with the

 molecular activated B-cell (ABC)-like subtype of DLBCL
had a particularly poor outcome, irrespective of the
assigned salvage therapy [14].
If NHLs are either initially resistant or subsequently
develop resistance to rituximab, targeted agents directed
against proteins other than CD20 may improve patient
outcome.
The
B-lymphocyte
lineage-specific
surface
antigen CD19 may represent one such alternative anti-
cancer target. Early-stage studies of a number of CD19-
targeted agents have provided encouraging data in
patients with CLL and DLBCL [15]. In particular, the
CD19 antibody MOR208 provided initial evidence for
clinical activity in a phase I dose-escalation study in
patients with relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL [7], as well
as in the phase IIa NHL study in which our patient is
enrolled [16]. In the CLL phase I trial, eight (30 %) of 27
enrolled patients had a PR, and a further 16 had stable
disease on the basis of CT criteria, physical examination,
and
laboratory
studies
(International Workshop
on
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia criteria [17]). In particu-
lar, of the 16 patients treated at the recommended phase
II dose of 12 mg/kg weekly, six (38 %) had a PR. The most
frequent treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of
any grade were infusion-related reactions, which occurred
in 11 (67 %) of 27 patients (all grade 1–2), despite pre-
medication. The most common grade 3/4 TEAE was neu-
tropenia (six patients, 22 %). Five patients (19 %) had
grade 3/4 treatment-related TEAEs. One drug-limiting
toxicity, grade 4 neutropenia lasting ≥7 days, was observed
at the maximum administered dose of 12 mg/kg. The

 objective response rate in the NHL phase IIa trial was
23 % (21 of 92 patients); responses were seen in nine
(26 %) of 35 patients with DLBCL, nine (26 %) of 34
patients with follicular lymphoma, and in three (27 %)
of 11 patients with other indolent NHLs. Nine (10 %)
patients
experienced
infusion-related
reactions
that
were all grade 1–2 (except for one case of dyspnea,
grade 4). Non-hematological and hematological TEAEs
of grade 3 or above were seen in 24 (26 %) and 14 (15 %)
of 92 patients, respectively. However, our patient did not
experience severe hematological or non-hematological
TEAEs during treatment with MOR208.
In our patient, we observed an early relapse after first-
line R-CHOP chemotherapy, consistent with a dynamic
and aggressive lymphoma with a likely poor prognosis.
Although our patient underwent salvage chemotherapy
followed by ASCT supported by the Z-BEAM condition-
ing regimen, the disease again proved resistant to treat-
ment, and our patient experienced an early relapse.
Considering these rapid relapses at both prior treatment
steps, it was deemed to be very unlikely that palliative
radiotherapy would have effectively cured the disease and
prevented distant metastases. Given the exhaustion of all
other available treatment options at our institution, third-
line treatment with MOR208 was considered as a possible
salvage therapy. Our patient was deemed to be eligible for
a phase IIa, open-label, multicenter study of single-agent
MOR208 in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL.
The MOR208 regimen was based on the 12 mg/kg weekly
dose recommended in the phase I study [7]. This treat-
ment changed the lymphoma dynamics, possibly prevent-
ing its spread to distant sites, and provided extended
progression-free survival for our patient (5 months after
the R-CHOP chemotherapy and 6 months after BEAM
ASCT versus over 20 months during the treatment with
MOR208; Fig. 2). His quality of life was excellent and
greatly improved compared with previous therapies. He
participated in normal daily activities and the treatment
was conducted primarily in an outpatient setting.
Conclusions
The CD19 monoclonal antibody MOR208 was an effective
third-line treatment in this patient with DLBCL, despite a
history of early relapse following a standard first-line regi-
men and a second-line treatment regimen that included
ASCT. These results support the development of random-
ized studies of MOR208 therapy in patients with relapsed
or refractory DLBCL.
