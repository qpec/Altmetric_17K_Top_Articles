OBJECTIVES: To describe firearm storage practices in homes with children who have versus do 
not have self-harm risk factors.
METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of a nationally representative probability-based online 
survey of US adults conducted in 2015 (n = 3949; response rate 55%). Respondents self-
reported whether they lived with children and were a caretaker/health care decision-
maker for a child. Household firearm ownership was ascertained for all respondents; how 
firearms were stored in homes with guns was asked of gun owning respondents only; all 
respondents were asked whether their child had a history of the following self-harm risk 
factors: depression, mental health conditions other than depression, or attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder.
RESULTS: Household firearms were present in 43.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 34.4–64.7)  
of homes with children who had a history of self-harm risk factors (n = 52), compared with 
42.3% (95% CI: 35.2–49.7) of homes in which no child had self-harm risk factors  
(n = 411). Among parents or caretakers with firearms, 34.9% (95 % CI: 20.2–53.2) stored 
all guns locked and unloaded when they had a child with a history self-harm risk factors, 
compared with 31.8% (95% CI: 25.9–38.3) when none of their children had such a history.
CONCLUSIONS: Millions of US children live in homes in which firearms are left loaded or 
unlocked or both. A child’s history of depression, mental health conditions other than 
depression, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder does not appear to appreciably 
influence caretaker decisions about whether to (1) have firearms in the home, or  
(2) store all household firearms in accordance with American Academy of Pediatrics 
recommendations (ie, locked and unloaded).

 In 2015, the most recent year for 
which mortality data are available, 
suicide was the second leading cause 
of death for children aged 10 to 17 
years of age.1 For children in this 
age group, firearms accounted for 
over 40% of all suicides.1 Guidelines 
intended to reduce firearm injury 
to children, first issued by the 
American Academy of Pediatrics 
(AAP) in 1992, 
2 assert that whereas 
the safest home for a child is one 
without firearms, risk can be 
reduced substantially, although not 
eliminated, by storing all household 
firearms locked, unloaded, and 
separate from ammunition. The 
AAP recommendations reflect 3 
well-established observations: 
(1) the source of most of the 
firearms involved in suicide (and 
unintentional firearm deaths) 
among children is their home, 
3 (2) 
the presence of guns in a child’s 
home substantially increases the 
risk of suicide (and unintentional 
firearm death), 
4 
– 
17 and (3) the risk 
of unintentional and self-inflicted 
firearm injury is lower in homes that 
store firearms unloaded (compared 
with loaded) and locked (compared 
with unlocked).18
Despite AAP recommendations to 
make firearms less accessible to 
children, and the fact that mental 
health conditions increase the 
likelihood of suicidal behavior, 
19 little 
is known about whether parents 
whose children have mental health 
conditions are any less likely to live 
in homes with firearms, or for that 
matter, whether in homes with guns 
and children, household firearm 
storage depends on whether children 
in the home have a history of self-
harm risk factors. We are aware of 
only 2 pediatric studies in which 
the authors examined related, but 
distinct questions. In the first study, 
a nationally representative sample 
of adolescents interviewed between 
2001 and 2003, the authors found 
that those with self-reported mental 
health conditions were as likely to 
report easy access to firearms as 
were adolescents without mental 
health conditions.20 Firearm storage 
practices were not ascertained. In 
the second study, a 2004 survey of 
adolescents’ parents or guardians 
enrolled in a managed care plan who 
lived in homes with firearms, the 
authors found that adolescents with 
a diagnosis of depression or bipolar 
disorder (based on medical claims 
data) compared with adolescents 
without mental illness were neither 
more nor less likely to live in homes 
in which all firearms were stored 
locked, any firearms were stored 
loaded, or all firearms were stored 
unloaded and locked.21
The current nationally representative 
study examines (1) whether parents 
whose children have self-harm risk 
factors are any less (or more) likely 
to live in homes with guns, and (2) 
whether parents with firearms store 
their household guns more (or less) 
safely when a child of theirs has a 
history of self-harm risk factors.

Design and sampling
We used data from a Web-based 
survey designed by the authors 
[D.A., M.M.] and conducted by the 
survey firm Growth for Knowledge 
(GfK) to assess firearm ownership, 
storage practices, and use among a 
nationally representative sample of 
US adults. Respondents were drawn 
from GfK’s KnowledgePanel (KP), a 
group of ∼55 000 US adults selected 
(on an ongoing basis) with an equal 
probability of selection. All panel 
members, except those currently 
serving in the US Armed Forces, were 
eligible to participate. Gun owners 
and veterans were oversampled from 
the KP; sampling weights supplied by 
GfK were applied such that estimates 
from the survey are representative of 
US adults (aged ≥18 years) in 2015.
Survey pretesting occurred in March 
2015, with administration of the 
final survey in April 2015. Potentially 
eligible panel members received a 
notification e-mail letting them know 
that a new survey was available for 
them to take. No description of the 
survey content accompanied the 
invitation. This e-mail notification 
contained a link that sent them to the 
survey questionnaire. No login name 
or password was required. After 3 
days, automatic e-mail reminders 
were sent to all nonresponding panel 
members in the sample. Participants 
completed the main survey within a 
median of 14 minutes.
Unique identifiers linked respondents 
in our survey to routine profile data 
collected by GfK on all KP panel 
members to ascertain self-reported 
mental and behavioral health 
conditions for respondents and their 
children. Response to GfK surveys 
is motivated through a point system 
by which responders accrue points 
that are redeemable for merchandise, 
cash or participation in sweepstakes. 
All panel members were eligible 
for survey participation except 
those serving on active duty in the 
US Armed Forces. The Institutional 
Review Board of Northeastern 
University approved the study.
GfK structures recruitment for 
the KP with the goal of having 
the resulting panel represent the 
adult population of the United 
States with respect to a broad set 
of geodemographic distributions 
as well as particular subgroups of 
hard-to-reach adults (for example, 
those without a landline telephone 
or those who primarily speak 
Spanish). For selection of general 
population samples from KP, GfK 
uses an equal probability of selection 
method design by weighting the 
entire KP to the benchmarks from 
the latest March supplement of the 
US Census Current Population Survey 
(see Supplemental Information for 
details). Sampling weights supplied 
by GfK were applied such that 
estimates made from the survey 
are representative of US adults

percentages and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) to describe outcomes.
Measures
Household gun ownership was 
assessed by asking respondents, 
“Do you or does anyone else you 
live with currently own any type of 
gun?” Personal gun ownership was 
assessed with a follow-up question: 
“Do you personally own a gun?” Gun 
owners were then asked follow-up 
questions about various storage 
practices for their household guns 
(eg, the number of guns stored 
loaded and unlocked, loaded and 
locked, unloaded and unlocked, and 
locked and unloaded).
We classified household firearms 
based on the least safely stored 
firearm. After having ascertained 
how many handguns and how many 
long guns a respondent owned, 
respondents were asked separately 
about the number of handguns and 
then about the number of long guns 
stored (1) loaded and unlocked, 
(2) unloaded and locked, and (3) 
in some other manner. For each 
type of gun we asked, “how many 
are stored locked and unloaded?”; 
the respondent would answer 
with an integer. Storage was not 
ascertained about guns individually 
(unless the respondent owned only 
1 handgun and/or 1 long gun). 
Responses were sorted into 1 of 3 
mutually exclusive, hierarchical, and 
collectively exhaustive categories: 
Category A (at least 1 gun loaded and 
unlocked); Category B (no guns in 
Category A but at least 1 gun either 
loaded and locked, or unlocked 
and unloaded), and Category C (all 
guns stored locked and unloaded). 
We also characterized household 
firearm storage more broadly, into 2 
potentially overlapping categories: 
(1) any firearms stored unlocked, and 
(2) any stored loaded.
Basic demographic information was 
also elicited, as was information 
about the number of children in the 
household and whether any of these 
children fit into 3 mutually exclusive 
age categories (between 0–5 years, 
6–12 years but none younger, 
and 13–17 years of age but none 
younger).
Because not all adults who live in 
homes with children are the child’s 
parent or guardian, we further 
ascertained the relationship between 
adult respondents who live in homes 
with children by asking respondents 
if they were “a caregiver or health 
care decision-maker for a child 
under the age of 18?” Hereafter we 
refer to respondents who responded 
affirmatively to the caretaker and 
guardian question as “parents.” 
Members of the GfK panel were 
also asked: “Are you a caregiver 
for a child under 18 with any of the 
following medical conditions (eg, 
depression).” Respondents could 
answer “yes” or “no” to the following 
3 categories of conditions: attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
(ADHD) or attention-deficit disorder, 
depression, and mental health 
conditions other than depression. 
Respondents who answered “yes” 
to any of these 3 categories of 
established self-harm risk factors22 
– 
24 
were said to have a child with a self-
harm risk factor. Respondents were 
not asked more specifically about 
these conditions (eg, we do not know 
whether children said to have these 
conditions ever received a formal 
diagnosis, or if respondents were 
asked whether their child had other 
mental health or behavioral health 
conditions more specifically).
We conducted all analyses by using 
Stata IC 14 (StataCorp, College 
Station, TX), with use of appropriate 
weighting commands (using the 
weight variable provided by GfK) 
to generate national estimates and 
following the Strengthening the 
Reporting of Observational Studies 
in Epidemiology guidelines for 
reporting.25
Results
Of the 7318 invited panel members 
who received the survey, 4165 began 
the survey and 3949 completed it 
(excluding 48 active-duty military 
personnel who began the survey 
but were ineligible to complete it). 
This yielded a survey completion 
proportion of 54.6% based on 
the formula recommended for 
calculating response proportions for 
Web panels.26 Characteristics of the 
underlying sample are presented in 
 
Table 1.
Firearm Prevalence
Approximately 1 in 3 US households 
contained firearms (34.8%; 95% CI: 
32.2–36.8), irrespective of whether 
the household contains children 
(33.4%; 95% CI: 29.1–38.0), or not 
(34.9%; 95% CI: 29.1–38.0) (Fig 1). 
Among the subset of adults who self-
identified as a caregiver or health 
care decision-maker for a child under 
the age of 18, ∼2 in 5 households 
contained firearms (42.4%; 95% CI: 
35.7–49.4), whether the children in 
the household had a history of self-
harm risk factors (43.5%; 95% CI: 
24.0–65.2), or not (42.3%; 95% CI: 
35.2–49.7) (Fig 1).
Firearm storage
Among parents who own guns, only 
1 in 3 stored all household firearms 
locked and unloaded, regardless 
of whether their child had or did 
not have a history of depression, 
mental health conditions other than 
depression, or ADHD (34.9% [95% 
CI: 20.2–53.2] vs 31.8% [95% CI: 
25.9–38.3], respectively) (Fig 1). The 
proportion of gun-owning parents 
who store at least 1 household 
firearm both loaded and unlocked 
is lower, but not significantly so, 
for parents whose children have 
a history of these self-harm risk 
factors, compared with parents 
none of whose children have such a 
history (11.6% [95% CI: 4.3–27.6] 
vs 20.3% [95% CI: 15.3–26.4], 
respectively) (Fig 1). Gun-owning

 parents who have children with a 
history of depression, mental health 
conditions other than depression, or 
ADHD are also not significantly more 
likely to store all household firearms 
locked, compared with those whose 
children do not have such a history 
of self-harm risk factors (62.0% 
[95% CI: 44.8–76.6] vs 52.2% [95% 
CI: 45.3–58.9], respectively) (Table 
2). Likewise, the proportion of 
gun-owning parents who store all 
household firearms unloaded does 
not does not depend on whether their 
child has or does not have a history 
of mental health conditions or ADHD 
(58.7% [95% CI: 41.2–74.3] vs 57.9% 
[95% CI: 51.0–64.5], respectively) 
(Table 2).
characteristics of households With 
Firearms and children
In homes that contain firearms, 
parents whose children have a 
history of mental health conditions 
or ADHD tend to have more children 
and a greater proportion of children 
in older age groups. For example, 
approximately one-third (36.1%; 
95% CI: 30.5–42.1) of parents, none 
of whose children have a history 
of mental health conditions or 
ADHD, have children 0 to 5 years 
of age compared with 7% (95% 
CI: 2.3–19.2) of parents who have 
at least 1 child with such a history 
(Table 2). Whether a child has a 
history these self-harm risk factors 
does not appear to appreciably 
affect the distribution of the other 
measured parental and household 
characteristics.
DIscussIOn
To our knowledge, in the current 
study, we are the first to use a 
nationally representative sample to 
examine whether having a child with 
a history of mental health conditions 
or ADHD is associated with parental 
reports of (1) household firearm 
prevalence, and (2) how household 
firearms are stored in homes with 
guns and children. Based on our 
findings, it appears that having a 
child with self-harm risk factors 
does not, on average (1) factor into 
parents’ decision to have firearms 
in their homes, or (2) materially 
affect whether parents store all 
household guns in accordance with 
AAP recommendations (locked and 
unloaded).2
Our finding that self-harm risk 
factors among US children are not 
associated with household firearm 
prevalence mirrors findings from 4 
previous US studies of adults from 
the early 2000s, in each of which 
authors found that the prevalence 
of mental health disorders was 
fairly balanced across households 
with firearms versus without 
firearms.21,

 finding that parent’s report of their 
child’s history of self-harm risk 
factors did not predict whether 
parents stored household firearms 
locked and unloaded is consistent 
with findings from a nationally 
representative study of adults 
that failed to find an association 
between an adult’s mental health 
history and the likelihood of living 
in a home in which firearms were 
stored loaded and unlocked.28 
Moreover, our findings regarding 
storage practices are in line with a 
nationally representative survey of 
13 to 18 year old adolescents who 
were interviewed between 2001 
and 2003 and asked a related, but 
distinct, question about self-reported 
access to firearms in the home. In 
that study, adolescents with self-
reported mental health risk factors 
for suicide were as likely to report 
easy access to household firearms as 
were adolescents without risk factors 
for suicide.20
Our findings that household firearm 
prevalence in homes with children 
is modestly higher, albeit with 
overlapping tails of the 95% CIs, 
when prevalence estimates are 
based on respondents who self-
identify as a child’s caregiver or 
health care decision-maker (eg, 
parents) compared with estimates

Downloaded from 
 based on a randomly chosen adult 
living in a home with children (eg, 
an adult sibling, a grandparent, a 
related or unrelated adult boarder) 
has not previously been reported 
(nor to our knowledge, assessed). 
Other survey-based firearm-
related reporting gaps have been 
well documented in the literature, 
especially with respect to sex.30 
– 
33 
The authors of these previous studies 
all suggest that household prevalence 
estimates for a variety of firearm 
related attributes (eg, presence of 
guns, number of guns, how guns 
are stored in the home) depend in 
nontrivial ways on which household 
member contributes information 
to estimates. Historically, estimates 
based on reports of respondents 
who are less familiar with guns 
(eg, females, nongun owners) 
appear to underestimate household 
prevalence and overestimate how 
safely guns are stored (the latter is 
why, by design, our study ascertained 
storage practices from the gun 
owner only). The extent to which 
prevalence discrepancies in our 
study, or in previous work, reflect 
the role of chance, respondent-
dependent differential knowledge 
about household firearm status, 
or differential reluctance to report 
accurate knowledge of firearm status 
is unknown.
Several additional considerations 
should be kept in mind when 
interpreting findings from our 
survey. First, our null finding with 
respect to a child’s history of self-
harm risk factors affecting the 
proportion of parents reporting 
that they store all household 
firearms in accordance with the 
AAP recommendations may, at least 
in part, be confounded by the fact 
that older children are more likely 
to have a history of mental health 
and behavioral conditions (as we 
observe in our study). In previous 
studies, authors have shown that 
although the risk of firearm injury 
is greater for adolescents than for 
younger children, parents tend to 
adopt safer firearm storage practices 
when they have young children, 
compared to when they have only 
older children. 
 
33, 
 
34 Our sample size 
is not large enough to generate 
precise estimates of the relationship 
between firearm storage practices 
and a child’s mental and behavioral 
health history while adjusting for 
the age of children in the home or, 
for that matter, by other potentially 
relevant subgroups, such as type 
of firearm (ie, handgun versus long 
gun). Our sample size also precludes 
stratifying our measure of self-harm 
risk factors, and therefore precludes 
examining effect modification by 
more granular measures of mental or 
behavioral health. Lastly, our study 
is not powered to know whether 
the nonsignificant difference by 
self-harm risk factor status that we 
observed for the least safe storage 
practice measured (ie, 11% vs 20% 
loaded and unlocked) is due to the 
play of chance, or to real differences 
in this particular storage practice. 
Even so, our findings nevertheless 
suggest that too many children in 
every age category and regardless of 
their history of self-harm risk factors 
live in homes in which firearms are 
stored in less than an ideal fashion.
Second, we categorize children 
as having a mental or behavioral 
health condition based on parents’ 
response to survey items that have 
not been validated. This could result 
in misclassification if parents are not 
aware of their child’s full condition 
or withhold relevant information. To 
the extent that such misclassification 
is relevant, extrapolations from our 
findings would likely underestimate 
the number of children with self-
harm risk factors living in homes 
with firearms, but it might also 
obscure differences in storage 
practices when children have 
conditions not reported or if storage 
is related to the severity of a mental 
or behavioral health condition or its 
recency of onset. Authors of larger 
studies that use validated measures 
of mental health and behavioral 
conditions, capture the severity of 
underlying conditions and report 
recency of disorder onset could add 
meaningfully to the findings from the 
current study.
Third, as with findings from all self-
reported surveys, our findings are 
subject to potential inaccuracies 
because of a social desirability bias 
that might lead parents to report 
spuriously safe storage practices, 
especially if their children have risk 
factors for self-harm. However, with 
our findings that one-third of all 
parents who own guns report storing

Downloaded from 
 household firearms unloaded and 
locked up, independent of whether 
they had reported having a child with 
self-harm risk factors, we suggest 
that social desirability bias may not 
play a dominant role in our findings. 
With regard to social desirability bias 
more generally, online panel surveys, 
such as ours, have been shown to 
reduce social desirability bias and 
yield more accurate estimates of 
respondent characteristics compared 
with alternative methods used to 
elicit opinions, such as telephone 
surveys.35 Reduced social desirability 
bias, along with our decision to 
ascertain storage information from 
gun owners only, and secular trends 
favoring handgun over long gun 
ownership (and protection rather 
than recreation as a primary reason 
to own guns), 
36 may help explain 
why we find less optimal storage 
practices in homes with children 
and guns compared with previous 
studies.33, 
 
34, 
37 Another advantage 
of online panels is high completion 
rates for those who begin the survey 
and the availability of information 
about panelists who do not elect to 
take the survey in the first place.26 
In our study, 99% of respondents 
completed the survey, fewer than 1% 
declined to answer our stem question 
about household gun ownership, 
no one declined to answer the 
subsequent question regarding 
whether they personally owned a 
gun, and fewer than 3% declined to 
answer the questions about storage. 
Finally, our survey completion 
rate (55%) is higher than the rates 
for typical nonprobability, opt-in, 
online surveys, which are 2% to 
16%38; higher than those of previous 
national injury surveys that included 
questions about firearm ownership39, 
 
40;  
and similar to those from other 
surveys conducted by GfK.37 
Nevertheless, panel members who 
chose not to participate in our survey 
may have differed in important ways 
related to their storage practices 
compared with panel members who 
chose to participate.
cOnclusIOns
Despite these limitations, our 
findings indicate that parents’ 
decision to store firearms in their 
home does not materially depend on 
whether their child has self-harm risk 
factors, nor, moreover, does having 
a child with a history of self-harm 
risk factors appear to increase the 
likelihood that parents in homes with 
firearms will store their household 
guns as safely as possible. Indeed, for 
homes with children and guns, the 
odds are roughly 2 to 1 that firearms 
are not stored in accordance with 
recommendations promulgated 
by the AAP, regardless of whether 
children in the home have a history 
of self-harm risk factors. Given the 
prevalence of household firearms 
in the United States, our findings 
suggest that millions of US children 
are placed at substantially higher 
risk of fatal firearm injury, especially 
suicide, than would be the case were 
parents to follow guidelines first 
put forward by the AAP more than a 
quarter century ago.
