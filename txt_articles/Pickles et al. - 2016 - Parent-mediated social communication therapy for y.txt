Summary
Background It is not known whether early intervention can improve long-term autism symptom outcomes. We aimed 
to follow-up the Preschool Autism Communication Trial (PACT), to investigate whether the PACT intervention had a 
long-term eff
 ect on autism symptoms and continued eff
 ects on parent and child social interaction.
Methods PACT was a randomised controlled trial of a parent-mediated social communication intervention for 
children aged 2–4 years with core autism. Follow-up ascertainment was done at three specialised clinical services 
centres in the UK (London, Manchester, and Newcastle) at a median of 5·75 years (IQR 5·42–5·92) from the original 
trial endpoint. The main blinded outcomes were the comparative severity score (CSS) from the Autism Diagnostic 
Observation Schedule (ADOS), the Dyadic Communication Assessment Measure (DCMA) of the proportion of child 
initiatiations when interacting with the parent, and an expressive-receptive language composite. All analyses followed 
the intention-to-treat principle. PACT is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN58133827.
Findings 121 (80%) of the 152 trial participants (59 [77%] of 77 assigned to PACT intervention vs 62 [83%] of 75 assigned 
to treatment as usual) were traced and consented to be assessed between July, 2013, and September, 2014. Mean age 
at follow-up was 10·5 years (SD 0·8). Group diff
 erence in favour of the PACT intervention based on ADOS CSS of 
log-odds eff
 ect size (ES) was 0·64 (95% CI 0·07 to 1·20) at treatment endpoint and ES 0·70 (95% CI –0·05 to 1·47) at 
follow-up, giving an overall reduction in symptom severity over the course of the whole trial and follow-up period 
(ES 0·55, 95% CI 0·14 to 0·91, p=0·004). Group diff
 erence in DCMA child initiations at follow-up showed a Cohen’s 
d ES of 0·29 (95% CI –0.02 to 0.57) and was signifi
 cant over the course of the study (ES 0·33, 95% CI 0·11 to 0·57, 
p=0·004). There were no group diff
 erences in the language composite at follow-up (ES 0·15, 95% CI –0·23 to 0·53). 
Interpretation The results are the fi
 rst to show long-term symptom reduction after a randomised controlled trial of 
early intervention in autism spectrum disorder. They support the clinical value of the PACT intervention and have 
implications for developmental theory.

Introduction
Autism spectrum disorder is a common neuro-
developmental disorder that aff
 ects about 1% of children 
and young people.1,2 The natural history of the disorder 
is usually enduring and has serious eff
 ects on 
development; lifetime costs (including health, education, 
social 
care, 
family 
out-of-pocket 
expenses 
and 
productivity losses) are estimated to be between 
GB£1 million and £1·5 million in the UK and 
between US$1·4 million and $2·4 million in the USA.3 
Eff
 ective early treatment that alters the long-term course 
of the disorder would therefore have great potential 
benefi
 ts for individuals, families, and society, but has 
been diffi
  cult to demonstrate. Evidence shows that a 
range of psychosocial intervention approaches can have 
short-term eff
 ects on various developmental indicators 
that are thought to be important for later autism 
outcomes, such as parent−child joint engagement, social 
communication, child symbolic play, and social 
imitation. Follow-up data from one study showed 
improved language outcomes 5 years after the initial 
treatment endpoint.4 However, evidence is scarce as to 
whether such intermediate eff
 ects are associated with 
reduced 
autism 
symptom 
severity 
or 
improved 
longer-term post-treatment symptom outcomes.
In a Cochrane review,5 Oono and colleagues identifi
 ed 
six, 
mainly 
small, 
studies 
of 
parent-mediated 
interventions that addressed autism severity as a 
treatment outcome according to various blinded 
child assessment measures and non-blinded parent-
reported measures. A random-eff
 ects meta-analysis of 
the reported mean symptom scores suggested an overall 
eff
 ect of intervention compared with control in terms of 
reducing symptom severity (standard mean diff
 erence 
–0·30, 95% CI –0·52 to –0·08, p<0·05; combined n=316). 
Three of these studies used blinded symptom outcome

measures; these were the pilot study6 and subsequent 
larger trial7 of a 12 month pre-school autism 
communication 
intervention 
(Preschool 
Autism 
Communication Trial; PACT). In a separate meta-
analysis by the National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence (NICE),8 the weighted combined eff
 ect size of 
the treatment used in these PACT studies was –0·29 
(95% CI –0·59 to 0·00, p=0·05; n=180) in favour of the 
intervention, as assessed with a standard blinded 
measure of the social communication-specifi
 c symptoms 
of autism (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule 
[ADOS]-Generic [ADOS-G]).9 A third study also used the 
ADOS measure, and the results showed no eff
 ect on the 
symptom endpoint after 2 years of intensive treatment 
with the Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) intervention 
(n=48).10 This trial of ESDM was the basis for one of two 
longer-term follow-up studies of autism symptoms to 
have been attempted so far. ADOS assessment was done 
at a mean age of 6 years, 2 years after the end of the 
intervention.11 In individuals who were followed up, the 
investigators reported signifi
 cantly greater symptom 
reduction in intervention participants (n=21) than in 
regular care participants (n=18), although inferences 
from these fi
 ndings were limited by the small sample 
size and lack of intention-to-treat analysis. In the other 
follow-up study of autism symptoms,12 no group 
diff
 erences were found 12 months after a 12 week 
teacher-mediated intervention (n=33) compared with 
controls (n=27) in terms of non-blinded parent-rated or 
teacher-rated autism symptoms assessed with the Social 
Communication Questionnaire at age 5 years. Other 
reports of long-term follow-up after intensive behavioural 
programmes have not addressed symptoms, but have 
suggested ongoing eff
 ects on IQ and adaptive behaviour,13 
albeit on the basis of non-experimental studies14 or very 
small samples.15
In this context, the aim of our present study was to 
investigate the long-term outcomes of the largest of the 
trials done so far, PACT, which assessed the eff
 ects 
of a developmentally targeted social communication 
intervention on autism symptoms and other outcomes in 
children aged 2–4 years. The video-aided intervention in 
PACT works with the parent rather than directly with the 
child, aiming to optimise developmentally relevant 
parent interactive behaviours, which will in theory 
enhance parent–child dyadic interaction, consequently 
improving child communication and more general 
autism symptoms. The logic of this treatment procedure 
is that the dyadic interaction is the proximal target of the 
intervention and the delivery mechanism by which the 
child gains benefi
 t. The initial PACT trial tested this 
intervention against treatment as usual at three sites in a 
randomised controlled trial with two parallel arms 
(n=152).6 Trial data and associated mediation analysis16 
supported this model of the hypothesised treatment 
mechanism. A strong eff
 ect on the targeted parental 
behaviour (parental synchronous response to child com-
munication during interaction) mediated 71% of 
improvement in child communication with the parent 
during interaction. In turn, this improvement in child 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
There has been relatively little study of long-term symptom 
outcomes after autism treatment. A Cochrane review from 
2013 investigated parent-mediated intervention for young 
children with autism spectrum disorder and included 
six randomised controlled trials that reported autism symptom 
outcomes. Overall, the review showed reduced symptom 
severity with intervention compared with control conditions 
(standard mean diff
 erence –0·30, 95% CI –0·52 to –0·08, 
p<0·05; combined n=316) on random-eff
 ects meta-analysis. 
Additionally we searched for intervention trials reporting on 
longer-term symptom follow-up after parent-mediated, 
teacher-mediated, or therapist-mediated early interventions for 
young children with autism spectrum disorder. We searched 
PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and MEDLINE for articles 
published between Jan 1, 2000, and May 6, 2016, using the 
search terms “autism”, “early”, “intervention”, “long-term”, and 
“outcomes” and selecting studies that reported autism severity. 
We found two studies, one of which reported greater symptom 
reduction (assessed in a blinded manner) in participants 
followed up from the original intervention (n=21) compared 
with regular care (n=18) groups at a mean age of 6 years, two 
years after a 2 year intensive pre-school intervention. The other 
study found no eff
 ect on parent-reported or teacher-reported 
symptom questionnaires at 12 months after a 12 week 
preschool intervention (n=33) versus control (n=27). 
Added value of this study
The two previous follow-up studies to test the longer-term 
eff
 ects on symptoms after interventions for autism spectrum 
disorder in young children were marked by small sample size 
and relatively short follow-up periods. Our study contributes 
now to the scientifi
 c literature in terms of its sample size 
(n=152) and the longer-term nature of the follow-up (nearly 
6 years from treatment endpoint, with mean age of 10 years at 
follow-up) with blinded symptom ascertainment.
Implications of all the available evidence
Previous evidence from trials has suggested that early 
intervention can result in short-term symptom reduction in 
young children with autism spectrum disorder. We now show 
that a 12 month parent-mediated preschool intervention can 
produce sustained improvement in child autism symptoms and 
social communication with parents, which remained at nearly 
6 years after the end of treatment. These fi
 ndings support the 
potential long-term eff
 ects and value of early parent-mediated 
interventions for autism.

mediated 
73% 
of 
the 
independently assessed symptom change in the child in 
a diff
 erent context.
Our predefi
 ned hypotheses were that, at follow-up, we 
would fi
 nd enhanced eff
 ects of the intervention on 
the autism symptom outcome; continuation of the 
initial intervention eff
 ects on dyadic communication 
(parent synchrony, child communication initiations) and 
enhanced eff
 ects on reported adaptive functioning; 
and sustained reduction in restricted and repetitive 
behaviours of the child, accompanied by reduced anxiety, 
which has been associated with restricted and repetitive 
behaviours in some studies.17 The design of the present 
long-term follow-up of the PACT trial therefore 
combined analysis based on the initial randomised 
intervention 
allocation 
with 
prospective 
repeated 
measure follow-up to test for downstream developmental 
eff
 ects of the intervention on later autism symptoms.
Method
Study design and participants
PACT was a randomised controlled trial done at three 
specialist centres in the UK (London, Manchester, and 
Newcastle).6 The PACT trial and follow-up study were 
approved by the Central Manchester Multicentre 
Research Ethics Committee (Manchester, UK). Written 
consent to participate was provided by at least one 
parent in each family enrolled in the study. The protocol 
for this study is available in the appendix.
Children aged from 2 years to 4 years and 11 months 
were recruited if they met the criteria for so-called core 
autism in accordance with the international standard 
diagnostic tests (social and communication domains of 
the ADOS-G,9 and two of three domains of the Autism 
Diagnostic Interview Revised [ADI-R] algorithm).18 
Exclusion criteria were children with a twin with autism, 
non-verbal age equivalent to 12 months or younger 
(Mullen scales), epilepsy requiring medication, severe 
sensory impair 
ment, or severe mental illness in a parent. 
Participating parents spoke English with their child. For 
this follow-up study, we attempted to trace all participants 
of the original trial unless they had previously withdrawn 
consent for follow-up. 
Full details of the trial design, PACT intervention 
protocol and the between-group balance in nature and 
hours of treatment as usual received have been published 
previously.6 Assessment of primary outcomes was done 
by assessors unaware of treatment allocation.
Procedures
The PACT intervention is a 1 year developmentally 
focused social communication intervention programme 
for young children that consists of 12 therapy sessions 
(each 2 h long) over 6 months, followed by monthly 
support and extension sessions for a further 6 months, 
as described previously.6 Additionally, the parents agree 
to do 20–30 min per day of planned practice activities 
with the child. The assessments at follow-up were done 
by trained assessors in the centres, with occasional home 
visits if needed by families. 
Outcomes
The primary outcomes were autism symptom severity, 
assessed with the ADOS Comparative Severity Score 
(CSS),19,20 parent−child dyadic communication, using the 
Dyadic Communication Measure for Autism (DCMA), 
and language composite scores; calculated at baseline, 
the original study endpoint, and follow-up. The updated 
ADOS CSS coding, which has been published since our 
original report, refl

Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5)-defi
 ned 
autism spectrum disorder criteria by combining social 
communication and restricted and repetitive behaviours 
(which were reported separately in the original PACT 
endpoint report)6 into an overall symptom severity score. 
This system allows for comparison across diff
 erent 
developmentally staged ADOS modules. Scores range 
from 1 to 10, where scores of 1 and 2 represent minimal-
to-no evidence of autism; 3 and 4 represent low severity; 
5–7 represent moderate severity; and 8–10 represent 
high severity. Assessor training achieved the required 
reliability as shown by intraclass correlations from 
52 double-ratings of 12 children assessed during the 
main trial and 50 ratings of 25 children assessed at 
follow-up of 0·73 (95% CI 0·58 to 0·84). The severity 
scales can also be calculated for the two component 
symptom domains; social-aff
 ect (SA) and restricted and 
repetitive behaviours (RRB).9
Parent–child dyadic communication was assessed via 
measurement of an 8-min video sample of carer–child 
naturalistic play, using the DCMA.6,21 This measurement 
was obtained in a context independent of the context of 
therapy, with separate protocol and play materials to 
avoid circularity with the therapy process itself. Research 
assessors were blind to treatment allocation. Interactions 
were coded as child communication initiation with the 
parent, calculated as a proportion of all child acts, logit-
transformed for normality; parental synchronous 
response with child, calculated as the logit-transformed 
proportion of all parent acts; and conversational turns 
(follow-up only) between parent and child, as a log-
transformed number of turns during a session. Child 
and parent variables are defi
 ned independently from 
each other. Assessor training achieved the required 
reliability as shown by intraclass-correlations from 
22 double-ratings of 0·80 (95% CI 0·63 to 0·93), 0·76 
(0·61 to 0·91), and 0·90 (0·63 to 0·98) respectively. 
Child language was assessed with a composite from 
six indicators; four subscales of the Child Evaluation of 
Language Fundamentals (CELF-4) tests22 and expressive 
and receptive language raw scores from the one-word test.23

Other secondary outcomes were assessed by parents in 
a non-blinded manner. Autism symptoms were assessed 
by the parent with the Social Communication Question-
naire (SCQ).25 Restricted and repetitive behaviours, 
which consist of sensory and motor behaviours and 
insistence on sameness or circumscribed interests, were 
scored with the Repetitive Behaviour Questionnaire 
(RBQ).26 Social diffi
  culties were assessed with the 
pro-social and peer problems fi
 ve-item subscales of the 
Strength and Diffi
  culties Questionnaire (SDQ),27 and 
adaptive behaviour outcomes were assessed with 
parent-rated Vineland ABC standard score.24 Comorbid 
psychopathology was recorded as bands defi
 ned by the 
Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA)28 
indicating the risk of four common co-occurring 
disorders (depression, conduct or oppositional disorders, 
hyperkinesis, and anxiety or obsessive compulsive 
disorder [OCD]) or groups of disorders as classifi
 ed by 
the International Statistical Classifi
 cation of Diseases 
and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10). 
Data for parent-reported outcomes were collected by 
interview, online, and post via stamped-addressed 
envelopes.
Statistical analysis
Departures from the analysis plan are declared in the 
Methods section and in the statistical analysis plan in 
the appendix. We present descriptive statistics for 
participants with data at follow-up. We used logistic 
regression to identify baseline characteristics associated 
with dropout and measures for which treatment groups 
were not balanced at follow-up. Analysis of all outcomes 
followed intention-to-treat principles. We estimated 
diff
 erences between the intervention groups at the 
mean follow-up age for the whole sample, under the 
assumption of attrition being at random, by the use of 
the maximum-likelihood method, adjusting for centre 
and variables for which groups were not balanced at 
endpoint or follow-up. We checked these estimates 
against whole-sample analyses in which missing 
observations were completed by multiple imputation 
using chained equations (mi command in Stata). Where 
available, we included repeated measures in mixed-
eff
 ects models to improve the effi
  ciency of estimation of 
group diff
 erences at follow-up, to provide additional 
eff
 ect estimates at earlier time points, to increase the 
likely validity of the missing-at-random assumption, 
and to allow calculation of the area-under-the-curve 
(AUC) treatment eff
 ect estimates. We modelled the 
eff
 ects of time by piecewise slopes between each 
assessment for each treatment group, with the AUC 
calculated as the sum of the triangular or trapezoidal 
areas between the groups. These AUC eff
 ect estimates 
provide a principled basis for an overall mean eff
 ect for 
unequally spaced measures that summarise treatment 
eff
 ect over the whole trial from baseline to follow-up. 
AUC eff
 ect estimates were obtained by use of the lincom 
post-estimation command.
Of the blinded outcomes, we analysed the ADOS CSS 
with mixed-eff
 ect ordinal logistic regression (xtologit) 
with random intercept and robust standard errors. To 
make the subject-specifi
 c model log-odds ratio estimates 
more interpretable, we report the coeffi
  cients after the 
rescaling 
to 
the 
smaller 
approximate 
marginal 
(population-average) log-odds ratios.29 The treatment 
eff
 ect proportional-odds assumption was checked.30 
Planned secondary analysis tested the contribution of 
social communication and repetitive behaviour symptom 
domains to the overall eff
 ect.
We normalised the DCMA interaction measures with 
an empirical logit transformation and analysed them

with mixed-eff
 ects regression with random intercept 
(xtmixed). We used a structural equation model 
(described in the appendix) to estimate the group 
diff
 erence in the mean of a factor defi
 ned by each of the 
six language scores (sem). Of the non-blinded outcomes, 
the parent Vineland ABC scores were also analysed with 
a mixed-eff
 ects model. Because they lacked baseline 
measurement, we analysed the teacher Vineland ABC, 
SCQ, and RBQ scores by simple regression, and the 
DAWBA risk bands and SDQ peer problems and 
prosocial subscales by ordinal logistic regression. 
Cohen’s d eff
 ect size estimates used the pooled baseline 
standard deviation, or if unavailable the standard 
deviation at outcome conditional on treatment. All 
confi
 dence intervals are 2·5% and 97·5% percentiles 
from 1000 bootstrap samples (with replacement).
Statistical analyses were done by AP and GV using 
Stata version 13. Further details of the statistical analyses 
are available in the appendix. PACT is registered with 
the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN58133827
.
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of 
the report. AP and JG had full access to all the data in the 
study and had fi
 nal responsibility for the decision to 
submit for publication.
Results
152 participants were initially recruited into PACT 
between 
September, 
2006, 
and 
February, 
2008. 
77 participants were assigned to the PACT intervention 
and 75 were assigned to treatment as usual. Figure 1 
shows the fl
 ow of participants through the trial and follow-
up. We were able to trace 144 (95%) of 152 participants, 126 
(88%) of whom consented to participate in the current 
study. Of those randomly assigned, the follow-up ADOS 
assessment was completed for 59 (77%) of 77 participants 
assigned to the PACT intervention group and 62 (83%) of 
75 participants in the treatment as usual group. At follow-
up, 43 participants were assessed with module 1 of ADOS, 
22 were assessed with module 2, and 56 were assessed 
with module 3. The median length of follow-up (baseline 
to follow-up) was 82 months (IQR 78–85), with median 
time from treatment endpoint to follow-up of 69 months 
(65–71). The mean age of participants at follow-up was 
10·5 years (SD 0·8). Table 1 shows descriptive statistics by 
intervention group at baseline (all complete) and follow-
up. The 31 participants lost to follow-up (six during the 
trial and 25 during follow-up) had no signifi
 cant 
associations with treatment group, centre, autism severity, 
level of adaptive functioning, or any of the demographic 
measures shown in table 1. In individuals with follow-up 
data, participants in the PACT intervention group were 
more likely to be boys (p=0·05), from two-parent 
households (p=0·02), and to have parents with higher 
education (p=0·001) at baseline.
Table 2 shows descriptive data by treatment group for 
the follow-up outcomes. Figure 2 shows eff
 ect estimates 
(both log-odds ratio and Cohen’s d) after adjustment for 
the measures in table 1 that were unbalanced. Very 
similar estimates were obtained with multiple imputed 
outcomes (appendix). The descriptive statistics (table 2) 
and eff
 ect estimates (fi
 gure 2) show that, at the original 
treatment endpoint, the intention-to-treat estimate of 
autism symptom severity measured with ADOS CSS 
showed a larger reduction (marginal log-odds eff
 ect size 
[ES] 0·64, 95% CI 0·07 to 1·20) than that previously 
reported with the social communication algorithm score 
alone (Cohen’s d ES of 0·24, 95% CI –0·59 to 0·11, in 
favour of PACT),6 with no evidence of eff
 ects varying with 
severity (proportional-odds test p=0·23). This estimate 
corresponded to an endpoint diff
 erence in the proportion 
of high severity CSS symptom scores in each group (44% 
in the treatment as usual group and 29% in the PACT 
intervention group) and represented a diff
 erence in 
favour of the PACT intervention of 15·4% (95% bootstrap 
CI 1·2 to 29·7) for intervention versus treatment as usual. 
At follow-up, the point estimate of ADOS CSS showed a 
continuing group diff
 erence in symptoms, but with a CI 
that included the null (marginal log-odds ES 0·70, 
95% CI –0·05 to 1·47).   Again, there was no evidence of 
eff
 ects varying with severity (proportional-odds test

p=0·154). The proportion of high severity symptom 
scores in each group had increased (63% in the treatment 
as usual group and 46% in the PACT intervention group); 
a group diff
 erence of 17·2% (95% CI –2·9 to 37·3) in 
favour of intervention versus treatment as usual. Figure 3 
shows the course of autism symptoms by group from 
baseline to trial endpoint, and then to follow-up. The 
combined mean treatment eff
 ects on symptom severity, 
as estimated from the AUC, showed signifi
 cantly lower 
severity scores in the PACT intervention group compared 
with the treatment as usual group (marginal log-odds 
ES 0·55, 95% CI 0·14 to 0·91; p=0·009). Secondary 
analysis (appendix) showed that changes in the social 
communication and restricted and repetitive behaviour 
symptom domains had contributed to this overall eff
 ect.
Figure 3 also shows the pattern for child dyadic 
communication initiation. The group diff
 erence at follow-
up (Cohen’s d ES 0·29, 95% CI –0·02 to 0·57) was smaller 
than at endpoint (ES 0·44, 95% CI 0·09 to 0·76), but the 
mean treatment eff
 ect over the whole trial and follow-up 
was clear (ES 0·33, 95% CI 0·1 to 0·6, p=0·004).
At follow-up we found no trace of the group diff
 erence 
in parent synchrony that was previously reported6 at the 
trial endpoint (table 2, fi
 gure 2). However, when the 
overall time period is taken into account (fi
 gure 3), the 
eff
 ects of intervention were signifi
 cant (ES 0·61, 95% CI 
0·38 to 0·86, p<0·0001). The point estimate of eff
 ect on 
teacher-rated adaptive behaviour at follow-up showed an 
ES of 0·27 (95% CI –0·07 to 0·62) for PACT treatment 
versus treatment as usual. Correlations among all six 
language indicators (see methods) exceeded 0·7 (Cronbach 
α=0·88) and gave an exploratory factor analysis with a 
dominant fi
 rst factor (eigenvalue 4·82; appendix). This 
child language outcome composite showed no evidence of 
group diff
 erence (ES 0·15, 95% CI –0·23 to 0·53).
Non-blinded parent-ratings of autism symptoms (SCQ 
and RBQ; table 2, fi
 gure 2) showed clear and substantial 
treatment eff
 ects at follow-up. Parent report of adaptive 
behaviour, peer problems and prosocial behaviour 
showed moderate to substantial point estimate trends in 
favour of treatment, but CI’s on all of these results 
included null or small negative eff
 ects. There was no 
evidence of treatment eff
 ect on co-occurring mental 
health problems on DAWBA.

a treatment eff
 ect to reduce autism symptom severity 
at treatment endpoint, which remained almost 6 years 
later, giving a clear averaged treatment eff
 ect over the 
total period. The eff
 ect was apparent across both autism 
social-communication 
and 
repetitive 
symptom 
domains. A similar treatment eff
 ect is also seen in 
parent-reported symptom measures at follow-up 
which, although unblinded, have the potential comple-
mentary strengths of being service-user outcome 
measures and being based on knowledge of the child in 
naturalistic settings.
To our knowledge, this study is the fi
 rst study to 
report long-term symptom outcomes to middle 
childhood (7–11 years) following a randomised 
controlled trial of early intervention in young children. 
As such, our results extend the fi
 ndings from the 
smaller study of Estes and colleagues, with a shorter 
follow-up period of 2 years11 that suggested follow-up 
eff
 ects on autism symptoms. Notably, the PACT 
intervention is substantially less time intensive than is 
Estes and colleagues intervention (ESDM) in terms of 
therapist treatment hours. Taken together, these results 
are encouraging and provide evidence that sustained 
changes in autism symptoms can be possible after early 
intervention, something that has previously been 
regarded as diffi
  cult to achieve.
Our fi
 ndings also have substantial implications for 
developmental science, given that a sustained eff
 ect of this 
type on targeted outcomes for a prolonged period after the 
end of treatment is very uncommon in developmental 
interventions. PACT is designed to work with parents to 
reduce autism symptoms through optimising naturalistic 
parent–child social communication in the home setting. 
The theoretical advantage of this approach over direct 
therapist–child therapy is that it has potential for change 
in the everyday life of the child, in which much social 
learning takes place, and might continue to have sustained 
eff
 ects after the end of the therapist-delivered intervention 
to the parent. Evidence from the initial trial mediation 
analysis16 supported this theoretical model of action by 
showing that it was the treatment eff
 ects on parent 
interaction style that were responsible for the positive 
child change during the treatment period. The current 
follow-up analysis shows a loss of this original treatment 
eff
 ect on parental synchrony over time, but maintenance 
of the eff
 ects on child communication and symptom-
change. This fi
 nding suggests that the improvement in 
child communication and autism symptoms during 
treatment could have become self-sustaining during the 
years following the end of treatment, independent of the 
initial parental behavioural change that mediated them. 
This fi
 nding lends support to the theoretical rationale 
behind a developmental approach in which targeting of 
pivotal precursor social communication skills can lead to 
improvements in developmental trajectories, further 
supporting the notion that a parent-mediated approach 
can lead to sustained eff
 ects beyond the end of treatment. 
Further empirical study of the mechanism behind such 
maintained change is now needed.
Before the follow-up study, we hypothesised that the 
PACT intervention would lead to sustained reduction in 
restricted and repetitive behaviours of the child. Testing of 
this hypothesis in a prespecifi
 ed analysis produced another 
important fi
 nding: the intervention, which was targeted at 
improving child social communication, also had marked 
cross-domain eff
 ects on the restricted and repetitive 
behaviours aspect of autism, seen both at endpoint6 and at 
follow-up, with the follow-up result refl
 ected in ADOS CSS 
and parent-reported RBQ scores. We argue that this 
fi
 nding supports a developmental account of the 
emergence of restricted and repetitive behaviours as at 
least partly dependent on a lack of eff
 ective social 
communication during the development of individuals 
with autism. However, our related hypothesis that levels of 
child anxiety, which are often linked to levels of restricted 
and repetitive behaviours in autism,17 would also show a 
treatment eff
 ect at follow-up was refuted (fi
 gure 2).
Amelioration of the defi
 ning symptoms of autism is 
positive in its own right; but, in longitudinal autism 
cohort studies, ADOS symptom trajectories also predict

concurrent adaptive functioning and later long-range 
adjustment through to young adulthood.31,32 Estes and 
colleagues reported an eff
 ect on parent-rated adaptive 
function during their 2 year follow-up.11 Our measures 
designed to address this aspect of autism were blinded 
teacher-rating of adaptive function in school, and 
non-blinded reports by parents of child adaptive function, 
peer relationships, and prosocial behavior. Point estimates 
of treatment eff
 ect on these measures range from modest 
to substantial size in favour of treatment, but CIs for the 
eff
 ect sizes were wide and included null or negative 
eff
 ects in each case (fi
 gure 2). Consequently we cannot be 
sure at this time of the existence or extent of the eff
 ect of 
symptom changes on general adaptation. We found no 
evidence of an overall eff
 ect on comorbid mental health 
problems; the only apparent eff
 ect, a small point estimate 
of eff
 ect on anxiety or OCD symptoms, had a wide CI that 
included both some negative and positive eff
 ect. These 
fi
 ndings suggest that, at the least, additional strategies 
will be needed if broader adaptive function and mental 
health in autism at later ages is to be further improved.
The high rate of follow-up of what was already the 
largest randomised intervention cohort of its kind to 
address core autism features represents a key strength of 
this study; follow-up ascertainment was achieved for 
almost 80% of the recruited sample at 82 months after 
initial randomisation. Key measures were assessed in a 
blinded manner and consistently across time-points, 
although parent reports of repetitive behaviours and peer 
functioning were at follow-up only. Between-group 
demographic imbalances in the follow-up sample were 
adjusted for in the analysis. We note that our inclusion 
criteria were for core-defi
 ned autism rather than broader 
autism spectrum disorder; we cannot be sure how our 
results would generalise to young children with less 
severe symptoms.
This study advances previous work by showing that a 
theoretically derived, developmentally targeted early 
intervention can have a sustained eff
 ect on autism 
symptom outcomes nearly 6 years after the end of treat-
ment. In addition to replication, further research is needed 
to elucidate the developmental mechanisms behind such 
sustained change, as well as the extent of and barriers to 
wider developmental benefi
 ts, and the cost-eff
 ective 
ness of 
such interventions over longer-term development.
On the basis of these results, we are now able to 
support the use of the PACT intervention for reducing 
symptoms of autism in young children, a revision of our 
initial view6 and consistent with the results of a 
subsequent UK NICE meta-analysis.8
