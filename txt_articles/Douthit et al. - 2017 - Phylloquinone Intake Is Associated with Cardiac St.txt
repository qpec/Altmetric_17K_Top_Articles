Abstract
Background: Associations between childhood vitamin K consumption and cardiac structure and function have not been
investigated.
Objective: We determined associations between phylloquinone (vitamin K-1) intake and left ventricular (LV) structure and
function in adolescents.
Methods: We assessed diet with three to seven 24-h recalls and physical activity (PA) by accelerometry in 766
adolescents (aged 14–18 y, 50% female, 49% black). Fat-free soft tissue (FFST) mass and fat mass were measured by
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. LV structure [LV mass (g)/height (m)2.7 (LV mass index) and relative wall thickness] and
function [midwall fractional shortening (MFS) and ejection fraction] were assessed by echocardiography. Associations
were evaluated by comparing the LV structure and function variables across tertiles of phylloquinone intake. Prevalence
and OR of LV hypertrophy (LV mass index >95th percentile for age and sex) were also assessed by phylloquinone tertiles.
Results: The prevalence of LV hypertrophy progressively decreased across tertiles of phylloquinone intake (P-trend < 0.01).
Multinomial logistic regression—adjusting for age, sex, race, Tanner stage, systolic blood pressure, FFST mass, fat mass,
socioeconomic status, PA, and intakes of energy, fiber, calcium, vitamin C, vitamin D, and sodium—revealed that
compared with the highest phylloquinone intake tertile (reference group), the adjusted OR for LV hypertrophy was 3.3
(95% CI: 1.2, 7.4) for those in the lowest phylloquinone intake tertile. When LV structure variables were compared across
phylloquinone intake tertiles adjusting for the same covariates, there were significant linear downward trends for LV mass
index (6.5% difference, tertile 1 compared with tertile 3) and relative wall thickness (9.2% difference, tertile 1 compared
with tertile 3; both P-trend # 0.02). Conversely, significant linear upward trends across phylloquinone intake tertiles were
observed for MFS (3.4% difference, tertile 1 compared with tertile 3) and ejection fraction (2.6% difference, tertile
1 compared with tertile 3; both P-trend < 0.04).
Conclusion: Our adolescent data suggest that subclinical cardiac structure and function variables are most favorable at
higher phylloquinone intakes.

Introduction
Cardiac structural and functional abnormalities, including
left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, have been shown to be
independent predictors of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events
and mortality (1–4). Evidence suggests that cardiac structure
and function abnormalities begin in childhood (5, 6), increasing
the likelihood of CVD events in adulthood (7). Therefore,
identifying key contributors to abnormalities in cardiac struc-
ture and function in childhood has wide-reaching implications

 for public health, particularly because CVD accounts for
approximately one-third of all deaths in the United States (8).
Dietary factors are important to consider because they can be
modified, making them one of the main targets for interventions
aimed at the prevention of CVD.
Recently, there has been growing interest in vitamin K, a
fat-soluble vitamin, as a beneficial nutrient in cardiovascular
health. In nature, vitamin K is present in the diet in the forms of
phylloquinone (vitamin K-1) and menaquinones (vitamin K-2).
Phylloquinone, the major dietary source of vitamin K, is found
primarily in dark-green leafy vegetables and certain plant oils and
is the vitamin K form best characterized in US food composition
databases (9, 10). It is postulated from animal studies that
increased phylloquinone intake may reduce the progression of
CVD, possibly by means of counteracting vascular calcification in
the arteries and by regulating lipoprotein metabolism (11, 12).
However, the clinical evidence for the link between phylloquinone
intake and CVD is scant and equivocal. For instance, some reports
have found greater phylloquinone consumption linked to lower
TGs (13), higher HDL-cholesterol (14), lower CVD risk (15, 16),
and less deposition of calcified lesions in the aorta (17). In
contrast, others have reported no association between phylloqui-
none intake and CVD risk or markers of CVD risk (18–22).
The discrepancies in the aforementioned dietary phylloquinone–
CVD investigations can be partly attributed to differences in the
populations studied and the study designs and instruments used.
However, another notable limitation of these investigations was
that all study participants were adults. Because cardiac structural
and functional abnormalities have been shown to track during
childhood and later life (23, 24) and may be affected by dietary
intake (25, 26), it is of interest to examine relations between
phylloquinone intake and cardiac structure and function in the
pediatric population. Therefore, the objective of this study was
to determine associations between phylloquinone intake and
subclinical parameters of LV structure and function in an appar-
ently healthy adolescent population living in the southeastern
United States.
Methods
Participants. The participants in this study were 766 adolescents who
were recruited from local high schools in the Augusta, Georgia area.
With approval from superintendents and school principals, flyers were
distributed to all students in the high schools. Inclusion criteria for the
study were white/Caucasian or black/African-American race and age
14–18 y. Adolescents were excluded if they were taking medications or
had any medical conditions that could affect growth, maturation, physical
activity, nutritional status, or metabolism. Informed consent and assent
were obtained from all parents and adolescents, respectively. The study
protocol was approved by the Augusta University Institutional Review
Board. All measurements were performed at the Medical College of
Georgia�s Georgia Prevention Institute at Augusta University between
2001 and 2005.
Anthropometry, blood pressure, pubertal stage, and socioeconomic
status. A trained laboratory technician collected height and weight
measurements for calculating sex- and age-specific BMI percentiles (27).
Seated blood pressure was measured 5 times at 1-min intervals after a
10-min rest using the Dinamap Pro 100 (Critikon Corporation), and the
last 3 measures were averaged. Pubertal maturation stage (or Tanner
stage) was measured with a 5-stage scale, ranging from I (prepubertal) to
V (fully mature) as described by Tanner (28). Using this sex-specific
questionnaire, participants reported their pubertal stage by comparing
their own physical development to the 5 stages in standard sets of
diagrams. A parent or research coordinator then reviewed the results
with the children to make sure they understood the questionnaire. When
an individual reported discordant stages of pubic hair and breast or
genital development, the higher of the 2 stages was used. The
socioeconomic status was assessed using the Hollingshead 4-factor
index of social class (29), which combines the educational attainment
and occupational prestige for the number of working parents in the
child�s family. Scores ranged from 11 to 51, with higher scores indicating
higher theoretical socioeconomic status.
Body composition. Fat-free soft tissue (FFST) mass and fat mass
were assessed by DXA (QDR-4500W; Hologic Inc.). For determination
of measurement reproducibility, 1-factor random-effects model, single-
measure intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated in partici-
pants aged 15–18 y (n = 219). Each participant was scanned twice
within a 7-d period for FFST mass and fat mass (both r $ 0.97).
LV structure and function. LV structure and function variables were
assessed by 2-dimensionally directed M-mode echocardiography (Hewlett-
Packard Sonos 1500; Hewlett-Packard) by experienced sonographers
using a standard institutional protocol in the Georgia Prevention Insti-
tute�s Echocardiography Laboratory (30). Measurements of LV structure
included the following variables: LV mass index, relative wall thickness,
interventricular septal wall thickness in diastole (SWTd), LV posterior
wall thickness in diastole (PWTd), LV internal diameter in diastole
(LVIDd), LV internal diameter in systole (LVIDs), end-diastolic volume
(EDV), and end-systolic volume (ESV). SWTd, PWTd, LVIDd, and
LVIDs were measured by American Society of Echocardiography
guidelines (31). LV mass was calculated by using the following equa-
tion (32):
LV mass ¼ 0:08 3
�
1:04½ðLVIDd þ PWTd þ SWTdÞ
3
2ðLVIDdÞ
3�
�
þ 0:6 g
ð1Þ
To minimize the effects of differences in body size of children and
adolescents, LV mass needs to be adjusted relative to body size (33).
Hence, LV mass was indexed to body height raised to the power of 2.7
(LV mass index), as recommended by de Simone et al. (34). LV
hypertrophy was defined as LV mass index >95th percentile for age and
sex (35). Relative wall thickness was calculated using the equation:
relative wall thickness ¼ 2 3 PWTd O LVIDd
ð2Þ
The LV volumes, EDV and ESV, were estimated from end-diastolic and
end-systolic dimensions, respectively (36).
Measurements of LV systolic function included the following
variables: endocardial fractional shortening (EFS), midwall fractional
shortening (MFS), and ejection fraction. EFS, defined as [(LVIDd 2
LVIDs) O LVIDd)] 3 100, was calculated according to Lutas et al. (37).
MFS was calculated using the following equation reported by de Simone
et al. (38):
MFS ¼ ½ðLVIDd þ SWTd O 2 þ PWTd O 2Þ 2 ðLVIDs þ Hs O 2Þ�
ðLVId þ SWTd O 2 þ PWTd O 2Þ 3 100
ð3Þ
In Equation 3, Hs/2 is the LV inner shell myocardial thickness at end
systole, taking into account the epicardial migration of the midwall
during systole in a spherical model. Ejection fraction was calculated by
using the following equation:
ejection fraction ¼ ½ðEDV 2 ESVÞ O EDV� 3 100
ð4Þ
Physical activity. The mean daily minutes spent in moderate and
vigorous physical activity (PA) was assessed using MTI Actigraph
monitors (model 7164; MTI Health Services). Subjects were instructed
to wear the monitor for 7 d, remove it for sleep and any activity that may
cause harm to the monitor or another person (e.g., during contact
sports), and return the monitor 1 wk later. Data from day 1 and day 7
were discarded because a full day of information was not available for
those days. Daily movement counts were converted to average minutes

 per day spent in moderate PA (3–6 metabolic equivalents) and vigorous
PA (>6 metabolic equivalents) by the software accompanying the device.
Dietary intake. To assess mean daily intakes of energy, protein,
carbohydrate, fat, fiber, calcium, vitamin C, vitamin D, sodium, and
vitamin K-1 (measured as phylloquinone), a trained registered dietitian
conducted three to seven 24-h diet recalls (including 1 weekend day)
using a multiple-pass, computer-assisted interview approach [Nutrition
Data System for Research (NDS-R), Nutrition Coordinating Center,
University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota]. A total of 3 to 7 d of
dietary information was collected in 3.3%, 8.7%, 17.2%, 18.4%, and
50.2% of the adolescents, respectively. Of the adolescents in our study,
98% (n = 750) and 95% (n = 725) completed $3- and 4-d dietary recalls,
respectively. The first 2 recalls were performed in person at our institute
with the use of food models, portion booklets, or serving containers to
assist in estimating serving size, and the remaining interviews were
conducted by telephone, with all 7 recalls completed within a 12-wk
period. Participants were not interviewed on days when they had been
ill or days that fell on a major holiday. To minimize the potential
for undereating during the time frame for 24-h recalls, participants were
blinded to the telephone recall schedule. A trained research assistant coded
and analyzed dietary intake data using the NDS-R software version 2006.
Statistical analysis. We examined the phylloquinone–cardiac structure
and
function
association
by
comparing
the
LV
structure
and
systolic function variables across tertile groups of phylloquinone
intake. Phylloquinone intake values reported within each group are
medians (range). Linear trends across tertile groups were tested by
ANOVA with polynomial contrast for continuous variables (i.e., age,
Tanner stage, blood pressure, BMI percentile, body composition,
socioeconomic status, physical activity, and dietary intake variables)
and by Mantel-Haenszel linear-by-linear association x2 tests for categoric
variables (i.e., sex, race, and LV hypertrophy). Descriptive statistics for the
raw variables are presented as means 6 SDs if not stated otherwise.
For comparison of the dependent variables (i.e., LV mass index,
relative wall thickness, SWTd, PWTd, LVIDd, LVIDs, EDV, ESV, EFS,
MFS, and ejection fraction), an F test was performed to test the
assumption of homogeneity of regression slopes for the interactions
between the independent variable (i.e., phylloquinone intake tertile
groups) and the covariates (age, sex, race, Tanner stage, systolic blood
pressure, FFST mass, fat mass, socioeconomic status, moderate and
vigorous PA, and dietary intakes of total energy, fiber, calcium, vitamin
C, vitamin D, and sodium). These covariates were chosen based on
factors related to cardiovascular allometry (39, 40) and the established
influence of lifestyle and dietary factors on cardiovascular health (41,
42). Because there were no interactions, ANCOVA with polynomial
contrast was used to compare the dependent variables across tertile
groups of phylloquinone intake after adjusting for the covariates. If the
trend for difference in the dependent variable of interest across a tertile of
phylloquinone intake was significant (P < 0.05), differences between
individual tertiles, adjusted for multiple comparisons, were tested by
using Tukey�s honestly significant difference adjustment. Multinomial
logistic regression was used to estimate ORs and 95% CIs for the
probability of LV hypertrophy according to tertiles of phylloquinone
intake after adjusting for the same covariates. All statistical analyses
were conducted with SAS version 9.4 software (SAS Institute), and
statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.
Results
The sample was composed of 766 white and black adolescents
aged 14–18 y (50% female, 49% black). Most of the adolescents
(91.7%) reported to be in pubertal stages IV and V; however, 55

 were in pubertal stage III and 8 in stage II. Most of the females
(96.5%) reported having started menstruation. In the total
sample, mean dietary intake of phylloquinone was 64.5 mg/d
(range: 8–386 mg/d), and 24.8% met the Adequate Intake (AI;
75 mg/d for males and females aged 14–18 y) for phylloquinone (10).
In addition, the overall prevalence of LV hypertrophy was 9.6%.
Participant characteristics by tertile categories of phylloqui-
none intake are described in Table 1. Age, race, Tanner stage,
blood pressure, BMI percentile, socioeconomic status, moder-
ate and vigorous PA, and intakes of macronutrients, calcium,
vitamin C, vitamin D, and sodium did not differ between
groups. However, significant linear upward trends in levels of
FFST mass and intakes of energy and fiber were found across
tertiles of phylloquinone intake (all P-trend # 0.02). Significant
linear downward trends across tertiles of phylloquinone intake
were observed with sex distribution and levels of fat mass (both
P-trend # 0.02). In addition, the prevalence of LV hypertrophy
progressively decreased across tertiles of phylloquinone intake
(17% compared with 8% compared with 5%; P-trend < 0.01).
After adjustment for age, sex, race, Tanner stage, systolic blood
pressure, FFST mass, fat mass, socioeconomic status, moderate
and vigorous PA, and dietary intakes of total energy, fiber,
calcium, vitamin C, vitamin D, and sodium, multinomial logistic
regression revealed that compared with the highest phylloqui-
none intake tertile (reference group), the adjusted OR for LV
hypertrophy was 3.3 (95% CI: 1.2, 7.4) for those in the lowest
phylloquinone intake tertile (Figure 1).
Figures 2 and 3 display measures of LV structure and LV

intake when we adjusted for age, sex, race, Tanner stage,

energy, fiber, calcium, vitamin C, vitamin D, and sodium. There
were significant linear downward trends for LV mass index
(6.5% difference, tertile 1 compared with tertile 3), relative

ejection fraction (2.6% difference, tertile 1 compared with
tertile 3; both P-trend < 0.04; Supplemental Table 2, Figure 3).
There were no differences in LVIDd or EFS across tertiles of
phylloquinone intake (both P-trend > 0.05)
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate
associations of vitamin K intake with cardiac structure and function
in a pediatric population. We found that greater phylloquinone
consumption in adolescents was associated with multiple
indicators of LV structure and function. These associations
were independent of potentially confounding factors such as
age, sex, race, pubertal stage, blood pressure, body compo-
sition, physical activity, and other factors of dietary intake.
Our study findings in adolescents suggest that greater phyl-
loquinone consumption may favorably influence subclinical
parameters of cardiac structure and function implicated in
CVD risk.
To date, there are no published data in children or adolescents
on relations between vitamin K intake and LV structure and
function or any other CVD-related outcomes. Findings from
adult studies do suggest the importance of vitamin K intake
on cardiovascular health; however, results have been incon-
sistent (13–22). In the Framingham Offspring Cohort Study
(13), researchers found that higher phylloquinone intake was
associated with higher HDL-cholesterol and lower TGs reflect-
ing a blood lipid profile indicative of lower CVD risk. Data from
NHANES 1999–2004 also revealed a direct relation between
phylloquinone intake and HDL-cholesterol (14). Investigators in
another study suggested that vitamin K intake might be linked to
the development of atherosclerosis, because they found that
phylloquinone intakes were significantly lower in postmeno-
pausal women with aortic calcifications than in those without
aortic calcifications (17). In the Nurses� Health Study, re-
searchers reported that a higher phylloquinone intake was
associated with a lower risk of coronary artery disease (15).
However, other population-based studies found no cardiopro-
tective effect of phylloquinone intake. In 4807 Dutch men and
women (mean age: 67 y; 38% men) from the Rotterdam Study
(20) and 807 US Army personnel (mean age: 42 y; 82% men)
from the Prospective Army Coronary Calcium study (18), there
were no associations of phylloquinone intake with risk of
coronary artery disease or the presence of coronary artery
calcification, respectively. Likewise, in 1689 Dutch postmeno-
pausal women (mean age: 57 y) participating in the Predictors of
Response to Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy study (19), the
prevalence of breast artery calcifications did not differ across
quartiles of phylloquinone intake.
Although the disparate findings from the adult investigations
may result from differences in study designs and populations

on cardiovascular health. For instance, menaquinone-4 and
menaquinone-7 are 2 subtypes of vitamin K-2 that have been
postulated to be more effective in improving cardiovascular
health than phylloquinone (43). Two population-based studies
that compared vitamin K-1 and vitamin K-2 found that higher
intakes of vitamin K-2 but not K-1 were associated with lower
coronary artery disease risk (20, 22), with Gast et al. (22)
showing that menaquinone-7 accounted in large part for the
protective effect of vitamin K-2. Furthermore, in a study of 564
postmenopausal women, Beulens et al. (21) reported that higher
intake of vitamin K-2, attributed mostly to menaquinone-4, was
associated with lower coronary calcification, whereas vitamin
K-1 was not. Our study was limited to assessment of phylloqui-
none. Dietary intakes of menaquinone-4 and menaquonine-7,
which have a bacterial origin found primarily in animal meats
and fermented foods, were not measured in our study. Thus,
total vitamin K intake may have been underestimated, even
though phylloquinone is the predominant vitamin K form
in the US diet (9) and can be endogenously converted to
menaquinone-4 (44).
In adult investigations, LV structure and systolic function
measurements, including LV mass index, relative wall thickness,
MFS, and ejection fraction, have been associated with subse-
quent CVD (1–4). Because cardiac structural and functional
abnormalities have been shown to track during childhood and
later life (23, 24) and may be affected by dietary intake (25, 26),
it is of clinical relevance to study dietary determinants of cardiac
structures and function. In our study, LV mass index and relative
wall thickness were significantly greater (6.5% and 9.2%,
respectively) and MFS and ejection fraction were significantly
lower (3.4% and 2.6%, respectively) in the lowest than in the
highest tertile of phylloquinone intake. The magnitude of
difference in these subclinical risk markers of CVD between
tertiles 1 and 3 was statistically significant but was relatively
small and may not reflect clinically relevant differences. More-
over, the effect of small cardiovascular developmental differ-
ences on health in later life is largely unknown. Prospective
studies with follow-up in adulthood will be needed to address
these questions. Nevertheless, the present study expands our
knowledge of adolescent phylloquinone consumption and CVD.
Without an estimated average requirement value, our study
could not estimate the prevalence of inadequacy of vitamin K
intake. However, only 25% of the adolescents met AI values for
phylloquinone intake and thus had a high probability of having
AI, whereas the proportion with inadequate intakes is less
certain. Another important finding in our study is that adoles-
cents who consumed #42 mg phylloquinone/d were 3.3 times
more likely to have LV hypertrophy than those who consumed
$90 mg phylloquinone/d. The biological basis by which a low
or inadequate intake of phylloquinone may adversely influ-
ence cardiac structure and function or cardiovascular health in
general remains to be determined. The vitamin K–cardiovascular
health relation is linked through vascular calcification, a key
factor in the development of LV hypertrophy that has been
shown to alter the pulsatile dynamics and thereby contribute to
an increase in LV load (45–47). Several vitamin K–dependent
proteins (VKDPs) have been implicated in the vascular calcifi-
cation process. For instance, it has been postulated that matrix
Gla protein activated via vitamin K–dependent g-carboxylation
counteracts vascular calcification in arteries (48–51), whereas
inactive matrix Gla protein, seen in cases of vitamin K
insufficiency, has been associated with intimal and medial
calcification (11, 52). Dhore et al. (53) reported that osteocalcin,
another VKDP, was expressed in arteries at all stages of
atherosclerosis development, acting as a calcification inhibi-
tor. Gla-rich protein, a recently discovered VKDP (54), and
growth arrest-specific gene 6 protein have also been shown to
have roles in vascular calcification (55–57). Collectively, the
biological function of vitamin K appears to extend to VKDPs
involved in vascular disease. Whether increasing intake of
vitamin K, via diet or supplementation, might be able to
counteract or attenuate vascular disease progression remains
to be determined.
The present study has several strengths. First, the collection
of 3–7 independent 24-h recalls over a 12-wk period provided a
more accurate dietary assessment of phylloquinone intake com-
pared with fewer recalls used in other epidemiologic studies (14,
58), which reduces bias from measurement error and random
error due to within-person variability over time. Second, we
had a relatively large, apparently healthy adolescent population
with nearly equal distributions of males and females and whites
and blacks. Another strength is the consideration of potential
confounding variables in our analyses with phylloquinone
intake.
However, we acknowledge several study limitations. Given
that our study used cross-sectional data, we cannot be certain
that phylloquinone intake has a direct effect on cardiac struc-
ture and function. Also, the absence of circulating vitamin K
biomarkers precludes us from assessing whether a better vitamin
K status reflected by a higher intake of phylloquinone would
have a beneficial effect on cardiac structure and function. Last,
our study findings are limited to adolescents living in the
southeastern United States; thus, differences in socioeconomic
status, geographic location, social environment, lifestyle, or food
habits of the study population may preclude generalizability of
the study findings. However, given that the mean phylloquinone
consumption (65 mg/d) in our sample is comparable to the most
recent national average in 12- to 19-y-olds (74 mg/d) (58), our
findings are likely generalizable to many other settings.
In conclusion, our data suggest that greater phylloquinone
consumption may favorably influence subclinical markers of
cardiac structure and function in a population of US adolescents.
Additional pediatric investigations are needed to clarify the
importance of phylloquinone intake to cardiovascular develop-
ment and to understand the role of VKDP as the biological basis
for the phylloquinone–cardiovascular health relation. This could
eventually lead to phylloquinone interventions in childhood
aimed to improve cardiovascular development and to reduce the
subsequent risk of CVD.
