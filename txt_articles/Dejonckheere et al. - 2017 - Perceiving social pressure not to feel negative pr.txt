Abstract 
Background – Western societies often overemphasize the pursuit of happiness, and regard 
negative feelings like sadness or anxiety as maladaptive and unwanted. Despite this emphasis 
on happiness, the amount of people suffering from depressive complaints is remarkably high. 
To explain this apparent paradox, we examined whether experiencing social pressure not to feel 
sad or anxious could in fact contribute to depressive symptoms.  
Methods – A sample of individuals (n = 112) with elevated depression scores (PHQ-9 ≥ 10) 
took part in an online daily diary study in which they rated their depressive symptoms and 
perceived social pressure not to feel depressed or anxious for 30 consecutive days. Using 
multilevel VAR models we investigated the temporal relation between this perceived social 
pressure and depressive symptoms in order to determine directionality.  
Results – Primary analyses consistently indicated that experiencing social pressure predicts 
increases in both overall severity scores and most individual symptoms of depression, but not 
vice versa. A set of secondary analyses, in which we adopted a network perspective on 
depression, confirmed these findings. Using this approach, centrality analysis revealed that 
perceived social pressure not to feel negative plays an instigating role in depression, reflected 
by the high out- and low instrength centrality of this pressure in the various depression 
networks.  
Conclusions – Together, these findings indicate how perceived societal norms may contribute 
to depression, hinting at a possible malignant consequence of society’s denouncement of 
negative emotions. Clinical implications are discussed.

Introduction 
Prevalence rates of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in Western societies are remarkably 
high. With epidemiological estimates having doubled in the last 3 decades (Compton et al., 
2006), today one in six Americans will suffer from depression at some point in their lives 
(Kessler et al., 2012), making it a leading cause of disability in modern ‘first-world’ societies 
(Ferrari et al., 2013). Beside the emotional and psychological distress for patients and their 
immediate social environment (e.g. reduced quality of life, social dysfunction; Lépine & Briley, 
2011), MDD leaves the broader society with an extensive economic burden (Greenberg et al., 
2015), pushing researchers to discover the mechanisms underlying this debilitating disorder. 
 
At the same time – and almost paradoxically – society seems to be exceedingly 
preoccupied with happiness (Bastian et al., 2012; Sheldon & Lyubomirsky, 2006). Particularly 
in Western countries where MDD prevalence rates are especially high (e.g. Weissman et al., 
1996), today’s societal norm encourages people to pursue happiness (Bastian et al., 2012; 
2015a), ranging from brand commercials emphasizing the hedonic pleasure of consumption 
(e.g. Lewis & Hill, 1998), to national indexes carefully monitoring citizen’s well-being and life 
satisfaction (e.g. Diener, 2000). Simultaneously, negative emotions like sadness and anxiety 
commonly receive a maladaptive and dysfunctional connotation (Haslam, 2005), with the 
adaptive nature of feeling negative at times, such as regulating social interaction (Fischer & 
Manstead, 2008; McNulty, 2010) and contributing to a meaningful life (Hayes et al., 1999), 
hardly being mentioned in modern societal discourse (Bastian et al., 2012). 
 
Although emphasizing happiness might seem laudable for people’s well-being, recent 
studies also point to detrimental consequences of the pressure to feel happy and not sad. Lab 
results indicate that participants who are experimentally induced to value happiness react less 
 DEJONCKHEERE – social pressure not to feel bad in depression

positively to happy emotion induction (Mauss et al., 2011). Conversely, perceiving societal 
pressure not to experience or express negative emotions is associated with higher levels of 
negative affect and reduced well-being, a finding that was found to be particularly strong in 
Western societies (Bastian et al., 2012). Such perceived pressure has moreover been related to 
loneliness (Bastian et al., 2015a) and to biased attention for negative information (Bastian et 
al., 2015b). The underlying idea is that perceiving high pressure not to experience negative 
emotion creates a discrepancy between one’s actual emotional state and the social standard 
deemed desirable when an individual inevitably feels sad or anxious, leading to negative self-
reflections and an ironic amplification of these unwanted emotions (e.g. Carver & Scheier, 
1990; Nolen-hoeksema, 1991). 
 
Could it be that the high premium society places on happiness may paradoxically 
contribute to the prevalence of depression and its symptoms? Preliminary experimental 
evidence shows that communicating that public opinion disapproves of the experience of 
negative emotions leads to a temporary augmentation of negative affect (Bastian et al., 2012). 
Yet whether these social expectancies play a role in depressive symptoms in the complexity of 
everyday life remains unexplored. 
 
In the present study, we sought to examine the role of the perceived pressure not to 
experience negative emotions in the occurrence of depressive symptoms in real life. In 
particular, we examined whether the perceived pressure not to feel sad or anxious predicts 
depressive symptoms from one day to another in a group of individuals with elevated depression 
scores. Participants who exhibited depressive complaints were preselected from a larger initial 
pool. They next participated in a daily diary study in which they reported their depressive 
 DEJONCKHEERE – social pressure not to feel bad in depression  
5 
 
symptoms and perceived social expectancies not to feel depressed or anxious on a daily basis 
for 30 consecutive days. 
 
In addition to an overall depression score, we also investigated whether this perceived 
pressure predicted the presence of individual depression symptoms. Contemporary theories on 
psychopathology (Cramer et al., 2010; Fried, 2015; Fried & Nesse, 2015) no longer 
conceptualize MDD as a homogeneous, demarcated condition, composed by a variety of 
interchangeable symptoms (e.g. suicidal ideation vs. appetite gain), but rather understand 
depression as a dynamic system of interacting symptoms, acknowledging the fact that different 
depressive symptoms may have different risk factors (e.g. Rottenberg et al., 2007; Strange et 
al., 2016), temporal trajectories (e.g. Iacoviello et al., 2010) or consequences (e.g. Fried & 
Nesse, 2015). In this respect, these theories advocate to abandon the use of (unweighted) sum-
scores in depression research and either wish to focus on (a) different MDD symptoms 
individually or (b) to combine these in depression networks in which they explore the dynamic 
interrelations of different symptoms simultaneously (Cramer et al., 2010). The present paper 
thus investigates both the more traditional sum-score and, additionally, takes on a more 
symptom-based focus in line with the network perspective on psychopathology. 
 
Materials and Method 
Participants 
We employed Amazon’s Mechanical Turk services (MTurk), preselecting potential participants 
with elevated depression scores. Recent studies investigating characteristics of MTurk samples 
illustrated that the MTurk community endorses depression and anxiety symptoms to a 
substantially larger degree than nonclinical samples (Arditte et al., 2015), while resembling the 
general population in other demographic aspects more closely than traditional convenience 
 DEJONCKHEERE – social pressure not to feel bad in depression  
6 
 
samples (e.g. bachelor students; Casler et al., 2013), making the MTurk community a 
particularly suitable subject pool for our study. 
 
Based on a test for statistical power to detect small to medium between-person effect 
sizes (d = .30, α = .050), we intended to recruit a sample of 100 participants. An initial group 
of 987 MTurkers (56% male) completed the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; Kroenke et 
al., 2001), a scale used as a prescreening instrument for depressive symptomatology (range = 
0–27, M = 6.32, SD = 5.90). Out of the 207 potential participants with a sum-score exceeding 
the clinical cut-off (PHQ-9 ≥ 10) of Kroenke et al. (2001) and no self-reported diagnosis other 
than MDD, 194 people were randomly contacted to participate in our daily diary study, 
expecting about 120 individuals to respond to our request to take part in our daily diary protocol 
(accounting for an estimated 15% attrition, for a final sample of 100 participants). From this 
group, 121 individuals responded and began our study (53% male; PHQ-9 prescreening range 
= 11–27, M = 14.48, SD = 4.10)1. 
 
Participants were reimbursed $1 for completing the survey each day, receiving an 
additional $20 at the end of the study if they had completed 25 days or more. Nine participants2 
were excluded from our analysis due to poor compliance with the daily diary protocol (i.e. 
<50% response rate), leaving us with a final sample of 112 participants (52% male) ranging in 
age from 19 to 74 (M = 34.27, SD = 9.78). In this group, 18 participants (16%) indicated they 
currently had an MDD diagnosis. In terms of compliance, our final sample completed 28 out of 
30 daily surveys on average (range = 18–30, SD = 2.21).

Procedure and Measures 
Upon giving their informed consent and completing several other self-report questionnaires in 
a survey prior to our daily diary study (not relevant to this report), participants received a daily 
e-mail with a hyperlink to a Qualtrics questionnaire. E-mails were sent out each day at 7:00 PM 
local time and participants received instructions to complete the survey before 3:00 AM the 
next day. Questionnaires were filled out around 9:13 PM on average, with a standard deviation 
of 2 hours 30 minutes. Data from surveys completed after the instructed deadline were excluded 
from analyses. 
 
Depressive symptoms. Self-reported depressive symptoms were assessed daily using 
items directly reflecting the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for MDD (American Psychiatric 
Association, 2013). Criteria that aggregate two extremes of the same continuum (e.g. insomnia 
and hypersomnia) were covered by two separate items and suicidal ideation was not assessed. 
This resulted in a set of 11 items measuring daily depressive symptomatology, including the 
two DSM-5 core symptoms of depression: “Today to what extent did you feel sad?” (sadness); 
“Today, to what extent did you experience a diminished interest or pleasure in activities?” 
(anhedonia), complemented with nine secondary DSM-5 MDD criteria which consisted of the 
cognitive symptoms of depression: “Today, to what extent did you feel worthless?” 
(worthlessness); “Today, to what extent did you experience problems concentrating or decision 
making?” (concentration problems), and the somatic symptoms of depression: “Today, to what 
extent did you feel tired and fatigued” (fatigue); “To what extent did you feel like sleeping 
today?” (hypersomnia); “To what extent did you experience trouble sleeping last night?” 
(insomnia); “Today, to what extent did your body feel slowed down?” (psychomotor 
retardation); “Today, to what extent did your body feel agitated?” (psychomotor agitation); 
“Today, to what extend did you experience a decreased appetite compared to normal?” (appetite

loss); “Today, to what extent did you experience an increased appetite compared to normal?” 
(appetite gain). Participants rated how much they had experienced each depressive symptom 
on that particular day using a Likert-scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much). Total 
daily depression scores were obtained by averaging all symptom items per day (see Table 1 for 
descriptive statistics). The average Cronbach’s alpha across days for the daily depressive 
symptoms composite was .86, ranging from .80 to .89. 
 
Social expectancies. To measure participants’ perceived social expectancies not to 
experience negative affect, we selected 5 items from the Social Expectancies of Depression and 
Anxiety Scale (SEDAS; Bastian & Kuppens, in preparation) and reformulated them for daily 
use: “Today, I felt a great deal of pressure from others around me not to feel depressed or 
anxious.”; “Today, people expected me not to feel depressed or anxious.”; “People valued me 
today, even though I felt depressed or anxious.” (reversed); “People were disapproving of my 
feeling depressed or anxious today.”; “Today, people saw me as a failure because I felt 
depressed or anxious.”. Participants rated these items on a Likert-scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 
(very much). Data were averaged per day and per participant to reflect participants’ daily social 
expectancies not to feel anxious or depressed (see Table 1 for descriptive statistics). The 
average Cronbach’s alpha for daily perceived social expectancies was .78 and ranged from .65 
to .863. 
 
Finally, each daily questionnaire also included two bogus items to control the reliability 
of participants’ responses (e.g. “This is a control item. Please select ‘2’ for this item.”). Surveys 
with incorrect answers to these items were excluded from analyses (n = 13). 
                                                          
 
3 Leaving out the one reversed item led to an increase in internal consistency (average α = .88; range α = .82 – 
.92). While all reported analyses are based on the 5-item version, analyses using the 4-item version yielded similar 
results and support the same conclusions.

Statistical analysis 
To examine the temporal relation between perceived social pressure to avoid feeling negative 
and depression, we used vector autoregressive (VAR) models with a multilevel extension 
(Bringmann et al., 2013), meaning that slopes and intercept were allowed to vary across 
participants to account for possible interindividual differences. All predictors were within-
person centered (Hamaker & Grassman, 2015).  
 
In terms of missing data, there was no indication that the missingness was not at random 
(i.e. compliance was not related to person-characteristics, nor did we observe any time effects). 
Missing cases were therefore treated as missing (listwise deletion), with no data imputation 
techniques being carried out. Furthermore, model assumptions (i.e. equally spaced 
measurement points, stationarity and normally distributed residuals) were checked and 
observed to be sufficiently met. 
 
 
In a series of primary analyses we first determined temporal directionality between 
participants’ perceived social expectancies not to experience negative emotion and their total 
depression severity score. In a first multilevel VAR model we tested whether participants’ total 
depression score at day t was predicted by their social expectancies on the previous day (t - 1), 
controlled for their total depression score on the previous day (t - 1). Conversely, in a second 
multilevel VAR model we tested whether participants’ social expectancies at day t were 
predicted by their total depression score on the previous day (t - 1), controlling for their social 
expectancies on the previous day (t - 1).  
 
Next to the total depression score, we repeated these analyses for participants’ perceived 
social expectancies and each of the 11 individual depression symptoms separately. To reduce 
 DEJONCKHEERE – social pressure not to feel bad in depression

the occurrence of Type-I errors, we controlled for multiple testing (n = 11) using a False 
Discovery Rate (FDR) procedure as proposed by Benjamini & Hochberg (1995). 
 
  
So far, our analyses addressed the role of these perceived social expectancies in relation 
to either a total depression score or each depressive symptom individually. In a secondary and 
exploratory series of analyses, a network perspective on depressive symptomatology was 
adopted, allowing us to inspect multiple temporal relations between different variables 
simultaneously (e.g. Bringmann et al., 2015). We examined the role of this perceived social 
pressure in four different depression networks. A distinction was made between DSM-5 core, 
cognitive and somatic symptoms (Uher et al., 2008), with the last symptom category being 
divided in positive and negative somatic symptoms. Each network composed several multilevel 
VAR models, in which every variable once served as an outcome, regressed on its day-lagged 
version, as well as on the day-lagged version of each of the other dependent variables in the 
network. In this way auto- and cross-regressive effects of one variable could be determined, 
controlled for the predictive value of other variables in the network. Variables were within-
person standardized (Schuurman et al., 2016) and in each network we controlled for multiple 
testing using an FDR procedure (Benjamini et al., 2006), since no explicit hypotheses were 
specified about the dynamic interplay among individual depression symptoms4. Results were 
visualized using the qgraph R package (Epskamp et al., 2012). 
  
For each symptom network centrality strength plots were calculated, displaying the in- 
and outstrength centrality of each node in the network. These values refer to the sum of the 
                                                          
 
4 A depression network that included all depressive symptoms was not computed, as we deemed this too 
exploratory, and containing too many variables, creating instability of edges. Instead we constructed four smaller 
symptom networks, making a trade-off between a bottom-up approach (i.e. looking at the data with the 
appropriate significance threshold) and a top-down perspective (i.e. making a meaningful distinction between 
different symptom categories relying on theoretical propositions), allowing us to make relevant claims within 
appropriate borders.

absolute weights of respectively all incoming or outgoing connections that are present in a node, 
indicating whether a variable either plays a following or instigating role in the network. Put 
differently, a node with high outstrength centrality has the capacity to predict other variables in 
the network. In contrast, a node with high instrength centrality is predicted by the other 
variables in the network. 
 
Some caution is advised, however, when interpreting the results of these network 
analyses. In- and outstrength centrality measures are only meaningful within the network they 
are calculated from and heavily depend on the (amount of) nodes present. Adding or removing 
nodes will entail different results and might even yield ordinal changes in centrality. 
Furthermore, estimating meaningful confidence intervals for centrality measures is currently 
impossible (see Epskamp et al., under revision), which makes the results presented next fairly 
exploratory in nature.

Primary analyses. First, daily total depression severity scores were significantly 
predicted by both total depression scores and perceived social expectancies on the previous day. 
Daily perceived social expectancies on the other hand, were only significantly predicted by 
 DEJONCKHEERE – social pressure not to feel bad in depression  
14 
 
daily perceived social expectancies on the day before, with previous-day total depression scores 
not contributing to this prediction (see Table 2). Next, when investigating the temporal relations 
between these social expectancies and each of the 11 depression symptoms individually, several 
findings are noteworthy (see Table 2). First, both DSM-5 core symptoms of depression, sadness 
and anhedonia, were positively predicted by a person’s social expectancies perceived on the 
previous day, but not vice versa. Second, in terms of cognitive symptoms, daily social 
expectancies also predicted an increase in feelings of worthlessness and concentration problems 
on the next day, but again not vice versa. Finally, for the somatic symptoms in depression, 
participants’ perceived social expectancies predicted increases in fatigue, hypersomnia, 
psychomotor retardation and appetite loss, but not insomnia, psychomotor agitation and 
appetite gain. Autoregressive effects were significant for all individual symptoms (β’s ≥ 0.07, 
p’s ≤ .005), indicating that each symptom was meaningfully predicted by its score on the

5 To eliminate the possibility that our findings were merely driven by the subsample that reported having an MDD 
diagnosis (n = 18), we reran all analyses without these cases. With only one minor difference (i.e. social 
expectancies now did predict an increase in psychomotor agitation, where in the presented analyses it did not), 
our conclusions remain identical.

Fig. 1. Estimated depression networks for social expectancies and DSM-5 depressive (a) core symptoms, 
(b) cognitive symptoms, (c) positive somatic symptoms and (d) negative somatic symptoms. Solid green 
arrows surpassed the significance threshold after applying FDR (Benjamini et al., 2006) and represent 
a positive relationship between two nodes. In contrast, dashed gray edges did not survive the correction 
for multiple testing. Both transparency and thickness of an arrow represent the strength of a connection 
(i.e. magnitude of the fixed effect), with the scaling being proportional to the strongest edge in the 
network. Each network is accompanied by its centrality strength plot, displaying the in- and outstrength 
centrality of each node in the network. These measures are based on all cross-regressive coefficients 
(i.e. not only the significant ones). EXP = Perceived social expectancies not to feel sad or anxious; SAD 
= Sadness; ANH = Anhedonia; CON = Concentration problems; WOR = Worthlessness; AGI = 
Psychomotor agitation; HYP = Hypersomnia; APG = Appetite gain; RET = Psychomotor retardation; 
INS = Insomnia; FAT = Fatigue; APL = Appetite loss. 
 
Secondary analyses. As Figure 1a illustrates, regarding the DSM-5 core symptoms of 
depression, social expectancies and sadness both predicted a significant increase in anhedonia, 
resulting in a relatively high outstrength centrality for social expectancies and sadness and a 
high instrength centrality for anhedonia. Among cognitive depression symptoms social 
expectancies predicted a significant increase in concentration problems and worthlessness, 
leaving social expectancies with the highest outstrength centrality and lowest instrength 
centrality (Fig. 1b). For positive somatic symptoms the only cross-regressive link that remained 
significant after applying FDR was hypersomnia predicting an increase in psychomotor 
agitation. Based on all edges, social expectancies were characterized by the highest outstrength 
centrality, while psychomotor agitation had the highest instrength centrality (Fig. 1c). Finally, 
for negative somatic symptoms insomnia positively predicted psychomotor retardation and 
fatigue, while the latter also predicted an increase psychomotor retardation. Social expectancies 
 DEJONCKHEERE – social pressure not to feel bad in depression

predicted an increase in fatigue. Based on the centrality strength plot, fatigue was characterized 
by the highest outstrength centrality, while psychomotor retardation had the highest instrength 
centrality (Fig. 1d). 
 
Discussion 
Drawing on daily life data of a sample with elevated depression scores, we examined the role 
of perceived social pressure not to experience negative affect in the prediction of depressive 
symptoms. We found converging evidence that perceived social expectancies not to feel sad or 
anxious do not follow from depressive symptoms, but rather themselves predict increases in 
depressive symptomatology. The more pressure a person perceives from his social environment 
not to experience negative emotions, the more likely that person is to experience an increase in 
depressive symptoms. This did not only apply for overall depression severity, but also for the 
vast majority of individual depressive symptoms. Higher levels of perceived pressure not to 
feel negative predicted increases in both MDD’s core and cognitive symptomatology. For 
somatic symptoms, only inhibiting, slowed-down symptoms of depression (fatigue, 
hypersomnia, psychomotor retardation, appetite loss) were predicted by these perceived social 
expectancies, not their activating counterparts (insomnia, psychomotor agitation, appetite gain). 
This suggests that perceiving social pressure not to experience negative emotions seems to have 
a dampening rather than augmenting somatic effect, a finding that a traditional depression sum-
score approach could not have captured (e.g. Fried & Nesse, 2015). Finally, exploratory 
centrality analyses were in line with the current findings. When multiple relations between 
depressive symptoms and these perceived social expectancies were assessed simultaneously in 
various depression networks, experiencing social pressure not to feel anxious or depressed was 
characterized by a relatively high out- and low instrength centrality, meaning that this pressure 
plays a rather instigating than following role in depression.

While traditional depression research generally focusses on the role of person-specific 
characteristics (e.g. from genes and biomarkers to cognitive and behavioral styles), current 
findings suggest that (the perception of) larger-scale factors like societal norms are also likely 
to have implications for people’s psychological well-being. When society pressures people to 
pursue the unattainable state of constant happiness, while marginalizing the natural occurrence 
of negative emotions like sadness and anxiety, this inevitably creates a discrepancy between 
people’s experienced mood and these salient reference values. Failing to live up to what you 
perceive as the social standard might lead to negative self-evaluations (Bastian et al., 2012; 
Carver & Scheier, 1990), resulting in the seemingly paradoxical amplification of these non-
normative emotional states.  
 
Clinical implications 
Interventions that tackle this perceived social pressure may be implemented both on a micro 
and macro level, referring to the individual or broader society respectively. From a micro 
perspective, an individual’s perception does not necessarily match objective reality (Jussim, 
1991). Counselors who communicate the apparent societal acceptability and functionality of 
negative emotions, may challenge the beliefs their clients hold about their social environment 
(e.g. cognitive restructuring; Clark, 2014), finding a possible gateway to decrease their 
depressive complaints (Bastian et al., 2012). Furthermore, it is of note that a balanced view on 
positive versus negative emotion is already strongly implied in a lot of the third wave cognitive 
behavioral psychotherapies (e.g. Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, Linehan, 2014; Acceptance 
and Commitment Therapy, Hayes et al., 1999; Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy, Kabat-
Zinn, 2003), which are known to be effective in treating depression (Kahl et al., 2012). These 
therapeutic approaches all share their origin in Eastern Buddhist culture where a dialectic 
 DEJONCKHEERE – social pressure not to feel bad in depression  
19 
 
worldview is emphasized, promoting a balanced embrace of one’s emotional repertoire. Finally, 
creating a receptive and caring social platform (e.g. in the form of therapeutic family sessions) 
might also be beneficial (Brown & Andrews, 1986). 
 
With respect to possible interventions on a macro level, large-scale (psycho-
)educational programs that destigmatize occasionally feeling sad or anxious and tackle people’s 
prejudice towards mood disorders, are likely to be essential in gradually shifting society’s 
conception of negative emotion. 
 
Limitations 
Several limitations are noteworthy to our study. For one, the current sample was not assessed 
in a clinical setting. Although all participants reported considerable depressive complaints, as 
they all surpassed a clinical threshold on a depression screening instrument, this may have led 
to a possible underrepresentation of the more severely impaired individuals suffering from 
depression. 
 
Second, the current investigation only addressed the temporal relationship between 
perceiving social pressure not to feel negative and depression. Although determining temporal 
precedence is a first important step and necessary condition, direct causal claims about this 
relationship cannot be made. However, combined with preliminary experimental evidence 
showing that manipulating social expectancies leads to increases in negative emotion and 
decreases in well-being (Bastian et al., 2012), our results are suggestive that perceiving social 
pressure to avoid the experience of negative emotions could indeed increase the occurrence of 
depressive symptoms in daily life. Nevertheless, further experimental work is needed to 
pinpoint the exact mechanisms and possible boundary conditions.

Third, a logical question following these findings is what factors influence these 
perceived social expectancies. As the current design is correlational, the apparent relationship 
between this social pressure and depression may be explained by other unobserved variables. 
For example, processes like social alienation or lack of social support (e.g. Brown & Andrews, 
1986) could possibly be important antecedents in the current chain of events, making this 
perceived social pressure merely a mediator in predicting depressive symptoms. 
 
 
Finally, it is currently unclear to what degree the current findings are specific to 
depression. In fact, it seems plausible to hypothesize that perceiving social pressure not to feel 
sad or anxious may also predict so-called secondary disturbances (i.e. the process of 
experiencing more negative affect in response to the experience of negative affect; Bastian et 
al., 2015) in people suffering from, for instance, various anxiety disorders. Whether these 
perceived expectancies also predict increases in other anxiety-related symptoms (e.g. heart 
palpitations or shortness of breath in patients with panic disorder or an increase in obstructive 
thoughts and checking behavior in people with obsessive-compulsive disorder), remains 
nevertheless to be explored. 
 
Conclusion 
In conclusion, our findings indicate that experiencing pressure not to feel negative emotions, 
paradoxically predicts an increase in depressive symptoms over time. In this way, the current 
study may reveal a possible malignant consequence of society’s one-sided focus on happiness 
and denouncement of negative emotions. A societal discourse that promotes a more balanced 
embracement of the emotional repertoire could possibly be more beneficial for people’s well-
being.
