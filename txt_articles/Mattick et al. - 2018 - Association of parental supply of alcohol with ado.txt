Summary
Background Some parents supply alcohol to their children, reportedly to reduce harm, yet longitudinal research on risks 
associated with such supply is compromised by short periods of observation and potential confounding. 
We aimed to investigate associations between parental supply and supply from other (non-parental) sources, with 
 
subsequent drinking outcomes over a 6-year period of adolescence, adjusting for child, parent, family, and peer variables.
Methods We did this prospective cohort study using data from the Australian Parental Supply of Alcohol Longitudinal 
Study cohort of adolescents. Children in grade 7 (mean age 12 years), and their parents, were recruited between 
2010 and 2011 from secondary schools in Sydney, Perth, and Hobart, Australia, and were surveyed annually between 
2010 and 2016. We examined the association of exposure to parental supply and other sources of alcohol in 1 year with 
five outcomes in the subsequent year: binge drinking (more than four standard drinks on a drinking occasion); 
alcohol-related harms; and symptoms of alcohol abuse (as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders, 4th edition [DSM-IV]), alcohol dependence, and alcohol use disorder (as defined by DSM-5). This trial is 
registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02280551.
Findings Between September, 2010, and June, 2011, we recruited 1927 eligible parents and adolescents (mean age 
12·9 years [SD 0·52]). Participants were followed up until 2016, during which time binge drinking and experience of 
alcohol-related harms increased. Adolescents who were supplied alcohol only by parents had higher odds of subsequent 
binge consumption (odds ratio [OR] 2·58, 95% CI 1·96–3·41; p<0·0001), alcohol-related harm (2·53, 1·99–3·24; 
p<0·0001), and symptoms of alcohol use disorder (2·51, 1·46–4·29; p=0·0008) than did those reporting no supply. 
Parental supply of alcohol was not significantly associated with the odds of reporting symptoms of either alcohol abuse 
or dependence, compared with no supply from any source. Supply from other sources was associated with significant 
risks of all adverse outcomes, compared with no supply, with an even greater increased risk of adverse outcomes.
Interpretation Providing alcohol to children is associated with alcohol-related harms. There is no evidence to support 
the view that parental supply protects from adverse drinking outcomes by providing alcohol to their child. Parents 
should be advised that this practice is associated with risk, both directly and indirectly through increased access to 
alcohol from other sources.

Introduction
Alcohol use is an important public health issue associated 
with increased disease burden, and is of special concern 
in late adolescence and young adulthood, when alcohol 
use disorders have their peak age of onset.1–3 In many 
countries (such as the UK), parents are an important 
provider of alcohol to adolescents before they reach the 
legal age of purchase.4 Parents reportedly provide alcohol 
to mitigate harm,5 but evidence about the associated risks 
of such parental provision is absent—partly because of 
the dearth of any prospective studies spanning more 
than a 2–3-year period, and substantially because of the 
failure to adequately adjust for confounders in the 
handful of available cohort studies.6
Our previous Australian adolescent cohort study7 found 
that between ages 12 and 15 years, parental supply of 
alcohol was associated with increased risk of consuming 
standard drinks, but not of binge drinking.7 Although 
there was no protective effect associated with early 
parental supply, parentally supplied children did con-
sume fewer alcohol beverages on a typical drinking 
occasion than did children who obtained their alcohol 
from other, non-parental sources. Adolescents who 
sourced their alcohol from non-parental sources 
(eg, peers, other relatives, them 
selves) had greater odds 
both of drinking standard drinks and of binge drinking. 
No longitudinal research has examined the development

of alcohol use disorder symptoms associated with 
parental supply. In view of the associations between 
supply of alcohol and adverse drinking behaviours in our 
cohort to date, it is important to examine whether these 
patterns continue (possibly more moderated drinking 
associated with parental supply compared with more 
excessive drinking associated with accessing alcohol from 
non-parental 
sources), 
and 
to 
examine 
risk 
of 
alcohol-related harm and alcohol use disorders symptoms.
We aimed to study parental and non-parental supply of 
alcohol and adjusted associations with five primary 
outcome variables in adolescents: binge drinking, alcohol-
related harms, and the experience of symptoms of alcohol 
abuse, alcohol dependence, and alcohol use disorder.
Methods
Study design and participants
Between September, 2010, and June, 2011, a cohort of 
1927 adolescents, and their parents, were recruited from 
grade 7 classes in 24 private independent (49%), six 
Catholic (12%), and 19 government (39%) secondary 
schools in Sydney, Perth, and Hobart. A detailed description 
of the recruitment methods, cohort characteristics, and 
repre 
sentativeness is provided in the appendix (pp 4–8). 
The parents of grade 7 adolescents had to provide signed 
informed consent to be eligible.8,9 The cohort was similar to 
the Australian population on important demographic 
measures, parental alcohol use, and child alcohol use.9–12 
At wave 1 (grade 7 of secondary school), adolescents were a 
mean age of 12·9 years (SD 0·52), and similar to the 
Australian population in terms of sex distribution, 
household composition, racial background, and parental 
education. Groups of lower socioeconomic status are 
somewhat under-represented in the cohort; the predomi-
nance of students from non-government schools is likely 
to have biased the cohort towards higher levels of 
advantage compared with the general population.9–12
Ethics approval was given by UNSW Sydney, and 
Universities of Tasmania, Newcastle, Queensland, 
and Curtin University. We obtained signed parental 
consent for each adolescent participant.
Procedures
Adolescents and parents completed paper or online 
questionnaires independently of each other to minimise 
reporting biases; adolescent self-report on alcohol 
behaviours has been shown to be reliable and valid 
(appendix pp 9–24, 85–99).13,14
Outcomes
There were five variables, based on adolescent report of: 
binge drinking; experience of alcohol-related harms; and 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We did a systematic review, searching eight electronic databases 
on Sept 10, 2016 (Medline, MEDLINE In-Process and Other 
Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Scopus, 
Dissertations and Theses, and Cochrane Library), with the search 
terms “parental provision”, “social hosting”, “parental source of 
alcohol”, “youth”, “student”, teenage”, “underage”, “minor”, 
“risky drinking”, “excessive drinking”, and “binge drinking”. 
Inclusion criteria were that studies must be peer-reviewed, 
prospective, longitudinal studies, and analyse parental supply 
on the basis of reports from adolescent, parent, or both, and 
were from any publication year. We found seven cohort studies 
of parental supply of alcohol; the results of these showed that 
parental supply of alcohol was associated with subsequent risky 
drinking (pooled estimate odds ratio 2·00, 95% CI 1·72–2·32), 
but there was substantial risk of confounding bias and 
publication bias (assessed with the Newcastle–Ottawa scale). In 
all studies, measurement of exposure was problematic, 
follow-up times were short, and confounding was poorly 
controlled. Our cohort study has previously shown that, 
between age 12–15 years, parental supply of alcohol was 
associated with increased risk of consuming standard drinks (a 
standard drink being equal to 10 g of alcohol), but not of binge 
drinking. Parentally supplied children consumed fewer alcohol 
beverages on a typical drinking occasion than those who 
obtained their alcohol from non-parental sources. No study has 
reported on prospective associations between parental and 
other sources of supply of alcohol and subsequent adolescent 
drinking outcomes, harms, and symptoms of abuse, 
dependence, or alcohol use disorders, taking into account 
important potential confounders of any observed association.
Added value of this study
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine, 
over a long period of time, prospective associations between 
both parental supply of alcohol and supply from other sources, 
and subsequent adolescent drinking outcomes, and to adjust 
for known covariates. We found a developing pattern of harm 
associated with parental supply, such that by the sixth follow-
up (mean age 17·8 years), parental supply during previous years 
was associated with binge drinking, alcohol-related harms, and 
alcohol use disorder symptoms. The findings also showed that 
parental supply of alcohol not only risks adverse outcomes 
itself, it also risks increasing supply from other non-parental 
sources. Non-parental supply was associated with an even 
greater increased risk of adverse outcomes.
Implications of all the available evidence
Parental provision of alcohol to adolescents is associated with 
subsequent binge drinking, alcohol-related harm, alcohol use 
disorder symptoms, and increased access to alcohol from 
non-parental sources, and these associations persist after 
controlling for confounding variables. These findings have 
importance for parents, policy makers, and clinicians, and 
highlight parents as an important target for prevention.

experience of symptoms of alcohol abuse, alcohol 
dependence, and alcohol use disorder.
We defined binge drinking as consumption of more 
than four standard drinks (a standard drink being equal 
to 10 g of alcohol)15 on any single occasion in the past 
year, which was coded into a binary variable (no or yes). 
This definition is in line with Australian guidelines for 
adults, which recommend that healthy adults drink no 
more than four standard drinks on a single occasion to 
reduce the risk of alcohol-related injury.16
Adolescents were also asked about the frequency of 
experiencing a range of alcohol-related harms, using a 
scale that included 17 alcohol-related harms.17 A binary 
variable (no or yes) was coded, indicating whether any of 
the harms had been experienced. Two additional count 
outcomes were derived: number of different harms 
experienced (possible range 0–17), and total number of 
harms experienced, which was constructed by summing 
the six frequency response categories for each item 
(possible range 0–85; appendix pp 9–10).
We assessed symptoms of alcohol abuse from 
wave 2 using the alcohol abuse items from the Diagnostic 
Interview Schedule for Children-IV (DISC-IV).18 A binary 
variable (no or yes) was coded, indicating whether any of 
the abuse symptom items had been experienced or not in 
the past 12 months, corresponding to the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition 
(DSM-IV) criteria (appendix p 25). We constructed an 
additional count outcome by summing the number of 
abuse symptoms experienced (possible range 0–4).
We assessed symptoms of alcohol dependence from 
wave 5 using the alcohol dependence items from DISC-IV.18 
A binary variable (no or yes) was coded, indicating whether 
three or more of the dependence symptom items had been 
experienced in the past 12 months, corresponding to DSM-
IV criteria (appendix p 26). We constructed an additional 
count outcome by summing the number of dependence 
symptoms experienced (possible range 0–7).
Finally, we assessed symptoms of an alcohol use 
disorder from wave 5 using the alcohol dependence items 
from DISC-IV,18 including an International Classification 
of Diseases item assessing craving, which corresponded 
with DSM-5 criteria (appendix p 27). A categorical variable 
was coded on the basis of number of alcohol use disorder 
symptoms experienced in the past year (no alcohol use 
disorder [none or one symptom], mild [2–3 symptoms], 
moderate [4–5 symptoms], or severe [≥6 symptoms]).
Adolescents were asked about who supplied them 
alcohol (sips or standard drinks) in the past 12 months, 
including mother, father, other adults, friends, siblings, 
and self-supply. From this, a dichotomous exposure 
variable—parental supply—was coded, indicating partici-
pants who had received alcohol from parents and those 
who had not. Adolescent report of parental supply was 
used because adolescent measures have been shown to 
be more predictive of adolescent behaviours than have 
parent measures,19 and adolescent self-report correlated 
well with parental report of supply (intraclass correlation 
0·69–0·79; appendix p 29).
A further source of alcohol exposure—other supply—
included alcohol supply from non-parental adults, friends, 
siblings, or self-supply, compared with adolescents 
reporting no supply from these sources. Parental supply 
and other supply were not mutually exclusive, and since 
supply could be derived from both sources, each source 
was controlled for separately in all analyses.
For the primary analysis, exposures were coded as a 
four-level variable: no supply of alcohol, parental supply 
only, other supply only, or both parental and other supply. 
In other analyses, parental supply and other supply were 
coded as separate variables. For a secondary planned 
dose–response analysis, the exposure variables were 
coded into two measures of the number of years in which 
supply occurred (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5).
Covariates, which we chose on the basis of the literature 
on adolescent drinking, and measured at each annual 
wave, are described elsewhere.9 These include parental 
report of their own alcohol consumption (quantity and 
frequency), presence of familial alcohol problems, 
potential home access to alcohol without parental 
knowledge, parental religiosity, family conflict or positive 
relations, the presence of older siblings in the home, 
socioeconomic status of area of residence, parental 
employment and income, and country of birth. Children 
reported on the supply of alcohol from parental and from 
other sources; parental responsiveness, demandingness, 
or consistency; parental use of alcohol-specific rules; 
parental monitoring of the child’s activities; whether they 
were living in a one-parent or two-parent household; 
child sex and age; availability of money to purchase 
alcohol; child tobacco use; child externalising behaviour; 
child anxiety and depression symptoms; and their peer’s 
substance use and disapproval of alcohol and tobacco use 
(appendix pp 13–19).
Statistical analysis
We included data from 6 years (waves 1–6) in this study. 
We planned primary analyses a priori, and did analyses 
using random intercept mixed-effects (controlling for 
within-respondent clustering or correlation over time), to 
examine the unadjusted and adjusted associations 
between the exposures and five main outcomes. We also 
analysed these five outcomes using logistic regression, 
with results presented as odds ratios (ORs) and CIs. We 
analysed severity of alcohol use disorder (mild, moderate, 
severe) and binge drinking (none, 5–10, ≥11 drinks) using 
multinomial logistic regression with results presented as 
relative risk ratios.
We analysed the four secondary count outcomes 
(reported number of different harms, total number of 
harms, number of abuse symptoms, and number of 
dependence symptoms) using a priori planned negative 
binomial regression, with results presented as incidence 
rate ratios (IRRs).

We analysed data from six annual waves, with supply 
(parental only, other only, and both) compared with no 
supply from each year, examined against the outcomes 
from the following year. The analysis thus included five 
paired time periods (period 1 [waves 1–2], period 2 
[waves 2–3], period 3 [waves 3–4], period 4 [waves 4–5], 
and period 5 [waves 5–6]). Variables were included in 
adjusted analyses if they showed unadjusted significance 
at an α of 0·05.
To test for a dose–response relationship, we did 
planned secondary analyses examining the association 
between the number of waves of parental or other 
supply (between 0 and 5 years of supply) and harms 
reported in wave 6, using fixed-effect logistic or negative 
binomial regression, and the same five outcomes as the 
primary analyses and the four secondary count 
variables, using multiple imputation to reduce bias due 
to missing data (appendix pp 33–35). We also did 
random intercept analyses of the frequency of supply 
within each wave on the five primary outcomes. We did 
post-hoc sensitivity analyses of associations with 
11 individual symptoms of alcohol abuse, dependence, 
or use disorders (in light of the rates of endorsement of 
alcohol use disorder symptoms). Finally, in another 
post-hoc analysis, we examined the association between 
parental supply and subsequent other supply using 
random intercept models. We did all analyses in Stata 
(version 14.1), using a decision-wise error rate of 
p<0·05 for planned analyses, reduced to p<0·01 for 
post-hoc analyses.20
We used data from the Australian Parental Supply of 
Alcohol Longitudinal Study (APSALS) cohort of 
adolescents, which is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov 
(NCT02280551).

Results
The study profile is shown in the figure. The mean age of 
adolescent participants was 12·9 years (SD 0·52) in wave 
1, 13·9 years (0·54) in wave 2, 14·8 years (0·56) in wave 3, 
15·8 years (0·55) in wave 4, 16·9 years (0·50) in wave 5, 
and 17·8 years (0·51) in wave 6. At wave 6, 1494 (92%) of 
1629 participants were attending high school. All forms of 
parental supply of alcohol (ie, adolescents who had 
parental supply only or both parental and other supply) 
increased across the six waves of observation, with such 
supply reported by 291 (15%) of 1910 adolescents in wave 
1, 472 (26%) of 1836 in wave 2, 486 (27%) of 1776 in wave 3, 
583 (34%) of 1705 in wave 4, 729 (44%) of 1671 in wave 5, 
and 916 (57%) of 1618 respondents in wave 6 (2 of 1673 
cases had missing data at wave 5, and 11 of 1629 cases had 
missing data on this measure at wave 6; appendix p 36). 
Parental, familial, child, and peer characteristics associated 
with parental supply are shown in the appendix (p 38), 
with information related to the context of supply (special 
occasion, dinners, parties, etc), and the frequency and 
typical quantity supplied by parents (p 37).
Binge drinking and experience of alcohol-related harms 
increased markedly over time (table 1). Whereas only 
77 (4%) of 1910 adolescents reported experiencing alcohol-
related harm at wave 1, by wave 6 this had increased to 
978 (60%) of 1618 (table 1). Endorsement of symptoms of

dependence 
(at 
least 
three 
DISC-IV 
symptoms; 
appendix p 31) were less common, with 120 (7%) of 1618 
 
reporting alcohol abuse symptoms and 189 (12%) reporting 
alcohol dependence at wave 6; alcohol use disorder 
symptoms (at least two DISC-IV symptoms; appendix 
p 32) were reported by 353 (22%) adolescents at wave 6.
At wave 6, the rates of binge drinking, alcohol-related 
harm, and symptoms of abuse, dependence, and alcohol 
use disorder were higher among adolescents who 
reported both parental and other supply than parental or 
other supply individually (table 1). Adolescents could get 
alcohol from parents, other non-parental sources, or 
both, so these are coded as parental supply only, other 
supply only, or both sources of supply. Specifically, 
632 (81%) of 784 adolescents who received alcohol both 
from their parents and from others reported that they 
had binged, 671 (86%) experienced alcohol-related harm, 
102 
(13%) 
reported 
alcohol 
abuse 
symptoms, 
145 (18%) had at least three dependence symptoms, and 
284 (36%) reported at least two alcohol use disorder 
symptoms (table 1). The most frequently reported alcohol 
use disorder symptoms in adolescents supplied with 
alcohol by their parents (n=916) were reported tolerance 
(n=310 [34%]), drinking larger amounts or for longer 
than intended (n=283 [31%]), and spending time getting, 
consuming, or recovering from alcohol (n=159 [17%]; 
appendix p 28). The outcome measures were significantly 
inter-correlated; for example, binge drinking was 
moderately correlated with harms (0·66) and weakly 
correlated with abuse symptoms (0·23), and alcohol use 
disorder symptoms were strongly correlated with depen-
dence symptoms (0·97; appendix p 39). 
Adolescents who reported parental supply only had 
significantly higher odds of binge drinking (OR 2·58, 
95% CI 1·96–3·41; p<0·0001) in the subsequent wave, 
compared with those reporting no supply, a result 
consistent with higher levels of bingeing (appendix 
pp 46–48). Adolescents who reported other supply only 
had even greater odds of binge drinking (5·58, 4·27–7·29; 
p<0·0001) compared with those reporting no supply. 
Those who reported both parental and other supply also 
had increased odds of binge drinking (4·81, 3·75–6·17; 
p<0·0001), which was higher than for parental supply 
only, but was lower than would be expected if the effects 
of receiving parental supply only and other supply only 
were combined (table 2).

Data are n/N (%). Figures might differ from figure 1 because of missing data. If a participant was missing data on the parental supply or other supply variable, they were coded as missing because we were unable 
to confirm whether they also received alcohol from the missing source. NA=not asked. *Results for abuse symptoms do not consider diagnostic criterion B from Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders, 4th edition—that dependence not be diagnosable— but when diagnostic criterion B is considered, percentages with abuse symptoms in wave 6 are 0·8% for participants who did not receive parental 
supply (n=3), 4·9% for those who did (n=45), and 3·2% for the total sample (n=52). †Abuse questions were not asked in wave 1. ‡Dependence and alcohol use disorder questions were not asked in waves 1–4.

Similarly, adolescents reporting parental supply only or 
other supply only had significantly higher odds of 
experiencing alcohol-related harms than did those 
reporting no supply (parental supply OR 2·53, 95% CI 
1·96–3·34, p<0·0001; other supply 3·46, 2·68–4·47; 
p<0·0001). Those reporting both parental and other 
supply also had increased odds of alcohol-related harms 
(4·25, 3·38–5·36; p<0·0001), however, as with binge 
drinking, although the odds ratio was higher than 
parental supply only, it was lower than would be expected 
if the effects of parental supply only and other supply 
only were combined (table 2).
Those reporting parental supply only had significantly 
increased odds of DSM-5 alcohol use disorder compared 
with no supply (OR 2·51, 95% CI 1·46–4·29; p=0·0008), 
as did those reporting other supply only (3·81, 2·45–5·91; 
p<0·0001), and those reporting both parental and other 
supply (5·79, 3·78–8·86; p<0·0001). Parental supply only 
was not significantly associated with the odds of reporting 
symptoms of either DSM-IV outcome (abuse or 
dependence), compared with no supply from any source. 
However, other supply only was associated with much 
higher odds of both abuse symptoms (5·30, 3·14–8·94; 
p<0·0001) and dependence symptoms (3·01, 1·58–5·72; 
p=0·0008) compared with no supply from any source. 
Adolescents who reported both parental and other supply 
also had higher odds of alcohol abuse symptoms (5·21, 
3·15–8·59; p<0·0001) and alcohol dependence symptoms 
(5·04, 2·70–9·42; p<0·0001; table 2).
There were significant random effects for all models 
used to examine the associations between supply and 
outcomes: binge drinking (intercept SD 1·33, p<0·0001), 
reporting any harms (1·21, p<0·0001), reporting abuse 
symptoms (1·07, p<0·0001), reporting dependence 
symptoms (1·58, p<0·0001), and reporting alcohol use 
disorder symptoms (0·96, p=0·0009).
Similar to the results for our primary analysis, when we 
examined the number of harms and symptoms 
experienced by adolescents, parental supply of alcohol was 
associated with higher rates of harms (IRR 1·42, 95% CI 
1·27–1·58), total number of harms (1·49, 1·30–1·70), 
and number of dependence symptoms (1·56, 1·31–1·87)—
but not the number of abuse symptoms (0·90, 
0·66–1·24)—than was no parental supply (appendix 
pp 63–64). Abuse symptoms were infrequently endorsed.
Analysis of the number of waves of parental supply 
showed evidence of a dose–response relationship 
between number of waves of parental supply and binge 
drinking and report of harms, but not the DSM 
outcomes (appendix pp 65–82). There was also evidence 
of a dose–response relationship with supply of alcohol 
from other sources, particularly for alcohol abuse, with 
the ORs increasing as the number of waves of other 
supply increased (appendix pp 65–55). Analysis of 
frequency of supply within each year showed significant 
associations between frequency of parental supply and 
all outcomes except abuse symptoms, which is 
consistent with the results from our primary analysis 
(appendix pp 65–82).
Adjusted analysis of the relationship between parental 
supply and other supply, to explore whether withholding 
parental supply leads to higher rates of later other supply, 
showed that parental supply was associated with double 
the odds of other supply in the subsequent wave (OR 2·05 
95% CI 1·69–2·48), compared with no parental supply. 
This was true both of supply of sips (2·03, 1·66–2·49) and 
standard drinks (2·67, 1·81–3·95; appendix pp 83–84).
Consistent with the primary analysis, analyses of 
parental supply and self-supply showed a significant 
interaction effect, as did analyses of parental and peer 
supply (appendix pp 51–62). Analyses of potential 
interaction effects between parental supply and sex or 
wave were not significant for any outcome, suggesting 
the effect was consistent by sex and over time.

Data are adjusted odds ratio (95% CI); p value. Results are from random intercept mixed-effects logistic regression 
models, which we adjusted for other covariates (appendix pp 40–45). Data are included as paired waves, with 
covariates from one wave and outcome from subsequent wave. NA=not asked. *Dependence and alcohol use disorder 
symptoms were first assessed in wave 5, so only two time periods (waves 4 and 5) were included for analysis.

associations between both parental supply of alcohol and 
supply from other sources, and subsequent adolescent 
drinking outcomes, harms, and self-reported symptoms 
of alcohol abuse, dependence, and alcohol use disorder, 
adjusting for known covariates. In this six-wave 
longitudinal cohort study, we observed a pattern of 
adverse alcohol-related outcomes in adolescents aged 
12·9 years to 17·8 years, associated with parental supply. 
Parental supply only was associated with a higher 
incidence of binge drinking, alcohol-related harm(s), and 
symptoms of alcohol use disorder, compared with no 
supply. These results are by contrast with our results 
assessing alcohol use in adolescents aged 15·9 years, for 
whom parental supply was associated with consumption 
of alcohol, but not binge drinking (a previous null result 
due to insufficient power).7 Over time, alcohol 
consumption has significantly increased, and adolescents 
are at a higher risk of adverse drinking outcomes, 
reflecting the cohort having entered a phase of life when 
binge drinking is known to increase.21
Obtaining alcohol from other sources (ie, other supply 
only) was associated with increased risk of all primary 
outcomes, including binge consumption, alcohol-related 
harm(s), and symptoms of abuse, dependence and 
alcohol use disorder, compared with no supply. 
Additionally, there was evidence of a dose–response 
relationship between other supply and the five primary 
outcomes, which is consistent with earlier age of initiation 
being associated with later bingeing (appendix pp 65–82).22
Although other supply was associated with more 
problems than was parental supply, our study shows that 
there is no rationale for parents to give alcohol to 
adolescents younger than the legal purchase age. Parental 
supply only remains associated with adverse adolescent 
drinking outcomes, compared with no supply, and a 
combination of parental and other supply was not 
associated with lower odds of adverse outcomes than 
other supply only. Thus, there was no evidence to support 
the view that parental supply is protective for any of the 
adolescent drinking-related outcomes.
The child and parent characteristics predicting parental 
supply have not been well documented, but there are 
repeated observations that parents supply alcohol to 
protect their children from heavy drinking,5,23 and that 
lenient parental alcohol rules, and perceptions of peer 
alcohol use, predict parental supply.24 Qualitative research 
shows that some parents might see providing alcohol as 
ensuring the child fits in with peers, and to ensure harm 
minimisation.25 Although it could be tempting to infer 
that because other supply of alcohol is associated with 
higher risk of adverse outcomes, and therefore that 
parental supply should be preferred, the results of our 
analyses indicate that parental supply could directly 
increase risk of harms, while also increasing the 
likelihood of later supply by others. These results, taken 
together, reinforce the notion that alcohol consumption 
leads to harm, and this is true regardless of the source of 
that alcohol—be it parents or others. In short, parental 
supply is not associated with any benefit (ie, reduction in 
drinking behaviours or harms). These results support 
the promotion of a precautionary approach to adolescent 
alcohol supply by parents; to reduce the risk of alcohol-
related harm, parents should avoid supplying alcohol to 
children. Non-supply appears to be the safest option 
(obvious in some ways), if the parental and societal aim 
is to protect the health of adolescents and young adults.
Our study has some limitations. Our cohort is not a 
random sample from the population but a group that 
agreed to participate, so the results might not be 
generalisable at a population level. However, our cohort 
is similar to the Australian population (parents and 
children) for major demographic and alcohol consumption 
measures, though populations of low socioeconomic 
status are under-represented.9 The measures of symptoms 
of abuse, dependence, and alcohol use disorder were 
self-completed by cohort participants. However, the levels 
of reported symptoms of abuse and dependence in this 
cohort are very similar to the levels of alcohol use disorders 
found in community samples of young adults in Australia26 
and other high-income countries.27,28 The dependence 
symptoms of tolerance and use of alcohol in larger 
amounts or for longer periods than intended had the 
highest endorsement rates, which is consistent with 
previous research.29 The current data should not be 
interpreted to mean that participants have an alcohol use 
disorder, but rather that there are emergent symptoms 
that could foreshadow alcohol use problems in the future.
Although we do not generalise the results to other 
cultures and settings, there remains no evidence from 
other countries that parental supply reduces risk. 
However, cultures and settings in which less consump-
tion is normal among young people could show different 
results,30 and might not show the increased risk seen in 
this study. Also, we could not account for child 
educational attainment or problems, as we could not 
gather nationally consistent measures on the participants. 
Finally, the analysis does not take into account the 
absolute amounts or the context of parental supply, but 
that was not our aim.
The 2016 Lancet Commission on adolescent health 
noted “Given that families and parents remain the most 
important figures in the lives of most adolescents, the 
paucity of rigorous research into family influences on 
adolescent health and wellbeing is a striking knowledge 
gap.”3 We agree; we found that parental provision of 
alcohol to their children is associated with subsequent 
binge drinking, alcohol related-harm(s), and symptoms 
of alcohol use disorder. There was no evidence of any 
benefit or protective effect, either directly (ie, no evidence 
that parental supply is associated with reduced risk of 
alcohol-related harms), or indirectly (ie, associated with 
lower risk of accessing alcohol from other sources). 
Parental supply is associated with increased risk of other 
supply, not the reverse.

While

(especially

high-income 
countries) focus upon prevention through enforcement 
of legal age of purchase legislation, and school-based 
education, a major stakeholder with excellent scale and 
penetration goes largely unnoticed—parents. Parents, 
policy makers, and clinicians need to be made aware that 
parental provision of alcohol is associated with risk, not 
with protection, to reduce the extent of parental supply 
in high-income countries, and in low-middle-income 
countries that are increasingly embracing the consump-
tion of alcoholic beverages.31
