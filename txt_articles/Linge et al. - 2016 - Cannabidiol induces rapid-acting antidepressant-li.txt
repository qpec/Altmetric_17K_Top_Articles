 Abstract 
Cannabidiol (CBD), the main non-psychomimetic component of marihuana, 
exhibits anxiolytic-like properties in many behavioural tests, although its potential 
for treating major depression has been poorly explored. Moreover, the 
mechanism of action of CBD remains unclear. Herein, we have evaluated CBD 
effects following acute and chronic administration in the olfactory bulbectomy 
mouse model of depression (OBX), and investigated the underlying mechanism. 
For this purpose, we conducted behavioural (open field and sucrose preference 
tests) and neurochemical (microdialysis and autoradiography of 5-HT1A receptor 
functionality) studies following CBD treatment. We also assayed the 
pharmacological antagonism of CBD effects to dissect out the mechanism of 
action. Our results demonstrate that CBD exerts fast and maintained 
antidepressant-like effects as evidenced by the reversal of the OBX-induced 
hyperactivity and anhedonia. In vivo microdialysis revealed that CBD 
administration significantly enhanced serotonin and glutamate release in 
vmPFCx in a different manner depending on the emotional state and the duration 
of the treatment. The potentiating effect upon neurotransmitters release occurring 
immediately after the first injection of CBD might underlie the fast antidepressant-
like actions in OBX mice. Both antidepressant-like effect and enhanced 5-
HT/glutamate cortical release induced by CBD were prevented by 5-HT1A 
receptor blockade. Moreover, adaptive changes in pre- and post-synaptic 5-HT1A 
receptor functionality were also found after chronic CBD. In conclusion, our 
findings indicate that CBD could represent a novel fast antidepressant drug, via 
enhancing both serotonergic and glutamate cortical signalling through a 5-HT1A 
receptor-dependent mechanism.

 1. Introduction 
Cannabinoid compounds have been used by different cultures to improve mood 
since ancient times. For this reason, the study of the endocannabinoid system 
and cannabinoid derivatives has gained a great interest in anxiety/depression 
research (Bambico et al., 2007; Hill and Gorzalka, 2005; McLaughlin et al., 2007; 
Shearman et al., 2003).  
In this regard, cannabidiol (CBD), the main non-psychomimetic component of 
marihuana, has shown anxiolytic properties both in humans and rodents 
(Bergamaschi et al., 2011; Guimaraes et al., 1990) after acute or chronic 
administration (Campos and Guimaraes, 2008; Campos et al., 2013b; Resstel et 
al., 2009). Nevertheless, little is known about its potential for treating depression. 
It was proposed as a putative novel antidepressant as it displayed positive 
responses in the forced swimming test (FST) (El-Alfy et al., 2010; Zanelati et al., 
2010) and also in the novelty suppressed feeding test (NSF) under chronic stress 
conditions (Campos et al., 2013b). Furthermore, CBD exerts a positive impact on 
some neuroplasticity markers of antidepressant effects, such as increased brain-
derived neurotrophic factor levels (Magen et al., 2010). It also restores the 
impaired neuroproliferation of chronically stressed animals (Campos et al., 
2013b), and presents anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects (Esposito 
et al., 2011; Malfait et al., 2000).  
The mechanism of action of CBD has been extensively scrutinized (McPartland 
et al., 2015). This multifaceted drug produces different pharmacological actions 
modulating several receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) (CB1, CB2, 5-
HT1A, TRPV1 and PPARγ receptors, among others) (Campos et al., 2013a; 
 Campos et al., 2013b; Casarotto et al., 2010; Costa et al., 2004; Do Monte et al., 
2013; Esposito et al., 2011; Pazos et al., 2013; Soares Vde et al., 2010; Thomas 
et al., 2007). Given the crosstalk among systems involved in mood control, the 
ability of CBD to modulate some of them, could result advantageous for the 
treatment of such a complex disease as it is depression. Among all the above 
highlighted mechanisms, the CB1 and 5-HT1A receptors seem to be the most 
strongly implicated in CBD mood regulatory effects. CBD has been reported to 
act as an antagonist/inverse agonist of CB1 receptors (Thomas et al., 2007) and 
also to increase anandamide (AEA) levels (Bisogno et al., 2001; Leweke et al., 
2012). It has been also shown to exert a positive allosteric modulation of 5-HT1A 
receptors rather than a direct agonism (Rock et al., 2012), a fact that could 
explain the unexpected key role of these serotonergic receptors in many CBD 
effects. Pharmacological approaches with selective receptor antagonists showed 
that the acute anxiolytic-like and panicolytic-like properties of CBD are 
predominantly mediated by 5-HT1A receptors (Campos et al., 2013a; Campos and 
Guimaraes, 2008; Resstel et al., 2009; Soares Vde et al., 2010; Zanelati et al., 
2010), whereas the anxiolytic-like effects induced by its chronic administration 
involving neurogenic actions, seem to be CB1-receptor dependent (Campos et 
al., 2013b).  
Classical antidepressants act through serotonergic potentiation whereas the 
effects of fast-acting agents seem to mediated by glutamatergic signalling (Du et 
al., 2006). However, there is scarce knowledge about the impact of CBD 
administration in serotonergic and glutamatergic pathways. In this regard, 5-HT1A 
receptor is expressed in dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) on 5-HTergic neurons and 
local GABAergic interneurons, where it controls 5-HT neuronal firing (Celada et 
 al., 2001). They are also located in cortical interneurons and pyramidal cells 
modulating neurotransmitters efflux (Santana et al., 2004). In addition, 
endocannabinoid system is also strongly implicated in the control of 5-HT and 
glutamate release at different locations (Bambico et al., 2007; Bisogno et al., 
2001; Brown et al., 2003; McLaughlin et al., 2012; Mendiguren and Pineda, 2009; 
Navarrete and Araque, 2008). Thus, the study of CBD effects upon these 
neurotransmitters release pattern would shed light on the mechanistic basis of 
CBD behavioural actions.  
Herein, we have evaluated the behavioural and neurochemical actions of CBD in 
the olfactory bulbectomy mouse model of depression (OBX) (Linge et al., 2013), 
since its efficacy as antidepressant under pathological conditions has not been 
proved yet. Firstly, we assayed the behavioural effects induced by acute and 
chronic administration of CBD, and in parallel we performed microdialysis studies 
to assess the CBD effects on the serotonin (5-HT) and glutamate release in the 
ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFCx), a pivotal area for the behavioural 
outcome depending on the emotional status. In addition, the functionality 
([35S]GTPγS autoradiography) of brain 5-HT1A receptors following chronic 
administration of CBD was analysed, given their role in the mechanism of action 
of antidepressants. Finally, pharmacological antagonism studies were performed 
to determine the receptor implicated in CBD behavioural and neurochemical 
outcomes. 
 
 
 
 2. Material and Methods  
2.1. Animals and OBX surgery 
Experiments were conducted with 3 month old male C57BL6 mice weighing 25–
30 g. All procedures were carried out with the previous approval of the Animal 
Care Committee of the University of Cantabria and according to the Spanish 
legislation (RD 53/2013) and the European Communities Council Directive 
(2010/63/UE) on “Protection of Animals Used in Experimental and Other 
Scientific Purposes. Animals were individually caged all throughout the study, 
housed in climate controlled rooms with 12 h light–12 h dark cycle, and provided 
with food and water ad libitum. 
The OBX and sham-operation (SHAM) procedure was performed as previously 
described (Linge et al., 2013) (Supplementary experimental procedures). After a 
4-week recovery period, treatments and experiments were performed using 
different sets of animals for each experimental procedure (Supplementary 
experimental procedures). All efforts were made to minimise animal suffering, to 
reduce the number of animals used, and to utilise alternatives to in vivo 
techniques, if available. 
2.2. Drugs and treatments  
(-)Cannabidiol, WAY100635 (WAY) and AM251 (AM) were dissolved in vehicle 
(VEH) (2% Tween 80®: 5% Propilenglycol®: saline).  
Acute and chronic administration studies were conducted to investigate the 
behavioural (open field and sucrose preference tests) and neurochemical 
(microdialysis studies and 5-HT1A receptor autoradiography) effects induced by 
 CBD (Supplementary experimental procedures). In the acute studies, the effect 
of CBD alone (50 mg/kg) or in combination with antagonists was assessed in the 
open field test and microdialysis studies (30 min post-administration; i.p.). 
Antagonists doses were those normally reported in the literature and devoid of 
any effect by themselves on the parameters analysed in the open field (WAY 0.3 
mg/kg, AM251 0.3 mg/kg). In the chronic treatment, CBD was administered for 
14 days following a drug regime (50 mg/kg/day for 3 days + 10 mg/kg/day until 
the end of treatment; i.p.) that was selected after preliminary assays. After 2 
weeks CBD treatment, animals were sacrificed and brain samples collected and 
stored at -80°C for the autoradiographic studies.  
2.3. Behavioural testing (Supplementary experimental procedures) 
Open field test (OFT): we evaluated CBD effects on the OBX-induced 
hyperactivity (to assess antidepressant-like effects) and central ambulation (to 
assess anxiolytic-like effects) (Linge et al., 2013). Both the acute effects (30 min 
post-injection) and persistent actions (24 hours post-injection in the chronic study 
after 1, 3, 7 and 14 days of treatment) were evaluated.   
Sucrose preference test: OBX-mice anhedonia was assessed in the sucrose 
preference test to check depressive-like behaviour and antidepressant-like 
actions. A choice of sucrose (1%) and water solutions were provided in the home 
cage and the consumption was quantified (Linge et al., 2013). 
2.4. Microdialysis studies 
Concentric dialysis probes were implanted in the vmPFCx. Microdialysis 
experiments were conducted 24 h after surgery in freely moving mice by 
continuously perfusing probes. After a 180 min stabilization period, six 20-min 
 fractions were collected to obtain basal values and another six samples after the 
i.p. administration of drugs. 5-HT and glutamate were determined by high-
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Supplementary experimental 
procedures). 
2.5. [35S]GTPγS autoradiography of 5-HT1A receptor functionality  
[35S]GTPγS autoradiography in coronal brain sections was carried out as 
previously described (Sim et al., 1995), using 10 µM (±)8-OH-DPAT for stimulated 
condition. Autoradiographic values of net agonist-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding 
were calculated by subtracting basal binding from agonist-stimulated binding. 
Data are expressed as percentage of agonist-stimulated binding over basal 
activity (100%) (Supplementary experimental procedures). 
2.6. Data analysis 
All the values are expressed as mean ± standard error of mean (S.E.M). For the 
behavioural and autoradiographic studies, the data were statistically analysed by 
one/two-way ANOVA (surgery and treatment as main factors), and for the 
microdialysis studies two-way repeated measures ANOVA were conducted to 
check the possible interaction among surgery, treatment and time. A Student-
Newman-Keuls test was applied for the post-hoc analysis. GraphPad Prism 5.01 
(San Diego, CA, USA) and Statistica 8 (Statsoft, Inc., Tulsa, USA) were used for 
the statistical analysis. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant. 
 
 3. Results 
Different regimes of administration were initially assayed to choose the most 
appropriate. The first dose of CBD evaluated (10 mg/kg/day, i.p.) produced a 
significant reversal of OBX-induced hyperactivity after 2 weeks of treatment 
(Supplementary Fig. S1). As shown later (section 3.1.2; fig B.1), a higher dose of 
CBD (50 mg/kg/day, i.p.) induced sustained hyperactivity reversal from the first 
injection but it significantly decreased sucrose consumption in half of sham 
animals, and a trend was observed in OBX mice (Supplementary Fig. S2.a). This 
behavioural outcome was accompanied by a reduction in food intake 
(Supplementary Fig. S2.b) and body weight (Supplementary Fig. S2.c), reflecting 
an anorectic effect of CBD that would explain such decreased sucrose 
preference. Therefore, a regime combining both doses (50 mg/kg for 3 days + 10 
mg/kg until the end of treatment) was chosen as appropriate for achieving fast 
onset of antidepressant-like actions, and avoiding the interference of the 
anorectic actions.

OBX mice  
3.1.1. Acute antidepressant-like and anxiolytic-like effects of CBD in the 
open-field test 
The acute effect of CBD (50 mg/kg; 30 min post-injection) was evaluated in the 
open field test. Regarding total distance travelled, two-way ANOVA revealed a 
significant interaction between surgery and treatment [F(1,22) =6.80, p < 0.05]. 
Post-hoc comparison indicated that CBD significantly reversed OBX-induced 
 hyperactivity (p < 0.01; Fig. A.1). Acute CBD also increased central ambulation 
of OBX mice, as reflected in the higher percentage of distance travelled in the 
central zone (p < 0.05; Fig. A.2). CBD did not alter locomotor activity or central 
ambulation in sham animals.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure A. Acute effect of CBD in the open field test. Acute CBD (50 mg/k; i.p.) significantly 
reversed both OBX-induced hyperactivity (A.1) and decreased central ambulation (A.2) 30 min 
post-injection and it was devoid of any behavioural effect in sham counterparts. Data represented 
as mean ± SEM, n= 6-7 mice per experimental group (*p < 0.05 and ***p < 0.001 vs. SHAM VEH; 
#p < 0.05 and ##p < 0.01 vs. OBX VEH).  
 
3.1.2. Time-course antidepressant-like effects of CBD administration  
Open field test 
As shown in figure B.1, CBD reversal of OBX-hyperactivity was still present 
twenty-four hours after the first injection (OBX VEH vs. OBX CBD, p < 0.001). 
Moreover, this hyperactivity attenuation was still measured throughout the CBD 
treatment assessed 24h post 3 (p < 0.01), 7 (p < 0.001) and 14 (p < 0.01) days

=5.68, p < 0.05] for day 14). Interestingly, CBD did not alter sham animals 
locomotor activity.  
Regarding central activity, the anxiolytic-like effect of CBD observed immediately 
after the first injection was not significantly preserved 24 hours later or thereafter 
(Supplementary Fig. S3).  
Sucrose preference test 
Two-way ANOVA analysis revealed a significant interaction between surgery and 
treatment ([F(1,27) = 4.30, p < 0.05] after 7 days of CBD treatment. As shown in 
figure B.2, OBX animals exhibited anhedonia, as reflected by a lower preference 
for sucrose solutions than their sham counterparts (p < 0.01). The sucrose intake 
of OBX-mice was totally restored after one week CBD treatment (p < 0.01) and 
two weeks (data not shown). At the same time points sham mice did not exhibit 
any alteration in the sucrose preference.

3.2. Differential effects of acute and chronic CBD upon 5-HT and glutamate 
release in ventro-medial prefrontal cortex   
In order to explore the underpinning mechanism of CBD fast antidepressant-like 
actions, we firstly evaluated the acute effect of a single dose of CBD (50 mg /kg; 
i.p.) upon the release of 5-HT and glutamate in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex 
(vmPFCx) of sham and OBX-mice. Then, the effect of a challenge dose of CBD 
after a 14 days treatment was also assessed in sham and OBX mice, to analyse 
the possible adaptive changes induced by its chronic administration.

 3.2.1. Acute CBD effects 
In vivo microdialysis studies showed that acute administration of 50 mg/kg CBD 
prompted a significant increase in extracellular 5-HT contents in the vmPFCx of 
OBX-mice (p < 0.05 vs. OBX VEH), but not in sham counterparts (Fig. C.1). In 
addition, CBD increased extracellular glutamate levels in both sham (p < 0.01) 
and OBX (p < 0.01) animals (Fig. C.2).  
3.2.2. Chronic effects of CBD 
Microdialysis studies after chronic CBD administration demonstrated alterations 
in the pattern of neurotransmitters release, compared to the effects of a single 
CBD injection. After chronic administration, a CBD challenge dose induced a 
significant augmentation of extracellular 5-HT in all CBD-treated animals (SHAM 
CBD p < 0.01; OBX CBD p < 0.05) vs. vehicle-treated groups (Fig. C.3). However, 
the glutamate release was only increased in OBX-mice (p < 0.01; Fig C.4) since 
the sham counterparts treated with chronic CBD did not retain the response 
observed after acute CBD administration.  
The analysis of the absolute basal neurotransmitter levels after chronic CBD 
administration revealed a significant elevation in glutamate contents in all CBD 
treated mice (Fig. C.6), more pronounced in the sham group  (OBX CBD vs. OBX 
VEH p < 0.05, SHAM CBD vs. SHAM VEH p < 0.01). No significant differences 
were obtained in the 5-HT absolute basal levels analysis (Fig. C.5).

animals per experimental group (**p < 0.01 vs. SHAM VEH; #p < 0.05 and ##p < 0.01 vs. OBX

3.3. Chronic CBD induces differential adaptive changes on 5-HT1A receptor 
functionality in OBX and sham mice  
As shown in figure D, densitometric analysis revealed a decrease in (±)8-(OH)-
DPAT-induced stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding in the DRN of OBX mice (-22 ± 
4 % vs. SHAM VEH, p < 0.05), that was normalized after chronic CBD treatment 
(OBX CBD vs. OBX VEH, p < 0.05). A significant interaction between surgery and 
treatment was found in DRN [F(1,23) = 5.55, p < 0.05].  
A decrease in the stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding in OBX mice was also observed 
in postsynaptic areas such as amygdala (AMY: -30 ± 2 %, p < 0.01) and CA1-
CA2 fields of the hippocampus (CA1-CA2: -89 ± 14 %, p < 0.05) compared to 
SHAM VEH group.  Chronic CBD administration significantly reversed (±)8-(OH)-
DPAT-induced stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding in both structures in OBX mice 
(OBX CBD vs. OBX VEH, p < 0.05 for both areas). Two-way ANOVA analysis 
revealed a significant interaction between surgery and treatment in CA1-CA2 
[F(1,29) = 5.37, p < 0.05]. 
In mPFCx, no changes were detected between sham and OBX mice. However, 
CBD administration induced an increase in the stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding in 
 both sham (SHAM CBD: + 42 ± 12 %, p < 0.01 vs. SHAM VEH) and OBX (OBX 
CBD: + 40 ± 7, p < 0.01 vs. OBX VEH) mice. 
Figure D. Box and whiskers plot of 5-HT1A receptors functionality in different brain areas 
after chronic CBD administration. A decreased (±)8-(OH)-DPAT stimulated [35S]GTPγS 
binding was measured in DRN, CA1-CA2, and AMY in OBX mice compared with sham animals. 
This impaired 5-HT1A receptor functionality in OBX-mice was restored after chronic CBD 
administration. A higher (±)8-(OH)-DPAT stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding was detected in the 
mPFCx in all CBD-treated mice. Results are expressed as percentage of [35S]GTPγS binding 
stimulation over basal values, as mean ± minimum/maximum of n= 6-9  mice per experimental 
group (*p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01 vs. SHAM VEH; #p < 0.05 and ##p < 0.01 vs. OBX VEH).

 3.4. 5-HT1A receptor plays a key role in the behavioural and neurochemical 
effects of CBD 
3.4.1. Fast effects of CBD in the OFT are mediated by 5-HT1A receptors 
Selective antagonists of either 5-HT1A or CB1-receptors were used to investigate 
the neurochemical mechanisms underlying acute effects of CBD in the OBX-
induced behaviour. Antagonists of 5-HT1A (WAY100635, 0.3 mg/kg; i.p.) and CB1 
(AM251, 0.3 mg/kg; i.p.) receptors were coadministered with CBD (50 mg/kg; i.p.) 
30 min before the OFT session. Antagonists doses were those normally reported 
in the literature and devoid of any effect by themselves on the parameters 
analysed in the open field. Interestingly, WAY100635 was able to prevent the 
CBD-induced reversal of OBX-hyperactivity (OBX CBD vs. OBX CBD+WAY, p < 
0.01) (Fig. E.1). It also inhibited the beneficial effect of CBD on central ambulation 
scores in these subjects (OBX CBD vs. OBX CBD+WAY, p < 0.05) (Fig. E.2), not 
altering sham mice activity (data not shown). By contrast, AM251 did not 
counteract nor mimic the behavioural effects of CBD in OBX animals (Fig. E.1 
and 2).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure E. Behavioural effects of acute CBD in OBX mice were prevented by 5-HT1A receptor 
blockade. In the open field test, WAY100635 (0.3 mg/kg; i.p) prevented both the reversal of OBX-
hyperactivity (E.1) and the increase of central activity (E.2) induced by CBD (50 mg/kg). By 
contrast the selective CB1 receptor antagonist AM251 (0.3 mg/kg; i.p.) did not counteract any of 
these effects. Data represented as mean ± SEM of n=5-7 animals per experimental group (*p < 
0.05 vs. vehicle-treated group; #p < 0.05 and ##p < 0.01 vs. CBD-treated group). 
 
3.4.2. 5-HT1A receptor blockade prevented the increase in 5-HT and 
glutamate cortical release induced by CBD  
Since the 5-HT1A receptor blockade abolished the behavioural actions of acute 
CBD in the open field, we studied the effect of WAY100635 upon the CBD-
induced release of 5-HT and glutamate.  
Administration of WAY100635 (0.3 mg/kg) prevented the 5-HT outflow induced 
by acute CBD administration in OBX animals (p < 0.05 vs. OBX CBD) (Fig. F.1). 
In sham animals, where CBD alone did not induce any change in 5-HT release, 
the blockade of 5-HT1A receptors resulted in a significant increase of 5-HT efflux 
(p < 0.01 vs. SHAM CBD) (Fig. F.2). Additionally, WAY100635 blocked the

4. Discussion 
In this paper we demonstrate for the first time that CBD exerts rapid 
antidepressant-like effects as evidenced by the reversal of OBX-induced 
hyperactivity immediately after the first injection. Moreover, its efficacy is 
maintained and improved with the repeated administration, as the anhedonia was 
completely relieved after one week of treatment. The dose adjustment appears 
to be particularly important for the fast antidepressant effects. Hence, we found 
that 10 mg/kg of CBD exerts antidepressant-like actions after two weeks of 
treatment. Nevertheless, when a higher dose is administered at the beginning of 
the treatment (50 mg/kg), the reversal of OBX-hyperactivity is evident from the 
first injection and the anti-anhedonic effect appears after just one week 
administration.  
Regarding anxiety-related behaviours, CBD also exhibited acute anxiolytic-like 
effects in OBX mice, in agreement with other authors’ reports (Guimaraes et al., 
1990; Moreira et al., 2006; Resstel et al., 2006; Casarotto et al., 2010). However, 
we did not detect any anxiolytic effect of CBD administration in sham-control 
mice, and neither anxiogenic-like effects (ElBatsh et al., 2012; Fogaca et al., 
2014). This discrepancy could be due to methodological differences related with 
housing conditions (Linge, Pazos et al. 2013), drug administration regime and 
dosage (acute vs chronic), and contextual issues influencing behavioural 
 outcomes. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the antidepressant efficacy of 
CBD in OBX mice, an animal model of depression with comorbid anxiety –face 
validity– and extensively used for the preclinical research of antidepressant and 
anxiolytic effects of drugs –predictive validity– (Song and Leonard, 2005). Even 
more, CBD does not only show an earlier onset of action compared to classic 
antidepressants (Rodriguez-Gaztelumendi et al., 2009), but also triggers an 
immediate antidepressant-like effect, similarly to that reported for ketamine (Li et 
al., 2010; Maeng et al., 2008).  
In our study, the initial high dose of CBD (50 mg/kg) reduced sucrose preference 
in some sham animals in parallel with a decline in food consumption and body 
weight. It is possible that CBD acting as a CB1 receptor antagonist (Thomas et 
al., 2007) could promote anorectic effects as reported for CB1 antagonist/inverse 
agonists like Rimonabant or AM251 (Colombo et al., 1998; Shearman et al., 
2003). Therefore, we assumed that this initial decrease in sucrose consumption 
is likely caused by an alteration of the appetite rather than to an emotional 
detriment, since the parallel behavioural assessment revealed an improved 
emotional response of OBX mice and no decline in sham animals after CBD 
administration. All the above behavioural findings reinforce the need of adequate 
pharmacological strategies to optimize the benefits of CBD treatment (McCarberg 
and Barkin, 2007). 
In order to analyse the concurrent neurochemical events that may account for the 
behavioural benefits of CBD, microdialysis studies in vmPFCx were performed 
after acute and chronic administration. PFCx is a key area in the maladaptive 
behavioural regulation (Davidson, 2002), specifically exhibited by depressed 
individuals and a typical feature of OBX mice (Fitzgerald et al., 2008; Song and 
 Leonard, 2005). Interestingly, acute CBD induced an increase in cortical 5-HT 
levels only in OBX animals, a finding that could explain the differential behavioural 
effects of CBD under physiological or pathological conditions. We found a 
decreased functionality of somatodendritic 5-HT1A receptors in the DRN of OBX 
animals similarly to that described for depressed suicide patients (Savitz et al., 
2009). Consequently, this lower inhibitory tone onto the DRN firing would drive 
an increased 5-HT efflux in the projection areas (Casanovas et al., 1999; Celada 
et al., 2001), when CBD is administered acutely to OBX mice but not to sham 
counterparts. Accordingly, we detected an increased cortical 5-HT release in 
sham mice after CBD only when 5-HT1A receptors were blocked by an antagonist 
administration. 
5-HT augmentation in mPFCx has been described after chronic (Gardier et al., 
1996) but not acute (Beyer et al., 2002) administration of antidepressants, and it 
has been pointed as the main underpinning mechanism for their behavioural 
actions, together with adaptive changes in the serotonergic system. Following 
chronic CBD administration a challenge dose induced 5-HT efflux in the vmPFCx 
although in this case in both OBX and sham animals, likely indicating the 
occurrence of adaptive changes in serotonergic system. In this sense, chronic 
CBD promoted an increase in postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors functionality in 
mPFCx, not only in OBX but also in sham mice, as it occurs with SSRIs (Matsuda, 
2013). Concomitantly, we expected to find a decreased functionality of 
somatodendritic DRN 5-HT1A receptors of sham animals, that justified the 
increased 5-HT efflux induced by chronic CBD, but we did not observe any 
alteration. However, it should be noted that somatodendritic 5-HT1A receptors 
desensitization is not always detectable by [35S]GTPγS binding techniques (Gi-
 proteins coupling to the receptor) but with other methodological approaches (e.g. 
5-HT1A receptor-mediated GIRK currents electrophysiology) (Rossi et al., 2006). 
In any case, we did not find behavioural changes associated to the increased 5-
HT efflux induced by chronic CBD observed in sham mice, though other 
predictive paradigms may provide valuable information. On the other hand, OBX 
animals exhibited impaired functionality of 5-HT1A receptors in limbic brain areas 
(i.e. amygdala and hippocampus) that were restored after chronic CBD treatment. 
This effect might be associated to the increased 5-HT efflux and improvement of 
behavioural deficits, suggesting a crucial role of these receptors in the 
pharmacodynamics of CBD.  
Microdialysis in vmPFCx revealed that acute CBD promoted a marked glutamate 
elevation in both sham and OBX mice. This facilitated glutamatergic 
neurotransmission has been associated with the fast antidepressant efficacy of 
ketamine (Maeng et al., 2008). Thus, it could be postulated that the increased 
glutamate efflux triggered by CBD from the first injection could underlie the fast 
antidepressant-like effects of CBD in OBX. In the chronic approach, the increase 
of glutamate efflux induced by CBD was observed only in OBX mice. It is 
noteworthy that after the chronic CBD treatment, basal levels of glutamate were 
elevated in both sham and OBX mice, though in a lower magnitude in the OBX 
group. This finding could explain the lack of relative glutamate increment in sham 
animals after a challenge dose of CBD. A minor basal glutamatergic tone of OBX 
animals after chronic CBD treatment compared with sham mice, could be related 
to a dysfunction in glutamatergic system previously described in OBX animals 
(Webster et al., 2000) and also in depressed patients (Hashimoto, 2009).  
 To gather more information about CBD mechanism of action in behavioural 
responses, we analysed the implication of the two main targets of this compound, 
5-HT1A and CB1 receptors (Fernandez-Ruiz et al., 2013). Our findings revealed a 
crucial role of 5-HT1A receptors in the behavioural effects of CBD, since 
WAY100635 but not AM251, prevented both the reversal of OBX-hyperactivity 
and the anxiolytic-like effects displayed by CBD. These findings are in good 
agreement with studies in which CBD decreased immobility in the FST (Zanelati 
et al., 2010) and prevented anxiety/panic responses (Campos et al., 2013a; 
Campos and Guimaraes, 2008; Fogaca et al., 2014; Soares Vde et al., 2010) in 
a 5-HT1A receptor-dependent manner. However, it has been also described that 
some acute and chronic anxiolytic-like effects of CBD are mediated by CB1 
receptors (Campos et al., 2013b; Casarotto et al., 2010; Do Monte et al., 2013). 
As anxiety is a complex syndrome affected by different brain processes 
(Davidson, 2002; Kheirbek et al., 2012), these two receptors could be implicated 
in the anxiety outcome at different levels. Nevertheless, the behavioural 
antidepressant-like effects of CBD were neither prevented nor mimicked by 
AM251, suggesting that the endocannabinoid system modulation is not 
contributing to CBD fast antidepressant-like effects. Accordingly, we postulated 
that CBD could induce 5-HT/glutamate release in vmPFCx through a 5-HT1A 
receptor-dependent mechanism, responsible of its fast antidepressant-like 
effects. Microdialysis studies confirmed our hypothesis since not only 5-HT but 
also glutamate increase induced by CBD were prevented by WAY100635. 
Altogether, our findings demonstrate a 5-HT1A-dependent enhancement of 
glutamatergic and serotonergic neurotransmission in OBX mice immediately after 
the first injection of CBD could lie behind its fast antidepressant-like effects. 
 Likewise, the sustained increase in prefrontocortical glutamate contents, together 
with serotonergic increase and the adaptive changes in 5-HT1A receptor 
functionality, might drive the consolidation and improvement of the 
antidepressant-like effects of chronic CBD (including anti-anhedonic actions).  
Although further investigation is still required to fully elucidate how CBD acts on 
5-HT1A receptors to induce the boost of 5-HT and glutamate, we are proposing a 
putative neurochemical mechanism (Fig. G). Both serotonergic and glutamatergic 
potentiation, through the allosteric modulation of the 5-HT1A receptor (Rock et al., 
2012), might underlie fast antidepressant-like effects of CBD in the OBX model 
of depression. In prefrontal cortex, CBD would potentiate the inhibitory function 
of 5-HT1A receptors upon GABAergic interneurons (Santana et al., 2004), 
favouring glutamate signalling in postsynaptic areas (Llado-Pelfort et al., 2012). 
This enhanced glutamatergic transmission, through pyramidal descending 
projections to DRN, might stimulate the neuronal firing of serotonergic neurons, 
driving to a 5-HT increase in mPFCx (Celada et al., 2001). In DRN, CBD could 
reduce the inhibitory effect GABAergic interneurons upon the discharge rate of 
serotonergic neurons, contributing to the increased cortical serotonergic output. 
The concurrent activation of somatodendritic 5-HT1A receptors is known to inhibit 
the firing rate of DRN 5-HT neurons. The decreased functionality of these 
presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors in DRN of OBX mice might explain the higher 5-HT 
release in mPFCx after CBD due to a lower inhibitory feedback. Finally, increased 
serotonin efflux in mPFCx of OBX mice after CBD might also modulate pyramidal 
neurons activity through the activation of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A membrane 
receptors. 
 Although the herein proposed mechanism for CBD seems to be the most feasible 
accounting for our results, we do not discard the additional involvement of other 
receptors and/or the crosstalk among systems in the overall observed effects. In 
all, CBD is a multitarget drug that can modulate a variety of systems implicated 
in mood control and therefore, result in a great value from a clinical point of view. 
 
 
Figure G. Proposed neurochemical mechanism of action of CBD to induce fast 
antidepressant effects. In prefrontal cortex, CBD would potentiate the inhibitory function of 5-
HT1A receptors upon GABAergic interneurons, favouring glutamate signalling in postsynaptic 
areas, the stimulation of pyramidal descending projections to DRN, and therefore the neuronal 
firing of serotonergic neurons, and the 5-HT increase in mPFCx. In DRN, CBD would increase 5-
HT neurons firing by reducing the inhibitory effect of GABAergic interneurons, but on the other it 
would decrease de 5-HT neuron firing potentiating the inhibitory control of local 5-HT1A receptors. 
The decreased functionality of presynaptic somatodendritic 5-HT1A receptors in OBX mice would 
explain the higher 5-HT release in PFCx.  
 
 
 Conclusions 
This work evidences that CBD could represent a novel drug for treating 
depressive disorders in a very fast manner, acting by the enhancement of 
serotonergic and glutamatergic transmission through a 5-HT1A receptors 
modulation. The fast onset of antidepressant action of CBD and the simultaneous 
anxiolytic effect would solve some of the main limitations of the current 
antidepressant therapies. Furthermore, the broad range for therapeutic dosage 
and the lack of psychotomimetic effects confers to this drug fundamental 
advantage for its use in clinical practice comparing to other fast-acting 
antidepressant alternatives. Finally, this novel strategy consisting in the dual 
potentiation of serotonergic and glutamatergic transmission could bring new light 
to the discovery of new fast and effective antidepressant therapies.

 Supplementary Experimental Procedures  
Olfactory bulbectomy 
The OB procedure was performed as previously described (Linge et al., 
2013).Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (2%; Schering Plough, United 
Kingdom) to perform the bilateral olfactory bulbectomy. In brief, the head was 
shaven and a midline sagital incision was made in the skin overlying the skull. A 
burr hole was drilled through which both olfactory bulbs were bilaterally aspired 
by a suction pump. Finally, the hole was filled with bone wax in order to avoid 
further bleeding. After bulbectomy/sham surgery, a four week period was awaited 
in order that mice recovered and the OBX syndrome was developed. At the end 
of the study, animals were sacrificed and the lesions were verified to discard 
frontal pole lesions and/or incomplete removal of olfactory bulbs. Sham 
operations were done in the same way, although the bulbs were left intact.  
 
Experimental schedule and pharmacological treatments 
All the drugs ((-)Cannabidiol, WAY100635 and AM251) were purchased from 
TOCRIS (Bristol, United Kingdom), and were administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) 
dissolved in  vehicle (2% Tween80®: Propilenglycol® 5%: saline). 
Acute behavioural effects of CBD alone (50 mg/kg) or in combination with 
antagonists were assessed in the open field (30 min post-administration; i.p). 5-
HT1A-receptor (WAY100635, 0.3 mg/kg) and CB1-receptor (AM251, 0.3 mg/kg) 
antagonists were used. For the chronic studies, CBD or vehicle were 
administered daily during 14 days (i.p.; once a day) and open field sessions were 
 carried out 24 hours after the last injection, at different time-points along the 
chronic administration (after 1, 3, 7, and 14 days of treatment).  
Different doses and regimes of administration were tested to choose the most 
appropriate: a) 10 mg/kg (Supplementary Fig.S1); b) 50 mg/kg (Supplementary 
Fig. S2); and c) a combination. Finally, the 50 mg/kg dose was selected as the 
initial dose for the first 3 days followed by a 10 mg/kg dose for the remaining time. 
At the end of the 2 week CBD treatment, animals were sacrificed and brain 
samples were collected and stored at -80°C for the autoradiographic studies.  
 
In the microdialysis studies, the acute effects of CBD alone or in combination with 
WAY100635 (0.3 mg/kg) upon the release of 5-HT and glutamate in the medial 
prefrontal cortex were analysed. For chronic studies, the effect of a challenge 
dose of CBD was assessed after 2 weeks of treatment, in order to analyse the 
possible adaptive changes induced by its chronic administration.

 Behavioural testing 
Open field test 
The open field test was performed during the light phase and animals were 
transported to the experimental room at least 30 min before the start of each 
experiment to acclimatize. The open field apparatus was a brightly lit (350 lx) 
white wooden box (50 cm × 50 cm × 30 cm) with white floor and bright walls. Mice 
were released in the center of the apparatus for 5 min, and behaviour was video-
tracked by a computerized system (Any-maze Video-Tracking software, Stoelting 
Co., U.S.A.). Total distance travelled and percentage of distance travelled in the 
centre (30 cm × 30 cm) was evaluated. 
Sucrose preference test   
Sucrose (1%; Scharlau Chemie S.A., Spain) was dissolved in drinking water and 
animals were trained to drink sucrose and water solutions in their home cage ad 
libitum during 2 days, measuring the total fluid consumption per day previous to 
the test. Then the amount of sucrose and water consumed was registered with a 
time interval of 24 hours. The percentage of sucrose consumed by each animal 
was calculated and the mean sucrose intake of each experimental group was 
compared.  
 
Microdialysis studies 
Concentric dialysis probes with a 4-mm membrane length were implanted under 
sodium pentobarbital anaesthesia (60 mg/kg i.p.) in the vmPFC (AP +2.2 mm, L 
±0.2 mm, DV -3.4 mm; from bregma), according to Paxinos and Franklin (Paxinos 
 and Franklin, 2001). Microdialysis experiments were conducted 24 h after surgery 
in freely moving mice by continuously perfusing probes with artificial 
cerebrospinal fluid (125 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.26 mM CaCl2, 1.18 mM MgCl2, 
and 1 μM citalopram) at a rate of 1.5 μl/min. After a 180 min stabilization period, 
dialysate samples of 30 μl were collected every 20 min, six 20-min fractions were 
collected to obtain basal values (expressed as concentration of neurotransmitter 
in 30 µl sample) and another six samples after the i.p. administration of drugs. 5-
HT and glutamate were determined by HPLC as previously described (Lopez-Gil 
et al., 2007). At the completion of dialysis experiments, mice were sacrificed and 
a fast green solution was perfused through the dialysis probes to stain the 
surrounding tissue for subsequent histological examination. The amount of 
neurotransmitter release (% vs. basal) was determined at every time point for 
each animal and the mean of the experimental groups was compared for 5-HT 
and glutamate contents. The absolute basal levels of 5-HT (fmol/sample) and 
glutamate (pmol/sample) after the chronic approach were also compared among 
groups. At the completion of the experiments, mice were sacrificed and brain 
tissue was processed according to standard procedures (cresyl violet staining) to 
verify the correct placement of dialysis probe. 
 
[35S]GTPγS autoradiography of brain 5-HT1A receptors functionality  
At the end of chronic CBD treatment and after behavioural evaluation, animals 
were left for a 24 hours wash-out period and then sacrificed. Brains were obtained 
and stored at -80°C. Coronal brain sections (20 µm) were cut at -20°C using a 
microtome cryostat and thaw-mounted in Superfrost®Plus slides (Thermo Fisher 
 Scientific, USA) and stored at -80°C until use. [35S]GTPγS autoradiography was 
carried out as previously described (Sim et al., 1995). Slide-mounted sections 
were preincubated for 30 min at room temperature in buffer containing 50 mM 
Tris–HCl, 0.2 mM EGTA, 3 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DL-dithiothreitol and 
2 mM GDP (pH 7.7). Slides were subsequently incubated for 2 h in the same 
buffer containing adenosine deaminase (10 mU/ml) with [35S]GTPγS (0.04 nM; 
Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA). Consecutive sections were incubated in the 
absence (basal [35S]GTPγS binding) and in the presence of 10 µM (±)8-OH-DPAT 
(Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA) (5-HT1A receptor mediated stimulation of 
[35S]GTPγS binding); non-specific binding was determined in the absence of 
agonist and in the presence of guanosine-5-O-(3-thio)-triphosphate (GTPγS, 10 
µM, Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA). After the incubation, the sections were 
washed twice for 15 min in cold 50 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.4) at 4ºC, rinsed in 
distilled cold water and then dried under a cold air stream. These sections were 
exposed to autoradiographic films Biomax MR films (GE Healthcare, Madrid, 
Spain) together with [14C] microscales (GE Healthcare, Madrid, Spain) at 4ºC for 
2 days. Autoradiographic densities were determined by densitometry using Scion 
Image software (Scion Corporation, MD, USA). Density values were obtained and 
measured as nCi/g of tissue. Autoradiographic values of net agonist-stimulated 
[35S]GTPγS binding were calculated by subtracting basal binding from agonist-
stimulated binding and the data are expressed as percentage of agonist-
stimulated binding over basal activity (100%).
