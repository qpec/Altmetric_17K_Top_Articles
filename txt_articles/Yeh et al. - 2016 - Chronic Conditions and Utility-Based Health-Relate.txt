Abstract
Health utility, a summary measure of quality of life, has not been previously used to compare outcomes among childhood
cancer survivors and individuals without a cancer history. We estimated health utility (0, death; 1, perfect health) using the
Short Form-6D (SF-6D) in survivors (n ¼ 7105) and siblings of survivors (n ¼ 372) (using the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study
cohort) and the general population (n ¼ 12 803) (using the Medical Expenditures Panel Survey). Survivors had statistically
significantly lower SF-6D scores than the general population (mean ¼ 0.769, 95% confidence interval [CI] ¼ 0.766 to 0.771, vs
mean ¼ 0.809, 95% CI ¼ 0.806 to 0.813, respectively, P < .001, two-sided). Young adult survivors (age 18-29 years) reported
scores comparable with general population estimates for people age 40 to 49 years. Among survivors, SF-6D scores were
largely determined by number and severity of chronic conditions. No clinically meaningful differences were identified
between siblings and the general population (mean ¼ 0.793, 95% CI ¼ 0.782 to 0.805, vs mean ¼ 0.809, 95% CI ¼ 0.806 to 0.813,
respectively). This analysis illustrates the importance of chronic conditions on long-term survivor quality of life and provides
encouraging results on sibling well-being. Preference-based utilities are informative tools for outcomes research in cancer
survivors.
Health utility is a summary measure of health-related quality of
life, estimated using preference or desirability for living in a par-
ticular state of health compared with other states of health or
death. While generally used to calculate quality-adjusted life
expectancy in cost-effectiveness studies, utilities also provide
informative estimates of quality of life as an outcome (1). To
date, this approach has not been used to quantify the impact of
cancer treatment–related toxicity in long-term adult survivors
of childhood cancer. Expressed on a standardized scale, in
which 0 represents death and 1.0 represents perfect health, util-
ity measures allow comparisons of quality-of-life outcomes be-
tween patient groups (eg, cancer patients vs HIV patients) and
the general US population.
Over 83% of children diagnosed with cancer today will be-
come five-year survivors (2). Despite this remarkable achieve-
ment, 40% of childhood cancer survivors face disabling, severe
or life-threatening conditions that threaten to undermine their
initial cancer success (3). The burden of childhood cancer may
also impact siblings who experience emotional distress and di-
minished parental attention because of caregiving demands (4).
Better quantifying the impact of treatment-related toxicity can
help identify high-risk groups for interventions that may im-
prove survivor health and well-being, as well as inform the
treatment choices for newly diagnosed children.
We estimated health utility scores for childhood cancer survi-
vor (n¼ 7105) and sibling (n ¼ 372) participants in the Childhood

 Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) and used the Medical Expenditures
Panel Survey (MEPS) as the population comparator (n¼ 12 803).
The CCSS is a multi-institutional, retrospective cohort of more
than 14 000 five-year survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed be-
fore the age of 21 years between 1970 and 1986 and approxi-
mately 4000 siblings (5–8); the cohort is followed prospectively to
document the development of largely self-reported chronic con-
ditions. MEPS is a nationally representative survey of the US non-
institutionalized civilian population age 18 years and older (see
Supplementary Materials, available online, for additional details)
(9). Both the CCSS and MEPS collected health status data in 2003
that allowed for the calculation of health utilities via a common
metric, the Short Form-6D (SF-6D) (10,11).
We estimated SF-6D utilities for the entire survivor and sib-
ling samples and within sex- and age-specific groups. Among
the survivors, we estimated utilities within each original cancer
diagnosis group by treatment exposure and by chronic condi-
tions reported in follow-up. Chronic conditions were classified
by severity using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events (CTCAE version 4.03) (12). We assessed differences in
health utility across groups by comparing mean values (using
Welch’s two-sided t test) and used multivariable linear regres-
sion based on a stepwise selection approach to determine the
influence of original cancer, treatment, and chronic condition
characteristics (using the F-test). Because the large sample size
of the CCSS and MEPS can influence statistical significance,
we focused on identifying differences in utility scores that
were both statistically significant and clinically meaningful to
patients (13). We considered P values of .05 or less to be statisti-
cally significant and, based on published results among several
patient groups (14,15), defined a minimally important difference
(MID) as a .03-point difference in SF-6D score. Statistical analy-
ses were performed in SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
We restricted the analysis to individuals age 18 to 49 years at
the time of the health status survey. The MEPS sample con-
sisted of 12 803 individuals, and the CCSS included 7105 survi-
vors and 372 siblings (Supplementary Table 1, available online).
SF-6D utilities for survivors were statistically significantly lower
compared with general population estimates (mean ¼ 0.769,
95% confidence interval [CI] ¼ 0.766 to 0.771, vs mean ¼ 0.809,
95% CI ¼ 0.806 to 0.813, respectively, P < .001) and reached MID
overall and in each age group (Table 1). For both women and
men, SF-6D utilities for survivors age 18 to 29 years were similar
to general population estimates for people age 40 to 49 years
(Figure 1). No clinically meaningful differences in SF-6D scores
were detected between siblings of survivors and the general
population (mean ¼ 0.793, 95% CI ¼ 0.782 to 0.805, vs mean ¼
0.809, 95% CI ¼ 0.806 to 0.813, respectively).
Among survivors, differences in SF-6D scores did not reach
MID when comparing across original cancer diagnoses, younger
vs older age at diagnosis, or different treatment exposure
groups (Supplementary Table 2, available online). However, SF-
6D scores did vary by the number and severity of chronic condi-
tions reported (Table 2). Survivors who reported no conditions
had SF-6D scores comparable with general population estimates
(mean ¼ 0.809, 95% CI ¼ 0.804 to 0.815, vs mean ¼ 0.809, 95%
CI ¼ 0.806 to 0.813, respectively, P ¼ .99). In contrast, compared
with those who reported no conditions, SF-6D scores reached
MID and were statistically significantly lower in survivors who
reported two or more conditions (P < .001). Survivors with mul-
tiple severe, disabling or life-threatening conditions (CTCAE
grades 3 or 4) had even greater decrements compared with the
general population (see also Supplementary Figure 1, available
online). Multivariable models found that older attained age, fe-
male sex, and number of chronic conditions were associated
with statistically significant SF-6D score decrements (P < .003)
(Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Figure 2, available
online).
Using the CCSS cohort, the current analysis documents that
chronic conditions substantially and negatively affect the qual-
ity of life of adult survivors of childhood cancer. In particular,
the number and severity of chronic conditions are largely re-
sponsible for poor health-related quality of life as estimated
with utility scores, not original cancer diagnosis or treatment.
Moreover, our analysis shows that younger survivors (age 18-29
years)

 population individuals who are approximately two decades
older, adding to the growing evidence that survivors experience
accelerated aging because of chronic conditions (17). Our find-
ings are encouraging for the 20% of survivors who reported no
chronic conditions, as well as for siblings of childhood cancer
survivors; both groups’ utility scores were similar to those from
the general population.
Limitations to our study include that chronic conditions in
the CCSS were self-reported, although estimated SF-6D scores
reflect quality of life decrements that may be associated with
undiagnosed or unreported conditions. Additionally, the MEPS
comparison group includes participants with and without
chronic conditions prevalent in the general population (hyper-
tension, heart disease, high cholesterol, emphysema, chronic
bronchitis, diabetes, cancer, arthritis, or stroke). However, if we
restrict the comparison to include only MEPS participants and
survivors with any chronic condition, SF-6D scores were similar
(mean ¼ 0.758, 95% CI ¼ 0.752 to 0.765, vs mean ¼ 0.758, 95%
CI ¼ 0.755 to 0.762, respectively, P ¼ .99), providing further
support that cancer survivorship itself is not associated with
quality-of-life decrements. As with all utility measures, the SF-
6D may not fully capture the entirety of well-being (18). We de-
fined the MID based on criteria established by individuals with-
out a cancer history (14,15); survivors may view smaller (or
larger) differences to be clinically meaningful.
Our findings, which represent the first use of utility scores to
illuminate quality-of-life differences among adult survivors
of childhood cancer and nonsurvivors, highlight the importance
of chronic conditions on health-related quality of life for child-
hood cancer survivors and provide encouraging results on the
impact of the cancer experience on long-term sibling well-
being. Use of utility scores may provide a novel framework
for clinicians and researchers engaged in pediatric cancer treat-
ment and trials as they consider therapy choices for childhood
cancer.
