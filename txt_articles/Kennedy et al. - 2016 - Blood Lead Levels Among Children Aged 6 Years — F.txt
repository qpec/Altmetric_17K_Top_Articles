On June 24, 2016, this report was posted as an MMWR Early 
Release on the MMWR website (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr).
During April 25, 2014–October 15, 2015, approximately 
99,000 residents of Flint, Michigan, were affected by changes 
in drinking water quality after their water source was switched 
from the Detroit Water Authority (DWA), sourced from Lake 
Huron, to the Flint Water System (FWS), sourced from the 
Flint River.* Because corrosion control was not used at the 
FWS water treatment plant, the levels of lead in Flint tap water 
increased over time. Adverse health effects are associated with 
lead exposure (1). On January 2, 2015, a water advisory was 
issued because of detection of high levels of trihalomethanes, 
byproducts of disinfectants.†,§ Studies conducted by local and 
national investigators detected an increase in the prevalence 
of blood lead levels (BLLs) ≥5 µg/dL (the CDC reference 
level) among children aged <5 years living in Flint (2) and an 
increase in water lead levels after the water source switch (3). 
On October 16, 2015, the Flint water source was switched 
back to DWA, and residents were instructed to use filtered tap 
water for cooking and drinking. During that time, pregnant 
and breastfeeding women and children aged <6 years were 
advised to consume bottled water.¶ To assess the impact on 
BLLs of consuming contaminated drinking water, CDC exam-
ined the distribution of BLLs ≥5 µg/dL among children aged 
<6 years before, during, and after the switch in water source. 
This analysis enabled determination of whether the odds of 
having BLLs ≥5 µg/dL before the switch differed from the 
odds during the switch to FWS (before and after the January 2, 
2015, water advisory was issued), and after the switch back 
to DWA. Overall, among 9,422 blood lead tests in children 
aged <6 years, 284 (3.0%) BLLs were ≥5 µg/dL during April 
25, 2013–March 16, 2016. The adjusted probability of having 
BLLs ≥5 µg/dL was 46% higher during the period after the 
switch from DWA to FWS (and before the January 2, 2015, 
water advisory) than during the period before the water switch 
to FWS. Although unrelated to lead in the water, the water 
advisory likely reduced tap water consumption and increased 
consumption of bottled water. Characterizing exposure to lead 
contaminated drinking water among children aged <6 years 
living in Flint can help guide appropriate interventions.
Blood lead testing in Michigan is targeted to children living 
at or below the poverty level as well as to children enrolled 
in Medicaid. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 
requires all children on Medicaid to receive blood lead screen-
ing at ages 12 and 24 months, or at ages 36 and 72 months if 
previous screening has not been conducted. Confirmed BLLs 
≥5 µg/dL are defined as having one venous blood lead test 
result ≥5 µg/dL or two capillary blood lead test results ≥5 µg/dL 
drawn within 12 weeks of each other.
Analyses of BLLs obtained during four periods were con-
ducted. These included the period 1) before the switch from 
DWA to FWS (April 25, 2013–April 24, 2014); 2) after the 
switch from DWA to FWS, but before the water advisory was 
issued (April 25, 2014–January 2, 2015); 3) after the switch 
to FWS, and after issuance of the water advisory (January 3, 
2015–October 15, 2015); and 4) after the switch back to DWA 
from FWS (October 16, 2015–March 16, 2016).
Michigan blood lead surveillance data were reviewed, 
cleaned and de-duplicated, and each tested child was assigned 
a unique identifier based on name, sex, date of birth and physi-
cal address. Based on the date of the blood test, results were 
assigned to one of the four periods. If a child had multiple BLL 
tests during a single period, the single highest result was used, 
with venous blood tests preferred over capillary tests. If a BLL 
of ≥5 µg/dL was reported during a given period, no subsequent 
blood lead tests from that child were included in the analysis. 
Analyses were limited to tests on children living in residences 
in the FWS service area; children living in areas serviced by 
an alternative water system were not included. Ninety-six 
percent of all test result addresses were geocoded. To enumer-
ate all children aged <6 years, records of children living in the 
area served by FWS were accessed by reviewing data from the 
Michigan Care Improvement Registry**,†† and the Michigan 
Community Health Automated Medicaid Processing System 
(CHAMPS).§§ Children aged <6 years living in areas serviced

by the FWS were identified in each data set using identifiers 
assigned by the Michigan Data Warehouse.
Age was defined as age at the time of the test. Children were 
excluded once they reached age 6 years. The two race categories 
examined were black or African American and white, the most 
frequently recorded races. If a child’s race was missing in the 
database, race was recorded as other/unknown. To improve 
child race and sex ascertainment, the child blood lead surveil-
lance data were merged with Michigan’s CHAMPS Medicaid 
system, which reports race and sex more comprehensively than 
child blood lead surveillance data.
Prevalences were calculated to examine the proportion of 
BLLs ≥5 µg/dL in children aged <6 years by age group, sex, 
race, and season. To examine whether there was a change in the 
proportion of BLLs ≥5 µg/dL among children aged <6 years 
before, during, and after the switch to FWS, logistic regression 
was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs). The analysis was configured to account for the 
possibility that some children might have had multiple BLL 
tests over the four periods. Multivariable regression analyses 
were conducted for the combined analysis period to adjust 
for possible confounding variables by age group, sex, race, 
and season.
During the assessment period, an estimated 9,622 children 
aged <6 years lived in residences within the area served by 
FWS. Among these children, 7,306 received 9,672 blood lead 
tests before, during, and after the water source switch period. 
Among these tests, 250 (2.6%) were results from a child who 
had a previously detected BLL ≥5 µg/dL at some point during 
the study period; these subsequent tests were excluded from 
the analysis, leaving 9,422 tests for analysis. Among these, 
53% represented the highest venous blood lead test level, 
46% represented the highest capillary blood lead test level in 
the absence of venous blood lead test, and 1% represented the 
highest blood lead test level among tests of unknown type.
During the period before the water source switch, among 
2,408 blood lead tests, 3.1% of BLLs were ≥5 µg/dL; during the 
early switch period, this percentage increased to 5.0% (Table 1). 
The probability of having a BLL ≥5 µg/dL was significantly 
higher during the early switch period than the period before 
the switch (OR = 1.65; CI = 1.20–2.26) (Table 2).
After controlling for covariates, the probability of having BLLs 
≥5 µg/dL remained significantly higher during the early period 
after the water source switch compared with the period before 
the switch (adjusted odds ratio = 1.46; CI = 1.06–2.01) (Table 
3). Additionally, the probability of having BLLs ≥5 µg/dL was 
significantly higher for children aged 1–2 years compared with 
children aged <1 year and significantly higher during summer 
and fall months compared with winter months (Table 3).
Discussion
In the United States, children with elevated BLLs typically 
have been exposed to lead through residential lead paint hazards 
often found in older homes or lead-contaminated house dust 
or soil (1). However, children and adults also can be exposed 
to lead through drinking water (4). Lead most commonly 
enters drinking water as a result of corrosion of leaded plumb-
ing materials and is rarely found at the distribution point or 
wellhead (5). There are three main factors that might influence 
the level of lead leeching into drinking water. These include 
1) whether the plumbing included lead pipes, 2) the pH of 
finished water, and 3) the presence or absence of mineral scale 
in the plumbing (5). Mineral scale on the inner surface of older 
plumbing prevents lead from leaching into drinking water; 
however, when mineral scale is removed or has not developed, 
lead might leach into drinking water from lead solder, even in 
“lead-free” plumbing (5).
Lead in drinking water has been linked to elevated blood 
lead concentrations (6). Among children aged 0–1 year who 
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
In 2014, the city of Flint, Michigan, switched its water source 
from the Detroit Water Authority (DWA) to the Flint Water 
System (FWS). Drinking water can become contaminated with 
lead when there is corrosion in leaded plumbing. Because 
corrosion control was not used at the FWS water treatment 
plant, the levels of lead in Flint tap water increased over time.
What is added by this report?
During April 25, 2013–March 16, 2016, among 9,422 blood lead 
tests received by 7,306 children aged <6 years living in the area 
served by FWS, 3.0% of blood lead level (BLL) test results were 
elevated (≥5 µg/dL). The proportion of elevated BLLs was 
significantly higher (5.0%) during the early period of the switch 
from DWA to FWS compared with the previous period when 
residents consumed water from DWA (3.1%). After the switch 
back to DWA, the percentage of elevated BLLs returned to levels 
comparable to those found before the water source switch.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Flint residents have been recently advised by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency that when using an approved 
and properly installed and maintained water filter, it is safe for 
persons to drink filtered tap water, including pregnant women, 
nursing and bottle-fed children, and children aged <6 years. 
Regular household tap water can be used for bathing and 
showering; however, young children should be prevented from 
drinking bath water. All children aged <6 years living in Flint 
should have their blood tested for lead level, if they have not 
had a blood lead test since October 2015. Case management 
should be provided to all children with elevated BLLs.

consume, on average, 1,200 mL of drinking water per day, 
a lead concentration in water of 20 parts per billion might 
be sufficient to raise the blood lead level of a child from 0 to 
5 µg/dL in the absence of other lead sources (7).
Very young children consume more water per unit of body 
mass than do older children and adults, and they are more likely 
to engage in hand-to-mouth behaviors that put them at higher 
risk for exposure to lead in house dust and soil. Additionally, 
BLLs in children tend to rise in warm weather months, a 
phenomenon that might be related to differential seasonal 
distribution of lead dust in houses as well as higher exposure 
to street dust associated with increased outdoor activity (8). 
However, even after controlling for age and season, the period 
after the water source was switched from DWA to FWS, and 
before the water advisory was issued, remained independently 
associated with an increased probability of BLLs ≥5 µg/dL 
among children aged <6 years living in the area served by FWS.
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita-
tions. First, spurious associations might have resulted from 
failure to control for all confounders because substantial 
information for certain covariates (e.g., race) was either not 
collected or missing. Second, although this analysis demon-
strates increased prevalence of BLLs ≥5 µg/dL coincident with 
the switch to FWS, its observational nature limits attribution 
exclusively to the switch in drinking water source. Third, 
exposure to other known sources of lead that might have 
contributed to a child’s probability of being exposed was not 
ascertained. Fourth, infants who are primarily fed formula 
mixed with tap water are likely to have been more exposed to 
contaminated water; however, few children aged <1 year were 
tested. Thus, the impact of the high water lead levels for this 
age group might have been underestimated. Finally, the decline 
in the proportion of BLLs ≥5 µg/dL after the switch back to 
DWA might have resulted, in part, to increased and continu-
ing bottled water consumption rather than the switch back to 
DWA, reflecting a change in behavior, rather than an effect of 
the change in municipal drinking water source.

¶ Statistically significant OR.
There might be multiple sources of early childhood lead 
exposure (9) in areas with houses built before lead paint use 
in the United States was banned in 1978 (10). However, this 
analysis suggests increased lead exposure related to consuming 
contaminated water in Flint. Flint residents have been recently 
advised by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that 
when using an approved and properly installed and maintained 
water filter, it is safe for persons to drink filtered tap water, 
including pregnant women, nursing and bottle-fed children, 
and children aged <6 years.¶¶ Regular household tap water 
can be used for bathing and showering; however, young chil-
dren should be prevented from drinking bath water. Efforts 
to provide case management to all children residing in Flint 
with BLLs ≥5 µg/dL began in 2016. All children aged <6 years 
living in Flint should have their blood tested for lead, if they 
have not had a blood lead test since October 2015.
