The heterogeneity of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) suggests that successful
treatment might rely on simultaneous targeting of multiple genes, which can be achieved by
RNA interference-based therapeutic strategies. Here we show a potent combination of
microRNA and siRNA delivered by an efficient nanocarrier to PDAC tumors. Using
proteomic-microRNA profiles and survival data of PDAC patients from TCGA, we found a
novel signature for prolonged survival. Accordingly, we used a microRNA-mimic to increase
miR-34a together with siRNA to silence PLK1 oncogene. For in vivo dual-targeting of this
combination, we developed a biodegradable amphiphilic polyglutamate amine polymeric
nanocarrier (APA). APA-miRNA–siRNA polyplexes systemically administered to orthotopi-
cally inoculated PDAC-bearing mice showed no toxicity and accumulated at the tumor,
resulting in an enhanced antitumor effect due to inhibition of MYC oncogene, a common
target of both miR-34a and PLK1. Taken together, our findings warrant this unique combined
polyplex’s potential as a novel nanotherapeutic for PDAC.

espite the better understanding of pancreatic ductal ade-
nocarcinoma (PDAC) molecular biology in the past
decade, almost all targeted therapies have failed to
demonstrate efficacy in late phase clinical trials1. A promising
strategy to treat cancer is knocking-down the expression of spe-
cific cancer-promoting genes by RNA interference (RNAi)-based
therapeutics, such as small interfering RNA (siRNA) and
microRNA (miRNA)2. siRNAs are currently under investigation
in several clinical trials for cancer treatment3. As opposed to
siRNAs, which target a specific gene, miRNAs regulate hundreds
of mRNA targets at once, thus making them an even more
attractive tool to treat cancer4. miRNAs have been shown to be
dysregulated in various human cancers including PDAC5, and to
be involved in cancer pathogenesis and progression6. Reversion of
tumor suppressor miRNAs expression to normal levels can
restore perturbed cellular homeostasis and activate a therapeutic
response7,8. Although miRNAs and siRNAs are usually admi-
nistered separately when tested in cancer animal models and
clinical trials, their combination, aiming at various targets, can
improve therapeutic efficacy9.
One of the miRNAs that was associated with good prognosis in
PDAC patients10,11 and also holds a great therapeutic potential12
is miR-34a. It is a tumor suppressor miRNA downregulated in
PDAC13 which inhibits malignant growth by repressing genes
involved in various cellular signaling pathways, such as pro-
liferation, cell cycle, and senescence14. Although miR-34a pro-
vides prognostic utility, broader molecular signatures that are
altered in this cancer might give a better prognosis prediction. To
identify additional markers to miR-34a predicting long-term
survival with a therapeutic potential, we compared PDAC short-
term survivlors (STS <5 months) with long-term survivors (LTS,
>2 years) using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).
One of the interesting families of cell cycle regulators that
exhibited differential expression in LTS versus STS PDAC
patients was the serine/threonine Polo-like kinases (PLK), in
particular PLK1. The latter, is a mitotic key regulator over-
expressed in PDAC patients15. Interestingly, a recent study
showed that among 38 potential target genes, PLK1 was the only
one that distinguished gemcitabine-sensitive versus-resistant
pancreatic tumors16,17.
Following validation of miR-34a and PLK1 reciprocal levels in
formalin-fixed-paraffin embedded (FFPE) sections obtained from
STS versus LTS PDAC patients, we set to increase miR-34a levels
and decrease the expression of PLK1 in a PDAC animal model.
We hypothesized that dual delivery of potent synthetic miRNA
mimic together with efficacious siRNA might improve ther-
apeutic response. We rationalized to combine miR-34a and
PLK1-siRNA in order to attack distinct molecular defects in this
cancer while inhibiting MYC, a common target of PLK118 and
miR-34a19. We hypothesized that this approach will lead to a
synergistic anticancer effect against PDAC.
Efficient in vivo delivery of miRNA and siRNA for therapeutic
purposes is extremely challenging due to low cellular uptake,
RNase degradation in the bloodstream, rapid renal clearance, and
immunogenicity20,21. In order to overcome these limitations of
RNAi as anticancer treatment, several non-viral delivery systems
have been developed, the majority of them based on a lipidic or
polymeric scaffold21. Potential novel nanocarriers for the delivery
of miRNA/siRNA are poly-(α)glutamic acid (PGA)-based22,23.
PGA is a promising synthetic polymer with attractive properties:
it is water-soluble, non-immunogenic and biodegradable by
cathepsin B24, an enzyme that is highly expressed in most tumor
tissues25. Furthermore, PGA conjugated to the chemotherapeutic
drug paclitaxel (OPAXIO) was shown to be safe at the required
doses in clinical trials for the treatment of several cancer
types26–28. We have recently synthesized a library of aminated
polyglutamates for small oligonucleotides complexation23, out of
which a fully aminated polyglutamate backbone was used in vivo
for the treatment of ovarian cancer showing promising results22.
In this study, we further developed a larger globular supra-
molecular structure based on a PGA backbone for delivering
miRNA and siRNA to tumors in vivo. Via the pendent free γ-
carboxyl group in each repeating unit of L-glutamic acid of the
PGA, we conjugated in parallel ethylenediamine and alkylamine
moieties to form a positively charged amphiphilic nanocarrier.
Utilizing electrostatic-based interactions, this cationic nanocarrier
forms a polyplex with the negatively charged oligonucleotide
cargo. The nanocarrier facilitates oligonucleotides delivery by
improving their stability in the bloodstream and enabling accu-
mulation of the polyplex at the tumor site due to the enhanced
permeability and retention (EPR) effect29. Based on our findings
from TCGA, we used 2 negatively charged small RNAs: miR-34a
for miRNA replacement therapy and PLK1-siRNA for oncogene
silencing in an orthotopic PDAC mouse model. We evaluated the
formation of therapeutically active nano-scaled polyplexes in
pancreatic cancer cells and measured the miRNA mimic-based
activity and siRNA silencing achieved in vitro. We further
examined the tumor accumulation of the nano-polyplexes car-
rying miRNA–siRNA combination, their safety profile ex vivo
and anticancer efficacy in vivo.
Results
High miR-34a/low PLK1 is associated with prolonged survival.
Based on TCGA data obtained from 180 pancreatic cancer
patients, whose survival status was available, we found that
patients with high miR-34a/low PLK1 expression levels had a
significantly longer overall survival (OS) time (longer than
1200 days-LTS) compared to patients with low miR-34a/high
PLK1 (<400 days-STS) (log-rank P < 1.92E-2) (Fig. 1a). This
trend was maintained after controlling for confounders of age,
sex, race, and metastasis to lymph nodes (Cox hazard ratio = 2.56,
P < 1.48E-2). High miR-34a/high PLK1 and low miR-34a/low
PLK1 samples were excluded from our survival analysis. To
validate these findings, we collected PDAC clinical specimens of
STS and LTS (Supplementary Table 1) and evaluated the
expression levels of miR-34a and PLK1. Real-time qRT-PCR
analysis of miR-34a and immunostaining of PLK1 revealed higher
miR-34a levels (Fig. 1b) and lower PLK1 levels (Fig. 1c) in LTS
compared to STS. Quantification of PLK1 expression level based
on histology scores showed significant difference in PLK1 levels
between LTS and STS and also a negative correlation between
PLK1 levels and miR-34a levels (Fig. 1d). Since high miR-34a and
low PLK1 expression levels correlated with favorable outcomes,
we hypothesized that restoration of miR-34a together with
silencing of PLK1 could improve the therapeutic response and
prolong survival. In order to efficiently deliver this combination
of miRNA and siRNA in vivo, we designed and synthesized an
amphiphilic polyglutamate amine (APA) polymeric nanocarrier,
which is composed of repeating units of PGA.

polymer to form an electrostatic-based interaction with miRNAs
and siRNAs, we incubated several Nitrogen/Phosphate (N/P)
ratios of polymer and miRNA–siRNA combination and analyzed
the retardation of the small RNAs mobility on agarose gel using

 electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Positively-charged
APA was able to form a complex with miRNA–siRNA and
neutralize their negative charge with an optimal N/P ratio of 2
(Fig. 2b). The decrease in ethidium bromide fluorescence at high
N/P ratio, 4, might indicate strong affinity between the small
RNAs and the polymer, resulting in reduced ethidium bromide
intercalation.
The
neutralization
of
the
negatively-charged
miRNA–siRNA pair following complexation with the cationic
carrier APA was confirmed by surface charge measurements (zeta
potential) of the polyplex and found to be almost neutral (4.68 ±
3 mV, Fig. 2c). These polyplexes exhibited spherical structures
visible in high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) (Fig. 2d) with an approximate diameter of 150 nm, which
was also confirmed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) measure-
ments (189.79 ± 11 nm, PDI 0.05, Fig. 2c). Following cellular
internalization, the small RNA oligonucleotides are expected to be
released from the polyplex into the cytoplasm. Therefore, we
evaluated the ability of the polyplex to release miR-34a and
PLK1-siRNA in the presence of increasing amounts of the
polyanion
heparin
using
gel
electrophoresis
(Fig.
2e
and
Supplementary Fig. 1). Partial release was obtained at 0.01
heparin Units, while full release was obtained at 1 heparin Unit.
Next, we confirmed that the APA-containing polyplex is capable
of releasing miRNA following incubation with cathepsin B, a
thiol-dependent protease, which degrades PGA and is highly
expressed in most tumor tissues25 including pancreatic can-
cer31,32. Indeed, we observed gradual miRNA release from APA-
miR-34a polyplexes over time following incubation with cathe-
psin B enzyme (Fig. 2f). In order to validate the relevance of
polymer degradation by cathepsin B, we profiled the levels of
active cathepsins (particularly cathepsin B) in PDAC xenograft
tissues. For this purpose, we incubated frozen optimal cutting
temperature (OCT) sections of MiaPaCa2 pancreatic tumor
xenograft and tumor-adjacent normal tissue with Cy5-labeled
activity-based probe (GB123) that covalently targets active
cysteine proteases33. As depicted in the fluorescent microscopy
images, high-expression levels of active cathepsins were found in
MiaPaCa2 pancreatic tumor xenograft tissue, while no con-
siderable expression was observed in the normal adjacent tissue
(Fig. 2g). As a control for specificity of labeling, we also incubated
MiaPaCa2 tissue with a potent active-site cathepsin inhibitor
(GB111)34 prior to incubation with the Cy5-labeled activity-based
probe. No expression of active cathepsins was observed following
treatment with this inhibitor (Fig. 2g). We further evaluated
whether our cathepsin B-degradable system could be relevant for
RNAi delivery in PDAC. Using the Cy5-labeled activity-based
probe, we detected active cathepsin B expression in 4 out of 5
primary PDAC cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 2). These results
were in accordance with previously described data showing high
expression of cathepsins in human PDAC and in human pan-
creatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs) which are preinvasive
precursors of PDAC35.
Polyplex internalization into PDAC cells via endocytosis. We
next evaluated the ability of Cy5-labeled siRNA complexed with
APA to internalize into human MiaPaCa2 PDAC cells. Confocal
images of cellular uptake kinetics of cells incubated with Cy5-
siRNA-APA polyplexes for 4, 24, and 48 h showed that the siRNA
was taken-up within 4 h with a maximum peak of cellular uptake
at 48 h (Fig. 3a, upper panel). Larger magnification of the cells at
48 h following incubation with the polyplexes enabled detection
of the predominant accumulation of Cy5-labeled siRNA in the
cytoplasm (Fig. 3a, lower panel). In order to further evaluate the
cellular localization of the polyplex and to exclude optical arti-
facts, z-scan analysis was performed (Fig. 3a, lower panel, right).

 The siRNA was detected at the same focal plane as the nuclei,
confirming its intracellular localization. Next, cellular inter-
nalization of APA-siRNA polyplex was evaluated in live cells
using imaging flow cytometry which revealed that APA was
capable of delivering Cy5-siRNA into 42.47 ± 1.4% of the cancer
cells (Cy5-positive), as compared to cells treated with Cy5-siRNA
alone with only 0.03% Cy5-positive cells (Fig. 3b). Transfection
using Lipofectamine 2000 served as positive control for siRNA
internalization with 32.65 ± 1.3% Cy5-positive cells. The amount
of cells that internalized the polyplex (shown also by the inter-
nalization histograms, Fig. 3b, lower panel) prompted us to fur-
ther investigate the intracellular uptake, revealing two distinct cell
morphologies of MiaPaCa2 displaying a different pattern of
siRNA uptake. According to the ATCC, MiaPaCa2 cells exhibit
two alternative morphologies: one is adherent epithelial cells and
the second is floating round cells. As shown in Supplementary
Fig. 3, Cy5-labeled siRNA-APA polyplexes were successfully
internalized into the adherent, larger cell population in size (R4),
and not to the round, smaller in size cell populations (R3 and R2).
We observed the same intracellular uptake pattern using Lipo-
fectamine 2000 as transfection reagent. Thus, we concluded that
in live MiaPaCa2 cells siRNA uptake is achieved mostly by the
adherent large cell population. In an attempt to understand
whether this phenomenon is unique to MiaPaCa2 cells, we sought
to evaluate the transfection efficiency in additional pancreatic
cancer cell lines. Flow cytometry analysis showed that Cy5-
labeled APA complexed with siRNA successfully transfected
86.64 ± 4.4% of cells derived from the transgenic KrasG12D;
Trp53R172H; Pdx1-Cre mouse (KPC), 97.43% ± 3.07 of Panc02,
46.76% ± 2.7 of Panc1 and 93.78% ± 4.6 of BxPC3 cells (Sup-
plementary Fig. 4). Next, we aimed to gain insight into the
intracellular
trafficking
of

 microscopy analysis followed by immunostaining with early
endosome antigen 1 (EEA1) and with lysosome-associated
membrane protein 1 (LAMP1), showed that after 48 h incuba-
tion, the majority of the internalized polyplexes were not co-
localize with early endosomes or with late endosomal/lysosomal
compartments (Fig. 3c). Furthermore, the percentage of poly-
plexes that did not co-localized with endosomal/lysosomal com-
partments gradually increased over time (from 47 to 73%,
Fig. 3d). In contrast, the percentage of polyplexes which co-
localized with the early endosome decreased over the same period
of time (from 36 to 17%, Fig. 3d). This might be explained by a
time-dependent release of polyplexes from early endosomes into
the cytoplasm. Co-localization of polyplexes with lysosomes was
relatively low (~10%) and hardly changed during this time course.

 In vitro synergistic antitumor effect of RNAi combination. To
confirm in vitro miRNA and siRNA delivery efficacy, APA
polymer carrying separately, miR-34a or PLK1-siRNA, at the
optimal N/P ratio of 2, was applied to cultured MiaPaCa2 cells
and the levels of miR-34a and its target genes, as well as the levels
of PLK1 mRNA and protein were quantified using real-time qRT-
PCR and western blot analyses. A significant increase in miR-34a
levels following transfection with the APA-miR-34a polyplexes
was observed compared to the untreated cells and NC-miR-
treated cells, with circa 900-fold change increase after 72 h
(Fig. 4a). miR-34a delivered by APA was active and potently
downregulated its target genes Notch1, CDK6, Bcl2, and MET
protein levels (Fig. 4b). Downregulation of these target proteins
ranged between 44% and 84%. Transfection with a non-targeted
negative control (NC)-miR had no effect on the expression levels
of the evaluated target genes. Transfection of cells with APA-
PLK1-siRNA polyplexes was also efficient and decreased PLK1
expression by 50 and 80% at the mRNA and protein levels,
respectively (Fig. 4c, d).
miR-34a was identified as having a tumor suppressive function
in pancreatic cancer, in which it is commonly deleted36. siRNA
targeting PLK1 was found to inhibit the proliferation of
pancreatic cancer cells37. Therefore, we determined the ability
of those two anticancer candidates, miR-34a and PLK1-siRNA
complexed with our APA nanocarrier, to inhibit the tumorigeni-
city of pancreatic cancer cells. To that end, we measured cell
viability (Fig. 4e–g), cell migration (Fig. 4h), and cell growth and
survival using a clonogenicity assay (Fig. 4j) following treatment
with APA-miRNA–siRNA polyplexes. First, cells were transfected
with serial concentrations of APA-polyplexes containing miR-34a
or PLK1-siRNA alone and viable cells were counted by Coulter
Counter. Both miR-34a alone (Fig. 4e) and PLK1-siRNA alone
(Fig. 4f) significantly reduced the viability of MiaPaCa2 cells in a
dose-dependent
manner
(up
to
49%
at
250 nM
miRNA
concentration and up to 58% at 100 nM siRNA concentration)
compared with the NC-miR/NC-siRNA treatment and with the
untreated cells. Moreover, the combination treatment of miR-34a
and PLK1-siRNA further reduced cell viability compared to each
RNAi alone (Fig. 4g). To evaluate the nature of this reduction in
cell viability, we used the additive model38. Using this method, we
determined a synergistic reduction in the combined treatment
(observed/expected ratio = 0.52, Supplementary Table 2).
Cell migration was evaluated in a wound healing assay using
the IncuCyte Live Cell Analysis System. Cells treated with NC-
miR-NC-siRNA and cells that were left untreated closed the
wound almost completely (~80%) within 48 h (Fig. 4h, Supple-
mentary Fig. 5). Cells treated with miR-34a or PLK1-siRNA
partially closed the wound over this time frame, whereas cells
treated with the RNAi combination closed only 50% of the wound
(a reduction of 30% compared to the untreated cells and to the
NC-miR-NC-siRNA treated cells) (Fig. 4h, i, Supplementary
Fig. 5 and Supplementary Movie 2). The effect on growth and
survival of pancreatic cancer cells was assessed also using
clonogenic assay. MiaPaCa2 cells that were treated with the
combination of miR-34a and PLK1-siRNA using APA had low
number and small size of surviving colonies (by 64%) compared
to the untreated cells (Fig. 4j, k).
In order to validate that our therapy is applicable not only for
MiaPaCa2 cells, we set to evaluate its ability to inhibit cell
proliferation and colony formation on two additional human
PDAC cell lines, BxPC3 and Panc1 and on the murine cell line,
KPC. The latter is derived from the genetically engineered mouse
model (GEMM) KPC, which was shown to be of relevance to the
human
clinical
set-up39.
KPC
mice
conditionally
express
endogenous mutant Kras and p53 alleles in pancreatic cells40,41,
which develop pancreatic tumors whose pathophysiological and
molecular features resemble those of human PDAC. The
combination treatment showed synergistic reduction in cell
viability (of 72% in KPC, 70% in Panc1 and 65% in BxPC3) as
analyzed using the additive model (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b,
Supplementary Fig. 7a–d). In addition, KPC cells treated with the
combination closed only 33% of the wound compared to the
untreated cells and to the NC-miR/NC-siRNA treated cells that
closed the wound almost completely (Supplementary Fig. 6c). The
combination significantly reduced the number and size of
surviving colonies of PDAC cells (by 72% in KPC, 75% in Panc1,
and 55% in BxPC3) compared to the untreated cells (Supple-
mentary Figs. 6d, 7e, f). These results indicate that APA carrying
miR-34a/PLK1-siRNA combination could inhibit pancreatic
cancer cells growth, migration, and survival effectively in a
synergistic manner.
APA-siRNA polyplexes demonstrate a biocompatible profile.
In order to evaluate the safety profile of APA as a nanocarrier, an
ex vivo cytokine-induction assay was performed using human
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which determined
the secretion level of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and
TNF-α representing the innate immune response. Neither APA
alone nor APA-siRNA polyplex promoted the secretion of the
evaluated cytokines (Fig. 5a) compared to the Toll-like receptor 4
natural ligand, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), that induced the
secretion of high levels of both cytokines. Next, in order to
determine the ability of the polyplex to be administered sys-
temically, stability of the polyplex was evaluated in vitro in 100%
fetal bovine serum (FBS). There was no release of miRNA from
the polyplexes prepared at N/P ratio of 2 up to 12 h of incubation,
while polyplexes of APA and siRNA prepared at 1.5 N/P ratio
demonstrated much lower stability30. Moreover, APA polymer
stabilized miR-34a and prevented its degradation for a longer
time (12 h) compared to naked miR-34a (Fig. 5b). Biocompat-
ibility was also assessed by measuring red blood cell (RBC) lysis.
Serial dilution of APA (1–10,000 μg ml−1) were used at the rele-
vant in vivo concentrations and were adjusted to their dilution in

 the mouse blood volume (2 ml). The results clearly showed that at
these concentrations our polyplexes did not cause hemolysis
ex vivo and are, therefore, suitable for intravenous (i.v.) admin-
istration (Fig. 5c). To determine the maximum tolerated dose
(MTD) of APA-miRNA–siRNA polyplexes, we evaluated the
viability of Balb/c mice and monitored them for a period of
5 weeks, following a single i.v. injection of the polyplex at various
small RNA oligonucleotide doses of miRNA–siRNA (1, 2, 4, and
6 mg kg−1, at 1:1 ratio). The mice were viable following all
miRNA–siRNA doses (Table 1). We further assessed the poly-
plexes effect on mouse normal pancreas and on glucose levels in
mouse blood. Following 3 sequential i.v. injections of APA-miR-

 34a-PLK1-siRNA polyplexes or PBS, blood glucose levels were
measured from the tail vein and pancreas was resected, embedded
in paraffin and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E). No
differences in normal pancreas morphology as well as in blood
glucose levels were observed between PBS-treated and polyplex
treated mice (Fig. 5d, e). Taken all together, we demonstrated the
safety profile of our nanocarrier.
Polyplexes selectively accumulate in orthotopic PDAC tumors.
To assess whether APA nanocarrier accumulates preferably at the
tumor site once injected systemically, we developed an orthotopic
pancreatic cancer mouse model by injecting mCherry-labeled
MiaPaCa2 cells into the pancreas of SCID mice. Two-weeks post
injection, tumor growth was monitored by the increase in
mCherry fluorescent signal (Supplementary Fig. 8a, b) which was
found only in the pancreas (Supplementary Fig. 8c). In addition,
we characterized the pancreatic tumor vasculature functionality
and morphology of our orthotopic xenograft mouse model, which
showed enlarged unorganized leaky blood vessels as compared to
normal pancreas (Supplementary Fig. 10a–d). To determine
whether our orthotopic PDAC mouse model mimics properly the
clinical setting of dense stroma, FFPE sections were stained for α-
Smooth Muscle Actin (α-SMA) for activated fibroblasts. Indeed,
cancer-associated activated fibroblasts were highly visible in
PDAC compared to healthy pancreas (Supplementary Fig. 10e).
To study the pharmacokinetics profile of polyplexes, mice bearing
orthotopic mCherry-labeled tumors were administered via the tail
vein with APA: Cy5-labeled siRNA polyplexes (0.5 mg kg−1
siRNA, 100 µl) or with Cy5-labeled siRNA alone at the same dose
and imaged at different time points. The polyplex demonstrated
preferable accumulation in the tumor site over time up to 24 h as
shown by the Cy5 fluorescent signal in the mice treated with
APA:Cy5-siRNA (Fig. 6a). When Cy5-siRNA was injected with-
out APA, no accumulation was observed in the intact mice
(Fig. 6a). In order to determine the biodistribution profile of the
polyplex, we resected the tumors and healthy organs (heart, lungs,
liver, kidneys, and spleen) from mice, 24 h following i.v. admin-
istration of Cy5-labeled siRNA alone or complexed with APA and
measured the fluorescent intensity of Cy5. When Cy5-labeled
siRNA was injected while complexed with APA nanocarrier, there
was accumulation of the fluorescent signal in the tumor and
relatively low accumulation in the kidneys, spleen, heart, lungs,
and liver (Fig. 6b, Supplementary Fig. 9). In contrast, when Cy5-
labeled siRNA was injected alone, we detected accumulation
mainly in the kidneys and relatively small amounts in the tumor
(Fig. 6b). Quantification of Cy5 component revealed a significant
fivefold increase in total signal (scaled counts s−1 g−1 tissue) of the
siRNA complexed with APA compared to siRNA alone at the
tumor site (Fig. 6c). There was no significant difference in the
heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys localization between treatments
with free or complexed RNAi. Further confocal analysis of frozen
samples prepared from the resected tumors confirmed that the
polyplex accumulated in the PDAC tumor (Fig. 6d). We further
assessed the accumulation of miR-34a in the orthotopic PDAC
tumors following 3 sequential i.v. injections of PBS or polyplex
formulated with miR-34a or NC-miR (n = 4 mice per group,
2 mg kg−1 miR dose). miR-34a levels were fivefold higher in
tumors isolated from mice treated with APA-miR-34a polyplex,
compared to mice treated with either PBS or APA-NC-miR
(Fig. 6e). We also quantified miR-34a target genes levels by real-
time qRT-PCR. Tumors from APA-miR-34a-treated mice had
reduced levels of Bcl2, CDK6, MET and Notch1 by 45, 25, 20, and
11%, respectively, relative to APA-NC-miR treated mice (Fig. 6f).
These data suggest that APA nanocarrier successfully delivered
functionally therapeutic small RNA oligonucleotides into PDAC
tumors.
In vivo antitumor effect of miRNA–siRNA combination. To
determine the therapeutic effects of our combined miR-34a and
PLK1-siRNA treatment in vivo, tumor-bearing mice were ran-
domized into four nanoparticle treatment groups: (i) miR-34a/
PLK1-siRNA, (ii) miR-34a/NC-siRNA, (iii) PLK1-siRNA/NC-
miR, and (iv) NC-miR/NC-siRNA, and a group treated with PBS
(n = 6/7 mice per group). Mice were i.v. injected as depicted in
Fig. 7a. Tumor growth monitoring using intravital fluorescence
imaging revealed that miR-34a/PLK1-siRNA combination ther-
apy induced pancreatic tumor regression, inhibiting tumor
growth to an average of 3.85% (111.3 ± 39 scaled counts per s)
compared to tumors treated with PBS or NC-miR/NC-si (P <
0.05 for both) at day 45 (Fig. 7b). Each monotherapy of miR-34a/
NC-siRNA or PLK1-siRNA/NC-miR inhibited tumor growth to
an average of 31% (896.6 ± 91 scaled counts per second) and
44.25% (1278.0 ± 459 scaled counts per second), respectively
(Fig. 7b). All animals tolerated small RNA therapy well, with no
significant weight loss (Fig. 7c). A representative image of treated
mice at day 33 showed differences in fluorescence signal (Fig. 7d).
This suggests that targeted combination RNAi therapy using
miR-34a and PLK1-siRNA elicit a potent antitumor response.
Survival of mice treated with the combination was significantly
prolonged (P < 0.05) compared to all other treatment groups
(Fig. 7e). We then evaluated the effect of our combination therapy
on proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis on FFPE sections of
tumors resected from treated mice on day 45. For that, we
immunostained the resected tumors with ki67, cleaved caspase 3
and CD31 antibodies. We observed that the combination treat-
ment inhibited proliferation and angiogenesis and increased
apoptosis to a larger extent compared to the monotherapies
(Fig. 7f, g). The effects of the treatments on blood counts and
chemistry were also studied. For that, blood was withdrawn from
mice treated with either PBS or APA-small RNA oligonucleotides

affected blood counts (Supplementary Fig. 11) nor blood chem-
istry parameters (Supplementary Table 3).
Antitumor effect is due to a decrease in the shared target MYC.
We hypothesized that the superior antitumor response following
combination treatment might be explained by targeting impor-
tant oncogenes downstream to miR-34a and PLK1. To identify
these shared targets, we looked for transcripts that are predicted
as targets of both of them. Using miRNA target prediction and
molecular pathways analyses, we identified V-Myc Avian Mye-
locytomatosis Viral Oncogene Homolog (MYC) as a miR-34a
target (miRanda; mirSVR score: –0.163) (Fig. 8a), as well as a
downstream protein to PLK1. Previous work has already con-
firmed using a reporter assay that miR-34a directly targets MYC
through a conserved seed region in its 3′-UTR at positions
123–14419. Consistent with this, following ectopic expression of
miR-34a alone or combined with PLK1 using our polymeric
nanocarrier, the expression of MYC was reduced in MiaPaCa2
cells (Fig. 8b). Furthermore, immunohistochemistry staining of
tumor tissues from the in vivo efficacy study showed that the

 combination therapy significantly reduced MYC levels (Fig. 8c).
To understand the clinical relevance of the observed down-
regulation of MYC, we evaluated the levels of MYC in the same
FFPE specimens of short-term and long-term PDAC patients
presented in Fig. 1. MYC immunostaining of these samples
revealed low levels of MYC in LTS compared to STS (Fig. 8d, e).
We also evaluated the levels of other target genes of miR-34a,
MET and Bcl2, in these patient samples. We found no significant
difference in MET and Bcl2 expression levels between the STS
and the LTS (Supplementary Fig. 12). To further verify our
hypothesis that MYC is the mediator of the antitumor properties
of our therapy, we evaluated whether overexpression of MYC
could rescue the tumorigenic phenotype of PDAC cells. Mia-

 that lacks the 3′-UTR and thus miR-34a binding site. Following
MYC overexpression which was confirmed by immunoblotting
(Fig. 8f), cells were treated with miR-34a-PLK1-siRNA combi-
nation or left untreated. Cell viability of naive (wild type) Mia-
PaCa2 PDAC cells was decreased when treated with the
combination. However, MYC-overexpressed cells treated with the
combination showed no significant difference in cell viability
compared to MYC-overexpressed-cells that were not treated (Fig.
8f). These results suggest that the effect of the combination of
miR-34a and PLK1-siRNA is dependent on MYC down-
regulation. According to these results, we suggested a model for
the mechanism showing how our dual miRNA–siRNA combi-
nation treatment contributes to the synergistic anticancer effects
in PDAC via MYC (Fig. 8g).
Discussion
In this study, we initially identified a combination of prognostic
markers, miR-34a and PLK1, that showed better OS in pancreatic
cancer patients. We hypothesized that by using this specific
combination, we could attack distinct and central molecular
pathways in pancreatic cancer, which in turn will lead to
improved therapeutic response and prolonged survival. We show
here the rational synthesis and characterization of a novel bio-
degradable PGA-based polymeric nanocarrier for the combined
delivery of siRNA and miRNA to PDAC tumors. Systemic in vivo
delivery of miR-34a and PLK1-siRNA by our APA nanocarrier,
which facilitated accumulation preferably at the tumor site and
internalization into the tumor cells, efficiently inhibited tumor
growth in an orthotopic mouse model, with no systemic side
effects nor immunotoxicity. This delivery of the combined ther-
apy synergistically improved preclinical outcomes, leading to
significant reduction in primary tumor growth and hence might
be considered in the future as a possible addition to conventional
chemotherapeutic drugs given in the clinic. One major advantage
of our delivery system is its ability to carry any combination
composed of RNA or DNA oligonucleotides needed for the same
cell for optimal synergistic efficacy. This type of nanocarrier-
cargo system should enable loading of specific therapeutic agents
for tailor-made treatments.
Since small RNAs can stimulate innate cytokine responses,
which may be amplified by efficient delivery into the cell by
carriers42, it is crucial to assess the carrier’s immunogenic
potential. Whereas our APA nanocarrier did not induce IL-6 and
TNF-α cytokine secretion, complement activation of the immune
response will require further evaluation. Another important pre-
requisite for successful delivery of oligonucleotides in vivo is the
stability of the polyplex under the biological milieu. We showed
that our polyplex was stable in serum following 12 h of incubation
and improved the stability profile of miRNA compared to its
naked form. This could be attributed to steric hindrance created
by the polymer and to the stable complex formed between the
RNA and the polymer, thereby decreasing its interaction with
exogenous RNases present in the serum. Future studies will need
to explore the use of a further stabilized polyplex to increase the
circulation time in the bloodstream beyond 12 h in order to
extend the long-term effect of the treatment.
Polymer-RNAi polyplexes accumulate selectively at tumor
tissues by the EPR effect. The impaired hyperpermeable tumor
vessels, as was demonstrated in our orthotopic mouse model
(Supplementary Fig. 10), allow preferential extravasation of cir-
culating macromolecules that are subsequently retained there due
to poor lymphatic drainage43. Use of nano-sized polymeric car-
riers enables passive targeting of miRNAs and siRNAs to tumors,
minimizing non-specific targeting to healthy organs and lowering
the amount of small RNAs that needs to be administered to reach
the desired therapeutic effect. We showed that APA-siRNA
polyplexes accumulated selectively at the tumor site, following
systemic administration. However, a small amount of polyplexes
accumulated also in the spleen. This could be explained by the
fact that upon systemic administration, nano-sized carriers are
rapidly distributed to organs in the reticuloendothelial system
(RES) and phagocytosed by the mononuclear phagocyte system
(e.g., macrophages and liver Kupffer cells). These clearance pro-
cesses, mediated by the interaction of particles with blood com-
ponents (e.g., immunoglobulins of the complement system),
result in higher particle accumulations in RES organs, such as
liver and spleen44. Both polyplex and siRNA alone were accu-
mulated, to the same extent, in the kidneys. This is in accordance
with previously shown accumulation of radiolabeled siRNA in the
kidneys of rats which was excreted via the urine, post i.v.
injection45.
Although each of the monotherapies, miR-34a and PLK1-
siRNA, was tested alone in the clinic, their combination has not
been evaluated yet. Indeed, human PLK1 was found to be
involved in the formation and progression of many tumor
types46. To date, PLK1-siRNA is one out of four RNAi-based
drugs that have been evaluated in early clinical trials for cancer
therapy through systemic administration47. miR-34a has also
entered clinical trial lately in order to test its safety in primary
liver cancer and other selected solid tumors or hematologic
malignancies (ClinicalTrials. gov identifier: NCT01829971). Here,
we evaluated, for the first time, the ability of the combination of
these two anticancer RNAi candidates complexed with our APA
nanocarrier to inhibit pancreatic cancer progression. We found
significant reduction in cell viability, migration and survival fol-
lowing treatment with APA-miRNA–siRNA combined poly-
plexes. Although we showed in vivo efficacy only in the human
MiaPaCa2 model, we found convincing evidence from the lit-
erature showing both overexpression of PLK1 oncogene and
downregulation of miR-34a in PDAC patients. Pancreatic ade-
nocarcinomas were PLK1 positive in 47.7% of cases (out of 86
patient samples) in one study15 and in 80% of cases (out of 140
patient samples) in another48. Also, the expression of miR-34a
was shown to be frequently lost in 15 pancreatic cancer cell lines
compared to normal pancreatic cell lines (HPNE and HPDE)14.
Taken together, we presented the potential of our combination
therapy as clinically relevant for PDAC patients.
Based on TCGA data and our results from several human and
murine cell lines, we can determine that our miR-34a-PLK1-

 siRNA APA treatment is clearly relevant to patients with inverse
correlation expression of low miR-34a and high PLK1. However,
as high and low levels are relative to an unknown control in the
clinic, it seems to us that in the case of PDAC, upregulating miR-
34a and downregulating PLK1 will probably be beneficial even if
both markers are low or both are high. As noted in the beginning,
we compared survival between high miR-34a/low PLK1 and low
miR-34a/high PLK1 in order to identify the feasibility of our
intervention to affect patient survival. In fact, we observe that
miR-34a and PLK1 expression is marginally positively correlated

 (Spearman R = 0.19, P < 0.01), thus our intervention is likely to
revert this correlation, lower the tumor's fitness, and lead to
improved patient survival. To prove this, we will need to evaluate
our system on an array of PDAC models with different expression
patterns of miR-34a and PLK1 (both high, both low and inter-
mediate levels) which although interesting and important, it is out
of the scope of this manuscript.
The concept of RNAi therapy by combining a set of miRNA
(520d-3p) and siRNA (EphA2) was also shown to be effective in a
recent work in which liposomal nanoparticles were utilized to
target oncogenic pathways altered in a different cancer model of
ovarian carcinoma49. In another study, concurrent delivery of
miR-34a and KRAS-siRNA using a lipid/polymer nanoparticle
led to antitumor effects in a lung cancer mouse model50. The
combination treatment of two microRNAs, miR-34a and miR-
143/145, entrapped in a lipid-based nanoparticle, has also shown
significant therapeutic efficacy in an orthotopic xenograft model
of pancreatic cancer51. However, combining microRNA mimic
with siRNA for pancreatic cancer therapy has not been reported
to date.
We showed that these antitumor effects are, at least partially,
due to a decrease in MYC, a shared downstream target of both
miR-34a and PLK1. Recently, PLK1 was identified as one of
MYC-associated proteins using a proteomic approach52. PLK1
was also shown to directly interact with MYC and induce MYC
phosphorylation18. MYC is a central oncogene in PDAC and
genetic alterations of MYC were observed in 70% of PDAC
patients53. MYC, a major regulator of transcription, induces
tumor growth, cellular proliferation, protein synthesis, and
increased cell metabolism54. Because most genetic or epigenetic
events in PDAC initiation and progression contribute to MYC
activation, its targeting in PDAC is a highly promising ther-
apeutic option. However, development of potent small molecules
for MYC inhibition is extremely challenging due to lack of
enzymatic
activity
of
MYC
and
its
function
through
protein–protein and protein–DNA interactions55. Therefore,
small RNA-based technologies, might serve as a more selective
approach to target MYC. As we show here, the combination of
miR-34a and PLK1-siRNA downregulated MYC in PDAC cells
in vitro and decreased significantly MYC levels in MiaPaCa2
orthotopic tumors in vivo. Moreover, the observation that MYC
expression levels in PDAC patients with long-term survival were
lower compared to short-term ones strengthens the clinical
potential of our combined miRNA–siRNA treatment. Also, the
observation that the two patient populations did not differ from
each other in the levels of MET and Bcl2 (other targets of miR-
34a)
emphasizes
the
specific
effect
on
MYC
by
our
miRNA–siRNA combination treatment. The results showing that
the tumorigenic phenotype of MYC-overexpressed-cells could not
be rescued by our therapy suggest that the effect of miR-34a and
PLK1-siRNA is dependent on MYC; however, we do not rule out
the effect of miR-34a in other cancer-associated pathways by
targeting additional genes, which might assist in its antitumor
phenotype.
Our results demonstrate that small RNA oligonucleotides
therapy can synergistically inhibit solid pancreatic tumor growth,
and that rationally designed targeted RNA combination nano-
therapies carried by our APA nanocarrier may be used to
improve therapeutic response in patients who desperately need it.
Methods
Survival analysis based on TCGA data. We downloaded pancreatic cancer
patient data from TCGA, which covers 180 patient samples that have available
information of gene expression, miRNA expression and clinical data. The samples
were divided into 4 groups based on the median expression values of miR-34a and
PLK1. We compared the patient survival between high miR-34a/low PLK1 and low
miR-34a/high PLK1 (high miR-34a/high PLK1 and low miR-34a/low
PLK1 samples were excluded from our survival analysis). We performed
Kaplan–Meier analysis to compare patient survival between these two groups using
log-rank test. We further controlled for potential confounding factors such as age,
sex, race, and metastasis to lymph nodes using a Cox proportional hazard model:
hs t; patient
ð
Þ � h0s t
ð Þexp βII þ βageage þ βlymphlymph
�
�
;
where s is an indicator variable overall possible combinations of patients’ stratifi-
cations based on race and sex. hs is the hazard function (defined as the risk of death
of patients per time unit), and h0s(t) is the baseline-hazard function at time t of the
sth stratification. The model contains three covariates: (i) I: indicator variable
whether the samples belong to high miR-34a/low PLK1 group or low miR-34a/high
PLK1 group, (ii) age: age of the patient, and (iii) lymph: metastasis to lymph nodes.
The βs are the regression coefficients of the covariates, which quantify the effect of
covariates on the survival, which were determined by standard likelihood max-
imization of the model56.
FFPE human PDAC specimens. FFPE specimens were obtained with the approval
of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and in compliance with all legal and ethical
considerations for human subject research. A total of 10 FFPE samples were col-
lected from Sheba Medical Center tissue archive: 7 samples of LTS and 3 samples of
STS. FFPE samples were analyzed for miRNA levels by real-time qRT-PCR and for
PLK1, MYC, Bcl2 and MET levels by immunstaining. Immunostained slides were
blindly evaluated by the study pathologist and scored as follows: 0–3: 0- none, 1-
weak, 2- moderate, 3- high.
APA synthesis. To a solution of PGA (56 mg, 0.43 mmol per monomer) in dry N,
N-Dimethylformamide (DMF, 2.5 ml) a solution of Carbonyldiimidazole (86 mg,
0.53 mmol) in dry DMF (1.5 ml) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred for
1.5 h at 25 °C under Argon atmosphere. Tributylamine (0.1 ml, 0.43 mmol) was
added and the reaction was left to stir for 5 min. A solution of Hexylamine (19 mg,
0.19 mmol) and Boc-ethylenediamine (42 mg, 0.26 mmol) in dry DMF (2 ml) was
added and the reaction mixture was stirred for additional 12 h at the starting
conditions. A solution of carbonyldiimidazole (146 mg, 0.9 mmol) in dry DMF
(1 ml) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred for additional 12 h at the
starting conditions. DMF was removed under reduced pressure. Double distilled
water (DDW, 40 ml) was added and the reaction mixture was freeze dried. The
resulting solid was dissolved in dichloromethane (DCM, 5 ml) and trifluoroacetic
acid (5 ml) was added at 0 °C. The mixture was stirred at 25 °C for 10 min and then
evaporated under reduced pressure. The oily residue was dissolved in DDW
(40 ml) and the aqueous phase was extracted with DCM (2 × 50 ml) and Diethyl
ether (50 ml). The aqueous phase was collected, treated with a 10% NaOH solution
to reach pH 5 and freeze dried. The obtained solid was dissolved in DDW (20 ml)
and dialyzed for 48 h at 4 °C. The aqueous phase was collected and freeze dried to
receive a white powder of trifuoroactice salt, with a 53% yield. For Cy5-labeling of
APA, Cyanine dye Cy5-COOH was conjugated directly to the APA backbone. The
final Cy5-APA conjugate was purified by dialysis in DDW using a 3.5 kDa a
dialysis membrane (GeBaFlex, Gene Bio-Application). Chemical analysis and
characterization was published elsewhere30.

 Electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The optimal N/P ratio for polyplex for-
mation was studied using EMSA. miRNA and siRNA (50 pmol total) and
increasing amounts of APA were mixed together in RNase-free ultra-pure water
(UPW, Biological Industries), incubated at room temperature for 20–30 min and
analyzed by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel for 30 min at 100 V.
DLS, zeta potential, and TEM. Analysis of the mean hydrodynamic diameter of
APA-miRNA-siRNA polyplex (0.1 mg APA polymer, N/P 2, in UPW) was per-
formed using VASCO particle size analyzer (Cordouan Technology). Zeta potential
of the polyplex (15.5 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) was measured using a Zeta-
Sizer Nano ZS instrument with an integrated 4 mW He-Ne laser (λ = 633 nm;
Malvern). All measurements were performed at 25 °C. For TEM: samples were
adsorbed on formvar/carbon coated grids and stained with 2% aqueous uranyl
acetate. Samples were examined using Jeol 1200EX transmission electron micro-
scope (Jeol).
Heparin-induced release of miRNA and siRNA. The relative stability of APA
polyplexes was tested by measuring miRNA release from the polyplexes in the
presence of a competing polyanion, heparin (Sigma-Aldrich). Polyplex solutions
(N/P 2) were incubated in the presence of 0.01–0.1 international units (IU) of
heparin 50 pmol−1 miRNA/siRNA for 15 min. Samples were analyzed by
electrophoresis and run on a 2% agarose gel for 30 min at 100 V.
Cathepsin B labeling with Cy5-labeled activity-based probe. PDAC cell lines
(300,000 cells per well, 6-well plate) and frozen tissue sections of orthotopic tumor
xenografts and normal adjacent tissue were pretreated with either 5 µM cathepsin
inhibitor (GB11134, not fluorescently labeled) or DMSO (0.1%). Then, all samples
were incubated for 4 h with Cy5-labeled activity-based probe GB12333 (0.25 µM for
tissues or 2 µM for cells, 0.1% DMSO final concentration). To visualize active
cathepsin labeling, tissue sections were stained with DAPI and imaged with a
fluorescent microscope equipped with a 630 nm laser. Treated PDAC cells were
lysed, separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE and scanned by Typhoon scanner (GE
Healthcare) using an excitation/emission filter set of 635/670 nm. Following
scanning, SDS–PAGE was immunoblotted on a PVDF membrane and incubated
with beta-Actin antibody (Abcam, 1:1000). Chemiluminescence was measured with
a ChemiDocXRS imaging system.
Cell culture. Human pancreatic cancer cell lines MiaPaCa2, Panc1, BxPC3 and the
murine pancreatic cancer cell line Panc02, were purchased from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC). KPC cells were established in the laboratory of
Surinder K. Batra and derived from pancreatic adenocarcinoma tumors of
KrasG12D; Trp53R172H; Pdx1-Cre (KPC) transgenic mice57. KPC cells were pro-
vided by Surinder Batra under a signed MTA with The University of Nebraska
Medical Center. All cell lines used in this paper are not listed in the database of
commonly misidentified cell lines maintained by ICLAC. The cell lines have not
been authenticated. All cells were mycoplasma free. Cells were cultured in Dul-
becco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS), 100 U ml−1 penicillin, 100 µg ml−1 streptomycin and 2 mM L-gluta-
mine (Biological Industries) and grown at 37 °C; 5% CO2.
Confocal microscopy. MiaPaCa2 cells (2 × 105 per well) were seeded in 24-well
plate on cover slips for 24 h. Polyplexes containing APA (3.5 μg ml−1) and Cy5-
labeled siRNA (100 nM, Syntezza Bioscience) were added to cells and incubated for
4, 24, and 48 h. Slides were washed twice with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA, Electron Microscopy Sciences) at room temperature for 20 min and washed
again with PBS. Next, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS was added for 2 min and slides
were washed twice with PBS. Actin filaments were stained with fluorescein iso-
thiocyanate (FITC)-labeled phalloidin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 40 min and slides were
washed and mounted with Prolong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen).
For immunofluorescence staining, fixed permeabilized cells were blocked with
normal mouse/rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) in blocking solution
(PBS, 2% BSA) for 30 min. Cells were then incubated with mouse anti-EEA1 (BD
Biosciences) and rabbit anti-LAMP1 (Cell Signaling) primary antibodies for 1 h
and washed three times. Finally, anti-mouse FITC and anti-rabbit Rhodamine (BD
Biosciences) secondary antibodies were applied for 30 min at room temperature
and slides were washed and mounted as described above. Cellular internalization
and trafficking were monitored using Leica SP5 Confocal Imaging system (Leica
Microsystems).
Transfection of APA-miRNA–siRNA polyplex. PDAC cells were seeded in 6-well
plates and 24 h later transfected with polyplexes containing APA and miRNA/
siRNA at the indicated concentrations in antibiotic-free medium. Twenty-four or
48 h later, cells were collected, and total RNA or proteins were extracted.
miRNA/mRNA expression levels determination. Total RNA from cultured cells
was isolated using EZ-RNA II total RNA isolation kit (Biological Industries)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA from FFPE tissues was
isolated using miRNeasy FFPE kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. RNA quality was measured using NanoDrop (Thermo Scientific).
Reverse transcription reaction for miRNA and mRNA was performed using miS-
cript II Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen) with Hiflex buffer supplemented in the
kit. miRNA expression levels were quantified by real-time qRT-PCR using miScript
Primer assay (Qiagen) and normalized to RNU6. mRNA levels were quantified
using custom qRT-PCR primers (Syntezza Bioscience) and normalized to Actin.
qRT-PCR for miRNA and mRNAs was performed using miScript SYBR Green
PCR kit (Qiagen) or SensiFAST SYBR HiROX kit (Bioline), respectively, according
to manufacturer’s instructions using StepOnePlus real-time PCR system (Applied
Biosystems). Primers were designed as: CDK6 FWD: 5′-TCACGAACAGACA-

Western blot analysis. Cells were homogenized with lysis buffer and debris was
removed by centrifugation. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA
protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific). Lysates were loaded on 10% SDS–PAGE gel
and transferred by electroporation to nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were
blocked for 1 h in TBST buffer containing 5% milk and incubated with mouse anti-

rabbit anti-MYC (cat# 10828-1-AP, 1:1000, Proteintech). Mouse anti-HSC70 (cat#
SC-7298, 1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or goat anti-actin (cat# SC-1616,
1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were used for loading control. Analysis was
performed using HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies: rabbit anti-goat (cat#
AP106P, 1:1000, Chemicon International), goat anti-mouse (cat# ab7068, 1:10,000,
Abcam) and goat anti-rabbit (cat# SC-2004, 1:10,000, Santa Cruz) followed by
ECL-PLUS Detection Kit (Pierce). Band quantification was performed using
ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) and protein levels were normalized
to Actin or HSC70 levels. For uncropped scans of blots see Supplementary Fig. 13.
Cell viability assay. MiaPaCa2, BxPC3 (2 × 104 cells per well), KPC and Panc1
(1 × 104 cells per well−1) were plated onto 24-well plates. Twenty-four hours later,
cells were transfected with APA-miRNA–siRNA polyplexes. Following 72 h incu-
bation, cells were washed, detached by trypsin and viable cells were counted by Z1
Coulter Counter (Beckman Coulter).
Live cell uptake of APA-siRNA polyplexes. Internalization of Cy5-labeled siRNA
into live PDAC cells was followed using ImageStream 100 Imaging Flow Cytometer
(Amnis). Live cells (2 × 106 50 μl−1 PBS supplemented with 0.5% BSA) were
monitored 24 h following transfection with Cy5-labeled siRNA (100 nM) alone or
complexed with APA. Lipofectamine 2000 (ThermoFisher Scientific) was used
according to the manufacturer’s instructions and served as control for transfection.
Cell migration. To study the ability of APA-miR-34a-PLK1-siRNA polyplex to
inhibit the migration of PDAC cells, we used the IncuCyte ZOOM Live Cell
Imaging system (Essen BioScience). Cells were plated onto 96-well ImageLock
tissue culture plate (60,000 MiaPaCa2 and 30,000 KPC cells per well) in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine and were allowed to grow until
confluency (37 °C; 5% CO2). Then, treatments of APA-miRNA–siRNA (100 nM
miRNA, 50 nm siRNA) polyplexes were added to the cells for 20 h. Next, a wound
was created in each well using a 96-pin wound-making tool (WoundMaker, Essen
BioScience), dislodged cells were washed with DMEM medium and treatments
were re-added. To monitor wound closer, the plate was placed in the IncuCyte
incubator and phase contrast images were taken at regular intervals over a course
of 48 h using ×10 objective. Results were calculated by the IncuCyte Software and
presented as wound confluence relative to time 0 or as relative wound density
(which accounts for changes in cell densities inside and outside the wound region
relative to the background density of the wound at time 0).
Colony formation. PDAC cells were transfected with APA (3.5 μg ml−1) polyplexes
containing miR-34a/non targeted negative control (NC)-miR/ PLK1-siRNA/non
targeted negative control (NC)-siRNA (100 nM) alone or combined, or left
untreated, for 24 h. Transfected cells were reseeded in 35 mm plates (250 cells per
plate for KPC, 500 cells per plate for MiaPaCa2 and 1000 cells per plate for Panc1
and BxPC3) in triplicates. Cells were allowed to grow for 8–14 days, then, plates
were washed with PBS, stained with crystal violet for 30 min, washed with DDW
and photographed. Quantification of colonies area was done using ImageJ software
and presented as total area.

 Human PBMCs isolation and cytokine ELISA. Fresh human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from leukocyte enriched whole blood of
healthy donors obtained from Sheba Medical Center Blood Bank. Informed con-
sent was obtained from all blood donors used in these studies. Whole blood was
diluted with RPMI 1640 (1:1 ratio). The diluted blood was gently overlaid onto
10 ml Ficoll (GE Healthcare) at 1:2 ratio. Gradients were centrifuged at 22 °C,
900×g, for 25 min. Opaque-light PBMCs ring was transferred into a new tube,
washed with RPMI and centrifuged at 800×g for 10 min. PBMCs (3 × 106) were
seeded in 12-well plates (1 ml per sample) and cultured in triplicates in RPMI 1640
medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-Glutamine, 1 mM pyruvate, 1%
non-essential amino acids, 100 U ml−1 penicillin and 100 μg ml−1 streptomycin.
Treatments of APA-siRNA (50 and 200 nM) polyplexes were added to PBMCs.
APA alone was used as vehicle control. PBMCs growth medium served as negative
control. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS, 2 µg ml−1, Sigma-Aldrich) served as positive
control. Culture supernatants were collected after 24 h and assayed for human
interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) cytokines by sand-
wich ELISA kits (R&D Systems).
Hemolysis assay. Rat red blood cells (RBC) solution (2% wt/wt) was added to a
96-well plate and incubated with serial dilutions (1–10,000 µg ml−1) of APA:
miRNA polyplexes (N/P 2) for 1 h at 37 °C. The highest polyplex concentration
used in this assay (10,000 µg ml−1), was 100-fold higher than the one used in the
in vivo experiment (100 μg ml−1 polymer for 3 mg kg−1 oligonucleotide dose in
2 ml mouse blood volume). Following plate centrifugation, the supernatants were
transferred to a new plate and absorbance was measured at 550 nm using a
SpectraMax M5e plate reader (Molecular Devices). Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)
was used as positive control, whereas dextran (Mw 70 kDa, Sigma-Aldrich) was
used as negative control.
Polyplex stability in serum. To determine the ability of APA nanocarrier to
stabilize miRNA against serum degradation, APA-miR-34a polyplexes were incu-
bated with 100% FBS for 12 h at 37 °C and run on 2% agarose gel. miRNA bands
were digitized and quantified using ImageJ software to determine the mean density
of the miRNA bands.
Generation of mCherry-labeled human PDAC MiaPaCa2 cell line. mCherry-
labeled MiaPaCa2 cell line was generated as previously described58. Briefly, human
embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells were co-transfected with pQC-mCherry
and the compatible packaging plasmids, pMD.G.VSVG and pGag.pol.gpt. Forty-
eight h following transfection, pQC-mCherry retroviral particles-containing
supernatants were collected and filtered (0.45 µm). Cells were infected with the
retroviral particles-containing media and mCherry positive cells were selected 48 h
following the infection by puromycin (9 µg ml−1) resistance.
Animal studies. All animals were housed in Tel Aviv University’s animal facility
and the experiments were approved by our institutional animal care and use
committee (IACUC) and conducted in accordance with NIH guidelines. For
orthotopic cell inoculation, severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) male mice
(Envigo) aged 5 weeks were anesthetized using ketamine (100 mg kg−1) and xyla-
zine (12 mg kg−1) and a subcostal left incision of 1 cm in the skin and in the
peritoneum was done. The pancreas was exposed and 1 × 106 mCherry-labeled
MiaPaCa2 cells suspended in 20 μl PBS were injected into the pancreas using a
Hamilton syringe with a 30 G needle. The incision was closed with a 5–0 nylon
monofilament suture. At the end of the surgery, mice received Rimadyl (100 μl per
25 g body weight) for pain relief and were monitored until recovery. Tumor growth
was monitored twice a week using an intravital non-invasive fluorescence imaging
system (Maestro, Cambridge Research and Instrumentation). For maximum tol-
erated dose (MTD) experiment, Balb/c mice, body weight- 25 g, were injected with
increasing amounts of APA-miRNA–siRNA polyplexes dosages and monitored for
general health in the 5 following weeks. To assess the polyplexes effect on mouse
normal pancreas and on glucose levels in mouse blood, 5-week-old male C57BL/6
mice were injected with APA-miRNA–siRNA (2 mg kg−1 oligonucleotide dose)
polyplexes 3 sequential injections. At various time points, blood glucose levels were
measured from the mice tail by a glucometer. The mice were anesthetized and
pancreas was resected, embedded in paraffin and stained with Hematoxylin and
Eosin. For antitumor activity of APA-miRNA–siRNA polyplexes, mice bearing
orthotopic tumors were randomized and divided into 5 treatment groups, each
group with an average mCherry tumor signal of ~100 scaled counts per s: (i) PBS
(n = 7), (ii) APA-miR-34a/PLK1-siRNA (n = 7), (iii) APA-miR-34a/NC-siRNA (n
= 6), (iv) APA-PLK1-siRNA/NC-miR (n = 6) and (v) APA-NC-miR/NC-siRNA (n
= 6). miR-34a/NC-miR were from Biospring and PLK1-siRNA/NC-siRNA were
from Syntezza Bioscience. The mice were injected intravenously five consecutive
times, for two cycles with a 3 days break between them with total of 3 mg kg−1
oligonucleotide dose per treatment. In all animal studies, mice were monitored
twice a week for general health, body weight and tumor signal in a non-blinded
manner. At day 40 from tumor inoculation, blood was withdrawn from mice and
analyzed for blood count and chemistry (American Medical Laboratories).
mCherry-labeled tumor-bearing mice imaging. Tumor formation and progres-
sion was monitored twice a week by a non-invasive fluorescence imaging system
(CRI-Maestro). The mice were anesthetized, treated with depilatory cream and
placed inside the imaging system. Multispectral image-cubes were acquired
through 550–800 nm spectral range in 10 nm steps using excitation (595 nm long
pass) and emission (645 nm long pass) filter set. The mice auto-fluorescence and
undesired background signals were eliminated by spectral analysis and linear
unmixing algorithm of the CRI-Maestro software.
APA:Cy5-labeled siRNA polyplex biodistribution. For co-localization: mice
bearing orthotopic mCherry-labeled MiaPaCa2 tumors with a fluorescent signal of
~1000 scaled counts per second were administered via the tail vein with APA: Cy5-
labeled siRNA polyplexes (N/P 2, 0.5 mg kg−1 siRNA, 100 µl). Mice were imaged
over time and Cy5 fluorescent signal from whole body was measured using the
CRI-Maestro imaging system. Co-localization of mCherry and Cy5 was determined
by the CRI-Maestro software. For biodistribution: tumors and healthy organs
(heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, and spleen) were resected from mice 24 h following i.v.
injection of either the APA:Cy5-labeled siRNA polyplex or Cy5-labeled siRNA
alone and fluorescent intensity of each organ was measured in the CRI-Maestro.
Immunohistochemistry. FFPE samples of tumors were sectioned at 5 μm thick-
ness, mounted on positively charged glass slides and dried for 30 min at 37 °C. One
section per sample was deparaffinized, rehydrated, and stained with hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E). Additional sections were immunostained using the automated
immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization staining system Bond RX
(Leica Biosystems). First, sections were submitted to heat-induced epitope retrieval
with Epitope Retrieval solution 1 (ER1, AR9961, Leica Biosystems) for 20 min.
Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3–4% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide
(part of DS9263, Leica Biosystems) for 12 min. Afterward, sections were incubated
with goat blocking serum (Biological Industries) for 35 min. Then, staining was
performed using Intense R Detection system (Leica Biosystems) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Primary antibody incubation time was 1 h. Sections were
stained for proliferating cells using rabbit anti- Ki67 antibody (1:200, cat#
RBK027–05, Zytomed), apoptotic cells using rabbit anti-cleaved caspase 3 antibody
(1:100; cat# CP229A, Biocare Medical) and microvessels using rat anti- CD31
antibody (1:20, cat# DIA310, Dianova). Sections were also stained with rabbit anti-
PLK1 (1:50, cat# bs-3535R, Bioss Antibodies), rabbit anti-MYC (1:100, cat# 10828-
1-AP, Proteintech) and mouse anti-αSMA (1:300, cat# A2547, Sigma-Aldrich).
Microvessel density (MVD) was calculated as previously described59. Briefly,
tumors were scanned for areas of high vessel density (i.e., “hot spots”) at low power.
Then, individual microvessels were counted at a higher power (×400 field). Vessels
with an open lumen that, in most cases, contained red blood cells were defined as
vessels positively stained for CD31, and counted at high power (×400 field).
Staining intensities of Ki67, cleaved caspase 3, PLK1 and MYC from tumor sections
were determined using ImageJ software with Fiji plugin60 (downloaded from http://
fiji.sc).
Vasculature/stroma morphologies of PDAC xenograft and normal murine
pancreas. To monitor PDAC xenograft and normal pancreas vasculatures, we
administered i.v. FITC-labeled dextran (70 KDa, 10 mg ml−1, 200 μl) to orthotopic
tumor-bearing mice. Then, the pancreas was exposed and vasculature functionality
and morphology were monitored by a fiber confocal microscopy imaging system
(CellVizio, Mauna Kea Technologies). Mean Vessel Diameter (MVD) of blood
vessels within PDAC tumor and normal pancreas and fluorescent signal in areas
outside the vessels were measured using the CellVizio imaging Software (Mauna
Kea Technologies). Blood vessels and activated fibroblasts in PDAC tumor xeno-
graft and normal pancreas were immunostained using anti-CD31 and anti-αSMA
antibodies, respectively (see IHC section).
Statistical methods. Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) for
in vitro assays and as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) for in vivo assays.
Statistical analyses were performed with Student’s t-test unless noted otherwise.
Statistical significance in mice OS was determined by the log-rank test using Sig-
maPlot software (Systat Software Inc.). The P-values are *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and
***P < 0.001. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
