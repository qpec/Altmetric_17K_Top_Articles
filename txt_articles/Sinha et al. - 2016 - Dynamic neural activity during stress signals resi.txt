Active coping underlies a healthy stress response, but neural pro-
cesses supporting such resilient coping are not well-known. Using a
brief, sustained exposure paradigm contrasting highly stressful,
threatening, and violent stimuli versus nonaversive neutral visual
stimuli in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study,
we show significant subjective, physiologic, and endocrine increases
and temporally related dynamically distinct patterns of neural acti-
vation in brain circuits underlying the stress response. First, stress-
specific sustained increases in the amygdala, striatum, hypothalamus,
midbrain, right insula, and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)
regions supported the stress processing and reactivity circuit. Sec-
ond, dynamic neural activation during stress versus neutral runs,
showing early increases followed by later reduced activation in
the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), dorsal anterior cingulate
cortex (dACC), left DLPFC, hippocampus, and left insula, suggested a
stress adaptation response network. Finally, dynamic stress-specific
mobilization of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VmPFC), marked
by initial hypoactivity followed by increased VmPFC activation,
pointed to the VmPFC as a key locus of the emotional and behav-
ioral control network. Consistent with this finding, greater neural
flexibility signals in the VmPFC during stress correlated with active
coping ratings whereas lower dynamic activity in the VmPFC also
predicted a higher level of maladaptive coping behaviors in real life,
including binge alcohol intake, emotional eating, and frequency of
arguments and fights. These findings demonstrate acute functional
neuroplasticity during stress, with distinct and separable brain net-
works that underlie critical components of the stress response, and a
specific role for VmPFC neuroflexibility in stress-resilient coping.

U
npredictable and uncontrollable events are highly common in
daily life, and our cognitive and behavioral coping responses
are central to determining the long-term negative or positive effects
of stress on health. Consider the following example. You are in the
underground on your way to give a critical presentation at a large
meeting and the train stops. There is no information on what has
happened and the phone signal is down. We almost instantaneously
begin to consider options of what to do: Perhaps seek out someone
in authority or, alternatively, quickly without much thought push
alarm buttons to get out. Active coping (involving strategies such as
altering perception via appraisal strategies, reframing or reasoning,
exercising cognitive and behavioral control, and problem solving
during stress) signals resilience and regulates stress to promote
adaptive behaviors and positive health outcomes (1–3). On the
other hand, extensive research documents that poor emotional and
behavioral coping (using avoidance, suppression, rumination, and
habitual motivation during stress) is associated with a number of
maladaptive health behaviors and poor health outcomes (3–7).
Despite this evidence, the specific neural components of the stress
response that may underlie acute stress reactivity, adaptation, and
active coping that support stress resilience mechanisms in humans
are not well-understood.
Growing basic science research suggests that there is an evo-
lutionary bias toward reduced prefrontal executive control dur-
ing high stress to promote short-term stress-related habitual
behavioral responses for survival (8–11). A host of human
functional neuroimaging and behavioral laboratory studies doc-
ument decreased prefrontal activity and reduced executive
function during stress (9, 12, 13) and increased activation in the
limbic-striatal network associated with high emotional and be-
havioral reactivity in healthy and patient samples (13–17).
Nonetheless, humans often face high levels of stress, trauma, and
aggression in daily life, but they also show a remarkable ability to
adapt and reduce stress levels and actively cope and persist in the
face of such unpredictable and uncontrollable events, which has
led to an increasing focus on identifying brain responses to stress
and stress resilience mechanisms that may drive individual dif-
ferences in stress coping and stress-related negative sequelae (11,
18, 19).
Although previous neuroimaging research has documented
increased brain limbic-striatal activation during stress, with evi-
dence of reduced ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VmPFC) or
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) response, these func-
tional responses may represent an initial and early neural stress
response as shown by research using event-related presentation
of aversive images or very brief block presentation of movie clips
or trauma/stress imagery to assess neural stress responses (14, 17,
20). Thus, few studies have focused on the acute temporal dy-
namics of the limbic-striatal responses and the prefrontal cortical
responses to stress or how the brain may dynamically adapt to
reduce and respond to acute stress in the moment. For example,
Significance
We live in a time of increasing terror, stress, and trauma, and yet
humans show a remarkable ability to cope under high stress
states. How the brain supports such active resilient coping is not
well-understood. Findings showed high stress levels are ac-
companied by dynamic brain signals in circuits representing the
stress reaction, adaptation, and behavioral control responses. In
addition, a ventromedial prefrontal cortical region showed ini-
tial decreases in brain activation, but then mobilized with in-
creased activation, and this dynamic change was correlated with
active coping. Conversely, individuals who failed to show such
“neuroflexibility” in this specific ventromedial prefrontal region
reported higher maladaptive coping behaviors. Findings suggest
that strategies to promote such neuroflexibility under stress
may increase stress resilience in humans.

 research in laboratory animals has shown plasticity in the
VmPFC, encompassing the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and rostral
anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and subgenual cingulate regions,
as a key locus of the emotional and behavioral control network for
regaining behavioral control during uncontrollable stress (18, 19).
Human neuroimaging evidence suggests that the VmPFC is a key
region of the adaptive behavioral coping circuit that plays a role in
increased persistence responses in the face of uncontrollable set-
backs (21) and in regulation of anxious emotion (22). Disrupted
VmPFC signaling during stress also predicts alcohol relapse and
failed recovery from alcoholism (23). Childhood trauma, cumu-
lative adversity, and a history of mood disorders or posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) are each associated with blunted VmPFC
activation during emotion or stress exposure, and disrupted
VmPFC connectivity with amygdala is suggestive of poor adaptive
coping (13, 14, 16, 24, 25). On the other hand, it is plausible that
brief, sustained stress exposure may provide an approach to as-
sess more automatic neural processes that underlie stress adap-
tive and resilient coping responses. Based on this evidence,
we hypothesized that the VmPFC is one of the critical loci of
neuroplasticity in a resilience-coping network that signals in-
creased emotional and behavioral control and active coping even
in the face of continued stress exposure. We developed a para-
digm involving sustained unpredictable exposure to novel highly
stressful stimuli and also hypothesized sustained increases in the
stress reactivity and distress-signaling circuit involving the amyg-
dala, hippocampus, and hypothalamic responses during stress
exposure. Furthermore, because the VmPFC is anatomically
connected to other executive and attentional control regions,
such as the DLPFC and the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) that
are part of the resilience-coping network, we also predicted that
the VmPFC response will increase functional connectivity be-
tween these regions during stress relative to neutral (S-N) condi-
tions. In addition, because the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) is
modulated by glucocorticoids that in turn impact motivated
behavioral responses (26, 27), we further hypothesized that
stress-induced cortisol release will be associated not only with
functional changes in stress reactivity network regions, such as
the hypothalamus, amygdala. and hippocampus, but also with
the reduced medial prefrontal activity previously documented
during stress and emotion exposure. Finally, because humans
vary significantly in how they cope under stress and their as-
sociated behavioral responses, we used an individual differ-
ence approach to assess whether dynamic changes in VmPFC
response during stress will be associated with a subject’s reports of
emotional and behavioral coping.
Results
Thirty community young adult participants (mean age 25.7 (8.61) y
with no history of physical or mental health disorders participated
in a multimethod functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
scan involving a brief and passive sustained provocation procedure
to assess separable and distinct temporally related neural pro-
cesses involved in the stress response and in active coping. The
fMRI paradigm involved brief successive exposure to a block of
highly aversive images of terror, violence, mutilation, fear, disgust,
and desperation that were compared with a no-stress, neutral
control block involving nonaversive neutral images [all pictures
from the International Affective Picture System (28)]; each image
of the stress/neutral block was presented for 5 s per image with a
1-s interstimulus interval (ISI), over six successive runs of 60 s each
(10 images per run) making up each of the stress and neutral
blocks to provoke sustained unpredictable emotional stress versus
a brief sustained no-stress control state. Each stress and neutral
block was preceded by three 60-s runs of gray fixation baseline
blocks (29) for comparison with the respective stress or neutral
runs. The order of stress and neutral blocks was randomly assigned
and counterbalanced across subjects. Participants made subjective
ratings of stressfulness and arousal after each 60-s run; heart rate
was assessed continuously using a pulse oximeter; and plasma
cortisol levels were assessed via a previously inserted i.v. line for
repeated assessment at a baseline time point : prior to baseline
runs, immediately after the 6-min run block, and at 4 min after
each of the stress/neutral blocks (see Fig. 1A and SI Appendix for
detailed task description).
Self-Report and Physiologic, Endocrine, and Neural Response to Stress.
Significant main effects of condition (stress versus neutral) indicated
sustained increases in subjective stress [condition main effect,
F(1,29) = 894.91, P < 0.0001] and arousal [condition main effect,
F(1,29) = 198.12, P < 0.0001] ratings, increased average heart
rate [condition main effect, F(1,28) = 4.51, P < 0.03] and plasma
cortisol response [condition main effect, F(1,26) = 3.73, P =
0.05] during stress vs. no-stress blocks (Fig. 1 B, i–iv),
thereby validating that a brief and sustained stress state was
provoked relative to the neutral no-stress condition. There
were no significant condition × time point interactions for heart
rate and cortisol, and thus averaged responses across time
points in each condition are shown in Fig. 1 B, iii and iv. Whole
brain random effects analysis of variance (ANOVA) analyses
using AFNI software (30) assessed condition main effects
that contrasted the stress (stress runs − stress baseline runs)
versus neutral condition (neutral runs − neutral baseline runs)
and condition × time period (early, mid, and late runs, each
relative to their respective baseline) interaction effects in
all brain analyses comparing stress versus neutral run blocks.
Findings indicated a main effect of condition, with signifi-
cant increases in neural activity during stress vs. no-stress
conditions in cortico-limbic striatal regions, including the hy-
pothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, ventral and
dorsal striatum, insula and midtemporal regions, dorsal anterior
cingulate cortex, DLPFC, and the midbrain regions [P < 0.05
whole brain corrected (WBC); large effect sizes over 1.0]. In
addition, during only stress relative to baseline, significant
VmPFC deactivation and increased activity in the ventrolat-
eral prefrontal regions (VLPFC) were observed (P < 0.05,
WBC) (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). Sustained stress neural re-
sponses in specific representative limbic regions of interest
(ROIs) of the amygdala and hypothalamus relative to activa-
tion in the neutral condition across runs are presented in SI

 Whole Brain Association with Stress-Related Increases in Cortisol. To
further examine the coordinated neural and neuroendocrine
response, whole brain regression analysis of the plasma cortisol
response during the S vs. N condition was conducted. Cortisol
increases (S-N) were associated with decreased VmPFC re-
sponse (r = −0.68; R2 = 0.47) and increased hypothalamus (r =
0.65; R2 = 0.43), right (R) amygdala/hippocampus (r = 0.72; R2 =
0.52) and ventral striatum (r = 0.61; R2 = 0.38) S-N whole
brain response (P < 0.05 WBC) [Fig. 2 and see SI Appendix, Table
S2 for Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates].
Secondary analyses showed that sex did not influence these
significant effects.
Dynamic Temporal Changes in Stress/Neutral Brain Activation. Significant
condition (stress/neutral) by time period (early two, mid two, late
two runs) interaction effects indicated that dynamic changes in
neural activation in the late relative to early runs during stress versus
neutral were observed in the VmPFC, ventral striatum (VS), left (L)
insula, midbrain, L VLPFC, R hippocampus, temporal lobe, and L
precuneus/IPL regions (P < 0.05, WBC; large effect sizes were seen
for these activation clusters ranging from d = 1.21 to 1.85 (Fig. 3).
(Also see SI Appendix, Fig. S2 and Table S3 for MNI coordinates of
specific regions showing significant interaction effects across run
comparisons and conditions.) Furthermore, secondary analyses
showed that sex did not significantly influence these whole brain
interaction effects. The time courses of these dynamic functional
activations for representative and key specific ROIs are illustrated
for the VmPFC and ventral striatum across runs in Fig. 3 B, i and ii
(also see SI Appendix, Fig. S2). Interestingly, we found that the
VmPFC showed significant deactivation in the early period (runs 1–2
relative to stress baseline) and then a remarkable recovery in the late
period (runs 5–6 relative to the stress baseline) whereas the neutral
condition runs showed minimal change in the early runs and a
nonsignificant reduction in the later runs compared with the neutral
baseline (Fig. 3 B, i). Remarkably, the VS (Fig. 3 B, ii) showed no
changes in the early stress runs but a significant increase during the
late period, relative to changes in the neutral runs, resulting in an
overall interaction effect (Fig. 3A, columns 2 and 3). In contrast, we
also found an opposite dynamic response (Fig. 3 A and B, iii and iv)
during stress in the L VLPFC, L insula, bilateral middle temporal
lobe (MTL), and R hippocampus, with increases in neural activity
during the early period, followed by reduced activation during the
late stress period relative to no statistically significant change from
baseline in the early versus late runs of the neutral condition (Fig. 3A,
column 2), thereby suggestive of an adaptive or habituation network
representing the stress adaptation response.
Ventromedial PFC Functional Connectivity During Stress. As hypothesized,
we expected the VmPFC activation to show dynamic changes during
stress and to show increased connectivity with other executive and
attentional control regions during S vs. N states. To test this hy-
pothesis, we extracted the functional VmPFC response during aver-
aged stress response across all runs to assess functional connectivity
with the rest of the brain during stress versus neutral average and
stress compared with neutral conditions across all runs. We found
increased functional connectivity between the VmPFC and the L
anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC) and the DLPFC [Brodmann area
(BA) 9 and 10] and IPL regions during S-N condition (P < 0.05
whole brain corrected), indicating increased connectivity with ex-
ecutive control and attention regions in the face of continued
stress (Fig. 4). On the other hand, we found negative inhibitory
connectivity between the VmPFC and limbic and striatal regions
of the amygdala, hippocampus, striatum, and insula but no dif-
ferential connectivity between these regions across the stress and
neutral conditions (SI Appendix, Fig. S3). The increased VmPFC
connectivity with aPFC/DLPFC and IPL did not correlate with
active coping or coping behaviors.
VmPFC Plasticity and Individual Differences in Coping. To test the hy-
pothesis that the dynamic responses in VMPFC contribute to sig-
nificant variations in stress coping, we used an individual differences
approach to assess whether individual differences in VmPFC plas-
ticity was associated with active coping and maladaptive coping
behaviors. In a separate session, all subjects completed assessments
on real life coping responses and also reported on common coping
behaviors (such as emotional eating and frequency and number of
alcohol drinks consumed) and on the frequency of interpersonal
arguments and fights (see SI Appendix for description of these

 measures). The dynamic increase in VmPFC response during stress
as shown in Fig. 3 B, i and presented in Fig. 5A (extracted beta
weights from mean peak VmPFC increase in run 6 − mean lowest
VmPFC response in run 2) was significantly associated with higher
active coping scores (r = 0.47, R2 = 0.22, P = 0.01). Conversely,
blunted change in the VmPFC during stress, representing failure of
VmPFC neuroplasticity, was associated with greater emotional
eating (P = 0.02), higher maximum amount of alcohol consumed
per occasion (P < 0.0007), and increased frequency of interpersonal
arguments and fights (P < 0.005) (Fig. 5). We also assessed whether
the online average stressfulness and arousal ratings correlated with
heart rate, with cortisol, and with VmPFC neuroplasticity. We
found moderately significant positive correlations between VmPFC
neuroplasticity and average stressfulness (r = 0.40, P < 0.03) and
arousal (r = 0.45, P < 0.01) ratings. There were no significant cor-
relations between heart rate and cortisol during stress and online
stress and arousal ratings.
Discussion
Using a brief, sustained exposure paradigm in a stress versus no-
stress neutral experiment, we demonstrated significant subjective,
physiological, and endocrine stress responses, along with temporally
related, dynamically distinct and separable patterns of neural acti-
vation in brain circuits underlying the stress response. First, sus-
tained increases in the amygdala, striatum, hypothalamus, midbrain,
R insula, and R dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) regions
were observed, suggesting a neural pattern consistent with a stress
reactivity and processing circuit representing the distress-signaling
component of the stress response. A second neural pattern with
dynamic temporally related changes during stress versus neutral
showed early increases followed by later reductions in activation in
the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), dorsal anterior cin-
gulate cortex (dACC), L DLPFC, hippocampus, and insula that
pointed to a stress adaptation response network. Finally, opposite to
the previous pattern, we found a mobilization of the VmPFC and
VS response during stress marked by initial hypoactivity in VmPFC
and no change in the VS, followed by increased VmPFC and VS
activation in later runs, relative to the neutral response, supporting
previous basic science research and our hypothesis that the VmPFC
is a key region of a dynamic and flexible neural circuit that may
underlie behavioral control and active, resilient coping.
Previous animal and human data indicate that psychosocial stress
disrupts prefrontal and attentional circuits underlying executive
functioning and cognitive coping and that there is significant brain
plasticity such that these disruptions are reversible with stress removal
(9). In addition, the VmPFC has been found to modulate behavioral
control over stress (18) and is important for various affective and
behavioral coping [including somatomotor control (31), behavioral
flexibility (32), regulation of negative emotion and anxiety (22, 33),
and persistence in the face of setbacks (21)] and in integrating these
signals for appropriate decision-making and goal-directed behaviors
(34). This previous work led us to specifically hypothesize that the
VmPFC is a key locus in the behavioral control and resilience-coping
network. In further support of this hypothesis, the average
stress-specific VmPFC response across all runs resulted in pos-
itive strengthening connectivity with average activation in other key
prefrontal cortical networks, such as the aPFC/DLPFC and atten-
tional regions such as the IPL known to underlie executive attention
and cognitive control. The aPFC/DLPFC and IPL are coactivated
during working memory (35), and their role in cognitive control and
executive attentional processes required for goal-directed behaviors
and control of intended actions has been demonstrated (6, 36). Given
the findings of dynamic mobilization of the VmPFC activation, we
specifically tested whether this region in the coping network corre-
lates with active coping and coping behaviors. We found that active
coping self-report scores were positively correlated with VmPFC
functional plasticity and, conversely, that failure of VmPFC plasticity
was associated with maladaptive coping behaviors (greater reporting
of emotional eating, binge alcohol consumption, and higher
frequency of arguments and fights). Although these maladaptive
coping behaviors may seem disparate at first, an underlying aspect of
these maladaptive behaviors encompasses emotion dysregulation
and/or loss of self-control, processes known to contribute to emotional
and behavioral self-regulation (34, 37, 38). Together, the current
findings indicate that VmPFC neuroplasticity during stress plays a
significant role in adaptive and resilient coping.
The brief, sustained exposure task required participants to pro-
vide ongoing subjective stressfulness and arousal ratings using a
button box, but not to actively regulate or reduce their stress levels
or alter their stress via specific responses. Interestingly, we found
a significant positive association between the dynamic VmPFC re-
sponse during stress representing active coping and average stress-
fulness and arousal ratings. Although seeming counterintuitive at
first glance, these positive associations may represent the conscious
process of increasing interoceptive and subjective awareness of
stress signals as an initial step toward regaining perceived and be-
havioral control over stress in healthy individuals. Increasing
awareness of stress and emotions and appraisal of stress and
emotional stimuli are key components of emotion regulation (37,
39) and are in contrast to the more quick and “autopilot” type of
responding and emotion dysregulation associated with high stress
states (40). Further support for this interpretation comes from the
growing evidence indicating the use of mindfulness strategies that
focus on increasing awareness of the perceptual and internal state as

 a strategy for increasing perceived and behavioral control over
stress, pain, depression, and other stress-related conditions (41, 42).
Along with stress-related VmPFC plasticity, we found the ven-
tral striatum to increase during late relative to early runs in the
stress versus neutral contrast, consistent with its role in avoidant
learning and motivation (43, 44). There are also direct connections
between the VmPFC and the VS to facilitate processing of salient
aversive and appetitive stimuli, reinforcement learning, and moti-
vation for action and response selection (43, 45, 46). This research
is consistent with the coordinated increase in activity seen in both
the VmPFC and VS during the late runs of S vs. N exposure.
In addition to the distinct and separable dynamic VmPFC and
VS activation suggestive of a neural circuit for active and resilient
coping, we found evidence for two additional distinct patterns of
neural activity underlying additional key components of the stress
response (38, 47). First, sustained activity throughout the S vs. N
period in regions including the amygdala, hippocampus, hypothal-
amus, thalamus, anterior insula, dorsal striatum, and midbrain was
found. These regions make up the well-known limbic and striatal
brain circuit underlying stress perception, experience, and conscious
processing of stress (15). Because participants were viewing pre-
viously unseen aversive and highly stressful stimuli, these sustained
increases may be representative of the stress “alarm” signal of the
acute stress response to not only signal distress but also mobilize the
habit circuit involving the dorsal striatum (12, 13). In addition,
sustained increased right lateralized activity was also observed in
regions involved in integrative processing and monitoring of nega-
tive emotional stimuli (e.g., anterior cingulate) (48) and in regions
involved in cognitive appraisal and working memory (e.g.,
DLPFC) (25, 35) (shown in Fig. S1), suggesting that such cog-
nitive processing of distress plays a key role in the brain stress
reactivity and stress-signaling response in healthy individuals.
We also found that increased cortisol response to stress was
positively associated with key limbic striatal regions involved in
glucocorticoid stress-signaling regions such as the hypothalamus,
amygdala/hippocampus (49, 50), and ventral striatum (51–53)
whereas a highly significant negative association with the rostral
ACC (rACC, BA 10 and 32) extending into the OFC (BA 11) of the
VmPFC was observed. Of note, the center of mass for this negative
association was more dorsal in the rACC than the center of the
VmPFC dynamic activation. However, the extent of the negative
association cluster extended ventrally into the dynamic VmPFC
activation region (SI Appendix, Table S3). Acute stress-related in-
creases in glucocorticoids are critical both for the alarm signal as
well as in regaining control over the stress signal resulting in healthy
stress coping. Recent animal data show a glucocorticoid role in
modulation of the medial PFC involved in goal-directed behaviors
(54). Interestingly, the highly significant negative association be-
tween stress-related cortisol increases and reduced rACC/VmPFC
was for the S-N average rACC/VmPFC response and not for the
dynamic changes that were found to be correlated with active
coping. It follows then that those individuals showing lower dynamic
activity and thus more maladaptive coping were likely to have
higher cortisol reactivity. However, cortisol change did not directly
predict coping behaviors, suggesting that individual differences in
dynamic neural stress responses in the VmPFC-related behavioral
control circuit may mediate the link between glucocorticoids and
coping behaviors, and future research to further explore this re-
lationship is warranted.
The final distinct neural stress pattern was a temporally related
activation showing significantly increased activation in the insula
and midtemporal regions, R ventral hippocampus, and L VLPFC in
the early runs, followed by dynamic changes with decreased ac-
tivity during the late runs during S vs. N conditions. Indeed, L
midtemporal, ventral hippocampus, and the VLPFC are involved in
processing interoceptive stress signals, matching to prior experience
and in semantic and nonverbal representation, integration, and
modulation (13). Although we did not predict dynamic decreases in
these specific regions, reduction in activation of these regions during
the later stress runs may represent acute neuroplasticity involved in
adapting and habituating to decrease the impact of the stress ex-
perience. Well-known cognitive and behavioral coping strategies
such as distraction, suppression, and mental distancing are often
used to adapt and decrease the stressful experience, and one may
speculate that the distinct temporally related decreases in neural
activity in these specific regions during stress may involve such
coping processes. Future studies that assess this neural component
of the stress response may provide further insights into the neural
mechanisms underlying stress-adaptive responses that reduce acute
experiencing of unpredictable and uncontrollable stressful events.
Although the above findings are informative, an important caveat
is that men constituted a minority of the sample, and thus the find-
ings are more generalizable to women than men. Although secondary
post hoc analyses did not show a significant influence of sex on dy-
namic neural responses, the smaller sample of men likely limited our
ability to adequately explore sex differences. Future studies with a
larger sample are needed to replicate current findings and to fully
assess any potential sex differences in neural stress responses.
Despite the limited generalizability to men, the results may have
clinical utility. Using a previously unused multimethod functional
neuroimaging approach, they provide evidence for distinct dynamic
neural activation consistent with acute functional neuroplasticity that
may play a role in regaining behavioral control to support resilient
coping during stress. The findings also suggest three related but
separable components of neural signaling during stress, involving the
VmPFC-related network playing a role in regaining perceptual and
behavioral control and decision making (34), a distinct cortico-
limbic-striatal circuit for stress perception, reactivity, and conscious
processing, and a stress adaptation circuit possibly for reducing and
adapting to the aversive stress experience (38). These components
of the stress response may have implications for identifying stress-
related vulnerabilities for mental and physical health disorders and
may also provide target neural measures for assessing intervention
effects. For example, blunted or disrupted VmPFC response has
been associated with PTSD (14, 25) and alcoholism relapse (13), and
also in depression and addiction and in individuals with high child-
hood trauma and cumulative adversity (13, 55, 56). However,
whether the stress pathophysiology in each of these disorders and
conditions was due to a failure of functional neuroplasticity in the
dynamic VmPFC network or the stress adaptation network during
stress, as shown in the current study, or due to an overreactivity or
inability to reduce stress reactivity, or both, is not clear. The findings
suggest the potential utility of the current experimental approach as
a neurobehavioral assay of stress reactivity and resilience coping in
testing novel behavioral and pharmacological strategies that may
reduce stress reactivity and/or improve resilient coping in indi-
viduals with maladaptive coping and in those with stress-related
disorders. On the other hand, the current experiment did not
assess response selection and instrumental actions during stress,
and future research is needed to understand and identify dynamic
brain processes that underlie stress-related response selection or
instrumental action and their link to coping behaviors.
Materials and Methods
Participants. Thirty right-handed, nonsmoking, community adults [73% women;
mean age = 25.7 (8.61) y; 76% Caucasian; years of education = 15.7 (2.17)] who
did not meet criteria for any psychiatric disorders, including substance use
disorders based on the assessment by the Structured Clinical Interview for

collection. The subject then completed a practice task consisting of 10 trials using
stimuli that were not used for the in-scan fMRI task. After a 45-min adaptation
period, the subject entered the MRI, and a pulse oximeter was placed on the
nondominant forefinger to obtain heart rate. The subject completed the func-
tional scan, and repeated blood draws via the i.v. line were also obtained. The brief,
sustained stress/neutral exposure task is presented in Fig. 1, and details about
the visual stimuli, task procedures, the subjective, physiological, and endocrine
measurements, assessment of coping behaviors, and the fMRI procedures
and data analyses are presented in SI Appendix.
