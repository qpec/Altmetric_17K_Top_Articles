SUMMARY
Human astrocytes network with neurons in dynamic ways that are still poorly defined. Our ability to model this relationship is hampered
by the lack of relevant and convenient tools to recapitulate this complex interaction. To address this barrier, we have devised efficient
coculture systems utilizing 3D organoid-like spheres, termed asteroids, containing pre-differentiated human pluripotent stem cell
(hPSC)-derived astrocytes (hAstros) combined with neurons generated from hPSC-derived neural stem cells (hNeurons) or directly
induced via Neurogenin 2 overexpression (iNeurons). Our systematic methods rapidly produce structurally complex hAstros and synap-
ses in high-density coculture with iNeurons in precise numbers, allowing for improved studies of neural circuit function, disease
modeling, and drug screening. We conclude that these bioengineered neural circuit model systems are reliable and scalable tools to accu-
rately study aspects of human astrocyte-neuron functional properties while being easily accessible for cell-type-specific manipulations
and observations.
INTRODUCTION
Astrocytes have numerous dynamic synapse-modulating
and homeostatic functions during development, matura-
tion, and disease (Blanco-Suarez et al., 2016; Verkhratsky
and Nedergaard, 2016). While most investigations into
these cellular functions have been conducted in rodent
models due to ease of experimental access, human astro-
cytes are known to have unique gene expression, morpho-
logical characteristics (Colombo et al., 1997b), and func-
tionality (Oberheim et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2016) that
may have consequences for higher brain circuit processing
in healthy and disease conditions (Krencik et al., 2016;
Oberheim Bush and Nedergaard, 2017). One strategy to
examine human cellular function is to study the interplay
between human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived as-
trocytes (hAstros) and hPSC-derived neurons (hNeurons).
We previously reported a long-term protocol consisting of
weekly dissociation of three-dimensional (3D) spheres of
hAstros, termed astrospheres, to induce developmental
maturation and purity followed by attachment onto two-
dimensional (2D) substrates for coculture studies (Krencik
et al., 2015; Krencik and Ullian, 2013; Krencik and Zhang,
2011). More recently, organoid approaches have been re-
ported to mature and maintain long-term glial-neuronal
interactions over many months within intact 3D spheres
(Pasca et al., 2015; Qian et al., 2016; Sloan et al., 2017).
Here, we detail an alternative fast and reliable protocol
to
recapitulate
these
3D
interactions
mirroring
the
complexity found in human brain. This method has the
ease and advantage of allowing precise control of both
the numbers and types of human neural cells using iden-
tical or different genetic backgrounds, as well as rapidly
inducing mature synapse formation.
To investigate human astroglial activity in a more native-
like environment, several innovative methods have been
recently devised. One approach was to engraft human fetal-
or hPSC-derived glial progenitors and hAstros into immu-
nodeficient rodents followed by in vivo and ex vivo analysis
(Chen et al., 2015; Han et al., 2013; Krencik et al., 2011; Li
et al., 2015). While this technique is advantageous for being
able to integrate cells into intact neural networks with
measurable behavioral output, there are at least two major
limitations. First, the human cellular response in a xeno-
species environment may be altered compared with integra-
tion within matched species (Goldman, 2016). Second, scal-
ability and optimization of conditions is impractical in
chimeric mice due to time, cost, and space limitations. To
overcome these issues, many human culture studies have
been recently conducted with 3D spheroids or organoids,

 as an improved technique over 2D monolayers, to maintain
structural integrity and tight cellular interactions (Kelava
and Lancaster, 2016; Simian and Bissell, 2017).
Typically in 3D cultures of human neural cells, hAstros
appear gradually over a long time period with no precise
experimental control over the number or maturity of cells
(Pasca et al., 2015; Qian et al., 2016; Sloan et al., 2017). The
neuronal population is also not well specified as they
contain a mixture of progenitor and mature neuronal sub-
types. In an ideal experimental neural coculture system,
the ratio of glial to neuronal cells as well as the extracellular
milieu should be stable over time to better mimic the long-
term nervous system environment during normal and
disease conditions. Therefore, we aimed to develop such
systematic and repeatable coculture methods to rapidly
mimic many aspects of the endogenous cell-cell interac-
tions. This system described here can be applied for study-
ing cell-autonomous versus cell non-autonomous effects
by combining cells from different genetic backgrounds or
treatment conditions. Furthermore, it can be used as a sur-
rogate for monitoring cellular engraftment of human neu-
ral types as a model for cellular replacement therapy.
RESULTS
High-Density Neuronal Coculture Induces Complex
Human Astrocyte Morphology
In order to better recapitulate endogenous human astro-
cyte complexity, we compared the morphology of hAstros
in the absence or presence of neurons. One particular
disadvantage in using hNeurons for coculture studies is
that the population will also contain a mixture of undiffer-
entiated neuroepithelial cells and gliogenic progenitors,
typically in rosette structures, that generate immature syn-
aptogenic hAstros over time (Johnson et al., 2007). These
hPSC-derived ‘‘endogenous’’ glial cells will confound any
phenotypes observed in neuronal studies. To overcome
this, we utilized a clonal hPSC line with inducible expres-
sion of a transgene to generate Neurogenin 2 (NGN2)
protein, which rapidly generates homogeneous cortical
iNeurons after induction in a neural supportive medium
(Wang et al., 2017) (Figure 1A). We determined whether
pre-differentiated hAstros (>6 months, from embryonic
stem cell line WA09 and from previously characterized
induced pluripotent stem cell lines; Krencik et al., 2015)
were able to induce maturation of iNeurons in a 2-week
conventional 2D coculture as previously reported in
hNeurons (Krencik et al., 2011). As expected, hAstros
induced expression of a synapse-related gene, as measured
by a Synapsin 1-promoter-driven GFP reporter, and the
hAstros themselves become elongated and branched
(Figures S1A and 1B). However, this culture paradigm did
not induce the astrocytes to exhibit the morphological
complexity of astrocytes within the human brain.
We next examined if hAstro morphological complexity
could be enhanced in higher density cultures that are
more similar to endogenous conditions. During coculture
studies, we observed that hAstros tend to extend upon
neuronal processes (Movies S1 and S2). This surprisingly
also occurred, although to a lesser extent, when hAstros
were cultured on parallel carbon nanofibers without neu-
rons (Figure S1B). We therefore examined the morpholog-
ical response of hAstros to high densities of parallel-orien-
tated neuronal fibers using a membrane-targeted GFP
reporter (mGFP). To mimic neuronal tracts, we generated
organoid spheres of hPSC-derived neural progenitors
from the iNeuron line without induction of NGN2, seeded
spheres separated by a few hundred micrometers onto
Matrigel-coated glass, and then induced NGN2 expression
for 2 weeks to promote maturation and neuronal process
extension toward neighboring seeds (Figure 1C). Next, we
cultured pre-differentiated (>6 months) dissociated hAstros
on these tracts, or on Matrigel without neurons as a
control, for an additional 2 weeks. In comparison with
cultures in the absence of iNeurons, the coculture system
led to a dramatic restructuring of hAstros with increased
number
of
branches
(N
=
10
versus
11
technical
replicates for each, branches of WA09-derived hAstros
only versus hAstros + iNeurons; primary = 3.6 ± 0.7 versus
11.2 ± 1.4; secondary = 1.6 ± 0.6 versus 30.9 ± 3.6; tertiary =
0.2 ± 0.2 versus 11.2 ± 3.0). The overall area of total mem-
brane per cell was not different, yet total territory occupied
per hAstro was increased (5,379.6 ± 1,226.6 versus
10,994.7 ± 4,714.2 mm2) indicating membrane restructur-
ing with no change in total membrane content. In support
of this, the length of the maximum process was also
increased (79.5 ± 35.1 versus 145.2 ± 44.2 mm) (Figure 1D).
These data suggest that high-density neuronal axons
are sufficient to induce profound changes in hAstro
morphology and yield hAstros morphologically similar to
endogenous human white-matter-tract astrocytes.
Enhanced Astrocyte Complexity in a 3D Organotypic-
like Coculture Environment
Since increased neuronal process density appears to be
crucial to induce complex astrocyte morphology, we
next examined the effect of coculturing hAstros with a
high density of neurons in 3D tissue. We turned to the
method commonly utilized to maintain neural networks
of rodent or human tissue, termed organotypic cultures
(Humpel, 2015). We cultured neurospheres from the
iNeuron line for 2 weeks, and then seeded spheres upon
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membranes to generate
healthy organotypic-like cultures (with medium only in
contact with the lower surface for better gas exchange)
1746

 (Figure 2A). Compared with being submerged in medium
on glass coverslips coated with Matrigel, spheres readily
flattened as thick layers on membranes, and both condi-
tions led to complete neuronal differentiation with a
lack of rosette structures after NGN2 induction (Figure 2B).
To determine whether this environment would improve
the complexity of hAstros over that of the high-density
2D culture described above, we seeded mGFP-labeled as-
trospheres, containing solely hAstros, onto the organo-
typic-like iNeurons for a duration of 4 weeks. Surprisingly,
this culture system resulted in the presence of fine mem-
branous processes and dramatic branching reminiscent
of astrocytes within the human brain and not previ-
ously reported in vitro (Figure 2C). This morphological
complexity was observed to continuously increase be-
tween 3 and 9 weeks post engraftment, and fine leaflet-
like structures (reminiscent of perisynaptic astrocyte
processes) (Khakh and Sofroniew, 2015) could gradually
be observed (Figure 2D). Furthermore, hAstros distributed
into territories, displayed club-like bulbous endings and
produced long-projecting varicose processes through the
territories (Figures S1C and S1D), similar to unique fea-
tures observed within the human brain (Colombo et al.,
1997a; Oberheim et al., 2009). These data suggest that in
contrast to axons only, neuron cell bodies and dendrites
may promote a more ‘‘gray-matter’’-like appearance of
hAstros.
Asteroid Coculture System for Disease Modeling
We sought to optimize the emerging long-term 3D organoid
methods by coculturing a defined number of human astro-
cytesandneuronswhilemaintaining3Dstructureandextra-
cellular components. In order to achieve this system (which
we termed asteroids), we combined dissociated neural pro-
genitor cells and pre-matured hAstros at a 1:1 cell ratio.

 promoted sphereformation and survival (Figure3A). To con-
trol cell numbers, we stopped growth factor treatment of
hAstros before coculturing and induced neuronal progeni-
tors to convert to a pure population of iNeurons as observed
via TUBB3 (Figure 3B). After 35 days of coculture, immuno-
staining and 3D imaging revealed the continued presence
of hAstros evenly, yet randomly, throughout the asteroids,
dispersed into distinct territories among the iNeurons
(Figure 3C). In all cases, sparse mGFP labeling revealed com-
plex morphology, including fine-membrane processes pro-
jecting from individual GFAP-positive branches (Figure 3D).
To determine if this 3D environment enhances maturation
of astrocytes, we compared protein expression of a well-
known astrocyte maturation marker in astrospheres and
asteroids. Glutamate transporter GLT1 (also known as
EAAT2), which has been reported to upregulate in hAstros
post-rodent engraftment (Haidet-Phillips et al., 2014), had
increased labeling within the asteroids (Figure S1E).
To demonstrate the accessibility of this system and utiliza-
tion for future approaches such as imaging network commu-
nication, hAstros were pre-infected with lentivirus to stably
express a genetically encoded calcium indicator, GCaMP6,
and following coculture, calcium transients within hAstro
processes were observed without the need for cell-type-spe-
cific promoters (Figure S1F and Movie S3). Next, as a proof
of principle for synapse studies and disease modeling, we
generated asteroids containing pre-matured hAstros from a
Costello syndrome-specific induced hPSC line with an over-
activating mutation in HRAS (HRASG12S). As previously
described, HRASG12S hAstros have an increased synapto-
genicpotentialcomparedwithcellsgeneratedfromacontrol
line (HRASWT) (Krencik et al., 2015). First, we investigated
the ability of hAstros to induce the formation of synapses
within asteroids with or without induction of NGN2. We
measured the density of apposed pre- and post-synaptic
markers Synapsin 1 (SYN1) and PSD95, respectively, and
discovered an increased density of synapses in the coculture
group and furthermore with NGN2 induction at day 35

 with hAstros, p = 0.048; n = 3 independent replicates each)
(Figure 3E). Synaptic measurements were repeated with
hAstros generated from three non-related wild-type hPSC
biological replicate lines at 3 weeks (Figure S2A). In these
cultures, we were also able to detect perisynaptic astrocyte
processes utilizing the protein marker Ezrin (Lavialle et al.,
2011), which surrounded synaptic structures within aster-
oids, but were not observed in iNeurospheres (Figure S2B).
Lastly, the addition of HRASWT hAstros to the iNeurons in
3D asteroid cocultures increased apposed pre- and post-syn-
aptic markers SYN1 and Homer, yet, similar to the values we
reported previously (Krencik et al., 2015), we detected more
than a 50% increase in synapse density in the presence of
HRASG12S hAstros (no hAstros, HRASWT hAstros, HRASG12S
hAstro per 100 mm2, 91.7 ± 5.06, 174.3 ± 12.5, 301.67 ±
11.7, respectively; no hAstros to HRASWT, p = 0.007; no
hAstros to HRASG12S, p < 0.001; HRASWT to HRASG12S, p =
0.004; n = 3 independent replicates each) (Figure 3F). These
data reveal the asteroid coculture system to be an efficient
and innovative method to precisely investigate normal
and disease-relevant roles of astrocytes upon synapse forma-
tion in a 3D setting.
Finally, we sought to generate a more systematic andlarge-
scale bioengineering approach for 3D sphere production
rather than the random self-assembly method described
above (Figure S4A). We immediately induced NGN2 directly
from the hPSC line in 2D for 48 hr in neural medium and
then mixed these rapidly maturing progenitors after dissoci-
ation with equal numbers of mGFP-labeled post-mitotic
hAstros in microwell plates with Y-27632 to generate 3D
spheres ofspecific and consistentsizes (FigureS4B).The ratio
of neurons to astrocytes could be altered as desired before
sphereformation.Inaddition,toregulatemultiplesphereas-
sembly, we subsequently transferred the resultant asteroids
to either bioreactor spinner flasks to promote long-term
separation of spheres or to stationary flasks to allow fusion
through close physical contact (Figure 4A). This rapid
assembly method also produced hAstros with complex
morphology by 3 weeks as observed by confocal microscopy
andscanningelectronmicroscopy(Figures4B–4D).Notably,
similar to techniques reported for neurosphere organoids
(Bagley et al., 2017; Birey et al., 2017; Xiang et al., 2017),
this approach demonstrates the utility for investigating
long-range migration or signaling of astrocyte-neuron cir-
cuits from assembled spheres that were specified to different
brain regions, treated in different conditions, or generated
from differing genetic backgrounds.
DISCUSSION
How do human astrocytes contribute to local and long-
range neural circuit processing? Human explants have
been used to address this question, yet the scarcity of avail-
able tissue limits the utility of such systems and has led to
the emerging use of organoids and/or spheroid systems
from hPSCs. Unfortunately, the techniques to date are
extremely long and not yet systematic. The work presented
here provides an alternative approach with a rapid and
controllable technique to study the impact of human astro-
cyte-neuron interaction in various conditions. As 3D cul-
tures increase background noise during fluorescent imag-
ing compared with 2D monolayers, we plan to introduce
light sheet and other emerging technologies (Bindocci
et al., 2017) to achieve higher resolution during examina-
tion. With augmented complexity (e.g., addition of im-
mune or vascular cells, oligodendrocytes, or other neuronal
subtypes), these coculture systems can be further utilized
for brain modeling and posing questions about precise
cell-cell interactions. For example, do human astrocytes
induce oligodendrocytes to myelinate or maintain blood-
brain-barrier properties of endothelial cells in 3D condi-
tions? What is the relationship between human astrocytes
and microglia in synapse pruning and engulfment?
Human astrocytes have more overlap in their territorial
domains, project long processes through many layers of tis-
sue and have bulbous endings compared with their rodent
counterparts. Remarkably, these distinguishing features are
observed in the systems described here. Perisynaptic astro-
cyte processes have independent and dynamic responses to
local synaptic transmission in the form of calcium fluctua-
tions, yet the functional importance of these local phe-
nomena is still unclear (Bazargani and Attwell, 2016).
Because the coculture systems described here preserve
neuronal synapses in close association with vellate astro-
cyte processes, this will now allow for investigation into
how these long-process and fine-membrane components
influence and respond to neuronal activity.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Neural Differentiation and Processing
hAstros and hNeurons were differentiated from hPSCs (lines H9
[WA09], 13, 162D, 165D, and CS16) and characterized for cellular
identity as detailed previously (Krencik et al., 2011, 2015). iNeurons
were produced from a transgenic hPSC line by NGN2 induction via
(F) Costello syndrome-model hAstros (HRASG12S) significantly increase synaptic density within asteroids compared with wild-type control
(HRASWT) and no hAstro addition. Insets are magnified examples of synapses, including perisynaptic astrocyte processes. **p < 0.01;

 addition of 2 mg/mL doxycycline as described previously (Wang
et al., 2017). Astrospheres were supplemented with EGF and FGF2
(10 ng/mL each) before coculture experiments as detailed previ-
ously (Krencik and Zhang, 2011) and not forced to be mature or
reactive by the addition of exogenous factors. All coculture experi-
ments were conducted in neural medium consisting of DMEM/
F12 containing glutamax, sodium bicarbonate, sodium pyruvate,
N-2 supplement, B27 supplement (Gibco), and 1 mg/mL heparin
(Sigma). For 2D culture, acid-etched glass coverslips were pre-coated
with 0.1 mg/mL polyornithine (Sigma) in water and 0.08 mg/mL
growth factor-reduced Matrigel matrix (Corning) in medium. Alter-
natively, cells were cultured on Matrigel-coated chamber slides con-
taining carbon nanofibers (Sigma, Z694576). For organotypic-like
cultures, spheres were plated on hydrophilic PTFE cell culture in-
serts with 30 mm diameter and 0.4 mm pore size (Millicell). For
sphere cultures, cells were either self-assembled and maintained in
stationary culture or assembled into specific sizes utilizing a micro-
well plate (Stem Cell Technologies, AggreWell-800 24-well plate) fol-
lowed by optional spinning in a bioreactor (Corning Proculture
Spinner Flask on Dlab MS-C-S4 Magnetic Stirrer). All cultures were
maintained in 5% CO2 in 37�C in room oxygen levels.
Sample Processing
Immunoanalysis of spheres consisted of 30 min incubation at 4�C
in 4% paraformaldehyde followed by staining of intact 3D spheres
or sucrose-embedded cryosectioning as 30 mm sections and
attached to slides. Sections were stored at �80�C until immuno-
staining. For immunoanalysis, samples were blocked in 0.25%
Triton X-100 with 5% goat or donkey serum and labeled with
the following antibodies: S100 (Abcam, ab868), GFAP (Chemicon,
MAB360), GFP (Aves, GFP-1020), TUBB3 (Covance, MMS-435P),
GLT1 (a generous gift from Dr. Jeffrey Rothstein), MAP2 (Synaptic
Systems, 188 004), Ezrin (Thermo Fisher, MA5-13862), SYN 1 (Syn-
aptic Systems, 106 103), PSD95 (Abcam, ab2723), and Homer (Syn-
aptic Systems, 160 011). hAstro morphology and synaptic colocal-
ization was measured utilizing ImageJ software. Scanning electron
microscopy was conducted at the Houston Methodist Research
Institute Electron Microscopy Core. mGFP reporter was generated
by infecting cells with lentiviral particles generated with a reporter
construct as described previously (Addgene plasmid no. 22479;
Rompani and Cepko, 2008). For calcium imaging, hAstros were in-
fected with lentivirus generated from Addgene Plasmid no. 72303
(Dempsey et al., 2016).
Statistics
For quantification analysis, statistical tests were performed only
when spheres were independently generated from separate start-
ing hPSC cultures. SEM was calculated using averages of data
from randomly selected fields throughout the spheres. All mea-
surements are presented as means ± SEM. When appropriate,
