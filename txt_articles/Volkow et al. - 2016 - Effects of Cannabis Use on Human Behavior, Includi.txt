t is well established that cannabis use causes acute impair-
ment in the ability of the brain to hold information (ie, cogni-
tivecapacity).Hence,temporarydeficitsoccurinlearningand
memory, attention, and working memory.
Does Cannabis Use Affect Cognitive Capacity?
Cannabis use causes acute impairment of learning and memory, at-
tention, and working memory,1-3 but it is less clear if cannabis use is
associated with enduring neuropsychological impairment. Case-
controlstudiescomparingnonintoxicatedheavycannabisuserswith
nonusershavefairlyconsistentlyshownthatheavycannabisusersper-
formworseonneuropsychologicaltests.Forexample,theresultsfrom
2 separate meta-analyses4,5 showed that compared with nonusers,
nonintoxicatedcannabisusersperformworseonmeasuresofglobal
neuropsychological function, with effect sizes for specific neuropsy-
chological domains (executive functions, attention, learning and
memory, motor skills, and verbal abilities) of approximately one-
third of a standard deviation or less. When analyses in the second
meta-analysis5werelimitedto13studiesofcannabisuserswithatleast
1 month of abstinence, there was no discernible difference between
cannabis users and nonusers on neuropsychological test perfor-
mance,suggestingthatneuropsychologicalfunctionsmightrecover
withprolongedabstinence.Evidencesuggeststhatthemagnitudeof
neuropsychologicalimpairmentandtheextenttowhichitpersistsaf-
terabstinencemaydependonthefrequencyanddurationofcanna-
bis use, length of abstinence, and age at onset of use.6
Emerging evidence suggests that adolescents may be particu-
larly vulnerable to the adverse effects of cannabis use. Adoles-
cence represents a critical neurodevelopmental period character-
ized by marked synaptic pruning and increased myelination.7
Moreover, the endocannabinoid system appears to be involved in
the regulation of key neurodevelopmental processes,7 suggesting
that the introduction of exogenous cannabinoids during adoles-
cencecoulddisruptnormalbraindevelopment.Animalresearchsup-
portsthepossibilitythatadolescencerepresentsaperiodofheight-
enedvulnerabilitytocannabisexposure.7Forexample,pubertalrats

ject recognition tasks, whereas adult rats did not.8,9 Accumulating
evidenceinhumansparallelstheanimalfindings.6Forexample,sev-
eral studies have shown that earlier age at onset of cannabis use is
associated with greater neuropsychological impairment,10,11 and a
2012 population-representative longitudinal study12 documented
thatadolescent-onset(butnotadult-onset)persistentcannabisus-
ers showed neuropsychological decline from ages 13 to 38 years.
Neuroimaging investigations of adolescent and adult cannabis
users have yielded somewhat inconsistent findings. Recent re-
viewshavedemonstratedthatthereisfairlyclearevidenceofstruc-
tural alterations in medial temporal (amygdala and hippocampus),
frontal,andcerebellarregionsassociatedwithcannabisexposure.13,14
However, another recent study15 that carefully matched partici-
pantsonalcoholintakereportednoevidenceofmorphologicalbrain
alteration among adolescent or adult cannabis abusers, suggesting
the possibility that comorbid alcohol use could explain some of the
morphological alterations observed in prior research. There is also
some evidence that cannabis users have impaired neural connec-
tivity. For example, a study16 of adults with long histories of heavy
cannabisuseshowedevidenceofdecreasedconnectivityintheright
fimbria of the hippocampus (fornix) and the splenium of the cor-
pus callosum and the commissural fibers. Finally, functional mag-
neticresonanceimaginginvestigationshavesuggestedthatcanna-
bis users show altered neural activity both in the resting state and
during cognitive testing.14 For example, male adolescent cannabis
With a political debate about the potential risks and benefits of cannabis use as a backdrop,
the wave of legalization and liberalization initiatives continues to spread. Four states
(Colorado, Washington, Oregon, and Alaska) and the District of Columbia have passed laws
that legalized cannabis for recreational use by adults, and 23 others plus the District of
Columbia now regulate cannabis use for medical purposes. These policy changes could
trigger a broad range of unintended consequences, with profound and lasting implications for
the health and social systems in our country. Cannabis use is emerging as one among many
interacting factors that can affect brain development and mental function. To inform the
political discourse with scientific evidence, the literature was reviewed to identify what is
known and not known about the effects of cannabis use on human behavior, including
cognition, motivation, and psychosis.

users showed increased blood oxygen level–dependent functional
magnetic resonance imaging activity in the prefrontal cortex dur-
ing a novel working memory task, which was interpreted to reflect
inefficient processing.17 This observation is consistent with studies
measuringrestingfunctionalconnectivityinadolescentcannabisus-
ers that have documented altered patterns of connectivity affect-
inginterhemispherictraffic18andthefrontotemporalnetwork.19,20
Some evidence suggests that cannabidiol, another cannabinoid
found in the cannabis plant (although usually at very low concen-
trations), may protect against some of the harmful effects of tetra-
hydrocannabinol (THC) on cognition.21,22
Thereareareasthatrequirefurtherresearch.First,observeddif-
ferences in neuropsychological test performance, as well as in brain
structure and function, might reflect individual differences that pre-
cede cannabis use. Progress has been limited by reliance on cross-
sectionalinvestigationscomparingcannabisusersandnonusers.Two
longitudinalstudies12,23withbefore-and-afterneuropsychologicaltest-
inghaveshownevidenceofwithin-individualdeclineinneuropsycho-
logicalfunctionassociatedwithcannabisuse.Thefindingscouldnot
beexplainedbyalcoholandotherdruguse,psychiatricdisorders,low

the number of cannabis users in these cohorts was small, and brain
imagingwasnotperformed.Yet,neuroimagingfindingsraisethepos-
sibilitythatsmallerregionalbrainvolumesamongcannabisuserscould
bepartiallyaccountedforbypreexistingdifferences.Forexample,one

texvolumesincreasedriskforadolescentcannabisuseinitiation,while
astudy25oftwinsandsiblingsfoundthatreducedamygdalavolumes

gether,thesefindingshighlighttheneedforlongitudinalstudiesthat
follow up adolescents from before to after initiation of cannabis use
andcombineneuropsychologicaltestingwithneuroimaging.TheAdo-
lescentBrainCognitiveDevelopmentStudy,26alargeprospectiveNa-
tional Institutes of Health–funded investigation of children ages 9 to
10yearswhowillbefollowedupforatleast10years,isbeinglaunched
to in part meet this need.
A second area that is ripe for further research pertains to the
need to reconcile neuroimaging findings with neuropsychological
test performance. Current neuroimaging evidence is inconsistent,
andalterationsinbrainstructureandfunctiontendnottocorrelate
withdecrementsinneuropsychologicaltestperformance.27Larger
samplesareneededforimagingalongwithcarefulconsiderationof
participant characteristics, including comorbid use of alcohol and
other drugs and length of abstinence from cannabis.
Third,moreworkisneededtoanswerthequestion“Howmuch
cannabis use is too much?”Because many study samples include a
large portion of individuals with cannabis dependence (as defined
by the DSM-IV), it is unclear if the effects generalize to individuals
with less severe cannabis use disorders and to more casual recre-
ational users.
Fourth, because of the potential effect of exogenous cannabi-
noids on brain development, more work is needed to answer the
question “
At what age is cannabis use most harmful?”In addition to
studyingtheeffectsofcannabisuseonadolescents,researchisalso
needed to understand older adults’susceptibility to cannabis-
related neuropsychological impairment. This population experi-
ences changes in brain plasticity and age-related cognitive decline
thatmaymakethemmorevulnerabletotheeffectsofcannabisuse.
Fifth, recent evidence suggests sex differences in neuropsy-
chological deficits associated with cannabis use.1,28 Hence, future
workshouldhelpclarifymechanismsunderlyingthesepotentialsex
differences.
Sixth, genetic factors such as polymorphisms in the COMT
(OMIM 116790) and AKT1 (OMIM 164730) genes may also increase
susceptibilitytocannabis-relatedneuropsychologicalimpairment.29
Other examples include a recent study30 that showed that THC
causedacuteimpairmentofworkingmemoryforCOMTVal/Valcar-
riers(butnotMetcarriers),aswellasanotherstudy31of3population-
based cohorts that showed that cannabis use was associated with
decreasedcorticalthicknessamongmaleindividualsathigh(butnot
low) genetic risk for schizophrenia as indexed by a polygenic risk
score.Thepossibilitythatindividualdifferencesamongcannabisus-
ers may have significant effects and be predictive of the extent of
adverse consequences suggests that recent approaches to lever-
aging genetic information to create polygenic risk scores might be
useful toward advancing the study of cannabis use and neuropsy-
chological function.
Does Cannabis Use Decrease Motivation?
As early as the late 19th century, the Indian Hemp Drugs
Commission32reportedthatheavycannabisusewasassociatedwith
apathy,definedasreducedmotivationforgoal-directedbehavior.33
However, it was only after the marked increase in cannabis use of
the1960sthattheamotivationaleffectsofchroniccannabisusewere
linkedtoimpairmentsinlearningandsustainedattention.Theterm
cannabisamotivationalsyndromewasproposedbyMcGlothlinand
West,34whocharacterizeditasapathyanddiminishedabilitytocon-
centrate,followroutines,orsuccessfullymasternewmaterial.While
there has always been some controversy around the need for de-
fining such a distinct phenotype, there is evidence that long-term
heavy cannabis use is associated with educational underachieve-
mentandimpairedmotivation,whichhavebeenproposedtobepo-
tential mediators of poorer functional outcomes.35
There is both preclinical and clinical evidence supporting the
view that cannabis use is associated with an amotivational state. In
rhesus monkeys, heavy chronic cannabis use or administration has
been found to dampen motivation, as measured on progressive ra-
tioandconditionedpositionrespondingoperanttests.36Thereispre-
liminarylaboratoryevidencesupportinganassociationbetweenre-
duced motivation for reward-related behavior in cannabis users
compared with control individuals.37 Because these findings ap-
peartoberelatedtorepeateddosesofTHC,itislikelythatreduced
motivation is one pathway to impaired learning, as THC can disrupt
reward-based learning.38 In support of this theory, cannabis users
exhibit reduced striatal dopamine synthesis capacity,39 with an in-
verse relationship to amotivation. Inasmuch as dopamine signaling
sustains motivation,40 impaired dopamine synthesis could under-
lie the amotivational state in cannabis users. Similarly, imaging in-
vestigationsdocumenteddecreasedreactivitytodopaminestimu-
lation in cannabis users that was associated with negative
emotionality and that would also contribute to reduce engage-

Indeed,addictiontothedrugoccursinabout9%ofusers42whoap-
pear more vulnerable than other users because of a multiplicity of
variables,includingageatonset,levelofuse,andenvironmentaland
genetic factors.
What remains to be seen is whether changes in the concentra-
tionoftheactiveingredientsofcannabiscouldaffecttheriskofamo-
tivationoraddiction.Thecannabisplantcontainsapproximately100
uniquecannabinoidingredients,withthemostresearchedbeingTHC
and cannabidiol. Over the last 30 years, levels of THC in street can-
nabis have increased.43 Of these 2 compounds, only THC deter-
mines the level of the subjective high. Alongside a blunted dopa-
mine system,41 chronic heavy use of cannabis is associated with
changes in the endocannabinoid system, including reduced levels
of anandamide (an endogenous ligand for the cannabinoid recep-
tors) in human cerebrospinal fluid44 and reduced levels of canna-
binoid 1 receptors.45 Indeed, a growing preclinical literature impli-
cates cannabinoid 1 receptors and their endogenous ligands in the
motivational effects of cannabis use.46 Similar to the association of
cannabis use with cognitive impairment, it is impossible to unam-
biguously establish whether cannabis use is a cause, consequence,
orcorrelateofalteredmotivation.Furtherworkisneededtodistin-
guishwhetherthepotentialamotivationaleffectsarerelatedtocan-
nabis use disorders rather than cannabis use per se.
Does Cannabis Use Increase the Risk for Psychosis?
Oneofthemostpersistentcontroversiesvis-à-viscannabisuseper-
tainstoitseffectontheriskofpsychiatricdisorders,particularlypsy-
chotic disorders and full-blown schizophrenia. Longitudinal inves-
tigationsshowaconsistentassociationbetweenadolescentcannabis
useandpsychosis.Cannabisuseisconsideredapreventableriskfac-
tor for psychosis.47 The link between cannabis use and schizophre-
nia could stem from direct causality, gene-environment interac-
tions,sharedetiology,orself-medicationforpremorbidsymptoms,
although some researchers have suggested that only the first 3 hy-
potheses remain open questions.48-50 The sporadic emergence of
conflictingdatashouldnotbesurprisinggiventhenatureofthispar-
ticular biological problem. For example, the effects of cannabis ex-
posuremaybemodestinthetotalpopulationandcontingentonthe

otherhand,thereremainsalingeringandlegitimatecontroversyover
whatproportionofpsychosisriskcanbeattributedtocannabisuse
and the extent to which individuals without genetic predisposition
can be precipitated into the illness.
Despitethisambiguity,thereisstrongphysiologicalandepide-
miological evidence supporting a mechanistic link between canna-
bisuseandschizophrenia.Tetrahydrocannabinol(particularlyathigh
doses) can cause acute, transient, dose-dependent psychosis
(schizophrenia-like positive and negative symptoms).51 In addi-
tion, prospective, longitudinal, epidemiological studies consis-
tentlyreportanassociationbetweencannabisuseandschizophre-
nia in which cannabis use precedes psychosis52 independent of
alcohol consumption53 and even after removing52,54 or controlling
for55,56 those individuals who had used other drugs. Although the
prodromal period before full-blown illness complicates determin-
ing whether or not cannabis use precedes symptoms or reflects an
attempt to treat them, cannabis use preceded psychosis in these
studies.52,54,57 Moreover, persistent cannabis use after a first epi-
sodeisassociatedwithpoorerprognosis58evenaftercontrollingfor
other substance use.59
Although cannabis use may have long been discontinued be-
fore the onset of psychosis, the age at which cannabis use begins
appears to correlate with the age at onset of psychosis, suggesting
a causal relationship to initiating psychosis that is independent of
actualuse.49,60,61Theassociationbetweencannabisuseandchronic
psychosis (including a schizophrenia diagnosis) is stronger in those
individuals who have had heavy or frequent cannabis use during
adolescence,53,54,60,62,63 earlier use,52 or use of cannabis with high
THC potency.60,62 From these studies, ever use of cannabis is esti-
matedtoincreasetheriskofschizophreniabyapproximately2-fold,
accountingfor8%to14%ofcases,55withfrequentuseoruseofcan-
nabis with high THC potency increasing the risk of schizophrenia
6-fold.53 Consistent with this notion, the greater cannabinoid re-
ceptortype1availabilitythathasbeenreportedinsomepatientswith
schizophrenia,64,65andwhichcorrelateswithnegativesymptoms,66
may also contribute to an enhanced sensitivity to the psychoto-
geniceffectsofcannabisuse.Itisimportanttohighlightinthiscon-
textthatmostindividualswhousecannabisdonotdevelopschizo-

sufficient for the development of schizophrenia, available evi-
dence suggests that cannabis use may initiate the emergence of a
lastingpsychoticillnessinsomepersons(mostlikelythoseindividu-
als with a genetic vulnerability),67 and this finding warrants serious
consideration from the point of view of public health policy.
It is becoming increasingly clear that acute psychosis, schizo-
phreniform disorder, and schizophrenia are the result of interac-
tions among many different factors operating at various levels. For
example, having a close family member with schizophrenia is the
strongest known risk factor for schizophrenia, yet few investiga-
tions linking cannabis use and schizophrenia have controlled spe-
cificallyforfamilialschizophreniarisk.Theresultsofonestudy68sug-
gested that cannabis use may lead to schizophrenia in individuals
with a family history of the disease compared with those individu-
als without a family history. However, controlling for familial risk in
one large epidemiological study69 considerably attenuated but did

phrenia, with odds ratios of 3.3 and 1.6 with 3-year and 7-year tem-
poral delays, respectively.
Possible3-wayinteractionsamonggenotype,cannabisuse,and
psychosis have also been explored. The DRD2 genotype (OMIM
126450) influenced the likelihood of a psychotic disorder in indi-
vidualswhousedcannabis.70Amongoccasionalcannabisusersand
daily cannabis users, carriers of the DRD2, rs1076560, T allele had
3-fold and 5-fold higher likelihoods of a psychotic disorder,
respectively.70ThefunctionalCOMTVal-158polymorphismhasalso

Conclusions
Decades of ill-informed and porous legal and illegal drug regula-
tions have exacted a devastating public health toll from our soci-
ety. It is clear that the cumulative effect of nicotine exposure and
alcohol use on morbidity and mortality has been staggering, as has
thedisproportionatecriminaljusticeinfluenceofthe“warondrugs”
onminorityanddisadvantagedpopulations.Currenteffortstonor-
malize cannabis use are being driven largely by a combination of
grassroots activism, pharmacological ingenuity, and private profi-
teering, with a worrisome disregard for scientific evidence, gaps in
ourknowledge,orthepossibilityofunintendedconsequences.Given

rationofuse,andpotencyofcannabisused)conferthegreatestrisk
for the development of cannabis use disorder or for other adverse
consequences (ie, cognitive deficits, lack of motivation, or psycho-
sis). In addition, there are many unanswered questions more di-
rectly linked to the soundness of hastily implemented policies. For
example, will advertising be permitted? What patterns of use and
associated toxic effects will emerge if and when “
e-joints”become
widespreadoreventhenormamongadolescents?Howwillexpand-
ing the pool of pregnant cannabis users affect the developmental
trajectories of exposed fetuses? Finally, what are the conse-
quences of secondhand cannabis smoke?
If we stay the current course, we are likely to uncover effects
that were rare in the past only because the use was not as wide-
spread as that of legal drugs. Vulnerable populations such as chil-
dren,adolescents,theelderly,orindividualswithotherdisordersmay

the multiple effects of cannabis use on the brain and body, belie the
