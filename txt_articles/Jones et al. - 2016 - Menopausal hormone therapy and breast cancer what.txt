Background: Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) increases breast cancer risk; however, most cohort studies omit MHT use after
enrolment and many infer menopausal age.
Methods: We used information from serial questionnaires from the UK Generations Study cohort to estimate hazard ratios (HRs)
for breast cancer among post-menopausal women with known menopausal age, and examined biases induced when not updating
data on MHT use and including women with inferred menopausal age.
Results: Among women recruited in 2003–2009, at 6 years of follow-up, 58 148 had reached menopause and 96% had completed a
follow-up questionnaire. Among 39 183 women with known menopausal age, 775 developed breast cancer, and the HR in relation
to current oestrogen plus progestogen MHT use (based on 52 current oestrogen plus progestogen MHT users in breast cancer
cases) relative to those with no previous MHT use was 2.74 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.05–3.65) for a median duration of 5.4
years of current use, reaching 3.27 (95% CI: 1.53–6.99) at 15 þ years of use. The excess HR was underestimated by 53% if oestrogen
plus progestogen MHT use was not updated after recruitment, 13% if women with uncertain menopausal age were included, and
59% if both applied. The HR for oestrogen-only MHT was not increased (HR ¼ 1.00; 95% CI: 0.66–1.54).
Conclusions: Lack of updating MHT status through follow-up and inclusion of women with inferred menopausal age is likely to
result in substantial underestimation of the excess relative risks for oestrogen plus progestogen MHT use in studies with long
follow-up, limited updating of exposures, and changing or short durations of use.
Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) provides effective relief
from climacteric symptoms but some are associated with increased
risk of stroke, venous thromboembolism, and breast, ovarian, and
endometrial
cancers
(Medicines
and
Healthcare
Products
Regulatory Agency UK, 2007; Santen et al, 2010). The MHT
prescribing decreased rapidly (Ameye et al, 2014) after its adverse
effects on risk of breast cancer were highlighted in reports from the
Women’s Health Initiative trial (Rossouw et al, 2002) and the
Million
Women
Study
(Beral
and
Million
Women
Study
Collaborators, 2003), but nevertheless it continues to be used by
many women worldwide (Chlebowski and Anderson, 2012;
Antoine et al, 2016).

 Accurate information about the risks (and benefits) of MHT is
essential to allow women to make informed decisions about their
health, and evidence from observational studies is important
because it is no longer justifiable to conduct long-term trials of
MHT safety (Vickers et al, 2007). There are, however, shortfalls in
the way information has been collected and analysed in most
published epidemiological studies (Colditz et al, 1995; Magnusson
et al, 1999; Li et al, 2000; Schairer et al, 2000; Daling et al, 2002;

Fournier
et

2014;
Thorbjarnardottir et al, 2014; Roman et al, 2016). In prospective
studies that only collect information on MHT up to the time of
recruitment (e.g., cohort studies with no follow-up questionnaires)
current use of MHT and duration of use may be misclassified
because some never users of MHT will become users during
follow-up, and some users will become ex-users; this may lead to
biased assessment of breast cancer risk in relation to MHT use
(Van Leeuwen and Rookus, 2003; Lee et al, 2005) but the extent
has not been assessed empirically. In addition, analyses that
include women who have had simple hysterectomy (i.e., without
oophorectomy) before natural menopause will also lead to biased
results (Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast
Cancer, 1997; Pike et al, 1998; Rockhill et al, 2000; Simpson et al,
2007) but many case–control and cohort studies include such
women (Colditz et al, 1995; Magnusson et al, 1999; Li et al, 2000;
Schairer et al, 2000; Daling et al, 2002; Newcomb et al, 2002; Beral
and Million Women Study Collaborators, 2003; Li et al, 2003;
Bakken et al, 2004, 2011; Chen et al, 2004, 2006; Stahlberg et al,
2004; Fournier et al, 2005; Brinton et al, 2008; Saxena et al, 2010;
Beral et al, 2011; Calvocoressi et al, 2012; Ritte et al, 2012; Cordina-
Duverger et al, 2013; Fournier et al, 2014; Thorbjarnardottir et al,
2014; Roman et al, 2016). Thus, although the epidemiological
evidence clearly shows an increased risk of breast cancer with
MHT use (Campagnoli et al, 2005; Greiser et al, 2005; Lee et al,
2005), there is uncertainty about the magnitude of the risk.
To address these issues we used serial questionnaire information
from the Breakthrough Generations Study (BGS), which has
ascertained MHT use and menopausal status at entry and during
prospective follow-up, to estimate the relative risk of breast cancer
in relation to MHT use among women whose age at menopause
was known. We also assessed the likely extent of the biases that
occur when only baseline questionnaire information is available
and if women with simple hysterectomy are included in analyses.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The BGS is a cohort study of 113 693 women from the United
Kingdom, aged X16 years, from whom questionnaire information
and informed consent was gained at recruitment during 2003–
2015. The first follow-up questionnaire was completed at 2.5 years
after recruitment, a second at B6 years, and a third at 9.5 years.
The study was approved by the South East Multi-Centre Research
Ethics Committee.
Breast and other cancers occurring in the cohort were identified
from recruitment and follow-up questionnaires and spontaneous
reports to the study centre. Confirmation of diagnosis was obtained
from the cancer registries in the United Kingdom, ‘flagging’ at the
National Health Service Central Registers (virtually complete
registers of the populations of England and Wales, and of Scotland,
to which study participants can be linked and on which deaths and
cancer registrations are ‘flagged’ and then periodically reported to
authorised medical researchers), pathology reports, and corre-
spondence with patients’ general practitioners.
Information on MHT was obtained at recruitment and from the
second follow-up questionnaire, and was used to assess MHT
exposure from menopause to date of breast cancer incidence or
end of follow-up. Women were asked the ages or years they started
and stopped episodes of MHT use, whether they were still using
MHT, and the name of each drug used. We also asked participants
at recruitment and in the second follow-up questionnaire how old
they were when their periods stopped completely (i.e., they had
gone 6 months without having had a period). Women who could
not report age at natural menopause, because of hysterectomy
without bilateral oophorectomy or because they were taking MHT
or oral contraceptives around the time of menopause (i.e., at least 6
months without having a period and not being pregnant), were
excluded from the main analyses because it was not possible to
determine the age at which their ovarian function ceased.
Information was also collected on other breast cancer risk factors
(Swerdlow et al, 2011).
Statistical analysis. The current analytic cohort is based on all
women who were recruited to the study during June 2003 to
December 2009 inclusive without previous breast cancer. The
recruitment cutoff at December 2009 was selected because at the
time of analysis the follow-up for the second questionnaire was
practically complete for this group of recruits. Women with known
age at menopause entered risk at their date of recruitment or
menopause, whichever was later, and were censored at the earliest
date of: first invasive or in situ breast cancer, death, follow-up
questionnaire, or loss to study follow-up. Left-truncated and right-
censored Cox proportional hazards regression (Cox, 1972) using
attained age as the implicit timescale was used to estimate hazard
ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for MHT use and
risk of first invasive or in situ breast cancer, adjusted for
(continuous) menopausal age.
The MHT was analysed as a time-varying exposure lagged by 1
year (Schairer et al, 2000; Fournier et al, 2005). The effect of the lag
was to make the year following start of treatment a nonexposed
period (as the exposure within the early months of use is unlikely
to be the cause of breast cancers occurring in that period), and the
year after cessation to be considered a part of the period of
exposure; this avoided a potential ‘reverse causation’ bias, as MHT
may be stopped during work-up to a formal breast cancer
diagnosis. Follow-up time for each woman was divided into the
period(s), after onset of menopause, that were: before MHT use,
current MHT use, and after cessation of MHT use. A woman could
move from being a user to ex-user to user again if there was a gap
of at least 1 year between periods of MHT use (reports of MHT
ending and re-starting within 1 year were treated as contiguous
periods of use). In sensitivity analyses exploring the effect of not
updating MHT use beyond baseline we assumed a duration of use
as recorded at baseline and did not extrapolate the duration of use
beyond that reported at baseline.
Drug preparation was assigned based on the type of MHT used
longest during each contiguous episode of use. Tests for trend in
duration of current use were calculated over periods of 0–o1, 1–
o2,... years, scored as 0.5, 1.5,..., and included an indicator variable
for current user vs never user (i.e., never users were not treated as
users with zero duration but as a separate category to allow for
systematic differences between those who are prescribed MHT and
those who are not). Heterogeneity in HRs for subtypes of breast
cancer by behaviour, oestrogen receptor status, and morphology
was assessed using a data augmentation method (Lunn and
McNeil, 1995). To assess potential confounding in addition to that
due to age at menopause (as a continuous variable) we also
adjusted for: birth cohort, benign breast disease, family history of
breast cancer in first-degree relatives, socioeconomic score, age at

(or if unavailable, from second follow-up questionnaire). We
included any breast cancers diagnosed after recruitment (i.e., no
minimum interval) but adjusted for, and tested for heterogeneity
in, time since recruitment to BGS cohort (o1 year; 1 þ year). We
carried out additional analyses including women with uncertain
menopausal age by including follow-up from these women only
from age 58 years (the age by which 99% of women with known
menopausal age were post-menopausal) but, to allow adjustment
for menopausal age and estimation of duration of MHT use since
menopause, we assumed menopause occurred at age 50 years (and
only considered MHT use if it was used from this age). All
statistical tests were two sided and analyses were conducted using
Stata/IC version 14.0 (StataCorp, 2015).
RESULTS
During 2003–2009, a recruitment questionnaire was completed by
104 164 women who joined the BGS without prior breast cancer
(or mastectomy), of whom 58 148 were established as post-
menopausal before the censoring date for analysis. The first follow-
up questionnaire at 2.5 years after recruitment was completed by
57 592 of these women (99.0%) and the second follow-up
questionnaire at B6 years after recruitment was completed by
55 923 (96.2%) of these post-menopausal women (3.7% completed
an abridged version by telephone). Of the remainder at second
follow-up, 1.2% had died by this time, 1.7% were alive but had not
completed the questionnaire although their vital and cancer status
was available from ‘flagging’ at the National Health Service Central
Registers, and 0.9% were lost to follow-up at an earlier date (e.g.,
emigrations) or no follow-up was available. The follow-up rate
(calculated as the total observed person-years divided by the
person-years that would have been achievable if all post-
menopausal women were followed-up to their second question-
naire or, if earlier, death) was 99.5%.
Menopausal age was known for 39 183 women and was
uncertain (i.e., by hysterectomy, MHT, or oral contraceptive use)
for 18 965 women. Of those with known menopausal age, 88.9%
reported a natural menopause and 9.4% reported bilateral
oophorectomy as the reason for menopause; the remaining 1.7%
reported various other procedures or treatments. The median
interval between menopause and subsequent recruitment for the
30 113 women known to be post-menopausal at recruitment was 7
years (interquartile range: 3 to 13 years). There were 9070 women
pre-menopausal at recruitment who subsequently became post-
menopausal during follow-up and at that point became eligible for
analysis (median interval between recruitment and incident
menopause for these 9070 women: 4 years; interquartile range: 2
to 5 years). The following results, unless otherwise stated, are based
on the women with known menopausal age. The mean menopausal
age was 50.2 (s.d.: 4.6) years and mean post-menopausal BMI was
25.7 (s.d.: 4.5) kg m � 2. Table 1 presents further descriptive
characteristics of the cohort and the pattern of MHT use at
recruitment: 5.0% of women who had not used MHT by
recruitment subsequently used MHT sometime during follow-up
and 65.4% of current users at recruitment ceased use by end of
follow-up. At recruitment the median duration of use of oestrogen-
only MHT was 6.5 years (interquartile range: 2.5 to 10.5 years), of
oestrogen plus progestogen MHT was 5.5 years (interquartile
range: 2.5 to 9.5 years), and was 4.5.years (interquartile range: 1.5
to 8.5 years) for other types of MHT. Supplementary Table 1
describes the 775 first incident invasive or in situ breast cancers
that were diagnosed during 204 390 person-years (median 6.0
years) of follow-up among 39 183 women with known age at
menopause (and similar descriptive statistics for 18 965 women
with unknown age at menopause).
The HR for invasive and in situ breast cancer adjusted for
menopausal and attained age was 1.95 (95% CI: 1.55–2.46;
Po0.001) for current users of all types of MHT relative to never
users (Table 2). The HR increased with duration of current use by

2.02 (95% CI: 1.12–3.66; P ¼ 0.020). There was little difference in
HR and trend after adjusting for further potential confounding
variables (results shown in Supplementary Table 2; distribution of
adjustment variables in Supplementary Tables 3 and 4), and hence
the following results adjust only for menopausal and attained age.
Risk was not significantly increased for past MHT use overall or by
type of MHT preparation (Table 2), or oestrogen receptor status
(Table 3), or morphological type (Supplementary Table 5), nor did
the HR in past users differ by duration of past use (o5 years vs
5 þ years: Pheterogeneity ¼ 0.093).
Analysed by type of MHT preparation (Table 2), for oestrogen-
only preparations (median duration of current use 6.6 years) breast
cancer risk was not significantly increased with current use
(HR ¼ 1.00; 95% CI: 0.66–1.54; P ¼ 0.99) and there was a
nonsignificant increase in HR per year of use (4.2% per year of
use; 95% CI: � 1.8 to 10.5%; P ¼ 0.17). For combined oestrogen
plus progestogen preparations (median duration of current use 5.4

 1.53–6.99; P ¼ 0.002) at 15 þ years of use. As can be seen by the
non-overlapping CIs, there was a significant difference between the
HRs for breast cancer risk in relation to current oestrogen-only
MHT use vs never use compared with current oestrogen plus
progestogen use vs never use (Pheterogeneityo0.001). There was no
heterogeneity by time since recruitment for risk of breast cancer in
relation to oestrogen-only MHT use (Pheterogeneity ¼ 0.35) or
combined MHT use (Pheterogeneity ¼ 0.72). Without adjustment
for menopausal age, the HR for breast cancer and combined
oestrogen plus progestogen MHT use was 2.64 (95% CI: 1.98–3.52;
Po0.001).
The HR for combined oestrogen plus progestogen preparations
was 2.96 (95% CI: 2.19–3.99; Po0.001) for invasive and 1.46 (95%
CI: 0.53–4.00; P ¼ 0.47) for in situ breast cancer, but the difference
between these was not significant (Pheterogeneity ¼ 0.18) and in situ
breast cancer only accounted for 14% of cases (Supplementary
Table 6 presents results for invasive breast cancer only). The HRs
for combined MHT for ductal (HR ¼ 2.60; 95% CI: 1.86–3.64;
Po0.001) and lobular (HR ¼ 3.12; 95% CI: 1.50–6.51; P ¼ 0.002)
breast cancers were both increased but not significantly different to
each other (Pheterogeneity ¼ 0.60; Supplementary Table 5). The HR
for oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer was 2.89 (95% CI:
2.09–4.00; Po0.001) and was not significantly different to that for
oestrogen receptor-negative breast cancer (Pheterogeneity ¼ 0.31;
Table 3).
When analysed by type of combined oestrogen plus progestogen
MHT, the HR for breast cancer for serial combined preparations
(HR ¼ 2.95; 95% CI: 1.92–4.53; Po0.001) was not significantly
different
from
that
for
continuous
combined
preparations
(HR ¼ 2.67; 95% CI: 1.82–3.95; Po0.001) (Pheterogeneity ¼ 0.74).
For other or unspecified types of MHT, of which tibolone use made
up 49%, risk compared with never users was significantly increased
with current use (Po0.001), but there was no significant trend
with duration of use (P ¼ 0.78). The HR for breast cancer for
current tibolone use was 2.32 (95% CI: 1.03–5.20; P ¼ 0.041).
Among women with no family history of breast cancer, the HR for
current tibolone use was 1.60 (95% CI: 0.51–4.99; P ¼ 0.42) but this
was based on only three cases of breast cancer, and among those
with a positive family history of breast cancer the HR was 4.15
(95% CI: 1.32–13.1; P ¼ 0.015), but again was based on only three
cases of breast cancer, and the difference between the HRs was not
significant (P ¼ 0.25).
The above analyses update data on MHT use after recruitment
using serial questionnaire information and exclude women with
uncertain menopausal age (e.g., because of hysterectomy). We next
examined the potential biases when these analytic procedures were
not done (Table 4). The number of women available for analysis
was reduced when using baseline information only because women
who become post-menopausal after recruitment were not con-
sidered eligible, and the number of women available increased
when those with uncertain menopausal age were included,
although their follow-up for risk of breast cancer only started at
age 58 years (only 13 404 women with uncertain menopausal age
reached
this
age
during
follow-up;
descriptive
statistics
in
Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). The excess HR for breast cancer
for combined MHT use was 53% smaller when usage during
follow-up was ignored, 13% smaller when women with uncertain
menopausal age were included in analyses, and 59% smaller for
both these analytic approaches combined. If restricted to invasive
breast cancer only, the biases were 46%, 15%, and 56% respectively.
Table 4 also shows results by duration of use; at each duration
there was B50% bias when usage during follow-up was ignored.
The interrelation between MHT, BMI, and risk of breast cancer
is shown in Table 5. Risk of breast cancer increased significantly
(Po0.001) with greater BMI among women not using MHT and
among past users (P ¼ 0.030). The risk of breast cancer was
increased with current use of combined oestrogen plus progestogen
MHT within each category of BMI but there was no significant
trend with BMI (P ¼ 0.39). The relative increase in risk for
combined oestrogen plus progestogen MHT was smaller with
greater BMI, for example, for BMI at þ 30kg m � 2, the HR was
(3.40/1.64 ¼ ) 2.07 (95% CI: 0.84–5.10; P ¼ 0.11), BMI at 25 to

DISCUSSION
In our cohort, the risk of post-menopausal breast cancer was
increased with current use of MHT, as in previous studies (Colditz
et al, 1995; Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast
Cancer, 1997; Stahlberg et al, 2004; Campagnoli et al, 2005; Santen
et al, 2010; Bakken et al, 2011; Beral et al, 2011; Salagame et al,
2011; Anderson et al, 2012; Chlebowski and Anderson, 2012), and
the increase in risk was larger with combined oestrogen plus
progestogen than with oestrogen-only formulations, again as seen
before (Colditz et al, 1995; Olsson et al, 2003; Stahlberg et al, 2004;
Campagnoli et al, 2005; Bakken et al, 2011; Beral et al, 2011;
Chlebowski and Anderson, 2012; Roman et al, 2016). In particular,
our relative risk estimates for current use of combined MHT are
compatible with the results from epidemiological studies that have
updated MHT use by questionnaire (Chen et al, 2004; Calle et al,
2009; Beral et al, 2011; Fournier et al, 2014) or record linkage
(Roman et al, 2016). Relative risk increased with greater duration
of current combined MHT use, to 3.27 at 15 þ years of use, and
these long-term risks were larger than those previously reported
(Li et al, 2003; Brinton et al, 2008; Saxena et al, 2010), although
there is considerable overlap in the CIs around these estimates.
We also found the association between risk of breast cancer and
combined MHT use was compatible with previous publications
that have shown attenuation of MHT-associated breast cancer risks
in women with high BMI relative to non-users of MHT with
similar BMI (Beral et al, 2011; Ritte et al, 2012); consequently, care
is needed when comparing results between studies if they differ in
BMI profile. Our results, however, should be comparable with
other large epidemiological studies in this respect as the average
post-menopausal BMI of women in our study (25.7 kg m � 2) was
similar to that in the Million Women Study (26.2 kg m � 2; Beral
et al, 2011), the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer
and Nutrition (24.8 kg m � 2; Ritte et al, 2012), and the Nurses’
Health Study (24.9 kg m � 2; Kotsopoulos et al, 2010), although
notably lower than in the Women’s Health Initiative trial
(28.5 kg m � 2; Rossouw et al, 2002). However, our results for
women with BMI 25–o30 kg m � 2 (HR ¼ 2.56; 95% CI: 1.53–4.27)
can be compared with the Women’s Health Initiative trial and
observational study results for women who began combined MHT
use within 5 years of menopause (HR ¼ 1.64; 95% CI: 1.00–2.68)
(Prentice et al, 2008); our HR is larger but the CIs from both
studies overlap.
We included invasive and in situ breast cancer as the analysis
end point, similar to the Million Women Study (Beral et al, 2011),
although when we re-analysed using only invasive breast cancer as
the end point we saw modestly larger relative risks, but this did not
materially change our conclusions (for direct comparability with
studies that only include invasive breast cancer these results are
available in Supplementary Table 6).
Previous studies have found greater risks for oestrogen receptor-
positive than -negative breast cancer (Li et al, 2003; Chen et al,
2004; Fournier et al, 2008), and we also saw the same for combined
MHT use, although the difference in risks in our study was not
statistically significant perhaps because there were few current
users of MHT who developed oestrogen receptor-negative breast
cancer, and with 775 cases of breast cancer and only 52 cases
currently using combined MHT the study lacked power to detect
such statistical interactions. Our information on oestrogen receptor
status also has some limitations because it came from cancer
registration reports and the cutoffs used to define positive/negative
were not standardised beyond that used in routine practice. We did
not find overall increased risks stronger with combined continuous
regimens than sequential ones, consistent with studies from the
United Kingdom and the United States (Beral and Million Women
Study Collaborators, 2003; Li et al, 2003; Campagnoli et al, 2005;
Brinton et al, 2008; Opatrny et al, 2008), although studies from
northern Europe have tended to show higher rates for continuous
relative to sequential regimens (Olsson et al, 2003; Stahlberg et al,
2004; Campagnoli et al, 2005; Bakken et al, 2011; Roman et al,
2016) and the disparity may be because of differences in
progestogen monthly dose (Bakken et al, 2004; Stahlberg et al,
2004; Campagnoli et al, 2005; Roman et al, 2016). The most
frequently used serial regimens in our study were Prempak-C
(conjugated oestrogen, 625 mg and 1.25 mg; norgestrel, 150 mg),
Elleste Duet (estradiol, 1 and 2 mg; norethisterone, 1 mg), and
Climagest (Estradiol, 2 mg; norethisterone, 1 mg), and the most
frequently used continuous regimens were Premique (conjugated
oestrogen, 625 mg; medroxyprogesterone acetate, 5 mg), Kilovance
(estradiol, 1 mg; norethisterone, 500 mg), and Kilofem (estradiol,
2 mg; norethisterone, 1 mg).

 We found significantly increased risk with other or unspecified
types of MHT. There was, however, no significant trend with
duration of use in this group, perhaps because the increased risk
may be a characteristic of women who take these other types of
preparation rather than an effect of the preparation itself. The most
common type of MHT in this group was tibolone, a selective tissue
oestrogenic activity regulator, and evidence suggests that in the
United Kingdom it is preferentially prescribed to women at
increased risk of breast cancer (Velthuis-Te Wierik et al, 2007).
Our MHT exposure information was gained at recruitment and
from follow-up questionnaire 6 years later. As 96% of women
completed this follow-up it seems unlikely that misclassification of
exposure in the remaining 4% would have materially influenced
our results. Some of our MHT usage was collected after diagnosis
of breast cancer and this has potential to introduce recall bias. If
women with breast cancer were more motivated to recall past
exposures we may expect to have seen increased risks for
oestrogen-only MHT and combined MHT separately but the HR
for oestrogen-only MHT use was not increased. However, given the
attention that the combined MHT has received in the lay press,
women with breast cancer may preferentially recall combined
MHT use. However, we note that only 10 out of the 52 women
diagnosed with breast cancer, and who were current users of
combined MHT, first started MHT use after recruitment to the
study and the other 42 reported current use at recruitment, before
their breast cancer diagnosis. It therefore seems unlikely that our
results are appreciably affected by recall bias. Follow-up for vital
and breast cancer status was obtained for 99% of participants
and confirmation of reported breast cancers for 98%, and hence
there was little scope for biases from unascertained mortality or
exits, or erroneous reporting of breast cancer. A large proportion
of women were excluded from our main analysis because their
age at menopause was uncertain or unknown, usually because
they started MHT or had hysterectomy without oophorectomy,
before cessation of menstrual bleeding. A benefit gained by their
exclusion is that our analysis was not diluted by the inclusion of
possibly misclassified pre-menopausal women. Furthermore, the
exclusion of women with unknown age at menopause does
not produce biased results in prospective studies because
these women could legitimately not have been recruited to a
cohort if they were deemed ineligible by protocol; however,
as a consequence our results may be less generalisable to all
post-menopausal women. This lack of generalisability also
affects other studies that have considered it inappropriate to
include these women in their main analyses of MHT and breast
cancer risk (Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in
Breast Cancer, 1997; Pike et al, 1998; Ross et al, 2000;
Rosenberg et al, 2006).
There are potential biases in cohort studies that only collect
information on history of MHT use up to the time of recruitment
(e.g., with no follow-up exposure data) that can seriously
misclassify actual use (Van Leeuwen and Rookus, 2003; Lee et al,
2005). Magnitude of effect in randomised controlled trials may also
suffer from bias because of misclassification of exposure if
adherence to treatment is not complete. For example, in the
Women’s Health Initiative trial of combined MHT, 42% of women
in the active treatment arm discontinued MHT, and 10.7% of
women in the placebo arm started MHT, at some point during the
active intervention (Rossouw et al, 2002).
By using information from follow-up questionnaires we were
able to update MHT status and duration right up to the breast
cancer
diagnosis
or
censoring
date,
and
hence
avoid
the
misclassification that would occur if only baseline questionnaire
information was available. Without such follow-up information
(i.e., as in many published cohorts (Beral and Million Women
Study Collaborators, 2003; Bakken et al, 2004, 2011; Stahlberg et al,
2004; Brinton et al, 2008; Saxena et al, 2010; Nyante et al, 2013))
we found that the excess breast cancer risk for combined MHT
would be underestimated by B53%. The Women’s Health
Initiative randomised clinical trial saw a similar degree of
underestimation in risk of breast cancer for oestrogen plus
progestogen treatment relative to placebo when comparing an
analysis making allowance for nonadherence to MHT with an
intention-to-treat analysis (49% increased risk of breast cancer vs a
24% increased risk; i.e., 51% reduction in excess relative risk)
(Chlebowski and Anderson, 2012).
Biases may also occur if analyses included women with simple
hysterectomy before menopause (i.e., without oophorectomy) or
who
started
MHT
before
cessation
of
menstrual
bleeding
(Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast Cancer,
1997; Pike et al, 1998; Rockhill et al, 2000; Simpson et al, 2007), as
most published cohort and case–control studies have done (Colditz
et al, 1995; Magnusson et al, 1999; Li et al, 2000; Schairer et al,
2000; Daling et al, 2002; Newcomb et al, 2002; Beral and Million
Women Study Collaborators, 2003; Li et al, 2003; Bakken et al,
2004, 2011; Chen et al, 2004, 2006; Stahlberg et al, 2004; Fournier
et al, 2005; Brinton et al, 2008; Saxena et al, 2010; Beral et al, 2011;
Calvocoressi et al, 2012; Ritte et al, 2012; Cordina-Duverger et al,
2013; Fournier et al, 2014; Thorbjarnardottir et al, 2014; Roman
et al, 2016). We found that the consequent underestimation of the
excess HR for combined MHT use, because of not adjusting
adequately for menopausal age, was B13%. However, women with
simple hysterectomy, or those who started MHT before cessation
of menstrual bleeding, may be different to women with known
age at menopause, and this could be responsible for some or all of
the bias.
For the combination of both the above types of bias we found
that excess breast cancer risks would be underestimated by 59%.
However, the uncertainty around this estimate is large (we estimate
35–83%), and furthermore study-specific characteristics (e.g., when
study was conducted, duration of follow-up, etc.) are also likely to
affect the size of bias that might be seen in other studies. The
misclassification of current use of MHT may be less important in
older studies conducted before results were published from the
Women’s Health Initiative trial (Rossouw et al, 2002) and Million
Women Study (Beral and Million Women Study Collaborators,
2003) as following these reports women stopped using MHT in
large numbers (Chlebowski and Anderson, 2012; Ameye et al,
2014). However, current advice suggests women should use MHT
for the shortest possible time (Stuenkel et al, 2015), and thus
observational studies conducted post 2002/2003 should be cautious
about assuming MHT use at baseline will continue for the duration
of the study.
A number of cohort studies have reported relative risks for
breast cancer of B2.0 to 2.5 for X10 years of combined MHT use
(Beral and Million Women Study Collaborators, 2003; Brinton
et al, 2008; Santen et al, 2010; Saxena et al, 2010; Bakken et al,
2011), but this is presumably an underestimate because all of these
studies did not update MHT use through follow-up and included
in analyses women with uncertain menopausal age. If correction is
made for the bias this induces, we estimate the relative risk would
be in the range 2.7 to 3.5, similar to the 3.5 we observed for 10 þ
years of use. However, at shorter durations of use too we saw
appreciable bias and underestimation of the relative risk for
combined MHT use.
In conclusion, our results show that risk of breast cancer
increases with duration of use of combined MHT up to X15 years,
and relative risks in most of the published literature are likely to be
substantially underestimated because of lack of updating MHT
status through follow-up in cohort studies and inclusion of women
with inferred menopausal age in cohort or case–control analyses.
These results provide further information to allow women to make
informed decisions about the potential risks and benefits of
MHT use.
