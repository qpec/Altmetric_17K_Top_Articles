Abstract
Background
The physical impacts of elite sport partici-
pation have been well documented; however, there is
comparatively less research on the mental health and psy-
chological wellbeing of elite athletes.
Objective
This
review
appraises
the
evidence
base
regarding the mental health and wellbeing of elite-level
athletes, including the incidence and/or nature of mental
ill-health and substance use.
Methods
A systematic search of the PubMed, EMBASE,
SPORTDiscus, PsycINFO, Cochrane and Google Scholar
databases, up to and including May 2015, was conducted.
Results
The search yielded a total of 2279 records. Fol-
lowing double screening, 60 studies were included. The
findings suggested that elite athletes experience a broadly
comparable risk of high-prevalence mental disorders (i.e.
anxiety, depression) relative to the general population. Evi-
dence regarding other mental health domains (i.e. eating
disorders, substance use, stress and coping) is less consistent.
These results are prefaced, however, by the outcome of the
quality
assessment
of
the
included
studies,
which
demonstrated that relatively few studies (25 %) were well
reported or methodologically rigorous. Furthermore, there is
a lack of intervention-based research on this topic.
Conclusion
The evidence base regarding the mental
health and wellbeing of elite athletes is limited by a paucity
of
high-quality,
systematic
studies.
Nonetheless,
the
research demonstrates that this population is vulnerable to
a range of mental health problems (including substance
misuse), which may be related to both sporting factors (e.g.
injury, overtraining and burnout) and non-sporting factors.
More high-quality epidemiological and intervention studies
are needed to inform optimal strategies to identify and
respond to player mental health needs.
Key Points
The evidence base regarding the mental health and
wellbeing of elite athletes is limited by a paucity of
high-quality, systematic studies, including
intervention trials.
On the basis of current evidence, elite athletes appear
to experience a broadly comparable risk of high-
prevalence mental disorders relative to the general
population. A greater risk of disorder may be
experienced by elite athletes who are injured,
approaching/in retirement or experiencing
performance difficulty.
While the importance of elite athlete mental health is
gaining increasing attention, targeted, disorder-
specific models of care are yet to be established for
this group. There is scope for such models to
capitalise on early-intervention principles and
establish cross-discipline collaboration.

 1 Introduction
High-quality, systematic studies on the nature and impacts
of physical injuries in elite athletes—most notably, head
injuries/concussion and limb injuries—have led to advan-
ces in how these injuries are optimally managed or, ideally,
prevented. There is comparatively less research on, but
growing interest in, the mental health and psychological
wellbeing of elite-level athletes [1–3]. The prevalence of
diagnosable
psychiatric
disorders
in
this
population
remains a matter of debate [4]; however, notions that elite
athletes are devoid of mental health problems have been
increasingly scrutinised by sports medicine practitioners
[5].
The intense mental and physical demands placed on
elite athletes are a unique aspect of a sporting career, and
these may increase their susceptibility to certain mental
health problems and risk-taking behaviours [9]. Further-
more, the peak competitive years for elite athletes [10] tend
to overlap with the peak age for the risk of onset of mental
disorders [11, 12]. In addition to physical and competition
stress, elite athletes face a unique array of ‘workplace’
stressors, including the pressures of increased public
scrutiny through mainstream and social media, limited
support networks due to relocation, group dynamics in
team sports and the potential for injuries to end careers
prematurely [13–17]. The ways by which athletes appraise
and cope with these stressors can be a powerful determi-
nant of the impact the stressors have on both their mental
health and their sporting success [18].
Athletes tend not to seek support for mental health
problems, for reasons such as stigma, lack of under-
standing about mental health and its potential influence on
performance, and the perception of help seeking as a sign
of weakness [12, 19]. While there have been efforts to
disseminate sport-related mental health findings in order
to advance the prevention, identification and early treat-
ment of psychopathology in elite athletes, there are sug-
gestions that some sporting governing bodies continue to
minimise the significance of mental ill-health in this
population [19]. This has sobering implications if elite
athletes within such organisations are not provided with
access to timely or adequate mental health care, or do not
feel that the culture of the sporting organisation is such
that they can even raise their mental health concerns.
While it is well established that physical activity has a
positive effect on mental health [6, 7], a review has found
that intense physical activity performed at the elite athlete
level
might
instead
compromise
mental
wellbeing,
increasing symptoms of anxiety and depression through
overtraining, injury and burnout [8]. Some, though not all,
research suggests that this population has an increased
risk of mental health problems, including eating disorders
[21] and suicide [22]. A recent national survey of elite
athletes in Australia found that almost half acknowledged
symptoms of at least one of the mental health problems
that were assessed, with prevalence rates similar to those
reported in the community [23]. Emerging research sug-
gests that retired elite athletes may be at particularly
elevated risk of mental ill-health [24], corresponding to
both low rates of formal athlete mental health screening
processes [25] and player perceptions of inadequate
availability of mental health support [26].
Given the early-stage state of sports psychiatry and its
research base, the current delivery of mental health care for
elite athletes might not take into account sport-related
factors that potentially influence vulnerability to mental
health problems, nor diagnostic or treatment issues that
may be unique to this population [4, 19]. Developing a
comprehensive understanding of the mental health and
psychological wellbeing specific to elite athletes has the
potential to advance models of care and management of
this population, which may, in turn, facilitate performance
gains. Such an understanding is required to provide guid-
ance for sport practitioners—including coaches, medical
staff and sport psychologists—in developing the coping
abilities of elite athletes and, in turn, improving their
emotional wellbeing [20].
1.1 Objective
The utility of systematic reviews to synthesise research on
discrete topics and identify gaps in knowledge is well
established; however, to date, there have been no such
reviews of the mental health and psychological wellbeing
of elite athletes. The objective of this review was to syn-
thesise the growing evidence base regarding the incidence
and nature of mental ill-health (including substance use)
and psychological wellbeing among elite-level athletes in
order to identify gaps that future research should prioritise,
and inform strategies or guidelines to advance the detection
and management of mental ill-health in this population.
2 Methods
2.1 Literature Search
A systematic search of five electronic databases (PubMed,
EMBASE,
SPORTDiscus,
PsycINFO,
Cochrane)
was
conducted between January and February 2015, using the
relevant database search engines. A subsequent search was
conducted using the Google Scholar database in May 2015
to ensure that all recently published articles meeting the
1334
S. M. Rice et al.
123
 inclusion criteria were identified. The search strategy for
each database, MeSH descriptors and corresponding num-
ber of hits per database are presented in Electronic Sup-
plementary Material Tables S1 and S2.
2.2 Study Inclusion
Three researchers independently assessed the eligibility of
each retrieved record on the basis of the title and abstract.
If the information was unclear, the full-text article was
screened. All included studies were subsequently re-
screened (i.e. double screened) by a fourth researcher. The
included studies were required to meet the following
inclusion criteria: (1) participants were currently compet-
ing at the elite level, as able-bodied athletes, where the elite
level was defined a priori to be competitive at either the
Olympic, international, national or professional level;
(2) the study reported quantitative data on a mental health,
wellbeing or coping outcome; and (3) the study was pub-
lished in English. Studies were excluded from the review
on the basis of the following criteria: (1) the mean age of
the
participants
was \
18 years;
(2) participants
were
competing at a school or collegiate level; (3) the study was
undertaken with a heterogeneous sample (i.e. a mixed
sample of elite and non-elite athletes) without reporting
group findings separately; (4) the study assessed only
physiological
wellbeing
or
stress
responses
without
assessing or reporting psychological wellbeing; (5) the
study was available in abstract form only (i.e. conference
presentations), precluding full quality assessment; and
(6) the study described substance use focused on perfor-
mance enhancement (i.e. doping) as opposed to personal
use. The systematic review was conducted in accordance
with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (see Fig. 1 for
flow diagram).
2.3 Data Extraction
A standardised data extraction template was designed. One
researcher sourced the required information from the inclu-
ded studies, using this template, including the study type and
design, sport population, study aim, sex ratio and key out-
comes mapped to study measures and main findings.
2.4 Quality Appraisal
Given the heterogeneity of the included study designs and
the lack of randomised, controlled trials identified in the
search process (see Sect. 3.2), it was not possible to con-
duct a standard risk-of-bias assessment. In place of this, all
studies were appraised for reporting quality based on the
established standards outlined below.
3 Results
3.1 Literature Search
The literature search yielded a total of 2279 records. After
screening of the titles and abstracts, 103 studies were
identified as likely meeting the inclusion criteria. After
double screening, exclusion of qualitative studies and a
final manual search of the literature (i.e. screening of ref-
erences lists), a total of 60 studies were included in the
quantitative synthesis (see Fig. 1 for the study selection
diagram).
3.2 Study Design
Sixty quantitative studies were included in the review. The
study designs varied, though most were either cross-sec-
tional observational studies (N = 38; 63.3 %), longitudinal
studies (N = 11; 18.3 %) or of a mixed-method design
(N = 8; 13.3 %). In addition, there were one randomised,
controlled trial (1.6 %), one meta-analysis and one inter-
vention case study report. Given the heterogeneity of both
the study designs and the outcome variables that were
assessed, it was not possible to conduct a meta-analysis as
part of this review.
3.3 Quality Appraisal
The methodological rigour of the included studies was
assessed according to relevant published criteria [27, 28].
Quality appraisal of the 60 studies is presented in Elec-
tronic Supplementary Material Table S3. Only two studies
met all methodological criteria, with one quarter (N = 15;
25 %) assessed to be of good reporting quality (i.e.

 scoring C4 out of 5). The mean quality rating was 2.88
(standard deviation 0.87). Over one third of the remaining
studies (N = 21; 45 %) were assessed to be of moderate
quality (scoring 3 out of 5), while 24 studies (40 %) were
assessed to be of low quality (scoring 2 out of 5). Almost
all included studies (N = 59) defined their participants
well and either reported use of standardised, validated
questionnaires or clearly described the outcomes measured.
Fewer than half of the included studies clearly reported
ethical review (N = 27) and either reported a participant
rate of more than 80 % or, in the absence of that, provided
a description comparing responders with non-responders
(N = 25). Over one quarter of the included studies did not
report on the participant rate (N = 16), and very few used
random sampling (N = 3).
3.4 Description of Included Studies
Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 provide a summary of the key
characteristics and main outcomes of the 60 included
studies. For the purposes of reporting and analysis, studies
were grouped according to the following major mental
health constructs: anger and aggression (N = 2) [29, 30],
anxiety (N = 4) [31–34], eating disorder and body image
(N = 10) [21, 35–43], general-prevalence studies (N = 10)
[23, 44–52], help seeking (N = 1) [11], sleep (N = 1) [53],
stress and coping (N = 22) [64–86], substance use (N = 9)
[54–62] and wellbeing (N = 1) [63]. The included studies
examined athletes from a broad range of individual sports
(e.g. swimming, tennis, wrestling) and team-based sports
(e.g. soccer, football, rugby), with some studies including
elite athletes from a range of sporting disciplines.
3.4.1 Main Findings
Of the two included studies that focused on anger and
aggression (see Table 1), one was conducted with rugby
players [29], while the other was a case study of an elite
table tennis player [30]. Anger tended to be experienced rel-
atively frequently by the rugby players, was viewed as facil-
itative asopposed to debilitative and was positively associated
with anxiety. In both studies, cognitive aspects (self-confi-
dence or problem solving) were associated with less expres-
sion of anger in competition. No studies were found that
evaluated off-field expressions of anger or aggression.
Four studies focused on anxiety in elite athletes (see
Table 2): two on swimmers [32, 33] and two on athletes
from mixed sporting populations [31, 34]. These studies
focused primarily on the performance aspect of symptoms
of anxiety (i.e. where athletic performance is evaluated as
threatening and is associated with elevated levels of arousal
or worry) as opposed to generalised clinical or subclinical
experiences of non-competitive anxiety, which are sum-
marised in the general-prevalence studies listed in Table 4.
Athlete interpretation of anxiety states was identified as
critical to the impact of anxiety. For example, a focus on
performance (as opposed to cooperation and effort) pre-
dicted athlete worry [31], while interpretation of anxiety as
facilitative was associated with more adaptive anxiety
management strategies (i.e. approach-focused coping) [32]
and performance levels [33]. Higher levels of athlete
anxiety were also found to be related to negative patterns of
perfectionism [34]. Recommendations to elite-level coa-
ches included development of athlete skills in appraisal and
interpretation of anxiety states [32] and the type of training
culture facilitated among athletes (i.e. mastery as opposed
to performance) [31].
Of the ten studies examining eating disorders and body
image (see Table 3), six were conducted with mixed popu-
lations [21, 35–37, 40, 43], two with rowers [41, 42] and the
remaining studies with distance runners [38] and fig-
ure skaters [39]. With the exception of the three studies that
used an interviewer-administered diagnostic interview [35,
40, 43], all studies on eating disorders and body image used

 self-report data from standardised measures. Of the ten
studies, five evaluated either eating disorder or body image
issues in comparison with general community samples. The
results from these studies were inconsistent. Three reported a
higher incidence of eating disorder or body dissatisfaction in
elite athletes relative to controls [36], especially in sports
emphasising leanness or lower body weight [21, 35]. In
contrast, one study found no difference between elite athletes
and controls when the sample was restricted to females [43].
The included meta-analytic study that examined differences
in body image reported no differences between athletes and
non-athletes, or by sex or body mass index [37]; however, it
must be noted this meta-analysis used homogenous inclusion
criteria incorporating a large number of studies reporting
data from non-elite athletes. The remaining studies identified
athlete-specific risk factors for eating disorders or body
image concerns, including sport-specific body-type demands
(i.e. leanness) [38–40], age (higher risk in younger athletes)
and sex (higher risk in females) [41, 42]. One study recruiting
only males identified onset-related characteristics of eating
disorders as commencement of training at an earlier age,
dieting and experience of traumatic events, such as signifi-
cant injury [40].
The ten general-prevalence studies on elite athlete
mental health (see Table 4) reported data from either
mixed samples [23, 46, 50, 51] or specific codes, including
football [44], swimming [45], weight lifting [47], eques-
trian [48], distance running [49] and tennis [52]. Sample
sizes for these studies varied on the basis of the population
of interest, ranging from N = 2067 for a national-level
study [51] to N = 14 for a study of distance runners. Of
note, with the exception of one study utilising a structured
diagnostic interview [45] and one study utilising clinician
diagnoses [51], outcomes for general-prevalence studies
were based on athlete self-report data from standardised
measures.
In
the
studies
with
larger
sample
sizes
(N [ 100), combined rates of high-prevalence disorders
(i.e. mood or anxiety disorders) were frequently reported.
In one large self-report study, up to 46.4 % of Australian

dardised

rates
of
depression
(27.2 %), eating disorder (22.8 %) and anxiety disorder
(social phobia; 14.7 %) [23]. Similar findings were repor-
ted for prevalence rates of depression (34 %) based on
diagnostic interviews undertaken with swimmers [45] and
self-reported depression and anxiety (26 %) in European
football players [44], though rates of self-reported depres-
sion were lower (15 %) in a mixed sample of German elite
athletes [50]. Markedly lower case rates, based on clinician
diagnosis, were reported from a large French study (a
mixed sample), with a lifetime prevalence rate for any

 disorder of 25.1 % and recent diagnosis rates of 8.6 % for
anxiety, 4.9 % for eating disorder and 3.6 % for depression
(and 0.6 % for suicidal ideation) [51]. This study did,
however, report relatively frequent sleep problems (de-
layed onset, frequent waking and daytime drowsiness) in
21.5 % of athletes. Major life events, including injury and
chronic stress, were associated with higher rates of distress,
anxiety and depression [23, 44, 50]. The self-report gen-
eral-prevalence studies reporting smaller sample sizes
(N \ 100) were relatively heterogeneous in outcomes.
While male athletes tended to report lower anxiety than
their female counterparts, sex differences in depression
were inconsistent [46, 48]. Lower ratings of depression and
distress were reported in highly achieving athletes [47] and
in older versus younger female athletes [52], with global
mood and anxiety predicting athlete performance [49].
The studies on elite athlete substance use focused on
either alcohol [54, 59, 60], or other drugs [55–58, 61, 62] (see
Table 5). Studies related to alcohol use indicated higher rates
of consumption in athletes relative to the general community
[59, 60]. However, during the playing season, the rates of
risky alcohol use may be lower than general community
levels [54]. Studies focusing on illicit drugs suggested rela-
tively low use (7–8 %) in the previous year [55, 56] but
significantly higher combined lifetime use when athletes
were asked if they knew other athletes who used illicit drugs
(up to 45 %) [62]. These studies reported that knowing
another athlete who had used drugs was a significant

 predictor of their own use. In terms of drug-related attitudes,
there was a tendency for athletes to overestimate levels of
drug use in those competing in sports other than their own
[56]. One intervention study that examined the long-term
effects of an illicit drug–testing programme [58] found that
rates of positive tests among athletes declined over an
extended period, and the authors attributed this to education,
harm minimisation and testing frequency. One study exam-
ined athlete knowledge regarding the effects of illicit drug
use. Despite potential stigma relating to athletes seeking
drug-related information (i.e. fellow players or staff
assuming that information seeking equates to actual drug
use), a substantial proportion of elite athletes expressed a
desire to receive additional information regarding the effects
of some classes of recreational drugs [61].
There were 22 studies examining stress and coping in
elite athletes (see Table 6), comprising nine longitudinal
studies [64–72] and 13 cross-sectional observational stud-
ies [73–85]. Injury, errors on the sporting field, fatigue and
club/organisational climate were identified as common
sources of stress among elite athletes [66, 68, 69, 71, 81,
86]. Four studies emphasised the impact of the coach in
setting the organisational climate [72, 82–84], noting the
negative implications of a performance culture over a
mastery culture for athletes’ stress. Longitudinal studies
found that stress related to injuries, external distractions
and fatigue was highest during training periods [68–71],
while opponents, officials/umpires and the crowd were the
predominant sources of stress for athletes during compe-
tition [70].
The majority of the retrieved studies examined the dif-
ferent strategies employed by elite athletes to cope with the
various stressors that were encountered [64–66, 70, 73–75,
79, 80, 85]. Adaptive, active coping strategies (such as
problem solving, use of imagery, seeking social support
and planning ahead) were frequently reported [66, 71, 81];
however, there was a tendency for athletes to engage in less
adaptive (i.e. avoidance-coping) strategies when faced with
unexpected stressors [73, 76]. One study [79] found that
coping behaviour varied between sporting types, with
athletes in team-based sports more likely to seek social
support than individual competitors, and female athletes
more likely to engage in strategies focused on managing
affect. Coping strategies based on problem solving and
behavioural change were found to be the most effective in
managing stress [64, 70, 77] and developing resilience
[74]. Emotional reactivity and stressful life events were
associated with poor on-field performance and injury [66,
67, 75, 82].
There were single studies identified for the domains of
help seeking [11], sleep [53] and wellbeing [63] (see
Table 7). The help-seeking study was the only randomised,
controlled trial that met the inclusion criteria. While this
small study (N = 59) found no difference between athletes
in the intervention conditions and control conditions with
regard to attitudes, intentions and behaviours related to
mental health help seeking, significant improvements were
noted in depression and anxiety mental health literacy
scores, as well as stigma, at 3-month follow-up [11]. The
one study examining sleep reported on a small sample of
Australian Rules footballers (N = 19) and found that
match-related interstate air travel exerted relatively mini-
mal effects on athlete sleep quality [53]. Finally, the study
examining athlete wellbeing identified distinct profiles,
with feeling unappreciated, greater perfectionism and
lower self-esteem impacting on athlete general wellbeing
[63].
4 Discussion
Researchers have emphasised the limited peer-reviewed
literature regarding the mental health and wellbeing of elite
athletes [9, 19]. This narrative systematic review is the first
to synthesise data from the existing knowledge base with
the goal of identifying the incidence and/or nature of
mental ill-health and substance use in elite athletes. Given
the paucity of research in the field [19], the present review
took a broad and inclusive approach to study both out-
comes and designs. In doing so, it identified the relatively
poor overall quality of study reporting to date and the lack
of well-designed, intervention-based research in the area of
elite athletes’ mental health and wellbeing. Despite the
limitations of the extant literature, a number of key

 observations and tentative conclusions can be drawn from
our data synthesis.
4.1 Elite Athlete Vulnerability to Mental Illness
The data from studies reporting larger samples, although
limited in scope, suggest that elite athletes experience a
broadly comparable risk of high-prevalence mental disor-
ders (i.e. anxiety, depression) relative to the general pop-
ulation [23]. That said, there may be subgroups of athletes
at elevated risk of mental ill-health, including those in the
retirement phase of their careers [44] or those experiencing
performance failure [45]. As in the general population,
major negative life events, including injury [23], may
increase the risk of mental ill-health in elite athletes [50],
though focused quantitative studies with adequate follow-
up assessment periods are needed to confirm this. Findings
regarding the prevalence of eating disorders and body
image concerns relative to the general population were
inconsistent. However, there was a tendency for higher
vulnerability to these conditions in athletes involved in
sports requiring a particularly lean body shape [21, 35, 38–
40] and in female athletes [41–43]—the latter being con-
sistent with the findings of general population studies [87].
Objective data, based on the results of medical review and
tests, would likely assist in the assessment of eating
pathologies and help counter the limitations of self-re-
porting (i.e. underreporting) [88]. Low social support was
noted as a key risk factor for general mental ill-health,
highlighting the importance of both formal and informal
support networks for athletes [44, 46, 66]. All of the
included general-prevalence studies were cross-sectional in
nature. A natural advance for the field will be to assess
athletes prospectively and better identify factors within the
competitive spheres (i.e. performance or team success) and
non-competitive spheres (i.e. approach coping, social
support) for managing symptoms of mental ill-health.
Given the significant overlap between the competitive
years for elite athletes and the peak onset of mental dis-
orders [10–12], future work should also assess low-preva-
lence disorders, such as psychosis or mania, in order to
detect and direct at-risk athletes to early-intervention pro-
grammes or services.
4.2 Elite Athlete Substance Use
Contextual factors also appear important for athlete sub-
stance use, though more rigorous studies are needed. For
example, no research has examined illicit substance
dependence in elite athletes. Nonetheless, higher rates of
alcohol use may occur in elite athletes relative to the
general population, though this may be largely due to a
binge pattern of consumption during non-competitive or
vacation periods [54]. Rates of self-reported illicit drug use
were relatively low in the previous 12 months (i.e. 8 %)
[56], which may be due to rigorous drug-testing procedures
[58]. Further targeted research in the domain of athlete
substance use is warranted, given the frequent harmful
effects (e.g. fighting) reported [54] and the possibility of
patterns of misuse developing in the transition to retire-
ment. Given the possible stigma (i.e. assumed use) asso-
ciated
with
elite
athletes
seeking
drug
information,
improvements to specific, targeted and accessible (i.e.
internet-based) information may be warranted [61].

ated coping strategies employed by athletes to manage

psychosocial stressors (i.e. managing poor performance,
injury or content on social media) rather than specific
strategies for coping with a diagnosable disorder. Adaptive
and maladaptive coping strategies were reported, though
there was a lack of studies that sought to improve athlete
coping. While a small-scale (N = 59), internet-based
intervention failed to boost help-seeking-related attitudes,
intentions or behaviours, increases were noted in mental
health literacy [11]—an essential component of the help-
seeking process. Given that stigma, poor mental health
literacy and negative past experiences of mental health help
seeking are key barriers for elite athletes [12], more well-
designed studies, drawing on larger samples, are needed.
Common athlete-specific stressors noted across studies
included injury, poor performance, fatigue and organisa-
tional factors, such as the coaching environment and
coaching expectations. The consistency of findings related
to athlete stressors highlights these areas as potential ave-
nues for targeted skills-based intervention programmes,
including problem solving [70] and resilience training [74].
Management of athlete-specific stressors was
also
highlighted in the included studies focusing on athlete
performance-related anxiety. Improved coping may be
enabled by coaching staff emphasising a supportive train-
ing culture whereby athletes can interpret performance-
related anxiety as facilitative, developing approach (as
opposed to avoidance) strategies [31, 32]. Indeed, coaching
staff themselves were identified as critical to setting the
organisational climate—in turn, impacting on the level of
stress experienced by athletes [72, 82–84]. Given the
positive associations between coaches emphasising a
mastery climate relative to a performance climate, future
mental health intervention-based research should ensure
the involvement and support of key coaching staff.
4.4 Study Limitations and Future Directions
As indicated, the overall study quality in this field is poor,
and heterogeneous study outcomes prevented the applica-
tion of meta-analytic techniques. In addition, the nature of
participant self-selection may have reduced the represen-
tativeness of the findings. While the included studies
focused specifically on elite-level competition at the
national or international level, differences between the
included sports in terms of training, remuneration, media
pressure and other salient variables must be considered
[89]. Our study did not include athletes with disabilities—a
population in which relatively little is known about mental
health outcomes. Furthermore, most studies used self-re-
porting rather than a diagnostic interview [45]; therefore,
the extent of psychiatric disorders, as opposed to mental
health symptoms or probable ‘caseness’, in this population
remains largely unknown. While some mental health
domains were relatively well represented by the included
studies, other domains—particularly athlete anger and
aggression, help seeking and sleep—had very few studies.
In addition, the included studies generally failed to include
assessment of athlete psychological strengths, and only one
included study assessed wellbeing-related outcomes. Fur-
ther, there is a lack of research focusing on the transition
from playing or competing in elite sport to retirement.
Despite this, the current findings are useful for informing
the next generation of studies focusing on elite athlete
mental health.

progress in sports medicine, performance coaching and

 elite athlete nutrition. As comparatively little progress has
been made in the area of mental health, there is enormous
scope for programmes to boost athlete wellbeing, which
would likely flow on to benefits in competitive perfor-
mance and increase the likelihood of a successful transition
to retirement [24, 26, 49, 90]. Although vulnerability to
mental ill-health might well be relatively comparable in
elite athletes relative to the general community, there is
significant scope for coaches, team psychologists and sport
administrators to focus on targeted screening and early
detection, monitoring and intervention—especially at key
risk periods, such as significant injury [91, 92], transition to
retirement [44, 93] and following performance difficulties
[45]. Specific mental health help-seeking interventions are
being developed for collegiate-level athletes, with a ran-
domised, controlled trial currently underway [94]. The
results of this work are likely to be relevant to elite-level
athletes. Encouraging progress has been made in the
development of mental health guidelines for working with
school-aged athletes [95] and collegiate-level athletes [96–
98]. These guidelines show a growing emphasis on the
need to provide specific and targeted support for the mental
health needs of athletes. They highlight the importance
of monitoring changes in specific observable behaviours,
appreciating psychological history and the need for a
responsive crisis intervention framework specific to
athletes. Development of comprehensive, targeted, dis-
order-specific treatment models are a required next step,
and the National Athletic Trainers’ Association state-
ment on preventing, detecting and managing disordered
eating provides a useful disorder-specific model [99].
Psychoeducation should also extend to substance use—
in particular, alcohol—given the tendency for hazardous
use (bingeing) outside competition periods [100] and the
stigma related to athlete help seeking in this domain
[61].
Development of specific models of psychiatric inter-
vention for elite athletes with significant psychopathology
and impairment appears to be warranted [3, 101]. Such
models should capitalise on an early-intervention frame-
work [102–104], ensuring early detection and prompt
access to high-quality, evidence-based interventions. This
may include implementing mental health screening pro-
grammes alongside physical health checks [25], in addition
to dissemination of mental health awareness support to key

 coaching staff and administrative staff. For this to occur,
collaborative efforts would be required between sports
medicine practitioners, psychiatrists, psychologists and
other mental health professionals [105], mindful of over-
coming treatment barriers and stigma for athletes at the
elite level and balancing the need for treatment with the
need for ongoing performance in, or commitment to, their
chosen career [106].
In addition, from a broader public health perspective,
better engagement of elite athletes in the domains of pos-
itive mental health (and as identifiable role models or
ambassadors) may be significant in mental health stigma
reduction and in boosting help-seeking behaviours and
engagement in services. Importantly, the mental health of
hard-to-engage populations, such as young men [107] and
older men [108, 109], could be targeted. For this, the
research will need to expand from simple cross-sectional
designs and develop innovative strategies to improve ath-
lete help seeking. Technology heralds a unique opportunity
for this, especially given that the next generation of elite
athletes will be digital natives and highly adept at utilising
computer-based or internet-based interventions. Finally,
given the paucity of high-quality studies reported to date,
we encourage sporting bodies to consider public dissemi-
nation of any research (subject to ethical conduct) that is
being conducted within the field of elite athlete mental
health. Such efforts will enable the field to prosper and
develop.
5 Conclusion
Elite athletes experience a unique range of stressors that
may potentially increase their vulnerability to mental ill-
health. Key factors include the psychological impacts of
injury, overtraining and burnout; intense public and media
scrutiny; and managing ongoing competitive pressures to
perform. For the assessment and management of the mental
health needs of elite athletes’ to be on a par with their
physical needs, more high-quality epidemiological and
intervention studies are needed. Ideally, where possible and
appropriate, the results of these should be disseminated
beyond the organisation or sporting code.
