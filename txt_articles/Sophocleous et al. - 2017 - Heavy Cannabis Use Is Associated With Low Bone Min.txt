 Clinical significance: 
• The effects of cannabinoids on bone mass and bone turnover in humans are unknown. 
• Using a cross-sectional study design we found that heavy cannabis use is associated with low body mass 
index, high bone turnover, low bone density and an increased risk of fracture. 
• Heavy cannabis use has a detrimental effect on bone health by a direct effect on the skeleton and an indirect 
effect on body mass index. 
 
 Abstract 
Purpose: To investigate possible associations between recreational cannabis use and bone health in humans. 
Methods: Cross-sectional study of individuals recruited from primary care in the UK between 2011 and 2014.  
Cases were regular smokers of cannabis divided into moderate (n=56) and heavy user (n=144) subgroups 
depending on whether they reported fewer or more than 5000 cannabis smoking episodes during their 
lifetime. Controls comprised 114 cigarette smokers.  
Results: Heavy cannabis users had lower total hip bone mineral density (mean ± SD Z-score: -0.20±0.9 vs. 
+0.2±0.9, p<0.0005), lower spine bone mineral density (-0.5±1.2 vs. 0.0±1.2, p<0.0005) and lower BMI 
(26.5±6.0 vs 29.0±7.0, p=0.01) than controls. Fracture rate was also increased in heavy users (rate ratio=2.17, 
95% confidence interval 1.59 to 2.95; p<0.001). When compared with controls, CTX serum concentrations 
were raised in heavy cannabis users (0.3±0.1 vs. 0.2±0.1 pg/ml, p=0.045) as were P1NP concentrations 
(47.1±19.2 vs. 41.2±17.8 pg/ml, p=0.01). Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were reduced in heavy users 
compared with controls (25.3±16.8 vs. 36.9±26.7 nmol/l, p=0.002). Multiple regression analysis revealed that 
heavy cannabis use was an independent predictor of spine bone mineral density accounting for 5.4% of the 
variance (p=0.035) and total hip bone mineral density accounting for 5.8% of the variance (p=0.001) but 
mediation analysis suggested that the effect on spine bone mineral density was indirect and mediated through 
low BMI. 
Conclusion: Heavy cannabis use is associated with low bone mineral density, low BMI, high bone turnover and 
an increased risk of fracture. Heavy cannabis use negatively impacts on bone health both directly and 
indirectly through an effect on BMI. 
 
 Introduction 
Heavy cannabis use has previously been associated with adverse effects on mental health1,2 and physical 
health3 but also has been found to protect against insulin resistance through an association with reduced body 
mass index.4 While preclinical studies have revealed that cannabinoid receptors and their ligands play 
important roles in regulating bone density, bone turnover and bone cell activity5,6 the effects of cannabis use 
on bone health in humans are unknown.  
We have previously reported that young adult mice with targeted inactivation of the type 1 cannabinoid 
receptor (Cnr1-/-) have increased bone density due to a reduction in osteoclast activity7 and that cannabinoid 
receptor agonists stimulate bone resorption and osteoclast activity in vitro.8 However, with increasing age, 
Cnr1-/- mice show increased rates of bone loss due to defects in osteoblast differentiation and accumulation of 
adipocytes in the bone marrow.9 Mice with deficiency of the type 2 cannabinoid receptor (Cnr2-/-) also show 
enhanced bone loss with age due to reduced bone formation.5,10,11 In keeping with this, type 2 cannabinoid 
receptor agonists stimulate osteoblast proliferation and promote bone nodule formation in vitro.12,13 The 
GPR55 receptor has also been reported to influence osteoclast differentiation in vitro and bone mass in vivo. 
Specifically, male mice with inactivation of GPR55 have increase bone mass and increased bone resorption 
whereas the GPR55 antagonist cannabidiol inhibits osteoclast formation induced by the GPR55 agonist 
lipophosphatidylinosotol.14 The complexity of the situation is emphasised by the fact that the effects of 
cannabinoid receptor deficiency in mouse models are age and gender dependent10,15 as well as being 
dependent on background strain of the mice.16 
The aim of this study was to determine if heavy cannabis use influences bone metabolism in humans. In order 
to achieve this aim we investigated the association between recreational use of cannabis and various markers 
of bone health in a cross-sectional study of 170 regular cannabis users and 114 controls recruited from a single 
inner city general practice in the United Kingdom. 
Materials and methods 
Study subjects 
We approached individuals aged >18 who were attending a general practice surgery for routine appointments 
between November 2011 and March 2013. Individuals were invited to take part if they had a history of current 
or previous use of tobacco or cannabis. After providing written informed consent participants completed a 
questionnaire in which details were collected on demographics, smoking and alcohol intake, cannabis use, use 
 of other illegal drugs, dietary calcium intake by food frequency questionnaire, fracture history, family history 
of hip fracture, participation in sports, whether the subjects were weight bearing for more than 4 hours a day 
and medical history. Participants were also invited to undergo bone densitometry and to provide a blood 
sample for biochemical analysis.  
Ethics 
The study was approved by NHS Lothian Research & Development (project number: 2011/W/RH/01) and 
South East Scotland Research Ethics Committee 01 (reference number: 11/SS/0029). 
Bone mineral density measurements 
Bone density was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) using a QDR 4500 densitometer 
(Hologic, Bedford, MA, USA). The coefficient of variation was 1.4%, 1.3% and 1.2% for femoral neck, lumbar 
spine and total hip, respectively. The bone mineral density measurements were expressed as g/cm2 as well as 
gender specific Z-scores using the manufacturer’s reference data.  
Biochemical measurements 
Serum creatinine was measured using standard techniques. Serum N-terminal propeptide of type 1 
procollagen (P1NP) and C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX) were measured using enzyme 
chemiluminescent immunoassays on a COBAS 600 analyser (Roche Products Ltd, Penzberg, Germany) with a 
CV of <4% for P1NP and <5% for CTX across the working range of the assay. Serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D 
[25(OH)D] was measured using tandem mass spectrometry. For this assay, 25(OH)D2 and D3 were extracted 
from serum after zinc sulphate protein precipitation using Isolute solid phase C18 extraction cartridges. 
Potential interfering substances were removed by initial elution by 50% methanol followed by elution of the 
vitamins using 10% tetrahydrofuran in acetonitrile. Dried extracts were reconstituted prior to injection into a 
High Performance Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometer (LC-MS/MS) (Platinum Ultima Waters 
UK) in multiple reaction mode. The assay has a limit of detection of 2.5 nmol/L for D3 and 2.5 nmol/L for D2 and 
a CV of <10% for both D3 and D2 across the working range. The assay was calibrated using NIST aligned 
calibration material and has achieved certification in the Vitamin D External Quality Assessment Scheme 
(DEQAS) scheme. 
Sample size 
The study was powered to provide 90% or greater power to detect a 0.4-0.5 Z-score units difference in bone 
mineral density between heavy cannabis users and controls, which we felt it would be a clinically significant 
 difference. Based on this assumption between 80 and 130 participants were required in the heavy cannabis 
use and control groups.  
Statistical methods 
Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 19 (IBM, Armonk, NY). Bootstrap analysis 
was conducted to account for missing and/or non-normally distributed data.17,18 Data was missing completely 
at random (Little’s missing completely at random [MCAR] test = 0.61) and accounted only for 1.15% of the 
total data. Differences between cannabis use groups were assessed by General Linear Model (GLM) using 
bootstrapped values for continuous variables and by Chi-square test for categorical variables. Multiple linear 
regression analysis with bootstrapping was employed to determine whether heavy cannabis use was a 
significant independent predictor of bone mineral density at the lumbar spine, femoral neck and total hip 
among other possible predictors including:  age, gender, BMI, menopausal status, 25[OH]D, P1NP, CTX, 
tobacco smoking, alcohol intake, dietary calcium intake, participation in sports, weight bearing for >4 hours 
daily and other illegal drugs use. All these variables were previously shown to contribute to the variance of 
bone mineral density.19-28 The R2 indicates the proportion of the variance of the dependant variable that is 
explained collectively by all variables. Relative weight analysis was performed as previously described29 in 
order to determine the relative importance of each of the predictor variables and hence how much variance is 
explained by each one of them. The raw resulting weights range from 0 to 1 and their sum equals to R2. 
PROCESS macro for SPSS, (v. 2.15) was used to investigate A) the potential indirect effect between heavy 
cannabis use and bone mineral density via theoretically specified mediators (here BMI and dietary calcium 
intake; model 4) and B) possible interactions with moderator variables (here other drug use; model 5) (Figure 
1). For both models the PROCESS macro implements a Bootstrap inference and outputs a 95% confidence 
interval. Other drug use was inserted in the model as a moderator rather than mediator since proposed 
mediators should not be categorical variables.30 To compare the number of fractures between groups, the 
incidence rate ratio was calculated by counting the number of fractures that had occurred since the age of 
starting cannabis use (or the age of starting smoking for the controls) and the difference between groups was 
calculated by Revman 5.3 software. The significance level was set at p=0.05 with the Bonferroni correction 
applied for multiple comparisons. 
Results 
Participant characteristics 
 Relevant clinical and demographic details of the study population are shown in Table 1 in which cannabis users 
were divided into moderate and heavy subgroups. Moderate cannabis use was defined as taking cannabis on 
more than 5 and less than 5000 times and heavy cannabis use defined as taking cannabis on more than 5000 
occasions as suggested by Gruber et al.31 Participants with 5 or fewer exposures were classified as controls. 
Heavy cannabis users were younger than controls and they reported taking other illegal drugs more 
frequently. Details of the illegal drugs taken other than cannabis in each group are shown in Table 2. There was 
a predominance of males in the heavy cannabis user group and fewer of the females were postmenopausal as 
compared with the controls and moderate users. Dietary calcium intake was higher in heavy cannabis users 
than in controls but body mass index (BMI) was significantly lower. There was no difference between the 
groups in alcohol intake, the proportion of individuals with a family history of hip fracture or the proportion 
who reported taking part in sports regularly. However, the proportion of heavy cannabis users who reported 
standing for more than 4 hours a day was lower than the control group. Moderate cannabis users were 
younger than controls, and of the females, fewer were postmenopausal. Moderate cannabis users smoked 
fewer cigarettes and took more illegal drugs than controls but otherwise had similar characteristics to the 
controls. 
Bone mineral density and biochemical markers  
Associations between cannabis use and markers of bone health are summarised in Table 3. Bone mineral 
density, expressed as the gender specific Z-score was significantly lower in heavy cannabis users when 
compared with controls at the lumbar spine, femoral neck and total hip. Serum concentrations of the c-
terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX) and the amino terminal propeptide fragment of type I collagen 
(PINP) were significantly higher in heavy cannabis users as compared with controls. Conversely, heavy cannabis 
users had significantly lower total 25(OH)D than controls. There was no significant correlation between 
25(OH)D levels and either CTX or PINP concentrations (data not shown) 
Fractures were also more common in heavy cannabis users. 
Multiple linear regression analysis 
To evaluate the relative contribution of cannabis exposure to the reduction in bone mineral density as 
opposed to other variables we employed multiple linear regression analysis using bone mineral density at each 
skeletal site as the dependent variable, and age, gender, BMI, menopausal status (yes/no), serum 25(OH)D 
(nmol/L), serum PINP (g/L), serum CTX (g/L), tobacco smoking (pack years), alcohol (units/week), dietary 
 calcium intake (mg/day), participation in sports (yes/no), weight bearing for >4 hours daily (yes/no), and use of 
other illegal drugs (yes/no) as explanatory variables. All these variables were previously shown to contribute to 
the variance of bone mineral density.19-24,26-28 Heavy cannabis use was introduced as a final possible predictor 
in the model, since it was the main variable of interest. The results, summarised in Table 4, showed that heavy 
cannabis use was an independent predictor of low bone mineral density at all three skeletal sites. Relative 
weight analysis29 showed that the heavy cannabis use explained 5.4% (p=0.035), 3.9% (p=0.010) and 5.8% 
(p=0.001) of the variance in bone mineral density at the lumbar spine, femoral neck and total hip, respectively. 
Body mass index explained a large part the variance at the lumbar spine (38.7%, p=0.002), femoral neck 
(32.3%, p=0.001) and total hip (55.2%, p=0.001). 
Mediation and moderation analyses 
Mediation and moderation analyses were performed in order to examine the potential mechanisms by which 
heavy cannabis use affects bone mineral density at each skeletal site, taking other predictive factors into 
account. Mediation analysis provides an insight into whether the effects of a variable of interest on an 
endpoint of interest is mediated directly or indirectly and moderation analysis predicts whether the effects of 
this variable on the outcome of interest are influence by a moderator variable .30 The results of the analysis are 
summarised in Table 4 and Figure 2. For lumbar spine the mediation model included heavy cannabis intake, 
BMI and dietary calcium intake since these variables were found to be independent predictors of bone mineral 
density at this site by regression analysis. The model showed that the effects of heavy cannabis use on spine 
bone mineral density were indirect and mediated through BMI and paradoxically by dietary calcium intake 
which was increased in heavy cannabis users (Figure 2). However, the  coefficient of BMI mediation (negative 
effect) was larger than the  coefficient of mediation through dietary calcium intake (positive effect) resulting 
in an overall negative effect on spine bone mineral density (Table 4). Similar analyses for femoral neck and 
total hip bone mineral density included heavy cannabis use, age, gender, BMI and other illicit drug use which 
were found to be independent predictors of bone mineral density at these sites by regression analysis. BMI 
was considered as a possible mediator, other drug use was added as a moderator and age and gender were 
added as covariates. Mediation and moderation analyses showed that heavy cannabis use had a direct 
negative effect on femoral neck and total hip bone mineral density, with other drugs influencing this 
relationship. However, among those that did not take other drugs, the relationship between heavy cannabis 
use and total hip bone mineral density was also negative and statistically significant (Table 4). 
 Discussion 
Cannabinoid receptors and their ligands play key roles in several physiological and pathological processes.1,32,33 
The type 1 (CNR1) and type 2 (CNR2) cannabinoid receptors5,9,12 as well as the orphan cannabinoid receptor 
GPR5514 and their ligands have previously been reported to influence bone cell function, bone turnover and 
bone mass in mice with complex effects that are dependent on the ligand tested and the experimental system 
used.5,10 With this in mind, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of recreational cannabis 
use on bone health in humans, given that cannabis is one of the most widely used illegal drugs. The Cannabis 
sativa plant contains more than 100 cannabinoids but the most important are 9- tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 
a partial agonist at the CNR1 and CNR2 receptors and cannabidiol (CBD) an antagonist at the GPR55 receptor.32 
Based on previous research, both of these cannabinoid receptor ligands might be expected to influence bone 
metabolism in man,5 but it is difficult to predict what the overall effects on bone health might be given the fact 
that the effects of cannabinoid receptor ligands on the skeleton in preclinical studies are influenced by age, 
gender and genetic background. 
The main findings to emerge from the present study were that heavy cannabis users had reduced bone density 
at all sites measured as compared with controls as well as a reduced body mass index, high bone turnover and 
an increased rate of fractures. The heavy cannabis user group also differed from the controls in age and 
gender distribution, serum 25(OH)D concentrations and dietary calcium intake as well as the proportion of 
time spent weight bearing each day. In view of the complexity of the situation we performed multiple 
regression analysis to determine if heavy cannabis use was an independent predictor of bone mineral density. 
The regression analysis identified heavy cannabis use as an independent predictor of bone mineral density at 
all three skeletal sites with a relative contribution to the total amount of variance explained of 5.8% at the 
spine, 3.9% at the femoral neck and 5.4% at the total hip. Other significant predictors were body mass index 
and dietary calcium for spine bone mineral density; and age, gender, body mass index and use of other illegal 
drugs for hip bone mineral density.  
In order to evaluate to what extent the effects of heavy cannabis use on bone density were direct or indirect 
we performed mediation analysis. This showed that while heavy cannabis use was an independent predictor of 
bone mineral density at the spine, the effects were indirect and mediated by reduced BMI but offset to an 
extent by high dietary calcium intake. At the femoral neck and total hip there was evidence of a direct effect 
heavy cannabis use on bone mineral density but that other illegal drug use was a moderator of the effect. 
 However, heavy cannabis use negatively influenced total hip bone mineral density even among those who did 
not use other illegal drugs. 
The lower BMI that was observed in heavy cannabis users at first sight seems counterintuitive since agonists at 
the CNR1 receptor stimulate appetite.34 However several investigators have found that cannabis users have 
lower BMI values when compared with controls.4,35 The underlying mechanisms are unclear but it has been 
speculated that with long term use, THC might act as an antagonist at CNR1 and CNR2 receptors and reduce 
food intake through central and peripheral mechanisms.35 
So far as we are aware this is the first study of bone health in cannabis users. A notable strength is that we 
investigated a well characterised population of cannabis users who were matched with controls from the same 
geographical location. However the participants were derived from an inner city general practice in the UK and 
about two thirds of the heavy cannabis users had also taken other illicit drugs. While we cannot infer a cause 
and effect relationship between cannabis use and low bone mineral density because of the observational 
nature of the study, the participants underwent detailed phenotyping and we were able to correct for 
potential confounding factors through regression and mediation analysis which suggested that the association 
with low bone mineral density that we observed was due in part to the effects of cannabis. While further 
research will be required to investigate the mechanisms underlying the association we observed the findings 
reported here have important clinical implications in identifying heavy cannabis use as potential cause of low 
bone mineral density, increased bone turnover and predisposition to fractures.

The standardised beta coefficient (), 95% confidence intervals (95% CI); and standard error (SE) are shown 
taking into account the independent predictors of bone density at each skeletal site, which were BMI and 
dietary calcium intake for the spine; and BMI, other illegal drug use, age and gender at the hip sites. Significant 
effects (whether direct or indirect) are indicated when the 95% confidence intervals do not cross zero. +Age 
and gender used as covariates. 
  
 
 
 
 Figure 1. Models of mediation and moderation analyses. 
 
Models of used for PROCESS to theoretically assess mediation and moderation of the effects of heavy cannabis 
use on bone mineral density outcomes. 
 
 
Figure 2. Results of mediation analysis 
Mediation analysis showed that the effects of heavy cannabis use on spine bone mineral density were indirect 
and mediated by a reduced BMI whereas there was evidence for a direct effect on bone mineral density at the 
hip. See Table 4 and text for more details
