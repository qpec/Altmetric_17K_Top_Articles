IMPORTANCE Raising the price of cigarettes by increasing taxation has been associated with
improved perinatal and child health outcomes. Transnational tobacco companies have sought
to undermine tobacco tax policy by adopting pricing strategies that maintain the availability
of budget cigarettes.
OBJECTIVE To assess associations between median cigarette prices, cigarette price
differentials, and infant mortality across the European Union.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A longitudinal, ecological study was conducted from
January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2014, of infant populations in 23 countries (comprising 276
subnational regions) within the European Union.
INTERVENTIONS Median cigarette prices and the differential between these and minimum
cigarette prices were obtained from Euromonitor International. Pricing differentials were
calculated as the proportions (%) obtained by dividing the difference between median and
minimum cigarette price by median price. Prices were adjusted for inflation.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Annual infant mortality rates. Associations were assessed
using linear fixed-effect panel regression models adjusted for smoke-free policies, gross
domestic product, unemployment rate, education, maternal age, and underlining temporal
trends.
RESULTS Among the 53 704 641 live births during the study period, an increase of €1 (US
$1.18) per pack in the median cigarette price was associated with a decline of 0.23 deaths per
1000 live births in the same year (95% CI, –0.37 to –0.09) and a decline of 0.16 deaths per
1000 live births the following year (95% CI, –0.30 to –0.03). An increase of 10% in the price
differential between median-priced and minimum-priced cigarettes was associated with an
increase of 0.07 deaths per 1000 live births (95% CI, 0.01-0.13) the following year. Cigarette
price increases across 23 European countries between 2004 and 2014 were associated with
9208 (95% CI, 8601-9814) fewer infant deaths; 3195 (95% CI, 3017-3372) infant deaths could
have been avoided had there been no cost differential between the median-priced and
minimum-priced cigarettes during this period.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Higher cigarette prices were associated with reduced infant
mortality, while increased cigarette price differentials were associated with higher infant
mortality in the European Union. Combined with other evidence, this research suggests that
legislators should implement tobacco tax and price control measures that eliminate budget
cigarettes.

ncreasing cigarette prices through increased taxation has
proven to be the single most effective tobacco control
measure.1 Previous studies have documented substantial
health benefits of tobacco taxation derived from associated re-
ductions in smoking prevalence, cigarette consumption
among smokers, and exposure to second-hand smoke (SHS),2
including reductions in infant mortality3,4 most likely medi-
ated by decreases in maternal smoking and fetal and infant
exposure to SHS.5,6
Transnational tobacco companies have responded to in-
creased tobacco taxation with differential pricing strategies,
whereby tax increases are loaded onto premium brands
(eFigure 1 in the Supplement).7 The resulting price gap be-
tween premium and budget cigarettes attenuates the effec-
tiveness of tax increases in reducing smoking prevalence, as
smokers can switch to less-expensive products. The Euro-
pean Union (EU) has adopted a mixed tax system for tobacco
products, including a minimum excise tax burden and an ex-
cise tax floor.8 As a result, overall prices have increased in both
high-income and middle-income countries.9 Cigarettes have
become less affordable in the EU since 2003, although this is
not uniform across countries,10,11 as member states can im-
pose excise taxes exceeding minimum EU requirements and
may have different value added tax rates. There is still a con-
siderable gap between prices for premium and budget brand
cigarettes across the EU.
Researchontheeffectofpricedifferentialsincigarettemar-
kets on tobacco-related health outcomes is sparse, which con-
stitutes an important knowledge gap given transnational to-
bacco company strategies to load tax increases onto premium
cigarettes.7 Tobacco pricing strategies are also important for
tobacco control in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)
where cigarette price differentials are generally larger than in
high-income countries.1 We used data from 23 EU countries to
examine associations between median cigarette prices, price
differentials between cigarette brands, and infant mortality.
We hypothesized that increased price differentials in EU ciga-
rette markets would be associated with higher rates of infant
mortality.
Methods
We conducted a longitudinal ecological study using region-
level data from 23 EU countries to assess associations be-
tweenmediancigaretteprices,cigarettepricedifferentials,and
infant mortality. Because this study used routinely collected
anonymized data aggregated to regional and national levels,
ethical approval was not required.
Data Sources
European Commission
We extracted region-level data from Eurostat,12 the official EU
statistical authority. The EU, which has 28 member coun-
tries, is further divided into 3 levels of Nomenclature of
Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) regions, including 276
subnational (NUTS-2) regions. We extracted annual data on
rates of infant mortality (infant deaths under 1 year of age per
1000 live births), educational level (percentage of the popu-
lation aged 25-64 years with tertiary education), current mar-
ket gross domestic product per inhabitant, and unemploy-
ment rate (among the population aged >15 years) at a NUTS-2
level.12 We also extracted annual data on maternal age at
delivery and calculated the proportion of mothers younger
than 18 years or 40 years of age or older for each NUTS-2
region, as these age groups are known to be associated with
higher infant mortality.13 Data were available for all countries
from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2014.
Euromonitor Passport
EuromonitorInternational14collectsthepricesoftobaccoprod-
ucts in EU countries (except for Croatia, Malta, Cyprus,
Luxembourg, and Austria). They record the prices of multiple
cigarette products in retail outlets every year, covering at least
the top 10 brands with the highest market share in each
country. We obtained annual price data for 23 EU countries for
2004 and 2006-2014. Data for 2005 were not available, as
EuromonitorInternationalwasnotcollectingdataannuallybe-
fore 2006. A median of 93 (interquartile range, 58-184) ciga-
rette products were sampled in each country each year. Prices
were recorded in the national currency; for countries not using
the euro, prices were transformed into Euros using the ex-
change rate on June 30 of the respective year. We calculated
minimum and median prices per 20 cigarettes (1 pack) for each
country and year. Data for 2005 were imputed with linear in-
terpolation using data from 2004 and 2006. To assess the va-
lidityofthisapproach,weusedexistingdatapoints(ie,forother
years) and found that interpolation accurately estimated price
data in years for which price data were available (median dif-
ferencebetweenactualandinterpolatedpriceswas1.1%forme-
dian and 0.2% for minimum cigarette prices). To capture dif-
ferential pricing of cigarette products that may lead smokers
to switch from expensive to cheaper products, we calculated
the price differential between the minimum and the median
cigarette price. We expressed this as a percentage of the
median cigarette price for every year and country.
Tobacco Control Scale
Smoke-free legislation has been associated with reduced in-
fant mortality.15 We used scores from the Smokefree Work and
Other Public Places subscale of the Tobacco Control Scale
Key Points
Question Are differentials in cigarette prices associated with
increased infant mortality?
Findings In this longitudinal, ecological study, increases in the
median price of cigarettes were associated with reductions in
infant mortality across Europe between 2004 and 2014. However,
pricing differentials between median and minimum cigarette
prices were associated with increases in infant mortality.
Meaning Pricing differentials between cigarette products with
widespread availability of budget cigarettes are likely to produce
adverse child health outcomes; legislators should implement
measures to eliminate budget cigarettes globally.

 (TCS)16-18 to adjust for smoke-free policies within each coun-
try. The highest possible score in this subscale is 22. Country-
level TCS scores have been published for 2005, 2007, 2010,
and 2013.16-18 We also collected data from official reports of the
European Commission on smoke-free legislation imple-
mented in EU countries during the study period.19,20 Based on
legislation and scoring criteria of the TCS,18 we estimated TCS
smoke-free scores for years when official TCS scores were not
available. We created a binary variable (comprehensive bans
vs noncomprehensive bans) from the TCS smoke-free score
using a cutoff of 18 points, as substantial health benefits and
reductions in SHS exposure are generally achievable through
comprehensive smoke-free legislation,21 but we also con-
ducted a sensitivity analysis using TCS smoke-free score as a
continuous variable.
Statistical Analysis
The main outcome of our analysis was the rate of infant mor-
tality (infant deaths per 1000 live births). Consistent with pre-
vious research on this topic,3,4 we fitted a linear fixed-effects
panel regression model with robust standard errors. Panel
regression models are widely used for exploiting data rou-
tinely collected over time across multiple units. In our study,
the unit of analysis was NUTS-2 region with annual observa-
tions for the period 2004-2014. Panel regressions account for
the clustered nature of the observations (ie, annual observa-
tions within region).22 We used a fixed-effects specification to
control for time-invariant region-level unobserved factors that
could be associated with independent variables. Fixed-
effects panel regressions estimate associated changes
between independent and outcome variables within regions
over time, but do not estimate between-region associations.
The choice of a fixed-effects specification was supported by
the Hausman specification test.22
We have drawn a detailed directed acyclic graph with
DAGitty23 to illustrate potential causal pathways from ciga-
rettepricestoinfantmortality,identifypotentialsourcesofcon-
founding, and guide covariate selection (eFigure 2 in the
Supplement). Model specification was determined by com-
paring Bayesian information criterion and Akaike informa-
tion criterion and considering availability and completeness
of data at the NUTS-2 level. Some health outcomes of reduced
cigarette consumption and exposure to SHS during pregnancy
may only be detected the following year (owing to 9 months’
gestation).Therefore,ourfinalmodelincludedwithin-yearand
1-year lagged terms for the median cigarette price and the price
differential, adjusting for potential confounders (gross domes-
tic product per capita, unemployment, TCS smoke-free score,
educationallevel,andmaternalage),andtime(quadraticterm)
to account for underlying nonlinear time trends. Mediators of
the association between cigarette prices and infant mortality,
such as population-level cigarette consumption, smoking in
pregnancy, exposure to SHS in pregnancy and infancy, congen-
ital anomalies, and preterm birth were not included in the
model, consistent with our directed acyclic graph.24,25
Gross domestic product per capita and tobacco prices were
adjusted for inflation using the Harmonised Index of Con-
sumerPrices.12Atotalof84of2527potentialdatapoints(3.3%)
with missing values of infant mortality (60 [2.4%]), unem-
ployment (75 [3.0%]), education (56 [2.2%]) or maternal age
(75 [3.0%]) were excluded from the analysis. We performed a
sensitivity analysis using values of the smoke-free compo-
nent of TCS only for years when the TCS was published (2005,
2007, 2010, and 2013). Results are presented as β coefficients
with robust 95% CIs and can be interpreted as changes in rates
of infant mortality (infant deaths per 1000 live births) in the
regionper1-unitincreaseoftheindependentvariable.Thevari-
able for price differential was scaled to show β coefficients for
a 10% increase in price differential.
We used the “predict” command in Stata (StataCorp LLC)
and the coefficients from our main model to estimate the ex-
pected number of infant deaths by region and year in the fol-
lowing counterfactual scenarios: if median cigarette prices had
remained at 2004 levels throughout the study period, and if
the price differential between median and budget cigarettes
was fixed at zero for the entire study period. We used the same
approach to calculate the number of deaths expected with our
model using actual observed values of prices and price differ-
entials. We subsequently compared the 2 scenarios with our
model’
s expected number of deaths made on observed val-
ues to estimate the averted number of infant deaths (with 95%
CI) associated with increases in median cigarette price during
the study period and the increase in the number of infant
deaths associated with cigarette price differentials. Both es-
timates accounted for both within-year and lagged associa-
tions and refer to the period 2005-2014.
Results
There were a total of 53 704 641 live births recorded in the 276
NUTS-2 regions with complete data between 2004 and 2014,
representing 96% of all live births across the 23 EU countries.
Descriptive characteristics are shown in eTable 1 in the
Supplement.12 Infant mortality declined in all countries dur-
ing the study period, with reductions up to 50% in countries
thatjoinedtheEUafter2003(Figure1).Themedianinfantmor-
tality rate was 4.4 deaths per 1000 live births in 2004 (range,
3.1 in Sweden to 16.8 in Romania) and 3.5 per 1000 live births
in 2014 (range, 1.8 in Slovenia to 8.4 in Romania) (eTable 2 in
the Supplement).
Both median and minimum cigarette prices (adjusted for
inflation) increased in all 23 countries during the study pe-
riod (Figure 2). Ireland and the United Kingdom consistently
had the highest minimum and median prices. The lowest ciga-
rette prices were in countries that became EU members after
2003. Overall, minimum prices for a pack of 20 cigarettes in
2004 ranged from €0.42 (US $0.49) in Bulgaria and Romania
to €6.32 (US $7.45) in Ireland (median minimum price across
the 23 countries, €2.16 [US $2.55]) and in 2014 ranged from
€2.09 (US $2.46) in Bulgaria to €8.32 (US $9.81) in Ireland (me-
dianminimumprice,€3.60[US$4.24])(eTable3inthe Supple-
ment). Similarly, median prices per pack in 2004 ranged from
€0.93 (US $1.10) in Bulgaria to €8.14 (US $9.59) per pack in the
UK (median, €2.68 [US $3.16]) and in 2014 ranged from €2.40
(US $2.83) in Bulgaria to €10.00 (US $11.79) in Ireland (median,

 €4.10 [US $4.83]) (eTable 4 in the Supplement). The relative
price differential decreased over time, except for Ireland and
Portugal, where it was higher in 2014 compared with 2004.
The median price differential was 24.6% in 2004 (range, 5.0%
in France to 65.5% in Romania), meaning that the least-
expensive cigarettes were 24.6% cheaper than the median-
priced cigarettes. In 2014, the median differential was 12.8%
(range, 0.5% in France to 25.4% in Poland) (eTable 5 in the
Supplement).
In the multivariable linear fixed-effects panel regression
model, an increase of €1 per pack in the median cigarette price
wasassociatedwith0.23fewerdeathsper1000livebirths(95%
CI,–0.37to–0.09)inthesameyearandanadditional0.16fewer
deaths per 1000 live births in the following year (95% CI, –0.30
to –0.03) (Table). An increase of 10% in the price differential
between median and minimum cigarette price was associated
with 0.07 more deaths per 1000 live births (95% CI, 0.01-0.13)
the following year, while the association was nonsignificant in
the same year (β, –0.04; 95% CI, –0.08 to 0.01). Within-region
changes in educational level, smoke-free legislation, and mac-
roeconomic factors were not associated with the rate of infant
mortality rate in the same year. Maternal age younger than 18
years or 40 years or older was associated with a higher infant
mortalityrate(Table).Resultsfromthesensitivityanalyseswere
largely consistent with our main findings (eTable 6 in the
Supplement).
Incomparisonwithacounterfactualscenarioinwhichciga-
rette prices remained unchanged since 2004, actual median
price increases for cigarettes were associated with 9208 (95%
CI, 8601-9814) fewer infant deaths between 2005 and 2014.
In a counterfactual scenario in which there was no price dif-
ferential between median and minimum cigarette price, we es-
timated that a further 3195 (95% CI, 3017-3372) infant deaths
would have been averted.
Discussion
We analyzed regional data from 23 EU countries between 2004
and 2014 and found that increases in cigarette prices were as-
sociated with lower rates of infant mortality. Larger differ-
ences between median and minimum cigarette prices were as-
sociated with increased rates of infant mortality. Median price
increases during the study period were associated with 9208
fewerinfantdeaths,butafurther3195infantdeathscouldhave
been averted if no price difference between minimum-priced
and median-priced cigarettes existed.
To our knowledge, no previous studies have examined the
associationofpricedifferentialsintobaccomarketswithhealth
outcomes. A previous study in the United States found that a
cigarette tax increase of $1 per pack was associated with 0.19
fewer deaths per 1000 live births.3 Canadian data showed that
a 10% increase in tobacco taxes was associated with a 1.8% de-
cline in infant mortality.4 Both estimates are consistent with
our results. The association between tobacco prices and lower
infant mortality is likely mediated by decreases in maternal

 dates.15,28,29 It may also reflect lagged associations of price
changes with smoking behavior. Although previous work has
linked increases in tobacco price to smoking cessation31 and
reduced smoking rates overall,32 changes in smoking behav-
iors may not be immediate. Comprehensive smoke-free leg-
islation has previously been associated with lower infant
mortality in England.15 However, our analysis showed no
associationattheEUlevel.TheTCSsmoke-freescore—asacon-
tinuous variable—was also not associated with infant mortal-
ity. We used annual data, which may not have fully captured
outcomesofchangesinlegislationimplementedduringthecal-
endar year, such as the introduction of comprehensive smoke-
free legislation in England banning smoking in virtually all
indoor public places.
We analyzed EU data from a period during which tobacco
taxationandpricesincreasedinallEUcountries.Countriesthat
were members of the EU before 2004 implemented smaller tax
increases, but still had higher taxes compared with the new-
est members by 2010.10 Prices33 and affordability of ciga-
rettes continue to vary greatly among EU countries11 and free
movement across borders within the EU allows some smok-
ers to exploit price differences between countries to obtain
cheaper cigarettes.33,34 Although our study could not mea-
sure this behavior, it highlights the need for further harmoni-
zation of taxation strategies to strengthen individual coun-
tries’tobacco control measures.
Reliance on heavy excise taxes (which the World Health
Organization recommends should account for >70% of the re-
tailprice),1annualpriceincreasesaboveinflation,andstrength-
eningmechanismsoftobaccotaxadministrationmaximizethe
health benefits of tobacco taxation.2 This robust body of evi-
dence can motivate governments to increase taxes. We could
notexploretheeffectofpricedifferencesbetweencigarettesand
other tobacco products, such as loose tobacco, which has been
subjecttolowertaxationintheEU.35However,ourfindingsun-
derscoretheadditionalimportanceofaddressingcigaretteprice
differentials through taxation for population health. This is an
important and topical issue within Europe, as a revision of the
EUtobaccotaxationdirectiveiscurrentlyunderway.36Taxmea-
sures introduced in the UK that explicitly target budget ciga-
rettes appear to have been effective at reducing the differen-
tial in cigarette prices (eFigure 1 in the Supplement).37 In 2016,
the UK government additionally signaled an intention to intro-
duce a minimum excise tax,38 which will help establish an ef-
fectiveminimumcigaretteprice,recognizingthatsmokerscom-
monly switch to less expensive types of tobacco.39
Our findings highlight the potential benefits of increas-
ing taxation and reducing cigarette price differentials on child
health outcomes in Europe. Although high-income countries
can further improve child health outcomes through strength-
ening tobacco control, our findings are particularly impor-
tant for LMICs, where rates of infant mortality remain unac-
ceptably high and cigarette price differentials are generally
greater than in high-income countries. Although maternal
smoking is often low in LMICs and the principal harm is de-
rived from exposure to SHS during pregnancy, this scenario is
likely to change as the tobacco industry is increasingly target-
ing young women in these settings.40-42 Reduced reliance on
ad valorem taxes in the EU means that tobacco prices are gen-
erally much higher than in LMICs, where transnational to-
bacco companies may have greater flexibility in adopting dif-
ferential pricing strategies.1,2,43 A recent modeling analysis in
China, the largest tobacco consumer in the world, found that
an increase of tobacco taxes by 50% could achieve substantial
health and financial gains, particularly among the poor.44 Re-
searchandpolicyrecommendationsspecificallytargetingprice
differentials are scarce. Bespoke taxation structures that mini-
mize the availability of budget cigarettes and other tobacco
products may be required to effectively counteract potential
transnational tobacco company pricing strategies. Further re-
search on the effects of price differentials between cigarettes
and other tobacco products, such as loose tobacco, and the ef-
fect of cross-country price differences is also warranted.
Strengths and Limitations
To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the asso-
ciation between cigarette price differentials and infant mor-
tality. We conducted an ecological analysis precluding indi-
vidual level inference. Although we used fixed-effects models
and adjusted for key covariates, the use of NUTS-2 regions as
our unit of analysis means that we cannot rule out the possi-
bility of residual confounding and that ecological fallacy may
be an issue. Including the price differential, rather than mini-
mum price, in our model makes our findings applicable and
easier to interpret in settings with different levels of cigarette
prices;itisabettermarkerofopportunitiesforsmokerstoswitch
to less expensive cigarettes, which is especially relevant in the
context of rising prices. Sociodemographic or infant mortality
data were missing for some regions and years, and price data
wereunavailablefor5EUcountries,butweincluded96%oftotal
live births in the 23 countries assessed in our analysis. No data

understanding of the likely causal pathways.
Conclusions
Higher median cigarette prices were associated with reduced
infant mortality, while cigarette price differentials were asso-
ciated with higher infant mortality in the EU. Combined with
other evidence, this research suggests that legislators should
implement tobacco tax and price control measures that elimi-
nate budget cigarettes.
