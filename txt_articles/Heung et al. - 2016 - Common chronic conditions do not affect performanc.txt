ABSTRACT
Background. Identification of acute kidney injury (AKI) can be
challenging in patients with underlying chronic disease, and
biomarkers often perform poorly in this population. In this
study we examined the performance characteristics of the
novel biomarker panel of urinary tissue inhibitor of metallo-
proteinases-2 (TIMP2) and insulin-like growth factor-binding
protein 7 ([IGFBP7]) in patients with a variety of comorbid
conditions.
Methods. We analyzed data from two multicenter studies of
critically ill patients in which [TIMP2]•[IGFBP7] was validated
for prediction of Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes
(KDIGO) Stage 2 or 3 AKI within 12 h. We constructed receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curves for AKI prediction both
overall and by comorbid conditions common among patients
with AKI, including diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure
(CHF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
Results. In the overall cohort of 1131 patients, 139 (12.3%) de-
veloped KDIGO Stage 2 or 3 AKI. [TIMP2]•[IGFBP7] was sig-
nificantly higher in AKI versus non-AKI patients, both overall
and within each comorbidity subgroup. The AUC for [TIMP2]•
[IGFBP7] in predicting AKI was 0.81 overall. Higher AUC
was noted in patients with versus without CHF (0.89 versus
0.79; P = 0.026) and CKD (0.91 versus 0.80; P = 0.024).
Conclusions. We observed no significant impairment in the
performance of cell cycle arrest biomarkers due to the presence
of chronic comorbid conditions.

INTRODUCTION
Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in up to 20% of hospitalized
patients and is associated with high morbidity and mortality
[1–4]. Although management of patients with AKI remains
largely supportive, limiting further renal damage when injury
occurs is an important goal [5], and it logically follows that

 early diagnosis and recognition of AKI may provide the best op-
portunity to attenuate ongoing injury. The ability to accurately
identify patients at risk for AKI could inform clinical decision-
making, such as through emphasizing resuscitation, more strin-
gent avoidance of nephrotoxic exposures and more attention to
appropriate medication dosing. Thus, an important goal of AKI
research has been to develop biomarkers to accurately identify
the onset of renal injury or predict AKI risk earlier than current
methods allow. However, AKI biomarkers may have variable
performance in the setting of comorbid disease. For example,
a recent study demonstrated markedly inferior test characteris-
tics for six biomarkers in AKI patients with pre-existing chronic
kidney disease (CKD) [6]. This is particularly problematic, as
CKD is a well-recognized risk factor for AKI [7].
We recently reported datafrom two multicenter studies of crit-
ically ill patients (the Sapphire and Topaz studies) where a panel
consisting of urinary tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2
(TIMP2) and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7
(IGFBP7), both markers associated with cell cycle arrest, was va-
lidated for risk stratification for moderate–severe AKI [8, 9]. Urin-
ary [TIMP2]•[IGFBP7] >0.3 (ng/mL)2/1000 had >90% sensitivity
in predicting the development of moderate–severe AKI within 12
h [9]. In contrast to other novel AKI biomarkers that reflect renal
cell injury or decline in renal function, these markers are believed
to reflect the renal tubular epithelial response to cellular stress
from injury [10, 11]. [TIMP2]•[IGFBP7] was found to have su-
perior performance characteristics for AKI risk stratification, as
assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristics
(ROC) curve (AUC), compared with other markers such as neu-
trophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), kidney injury
molecule 1 (KIM-1), cystatin C and interleukin-18 (IL-18) [8].
However, although patients with CKD and other chronic condi-
tions were enrolled in these trials, we have not previouslyanalyzed
test performance when restricted to these patients.
Here we pool data from two trials of critically ill subjects at
high risk for AKI [8, 9] and examine the impact of various co-
morbidities [e.g. CKD, congestive heart failure (CHF)] on the
performance characteristics of cell cycle arrest markers for the
prediction of moderate–severe [Kidney Disease: Improving
Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Stage 2 or 3] AKI in critically ill
patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient population
We conducted a secondary analysis of data collected from two
multicenter clinical trials used to validate [TIMP2]•[IGFBP7] in
AKI, the Sapphire and Topaz studies [8, 9]. The Sapphire study
enrolled 744 critically ill adult (>21 years) patients who were at
risk for development of AKI. In the Topaz study, 420 critically
ill adult patients were enrolled, with similar inclusion/exclusion
criteria to the Sapphire study. Specifically, subjects in both studies
were required to have evidence of significant pulmonary [respira-
tory Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score ≥2] or
cardiovascular (cardiac SOFA score ≥1) dysfunction and could
not yet have met criteria for moderate–severe AKI (KDIGO
Stage 2 or 3). Patient recruitment occurred within 24 h of
intensive care unit (ICU) admission. More detailed descriptions
of both studies have previously been published [8, 9]. Both the
Sapphire and Topaz studies were approved by the Western Insti-
tutional Review Board (Olympia, WA, USA) as well as individual
site investigational review boardsif required and written informed
consent was obtained from all subjects (or their legally authorized
representatives).
Data collection
Clinical data collection included patient demographics, rea-
son for ICU admission, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health
Evaluation (APACHE) III score variables, hourly urine output
and laboratory testing results. Comorbid conditions were deter-
mined based on review of available medical records and based
on diagnostic codes. Estimated glomerular filtration rate
(eGFR) was determined using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epi-
demiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation; patients with
missing or unknown race were considered not to be black.
Each site extracted data from clinical sources and input the
data into an online electronic case report form in a deidentified
password-protected dataset. Study data were stored at an inde-
pendent server site (Medidata Solutions, New York, NY, USA).
The primary outcome was moderate–severe AKI as defined
by KDIGO criteria for Stage 2 or 3 AKI developing within 12 h
of enrollment. In the Topaz study, final determination of AKI
was adjudicated by an expert panel of three independent ne-
phrologists who were blinded to biomarker results.
Laboratory testing
Urine and blood samples were collected and processed using
standard methods. Sample supernatants were frozen within 2 h
of collection and stored at −70°C before batch transport to a
central lab for analysis. Samples were thawed immediately be-
fore analysis. Testing for [TIMP2]•[IGFBP7] was performed
using a clinical immunoassay (NEPHROCHECK Test and
ASTUTE140 Meter; Astute Medical, San Diego, CA, USA),
and lab technicians performing the testing were blinded to pa-
tient outcomes. For subjects recruited in the Sapphire study,
[TIMP2]•[IGFBP7] testing was performed at Astute Medical
laboratories; in the Topaz study, testing was performed in trip-
licate at three independent laboratories (University of Califor-
nia at San Diego, San Diego, CA, USA; University of Louisville,
Louisville, KY, USA; and ARUP Laboratories, Salt Lake City,
UT, USA). Test results for [TIMP2]•[IGFBP7] are uniformly
reported in units of (ng/mL)2/1000 throughout the text.
Statistical methods
Continuous variables were compared between AKI groups
using the Wilcoxon rank sum test or t-test. Categorical variables
were compared between AKI groups using the χ2 test. To assess
the effect of comorbidity on levels of [TIMP2]•[IGFBP7], we
performed multiple linear regression analysis for each co-
morbidity where the response variable is rank transformed
[TIMP2]•[IGFBP7]; the explanatory variables are AKI status,
comorbidity status and the interaction between them. AUC cal-
culation and testing for differences in two AUCs were based on
the Delong method, using the R package ‘pROC’ [12]. When
necessary, P-values were adjusted for multiple testing by the

 Benjamini–Hochberg method. A multivariate logistic regression
model was constructed to predict the primary outcome of AKI
accounting for comorbid conditions. Backward selection was
used to eliminate variables with P-values <0.10 and arrive at the
final model. Statistical analyses were performed using R version
3.1.0. (R Foundation, http://www.r-project.org/) and SAS 9.3
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
RESULTS
Patient characteristics
Figure 1 shows the flow of patient recruitment from both the
Sapphire and Topaz studies. A total of 1164 patients were re-
cruited; in the Sapphire study, 21 (2.8%) patients were excluded
after enrollment, while 12 (2.9%) patients were excluded in the
Topaz study. Patient characteristics were similar between the
two studies, as reported previously [13]. The final cohort con-
sisted of 1131 patients, of whom 139 (12.3%) developed moder-
ate–severe AKI (KDIGO Stage 2 or 3) [5]. For simplicity,
throughout the manuscript AKI refers to KDIGO Stage 2 or 3
AKI, while no AKI indicates either no AKI or Stage 1 AKI.
Patient characteristics stratified by AKI status are shown in
Table 1. A greater percentage of patients who developed AKI
had preexisting diabetes and hypertension compared with pa-
tients without AKI. The percentage of patients with underlying
CKD was similar between AKI groups, but median enrollment
serum creatinine was higher in patients who developed AKI.
[TIMP2]•[IGFBP7] performance
In the overall cohort, median [TIMP2]•[IGFBP7] was
significantly higher in AKI patients compared with non-AKI
patients {1.5 [interquartile range (IQR) 0.6–2.8] versus 0.3
[IQR 0.1–0.7]; P < 0.001}. These values were consistent across
a variety of comorbid states and remained statistically different
between AKI and non-AKI patients (Figure 2).
In the cohort of 97 patients with CKD, the AUC for [TIMP2]
•[IGFBP7] prediction of moderate–severe AKI was 0.91 (95%
CI 0.85–0.97) (Figure 3). The relative risk for AKI with a
[TIMP2]•[IGFBP7] value above the previously validated cutoff
of 0.3 was 32.4 (95% CI 3.7–284.8). There were 326 patients
with diabetes mellitus in the overall study cohort. [TIMP2]•
[IGFBP7] testing yielded an AUC of 0.83 (95% CI 0.77–0.89)
(Figure 4), and a value >0.3 was associated with a relative risk
for moderate–severe AKI of 12.8 (95% CI 4.1–40.1). In recog-
nition of the overlap between the CKD and diabetic patient po-
pulations, a sensitivity analysis was performed focusing on
patients with either CKD or diabetes alone. For patients with
diabetes and not CKD (n = 273), the AUC was 0.82 (95% CI
0.75–0.88). In those with CKD but not diabetes (n = 47), the
AUC was 0.95 (95% CI 0.86–1.00).
To further assess the impact of comorbidity on [TIMP2]•
[IGFBP7], multiple linear regression models were performed
with [TIMP2]•[IGFBP7] as a function of comorbidities, ad-
justed for AKI status. CKD was found to have a statistically sig-
nificant effect on [TIMP2]•[IGFBP7] in non-AKI patients
(P = 0.009) but not in AKI patients. Notably, in non-AKI pa-
tients, the direction of effect was such that the presence of
CKD was associated with lower [TIMP2]•[IGFBP7]. The inter-
actions between each comorbidity and AKI status were not
significant.
To examine the predictive ability of [TIMP2]•[IGFBP7] in
different comorbid states, a multivariate logistic regression
model for AKI was developed that included all comorbid states
and their interaction terms with [TIMP2]•[IGFBP7] (as well as
age, race, sex, body mass index, enrollment creatinine and non-
renal SOFA score). Overall, [TIMP2]•[IGFBP7] remained a sig-
nificant predictor for AKI at 12 h [OR 5.0 (95% CI 2.8–8.8) per
unit increase in log10([TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7])]. ROC curves were

 created for subpopulations stratified by each comorbid condi-
tion, and the resultant AUC values are shown in Figure 5.
The majority of AUC values remained >0.80 and did not differ
statistically between patients with and without coronary artery
disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), diabetes or hypertension. [TIMP2]•[IGFBP7] in pa-
tients with CHF had a significantly higher AUC compared
with those without CHF (0.89 versus 0.79; P = 0.026), and a
similar relationship was seen with [TIMP2]•[IGFBP7] in
CKD versus non-CKD patients (0.91 versus 0.80; P = 0.024).
The sensitivity and specificity of [TIMP2]•[IGFBP7] at both
the 0.3 and 2.0 cutoffs were examined by comorbidity
subgroup, and values are presented in Table 2. There was no sig-
nificant difference in sensitivity or specificity across all sub-
groups for either cutoff.
DISCUSSION
Cell cycle arrest markers have recently emerged as important
tools to predict moderate–severe AKI. In this study, we
explored the impact of comorbidity on the performance char-
acteristics of these biomarkers. Overall, the biomarkers per-
formed equally well in distinguishing AKI from non-AKI in

 with various comorbidities (e.g. CKD, diabetes, CHF) are
among the highest risk for developing AKI, and therefore dem-
onstration of the utility of a biomarker in these populations is
important. Second, previous AKI biomarker studies have re-
ported variable performance in different clinical settings, and
some of that variation may be attributable to patient comorbid-
ity characteristics. Cell cycle arrest markers could theoretically
be elevated due to a variety of stress states and not specifically in
response to AKI. Understanding the limitations of biomarkers
in different patient populations is critical to their appropriate
application to the clinical setting. Indeed, a recent editorial con-
cluded that ‘unscrutinized use of these [novel AKI] biomarkers
may distract from adequate clinical evaluation and carries the
risk of worse instead of better patient outcome’ [14].
Prior studies of other novel AKI biomarkers have speci-
fically noted the influence of baseline renal impairment on
diagnostic characteristics. Endre et al. [6] examined several bio-
markers, including NGAL, IL-18 and KIM-1, in a prospective
study of 529 ICU patients. They found that biomarker perform-
ance depended on baseline renal function as well as the amount
of time after the renal insult, with AUC values for AKI diagno-
sis at 6–12 h ranging from 0.69–0.72 in patients without CKD
(eGFR ≥60 mL/min) to only 0.39–0.61 in patients with CKD
[6]. Koyner et al. [15] also reported differences in AKI biomark-
er performance when stratifying by the presence of CKD, con-
cluding that urinary NGAL and KIM-1 ‘did not display the
ability to predict future development of AKI in those with an
eGFR <60 mL/min’. Other studies have shown that NGAL

 levels rise with decreasing eGFR in the absence of AKI [16, 17].
Similarly, KIM-1 levels are elevated in many different types of
kidney disease other than AKI and appear correlated to chronic
inflammation and fibrosis [18]. While initially identified as AKI
biomarkers, both NGAL and KIM-1 are now also being ex-
plored as markers for CKD and CKD progression [17, 19,
20]. Not surprisingly, a workgroup from the Acute Dialysis
Quality Initiative has identified biomarker performance in pa-
tients with normal versus abnormal renal function as an im-
portant area for research needed to bring biomarkers closer
to clinical utility [21].
In this study, the AUC of [TIMP2]•[IGFBP7] was signifi-
cantly greater in patients with CKD compared with those with-
out CKD. While these results are encouraging, it should be
noted that there were a limited number of CKD patients in
the overall cohort, and only 13 CKD patients developed AKI.
Nevertheless, several theoretical explanations exist for why
cell cycle arrest markers for AKI may have better diagnostic per-
formance in CKD patients compared with other biomarkers.
Patients with CKD have less renal reserve and may be more sus-
ceptible to insults and/or more likely to overtly manifest injury
compared with patients with intact renal function, where sub-
clinical injury can occur. Indeed, recent studies have established
the concept of subclinical AKI whereby renal injury has oc-
curred (biomarker positive), but in the absence of a significant
increase in creatinine (creatinine criteria negative) [22], CKD
patients may be less likely to fall into this gray zone and have
‘false positive’ results with biomarkers. Another consideration
is that cell cycle arrest markers may be a more specific response
to renal injury than the release of other biomarkers, which may
reflect more chronic processes such as inflammation and fibro-
sis. Part of the clinical challenge with respect to AKI is that a
renal signal follows a variety of discordant insults to the kidney,
including sepsis, toxicity and muscle damage to name but a few.
Thus the suggestion that the expression of markers of cell cycle
arrest represents a uniform response to a heterogeneous insult
is enticing.
Diabetes mellitus is another important risk factor for AKI
and therefore another important population in which to evalu-
ate AKI biomarkers. As with CKD, previous AKI biomarker
studies have had variable results in diabetic patients. Ahmed
and Hamed [23] recently evaluated urinary KIM-1 levels in dia-
betic patients without AKI. Compared with healthy controls,
male diabetics had greater than five times the levels of KIM-1;
in females, the difference was >10-fold. Sabbisetti et al. [24]
note that KIM-1 levels were elevated in post-cardiac surgery
diabetic patients without AKI compared with controls, al-
though not to the same degree as patients that did develop
AKI. In our study, [TIMP2]•[IGFBP7] performance was fairly
constant in the diabetic versus non-diabetic populations, with
AUC values ranging from 0.80 to 0.83. Our findings suggest
that the performance of cell cycle arrest markers is not compro-
mised in patients with diabetes.
Some limitations of this study are worth noting. As a post
hoc analysis, the original study data were not powered to exam-
ine biomarker performance in subpopulations. Despite pool-
ing, the subpopulations of interest remained relatively small
(e.g. 97 patients with CKD), and these findings are not
definitive evidence of equivalent performance, although they
represent the largest cohort currently available for study. Our
results would be strengthened by confirmation in larger, pro-
spective studies. In addition, we did not have albuminuria
data for the majority of patients and therefore cannot speculate
as to whether biomarker performance might be affected by the
presence of albuminuria.
In summary, we examined the performance of cell cycle ar-
rest biomarkers for moderate to severe AKI in patients with
various common comorbid conditions. In patients with dia-
betes, who are at elevated risk for AKI, we found no significant
decrease in the ability of urinary [TIMP2]•[IGFBP7] to predict
AKI risk. In a small cohort of CKD patients, another high-risk
group for AKI, the biomarker panel showed superior AUCs
compared with non-CKD patients. Thus, our results suggest
no significant impairment in the performance of cell cycle ar-
rest biomarkers due to chronic comorbid conditions.
