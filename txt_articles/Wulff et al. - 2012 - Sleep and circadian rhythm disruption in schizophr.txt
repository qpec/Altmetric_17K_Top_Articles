 Disturbances of sleep and abnormal sleep–wake cycles are
common features of psychiatric disorders.1 In schizophrenia,
polysomnographic studies comparing healthy individuals with
participants who are drug-naive or drug-treated, when either
acutely psychotic or clinically stable, have found delayed sleep
onset, impaired sleep continuity and increased time awake.2–5
There are also sleep architectural changes already evident in
individuals not on medication at psychosis onset, characterised
by shorter rapid eye movement sleep and less slow-wave sleep.6
Slow-wave sleep deficits have been shown to correlate with lower
frontal lobe metabolism and ventriculomegaly suggesting a
neurodevelopmental trait.7,8 Sleep is only part of the 24 h circadian
cycle. The generation and regulation of sleep that arises from
multiple brain regions, neurotransmitter systems and modulatory
hormones is driven by a complex interaction of wake and sleep
mechanisms involving: (a) a wake-dependant homeostatic build-
up of sleep pressure that increases with prolonged wakefulness
and dissipates during sleep; and (b) a 24 h body clock or circadian
system (‘circa diem’ – about a day) that aligns sleep to the dark
phase and activity to the light phase of the 24 h day through
precisely controlled, cyclic expression of a number of genes,
so-called clock genes. It has recently been shown that genetic
variability in a number of these genes is associated not only with
phenotypic differences in morning v. evening preference, rhythm-
related
sleep
disorders,
sleep
homeostasis
and
cognitive
performance following sleep loss9 but also with midbrain dopamine
regulation and reward processing10 known to be disrupted in schizo-
phrenia.11 These findings suggest that sleep–wake disruption in
schizophrenia may have a genetic basis and that the presence of
specific sleep–wake patterns may serve as a useful endophenotypic
dimension to assess familial pre-disposition.12
To date there have been few studies of circadian rhythms over
extended periods of time in people with schizophrenia and these
are mainly case reports or small group reports; none has
controlled for the possibility that a lack of structured routine,
common
in
schizophrenia,
may
be
a
cause
of
circadian
misalignment in sleep–wake activity. The main aim of this study
was to provide a comprehensive description of sleep–wake
phenotypes in individuals with stable, non-acute schizophrenia
who have sleep complaints, and to determine the contribution
of probable circadian rhythm dysfunction to self-reported sleep
disturbances. We measured day-to-day motor activity and light
exposure with unobtrusive ‘watches’ (wrist actigraphy) over
6 weeks, and we established melatonin profiles from weekly urine
collections, thereby using melatonin’s property as a physiological
phase marker of the circadian clock. To control for the non-
specific effect that the lack of a daytime routine may have on
sleep–wake cycles, we compared the circadian rhythms of
participants with schizophrenia with those of unemployed,
healthy individuals.
Method
Participants
Twenty people with schizophrenia and on medication were
recruited from mental health services in west London (the
schizophrenia
group).
The
diagnosis
of
schizophrenia was
confirmed for each patient according to DSM-IV13 criteria by using
OPCRIT14 with reference to longitudinal information from the
clinical notes. This group was compared with 21 healthy people
who were all unemployed and recruited from the same catchment
area via the local job centre (the control group). General physical
and psychological health was confirmed with our health question-
naire adapted from the Patient Health Questionnaire.15
Exclusion criteria for the control group were: a history of
psychiatric illness in themselves or their first-degree relatives
and being prescribed medication known to affect sleep. Exclusion
criteria for all participants were: a previous
head injury,
neurological illness or an endocrine disorder affecting brain
function, drug or alcohol dependence and visual impairment

Sleep and circadian rhythm disruption
in schizophrenia{
Katharina Wulff, Derk-Jan Dijk, Benita Middleton, Russell G. Foster and Eileen M. Joyce
Background
Sleep disturbances comparable with insomnia occur in up to
80% of people with schizophrenia, but very little is known
about the contribution of circadian coordination to these
prevalent disruptions.
Aims
A systematic exploration of circadian time patterns in
individuals with schizophrenia with recurrent sleep disruption.
Method
We examined the relationship between sleep–wake activity,
recorded actigraphically over 6 weeks, along with ambient
light exposure and simultaneous circadian clock timing, by
collecting weekly 48 h profiles of a urinary metabolite of
melatonin in 20 out-patients with schizophrenia and 21
healthy control individuals matched for age, gender and
being unemployed.
Results
Significant sleep/circadian disruption occurred in all the
participants with schizophrenia. Half these individuals
showed severe circadian misalignment ranging from
phase-advance/delay to non-24 h periods in sleep–wake
and melatonin cycles, and the other half showed
patterns from excessive sleep to highly irregular and
fragmented sleep epochs but with normally timed
melatonin production.
Conclusions
Severe circadian sleep/wake disruptions exist despite stability
in mood, mental state and newer antipsychotic treatment.
They cannot be explained by the individuals’ level of
everyday function.

 (assessed using a Snellen chart). The study protocol was approved
by the West London Mental Health Trust Local Research Ethics
Committee. Participation of one individual was approved by the
Lothian Local Research Ethics Committee. All participants gave
written informed consent and received an honorarium for their
time.
Clinical assessments
Subjective
sleep
quality
was
assessed
using
the
self-rated
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI),16 which measures sleep
quality over the previous month according to seven subscale
domains: sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep
efficiency, sleep disturbance, use of sleeping medication, and
daytime dysfunction. The range of subscale scores is 0–3 and
the sum of all seven domains yields a global score of subjective
sleep quality (range 0–21) with higher scores representing poorer
subjective sleep quality. Studies examining the psychometric
properties of the PSQI have found it appropriate for use with
healthy volunteers and patients.17,18
Individual differences in diurnal preference of activities were
estimated using a self-assessment questionnaire that distinguishes
morning, evening and intermediate types.19 This questionnaire
has been shown to provide a reliable measure of the so-called
‘chronotype’
. For example, the best time of day for performance
of an evening type is shifted towards the later hours of the day
in comparison to a morning type.
Mood was assessed with the Profile of Mood States (POMS).20
This is a self-report questionnaire assessing emotion over the
previous week and comprises 65 items corresponding to six
factors: tension–anxiety, depression–dejection, anger–hostility,
vigour–activity, fatigue and confusion. This was undertaken by
10 individuals in the schizophrenia group and 11 in the control
group at the beginning and end of the 6-week recording period.
The participants in the schizophrenia group were in a clinically
stable state according to the referring team and their medication had
been unchanged for at least 3 months. They all reported some form
of regular social activity during the 6-week observation period.
Using self-report and the clinical notes, information concerning
activities of daily living and social activity was compiled for
participants in the schizophrenia group and rated using the
General Assessment of Function (GAF) scale.21 The persistent
presence or absence of positive symptoms was also noted.
Sleep–wake monitoring
The sleep–wake cycle of each participant and exposure to light was
simultaneously monitored for a period of 6 weeks using wrist-
worn actigraphs with an integrated light sensor (Actiwatch-L).
Any intrinsic variability among the watches was addressed by
ensuring that the same watch was used equally by both groups.
Actigraphs contain a miniaturised piezoelectric acceleration sensor
that
detects
the
movement-induced
force
and
stores
this
information in a memory chip. Data were collected in the
actigraph’s integration mode, which allowed sampling with a
frequency of 32 Hz and storage of activity counts for each 2 min
epoch. Ambient light of the bedroom was recorded separately by
placing a second Actiwatch-L next to the participant’s bed because
light levels can be missed by the wrist-worn watch if it is covered
when the participant is asleep. Each participant was asked to keep
a daily record of bedtime, get-up time, naps, daytime activities
and medication in a standardised diary for the duration of
actigraphic monitoring. Participants were asked to provide very
detailed contextual information for 2 consecutive days during
their first week, which was used as real-time ‘bio-calibration’
record for the interpretation of individual actigraphic activity
levels over the remaining 5 weeks. The consistency and accuracy
of diary entries was monitored as part of the weekly home visits
and included the engagement of the participant in the onscreen
inspection of actigraphic light/activity data and their verification
with diary notes.
Melatonin rhythms
To estimate the circadian period and phase of the participants’
circadian
pacemaker,
we
established
weekly
profiles
of
6-sulphatoxymelatonin (aMT6s, a metabolite of melatonin) using
a protocol suitable
for people
with
schizophrenia.22
Each
participant was asked to pass a full volume of urine into a bottle
roughly every 4 h (about 8 h when asleep) over a 48 h period and
note the date and time of collection. The volume in each bottle
was recorded and two 5 ml aliquots of each sample were stored
at 7208C. Two participants in the schizophrenia group were
instructed to discontinue the collection for 1–2 weeks due to
unavoidable circumstances. Three participants in this group
collected urine specimens only infrequently and the melatonin
sulphate
profiles
of
these
three
individuals
could
not
be
determined with certainty and were discarded. In total 17 people
in the schizophrenia group and 21 in the control group completed
repeated urine collection that was used to investigate the amount,
timing and periodicity of melatonin sulphate.
Data analysis
Activity and light data from Actiwatches were downloaded to a
computer and actograms showing the rest–activity and light pat-
terns were generated and analysed with ‘Actiwatch Activity and
Sleep Analysis’ software (Actiwatch software version 5, Cambridge
Neurotechnology, UK; www.camntech.com/files/The_Actiwatch_
User_Manual_V7.2.pdf) on Windows. Diary information was
then added manually to the printed actograms to verify the
concordance with the actigraphic data, to determine ‘bedtime’
and ‘get-up time’ and to edit gaps when the watch was removed,
for example to avoid water when swimming, showering or
bathing. Weekly onscreen inspection of activity data, lights on/
off and diary entries allowed precise determination of bedtime
and get-up time. Sleep start and sleep end was not manually
determined but automatically calculated by the ‘SleepWatch’
algorithm using bedtime and get-up time as reference points.
Periodogram analysis and cosinor analysis was carried out
across 6 weeks of rest–activity data with the software El Temps
(A. Diez-Noguera, University of Barcelona, Spain; www.el-temps.
com/contact.htm) to determine period length and peak of the rest–
activity cycles respectively. Non-parametric circadian rhythms
analysis23 was carried out on complete continuous days and
weighted averages were carried out for split periods when days
with incomplete data were excluded. We generated ‘average 24 h
day’ profiles of activity for each week by overlaying 7 days from
midnight to midnight. A 10 h window (M10) and another 5 h
window (L5), both moving in 1 h steps across the ‘average day’
,
were used to determine the periods of the 10 most active hours
and the 5 least active hours. The amplitude was calculated from
the ratio of the most active 10 h period to the least active 5 h
period across the averaged 24 h profile. Its measure ranges from
0 to 1 with higher values indicating a high amplitude hence
consolidated low activity during sleep (L5) and consolidated high
activity during the day (M10), which is considered healthy in
individuals.
The automated algorithm of the Actiwatch software was used
to establish ‘sleep onset’ and ‘sleep offset’ for each night and to
calculate sleep/wake estimates. Sleep estimates, derived from the
actigraphic sleep analysis, include ‘sleep period’ (time between
309
Sleep and circadian rhythm disruption in schizophrenia
 Wulff et al
sleep onset and sleep offset, including periods defined as ‘wake
time’), ‘total sleep time’ (TST, time between sleep onset and sleep
offset, excluding periods defined as ‘wake time’), ‘sleep latency’
(defined as time between ‘bedtime’ and ‘sleep onset’) and ‘sleep
efficiency’ (defined as percentage of time spent asleep between
‘sleep onset’ and ‘sleep offset’
, thereby separating it from ‘sleep
latency’). Sleep/wake estimates were averaged weekly over the
entire recording period. Days with missing data of several hours
(for example when the participant forgot the Actiwatch or for
unexpected circumstances such as admission to hospital for a
surgical procedure) were excluded from further analysis.
Actograms were also visually inspected to estimate the daily
pattern of light exposure. Our simultaneous recordings of rest–
activity and light exposure showed that light exposure remained
synchronised with the activity period and dark with the sleep period.
To investigate the diversity in sleep–wake timing using long-
term objective recordings, we developed operational criteria to
distinguish the following abnormal sleep patterns in accordance
with DSM-IV and ICD-1024 diagnostic guidelines: (a) non-shifted
sleep/wake phases, defined as sleep onset before 01.00 h and open
sleep end; (b) delayed sleep/wake phases, defined as sleep onset
after 01.00 h and sleep end after 10.00 h; (c) non-24 h sleep/wake
phases, defined as circadian period longer or shorter than 24 h;
(d) irregular/fragmented sleep/wake patterns, defined as sleep and
wake episodes at irregular times over 24h; (e) hypersomnia, defined
as the majority of consolidated sleep periods 49 h regardless of their
sleep onset time. Mixed pattern types can be exhibited.
Melatonin sulphate concentrations were determined for each
urine sample by radioimmunoassay.25 To determine rhythms in
melatonin sulphate from our unequally spaced collection times,
we applied a non-linear regression model to our data using the
equation:
MT = c + (Amp6cos(2p6((t 7 tc)/T))),
where MT represents the aMT6s secretion rate (ng/h) and t
represents time. For the parameter estimates c represents mesor
(rhythm adjusted daily mean); Amp amplitude; tc phase angle;
and T period. The timing of melatonin sulphate peaks were
estimated at each 48 h session and these data points were
subsequently
fitted
to
a
curve.
Non-linear
regression was
performed using SAS software for Windows, Version 8.
To estimate the dose of antipsychotic medication across the
various types and applications (for example oral or long-acting
injections) of antipsychotics, we converted each participant’s dose
of antipsychotic medication into a chlorpromazine equivalent dose
using chlorpromazine 100 mg/day. Dose equivalency estimates were
taken from published tables,26–28 with equivalents being based
primarily on dopaminergic blockade and not on a drug receptor
profile for cholinergic, serotonergic or histaminergic systems because
clinical potency of antipsychotic medication has been shown to
correlate closely with affinity for dopamine D2 receptors.
Statistical analysis
Data analysis comparing two groups was based on t-tests for
independent variables. Data analysis comparing three groups
was based on one-way analysis of variance with post hoc Tukey’s
test (homogeneous variances) or Dunnett’s test (inhomogeneous
variances) to explore significant effects. For categorical variables,
chi-squared analyses were conducted. For the schizophrenia
group, univariate ANCOVAs were used to determine the influence
of three factors: (a) presence of positive symptoms, (b) length of
illness, and (c) GAF on sleep, rest–activity and melatonin rhythm
parameters
(dependant
variables).
The
participants
with
schizophrenia were categorised into two groups, for each of these
analyses: with/without positive symptoms, below/above 10 years
of illness duration (median split) and below/above a GAF score
of 50 (median split). Age was included as a covariate to adjust
the scores on dependent variables of the ANCOVA before those
scores were related to any independent groups. Main effects of
‘group’ and of ‘age’ as well as the interaction of ‘group6age’ were
included in the model. Non-parametric correlation was based on
Spearman’s rank correlation. Statistical analyses were performed
with SPSS 16 for Windows.
Results
Participants
Table 1 shows that there were no differences between the
schizophrenia and the control group with respect to: gender;
age; chronotype; mood state across the study period; and season
when tested. The schizophrenia group reported poor sleep as
assessed by the PSQI.
Schizophrenia group
No
one
in
the
schizophrenia
group
was
in
remunerated
employment. Seventeen individuals lived with a family member
or independently, two lived in supported accommodation and
one was in an in-patient unit, ready for discharge but awaiting
accommodation. They all had paranoid subtype schizophrenia.
Regarding regularly prescribed psychotropic medication and
psychiatric comorbidity, 12 individuals were taking antipsychotic
drugs only, and 7 received additional psychotropic medication to
control extrapyramidal (antimuscarinics
n = 3) and seizure-
inducing side-effects of antipsychotics (anticonvulsants n = 4).
Eight people had experienced depressive and/or anxiety symptoms
at some point during their illness; two of these were currently
being treated with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
Antipsychotic medication ranked by dose using chlorpromazine
equivalents is detailed in online Table DS1 along with age, gender
and presence/absence of positive symptoms. Length of illness
ranged from 2 to 33 years (median 10 years). Sleep, rest–activity
and melatonin rhythm parameters were similar for individuals
with shorter (below 10 years) and longer (above 10 years)
durations of illness (all P40.1; online Table DS2). Their GAF
scores ranged from 34 to 70 (median 50). Sleep, rest–activity
and melatonin rhythm parameters were similar for individuals
with scores below and above 50 (all P40.1; online Table
DS3). None of the sleep, rest–activity and melatonin rhythm
parameters were correlated with antipsychotic drug dose using
chlorpromazine equivalents (all P40.05; online Table DS4).
Persistent positive symptoms were present in eight individuals.
Univariate ANCOVAs comparing groups with and without
positive symptoms showed no significant differences for sleep
parameters, rest–activity and chlorpromazine equivalents of
antipsychotic
dose
(all
P40.1;
online
Table
DS5).
Lower
melatonin levels (mesor) were found in individuals with positive
symptoms
(mean
467.6 ng
(s.d. = 228.6))
compared
with
individuals
without
positive
symptoms
(mean
1066.3 ng
(s.d.= 501)) (group: F(1,15)= 9.207, P= 0.01). However, individuals
with positive symptoms and lower melatonin levels were also
older (group age interaction: F(1,15) = 5.029, P= 0.045). Melatonin
levels were correlated with the age of participants (n = 17,
Spearman’s rho: 70.513, P= 0.035), with older individuals having
lower and younger individuals having higher melatonin levels,
indicating that differences in melatonin levels between individuals
with and without positive symptoms was an effect of age.
Timing of sleep–wake behaviour
The variability of sleep–wake timing was remarkably greater in
the schizophrenia group than in the control group (Fig. 1).
310
 Sleep and circadian rhythm disruption in schizophrenia
Intra-individual difference in sleep onset, sleep offset and sleep
mid-point in the schizophrenia group was two- to threefold that
of the variability in the control group (Table 2).
The time between sleep start and sleep end (sleep period), the
actual time spent asleep (total sleep time) and sleep latency (time
between bedtime and sleep onset) was each significantly longer in
the schizophrenia group than the control group (P50.005;
Table 2). Thus, individuals with schizophrenia were inconsistent
in their sleep patterns but, in general, took longer to fall asleep,
spent a longer time in bed and actually slept longer than those
in the control group.
Further inspection of the sleep/wake timing of the schizophrenia
group suggested two characteristic profiles. Whereas the majority of
individuals in the control group had a sleep onset after 01.00 h
and sleep offset before 10.00 h, in half those in the schizophrenia
group (n = 10), sleep onset was before 01.00 h and sleep offset
before 12.00 h (subgroup I), and in the other half (n = 10) sleep
onset was after 01.00 h and sleep offset after 12.00 h (subgroup
II) (Fig. 2). An ANOVA of these three groups (controls,
schizophrenia subgroup I, schizophrenia subgroup II) confirmed

Distribution of sleep timing with sleep onset plotted

Each dot represents a person’s average sleep onset/offset time derived from 6 weeks

schizophrenia subgroup II: sleep onset after 01.00 h, n = 10; control group n = 21.
 Wulff et al
distinct differences in sleep timing and sleep duration (Table 3).
Post hoc comparisons revealed that sleep onset was significantly
different between all groups (P50.001), with the control group
in the middle and the two schizophrenia subgroups either side
(Table 3): schizophrenia subgroup I showed earliest sleep onset
and subgroup II showed the latest sleep onset relative to local time.
Sleep end was significantly later in subgroup II in comparison with
both subgroup I (P50.001) and the control group (P50.001)
(Table 3).
Other sleep/wake characteristics differed in these groups
(Fig. 3). All individuals in the control group displayed consistent
sleep
patterns
of
either
consolidated
sleep/activity
phases
synchronised to the day/night cycle (n = 5, example in Fig. 3(a)),
consolidated sleep phases with delayed sleep onsets (n= 11, example
in Fig. 3(b)) or less consolidated and fragmented sleep phases
(n = 5, example in Fig. 3(c)). In contrast, the schizophrenia
group’s rest/activity patterns were mostly abnormal (n = 17).
Within subgroup I (i.e. those with a sleep onset before 01.00 h,
70% male), five people showed excessive sleep periods (Fig.
3(d)) and five irregular and/or fragmented sleep/activity phases
(Fig. 3(e) and (f)). Within subgroup II (i.e. with a sleep onset after
01.00 h and a sleep end after 10.00 h, 80% male), six people
showed markedly delayed sleep phases (Fig. 3(g)) and four people
exhibited patterns of both delayed and non-24 h (free-running)
sleep/activity phases (Fig. 3(h) and (i)).
Thus, in addition to those in the schizophrenia group taking
longer to fall asleep and sleeping for longer than those in the
control group regardless of sleep onset time, the sleep phase in
50% of individuals in the schizophrenia group was out of
synchrony with the environmental night-time.
A similar analysis of the circadian phase of the rest/activity
rhythm showed that the shift in sleep/wake timing of schizo-
phrenia subgroup II was also reflected in a later afternoon activity
peak compared with earlier peaks in both subgroup I and the
control group (P = 0.002) (Table 4). However, those in subgroup
II were overall significantly less active during waking hours in

comparison with controls (P50.001). The level of activity of
individuals in schizophrenia subgroup I was intermediate between
the other two groups (P = 0.678).
Despite marked differences in sleep onset and sleep end times,
most participants had sleep/wake cycles with a near-24 h period
(Table 4). Only those individuals in the schizophrenia group with
non-24 h sleep/wake cycles had either much longer (n = 3) or
shorter (n = 1) periods.
In summary, schizophrenia subgroup II had severe circadian
timing abnormalities with desynchronised sleep/wake patterns
relative to the environmental day/night cycle, excessive sleep and
less activity when awake. Schizophrenia subgroup I showed no
underlying circadian abnormality but sleep was excessively
prolonged, irregular or fragmented.
The circadian rhythm of melatonin sulphate
To evaluate whether the sleep/wake cycles are synchronised to the
body clock phase, we determined weekly 48 h melatonin profiles.
Both the control and schizophrenia group showed a clear cyclic
waveform in melatonin production. All those in the control group
and the majority of those in the schizophrenia group had a

Representative examples of phenotypic variability in rest–activity patterns derived from 6 weeks’ wrist activity
monitoring and concurrent weekly melatonin profiling carried out in the participants’ home environment.
Actograms from individuals in the control group (a–c) show clear entrainment to the day/night cycle with relatively low night-time activity disrupting sleep. Actograms of those
in the schizophrenia group without phase shifts (subgroup I) span from (d) robustly entrained with variable sleep periods to (e) disrupted, and (f) highly irregular rest–activity cycles
accounting for major complaints about problems with sleep. Actograms of those in the schizophrenia group with circadian misalignment (subgroup II) show (g) highly delayed
rest–activity periods with bed times around 04.00 h in the morning and get-up times in the afternoon, (h) reversed rest–activity cycles alternating with free-running periods or
(i) delayed rest–activity periods alternating with free-running periods patterns that were never present in the control group. Blue diamonds indicate peaks in melatonin sulphate
rhythms, which is a marker for the phase of the circadian clock. All controls and the majority of people in schizophrenia subgroup I had melatonin peak times within the normal
range of entrainment whereas individuals in subgroup II had severely delayed or free-running peak times. Actigraphic data are 48 h double-plotted with successive days on vertical
axis. Black bars on the bottom indicate night-time, open bars indicate daytime and the midline indicates midnight between day 1 and 2. Edited data are highlighted with ‘___’, and
times when watch was removed and information missing are filled with ‘xxxxxxx’.

melatonin periodicity of near-24 h. The four individuals with non-
24 h sleep/wake cycles from the schizophrenia subgroup II also
showed non-24 h melatonin cycles (P50.001; Table 5).
The peak of the melatonin cycle occurred at a similar time of
day in the control group and schizophrenia subgroup I but
markedly later in the subgroup II (P50.001) (Fig. 4 and Table
5). Figure 4 illustrates that the melatonin peaks and sleep/activity
phases of the control group and subgroup I are in normal
temporal order internally and synchronised to the day/night cycle.
In subgroup II, sleep/activity phases and melatonin peaks are also
in normal temporal order internally but both are shifted to a
much later external time, and this shift distinguished them as
‘phase-shifted’ schizophrenia subgroup II from the ‘non-shifted’
subgroup I (w2
(2) = 7.367, P= 0.025). The results indicate that
the body clock in this subgroup is not adjusted and internal time
does not coincide with day/night phases.
The amount of melatonin sulphate (mesor) was borderline
different between the three groups (Table 5). Post hoc comparison
showed no difference between controls and the phase-shifted
schizophrenia subgroup II (P = 0.966) but lower melatonin
sulphate levels were found in the non-shifted subgroup I. This
was not related to antipsychotic dose because chlorpromazine
equivalents of antipsychotic dose was not different between the
two schizophrenia subgroups (F = 0.008, P= 0.932, online Table
DS6). However, we noted differences with type of antipsychotics.
Very low amounts of melatonin were found in those in the
schizophrenia group treated with clozapine and amisulpride but
normal levels in individuals treated with olanzapine, risperidone
and
‘high/medium’
potency
antipsychotics
(flupenthixol,
trifluoperazine, zuclopenthixol) (online Table DS7). The majority
of those treated with clozapine and amisulpride belonged to the
non-shifted subgroup I, which could explain the lower amount
of melatonin in this subgroup.
Discussion
In this study, we recorded profound abnormalities in circadian
sleep–wake timing and in the rise and fall of melatonin levels in
people with schizophrenia who have long-standing subjective
sleep problems.
Circadian rhythm desynchronisation
in people with schizophrenia
The sleep–wake cycle and the rise and fall of melatonin levels are
subjected
to
circadian
regulation
that
synchronises
these
behavioural and physiological rhythms with changes in the
environmental
24 h
light/dark
cycle.
The
most
important
difference in the schizophrenia group, in comparison with the
control group, was that 50% showed markedly delayed and/or
free-running sleep–wake cycles. Our repeated melatonin measure-
ments showed that these sleep–wake shifts were always associated
with delayed or free-running circadian rhythms in melatonin,
which implies a lack of synchrony between the body’s internal
rhythm and the external day–night cycle.
Such desynchronisation was not present in our control group
but is reminiscent of that observed in people with delayed sleep

The control group had a somewhat late sleep onset but normal circadian entrainment and sleep offset. Schizophrenia subgroup I show an extended sleep period with normal
circadian melatonin entrainment. Schizophrenia subgroup II show a marked delay in sleep–wake cycles and melatonin peak relative to time of day, indicating abnormal circadian
entrainment in a subset of the schizophrenia group with sleep complaints. Whiskers indicate 95% confidence intervals of the mean.

 Sleep and circadian rhythm disruption in schizophrenia
phase syndrome and non-24 h sleep–wake syndrome,29,30 which
can occur in otherwise healthy individuals living in normal
environmental conditions.31 There are no clear explanations for
the development of this desynchronisation other than when it occurs
in people with a genetic predisposition32 or when there is no light
input to the circadian clock due to eye loss. All our participants
had undergone vision tests and these were found to be normal.
One possible explanation for the abnormal rise and fall in
melatonin in some individuals in our schizophrenia group comes
from a recent experimental study showing that the human
circadian clock, which governs the synthesis of melatonin, can
be entrained to a non-24 h cycle in rest–activity through
concurrent abnormal light exposure.33 This raises the possibility
that the melatonin rhythm in our phase-shifted subgroup became
misaligned secondary to delayed and/or non-24 h rest–activity
cycles. Another explanation could be that the melatonin rhythm
abnormality is primary and that this contributes to sleep and
circadian rhythm disruption. In support of this are findings that
aetiological mechanisms contributing to circadian misalignment
include dysfunction of neurotransmitter systems such as glutamate
and dopamine and risk genes that have been associated both with
core features of schizophrenia and circadian signalling pathways.12,34
Studies of circadian rhythms over extended periods of time in
people with schizophrenia taking medication are scarce and are
non-existent for drug-naive individuals. Of the few longitudinal
case studies published, sleep–wake behaviour has been reported
as free-running sleep–wake cycles for a shortened period in two
people with schizophrenia who were released from external time
cues,35 as a more irregular and delayed rest–activity pattern in
one person,36 whereas more irregular rest–activity patterns and
phase-advanced melatonin and core body temperature rhythms
were found in another individual.37 In a case series of seven people
with schizophrenia, rest–activity recordings over 2–7 weeks showed
a variety of irregular circadian rest–activity cycles, but no non-24 h
rhythms were observed.38 All of these studies have been limited by
small sample sizes and the lack of an adequate control group.
Irregular and fragmented sleep–wake patterns
in schizophrenia
The non-phase shifted schizophrenia subgroup (I) also showed
melatonin rhythms that were stably synchronised with the 24 h
day/night cycle and corresponded well with those of the healthy,
unemployed controls but still showed highly irregular periods of
sleep–wake episodes. All those in the schizophrenia group took
longer to fall asleep and slept consistently longer in comparison
with those in the control group. Longer sleep periods are also in
accordance with observations by Martin et al,39,40 who analysed
rest–activity patterns over 3 days in a cohort of 28 community-
dwelling, mostly unemployed, older people with schizophrenia
(about 58 years old), which they compared with age- and
gender-matched healthy individuals, the majority being employed.
Although we studied younger, middle-aged individuals with
schizophrenia (about 38 years old) and age- and gender-matched
unemployed individuals over 6 weeks (42 days) using actigraphy
and melatonin profiles, our results are consistent with some of
the findings of Martin et al.39,40 For example, the individuals in
our schizophrenia group had similarly low levels of daytime
activity, spent about 10 h in bed, slept about 8.25 h and some
had severely fragmented sleep and daytime naps despite having
regular, synchronised melatonin rhythms.
Mechanism of impairment
One possible explanation of the circadian misalignment and
abnormal
sleep–wake patterns
found in
our
schizophrenia
subgroup II could be a lack of daily routine. We think that this
is unlikely because our control group were unemployed and were
similar to our schizophrenia group in that they also lacked
externally imposed routines. However, although they showed late
sleep onset, consistent with lack of daily routine, they displayed
none of the abnormalities suggestive of circadian misalignment.
In addition there was no association in the schizophrenia group
between their circadian parameters and their general level of
function as measured by the GAF scale.
Another explanation could be the effect of antipsychotic
medication, which may explain increased sleep time, irrespective
of group, and decreased daytime activity due to sedation or effects
on motivation. However, we found no evidence that medication
dose was related to any of the circadian abnormalities. The type
of medication was also not specifically associated with any
circadian
composite
profile,
although
those
treated
with
risperidone showed the least pathological phenotype on all
measures taken (rest–activity, sleep, melatonin). Whether this
is a consequence of type of medication or other factors such
as environmental conditions, social support, clinical status,
length of illness or a random effect cannot be established at this
time.
Although the possible contribution of these external factors
requires further clarification, our data points to the involvement
of circadian disruption among the highly diverse sleep–wake
phenotypes found in people with schizophrenia.
Consequences of circadian rhythm and sleep–wake
disruption
Although we have provided a detailed correlation between
schizophrenia
and
sleep–wake
disruption,
we
have
yet
to
demonstrate a mechanistic link between the two. To establish
whether this is genetic, one approach would be to examine the
sleep and circadian phenotype of individuals at high familial risk
for developing schizophrenia; another would be to examine the
sleep phenotype of mice with mutations in genes linked to
schizophrenia. Possible drug effects could be examined by
studying the longitudinal pattern of sleep in individuals at the
time of initial diagnosis when unmedicated and following
pharmacological treatment.
Chronically disturbed sleep has a strong impact on social
function, mood, cognition and quality of life in people with
schizophrenia.41 In a recent study, circadian integrity was strongly
associated with outcome measures of cognitive performance but
not symptom severity or length of illness.42 Those with disrupted
circadian rhythms (daytime sleepiness, more fragmented sleep and
delayed melatonin release) performed worse in neuropsychological
tasks than those with schizophrenia who had normal circadian
rhythms. Thus, whatever the cause of sleep–wake disruption in
schizophrenia, actigraphy is a procedure of clinical relevance for
establishing the nature of the circadian sleep–wake abnormalities
with
a
view
to
assessing
and
tailoring
chronotherapeutic
interventions.
Limitations of the study
Our results provide the basis for further research. For example, it
would be important to clarify the effect of type and dose of
antipsychotic and adjunctive medications using a larger number
of participants. In addition, although we screened for symptoms
of comorbid sleep disorders, we did not utilise objective
measurements to detect akathisia, restless leg syndrome, periodic
leg movement disorder or obstructive sleep apnoea.
