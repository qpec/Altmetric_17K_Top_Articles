In Brief
The acetylcholine pathway has been
proposed to be important for
wakefulness and REM sleep, but genetic

Chrm3 double knockout chronically
diminishes REM sleep to an undetectable
level and causes a severe short-sleep
phenotype.

SUMMARY
Sleep regulation involves interdependent signaling
among specialized neurons in distributed brain re-
gions. Although acetylcholine promotes wakefulness
and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, it is unclear
whether the cholinergic pathway is essential (i.e.,
absolutely required) for REM sleep because of redun-
dancy from neural circuits to molecules. First, we
demonstrate that synaptic inhibition of TrkA+ cholin-
ergic neurons causes a severe short-sleep pheno-
type and that sleep reduction is mostly attributable
to a shortened sleep duration in the dark phase. Sub-
sequent comprehensive knockout of acetylcholine
receptor genes by the triple-target CRISPR method
reveals that a similar short-sleep phenotype appears
in
the
knockout
of
two
Gq-type
acetylcholine
receptors Chrm1 and Chrm3. Strikingly, Chrm1
and Chrm3 double knockout chronically diminishes
REM sleep to an almost undetectable level. These re-
sults suggest that muscarinic acetylcholine recep-
tors, Chrm1 and Chrm3, are essential for REM sleep.
INTRODUCTION
Acetylcholine was the first identified neurotransmitter (Dale,
1937), and the cholinergic system is one of the most extensively
studied
regulatory
systems for mammalian
sleep
(Brown
et al., 2012). The pioneering studies reported that pathological
damages to the brain regions, which later appeared to be major
cholinergic sources, resulted in sleep disorders (Economo, 1930;
McGinty and Sterman, 1968; Nauta, 1946). The discovery of the
regulatory site for rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in the brain-
stem (Jouvet, 1962) was affirmed by the induction of REM-sleep-
like state by cholinergic agonists injected into the site (Cordeau
et al., 1963; George et al., 1964). Therefore, the long-standing
model of the transition from non-rapid eye movement (NREM)
sleep to REM sleep incorporated acetylcholine as a key factor
(Hobson et al., 1975; McCarley, 2004). In addition, acetylcholine
release was found to be abundant in the brainstem during REM
sleep (Kodama et al., 1990) and in the cortex during REM sleep
and wakefulness (Teles-Grilo Ruivo et al., 2017). Despite this ev-
idence, it is unclear whether cholinergic regulation is essential,
i.e., required, for REM sleep, because multilayer complexity
from neural circuits to molecules may compensate for perturba-
tion of the cholinergic system at any one level. For example,

 cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain (BF) and regions of the
brainstem, including the laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT) and the
pedunculopontine tegmentum (PPT), are crucial for REM sleep
(McCarley, 2004), but lesioning each of those cholinergic sites
results in relatively minor effects (Brown et al., 2012), empha-
sizing the need for further neuronal subtyping to untangle the
spatially intermingled circuits (Chung et al., 2017; Hayashi
et al., 2015; Weber and Dan, 2016; Xu et al., 2015). In addition,
there are eleven mammalian neuronal-type nicotinic acetylcho-
line receptors, and five muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (Gotti
and Clementi, 2004; Wess, 2004), which results in considerable
redundancy that hinders the identification of critical cholinergic
receptors. Although in vivo pharmacological manipulations
demonstrated that muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are
important for the regulation of REM sleep (Brown et al., 2012),
genetic approaches to assess the contribution of muscarinic
acetylcholine receptors have been limited (Goutagny et al.,
2005), and it is unknown which muscarinic receptors are partic-
ularly important and whether they are indispensable for the regu-
lation of REM sleep.
To investigate these complexities, we took comprehensive ge-
netic approaches to evaluate the role of cholinergic molecular
factors in mice. First, we established a neuronal subtype of
cholinergic neurons by finding enriched expression of the neuro-
trophic receptor tyrosine kinase 1 (Ntrk1) (also called TrkA) gene
and its potential co-receptor nerve growth factor receptor (Ngfr)
in the brain region encompassing the basal forebrain. Temporally
controlled synaptic inhibition of TrkA-expressing (TrkA+) and
Ngfr-expressing (Ngfr+) neurons demonstrated that those neu-
rons were crucial for sleep. Interestingly, the short-sleep pheno-
type caused by inhibition of TrkA+ and Ngfr+ neurons was
associated with consolidated wakefulness in the dark phase,
rendering the daily sleep profile more biphasic rather than the
polyphasic profile naturally seen in mice and rats. Next, we iden-
tified the acetylcholine receptors whose inhibition recapitulates
the characteristic short-sleep profile observed by inhibition of
TrkA+ and Ngfr+ neurons. We knocked out most acetylcholine
receptor genes identified in mice by a triple-target CRISPR
method (Sunagawa et al., 2016) and found that loss of two Gq-
type muscarinic acetylcholine receptors—Chrm1 and Chrm3—
induced the characteristic short-sleep profile. Both single knock-
outs of Chrm1 and Chrm3 reduced NREM sleep and reduced
and fragmented REM sleep, respectively. Double-knockout of
Chrm1 and Chrm3 diminished REM sleep to an almost undetect-
able level. These findings suggested that muscarinic acetylcho-
line receptors Chrm1 and Chrm3 are essential for sleep regula-
tion, especially for REM sleep, and function in different ways.
RESULTS
Synaptic Inhibition of TrkA-Positive Neurons by Tetanus
Toxin Induced a Characteristic Short-Sleep Phenotype
with Consolidated Wake in the Dark Phase
For subtyping neurons in the BF/preoptic area (POA) regions,
which have been shown to be important for sleep regulation
(Brown et al., 2012), we performed genome-wide mRNA expres-
sion profiling of the BF and/or POA region along with data from
48 other brain regions in the BrainStars database (Figures 1A
and S1A; Kasukawa et al., 2011). We found 22 candidate marker
genes that were significantly enriched in the sampled BF and/or
POA region (Figure 1B). Among them, we focused on TrkA and
Ngfr, because NGF was implicated in the regulation of sleep
(Ramos et al., 2011) and the majority of TrkA+ neurons in the
BF and/or POA region coexpress choline acetyltransferase
(ChAT) (Sobreviela et al., 1994; Figures 1B–1F). To examine the
function of TrkA+ neurons, we first established TrkA-tTA bacte-
rial artificial chromosome (BAC)-Tg mice and confirmed that
the TrkA-tTA-driven gene was expressed in the BF and/or POA
region by crossing TrkA-tTA mice with two independent reporter
strains—tetO-tdTomato and tetO-tauLacZ mice (Li et al., 2010;
Reijmers et al., 2007; Figures 1G–1I and S1B).
Then we crossed TrkA-tTA mice with tetO-EGFP/TeNT mice
(Wada et al., 2007; Yamamoto et al., 2003) and produced dou-
ble-transgenic TrkA-TeNT mice. In TrkA-TeNT mice, tetanus
toxin (TeNT) is expressed and inhibits synaptic vesicle release
in TrkA+ neurons under the control of Tet-off system. Shortly

 after birth, we provided mice with food containing 40 ppm doxy-
cycline (dox-food) via their parental mother. After weaning and
maturation with dox-food, we released mice to food without
doxycycline (normal-food) and maintained mice for four weeks
to allow for TeNT expression and inhibit TrkA+ neurons (from
week 1 to week 4 in Figure S3A). We monitored the daily sleep
profile using the non-invasive respiration-based automated
sleep phenotyping system—snappy sleep stager (SSS) (Suna-
gawa et al., 2016)—and, at week 4 with normal-food, found a
severe short-sleep phenotype of 593.0 ± 26.3 min (mean ±
SEM; n = 6) of total sleep duration in a day, which was
173.0 min shorter than that of control littermates (n = 13; p <
0.001; Figures 2A–2C and S3A–S3D). Here, we used littermates
as control that harbored only one or none of the two transgenes.
Reduction of the sleep duration was mostly attributable to
decreased PWS (the transition probability from wakefulness to
sleep), especially at night, hence consolidated wakefulness in
the dark phase, which resulted in a high-amplitude variation in
sleep duration (Figures 2B and 2C). This high-amplitude varia-
tion of TrkA-TeNT mice is apparent in the contrast between
the light (resting) and the dark (active) phases in the time series
of sleep duration represented by the heatmap (Figure 2A). In
addition, there was a period of partially recovered sleep propen-
sity at the late dark phase (Figure 2B). We confirmed that TeNT
expression was induced in the BF and/or POA regions at week 2
and 3 by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis (Figures
S4A and S4B). On and after week 5, we returned TrkA-TeNT
mice to dox-food, and the characteristic short-sleep phenotype
gradually weakened after one month and almost diminished
three months later (week 16; Figures 2D–2F and S3A–S3D).
We also confirmed that TeNT expression was not detected in
the BF and/or POA regions at week 16 by FISH analysis (Figures
S4A and S4B). These temporally controlled phenotypes were
confirmed with different concentrations of doxycycline (Figures
S3E–S3H).
Electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) re-
cordings of sleep phenotypes of TrkA-TeNT mice recapitulated
the characteristic short-sleep profile (Figure 2G), eliminating
the possibility that TrkA-TeNT mice had an abnormality in the
respiration
system
that
might
confound
SSS
recordings.
Although the EEG power spectrum did not have a notable
change (Figure S7D), sleep duration was 636.2 ± 29.8 min
(mean ± SEM; n = 5), which was 134 min shorter than that of con-
trol littermates (p < 0.01; n = 4). The reduction was mostly attrib-
utable to a significant reduction of the duration of NREM sleep
(Figure 2H). Although the duration of the REM sleep was not
significantly changed over a day at 57.2 ± 3.2 min (mean ±
SEM; n = 5) compared with that of the control littermates at
69.2 ± 5.9 min (mean ± SEM; n = 4; p > 0.1), focused in the
dark phase, it was significantly reduced at 3.9 ± 1.0 min
(mean ± SEM), which was 5.7 min shorter than that of the control
littermates (p < 0.01; Figure 2I).
We also generated Ngfr-TeNT mice by crossing Ngfr-tTA mice
(Figure S2D) with tetO-EGFP/TeNT mice. Both SSS analysis and
EEG and EMG recordings revealed that they had the character-
istic short-sleep profile with consolidated wake in the early dark
phase (Figures 2J–2L, S2H, and S2I). Although the EEG
power spectrum did not have a significant change (Figure S7E),
the sleep duration measured by SSS was 620.9 ± 26.5 min
(mean ± SEM; n = 7), which was 132 min shorter than that of
control littermates (p < 0.01; n = 13; Figures 2J–2L). Furthermore,
without temporal dox administration, the characteristic sleep
phenotype was also observed in both TrkA-TeNT and Ngfr-
TeNT mice (Figures S2A–S2C and S2E–S2G).
In addition, inhibition of TrkA+ neurons in circadian-clock-defi-
cient mice (Per1/2 double-knockout [DKO] mice; Bae et al., 2001)
demonstrated that the function of TrkA+ neurons does not require
a functional circadian clock (Figures S2J–S2O), excluding the
possibility that TrkA+ neurons might have a role in the circadian
process (process C) of the two-process model (Borbe
´ ly, 1982).

 Together, these results suggested that TrkA- and Ngfr-express-
ing neurons regulate sleep in a way that promotes sleep.
Specific Rescue of ChAT-Positive Neurons in TrkA-TeNT
Mice Restored Sleep Duration
The majority of TrkA+ neurons in the BF and/or POA region are
cholinergic (Sobreviela et al., 1994), but TrkA expression was
also found in non-cholinergic neurons in other brain regions,
including the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) (Holtzman et al.,
1995), which is implicated in the regulation of REM sleep (Funato
et al., 2010). To further characterize TrkA+ neurons that are
responsible for the characteristic short-sleep phenotype of
TrkA-TeNT mice, we designed a Tet effector tTR, which stands
for tTA repressor. tTR inhibits tTA activity only when both are
coexpressed in the same cells in a similar manner of Gal80 and
Gal4 in fruit fly genetics (Figure 3A; Lee and Luo, 1999). In
cultured cell analysis, tTR effectively repressed tTA-induced
tetO-luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3B).
For in vivo application of tTR, we first established embryonic
stem cells (ESCs) from TrkA-TeNT mice. Then we generated
two different tTR knockin strains, ChAT-tTR and VgluT1-tTR,
with TrkA-TeNT ESCs and the TALEN-based gene-targeting
strategy (STAR Methods; Ode et al., 2017b; Ukai et al., 2017).
In TrkA-TeNT;VGluT1-tTR mice, the characteristic short-sleep
phenotype of TrkA-TeNT mice did not change (Figures 3C–3E).
On the other hand, in TrkA-TeNT;ChAT-tTR mice, the short-
sleep phenotype was mostly abolished (Figures 3C–3E). FISH
analysis of those mice confirmed that TeNT expression was sup-
pressed in TrkA-TeNT;ChAT-tTR mice, but not in TrkA-TeNT;
VGluT1-tTR mice (Figure 3F). Furthermore, we generated
VGluT1-tTR or ChAT-tTR single-knockin mice and confirmed
that tTR and either VGluT1 or ChAT was coexpressed by FISH
(Figures S4C and S4D). These results suggested the TrkA+
cholinergic neurons are primarily responsible for the character-
istic phenotype observed in TrkA-TeNT mice (Figures 2A–2C).
Comprehensive Analysis of Nicotinic Acetylcholine
Receptor KO Mice Showed Moderate Effects
After we discovered that TrkA+ cholinergic neurons have a
crucial role in the regulation of sleep, we sought to elucidate
the function of cholinergic receptors by comprehensively exam-
ining the phenotypes of acetylcholine receptor knockout (KO)
mice.
There are two different families of acetylcholine receptors—
nicotinic receptors and muscarinic receptors. Nicotinic acetyl-
choline receptors (nAchR) consist of five types of subunits—
alpha (a1–10), beta (b2–5), delta, epsilon, and gamma. These
subunits can be divided into the muscle type and neuronal
type. We focused on the mammalian neuronal type and targeted
eleven
genes—Chrna2,
Chrna3,
Chrna4,
Chrna5,
Chrna6,
Chrna7, Chrna9, Chrna10, Chrnb2, Chrnb3, and Chrnb4 (Gotti
and Clementi, 2004). To efficiently produce KO mice of each
gene, we used a triple-target CRISPR method (STAR Methods).
The genotype of KO mice was confirmed by qPCR (Figure S5;
Table S2). KO of Chrna3 was lethal because mice died shortly af-
ter birth (n = 26), which was consistent with the result of the con-
ventional KO method (Xu et al., 1999). Among the KO mice,
Chrnb2 KO had a sleep profile resembling that of TrkA-TeNT
mice (Figures 4A–4C and 2A–2C), but changes in sleep and
wake parameters, including sleep duration, amplitude, and
PWS, were not significant within the statistical power achieved
by availability of the mutant mice. Changes in other KO mice
were weaker than those of Chrnb2 KO, and none were significant
(Figure 4C). Chrnb3 KO mice (n = 8), which were obtained in an
additional batch of KO mice production at different research
site, had significant changes in amplitude and PWS, but the
change of sleep duration was moderate at 649.3 ± 13.5 min
(mean ± SEM; n = 8), which was only 38.3 min shorter than
that of wild-type (WT) mice (less than 0.76 SD; p < 0.05; n =
108; Figures 4D–4F). These results suggested that nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors have relatively minor roles in the regula-
tion of sleep.
Comprehensive Analysis of Muscarinic Acetylcholine
Receptor KO Mice Revealed that Chrm1 and Chrm3 Are
Important for Sleep Regulation
Therefore, we focused on muscarinic acetylcholine receptors
(mAchRs), which are G-protein-coupled receptors comprising
five members (Chrm1, Chrm2, Chrm3, Chrm4, and Chrm5;
Wess, 2004), and comprehensively examined KO phenotypes

characteristic short-sleep profile with consolidated wake in the
early dark phase, which resembled the sleep profile of TrkA-
TeNT mice (Figures 5A–5C and 2A–2C). Sleep duration was
decreased to 642.3 ± 25.5 min in Chrm1 KO mice (mean ±
SEM; n = 8) and 607.0 ± 7.0 min in Chrm3 KO mice (mean ±
SEM; n = 11), which was 82.4 min and 117.7 min shorter, respec-
tively, (p < 0.01 and more than 1.85 SD for Chrm1 and p < 0.001
and more than 2.64 SD for Chrm3) compared to that of WT mice
(n = 108).
To preclude the possibility of off-target effects of the CRISPR
guide RNAs used for producing Chrm1 KO and Chrm3 KO mice
(set 1 in Figures 5A–5C and S6), we produced another group of
KO mice using independent CRISPR guide RNAs (set 2; Fig-
ure S6) and confirmed the observed characteristic short-sleep
phenotypes (Figures 5D–5G). These results strongly suggested
that the observed short-sleep phenotype of Chrm1 and Chrm3
KO mice cannot be attributed to the possible off-target
effects of CRISPR but rather to the common genomic defects
in the Chrm1 and Chrm3 genes, respectively. Importantly, the
observed reduction of sleep duration in Chrm1 KO mice (set 2)
and Chrm3 KO mice (set 2) was mostly attributable to the
decreased PWS in the early dark phase (Figures 5F and 5G),
which was also observed in Chrm1 KO mice (set 1) and Chrm3
KO mice (set 1; Figures 5B and 5C) as well as in TrkA-TeNT
mice (Figures 2B and 2C).
Chrm3 KO Reduced the Duration of NREM Sleep and
Fragmented REM Sleep
To further ensure that the characteristic short-sleep pheno-
type was not because of an artifact of sleep evaluation by
the respiration-based SSS, we performed EEG and EMG
recordings of Chrm1 and Chrm3 KO mice (set 1) used
in the previous measurement (Figures 5A–5C) and confirmed
the characteristic sleep profile with consolidated wake in
the dark phase (Figures 6A, 6D, and 6G). Interestingly, EEG
and EMG revealed that Chrm1 KO and Chrm3 KO mice had
different sleep architectures (Figures 6B and 6E). Notably,
the power spectrum of Chrm3 KO mice displayed increased
power both in the delta (0.5–4 Hz) and theta (6–10 Hz) domains
in sleep, implying that the synchrony of cortical neurons was
increased at those frequency domains in Chrm3 KO mice (Fig-
ures S7A and S7B).
In Chrm3 KO mice, the duration of NREM sleep in a day was
significantly reduced at 542.9 ± 16.5 min, which was 152.5 min
shorter than that of WT mice (n = 6; p < 0.001), but the duration
of REM sleep in a day did not significantly change at 73.7 ±
4.4 min compared with that of WT mice (p = 0.86; Figure 6E).
The reduction of the duration of NREM sleep was attributable
to decreased PWN (the transition probability from wakefulness
to NREM sleep) and increased PWW (the transition probability
from wakefulness to wakefulness or the probability of staying
in wakefulness), especially in the dark phase (Figures 6F and
6G; Table S3). The duration of REM sleep did not significantly
change (Table S3). However, the transition probabilities be-
tween REM sleep and NREM sleep (PRN and PNR) were mutu-
ally increased (Figure 6F), especially in the light phase (Fig-
ure 6G). The increased transition with the retained total
duration of REM sleep indicated that REM sleep was frag-
mented, and hence, PRR (the transition probability from REM
sleep to REM sleep or the probability of staying in REM sleep)
was decreased (Figure 6F), resulting in the reduced episode
duration of REM sleep (Table S3C). Together, these observa-
tions suggested that Chrm3 has a role in regulating the duration
of NREM sleep in a day but also contributes to the consolida-
tion of REM sleep.
Chrm1 KO Reduced the Duration of REM Sleep
In contrast to Chrm3 KO mice that retained the duration of REM
sleep in a day, Chrm1 KO mice had a significantly decreased
duration of REM sleep in a day at 47.4 ± 4.8 min, which was
33.6 min shorter than that of WT mice (n = 7; p < 0.001; Figures
6B and 6E; Table S3). The reduction in the duration of REM sleep
was accounted for by an increased PRN (the transition probability
from REM sleep to NREM sleep), implying weakened mainte-
nance of REM sleep (Figures 6C and 6G; Table S3). Although
not as much as Chrm3 KO mice, Chrm1 KO mice also had a sig-
nificant reduction in the duration of NREM sleep at 612.6 ±
23.6 min, which was 116.8 min shorter than that of WT mice
(n = 7; p < 0.001). The reduction of the duration of NREM sleep
was mostly attributable to reduced PWN and increased PWW,
especially in the dark phase (Figures 6C and 6G; Table S3),
which resulted in the characteristic short-sleep profile with
consolidated wakefulness in the dark phase as was observed

 in Chrm3 KO mice (Figures 6A and 6G). These observations sug-
gested that Chrm1 has a role in regulating the duration of REM
sleep but also contributes to the duration of NREM sleep.
Chrm1 and Chrm3 Are Essential for REM Sleep and
Important for NREM Sleep
Compared to TrkA-TeNT mice, changes in sleep phenotype,
especially changes in amplitude and PWS, of Chrm1 KO mice
and Chrm3 KO mice were moderate (Figures 5G and 2C; Table
S3). To examine the combinatorial effect of Chrm1 and Chrm3
for sleep, we produced Chrm1 and Chrm3 double-KO mice
(Chrm1/3 dKO mice) by triple-target CRISPR (set 1/set 1;
Figure S6O) and measured phenotypes using SSS (Figures
6H–6J). Chrm1/3 double-KO mice had changes in sleep dura-
tion, amplitude, and PWS to a degree comparable to that of
TrkA-TeNT mice (Figures 6I, 6J, 2B, and 2C; Table S3). In
Chrm1/3 double-KO mice, sleep duration in a day was reduced
to 591.1 ± 16.8 min (mean ± SEM; n = 5), which was 133.6 min
shorter, amplitude was increased, and PWS was decreased
compared to that of control mice (n = 108; p < 0.001 and more
than 2.85 SD for the sleep duration; p < 0.001 for amplitude;
p < 0.001 for PWS; Figures 6J and 2C; Table S3). Decreased
PWS, especially in the dark phase, resulted in the characteristic
short-sleep profile with consolidated wakefulness in the early
dark phase (Figure 6I). In addition, both TrkA-TeNT mice and
Chrm1/3 double-KO mice consistently exhibited the enhanced
rebound sleep after sleep deprivation, which suggested that ho-
meostatic sleep control remained functional in those mutant
mice (Figures S7F–S7I).
We observed the phenotypes of Chrm1/3 double-KO mice by
EEG and EMG recordings, which confirmed the characteristic
short-sleep phenotype with consolidated wakefulness in the
dark phase (Figure 6K). Strikingly, dKO of Chrm1 and Chrm3
diminished REM sleep to an almost undetectable level (Figure 6L;
Table S3). We did not find any overt abnormality resembling
those found in REM behavior disorder (RBD) (Krenzer et al.,
2011; Lu et al., 2006) by visual inspection of recorded video
at timing of EEG theta-oscillation dominant period. We also
checked transition periods from NREM sleep to wakefulness,
which might contain REM sleep masked by RBD, and did not
find any abnormality (Krenzer et al., 2011; Lu et al., 2006).
Although the interruption of REM sleep by abnormal behaviors
could increase the transition probability from REM sleep to
wakefulness (PRW) by conventional EEG analysis, PRW did not
exhibit any marked increase either in Chrm1 and Chrm3 single-
KO mice (Figures 6C and 6F), which supports the claim that
RBD is not masking REM sleep in Chrm1/3 double-KO mice.
Interestingly, the hypnograms showed that there is virtually no
emergence of typical polygraphic manifestation of REM sleep,
that is, a lasting low-delta power and low muscle tone in the
Chrm1/3 double-KO mice (Figure 7C). In line with this observa-
tion, the EEG power spectrum of Chrm1/3 double-KO mice dis-
played reduced theta power in NREM sleep (Figure S7C).
To further ensure loss of REM sleep, we produced another
group of Chrm1/3 double-KO ESC mice by injecting CRISPR-
edited ESCs into 8-cell stage embryos (Ode et al., 2017a; Ukai
et al., 2017) and performed EEG and EMG recordings to evaluate
the response of sleep deprivation in Chrm1/3 double-KO ESC
mice. Chrm1/3 double-KO ESC mice were implanted with EEG
and EMG probes, housed in a 12:12 hr light-dark cycle, and stim-
ulated with the gentle touch of a brush to deprive sleep from zeit-
geber time 6 (ZT6) to ZT12. REM sleep in Chrm1/3 double-KO
ESC mice was virtually not detected both before and after sleep
deprivation, despite a rebound in total sleep (14.3% increase; p <
0.01 from 276.7 ± 11.4 min in basal duration to 316.2 ± 11.0 min
in rebound duration) and rebound REM sleep (154.4% increase;
p < 0.001 from 16.5 ± 2.8 min to 37.4 ± 1.3 min) in the control WT
mice or rebound total sleep in Chrm1/3 double-KO ESC mice
(49.5% increase; p < 0.05 from 112.9 ± 16.1 min in basal duration
to 168.8 ± 18.7 min in rebound duration; Figure 6M). These re-
sults demonstrated that two Gq-type muscarinic acetylcholine
receptors Chrm1 and Chrm3 are essential for REM sleep.
DISCUSSION
Since the pioneering works of defining REM sleep based on EEG
and EMG (Aserinsky and Kleitman, 1953; Dement and Kleitman,
1957) and demonstrating that neural circuits in the brainstem are
necessary and sufficient for REM sleep generation (Jouvet,
1962), our knowledge on the neural circuitry for regulating REM
sleep has been steadily advancing (Hayashi et al., 2015; Weber
and Dan, 2016). However, the essential molecular factors for
defining and translating the output of the brainstem circuit to
the collective activity of cortical neurons have been elusive. Mul-
tiple lines of in vivo pharmacological evidence consistently indi-
cated that muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are important for
the regulation of REM sleep. Muscarinic receptor agonists and
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors increase REM sleep and shorten
REM latency (the delay of the onset of REM sleep to that of
NREM sleep; Brown et al., 2012). Moreover, muscarinic receptor

 antagonists decrease REM sleep and lengthen REM latency
(Brown et al., 2012). Nonetheless, genetic approaches to assess
the contribution of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors to REM
sleep regulation have been limited (Goutagny et al., 2005), and
it is unknown which muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are
required for the regulation of REM sleep. In the present study,
our comprehensive genetic assays of acetylcholine receptors re-
vealed that two Gq-type muscarinic acetylcholine receptors
Chrm1 and Chrm3 of the five muscarinic acetylcholine receptors
from Chrm1 to Chrm5 are important for REM sleep. KO of other
Gq-type receptor Chrm5 did not significantly change sleep phe-
notypes, which may reflect the low abundance of Chrm5 in the
brain. Chrm1 and Chrm3 are broadly expressed in different brain
regions, including the cortex and the hippocampus, but Chrm5 is
expressed in relatively limited regions, such as the substantia ni-
gra and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), in the midbrain (Basile
et al., 2002; Buckley et al., 1988; Yasuda et al., 1993). Chrm1/3
double-KO mice had an almost complete loss of REM sleep,
which strongly suggested that Chrm1 and Chrm3 are essential
for REM sleep.
In addition, the Chrm1/3 double-KO mice exhibited the char-
acteristic short-sleep profile with consolidated wakefulness in
the early dark phase. This characteristic phenotype was also
observed in Chrm1 and Chrm3 single-KO mice and in TrkA-
TeNT mice. Reduction of sleep duration of all those mice was
mostly attributable to the reduced duration of NREM sleep, indi-
cating that cholinergic regulation is also important for NREM
sleep. Impaired REM sleep might also reduce the duration of
NREM sleep (Hayashi et al., 2015) because our observation indi-
cated that the loss of either Chrm1 (Figures 6B, 6C, 7A, and 7D),
Chrm3 (Figures 6E, 6F, 7B, and 7E), or both (Figures 6L, 7C, and
7F) resulted in reduced, fragmented, and diminished REM sleep,
respectively. However, the question of how cholinergic path-
ways regulate NREM sleep remains unresolved (Figure 7G).
Recent optogenetic and pharmacogenetic studies suggested
that cholinergic neurons promote wakefulness at the circuit level
(Chen et al., 2016; Shi et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015; Zant et al.,
2016), whereas our results indicated that cholinergic regulation
suppresses wakefulness at the systems level. This apparent
inconsistency may be reconciled by hypothesizing muscarinic
modulation of other neurotransmitter systems, such as glutama-
tergic neurons (Kamsler et al., 2010; Weng et al., 2014) and
GABAergic neurons (Xiao et al., 2009), or by hypothesizing the
proximal projection of TrkA+ neurons to sleep-promoting neu-
rons, such as POA GABAergic neurons, that inhibit wake-pro-
moting neurons in the tuberomammillary histaminergic neurons
(TMNs) (Chung et al., 2017). Indeed, a specific cholinergic re-
ceptor could be sleep-promoting although overall effect of the
cholinergic system is wake promoting, as reported for the redeye
mutant in Drosophila, where REM sleep has so far not been iden-
tified (Shi et al., 2014), implying the sleep-promoting cholinergic
effect might be independent of REM sleep (Figure 7G).
Our findings of the essential role of Chrm1 and Chrm3 genes in
REM sleep will provide useful tools in future studies of REM
sleep. In particular, the finding of unexpected viability despite
the almost completely abolished REM sleep will allow us to rigor-
ously verify whether REM sleep plays crucial roles in funda-
mental functions of organism, such as learning and memory
(Crick and Mitchison, 1983; Dement et al., 1967; Li et al.,
2017), and open a way to study its underlying molecular and
cellular mechanisms.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Cultivation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells
Cultivation of mouse ES cells was conducted with the same protocol described in the previous report (Ode et al., 2017b; Ukai et al.,
2017). Before cultivation, the surface of PURECoatTM amine dishes (Beckton-Dickinson, NJ, U.S.A.) were exposed to medium con-
taining LIF plus 6-bromoindirubin-30-oxime (BIO) (Sato et al., 2009) for more than 5 hours at 37�C with 5% CO2. ES cells were
cultured with or without feeder cells in 3i medium (Clontech Laboratories, Inc. A Takara Bio Company, Japan) at 37�C with 5% CO2.
Mice and sleep phenotyping
All experimental procedures and housing conditions were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of RIKEN
Kobe Branch, and all the animals were cared for and treated humanely in accordance with the Institutional Guidelines for Experiments
using Animals. All mice were given food and water ad libitum and maintained at ambient temperature and humidity. The light was
controlled under 12 h light and 12 h dark cycle. Production and sleep phenotyping of Chrna2, Chrna4, Chrna5, Chrna6, Chrna7,
Chrna9, Chrna10, Chrnb2, and Chrnb4 KO mice were performed in RIKEN CDB at Kobe using the sleep phenotype of C57BL/6N
mice (n = 108) published in our previous paper for data on control mice (Sunagawa et al., 2016). Creation and sleep phenotyping
of Chrnb3, Chrm1, Chem2, Chrm3, Chrm4, and Chrm5 KO mice were performed in RIKEN QBiC at Osaka using C57BL/6N mice
(n = 107) for control data.

 Transfection and Luciferase Assay
293T cells (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC) were maintained in DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, U.S.A.) supplemented
with 10% FBS (Merck, Germany) and antibiotics (100 U/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin; Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA,
U.S.A.) at 37�C with 5% CO2. One day prior to transfection, cells were plated onto 35 mm dishes at a density of 4 3 105 cells per
well. The following day, 293T cells were co-transfected using FuGene6 (Roche, Switzerland) with 0.2 mg of a luciferase reporter
plasmid (ptetO-Luc) and the indicated amount (mg) of effector plasmids (pEF-tTA and pEF-tTR) (pEF-BOS vectors were previously
developed (Mizushima and Nagata, 1990)) in Figure 3B (n = 3), according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and cultured at
37�C. Empty vector was used to make up the total amount of DNA to 2 mg per well. Additionally, 40 ng of a pRL-SV40 plasmid (Renilla
luciferase (RLuc) reporter vector; Promega, WI, U.S.A.) was added to each transfection as an internal control for transfection effi-
ciency. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were harvested and assayed with a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System
(Promega, WI, U.S.A.). Luciferase (FLuc) activity was normalized by RLuc activity. Data are representative of two independent
experiments.
METHOD DETAILS
Sampling of POA/BF regions
The samples of POA/BF regions were collected with the same protocol used in the previous report (Kasukawa et al., 2011). That is,
5-week BALB/c male mice were conditioned under a standard 12:12 light/dark cycle (LD) for 2 weeks, and samples were obtained
under LD or constant darkness (DD) conditions every 4 h for 1 day starting at ZT0. At each time point, 0.5 mm-thick slices of mouse
brain were cut on a Mouse Brain Matrix (Neuroscience Inc., Japan) and frozen. POA/BF regions in the brain slices were punched out
bilaterally with a microdissecting needle (gauge 0.5 mm) under a stereomicroscope. We sampled 25 mice at each time point. The
whole procedure was repeated twice (n = 2) to obtain experimental replicates.
Microarray analysis
In obtaining an expression profile of POA/BF regions, we used the same experimental procedure as one used in the previous report
(Kasukawa et al., 2011). Briefly, total RNA was extracted from the pooled POA/BF samples using Trizol reagent (Thermo Fisher Sci-
entific, MA, U.S.A.). RNA samples were reverse transcribed, labeled, and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0
according to the manufacturer’s instruction (Affymetrix one-cycle method). The expression values were summarized together with
the samples used in the previous report (Kasukawa et al., 2011) by the RMA method. CNS region-specific genes were identified
with the method described in the previous report (GEO; GSE107500) (Kasukawa et al., 2011).
Generation of TrkA-tTA and Ngfr-tTA transgenic mouse lines
BAC DNAs (R24-222B4 for TrkA-tTA and R24-309N6 for Ngfr-tTA) were obtained from BACPAC resources center at CHORI. BAC
modification was performed by recombineering (Warming et al., 2005). Briefly, tTA and SV40 polyA signal sequences were amplified
from pTet-off (Clontech, CA, U.S.A.) and inserted into just after the start codon of TrkA or Ngfr genes by recombineering. Modified
BAC DNAs were confirmed by electrophoresis and purified by NucleoBond Xtra midi (Macherey-Nagel, Germany). Purified transgene
DNA was eluted with TE (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) buffer, diluted with PBS(-) buffer to a final concentration of 5 ng/mL,
and injected into pronuclei of C57BL/6N zygotes as reported previously (Abe et al., 2013). Transgenic lines termed TrkA-tTA (Acces-
sion number CDB0522T: http://www2.clst.riken.jp/arg/TG%20mutant%20mice%20list.html) and Ngfr-tTA (Accession number
CDB0523T: http://www2.clst.riken.jp/arg/TG%20mutant%20mice%20list.html) were selected for analysis based on PCR screening
and fertility. Transgenic lines were successively backcrossed with C57BL/6N; mice were genotyped by PCR with the primers
50-ggaaggcgagctggcattagggcctcaaaa-30, 50-cgacatccagacagtgactgcgcggctctg-30, and 50-tcttgccatgactcgccttccagggggcag-30 for
TrkA-tTA, and the primers 50-gaggaggcggggctgctgcattgccttcac-30, 50-gactgctcccagtctcctacaccgcacccg-30, and 50-tcttgccat
gactcgccttccagggggcag-30 for Ngfr-tTA, yielding 619 bp and 434 bp products (TrkA-tTA) and 585 bp and 426 bp products (Ngfr-
tTA), respectively.
Construction of tTR
Our tTR system is similar to the tetracycline-controlled transcriptional silencer (tTS), which was originally developed to repress basal
tetO promoter activity by blocking reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator (rtTA) in the absence of doxycyline (dox) (Freundlieb
et al., 1999). tTS doesn’t bind to rtTA because it is not intended to interrupt rtTA’s induction activity in the presence of dox. tTR was
designed and generated by replacing the transcription activator domain of tTA with NLS and KRAB transcription suppressor domains
(underlined in the following sequence) so that it could form a tTA-tTR heterodimer and effectively repress tTA activity. The amino acid
sequence of tTR is as follows:

 Generation of ChAT-tTR-nmNGx3 and VGluT1-tTR-nmNGx3 KI mice
tTR fused with P2A at the N terminus, T2A at the C terminus, and BGH polyA were synthesized and cloned into the pENTR vector
(ThermoFisher, USA) to make pENTR-2A-tTR. mNeonGreen (Allele Biotechnology, U.S.A.) with an NLS at the N terminus and two
mNeonGreen were amplified and fused tandemly into nmNGx3. Then, nmNGx3 was cloned into the EcoRI site of the pENTR-2A-
tTR vector by ligation. Destination vectors for targeting into the C terminus of the cholinergic marker gene choline acetyltransferase
(ChAT) and the glutamatergic marker gene vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGluT1) were constructed as follows:
Right-homology arms were amplified by PCR with the primers listed: forward primer for ChAT (50-ggctcgatccctcgagttgggggctca
catgaagctgg-30), reverse primer for ChAT (50-cgggaattcgatgatatcgaatgcatcactgcttcaaacaactgtc-30), forward primer for VGluT1
(50-ggctcgatccctcgaggcctgagcggcagtgtcgagg-30), and reverse primer for VGluT1 (50-cgggaattcgatgatatcgagcagagaaactgaggtgca
gac-30). The PCR products were inserted into the XhoI and EcoRV digested back-bone vector pTVCI3 (Tainaka et al., 2014) using
the In-Fusion HD Cloning Kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc. A Takara Bio Company, Japan). Left-homology arms were amplified
by PCR with primers as listed: forward primer for ChAT (50-tagggataacagggtaatatagaggtgacagcaggattggaagtg-30), reverse primer
for ChAT (50-gcggagaaagaggtaatgaaatgggcgtgggagtagtcaagattgcttgg-30), forward primer for VGluT1 (50-tagggataacagggtaata
tagccctcgctatgccagcatcttg-30), and reverse primer for VGluT1 (50-gcggagaaagaggtaatgaaatgggcgtagtcccggacagggggcg-30). The
products of first PCR for the left-homology arms were amplified with primers (50-gcagttacgctagggataacagggtaatatag-30 and 50-gat
catctatgtcgggtgcggagaaagaggtaatgaaatgg-30) and inserted into the I-SceI and PI-SceI digested pTVCI3-Rarm using the In-Fusion
HD Cloning Kit. The puromycin resistance gene cassette (P(PGK)-PuroR-polyA) was inserted into I-CeuI and PI-PspI digested
pTVCI3-LRarm.
Targeting, screening, and injection were performed according to the procedures described previously (Ode et al., 2017b; Ukai
et al., 2017).
Triple-target CRISPR: gRNA synthesis
The target sequences for Chrna2, Chrna4, Chrna5, Chrna6, Chrna7, Chrna9, Chrna10, Chrnb2, Chrnb3, Chrnb4 (Figures S5A–S5J),
Chrm1 (set 1 and 2), Chrm2, Chrm3 (set 1 and 2), Chrm4, and Chrm5 (Figures S6A–S6E, S6K, and S6L) were designed using the
on-line CRISPR guide RNA Design tool (Ma et al., 2013) or the mm10 CRISPR/Cas9 database (Sunagawa et al., 2016) (http://
crispr.riken.jp/). Possible off-target sequences within the mouse genome for each target sequence were checked using the CRISPR
Design Tool (Ran et al., 2013) (http://tools.genome-engineering.org).
Guide RNA (gRNA) synthesis was performed using the same protocol described in the previous report (Sunagawa et al., 2016). The
gRNA templates were directly synthesized and fused to the T7 promoter by PCR. First, partial fragments of the gRNA templates
including each target sequence were amplified from the pX330 plasmids (Addgene, #42230) (Cong et al., 2013; Ran et al., 2013)
by PCR with the common reverse primer (50-aaaagcaccgactcggtgcc-30; Hokkaido System Science, Japan or Fasmac, Japan)
(Wang et al., 2013) and forward primer-1 for each target sequence (Table S2A, Hokkaido System Science, or Fasmac). Subsequently,
the T7 promoter-fused gRNA templates were amplified from the diluted PCR products by PCR with the common reverse primer and
forward primer-2 for each target sequence (Table S2A, Hokkaido System Science, or Fasmac). The T7 promoter-fused gRNA PCR
fragments were used as a template for in vitro transcription using the MEGAshortscript T7 kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, U.S.A.).
The gRNAs were purified using the MEGAclear kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, U.S.A.).
Triple-target CRISPR: Cas9 mRNA synthesis
Cas9 mRNAs were synthesized with the same protocol described in the previous report (Sunagawa et al., 2016). The p3s-Cas9HC
plasmid (Cho et al., 2013) (Addgene, #43945), which includes a T7 promoter-fused Cas9 coding region, was digested with XbaI
(Takara Bio Inc., Japan), and used as the template for in vitro transcription using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 kit (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, MA, U.S.A.). The Cas9 mRNA was purified using the MEGAclear kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, U.S.A.).
Triple-target CRISPR: One-cell embryo microinjection
One-cell embryo microinjection was conducted by the same protocol described in the previous report (Sunagawa et al., 2016).
C57BL/6N females (4–6 weeks old, CLEA Japan Inc) were superovulated and mated with C57BL/6N males (CLEA Japan Inc., Japan).
Fertilized eggs were collected from the ampulla of the oviduct of plugged C57BL/6N females by micro-dissection, and maintained in
KSOM medium (Merck, Germany or ARK Resource, Japan) in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37�C. Cas9 mRNA (100 ng/mL) and gRNAs
(150 ng/mL in total) were co-injected into the cytoplasm of fertilized eggs in M2 medium (Merck Millipore or ARK Resource) at
room temperature (23–25�C). Details of the cytoplasmic injection were reported previously (Sumiyama et al., 2010). After microinjec-
tion, the embryos were cultured for 1 h in KSOM medium (Merck, Germany or ARK Resource, Japan) in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37�C,
and 25–35 embryos were then transferred to the oviducts of pseudopregnant female ICR mice.
Triple-target CRISPR: Genotyping of KO mice and ESCs by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and sequencing
Genotyping of KO mice was conducted with the same protocol described in the previous report (Sunagawa et al., 2016). Genomic
DNA of wild-type and KO mice was prepared from their tails using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (QIAGEN, Germany), according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. qPCR for genotyping was performed using the ABI PRISM 7900/QuantStudio 7 Flex (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, MA, U.S.A.) and the SYBR Premix Ex Taq GC (Takara Bio Inc., Japan). Primers for qPCR (Table S2B, Hokkaido System
e3
Cell Reports 24, 2231–2247.e1–e7, August 28, 2018
 Science, or Fasmac) were annealed to the targeting sequences. The absolute target site abundance was calculated using a standard
curve obtained from wild-type genomic DNA. The amount of Tbp (Tsujino et al., 2013) was quantified and used as an internal control.
When we could not confirm KO genotype by qPCR, we performed sequencing or a second qPCR using alternative primers, which
were independent of first qPCR.
Establishment of Chrm1/3 dKO ES cell
One-cell embryo, Cas9 mRNA, and gRNAs were prepared as described above. Cas9 mRNA (100 ng/mL) and gRNAs (150 ng/mL in
total) were co-injected into the cytoplasm of 200 fertilized eggs in M2 medium (Merck Millipore, MA, U.S.A. or ARK Resource, Japan)
at room temperature (23–25�C) as described above. After microinjection, the embryos were cultured for 2 days in KSOM medium
(Merck Millipore, MA, U.S.A. or ARK Resource, Japan) in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37�C.
On the next day of injection, mitotic-inactivated MEFs were seeded into the wells of 1% gelatin-coated 4-well plates (1.5 3 105
cells/well) with mouse ES medium. The next day, ES medium was replaced with 3i medium, and the plates were incubated for at least
30 min at 37�C in 5% CO2 before use.
Two days after injection, 50 embryos that had developed to the 8-cell stage or later were transferred into 3i-culture medium on the
feeder-coated dish. Embryos were incubated at 37�C in 5% CO2 without replacing the medium for 10 days or more, until a lump-like
ES colony (primary colony) appeared.
On the day before proceeding to the next step, BIO medium-treated amine-coated wells (24-well plate), one well for each colony,
were prepared. After incubation of the BIO-containing plates overnight at 37�C in 5% CO2, BIO-medium was replaced with 3i-culture
medium, and then the plates were incubated at 37�C in 5% CO2.
After confirming proliferation of the primary colony, culture medium was replaced with fresh 3i medium (pre-warmed to 37�C) and
incubation continued for 3 h at 37�C in 5% CO2. After washing the colony with PBS(-), trypsinized cells derived from each colony were
harvested, and transferred into the BIO medium-treated amine-coated well containing 3i-culture medium. After cultivation for several
days at 37�C in 5% CO2 without replacing the medium, the colonies were cloned, expanded, stored, and used for genomic DNA
extraction (Ode et al., 2017b; Ukai et al., 2017).
The sex of the ES clones was determined by PCR on the Sry gene with the following primers: Sry-F, 50-ccatgtcaagcgccccatga-30;
Sry-R, 50-gtaaggcttttccacctgca-30 (Hokkaido System Science, Japan or Fasmac, Japan). Genotyping by qPCR was performed as
described above. The KO-ESC clones were injected in 8-cell-stage embryos and chimerism confirmed according to a previously re-
ported protocol (Ode et al., 2017b; Ukai et al., 2017).
Sleep measurement with SSS
SSS recording and analysis were carried out according to the protocol described previously (Sunagawa et al., 2016). One set of data
recording in the SSS chamber was for one week. During the experiment, neither the chamber nor the rack was opened except for the
sleep-deprivation experiment. The light condition of the SSS rack was set to the LD (12:12 light-dark) or the DD (constant dark) con-
dition, and food and water were given ad libitum. For data analysis, six days from the second recording date were used. The control
dataset of C57BL/6N wild-type mice were shared among different groups of mutant mice for analysis (Table S3).
Sleep parameters, such as sleep duration, amplitude, PWS, and PSW were defined previously (Sunagawa et al., 2016). For the pre-
sent study, the definition of transition probabilities are as follows: The PWS and PSW represent different probabilities in regard to the
direction of wake/sleep transition. For example, when a mouse shows a long sleep phonotype, its PWS (transition probability from
wake to sleep) tends to be large while the PSW (transition probability from wake to sleep) tends to be small. More precisely, PWS
is defined as PWS = NWS/(NWS+NWW) where NWS and NWW are the numbers of transition in the direction from wake to sleep and
wake to wake (i.e., stay in wake), respectively, in the observed period. On the other hand, PSW is defined as NSW/(NSW+NSS) where
NSW and NSS are the numbers of transition in the direction from sleep to wake and sleep to sleep (i.e., stay in sleep), respectively, in the
observed period. Similarly, PWW and PSS can also be defined. According to these definitions, it can be noticed that PSW + PSS = 1 and
PWS + PWW = 1. Therefore, PSW and PWS reflect, in addition to the aforementioned wake/sleep propensities, the stabilities of sleep
(PSS) and wake (PWW), respectively (Sunagawa et al., 2016).
Sleep measurement with EEG and EMG recordings
Telemetry EEG and EMG recording devices (DSI, MN, U.S.A.) were implanted into mice more than 10 days before recording. Further
information on implantation of telemetry devices been described previously (Sunagawa et al., 2013). For the sleep staging, we used
the FASTER method to automatically annotate EEG and EMG data (Sunagawa et al., 2013), and then the result of the FASTER anno-
tation was corrected by visual inspection. In the automated staging of the FASTER method, EEG and EMG data were divided into 8 s
segments (epochs), and each epoch was detrended by subtracting a linear trend, which was estimated by the least-squares linear
regression. The power spectrum of the epoch was obtained by FFT with the Hann window. Both data arrays of the power spectrum of
EEG and EMG from the same epoch were concatenated into a single array, and then the concatenated array of spectrum data was
subjected to principal component analysis. The top four principal components were used for the subsequent clustering which was
performed by the pdfCluster library (Azzalini and Menardi, 2014; Azzalini and Torelli, 2007). To reduce computational load for
Cell Reports 24, 2231–2247.e1–e7, August 28, 2018
e4
 clustering, the epochs of a whole time series were divided into subsets of epochs so that each subset was comprised of 5400 epochs,
and within each subset, clusters were produced. The produced clusters were annotated by the following rules: First, the median log-
arithm of EMG power of each cluster was computed and clusters that have higher median logarithm of EMG power than the 0.5 quar-
tiles of that of all data points were annotated as ‘Wake’. Within the remaining non-wake clusters, median logarithm of EEG delta
power (0.5–4 Hz) was calculated, and if it was greater than 0.1 quartile of EEG delta power among all non-wake data points, it
was annotated as ‘NREM sleep’ and the rest of the clusters were annotated as ‘REM sleep’.
In manual scoring, each epoch was staged by visual inspection as NREM, REM, and Wake by the following criteria: An epoch was
staged as NREM sleep when it was characterized by high-amplitude EEG waves with low-frequency (0.5–4 Hz by visual inspection)
dominance and very low amplitude of EMG signal. The stage of REM sleep was assigned when an epoch was characterized by low-
amplitude EEG wave with a relatively high-frequency fluctuation (6–10 Hz by visual inspection) and very low EMG power. The stage of
Wake was assigned when an epoch was characterized by high amplitude EMG signal.
Transition probabilities among wakefulness, NREM sleep, and REM sleep (Figures 6C, 6F, and 6G) were calculated in a similar way
to PSW described in the above section (Sleep measurement with SSS). For example, the transition probability from NREM sleep to
wakefulness is defined as PNW = NNW/(NNW + NNR + NNN) where Nmn is defined as a number of transitions from state m to n (m,n 4
{wakefulness, NREM sleep, REM sleep}) in the observed period. Notably, in the EEG and EMG recordings, there are theoretically
eight possible transitions, however, we did not take into account the transition from wakefulness to REM sleep because the transition
usually does not occur in mice.
The power spectrum density for Figures 7 and S7 was calculated for each epoch by fast Fourier transformation (FFT) with Welch’s
averaging method (Hayes, 1996). Briefly, each 8 s segment (800 data points as the sampling frequency was at 100 Hz) was further
divided into eight overlapping sequences. The length of overlap was 50% of each sequence. Hamming window was applied onto the
sequences prior to the FFT and the obtained spectrum was averaged over the eight sequences. The dirty segments were excluded
from the subsequent processes (Sunagawa et al., 2013). The power spectrum of each behavioral state was calculated by averaging
the power spectral densities of segments within each state over the first three days of the observation period.
Visual inspection on behaviors
Two mutant mice and two control mice used in Figure 6M were randomly selected and subjected to video recordings in parallel with
EEG and EMG recordings. EEG power spectrum was produced in the FASTER method (Sunagawa et al., 2013). The EEG theta-oscil-
lation dominant periods were extracted by calculating the ratio of EEG-theta power (6-10 Hz) to delta power (0.5-4 Hz) for each epoch
(EEG data with time length of 8 s). Mean and SD of the theta/delta ratios were obtained for each 12-hour interval just before and just
after the sleep-deprivation for individual mice. The timestamp of epoch was reported when its theta/delta ratio exceeded the
threshold of mean + 5 SD, and the associated videos were visually inspected. The inspection covered the 30-hour period prior to
and 12-hour period subsequent to the sleep-deprivation. The timestamps of transition from NREM sleep to wakefulness were ex-
tracted according to annotated stages.
Sleep deprivation with SSS
Mice were sleep deprived for 1, 2, 4, and 6 h by automated shaker (NR-40, TAITEC, Japan) in a different breeding rack from the one
used for SSS recordings. The shaking speed was at around 120–130 rpm, and shaking method was alternatively switched between
reciprocal and rotary every two hours. Every duration of sleep deprivation (SD) ended at ZT12. After SD, mice were returned to the
SSS rack and recorded for 2 days.
Sleep deprivation with EEG and EMG recordings
Mice were implanted with EEG and EMG probes and sleep deprived for 6 h (ZT6-12) by the gentle touch of a brush.
X-gal staining and fluorescent imaging of Tet reporter mice
X-gal staining of Tet reporter mice was performed as reported previously with minor modifications (Imayoshi et al., 2006). Briefly,
fresh samples of adult mice brain were sliced into 400 mm sections, fixed in 2% formaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS so-
lution for 1 h at 4�C, rinsed twice in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB) (pH 7.4), 2 mM MgCl2, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% NP-40,
and stained at 37�C for 4 h in X-gal stain buffer (2 mg/mL X-gal, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% NP-40, 5 mM
K3Fe(CN)6, 5 mM K4Fe(CN)6 in 0.1 M PB). Stained samples were washed twice in PBS and post-fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 2 h
at room temperature (23–25�C).
Fluorescent imaging of Tet reporter mice was performed as reported previously (Susaki et al., 2014). Each fixed brain was
immersed in 10 g of CUBIC reagent-1 at 37�C with gentle shaking for 3 days, then the solution was exchanged, and the sample
immersed in the same volume of fresh reagent-1 for an additional 3–4 days. The treated brain was washed with PBS several times
at room temperature (23–25�C) with gentle shaking, immersed in 20% (w/v) sucrose in PBS, degassed, and immersed in reagent-2
(10 g per brain) for 3–7 days. After imaging, the sample was washed again with PBS, immersed in 20% (w/v) sucrose in PBS, and
stored in O.C.T. compound at �80�C. Fluorescence images were acquired with an LSFM (Ultramicroscope, LaVision BioTec, Ger-
many) as described in the previous report (Susaki et al., 2014).

Cell Reports 24, 2231–2247.e1–e7, August 28, 2018
 For each brain sample of CUBIC analysis, 3D NIfTI-1 files were generated from the Z stacks acquired in the dorsal-ventral (DV) and
ventral-dorsal (VD) directions, merged, and registered as described previously (Susaki et al., 2014; Susaki et al., 2015). We normal-
ized the tdTomato signals and used the NIfTI-1 images aligned to the Allen Brain Atlas (Lein et al., 2007) to extract only pixels located
inside the brain. We calculated the median intensity of these pixels for each brain and normalized the data so that all brain samples
had the same median intensity.
Activated cells were detected in the image stack using Fiji software (Schindelin et al., 2012). For each horizontal slice of a given
brain sample, we started by subtracting the background (rolling ball radius: 2 pixels). We then calculated a Gaussian blur (sigma: 2)
and subtracted from the image in order to preserve only the signal of interest. We then successively ran the ‘‘setThreshold’’ (with
parameters 800, 65536), ‘‘Threshold,’’ and ‘‘Analyze Particles’’ (with size = 2–25, circularity = 0.3–1.0) commands. The number of
activated cells in a brain sample was calculated as the sum of the number of cells identified in each of its slices.
When processing each slice, we also saved an image containing only the detected activated cells in order to reconstruct 3D images
of cell activation throughout the brain.
To analyze local patterns, we aligned these images to the brain atlas using the registration parameters calculated above. Analyzing
aligned samples meant that we did not have access to single-cell resolution, and the Fiji-based cell detection method could not be
applied. However, it was previously shown that the intensity of the extracted signal could be used to estimate the number of activated
cells with R2 z0.95 (Tatsuki et al., 2016).
We extracted the detected signal corresponding to this specific region in the Allen Brain Atlas. To filter out noise, we focused on
regions with a non-zero signal in at least 3 of the 9 brains. For these regions, hierarchical clustering was performed in R (R Develop-
ment Core Team, 2016). We identified a cluster of 99 regions (out of the 1203 regions defined on the reference atlas) with no (or close
to no) signal in TrkA-tTA(-);tetO-tdTomato(+) brains, and reliable signal in TrkA-tTA(+);tetO-tdTomato(+) brains. For this cluster, we
generated a whole-brain mask to extract and reconstruct a 3D image of the cell signal specific to these 99 regions.
In situ hybridization
Probes against TrkA, Ngfr, and ChAT were amplified from mouse brain cDNA (C57BL6/N, male), and Egfp and mNeonGreen were
amplified from plasmids by PCR. Probes against VGluT1 (kindly provided by Dr. Kazunari Miyamichi) were amplified from mouse
brain cDNA (first strand cDNA mouse brain MD01, GenoStaff). All the probe fragments were cloned into pCR-BluntII-TOPO vector
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, U.S.A.) for storage, and in vitro transcription (IVT) templates were generated by PCR using the cloned
vector. All primers used for cloning and IVT reactions are listed in Table S1. Probe labeling and purification were conducted using the
same protocol described in the previous paper (Tatsuki et al., 2016). Probes for ChAT-1 and ChAT-2 were mixed before hybridization.
For fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), mice were sacrificed at ZT5, and the brain was used for the same procedures
described previously (Tatsuki et al., 2016).
For NBT-BCIP staining, mice were sacrificed at ZT5, and the same procedures were performed until the blocking step of the FISH
protocol. After blocking, the sections were incubated with the blocking buffer containing anti-Dig-Fab-AP (Merck, Germany;
#11093274910, 1:1000) overnight at 4�C. The next day, the sections were washed three times in PBS containing 0.3% Triton
X-100 (PBST) for 10 min each, then incubated in NTMT solution (50 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.5), 1%
Tween-20) for 5 min, and incubated in NTMT solution containing NBT/BCIP stock solution (Merck, Germany; 1:50) for 4–5 days at
4�C. The sections were incubated in TE buffer for 5 min and embedded with 80% glycerol.
Images of in situ hybridization samples were acquired with a BX51 inverted confocal microscope (Olympus, Japan). A series of
images covering all areas of a section were acquired and stitched with the pairwise stitching plugin of ImageJ (Preibisch et al., 2009).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical analyses were performed by Microsoft Excel for Mac version 15.40, R version 3.1.0., Wolfram Mathematica version 9.0.1.0,
11.2.0.0.
For paired samples, the normality was tested by Shapiro test at a significance level of 0.05. When normality was not rejected in both
groups, the homogeneity of variance was tested by F-test at a significance level of 0.05. When the null hypothesis of normal distri-
bution with equal variance for the two groups was not rejected, a Student’s paired t test was used, otherwise a two-sample Wilcoxon t
test was applied.
For unpaired two samples, the means of two sets of data were evaluated. The normality was tested by the Shapiro test at a sig-
nificance level of 0.05. When the normality was not rejected in both groups, the homogeneity of variance was tested by F-test at a
significance level of 0.05. When the null hypothesis of normal distribution with equal variance for the two groups was not rejected, a
Student’s t test was used. When the normality was not rejected but the null hypothesis of equal variance was rejected, a Welch’s t test
was used. Otherwise, a two-sample Wilcoxon test was applied.
For comparing more than two samples (i.e., CRISPR mutant mice) against identical one sample (i.e., C57BL/6N control mice), data
means were evaluated. The normality was tested by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test at a significance level of 0.05. When the normality
was not rejected in all groups, the homogeneity of variance was tested by Bartlett’s test at a significance level of 0.05. When the null

 hypothesis of normal distribution with equal variance was not rejected for all groups, Dunnett’s test was used, otherwise the Steel test
was applied.
In this study, p < 0.05 was considered significant (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, and n.s. for not significant).
