Abstract
The global impact of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) continues to increase, and focused efforts are needed to address this
immense public health challenge. National leaders have set a goal to prevent or effectively treat AD by 2025. In this
paper, we discuss the path to 2025, and what is feasible in this time frame given the realities and challenges of AD
drug development, with a focus on disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). Under the current conditions, only drugs
currently in late Phase 1 or later will have a chance of being approved by 2025. If pipeline attrition rates remain
high, only a few compounds at best will meet this time frame. There is an opportunity to reduce the time and
risk of AD drug development through an improvement in trial design; better trial infrastructure; disease registries
of well-characterized participant cohorts to help with more rapid enrollment of appropriate study populations;
validated biomarkers to better detect disease, determine risk and monitor disease progression as well as predict
disease response; more sensitive clinical assessment tools; and faster regulatory review. To implement change
requires efforts to build awareness, educate and foster engagement; increase funding for both basic and clinical
research; reduce fragmented environments and systems; increase learning from successes and failures; promote
data standardization and increase wider data sharing; understand AD at the basic biology level; and rapidly
translate new knowledge into clinical development. Improved mechanistic understanding of disease onset and
progression is central to more efficient AD drug development and will lead to improved therapeutic approaches
and targets. The opportunity for more than a few new therapies by 2025 is small. Accelerating research and
clinical development efforts and bringing DMTs to market sooner would have a significant impact on the future
societal burden of AD. As these steps are put in place and plans come to fruition, e.g., approval of a DMT, it can
be predicted that momentum will build, the process will be self-sustaining, and the path to 2025, and beyond,
becomes clearer.

Background
Increasing life expectancy has produced a dramatic rise
in the prevalence, and thus impact, of aging-associated
diseases including dementia. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is
by far the most common dementia in late life. It is cur-
rently estimated that 46.8 million people worldwide have
dementia with an estimated global cost of dementia care
at US$818 billion in 2010 [1]. By 2030 it is estimated
that there will be 74.7 million people with dementia, and
the cost of caring for these individuals could rise to
some US$2 trillion. In the absence of effective therapies,
the estimated number of people with dementia will
reach 131.5 million by 2050.
Global leaders have set a deadline of 2025 for find-
ing an effective way to treat or prevent AD [2]. In the
United States in late 2010/early 2011, the National
Alzheimer’s Project Act (NAPA) was passed and signed
into law [3]. It required the creation of a national strategic
plan to address the rapidly escalating AD crisis and the co-
ordination of AD efforts across the federal government.
The overarching research goal of the project is to “prevent
or effectively treat Alzheimer’s disease by 2025”. In
December 2014, the G8 stated that dementia should be
made a global priority with the aim of a cure or approved
disease-modifying therapy (DMT) available by 2025.

 Although the politically initiated 2025 deadline may not
have been based on scientific principles of disease research
or the realities of drug development, it has become a rally-
ing cry for researchers and advocates as they endeavor to
find innovative ways to develop drugs to successfully
achieve the 2025 goal.
Despite the evaluation of numerous potential treat-
ments in clinical trials [4, 5], only four cholinesterase in-
hibitors and memantine have shown sufficient safety and
efficacy to allow marketing approval at an international
level. These five agents are symptomatic treatments,
temporarily ameliorating memory and thinking prob-
lems, and their clinical effect is modest; they do not treat
the underlying cause of AD and do not slow the rate of
decline [6].
Over the past decade, the focus of drug discovery and
development efforts has shifted toward DMTs for AD;
that is, treatments whose aim is to affect the underlying
disease process by impacting one or more of the many
brain changes characteristic of AD. These treatments
could slow the progression of the disease or delay its on-
set. Less encouraging is that, over the same time period,
numerous candidate agents have failed in clinical devel-
opment, and no DMTs have shown a drug-placebo
difference in Phase 3 studies or received marketing
approval [7].
While AD drug failures to date are likely, in part, be-
cause the drugs tested lacked sufficient target engage-
ment or had toxic effects [8], efforts to bring new AD
drugs to market have been hindered by a number of
challenges—incomplete understanding of AD pathogen-
esis, the multifactorial etiology and complex pathophysi-
ology of the disease, the slowly progressive nature of
AD, and the high level of comorbidity occurring in the
elderly population [9]. Further challenges exist in the
clinical trial environment because overt clinical symp-
toms are not evident until considerable change has oc-
curred within the brain, the most appropriate outcome
measures have not been widely agreed upon, there is dif-
ficulty establishing and coordinating global clinical trial
networks, and strategies for identifying and recruiting
trial participants are time- and cost-intensive [10]. As we
move to treating earlier in the disease continuum, there
is more sensitivity around risk associated with drug use;
drug failures may be the result of studying too low a
dose in an effort to decrease the occurrence of side ef-
fects, including amyloid-related imaging abnormalities
(ARIA), which are still poorly understood.
In this paper, we discuss the path to 2025, and what is
feasible in this time frame given the realities and chal-
lenges of AD drug development. We focus on develop-
ment of DMTs for individuals with early disease, which
may be more amenable to disease modification and most
likely to fulfill the 2025 mandate of meaningful new
therapy. Early disease is defined here as mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) due to AD (National Institute on
Aging-Alzheimer’s Association (NIA-AA) criteria [11])
or prodromal AD (International Working Group (IWG)
criteria [12]). Clinical study of individuals with preclin-
ical AD (asymptomatic persons at increased risk for
symptomatic AD) are being pursued but their longer
time frames and measurement and regulatory uncer-
tainty makes them less likely to contribute to reaching
the 2025 goal; this topic is not discussed in depth here,
but it is recognized that the challenges are likely to be
similar, though on a greater scale, to those associated
with development of treatments for MCI. Identifying
DMTs for use in preclinical populations will take longer
given uncertainties about disease progression, clinical
outcomes, biomarkers, and regulatory views.
We provide examples of current activities and prac-
tices to help address these complex challenges and
briefly discuss activities that need to start now but may
not have direct impact until after 2025. We intend to set
the stage for continuing progress in the AD drug devel-
opment field, and to stimulate further discussion and ac-
tion for impact in the short term to fulfill the 2025 goal
and long term for continuing development in the AD
space beyond 2025.
AD drug development—current status
For a DMT, after preclinical development and initial
characterization of an AD agent, Phase 1 takes approxi-
mately 13 months, Phase 2 approximately 28 months,
and Phase 3 approximately 51 months, followed by
regulatory review of approximately 18 months [13]. In-
cluding preclinical development, the total development
time reaches 160 months (more than 9 years). The cost
of developing a DMT for AD, including the cost of fail-
ures, is estimated at $5.7 billion in the current environ-
ment [13].
To determine if availability of DMTs by 2025 is a real-
istic goal, we can work backwards from 2025 (Fig. 1). If
the current timeline remains unchanged, approval of a
DMT by 2025 requires that the agent be under regula-
tory review by 2023/2024. Thus, Phase 3 studies will
need to start by 2019 to allow sufficient time for recruit-
ment, treatment in trial and analysis/interpretation, and
Phase 2 will need to start in 2016/2017. Therefore, for
approval by 2025, potential AD DMTs need to be in late
Phase 1 now, and most compounds with a chance of
success by 2025 will currently be in Phase 2 or 3.
The number of DMTs in clinical trials is small consider-
ing the need. Currently in Phase 1 through Phase 3
development, there are approximately five active immuno-
therapies, 11 passive immunotherapies, and 55 small
molecules (including but not limited to DMTs) [14].
The main targets are amyloid, followed by inflammatory
Cummings et al. Alzheimer's Research & Therapy  (2016) 8:39 
Page 2 of 12
 mediators/factors and tau, and the dominant approach is
passive immunization targeting amyloid. Reviews of select
DMTs in development are provided by Scheltens et al.
[15] and Hendrix et al. [16]. Attrition is high, and few
compounds, at best, will be approved in the 2025 time
frame.
Accelerating AD drug development to 2025:
overcoming key challenges
Hastening new drug development with a view to imple-
menting drug treatment and prevention strategies by
2025 will require advances within the clinical trial set-
ting as well as progress in the regulatory environment.
We discuss specific measures that are needed in these
areas, and provide examples of where they are already
being implemented.
Clinical trial environment
Speeding up clinical development, particularly in Phase
2 and 3, requires innovations and improvements in study
design and trial execution, as well as more effective re-
cruitment measures and disease detection/monitoring.
Trial design and operation
Traditionally, individual study phases are completed be-
fore moving to the next phase of the study. However, as
has been the case in immunotherapy development, com-
bined Phase 1/2 clinical trials may speed development;
that is, instead of conducting a Phase 1 trial for toxicity
and a separate Phase 2 trial for efficacy, it may be appro-
priate to integrate these two phases into one study of in-
dividuals with AD. Study sponsors can consider an
adaptive Phase 2/3 study design, whereby accumulating
trial data are used to guide modification of one or more
specified aspects of the study design, for example redu-
cing the number of dose arms, or extending or shorten-
ing the length of the trial without undermining its
validity and integrity. Use of such an adaptive trial de-
sign places greater emphasis on Phase 2 learnings as
guides to pharmaceutical decision-making (for example,
whether to continue development of an investigational
drug). While AD drug development could be reduced by
months or even years using an adaptive design, there is
some skepticism about its value with concern of errone-
ous trial modifications as a result of the “noise” with our
current cognitive measures as well as with non-validated
biomarkers. Intensive study of novel study designs will
be required to understand their appropriate role within
the AD trial setting and potential for drug development
acceleration.
While the advance of a drug from Phase 2 to Phase 3
is a step closer to the goal, there is a risk of wasting
both time and money if this decision is based on sec-
ondary analysis and subgroup findings when the pri-
mary
endpoint
is
not
met
in
Phase
2.
Rigorous
adherence to pre-specified outcomes and avoidance of
over-interpreting subgroup data, as well as greater un-
derstanding of the test agent in Phase 2 and appropri-
ate primary endpoint selection, are crucial and will
help preserve resources for agents with a higher likeli-
hood of success.
Patient recruitment and enrollment are the most time-
consuming aspects of the clinical trial process and this is
particularly so for Phase 3 studies where sample sizes for
AD trials of DMTs are often more than 1000 partici-
pants. Recruitment to AD trials is notoriously slow, and
can take years for AD Phase 3 trials. Speeding up re-
cruitment is a key area where clinical development time-
lines could be impacted, reducing Phase 2 and Phase 3
study times by many months.
Efforts are needed to increase recruitment include
expanding public and healthcare professional (HCP) under-
standing of AD as well as increasing their awareness of op-
portunities for AD trial participation, whether in currently
recruiting trials or in future trials through voluntary inclu-
sion on AD registries. HCPs also need to be more informed
and prepared for screening of patients and referral to mem-
ory centers. Patient networks and advocacy groups will play
an increasingly important role in engaging the general
population and raising their awareness of AD and demen-
tia, as well as AD trial participation opportunities, for ex-
ample through the creation of more Dementia Friendly
Communities (DFCs) (e.g., The Heart Ring Movement
campaign in Japan, and The Dementia Friends program

 initiative launched by the Alzheimer’s Society in the UK).
This will be particularly important in countries where there
is currently a less enthusiastic attitude towards clinical trial
participation. Voices of politicians, entertainment celebri-
ties, sports figures, religious leaders, and other stakeholders
may ultimately be necessary to fully galvanize populations
into action.
To streamline enrollment in AD clinical trials and
speed up recruitment, registries of healthy aged and
symptomatic individuals are vital. As well as providing a
repository for information about people with a specific
condition,
registries
provide
a
connection
between
people who are willing to participate in research and
those recruiting for studies. More advanced registries
with standardized demographic, genetic, biologic, cogni-
tive, and environmental information on potential partici-
pants could reduce the length of clinical trials further
after the initial eligibility testing has been established.
The availability of serial assessment information within a
database could permit selection of trial participants
based on disease trajectory. The availability of a trial-
ready cohort in which both amyloid and cognitive status
are known could potentially provide the greatest time
saving in treatment development; however, the cost of
establishing such cohorts is significant. Finding mecha-
nisms to avoid “labeling” participants, ensuring security
and privacy of data, and respecting transgenerational
inferences are all key to development of successful
registries.
AD registries currently in place to help with more
effective recruitment to clinical trials include:
– The Alzheimer’s Prevention Registry [17]
– The Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network
Trials Unit (DIAN-TU) Expanded Registry [18], to
aid recruitment of individuals at risk of having a
gene mutation that causes dominantly inherited AD
to trials of potential DMTs;
– The Brain Health Registry [19], a global online
registry for anyone age 18 years and older interested
in research of new treatments for AD, and other
conditions that affect brain function (includes
opportunities for clinical trial participation);
– The Global Alzheimer’s Platform (GAP) initiative
[20, 21];
– The Cleveland Clinic Healthy Brains Registry
(healthybrains.org) [22];
– The Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS)
[23], a federal-university collaboration and also part
of the Alzheimer Prevention Initiative; and
– The Join Dementia Research initiative [24] in the UK.
Linking individual registries will further increase the po-
tential participant pool, and that is beginning to occur.
The Brain Health Registry has recently partnered with
GAP to dramatically increase the registry’s database size to
tens of thousands of new registry members; under the
joint effort, supporters hope to have 40,000 people regis-
tered before the end of 2016.
Other channels of recruitment, including community
screenings, advocacy forums, educational programs, so-
cial media campaigns, and use of conventional media
(television, radio, newspapers), can function to refer po-
tential participants to registries or directly to trial sites.
Trial execution can be far more efficient if there is an
integrated standing network of clinical trial sites. These
clinical trial platforms may include local disease regis-
tries, trial-ready cohorts, and optimized administrative
procedures, and they are increasingly being pursued as a
way to assure less redundancy (e.g., through acceptance
of a standardized budget and contract language and an-
nual rather than trial-specific rater training and certifica-
tion) and greater speed compared to the existing clinical
trial procedures. GAP, for example, hopes to reduce the
clinical testing cycle by 2 years or more through the de-
velopment of certified clinical trial sites and, as already
discussed, registries with cohorts of trial-ready patients.
Clinical trial execution is dependent upon Institutional
Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) approval,
and with multi-center trials this invariably means ap-
proval by numerous individual IRBs/ECs. The burden on
IRBs/ECs and on sponsors and clinical investigators who
are seeking review for multicenter trials is considerable;
there is unnecessary expense, duplication of effort, and
delays. Greater reliance on a centralized (even national)
IRB review process could reduce this time-consuming
problem.
Fostering stronger ties between clinical practice and
research could also speed trial recruitment and increase
trial efficiency. Comprehensive AD Centers, whereby
clinical activities and research efforts are brought to-
gether so that patient care and clinical study of AD can
occur in a more integrated environment, are being
established. Examples include: The Gérontopôle in
Toulouse, France [25]; the Salpêtrière Dementia Research
Center, in Paris, France; the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort
[26]; the German Dementia Competence Network [27];
the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health,
USA; and the University of Southern California Alzhei-
mer’s Therapeutic Research Institute (USC ATRI), USA.
Detection and monitoring of disease—clinical assessment
tools
As we shift clinical focus from the study of symptomatic
treatments in populations with more advanced disease to
DMTs in populations with earlier disease, several chal-
lenges arise with the use of currently available assessment
tools. While DMTs will potentially slow cognitive decline,
Cummings et al. Alzheimer's Research & Therapy  (2016) 8:39 
Page 4 of 12
 they may not provide immediate improvement like exist-
ing symptomatic treatments. Cognitive instruments, such
as the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive
subscale (ADAS-Cog), Mini-Mental State Examination
(MMSE), and neuropsychological test items show rela-
tively little change over time in individuals with early
symptoms of disease, primarily due to ceiling effects in
many of the items that make up these scales (i.e., there are
ceiling effects, and parts of the test do not properly cap-
ture subtle changes over time). In addition, since func-
tional worsening occurs later in the disease process and
seems to follow cognitive decline [28, 29], individuals with
no or minimal cognitive symptoms are likely to have no
functional compromise, limiting the relevance of func-
tional and global assessments.
There is a need for more sensitive and responsive in-
struments for use in these early stages of AD; in particu-
lar, more sensitive and specific cognitive assessment
tools to capture subtle clinical decline are required to
identify individuals with minimal symptoms and discern
treatment effects among participants with earlier disease.
As a result of the early involvement of the medial tem-
poral lobe in AD pathogenesis, a specific memory profile
has been reported in AD that is characterized by a
diminished free recall ability that is only marginally
improved by cueing (amnestic syndrome of the hippo-
campal type) [30]. The Free and Cued Selective Recall
Reminding Test (FCSRT) can be used to detect impair-
ment of free and cued recall and identify patients with
MCI with high sensitivity and specificity [31, 32]. Com-
puterized neuropsychological assessment may offer a
greater degree of sensitivity, and assessments can be per-
formed more frequently so within-subject changes can
be detected more easily. Unfortunately, computer ex-
perience can influence computerized test performance
and this is likely to be more of a challenge in elderly in-
dividuals. Exploration of these emerging alternatives
may lead to new standard assessments in the AD trial
environment.
Functional assessment remains a key challenge in AD
drug development, and more sensitive tools to assess
deficits in function are urgently needed. Function is
commonly assessed using Activities of Daily Living
(ADL) measurement instruments. ADL is divided into
Basic Activities of Daily Living (BADL), which includes
self-maintenance skills such as bathing, dressing or eat-
ing, and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL),
which involves more complex activities such as using
public transportation, managing finances, or shopping.
These instrumental activities generally require a greater
complexity of neuropsychological organization and are
therefore likely to be vulnerable to the early effects of
cognitive decline. Although there is incomplete agree-
ment about which IADL domains are typically impaired
in prodromal AD and which types of instruments may
detect those best, it is clear that activities requiring
higher cognitive processes are the most consistently af-
fected items. New instruments for assessment of IADL
functioning including items measuring the domains of
financial capacities, keeping appointments, task comple-
tion time, decision making, speed of performance, and
task accuracy [33] are needed.
Development and validation of new scales de novo is a
long process. Recent efforts have focused on developing
composites, which capture only those components from
existing scales that have the ability to discern decline in
early AD populations; for example, by eliminating items
from the ADAS-Cog that appear less sensitive to early
changes and combining the remainder with items from
other instruments of cognition and/or function, sensitivity
to change and reduced variability can be achieved. The
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also indicated
that a single composite outcome may be appropriate for
trials of individuals with MCI/prodromal AD [34]. Com-
posites for the study of individuals with MCI include the
integrated Alzheimer’s Disease Rating Scale (iADRS) [35],
comprised of the scores from two widely accepted mea-
sures, the ADAS-Cog and the ADCS-instrumental Activ-
ities
of
Daily
Living
(ADCS-iADL),
and
the
AD
Composite Score (ADCOMS) [36], comprised of four
ADAS-Cog items, two MMSE items, and all six Clinical
Dementia
Rating-Sum
of
Boxes
(CDR-SB)
items.
ADCOMS which has been demonstrated to have im-
proved sensitivity to clinical decline over individual
scales in individuals with earlier symptoms of AD.
New tools are also needed for preclinical AD trials. The
ADCS-Preclinical
Alzheimer
Cognitive
Composite
(ADCS-PACC) is a cognitive composite and the pri-
mary outcome measure in the Anti-Amyloid Treatment
in Asymptomatic AD (A4) Trial of individuals with pr
eclinical AD [37]. Other instruments for preclinical tri-
als are being assessed.
Ultimately, the goal is to ensure that any assessment
tool employed provides clinically meaningful informa-
tion. In studies of populations with early AD symptoms,
it might be appropriate to consider cognition alone as a
primary endpoint, and this may require a better under-
standing of the clinical meaningfulness of cognitive
changes and their ability to predict functional decline. A
composite composed of appropriate cognitive and func-
tional components would also be of use. More sensitive
tools, whether cognitive or functional, could help speed
clinical development by shortening recruitment time
and reducing the required sample size.
Detection and monitoring of disease—biomarkers
Biomarkers have become instrumental in efficient clin-
ical development of drug entities for many diseases,
Cummings et al. Alzheimer's Research & Therapy  (2016) 8:39 
Page 5 of 12
 assisting with appropriate patient selection, testing target
engagement by a drug, and monitoring disease progres-
sion. In the AD field, biomarkers will be essential to
speed clinical development.
Diagnostic AD markers are considered those reflect-
ive of AD pathology. In this realm, the focus thus far
has been on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers— Aβ42
and tau (total tau or phosphorylated tau)— and posi-
tron emission tomography (PET) imaging with amyloid
or tau tracers to provide information on the extent of
amyloid plaque burden or tau neurofibrillary tangles in
the brain [12, 38]. Use of diagnostic markers is essential
to ensure enrollment of individuals who have AD
pathology; clinical diagnosis alone of AD dementia is
not always accurate. Approximately 25 % of subjects di-
agnosed clinically with mild AD dementia have been
shown to be amyloid-negative [39] and the proportion
is even higher in MCI [40]. Diagnostic biomarkers,
however, need to be inexpensive and simpler to use if
they are to be widely integrated. Topographical bio-
markers are used to identify downstream brain changes
indicative of AD pathology (brain regional structural
and metabolic changes) [12]. They include magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI)-related biomarkers, for ex-
ample structural MRI to assess hippocampal atrophy,
ventricular volume, whole brain volume, and cortical
thickness. While useful as disease progression markers
in trials, they lack the specificity of diagnostic markers
and may not be helpful in early stages of disease.
In light of the challenges with clinical endpoints and the
protracted and unpredictable clinical course of AD, it is
crucial to have access to surrogate biomarkers that could
provide an early indication that a drug is having an effect
that will ultimately lead to cognitive and functional im-
provements; no qualified surrogates for AD trials are cur-
rently available. The use of surrogate markers would make
clinical trials of potential DMTs more efficient. Their use
would enable better decisions about which compounds
(from a number of closely related candidates) to advance
and at what dosage, thus reducing the overall risk of fail-
ure. The more clinical trials that incorporate potential sur-
rogates, the sooner the discovery and qualification of a
surrogate marker can be expected. Once it is known that
a surrogate endpoint predicts clinical benefit, the surro-
gate endpoint may be used to support additional ap-
provals. Establishment of surrogate status for biomarkers
takes years; as a result, they are unlikely to be available to
assist reaching the 2025 goal.
A target engagement biomarker helps determine whether
the study drug has engaged its target in the disease process
and thus has the opportunity to produce a clinical benefit.
They are most useful for eliminating compounds that have
inadequate engagement to effect a clinical change, thus
freeing resources to invest in more promising agents. Their
use in Phase 2 would help eliminate ineffective drugs so
that failures in Phase 3 are reduced.
Repurposed drugs
Repurposed agents are drugs that have been approved for
another indication but may have pharmacological effects
relevant to the treatment of AD [41]. Repurposed agents
with possible effects in AD include, but are not limited to,
statins, anti-hypertensives, cancer treatment agents, and
anticonvulsants [42–44]. Repurposed agents have the po-
tential of accelerating the AD drug development timeline.
They have already been through preclinical toxicology as-
sessments; Phase 1 human safety, tolerability and pharma-
cokinetic assessments; Phase 2 safety and efficacy studies
for the original indication; Phase 3 studies for the original
indication, and regulatory review for the original indica-
tion. Development of a repurposed agent for use in the
AD field could begin with a Phase 2 proof-of-concept and
dosing study for AD, thus avoiding the time and expense
of preclinical development and Phase 1. Challenges do
exist, however. While safety and tolerability of these drugs
are well known, they will not have been used in AD popu-
lations where vulnerabilities may differ. In addition, many
of these agents have no or limited patent protection and
intellectual property challenges may decrease the interest
of pharma in investing in their development [45]. This al-
ternate pathway for AD drug development has promise
but is not likely to have a major impact on the 2025 AD
treatment goal.
Regulatory environment
With a shift in the focus of AD drug development to
earlier stages of disease, both the FDA and the Euro-
pean Medicines Agency (EMA) are putting increasing
emphasis on opportunities in this realm and have is-
sued draft guidances addressing drug development for
AD [34, 46]. We provide both AD-specific and more
general examples of where regulatory changes have, or
could help, speed AD drug development.
Accelerating the review process
Accelerating the review process could shorten the over-
all development cycle by several months. At the FDA,
the update of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act
(PDUFA) V in 2013 has resulted in shorter review times
with review time goals met more often than in previous
years, and average review time reduced; in 2012, the me-
dian review time was 10 months, versus 8.5 months in
2015 [47]. The FDA has introduced expedited programs
for treatments that address unmet medical needs in
serious diseases [48]:
– Accelerated Approval is based on a surrogate
endpoint that is “reasonably likely to predict clinical
Cummings et al. Alzheimer's Research & Therapy  (2016) 8:39 
Page 6 of 12
 benefit” with clinical benefit verified through
post-approval (Phase 4) testing; it has been used
to approve over 90 new drugs and biologics, for
example, in AIDS and cancer;
– Priority Review provides a shortened FDA review
goal (6 vs 10 months, after 2 months filing) and is
based on study findings;
– Fast Track Designation involves the FDA working
closely with drug sponsors to facilitate submission of
acceptable drug development plans; once the
sponsor begins to develop its marketing application
data, it can submit the data to the FDA for “rolling
review,” rather than the usual process of submitting
the entire marketing application at once. This could
potentially save 1 to 2 months if the FDA begins
reviewing initial portions of a rolling submission
when they are available. While fast track does not
guarantee a shorter review process, fast track
submissions show more promise for receiving
priority review, pending study findings. Of the
DMTs currently in development, a few (less than 10)
have received fast track designation;
– Breakthrough Therapy Designation whereby the
FDA provides intensive guidance on an efficient
drug development program, beginning as early as
Phase 1. To date, more than 100 drug development
programs, predominantly in oncology, have been
granted breakthrough therapy designation. In cancer
drug development, breakthrough therapy designation
was associated with a 2.2-year reduction in time to
approval [49]; in that study, all drugs receiving
breakthrough designation received priority review and
most received fast track designation. Going forward,
this path could be applicable to AD drug programs.
In July 2015, the EMA revised their guidelines [50] on
the implementation of accelerated assessment and con-
ditional marketing authorization to accelerate access to
medicines that address unmet medical needs. The revi-
sions include more detailed guidance on how to justify
fulfilment of major public health interest, allows for a
faster assessment of eligible medicines by EMA scientific
committees, and emphasizes the importance of early dia-
logue with the EMA so that accelerated assessment can
be planned well ahead of the submission. The guidelines
also
specify
information
on
conditional
marketing
authorization which allows for the early approval of a
medicine on the basis of less complete clinical data than
normally required if the medicine addresses an unmet
medical need and targets a serious disease.
Study endpoint considerations
As noted above, efficient AD clinical development re-
quires that study endpoints are most appropriate for the
mechanism of action of the drug being tested (e.g., dis-
ease modifying or symptomatic treatment) and the stage
of disease being targeted (e.g., preclinical, MCI, AD de-
mentia). In the regulatory setting, it may be appropriate
to consider drug approval based on a cognitive outcome
only rather than cognition and function in these earlier
stages of disease. The difficulty in showing a drug effect
on functional endpoints in those with earlier disease is
recognized by the FDA [34] and EMA [46]. It may be
feasible to use a cognitive primary endpoint as an inter-
mediate or surrogate endpoint for an accelerated ap-
proval, followed by a continuation of the study or a
separate study demonstrating persistence of benefit to
support a later approval with standard endpoints.
Eventually, AD drug development time could be short-
ened through acceptance of more sensitive clinical end-
points and biomarkers, particularly surrogate markers
for efficacy, as data become available to support their
predictive utility for clinical benefit.
Number of pivotal studies
Approval pathways that allow two pivotal studies to use
two different populations in the AD continuum (e.g.,
one study in mild AD and one study in prodromal AD
rather than two trials for each) are being considered by
regulators [46]. This could allow availability to a broader
patient population at initial approval, thus shortening
the time to availability for one of the populations by 3 to
5 years. Taking this a step further, if conditional approval
was based on findings from a single trial in one AD
population with the requirement to test the drug more
broadly after approval, Phase 3 development could be
shortened considerably, though with a potential risk of
use of a drug that is ineffective in some populations.
Other considerations in accelerating AD drug
development
While we have focused on immediate efforts to hasten
clinical development, simultaneously there needs to be
advancement in other areas that, while not necessarily
having direct impact on the 2025 goal, will have long-
term consequences in AD drug development.
Basic research
There are currently less than 25 agents in Phase 1 AD
development [14, 51]. In light of the high attrition over
the course of drug development, this is not adequate to
ensure that new, effective, and diversified therapies suc-
cessfully complete Phase 3 development. With the time
frames required for AD drug development (Fig. 1), new
research investments in the basic science of AD will not
have their impact until after 2025. Continuing basic re-
search efforts are fundamental to eventual clinical ad-
vancement. We will need to focus efforts, including
Cummings et al. Alzheimer's Research & Therapy  (2016) 8:39 
Page 7 of 12
 funding, on furthering understanding of disease patho-
genesis to identify treatment targets, effectively deter-
mine risk, measure disease activity, and treat and
ultimately prevent disease. This is not without its chal-
lenges, particularly since the underlying neuropathology
of AD precedes symptom onset by 15 to 20 years. New
investment
in
federally
funded
basic
science
and
industry-based research will be critically important to
advancing the AD field. Also important is the diversifica-
tion of models in which efficacy can be assessed. AD
drug efficacy is typically explored using transgenic mice
but they recapitulate only a limited part of the AD biol-
ogy (e.g., amyloidosis), and efficacy has not been predict-
ive of cognitive benefit in the human setting. Improved
reproducibility of animal model observations, greater
focus on animal systems as models for only a portion of
the AD process, and increased emphasis on how best to
translate animal observations to human trials are all
areas that can increase the value of animal models in
AD drug development. Newer models include human-
derived induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, which can
increase predictive confidence of the observations in
nonclinical stages of development [52, 53].
Together with basic research in the AD field, we need
to ensure that any new knowledge is rapidly integrated
into clinical development. The scientific knowledge
available when compounds currently in Phase 3 were in
early development is now nearly a decade old. Shorten-
ing the development cycle times will lessen the gap be-
tween scientific discovery and clinical development, thus
allowing more scientifically informed drug discovery and
development.
Drug pipeline and combination therapy
In concert with basic research efforts, we need greater
diversity in the preclinical pipeline, with development
of novel therapeutic approaches and targets. More di-
versity will increase the likelihood that success in pre-
clinical development will translate to success in clinical
development (i.e., higher probability that at least one
candidate will succeed), thereby reducing the risk of
clinical development.
The pathophysiology of AD is known to be multi-
factorial, and it is anticipated that combinations of
DMTs with complementary or synergistic mechanisms
of action may have an important therapeutic role, yet
there is little opportunity for approval of a combination
therapy by 2025. Increased focus on clinical develop-
ment of combination therapies is likely a prerequisite for
an optimal therapeutic benefit, as is evidenced by
current state-of-the-art treatments for many cancers as
well as HIV-AIDS, cardiovascular disease, and tubercu-
losis. The role of and challenges with combination ther-
apies in AD have been recently highlighted by Hendrix
et al. [16]. Challenges are many and include those re-
lated to dose finding, number of required studies (exac-
erbated in the study of combination therapies where
traditionally a factorial design is required—combination
is compared to the two monotherapy arms and to
placebo) as well as strategic issues related to co-
development of combinations of drugs that reside in
different companies. Regulators are considering the im-
pact of combination therapy; for example, they acknow-
ledge that a full factorial design may be difficult for
DMTs due to the large sample sizes required in each
arm over long study periods and are open to considering
alternatives, for example exclusion of the monotherapy
arms, if scientifically justified [46]. This would reduce
the required sample sizes thus hastening trial recruit-
ment and clinical assessment.
Collaborations
Measures to speed up clinical trial execution and regula-
tory review will rely heavily on stakeholder collaborations
and data sharing. There are numerous and increasing col-
laborations among relevant parties (pharma, government,
academia, advocacy groups) and established collaborations
are joining together.
In Europe, the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI)
[54] aims to accelerate drug development by facilitating
collaboration among key players involved in healthcare
research, including universities, industry, patient organi-
zations, and medicines regulators. IMI projects include:
the Prediction of cognitive properties of new drug candi-
dates for neurodegenerative diseases in early clinical de-
velopment (PharmaCog) [55], to increase the ability to
predict new medicines from laboratory studies and clin-
ical models; the European Medical Information Frame-
work Platform (EMIF) [56], to develop a framework for
evaluating, enhancing and providing access to AD data
(including CSF data, MRI scans, PET scans, plasma sam-
ples, DNA samples and RNA samples) from across
Europe using Electronic Healthcare Record databases,
and to identify biomarkers of AD onset in the preclinical
and prodromal phase as well as for disease progression
and to identify high-risk individuals for prevention trial
participation; and the European Prevention of Alzheimer’s
Dementia (EPAD) Initiative [57], to provide an environ-
ment for testing interventions targeted at delaying the on-
set of clinical symptoms with the aim of establishing a
European-wide register of 24,000 participants.
The Critical Path Institute (C-Path) [58] is a non-
profit organization that promotes collaboration across
regulators, industry, and the research community. C-
Path’s mission is to help catalyze the translation of scien-
tific discoveries into innovative medicines, including in
AD. Within C-Path is the Coalition Against Major Dis-
eases (CAMD), which focuses on sharing precompetitive
Cummings et al. Alzheimer's Research & Therapy  (2016) 8:39 
Page 8 of 12
 patient-level data from the control arms of legacy clin-
ical trials, developing new tools, and developing consen-
sus data standards. It has also led a process that
successfully advanced a clinical trial simulation tool for
AD through the formal regulatory review process at the
FDA and EMA [59]. CAMD will integrate its AD clinical
trial data into the Global Alzheimer’s Association Inter-
active Network (GAAIN) [60] to broaden GAAIN’s data
sharing abilities. GAAIN is a platform for searching and
integrating data from AD and other dementia research
studies to assists scientists who are working to advance
research and discovery in the field.
Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer’s Disease
(AMP-AD) [61] is an initiative between the National
Institutes of Health (NIH), Pharma, and non-profit or-
ganizations. Its activities include the Biomarkers Pro-
ject to explore the utility of tau imaging and novel fluid
biomarkers for tracking responsiveness to treatment
and/or disease progression, and the Target Discovery
and Preclinical Validation Project aimed at shortening
the AD drug development process through analysis of
human tissue data and network modeling approaches.
The Alzheimer’s Prevention Initiative [62] is a collab-
oration focused on evaluating therapies in persons who
are cognitively normal but at increased genetic risk of
developing symptoms of AD. The Alzheimer’s Preven-
tion Registry [17] is part of the initiative. The Genera-
tions
study was launched through
the Alzheimer’s
Prevention Initiative and funded by NIH, Novartis, and
other funding groups, and is designed to assess the abil-
ity of two investigational anti-amyloid therapies to pre-
vent or delay the development of AD symptoms in a
population known to be at high risk for the disease be-
cause of their age and apolipoprotein E epsilon 4
(ApoE4) gene status (APOE-e4 homozygotes).
The Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Trials
Unit (DIAN-TU) [18] is a collaboration between NIH,
academic centers, industry, and the Alzheimer’s Associ-
ation to advance tirals of new therapies in high risk
populations and to help initiate meetings of key stake-
holders, including patients, regulatory agencies, industry,
and
AD
researchers
and
non-profit
organizations.
DIAN-TU also developed an expanded registry, as dis-
cussed above.
Big data
Modern biomedical data collection is generating expo-
nentially greater amounts of information, and this can
positively impact the timelines for development of new
therapies for AD. The plethora of complex data poses
significant opportunities to discover and understand
the critical interplay among such diverse domains as
genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and phenomics,
including imaging, biometrics, and clinical data [63].
Big data analytics are appropriate for interrogation of
these data and the relationships among data to produce
hypotheses
regarding
target
identification,
systems
pharmacology, and drug development. Data sharing,
causal inference and pathway-based analysis, crowd-
sourcing, and mechanism-based quantitative systems
modeling
represent
successful
real-world
modeling
opportunities where big data strategies can assist in
identifying relationships, risk factors for onset and pro-
gression, and new outcome measures that could not be
discovered with traditional analytic techniques [64].
Mechanism-based modeling, process and interaction
simulation approaches, integrated domain knowledge,
complexity science, and quantitative systems pharma-
cology can be combined with data-driven analytics to
generate predictive actionable information for drug dis-
covery programs, target validation, and optimization of
clinical development [65]. These data are available now
and are accumulating at great speed; application of
appropriate
bioinformatics
analyses
could
produce
discoveries capable of accelerating drug development
timelines and assisting in meeting the 2025 goal. Big
data will play a larger role in drug discovery and devel-
opment in the post-2025 period.
Financing
AD drug development is hugely expensive. Global finan-
cing for AD research and development is inadequate
relative to costs of the disease and the level of funding
is low compared to other diseases with a significant
public health impact. While countries are beginning to
recognize the impact of AD costs of care on global eco-
nomic growth and are making investments in this area,
it is unrealistic to rely on public financing alone. To ac-
celerate drug development efforts, more innovative ap-
proaches centered on a collaborative, cross-sector effort
that links the search for a cure with the world’s private
investment markets are needed. This will include: social
impact investing so that private investors can pursue in-
vestment returns while supporting causes that reflect
their values/priorities; venture capital and venture phil-
anthropy, for example The Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery
Foundation (ADDF) [66] and The Cure Alzheimer’s
Fund [67]; crowd funding, for example Give To Cure
[68] whose first campaign is targeting AD; state finan-
cing; industry investment in the pipeline of early stage
companies; collaboration among drug companies for risk
sharing; and academia-industry collaborations to support
research for new target identification, early drug candi-
date identification, and creation of spin-off biotechnol-
ogy companies. Investment in drug development could
also be encouraged by legislative actions to further
reduce risk and cost. For example, lengthy AD drug de-
velopment shortens the time from approval to patent
Cummings et al. Alzheimer's Research & Therapy  (2016) 8:39 
Page 9 of 12
 expiration, thus reducing the likelihood of recouping the
expense of drug development, including failed efforts;
additional patent life and tax incentives for developing
treatments for chronic neurological disorders might
make AD drug development more attractive to add-
itional industry investors.
Conclusion
Accelerating research and clinical development efforts
and bringing DMTs to market sooner would have a sig-
nificant impact on the future societal burden of AD.
Under the current conditions, only drugs currently in
late Phase 1 or later could be ready by 2025, and only if
the studies progress optimally. If pipeline attrition rates
remain high, it is likely that only a few compounds could
possibly reach this milestone. There is a great need to
reduce the time and risk of AD drug development to
reach the 2025 goal.
We have discussed the key areas by which we can ad-
dress this challenge—improvement in trial design; better
trial infrastructure; disease registries of well-characterized
patient cohorts to help with fast/timely enrollment of ap-
propriate study population; validated biomarkers to better
detect disease, determine risk and monitor disease as well
as predict disease response; more sensitive clinical assess-
ment tools; and faster regulatory review.
To implement change requires efforts to build awareness,
educate and foster engagement; financial commitment to
increase funding for both basic and clinical research; collab-
oration to reduce fragmented environments and systems,
to increase learnings from successes and failures, to pro-
mote data standardization and thus increase wider data
sharing; and a greater depth of understanding of AD at the
basic biology level and speedy translation of new knowledge
into clinical development. Improved mechanistic under-
standing of disease development and progression is critical
to more efficient AD drug development and will lead to im-
proved therapeutic approaches and targets. More effective
tools, such as biomarkers and sensitive cognitive assess-
ments, and more appropriate selection of participants will
lead to improved clinical trials. The effort required to ad-
vance a drug from bench to bedside is poorly understood
by most AD stakeholders, and education regarding the
complexities, long time frames, and expense of AD drug
development is critical. As these steps are put in place and
plans come to fruition (e.g., approval of a DMT), it can be
predicted that momentum will build, the process will be
self-sustaining, and the path to 2025, and beyond, will be-
come clearer.
