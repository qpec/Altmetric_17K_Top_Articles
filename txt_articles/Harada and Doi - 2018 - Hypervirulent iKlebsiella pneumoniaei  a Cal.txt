ABSTRACT
Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae strains have higher potential to
cause more severe and disseminated infections than classic K. pneumoniae strains.
While initially reported from East Asian countries, cases have now been identified
worldwide, sometimes in conjunction with extensive drug resistance. In this issue of
the Journal of Clinical Microbiology, T. A. Russo et al. (J Clin Microbiol 56:e00776-18,
2018, https://doi.org/10.1128/JCM.00776-18) validated the diagnostic accuracy of bio-
markers that differentiate hypervirulent K. pneumoniae strains from classic strains. This
represents a major step forward in building a consensus definition and designing
international studies aimed at elucidating the global epidemiology, clinical features,
and outcome of this important pathogen.
K
lebsiella pneumoniae infections have mainly been observed among hospitalized or
immunocompromised patients, but clinicians in Taiwan first recognized an increas-
ing number of pyogenic K. pneumoniae infections in the 1980s occurring among
community-residing individuals without apparent immunodeficiency other than diabe-
tes mellitus or anatomical abnormalities in biliary tracts (1, 2). The most common
presentation of such infections was liver abscess sometimes complicated by endoph-
thalmitis and meningitis, but other invasive infections were also reported, including
osteomyelitis and necrotizing fasciitis (3, 4). Fang and colleagues observed that most
strains causing these pyogenic infections showed hypermucoviscosity when grown on
agar plates and proposed the generation of viscous strings exceeding 5 mm between
a colony and a loop as the diagnostic criterion, which is commonly referred to as the
string test (5). These strains were much more resistant than classic K. pneumoniae to in
vitro killing by serum or to phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages and caused
liver abscess and meningitis in mice; they have thus been referred to as hypervirulent
K. pneumoniae (hvKp) strains.
The first gene identified as contributing to the hypermucoviscous phenotype in the
representative strain NTUH-K2044 was magA (mucoviscosity-associated gene A), which
also conferred increased virulence in mouse models (5). magA was later found to be
identical to the wzy gene in K1 (wzy_K1), which is part of the capsule biosynthesis
operon of strains belonging to capsule serotype K1; therefore, serotype K1 was recog-
nized as the primary serogroup causing hvKp infections in Taiwan (1, 6). These serotype
K1 strains are relatively monophyletic, belong to clonal group 23 (CG23) predominated
by sequence type 23 (ST23), and have since been reported frequently from East Asian
countries besides Taiwan, including South Korea, China, and Japan (7–9).
In addition to wzy_K1, several virulence factors have been identified that charac-
terize the hypermucoviscous and hypervirulent phenotype in serotype K1 strains. They
include the rmpA (regulator of mucoid phenotype A) genes and various siderophore

 genes. The prototypical hypermucoviscous K1 strain NTUH-K2044 carries two rmpA
plasmid-borne genes (prmpA and prmpA2) on the same large plasmid (pK2044) and
another copy on the chromosomal integrative conjugative element (ICE) (10). Epide-
miological comparison of the mucoviscous phenotype and rmpA carriage status among
K. pneumoniae bacteremia strains in Taiwan has demonstrated significant correlation
between them and additionally identified hypermucoviscous strains with rmpA in
serotypes other than K1 (11). On the other hand, rmpA- and rmpA2-positive, nonhy-
permucoviscous strains and rmpA- and rmpA2-negative, hypermucoviscous strains have
also been found, suggesting the presence of yet other factors involved in the expres-
sion of the hypermucoviscous phenotype (12). Siderophores are important virulence
factors that scavenge scarce ferric iron from the environment. In K. pneumoniae,
aerobactin (encoded by iuc genes), salmochelin (encoded by iro genes), and yersiniabactin
(encoded by irp genes) are the representative siderophores. In the serotype K1 NTUH-K2044
strain, the iuc and iro genes are located on the same plasmid pK2044 as the prmpA and
prmpA2 genes (13). Among them, the iuc genes appear to be critical in conferring accen-
tuated virulence (14, 15). More recently, some non-K1 K. pneumoniae strains, such as
K2-ST86 and K2-ST380, have also been reported to cause community-onset pyogenic
infections (16, 17). These non-K1 hypervirulent strains are more clonally diverse than
K1-ST23 strains but often carry pK2044-like plasmids encoding rmpA and iuc genes (13).
Until recently, hvKp strains had been relatively susceptible to commonly used
antimicrobial agents, with only a few exceptions, including several strains producing
extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) (7). However, a hospital-based outbreak
caused by a carbapenem-resistant, KPC-producing K. pneumoniae ST11 strain which
had acquired a pK2044-like plasmid was recently reported from China (18). The strain
was hypervirulent in vivo and in fact caused high mortality among the infected patients.
ST11 is the most common sequence type among KPC-producing K. pneumoniae strains
in China and is considered to be a classical opportunistic K. pneumoniae clonal lineage
in terms of virulence. Conversely, hypervirulent, antimicrobial-susceptible ST23 strains
have also acquired plasmids carrying blaKPC and become carbapenem resistant (19).
Thus, convergence of hypervirulence and multidrug resistance in K. pneumoniae,
through both acquisition of resistance genes by hypervirulent strains and through
acquisition of virulence genes by multidrug-resistant strains, poses a consequential
public health challenge (20).
In this issue of the Journal of Clinical Microbiology, T. A. Russo and colleagues set out
to evaluate biomarkers that can accurately differentiate hvKp and classical K. pneu-
moniae (cKp) strains (21). To do so, they first identified two sets of strains. One set
consisted of an hvKp-rich cohort of 85 clinical strains that caused pyogenic infection in
otherwise healthy outpatients in Taiwan and the United States; 45 of these strains
represented disseminated infections, including endophthalmitis and necrotizing fascii-
tis. The second set consisted of a cKp-rich cohort of 90 randomly selected bacteremia
strains collected in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, under the
assumption that hvKp strains would be extremely rare if existent at all in these
countries. As a result, 5 of the 10 virulence genes investigated (peg-344, a putative inner
membrane transporter gene located on the same virulence plasmids [22], iroB, iucA,
prmpA, and prmpA2) showed a diagnostic accuracy of �0.95 in predicting strains in the
hvKp-rich cohort. In addition, siderophore levels of �30 �g/ml as measured by a
quantitative assay had a diagnostic accuracy of 0.96. The hypervirulence of the strains
meeting these criteria was corroborated extensively in a murine sepsis model. On the
other hand, the other attributes which have been associated with hvKp, including the
typical capsule types (K1, K2, K5, K20, K54, and K57) and the string test, had a lower
diagnostic accuracy of 0.90 in predicting hvKp over cKp.
The findings of this study have multiple implications for investigations of hvKp.
Owing to the lack of a consensus definition of hvKp, studies have so far used various
criteria (e.g., specific capsule types or a positive string test, alone or in combination) to
define these strains. Because of this, whether a strain defined as hvKp in one study
would also qualify as such in another study has been unclear, which has made

 interpretation and comparison of data challenging. If we can reach a consensus
definition of hvKp by incorporating genotypic or phenotypic biomarkers validated to
achieve the high diagnostic accuracy in the present study, there will be multiple
benefits to the research and clinical communities. First of all, the microbiological and
clinical features of hvKp can be accumulated and compared across different geograph-
ical areas. Second, early identification of hvKp infections may inform clinicians, allowing
them to conduct early and vigorous searches for disseminated infection sites and
potentially consider longer antimicrobial therapy than with cKp infections. Clinical
studies can be designed to determine whether such strategies can improve patient
outcome. Third, improved definition of hvKp at the strain level will also facilitate
investigation of the potential impact of these strains on hospitalized and immunocom-
promised patients. If hvKp is found to cause severe infections in these special popu-
lations, then infection control practices may need to be evaluated to possibly imple-
ment contact precautions of carriers based on virulence rather than resistance. Finally,
departure from the string test, which is intuitive and has served us well but has now
been shown to have less than optimal accuracy, will allow for more systematic
investigations and identification of novel serotypes or clones of hvKp which may be
circulating or may emerge in the future.
The study by Russo and colleagues also identifies areas for further research. While
comprehensive detection of peg-344, iroB, iucA, prmpA, and prmpA2 is ideal, a typical
clinical microbiology laboratory is not yet equipped to routinely perform such PCR-
based tests. It is also not yet clear if detection of one of the five genes with high
diagnostic accuracy suffices. These genes often exist on the same virulence plasmids,
and thus detection of multiple genes may become redundant; but genetic changes like
deletion may alter the utility of each gene as a biomarker, depending on which specific
strains are prevalent locally. For example, the KPC-producing hvKp strain that caused
the fatal outbreak in China possessed prmpA2 but not prmpA (18), and strains from
China were not included in this study. Detection of more than one gene may be a
prudent approach for this reason. The siderophore assay proposed in this work may be
a reasonable substitute if the process can be simplified enough to be feasible in clinical
laboratories, especially in areas of endemicity. Also, whether emerging hvKp serotypes
and clones exert their virulent phenotypes through the same sets of virulence factors
remains unknown. Similar studies in different epidemiological contexts would be highly
useful to see if these results can be replicated.
In clinical practice, microbiologists and infectious disease physicians have always
inferred virulence of a microorganism based on the species identification and acted
accordingly. However, if the approach to therapy can be individualized based on the
predicted virulence of the specific infecting strain, in addition to the species and
antimicrobial susceptibility data, to optimize clinical outcome, there could be a signif-
icant impact on how we approach treatment of bacterial infections. The distinct clinical
behavior of hvKp and cKp strains implies that K. pneumoniae may be an ideal pathogen
to explore such an approach once we can come to a consensus on the definition of
hypervirulence in K. pneumoniae. The present study sets the framework for this exciting
possibility. Furthermore, having such a common definition would facilitate designing
and conducting international studies aimed at elucidating the global epidemiology and
clinical features of this emerging pathogen.
