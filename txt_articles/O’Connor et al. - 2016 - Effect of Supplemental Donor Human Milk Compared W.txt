IMPORTANCE For many very low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants, there is insufficient mother’s
milk, and a supplement of pasteurized donor human milk or preterm formula is required.
Awareness of the benefits of mother’s milk has led to an increase in use of donor milk, despite
limited data evaluating its efficacy.
OBJECTIVE To determine if nutrient-enriched donor milk compared with formula, as a
supplement to mother’s milk, reduces neonatal morbidity, supports growth, and improves
neurodevelopment in VLBW infants.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this pragmatic, double-blind, randomized trial, VLBW
infants were recruited from 4 neonatal units in Ontario, Canada, within 96 hours of birth
between October 2010 and December 2012. Follow-up was completed in July 2015.
INTERVENTIONS Infants were fed either donor milk or formula for 90 days or to discharge
when mother’s milk was unavailable.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the cognitive composite score on
the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (Bayley-III) at 18 months’
corrected age (standardized mean, 100 [SD, 15]; minimal clinically important difference,
5 points). Secondary outcomes included Bayley-III language and motor composite scores,
growth, and a dichotomous mortality and morbidity index.
RESULTS Of 840 eligible infants, 363 (43.2%) were randomized (181 to donor milk and 182 to
preterm formula); of survivors, 299 (92%) had neurodevelopment assessed. Mean birth
weight and gestational age of infants was 996 (SD, 272) g and 27.7 (2.6) weeks, respectively,
and 195 (53.7%) were male. No statistically significant differences in mean Bayley-III cognitive
composite score (adjusted scores, 92.9 in donor milk group vs 94.5 in formula group; fully
adjusted mean difference, −2.0 [95% CI, −5.8 to 1.8]), language composite score (adjusted
scores, 87.3 in donor milk group vs 90.3 in formula group; fully adjusted mean difference,
−3.1 [95% CI, −7.5 to 1.3]), or motor composite score (adjusted scores, 91.8 in donor milk
group vs 94.0 in formula group; fully adjusted mean difference, −3.7 [95% CI, −7.4 to 0.09])
were observed between groups. There was no statistically significant difference in infants
positive for the mortality and morbidity index (43% in donor milk group, 40% in formula
group) or changes in growth z scores.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among VLBW infants, use of supplemental donor milk
compared with formula did not improve neurodevelopment at 18 months’ corrected age. If
donor milk is used in settings with high provision of mother’s milk, this outcome should not
be considered a treatment goal.

F
eeding mother’
s milk is associated with reduced risk of
necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis, and hospital readmis-
sion and improved neurodevelopment among very
low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants (<1500 g).1-6 Bioactive mol-
ecules found in mother’
s milk that promote gastrointestinal
development and reduce the risk of infection are thought to
play an important role in these associations.7,8 However, most
VLBW infants require a supplement to mother’
s milk. With an
increasing awareness of the benefits of mother’
s milk, use of
pasteurized donor human milk (donor milk) as a supplement
has increased substantially in North America.9,10 The Human
Milk Banking Association of North America estimated that its
members dispensed 3.8 million ounces of donor milk in 2015.9
Despite this shift in practice, there are limited data evalu-
ating the efficacy of “nutrient-fortified” donor milk com-
pared with preterm formula. In a systematic review, Quigley
and McGuire11 reported that using formula as a supplement to
mother’
s milk increased the risk ratio of necrotizing entero-
colitis compared with donor milk (2.8 [95% CI, 1.4 to 5.5]), but
weight,length,andheadcircumferencegainsweregreater.Be-
cause donor milk in most included studies was not fortified
with nutrients, the growth findings are not surprising but are
important given the relationship between early nutrition,
growth, and neurodevelopment in VLBW infants.12-14 Whether
nutrient fortification of donor milk improves growth in rela-
tiontopretermformulaoraffectsthenecrotizingenterocolitis–
protective properties of donor milk is unclear.
The purpose of this study was to determine whether nu-
trient-enriched donor milk compared with preterm formula,
as a supplement to mother’
s milk during initial hospitaliza-
tion, improves the cognitive (primary outcome), language, and
motor development of VLBW infants at 18 months’corrected
age. Other secondary outcomes included growth and a mor-
tality and morbidity index.
Methods
Study Design
In this pragmatic, double-blind, randomized clinical trial,
VLBW infants were enrolled between October 2010 and De-
cember 2012 from 4 tertiary care neonatal intensive care units
(NICUs) in Southern Ontario, Canada. Detailed descriptions of
study procedures have been published and are provided in
Supplement 1.15 Human research ethics boards at each partici-
pating hospital approved the study protocol. An independent
dataandsafetymonitoringcommitteereviewedkeysafetydata
(growth, major morbidity, death) after the first one-third and
two-thirds of infants completed the feeding intervention.
Infants were eligible for participation if their birth weight
was less than 1500 g, if they were to commence enteral feed-
ing within 7 days of birth, and if written informed consent was
secured from a guardian within 96 hours of birth. Infants were
ineligible if, prior to enrollment, they were diagnosed with a
serious congenital or chromosomal anomaly that could con-
tribute to poor neurodevelopment, experienced severe birth
asphyxia, were enrolled in another study affecting nutri-
tional management, or had a reasonable potential of transfer
to a NICU not participating in the study. Study day 1 was de-
fined as the day consent was obtained and the feeding inter-
vention commenced.
Feedinggroupallocationwasperformedusingacomputer-
driventhird-partyrandomizationserviceinwhichinfantswere
assignedto1ofthe2treatmentsinaratioof1:1inrandomblocks
of 4 or 8, with stratification by recruitment center and birth
weight group (<1000 g, 1000-1499 g). All members of the re-
search and clinical teams (including assessors of neurodevel-
opment) and families were blinded to group allocation, with
theexceptionofastudydietitiananddiettechnicianswhopre-
pared study feeds. Using feeding orders received daily from
each NICU specifying the volume and nutrient density of en-
teral feeding required, study feeds were prepared under lami-
nar flow, packaged into amber oral dispensers, and delivered
daily to NICUs from 1 of 2 centralized milk preparation rooms.
Infants continued to receive study feeds by courier on trans-
fer to any 1 of 17 participating level II NICUs, and study re-
search staff visited these hospitals weekly to monitor adher-
ence to the study protocol and collect data. In Ontario, when
acute care is no longer required, infants are transferred from
a level III to level II NICU for convalescence.
To confirm that the sample reflected the diversity of in-
fants and their families in NICUs in Canada, baseline informa-
tion including each infant’
s birth anthropometrics and mater-
nal age, education, and ethnicity were collected from the
medical record or parental report at enrollment. Mothers self-
selectedtheirethnicityfromafixedlistbutwereinvitedtopro-
vide a more appropriate descriptor as desired. Families were
called monthly after discharge, visited during follow-up clini-
cal appointments, and scheduled for neurodevelopmental as-
sessment of children at 18 months’corrected age. Follow-up
of children was completed in July 2015.

Key Points
Question Does use of nutrient-enriched donor milk compared
with preterm formula, as a supplement to mother’s milk during
hospitalization, improve cognitive development of very
low-birth-weight infants at 18 months’ corrected age?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 363 infants, no
statistically significant differences in cognitive composite scores
on the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development,
Third Edition were found between feeding groups after
adjustment for recruitment center, birth weight group, percentage
of total enteral feeds for each infant consumed as mother’s milk,
and maternal education.
Meaning If donor milk is used in a setting with high provision of
mother’s milk, improved neurocognitive development should not
be considered a treatment goal.

(>95%) with backup from the NorthernStar Mothers’Milk
Bank.9 Each batch of donor milk from Ohio was prepared using
pooled milk from at least 3 women who had delivered within
the previous 3 months. In the formula group, Similac Special
Care (Abbott Laboratories) or Enfamil Premature (Mead John-
son Nutritionals) was provided, depending on hospital con-
tractual obligations. Formulas were designed for preterm in-
fants and were available in 20 or 24 kcal/oz, with 3.0 g of
protein/100 kcal.
Enteral feeds were initiated and advanced according to
published guidelines agreed on prior to study commence-
ment by participating NICUs (level II and III) and reflected lo-
cal clinical practice at the time (Supplement 1).15 Enteral feeds
were initiated as soon as possible after birth and advanced at
a rate of 10 to 25 mL/kg/d up to 160 mL/kg/d. Nutrient fortifi-
cation of human milk commenced at 120 mL/kg/d or more
using powdered bovine-based multinutrient fortifiers (Similac
Human Milk Fortifier [Abbott Laboratories] or Enfamil Human
Milk Fortifier [Mead Johnson Nutritionals]). Once fortifica-
tionofdonormilkcommenced,aproteinmodule(Beneprotein
[Nestle]) was added to increase the estimated protein concen-
tration of donor milk (0.9 g/dL) to that of mature mother’
s milk
(1.2 g/dL).16,17 If an infant did not achieve a weight gain of at
least 15 g/kg/d, clinical teams prescribed more concentrated
feeds. Neither donor milk nor probiotics were used routinely
in participating NICUs at the time of the study.
Study Outcomes
The primary outcome was the cognitive composite score on
the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third
Edition (Bayley-III) at 18 months’corrected age.18 Secondary
outcomes included Bayley-III language and motor composite
scores, a mortality and morbidity index, and growth during the
feedingintervention.Intheoriginalstudyproposal,visualacu-
ity and contrast sensitivity at 4 and 6 months’corrected age
were planned secondary outcomes. Because of a budget cut
at the time the grant was awarded, these outcomes were not
measured.
The Bayley-III is designed to assess the cognitive, lan-
guage (receptive, expressive), and motor (fine, gross) devel-
opment of infants from 1 to 42 months of age.18 Cognitive, lan-
guage, and motor composite scores were standardized to a
mean of 100, with a standard deviation of 15. Using an ap-
proach used by other experts in the field,19,20 children who at-
tendedtheneurocognitiveassessmentfollow-upvisitbutcould
not complete the Bayley-III because of severe disability or who
performed below the threshold of the test for individual com-
positescores(cognitive,language,motor)wereassignedascore
of 49. Neurodevelopment testing took place at recruiting cen-
ters by experienced testers who underwent additional train-
ing and recertification (>80% agreement on videotaped ses-
sions) prior to testing study infants.
In post hoc exploratory analyses, the proportion of in-
fantswithcompositescoreslessthan70,aligningwiththeBay-
ley-III manual classification of “extremely low,” were de-
scribed as showing evidence of disability and compared
between groups. Participants with scores less than 85, de-
fined by the Bayley-III as “low average, borderline and ex-
tremely low,” were described as showing evidence of neuro-
impairment and were also compared between groups.
Post hoc sensitivity analyses were performed on neurode-
velopmental outcomes to try to ensure that inclusion of chil-
dren unlikely to perform well on the Bayley-III did not affect
study findings. In the first set of analyses, participants who ex-
periencedseriousbraininjuryduringhospitalizationandthose
with cerebral palsy and hearing impairment (eg, requiring am-
plification) were excluded. No child had visual impairment as
defined by visual acuity less than 20/200 in at least 1 eye. In a
second set of sensitivity analyses, all participants were in-
cluded, but data were analyzed using nonparametric statisti-
cal procedures.
Themortalityandmorbidityindexwasadichotomousvari-
ableforwhichapositiveresponseindicatedthatachildhaddied
or had any one of a predetermined list of major morbidities
shown previously to be inversely related to provision of hu-
man milk.3,4,11 This list of morbidities included late-onset sep-
sis (positive blood or cerebrospinal fluid culture), necrotizing
enterocolitis(Bellstage≥II),21chroniclungdisease(oxygensup-
port at 36 weeks), or retinopathy of prematurity (Interna-
tionalstage4/5,laserorintraocularantivascularinjection).22-24
Anexploratoryanalysisofindividualmorbidities,includingnec-
rotizing enterocolitis, was preplanned, although the study was
not powered to detect differences in all individual morbidi-
ties. An amendment to the protocol to collect data on severe
brain injury, defined as echodense intraparenchymal lesions,
periventricularleukomalacia,porencephaliccysts,orventricu-
lomegalywithorwithoutintraventricularhemorrhage,wasap-
proved after study initiation but before unblinding the study.25
Blinded adjudication of necrotizing enterocolitis and brain in-
jury was conducted by at least 2 neonatologists and 1 radiolo-
gist using clinical data, radiographs, ultrasounds, and pathol-
ogy results. Infants classified as having “NEC [necrotizing
enterocolitis] of any stage” needed to demonstrate clinical
symptoms according to Bell criteria, followed by treatment
(eg, suspension of enteral feeds and administration of antibi-
otics for 7 days).21 Those infants with radiographic, ultra-
sound, or surgical evidence of pneumatosis, gas in the portal
tract, or perforation or histological evidence of bowel ische-
mia consistent with necrotizing enterocolitis were classified as
Bell stage II or greater.
Growth was assessed as a change in absolute measures and
z scores for weight, length, and head circumference between
study day 1 and the end of the feeding intervention.26 Daily
enteral feed volumes were prospectively extracted from the
infant’
s medical record and merged at study completion with
the enteral feeding type database maintained by the un-
blinded diet technicians.
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were carried out using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute
Inc) using an intent-to-treat approach. All statistical tests of hy-
pothesis were 2-tailed, and P < .05 was considered statisti-
cally significant. All available data for infants who died or who
were withdrawn from the study were used in statistical analy-
ses, except for analyses of growth between study day 1 and the
end of the feeding intervention, where infants who died were

including neurodevelopment scores for infants who died.
A sample size of 176 infants in each treatment group was
estimated to be sufficient to detect a 5-point difference in the
Bayley-III cognitive composite score with 80% power (α = .05)
and a standard deviation of 15.15 This assumed a 30% rate of
exclusive mother’
s milk feeding, 10% loss to follow-up dur-
ing hospitalization, and 10% loss to follow-up after dis-
charge. An effect size of 5 points was chosen because the lit-
erature suggests that this difference could translate into a
reduction in the number of children born preterm requiring
special education services (with associated costs) and an im-
provement in longer-term academic achievement.6 A meta-
analysis completed prior to study initiation reported a differ-
ence of 5.18 in cognitive scores between infants born weighing
less than 2500 g who were fed mother’
s milk vs formula, sug-
gesting that this effect size was achievable.1
Continuous neurodevelopmental outcome variables were
analyzed between feeding groups using analysis of covari-
ance. Categorical variables (neurodevelopmental outcomes,
morbidities) were analyzed between feeding groups using lo-
gisticregression.Toimprovetheprecisionofestimatesandtest
for potential interactions, variables of interest were included in
the models. For model 1, the analyses were adjusted for ran-
domization strata (recruitment center and birth weight group).

Results
Study Infants
Of 840 eligible infants, 363 (43.2%) were assigned to receive
either donor milk (n = 181) or formula (n = 182) if mother’
s milk
was unavailable (Figure). Thirty-seven infants died (17 in the
donor milk group, 20 in the formula group), all during initial
hospitalization. Baseline characteristics of infants and their
familieswerecomparablebetweengroups(Table1).Meanbirth
weight and gestational age of infants in the study population
were 996 (SD, 272) g and 27.7 (SD, 2.6) weeks, respectively; 275
(76%) of infants were born weighing less than 1250 g; 195
(53.7%) were male. Multiple births accounted for 36% of in-
fants, and 12% were born small for gestational age.26 The
sample represented diversity of ethnicity, educational attain-
ment, and income.
Feeding Intervention
The median day infants commenced enteral feeds was day 3
(interquartile range [IQR], 2-4) in both feeding groups. In-
fants randomized to the donor milk and formula groups re-
mained in the intervention for a median of 65 (IQR, 41-90) and
60 (IQR, 43-90) days, respectively (P = .40). Thirty-four in-
fants were withdrawn from the feeding intervention but con-
tinued in the study, of which 20 were randomized to the do-
nor milk group and 14 to the preterm formula group. This
subgroup of infants remained in the feeding intervention for
a median of 50 (IQR, 25-62) days. Reasons for withdrawal from
the intervention included transfer to a nonparticipating hos-
pital (n = 16), clinical team wished to thicken feeds (n = 7), par-
ent withdrew consent (n = 9), and study feeds not tolerated
(n = 2). A similar percentage of infants in the donor milk group
(28.2%) and formula group (26.9%) were exclusively fed moth-
er’
s milk. Among infants requiring a supplement, there was no
statistically significant difference between the donor milk and
formula groups in the proportion of total enteral feeds for each
infant consumed as mother’
s milk (58.4% [IQR, 13.6%-
96.0%] vs 63.3% [IQR, 9.6%-97.2%], respectively, P = .96).
Neurodevelopment
Of survivors, 151 of 164 (92.1%) in the donor milk group and
148 of 162 (91.4%) in the formula group had neurodevelop-
mental assessments completed. Mean corrected age of in-
fants at neurodevelopmental testing was 18.6 (SD, 2.0) months
in the donor milk group and 18.8 (SD, 2.5) months in the for-
mula group. No statistically significant difference in mean cog-
nitive composite scores (primary outcome) was found be-
tween feeding groups in either model 1, adjusting for
randomization strata (adjusted scores, 92.9 in the donor milk
groupvs94.5intheformulagroup;meandifference,−1.6[95%
CI, −5.5 to 2.2]), or model 2, further adjusting for percentage
oftotalenteralfeedsforeachinfantconsumedasmother’
smilk
and maternal education (mean difference, −2.0 [95% CI, −5.8
to 1.8]) (Table 2). Likewise, no statistically significant differ-
ences in mean language composite score (adjusted scores, 87.3
in the donor milk group vs 90.3 in the formula group; mean
difference, −3.0 [95% CI, −7.5 to 1.5] in model 1; −3.1 [95% CI,
−7.5 to 1.3] in model 2) and motor composite score (adjusted
scores, 91.8 in the donor milk group vs 94.0 in the formula
group; mean difference, −2.2 [95% CI, −6.0 to 1.7] in model 1
and −3.7 [95% CI, −7.4 to 0.09] in model 2) were found be-
tween feeding groups. These findings remained unchanged in
a sensitivity analysis that excluded infants with severe brain

term formula group), or hearing impairment (5 in each group)
(eTable in Supplement 2) or in nonparametric analyses includ-
ing all participants (eFigure 1 in Supplement 2) or only those
who received a supplement of donor milk or formula during
the intervention (eFigure 2 in Supplement 2).
In post hoc exploratory analyses, more children in the do-
nor milk group (27.2%) were found to have cognitive compos-
ite scores indicative of neuroimpairment (<85) compared with
the formula group (16.2%) (Table 2). The adjusted risk differ-
ence was 10.6% (95% CI, 1.5% to 19.6%; P = .02). No statisti-
cally significant differences were observed in the proportion
of children with neurodevelopment composite scores indica-
tive of disability (<70).
In-Hospital Growth and Morbidity
Anthropometric measures were comparable between feeding
groups at study day 1 and at the end of the feeding interven-
tion, whether expressed as absolute measures or z scores
(Table 3). In both groups, there was a decline in the mean
weight-for-age z scores (−0.5 [95% CI, −0.7 to −0.3]) and
length-for-age z scores (−1.0 [95% CI, −1.2 to −0.8]) during
the intervention.
Forty-threepercentand40%ofchildrenrandomizedtothe
donor milk and formula groups, respectively, scored positive
on the mortality and morbidity index (Table 4). The adjusted
risk difference was 5.0% (95% CI, −2.7% to 12.7%; P = .20). In
a preplanned exploratory analysis of individual morbidities,
fewer infants in the donor milk group had necrotizing entero-
colitisstageIIorgreater(1.7%)thanintheformulagroup(6.6%)
(risk difference, −4.9% [95% CI, −9.0% to −0.9%]; P = .02). No
other differences in individual morbidities were observed be-
tween feeding groups.
Discussion
Results from the present study suggest no advantage of feed-
ing nutrient-enriched donor milk compared with preterm for-
mula, as a supplement to mother’
s milk, on neurodevelop-
ment of VLBW infants at 18 months’corrected age as assessed
by the Bayley-III. No statistically significant differences be-
tween feeding groups in cognitive, language, or motor com-
positescoreswereobserved,regardlessofwhetherinfantswith
seriousbraininjury,cerebralpalsy,orhearingimpairmentwere
included or excluded from the analyses or whether statistical
models controlled for percentage of total enteral feeds for each
infant consumed as mother’
s milk during the intervention and
formaternaleducation.Theseresultsareconsistentwiththose
reported by Lucas and colleagues29 from the early 1980s, for
which the dose of the supplement was probably greater, al-
though human milk was not nutrient-enriched. In the present
study, the adjusted mean difference in cognitive scores be-
tween treatments was less than the defined minimal clini-
cally important difference of 5 points.6 This suggests that it is
unlikely that a larger sample size with greater statistical power
would yield a different study conclusion.
There are several possible reasons why the hypothesized
improvement in neurodevelopment using donor milk as a
supplement was not observed. First, while it was not pos-

donormilkdifferintheirnutrientandbioactivecomposition.30
Heat treatment, additional freezing and thawing, and con-
tainerchangesinvolvedinprocessingandstorageofdonormilk
affect its energy, protein, and heat-sensitive water-soluble vi-
tamin content.30 Pasteurization affects many bioactive com-
ponents in human milk (eg, live cells, lactoferrin) that play a
role in reducing serious morbidity (eg, sepsis), which in turn
affects neurodevelopment.30-32
Post hoc exploratory analysis showed that more children
in the donor milk group compared with the preterm formula
group had cognitive composite scores indicative of neuroim-
pairment. Given the number of comparisons made, this latter
finding could be attributable to chance. However, these ob-
servations are consistent with the hypothesis that subopti-
mal nutrient delivery has the greatest effect among the most
vulnerable infants, who often have the highest nutrient
requirements.33
In the systematic review by Quigley and McGuire,11 in-
fantsrandomizedtoreceivedonormilkhadslowergrowththan
infants randomized to receive formula; however, only 2 of 9
trials included in their analyses used donor milk fortified with
nutrients. Although no statistically significant differences in
growth between groups were observed in the present study,
results showed a 0.5- to 1.0-SD decline in weight for age and
length for age during the intervention, suggesting that growth
and likely nutritional intake were suboptimal in both groups
of infants.
In a preplanned exploratory analysis, feeding nutrient-
enriched donor milk to VLBW infants as a supplement during
initial hospitalization was associated with a lower risk of nec-
rotizing enterocolitis stage II or greater (1.7%) compared with
feeding preterm formula (6.6%). The incidence of necrotiz-
ing enterocolitis stage II or greater among VLBW infants in the
donor milk group was lower than in national Canadian data for
2011 (6.0%) and 2012 (5.2%), despite a higher proportion of in-
fants born weighing less than 1250 g.34,35 Reduction in necro-
tizingenterocolitisinthedonormilkgroupwasconsistentwith
that reported in the Cochrane review by Quigley and McGuire11
but not with the recent Early Nutrition Study,36 in which use
of donor milk as a supplement demonstrated no protection
againstnecrotizingenterocolitis.Longerdurationofdonormilk
use in the present trial (median, 65 [IQR, 41-90] days) com-
pared with the Early Nutrition Study (up to 10 days) seems a
possible explanation.
Randomization and blinding of study feedings are
strengths of the present study, because they minimize biases
associated with open-label and observational feeding stud-
ies. Although the Bayley-III is validated for assessment of early
developmental delays, it is a global assessment tool, and its use
may have limited the ability to capture subtle differences in
function. Further, the predictive validity of the Bayley-III at
18 months’corrected age is unclear.37,38 To address these limi-
tations, additional neurocognitive assessments of study par-
ticipants will occur at age 5 years.
Conclusions
Among VLBW infants, the use of supplemental donor milk
compared with preterm formula did not result in an improve-
ment in a measure of neurodevelopment at 18 months’cor-
rected age. If donor milk is used in a setting with high provi-
sion of mother’
s milk, this outcome should not be considered
a treatment goal.
