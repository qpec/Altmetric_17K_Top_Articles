BACKGROUND
Among patients with chronic heart failure, angiotensin-converting–enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitors reduce mortality and hospitalization, but the role of a renin inhibitor in 
such patients is unknown. We compared the ACE inhibitor enalapril with the renin 
inhibitor aliskiren (to test superiority or at least noninferiority) and with the com-
bination of the two treatments (to test superiority) in patients with heart failure 
and a reduced ejection fraction.
METHODS
After a single-blind run-in period, we assigned patients, in a double-blind fashion, 
to one of three groups: 2336 patients were assigned to receive enalapril at a dose 
of 5 or 10 mg twice daily, 2340 to receive aliskiren at a dose of 300 mg once 
daily, and 2340 to receive both treatments (combination therapy). The primary 
composite outcome was death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for 
heart failure.
RESULTS
After a median follow-up of 36.6 months, the primary outcome occurred in 770 
patients (32.9%) in the combination-therapy group and in 808 (34.6%) in the 
enalapril group (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85 to 1.03). The 
primary outcome occurred in 791 patients (33.8%) in the aliskiren group (hazard 
ratio vs. enalapril, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.90 to 1.10); the prespecified test for noninferior-
ity was not met. There was a higher risk of hypotensive symptoms in the combi-
nation-therapy group than in the enalapril group (13.8% vs. 11.0%, P 
= 
0.005), as 
well as higher risks of an elevated serum creatinine level (4.1% vs. 2.7%, P 
= 
0.009) 
and an elevated potassium level (17.1% vs. 12.5%, P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS
In patients with chronic heart failure, the addition of aliskiren to enalapril led to 
more adverse events without an increase in benefit. Noninferiority was not shown 
for aliskiren as compared with enalapril. (Funded by Novartis; ATMOSPHERE 
ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00853658.)

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
A 
ngiotensin-converting–enzyme 
(ACE) inhibitors are effective in lowering 
the risks of death and hospitalization 
among patients with chronic heart failure and 
reduced ejection fraction.1,2 As a consequence, 
there has been interest in other approaches to 
interruption of the renin–angiotensin system in 
patients with heart failure. Angiotensin-receptor 
blockers (ARBs) were the first alternative tested, 
and in one placebo-controlled trial, candesartan 
was associated with lower risks of death from 
cardiovascular causes and hospitalization for 
heart failure among patients who could not 
take ACE inhibitors.3 However, in a head-to-head 
comparison, losartan was not as effective as 
captopril.4
The combination of an ARB and an ACE in-
hibitor has also been examined in two trials 
involving patients with heart failure.5,6 In both 
trials, the addition of an ARB to standard ther-
apy with an ACE inhibitor was associated with a 
lower risk of hospitalization for heart failure 
than was standard therapy alone and, in one 
trial, with a lower risk of death from cardiovas-
cular causes. Neither trial, however, mandated 
an evidence-based dose of ACE inhibitor, and 
subsequent trials that did so showed that the 
addition of an ARB was ineffective in patients 
with myocardial infarction and in other patients 
at high cardiovascular risk.7,8
Renin inhibition offers another approach to 
interruption of the renin–angiotensin system.9-11 
We tested whether combining the renin inhibi-
tor aliskiren with the ACE inhibitor enalapril 
was superior to enalapril alone and whether 
aliskiren was at least noninferior to enalapril in 
patients with heart failure.12,13
Methods
Trial Oversight
The Aliskiren Trial to Minimize Outcomes in 
Patients with Heart Failure (ATMOSPHERE) was 
a randomized trial comparing enalapril alone 
with aliskiren alone and with the combination 
of aliskiren and enalapril in patients with heart 
failure. The design of the trial and the character-
istics of the patients at baseline have been pub-
lished previously.12,13 The executive committee 
(see the Supplementary Appendix, available with 
the full text of this article at NEJM.org) designed 
and oversaw the conduct of the trial in collabo-
ration with the sponsor (Novartis). The trial pro-
tocol, which is available at NEJM.org, was ap-
proved by the ethics committee at each center. 
Data were collected and analyzed by the sponsor 
according to a prespecified statistical analysis 
plan; the analyses were replicated by an indepen-
dent statistician, who is one of the authors. The 
initial draft of the manuscript was prepared by 
the first author and edited by all the authors, 
who had unrestricted access to the data and 
agreed to submit the manuscript for publication. 
The authors assume responsibility for the accu-
racy and completeness of the data and analyses 
as well as for the fidelity of this report to the 
trial protocol.
Patients
Eligible patients had chronic heart failure with 
New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II to IV 
symptoms and an ejection fraction of 35% or less. 
Participants were also required to have a plasma 
B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentration 
of 150 pg or more per milliliter (or an N-terminal 
pro-BNP [NT-proBNP] concentration of ≥600 pg 
per milliliter) or, if they had been hospitalized 
for heart failure within the previous 12 months, 
a BNP concentration of 100 pg or more per milli-
liter (or an NT-proBNP concentration of ≥400 pg 
per milliliter). Participants must have been re-
ceiving stable doses of an ACE inhibitor (equiva-
lent to at least 10 mg of enalapril daily) and of a 
beta-blocker at the time of enrollment.
Exclusion criteria included symptomatic hypo-
tension, a systolic blood pressure of less than 
95 mm Hg at screening (or <90 mm Hg at ran-
domization), an estimated glomerular filtration 
rate (GFR) of less than 40 ml per minute per 
1.73 m2 of body-surface area at screening (or 
<35 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 at randomization 
or a decline of >25% in the estimated GFR between 
screening and randomization), a serum potas-
sium concentration of 5.0 mmol or more per liter 
at screening (or ≥5.2 mmol per liter at randomiza-
tion), and a history of inability to take ACE inhibi-
tors. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are 
provided in the Supplementary Appendix. All the 
participants provided written informed consent.
Procedures
The trial included a two-part run-in phase. After 
switching from their existing ACE inhibitor, 
eligible patients entered the first part of the run-

in phase, during which they received 1 to 4 weeks 
of enalapril at a dose of 5 mg twice daily, in a 
single-blind fashion, followed (if the level of ad-
verse events was not unacceptable) by 2 to 4 weeks 
of enalapril at a dose of 10 mg twice daily; pa-
tients who had been taking a dose of ACE in-
hibitor that was equivalent to 20 mg of enalapril 
daily before the trial could start at the second 
step directly. At the end of this period, patients 
were stratified according to the dose of enalapril 
that could be taken without unacceptable ad-
verse events: 5 mg twice daily (low-dose stratum) 
or 10 mg twice daily (high-dose stratum). Pa-
tients then entered the second part of the run-in 
phase, during which they received aliskiren at a 
dose of 150 mg once daily, in a single-blind 
fashion, in addition to enalapril.
Patients who could take both treatments were 
randomly assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, to double-
blind, double-dummy treatment in one of three 
groups with the use of a voice-based computer-
ized randomization system involving concealed 
trial-group assignments. Patients were assigned 
to the combination of enalapril at a dose of 5 or 
10 mg twice daily and aliskiren at a dose of 150 mg 
once daily, aliskiren at a dose of 150 mg once 
daily, or enalapril at a dose of 5 or 10 mg twice 
daily. Two weeks after randomization, the dose 
of aliskiren was increased to 300 mg once daily 
in the combination-therapy group and the aliski-
ren group, with sham adjustment in the enalapril 
group. Patients were evaluated every 2 to 8 weeks 
during the first 4 months and every 4 months 
thereafter. The dose could be decreased in pa-
tients who could not take the target doses.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was a composite of death 
from cardiovascular causes or a first hospitaliza-
tion for heart failure. The secondary outcomes 
were the change from baseline to 12 months in 
the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire 
(KCCQ) clinical summary score and the change 
in the NT-proBNP concentration from baseline 
to 4 months (this outcome was removed after the 
protocol was amended, as explained below).12-14 
Additional prespecified exploratory outcomes are 
listed in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix. A clinical-event committee adjudicated deaths 
and major cardiovascular outcomes in a blinded 
fashion, using prespecified criteria (see the Sup-
plementary Appendix).
Statistical Analysis
The original coprimary objectives were, first, to 
test whether the combination of aliskiren and 
enalapril was superior to enalapril for the pri-
mary outcome and, second, to test whether 
aliskiren alone was superior, or at least non-
inferior, to enalapril with respect to the same 
outcome. On the basis of our initial power calcu-
lation (see the Supplementary Appendix), we es-
timated that 7041 patients would need to undergo 
randomization and that 2318 primary-outcome 
events would need to occur.
While the trial was ongoing, premature ter-
mination of the Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Dia-
betes Using Cardio-Renal Disease Endpoints 
(ALTITUDE) because of futility and safety con-
cerns, and the subsequent finding in the Aliski-
ren Trial on Acute Heart Failure Outcomes 
(ASTRONAUT) of worse outcomes in patients 
with diabetes treated with aliskiren than in those 
who received placebo, led the Clinical Trial Facili-
tation Group of the Heads of Medicines Agencies 
in Europe to mandate that persons with diabetes 
at baseline and those in whom diabetes devel-
oped during the present trial discontinue the 
treatment and be switched to conventional 
therapy and that no further patients with dia-
betes be enrolled. This decision was executed 
worldwide in a protocol amendment issued in 
April 2013.13,15,16
This decision led to amendment of the sta-
tistical analysis plan. In patients with diabetes, 
follow-up for trial outcomes was censored on the 
date of the enactment of the protocol amend-
ment (or on the date of other country-specific 
requests mandating the stopping of the trial 
treatment). Comparison of the combination ther-
apy with enalapril in patients without diabetes 
became an additional superiority hypothesis. 
The change in the NT-proBNP concentration was 
removed as a secondary outcome.13 The power 
for the primary analyses was preserved, as de-
scribed in the Supplementary Appendix.
Analyses included all the patients who under-
went randomization validly, according to the 
intention-to-treat principle. Time-to-event data 
were evaluated with the use of Cox proportional-
hazards models, as described in the statistical 
analysis plan (see the protocol). Consistency of 
treatment effects was assessed among 25 pre-
specified subgroups by inclusion of an interac-
tion term for each subgroup. The change in the

KCCQ score was evaluated with a repeated-
measures analysis. Adverse events were compared 
with the use of Fisher’s exact test; prospectively 
defined adverse events of interest included hy-
potension, renal impairment, hyperkalemia, and 
cough.
All P values are two-sided (except for non-
inferiority). A gatekeeping procedure that com-
bined hierarchical and simultaneous testing based 
on Bonferroni adjustment was used to ensure 
control of the type I error rate for the primary 
and secondary outcomes (see the Supplementary 
Appendix). On the basis of this procedure, the 
prespecified one-sided alpha level for the decla-
ration of noninferiority (for aliskiren vs. enala-
pril) was 0.0123.
Results
Patients
From March 13, 2009, to December 26, 2013, a 
total of 8835 patients at 789 centers in 43 coun-
tries entered the run-in period (Fig. 1). Of these, 
1771 patients did not fulfill the criteria for ran-
domization, and 48 underwent randomization 
erroneously or were enrolled at sites that were 
subsequently closed owing to serious violations of 
Good Clinical Practice guidelines; these patients 
were prospectively omitted from all analyses. Ac-
cordingly, for the intention-to-treat analysis, 2340 
patients were randomly assigned to the combi-
nation therapy of enalapril plus aliskiren, 2340 to 
aliskiren alone, and 2336 to enalapril alone. The 
percentage of patients in the high-dose stratum 
for enalapril was 89% in each treatment group. 
Overall, the treatment groups were balanced with 
respect to the characteristics at baseline (Table 1). 
Participants with diabetes at baseline were 
older and more likely to have ischemic heart 
disease than were those without diabetes. (For 
further information, see Tables S2 and S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix.)
Follow-up
Overall, the median follow-up was 36.6 months 
(interquartile range 22.4 to 52.2), with no sig-
nificant difference among the three groups. The 
number of patients who were lost to follow-up 
for vital status before the completion of the trial 
(or owing to regulatory censoring with regard 
to patients with diabetes) was 31 (1.3%) in the 
combination-therapy group, 19 (0.8%) in the 
aliskiren group, and 19 (0.8%) in the enalapril 
group. For patients who did not have data cen-
sored for a regulatory reason, follow-up ended 
on July 31, 2015.
The number of patients who had data cen-
sored because of diabetes was 665 (28.4%) in the 
combination-therapy group, 627 (26.8%) in the 
aliskiren group, and 652 (27.9%) in the enalapril 
group. An additional 20, 25, and 18 patients in 
each group, respectively, had data censored be-
cause of other country-specific requests (Fig. 1). 
In persons without diabetes, the median follow-
up was 46.0 months (interquartile range, 28.0 to 
56.1); the median follow-up in patients with dia-
betes was 24.1 months (interquartile range, 15.1 
to 33.2).
Treatment Administration
In persons without diabetes, the trial treatment 
was discontinued in 741 of 1675 patients (44.2%) 
in the combination-therapy group, in 693 of 1713 
(40.5%) in the aliskiren group, and in 706 of 
1684 (41.9%) in the enalapril group for reasons 
other than death or an administrative reason. 
The mean percentage of possible treatment time 
that patients took the trial medication was 77% 
in the combination-therapy group, 81% in the 
aliskiren group, and 80% in the enalapril group.
Among patients with diabetes, 211 of 665 pa-
tients (31.7%) in the combination-therapy group, 
175 of 627 (27.9%) in the aliskiren group, and 
209 of 652 (32.1%) in the enalapril group discon-
tinued treatment for reasons other than death or 
an administrative reason. The mean percentage 
of possible treatment time that patients took the 
trial medication was 80%, 84%, and 82%, respec-
tively. (The mean doses of the drugs, according 
to status with respect to diabetes, are presented 
in Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix.)
Outcomes
Overall, death from cardiovascular causes or 
hospitalization for heart failure (the primary 
outcome) occurred in 770 patients (32.9%) in the 
combination-therapy group (11.7 events per 100 
person-years), in 791 patients (33.8%) in the aliski-
ren group (12.1 events per 100 person-years), 
and in 808 patients (34.6%) in the enalapril

Aliskiren, Enalapril, or Aliskiren and Enalapril in Heart Failure
group (12.4 events per 100 person-years) (Fig. 2A 
and Table 2). The hazard ratio in the combina-
tion-therapy group, as compared with the enal-
april group, was 0.93 (95% confidence interval 
[CI], 0.85 to 1.03; P 
= 
0.17); the hazard ratio in 
the aliskiren group, as compared with the enala-
pril group, was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.90 to 1.10; 
P 
= 
0.91 for superiority). Although the noninfe-
riority margin of 1.104 was met with the use 
of the 95% confidence interval, the one-sided 
P value of 0.0184 did not fulfill the prespecified 
requirement of a P value of 0.0123 or less. A 
sensitivity analysis that included only patients 
who received the assigned trial regimen gave 
consistent results, as did an analysis in which 
data that were collected after regulatory censor-
ing were included (Tables S5 and S6 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix).
There were no significant between-group dif-
ferences in the secondary outcome (change in 
the KCCQ clinical summary score at 12 months) 
or in selected prespecified exploratory outcomes 
(Table 2 and Fig. 2). The exploratory composite 
renal outcome (the composite of death from re-
nal causes, end-stage renal disease, or doubling 
of the serum creatinine level) occurred signifi-
cantly more frequently in the combination-ther-
apy group than in the enalapril group (Table 2). 
At 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months, the de-
crease from baseline in the NT-proBNP concen-
tration was greater in the combination-therapy 
group than in the enalapril group. (See also Ta-
bles S7 and S8 in the Supplementary Appendix.)
In persons without diabetes, the primary out-
come occurred in 574 of 1675 patients (34.3%) in 
the combination-therapy group (10.6 events per 
100 person-years) and in 592 of 1684 patients 
(35.2%) in the enalapril group (11.1 events per 
100 person-years; hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 
0.85 to 1.07; P 
= 
0.46). In persons with diabetes, 
the primary outcome occurred in 196 of 665 pa-
tients (29.5%) in the combination-therapy group 
(16.3 events per 100 person years) and in 216 of 
652 patients (33.1%) in the enalapril group (18.8 
events per 100 person-years; hazard ratio, 0.86; 
95% CI, 0.71 to 1.04; P 
= 
0.13; P 
= 
0.35 for inter-
action). The effect of combination therapy as 
compared with enalapril was consistent for the 
primary outcome across the prespecified sub-
groups, as was the effect of aliskiren as compared 
with enalapril. A similar consistency according 
to subgroup was seen for the outcome of death 
from any cause. (See also Figs. S1 and S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix.)
Safety
Hypotension, renal dysfunction, and hyperkale-
mia occurred more commonly with combination 
therapy than with enalapril. The rates of these 
adverse effects were similar in the aliskiren 
group and the enalapril group, except for hypo-
tension, which was more common with enalapril

than with aliskiren (Table 3). The increase in the 
rates of renal dysfunction and hyperkalemia 
with combination therapy was greater among 
patients who were being treated with an aldoste-
rone antagonist at baseline than among those 
who were not (Table S9 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). The most frequent adverse events and 
serious adverse events are summarized in Tables 
S10 and S11 in the Supplementary Appendix.
As compared with the value at randomization, 
the mean systolic blood pressure at 4 months 
was significantly lower with combination ther-
apy than with enalapril (difference vs. enalapril, 
−1.84 mm Hg; 95% CI, −2.70 to −0.98; P<0.001).

The comparison of aliskiren with enalapril was a test for superiority. For noninferiority, the one­sided P value was 0.0184, which did not fulfill the prespecified requirement of a P value 
of 0.0123 or less. For all outcomes other than the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) clinical summary score (on a scale from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating 
better health­related quality of life), the data are shown as number of patients with an event as a fraction of the number of patients at risk, and the treatment effect is shown as the haz­
ard ratio and the 95% confidence interval (CI), which were calculated with the use of Cox regression models with treatment, dose stratum, and NYHA class (I or II vs. III or IV) as fixed­
effect factors and the log­transformed NT­proBNP value at baseline as a covariate. P values are two­sided and were not adjusted for multiple comparisons.
†  
The KCCQ score was evaluated with the use of a repeated­measures analysis with the baseline value as a covariate and treatment, dose stratum, NYHA class, and visit as factors and a 
visit­by­treatment interaction; a score of 0 was used in patients who died. The results are shown as the least­square mean change from baseline ±SE, and the treatment effect is shown 
as the least­square mean of the difference with the 95% confidence interval. Scores were available at 12 months for 1811 patients in the combination­therapy group, for 1796 in the 
aliskiren group, and for 1804 in the enalapril group.
‡  
The full list of prespecified exploratory outcomes is provided in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix.
§  
The composite renal outcome consisted of death from renal causes, end­stage renal disease (initiation of dialysis, renal transplantation, or a serum creatinine concentration of >6.0 mg 
per deciliter [530 μmol per liter]), or a doubling of serum creatinine from baseline (to more than the upper limit of the normal range) that was sustained for at least 1 month.

The difference between the mean values in the

Discussion
We found that the addition of the renin inhibitor 
aliskiren to enalapril did not result in a lower 
risk of death from cardiovascular causes or hos-
pitalization due to heart failure, as compared 
with enalapril alone, but did cause more hypo-
tension, renal dysfunction, and hyperkalemia, 
despite the active run-in period that resulted in 
the exclusion of patients who had these prob-
lems on initial exposure to the treatments stud-
ied. In our trial, patients with diabetes had the 
treatment stopped prematurely because of regu-
latory concern about the safety of aliskiren added 
to an ACE inhibitor in such persons.15-19 Because 
of this, we revised our statistical analysis plan to 
prespecify examination of the effect of combina-
tion therapy, as compared with enalapril alone, 
in patients without diabetes.13 This analysis 
showed the same effect of combination therapy 
as in the trial overall.
Our findings regarding combination therapy 
contrast with those of earlier trials involving 
patients with heart failure in which the addition 
of an ARB to an ACE inhibitor was of some 
benefit.5,6 Although renin inhibition is pharma-
cologically distinct from angiotensin-receptor 
blockade, the difference between our trial and 
the other trials is unlikely to be explained by 
differences in the treatments used.9-11 The more

Aliskiren, Enalapril, or Aliskiren and Enalapril in Heart Failure
likely explanation is that neither earlier trial re-
quired an evidence-based dose of ACE inhibitor, 
whereas our trial did.
The absence of additional benefit with com-
bination therapy in our study was not due to a 
lack of incremental inhibition of the renin–angio-
tensin system, because the addition of aliskiren 
to enalapril led to more adverse effects that are 
indicative of greater blockade of this system. A 
similar excess of adverse effects was noted when 
only half the full dose of valsartan was added to 
an evidence-based dose of captopril in patients 
after myocardial infarction.7 Collectively, these 
findings suggest that there is a therapeutic ceil-
ing for blockade of the renin–angiotensin system 
beyond which there is little or no additional ef-
ficacy and only more adverse effects. These find-
ings also argue against the suggestion that the 
benefit of sacubitril–valsartan over enalapril could 
be due to more intense blockade of the renin–
angiotensin system.20,21 The lack of benefit of 
added aliskiren was not due to inadequate statis-
tical power, despite regulatory censoring of data 
from patients with diabetes (and from some 
others). Our trial was event-driven, and the re-
quired number of patients had a primary out-
come. Also, despite the high rate of discontinu-
ation of the randomly assigned therapy by the 
end of the trial, overall exposure to the treat-
ment was satisfactory.
A notable feature of our trial was the regula-
tory intervention in which the drug was discon-
tinued in patients with diabetes during the 
course of the trial.13 This intervention was 
based on the findings of possible harm from 
aliskiren in patients with diabetes in two other 
trials (ASTRONAUT and ALTITUDE).15,16,19 Our 
trial included a large proportion of patients with 
diabetes, who had exposure to aliskiren for a 
median of 24 months despite truncated follow-
up. We did not identify worse outcomes in the 
patients with diabetes who were treated with 
combination therapy than in those who were 
treated with enalapril alone. Patients with diabe-
tes who were treated with aliskiren monotherapy 
had outcomes similar to those of patients treat-
ed with enalapril. A statement of the data and

cerning this regulatory intervention has now 
been published in the Journal.22
In conclusion, in patients with heart failure 
and reduced ejection fraction, we found no ben-
efit from the addition of a renin inhibitor to an 
evidence-based dose of enalapril. Our findings 
also do not support the use of a renin inhibitor 
as an alternative to an ACE inhibitor, because 
the prespecified criterion for noninferiority was 
not met.
