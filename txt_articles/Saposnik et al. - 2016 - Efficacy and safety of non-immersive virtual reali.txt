 Our aim was to compare the safety and efficacy of virtual reality with recreational therapy on 
motor recovery in patients after an acute ischaemic stroke.
Methods—In this randomised, controlled, single-blind, parallel-group trial we enrolled adults 
(aged 18–85 years) who had a first-ever ischaemic stroke and a motor deficit of the upper 
extremity score of 3 or more (measured with the Chedoke-McMaster scale) within 3 months of 
randomisation from 14 in-patient stroke rehabilitation units from four countries (Canada [11], 
Argentina [1], Peru [1], and Thailand [1]). Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) by a 
computer-generated assignment at enrolment to receive a programme of structured, task-oriented, 
upper extremity sessions (ten sessions, 60 min each) of either non-immersive virtual reality using 
the Nintendo Wii gaming system (VRWii) or simple recreational activities (playing cards, bingo, 
Jenga, or ball game) as add-on therapies to conventional rehabilitation over a 2 week period. All 
investigators assessing outcomes were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was 
upper extremity motor performance measured by total time to complete the Wolf Motor Function 
Test (WMFT) at the end of the 2 week intervention period, analysed in the intention-to-treat 
population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NTC01406912.
Findings—The study was done between May 12, 2012, and Oct 1, 2015. We randomly assigned 
141 patients: 71 received VRWii therapy and 70 received recreational activity. 121 (86%) patients 
(59 in the VRWii group and 62 in the recreational activity group) completed the final assessment 
and were included in the primary analysis. Each group improved WMFT performance time 
relative to baseline (decrease in median time from 43·7 s [IQR 26·1–68·0] to 29·7 s [21·4–45·2], 
32·0% reduction for VRWii vs 38·0 s [IQR 28·0–64·1] to 27·1 s [21·2–45·5], 28·7% reduction for 
recreational activity). Mean time of conventional rehabilitation during the trial was similar 
between groups (VRWii, 373 min [SD 322] vs recreational activity, 397 min [345] ; p=0·70) as 
was the total duration of study intervention (VRWii, 528 min [SD 155] vs recreational activity, 541 
min [142]; p=0·60). Multivariable analysis adjusted for baseline WMFT score, age, sex, baseline 
Chedoke-McMaster, and stroke severity revealed no significant difference between groups in the 
primary outcome (adjusted mean estimate of difference in WMFT: 4·1 s, 95% CI −14·4 to 22·6). 
There were three serious adverse events during the trial, all deemed to be unrelated to the 
interventions (seizure after discharge and intracerebral haemorrhage in the recreational activity 
group and heart attack in the VRWii group). Overall incidences of adverse events and serious 
adverse events were similar between treatment groups.
Interpretation—In patients who had a stroke within the 3 months before enrolment and had 
mild-to-moderate upper extremity motor impairment, non-immersive virtual reality as an add-on 
therapy to conventional rehabilitation was not superior to a recreational activity intervention in 
improving motor function, as measured by WMFT. Our study suggests that the type of task used in 
motor rehabilitation post-stroke might be less relevant, as long as it is intensive enough and task-
specific. Simple, low-cost, and widely available recreational activities might be as effective as 
innovative non-immersive virtual reality technologies.

Introduction
Every year about 15 million people have a new or recurrent stroke worldwide,1,2 and about 
two thirds of stroke survivors have motor deficits associated with diminished quality of life.3

 The greatest burden occurs in low-income and middle-income countries lacking the basic 
infrastructure facilities to support resource-intensive interventions in stroke rehabilitation.4,5
Conventional rehabilitation techniques, including motor relearning, neurodevelopmental 
therapy, or proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation, are similarly effective in improving 
motor function.6–10 However, conventional rehabilitation can be resource-intensive and 
costly, often requiring specialised facilities not always widely available.11,12 Virtual reality 
is a novel rehabilitation strategy regarded as an enjoyable alternative to enhance motor 
recovery after stroke where specialised facilities are scarce. Virtual reality ranges from non-
immersive to fully immersive, depending on the degree to which the user is isolated from the 
physical surroundings when interacting with the virtual environment.13 A variety of non-
immersive video-game systems developed by the entertainment industry for home use have 
made this technology less costly and more accessible for potential rehabilitation 
interventions.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed and the Cochrane Database for relevant articles published from Jan 
1, 1980, to Dec 18, 2015. We used the keywords “virtual reality” combined with “stroke” 
and “stroke rehabilitation”. We restricted the search to articles published in English. We 
identified 12 small, single-centre studies (including our EVREST pilot study); when the 
results from these studies were combined in a meta-analysis published in a Cochrane 
review published in 2015, virtual reality-assisted rehabilitation appeared to confer modest 
improvement in motor function of the upper extremity after stroke. Considerable 
heterogeneity was observed, as each study included five to 40 participants (less than 200 
participants in total). Most of the studies compared non-immersive virtual reality added 
to conventional rehabilitation versus conventional rehabilitation alone, with no active 
control.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this multicentre study is the first randomised trial to compare the 
effect of non-immersive virtual reality and recreational activity (active control) as add-on 
therapies to conventional rehabilitation after an acute stroke. Outcomes were assessed at 
the end of the 2 week intervention and again 4 weeks post-intervention. We found no 
significant difference in motor recovery after stroke between non-immersive virtual 
reality and simple recreational activities, although each group showed a significant 
improvement relative to baseline.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our findings suggest that added intensity of training, whether with virtual reality or other 
simple and inexpensive arm activities (eg, playing cards or dominoes), improves early 
motor recovery of the upper limb after stroke. Considering that the greatest burden of 
stroke occurs in low-income and middle-income countries with constrained resources and 
limited access to technologies and rehabilitation therapists, simple, low-cost, high-

 intensity, and task-specific home-based therapies appear comparable with virtual reality 
to optimise motor recovery post-stroke.
Despite promising results from initial studies,14 meta-analyses have suggested marginal 
benefits of virtual reality systems in improving motor function of the upper extremity after 
stroke.15 Benefits were typically observed when the intervention was done in the first 6 
months after stroke.15 However, some of the studies included16–18 in one meta-analysis19 
compared virtual reality added to conventional rehabilitation with conventional rehabilitation 
alone with no active control. Such a design might allow more treatment time among patients 
receiving virtual reality interventions, creating an imbalance in the total rehabilitation time 
between groups that might explain the observed benefits, although total intervention time 
was not reported.14,15,19 Despite this limited evidence, virtual reality is commonly used in 
clinical practice and recommended in stroke guidelines.20–22
To address confounding factors in previous studies, we did a multicentre, single-blind, 
parallel-group, randomised trial to compare the effect of non-immersive virtual reality with 
recreational therapy (active control), with both added to customary conventional 
rehabilitation, on motor recovery in patients after acute stroke. We hypothesised that using 
non-immersive virtual reality after an ischaemic stroke would result in better motor recovery 
of the upper extremity required for activities of daily living than with recreational therapy.
Methods
Study design and participants
This controlled, single-blind, parallel-group, randomised trial was done at 14 participating 
rehabilitation centres from four countries (Canada [11]: Toronto, Calgary, London, 
Mississauga, North York, St Johns, Hamilton, Montreal; Argentina [1]: Buenos Aires; Peru 
[1]: Lima; Thailand [1]: Bangkok). We included patients aged 18–85 years who had a first-
time ischaemic stroke within 3 months of enrolment and had a mild-to-moderate motor 
disability (defined as Chedoke-McMaster Stroke Assessment stage >3).23,24 Diagnosis of 
acute stroke was confirmed by neuroimaging (CT or MRI), neurological assessment, and 
Chedoke-McMaster inclusion criteria.
Potential participants were excluded if they had no disability in the upper extremity (arm 
components of the Chedoke-McMaster scale=7); were unable to follow instructions; had a 
pre-stroke modified Rankin score of 2 or higher; were medically unstable or had 
uncontrolled hypertension; had a severe illness with a life expectancy of less than 3 months; 
experienced unstable angina or had a myocardial infarction within 3 months; had a history of 
seizures or epilepsy (except for febrile seizures of childhood); were participating in another 
clinical trial involving an investigational drug or physical therapy; or had any condition that 
might put the patient at risk (ie, known shoulder subluxation or fracture) at study entry.
Data management, research coordination, and statistical analyses were done at the Applied 
Health Research Centre of the Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute of St Michael’s Hospital, 
Toronto, Canada. Operational procedures, guidelines for the implementation of both arms of 
the study, and the consent form were approved by the ethics review boards at St Michael’s

 Hospital and at each participating institution. Written informed consent was obtained from 
all patients at each participating institution.
Randomisation and masking
Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) within 2 months of stroke onset to non-immersive 
virtual reality using the Nintendo Wii (Nintendo Co., Ltd, Kyoto, Japan) gaming system 
(VRWii) or recreational activities by computer-generated assignment at enrolment (stratified 
by site), employing random permuted blocks of sizes 2 and 4, which were assigned remotely 
via the internet. The study coordinator (JH) and patients participating in this study were not 
masked to the intervention group. To limit the participants from knowing how to use the 
games beforehand, and to ensure that other caregivers and support staff were not aware of 
patient allocation, all study interventions were done by dedicated trial staff out of sight of 
ward staff. Trial staff and patients were instructed not to divulge the intervention allocation 
to caregivers or other ward staff. Interventions were not recorded in the medical record. All 
baseline, post-intervention, and 4 week follow-up assessments were done by trained 
outcome assessors (DC and others) who were masked to the patient’s treatment allocation.
Procedures
Within their in-patient stroke rehabilitation centres, patients were assessed at baseline 
(randomisation), at 2 weeks (post-intervention), and at 4 weeks (follow-up) by the trained 
outcome assessors. The intensity and duration of the interventions was the same in the 
VRWii and recreational activity groups, consisting of an intensive programme of ten 
sessions, 60 min each, over a 2 week period. A rehabilitation therapist administered the 
interventions (either VRWii or recreational activity) at each participating facility, in a one-to-
one session providing feedback to avoid inappropriate compensatory movements. Patients 
were not allowed to play against each other. Further details are described in the protocol 
(appendix).
We used the Wii Nintendo gaming system as a paradigm of non-immersive virtual reality 
devices that are inexpensive, easy to use, comprising simple graphics, and with readily 
available commercial games. We used commercially available software, including Wii 
Sports and Game Party 3. Progression through the intervention allowed participants to 
choose some specific activities within those games (last 30 min of the intervention) based on 
their capabilities and interest, with the goals of enhancing flexibility, range of motion, 
strength, and coordination of the affected arm. The recreational activity was designed as a 
customary active control with similar intensity and complexity to simulate the skills required 
in the VRWii group and favouring motivation. As in the VRWii group, progression through 
the intervention allowed patients to choose specific activities (playing cards, bingo, Jenga, or 
ball game; appendix).
Outcomes
The primary endpoint was motor function at the end of the 2 week interventions as measured 
by the time in doing a number of tasks on the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT). We used 
an abbreviated version of WMFT that included six tasks (hand to table, hand to box, reach 
and retrieve, lift can, lift pencil, and fold towel),25 and added grip strength and flip a card

 tasks. Secondary endpoints at the end of the 2 week interventions were: gross manual 
dexterity assessed using the Box and Block Test (BBT); quality of life after stroke and hand 
function, both measured by the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS); score on the functional 
independence measure (FIM); independence for activities of daily living as measured by the 
Barthel Index; score on the Modified Rankin Scale; and grip strength measured using a 
dynamometer. All outcome measures were also assessed 4 weeks post-intervention, which 
was about 3 months after stroke onset. Additionally, at the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, 
kinematics of limb movement were measured using the Reaching Performance Scale (RPS; 
appendix) at the beginning and end of the intervention to determine the characteristics of 
motor learning in both groups. The RPS was also used to assess compensatory movements.
Death, life-threatening events (stroke, myocardial infarction, and fracture), hospital 
readmissions, or new disability leading to prolongation of existing hospitalisation were 
considered serious adverse events. Minor adverse events included the proportion of patients 
experiencing intervention-related pain, dizziness, light-headedness, back or shoulder pain, or 
muscle aches during the study period. We also measured patients’ perceived exertion and 
fatigue after each treatment session by using the Borg Perceived Level of Exertion scale 
(excessive fatigue defined as any score >13 points).
Statistical analysis
The study sample size of 140 was calculated according to the results of the EVREST pilot 
study.26 This sample size would allow detection of change at the patient level of 5 s using 
the WMFT27 and the SD was estimated to be 9 s. If only 70% of patients completed the 
intervention (leaving 52 in each group), there would still be 80% power to detect the 5 s 
difference.
The primary outcome analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population and examined 
the total WMFT score tasks. Adverse events are reported descriptively. A two-sided p value 
of less than 0·05 was considered statistically significant. Despite the one-sided nature of the 
clinical hypothesis, the primary outcome was tested with a two-sided alternative to be 
statistically conservative. Statistical analysis was done in the R language for statistical 
computing (version 3.3.23; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). A 
linear regression model was constructed for the primary outcome, controlling for baseline 
WMFT score, treatment group, age, sex, baseline Chedoke-McMaster score, and stroke 
severity. A sensitivity analysis was done to determine whether patients who were not able to 
complete the test and were given a score of 120 significantly affected the outcome. An 
examination of the residual plots did not suggest concerns regarding model assumptions (eg, 
normality of errors) and no transformations of the outcome were needed. A planned 
subgroup analysis included age, sex, handedness, stroke severity, Chedoke-McMaster score, 
time from stroke onset to randomisation, and FIM.
The average total therapy time, the average therapy time per session, and differences 4 
weeks post-intervention from baseline in primary and secondary outcomes were computed 
for each group, along with 95% CIs. For relevant clinical outcomes, descriptive statistics 
(mean and SD or median and IQR) were computed for each assessment. Inferential analyses 
comparing treatment groups for the secondary outcomes also employed a linear model in

 which the baseline value was adjusted for in addition to age, sex, baseline Chedoke-
McMaster score, and stroke severity. Additionally, the effectiveness of masking of the 
outcome assessors was examined by asking them to guess which treatment group the patient 
was in. The proportion correctly guessed was compared with a χ2 test. The trial is registered 
with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NTC01406912.

Results
We screened 893 individuals between May 12, 2012, and Oct 1, 2015. The most common 
reason for exclusion was motor deficits that were too mild (282 [32%] of 893 patients). Of 
the screened individuals, 141 eligible patients were randomly assigned: 71 patients were 
assigned to VRWii and 70 patients were assigned to the recreational activity (active control) 
group. 59 (83%) of 71 patients in the VRWii group and 62 (89%) of 70 patients in the 
recreational activity group completed the 2 week intervention and were included in the 
primary outcome analysis; 47 (66%) of 71 patients in the VRWii group and 54 (77%) of 70 
patients in the recreational activity group completed the 4 week post-intervention assessment 
and were included in secondary analyses.
In the VRWii group, four patients discontinued after the training session, whereas none 
discontinued in the recreational activity group. 13 (18%) of 71 patients in the VRWii group 
and 13 (19%) of 70 patients in the recreational activity group did not complete the ten 
scheduled sessions (figure 1). Mean age of all patients was 62 years (SD 12). Demographic 
and baseline clinical characteristics, including time from stroke onset, were similar between 
groups (table 1). Mean time of conventional rehabilitation during the trial was similar 
between groups (VRWii 373 min [SD 322] vs recreational activity 397 min [345]; p=0·70). 
There was no difference in the total duration of each study intervention (VRWii 528 min 
[SD 155] vs recreational activity, 541 min [142]; p=0·60). We found no evidence of failure 
of concealment at the end of the study; the masked assessors correctly identified recreational 
activity patients on 55% (95% CI 43–67) of occasions versus 67% (55–77) for VRWii 
patients (p=0·24 for a difference between groups).
Analysis of the primary outcome showed improvements in the median WMFT performance 
time from baseline to the end of intervention in both groups (decrease in median time from 
43·7 s [IQR 26·1–68·0] to 29·7 s [21·4–45·2], a 32·0% reduction for VRWii vs decrease from 
38·0 s [IQR 28·0–64·1] to 27·1 s [21·2–45·5], a 28·7% reduction for recreational activity). 
Multivariable analysis revealed no significant difference between groups at the end of the 
intervention with respect to WMFT performance (adjusted between-group mean difference 
estimate: 4·1 s [95% CI −14·4 to 22·6], p=0·469) or 4-weeks post-intervention (−14·2 s 
[−52·0 to 23·7, p=0·346; table 2, figure 2A, B).

 There were no differences in the secondary outcome measures between groups (table 2, 
appendix) with the exception of better performance in the BBT for the recreational activity 
group at the end of the intervention (30·9 [SD 13·2] vs 27·2 [15·5] blocks moved; adjusted p 
value 0·018). Patients in both groups had similar scores with respect to grip strength, 
recovery in activities for daily living measured by the Barthel Index, hand function, and 
quality of life at the end of the 2 week intervention. Similar results were observed 4 weeks 
post-intervention. Both groups showed a non-significant increase in the quality of movement 
of the affected arm as measured by the RPS compared with baseline (for the close target: 
mean RPS for recreational activity 1·66 [SD 0·53], 11% improvement vs VRWii 1·47 [0·60], 
11% improvement [adjusted p value 0·81]; for the far target: recreational activity 1·22 [1·10], 
9% improvement vs VRWii 1·52 [0·28], 12% improvement [adjusted p value 0·83]). The 
multivariable analysis revealed no difference in the quality of movements between groups 
(table 2).
There was no evidence of heterogeneity of effect across any of the prespecified subgroups 
(age, sex, handedness, stroke severity, functional arm assessment [Chedoke-McMaster 
score], time from stroke onset to randomisation, and functional assessment scale [FIM]; 
figure 3). A sensitivity analysis excluding patients who were not able to complete the 
WMFT at baseline (54 in the VRWii group and 61 in the recreational activity group) 
revealed no difference between groups (p=0·93; data not shown).
There were three serious adverse events during the trial, all deemed to be unrelated to the 
interventions. Two serious adverse events occurred in the recreational activity group (seizure 
after discharge and intracerebral haemorrhage) and one in the VRWii group (heart attack). 
Overall incidences of adverse events and serious adverse events were similar between 
treatment groups (table 3).
Discussion
The EVREST study is the first randomised trial designed and powered to evaluate the 
effectiveness of video-game-based, non-immersive virtual reality (VRWii) compared with 
recreational activity (active control) as add-on therapies to conventional rehabilitation early 
after an acute stroke. In this trial, patients randomly assigned to both groups had an average 
of 30% and 40% improvement in motor performance at the end of the 2 week intervention 
and 4 weeks post-intervention, respectively. Contrary to our hypothesis, there was no 
significant difference in hand function, grip strength, motor performance, activities of daily 
living, quality of movement, or quality of life between groups either at the end of the 
intervention or 4 weeks post-intervention. Of note, there were no differences in the duration 
of the assigned interventions or total time of conventional rehabilitation between groups, 
allowing a fair comparison between groups. The results remained unaltered after adjusting 
for potential confounders (age, sex, baseline performance measures, and stroke severity). No 
prespecified subgroups appeared to benefit from the VRWii intervention.
Some limitations of the study deserve mention. The intervention group received non-
immersive virtual reality technology because it is low cost, less complex, and easier to 
deliver than immersive virtual reality systems. It is possible that immersive hospital-based

 systems could provide more beneficial results. However, we would argue that our neutral 
results are compelling because they are based on patients who fully complied with the 
interventions; the non-completion rate was similar between groups and there was no obvious 
difference in baseline characteristics of those who did not complete the interventions. The 
duration of our intervention can be considered short. Nevertheless, it is similar to other 
virtual reality interventions used in meta-analysis of previous positive studies.15,19 Another 
potential limitation is the lack of an additional study group receiving conventional therapy 
alone. However, this approach has been criticised by artificially creating potential benefits to 
the virtual reality technology group as these patients actually receive longer therapy than 
those receiving conventional therapy alone.
It is possible that a combination of different factors explain our neutral results compared 
with previous, more promising findings of virtual reality. For example, the use of an active 
control group and the greater variability of the intervention across centres in a multicentre 
design might have attenuated the mild effects of virtual reality previously observed in small, 
single-centre studies.28,29 Indeed, the residual estimate of SD for the WMFT after the 
intervention was considerably larger than assumed in planning this study. However, there 
was no evidence of treatment effect in any of the outcomes.
Questions remain about the ideal intensity of physiotherapy in conventional rehabilitation to 
improve motor function.30 There is a trade-off between the technological appeal associated 
with video gaming and the simplicity and lower costs of using recreational therapy. Future 
studies should help identify the best strategy to optimise motor recovery based on patients’ 
preferences and availability of these interventions in a particular clinical setting. Future work 
could also study if virtual reality affects more subtle tasks than those reflected by the 
WMFT. However, taken together, the consistency of the results and the diverse domains 
evaluated by the different outcome measures presented here suggest we were unlikely to 
have missed a clinically important treatment effect. Virtual reality requires higher cognitive 
demands by extra spatial transformation of uncoupled eye–hand movements while looking at 
the television screen than the direct visual and proprioceptive feedback of a recreational 
activity.31 It is possible that these differences play a part in explaining our results.
Our study suggests that the type of task used in motor rehabilitation post-stroke might be 
less relevant, as long as it is intensive enough and task-specific. This notion is supported by 
findings in previous studies applying innovative technologies (eg, arm robotics) with active 
control groups showing the interventions were beneficial compared with no active treatment, 
but not better than active controls.32–34 Given the rapid adoption of virtual reality in stroke 
rehabilitation, our results reinforce the importance of testing interventions using randomised, 
multicentre trials that are powered to examine clinically important differences between 
groups. Moreover, although we expect that technology might enhance relearning of motor 
pathways by intensifying neuro-rehabilitation, simple motor tasks (that could be 
implemented worldwide) appear at least as safe and efficacious.
Our results have practical implications for stroke rehabilitation worldwide. Considering that 
the greatest burden of stroke occurs in low-income and middle-income countries with 
constrained resources and limited access to technologies and rehabilitation therapists,1,4 
Saposnik et al.

 simple, low-cost, high-intensity, task-specific, home-based therapies might be considered to 
be comparable with virtual reality in optimising motor recovery.28 Additional investments in 
virtual reality might not need to be made in resource-limited environments. People with 
stroke should be made aware of these activities (eg, playing cards or bingo) in addition to 
conventional therapy.
In summary, EVREST used a wireless, non-immersive virtual reality technology 
intervention in stroke rehabilitation to improve motor function. Virtual reality is safe, but 
showed no significant benefits as an add-on therapy to conventional rehabilitation when 
compared with recreational activity (active control). Our study suggests that the type of task 
used in motor rehabilitation post-stroke might not be so relevant, as long as it is intensive 
enough and task-specific. Simple, widely available, and inexpensive recreational activities 
might be as effective as innovative non-immersive virtual reality technologies.

 Figure 2. Median motor performance time (A) and change in motor performance (B) from 
baseline to the end of the intervention and 4 weeks post-intervention as measured by the Wolf 
Motor Function Test (WMFT)
WMFT is expressed as unadjusted median time (s) (A) and as change (%) relative to 
baseline (B), with a decrease indicating improvement. There was no significant difference 
between groups at the end of the intervention (p=0·469) or 4 weeks post-intervention 
(p=0·346) after adjustment for age, sex, baseline WMFT, stroke severity, and Chedoke-
McMaster scores. VRWii=non-immersive virtual reality Wii group.
