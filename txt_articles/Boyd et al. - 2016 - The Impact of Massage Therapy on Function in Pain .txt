Disclosure: The Evidence for Massage Therapy (EMT)
Working Group (diverse stake-holders making up the
steering committee and subject matter experts) contrib-
uted to the protocol development and provided input
throughout the entire project; all analyses were con-
ducted independently by Samueli Institute. All recom-
mendations set forth in this report were made
collectively with the EMT Working Group and Samueli
Institute during an expert round table and are based on
the evidence revealed through the systematic review
and gaps that emerged through the process.
Abstract
Purpose. Pain is multi-dimensional and may be bet-
ter addressed through a holistic, biopsychosocial
approach. Massage therapy is commonly practiced
among patients seeking pain management; however,
its efficacy is unclear. This systematic review and
meta-analysis is the first to rigorously assess the
quality of massage therapy research and evidence for
its efficacy in treating pain, function-related and
health-related quality of life in cancer populations.
Methods. Key databases were searched from incep-
tion through February 2014. Eligible randomized
controlled trials were assessed for methodological
quality using the SIGN 50 Checklist. Meta-analysis
was applied at the outcome level. A diverse steering
committee
interpreted
the
results
to
develop
recommendations.
Results. Twelve high quality and four low quality
studies were subsequently included in the review.
Results demonstrate massage therapy is effective
for treating pain compared to no treatment [stan-
dardized mean difference (SMD) 5 2.20] and active
(SMD 5 20.55) comparators. Compared to active
comparators, massage therapy was also found to
be beneficial for treating fatigue (SMD 5 21.06) and
anxiety (SMD 5 21.24).
Conclusion. Based on the evidence, weak recom-
mendations are suggested for massage therapy,
compared to an active comparator, for the treatment
of pain, fatigue, and anxiety. No recommendations
were suggested for massage therapy compared to
no treatment or sham control based on the available
literature to date. This review addresses massage
therapy safety, research challenges, how to address
identified research gaps, and necessary next steps
for implementing massage therapy as a viable pain
management option for cancer pain populations.

 Introduction
Public Health Significance of Cancer Pain
Pain is the most common and debilitating symptom
among cancer patients. While the exact prevalence of
pain varies depending on the type and stage of cancer,
research shows that pain generally affects over 50% of
those undergoing cancer therapy and up to 90% with
advanced cancer experience pain [1]. According to a
2007 meta-analysis, which pooled data from 52 studies,
the prevalence of pain was found to be approximately
59% among patients undergoing active cancer treat-
ment and over 50% across all cancer types, with the
highest pooled prevalence of 70% among head/neck
cancer patients [2]. These figures convey that cancer
pain is perhaps not adequately addressed by the cur-
rent healthcare system and underscore the significant
challenges faced by treating oncologists and other
medical
professionals
in
the
field
of
cancer
pain
management.
Cancer pain can range from mild to severe and from
acute to chronic. Pain management can be challenging;
not only can cancer pain be spontaneous, as in the
case with the emergence of breakthrough pain [3] (i.e.,
sudden, transient exacerbation of pain intensity in pa-
tients with stable and controlled chronic pain) despite
continued administration of analgesics [4], but it can
also affect patients physically, emotionally, socially, and
spiritually. Patients often experience significant anxiety
and depression [5,6], as well as insomnia, fatigue,
weakness, and other complications that can exacerbate
each other, impair normal daily activities, and negatively
impact quality of life [7–9].
Current Treatment Approaches and Challenges
Pharmacologic interventions (i.e., non-opiods, opiods,
adjuvant medications), as well as interventional tech-
niques (e.g., nerve blocks, local anesthetics, surgical in-
terventions) represent the mainstay of treatment for
cancer pain. Despite their wide use and clinical benefits
for controlling pain, however, these interventions are
also associated with potential risks for both drug addic-
tion and unwanted side effects (e.g., nausea, vomiting,
dizziness, confusion) [10]. Therefore, practitioners are
challenged with determining the correct dosage that will
adequately relieve pain without causing such side ef-
fects [11]. Studies have also suggested that medical
professionals, including oncologists and nurses, may
have inadequate tools, knowledge, and skills to accu-
rately be able to assess patient’s pain severity and ad-
minister the correct dosage of medications [11]. For
example, a discrepancy often exists between patient
and physician in judging both the severity of the pa-
tient’s pain and the affected areas of daily function, with
the physician generally underrating the patient’s pain in-
tensity and undertreating cancer pain [12]. In an effort to
minimize this discrepancy, many healthcare facilities
have begun to place a greater emphasis on obtaining
frequent assessments of the patient’s pain intensity, in
the form of patient self-report on pain and pain-related
needs.
Massage Therapy for Cancer Pain
Due to unsatisfactory results from conventional cancer
pain management [6], as well as the growing recognition
of the importance of establishing treatment goals based
on patients’ own criteria for meaningful and holistic pain
relief across physical, functional, and psychosocial do-
mains [8], a large number of cancer patients are seeking
out and utilizing complementary and integrative medi-
cine (CIM) therapies [6,13–15]. In fact, many cancer pa-
tients have turned to massage therapy [16] to help with
not only physical relaxation and relief from physical pain
but also emotional distress, functional ability, and overall
quality of life. In response to a growing demand for a
more holistic pain management approach for cancer pa-
tients, therapeutic massage is being used more in medi-
cal treatment programs to reduce pain and related
symptoms, as well as enhance personal sense of well-
being in such patients [17].
Despite its popularity and theoretical base supporting its
use, however, there is ongoing debate and conflicting
evidence regarding the efficacy of massage therapy for
cancer pain. Some reviews have found that massage
therapy does not significantly improve cancer pain
[18,19], while others suggest a positive impact of mas-
sage therapy on relieving cancer symptoms and side ef-
fects associated with intensive cancer treatment and
medications[20,21]. To date, there has not been a com-
prehensive systematic review that attempts to better un-
derstand both the scope of massage therapy as well its
full effects on various outcomes associated with cancer
pain that addresses the patient’s needs from a holistic
view.
Purpose
This current review provides a comprehensive, up-to-
date systematic review and meta-analysis that examines
a variety of outcomes to address the multi-dimensional
experience of pain in cancer patients from a biopsycho-
social perspective. In doing so, the review: (a) clearly
defines both concepts of (i) massage therapy, to dis-
solve taxonomy confusion and ensure transparency with
eligibility criteria and (ii) function, as approached from a
patient-centric perspective; (b) examines the efficacy of
massage therapy for treating cancer patients experienc-
ing acute or chronic pain that is affecting function-re-
lated (e.g., pain, activity, sleep, mood, stress) and other
(e.g., health-related quality of life, physiological) out-
comes of daily life; (c) describes the characteristics and
safety of massage therapy as reported in the current lit-
erature, and whether they adhere to the proposed
Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of
Massage (STRICT-M) Checklist; (d) synthesizes the evi-
dence to draw initial conclusions based on the current
state of the evidence for its application; and (e) identifies

 gaps in research areas to guide a future research
agenda.
Methodology
Overview of Methodological Approach
A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted
using Samueli Institute’s
systematic review process
known as the Rapid Evidence Assessment of Literature
(REALV
C ) [22], which has been used by a variety of orga-
nizations to date [23–27]. Specifically, (a) the Evidence
for Massage Therapy (EMT) Working Group, composed
of a diverse group of stakeholders including a full steer-
ing committee and subject matter experts, contributed
to defining the review’s protocol (i.e., research question,
concepts/definitions, eligibility criteria) to maximize the
review’s meaning and impact to the target audience; (b)
the systematic review team followed the developed pro-
tocol to independently evaluate the quantity and quality
of the available English, peer-reviewed literature in order
to (c) present the results to the EMT Working Group
who then interpreted the evidence to suggest recom-
mendations for the field. The protocol for this systematic
review is registered with PROSPERO under registration
number CRD42014008867.
Concepts and Definitions
The authors agreed to use a broad scope when con-
ducting the review, and consequently examined the
state of the science regarding the impact of massage
therapy on function for all individuals experiencing pain.
Rather than restricting the population up front, the au-
thors decided to allow the literature base to identify sub-
group populations and dictate decisions surrounding
which subgroups should be included and examined in
the review. This systematic review focuses on the sub-
group of cancer pain populations. Other populations, in-
cluding
those
experiencing
pain
and
seeking
consultation from their general practitioner as well as
surgical patients [28,29], are assessed in other articles
within this series.
Pain
The authors agreed to rely on the Pain Management
Task Force’s definition for pain.
An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience asso-
ciated with actual or potential tissue damage or de-
scribed in terms of such damage. Pain is always
subjective. Pain can be acute or chronic [30].
Massage Therapy
After reviewing several definitions of massage therapy
[28,31,32], the authors decided to use the following
broad definition of massage therapy to adequately
capture the majority of interventions typically recognized
as massage therapy.
The systematic manipulation of soft tissue with the
hands that positively affects and promotes healing, re-
duces stress, enhances muscle relaxation, improves lo-
cal circulation, and creates a sense of well-being.
Function
Pain is a multidimensional experience that affects vari-
ous function-related outcomes. Recognizing the need to
approach pain from a biopsychosocial and patient-cen-
tered point of view in order to address the entire patient,
the authors assess function-related outcomes of pain,
such as activity, sleep, mood and stress as well as
health-related quality of life (HrQoL) and physiological
(i.e., outcomes relating to one’s physiology including the
physical and chemical phenomena and processes in-
volved) outcomes.
Study Eligibility Criteria
Articles were included if they met all of the following cri-
teria: (a) cancer patients experiencing pain, as defined
above; (b) massage therapy, as defined above, adminis-
tered (i) alone as a therapy; (ii) as part of a multi-modal
intervention where massage effects can be separately
evaluated; or (iii) with the addition of techniques com-
monly used with massage, as pre-defined by the EMT
Working Group (i.e., external application of water, heat,
cold, lubricants, background music, aromas, essential
oils, and tools that may mimic the actions that can be
performed by the hands); (c) sham, no treatment, or ac-
tive comparator (i.e., those in which participants are ac-
tively receiving any type of intervention); (d) assessment
of at least one relevant function outcome, as defined
above; and (e) randomized controlled trial (RCT) study
design published in the English language. Additionally,
interventions were included if they were not necessarily
labeled as massage or massage therapy but included
the use of manual forces and soft-tissue deformation
as well as gliding, torsion, shearing, elongation, oscillat-
ing, percussive, and joint movement methods (i.e.,
touch, compression, gliding, percussion, friction, vibra-
tion, kneading, movement, positioning, stretching, hold-
ing) [28]. Note that interventions solely performed by
tools (e.g., chair massage) were excluded.
Search Strategy
Databases, including PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, and
PsycInfo,
were
searched
from
database
inception
through February 2014 according to the broad research
scope. Authors explored MeSH within MEDLINE and
consulted with experts in the field to determine the best
keywords to yield the most powerful search (see Figure
1 for PubMed search string). Variations of the search
strategy for the remaining databases are available upon
request from the primary author.

 Study Selection
Three reviewers (LX, AP, CP) independently screened ti-
tles and abstracts of the citations yielded from the lit-
erature search according to the pre-defined eligibility
criteria. A Cohen’s kappa for inter-rated agreement
of >0.90 was maintained throughout the entire screen-
ing phase. Disagreements about inclusion were resolved
through discussion and consensus, by one of the review
managers (CB, CC) or, ultimately, by involving the EMT
Working Group.
Methodological Quality Assessment and Data
Extraction
Methodological quality (i.e., risk of bias/internal validity) was
independently assessed by three reviewers (LX, AP, CP)
using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN)
50 Checklist [33] for RCTs, a validated and reliable assess-
ment tool widely used in the literature. The External Validity
Assessment Tool (EVATV
C ) [34] was used to measure the
generalizability of the intervention’s applicability to other in-
dividuals (i.e., external validity) and other settings (i.e.,
model validity) outside the confines of a study. The follow-
ing descriptive data was also extracted from included stud-
ies: type and stage of cancer, sample entered/completed,
intervention and control/comparison description and dos-
age, relevant function measures and corresponding results
and statistics, effect sizes, and author’s main conclusions.
The authors also noted whether power calculations to
achieve sufficient effect sizes and adverse events were re-
ported.

Proposed STRICT-M Checklist and Analysis
The Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical
Trials
of
Acupuncture
(STRICTA)
[35]
is
a
formal
extension of Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials
(CONSORT) [36] that expands the general content
of item five (surrounding the intervention description
specific to acupuncture) to improve the completeness
of
reporting
interventions
in
controlled
acupuncture
trials. Because complete and accurate trial reports can
facilitate
translation
and
replicability,
the
authors
extracted data similar to the STRICTA criteria and noted
whether
studies
included
this
data
in
reporting.
Subsequently, the authors refer to this STRICTA-based
checklist as the proposed Standards for Reporting
Interventions in Clinical Trials of Massage (STRICT-M)
[28].
Data Synthesis and Analysis
Meta-Analysis
When reported, the sample size, mean or pre-post dif-
ference, and standard deviation for each treatment
group was extracted. Effect sizes were calculated for
each comparison (i.e., massage vs. active comparator,
massage vs. sham, massage vs. no treatment) for the
functional outcomes related to pain: pain intensity/sever-
ity, activity, stress, mood (anxiety), sleep (fatigue), and
HrQoL, where available. If a study had more than one
active comparator (i.e., physical therapy or acupunc-
ture), the biostatistician randomly chose one active
comparator for analysis by flipping a coin. A minimum of
three studies was required to perform a meta-analysis
for each subset of data analyzed. An unbiased estimate
was calculated using Cohen’s d effect size for subgroup
analyses that pooled across several scales [37,38]. A
pooled random-effects estimate of the overall effect size
was estimated for all studies judged as clinically similar
enough to warrant a meta-analysis. The individual trial
outcomes were weighted by both within- and between-
study variation in this synthesis. For a reduction in pain
intensity/severity, fatigue, and anxiety, a negative effect

 size favors massage therapy treatment group over the
comparison arm (i.e., active comparator, sham or no
treatment group). For improved activity (i.e., increase in
range of motion) and HrQoL, a positive effect size favors
the massage therapy treatment group over the compari-
son arm (i.e., active comparator, sham or no treatment
group). Publication bias was also assessed using the
Egger regression asymmetry test [38,39]. Heterogeneity
was assessed using I2 and tested via Q statistics. For
pain intensity/severity, a clinical translation into the visual
analog scale (VAS), 0–100, was conducted for clinical
interpretation using a standard deviation of 25 points; a
20-mm difference on the VAS was considered clinically
relevant [40]. All meta-analyses were conducted with
Comprehensive Meta-analysis version 2.2 (Meta-analy-
sis.com, Englewood, NJ).
Evidence Synthesis
The EMT working group and systematic review team
convened to: (a) review the evidence revealed through
the systematic review and meta-analysis, and (b) further
synthesize the evidence in order to determine the overall
(i) confidence in the estimate of the effect; (ii) magnitude
of the effect; and (iii) evaluate safety as being reported
in the results; in order to provide an overall recommen-
dation concerning the benefit/risk for massage therapy.
The conclusions reached and recommendations made
are in no way to be construed as clinical guidelines, but
are rather recommendations about the benefit/risk of
massage therapy for cancer pain management, based
solely on the evidence from the systematic review
results.
Results
Characteristics of Included Studies
The
database
searches
yielded
3,678
articles
that
examined three subgroups of populations including
individuals with pain conditions for which they would
generally seek treatment from their general practitioner,
individuals with pain related to a surgical procedure and
those with cancer pain. Results regarding the first two
subgroups are reported elsewhere [28,29].
A total of 16 studies, ranging from 1990 through 2013
publication years, investigated the effect of massage
therapy on cancer pain populations (see Figure 2 for
Flow
Chart
of
included
studies).
Massage
tech-
niques named as massage[10,41–45], massage therapy
[46–52], Thai massage [53], therapeutic massage [54],
and lymphatic drainage [55] were compared to several
types of control/comparator arms including no treatment
[10,47,48,51],
standard
care
[46,53,54],
attention
[43,45,49], touch [50,54], usual care [10,52], caring
presence [54], quiet time [42], reading [41], and an
undescribed control [44]. Treatment dosages varied
from one single 10-minute session to 15 daily 45-minute
sessions over a 3-week course. In the 16 studies,
31.5% were male and 68.5% were female with the
mean
age
of
57.2
across
the
studies.
See
Supplementary Data Table S1 for full descriptions of all
included studies.
Methodological Quality of Included Studies
According to the SIGN 50 criteria, the majority of stud-
ies seemed to have minimal to no risk of bias detected,
with one high ( þþ) and 11 acceptable (þ) quality stud-
ies; four studies were low (0) quality. Most of the SIGN
criteria were addressed either adequately or well (see
Table 1). In fact, the majority of studies addressed an
appropriate and clearly focused question, dropouts,
baseline similarities, group differences, outcome reli-
ability
and
validity,
and
intention-to-treat
analyses.
Studies were equally divided regarding reporting ran-
domization procedures, with half addressing these pro-
cesses either well or adequately and the remaining
studies doing so poorly. Allocation concealment was
poorly addressed by most studies and all five multi-site
studies
[41,42,44,50,52]
addressed
site
differences
poorly.
EVAT evaluates the generalizability of study results to
other individuals and settings outside the confines of the
study. Over half of studies described the recruitment
(87.4%) and participation (53.8%) aspects of external
validity adequately, meaning that the populations being
studied and the source from which they came are un-
derstood well enough that results can be generalized to
other patients in real-life settings. Similarly, model valid-
ity was adequately reported in 53% of the studies, indi-
cating that the staff, places and facilities where patients
were treated were representative of the treatment that
the majority of patients would typically receive. See
Table 2 for details.
STRICT-M Analysis
The EMT Working Group and review team convened to
draft the proposed STRICT-M requirements, adapted
from the STRICTA Checklist [35], and analyzed the sys-
tematic review’s literature pool according to these pro-
posed requirements [28]. All studies (100.0%) described
the massage technique utilized and most (62.5%) in-
cluded the rationale for selecting the provided massage
treatment. While massage location (93.8%) and amount
of pressure (68.8%) were described by most studies,
other details were not. Only 18.8% and 31.3% of stud-
ies described the amount of time spent massaging each
location, and the extent to which treatments varied, re-
spectively. No studies used specific massage terms
when describing the massage protocols or included in-
formation about the type of response sought. Despite
this lack of detail, dosing regimens including frequency
(75.0%), duration (93.8%), and number (93.5%) of treat-
ment sessions over a specified time frame (87.5%) were
described by almost all studies. 42.9% of the studies
that
used
additional
massage-related
interventions

 eligible for inclusion in this review (i.e., essential oils,
aromatherapy) described these interventions well. All
studies described the setting in which massage was
performed. Although massage was primarily adminis-
tered in a hospital (n ¼ 12) [42–51,53–55], it was also
provided at the client/therapist’s home (n ¼ 3) [10,41,52]
and a hospice (n ¼ 1) [50] setting.
Four studies included one provider, while 12 included
more than one provider; of the studies that included
multiple providers, only four reported the exact number
of providers and only one described the interaction be-
tween providers. Almost all studies described the type
of
massage
practitioner
(87.5%);
however,
provider
qualifications were only described by 31.3% of studies.
Most providers were massage therapists (n ¼ 8) or some
type of unspecified therapist (n ¼ 3). Other types of pro-
viders included a nurse (n ¼ 2), healing-arts specialist
(n ¼ 1), caregiver (n ¼ 1), and a researcher trained in
massage (n ¼ 1). Based on the few studies that reported
practitioner qualifications, years of experience ranged
from six months to 10 years. Hours of supervised clini-
cal experience and didactic training were not discussed
by many studies; however, a few required practitioners
to undergo some sort of training program specific to the
study’s protocol. See Table 3 for full detail of the
STRICT-M analysis.
The control or comparator intervention was described by
the majority of studies (87.5%); however, the rationale for
using the selected interventions was only included by a
few studies (12.5%). Dosage information including fre-
quency (56.3%) and number (56.3%) of sessions over a
specified time frame (81.3%) was addressed by most
studies while duration of each treatment (43.8%) was
covered by less than half of the studies.
Adverse Events
Five of the included studies [10,41,45,49,54] reported
that no adverse events occurred during the trial, while
one[50] reported two serious adverse events (i.e., respira-
tory infection, gastrointestinal bleed) that appeared to be
unrelated to the massage therapy treatment. The remain-
ing studies did not report or mention adverse events.

 outcomes at post-treatment. There was insufficient data
to allow for meta-analysis comparing massage therapy
to a sham treatment. Treatment comparators used for
meta-analysis are denoted beside the author names
in the forest plots (see Figures 3A-D for plotted meta-
analysis results). Publication bias was detected in only
the anxiety and fatigue analyses (see Figures 3C–D for
Egger’s test p-values). Although interpretation is chal-
lenging given the small number of studies pooled
(n ¼ 3), publication bias still cannot be completely ruled
out. All studies, regardless of whether their data was
pooled for meta-analysis, were considered for the over-
all evidence synthesis if three or more studies were in a
specific subgroup assessed.
Pain Intensity/Severity
Massage vs. No Treatment
Three studies, involving 167 cancer participants, com-
pared the effect of massage therapy to no treatment for
pain intensity/severity. All three studies were pooled for
the meta-analysis resulting in a standardized mean dif-
ference (SMD) of �0.20 (95% CI, �0.99 to 0.59;
I2¼82.60%)
at
post-treatment
(see
Figure
3A).
Translated into the VAS, the reduction in pain intensity
is �5.075 (95% CI, �24.80 to 14.63). Studies were
quite heterogeneous. Despite all being of acceptable
methodological quality, the study results were inconsis-
tent; one producing a very large effect compared to no
treatment
(SMD ¼ �0.813),
another[44]
producing
a
much smaller effect (SMD¼ �0.182), and a third [56]
producing no effect (SMD ¼ 0.388) at all. Only one re-
ported adverse events, noting none occurred. As such,
massage therapy appears safe; however, more data
is needed to fully understand safety. Given the small
size
and
apparent
heterogeneity
and
inconsistency
across the pooled studies, no recommendation was
made for massage compared to no treatment for reduc-
ing
pain
intensity/severity
for
cancer
patients
(see
Table 4).
Massage vs. Active Comparator(s)
There were 10 studies involving 708 cancer patients
comparing the effect of massage therapy on pain out-
comes to active comparators (i.e., attention, usual care,
standard treatment, a reading group comparator, and
caring presence). Six of these studies (370 total pa-
tients) had sufficient data available to pool for a meta-
analysis resulting in a SMD of �0.55 (95% CI, �1.23 to
0.14; I2¼89.26%) for a reduction of pain intensity/sever-
ity. See Figure 3B. Translated into a VAS, the reduction
in pain intensity is �13.63 (95% CI, �30.78 to 3.5). The
majority of these studies consistently demonstrated
massage therapy, performed by either a massage thera-
pist or trained nurse, was more effective than the active
comparator. Although one outlier [41] showed a reading
group produced a larger effect on cancer pain than
massage therapy, this effect may be due to the different
nature of the massage intervention, which was designed
as an instructional video for caregivers to administer
massage techniques. Despite this outlier, the overall
pooled studies favored massage therapy. All but two of
the 10 studies were of either high or acceptable meth-
odological quality.
Only five studies discussed adverse events, reporting
that no such events occurred. Even though the evi-
dence appears to favor massage therapy for cancer
pain, the EMT Working Group suggested a weak rec-
ommendation in favor of massage compared to active
comparator for reducing cancer pain intensity/severity.
Further research is very likely to alter the estimate of the
effect. Though the majority of studies demonstrated
consistent results, heterogeneity within the pooled stud-
ies is concerning. Further information is needed to care
for this special population; appropriate pressure, dosing,
as well as what types of practitioners with what creden-
tials are best for treating pain in cancer populations
must be well understood before a strong recommenda-
tion can be made (see Table 4).

 Sleep
Massage vs. Active Comparator(s): Fatigue
Six studies, involving 539 cancer patients, assessed
sleep
as
measured
by
fatigue
in
cancer
patients
experiencing pain. Three of these studies (235 total pa-
tients) examining fatigue in cancer pain patients were
pooled for this meta-analysis yielding a SMD of �1.06
(95% CI, �2.18 to 0.05; I2¼92.81%). See Figure 3C.
A large amount of heterogeneity is noted. Massage ther-
apy showed a small positive effect for massage com-
pared to reading [41] or caring presence [54], as well as
a large positive effect when compared to standard treat-
ment [46], which should be interpreted with caution.
Further, massage appears safe with infrequent adverse
events according to the four studies that reported on
safety. Subsequently, a weak recommendation was pro-
vided for massage therapy to reduce fatigue for cancer
patients experiencing pain (see Table 4). Adhering to re-
porting requirements such as the proposed STRICT-M
and developing clear clinical practice guidelines for treat-
ing this special population is essential before making any
further recommendations for cancer pain patients.
Stress, Mood, and Health-Related Quality of Life
Massage vs. Active Comparator(s): Anxiety
Eight studies, involving 620 cancer patients, examined
stress, mood (anxiety), and HrQoL outcomes. The same
three studies (234 total patients) included in the fatigue
meta-analysis were pooled for this meta-analysis result-
ing in a SMD of �1.24 (95% CI, �2.44 to �0.03;
I2¼93.56%). See Figure 3D. There is a large amount of
heterogeneity within these three pooled studies, with
two studies [41,46,54] producing relatively small effects
and third producing a substantial positive effect; the lat-
ter should be interpreted cautiously given its low meth-
odological quality and small sample size. Based on the
four studies that reported on adverse events, massage
appears
safe
with
infrequent
adverse
events.
Consequently, a weak recommendation in favor of mas-
sage therapy was provided for cancer patients dealing
with anxiety; however, until clear guidelines are devel-
oped for practitioners working with cancer patients,
caution is warranted (see Table 4).
Discussion
Based on this systematic review and meta-analysis,
massage therapy was found to be relatively safe, with
infrequent adverse events. Overall, massage therapy
seems to be more effective than other active treatments
evaluated for reducing pain intensity/severity, fatigue,
and anxiety in cancer patients. There was insufficient
evidence available to draw any conclusions surrounding
massage therapy compared to either sham treatment or
no treatment controls. The evidence synthesis could not
be conducted on HrQoL, emotional stress, and activity
outcomes due to an insufficient amount of studies
examining these outcomes. Future research should fo-
cus on evaluating these outcomes to better understand
the total impact massage has on the whole person.
Methodology
Overall, the majority of studies were high or acceptable
quality. Most aspects of internal validity were adequately
addressed; however, many studies failed to either suc-
cessfully carry out or describe allocation concealment pro-
cedures. Sufficient descriptions of similarities between
multiple
sites,
when
applicable,
were
also
lacking.
Similarly, half of the studies [41,42,45–49,51] did not men-
tion blinding. Blinding of patients may not be appropriate
or possible in massage trials; however, blinding of data
collectors and outcome assessors (e.g., single blinding) is
often achievable. Although this review excluded blinding
from its risk of bias assessment, due to these challenges,
the authors tracked whether studies mentioned blinding
procedures, as such processes are a critical component
of clinical trials that should, at the very least, be dis-
cussed;
regardless
of
whether
blinding
is
possible,
authors should always state who was blinded, or, if blind-
ing was not carried out, discuss attempts made toward
blinding or justify their reasoning for excluding such proce-
dures. Moreover, although external validity was detailed
by most studies, model validity was not addressed by
many, making it difficult to understand how the results of
these studies may be replicated and massage therapy
implemented into practice. Subsequently, the authors
encourage future research adhere to CONSORT guide-
lines to avoid such methodological flaws. Following such
guidelines helps ensure that critical study elements are
not only carried out, but also reported on, allowing for
translation and eventual implementation to occur.
Research Challenges
In order to successfully implement massage therapy into
real-world settings, several factors (i.e., specifics of mas-
sage protocols including amount of time spent massag-
ing specific locations as well as details of massage-
related
interventions;
adequate
dosing
and
time
of
administration; practitioner type, qualifications, as well as
licensing requirements for this special population) must
be well-understood to clearly interpret the effect of mas-
sage on cancer patients. Although this information is es-
sential for replication, many studies included in this
systematic review failed to report on these items. For ex-
ample, most studies described the type of practitioner;
however, only a third of studies described the practi-
tioner’s qualifications. Although practitioner characteristics
(e.g., qualifications, affiliation, experience, clinical exper-
tise) can influence massage treatment effects [57] and
are likely associated with an improvement in outcomes
[58], this concept is difficult to explore as this information
is typically underreported [59,60]. Practitioner qualifica-
tions and credentialing are especially important with can-
cer populations as oncology massage typically requires
providers to have special training. In fact, several mas-
sage modifications related to positioning, pressure, pace,

 or location of massage may need to be considered. It
could be that practitioners may need to work around
medical devices and be aware of concerns such as med-
ical devices, side effects from drug or surgical treatments,
and compromised bone integrity, lymph nodes, and
blood cell counts. Similarly, individuals with cancer are of-
ten affected by additional cancer-related conditions that
require substantial adjustments be made to ensure the
patient’s comfort and/or safety [61]. Massage therapists
must know what particulars to elicit from the patient and
respond accordingly. To date, this is not well understood.
Specific intervention details and safety are necessary for
replication and validation of the trial’s results, building a
future research agenda and making decisions regarding
implementation. Researchers and clinicians are unable to
make recommendations to patients based on inconsis-
tent or missing data. As such, the authors encourage re-
searchers
to
utilize
standard
reporting
guidelines
(i.e.,
proposed
STRICT-M
Checklist),
as
well
as
CONSORT Guidelines when developing protocols and re-
porting clinical trials to ensure critical study elements are
carried out and reported. In fact, this review demon-
strated the wide variety in the types, styles, dosages, and
naming conventions of massage that made it difficult to
define “massage.” Adhering to the proposed STRICT-M
would help standardize the language used to describe
massage, thereby enabling readers to better understand
how to conceptualize massage as a therapy.
Future research should also focus on identifying appro-
priate controls in order to best determine the efficacy of
massage. The majority of studies compared massage to
another active therapy and reported massage was
superior to most comparators. Further comparative ef-
fectiveness studies should be conducted to better un-
derstand these comparisons. Additionally, no studies
included in this review performed cost analyses; the au-
thors recommend that future studies conduct cost anal-
yses to determine which intervention is most practical
and appropriate for implementation.
No studies compared massage to sham therapy, and
only a handful of studies compared it to no treatment.
Several challenges surround selecting control groups
suitable for massage therapy. For example, no treat-
ment control groups do not control for nonspecific ef-
fects of attention and touch, resulting in massage
interventions tending to be more successful than such
controls. Wait list controls, moreover, do not control for
placebo effects, and treatment as usual controls often
assign individuals to care that they may have already
previously tried and found unsuccessful. As such, mas-
sage should be assessed against controls that are
equally credible, acceptable, and seemingly identical in
order to ensure positive effects are truly attributable to
massage. Sham controls (e.g., sham massage, light
touch) are promising; however, there is debate whether
touch control is a true placebo, as touch elicits nonspe-
cific psychological effects. Future research should focus
on
identifying
appropriate
control
groups
to
better
understand the efficacy of massage, and whether it is
appropriate to use for this patient population. Further,
patient expectation was only measured by one study
[56] in this review; the authors also encourage future tri-
als to include questions about patient and practitioner
expectation, as expectation can contribute to a placebo
effect.
Not only is it important to identify appropriate compara-
tors in order to ensure impactful results, but utilizing
standardized, valid, and reliable patient-reported out-
comes is also essential to successful healthcare. Using
such outcomes helps decision-makers make evidence-
based decisions for cost-effective treatments that are
meaningful to the patient and focused on whole person
healing.
The
National
Institute
of
Health’s
Patient
Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System
(PROMIS) was designed to develop reliable and valid
patient-reported
items
to
evaluate
patient-reported
symptoms and health outcomes meaningful to patient
function [62]. The Pain Assessment Screening Tool and
Outcomes Registry (PASTOR) [63] is an example of a
clinical pain assessment tool that utilizes PROMIS do-
mains in order to standardize approaches to pain man-
agement. Such assessment tools are not only patient-
centered, but are also less time consuming than using
multiple individual assessment tools. This current review
examined PROMIS and PASTOR domains to pre-define
the function-related outcomes of interest. The authors
encourage researchers to utilize measures that include
PROMIS domains in all future massage therapy clinical
trial work to not only ensure patient-centered care is at
the forefront of research, but to also create both effec-
tive and easy translation and combinability of future re-
sults for the massage field.
In addition, while the authors used a clinically important
cut-off point of 20-mm for the VAS for the reduction in
pain, this should be interpreted with caution. What con-
stitutes a clinically important change will vary for each
individual; the whole-person perspective should be in-
corporated into that change-factor assessing globally
not only pain reduction, but also psychological, physical,
social, spiritual functioning as well. Since massage is
considered complementary, we encourage the field to
evaluate pain using measures beyond pain intensity
when evaluating the success on any therapeutic ap-
proach to pain.
Applicability
Lastly, it is important to note that a recent meta-analysis
was published reporting the effect of massage therapy
on cancer pain [21] while this current review was being
executed. There are important similarities to note. Both
this current review and Lee et al. included similar stud-
ies, with the exception of a few that were not within the
scope of this current review (i.e., controlled clinical trials,
shiatsu or reflexology massage studies). The authors
agree with Lee et al. on the importance of identifying
appropriate control groups to guide future research in
Boyd et al.

 this field, as well as reporting practitioner characteristics
in all future studies to be able to interpret the results for
real-world applicability. The authors believe this current
review adds to this work by not only including a more
recent search, but also examining a variety of outcomes
and controls, rather than the specific outcomes (i.e.,
cancer pain) and controls (i.e., no treatment or conven-
tional care) that Lee et al. investigated. For example, the
current review includes a narrower definition of massage
therapy; unlike the Lee et al. analysis, this review did
not include reflexology or shiatsu, as these therapies did
not meet the review’s definition of massage since these
approaches have their own certification and council of
schools and have fought to be recognized as separate
from “massage.” Further, Lee et al. was more interested
with the population, performing subgroup analyses on
types of cancer and causes of cancer pain. Conversely,
this review focused on function-related outcomes and
HrQoL, taking the stance that pain is multi-dimensional
and must be approached holistically by examining such
outcomes in order to fully understand the impact of
massage for those experiencing pain. Lee et al. also
performed subgroup analyses on types of massage; the
authors avoided such analyses given the heterogeneity
of massage types and inconsistencies in the field re-
garding the definition of massage. As such, the authors
believe that massage, as a whole, first needs to be un-
derstood before examining specific types of massage
and conducting comparative effectiveness research.
Despite these differences in protocols, both meta-analy-
ses demonstrated favorable effects for massage on can-
cer pain, and the two approaches complement each
other. The Lee et al. meta-analysis, however, reported
much larger effects overall. Because results of meta-
analyses can differ greatly depending on the source of
data used for the meta-analysis, these differences could
be due to the aforementioned differences in protocols
(e.g., outcomes and comparators assessed) as well as
some additional differences pertaining to the analytical
techniques and the ways in which these procedures
were carried out. Because of this, results should always
be interpreted with caution, and methodology should al-
ways be explicitly stated in all reports.
Suggested Next Steps for Future Research
1. Encourage
researchers
to
follow
the
CONSORT
Checklist when developing protocols and reporting
trial findings to facilitate a complete and transparent
report of the trial, aiding in their critical appraisal and
interpretation.
2. Consider the proposed STRICT-M Checklist and
adapt it for use in future trials; focus on practitioner
qualifications and credentialing, and the special con-
siderations required for this population.
3. Consider using PROMIS patient-reported outcome
measures in future massage therapy clinical trials.
4. Sort through the issue of heterogeneity in the current
literature base, considering items 1–3, and make rec-
ommendations regarding standard criteria for future
protocol development.
5. Conduct comparative effectiveness research, incor-
porating cost benefit analyses, on the use of mas-
sage therapy in cancer populations.
Conclusion
This is the first systematic review to assess function-
related outcomes and HrQoL in cancer pain populations.
Massage therapy appears to be promising for reducing
pain intensity/severity, fatigue, and anxiety in cancer pop-
ulations compared to the active comparators evaluated in
this systematic review. Patients should consider massage
therapy as a therapeutic option to help manage their
cancer pain. Specific factors surrounding the massage
protocol, as well as selection of appropriate controls and
standard outcomes, need to be well-understood before
definitive clinical conclusions and recommendations re-
garding the usage and implementation of massage can
be made for cancer pain at a policy level. This review’s
promising results warrant investment of time and re-
sources into future research aimed at addressing these
aforementioned gaps in order to ultimately consider mas-
sage therapy a standard treatment for cancer populations
experiencing pain.
