 with diabetes at baseline with those without diabetes for the
risk of death from any cancer and from site-specific cancers,
including cancers of the oesophagus, stomach, colorectum,
colon, rectum, liver, bile duct, pancreas, lung, breast, endome-
trium, cervix, ovary, prostate, bladder, kidney and thyroid, as
well as lymphoma and leukaemia.
Results During a mean follow-up of 12.7 years, 37,343 cancer
deaths (36,667 in East Asians and 676 in South Asians) were
identified. Baseline diabetes status was statistically signifi-
cantly associated with an increased risk of death from any
cancer (HR 1.26; 95% CI 1.21, 1.31). Significant positive
associations with diabetes were observed for cancers of the
colorectum (HR 1.41; 95% CI 1.26, 1.57), liver (HR 2.05;
95% CI 1.77, 2.38), bile duct (HR 1.41; 95% CI 1.04, 1.92),
gallbladder (HR 1.33; 95% CI 1.10, 1.61), pancreas (HR 1.53;
95% CI 1.32, 1.77), breast (HR 1.72; 95% CI 1.34, 2.19),
endometrium (HR 2.73; 95% CI 1.53, 4.85), ovary (HR
1.60; 95% CI 1.06, 2.42), prostate (HR 1.41; 95% CI 1.09,
1.82), kidney (HR 1.84; 95% CI 1.28, 2.64) and thyroid (HR
1.99; 95% CI 1.03, 3.86), as well as lymphoma (HR 1.39;
95% CI 1.04, 1.86). Diabetes was not statistically significantly
associated with the risk of death from leukaemia and cancers
of the bladder, cervix, oesophagus, stomach and lung.
Conclusions/interpretation Diabetes was associated with a
26% increased risk of death from any cancer in Asians. The
pattern of associations with specific cancers suggests the need
for better control (prevention, detection, management) of the
growing epidemic of diabetes (as well as obesity), in order to
reduce cancer mortality.

Introduction
There is emerging evidence of a link between type 2 di-
abetes and an increased risk of developing cancer and
death from cancer. A meta-analysis estimated that diabe-
tes was associated with a 17% and 21% increased risk of
developing any cancer and death from any cancer, respec-
tively [1]. However, most studies of the association be-
tween diabetes and cancer risk have been conducted in
Western populations [2]. Epidemiological studies have
documented consistent increases in the prevalence of dia-
betes across Asia [3, 4]. Some evidence suggests that, at
any given BMI, Asians are more susceptible to insulin
resistance and have a higher prevalence of diabetes in
comparison with whites [5]. The risk of diabetes-related
complications and comorbidities may be different in
Asians and whites. Some evidence also suggests that can-
cer risk associated with diabetes is higher in Asians than
in non-Asians [1]; however, the data are inconclusive.
Given the increasing prevalence of diabetes and diabetes
risk factors in Asian populations [3, 4], it is important to
understand the effect of diabetes on cancer in Asians.
Several prospective studies of diabetes and site-specific
cancer risk have been conducted in individual cohorts in
East Asians. However, the majority of the studies have exam-
ined risk for one or only a few cancer sites [6–10], included a
small number of patients with diabetes [11, 12], or failed to
control for important potential confounding variables such as
BMI or obesity [6–8, 12, 13]. Asia is heterogeneous, with
higher cancer mortality found in East Asian countries such
as China, Japan and South Korea (125–164 per 100,000 in
men and 65–82 per 100,000 in women) than in South Asian
countries such as Bangladesh and India (70–90 per 100,000 in

 men and 60–72 per 100,000 in women) [14]. However, no
prospective cohort studies have investigated the influence of
diabetes on cancer in South Asians. Large prospective studies
on the association between diabetes and cancer at specific
organ sites in Asian populations are therefore needed.
We conducted a pooled analysis to evaluate the association
between baseline diabetes and risk of death from all cancers
and site-specific cancers, in 19 Asian prospective cohorts in
the Asia Cohort Consortium (ACC).
Methods
ACC Details of the ACC, an international collaboration com-
mitted to the study of the aetiology of diseases in Asian pop-
ulations, have been presented elsewhere [15, 16]. Cohorts
were identified through a systematic search of the literature
in early 2008, followed by a survey that was sent to each
cohort to assess data availability [16]. The ACC includes more
than 20 cohorts representing Japan, China, South Korea,
India, Taiwan, Bangladesh and Singapore. Cohort studies that
were included in the present study are listed in Table 1.
Several of these cohorts have examined the association be-
tween diabetes and cancer risk [9, 17, 18]. Our study was
approved by the institutional review board of the Fred
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (Seattle, WA, USA)
and by the ethics committees of each individual cohort study.
Data manipulation Relevant data from each of the participat-
ing cohorts were transferred and harmonised at the ACC
coordinating centre at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
Center. Harmonisation involved several rounds of discussions
to ensure that variables were correctly interpreted and extract-
ed. Data were checked for illogical or missing values, and
queries were sent back for clarification. The distributions of
individual variables were explored to identify false or

 implausible values. All personal identifiers were removed, but
study-specific ID numbers were retained to facilitate referral
of all queries back to the individual cohort.
Diabetes and outcome data The 19 participating cohorts
included a total of 847,009 individuals. Self-reported data on
diabetes at baseline were collected from all cohorts. Available
data on other indicators of diabetes in some of the cohorts
support the overall validity of these self-reported data. For
instance, in the Bangladeshi cohort, glycosuria was measured
in 11,122 (95%) members, and 62% of participants who tested
positive for glycosuria also self-reported as having been diag-
nosed with diabetes by a physician, while 99.1% of those who
tested negative reported no such history [19]. The result is
comparable with that from high-income countries such as
Japan, where the sensitivity and specificity of the question-
naire for diabetic hyperglycaemia were 46% and 98%, respec-
tively [15, 20].
All the participating cohorts were required to have avail-
able baseline data on diabetes status (self-reported), BMI
(measured or self-reported), cigarette-smoking status, age,
sex, follow-up time, vital status and cause of death (ICD-9
[www.icd9data.com/2007/Volume1] or ICD-10 [www.who.
int/classifications/icd/en/]). In the present analysis, we
excluded participants with data missing on age (n = 528),
baseline diabetes (n=73,178) and vital status (n=2775), and
those for whom data on follow-up duration were invalid or
missing (n=2947). After these exclusions, 771,297 partici-
pants remained (391,619 men and 379,678 women).
Information on the types of diabetes (i.e. type 1 or type 2)
was not available; however, given that type 1 diabetes ac-
counts for less than 3% of total diabetes in Asia [21] and that
we included adult cohorts only, we assume the large majority
would have had type 2 diabetes. Additional data were avail-
able from selected cohorts on alcohol drinking (17 cohorts),
education (14 cohorts), urban/rural residence (18 cohorts), du-
ration of diabetes (six cohorts), and diabetes treatment (four
cohorts).
Cancer death was ascertained from the underlying causes
of death recorded on death certificates or death records in East
Asian cohorts and in the Mumbai cohort. A validated verbal
autopsy questionnaire was used in the Bangladesh cohort [22].
Outcomes of interest included: death from any cancer and
cancers of the oesophagus, stomach, colorectum, colon, rec-
tum, liver, bile duct, pancreas, lung, breast, endometrium, cer-
vix, ovary, prostate, bladder, kidney and thyroid, as well as
lymphoma and leukaemia (electronic supplementary material
[ESM] Table 1). Cancers of interest were selected based on
prior literature on the association between diabetes and the
risk of death from cancer [2, 23].
Statistical analyses To examine the relationship between di-
abetes and the risk of death from cancer, we estimated HRs
and 95% CIs based on Cox proportional hazards regression
models that combined studies in a meta-analysis of individual
participant data [24, 25]. The assumption of proportional haz-
ards was examined by testing the cross-product terms between
covariate variables and log function of survival time within
individual cohorts; p values for all the terms were >0.10. In all
analyses, the effect of diabetes on the risk of death from cancer
was taken to be cohort-specific, assuming that the log-HR
associated with diabetes had a fixed-effect component in each
cohort that was common to all cohorts and a cohort-specific
random effect that was normally distributed with mean zero.
Potential confounders included baseline age, sex, cigarette
smoking (never/ever), BMI, alcohol consumption (never/ev-
er), educational attainment (no formal education, primary, sec-
ondary, trade/technical, university degree, postgraduate de-
gree, other) and urban residence. Likelihood-based methods
were used to test for heterogeneity across studies or geograph-
ic regions by comparing models with and without interactions
between cohort or geographic region and baseline diabetes
status. Stratified analyses were conducted by sex. To evaluate
the potential effect of reverse causation, analyses excluded
person-years and deaths with fewer than 3 years of follow-up.
For any cancer and cancers with sufficient number of
deaths among those with diabetes (n > 70) that were also
associated with diabetes status in the main analyses, including
colorectal cancer, liver cancer, gallbladder cancer, pancreatic
cancer and breast cancer, we further performed stratified anal-
yses among East Asians (China, Taiwan, Singapore, South
Korea and Japan) and South Asians (Bangladesh and India);
by baseline age (<60 or ≥60 years, the median among cancer
deaths in the combined East and South Asians); by baseline
smoking status (never/ever); by baseline alcohol consumption
status (never/ever); and by baseline BMI (22.8 kg/m2, the
median among cancer deaths), to evaluate whether the influ-
ence of diabetes was similar in different subgroups. In cohorts
with the available information, sensitivity analyses were also
conducted to: (1) further control for baseline status of hyper-
tension or cardiovascular disease (CVD); (2) further control
for baseline status of cancer; (3) exclude studies that were
initially clinical trials; and (4) exclude prevalent cases of
CVD and cancer at baseline. In a subgroup of six cohorts
(n=243,214) with data on age at first diagnosis of diabetes,
diabetes duration at baseline was calculated as the difference
between age at first diagnosis and age at enrolment. We con-
ducted analyses to estimate HRs, comparing those with differ-
ent diabetes duration (<5 or ≥5 years) with those without
diabetes at baseline. A separate model was also conducted
including only the diabetes cases to compare the risk of death
from cancer by diabetes duration (<5 vs ≥5 years) and to
estimate the p values of the comparisons. Similar analyses
were conducted in a subgroup of four cohorts (n=198,440)
with data on current treatment of diabetes (yes/no). All statis-
tical analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS
Diabetologia (2017) 60:1022–1032
1025
 Institute, Cary, NC, USA) or Stata, version 14.0 (StataCorp
LP, College Station, TX, USA). All tests were two-sided and
p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
After exclusions, the study comprised a total of 771,297 par-
ticipants from 19 cohorts (Table 1), including 658,611 East
Asians and 112,686 South Asians. The participants were, on
average, 53.9 years old at baseline and had a mean follow-up
of 12.7 years. Across all studies, 50.8% were men and 65.3%
of men were ever smokers. The diabetes prevalence was low-
est in the Linxian General Population Trial Cohort Study in
China (0.1%) and highest in the Singapore Chinese Health
Study (9.0%). Overall, diabetes was statistically significantly
associated with a higher risk of death from any cancer and
from cancers of the colorectum, colon and rectum separately,
liver, bile duct, gallbladder, pancreas, breast, endometrium,
ovary, prostate, kidney and thyroid, as well as lymphoma
(Table 2). The association was strongest for cancers of the
liver, endometrium and thyroid. After excluding the first
3 years of follow-up, the associations between diabetes and
the risk of death from any cancer and site-specific cancers
were not materially changed.
The pattern of the associations between diabetes and cancer
mortality in men was similar to that seen overall (Fig. 1). The
risk of death from lymphoma, oesophageal cancer and stom-
ach cancer associated with diabetes was greater in women
than in men. There was evidence of effect modification by
sex for lymphoma (pinteraction < 0.01) and stomach cancer
(pinteraction=0.02). The positive association between diabetes
and any cancer was similar in East and South Asians, although
the estimate in South Asians did not reach statistical signifi-
cance, possibly owing to the small number of deaths in par-
ticipants with diabetes (Fig. 2). Excluding participants with a
history of cancer, hypertension or CVD, and additional adjust-
ment for these conditions did not change the strength of the

 association appreciably. A greater risk of death from any can-
cer was associated with diabetes among individuals who were
<60 years at baseline than among individuals ≥60 years
(pinteraction<0.01). For colorectal cancer, the HRs were similar
across all subgroups (Fig. 2). Similarly, a stronger association
between diabetes and the risk of death from liver cancer and
gallbladder cancer was observed in individuals <60 years
compared with those ≥60 years (pinteraction<0.01). For pancre-
atic cancer, the risk of death associated with diabetes was
stronger in individuals <60 years and in those with a BMI
<22.8 kg/m2 compared with the HRs observed in the respec-
tive counterparts; the interaction of diabetes with age and BMI
was statistically significant (pinteraction=0.02 and 0.03, respec-
tively). The positive association between diabetes and death
from breast cancer remained robust with additional control for
the influence of baseline cancer, hypertension or CVD, and
among never smokers and never drinkers. The association was
stronger in those with a lower BMI compared with those with
a higher BMI, although the interaction was not statistically
significant.
We further explored the relationship of duration and treat-
ment of diabetes with the risk of death from cancer in cohorts
with available data. Analyses were done for cancers with ten
or more deaths among diabetic participants. With the excep-
tion of breast cancer, among diabetic participants the associa-
tions between diabetes of ≥5 years’ duration at baseline and
the risk of death from any cancer and colorectal cancer, liver
cancer or pancreatic cancer were weaker than those related to
diabetes of <5 years’ duration; however, none of the differ-
ences in estimates was statistically significant (ESM Table 2).
In cohorts with data on current treatment, participants current-
ly treated for diabetes, compared with those not currently
treated, tended to have a greater risk of death from any cancer
and cancers of the liver, gallbladder and pancreas; however,
the risk difference reached statistical significance for death
from any cancer only (p=0.03; ESM Table 3). Results from
sensitivity analyses excluding studies that were initially clin-
ical trials (Linxian General Population Trial Cohort Study)
were essentially the same (data not shown).
Discussion
In this pooled analysis of 19 Asian cohorts including more
than 771,000 participants followed for up to 21 years, diabetes
was associated with a 26% increase in the risk of death from
any cancer. Specifically, diabetes was related to an increased
risk of death from colorectal cancer, liver cancer, bile duct
cancer, gallbladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer,
endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, kidney
cancer, thyroid cancer and lymphoma. The positive associa-
tions for any cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, gallblad-
der cancer, pancreatic cancer and breast cancer remained
across different strata of BMI, smoking status and alcohol

 drinking status. Consistently stronger associations were seen in
individuals <60 years at enrolment than in their older counter-
parts for liver cancer, gallbladder cancer and pancreatic cancer.
Several studies have addressed the association of diabetes
with the risk of death from any cancer. A pooled analysis of 97
prospective cohorts in 820,900 whites from the Emerging Risk
Factors Collaboration (ERFC) reported an HR of 1.25 (95% CI
1.19, 1.31) for death from any cancer in people with diabetes
compared with those without diabetes [26]. In a prospective
cohort of one million US adults in Cancer Prevention Study II
(CPS II), diabetes was associated with increases in the risk of
death from any cancer of 7% and 11% in men and women,
respectively [27]. A meta-analysis reported a summary relative
risk of death from any cancer associated with diabetes of 1.32
(95% CI 1.20, 1.45) based on three studies in Asians, and 1.16
(95% CI 1.01, 1.34) based on 14 studies in non-Asians [1]. In the
present pooled analysis of Asians, we report an HR of 1.26 (95%
CI 1.21, 1.31) for death from any cancer associated with diabetes.
In CPS II, diabetes was positively related to death from cancers
of the colon, liver or intrahepatic bile duct, pancreas, breast,
endometrium, prostate (reduced risk) and bladder (in men only)
[27]. The ERFC study reported that diabetes was moderately
associated with death from cancers of the colorectum, liver,
pancreas, breast, ovary, lung and bladder [26]. Our observed
cancer-specific associations are largely consistent with these re-
ports from two large studies in cohorts from Western countries on
digestive cancers (including cancers of the colorectum, liver, bile
duct, gallbladder and pancreas), as well as breast cancer. These
data together suggest that the influence of diabetes on the risk of
death from overall cancer, digestive cancers and breast cancer is
largely similar in Asians and in developed Western countries.
The moderate associations between diabetes and the risk of
death from liver and pancreatic cancer observed in our analy-
ses are consistent with previous studies [2, 28]. A recent meta-
analysis of 25 prospective studies of Asians and whites report-
ed a twofold higher risk of liver cancer associated with diabe-
tes, after controlling for alcohol intake, cirrhosis and viral
hepatitis B or C infection [29]. However, reverse causation
has been suspected, as mechanistic studies found that pancre-
atic cancer causes paraneoplastic beta cell dysfunction by
shedding exosomes containing adrenomedullin and CA19-
9 into circulation that inhibit insulin secretion [30]. In our
subgroup analyses, although we observed that diabetes of short
duration was more strongly related to the risk of cancer com-
pared with diabetes of long duration, the difference was not
statistically significant and the risk associated with diabetes of
long duration remained elevated. A recent meta-analysis of 36
cohort studies reported that summary relative risks of pancreatic
cancer remained elevated when excluding diabetes of short
duration [31], suggesting that reverse causation does not account
for all the association. The higher risk of liver cancer and
pancreatic cancer in diabetes could potentially be related to
exposure of these organs to particularly elevated insulin in
people with diabetes, particularly if the tumour cells remain
sensitive to insulin [23, 32]. In the present study, a stronger
association seen in younger participants for liver, gallbladder
and pancreatic cancer also supports metabolic dysfunction
(more predominant in the early years of diabetes because of
insulin resistance [33]) as being involved in the association be-
tween diabetes and these cancers. Taken together, given the
magnitude of the associations and the consistent data across
studies and different populations, diabetes control should be
considered in cancer prevention for these cancers in Asians,
especially for liver cancer, which has a high incidence in Asians.
Available data on the association between diabetes and
colorectal cancer mortality are limited but are generally con-
sistent with our findings [26, 34]. In addition to
hyperinsulinaemia, hypothesised mechanisms include the
slower bowel transit time and the elevated faecal bile acid
concentrations related to diabetes [32]. We also found that
diabetes was related to a 30–40% increased risk of death from
gallbladder cancer and bile duct cancer, consistent with previ-
ous meta-analyses in whites and Asians [35, 36]. Aside from
hyperinsulinaemia and resultant high levels of insulin-like
growth factors, possible explanations for the increased risk
include the propensity of diabetic individuals to develop gall-
stones [37], and increased production of biliary cholesterol
and lithogenic bile salts as a result of insulin resistance, which
also directly promotes the formation of gallstones [38].
We observed positive associations of diabetes with the risk
of death from breast cancer, endometrial cancer, ovarian can-
cer, prostate cancer, kidney cancer, thyroid cancer and lym-
phoma. Hormone-related mechanisms, such as increases in
bioavailable oestrogen, stimulation of endometrial stromal
cells, increases in androgen synthesis and increases in endog-
enous sex steroids [23] due to increased circulating insulin,
may underlie the associations for breast and other female can-
cers. Cumulative epidemiological evidence suggests an asso-
ciation between diabetes and breast cancer [34]. Genetic fac-
tors have emerged that potentially contribute to the associa-
tions with some female cancers [39, 40]. Data on ovarian
cancer are less well established, possibly due to small sample
sizes in existing studies, including the present analysis.
Further large studies are needed to confirm and investigate
effect modifiers for the influence of diabetes on less common
hormone-related female cancers such as ovarian cancer in
Asians.
Consistent with other prospective studies of cancer mortal-
ity in both whites [27, 41] and Asians [42], we did not observe
an association between diabetes and the risk of lung cancer
mortality. The association with mortality from oesophageal
cancer and stomach cancer in whites and Asians has been
generally null [26, 27, 42], except for a South Korean study,
which found a positive association between diabetes and the
risk of death from both cancers in men [28]. By contrast, we
observed an increased risk of death from these two cancers
Diabetologia (2017) 60:1022–1032

 that was confined to women. The lack of consistency may be
caused by the heterogeneous nature of these cancers (each has
subtypes with different aetiologies). Future studies are needed
to investigate associations by subtypes of cancer and to ex-
plore whether other sex-specific risk differences, such as in the
pattern and extent of alcohol drinking, can explain the differ-
ence by sex. Evidence of the association between diabetes and
kidney cancer, thyroid cancer and lymphoma has also been
inconsistent, although meta-analyses have suggested positive
associations between diabetes and these cancers [43–45]. Two
cohort studies in Asians reported a statistically significant in-
crease in the risk of thyroid cancer incidence or mortality
among diabetic patients [10, 13]. We observed moderate as-
sociations for kidney (HR 1.84; 95% CI 1.28, 2.64) and thy-
roid (HR 1.99; 95% CI 1.03, 3.86) cancer in Asians, suggest-
ing that the effects of diabetes on these cancers may be greater
than those observed in whites. However, future larger studies
that include information on subtypes of these cancers are
needed to confirm the associations in Asians.
For prostate cancer, most of the studies that found an in-
verse association were conducted in whites [27, 46]. Studies in
Asians generated inconsistent findings, and a meta-analysis of
studies in Asians concluded that there was a positive associa-
tion [47]. The influence of diabetes on prostate cancer in
Asians and whites appears different, possibly due to differ-
ences in incidence rates, screening, diagnosis and treatment
in the two populations. In addition, because the outcomes in
this study are based on mortality data, they reflect the com-
bined influence of diabetes on disease incidence and survival.
Additional studies with incidence data in Asians are warrant-
ed, as such data are critical for prostate cancer, for which there
is a greater difference between cancer incidence and cancer
mortality, compared with other cancers such as liver and pan-
creatic cancers, which have a shorter survival time.
Major strengths of the present study included a large sam-
ple size of diverse Asian populations, allowing us to conduct
several sensitivity analyses and stratified analyses by sex, age,
smoking status and alcohol consumption. In addition, we had
detailed data at the individual level from all cohorts for covar-
iate adjustments and exploration of heterogeneity, avoiding
some drawbacks of meta-analysis based on aggregate data
from published results. In addition, we included a comprehen-
sive list of causes of cancer death. A limitation of our study is
the use of self-reported diabetes status and the lack of update
on diabetes status during follow-up. This might have resulted
in non-differential misclassification. In a subgroup analysis,
we found that the association between treated diabetes and
cancer was stronger than that between untreated diabetes and
cancer, suggesting that the use of a more stringent definition of
diabetes may reduce this misclassification. The use of self-
reported information prevented us from distinguishing
between type 1 and type 2 diabetes; however, type 2 diabetes
accounts for more than 90% of diabetes [16, 48]. Certain
diabetes treatments have been reported to increase(e.g. exog-
enous insulin) or decrease(e.g. metformin) the risk of cancer
[23, 49, 50], but our pooled analyses cannot address the influ-
ence of specific treatments, due to the lack of data. We had
data on the absence and presence of current treatment only in a
small subset of cohorts. Finally, we have limited sample sizes
to evaluate the influence of diabetes on site-specific cancers in
South Asians. Given that South Asian populations are under-
going an epidemiological transition, there is an emerging need
for cohort studies to be conducted for cancer risk factors.
Conclusion We observed that diabetes was related to an in-
creased risk of death from any cancer, colorectal cancer, liver
cancer, bile duct cancer, gallbladder cancer, pancreatic cancer,
breast cancer, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate
cancer, kidney cancer, thyroid cancer and lymphoma in
Asians. The findings indicate a potential need for appropriate
cancer screening among individuals with diabetes and a great-
er emphasis on lifestyle modifications related to cancer mor-
tality not only in Western populations but also in Asians. We
also found an increased risk associated with diabetes from
other cancers, which requires future confirmation.
