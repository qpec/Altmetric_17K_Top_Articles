Abstract
Consumer demand for milk and meat from grass- 
fed cattle is growing, driven mostly 
by perceived health benefits and concerns about animal welfare. In a U. S.- 
wide study 
of 1,163 milk samples collected over 3 years, we quantified the fatty acid profile in 
milk from cows fed a nearly 100% forage- 
based diet (grassmilk) and compared it to 
profiles from a similar nationwide study of milk from cows under conventional and 
organic management. We also explored how much the observed differences might 
help reverse the large changes in fatty acid intakes that have occurred in the United 
States over the last century. Key features of the fatty acid profile of milk fat include 
its omega- 
6/omega- 
3 ratio (lower is desirable), and amounts of total omega- 
3, conju-
gated linoleic acid, and long- 
chain omega- 
3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. For each, we 
find that grassmilk is markedly different than both organic and conventional milk. The 
omega- 
6/omega- 
3 ratios were, respectively, 0.95, 2.28, and 5.77 in grassmilk, or-
ganic, and conventional milk; total omega- 
3 levels were 0.049, 0.032, and 
0.020 g/100 g milk; total conjugated linoleic acid levels were 0.043, 0.023, and 
0.019 g/100 g milk; and eicosapentaenoic acid levels were 0.0036, 0.0033, and 
0.0025 g/100 g milk. Because of often high per- 
capita dairy consumption relative to 
most other sources of omega- 
3 fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acid, these differ-
ences in grassmilk can help restore a historical balance of fatty acids and potentially 
reduce the risk of cardiovascular and other metabolic diseases. Although oily fish 
have superior concentrations of long- 
chain omega- 
3 fatty acids, most fish have low 
levels of α- 
linolenic acid (the major omega- 
3), and an omega- 
6/omega- 
3 ratio near 7. 
Moreover, fish is not consumed regularly, or at all, by ~70% of the U. S. population.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Nearly half of Americans suffer from one or more diet- 
driven chronic 
conditions including cardiovascular disease (CVD), overweight and 
obesity, and diabetes (DHHS, 2015; Massiera et al., 2010; FDA, 
2015; ARS, 2010). Seven of the 10 leading causes of death in the 
United States were diet- 
related in 2013 (IHME, 2016a), and none are 
curable via medical intervention alone, despite health care spending 
in the United States that is the highest per capita in the world (IHME, 
2016b). These sober facts are among the reasons why there is grow-
ing interest in the United States among scientists and consumers in 
altering diets to prevent or slow the progression of metabolic, car-
diovascular, and other chronic diseases.
Potential diet alterations include reducing intakes of omega- 
6 (ω- 
6) fatty acids (FAs) and increasing intakes of omega- 
3 (ω- 
3) FAs, thus 
decreasing dietary ω- 
6/ω- 
3 ratios. These ratios have become histori-
cally high in Western diets during the last century, reaching about 15, 
compared to estimated evolutionary ratios near 1 (Hibbeln, Nieminen, 
Blasbalg, Riggs, & Lands, 2006; Simopoulos, 2006). These large 
changes are due to both increased intakes of ω- 
6 FAs and decreased 
intakes of ω- 
3 FAs. Modern grain feeding of farm animals has contrib-
uted to these ω- 
6 increases and ω- 
3 decreases in Western diets.
The more natural FA profile of organic and grass- 
fed meat and 
milk has received much attention in recent years (Średnicka- 
Tober 
et al., 2016a,b). The FA profile in modern meat and milk can be sub-
stantially changed by shifting animals from grain- 
 or concentrate- 
rich rations to diets largely based on grass and legume forages 
(Butler et al., 2011; Daley, Abbott, Doyle, Nader, & Larson, 2010; O’ 
Callaghan et al., 2016; Schwendel et al., 2015; Stergiadis et al., 2012). 
This shift increases ω- 
3 FAs and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and 
decreases ω- 
6 FAs in meat and milk, changes that may help prevent 
CVD and other chronic conditions (Leikin-Frenkel, 2016; Hibbeln 
et al., 2006; Simopoulos, 2006). The magnitude of these changes is 
markedly greater than most of the nutritional differences between 
organically and conventionally grown plant- 
based foods (Benbrook, 
Butler, Latif, Leifert, & Davis, 2013; Baranski et al., 2014; Średnicka- 
Tober et al., 2016a,b).
There is rising demand for beef and dairy products from grass- 
fed 
cattle. In 2016, natural- 
food retail leader Whole Foods Market iden-
tified grass- 
fed meat and dairy as a top trend, based on consumer 
interest and rapid sales growth (PR Newswire, 2016; Whole Foods 
Market Blog, 2015). Three- 
quarters of self- 
identified natural- 
food 
and organic consumers purchase grass- 
fed beef and dairy (Market 
Lohas, 2016). Similar interests in human health and animal welfare 
led in 2015 to the marketing in Italy, and later Mexico, of “Latte 
Nobile” (Noble Milk), produced by cows fed primarily grass and hay 
(Renna et al., 2015; Lombardi et al., 2014; Associazione Latte Nobile 
Italiano (http://www.lattenobile.it/).
1.1 | Launch of grassmilk brand
The Wisconsin- 
based cooperative CROPP is the leading U.S. supplier 
of organic milk. In 2011, CROPP launched a new, whole milk, organic 
product called Grassmilk.TM This milk comes from cows fed a nearly 
100% forage- 
based diet. The only exception is certain mineral and en-
ergy supplements, such as molasses. In this paper, the term “grassmilk” 
refers to CROPP’s product, and “grass milk” refers to other brands of 
milk from cows fed a nearly 100% forage- 
based ration.
Besides prohibiting grain in cow rations, CROPP sets grassmilk 
standards for pasture access, supplemental feeds, and animal care 
(see Appendix for details). Farmers in the grassmilk program re-
ceive a price premium of ~15% compared to the organic milk price. 
CROPP closely monitors the FA content of raw grassmilk, to assure 
compliance with its minimum requirements of (1) 39 to 41 mg total 
ω- 
3 FA/100 g of milk, depending on geographical region, (2) 26.6 to 
32.8 mg total CLA/100 g of milk, and (3) an ω- 
6/ω- 
3 ratio ≤ 1.2.
The number of farms shipping grassmilk to CROPP proces-
sors has grown from five California producers in 2011 to 140 
farms throughout the United States at the end of 2016. These 140 
farms represented about 9% of CROPP’s 1,618 dairy- 
farm mem-
bers (CROPP, 2016). Milk, yogurt, and cheese made from grassmilk 
are marketed under CROPP’s Organic Valley brand. In addition to 
meeting USDA’s organic grazing standard (Rinehart & Baier, 2011), 
CROPP’s grassmilk suppliers may not feed grain or silage from grain 
crops harvested from fields that have reached the “boot” stage of 
development (when seed heads form and start to fill out). Nongrain 
supplements including molasses, alfalfa pellets, sugar beets (chipped 
or whole), mineral supplements, and kelp are allowed to meet the 
energy needs of lactating cows and support animal health.
Some supplemental feed is often needed to sustain cow health 
during months of peak production, or when high- 
quality, forage 
feeds are not available in sufficient quantity. Despite reliance on 
some supplemental feeds, forage- 
based feeds make up the vast ma-
jority of annual Dry Matter Intake (DMI) on grassmilk farms.
Farmers in the grassmilk program are also required to document 
that lactating cows consume over 60% of DMI from pasture during 
the grazing season (compared to 30% under the USDA organic 
standard), with a grazing season of at least 150 days (compared to 
120 days under federal organic rules). The length of the grazing sea-
son can be reduced in cases of extreme drought or other weather 
events or natural disasters, or by the tolerance of soils to animal 
traffic.
The nongrazing portion of rations on grassmilk farms must come 
from conserved, organic, forage- 
based feeds, including dried or 
fermented forages (alfalfa, clover, grass hay, etc.). Cereal crops har-
vested prior to their boot stage, such as barley, oats, and BMR corn 
(“brown mid- 
rib” phenotypes developed for early silage harvest), 
can also be fed, as the FA profile of such immature grain crops is 
similar to widely grown grass species in cow pastures (see “Results 
and Discussion” for more detail). Harvested feedstuffs are typically 
preserved by fermentation on- 
farm to produce baleage or silage, or 
stored as dry hay.
The mentioned Noble Milk protocol requires at least 150 days 
per year of grazing and 70% DMI from pasture and hay throughout 
the year, with up to 30% DMI from grains and concentrates allowed. 
Silages, supplements, and genetically modified feeds are prohibited.

BENBROOK Et al.
The milk fat must contain at least 0.25% of total CLA and 0.5% of 
total ω- 
3 FAs, and the LA/ALA ratio must be lower than 4 year round 
(Renna et al., 2015). Pastures must be diverse, with at least four 
major plant species, and the quality of hay is monitored with a sen-
sory analysis (Rubino, 2014).
Benbrook et al. (2013) reported substantial improvements in the 
FA composition of Organic Valley whole, organic milk, compared to 
whole milk from conventionally managed cows. Based on 12- 
month 
averages, they found higher levels of ω- 
3 FAs α- 
linolenic acid (ALA) 
and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) of, respectively, +60% and +33%. 
There was also 18% more total CLA, and less of the ω- 
6 FAs linoleic 
acid (LA) and arachidonic acid (AA) (25% and 17%, respectively), re-
sulting in a 60% lower ω- 
6/ω- 
3 ratio (5.77 down to 2.28).
As estimated below, most organic milk analyzed in Benbrook 
et al. (2013) came from cows receiving ~20% of their yearly DMI 
from grain- 
based feeds. On an annual basis, the USDA organic stan-
dard technically allows up to ~90% DMI from sources other than 
grazing (as only 30% of DMI must come from grazing during a mini-
mum of 120 days per year), although on most organic dairies in the 
United States, forage- 
based feeds play a much greater role than is 
minimally required (CROPP, 2016; Rinehart & Baier, 2011).
Here, we report the added impacts on nutritionally important FA 
levels when lactating cows are fed a nearly 100% forage- 
based diet 
year round, and we model the impact of these changes on typical 
U.S. diets. We also compare the impacts of grassmilk dairy products 
and fish on FA intakes.
2 | METHODS
Milk FA analyses reported in this study come from CROPP’s quality- 
control testing of its grassmilk. Bulk- 
tank, raw milk samples from each 
participating farm (140 in 2016) were collected at least bimonthly in 
sterile plastic bottles, packed with ice- 
packs, and shipped overnight 
to Silliker, Inc., an ISO/IEC 17025 accredited laboratory in Crete, 
Illinois. It used AOAC method 996.06, as revised in 2001 (AOAC 
International, 2012), with modified internal standard (C13:0) and 
temperature program [initial T = 100° (no hold), ramp 2°/min to 214° 
(hold 10 min), ramp 3°/min to 240° (hold 16 min)]. The laboratory 
used capillary column Supelco SP- 
2560, 100 m × 0.25 mm, 0.2 μm 
film. In units of g/100 g of milk, the laboratory did not quantify indi-
vidual FA amounts <0.001, but it did quantify those small amounts 
(if detected) in units of % of total FA, to give the best measure of 
total FA. This laboratory and its methods and reports are identical 
to those used in Benbrook et al. (2013). However, in this paper, we 
report amounts of additional, minor FA that were not reported in the 
2013 paper, due to the relatively small number of samples in 2013.
The detected and summed isomers of reported total CLA include 
cis- 
9, trans- 
11 (commonly 75–90% of the total); trans- 
9, trans- 
11; 
cis- 
9, cis- 
11; trans- 
10, cis- 
12; and cis- 
11, trans- 
13 18:2. The reported 
trans- 
18:1 includes mainly trans- 
11 18:1, vaccenic acid.
This study includes FA analyses of 1,163 raw milk samples col-
lected monthly or bimonthly during three full years, 2014–2016. They 
come primarily from three regions of the United States—Midwest, 
Northeast, and California. A small group of samples came from the 
Middle- 
Eastern United States beginning in June 2016. For compari-
son with raw grassmilk, we also report FA results from 69 samples of 
processed, whole grassmilk, taken from pasteurized, retail contain-
ers (not homogenized). These samples were taken in a systematic 
manner similar in location and season to the raw milk samples. In 
2014, there were 22 samples—12 from the Midwest and 10 from 
California; in 2015, there were 23 samples—five from the Midwest, 
six from California, and 12 from the Northeast; and in 2016, there 
were 24 samples—six from the Midwest, six from California, and 12 
from the Northeast.
As in the 2013 study (Benbrook et al., 2013), we report averages 
of three ω- 
6/ω- 
3 ratios: LA/ALA, ω- 
6/ω- 
3, and ω- 
3/ω- 
6, where ω- 
6 
includes seven FAs (18:2 LA + 18:3 γ- 
linolenic (GLA) + 20:2 eicosa-
dienoic + 20:3 8,11,14- 
eicosatrienoic + 20:4 arachidonic (AA) + 22:2 
docosadienoic + 22:4 docosatetraenoic), and ω- 
3 includes 7 FAs (18:3 
ALA + 18:4 stearidonic/moroctic + 20:3 11,14,17- 
eicosatrienoic + 
20:5 EPA + 22:3 docosatrienoic + 22:5 DPA + 22:6 DHA). We include 
the average ratio, ω- 
3/ω- 
6, for comparison with other papers that 
report this inverted ratio.
2.1 | Statistical analysis
Digital laboratory results were transferred to an Excel spreadsheet 
and spot- 
verified against printed laboratory reports. (The raw data 
are available from MAL or DRD.) The reported FA concentrations 
(g/100 g of milk) in 1,163 raw milk samples were inspected for outli-
ers by normal probability and box plots, and five severe, high outliers 
were excluded, mostly by consensus among DRD, MB, BH, and CMB 
(18:3 γ- 
linolenic = 0.028, trans- 
18:3 = 0.075, 20:1 = 0.070, 11,14,17–
20:3 = 0.040, and 22:6 DHA = 0.025, all in g/100 g of milk). We also 
removed the corresponding values expressed as a percent of total 
FAs. An additional four outliers were found and removed only in the 
values expressed as a percent of total FA: sum of FA = 102.998% 
(high), sum of saturated FA = 87.690% (high), 18:1 = 0.330% (low), 
and sum of cis- 
monounsaturated = 4.89% (low). The removed values 
represent in each case only 1 in 1,163 samples (<0.1%). No outliers 
were found in the 69 samples of retail grassmilk.
Means, counts, standard deviations (SDs), coefficients of vari-
ation (CVs), and standard errors (SEs) were calculated in Microsoft 
Excel. We report SDs, CVs, and SEs with 1 or 2 significant digits. 
Because the statistical uncertainty of a mean is measured by its SE, 
we report means to the same number of decimal places as the SEs. 
With sample counts as high as 1,163, SEs and the statistical uncer-
tainty of means can be much smaller than the laboratory precision 
for individual measurements.
Analyses of annual, monthly, and regional variation in FA concen-
trations used PROC MIXED of SAS (SAS Institute, 2014). The fixed 
effects were year of study, region of the United States (California, 
Midwest, Mideast, and Northeast), and month of sampling, with farm 
as a random effect for repeated measures. The compound symme-
try covariance structure was used, because it resulted in the lowest 
 684  |    
BENBROOK Et al.
Akaike information criterion for repeated measures (Littell, Henry, 
& Ammerman, 1998). We relied on the Satterthwaite correction to 
adjust the degrees of freedom for unequal variances. All treatment 
results are reported as least squares means separated by the Tukey 
procedure with significance declared at p < .05.
2.2 | Diet scenarios and LA/ALA ratios
We modeled hypothetical diet scenarios based on those in Benbrook 
et al. (2013) to test the potential effects of switching whole- 
fat dairy 
products made from conventional milk, to organic milk, and, finally in 
this study, to grassmilk. For these diets, we calculated overall dietary 
intakes of LA and ALA, and the LA/ALA ratio, the major determi-
nant of the ω- 
6/ω- 
3 ratio. We could not calculate the ω- 
6/ω- 
3 ratio 
itself, because there is insufficient data on total ω- 
6 and ω- 
3 FAs 
in most of the foods in our scenarios. However, the ω- 
6/ω- 
3 ratio 
closely tracks the LA/ALA ratio, and both ratios are historically high 
in most Western diets, due to increased ω- 
6 intakes and decreased 
ω- 
3 intakes (Hibbeln et al., 2006; Simopoulos, 2006).
Here, we use the same model diets and assumptions as in the 
previous report (Table 1 in Benbrook et al., 2013), and add new diet 
scenarios using dairy products with the FA profile of grassmilk. As 
in Benbrook et al. (2013), we use full- 
fat dairy products (except for 
yogurt), to quantify the maximum, realistically attainable shift in FA 
intakes from a switch to grass- 
milk- 
based dairy products. For yo-
gurt, we use the highest- 
fat form generally consumed in the United 
States, sweetened “low- 
fat” yogurt with fruit, containing 1.41 g fat 
per 100 g. Sweetened whole- 
fat yogurt is not usually available.
We modeled diets for a moderately active woman, age 19–30, 
consuming 2,100 kcal/day. In three main scenarios, 20%, 33%, or 
45% of that energy came from fat. Within those scenarios, we con-
structed diets that contain either moderate amounts of dairy prod-
ucts (three daily servings, as recommended in the Dietary Guidelines 
for Americans (DHHS, 2015), or 50% higher amounts (4.5 servings/
day). Whole milk, Cheddar cheese, low- 
fat yogurt, and ice cream 
as a “dairy dessert” were the dairy products included (Table 1 in 
Benbrook et al., 2013).
For the LA and ALA contents of dairy fat, the previous study 
used its measured 12- 
month average concentrations in conventional 
and organic milks (Benbrook et al., 2013). For the LA and ALA in 
nondairy foods, the authors used USDA’s standard reference data 
for 8 common foods to represent “typical- 
LA nondairy sources” 
(USDA, 2015). Those foods averaged 23.23 g LA and 1.841 g ALA 
per 100 kcal of fat, for an LA/ALA ratio of 12.6. To illustrate the 
effects of reducing LA intake, they substituted three of the eight 
foods with similar, low- 
LA foods and ingredients (e.g., canola oil in-
stead of soy oil, the major oil used in many foods). These revised 
eight “low- 
LA nondairy sources” averaged 13.84 g LA and 2.731 g 
ALA per 100 kcal of fat, with an LA/ALA ratio of 5.07.
With these assumptions, the 2013 authors calculated the LA/
ALA ratios for 12 diets with typical- 
LA nondairy sources (3 fat levels 
× 2 levels of dairy consumption × 2 types of dairy fat) and for an 
additional 12 diets with low- 
LA nondairy sources. Here, we add to 
these calculations a 3rd type of dairy fat with the average FA profile 
found here in 1,163 grassmilk samples.
3 | RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We set out to answer two key questions. First, to what extent does 
shifting lactating dairy cattle to nearly 100% forage- 
based feeds 
alter the FA profile of their milk compared to currently available 
conventional and organic milks in the United States? The following 
subsection presents results from 3 years of nationwide sampling, in-
cluding seasonal and regional variations.
Our second core question is how much can improvements in the 
FA profile of grassmilk help reverse historically high dietary ω- 
6/ω- 
3 
ratios? We address this question with nutrition modeling results in 
the third subsection below.
3.1 | Altering the fatty acid profile of milk
Table 1 shows concentrations of 37 main FAs (quantified amounts 
>0.001 g/100 g milk) in raw, whole grassmilk, averaged over 3 years 
(2014–2016), reported as g/100 g of milk and as a percentage of 
total FAs. For each FA, there are 1,163 values, less the nonquanti-
fied samples and any outliers removed (as explained in Methods). 
See Table 1 footnotes a and b for details. The coefficients of variation 
(CV = SD/mean) are a measure of variability among samples.
Table S1 shows the same information for 14 minor FAs in grass-
milk. Table 2 shows the same information as Table 1 for 69 retail 
samples of grassmilk taken during 2014–2016. The FA profiles of 
these samples of processed, whole- 
fat grassmilk were measured 
to determine whether there were any significant changes in the 
FA profile of grassmilk as a result of processing and pasteurization. 
For FA concentrations expressed as a percentage of total FAs, the 
amounts in Tables 1 and 2 are very similar, as expected: The means 
in Table 2 average 101 ± SD 5% of the means in Table 1 (for 33 FAs 
with n > 50% of the analyzed samples). However, for FA concentra-
tions expressed in g/100 g milk, the means in Table 2 average only 
75 ± SD 4% of the means in Table 1 (for 38 FAs with n > 50% of the 
analyzed samples). These values are <100%, mainly because fat is 
removed from raw milk to produce retail whole milk with a standard-
ized 3.25% fat content.
Table 3 compares selected FA levels and ratios in organic grass-
milk to those in retail conventional milk and organic milk from 
Benbrook et al., 2013. We incorporated in Table 3 results from the 
1,163 samples of raw grassmilk (Table 1) rather than the results from 
69 samples of processed grassmilk (Table 2). We did so because the 
1,163 samples of grassmilk provide a more accurate, year- 
round FA 
profile of grassmilk than the 69 retail samples. The retail conven-
tional and organic milk samples average ~3.1% total FAs, whereas 
the raw, grassmilk samples average ~3.6% FAs. During the process-
ing of raw grassmilk, ~0.5% of fat is removed to meet the standard 
of identity for fat in whole milk. Accordingly, in Table 3, we adjusted 
the raw grassmilk FA amounts to equal the average total FA content

in the retail conventional and organic milks. The last two pairs of 
columns show the often- 
large percentage differences between con-
ventional and adjusted grassmilk, and between organic and adjusted 
grassmilk.
The p- 
values in Table 3 are from two- 
tailed t tests. These are ac-
curate for individual pairwise comparisons within each of the two 
pairs of columns considered alone, but they somewhat overstate 
the statistical significance of differences between pairs of columns, 
and they do not account for multiple comparisons within columns. 
However, these caveats are minor in view of the usually extremely 
small p- 
values by t test. anova methods are questionable due to the 
unbalanced data and several years between measurements. Total 
saturated and monounsaturated FA levels in the adjusted grassmilk 
show only small percentage differences with those in the conven-
tional and organic milks. But large percentage differences occur in 
the amounts of total ω- 
3 and ω- 
6 FAs, and total CLA. The mean level 
of total ω- 
3 in the adjusted grassmilk samples is more than twice 
that in the conventional samples (up 147%). The shift from organic 
management to nearly 100% forage- 
based diets on grassmilk farms 
increases the level of total ω- 
3 FAs by 52%. In the case of total ω- 
6 
FAs, the level drops 52% in adjusted grassmilk samples compared 
to conventional samples and drops 36% from organic to adjusted 
grassmilk.
The increase in ω- 
3 FAs from conventional to adjusted grassmilk, 
coupled with the decreases in ω- 
6 FAs, reduces the ω- 
6/ω- 
3 ratio 
from 5.8 in conventional milk to 2.3 in organic milk and 0.95 in ad-
justed grassmilk. Comparable changes occur in the LA/ALA ratio.
Significantly, lactating cows fed a nearly 100% grass- and 
legume- 
based diet produce milk with substantially elevated lev-
els of two long- 
chain ω- 
3 FAs. Compared to conventional milk,

aFor FAs reported in units of g/100 g milk, means and the other statistics are based on quantified amounts ≥ 0.001 g/100 g (samples < 0.001 g/100 g 
not included). Hence, for minor FAs with n substantially <1,163, means are elevated, and other statistics are based on the distribution of samples 
≥0.001 g/100 g.
bFor units of % of total FAs, means and other statistics have the same properties as noted above for units of g/100 g milk. For a few minor FAs, the 
laboratory quantified up to 26 more samples in units of % of total FAs than it did in units of g/100 g, increasing the n- 
values shown here. In rare cases, 
the n- 
values differ also by ± 1 due to differences in the number of outliers removed.
cAn average of sums reported by the laboratory for each sample. The laboratory sums include minor FAs reported in Table S1 but not tabulated here, 
so they usually slightly exceed the sum of means for the individual FAs listed here.
dAn average of sums of all 7 FAs for each sample. This average is slightly smaller than the sum of means shown for each FA, because some of the latter 
means are substantially elevated by exclusion of values < 0.001 mg/100 g milk (footnotea).

adjusted grassmilk averages 43% more 20:5 EPA and 27% more 
22:5 DPA, two of three critical long- 
chain ω- 
3 FAs. The percent 
increase in 22:6 DHA cannot be calculated, because there was 
too little found in the conventional and organic samples tested 
in 2011–2012. We estimate that the absolute average increase 
in DHA is about 0.0006 g/100 g of milk (Table 3 footnote f). It is 
widely agreed that typical Western diets provide insufficient sup-
plies of long- 
chain ω- 
3 FAs, leading the European Food Standard 
Agency to recommend at least a doubling of average daily intakes 
of long- 
chain ω- 
3 FAs (EPA, DPA, and DHA), especially during 
pregnancy (EFSA, 2010).
Limited data from four small farms for Noble Milk in Italy show 
shifts in FA profile qualitatively similar to those in grassmilk, but 
smaller, as expected given the up to 30% grain and concentrates al-
lowed in cow rations (Lombardi et al., 2014). In Noble Milk, the ratios 
LA/ALA and ω-

3 are about 30% to 50% higher than in grassmilk. 
In the summer, Noble Milk reaches the annual average level in grass-
milk for ω- 
3 FAs and almost the annual average for total CLA, but 
both are substantially lower in other seasons. Total ω- 
6 is notably 
low both in Noble Milk (about as low as in grassmilk) and in Italian 
conventional milk (about 30% less than U.S. conventional milk re-
ported by Benbrook et al., 2013).
3.2 | Trans fatty acid concentrations
Total trans FA concentrations (excluding CLA) were one- 
third higher 
in grassmilk compared to the similar levels in the organic and con-
ventional milks shown in Table 3. Other studies have also found that 
pasture and forage- 
based feeds increase the levels of trans FA in milk, 
mainly trans- 
18:1, simultaneously with increases in CLA, a group of

aFor FAs reported in units of g/100 g milk, means and the other statistics are based on quantified amounts ≥0.001 g/100 g (samples <0.001 g/100 g 
not included). Hence, for minor FAs with n substantially <69, means are elevated, and other statistics are based on the distribution of samples 
≥0.001 g/100 g milk.
bFor units of % of total FAs, means and other statistics have the same properties as noted above for units of g/100 g milk. For a few minor FAs, the 
laboratory quantified up to 5 more samples in units of % of total FAs than it did in units of g/100 g milk, increasing the n- 
values shown here. In rare 
cases, the n- 
values differ also by ± 1 due to differences in the number of outliers removed.
cAn average of sums reported by the laboratory for each sample. The laboratory sums include minor FAs reported in Table S1 but not tabulated here, 
so they usually slightly exceed the sum of means for the individual FAs listed here.
dAn average of sums of all 7 FAs for each sample. This average is slightly smaller than the sum of means shown for each FA, because some of the latter 
means are substantially elevated by exclusion of values <0.001 mg/100 g milk (footnotea).

18:2 isomers, nearly all containing conjugated trans bonds (Daley et al., 
2010; Mansson, 2008; Vargas- 
Bello- 
Pérezz & Garnsworthy, 2013). 
Increases in total CLA are associated with the high ALA content of for-
age grasses (Elgersma, 2015), so forage feeding increases not only CLA 
and ω- 
3 FA levels in milk (Slots et al., 2009; Molkentin, 2009, but also 
trans FAs. Increased levels of CLA and ω- 
3 FAs in milk have been as-
sociated with health benefits (Larsson, Bergkvist, & Wolk, 2005; Smit, 
Baylin, & Campos, 2010; Stender & Dyerberg, 2003; Vargas- 
Bello- 
Pérezz & Garnsworthy, 2013).
Trans FA has a bad reputation because of evidence that sources 
from partially hydrogenated vegetable oils strongly increase LDL 
cholesterol, decrease HDL cholesterol, and have multiple other met-
abolic effects associated with CVD. These adverse findings are often 
assumed to apply equally to natural sources of trans FAs. However, 
such assumptions are unwarranted, because there are large differ-
ences between the two sources of trans FAs. First, industrial sources 
contain up to 60% trans FAs, compared to a maximum of 5 to 8% of 
FAs in milk (5.4% and 6.0% in Tables 1 and 2) (Stender & Dyerberg, 
2003). Second, the distribution of isomers differs greatly in the main 
trans FA in milk, trans- 
18:1 (about 72% and 75% of total trans FAs in 
Tables 1 and 2). In industrial sources, the position of the trans bond has 
a broad, near- 
Gaussian distribution from the 6th to the 16th carbon 
atom, whereas milk and other ruminant sources peak strongly at the 
11th carbon atom, with only small amounts at other positions (Stender 
& Dyerberg, 2003).
Trans- 
18:1 with the trans bond at the 11th carbon atom is vacce-
nic acid (VA), the major precursor to CLA (rumenic acid) in milk. At 
the high range of human intakes, VA has little or no adverse effect 
on risk factors for CVD (Lacroix et al., 2011). VA in the cow’s udder 
is partially converted to rumenic acid, the major CLA in milk (75% to 
90%) (Lock & Bauman, 2004; Tyburczy et al., 2008). Humans are also 
able to convert some VA in milk to this form of CLA (Lock & Bauman, 
2004; Turpeinen et al., 2002; Tyburczy et al., 2008). Despite having 
a trans double bond, rumenic acid has proven benefits in animals, es-
pecially anticarcinogenic activity against diverse cancer types (Lock 
& Bauman, 2004). In humans, there is suggestive support for activity 
against colon cancer from a large, epidemiological study in Sweden 
(Larsson et al., 2005) and possibly against breast cancer (Dilzer & 
Park, 2012).
For these reasons, the FDA exempts CLAs from its definition of 
trans FA for purposes of food labeling (FDA, 2003). Several countries 
and New York City exempt not only CLAs, but also ruminant trans 
FAs such as VA (Larsson et al., 2005; Table 2).
Motard- 
Bélanger et al. (2008) conducted a double- 
blind, ran-
domized crossover study of “high” and “moderate” dietary intakes 
of trans FAs from specially produced milk. They concluded that 
high intakes of these trans FAs “may adversely affect cholesterol 
homeostasis,” but that moderate intakes “that are well above the 
upper limit of current human consumption have neutral effects on 
plasma lipids and other cardiovascular risk factors.” Their “moder-
ate” intake was 4.2 g/2,500 kcal, where 4.2 g is the amount of total 
trans FAs in 2.64 kg of retail grassmilk (Table 2), or 10.8 servings 
of one cup (244 g). The “high” amount was 10.2 g/2,500 kcal, 2.43 
times higher than the “moderate” amount and far beyond even ex-
ceptionally high levels of dairy product consumption in the United 
States.
Moreover, there is some evidence of benefits from VA associated 
with its conversion to CLA (Kuhnt, Degen, & Jahreis, 2016). A re-
cent meta- 
analysis included 13 randomized, controlled intervention 
trials that used dairy products as the primary source of trans FA, 
in amounts as high as 4.2% of energy (10.9 g trans FA/2,500 kcal) 
(Gayet- 
Boyer, Tenenhaus- 
Aziza, Prunet, & Chardigny, 2014). The au-
thors found that these levels of trans FA have no harmful effects on 
HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, or their ratio.
Hence, there is a clear need to distinguish between natural and 
industrial sources of trans FA, but this will take time and careful re-
porting, because of long- 
standing assumptions to the contrary.
3.3 | Regional and seasonal differences
Our large, nationwide, 3- 
year dataset allows assessment of the 
regional and seasonal consistency in the impact of nearly 100% 
forage- 
based feed on the FA profile of grassmilk. Table 4 shows 
modest, but sometimes statistically significant, regional differ-
ences in grassmilk composition for total ω- 
6 and ω- 
3 FA. The high-
est average levels of ω- 
3 FAs in grassmilk came from the Midwest 
and Northeast (1.60% and 1.58% of total FA), while California 
had the lowest (1.40%), about a 14% difference. Likewise, the 
Midwest and Northeast had the two highest average concentra-
tions of total ω- 
6 FAs. For total CLA, there are no statistically 
significant regional differences. Average ratios of LA/ALA and ω- 
6/ω- 
3 varied by 7% across the 4 regions, but these differences

are not statistically significant (p > .05). There were no regional 
differences for the major FAs in milk—total saturated and total cis- 
monounsaturated FAs (not shown).
Some regional and seasonal variation in the FA profile of grass-
milk is expected, driven by differences in the quality and in botanical 
composition of fresh and stored forage (Ravetto Enri et al., 2017). 
Such variations are often triggered by climatic conditions that are 
most extreme during extended drought or heavy rains leading to 
water- 
logged soils or flooding. The length of the outdoor grazing 
period also impacts forage quality, as does management attention 
to sustaining a proper mix of grass and legume species in pastures 
(so that high- 
quality, immature forages are present in pastures from 
spring through the fall). The timing of forage harvests and how, 
and how well, forage- 
based feeds are conserved also impact for-
age composition. Despite all these factors, our results show that 
CROPP farmers switching to grassmilk standards have consistently 
improved milk FA composition over the broad range of agronomic 
and pedo- 
climatic conditions found in the United States.
Table 5 reports small but sometimes statistically significant dif-
ferences between years. The average ω- 
6/ω- 
3 ratio declined each 
year from 2014 to 2016, for an overall decline of 6% (p < .05). This 
decline results from a 3.2% decline in total ω- 
6 FAs and a 1.5% in-
crease in total ω- 
3 FAs (p > .05 for both). Many factors might contrib-
ute to these changes over 3 years, including improving management, 
changing climate or pasture conditions, or the increasing numbers of 
participating farms.
Seasonal highs and lows in grassmilk FAs are shown in Table 6, 
averaged over all 1,163 samples (2014–2016). The ω- 
6/ω- 
3 ratio 
peaked in July and bottomed in December, with a variation of 30% 
from low to high. For ω- 
6 and ω- 
3 levels, the maximum variation was 
somewhat less, 21% to 22%. The largest seasonal variation occurred 
in total CLA concentration, which more than doubled in September 
compared to April. Saturated and monounsaturated FA levels did not 
vary significantly by month (not shown).
Figure 1 shows the monthly variation in average ω- 
6/ω- 
3 ratio 
in all geographical regions during 2014–2016. Figure S1 shows sim-
ilar plots for the three separate geographical regions with the most 
samples (sample numbers are 85 for California, 582 for Midwest, 
and 442 for Northeast). The California region shows notably little 
monthly variation in ω- 
6/ω- 
3.
For Noble Milk, reported seasonal variations from four small 
farms in Italy are considerably larger than in grassmilk for total ω- 
3 
FAs (twofold larger) and total CLA (nearly threefold larger). However, 
seasonal variations in LA/ALA and ω- 
6/ω- 
3 are modest (Lombardi 
et al., 2014).

3.4 | Relationship between dairy rations and milk 
FA profile
All commercial dairy breeds descended from grazing herbivores. The 
more their diet strays from leafy vegetation, the greater the chal-
lenge to maintain gut health. The well- 
known effects of grain feed-
ing on milk FAs are caused by alterations in the normal functions of 
the cow rumen and its microbes (McDonald et al., 2006).
Combining the results of this study of CROPP grassmilk with our 
prior study of conventional milk and CROPP organic milk (Benbrook 
et al., 2013), we can estimate quantitative relationships between 
various levels of grain feeding of dairy cows and the FA composi-
tion of their milk. Table 7 shows these relationships for the ω- 
6/ω- 
3 
ratio and the content of total CLA. In addition to Grassmilk, Organic 
milk, and Conventional milk, we include an estimate for “Minimum 
Forages” milk from cows with no grazing and maximum amounts of 
grain. Most dairy cows in the United States now receive a very small 
share, or none of their annual DMI from grazing (0 to 3%). We esti-
mate that cows under “Minimum Forages” management get approxi-
mately 60% of DMI from corn silage and concentrate feeds, and 40% 
from dry or fermented alfalfa hay in a “total mixed ration” (mostly 
chopped, dry alfalfa hay). More commonly in the United States, cows 
under Conventional management receive somewhat less corn plus 
concentrate feeds (47%) and somewhat more stored forage (50%), 
with about 3% of annual DMI from grazing (total forages, 53%).
According to CROPP records, cows under Organic management 
on its farms receive about 56% of daily DMI from pasture during 
an average 183- 
day season and hence about 28% of their annual 
DMI from grazing. On CROPP farms producing Grassmilk, pasture 
accounts for an average 80% of DMI over a 190- 
day grazing season, 
or 42% of annual DMI. Stored, forage- 
based feeds add nearly 52% of 
daily DMI on Organic farms, and 58% on Grassmilk farms, bringing 
their totals from forage- 
based feeds to, respectively, about 80% and 
nearly 100% of DMI.
In the milk from these four management systems, the ratios 
of ω- 
6/ω- 
3 decline from an estimated 8 with Minimum Forages to 
measured values of 5.8 in Conventional milk, 2.3 in Organic milk, 
and 0.95 in Grassmilk (Table 7). Simultaneously, the annual average 
amounts of total CLA in conventional to retail grassmilk increase 
about fourfold from about 0.010 to 0.043 g/100 g milk. For total 
CLA, the impact of pasture and forage feeding appears to increase 
as their proportion of annual DMI increases beyond 80%, an obser-
vation that deserves further exploration.
In grain crops, stage of growth impacts the FA composition of 
feedstuffs in cow rations, as well as the FA profile of milk (Darby

3.5 | Nutrition modeling of grass milk effects on 
dietary LA/ALA ratios
Tables 1–3 show that increasing forage- 
based feeds in rations for 
lactating cows can significantly alter the FA profile of milk; however, 
a key question remains. Will consumption of dairy products from 
cows fed all, or mostly, forage- 
based feeds have a meaningful impact 
on human intakes of FAs, and potentially on public health?
To address this question, we modeled total LA and ALA intakes 
in the daily diet of a moderately active 19- 
 to 30- 
year- 
old women 
across 36 diet scenarios—18 diets with typical, high- 
LA foods such as 
regular margarine and other foods containing soy oil, and 18 mostly 
identical diets in which three foods lower in LA content were substi-
tuted (e.g., pita chips instead of corn chips, and margarine made with 
canola oil instead of soy oil).
The 18 scenarios in each of these two cases (high- 
 and low- 
LA 
intakes) entailed three levels of fat intake (20%, 33%, and 45% of 
total energy), two levels of dairy product consumption (3 and 4.5 
servings/day), and three variations of dairy fat (from cows managed 
under the conventional, organic, and grassmilk systems discussed 
here, with their varying reliance on grazing and forage rations shown 
in Table 7).
Our modeling focuses on total intakes of LA and ALA and the 
LA/ALA ratio (rather than ω- 
6, ω- 
3, and ω- 
6/ω- 
3), because the USDA 
does not publish sufficient and reliable data on the total ω- 
6 and ω- 
3 
contents of many common foods. But for many foods, it does report

reliable (fully differentiated) contents of LA and ALA. LA and ALA 
are, respectively, by far the major dietary ω- 
6 and ω- 
3 FAs in nearly 
all foods, so dietary ratios of LA/ALA are a reliable proxy for dietary 
ω- 
6/ω- 
3 ratios.
We assess the degree to which each of the 36 dietary scenarios 
reduces the LA/ALA from the baseline level of 11.3 for 3 servings/
day of conventional milk, typical- 
LA sources of nondairy fat, and 
33% of energy from fat. The lower the ratio, the greater the body’s 
ability to convert dietary ALA to the essential, longer- 
chain ω- 
3 FAs. 
This conversion is most important for pregnant and lactating women 
and for those who consume little or no oily fish (Brenna, 2002; 
Burdge & Calder, 2005). Oily fish are, per serving, superior sources 
for EPA and DHA, but even oily fish do not contain enough ALA 
to significantly alter dietary ratios of LA/ALA or ω- 
6/ω- 
3 (Benbrook 
et al., 2013; USDA, 2015).
Table 8 gives sample results from our nutrition modeling cal-
culations for four diets with typical intakes of total fat (33% of en-
ergy) and dairy fat with the FA profile of adjusted grassmilk. These 
four diets include those with moderate (recommended) (DHHS, 
2015) dairy intake (3 servings/day) and high dairy intake (4.5 serv-
ings/day), with either typical- 
LA or low- 
LA sources of nondairy 
fat. For these four diets, the table shows the dairy and nondairy 
contributions to dietary intakes of LA and ALA, the LA/ALA ratio 
and changes in this ratio relative to the baseline ratio of 11.33 for 
recommended intakes of conventional dairy products (Benbrook 
et al., 2013). Thus, it shows the impact on dietary LA/ALA ratios of 
switching from conventional to grassmilk dairy products for these 
four diets. We performed similar calculations for corresponding 
diets with low and high amounts of total dietary fat (20% and 45% 
of energy).
For a diet with typical total dietary fat (33% of energy), moder-
ate dairy servings, and typical- 
LA sources of nondairy fat, Table 8 
shows that a switch from conventional to adjusted grassmilk dairy 
products would decrease the overall dietary LA/ALA ratio by 2.68 
to 8.64 from the baseline ratio of 11.33. Adding 1.5 servings/day, 
for a total of 4.5 servings/day of dairy products, would further lower 
the LA/ALA ratio to 5.95—a total drop of 5.37. These are substantial 
decreases. For corresponding diets with low- 
LA sources of nondairy 
fat, the reductions in LA/ALA ratio are even larger, by 7.31 and 8.19, 
respectively, for moderate and high consumption of dairy products.
As we discuss below, reductions in dietary LA/ALA ratios of this 
magnitude seem of potential public health significance. Much of the 
reductions can be achieved with grassmilk dairy products alone, 
without reducing intakes of nondairy LA. The opportunity to reduce 
total dietary LA/ALA ratios from 11.33 to as low as 3.14, and without 
major changes in dietary patterns, seems notable to us. In our model 
diets, there are no changes in most foods, including French fries, 
chocolate chip cookies, chicken, pork, and beef. The modeled food 
choices represent an attainable option to improve FA intakes in ways 
that will likely reduce the risk for cardiovascular and other metabolic 
disorders, at least for some individuals. Many other factors—genet-
ics, age, health status, and environmental exposures—will interact 
in determining the magnitude of such impacts (Simopoulos, 2006).
Figure 2 shows the full results of our nutrition modeling, includ-
ing diets with low and high intakes of total dietary fat (20% and 45% 
of energy). For diets with typical- 
LA nondairy fat sources (left side 
of Figure 2), the decreases in dietary LA/ALA ratios are enhanced in 
the diets with only 20% of energy from fat and attenuated in high- 
fat diets. For diets with low- 
LA nondairy fat sources (right side of 
Figure 2), there is little dependence on the overall level of dietary 
fat, but the reductions in dietary LA/ALA ratio are much larger, 
including even with conventional dairy fat. Organic and grassmilk 
dairy fat have the most impact on diets with typical- 
LA nondairy fat, 
compared to diets with low- 
LA nondairy fat.

BENBROOK Et al.
For typical diets with 33% of energy from fat and typical- 
LA non-
dairy fat (left side of Figure 2), switching from moderate amounts of 
conventional to high amounts of grassmilk dairy products reduces 
the LA/ALA ratio from 11.33 to 5.95, a 47% reduction. The same 
switch for diets with low- 
LA nondairy fat decreases the LA/ALA 
ratio from 5.11 to 3.14.
LA and ALA are essential human nutrients, but they both comple-
ment and compete with each other, and their dietary ratio matters. 
They are elongated by parallel and competing pathways to, respec-
tively, AA (from LA) and EPA (from ALA), which in turn are converted 
into eicosanoids that regulate many body functions. Eicosanoids 
derived from AA are proinflammatory and thrombogenic, and sev-
eral have been linked to carcinogenesis, whereas those derived from 
ALA tend to suppress inflammation, thrombosis, and carcinogenesis, 
especially when the ω- 
6/ω- 
3 ratio approaches 1 (Larsson, Kumlin, 
Ingelman- 
Sundberg, & Wolk, 2004).
Thus, a large excess of dietary LA compared to ALA can increase 
the risk of CVD, cancer, and other diseases (Burdge & Calder, 2005; 
Ramsden, Hibbeln, Majchrzak, & Davis, 2010; Siri- 
Tarino, Chiu, 
Bergeron, & Krauss, 2015). For some, and perhaps most people in 
the United States, high- 
LA intakes reduce the quantity of ALA con-
verted to EPA and its related eicosanoids and also reduce the con-
version of ALA to DHA.
DHA is independently important, because it is required in the de-
velopment of the infant brain and ocular system (Ailhaud, Massiera, 
Alessandri, & Guesnet, 2007; Donahue et al., 2011), as discussed 
further below.
Impaired conversion of ALA to EPA and DHA is of considerable 
concern in the United States, because most Americans do not con-
sume adequate fish to meet the recommended average intake of 
250 mg/day of EPA + DHA (DHHS, 2015; EPA, 2002). Hence, they 
must partly rely on dietary intake of EPA and DHA from meat and 
dairy products or supplements. Indeed, in the late 1990s, over 70% 
of Americans age 18 or older consumed no fish and shellfish (EPA, 
2002).
3.6 | Contribution of grass milk dairy products and 
fish to fatty acid intakes
Oily fish are the ultimate, direct source of the long- 
chain ω- 
3 PUFAs, 
EPA, DPA, and DHA. DHA is present at very low concentrations in 
other foods, including grass milk, but it plays a vital role in the de-
velopment of an infant’s and child’s brain, eyes, and nervous sys-
tem (Bondi et al., 2013; Moon et al., 2013; Ryan et al., 2010). For the 
70% of Americans who consume essentially no fish, the efficiency 
of conversion of ALA to long- 
chain ω- 
3 FAs is critically important, 
especially for those with elevated need, such as growing children 
and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. For this conversion, 
ALA from dairy products and other foods plays dual roles. First as a 
precursor to EPA, DPA, and DHA, and second by decreasing the LA/
ALA ratio, and hence the tendency of LA to capture and utilize the 
enzymes needed to convert ALA to long- 
chain ω- 
3 FAs.
Although high in long- 
chain ω- 
3 FAs, oily fish do not contain 
significant amounts of either LA or ALA, and for this reason, fish

consumption does not significantly impact overall dietary ratios of 
LA/ALA or ω- 
6/ω- 
3. Benbrook et al. (2013) used USDA data on the 
FA contents of seven commonly consumed fish species (canned tuna, 
tilapia, halibut, sockeye salmon, catfish, trout, and Atlantic salmon) 
to calculate the amounts of LA, ALA, EPA, DPA, and DHA from 8 
ounces of fish per week, the amount recommended in the Dietary 
Guidelines for Americans (DHHS, 2015). This weekly amount of the 
7 fish species supplies between 1 (canned light tuna) to 58 mg/day 
(Atlantic salmon) of ALA, with an average of 20 mg/day (Table 4 in 
Benbrook et al., 2013). This daily amount of ALA is small compared 
to the 137 mg in 1.5 cups of grassmilk, or the 162 mg in a 1.5- 
ounce 
serving of cheddar cheese made from grassmilk (see below).
Table 9 shows the amounts of key FA from grassmilk dairy prod-
ucts in our dietary modeling. These amounts complement the data pre-
sented in Table 3 of Benbrook et al. (2013) for conventional and organic 
dairy products. Table 9 also shows the FA content of the 7 commonly 
consumed fish mentioned above. In addition to these recommended 
amounts of dairy and fish (DHHS, 2015), Table 9 also shows the FA 
content of the lower, actual per- 
capita consumptions of dairy prod-
ucts (270 g/day) and fish (9.1 g/day). Actual, average per- 
capita intakes 
are 28% of recommended for fish and 42% of recommended for dairy 
products (Lin, Variyam, Allshouse, & Cromartie, 2003).
Based on average per- 
capita consumption of dairy products and 
fish, grassmilk dairy products would supply 31 times more ALA than 
fish, 4.5 times more LA, 37% as much EPA, 1.2 times more DPA, but 
only about 3% of the DHA. Grassmilk dairy products supply 29% as 
much total long- 
chain FA (EPA + DPA + DHA) as fish, with a much 
lower overall LA/ALA ratio (0.95 versus 6.5).
4 | CONCLUSIONS
We find that nearly 100% grass- 
 and legume- 
based feeding of lac-
tating dairy cows typically yields milk fat with ratios of LA/ALA and 
ω- 
6/ω- 
3 close to 1, compared to 5.8 for milk from cows on conven-
tionally managed farms, and 2.3 for typical (but not nearly 100% 
grass- 
fed) organic dairy farms. Our dietary modeling scenarios show 
that replacing recommended daily servings of conventional dairy 
products with grassmilk products and avoiding some foods high in 
LA could substantially decrease historically high dietary ratios of 
LA/ALA (and thus ω- 
6/ω- 
3 ratios) from current values of >10 to as 
low as 3.1. Such decreases have several potential health benefits, 
including an enhanced ability to convert dietary ALA to the long- 
chain ω- 
3 FAs EPA, DPA, and DHA. These nutrients are typically not 
consumed at recommended levels (DHHS, 2015), and are especially 
needed during pregnancy and lactation, by children, and by the ma-
jority of Americans who eat little or no fish.
Because of the widely varying FA profile of dairy products de-
pending on production systems, coupled with large variations in 
their fat content (whole, reduced fat, and fat free), the widely dis-
seminated promotional claim “milk is milk” (Dairy Reporter, 2003) is 
hard to square with the nature of dairy products currently sold and 
consumed in the United States and elsewhere.
Shifting lactating dairy cows to rations containing substantial 
portions of forage- 
based feeds and less grain dramatically decreases 
the amounts of LA in milk, while also elevating levels of ALA, long- 
chain ω- 
3 FAs, and total CLA. These attainable shifts in the FA pro-
file of milk and dairy products are one of several practical ways to 
potentially improve the quality of American diets. The shifts can be 
accomplished with existing dairy industry infrastructure and with 
likely modest impact on food expenditures after a transition period.
Improved messages from government dietary recommendations 
(Nissen, 2016) and food labeling reforms should, over time, increase 
consumer demand for grass- 
fed beef, milk, and other livestock prod-
ucts. Differentiating more clearly between the FAs implicated or not 
implicated in the risks for obesity, CVD, and metabolic syndrome will 
be an additional important step forward.
Further research is needed to determine realistically attainable 
shifts in FA consumption in the wide diversity of diets across the 
U.S. population and to assess the cost of alternative paths toward 
healthier fat intakes. Likewise, further research is needed to identify 
profitable and scalable changes in livestock feed rations and food 
manufacturing that will lower dietary ω- 
6/ω- 
3 ratios and increase in-
takes of long- 
chain ω- 
3 FAs and CLA. Improved understanding of the 
relationship between fat quality and health outcomes will help guide 
livestock and dairy farmers, the food industry, government agencies, 
scientists, and physicians searching for promising ways to promote 
public health.

APPENDIX 
Grass milk standards and oversight
In 2016, a coalition of dairy industry and certification organiza-
tions defined a broad national standard for “100% Grass- 
fed dairy” 
(AGA, 2016). These organizations included Pennsylvania Certified 
Organic, American Grassfed Association, Northeast Organic 
Farming Association [New York (NOFA- 
NY, 2016) & Vermont chap-
ters], Maple Hill Creamery, and CROPP Cooperative. That coalition 
adopted CROPP’s Grassmilk standards as part of its consensus 
standard. CROPP’s internal standards currently comply with the na-
tional consensus, and the cooperative continues to take an active 
role in solidifying the language and certification requirements asso-
ciated with nearly 100% grass- 
fed dairy claims.
Feeding requirements
In addition to the dry hay and fermented hay feeds that are al-
lowed on grass milk farms, CROPP’s grassmilk standard allows the 
feeding of preboot cereal crops. These plants do not contain mature 
seeds, only plant foliage and stem material. The distinction between 
grain and foliage from preboot cereal grain crops is based on starch 
content. Starch is associated with an increase in ω- 
6 FAs in the feed 
and in the resulting milk.
Some farmers transitioning cows to nearly 100%- 
forage diets, or 
managing grass milk herds, need the option to include preboot cereal 
crops in their conserved feeds. Such feeds increase the energy con-
tent of the ration and help sustain cow body condition. They help 
minimize ω- 
6 FAs in the ration and protect the integrity of “no grain” 
claims in grass milk marketing.
Animal-care requirements
Beyond fat quality, consumers are also increasingly interested in 
animal welfare. A variety of indicators associated with animal wel-
fare and herd health are finding their way into certification require-
ments. These metrics include the body condition of lactating cows, 
outdoor access, use of antibiotics and hormones, physical altera-
tions, lameness, living conditions, and sources of animal stress.
CROPP grassmilk farmers are subject to the same animal- 
care re-
porting and herd- 
health verifications that are used throughout the 
cooperative. These include the National Milk Farmers Assuring 
Responsible Management (FARM) requirements for body condition, 
lameness, access to outdoors and water, ventilation, and handling. 
Some CROPP animal- 
welfare requirements go beyond those im-
posed by FARM, such as prohibition of oxytocin, a drug used to as-
sist in calving.
On- 
site audits are performed by staff animal- 
care specialists and 
qualified field staff at least every third year throughout a farm’s tran-
sition and participation in the program. Audit follow- 
up addresses 
any concerns and sets forth required improvements. Routine visits

by CROPP staff also help track and troubleshoot any problems 
unique to a given farm or region.
Expert advice is available to grassmilk farmers to help them im-
prove their forage quality and production levels, cow health, and 
profitability. Regular testing of bulk- 
tank milk FA levels is used to 
monitor compliance with the nearly 100% forage- 
based feed 
requirement.
Challenges and benefits of increasing reliance on forage-based 
feeds
Increasing forage- 
based feeds usually reduces milk production. 
Across farms of all sizes in 2014, rolling- 
herd- 
average (RHA) 305- 
day 
milk production was 14,513 lb/cow on grazing farms, 14,758 lb on 
organic farms, and 21,862 lb on conventional farms (APHIS, 2014).
Within CROPP, organic dairies feeding ~20% of DMI from grains 
have RHAs in the range 14,000 to 18,000 lb/cow, while most 
grassmilk operations achieve RHAs in the range 6,000 to 16,000 lb/
cow. During the spring and early summer, cows in early lactation 
tend to produce more milk, making it difficult to meet energy needs, 
especially without a supplemental energy source (e.g., molasses).
Increased reliance on grazing and forage- 
based diets requires 
careful management of soil fertility, pasture composition, forage 
production, and animal health (especially locomotion). Annual and 
perennial forage crops are managed collectively throughout the year 
to provide for both grazing and conserved winter feed. The extreme 
reliance on pasture and conserved forages may make these farms 
less resilient in the face of prolonged drought conditions. It remains 
to be seen whether availability and cost of high- 
quality, off- 
farm 
conserved forage put these farms at increased risk during periods of 
prolonged drought, leading to near- 
complete forage crop/pasture 
losses.
In addition to challenges, grass milk farmers receive benefits. 
These include a price premium (about 15% on CROPP farms), gen-
erally reduced feed costs, and protection from price spikes in or-
ganic grains and grain- 
based supplements. Agronomically, these 
farms generally have more tolerance for wet springs, which can 
delay row- 
crop farming practices and increase weed management 
challenges.
Environmental benefits also accompany the shift to greater reli-
ance on forage- 
based feeds and the increased acreage in perennial 
grass communities. Soil health tends to improve, because of reduced 
tillage and year- 
round perennial grass cover. This improvement in 
soil health generally results in reduced soil erosion and less sediment 
and nutrient run- 
off into local watersheds compared to conventional 
tillage, or conservation tillage- 
based crop rotations.
