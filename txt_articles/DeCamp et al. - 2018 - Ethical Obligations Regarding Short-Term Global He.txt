Experiences: An American College of Physicians Position Paper

Ethics, Professionalism and Human Rights Committee*
This American College of Physicians position paper aims to in-
form ethical decision making surrounding participation in short-
term global health clinical care experiences. Although the posi-
tions are primarily intended for practicing physicians, they may
apply to other health care professionals and should inform how
institutions, organizations, and others structure short-term global
health experiences. The primary goal of short-term global health
clinical care experiences is to improve the health and well-being
of the individuals and communities where they occur. In addi-
tion, potential benefits for participants in global health include
increased awareness of global health issues, new medical knowl-
edge, enhanced physical diagnosis skills when practicing in low-
technology settings, improved language skills, enhanced cul-
tural sensitivity, a greater capacity for clinical problem solving,
and an improved sense of self-satisfaction or professional satis-
faction. However, these activities involve several ethical chal-
lenges. Addressing these challenges is critical to protecting
patient welfare in all geographic locales, promoting fair and eq-
uitable care globally, and maintaining trust in the profession.
This paper describes 5 core positions that focus on ethics and
the clinical care context and provides case scenarios to illustrate
them.

E
thics resources and best practice guidelines for
short-term global health clinical care experiences
focus on medical trainees and training programs (1–8).
There is a need to translate guidelines and apply ethi-
cal principles from the American College of Physicians
(ACP) Ethics Manual to practicing physicians engaged
in global health activities (9) in nontraining capacities.
The Ethics Manual (10) notes, “Physicians have an
important role to play in promoting health and human
rights and addressing social inequities. This includes
caring for vulnerable populations.” This is true both lo-
cally and globally. Over the past 2 decades, global
health activities involving medical trainees (11–13) and
practicing physicians (14–16) have expanded, with hun-
dreds of millions of dollars in direct expenditures (4, 17,
18). With potential benefits of global health participation
(19–23), including the potential to influence how and
where physicians practice at home (for example, in under-
served settings [13, 24–27]), come ethical challenges.
These include respecting different cultural norms, avoid-
ing unintended harms, protecting privacy, working within
one's scope of practice, and managing resource con-
straints and priority setting (28). Evidence of positive long-
term health effects has been lacking (29, 30), except in
long-term, sustainable partnerships (31).
The term “short-term experience in global health”
(STEGH) (12) as used here covers a range of clinical
care and educational activities and is intentionally
broad. “Short-term” refers to activities lasting a few
days to several months. “Global health” could techni-
cally include any health-related activity anywhere in the
world. This position paper follows others that have
noted that global health typically emphasizes vulnera-
ble populations in underserved settings (9). As used
here, “experiences in global health” refers to circum-
stances where physicians from high-income countries
travel to low- or middle-income countries or to under-
served areas in high-income countries. Comprehensive
review of ethical challenges is beyond the scope of this
paper; for example, ethical challenges in international
research is a rich and distinct field. This paper focuses
on STEGHs, but these positions could also inform ca-
reer global health work (32) or local activities in under-
served settings.

POSITIONS
Position 1: Physicians' primary ethical obligation in
short-term global health experiences is to improve the
health and well-being of the individuals and communi-
ties they visit.
A physician's primary ethical obligation is to the
welfare of individual patients, not his or her own inter-
ests (10). The principles of beneficence and nonmalefi-
cence (“do no harm”) apply in the short-term global
health setting. Evidence suggests the potential for un-
intended but real harms (22, 33–42) (see the Table for
vignettes).
Best practice guidelines (2, 6) and recent literature
(12) no longer consider short-term global health work
as pure altruism or “something that is better than noth-
ing” (43). Instead, STEGHs must demonstrate real ben-
efit to the local community, with a goal of sustainability.
Benefits could be short-term (such as relief of suffering
or provision of needed medications or health care ser-
vices) or long-term (such as treating to cure certain
medical or surgical problems; educating local health
care professionals; building health care infrastructure;
or increasing awareness of global health inequalities
that motivates long-term, sustainable change).
A few general recommendations can be made with
regard to obligations of beneficence and nonmalefi-
cence. First, the benefits of STEGHs should be “desired
by and the interventions acceptable to” the local com-
munity (10) (Table [position 1, scenario B]). Short-term
experiences in global health may involve physicians at
different levels of training or students. Expected bene-
fits must be balanced with potential risks on the basis of
participant experience and training level. Because the
STEGH participant cannot always determine what is
most beneficial abroad, humility about one's knowl-
edge and expertise is an important component of
beneficence (44).
Second, beneficence requires adherence to exist-
ing ethical standards. For example, the dilemma of
whether to use expired medicines sometimes arises in
this context (Table [position 1, scenario A]). Existing
guidelines from the World Health Organization usually
prohibit such use, citing unintended harms and an eth-
ical double standard (45), although some prescription
drugs may retain potency after the manufacturer's ex-
piration date (46).
Third, physicians should not exceed their scope of
practice, even though local regulations may be less re-
strictive in other countries. When the need is urgent
enough to raise consideration of exceeding one's scope,
careful forethought and informed consent (47) are re-
quired at a minimum. Medical students, residents,
and postgraduate trainees should not exceed their
level of training. Local licensing requirements must
be adhered to.
Finally, physicians' actions should not detract from
local clinicians and resources. Supporting the local
community may foster long-term, sustainable change
(Table [position 1, scenario B]).
Patient and community welfare has primacy, but
that does not mean that educational benefit for physi-
cian participants does not matter ethically. However,
STEGHs can occur in contexts of power imbalance for
historical, political, resource, and other reasons. Special
efforts may be required to ensure unequivocal focus on
benefits to the community as decided by the commu-
nity (see position 3).
Position 2: The ethical principle of justice requires
partnering with local leaders to ensure that the potential
burdens participants can place on local communities
abroad are minimized and preparing for limited mate-
rial resources.
Justice requires that physicians “seek to equitably
distribute the life-enhancing opportunities afforded by
health care” (10). In many STEGH settings, certain ma-
terial resources may be far more limited than in physi-
cians' usual practice settings (Table [position 2]), pre-
senting ethical challenges. Clinical resource limitations
may be the most obvious, but ensuring that physician
participants do not burden the host site is equally im-
portant. Examples of potential burdens include tangi-
ble costs (such as licensure; lodging; food; transporta-
tion; care in the event of acute illness, such as travelers'
diarrhea; or measures to protect the physical safety of
physician volunteers) and intangible ones (for example,
causing local practitioners to shift their time and efforts
toward the visiting team or expanding or supplanting
their usual obligations).
Managing such burdens requires first recognizing
them. Volunteers may lack knowledge of local circum-
stances, necessitating partnership with local community
leaders. The full cost to local communities should be
calculated and reimbursed (2). Protecting the safety of
physician volunteers (such as during travel or using per-
sonal protective equipment) may require actions on the
part of the local community, the organization, and the
volunteer, but financial responsibility rests with the or-
ganizations that send volunteers. Although organiza-
tions typically provide reimbursement, individual physi-
cians must be cognizant of potential burdens created
by their presence (Table [position 2, scenario A]), take
steps to minimize them, and report them to the send-
ing organization. Responsibility for medical care of phy-
sician participants, including medical evacuation if nec-
essary, rests with the sending organization.

 Ensuring just distribution of limited resources is an-
other possible ethical challenge. This may occur for
many resources, such as diagnostics, therapeutics, and
personal protective equipment. Managing ethical ten-
sions among the welfare of the individual patient, effi-
ciency, and equitable distribution with special concern
for vulnerable patients is challenging. The best balance
should be decided among all stakeholders, with ap-
propriate deference to local community values (Ta-
ble [position 2, scenario B]) and in advance rather
than during an individual patient encounter when
possible (10).
Position 3: The ethical principle of respect for per-
sons, including being sensitive to and respectful of cul-
tural differences, is essential to short-term global medi-
cal experiences.
Physicians are obligated to provide culturally sen-
sitive care that does not presume the correctness of any
one culture's view (the physician's or the patient's) (10).

Statement
Contrasting Case Vignettes
Scenario A
Scenario B
1
Physicians' primary ethical obligation
in short-term global health
experiences is to improve the
health and well-being of the
individuals and communities they
visit.
During a short-term medical trip to Latin America,
a physician notices that the supporting
organization sent a 30-day supply of presorted
packets of donated antihypertensive
medications that recently expired. The
community will have no access to these
medications after the team leaves. The
organization also sent electronic
sphygmomanometers, but without reliable
electricity, they are rarely used. During the trip,
the physician observes that patients
preferentially see the U.S. physicians over the
local physicians. She wonders whether they
have done more harm than good.
A physician with vast experience in HIV
care engages in a short-term global
health project related to improving
HIV care in an African country. The
organization's primary mission is to
partner with the local health
community. As a result, the physician
supports the local clinical staff and
their patient care and does not
administer direct care or dispense
medications. This allows the
community to develop the skills to
care for their population in the way
locals see fit.
2
The ethical principle of justice
requires partnering with local
leaders to ensure that the potential
burdens participants can place on
local communities abroad are
minimized and preparing for
limited material resources.
During a short-term medical trip, a team member
notices that the local community is going out of
its way to provide lodging, food, and
transportation. “I don't want to be rude,” he
thinks, “but wouldn't these resources be better
used elsewhere?” At the same time, as the
clinic runs out of HIV medication, he begins to
wonder whom he should treat first and what
the effect will be on patients later that day,
week, or year.
While planning a short-term medical
trip, a physician volunteer notices
that the sponsoring organization has
a relationship with local community
leaders. The volunteer works with
these leaders to determine which
costs the visiting group could
reimburse or offset (e.g., travel,
licensure, and salaries of the host
abroad). They make contingency
plans in case resources, such as
medications, run out. During the
STEGH, the physician senses how
the process led to a deeper
understanding of and partnership
with the local community.
3
The ethical principle of respect for
persons, including being sensitive
to and respectful of cultural
differences, is essential to
short-term global medical
experiences.
A female physician travels abroad believing that
she is fluent in the local language and aware of
local customs, but quickly notices that she has
trouble understanding the local dialect.
Moreover, her attire—skirts above the knee and
sleeveless shirts—offends local patients and
staff. Out of concern for alienating a global
partner, the locals do not feel they should
inform her of this.
Before a short-term medical trip, the
team prepares by learning about not
just the local community's language
but also its health beliefs and
culture. During the STEGH, a
physician team member remarks to
another how their health education
effort was therefore well-received
and likely more effective.
4
Predeparture preparation is itself an
ethical obligation. It should
incorporate preparation for
logistical and ethical aspects of
STEGHs, including the potential for
ethical challenges and moral
distress.
A physician who is less than a year out of
residency arranges a short-term medical trip to
rural Africa. The STEGH has a supporting
organization but no predeparture preparation.
After arrival, she notices that the clinic is
significantly understaffed. The lone physician in
the clinic, who has not had a day off in months,
orients her briefly and asks to take time off for
needed and deserved rest. The visiting
physician feels obligated to stay but quickly
becomes overwhelmed by not having the
resources she is accustomed to at home. She
even witnesses a patient die of a condition she
could have treated at home. She wonders
whether she did the right thing.
A physician returns from a short-term
medical trip with residual concerns
over her experiences—the limited
resources, cultural differences, and
concern over whether she made any
difference. Fortunately, in advance
of the STEGH, the organization
prepared her for this possibility, and
she established a relationship with a
mentor experienced in global
health. She maintained contact with
her mentor when difficulties arose
during the STEGH. The organization
sponsoring her STEGH included
posttrip debriefing to relieve this
distress.
STEGH = short-term experience in global health.

 served settings may make cultural differences more ev-
ident (Table [position 3]).
Cultural sensitivity respects individual and commu-
nity choice, privacy, and truth telling. Respect is also a
critical component of global health ethics frameworks
that emphasize solidarity (collective obligations based
on social reciprocity) (48, 49). Local communities may
place greater importance on STEGHs as expressions of
solidarity than on the tangible benefits they provide
(50, 51).
Respect for persons is important in its own right;
physicians must demonstrate not only cultural compe-
tence but also cultural humility (10). This entails being
respectful of different cultural views about the role of
medicine in society and its goals. At the same time,
certain values may transcend cultures, and being
abroad does not reduce their importance. For exam-
ple, physicians abroad should respect individual pa-
tient choice, privacy, and confidentiality by not sharing
images or other personal health information without
consent, including on social media (52, 53).
Respect also helps facilitate the obligations stated
in positions 1 and 2. By humbly respecting cultural dif-
ferences, STEGH physicians can help mitigate power
imbalances between local communities and sending or-
ganizations (which may have more financial resources) or
between volunteer physicians and local communities
(who may perceive the volunteer team as inherently “bet-
ter” physicians). Either could inappropriately influence de-
cisions about mutual benefit and fair resource allocation.
One way to fulfill these obligations is to partner with local
community members (and other overlapping global
health efforts if applicable [54]) before, during, and after
STEGHs (55, 56).
Respectful partnership helps ensure that efforts are
consistent with community values and self-identified
needs (position 1), which increases the likelihood of
lasting benefit (Table [position 3, scenario B]). Finally,
partnership reveals burdens on the host through ongo-
ing dialogue (some burdens may not be readily appar-
ent to STEGH participants) and is also necessary for
difficult
discussions
about
fair
resource
allocation
(position 2).
The physician's general orientation abroad should
be one of a humble visitor who is respectful of cultural
differences. However, physicians should not shirk their
ethical duties and are “not required to violate funda-
mental personal values, standards of medical care or
ethical practice, or the law” (10). For example, radical
differences in how some cultures treat persons of
different genders may cause a physician to wonder
whether to conform, tolerate the treatment, try to
change it, or even leave. Potential differences of such
gravity must be elucidated and explored in advance of
STEGHs. When such differences do occur, physicians
should reach out to trusted mentors and peers in their
home country, at the sponsoring organization, or in the
local community to learn how best to respond.
Position 4: Predeparture preparation is itself an eth-
ical obligation. It should incorporate preparation for lo-
gistical and ethical aspects of STEGHs, including the po-
tential for ethical challenges and moral distress.
Many ethical guidelines and recommendations ex-
ist for STEGHs (2, 4, 6, 12, 28, 57–60). Predeparture
training has been (61) and continues to be (62) ethically
necessary to help physicians avoid some of the ethical
pitfalls of short-term global health work (63).
Organizations that sponsor or support STEGHs
may be primarily responsible for predeparture training.
It should be tailored to the community where the expe-
rience will occur. Recommended topics include logis-
tics (such as immunizations and predeparture medical
screening, travel insurance, and appropriate licensure);
planning for adequate supervision (especially for train-
ees); personal safety (such as road and travel safety or
personal protective equipment needs); and, where
applicable, malaria prophylaxis or health information
needed to stay well while abroad. Education in local
health and health system issues, history, culture, lan-
guage, and ethics is also essential (64, 65).
Physicians should explicitly prepare for the possi-
bility of ethical dilemmas and moral distress before,
during, and after STEGHs (22, 66–68). Moral distress
can occur if physicians are unable to act in ways that are
consistent with ethics and their professional values or if
they feel complicit in a moral wrong (Table [position 4,
scenario A]). Moral distress is frequently accompanied
by a sense of powerlessness, which can lead to depro-
fessionalization, burnout, decreased quality of care, or
lasting negative emotions (69).
Organizations sponsoring or supporting STEGHs
should prepare physicians for the ethical challenges
they are likely to encounter and should formally debrief
the experience afterward (70) (Table [position 4, sce-
nario B]). Individually, physicians can develop and ap-
ply strategies for moral resilience. Physicians should
have a mentor in their home country (who may also be
a fellow traveler) and in the local community to discuss
ethical concerns before, during, and after the STEGH
and may find moral resilience strategies (71, 72) help-
ful. For example, regularly assessing one's emotions
and actions surrounding the experience of ethical chal-
lenges abroad, documenting them in a journal, and
sharing them with peers could help build moral resil-
ience (72). Mobile technology and increased connectiv-
ity make this possible in real time.
Self-paced online resources on a range of global
health topics allow participants to supplement organi-
zational preparation (73–75). More specific ethics prep-
aration (76–79) and book-length manuals (80) are also
available. Although many resources focus on medical
trainees (medical students, residents, and fellows),
“trainee” should be interpreted broadly. Any STEGH
participant
with
limited
global
health
experience
should, for the sake of humility, consider themselves a
trainee.
In the future, predeparture training for STEGHs
should be improved to target seasoned clinicians and
evaluate the effect of training and training method on
participant knowledge, skills, attitudes, and beliefs, as
well as the long-term sustainability and effectiveness of

 short-term programs (81). Greater attention to monitor-
ing and managing ethical challenges for all STEGH par-
ticipants, including partners abroad, is also needed.
Position 5: Physicians should participate with orga-
nizations whose STEGHs are consistent with ethics and
professionalism as exemplified in these positions.
Physicians who engage with organizations that spon-
sor short-term global health work may not be in the best
position to influence decisions about such issues as ben-
efits or resource allocation. Nevertheless, by choosing or-
ganizations that sponsor ethical STEGHs, physicians can
maintain their professional integrity, serve underserved
populations, and indirectly influence how short-term
global efforts are organized.
No single checklist exists for physicians to use in guid-
ing their choice, although some have been proposed for
medical trainees (82). Best practice guidelines and re-
sources can help physicians articulate questions to ask be-
fore committing to a particular organization that sponsors
STEGHs. Physicians are obligated to report problematic
STEGH practices to the administrative leadership of the
organization sponsoring the trip (and, if necessary, to
medical licensing bodies when applicable). For-profit
global medical volunteer or tourism organizations may re-
quire special scrutiny because of the tension between
profit margins and maximal benefit to communities
abroad.
Although STEGHs with long-standing partnerships
with host communities and organizations abroad are pre-
ferred, there is no “one-size-fits-all” approach to ethics in
STEGHs. For example, natural disasters or severe pan-
demics may pose additional or different ethical chal-
lenges. Therefore, evaluation must also be sensitive to lo-
cal context and needs. Short-term experiences in global
health may initially not be fully sustainable (due to uncer-
tain funding, local political circumstances, or other fac-
tors), but they may lead to sustainable, partnered efforts
in the future or be ethically justified by short-term bene-
fits, such as relief of suffering in areas of violence or hu-
manitarian crises. In contrast, more can reasonably be ex-
pected in terms of positive effect, capacity building, and
sustainability from a program that has operated for sev-
eral years in the same location.
Evaluation is therefore itself an ethical obligation.
Organizations that sponsor STEGHs should evaluate
their effect, and physicians should choose organiza-
tions that are committed to evaluation. Progress to-
ward the goals described in these positions requires
evaluation timelines and benchmarks that create ac-
countability for STEGHs. These should include process
measures (such as the number of patients seen or local
community involvement), outcome measures (for ex-
ample, local health outcomes, capacity built, or rela-
tionships developed), and full cost accounting. Ideally,
evaluations should be designed and conducted by or
with the local community.
CONCLUSION
Physicians who participate in STEGHs have ethical
duties and special obligations to advocate for sustain-
able, mutual benefit; a fair and equitable distribution of
resources; and partnership with and respect for the in-
dividuals and communities they serve. These principles
inform physician decision making surrounding short-term
experiences and can positively influence how STEGHs are
done. By adhering to these principles, physicians can help
maintain trust in a profession committed to protecting pa-
tient well-being and improving health equity at home and
abroad.
