Residential greenness and prevalence of major depressive 
disorders: a cross-sectional, observational, associational 
study of 94 879 adult UK Biobank participants
Chinmoy Sarkar, Chris Webster, John Gallacher
Summary
Background Increased urbanisation and the associated reduced contact of individuals with natural environments have 
led to a rise in mental disorders, including depression. Residential greenness, a fundamental component of urban 
design, has been shown to reduce the public health burden of mental disorders. The present study investigates the 
association between residential green exposure and prevalence of major depressive disorders using a large and 
diverse cross-sectional dataset from the UK Biobank.
Methods In this cross-sectional, observational, associational study, we used baseline data from the UK Biobank 
cohort of participants aged 37–73 years from across the UK. Environmental exposure data were derived from a 
modelled and linked built environment database. Residential greenness was assessed with a 0·5 m resolution 
Normalised Difference Vegetation Index, which is derived from spectral reflectance measurements in remotely 
sensed colour infrared data and measured within geocoded dwelling catchments. Other environment metrics 
included street-level movement density, terrain, and fine particulate exposures. A series of logistic models examined 
associations between residential greenness and odds of major depressive disorder after adjusting for 
activity-influencing environments and individual covariates.
Findings Of 122 993 participants with data on major depressive disorder, the study analytical sample comprised 
94 879 (77·1%) participants recruited across ten UK Biobank assessment centres between April 29, 2009, and 
Oct 1, 2010. A protective effect of greenness on depression was consistently observed, with 4·0% lower odds of 
major depressive disorder per interquartile increment in Normalised Difference Vegetation Index greenness 
(odds ratio 0·960, 95% CI 0·93–0·99; p=0·0044). Interaction analyses indicated that the beneficial effects of 
greenness were more pronounced among women, participants younger than 60 years, and participants residing in 
areas with low neighbourhood socioeconomic status or high urbanicity.
Interpretation The results point to the benefits of well designed green environments on mental health. Further 
longitudinal studies are needed to decipher causal pathways. In the UK, policies aimed at optimising allocation and 
design of green spaces might help preserve psychological ecosystem services, thereby, improving the mental wellbeing 
of populations and enhancing the mental capital of cities.

Introduction
Given the present unprecedented rate of urbanisation, 
about 60% of the global population are predicted to 
reside in cities by 2030, with one in every three people 
living in cities with at least half a million inhabitants.1 
Typically, cities are characterised by highly dense, 
impervious, built-up spaces and a scarcity of natural 
environments, with the associated potential effects on 
mental health. Dynamic stress vulnerability models 
have reported links between reduced exposure to 
green environments and enhanced vulnerability to the 
negative health effects of stressful life events, which can 
result in increments in the proportion of the population 
with mental disorders and an overall reduction in 
the mental capital of cities.2–4 In recent years, mental 
disorders, including mood disorders, have emerged as a 
leading cause of global disease burden. They also act as 
risk factors for the development of communicable 
and non-communicable diseases, and contribute to 
accidental and non-accidental injuries.5–7 The UK’s total 
annual expenditure on brain disorders was estimated 
to be ap 
proximately €134 billion in 2010, of which 
€19·24 billion was incurred on mood disorders, 
accounting for approx 
imately 3·9 million annual cases 
or 8·73% of all brain disorders.8
The causes of mental health disorders are complex, with 
a long latency between exposures and subsequent 
incidence and progression. A systems-based life course 
approach towards enhancing the mental capital of cities 
and wellbeing of their populations has been proposed.9

The importance of such a holistic approach has been 
emphasised by the inclusion of mental health within the 
Sustainable Development Goals.10,11 Relatedly, exposure to 
residential green environment has also been regarded as 
an effective upstream-level urban intervention with an aim 
to reduce the public health burden of mental disorders.12
Some studies report a beneficial effect of contact with 
green environments on health, in general,13–15 and more 
specifically, with regard to stress, mood, and mental 
health.16,17 Several studies have established a protective 
independent association between various indicators of 
mental health and the percentage of green space within a 
residential neighbourhood,18–21 the amount of tree cover 
in an urban area,22 and the overall exposure of individuals 
to salutogenic green environments.23–25 These protective 
effects of residential green spaces have been explained in 
terms of four mechanisms related to their specific 
functional roles: restorative, stress-relieving spaces;4,26–28 
supportive, social interaction spaces that promote a 
sense of community;29 active living spaces that facilitate 
physical activity;30–32 and natural filters that ameliorate the 
adverse effects of air, noise, and thermal pollution.33–35
Despite the substantial body of evidence, the links 
between residential green exposure and mental health still 
remain far from conclusive in adults.17 Many of the studies 
have used coarse measures of green exposure, expressed 
as a proportion of greenness based on land cover maps 
within a specific catchment or census geography, thereby 
neglecting to include private gardens, street trees, and 
green spaces that do not meet a specific criterion, such as 
a size threshold, and hindering the study’s replicability 
and comparability. A few studies have used the Normalised 
Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), an index of greenery 
derived from Landsat satellite data, as an overall measure 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched online databases, including PubMed, MEDLINE, 
EBSCO, Scopus, and Google/Google Scholar databases, for 
studies and reports published in English between Jan 1, 1984, 
and Feb 10, 2018, using a combination of search terms, 
including “residential greenness”, “green space”, “NDVI”, or 
“built environment”, and “mental health”, “depression”, or 
“major depressive disorder”.
Mental health disorders have emerged as a leading cause of the 
global burden of disease. At the same time, the present 
unprecedented pace of urbanisation and an increasing proportion 
of impervious built-up spaces in our cities have resulted in 
reduced exposures to salutogenic green environments. Several 
studies have examined the links between exposure to green 
environments and mental health, with most studies suggesting 
beneficial effects. Green exposure has been measured in terms of 
access to green spaces (proportion of green spaces within a 
residential neighbourhood) as well as the general salutogenic 
potential of green environments. The protective effects of 
residential green have been hypothesised to originate from one 
or more of its functional roles: as restorative stress-relieving 
spaces; supportive social interaction spaces promoting a sense of 
community; active living spaces facilitating physical activity; and 
natural filters ameliorating the adverse effects of negative 
exposures such as air, noise, and thermal pollution.
Notwithstanding the evidence generated so far, the links 
between residential green exposure and mental health still 
remain equivocal in adults. Many of the studies linking 
residential green exposure with mental health have used coarse 
measures of green exposure, whereas a few studies have used 
the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index as an index of 
salutogenic green, although of low-to-moderate spatial 
resolution. Most studies so far have been small scale and done 
in homogeneous environmental settings, resulting in limited 
statistical power and generalisability.
Added value of this study
The present study is the first of its kind to use the UK Biobank 
data to investigate links between green exposure and mental 
health. The study used a large and diverse analytical sample 
across ten UK cities of 94 879 middle-aged and older adults, a 
crucial life stage for the onset and progression of incipient 
mental disorders. A large spatially diverse sample also enabled 
sufficient statistical power for the examination of 
interactions. The study used structured and validated 
diagnostic criteria to assess lifetime probable major 
depressive disorders and was able to comprehensively adjust 
for sources of confounding. To our knowledge, this is the 
first mental health-related study to use a very high-resolution 
metric of residential greenness (0·5 m resolution index of 
salutogenic green derived from colour infrared imageries) 
that is adjusted for other objectively measured physical 
environment exposures, which are all measured within 
functional catchments of participants’ dwellings.
The study consistently found a protective association between 
greenness and lifetime depression status, reporting a 4% lower 
odds of major depressive disorder with every interquartile 
increment in residential greenness after adjusting for all other 
factors. The beneficial effects of greenness were more 
pronounced among women, participants younger than 
60 years, and participants residing in areas with low 
neighbourhood socioeconomic status or high urbanicity.
Implications of all the available evidence
The results of our study point to the protective effects of well 
designed green environments on mental health. These 
findings have notable policy implications with respect to 
optimising allocation and design of green spaces to preserve 
psychological ecosystem services and thereby improve the 
mental wellbeing of a population and enhance the mental 
capital of cities.

of green exposure (although at a low-to-moderate 
resolution). Most studies so far have been small scale and 
done in homogeneous environmental settings, resulting 
in 
limited 
statistical 
power 
and 
generalisability. 
Furthermore, most studies do not adjust for other aspects 
of activity-influencing built environment and individual-
level confounding effects, or consider interaction effects.
The present study analyses a UK-wide population health 
dataset of unprecedented size and diversity for greenspace 
mental health research. It uses highly characterised 
metrics of green exposure to investigate cross-sectional 
asso 
ciations between residential greenness and major 
depressive disorders, after adjusting for pertinent built 
environment (ie, walkability, terrain, and air pollution) 
and individual confounders. Because exposure to 
greenness and its relation to health is often stratified by 
underlying factors such as socioeconomic status and 
urbanicity,18,36,37 this study also did analyses stratified 
by age, sex, neighbourhood socioeconomic status, and 
urbanicity, and analysed their interactions.
Methods
Analytical sample
This cross-sectional, observational, associational study 
analysed the UK Biobank baseline data on health and 
environment exposures. The National Health Service 
Register randomly sent out around 9·2 million invitation 
letters to potential participants who resided within a 
25 mile radius of a UK Biobank collection centre, each of 
which are located in 22 cities across the UK. 502 649 adult 
participants aged 37–73 years were eventually recruited in 
the UK Biobank study, achieving a response rate of 
5·5%.38,39 The participants provided electronically signed 
consent. The range and scale of the UK Biobank study 
enables accumulation of an adequate number of cases of 
particular diseases within a reasonable follow-up period for 
clinically reliable effect detection. The baseline examination 
collected a wide range of information, including infor-
mation on sociodemographics, lifestyle, and medical 
history through a series of touch-screen questionnaires; 
anthro 
pometric 
measurements; 
biological 
sampling 
(blood, urine, and saliva); and imaging, and involved 
linkage with hospital-related outcomes. Individual-level, 
health-influencing, environment exposures were modelled 
within functional neighbourhoods for each participant.
The mental health component of the UK Biobank was an 
enhancement to the baseline data collection, and questions 
on depressive symptoms were added to the assessment 
protocol during the last 2 years of recruit 
ment. These 
psychological inventories were available to participants 
who visited the remaining ten collection centres in the 
last 2 years of the baseline phase and fulfilled the diagnostic 
criteria of mood disorder.38 The analytical sample excluded 
participants who subsequently dropped out or who did not 
meet the diagnostic criteria for a mood disorder. We also 
excluded from the analyses participants with missing data 
on residential green exposure and other individual 
confounders. The participants of our analytical sample 
attended the assessment centres between April 29, 2009, 
and Oct 1, 2010.
UK Biobank received ethical approvals from the 
North West Multi-centre Research Ethics Committee, the 
Community Health Index Advisory Group, the Patient 
Information Advisory Group, and the National Health 
Service National Research Ethics Service. The detailed 
cohort protocol, scientific rationale, and study design are 
described elsewhere.
Measurement of major depressive disorder
Depression was defined as per UK Biobank’s assessment 
protocol for lifetime experience of probable major 
depressive disorder. The classification and definition of 
lifetime history of mood disorders in UK Biobank was 
based on structured and validated diagnostic criteria 
reported previously.40,41 Briefly, the assessment of major 
depressive disorder comprised items relating to lifetime 
experience of minor or major depression, items from 
the Patient Health Questionnaire, and items related to 
social support for mental health.40,42 As such, the binary 
outcome variable comprised participants with no lifetime 
experience of major depressive disorder (0 or “no case”) 
and participants who had experienced a major depressive 
disorder (1 or “case”). The criteria for participants who 
had experienced a major depressive disorder included 
those who had experienced a single probable lifetime 
episode of major depression, probable recurrent major 
depression (moderate), or probable recurrent major 
depression (severe), or any combination thereof (panel).
Measurement of residential environment exposures
Residential environment exposure data were derived 
from the UK Biobank Urban Morphometric Platform 
(UKBUMP). UKBUMP is a high-resolution spatial 
database of health-influencing environment exposures 
modelled within multiscale residential neighbourhoods 
of each UK Biobank participant’s geocoded dwelling. 
Environmental exposure metrics were developed through 
spatial and network analyses of data from multiple 
UK-wide spatial databases, resulting in multiple exposure 
variables related to greenness, urban density, destination 
accessibility, street-level accessibility, terrain, and depr 
iv-
ation.43,44 Briefly, UKBUMP was developed by geocoding 
participants’ dwelling addresses to the level of building 
footprints, delineating multiscale dwelling neighbour-
hoods by defining street network buffers centred on the 
geocoded dwelling locations in ArcGIS12 Network Analyst, 
and measuring environmental exposures within these 
functional neighbourhoods. After linking the exposure 
metrics to the participants’ dwelling locations, the data 
were reanonymised. Accurate data on building-level land 
uses and street networks were sourced from UK Ordnance 
Survey AddressBase Premium and MasterMap Integrated 
Transport Network databases, whereas residential green-
ness was modelled from high-resolution (50 × 50 cm²)

Residential greenness
Residential exposure to salutogenic green environment 
was measured in terms of mean NDVI within a 
500 m catchment radius of geocoded UK Biobank 
participants’ dwellings. NDVI is a unit-less index of 
relative overall vegetation density and quality, and is 
derived from differential surface reflectance in the red and 
near infrared regions,45 which is measured with a remote 
sensing device. Chlorophyll in healthy vegetation absorbs 
radiation in the visible red region (630–690 nm) of the 
electromagnetic spectrum and reflects radiation in the 
near-infrared region (760–900 nm). This differential in the 
absorbance and reflectance of wavelengths by chlorophyll 
is used as a proxy for green quality and intensity. 
The differential is measured using the following formula:
The formula includes the spectral reflectance measure-
ments acquired in the visible (RED) and near-infrared 
regions (NIR) of the electromagnetic spectrum. Index 
scores range between –1 and 1, with higher values 
indicating higher densities of green vegetation.
In the present study, NDVI greenness was derived 
from a series of 0·5 m resolution, colour-infrared 
imagery collected by Bluesky (Ashby-De-La-Zouch, UK) 
with the help of specially developed sensors mounted 
underneath a survey aircraft. Summer-time images of 
the study areas collected over similar temporal scales 
(across the baseline phase of the UK Biobank study) were 
stitched together to avoid temporal mismatch. After 
excluding large water bodies, we modelled mean NDVI 
within a 500 m residential buffer of each UK Biobank 
participant. Selection of a 500 m catchment area for 
measuring residential green exposures was based on our 
previous studies46,47 and on other previous reports48,49 that 
used a quarter mile (400–500 m) neighbourhood for 
measuring NDVI greenness.
Physical environment
Among the physical environment exposures, terrain was 
modelled in ArcGIS12 Spatial Analyst from a 5 m resolution 
Bluesky digital terrain model and expressed as variability 
(SD) of slope, in degrees, within a 0·5 km residential 
catchment of UK Biobank participants’ dwellings. As such, 
the metric is able to differentiate between flat and hilly 
surface within the residential catchment.
Exposure to PM2·5 obtained from UK Biobank’s linked 
air pollution exposure data was used as a proxy for 
traffic-related air pollution. The measurement was based 
on monitoring on three occasions over a 14 day period 
during the cold, warm, and intermediate seasons of the 
year. Individual annual exposure to particulate matter 
concentrations around geocoded residential addresses 
was derived from land-use regression models.50
Built environment
Built-environment 
metrics 
from 
UKBUMP 
were 
assessed within a 1 km street catchment of participants’ 
dwellings. Street-level movement density was modelled 
in terms of through-movement potential of the street 
segments, also termed as betweenness centrality in 
graph theoretic terminology. The method has been used 
in active living research and described elsewhere.51,52 The 
UK-wide street network data for the study area comprised 
approximately 4 million street segments, which were 
extracted from the OS MasterMap Integrated Transport 
Network database, transcribed into an access graph 
model, and subjected to network analysis in sDNA53 to 
model street-level movement density. Movement density 
is expressed as the simulated counts of movement 
through each link in the network, given its relative 
position and topological connectivity with other 
segments within the network. The measure also acts as a 
proxy for relative accessibility and centrality of a place. 
Betweenness centrality of x in a graph of N links might 
be defined as:

In the formula, y and z are the geodesic endpoints; Ry is 
the set of links within a defined neighbourhood 
catchment from y; L(y) is the length of link y and L(z) is 
the length of link z; and P(z) is the proportion of link 
z within the defined radius.
The origin-destination function (OD) is defined as: 
An objective index of urbanicity within a 1 km residential 
catchment was developed from the UKBUMP built-
environment variables to investigate associations between 
residential greenness and major depressive disorder, 
stratified by urbanicity quartiles. Urbanicity was defined 
as: 
The formula includes the density of residential housing 
(resid), retail (retail), and public transport (PT) in units 
per km² street catchment, in addition to street-level 
movement density (street movement).
Individual-level covariates
On the basis of previous scientific literature, the study 
adjusted for demographic covariates (age, sex, highest 
educational qualification, and employment status), 
smoking status, and prevalent comorbidities (body-mass 
index [BMI] status, doctor-diagnosed cardiometabolic 
disease, and diabetes).
Socioeconomic status was assessed at household and 
neighbourhood levels in terms of mean annual 
household income before tax and Townsend deprivation 
index scores,54 which is a composite index of four 
postcode-level socioeconomic status variables (household 
overcrowding, unemployment, non-home ownership, 
and non-car ownership), with a higher score indicative of 
lower neighbourhood socioeconomic status.
We used participation in leisure and social activities 
as a proxy for social interaction and support. Level of 
participation was based on response to the questionnaire: 
“Which of the following do you attend once a week or 
more often? (You can select more than one)”; with 
available responses being none; pub or social club; 
religious group; sports club or gym; and adult education 
class or other group activity. Responses were converted 
into a six-factor variable: none, pub or social club, 
religious group, sports club or gym, adult education class 
and other, and combination of two or more activities.
Statistical analyses
The prevalence of lifetime experience of probable major 
depressive disorder was modelled as a two factor variable 
(case or non-case) as per UK Biobank’s assessment 
protocol. Age was coded as a three-factor variable 
(38–50 years, 51–60 years, or 61–73 years) and sex as a 
two-factor variable (female or male). Highest educational 
attainment was defined as a five-factor variable (none; 
O levels, GCSEs, or CSEs; A levels or AS levels; NVQ, 
HND, HNC, or other professional qualification; or 
college or university degree) and employment as a 
three-factor variable (employed; retired; or unemployed, 
home maker, or other). Mean annual household 
in 
come before tax was expressed as a four-factor 
variable (<£18 000, £18 000–£30 999, £31 000–£51 999, or 
≥£52 000). The household income data were available for 
82 839 participants in the analytical sample. Townsend 
scores were categorised into quintiles and used as a 
five-factor variable. Smoking status was coded as non-
smoker, previous smoker, and current smoker. Doctor-
diagnosed cardiometabolic disease was transformed into 
a four-factor variable (none; high blood pressure; heart 
attack, angina, or stroke; or both high blood pressure and 
heart attack, angina, or stroke) and diabetes was coded as 
a two-factor variables (yes or no). Measured BMI status 
was expressed as a three-factor variable (<25 kg/m²; 
≥25 kg/m² and <30 kg/m²; or ≥30 kg/m²). Terrain 
variability and walkability (expressed as movement 
density) were transformed into quartiles.
The study followed a multi-layered analyses strategy. 
Logistic regression models investigated the association 
between residential greenness and odds of major 
depressive disorder. Odds ratios (OR) and two-tailed 
95% CIs estimated by bootstrapping have been presented 
for each IQR increment in NDVI. In model 1, we 
modelled initial crude estimates adjusted for age. 
Model 2 further adjusted for sex, educational qualifi-
cation, employment status, smoking status, prevalent 
obesity, cardiometabolic disease, and diabetes status; 
model 3 additionally adjusted for physical and built 
environment variables of terrain, exposure to fine 
particulates, and activity-influencing movement density; 
and model 4 additionally adjusted for household and 
neighbourhood socioeconomic status and leisure and 
social activity. Multicollinearity among predictor variables 
was assessed through Pearson’s correlation coefficients 
and variance inflation factors to ensure parsimonious fit.
Stratified analyses were done by age, sex, urbanicity, 
and neighbourhood socioeconomic status to investigate 
potential changes in point estimates and level of 
significance across each stratum. As a further step, the 
study analysed the interaction effects of age and 
urbanicity, sex and urbanicity, age and neighbourhood 
socioeconomic status, and sex and neighbourhood 
socioeconomic status on the relation between residential 
greenness and prevalence of major depressive disorder.
All analyses were done in statistical software Stata 14.

Role of the funding source
The funders and UK Biobank participants did not 
participate in developing the research questions, 
outcome measures, and environmental measures of the 
present study. They had no role in study design, 
modelling, data collection, data analysis, data inter-
pretation, or writing of the report. CS, CW, and JG had 
full access to all the data in the study and had final 
responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.
Results
172 751 participants visited the remaining ten UK Biobank 
collection centres in the last 2 years of the baseline phase 
and completed the mental health component of the UK 
Biobank assessment protocol. After excluding participants 
who subsequently dropped out and participants who 
did not meet the diagnostic criteria for a mood disorder, 
valid data were available for 122 993 participants. After 
excluding missing data on residential green exposure 
for 23 945 (19·5%) participants and other individual con-
founders for 4169 (3·4%) participants, an analytical sample 
of 94 879 (77·1%) participants was available for analyses.
The analytical sample remained representative of the 
full UK Biobank cohort (table 1; appendix). Overall, 
24 348 (25·7%) patients in the sample had major 
depressive disorders. In all our models, the Pearson’s 
correlation coefficients remained less than 0·23 and the 
variance inflation factors remained less than 1·08, 
indicating low levels of collinearity.
Exposure to residential greenness remained signifi-
cantly associated with major depressive disorder, with 
4·0–4·9% lower odds of major depressive disorder 
reported across models 1–4 (table 2). Adjusting for 
individual-level covariates, physical and built environment 
variables (model 3), an interquartile increment in NDVI 
greenness within a 500 m catchment was associated with 
4·3% lower odds of major depressive disorder (OR 0·957, 
95% CI 0·93–0·98; p=0·0008; table 2; see appendix for 
full table). After further adjustments for socioeconomic 
status and social activities (in the fully adjusted model 4), 
an interquartile increment in NDVI was associated with 
4·0% lower odds of major depressive disorder (OR 0·960, 
0·93–0·99; p=0·0044; table 2).
Among the other significant environment exposure 
variables in our fully adjusted model 4, terrain variability 
(ie, more hilly terrain) was associated with higher odds of 
major depressive disorder, with the third (p=0·026) and 
fourth (p<0·0001) quartiles of terrain variability having 
higher odds of major depressive disorder than the first 
quartile. Street-level movement density, measured as 
betweenness centrality, was associated with lower odds of 
major depressive disorder, with the second (p=0·013) and 
third (p=0·0030) quartiles (ie, areas of greater street-level 
movement density) having lower odds of major depressive 
disorder than the first quartile. Higher mean annual 
household income was consistently associated with lower 
odds of major depressive disorder (p<0·0001 for those

earning £18 000–£30 999, p<0·0001 for those earning 
£31 000–£51 999, and p<0·0001 for those earning 
≥£52 000, in reference to the lower income group earning 
<£18 000). Lower neighbourhood socio 
economic status 
(expressed in terms of Townsend’s deprivation score) was 
associated with higher odds of major depressive disorder, 
with the results being significant for the fifth quintile 
only (p=0·048 in reference to the first quintile). In 
reference to participants not engaged in any social 
activities, participants attending pubs or participating in 
social club-based activities (p<0·0001), engaging in 
religious group activities (p<0·0001), and attending a 
sports club or gym (p<0·0001) reported significantly 
lower odds of major depressive disorder.
Rerunning the analysis with the residential greenness 
as a factor variable categorised into quartiles indicated 
a beneficial effect for the third (OR 0·933, 95% CI 
0·89–0·98; p=0·0029) and fourth (OR 0·947, 0·90–0·99; 
p=0·023) quartiles but not the second quartile (OR 1·039, 
0·99–1·09; p=0·090) in reference to the first quartile and 
subsequent to all adjustments.
In the stratified models (figure 1), the association 
between residential greenness and odds of major 
depressive disorder remained significant only in female 
participants (OR 0·96, 95% CI 0·92–0·99; p=0·022); 
participants younger than 60 years (OR 0·96, 0·92–0·99; 
p=0·017); participants in the third (OR 0·92, 0·87–0·98; 
p=0·0085) and fourth (OR 0·91, 0·85–0·97; p=0·0070) 
urbanicity quartiles; and participants in the lower 
neighbourhood socioeconomic status quintiles, namely 
the fourth (OR 0·89, 0·83–0·96; p=0·0037) and fifth 
(0·85, 0·78–0·93; p=0·0003) quintiles of the Townsend 
index.
Consistent with the results of the stratified analyses, 
interactions between age and urbanicity and between sex 
and urbanicity found a slightly stronger protective 
association of residential greenness on major depressive 
disorder for women and participants younger than 
60 years, with the effects being significant only in urban 
areas (ie, the third and fourth urbanicity quartiles; 
figure 2). Similarly, interaction models of age and 
neighbourhood socioeconomic status and of sex and 
neighbourhood socioeconomic status reported slightly 
stronger protective effects in women and participants 
younger than 60 years, with the effects being significant 
among lower neighbourhood socioeconomic status 
groups (ie, the fourth and fifth quintiles of the Townsend 
index; figure 2).
Discussion
In this large, UK-wide, cross-sectional study, residential 
greenness was consistently associated with lower odds 
of depression, with the results remaining robust to 
adjustments for other physical, built, and social 
environment variables. This is one of the largest studies 
to use very high-resolution metrics of residential 
greenness (0·5 m on the ground measured from an 
aircraft) and to have adjusted for other objectively 
measured physical environment exposures.
This study reported a protective association of 
greenness on lifetime depression status, with effect sizes 
being moderate at 4% lower odds of major depressive 
disorder with every interquartile increment in residential 
greenness after adjusting for all other factors. This 
finding lends support to previous studies reporting 
protective effects of residential green exposure on 
depression.18–21,23,24 One large-scale study19 has reported 
that having 10% more greenness than average within 1 km

was associated with 4% lower odds of depression, and 
within 3 km was associated with 2% lower odds of 
depression. A US study23 involving 2479 residents of 
Wisconsin reported that a 25% increment in NDVI 
greenness was associated with a 1·4 unit reduction in a 
depression anxiety and stress scale. Another study24 of 
8793 participants in Catalonia, Spain, reported that 
each interquartile increment in NDVI greenness was 
associated with a 21% lower perceived risk of poor 
mental health and a 19% lower risk of perceived 
depression or anxiety. In both the later studies,23,24 NDVI 
greenness was derived from 30 m resolution Landsat 
satellite data and our study improves on these findings 
in terms of both spatial accuracy and confounders.
Green spaces and wellbeing are intrinsically linked.55 
The observed overall protective effects of residential 
green on depression status might be interpreted in terms 
of mechanisms oriented around biology, physiology, 
and lifestyle. The biophilia hypothesis suggests that 
biologically, human beings have an innate affinity 
towards natural environments, life forms, and life-like 
processes as a consequence of evolution and natural 
selection, and such environments are inherently 
associated with lower stress levels than more urban 
environments.15,56 According to the stress reduction 
hypothesis, residential green can provide restorative 
stress-relieving environments that are capable of 
instilling a positive psychological state.26–28,57 Green 
environments might also provide stimuli for attention 
restoration and associated cognitive benefits.58,59 At a 
physiological level, evidence has been established for 
beneficial, stress-relieving effects of green exposure in 
urban settings, assessed through biological markers, 
including salivary cortisol,60 amylase,61 telomere length,62 
and improved cardiometabolic health.63 At a neuro-
biological level, rumination and associated neural activity 
in the subgenual prefrontal cortex have been linked to 
elevated levels of depression and psychological dis-
orders.64 The place-cells within the hippocampus also 
help encode attributes of real-world places, enabling the 
formation of cognitive maps of places, which again 
affects an individual’s sense of attachment and route 
choice.65 A 2015 study66 reported that a 90 min walk in 
a green environment decreases both self-reported 
rumination and subgenual prefrontal cortex activity, 
whereas the same duration of walk in an urban setting 
had no effect. Rumination is a maladaptive attentional 
focus and has been linked to onset of depressive episodes 
and mental disorders. Neurological evidence has shown 
that the subgenual prefrontal cortex in the brain is 
particularly active during rumination. At a lifestyle level, 
residential greenness provides spaces for people to 
interact and support one another and facilitates a positive 
perception of neighbourhood and sense of community.29,67 
Further 
more, green spaces act as activity spaces, 
facilitating participation in physical and social activi-
ties.31,68 The protective effects69 of physical activity on 
depression can plausibly be attributed to elevated levels 
of brain neurotransmitters, such as monoamines and 
endorphins, and to enhanced self-esteem.70
Unlike previous reports, our study also adjusted for 
activity-influencing environment metrics. As per pre-
vious findings,71 terrain variability was associated with 
higher odds of major depressive disorder. Terrain 
variability acts as a proxy for the degree of impediments 
to physical mobility, with its negative association with 
major depressive disorder possibly attributable to the 
effects of reduced functional capacity among participants 
residing in variable terrain. Furthermore, in a varied 
terrain, people might not be able to make as much use of 
available green spaces. Built environment metrics of 
density and form capture variations in the con 
figuration 
of urban spaces in a city and these might directly affect 
mental health independently of green effects. In addition 
to green exposure, an optimised neighbourhood design 
might act as buffers against stressful environments. 
A 2018 study72 reported more pronounced beneficial 
effects of walkability on hypertension in the high-green 
quartiles than in the low-green quartiles. Built-
environment design and confi 
guration determines 
accessibility to green spaces and, as such, actual usage

and levels of physical activity. In the present study, street-
level movement density, captured by the index of 
betweenness centrality, was consistently associated with 
reduced odds of major depressive disorder. This finding 
points to the protective effects of well designed and 
connected neighbourhoods and greater activity and 
walking,46 
and 
hence, 
improved 
mental 
health.71 
Furthermore, a walkable, well designed community is 
associated with increased neighbourhood cohesion and 
social support. The beneficial effects of participation in 
leisure and social activities on major depressive disorder 
might point to the community social capital-based 
mechanism.73 Corroborating previous studies,18,37 this 
study reported that higher socioeconomic deprivation, 
measured by Townsend’s score, was associated with 
higher odds of major depressive disorder.
In the subgroup analyses, the significant beneficial 
effects of residential green on major depressive disorders 
in women is attributable to increased daily exposure to 
functional neighbourhood environment and corresponds 
with previous findings.18,24,74 The reduced effects in 
participants aged older than 60 years might be related to 
the reduced functional capacity in these population 
clusters.75 The significantly higher protective effects of 
residential greenness reported in low neighbourhood 
socioeconomic status and high urbanicity groups than 
reported in their opposite counterparts has been 
reported previously.18,37,76 The pronounced protective 
effects reported in the deprived and high urbanicity areas 
might originate from the restorative potential of green 
environments in exposure subgroups, which are 
generally associated with increased levels of stress.77 
Furthermore, in this study, urbanicity is a composite 
index of density, which is synonymous with compactness. 
The protective effects of green allocated in these areas 
stem from an increased density of exposed population, 
an increased degree of accessibility, and potentially 
increased usage.

The results of this study have important implications 
for public health and urban policies. Of specific interest 
is the use of green exposures as an upstream-level 
intervention to manage and minimise the burden of 
mental health disorders. Our findings will support public 
health and urban planning professionals in arguing for 
optimisation of residential green space exposure and 
related built environment attributes, in terms of allocation 
(size and shape), quality, density, and accessibility, with 
an aim to improve psychological ecosystem services78 to 
yield benefits for individuals’ mental health. Our findings 
also give guidance for more targeted interventions; 
in addition to urban environmental stressors, the 
characteristics of the resident population, especially their 
intrinsic sociodemographic and vulnerability profiles, 
need to be considered.
The study has several strengths. It used a high-quality, 
UK Biobank cohort dataset of unprecedented size and 
with substantial population-level and spatial diversity. 
Such a large analytical sample also meant the study had 
sufficient statistical power to investigate interactions. 
The study used clinically meaningful and validated 
instruments to define lifetime prevalence of major 
depressive disorders.40 It also used highly characterised 
metrics of residential greenness and physical and built 
environment that were measured within neighbourhoods 
of an individual’s dwelling. The NDVI has been 
previously validated as a measure of greenness in 
epidemiological research.79 In the present study, it acted 
as an objective measure of green exposure (both density 
and quality) and as a proxy for capturing the intangible 
salutogenic potential within a residential environment. 
The use of very high resolution (50 × 50 cm²) colour 
infrared data captured during aerial photography with 
the Vexcel UltraCamD and the Leica ADS4 enabled 
extreme precision in green measurements. Previous 
studies have used conventional satellite remote-sensing 
data, for which the quality is often limited by low 
resolution, cloud cover, and atmospheric distortions.46 
In view of the established links between active living and 
depression,69 the study also adjusted for other influencing 
environment features, which it operationalised through 
objective measures of terrain variability, street-level 
walkability, and exposure to fine particulate matter, 
in addition to adjusting for socioeconomic status, social 
activities, and other individual-level confounders.
This study also has some limitations. A cross-sectional 
study design limits confidence in the establishment of 
causal associations. Depressed participants might have 
migrated to greener areas and the resulting self-selection 
could potentially lead to underestimation of the effects of 
greenness on major depressive disorder. The study did 
not have data on the spatial mobility of participants over 
the baseline phase (2006–10) or on changes in exposures 
owing to migration from one address to another. 
Nonetheless, the mean duration of residence across the 
non-major depressive disorder and major depressive 
disorder groups was similar at 18 years and 16 years, 
respectively, and the introduction of duration of residence 
in the fully adjusted model did not produce any material 
effects on the point estimates and level of significance. 
As repeat-assessment data from the UK Biobank 
subsample become available, future studies should 
investigate the longitudinal associations of green 
exposure with major depressive disorder. The major 
depressive disorder outcome, being derived from a 
self-reported instrument, is prone to recall bias, leading 
to potential under-reporting of mood symptoms, 
especially severe depres 
sive disorders.80 Represen-
tativeness is another factor; individuals with a lifetime 
history of psychiatric disorders might have been less 
likely to participate in the UK Biobank study, potentially 
limiting the generalisability of the findings. Never 
theless, 
in view of the large sample size, diverse population 
characteristics, and heterogeneity in the environmental 
exposures, the effects on generalisability of the reported 
findings would have been minimal. The reported ORs of 
major depressive disorder might be further affected by 
finer design parameters of public green spaces, including 
size, shape, degree of landscaping, park facilities, and 
recreational pro 
grammes, which our study could not 
adjust for. Although the study included objectively 
measured metrics of resi 
dential green and physical 
environment, it could not individually adjust for 
perceptions of neighbourhood environment, including 
proxies of aesthetics and safety, which might influence 
usage of public green space.81
With rapid urbanisation and progressive urban 
densification, optimisation of individual-level exposures 
to green can be one of the most enduring public health 
interventions achieved by urban design and planning. 
Adding to previous evidence, our large-scale study con-
cludes that exposure to green environments in an urban 
setting is associated with accrued psychological benefits 
in the form of reduced odds of major depressive 
disorders. 
This 
has 
substantial 
public 
health 
implications. As an upstream-level intervention, green 
environments, when optimally allocated, designed, and 
configured in relation to the existing matrix of land uses 
and the characteristics of the resident population, have 
the potential to enhance psychological ecosystem 
services and, subsequently, enhance the mental capital 
of cities.
