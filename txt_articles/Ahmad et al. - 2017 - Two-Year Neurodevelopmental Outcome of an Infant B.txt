 Over time, advances in neonatal care 
have led to a gradual lowering in the 
gestational limits of survivability.‍1 
Recent literature confirms that, at the 
lower limit of extrauterine survival, 
substantial intercenter variability 
exists in resuscitation practices.‍2 
For infants delivered at 22 to 23 
weeks’ gestation, the variability in 
active treatment policies at delivery 
accounts for 75% of the variation in 
survival without severe impairment.‍2 
Further, of infants born at 22 weeks 
who received active intervention, 
23% survived and two-thirds of 
survivors did not have severe 
neurodevelopmental impairment.‍2
The reasons for the wide variability  
in management practices are not 
entirely clear.‍ Recent survey data 
suggest that US neonatologists split 
evenly between viewing the best 
interests standard as considering  
only the infant’s well-being versus 
viewing the interests of the infant  
and the family being inextricably 
linked because negative effects on 
the family in turn are harmful to the 
infant.‍3 This appears to be a shift 
in comparison with survey data 
from almost 30 years ago4 when 
neonatologists largely agreed that 
parental wishes would influence their 
decision-making.‍

Recent literature confirms that, at the lower limit of extrauterine survival, 
substantial intercenter variability exists in resuscitation practice.‍ The 
reasons for this variability are unclear, but may be related to disagreement 
on how to apply the best interests standard to extremely premature 
infants.‍ Currently, both obstetric and pediatric societies recommend 
against assessing for viability or attempting resuscitation before 22 weeks’ 
gestation.‍ In this context, we report the unimpaired 2-year outcome of a 
female infant resuscitated after delivery at 21 weeks’ 4 days’ gestation 
and 410 g birth weight.‍ She may be the most premature known survivor to 
date.‍ This infant had multiple risk factors for adverse outcome, including 
prolonged mechanical ventilation, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and 
threshold retinopathy of prematurity.‍ She achieved discharge from the 
hospital on low-flow oxygen at 39 weeks’ 4 days’ gestation and 2519 g.‍ At 
24 months’ and 8 days’ chronological age, she achieved cognitive, motor, 
and language Bayley III scores of 90, 89, and 88, equivalent to 105, 100, and 
103 at 20 months 2 days corrected age.‍ It is known that active intervention 
policies at 22 weeks’ gestation improves the outcome for those infants 
and it may be reasonable to infer that these benefits would extend, if to a 
lesser degree, into the 21st week.‍ Ultimately, such limited data exist at this 
gestational age that the time may have arrived for obstetrical centers to 
begin systematically reporting fetal outcomes in the 21st week.‍

 Currently, both obstetric and 
pediatric societies recommend 
against assessing for viability or 
attempting resuscitation before 22 
weeks’ gestation.‍5, 
 
6 Further, we are 
unware of any hospitals with a policy 
for active resuscitation in the 21st 
week.‍ This has resulted in a dearth 
of data examining the outcomes of 
infants born alive within the 21st 
week.‍ In this context, we report the 
outcome of a female infant born at 
21 weeks’ 4 days’ gestation whom 
we believe to be the most premature 
survivor reported.‍7 She is now 2 
years old.‍
CASE REPORT
This infant was born in San Antonio, 
TX, in 2014 to a 32-year-old 
Gravida6Para1Abortus4 mother 
with early, regular prenatal care.‍ 
We ascertained maturity by last 
menstrual period dating of 21 weeks 
4 days, consistent with 9-week 
ultrasound dating of 21 weeks 2 days.‍ 
The mother presented with preterm 
premature rupture of membranes 
for 80 hours, preterm labor, and 
chorioamnionitis.‍ The infant 
was delivered through purulent 
amniotic fluid and her umbilical cord 
remained unclamped until initiating 
resuscitation 5 minutes after delivery 
at parental request, despite a lack 
of spontaneous activity.‍ Her Apgar 
score was 6 at 10 minutes.‍ Birth 
parameters included weight 410 g, 
head circumference 19 cm, and 
length 26 cm.‍
We initiated enteral feedings 
at 5 days of age with expressed 
breastmilk, after resolution of 
systemic hypotension.‍ After 3 days 
of trophic feeds, the patient tolerated 
gradual increases in expressed 
breastmilk volume.‍ We maintained 
an exclusive breastmilk diet, 
including fortification, for most of her 
hospital stay.‍
Our patient required 56 days of 
mechanical ventilation, including 
31 days of high-frequency jet 
ventilation.‍ Attempted extubation on 
days 3 and 49 failed.‍ After successful 
extubation on day 56, she required 2 
days of nasal prong ventilation and 
47 days of high-flow nasal cannula.‍ 
She received 108 days of systemic 
steroids (15 days of dexamethasone) 
and 93 days of hydrocortisone.‍
Serial echocardiography revealed 
a patent ductus arteriosus 
with a maximal size of 2 mm.‍ 
Management consisted of mild 
long-term fluid restriction of 
130 to 140 mL/kg per day total 
volume without pharmacological 
or surgical interventions.‍ Repeat 
echocardiograms showed the patent 
ductus arteriosus to be small near 
discharge.‍
Bilateral threshold retinopathy of 
prematurity required intraocular 
bevacizumab therapy.‍ Four 
neurosonograms and a 38-week 
brain MRI revealed no detectable 
abnormalities.‍ Discharge support 
at 126 days after birth (39 weeks’ 
4 days’ postmenstrual age) 
included 0.‍25 L per minute of 
oxygen, chlorothiazide, and inhaled 
beclomethasone.‍ At discharge, the 
patient was successfully completing 
all feeds by mouth but undergrown: 
weight 2519 g (third percentile, z 
score −1.‍86), head circumference 31 
cm (first percentile, z score −2.‍51), 
and length 42 cm (<first percentile, z 
score −3.‍50).‍8
At 24 months’ 8 days’ chronological 
age (20 months’ 2 days’ corrected 
age) the growth parameters with 
prematurity-corrected percentiles 
include a weight of 7.‍98 kg (<first 
percentile, z score −3.‍73), head 
circumference 45.‍2 cm (11th 
percentile, z score −1.‍24), and length 
76.‍3 cm (fourth percentile, z score 
−1.‍77).‍ Removing prematurity 
correction provides for a weight 
<first percentile (z score −4.‍53), 
head circumference fifth percentile 
(z score −1.‍62), and length <first 
percentile (z score −2.‍76).‍9 The 
concurrent Bayley III examination 
demonstrated unimpaired 
developmental scores for age 
(Table 1).‍ Further, the patient did 
not develop cerebral palsy, visual 
impairment, or auditory impairment.‍
DISCUSSION
Accurate assignment of gestational 
age has importance for research 
and public health purposes.‍ In this 
case we do not have an assisted 
reproductive technology–derived 
gestational age.‍ However, the 
presence of 9-week ultrasound 
dating only 2 days discrepant 
with last menstrual period dating 
meets criteria for best obstetric

 estimate as outlined in recent 
recommendations.‍10
Many risk factors in this clinical 
vignette have an association with 
adverse neurodevelopmental 
outcomes.‍ Despite these risks, the 
patient had unimpaired 2-year Bayley 
scores.‍ Currently, both obstetric 
and pediatric societies recommend 
against assessing for viability or 
attempting resuscitation before 
22 weeks’ gestation.‍5, 
 
6 Therefore, 
the lack of data on the outcomes of 
infants born during the 21st week 
of gestation is unsurprising.‍ What 
is known is that active intervention 
at 22 weeks’ gestation significantly 
improves the outcome for those 
infants.‍2 It may be reasonable to 
consider that these benefits would 
extend, if to a lesser degree, to the 
21st week.‍ Further, the inconsistent 
application of core terms, such as 
stillbirth, influences clinical decisions 
in a way that adversely affects 
the potential for survival.‍11 At the 
moment we initiated resuscitation, 
this infant would generally have 
been considered stillborn or an 
early postnatal death, had further 
assessment or intervention been 
withheld.‍
The outcome of this case raises 
many ethical questions.‍ This 
intact survival of an infant 
delivered halfway through the 
21st week may be considered 
both by obstetricians evaluating 
their approach to counseling and 
management of pregnancies, as well 
as by neonatologists approaching 
prenatal discussions and delivery 
room management of these patients.‍ 
Clearly, 1 positive data point is 
insufficient to recommend aggressive 
obstetric and neonatal management 
of other 21-week pregnancies.‍ 
However, neither may we ignore 
outcomes data solely because they do 
not fit comfortably into established 
practice.‍ A useful approach to the 
questions raised by this case is to use 
the model established by Chervenak 
and McCullough.‍12 This model 
provides a framework for how to 
balance beneficence- and autonomy-
based obligations to the pregnant 
woman with beneficence-based 
obligations to the fetus, while also 
recognizing the pregnant woman’s 
beneficence-based obligations to her 
fetus.‍
The obstetric team has autonomy-
based obligations to inform the 
pregnant woman of the predicted 
outcomes associated with either 
aggressive or nonaggressive obstetric 
management for her and her fetus 
at 21 weeks.‍ With the aggressive 
medical care provided to this infant, 
we can no longer say that mortality 
is certain at 21 weeks’ gestation, 
though it remains highly probable.‍ 
Similarly, the neonatal team should 
discuss the outcomes associated with 
aggressive neonatal management as 
well as the near certainty of death if 
a palliative care approach is taken.‍ 
This information must be presented 
in a comprehensible manner to fulfill 
the autonomy-based obligation to the 
pregnant woman.‍
For beneficence-based obligations 
toward the fetus to exist, the health 
care team must both consider the 
fetus a patient and there must 
exist medical interventions that 
are reliably expected to result in 
a greater balance of clinical goods 
over harms.‍ However, 2 inherent 
quandaries should be addressed.‍ 
First, defining what is considered 
a clinical “good” versus “harm” 
requires dialogue between the 
medical team and the pregnant 
woman.‍ It must be understood 
that what qualifies as a “good” or 
“harm” for 1 situation may not 
qualify in another, and also that 
parents and clinicians may differ 
on the definitions of these terms.‍13 
Second, we should recognize the 
paucity of reliable data to guide our 
clinical decision-making.‍ Therefore, 
beneficence-based obligations to the 
fetus are weak and likely subordinate 
to the obligations toward the 
pregnant woman.‍
The beneficence-based obligations 
on the part of the pregnant woman 
to her fetus should be similarly 
analyzed.‍ The pregnant woman is 
expected to take reasonable risks to 
her health for the benefit of the fetus, 
including, but not limited to, cesarean 
delivery.‍ However, as with the team’s 
beneficence-based obligations to the 
fetus, the mother’s obligations are 
contingent on a reliable expectation 
of benefit.‍ In the absence of clear 
benefit, the mother’s obligations to 
her fetus are also weak.‍ Therefore, 
any decisions regarding obstetric 
management rest primarily on the 
health care team’s autonomy- and 
beneficience-based obligations to the 
mother.‍
Once the infant is born, health care 
decisions regarding the infant are 
entirely beneficence-based.‍ The 
health care team and the parents 
should engage in shared decision-
making focused on protecting the 
best interests of the infant, including 
the effects on the family, inasmuch 
as these effects in turn harm the 
infant.‍3 Critical in guiding these 
decisions are population-based data 
that reflect the clinical condition 
of the infant and the infant’s 
unique clinical circumstances.‍ The 
implication is that should the infant 
survive resuscitation in the delivery 
room and appear stable in the early 
period, the health care team should 
continue to provide appropriate life-
sustaining care.‍ However, if the infant 
shows signs that life-sustaining care 
is no longer beneficial, the health 
care team should consider quickly 
pivoting toward palliative care.‍
Our management of this patient is 
consistent with this approach.‍ Similar 
to the management approach now 
recommended by the American 
Academy of Pediatrics, 
6 we initially 
counseled the mother against 
resuscitation in the delivery room, 
reflecting a weak beneficence-based 
obligation to the fetus.‍ However, 
on the explicit request of the 
mother, we initiated resuscitation

 of the infant.‍ After showing signs of 
viability, we then proceeded to full 
life-sustaining measures.‍ We felt 
justified in doing so because our 
beneficence-based obligation to the 
infant now tilted toward aggressive 
care due to the infant’s vigorousness 
and the mother’s assessment that 
a trial of intensive care best served 
her infant’s interest.‍ Although our 
patient experienced a prolonged 
hospital course, at no time did our 
continual reassessments of her 
condition change the conclusion that 
continued life-sustaining treatment 
was in her best interests.‍
Recent editorials have emphasized 
that gestational age–based 
resuscitation policies may not 
just reflect known, yet outdated, 
information but may also be 
adversely shaping those outcomes.‍14 
Indeed, it seems clear that outcomes 
at the lowest gestational ages can 
improve only if clinical practice 
continues to evolve.‍14 Given 
the beneficial impact of active 
intervention at 22 weeks2 and this 
report, the time may have arrived 
for obstetric centers to begin 
systematically reporting outcomes 
data for fetuses delivered within the 
21st week of gestation, including the 
rates of liveborn versus stillborn.‍ 
These data are necessary to guide 
adequate decision-making for these 
infants and are currently lacking.‍
