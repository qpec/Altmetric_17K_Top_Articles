IMPORTANCE Although data obtained from regional trauma systems demonstrate improved
outcomes for children treated at pediatric trauma centers (PTCs) compared with those
treated at adult trauma centers (ATCs), differences in mortality have not been consistently
observed for adolescents. Because trauma is the leading cause of death and acquired
disability among adolescents, it is important to better define differences in outcomes
among injured adolescents by using national data.
OBJECTIVES To use a national data set to compare mortality of injured adolescents
treated at ATCs, PTCs, or mixed trauma centers (MTCs) that treat both pediatric and adult
trauma patients and to determine the final discharge disposition of survivors at different
center types.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Data from level I and II trauma centers participating in
the 2010 National Trauma Data Bank (January 1 to December 31, 2010) were used to create
multilevel models accounting for center-specific effects to evaluate the association of center
characteristics (PTC, ATC, or MTC) on mortality among patients aged 15 to 19 years who were
treated for a blunt or penetrating injury. The models controlled for sex; mechanism of injury
(blunt vs penetrating); injuries sustained, based on the Abbreviated Injury Scale scores
(post-dot values <3 or �3 by body region); initial systolic blood pressure; and Glasgow Coma
Scale scores. Missing data were managed using multiple imputation, accounting for multilevel
data structure. Data analysis was conducted from January 15, 2013, to March 15, 2016.
EXPOSURES Type of trauma center.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mortality at each center type.
RESULTS Among 29 613 injured adolescents (mean [SD] age, 17.3 [1.4] years; 72.7% male),
most were treated at ATCs (20 402 [68.9%]), with the remainder at MTCs (7572 [25.6%]) or
PTCs (1639 [5.5%]). Adolescents treated at PTCs were more likely to be injured by a blunt
than penetrating injury mechanism (91.4%) compared with those treated at ATCs (80.4%) or
MTCs (84.6%). Mortality was higher among adolescents treated at ATCs and MTCs than those
treated at PTCs (3.2% and 3.5% vs 0.4%; P < .001). The adjusted odds of mortality were
higher at ATCs (odds ratio, 4.19; 95% CI, 1.30-13.51) and MTCs (odds ratio, 6.68; 95% CI,
2.03-21.99) compared with PTCs but was not different between level I and II centers (odds
ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59-0.99).
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE Mortality among injured adolescents was lower among those
treated at PTCs, compared with those treated at ATCs and MTCs. Defining resource and
patient features that account for these observed differences is needed to optimize
adolescent outcomes after injury.

A
s adolescents transition into adulthood, their medical
care changes from delivery by pediatric to adult health
care professionals. This transition also occurs for ado-
lescents’hospital-based treatment after injury, with more ado-
lescent trauma patients being treated at centers that primar-
ily treat injured adults. Pediatric trauma centers (PTCs) are
unique in that these centers provide care that addresses the
specific physiological, anatomical, and social needs of
children.1 As adolescents move into adulthood, however, the
perceived need for these resources decreases. The largest pro-
portion of patients seen at trauma centers are young adults, a
population with physiological, anatomical and social needs
similar to older adolescents.2 Because the resources of PTCs
are comparatively scarce and may not be needed for older ado-
lescents, injured adolescents may also be treated either at an
adult trauma center (ATC) or a mixed trauma center (MTC) that
treats both adults and children, rather than at a PTC.
Trauma systems in which PTCs and either ATCs or MTCs
are found typically define a cutoff age for triage to either a pe-
diatric or primarily adult trauma center. This cutoff age var-
ies in different trauma systems based on local preferences and
practice patterns and is usually not based on outcome differ-
ences at different center types. Previous studies examining the
optimal trauma center type for children have mostly shown
an outcome advantage for children treated at a PTC or MTC
compared with those treated at an ATC.3-9 Although a consen-
susisformingfortheoptimaltreatmentcenterforyoungerchil-
dren, controversy still remains about the optimal location for
treating injured adolescents.10-14
Few studies have evaluated the outcome for adolescents
atdifferenttraumacentertypesafterinjury.7,13,14Studiesevalu-
ating outcome among adolescents treated at different types of
trauma centers have shown conflicting results, with some
showing different frequencies of interventions (eg, lapa-
rotomy and blood transfusion) and no difference in mortal-
ity, and others showing improved mortality.7,13,14 These pre-
vious studies, however, used regional data obtained from
maturetraumasystemsanddidnotaddressthisissueinalarger
national cohort in which more diversity in care and resource
availability may exist. Although patient demographics and in-
jury patterns have been proposed as explanations for differ-
ences in mortality, these differences were not consistently
observed even after controlling for patient and injury
features.3,4,6,8,9,15,16
Theobjectivesofthisarticlearetodeterminewhethertype
of trauma center designation (PTC, MTC, or ATC) is associ-
ated with mortality among adolescent trauma patients in a
sample obtained from the National Trauma Data Bank and to
determine differences among patients presenting to differ-
ent center types. A second objective was to determine the fi-
nal discharge disposition of survivors at different center types.
Methods
Data Source
This study was approved by the Children’
s National Medical
CenterInstitutionalReviewBoard.Becausethisstudywascon-
ducted using deidentified data, patient consent was not nec-
essary. All patient data were deidentified. Data were derived
from the 2010 National Trauma Data Bank (January 1 to De-
cember 31, 2010), a database maintained by the American Col-
lege of Surgeons that contains medical records of injured chil-
dren and adults treated at reporting trauma centers. Patients
who were aged 15 to 19 years and treated at a level I or level II
trauma center for a blunt or penetrating injury were in-
cluded. Patients who were transferred to a short-term gen-
eral stay hospital were excluded because their outcome was
unknown.Ofthe29 658recordsobtained,45weremissingdata
for the primary outcome (mortality) and were excluded, for a
final analysis data set of 29 613 records.
Statistical Analysis
Data analysis was conducted from January 15, 2013, to March
15, 2016. We performed multilevel logistic regression to iden-
tify the effect of trauma center type and trauma center level
on mortality and discharge disposition among survivors. We
separatelyevaluatedoverallmortalitythatincludeddeathsthat
occurred in the emergency department and in the hospital af-
ter admission as well as in-hospital mortality. We defined dis-
charge to rehabilitation as disposition to an intermediate, long-
term, or skilled nursing facility. Patient factors modeled
included sex, mechanism of injury, transfer status (trans-
ported directly from scene vs seen at another hospital before
arrival), initial systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg, the
initial motor score component of the Glasgow Coma Scale
(modeled as 5 binary variables representing 6 values), and Ab-
breviated Injury Scale [AIS] post-dot values for each of 9 body
regions (treated as binary variables for values <3 or ≥3 within
each of 9 body regions). Hospital-level variables included the
type of center (PTC, ATC, or MTC) and trauma center verifica-
tion level (I or II).
The amount of missingness among the covariates mod-
eled was between 0% and 4.5%. To manage missingness in the
covariates, we performed multiple imputation using a proce-
dure that accounted for the hierarchical structure of the data
set, creating 10 imputed data sets (eAppendix in the Supple-
ment).Becausemultipleimputationwasperformed,someper-
centages are estimates of the true percentage and do not have
associated exact numbers of patients. The 10 multiple impu-
tation data sets were analyzed using Mplus, version 7.3.17 Pa-
rameter estimates were averaged across the 10 analyses, and
Key Points
Question Is there a difference in the mortality rate for injured
adolescents treated at pediatric trauma centers compared with
those treated at adult trauma centers or mixed trauma centers
that treat both adults and children?
Findings In this study, after controlling for patient and injury
characteristics, adolescents treated at adult trauma centers and
mixed trauma centers had a higher risk of death than did
adolescents treated at pediatric trauma centers.
Meaning Injured adolescents treated at pediatric trauma centers
have a lower risk of death than those treated at mixed trauma
centers and adult trauma centers.

their SEs were computed using the Rubin method.18,19 Multi-
level logistic regression was used for model estimation, with
mortality or discharge to rehabilitation as the dependent vari-
able. Standard errors were computed using a robust sand-
wich estimator. Models with a random intercept were used to
account for the hierarchical data structure (patients nested
within hospitals). Comparisons of patient and center charac-
teristics between the 3 types of trauma centers were per-
formed using either 1-way analysis of variance or χ2 test as ap-
propriate using imputed data to obtain estimates for variables
withmissingvalues(SAS,version9.3,SASInstituteInc).P < .05
was considered significant. Model diagnostics were per-
formed measuring discrimination with area under the re-
ceiver operator curve and measuring calibration with the Hos-
mer-Lemeshow statistic, dividing records in deciles of
estimated probability of mortality.

those treated at PTCs (mean [SD] age, 17.4 [1.3], 17.1 [1.4], and
16.0 [1.0], respectively) and were more severely injured, in-
cluding more frequent hypotension (patients with initial blood
pressure <90 mm Hg: 3.2%, 2.3%, and 1.4%, respectively),
lower Glasgow Coma Scale motor scores (11.2, 10.5, and 6.4,
respectively), higher injury severity scores (19.7, 20.3, and 11.1,
respectively), and more frequent severe injuries of the head
(AIS post-dot value ≥3: 15.2, 15.6, and 11.3, respectively), chest

monly discharged to rehabilitation (3.3%) than adolescents
treated at either ATCs (5.0%) or MTCs (6.0%) (Table 1).
Adolescents treated at PTCs were more likely to be in-

pants were most common at ATCs (32.6%) and MTCs (34.3%)
compared with PTCs (18.5%). Penetrating injury mechanisms
(firearm and cut or pierce) were more common at ATCs (fire-
arm, 12.0%; cut or pierce, 7.3%) and MTCs (firearm, 8.3%;
cut or pierce, 7.1%) than at PTCs (firearm, 4.5%; cut or pierce,
4.1%), as were motorcyclist injuries (ATC, 3.0%; MTC, 2.7%;
PTC, 1.2%).
Unadjusted emergency department and overall mortality
was higher among adolescents treated at ATCs (emergency
department, 1.2%; overall, 3.2%) and MTCs (emergency
department, 1.0%; overall, 3.5%) compared with those
treated at PTCs (emergency department, 0.2%; overall, 0.4%)
(Table 1). The emergency department mortality of adoles-
cents arriving from the injury scene was higher among ado-
lescents treated at ATCs (1.5%) and MTCs (1.4%) than among
those treated at PTCs (0.3%), but was similar among those
transferred from another hospital at each center type (ATC,
0.3%; MTC, 0.4%; and PTC, 0.1%) (Table 1). After adjusting
for patient and center variables, overall mortality remained
higher at ATCs (odds ratio, 4.19; 95% CI, 1.30-13.51) and MTCs
(odds ratio, 6.68; 95% CI, 2.03-21.99) compared with PTCs
but was not different between level I and II centers (odds
ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59-0.99) (Table 3). The model derived
for these results show excellent discrimination and was well
calibrated, overall and among subgroups of patients
(Table 4). Similar significant differences in mortality between
adolescents treated at PTCs and other center types was
observed in the subgroup of adolescents who were admitted
to the hospital and in the subgroup of adolescents sustaining
only penetrating injuries (Table 3 and Table 5). After adjust-
ing for patient and center variables, no difference in disposi-
tion to rehabilitation was observed among the 3 center types
(Table 3).
Discussion
Injury is the leading cause of death and acquired disability
among adolescents.20 To reduce the effect of trauma in this
age group, it is essential to determine optimal treatment strat-
egies. Because adolescents straddle the gap between pediat-
ric and adult medicine, identifying differences in care among
PTCs, ATCs, and MTCs will help determine the most appro-
priate triage strategies or identify practice strategies that can
optimize the outcome for patients in this age group. We as-
sessed the populations presenting to PTCs vs ATCs and MTCs
and evaluated mortality at PTCs and other center types, con-
trollingforthesedifferences.Wefoundthattraumacenterveri-
fication level differed among these center types and that the
adolescent patients treated at PTCs were different from those
treated at ATCs and MTCs based on injury type, mechanism
of injury, severity of injury, and demographics.
After controlling for these differences, lower mortality was
observed among adolescents treated at PTCs compared with
those treated at ATCs and MTCs. This finding is similar to that
of studies that evaluated mortality differences among chil-
dren of all ages (including adolescents) and among younger
childrenonly.3,4,6,7,21Previousstudiesthathaveexaminedout-
comes for only adolescents did not find mortality differences
among center types.13,14 Both studies were performed using
state registry data (Ohio14 and Pennsylvania13) rather than data
obtained from a national sample. The study using data from
Ohio used propensity case matching, rather than multivari-
able regression analysis, and combined data from level I and
II PTCs to avoid identification of specific centers.14 Although
propensity case matching is an appropriate method when the
ratio between the number of predictors and outcome is low,

multivariable regression is preferred when this ratio is higher,
as in the cohort that we examined.22 Combining trauma cen-
ter designation levels could also have influenced the out-
come observed in the PTC cohort.14 The analysis that we used
differed from that in previous studies by using imputation
rather than data exclusion to manage missing data and by con-
sidering the hierarchical structure of the data (patients nested
in hospitals) in model development. Another difference is that
we separately evaluated mortality in adolescents surviving to
hospital admission.
Adolescent patients treated at ATCs and MTCs may have
features different from those treated at PTCs. Patients treated
at PTCs were younger, more likely to be transferred from other
hospitals, less severely injured, and had a different distribu-
tion of injury mechanisms. The demographic and injury se-
verity differences are consistent with most previous studies
including data from children of all ages3,9,16,23 and those con-
taining only adolescent data.13,14 The patient population dif-
ferences observed between those treated at PTCs and either
ATCs or MTCs may be explained by either first-responder tri-
age decision making or local triage criteria. For example, ado-
lescents injured by firearms may be preferentially brought to
ATCs or MTCs regardless of a given adolescent’
s age because

Although more adolescents treated at PTCs were trans-
ferred from another hospital, the emergency department mor-
tality of adolescents arriving at PTCs was similar to that of pa-
tients arriving at ATCs and MTCs. In addition, differences in
mortality between centers were similar when including and
excluding patients who died in the emergency department.
These results suggest that differences in mortality cannot be
explained by the stability of those transferred to different cen-
ter types. The greater injury severity of children and adoles-
centsseenatATCsandMTCscomparedwiththoseseenatPTCs
has been previously observed.6,10,11 Our study further de-
fines this difference by showing that higher injury severity is
related to more severe injuries in the head, thorax, and upper-
extremity body regions. Although a previous study sug-
gested improved functional outcome at PTCs vs other center
types,5 we observed no differences in disposition to a reha-
bilitation facility. This finding shows that the observed differ-
ences in mortality may not be associated with other outcome
measures and warrants separate analysis.

Without finding the cause of the mortality differences be-
tween center types, we cannot take appropriate steps to im-
proving outcomes at all centers. Other groups have found that
operative interventions, such as spleen and liver procedures,
were increased in children of all ages at ATCs and compared
with those at PTCs.4,24 In the adolescent patient population,
overall intervention rates, not limited to operative manage-
ment of solid organ injury, were higher at ATCs than PTCs.13
Determining differences in treatment practices between cen-
ter types will be necessary to show the reasons for differ-
ences in mortality rates and may suggest areas in patient man-
agement that can be modified to improve outcomes.
This study has several limitations. First, our analysis is
based on data from the National Trauma Data Bank that col-
lects data only from participatory centers. Because this data
set does not represent all trauma centers, it may result in re-
sponsebias.Second,althoughweobservedadifferenceinmor-
tality between those treated at PTCs and other center types,
our study does not provide information about what may ac-
count for these differences. Although we controlled for sev-
eralpotentialconfoundersthatmaycontributetomortalitydif-
ferencesatdifferentcentertypesandobservedexcellentmodel
fit, other unknown factors that we did not control for may ac-
count for these differences. Finally, although we used a large
sample from the National Trauma Data Bank, mortality was
sparselyrepresentedineachcentertype.Ourfindingswillneed
to be evaluated in a larger cohort of patients to further sup-
port our findings.
Conclusions
Trauma centers dedicated to the treatment of pediatric pa-
tients see a different adolescent population than do ATCs and
MTCs. After controlling for these differences, we observed that
adolescent trauma patients have lower overall and in-
hospital mortality when treated at PTCs. The optimal care of
adolescents at all center types requires the identification of
eitheradditionalpatientdifferencesortreatmentpracticesthat
account for this mortality difference. Analysis of the associa-
tion of specific care processes with mortality at center types
will be needed to further clarify the etiology of these differ-
ences in mortality.
