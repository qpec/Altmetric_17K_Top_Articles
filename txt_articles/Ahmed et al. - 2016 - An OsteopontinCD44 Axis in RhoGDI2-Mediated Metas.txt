Summary
RhoGDI2 specifically suppresses bladder cancer metastasis but not primary tumor growth, which 
involves tumor-associated macrophages. We report that macrophage-secreted osteopontin binds to 
CD44s on the tumor cells and promotes invasion and clonal growth. These effects are RhoGDI2-
sensitive and require CD44s binding to the Rac GEF TIAM1. Osteopontin expression correlates 
with tumor aggressiveness and poor clinical outcome in patients. Inhibiting this pathway potently 
blocked lung and lymph node metastasis; however, primary tumors and established metastasis 
were less sensitive. Osteopontin-CD44s-TIAM1 promotes clonal growth in vitro but not at high 
cell density. These data identify osteopontin-CD44-TIAM1-Rac axis as a RhoGDI2-sensitive 
pathway and potential therapeutic target in bladder cancer metastasis. They also elucidate the 
mechanism behind RhoGDI2 specificity for metastasis over established tumors.

 Ahmed et al. identify macrophage-secreted osteopontin as a critical mediator of bladder cancer 
cell invasion and clonal growth. The effect is mediated by RhoGDI2 and requires CD44s binding 
to Rac GEF TIAM1. Inhibiting this pathway specifically blocks the initial steps in bladder cancer 
metastasis.
Introduction
Metastasis, the major cause of death in bladder cancer, is a multi-step process that involves 
cell invasion, migration and colonization of distant organs (Kaplan et al., 2014; Knowles and 
Hurst, 2014; Talmadge and Fidler, 2010). Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor 2 (RhoGDI2) has 
been identified as a specific bladder cancer metastasis suppressor (Gildea et al., 2002). 
Reduced expression of RhoGDI2 is associated with decreased survival of bladder cancer 
patients (Theodorescu et al., 2004) and studies in animal models showed that its re-
expression specifically suppressed metastasis without affecting primary tumor growth or 
growth in culture (Gildea et al., 2002; Moissoglu et al., 2009). RhoGDI2 appears to suppress 
metastasis by modulating Rho GTPases signaling (Griner et al., 2014; Moissoglu et al., 
2009).
The tumor microenvironment, consisting of extracellular matrix (ECM), fibroblasts, 
vasculature and tumor associated macrophages (TAMs), is critical for tumor growth and 
metastasis (Luga et al., 2012; Quail and Joyce, 2013). TAMs in particular are implicated in a 
RhoGDI2-sensitive pathway of bladder cancer metastasis (Said et al., 2012). Loss of 
RhoGDI2 in the tumor cells alters tumor cell-TAM crosstalk to enhance both local 
inflammation and tumor cell invasion and growth. This pathway involves secretion of 
versican by the tumor cells, which stimulates secretion of inflammatory cytokines by the 
macrophages, which act on the tumor cells to promote metastatic growth. However, major 
features of this cell-cell communication circuit are poorly understood. We therefore set out 
to understand more fully how RhoGDI2 controls tumor cell-macrophage crosstalk in bladder 
carcinoma metastasis.

 Results
RhoGDI2 modulates invasion in response to macrophage-conditioned medium
These studies used the metastatic bladder cancer cell lines UMUC3 and T24T, and non-
metastatic T24 and RT4. UMUC3 and T24T express negligible levels of RhoGDI2 
compared to non-metastatic T24 and RT4 cells that express high levels of RhoGDI2 
(Theodorescu et al., 2004; Titus et al., 2005). These cells represent the genomic fingerprint 
of human cancer and have been found to correlate well with clinical behavior (Dancik et al., 
2011). Re-expression of RhoGDI2 strongly inhibited experimental metastasis while having 
little effect on the primary tumor growth (Moissoglu et al., 2009; Titus et al., 2005). In 
UMUC3 cells, RhoGDI2 expression had no effect on cell invasion through basement 
membrane protein (matrigel) under basal conditions (Figure 1A, B & C). However, cell 
invasion was stimulated by co-culture with Raw 264.7 macrophages, which was almost 
completely suppressed by RhoGDI2 (Figure 1B & C). Adding macrophage conditioned 
media (MCM) to untreated UMUC3 cells similarly induced invasion in a dose-dependent 
manner (Figure 1D), indicating that a secreted factor(s) mediated these effects. By contrast, 
macrophage-conditioned medium had no effect on transwell migration without the matrix 
coating (Figure S1A). Likewise, fibroblast (L cells) conditioned medium did not induce 
UMUC3 invasion (Figure S1B), suggesting cell type specificity.
To further investigate the RhoGDI2-dependence of these events, we prepared UMUC3 and 
T24T cells stably expressing RhoGDI2 or a defective GTPase-binding mutant, 
RhoGDI2D182R (Figure S6G) at the level of non-metastatic T24 cells (Figure S1C). 
Matrigel invasion assays showed that wild type (WT) RhoGDI2 suppressed macrophage-
conditioned medium induced invasion while the D182R mutant was inactive (Figures 1E & 
S1D). However, RhoGDI2 did not affect serum-induced invasion (Figure 1F). To examine 
the generality of these findings and address whether loss of RhoGDI2 can be sufficient to 
induce invasion, RhoGDI2 was knocked down in non-metastatic RT4 cells. RhoGDI2 
depletion conferred macrophage-conditioned medium induced invasion in these cells (Figure 
S1E, F). Together, these data show that RhoGDI2 specifically suppresses invasion stimulated 
by a macrophage-derived factor.
Osteopontin is the active factor in macrophage-conditioned medium
To identify the macrophage-derived tumor cell invasion-stimulating factor, we fractionated 
macrophage-conditioned medium. First, high-speed ultracentrifugation to distinguish soluble 
factor(s) from micro-vesicles showed that only the macrophage-conditioned medium 
supernatant induced invasion (Figure S2A). Macrophage-conditioned medium was then 
filtered using different molecular weight cut offs. These experiments showed no loss of 
activity after filtration through 3, 10, 30 and 50 kDa filters but a dramatic loss with a 100 
kDa molecular weight cut off (Figure S2B). This result suggested a soluble factor in a range 
of 50–100 kDa. Osteopontin (OPN) is one of the macrophage-secreted molecules (Takahashi 
et al., 2000). Its’ molecular weight is approximately 65 kDa, which falls within experimental 
range of 50–100 kDa for a potential active factor. It is also implicated in tumor growth and 
metastasis (Ahmed et al., 2011; Ahmed and Kundu, 2010). This prompted us to test its 
presence in macrophage-conditioned medium. Raw 264.7 macrophage conditioned medium

 showed time dependent OPN protein secretion (Figure S2C), which quantitative ELISA 
showed reached ~3 μg/ml after 24 hr (Figure S2D).
To investigate whether OPN is the active component in macrophage-conditioned medium, 
we depleted OPN from macrophage-conditioned medium using control or anti-OPN IgG. 
This procedure removed 69% of the OPN (Figure 2A, B) and reduced macrophage-
conditioned medium induced UMUC3 invasion by 68% (Figure 2C). Furthermore, 
transducing Raw 264.7 cells with OPN shRNA (Figure S2E), which decreased OPN 
secretion by approximately 70%, inhibited invasion to a similar extent compared to control 
shRNA cells (Figure 2D). To test whether OPN was sufficient to induce bladder cancer cell 
invasion, assays were carried out with recombinant OPN. Both mouse and human OPN 
stimulated invasion of UMUC3 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Figure S2F). Lastly, 
expression of WT but not mutant RhoGDI2 strongly suppressed OPN-induced invasion in 
UMUC3 and T24T cells, while knock down of RhoGDI2 in RT4 cells increased OPN 
induced invasion (Figures 2E, F & S2G). Together, these data show that OPN is the major 
factor in macrophage-conditioned medium that promotes RhoGDI2-sensitive bladder cancer 
cell invasion.
OPN expression and clinical outcomes in patients
In order to assess clinical relevance, we looked at five bladder cancer patient cohorts (total n 
= 633) where OPN was profiled in whole tissue from both tumors and normal bladder. In all 
cohorts, OPN expression was significantly up-regulated in muscle invasive tumor tissue 
compared to normal bladder tissue (Figure 3A–E, FC of 2.64 – 9.34, p < 0.001). In the two 
patient cohorts that included information about disease-specific survival, high expression 
correlated with poorer outcomes, which was statistically significant in the CNUH cohort 
(Figure 3F, HR = 2.31, p = 0.028). In the MSKCC cohort, a similar trend was observed but 
did not reach statistical significance (Figure 3G, HR = 1.91, p = 0.062), possibly due in part 
to lower n (165 vs. 87). We further investigated human specimens for correlations between 
metastasis and both OPN expression and macrophage infiltration. OPN staining in metastatic 
tumors (both the primary tumors and the corresponding lymph node metastases from the 
same patient) was significantly increased relative to non-metastatic primary tumors 
(p<0.001; Figures 3H,J & S3A). Macrophage infiltration (CD68 expression) followed a 
similar pattern (Figures 3I,J & S3B). The increase in macrophage content and OPN 
expression with tumor progression and poor prognosis are consistent with a role for OPN in 
bladder cancer metastasis.
CD44 mediates OPN-induced invasion
OPN signals through receptors that include CD44 and several integrins (Weber et al., 1997). 
To determine which receptor mediates UMUC3 invasion, cells were pre-treated with control 
IgG or function blocking IgG against CD44 (Siiskonen et al., 2014), integrins αvβ3 (Ahmed 
and Kundu, 2010), β1 or β4 (Oh et al., 2005). Anti-CD44 antibody potently inhibited 
macrophage-conditioned medium induced invasion whereas none of the integrin antibodies 
had any effect (Figure 4A). Western blot analysis, using Hela cells that express substantial 
levels of CD44 for comparison, showed that UMUC3 cells express high levels of CD44, 
which was unaffected by expression of WT or mutant RhoGDI2 (Figure 4B). The CD44

 blocking antibody also blocked UMUC3 and T24T cells invasion in response to recombinant 
OPN (Figure 4C, D & E). Thus, CD44 appears to be the critical OPN receptor in this 
pathway.
The CD44 gene contains 20 exons, with exons 1–5 found in all isoforms except the soluble 
isoform, CD44sol. The standard isoform (CD44s) consists of exons 1–5, 16–18 and 20 
(Williams et al., 2013), with longer isoforms containing variable insertions of exons 6–15 
(Figure S4A). To investigate the splice isoforms in UMUC3 cells, we carried out polymerase 
chain reactions (PCR) using primers that give products of different sizes for every transcript 
(Figure S4A). These primers gave a product of 669 bp, which represents transcript variants 
four or eight (Figure S4B). When cDNA isolated from UMUC3 cells was amplified using 
PCR primers specific for transcript variant four (CD44s), it gave the expected 714 bp 
product (Figure S4C). Thus, UMUC3 cells express CD44s.
To test its function, we constructed an shRNA-resistant CD44s-GFP rescue vector from the 
UMUC3 cDNA library. Its transduction into CD44 shRNA knock down cells and FACS 
sorting yielded cells where the transgene was expressed at high levels (Figure S5A). Re-
expression of CD44s fully rescued macrophage-conditioned medium induced invasion in 
knockdown cells (Figure 4F). Together, these experiments identify CD44s as the critical 
OPN receptor that mediates bladder cancer cell invasion.
Interaction of TIAM1 with CD44s mediates OPN induced invasion
The cytoplasmic tail of CD44s interacts with the Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor 
(GEF) T cell lymphoma antigen (TIAM1) (Bourguignon et al., 2000; Terawaki et al., 2010). 
TIAM1 activates the Rac subfamily of Rho GTPases and its expression is associated with 
lymph node metastasis in lung adenocarcinoma (Liu et al., 2014). The role of RhoGDI2 and 
involvement of Rho GTPases in invasion and metastasis (Magi et al., 2014) led us to test this 
pathway. Stable depletion of TIAM1 with shRNA in UMUC3 cells (Figure 5A) strongly 
inhibited invasion in response to both macrophage-conditioned medium and OPN (Figures 
5B & C). To test more specifically whether the TIAM1 interaction with CD44 is necessary 
for invasion, we made point mutations in the CD44s rescue vector to reduce its affinity for 
TIAM1 (CD44s-E335K/E338K-GFP) (Terawaki et al., 2010) (Figure S5B). In stable CD44 
knockdown cells reconstituted with WT or mutant CD44s-GFP at equivalent levels (Figure 
S5A), only WT CD44s rescued invasion (Figures 5D, E and S5C). These data show that the 
interaction of CD44s with TIAM1 is required for OPN-stimulated invasion. To ascertain the 
biochemical link between TIAM1 and RhoGDI2, we examined Rac1 activity. Both 
macrophage-conditioned medium and OPN activated Rac1 (Figure S6A, B), which was 
inhibited by CD44 knock down and rescued by WT but not with mutant CD44 (Figure S6C, 
D). Further, these effects were blocked with WT but not the Rac-binding defective RhoGDI2 
mutant (Figure S6E, F & G). Together, these data establish a RhoGDI2-sensitive, OPN-
CD44-TIAM1 pathway that activates Rac1 to promote bladder cancer invasion.
Effect on clonal cell growth
Clonal cell growth, the ability of a single cell to expand after colonizing a distant site, is a 
critical step in metastasis (Brady et al., 2016; Fidler, 1990; Fiebig et al., 2004; Malanchi et 
Ahmed et al.

 al., 2012; Matano et al., 2015). We therefore examined whether the OPN-CD44-TIAM1 
pathway governs this behavior. When UMUC3 cells were plated at single cell density, 
macrophage-conditioned medium showed potent, dose-dependent stimulation of colony 
formation (Figure 6A, B). Both OPN knockdown in the macrophages and antibody depletion 
of OPN inhibited this effect in UMUC3 (Figure 6C, D) and T24T cells (Figure 6E). 
Function blocking anti-CD44 antibody also blocked macrophage-conditioned medium 
induced clonal growth in both cell lines (Figures 7A, B, & S7A, B), as did knockdown of 
CD44, which was rescued by WT CD44s but not the TIAM1-binding mutant (Figures 7C & 
S7C). Knockdown of TIAM1 also inhibited macrophage-conditioned medium stimulated 
clonal growth (Figures 7D and S7D). Lastly, we tested the role of RhoGDI2. Expression of 
WT but not mutant RhoGDI2 suppressed macrophage-conditioned medium induced clonal 
growth in UMUC3 (Figures 7E and S7E) and T24T cells (Figure S7F, G).
To test whether loss of RhoGDI2 is sufficient to permit invasive but non-metastatic T24 cells 
to form colonies after stimulation with OPN, we stably depleted RhoGDI2 in these cells. 
Remarkably, RhoGDI2 knockdown conferred macrophage-conditioned medium and OPN-
dependent clonal growth (Figures 7F and S7H, I). Together, these data provide strong 
evidence that the RhoGDI2-sensitive, OPN-CD44-TIAM1 pathway governs clonal growth in 
bladder cancer.
CD44 regulates metastasis
To determine whether CD44 governs metastasis in vivo, we assayed experimental lung 
metastasis after lateral tail vein injection of tumor cells. Stable knockdown of CD44 in 
UMUC3 cells strongly suppressed lung metastasis in this model. Over-expression of WT 
CD44s-GFP but not the TIAM1-binding mutant, not only rescued but also increased 
metastasis to levels well above the parent cell line, consistent with the higher CD44 
expression in these cells (Figures 8A,D and S5A). We also tested the effect of the CD44 
function-blocking antibody hermes-1 (Figure S8A). Co-injection of anti-CD44 IgG with the 
UMUC3 cells, with antibody injections continuing for the duration of the experiment, 
inhibited metastasis by 96.7% (Figure 8B). To confirm these results, we also examined an 
orthotopic model in which tumors in the bladder wall metastasize to draining lymph nodes 
(Muramaki et al., 2004). Expression of WT but not mutant CD44s potently controlled 
metastasis in this model (Figure 8C).
To determine whether the CD44 pathway was required only for the initial establishment of 
metastasis or their continued expansion, we also tested a protocol in which antibody 
injections were started 1 week after cell injection. Under this condition, metastasis was 
reduced by 63% (Figure 8B), much less than when co-injected. This result prompted us to 
re-examine cell growth, this time using cells plated at higher density where growth is no 
longer clonal. In these assays, macrophage-conditioned medium was only weakly 
stimulatory (Figure S8C). Growth at normal density is also independent of RhoGDI2 
(Gildea et al., 2002). We then tested tumor growth in vivo. CD44 knock down or rescue with 
WT or mutant CD44 did not cause any significant changes in growth of the primary 
subcutaneous (Figure S8D) or orthotopic tumors (Figure S8B). We conclude that a

 RhoGDI2-sensitive OPN-CD44-TIAM1-Rac1 pathway is critical for the initial steps in 
bladder cancer metastasis but less so for growth of established metastasis.
Discussion
In this study, we observed that RhoGDI2 specifically controls cell invasion stimulated by 
macrophage-conditioned medium. Interestingly, clonal cell growth was also stimulated by 
macrophage-conditioned medium and inhibited by RhoGDI2, thus, identifying a second step 
in metastasis that is governed by this pathway. OPN was identified as the critical mediator of 
cell invasion and colony formation based on shRNA-mediated knockdown of OPN in the 
macrophages, by antibody depletion of the macrophage-conditioned medium, and by direct 
stimulation with recombinant OPN. Although we cannot exclude other minor factors, the 
close correspondence between the reduction in OPN levels and cell invasion indicates that 
OPN is the major invasion/clonal growth stimulator produced by macrophages. 
Bioinformatic analysis and Immunohistochemistry of human patient samples also showed 
that OPN levels increase in muscle invasive/metastatic tumors compared to non-invasive/
non-metastatic tumors and normal tissue.
OPN is an ECM-associated, cytokine-like molecule that promotes tumor growth and 
metastasis in number of systems (Ahmed et al., 2011; Ahmed and Kundu, 2010; Chanmee et 
al., 2014; Joyce and Pollard, 2009; Rao et al., 2013; Rittling and Chambers, 2004; Wai and 
Kuo, 2004). OPN levels increase during cancer progression and high OPN is a marker of 
poor prognosis in bladder cancer (Ang et al., 2005; Zaravinos et al., 2011; Zaravinos et al., 
2012). Thus, the identification of OPN as the key macrophage-derived factor that stimulates 
metastasis correlates well with its known properties.
Both shRNA-mediated knockdown and blocking antibody experiments identified CD44 as 
the OPN receptor that stimulates invasion and clonal growth. CD44s is the major isoform 
expressed in UMUC3 cells, and was able to fully rescue CD44 knockdown. Interestingly, 
transcriptome analysis of recurrent muscle invasive bladder cancer patients compared to 
newly diagnosed patients revealed increased CD44 expression (Choi et al., 2014; Zhang et 
al., 2014). Moreover, we found that TIAM1, which binds the CD44s cytoplasmic domain 
and functions as a GEF for Rac1 (Terawaki et al., 2010), is the critical intracellular effector 
required for stimulation of invasion. Indeed, OPN stimulation activated Rac1, which 
required TIAM1 and CD44, and was blocked by RhoGDI2. Thus, elucidation of the OPN-
CD44-TIAM1-Rac1 axis provides a logical connection to the known function of RhoGDI2 
as a regulator of Rho GTPases. In addition to UMUC3 and T24T cells, consistent effects 
were also observed in non-metastatic T24 and RT4 cells that express high levels of 
RhoGDI2. Together with the human gene expression data for OPN and CD44, these results 
provide strong evidence that the RhoGDI2-sensitive OPN-CD44-TIAM1-Rac1 pathway is 
generally relevant to human cancer (Figure 8E).
The stronger requirement for a RhoGDI2-sensitive OPN-CD44-TIAM1 pathway in the 
initial establishment of metastasis than for subsequent growth of established metastasis is 
very likely related to previous observations that RhoGDI2 expression does not affect 
primary tumors or growth in culture. These in vivo findings correlate well with in vitro

 results that OPN-CD44-TIAM1 signaling promotes RhoGDI2-sensitive clonal cell growth 
but has only slight effects on growth in denser cultures. One possible explanation for these 
observations is that bladder cancer cells might secrete a paracrine factor or factors that 
promote their survival and growth, which would require a critical cell density to reach 
sufficient concentrations. Thus, only at clonal densities would tumor cell survival and 
growth depend on macrophage-derived OPN. Tumor invasion toward macrophages would 
therefore place cells in a local environment that supports their further expansion. 
Identification of tumor cell-derived paracrine factors that support their growth in denser 
conditions could provide a means to sensitize established tumors to inhibition of this 
pathway.
These results identify two major clinically relevant directions for future work. First, many 
patients are diagnosed with non-invasive bladder cancer and are treated with local 
chemotherapy, but tumors eventually progress to invasion and metastasis, which is incurable. 
The ~97% inhibition by anti-CD44 antibody in our experimental model suggests that 
blockade of the OPN-CD44-TIAM1-Rac1 pathway could be used to prevent metastasis in 
these patients. Second, identifying tumor cell-derived paracrine factors that support survival 
and growth under conditions of higher cell density may provide a path to combined therapy 
that would be effective in primary tumors or established metastasis.
Experimental procedures
Metastasis assays
For lung metastasis, stably transduced UMUC3 cell lines at 1×106/animal in 200 μl serum 
free medium were injected through the lateral tail veins into 6–8 week old athymic nude 
mice (nu/nu; Charles river). In some cases, UMUC3 cells were injected in medium 
containing with 50 μg hermes-1 antibody, with subsequent injections of 50 μg antibody 
twice/week. An additional group of mice received antibody injections starting 1 week after 
initial injections. In all cases, after a total of six weeks, mice were euthanized and lungs 
dissected. For lymph node metastasis, 6–8 weeks of age nude mice were challenged 
intravesically with 5×105 luciferase labeled UMUC3 cells via direct injection into the 
bladder wall. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, the surgical site cleaned, and a 
small incision made to expose and express the bladder. Tumor cells were injected directly 
into the bladder wall. The peritoneum and cutaneous tissues were closed and mice treated 
with Buprenorphine SR (0.5 mg/kg) for pain management. Mice were recovered on room 
air. Luciferase signal was measured to determine tumor burden. Mice were euthanized 4 
weeks after tumor challenge. Lumbo-sacral (retroperitoneal) and inguinal lymph nodes, 
which were in close vicinity and difficult to differentiate from orthotopic tumor luciferase 
signal, were harvested for all mice and pooled to investigate metastatic burden with qPCR 
(Cheng et al., 2013; Muramaki et al., 2004). Genomic DNA was isolated using a Qiagen kit 
(69504). To assess metastasis, nested qPCR for human chromosome 12p was performed 
(Nicholson et al., 2004; Nitz et al., 2008). 1 μg genomic DNA was amplified with 100 nM 
primer sets one; forward (5′ CTGACAGACAACCTTGCTCACTCAC 3′) and reverse (5′ 
AGGGAGTGCAGTGTGTCACTCTAGC 3′) for 8 cycles in 20 μl reaction. 1 μl from the 
first PCR reaction was used with 200 nM second set of primer; forward (5′

 TGACCCTGATAAAGTTTCTTGGAA 3′) and reverse (5′ 
GGGACAGACACTGAGCCTTGAG 3′) to amplify the final product. Genomic DNA from 
without injected nude mice was used as negative control for qPCR. Human and mouse actin 
specific primers forward (5′ ATCATTGCTCCTCCTGAGCGC 3′) and reverse (5′ 
TACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCA 3′) were used to amplify the actin as reference. Lung 
metastasis experiments were performed with the approval of IACUC at Yale University. 
Lymph node metastasis experiment was performed with the approval of IACUC at 
University of Colorado.
Subcutaneous tumor growth assay
6–8 weeks of age nude mice were used for the experiments. Mice were challenged 
subcutaneously with 5×105 UMUC3 cells per site, 4 sites per mouse. Tumors were measured 
twice weekly using calipers and volume determined using the formula: V = (S2 x L)/2 where 
V=volume, S=shortest diameter, and L=longest diameter. The volumes of 4 tumor sites were 
averaged across each mouse. Measurements were normalized per group to values 7 days 
after tumor challenge. This experiment was performed with the approval of IACUC at 
University of Colorado.
Gene expression datasets
We carried out a comprehensive search of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (Barrett et 
al., 2011), Array Express (Rustici et al., 2013), and the literature, and identified all bladder 
cancer patient cohorts that contained normal bladder tissue samples and clinical information 
about patient stage. Five cohorts (n= 633) were identified: 55 patients profiled at Aarhus 
University Hospital, Skejby (AUH cohort (Dyrskjot et al., 2004), downloaded from GEO, 
accession #GSE3167); 62 patients profiled by Stransky and colleagues (Stransky cohort 
(Stransky et al., 2006), downloaded from Array Express, accession #E-TABM-147), 154 
patients profiled by Lindgren and colleagues (Lindgren cohort (Lindgren et al., 2010), 
downloaded from GEO, accession #GSE19915), 233 patients profiled at Chungbuk National 
University Hospital (CNUH cohort (Kim et al., 2010) downloaded from GEO, accession 
#GSE13507), and 129 patients profiled at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
(MSKCC cohort (Sanchez-Carbayo et al., 2006) downloaded from supplemental material to 
publication). The processed data was downloaded and analyzed in all cases.
Patient specimens and TMA construction
Specimens included archived paraffin blocks from patients who underwent radical 
cystectomy or cystoprostatectomy for muscle-invasive UCC (pathological stage pT2 or 
greater). Primary bladder tumors that were used for analysis were either non-metastatic 
(n=60) or metastatic to regional lymph nodes (n=86). Paired lymph node metastases from 
the latter group were available in 73 cases for analysis. All specimens were re-reviewed by 
one of the authors (DH) for diagnostic accuracy, and three tumor regions per specimen were 
used for tissue microarray generation. This is study was approved by the UCSD Institutional 
Review Board with a waiver of consent granted.

 Immunohistochemistry and Scoring
Slides were deparaffinized and rehydrated according to standard serial histo-clear and 
ethanol wash steps. For CD68, antigen retrieval was performed by Tris-EDTA buffer 
incubation [10 mM Tris base, 1 mM EDTA (pH 9.0)] using a household vegetable steamer 
for 20 min followed by cool down to room temperature for 10 min. No antigen retrieval was 
required for OPN. Slides were incubated either with CD68 antibody (1:50, clone PG-M1, 
Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) or OPN antibody (1:500, ab8848, Abcam, Cambridge, United 
Kingdom) overnight at 4°C. For immunohistochemical detection HRP-Polymer followed by 
DAB (Abcam) were used, and slides were subsequently counterstained with hematoxylin. 
Osteopontin immunostaining was scored semi-quantitatively using a range of 0 (no 
staining), 1 (weak staining), 2 (moderate staining) and 3 (intense staining). CD68 positive 
cells were scored semi-quantitatively as a percentage, in steps of 10%.
Statistical analyses
For gene expression analysis, probes were identified that corresponded to OPN (CNUH 
cohort) or its alternative name SPP1 (remaining cohorts). If multiple probes corresponded to 
the gene, then the probe with the highest mean expression was used. Fold-change (FC) was 
used to characterize the difference in expression between muscle invasive tumors and normal 
tumors. p-values were calculated using the non-parametric Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. We 
generated Kaplan-Meier curves for patients with low and high expression of OPN, using the 
median as the cut-point. Disease-specific survival was used as the endpoint. Hazard ratios 
and log-rank p-values were obtained using the coxph function in R. For human sample IHC 
analysis; p-values evaluating change in expression scores between matched samples (Met 
primary vs Mets) and independent samples (Non-met Primary vs. Met Primary and Non-met 
Primary vs. Mets) were calculated using the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test and 
the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, respectively. Other experiments were analyzed with one-way or 
two-way ANOVA and two-tailed unpaired t test.

 Significance
Metastasis is the major cause of death from bladder cancer. RhoGDI2 has been identified 
as a critical inhibitor of metastasis in bladder cancer but has little effect on growth of the 
primary tumor. We now report that RhoGDI2 inhibits responses of bladder cancer cells to 
osteopontin secreted by macrophages in the tumor microenvironment, which promotes 
bladder cancer invasion and clonal growth through CD44 and TIAM1. These events, 
however, are less important for growth of established tumors or higher density cultures. 
Elucidating this pathway identifies therapeutic targets for initial steps in metastasis and 
suggests a strategy for developing effective treatments for established metastasis.

 Highlights
•
RhoGDI2 inhibits macrophage stimulated bladder cancer invasion and 
clonal growth.
•
Macrophage-secreted Osteopontin induces these effects via CD44 and 
Rac GEF TIAM1.
•
This pathway is vital for initiation of metastasis but not for established 
tumors.

CD44s-GFP (n=10), *p < 0.05. (B) UMUC3 cells were injected with or without 50 μg/
mouse anti-CD44 (hermes-1) antibody. For some mice, antibody injection started 1 week 
after cell injections. Lung metastasis was determined as in (A); Values are mean ± SEM, 
fold change relative to PBS. *p < 0.05, PBS (n=5), CD44 antibody with cells (n=5) and 
CD44 antibody after 1 week (n=5). (C) Luciferase labeled UMUC3 cells in which CD44 
was stably depleted, were rescued with GFP only (control), WT CD44-GFP or Mut CD44-
GFP. Cells were injected orthotopically and lymph nodes metastasis quantified as described 
in experimental procedures. Values are mean ± SEM, CD44 shRNA + GFP (n=7); CD44 
shRNA + WT CD44s-GFP (n=8); CD44 shRNA + Mut CD44s-GFP (n=8), *p < 0.05. (D) 
Representative H&E images of mouse lung from the experiment described in (A). Areas of 
high metastasis marked with dotted line (upper panel, scale bar-500 μM) and higher 
magnification from marked area is shown in lower panel, (scale bar, 100 μM). (E) Graphical 
presentation of bladder cancer cells (BCC) and tumor microenvironment communication.
