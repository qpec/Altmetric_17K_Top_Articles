ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To compare the risk for all cause and overdose 
mortality in people with opioid dependence during 
and after substitution treatment with methadone or 
buprenorphine and to characterise trends in risk of 
mortality after initiation and cessation of treatment.
Design
Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Data sOurCes
Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and LILACS to September 
2016.
stuDy seleCtiOn
Prospective or retrospective cohort studies in people 
with opioid dependence that reported deaths from all 
causes or overdose during follow-up periods in and out 
of opioid substitution treatment with methadone or 
buprenorphine.
Data extraCtiOn anD synthesis
Two independent reviewers performed data extraction 
and assessed study quality. Mortality rates in and out 
of treatment were jointly combined across methadone 
or buprenorphine cohorts by using multivariate 
random effects meta-analysis.
results
There were 19 eligible cohorts, following 122 885 people 
treated with methadone over 1.3-13.9 years and 15 831 
people treated with buprenorphine over 1.1-4.5 years. 
Pooled all cause mortality rates were 11.3 and 36.1 per 
1000 person years in and out of methadone treatment 
(unadjusted out-to-in rate ratio 3.20, 95% confidence 
interval 2.65 to 3.86) and reduced to 4.3 and 9.5 in and 
out of buprenorphine treatment (2.20, 1.34 to 3.61). In 
pooled trend analysis, all cause mortality dropped 
sharply over the first four weeks of methadone 
treatment and decreased gradually two weeks after 
leaving treatment. All cause mortality remained stable 
during induction and remaining time on buprenorphine 
treatment. Overdose mortality evolved similarly, with 
pooled overdose mortality rates of 2.6 and 12.7 per 
1000 person years in and out of methadone treatment 
(unadjusted out-to-in rate ratio 4.80, 2.90 to 7.96) and 
1.4 and 4.6 in and out of buprenorphine treatment.
COnClusiOns
Retention in methadone and buprenorphine treatment 
is associated with substantial reductions in the risk for 
all cause and overdose mortality in people dependent 
on opioids. The induction phase onto methadone 
treatment and the time immediately after leaving 
treatment with both drugs are periods of particularly 
increased mortality risk, which should be dealt with by 
both public health and clinical strategies to mitigate 
such risk. These findings are potentially important, but 
further research must be conducted to properly 
account for potential confounding and selection bias 
in comparisons of mortality risk between opioid 
substitution treatments, as well as throughout periods 
in and out of each treatment.
Introduction
Opioid dependence is a rising drug use disorder with 
substantial contribution to the global disease burden. 
The absolute number (age standardised prevalence) of 
people with opioid dependence worldwide increased 
from 10.4 million (0.20%) in 1990 to 15.5 million (0.22%) 
in 2010, and the disability adjusted years of life lost 
attributable to opioid dependence rose from 5.3 million 
(0.21% of global disease burden) in 1990 to 9.2 million 
(0.37%) in 2010.1
Opioid substitution treatment, either with metha-
done or buprenorphine, has been shown to be safe 
and effective in suppressing illicit opioid use,2 3 
 
improving physical and mental wellbeing,4 5  and 
reducing all cause and overdose mortality.6  Growing 
evidence, however, suggests that mortality experience 
during and after opioid substitution treatment is time 
varying and differs by type of drug.6-10  Methadone, a 
full opioid agonist, might pose an excess risk of death 
from overdose during treatment induction if initial 
doses are too high or coexist with illicit opioid use.6 7 10 
 
Buprenorphine, a partial agonist, is less effective in 
retaining patients in treatment,3  which seems a major 
weakness because mortality increases significantly in 
the period immediately after treatment stops.10 11  Nev-
ertheless, studies of individual cohorts have generally

In patients using methadone maintenance treatment there are, on average, 25 
fewer deaths/1000 person years than in patients who discontinue it. Mortality risk 
among opioid users during treatment is less than a third of that expected in the 
absence of opioid substitution treatment
Buprenorphine maintenance treatment is probably also effective in reducing 
mortality in opioid users, but quantification of averted deaths requires further studies
The mortality risk in the induction phase of methadone (first four weeks) is high but 
seems to decreases substantially during this period, with a further stabilisation at 
around six deaths/1000 person years in the remaining time in treatment. This did 
not occur with buprenorphine. The mortality risk in the four weeks immediately after 
cessation of either treatment is high and could exceed 30 deaths/1000 person years

been under-powered to detect potential differences in 
mortality risk by time interval in and out of treatment, 
and long term large trials comparing the effect of 
methadone and buprenorphine on all cause and over-
dose mortality are hardly feasible.3  In this context, a 
systematic review of cohort studies can provide valu-
able evidence on the mortality experience of opioid 
dependent people at different periods of methadone 
and buprenorphine substitution treatment that could 
guide clinicians and policymakers in the optimal pro-
vision of treatment.12
In this systematic review and meta-analysis we syn-
thesised results from cohort studies on mortality among 
patients receiving opioid substitution treatment to 
obtain pooled estimates of all cause and overdose mor-
tality rates during periods in and out of treatment with 
methadone and buprenorphine, evaluate heterogeneity 
of mortality rates across cohort characteristics, and 
investigate changes in mortality rates over time in and 
out of treatment, particularly within the first weeks 
after treatment initiation and cessation.
Methods
search strategy and inclusion criteria
We searched Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and LILACS 
by using different combinations of free text and data-
base specific index terms related to the topics of opioid 
dependence, opioid substitution treatment, mortality, 
and cohort studies. Details of the full search strategy 
are provided in appendix 1. The search was updated to 
September 2016, with no language restrictions. We also 
searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 
reviewed the reference lists of relevant original papers 
and reviews, screened articles in the PubMed “related 
citations” section, searched online for technical reports 
and monographs, and consulted experts and investiga-
tors with ongoing studies in opioid dependence. We 
followed the PRISMA statement for reporting system-
atic reviews and meta-analyses.13
We included cohort studies comparing mortality 
among people with opioid dependence. To be eligible, 
studies had to include follow-up data during and after 
opioid substitution treatment with methadone or 
buprenorphine. The prespecified exclusion criteria 
were as follows:
• No data in humans
• No original research (reviews, editorials, non-re-
search letters, protocols)
• Study design other than observational cohort (clini-
cal trials, case-control studies, cross sectional sur-
veys, case reports, case series, qualitative research)
• Study not focused on people with opioid dependence 
• People in prison or recently released
• Treatment unknown or other than methadone or 
buprenorphine maintenance (methadone detoxifica-
tion, opioid antagonist therapy, therapeutic community)
• No all cause or overdose mortality as outcome or no 
deaths over follow-up
• Insufficient data to compute mortality rates during 
periods in and out of treatment (number of deaths 
and person years broken down by follow-up period in 
and out of treatment).
For cohorts originating several reports, we used data 
from non-overlapping follow-up periods from each 
report whenever possible or selected the publication 
with the longest follow-up.
study selection and data extraction
Two investigators independently reviewed the titles and 
abstracts identified in the search and retrieved articles 
to determine eligibility and to extract study data. Dis-
agreements or uncertainties were resolved by consen-
sus with an additional investigator.
For each eligible study, we retrieved information on 
baseline population characteristics, including study 
location, sex and age distribution, primary opioid of 
misuse, and prevalence of opioid injection, non-opi-
oid drug use, HIV infection, and psychiatric and med-
ical comorbidity; number of cohort participants 
entering opioid substitution treatment during the 
study period (untreated participants and those under 
other types of treatment were excluded); treatment 
features, including drug type (methadone or buprenor-
phine), average daily dose, induction method (inpa-
tient or ambulatory), and provider (addiction 
medicine specialist or general practitioner); and main 
follow-up characteristics, including calendar period, 
average length of follow-up from the start of mainte-
nance treatment (excluding any previous detoxifica-
tion period), loss to follow-up, and mortality 
outcomes. We also registered detailed information on 
the number of deaths, person years at risk, and mor-
tality rates from all causes and overdose during fol-
low-up periods in and out of treatment and, whenever 
possible, during specific time intervals since treat-
ment initiation and cessation. Finally, we registered 
information on first and subsequent treatment epi-
sodes (table A in appendix 2) and on completeness of 
treatment (table B in appendix 2).
We specifically designed a quality assessment form 
based on standardised and extensively used instru-
ments: the methodology checklist for cohort studies 
developed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines 
Network14  and the checklist for drug related studies 
developed by the National Drug and Alcohol Research 
Centre, Australia.15  The design process, based on a thor-
ough review of the above sources, included the develop-
ment of different proposals, discussion of their 
appropriateness, and final agreement among the 
authors. The final version comprised separate sections 
according to the study design and was based on a “star 
system” score approach,16 including a general appraisal 
of external and internal validity and of the biases rele-
vant to cohort studies, plus an ad hoc assessment of 
reporting for studies on mortality during and after opi-
oid substitution treatment (appendix 3).

and out of treatment by dividing the number of deaths 
registered in each period by the person years contrib-
uted by all participants to that period. If not explicitly 
reported, we derived the number of person years by 
treatment period from the available summary statistics 
on follow-up and treatment retention or the reported 
mortality rates. We computed exact 95% confidence 
intervals for the underlying mortality rates by assuming 
a Poisson distribution for the observed number of 
deaths and fixed person years at risk.
Cause specific mortality rates in and out of treatment 
were jointly combined across all methadone or 
buprenorphine cohorts by using a bivariate random 
effects meta-analysis on log transformed mortality rates 
in both treatment periods.17-19 This bivariate meta-ana-
lytic approach allowed estimation of not only the 
pooled mortality rates and 95% confidence intervals in 
and out of treatment but also the pooled rate difference 
and rate ratio comparing periods out of and in 
 
treatment, with confidence intervals that took into 
account the correlation between rates in both treatment 
periods.
To evaluate whether cause specific mortality rates 
differed by baseline population characteristics, treat-
ment delivery, and follow-up features of methadone 
cohorts, we included the location (Europe/Israel, North 
America, or Australia), prevalence of opioid injection 
(<100 or 100%), percentage of men (<75 or ≥75%), mean 
age (<35 or ≥35), average methadone dose (≤80 or >80 
mg/day), percentage of inpatient induction (0 or >0%), 
treatment provider (specialist or general practitioner/
mixed), midpoint follow-up period (<2000 or ≥2000), 
and percentage loss to follow-up (<10 or ≥10%) in each 
methadone cohort as single predictors in separate 
bivariate random effects meta-regression models on log 
transformed mortality rates in and out of treatment.17 
18 
We contrasted heterogeneity of pooled mortality rates 
by these cohort characteristics through likelihood ratio 
tests comparing nested meta-regression models with 
and without the predictor fitted through maximum like-
lihood. The limited number of buprenorphine cohorts 
precluded a similar heterogeneity analysis across these 
cohorts.
For methadone or buprenorphine cohorts that 
reported mortality data by time interval in and out of 
treatment, we combined cause specific mortality rates 
before and after four weeks of treatment initiation and 
cessation through a multivariate random effects 
meta-analysis on log transformed mortality rates in 
these time-by-treatment intervals. To obtain pooled 
trends in all cause mortality risk over time in and out of 
methadone substitution treatment, we fitted a bivariate 
random effects meta-regression of log transformed 
rates on a quadratic linear spline function of log time 
with knot at four weeks.20 This quadratic linear spline 
allowed for a quadratic trend in the first four weeks in 
and out of treatment and forced the trend to be linear 
thereafter to avoid implausible shapes at long follow-up 
times. The resulting pooled trends were virtually 
 
insensitive to different knot locations at three, four, or 
five weeks.
We examined the overall heterogeneity in mortality 
rates across studies, as well as the residual heterogene-
ity beyond that explained by study level characteristics, 
with the multivariate extension of the Cochran χ2 test 
and quantified it with the extended I2 statistic,18 21 
 
which described the proportion of total variation in 
study specific mortality rates because of heterogeneity. 
The influence of each study on pooled estimates was 
evaluated by removal of each individual study from the 
analysis. Publication bias and genuine small study 
effects were assessed with the extended Egger test, 
allowing for heterogeneity.22 
23
In all the above multivariate random effects meta-an-
alytic models, we assumed the correlations within 
cohorts in the estimated mortality rates to be zero as 
they were obtained over different follow-up periods in 
and out of treatment. Nevertheless, we performed sen-
sitivity analyses assuming positive within cohort cor-
relations between mortality rates in and out of 
treatment of 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 0.95 for all studies, and 
the pooled rates and their standard errors were virtually 
identical to those obtained under uncorrelated rates 
within cohorts (changes of −1.3% to 1.6% in pooled 
rates and −5.7% to 7
.6% in standard errors). All models 
were fitted through restricted maximum likelihood 
methods with unstructured between cohort covariance 
matrix with the R package mvmeta (R Foundation for 
Statistical Computing). The estimated between cohort 
correlations in the underlying rates in and out of treat-
ment were 0.93 for all cause mortality and 0.81 for over-
dose mortality, with no estimation problems in any 
model regarding between cohort correlations at the 
boundary of the parameter space of 1.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for design or implementation of the 
study. No patients were asked to advise on interpreta-
tion or writing up on results. There are no plans to 
 
disseminate the results of the research to study partici-
pants or the relevant patient community.
Results
study characteristics
Of the 2033 distinct records identified through the 
search, we selected 19 cohort studies reported in 20 arti-
cles6-10 
24-38  (two articles27 
28  reported different mortality 
outcomes from the same cohort) that met the inclusion 
criteria and provided mortality data in people with opi-
oid dependence during and after opioid substitution 
treatment (fig 1 ). Tables 1 and 2  show the main charac-
teristics of selected cohorts. The studies were published 
between 1974 and 2016 and were all carried out in high 
income countries: 11 in Europe/Israel, four in North 
America, and four in Australia. There were mixed base-
line prevalences of opioid injection and HIV infection, 
except four cohorts that enrolled only opioid injectors, 
two of them further restricted to patients positive for 
HIV. All but four cohorts included patients with concur-
rent use of non-opioid drugs, with limited information

on psychiatric and medical comorbidities. More than 
70% of participants were men, and the mean age at 
baseline ranged from 23.4 to 39.6 (table 1).
Methadone was prescribed in 18 cohorts including 
122 885 participants over the period 1965-2010, and 
buprenorphine was used in three cohorts including 
15 831 participants over 1990-2010 (table 2). The average 
daily dose ranged from 47 mg to 116 mg of methadone 
and 10 mg to 12 mg of buprenorphine. Treatment was 
initiated on an ambulatory basis in all recent cohorts 
and provided by addiction medicine specialists in 11 
cohorts and general practitioners or mixed staff in eight 
cohorts. The average follow-up after initiation varied 
between 1.3 and 13.9 years for methadone and 1.1 and 
4.5 years for buprenorphine, with loss to follow-up 
exceeding 10% in only four cohorts. All cause mortality 
during follow-up periods in and out of treatment was 
reported in all but two methadone cohorts and over-
dose mortality in 11 methadone cohorts and one 
buprenorphine cohort. Most studies were of moderate 
quality. They ranged from 3 to 13 points on a 16 point 
scale, with a median of 8 points.
all cause mortality during and after opioid 
substitution treatment
All cause mortality rates varied widely across the 16 
methadone cohorts (overall I2=98%, P<0.001), although 
rates were consistently higher out of treatment than in 
treatment (fig 2 ). The pooled all cause mortality rates 
were 11.3 and 36.1 deaths per 1000 person years in and 
out of methadone treatment, respectively, with an 
unadjusted pooled rate difference for periods out and in 
treatment of 24.9 deaths (95% confidence interval 13.6 
to 36.1) per 1000 person years and an unadjusted 
pooled rate ratio of 3.20 (2.65 to 3.86). In heterogeneity 
analyses (table 3), the pooled all cause mortality rates 
in and out of methadone treatment were significantly 
higher in studies that mostly enrolled opioid injectors 
who were positive for HIV than in studies including 
both injectors and non-injectors, and marginally higher 
in studies conducted in Europe and North America than 
in Australia.
The pooled all cause mortality rates in the three 
buprenorphine cohorts were 4.3 and 9.5 deaths per 
1000 person years in and out of treatment, respectively 
(fig 2). The unadjusted pooled rate difference for peri-
ods out and in treatment was 5.2 deaths (95% confi-
dence interval −1.0 to 11.4) per 1000 person years and 
the unadjusted pooled rate ratio was 2.20 (1.34 to 3.61).
After we removed each individual cohort, the pooled 
all cause mortality rates ranged from 10.6 to 11.9 deaths 
per 1000 person years in methadone treatment and 
from 32.5 to 39.1 deaths per 1000 person years out of 
methadone treatment. With buprenorphine treatment 
these figures were 3.3 to 5.6 deaths and 7
.7 to 12.3 deaths 
per 1000 person years, respectively. There was some 
evidence of small study effects on all cause mortality 
(P=0.05), with higher rates in small cohorts that mostly 
enrolled opioid injectors who were positive for HIV 
(table 1  and fig 2).
Five methadone cohorts and one buprenorphine 
cohort reported all cause mortality rate ratios for peri-
ods out of and in treatment, with various degrees of 
adjustment for patient demographics, severity of drug 
use, treatment delivery, and comorbidity (table 4). After 
adjustment, out-to-in rate ratios remained unchanged 
in two methadone cohorts and increased by 15.5-35.5% 
in the other three methadone cohorts and by 16.8% in 
the buprenorphine cohort.
Overdose mortality during and after opioid 
substitution treatment
The pooled overdose mortality rates across the 11 meth-
adone cohorts were 2.6 and 12.7 overdose deaths per 
1000 person years in and out of methadone treatment, 
respectively (fig 3), with an unadjusted pooled rate dif-
ference comparing periods out and in treatment of 10.0 
overdose deaths (95% confidence interval 2.6 to 17
.4) per 
1000 person years and an unadjusted pooled rate ratio 
of 4.80 (2.90 to 7
.96). There was moderate heterogeneity 
between studies in mortality rates in treatment (I2=66%, 
P=0.001) and strong heterogeneity in rates out of treat-
ment (I2=97%, P<0.001), with significantly higher rates 
out of treatment among methadone patients in 
 
specialist services than in primary care (table 3 ). In the 
single buprenorphine cohort there were 1.4 and 4.6 fatal 
overdoses per 1000 person years in and out of treatment 
(fig 3).
After we removed each methadone cohort, the pooled 
overdose mortality rates varied between 2.4 and 2.8 
fatal overdoses per 1000 person years in methadone 
treatment and between 10.6 and 14.9 fatal overdoses per 
1000 person years out of treatment. There was no evi-
dence of publication bias or other small study effects on 
overdose mortality (P=0.14). Adjustment for potential 
confounders did not produce any change in overdose 
mortality rate ratios for periods out compared with in 
treatment in three methadone cohorts, but resulted in 
25.8% and 28.6% larger rate ratios in two other metha-
done cohorts (table 4).

all cause mortality by time interval in and out 
of treatment
Six recent methadone cohorts provided all cause mortal-
ity data disaggregated by time interval in and out of treat-
ment (fig 4). After we excluded a selective high risk cohort 
of injectors who were HIV positive and received highly 
active antiretroviral therapy, the pooled all cause mortal-
ity rates were 11.4 and 5.8 deaths per 1000 person years in 
the first four weeks and the remaining time on metha-
done treatment, respectively, with an unadjusted pooled 
rate difference for initial compared with subsequent treat-
ment periods of 5.6 deaths (95% confidence interval −2.4 
to 13.6) per 1000 person years and an unadjusted pooled 
rate ratio of 1.97 (0.94 to 4.10). Similarly, the pooled all 
cause mortality dropped from 32.1 deaths per 1000 person 
years in the first four weeks after stopping methadone 
treatment to 13.5 deaths per 1000 person years thereafter, 
resulting in an unadjusted pooled rate difference for ini-
tial compared with subsequent periods out of treatment 
of 18.6 deaths (2.9 to 34.3) per 1000 person years and an 
unadjusted pooled rate ratio of 2.38 (1.51 to 3.74).
In continuous time trend analysis (fig 5), there were 
significant departures from linearity in trends in all 
cause mortality risk over time in and out of methadone 
treatment (P=0.04). The pooled all cause mortality rates 
decreased sharply from 37
.4 to 6.4 deaths per 1000 per-
son years throughout the initial four weeks of metha-
done treatment and were fairly stable thereafter. In 
contrast, after people left methadone treatment, the 
pooled all cause mortality remained high at between 
24.1 and 35.2 deaths per 1000 person years during the 
initial two weeks out of treatment and decreased pro-
gressively afterwards.
In the two buprenorphine cohorts reporting disaggre-
gated data, the pooled all cause mortality remained 
equally low at 4.5 deaths per 1000 person years during 
and after the first four weeks of buprenorphine treat-
ment (fig 4). The pooled all cause mortality, however, 
increased to 32.0 deaths per 1000 person years in the 
first four weeks after people stopped buprenorphine 
treatment and reduced thereafter to 10.9 deaths per 
1000 person years, with an unadjusted pooled rate dif-
ference for initial compared with subsequent periods 
out of treatment of 21.2 deaths (95% confidence interval 
−5.9 to 48.2) per 1000 person years and an unadjusted 
pooled rate ratio of 2.94 (1.34 to 6.46).
Overdose mortality by time interval in and out of 
treatment
Only three methadone cohorts and one buprenorphine 
cohort reported overdose mortality by time interval (fig 
6). The pooled overdose mortality rates were 3.5 and 2.0 
overdose deaths per 1000 person years in the first four 
weeks and the rest of time on methadone treatment and 
4.2 and 3.4 overdose deaths per 1000 person years 
during and after the first four weeks out of treatment. In

discussion
Main findings
Our review suggests that time spent in opioid substitu-
tion treatment with methadone is associated with an 
average reduction of 25 deaths/1000 person years (95% 
confidence interval 14 to 36). The rate in treatment was 
less than a third of the rate out of treatment, with the 
greatest difference in deaths from overdose. The all 
cause mortality risk during treatment is much higher in 
the first four weeks than in the remainder of treatment. 
Mortality risk is also higher in the first four weeks after 
cessation than in the remainder time out of treatment.
Based on three cohorts (two from Australia), findings 
also suggest that opioid substitution treatment with 
buprenorphine could be associated with a reduction in 
mortality, with a similar risk across all time in treatment 
(about four deaths/1000 person years) consistent with 
its safety profile,39-44 and a risk after cessation higher in 
the first four weeks than in the remainder of time out of 
treatment (32 versus 11 deaths/1000 person years).
Mortality risk during specific periods in and out of 
methadone treatment
The larger relative effect size (as measured by rate ratio) 
for overdose than non-overdose deaths with metha-
done substitution6 11 34 45  is consistent with previous 
findings, although the effect on non-overdose deaths 
had not been previously reviewed. This disparity is 
 
consistent with what would be expected given metha-
done’s effect on reducing use of heroin and other illicit 
 
opioids.32 
34
Our finding that the first four weeks after onset (11.4 
deaths/1000 person years) and cessation (32.1/1000 
person years) of methadone treatment are the highest 
risk periods suggests that these are key periods during 
which to focus efforts for prevention of drug related 
deaths. Moreover, within periods of methadone treat-
ment there is a swift decline in risk from first to fourth 
week, followed by a stable trend, whereas after cessa-
tion there is a high but quite stable risk during the first 
four weeks and a progressive decline afterward. This is 
important because some patients cycle in and out of 
opioid substitution treatment46-50  and are therefore 
exposed to repeated periods of high risk for mortality. 
Such changes probably mainly reflect changes in risk of 
fatal overdose,6 32  but this has not been accurately 
assessed because only two cohorts reported overdose 
data specifically.7 
10  The increased risk during the first 
few weeks of treatment could be explained by an accu-
mulation of methadone that exceeds the opioid toler-
ance level (the mean elimination half life for methadone 
is 22 hours),51  as opioid tolerance does not seem to fully 
protect against respiratory depression.52  Psychological 
factors and concomitant use of other respiratory 
depressant drugs or cocaine could also play a 
role.7

Although the long half life of methadone could con-
tribute to the increase in mortality in the first three to 
four days after cessation of treatment, there was a large 
increase in mortality across the first four weeks after 
cessation compared with the treatment period. Such 
increased mortality could be explained by loss of toler-
ance to the toxic effects of heroin, assuming that many 
patients return to use,6 8 32 47 55 56  and probably also by 
the use of multiple legal and illicit substances during 
that period. Similar peaks in drug related mortality 
occur in other situations where opioid tolerance is prob-
ably diminished (for example, after prison release or 
hospital discharge57-59 ). Lifestyle factors and comorbid 
issues such as mental health problems could also 
increase mortality from other external causes, as deaths 
from suicide and injury are also more common during 
that period.53
Mortality risk during specific periods in and out of 
buprenorphine treatment
Data from three cohorts (two from Australia) suggest 
that substitution treatment with buprenorphine could 
reduce all cause mortality, although the disparity in 
mortality rates in periods in and out of treatment did 
not reach significance. Findings also suggest a signifi-
cantly increased mortality in the first four weeks after 
cessation of treatment compared with the remaining 
time out of treatment (32.0 versus 10.9/1000 person 
years), while during the treatment period there was no 
difference between the first four weeks and the remain-
ing time in treatment. It is difficult to draw firm conclu-
sions because of limited evidence from similar settings: 
96% of included deaths and 98% of person years came 
from Australian studies (with 87% and 86% from the 
study by Kimber and colleagues13).
Comparative effectiveness of buprenorphine and 
methadone substitution treatment
Other sources of data have suggested that buprenor-
phine could be more effective than methadone in reduc-
ing mortality, especially from overdose.39 42 43  Unlike 
methadone, there is a ceiling for respiratory depressant 
effects of buprenorphine as dose increases, and the 
probability of triggering arrhythmias is lower for 
buprenorphine than methadone.41 44 60 When we com-
pared the mortality between periods in and out of treat-
ment, first within those taking methadone and then 
within those taking buprenorphine, we found a greater 
reduction in mortality with methadone than with 
buprenorphine (measured as the rate difference or rate 
ratio between periods). When we compared mortality 
between them, first within the treatment period and 
then in the period off treatment, we found a signifi-
cantly lower mortality with buprenorphine than meth-
adone in both periods.
Our conclusions must remain tentative until further 
studies in varied treatment settings and contexts are 
undertaken to examine this issue. Differences in mor-
tality might also reflect confounding through differ-
ences in characteristics of patients (such as age, 
severity of opioid dependence, injecting drug use, other

tory, patient’s preference); characteristics of treatment 
(such as previous treatment, specialisation of the doc-
tor who controls the treatment, dose, provision charac-
teristics, cointerventions, retention, or drop outs), or 
the sociopolitical context in which studies have been 
conducted. For example, the initial prognosis might be 
better in those given buprenorphine than those given 
methadone (that is, fewer comorbid problems, less 
severe opioid dependence),6 8 10 61  though this was not 
clearly found in a recent US study.62
The role of such confounding factors has received 
almost empirical examination. Few details on char-
acteristics of patients or treatments were reported in 
 
articles included in this meta-analysis to permit a 
detailed examination of this potential issue (tables 1 
and 2 ), so it was not possible to assess the possibil-
ity of confounding. A sensitivity simulation analysis 
in the study by Kimber and colleagues, however, 
suggested that the lower mortality with buprenor-
phine than with methadone during first four weeks 
of treatment was unlikely to be caused by unmea-
sured confounding.10
strengths and limitations
This meta-analysis synthesised evidence from cohort 
studies published until 2016 on risk of mortality in 
 
people who are dependent on opioids during and after 
opioid substitution treatment, separately for buprenor-
phine and methadone. Mortality changes over time 
(1st-32th week) during and after methadone are care-
fully quantified for the first time.

methodological shortcomings. Firstly, in the included

observational studies, the same patients are compared 
throughout follow-up periods in and out of opioid sub-
stitution treatment, but these patients leave and re-en-
ter treatment in a non-random way and hence there 
could still be a large potential for confounding in com-
parisons of crude mortality risk in and out of treat-
ment. In some studies with diverse information on 
patient demographics, severity of drug use, and comor-
bidities measured mostly at baseline (table 3 ), adjust-
ment for these potential confounders resulted in 
similar or even increased out-to-in mortality rate ratios, 
which merely reflects that the above conditions tended 
to be less prevalent at baseline among patients who 
later left or were discharged from treatment than those 
who remained in treatment. Nevertheless, to obtain an 
unbiased estimate of the preventive effect of opioid 
substitution treatment on all cause and overdose mor-
tality, these and other relevant confounders should be 
measured every time a patient leaves and resumes 
treatment. Time varying data can then be used to 
adjust for confounder history in standard regression 
models or, even better, to construct inverse probability 
of treatment weights for marginal structural models,63 
 
which properly control for time varying confounders 
for later treatment that are themselves affected by pre-
vious treatment, such as severity of drug use and 
comorbidity. Also, differential loss to follow-up is a 
concern in the meta-analysed cohorts as dropouts are 
more likely to occur in patients at higher risk of death 
during periods out of treatment, thus inducing a selec-
tion bias in crude comparisons of out-to-in mortality 
risk because of informative censoring. Marginal struc-
tural models with inverse probability of censoring 
weights can also be used to correct for differential loss 
to follow-up,63 provided that common predictors of 
death and censoring are measured over time. In sum-
mary, individual cohorts are prone to confounding and 
selection bias because of differential loss to follow-up, 
but it is hard to assess with the available information 
the amount and direction of bias projected onto the 
pooled mortality rate differences and rate ratios 
between periods in and out of treatment obtained in 
this meta-analysis.
Secondly, studies were conducted in high income 
countries, with the follow-up often spread over many 
calendar years (1965-2010 for methadone and 1990-2010 
for buprenorphine) and a highly variable average 
length of follow-up (ranges 1.3-15.8 years and 1.1-4.5 
years, respectively). Studies in low and middle income 
countries are especially needed.
Thirdly, by design, we have not captured overdose 
mortality when opioid substitution treatment was 
obtained on illicit drug markets.40 
64  Fourthly, a delayed 
record of treatment cessation could have led to some 
deaths that occurred out of treatment being incorrectly 
classified as occurring in treatment40 ; if so, this makes 
our estimated impact of opioid substitution treatment 
on mortality a conservative one. There could similarly 
be misclassification between overdose and non-over-
dose deaths because of inconsistencies in definition of 
overdose and codification of causes of deaths (for 
instance, criteria for separating overdose death from 
intentional poisoning or sudden cardiac death)40 65; 
again, these misclassifications would tend to underesti-
mate deaths from overdose.
implications for policy and practice
In many countries the number of deaths attributable to 
opioid use is substantial66 67  and increasing in some 
such as the US, where deaths from opioid overdose now 
outnumber gun related deaths in the country.68 Over-
doses are preventable causes of death warranting wide 
implementation of preventive interventions. Our review 
has provided evidence that methadone and probably 
buprenorphine reduce mortality among people depen-
dent on opioids, making it imperative that further 
research confirms this using study designs that con-
sider a wide range of confounding variables to increase 
confidence that these effects are causal.
It must be borne in mind that there is strong evidence 
of the efficacy of methadone and buprenorphine on a 
range of clinical outcomes, and these medicines are 
listed as WHO essential medicines; the findings we 
have presented here provide additional imperatives for 
their widespread availability. Despite this, coverage of 
opioid substitution treatment is low in many countries 
worldwide.69 Policymakers, clinicians, and those 
responsible for drug treatment systems should work to 
ensure the availability of such treatment, remove access 
barriers, and promote engagement. This means the 
strategic development of services from a public health 
perspective, which could reduce the social harm associ-
ated with opioid use.
Our review suggests that some precautions should be 
taken during and after opioid substitution treatment to 
increase safety. Firstly, careful clinical assessment of 
opioid tolerance before onset of treatment to establish a 
safe induction dose seems warranted. Secondly, moni-
toring during the induction period is important, espe-
cially for methadone, with clinicians considering 
adjusting opioid doses, monitoring mental and somatic 
problems, and preventing the use of opioids obtained 
on the illicit drug market.64  In addition, education of 
patients about the risk of overdose risk and use of “take 
home” naloxone70 71  is warranted. Buprenorphine 
induction followed by transition to methadone might 
also be considered.10 
72 Retention in opioid substitution 
treatment reduces risk of exposure to mortality after 
cessation and also to re-exposure to mortality risk 
during induction onto methadone, so efforts to improve 
retention are important as a strategy to reduce mortal-
ity. More generally, establishment of mechanisms for 
information and coordination between healthcare, 
social and legal services, and patient counselling while 
in treatment, in addition to more specific overdose pre-
vention programmes such as naloxone distribution, 
should be considered.
Finally, there is a pressing need for new studies on 
the comparative effectiveness of methadone and 
buprenorphine in reducing mortality. New ran-
domised controlled trials are highly unlikely: they

implement. A more pragmatic solution is to conduct 
cohort studies in multiple countries, including both 
methadone and buprenorphine patients, with hetero-
geneous characteristics, and sufficient information on 
potential confounders. These studies could focus on 
the relation between time in treatment and risks after 
interruption of treatment to identify a minimum 
requirement for treatment duration to observe reduc-
tions in mortality risk.
