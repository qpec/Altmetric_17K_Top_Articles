INTRODUCTION: Microglia play essential roles
in central nervous system homeostasis and in-
fluence diverse aspects of neuronal function,
including refinement of synaptic networks and
elaboration of neuromodulatory factors for
memory and motor learning. Many lines of
evidence indicate that dysregulation of microg-
lial functions contributes to the pathogenesis
of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alz-
heimer’sdiseaseandParkinson’sdisease.Emerging
evidence from mouse and human studies also sug-
gests that microglia influence neurodevel-
opmental and psychiatric disorders such
as schizophrenia and depression. Most dis-
easeriskallelesassociatedwithneurodegen-

mouse brain environment strongly influ-
ences microglia-specific gene expression
has implications for understanding path-
ogenic responses of microglia in diseases
and disorders and modeling their pheno-
types in vitro.
RATIONALE: Although dysregulation of
microglial activity is genetically linked to
neurodegenerativediseasesandpsychiatric
disorders, no systematic evaluations of hu-
man microglia gene expression or regu-
latory landscapes are currently available.
In addition, the extent to which mice pro-
vide suitable models for human microglia
is unclear. The major goals of this study
were to define the transcriptomes and
DNA regulatory elements of human mi-
croglia ex vivo and in vitro in comparison
to the mouse and to systematically relate
these features to expression of genes asso-
ciated with genome-wide associationstudy
(GWAS) risk alleles or exhibiting altered
expression in neurodegenerative diseases
and psychiatric disorders.
RESULTS: We used RNA sequencing, chro-
matin immunoprecipitation sequencing, and
assay for transposase-accessible chromatin
sequencing to characterize the transcriptomes
and epigenetic landscapes of human microg-
lia isolated from surgically resected brain tis-
sue in excess of that needed for diagnosis.
Although some effects of underlying disease
cannot be excluded, the overall pattern of gene
expression was markedly consistent. Microglia-
enriched genes were found to overlap signif-
icantly with genes exhibiting altered expression
in neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric
disorders and with genes associated with a wide
spectrum of disease-specific risk alleles. Human
microglia gene expression was well correlated
with mouse microglia gene
expression, but numerous
species-specific differences
were also observed that
included genes linked to
human disease. More than
half of the genes associ-
ated with noncoding GWAS risk alleles for
Alzheimer’s disease are preferentially expressed
in microglia. DNA recognition motifs enriched
at active enhancers and expression of the cor-
responding lineage-determining transcription
factors were very similar for human and mouse
microglia. Transition of human and mouse mi-
croglia from the brain to tissue culture revealed
remodeling of their respective enhancer land-
scapes and extensive down-regulation of genes
that are induced in primitive mouse macro-
phages following migration into the fetal brain.
Treatment of microglia in vitro with trans-
forming growth factor b1 (TGF-b1) had rel-
atively modest effects in maintaining the
ex vivo pattern of gene expression. A signif-
icant subset of the genes up- or down-regulated
in vitro exhibited altered expression in neu-
rodegenerative diseases and psychiatric
disorders.
CONCLUSION: These studies identify
core features of human microglial tran-
scriptomes and epigenetic landscapes. In-
tersection of the microglia-specific gene
signature with GWAS and transcriptomic
data supports roles of microglia as both
responders and contributors to disease
phenotypes. The identification of an
environment-sensitive program of gene
expression and corresponding regulatory
elements enables inference of a conserved
and dynamic transcription factor network
that maintains microglia identity and
function. The combinations of signaling
factors in the brain necessary to maintain
microglia phenotypes remain largely un-
known. In concert, these findings will
inform efforts to generate microglia-like
cells in simple and complex culture sys-
tems and understand gene-environment
interactions that influence homeostatic
and pathogenic functions of microglia in
the human brain.▪

Brain environment specifies gene expression in
microglia. Human microglia transcriptomes and
enhancer landscapes were defined ex vivo following
purification from surgically resected brain tissue and
in vitro after transfer to a tissue culture environment.
Dynamic changes in these features enabled delineation
of transcription factors controlling an environment-

Microglia play essential roles in central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis and influence
diverse aspects of neuronal function. However, the transcriptional mechanisms that
specify human microglia phenotypes are largely unknown. We examined the
transcriptomes and epigenetic landscapes of human microglia isolated from surgically
resected brain tissue ex vivo and after transition to an in vitro environment. Transfer to a
tissue culture environment resulted in rapid and extensive down-regulation of microglia-
specific genes that were induced in primitive mouse macrophages after migration into the
fetal brain. Substantial subsets of these genes exhibited altered expression in
neurodegenerative and behavioral diseases and were associated with noncoding risk
variants. These findings reveal an environment-dependent transcriptional network
specifying microglia-specific programs of gene expression and facilitate efforts to
understand the roles of microglia in human brain diseases.
M
icroglia are the resident macrophage
population of the central nervous system
(CNS) that perform functions required
for typical development, as well as ho-
meostasis, plasticity, immunity, andrepair
(1–5). Dysregulation of microglia functions con-
tributes to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative
diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (6–8),
Parkinson’s disease (PD) (9–12), and Huntington’s
disease (HD) (13–15). In addition, microglia may
play roles in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric
diseases such as autism, schizophrenia (Scz), and
depression (16, 17). Collectively, these observations
provide a compelling incentive to define the mech-
anisms that control microglia functions and to
investigate the potential to alter these functions
for therapeutic purposes.
Microglia possess distinctive ontogeny, mor-
phology, gene expression patterns, and functional
characteristics and account for 5 to 20% of all
glial cells, depending on brain region. Studies
in mice indicate that microglia are derived from
yolk sac progenitor cells that populate the brain
early in development (18, 19). Microglia share
many traits with other subsets of tissue-resident
macrophages, including dependence on the CSF1
receptor for differentiation and survival (18, 20),
a requirement for PU.1 as an essential lineage-
determining transcription factor (LDTF) (21, 22),
highly efficient phagocytic and tissue debris clear-
ance abilities (2, 5), and the ability to quickly trig-
ger an inflammatory response following detection
of pathogens or tissue damage (23).
Microglia also express hundreds of genes at
higher levels than other macrophage subsets
(24–26) that may be influenced by factors present
in the CNS microenvironment (25, 27), suggest-
ing mechanisms by which the brain environment
influences the activity and functions of one of its
primary support cells. As microglia participate in
the developmental refinement of synaptic net-
works (28) and elaborate neuromodulatory fac-
tors for adult motor learning (29), alterations in
the brain microenvironment may lead to patho-
genic programs of gene expression in microglia.
Insights into mechanisms that control the
development and function of specific cell types
can be obtained by analyses of their enhancer
repertoires and corresponding epigenetic land-
scapes (30). Microglial enhancers are primed by
relatively simple combinations of LDTFs (31, 32)
to become sites of activity of broadly expressed
signal-dependent transcription factors (SDTFs).
These enhancers thereby integrate cellular signal-
ing pathways with DNA. Within cell-specific
enhancers, DNA sequences provide information
about the identities of key LDTFs and the activity
states of signaling pathways that control the
functions of SDTFs (31, 33–35). Furthermore,
the locations and sequence content of enhancers
provide insights into how noncoding genetic
variation may affect gene expression and cellular
phenotypes (32, 36–38).
Human microglia transcriptomes
Microglia were isolated from brain tissue resected
for treatment of epilepsy, brain tumors, or acute
ischemic events in 19 individuals. Patient charac-
teristics, medications, and assays performed for
each sample are provided in table S1. For patients
with epilepsy, the resected tissue provided did not
include the brain area displaying the strongest
epileptogenic activity. Although most specimens
from individuals with epilepsy exhibited some
degree of cortical dysplasia, three samples were
determinedtobehistologicallynormal.Forpatients
with brain tumors (8), samples were considered
to be tumor negative by pathological examination.
The two brain samples resected to treat acute
ischemic injuries were from individuals who had
no prior evidence of brain pathology. As judged
by neuropathological diagnostic evaluation, none
of the samples displayed evidence of pathological
microgliosis (i.e., loss of tiled distribution, pro-
cess retraction, and enlarged cell bodies) despite
the occasional presence of reactive cells (fig. S1).
Tissues were immediately placed on ice in the
operating room and processed for microglia iso-
lation within a few hours of surgical resection
(25). A microglia-rich cell fraction was isolated by
Percoll gradient centrifugation and further puri-
fied by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, with final
gating on live-CD11b+CD45LowCD64+CX3CR1High
single cells (fig. S2A). This strategy excluded cells
expressing moderate to high levels of CD45, which
were present in variable amounts depending on
the specific sample (fig. S2A). Microglia were then
triaged to specific analysis workflows depending
on yields and depth of existing data sets (table S1).
For five individuals, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)
was also performed from a portion of the intact
cortical brain tissue used to isolate microglia (here-
after referred to as “cortex”).
Isolated microglia exhibited a high degree of
viability and RNA integrity. In one case, brain
tissue was simultaneously obtained from the
occipital and parietal lobes of the same individ-
ual, enabling independent isolation of microglia
from each region. RNA expression levels for these
two samples exhibited a Pearson correlation co-
efficient of 0.929 (fig. S3A). In a second case, an
individualunderwentsequentialsurgicalresections
approximately 1 year apart. The RNA expression
levels in microglia obtained from this individual
at these two time points exhibited a Pearson cor-
relation coefficient of 0.905 (fig. S3B). On the basis
of these observations, the variance in gene expres-
sion noted in these samples likely overestimates

plies a high degree of precision inthe RNA-seqdata
set. Comparisons of the RNA-seq profiles of any
two individuals for genes expressed >2 log2 tran-
scripts per million (TPM) yielded Pearson corre-
lation coefficients of ~0.8, as exemplified by a
comparison of microglia isolated from a 1-year-old
female patient diagnosed with atypical rhabdoid
tumor to microglia isolated from a 7-year-old
female patient with epilepsy (fig. S3C). When all
transcripts were considered (i.e., including genes
expressed at ≤2 log2 TPM), Pearson correlation
coefficients were in the range of 0.94 to 0.98 (fig.
S3D), indicating no substantial outliers among
samples. RNA-seq data indicated low-to-absent
levels of neuronal, astrocyte, oligodendrocyte, and
endothelial-specificgenes,confirminginsignificant
levels of contaminating cells (fig. S2B and table S2).
Hierarchical clustering of expressed genes from
all microglia samples in comparison to cortex is
illustrated in Fig. 1A. Although there are likely
to be alterations in gene expression related to
disease, no strong patterns emerged that were
related to diagnosis or age (Fig. 1A), perhaps due
in part to exclusion of most reactive cells at the
time of sorting (fig. S2A). A small set of genes
exhibited significant sex-specific differences in
gene expression, and these were mostly related
to X- and Y-linked genes (fig. S4). Relative ex-
pression values for the 30 most highly expressed
genes across each of the patients are illustrated
in Fig. 1B, indicating substantial individual var-
iation for some transcripts. This analysis con-
firmed that human microglia expressed very high
levels of numerous genes associated with regu-
lation of microglia ramification and motility,

tors C3, C1QA, C1QB, and C1QC (table S2).
Nearly all studies of differentially regulated
genes in human neurodegenerative or behav-
ioral disorders are based on RNA profiling of
intact tissues. As gene expression profiles for
individual cell types in the human brain are poor-
ly characterized, it is difficult to assign cell types
responsible for disease-related changes. Using a
stringent cutoff of 10-fold–increased expression
relative to cortex tissue at a false discovery rate
(FDR) of 0.05, we defined a microglial gene signa-
ture in the human brain comprising 881 tran-
scripts (Fig. 1A and table S2). We then intersected
this gene list with 46 publicly available data sets
for differentially regulated genes in neurodegen-
erative and behavioral disorders derived from
microarray or RNA-seq analysis of intact tissue
(39–53). Two-sided Fisher’s exact tests revealed
significant enrichment or depletion of microg-
lia signature genes in 28 of the 46 data sets
(table S3). For example, hundreds of genes in
the microglia gene signature exhibited signif-
icant overlaps with sets of genes that were posi-
tively correlated with Braak stage in AD, were
up-regulated in frontotemporal lobar degenera-
tion (FTLD) in frontal cortex, were up-regulated
inHIV-associatedneurocognitivedisorder(HAND),
or were up-regulated in Scz (Fig. 1C). Notably,
different subsets of the microglia signature gene
set were up-regulated or down-regulated in cor-
tex in PD (Fig. 1C).

evaluation of the relative expression levels of genes
associated with AD, PD, multiple sclerosis (MS),
and Scz risk alleles (54). Many of these genes were
preferentially expressed in microglia, with the rela-
tive proportion varying by disorder (Fig. 1D and
fig. S5). With respect to AD, for example, expres-
sion for 28 of 48 AD genes was higher in microglia,
including TREM2, SORL1, INPP5D, MEF2C, and
CD33 (Fig. 1E). For MS, 48 of 81 genes associated
with risk alleles were preferentially expressed in
microglia (fig. S5). By contrast, approximately one-
third of the genes associated with PD and Scz risk
alleles exhibited preferential expression in microg-
lia (fig. S5). As the risk alleles for these disorders
are largely nonoverlapping, these findings sug-
gest different roles for microglia in each disorder

 Notable examples included higher expression
in human microglia of regulators of the comple-
ment system (e.g., C2, C3, VSIG4, SERPING1) and
genes involved in brain structure development,
includingSYNDIG1,GLDN,CTTNBP2, andROBO3.
By contrast, genes more highly expressed in mouse
microglia included Hexb, Sparc, and Sall3. Of
the subset of these genes that also exhibited
microglia-specific expression, a similar species-
specific pattern of expression was observed in
the intact cortical tissue used for microglia iso-
lation, indicating that these differences were not
a consequence of the isolation procedure (fig. S7).
We compared the levels of mRNA transcripts
in C57BL/6 microglia with different tissue-resident
macrophage populations (26, 56) and observed
900 mRNAs with levels of expression in microg-
lia that were 10-fold greater than the integrated
mean of expression levels in the other macro-
phage subsets at a FDR of 0.05 (Fig. 2B). This def-
inition captures a mouse microglia gene signature
set that is larger but mostly inclusive of previously
described microglia signature sets (27, 57, 58). Gene
ontology analysis of this extended microglia gene
signature returned significant functional enrich-
ment for CNS-related categories such as regulation
of neurogenesis, synaptic signaling, CNS devel-
opment, response to transforming growth factor
beta (TGF-b), and regulation of neurotransmitter
transport (Fig. 2C). RNA-seq data sets are not
available for a sufficient number of human res-
ident macrophage populations to generate a cor-
responding human microglia signature gene list.
However, the relative expression levels of the hu-
man and mouse orthologous genes corresponding
to the mouse microglia signature genes revealed
that ~53% (477 of 900) of the genes that were
highly specific to microglia in the mouse were ex-
pressed at comparable levels in human microg-
lia (Fig. 2D).
Comparing the expression of genes linked to
human neurodegenerative and behavioral dis-
orders, of the 39 AD-associated and expressed
genes, 11 were higher in human microglia whereas
three were increased in mouse microglia (Fig. 2E).
Notably, of the top 25 most expressed, two genes,
APOC1 and MPZL1, were essentially not expressed
in C57BL/6 microglia; the expression of a third
one, SORL1, was nearly 20 times lower in mice
than in humans (Fig. 2F). PD-associated genes
also displayed similar human versus mouse dis-
tributions (fig. S8). PD-associated genes SNCA,
LRRK2, CD46, and CXCL12 were expressed to a
greater extent in human microglia than in mouse
microglia. Corresponding comparisons for all
expressed genes linked to AD, PD, MS, and Scz
are illustrated in fig. S8. Collectively, these results
highlight human versus mouse similarities and
differences in the expressionprofile of core microg-
lia genes.
Enhancer landscape of human microglia
We performed assay for transposase-accessible
chromatin–sequencing (ATAC-seq) to define open
regions of chromatin and chromatin immunopre-
cipitation–sequencing (ChIP-seq) for histone H3
lysine 4 dimethylation (H3K4me2) and histone
H3lysine27acetylation(H3K27ac)todefineregions
of poised/active and active chromatin, respectively,
inbothhumanandmousemicroglia. MouseATAC-
seq data were aligned with previous H3K4me2
and H3K27ac data (25). ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq
data were highly correlated across human indi-
viduals and mouse biological replicates (fig. S9). A
representative University of California Santa Cruz
(UCSC) genome browser track for human microglia
data in the vicinity of the BIN1 gene is illustrated in
Fig. 3A, and for CX3CR1 and TREM2 in fig. S10A.
rs6733839 is a noncoding risk allele for AD (59) that
lieswithinanenhancer-likeregion~25kbupstream
of the BIN1 transcriptional start site, suggesting
regulatory function. De novo motif analysis of
ATAC-seq peaks associated with H3K4me2 was
performed to identify the most highly enriched
transcription factor recognition motifs associated
with poised or active chromatin. These analyses
returned very similar motifs for both mouse and
human microglia. A dominant signature was ob-
served for PU.1 in both species, with highly signif-
icant enrichment also observed for motifs assigned
to CTCF, IRF, RUNX, MEF2, C/EBP, AP-1,SMAD,
and MAF factors (Fig. 3B and fig. S10B).
Expression levels of transcription factors re-
cognizing the motifs identified in Fig. 3B are
illustrated in Fig. 3C. SPI1 (encoding PU.1) was
the most highly expressed ETS domain tran-
scription factor, and the top motifs were nearly
perfect matches for its consensus recognition
sequence. The assignment of the second-most
enriched motif to CTCF was unexpected because
CTCF is ubiquitously expressed and is thought
to primarily play roles in the organization of
broad domains of chromatin architecture. How-
ever, the identified motif was a near-perfect match
for the CTCF consensus recognition site, and
CTCF was the only transcription factor expressed
in microglia known to recognize this motif. By
contrast, the remaining motifs were clearly recog-
nized by multiple related members of transcrip-
tion factor families that were reliably coexpressed
in microglia.
We used H3K27ac as a means of identifying
super-enhancers (SEs), which are regions of the
genome exhibiting a disproportionately high den-
sity of active regulatory marks and transcription
factor binding (60–62). Common SEs were asso-
ciated with genes that are known to play essential
roles in the development and function of virtual-
ly all macrophages, whereas mouse microglia-
specific SEs were associated with genes known
to play restricted or selected roles in this cell type
(25). Corresponding analysis of the H3K27acHigh
regions in human microglia identified ~700 SEs
that were also associated with active regions of
the genome overlapping or in close proximity to
genes highly expressed in or specific to microglia,
including CX3CR1, P2RY12, and TMEM119 (table
S6). The intersection of transcription factor genes
associated with SEs in human and mouse microg-
lia captured many of the transcription factors illus-
trated in Fig. 3C. An additional 35 factors were
associated with SEs, some of which have been
linked to functional roles in microglia, includ-
ing SALL1, STAT3, and RELA (Fig. 3D). These
factors also exhibited similar expression levels
in mouse and human microglia.
Evaluation of mRNAs annotated as encod-
ing orthologous transcription factors indicated
similar expression levels in human and mouse
for the great majority. However, using a 10-fold
cutoff at an FDR of 0.05, 20 factors were pref-
erentially expressed in human microglia, includ-
ing CIITA, RUNX2, EGR3, and NR4A2. By contrast,
16 factors were preferentially expressed in mouse
microglia, including Sall3 and Smad1 (Fig. 3E).
To establish the relationship between enriched
motifs and actual transcription factor binding,
we performed ChIP-seq for PU.1 in microglia
isolated from six individuals. These experiments
yielded a highly consistent pattern of genomic
binding (Fig. 3A and fig. S10A), with PU.1 being
localized at 51.2% of ATAC-seq–defined regions
of open chromatin associated with H3K4me2
and at 60.9% of regions exhibiting these features
plus H3K27ac. De novo motif enrichment anal-
ysis identified the PU.1 motif as the top hit, fol-
lowed by motifs for IRF, AP-1, MEF2, C/EBP, and
RUNX (Fig. 3B and fig. S10B). Similar results
were observed for Pu.1 binding sites in mouse
microglia. The frequency distribution of many of
these motifs is consistent with the corresponding
transcription factors forming ternary complexes
with PU.1 (e.g., the IRF motif; fig. S10C) or func-
tioning as collaborative binding partners (e.g.,
CTCF, AP-1, and RUNX motifs; fig. S10C).
We also investigated the relationships between
PU.1 binding, open chromatin, and H3K27ac for
genes that are highly differentially expressed
between human and mouse microglia. H3K27ac
at promoters was strongly correlated with differ-
ential gene expression (Fig. 3F). Differential gene
expression and H3K27ac were also associated with
species-specific PU.1 binding and ATAC-seq signal
exemplified by the SALL1, SPARC, VSIG4, and
APOC1 loci (fig. S11). Collectively, these findings
provide evidence that the transcriptional mech-
anisms that control gene expression are largely
conserved between human and mouse microglia
and that differences in gene expression are pri-
marily driven by species-specific organization of
cis-regulatory elements at target genes. However,
as a small number of transcription factors thought
to play important roles in microglia are diver-
gently expressed, such as CIITA and RUNX2 pro-
teins, there is also the potential for trans effects
at the subsets of genes regulated by these factors.
Alterations of the human microglia
transcriptome in vitro
Tissue environment has emerged as an impor-
tant determinant of microglia identity, but many
studies of microglia are performed in vitro. Trans-
criptomic analysis of mouse microglia transferred
to a tissue culture environment for 7 days docu-
mented significant changes in expression of hun-
dreds of genes, with a preferential reduction in
expression of microglia-specific genes (25). Sim-
ilar to what was observed with mouse microglia,
transfer of human microglia to the in vitro envi-
ronment resulted in significant changes in the
expression of thousands of genes. Responses of

 human microglia isolated from different indi-
viduals to the in vitro environment were concor-
dant (Fig. 4A, iv). For the individuals with both
ex vivo and in vitro samples available, gene ex-
pression within culture conditions (mean Pear-
son correlation = 0.95) was more correlated (P =
0.008 by permutation test) than between the ex
vivo and in vitro samples of the same individual
(mean Pearson correlation = 0.89). A paired anal-
ysis of samples for which both ex vivo and 7-day
in vitro microglia populations were obtained re-
vealed more than 300 genes that were induced
greater than 10-fold and more than 700 genes
that were repressed more than 10-fold in vitro
(FDR 0.05). At a twofold cutoff, 2263 genes were
up-regulated in vitro and 3702 genes were down-
regulated at a FDR of 0.05. Thirty-three percent
of the conserved signature gene set and 31% of
the genes associated with AD risk variants exhib-
ited >2-fold reduction in expression in vitro (Figs.
4, B to D). A similar proportion (30%) of genes
associated with PD also displayed such reduc-
tion in vitro, whereas more limited changes for
genes associated with MS and Scz were observed
(fig. S12).
We performed RNA-seq in human microglia
at 6, 24, and 168 hours following transfer to
tissue culture. Highly dynamic responses were
observed beginning at 6 hours and lasting through-
out the time course (Fig. 4D). Cultured microglia
remained positive for Iba1 staining, whereas no
expression of markers for astrocytes or neurons
was observed, indicating that changes in RNA
expression were not due to contaminating cells
(fig. S13A). A total of 1957 mRNAs were induced
more than fourfold by 6 hours after plating. Gene
ontology analysis of highly induced genes indi-
cated strong enrichment for terms related to in-
flammation and stress responses (fig. S13B, C).
Notably, more than 2000 genes were down-
regulated more than fourfold at 6 hours after
plating, with some genes exhibiting partial re-
covery at the 7-day time point (Fig. 4E and fig.
S13D). Down-regulated genes were strongly en-
riched for terms related to immune cell function
and signaling, as well as immune, blood vessel,
and brain development (fig. S13E). Similar ob-
servations of gene expression over time were
made in mouse microglia cultured for 6, 24, and
168 hours (i.e., 7 days; fig. S14 and table S4).
An environment-dependent
transcriptional network
The perturbation in gene expression resulting
from the transition to an in vitro environment
provided an opportunity to gain insight into
the transcriptional network controlling human
microglia identity. Although SPI1 increased slightly,
most of the mRNAs encoding transcription factors
that recognize enriched motifs in microglia en-
hancers exhibited significant reductions in vitro.
In particular, AP-1 and MEF2 family members,
as well as MAF, RUNX, and SMAD3, were highly
sensitive to the environmental perturbation (Fig.
5A). Similarly, the majority of transcription factors
associated with SEs were also down-regulated
(Fig. 5B).

 We performed ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq for
H3K27ac in microglia placed into culture for
7 days (Fig. 5C). Overall, of the 31,164 ATAC-seq
peaks associated with at least 16 normalized
H3K27ac tags (i.e., high confidence sites), ~14%
exhibited a loss of H3K27ac and ~20% a gain of
H3K27ac (Fig. 5D), indicating remodeling of the
regulatory landscape in vitro. Extending this
analysis, 424 of the 740 SEs defined ex vivo were
lost and 541 new SEs were observed (Fig. 5E).
De novo motif analysis of the ATAC-seq peaks
associated with a >2-fold decrease in H3K27ac
returned recognition elements for PU.1, IRF,
CTCF, AP-1, SMAD, and MEF2 motifs as the most
significantly enriched (Fig. 5F), consistent with
PU.1 establishing microglia enhancers and re-
duced expression and/or activity of many of the
collaborative and signal-dependent factors that
recognize these motifs (Fig. 5A). Notably, loss of
the SMAD motif is consistent with reduced TGF-b
signaling in the in vitro environment.
We compared the expression of the mouse
orthologs of transcription factors with those pre-
sent in primitive yolk sac macrophages and their
progeny in developing and adult mouse brain
(63). A subset of mRNAs encoding these factors
was expressed in primitive macrophages and
maintained high levels of expression in brain
microglia (Fig. 6A). By contrast, an alternative
subset of factors that recognize DNA motifs en-
riched in microglia enhancers and/or were pre-
ferentially expressed in adult human and mouse
microglia exhibited increases in expression from
the embryonic to the adult stage of brain devel-
opment (Fig. 6A). Notably, a majority of the adult
microglia transcription factors that exhibited
reduced expression after transfer to the in vitro
environment were induced following migration
of primitive macrophages into the developing
brain, consistent with their induction by local
environmental factors.
We compared the set of genes robustly up-
regulated during brain development in mouse
microglia to those consistently down-regulated
upon transition to the in vitro environment. A
highly significant overlap was observed: Of 3517
genes that increased during development, 1459
intersected with the 2398 genes “down” in cul-
ture (P < 1E-308; Fig. 6B). This finding illustrates
that a substantial component of the microglia
unique signature that emerges during develop-
ment is down-regulated in vitro.
The correlation between genes up-regulated
in fetal microglia compared to yolk sac macro-
phages and genes down-regulated upon trans-
fer of adult microglia to an in vitro environment
provided evidence that the changes observed in

 vitro result from loss of signals that are part of
the brain environment. We cultured mouse mi-
croglia in vitro for 7 days and treated them with
Tgf-b1 cytokine (Fig. 6C and fig. S15), which is
necessary for maintenance of the in vivo mouse
microglia phenotype (27, 64). Of the 2398 genes
down-regulated >2-fold in vitro, Tgf-b1 induced
expression >2-fold of 429, including Sall1, Tmem119,
and P2ry12. Corresponding studies of TGF-b1 treat-
ment of human microglia in vitro yielded similar
results, although variation between individuals
limited the number of genes achieving statistical
significance after correction for multiple testing.
Nonetheless, SALL1 was among the genes exhibit-
ing significant up-regulation (fig. S15B). Because
of the relatively modest effects of TGF-b1, we
evaluated several other tissue culture conditions
to investigate whether any might be more effec-
tive in maintaining an ex vivo gene expression
signature. Although most treatment conditions
produced some effect on gene expression, none
resulted in preservation of the ex vivo molecular
phenotype (fig. S16). It has not yet been possible
to maintain primary human microglia in a serum-
free environment. Recent studies have derived
microglia-like cells from human induced pluri-
potent stem cells in a defined media that more

 closely resembles cerebrospinal fluid (65). How-
ever, these cells exhibited a transcriptomic phe-
notype that was much more similar to human
microglia cultured in vitro than to ex vivo microg-
lia (fig. S17).
Lastly, we investigated whether genes expressed
at least 10-fold higher in ex vivo microglia com-
pared to brain cortex tissue and that are as-
sociated with differentially regulated genes in
neurodegenerative or behavioral disorders (Fig.
1C) were sensitive to the environment. Of the
nonredundant set of 291 microglia transcripts
associated with differentially regulated genes
in AD, PD, HAND, Scz, or FTD, 117 were down-
regulated in vitro whereas 29 were up-regulated
in vitro (Fig. 6D). These observations provide evi-
dence that differential expression of microglia-
enrichedgenesinthesedisordersisatleastpartially
due to changes in brain environment.
Discussion
The transcriptomes and epigenomic features of
human microglia show that disease status, age,
sex, and treatment history had a relatively minor
influence on the overall pattern of gene expres-
sion. It is thus likely thatthe composite transcript-
omic and epigenomic profiles identified largely
capture a representative human microglial gene
signature and its underlying network of genomic
regulatory elements. We find that mouse and hu-
man microglia transcriptomes are largely con-
served, but they also exhibit large differences
in the expression of several hundred genes that
appear to be primarily driven by cis-regulatory
differences.
Genetic evidence suggests that microglia dysreg-
ulation is a core feature of numerous chronic
neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. To
this end, our profiling of the human microglia
transcriptome enabled us to estimate a weighted
influence of microglia on the development of dif-
ferent brain disorders. In addition, by defining a
microglial gene signature in the human brain, it
is possible to link changes in gene expression in
neurodegenerative and behavioral disorders to
alterations in the number and/or function of
microglia. The observation that the microglial
gene signature overlaps with genes that are both
up- and down-regulated in PD provides strong
evidence that differential gene expression at the
whole-tissue level reflects changes in microglia
gene expression and not simply changes in the
microglia population number. This interpreta-
tion is further reinforced by the observation that
many of the microglia-enriched genes that change
in the context of neurodegenerative and be-
havioral disorders also show significant changes
in expression upon transfer to an in vitro en-
vironment. Although we also observed substan-
tial individual variation in genes linked to
disease risk, more individuals will be required to
power analyses linking genetic variation to gene
expression.
Examining differences in ex vivo and in vitro
microglia, we observe rapid and profound alter-
ations in gene expression by 6 hours, charac-
terized by activation of genes associated with
acute inflammatory responses and decreased
expression of genes associated with diverse im-
mune functions. The incomplete recovery of
down-regulated genes at 7 days was at least in
part due to the absence of brain-specific signals.
At present, the spectrum of brain-specific signals
that are necessary to maintain microglia pheno-
types remains largely unknown, but this finding
highlights the limitations of investigating microg-
lia biology in a tissue culture setting. Notably,
current efforts to reprogram various starting cell
populations to microglia-like cells largely achieve
an in vitro phenotype. It is likely that more com-
plex culture conditions, such as co-culture with
neurons and astrocytes in three-dimensional or
organoid contexts, will be required to more pre-
cisely model the in vivo phenotype. Integration
of these findings with recent studies of yolk sac
and embryonic microglia (56, 63) suggests a model
by which intersecting developmentally deter-
mined and environment-dependent transcrip-
tional networks establish microglia identity and
function (Fig. 6E). We speculate that regulato-
ry elements are targets of environmental per-
turbations associated with disease and are also
important sites of action of natural genetic
variation.
In sum, our work demonstrates that human and
mouse microglia display relatively well-conserved
transcriptomic and epigenomic phenotypes, and
it provides a critical resource that will allow for a
better understanding of mouse models of human
brain disorders, guide reprogramming efforts for
generation of human microglia in vitro, and en-
able a better interpretation of the functions of
DNA variants associated with disorders of the
central nervous system.
Methods
Human tissue
Microglia were isolated from brain tissue (in
excess of that needed for pathological diagno-
sis) resected for treatment of epilepsy, brain
tumors, or acute ischemia in 19 individuals. For
patients with epilepsy (9), the resected tissue dis-
played epileptogenic activity. However, the epi-
leptic focus exhibiting the strongest epileptogenic
activity was not provided and was separated at
the time of resection for pathological analysis.
For patients with brain tumors (8), samples con-
sisted of incidentally resected brain tissue, i.e.,
brain tissue resected to gain access to the tumor
and considered to be tumor negative by the neu-
rosurgeon intraoperatively. Two brain samples
were resected to treat acute ischemic injuries
from individuals who had no prior evidence of
brain pathology. Brain tissue was obtained with
informed consent under a protocol approved
by the UC San Diego and Rady Children’s Hospital
Institutional Review Board. Resected brain tissue
was immediately placed on ice and transferred
to the laboratory for microglia isolation within
3 hours after resection.
Human and mouse microglia isolation
Resected human brain tissues and mouse brains
were homogenized by gentle mechanical disso-
ciation, as performed in Gosselin et al. (25). Mi-
croglia were then enriched by Percoll gradient,
washed, and stained with cell surface markers
for final purification by flow cytometry, using a
BD Influxcellsorter.Humanmicrogliaweredefined
as live/DAPI– CD11b+CD45LowCD64+CX3CR1High
single cells. C57BL/6 mouse microglia were de-
fined as live/DAPI– CD11b+CD45Low single cells.
Primary culture of isolated microglia
Isolated microglia were maintained in culture
for 6 hours, 24 hours, or 7 days. Culture media
consisted of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium
(DMEM)/F12 (Life Technologies, 113300-032)
supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (heat
inactivated, Omega Scientific, FB-12) and 1× Anti-
Anti (Life Technologies, 152240-062). No media
changes were performed for the duration of the
culture experiments. CSF1R ligand Interleukin-
34 (R&D, human 5265-IL-010; mouse 5195-ML-
010) was supplemented daily at a concentration
of 20 ng/ml. For experiments investigating the
effects of TGF-b1 on microglia gene expression
in culture, recombinant human or mouse TGF-
b1 cytokine (R&D, human 240-B-002; mouse 7666-
MB-005) was added daily at a concentration of
10 ng/ml.
RNA-seq library preparation: Isolation
and fragmentation of poly(A) RNA and
synthesis of cDNA
Isolated microglia were pelleted and put into
150 ml of lysis/Oligo d(T) Magnetic Beads binding
buffer and stored at –80°C until processing. For
human brain cortical RNA, 500 ng of RNA was
diluted with proper volume of 2× lysis/Oligo d(T)
Magnetic Beads binding buffer to a final concen-
tration of 1× lysis/Oligo d(T) Magnetic Beads
binding buffer. mRNAs were enriched by incu-
bation with Oligo d(T) Magnetic Beads (NEB,
S1419S) and then fragmented and eluted by in-
cubation at 94°C for 9 min. cDNA was then syn-
thesized with Superscript III (first-strand synthesis;
Life Technologies kit 18080-044) and then DNA
Polymerase I (second-strand synthesis; Enzymat-
ics P7050L)
Chromatin immunoprecipitation
For ChIP-seq experiments, a cross-linking step
with paraformaldehyde was performed imme-
diately after staining but before microglia sort-
ing. Chromatin immunoprecipitation for histone
modification H3K4me2, H3K27ac, and transcrip-
tion factor PU.1 was performed as described in
Gosselin et al. (25).
RNA-seq and ChIP-seq final library
preparation and sequencing
Sequencing libraries were prepared from recov-
ered DNA (ChIP) or generated cDNA (RNA) by
blunting, A-tailing, and adapter ligation as pre-
viously described in Heinz et al. (31). Prior to
final polymerase chain reaction amplification,
RNA-seq libraries were digested by 30 min of
incubation at 37°C with Uracil DNA Glycosylase.
RNA-seq and ChIP-seq libraries were single-end
sequenced for 51 cycles on an Illumina HiSeq

Data analysis
Preprocessing
FASTQ files from sequencing experiments were
mapped to either the UCSC genome build hg38
(for human) or mm10 (for mouse). STAR with de-
fault parameters was used to map RNA-seq ex-
periments. Bowtie2 with default parameters was
used to map ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq experiments.
HOMER was used to convert aligned reads into
“tag directories” for further analysis.
RNA-seq
The “analyzeRepeats” function of HOMER was
used to generate a table of read counts for each ex-
periment using the parameters “-raw -count exons
-strand both -condenseGenes” and a table of tran-
scripts per million (TPM) values using “-tpm
-normMatrix 1e7 -count exons -strand both
-condenseGenes.” The base-2 logarithm of the
TPM values was taken after adding a pseudo-
count of 1 TPM to each gene. Within-species dif-
ferential gene expression analysis was performed
using the R package limma with the voom nor-
malization. Mappingof orthologous genes between
species was done using the one-to-one orthologs
from the Ensembl (version 84) Compara database.
ChIP-seq
Tag directories for the ChIP-seq experiments were
combined into ex vivo and in vitro pools for each
target in both mouse and human. The tag direc-
tories for the input DNA were likewise com-
bined. Peaks were then called on the pooled tags
with the pooled input DNA as background using
HOMER’s “findPeaks” command with the fol-
lowing parameters for the PU.1 ChIP-seq: “-style
factor -size 200 -minDist 200”; and the follow-
ing parameters for the H3K27ac and H3K4me2
ChIP-seq: “-style histone -size 500 -minDist 1000
-region.” The “-tbp” parameter was set to the num-
ber of replicates in the pool.
Motif enrichment
Peaks were considered overlapping if their
coordinates overlapped by at least one base pair.
De novo motif enrichment analysis was performed
on ATAC-seq and PU.1 ChIP-seq peaks that over-
lapped either H3K4me2 (ATAC-seq) or H3K27ac
(PU.1), using HOMER’s “findMotifsGenome” com-
mand with the following parameters: “-size given
-len 14,12,10,8 -mask.”
