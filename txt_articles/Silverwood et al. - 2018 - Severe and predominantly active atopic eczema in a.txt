ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE
To investigate whether adults with atopic eczema are 
at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and 
whether the risk varies by atopic eczema severity and 
condition activity over time.
DESIGN
Population based matched cohort study.
SETTING
UK electronic health records from the Clinical Practice 
Research Datalink, Hospital Episode Statistics, and data 
from the Office for National Statistics, 1998–2015.
PARTICIPANTS
Adults with a diagnosis of atopic eczema, matched 
(on age, sex, general practice, and calendar time) to 
up to five patients without atopic eczema.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Cardiovascular outcomes (myocardial infarction, 
unstable angina, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, 
stroke, and cardiovascular death).
RESULTS
387 439 patients with atopic eczema were matched to 
1 528 477 patients without atopic eczema. The median 
age was 43 at cohort entry and 66% were female. 
Median follow-up was 5.1 years. Evidence of a 10% 
to 20% increased hazard for the non-fatal primary 
outcomes for patients with atopic eczema was found by 
using Cox regression stratified by matched set. There 
was a strong dose-response relation with severity of 
atopic eczema. Patients with severe atopic eczema had 
a 20% increase in the risk of stroke (hazard ratio 1.22, 
99% confidence interval 1.01 to 1.48), 40% to 50% 
increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, unstable 
angina, atrial fibrillation, and cardiovascular death, and 
70% increase in the risk of heart failure (hazard ratio 
1.69, 99% confidence interval 1.38 to 2.06). Patients 
with the most active atopic eczema (active >50% of 
follow-up) were also at a greater risk of cardiovascular 
outcomes. Additional adjustment for cardiovascular 
risk factors as potential mediators partially attenuated 
the point estimates, though associations persisted for 
severe atopic eczema.
CONCLUSIONS
Severe and predominantly active atopic eczema are 
associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular 
outcomes. Targeting cardiovascular disease 
prevention strategies among these patients should be 
considered.
Introduction
Atopic eczema affects up to 10% of adults and is 
becoming more common worldwide.1 It is caused by 
both skin barrier and immune system defects, and there 
is increasing evidence that the systemic inflammatory 
component of atopic eczema may contribute to other 
conditions, including cardiovascular outcomes.2 Given 
the prevalence of atopic eczema, even a small increase 
in cardiovascular risk would be important from a 
public health perspective.
Mixed findings have been reported in cohort 
studies assessing associations between atopic eczema 
and acute cardiovascular outcomes from Taiwan, 
Denmark, and the USA.3-5 It is unclear if any increased 
risk is explained by increased cardiovascular risk 
factors in patients with atopic eczema.3 In studies 
assessing the association between atopic eczema and 
acute cardiovascular outcomes where temporality 
can be inferred, key data on important lifestyle and 
anthropometric confounders, such as body mass index 
and smoking, are largely unavailable. Atopic eczema 
is a relapsing and remitting condition which varies 
in severity and eczema activity, and it is also unclear 
whether the potential association differs by these 
characteristics. Estimates of the spectrum of atopic 
eczema severity vary depending on the approach used 
to define severity.6 Previous reports suggest that around 
30% of patients with atopic eczema would be classified 
as having moderate or severe atopic eczema.7-9
We therefore examined whether adults with atopic 
eczema are at a greater risk of cardiovascular events. 
We also investigated whether the risk of cardiovascular 
disease varied by atopic eczema severity and eczema 
activity over time.
Methods
Study design and setting
We undertook a cohort study with data from the

data, Office for National Statistics mortality data, 
and index of multiple deprivation data. CPRD is a 
database of prospectively collected primary care 
records from general practitioners using Vision 
software; approximately 9% of the UK population are 
represented in the database.10 11 Data are anonymised 
and include diagnoses (coded using Read codes), 
prescriptions (coded using British National Formulary 
codes), and referrals to specialists. Approximately 
80% of CPRD practices registered in England have 
consented to their patients’ primary care records 
being linked to other data sources. Hospital Episode 
Statistics include all NHS inpatient hospital stays in 
England since 1997, with diagnoses coded using 
ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th 
revision) codes and procedures coded according to 
OPCS Classification of Interventions and Procedures 
codes. Office for National Statistics linked mortality 
data contain the underlying cause of death, recorded 
on the death certificate, along with up to 15 other 
recorded causes of death. Causes are coded using 
ICD-9 codes before January 2001 and ICD-10 codes 
thereafter. Index of multiple deprivation data contain 
quintiles of deprivation based on the patient’s 
postcode. For this study, data were extracted from the 
January 2016 CPRD build and the Set 12 linked data. 
Study population
Adult patients (aged ≥18) contributing to CPRD 
between 2 January 1998 and 31 March 2015, with 
linked Hospital Episode Statistics data were eligible for 
inclusion in the study.
Defining patients with atopic eczema 
The exposed cohort included all patients with atopic 
eczema. We defined atopic eczema onset as the 
latest of an atopic eczema diagnosis and two atopic 
eczema treatments (on separate dates), consistent 
with a validation study showing a positive predictive 
value in adults of 82% (95% confidence interval 
73% to 89%).12 Atopic eczema diagnostic codes were 
identified in CPRD (using Read codes) and Hospital 
Episode Statistics (using ICD-10 codes in the primary 
diagnosis field of any episode). Treatments included 
atopic eczema related prescriptions from primary care: 
emollients, topical and oral corticosteroids, tacrolimus 
and systemic immunosuppressants (methotrexate, 
ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil, or azathioprine), 
and phototherapy records from CPRD or OPCS 
Classification of Interventions and Procedures codes in 
Hospital Episode Statistics.
Defining matched unexposed patients
For each patient with atopic eczema, we randomly 
matched up to five patients by age (within 15 years), 
sex, general practice, and calendar time at cohort 
entry. These unexposed patients were required to have 
at least one year of follow-up in CPRD and no history 
of atopic eczema when matched. Any patients with a 
diagnosis of atopic eczema were included in the pool 
of eligible unexposed patients until the date of their 
diagnosis of atopic eczema; before their diagnosis of 
atopic eczema, these patients were not considered 
to have atopic eczema and were therefore eligible to 
contribute to unexposed person time. Patients with 
a diagnosis of atopic eczema who did not go on to 
meet the full definition of atopic eczema (at least one 
diagnosis code and two treatment codes on separate 
dates) were also in the pool of eligible unexposed 
patients up until the date of their atopic eczema 
diagnosis code. Removing these patients from the pool 
of eligible unexposed patients at the point of diagnosis 
rather than allowing them to remain until they met 
the full validated definition of atopic eczema ensured 
greater certainty that the pool of unexposed patients 
did not have atopic eczema. Patients could only be 
sampled as unexposed once during the study (ie, 
sampling without replacement).
Exclusions
After matching, we excluded patients with codes 
indicating previous or current cardiovascular disease, 
including all the main outcome codes plus further 
codes including history (or possible history) of each 
outcome, epidural or subdural strokes, subarachnoid 
haemorrhagic strokes, and risk factors for subarachnoid 
haemorrhage, such as cerebral aneurysms in the circle 
of Willis or arteriovenous malformations.
Defining follow-up
Follow-up for exposed patients began at the latest of: 
2 January 1998, the date the individual turned 18 
years old, the date of diagnosis of atopic eczema, or 
the start of CPRD follow-up plus 365 days (to ensure a 
cardiovascular outcome diagnosis was incident and not 
recorded retrospectively after registration at a general 
practice).13 Follow-up for unexposed individuals began 
at the start date of their matched patient with atopic 
eczema. Follow-up ended at the earliest of study end 
date, death (using Office for National Statistics date or, 
if missing, CPRD death date), transfer out of practice, 
practice last collection date, or the patient developing 
an outcome of interest. For analyses concerning 
stroke only, follow-up ended on the earliest of study 
end date, death, transfer out of practice, practice last 
collection date, the patient developing an outcome of 
interest, or the date of an epidural or subdural stroke, 
subarachnoid haemorrhagic stroke, or risk factor for 
subarachnoid haemorrhage (such as embolisation of 
cerebral artery and non-ruptured cerebral aneurysm). 
Patients contributing at least one day of follow-up were 
included in the study.
Severe and predominantly active atopic eczema
Severity of atopic eczema was defined as a time-
updated variable for patients with atopic eczema. 
Patients with atopic eczema were considered to have 
mild conditions by default. They were classified as 
having moderate atopic eczema at the first of: a second 
potent topical corticosteroid treatment within one 
year or a first calcineurin inhibitor treatment. Patients 
were classified as having severe atopic eczema at the

first of: a systemic immunosuppressant treatment; 
a phototherapy code in CPRD or Hospital Episode 
Statistics; or a referral for atopic eczema. Once defined 
as moderate, patients with atopic eczema remained 
as such unless they developed severe atopic eczema; 
once defined as severe, patients with atopic eczema 
remained as such, similar to established approaches 
for defining severity in psoriasis studies.14 At any given 
point during follow-up, patients with atopic eczema 
therefore belonged to one of three severity categories: 
mild, moderate, or severe.
Atopic eczema activity was assessed over time. 
Active atopic eczema started at the latest of two CPRD 
or Hospital Episode Statistics atopic eczema records 
(either diagnoses or treatment) appearing within any 
one year period. Active atopic eczema was assumed 
to last for 12 months, unless another atopic eczema 
record appeared, in which case its duration was 
prolonged for another 12 months. Patients with atopic 
eczema were subsequently split into three categories 
for analysis: those who never had active atopic eczema 
during follow-up, those who had active atopic eczema 
for less than 50% of follow-up, and those who had 
active atopic eczema for at least 50% of follow-up.
Cardiovascular outcomes
We identified the following individual cardiovascular 
diseases in CPRD and Hospital Episode Statistics 
(primary diagnosis fields of any episode): myocardial 
infarction, unstable angina, heart failure, atrial 
fibrillation, stroke (ischaemic, haemorrhagic, or 
unspecified), and cardiovascular death. Secondary 
outcomes 
included 
coronary 
revascularisation 
procedures, identified in OPCS Classification of 
Interventions and Procedures data. Deaths from 
cardiovascular disease were identified from Office for 
National Statistics data, defined as any ICD-9 or ICD-
10 code related to cardiovascular disease recorded as 
a cause of death.
Covariates
We used a directed acyclic graph to inform the 
identification of covariates and mediators and to 
avoid collider bias (see supplementary figure S1).15 
The covariates included current age, calendar period 
(1997-99, 2000-04, 2005-09, 2010-15), time since 
diagnosis (0-4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-19, ≥20 years), and 
socioeconomic status (quintiles of 2015 index of 
multiple deprivation). Patients were defined as 
having diabetes mellitus (type 1, type 2, or missing), 
hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, depression, anxiety, 
or asthma on the date of their first ever Read code in 
CPRD for these conditions, which may have been after 
cohort entry, as a time updated variable. Body mass 
index (according to WHO categories) and smoking 
status (current smoker, former smoker, or non-smoker) 
were defined at cohort entry. Patients were defined as 
having severe alcohol use at the first of: high alcohol 
use code or treatment for severe alcohol use recorded 
in CPRD. Patients were defined as exposed to high dose 
(≥20 mg/day) oral corticosteroids for the duration of 
their prescription and three months after the end of the 
prescription. Further details regarding the definition 
of these variables can be found in the supplementary 
material.
Statistical analysis
Primary analyses
The characteristics of those with and without atopic 
eczema (at cohort entry) were described. We used Cox 
regression stratified by matched set (matched on age at 
cohort entry, sex, general practice, and date at cohort 
entry) with current age as the underlying timescale 
to generate hazard ratios for the association between 
atopic eczema and each cardiovascular outcome (the 
unadjusted model). Subsequent multivariable analyses 
adjusted for current calendar period (1997-99, 2000-
04, 2005-09, 2010-15), current time since diagnosis 
(0-4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-19, ≥20 years), socioeconomic 
status, and time varying asthma (the adjusted model). 
The adjusted model was further adjusted for variables 
which may have been on the causal pathway (ie, 
mediators) between atopic eczema and cardiovascular 
outcomes (smoking and body mass index at cohort 
entry, and time varying diabetes, hypertension, 
hyperlipidaemia, depression and anxiety, and severe 
alcohol use) (the mediation model). Patients with 
missing body mass index, smoking, or index of multiple 
deprivation data were excluded. These data are likely 
to be missing not at random (as missingness is likely 
to depend on the actual values). Multiple imputation 
would therefore not be appropriate. Complete case 
analysis is valid where the missingness is independent 
of each of the cardiovascular outcomes, conditional 
on the model covariates.16 We used 99% confidence 
intervals and an implied 1% level of statistical 
significance to reduce the risk of type 1 error.
Incidence rates of each cardiovascular outcome 
in the patients with atopic eczema were estimated 
by using the data in our sample. Incidence rates of 
each cardiovascular outcome among patients without 
atopic eczema (which cannot be reliably estimated 
from the sample owing to the matching) were then 
estimated by multiplying the incidence rate in the 
patients with atopic eczema by our corresponding 
estimated hazard ratio (after having first inverted it 
so that it compares unexposed with exposed). We 
calculated attributable risks as the difference between 
these exposure group specific incidence rates. The 
population attributable risk of each cardiovascular 
outcome was estimated by using the estimated hazard 
ratio and assuming the prevalence of atopic eczema 
to be 10%.17
Secondary analyses
We repeated the analyses within strata of sex, current 
asthma status, and current age (18-39, 40-59, and 
≥60) to explore potential effect modification. We 
also repeated the analysis with alternative exposure 
definitions, where atopic eczema was categorised 
based on severity and, separately, on category of 
eczema activity.

Sensitivity analyses and model checking
Table 1 shows the series of sensitivity analyses we 
conducted. We also checked the proportional hazards 
assumption in all the primary analysis models through 
plots of the Schöenfeld residuals.
Patient involvement
The research questions, design, conduct, and initial 
results and interpretation of the findings of this study 
have been overseen by the Wellcome Senior Clinical 
Fellowship steering committee, which includes lay 
representation. No patients were asked to advise on 
interpretation or writing up of results. There are no 
plans to disseminate the results of the research to 
study participants.
Results
Figure 1 shows that in total, 466 883 exposed and 
2 169 123 unexposed patients were successfully 
matched and were eligible for cohort entry. Of these, 
517 444 (19.6%) were excluded from subsequent 
analyses as they did not have complete data on the 
analysis variables (19.2% missing body mass index, 
5.3% missing smoking, and 0.1% missing index of 
multiple deprivation), and a further 202 646 (7.7%) 
patients were excluded as they had no remaining 
matches. This left a final analysis sample of 387 439 
exposed and 1 528 477 unexposed patients. Table 2 
and supplementary table S1 show that distributions 
of variables did not differ substantially between those 
included in the final analysis sample and the overall 
sample, except for a somewhat higher proportion 
of exposed patients (20.2% v 17.7%), more female 
patients (66.0% v 60.0%), and fewer of the very 
youngest (aged 18–19) patients (6.5% v 14.5%) in the 
analysis sample. Median follow-up was 5.1 years and 
over the follow-up period, 19 700 (5.1%) patients with 
atopic eczema experienced severe atopic eczema.
Table 1 | Sensitivity analyses
Sensitivity analysis
Justification
The activity analysis was repeated, restricted to patients with at least five 
years of follow-up
To explore any potential bias caused by patients with 
atopic eczema with short follow-up periods being more 
likely to have either none or all of their follow-up with 
active atopic eczema
The primary analysis was repeated on an incident atopic eczema cohort 
(exposed patients defined as those joining the cohort when they first fulfil our 
diagnostic criteria and after the start of the study period)
Covariates measured at entry precede atopic eczema on-
set so will not be on the causal pathway between atopic 
eczema and cardiovascular outcomes
The primary analysis was repeated on patients with at least one consultation 
with their doctor in the year before cohort entry
To exclude practice non-attenders
The primary analysis was repeated on a redefined cohort, where the pool of 
unexposed patients also included patients with an atopic eczema diagnosis 
but without two further treatments for the entire duration of their follow-up 
and patients in the exposed cohort (with an atopic eczema diagnosis and two 
further treatments) were included as unexposed up until their cohort entry (ie, 
the latest of their atopic eczema diagnosis and their two further treatments)
To explore the sensitivity of the results to the definition of 
the exposure
The primary analysis was repeated on a second redefined cohort where 
exposed patients were those with an atopic eczema diagnosis only (ie, without 
requiring two atopic eczema treatments), and these patients were eligible for 
the unexposed cohort up until their atopic eczema diagnosis (some patients 
may have childhood atopic eczema, but may not have treatment codes record-
ed if they registered at the practice during adulthood, and therefore may be 
erroneously excluded from the exposed cohort in the primary analysis)
To explore the sensitivity of the results to the definition of 
the exposure
The primary analysis was repeated on a subset of patients registered from 
2007 onwards
Data on covariates, particularly body mass index and 
smoking, would be expected to be more complete, thus 
reducing any selection bias owing to missing data
The primary analysis was repeated on a subset of patients registered from 
2007 onwards, additionally adjusting for ethnic group (white, South Asian, 
black, other, or mixed, identified from Clinical Practice Research Datalink and 
Hospital Episode Statistics data using a previously developed algorithm)18
To examine whether the omission of this covariate in the 
primary analysis may have introduced bias
The primary analysis (mediation model only) was repeated with additional 
adjustment for time updated use of high dose corticosteroids

Table 3 shows that in the primary analysis, there was 
evidence of associations between atopic eczema and 
all cardiovascular outcomes, except for cardiovascular 
death. Associations were strongest with unstable 
angina (hazard ratio 1.25, 99% confidence interval 
1.11 to 1.41 in the adjusted model) and heart failure 
(1.19, 1.10 to 1.30), with partial attenuation in the 
mediation model.
Table 4 shows that the estimated attributable risks 
confirm the increased incidence rates of cardiovascular 
outcomes among patients with atopic eczema. 
Attributable risks were greatest for heart failure (40 per 
100 000, 99% confidence interval 22 to 57) and atrial 
fibrillation (37, 15 to 55). The greatest population 
attributable risks were estimated for unstable angina 
(2.4%, 1.1% to 3.9%) and heart failure (1.9%, 1.0% 
to 2.9%).
There was no convincing evidence of effect 
modification by age, sex, or current asthma status (see 
supplementary tables S2-4).
Effect estimates were substantially stronger in 
patients with severe atopic eczema, in particular for 
unstable angina (hazard ratio 1.48, 99% confidence 
interval 1.08 to 2.03 in the adjusted model) and heart 
failure (1.69, 1.38 to 2.06) (see fig 2 and supplementary 
table S5). Similar findings were observed for patients 
with the most active atopic eczema, in particular for 
unstable angina (1.49, 1.30 to 1.72) and heart failure 
(1.43, 1.30 to 1.56) (see fig 3 and supplementary table 
S6).
Sensitivity analyses
Restricting the activity analysis to patients with at least 
five years of follow-up (43% of all patients) generally 
gave similar findings, though results for cardiovascular 
death changed more markedly, with the estimates for 
the never and <50% activity groups attenuated towards 
the null (see supplementary table S7). Results from the 
analysis with the incident atopic eczema cohort (54% 
of those in the primary analysis) were very similar to 
those in the primary analysis (see supplementary table 
S8). When analyses were restricted to patients with 
at least one consultation with their doctor in the year 
before cohort entry (83% of all patients) the estimated 
hazard ratios were attenuated slightly relative to those 
in the primary analysis (see supplementary table S9). 
The results from the analyses with the two redefined 
patient cohorts differed somewhat from those in the 
primary analysis (see supplementary tables S10 and 
S11); however, all confidence intervals included the 
point estimate from the main analysis. Only 11% of 
patients had registrations from 2007 onwards, and 
this small subset of patients differed substantially 
from the primary analysis sample, particularly in 
terms of age (younger; see supplementary table S12), 
and therefore the hazard ratios differed markedly 
(see supplementary table S13). Results adjusted for 
ethnic group (restricting to the 9% of patients with 
such data) were consistent with the main analysis (see 
supplementary table S14), suggesting limited bias 
from omission of this covariate. Results adjusted for 
time updated use of high dose corticosteroids were 
consistent with the main analysis (see supplementary 
table S15), similarly suggesting limited bias from 
omission of this covariate.
discussion
This study shows that atopic eczema is associated 
with a moderately increased risk of non-fatal 
cardiovascular outcomes, with a dose-response 
for atopic eczema severity and cumulated activity. 
Patients with severe atopic eczema were at a 20% 
increased risk of stroke, 40-50% increased risk 
of unstable angina, myocardial infarction, atrial 
fibrillation, and cardiovascular death, and 70% 
increased risk of heart failure. The most active 
atopic eczema group had similar findings. Estimated 
attributable risks confirm the increased incidence 
rates of cardiovascular outcomes among patients 
with atopic eczema, with population attributable 
risks of 2% or more for some outcomes.

Comparison with other studies
Mechanistic work suggests that atopic eczema may 
be associated with increased platelet activation and 
decreased fibrinolysis, which may increase the risk of 
clotting,19 though a recent study found no association 
with metabolite levels.20 The association between 
atopic eczema and cardiovascular outcomes has been 
inconsistent in the literature. Studies from Taiwanese 
populations report a 1.33-fold increased incidence 
of stroke, rising to 1.71-fold increase in those with 
severe atopic eczema.4 Studies in Danish and German 
populations have reported positive associations 
between severe atopic eczema and cardiovascular 
outcomes (including angina, myocardial infarction, 
and stroke), whereas the association with mild 
atopic eczema has been either slightly protective or 
close to zero.3 20 This may suggest a dose-response 
effect, 
an 
alternative 
pathogenesis 
underlying 
mild compared with severe conditions, the effect 
of systemic therapies used to treat severe forms of 
atopic eczema, or misclassification bias owing to 
the way in which patients with atopic eczema were 
classified. The European and Taiwanese studies used 
data from administrative databases which are likely 
to have incomplete data on potentially important 
cardiovascular risk factors including body mass index,

smoking, and alcohol consumption. These factors 
may be more prevalent in patients with atopic eczema 
and could therefore contribute to an increased risk of 
cardiovascular outcomes.21 Our cohort study is one 
of the few longitudinal studies to have adjusted for 
these risk factors. Silverberg et al adjusted for body 
mass index, smoking, alcohol consumption, and 
physical activity in three cross sectional surveys in 
USA populations, and still found strong associations 
between atopic eczema and angina, coronary artery 
disease, myocardial infarction, and stroke.22 However, 
these studies were cross sectional, and misclassification 
is likely owing to exposures and outcomes being self 
reported. A study in a specific USA population found 
no noticeable association between self reported atopic 
eczema and either myocardial infarction or stroke in 
female nurses.5
Strengths and weaknesses of this study
This is the largest study to assess the association 
between atopic eczema and major cardiovascular 
events. It is also the first study based on primary 
care data, meaning that our results are generalisable 
to a broad population with atopic eczema. We used 
population based data from UK general practices 
with linked data on hospital stays and cause specific 
mortality.23 24 Previous studies have shown that this 
population is largely representative of the general UK 
population.11 We used a validated algorithm to identify 
atopic eczema and our approach to defining atopic 
eczema severity showed a similar distribution of severity 
to the literature.12 14 For most of our study population, 
we had data on body mass index, smoking, and 
severe alcohol use, allowing us to adjust for potential 
mediators between atopic eczema and cardiovascular 
outcomes. We used a directed acyclic graph to identify 
covariates and mediators, and to avoid collider bias.15 
The study outcomes require medical intervention and 
therefore presentation in primary or secondary care, 
meaning that ascertainment bias is unlikely to be a 
problem. One exception may be asymptomatic atrial 
fibrillation, though this is only a minor proportion 
of the total patients with atrial fibrillation so any 
ascertainment bias is likely to be limited.
Limitations of the study, inherent to most large 
observational studies, include the possibility for 
confounding, bias, and missing data. It is not possible 
to separate the effects of therapy and severity, owing 
to the nature of routinely collected data sources and 
observational settings whereby those with more

severe atopic eczema are given specific treatments, 
and where those treatments might be continued for 
long periods. Patients were matched within 15 year 
age intervals as finer age matching led to a noticeable 
loss of patients with atopic eczema, who did not have 
any eligible matches. However, age was accounted for 
as the underlying timescale in all analyses, closely 
adjusting for the confounding effects of age. Exclusion 
of patients without complete data on body mass index, 
smoking, and index of multiple deprivation reduced 
the sample by nearly 20%. However, we believe that 
there are no factors leading to missing data which 
would 
independently 
affect 
the 
cardiovascular 
outcomes in question, therefore using a complete 
case analysis was valid. Findings for cardiovascular 
death were counterintuitive, as low atopic eczema 
activity seemed protective against mortality relative 
to no atopic eczema. This finding may be explained 
by the poor capture of data on activity: some patients 
may have active atopic eczema but do not adhere to 
treatment, thus being misclassified as never active. 
As this association was largely attenuated when the 
analysis was restricted to patients with at least five 
years of follow-up, another possible explanation could 
be survival bias, but this needs to be confirmed in other 
studies. Assessing major long term health outcomes 
in a condition such as atopic eczema that frequently 
starts in early childhood may be challenging owing to 
possible survival bias; the prevalent cohort would have 
fewer patients rapidly developing the cardiovascular 
outcomes (those at greatest risk) as they may not 
be eligible for sampling.25 26 As survival bias would 
bias the association between atopic eczema and 
cardiovascular disease towards the null, it cannot 
explain our findings, and could potentially have led 
to underestimation of the associations.27 Similarly 
to activity of atopic eczema, misclassification of 
condition severity is possible, for example if patients 
with severe conditions used only topical treatment. 
However, such misclassification would bias our result 
towards the null, underestimating the magnitude of 
the associations.
By contrast, bias owing to onset confounding 
(differential time since atopic eczema onset) may bias 
away from the null if the risk of cardiovascular disease 
increases with time since atopic eczema onset and 
most patients with atopic eczema are prevalent cases 
who may have a greater risk of cardiovascular disease. 
Consistency in results when restricting to incident atopic 
eczema diagnoses suggests that this is not a major issue.

Conclusions
We have shown a clinically relevant increase in the 
risk of acute cardiovascular outcomes in patients 
with atopic eczema. This increased risk is largely 
confined to patients with severe or more active atopic 
eczema and persists despite adjusting for potential 
mediators, including conventional risk factors for 
cardiovascular outcomes. Consideration should be 
given to developing prevention strategies to reduce 
the risk of cardiovascular disease among patients 
with severe or predominantly active atopic eczema, 
including awareness of and screening for conventional 
cardiovascular risk factors by those providing clinical 
care. Current biological treatments for atopic eczema 
have the potential to greatly change care for those 
with challenging eczema. The next objective will be to 
reduce the risk of cardiovascular outcomes.
