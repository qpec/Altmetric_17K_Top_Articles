Abstract
Some researchers, running instructors, and coaches have suggested that the “optimal” footstrike pattern to improve performance and reduce
running injuries is to land using a mid- or forefoot strike. Thus, it has been recommended that runners who use a rearfoot strike would benefit by
changing their footstrike although there is little scientific evidence for suggesting such a change. The rearfoot strike is clearly more prevalent. The
major reasons often given for changing to a mid- or forefoot strike are (1) it is more economical; (2) there is a reduction in the impact peak and
loading rate of the vertical component of the ground reaction force; and (3) there is a reduction in the risk of a running-related injuries. In this paper,
we critique these 3 suggestions and provide alternate explanations that may provide contradictory evidence for altering one’s footstrike pattern.
We have concluded, based on examining the research literature, that changing to a mid- or forefoot strike does not improve running economy, does
not eliminate an impact at the foot-ground contact, and does not reduce the risk of running-related injuries.

1. Introduction
There are 3 types of footstrike patterns that human runners
can employ. These are generally referred to as (1) rearfoot, (2)
midfoot, and (3) forefoot. Footstrike patterns are categorized
depending on the portion of the foot that initially contacts the
running surface. For example, when using a rearfoot strike, a
runner will contact the ground with the lateral aspect of the heel
eventually toeing off as in the other footstrikes. Here, we use
operational definitions for mid- and forefoot striking.A midfoot
strike is one in which the runner initially contacts the ground
across the metatarsal heads with the heel subsequently contact-
ing the running surface while the forefoot strike is also one in
which the initial contact is also on the metatarsal heads but the
heel never touches the ground.
A study by Lieberman and colleagues1 reported that indi-
viduals who have never worn shoes used a forefoot strike
whereas those who are habitually shod used a rearfoot strike
when running. This finding has been recently disputed by
Hatala and associates2 who reported that 72% of habitually
barefoot African runners ran with a rearfoot strike although
these data were collected in a different region of Africa than the
previous study. However, Lieberman’s findings led to the notion
that humans may have evolved to be forefoot runners thus the
forefoot pattern was the more “natural” footstrike compared to
a rearfoot strike.1 Lieberman’s suggestions have led to several
papers in the literature on barefoot versus forefoot running,
many of which appear to promote a mid- or forefoot strike (e.g.,
Ahn et al.3 and Paavolainen et al.4). Extending the notion that
mid- or forefoot running is optimal for barefoot running is the
suggestion that mid- or forefoot running is also optimal for
shod running. Many running coaches have then suggested that
changing a runner’s footfall pattern from an “unnatural”
rearfoot strike to a “more natural” forefoot strike, whether
unshod or shod, may be a propitious way to improve perfor-
mance and possibly reduce running-related injuries.5–7
There are many programs such as Pose running8,9 or Chi
running10 that have influenced numerous running coaches to
instruct runners to alter their footstrike to an mid- or forefoot
strike. While some papers in the literature have suggested such
a change to a mid- or forefoot strike,3,4,11–14 to our knowledge,
currently little evidence exists in the literature that conclusively
demonstrates that runners would benefit from altering their
footstrike in the long term.

 It is possible that switching from one footstrike pattern to
another has become popular because of reports of isolated
anecdotes rather than examining the idea that switching
footstrike pattern would benefit all runners. Findings from a
survey study indicate that 46% of those that switched from a
rearfoot to a mid- or forefoot strike (n = 397/866) changed their
footstrike because of previous injuries and this group reported
experiencing a total of 500 injuries before they switched.12
However, the authors did not report any data on the number of
injuries that occurred in these participants after they changed
their footstrike. No doubt there are some runners who benefitted
from altering their habitual footstrike, but which runners and
for what reasons are currently unknown. Studies have suggested
that some individuals accrue some benefits by changing to a
mid- or forefoot strike.11–14 However, to extend this notion to all
runners may not be a prudent or beneficial recommendation.
There are 3 major reasons that those who support altering
one’s footstrike give for changing to a mid- or forefoot strike
from a rearfoot strike. These are (1) it is more economical; (2)
there is a reduction in the impact peak and loading rate of the
vertical component of the ground reaction force (VGRF); and
(3) there is a reduction in the risk of a running-related injury. In
this paper, we will critique these “reasons for change” and
discuss alternate explanations that may provide contradictory
evidence for altering one’s footstrike to a mid- or forefoot
strike. We focus on differences between shod rearfoot and shod
mid- or forefoot strike running to isolate the differences
between footstrike patterns without the influence of footwear.
2. Footfall pattern frequency and selection
The prevalence of the different footstrike patterns in the
running population and how footstrike has been determined in
the literature is a very important aspect of understanding
footstrike behavior. There are at least 2 methods of determining
a runner’s footstrike. Cavanagh and Lafortune15 suggested a
method of determining footstrike pattern based on the location
of the center of pressure pattern at initial ground contact termed
the strike index. With a rearfoot strike, the foot initially contacts
the ground in the posterior 1/3 of the length of the foot. In a
forefoot strike, initial contact is on the anterior 1/3 of the foot
generally in the area of the metatarsal heads. A midfoot strike is
the most difficult to determine as the strike index suggests that
initial contact is in the middle 1/3 of the foot. Recently, a study
by Gruber et al.16 suggested that, in addition to the strike index,
the position of the ankle joint at foot contact (i.e., dorsiflexed
for the rearfoot strike and plantar flexed for the mid- or forefoot
strikes) and the presence (rearfoot runner) or absence (forefoot
runner) of an impact peak in the component VGRF should be
used together as indicators of a footstrike, rather than 1 metric
alone as seen in many studies. However, in this paper, we will
combine the mid- and forefoot strikes into a mid- or forefoot
strike because the initial contact in both is on the metatarsal
heads of the forefoot.
Interestingly, the epidemiologic data on footstrike demo-
graphics show that the rearfoot strike is one that is used by the
greatest percentage of runners while the forefoot strike is used
by a significantly lesser number of runners. Kerr et al.17 found
that 81% of runners at the 10 km and 20 km point of a marathon
used a rearfoot strike while 19% used a midfoot strike. In an
elite half-marathon, Hasegawa et al.18 reported that 75% of
runners used a rearfoot strike, 23% a midfoot strike, and 2% a
forefoot strike. More recently, Larson et al.19 concurred with the
results of both the Kerr et al.17 and Hasegawa et al.18 studies.
The prevalence of rearfoot runners has also been reported to be
as high as 94% of 1991 runners in a competitive road race20 and
95% of 514 runners tested in a laboratory setting.21 Each of
these studies reports a very low percentage of runners using a
true forefoot strike. It has been argued that the high prevalence
of the rearfoot strike is a result of the modern cushioned
running shoe facilitating a rearfoot strike;22 however, this specu-
lation has been recently refuted.23
Which footfall pattern an individual selects may depend on
a number of factors. In a forward dynamics simulation model-
ing study, it was reported that the rearfoot strike was optimal for
the greatest number of goals of running, which include mini-
mizing metabolic cost.24 However, the model selected a more
anterior footstrike (i.e., mid- or forefoot) to optimize for higher
running speeds but at a greater metabolic cost. This result is
supported by a human study for which increasing running
speed resulted in 45% of runners switching to a more anterior
footstrike.25 Thus, it appears that the choice of footstrike may be
task-specific. Running a long distance may require a rearfoot
strike to minimize the metabolic cost of running while a more
anterior footstrike may be necessary to run faster.
3. Changes in the economy of running
Several studies have observed that the top finishers of short,
middle, and long distance events tended to use a mid- or fore-
foot strike.17,18,21 Similar findings from earlier studies specu-
lated that a mid- or forefoot strike increases the effective
storage and release of elastic energy compared with a rearfoot
strike and has led some to suggest that it is more economical
(i.e., consume less submaximal oxygen for a given task) to run
with either a mid- or forefoot pattern.17,18,26–29 However, several
studies, each with a small sample size and thus low statistical
power, directly compared running economy between rear- and
forefoot strike and reported no statistically significant differ-
ences in intra-subject oxygen consumption between these
footstrike patterns.29–31
Ardigo and colleagues30 reported no difference in oxygen
uptake or internal mechanical work between a group of habitual
rearfoot runners using both a rear- and forefoot strike pattern.
These results were supported by later studies also showing no
difference in running economy between rear- and forefoot
strike patterns.29,31 However, these studies were limited by low
sample sizes and used only habitual rearfoot runners31 or only
habitual midfoot runners.29 Recent studies have reported that
there was little or no difference in the net mass normalized
oxygen consumption or the net metabolic rate between mid- or
forefoot runners versus rearfoot runners performing with their
habitual footstrike pattern across submaximal running speeds
(Fig. 1).32,33
147
Running footfall patterns
 Gruber et al.32 investigated running economy when rear- and
forefoot runners were asked to run with the alternative
footstrikes. When the participants were asked to run with their
non-habitual footstrike, the habitual rearfoot group experienced
a significant increase in oxygen consumption but there were no
statistically significant changes in oxygen consumption in the
habitual forefoot group. Given that performing a new running
form or style typically increases oxygen consumption before
habituation,34,35 it would be expected that participants would
perform better with their habitual pattern. Although this expec-
tation was true for the rearfoot group, this was not the case with
the forefoot group. Alternatively, a new running form or style is
considered more economical if it results in a reduction of
oxygen consumption without a habituation period.36 The results
from Gruber et al.32 indicated that habituation was not neces-
sary in order for the forefoot group to have a similar running
economy between footstrikes across the 3 tested speeds. In the
rearfoot group, performing a forefoot strike increased oxygen
consumption to a large enough degree that habituation would
not eventually result in forefoot running becoming more eco-
nomical. Therefore, the assumption that rearfoot runners would
improve their performance by changing their footstrike, either
immediately or after training, appear unfounded.
A further analysis of the data in the Gruber et al.32 study
included an investigation of carbohydrate oxidation between
footfall patterns. Carbohydrate oxidation is a limiting factor for
endurance exercise.32 At the slow and moderate speeds of
running selected in the Gruber study, carbohydrate oxidation
was greater in a forefoot foot strike than in a rearfoot strike. The
implication here is that a forefoot strike would deplete their
carbohydrate stores sooner compared to a rearfoot strike at the
same running speed. Therefore, switching from a mid- or fore-
foot strike to a rearfoot strike may also be a mechanism to
conserve glycogen stores and delay when a runner would “hit
the wall” during an endurance race.36 This assumption is some-
what supported by Jewell and colleagues37 who found that
habitual mid- and forefoot runners tended to adopt a more
posterior landing pattern, which was characterized by longer
contact times and the visual appearance of an impact peak
within the VGRF during the progression of a fatiguing run.
4. Changes in the VGRF impact peak
In a plot of the VGRF versus time for a rearfoot strike, there
is a distinct first peak referred to as the impact peak and, later in
the ground contact phase, a second peak referred to as the active
peak. In the mid- or forefoot strike, there may not be a visible
impact peak in the VGRF plotted across stance time but there
will be an active peak (Fig. 2).
Running with a mid- or forefoot strike substantially dimin-
ishes the appearance of the vertical impact peak or causes it to
be visually absent. This observation has led many to speculate
that changing one’s footstrike to a mid- or forefoot strike would
significantly reduce the vertical impact peak and the vertical
rate of loading during a ground contact compared to the
rearfoot strike.38–41 Furthermore, the implication is that, because
of the absence of the impact peak and the lesser loading rate,
there would be a lower risk of impact related injuries to the
lower extremity.1,11,42,43
Vertical impact peaks are not conspicuous in the VRGF
versus time plots of runners with a mid- or forefoot strike.
Recent studies have found evidence of the vertical impact force
in mid- or forefoot running although it was visually absent in
the time-domain plots. In a study by Gruber et al.44 the VGRF
was analyzed in the frequency domain using a Fourier analysis.
It was reported that frequencies in the 10–20 Hz range (i.e., the
range of frequencies of the impact peak in rearfoot running44)
were observed in forefoot strike runners although the amplitude
of these frequencies was less than rearfoot runners (Fig. 3).
While there is no obvious impact peak seen in the time domain,
it appears that there is an impact in forefoot running although it
may occur with a lower magnitude and loading rate than that in
rearfoot running.44
Then the question that arises is why the vertical impact is not
visually obvious in the time domain. This question can be
answered by referring to Bobbert et al.45,46 and Shorten and
Mientjes.47 These researchers showed that the impact peak in
rearfoot running was determined by the force of the lower
extremity of the landing limb colliding with the ground while
the active force is a result of the motion of the rest of the body.

 This lower extremity impact force (i.e., passive peak) is super-
imposed on the active force of the rest of the body as it contacts
the ground, which results in the typical VGRF that we often see.
This is illustrated in the schematic in Fig. 4. In this figure, for a
rearfoot strike, we see that there are 2 different portions of the
VGRF component, which represent limb contact and the
contact of the rest of the body, that are ultimately added together
to produce the total VGRF component that we usually see. The
impact and active forces are also superimposed in a forefoot
strike; however, the timing of the peak deceleration of the
contacting limb may occur much later in the support phase and
thus is “hidden” by the active force of the rest of the body.
Gruber and colleagues48 illustrated the impact and passive
peaks in both rearfoot and forefoot strikes using a wavelet
analysis. In their analysis, it is clear that an impact peak exists
in both rearfoot and forefoot strikes but the impact peak in
forefoot running is of lesser magnitude and occurs later in the
support period (Fig. 5).
Furthermore, we must ask whether the visual appearance or
the reduction of the vertical impact peak is a reason to change
footstrike pattern. The influence of the impact peak and loading
rate on the risk of running injury development has been a source
of debate and discussion in biomechanics for many years.
Reducing impact forces and the rate at which they are imposed
has been suggested to reduce the risk of impact related injuries.
However, the relationship between impact characteristics and
injuries has not been established conclusively. There are similar
number of retrospective studies49–52 and prospective studies53–55
that have found an association with impact characteristics and
injury. However, there are other studies that found no relation-
ship
between
impact
characteristics
and
injury
either
retrospectively56–59 or prospectively.60–64 Studies by several
researchers have reported a link between a higher vertical
impact peak or vertical loading rate or both resulting in an
impact running-related injury.49–55 However, other researchers
have shown little or no relationship between VGRF parameters

Running footfall patterns
 and the risk of injury.56–64 It is quite apparent that some level of
force application is necessary for bone health.65 However, it is
unknown how much loading is necessary for bone health versus
how much is detrimental to bone health. For example, some
studies have reported that greater impact magnitudes and
loading rates were observed in samples that had fewer running
injuries than those with reduced impact characteristics. Nigg66
reported that runners with greater impact peaks and higher
loading rates had significantly fewer running-related injuries
compared with runners with lower impact peaks and loading
rates. Van Mechelen67 found that running on firmer surfaces,
which would theoretically increase the impact load on the body,
was not associated with the incidence of injury. The argument,
therefore, that reducing the impact peak and loading rate is
questionable at best in terms of running-related injuries.
The fact that there is a force resulting from the foot-ground
collision not only in a rearfoot strike, but in the mid- or forefoot
strikes as well, and that relationship between these kinetic
parameters and injury is tenuous at best, are both evidence that
the appearance or non-appearance of an impact peak in the time
domain is not sufficient for changing one’s footstrike. Addition-
ally, prospective running injury studies have yet to demonstrate
whether one footstrike is less injurious than the other. Using the
VGRF to infer that forefoot running is “safer” than rearfoot
running is not supported by evidence.
Many other parameters, such as spatio-temoral variables and
sagittal and frontal plane kinematics,68 apart from VGRF char-
acteristics, have been compared between footstrikes that may be
related to the development of running-related overuse injuries.
For example, Boyer and Derrick69 examined the differences in
several factors that may contribute to the development of ilio-
tibial band strain between habitual rearfoot and habitual mid-
and forefoot runners including step width, pelvic drop, hip
adduction angle, and iliotibial band strain among other vari-
ables. Although some variables were statistically different
between footstrikes—with some differences indicating rearfoot
to be “better” and others indicating forefoot to be “better”—the
authors concluded that the magnitude of the differences were
small enough to suggest that one footstrike does not appear to
be universally more protective against running-related injuries
than the other.69 Other investigators have also observed that a
rearfoot strike may be better for one parameter but a forefoot
strike may be better for another parameter. In particular, there
may be a shift to a greater demand on knee structures and
musculature than the ankle with rearfoot running but a greater
demand on ankle and foot structures and musculature than the
knee with forefoot running.14,70–73 For example, Kulmala and
colleagues14 found that forefoot runners had less patellofemoral
stress than rearfoot runners but that rearfoot runners had lower
plantar flexor muscle and Achilles tendon loading than forefoot
runners. Similarly, Rooney and Derrick74 found that a forefoot
strike resulted in greater axial ankle joint contact force com-
pared with a rearfoot strike. Collectively, this evidence suggests
that switching from one footstrike to another may result in
exposure to different types of injury mechanisms rather than
one footstrike being more or less injurious than the other.75,76
5. Changes in the risk of running-related injuries
Most studies that have investigated injury rates between
footstrike patterns have examined the rate of injury in either
habitual rearfoot or habitual mid- or forefoot strikers. While
this is important, it does not give us any insight as to the injury
rate when runners change their footstrike either from rearfoot to
forefoot or from forefoot to rearfoot. Prospectively measuring
injury rates in those that have switched their footstrike is the
only definitive way to determine if one footstrike is more pro-
tective against injury than the other.
Until recently, the inconclusive and speculative links
between impact characteristics and running injury risk were the
only evidence to support that mid- or forefoot strikers may be
beneficial for preventing injury. The author of a previous review
paper found little to no evidence to support that alternative
running styles (i.e., a forefoot strike) such as from shod using a
rearfoot strike were beneficial.76 To our knowledge, Daoud
et al.42 published the first cohort study that suggested that the
occurrence of injuries was reduced in those that habitually used

 a mid- or forefoot strike compared to a rearfoot strike. Their
study reported a statistically greater incidence of running inju-
ries per 10,000 miles of running using a rearfoot strike com-
pared with a mid- or forefoot strike when the data were
combined across sex and level of injury severity or both. When
the data were separated by sex and injury severity type, the only
statistically significant difference was observed between female
mid- or forefoot runners (n = 5) and the female rearfoot runners
(n = 18).Although this study was an informative first look at the
rate of injury between footfall patterns, it was retrospective in
design, used a very specific sample of runners (i.e., Division 1
Cross Country Collegiate Athletes) and had a relatively small
sample size.42
To conclusively assess the risk of incurring an injury, pro-
spective, epidemiologic studies with a large sample size must
be conducted in those who have switched footstrike patterns.
Unfortunately, such studies are not prominent in the running
injury literature to date. To conduct a large prospective study, a
large number of participants who utilized different footfall pat-
terns need to be followed over a significant period of time.
During the time that they are followed, the participants should
maintain their usual training schedule and report on any injury
that is sustained. In 3 relatively large-scale epidemiologic
studies, investigators reported the injury risk on samples of
47176 and 120377 runners and a sample of 341 male U.S. army
soldiers.78 The results in these studies were similar. Neither
study reported statistically significant differences in the injury
rates between habitual rearfoot and mid- or forefoot strikers.
The 2 epidemiologic studies of Kleindienst76 and Walther77
reported a difference in the injury site and the type of injury
incurred between footstrike pattern groups. In those 2 studies,
the most prevalent injuries that were incurred were midfoot
dorsal pain, metatarsal stress fractures, Achilles tendinitis, and
post tibial tendinitis. In another study, Warr et al.79 did not find
a difference in injury rates, running mileage, or 2-mile run time
between footstrike groups, indicating no performance or injury
prevention benefits for either footstrike pattern.
More prospective randomized control trials investigating the
risk of injury in both forefoot and rearfoot running are needed.
The question of whether mid- or forefoot striking reduces
running-related injuries compared with rearfoot running cannot
be answered completely without such studies. The current claim
that runners running using a mid- or forefoot strike have fewer
running-related injuries than those running with a rearfoot
strike is speculation at best and so far is unsupported by pro-
spective epidemiologic studies.
6. Conclusion
Research conducted on the efficacy of changing one’s
footstrike from a rearfoot to a mid- or forefoot strike suggests that
there is no obvious benefit to such a change for the majority of
runners. In fact, it may be that the change in footstrike may result
in stressing tissue that is not normally stressed when running
with one’s habitual pattern, thus leading to the possibility of
incurring a secondary injury. Changing one’s footstrike to a mid-
or forefoot strike may be beneficial to some but, based on the
current biomechanical, physiological, and epidemiologic litera-
ture, it should not recommended for the majority of runners,
particularly those who are recreational runners.
In summary, there are 3 key points: (1) the scientific basis for
encouraging runners to change their footstrike pattern is not
warranted; (2) there is little conclusive scientific evidence that
a mid- or forefoot strike improves running economy, eliminates
a vertical impact force at the foot-ground contact, or reduces
the risk of running-related injuries; and (3) there is a need for
large, prospective randomized control trials investigating the
risk of injury in both forefoot and rearfoot running.
