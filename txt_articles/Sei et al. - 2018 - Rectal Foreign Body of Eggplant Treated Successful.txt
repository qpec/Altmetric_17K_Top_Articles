Abstract 
Transanal rectal foreign body implies that a foreign body has been inserted transanally due 
to sexual orientation or other reasons and cannot be removed. Such cases require emergen-
cy measures because foreign bodies often present difficulties in manual removal or endo-
scopic removal and may even require surgery when peritonitis due to gastrointestinal perfo-
ration occurs. We report a patient in our hospital who had a rectal foreign body inserted into 
the deep part of the proctosigmoid that could be removed endoscopically. A 66-year-old 
man visited our hospital because of an eggplant which had been inserted into his rectum by 
his friend and could not be removed. Since plain abdominal computed tomography showed 
a foreign body thought to be an eggplant in the proctosigmoid, the foreign body was cap-
tured and removed with a snare under lower gastrointestinal endoscope guidance.

Introduction 
It has been reported that most rectal foreign bodies are inserted transanally for the pur-
pose of aberrant sexual propensity, other than for medical purposes [1]. In many cases, such 
foreign bodies are hard to remove endoscopically, and patients with large foreign bodies are 
at high risk associated with gastrointestinal perforation. Therefore, an abdominal operation 
is often required in such patients. We report a patient who had an eggplant with a diameter 
of about 20 mm in the rectum, which was removed using a polypectomy snare successfully. 
Case Presentation 
A 66-year-old man presented with an eggplant which had been inserted into his rectum 
by his friend while the patient was drunk. On the next day, he visited a nearby hospital be-
cause the eggplant could not be removed. After a foreign body in the rectum was palpated by 
rectal examination, the patient was referred to our hospital. His past history showed that he 
was on medication for type II diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. His condition on the 
first hospital visit was as follows: conscious; a body temperature of 36.5°C; abdominal area 
flat and soft without tenderness; a mass was palpated in the abdominal region. No obvious 
inflammation was found in blood biochemistry findings. Plain abdominal computed tomog-
raphy revealed an approximately 20-cm-long mass mainly composed of air density from the 
upper sigmoid to the upper rectum (Fig. 1). Remarkable intestinal deformity was observed, 
while there were no clear findings of perforation and ascites. The patient had abdominal 
pain. We tried removal of the eggplant endoscopically without anesthesia after he had been 
adequately informed. Since emergent lower gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed that the 
calyx of the eggplant in the rectosigmoid faced the anal side (Fig. 2a), the constriction of the 
calyx was grasped with a snare (CaptivatorTM II, 33 mm; Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) 
(Fig. 2b) and was removed slowly in the left lateral decubitus position, while taking care that 
the snare did not fall out and the eggplant was not cut off (Fig. 2c). After the procedure, we 
observed the site from the sigmoid colon to the rectal mucosa and confirmed that there was 
no overt hemorrhage or perforation. In addition, after the removal of the eggplant, ab-
dominal discomfort improved and his course was good. 
Discussion 
This article describes a case in which an eggplant, as a rectal foreign body, could be re-
moved endoscopically using a polypectomy snare. Recently, it was reported that the inci-
dence of rectal foreign bodies has increased and that there are many such cases involving a 
bottle or a glass (42.2%) [1]. Most cases in which foreign bodies are inserted transanally are 
associated with sexual acts [1]. Some patients may visit a hospital after a long time has 
passed because of their sense of shame or because they do not want to report their medical 
history in detail. Therefore, attention should be paid to such patients. Concerning rectal for-
eign bodies, such as sexual toys with smooth margins, there are several cases in which re-
moval of foreign bodies under lower gastrointestinal endoscope guidance was tried. Howev-

er, there are a lot of cases in which foreign bodies were hard to remove endoscopically and 
where gastrointestinal perforation occurred and the treatment method was switched to one 
of abdominal operation. Generally, in the following circumstances, rectal foreign bodies are 
thought to be associated with a risk of gastrointestinal perforation: the time after insertion 
of the foreign bodies was long and the intestinal tract is extended by them, resulting in ede-
ma and circulatory disturbance; the leading part of the foreign bodies is sharp. The reasons 
why foreign bodies are hard to remove are the following: (1) after large foreign bodies have 
been inserted into the rectum, local edema occurs and convulsions of the anal sphincter oc-
cur; (2) when long foreign bodies are inserted, they are fixed on the pelvic surface of the 
sacrum and the anal canal; (3) the inner pressure of the rostral portion of the intestine be-
comes negative by the extraction of foreign bodies; and (4) depending on the shape and the 
materials of foreign bodies, they may be hard to grasp because of attached blood and muco-
sa. Given the above issues, as the basic treatment strategy for rectal foreign bodies, it is 
common that an abdominal operation is initially considered for patients in whom evidence 
of peritonitis has been obtained from the medical history, physical examination, and imaging 
studies. Manual removal or endoscopic removal should be considered for patients without 
evidence of peritonitis. Since our patient showed low evidence of inflammation by blood 
examination and showed no peritoneal signs of irritation, we tried removal of the eggplant 
endoscopically after he had been adequately informed. 
To date, in 10 reports in which rectal foreign bodies were removed under endoscope 
guidance, foreign bodies were removed using a snare or forceps for polypectomy and using a 
urinary balloon (Table 1) [2–10]. In addition, different types of foreign bodies commonly 
include vibrators, bottles, fruits, cigar cases, etc. There is no report on an eggplant as a for-
eign body as in our report. Our patient showed no apparent mucosal injury after the endo-
scopic removal of the foreign body. However, it is necessary to observe the mucosa by endo-
scope again after the removal because patients may develop intestinal mucosal injury result-
ing in bleeding and perforation while foreign bodies are removed. 
We report a patient who had an eggplant with a length of 20 cm in the rectum, which 
was successfully removed by grasping the calyx of the eggplant using a polypectomy snare 
without mucosal injury. Since the holding force of a polypectomy snare is strong and is un-
likely to damage the gastrointestinal mucosa, it was thought to be useful for the removal of 
large foreign bodies, such as an eggplant, with a smooth surface.
