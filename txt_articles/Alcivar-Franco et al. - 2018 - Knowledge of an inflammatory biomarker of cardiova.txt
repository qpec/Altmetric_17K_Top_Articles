Abstract
Objective: Diabetes is a risk equivalent for cardiovascular events. The increase in vascular
inflammation with diabetes is believed to be responsible for increased risk of ischemic events
in diabetic patients. Our goal was to assess whether knowledge of vascular inflammation alters
cardiovascular risk over time, and how knowledge of vascular inflammation changes risk in non-
diabetic, pre-diabetic and diabetic patients.
Methods: We retrospectively studied >100,000 primary-care patients per annum for 5 years
(baseline in 2011 through 2015) with tests including lipoprotein profile, hemoglobin A1C and the
vascular-specific inflammation risk marker myeloperoxidase. Results were obtained during the
patient’s MD Value In Prevention (MDVIP) annual wellness program physical.
Results: We show that rates of patients with elevated myeloperoxidase levels were reduced
from 14.4%, 15.2% and 21.3% to 4.0%, 4.0% and 6.7% in non-diabetic, pre-diabetic and diabetic
patients, respectively, over the 5-year period. Decreases in vascular inflammation were achieved
without decreases in the prevalence of pre-diabetes (hemoglobin A1C 5.7%–6.4%) or diabetes
(hemoglobin A1C >6.4%) and were observed in patients below or above guideline low-density
lipoprotein targets.
Conclusions: These data demonstrate that physicians informed of elevated markers of vascular
inflammation can lower vascular inflammation correlating with biomarker-based decreased risk of
cardiovascular events.

Introduction
Cardiovascular disease continues to be the
leading cause of mortality in the US, where
nearly one-third of deaths can be directly
attributed to a cardiovascular event. The
growing increase in the prevalence of pre-
diabetes and diabetes has changed the
underlying risk profile of cardiovascular
disease from one focused on cholesterol
levels to one of vascular inflammation.
Diabetes is a risk equivalent for cardiovas-
cular disease because diabetics without a
history
of
acute
myocardial
infarction
(AMI) have the same likelihood of an
AMI as non-diabetic patients with a history
of AMI. Diabetes has been linked to an
increased drive of vascular inflammation
through
multiple
mechanisms
including
lipid oxidation, advanced glycation end-
products and increased insulin levels.
Assessing risk factors of cardiovascular
disease and screening for coronary artery
disease (CAD) and its equivalents like dia-
betes have been the goal of the American
College of Cardiology and the American
Heart Association. They have tried to
implement
simple
and
evidence-based
guidelines with high-sensitivity screening
at a relatively low cost. After withdrawing
the target goal for low-density lipoprotein
(LDL) treatment in the new guidelines, it
remains uncertain how successful we really
are at controlling patients at risk and who
would require further treatment and more
aggressive strategies. This is important in
light of recent data showing that approxi-
mately 50% of patients admitted with CAD
and acute ischemic events have acceptable
cholesterol levels.1
The link between atherosclerosis, clinical
events and inflammation has been recog-
nized for years and is well established.2
The recent findings of the Canakinumab
Anti-inflammatory Thrombosis Outcomes
Study (CANTOS) validated the concept
that targeting inflammation is a good strat-
egy to prevent clinical events in patients
with atherosclerosis.3 There is growing rec-
ognition of the physiology represented by
the measurement of novel markers of oxi-
dation and inflammation.4 Two markers,
lipoprotein-associated
phospholipase
A2
(Lp-PLA2) and myeloperoxidase (MPO)),
are markers of vulnerable plaque and risk
of clinical events.2,5–7 Although it is unclear
that
the
inhibition
of
either
of
these
enzymes
would
have
clinical
benefit,8,9
increased circulating levels of these markers
are linked to increased risk of stroke and
AMI.
In this study, we assessed whether the
addition of a marker of vascular inflamma-
tion
to
advanced
cholesterol
measures
annually
in
a
primary-care
population
would lead to the long-term, down-regula-
tion of cardiovascular risk. In recognition
of the changing landscape of cardiovascular
risk assessment, MD Value In Prevention
(MDVIP) added MPO to their annual well-
ness panel in 2011. In this study, we present
the findings of >100,000 patients who had
these wellness panels yearly. Our objectives
were to examine whether knowledge of vas-
cular inflammation altered cardiovascular
2

 risk over time, and how knowledge of vas-
cular inflammation changed the cardiovas-
cular risk of non-diabetic, pre-diabetic and
diabetic patients.
Methods
As part of its wellness services, MDVIP
implements an annual screening panel to
all enrolled patients. The wellness screening
panel focuses on known risk factors for car-
diovascular
disease
including
diabetes
(hemoglobin A1C; HbA1C), an advanced
lipid panel, apolipoprotein A1 and MPO.
Results from de-identified patients tested
from 2011 to 2015 followed by 801 physi-
cian
practices
were
captured
from
Cleveland
HeartLab’s
Laboratory
Information System and encompassed all
MDVIP
wellness
testing
performed
between
January
2011
and
December
2015. Results for LDL testing were provid-
ed
by
three
laboratories
(88%
from
Atherotech
Vertical
Auto
Profile,
10%
from Liposcience nuclear magnetic reso-
nance profile
and 2%
from Cleveland
HeartLab standard lipid panel).
Extracted data were cleaned by trans-
forming all test results that indicated a
value above or below the test analytical
range (using a “<” or “>”) to their numeric
value. Records with test results indicating
that the test was not performed (for any
reason) were deleted. Clinical cutoffs for
HbA1c used in the study were as follows:
non-diabetic, <5.7%; pre-diabetic, 5.7%–
6.4%; and diabetic, >6.4%. Based on
guideline LDL targets for diabetics and
non-diabetics without heart disease, analy-
ses were stratified for LDL <100 mg/dL
and <130 mg/dL.
Physician
experience
associated
with
each test result was calculated by determin-
ing the difference (in months) between the
test order date and the date of the first test
order for each ordering physician. The dis-
tribution of physician experience over the
entire study was determined to be 24%
with 0–12 months of experience, 17% with
12–24 months, 13% with 25–36 months,
13% with 37–48 months and 32% with
49–60 months.
Ethics committee review was not neces-
sary as this study was a retrospective anal-
ysis of Laboratory Information System
data with no patient identifiers or informa-
tion available. Furthermore, all MDVIP
patients in their agreement with MDVIP
consent that their data can be used for
blinded analyses.
Results
We studied >100,000 patients per year of
the MDVIP annual wellness panels between
2011 and 2015. Overall,
approximately
645,000 total patient visits from 285,901
unique
patients
were
analyzed
(2011:
104,608 patients; 2012: 115,864 patients;
2013:
125,193
patients;
2014:
140,764;
2015: 159,300 patients). These included
approximately
623,000
LDL,
598,000
HbA1C and 603,000 MPO results. A total
of 79.5% of patient visits were for patients
who had testing done in multiple years.
The data in Figure 1 depict the trends for
prevalence of diabetic, pre-diabetic and
non-diabetic
patients
based
on
annual
HbA1C. The prevalence of diabetes was
9%–11%, pre-diabetes was 41.1%–46.7%
and
non-diabetes
was
42.3%–47.2%.
Thus, in any year, >50% of the patient
population were at risk of or diagnosed
with diabetes.
As seen in Figure 2, in the first year of
testing diabetic patients we noted a 21.3%
positivity rate for MPO compared with
14.4% for non-diabetics. The MPO positiv-
ity rate in pre-diabetics was 15.2%. Over
the 5 years, the rate of MPO positivity
steadily
decreased to 6.7%, 4.0% and
4.0% for diabetics, pre-diabetics and non-
diabetic patients, respectively, in 2015; i.e.,
a 68.5%, 73.7% and 72.2% reduction in

 risk annually for a cardiovascular event in
these three groups, respectively.
We investigated the prevalence of patients
at typical LDL targets based on National
Cholesterol
Education
Program
Adult
Treatment Panel (ATP) III (<100 mg/dL
for diabetics and <130 mg/dL for pre-
diabetics and non-diabetics; see Figure 3).
The number of diabetic patients at LDL
goal was always >57% of the population
and in 2014 reached a high of 71%. For
non-diabetics and pre-diabetics with the
higher LDL goal of 130 mg/dL, the percent-
age of patients at LDL goal was between
76% and 84%. Importantly, there was no
correlation between lowering of LDL and
lowering of the prevalence of patients with
positive MPO in diabetics, pre-diabetics or
non-diabetics, suggesting that modulation of
risk associated with presence of a positive
marker of vascular inflammation was dis-
tinct from simply lowering cholesterol levels.

 Although
the
prevalence
of
patients
with evidence of vascular inflammation
decreased from 2011 to 2015 (Figure 4),
the percentage of patients with a positive
MPO and controlled cholesterol levels did
not. In 2011, 59.2%, 77.0% and 77.1% of
diabetics, pre-diabetics and non-diabetic
patients, respectively, who had a positive
MPO also had cholesterol levels at goal.
In 2015, those percentages were 61.2%,
80.0% and 80.0%, and not significantly
changed
from
2011
relative
to
the
significant decrease in the overall preva-
lence of positive MPO.
The data in Figure 5 explore the relation-
ship between the number of years a physi-
cian was aware of and ordered an MPO test
and the
prevalence
of
positive
results.
Although the prevalence of diabetes and
patients with LDL levels above goal does
not appear to change, the prevalence of
positive MPO levels decreases within the
year after the physician begins to measure
vascular inflammation.

 Discussion
The response-to-injury hypothesis of ath-
erosclerosis proposes that the atherosclerot-
ic process is initiated through arterial injury
and is propagated in response to subse-
quent inflammation.10–12 Periods of episod-
ic inflammation lead to the degradation of
stable atherosclerotic plaque and then to
vulnerable
plaque
formation.
Rupture
of vulnerable plaque can lead to growth of
the atherosclerotic plaque or intra-arterial
thrombosis
and
end
organ
ischemia.13
Multiple studies have shown that knowl-
edge of both the inflammatory state and
lipid status allows additive information for
risk.14,15
The work of Ridker and colleagues has
demonstrated the utility of measuring arterial
inflammation in patients with a narrow range
of the non-specific marker high-sensitivity C-
reactive protein (hsCRP; <10 mg/L) as a
marker of cardiovascular risk, even after cor-
recting for lipoprotein levels, age, and other
accepted cardiovascular risk factors. The

Primary
Prevention:
An
Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin
(JUPITER) randomized double blind trial
demonstrated that risk reduction in patients
based on inflammatory markers leads to
reduction of events and mortality.16
Multiple studies have demonstrated the
utility of measuring the circulating of free
myeloperoxidase as a correlate of the risk of
presence of vulnerable plaque.2,5,17 Heslop
et al.2 showed that patients who underwent
elective coronary angiography had a 5-fold
increased hazard ratio for mortality if either
MPO or hsCRP was elevated, but they had
a further 4.33-fold increase in hazard ratio
if both MPO and hsCRP were elevated.
We have previously modeled the poten-
tial return on investment for a commercial
health insurance plan with one million
members. An estimated 43,693 cardiovascu-
lar events were estimated to occur over
5 years under a standard-of-care scenario,
whereas
a
biomarker
testing
approach
using hsCRP, MPO and Lp-PLA2 could
yield an estimated reduction of events
by 8.9% (3,908 events) over 5 years.18

 prevalence of patients with positive MPO in
Figure 2 is reminiscent of the decline in
hsCRP seen in the CANTOS trial with the
interleukin 1 beta monoclonal antibody
canakinumab.3 Thus, our findings suggest
that vascular inflammation can be signifi-
cantly lowered in patients without the
need for expensive biologics.19
The goal of this study was to determine
the extent to which a patient’s risk could be
reduced through the measurement of MPO
and the knowledge of inflammatory risk.
Our data demonstrate that within one
year of using MPO as a marker of cardio-
vascular risk, the number of patients at risk
decreased. Not surprisingly, our data dem-
onstrate that the probability of an abnor-
mal
MPO
is
greater
in
patients
with
HbA1C
>6.4%.
We
demonstrate
that,
based on inflammatory risk as measured
by MPO, by year 5 patients with HbA1C
between 5.7% and 6.4% was reduced to
that
of
patients
with
HbA1C
<5.7%.
Furthermore, the percentage of patients
positive for MPO in these two groups was
decreased by 73% over the 5-year period of
our study. Patients with HbA1C >6.4%
had residual risk based on MPO, but the
percentage of patients with positive MPO
was reduced by 69% over the 5 years stud-
ied. Finally, the trends of positive MPO we
observed in different groups of patients
based on HbA1C were similar whether or
not patients had LDL levels at target based
on ATPIII.
These data demonstrate that primary-
care physicians can and will respond to
increased
cardiovascular
risk
based
on
inflammatory
markers.
Future
studies
need to focus on strategies implemented
by these physicians that led to decreases in
MPO. Because the percentage of patients
with LDL levels greater than goal did not
change over the 5 years studied, it is unlike-
ly that the medical approach had to do with
simply increasing the use or dosing of lipid-
lowering therapies.
Conclusion
There is growing recognition of the need to
identify novel strategies to risk stratify
patients for cardiovascular events. With at
least 50% of patients presenting with acute
coronary syndromes having LDL levels at
guideline levels based on ATP III or on
statin therapy based on current guidelines,
there
is
a
growing
need
to
identify
biomarkers
other
than
lipoproteins.
Biomarkers based on vascular inflamma-
tion seem to be a rational approach given
the increasing prevalence of obesity and
diabetes, both of which are linked to
increased
levels
of
inflammation.
Our
study shows that vascular inflammation as
measured by MPO is modifiable in this
MDVIP population of patients. Future
studies will need to define the strategies
implemented to lower vascular inflamma-
tion and whether modification of MPO in
this patient group led to a reduction in car-
diovascular events.
