IMPORTANCE Recent studies have yielded conflicting results as to whether testosterone
treatment increases cardiovascular risk.
OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that testosterone treatment of older men with low
testosterone slows progression of noncalcified coronary artery plaque volume.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial at 9 academic
medical centers in the United States. The participants were 170 of 788 men aged 65 years or
older with an average of 2 serum testosterone levels lower than 275 ng/dL (82 men assigned
to placebo, 88 to testosterone) and symptoms suggestive of hypogonadism who were
enrolled in the Testosterone Trials between June 24, 2010, and June 9, 2014.
INTERVENTION Testosterone gel, with the dose adjusted to maintain the testosterone level
in the normal range for young men, or placebo gel for 12 months.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was noncalcified coronary artery
plaque volume, as determined by coronary computed tomographic angiography. Secondary
outcomes included total coronary artery plaque volume and coronary artery calcium score
(range of 0 to >400 Agatston units, with higher values indicating more severe atherosclerosis).
RESULTS Of 170 men who were enrolled, 138 (73 receiving testosterone treatment and 65
receiving placebo) completed the study and were available for the primary analysis. Among
the 138 men, the mean (SD) age was 71.2 (5.7) years, and 81% were white. At baseline,
70 men (50.7%) had a coronary artery calcification score higher than 300 Agatston units,
reflecting severe atherosclerosis. For the primary outcome, testosterone treatment
compared with placebo was associated with a significantly greater increase in noncalcified
plaque volume from baseline to 12 months (from median values of 204 mm3 to 232 mm3 vs
317 mm3 to 325 mm3, respectively; estimated difference, 41 mm3; 95% CI, 14 to 67 mm3;
P = .003). For the secondary outcomes, the median total plaque volume increased from
baseline to 12 months from 272 mm3 to 318 mm3 in the testosterone group vs from 499 mm3
to 541 mm3 in the placebo group (estimated difference, 47 mm3; 95% CI, 13 to 80 mm3;
P = .006), and the median coronary artery calcification score changed from 255 to 244
Agatston units in the testosterone group vs 494 to 503 Agatston units in the placebo group
(estimated difference, −27 Agatston units; 95% CI, −80 to 26 Agatston units). No major
adverse cardiovascular events occurred in either group.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among older men with symptomatic hypogonadism,
treatment with testosterone gel for 1 year compared with placebo was associated with a
significantly greater increase in coronary artery noncalcified plaque volume, as measured by
coronary computed tomographic angiography. Larger studies are needed to understand the
clinical implications of this finding.

A
lthough testosterone replacement is increasingly
being used clinically,1 the cardiovascular benefits and
risks of testosterone administration to older men with
age-related decline in testosterone levels remain uncertain.
Several observational studies show an inverse association
between serum testosterone concentration and adverse car-
diovascular outcomes, the metabolic syndrome, diabetes,
and mortality,2-5 independent of traditional cardiovascular
risk factors.
Studies of the effects of testosterone on clinical cardio-
vascular outcomes are conflicting.6 Meta-analyses of clinical
trials have shown no association between testosterone treat-
ment and cardiovascular adverse events, but none of the in-
dividual trials included in the meta-analyses were designed to
assess these events prospectively. A clinical trial in older men
with mobility limitation showed an excess of cardiovascular
adverseeventsinmentreatedwithtestosteronecomparedwith
placebo,7 but another trial in a similar population did not.8
Thesetrialswerealsonotdesignedtoassesscardiovascularad-
verse events. Retrospective analyses of electronic medical rec-
ords to evaluate the possible association of testosterone treat-
ment with cardiovascular adverse events have also yielded
conflicting results.9-13
The Testosterone Trials (TTrials), a group of 7 placebo-
controlled, coordinated trials, were designed to determine the
efficacyoftestosteronetreatmentofmenaged65yearsorolder
with low testosterone concentrations for no apparent reason
other than age. The Cardiovascular Trial was designed to test
the hypothesis that testosterone treatment of older men with
low testosterone slows the progression of noncalcified coro-
nary artery plaque volume, assessed by coronary computed
tomographic angiography (CCTA), as an indicator of coronary
atherosclerosis.
Methods
Study Design
The overall study design of the TTrials14 as well as the design
of the Cardiovascular Trial15 have been published. To qualify
for the TTrials overall, a participant had to qualify for at least
1 of the 3 main trials (Sexual Function Trial, Physical Func-
tion Trial, and Vitality Trial). Those who qualified overall could
participate in any of the others for which they qualified. Par-
ticipants were allocated to receive testosterone or placebo gel
for 1 year. This article describes the results of the Cardiovas-
cular Trial.
TheTTrialsandtheCardiovascularTrialprotocolswereap-
proved by the institutional review boards of the participating
sites. The trial protocols for the TTrials and the Cardiovascu-
lar Trial are available in Supplement 1. All participants pro-
vided written informed consent. Participant safety and trial
conduct were overseen by an independent data and safety
monitoring board.
Participants
Participants were recruited primarily by mass mailings.16 Re-
spondentswerescreenedbytelephoneandthenduring2clinic
visits.Themainoverallinclusioncriteriaweremenaged65years
or older, serum testosterone levels that averaged lower than
275ng/dL(toconverttonanomolesperliter,multiplyby0.0347)
on 2 morning samples, and subjective complaints and objec-
tive evidence of sexual dysfunction, physical dysfunction,
and/or reduced vitality. The main exclusion criterion was high
risk of prostate cancer.14 Men who had a history of myocardial
infarction or stroke within the previous 3 months and who had
a systolic blood pressure higher than 160 mm Hg or diastolic
blood pressure higher than 100 mm Hg were excluded.
Additional exclusion criteria for the Cardiovascular Trial
were related to CCTA: conditions that either increased the risk
of performing the procedure (estimated glomerular filtration
rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or known allergy to iodinated con-
trast medium) or made the procedure technically impractical
(weight >136 kg, inability to hold the breath for 10 seconds,
a prior diagnosis of tachycardia or irregular heart rhythm
[eg,atrialfibrillation],orhistoryofcoronaryarterybypassgraft
surgery). Self-report of race and ethnicity, by fixed categories,
was collected as required by the National Institutes of Health.
Testosterone Treatment
Participants were allocated to treatment by minimization, a
computerized allocation technique that calculates the assign-
ment that provides the best balance across groups on speci-
fied baseline characteristics. A random component was
included by assigning the optimally balancing treatment with
80% probability.14 The balancing variables included partici-
pation in the main trials, trial site, age younger than or older
than 75 years, screening testosterone concentration lower
than or higher than 200 ng/dL, and use of antidepressants
and phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors.14 There was
only 1 treatment assignment that applied to all trials in which
a man participated.
Testosterone was administered as a 1% gel in a pump
bottle (AndroGel). Placebo gel was similar. The dose was ini-
tially 5 g/d and was adjusted, if necessary, on the basis of tes-
tosterone levels measured at a central laboratory (Quest
Clinical Trials) at months 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9, to try to keep the
serum concentration within the normal range for young men
(280-873 ng/dL). To maintain blinding when the dose was
adjusted in a man receiving testosterone treatment, the dose
was changed simultaneously in a man receiving placebo.
Key Points
Question Is testosterone treatment of older men with low
testosterone associated with a decrease in noncalcified coronary
artery plaque volume?
Findings In a controlled clinical trial, 1 year of testosterone
treatment of men aged 65 years or older with a low serum
testosterone level was associated with a significant increase
in noncalcified coronary artery plaque volume of 41 mm3 more
than placebo.
Meaning Testosterone treatment of older men was associated
with an increase in coronary artery plaque volume, but additional
studies are needed to determine the clinical significance.

Assessments
The concentrations of testosterone, free testosterone, and
estradiol were measured on serum samples drawn at baseline
and months 3, 6, 9, and 12 and stored at −80°C. These assays
were performed at the Brigham Research Assay Core as previ-
ously described.17
Coronary artery plaque volume was assessed by CCTA at
9 of the 12 TTrials clinical sites. Each of these sites had
at least a 64-slice CCTA scanner and staff experienced in CCTA,
asdeterminedbyaquestionnaire.15Precontrastscansforevalu-
ationofcoronaryarterycalciumdensityandpostcontrastscans
for evaluation of coronary artery plaque volume were per-
formed at baseline and 12 months. If a participant who had a
baseline scan developed an allergy to contrast medium or ex-
perienced a decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate to
60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or less before the month 12 scan, only the
precontrast scan was performed at month 12.
All scans were evaluated at a central reading center
(Harbor-UCLA Medical Center) by an investigator blinded to
treatment assignment. Coronary images were transferred to
the workstation with the use of semiautomated plaque analy-
sis software (QAngioCT Research Edition Version 2.0.5;
Medis Medical Imaging Systems) and evaluated using a pro-
tocol for quantitative plaque assessment.18,19 Vessel diam-
eters greater than 1.5 mm were evaluated and assessed based
on a Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography
17-segment coronary artery model.20
The readers (R.N., N.N., and S.M.), blinded to both treat-
mentgroupanddateofscan,evaluatedthebaselineandmonth
12 scans side by side to ensure that the same segments were
compared and measured. The area of each coronary plaque vi-
sualized in at least 2 adjacent slices (reconstructed slice thick-
nessof0.6mm)wasdeterminedonallaffectedslices.Thetotal
plaque volume per segment was summed over all segments
with plaque. In addition, each coronary territory (right coro-
nary artery, left main artery, left anterior descending artery,
and left circumflex artery) was scored according to presence
of the most significant lesion.
The volumes of 4 types of coronary artery plaque—low
attenuation, fibrous-fatty, fibrous, and dense calcium—were
calculated by the Hounsfield unit threshold. The Hounsfield
unit threshold was changed dynamically by the software, as
plaque attenuation values are affected by luminal contrast
densities.21 The primary outcome was noncalcified plaque
volume, defined as the sum of the low attenuation, fibrous-
fatty, and fibrous plaque volumes. (The primary outcome
was originally [October 2010] total plaque volume but was
changed to noncalcified plaque volume in the final protocol
of October 2012 [Supplement 1]. Determination of plaque vol-
ume was not made until all participants had completed the
trial in June 2014.) The secondary outcomes were (1) total
plaque volume, defined as the sum of the volume of all 4
types of coronary artery plaque volume (low attenuation,
fibrous-fatty, fibrous, and dense calcium); and (2) coronary
artery calcium score. The exploratory outcomes were the 4
individual components of plaque volume.
Reproducibility of the coronary artery plaque volume
readings in the reading center was assessed by dividing the
analyzed scans into quartiles based on noncalcified plaque
volume and selecting 10 scans from each quartile to ensure
representation of the full range of plaque volumes. One origi-
nal reader read each of the 40 scans once, and a new reader
read each twice, a week apart and in a different order. Intrao-
bserver and interobserver reliability for the primary outcome
of noncalcified plaque volume was assessed using linear
regression and Bland-Altman plots. The intraclass correla-
tions (ICCs) and coefficients of variation (CVs) were also cal-
culated. For noncalcified plaque volume, the intraobserver
CV was 7.8%, the intraobserver ICC was 0.99, the interob-
server CV was 19.9%, and the interobserver ICC was 0.95.
The intraobserver and interobserver variability was greater
for some of the individual plaque components. Details are
provided in the eAppendix, eFigure 1, eFigure 2, and eTable 1
in Supplement 2.
Coronary artery calcium score, a secondary outcome, was
determined on precontrast scans as previously described.22
Statistical Analyses
The association of testosterone with outcomes related to
coronary artery plaque and calcium scores was assessed
using a multivariable linear model that adjusted for baseline
plaque volume and all balancing variables used in the mini-
mization procedure: study site, indicator variables of partici-
pation in each primary efficacy trial, baseline testosterone
concentration (≤200 ng/dL or >200 ng/dL), age (≤75 years or
>75 years), use of antidepressants, and use of PDE5 inhibitors
as covariables. The adjusted mean difference was calculated
for the change in plaque volume from baseline to month 12
for men allocated to testosterone compared with placebo. All
participants with measurements of both baseline and
12-month plaque volumes were included in the analysis. Sig-
nificance of the association between testosterone treatment
and plaque volume was assessed using the 2-sided Wald test
and 95% confidence interval. Assessment of the association
of the use of statins and assessment of change in testoste-
rone, free testosterone, and estradiol levels with change in
plaque volume for men assigned to testosterone treatment
were done by regression analysis, adjusting for balancing
variables and baseline plaque volume. A sensitivity analysis
to assess the potential effect of missing data was performed
by multiple imputation with all known and measured risk
factors for cardiovascular disease (age; body mass index
[calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in
meters squared]; smoking status; diabetes; hypertension;
prior myocardial infarction; prior stroke; revascularization;
sleep apnea; use of medications for diabetes, hypertension,
or lipid lowering; baseline plaque volumes; and baseline tes-
tosterone level) in addition to the balancing factors used to
develop the model. The Markov chain Monte Carlo method
was used to impute the missing values under the assumption
of an arbitrary missing pattern. No adjustments were made
for multiple testing. All hypothesis testing used a 2-sided
P = .05 significance threshold. All analyses were performed
using SAS version 9.4 statistical software (SAS Institute Inc).
The sample size for this trial was initially estimated
to be 400 men in the protocol of October 2010 but was

later reduced to 140 men when the primary outcome was
changed from total to noncalcified plaque volume, because
the latter has a smaller standard deviation.23 Using a stan-
dard deviation of 26 mm3 for the change in volume from
scans obtained at 2 time points approximately 1 year apart in
that study, 140 men (70 per group) with both baseline and
month 12 scans would provide 80% power to detect a differ-
ence of 12 mm3 in the change in noncalcified plaque volume
from baseline to 12 months (protocol of October 2012,
Supplement 1). This difference was chosen to be smaller
than the 14- to 15-mm3 difference seen between statin users
and nonusers.23
Results
Participants
Recruitment began on April 28, 2011. Targeted enrollment was
completed on June 11, 2013, and treatment was completed on
June 16, 2014. Of the 460 men enrolled in the TTrials at the 9
sites participating in the Cardiovascular Trial, 170 consented
and enrolled, and 166 had a baseline scan, 86 in the testoste-
rone group and 80 in the placebo group (Figure). A total of 138
men had a month 12 scan, 73 in the testosterone group and 65
in the placebo group, that could be analyzed. Nine men in the
testosterone group and 11 men in the placebo group did not
have month 12 scans even though they were still enrolled, be-
cause they either developed a reason for exclusion or refused
to have the second scan. eTable 2 in Supplement 2 shows the
numbersofmeninthistrialwhoparticipatedinthe3maintrials
of the TTrials.
At baseline, the mean (SD) age was 71.2 (5.7) years,
and 81% were white. The participants had relatively high
rates of obesity and concomitant illnesses, such as hyper-
tension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes, as well as relatively
high 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event by the American
College of Cardiology/American Heart Association risk
calculator24 (a mean risk of 24% [95% CI, 2.6%-45.4%] in the
testosterone group and 27% [95% CI, 6.4%-47.6%] in the pla-
cebo group) (Table 1). The prevalence of atherosclerosis,
assessed radiographically by a coronary artery calcification
score higher than 300 Agatston units, was also high (70 men
[50.7%] overall; 60.3% in the placebo group and 43.8% in the
testosterone group).
Testosterone treatment increased the serum testoste-
rone concentrations from unequivocally low to midnormal for
young men by month 3 and maintained that level through
month 12 (eFigure 3 in Supplement 2). Testosterone treat-
ment also increased the levels of free testosterone and estra-
diol to midnormal for young men.
CCTA and Coronary Artery Calcium Results
At baseline, noncalcified plaque volume showed consider-
able variability, and the median in the testosterone group
(204 mm3 [interquartile range, 60 to 420 mm3]) was some-
what lower than that in the placebo group (317 mm3 [inter-
quartile range, 168 to 589 mm3]) (Table 2). The components
of noncalcified plaque volume (low-attenuation plaque,
fibrous-fatty plaque, and fibrous plaque) and total plaque vol-
ume(noncalcifiedplaqueplusdensecalciumplaque)werealso
somewhat lower in the testosterone group (Table 2).
For the primary outcome, noncalcified coronary artery
plaque volume, testosterone treatment was associated with
a significantly greater increase from baseline to month 12
(from median of 204 mm3 to 232 mm3; change: mean,
40 mm3; 95% CI, 23 to 56 mm3) than placebo (from median
of 317 mm3 to 325 mm3; change: mean, 4 mm3; 95% CI, −14
to 22 mm3) (estimated difference, 41 mm3; 95% CI, 14 to
67 mm3; P = .003) (Table 2). Sensitivity analysis using mul-
tiple imputation to account for missing data resulted in
similar point estimates, and confidence intervals were al-
most identical (estimated difference, 39 mm3; 95% CI, 13 to
65 mm3). The P value for the difference in plaque volume in
this analysis was .003.
For the secondary outcome of total plaque volume, tes-
tosterone was significantly associated with a greater increase
from baseline to month 12 (from a median of 272 mm3 to
318 mm3; change: mean, 57 mm3; 95% CI, 35 to 78 mm3) than
placebo (from a median of 499 mm3 to 541 mm3; change:
mean, 21 mm3; 95% CI, 0 to 42 mm3) (estimated difference,
47 mm3; 95% CI, 13 to 80 mm3; P = .006). For the secondary
outcome of coronary artery calcium score, testosterone was
not statistically significantly associated with a change from
baseline to 12 months (change in testosterone group:
mean, 53 Agatston units; 95% CI, 25 to 82 Agatston units;
change in placebo group: mean, 118 Agatston units; 95% CI,
73 to 164 Agatston units). The median scores changed from
255 to 244 Agatston units in the testosterone group vs 494
to 503 Agatston units in the placebo group (estimated dif-
ference, −27 Agatston units; 95% CI, −80 to 26 Agatston
units; P = .31).
Exploratory analyses of the individual components of
noncalcified plaque showed that testosterone treatment was
associated with a significantly greater increase in fibrous
plaque volume (change, 25 mm3; 95% CI, 14 to 35 mm3) than
placebo (change, 1 mm3; 95% CI, −13 to 15 mm3) (estimated
difference, 24 mm3; 95% CI, 5 to 43 mm3; P = .01) (Table 2).
Testosterone was also associated with greater increases in
low-attenuation plaque volume and fibrous-fatty plaque vol-
ume, but neither difference reached statistical significance.
Testosterone and placebo were associated with almost iden-
tical (and not statistically significant) changes in dense cal-
cium plaque volume.
The change in noncalcified coronary artery plaque vol-
ume in men in the testosterone group was not associated with
changes in levels of total testosterone (r = −0.04; P = .74), free
testosterone (r = −0.006; P = .96), or estradiol (r = −0.08;
P = .50). The changes were also not associated with statin use
(P = .35). Differences in plaque volume were similar for men
with baseline coronary artery calcium scores higher and lower
than the median value.
Adverse Events

Discussion
One year of testosterone treatment of men aged 65 years or
older with low testosterone was associated with an increase
in noncalcified coronary artery plaque volume, as deter-
mined by CCTA. Testosterone treatment was also associated
with increased total plaque volume, but not with changes in
coronary artery calcium score.
Most of the men participating in the Cardiovascular Trial
had a severe amount of coronary atherosclerosis at baseline:
70 of 138 men (50.7%) had a coronary artery calcification score
higher than 300 Agatston units. Although men in the placebo
group at baseline had a somewhat greater mean coronary ar-
tery calcium score, as well as a somewhat greater mean non-
calcified plaque volume by CCTA, than men in the testoste-
rone group, these differences did not affect the comparison of
changes from baseline to month 12; analyses of associations

between testosterone and coronary artery calcium score were
adjusted for baseline values, and results of men with baseline
values higher than the median did not differ appreciably from
those with baseline values below the median.
Few prior studies have examined the effect of testoste-
rone on atherosclerosis in men. In a placebo-controlled trial
in middle-aged and older men, testosterone treatment for 3
years did not affect the change from baseline in coronary ar-
tery calcium score or common carotid artery intima-media
thickness.25 In the Cardiovascular Trial, testosterone treat-
ment,althoughfor1yearonly,wasnotassociatedwithachange
in the coronary artery calcium score.
Coronary computed tomographic angiography, as used in
the present trial, has the advantage over the coronary artery
calcium score of being able to detect noncalcified coronary
artery plaque and its components as well as calcified plaque.
Although a relatively new technique, it appears to give simi-
lar quantitative results to intravascular ultrasonography,26,27
and its excellent intraobserver and interobserver reproduc-
ibility for noncalcified plaque volume28,29 makes it feasible
for longitudinal studies. Noncalcified plaque volume, as de-
termined by CCTA, has been associated with myocardial
ischemia30 and subsequent cardiovascular adverse events.31

The increase in coronary artery noncalcified and total
plaque volumes in men treated with testosterone is concern-
ing because any limitation of the vascular lumen could be
considered deleterious.32 The clinical significance of these
increases could depend on the differential effects of testoste-
rone on the individual components of noncalcified plaque.
Testosterone treatment was associated with a significant
increase in the volume of fibrous plaque, which may be more
stable than other types of plaque.33 A recent review, however,
concluded that total plaque burden may be more important
than the radiologic characteristics of individual plaques.32
This trial had several strengths, including a placebo-
controlled design, selection of men with unequivocally low
testosterone, and a relatively high retention rate. This study
also has limitations. One limitation is that the results apply
only to men aged 65 years or older who have low testoste-
rone. Another limitation is that the assumptions about the
composition of plaque components as detected by CCTA

have not been confirmed by direct radiologic-pathologic
studies. Furthermore, the volume and radiologic character-
istics of coronary artery plaques are only surrogate out-
comes and do not account for other factors that can influ-
ence the frequency and extent of plaque rupture and
thrombosis. The major limitation is that the trial was not
large enough or long enough to draw conclusions about the
risk of testosterone treatment on major adverse cardiovas-
cular events.
Conclusions
Among older men with symptomatic hypogonadism, treat-
ment with testosterone gel for 1 year compared with placebo
was associated with a significantly greater increase in coro-
naryarterynoncalcifiedplaquevolume,asmeasuredbyCCTA.
Larger studies are needed to understand the clinical implica-
tions of this finding.
