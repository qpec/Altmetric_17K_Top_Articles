Dramatic global increases in future numbers of people with dementia have been predicted.
No multicentre population-based study powered to detect changes over time has reported
dementia incidence. MRC Cognitive Function and Ageing Study (CFAS) undertook baseline
interviews in populations aged 65 þ years in England and Wales (1989–1994). Three areas
(CFAS I) were selected for new sampling two decades later (2008–2011) with same
geographical boundaries, sampling and approach methods (CFAS II). At 2 years CFAS I
interviewed 5,156 (76% response) with 5,288 interviewed in CFAS II (74% response). Here
we report a 20% drop in incidence (95% CI: 0–40%), driven by a reduction in men across all
ages above 65. In the UK we estimate 209,600 new dementia cases per year. This study was
uniquely designed to test for differences across geography and time. A reduction of
age-specific incidence means that the numbers of people estimated to develop dementia in
any year has remained relatively stable.

ementia continues to be a topic of major international
interest
with
successive
reports
suggesting
large
increases throughout the world in the next decades1–4.
Following governmental concern and the 2013 G8 summit, the
World Dementia Council has been established to facilitate
greater attention both in research to support reduction of risk,
better diagnosis and treatments, and also support for those at
risk of, and with, the dementia syndrome. In contrast, new
emerging studies provide data that dementia occurrence might be
changeable across generations with both decreases and increases
reported5–9. During this time there have been considerable
changes in diagnostic practice, and it is a challenge to maintain
stability in
diagnostic and methodological
practice,
which
themselves could easily drive any changes seen in prevalence
and incidence.
Over the last two decades there has been an explosion of
interest in intermediate cognition with multiple and changing
diagnostic criteria, which now include biological measures10.
In the context of such rapid change, only studies where identical
diagnostic methods are maintained can provide any indication of
whether dementia occurrence in populations is truly changing.
When there are attempts to take changes into account in
meta-analyses of prevalence studies reported changes have been
shown to be, to a large extent, accounted for by these design and
clinical practice changes8. Where there has been an attempt to
control for changes in methodology and diagnostic thresholds the
general consensus from the small number of studies in the US
and Europe suggest lower prevalence at given ages, resulting in, at
least in the UK, relatively stability in estimation of overall
numbers of prevalent cases11. In two of the European studies
previous findings of higher risk in women are confirmed, with
much, if not all, of the drop in prevalence and incidence being
driven by a drop in the men’s rates8,12. A synthesis of European
studies suggests that further evidence from dedicated studies is
needed to provide definitive evidence on incidence13.
Many
risk
factors
for
dementia
have
changed
quite
dramatically over the last decades both increasing and decreasing
in prevalence and severity, with many linked to healthy vascular
systems14,
including
diabetes
and
metabolic
syndrome.
Education has also been transformed over the years with longer
years and greater expectations with associated reports of
improved
cognition
across
generations.
Although
there
is
limited trial evidence, estimates of the combination of these risk
factors’ impact on attributable risk suggests that up to 30% might
be ‘preventable’15. In addition, there is strong and continually
emerging evidence of the influence of cognitive, physical
and
social
engagement
‘‘protecting’’
or
compensating
for
existing neuropathology in the brain16–18. Cognition itself has
been improving within populations19–21. Given there have been
major changes in many Western and high-income societies in
these domains, the occurrence of dementia might change across
current generational cohorts.
Prevalence of dementia is the result of both incidence and
mortality, with incidence considered to be a more robust
comparator measure across time and geography because of
potential changes in differential mortality between those with and
without
dementia
and
changing
mortality
in
populations.
No direct comparison of incidence across time in multiple
areas, while maintaining identical methodological approaches,
has been conducted in the world to date. Here we report on the
first such study.
Incidence across the two decades has dropped by 20%
(95% confidence of interval (CI): 0–40%). This drop is driven
by a reduction in incidence among men at all ages. These
findings suggest that in the UK there are just under 210,000
incident cases per year, 74,000 men and 135,000 women.
This study was uniquely designed to test for differences in the
prevalence and incidence of dementia across geography and
time in diverse areas within a single country. A reduction of
age-specific incidence holding diagnostic methods steady means
that even in the presence of an ageing population the numbers
of people estimated to develop dementia in any year has
remained relatively stable, providing evidence that dementia in
whole populations can change.
Results
Baseline and follow-up numbers and characteristics. Details of
the
baseline
waves
for
each
study
have
been
presented
previously and are not repeated here11,22. Figure 1 shows
the flow of individuals within both the CFAS I and CFAS II
studies.
CFAS I: There were 7,635 individuals in the baseline screen, of
whom 1,459 took part in the assessment interview. Of these
individuals 900 took part in the 2 year follow-up where incidence
can be calculated directly. A further 4,256 took part in the
re-screen interview of whom 905 took part in the assessment so
dementia status at year 2 was seen (with unknown baseline
status). In total 1,660 (22%) were lost between waves (1,353 with
unknown dementia status at baseline) and there were 819 (11%)
deaths
(567
with
unknown
dementia
status
at
baseline).
Therefore, response at wave 2 was 76% in those still alive.
CFAS II: There were 7,762 individuals in the baseline and
assessment
interviews.
Of
these
5,288
took
part
in
the
re-interview, all can be used to calculate incidence directly.
A total of 1,831 (24%) were lost between waves and there were
643 deaths (8%). Response rate in those still alive at wave 2 was
74%, very similar to CFAS I. Supplementary table 1 shows the
numbers with dementia diagnosis in each study.
Incidence rates by age and sex. Incidence rates presented are
shown in those who were still alive at wave 2 (Table 1). The
overall incidence was 20.0 (95% CI: 16.9–23.8) per 1,000
person years in CFAS I and 17.7 (95% CI: 15.2–20.9) in CFAS II.
Incidence showed a decrease in most age/sex groups between the
two studies. Estimates in CFAS I are less precise due to the
sampling design and therefore smaller numbers in the assessment
stages. Incidence rates in CFAS I and II for six 5 year age groups
are shown in Fig. 2. The reduction in incidence is calculated as an
incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.8 (95% CI: 0.6–1.0, P ¼ 0.08, Poisson
regression, N ¼ 10,444).
There is evidence that the effect is different between men and
women (Fig. 3). In CFAS I, there was some evidence that women
had lower incidence than men (IRR women:men 0.7 (95% CI:
0.5–1.1, P ¼ 0.14), not seen in CFAS II (IRR 1.2 (95% CI: 0.9–1.6,
P ¼ 0.23). These effects appear to have been driven by a decrease
in the incidence seen in men 0.6 (95% CI: 0.4–0.9, P ¼ 0.007) but
not in women 1.0 (95% CI: 0.7–1.3, P ¼ 0.9).
Incidence rates by deprivation and area. Some effect of
deprivation is seen in the incidence rates in CFAS II (most versus
least IRR 1.5 (95% CI: 1.0–2.2)) but not CFAS I (IRR 1.0 (95% CI:
0.8–1.2), with higher incidence rates in the more deprived (CFAS
II trend P ¼ 0.05), however the effect is attenuated slightly after
adjustment for age and sex differences (trend P ¼ 0.16, IRR 1.3,
95% CI: 0.9–2.0) and further after additional adjustment for area
(trend P ¼ 0.27, IRR 1.3, 95% CI: 0.8–1.9, see Supplementary
Table 2), in CFAS I all P values 40.4. There is some variation in
the unadjusted incidence rates within the three areas, however
there is no evidence of a difference in incidence between the three
areas (Table 2, all P values 40.15 (unadjusted, adjusted for age
and sex, and adjusted for age, sex and area).

 Adjustment for initial non-response made little difference to
the estimates of incidence, as expected, as the effect of the weights
primarily apply to individuals with baseline dementia who by
definition are excluded in an incidence analysis (non-response
adjusted models used).
Population estimates of incidence cases. On the basis of these
models the incidence of dementia in individuals in the UK 1991
was estimated to be 183,000 per year. With no change in the
incidence rates, and the known increase in the older population
there would be expected to be 251,000 incidence cases per year in
the UK in 2015. On the basis of the new estimated incidence rates
seen in the population 209,600 people aged 65 and over would be
expected to develop dementia according to CFAS II criteria each
year. Figure 4 gives the number of incident cases by age group
each year in the UK, showing that more than 40,000 incident
cases occur every year in individuals aged 80–84, 85–89 and 90
and over despite the decreasing size of the general population at
these ages because of mortality.
Discussion
These findings provide the first multi-area evidence of a drop of
20% in incidence in the population aged 65 and over measured
directly, mostly observed in men. Our findings suggest that in the
UK there are just under 210,000 incident cases of dementia per
year, 74,000 in men and 135,000 in women. This represents a
far smaller increase than would have been expected from
extrapolation of earlier estimates. Deprivation may well be
associated with incidence, though this is more complex to
assess
than
prevalence,
due
to
the
relationship
between
deprivation and survival.
Limitations are unavoidable within such studies. The study is
based in three of the original areas, which were chosen to
represent the full range of prevalence estimates within MRC
CFAS and include urban and rural areas and diversity of
geographies. It would have been desirable to conduct the

 comparison across all areas but this was not fundable. A key
strength is that the sampling approach was primary care which in
the United Kingdom up to the time of this study was largely on
the basis of geography, thus providing excellent opportunity for
geographical sampling. The baseline wave of CFAS II had a lower
response rate, and in the publication of our prevalence estimates
strenuous efforts were made to rule out the possibility that this
drove the reduction in prevalence that we observed. The 2 year
follow-up had a 74% response rate, almost identical to CFAS I,
and the analytical methods address the initial non-response as
well as the longitudinal dropout due to refusal in those alive.
Other studies have found that incidence is not as affected as
prevalence by non-response23 and our results did not alter after
initial non-response adjustment. The death rate in CFAS I
was higher than that seen in CFAS II and hence more individuals
are included within the CFAS II analysis despite no change in the
longitudinal response rate over time. The baseline interview
moved from a two stage design to one stage, and for the 2 year
follow-up there were some additions of new measures in the
interviews but the CFAS I interviews were represented in CFAS II
interviews. CFAS I estimates are less precise due to the earlier two
phase design reducing power than CFAS II where all participants
received the full screen and assessment content. The interviews
were on the basis of standardized methods, which has advantages
and disadvantages. The major advantage here is the stability of
the interview method and diagnostic approach for study dementia
status allocation. In the intervening years the diagnostic criteria
have changed many times, with current particular instability
due to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM)
and
International
classification
of
diseases
(ICD)
refreshment and the increasing popularity of the concept of
predementia states24. These changes are influencing the way that
societies view dementia, risk prediction for dementia and
interaction with services. However, the purpose here was to see
whether the fundamental stable phenomenon is changing, rather
than measuring increases which are likely to be the result of
shifting diagnostic boundaries. To test the impact of these societal
changes we need to use current extensive phenotyping within the
context of such stable methods, and then understand the
implications of changing diagnostic boundaries for prediction
and
prognostication.

 from death certificates to estimate individuals who develop
dementia then die quickly between the waves. Our findings show
a larger decrease in men than women between the two time
periods, but from incidence rates in CFAS I where the rates in
women were (up until the oldest old) lower than seen in men. The
results of regression to the mean can therefore not be excluded,
however, this is potentially unlikely due to the small but
consistent decrease seen also in women and due to the large
study size and random population sampling.
The new analysis methods give very similar results to the
original method for CFAS I. In that investigation England and
Wales (MRC CFAS, 5 areas) were estimated to have 163,000
individuals newly meeting dementia criteria each year in 1991
(ref. 25), re-analysis based only on the three CFAS I areas
included here is 164,000, and the contemporary analysis for CFAS
II applied to current UK population age sex distribution is
170,000, only a 6,000 increase.
Our findings suggest that population brain health is changing,
possibly fundamentally, across generations and is likely to be
adversely affected by risk factors associated with disadvantage.
The positive change seen in Europe may be limited to those
countries that have had major investments into population health
over the lifecourse of those now in older ages. Such investment
has not been experienced across the globe, and the lack of
progress in access to education, current patterns of malnutrition
in childhood and persistent inequalities within and across
countries will play out across the lifecourse of our children and
young adults. Within the UK and Europe the reductions we
report will be offset within services by the concept of ‘‘early’’
detection, and diagnosis which is driven by a combination of
policy initiatives focused on increasing national diagnosis rates26,
and
diagnostic
boundary
shifts
meaning
that
individuals
who
were
previously
not
diagnosed
with
dementia
or
cognitive impairment are now being tested and referred for
specialist assessment with identification of ever milder stages
with unknown prognostic significance. Only studies with stable
diagnostic methods are able to tease out these secular diagnostic
trends from true underlying biological changes.
Incidence rates have indeed declined over the last two decades
in these areas, mainly in men with women’s rates decreasing
less strongly. These provide definitive confirmation of the
earlier reports from CFAS II of reduction in prevalence. The
finding is consistent across areas. This provides the evidence
required using stable diagnostic methods that dementia has gone
down within England over the last 20 years.
CFAS II is the first multi-area study globally to have been
designed and powered from its outset to compare prevalence
and incidence, and test using as identical methods as possible,
new independent sampling and steady diagnostic method.
The findings now add more robust data to those European
studies, which reported on incidence from single sites using
indirect measurement. It is also consistent with cohort changes in
cognitive profiles upwards19,20.
It has been long recognized that primary prevention of
dementia as opposed to secondary (early detection) or tertiary
(mitigation once present) through healthier lifecourse at societal
levels, reduced vascular risk and enhanced opportunity for all
types of engagement is likely to be more cost effective than
national initiatives, such as dementia strategies targeted at
earlier and earlier identification of at-risk states27, although
all approaches should be fully explored for their potential.
Our findings support a balancing towards a lifecourse emphasis,
although clearly there will always be a need for therapies to
target specific disorders or well defined risk groups, and for
appropriate care for those whose dementia is in the context of
comorbidity and frailty, close to the end of life.
Influential reports in the media and for government continue
to promote future scenarios of huge increases of people with
dementia in global societies. Undoubtedly this is correct for some
areas of the globe. But our study confirms the finding of reduction
of not only age-specific prevalence but also incidence in the UK.
This provides definitive evidence that dementia in whole
populations is changing. Our studies were powered to detect this
change and the finding is consistent across the three areas. Policy
makers and politicians will need to take into account the now
compelling evidence that such changes in the onset and
occurrence of dementia are possible. The underlying aetiology
may also be changing. Global attention to health across the
lifecourse, particularly earlier risk evolution before older age, may
be particularly important and remains relatively neglected in
societies’ search for specific therapies, when in fact, the dementia
‘‘tsunami’’ is in the oldest age groups and characterized by greater
complexity than allowed for in current disease models28.

 Methods
CFAS I: Between 1989 and 1994 baseline screening interviews in complete
population samples of people aged 65 years and over, followed by an assessment
interview in 20%, were conducted in five geographical areas of the UK, with a
2 year follow-up (incidence phase). Three of the areas were selected on the basis of
representing the range of prevalence estimates (not significantly different between
the areas) observed across the areas and to provide rural/urban and north/south
areas. These were Cambridgeshire, Newcastle and Nottingham (baseline interviews
for these three areas 1991–3).
CFAS I and CFAS II had identical designs, methods and diagnostic approach
apart from the simplification of design from two stage to one stage at baseline and
incidence phase through combination of screen and assessment interviews, though
the CFAS I interview was completely included in CFAS II. Both studies used the
UK system of primary care registration, which provides the most robust population
sampling frame (including institutions) and allows true geographical sampling held
steady over time. Sampling was stratified according to age group (under 75 and 75
and over) to allow sufficient numbers in the older age group. Oversampling
from the population register was used to allow for losses (death, incorrect
registration, ineligibility and GP refusals, participant or gatekeeper refusal).
The primary care practices screened records of patients in selected practices for
death and terminal illness29.
Fully informed written consent was sought, and when capacity was impaired
procedures complied with the UK Mental Capacity Act 2005. CFAS has been
approved locally at all centres since its beginning in 1989. After the introduction
of multicentre research ethics committees, the study continued to apply for both
multicentre and local research ethics committee approval at each centre. Full
information on the changes that have occurred over the previous 25years to the title
changes of local research ethics and multicentre ethical committees, along with REC
numbers can be found here http://www.cfas.ac.uk/cfas-i/data/#cfasi-ethical-approval.
CFAS I and II approach. An introductory letter from the general practitioner was
followed by a visit from a named study interviewer. Fully informed written consent
was sought and when capacity was impaired procedures complied with the UK
Mental Capacity Act 2005. At 2 year follow-up all those respondents who had
provided an interview and were still alive were re-approached, having first checked
with the general practice for terminal illness or other contra-indication to
re-approach. Each individual was visited up to three times to maximize response
at each time period.
For both CFAS I and II local interviewers were recruited from a range of
backgrounds. Some of the interviewers from CFAS I in each area continued to
CFAS II across all time points, others were newly recruited. They were provided
with identical training by the senior study coordinator who also had continuity
from CFAS I. The training consisted of an intensive 1 week course with ongoing
practice and training at individual study sites until the interviewer reached a
consistent and standardized level.
The CFAS I screening interview included questions on sociodemographic
variables, lifestyle, health, activities of daily living (basic and instrumental), cognition,
health and social care contact and medication. A sample of 20% was invited for a
standardised assessment interview, which included the full Geriatric Mental State
examination, containing sufficient information for ascertainment of the dementia
syndrome and other neuropsychiatric syndromes in older populations. This
provided the background information for the diagnostic algorithm, AGECAT30,31.
For all these interviews an informant interview was also requested. The sample for
assessment was a stratified random sample on the basis of Mini Mental State
Examination (MMSE) score32, AGECAT organicity score and age, with higher
selection probabilities at lower cognitive ability. The subset included in the
assessment interview were biased towards the cognitively frail (all suspected of
having dementia, or who had an MMSE r21), together with 1 in 2 to 1 in 10
individuals who were not suspected of having dementia and had MMSE scores above
21. At 2 years in CFAS I those who had not been selected for assessment interview
were invited to an incidence screen, with a further 20% invited to assessment (again
enhanced for the cognitive impaired). All those who had had assessment at baseline
and were willing to be followed up had a combined screen and assessment interview.
In CFAS II this combined screen assessment interview (identical to the two
interviews above) was used from the outset, simplifying the design. Overall 20% of
respondents were asked to identify an informant—weighted sampling towards the
cognitively frail, but also to provide representation of the whole population.
This was repeated for the 2 year follow-up.
CFAS I baseline wave was undertaken between 1991–1993 with the incidence
wave during 1993–1995. CFAS II was undertaken during 2008–2011 for the
baseline wave and 2011–2013 for the incidence wave (see Fig. 1).
The algorithmic approach to diagnosis allows stability over time, without the
variability likely to be present whenever those subject to the changes in diagnostic
practices over time are involved in diagnosis (whether it be individual clinician or
consensus). The GMS-AGECAT has been validated against internationally
accepted earlier diagnostic criteria (DSM-IIIR)33. Missing data within an interview
could prevent an algorithm diagnosis and for individuals with missing data, the
same approach was taken for CFAS II as for CFAS I, which was a review of all
available information by diagnostician (CB), applying DSM-IIIR criteria. Many of
these individuals had severe cognitive impairment and were not able to respond to
the interview questions.
Area deprivation tertiles were calculated on the basis of the Townsend
deprivation index in 1991 for CFAS I and 2007 (latest available) in CFAS II.
Postcodes are used to calculate deprivation for the complete eligible sample
(therefore reflecting any non-response deprivation effect).
Analytical methods. Modelling of dementia incidence has been undertaken using
the same methods for both CFAS I and II studies. Investigation of incidence in
CFAS II is more straightforward as all individuals were included in the dementia
diagnosis if they took part in the interviews (see Fig. 1). In CFAS I a stratified
subset of individuals (representing the complete age and cognitive spectrum) at
each wave undertook the assessment interviews, so this process needs to be
modelled for those missing dementia diagnosis by design.
Full likelihood modelling25,34 of dementia incidence was undertaken as part of a
multiple imputation for non-response using WinBUGS 1.4.3 (ref. 35) and STATA 12
(ref. 36). The full likelihood model used for the living individuals has been presented
and discussed further in Clayton et al. (ref. 34) and Matthews (ref. 37). It has shown
to have sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 95% to real and simulated data. Further
extensions of the missing data model were shown to not improve the prediction of
the missing data37. Individuals who took part in the first wave interview and were
still alive at the 2 year follow-up were modelled for dementia prevalence, incidence
and the relationship between MMSE (the screening instrument) and dementia status,
together with a missing data model for longitudinal loss to follow-up. The model is
composed of three parts, prevalence, incidence and missing data. Missing data and
screening models included adjustment for deprivation, gender, age and residential
setting. Longitudinal missing data additionally included information on dementia
and MMSE from the previous wave, together with adjustment for known attrition
factors38,39. Full likelihood models for imputing dementia status at wave 1 and wave
2 consist of four parts of the model:
1. Prevalence of dementia at wave 1—dementia potentially related to age and sex.
2. Incidence of dementia at wave 2—incidence potentially related to age and sex in
those who were not demented at wave 1.
3. Relationship
between
MMSE,
missing
MMSE
and
dementia
(essential
component of CFAS I design)—model includes age, sex, deprivation, care
settings, area (study site) and dementia status.
4. Longitudinal missing data—longitudinal missing data is related to age, sex, care
status, area (study site), deprivation, disability, dementia at wave 1, MMSE at
wave 1 and factors associated with attrition.
Factors associated with attrition were combined from smoking history,
education, social class, disability, self-reported health, memory problems and
proxy/short interviews using factor analysis to ensure that all were present or
absent to reduce the missing data models required during the modelling process.
Three unique factors were found in each study.
The model can provide a dementia incidence rate, however initial non-response
is not included within the model and hence a two stage process was employed.
All individuals with missing data received an imputed dementia diagnosis from
the full likelihood models at wave 1 and wave 2 and person years were also imputed
for each individual where a follow-up interview was not undertaken. Individuals
with incident dementia at wave 2 (both known and imputed) were assumed to have
developed their dementia mid way between the two waves. A total of 100 imputed
datasets were calculated. In addition, person time of observation was imputed for
those missing wave 2 completely. Individuals with dementia at wave 2 (or imputed
dementia at wave 2) were assumed to have developed the dementia mid way
between the study waves. Incidence was calculated in all those who were observed
(or imputed) to be dementia free at wave 1. Within each imputed dataset, the
incidence rate by 1,000 person years was calculated in a weighted Poisson
regression model adjusting for initial non-response, using previously calculated
initial non-response weights11 in those individuals who were either known or
imputed to be without dementia at baseline.
All full likelihood models were undertaken in WinBUGS using non-informative
uniform priors or flat normal priors for all parameters35. The only difference in the
models between the studies was that in CFAS I the study design of dementia being
missing by design is additionally modelled at each wave34. Convergence was
checked using Gelman Rubin40. Autocorrelation within the models was removed
by update thinning. All models were fitted with 1,000 burn in samples, with
thinning of 10, with a further 1,000 to produce an incidence rate within the studies
(not adjusted by non-response). Overall 100 imputation datasets (thinned by 10)
were then created to undertake the analysis adjusted for initial non-response. All
estimates were calculated separately in each imputation dataset and combined with
Rubin’s rules41, with 95% CI estimates. Mean estimates are used throughout
though medians were compared and found similar. Inverse probability weighted
Poisson regression was used to calculate incidence of dementia by age and sex in
each study in each imputed dataset. Incidence rates are presented per 1,000 person
years. The effect of area, deprivation, age and sex were investigated univariately and
then multivariately in the Poisson regression models (see Supplementary Table 3
for deprivation). Robustness of the conclusions to model assumptions were tested
by also using Negative Binomial regression models, but the results were unchanged.
Significance values of findings were taken from the regression models.
Changes in incidence over time were investigated using the imputation samples
and estimating a study effect after adjustment for age, area (as study site),

 deprivation and sex differences between the studies. Area (and deprivation)
differences in incidence rates for each study were investigated after adjusting for
age and sex effects. Modelled incidence rates are presented per 1,000 person years
by age and sex. These estimates are provided (adjusted for multiple imputation) as
an IRR (and 95% CI). Total numbers of incidence cases occurring in England and
also the UK are calculated using population estimates by age (1991 and 2011 census
population data and 2015 current population estimates). The effect of area,
deprivation, age and sex were investigated univariately and then multivariately in
the Poisson regression models (see Supplementary Table 3 for deprivation). Area
(study site) effects are presented as an IRR with Cambridgeshire as the referent,
deprivation as an IRR with lowest deprivation tertile as the referent, deprivation
trends across tertiles were also estimated. The estimate of change over time was
calculated adjusting for age, sex, deprivation and area differences. Change is
presented as an IRR using CFAS I as the reference, and a 95% CI. The study effect
was also estimated within a combined full likelihood model with study included at
each step of the process mentioned above. The results were consistent with the
weighted estimates.
A number of sensitivity models were run to check on the impact of the missing
data on the model estimates. Including further parameters within any parts of the
model did not modify the dementia incidence rates seen. Modelling the missing
data as missing at random within the above detailed steps was appropriate to the
study data. Modifying the missing data models to include or exclude the various
prediction parameters (care, adjustments, deprivation etc) had little impact on the
models hence the model considered a priori is presented. Sensitivity to adjustment
for attrition was undertaken splitting out the adjustment factors, but the incidence
rates were robust to these changes, hence the model with fewer attrition parameters
is presented.
Three additional sensitivity analyses were undertaken to show that the missing
data model did not determine the results. In CFAS II it is possible to undertake a
simple attrition and non-response weighted Poisson regression analysis due to the
measurement of dementia at both times. In CFAS I the method used in the original
CFAS I incidence estimation25 was also undertaken, though this method has
been shown to be less efficient than the full likelihood method described above37.
In addition, the small subset of individuals who had direct incidence estimates were
also used for comparison. All three methods are compared in Supplementary
Table 3, and were found comparable.
Comparison with previous results. Supplementary Table 1 shows a comparison
of the presented results in survivors compared to other methods of analysis.
The rates in CFAS I are compared with the analysis method used in the original
incidence paper for CFAS I (ref. 25), which has been shown to be less efficient that
the method developed after that publication37. There is some fluctuation in the
results as expected due to the size of the samples but the results are consistent
between the two, and as expected the new method has narrower CIs. An additional
analysis using only those with directly measured incidence (and weighted back to
the original sample) is also shown for comparison, with similar (at older ages) but
very unstable estimates. The second comparison takes the full likelihood Bayesian
model and imputation and compares with the usual method of analysis for
incidence of a weighted Poisson regression analysis possible in CFAS II, the results
are completely consistent.
