abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Preterm birth relates to long-term alterations in cardiac 
morphology and function. Understanding whether preterm postnatal life is a tractable 
period of cardiovascular development that can be positively altered by nutrition is relevant 
to long-term outcomes. We hypothesized that being fed human breast milk during early 
postnatal life is beneficial to long-term cardiac structure and function in preterm-born 
individuals compared with infant formulas.
METHODS: A total of 926 preterm-born infants originally took part in a randomized controlled 
trial of postnatal milk-feeding regimens between 1982 and 1985 across 5 different UK 
centers. Preterm-born individuals were randomly assigned to either breast milk donated 
by unrelated lactating women or nutrient-enriched formulas. We followed 102 individuals 
from this cohort: 30 of whom had been randomized to being fed exclusively human milk 
and 16 to being fed exclusively formula. As a comparison group, we recruited an additional 
102 individuals born term to uncomplicated pregnancies. Cardiac morphology and function 
were assessed by MRI.
RESULTS: Preterm-born individuals fed exclusively human milk as infants had increased left 
and right ventricular end-diastolic volume index (+9.73%, P = .04 and +18.2%, P < .001) and 
stroke volume index (+9.79%, P = .05 and +22.1%, P = .01) compared with preterm-born 
individuals who were exclusively formula fed as infants.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence of a beneficial association between 
breast milk and cardiac morphology and function in adult life in those born preterm and 
supports promotion of human milk for the care of preterm infants to reduce long-term 
cardiovascular risk.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Preterm-born 
young adults exhibit an adverse cardiac morphology 
and function. The preterm postnatal period is a key 
developmental window during which cardiac changes 
emerge, although it is not known whether postnatal 
nutrition is relevant to long-term cardiac structure and 
function.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This study provides the fi
 rst 
evidence of a benefi
 cial association between postnatal 
breast milk consumption and cardiac morphology in 
adulthood in preterm-born individuals. These fi
 ndings 
support promotion of human milk for preterm infant 
care to reduce long-term cardiovascular risk.

Increased survival of preterm infants 
has resulted in growing numbers 
now reaching adulthood. Recently 
we demonstrated these young adults 
exhibit a unique, adverse cardiac 
morphology and function, with 
reduced ventricular volumes and 
function and disproportionately 
increased mass.1, 
2 Experimental 
models implicate the early postnatal 
period as a key developmental 
window during which cardiac 
changes emerge. Preterm birth 
and the subsequent ex utero 
environment result in abnormal 
myocardial maturation, hypertrophy, 
and fibrosis.3, 
4 We therefore 
hypothesized different nutritional 
exposures during this period might 
modify preterm cardiac development. 
In particular, human milk feeding 
has been shown to preferentially 
influence the cardiovascular 
phenotype, which may in part relate 
to bioactive factors in breast milk.5–7 
Therefore, we reanalyzed our data 
on cardiac morphology and function 
to take into account exposure to 
different milk feeding regimens.
METHODS
Participants
The study participants were 
recruited from a cohort of 926 
preterm-born infants who 
participated in a randomized 
controlled trial, initially investigating 
the effects of early diet on later 
cognitive function (Fig 1). Details 
of the trial have been published 
comprehensively elsewhere, 
8 but 
briefly, infants born between 1982 
and 1985 with no major congenital 
anomalies and of birth weight 
<1850 g were recruited in 5 UK 
centers. They were randomly 
assigned to either breast milk 
donated by unrelated lactating 
women, nutrient-enriched preterm 
formula (Farley’s Osterprem), or 
standard term formula (Farley’s 
Ostermilk; Farley's Health Products, 
Plymouth, UK). Within each trial, the 
diets were randomly assigned in 
2 strata: the trial diets alone (A) and, 
in mothers who elected to express 
their own milk, the trial diets were 
assigned as supplements to mother’s 
milk (B; Fig 1). The composition of 
the assigned diets has previously 
been described.8, 
9 Follow-up studies 
were designed to test the hypothesis 
that early diet influences risk factors 
for cardiovascular disease.10
A total of 102 of these subjects, aged 
between 23 and 28 years, were 
able to attend an appointment in 
Oxford for detailed cardiovascular 
phenotyping, including cardiac MRI 
(Fig 1).1, 
2 Of these, 30 individuals 
had been randomized to exclusively 
human milk (EHM) in the initial 
feeding trial, whereas the remaining 
62 were randomized to either 
term formula or preterm formula. 
As we wished to study only those 
individuals who received the 
assigned milk as sole diet, 16 of the 
62 were included as being exclusively 
fed formula (EFF). We recruited 
102 young adults born term to 
uncomplicated pregnancies with age 
and sex distributions similar to those 
of the preterm-born young adults via 
advertisement to undergo identical 
investigations. All data were coded 
with subject- and study-specific IDs 
to ensure anonymity and blinded 
analysis. The follow-up study was 
registered with ClinicalTrials.gov 
(NCT01487824) and the protocol and 
recruitment strategy have previously 
been reported.1, 
2, 
11–13 The study 
was approved by the relevant ethics 
committee (Oxfordshire Research 
Ethics Committee A: 06/Q1604/118) 
and all participants provided signed 
informed consent.
Follow-up Visit in Young Adulthood
Anthropometry, Blood Pressure, Blood 
Samples, and Lifestyle Questionnaire

Cardiovascular Clinical Research 
Facility in the morning after 
a 12-hour overnight fast. 
Anthropometric data, blood pressure 
measures, and blood sample 
collection were done as previously 
described.1,

11–13 Data on medical 
history, smoking, parental medical 
history, and lifestyle were obtained 
by using a validated questionnaire.14

Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance
Cardiovascular magnetic resonance 
was performed on a 1.5-T Siemens 
Sonata scanner (Siemens Healthcare, 
Erlangen, Germany).1, 
2 Steady-state 
free precession cine sequences 
were used to acquire localization 
images followed by optimized left 
ventricular horizontal and vertical 
long-axis cines. From these, a left 
ventricular short-axis cine stack was 
obtained with standardized basal 
slice alignment with a 7-mm slice 
thickness and 3-mm interslice gap. 
The cine images were stored on a 
digital archive for postprocessing, 
which was undertaken as detailed 
later in this article. We also acquired 
ShMOLLI T1 maps by using 
previously described methods15 
and assessed thoracic dimensions 
and pulmonary artery diameters16 
by using our localizer images (see 
Supplemental Information).
Quantifi
 cation of Cardiac Geometry 
and Mass
Image analysis for right and left 
ventricular volumes, mass, and 
dimensions was performed offline 
by using Argus (Siemens Healthcare, 
Erlangen, Germany) as previously 
described.1, 
2 Briefly, left and right 
ventricular short-axis epicardial 
and endocardial borders were 
manually contoured for each slice 
at end-diastole and endocardial 
borders at end-systole to allow 
automated calculation of right and 
left ventricular mass and volumes, 
indexed to body surface area. Left 
ventricular internal cavity diameters 
were measured on the mid-
ventricular short-axis slice at end-
diastole while left ventricular lengths 
and right ventricular diameters were 
measured on the horizontal long-axis 
cines.
Assessment of Left Ventricular 
Geometry
We have previously created left 
ventricular statistical meshes for this 
population by using novel, in-house 
methods17, 
18 that have been made 
available to the scientific community 
at amdb.isd.kcl.ac.uk.19 Principal 
component analysis was undertaken 
to identify the key modes of variation 
of the shape between groups.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was carried 
out by using SPSS Version 22 (IBM 
SPSS Statistics, IBM Corporation, 
Chicago, IL). Normality of variables 
was assessed by visual assessment 
of normality curves and Shapiro-
Wilk test. Comparison between 
groups for continuous variables 
was performed by using a 2-sided, 
independent-samples Student’s 
t test. For categorical variables, 
comparison was done by using a 
χ2 test. Pearson correlations (r) 
were used for bivariate associations 
and unstandardized regression 
coefficients (B) were used for 
bivariable and multivariable 
linear regression models. Results 
are presented as mean ± SD. 
P values were adjusted by using the 
Bonferroni method by multiplying 
the respective unadjusted P values 
by 3 (the number of pairwise 
comparisons when there are 3 
groups) where multiple comparisons 
were performed between groups. 
Comparisons between groups were 
also adjusted for age and sex. P < 
.05 was considered statistically 
significant.
RESULTS
Characteristics of Cohorts
There were no significant differences 
between preterm-born young adults 
who had been fed EHM as infants 
compared with those exclusively 
fed EFF in perinatal characteristics 
(Supplemental Table 3) or 
anthropometrics, demographics, 
blood biochemistry, or blood 
pressure in young adulthood (Table 
1). However, both groups had altered 
blood biochemistry profiles and 
increased blood pressures compared 
with young adults born term. There 
were no significant differences in 
number of smokers, personal and 
family medical history, or lifestyle 
factors, such as socioeconomic 
status, physical activity, or diet 
(P > .05) between the 2 milk-feeding 
preterm groups, nor were there 
any differences between these 
groups compared with the control 
groups of adults born at term to 
uncomplicated pregnancies (Table 1 
and Supplemental Table 4).
Left Ventricular Size and Function
Preterm-born individuals fed 
EHM as infants have an increased 
mean left ventricular end-diastolic 
volume index (+9.73%; 73.3 ± 7.6 
vs 66.8 ± 6.7 mL/m2, P = .04) and 
left ventricular stroke volume index 
(+9.79%; 47.1 ± 5.9 vs 42.9 ± 6.3 
mL/m2, P = .05) compared with 
preterm-born individuals who were 
fed EFF as infants (Fig 2 and Table 2). 
Although both feeding groups still 
had significantly smaller left 
ventricular end-diastolic volume 
index and stroke volume index than 
adults born term, the reduction in 
the group fed EHM was only ∼9% 
compared with 18% in the group 
fed EFF for both left ventricular end-
diastolic volume index and stroke 
volume index. Both preterm-born 
groups had similar left ventricular 
mass index and ejection fraction 
(P > .99), although the preterm group 
fed EFF had significantly shorter left 
ventricles (P = .05) with reduced left 
ventricular luminal diameters (P = 
.009). The range of values for the left 
ventricular parameters in the term-
born controls is similar to normal 
ranges previously published by using 
cardiovascular magnetic resonance.20
Left Ventricular Shape and Native T1 
Imaging
Shape analysis confirmed the 
differences in size observed by 
using standard metrics (Fig 3), 
which particularly highlighted 
the significant increase in left 
ventricular length (P < .001) in

LEWANDOWSKI et al 
the EHM group compared with 
the preterm individuals fed EFF. 
Importantly, there were no other 
major geometric variations identified 
between preterm-born individuals 
fed EHM and those fed EFF (Fig 3) 
or term-born adults. We did not 
observe significant differences in 
myocardial tissue characterization 
by T1 mapping. Preterm-born young 
adults fed EFF had similar native T1 
values to those fed EHM (961.0 ± 
43.1 vs 959.0 ± 27.3 ms, P > .99), and 
term-born young adults (969.1 ± 24.7 
ms, P = .26 and P = .51, respectively), 
in range of the normal population 
values.15
Right Ventricular Size and Function
Interestingly, the percentage 
differences between preterm-born 
young adults who had been fed EHM 
as infants compared with those fed 
EFF were much greater for right 
ventricular end-diastolic volume 
index (+18.2%, P < .001) and right 
ventricular stroke volume index 
(+22.1%, P = .01). Furthermore, 
although there was only a 5.42% 
reduction in right ventricular end-
diastolic volume index and 8.13% 
in right ventricular stroke volume 
index in preterm-born young adults 
fed EHM compared with term-
born controls, preterm-born young 
adults fed EFF showed substantially 
greater reductions in these cardiac 
parameters when compared with 
term-born controls (25.0% and 
24.8%, respectively).
Right ventricular mass index 
and length were similar between 
preterm groups (Table 2). However, 
preterm-born young adults fed 
EHM had similar right ventricular 
ejection fractions as term-born 
young adults (P = .31), whereas 
preterm-born young adults fed EFF 
showed reduced right ventricular 
ejection fractions compared with 
term-born controls (P < .001). 
The range of values for the right 
ventricular parameters in the term-
born controls is similar to normal 
ranges previously published by using 
cardiovascular magnetic resonance.20
Predictors of Cardiac Changes
We have previously demonstrated 
that gestational age is the strongest 
predictor of left and right ventricular 
end-diastolic volumes and stroke 
volumes.1, 
2 To test whether being 
fed EHM was also an independent 
predictor of these cardiac parameters 
in preterm-born individuals, we 
created separate multivariable 
regression models for each of our 4 
major cardiac changes and included 
those fed EFF or EHM postnatally. 
In multivariable models including 
gestational age, sex, postnatal milk-
feeding group, and postnatal weight 
gain, gestational age remained 
an independent predictor for all 
4 cardiac measures (P < .001); 
however, being fed EHM was also 
an independent predictor of left

ventricular end-diastolic volume

stroke volume index (P = .03), 
right ventricular end-diastolic 
volume index (P = .002), and right 
ventricular stroke volume index 
(P = .004). In line with the changes 
between preterm feeding groups 
being greater for the right ventricle, 
in a multivariable regression model 
across the entire preterm group 
(n = 102) with gestational age, sex, 
percentage of human milk in the 
diet, and postnatal weight gain as 
the predictors, the percentage of 
human milk was positively related to 
both right ventricular end-diastolic 
volume index (P = .009) and stroke 
volume index (P = .04), but not left 
ventricular parameters. There were 
no correlations between percentage 
of expressed milk and cardiac 
measures within the group fed 
EHM.
Thoracic Cavity Size and Pulmonary 
Artery Diameters
Preterm-born young adults fed 
EFF had reduced thoracic cavity 
dimensions compared with those 
fed EHM (Supplemental Table 5). 
Although there were no differences 
between preterm-born young 
adults fed EFF versus EHM in 
aortic diameters (2.35 ± 0.30 
vs 2.42 ± 0.22 cm, P = .36), those in 
the EFF group had increased main 
pulmonary artery diameters 
(2.41 ± 0.21 vs 2.16 ± 0.23 cm, 
P = .002) and pulmonary artery to 
aortic diameter ratios (1.04 ± 0.12 
vs 0.89 ± 0.07, P < .001). 
Furthermore, pulmonary artery to 
aortic diameter ratios were inversely 
related to right ventricular end-
diastolic volume index and stroke 
volume index (r = –0.41, P = .005 and 
r = –0.40, P = .007, respectively) but 
not left ventricular parameters.

DISCUSSION
We provide the first evidence of an 
association between early postnatal 
nutrition in preterm-born infants 
and cardiac structure and function in 
later life. Left and right ventricular 
end-diastolic and stroke volumes in 
the EHM group approached values 
seen in term-born controls with 
particularly striking findings for the 
right ventricle.
Breast milk contains a greater 
bioactivity and bioavailability of a 
number of growth factors, enzymes, 
and antibodies compared with even 
the best infant formulas.21, 
22 
These factors are relevant to 
normal growth and development, 
as well as improving preterm 
infant health. Although the content 
of preterm formulas in particular 
has been modified to better meet 
the needs of the growing preterm 
infant since the 1980s, such as the 
inclusion of polyunsaturated fatty 
acids, 
23 the American Academy of 
Pediatrics continues to recommend 
that preterm infants be given 
pasteurized donor milk rather 
than preterm formula if a mother 
is unable to provide adequate 
breast milk volume.24 The benefits 
of human breast milk have also 
been demonstrated to extend to 
other parts of the cardiovascular 
system. Human milk intake in 
preterm infants shows a beneficial 
association with proximal cerebral 
arterial vessel tortuosity: a marker 
of cerebrovascular development 
that is reduced in preterm infants.5 
Breast milk may act through similar 
pathways to protect vascular and 
cardiac development as it contains 
essential growth factors, such as 
vascular endothelial growth factor, 
which are of particular benefit to 
early stages of vasculogenesis and 
angiogenesis in preterm infants.25 
Altered vasculogenesis and 
angiogenesis in preterm individuals 
has been shown as early as fetal life 
and extends into adulthood, 
13, 
26 
and is an important contributor 
to poor lung development in 
preterm infants, as it plays a pivotal 
role in alveolarization.27 It is 
therefore possible that, due to the 
interdependence of the lungs and 
the right ventricle, the reason we see 
greater benefits in right ventricular 
volumes and function in preterm-
born young adults who were fed 
EHM postnatally as compared with 
the left ventricle is due to essential 
vascular growth factors contained in 
breast milk that benefit lung function 
and development.28 Although we 
did not collect lung function data in 
this cohort, the slight reduction in 
thoracic cavity dimensions and the 
increase in pulmonary artery size 
in the group fed EFF supports this 
notion, as does the close relationship 
between pulmonary artery 
dimensions and right ventricular 
morphology. The data suggest that 
breast milk may reduce the risk of 
pulmonary arterial hypertension and 
future cardiopulmonary disease in 
preterm-born individuals.16
As our study participants were 
still relatively young, continued 
follow-up will be necessary to assess 
clinical outcome as they reach later 
adulthood. Data on the relevance of 
cardiac morphology and function 
to disease development are sparse 
in young populations. Nevertheless, 
reductions in end-diastolic volume 
and stroke volume, which were much 
greater in the group fed EFF, lead 
to proportional changes in maximal 
exercise capacity29: an independent 
predictor of cardiovascular morbidity 
and mortality.30, 
31 Furthermore, 
the reductions in right ventricular 
systolic function in the group fed 
EFF are of independent and additive 
prognostic value in chronic heart 
failure and are powerful predictors 
of mortality in left heart failure, 
32 and 
may therefore directly contribute 
to the onset of clinical heart 
failure.33 We have not performed 
late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) 
imaging in this cohort to assess for 
scar burden. However, native T1 
values were within the normal 
range, 
15 with no statistical differences 
between the groups studied. Given 
the lack of significantly elevated 
T1 values typically seen in areas 
of infarction34, 
35 and the lack of 
regional wall motion abnormalities, 
it is unlikely that large areas of focal 
scarring are missed; although small 
areas of scarring cannot be ruled 
out with absolute certainty, this is 
unlikely to alter the main message of 
the article.
Use of our computational atlas 
allowed us to confirm that cardiac 
differences between groups were 
proportional size changes, rather 
than alterations in geometric 
dimensions. These findings suggest 
the changes in cardiac morphology 
observed in preterm-born individuals 
relate primarily to size rather than 
geometric alterations, and that 
breast milk leads to proportional 
normalization of size. Interestingly, 
fetal growth–restricted offspring, 
who have more spherical hearts in 
fetal and postnatal life, also showed 
benefits of human breast milk, with 
longer breastfeeding durations 
relating to normalization of left 
ventricular sphericity.7 Although 
breast milk appears to have differing 
effects in these offspring, the findings 
support the necessity of breast milk as 
part of early nutrition for individuals 
born to pregnancy complications 
as a protective mechanism to 
cardiovascular development.
Our finding that gestational age 
remained a significant, independent 
predictor of cardiac parameters when 
milk-feeding diets were taken into 
account is in line with our previous 
results.1, 
2 Although our data suggest 
that it is not possible to reverse 
all cardiac changes related to the 
degree of prematurity through breast 
milk feeding, the magnitude of the 
differences between preterm-born 
adults fed EHM and those fed EFF is 
substantial and occurs independent 
of gestational age. Our finding that 
percentage of human milk consumed 
7

LEWANDOWSKI et al 
was positively associated with right 
ventricular morphology and function 
suggests that even small amounts of 
human milk in the preterm postnatal 
diet may be beneficial. Understanding 
the benefits and optimum duration 
of breast milk feeding on cardiac 
remodeling across a large range of 
gestational ages of preterm-born 
individuals will be of benefit to better 
understand feeding approaches for 
different gestational age categories of 
preterm birth.
Despite the magnitude of the cardiac 
differences between milk-feeding 
groups, this study does not prove 
causality. First, the number of 
participants available for comparison 
is relatively small compared with 
the size of the original cohort. 
Due to loss of follow-up and the 
long-term prospective nature of 
our study, the study was not fully 
randomized, and as such, there is risk 
of ascertainment bias. It is therefore 
possible that other associated 
factors in the perinatal period 
account for a proportion of the 
differences we have identified, such 
as genetic risk, epigenetic changes, 
and environmental factors.36, 
37 
However, our preterm groups were 
similar in baseline demographics 
and demographic characteristics 
in young adulthood. Furthermore, 
unlike other studies that often rely 
on questionnaires and recall, 
7 we can 
be certain of the exact dietary intake 
of our preterm-born individuals 
during early postnatal life. It is 
possible that mothers who elect to 
breastfeed may be fundamentally 
different from mothers who do not. 
However, we found no evidence of 
this in our group fed EHM, suggesting 
that donor milk provides a similar 
level of benefit as the expressed 
breast milk from their mothers. The 
randomized preterm population 
was previously followed up at age 
13 to 16 years, 
6 and in that study 
breast milk consumption had a 
beneficial impact on blood pressure 
in adolescents born preterm 
resulting in a 4-mm Hg lower mean 
arterial pressure. Our group was 
smaller and, as a result, our analysis 
was not powered to identify this 
size of difference in blood pressure, 
although was still able to identify 
the proportionally larger variation 
in cardiac morphology associated 
with breast milk consumption. 
Interestingly, the similar blood 
pressures and metabolic profiles 
between groups does support the 
concept that the differences between 
EHM and EFF preterm-born young 
adults occur independently of other 
cardiovascular risk factors. Longer-
term follow-up will be required to 
understand the true impact of this 
variation on cardiovascular risk.
CONCLUSIONS
We provide the first evidence of 
a beneficial association between 
breast milk and cardiac morphology 
in adult life in those born preterm. 
The findings implicate early preterm 
postnatal life as a potentially 
tractable period of cardiovascular 
development, relevant to long-term 
outcomes, and support promotion 
of human milk for the care of 
preterm infants to reduce long-term 
cardiovascular risk.
