ABSTRACT 
Pemetrexed (PMX) is a key drug for the management of malignant pleural 
mesothelioma (MPM). However, its therapeutic efficacy is cruelly restricted in many 
clinical settings by the over-expression of thymidylate synthase (TS) gene. Recently, we 
emphasized the efficacy of locally administered shRNA designed against TS gene in 
enhancing the cytotoxic effect of PMX against orthotopically implanted MPM cells in 
tumor xenograft tumor model. Herein, we explored the efficiency of systemic, rather 
than local, delivery of TS RNAi molecule in sensitizing MPM cells to the cytotoxic 
effect of PMX. We here designed a PEG-coated TS shRNA lipoplex (PEG-coated TS 
shRNA-lipoplex) for systemic injection. PEG modification efficiently delivered TS 
shRNA in the lipoplex to tumor tissue following intravenous administration as indicated 
by a significant suppression of TS expression level in tumor tissue. In addition, the 
combined treatment of PMX with systemic injection of PEG-coated TS shRNA-
lipoplex exerted a potent antitumor activity in a s.c. xenograft tumor model, compared 
to a single treatment with either PMX or PEG-coated TS shRNA-lipoplex. Metastasis, 
or the spread, of mesothelioma substantially dedicates the effectiveness of treatment 
options. The systemic, in addition to local, delivery of tumor targeted anti-TS RNAi 
system we propose in this study might be an effective option to extend the clinical 
utility of PMX in treating malignant mesothelioma.  
 
INTRODUCTION 
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a locally invasive tumor mostly 
associated with past exposure to asbestos 1-3. Treatment strategies of MPM range from 
traditional chemotherapy to radical procedures to remove the cancerous tissue. However,

these therapeutic strategies showed poor prognosis due to either the development of 
drug resistance or the dissemination of the tumor to neighboring areas leading to 
"cancer metastasis" 4, 5. 
Pemetrexed (PMX), a relatively novel multi-targeted antifolate, is able to 
simultaneously inhibit multiple folate-dependent enzymes involved in the synthesis of 
purines and pyrimidines. PMX, as a single gent, has shown modest activity in a phase II 
trial of patients with MPM 6 and more recently it has been approved in combination 
with cisplatin as first-line treatment of MPM 7. However, the overall therapeutic 
outcome of patients with MPM remains very poor with response rates of approximately 
40%. Many reports have emphasized a correlation between high expression levels of 
thymidylate synthase (TS), an essential precursor for DNA synthesis 8, 9 and reduced 
sensitivity to PMX in different types of tumors including colon, lung and advanced 
breast cancer 10-13.  
Recently, we investigated the efficacy of chemically synthesized short hairpin 
RNA targeting TS (TS shRNA) in suppressing the TS expression, and thereby, 
modulating the cytotoxic effect of PMX against human mesotheliomal cell line, MSTO-
211H. In that study, we showed that intrapleural "local" injection of non-PEGylated TS 
shRNA-lipoplexes repressed the expression of TS mRNA in human malignant 
mesotheliomal MSTO-211H cells and suppressed tumor progression. In addition, the 
combined therapy of TS shRNA-lipoplex and PMX significantly suppressed the 
progression of orthotopic thoracic tumors, in tandem with, prolonging the survival of 
mice inoculated orthotopically with MSTO-211H cells, compared to a single treatment 
with either PMX or TS shRNA-lipoplex 14.

It is worth noting that MPM cells are not confined in the thoracic cavity but they 
have the potential to disseminate not only to neighboring tissues/organs such as regional 
lymph nodes, pericardium, peritoneum, chest wall but much far to reach the brain 15, 16. 
In addition, the therapeutic efficacy of intrapleurally administered therapeutic agents 
might be compromised, on the one hand, by the widespread distribution of thoracic 
tumors throughout the whole pleura and nearby tissues/organs and, on the other, by the 
excessive pleural effusion associated with MPM 17. In this study, therefore, we focused 
at evaluating the effectiveness of systemic administration of TS shRNA-lipoplex in 
sensitizing the mesotheliomal cells to the cytotoxic effect of PMX, using a 
subcutaneous xenograft mouse model. For systemic administration purpose, the 
composition of liposome of TS shRNA-lipoplex was manipulated to obtain PEG-coated 
TS shRNA-lipoplex. Inclusion of cholesterol, which has a membrane stabilizing effect, 
within liposomal membrane and grafting the hydrophilic polymer polyethylene glycol 
(PEG) onto the surface of liposomes were applied in order to enhance the in vivo 
stability/pharmacokinetics of administered TS shRNA-lipoplex following their systemic 
administration 18-20. We here showed that combined treatment of PMX with systemic 
injection of PEG-coated TS shRNA-lipoplex significantly suppressed tumor growth in a 
subcutaneous xenograft mouse model. It appears that systemic delivery of tumor 
targeted anti-TS RNAi molecule along with PMX treatment might be an effective 
therapeutic option, in addition to local delivery, in treating mesothelioma showing either 
localized or distant "metastasis".

Chemically synthesized shRNAs  
Purified chemically synthesized shRNAs were purchased from Hokkaido System 
Science (Sapporo, Japan). Two shRNAs were designed; one to target TS (TS shRNA) 
and the other was a nonspecific (NS shRNA, not to target any gene in human and mouse 
genome). The sequence of shRNA against TS was 5′-GUAACACCAUCGAUCAUGA 
UAGUGCUCCUGGUUGUCAUGAUCGAUGGUGUUACUU-3′ and for a nonspecific 
shRNA was 5′-UCUUAAUCGCGUAUAAGGCUAGUGCUCCUGGUUGGCCUUAU 
ACGCGAUUAAGAUU-3′. shRNAs were reconstituted in RNase free TE buffer at a 
final concentration of 100 µmol/l. 
Preparation of shRNA-lipoplex for in vitro transfection 
MSTO-211H cells were transfected with shRNA using Lipofectamine® 
RNAiMAX (LfRNAiMAX, Invitogen, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's 
instructions. In brief, 300 pmol shRNA and 15 µl LfRNAiMAX were diluted in Opti-
MEM I (Invitrogen, CA, USA) to a total volume of 500 µl, respectively. The diluted 
shRNA and LfRNAiMAX were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 20 min to 
form shRNA/LfRNAiMAX complex.  
In vitro gene knockdown by chemically synthesized shRNA transfection 
In vitro gene knockdown by chemically synthesized shRNA was examined with 
Western blotting as previously described 22. Briefly, cells (5 x 105 cells/10 cm dish) 
were seeded 24 h before shRNA transfection. The cells were transfected with 5 or 10 
nM of either TS shRNA or NS shRNA in the shRNA/LfRNAiMAX complex. Medium 
treated cells were served as control for the experiment. At 72 h post transfection, the 
cells were harvested, washed with chilled PBS and resuspended in ice-cold NP-40 lysis 
buffer (1% NP-40, 50 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate)

containing protease inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Mo, USA). The protein extract 
(20 µg per lane) was resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE gel (ATTO Corp., Tokyo, Japan) and 
transferred from gel to Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare, CA, 
USA) and then blocked with Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 5% BSA and 
0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at 25 °C. Membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C 
with primary antibody [(1:500 for mouse monoclonal anti-TS antibody (AnaSpec, CA, 
USA) or 1:5000 for mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (Abcam, Tokyo, Japan)]. 
Then membranes were further incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat 
antimouse secondary antibody (1:2,000, ICN Biomedical, CA, USA) at 25 °C 1 h. 
Finally, membranes were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (GE 
Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK), and the obtained images were then analyzed using 
Multi Gauge v.3.2 (FujiFilm, Tokyo, Japan). 
Cell viability assay 
MSTO-211H cells (2 x 103) were seeded in 96-well plates in 200 µl RPMI-1640 
medium. At 24 h post incubation, the cells were transfected with 5 or 10 nM of either 
TS shRNA or NS shRNA in the shRNA/LfRNAiMAX complex and further incubated 
for 24 h. Then, a fresh medium containing either 0.01 or 10 µg/ml PMX was added. 
After different incubation time intervals (24, 48, 72 and 96 h), MTT assay was 
conducted as described previously 23.  
Apoptosis analysis  
Cell apoptosis assay was done using Annexin-V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit 
(Roche) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Briefly, cells (40000 
cells/well) were seeded in six-well plates 24 h before chemically synthesized shRNA 
transfection. The cells were transfected with 5 or 10 nM of either TS shRNA or NS

shRNA in the shRNA/LfRNAiMAX complex for 24 h. After the transfection, fresh 
medium with or without PMX (0.01 µg/ml) was added and the cells were further 
incubated for different time intervals (24, 48, 72 and 96 h) at 37 °C. Then, the cells were 
harvested, washed, and centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were resuspended 
in 100 µl of Annexin-V-FLUOS labeling solution and incubated in dark for 10-15 min 
at room temperature. Apoptotic cells were analyzed using flow cytometer, Guava 
EasyCyte Mini System (Guava Technologies, CA, USA), and the sample data were 
analyzed using CytoSoft software (Guava Technologies). All experiments were 
performed in triplicates. 
Preparation of PEG-coated shRNA-lipoplexes (PEG-coated TS shRNA-lipoplex) 
Cationic liposome composed of DOPE:CHOL:POPC:DC-6-14 (3::3:2:2, molar 
ratio) was prepared as described previously 24. The mean diameter and zeta potential for 
cationic liposomes were 113.2 ± 10.2 nm and 25.3 ± 0.9 mV (n = 3), respectively, as 
determined with Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd., UK). For the 
determination of liposomal phospholipids concentration, a colorimetric assay was 
applied 25.  
For the preparation of shRNA lipoplexes, shRNA and cationic liposome were 
mixed at a molar ratio of 2000/1 (lipid/shRNA) under heavy vortex mixing conditions. 
The zeta potential and mean diameter of shRNA-lipoplex were 18.6 ± 1.3 mV  and 
392.1 ± 37.0 nm (n=3), respectively. For systemic application, shRNA-lipoplex was 
surface-decorated by polyethylene glycol (PEG)-conjugated lipid using a post-insertion 
technique as described previously 26. The mean diameter and zeta potential of PEG-
coated shRNA-lipoplex were 403.4 ± 26.2 nm and 16.1 ± 1.8 mV (n=3), respectively. 
To identify the presence of free-shRNA in the prepared PEG-coated shRNA-lipoplex,

electrophoresis was conducted on 2% agarose gel in 40 mM Tris–acetate buffer 
containing 1 mM EDTA and shRNA detection was performed using a UV 
transilluminator. The absence of bands related to free shRNA verified that practically 
100% of the shRNA was complexed with PEG-coated lipoplex under our preparation 
condition (Fig. S1). The in vitro stability of prepared shRNA-lipoplex was also 
investigated in presence of mouse serum to verify the stability of our formulated 
lipoplex (Fig. S2).  
In vivo antitumor activity by the combined treatment with chemically synthesized 
TS shRNA and PMX 
To establish the subcutaneous xenograft model, human MSTO-211H cells (5 × 
106/100 µl PBS) were subcutaneously inoculated into the back region of 5-week-old 
male BALB/c nu/nu mice. The animals were then randomly grouped and treated with 
9% sucrose (control), PEG-coated NS shRNA-lipoplex, PEG-coated TS shRNA-
lipoplex, or PMX as  single agents, or a combination of PMX with either PEG-coated 
NS shRNA-lipoplex or PEG-coated TS shRNA-lipoplex. The tumor size was measured 
every three-day by a caliper, and tumor volume was estimated using the formula: tumor 
volume (mm3) = (length) x (width)2 x 0.5 27. Treated versus control percentage [T/C (%) 
was calculated using the following formula: 
T/C (%) = [(relative tumor volumes in the treated group / the control group) x 100] 
Where, the relative tumor volume = final tumor volume / initial tumor volume 28. PEG-
coated lipoplex containing TS shRNA or NS shRNA (40 µg/mouse) was intravenously 
injected every other day (on day 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 and 17), and PMX (25 or 100 mg/kg) 
was intraperitoneally (i.p.) administered days 7-11 and 14-18, after the tumor cell 
inoculation. The PMX doses were selected based on the doses reported in many

preclinical studies 12, 29 and on our preliminarily experiments (data not shown). At the 
end of therapeutic experiments (i.e. when tumor size exceeded 1500 mm3 in volume), 
mice were euthanized, tumors were dissected and tumor specimens were analyzed for 
both the in vivo gene knockdown efficiency (suppression of TS protein expression) and 
the induction of apoptosis within tumor tissue. For, the in vivo gene knock down 
efficiency of different treatments, Western blotting was performed as aforementioned. 
For detection of apoptotic cells in the tumor tissue, TUNEL assay using In Situ Cell 
Death Detection Kit, Texas red (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) was carried out as 
described previously 19. Induction of apoptosis in tumor sections was observed by using 
a fluorescence microscope (Axiovert 200M; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), and the 
numbers of apoptotic cells in each tumor section were estimated in ten different 
microscopic fields using analyze software (AxioVision; Zeiss).  
Biodistribution and tumor accumulation of PEG-coated shRNA-lipoplexes  
           To assess the tissue distribution of PEG-coated TS shRNA-lipoplex, MSTO 
211H tumor-bearing mice were intravenously injected with 3H-CHE-labeled TS 
shRNA-lipoplexes (25 mg phospholipid/kg body weight). Twenty-four h post test-
lipoplex injection, blood samples (100 µl) were collected from the retro-orbital sinus, 
and the livers, spleens and tumors were dissected. Radioactivity in blood and collected 
tissues was then assayed, as described previously 30.  
Statistical analysis 
The data were expressed as mean ± SD and analyzed using GraphPad InStat 
View software (GraphPad Software, CA, USA). A two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test 
was performed to determine the significance of the differences between groups. The 
level of significance was set at p < 0.05.

RESULTS 
Effect of shRNA transfection on TS expression in human mesothelioma cell line 
(MSTO-211H) 
The gene knockdown efficiency of chemically synthesized TS shRNA on TS 
expression was estimated in MSTO-211H cells by using Western blotting. As shown in 
Fig. 1A, TS shRNA strongly suppressed TS expression at both shRNA concentrations 
used (5 nM and 10 nM), whereas the nonspecific shRNA (NS shRNA) had no effect on 
the TS expression at the same condition. Under this experimental condition, the 
knockdown efficacy of TS shRNA was approximately 75%, compared with the NS 
shRNA (Fig. 1B).

Effect of TS knockdown on chemosensitivity of mesothelioma MSTO-211H cell 
line to PMX in vitro 
    At first, the cytotoxicity of PMX 
against 
MSTO-211H 
cells 
was 
investigated. As shown in Fig. 2, PMX 
significantly reduced cell survival in a 
dose- and time-dependent manner with a 
maximum 
cellular 
growth 
inhibition 
observed at 96 h post-incubation; IC50 at 
96 h was 24.64 ± 0.001 ng/ml versus 828.6 
± 0.012 or 38.82 ± 0.001 ng/ml at 48 or 72 
h post-incubation, respectively.  
 
Next, we studied the contribution of TS shRNA-mediated TS-protein 
suppression to the cytotoxicity of PMX. MSTO-211H cells were transfected with 
chemically synthesized TS shRNA, and then treated with PMX (0.01 or 1 µg/ml) for 
different times (24, 48, 72 and 96 h). As shown in Fig. 3A and 3B, at low PMX 
concentration (0.01 µg/ml; lower than IC50 of PMX at 96 h), treatment with TS shRNA 
resulted in an increased sensitivity of MSTO-211H cells to PMX in a time-dependent 
manner, as compared with treatment with NS shRNA. A maximal cellular growth 
inhibition (more than 80%) was reached at 72 h post-transfection (Fig. 3A and 3B). On 
the other hand, at higher PMX concentration (1 µg/ml) the effect of suppression of TS 
expression on the cytotoxicity of PMX was negligible, where, a combination of TS 
shRNA and PMX did not show any superior cytotoxicity over PMX alone after any 
incubation time (Fig. 3C and 3D). Taken together, the results suggest that down- 
regulation of TS protein expression significantly enhanced the chemosensitivity of 
mesothelioma MSTO-211H cells to PMX, raising the chance for reducing each dose, 
and thereby, the total dose of PMX when the combined therapy is carried out.

Induction of apoptosis by a combined treatment with chemically synthesized TS 
shRNA and PMX in vitro 
To gain further insight into the effect of suppression of TS expression on the 
chemosensitivity of MSTO-211H cells to PMX, cellular apoptosis was determined 
using flow cytometric analysis of annexin V stained cells at different incubation time 
with PMX (24, 48, 72 and 96 h). As shown in Fig. 4A and 4B, monotreatment with 
either shRNAs (TS shRNA or NS shRNA) or PMX did not induce significant apoptosis 
of MSTO-211H cells. In the NS shRNA-transfected cells, no significant change in the 
percent of apoptotic cells was induced by PMX treatment. On the other hand, in the TS 
shRNA-transfected cells, PMX treatment induced a 4.5 fold increase in the percentage 
of apoptotic cells, compared with the cells treated with combination of of NS shRNA 
and PMX, peaking at 72 h post-incubation.

In vivo antitumor effect of the combined treatment with chemically synthesized TS 
shRNA and PMX in MSTO-211H xenograft model 
To scrutinize the effect of 
suppression of TS expression on 
tumor growth in vivo, the antitumor 
efficacy of the combined treatment 
of TS shRNA and PMX was 
evaluated 
in 
xenograft 
mouse 
model with MSTO-211H. Mono-
treatment with NS shRNA did not 
suppress tumor growth [T/C (%) 
 
= 98.64%] (Fig. 5). Mono-treatment with either TS shRNA or PMX, or a combination 
treatment with NS shRNA and PMX slightly suppressed tumor growth [T/C (%) =

77.53%, 76.50% and 81.28%, respectively]. Combination treatment of TS shRNA and 
PMX caused a potent tumor growth inhibition [T/C (%) = 37.14%], compared with 
other treatments (p < 0.01). Notably, all treatments were well tolerated as manifested by 
the absence of remarkable body weight loss among any of the treated animals (data not 
shown). These results suggest that combined treatment with TS shRNA and PMX exerts 
a potent antitumor efficacy without causing remarkable toxicity, relating to body weight 
loss, in a human mesothelioma xenograft mouse model. 
Biodistribution and tumor accumulation of test TS shRNA-lipoplex 
            The biodistribution pattern of PEG-coated TS shRNA lipoplex was evaluated 
following the intravenous injection of radio-labeled lipoplexes into MSTO-211 tumor-
bearing mice. Test lipoplex distributed/accumulated substantially in the liver and spleen 
at 24 h post test lipoplex injection (Fig. 6). Such preferential accumulation of test 
lipoplex in the major eliminating organs might explain the relatively low blood 
concentration of test dose. Nonetheless, no remarkable accumulation of test lipoplex 
was detected in either kidneys or lungs (Fig. 6). The tumor accumulation of test 
lipoplex was also assessed at 24 h post test lipoplex injection. As depicted in Fig. 6, test 
PEG-coated lipoplex accumulated to a certain extent in the tumor tissue. These results 
imply that the efficient antitumor efficacy of a combined treatment of PMX and PEG-
coated TS shRNA is attributed, at least in part, to the efficient accumulation and/or 
delivery of TS shRNA within tumor tissue.

DISCUSSION 
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) represents an immense challenge 
because of its poor prognosis and remarkable resistance to current therapies 31, 32. 
Clinically, pemetrexed (PMX) represents a mainstay in most applied MPM therapeutic 
strategies. However, its antitumor efficacy is severely restrained by the development of 
drug resistance. Thymidylate synthase (TS), a folate-dependent enzyme, is considered 
the main target of PMX 33, 34. Many reports have indicated that TS expression in various 
tumors is prognostic for poor outcome in patients treated with PMX 35, 36. Recently, we 
emphasized that down-regulation of TS expression, using a chemically synthesized 
short hairpin RNA (shRNA), significantly increased the chemosensitivity of 
mesotheliomal MSTO-211H cells to PMX. In addition, we confirmed that the combined 
treatment of PMX and locally administered non PEGylated TS shRNA lipoplex 
substantially alleviated the progression of orthotopic thoracic tumors compared to each 
single treatment 14.  
Nevertheless, many reports have recently revealed the ability of MPM cells to 
metastasize not only to neighboring tissues/organs such as regional lymph nodes, 
pericardium, peritoneum, chest wall but much far to reach the brain 15, 16. In addition, 
the broad invasion of the whole pleura with thoracic tumors, in tandem with the 
mechanical stress imparted by pleural fluids associated with MPM could collectively 
compromise the efficacy of locally administered therapeutic agents. Instead, systemic 
administration of the therapeutic agent become a prerequisite. In the current study, 
therefore, we assessed the effectiveness of "systemically" administered PEG-coated TS 
shRNA-lipoplex in sensitizing the mesotheliomal cells to the cytotoxic effect of PMX 
using a subcutaneous xenograft mouse model. Combined therapy of PMX and

"systemically" administered PEG-coated TS shRNA-lipoplex showed a superior 
antitumor efficacy compared with monotherapy with either agent alone or a combined 
therapy with PMX and NS shRNA in MSTO-211H tumor xenograft mouse model (Fig. 
5). This potent antitumor efficacy was achieved mainly via the induction of a potent 
apoptotic response in MSTO-211H tumors (Fig. 7B and 7C). Taken together, these 
findings may provide a proof—of—concept that the combined therapy of PMX and the 
tumor targeted anti-TS RNAi system (PEG-coated TS shRNA-lipoplex) represents a 
promising alternative therapy to the currently applied dismally effective therapeutic 
strategies for the treatment of human MPM. 
Interestingly, we observed that a combined treatment of TS shRNA and high 
dose PMX (100 mg/kg) neither additively nor synergistically cause the tumor growth 
suppression (Fig. S3). Several studies have revealed that after the exposure to 
fluoropyrimidines or anti-folate TS inhibitors, the TS protein expression is induced in 
preclinical models, both cell lines and animal models 11, 37, 38. Thus, small-molecule TS 
inhibitors can actually antagonize their therapy by promoting over-expression of TS. 
Based on these reports, we assume that treatment with a high dose of PMX (100 mg/kg) 
might result in an acute elevation in TS protein expression level. Thus, TS shRNA 
might not be efficient to completely suppress TS protein expression. On the other hand, 
treatment with a comparatively lower dose of PMX (25 mg/kg) might not trigger 
MSTO-211H cells to elevate TS protein expression level, leading to a superior tumor 
growth inhibition (Fig. 5). These results obviously reveal that the therapeutic efficacy of 
PMX, in combination with TS shRNA, is mediated in a PMX dose-dependent manner. 
However, further studies are urged to precisely determine the optimal therapeutic 
window of PMX required to obtain the maximal antitumor efficacy.

For advanced clinical application of the RNAi technique, specific and effective 
delivery of chemically synthesized siRNA or shRNA to target tumor tissue should be 
granted. Recently, it was revealed that nanocarrier systems, such as nanomicelles and 
liposomes, containing siRNAs efficiently suppressed tumor growth in animal models 39-
41. In this study, we also confirmed that PEGylated cationic liposome, was efficient in 
the systemic delivery of chemically synthesized shRNA to the target site as reflected by 
the superior antitumor efficacy (Fig. 5) and the higher apoptotic potential (Figs. 7A and 
7B) induced by the combined therapy of TS shRNA-lipoplex  and PMX without 
exerting severe side effects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first observation 
showing the efficacy of PEGylated cationic liposomes in delivering chemically 
synthesized shRNA to tumor tissues following their intravenous administartion.  
Currently, many therapeutic strategies are available for the treatment of 
localized primary tumors including surgical intervention, radio-/chemo-therapy or a 
combined approach. However, effective treatment of primary tumors along with local or 
distant metastasis, particularly micro-metastases, is generally limited. Metastases, 
resulted from local and/or distant dissemination of malignant cells to the neighboring 
and/or far tissues, usually cause tumor recurrence and eventual treatment failure. An 
effective strategy to conquer both primary tumor and metastatic lesions are urgently 
needed for the complete cure of cancer. Systemic treatment strategy is one of the 
effective therapeutic approaches strategies to treat both primary tumor and metastatic 
lesions. In the current study, we evidently demonstrated that systemically administered 
TS shRNA was efficient in the down-regulation of in vivo TS expression. In addition, 
the suppression of TS expression is associated with the increased in vivo antitumor 
efficacy of PMX in human MPM tumor-bearing mice model. These results imply that

our tumor targeted anti-TS RNAi system could augment the therapeutic potential of 
PMX in many clinical settings. Consequently, the combined therapy of PMX and anti-
TS RNAi system would represent a promising alternative therapeutic strategy to the 
currently applied therapeutic modalities for the treatment of human MPM especially 
those showing local and/or distance metastasis.

Figure legends 
Figure 1. Suppression of TS protein expression by the transfection with chemically 
synthesized TS shRNA in human mesothelioma MSTO-211H cell line.  
(A) TS protein expression in control, nonspecific (NS) shRNA-, or TS shRNA-
transfected MSTO-211H cells 72 h after transfection, as determined by Western 
blotting. β-actin was used for equal loading assessments. (B) Quantitative evaluation of 
the percent change in expression levels of TS protein against β-actin one. Data 
represents mean ± S.D from three independent experiments.  
 
Figure 2. In vitro cytotoxicity of PMX on human mesothelioma MSTO-211H cells.  
MSTO-211H cells were incubated with media containing serial dilutions of 
PMX for different time intervals (24, 48, 72 or 96 h). After the specified incubation 
time, the medium was removed and cell survival was determined by the MTT assay. 
Data represent mean ± S.D. (n = 3).  
 
Figure 3. Effect of TS gene knockdown on the chemosensitivity of human 
mesothelioma MSTO-211H cells to PMX.  
MSTO-211H cells were transfected or not with either 5 or 10 nM of nonspecific 
(NS) shRNA or TS shRNA. At 24 h post-transfection, fresh media containing PMX 
(0.01 or 1 µg/ml) were added and the cells were further incubated for different time 
intervals (24, 48, 72 or 96 h). Cell viability was then determined by MTT assay. Data 
were represented from three independent experiments. ***p< 0.001 versus TS shRNA- 
or PMX-treated cells.

Figure 4. Induction of apoptosis in human mesothelioma MSTO-211H cells by a 
combined treatment with PMX and TS shRNA in vitro. 
MSTO-211H cells were transfected or not with either 5 or 10 nM of nonspecific 
(NS) shRNA or TS shRNA. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were further treated with 
0.01 µg/ml PMX. Apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry. Data represent mean ± 
S.D. (%)  from three independent experiments. *p< 0.05. 
 
Figure 5. Tumor growth suppression by combination therapy of PMX plus PEG-
coated TS shRNA lipoplexes in human mesothelioma (MSTO-211H) tumor-
bearing mice. 
Tumor xenograft animal model was established by subcutaneous inoculation of 
MSTO-211H cells in nude mice. PMX (25 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally administered 
daily for 5 consecutive days/week for two weeks. PEG-coated shRNA-lipoplex 
containing either nonspecific (NS) shRNA or TS shRNA (40 µg shRNA/mouse) was 
intravenously injected every 2 days (on day 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 and 17 after tumor cell 
inoculation). For the control group, sucrose was administered instead of PMX or PEG-
coated shRNA-lipoplexes. Data represent mean ± S.D. (n = 6). ***p< 0.001.  
 
Figure 6: Biodistribution and intratumoral accumulation of test TS shRNA-
lipoplex. 
MSTO211H-bearing mice were intravenously injected with radio-labeled TS 
shRNA-lipoplex (25 mg phospholipid/kg body weight). At 24 h after injection, blood 
and major organs were collected and their level of radioactivity was determined. Data 
represent mean ± SD (n=3).

Figure 7. Suppression of TS protein and apoptosis induction in the human 
mesothelioma cell (MSTO-211H) tumor tissue by a combined treatment with PMX 
and PEG-coated TS shRNA-lipoplex. 
MSTO-211H tumor-bearing mice were treated in the same way as described 
above. When tumor xenograft exceeded 1500 mm3 in volume, mice were euthanized, 
and tumors were excised. Specimens of tumors were weighed and analyzed with 
Western blotting and TUNEL assay. (A) TS protein expression was determined by 
Western blot analysis. (B) Representative immunofluorescent tumor sections (TUNEL: 
Red, Hoechst 33342: Blue). The bar indicates 50 µm. Original magnification, x 400. (C) 
Percent of TUNEL-positive cells in the section. Data represent the mean ± S.D. ***p< 
0.001 versus sucrose. ###p< 0.01 versus PMX or PEG-coated TS shRNA-lipoplex.
