Abstract
Background: The general aim of this research was to determine whether cessation of community water fluoridation
(CWF) increased oral health disparities, as measured by dental caries procedures and restoration costs for
children and adolescents.
Methods: The analysis was based on all Medicaid dental claims records of 0- to 18-year-old patients residing in zip
code 99801 (Juneau, Alaska) during an optimal CWF year (2003, n = 853) compared to all claims for the same age
group from 2012 (n = 1052), five years after cessation of CWF. A bivariate analysis (Mann-Whitney U test) of the mean
number of caries procedures performed per client was conducted in the study groups under both independent CWF
conditions. Furthermore, logistic regression was performed using the dependent variables of caries procedures and the
cost of caries-related procedures, with adjustments for CWF group, gender, and race.
Results: The statistically significant results included a higher mean number of caries-related procedures among 0- to
18-year-old and < 7-year-old patients in the suboptimal CWF group (2.35 vs. 2.02, p < 0.001; 2.68 vs. 2.01, p = 0.004,
respectively). The mean caries-related treatment costs per patient were also significantly higher for all age groups,
ranging from a 28 to 111% increase among the suboptimal CWF cohorts after adjusting for inflation. The binary logistic
regression analysis results indicated a protective effect of optimal CWF for the 0- to 18-year-old and < 7-year-old age
groups (OR = 0.748, 95% CI [0.62, 0.90], p = 0.002; OR = 0.699, 95% CI [0.52, 0.95], p = 0.02, respectively). Additionally, the
age group that underwent the most dental caries procedures and incurred the highest caries treatment costs on
average were those born after CWF cessation.
Conclusions: These results expand our understanding of caries epidemiology under CWF cessation conditions and
reaffirm that optimal CWF exposure prevents dental decay. These findings can offer fiscal estimates of the cost burden
associated with CWF cessation policies and help decision-makers advance oral health, prevent dental caries, and
promote equity in oral health outcomes.

Introduction
While the oral health of most Americans has improved
over the last century, it remains a significant unmet health
care need for children and structurally marginalized
groups [1, 2]. Dental caries continues to be the most com-
mon chronic childhood disease, and dental pain is the sec-
ond most common cause of school absences [1, 3, 4].
Importantly, the burden of negative oral health outcomes
is disproportionately borne by vulnerable groups, includ-
ing those least able to advocate for themselves, such as
children, members of non-majority ethnic groups and
low-income families [5–7].
From
the
1930s
through
the
early
part
of
the
twenty-first century, the research community has dedi-
cated time and resources toward producing and review-
ing
comparison
studies

fluoridated communities [8]. Investigating potential as-
sociations among optimal community water fluoridation

 (CWF) and reductions in both pediatric dental caries
and adult tooth loss are also important for improving
economic, racial, and ethnic disparities in oral health
[9–15]. Over the decades, researchers have established a
large body of empirical work supporting both the effi-
cacy and safety standards of CWF systems, which are
often summarized in major meta reviews [2, 7, 16–19].
In addition to caries prevention, studies have demon-
strated the treatment cost savings secondary to CWF.
For example, estimates specify that for every $1 spent on
oral health preventative measures, such as CFW, tax-
payers can save $50 in annual treatment costs for each
low-income citizen who relies on state and federal sub-
sidies for dental care [3, 16, 20–24].
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control, along with sev-
eral independent commissions, conclude that CWF is
both a safe and cost-effective method for decreasing
dental disease and caries among populations, regardless
of age or income [3, 11, 18, 19, 21, 25]. Two large
meta-reviews with different inclusion parameters noted
that much of the evidence regarding CWF is based on
mid- to late-twentieth century studies and cautioned
about the applicability of the findings to modern condi-
tions with widely available fluoridated toothpaste and
advanced dental technologies [18, 19]. In 2010, the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services convened an
interagency panel to review all the available evidence re-
garding CWF and its potential positive and negative
health effects [7]. The panel determined that even after
the introduction and widespread availability of fluori-
dated toothpaste, U.S. populations still benefited from
CWF as a result of reductions in tooth decay up to 25%
[7, 14, 21]. This panel also found that the only negative
health effect associated with optimal CWF, even at
higher than recommended levels (2–4 ppm), was severe
dental fluorosis [7]. Therefore, considering the concerns
regarding
dental
fluorosis,
particularly
for
children
whose teeth are still developing, the U.S. Public Health
Service issued a new recommendation that community
water programs fluoridate the water supply at 0.7 mg/L
versus the previous range of 0.7–1.2 mg/L given the
multiple sources of fluoride in the modern context and
to balance decay prevention benefits while reducing the
risk of dental fluorosis [2, 7]. Recent trends toward CWF
discontinuation in public water systems represent an op-
portunity to evaluate caries epidemiology and caries
treatment cost variations under suboptimal CWF condi-
tions [26]. Given the relatively new phenomenon of pol-
icy change inspired by CWF cessation advocacy groups,
the impact on population health after removing expos-
ure to optimal fluoride levels in public water systems re-
mains understudied [27–29].
The epidemiological impact of CWF discontinuation
has been analyzed in only a small number of studies,
and the results have been mixed [25–30]. Additionally,
whether specific age groups or income levels are more
or less at risk for caries development following CWF
cessation has not yet been established [25–30]. The first
known meta-analysis of CWF cessation reviewed 13
multidisciplinary databases, and the authors noted only
15 research instances in which CWF cessation was the
studied intervention [26]. These publications occurred
over several decades, from 1956 to 2003, and repre-
sented
thirteen
different
countries
[26].
Variations
among these published works include methodological
factors, such as utilization of a comparison group for
whom CWF was not ceased, application of a concurrent
cross-sectional versus time series approach, and differ-
ences in the type of metric utilized – typically full dental
records, claims records or open-mouth screening exams
(i.e., DMFT scores), and contextual factors, such as the
time interval post-cessation, healthcare delivery systems,
local socio-economic conditions and consideration of
other sources of fluoride in the community (the intro-
duction of fluoride rinse programs, supplements, or
available fluoride salts) [26]. This research intends to
contribute to the growing CWF cessation evidence base
by assessing and quantifying oral health changes second-
ary to CWF discontinuation among Medicaid-eligible
children and adolescents in Juneau, Alaska, using docu-
mentation of caries-related procedures from Medicaid
dental claims records six years post-CWF cessation.
According to the previous Surgeon General of the
United States, as a nation, approximately 75% of the
population has access to optimally fluoridated water
[31]. The Healthy People 2020 [32] objective on CWF
aims to increase that percentage to 79.6% of the popula-
tion receiving the optimum level of CWF associated with
caries prevention (0.7 mg/L or 0.7 ppm) in community
water sources. However, the percentage of Alaska’s
population served by CWF was 65% in 2007 and fell to
49.3% in 2014 as a result of local city officials changing
the public water fluoridation policies [33]. City assem-
blies in both Juneau (2007) and Fairbanks (2011) reversed
CWF policies citing a ‘lack of evidence’ regarding the oral
health benefits and risks of CWF [34]. Currently, the oral
health impacts of these local water policy decisions on
population oral health in Alaska remain unknown.
This research aimed to assess the impacts of these de-
cisions using the following three research objectives.
The first objective was to determine the extent to which
CWF
cessation
impacts
the
frequency
of
dental
caries-related procedures among Medicaid-eligible chil-
dren and adolescents. The second objective was to deter-
mine the extent to which CWF cessation impacts caries
severity as measured by caries-related treatment costs
among Medicaid-eligible children and adolescents. The
third objective was to determine the extent to which

 CWF cessation impacts caries development rates for
specific age cohorts among Medicaid-eligible children
and adolescents. Recent trends toward CWF discontinu-
ation from public water systems represent an opportun-
ity to evaluate caries epidemiology and caries treatment
cost variations under suboptimal CWF conditions [26].
Methods
Juneau served as an ideal study population, with 96% of
the residents in zip code 99801 serviced by city water
[35, 36]. The rugged terrain of Southeast Alaska makes
Juneau one of only two U.S. state capitals accessible only
by plane or sea. While Juneau lacks connections to
major road systems, thus mitigating the risk of con-
founding from optimal CWF exposure due to in-and-out
migration or travel from neighboring counties (also
known as the ‘halo’ effect), it maintains all the modern
conveniences that one would expect in the third largest
Alaskan city – including schools, public transportation,
a hospital, multiple clinics and a variety of dental profes-
sional offices, as well as the Southeast Alaska Tribal
Health Consortium (SEARHC) headquarters. We also
note the widespread availability of fluoridated toothpaste
before, during, and after the study at retail outlets, as
well as the distribution of such toothpaste to patients at
dental clinics. The annual residential population charac-
teristics are similar to those that we may observe on an
island or in a closed population. For example, the Juneau
census reported a population of 31,283 in 2003 and
32,832 in 2012, reflecting a total increase of 1549 over
the nine-year period. In other words, a small population
increase of 0.006%, or 172 persons, per year occurred
during the study period [37, 38].
The target population of this study included children
and adolescents between the ages of 0–18 years living in
families whose incomes met Medicaid requirements.
The eligibility requirements for Alaskans seeking Medic-
aid includes children up to 18 years old if the family in-
come does not exceed 150–200% of the Federal Poverty
Level [39]. Medicaid income limits vary depending on
family size. The rationale for this focus was to assess
two groups living in the same zip code with similar ages
and economic experiences at two points in time, thus
mitigating the influence of confounding factors known
to influence oral health status, such as parent educa-
tional attainment and wide variations in income [40].
Families living in poverty also represent a vulnerable
group likely to be affected by CWF cessation policy deci-
sions and the group that is least able to participate in
health policy decision-making processes [4, 24, 41]. As
the entire study population was sourced from a homoge-
neous economic group at two different time points, we
were able to observe the influences of the independent
variable (CWF) on the dependent variables (dental caries
procedures and treatment costs) both before and after
CWF cessation.
The retrospective comparative research design pro-
vided a method for investigating the main effect of CWF
removal from community water systems on pediatric
and adolescent oral health using Medicaid dental claims
billing records. Data from Medicaid dental claims have
been utilized in previous research, and the form is stan-
dardized by the American Dental Association to specify
demographic indicators, exact procedure codes, reim-
bursement rates and provider service charges [16, 22, 23,
42]. Data were secured from all Medicaid dental claims
records submitted during 2003, three years prior to ces-
sation,
and
2012,
six
years
post-cessation,
for
all
Medicaid-eligible children aged 0 to 18 years residing in
the 99801 zip code who were examined by a dentist.
The State of Alaska Chief Dental Officer confirmed that
Juneau had been optimally fluoridated since the early
1980s, noting a ‘fluoride stoppage’ during the last half of
2003 to study pipe corrosion, although documentation
of the actual study was not available (Dr. Whistler, per-
sonal communication, February 2, 2016). Therefore, the
year 2003 was selected to obtain a clean representation
of optimal (0.7 mg/L-1.2 mg/L) CWF exposure. Medicaid
claims records were not available from the central Me-
dicaid processing center for the period after 2012 for Al-
aska; therefore, as CWF cessation occurred in January of
2007, 2012 was selected as the comparison year to
maximize the number of children in the sample with
only suboptimal (< 0.065 mg/L) CWF exposure as mea-
sured annually from 2007 through 2012 [35].
Walden University’s Institutional Review Board ap-
proved the study (Walden IRB #10–31–16-0075333).
Then, the dental claims database was released after ap-
proval by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Re-
search Unit [43, 44]. Due to high database costs
($10,500 USD) and study time constraints, only two
years of claims were purchased.
The entire study population, including both 2003 and
2012, yielded 1905 patients, exceeding required sample
size estimates. All dental claims records for every individ-
ual meeting the zip code and age criteria during the study
years were reviewed and coded according to study param-
eters (i.e., Levels 1–4). In 2003, under optimal CWF con-
ditions, the sample size for the 0- to 18-year age group
was 853, and in 2012, under suboptimal CWF conditions,
the sample included all claims for 1052 patients. Nation-
ally standardized dental code reference material, specific-
ally, Current Dental Terminology (CDT) codes used for
procedure and service claim reimbursement, were publicly
available for referencing procedure types and costs for
both study years. Overall, CDT claims reimbursement
rates do not change year to year like Current Procedural
Terminology (CPT) codes typically used in medicine.

 According to the retired State Dental Chief Dr. Whistler
(personal communication August 1, 2018), Medicaid
made adjustments in the form of increases for dental
claims CDT codes in 2009 and 2010, which may have re-
sulted in Medicaid reimbursement increases even without
provision of more services. From 2003 to 2008, the Medic-
aid dental reimbursement rate would largely have been
the same (i.e., remained unchanged). Therefore, since this
study spanned 2003 and 2012, provider service fees were
the more consistent metric and could also be adjusted for
inflation, thus allowing comparisons.
Further variables were developed to accurately address
the research objectives. In addition to sorting data into
age group cohorts, a variable reflecting the number of
caries-related procedures and total costs for caries-re-
lated procedures was used. More specifically, all dental
procedure codes were organized into four levels. Level 1
represented the type of oral exam (e.g., partial or com-
prehensive), Level 2 represented preventative care (e.g.,
x-rays, sealants or fluoride varnish), Level 3 represented
caries-related services (e.g., restoration by amalgam,
resin, crown, filling under sedation or endodontic/root
canal treatments), and Level 4 represented all other ser-
vices, such as extractions and surgeries. While some
Level 4 procedures were likely caries-related, such as ex-
tractions, we were not able to confirm this assumption
by CDT codes alone as they lack diagnostic details.
Therefore, to maximize precision regarding decay with-
out a full medical record, the claims for extractions and
outpatient surgeries were not included in the analysis.
The study objectives required analysis of the Level 3
category of procedure claims. We manually counted the
number of caries-related claims (Level 3 claims) and the
total dollar amount charged by the service provider for
these restorative treatments. For example, if a patient
had a one-surface primary amalgam restoration and a
three-surface anterior resin restoration during the study
year, then this patient’s experience would be summed as
two caries-related procedures, along with the total
caries-related costs for these specific procedures.
Descriptive statistics were calculated in SPSS for the
independent variable of CWF and the dependent vari-
ables of dental caries procedures and dental caries-re-
lated costs, followed by adjustments for gender and race.
Adjustments for income and parental educational attain-
ment were not applied since the entire sample included
only low-income participants whose family incomes met
the criteria for Medicaid eligibility. Parent education was
not a variable in the database, but it is assumed to be
similar between the two study years since the child or
adolescent was receiving Medicaid benefits. Qualification
for Medicaid was and remains based on income level
and varies by family size, disability status, and other met-
rics. For example, in 2003, the poverty level for a family
of three in Alaska was defined as an annual income of
$15,140, and in 2012, the income level was $23, 870 [45,
46]. Medicaid expansion in Alaska did not occur until
2015 under the Affordable Care Act. Proximity to a den-
tal provider in the small community of Juneau, which
utilizes public transit and has approximately 40 miles of
paved, two-lane highway, remained unchanged during
the study period.
Results
Univariate analysis of the data indicated that half of
the participants were male (51.2%). Slightly more than
one-half (53.9%) of the participants self-identified as
American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN), and 30.9%
self-identified as white/Caucasian. While the AI/AN
community accounts for only 13.4% of Alaska’s total
population, they are over-represented in the Medicaid
group due to historical oppression resulting in pov-
erty. Table 1 summarizes the full descriptive statistics
of the complete study population for the 0- to 18-
year-old age groups.
We conducted a bivariate analysis of the mean number
of caries procedures for the study groups under both
conditions to address the first research objective asses-
sing the extent to which CWF cessation impacts the fre-
quency of dental caries procedures. According to the
results of a Shapiro-Wilk test (p < 0.0001), the data were
not normally distributed. Therefore, a Mann-Whitney U
test was used to evaluate the difference in the mean
number of dental caries-related procedures per child be-
tween the two independent CWF groups of different
sizes. The results in Table 2 demonstrate that the mean
number of caries-related procedures for the 0- to
18-year-old age groups was significantly higher in the
suboptimal CWF group than that in the optimal CWF
group (2.35 vs. 2.02, p < 0.001). The binary logistic re-
gression results indicated that the odds ratio for patients
aged 0 to 18 years living under optimal CWF conditions
to receive a dental caries procedure was 0.748, indicating
a protective effect (OR = 0.748, 95% CI [0.62, 0.90], p <
0.0001). In other words, the odds of a child or adoles-
cent undergoing a dental caries procedure in 2003 was
25.2% less than that of a child or adolescent in the sub-
optimal CWF group.
Our analysis for the second research objective yielded
similar results (Table 3). The mean caries-related treat-
ment cost for the 0- to 18-year-old age cohort was sig-
nificantly higher in the suboptimal CWF group than that
in the optimal CWF group ($593.70 vs. $344.34, p <
0.0001) without adjusting for inflation. According to the
U.S. Department of Labor Consumer Price Index [47],
the inflation rate increased an estimated 24.75% between
2003 and 2012. Therefore, the increase in inflation-ad-
justed provider service charges in caries treatment costs
Meyer et al. BMC Oral Health          (2018) 18:215 
Page 4 of 10
 associated with CWF cessation for the 0- to 18-year-old
age group was + 47%, or $161.84. According to logistic
regression analysis, the odds that a patient aged 0 to 18
years under optimally fluoridated conditions would be
billed for dental caries treatment was 0.749, which was
25.1% less than that for a patient of the same age in the
suboptimal CWF conditions group (OR = 0.749, 95% CI
[0.623, 0.90], p < 0.002).
Lastly, our analysis for the third research objective con-
sidered which age group suffered the largest caries pro-
cedure burden under both CWF conditions. Bivariate
analysis revealed that the mean number of caries-related
procedures per patient for children under 7 years old was
significantly higher in the suboptimal CWF group than
that in the optimal CWF group (2.68 vs. 2.01, p < 0.004).
The results from binary logistic regression were also sig-
nificant (OR = 0.699, 95% CI [0.52, 0.95], p < 0.02) and
similar to previous results, indicating a protective effect
for optimal CWF exposure. Caries treatment costs were
also higher in the under 7-year-old suboptimal CWF
group than those in the optimal CWF group ($692.87 vs.
$350.13, p < 0.0001). After adjusting for inflation, we ob-
served a caries treatment cost increase of 73% attributable
to
CWF
cessation
and
estimated
at
approximately
$255.60.
The results for the group of individuals born after
CWF cessation and aged < 6 years were of particular
interest to the research team. These results are also in-
cluded in Tables 2 and 3 and Fig. 1, which summarize
the differences in the mean number of caries procedures
and treatment cost results and illustrates consistent epi-
demiologic trends. The children without exposure to op-
timal CWF suffered a higher percent increase in caries
procedures along with higher restoration costs, thus sig-
nifying greater tooth surface loss to decay secondary to
weaker enamel (2.52 vs. 1.55, p < 0.0001) ($644.72 vs.
$272.73, p < 0.0001) (Fig. 1). According to binary regres-
sion analysis for the under six-years-old age group, the
odds of undergoing dental caries procedures under opti-
mal CWF conditions was 51% less than that for a child
of the same age in 2012 under suboptimal conditions
(OR = 0.488, 95% CI [0.33, 0.73], p < 0.0001).
Discussion
The results of this study confirm the benefits of optimal
CWF supported by previous research and can contribute

 additional research-based evidence regarding the oral
health consequences and costs that can arise when CWF
is discontinued. The most common modality of study
among previous CWF cessation research was a concur-
rent cross-sectional analysis using DMFT screening in a
community that had ceased CWF at some point in the
past compared to a community that continued optimal
CWF [26]. Therefore, this research offers an alternative
modality for studying the effects of CWF using Medicaid
claims data from the same community before and after
CWF cessation.
The results demonstrate a statistically significant in-
crease in the number of dental caries procedures and as-
sociated treatment costs for the general cohort under
suboptimal CWF conditions in 2012 among patients
aged 0 to 18 years (2.35 vs. 2.02, p < 0.001). This increase
was more pronounced among younger age groups under
suboptimal CWF conditions, specifically the < 7-year-old
age group (2.68 vs. 2.01, p = 0.004) and the < 6-year-old
age group who were born after CWF was ceased (2.52
vs. 1.55, p < 0.0001).
The naturally occurring fluoride level in Juneau’s water
since CWF was ceased in January 2007 has remained be-
tween 0.05–0.065 mg/L per annual reporting, which is
more than ten-times less than the optimal CWF level
needed for caries prevention [35]. Previous research in-
dicates that without the presence of optimal levels of
fluoride in drinking water, and thus in the mouth and
saliva, teeth may form with weaker enamel and lack the
ability to remineralize early signs of decay [9, 25, 31, 48].
Therefore, we expected to observe a general increase in
dental caries-related procedures and treatment costs
across age groups because fluoride acts primarily topic-
ally [9, 48]. Additionally, we expected to observe more
significant impacts among patients with the lowest ex-
posure to optimal CWF.
In this study, a major advantage of acquiring both pre-
and post-fluoride cessation data in this natural setting
was the potential to assess the net differences in the
intervention condition (suboptimal CWF) and in the
control condition (optimal CWF) [49]. The results indi-
cate a clear caries epidemiologic shift toward a caries in-
crease among patients without the protective benefit of
optimal CWF. As no significant difference in the mean
number of caries procedures was observed between the
7- to 12- and 13- to 18-year-old age groups, we suggest
that these individuals may have a residual protective ef-
fect from optimal CWF exposure during childhood and

aService provider charges were used rather than Medicaid reimbursement amounts for comparisons by accurately adjusting for inflation
Fig. 1 Mean caries restoration costs according to age for children with optimal or suboptimal community water fluoridation (CWF). First, the mean
cost in 2003 for children with optimal CWF was calculated; the mean cost in 2003 was then adjusted for inflation (*1.25) according to the 2012 dollar
value; and lastly the increase cost attributed to suboptimal CWF was calculated

 early adolescence. Additionally, between 2003 and 2012,
we observed a sevenfold overall increase in the place-
ment of sealants. Optimal CWF exposure during child-
hood, plus the increased use of dental sealants during
school-aged years, may explain the results among the
older cohorts; however, this topic requires further inves-
tigation [27–29].
Overall, we were able to measure the influence of the
independent variable, CWF, on the dependent variables,
dental caries procedures and treatment costs, both be-
fore and after cessation by utilizing a study population
comprising participants living at or near poverty condi-
tions. The similarity of the target groups’ income criteria
for Medicaid eligibility adds strength to the internal val-
idity of the study; therefore, the results and causal impli-
cations are more valid than if the results had been
derived from the general population [22, 49]. Second,
the external validity of the results was also increased by
working with only Medicaid claims data, which limited
the influence of higher-income groups [22, 50]. Families
with high incomes may have easier access to dental care
and may more routinely visit a dentist or refill supple-
mental fluoride tablets, which could potentially dilute
small changes in caries rates under fluoridation and
non-fluoridation conditions [22, 24, 27, 50]. Therefore,
the results are likely generalizable to other Medicaid
groups in communities considering CWF cessation.
Regarding reliability, variations in providers’ thera-
peutic approaches and billing practices may have had
some influence, but we anticipate that these variations
were similar in both study years. The data were managed
and recoded by only two individuals, and errors were es-
timated to be minimal. In summary, the internal and ex-
ternal qualities of this study support generalizability to
other 0- to 18-year-old Medicaid populations in Alaska
who have already ceased CWF or are considering CWF
cessation. The methodology and analysis processes are
certainly transferrable to other regions and offer an in-
novative metric option for future oral health research
and statewide public health surveillance programs.
The results presented in Table 3 indicate a progres-
sively higher caries risk and cost burden for the younger
age groups in the suboptimal CWF cohort. Please recall
that older patients in this study were exposed to several
years of optimal CWF as young children born prior to
cessation in 2007. For example, patients in the 7- to
13-year-old age group were born between 2000 and
2005 and thus benefited from early-life/childhood opti-
mal CWF exposure. Overall, the costs of caries treat-
ment services increased for each age group cohort, even
after adjusting for inflation, and were markedly higher
under
suboptimal
CWF
conditions.
These
results
support current evidence that even in modern condi-
tions with widely available fluoride toothpaste, rinses,
and professionally applied prophylaxis, CWF is associ-
ated with population benefits, including cost effective-
ness and caries prevention [6, 7, 22, 24, 31, 50, 51].
Limitations
The study has a number of limitations. First, due to
funding limits, only two years of data were purchased
for comparison rather than five to ten years of data,
which would have enabled a more sophisticated trend
analysis.
Second,
dental
claims
for
extractions
or
full-mouth reconstruction were removed from the pri-
mary data analysis because we could not confirm that
these procedures were caries-related without the clients’
full medical records. Therefore, caries procedures and
costs may be underrepresented in the results. Third, the
coding scheme also assumes that within 1 year, the den-
tal professional treated all points of decay for each indi-
vidual patient and did not over- or undertreat. Lastly, if
an eligible child did not visit the dentist that year, then
no claims forms were generated, and they were not in-
cluded in the study.
While the use of reimbursement claims records as the
primary metric for longitudinal evaluation in a pre- and
post-CWF-exposed population was innovative, a prece-
dent had been set by concurrent comparison population
analyses completed in Louisiana [16] and New York [22]
and by the Texas Department of Public Health [23].
Additional methodological factors include identification
of strategies to control for confounders and the issue of
measuring
short-term
versus
long-term
changes.
Rugg-Gunn and Do [40] remark that among studies
published in the last twenty-five years exploring CWF
using a cross-sectional comparison methodology, the use
of multivariate statistical analyses with adjustments for
confounders has yielded minimal change in the net ef-
fect of CWF on caries reduction. Typical covariates for
dental caries and dozens of other negative health out-
comes include diet, parental education and parental in-
come [40]. As with most negative health outcomes,
these covariates can play roles in determining an individ-
ual’s oral health, often influencing diet options, social
norms
toward
seeking
preventative
dental
care,
prioritization of home oral care practices and stress
levels [24, 28]. We acknowledge baseline and compari-
son data regarding parental education among low in-
come families, home oral hygiene practices, and dietary
habits to be unknown considerations. However, proxy
measures may offer some estimates of influence. For ex-
ample, the Alaska Youth Risk Behavioral Survey (YRBS)
tracks sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption
among teens, which appears to be declining, mirroring
national trends. According to the YRBS for Alaska in
2007, 21.8% of youths drank one SSB one or more times
per day during the past 7 days, while in 2013, the rate
Meyer et al. BMC Oral Health          (2018) 18:215 
Page 7 of 10
 was 15.8% [52, 53]. While the trend of reduced SSB and
thus added sugar consumption may be declining nation-
ally and statewide, the reduction is highly unlikely to be
sufficient to result in a reduction in caries (< 10% of total
daily calories) [54, 55].
Based on available population estimates, we note only
small changes between the 2003 and 2012 Juneau Bor-
ough censuses and minimal changes to Medicaid eligibil-
ity
requirements.
Therefore,
common
sense
would
support
that
the
parental
education
level
among
Medicaid-eligible families was also comparable between
the two groups. While the similarities in population size
and socioeconomic conditions may strengthen the valid-
ity of the study conclusions, they can also be viewed as a
limitation for the generalizability of the study’s results to
other populations that experience more in-and-out mi-
gration or wider variations in income.
Other covariates that may have influenced the results
include prescriptive fluoride supplementation, school
fluoride rinse programs, and dental sealants. No school-
based oral health or school rinse programs existed in Ju-
neau before, during or after the study period, and pre-
scriptive supplementation has always remained very
limited (personal communications with Dr. Whistler and
Dr. Hort, January 2016). Notably, among studies explor-
ing other probable confounders, such as widely available
fluoride toothpaste, moderate access to school-based
fluoride varnish programs and in-office fluoride applica-
tions, researchers have reported that optimal CWF still
improves oral health among children through caries
prevention, enamel remineralization and cost savings
[22, 28, 31, 50, 51, 56, 57]. Lastly, another potential limi-
tation of this study is that we do not have information
regarding fluoride toothpaste use in this low-socioeco-
nomic status population, and fluoride toothpaste use
may be much lower than that expected in other popula-
tions. Such information could strengthen the conclusion
regarding the benefit of CWF in this population com-
pared to other populations that regularly use fluoride
toothpaste.
Conclusion
This study analyzed oral health changes secondary to
CWF discontinuation among Medicaid-eligible children
and adolescents in a community in which the local gov-
ernment ceased fluoridation of the public water system.
We examined the relationship between dental caries-re-
lated procedures and costs under optimal and subopti-
mal CWF conditions through rigorous statistical analysis
of Medicaid dental claims records and formed the fol-
lowing conclusions. According to the aforementioned re-
sults, CWF cessation promoted a marked increase in the
number of caries-related procedures and treatment costs
for Medicaid-eligible children and adolescents aged 0–
18 years. Additionally, the results indicated that children
in the younger age group cohorts underwent more den-
tal caries procedures than the older age group cohorts,
who had benefited from early childhood exposure to op-
timal CWF. These results add to the growing body of in-
formation
available
regarding
CWF
cessation
epidemiology by both confirming the dental caries pre-
vention benefit of CWF and expanding the evidence
base regarding the oral health impacts of CWF cessation
under contemporary conditions.
The analysis also can offer fiscal estimates that can be
used by community leaders and decision-makers who
are considering CWF cessation and may need to plan
for the increased revenue required to address the treat-
ment costs among clients relying on state and federal
government subsidies. With this study, dental and pub-
lic health professionals also have access to more evi-
dence to accurately inform officials establishing future
community water fluoridation policies and to illustrate
how CWF cessation can affect individuals, especially
children, in economically vulnerable or low-income cir-
cumstances [22, 24, 28, 50].
