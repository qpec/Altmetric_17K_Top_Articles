AIMS
Polypharmacy is increasingly common in older adults, placing them at risk of medication-related harm (MRH). Patients are par-
ticularly vulnerable to problems with their medications in the period following hospital discharge due to medication changes and
poor information transfer between hospital and primary care. The aim of the present study was to investigate the incidence, se-
verity, preventability and cost of MRH in older adults in England postdischarge.
METHODS
An observational, multicentre, prospective cohort study recruited 1280 older adults (median age 82 years) from five teaching
hospitals in Southern England, UK. Participants were followed up for 8 weeks by senior pharmacists, using three data sources
(hospital readmission review, participant telephone interview and primary care records), to identify MRH and associated health
service utilization.

 RESULTS
Overall, 413 participants (37%) experienced MRH (556 MRH events per 1000 discharges), of which 336 (81%) cases were serious
and 214 (52%) potentially preventable. Four participants experienced fatal MRH. The most common MRH events were
gastrointestinal (n = 158, 25%) or neurological (n = 111, 18%). The medicine classes associated with the highest risk of MRH were
opiates, antibiotics and benzodiazepines. A total of 328 (79%) participants with MRH sought healthcare over the 8-week follow-
up. The incidence of MRH-associated hospital readmission was 78 per 1000 discharges. Postdischarge MRH in older adults is
estimated to cost the National Health Service £396 million annually, of which £243 million is potentially preventable.
CONCLUSIONS
MRH is common in older adults following hospital discharge, and results in substantial use of healthcare resources.
WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT
• Polypharmacy is increasingly common in older adults in the UK.
• Older adults are vulnerable to medication-related problems during transitions of care from hospital into the community.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
• Medication-related harm affects one in three older adults following hospital discharge, of which at least 10% is
preventable.
• Non-adherence is implicated in one quarter of cases of medication harm.
• The cost to the NHS of postdischarge medication harm in older adults is estimated at £396 million, of which over 90% is
attributable to hospital readmissions.
Introduction
Harm from medicines is a common cause of preventable
morbidity and mortality in patients worldwide [1]. The
European Medicines Agency describes adverse drug reac-
tions (ADRs) as ‘a response to a medicinal product that is
noxious and unintended’ [2]. In England, between 2008
and 2015, emergency hospital admissions due to ADRs in-
creased by 53%, from 60 055 to 92 114 [3]. Based on data
from a major UK study conducted in 2002 [4], the National
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) estimated
an annual cost to the National Health Service (NHS) in
2015 of £530 million from preventable ADR-related hospi-
tal admissions [5].
Older people are highly susceptible to harm from medi-
cines, due to polypharmacy and ageing-related changes in
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics [6, 7]. Further-
more, non-adherence to medicines for chronic disease was
found in 30% of participants (median age 67 years) in one
UK study [8]. Non-adherence to medicine is strongly associ-
ated with poor health outcomes [9], including mortality
[10], and high healthcare costs [11]. A systematic review
found that 16% of community-dwelling older adults experi-
ence harm from their medicines at any one time, compared
with 5% of younger adults [12].
The transition period from hospital to home following
hospital discharge has rarely been explored, despite the vul-
nerability of patients to medication problems during this pe-
riod. For instance, patients often experience medication
changes [13] with limited involvement in these decisions
[14]. Provision of information about possible side effects can
be poor [15], and communication is often lacking between
secondary and primary care [16]. Furthermore, this is a time
of heightened physiological stress for patients, due to the
lingering impact of acute illness and deconditioning from
their hospital stay [17].
In England, medication-related harm (MRH) in the
postdischarge period has not been studied in an older popula-
tion. The aims of the present study were: (i) to determine the
incidence, severity and preventability of MRH postdischarge
in older adults; (ii) to describe the main types of MRH and im-
plicated drugs; (iii) to describe health service utilization and
cost associated with MRH.
Methods
The study was approved by the National Research Ethics Ser-
vice, East of England (REC Reference 13/EE/0075).
Design, setting and participants
Detailed methods for the study have been published previ-
ously [18]. In brief, this multicentre, prospective cohort
study recruited adults aged 65 years and over. Between Sep-
tember 2013 and November 2015, research nurses invited
patients to participate from medical wards in five NHS
teaching hospitals in Southern England, near to the time
of hospital discharge. The nurses collected baseline informa-
tion, including demographic, clinical and social data, from
consenting patients. Senior, trained research pharmacists
followed discharged participants for 8 weeks to determine
if they experienced MRH. An 8-week observation period
was chosen as previous research outside of the UK has
shown that this is a reasonable time frame for capturing
most postdischarge MRH events [19–21]. We excluded pa-
tients if they were terminally ill, lacked capacity and had

 no nominated consultee, or were transferred to other acute
healthcare units.
MRH assessment
We defined MRH as an ADR or harm arising from a failure to
receive medication owing to non-adherence. Harm arising
from medication error was included where reported. Inten-
tional overdose was excluded. This is a modified version of
the definition by Strand et al. [22]. A medicine was defined
by
its
inclusion
in
the
World
Health
Organization–
Anatomical Therapeutics Coding (WHO-ATC) system [23].
We determined MRH incidence using three sources of
follow-up information: (i) participant and/or carer telephone
interview at 8 weeks, using a structured questionnaire; (ii)
general practitioner (GP) records; and (iii) prospective review
of hospital readmissions, in consultation with the admitting
medical consultant.
If an ADR was suspected, the validated Naranjo algo-
rithm [24] was used to assess causality, in conjunction with
the British National Formulary and Summary of Product
Characteristics. For MRH associated with non-adherence to
medicine, we used a modified version of a validated question-
naire to assess participant non-adherence [25]. We classified
events as ‘possible’, ‘probable’ or ‘definite’ MRH, or ‘doubtful’
when no harm occurred [26–28]. We graded severity of
MRH using the approach of Morimoto et al. [29]: fatal, life-
threatening,
serious
(requires
therapy
change
and/or
treatment by a health professional) and significant. The
preventability of MRH was assessed using the criteria of
Hallas et al. [30]: ‘definitely preventable’ (treatment inconsis-
tent with best practice or unrealistic), ‘possibly preventable’
(preventable
with
efforts
exceeding
obligatory
clinical
demands), ‘not preventable’, or ‘not able to evaluate’. Two
senior study pharmacists provided case-based training to
research pharmacists involved in data collection at all partic-
ipating sites, to optimize the reliability of MRH assessments.
Additionally, cross-site case discussions were held regularly
between the research pharmacists to ensure the standardiza-
tion of MRH assessments.
An end-point committee independent from data collec-
tion, consisting of three senior geriatricians and a senior re-
searcher
in
clinical
pharmacy,
was
provided
with
the
structured case summaries of all cases of MRH by the research
pharmacists. The role of the committee was to review, scruti-
nize and finally confirm or reject cases of MRH by consensus.
Implicated medicines were classified according to the World
Health
Organization–Anatomical
Therapeutic
Chemical
(WHO-ATC) classification system.
Healthcare utilization and cost analysis
The three sources of data collected (participant interviews,
GP records, hospital readmissions) provided information on
NHS use over the 8-week follow-up (including emergency de-
partment visits, hospital admission, outpatient clinics, GP
visits and out-of-hours care). The date and reason for consul-
tation were used to determine NHS utilization associated with
MRH.
We used the Department of Health’s 2013/14 payment by
results NHS tariff data to cost episodes of healthcare utiliza-
tion by linking them to Healthcare Resource Groups (HRGs)
[31]. When in doubt, we took the most cautious approach,
such as for emergency department visits and out-of-hours
care.1
To estimate the annual cost in England of postdischarge
MRH in older adults, we multiplied the average excess cost re-
lated to MRH per discharged participant in our study by the
estimated number of unplanned admissions of older people
in 2013/14 in England [33].Furthermore, we disaggregated
the costs of MRH-associated healthcare use by preventability.
Statistical analysis
We examined variable distributions for normality and com-
pared the characteristics of the cohort included in the final
analysis with those of patients lost to follow-up, using the
Mann–Whitney U-test. Fisher’s exact test was used to com-
pare categorical variables.
The incidence of MRH is reported as: (i) the incidence pro-
portion (number of participants experiencing MRH/total
sample) and (ii) the incidence of events per 1000 discharged
participants (number of events × 1000/total sample). Other
descriptive statistics are based on frequency calculations. In-
cidence proportions are presented with accompanying 95%
confidence intervals. We analysed data using IBM SPSS Statis-
tics, version 22 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).
Results
Participant characteristics
The study recruited 1280 older adults at hospital discharge
and followed up participants for 8 weeks. Research pharma-
cists completed a telephone interview with 873 participants
(68.2%) and retrieved the GP records of 922 participants
(72.0%). From the 1280 recruited participants, 17 (1.3%) died
without follow-up, and 147 participants (11.5%) were lost to
follow-up because they were not readmitted, their GP records
were unavailable or they could not be contacted. Therefore,
our final cohort included 1116 (87.2%) participants (see
Table 1).
The median age of the cohort was 82 years [interquartile
range (IQR) 76–87], 58% were female and the median number
of discharge medicines was nine (IQR 7–12).
Incidence of MRH
Overall, 413 participants [37.0% (95% CI 34.2–39.9%)]
experienced MRH in the 8-week follow-up period, with 856
medicines implicated in 621 events. This represents an MRH
incidence of 556 events per 1000 participants over an 8-week
time
frame.
A
total
of
460
MRH
events
(74%)
were
attributable to medicines prescribed at hospital discharge,
with the remainder prescribed in the community during the
1With no investigations and no treatment in the emergency de-
partment, costing £58 per episode [31]. Out-of-hours medical
visits associated with MRH were costed at £53.60 using data from
the National Audit Office [32], which reports that 50% of visits
cost £53.60 to £86.30. This cautious approach avoided false as-
sumptions about the extent of investigation and treatment.

 8-week observation period. Of the 413 participants whom we
classified as having MRH, 246 (60%) experienced at least
one MRH event considered ‘probable’ (n = 110) or ‘definite’
(n = 136). The remaining cases were ‘possible’ (n = 167).
The
prevalence
of
non-adherence
in
our
cohort
was
29.1% at follow-up (325 out of 1112 participants with
adherence data).
ADRs were solely responsible for MRH in 301 out of
413 cases (72.9%), non-adherence in 45 cases (10.9%) and
a
medication
error
in
14
cases
(3.4%).
In
five
cases
(1.2%), the patient experienced harm from both an ADR
and a medication error. The underlying medication error
was at the stage of prescribing in 11 cases, dispensing in
four cases, administration by a carer in three cases and pa-
tient error in the use of a medicine administration device
in one case. In 48 cases (11.6%), harm was due to both
an ADR and non-adherence. For example, a participant
who experienced a gastric bleed associated with antiplatelet
therapy was non-adherent to their proton-pump inhibitor.
One quarter of ADRs occurred in the first week postdis-
charge, and 68% within 30 days of discharge.
Severity and preventability of MRH
Four participants (1.0%) experienced a fatal event associated
with the MRH; one died following a fall and fractured neck
of femur associated with lorazepam use, one from a major gas-
trointestinal bleed associated with use of apixaban, one from
a stroke associated with non-adherence to warfarin and one
from a lower respiratory tract infection associated with
prednisolone-induced
immunosuppression.
Nine
partici-
pants (2.2%) had a life-threatening event, and MRH was seri-
ous in a further 323 participants (78.2%). We classified
medication harm as ‘definitely’ preventable in 44 cases

Types of MRH and implicated medicines
The body systems affected by MRH are shown in Table 2. The
main body systems affected by MRH were gastrointestinal
(25.4%) or neurological (17.9%). The most common events
were diarrhoea (n = 55; 8.9%), constipation (n = 52; 8.4%),
falls (n = 35; 5.6%) and bleeding (n = 31; 5.0%).
Antihypertensives and opiates were implicated in the
highest proportion of MRH events (22.4% and 17.2%, re-
spectively). However, MRH risk (incidence per 1000 pre-
scriptions) was greatest for opiates (399), followed by
antibiotics (189). The risk of MRH by medicine class is
shown in Table 3.

experienced
105
MRH
events,

their
adverse
event(s)
without

input.
The
most
common events were diarrhoea (n = 13; 12.4%), constipa-
tion (n = 11; 10.5%), dizziness (n = 8; 7.6%) and peripheral
oedema (n = 8; 7.6%).
Health service utilization and cost
Out of the 413 MRH cases, 328 [95% CI (75.2–83.2%)] had at
least one NHS service use associated with MRH, and 87 partic-
ipants [95% CI (6.3–9.5%)] had an MRH-associated hospital
readmission. A total of 328 participants received 441 NHS
consults [GP consultation (n = 316; 71.7%), hospital readmis-
sion (n = 96; 21.8%], outpatient clinic attendance (n = 12;
2.7%], emergency department attendance (n = 9; 2.0%), out-
of-hours visit (n = 8; 1.8%)]. The cumulative NHS cost, over
the 8-week period after hospital discharge, was £225 747, an
average cost per participant with MRH of £546.60. Hospital
readmissions accounted for 93% of total costs. The estimated
annual cost to the NHS of MRH postdischarge in older adults
is £395.5 million. The cost of preventable MRH lies between

Discussion
This was the first UK study to investigate medication harm in
older adults following hospital discharge. Our key findings
were that MRH affects one in three older adults, and that
80% of cases were serious, and at least 10% preventable. Four
out of five participants with MRH consulted an NHS service
within
8
weeks
postdischarge.
We
estimated
that
postdischarge MRH to the older population incurs an annual
cost in the region of £400 million to the NHS, and that most
of this cost is attributable to hospital readmissions.
ADRs are the main form of MRH, and 25% manifest in
the first week postdischarge. A large proportion of older
adults (29%) are non-adherent in the postdischarge period,
and the present study clearly demonstrated the harms asso-
ciated with this; non-adherence was implicated in 23% of
MRH cases, including one death. While the study did not
seek to identify medication errors, harm attributable to a
medication error was recorded and represented a very small
proportion of the overall MRH burden (<5%). In the major-
ity of these cases, the medication error was made at the
prescribing stage.
Strengths and limitations
The main strengths of the study were the comprehensive data
collection (participant interview, primary care records and re-
admission review) and the fact that we recruited a large,
multicentre cohort of older adults (average age >80 years).
Our definition of MRH reflects ‘real-life’ for patients by in-
cluding harm from non-adherence (as opposed to only
ADRs), and, we employed a robust approach to ascribe MRH
causality using a validated algorithm [24] and the clinical ex-
pertise of senior pharmacists and geriatricians.
However, there were also several limitations. Participants’
involvement in the study might have heightened their
awareness of potential ADRs. They might therefore have been
more attentive to medicines-related information and usage
instructions, or more likely to seek healthcare when MRH
was suspected. However, this increased knowledge might also
have enabled participants to attribute and report MRH more
accurately.
Retrospective participant interviews may have resulted
in under-reporting of MRH due to poor recall, and GPs
may not have recorded all MRH encountered owing to time
pressures or a perceived lack of severity [34]. Harm arising
from medication errors might have been underestimated
as we did not look actively for postdischarge medication
reconciliation errors and assess their impact. It is possible,
therefore, that some MRH was misclassified as an ADR,
rather than a harm due to medication error. Nonetheless,
a very small proportion of medication errors actually lead
to patient harm [35].
The NHS costs we report are an approximation based on
the incidence and types of MRH in the present study. We re-
corded NHS utilization associated with MRH, and could not
infer causality. Nonetheless, hospital readmissions accounted
for 93% of overall cost, and in these cases the MRH was veri-
fied as a principal driver for admission by the medical consul-
tant in charge.

 Comparison with other studies
The proportion of participants experiencing MRH (37%) in
our study was higher than previously reported [36]. This
was probably due to methodological differences as opposed
to any peculiarities in our study population or the healthcare
system. A retrospective analysis of 1000 older patients in the
United States found that 18.7% experienced MRH over a
45-day period following hospital discharge [21]. This study
identified events through review of medical notes, contrasting
with our prospective methods, which additionally included
participant interviews. Retrospective studies and studies that
exclude participant interviews tend to report a lower incidence
of MRH [12, 37]. A prospective European study of 209 patients
(average age 74 years) found that 30% of their cohort experi-
enced an ADR over a 30-day postdischarge period [38]. This
finding was comparable to our results, although our slightly
higher incidence of 37% probably reflected the inclusion of
MRH from non-adherence.
We found that 11% of participants experiencing MRH had
an event that was definitely preventable. Nevertheless, we be-
lieve that the true proportion is likely to be higher as 41% of
MRH cases were possibly preventable. A systematic review
published in 2011 by Taché et al. reported that 16.5% of
MRH events in the community were preventable, based on
all age groups [12]. The high proportion of preventable events
in our study reflected the particularly challenging period (i.e.
postdischarge) we investigated in an older population, and
our inclusion of harm from non-adherence to medicines.
The systematic review by Taché et al. [12] found cardio-
vascular medicines to be most implicated in MRH in the com-
munity setting, reflecting the high prevalence of their use.
Our study found that 22% of MRH was associated with anti-
hypertensive medicines. However, the highest risk of MRH
was associated with opiates. Concerns have been raised about
the potential harm related to overuse of opiates in noncancer
patients in the UK [39], and our study demonstrated the ac-
tual harm associated with opiate use in older adults.
Implications for practitioners and policy makers
Given the high proportion of preventable MRH in our study,
there is considerable scope for improving patient safety. The
lack of prescriber knowledge of harms is a key driver of med-
icines overuse [40], and, clinicians are more likely to overesti-
mate the benefits of treatment and underestimate the harms
[41]. The present study highlights the extent of MRH during
a critical juncture of healthcare provision, and supports
the need for increased pharmacovigilance among clinicians
in secondary and primary care. While most MRH in the
postdischarge period was attributable to medicines prescribed
in the hospital setting, one-quarter of implicated medicines
were prescribed in the community. It is crucial to reconcile
the medicines that patients receive on discharge from hospi-
tal, with those already listed on the repeat prescription from
the GP, and any additional medicines which the patient takes
at home. Prescribers in the community must be wary of the
heightened vulnerability of patients to harm in the immedi-
ate postdischarge period, as physiological systems remain im-
paired during recovery from acute illness and the stressors
associated with hospitalization (e.g. poor nourishment,
deconditioning, sleep disturbance, delirium) [17].
There are numerous lists of potentially inappropriate
medicines for older adults [42] [e.g. Screening Tool of
Older
Persons’
Potentially
inappropriate
Prescriptions
(STOPP), Beers, (European Union Potentially Inappropriate
Medications (EU-PIM)]. While these have merit, a ‘hard and
fast’
rules-based
approach
does
not
account
for
the
biopsychosocial complexity of patients [43, 44]. Simple guid-
ing principles that support clinical judgement for the safe initi-
ation of medicine [e.g. the BEGIN (1. Basis for therapy; 2.
Evaluate risk of interactions; 3. Given agreement; 4. Intended
benefit likely; 5. No better alternative) algorithm [45] or the
Medication Appropriateness Index [46]] may be more practical
and effective [47]. When prescribers initiate new medicines, a
tentative stop or review date should always be specified. While
it remains unclear from randomized trials if medication
review on its own reduces MRH in older adults, multicompo-
nent interventions incorporating patient education have
demonstrated success during transitions of care [13, 48].
In addition, there are several risk prediction tools to iden-
tify patients at high risk for MRH, although these have been
largely developed for a hospitalized population [49]. In the
present study, we showed that the risk of MRH is highest in
the community setting following hospital discharge. Future
work should focus on developing a tool to identify high-risk
patients during this particularly vulnerable period.
Our national cost estimate of almost £400 million per year
is a conservative estimate. It excludes the indirect costs from
wasted medicines (non-adherence and poor therapeutic
value, or medicines that must be stopped owing to adverse ef-
fects) and the social costs of additional formal and informal
care (e.g. time taken away from work by relatives to support
participants). The bulk of the cost arises from hospital
readmissions. Therefore, early recognition of medication-
related problems and community management as far as pos-
sible could generate large savings.
In conclusion, medication harm in older adults is a com-
mon and costly phenomenon following hospital discharge.
Increased vigilance to high-risk prescribing, and supporting
the appropriate use of medicines in the community, might re-
duce this problem.

Appendix 1
Case examples of medication-related harm (MRH)
Case 1: Adverse drug reactions
Likelihood MRH: definite; severity: serious; preventable: definitely
Past history of MI, severe aortic stenosis, angina, COPD, diabetes.
Participant sitting in chair and began to shake, and with central chest
pain and shortness of breath. Felt dizzy with pain, and thought she was
going to collapse. Readmitted 15 days postdischarge with negative
troponin. Participant experienced a similar presyncopal episode after
morning medicines as inpatient, with BP dropping to 76/35 mmHg.
Impression: participant suffered a hypotensive episode secondary to a
combination of medicines which lower blood pressure: losartan, ISMN,
nicorandil and diltiazem.
Case 2: Medication error
Likelihood MRH: definite; severity: serious; preventable: definitely
Past history of heart failure, COPD and dementia. Participant
experienced increased shortness of breath and bilateral leg swelling.
Discharged 7 days previously with increased bumetanide dose. At home,
carer administered medicines from old dosette box containing lower
dose of bumetanide. Symptoms responded well to increased diuretics.
Impression: exacerbation of heart failure due to administration of
incorrect bumetanide dose.
Case 3: Adverse drug reaction and non-adherence
Likelihood MRH: definite; severity: serious; preventable: possibly
Past history of AF, diabetes, PVD, reduced mobility, grade 3 pressure
sore. Daughter requested GP visit for participant 6 days post-discharge.
Participant experienced nausea and constipation. No urinary symptoms,
negative MSU. Had been prescribed buprenorphine patch and
dihydrocodeine from hospital following fractured neck of femur. Has
laxido but does not take it. Impression: constipation secondary to
opioids and non-adherence to laxatives.
AF, atrial fibrillation; BP, blood pressure; COPD: chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease; GP, general practitioner; ISMN, isosorbide
mononitrate; MI, myocardial infarction; MSU, midstream urine;
PVD, peripheral vascular disease
