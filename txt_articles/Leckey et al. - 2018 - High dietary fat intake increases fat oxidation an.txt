ABSTRACT: High-fat, low-carbohydrate (CHO) diets increase whole-body rates of fat oxidation and down-regulate
CHO metabolism. We measured substrate utilization and skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration to determine
whether these adaptations are driven by high fat or low CHO availability. In a randomized crossover design, 8 male
cyclistsconsumed5dofahigh-CHO diet[>70%energyintake(EI)],followedby5dofeitheranisoenergetichigh-fat
(HFAT; >65% EI) or high-protein diet (HPRO; >65% EI) with CHO intake clamped at <20% EI. During the in-
tervention, participants undertook daily exercise training. On d 6, participants consumed a high-CHO diet before
performing 100 min of submaximal steady-state cycling plus an ∼30-min time trial. After 5 d of HFAT, skeletal
muscle mitochondrial respiration supported by octanoylcarnitine and pyruvate, as well as uncoupled respiration,
was decreased at rest, and rates of whole-body fat oxidation were higher during exercise compared with HPRO.
After 1 d of high-CHO diet intake, mitochondrial respiration returned to baseline values in HFAT, whereas rates of
substrate oxidation returned toward baseline in both conditions. These findings demonstrate that high dietary fat
intake, rather than low-CHO intake, contributes to reductions in mitochondrial respiration and increases in whole-
body rates of fat oxidation after a consuming a high-fat, low-CHO diet.—Leckey, J. J., Hoffman, N. J., Parr, E. B.,

As a result of their efficacy for improving both metabolic
health profiles (1) and athletic performance (2, 3), high-fat,
low-carbohydrate (CHO) diets have increased in popu-
larity during the past 2 decades. Short-term (1–3 wk) in-
gestion of a high-fat, low-CHO diet compared with an
isoenergetic high-CHO diet for the same duration in-
creases rates of whole-body and muscle fat utilization and
decreases the rate of muscle glycogenolysis during sub-
maximal exercise (2, 4–6). Such metabolic perturbations
are robust and persist in the face of high CHO availability
from both endogenous and exogenous sources (4, 7, 8).
Impaired glycogenolysis as a consequence of high-fat,
low-CHO diets has been explained by decreased pyruvate
dehydrogenase (PDH) activation (5), which suggests im-
paired metabolic flexibility in skeletal muscle. A range of
alterations in the activities of regulatory enzymes and/or
signaling proteins in the pathways that underlie skeletal
muscle fat and CHO metabolism are likely to explain the

(HFAT); however, to date, it has not been possible to de-
terminewhethersuchadaptationsaredrivenbyhighfator
low CHO availability, as the protocols used in previous
studies involved changes to both macronutrients simul-
taneously (2, 4,5, 7). Therefore, to elucidate the underlying
mechanisms that drive changes in metabolic flexibility,
high-fat dietary intake must be compared with an iso-
energetic diet during which CHO intake is clamped in
both dietary interventions. Few studies have determined
changes to skeletal muscle in well-trained humans after an
HFAT, and, to date, no study has assessed mitochondrial
respiration in this population to determine whether this
could explain changes in metabolic flexibility.
Therefore, the current investigation aimed to determine
whether the metabolic perturbations induced by HFAT are
a result of high fat or low CHO availability. Well-trained
humans were fed 5 d of either an HFAT or an isoenergetic
high-protein diet [HPRO; ;65% energy intake (EI)], with
CHO intake clamped to ,20% of total daily EI (2.6 g/kg
body mass). We utilized whole-body expired gas measures,
together with an assessment of skeletal muscle substrates,
mitochondrial respiration, and signaling proteins with pu-
tative roles in substrate metabolism in an effort to identify
mechanisms that underlie changes in the patterns of sub-
strate oxidation observed after HFAT. We hypothesized

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethical approval
This study conformed to the standards set by the Declaration of
Helsinki and was approved by the Human Research Ethics
Committee of Australian Catholic University and registered
with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry
(ACTRN12616000433404). Participants completed a medical
history questionnaire to ensure they were free from illness and
injury before commencing the study, and were informed of all
experimental procedures and possible risks before providing
their written informed consent.
Overview of study design
Eight well-trained male cyclists with a history of endurance
training and riding .200 km/wk were recruited for this study.
Participantcharacteristicswereasfollows:age,2564(SD)yr;body
mass (BM), 77.3 6 7.0 kg; VO2peak (peak O2 uptake), 64.0 6 3.5 ml/
kg/min; and peak power output (PPO), 380 6 36 W. An overview
of the study design is shown in Fig. 1. Each participant completed
2 experimental conditions in a block randomized, crossover de-
sign while undertaking supervized training. There was an
;14 d washout period between conditions. It was not possible to
blind participants to the dietary interventions; however, the
principal researchers who completed data collection and perfor-
mance measures were blinded to the order of experimental trials.
Preliminary testing
Each participant completed an incremental test to volitional fa-
tigueonanelectronicallybrakedcycleergometer(LodeExcalibur
Sport, Groningen, The Netherlands) to determine VO2peak and
PPO (9). During the maximal test and all subsequent experi-
mental trials,expired gas was collected every 30 s via open-circuit
spirometry (TrueOne 2400; Parvo Medics, Sandy, UT, USA) and
instantaneous rates of O2 consumption (VO2) and CO2 pro-
duction (VCO2) were used to calculate the respiratory exchange
ratio (RER). Before each test, gas analyzers were calibrated with
commercially available gases (16% O2, 4% CO2), and volume
flow was calibrated by using a 3-L syringe. An individual’s
VO2peak was determined as the highest 30-s average. These data
were used to calculate the work rate that corresponded to 63 and
80% of PPO for the 2 experimental rides.
Experimental trials
Participants followed a controlled high-CHO diet [72% EI; 10 g/
kg BM (high-CHO diet)] for 5 d before an experimental trial
(Table 1). Participants reported to the laboratory on the fifth day
after an overnight fast and a resting blood sample (6 ml) was
collected from an antecubital vein. Participants were then pro-
vided a standardized breakfast (2 g/kg BM CHO). After break-
fast (2 h), participants were weighed and a second blood sample
was collected before they completed a 20-min continuous ride at
63%PPO.Expiredgasandmeasuresofheartrate(HR)andrateof
perceivedexertion(RPE)werecollectedduringthelast5minofthe
ride (10). Water was consumed ad libitum, and, upon completion
of the ride, a third blood sample was collected before participants
left the laboratory for the final (fifth) day of the high-CHO diet.

 The next morning, participants reported to the laboratory
after an overnight fast, and a cannula (22 G; Terumo, Tokyo,
Japan) was inserted into an antecubital vein and a resting blood
sample (6 ml) was collected. A resting muscle biopsy was then
taken from the vastus lateralis by using the percutaneous biopsy
technique with suction applied (11). Participants then repeated
the 20-min continuous ride at 63% PPO in the fasting state before
commencing a high-intensity interval training session (8 3 5 min
at 80% PPO), as previously described (12). The purpose of this
interval session was to reduce muscle glycogen stores in both
conditions before the dietary intervention.
Diet and training intervention
Participantscommenced5dofeitherHFATorHPRO.HFATand
HPRO diets consisted of ;67% EI from fat or protein and 19% EI
from CHO (Table 1). Protein was provided as an alternative
macronutrient to meet energy requirements and CHO was
clamped. Total EI was 0.22 MJ/kg BM. HFAT diet consisted
of ;55% saturated and 45% unsaturated, mono- and poly-
unsaturated, fats. Fiber intake was matched for both diets. All
meals, snacks, and energy-containing fluids were provided to
participants in previously prepared packages, with diets in-
dividualized for food preference. Participants completed a daily
food checklist to maximize compliance and recorded all fluid
(water) consumed on a daily basis during both trials. Caffeine
ingestion was not permitted 24 h before an experimental trial,
and participants refrained from alcohol during the intervention
period. During this time, participants followed a prescribed
training program, as described previously (2), that closely
matched each individual’s habitual road cycle training volume.
Training was matched for each experimental treatment, and
participants were instructed to ride at an RPE that corresponded
to 11–13 (10) during each on-road session. Participants reported
to the laboratory on d 4 and completed the same high-intensity
interval training session as on d 1. On the morning of d 6, par-
ticipants reportedtothelaboratoryina fastingstate,anda resting
blood sample (6 ml) and muscle biopsy were collected before
they completed a 20-min ride at 63% PPO. Participants were
then provided with 1 d of a high-CHO diet (10 g/kg BM CHO;
Table 1).
Performance ride
After an overnight fast, participants reported to the laboratory to
complete a performance ride that consisted of 100 min of steady-
state (100SS) cycling at 63% PPO, followed by a 7 kJ/kg BM time
trial (TT). Upon arrival at the laboratory, a cannula was inserted
into an antecubital vein, and a fasting blood sample (10 ml) was
collected. A muscle biopsy was taken 2–3 cm distal from the
previous incision. Participants then consumed breakfast (2 g/kg
BM CHO) and rested for 120 min. Immediately before exercise,
participants were weighed, and a second blood sample was
collected.Duringexercise,bloodsamples(10ml)andmeasuresof
RPE and HR were collected every 20 min, with expired gas col-
lected at 15, 35, 55, 75, and 95 min. Participants were provided
with CHO in the form of isotonic gels (SiS GO Isotonic Gel; Sci-
ence In Sport, Blackburn, United Kingdom) and a 6% CHO so-
lution (933 ml fluid, 2 gels total) every 20 min throughout the ride
at a rate of 60 g/h, and water was consumed ad libitum during
each trial. Immediately upon completion of the 100SS ride, an
additional muscle biopsy was taken. Participants then voided
their bladder and had a 3-min rest before commencing the TT.
Participants were instructed to complete the TT as fast as possi-
ble, with visual feedback of cadence and verbal feedback of
elapsed work as a percentage of the total work (every 10%).
Participants were only provided the results of their TT

 performance upon study completion. Blood samples were
collected immediately before and after the TT.
Rates of substrate oxidation and total
energy expenditure
Whole-body rates of CHO and fat oxidation (g/min) were cal-
culated from respiratory gas samples that were collected during
rides by using nonprotein RER equations (13), which are based
on the assumption that VO2 and VCO2 accurately reflect tissue O2
consumption and CO2 production:
CHO oxidation ðg=minÞ ¼ 4:585 VCO2ðL=minÞ
2 3:226 VO2ðL=minÞ
Fat oxidation ðg=minÞ ¼ 1:695 VO2ðL=minÞ
2 1:701 VCO2ðL=minÞ
Rates of CHO and fatty acid oxidation (mmol/kg/min) were
calculated by converting the rates of oxidation (g/kg/min) to
their molar equivalent. It was assumed that 6 mol of O2 is con-
sumedand6molofCO2isproducedforeachmoleofCHO(180g)
oxidized, and that the molecular mass of human triacylglycerol
is 855.3 g/mol. The molar rates of triacylglycerol oxidation
weremultipliedby3because eachmoleculecontains3 molecules
of fatty acid.
Blood sampling and analyses
Blood samples (6–10 ml) were collected into vacutainers that
contained EDTA and immediately analyzed for blood lactate
(YSI 2900 STAT Plus; YSI Life Sciences, Yellow Springs, OH,
USA) and total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, and triglyceride
concentration (Cobas b 101; Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The
remaining sample was then centrifuged at 1500 g for 10 min
at 4°C, and aliquots of plasma were stored at 280°C for later
analysis of free fatty acid (FFA; Wako Pure Chemical In-
dustries, Osaka, Japan), glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA), insulin (R-Biopharm Laboratory Diagnostics,
Taren Point, NSW, Australia), b-hydroxybutyrate (Sigma-
Aldrich), and glucose (Melbourne Pathology, Kilmore, VIC,
Australia) concentration.
Mitochondrial respiration analyses
Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were excised, and 10–20 mg was
immediately placed into 3 ml of ice-cold biopsy preservation
solution (Biops; 2.77 mM CaK2EGTA, 7.23 mM K2EGTA,
5.77mM Na2ATP,6.56mM MgCl2×6H2O,20 mMtaurine,15mM
Na2phosphocreatine, 20 mM imidazole, 0.5 mM DTT, 50 mM 2-
(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) hydrate; pH 7.1).
Muscle fibers were mechanically separated in ice-cold Biops to
maximize fiber surface area and transferred into ice-cold Biops
that was supplemented with saponin (50 mg/ml)for 30 min with
agitation to permeabilize the sarcolemma and allow the diffu-
sion of substrates. Fibers were then washed 3 times via agitation
in ice-cold MiR05 respiration medium (20 mM HEPES, 0.5 mM
EGTA, 10 mM KH2PO4, 3 mM MgCl2×6H2O, 60 mM lactobionic
acid, 20 mM taurine, 110 mM D-sucrose, 1 g/L bovine serum
albumin; pH 7.1). Fiber bundles were divided and weighed on
a microbalance (1.5–3 mg each) for respirometry analysis in
duplicate. All respiration analyses were commenced within 1 h
of sampling.
Electron transport system (ETS) and oxidative phosphoryla-
tion (oxphos) respiration were measured by using the Oxygraph
O2k high resolution respirometer (Oroboros Instruments,
Innsbruck, Austria) via a substrate-uncoupler-inhibitor titration
(SUIT) protocol at 37°C in MiR05 respiration medium with
magneticstirringat750rpm.Inbrief,afterfiberswereaddedand
O2 was injected to the respiration chamber (maintained between
300 and 500 pmol), the sequential addition SUIT protocol com-
menced with titrations of malate (2 mM final concentration)
and octanoylcarnitine (0.2 mM) to determine leak electron-
transferring flavoprotein (ETF) respiration. ETFp [ETF (ADP-
stimulated oxphos)] respiration was assessed by the addition of
ADP (5 mM), mitochondrial complex I (CI) substrate pyruvate
(5 mM), and mitochondrial complex II (CII) substrate succinate
(10 mM). Cytochrome c (10 mM) was added to confirm mitochon-
drial membrane integrity, and titrations of carbonyl cyanide-4-
(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (0.025 mM) were added
to determine uncoupled respiratory flux. Complex-specific
respiration was inhibited by the addition of rotenone (1 mM)
and antimycin A (5 mM) to CI and mitochondrial complex III
(CIII), respectively. Finally, mitochondrial complex IV (CIV)
capacity was measured during oxidation of N,N,N9,N9-
tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (0.5 mM)
with ascorbate (2 mM). O2 flux as a result of the auto-oxidation
of these chemicals was determined after the inhibition of CIV
with sodium azide (15 mM), then subtracted from the raw CIV
O2 flux. Chamber O2 concentration was maintained between
300 and 450 mΜ. Mass-specific O2 flux was determined from
steady-state flux normalized to tissue wet weight and adjusted
for instrumental background and residual O2 consumption.
Muscle glycogen concentration
Muscle glycogen concentration was determined, as described
previously (14). In brief, ;20 mg of muscle was freeze dried and
powdered, with all visible connective tissue removed under a
microscope. Glycogen was then extracted from the freeze-dried
sample, and glycogen concentration was determined via enzy-
matic analysis (15).
Citrate synthase activity
Whole skeletal muscle lysates were prepared at a concentration of
2 mg/ml, and 5 ml of sample was loaded onto a 96-well microtiter
plate with 40 ml of 3 mM acetyl CoA and 25 ml of 1 mM 5,59-
dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) in 165 ml of 100 mM Tris buffer (pH
8.3). Subsequently, 15 ml of 10 mM oxaloacetic acid was added to
each well and immediately analyzed by using a SpectraMax
Paradigmplatereader (MolecularDevices,Sunnyvale,CA,USA).
Absorbance was read at 412 nm and was recorded every 15 s for
3 min after 30 s of linear agitation. Maximal activity was recorded,
with citrate synthase activity reported in mol/h/kg protein.
Protein analyses
For the generation of whole skeletal muscle lysates, ;40 mg of
skeletalmusclewashomogenizedinbufferthatcontained50mM

1 mM benzamidine, and 1 mM PMSF. Samples were spun at
16,000 g for 30 min at 4°C and supernatant was collected. After
the determination of protein concentration via bicinchoninic acid
protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA), lysates were resus-
pended in Laemmli sample buffer, and 10 mg of protein of each
sample was loaded into 4–20% Mini-Protean TGX Stain-Free
Gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). For oxphos Ab cocktail,
8.5 mg of protein from unboiled lysates was loaded into 12%
polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, gels were activated

chased from Abcam (Cambridge, United Kingdom). The
volume density of each target band was normalized to total

(Bio-Rad), excluding the oxphos cocktail, which was nor-
malized to GAPDH imaged from the same membrane after the
addition of stripping buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wal-
tham, MA, USA) to the oxphos membrane and reprobing for

phoprotein was then normalized to its respective total protein.
Statistics
Statistical analysis was undertaken using SPSS for Windows
(v.20; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Data from the 2 experimental
conditions were analyzed by using a linear mixed model (treat-
ment 3 time), and subsequent post hoc comparisons were com-
pleted within the linear mixed model on the basis of the least
significant difference. Separate analysis was completed to
compare d 5of high-CHO diet with 100SS (fed)and d1 of HFAT
or HPRO with 5 d postdiet (fasting). Normality was visually
assessed by using the linear model residuals. Differences in TT
performance between trials were compared by using a paired
Student’s t test. Values of P ,0.05 were considered statistically
significant. All data are represented as means 6 SD.
RESULTS
All participants complied with the prescribed dietary
(Table 1) and training intervention for both conditions. No
difference was reported across the 5-d intervention pe-
riodsfordistancecoveredorRPEduringtrainingforeither
diet (HFAT, 222 6 23 km, 13 6 0.5; and HPRO, 196 6
29 km, 13 6 0.7, respectively).
Muscle glycogen concentrations
There was a significant main effect of time for muscle
glycogen concentration (P , 0.001; Fig. 2). Muscle glyco-
gen was reduced in both HFAT andHPRO conditions pre-
to postdiet (P , 0.001). After 1 d of high-CHO diet, muscle
glycogen increased by ;45% in both HFAT and HPRO
conditions (P , 0.001), but was not restored to prediet
values in HFAT (P , 0.001). After 100SS, muscle glycogen
was reduced in both HFAT and HPRO conditions (526 6
86 to 411 6 62 mmol/kg dry mass (DM), P = 0.033; 637 6
87 to 420 6 92 mmol/kg DM, P , 0.001, respectively);
however, no difference in the percentage change from pre-
to postexercise was measured between conditions.
Rates of substrate oxidation
There was a significant interaction effect for RER and rates
of CHO and fat oxidation (all P = 0.001; Fig. 3A–C) after
5 d of either HFAT or HPRO diet. RER was reduced pre- to
postdiet for both HFAT and HPRO (0.90 6 0.02 to 0.79 6

 was lower postdiet in HFAT compared with HPRO diet
(P , 0.001). Rates of fat oxidation increased after 5 d of
HFAT and HPRO diet, and were greater in HFAT com-
pared with HPRO postdiet (55 6 7 mmol/kg/min vs. 36 6
6 mmol/kg/min; P , 0.001). Concomitantly, rates of CHO
oxidation were reduced pre- to postdiet in both conditions,
and were lower in HFAT than in HPRO postdiet (106 6
20 mmol/kg/min vs. 169 6 17 mmol/kg/min; P , 0.001).
After1dofhigh-CHOdiet,RERvaluesreturnedtobaseline
in the HPRO trial during the first 20 min of 100SS, but
remained lower than baseline in the HFAT trial (HFAT,
0.93 6 0.02 to 0.90 6 0.03; P = 0.002). RER was lower in
HFAT compared with HPRO diet during the first 40
min of 100SS (P , 0.04). After 1 d of high-CHO diet,
rates of CHO oxidation were lower than baseline during
100SS after HFAT (P , 0.001) and were significantly
lower during 100SS in HFAT compared with HPRO
(213 6 35 mmol/kg/min vs. 241 6 31 mmol/kg/min;
P = 0.025, respectively). Rates of CHO oxidation declined
throughout100SSinHPRO(from241631mmol/kg/min
to 215 6 26 mmol/kg/min; P , 0.001), but remained
stable in HFAT (;208 mmol/kg/min). Despite 1 d of
high-CHO diet, rates of fat oxidation remained elevated
above baseline in the HFAT trial during the first 20 min
of 100SS (P = 0.002), but returned to baseline in HPRO.
During the first 20 min of 100SS, rates of fat oxidation
were significantly higher in HFAT than in HPRO (0.53 6
0.11 mmol/kg/min vs. 0.38 6 0.18 mmol/kg/min;
P = 0.010) and remained higher than HPRO after 40
and 80 min of exercise. Rates of fat oxidation increased
during 100SS in both HFAT and HPRO (P , 0.05).
Blood metabolites pre- and postdiet
There was a main effect of time for FFA concentration (P ,
0.001) pre- to postdiet. FFA concentration was greater after
exercise postdiet compared with prediet in both HFAT
(0.31 to 0.58 mM; P , 0.001) and HPRO (0.33 to 0.56 mM;
P , 0.001). There was a significant main effect of time (P =
0.013) and condition (P = 0.048) for LDL cholesterol. LDL
cholesterol increased pre- to postdiet in HFAT (2.44 6 0.63
to 2.93 6 0.75 mM) and was higher than HPRO postdiet
(2.93 6 0.75 vs. 2.55 6 0.71; P = 0.025). There was a signif-
icant interaction for HDL cholesterol and triglycerides (P =
0.010 and P = 0.042, respectively) between HFAT and
HPRO. HDL cholesterol increased (1.01 6 0.20 to 1.30 6
0.23 mM; P , 0.001) pre- to postdiet to be greater than in
HPRO (1.08 6 0.20 mM), whereas triglycerides decreased
(1.2660.46to0.6960.36mM;P=0.001)tobelowerthanin
HPRO (1.06 6 0.45 mM). No difference in total cholesterol
was measured between conditions from pre- to postdiet.
Blood metabolites during the
performance ride
There was a significant interaction for plasma glycerol
concentration between HFAT and HPRO diets (P = 0.035;
Fig. 4A). Glycerol concentration increased significantly
from rest after 60 min of exercise in HFAT and remained
elevated until after the TT. Glycerol concentrations were
significantly higher in HFAT than in HPRO after 40 min of
100SS. There was a significant effect of time for plasma
FFA (P , 0.001), although no differences were observed
between diets (Fig. 4B). FFA concentrations decreased 2 h
after CHO breakfast in both conditions and were elevated
from resting values after 60 min of 100SS until the
completion of the TT. Plasma b-hydroxybutyrate con-
centrations increased after CHO breakfast and remained
stable during 100SS in both conditions until after the TT

 (Fig. 4C). There was a main effect of time for blood lactate,
blood glucose, and plasma insulin concentrations (P ,
0.001) during 100SS, but no differences between diets (Fig.
4D–F). Blood glucose concentration decreased after the
CHO breakfast in both diets, but after 40 min of exercise,
glucose concentrations had returned to resting values.
Plasmainsulinconcentrationsincreasedinbothconditions
after breakfast and remained elevated 2 h after ingestion.
After the onset of exercise, insulin concentrations were
reduced in both conditions and were similar to pre-
breakfast values throughout 100SS. After 100SS, partici-
pants ingested a CHO drink that increased insulin
concentrations in both conditions, but this increase
was abolished after the onset of the TT. Blood lactate
concentrations remained stable throughout 100SS in both
conditions and were higher post-TT compared with rest in
HFAT (3.1 6 1.1 mM) and HPRO (3.1 6 1.0 mM) diets.
TT performance
There was no difference in TT performance between diet
conditions (30:59 6 2:55 vs. 30:10 6 2:70 min:s for HFAT
and HPRO, respectively). Mean power output during the
TT was 299 6 34 W and 304 6 35 W (P = 0.41) and HR
averaged 168 6 9 bpm and 166 6 7 bpm in HFAT and

 (20.86 6 0.79 kg) and HPRO (20.61 6 0.83 kg), although
there were no differences between conditions. No differ-
ence in RPE was reported between conditions during
100SS,althoughRPEincreasedthroughoutexerciseinboth
HFAT and HPRO diets (from 11 6 1 to 14 6 1; P , 0.001).
Skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration
On the basis of differences in whole-body substrate oxida-
tion rates pre- to postdiet and during prolonged exercise
between HFAT and HPRO diets (Fig. 3), we next assessed
whether skeletal muscle mitochondrial substrate utilization
was contributing to this outcome by using a sequential ad-
dition SUIT protocol. Absolute O2k respiration measures
that were taken from permeabilized skeletal muscle fiber
bundles analyzed in duplicate from each participant at each
time point and under each diet are reported in Table 2. To
portray the effects of diet and exercise on mitochondrial
respiration,percentagechangedataarerepresentedinFig.5.
Although HFAT and HPRO absolute O2k values were not
significantly different after either diet (Table 2), there was a
significant interaction in thepercentage change of CI +ETFp
respiration after HFAT and HPRO diets (P = 0.042; Fig. 5A).
Thediet-inducedreductioninCI+ETFprespirationafterthe

ferences in absolute O2k values, the percentage change of
ETS uncoupled respiration (Fig.5A;ETS CI + CII +ETF; ETS

muscle citrate synthase activity across time or between diets
(;20 mol/h/kg; Fig. 5D).
Immunoblot analyses
Total protein contents of citrate synthase (Fig. 5E) and
oxphos complexes I–V (Fig. 6A–F) were not different be-
tween HFAT and HPRO diets at any time point during the
intervention. Oxphos CIII demonstrated a trend toward a
maineffectfortime(P=0.073),withadecreasefrompre-to
post-HFAT diet. There was a significant interaction for
FAT/CD36 protein content (P , 0.001) from prediet to
after 1 d of high-CHO diet (Fig. 7A). FAT/CD36 protein
content was higher pre- and postdiet and pre- and post-
100SS in HFAT compared with HPRO diet. There were no
differencesintotalCPT1afrompre-topost-high-CHOdiet
in either HFAT or HPRO diets (Fig. 7B). No main effects
were found for AMPK Thr172 phosphorylation levels
relative to total AMPK, although a trend toward a main
effect of time was observed (P = 0.06), with an increase
after HFAT (Fig. 7C). There was an effect of time for ACC
Ser79 phosphorylation relative to total ACC (P = 0.015).
ACC Ser79 relative to total ACC was greater in HFAT
after 100SS compared with post-HFAT diet (Fig. 7D).
There were no differences in mTOR Ser2448 phosphor-
ylation relative to total mTOR prediet compared with
after 1 d of high-CHO (Fig. 7E). There was a significant
effect of time for RPS6 Ser235/236 phosphorylation rel-
ative to total RPS6 (P , 0.05). RPS6 Ser235/236 phos-
phorylation increased after 100SS in HPRO compared
with pre- and postdiet (Fig. 7F). RPS6 Ser235/236
phosphorylation was also higher postexercise in HPRO
compared with HFAT diet (P = 0.034).

 DISCUSSION
This is the first study to manipulate dietary fat and protein
content while simultaneously clamping dietary CHO in-
take during a short-term period of intense exercise training
in well-trained humans. Such an experimental design is
essential in the effort to pinpoint potential mechanisms that
underlie the high rates of fat oxidation that have been re-
ported after short-term adaptation to fat-rich diets, which
persistevenafter1dofglycogenrestorationwithhighCHO
intake (2, 7) and/or high exogenous CHO availability (4, 5,
7). The results of the present study provide novel insights
into the mechanisms that govern patterns of substrate oxi-
dation in response to diet–exercise interactions. We report
that,comparedwithanisoenergetichigh-proteindiet,5dof
adaptation to an HFAT diet results in greater whole-body
rates of fat oxidation during submaximal cycling and im-
pairments in mitochondrial respiration.
A series of independent studies during the past 2 de-
cades (2, 4, 5, 7, 8) have compared HFAT vs. high-CHO
diets and demonstrated that short-term(,7 d) HFAT diets
result in peak rates of whole-body fat oxidation of ;1 g/
min (;50 mmol/kg/min), values that are typically 2-fold
greater than after isoenergetic high-CHO diets (2, 7). Rates
of fat oxidation in the present investigation (1.2 g/min)
after an identical period of a fat-rich diet were similar to
those reported previously; however, the first novel finding
from the present study was that rates of fat oxidation were
33% greater than after 5 d of a low-CHO, HPRO diet
(0.8 g/min). We report an increase in postexercise plasma
FFA concentration from prediet interventions in HFAT
and HPRO that likely contributed to the increased rates of
fat oxidation after both conditions; however, the higher
rates of fat oxidation in HFAT compared with HPRO diet
are likely associated with altered rates of whole-body li-
polysis and the subsequent storage of triglycerides (6, 16,
17). Previous work has demonstrated higher rates of
whole-body lipolysis, determined by elevated glycerol
concentration, and this increase was associated with an
elevated intramuscular triglyceride (IMTG) concentration
after fat adaptation (6, 18); limited muscle biopsy sample
did not permit IMTG measurements in the current study.
It is also known that low CHO availability reduces circu-
lating insulin concentrations, which could increase rates of
whole-body fat oxidation. Although CHO intake was
identical in both dietary conditions, it is likely that a pro-
portion of protein in HPRO diet was converted to glucose
via gluconeogenesis (19), which may explain the slightly
higher muscle glycogen concentrations postdiet in HPRO
compared with HFAT diet. Greater availability of muscle
glycogen likely contributed to lower rates of whole-body
fat oxidation in HPRO compared with HFAT diet. Ac-
cordingly, the higher rates of fat oxidation measured af-
ter HFAT are likely driven by higher fat, rather than low
CHO, availability.
Despite CHO intake being clamped in both dietary
conditions, rates of CHO oxidation were lower after 5 d of
HFATcomparedwithHPROdiet.RatesofCHOoxidation
were reduced by 50% (3 to 1.5 g/min) after HFAT diet
compared with a 25% decline(2.3 g/min)after HPRO diet.

 The greater oxidation of CHO-based fuels may be
explained by the slightly higher muscle glycogen con-
centration postdiet in HPRO compared with HFAT diet,
which has previously been demonstrated to increase the
reliance on CHO-based fuels during subsequent exercise
(20). Without a protein tracer in the current study, we
were unable to detect the proportion of protein that was
converted to glucose. After a 6-d HFAT diet (63% EI from
fat), Peters et al. (21) observed a decrease in the active form
of the rate-limiting enzyme in CHO metabolism, PDH,
and, consequently, a reduction in rates of CHO oxidation
during exercise, which was not observed after a moderate
CHO diet (52% EI from CHO). Therefore, a decrease in
PDH activity may have contributed to the observed re-
duction in whole-body rates of CHO oxidation in the
present study (5); however, limitations in muscle biopsy
sample did not permit the assessment of PDH activity.
To furtherdetermine potential mechanismsforreduced
CHO oxidation, we assessed skeletal muscle mitochon-
drialrespiration to measure the dietaryeffects on substrate
flux and utilization. We found that respiration supported
by octanoylcarnitine and pyruvate (CI + ETFp) was sig-
nificantly reduced after 5 d of HFAT diet, but not HPRO
diet, when CIII and/or CIV were operating at or near
maximal activity. In our interpretations of mitochondrial
respiration dataobtained by using the Oroboros O2k SUIT
protocol, it is important to note that supraphysiologic
mitochondrial substrate concentrations and a sequential
addition protocol were used; therefore, interpretations of
substrate-specific effects on respiration must be made with
caution, because this protocol does not allow us to pin-
point whether the addition of a particular substrate alone
or any previously added substrate in the protocol are
responsible for the effect. Nonetheless, it was surprising
that FFA (i.e., octanoylcarnitine)-driven mitochondrial
respiration (ETF leak) was not subsequently increased
with HFAT diet. Decreased respiration observed after the
addition of octanoylcarnitine and pyruvate is in line with
previous studies that have reported that HFAT diets re-
duce the amount of PDH, in its active form (PDHa), and
PDHa activity at rest, but not after a moderate CHO diet
(21). Alterations in PDH activity have additionally been
identified as a mechanism that underlies the regulation of
metabolic flexibility in isolated rodent skeletal muscle
mitochondria in response to altered substrate availability
inducedby high-fat feeding(22).In addition,the reduction
in respiration after 5 d of HFAT diet persisted after
uncoupling (ETS CI + CII + ETF, and ETS CII), which
suggests that the functional reductions in respiration oc-
curred either at the level of CI/CII or downstream at CIII/
CIV, but not at complex V (ATP synthase). In line with the
observed reductions in uncoupled respiration, Skovbro
et al. (23) have reported that ETFp and uncoupled respi-
ration were decreased after a longer high-fat feeding pe-
riod (i.e., 16 d; 55–60% fat) compared with a moderate
CHO diet (i.e., 55–60% CHO) (23). The mitochondrial ef-
fects of HFAT diet in the present study may have been
more pronounced after a longer dietary intervention pe-
riod. In addition, the type of the dietary fat intake has
previously been demonstrated to affect mitochondrial
function and morphology (24). Lionetti et al. (24) have
demonstrated that high saturated fat intake was associated
with greater mitochondrial dysfunction compared with
intake of unsaturated fat in rodents. The current study
provided a 65% fat diet, made up of 55% saturated fat, and
whetherthereductionsinmitochondrialrespirationwould

 be observed with a different dietary fat composition re-
quires additional investigation. As no changes in mito-
chondrialrespirationwereobservedafter5dofHPROdiet,
this suggests that the primary driver of these skeletal
muscle adaptations is high dietary fat availability. On the
basis of the evidence in the present study, the biochemical
explanation of why HFAT diet results in increased whole-
body fat oxidation despite reduced skeletal muscle mito-
chondrial respiration is inconclusive and warrants future
investigation of mitochondria in other tissues. Given that
potential HFAT diet–induced changes in the delivery and
transport of fatty acids across the sarcolemma are removed
in the ex vivo analysis of mitochondrial respiration, these
additional variables may also contribute to the observed
increases in fat oxidation at the whole body level.
Although we observed changes in respiration after the
addition of octanoylcarnitine and pyruvate and uncou-
pled respiration with HFAT, we detected no differences in
the skeletal muscle protein content of the 5 mitochondrial
oxphos complexes after either dietary condition. In addi-
tion, neither citrate synthase protein content, nor maxi-
mal activity was changed. Given that changes in CI and
citrate synthase activity have strong associations with
mitochondrial content (i.e., volume and/or density), this
suggests that content is not affected by either short-term
HFAT or HPRO availability (25). Instead, we speculate
that changes in enzyme activities that regulate mitochon-
drial substrate flux likely contribute to the reduced respi-
ration observed after short-term adaptation to HFAT diet.
To determine the alternative enzymes and signaling
pathways that are impacted by HFAT and HPRO diets, we
measuredputativetransporterswithrolesinskeletalmuscle
fatty acid uptake and 2 energy-sensing metabolic signaling
pathways, AMPK and mTOR. There was a 12% increase in
FAT/CD36 protein observed after HFAT, which suggests
potential increased capacity for sarcolemmal and/or mito-
chondrial membrane fatty acid uptake, although this in-
crease in FAT/CD36 did not reach statistical significance.
No change in mitochondrial CPT1 was observed after 5 d of
HFAT or HPRO diets. These findings are in agreement with
previous works that reported that an HFAT diet, together
with an intensive training program, resulted in significantly
greater (i.e., a 17% increase) protein abundance of FAT/
CD36 without a change in gene expression of CPT1 (16).
Low-CHO diets, together with periods of endurance train-
ing, have previously been shown to increase AMPK acti-
vation and signaling to its downstream substrate ACC (26);
however, no significant change was reported in AMPK
Thr172 phosphorylation relative to total AMPK, or in its
substrate ACC Ser79 phosphorylation relative to total ACC
after the dietary interventions. No differences postdiet were
observedinmTORSer2448phosphorylationrelativetototal

 mTOR and in phosphorylation of its substrate RPS6
Ser235/236 relative to total RPS6 in HFAT or HPRO diets.
Together, these findings suggest that fatty acid transporter
abundance and activation of these energy-sensing path-
wayswereunaffectedbythe2dietinterventions,perhapsas
a result of the high training status of the cyclists and the
ability to cope with the demand of the dietary overload.
Additional investigation is required to uncover alternative
proteinsignalingpathwaysthatareassociatedwithchanges
in substrate metabolism that may underpin the dietary ef-
fects on skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration.
After CHO restoration strategies (e.g., 1 d of high-CHO
diet, a pre-exercise CHO-rich breakfast, and CHO intake
during exercise), muscle glycogen increased in both HFAT
andHPROdiets,butdidnotreachpreinterventionvaluesin
the HFAT diet. This may be a result of the brief (24 h) CHO
restoration period compared with 5 d of high CHO intake
before baseline measures. Rates of fat oxidation and CHO
oxidation returned to baseline values during 100SS cycling
in both HFAT and HPRO diets, and were similar to the
results observed in the prediet protocol; however, the CHO
restoration and exercise feeding protocols involved ag-
gressive strategies to promote high CHO availability from
both exogenous and endogenous sources compared with
overnight-fasting and water-fed conditions in the prediet
protocol. Therefore, rates of fat oxidation were higher and
CHO oxidation lower than expected during the 100SS
protocol on d 7, particularly with HFAT. Indeed, although
the present study did not include a direct comparison to a
chronichigh-CHOdietasinourpriorinvestigations(2,4,7),
our results are consistent with previous observations that
muscle adaptation during chronic periods of a low-CHO
diet, especially in the case of the HFAT diet, is sufficiently
robust to persist despite the restoration of CHO (2, 4, 7). For
example, CHO oxidation rates after HFAT or HPRO diet
and CHO restoration in the current study were lower than
those reported in previous studies following a controlled
(chronic high CHO) diet (200–220 mmol/kg/min vs.
250–300 mmol/kg/min) (7). Muscle glycogen utilization in
the current study was ;100-mmol/kg DM lower than that
previously reported with HFAT intervention (2), and was
slightly higher in HPRO compared with HFAT diet. This
difference may be related to higher pre-exercise muscle
glycogen in HPRO. Overall, this reduced capacity for CHO
oxidation in HFAT diet, despite the availability of exoge-
nous and endogenous stores, was previously associated
with the persistent down-regulation of PDH activity (5).
Whole-body rates of fat oxidation after CHO restora-
tion remained slightly higher after HFAT compared with
HPRO, but this resulted in only a small difference in
the total fat oxidized during 100SS cycling (;15 g over
100 min). No difference was measured for FFA concen-
trationsbetweenthe2dietaryconditions,althoughplasma
glycerol concentrations were greater during exercise after
HFAT compared with HPRO. Elevated glycerol concen-
tration after HFAT diet indicates a greater rate of
whole-bodylipolysisthatcouldbeassociatedwithgreater
IMTG utilization and/or liberation of FFA into the blood,
thereby contributing to the minor variation in rates of
whole-body fat oxidation between HFAT and HPRO di-
ets. Corresponding to total fat utilization, there were only
minor differences in total CHO oxidized between HFAT
and HPRO diets (;30 g) during 100 min of exercise.
Although 1 d of high CHO availability in the current
study failed to fully reverse the differences in the whole-
body rates of substrate oxidation, it was sufficient to re-
store the decreased mitochondrial respiration (CI + ETFp)
fromHFATtopredietvalues.Thisindicatesthattheremay
be an additional underlying mechanism that regulates
changes in substrate oxidation (i.e., down-regulating CHO
oxidation) and mitochondrial respiration. As the current
study precluded the investigation of a high-CHO trial as a
result of the high numberof biopsies that would have been
required,weareunabletospeculatewhetherdifferencesin
mitochondrial respiration would have been observed be-
tween the 3 dietary conditions. We also reported greater
postexercise reductions in CI + ETFp and CI + CII + ETFp
respiration in HFAT diet than in HPRO diet, and this was
not attributable to reductions to citrate synthase protein or
activity. These effects of exercise after HFAT diet may be
attributable to mitochondrial adaptations at the cessation
of exercise that impact ETC, including changes in signal-
ing, mitochondrial membrane dynamics, and/or buffer-
ing of reactive oxygen species. It should also be noted that
there could have been damage to myofibers during sepa-
ration and permeabilization. This could limit the in-
terpretation of the respiratory valuesbefore the addition of
cytochrome c in the SUIT protocol as it occasionally in-
creased O2 flux .10% above CI + CII + ETFp (Table 2).
Despite this, we are confident that the data before the ad-
dition of cytochrome c is still meaningful because the effect
was consistent across all trials. To determine the effect of
potential shifts in substrate utilization on exercise perfor-
mance, previous studies have included a cycling TT after a
bout of steady-state exercise after high-CHO intake. Burke
et al. (2) reported similar TT performance between HFAT
and high-CHO trials, and in the present study, we did not
detect any difference in TT performance between HFAT
and HPRO diet after 1 d of CHO restoration; however, we
cannot compare this performance with a high-CHO con-
dition, and the shifts in substrate utilization therefore re-
quire additional investigation.
In summary, the results of the present investigation
demonstrate that whole-body rates of fat oxidation in-
crease to a greater extent in trained humans after high
dietary fat intake compared with an HPRO diet, when
CHO is clamped at 20% of energy intake. High dietary fat
intake also reduced mitochondrial respiration supported
by octanoylcarnitine and pyruvate as well as uncoupled
respiration. These reductions in mitochondrial “function”
may be compensatory, and note solely “driving” fuel reg-
ulation under the conditions of our investigation. Addi-
tional mechanistic investigation into potential underlying
diet-induced differences in mitochondrial membrane
dynamics, mitochondrial complex subunits, and addi-
tional enzymes that regulate mitochondrial substrate
flux is warranted. The acute, but aggressive, restoration
of endogenous and exogenous CHO availability was
unable to completely restore normal rates of substrate
oxidation, but was able to reverse the fat-induced dis-
ruption of mitochondrial respiration. Together, these
findings demonstrate the impact that an HFAT diet has
