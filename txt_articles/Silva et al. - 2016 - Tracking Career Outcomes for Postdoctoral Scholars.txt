Abstract
The oversupply of postdoctoral scholars relative to available faculty positions has led to
calls for better assessment of career outcomes. Here, we report the results of a study of
postdoctoral outcomes at the University of California, San Francisco, and suggest that insti-
tutions have an obligation to determine where their postdoc alumni are employed and to
share this information with current and future trainees. Further, we contend that local efforts
will be more meaningful than a national survey, because of the great variability in training
environment and the classification of postdoctoral scholars among institutions. We provide
a framework and methodology that can be adopted by others, with the goal of developing a
finely grained portrait of postdoctoral career outcomes across the United States.
Introduction
Both the prodigious output and global preeminence of the United States academic research
enterprise depend on the contributions of postdoctoral scholars (postdocs). We posit that post-
docs participate in a system that evolved many decades ago, in which they receive mentoring
intended to prepare them for independent academic research careers, in exchange for provid-
ing labor, producing data, writing manuscripts, and preparing grant applications. We believe
this model disproportionately benefits those postdocs who move into faculty positions. Even in
institutions with dedicated career professionals and services, the support and guidance for
those who eventually move into non-faculty positions is a relatively small part of the complete
postdoctoral experience, which is widely viewed as an apprenticeship for a faculty position.
While recent literature suggests that only a minority of postdocs move into faculty positions,
efforts to determine what postdocs do after their training, and to accurately determine the pro-
portion in faculty positions, have consistently failed [1–3]. Over the past 20 years, at least three
major reports [1–3], including the recently released The Postdoctoral Experience Revisited from
the National Academy of Sciences, have called for improved tracking of the career outcomes of
the nation’s postdocs as a prerequisite for addressing their training needs. These calls have
largely gone unheeded.

 Here, we report the results of our study of postdoctoral career outcomes at the University of
California, San Francisco (UCSF)—which we believe to be the most comprehensive single-
institution study conducted to date—and provide a framework and methodology that can be
replicated at other institutions. This approach offers the transparency required for postdocs to
make informed career decisions.
Our data reveal that outcomes vary according to training (PhD versus MD/PhD) and the
location of employment (United States versus non-US). We discuss the false dichotomizing of
faculty positions as “tenure-track” versus “non-tenure-track,” which fails to acknowledge the
increasing nuance in academic appointments and misleads postdocs as they weigh their
options. Finally, we argue that institutions cannot wait for change at the level of national policy;
we propose that institutions must accept responsibility for providing better transparency of
career outcomes to the fullest extent possible at a local level, to give postdocs timely and perti-
nent information to enable them to prepare for their futures.
Postdoc Career Outcomes Study: Method and Findings
We focused our investigation on outcomes for PhDs who entered US-based employment from
2000 to 2013, compiled from the reports required under the Ruth L. Kirschstein National
Research Service Award (T32) funding scheme of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) [4].
These reports list the current employment status and positions for all students and postdocs
who trained in a lab participating in a T32 program, regardless of funding source (postdocs
were supported by a variety of mechanisms, including direct T32 support, individual fellow-
ship, faculty research grant, foreign support), and they require trainee follow-up for 10 years
after leaving UCSF. Additional details of the T32 funding program are described in the sup-
porting information.
When we commenced our study in the spring of 2014, UCSF had 55 active T32 awards.
After excluding predoctoral students, clinical (non-research) fellows, trainees who were still at
UCSF, and those who did not hold a PhD or PhD-equivalent, we were left with data for 1,431
postdoctoral scholars from 28 training programs (S1 Table), representing the research groups
of 277 UCSF faculty. We estimate this figure to be 33% of all postdocs who separated from
UCSF from 2000 to 2013 (see supplementary materials). We then conducted web searches to
identify and confirm the job title and employer for each former trainee at the time of the study.
For those in academic positions, we relied on PubMed, using the author information on pub-
lished papers, and verified status using university websites. For those outside of academic
research roles, we relied primarily on LinkedIn, corroborating our information using govern-
ment, corporate, and non-profit organization websites (S1 Fig). We then classified job titles
according to workforce sector and appointment category (Fig 1, S4 Table), which contrasts
with other approaches undertaken in reports of graduate student outcomes and with our pre-
liminary analysis of this dataset previously made available at http://postdocs.ucsf.edu/news/
career-outcomes.
We initially investigated outcomes for PhDs without a medical degree (MD) who went into
US-based employment (899 total). We wanted to better understand the career opportunities
afforded by the extended and specialized training accrued specifically through postdoctoral
research, to identify employers who choose to capitalize on this training, and to identify the
sectors of the workforce in which these employers operate. We found 81% (731/899) of UCSF
postdoc alumni were employed in areas typically thought of as PhD-related careers: research or
teaching in academia and research in industry or government settings. If we include those
working in science-related non-research positions (e.g., K–12 education, communication, pol-
icy, regulation, administration, and business development; S5 Table), the proportion engaged

 in the research enterprise climbs to 93% (837/899). Four percent (33/899) were getting further
training, 2% (19/899) worked in non-science related jobs, and 1% (10/899) could not be
accounted for.
Attainment of a faculty position in an academic setting is the most commonly cited primary
career goal for postdoctoral trainees [5,6], so we next sought to determine the proportion of
UCSF postdocs who had attained these positions. Our experience working with UCSF’s postdoc-
toral population through the Office of Career and Professional Development revealed that “desir-
able positions” also include appointments at government and non-profit research institutions,
such as the NIH or the Gladstone Institutes. Thus, we asked what proportion of former UCSF
postdocs attained academic faculty positions, including those holding titles of assistant, associate,
or full professor at a university, or an equivalent title at a research or government institution (see
Fig 2 and S4 Table). We found that 37% (336/899) of US-employed postdoc alumni were in

US (n = 899), (B) MD/PhD-trained postdoc alumni employed in the US (n = 141), (C) PhD-trained postdoc alumni employed outside the US (n = 329),
and (D) MD/PhD-trained postdoc alumni employed outside the US (n = 62).

 faculty positions, that is, in faculty or faculty-like full-time research or teaching positions. We fur-
ther classified the institutions at which these alumni were employed using a system based on the
Carnegie classification framework (http://carnegieclassifications.iu.edu/) and determined that the
majority of these faculty are employed at research institutions (see S6 Table).
Interestingly, we observed very different outcomes for two specific sub-populations of post-
docs not included in the above calculations. First, of the 23% of UCSF’s postdoc alumni who
had left the United States, 54% (179/329) were in faculty positions (Fig 2, S3 Table). The pro-
portion of UCSF postdocs who are on non-resident visa status varies between 52% and 63%
(S3 Table). Thus, less than half of international postdocs at UCSF leave the US following their
training, and so this subgroup likely consists primarily of foreign nationals. It is unclear
whether the differences we observed are due to differences in opportunities abroad or in the
career aspirations of foreign nationals undertaking training at UCSF. Second, of the 10% of
postdoc alumni employed in the US and who hold both a PhD and an MD (or equivalent),
57% (81/141) were in faculty positions (Fig 2). We believe that many of those MD/PhDs hold-
ing research faculty appointments are likely to have joint clinical appointments. Interestingly,
the subgroup with the highest rate of placement in faculty positions consisted of MD/PhDs
employed outside the US: 71% (44/62).
Faculty positions are often colloquially referred to as “tenure-track” positions, often featur-
ing in career development resources and articles and in discussions of the biomedical work-
force. However, we found that tenure-track is not an accurate description of many academic
faculty appointments in the biomedical sciences at research universities: positions may be insti-
tution-funded or grant-funded (“hard money” or “soft money”) and may come with varying
degrees of stability (either through a tenure commitment or other funding arrangement).
Through our work at UCSF, we consistently observe that postdocs do not recognize that the

faculty positions (i.e., with titles of assistant professor, associate professor, or full professor, or equivalent titles
in other sectors, such as group leader or investigator); those in research and teaching positions that are not
faculty; and those in positions that are not research or teaching. Figures are presented as a proportion of the full
population of alumni included in this study.

 term tenure-track is over-applied and used colloquially rather than as an accurate description
of a given faculty appointment. The confusion is exacerbated by the absence of this distinction
in public-facing profiles at most universities, leading postdocs to assume that a professor title is
indicative of a tenure-line position. We wanted to better understand the proportion of faculty
positions that might be considered truly tenure-line, so we looked at postdoctoral alumni
employed as faculty at UCSF and determined their true status using data provided by UCSF’s
Office of Academic Affairs. Of the UCSF postdoc alumni who attained UCSF faculty positions,
21% (19/92) are in the university’s tenure-track series.
To investigate the potential influence of individual training environments (the specific fac-
ulty mentor for each postdoc) on career outcomes, we calculated the percentage of postdoc
alumni for every mentor with at least 10 postdocs in our dataset (see S7 Table). We observed con-
siderable variation in the outcomes depending on the mentor (from a high of 93% to a low of 9%
placement in faculty appointments), but we cannot draw conclusions about the training environ-
ment due to the small sample sizes. Institutions might consider encouraging faculty to publish
their postdoc alumni career outcomes to provide greater transparency to prospective postdocs.
What Are the Implications for Postdoctoral Scholars Nationwide?
We are aware that UCSF is not typical of US research institutions, in that our institution
focuses almost exclusively on biomedical research and graduate-level training and receives the
second largest amount of NIH funding (S3 Table) [7]. Thus, the career outcomes we present
here will not be representative of a national average. A recent study revealed that 70%–85% of
career-track positions in a diverse set of disciplines at ten different universities are filled by
alumni from an elite 25% of institutions [8]. Inferring that faculty appointments in the biomed-
ical sciences would be subject to the same trends, it is likely that UCSF postdocs move into fac-
ulty positions at a rate higher than the national average, and maybe far higher than some
individual institutions. Yet just 37% of UCSF’s postdoctoral trainees secure faculty positions.
Other major academic medical centers with comparable funding/research profiles may see
results similar to ours, but we predict that postdocs employed outside the elite 25% of institu-
tions are less likely to attain faculty positions.
We acknowledge that we cannot exclude the possibility of bias within our dataset. The post-
docs in our study fall under a funding mechanism intended to improve training, which might
be expected to affect career outcomes. However, these postdocs are in a range of labs, with
mentors who may or may not have direct involvement with the grant, and are supported by a
range of mechanisms. In addition, when we examine the career outcomes for postdocs accord-
ing to individual labs and mentors, we see enormous variation in the proportion of alumni in
faculty appointments (S7 Table), a result that is consistent with what might be expected from
an analysis of the full postdoc alumni population.
National conversations frequently include discussion of the availability of “tenure-track”
positions, because postdocs continue to cite tenure-track positions as their primary career aspi-
ration. We propose that focusing on the number of tenure-track positions misleads postdocs in
two ways: it fails to acknowledge the breadth of desirable independent research positions, and
it oversimplifies the terms of employment under which principal investigators work. Academic
faculty candidates negotiate increasingly nuanced and complex contracts that may not include
tenure (e.g., 79% of our sample who are in UCSF faculty positions are non-tenure-track) and
may not involve significant institutional commitment to salary. Knowing that job stability and
institutional commitment may factor into many postdocs’ career decisions, we call for better
transparency in the career outcomes of postdocs and the nature of available positions. This
transparency should include more accurate application of the term “tenure-track.”

 Institutions Have a Responsibility to Take Action
We maintain that tracking career outcomes is the first step in addressing the career-planning
needs of current and future postdocs. Building robust mechanisms for tracking postdoctoral
populations as they move through their careers will enable detection of job trends and inform
accompanying shifts in career support and training, and should also include demographic data
that have not been historically available, such as gender, ethnicity, and age.
Importantly, new tracking efforts ought to be accompanied by a retrospective study. It would
be easier for institutions to begin tracking career outcomes by surveying postdocs as they leave
the institution, but it would then take years to reach a meaningful sample size, particularly at
institutions with smaller postdoc populations. Such an effort will be of use to future postdocs and
must be undertaken to meet their needs, but it fails those currently in the system. Equally, institu-
tions should not rely on the minimal career outcomes reporting requirements for their T32
grants. Many institutions do not hold T32 training grants and therefore do not have reports to
which they can refer. Where these reports do exist, they are often inadequate in that they are
designed to be scanned quickly as one component of a lengthy grant application, not to be mined
meticulously for data collection and analysis. The hard work must be done to corroborate the
employment status of postdocs as reported in those grant application data tables.
Thus far, much of the conversation about postdocs and their roles in the scientific workforce
has been enmeshed in wider discussions of biomedical research policy [9,10]. National initia-
tives are well intentioned, but the complexity of remodeling entrenched practices—and doing
so in a way that will work for hundreds of different institutions—means that change will take
many years. In addition, national data collection and aggregation will blur important distinc-
tions among institutions of different sizes, sites, and emphases. We observed very different out-
comes depending on academic training (medical degree or not) and employment location (US
or non-US). Regional labor markets feature local concentrations of opportunities, even for
PhD-level scientists [11,12], and recent work revealed that the specific field for a doctoral
degree influences employment sector, job placement, and earning potential [12]. We predict
that mapping of local trends will reveal distinct clusters of career outcomes, and assembling a
collective portrait rather than a single aggregate dataset will be necessary to provide current
and future postdocs with sufficient information to make informed career decisions.
In their frustration with the inertia of the system, many postdocs have resorted to grassroots
actions [13]. We think that responsibility for action should not be delegated to postdocs them-
selves. Their grassroots efforts are highly commendable, but their success and sustainability
depend on support from departments and institutions. With robust data on career outcomes in
hand, institutions can readily deploy an abundance of existing and freely available information,
resources, strategies, and curricula. The data can be used immediately as a career development
resource, enabling current postdocs to become acquainted with the opportunities available to
them. Coupling this information with the development of an alumni network will enable post-
docs to connect more readily with opportunities for career exploration, identification of skills
and knowledge gaps, and cultivation of professional networks. Importantly, sustainable programs
can be implemented in a matter of weeks or months, not years, at relatively little expense.
Our analysis reveals that the overwhelming majority of UCSF postdoc alumni (93%) move
into positions that meet institutional and national training mandates, as a highly skilled work-
force supporting the biomedical research enterprise. Yet the implied agreement described
above—research productivity in exchange for career mentoring toward a faculty position—
may not address the true needs of the majority of postdocs. Our recommendations for action
at the institutional level should not be viewed as an adequate substitute for wider commitment
from funding agencies at the level of policy. Equally, individual institutions must not defer

 responsibility while waiting for a cultural shift to ripple through the entire biomedical research
enterprise. In order for universities and research institutions to appropriately serve postdoc-
toral trainees while simultaneously acknowledging the valuable contributions they make to sci-
entific discovery, we advocate deployment of the methodology described here. Meaningful and
long-lasting change must begin at the level of the institution.
