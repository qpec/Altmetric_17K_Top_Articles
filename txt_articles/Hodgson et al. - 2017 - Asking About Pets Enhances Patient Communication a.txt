Abstract
This research explored whether asking patients about their pets would enable better environmental/social history taking, and 
improve patient communication/care. Primary health care providers (PHPs) were surveyed about prevalence of patients living 
with pets, the health impact of pets, and influences on patient communication. Following an educational intervention, they 
committed to asking patients about their pets. A follow-up survey was conducted electronically. PHPs were recruited at a 
continuing medical education (CME) conference and at CME workshops. All 225 participants were PHPs. At the conference, 
participants were educated one-on-one about the clinical relevance of pets in the family. CME sessions were large or small 
group teaching. Baseline and final surveys measured awareness of pets in patients’ families, assessment of determinants of 
health, impact on rapport with patients, and patient care. A sign test assessed difference in scores using repeated-measures 
analysis. Binomial outcomes were assessed using Fisher’s exact test. Comments were themed. Ninety-four PHPs (42%) 
completed the study. Pet-related discussions opened communication with patients. Two-thirds of participants identified 
positive effects on practice and on relationships with patients. PHPs were able to leverage the health benefits of pets 
(zooeyia) and mitigate zoonotic risk. Asking patients about pets in the family reveals clinically relevant information, improves 
communication, and strengthens the therapeutic alliance.

Pilot Study
Purpose
Primary care encompasses patient-centered communication 
and care, exploring determinants of health, activating family 
resources, developing rapport, and building a therapeutic 
alliance with patients. Nonjudgmental, open-ended ques-
tions begin conversations with patients about how they live.1 
Asking patients about their pets can open communication, 
reveal clinically relevant information, and offer insights into 
their lives.2 Sixty-five percent of American households 
include pets.3 Children are more likely to live with a pet than 
a sibling or their biological father.4 Pet owners think of their 
companion animals as members of the family.5 The strong 
bonds people have with their pets6,7 are a valuable resource 
to primary health care providers (PHPs), enabling implemen-
tation of self-care.
Pets both benefit and risk human health, affecting all 
areas of their owners’ lives. The positive effects (collectively 
known as zooeyia)8 are powerful.2 Pets build social capital 
and provide companionship.9 They motivate healthy behav-
ior change, such as increasing physical activity10 and encour-
aging activities of daily living.11 They are agents of harm 
reduction, for example as a reason to quit smoking.12,13 
Animal companions can complement medical and psycho-
logical therapy as part of patients’ normal lives, without 
additional cost.14,15 Like all relationships, pet ownership has 
its risks. The risk of zoonotic disease varies with the species 
of the pet16 and with the patient.17 Owners can be injured 
when interacting with their animals. Pets impact the shared 
environment and can challenge family resources (financial, 
emotional, and social).2

INQUIRY
Despite these profound effects, PHPs may be unaware of 
pets in their patients’ families. This study explored 2 factors of 
PHPs asking their patients about pets in the family when col-
lecting family/social histories and when clinically relevant:
•
•
Does asking about pets enable PHPs to better assess 
determinants of health, social context, and environ-
mental history?
•
•
Do PHPs find that discussions about pets lead to 
improved patient communication and care?
Methods
Conforming to the protocol approved by the Research Ethics 
Board of Markham Stouffville Hospital, PHPs were recruited 
individually at Primary Care Today, a large continuing medi-
cal education (CME) symposium held on May 6-9, 2015, in 
Toronto. Four additional CME presentations were advertised 
through flyers distributed there and by email to members of 
the Ontario College of Family Physicians and the Ontario 
Medical Association. The family physicians, nurses, and 
social workers who attended these CME events were also 
invited to participate in the study. Informed consent was 
acquired from all participants. Each was randomly assigned 
a unique 4-digit number to enable matching data from base-
line and follow-up surveys. No patient data were requested 
or collected.
A baseline survey focused on PHP’s general knowledge 
of their patients’ pets (how many live with pets and what pet-
related discussions revealed about how their patients live), 
the frequency of discussions with patients about the 4 cate-
gories of zooeyia and the 4 categories of zoonotic risk, and 
whether the PHP had ever collaborated with a veterinarian 
regarding patient care.
CME interventions informed participants educated about 
pets’ impact on people’s health—the benefits of zooeyia, the 
zoonotic risks associated with pets, and the opportunity to 
facilitate interprofessional collaboration with veterinarians. 
An algorithm for asking about pets was reviewed:
•
•
Are there pets in your extended family?
•
•
If yes, how many? What species?
•
•
May I have the contact information for your veterinarian?
Three kinds of educational intervention were used. 
Participants enrolled at Primary Care Today were educated 
individually by an investigator or a trained assistant. Those 
attending CME presentations took part in either large group 
lectures or a small group, case-based workshop. All were 
given a brochure highlighting salient points, including 25 ref-
erences. Participants then verbally agreed to ask their patients 
about pets in their families when it was clinically relevant.
Following the educational interventions, monthly emails 
were sent to participants, reinforcing relevant information 
and inviting questions. After 3 to 4 months, they were 
invited to take a final online survey,18 which paralleled the 
baseline survey and asked for comments. Two reminders 
were sent as required. The survey was then closed, and data 
were analyzed.
Binomial outcomes (ie, yes or no answers) were analyzed 
using Fisher’s exact test.19 Differences were deemed statisti-
cally significant if P < .05. Where scores were recorded at 
baseline and at the end of the study, a sign test on the differ-
ence in scores was conducted (SAS). Categorical results (eg, 
frequency of patient discussions on specific topics) were 
converted to an ordinal scale based on the 5 categories, and 
P values were based on the change from baseline. Responses 
to open-ended questions were themed, using conventional 
content analysis.20
Results
The 225 participants in the study represented a variety of 
health care professions, including physicians (120; 53%), 
social workers (30; 13%), nurse practitioners (29; 13%), 
pharmacists (14; 6%) and nurses (14; 6%). Most (147; 65%) 
were educated through individual academic outreach, 64 
(28%) in large group lectures, and 12 (5%) participated in a 
case-based workshop. Ninety-four participants (42%) from 
multiple health care professions completed the study. Current 
pet owners were more frequently represented (P < .05) 
among those who completed the study. Previous pet experi-
ence did not affect the likelihood of study completion.
The type of educational intervention had some impact on 
the completion rate. Ninety-two percent (n = 11) of PHPs 
who participated in the case-based small group workshop 
completed the study, as did 47% (n = 30) of those who 
attended the large group lecture and 36% (n = 53) of PHPs 
educated through individual outreach.
Over the course of the study, PHPs better determined which 
of their patients lived with pets. Their confidence in their esti-
mates of the prevalence of pet ownership among their patients 
increased significantly (P < .01; Table 1). The frequency of 
asking about pets increased significantly (P < .01). “Routinely” 
asking about pets was defined in 2 ways to accommodate the 
usual language of participants’ professions: “when interview-
ing new patients or at periodic health review” and “in every 
nonemergency patient visit.” When the results of both catego-
ries were combined, routinely asking about pets increased sig-
nificantly (P < .01). All PHPs had patients with pets. Their 
patients owned a variety of pets, most notably dogs and cats. 
The patients of most participants (76; 81%) owned more than 
1 species of animal, including small mammals, reptiles, birds, 
and horses.
No PHP reported that patients were reluctant to answer 
questions about pets in the family. Patients were quick to 
answer (45; 48%), revealed more about themselves and 
their pets (66; 70%), and appeared to develop better rap-
port with the PHP (45; 48%). In response, patients pre-
sented clinically relevant information to the PHP. 
 Hodgson et al.

Participants reported that they learned more about their 
patients’ physical activity (78; 83%), about patients’ fam-
ily members and social capital (51; 54%), and about 
patients’ housing (51; 54%). Four participants (4%) 
reported that they learned nothing new about their patients 
when they asked about pets in the family.
Open-ended questions on the final survey asked about 
the impact of asking about pets on PHP’s practice and on 
their relationship with patients. The strongest impact was 
an improved therapeutic alliance with patients (Table 2). 
The final survey invited comments on challenges to asking 
about pets in patients’ families (Table 3). Twenty-seven 
participants (29%) found no challenge to asking about 
pets. The most commonly cited challenge was lack of time 
(n = 20; 21%), with several indicating this was due to 
patients’ enthusiasm for the topic of their pets. Some par-
ticipants found little or no impact on their practice, but 
most found that asking about pets had a positive impact. 
PHPs most frequently mentioned improvement in rapport 
or the therapeutic relationship, identification of an addi-
tional avenue to patient care, and improved understanding 
of the patient. Most found that pet-related discussions with 
patients had a positive impact on their relationship and 
improved provider-patient rapport/therapeutic alliance.

INQUIRY
Asking about pets changed practice behavior (Table 4). 
Participants were significantly able to leverage all categories 
of zooeyia in practice: social capital (P < .05), physical exer-
cise (P < .05), controlling unhealthy behaviors (P < .05), and 
the therapeutic benefits of pets (P < .01). Likewise, they 
were significantly able to mitigate 2 categories of zoonotic 
risk: infectious disease and injury (P < .01). There was no 
significant change in mitigation of the environmental impact 
of pets, nor in their potential challenge to family resources.
Participants were asked about interprofessional collabora-
tion with veterinarians. There was no significant change, 
although several commented that they now would consult a 
veterinarian as clinically appropriate.
Discussion
Asking about pets during patient interviews influenced both 
the quality of communication with patients and the available 
approaches to care. Asking about pets is a universally appli-
cable, universally accepted, and boundary-appropriate way 
to open communication with patients. All participants had 
patients with pets, and all patients responded without objec-
tion. Asking about pets was relevant to all primary care prac-
tices, while not to all patients. It was inoffensive to those 
without pets and encouraged pet owners to talk about their 
daily lives. Asking about pets significantly increased provid-
ers’ knowledge of their patients and how they lived. 
Participants gained important understanding of patients’ 
physical activity, social capital, and housing. Remarkably, 
only 4 PHPs (4%) found that asking about pets revealed 
nothing about patients’ home life. Participants valued this 
increased understanding of patients. Thirty-one percent 
incorporated asking about pets as a matter of routine—a sig-
nificant change in practice.
PHPs who currently owned pets were more likely to 
complete the study. Their familiarity with pets may have 
been a strong motivator. Pet-owning PHPs could effectively 
use pet-related discussions with patients as a boundary-
appropriate way to share aspects of their own lives to no 
detrimental effect.
Two-thirds of participants reported that asking about pets 
had a positive impact on their practice and relationships with 
patients. The strongest effect was improved rapport/thera-
peutic alliance. This is foundational to primary care. 
Participants were able to leverage zooeyia in their care of 
patients. Fifteen percent of participants noted that asking 
about pets opened new avenues to care. The strongest change 
was in incorporating pets into treatment plans. Pets are an 
existing resource to PHPs. Evidence of the impact of pets on 
human health is well established, yet PHPs seldom avail 
themselves of opportunities to activate this family resource. 
Using activities with pets to complement medical therapy is 
readily accepted by patients; their animal companions are 
part of their everyday life.
Discussions with patients about mitigating the risk of zoo-
notic disease and injury increased significantly. Physicians 
generally consider management of zoonotic risk a responsi-
bility of public health services and veterinarians.21 After the 
educational intervention, many PHPs expressed increased 
confidence to work in this area. Dogs and cats were certainly 
the most popular pets in this study, which is consistent with 
national surveys.3 The higher than expected representation of 
horses may indicate participation of rural PHPs. Ownership 
of pocket pets, birds, and reptiles also exceeded published 
reports.3 This underlines the need for understanding how 
each species differs in their impact on owners’ health.22 
There was no change in patient discussions regarding the 
environmental impact of pets. At the outset of the study, 
many PHPs were concerned about pets causing asthma. 
Recent research has revealed that early exposure to pets has 
a protective function against all allergic disease.23-25 
Conversely, relatively few participants were aware of the 
importance of environmental contamination with intestinal 
parasite eggs,26,27 for example, and preventive steps to rec-
ommend to patients. Following the educational intervention, 
PHPs may have recalibrated their assessment of the environ-
mental impact of pets, seeing less risk for their previous con-
cerns and recognizing risks they had not previously 
considered. There was also no change in patient discussions 
around pets’ challenge to family resources (financial, emo-
tional, and social). During the baseline survey and educa-
tional interventions, PHPs often expressed discomfort with 
such topics.
The most frequently identified challenge to asking 
patients about pets is lack of time. People love to talk about 
their pets. Each practitioner must weigh the potential time 
pressure against the value of improved communication and 
rapport with the patient, as well as what clinically relevant 
information may be revealed in pet-centered discussions.
PHPs regularly refer to specialists when it is appropriate to 
patient care, yet interprofessional collaboration with veterinar-
ians remains rare. There have long been calls for collaboration

between PHPs and veterinarians.28,29 This is particularly 
important when patients are immunocompromised; veterinar-
ians are seldom aware of such patient conditions.30 
Veterinarians can provide prevention protocols for infectious 
diseases transmissible from pets. The global One Health initia-
tive is dedicated to improving human, animal, and environ-
mental health. Taking a more One Health approach at the 
community level would improve patient care. Several partici-
pants commented that they were now more comfortable with 
communicating with a patient’s veterinarian and would do so 
when clinically appropriate. This would require the patient’s 
permission.31
Limitations and Next Steps
This study is limited by the sampling bias of participants’ 
self-selection which may not be representative of all PHPs. 
Forty-two percent of participants completed the study. Some 
attrition can be attributed to the 3- to 4-month length of the 
study. Budget restrictions of this pilot study prohibited gath-
ering data on the patients’ perspectives of discussions about 
their pets with their health care providers. Patient input, and 
that of PHP-patient partnerships, is the next step in research-
ing this communication approach.
Conclusions
This project is a first step to answer calls for balanced 
research investigating both the benefits and the risks of pet 
ownership to human health.17 These results are compel-
ling, even though there was a time limitation to this study. 
In its span of 3 to 4 months, most PHPs would not have 
seen all their patients, yet those who engaged made signifi-
cant changes to their practice and approaches to patient 
communication.
PHPs continually seek ways to connect with patients. 
Asking about pets in patients’ families is a patient-centered 
communication strategy which can address determinants of 
health, strengthen the therapeutic alliance, and open new 
avenues to care.
