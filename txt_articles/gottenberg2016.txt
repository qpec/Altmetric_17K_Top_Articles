IMPORTANCE One-third of patients with rheumatoid arthritis show inadequate response to
tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) inhibitors; little guidance on choosing the next treatment exists.
OBJECTIVE To compare the efficacy of a non–
TNF-targeted biologic (non-TNF) vs a second
anti-TNF drug for patients with insufficient response to a TNF inhibitor.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A total of 300 patients (conducted between
2009-2012) with rheumatoid arthritis, with persistent disease activity (disease activity score
in 28 joints–erythrocyte sedimentation rate [DAS28-ESR] � 3.2 [range, 0-9.3]) and an
insufficient response to anti-TNF therapy were included in a 52-week multicenter, pragmatic,
open-label randomized clinical trial. The final follow-up date was in August 2013.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive a non–
TNF-targeted biologic
agent or an anti-TNF that differed from their previous treatment. The choice of the biologic
prescribed within each randomized group was left to the treating clinician.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with
good or moderate response according to the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)
scale at week 24. Secondary outcomes included the EULAR response at weeks 12 and 52;
at weeks 12, 24, and 52; DAS28ESR, low disease activity (DAS28 �3.2), remission
(DAS28 �2.6); serious adverse events; and serious infections.
RESULTS Of the 300 randomized patients (243 [83.2%] women; mean [SD] age, 57.1 [12.2]
years; baseline DAS28-ESR, 5.1 [1.1]), 269 (89.7%) completed the study. At week 24, 101 of
146 patients (69%) in the non-TNF group and 76 (52%) in the second anti-TNF group
achieved a good or moderate EULAR response (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.27-3.37; P = .004, with
imputation of missing data; absolute difference, 17.2%; 95% CI, 6.2% to 28.2%). The
DAS28-ESR was lower in the non-TNF group than in the second anti-TNF group (mean
difference adjusted for baseline differences, −0.43; 95% CI, −0.72 to −0.14; P = .004). At
weeks 24 and 52, more patients in the non-TNF group vs the second anti-TNF group showed
low disease activity (45% vs 28% at week 24; OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.27 to 3.43; P = .004 and
41% vs 23% at week 52; OR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.33 to 3.86; P = .003).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with rheumatoid arthritis previously treated
with anti-TNF drugs but with inadequate primary response, a non-TNF biologic agent was
more effective in achieving a good or moderate disease activity response at 24 weeks than
was the second anti-TNF medication.

T
umor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) inhibitors have im-
proved the quality of life for patients with rheumatoid
arthritis who show insufficient response to
methotrexate.1However,asmanyasone-thirdofpatients2,3have
persistent disease activity and insufficient (inadequate) re-
sponse to anti-TNF agents according to international
recommendations.4 Therefore, alternatives are needed.
Switching to a non–TNF-targeted therapy can be an ac-
ceptable strategy, as was reported in 3 placebo-controlled
trials.5-7Themostfrequentlyusednon-TNFbiologicsareabata-
cept, an inhibitor of T-cell costimulation; rituximab, a β-cell–
depleting agent; and tocilizumab, an inhibitor of interleukin
6 (IL-6) receptor. Tofacitinib could also be an option8 but has
not been approved in most European countries, including
France.Cyclingtoasecondanti-TNFagentafterfailureofafirst
anti-TNFagentisareasonablealternative.Themolecularstruc-
ture of TNF inhibitors (adalimumab, certolizumab, etaner-
cept, golimumab, and infliximab) and their affinity for mem-
brane and soluble TNF-α differ. Etanercept targets TNF as well
as lymphotoxin-α. In addition, loss of efficacy to monoclonal
antibodies might result from the secretion of antidrug
antibodies.9Therefore,thelackofefficacyofoneanti-TNFdrug
does not preclude the potential efficacy of another. Two ran-
domized placebo-controlled trials reported that approxi-
mately half of patients with rheumatoid arthritis with insuf-
ficient response to a TNF-α inhibitor responded to a second
anti-TNF drug.10,11
Four observational studies compared a non-TNF biologic
vs a second anti-TNF agent in patients with rheumatoid ar-
thritiswithinsufficientresponsetoaTNF-αinhibitor.12-15How-
ever, no randomized controlled trial has compared the 2 strat-
egies in such patients.
Therefore, the Rotation or Change (ROC) trial was de-
signed to compare the efficacy of 2 therapeutic strategies in
patientswithrheumatoidarthritisafteraninitialanti-TNFagent
failed to reduce their symptoms: a non–TNF-targeted bio-
logic or a second anti-TNF agent.
Methods
Design
The ROC trial was a 52-week pragmatic, multicenter, open,
parallel-group, randomized clinical trial with a superiority de-
sign. Patients with insufficient response to an anti-TNF drug
were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive a non–TNF-
targeted biologic or a second anti-TNF agent. Patients were re-
cruited from December 2009 to August 2012 (Trial Protocol
Supplement 1).
Ethics
The trial was approved by the institutional review board of the
Comité de Protection des Personnes-Est 1, Strasbourg, France.
The study was conducted according to the current regula-
tions of the International Conference on Harmonization guide-
lines and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All pa-
tients gave written informed consent after receiving oral and
written information about the trial.
Randomization
A computer-generated list (random permuted block design
using block sizes of 2, 4, or 6, randomly selected with equal
probability)wasgeneratedbyanindependentstatistician.Con-
cealed allocation of treatments involved a web-based system
that confirmed eligibility criteria before issuing a treatment as-
signment.
Patients
From December 2009 to August 2012, patients who were at
least 18 years old were recruited from 47 French clinical cen-
ters belonging to the Club des Rhumatismes et Inflammation
(a section of the French Society of Rheumatology)–IMIDIATE
Clinical Research Network. To meet the inclusion criteria
patients needed to have (1) a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthri-
tis according to the 1987 American College of Rheumatology
criteria; (2) presence of erosions; (3) a disease activity score in
28 joints–erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) of 3.2
or more (DAS28-ESR is a composite score that ranges from
0-9.3 by taking into account the number of tender joints
[range, 0-28], number of swollen joints [range, 0-28], patient
global assessment of disease activity [numeric analog scale
range, 0-10, with 0 representing the best and 10 the worst],
and the ESR); (4) insufficient response to anti-TNF according
to the physician, who usually considers the response to be
insufficient (inadequate) with one or several of the following
conditions: persistent tender and swollen joints, persistent
disease activity according to patient global assessment,
elevated levels of acute-phase reactants, and dependence on
analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or cortico-
steroids. International recommendations state that a DAS28-
ESR score greater than 3.2 indicates insufficient control
of disease activity and justifies changing the rheumatoid
arthritis treatment4; (5) stable dose of oral corticosteroids
of 15 mg/d or less of equivalent prednisone within 4 weeks
before enrollment; (6) stable dose of synthetic disease-
modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) within 4 weeks of
enrollment; and (7) informed written consent.
Theexclusioncriteriawerediscontinuationofthefirstanti-
TNF agent due to an adverse event only; previous treatment

Key Points
Question For patients with rheumatoid arthritis and an
inadequate response to an anti–tumor necrosis factor (TNF) drug,
is a non–
TNF-targeted biologic drug more effective than a second
anti-TNF drug?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial involving 300 adults,
69% of patients achieved an effective clinical response
with a non-TNF biologic vs 52% of patients who took
a second anti-TNF drug.
Meaning For patients with rheumatoid arthritis and an
insufficient response to anti-TNF therapy, a non-TNF biologic agent
may be more effective than a second anti-TNF drug.

Interventions
Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a non-TNF
biologic (ie, abatacept, rituximab, or tocilizumab) or a second
anti-TNF agent (adalimumab, certolizumab, etanercept, in-
fliximab, or golimumab). The choice of the biologic pre-
scribed within each randomized group was left to the treat-
ing clinician. The initial dose and frequency of treatment were
defined for each drug as follows. In the non-TNF group, the
biologic could be abatacept (500 to 1000 mg intravenously,
dosed according to the patient’
s weight, every 14 days until
week 4 and once monthly thereafter), rituximab (1-g infusion
intravenously followed by another 2 weeks later), or tocili-
zumab (8 mg/kg monthly, intravenously).
Patients receiving an anti-TNF that differed from their
initial treatment could receive adalimumab (40 mg subcuta-
neously every 14 days), certolizumab (400 mg subcutane-
ously every 14 days until week 4, then 200 mg every 14 days),
etanercept (50 mg subcutaneously every 7 days), or inflixi-
mab (3 mg/kg intravenously initially, with the possibility of
ascending doses at weeks 2 and 6 and every 8 weeks thereaf-
ter). A fifth anti-TNF agent, golimumab, was not available at
the time of the study. According to the marketing authoriza-
tion, the choice of subsequent dose and frequency adjust-
ment of the treatment was left to the treating physician in
both groups. The assigned treatment had to be continued for
12 months within the study protocol but could be discontin-
ued for inefficacy, for adverse events, or by patient choice.
Dose adjustments of oral corticosteroids and glucocorticoid
intra-articular injections were allowed for both groups.
End Points
The primary end point was the proportion at week 24 of pa-
tientswithagoodormoderateEuropeanLeagueAgainstRheu-
matism (EULAR) response.16 A good EULAR response is de-
fined as a decrease in DAS28-ESR of more than 1.2 points,
resulting in a score of 3.2 or less. A moderate EULAR response
isdefinedasadecreaseofmorethan0.6andresultinginascore
of 5.1 points or lower.16 Twenty-four weeks was chosen for the
primary end point to ensure that changes in disease activity
were due to the initially assigned biologic treatment. Be-
cause clinicians evaluate therapeutic response and safety
within 24 weeks of drug initiation and change treatments in
caseofinsufficientresponseorseriousadverseevent,thestudy
duration was 52 weeks to allow the evaluation of longer-term
end points, such as therapeutic maintenance.
Prespecified secondary end points included the EULAR
response at weeks 12 and 52; DAS28-ESR at weeks 12, 24, and
52; low disease activity (DAS28-ESR<3.2) and remission
(DAS28-ESR<2.6) at weeks 12, 24, and 52; mean oral cortico-
steroid use at weeks 24 and 52; therapeutic maintenance
(defined as the proportion of patients who did not discon-
tinue the assigned biologic treatment) at weeks 24 and 52;
and health assessment questionnaire17 (HAQ) score (range,
0-3, with 0 representing the best and 3 the worst outcomes)
at weeks 12, 24, and 52. Structural radiographic progression,
initially listed in the protocol, was not available for half of the
recruited patients and was not analyzed or reported herein.
Safety was evaluated throughout the study. Serious ad-
verse events were defined as life-threatening or resulting in
death, hospitalization, or persistent disability. Serious infec-
tions were defined as requiring intravenous antibiotics, or re-
sulting in hospitalization, or in death.
Statistical Analysis
Among patients with insufficient response to a TNF-α inhibi-
tor, the EULAR response was approximately 50% in one
placebo-controlled study of a second anti-TNF (golimumab)10
and 66% in 2 placebo-controlled studies of rituximab5
and tocilizumab.6 Therefore, we assumed that 50% of pa-
tients with insufficient response to anti-TNF therapy would
respond to a second anti-TNF agent and that 66% would
respond to a non–TNF-targeted biologic. We hypothesized an
absolute increase of 16% in EULAR response (ie, odds ratio
[OR], 1.94) in the non–TNF-targeted group, with an α risk of
.05 and a β risk of .20. This hypothesis required randomizing
300 patients (150 patients per group).
Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. In case
of missing data for the primary end point, we decided, before
the study data were made available to the statistical team, to
use multiple imputation by chained equation with m = 50 im-
putations instead of a last-observation-carried-forward ap-
proach, as specified in the initial protocol. Since the protocol
was written, multiple imputation has become widely ac-
cepted as a vastly superior method to the last-observation-
carried-forward approach.18 Given the low number of miss-
ing data and the fact that they were well balanced, secondary
end points were not imputed. For mixed models of longitudi-
nal data, multiple imputation has been shown to not improve
the results and a mixed model for imputed data could some-
timesleadtounstableresults.19Duringfollow-up,patientswho
received any biologic agent different from the treatment ini-
tiallyassigned,foranyreason,werecontinuedinthestudyand
were considered nonresponders.
Categorical variables are described with frequencies and
percentages and quantitative variables with mean (SD) or, for
data that did not have normal distribution, median (interquar-
tile range [IQR] percentile). Mixed logistic regression models
were used to assess differences between the 2 groups for cat-
egorical variables at weeks 12, 24, and 52 with a random ef-
fect on each center to account for the potential correlation be-
tween centers. To assess mean differences between groups at
weeks12,24,and52,weusedaconstrainedlongitudinalanaly-
sis with random effects on patient and center. In this model,
both the baseline and postbaseline values were modeled as de-
pendent variables and the true baseline means were con-
strained to be the same for the 2 treatment groups. Hence, this
analysis provides an adjustment for the observed baseline dif-
ference in estimating the treatment. If the hypotheses for the
mixed model were not satisfied, nonparametric analysis was
used; differences between week 0 and the week of interest be-
tween the 2 groups were compared by Wilcoxon test.
A comparison of the primary end point between the 3
biologics in the non–TNF-targeted group was also performed.

To handle the fact that the choice of the biologic prescribed
was left to the clinician (and not randomized), inverse prob-
ability weighting was used; each observation was weighted
by the inverse of the predicted probability of receiving the
biologic prescribed (abatacept, rituximab, or tocilizumab) for
each patient. Therapeutic maintenance was analyzed by
Kaplan-Meier curves and compared with a marginal
Cox model to take into account the center effect. All sta-
tistical tests were 2-sided with P values <.05 considered sta-
tistically significant. Statistical analysis involved use of
R 3.0.1 (http://www.R-project.org, the R Foundation for
Statistical Computing).
Results
Baseline Characteristics of Patients
FromDecember2009toAugust2012,300patients(150ineach
group) were randomized; 7 patients withdrew their consent for
use of data and 1 patient did not meet inclusion criteria and
was wrongly included. The final follow-up testing was in Au-
gust 2013. On-site monitoring of all patients in all 47 centers
was completed in February 2015. Overall, data for 146 pa-
tients in each group could be analyzed; 144 and 141 patients
received the allocated intervention in the non–TNF-targeted
and second anti-TNF groups, respectively (Figure 1). The 2
groups were not different in demographic and disease char-
acteristics, such as sex, age, disease duration, rheumatoid fac-
tor, and anticyclic citrullinated peptide positivity, number of
previous synthetic DMARDs taken, baseline DAS28-ESR, and
HAQ score (Table 1).
Treatments Received
In the non-TNF group, 33 of 146 patients (23%) received
abatacept;41(28%)rituximab,and70(48%),tocilizumab.Two
patients (1%) did not receive the intervention as allocated;
1 patient received adalimumab and 1 patient received no treat-
ment. In the second anti-TNF group, 57 of 146 patients (39%)
receivedadalimumab;23(16%),certolizumab,53(36%),etaner-
cept; and 8 (5%), infliximab. Five patients (3%) did not re-
ceive the intervention as allocated; 2 patients received ritux-
imab, 1 patient received tocilizumab, and 2 patients received
no treatment. At enrollment, 112 patients (77%) in each group
received a concomitant synthetic DMARD: 95 patients (65%)
in the non-TNF group and 88 (60%) in the second anti-TNF
group concomitantly received methotrexate; and 80 (55%) in
the non-TNF group received a mean (SD) dose of 7.3 (2.9) mg/d
and 75 (51%) in the second anti-TNF group received 7.2
(3.1) mg/d of oral corticosteroids.
At week 24, 104 of 140 patients (74%) in the non-TNF
group and 112 of 141 patients (79%) in the second anti-TNF
group concomitantly received a synthetic DMARD, includ-
ing 89 (63.6%) in the non-TNF group and 88 (62.4%) in the
second anti-TNF group who received methotrexate. At week
24, 79 of 142 patients (56%) in the non-TNF group concomi-
tantly received a mean (SD) dose of 6.81 (4.26) mg/d of pred-
nisone and 79 of 141 patients (56%) in the second anti-TNF
group 6.69 (2.93) mg/d.
At week 52, 98 of 132 patients (74%) in the non-TNF
group concomitantly received a synthetic DMARD, includ-
ing 84 (64%) who received methotrexate, and 106 of 130

The analytic sample sizes shown at baseline in Figure 2 differ from the total
number randomized because of missing data. They also differ for DAS28-ESR
from the numbers included in the primary analysis (European League
Against Rheumatism response) because in the primary analysis, some of the
patients with missing data were considered nonresponders because they
received during the follow-up a biologic agent different from the treatment
initially assigned, as specified in the statistical analysis section. Constrained
longitudinal data analyses were used for between-group comparisons for
DAS28-ESR and HAQ. For DAS-28-ESR, the 12-week P value was .008;
24- week, P = .004; and 52-week, P = .01; for HAQ, the 12-week P value
was.09; 24-week, P = .44; and 52-week, P = .75. Data markers represent the
mean and error bars 95% CIs. See the Methods section for a definition of dis-
ease activity score in 28 joints-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR)
and range and the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) definition and

a A good EULAR response is a decrease in DAS28-ESR by more than 1.2 points
and resulting in a DAS28 of 3.2 or less. A moderate EULAR response is a
decrease in DAS-ESR of more than 0.6 points and resulting in a DAS28
of 5.1 or less. (See the Methods section for definition of DAS28-ESR.) We
imputed missing values only when indicated for the primary outcome. All the
other results presented in the Table and in the manuscript consistently use
data for completers, without imputation.

showed low disease activity with a DAS28-ESR of less than 3.2
(OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.27-3.43; P = .004). At week 52, 53 of 130
patients (41%) in the non-TNF group vs 31 of 133 patients (23%)
in the anti-TNF group showed low disease activity (OR, 2.26;
95% CI, 1.33-3.86; P = .003).
At week 12, 28 of 137 patients (20%) in the non-TNF
group vs 13 patients of 135 (10%) in the second anti-TNF
group showed DAS28-ESR remission with a score of 2.6 or
less (OR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.19; 4.89; P = .02). At week 52, 35 of
130 patients (27%) in the non-TNF group vs 18 of 133 (14%)
in the second anti-TNF group had a DAS28-ESR remission
(OR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.25-4.43; P = .008) (Table 2).
The health assessment questionnaire scores did not dif-
fer between the 2 groups: the mean difference adjusted for
baselinedifferenceatweek12was−0.09(95%CI,−0.20to0.01;
P = .09); week 24, −0.04 (95% CI, −0.15 to 0.07; P = .44), and
week 52, −0.02 (95% CI, −0.13 to 0.09; P = .75).
At week 24, the median change from baseline in eryth-
rocyte sediment rate was −10 (interquartile range [IQR], −28
to −1) in the non-TNF group vs −2 (IQR, −13 to 3) in the sec-
ond anti-TNF group (P < .001). The median change in
C-reactive protein (CRP) level was −3 (IQR, −18 to 0) in the
non-TNF group vs −2 (IQR, −10 to −1) in the second anti-TNF
group (P = .06).
The proportion of EULAR good and moderate responders
at week 24 did not significantly differ with abatacept, ritux-
imab, and tocilizumab treatment: 67% (22 of 33) of patients,
61% (25 of 41) of patients, and 80% (56 of 70) of patients, re-
spectively (OR tocilizumab vs abatacept, 1.78; 95% CI, 0.59-
5.37; P = .30; OR tocilizumab vs rituximab, 2.47; 95% CI, 0.92
to 6.62; P = .07).
Twenty-seven patients (18%) in the non-TNF group and
48 (33%) in the anti-TNF group (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.27 to
0.79) started a new biologic. In the non-TNF group 14
patients did so because of inefficacy; 12, adverse events, and
1, unknown reasons. In the second anti-TNF group, 40
patients did so because of inefficacy; 6, adverse events; 1,
desire to become pregnant; and 1, unknown reasons. At the
time of discontinuation, the mean (SD) DAS28-ESR was 4.54
(1.90) in the non-TNF group and 5.25 (1.17) in second anti-
TNF, 2 in each group had missing data. The therapeutic main-
tenance rate, defined as the proportion of patients who con-
tinued the biologic treatment as initially assigned, was
significantly higher at weeks 24 and 52 in the non-TNF group
than in the second anti-TNF group (eFigure in Supplement 2).
The mean change from baseline to weeks 24 and 52 in the
level of prednisone doses were not significantly different
between patients between treatment groups. The mean dif-
ference in the level of prednisone doses at week 24 was −0.16
(95% CI, −1.11 to 0.79; P = .74) and was −0.02 (95%, CI −1.01
to 0.97; P = .97) at week 52.
Safety
Sixteen patients (11%) in the non-TNF experienced 18 serious
adverse events, and 8 patients (5%) in the second anti-TNF
group experienced 13 events (P = .10). Seven patients (5%) in
each group developed serious infections (Table 3). One case
of tuberculosis occurred in the second anti-TNF group. Six car-
diovascular events occurred in the non-TNF group: tachycar-
dia occurred in 1 patient receiving abatacept and 1 receiving
tocilizumab; stroke, in 1 patient receiving rituximab and 1 re-
ceiving tocilizumab; and 2 episodes of limb ischemia, in 1 pa-
tient receiving rituximab. One cardiovascular event occurred
in the second anti-TNF group, hypertensive crisis in a patient
receiving certolizumab. One patient in the non-TNF group re-
ceiving abatacept died of complications stemming from a dis-
section of an aortic aneurysm.
Discussion
This pragmatic, multicenter, open-label, parallel-group, ran-
domized clinical trial addressed the optimal therapeutic strat-
egy for patients with rheumatoid arthritis and insufficient re-
sponse to a first anti-TNF drug. The proportion of EULAR
response at week 24, the primary end point of the study, was
greater among those treated with a non–TNF-targeted bio-
logic than those treated with a second anti-TNF biologic.

The results of the ROC study demonstrate in a pragmatic
clinical trial that approximately 50% of patients with insuffi-
cient response to a TNF-α inhibitor might respond to a sec-
ondanti-TNFagent.However,atherapeuticresponsewasmore
frequent with non–TNF-targeted biologics. In addition to the
superiority of the non-TNF treatment for the primary out-
come at week 24, the non-TNF treatment was associated with
a better EULAR response than a second anti-TNF drug at weeks
12 and 52. Consistent with these findings, the DAS28-ESR and
proportion of patients achieving low disease activity status
were greater at months 6 and 12 than in the non-TNF group in
the second anti-TNF group.
Tocilizumab is the only drug with a direct effect on CRP
levels due to inhibition of IL-6, independent of clinical re-
sponse. Of note, the 2 groups did not differ in changes in their
CRP levels. Thus, the differences in the primary and most of
the secondary outcomes were not likely to be due to the bio-
logical effect of tocilizumab.
Themainstrengthofthestudyisitspragmaticdesign.Phy-
sicianscommonlychooseonedrugratherthananotherformul-
tiple reasons (habits, characteristics of patients). We chose to
compare strategies instead of individual drug prescriptions be-
cause this issue corresponds to the therapeutic question cli-
nicians face in daily practice. Therefore, the choice of the bio-
logic within each randomized group and the concomitant
synthetic DMARDs was left to the clinicians.
Thestudyalsohasseverallimitations.First,aprimarylimi-
tation is the lack of blinding of participants. However, in this
trial including multiple biologics, a blinded design could not
beeasilyperformedgiventhenumberofdifferentplacebosthat
would have been needed. Second, some biologic agents were
not allowed (eg, golimumab because this drug was not mar-
keted in France at the time of enrollment in the study or
anakinra because this drug is less frequently used than other
biologics to treat rheumatoid arthritis). Third, the study was
not powered to compare the safety profile of non–TNF-
targeted drugs and anti-TNF agents or to detect differences be-
tweenindividualdrugs.Therefore,noconclusionscanbemade
regardingindividualdrugefficacy.Fourth,approximately40%
of patients in each group did not receive concomitant treat-
ment with methotrexate. Methotrexate improves the clinical
efficacy of most biologics, with tocilizumab perhaps the least
likely to benefit from its concomitant use. Fifth, treatment ad-
herence might have differed between the 2 groups because all
non-TNF drugs were given as infusions under observation,
whereas most of the anti-TNF drugs (except infliximab) were
self-injected by patients.
Conclusions
Among patients with rheumatoid arthritis previously treated
with anti-TNF drugs but considered for a second medication
due to inadequate primary response, a non-TNF biologic agent
was more effective in achieving a good or moderate disease
activityresponseat24weeks.However,asecondanti-TNFdrug
to treat these patients was often effective in producing a clini-
cal improvement.
