ABSTRACT
Transendocardial stem cell injection in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) improves left
ventricular function and structure but has ill-defined effects on ventricular arrhythmias. We
hypothesized that mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) implantation is not proarrhythmic. Post hoc anal-
yses were performed on ambulatory ECGs collected from the POSEIDON and TAC-HFT trials. Eighty-
eight subjects (mean age 61 6 10 years) with ICM (mean EF 32.2% 6 9.8%) received treatment
with MSC (n 5 48), Placebo (n 5 21), or bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMC) (n 5 19). Heart rate
variability (HRV) and ventricular ectopy (VE) were evaluated over 12 months. VE did not change in
any group following MSC implantation. However, in patients with � 1 VE run (defined as � 3 con-
secutive premature ventricular complexes in 24 hours) at baseline, there was a decrease in VE runs
at 12 months in the MSC group (p 5 .01), but not in the placebo group (p 5 .07; intergroup compar-
ison: p 5 .18). In a subset of the MSC group, HRV measures of standard deviation of normal inter-
vals was 75 6 30 msec at baseline and increased to 87 6 32 msec (p 5.02) at 12 months, and root
mean square of intervals between successive complexes was 36 6 30 msec and increased to
58.2 6 50 msec (p 5 .01) at 12 months. In patients receiving MSCs, there was no evidence for ven-
tricular proarrhythmia, manifested by sustained or nonsustained ventricular ectopy or worsened
HRV. Signals of improvement in ventricular arrhythmias and HRV in the MSC group suggest a need
for further studies of the antiarrhythmic potential of MSCs. STEM CELLS TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
Our study is a novel post hoc analysis which examines potential pro- and anti-arrhythmic effects
from transendocardial injection of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in patients with ischemic car-
diomyopathy. By combining patient populations from two prospective, randomized controlled
trials (POSEIDON and TAC-HFT) and examining ventricular ectopy and heart rate variability, we
were able to study a group of patients who received MSCs and compared them to groups who
received placebo and bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells. The safety and efficacy of stem
cell implantation has been explored in prior studies, but the potential arrhythmogenicity of this
MSC therapy and how it compares to placebo injections have not previously been studied on
this scale. Our study did not show any pro-arrhythmia with MSC implantation, though there
were important trends demonstrated between improvement of arrhythmias and this stem cell
population in comparison to placebo or bone marrow derived mononuclear cells. These findings
are important in that they beg the need for further large prospective studies to evaluate the
anti-arrhythmic potential of mesenchymal and other newer cell-based therapies.
INTRODUCTION
Heart failure remains an epidemic with prevalence
rates estimated between 0.4 and 2% in Europe
and the U.S. [1]. Based on recent projections, the
prevalence of heart failure is expected to increase
from approximately 6 million to > 8 million Amer-
icans by 2030 [2].Transendocardial stem cell injec-
tion (TESI) is a novel regenerative therapy with
promising results for these patients [3–7].

TISSUE-SPECIFIC PROGENITOR AND STEM CELLS
 Randomized controlled studies have demonstrated improve-
ment in structural and hemodynamic parameters using different
delivery strategies for a variety of cell types [4–8]. Patients with
ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) are at risk for sudden cardiac
death [9]. Although an increasing proportion of cardiac arrests are
being attributed to asystole and pulseless electrical activity, ven-
tricular tachycardia (VT), and ventricular fibrillation (VF) lead to
cardiac arrest in a substantial number of cases [10–12]. Structural
risk factors for VT/VF include myocardial scar size, left ventricular
ejection fraction, and chamber volume [13]. Other prognostic risk
factors for VT/VF and sudden cardiac death include but are not
limited to frequent ventricular ectopy, nonsustained VT, prolonga-
tion of QT interval, increase in QT dispersion, and abnormal heart
rate variability [9, 11, 14]. It is unknown whether TESI of bone
marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) mitigate, exacer-
bate, or do not affect ventricular arrhythmias. If stem cells estab-
lish areas of heterogeneous conduction and repolarization upon
injection, the therapy might potentially be proarrhythmic [15–17].
Prior studies in humans have shown lack of proarrhythmia [18,
19]; however, these studies used bone marrow cells.
Our hypotheses were that MSC implantation was not associ-
ated with an increase in ventricular ectopy (VE) nor worsening of
an important marker of ventricular arrhythmias such as heart rate
variability (HRV). A secondary objective was to determine whether
there were any signals of antiarrhythmic effect from MSC implant
in the heart.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
POSEIDON (A Phase I/II, Randomized Pilot Study of the Compar-
ative Safety and Efficacy of Transendocardial Injection of Autolo-
gous Mesenchymal Stem Cells Versus Allogeneic Mesenchymal
Stem Cells in Patients With Chronic Ischemic Left Ventricular
Dysfunction Secondary to Myocardial Infarction) and TAC-HFT
(Transendocardial Autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cells and
Mononuclear Bone Marrow Cells in Ischemic Heart Failure Trial)
were Phase I/II transendocardial MSC trials performed in
patients with ICM [5, 6]. Post hoc analyses of the combined
datasets and ambulatory ECG monitors from these trials were
performed. In the POSEIDON study, 31 patients were enrolled at
the University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine (Miami, Flor-
ida) and the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (Balti-
more, Maryland) between April 2, 2010 and September 14,
2011. In TAC-HFT, 59 patients were randomized at the University
of Miami from September 1, 2009 to July 12, 2013. All patients
provided written informed consent for the Institutional Review
Board-approved protocols. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood
Institute Gene and Cell Therapy Data and Safety Monitoring
Board, local Institutional Review Boards, and the POSEIDON and
TAC-HFT research groups were each responsible for the safety
and protection of the participating patients.
The enrollment criteria for either trial included LV dysfunction
(ejection fraction < 50%) and history of ICM. Exclusion criteria
included limited life expectancy (< 1 year), glomerular filtration
rate of less than 50 ml/min/1.73 m2, serious radiographic contrast
allergy, clinical requirement for coronary revascularization, history
of a life-threatening arrhythmia in the absence of an implanted
defibrillator, or recent sustained ventricular arrhythmias requiring
defibrillator therapy. Patients with persistent atrial fibrillation
were also excluded.
In POSEIDON, patients were randomized to injections of vari-
ous doses (20, 100, 200 million cells) of allogeneic or autologous
bone marrow-derived MSCs. In the TAC-HFT study, patients were
randomly assigned into 3 groups: autologous bone marrow mono-
nuclear cells (BMCs), bone marrow-derived autologous MSCs (200
million cells), or placebo.The stem cells or placebo were delivered
by transendocardial injection to 10 sites in the border zone of
infarcted myocardial territory as previously described [5, 6, 20]. In
this post hoc analysis, 29 patients from the POSEIDON trial were
combined with the autologous MSC group of TAC-HFT (19
patients) to create 3 groups: MSC (n5 48), Placebo (n 5 21), and
BMC (n 5 19). Patients in both trials had been optimized in terms
of evidence-based medical and device therapy. One of the
patients from the POSEIDON trial was excluded from this analysis

 because the patient had an intraventricular thrombus and thus
never received any stem cell therapy. Another patient from POSEI-
DON was excluded as the raw data from the Johns Hopkins Uni-
versity were not available.
Patients underwent 24 to 48 hours ambulatory ECG monitor-
ing at baseline after achieving optimal medical therapy, 4 continu-
ous days after injection, 2 weeks post-injection, monthly up to 6
months, and at 12 months of follow-up. The ECG recordings were
downloaded and analyzed using the Impresario Holter Analysis
System by Del Mar Reynolds Medical, Inc. (Copyright 2001). Two
cardiologists from the University of Miami Health System verified
all tracings by visual inspection for accuracy of software interpre-
tation of paced beats, ectopic beats, and artifact. A separate third
cardiologist (R.D.M.) adjudicated any differences in rhythm inter-
pretation between the first two readers.
HRV analysis was performed solely on patients from the POS-
EIDON trial, as raw data from the Impresario Holter System were
available only in these patients. Of the 31 patients who were origi-
nally enrolled in the POSEIDON trial, 1 patient was excluded due
to a left ventricular thrombus, and 6 were excluded due to
unavailability of raw data. Predominant atrial pacing in 2 subjects
and excessive noise/artifact in 1 subject precluded accurate HRV
analysis. Therefore, 21 patients with complete and authenticated
monitoring data were included in the HRV analysis. The ambula-
tory ECGs were analyzed utilizing the Impresario software for HRV
parameters, focusing on the following time domain methods [21]:
(a) SDNN—the standard deviation of all normal sinus R-R intervals,
and (b) RMSSD—the root mean square of the difference between
coupling intervals of adjacent R-R intervals.
The indices of HRV were compared with functional and ana-
tomic markers, such as ejection fraction, end-diastolic volume,
end-systolic volume, and sphericity index [5]. Contrast-enhanced
CT scanning was used to assess global LV function and volumes.
An arbitrary cutoff of significant change was assigned as any
increase in ejection fraction, 5% decrease in end-diastolic volume,
5% decrease in end-systolic volume, and 10% decrease in spheric-
ity index. Improvement of HRV between groups with functional
and anatomic improvement compared to those without improve-
ment was then analyzed.
Eighty-eight patients with usable ambulatory ECG monitors
were included in VE analysis. We defined VE as the number of
premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) recorded by an auto-
mated counter and normalized to a 24-hour period. A VE run
was defined as three or more consecutive PVCs. A subgroup
analysis of patients with greater than or equal to 1 VE run in a
24-hour period was also performed. Both POSEIDON and TAC-
HFT showed a significant decrease in scar size at 12-month fol-
low-up in the MSC group, respectively, which may be related to
change in VE [5, 6]. Thus, the percent change in scar size was
analyzed for the Placebo, BMC, and combined MSC groups.
Patients without baseline or 12-month data for scar size or ven-
tricular ectopy were excluded from this analysis, yielding a total
of 69 patients for comparison—15 patients who received Pla-
cebo, 13 patients who received BMCs, and 41 patients who
received MSCs from both the POSEIDON and TAC-HFT studies.
The percent change in scar size was compared to the percent
change in ventricular ectopy from baseline to 12 months for all
patients, and linear regression analysis was used for each group.
The autologous and allogeneic MSC groups were combined for
HRV analysis. The data for HRV were represented using means and
standard deviations. Determination of statistical significance was

 performed using Student’s t tests and repeated measures ANOVA.
p values less than .05 were considered significant. Because of the
large variability within the ventricular ectopy data over several
orders of magnitude between patients, logarithmic transformation
was utilized in an effort to normalize the data. However, as the
data remained skewed post-transformation, medians and IQR were
used to summarize the nonparametric distributions. ANOVA and v2
tests were used to determine differences in baseline characteristics
between the 3 groups (MSC, BMC, placebo). Wilcoxon Signed Rank
tests were used to determine statistical significance of change in
ventricular ectopy from baseline to 12-month follow up, and Krus-
kal–Wallis tests were used for intergroup comparisons.
RESULTS
Eighty-eight patients (mean age 60.9 6 9.9 years) with ICM (mean
ejection fraction (EF) 32.2% 6 9.8%) from the POSEIDON and TAC-
HFT trials were included in our post hoc analysis. There were no
differences in baseline gender, age, ejection fraction, mean heart
rate, or use of antiarrhythmic drugs (Table 1). However, at base-
line the BMC group had lower median VE per day at baseline
(median 2.2, IQR [1.5–2.6]; p 5 .01), and the MSC group had
higher median VE runs at baseline (median 0.5, IQR [0.0–1.5];
p 5 .02). No patients had ICD shocks and/or clinical VT events
within 30 days prior to the implant procedure.
There were two deaths, both of them attributable to sudden
death. One patient had received MSCs, also had severe COPD and
recent pneumonia and had presented with acute respiratory dis-
tress prior to PEA arrest. The other patient had been in the pla-
cebo group and died suddenly at home. There were appropriate
ICD shocks for ventricular tachyarrhythmias in 4 patients and an
inappropriate ICD shock in 1 patient for atrial fibrillation: 3 (16%)
of the patients in the BMC group were shocked compared with 1
patient (2.1%) in the MSC group, and 1 (4.8%) patient in the pla-
cebo group (p 5 .08 comparing ICD shocks between BMC and
MSC group; NS between all other groups). During the actual
implant procedure, an additional 1 patient had an episode of VT

Change in high-burden ventricular ectopy runs (�1 VE Run/24 hours) over 12 months. In a subgroup analysis of patients with� 1 VE
Run in a 24-hour period, there was a significant decrease from baseline to 12 months in the MSC group, but not in the placebo group (p 5 .01).
The BMC group was excluded due to an insufficient number of runs for comparison. Of note, an intergroup comparison between the placebo
and MSC groups did not reach statistical significance with p 5 .18. The baseline to 12-month analysis within each group was performed using Wil-
coxon Signed-Rank tests, and the Kruskal–Wallis test was used for intergroup comparison. Abbreviation: MSC, mesenchymal stem cell.

 requiring cardioversion which was attributed to nonspecific
response to catheter manipulation within the left ventricle.
At baseline, the BMC group had lower median log VE/24
hours compared with the other groups (Table 2; p5 .01). Never-
theless, there was no significant short-term increase or decrease
in ventricular ectopy in any group (Fig. 1) within the first 3 days of
implantation. There was also no significant change in ventricular
ectopy between baseline and 1-year follow-up in any group. In
the MSC group, log VE/24 hours at baseline was a median of 3.0
[2.3–3.4] and at one year was a median of 2.5 [2.0–3.1; p 5 .25].
In the subgroup analysis of patients with �1 VE runs demon-
strated a decrease from 2.0 [1.0–10.8] runs to 0.5 [0.0–3.8] runs
in the MSC group (p50.01) and no significant change in the pla-
cebo group (1.8 [1.5–2.1] to 1.0 [0.8–1.0] p 5 .07; intergroup com-
parison: p 5 .18) (Fig. 2). An insufficient number of patients with
�1 VE runs in the BMC group precluded analysis.
In the HRV analysis with a total of 21 patients, mean baseline
heart rate was 766 8.2/minute and did not change at 12 months
(74 6 8.2/minute; p5 .30). However, mean SDNN was 756 30
msec and increased by 16% to 876 32 msec after 12 months
(p 5 .024). Mean RMSSD was 36.3 6 30 msec at baseline and
increased by 60% to 58.2 6 50 msec at 12 months (p 5 .014) (Fig.
3). The increases in SDNN and RMSSD were observed in the sub-
group of patients with any increase in EF (Table 3). Furthermore,
improvement in RMSSD was also significantly associated in sub-
groups of patients with decrease in end diastolic volume and
sphericity index (Table 3).
Scar mass decreased in the MSC group by 33.1% (95% CI,
240.7% to 225.5%) compared with 23.1% (95% CI, 236.4% to
29.7%) in the BMC group and 15.3% (95% CI, 229.3% to 21.3%)
in the placebo group at 12 months (intergroup comparison
p 5 .03; MSC vs. Placebo p 5 .02; MSC vs. BMC p 5 .08). There
was a significant correlation of percentage change in scar size to
percentage change in ventricular ectopy in the MSC group
(R2 5 .17, p5 .01) whereas there was no correlation found in the
BMC group (R2 5 .07, p 5 .38) or in the Placebo group (R25 .03,
p 5 .56) (Fig. 4).
DISCUSSION
The main finding from this study is that TESI with MSCs was not
associated with short-term or long-term ventricular proarrhythmia
among ICM patients. Moreover, we identified signals for potential
antiarrhythmic effect or at least improvement in risk factors for
ventricular arrhythmias in the patients who had MSC injection. In
the BMC and placebo groups, no similar signal for improvement
was noted.
Cell-based therapies for cardiac repair have progressed from
proof of concept to randomized clinical trials demonstrating signif-
icant left ventricular improvement. The recently published ixCELL-
DCM study showed reduction of clinical cardiac events in a
randomized controlled study evaluating TESI of two types of
BMCs [22]. Nevertheless, the field of cardiac stem cell therapy
continues to engender controversy, particularly via the concern of
potential arrhythmogenic effects [23]. Early preclinical work dem-
onstrated both pro- and anti-arrhythmic effects [15–17, 24, 25].

 well as the different routes of administration (intracoronary, intra-
ventricular), may account for varied results.
In early human clinical studies with injection of stem cells into
the heart, there was concern for ventricular arrhythmia. Menashe
et al. showed that four of nine surviving patients with skeletal
myoblast implants at the time of bypass surgery developed VT
[26]. Another study also revealed potential ventricular proarrhyth-
mic effects from skeletal myoblast transplantation at the time of
bypass surgery [27]. These early studies set a precedent that stem
cell implants may be proarrhythmic. Furthermore, there were
plausible mechanisms to explain proarrhythmia. Stem cell implants
could set up areas of heterogeneous conduction and repolariza-
tion, which could serve as a substrate for ventricular dysrhythmias.
Recent human clinical studies using either BMCs or MSCs
have shown neither pro- nor antiarrhythmic effects from stem cell
implantation. In fact, there have been no clinical studies of stem
cells implanted in the heart designed to prospectively test antiar-
rhythmic effects. In one study, autologous mononuclear bone
marrow cells did not demonstrate any ventricular proarrhythmia,
although indices of parasympathetic tone were suppressed [28].
In the BOOST randomized clinical study, there was no difference in
ambulatory monitor ventricular ectopy burden, nonsustained VT,
or inducible VT in patients treated after acute MI with autologous
BMCs as compared with control patients [29]. Beeres et al. dem-
onstrated that intramyocardial BMC injection does not induce
ventricular arrhythmias nor does it alter electrophysiological prop-
erties [18]. Furthermore, Huikuri et al. established neutral arrhyth-
mogenic effects from intracoronary injection of BMCs in patients
treated post STEMI [19]. Conversely, Hare et al. noted a reduction
in monitored NSVT episodes in an early study of intravenous allo-
geneic hMSCs [30]. Finally, the recently published MSC-HF trial
showed similar rates of VT/VF (5%) in MSC injected patients and
placebo injected patients [31]. Though BMCs have been shown to
be safe for patients with chronic ICM in the TAC-HFT trial, they
were not shown to be more efficacious than placebo in terms of
decreasing infarct size and improving regional myocardial func-
tion. For this reason, we decided to focus on MSCs for this post
hoc analysis despite certain advantages only afforded with BMCs.
By combining the data sets from the POSEIDON and TAC-HFT
studies, we studied potential arrhythmogenic effects of autolo-
gous and allogeneic MSCs in one of the largest groups of patients
to date. No proarrhythmic effects from MSC implant occurred
either in the short-term (within days) as a result of the injury or
long-term (up to 1 year). Furthermore, there was no evidence
that MSC implant increased ventricular arrhythmias or worsened
markers of ventricular arrhythmias. Although the changes
observed in our post hoc analysis for ventricular ectopy in the
MSC group were not statistically significant, there was a consistent
trend toward improvement. This may relate to the small sample
size and the overall low burden of ventricular arrhythmias. Further
studies are needed to better address this question.
Moreover, MSC implantation was associated with scar size
reduction [6]. In addition, scar size has been correlated with ven-
tricular arrhythmias in ICM [30]. In our study, we identified a sig-
nificant but weak correlation in the patients who received MSCs
between percentage change in scar size from baseline to 12
months and percentage change in ventricular ectopy over the
same time period.This correlation was not present for the BMC or
Placebo groups. As scar and peri-infarct ischemic tissue plays a
large role in VT in patients with ICM, any potential antiarrhythmic
effects from MSC may be mitigated in part by scar reduction.
Other possible mechanisms for reduction in ventricular arrhyth-
mia may be due to reduction in areas of heterogeneous conduc-
tion through direct injection of stem cells in peri-infarct areas, or
conversely, improved cell-cell coupling and positive remodeling
may lead to enhanced myocardial function. In addition, the secre-
tion of paracrine factors from MSCs should not be overlooked as a
potential mechanism. These protective paracrine effects have
been shown to have important roles in cardiac repair and regener-
ation which can in turn influence cardiac remodeling. In these tri-
als, relevant paracrine growth factors were not measured, but this
may be important to consider in future studies.
The limitations of this study are important to consider, as this
was a post hoc analysis of two separate, randomized clinical trials.
Therefore, the patient populations and therapies differed. Patients
in both trials were medically optimized with evidence-based thera-
pies (statins, aspirin, beta blockers, and ACE inhibitors/ARBs),
counseled regularly about lifestyle choices, and followed closely
during the 1-year period, and these therapies alone could have
contributed to clinical improvement. Also, both trials were Phase
I/II studies to examine the safety and efficacy of different types
(allogeneic/autologous) and doses of MSC, and only one study had
a placebo control and a BMC group. Furthermore, the patients in
these studies had relatively low VE burden and no recent VT epi-
sodes. Therefore, it would be difficult to prove an antiarrhythmic
effect from MSC implant in a group that was not having significant
or sufficient ventricular ectopy or tachyarrhythmias.
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, transendocardial injection of MSCs to the border
zone of infarcted myocardium in patients with ICM was not associ-
ated with short-term (days) or long-term (one year) ventricular
proarrhythmia. In a group of patients selected with low ventricu-
lar ectopy burden, there were signals of improvement in either
ventricular arrhythmias or markers of ventricular arrhythmias.
Prospective studies may clarify the role of TESI with MSCs to
reduce ventricular arrhythmias.
