 Young Adult Smokers' Neural Response to Graphic Cigarette Warning
Labels
Abstract
Introduction: The study examined young adult smokers' neural response to graphic warning labels (GWLs)
on cigarette packs using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
Methods: Nineteen young adult smokers (M age 22.9, 52.6% male, 68.4% non-white, M 4.3 cigarettes/day)
completed pre-scan, self-report measures of demographics, cigarette smoking behavior, and nicotine
dependence, and an fMRI scanning session. During the scanning session participants viewed cigarette pack
images (total 64 stimuli, viewed 4 s each) that varied based on the warning label (graphic or visually occluded
control) and pack branding (branded or plain packaging) in an event-related experimental design.
Participants reported motivation to quit (MTQ) in response to each image using a push-button control.
Whole-brain blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional images were acquired during the task.
Results: GWLs produced significantly greater self-reported MTQ than control warnings (p < .001). Imaging
data indicate stronger neural activation in response to GWLs than the control warnings at a cluster-corrected
threshold p < .001 in medial prefrontal cortex, amygdala, medial temporal lobe, and occipital cortex. There
were no significant differences in response to warnings on branded versus plain cigarette packages.
Conclusions: In this sample of young adult smokers, GWLs promoted neural activation in brain regions
involved in cognitive and affective decision-making and memory formation and the effects of GWLs did not
differ on branded or plain cigarette packaging. These findings complement other recent neuroimaging GWL
studies conducted with older adult smokers and with adolescents by demonstrating similar patterns of neural
activation in response to GWLs among young adult smokers.

1. Introduction
Graphic warning labels (GWLs) for cigarette packs have been imple-
mented in more than 65 countries (Sanders-Jackson, Song, Hiilamo, &
Glantz, 2013) based on evidence that they are more effective than
text-only warnings for reducing smoking (Noar et al., 2015). Research
can continue to inform GWL implementation in at least two important
ways. Studies investigating optimal approaches to designing GWL mes-
sages can inform changes to GWLs to ensure sustained effectiveness. In
contexts such as the U.S. where law requires GWLs (U.S. Congress,
2009) but lawsuits have delayed their implementation, research ad-
dressing concerns raised by the courts can support implementation
(Kraemer & Baig, 2013).
Studies investigating GWLs have relied largely on self-report methods,
demonstrating that GWLs generate stronger cognitive and emotional
responses, are better recalled, and produce stronger motivation to quit
smoking than text-only warnings (Azagba & Sharaf, 2013; Borland,
Wilson, Fong, et al., 2009; Emery, Romer, Sheerin, Jamieson, & Peters,
2014;

Nonnemaker, Choiniere, Farrelly, Kamyab, & Davis, 2015; Peters, Romer,
Slovic, et al., 2007). However, self-report measures of such constructs do
not fully predict future behavior, and biobehavioral methods may help bet-
ter understand GWL impact (Armitage, Norman, Alganem, & Conner,
2015; Falk, Berkman, Whalen, & Lieberman, 2011; Webb & Sheeran, 2006).
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can ascertain infor-
mation on smokers' responses to GWLs that is not readily captured by
self-report (Falk, 2010). fMRI-measured neural activity in brain regions

 involved in emotional (i.e., amygdala) and cognitive (i.e., medial pre-
frontal cortex) processing of antismoking messages predicts cessation
outcomes, explaining ≥20% additional variance in cessation behavior
than self-report responses to messages (Chua, Ho, Jasinska, et al.,
2011; Falk, Berkman, Mann, Harrison, & Lieberman, 2010; Falk et al.,
2011; Jasinska et al., 2012; Wang, Ruparel, Loughead, et al., 2013).
Two studies also showed that GWLs produce activation in brain regions
involved with emotion, cognition, and memory formation among cur-
rent smokers (Newman-Norlund, Thrasher, Fridriksson, et al., 2014;
Wang, Lowen, Romer, Giorno, & Langleben, 2015). Other research
links frontoinsular neural activity to craving reduction in response to
GWLs (Do & Galvan, 2015) and demonstrates that neural responses in
similar brain systems implicated in motivation, cognition, and memory
are associated with population-level success of GWL-type messages for
promoting cessation (Falk, O'Donnell, Tompson, et al., 2016).
This study extends this research by investigating young adult smokers'
neural responses to GWLs and assessing whether effects differ by branded
or plain cigarette packaging. Studies of neural responses to GWLs have
been conducted with older adult smokers (Newman-Norlund et al.,
2014; Wang et al., 2015) and adolescents (Do & Galvan, 2015). Howev-
er, young adults are a priority for tobacco control due to high rates of
smoking experimentation, frequent transitions to regular smoking,
and the high prevalence of smoking in this group (Do & Galvan, 2015;
Falk et al., 2016). Plain packaging is hypothesized to draw greater atten-
tion to and increase the effects of GWLs by eliminating tobacco industry
branding, but this has not yet been tested using a neuroimaging para-
digm. Examining young adult smokers' neural response to GWLs on
branded and plain packaging can extend the evidence surrounding po-
tential mechanisms of GWL action and inform future research and
policy.
2. Methods
2.1. Participants and procedures
Participants were recruited through online and community-based
advertisements and screened for eligibility. Eligible participants were
ages 18 to 30 years, current smokers defined using validated epidemio-
logic measures and criteria as smoking ≥100 lifetime cigarettes and now
smoking cigarettes all or some days (Agaku, King, Husten, et al., 2014).
Participants also reported Camel, Marlboro, or Newport as their
preferred cigarette brand. The latter criterion was imposed to tailor ex-
perimental stimuli to smokers' preferred brand, described below. All
participants also met fMRI safety requirements (Kanal, Borgstede,
Barkovich, et al., 2002). Eligible participants were scheduled for an
in-person appointment to provide informed consent and complete a
pre-scan, self-report assessment and fMRI scanning session. Prior to
the appointment, participants were instructed to smoke as they normal-
ly would that day. All participants provided written informed consent,
and all procedures were approved by an institutional review board.
2.2. Pre-scan measures
Pre-scan measures included demographics, cigarette smoking
behaviors (Agaku et al., 2014), nicotine dependence (Heatherton,
Kozlowski, Frecker, & Fagerstrom, 1991), and motivation to quit
smoking (Mays, Niaura, et al., 2015; Mays, Turner, et al., 2015).
2.3. Experimental design
The study employed a two (graphic warning or control) by two
(branded or plain cigarette pack) within-subjects design. Stimuli were
adapted from a prior experiment (Mays, Niaura, et al., 2015; Mays,
Turner, et al., 2015). GWLs tested were four of the warnings proposed
for use in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commu-
nicating the smoking-associated risks of lung disease, cancer, stroke/
heart attack, and mortality. These four warnings have been effective at
eliciting cognitive and emotional responses in prior studies with
young adults (Cameron, Pepper, & Brewer, 2015; Hammond, Reid,
Driezen, & Boudreau, 2013). Similar to another recent study (Wang
et al., 2015), control warnings included the same warning text as
GWLs but were composed of geometric shapes overlayed on the
GWLs to produce a similar appearance while visually occluding graphic
content.
GWLs and control warnings were displayed on cigarette pack images
sized to the dimensions of a standard cigarette pack. The pack brand
(Camel, Marlboro, or Newport) was tailored to smokers' preferred
brand to account for brand preferences within the design (Bansal-
Travers, Hammond, Smith, & Cummings, 2011). Branded packs were
created using pack images available from an online database at the
time of the study (Tobacco Labelling Resource Centre, n.d.). Plain
packs displayed the brand name in standard font and were brown in
color and stripped of all branding (Mays, Niaura, et al., 2015; Mays,
Turner, et al., 2015). Stimuli were presented in randomized order such
that the same warning did not appear consecutively and there were
no more than two consecutive repeats from the same condition. Exam-
ple GWL and control warnings are shown in Fig. 1; complete stimuli in-
cluding pack images are available from the corresponding author.
Participants viewed each pack image in the scanner for 4 s. During
the scan participants used a push-button control to report how much
each image motivated them to quit smoking, with response options
from (1) Not At All to (4) A Lot (Mays, Niaura, et al., 2015; Mays,
Turner, et al., 2015).
2.4. Imaging data acquisition
Functional data were acquired in an event-related paradigm per-
formed using a 3-T Allegra System (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) to col-
lect whole-brain T2*-weighted blood oxygenation level dependent
(BOLD) functional images (asymmetric spin-echo echo-planar se-
quence; whole-brain repetition time, TR = 2000 ms; echo time =
25 ms; field of view = 256 mm; flip angle = 80°; matrix = 64 × 64;
axial slices 4 mm thick). Sequential whole-brain volumes (32 contigu-
ous slices) were collected during one event-related functional run.
Sixty-four task trials were presented in total, lasting 4 s each with “jit-
ter” interleaved between trials across a range from 250 to 4250 ms.
The scanning run began with an unanalyzed fixation period equal to 3
TRs, which allowed the scanner to reach steady state.
2.5. Statistical analyses
fMRI data processing was carried out using FEAT (fMRI Expert Anal-
ysis Tool) Version 5.98, part of FSL (FMRIB's Software Library) (FSL,
n.d.). General Linear Model-based analysis in FEAT uses FSL tools includ-
ing Brain Extraction Tool (BET) (Smith, 2002), an affine registration tool,
FMRIB's Linear Image Registration Tool (FLIRT) (Jenkinson, Bannister,
Brady, & Smith, 2002; Jenkinson & Smith, 2001), and a motion-
correction tool based on FLIRT (MCFLIRT) (Jenkinson et al., 2002).
FEAT carries out standard-space registration after time-series statistics.
FSL time-series statistics correct for temporal smoothness by applying
pre-whitening (Woolrich, Ripley, Brady, & Smith, 2001). The following
pre-statistics processing was applied: spatial smoothing using a Gauss-
ian kernel of FWHM 5 mm; grand-mean intensity normalization of the
entire 4D dataset by a single multiplicative factor; highpass temporal fil-
tering (Gaussian-weighted least-squares straight line fitting, with
sigma = 50.0 s). Registration to high resolution structural and, subse-
quently, standard space images was performed using FLIRT. At the indi-
vidual subjects level, a design matrix was fitted to each subject's data as
part of a general linear model with each condition modeled as events
with a specified duration (i.e., the time from stimulus onset to onset of
the response) convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response func-
tion. Higher-level analysis was performed using FMRIB's Local Analysis
29

 of Mixed Effects (Beckmann, Jenkinson, & Smith, 2003). Z (Gaussianized
T/F) statistic images were thresholded using an exploratory cluster-
corrected threshold of p b 0.001.
3. Results
Participants (n = 19) averaged 22.9 years of age (SD 3.3), smoked on
average 4.3 (SD 2.5, range 0–10) cigarettes on a typical day, averaged 3.1
(SD 1.1, range 2–6) on the FTND, and 68.4% reported using at least one
other tobacco product (e.g., electronic cigarettes, hookah) in the past
30 days (Supplementary Table 1). Overall, 52.6% of participants were
male, and 68.4% were non-white race/ethnicity (Supplementary
Table 1). Self-report motivation to quit smoking during the imaging
task was significantly greater for GWLs (M 3.25, SD 0.65) than the con-
trol warnings (M 1.96, SD 0.79, t(18) = 8.15, p b .001).
Results of the whole-brain functional imaging analysis contrasting
neural activity in response to GWLs versus control warnings are
shown in Table 1. Compared to control warnings, there was significantly
greater activation in response to GWLs in the left medial frontal gyrus,
right middle occipital gyrus, right orbital gyrus, left parietal precuneus,
areas of left medial temporal cortex, specifically, left parahippocampal
gyrus (extending to hippocampus), and left amygdala (Table 1). Activa-
tion in two of these regions (medial prefrontal cortex, and amygdala;
see Fig. 1) was of a priori interest based on their respective roles in emo-
tional and cognitive decision-making (Falk et al., 2010, 2011; Jasinska
et al., 2012; Newman-Norlund et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015). Analyses
were thus conducted for these regions using a priori-defined regions of
interest (ROIs) using anatomical probabilistic atlas-derived masks and
images from the Harvard-Oxford cortical atlas within the FSL suite. An
additional post-hoc, exploratory analysis was conducted using the
same ROI approach for medial temporal activity using an atlas-defined
hippocampus + parahippocampus region. Activation averaged across
voxels was extracted for each ROI for the Warning Labels N Control
contrast. Prior research also suggests that activity in these brain regions
is associated with tobacco-related decision-making, including cessation
behavior (Falk et al., 2010, 2011; Jasinska et al., 2012; Newman-Norlund
et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015). To test this possibility, we conducted ex-
ploratory analyses examining whether activity in these three ROIs was
correlated with in-scanner, self-reported motivation to quit in response
to the pack images during the task. A multiple regression model using
extracted activation for these three ROIs as regressors indicated that dif-
ferences in amygdala activity in response to GWLs versus control warn-
ings was significantly associated with in scanner-ratings of how much
the warnings motivated them to quit smoking (β = .72, t(15) = 3.00,
p = .009). The medial prefrontal and medial temporal ROI regressors
did not reach significance in this model.
There were no significant differences in neural activation between
branded or plain packs, and the interaction between warning label
(graphic or control) and pack branding (plain or branded) was not sig-
nificant. In sensitivity analyses using imaging data from branded packs
only (data not shown), findings reported for GWLs versus control warn-
ings were consistent.
4. Discussion
Among young adult smokers GWLs produced greater activation in
brain regions involved in cognitive and emotional decision-making
and memory formation compared with visually occluded control warn-
ings. These findings are consistent with other investigations, converging
on potential neurobiological mechanisms that may underlie behavioral
response to graphic content in GWLs.
That GWLs produced greater amygdala activation is consistent with
research with adult smokers indicating highly emotionally salient
GWLs, similar to those tested, elicit the strongest amygdala response
(Newman-Norlund et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015). Similar responses
to GWLs have been associated with craving reduction post-exposure
(Do & Galvan, 2015), and greater amygdala activation to anti-smoking
messages has predicted cessation (Jasinska et al., 2012). Our correla-
tional analysis of ROI activity with in-scanner, self-reported motivation

 to quit in response to GWLs provides additional support for this idea,
indicating that greater amygdala activity in response to GWLs is corre-
lated with stronger self-reported motivation to quit smoking. The
consistency of these observations with general studies of emotional re-
sponse to high-arousal images (Lindquist, Wager, Kober, Bliss-Moreau,
& Barrett, 2012) also suggests that emotional content of GWLs is not
being eliminated by young smokers, who may be motivated to disre-
gard anti-smoking messages through counter-arguing or other defen-
sive mechanisms.
That GWLs activated medial temporal regions including the hippo-
campus is congruent with evidence indicating that emotionally salient
GWLs generate the strongest hippocampal activation and are better
recalled by adult smokers (Newman-Norlund et al., 2014; Wang et al.,
2015). The hippocampus plays a critical role in memory formation,
and the amygdala is within a network of brain regions thought to medi-
ate encoding of emotional stimuli (Wang et al., 2015). This suggests a
cognitive-affective neurobiological pathway through which GWL mes-
sages are encoded, extending self-report evidence on GWL effects
(Noar et al., 2015).
We also found greater activation in response to GWLs in areas of the
medial prefrontal cortex that are involved in self-related processing and
positive valuation of external stimuli (Bartra, McGuire, & Kable, 2013;
Denny, Kober, Wager, & Ochsner, 2012). In prior studies, medial pre-
frontal activation in response to smoking cessation messages is a stron-
ger predictor of future cessation behavior than self-report responses to
such messages (Chua et al., 2011; Falk et al., 2011). Similarly, research
also indicates that medial prefrontal activation in response to GWL-
type images on public health messages is a stronger predictor of
population-level effects of these messages for promoting cessation
(Falk et al., 2016) than self-report responses. Although activity in the
medial prefrontal and medial temporal ROIs was not significantly corre-
lated with in-scanner, self-reported motivation to quit, this may not
necessarily be a strong indication that activity in these regions in re-
sponse to GWLs is not associated with future behavior change. In previ-
ous studies neural activity in response to similar cessation messages,
particularly in the medial prefrontal region, is a stronger predictor of
future quitting behavior than self-report measures (Falk et al., 2010,
2011). Overall, our findings are consistent with the idea that GWLs
may motivate cessation among young smokers by integrating affective
salience and self-related processing.
We did not observe differences in neural activation to GWLs based
on branded versus plain cigarette packaging. One hypothesis proposed
previously is that removing branding may reduce the degree to which
packs stimulate anticipated reward among smokers, decreasing
neural activation in brain regions involved in reward anticipation
(e.g., ventral striatum) (Martin, 2014). The lack of differences could be
due to the modest sample size and insufficient statistical power to
detect subtle effects, or the low levels of nicotine dependence in the
sample (i.e., less craving in response to pack images to produce a clear
contrast) (Munafo, Roberts, Bauld, & Leonards, 2011). These issues
should be examined in future studies.
This study has important limitations. The sample included young
adults who smoked on average about 5 cigarettes per day and with rel-
atively low levels of nicotine dependence. The findings observed within
this relatively heterogeneous sample of young smokers may not gener-
alize to older, heavier smoking populations. However, as noted the re-
sults are generally consistent with recent neuroimaging GWL studies
conducted with older, heavier smoking adults and adolescents, suggest-
ing that these studies may converge on similar findings. We did not
gather additional information on the sample that may have affected
our findings, such as psychiatric comorbidities and detailed information
on use of tobacco products other than cigarettes. The contrast of prima-
ry interest in the present study was between GWLs and visually occlud-
ed control warnings. Given our results and the related literature
described herein, it appears likely that the intended featural differences
between GWLs and control warnings (e.g., emotional salience, self-
relevance) rather than incidental features (e.g., color or luminance)
are primarily responsible for the observed regional effects. However,
the possibility that non-identical incidental visual features in control
vs. GWL images had some effect on our data cannot be ruled out. Finally,
we did not investigate other questions germane to policy that will be
important to examine in the future, such as whether varying GWL
message design (e.g., level of graphicness, message content) or size
(e.g., 30% of pack surface versus 50%) impacts observed neural activa-
tion. Future research that directly links such neural activation to down-
stream, smoking-relevant cognitions and behaviors is also important.
Despite these limitations, our findings contribute to an apparent
convergence of evidence on neurobiological mechanisms involving
emotional cognitive decision-making and memory formation in re-
sponse to GWLs among smokers. Our study uniquely adds to this evi-
dence by demonstrating that even in a sample of young adult smokers
that may be motivated to disregard GWL messages, their effects are con-
sistent with broader research on emotionally salient, aversive images
and are evident with plain and branded packaging. These data begin
to delineate a neural underlay for recent self-report investigations indi-
cating that GWLs are an important intervention for motivating young
adult smokers to quit (Cameron et al., 2015; Magnan & Cameron,
2015; Mays, Turner, et al., 2015; Villanti, Pearson, Cantrell, Vallone, &
Rath, 2015). Future studies can advance this area of research by pro-
spectively examining whether neural activation in response to GWLs
predicts future quitting behavior and examining differences based on
aspects of warning message content relevant to policy decision-
making (Newman-Norlund et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015).
