Abstract
Introduction—Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) are popular among cigarette 
smokers; however, it is not known whether the use of ENDS assists or delays quitting cigarettes, 
especially among certain priority populations. We examined predictors of intention to quit 
smoking and patterns of dual use of ENDS and traditional cigarettes among priority populations.
Methods—This study used data from a 2014 survey of a national probability sample of 5,717 
USA adults. Descriptive statistics were used to examine differences in intention to quit cigarette 
use among current cigarette smokers (n=1,014) and dual users of cigarettes and ENDS (n=248). 
Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted on the overall sample and the subsample

 of dual users to determine whether dual use (versus cigarette only use) and demographic 
characteristics predict self-reported intention to quit and having attempted to quit in the past year. 
Significance was set at p<0.05.
Results—Compared to cigarette smokers, dual users were slightly more educated (p<0.05), more 
likely to intend to quit smoking (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=1.8, p=0.001), and more likely to have 
attempted to quit smoking in the past year (AOR=1.7, p=0.003). Blacks reported higher intention 
to quit than Whites (AOR=1.8, p= 0.003). Compared with high school education or less, dual users 
with some college (AOR = 1.5, p = 0.007) or a college degree (AOR = 2.5, p ≤ 0.0001) had high 
intention to quit.
Conclusions—Dual users of ENDS and traditional cigarettes are more likely to intend to quit 
smoking and have recently made quit attempts. If using ENDS contributes to increased smoking 
cessation among more educated individuals, disparity in smoking by level of education will 
increase.

Introduction
A recent commentary argues that technological innovation such as electronic nicotine 
delivery systems (ENDS) may widen the existing smoking disparity among 
socioeconomically disadvantaged groups if measures that improve access to harm-reduction 
tools are not made available (Kalousova, 2015a, 2015b). Disparities in tobacco use persist, 
with higher smoking rates and slower declines in prevalence over the last decade among less 
educated and low income groups (Agaku, et al., 2014; Caraballo, et al., 1998; Garrett, Dube, 
Trosclair, Caraballo, & Pechacek, 2011; Jamal, et al., 2014; Jamal, et al., 2015; U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, & National Cancer 
Institute, 2014). Women experience greater difficulty quitting compared to men when treated 
with the nicotine patch; however, no sex differences have been observed for intention to quit 
(Fagan, et al., 2007; Perkins & Scott, 2008). The rates of ENDS use have increased from 
4.9% in 2011 to 15.9% in 2014 among adults who smoke cigarettes (King, Alam, Promoff, 
Arrazola, & Dube, 2013; McMillen, Gottlieb, Shaefer, Winickoff, & Klein, 2014; 
Schoenborn CA, 2015). Studies suggest that ENDS use is associated with the perceptions 
that ENDS are less harmful than cigarettes and that they are effective smoking cessation 
tools (Brose, Hitchman, Brown, West, & McNeill, 2015; Pepper & Brewer, 2014; Pepper, 
Emery, Ribisl, Rini, & Brewer, 2015; Pepper, Ribisl, Emery, & Brewer, 2014; Siegel, 
Tanwar, & Wood, 2011; Tan & Bigman, 2014; Vickerman, Carpenter, Altman, Nash, & 
Zbikowski, 2013).
However, there are little data on which subpopulations of US adults are using ENDS to quit 
smoking. The objective of this study is to examine dual use status and sociodemographic 
predictors that are associated with smokers’ intentions to quit and making quit attempts. For 
this cross-sectional study, we use intention to quit and making quit attempts as proxy for 
quitting smoking. To assess the perceived potential benefits of electronic cigarettes among

 current smokers, we examined the opinions of dual users regarding the health effects of 
ENDS.
Methods
Study Sample
This study used data from the 2014 Tobacco Products and Risk Perceptions Survey (TPRPS) 
conducted by the Georgia State University (GSU) Tobacco Center of Regulatory Science. 
The TPRPS is an annual, cross-sectional survey of a probability sample drawn from GfK’s 
KnowledgePanel and is weighted to be representative of non-institutionalized US adults. The 
methodology for this study has been described elsewhere (Weaver, et al., 2016). This study 
was approved by the GSU Institutional Review Board.
Measures
The respondents’ characteristics were obtained from profile surveys administered by GfK to 
all KnowledgePanel panelists and included self-reported data on sex, age, race/ethnicity, 
educational attainment, annual household income, and health status. Data on tobacco use, 
intention to quit, and attempts to stop smoking were collected through a self-report, online 
questionnaire.
Current smokers were respondents who reported lifetime smoking levels of at least 100 
cigarettes and smoking “everyday” or “some days.” Dual users were respondents who 
currently smoked cigarettes and used ENDS within the past 30 days. We excluded current 
users of little cigars or cigarillos, large cigars, and hookahs. Intention to quit was categorized 
as “high intention to quit” or “low intention to quit” using responses from a six-point scale. 
Responses of planning to quit within 7 days to within a year were categorized as “high 
intention to quit,” and responses of not planning or will plan to quit someday were 
categorized as “low intention to quit.” Respondents were asked if they had attempted to quit 
smoking in the past year (“yes” or “no”). The perception of health benefits from using 
ENDS was assessed by asking “How much do you think about each of the following now, 
how using e-cigarettes might improve your health?” Response options were “a lot,” “a 
little,” “not at all,” and “I don’t know.”
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.3, with significance set a priori at p < 
0.05. The SAS survey procedures were used with sample weights to account for the complex 
survey design. Differences in dual use proportions among smokers by demographic 
characteristics were examined using chi-squared tests of association. We conducted 
descriptive statistics to examine differences in intention to quit among cigarette smokers and 
dual users by educational level, and to examine differences in dual users’ perceptions of how 
ENDS use may benefit their health by their intention to quit smoking. Multivariable logistic 
regression models tested whether intention to quit smoking and quit attempts in the past year 
differed for dual users compared to cigarette-only users. Multivariable logistic regression 
models were conducted for the overall sample and among the subset of dual users. We

 further examined sociodemographic factors that were associated with intention to quit and 
quit attempts.
Results
Participant Characteristics
The study included 1262 current smokers, of which 19% (248) were dual users (i.e., 
currently using ENDS plus cigarettes). No significant differences in sociodemographic 
characteristics were observed between cigarette-only users and dual users except for 
education (p=0.027) (Table 1). A higher proportion of dual users were college graduates 
compared to cigarette-only smokers.
The percentage reporting a high intention to quit differed significantly between cigarette 
smokers and dual users and across education levels (data not shown). A higher proportion of 
dual users had high intention to quit compared to cigarette smokers. Having high intention to 
quit was significant among participants with high school education or less (p = 0.04) and 
college graduates (p = 0.02) (Fig. A.1).
Intention to quit
In multivariable analyses, dual users were more likely to have a high intention to quit 
smoking (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=1.79, 95% CI=1.27–2.54). Blacks (non-Hispanic) were 
more likely to report a high intention to quit than Whites (non-Hispanic) (AOR=1.81, 95% 
CI=1.22–2.67). Compared with high school education or less, those with a college degree 
(AOR=2.46, 95% CI=1.61–3.77) and some college/vocational education (AOR=1.5, 95% 
CI=1.12–2.0) had greater odds of high intention to quit. Odds of intention to quit did not 
vary significantly by gender, age, income, or health status (Table 2, model 1). Dual smokers 
with a college degree were significantly more likely to have a high intention to quit smoking 
compared to those with high school education or less (AOR 4.74; 95% CI, 1.71–13.15) 
(Table 2, model 2).
Compared to dual users with a low intention to quit (14%), those with a high intention to 
quit (30%) were significantly more likely to believe that e-cigarette use might improve their 
health (p = 0.024) (Fig. A.2).
Quit attempts
In multivariable analyses, dual users were more likely to have attempted to quit smoking in 
the past year (AOR=1.70; 95% CI=1.21–2.40) than smokers of only cigarettes. Compared to 
Whites, Blacks reported higher odds of having made quit attempts in the past year 
(AOR=1.58; 95% CI, 1.06–2.35) (Table 2, model 1). Among dual users, having a college 
degree was associated with higher odds of having attempted to quit smoking in the past year 
(AOR= 2.75; 95% CI, 1.16–6.49) (Table 2, model 2).
Discussion
Findings from this study suggest that dual users and those with high educational attainment 
were more likely to have higher intention to quit and attempts to quit smoking. Among dual

 users, having a college degree was associated with high intention to quit smoking and 
attempting to quit in the past year. This study highlights patterns in ENDS use that may 
increase the socioeconomic gap in smoking prevalence as marked by educational differences 
in the intention to quit and making quit attempts.
Previous research has associated long-term smoking cessation with motivation to quit, 
having attempted to quit, and using evidence-based smoking cessation aids (U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services, et al., 2014). These findings are similar to those 
from another study in which ENDS use was associated with high intention to quit smoking 
(Rutten, et al., 2015). The authors found a high level of ENDS use among college graduates 
as well as proportionally less use among Blacks and other minorities compared to Whites. 
Consistent with that study (Rutten, et al., 2015), we found that current smokers used ENDS 
with an intention to quit smoking cigarettes or reduce the use of combustible cigarettes. If 
ENDS use proves to be helpful for smoking cessation among long-term smokers, then 
interventions to improve access to ENDS among minority smokers and those with low levels 
of education may be needed to reduce smoking-related disparities (Kalousova, 2015a, 
2015b). In addition, this finding underscores the need for ongoing surveillance to monitor 
the long-term implication and effectiveness of ENDS as a cessation tool among dual users 
who desire to quit smoking conventional cigarettes.
Limitations
These data are cross-sectional and self-reported, which makes it difficult to assess the actual 
rates of smoking cessation among ENDS users or how much dual use may be delaying 
smoking cessation or leading to actual quitting in the future. Self-reported data have 
potential recall and reporting biases. The study used an online panel, some of whom had 
participated in prior tobacco research; however, GfK data suggest minimal panel 
conditioning from participation in prior tobacco research, which helps mitigate this concern.
Conclusions
This study provides estimates of dual use patterns and the intention to quit smoking 
cigarettes among the US adult population. It suggests that dual users have high intention to 
quit smoking, but a smoking disparity related to cessation may still exist among adults with 
less education. Determining pathways underlying these disparities associated with education 
level and developing strategies to eliminate them may help reduce health inequalities among 
smokers. Future research should focus on determining whether high intention to quit 
smoking is associated with future cessation among dual users of ENDS.
