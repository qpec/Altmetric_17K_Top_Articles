STUDY QUESTION: Is adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) associated with better IVF performance in women attempting fertility?
SUMMARY ANSWER: Greater adherence to the MedDiet, defined using the validated Mediterranean diet score (MedDietScore), was
associated with a higher likelihood of achieving clinical pregnancy and live birth among non-obese women <35 years of age.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Diet impacts fertility and certain nutrients and food groups appear to have a greater effect on reproduct-
ive health, but there are relatively few published data on the role of dietary patterns, and the MedDiet in particular, on assisted reproductive
performance.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This prospective cohort study included 244 non-obese women (22–41 years of age; BMI < 30 kg/
m2) who underwent a first IVF treatment in an Assisted Conception Unit in Athens, Greece, between November 2013 and September 2016.
The study was designed to evaluate the influence of habitual dietary intake and lifestyle on fertility outcomes.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Diet was assessed before the IVF treatment via a validated food-frequency ques-
tionnaire. Adherence to the MedDiet was assessed through the MedDietScore (range: 0–55), with higher scores indicating greater adherence.
Intermediate outcomes (oocyte yield, fertilization rate and embryo quality measures) and clinical endpoints (implantation, clinical pregnancy and live
birth) were abstracted from electronic medical records. Associations between MedDietScore and IVF outcomes were analysed using generalized lin-
ear models adjusting for age, ovarian stimulation protocol, BMI, physical activity, anxiety levels, infertility diagnosis, caloric intake and supplements use.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: No association of MedDietScore with any of the intermediate outcomes or with
implantation was found. However, compared with women in the highest tertile of the MedDietScore (≥36, n = 86), women in the lowest ter-
tile (≤30, n = 79) had significantly lower rates of clinical pregnancy (29.1 vs 50.0%, P = 0.01) and live birth (26.6 vs 48.8%, P = 0.01). The
multivariable-adjusted relative risk (95% CI) for clinical pregnancy comparing women in the lowest with women in the highest tertile of the
MedDietScore was 0.35 (0.16–0.78; P-trend=0.01), and for live birth it was 0.32 (0.14–0.71; P-trend = 0.01). These associations were signifi-
cantly modified by women’s age (P-interaction <0.01 for both outcomes). MedDietScore was positively related to clinical pregnancy and live
birth among women <35 years old (P ≤ 0.01) but not among women ≥35 years. Among women <35 years, a beneficial 5-point increase in
the MedDietScore was associated with ~2.7 times higher likelihood of achieving clinical pregnancy and live birth.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Our finding cannot be generalized to the whole reproductive population nor to obese women
nor to women attending infertility clinics around the world. In addition, due to the observational study design, causal inference is limited.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The results suggest that diet modifications and greater compliance to the Mediterranean
diet may help increase the chances of a successful pregnancy and delivering a live baby for women undergoing IVF treatment.

 Key words: Mediterranean diet / female fertility / reproduction / IVF / live birth rate
Introduction
Lifestyle factors including diet, smoking, exercise and stress affect
reproductive performance, also during assisted reproduction (Klonoff-
Cohen, 2005; Hornstein, 2016). Several recent reports have suggested
that preconception dietary habits may influence IVF outcome, such as
oocyte and embryo quality, implantation and successful completion of
pregnancy (Braga et al., 2015; Firns et al., 2015; Hornstein, 2016;
Garruti et al., 2017; Machtinger et al., 2017).
Most of the work on this topic has focused on the role of isolated
nutrients (Hammiche et al., 2011) or food groups like dairy (Afeiche
et al., 2016) and whole grains (Gaskins et al., 2016). There are also some
epidemiological studies considering nutrition in the light of a more holistic
approach that focuses on the role of dietary patterns rather than individ-
ual nutrients, foods or groups (Vujkovic et al., 2010; Toledo et al., 2011;
Twigt et al., 2012; Parisi et al., 2017), as this approach probably better
reflects long-term eating habits and behaviours. Among dietary patterns,
the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), a diet rich in vegetables, fruits, whole
grains, legumes, nuts and olive oil, and low in red meat, seems to be the
most promising and widely accepted for its positive effects on human
health (García-Fernández et al., 2014). Previously, Vujkovic et al. (2010)
have investigated the association between preconception dietary pat-
terns and IVF outcomes among subfertile couples in the Netherlands,
and showed that high adherence by the couple to a ‘Mediterranean’ type
pattern (defined using principal component analysis) increased the prob-
ability of pregnancy. A comparable effect for the adherence to a healthy
diet and the chance of ongoing pregnancy following IVF was subsequently
found in a Dutch cohort of couples receiving their first IVF treatment, by
calculating a preconception dietary risk score based on dietary recom-
mendations of the Netherlands Nutrition Centre (Twigt et al., 2012).
However, more studies are needed to confirm the favourable role of a
MedDiet on assisted reproductive performance in other populations.
Moreover, given obesity’s high impact on female reproductive potential
(Maheshwari et al., 2007; Broughton and Moley, 2017; Luke, 2017) it is
essential to clarify the role and the potential mechanism(s) by which diet
quality, and the MedDiet in particular, may exert beneficial effects on
assisted reproduction outcome beyond body weight.
Therefore, the aim of the present study was to explore potential
associations between MedDiet and IVF clinical outcomes among non-
obese women of infertile couples attempting fertility. We hypothesized
that greater adherence to the MedDiet, defined using an a-priori dietary
pattern approach and calculation of the validated Mediterranean diet
score (MedDietScore) (Panagiotakos et al., 2007), would favourably influ-
ence assisted reproductive performance of otherwise healthy women
with no obesity problems.
Materials and Methods
Study population
Couples with primary infertility, seeking evaluation and treatment in an
Assisted Conception Unit in Athens, Greece, were invited to participate
in an ongoing prospective cohort study focusing on investigating how
background diet and lifestyle patterns impact fertility. Female partners
aged ≤41 years, having a BMI of <30 kg/m2, using their own oocytes,
without a previous IVF attempt or pregnancy, and not on a natural cycle
attempt, were eligible for the study. Women had also to not have endo-
metriosis, previous ovarian surgery, a history of diabetes mellitus, cardio-
vascular disease, hypertension, a neoplasm, hypothyroidism or psychiatric
disorders, and not to have changed their dietary habits for at least the
past 6 months. A total of 244 eligible Greek couples were evaluated from
November 2013 until September 2016, and complete data on lifestyle
and IVF parameters were obtained. At enrollment, anthropometric mea-
surements were taken for all study participants and a detailed question-
naire was used to collect data on demographics, reproductive health,
medical history and lifestyle.
All procedures were in accord with the Helsinki Declaration and all
participants provided written informed consent. The study protocol
was approved by the Ethical Review Board of Harokopio University,
Athens, Greece.
Dietary-lifestyle assessment and evaluation
of adherence to the Mediterranean diet
To estimate habitual food and alcohol intake all participants filled out a
semi-quantitative 76-item food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) valid-
ated for the Greek population (Bountziouka et al., 2012).
The FFQ included information on all main food groups and beverages
usually consumed (i.e. 69 questions regarding consumption of cereals,
fruits, vegetables, meat, fish, legumes, dairy products, added fats, alco-
holic beverages, stimulants, sweets), as well as seven questions regarding
eating behaviours (i.e. eating in restaurants or canteens, consumption of
breakfast, number of meals consumed on a daily basis and consumption
of organic products or dietary supplements). The amounts of food con-
sumed were expressed either in grams or millilitres or in other common
measures, such as slice, tablespoon or cup, representing the standard
serving size. Participants were asked to report how often, on average,
during the 6-month period before IVF they had consumed each of the
foods and beverages included in the FFQ according to a 6-grade scale
(never/rarely, 1–3 times/month, 1–2 times/week, 3–6 times/week, 1
times/day or ≥2 times/day). Participants were also asked to report any
use of dietary supplements as well as the frequency of their use (daily,
weekly, monthly or few times/year). The FFQ used has been previously
found to be reproducible and relatively valid for assessing almost all food
groups (i.e. dairy products, fruit, vegetables, starchy products, legumes,
meat, fish, eggs, sweets, alcohol, and fats and oils), as well as the macro-
nutrients and energy intake. Subgroup analysis has also revealed that the
FFQ has good validity regarding food consumption patterns of adults of
both sexes during the year preceding its application and that it has a
similar validity both in normal weight and overweight/obese subjects
(Bountziouka et al., 2012). The FFQ was provided at enrollment and
returned by the day of oocyte retrieval.
Τo evaluate the level of adherence to the MedDiet, the MedDietScore
was calculated for each participant (Panagiotakos et al., 2007) by taking

 into account the consumption of food items from nine food groups, as
well as olive oil and alcoholic beverages. The components and the scoring
system for calculating the MedDietScore are presented in Supplementary
Table SI. The range of the MedDietScore is 0–55, with higher values indic-
ating greater adherence to the MedDiet.
Assessment of physical activity was performed through a validated
Greek version of the ‘International Physical Activity Questionnaire’
(iPAQ), suitable for assessing population levels of self-reported phys-
ical activity, while anxiety was assessed by using the Spielberger State-
Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y), as previously described (Karayiannis
et al., 2017).
IVF procedure and outcome assessment
Before IVF, women underwent ovarian reserve testing and were assigned
into one of three ovarian stimulation protocols as clinically indicated: (i)
GnRH antagonist protocol (Cetrotide, Orgalutran); (ii) follicular-phase
GnRH agonist/Flare protocol (Daronda, Arvekap); or (iii) mild ovarian
stimulation with clomiphene citrate. Subcutaneous recombinant FSH
(Gonal-F, Puregon, Altrmon) and/or hMG (Menopur, Merional, Pergonal)
were administered in all three regimens with a maximum combined daily
dose of 450 IU. Women were monitored during ovarian stimulation for
serum estradiol (E2) and follicle size measurements and counts. hCG was
administered ~36 h before the scheduled oocyte retrieval procedure to
induce ovulation. Oocyte retrieval was performed when follicle sizes
reached 16–18 mm and the E2 level reached at least 1800 pmol/l.
ICSI was carried out for all IVF cycles in this study. Embryologists
classified oocytes as germinal vesicle or metaphase-I or metaphase-II
(by the presence of a polar body) and determined fertilization 17–20 h
after insemination as the number of oocytes with two pronuclei.
Fertilization rate was defined as the total number of fertilized oocytes
divided by the number of metaphase-II oocytes. The resulting embryos
were monitored for cell number and morphological quality (1 = best
to 5 = worst) on Day 3. Embryos that had reached 6–8 cells on Day 3
were considered to be cleaving at a normal rate, whereas embryos
with ≤5 cells and ≥9 were considered to be slow cleaving or to have
accelerated cleavage, respectively. In our analysis, we classified
embryos as high quality if they had at least eight cells on Day 3 and a
morphological quality score of 1 or 2. A maximum of four embryos
was transferred, according to the Greek National Legislation for
embryo transfer guidelines (Greek National Authority of Assisted
Reproduction; Law 3305/01/2005; http://eaiya.gov.gr/en/law-fek/).
We defined successful implantation as a serum β-hCG level >20 IU/
l measured at 14–21 days after oocyte retrieval. Clinical pregnancy
was defined as the presence of an intrauterine pregnancy confirmed by
ultrasound (presence of at least one gestational sac and cardiac activity
at 6 weeks estimated gestational age), and live birth was defined as the
birth of a neonate on or after 24 weeks of gestation. All clinical infor-
mation, including infertility diagnosis, hormone levels and protocol
type, was abstracted from the patient’s electronic medical records.
The primary outcomes were implantation, clinical pregnancy and live
birth, whereas oocyte yield, fertilization rate and embryo quality mea-
sures were used as intermediate outcomes.
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables are presented as median (interquartile range,
IQR), and categorical variables are presented as absolute and relative
frequencies. Associations between categorical variables were tested
by χ2 tests or Fisher’s exact tests (when one or more cell counts were
≤5), while differences between categorical and several clinical and
nutritional variables were tested using the non-parametric Mann–
Whitney-U test. Comparisons between various variables and tertiles
of the MedDietScore were performed using Kruskal–Wallis test, and
the Bonferroni correction was used to account for the increase in
Type-I error. We used generalized linear models to test associations
between the MedDietScore and IVF outcomes. A Poisson distribution
with log link function were used to test association of number of total
and mature oocytes, fertilized oocytes, and high-quality embryos (all
count data), while a binomial distribution with logit link function was
used for fertilization rate and clinical endpoints. The results are pre-
sented as relative risk (RR) and 95% CIs. Tests for trend across tertiles
were conducted by modelling the median value of MedDietScore in
each tertile as a single continuous variable and assessing significance
using Wald test.
Confounding was evaluated using prior knowledge regarding bio-
logical relevance as well as descriptive statistics from our study popula-
tion. Covariates considered in full models included age (years), ovarian
stimulation protocol (antagonist, agonist or clomiphene), BMI (kg/m2),
physical activity (MET-min/week), state/trait-anxiety (score value),
total energy intake (kcal/day), cause of infertility (male factor, female
factor or unexplained infertility) and use of dietary supplements [by
adjusting both for the frequency of use (ordinal) and the type of sup-
plement (as dummy variables)]. We further assessed effect modifica-
tion of MedDietScore with primary outcomes by age (<35 vs ≥35
years), infertility type (male/female/unexplained infertility) and BMI
(<25 vs ≥25 kg/m2) using cross product terms in the final multivari-
able models.
Statistical Package for Social Sciences software (SPSS, version 21.0,
Chicago, IL, USA) was used for all the statistical calculations. All
reported P-values are based on two-sided tests and compared with a
significance level of 5%.
Results
Our study population consisted of 244 women (median age: 35.0
years; range: 22–41 years) who received their first IVF/ICSI treatment
within 2 months after dietary assessment. None of the women were
obese as this was an exclusion criterion from the study (median BMI:
22.8 kg/m2; range: 18.0–29.9 kg/m2). Women were either physically
inactive (38.5%) or minimally active, and the majority had never
smoked (77.5%). Approximately half of the women reported making
use of dietary supplements (45.9%), mainly multivitamins and folate,
but none reported a change in dietary habits over a period of 6-month
preceding evaluation. Overall, 229 women (93.9%) had an embryo
transfer, 138 (56.5%) had a successful implantation, 104 (42.6%)
achieved a clinical pregnancy and 99 (40.5%) had a live birth. Women
with a clinical pregnancy and live birth did not differ in age, BMI, smok-
ing habits, physical activity or stress levels, compared to those who did
not achieve pregnancy (all P > 0.05).
Table I shows the clinical and reproductive characteristics of the
women according to tertiles of the MedDietScore. Compared with
women in the highest tertile of MedDietScore (≥36, n = 86), those in
the lowest tertile (≤30, n = 79) had higher BMI and waist circumfer-
ence, were more frequent physically inactive, and exhibited higher

 levels of current and long-term anxiety. In addition, they had a higher
total energy intake and reported less frequent use of dietary supplements
(all P < 0.01). Unexplained infertility was more common in the group of
women with the highest MedDietScores, but there were no differences
across tertiles of MedDietScore in women’s age distribution, duration of
infertility, ovarian reserve biomarkers (Day 3 FSH/LH levels, anti-
mullerian hormone levels), and in the ovarian stimulation protocol used.
Moreover, oocyte yield, fertilization rates and embryo quality measures
were similar across tertiles of MedDietScore (Table I). Implantation was
also similar across tertiles. However, the rate of clinical pregnancy and
live birth was significantly lower in women in the lowest compared with
women in the highest tertile of MedDietScore (29.1 vs 50.0%, P = 0.01
and 26.6 vs 48.8%, P = 0.01, respectively).
In Table II, the results of the fully adjusted multivariable models for
study’s primary outcomes are presented. Compared with women in
the highest tertile (highest adherence) of the MedDietScore, women in
the lowest tertile (lowest adherence) had at least a 65% lower RR
(95% CI) of achieving clinical pregnancy [0.35 (0.16–0.78), P-trend =
0.01] and live birth [0.32 (0.14–0.71), P-trend = 0.01]. To reduce
potential of confounding by dietary supplementation, we also per-
formed a sensitivity analysis restricted to women not taking supple-
ments (n = 132), using the same covariates as in full models except
supplements use (model 2 in Table II), and found similar results to
those within the full sample. The multivariable-adjusted RR (95% CI)
for clinical pregnancy comparing women in the lowest with women in
the highest tertile of the MedDietScore was 0.29 (0.10–0.82), and for
live birth it was 0.25 (0.09–0.73). No significant association of
MedDietScore with study intermediate outcomes (ovarian stimulation
outcomes, fertilization rate and embryo quality measures) was
observed (data not shown).
We also found a significant MedDietScore × age interaction in the
association with clinical pregnancy (P-interaction = 0.007) and live
birth (P-interaction = 0.008). MedDietScore (continuous) was posi-
tively associated with clinical pregnancy and live birth (P = 0.001)

 among women <35 years old but not among older women. Among
women <35 years, the multivariable-adjusted RR (95% CI) for clinical
pregnancy for increasing MedDietSore was 1.22 (1.05–1.43) and for
women ≥35 years, it was 1.00 (0.92–1.09). The corresponding values
for live birth were 1.25 (1.07–1.45) and 1.01 (0.93–1.11), respectively
(Supplementary Table SII). Additional adjustment for the male part-
ner’s MedDietScore yielded almost identical results (Supplementary
Table SII). Among women <35 years a beneficial 5-point increase in
the MedDietScore associates with ~2.7 times higher likelihood of
achieving clinical pregnancy and live birth. No evidence of effect modi-
fication by infertility type or BMI was observed (P for interaction >0.05
in all cases).
Discussion
In this study among non-obese women undergoing a first autologous
IVF treatment, we assessed adherence to the MedDiet using the valid-
ated MedDietScore and found that greater adherence to this healthy
diet during the 6-month period before IVF was associated with higher
chance of clinical pregnancy and live birth. Specifically, we found that a
beneficial 5-point increase in the MedDietScore was associated with
~2.7 times higher likelihood of clinical pregnancy and live birth among
women <35 years old. The MedDietScore was not related to ovarian
stimulation outcomes, embryo quality measures or implantation.
Surprisingly, the favourable effect of MedDiet was evident among
women <35 years but not among the older women of our study.
Women’s age is the most important risk factor for infertility and data
from a large-scale study have recently confirmed the significant effect
of age also on assisted reproduction outcomes (Grøndahl et al., 2017).
In our cohort, compared with women <35, women ≥35 years had
lower yield of total and mature oocytes [median (IQR): 10 (6–14) vs
13 (8–16), P = 0.003 and 7 (4–10) vs 9 (5–13), P = 0.02, respectively]
and a lower rate of successful implantation (51.4 vs 64.6%, P = 0.04),
but there were no differences in clinical pregnancy and live birth or in
lifestyle factors between the two age-groups. Women experience
major physiological changes in reproductive functions as they age,
including major endocrine alterations (Diamanti-Kandarakis et al.,
2017), and it is possible that such profound changes could mask any
influences from other environmental factors, such as diet quality, that
otherwise impact fertility and IVF success rate also during the later
reproductive years. In line with this, it has been found that a high BMI
has a pronounced negative influence on IVF success at younger ages,
but this effect diminishes as women reach their mid-30s (Sneed et al.,
2008). These authors postulated that in older women, the dominating
effect of age on fertility and IVF outcomes becomes more important
than the effects of BMI.
Our results are consistent with findings of previous studies showing
that high adherence to a healthy diet may improve the chance of preg-
nancy after IVF/ICSI treatment. Vujkovic and collaborators compared
two dietary patterns defined using principal component analysis, a
‘health conscious-less processed’ dietary pattern (consisting of high
intakes of fruits, vegetables, fish and whole grains; and low intakes of
snacks, meats and mayonnaise) and a ‘Mediterranean’ style dietary
pattern (high intakes of vegetable oils, vegetables, fish, and legumes,
and low intakes of snacks). Although the two dietary patterns showed
remarkable overlap in foods, only the ‘Mediterranean’ dietary pattern
was associated with a borderline significant improvement in IVF preg-
nancy rates [odds ratio (OR): 1.4; 95% CI: 1.0–1.9], which may be
attributed to a higher beneficial effect of this dietary pattern on vitamin
B6 and folate levels and to the high intake of vegetable oils (Vujkovic
et al., 2010). In a case–control study nested in a Spanish cohort of uni-
versity graduates, Toledo et al. (2011) used a similar dietary pattern
approach and found that women in the highest quartile of adherence
to a ‘Mediterranean-type’ pattern had a lower risk of difficulty getting
pregnant, compared with women in the lowest quartile (OR: 0.56,
95% CI: 0.35–0.95). More recently, in a study involving 199 Dutch
couples with a first IVF/ICSI treatment, a preconception dietary risk
score (PDR) was assigned giving 1-point to each of six healthy food
groups (fruits, vegetables, meat, fish, whole wheat products and fats)
as determined by the Netherlands Nutrition Centre. There was a high-
er pregnancy rate among women with a higher PDR score (OR: 1.65;
95% CI: 1.08–2.52), suggesting that increasing adherence to Dutch
dietary recommendations in women undergoing IVF treatment
increases the chance of ongoing pregnancy (Twigt et al., 2012).
Central to the effort to link MedDiet with IVF success rate is the
notion that it is a pattern characterized by high consumption of foods
and food groups that have been positively associated with fertility and
treatment outcomes, such as whole grains (Gaskins et al., 2016). In
line with this, the consumption of cereals, vegetables and fruits has
been reported to positively influence embryo quality in women undergo-
ing IVF/ICSI treatment, while increased consumption of red meat
appears to have a negative effect on implantation and clinical pregnancy
rates (Braga et al., 2015). Interestingly, increased fruit and vegetable con-
sumption in male partners has been associated with increased

 fertilization rates (Firns et al., 2015), suggesting a possible relationship
between male diet and some IVF outcome parameters. In our cohort,
MedDietScore was not related to any of the intermediate outcomes, but
a positive association with clinical pregnancy and live birth was observed
even after adjusting for the male partners’ MedDietScore.
The MedDiet has been favourably related to glycemic control (Rossi
et al., 2013), which may be an important parameter affecting preg-
nancy outcome in IVF patients (Wei et al., 2008). In addition, the
MedDiet is characterized by an optimal ratio of macronutrients and a
high intake of beneficial fatty acids, such as mono- and polyunsaturated
fatty acids (from olive oil, fish and nuts). Although it is unclear which
component of the MedDiet mostly contributes to its favourable
effects, a particular feature of this diet is the use of olive oil, which
leads to a high ratio of monounsaturated to saturated fatty acids. Data
from a large prospective cohort study among premenopausal women
without a history of infertility have suggested that replacing unsatur-
ated fats, commonly found in vegetable oils, with trans fatty acids may
increase the risk of ovulatory infertility (Chavarro et al., 2007) and is
likely to also impact on IVF clinical outcome. Interestingly, periconcep-
tional maternal adherence to a ‘high fish and olive oil, low meat’ diet-
ary pattern has recently been positively associated with embryonic
growth in spontaneous pregnancies, although no significant association
was observed in IVF/ICSI pregnancies (Parisi et al., 2017). Similar
effects for the quality of protein and carbohydrate in the diet and the
risk of infertility due to anovulation have been reported (Chavarro
et al., 2008, 2009); hence, apart from lipids, other components of
MedDiet may be equally important.
Since MedDietScore was positively associated with study final out-
come only, we can assume that MedDiet affects key elements in the
endometrial environment which have a positive influence on preg-
nancy maintenance. Using data form the Nurses’ Health Study-II,
Gaskins et al. (2014) have found that prepregnancy adherence to well-
characterized dietary patterns, including the Fertility Diet and the alter-
nate MedDiet pattern, was not associated with risk of pregnancy loss,
although in subanalyses restricted to pregnancies occurring shortly
after diet assessment, the Fertility Diet pattern was inversely related to
pregnancy loss. We also performed a subanalysis restricted to women
with positive β-hCG and found that lower adherence to MedDiet was
associated with lower relative risk of clinical pregnancy and live birth
(Supplementary Table SIII), which suggests that the beneficial effect of
MedDiet could be through increasing embryo survival. Several
mechanisms could explain the observed association, and antioxidants
is a possible candidate. The MedDiet is rich in antioxidants due to the
high consumption of fruit, vegetables and whole grains. Recent data
suggest that oxidative stress and low antioxidant status may lead to
known or unexplained infertility (Agarwal et al., 2012); however, stud-
ies examining the effects of antioxidants administration in fertility treat-
ment have concluded that taking antioxidants in the form of
supplements does not improve fertility outcomes (Showell et al.,
2013). More recently, it has been shown that administration of antioxi-
dants 3 months before IVF cycles improves oocyte quality (Luddi et al.,
2016), while increased intake of antioxidants through diet has been
associated with shorter time for successful conception, although this
effect varied with the women’s BMI and age (Ruder et al., 2014).
Unlike supplements, diet contains antioxidants in ideal proportions
and combinations that dispose, scavenge, or suppress the formation of
reactive oxygen species and contribute against oxidative damage to
the endometrium (Agarwal et al., 2012). The favourable effect of the
MedDiet observed in our study was independent of dietary supple-
mentation, and also confirmed among women not taking supplements.
There are several limitation in our study. First, a single diet assess-
ment was used and FFQ is susceptible to measurement error.
However, due to the study’s prospective character and since one of
the study prerequisites was that the participants should have had
stable eating habits during the last 6 months, any measurement error
would likely be non-differential with respect to the results of IVF treat-
ment. Secondly, study participants were Greek infertile non-obese
women selected from an IVF clinic, so our finding cannot be equally
generalized to the whole reproductive population nor obese women
nor to non-Europeans or women attending infertility clinics around the
world. Thirdly, the possibility of residual confounding by other factors
that were not measured or poorly measured in our study remains,
although we have adjusted for multiple maternal covariates (including
age, BMI, physical activity and stress levels), and additionally for the
male partners’ dietary habits. Alcohol consumption also increases the
risk of IVF failure and a recent review of the literature has concluded
that couples undergoing IVF should be advised to abstain from alcohol
prior to and during their procedures (Nicolau et al., 2014). In our ana-
lysis, we did not adjust for alcohol intake because alcohol consumption
was considered in the construction of the MedDietScore (Karayiannis
et al., 2017). In addition, we did not control for number of embryos
transferred, because embryo and transfer outcomes could be con-
sidered to be downstream consequences of dietary exposure that
could mediate in part any observed relation with clinical end-points
(implantation, clinical pregnancy and live birth), and therefore it would
be inappropriate to adjust for this intermediate (Messerlian and
Gaskins, 2017). Finally, due to the observational study design, causal
inference is limited.
A main strength of our study is the evaluation of compliance to the
MedDiet by implementing an a-priori dietary pattern approach
(MedDietScore) that captures pre-defined healthy habits and has the
advantage of relying on the current scientific data concerning nutrition,
health and disease. Of note, median MedDietScore values in our
cohort of infertile couples are comparable to values estimated for
healthy
adults
in
corresponding
studies
of
Greek
population
(Chrysohoou et al., 2004). Another strength of this study is that only
women with a BMI < 30 kg/m2 receiving their first IVF treatment were
included. Obese women undergoing IVF require higher gonadotrophin
doses and longer stimulation duration, have lower implantation, clinical
intrauterine gestation and live birth rates, and increased rates of preg-
nancy loss (Luke, 2017). In regard to this, in a study involving >4600
women with a fresh autologous IVF, women with a BMI > 30 kg/m2
had up to 68% lower odds of having a live birth compared with those
with BMI < 30 kg/m2 (Moragianni et al., 2012). Consequently, given
the high impact of obesity on assisted reproductive performance, it is
likely that any influences of diet quality would be more difficult to
detect among women with obesity problems. Finally, the long follow-
up period of couples (up to giving live birth) allowed us to evaluate not
only intermediate but also final IVF outcomes.
In conclusion, we have shown that higher adherence to the MedDiet
is associated with increased chance of clinical pregnancy and live birth
after IVF/ICSI treatment in non-obese women <35 years of age. More
research and intervention studies are warranted to investigate the role of
diet quality in assisted reproductive performance, to reveal underlying
