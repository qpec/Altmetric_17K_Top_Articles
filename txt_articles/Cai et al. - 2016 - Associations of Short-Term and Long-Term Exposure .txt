ardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the 
world. It is responsible for ≈30% of all deaths or ≈17.5 mil-
lion people in 2012.1 As the major risk factor for cardiovascular 
disease, hypertension has been identified as the most important 
cause of disability and the leading risk factor for death globally 
and causes ≈16.5% of all deaths.2 The causes of hypertension are 
complex and are related to genetic factors, lifestyle, diet struc-
ture, and environmental factors, including air pollution.3 Since 
the 1990s, many epidemiological studies have investigated the 
associations between air pollution exposure and hypertension. 
However, the results remain controversial. Some studies have 
shown an association,4–8 whereas other studies have found either 
no association or an association only for selected pollutants or 
limitation based on short-term or long-term exposure.9–12 These 
inconsistent and controversial results indicate the need to quanti-
tatively synthesize and interpret the available evidence to provide 
more explicit information for policy decisions and clinical use. 
Meta-analysis is the most commonly used statistical technique to 
quantitatively synthesize results from ≥2 separate studies.13 To our 
knowledge, there is only one meta-analysis that summarized the 
association between exposure to traffic-related air pollution and 
hypertension.14 However, this study included only cohort studies 
conducted in the Europe and mainly focused on the traffic-related 
air pollutants, which might limit the external validity of their find-
ings. Therefore, more such meta-analyses are urgently needed.
The previous published studies on hypertension and air pol-
lution can be broadly divided into 2 categories: short-term and 
long-term studies. The former estimate the acute effects of air 
pollution exposure and mostly include time-series analyses over 
a few days. The latter evaluate the chronic effects of air pollu-
tion, such as cohort survival analyses over years of exposure.15

Abstract—Hypertension is a major disease of burden worldwide. Previous studies have indicated that air pollution might 
be a risk factor for hypertension, but the results were controversial. To fill this gap, we performed a meta-analysis of 
epidemiological studies to investigate the associations of short-term and long-term exposure to ambient air pollutants 
with hypertension. We searched all of the studies published before September 1, 2015, on the associations of ozone 
(O3), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NO2 and NOX), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and particulate matter (PM10 and 
PM2.5) with hypertension in the English electronic databases. A pooled odds ratio (OR) for hypertension in association 
with each 10 μg/m3 increase in air pollutant was calculated by a random-effects model (for studies with significant 
heterogeneity) or a fixed-effect model (for studies without significant heterogeneity). A total of 17 studies examining the 
effects of short-term (n=6) and long-term exposure (n=11) to air pollutants were identified. Short-term exposure to SO2 
(OR=1.046, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.012–1.081), PM2.5 (OR=1.069, 95% CI: 1.003–1.141), and PM10 (OR=1.024, 
95% CI: 1.016–1.032) were significantly associated with hypertension. Long-term exposure (a 10 μg/m3 increase) 
to NO2 (OR=1.034, 95% CI: 1.005–1.063) and PM10 (OR=1.054, 95% CI: 1.036–1.072) had significant associations 
with hypertension. Exposure to other ambient air pollutants (short-term exposure to NO2, O3, and CO and long-term 
exposure to NOx, PM2.5, and SO2) also had positive relationships with hypertension, but lacked statistical significance. 
Our results suggest that short-term or long-term exposure to some air pollutants may increase the risk of hypertension.

nonmutually exclusive biological mechanisms, that is, direct and 
indirect effects on the sympathetic nervous system, oxidative 
stress, endothelial and other hemodynamic function, and vascular 
tone.16–19 Explicating the differences between the short-term and 
long-term effects of air pollution could provide further informa-
tion for policy makers and clinical prevention for hypertension.
The aim of our study was to systematically review the associa-
tions between air pollutants and risk of hypertension and quantify 
the short-term and long-term effects of ambient air pollutants on 
hypertension risk using a meta-analysis. Our hypothesis was that 
an increase in ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide 
(NO2 and NOX), sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter (PM10), 
and PM2.5 is associated with an increase in the risk of hypertension.
Methods
Search and Review Strategy
We searched the MEDLINE, PUBMED, Web of Science, EMBASE, 
China Biological Medicine, and Wanfang databases for all of the studies 
published before September 1, 2015. Our search strategy used a combi-
nation of keywords related to air pollution exposure (air pollution, par-
ticulate matter, fine particulate matter, particles, fine particles, carbon 
monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, ozone, CO, 
PM, PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, O3, NOX) and hypertension (high blood 
pressure, hypertension, high BP, and hypertensive disease). We also 
manually searched the references of every primary study for additional 
publications. Further publications were also identified by examining the 
review articles. Only publications in English were included in this study.
Study Selection
Two reviewers (Yuanyuan Cai and Bo Zhang) independently searched 
and selected all of the studies. They initially screened all of the study 
titles and abstracts. Studies were excluded if they did not address the 
associations between air pollutants and hypertension. The remaining 
studies were marked as potentially eligible, and their full texts were 
further evaluated. Only the studies that defined hypertension using at 
least one of the following definitions were included: (1) systolic blood 
pressure ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg; (2) use 
of antihypertensive drugs; (3) self-reported doctor-diagnosed hyper-
tension; (4) definition according to the International Classification of 
Disease, 10th revision for hypertension (ICD10: I10), or (5) definition

process.

according to ICD9: 401. The studies were not included in this meta-
analysis if they were animal studies, duplicates, reviews, case reports, 
case series, studies involving only blood pressure, and studies without 
original data or enough quantitative data. Disagreements about the eli-
gible studies were resolved by a discussion between the authors.
A total of 5687 records were identified through searching the database. 
After screening the titles, abstracts, bibliographic references, commentar-
ies, and editorials of the articles, 167 studies were considered potentially 
eligible studies, and the full-text articles were retrieved and reviewed. Of 
these, 149 studies were further excluded because they were not related to 
hypertension and air pollution or they did not provide the dose–response 
relationship between air pollutants and hypertension (n=116), they did 
not provide sufficient data for analysis (n=31), or they were repeated 
studies (n=3). Finally, 17 studies were included in this meta-analysis and 
contained >108 thousand hypertension cases and 220 thousand controls. 
The study selection process is presented in detail in Figure 1.
Quality Evaluation
All of the included studies were evaluated by a quality scale from New 
Castle Ottawa.20 Using this scale, each study is evaluated by 8 items 
that are categorized into 3 groups: the selection of the study groups, 
the comparability of the groups, and the ascertainment of either the 
exposure or outcome of interest for case–control or cohort studies, 
respectively. Each item was graded for a maximum score of 1 points, 
except that related to comparability, which allowed for 2 points. The 
total score ranged from 0 points (lowest) to 9 points (highest), with a 
higher score indicating a higher quality. Two investigators were asked 
to evaluate the quality independently. In the case of a disagreement, a 
third investigator was consulted. In this study, the average Newcastle–
Ottawa scores were 6.3, 6.0, and 6.5 for all 17 included studies, short-
term and long-term exposure studies (Tables 1 and 2).
Data Extraction
We first divided all included studies into short-term and long-term 
studies. The former included time-series and case-crossover studies 
that assessed study subjects’ exposure to air pollution and estimated 
their acute effects on hypertension risk over several days.6–9,21,22 The 
latter were defined as studies that assessed study subjects’ average 
exposure to air pollution and evaluated their chronic effects over years, 
including cross-sectional, cohort, and case–control studies.4,5,10,12,23–29
We used a standardized table to extract the following information 
from all of the included articles: authors, publication year, study set-
ting, study population, study duration, study design, short-term or 
long-term effect, exposure measurement method, data source, num-
ber of controls and cases, type of air pollution, exposure mean and 
range, adjusted odds ratio (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs), adjusted covariates, and the number of lag days for short-effect 
if applicable. Eligibility assessments and all of the data extraction 
were checked and verified by consensus of the 2 investigators. In a 
case of discordance, a third reviewer was asked to give his opinion.
Quantitative Data Synthesis
Before performing the meta-analysis, all of the air pollutant con-
centration units such as ppb (parts per billion) were transformed to 
μg/m3. After their risk estimates (ORs) were converted to a com-
mon exposure unit increase (10 μg/m3), we were able to summa-
rize the estimates from different studies. To evaluate the short-term 
effects of air pollution exposure, some studies took into account 
different lag patterns using single-day lags from lag 0 to 7 days.6,9,22 
Other studies have used both single-day lag and cumulative lag 
pattern.7,8 Nevertheless, most of the included studies use a single-
day lag pattern. Thus, we used the single-day lag pattern to assess 
the associations between short-term exposure to air pollutants and 
hypertension risk. If several lag estimates were reported in the same 
article, we chose the most frequently used in the studies. In this 
study, we chose lag 1 for the short-term effects of O3 and CO, lag 
2 for PM10, lag 3 for NO2 and SO2, and lag 6 for PM2.5. Long-term 
studies evaluated the long-term impact of chronic exposure to air 
pollutants on the risk of hypertension, such as cohort studies over 
years of exposure.24,26 All of the included studies verified the lin-
earity assumption concerning the association between air pollutant 
exposure and hypertension risk.

ciations of short-term and long-term exposure to air pollutants with

hypertension risk. To explore the possible heterogeneity between the 
study results, we hypothesized that the effect size might differ accord-
ing to the methodological quality of the studies. The heterogeneity of 
the included studies was evaluated by using the Q statistic and I2 statis-
tic. Cochran’s Q statistic was calculated by summing the squares of the 
deviations of the estimates from each study of the overall meta-analysis 
estimate by weighting each study’s contribution. A P value was obtained 
by comparing the Q statistic with a χ2 distribution with k−1 degrees of 
freedom, where k was the number of included studies.30 If the P value 
was <0.05, then a random-effects model was selected; otherwise, a 
fixed-effect model was selected. The I2 statistic [I2=(Q−df)/Q×100] 
describes the percentage of the variation across the studies that is 
because of heterogeneity rather than chance. A value of I2>50% dem-
onstrated that there is a statistically significant heterogeneity.30 To test 
the impacts of methods selection on the results of meta-analyses, we 
separately estimated the combined effects of air pollutants using a ran-
dom-effects model and a fixed-effect model.13 We also used funnel plot 
asymmetry to detect the potential publication bias. An Egger’s regres-
sion was applied to test the funnel plot symmetry, in which the inverse 
of the standard error was the independent variable and the standardized 
estimate of the effect size was the dependent variable.31
We also used a series of sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of our 
results. Because some meta-analyses included few studies, we only con-
ducted sensitivity analyses for the meta-analyses that included >3 studies. 
For each sensitivity analysis, we individually removed the single studies 
with the largest and the smallest estimates from the meta-analyses.
Finally, a meta-regression model was used to investigate the pos-
sible modification effects of age on the effect sizes of air pollution, 
which could provide more information on the sources of heterogene-
ity between included studies.
All of the statistical tests were 2-sided, and P<0.05 was consid-
ered statistically significant. We used R software (version 3.2.2; R 
Development Core Team 2012, www.R-project.org) to analyze the 
data, and the package matafor was used.
Results
Definition of Hypertension
Of the 17 included studies, 3 studies defined hypertension 
as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg and diastolic blood 
pressure ≥90 mm Hg4,24,25; 5 studies defined hypertension 
according to the ICD9 or ICD10 code6–9,21; 2 studies used 
self-reported doctor-diagnosed hypertension5,27; and 7 studies 
used >1 methods to define the hypertension cases10,12,21,23,26,28,29 
(Tables 1 and 2).
Assessment of Air Pollution Exposure 
Measurements
Most of the studies (12/17) assessed the air pollutant con-
centrations using routine air pollutant data from central air 
pollution monitoring stations.4,6,7,9,10,12,21,22,24–26 The air pollut-
ant concentrations were selected from the monitoring station 
nearest to the individual’s residence or were calculated using 
the average concentrations in a region where there were >1 
monitoring stations. Four studies assessed the air pollution 
exposure using complex dispersion models or land use regres-
sion models that included various databases, including traffic, 
meteorology, roadway geometry, vehicle emission, air quality 
monitoring data, and land use.5,23,28,29 These models could esti-
mate each subject’s exposure level with high accuracy. One 
study used both data from central air pollution monitoring sta-
tions and self-monitoring data8 (Tables 1 and 2).
Associations Between Short-Term Exposure to Air 
Pollutants and Hypertension Risk
A total of 6 studies investigated the relationships between 
short-term exposure to air pollutants and hypertension.6–9,21,22 
Of these studies, 5 were case-crossover studies and one was 
time-series study. Two studies were conducted in China, 2 in 
Canada, and 2 in Brazil and Iran. Four studies evaluated PM10 
and 3 evaluated SO2, NO2, or PM2.5. The number of lag days 
ranged from 1 to 7 per pollutant and per study (Table 1).
The results of meta-analyses showed that hypertension 
was significantly associated with short-term exposure to SO2

(OR=1.046, 95% CI: 1.012–1.081), PM2.5 (OR=1.069, 95% 
CI: 1.003–1.141), and PM10 (OR= 1.024, 95% CI: 1.017–
1.030) in each 10 μg/m3 increment. We also observed a mar-
ginally statistically significant association between short-term 
exposure NO2 (OR=1.037, 95% CI: 0.994–1.082) and hyper-
tension risk (Figure 2). In particular, there were only 2 studies 
that explored the effects of short-term exposure to CO and O3 
on hypertension, which limited us to summarize the pooled 
effect estimates using a meta-analysis. For the 2 studies that 
investigated the short-term effects of CO, neither Szyszkowicz 
et al (OR=1.0002, 95% CI: 0.9992–1.0012)7 nor Qorbani et 
al (OR=1.0008, 95% CI: 0.9985–1.0031)22 found significant 
results. For the 2 studies that assessed the short-term effects 
of O3, none of them (OR=1.007 [95% CI: 0.980–1.032] for 
Szyszkowiczet al’s study7 and OR=1.000 [95% CI: 0.969–
1.032] for Brook et al’ study9) found significant associations.
Associations Between Long-Term Exposure to Air 
Pollutants and Hypertension Risk
Eleven studies assessed the associations of long-term exposure 
to air pollutants with hypertension.4,5,10,12,23–29 Of these studies, 
the most common epidemiological designs were cross-sectional 
(n=5) and cohort studies (n=4). Two other studies were case–
control designs. Three studies were conducted in China, 2 in the 
United States, 2 in Sweden, and 4 in Germany, Spain, Canada, 
or Denmark. Six studies evaluated the effects of NO2, 5 studies 
evaluated PM2.5, 4 evaluated NO2, and 3 evaluated PM10 (Table 2).
There was a statistically significant increase in hypertension risk in 
association with each 10 μg/m3 increment in long-term exposure 
to NO2 (OR=1.034, 95% CI: 1.005–1.063) and PM10 (OR=1.034, 
95% CI: 1.005–1.063). We did not find statistically significant 
associations of hypertension with NOx (OR=1.127, 95% CI: 
0.933–1.361) and PM2.5 (OR=1.065, 95% CI: 0.985–1.152), but 
their OR values indicated the possible increased risks of hyperten-
sion associated with NOx and PM2.5 exposure (Figure 2). Only 2 
studies assessed the long-term effects of SO2 on hypertension, but 
both of them observed statistically significant associations. Chan 
et al observed a 73.2% increase (OR=1.732, 95% CI: 1.309–
2.308) in hypertension risk associated with a 10 μg/m3 increment 
in long-term exposure to SO2
4, and Dong et al found that the 
OR between a 10 μg/m3 increment in SO2 concentration and 
hypertension was 1.054 (95% CI: 1.020–1.086).25
Sensitivity Analyses
The meta-analysis results were generally robust for the exclu-
sion of single studies that had the largest or smallest effect size 
with regard to the significance of the estimated associations, 
but there was one exception (Figure S1 in the online-only Data 
Supplement). The pooled effect estimate (OR=1.065, 95% CI: 
0.985–1.152) for hypertension, with a 10 μg/m3 increase in long-
term PM2.5 exposure became statistically significant (OR=1.098, 
95% CI: 1.015–1.188) after excluding the study with the smallest 
effect size. We also observed that selection of fixed-effect model 
or random-effects model did not significantly change the results 
of meta-analyses, although some CIs of ORs were wider in some 
meta-analyses using a random-effects model (Figures S2 and S3).
Heterogeneity Analyses and Publication Bias 
Analyses
The heterogeneity analyses revealed that most of the meta-anal-
yses did not have significant heterogeneity between included 
studies except for the analyses of short-term exposure to NO2 
and PM2.5 and long-term exposure to NOX and PM2.5 (Figure 2). 
Age might be an important source of heterogeneity between 
studies. The results of meta-regression analyses showed that the 
age of study population was significantly negatively associated 
with the effect sizes of long-term exposure to NO2 (β=−0.007, 
P=0.021) and PM2.5 (β=−0.004, P=0.049; Figure S4). The 
results of Egger’s tests showed that there was no significant 
publication bias in the meta-analyses (Figure S5).

Discussion
Hypertension remains a worldwide public health chal-
lenge.32,33 Ascertaining the risk factors of hypertension could 
provide significant information for the prevention of hyper-
tension and cardiovascular diseases.34 In this meta-analysis, 
we quantitatively assessed the associations between short-
term and long-term exposure to ambient air pollutants and the 
risk of hypertension. We observed that short-term exposure 
to SO2, PM2.5, and PM10 and long-term exposure to NO2 and 
PM10 were associated with an increase in hypertension risk. To 
our knowledge, this is the first study to simultaneously esti-
mate the effects of short-term and long-term exposure to air 
pollutants on hypertension by meta-analysis. Our findings are 
consistent with the results of 2 previous meta-analyses that 
summarized the associations between air pollution exposure 
during pregnancy and pregnancy-induced hypertensive disor-
ders.35,36 Pedersen et al found that pregnancy-induced hyper-
tensive disorders were significantly associated with a 5 μg/m3 
increment in PM2.5 (OR=1.57; 95% CI: 1.26–1.96), a 10-μg/
m3 increment in NO2 (OR=1.20; 95% CI: 1.00–1.44), and a 
10 μg/m3 increment in PM10 (OR=1.13; 95% CI: 1.02–1.26).35 
Given the enormous prevalence of hypertension37 and the ubiq-
uitous nature of ambient air pollution exposure,38 we speculate 
that our findings between air pollutants and hypertension are 
of considerable and growing global public health importance.
The mechanisms by which air pollution exposure could 
contribute to the development of hypertension might include 
systemic inflammation and oxidative stress,39 which may 
cause increased sympathetic tone and potentially lead to arte-
rial remodeling.40 Schins et al observed that when rats were 
exposed to PM2.5, their blood endotoxin content, interleukin-8 
and tumor necrosis factor-α levels increased significantly.41 
Oxidative stress may also increase the circulation of activated 
inflammatory cytokines, which may subsequently induce 
endothelial dysfunction, lead to an imbalance in vascular 
homeostatic response, and result in total peripheral resistance 
and a fixation of evaluated blood pressure.40,42 PM may also 
elevate blood pressure by inducing autonomic nervous sys-
tem imbalance and vasoconstriction.24 In addition, PM expo-
sure can also reduce daytime sodium excretion and blunt the 
normal nocturnal reduction in blood pressure. If this happens 
repeatedly, the impaired renal handling of excess sodium may 
partly contribute to elevated blood pressure.43
Discrepancies between the magnitudes of short-term and 
long-term exposure effects have been a particular concern in air 
pollution and health studies.44 In this study, we observed that the 
short-term PM10 exposure–hypertension association (OR=1.023, 
95% CI: 1.017–1.029) was substantially lower than the equivalent 
long-term association (OR=1.054, 95% CI: 1.036–1.072). This 
result was consistent with certain previous study findings.44,45 For 
example, in the Renfrew–Paisley cohort study, Beverland et al 
found that a 10 μg/m3 increase in average black smoke over 3 
days (short-term) was associated with a 1.8% (95% CI: 0.1%–
3.4%) increase in all-cause mortality compared with an estimate 
of a 10% (95% CI: 4%–17%) increase in mortality risk for a 10 
μg/m3 increase in average black smoke from 1970 to 1979 (long-
term).45 This discrepancy might be because of several reasons. 
Short-term exposure studies capture only part of the total effects 
of long-term repeated exposure to air pollution.44 Some other 
authors proposed that the larger magnitudes of the association 
between long-term exposure and health may be attributable to 
cumulative effects that increase the sensitivity of highly exposed 
population subgroups.45 However, we also observed similar esti-
mates in the magnitudes of the effects of short- and long-term 
exposures to PM2.5 and NO2. The reasons for these inconsistent 
results remain unclear and may be related to differences in study 
populations, lag patterns, races, regions, exposure assessment 
methods, the constituents of PM, and the confounders adjust-
ment between studies.46,47 Therefore, more studies are needed 
in the future to explore the differences of short-term and long-
term air pollution exposure effects on human health.
Our results also demonstrated that both short-term and 
long-term exposure to PM2.5 has a more pronounced effect 
than PM10 on hypertension risk in each 10 μg/m3 increase. 
Studies investigating the adverse effects of PM on other health 
outcomes, such as mortality48 and respiratory diseases,49 also 
observed these types of results. Compared with PM10, PM2.5 
can remain suspended for a longer time in the air and be inhaled 
into the respiratory tract and directly into the pulmonary alve-
oli. In addition, PM2.5 has a larger superficial area and hence 
absorbs more chemical constituents than PM10. Therefore, 
PM2.5 is probably more harmful on human health than PM10.8,50
We did not find statistically significant associations of 
hypertension with short-term exposure to NO2 and long-term 
exposure to NOx. The lower statistical power caused by the 
fewer number of included studies may be one of the possible 
reasons. Only 3 and 4 studies were selected to estimate the 
pooled effects of NO2 and NOx on hypertension, respectively. 
In particular, the associations of hypertension with short-
term exposure to CO and O3 and long-term exposure to SO2 
were independently assessed by only 2 studies. The number 
of the included studies was too small to permit us to quanti-
tatively summarize the pooled associations by meta-analysis. 
However, a previous meta-analysis observed the significant 
associations of hypertensive disorder of pregnancy with CO 
and O3 exposure during the pregnancy.36 For example, a 1 ppm 
increase in average CO exposure during the first trimester was 
associated with a 79% (95% CI: 31%–145%) increase in the 
risk of hypertensive disorder during pregnancy.36 These results 
indicate that more research is needed in the future to confirm 
the possible effects of CO, O3, SO2, and NOx on hypertension.
The results of the heterogeneity analyses showed significant 
heterogeneity for some analyses, including shot-term exposure 
to NO2 and PM2.5 and long-term exposure to NOx and PM2.5 
analyses. However, all of the analyses showed increased ORs. 
Therefore, the heterogeneity reflected differences in the magni-
tude rather than differences in the direction of the associations. 
The heterogeneity between the included studies may reflect dif-
ferences in the study settings, study design, exposure assessment, 
constituents of PM, and confounder adjustment, which may 
influence the variation in exposure to air pollution and potentially 
cause different dose–response relationships.46,47 In addition, we 
found that age was negatively associated with effect sizes of air 
pollution, which indicated that age might be an important source 
of heterogeneity between studies. The protective effect of age 
might be related to the different medication use between young 
age and elderly.51 It was found that older people usually use more 
medication than young people, and not taking medication was

a strong predictor of increased blood pressure effects for both 
systolic and pulse pressure.7,51 To reduce the impact of hetero-
geneity, we used a random-effects model to combine the indi-
vidual study’s finding.30 A subgroup analysis is an important tool 
to explore the sources of between-study heterogeneity. However, 
the few number (n<5) of included studies with significant hetero-
geneity prevented us from conducting such analyses.
Our study has several limitations that should be consid-
ered. First, there are few studies on air pollutants, such as CO 
and O3, which prevented us from conducting a meta-analysis 
and subgroup analysis. We cannot rule out the possibility that 
our current results are chance findings and that the absence of 
publication bias is because of the relatively small number of 
included primary studies. Second, most included studies used 
a single-pollutant model despite the fact that there are possi-
ble interactions between pollutants. Multipollutant models are 
difficult to implement and validate. Therefore, we indepen-
dently estimated the association between each pollutant and 
hypertension risk based on the single-pollutant model results 
and did not evaluate the interactions between the air pollut-
ants. More studies are needed in the future to take into account 
more factors, such as individual-level covariates and interac-
tions between pollutants, and to explore the source-specific 
effects of particulate matter, such as elemental compositions.
Perspectives
To our knowledge, this meta-analysis is the first study to assess 
the quality and magnitude of the associations between air expo-
sure and the risk of hypertension. Our results provide strong evi-
dence that both short-term and long-term exposure to the main 
air pollutants increases the risk of hypertension. Our findings 
are of public health importance because both air pollution and 
hypertension are important worldwide public health problems.
Even though a small risk of hypertension is induced by the air 
pollution exposure, it may bring a large population-attributable 
disease burden of hypertension because of the ubiquitous nature 
of air pollution. Therefore, if these exposures are avoided, they 
theoretically could reduce the incidence of hypertension.

What Is New?
• First meta-analysis on both short-term and long-term effects of air pol-
lution on hypertension.
• Short-term exposure to SO2, PM2.5, and PM10 is significantly associated 
with the risk of hypertension.
• Long-term exposure to NO2 and PM10 is associated with the risk of hy-
pertension.
What Is Relevant?
• The effects of some air pollutants on hypertension are still controversial, 
and more researches with advanced study designs and methodologies 
are needed in the future.
Summary
This meta-analysis is the first study to assess the quality and mag-
nitude of the associations between air exposure and the risk of 
hypertension. Our findings provide strong evidence that both short-
term and long-term exposure to the main air pollutants increases 
the risk of hypertension.
