SUMMARY
Understanding the immune compartment of tumors
facilitates the development of revolutionary new
therapies. We used a Kras(G12D)-driven mouse
model of lung cancer to establish an immune signa-
ture and identified a contribution of Gr1+ neutrophils
to
disease
progression.
Depletion
experiments
showed that Gr1+ cells (1) favor tumor growth, (2)
reduce T cell homing and prevent successful anti-
PD1 immunotherapy, and (3) alter angiogenesis,
leading to hypoxia and sustained Snail expression
in lung cancer cells. In turn, Snail accelerated disease
progression and increased intratumoral Cxcl2 secre-
tion and neutrophil infiltration. Cxcl2 was produced
mainly by neutrophils themselves in response to a
factor secreted by Snail-expressing tumor cells. We
therefore propose a vicious cycle encompassing
neutrophils and Snail to maintain a deleterious tumor
microenvironment.
INTRODUCTION
Over the past 20 years, tumor infiltration by multiple immune cell
populations has been shown to predict patient outcomes for
many solid tumor types, and the concept of cancer immuno-
therapy enables new treatment strategies. Lung cancer is the
leading cause of cancer-associated deaths (Ferlay et al.,
2015), and first-line immunotherapy-based clinical trials yielded
promising results in lung cancer patients with extensive (>50%)
expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL1) in the tumor
cells (22%–28% of patients) (Reck et al., 2016). This heteroge-
neous response rate, however, suggests that the anti-tumor
response cannot be harnessed in all non-small-cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) cases. Formation of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs)
concomitantly with lung cancer development indicates the pres-
ence of an active immune response (Goc et al., 2013). Previously,
powerful predictions of patients’ outcomes have been obtained
by interrogating the impact of multiple immune cell populations
together, exemplified in colon cancer (Galon et al., 2006).
Along the same line, mapping the immune compartment of
lung tumors could allow better understanding of the immuno-
logic circuits active in this malignancy. Indeed, considering the
interplay between the different components of the tumor micro-
environment and the carcinoma cells is essential to deciphering
mechanisms driving cancer progression. For example, blood
vessels and endothelial cells not only provide oxygen and nutri-
ents but also govern immune cell extravasation into the tumor
mass. Although the expression of Fas ligand (FasL) by endothe-
lial cells impairs immune cell extravasation (Zhang et al., 2005;
Motz et al., 2014), a high endothelial venule (HEV)-like phenotype
facilitates immune cell adhesion and infiltration into inflamed
sites, including tumors (Martinet et al., 2012).
Numerous soluble factors produced by cancer cells can also
directly influence the intratumor immune compartment. For
example, cancer cells undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal tran-
sition (EMT), a developmental process contributing to metas-
tasis formation in many solid tumor types, display an immuno-
suppressive phenotype, as they secrete cytokines, notably
TGF-b, which support the differentiation of regulatory T cells
(Tregs) (Kudo-Saito et al., 2009).
In line with this, the key EMT transcription factor Snail can
exert a protumorigenic influence on several immune cell popula-
tions, directly activating the expression of cytokines contributing
to the recruitment of tumor-promoting M2 macrophages via
CCL2 and CCL5 (Hsu et al., 2014), while impairing the function
of dendritic cells and inducing Treg differentiation (Kudo-Saito
et al., 2009).

 Studying this complex interplay among carcinoma cells, stro-
mal cells, and the immune compartment requires fully immuno-
competent animals. In our work, we used the inducible model
of mutant KrasLSL-G12D/WT; p53FL/FL-driven lung adenocarci-
noma (KP) (Jackson et al., 2005), in which tumors are considered
poorly immunogenic because they are refractory to immune
checkpoint blockade (anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4) immunotherapy
(Pfirschke et al., 2016).
RESULTS
A Dynamic Immune Response Occurs in KP Tumors
In KP mice, adaptive immunity partially controls disease pro-
gression, as KP-Ragko tumors, obtained by crossing KP mice
in a Rag1-deficient background, displayed accelerated growth
compared with normal KP tumors (Figure S1A). To elucidate
the immune microenvironment in KP tumors, we monitored im-
mune cell localization using immunofluorescence (IF). Most of
the immune cells resided outside the tumor mass, forming
aggregates of CD45+ cells, and were in close proximity with tu-
mors, blood vessels, and airways. Those lymphoid structures
were composed mostly of B cells (B220+) and CD4+ and CD8+
T lymphocytes surrounded by macrophages (F4/80+) and Gr1
(Ly6G-C) positive cells. To a lower extent, we also found all of
these immune populations isolated or as small clusters infil-
trating the tumor mass (Figure 1A).
We then aimed to establish an immune signature from the KP
tumors by flow cytometry. To this end, we developed a 16-color
flow cytometry staining allowing the identification of 60 immune
cell populations and monitored the immune infiltration in 54 re-
sected tumors ranging from very small (9 mg) to very large
(330 mg) (Figure 1B). We manually analyzed the flow cytometry
data using an exclusion-based rational gating strategy in which
each event can be annotated only once and almost 100% of
the immune cells are assigned to one of the subpopulations
(Figures 1C, S1B, and S1C).
The resulting average immune compartment (CD45+ cells)
was
characterized
by
a
predominance
of
myeloid
cells
(51% ± 10%), composed mostly of CD11b+Ly6G+Ly6C+ neutro-
phils (17.9% ± 10.2%), F4/80+ macrophages (15.4% ± 9.6%),
and CD11c+ dendritic cells (DCs; 15.3% ± 9.6%). Four DC
subpopulations could be distinguished regarding CD11b and
CD103 expression. Most of the major histocompatibility com-
plex class II (MHC-II) (IA/IE)+CD80+-activated antigen-present-
ing cells (8.9% ± 6.3% of the immune compartment) were found
among CD11b+ DCs and macrophages. Ly6C+CD11cintCD11b+
cells and CD11b+Ly6Chi monocytes were rare (1.8% ± 0.9%
and 2.3% ± 1.6%, respectively). Lymphoid cells represented
37% ± 12% of the immune compartment and were composed
mostly of CD3+ T lymphocytes (19.4% ± 11.7%) and B220+
CD19+ B lymphocytes (11.6% ± 7.8%). In these tumors,
NK1.1+ natural killer (NK) cells and NK-T cells were rare
(2% ± 1.5% and 0.1% ± 0.08%, respectively). Among the
CD4+ T cells (11.4% ± 6.1%), the FoxP3+ Tregs (7.9% of CD4+
T cells) contained a strong proportion of CD103+IA/IE+ cells,
and the proportion of CD8+ T cells was low (3.3% ± 3.4%) (Fig-
ure 1D; Table S1). The immune signature from tumors compared
with healthy lung differed substantially (Figure S1D). Additionally,
we observed a strong inverse correlation between the proportion
of immune cells (CD45+) and tumor size (Figure S1E).
The Immune Signature Predicts Tumor Size and
Identifies Neutrophils as Potential Contributors of
Disease Progression
HistopathologicalanalysesofKPlungsectionsrevealedheteroge-
neity of lesions,as benign and advanced lesions were found within
the same animal, with the most advanced histological grades
(adenocarcinoma grades 4 and 5) predominantly found in the
largest tumors (Figures S2A and S2B). We therefore hypothesized
that we can identify changes in the immune signature that are
associated with tumor progression and inter-lesion heterogeneity.
To validate the accuracy of the method, we first analyzed
tumors with a putatively different immune compartment. To do
so, we generated a model of immunogenic KP tumors (desig-
nated KP-Im), in which the lentiviral vector used for tumor
initiation codes for GFP-ovalbumin (OVA) in addition to Cre,
mimicking tumor cell-specific expression of strong tumor anti-
gens. Consistently with previous immunogenic KP models (Du-
Page et al., 2011), micro-computed tomographic (mCT) imaging
revealed a delayed growth of KP-Im compared with KP tumors
(Figure S2C). We also analyzed KP tumors of mice treated with
pemetrexed (KP-Pem), a conventional chemotherapy, to model
a chemically driven systemic impact on the host. The compari-
son with KP tumors revealed detectable changes in the compo-
sition of infiltrating immune cells in KP-Im and KP-Pem tumors
(Figure S2D; Tables S1 and S2). Unsupervised clustering of the
samples on the basis of their immune signature correctly as-
signed them to their respective group in most cases (Figure S2E).
Among normal KP tumors, unsupervised sample clustering on
the basis of the abundance of 48 immune cell populations gener-
ated three groups (small [S], Mix1, and Mix2), stratifying tumors
according to their weight (Figure 2A). Because multistep gating
such as the manual exclusion-based gating strategy described
above relies on the selection of specific markers to define im-
mune populations, and the gating itself can be criticized for its
subjectivity, we developed an automated algorithm, MegaClust
(http://megaclust.vital-it.ch), which identifies cell populations
from complex cytometry datasets (see Supplemental Experi-
mental Procedures). An evaluation of the quality of each
cell population identified by MegaClust was included in the
workflow and performed considering (1) its proximity to the filtra-
tion gates (manual selection of viable CD45+ immune cells), (2)

 the proportion of samples’ events displaying that population,
and (3) its uni-modality on every marker expression. We
observed that 43% of MegaClust cell populations were flagged
by this quality control, whereas 71% of the populations identified
by the gold-standard method viSNE and SPADE were pointed
out using the same method (Figures S3A–S3C). Unsupervised hi-
erarchical clustering of the samples on the basis of MegaClust
generated four clusters of samples, with two of them containing
only small tumors (Small1, n = 5; Small2, n = 13) and two
composed of big tumors (Big1, n = 19; Big2, n = 17) (Figure 2B).
MegaClust immune signature-derived groups of samples gave a
better stratification of tumors regarding their size than manual
gating or viSNE and SPADE, which identified a group (V+S 5,
n = 19) containing all the biggest lesions (Figure S3D).
To enable a global interpretation, each individual population
identified by MegaClust is grouped in families, on the basis of
their similarity from hierarchical clustering, and each level of
analysis (samples, families, and populations) is represented in
a single graph called a dreamcatcher plot. The dreamcatcher
plot derived from our 54 KP tumor samples revealed (1) NK
and B cell enrichment in Small1 and Small2 compared with
Big1 and Big2, (2) a high proportion of CD8+ T cells unique to
Small1, and (3) a strong infiltration of neutrophils and CD11b�
macrophages specifically in Big2 (Figure 2C). Manual validation
of MegaClust results confirmed these findings (Figure S3E).
On top of predicting tumor size efficiently in tumors originating
from the identical oncogenic event, the immune signature high-
lighted neutrophil enrichment in the biggest tumors. Further-
more, a correlation network between all the immune cell popula-
tions indicated that it is the only immune cell type negatively
correlated with multiple other populations, suggesting a negative
impact of these cells on the anti-tumor immune response
(Figure S3F).
Gr1+ Cell Depletion Reduces Lung Tumor Growth,
Reverts Immune Exclusion, and Sensitizes Lesions to
Anti-PD1 Immunotherapy
To decipher the role of neutrophils in tumors, we aimed at
depleting this population using either an anti-Ly6G or anti-Gr1
(Ly6C/G) antibody (ab) in KP mice with well-established tumors.
The widely used anti-Ly6G ab (1A8) that binds to neutrophils and
masks the Ly6G antigen failed to deplete neutrophils after
1 week of treatment. The anti-Gr1 ab (RB6-8C5) successfully
depleted neutrophils in the blood but also decreased circulating
monocytes (Figures S4A and S4B). Because we required an effi-
cient neutrophil depletion over several weeks, we decided to
pursue our experiments using anti-Gr1 and observed depletion
in tumors up to 3 weeks (Figure S4C). Weekly mCT imaging re-
vealed that Gr1+ cell depletion significantly inhibited tumor
growth; cancer cell proliferation was diminished and tumor
weight was reduced at sacrifice (Figure 3A).
Although neutrophils represent a major population of the tu-
mor immune compartment, Gr1+ cell depletion actually led to
an increased tumor infiltration by CD45+ cells (Figure 3B). Mega-
Clust analysis confirmed the successful depletion of neutrophils
after 2 weeks of anti-Gr1 treatment, and importantly, the dream-
catcher plot revealed a significant increase in CD11b+ cells,
mostly F4/80+ macrophages, indicating that the impact of the
anti-Gr1 ab on circulating monocytes does not interfere with
macrophage and DC homing in KP tumors. Furthermore, CD4+
T cell infiltration was increased, together with a trend toward
CD8+ T cell enrichment (Figure S4D). IF imaging confirmed that
CD8+ and CD4+ T cell infiltration into the tumor mass was signif-
icantly enhanced (Figure 3C). Additionally, CD8+ T cells prolifer-
ated more and Tregs less upon anti-Gr1 treatment (Figure 3D).
Our results hence show that depleting Gr1+ cells triggers a pro-
found remodeling of the immune compartment favoring effector
T cell enrichment into the tumor mass, suggesting that neutro-
phils play a role in establishing the immune exclusion of KP
tumors.
This prompted us to combine Gr1+ cell depletion with anti-PD1
treatment, as the immune exclusion could explain why immune
checkpoint inhibitors are unsuccessful in KP mice (Pfirschke
et al., 2016). Although anti-PD1 treatment alone indeed failed
to alter tumor progression, anti-PD1 following 1 week of anti-
Gr1 led to a stronger reduction of tumor growth compared with
Gr1+ depletion alone, with a regression in 42.8% of the lesions
(Figure 3E). Consistently, cancer cell death revealed by cleaved
caspase-3 (CC3) staining and CD8+ T cell number in the tumor
mass were increased by combination therapy and were corre-
lated together (Figure 3F). In addition, the CD8+ T cells’ produc-
tion of interferon-gamma (IFN-g) was significantly increased
compared with anti-Gr1 alone. The effect of anti-PD1 was linked
to prior Gr1+ cell depletion, as anti-PD1 treatment alone did not
change any of these parameters (Figure S4E). To determine
whether the pro-tumor activity of neutrophils resides only in their
capability to establish an immune exclusion, we treated KP-
Ragko mice with anti-Gr1. Even in absence of adaptive immunity,
Gr1+ cell depletion was still able to reduce tumor growth (Fig-
ure 3G). Therefore, we hypothesized that neutrophils contribute
to disease progression through an additional mechanism.
Gr1+ Cell Infiltration Associates with Blood Vessel
Alteration, Leading to Enhanced Hypoxia and Sustained
Snail Expression in Cancer Cells
Considering a recent report demonstrating that blood vessel
normalization is a prerequisite for efficient immunotherapy in
cancer (Tian et al., 2017), we investigated blood vessel abun-
dance and functionality upon Gr1+ cell depletion. After 2 and
3 weeks of anti-Gr1 treatment, we observed an enrichment of
CD31+ endothelial cells and increased vessel coverage by peri-
cytes (aSMA+) in tumors (Figure 4A). A more detailed analysis of
the endothelial cell phenotype revealed a reduction of FasL and
an increased intensity of MECA-79 staining, suggesting these
vessels are more permissive to immune cell extravasation
(Zhang et al., 2005; Motz et al., 2014), which could explain how
indicated. Family level: peripheral radar plots depict the relative expression of each marker by a specific family (red) compared with the average of all the immune
cells (blue). The family names were attributed considering their expression of every marker. Population level: heatmaps show individual cell populations within the
families on the basis of their deviation from the median expression of each marker across the whole family. White, population is close to the median expression of
this marker across the family; red, high degree of deviation from the median marker expression across the family by a population.

 anti-Gr1 treatment reverts the immune exclusion (Figure 4B).
Because the tumor vasculature is affected by Gr1+ cell depletion,
we speculated that neutrophils contribute to establishing a hyp-
oxic environment. Accordingly, pimonidazole injections revealed
diminished hypoxia in Gr1+ cell depleted tumors (Figure 4C).
In order to determine the consequences on tumor cells, we
sorted CD45� cells from KP tumors, composed mostly of E-cad-
herin-expressing cancer cells, after anti-Gr1 or control ab treat-
ment and performed RNA sequencing. Pathway analysis sug-
gested that Gr1+ cell infiltration enhances cell proliferation
(CDC42RAC) and motility (ACTINY) (Figure 4D).
Because Gr1+ cell depletion alleviates hypoxia in KP tumors, we
assessed the impact of hypoxia in vitro in the human lung cancer
cell lines A549 and H2009. Six days of low oxygen pressure (2%
O2)wassufficienttomodifytheshape ofA549cellsfromanepithe-
lial- to a mesenchymal-like phenotype (not shown). Time course
experiments revealed an increased expression of HIF-1a and
the EMT transcription factor Snail from day 2 in both A549 and
H2009 cells. ZEB1, another EMT transcription factor and a Snail
target, was induced in A549 from day 3. HIF-1a knockdown led
to a reduced hypoxia-mediated Snail induction, as shown previ-
ously in other cell lines (Yang et al., 2008) (Figures 4E and 4F).
In vivo, we detected decreased Snail protein expression as
well as proportion of Snail positive nuclei and lower levels of Snail
mRNA in CD45� cells from anti-Gr1-treated tumors (Figures 4G
and 4H). These results suggest that neutrophil infiltration, by
modifying blood vessels, leads to hypoxia, supporting HIF-1a
stabilization, ultimately enhancing Snail expression by tumor
cells.
Snail Expression in Cancer Cells Accelerates Disease
Progression and Generates Big2-like Tumors
We next wanted to determine whether sustained Snail expres-
sion in tumor cells directly contributes to disease progression.
We silenced endogenous Snail in tumor cells using a lentiviral
vector coding for Cre and a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against
Snail. Whereas sh1 failed to achieve silencing, sh2 significantly
reduced Snail mRNA expression compared with normal KP tu-
mors (Cre) (Figure 5A). sh2 uniquely inhibited tumor growth, as
no big tumors (>70 mg) developed (Figure 5B).
Then we used a modified version of the KP mice, designated
KPR, which express the reverse-tetracycline trans-activator in
the lung epithelium (CCSP-rtTA), enabling doxycycline-depen-
dent transgene expression in lung tumor epithelial cells (Meylan
et al., 2009). Lung tumors were initiated in KPR and KP (littermate
control) mice using lentiviral vectors delivering Cre and doxycy-
cline-inducible Snail. All mice were kept on a doxycycline diet
from the day of infection, facilitating Snail expression in the
KPR lung tumors (Figure 5C). Disease development was acceler-
ated upon Snail expression: the mice showed reduced survival
and a higher proportion of larger and grade 5 tumors and pre-
sented with an increased tumor growth rate with enhanced
Ki67 expression (Figures 5D–5F). The percentage of Hmga2-
positive tumors was increased, while Ttf1 expression was
reduced, indicating loss of tumor differentiation and increased
aggressiveness (Winslow et al., 2011) (Figure S5A). Zeb1 gene
expression was increased in Snail-induced tumors. However,
although there was a trend toward increased N-cadherin
(Cdh2) and vimentin (Vim), we did not observe changes in any
other canonical markers of EMT, including Twist and the epithe-
lial marker E-cadherin (Cdh1) (Figures S5B and S5C). We
observed a modified expression pattern for E-cadherin, with
localization rather in the cytoplasm than at the membrane of
Snail-positive tumor cells, and histopathological analysis re-
vealed a modest increase in EMT incidence (Figures S5D and
S5E). These results altogether point toward the occurrence of
a partial EMT phenotype in which an increase of mesenchymal
traits coincides with the retention of epithelial characteristics.
Interestingly, comparing the immune cell infiltration of tumors
with a similar weight showed that Snail expression by cancer
cells led to an elevated percentage of neutrophils (1.7-fold) and
reduced B cells (0.62-fold) among immune cells (Figure S6A).
By immunohistochemistry with an anti-Ly6G ab, we could
confirm an increase in the absolute number of neutrophils in
tumors overexpressing Snail (Figure 5G).
For the in vivo knockdown experiments, tumors with strong
neutrophil infiltration were absent from the Snail-sh2 group
(Figure 5H), but as a whole there was no significant difference
with control and sh1. Hence, sustained Snail expression in tumor
cells is at least partly mediated by Gr1+ cell infiltration (see
Figures 4G and 4H); in turn, Snail expression in cancer cells gen-
erates Big2-like tumors characterized by a large size and low B
cell and high neutrophil infiltration.
Snail expression in cancer cells can enhance the recruitment
of several immune cell types, such as macrophages (Hsu et al.,
2014) or mast cells (Knab et al., 2014), via cytokine production.
In an effort to elucidate how Snail expression leads to increased
neutrophil infiltration in lung tumors, we assessed the expression

 of several chemokines (Cxcl1, Cxcl2, and Cxcl5) known to recruit
neutrophils. We observed a strong correlation between Snail and
Cxcl2 (p < 0.0001, R2 = 0.832) in KP tumors (Figure S6B). Further-
more, the secretion of Cxcl2 and Cxcl5 was increased in Snail-
expressing tumors (Figure 5I).
To determine the source of these secreted chemokines, we
sorted CD45� and CD45+ cells and observed that the mRNA
expression of each of Cxcl1, Cxcl2, and Cxcl5 was augmented
in both cell compartments of Snail-expressing tumors, with
Cxcl2 expressed mostly by immune cells and Cxcl5 by tumor cells
(Figure S6C). Among tumor-sorted immune cell populations,
Cxcl1 was expressed by monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils,
and DCs, whereas Cxcl2 was produced mostly by neutrophils.
Cxcl1 and Cxcl2 mRNAs were increased specifically in the sorted
neutrophils from Snail tumors (Figure S6D). This suggests a dialog
between Snail-expressing tumor cells and neutrophils, resulting in
the increased production of neutrophil-recruiting chemokines.
We purified neutrophils from healthy lungs and cultured them
in conditioned medium from a murine KP lung cancer cell line
(M8), engineered to allow doxycycline-mediated Snail induction.
Confirming our hypothesis, the conditioned medium from Snail-
expressing cells was able to increase Cxcl1 and Cxcl2 mRNA
abundance in neutrophils ex vivo (Figure 5J). This indicates
that Snail-expressing lung cancer cells release a soluble factor,
which is detected by neutrophils enhancing neutrophil-homing
chemokine production.
Because Snail expression is at least partially dependent on
Gr1+ cell recruitment into tumors, we wanted to explore whether
the pro-tumor activity of Snail could be due to protection against
the adaptive immune response via neutrophil recruitment. We
crossed KPR mice to Rag1-deficient mice, which revealed that
sustained Snail induction increases neutrophil recruitment as in
KP tumors and retains pro-tumor activity in mice lacking an
adaptive immune system (Figure 5K). Moreover, anti-Gr1 treat-
ment failed to reduce the growth rates of Snail-induced tumors
(Figure 5L), demonstrating that Snail favors tumor progression
beyond neutrophil recruitment and immune exclusion.
Big2 KP Tumors Reflect a Population of Poor-Prognosis
Lung Cancer Patients
We used a tissue microarray (TMA) comprising 150 patient sam-
ples with follow-up survival data from the European Thoracic
Oncology Platform (ETOP) to analyze B cell (CD20+), neutrophil
(polymorphonuclear CD15+), and CD8+ T cell abundance as
well as Snail expression. We discovered that a group of patients
(group D) mirroring murine group Big2 tumors, characterized by a
low proportion of B and CD8+ T cells and a high infiltration with
neutrophils, had strongly reduced overall survival (p = 0.0004,
hazard ratio [HR] = 2.93). In contrast, a group of patients
(group A) resembling group Small1, with a high infiltration of
CD8+ T cells and B cells and a low infiltration with neutrophils,
showed a trend toward improved survival (Figures 6A–6D;
Table S3). CD8+ T cell infiltration alone had a tendency toward
a good prognosis (p = 0.1, HR = 0.61), B cell infiltration was not
prognostic, and CD15+ polymorphonuclear neutrophils associ-
ated with an adverse outcome (p = 0.08, HR = 1.71) (Figures
S7A–S7C). In one third of the patients, CD15 was expressed by
the tumor cells (Mohammad et al., 2012), and CD15+ tumor cells
coincided with a trend toward a better survival (p = 0.1, HR = 0.62)
(Figures S7D and S7E). In accordance with Big2 mouse tumors,
patients from group D presented with bigger tumors at the time
of biopsy (Figure 6E). Furthermore, neutrophil infiltration and
CD31 staining were negatively correlated (Figure 6F). We also
confirmed that Snail expression is associated with an adverse
outcome (p = 0.05, HR = 1.83) (Figure 6G), as reported previously
(Hung et al., 2009; Yanagawa et al., 2009). Groups of patients
showing higher infiltration of neutrophils also displayed increased
proportion of Snail-positive tumors (Figure S7F). In The Cancer
Genome Atlas, SNAIL was positively correlated with the expres-
sion of each of CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL5, and CXCL8 mRNA in lung
adenocarcinoma patients (Figure S7G). In conclusion, transla-
tion of our findings from the KP mouse model to human lung
adenocarcinoma uncovers a group comprising about one third
of lung adenocarcinoma patients displaying larger tumors with
a high neutrophil infiltration and a poor prognosis.
DISCUSSION
Similarly to NSCLC patients (Dieu-Nosjean et al., 2014), well-
organized TLS-like structures are formed in the lung of tumor-
bearing mice (Joshi et al., 2015). To interrogate the contribution
of the immune compartment in this disease, we have developed
a powerful algorithm, MegaClust, allowing us to generate an im-
mune signature of lung tumors. Neutrophils are most abundant in

 a subgroup of large and hence advanced tumors. By integrating
patient samples, we could confirm that neutrophils have a strong
association with disease progression, consistent with a previous
report (Peng et al., 2015). Although neutrophils participate in
breast cancer metastasis to the lung (Coffelt et al., 2015; Wculek
and Malanchi, 2015), their role in the biology of primary lung tu-
mors remains obscure.
Our work revealed technical difficulties inherent to the func-
tional characterization of neutrophils in vivo. We compared the
efficacy of two commonly used antibodies, anti-Ly6G and anti-
Gr1, to specifically deplete these cells and observed that neither
of them yielded satisfactory results. Only anti-Gr1 resulted in a
good depletion of neutrophils but was accompanied by off-
target effects on monocytes. However, the monocyte infiltration
in KP tumors is intrinsically very low, and CD11b+ cell infiltration
in tumors was not reduced by anti-Gr1. Nevertheless, there is a
need to develop better tools to further understand the function-
ality of these cells in cancer.
Our results demonstrate that neutrophil infiltration orches-
trates the immune exclusion in KP tumors, leading to failure of
immunotherapy. Considering that KP tumors present a very
small number of secondary mutations, one could hypothesize
that immunotherapy success is prevented by the lack of tumor
antigens to target (Westcott et al., 2015). We show here that tu-
mors grow faster in a Rag1ko background, suggesting a partial
control of the lesions by adaptive immunity. Furthermore, it has
been reported that even the immunogenic variant of this model,
generated by introducing strong antigens (luciferase or oval-
bumin), remains insensitive to anti-PD1 (Pfirschke et al., 2016).
Whereas old paradigms stipulated that tumors can be either de-
tected or ignored by the immune system, more recent observa-
tions have proposed the existence of a third group of lesions in
which the immune cells are excluded from the tumor mass,
rendering them resistant to immune checkpoint blockade (Joyce
and Fearon, 2015; Topalian et al., 2016). Consistently, we
observed that Gr1+ cell depletion modified blood vessels by
enhancing their spreading and coverage by pericytes, in line
with a previous study in a pancreatic cancer model (Incio et al.,
2016). Furthermore, in absence of neutrophils, endothelial cells
acquire a HEV-like phenotype that could participate in immune
cell extravasation into the tumor mass (Sata and Walsh, 1998).
This could explain the reversal of the immune exclusion due to
a mutual regulation between blood vessel normalization and im-
mune reprograming (Tian et al., 2017).
Our results, however, suggest that the immune exclusion only
partially explains the tumor-promoting effect of neutrophils, as
even in the absence of adaptive immunity, neutrophils promote
tumor growth. Through its action on blood vessels, neutrophil
infiltration increases tumor hypoxia. Our in vitro experiments
demonstrated that hypoxia, via HIF-1a, stabilizes Snail expres-
sion in tumor cells. Accordingly, Gr1+ cell depletion led to a
reduction of both hypoxia and Snail expression in KP tumors.
This observation goes in line with a previous report showing
that expression of a non-degradable mutant form of HIF-2a in
Kras-driven lung tumors stabilizes Snail expression (Kim et al.,
2009). We functionally demonstrated that enhanced Snail accel-
erates lung cancer progression, which is consistent with its
negative prognostic value in lung cancer (Hung et al., 2009; Ya-
nagawa et al., 2009). This indicates that in addition to the im-
mune exclusion and blood vessel remodeling, neutrophils favor
disease progression by stabilizing Snail.
Previous reports have established a role for Snail in supporting
tumor development and progression via cytokine production
and the recruitment of specific immune cell populations, ulti-
mately promoting a pro-tumorigenic immune microenvironment
in various contexts (Hsu et al., 2014; Kudo-Saito et al., 2009). Our
results indicate that Snail activity in lung tumor cells enhances
neutrophil recruitment into the tumor mass. Snail-expressing tu-
mor cells release a soluble factor that enhances the secretion of
Cxcl2 in the tumor microenvironment, thereby establishing a
positive feedback loop of Snail-mediated neutrophil recruitment.
Although this probably involves multiple mechanisms, Cxcr2, the

 receptor for Cxcl1, Cxcl2, and Cxcl5, has been shown to partic-
ipate in neutrophil recruitment in pancreatic tumors (Steele et al.,
2016). As exemplified by Cxcl2 expression by tumor neutrophils,
Snail-expressing cancer cells could release chemokines and cy-
tokines that modify neutrophil behavior. Identifying the soluble
factor(s) leading to exacerbated Cxcl2 expression by neutrophils
in tumors is a potential important perspective that could open for
new therapeutic approaches.
Given that we have also observed a tumor growth-promoting
effect of Snail in immunodeficient Rag1ko mice and that neutrophil
depletion did not affect tumor growth kinetics of Snail-overex-
pressing tumors, Snail probably exerts additional tumor-promot-
ing functions beyond its role in modulating the tumor immune
compartment. The detrimental role of Snail in cancer classically
includes the facilitation of metastatic progression of tumors via
EMT (Thiery et al., 2009). We did indeed detect a reduced mem-
brane E-cadherin localization in regions of strong Snail expression
and a concomitant increase in some mesenchymal markers,
consistent with a partial EMT phenotype (Nieto et al., 2016).
In conclusion, we demonstrate the clinical relevance of draw-
ing an unsupervised immune signature from murine tumor sam-
ples, as this enabled us to characterize a mechanism of immune
exclusion and disease progression driven by neutrophils. We
are hence proposing a deleterious dialogue among neutrophils,
blood vessels, and cancer cells, culminating in the stabilization
of Snail in tumor cells and the establishment of a tumor microen-
vironment favoring disease progression.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
All reagents (Ab, oligonucleotides), lentiviral vector construction and produc-
tion, flow cytometry staining, MegaClust processing, and details on immuno-
staining are given in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Mouse Models
K-rasLSL-G12D/WT and p53FL/FL mice in a C57BL6/J background were bred to
obtain K-rasLSL-G12D/WT; p53FL/FL (KP) mice. KP mice were bred with CCSP-
rtTA (R) mice in the same background to generate KPR mice. KPR mice
were bred with Rag1�/� animals to generate immunodeficient KPR mice. K,
P, and R mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. All mouse exper-
iments were performed with the permission of the Veterinary Authority of
Canton de Vaud, Switzerland (license number VD2391). All experimental
design, animal housing conditions, animal number, and treatment modalities
were previously approved by Re
´ seau des Animaleries Le
´ maniques (RESAL)
competent ethics committee.
Mouse Treatment Modalities
The tumors were initiated upon infection of lung epithelial cells with a viral vec-
tor delivering Cre recombinase to activate oncogenic KrasG12D and delete p53
(Jackson et al., 2005). Twelve- to fourteen-week-old mice were infected intra-
tracheally with 1,500 Cre-active lentiviral units. Neutrophil depletion was per-
formed at 25 weeks post-tumor initiation (WPI) using anti-Ly6G or anti-Gr1 ab
(10 mg/kg) three times per week. Neutrophil depletion was validated during the
experiment by tail vain blood sampling at day 12, followed by flow cytometry
analyses of CD11b+Ly6C+CD11c�Ly6G+ circulating cells. Control mice were
injected with IgG ab at the same dose (Jackson Immunoresearch). For the pi-
monidazole treatment, mice received 50 mL/10 g of 12 mg/mL pimonidazole
solution intraperitoneally (i.p.) 1 hr before sacrifice. For Snail induction, the
mice were fed a diet containing 0.625 g/kg doxycycline (Provimi Kliba) from
the day of tumor initiation until the day of sacrifice.
To measure tumor volume, mice were anaesthetized using isoflurane and
maintained under anesthesia during the scanning procedure. Lungs were
imaged with mCT (Quantum FX; PerkinElmer) at a 50 mm voxel size, with retro-
spective respiratory gating. Individual tumor volumes were measured and
calculated using Analyze (PerkinElmer).
Chemokine Measurements
Tumors were mechanically dissociated in 200 mL DMEM per 50 mg tissue.
Supernatant was generated by centrifugation, filtered, and stored at �80�C.
Chemokine quantification was done using the LEGENDPlex proinflammatory
chemokine multiplex assay (740451; Biolegend) according to the provider’s in-
structions and analyzed using the dedicated software provided by Biolegend.
Data acquisition was performed on a LSRII SORP flow cytometer with HTS
module. For Cxcl2, we used the mouse Quantikine ELISA kit (MM200).
TCGA Data Processing
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) dataset was
retrieved from http://cancergenome.nih.gov. Samples with clinical information
and mRNA (RNASEQV2) expression data were selected (448 samples), and
the data were downloaded using the RTCGA package (Samur, 2014). Normal-
ized RSEM gene counts as provided by TCGA were taken. As a filtering step,
only genes with counts per million >1 in at least 50 samples were kept for
further analysis, and counts were converted to log-counts per million using
the voom function from the limma package (Ritchie et al., 2015).
Mouse mRNA Sequencing, Differential Expression, and Pathway
Analyses
Multiplexed libraries for mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) were prepared with
the TruSeq stranded mRNA kit (Illumina) starting from 500 ng of good-quality
total RNAs (RNA quality scores >7 on the Fragment Analyzer). Sequencing
was subsequently performed on a NextSeq 500 instrument (Illumina) on a
high-output flow cell, yielding single-end reads of 85 nucleotides. Adaptor
sequences and low-quality ends were removed with cutadapt version 1.4.2,
trimming for TrueSeq and polyA sequences. Reads were aligned to mouse
genome build mm10 using STAR aligner.
Differential expression between neutrophilhigh (NH) and neutrophillow (NL)
samples (determined by flow cytometry) was computed with DEseq2, after
filtering genes with average counts < 5. Gene set enrichment analysis was per-
formed on the ranked list of genes with Biocarta genesets.
Statistics
For all mouse experiments, we used a minimum of four mice per condition, and
n refers to the number of tumors analyzed. All results are represented as mean
± SEM if not stated otherwise. Comparisons between groups were made as
stated in the figure legends. Statistical significance is indicated as *p < 0.05,
**p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001, or ns (not significant), using Mann-Whit-
ney tests because of small group size, where not indicated otherwise. Statis-
tical analysis was performed using Prism 6 software.
For human data, all statistical analyses were performed using the free high-
level interpreted statistical language R (version 3.2.2) and various Bio-
conductor packages (http://www.bioconductor.org).
