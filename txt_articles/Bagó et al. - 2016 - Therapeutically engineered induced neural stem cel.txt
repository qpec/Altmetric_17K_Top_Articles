Transdifferentiation (TD) is a recent advancement in somatic cell reprogramming. The direct
conversion of TD eliminates the pluripotent intermediate state to create cells that are ideal
for personalized cell therapy. Here we provide evidence that TD-derived induced neural stem
cells (iNSCs) are an efficacious therapeutic strategy for brain cancer. We find that iNSCs
genetically engineered with optical reporters and tumouricidal gene products retain the
capacity to differentiate and induced apoptosis in co-cultured human glioblastoma cells.
Time-lapse imaging shows that iNSCs are tumouritropic, homing rapidly to co-cultured
glioblastoma cells and migrating extensively to distant tumour foci in the murine brain.
Multimodality imaging reveals that iNSC delivery of the anticancer molecule TRAIL decreases
the growth of established solid and diffuse patient-derived orthotopic glioblastoma xenografts
230- and 20-fold, respectively, while significantly prolonging the median mouse survival.
These findings establish a strategy for creating autologous cell-based therapies to treat
patients with aggressive forms of brain cancer.

ver since Yamanaka published his groundbreaking studies
on induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)1,2, cellular
reprogramming has opened new avenues for potential
transplantation therapies3. However, reports that iPSCs form
cancerous teratomas when implanted in vivo have limited the
application of iPSC and iPSC-derived cell transplant therapies.
With the recent development of transdifferentiation (TD),
where somatic cells are directly reprogrammed into an alternate
lineage bypassing dedifferentiation into a pluripotent state,
reprogramming technology now stands poised to achieve safe
personalized cell transplant therapy4. The newest addition to the
cell types created by TD is neural stem cells (NSCs), called
induced NSCs (iNSCs)5–8. iNSCs were first reported by Kim
et al.5, followed closely by several studies using different TD
strategies6,7,9. In these studies, iNSCs were found to express
nestin
and
differentiate
into
astrocytes,
neurons
and
oligodendrocytes similar to brain-derived NSCs. Yet, unlike
NSCs derived from embryonic stem cells or iPSCs, iNSCs showed
no cancerous teratoma formation in vivo7,10. This suggests
that iNSCs can provide safe, routine, patient-specific cell
transplantation therapy to treat disorders of the central nervous
system (CNS). However, the efficacy of iNSC-based therapy
remains to be defined.
Cancers of the CNS are devastating diseases. Each year,
14,000 patients are diagnosed with glioblastoma (GBM), the most
common primary brain cancer11. Despite multimodal treatment,
the median life expectancy for GBM patients is only 15–17
months, and fewer than 10% will survive beyond 5 years (ref. 12).
NSC delivery of
therapeutic molecules
is
emerging as a
promising approach to achieve effective killing of cancers
where conventional treatments fail13–18. NSCs display unique
tumouritropic migration that allows them unprecedented access
to solid and invasive cancer cells18. In addition, when stably
engineered
to
release
anticancer
molecules,
NSCs
provide
long-term drug delivery directly to cancerous deposits. This
exceptional tropism towards areas of pathology and highly
selective drug delivery directly into tumours has allowed
tumouricidal NSC therapies to exhibit potent anticancer efficacy
in a variety of preclinical models13–16. Despite these successes,
procurement of appropriate cells for routine clinical use remains
one of the greatest challenges to tumouricidal NSC therapy. The
ideal cell carrier would be autologous and readily available;
however, NSCs reside deep within the adult brain in limited
quantities19. The properties of iNSCs make them an attractive
source to derive personalized cellular vehicles for cancer therapy.
In addition to their unique ability for safe patient-specific
generation, iNSCs display the key attributes of effective cell
carrier systems: high expression of engineered transgenes, long-
term survival in vivo and absence of tumour formation4,5,7,8. This
suggests that a new class of autologous NSC-based cancer
therapies could be created by transdifferentiating skin fibroblasts
into iNSCs that could be expanded, engineered and re-implanted
into patients.
In this study, we provide the first insights into iNSC-based
therapy
by
developing
and
testing
the
first
iNSC-based
drug-delivery vehicles. Using a combination of molecular assays,
non-invasive serial imaging and human GBM xenografts, we were
able to define (i) the survival and fate of these cells in vivo, (ii) the
tumouritropic migration of this novel drug carrier and (iii) the
efficacy of iNSC-based tumouricidal therapy against solid and
diffuse brain cancer in preclinical models.
Results
Engineered
iNSCs
differentiate
and
proliferate.
To
first
generate iNSCs, we followed the method of Lujan et al. and
transduced fibroblasts with lentiviral vectors (LV) encoding the
transcription factors Brn2, Sox2 and FoxG1 (ref. 6; Fig. 1a). To
permit the exploration of iNSC carrier fate, migration and
anticancer efficacy, we next created a panel of iNSC cell carriers
by using LVs to genetically engineer cells with optical reporters
and therapeutic transgenes (Fig. 1a). We first evaluated whether
general stem cell properties would be affected by LV modification.
iNSCs cultured in a monolayer were transduced with LV
encoding a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-luciferase fusion
protein (iNSC-GFPFL). Forty-eight hours post transduction,
robust GFP expression was observed in the cells (Fig. 1b). When
iNSC-GFPFLs were placed in non-adherent flasks, the cells
rapidly formed GFP þ neurospheres (Fig. 1c). Comparison of cell
viability revealed minimal differences in the growth rate between
iNSC-GFPFL and unmodified iNSCs through 10 days (2.6- versus
2.5-fold on day 10; Fig. 1d), and both cell lines were able to be
extensively passaged in culture (Fig. 1e). As shown in Fig. 1f,
iNSC-GFPFL robustly expressed the NSC markers nestin and
Sox2. When induced to differentiate, iNSC-GFPFL formed
GFAP þ astrocytes and Tuj-1 þ neurons while simultaneously
decreasing the expression of nestin. The generation of astrocytes
and neurons by iNSC-GFPFL was as efficient as unmodified
iNSCs (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Fig. 1). We next performed
cytogenetic analysis on G-banded metaphase spreads from the
iNSC-GFPFL. The analysis showed that the modified iNSCs
exhibited a normal female karyotype (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Lastly, a linear correlation between iNSC-GFPFL cell number and
luciferase signal was observed in vitro (Fig. 1h).
We next utilized the engineered iNSCs to investigate the fate of
these cells in the context of GBM. iNSCs have been reported to
persist in the brain through 10 weeks post implantation6. We
implanted iNSC-GFPFL into the parenchyma of mice in the
presence and absence of GBMs. Using real-time non-invasive
imaging to monitor the survival of engineered iNSCs, we found
that iNSC levels did not statistically change through 4 weeks
(Fig. 2a). Post-mortem immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed
that the majority of iNSC-GFPFL expressed the NSC marker
nestin 2 weeks post implantation (Fig. 2b). We observed few
iNSC-GFPFL cells expressing the astrocyte marker glial fibrillary
acidic protein (GFAP) or the neuronal marker Tuj-1. Serial
imaging also revealed that iNSC survival was not altered by
implantation into the brains of mice bearing GBM (Fig. 2c).
Using fluorescence imaging of tissue sections, we found that
GFP þ iNSCs were still present in the mCherry þ GBM 28 days
after implantation (Fig. 2d). Together, these results suggest that
iNSCs can be genetically modified with minimal impact on their
capacity to proliferate or differentiate, and that the modified cells
survive at least 1 month in the brain of mice.
iNSCs migrate selectively to GBM. The ability to home to solid
and invasive GBM deposits is one of the most beneficial char-
acteristics of NSC-based cancer therapies16,20. To investigate the
tumouritropic nature of iNSCs, we used real-time fluorescent
motion analysis of iNSC and GBM co-cultures with the migration
of wild-type NSCs (WTNSC) as a reference (outlined in Fig. 3a).
We
found
that
iNSC-GFPFL
rapidly
migrated
towards
mCherry þ GBM cells over 24 h, covering the 500-mm gap in
B28 h (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Movies 1–3). Single-cell
tracking analysis (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Movie 2) showed
that the total migratory distance of iNSCs was similar to WTNSC
(Fig. 3d). We next analysed the directionality of movement by
determining the ratio of Euclidean distance to the accumulated
distance. Straight motion was given a value of 1 and non-straight
motion a value of 0. We found that iNSC migration towards
co-cultured GBM cells had the same directionality as WTNSC
(Fig. 3e; Supplementary Movies 1 and 3). Lastly, we evaluated the

 capacity of iNSCs to home to patient-derived GBM cells in
culture. Motion analysis showed that iNSCs seeded 500 mm from
patient-derived GBM8 tumour cells migrated to the cultured
tumour cells colocalizing within 36 h (Fig. 3f and Supplementary
Movie 4). These results suggest that iNSCs have tumouritropic
potential.
To next determine whether iNSC migration is specific for GBM
cells, we designed a bi-directional under-agarose migration
system to create multiple chemotactic gradients (detailed in
Fig. 3g). Three wells were created in agarose 500 mm apart.
GFP þ iNSCs were seeded in the middle well. To create a
chemical gradient for GBM cells in one direction and fibroblasts
in the opposite direction, mCherry þ GBM cells were seeded in
one lateral well and BFP þ fibroblasts in the other lateral well.
Real-time kinetic imaging was used to simultaneously monitor
iNSC migration towards both GBM cell and fibroblasts. We
found
that iNSCs
migrated
selectively
towards
the GBM
chemotactic signal (Fig. 3h,i). iNSC had migrated into the
iNSC:GBM agarose 3 days post seeding, and the number of iNSCs
as well as the migratory distance increased on day 5. In contrast,
minimal iNSC migration was detected towards the fibroblast-
containing wells. These findings suggest that iNSCs selectively
migrate towards GBM cells.
To investigate iNSC migration to GBM in vivo, we first
examined the ability of iNSCs to track GBM cells invading the
parenchyma.

were implanted at the same site as the GBM8 tumours. After 3
weeks, mice were killed and IHC was performed to determine the
distribution of both GBM8 cells and iNSCs by capturing images
1.5 mm from the implantation site (summarized in Fig. 4a). We
detected numerous GFP þ iNSCs colocalizing with the diffuse
GBM cells as they invaded the normal brain (Fig. 4b). In addition,
the iNSCs showed an elongated morphology indicative of
migrating cells (Fig. 4c).

 Next, we investigated the capacity of iNSCs to migrate to
distant established GBMs. mCherry þ
U87 tumours were
implanted in mice. Five days later, iNSC-GFPFLs were implanted
in the contralateral hemisphere (summarized in Fig. 4d).
Immunofluorescent images of tissue sections taken 21 days post
implantation showed that iNSCs colocalized with the GBM
(Fig. 4e,f). Together, these observations support the conclusion
that iNSCs possess tumouritropic properties and home to GBM
cells in vitro and in vivo.
Tumouricidal iNSCs are an efficacious therapy for GBM.
To investigate the therapeutic efficacy of iNSC-based GBM
treatment, we engineered iNSCs to express a secreted variant of
the pro-apoptotic molecule tumour necrosis factor-a-related
apoptosis-inducing
ligand
(TRAIL;
iNSC-sTR).
We
have
previously established the anti-GBM effects of TRAIL when
delivered from engineered cell carriers14,22–24, making this the
ideal tumouricidal molecule to characterize iNSC delivery
vehicles. Robust expression of the GFP reporter was detected
following transduction of the iNSCs (Supplementary Fig. 4a,b),
and
the
modified
cells
could
be
maintained
through
multiple
passages
(Supplementary
Fig.
4c).
Western
blot
analysis confirmed that iNSCs expressed the TRAIL protein
(Supplementary Fig. 4d), while quantification of TRAIL levels in
the culture media showed 252 ng per 106 cells over 24 h
(Supplementary Fig. 4e). Immunocytochemistry showed that
iNSC-sTR expressed high levels of the NSC marker nestin
(Fig. 5a), while differentiation of iNSC-sTR generated GFAP þ
astrocytes, Tuj-1 þ
neurons and reduced nestin expression
(Fig. 5a). In addition, iNSC-sTR proliferated at rates similar to
those observed for iNSC-GFPFL (Fig. 5b). These results suggest
that modification of iNSCs with TRAIL does not interfere with
their properties as stem cells.
Efficient release of tumouricidal gene products is critical to the
anticancer effects of cell-based drug carriers15. To investigate the
release of cytotoxic agents from iNSCs, we engineered iNSCs with
an imageable fusion between Gaussia luciferase and TRAIL
(iNSC-diTR) that we have previously used to characterize
differences in TRAIL secretion between different stem cell
lines15.
Western
blot
analysis
confirmed
that
the
iNSCs
expressed the diagnostic TRAIL (diTR) protein (Supplementary
Fig. 4f). Bioluminescence imaging on media samples showed that
diTR was stably released from iNSCs and levels increased with
time as diTR accumulated in the culture media over 10 days
(Fig. 5c). Importantly, the levels of diTR released by iNSCs was
similar to those released by WTNSC that are proven to effectively
eradicate GBM14–16,18.
To evaluate the anti-GBM efficacy of cytotoxic iNSCs,
iNSC-sTRs or control iNSC-GFPs were co-cultured with human
U87 or LN18 GBM cells expressing mCherry and firefly luciferase
(mC-FL; Fig. 5d). Luciferase assays and fluorescence imaging
revealed that iNSC-sTR decreased the viability of U87 and LN18
human GBM cells to 93% and 87%, respectively (Fig. 5e). It is well

 established that TRAIL-induced cell death occurs via caspase-
mediated apoptosis25, and treatment of U87 and LN18 GBM lines
with conditioned media from iNSC-sTR treatment significantly
upregulated caspase-3/7 activity over time (Fig. 5f). We detected a
decline in caspase activity in LN18 cells at 16 h that was likely due
to an extensive cell loss at this time point caused by robust
TRAIL-induced cell death. Next, we cultured U87, LN18 and
GBM8 cells with increasing numbers of iNSC-sTR to determine
the ratio of iNSC-sTRs:GBMs that induced tumour cell death.
Using cell viability assays, we detected statistically significant
reductions in tumour viability at ratios as low as 0.2:1, and GBM
cell death increased with increasing numbers of iNSC-sTR
(Fig. 5g,h).
To test the in vivo efficacy of iNSC-based therapy, we first
determined the effects of iNSC-sTR treatment on solitary human
GBMs.

cells

were
implanted intracranially with iNSC-sTR or control iNSC-GFP,
and tumour volumes were followed using serial bioluminescence
imaging. We found that iNSC-sTR treatment induced a marked
reduction in tumour growth and decreased GBM volumes
123-fold by day 28 (Fig. 6a). In addition, iNSC-sTR-treated
animals survived more than 2 months before succumbing to
recurrent tumours (median survival: 62 days; Supplementary
Fig. 5), while control animal succumbed to GBM growth in
only 28 days (Fig. 6b). To verify the changes in GBM volumes
detected by bioluminescence imaging, fluorescence imaging
of post-mortem brain sections collected from control and
iNSC-sTR-treated animals 21 days after treatment confirmed
the presence of large mCherry þ GBM in the control-treated
animals that encompassed the majority of the hemisphere where
the cells were implanted (Fig. 6c). In contrast, a small GBM was
detected in the iNSC-sTR-treated animals near the initial site
of implantation. In these tissue sections, GFP þ iNSC-GFP
and iNSC-sTR were distributed around both the control and
sTR-treated tumours 21 days post injection.
Next, we investigated whether the cytotoxic effect of iNSC-sTR
was specific to cancer cells. Cultured iNSCs, neurons, astrocytes

 iNSC-sTR or iNSC-GFP. Cell viability assays performed 48 h later
showed that viability was not reduced in iNSCs, neurons or
astrocytes treated with iNSC-sTR media, although GBM viability
was still significantly reduced by the same conditioned media
(Fig. 6d). To investigate iNSC-sTR toxicity in vivo, we implanted
iNSC-sTR into the brain of non-tumour-bearing Nude mice.
Pathologic analysis of tissue sections 2 weeks after implantation
showed no overt signs of toxicity in the brain. Neural content and
cell morphology were similar at sites 0.5 mm from the site of
iNSC-sTR injection and the same distance from the midline in
the contralateral hemisphere (Fig. 6e).
To determine the efficacy of iNSC-sTR treatment on patient-
derived human GBM cells, we co-cultured GBM8 cells expressing
mC-FL (GBM8-mC-FL) with iNSC-sTR or control iNSC-GFP.
Cell viability assays showed that iNSC-sTR decreased GBM8
viability that was accompanied by a parallel increase in caspase
activation (Fig. 7a–c). The patient-derived GBM8 cells are highly
invasive and form diffuse tumours in vivo21. We used this model
to define the efficacy of iNSC-sTR therapy on established
diffuse GBMs by implanting GBM8-mC-FL cells into the
mouse brain parenchyma. Three days later, iNSC-sTR or
control cells were administered directly into the established
tumours. Serial bioluminescence imaging showed that iNSC-sTR
treatment attenuated the progression of GBM8 tumours, reducing
tumour burden by 18.3-fold compared with control 33 days after
treatment (Fig. 7d,e). These imaging results were confirmed
by post-mortem IHC that showed a small GBM present after
iNSC-sTR therapy compared with control treatment (Fig. 7f).
iNSC-sTR therapy also led to a significant extension in survival
as iNSC-sTR-treated animals survived an average of 59 days
compared with only 37 days in control-treated mice (Fig. 7g),
yet the animals succumbed to eventual tumour recurrence
(Supplementary Fig. 3i). Together, these results show that
iNSC-sTR therapy has significant therapeutic effects against
malignant and invasive GBM, and markedly prolongs the survival
of tumour-bearing mice.
GBM is a heterogeneous tumour type, and response to therapy
can vary. As such, we further validated the efficacy of iNSC-sTR
therapy against additional patient-derived GBM cell lines. Three
different human patient-derived GBM cell lines were cultured
with increasing numbers of iNSC-sTR. Cell viability assays
performed 24 h post treatment revealed that iNSC-sTR reduced
the viability of all three GBM lines, although the response varied
(Fig. 8a). The 7030 line showed the greatest sensitivity to TRAIL,
7081 showed the greatest resistance, while the 7063 showed
intermediate sensitivity, with significant cell death occurring at an
iNSC-sTR:GBM ratio as low as 0.2:1. To investigate the iNSC-sTR
therapy
against
additional
patient-derived
GBMs
in
vivo,
CD133 þ 7063 GBM cells expressing mCherry and FLuc were
xenografted into mice (Supplementary Fig. 6). Seven days later,
iNSC-sTRs or iNSC-GFPs were implanted into the established
tumours. Serial bioluminescence imaging showed that iNSC-sTR
treatment
significantly
inhibited
the growth
of the
GBM
compared with control-treated animals (Fig. 8b). Analysis of
post-mortem tissue sections confirmed the reduction in tumour
volumes by iNSC-sTR treatment (Fig. 8c) and a reduction in the
number of proliferating tumour cells (Fig. 8d). These results
support the conclusion that iNSC-sTR treatment has efficacious
effects against patient-derived GBMs.
Discussion
In this study we investigated the use of iNSCs as cellular delivery
vehicles for GBM therapy. We show that iNSCs can be engineered
with therapeutic or diagnostic transgenes without affecting their
ability to proliferate or differentiate. We found that iNSCs rapidly

 migrate to GBM cells in culture and home to human GBM
xenografts in vivo. We also observed that iNSCs stably secrete the
anticancer protein TRAIL and kill human GBM cells in culture.
In vivo, iNSC-sTR therapy markedly suppressed tumour growth
and significantly extended the survival of mice bearing malignant
or invasive human GBM xenografts. Together, these data support
the potential of iNSCs to serve as highly effective drug-delivery
vehicles for treatment of solid and invasive brain tumours.
Cellular
reprogramming
is
an
exciting
technology
that
has offered new opportunities for developing large numbers of
personalized stem cells3. iNSC technology represents a promising
alternative to iPSCs and creates cells that are ideal for transplant.
To date, iNSCs have been generated through two main methods:
transient
expression
of
reprogramming
factors
or
forced
expression of NSC-specific transcription factors. In both cases,
the resulting iNSCs gave rise to astrocytes, neurons and
oligodendrocytes. In addition, three studies have confirmed the
lack of tumorigenesis following iNSC implantation in vivo6–8,10.
These data clearly suggest the beneficial properties of iNSCs for
therapy; yet, no studies have explored the efficacy of iNSC-based
treatment for diseases of the CNS. While iNSCs will undoubtedly
be explored for treatment of neurological disorders, iNSCs
could potentially benefit human health through application
in other fields that include the development of more efficient
drug-delivery vehicles. Cancers of the CNS are a devastating
disease11, and iNSC technology could fill the critical need for
autologous drug carriers. The in vitro and in vivo findings in this
study demonstrate the feasibility of iNSC-based therapy for
GBM and form a foundation to justify continued development of
iNSC-based treatments.
We investigated the effects of engineering iNSCS with LVs
encoding optical reporters and anticancer therapeutic transgenes
on cell fate. We previously demonstrated the ability to engineer
human and mouse mesenchymal and NSCs to allow in vivo

 tracking as well as GBM killing13–15,24. We found that iNSCs
engineered with GFPFL or TRAIL proliferated and differentiated
with the same efficiency as unmodified cells. In addition, the
modified iNSCs stably secreted the pro-apoptotic TRAIL at levels
that were equivalent to WTNSC. Therefore, it is likely that iNSCs
will stably release a variety of antitumour transgenes similar
to WTNSC (ref. 26). This would allow a broad application of
iNSC-based cancer therapy through creation of a panel of
therapeutic iNSCs to target tumour cells regardless of the
underlying genetic drivers or molecular profile. It could also
allow therapeutic iNSCs to be engineered with clinically relevant
imaging molecules, such as PET-compatible cytosine deaminase
or thymidine kinase, to track the fate of cells once they enter
patient trials.
We found that iNSCs possess the same unique tumour-homing
capacity as WTNSC. Unlike traditional Boyden chamber assays,
we used real-time fluorescence motion analysis to generate
time-lapse movies and quantified the migratory velocity, distance
and directionality of both iNSC and WTNSC to co-cultured
human GBM cells. We discovered that iNSCs home selectively to
GBM cells at a velocity and directionality equivalent to WTNSC.
In vivo, we found that iNSCs colocalized with diffuse GBM cells
1.5 mm from the primary tumour site 3 weeks after implantation
and colocalize with solid GBMs implanted in the contralateral
hemisphere of mice. The tumour-homing properties are one of
the most important features of NSC-based GBM therapy. WTNSC
are known to migrate through the brain to both solid and diffuse
GBM cells with greater speed than mesenchymal stem cell
carriers27. GBM therapy is more effective when delivered from
migratory NSCs than non-migratory fibroblasts20. Extensive
studies have uncovered the molecular mechanisms mediating
WTNSC homing to GBM cells (summarized in refs 28,29).
WTNSC tumouritropic homing is known to occur by chemotaxis
and several key signalling pathways have been identified, such as

 the CXCR4/SDF-1 signalling axis29–34. These key pathways are
upregulated in WTNSC but not on normal cells (that is, fibroblasts
and astrocytes). Thus, fibroblasts do not have the same tumour-
homing capacity that NSCs possess. We demonstrate for the first
time that iNSCs have the same tumour-homing capacity as brain-
derived NSCs. This suggests that these tumour-homing pathways
are upregulated as fibroblasts are converted into iNSCs. This adds
tumouritropic signalling pathways to the list of features both
iNSCs and brain-derived NSC share, but fibroblasts do not. Other
features shared by both iNSCs and NSCs (but not fibroblasts)
include nestin expression, Pax6 expression, the ability to
differentiate into astrocytes, neurons and oligodendrocytes,
and so on4,35. We are exploring the expression of multiple
chemotactic pathways by iNSC cells, using short interfering
RNA-mediated
knockdown
to
investigate
the
relative
contribution of each pathway in in vitro and in vivo model
systems, and performing side-by-side comparison with brain-
derived NSCs. Future studies will be required to determine
whether iNSCs are able to migrate to areas of stroke or other
brain lesion similar to WTNSC.
We found that iNSC-sTR inhibited the growth of malignant
and patient-derived xenografts, as well as increased the survival
of tumour-bearing mice. The effects on tumour progression
and survival were greater in the U87 model than in the GBM8
model. We have previously observed similar findings using
WTNSC-based delivery of TRAIL13,15,23. This is likely due to the
invasive nature of the GBM8 cells that, similar to diffuse GBM in
patients, allows them to evade treatment. In addition, we found
that animals eventually succumbed to GBM recurrence despite
the initial reductions in tumour volumes. This suggests that
multiple rounds of iNSC-sTR therapy may be required to
eradicate
the
tumours
or
sustain
GBM
suppression.

previously demonstrated that combination strategies improve
TRAIL killing and overcome resistant tumour populations13,14,

 The potential for autologous NSC-based therapy is one of the
key benefits to iNSC cell carriers. Testing autologous iNSC-based
therapies for GBM in mice could be accomplished but would
require a syngeneic mouse model. Few studies have explored the
efficacy of NSC-based therapy using mouse-derived GBMs in
C57BL/6 mice. This is due in part to the lack of clinically relevant
models36. We performed these initial proof-of-concept studies
using human xenograft models in immune-deficient mice.
Although this does not uncover the benefits of autologous
transplant, our findings clearly demonstrate that iNSC-based
therapy has a significant impact on the growth of human GBM
xenografts. These feasibility studies can now be followed with
more extensive investigation where iNSC carriers are created and
used for truly autologous therapy in mouse models of murine-
derived orthotopic allograft. We envision an eventual clinical
approach where skin biopsies from GBM patients could be
rapidly converted to iNSCs that are engineered with antitumour
therapies and re-implanted into the patient for autologous
cell-based GBM therapy.
Although our results are promising, there are limitations. One
of the greatest limitations to transplant therapy with stem cells
created by cellular reprogramming technology has been the use of
viral vectors. As such, a variety of studies have demonstrated the
potential for generating iPSCs through non-viral methods37,
and small molecules or RNA-based methods are particularly
attractive. Recently, Adler et al. used a nanoparticle-based
approach
to
successfully
convert
fibroblasts
directly
into
neurons38. In addition, advancement towards clinical iNSC-
based carriers will require the development of human iNSC
(h-iNSC) cell carriers. In a subset of experiments, Ring et al.
showed that their approach of Sox2 transduction and culturing
on feeder cells could convert human fibroblasts into h-iNSCs
that generated astrocytes, neurons and oligodendrocytes in vitro
and did not form tumours in vivo. Matsui et al. reported that
generation of h-iNSCs could also be accomplished by partial
reprogramming of cells using Yamanaka factors. The continued
development and characterization of h-iNSC cells will pave the
way for future investigations into the efficacy of h-iNSC therapies
for CNS disorders. Once cytotoxic h-iNSCs are generated, they
will need to be tested against the HB1.F3.CD cell line. This
human NSC is an established line that has brought the field of
NSC-based therapy for GBM into human patient testing. The
line has been extensively characterized to gain approval for first-
in-human testing17,18. Yet, one potential limitation of this cell
lines is that it requires allogeneic transplant. In contrast, the
autologous h-iNSC approach has the potential to avoid immune
rejection, increase carrier persistence and improve therapeutic
efficacy. Side-by-side comparisons between HB1.F3.CD and
cytotoxic h-iNSCs will be critical to reveal differences in
migratory rate, safety, drug release and tumour killing. The
benefits of autologous versus allogeneic therapy will require large
animal testing, and may not be fully revealed until human testing
is approved.
In summary, our results provide the first evidence that iNSC
can treat diseases of the CNS and demonstrate the feasibility and
efficacy of iNSC-based therapy for GBM. We found that iNSCs
migrate to GBM, secrete anticancer molecules and regress GBM
with the same efficiency as WTNSC drug carriers. Stem cell-based
therapy
for
GBM
has
recently
entered
clinical trials
for
primary and recurrent GBM, and trials for breast cancer
and neuroblastoma will be launched soon. With continued
development, iNSC technology will have an impact on the design
of these trials as a viable alternative drug-delivery vehicle with the
potential for autologous treatment.

 California, San Francisco Cancer Center). 293T/17 cells were purchased from the
UNC Tissue Culture Facility. All lines were grown as previously described15,39,40,
authenticated and tested for mycoplasma. Reprogramming LVs were purchased
from Addgene: TetO-FUW-Sox2 (deposited by Dr Rudolph Jaenisch),
Tet-O-FUW-Brn2 (deposited by Dr Marius Wernig), Tet-O-FUW-FoxG1
(deposited by Dr Marius Wernig) and FUW-M2rtTA (deposited by Dr Rudolph
Jaenisch). All cDNAs were under the control of the tetracycline promoter. Mouse
iNSCs were generated following the method of Lujan et al.6. Overall, 200,000
mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs; a kind gift from Dr Larysa Pevny, UNC) were
seeded in six-well plates coated with poly-L ornithine. The MEFs were isolated
from C57BL/6J mice at E13.5 and utilized at passage number 3. MEFs were
transduced with the LV cocktail containing rTTA, and Sox2, FoxG1 and Brn2
under the control of the tetracycline-inducible promoter in media containing
polybrene (5 mg ml � 1, Sigma). Two days after infection, the media was changed
to N3 media containing fibroblast growth factor (FGF; 10 ng ml � 1, Peprotech),
epidermal growth factor (EGF; 10 ng ml � 1, Peprotech) and doxycycline
(10 mg ml � 1, Sigma)6. Media was changed every 3 days. Neurosphere formation
was induced by culturing in low-adherent flasks (Corning, Tewksbury, MA).
Karyotype analysis was performed using KaryoLogic (Research Triangle Park, NC).
Lentiviral vectors. In addition to the reprogramming vectors described above, the
following LVs were used in this study: LV-GFP-FL, LV-GFP-RLuc, LV-mC-FL,
LV-sTR and LV-diTR. GFP-RLuc and GFP-FL were constructed by amplifying
the cDNA encoding Renilla luciferase or firefly luciferase using the vectors
luciferase-pcDNA3 and pAC-hRluc (Addgene), respectively. Restriction sites were
incorporated in the primers, the resulting fragment was digested with BglII and SalI
and was ligated directionally using BglII/SalI-digested pEGFP-C1 (Clontech).
The GFP-FL or GFP-RLuc fragments were digested with AgeI (blunted) and SalI,
ligated into pTK402 (provided by Dr Tal Kafri, UNC Gene Therapy Center)
and then digested with BamHI (blunted) and XhoI to create LV-GFP-FL or
LV-GFP-RLuc. Similarly, mC-FL was created by amplifying the cDNA encoding
firefly luciferase from luciferase-pcDNA3, ligating into BglII/SalI-digested
mCherry-C1 (Clontech) and ligating the mC-FL fragment into the pTK402 LV
backbone using blunt/XhoI sites. To create LV-sTR and LV-diTR, the cDNA
sequence encoding sTR or diTR was PCR-amplified using custom-synthesized
oligonucleotide templates (Invitrogen). The restriction sites were incorporated into
the primers, the resulting fragment was digested with BamH1 and XhoI and was
ligated in-frame into BamH1/XhoI-digested pLVX plasmid (a kind gift from
Dr Scott Magness, UNC Department of Medicine). Both LV-sTR and LV-diTR
have IRES-GFP (internal ribosomal entry site-GFP) elements in the backbone as
well as in cytomegalovirus-driven puromycin element. All LV constructs were
packaged as LV vectors in 293T/17 cells using a helper virus-free packaging system
as described previously41. iNSCs, GBM cells and WTNSC were transduced with LVs
at varying multiplicity of infection by incubating virions in a culture medium
containing 5 mg ml � 1 polybrene (Sigma), and the cells were visualized for
fluorescent protein expression using fluorescence microscopy.
Cell viability and passage number. To assess the proliferation and passage
number of modified and unmodified iNSCs, iNSCs expressing GFP-FL, sTR or
unmodified cells were seeded in 96-well plates. Cell viability was assessed over a
period of 10 days using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability kit (Promega).
Maximum passage number was assessed by monitoring the number of times
iNSCs, iNSC-sTR or WTNSC were subcultured without alterations in morphology,
growth rate or transduction efficiency.
In vitro differentiation and IHC. To determine the effects of LV modification
on iNSC differentiation, iNSCs were transduced with LV-GFP-FL or LV-sTR.
Engineered or unmodified cells were fixed, permeabilized and incubated with
anti-nestin monoclonal antibody (Millipore, MAB353, 1:250) or anti-Sox2 (Abcam,
AB97959, 1:200). Cells were washed and incubated with mouse anti-goat CF555
secondary antibody (Biotium, 20031, 1:1,000) for 1 h. Cells were then washed,
mounted and imaged using an Olympus FV 1200 confocal inverted microscope.
For differentiation, engineered or non-transduced iNSCs were cultured for 12 days
in N3 media depleted of doxycycline, EGF and FGF. Cells were then stained with
antibodies directed against nestin, GFAP (Millipore, MAB3405, 1:250) or Tuj-1
(Sigma, T8578, 1:1,000) and were detected with CF555 secondary antibodies
(Biotium, 20031, 1:1,000). To determine the percentage of differentiated iNSCs
expressing GFP-FL or sTR compared with unmodified cells, differentiated cells
were additionally incubated with Hoechst 33253 (Sigma-Aldrich, 861405,
10 mg ml � 1) to stain nuclei. The number of differentiated cells was determined by
manually counting positively stained cells determined in at least three
nonoverlapping fields and expressed as a percentage of the total cell determined
by counting Hoechst-positive nuclei. To determine CD133 expression in GBM
cells, GBM8 or 7063 tumour cells were fixed, permeabilized and incubated with
anti-CD133 monoclonal antibody (Millipore, MAB4399, 1:100).
Tissue processing. Immediately after the last imaging session, mice were killed,
perfused with formalin and brains extracted. The tissue was immediately immersed
in formalin. Coronal sections (30 mm) were generated using a Leica CM1850
cryostat (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL). The sections were incubated for 1 h
in a blocking solution (0.3% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 8% goat serum and 0.3%
Triton X-100) at room temperature, followed by incubation at 4 �C overnight with
the following primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution: (1) anti-nestin
(Millipore, MAB353, 1:250), (2) anti-GFAP (Millipore, MAB3405, 1:250),
(3) anti-Tuj-1 (Sigma, T8578, 1:1,000), (4) CD133 (Millipore, MAB4399, 1:100)
and (5) Ki-67 (Dako, M7240, 1:20). The sections were washed three times with
PBS, incubated in the appropriate secondary antibody and visualized using a
confocal microscope (Olympus). Paraffin embedding, tissue sectioning and
haematotoxylin and eosine staining were performed by the UNC Animal
Histopathology Core.
iNSC fate and toxicity studies. To determine the survival of iNSCs in mice,
iNSCs expressing GFP-FL (7.5 � 105 cells per mouse) were suspended in PBS and
implanted stereotaxically in mice (n ¼ 10 per group) in the right frontal lobe 2 mm
lateral from the bregma and 2 mm deep. iNSC survival was determined by biolu-
minescence imaging of mice performed every 7 days for 4 weeks as described
previously13,15,42.
To determine the fate of iNSCs at a cellular resolution, animals were killed
21 days post implantation and brains were extracted and sectioned. Tissue sections
were stained with antibodies against nestin, GFAP and Tuj-1, and visualized using
a secondary antibody labelled with CF555, as is described previously. In a subset of
animals, iNSC-GFPFLs (7.5 � 105 cells per mouse) were mixed with human U87
GBM cells expressing mCherry (5 � 104 cells per mouse; n ¼ 10).
To determine the toxicity of iNSC-sTR in non-tumour brain, iNSC-sTRs
(7.5 � 105 cells per mouse) were stereotactically injected into the parenchyma of
Nude mice (n ¼ 5). Fourteen days later, mice were killed, and their brains were
harvested, embedded in paraffin, sectioned and stained with haematotoxylin and
eosine. The tissue sections were analysed by Dr Ryan Miller (Department of
Pathology, UNC Hospitals). Images were captured 0.5 mm from the glial scar
induced by the needle tract, and the same distance from the midline in the
contralateral (non-stem cell) hemisphere.
Real-time imaging and motion analysis. WTNSC and iNSCs expressing GFP were
seeded in microculture inserts in glass bottom microwell dishes (MatTek, Ashland,
MA) using two-chamber cell culture inserts (Ibidi, Verona, WI). U87 glioma cells
expressing mCherry were plated into the adjacent well (0.5 mm separation) or the
well was left empty (control). Twenty-four hours after plating, cells were placed in a
VivaView live cell imaging system (Olympus) and were allowed to equilibrate.
The insert was removed and cells were imaged at � 20 magnification every 10 min
for 36 h in six locations per well (to monitor sufficient cell numbers) in three
independent experiments. NIH Image was used to generate movies and determine
the migrational total distance migrated and the directionality of migration using
the ‘Manual Tracking’ and ‘Chemotaxis Tool’ plugins.
To determine directional migration, we used an under-agarose cell migration
assay to create multiple chemotactic gradients43. A 0.6% agarose solution was
prepared, and 3 ml was added to each well of six-well culture plates and allowed to
solidify. A 2-ml aspirating pipette attached to a vacuum was used to create three
cavities in the agarose B500 mm apart. iNSCs were seeded in the central well,
U87 GBM cells were seeded in one lateral well and fibroblasts were seeded in the
remaining lateral well. differential interference contrast images were captured 0,
3 and 5 days post seeding to visualize cell migration. iNSC migration was
quantified by manually counting iNSCs present in the iNSC:GBM agarose or
iNSC:fibroblast agarose from multiple visual fields 0, 3 and 5 days post seeding.
iNSC migration in vivo. To determine the migration of iNSC to invasive GBM,
mice (n ¼ 7) were implanted with GBM8 cells expressing mC-FL (5 � 105 cells per
mouse). Three days later, iNSC-GFP-FL (7.5 � 105 cells per mouse) were implanted
into the same implantation site as the GBM8. To assess migration, animals were
killed at 14, 21 and 28 days post implantation. Their brains were processed as
described below. Images were captured showing the distribution of red GBM8
tumour cells and green iNSCs 1–2 mm from the initial site of implantation adjacent
to the lateral ventricle. To determine the migration of iNSCs to established GBMs,
U87-mC-RLs were implanted in mice (5 � 104 cells per mouse, n ¼ 7). Five days
later, iNSC-GFPFLs were implanted in the contralateral hemisphere 2 mm from
the midline. Mice were killed 21 days later and immunofluorescent analysis of
post-mortem tissue sections was used to visualize the colocalization of GFP þ
iNSC with the mCherry þ GBM.
In vitro toxicity assays. To determine the toxicity of iNSC-sTR against multiple
cell types, iNSCs, human neurons (a kind gift from Dr Anne Taylor, UNC
Neuroscience), human astrocytes (ATCC) and U87 GBM cells (5 � 103 cells per
well) were seeded in 96-well plates. Conditioned media collected from iNSC-sTR or
control iNSC-GFP were added to each well. Cell viability was determined 48 h later
using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent assay.
In vitro imaging of diTR secretion. The culture medium containing secreted
fusion proteins or the cells were collected from iNSC-diTR or WTNSC-diTR 24 h

 after refreshing. The luciferase activity in the medium was determined by incu-
bating the medium or cells with 1 mg ml � 1 coelenterazine and was imaged in a
luminometer as described15.
iNSC antitumour efficacy. To determine the therapeutic efficacy of iNSC-sTR
against solid human U87 tumours, a combination of iNSC-sTR or iNSC-GFP-RLuc
(7.5 � 105 cells per mouse) was stereotactically implanted into the right frontal lobe
of mice (n ¼ 12 per group) together with U87-mC-FL cells (1 � 106 cells per
mouse). Therapeutic response was then determined by following tumour volumes
with FL bioluminescence imaging as described previously15,42. Briefly, mice were
given an intraperitoneal injection of D-Luciferin (150 ml of 4.5 mg ml � 1 in saline
solution per mouse) and photon emission was determined 5 min later using an
IVIS Kinetic Optical System (PerkinElmer) with a 5-min acquisition time. Images
were processed and photon emission quantified using the LivingImage software
(PerkinElmer). In addition, mice were followed for survival over time.
To investigate the efficacy of iNSC-sTR against invasive patient-derived human
GBM cells, mice were stereotactically implanted in the right frontal lobe with
GBM8 or 7063 GBM cells expressing mC-FL (5 � 105 cells per mouse). Three days
later, iNSC-sTR (n ¼ 12, 7.5 � 105 cells per mouse) or iNSC-GFP-RLuc (n ¼ 12,
7.5 � 105 cells per mouse) were implanted into the tumour implantation site.
Changes in tumour volume were assessed by FL imaging as described above and
mice were followed for survival over time.
Female Nude mice 4–6 weeks of age were used in all experiments and
purchased from the UNC Animal Studies Core. Mice were bred in-house by the
core. All experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use
Committees at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and care of the
mice was in accordance with the standards set forth by the National Institutes of
Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, USDA regulations, and
the American Veterinary Medical Association.
Cytogenetics. Cytogenetic analysis was performed by Karyologic (Research
Triangle Park), and a total of 20 G-banded metaphase spreads were analysed.
Banding technique used was G-bands by trypsin using Wright stain (GTW) and
banding resolution was reported as ‘good’. Analysis reported karyotype as ‘normal’.
Western blot analysis. iNSCs expressing sTR or diTR or control iNSCs were
lysed with RIPA buffer containing a protease cocktail (Roche, Basel, Switzerland)
and centrifuged at 30,000g for 30 min at 4 �C. Equal amounts of total cell protein
(1, 5, 10 mg) were denatured, separated using SDS–PAGE and transferred to
nitrocellulose membrane, blocked with 5% milk and incubated for 1 h at room
temperature with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to TRAIL (ProSci, Poway, CA, 113,
1 mg ml � 1)15. Blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents
(Amersham). Membranes were then exposed to film for 30 s to 30 min. Images
shown in Supplementary Fig. 4 have been cropped for presentation. Full-size
images are presented in Supplementary Fig. 7.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to determine sTR secretion. The levels
of sTR secretion from iNSCs was determined by measuring sTR levels in
conditioned media with the TRAIL Immunoassay Kit (Biosource International,
Camarillo, CA) following the manufacturer’s protocols. Recombinant human
TRAIL provided in the assay kit was used as a standard.
Flow cytometric analysis. GBM8 cells expressing EGFP (1 � 107 cells) were
washed in PBS and were resuspended in 100 ml of buffer composed of MACS BSA
solution (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-091-376) diluted 1:20 in Auto-MACS Rinsing
Solution (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-091-222). Ten microlitres of the anti-CD133
antibody conjugated to phycoerythrin (PE; Miltenyi Biotec, 130-090-853, 1:100)
was added and the cells were incubated in the dark at 4 �C for 10 min. GBM8 cells
were incubated without the antibody and were processed in the same way for use as
the control. After 10 min of incubation, cells were washed using 1 ml of buffer and
centrifuged at 300g for 10 min. The supernatant was aspirated and the cell pellet
was resuspended in 1 ml buffer. The bench top acquisition was conducted on a
Sony SH800 FACS instrument. Forward Scatter (FSC-area) and Back Scatter (BSC-
area) gates were set to exclude debris and double discrimination gates
(FSC-area versus FSC-height) were set to exclude multimers. Single colour controls
were used to compensate for spectral overlap between EGFP and PE. Negative
cell gates were set on unstained cells and visualized on a bi-variate histogram
(GBM8-EGFP versus CD133-PE). Cells positive for CD133 were quantified using
the ratio of cells that fell above the negative cell gates for CD133-PE. A subset of
cells was analysed with confocal microscopy to visually confirm the percentage of
GFP þ GBM8 cells that stained positive for the CD133-PE.
Statistical analysis. Data were analysed by Student’s t-test and paired t-test when
comparing two groups, and by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), two-way
ANOVA and repeated measures when comparing more than two groups. Survival
times of mouse groups were compared using exact log-rank test. Data were
expressed as mean±s.e.m., and differences were considered significant at Po0.05.
