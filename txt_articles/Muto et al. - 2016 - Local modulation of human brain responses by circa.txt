 A schematic design of an epidermal touch
panel is shown in Fig. 4A. The epidermal touch
panel was built on a 1-mm-thick VHB film (3M,
Maplewood, MN) so as to insulate the panel from
the body. Because VHB film was originally de-
veloped as an adhesive, the panel could be at-
tached to an arm without using extra glues (Fig.
4B). The epidermal touch panel was fully trans-
parent so that it could convey visual content
behind the touch panel. Moreover, the panel
was mechanically soft and stretchable so that
a user is comfortable with movement while
wearing it. The currents measured before and
after attachment are plotted in Fig. 4C. The base-
line currents increased after the attachment ow-
ing to a leakage of charges through the VHB
substrate. The thicker insulating layer generated
a smaller baseline current. The effect of thick-
ness of the insulating layers on the baseline cur-
rents is shown in fig. S8. The sensitivity to touch
decreased after the attachment; however, the
touching current was still sufficient to be de-
tected. As shown in Fig. 4D, we subsequently
touched from TP#1 to TP#4 on the epidermal
touch panel, and the current was measured with
the A1 current meter. The correlation between
the measured currents and the touched posi-
tion was not influenced by the attachment. The
epidermal touch panel could successfully per-
ceive various motions, such as tapping, holding,
dragging, and swiping. Thus, various applica-
tions can be easily managed by integrating the
panel. As shown in Fig. 4, E to G, writing words
(Fig. 4E), playing music (Fig. 4F), and playing
chess (Fig. 4G) were accomplished via adequate
motions on the epidermal touch panel (movies
S3 to S6).
We have demonstrated a highly stretchable
and transparent ionic touch panel. We used a
PAAm hydrogel containing 2 M LiCl salts as
an ionic conductor. We investigated the mech-
anism of position-sensing in an ionic touch pan-
el with a 1D strip. The ionic touch strip showed
precise and fast touch-sensing, even in a highly
stretched state. We expanded the position-
sensing mechanism to a 2D panel. We could
draw a figure using the 2D ionic touch panel.
The ionic touch panel could be operated under
>1000% areal strain. An epidermal touch panel
was developed based on the ionic touch panel.
The epidermal touch panel could be applied onto
arbitrarily curved human skin, and its use was
demonstrated by writing words and playing the
piano and games.

Human performance is modulated by circadian rhythmicity and homeostatic sleep pressure.
Whether and how this interaction is represented at the regional brain level has not been
established. We quantified changes in brain responses to a sustained-attention task during
13 functional magnetic resonance imaging sessions scheduled across the circadian cycle,
during 42 hours of wakefulness and after recovery sleep, in 33 healthy participants. Cortical
responses showed significant circadian rhythmicity, the phase of which varied across brain
regions. Cortical responses also significantly decreased with accrued sleep debt. Subcortical
areas exhibited primarily a circadian modulation that closely followed the melatonin profile.
These findings expand our understanding of the mechanisms involved in maintaining cognition
during the day and its deterioration during sleep deprivation and circadian misalignment.
F
orgoing sleep and staying up at night, be it
for professional or recreational reasons, is
highly prevalentinmodernsocieties(1).Acute
sleep loss leads to deterioration of multiple
aspects of cognition (2) and is associated
with increased risk of human errors and health
hazards (3). These effects are often attributed to
the mere lack of sleep. However, despite the pro-
gressive buildup of sleep pressure during wake-
fulness, human performance remains remarkably
well preserved until wakefulness is extended into
the biological night. This is attributed to a puta-
tive circadian alerting signal that increases during
the day and reaches its peak in the early evening,
close to the rise of melatonin concentration, to
counter the mounting homeostatic sleep pressure
(4–6). Cognition deteriorates rapidly and substan-
tially when wakefulness is extended into the night
and early morning hours. This is attributed to the
accumulated sleep pressure and the dissipation of
the circadian alerting signal (6, 7). Whether and
how this interaction between homeostatic sleep
pressure and circadian rhythmicity is represented
atthe regional brain level is not known. Single–time

 point assessments of human brain responses to
various cognitive tasks after acute sleep loss have
demonstrated changes consistent with sleep loss’
detrimental influence on brain information process-
ing (8). However, an assessment of the time course
of brain responses during sleep loss is currently
not available.
Weusedrepeatedfunctionalmagneticresonance
imaging (fMRI) sessions to assess whether brain
responses are modulated by circadian rhythmicity
during sustained wakefulness, and how circadian
rhythmicity interacts with the sleep pressure ac-
cumulated with elapsed time awake and its dis-
sipation during recovery sleep. Young healthy
volunteers (17 men, 16 women; age 21.12 ± 1.7)
stayed awake under constant environmental and
behavioral conditions for a 42-hour period. The
experiment started in the morning and covered
two biological days, a full biological night, and the
beginning of a second biological night. Brain
responses were assessed in 12 fMRI sessions clus-
tered in the morning (hours ~05 to 09) and the
evening/early night (hours 21 to 01), two periods
characterized by rapid changes in the circadian
modulation of cognitive performance. A 13th fMRI
session took place after recovery sleep (Fig. 1A).
Circadian phase was determined from the cen-
tral circadian pacemaker–driven melatonin rhythm
(9), which showed a typical profile with low levels
during the day and a sudden increase in the late

 evening hours [mean dim-light melatonin onset
(DLMO), 22:33 ± 00:09 (SEM)]. Sleep during the
12-hour recovery night following the sleep depri-
vation was characterized by shorter sleep latency,
increased sleep efficiency, total sleep time, and
rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep,
thereby confirming the increase in sleep pressure
relative to baseline (tables S1 and S2).
Subjective sleepiness, negative affect, and delta
and theta electroencephalographic (EEG) power
increased with elapsed time awake and returned
to baseline after recovery sleep. These variables
also showed a circadian modulation, with poor-
est ratings observed at the end of the biological
night (at approximately 8:00 a.m.) and at the
end of the sleep deprivation (at approximately
01:00 a.m.)—that is, after melatonin had risen
again (Fig. 1, C to E).
During fMRI sessions, participants performed
the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) (10), which gen-
erated data on reaction times to pseudo-randomly
occurring low-frequency stimuli (11). Reflecting
the effects of elapsed time awake and circadian
phase, performance remained relatively stable
during the first day, significantly declined after
the first and second melatonin onsets, partially
recovered during the second day, and returned to
baseline after recovery sleep (Fig. 1B) (12).
A first fMRI voxelwise analysis identified any
significant circadian periodicity in brain response
profiles by combining two orthogonal regressors:

 scan time. A significant circadian modulation
was detected in a large set of cortical areas, involv-
ing nearly the whole cortical mantle [P < 0.05, false
discovery rate (FDR) over the whole brain; Fig. 2A
and table S3], with the exception of the dorso-
lateral prefrontal cortex.
Analyses of response phase showed significant
variation across brain regions (Friedmann test,
c2 = 30.13, df = 4, P = 4.60 × 10−6) and a range
spanning ~250° to ~320° relative to melatonin se-
cretion onset (DLMO), with maximum responses
occurring earlier in occipital and allocortical areas
(amygdalaandcingulatecortex)thaninmultimodal
association areas (precuneus, temporal cortex, and
prefrontal areas; Fig. 2, B to D). The predicted re-
sponse profiles peaked during the subjective after-
noon and reached their nadir in the second part
of the night, up to the early morning hours, close
to the offset of melatonin levels (Fig. 2D).
Although this analysis established a circadian
modulation of regional brain responses, it assumed
that the latter fluctuated as a sine wave—an as-
sumption that does not correspond to actual time
courses of most circadian biomarkers (12, 13). A
second analysis evaluated the circadian modula-
tion of PVT brain responses using an empirical
marker of the circadian process: the mean mel-
atonin level across volunteers (Fig. 3A, red). We
simultaneously assessed whether brain responses
to the PVT were modulated by accumulating sleep
pressure (blue) and how circadian rhythm and
homeostatic sleep pressure interact (green). Be-
cause no pure marker of homeostatic sleep pres-
sure can be derived from empirical data obtained
during sleep deprivation, its effect was modeled
as monotonically decreasing with elapsed time
awake and increasing after recovery sleep (12), as
empirically observed (14) and usually modeled (15).
This second analysis indicated that the time
course of responses significantly correlated with
mean melatonin levels in a number of subcorti-
cal areas (midbrain, cerebellum, basal ganglia, and
thalamus) and in a few cortical areas (primary
sensorimotor cortices, occipital pole, and intra-
parietal sulcus), confirming a significant main
effect of circadian rhythm in these regions (Fig. 3B,
red areas, and table S5). In these areas, there was
no significant effect of sleep debt. A significant
negative effect of sleep debt was observed in a
large set of cortical areas that spanned high-
order association cortices of the frontal, parietal,
insular, and cingulate cortices as well as visual
and sensorimotor cortices (Fig. 3B, blue areas,
and table S4). Their response pattern showed a
decrease in response to elapsed time awake, with
a return to baseline levels after recovery sleep
(Fig. 3B, blue areas, and table S4). Their param-
eter estimates, adjusted to melatonin onset, also
revealed a substantial (although not significant)
circadian modulation, characterized by a rapid de-
crease in responses during the late subjective night
or early subjective morning, around the melatonin
offset. The circadian modulation appears more
tightly in phase with melatonin levels in posterior
areasthaninmoreanteriorareas,accountingforthe
significant interaction between sleep pressure and
circadian rhythmicity observed in occipital poles
and thalamic areas (Fig. 3B, green areas, and
table S6). Note that a transient increase of mod-
eled cortical responses was no longer located in
the “circadian” afternoon (as seen in analysis 1)
but instead appeared immediately before the
onset of melatonin secretion (Fig. 3B, response
time courses relative to DLMO in frontal, parietal,
and temporal cortices), a circadian time associated
with low sleep propensity known as the wake
maintenance zone (6).
Brain responses to an n-back task were also
recorded during fMRI sessions. Executive re-
sponses (3-back > 0-back) in the bilateral anterior
insula were significantly modulated by a circadian
oscillation, synchronous to the melatonin rhythm
[P < 0.05, familywise error (FWE) over the whole
brain] (12) (fig. S1). This finding rules out a global
task-independent circadian influence and sug-
gests the influence of a local, region-specific, task-
dependent circadian signal.
These findings reveal a pervasive effect of cir-
cadian rhythmicity and homeostatic sleep pres-
sure on cortical responses during a sustained
attention task. The interaction between circa-
dian signals and sleep debt was formally proven
in occipital areas, although inspection of response
time courses suggests that both factors influence
responses of many more cortical areas (Fig. 3B,
right panels).
It appears that the respective influence of sleep
debt and circadian rhythmicity is more balanced
in posterior cortical areas, whereassleep debt exerts
a disproportionately larger influence in more an-
terior, associative areas. However, this generaliza-
tion should be confirmed by further experimental
data based on various cognitive tasks that are
differentially affected by sleep loss and circadian
rhythmicity (2).
More important, our results demonstrate a
regional modulation of brain circadian rhythmi-
city. Several subcortical responses show a strong
circadian modulation but no significant influence
of sleep debt. By contrast, in most cortical areas,
sleeppressureexertsawidespreadnegativeinfluence
on regional responses. This differential regulation of
brain responses might explain the supposedly
“compensatory” responses repeatedly reported
in thalamic areas during sleep loss (8). In the
morning after sleep deprivation (8 to 12 hours
after DLMO, the typical assessment time point
in fMRI studies of acute sleep deprivation), tha-
lamic and striatal responses are indeed larger
than in cortical areas. However, these strong tha-
lamic responses might not reflect a compensa-
tion for the detrimental effects of accumulating
sleep debt; they may merely indicate a dependency
of cortical and subcortical response amplitude
on the circadian phase (Fig. 3B). This observation
highlights the importance of considering circa-
dian phase when investigating the effects of sleep
loss on brain mechanisms.
There is also a local modulation of cerebral
circadian phase. This suggests that the circadian
rhythmicity imposed by the master clock, located
in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypotha-
lamus, can to some extent be locally altered, po-
tentially in response to task-related requirements.
The mechanisms of this local modulation are un-
known. Local changes in clock gene expression
(16, 17) or posttranslational circadian mecha-
nisms may be involved. Clock gene expression
is sensitive to neuronal metabolic changes [e.g.,
redox state (18, 19)] and is altered in response to
sleep debt (20).
These data demonstrate that sleep homeosta-
sis and circadian rhythmicity affect brain responses,
in accordance with current views on the regulation
of sleep and waking performance. They also re-
quire a reformulation of these views to include
the relative contributions of circadian rhythmic-
ity and homeostatic sleep pressure to regionally
specific (i.e., local) brain function. Our findings
have implications for the understanding of the
brain mechanisms underlying the maintenance
of daytime cognitive performance and its dete-
rioration, as observed in shift work, jet lag, sleep
disorders, aging, and neurodegenerative diseases.
