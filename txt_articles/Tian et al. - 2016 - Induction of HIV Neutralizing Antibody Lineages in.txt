 The design of immunogens that elicit broadly reactive neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) has been a 
major obstacle to HIV-1 vaccine development. One approach to assess potential immunogens is to 
use mice expressing precursors of human bnAbs as vaccination models. The bnAbs of the VRC01-
class derive from the IGHV1-2 immunoglobulin heavy chain and neutralize a wide spectrum of 
HIV-1 strains via targeting the CD4 binding site of the envelope glycoprotein gp120. We now 
describe a mouse vaccination model that allows a germline human IGHV1-2*02 segment to 
undergo normal V(D)J recombination and, thereby, leads to the generation of peripheral B cells 
that express a highly diverse repertoire of VRC01-related receptors. When sequentially immunized 
with modified gp120 glycoproteins designed to engage VRC01 germline and intermediate 
antibodies, IGHV1-2*02-rearranging mice, which also express a VRC01-antibody precursor light 
chain, can support the affinity maturation of VRC01 precursor antibodies into HIV-neutralizing 
antibody lineages.
Short Paragraph/eTOC
Sequential immunization using modified HIV envelope glycoproteins supports the maturation of 
HIV-neutralizing antibody lineages in mouse models that have diverse antibody repertoire and 
therefore are closer to physiological immunization settings than conventional transgenic models.
INTRODUCTION
A major hurdle to the development of an effective HIV-1 vaccine has been the difficulty in 
designing vaccine immunogens, and immunization strategies, that induce antibodies able to 
neutralize the majority of diverse HIV-1 strains. Cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies arise 
over several years in about half of HIV-1 infected subjects, and highly potent broadly cross-
reactive antibodies (bnAbs) arise in a subset of this group. Their broad neutralizing activity 
stems from their ability to recognize relatively conserved epitopes on the HIV-1 envelope 
(Env) protein and to accommodate natural variations within such epitopes (Burton and 
Hangartner, 2016; Kwong and Mascola, 2012; Mascola and Haynes, 2013). The VRC01-

 class of bnAbs targets the CD4-binding site of HIV-1 (Scheid et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2010; 
Zhou et al., 2010). Because the CD4-binding site is essential for HIV-1 entry into host T 
cells, this region of HIV-1 envelope protein (Env) is conserved despite the overall diversity 
of HIV-1 strains. Given its broad and potent neutralization activity, induction of VRC01-
class bnAbs is a prime goal for vaccine development.
VRC01-class antibodies share common characteristics (Zhou et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2015; 
Zhou et al., 2013). The immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy (IgH) chain variable region is encoded 
by an exon assembled from different germline VH, D and JH gene segments during B cell 
development (Alt et al., 2013). Among the 38–46 functional VH segments in the human IgH 
locus, IGHV1-2 is used exclusively in VRC01-class antibodies, because IGHV1-2 can act as 
a structural mimic of CD4 (Zhou et al., 2010). VRC01 Ig light (IgL) chains make less 
important contributions to antigen contact, and different IgL chains are compatible with 
VRC01 binding activity (Wu et al., 2011). However, all VRC01 light chains have a short 
complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) antigen-binding loop, which is encoded by 
the junctional region of V and J gene segments. VRC01 IgL chain CDR3s (CDR L3s) are 
invariably 5-amino acid long, which is far below the average human CDR L3 length. The 
short VRC01 CDR L3 avoids steric clashes between VRC01 and the Env gp120 V5 loop 
(Zhou et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2013). A third remarkable feature of 
VRC01-class antibodies is that up to 32% of their variable region exon sequences arise via 
somatic hypermutation (SHM) (Scheid et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2011), a 
process that takes place in activated B cells within germinal centers in peripheral lymphoid 
tissues and improves antigen-binding affinity (Victora and Nussenzweig, 2012).
Given the unusual VRC01-class characteristics, inducing such antibodies by vaccination is a 
daunting task. The immunogen must engage B cells that express a precursor antibody 
(termed “umutated common ancestor” or “UCA”) composed of an unmutated IGHV1-2 
heavy chain and an IgL chain with a 5-amino acid CDR L3; given the low frequency of 5-
amino acid CDR L3s such B cells are expected to be very rare (Jardine et al., 2015; Jardine 
et al., 2016). In contrast to the broad and potent neutralization activity of mature VRC01-
class antibodies, the inferred VRC01 UCA does not interact appreciably with gp120 or the 
native Env trimer (Hoot et al., 2013; McGuire et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2010). Thus, it has 
been proposed that induction of such bnAbs would require targeting with an immunogen 
that binds the UCA with sufficient affinity to prime the corresponding B cells, followed by 
subsequent sequential immunizations with modified Env-based proteins designed to engage 
VRC01 intermediates that stimulate SHM and affinity maturation into bnAbs (Haynes et al., 
2012; Jardine et al., 2013; Liao et al., 2009; McGuire et al., 2013; Xiao et al., 2009).
Based on the above considerations, HIV gp120 has been engineered into forms that interact 
with germline VRC01-class antibodies (Jardine et al., 2013; Jardine et al., 2016; McGuire et 
al., 2016; McGuire et al., 2013). The efficacy of these germline VRC01 binders has been 
evaluated in immunization experiments in mouse models where the precursor form of 
VRC01 IgH or IgL genes have been integrated into the corresponding mouse Ig loci 
(Dosenovic et al., 2015; Jardine et al., 2015; McGuire et al., 2016). In such “knock-in” 
mouse models, B cells express the rearranged VRC01 IgH or IgL precursor antibody and 
serve as target cells for test immunogens. It has been shown that a high affinity germline

 VRC01 binder, eOD-GT8 60mer (Jardine et al., 2015), selectively activates B cells 
expressing a V(D)J exon consisting of a germline IGHV1-2*02 fused to a CDR H3 sequence 
from a mature VRC01-class antibody (Dosenovic et al., 2015; Jardine et al., 2015). 
Moreover, eOD-GT8 60mer immunization expanded B cells that were enriched for 
antibodies in which the human IgH chain was paired with mouse IgL chains containing 5-
amino acid CDR L3s. However, since the human VRC01 IgH chain employed in this knock-
in model contained a CDR H3 from a mature VRC01 antibody, the response did not arise 
from germline variable regions. Moreover, IGHV1-2*02 would be associated with diverse 
CDR H3s in a human population; thus, an effective vaccine would need to function in such a 
context. Finally, no prior immunization studies with engineered gp120 immunogens have 
elicited HIV-1 neutralizing activities (Dosenovic et al., 2015; Jardine et al., 2015; McGuire 
et al., 2016).
To circumvent some potential shortcomings of standard knock-in models, we developed 
VRC01 vaccine models based on findings from our prior studies of V(D)J recombination 
regulation. Although all mouse VHs are represented at varying frequencies in the VH(D)JH 
repertoire of mature B lymphocytes, the most D-proximal VH (“VH81X”, IGHV5-2 in 
IMGT nomenclature) is utilized frequently for primary VH(D)JH rearrangements. 
Nevertheless, VH81X rarely contributes to antibodies expressed by peripheral B cells, due to 
inability to pair properly with IgL or surrogate IgL chains and a propensity to encode auto-
reactive antibodies (Alt et al., 2013). Rearrangement of VH81X is under the control of a 
major V(D)J recombination regulatory element, termed intergenic control region 1 (IGCR1) 
(Guo et al., 2011). When IGCR1 is inactivated, VH81X is used in the vast majority of VH to 
DJH rearrangements, despite integrity of the remaining IgH locus (Guo et al., 2011; Hu et 
al., 2015). Based on these observations, we hypothesized that, in place of VH81X, the 
human IGHV1-2*02 would similarly dominate VH usage in the context of IGCRI deletion. 
Moreover, as IGHV1-2*02 is well represented in the human antibody repertoire (DeKosky et 
al., 2016; Lin et al., 2016), it may not be subject to negative selection, allowing high 
representation in the primary VH repertoire to translate into prevalent expression in mature B 
cells. In such a model, IGHV-1-2*02 would recombine with various mouse D and JH 
segments, with junctional diversification mechanisms (Alt et al., 2013) creating a diverse 
range of CDR H3’s with this single human VH. Relative to mouse models where 
IGHV1-2*02 is linked to a fixed CDR H3, such a model could provide a more physiological 
setting to test the efficacy of candidate immunogens.
We now report that, when subjected to a sequential immunization strategy, these VH1-2*02-
rearranging vaccination mouse models allow maturation of VRC01 precursor antibodies into 
HIV-1 neutralizing antibody lineages.
RESULTS
A mouse model that expresses IGHV1-2*02 in association with diverse CDR3s
We replaced VH81X with IGHV1-2*02 and deleted IGCRI on one IgH allele in mouse 
embryonic stem (ES) cells (Figure 1A, Figure S1A and B). To assay these ES cells, we 
employed Rag2-deficient blastocyst complementation (“RDBC”), which involves injecting 
test ES cells into Rag2-deficient blastocysts to generate chimeric mice (Chen et al., 1993).

 Because Rag2 is essential for V(D)J recombination, all B and T cells in the chimeric mice 
originate from the injected ES cells (Figure 1B). Therefore, such RDBC chimeras can be 
used directly for immunization experiments. To maximize the frequency of B cells 
expressing IGHV1-2*02 for some experiments, we also bred RDBC chimeras for germline 
transmission and generation of mice homozygous for the IGHV1-2*02 replacement and 
IGCRI deletion mutations (Figure 1A, Figure S1A and B). We refer to these RDBC 
chimeras and germline mice as the VH1-2 mouse model.
Based on FACS analysis of the expression of several cell surface markers, splenic B and T 
cell populations of VH1-2 mice appeared comparable to control mice (Figure S1C). To 
assess frequency of IGHV1-2*02 and D usage, as well as CDR3 length and diversity among 
peripheral B cells in the VH1-2 model, we employed the recently described HTGTS-rep-seq 
method (Lin et al., 2016). This assay revealed that 45% of splenic B cells express 
IGHV1-2*02 heavy chains (Figure 1C). Moreover, IGHV1-2*02-expressing B cells 
employed all mouse D segments, but with a higher frequency of DQ52 (IGHD4-1 in IMGT 
nomenclature) and a shorter peak CDRH3 length relative to B cells in normal mice (10 
versus 11 amino acids) (Figure 1D and E)(Lin et al., 2016). Due to use of normal junctional 
diversification mechanisms in their assembly, IGHV1-2*02 heavy chain variable regions in 
VH1-2 mice collectively contain a tremendously diverse range of CDR H3 sequences 
(Figure 1D and E, bottom)(Lin et al., 2016).
We did not introduce the VRC01 IgL chain into the VH1-2 mouse model, because the model 
was designed to test whether a high affinity antigen for the germline VRC01 antibody could 
engage B cells in which diverse IGHV1-2*02-containing V(D)J IgH chains were paired with 
different mouse IgL chains containing 5-amino acid CDR L3s. This model could better 
approximate the challenge of germline-targeting in humans compared to the knock-in mice 
with a V(D)J IgH chain with a single CDR H3 used in prior tested models. We also used 
HTGTS-rep-seq to assess the frequency of Igκ chains with 5-amino acid CDR L3s in VH1-2 
model B cells. As in normal mice (Lin et al., 2016), the majority VH1-2 model Igκ variable 
region exons encoded a 9-amino acid long CDR3, with 5-amino acid CDR L3s found in only 
about 0.15% of expressed Igκ chains (Figure 1F). Thus, the VH1-2 mouse model provided a 
stringent setting to evaluate ability of candidate immunogens to selectively prime B cells 
expressing antibodies with VRC01 signatures.
Selective activation of B cells expressing VRC01 type antibodies
A wild-type gp120 or Env trimers would not be effective antigens for immunization 
experiments with the VH1-2 model since they do not interact appreciably with germline 
VRC01 antibody (Hoot et al., 2013; McGuire et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2010). Therefore, we 
employed a recently described gp120-based immunogen, referred to as engineered outer 
domain-GT8 (eOD-GT8), which has been engineered to bind with high affinity to germline 
VRC01-class antibodies (Jardine et al., 2016). This protein was expressed as part of a 60-
subunit self-assembling nanoparticle (60mer). Based on binding assays, eOD-GT8 60mer 
stably binds to predicted germline precursors from different donors with diverse CDR H3s 
and IgL chains.

 We immunized the VH1-2 mouse model with 15, 30, or 60 μg of eOD-GT8 60mer along 
with poly I:C adjuvant (Figure 2A). The immunization appeared to elicit antibodies that 
target the CD4 binding site, as demonstrated by the detection of higher titers of antibody 
against eOD-GT8 than against ΔeOD-GT8 (the CD4bs-KO mutant) in all mice two weeks 
after immunization (Figure 2B). Correspondingly, the frequency of IgG+ B cells specific for 
the gp120 CD4 binding site increased in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2C and 2D). 
Similar to immunization studies with germline VRC01 heavy chain knock-in mouse models 
(Dosenovic et al., 2015; Jardine et al., 2015), a substantial fraction of the immune response 
was not specific for the CD4 binding site, as evidenced by binding to the ΔeOD-GT8 (Figure 
2B), as well as by the population of B cells that bind equally to eOD-GT8 and ΔeOD-GT8 
(Figure 2C and Figure S2A). Given that the mice were immunized only once with eOD-
GT8, additional boosts with heterologous gp120 antigens may help focus the immune 
response toward the CD4 binding site. To isolate and characterize CD4 binding site-specific 
antibodies, we sorted single splenic B cells that bound eOD-GT8, but not ΔeOD-GT8 
(Figure S2A) and cloned IgH and IgL chains. Among B cells sorted from mice immunized 
with 30μg and 60μg eOD-GT8 60mer, some expressed the IGHV1-2*02 V-gene in 
association with IgL chains containing a 5-amino acid CDR L3, with enrichment for the 
conserved VRC01-class QQY motif (Figure 2E; Figure 2F). Given the extremely low 
frequency of IgL chains with a 5-amino acid CDR3s in the pre-immune repertoire (Figure 
1F), these results indicated strong selection for B cells encoding antibodies with VRC01 IgL 
signatures.
Among mouse IgL chains, certain Vκ4 family members were over-represented (Table S1), 
potentially because these V segments encode the QQY motif conserved in the CDR L3 of 
VRC01-class antibodies. To test binding specificity of the isolated antibodies composed of 
IGHV1-2*02 IgH chains and mouse IgL chains with 5-amino acid CDR L3s, we produced 
them as recombinant antibodies. All of these antibodies were highly specific for a functional 
CD4 binding site, based on binding affinities to eOD-GT8 and ΔeOD-GT8 (Figure 2G and 
Figure S2B). However, none of these antibodies, which resulted from a single immunization, 
exhibited HIV neutralizing activity (Duan, H, Cheng, C., Chen, X., and Mascola, J., 
unpublished data). Of note, among the isolated VRC01 type antibodies, IGHV1-2*02 is 
associated with different CDR H3’s (Table S1). In contrast, when we immunized VH1-2 
mice with immunogens that had lower germline-binding affinity to VRC01-class antibodies 
than eOD-GT8 60mer, including eOD-GT6 60mer, 426c-Ferritin and C13-Ferritin particles, 
not a single IgL chain with 5aa CDR L3 was amplified from 473 sorted CD4bs-specific B 
cells (Table S2). Together, these results indicate that it is feasible to selectively activate B 
cells expressing diverse precursors of VRC01 type antibodies using a high affinity germline 
VRC01 binder.
To complement the single-cell based analysis, we used a high throughput paired sequencing 
method (DeKosky et al., 2015) to assess the effect of immunization on the enrichment of IgL 
chain transcripts with 5-amino acid CDR L3s at the population level. These analyses 
demonstrated that immunization with eOD-GT8 60mer substantially elevated the 
frequencies of 5-amino acid CDR L3 IgL chains paired with IGHV1-2*02 IgH chains. The 
increase was observed only in B cells that had undergone class switching to IgG or IgA, 
indicating the enrichment was a consequence of B cell activation (Figure 2H; Figure S2C 
Tian et al.

 and Table S3). In conjunction with single-cell analyses described above, these results 
suggest that eOD-GT8 60mer can serve as an effective priming immunogen to elicit VRC01-
type antibodies, even in the context of complex IgH and IgL chain repertoires.
A mouse model with diverse IGHV1-2*02 IgH chains and a VRC01 precursor IgL chain
The paucity of IgL chains with 5-amino acid CDR L3s would lead to a similarly low 
frequency of potential VRC01 precursors in VH1-2 mice, making it difficult to test the 
efficacy of immunogens to mature precursor antibodies. Mouse Vκ segments also may not 
provide an optimal context for affinity maturation of IGHV1-2*02. Thus, we generated a 
related, but distinct, mouse model to facilitate VRC01 affinity maturation studies by 
integrating a rearranged version of a VRC01 Igκ variable region exon into the mouse Jκ 
locus of IGHV1-2*02/ΔIGCRI ES cells (Figure 3A, Figure S3A and B). This Igκ variable 
region exon is composed of germline human IGKV3-20*01, which is used in many VRC01-
class antibodies, and includes a 5-amino acid CDR L3 derived from the mature VRC01 
antibody (Figure S3B). The use of a CDR L3 from the mature VRC01 antibody was based 
on two considerations. First, the mature CDR L3 is not only 5-amino acids long, but also 
contains an E residue that is conserved in VRC01-class antibodies (Zhou et al., 2013; Zhou 
et al., 2015). Second, the CDR L3 of the bona fide VRC01 UCA is unknown. Thus, the 
VRC01 IgL chain in this second mouse model is essentially a hybrid of germline IGKV3-20 
and the mature CDR L3 containing human Jκ1. We refer to this IgL chain as the “precursor 
VRC01 IgL”. We also deleted the JH region from the IgH allele that does not contain 
IGHV1-2*02, thereby limiting IgH chain expression to the IGHV1-2*02/ΔIGCR1 allele 
(Figure 3A, Figure S3A and B). We refer to these multiply modified ES cells as VH1-2/LC 
ES cells.
We employed VH1-2/LC ES cells for RDBC and used the chimeras for the next sets of 
immunization experiments. In this case, use of RDBC chimeras was advantageous over 
conventional germline breeding, during which the genetic modifications on three different 
chromosomes would independently segregate. Similar to VH1-2 mice, splenic lymphocyte 
populations of VH1-2/LC mice appeared normal based on expression of several cell surface 
markers (Figure S1C). HTGTS-rep-seq analysis revealed that, in VH1-2/LC mice, 
approximately 40% of splenic B cells express IGHV1-2*02 IgH chains (Figure 3B). 
Moreover, due to junctional diversification mechanisms, the IGHV1-2*02 segments in these 
IgH chains were associated with CDR H3s that employed all D segments, covered a broad 
length range, and were highly diverse (Figure 3C and D). HTGTS-rep-seq also revealed that 
that the precursor VRC01 IgL chain dominated the Igκ repertoire of VH1-2/LC B cells 
(Figure S3C). Finally, single-cell RT-PCR showed that 94% IgM+IgDhi mature splenic B 
cells expressed immature VRC01 Igκ chains (Figure 3E). Thus, the knock-in precursor 
VRC01 IgL effectively excluded the rearrangement and expression of endogenous mouse 
IgL. We conclude that the VH1-2/LC model contains a large and diverse pool of precursor 
VRC01 IgH- and IgL-expressing B cells that could serve as potential targets for 
immunization.

 Induction of neutralizing antibodies through stepwise immunization
We employed stepwise immunization to help guide affinity maturation of VH1-2/LC B cells 
towards the end point of neutralizing VRC01-class antibodies (Figure 4A). The overall 
strategy was to prime the immune response with high affinity germline VRC01 binder and 
boost with a series of immunogens displaying progressively decreased affinity toward 
germline relative to mature VRC01 antibodies. Specifically, we primed with eOD-GT6 
60mer, which was available and is closely related to eOD-GT8 60mer, but has weaker and 
less broad reactivity to VRC01-class inferred precursors (Jardine et al., 2016). In subsequent 
boosts we used a modified gp120 core protein derived from HIV-1 strain 426c (McGuire et 
al., 2013). For the first boost, we used 426c degly-3_Ferritin; in this 24mer nanoparticle 
form of gp120 core, three N-linked glycosylation sites near the CD4 binding site, which 
interfere with the binding of germline VRC01 antibody, were mutated and the variable 
domains 1,2, and 3 were deleted (McGuire et al., 2016). Although eOD-GT6 60mer and 
426c degly-3_Ferrritin are both designed to bind germline VRC01-class antibodies, they are 
derived from different gp120 backbones, namely the gp120s from clade B and clade C 
viruses, respectively. In addition, relative to eOD-GT6, a minimal outer domain of gp120, 
the 426c degly-3 core contains both the outer and inner domains, and is, thus, closer to the 
native form of gp120. Sequential immunization with these two antigens may help focus the 
immune response toward the conserved CD4 binding site. The effect of glycosylation at 
N276, N460 and N463 on germline VRC01 binding is well-characterized for the 426c gp120 
(McGuire et al., 2013). In subsequent boost immunizations, we used 426c gp120 core 
monomers retaining one, two or three of these glycosylation sites. With the gradual 
restoration of glycosylation sites, these antigens display decreasing affinity for the germline 
VRC01-class antibodies, but retain similar binding to fully matured VRC01-class antibodies 
(Figure 4B). Our final boost used a native trimer form of 426c (426c-WT SOSIP). By 
immunizing with this series of antigens, we aimed to select for antibodies with sufficient 
affinity maturation to recognize more native forms of gp120. For comparison, we also 
immunized VH1-2/LC mice with BG505 SOSIP (Sanders et al., 2013), a stabilized native 
Env trimer that interacts poorly with germline VRC01-class antibodies.
We monitored the immune response by serum ELISA (Figure 4C). In mice treated with 
stepwise immunization we detected higher titers of VRC01-class antibodies against 
engineered versions of gp120 outer domain or core with a functional CD4 binding site 
(eOD-GT6, C13, 426c-dgly3) relative to gp120 with a defective CD4 binding site (ΔeOD-
GT6, ΔC13, Δ426-degly3), suggesting that stepwise immunization elicited antibodies 
specific for the CD4 binding site of gp120. By comparison, immunization with BG505 
SOSIP induced lower overall antibody titers for gp120 (Figure 4C). Similarly, flow 
cytometry revealed that immunization induced B cells that appeared to target the CD4 
binding site (Figure 4D). Comparing the two immunization protocols, stepwise 
immunization yielded more CD4bs-specific B cells with overall higher eOD-GT6 staining 
signals. In parallel with the induction of CD4bs-specific antibodies, serum from stepwise 
immunized mice exhibited neutralizing activities against 426c viruses that lack all three 
(N276D, N460D, N463D) or lacked only the N276 glycosylation (N276D) sites (Figure 4E).

 the N276 glycan (Wu et al., 2012), indicating some heterologous neutralization of elicited 
antibodies. On the other hand, the immunization did not effectively or consistently elicit 
antibodies that could neutralize viruses with intact N276 glycosylation (i.e., 426c and 
426c.N460D.N463D, BG505)(Figure 4E). Comparing the two immunization methods, the 
stepwise immunization scheme was superior to immunization with BG505 SOSIP, which 
failed to elicit detectable serum neutralization activities, as observed previously in related 
knock-in mouse models (Dosenovic et al., 2015; Jardine et al., 2015).
To characterize induced antibodies, we sorted eOD-GT6-specific B cells and cloned IgH and 
IgL chain pairs from individual B cells (Figure S2A). We focused our analysis on antibodies 
composed of IGHV1-2*02 heavy chain and IGKV3-20*01 light chains (Table S4), in 
particular their somatic hypermutation, binding, and neutralization activities. Over the 
course of 22 weeks of stepwise immunization, the mutation frequency of both the 
IGHV1-2*02 IgH and VRC01 IgL chains steadily increased, reaching up to 9% and 5%, 
respectively (Figure 5A). Moreover, the mutation patterns of IGHV1-2*02 after 22 weeks of 
immunization showed overlap with those of mature VRC01-class antibodies, and there was 
statistically significant enrichment for mutations at VRC01-Env contact sites (Figure 5B, C, 
D, Figure S4, S6). As for VRC01 IgL chain, somatic hypermutations appeared primarily 
focused on CDR L1 of IGKV3-20; a pattern that may be significant in that the mature 
VRC01 IgL chain contains deletions in CDR L1 (Figure S5). Some of the abundant 
mutations may reflect intrinsic mutation hotspots of IGVH1-2*02 and substitution bias (for 
example, G31D and M34I), as they also frequently occur in non-HIV-1 antibodies (Figure 
5C). As expected from the poor immune response to BG505, both IGHV1-2*02 IgH chain 
and IGKV3-20*01 IgL chain accumulated minimal levels of mutation upon BG505 
immunization (Figure 5B, C and S4 and 5).
To evaluate binding and neutralization functions of cloned antibodies, we synthesized 27 
pairs of IGHV1-2*02 IgH chain and IGKV3-20*01 IgL chain as recombinant monoclonal 
antibodies (Figure S6). We first tested binding affinities toward various forms of gp120 
(Figure 6). Since these antibodies were selected by eOD-GT6, most showed robust binding 
activity toward three different forms of engineered gp120 outer domain or cores that interact 
with germline VRC01-class antibodies (eOD-GT8, C13, 426c-degly3), and interaction was 
strictly dependent on a functional CD4 binding site (Figure 6; compare eOD-GT8 with 
ΔeOD-GT8, C13 with ΔC13, 426c with Δ426c). Some antibodies were able to bind the 
426c-WT SOSIP trimer; one showed detectable binding to BG505 SOSIP. As a more 
stringent functional test, we performed neutralization assays (Figure 7 and Figure S7). Most 
of these antibodies potently neutralized a virus that lacked three glycosylation sites 
(426c.N276D.N460D.N463D) (Figure 7). Some antibodies exhibited substantial 
neutralization activity against the virus with one glycosylation site mutation (426c.N276D). 
Consistent with heterologous neutralization activity in sera, a few antibodies neutralized the 
45_01dG5 virus, which naturally lacks a glycan at site 276. One antibody, 1538-79, 
exhibited weak neutralization activity of the wild-type 426c virus with all glycans intact; 
correspondingly, the same antibody also bound to BG505 SOSIP. Thus the cloned antibody 
panels largely recapitulated serum binding and neutralization activities (Figure 4E). In 
summary, these studies demonstrated that our stepwise immunization strategy led to

 substantial affinity maturation of the germline VRC01 antibody, such that some elicited 
antibodies recognized more native forms of HIV-1 Env protein.
DISCUSSION
We have generated two types of mouse models: one designed to test immunization strategies 
for engaging B cells expressing VRC01-class precursor B cell receptors, and the other for 
evaluating their affinity maturation. Relative to conventional VRC01 transgenic mouse 
models, a unique aspect of our models is that IGHV1-2*02 is expressed in association with 
highly diverse CDR H3s, thus providing a more physiological repertoire on which to test 
candidate immunogens. In the first mouse model, where only the IGHV1-2*02 IgH chain V 
exon was introduced, immunization with a high affinity germline VRC01 binder activated B 
cells that express IGHV1-2*02 in association with a mouse IgL chains containing a 5-amino 
acid CDR L3, a VRC01-class antibody signature. In the second mouse model where both the 
IGHV1-2*02 IgH chain and an immature VRC01 IgL chain were expressed, stepwise 
immunization induced affinity maturation of the VRC01 precursor, and some affinity 
maturation intermediates exhibited viral neutralization activity. Thus, we have been able to 
start with mice expressing diverse “germline” VRC01 precursors and move B cell 
maturation along a path that results in potent neutralization of viruses that lack the 276 
glycan, and in one case, of a homologous wild-type virus (426c).
There have been three previous reports of immunization studies aimed at eliciting VRC01 
type antibodies in mouse models (Dosenovic et al., 2015; Jardine et al., 2015; McGuire et 
al., 2016). A major difference between our models and earlier models is that IGHV1-2*02 is 
expressed in association with diverse CDR H3’s in our models, whereas IGHV1-2*02 was 
linked to a fixed CDR H3 from mature VRC01-class antibodies in prior models. For mature 
VRC01-class antibodies, the CDR H3 makes a relatively small contribution to the interface 
between VRC01-class antibodies and gp120 (Zhou et al., 2010; 2013; 2015); however, in the 
context of germline IGHV1-2*02, the role of CDR H3 becomes more obvious. In this 
regard, binding affinities of eOD-GT6 and eOD-GT8 toward different germline reverted 
VRC01-class antibodies vary over a broad range (Jardine et al., 2013; Jardine et al., 2016); 
such variation is likely attributable to distinct CDR H3 sequences, as all of these antibodies 
share the same IGHV1-2*02. In the context of germline IGHV1-2*02, CDR2 and 
framework 3 (FW3) region, principal contact sites between mature VRC01-class antibodies 
and gp120, have not been optimized, and contributions from CDR H3 may become relevant.
In the VH1-2/LC immunization mouse model, IGHV1-2*02 is associated with diverse CDR 
H3s, a subset of which may be compatible with high affinity binding to eOD-GT8 60mer 
and, thus, respond to eOD-GT8 60mer immunization. In this regard, it is significant that all 
the cloned antibodies with neutralization activities utilized mouse JH1, which is highly 
homologous to human JH2 and provides the conserved W residue in CDR H3 of VRC01-
class antibodies (Table S5). In a recent study, eOD-GT8 was used to isolate B cells from 
human peripheral blood; strikingly, a substantial fraction of these B cells express antibodies 
composed of IGHV1-2*02 IgH chain and an IgL chain with 5-amino acid CDR L3’s 
(Jardine et al., 2016). Together, these studies demonstrate that, even in the context of 
complex CDR H3, eOD-GT8 60mer is able to effectively engage VRC01 type antibodies,

 and may, therefore, serve as an effective priming antigen for vaccine development. A 
potential complicating factor, which remains to be resolved, is that in response to 
immunization with eOD-GT8 60mer or other germline binders in the context of a complex B 
cell repertoire, antibodies targeting irrelevant epitopes may eventually dominate the immune 
response (McGuire et al., 2014). If this were the case, a potential solution would be to use a 
heterologous Env boost to focus the response to the CD4 binding site. In previous studies, 
expression of pre-rearranged VRC01 IgH chains largely precluded potential interference 
from other IgH chains. In our current study, although IGHV1-2*02 IgH chain represents 
only a fraction of the total repertoire, its frequency is still well above the physiological level, 
and in the case of VH1-2/LC model, the VRC01 light chain was used in nearly all B cells. 
Thus, it remains to be tested whether eOD-GT8 or other germline VRC01 binders elicit 
VRC01 type antibodies when IGHV1-2*02HC and VRC01LC are expressed at 
physiological frequencies.
With substantial progress at the priming stage of inducing VRC01-class antibodies, the next 
major challenge was to mature the VRC01-class precursors to attain broad neutralizing 
activity, and to test such immunogens in the setting of diverse B cell repertoires. None of the 
isolated antibodies from our current immunizations have attained broad neutralizing status, 
and additional boosts with appropriate immunogens will be required to further mature the 
VRC01 intermediates. A major hurdle is N276 glycosylation, which also posed a roadblock 
to the maturation of VRC01 class antibodies in two HIV-1 infected individuals (Kong et al., 
2016; Wu et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2015). Structural studies suggest that overcoming this 
roadblock will require remodeling of the CDR L1 region. In one case of a VRC01-class 
antibody (DRVIA7) that failed to attain broad neutralization (Kong et al, 2016), N276 
appears to clash with CDR L1; the same problem may have hindered further maturation of 
VRC01 type of antibodies in our immunization experiments. In mature VRC01-class 
antibodies, extensive remodeling of CDR L1, including small deletions, established 
favorable contacts with N276. We found that the CDR L1 of IGKV3-20*01 appeared to be a 
SHM hotspot region (Figure S5); however, the prevalent mutations may reflect intrinsic 
hotspot activity rather than antigenic selection, as the mutation patterns are closer to those of 
non-anti-HIV-1 antibodies than to VRC01-class bnAbs (Figure S5). Thus, further progress 
in VRC01 maturation would require additional rounds of SHM coupled with effective 
selection for VRC01 mimetic mutations in CDR L1, including rare deletion events. One 
potential strategy is to generate mouse models that express affinity maturation intermediates 
and devise immunization strategies to improve their neutralization breadth and potency. With 
the use of RDBC, which obviates the need for lengthy and costly mouse breeding, our 
approach will expedite this reiterative process of model building and immunization.
Some broadly neutralizing antibodies are polyreactive for multiple host molecules or 
autoreactive with specific antigens, a property that complicates efforts to generate mouse 
models for broadly neutralizing antibodies (Haynes and Verkoczy, 2014; Liu et al., 2015). In 
a previously published model of VRC01, which expresses both pre-rearranged IgH and IgL 
chains of germline 3BNC60, the IgL chain was deleted via receptor editing from the 
majority of B cells (McGuire et al., 2016). The remaining B cells expressing the germline 
3BNC60 HC and LC appeared to take on a marginal zone B cell phenotype. In our 
VH1-2/LC model, the introduced precursor VRC01LC dominates the peripheral B cell

 repertoire, with no evidence of receptor editing. Comparing the two mouse models, 
identities of IgL chains are different: the IgL chain in our current study is composed of 
germline IGKV3-20 joined to a mature CDR L3 involving Jκ1; the IgL chain in the prior 
study consists of germline IGKV1-33*01 joined to Jκ3*01. Thus, the different fate of the 
light chains in the two mouse models might reflect their distinct sequences. Alternatively, 
the diverse CDR H3’s of IGHV1-2*02 IgH chains in our model may enable the selection for 
IgH and IgL chain pairs that are compatible with normal B cell maturation. It will be of 
interest to apply our de novo recombination strategy to the expression of other broadly 
neutralizing antibodies and test whether our approach could alleviate negative selection 
against certain polyreactive or autoreactive antibodies.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Mice—The VH1-2 and VH1-2/LC mouse models were generated and housed in the animal 
facility at Boston Children’s Hospital. The animal work was covered under protocol 
14-10-2790R, which was approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of 
Boston Children’s Hospital. The VH1-2 mouse model was derived from a F1 hybrid 
(129/Sv: C57BL/6) ES clone in which human IGHV1-2*02 replaced the mouse VH81X, and 
IGCRI was deleted on the IgHa allele (129/Sv) (See text and METHODS DETAILS). The 
ES clone was injected into Rag2−/− blastocysts to generate RDBC chimeras. The chimeric 
mice were bred with 129/Sv mice for germline transmission of the targeted mutations. 
Heterozygous VH1-2/IGCRI mice were bred to homozygosity (VH1-2 mouse model). In 
VH1-2 mouse model, both IgH alleles are of IgHa allotype (129/Sv), but the other 
chromosomes are of mixed 129/Sv and C57BL/6 origins. The VH1-2/LC mouse model was 
derived from the F1 ES clone described above that contained the VH1-2 replacement and 
IGCRI deletion by further gene targeted replacement of the mouse Jκ locus with the 
precursor VRC01 light chain and targeted deletion of the JHb allele (See text and 
METHODS DETAILS). The resultant ES clone was injected into Rag2−/− blastocysts to 
generate chimeric mice (VH1-2/LC mouse model), which are of mixed 129/Sv and C57BL/6 
genetic background.
For immunization studies, the VH1-2 and VH1-2/LC mice were housed and cared for in 
accordance with local, state, federal, and institute policies in an American Association for 
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care-accredited facility at the NIH. All animal 
experiments were reviewed and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the 
Vaccine Research Center, NIAID, NIH. The animal work was covered under protocol VRC 
14-467 for breeding, and VRC 14-480 for immunization of mice.

 METHODS DETAILS
Generation and characterization of VH1-2 and VH1-2/LC mouse models—All the 
genetic modifications were introduced into ES cells, using standard gene targeting 
technology (e.g. Chen et al., 1993; Guo et al., 2011). To illustrate the method of genetic 
modification, the replacement of VH81X with IGHV1-2*02 is described here as an example; 
all the other genetic modifications followed the same procedure. The targeting construct was 
based on PGKneolox2DTA.2 (Addgene #13449). In this targeting construct, the 
IGHV1-2*02 segment, from the start codon in leader exon to the end of VH exon, is flanked 
with homology arms for the VH81X locus. The 5′ homology arm is 3.2kb long and 
corresponds to the sequences upstream of the start codon of VH81X coding region; the 3′ 
homology arm is 5.3kb long and corresponds to the sequences downstream of the VH81X 
VH exon. A neomycin resistance gene situates between the IGHV1-2*02 segment and the 3′ 
homology arm to serve as the positive selection marker for transfection; the neomycin 
selection marker is flanked with two loxP sites to effect the removal of the drug selection 
marker subsequent to the identification of the correctly targeted clones. The deletion of the 
drug selection marker is necessary to avoid any potential interference on local transcriptional 
activity. The vector also contains a DTA gene as a negative selection marker to minimize 
random integration events. The targeting constructs for the other genetic modifications were 
configured in a similar manner as described above. For IGCRI and JHb deletion, no 
extraneous sequences other than those from cloning vectors were introduced in between the 
homology arms. For expression of the precursor VRC01 light chain, a 1.5kb fragment 
upstream of mouse IGKV3-1 gene segment was joined directly to the start codon of human 
IGKV3-20*01 and served as the promoter for transcription of the rearranged Igκ light chain 
gene. The whole cassette, promoter plus VRC01 light chain, was flanked with 5′ and 3′ 
homology arms and neomycin selection marker in the targeting construct.
All the genetic modifications were carried out in EF1 ES cell line, which was derived from a 
F1 hybrid mouse (129/Sv:C57BL/6). The cells were cultured at 37°C with 5% CO2 in 
DMEM medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 20mM HEPES, 1x MEM 
nonessential amino acids, 2mM Glutamine, 100 units of Penicillin/Streptomycin, 100μM β-
mercaptoethanol, 500 units/ml Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF). The ES cells were grown 
on a monolayer of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) that have been mitotically 
inactivated with γ-irradiation. For transfection, 40μg of targeting construct was linearized 
via a restriction digest and electroporated into 2×107 EF1 cells. Stable transfectants were 
selected with 0.4mg/ml of G418. 6–7 days after transfection, colonies were picked into 24 
well plates that have been coated with MEF. After 3 days, half of the colonies were frozen at 
−80°C and the other half were expanded for DNA isolation. The genomic DNA was 
analyzed with Southern blotting to identify clones in which the desired genetic modifications 
have taken place. After the primary screen, positive clones were further validated via 
additional Southern blotting analyses, and the modified region was amplified by PCR and 
sequenced. After a clone has passed all these tests, it was treated with Adeno-cre virus; 
expression of cre recombinase led to the deletion of the neomycin drug selection marker 
through flanking loxP sites. After the cre treatment, cells were subcloned and individual 
clones were screened as above via Southern blotting analyses to identify clones from which 
the drug selection marker has been eliminated. The correct clones were karyotyped, and

 clones with a normal karyotype were used for injection into Rag2−/− blastocysts. 3 weeks 
after the pups were born, blood samples were collected from the mice and stained with anti-
B220, anti-IgM, and anti-Thy1.2 antibodies. Mice with good reconstitution of B and T cells 
in peripheral blood were used directly for immunization experiments (VH1-2/LC mouse 
model) or for breeding (VH1-2 mouse model). For germline transmission, chimeric VH1-2 
mice were bred with 129/Sv mice and the progenies were screened for transmission of 
IGHV1-2*02 replacement and IGCRI deletion. Heterozygous IGHV1-2*02/ΔIGCRI mice 
were inter-bred to produce homozygous mice, which were used as the VH1-2 model in the 
immunization experiments.
To characterize B cells in VH1-2 and the VH1-2/LC mouse models, splenocytes were 
isolated from 5–8 weeks old mice, and splenocytes from 129/Sv mice of similar age were 
used as controls. The splenocytes were treated with red blood cell lysis buffer and stained 
with the following antibodies: PE-Cy5 anti-B220 (eBioscience 15-0452-83); PE anti-Thy1.2 
(PharMingen 553006); PE anti-IgM (eBioscience 12-5790-83); PE anti-Igλ (BioLegend 
407308); FITC anti-Igκ (SoutnernBiotech 1050-02); FITC anti-IgD (PharMingen 553439).
HTGTS-rep-seq analysis of B cell repertoire—2–4μg of DNA from purified splenic 
B cells was used for generating HTGTS-rep-seq libraries following published procedures 
(Hu et al., 2016). For analyzing IgH repertoire, two nested primers downstream of JH2 were 
used: 5′-BiosG/CTCCCAATGACCCTTTCTGAC-3′, 5′-
GTCCCTAGTCCTTCATGACCTG-3′. Repertoire analysis with primers downstream of 
JH1, JH3 and JH4 gave very similar results and conclusions, and were not shown in this 
paper due to space limitations. The sequence reads from each JH library has been deposited 
in NCBI data base (see DATA AND SOFTWARE AVAILABILITY) and are available to 
the reader. Because different JH primers differ in priming efficiencies during library 
construction, the most accurate view of the overall pattern of VH usage for the four JHs is 
obtained by analyzing each individually as opposed to pooling primers to generate combined 
repertoire profiles (e.g. Lin et al., 2016). For analyzing Igκ repertoires, two nested primers 
downstream of Jκ5 were used: 5′-BiosG/GCCCCTAATCTCACTAGCTTGA-3′, 5′-
GTCAACTGATAATGAGCCCTCTCC-3′. Since the Igκ locus in VH1-2 mouse is 
unaltered, the Igκ repertoire in this mouse model is expected to be essentially identical to 
that of a normal mouse, which was confirmed via comparison of Igκ repertoire from all four 
Jκ primers of the VH1-2 mouse with that of normal mice previously described (Lin et al., 
2016). All libraries were sequenced via MiSeq and analyzed with the HTGTS-Rep-seq 
pipeline (Lin et al., 2016).
Single cell RT-PCR—Splenocytes were treated with red blood cell lysis buffer and stained 
with PE-Cy5 anti-B220 (eBioscience 15-0452-83), PE anti-IgM (eBioscience 12-5790-83), 
and FITC anti-IgD (PharMingen 553439) antibodies. Single B220+IgM+IgDhi cells were 
sorted into 96-well plates; each well of the plate contains 5μl of lysis buffer (10mM Tris.Cl 
pH7.6, 100ng yeast tRNA, 2 units of SUPERasein, 0.5% NP40). After sorting, the plate was 
heated at 95°C for 3 minutes and chilled to 10°C. To each well was added 5μl of reaction 
mix containing: 2x First strand buffer, 10mM DTT, 1mM dNTP, 2 units of SUPERasein, 10 
units of Superscript III, 5pmol of oligo(dT). The reaction was incubated at 50°C for 1 hour.

 Following the reverse transcription reaction, 3μl of the cDNA was added to 7μl of PCR 
reaction mix so that the final reaction contains: 1xCoral Red PCR buffer, 0.5 units of Taq 
polymerase, 0.2mM dNTP, 10pmol of 5′ IGKV3-20*01 primer (5′-TTC CTC CTG CTA 
CTC TGG CT-3′) and 3′ Cκ primer (5′-GCC TCA CAG GTA TAG CTG TT-3′). The PCR 
program was 94°C 30 seconds, 65°C 1 minute, 72°C 1 minute, 35 cycles, 72°C 5 minutes. 
After the first round of PCR, 1μl of the PCR product was added to 9μl of second PCR 
reaction mix so that the final reaction contains: 1xCoral Red PCR buffer, 0.5 units of Taq 
polymerase, 0.2mM dNTP, 10pmol 5′ IGKV3-20*01 primer and nested 3′ Cκ primer (5′-
GGA CGC CAT TTT GTC GTT CA-3′). PCR program was the same as the first round of 
PCR. PCR products were run on agarose gels; PCR products were excised from the gels and 
sequenced to confirm their identity.
Immunizations—For each immunization, 100 μl of immunogen mix, containing 15–60 μg 
of specified, filter-sterilized protein immunogen and 60 μg of poly I:C in PBS, was injected 
to the inner thigh of the two rear legs of each mouse. The VH1-2 mice were immunized only 
once, and blood was collected 2 weeks after the immunization. Spleens were collected two 
to seven weeks later. The VH1-2/LC mice were immunized monthly for 6 times. Two weeks 
after each injection, blood from all animals was collected for serological analyses, and one 
animal may be sacrificed for spleen collection. Blood and spleen from a naïve mouse were 
also collected as reference.

HHHHHH. The sequence of C13 chimeric gp120 core is underlined. The truncated V1V2 
loop, the D loop, the truncated V3 loop, and the V5 loop are labeled in parentheses, 
sequentially. D279, which knocks out the CD4bs when mutated to K, is in bold. The N-
terminal signal peptide is in bold. The avidin-HRV3c-6xHis tag is at the C-terminus. The 
nucleotide sequence of C13 is available from GeneBank: KX462845.
Antibody sequences—The sequences of the cloned antibodies from immunized VH1-2 
and VH1-2/LC mice have been deposited in GeneBank; their accession numbers are listed in 
the KEY RESOURCES TABLE.
Protein production—All proteins were produced in transiently transfected Expi293 or 
293F cells as previously described (Pancera et al., 2014). The immunogens, eOD-
GT6_60mer (lumazine synthase nanoparticle), eOD-GT8_60mer, 426c-degly3 (N276D, 
N460D, N463D) core-Ferritin, 426c-degly2 (N276D, N460D) core, 426c-degly1 (N276D) 
core and 426c-WT gp120 core, were purified with Galanthus nivalis (GNA)-lectin gel (EY 
Laboratories, Inc.) and followed with a gel filtration chromatography. The BG505.SOSIP 
trimer and the 426c-WT.SOSIP trimer were purified with the 2G12/SEC method as 
previously described (Pancera et al., 2014). For ELISA and sorting probes, avi-his-tagged 
eOD-GT6, eOD-GT8, 426-degly3 core, C13 gp120 core, a VRC-developed VRC01-
germline-binding UG037.8-based chimeric gp120 core, and their corresponding CD4bs-KO 
(Δ) mutants, ΔeOD-GT6 (D279K/D368V), ΔeOD-GT8 (D279K/D368R), Δ426-degly3 core 
(D279K/D368R) and ΔC13 (D279K), were purified with Ni-NTA beads (GE healthcare) and 
followed by a gel filtration chromatography for monomeric proteins. For antibody 
production, heavy and light chain plasmids were co-transfected (1:1 ratio) in Expi293 cells 
using Expi293fectin (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The supernatants 
were harvested six days later, and the IgG was purified using protein G Sepharose (GE

 Healthcare) and buffer-exchanged into PBS (0.01 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.137 M 
sodium chloride).
ELISA—Corning Costar® half-area assay plates were coated with antigens at 100 ng/well 
at 4°C overnight, blocked with either B3T buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM 
EDTA, 3.3% fetal bovine serum, 2% bovine albumin, 0.07% Tween 20, 0.02% thimerosal) 
for mouse sera or 1:10 diluted blocking solution (Immune Technology Corp.) for purified 
mAbs at room temperature for 1 hr, and incubated with serial diluted sera or antibodies at 
room temperature for 1 hr. The plates were then washed with PBS with 0.05% Tween 
(Sigma) 5 times, and 1:5,000 diluted HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies, goat anti-
human IgG and/or goat-anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad) were added. The plates were washed 
again and the SureBlue™ TMB Microwell Peroxidase Substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry 
Laboratories, Inc.) was added to each well. The color reaction was terminated with 1N 
sulfuric acid and the absorbance at 450 nm (OD450) was recorded. Background absorbance 
was determined based on wells blotted with a non-related primary antibody and endpoint 
titer was determined as the largest serum dilution or the lowest primary antibody 
concentration at which the OD450 is three times over the background level.
TZM-bl Neutralization Assay—Single round replication Env-pseudoviruses were 
prepared, titered and used for infecting TZM-bl target cells in the presence of different 
concentrations of mouse sera or purified monoclonal antibodies as described previously (Wu 
et al., 2010). The neutralizing titer was reported as half-maximum inhibitory concentration 
(IC50) or 80%-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC80) in μg/ml for mAbs and half-
maximum inhibitory dilution (ID50 or ID80) for mouse sera.
Flow cytometry and B-cell sorting—Mouse spleen samples were processed for single 
B cell sorting based on previously described methods (Tiller et al., 2009). In brief, single cell 
suspension of splenocytes was stained sequentially with ViVid and a staining mix containing 
anti-CD3 Cy55PerCP, anti-CD4 Cy55PerCP, anti-CD8 Cy55PerCP, anti-F4/80 Cy55PerCP, 
anti-B220 TrPE, anti-IgD BV711, anti-IgM Cy7PE, anti-IgG FITC, eOD-GT6(8)-PE and 
ΔeOD-GT6(8)-APC. Memory B cells were selected for the phenotype B220+, CD3−, CD4−, 
CD8−, F4/80−, IgM−, IgD−, and IgG+. To make antigen-specific probes, 50 nM of 
biotinylated Avi-tagged eOD-GT6(8) monomer and its CD4bs-KO variant ΔeOD-GT6(8) 
(D279K, D368V/R) were coupled to Streptavidin-PE and Streptavidin-APC (Life 
Technologoies), respectively, in equal molar ratios. Memory B cells with eOD-GT6(8)-PE+ 
ΔeOD-GT6(8)-APC− were selected and single-cell sorted into 96 well plates containing lysis 
buffer on a BD FACSAria III sorter and immediately stored at −80°C. Spleen samples 
without eOD-GT6(8) and ΔeOD-GT6(8) probes and spleen samples from naïve littermates 
were used as controls and to set up the gate for sorting.
Single B-cell RT-PCR, gene amplification, and cloning—Reverse transcription and 
subsequent PCR amplification of heavy and light chain variable genes were performed using 
SuperScript III (Life Technologies) as previously described (Tiller et al., 2009; Wu et al., 
2010). All PCR reactions were performed in 25 μl volume with 1–2.5 μl of cDNA transcript 
using HotStar Taq DNA polymerase master mix (Qiagen). For the VH1-2 single knock-in

 mice, mixtures of previously described mouse Ig primers (Tiller et al., 2009) were 
supplemented with human VH1-2 specific primers for 1st and 2nd PCR (Table S6). For the 
double knock-in mice, specific VH1-2 and VK3-20 5′ primers in combination with 
designed 3′ primers aligning to the 5′ regions of the mouse gamma (1, 2a, 2b, 2b and 3), 
mu, or kappa constant segments (Table S6) were used for nested PCR to amplify VH1-2 and 
VK3-20 heavy and light chains. PCR products were then sequenced using Sanger 
sequencing and corrected for PCR errors before further analysis and expression. The 
confirmed heavy or light chain sequences containing the whole V(D)J or VJ segments were 
synthesized by GenScript and cloned into a mouse IgG1- or mouse Kappa-mammalian 
expression vector for antibody expression.
Bio-Layer Interferometry Antigenicity Analysis—Kinetics and affinities of antibody-
antigen interactions were measured on an Octet.HTX (Forte Bio) using Anti-human IgG Fc 
and Anti-mouse IgG Fc capture biosensors following the instructions. Briefly, purified 
VRC01, VRC01gl, and synthesized mouse antibodies were loaded (50 μg/ml) on anti-human 
or anti-mouse IgG Fc biosensors (AHC, AMC, ForteBio). Following a 1% BSA/PBS buffer 
wash step, eOD-GT8 or ΔeOD-GT8 monomer at 6 different concentrations was associated 
(2-fold dilutions starting at 5uM) and then allowed to dissociate into 1%BSA/PBS buffer. A 
1:1 ratio of antibody to antigen was assumed for the complex to calculate molar 
concentration and an irrelevant anti-Influenza antibody was used as a negative control in all 
experiments. Reference wells containing anti-influenza antibody were subtracted from 
samples wells. All experiments were performed at 30°C. Octet Analysis Software was used 
for data analysis, curve fitting and determination of Kd, Kon and Koff. We deemed that no fit 
was observed if fewer than 3 curves could be fit with an R2 ≥ 0.95.
Mutation profile construction and statistical test for enriched and depleted 
mutations—The mutation frequency of IGHV1-2 and IGKV3-20 were estimated from 
1080 and 4598 antibody clones from three normal donors (Bonsignori et al., 2016). From 
each clone, one sequence was randomly selected. For enrichment and depletion test, we 
randomly selected the same number of sequences (equal to the number observed at each 
time point of vaccination study) from the non-HIV neutralizing IGHV1-2 or IGKV3-20 
antibody repertoire for 1000 times. Then the mean occurrence and standard deviations for 
each mutation was calculated and 95% confidence interval (CI) were decided. Mutations 
with frequency higher than 95% CI were counted as enriched mutations, and those with 
frequency lower than 95% CI were counted as depleted mutations. Sequences were aligned 
using MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004). Consensus sequences for the broadly neutralizing antibody 
lineages were inferred using SeaView (Gouy et al., 2010).
High-throughput paired heavy-light chain RT-PCR—Splenic mouse B cells were 
isolated using magnetic bead depletion (EasySep™ Mouse Pan-B Cell Isolation Kit, 
Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver, CA) and analyzed with a single-cell flow focusing 
emulsion technology to link paired heavy and light chain antibody genes for high-throughput 
DNA sequencing (DeKosky et al., 2015). Briefly, paired heavy- and light-chain sequencing 
was achieved via single-cell isolation in emulsion droplets, cell lysis, and mRNA capture, 
overlap extension RT-PCR to link heavy and light chains, and Illumina MiSeq sequencing of

 the VH:VL cDNA product (RT-PCR kit: SuperScript® III One-Step RT-PCR System with 
Platinum® Taq DNA Polymerase, Invitrogen/Thermo Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA). 
Emulsion linkage RT-PCR primers are provided in Table S7 upper panel, and nested PCR 
primers are provided in Table S7 lower panel. Paired-end Illumina sequences were quality-
filtered to a Q-score of 20 over 50% of the sequence read and annotated using the National 
Center for Biotechnology Information IgBLAST platform combined with a CDR3 motif 
identification algorithm (bioinformatic methods/code reported in (DeKosky et al., 2016)). A 
new IgBLAST V-gene library was used for this analysis containing all IMGT mouse and 
human VH and Vκ,λ genes; J- and D-gene libraries contained only mouse sequences. 
Antibody constant region isotype (G/A/M/K/L) was assigned using the nested PCR primer 
sequences that target the constant region.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
For statistical comparison of two individual groups, a Student’s t-Test was performed with 
two tailed distributions and equal variance. For comparison of the mutation frequencies at 
multiple time points, ANOVA Kruskal-Wallis test was performed using GraphPad Prism 
6.05 Software (GraphPad Prism Software, Inc.).

 Figure 1. Generation and characterization of VH1-2 mouse model
(A) Illustration of genetic modifications in the VH1-2 mouse mode (see text, Figure S1A and 
S1B for details). (B) Illustration of Rag2 deficient blastocyst complementation (See text for 
details). (C) HTGTS-rep-seq analysis of VH usage in VH1-2 mouse model and in control 
129/Sv mouse. The X-axis represents VH locus from the distal to the D-proximal ends; a 
subset of mouse VHs are labeled for comparison between 129/Sv control and VH1-2 mice. 
The histogram displays the percent usage of each VH of all productive VH(D)JH 
rearrangements. Data for the VH1-2 mouse model were average of three experiments with 
error bars representing standard deviations; data for control 129/Sv mouse is consistent with 
prior studies (Lin et al. 2016). (D) Pie chart Illustration of D segment usage in productive 
IGHV1-2*02 rearrangements in VH1-2 mouse model, average D usage frequency with 
standard deviation for three biological repeats is shown in adjacent panel. (E) Length 
distribution of IGHV1-2*02 CDR H3 in VH1-2 mouse model derived from data in (C). The 
number of total reads and unique reads for IGHV1-2*02 associated CDR H3’s are shown 
and Venn diagram, which reveals tremendous CDR3 complexity since there is little overlap 
in CDR H3 sequences in three technical repeats of a single B cell sample (see Lin et al. 
2016). (F) Length distribution of CDR L3 of mouse IgL chains in VH1-2 mice based on 
three biological replicates with error bars displayed and frequency of 5-amino acid CDR L3 
indicated. Other details are in Methods.

 Figure 3. Generation and characterization of VH1-2/LC model
(A) Illustration of genetic modifications involved in the VH1-2/LC model. See text, Figure 
S3A and S3B for details. (B) HTGTS-rep-seq analysis of VH usage in splenic B cells from 
VH1-2/LC mice performed as in Fig. 1C. (C) D segment usage in productive IGHV1-2*02 
rearrangements in VH1-2/LC mouse model. (D) Length distribution of IGHV1-2*02-
associated CDR H3s in VH1-2/LC mouse model. (E) Single cell analysis of VRC01 IgL 
chain expression in splenic B cells of VH1-2/LC mouse model. Primers for VRC01LC 
cDNA in the leader exon (L) of IGKV3-20*01 and the Cκ exon are represented by arrows. 
Gel images are representative of results from two different VH1-2/LC mice. Numbers of 
VRC01LC+ and VRC01LC− cells are indicated on the pie chart. Other details are in 
Experimental Methods.

antibodies with neutralizing activity
(A) Immunization Schema. (B) Characterization of immunogens (varied symbols) for 
ELISA binding to VRC01 and its germline reverted variant (VRC01gl). (C) ELISA endpoint 
titers of post-immune sera to three germline-binding VRC01-class probes and their 
respective CD4bs-knock out (Δ) mutants. Error bars indicate standard deviations. (D) 
Splenocytes were sorted with eOD-GT6 and ΔeOD-GT6 probes to isolate CD4bs-specific 
IgG+ B cells. (E) Neutralizing activity of post-immune sera to various HIV-1 Env-
pseudoviruses (ID50 titers). n.d., not determined.

 Figure 5. Stepwise immunization of VH1-2/LC mice elicited VRC01-class CD4 binding site-
specific antibodies with increased SHM
(A) Nucleotide mutation frequency in paired VH1-2 and VK3-20 genes, derived from 
CD4bs-specific IgG+ B cells of the BG505-immunized mice (G1) and stepwise-immunized 
mice (G2). Each dot represents one VH1-2 or VK3-20 chain in a VH1-2/VK3-20 paired 
antibody (n, number of VH1-2/VK3-20 pairs in each animal at indicated time points). The 
median with interquartile range is plotted. (B) Numbers of total, VRC01-class mimicking, 
Env-contacting, and both mimicking and contacting amino acid mutations in each VH1-2 
HC amplified from specified mice plotted with median and interquartile range and 
statistically assessed using an unpaired t-tests. VRC01-class mimicking mutations are 
present in at least two of 9 published VRC01-class bnAb lineages. Env-contacting sites are 
based on VRC01-gp120 or gp160 crystal structures. (C) Amino acid mutations in all VH1-2 
HCs from each specified mouse shown in sequence logo profiles. “n” is the number of all 
VH1-2 chains amplified from each animal. For reference, 9 published VRC01-class HC 
lineages are represented below panel G2. VRC01-envelope contact sites are highlighted in 
pink. The mutation profile of IGHV1-2 constructed from 1080 non-HIV-1 neutralizing 
antibody lineages (from three healthy donors) is also shown. The red asterisk marks 
significantly enriched S54R mutations in the G2:wk22 sample. (D) Enriched and depleted 
amino acid substitutions in VH1-2 cloned from the sequential immunization group G2 
compared to non-HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies. The calculated mean occurrence and 
standard deviations of each mutation and 95% CI are depicted in black. The frequency of 
enriched (red diamond) or depleted (blue diamond) mutations locates outside of the 
calculated 95% CI.
