Abstract
Background: Despite achievement of universal health coverage in Thailand, socioeconomic inequality in health has
been a major policy concern. This study examined mortality patterns across different socioeconomic strata in
Thailand.
Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the 2010 Population and Housing Census on area-level
socioeconomic deprivation against the 2010 mortality from the vital registration database at the super-district level.
We used principal components analysis to construct a socioeconomic deprivation index and K-mean cluster analysis
to group socioeconomic status and cause-specific mortality.
Results: Excess mortality rates from all diseases, except colorectal cancer, were observed among super-districts with
low socioeconomic status. Spatial clustering was evident in the distribution of socioeconomic status and mortality
rates. Cluster analysis revealed that super-districts which were predominantly urban tended to have low all-cause
standardize mortality ratio but a high colorectal cancer-specific mortality rate. Deaths due to liver cancer, diabetes,
and renal diseases were common in the low socioeconomic super-districts which hosted one third of the total Thai
population.
Conclusion: Socially deprived areas have an excess of overall and cause specific deaths. Populations living in more
affluent areas, despite low general mortality, still have many preventable deaths such as colorectal cancer. These
findings warrant future epidemiological studies investigating various causes of excessive deaths in non-deprived
areas and implementation of policies to reduce the mortality gap between rich and poor areas.
Keywords: Socioeconomic status, Mortality, Health inequality, Thailand
Background
Socioeconomic inequality among different regions has
been rising in Thailand and in other countries [1, 2].
Apart from socioeconomic disparities, geographical vari-
ations in all causes and cause-specific mortality rates
also exist in Thailand [3]. Previous studies revealed high
mortality rates in the northern region but high mortality
rates due to liver cancer and diabetes in the northeastern
region [4]. Bangkok metropolitan area is known to have
a low overall mortality rate compared to other regions,
but a high rate due to cardiovascular diseases.
Socioeconomic status at the geographical levels has been
identified as a major determinant of health in a population
[5]. The socioeconomic characteristics of an area influences
the health of a population through various mechanisms
such as physical characteristics, for example availability of
goods and services and environmental pollutants, and so-
cial characteristics, for example societal cohesion, collective
efficacy (reflecting the ability of members of a community
to control the behavior of individuals or groups in the

 community ensuring safety and security) and social support
to cope with stress [6].
Socioeconomically disadvantaged areas contribute to
higher mortality than the more advantaged areas [7–10].
To date, most of the evidence on neighborhood socio-
economic inequalities in health has been reported from
high income countries. This issue remains largely unex-
plored in low and middle income countries.
Studies of investigating geographical and socioeconomic
determinants of health have often applied an area-level
deprivation index which is constructed by combining sev-
eral parameters such as education, income, and various
other demographic characteristics [5]. Principal compo-
nent analysis (PCA) is commonly used to construct
deprivation index. This deprivation index can be then
used to correlate with health outcomes such as mortality
rates.
However, the use of PCA sometimes generates am-
biguity due to its over-simplifications [11, 12]. The
use of such aggregate measures cannot identify the
distinct characteristics attributable to specific geo-
graphical areas that can often explain the variations
in cause-specific mortality rates. A more complete
understanding of mortality patterns by geographical
and socioeconomic characteristics should contribute
to better planning and equitable resource allocation
for different areas.
Cluster analysis is another statistical method which
can be used to improve our understanding of the health
and socioeconomic situation of a population by sum-
marizing the main patterns across a wide range of vari-
ables. Using this approach, the main patterns can be
summarized into a series of groups or areas, which can
subsequently be classified by their mortality pattern and
socioeconomic type [13].
Choropleth maps can be used to display the geograph-
ical distribution of measurements of a population such
as mortality rate and socioeconomic status. Together
with cross-tabulation of mortality rate and socioeco-
nomic status, the map can allow a visualization of the
association between the two variables on a spatial di-
mension, which can then provide evidence for policy
makers to invest more in health services to the most dis-
advantaged regions as well as specific health interven-
tions to reduce cause specific mortality. Such a map will
facilitate better targeting of health interventions and re-
source
investments
[14].
This
study
examined
the
deprivation and cause-specific mortality, mortality clus-
tering, socioeconomic clustering and correlation be-
tween mortality clusters and socioeconomic clusters in
Thailand.
Methods
A cross-sectional analysis of two datasets was con-
ducted; the 2010 Census of Population and Housing
conducted by the National Statistical Office and mortal-
ity records from the Civil Registration and Vital Statis-
tics in 2010. A flowchart of the methodology is shown in
Fig. 1, which describes the process of analysis of these
two datasets. From the flow chart, four main findings
emerge:
cause
specific
standardized
mortality
ratio
(SMR) by deprivation index at the super-district level,
mortality clusters, geographical socioeconomic clusters,
and a tabulation between geographical socioeconomic
and mortality clusters.
Unit of analysis
In 2010, Thailand was classified as a lower middle-income
country with a population of 63 million. There were 77
provinces and 928 administrative districts. The population

 of these districts varied substantially, ranging from a mini-
mum of 2253 to a maximum of 492,490. The significant
variation in population size of the districts violates the as-
sumption of equal variance within each unit. To alleviate
this violation, we aggregated adjacent districts, thus sys-
tematically created what we call super-districts. These
super-districts have less variation in population size, thus
the mortality rates in areas in these are relatively more
stable. A detailed explanation for deriving super-districts
is described elsewhere [4]. The 928 administrative districts
were aggregated into 331 super-districts, with a median
population of 189,067 persons and ranging from 100,970
to 492,490. These super-district units were used through-
out the analysis.
Data sources
Mortality data
Population mortality data in 2010 were obtained from
the national vital registration system, responsible by the
Ministry of Interior, Bureau of Registration Administra-
tion. Each record includes date of birth and date, cause
and place of death. The description of the cause of death
was coded by the Bureau of Policy and Strategy, Ministry
of Public Health using the International Classification of
Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10). Individual mortality
was credited to each super-district according to regis-
tered place of residence of the deceased. The leading
cause of death was categorized by the condensed ICD-
10 mortality tabulation list 1, which contains 103 causes
of death [15]. We selected the 31 most common causes
of death based on mortality in the general population,
which covered 95% of all deaths in 2010.
Standardized mortality ratios were calculated to com-
pare mortality across super-districts. The numbers of
deaths expected in each super-district was calculated by
taking the reference from the mortality rates of Thailand
for the year 2010, by sex, age and cause of death.
Mid-year population data in 2010 was obtained from
the Bureau of Registration Administration, Ministry of
Interior. The SMR was the main measure of mortality
in all subsequent analyses.
Socioeconomic data
A random weighted sample of 20% of the 2010 Census
of Population and Housing database was obtained from
the National Statistics Office, which was the maximum
proportion that the research team was allowed to access.
This proportion was deemed adequate for the analysis at
the super-district level. The census includes the following
variables at the household and individual levels: demo-
graphic characteristics such as age, gender, nationality,
marital status, education level and literacy, occupation
and work status, migration characteristics and duration of
living in the house, characteristic and tenure of dwelling,
and ownership of durable appliances [16]. Income and
expenditure information are not included in the Thai
census.
Based on previous studies on important socioeco-
nomic indicators which contribute to the construction
of the deprivation index [17–28] and availability of the
data, we identified 18 socio-demographic variables in the
census, listed in Table 1, to construct the deprivation
index. Similar to the mortality data, socioeconomic data
of individuals and households were aggregated to obtain
the proportion of individuals and households at the
super-district level. Each aggregated variable was stan-
dardized into a z-score and used in the principle compo-
nent analysis and cluster analysis.
Statistical analysis
Principle component analysis
Principal component analysis (PCA) is a data reduction
technique frequently used to create socio-demographic
scales or indices [29, 30]. In constructing the deprivation
index, 18 socioeconomic variables were reduced into a
single factor using varimax rotation. Factor scores from
the first principal component was designated as the
deprivation index. Higher scores correspond to higher
levels of deprivation. Super-districts were then classified
into quintiles according to their deprivation index. A
choropleth map was created to visualize the geographical
distribution of socioeconomic deprivation by quintile.
PROC FACTOR procedures in SAS version 9.4 was used
to conduct the PCA.
Analysis of socioeconomic gradient and cause-specific
mortality
To examine the effect of simplified socioeconomic gradi-
ent on mortality, the cause-specific SMR between the
two extremes - the top quintile (Q5: most deprived) and
the bottom quintile (Q1: least deprived) - were com-
pared to reflect the effect of socioeconomic gradient on
cause-specific mortality. Note that this is unlike wealth
index quintiles where Q1 represents the poorest group
and Q5 represents the richest.
Cluster analysis
This study adopted the K-means clustering method to
separately group super-districts based on socioeconomic
status and mortality rate. K-means clustering is a
well-known and widely used technique due to its sim-
plicity, robustness, and efficiency when using large
datasets [31]. It classifies observations into clusters in
which each observation belongs to the cluster with
the nearest mean.
The procedure begins with the construction of initial
cluster centers. Each super-district is individually relo-
cated to the cluster center that they are located nearest
Aungkulanon et al. International Journal for Equity in Health  (2017) 16:117 
Page 3 of 12
 to and then the relocation is assessed to see if it im-
proves the model. Observations are then reassigned
until no further improvements can be gained. The
cluster algorithm is repeated for all values of k in the
range 1 to 9, where k represents the number of clus-
ters. The appropriate number of clusters was chosen
based the following criteria: 1) generating interpret-
able clustering patterns; 2) having neither too few nor
too many small clusters; and 3) assessing an elbow
plot of the overall R2 which can help to determine
when a further increase in the number of clusters
would result in a relatively little increase in R2. PROC
FASTCLUS procedures in SAS version 9.4 was used
to conduct the cluster analysis. A choropleth map of
Thailand was created to visualize the geographical
patterns of mortality and socioeconomic status across
all super-districts of Thailand.
Association between socioeconomic status and mortality
Fisher’s exact test was used to assess the association be-
tween socioeconomic patterns and mortality clusters.
Results
Deprivation index and cause-specific mortality
The first principal component explained 40.8% of the
total variation in socioeconomic status. This was desig-
nate as the deprivation index. A map of super-districts
showing variation in the social deprivation gradient is
displayed in Fig. 2 with darker hue indicating higher so-
cial deprivation. The most deprived areas were mainly
located in the northern region and some parts of the
northeastern and central regions. Greater Bangkok was
the least deprived area.
Table 2 compares cause-specific SMR of Q1 (least de-
prived super-districts) and Q5 (most deprived super-
districts) by the top 31 causes of mortality. The last column
(the extreme ratio between Q5 and Q1) indicates the level
of inequality in cause specific mortality between the most
and least deprived super-districts.
Cause of death with Q5/Q1 ratios greater than unity
suggests a higher risk of death among the deprived com-
pared to the non-deprived super-districts. Of the 31
leading causes of deaths, eight: unspecified causes, liver

 and bile duct cancer, traffic injuries, renal diseases, re-
mainder of diseases of the digestive system, drowning,
remainder of diseases of the nervous system, and self-
harm, had Q5/Q1 ratios greater than 1.5. Perinatal disor-
ders and colorectal cancer had Q5/Q1 ratios less than
0.66. Ischemic heart disease had higher SMR among the
most affluent super-districts.
Mortality clustering
Selecting the number of clusters
The elbow plot of R2 by number of clusters shown in
Additional file 1: did not exhibit a very strong elbow. The
line started to plateau after five clusters. We chose six
clusters since it meant that the deep south region was a
separate cluster. This is consistent with the fact that the
deep south is predominated by the Malay-Muslim ethnic
group, which have their own distinct health problems [4].
Cluster description
Fig. 3 shows a heat map displaying logarithms of the
SMR for the 31 disease groups stratified by mortality
cluster. The diseases are sorted in decreasing order by
their R2 value with the highest at the top.
Cluster 1 consists of super-districts with low mortality
(green shade) for many causes. Death from traffic injury
and assault were distinctly low whereas death from
colon and rectal cancer were notably high.
Cluster 2 contains super-districts having low mortality
rates from various causes but assault and traffic injury
was exceptionally high.
Cluster 3 includes super-districts with average stan-
dardized mortality rates.
Cluster 4 consists of super-districts with high mor-
tality from liver cancer, diabetes, and renal disease. In
contrast, mortality due to ischemic heart disease in
this cluster was lower than any other cluster. Cluster
5 represents super-districts with a high level of as-
sault and hypertensive heart disease, and extremely
low mortality due to self-harm, liver cancer, liver dis-
ease, and lung cancer.
Cluster 6 contains super-districts where most cause-
specific mortalities were higher than the national average.
Interpretation from the cluster analysis
These six clusters of causes of death were named as fol-
lows: cluster 1 “lowest mortality except colorectal can-
cer”, cluster 2 “generally low mortality”, cluster 3
“average mortality”, cluster 4 “high mortality from liver
cancer, diabetes, and renal diseases”, cluster 5 “high di-
versity of mortality”, and cluster 6 “high mortality”.

Socioeconomic clustering
Selecting the number of clusters
The elbow plot of R2 for socioeconomic clustering,
shown in Additional file 2, had more than one distinct
elbow. Possible choices for the number of clusters were
5, and 7. We chose 5 clusters as it resulted in being able
to distinguish Bangkok from the rest of central Thailand,
while 7 clusters resulted in some clusters having too few
super-districts.
Cluster description
Fig. 5 shows a heat map of the cluster analysis of socioeco-
nomic and demographic characteristics for all super-
districts. Five socioeconomic clusters emerged reflecting a
gradient of socioeconomic development and urbanization.
Socioeconomic cluster 1 was highly urbanized. This
cluster is represented by the well-educated, a high pro-
portion of working aged people, low level of unattached
elderly who live alone, and low level of divorced/sepa-
rated/widowed females. The average household size was
small, not crowded and contained a high proportion of
people with access to the internet.
Socioeconomic cluster 2 is represented by those with a
low overall level of socioeconomic advantages. However,
the proportion of residents living in rental dwellings and
the concentration of migrants and foreigners were high
in this cluster. This is characteristics of industrialized or
manufacturing areas.
Socioeconomic cluster 3 fell in-between all other so-
cioeconomic types and showed a slightly higher socio-
economic advantage than the national average.
Socioeconomic cluster 4 represents the disadvantaged
areas. The overall socioeconomic levels were below the
national average. This socioeconomic cluster was over-
represented by households located in non-municipal
areas with larger members per households, overcrowded
households, a high proportion of elderly and children,
and having limited access to the internet.
Finally, socioeconomic cluster 5 was also characterized
as a disadvantaged area with a notably high proportion
of low educated and illiterate individuals.
Interpretation from the cluster analysis
Based on this cluster analysis of socioeconomic profiles of
super-districts, we named these five respective clusters as
“urbanized”, “industrialized”, “the middle”, “relatively dis-
advantaged”, and “marginalized”. Fig. 6 shows a choro-
pleth

 socioeconomic clusters, suggesting spatial clustering. So-
cioeconomic cluster 1 (urbanized) contains super-districts
located in Bangkok and some provincial capital cities in
the southern region; cluster 2 (industrialized) contains
super-districts mainly located in the vicinity of Bangkok;
cluster 3 (the middle) contains super-districts located in
the lower part of the central and eastern regions, and
some major cities scattered throughout the country; clus-
ter 4 (relatively disadvantaged) contains super-districts lo-
cated in the central, northeastern, and southern regions;
and cluster 5
(marginalized) contains super-districts
mostly located at the border areas of Myanmar and
Malaysia.

clusters

The “urbanized” cluster had the largest proportion of
good health while the “marginalized” cluster had the lar-
gest percentage of poor health and higher mortality.
About 55% of all super-districts in Thailand were
classified as relatively disadvantaged (182 super dis-
tricts belonged to cluster 5), of which 90 (27% of
total super-districts) had a higher mortality due to
liver cancer, diabetes, and renal diseases. In addition,
24 super-districts (7%) were classified as marginalized,
of which 8 had a high mortality rate. The association
between mortality and socioeconomic patterns was
highly significant (p-value <0.0001).
Discussion
Based on principal components analysis, several com-
mon diseases were found to have higher excess deaths
among the low socioeconomic status super-districts than
the more affluent ones. The exception was colorectal
cancer, which was more common among the urbanized
super-districts. Cluster analysis revealed a clear cluster-
ing of cause-specific mortality and socioeconomic status
characteristics by geographical area. These cause-specific
mortality clusters were associated with different types of
socioeconomic clusters.
Principal component analysis and cluster analysis com-
plement each other as analytical tools and can be effect-
ively used to identify clusters based on socioeconomic
characteristics. Results from both PCA and cluster ana-
lysis on mortality concurred with prior studies which
demonstrate that deprived groups have higher overall

 mortality [9, 32, 33]. Socioeconomic status strongly influ-
ences the availability of and access to health services, ex-
posure to environmental hazards, and social cohesion
[34]. Several studies in Thailand have also shown that
lower socioeconomic groups have poorer health [35, 36],
higher mortality [37, 38], a higher prevalence of smoking
[39], and a higher prevalence of renal diseases [40] com-
pared with national averages.
Our PCA and cluster analysis found higher mortality
rates of colorectal cancer in the more advantaged areas.
This finding concurs with previous studies in Thailand
and China, which reported a higher incidence and mor-
tality from colorectal cancers in urban areas than in
rural areas [41, 42]. However, other studies reported that
urban populations and those with high socioeconomic
status are more likely to receive colorectal cancer
screening and higher frequency of fruit and vegetable
consumption, which are known to reduce the risk of
colorectal cancer [43, 44]. Other risk factors may play
more important roles in fatal colorectal cancer in urban
populations, such as inactive lifestyle, smoking and to-
bacco use, overweight and obesity, and low-fiber and
high-fat diet.
Although Thailand has substantially reduced poverty
and achieved considerable gains in the health status of
its
population
over
recent
decades,
poor
health
attributed from poverty remain significant. Our study
found that 55% of the Thai population resides in relatively
disadvantaged areas, for which a high proportion have high
mortality due to liver cancer, diabetes, and renal diseases.
These areas are exclusively located in the northeastern re-
gion. The high mortality of liver cancer geographically coin-
cides with
endemic areas of Opisthorchiasis in the
northeast [45–47]. Previous reviews reported similar find-
ings that low socioeconomic groups were more likely to die
from diabetes and renal diseases [48, 49]. Also, diabetes and
hypertension are two major contributing factors to end
stage renal diseases. Effective interventions, both biomed-
ical and behavioral, are required to prevent excess deaths
from liver fluke. Mortality in this study was clustered by
both overall and cause specific mortality. Populations with
high mortality rates were clustered in the northern and re-
mote mountainous areas in the west where livelihoods de-
pend heavily on agriculture as a major source of income. In
contrast, areas of generally low mortality were clustered
mainly in the southern region where people are better off,
relying on tourism and lucrative rubber and palm planta-
tions. The other three clusters were grouped by exceptional
excess mortality for one or more specific groups. For ex-
ample, the extremely higher rates for assaults of “high di-
versity of mortality” cluster in the deep south region
reflected the armed conflict situation, where assaults and

 violence have occurred in the southern part of Thailand
since 2004 [50].
One possible limitation of this study is that the quality
of mortality statistics was considered poor because a
large proportion of registered deaths are classified as be-
ing due to ill-defined conditions [51, 52]. Unspecified
causes of death were also more common in the deprived
area whereas perinatal problems were less common.
These two phenomena may be explained by different
mortality registration biases. The quality of mortality sta-
tistics varied by administrative districts in terms of the
completeness of death registration and the accuracy of
cause-of-death attribution [51–53]. Higher socioeconomic
areas had better availability of access to health care and
accurate causes of death were more likely to be clinically
certified by medical personnel. In contrast, approxi-
mately 70% of deaths in rural areas occurred outside
hospitals where cause of death is recorded and coded

 by non-medical personnel who may not be able to
specify an accurate cause of death [54]. Perinatal
deaths in rural areas were also more likely to be ig-
nored or unregistered [55, 56], thus rural areas will
appear to have lower perinatal death rates.
Another limitation is that selection of socioeconomic
variables and specific causes of death was critical in this
study. Use of different variables or causes may yield dif-
ferent results. We used only the first principal compo-
nent to construct the deprivation index, thus our index
may not have accounted for the contribution of all so-
cioeconomic variables or explained a sufficient amount
of variability [57]. The K-means algorithm is a well-
known clustering algorithm due to its robustness and ef-
ficiency in analyzing large datasets; however, it requires
the number of clusters to be pre-specified. Finding the
appropriate number of clusters for a given data set is
somewhat arbitrary and the final choice can affect the
results. [58].
Conclusion
Socially deprived areas had an excess of overall and
cause specific deaths. Specific policy measures in redu-
cing the socioeconomic gap which contribute to a reduc-
tion in health inequity can be guided by the geographical
distribution of socioeconomic clusters. The affluent
areas, despite low general mortality, still have many pre-
ventable deaths such as colorectal cancer. Further epi-
demiological studies are needed to examine certain
causes of excessive deaths in the non-deprived areas.
