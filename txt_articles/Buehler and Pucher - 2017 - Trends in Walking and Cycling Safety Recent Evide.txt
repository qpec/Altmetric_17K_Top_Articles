 Trends in Walking and Cycling Safety: Recent
Evidence From High-Income Countries, With
a Focus on the United States and Germany
Ralph Buehler, PhD, and John Pucher, PhD
Objectives. To examine changes in pedestrian and cyclist fatalities per capita (1990–
2014) and per kilometer (2000–2010) in selected high-income countries, and in fatalities
and serious injuries per kilometer by age in the United States and Germany (2001–2009).
Methods. We used Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development data to
estimate 5-year annual averages of per-capita fatalities relative to the 1990–1994 av-
erage. To control for exposure, we divided fatalities and serious injuries by kilometers of
walking or cycling per year for countries with comparable data from national household
travel surveys.
Results. Most countries have reduced pedestrian and cyclist fatality rates per capita
and per kilometer. The serious injuries data show smaller declines or even increases in
rates per kilometer.There are large differences by age group in fatality and serious injury
rates per kilometer, with seniors having the highest rates. The United States has much
higher fatality and serious injury rates per kilometer than the other countries examined,
and has made the least progress in reducing per-capita fatality rates.
Conclusions. The United States must greatly improve walking and cycling conditions. All
countries should focus safety programs on seniors and children. (Am J Public Health. 2017;107:

mproved traffic safety for pedestrians and
cyclists is an important goal of public health
policies in countries throughout the world.1–3
The World Health Organization (WHO) has
identified traffic injuries and fatalities as among
the world’s 5 most important causes of un-
natural death, with predictions that they will
become the leading cause by 2030.2 As of
2015, they were already the leading cause of
unnatural death among persons in the group
aged 15 to 29 years. Reducing pedestrian
and cyclist deaths and injuries is obviously
a benefit in itself. In addition, however, safer
walking and cycling conditions have been
shown to increase levels of walking and
cycling, especially among vulnerable or
risk-averse groups suchaschildren,seniors,and
women.4–9 Increasing walking and cycling
rates would help raise the low physical activity
levels in most developed countries, thus
contributing to improved public health.3,5,10
The Organisation for Economic Coop-
eration and Development (OECD) issues
annual reports with international comparisons
of traffic safety over recent decades.1 The
OECD reports falling rates of total traffic
fatalities per capita in most developed
countries, including the United States, where
traffic fatalities per capita fell by 46% from
1990 to 2014.1 There are large differences
among countries, however, and the United
States has suffered for many years from
a much higher traffic fatality rate per capita
than most other OECD countries. In 2014,
for example, the per-capita fatality rate in the
United States was 2 to 3 times higher than that
in most Western European countries.1 The
OECD’s published reports do not include
separate fatality rates for walking and
cycling over time. Nor do they control for
exposure rates such as the number of trips,
distance, or hours walked and cycled, which
are crucial in measuring the safety of these
2 nonmotorized modes.1 Yet another gap
in the OECD reports is the variation in
walking and cycling safety by age group.
Several studies suggest that children and
seniors are especially vulnerable to walking
and cycling injuries and fatalities.4,11
We first show trends in pedestrian and
cyclist fatalities per capita from 1990 to
2014 for 11 major OECD countries on 4
continents to provide a broader context for
the narrower analysis of the United States
and Germany that follows. Most of the article
is devoted to a detailed analysis of changes
between 2001–2002 and 2008–2009 in
pedestrian and cyclist fatalities and serious
injuries per kilometer in the United States
and Germany, disaggregated by the same 4
age groups used in both countries’ national
travel surveys: 5 to 14, 15 to 24, 25 to 64,
and 65 years and older. We focused on the
United States and Germany because their
2 most recent national travel surveys are al-
most identical in methodology and timing,
and because their data on fatalities and serious
injuries are comparably defined.12 The 2
countries are similar in other respects as well:
high per-capita incomes, high rates of car
ownership, nearly identical rates of driver
licensing, extensive high-quality road net-
works, and similarly advanced systems of
emergency medical care, both at the crash site

 and in hospitals.12–14 As noted in the Dis-
cussion section, however, there are large
differences in government policies toward
walking and cycling, thus highlighting the
importance of public policies in improving
pedestrian and cyclist safety.
METHODS
For annual data on pedestrian and cyclist
fatalities, we used the official national traffic
fatality data reported by each member
country to OECD, which expresses them
as annual totals as well as per-capita rates to
enable comparison among countries of dif-
ferent sizes.1 For almost all countries, the
fatalities include deaths occurring within
30 days of the injury. The OECD’s fatality
statistics are based on police reports, which
underestimate pedestrian and cyclist fatalities,
as noted in our discussion of data limitations
later in this article.1,15 Because only a few
countries have alternative sources of fatality
data, we used the OECD data to ensure the
same definition of traffic fatalitiesand thesame
reporting method for all countries. Upon
special request by the authors, OECDprovided
fatality data disaggregated by mode of travel
(e.g., pedestrian vs cyclist) and by age group
(5 to 14, 15 to 24, 25 to 64, and ‡ 65 y).16
For per-capita comparisons, we used the
OECD’s estimates of fatalities per 100 000
population, based on fatality and population
data provided by countries to the OECD.
Especially in countries with low cycling
levels, cyclist fatalities can fluctuate widely
from year to year because of small numbers.
To smooth out fluctuations and provide
more reliable estimates, we calculated 5-year
annual averages of fatalities per 100 000
population for both cyclists and pedestrians:
1990–1994, 1995–1999, 2000–2004,
2005–2009, 2010–2014. We only used the
OECD data since 1990 to include Germany,
which was reunified in 1990.
To focus on trends since 1990, we showed
all per-capita fatality rates relative to the
base period of 1990–1994. This also con-
trolled indirectly (albeit imperfectly) for the
very different levels of walking and cycling
in the various countries. Expressing per
capita rates relative to 1990 avoids the unfair
comparison of countries with different
walking and cycling levels and focuses instead
on the degree of improvement in each
country since 1990. It is only possible to
calculate per-kilometer fatality rates for a few
countries with reliable exposure data from
comparable travel surveys, which explains the
widespread use of per-capita rates by in-
ternational organizations (such as OECD)
to compare traffic safety among many
countries.
Whereas the per-capita data are based on
population-level numbers, the per-kilometer
rates require sample estimates from national
travel surveys to calculate exposure levels.
The samples from such surveys are scaled
up to the population level by using repre-
sentative weights. In our analysis, we calcu-
lated total kilometers walked and cycled—by
age group and in total—over roughly the
decade of 2000 to 2010 (slightly different
survey years) for the United States, Germany,
the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and
Denmark.17–21 We divided those exposure
levels into the 5- or 6-year annual average
pedestrian or cyclist fatalities for the period
bracketing each country’s survey years: the
2 years before, during, and after the US
and German surveys (which were both
conducted over a 2-year period), and the
2 years before, during, and after the UK,
Dutch, and Danish surveys (1-year survey
period).
It was only possible to calculate confidence
intervals for the United States and Germany.
The authors had access to the micro data
sets for both of their travel surveys, thus en-
abling calculation of confidence intervals and
a t test of the statistical significance of dif-
ferences between the countries and over time.
As shown in Table A in Appendix A (available
as a supplement to the online version of
this article at http://www.ajph.org), the
US and German travel surveys are highly
comparable, using the same methodology
and timing (2001–2002 and 2008–2009).
Access to the micro data sets for the United
Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Denmark
was denied to the authors, and the agencies
that conducted the surveys were not willing
to calculate the standard deviations of esti-
mates necessary for our analysis.
Moreover, the British, Dutch, and Danish
surveys used slightly different age categories
and survey years than those of the US and
German surveys. Thus, the remainder of
this article focuses on the United States and
Germany. Nevertheless, we include Figures A
and B in Appendix B, available as a supple-
ment to the online version of this article at
http://www.ajph.org, for readers who are
interested in the 5-country comparison of
fatality rates per kilometer, even though data
for the United Kingdom, the Netherlands,
and Denmark do not permit calculation of
confidence intervals, and thus do not enable
firm conclusions about statistical significance.
This article’s comparison of severe pe-
destrian and cyclist injury rates per kilometer
is limited to the United States and Germany
for the same reason. In addition, the United
Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Denmark
had definitions of severe injuries that were
not exactly comparable to those used in the
United States and Germany (overnight hos-
pitalization),butinsteadincludedlistsofspecific
kinds of injuries categorized as serious, often
in combination with the hospitalization crite-
rion.1ForboththeUnitedStatesandGermany,
we calculated 2-year annual averages of serious
injuries because both of their travel surveys
were over the same 2-year periods.
There is one difference in the severe injury
data in the United States and Germany. The
German data are population-level numbers,
based on comprehensive, nationwide col-
lection of police reports combined with
hospital reports on the status of patients.22
The US data are sample estimates from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s
(CDC’s) WISQARS injury database derived
from hospital reports and not police reports.23
The CDC uses representative weights to scale
up the sample results to population levels.
Thus, the US ratios of serious injuries to
kilometers walked or cycled are sample es-
timates of injuries divided by sample estimates
of kilometers traveled. The German ratio is
the population-level number of injuries di-
vided by a sample estimate of kilometers
traveled. Appendix C (available as a supple-
ment to the online version of this article at
http://www.ajph.org) provides details of the
methodology used to calculate fatality and
injury rates, confidence intervals, and a t test of
statistical significance.

 population in the United States, Canada,
Australia, Japan, the United Kingdom, the
Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Germany,
France, and Spain. Both the fatality and
population data on which the rates are based
are population-level numbers and not sample
estimates. Rates are shown as 5-year annual
averages for 5periods, with those average rates
expressed relative to the average for the base
period of 1990–1994.
Without exception, all 11 countries suc-
ceeded in reducing pedestrian and cyclist
fatality rates per capita between the periods of
1990–1994 and 2010–2014. By far, the least
progress has been made in the United States.
Its pedestrian fatality rate per capita fell by 35%
compared with 49% in Canada, 52% in Japan,
and 63% to 75% in Australia and the 7
Western European countries. Similarly, the
cyclist fatality rate in the United States fell by
30% compared with 46% in Australia, 47% in
Japan, 49% in Canada, and by 53% to 68% in
Western Europe. These per-capita rates do
not adjust for changes in walking and cycling

 levels over time, but the large percentage
reductions suggest improvement in walking
and cycling safety.
Table 1 shows pedestrian and cyclist fa-
tality rates per 100 million kilometers
walked and biked in the United States and
Germany for 2001–2002 and 2008–2009,
disaggregated by the same 4 age groups in
each country: 5 to 14, 15 to 24, 25 to 64, and
65 years and older. In both survey periods,
fatality rates in the United States were sig-
nificantly higher than in Germany for all age
groups (P < .05). In 2008–2009, for the
population as a whole, pedestrian fatality rates
in the United States were about 5 times higher
than in Germany (9.7 vs 1.9) and more than
3 times higher for cyclists (4.7 vs 1.3).
There is, however, much variation among
age groups. The fatality rate for senior pe-
destrians is roughly twice as high as for the
population as a whole in both the United
States (21.5 vs 9.7) and Germany (3.8 vs 1.9).
Similarly, the fatality rate for senior cyclists
is much higher than average in both the
United States (7.6 vs 4.7) and Germany
(4.2 vs 1.3). By comparison, children have
much lower fatality rates per kilometer
walked than the population as a whole in
both countries: 2.9 versus 9.7 (United States)
and 0.9 versus 1.9 (Germany). Children have
slightly lower fatality rates per 100 million
kilometers cycled: 4.1 versus 4.7 (United
States) and 0.9 versus 1.3 (Germany). In both
the United States and Germany, fatality rates
per 100 million kilometers declined for both
pedestrians and cyclists and among all age
groups from 2001–2002 to 2008–2009. The
declines were statistically significant except
for German pedestrians aged 15 to 24 years
and 25 to 64 years—for which rates fell only
slightly—and for US pedestrians and cyclists
aged 15 to 24 years and 65 years and older,
2 age groups with small sample sizes in the
National Household Travel Survey.18
As already noted, we could not calculate
confidence intervals for fatality rates per 100
million kilometers estimated for the Neth-
erlands, Denmark, and the United Kingdom.
For their populations as a whole, however,
the fatality rates for the Netherlands and
Denmark are so low, and their levels of
walking and cycling are so high (yielding large
sample sizes),24 that the estimated rates are
almost certainly statistically significantly
lower than those for the United States. For
example, for all age groups combined, the
estimated pedestrian fatality rate per 100
million kilometers in 2010 was 1.2 in the
Netherlands and 2.5 in Denmark, compared
with 9.7 in the United States (Figure A in
Appendix B). Similarly, the estimated
cyclist fatality rate in 2010 was 1.0 in the
Netherlands and 1.1 in Denmark, compared
with 4.7 in the United States (Figure B in
Appendix B). The corresponding rates for
the United Kingdom in 2010 were 2.7 for
walking and 2.5 for cycling, also much lower
than in the United States. These estimates
suggest that the United States has, by far,
the most dangerous walking and cycling
among the 5 countries. We can only report
with 95% statistical confidence, however, that
walking and cycling fatality rates per kilo-
meter are much higher in the United States
than in Germany.
Confirming the importance of injuries, the
number of severe pedestrian and cyclist in-
juries (requiring overnight hospitalization) far
exceeds the number of fatalities. In 2008–
2009, the ratio of severe injuries to fatalities
for pedestrians was 8 to 1 in the United
States and 13 to 1 in Germany. The ratio is
many times higher for cycling: 44 to 1 in the
United States and 34 to 1 in Germany.
As shown in Table 2, the rate of serious
pedestrian injuries per 100 million kilometers
in the United States rose significantly from
70.4 in 2001–2002 to 72.9 in 2008–2009
(P < .05). In Germany, the rate fell from 29.4
to 24.4 (P < .05). The rate of serious cyclist
injuries fell from 230.5 to 207.1 in the United
States (P < .05), and from 47.2 to 44.2 in
Germany (but not significantly at P < .05). For
their populations as a whole, the rate of severe
pedestrian injuries in 2008–2009 was 3.0
times higher in the United States than in
Germany, and the rate of severe cyclist in-
juries was 4.7 times higher in the United
States. As with fatalities, however, there is
variation among the 4 age groups. Most
striking for the United States is the high severe
injury rate for senior pedestrians, almost twice
the national average (131.4 vs 72.9). More-
over, that rate rose significantly from 2001–
2002 to 2008–2009 (P < .05). Similarly, the

 severe injury rate for cyclists in 2008–2009 in
the United States was much higher for chil-
dren (415.7) and seniors (337.3) than the
national average (207.1). The rate for children
rose significantly over the decade, from 392.9
to 415.7 (P < .05). The rate for seniors fell
slightly (from 351.3 to 337.3), but not sta-
tistically significantly.
In Germany, child pedestrians in 2008–
2009 had a walking injury rate 3 times as high
as the national average (74.8 vs 24.4), even
higher than the rate for children in the United
States (66.5), the only instance in Table 2 in
which the serious injury rate in Germany is
higher than that in the United States. By
comparison, the serious injury rate for senior
pedestrians in Germany in 2008–2009 was
only slightly higher than the national average
(30.4 vs 24.4), and less than a fourth the
rate for seniors in the United States (131.4).
There is less variation among age groups in
cycling injury rates in Germany than in the
United States, but children (55.9) and senior
(68.5) cyclists have higher rates than the na-
tional average (44.2). It is noteworthy that the
injury rate for child cyclists in the United
States in 2008–2009 was more than 7 times
higher than in Germany (415.7 vs 55.9) and
that the rate for senior cyclists was 5 times
higher in the United States than in Germany
(337.3 vs 68.5).
DISCUSSION
In all 11 countries shown in Figures 1
and 2, pedestrian and cyclist fatality rates per
capita fell between 1990 and 2014, but the
smallest reductions were in the United States.
Moreover, fatality rates per kilometer in 2010
were much higher in the United States
than in Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark,
and the United Kingdom. Serious injury
rates per kilometer were also much higher
in the United States than in Germany, the
2 countries with comparable injury data.
One possible explanation for greater
pedestrian and cycling safety in northern
European countries is the far more extensive
and better quality walking and cycling
infrastructure in Europe.12,25–30 In contrast
with the United States, many northern
European cities have extensive auto-free
zones in much of their centers; most neigh-
borhood streets traffic-calmed with speed
limits of 30 kilometers per hour (20 miles per
hour) or less; sidewalks on both sides of almost
every street; pedestrian refuge islands for
crossing wide streets; clearly marked cross-
walks, often raised and with special lighting;
and pedestrian signals at intersections and
midblock crosswalks with ample crossing
times. Facilitating safe and convenient cy-
cling, many northern European cities have
extensive systems of separate bikeways,
both on-road and off-road, often including
priority traffic signals and advance stop
lines for cyclists at intersections.25,31 US cities
only began building separate bike facilities
in the 1990s, and, even currently, they lag
far behind northern European cities in the
extent, quality, and integration of their
bikeways.8,13,14,24,31,32
In addition to better infrastructure, some
European countries provide mandatory traffic
education in schools—to teach safe walking
and cycling skills—and require far stricter
motorist training and licensing than in the
United States.25 Further promoting traffic
safety, police enforcement of traffic regula-
tions is much stricter in northern Europe,
both for motorists and nonmotorists.25
Although pedestrian and cyclist safety is
much higher in Germany than in the United
States, fatality rates per kilometer fell signif-
icantly in both countries for their populations
as a whole between 2001–2002 and 2008–
2009, the 2 periods of their most recent
national travel surveys. By comparison, severe
injury rates per kilometer fell significantly
only for German pedestrians, while the
severe injury rate for US pedestrians rose.
Injury rates for both German and US cyclists
fell slightly, but only statistically significantly
in the United States. In short, there has
been more improvement in reducing walking
and bicycling fatalities than serious injuries,
which greatly exceed the number of fatalities.
Moreover, there is important and statisti-
cally significant variation in both fatality
and injury rates among the 4 age groups
examined in the United States and Germany.
Senior pedestrians and cyclists have 2 to 3
times as high a fatality rate per kilometer than
the population as a whole. Seniors in the

 United States also have much higher walking
and cycling injury rates than the population
as whole, but US children have an even
higher cycling injury rate than seniors. In
Germany, children have, by far, the highest
walking injury rate—3 times the national
average—and children and seniors both have
cycling injury rates higher than the national
average. Our analysis confirms the special
vulnerability of seniors and children when
walking and cycling.
The falling per-capita fatality rates in the
United States and Germany from 1990 to
2014 and falling per-kilometer fatality rates
from 2001–2002 to 2008–2009 do not
necessarily mean that walking and cycling
conditions have been getting safer. The
likelihood of fatal injury has fallen, but
serious injury rates have fallen less (or in-
creased). The difference in fatality and serious
injury trends might be attributable to im-
proved emergency medical technology, both
at the site of the incident and at the hospital,
thus reducing the percentage of serious in-
juries resulting in death. Our findings are
consistent with those of the annual OECD
reports on overall traffic safety trends, which
find that traffic fatalities per capita have de-
clined more than serious injuries from
2000 to 2014 in member countries for which
both fatality and serious injury data are
available.1
The unknown degree of reliability and
comparability of the fatality and injury data
fundamentally limit the conclusions that can
be drawn from the analysis. Police reports
understate total pedestrian and cyclist fatalities
because they only include traffic crashes on
public roadways.1,15 For example, the CDC’s
hospital-based statistics on pedestrian and
cyclist fatalities in the United States from 1999
to 2014 averaged 16% higher for cyclists and
21% higher for pedestrians than police-
reported fatalities.1,23,33 Similarly, in the
Netherlands, hospital fatality data from 1996
to 2014 were 11% higher than police data for
pedestrians and 18% higher for cyclists.1 In
short, it is likely that the calculated fatality
rates are underestimates for all countries. In
addition, the serious injury data for the
United States and Germany are only partly
comparable. They both rely on the same
criterion of an overnight hospital stay, but the
US injury data (from CDC) are derived from
a representative sample of hospital reports,
whereas the German data are collected
through a comprehensive national canvassing
of coordinated police and hospital
reports.22,23
There is yet another reason to interpret
the fatality and injury statistics with caution.
They do not control for differences in where
and how walking and cycling take place.
Because the vast majority of pedestrian and
cyclist fatalities are attributable to collisions
with motor vehicles, roadways are the most
lethal environment for walking and cy-
cling.1,2,7,26 Walking and cycling are safer
on completely separate off-road facilities,
such as mixed-use recreational paths, or in
car-free zones, traffic-calmed residential
streets (with slower speeds and less traffic),
and physically separated on-street facilities
(such as cycle tracks).11,28,30,32,34,35 Thus, the
provision of more and better separate facilities
is a key to improving overall walking and
cycling safety. Such facilities are especially
important for children and seniors, who are
most likely to be killed or seriously injured
if hit by a motor vehicle.1,2,4,7,26
CONTRIBUTORS
J. Pucher initiated the research and led the writing of the
article. R. Buehler had primary responsibility for the data
analysis and created the tables and figures. Both authors
conceptualized the analysis and guided the study design and
data analysis. Both authors participated in interpreting the
findings and reviewing successive drafts of the article.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The authors thank Veronique Feypell of the Organisation
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD;
International Transport Forum, Paris office) for having
provided us with annual fatality data from 1990 to
2014 for each of OECD’s member countries, dis-
aggregated by age group and means of transportation.
We also thank the team of statisticians at the Virginia
Tech Department of Statistics and their Laboratory of
Interdisciplinary Statistical Analysis for their assistance
with our statistical analysis at several stages, especially with
the calculation of standard errors, confidence intervals,
and levels of statistical significance for estimates of
fatality and serious injury rates that are ratios of sample
estimates, and thus require a special methodology to
calculate statistical measures of reliability.
HUMAN PARTICIPANT PROTECTION
The analysis was based on statistical data sets and did not
require human participants.
