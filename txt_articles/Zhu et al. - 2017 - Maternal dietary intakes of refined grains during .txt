ABSTRACT
Background: Refined grains, a major source of dietary carbohy-
drates, have been related to impaired glucose homeostasis and obe-
sity. Emerging animal data suggest that in utero exposure to dietary
refined carbohydrates may predispose offspring to an obese pheno-
type, indicating a potential role for nutritional programming in the
early origins of obesity, but intergenerational human data are lacking.
Objective: We prospectively investigated refined-grain intake dur-
ing pregnancy in association with offspring growth through age 7 y
among high-risk children born to women with gestational diabetes
mellitus (GDM).
Design: The analysis included 918 mother–singleton child dyads from
the Danish National Birth Cohort. Offspring body mass index z scores
(BMIZs) were calculated by using weight and length or height mea-
sured at birth, 5 and 12 mo, and 7 y. Overweight or obesity was defined
by WHO cutoffs. Linear and Poisson regressions were used, with
adjustment for maternal demographic, lifestyle, and dietary factors.
Results: Refined-grain intake during pregnancy was positively as-
sociated with offspring BMIZ (adjusted b per serving increase per
day: 0.09; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.15) and risk of overweight or obesity at
age 7 y [adjusted RR (aRR) comparing the highest with the lowest
quartile: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.09, 2.98; P-trend = 0.032]. The association
appeared to be more pronounced among children who were
breastfed ,6 mo. The substitution of 1 serving refined grains/d with
an equal serving of whole grains during pregnancy was related to a
10% reduced risk of offspring overweight or obesity at 7 y of age
(aRR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.82, 0.98). No associations were observed
between refined-grain intake and infant growth.
Conclusions: Higher maternal refined-grain intake during preg-
nancy was significantly related to a greater BMIZ and a higher risk
of overweight or obesity at age 7 y among children born after
pregnancies complicated by GDM. The findings highlight preg-
nancy as a potential window of susceptibility associated with off-
spring growth and obesity risk among this high-risk population.
Data with longer follow-up are warranted.

INTRODUCTION
Grains are among the most commonly consumed foods in the
world (1), accounting for w25% of the daily total energy intake in
US adults, including women of reproductive age (2). Accumu-
lating evidence suggests that the sources and types of grains may
have a different impact on glycemic response and cardiometabolic
outcomes, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular
disease (3–5). In particular, refined grains with a high glycemic
index and reduced fiber and nutrient contents have been linked to
increased adiposity and a higher risk of metabolic syndrome
among adults (6, 7). Despite these differences and the growing
body of literature on the link between maternal diet and nutrition
during pregnancy and subsequent offspring health consequences
throughout the life span (8), little is known about the intergen-
erational impact of refined-grain intake during pregnancy on long-
term cardiometabolic outcomes in the offspring.
Women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), one of the
most common pregnancy complications, may predispose their
offspring to an increased risk of cardiometabolic disorders, in-
cluding obesity later in life (9, 10). It is therefore of great public
health importance to identify modifiable early-life factors that
may inform effective intervention strategies to mitigate childhood
obesity in this high-risk group. Emerging data from animal studies
suggest that in utero exposure to dietary refined carbohydrates may

 predispose offspring to an obese phenotype (11), implicating the
role of nutritional programming in the developmental origins of
obesity. However, epidemiologic studies on the intergenerational
association of maternal diet, in particular, the intake of refined
grains, during pregnancy with offspring growth and risk of over-
weight or obesity during infancy and childhood are lacking.
To address this critical data gap, we aimed to investigate the
intergenerational association between refined-grain intake during
pregnancy and offspring growth and risk of obesity through the
first 7 y of life among women with GDM, as a unique model of a
high-risk population to study early origins of obesity. We used
data from the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC), a pop-
ulation who traditionally consume relatively large amounts of
grains as staple foods common to the Scandinavian countries.
METHODS
Study population and design
The DNBC is a longitudinal cohort of 91,827 women (101,042
pregnancies) recruited between 1996 and 2002, accounting
for w36% of pregnancies in Denmark during the study period
(12). Briefly, pregnant women who spoke Danish, intended to
carry their pregnancy to term, and had a permanent address in
Denmark were invited to participate in the study at their first
antenatal visit to the general practitioner around weeks 6–12 of
gestation. Information on sociodemographic, perinatal, and
medical factors was collected from 4 computer-assisted tele-
phone interviews at gestational weeks 12 and 30 and postpartum
months 6 and 18. In addition, a semiquantitative food-frequency
questionnaire (FFQ) was mailed to the participants at gestational
week 25. When the child was 7 y old, a follow-up questionnaire
about the child’s health and development was sent by mail or
electronically to the parents. The DNBC was approved by the
Danish National Committee on Biomedical Research Ethics.
Informed consent was obtained from all participants.
Of 101,402 pregnancies in the DNBC cohort, we identified
1379 pregnancies complicated by GDM documented from the
30-wk-of-gestation or 6-mo-postpartum study interviews or the
Danish National Patient Registry. During the study period,
the WHO criteria (13) or local practices (14) were applied for a
diagnosis of GDM. Both verified and self-reported cases were
included to maximize the possibility of identifying pregnancies
complicated by hyperglycemia. We sequentially
excluded
pregnancies with missing dietary data from the FFQ (n = 346),
implausible daily energy intakes (,4000 or .20,000 kJ/d; n = 14),
no data on offspring growth at birth and any follow-up (n = 2),
multiple gestations (n = 24), prepregnancy diabetes verified by
medical records (n = 57), and recurrent GDM (n = 18), which
rendered a total of 918 mother-offspring pairs as our analytic
sample. At follow-up, data from offspring with available anthro-
pometric measures at birth (n = 918), 5 mo (n = 589), 12 mo
(n = 575), or 7 y (n = 531) were included in the final analysis
(see Supplemental Figure 1).
Exposure assessment
Maternal dietary intakes were estimated by using a validated
360-item FFQ distributed at gestational week 25 (15, 16), which
included questions about dietary intake during the previous
month. Dietary intake and the nutrient content of each food were
quantified on the basis of standard portion sizes (17) and the
Danish Food-Composition Tables, version 6.02 (18). Nutrient
intakes were adjusted for total energy intake by using the residual
method (19). By definition, the following foods and ingredients
were considered refined grains: white bread, rice, pasta, bread
rolls, crisp bread, crackers, and cookies. Whole grains included
rye bread, rye flour, whole-wheat bread, whole-wheat flour,
barley grouts, wheat kernels, wheat bran, and brown rice.
Outcome measures
Each child’s birth weight and length were extracted from the
Danish Medical Birth Registry. To assess birth size, macrosomia
was defined as a birth weight .4500 g. Ponderal index at birth
was calculated as birth weight (in kilograms) divided by cubed
birth length (in meters). Child’s weight and recumbent length at
5 and 12 mo were measured by the general practitioner at the
respective postnatal visits and recorded in the Child’s Book,
which was kept by the parent or parents. During the 18-mo
postpartum interview, the parent or parents referred to the
Child’s Book and reported their child’s anthropometric mea-
sures obtained by the general practitioner at 5 and 12 mo, re-
spectively. The child’s weight and height at mean age 7.0 y
(SD = 0.3 y) were reported by the parent or parents from the 7-y
follow-up questionnaire on the basis of measurements obtained
by general practitioners, school nurses, or parents. Age- and sex-
specific BMI z scores (BMIZs) were calculated by using the
WHO Child Growth Standards for infants and children aged
,5 y (20) and the WHO Growth Reference for those aged $5 y
(21). We further classified children as overweight or obese by
using the corresponding age- and sex-specific WHO cutoffs
[i.e., $85 percentile for children aged ,5 y (20) and $2 SDs for
those aged $5 y (21)].
Covariates
Data on parity (nulliparous or multiparous), socioeconomic
status [high (high- or medium-level professionals), middle
(skilled workers), or low (unskilled workers and others); de-
termined by the highest level within the couple], prepregnancy
BMI categories [in kg/m2; ,25.0, 25.0–29.9, or $30.0; calcu-
lated as self-reported prepregnancy weight (kilograms) divided
by squared height (meters)], smoking during pregnancy (yes or
no), and supplements during pregnancy (yes or no) were ob-
tained from interviews at gestational weeks 12 and 30. Data on
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (yes or no) during the
third trimester were obtained from the interview at gestational
week 30. Information on age at index childbirth (year) was ex-
tracted from medical records. Dietary covariates significantly
correlated with refined-grain intake were assessed by the FFQ,
including red meat; processed or mixed meat; desserts and sweets;
oil, margarine, or butter; whole grains; sugar-sweetened beverages;
and potatoes (all in grams per day). The overall glycemic index
was calculated by summing the products of the available carbo-
hydrate content of each food item and the glycemic index of that
food, divided by the total intake of available carbohydrate (22).
With regard to early-life factors in the offspring, information on
breastfeeding duration ($6 mo or ,6 mo) was collected from
interviews at 6 and 18 mo postpartum, whereas offspring physical

 activity ($2 h/weekday or ,2 h/weekday) and intake frequency
of sugar-sweetened beverages ($1 time/wk or ,1 time/wk) and
other dietary factors (intakes of vegetables, fruit, meat, and des-
serts and sweets) were obtained from the 7-y follow-up
questionnaire.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics are presented as means 6 SDs for
continuous variables and percentages for categorical variables.
P values for group comparisons across quartiles of refined-grain
intakes during pregnancy were obtained by ANOVA for con-
tinuous variables and by chi-square test for categorical variables.
Linear regression models were used to estimate b coefficients
and 95% CIs for continuous measures of offspring growth
(i.e., Ponderal index at birth and BMIZ at follow-up) in asso-
ciation with maternal refined-grain intake during pregnancy [per
serving (1 ounce, 28.35-g equivalent)/d], after adjustment for
maternal sociodemographic, lifestyle, and dietary factors. RRs
and 95% CIs for offspring risk of macrosomia at birth and
overweight or obesity at 5 mo, 12 mo, and 7 y in association
with refined-grain intake in quartiles were assessed by using
Poisson regression with robust SEs (23). Tests for linear trend
were conducted across quartiles of refined-grain consumption by
using the median value in each quartile as a continuous variable
in the models. We also assessed these associations comparing
women with extremely high intakes of refined grains during
pregnancy (i.e., in the top decile) with their counterparts in the
lowest quartile. To explore the potential mechanisms underlying
the associations between refined-grain intake and offspring risk
of overweight or obesity, we further adjusted for glycemic index
and cereal fiber intake during pregnancy.
We estimated the effect of substituting 1 serving refined grains/d
with an equivalent serving of alternative foods (i.e., whole grains,
vegetables excluding potatoes, fruit, or legumes) on offspring risk
of overweight or obesity by including both food intakes (refined
grains and an alternative food) as continuous variables in the same
multivariable model, after adjustment for the above-mentioned
covariates. RRs and 95% CIs for the substitution associa-
tions were estimated by using the computed difference in their
b coefficients, difference in their variances, and their covari-
ance (24).
To test the potential effect modification by early-life factors
that have been linked to the risk of childhood obesity (25–27), we
added a cross-product of the potential modifier and maternal
refined-grain intake. Furthermore, we conducted stratified
analyses by breastfeeding duration ($6 mo or ,6 mo), offspring
physical activity ($2 h/weekday or ,2 h/weekday), and intake
of sugar-sweetened beverages ($1 time/wk or ,1 time/wk) and
other dietary factors (vegetables, fruit, meat, and desserts and
sweets) at age 7 y. We also conducted sensitivity analyses re-
stricted to women who did not use any medications [insulin
(n = 58) or other/unspecified (n = 10)] for GDM treatment
during pregnancy (n = 850, 93%), who did not have hyperten-
sive complications during pregnancy (n = 839, 91%), who de-
livered term births (n = 862, 94%), and whose children did not
have congenital anomalies (2 with orofacial defects) or chronic
diseases (i.e., 54 with asthma, allergy, cerebral palsy, or type 1
diabetes during childhood; n = 862, 94%). In addition, we ex-
amined the impact of nonresponse on offspring anthropometric

 measures by examining whether participant characteristics dif-
fered between mother-offspring pairs lost to follow-up (n1)
and those retained at each follow-up (n2; n1/n2: 589/329,
575/343, and 531/387 at the 5-mo, 12-mo, and 7-y follow-ups,
respectively). Last, to assess the potential impact of residual
confounding due to unmeasured dietary changes or other GDM
treatment effect during the third trimester, we conducted sensi-
tivity analyses additionally adjusting for fasting plasma glucose
concentrations measured during the diagnostic oral-glucose chal-
lenge test and gestational weight gain, as indicators of GDM se-
verity and management, respectively. All of the analyses were
conducted by using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute) with 2-tailed
P values ,0.05 considered significant for main effects.
RESULTS
Among the 918 women with pregnancies complicated by
GDM, the mean 6 SD age at the index childbirth was 31.3 6
4.6 y (Table 1). The mean 6 SD intake of refined grains
during pregnancy was 86.2 6 49.4 g/d. Across increasing
quartiles of maternal refined-grain intake during pregnancy,
women tended to have a higher intake of total energy and a
higher percentage of energy from total fat but a lower per-
centage of energy from protein. In addition, a higher intake of
refined grains was associated with higher intakes of red meat;
processed or mixed meat; desserts and sweets; oil, butter, and
margarine; and potatoes but lower intakes of cereal fiber.
Offspring characteristics at baseline, including sex, gestational
age at delivery, birth weight, and other measures of birth size,
did not vary significantly across quartiles of maternal refined-
grain intake during pregnancy, whereas women with higher
intakes of refined grains during pregnancy were more likely to
have preterm deliveries.
After adjustment for maternal sociodemographic, lifestyle, and
dietary factors including total energy intake, every increment of 1
serving refined grains/d during pregnancy was associated with an
increase of 0.09 SD (95% CI: 0.02, 0.15 SD) in offspring BMIZ at
age 7 y (Table 2). No associations were observed with offspring
Ponderal index at birth or BMIZ at 5 or 12 mo. Furthermore,
maternal refined-grain intake during pregnancy was significantly
associated with a higher risk of overweight or obesity at age 7 y
(Table 3), whereas null associations were observed with macrosomia
at birth or overweight or obesity in infancy (see Supplemental
Table 1). Specifically, offspring born to women with refined-grain
intakes in the highest quartile (quartile 4: $4.3 servings/d) were
1.8-fold (95% CI: 1.09-, 2.98-fold) more likely to be overweight
or obese at age 7 y than their counterparts in the lowest quartile
(quartile 1: ,1.8 servings/d) (model 2, Table 3). The association
was more pronounced when comparing women with extremely
high intakes in the top decile ($5.3 servings/d) with those in
quartile 1 (RR: 2.57; 95% CI: 1.32, 5.00). To explore the po-
tential mechanism, we further adjusted for glycemic index, but
the results did not materially change (RR comparing quartile 4
with quartile 1: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.08, 2.98; P-trend across
quartiles = 0.034; data not shown), whereas the association was
attenuated after further adjustment for cereal fiber intake (RR
comparing quartile 4 with quartile 1: 1.63; 95% CI: 0.96, 2.75;
P-trend across quartiles = 0.119; data not shown). Sensitivity
analysis showed similar, robust results restricted to pregnancies
in women not taking medications for GDM (93%), without
hypertensive complications during pregnancy (91%), with term
deliveries (94%), or with births without congenital anomalies or
other chronic diseases (94%) (Figure 1; see point estimates in
Supplemental Tables 2 and 3). Furthermore, in sensitivity
analyses with additional adjustment for fasting plasma glucose
concentrations measured during the oral-glucose challenge test

25.0–29.9, or $30.0), smoking during pregnancy (yes or no), moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity during pregnancy (yes or no), supplements
during pregnancy (yes or no), and intakes of red meat, processed or mixed meat, desserts and sweets, whole grains, sugar-sweetened beverages, potatoes, and
oil, margarine, and butter (grams per day). *P , 0.05. GDM, gestational diabetes mellitus; Q, quartile; ref, reference.

 and gestational weight gain, results remained robust and mate-
rially unchanged (see Supplemental Table 4).
Although no significant independent association was observed
between whole-grain intake and the risk of overweight or obesity
at age 7 y (RR comparing quartile 4 with quartile 1: 0.97; 95% CI:
0.58, 1.61; data not shown), substituting 1 serving refined
grains/d with 1 serving whole grains/d was associated with a
lower risk of offspring overweight or obesity at age 7 y by 10%
(RR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.82, 0.98; Figure 2). No significant risk
reduction was observed for substituting 1 serving refined
grains/d with intakes of vegetables (excluding potatoes; per
100 g), fruit (per 100 g), or legumes (per 100 g) daily.
In the stratified analyses by early-life factors, the association
tended to be more prominent among children who were breastfed
,6 mo after adjustment for maternal covariates (Table 4), al-
though the test of interaction was not significant (P-interaction =
0.14). The associations did not significantly vary by child’s
physical activity, intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (Table 4),
or other childhood dietary factors at age 7 y (intakes of vegeta-
bles, fruit, meat, dairy, and desserts and sweets; data not shown).
Moreover, baseline characteristics of mother-offspring pairs
lost to follow-up due to missing offspring anthropometric
measures did not differ substantially from those included in the
analytic sample, with the exception that those lost to the 7-y
follow-up were slightly more likely to have a low socioeconomic
status (see Supplemental Table 5). Furthermore, maternal di-
etary intakes of total energy, refined grains, and other major food
groups during pregnancy did not differ between those lost to
follow-up and those retained at the 7-y follow-up.
DISCUSSION
In this prospective study, we found that a higher intake of
refined grains during pregnancy was significantly associated
with a higher BMIZ and a greater risk of overweight or obesity at
age 7 y among offspring born to women with GDM, even after
adjustment for maternal sociodemographic, lifestyle, and di-
etary factors. The associations appeared to be more pronounced
among children who were breastfed for ,6 mo. Furthermore, the

 substitution of 1 serving refined grains/d with an equivalent
serving of whole grains was significantly associated with a lower
risk of offspring overweight or obesity at age 7 y.
Despite the limited data on refined-grain intake during preg-
nancy, the median daily intake of refined grains in this population
of Danish women with GDM (median: 73.3 g; range: 3.6–
355.5 g) was similar to the intake observed among adults aged
40–69 y in another Scandinavian country, Finland (29), but
greater than that among nonpregnant women in the United
States (30). To the best of our knowledge, we are unaware of
previous
prospective
epidemiologic
studies
on
the
in-
tergenerational association of refined-grain intake during preg-
nancy with offspring growth and the risk of overweight or
obesity, either among the general population or within the
context of a high-risk population of children born to women
with GDM. However, our findings are biologically plausible.
Emerging yet limited animal evidence suggests that in utero
exposure to refined carbohydrates is associated with an in-
creased activity of the sympathetic nervous system and dysre-
gulated gene expression for the insulin-regulated glucose
transporter type 4 in the offspring (11, 31), which, in turn, is
related to hyperinsulinemia and increased adiposity (32).
Of note, the positive association between refined-grain intake
during pregnancy and offspring risk of overweight or obesity was
not present during infancy but only at age 7 y. The specific
mechanisms underpinning the age-specific association remain to
be elucidated. Nonetheless, it is possible that the clustered diet,
family environment, and other obesity-related risk behaviors
shared between women and their offspring could potentially
play a role, which may become more apparent at a later age
among the offspring as indicated by the obesity phenotype (33).
Also notably, the validity of BMIZ as an indicator of infant
adiposity remains controversial and to be further evaluated (34,
35). Future studies with more direct measures of infant adiposity
via body-composition assessment tools are warranted.
Our findings are biologically plausible, although the un-
derlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. The milling
during food processing of refined-grain products reduces fiber,

 bioactive phytochemicals, and other nutrient contents, thus po-
tentially lowering their nutritional quality (36). In particular, the
inherent low-fiber content of refined-grain foods may alter
profiles of satiety hormones and expression of genes involved in
glucose and lipid metabolism (37) and increase adiposity in
offspring (38). As shown in our study, further adjustment for
cereal fiber intake attenuated the association between maternal
refined-grain intake during pregnancy and offspring risk of
overweight or obesity at age 7 y, which suggests that cereal fiber
intake might partially explain the association. In addition, a diet
rich in whole grains and low in refined grains appears to be
effective in normalizing blood glucose concentrations among
women with GDM (39), whereas maternal glucose concentra-
tions during pregnancy have been positively related to the risk of
childhood obesity, as observed in our own study population (40).
Collectively, these data are consistent with our finding that di-
etary substitution of refined grains with whole grains during
pregnancy is associated with a lower risk of offspring overweight
or obesity at 7 y of age. Future prospective dietary intervention
studies to confirm these findings and to explore mechanisms
underlying these intergenerational associations are warranted.
Notable strengths of this study include the prospective design
with repeated measures of childhood anthropometric variables,
which represents a unique opportunity to investigate the in-
tergenerational association of refined-grain intake during preg-
nancy with offspring obesity after adjustment for important
confounders. Furthermore, given the available data on childhood
lifestyle factors, we were able to explore the effect modification
by these early-life factors as indicators of shared family lifestyle.
However, we acknowledge that there were several potential
limitations. First, childhood weight and height at age 7 y were
reported by the parent or parents on the basis of measurements
from health professionals or from parents with inevitable mea-
surement errors. Nonetheless, previous data showed high cor-
relations between parent-reported and measured anthropometric
variables among 7- to 9-y-old children (r = 0.942 for height,
r = 0.925 for weight, r = 0.813 for BMI; P , 0.001) (41).
Furthermore, due to the prospective nature of the data, the po-
tential measurement errors should be unrelated to the dietary
exposure. Second, prepregnancy weight and height were self-
reported. However, as shown by previous studies (42, 43),
women’s prepregnancy weight status based on BMI calculated by
self-reported prepregnancy weight and height was in substantial
agreement with measurements obtained during the first trimester
(Pearson’s correlation r = 0.98, P , 0.001; k statistic = 0.78).
Third, maternal dietary intakes were self-reported by using the
FFQ at gestational week 25, with potential recall bias and ex-
posure misclassification. However, the FFQ was validated
against a 7-d weighed food record and was shown to be appli-
cable to analyses on a food-group level (16). Moreover, we did
not have data on maternal diet in the third trimester after GDM
diagnosis. Despite the potential overadjustment bias, we con-
ducted sensitivity analyses with additional adjustment for fasting
plasma glucose concentrations measured during the diagnostic
oral-glucose challenge test and gestational weight gain as indica-
tors of GDM severity and management. Reassuringly, results re-
mained robust and similar. Last, the loss to follow-up could have
reduced the statistical power and introduced selection bias. No-
tably, our results at birth and at 5 and 12 mo did not seem to be
largely limited by statistical power given the significant and robust
associations observed between maternal refined-grain intake dur-
ing pregnancy and offspring growth outcomes at age 7 y. None-
theless, there is no certain way of knowing the effect of dropouts on
growth outcomes at follow-ups. The loss to follow-up may, in fact,
have either underestimated or overestimated the true effect sizes,
including those at 7 y. Furthermore, selection bias seems unlikely
or minimal given that the major maternal and child characteristics
at baseline and maternal dietary factors including intake of refined
grains during pregnancy did not differ substantially between par-
ticipants lost to follow-up and those retained at follow-up.
In conclusion, we found significant and positive associations of
maternal refined-grain intake during pregnancy with offspring
BMIZ and the risk of overweight or obesity at age 7 y among the
high-risk children born to women with GDM. Our study adds to
the emerging, yet limited, data on the possible intergenerational
association of refined-grain intake during pregnancy with adverse
offspring cardiometabolic outcomes and suggests that these as-
sociations may become more apparent after infancy. It also
underlines the need for future prospective studies with longer
follow-up through later childhood, adolescence, and adulthood to
evaluate whether our findings persist in later life.
