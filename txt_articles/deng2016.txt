ABSTRACT
Objective Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a
pre-dementia state; 5–10% of cases per year will
evolve into dementia. MCI can be amnestic
(AMCI) or non-amnestic. AMCI is associated with
a higher risk of progression. In recent years,
interest in acupuncture as a potential treatment
for AMCI has grown. The aim of this meta-
analysis was to estimate the clinical effectiveness
and safety of acupuncture for AMCI.
Methods Randomised controlled trials (RCTs)
of acupuncture versus medical treatment for
AMCI were identified using the following
databases from inception to July 2015:
PubMed; Medline; CENTRAL; Chinese Scientific
Journal Database; The Chinese Acupuncture
Trials Register; China National Knowledge
Infrastructure (CNKI); and Wanfang database.
Data were extracted from RCTs meeting the
inclusive criteria according to Cochrane
methods. Meta-analyses were conducted using
Rev Man V.5.3 software.
Results Five trials involving 568 subjects were
included. Meta-analysis showed that
participants receiving acupuncture had better
outcomes than those receiving nimodipine with
greater clinical efficacy rates (odds ratio (OR)
1.78, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.65; p<0.01), mini-
mental state examination (MMSE) scores (mean
difference (MD) 0.99, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.28;
p<0.01), and picture recognition score (MD
2.12, 95% CI 1.48 to 2.75; p<0.01). Meta-
analysis also showed acupuncture in
conjunction with nimodipine significantly
improved MMSE scores (MD 1.09, 95% CI 0.29
to 1.89; p<0.01) compared to nimodipine
alone. Three trials reported adverse events.
Methodological quality of the included studies
was judged to be generally poor.
Conclusions Acupuncture appears effective for
AMCI when used as an alternative or adjunctive
treatment; however, caution must be exercised
given the low methodological quality of
included trials. Further, more rigorously
designed studies are needed.
INTRODUCTION
Dementia is characterised by progressive
cognitive decline and is an increasingly
common phenomenon within our ageing
population.1 The most common type of
dementia is Alzheimer’s disease (AD),
which accounts for at least half of cases
and
is
a
permanent
and
irreversible
disease.2
Mild
cognitive
impairment
(MCI)
refers
to
a
transitional
state
between normal ageing and dementia.
Around 5–10% of cases of MCI will
evolve into dementia per year.3–5 As a
pre-dementia stage, MCI is defined by a
subtle, clinical deterioration in memory
performance to a level below that of
normal ageing but which does not consti-
tute a clinical diagnosis of dementia.5
A
Canadian
study
demonstrated
that
almost half of patients with MCI will
progress to fulfill the diagnostic criteria
of dementia after 5 years.6 MCI based on
memory deficits can be categorised as
amnestic
(AMCI)
and
non-amnestic.
AMCI is characterised by a decline in
memory
capacity
with
retention
of
largely intact executive functions.7 It has
been confirmed that AMCI patients have
a higher chance of proceeding to AD
than those with no such cognitive altera-
tions.8 Cognitive impairments and psy-
chological symptoms form an integral
part of MCI. To date, no intervention has
been proven to prevent conversion to
dementia. However, several studies have
suggested
that
acupuncture
might
be
beneficial in MCI.9
Traditional Chinese acupuncture has
been practised for more than 3000 years.
Recent research has reported that acu-
puncture may be an effective adjunctive
therapy for neurological diseases, includ-
ing stroke,10 Parkinson’s disease,11 vascu-
lar
dementia,12
and
AD.13
In
recent
years, a number of basic and clinical

 studies have provided evidence that acupuncture is
beneficial for the treatment of dementia or MCI.14 15
The potential mechanisms of action underlying its
putative
effects
in
cognitively
impaired
patients
include enhanced release of neurotrophic factors,
reduced oxidative stress and expression of apoptosis-
related genes, improved synaptic plasticity, and prolif-
eration and survival of neuronal precursor cells in the
hippocampal CA1 and dentate gyrus area.16–18
Although the use of acupuncture for AMCI has
attracted growing interest, a comprehensive evaluation
of the effect of the acupuncture intervention on
behavioural and psychological symptoms of AMCI
compared with other treatments is lacking. Therefore,
the aim of the present study was to perform a system-
atic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials of acu-
puncture for the treatment of patients with AMCI.
METHODS
Inclusion criteria
Randomised
controlled
trials
(RCTs)
or
quasi-
randomised clinical trials evaluating the comparative
effectiveness of acupuncture for AMCI were included.
Diagnostic criteria were adopted in accordance with
the 2006 Chinese expert consensus on cognitive dys-
function19 and other clinical guidelines.5 For a study
to be included, patients in the experimental group
needed to have received acupuncture (either alone or
in conjunction with other treatment modalities) and
patients in the control group needed to have been
receiving another active treatment. The outcome mea-
surements needed to include at least one authority
scale of cognitive assessment such as the Montreal
cognitive
assessment
(MoCA),
mini-mental
state
examination (MMSE), clock drawing task (CDT) or
W
echsler memory scale (WMS). There was no limita-
tion placed on language of publication or publication
type.
Literature search and study selection
W
e performed a medical literature search of the fol-
lowing databases from their inception until July 2015:
PubMed; Medline; Cochrane Central Register of
Controlled
Trials
(CENTRAL);
Chinese
Scientific
Journal Database; The Chinese Acupuncture Trials
Register; China National Knowledge Infrastructure
(CNKI); and the W
anfang Database. The key search
terms in these databases were as follows: [‘mild cogni-
tive impairment’ OR ‘amnestic mild cognitive impair-
ment’ OR ‘cognitive impairment’ OR ‘MCI’ OR
‘AMCI’] AND [‘acupuncture’ OR ‘meridian’ OR ‘acu-
puncture
treatment’
OR
‘acupuncture
therapy’].
Animal experiments, reviews and duplicate articles
were excluded.
Data extraction and quality assessment
T
wo reviewers (X-FW and MD) independently evalu-
ated the search results, identified studies meeting our
inclusion criteria, and collected the relevant informa-
tion using a standardised data extraction form, which
included the name of the author, year of publication,
number of participants, average age of the partici-
pants,
details
of
acupuncture
treatment,
type
of
control, treatment course, cognitive outcome measure-
ments, adverse effects, and quality of trial design. Risk
of bias of the included RCTs was evaluated using the
Cochrane
criteria.20
Any
disagreements
regarding
methodological quality were resolved by discussion
until consensus was reached.
Data synthesis and statistical analysis
The statistical analysis was performed using RevMan
V
.5.3 (Cochrane Collaboration). Effect estimates for
dichotomous data were presented as odds ratios (ORs)
with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and con-
tinuous data were presented as mean differences
(MDs) and their 95% CIs. The standard χ2 test and I2
test were used to assess the heterogeneity of the data.
A random effects model was employed when there
was significant heterogeneity, otherwise a fixed effects
model was used.
RESULTS
Literature search
Our initial electronic database search identified 215
potential literature citations, from which 34 dupli-
cated articles, 108 animal studies, and six reviews
were excluded. Following the initial screening of titles
and abstracts, 57 studies were excluded because they
were either case reports (two studies), lacked a com-
parison group (25 studies) or because the trials did
not focus on acupuncture therapy for AMCI (30
studies). T
en randomised trials were obtained for full-
text assessment. After applying the inclusion criteria,
five studies14 21–24 were ultimately included in the
qualitative
synthesis
and
meta-analysis.
A
flow
diagram of the search strategy is shown in figure 1.
Characteristics of included trials
The five included RCTs were published between 2012
and 2013. The total number of AMCI participants
was 568, with 288 patients allocated to the acupunc-
ture group (experimental group) and 280 patients
allocated to receive conventional medication, namely
nimodipine (control group). Three trials directly com-
pared
acupuncture
with
nimodipine
(comparative
effectiveness) and two trials examined the role of acu-
puncture
as
an
adjunct
to
nimodipine,
wherein
patients in both groups received medical therapy and
were randomised to receiving additional acupuncture
or not. The number of participants in each study
varied from 26 to 94 and acupuncture treatment was
provided three to five times per week for 8 weeks in
all but one trial, in which treatment lasted 3 months.
All trials used electroacupuncture (EA) (frequency 3–

 15 Hz, intensity 2–4 mA) and each treatment session
lasted 30 min. The most frequently used acupuncture
points were GV20 (Baihui), GB20 (Fengchi), GV24
(Shenting)
and
Sishencong.
Outcome
measures
included clinical efficacy rate, MMSE, picture recogni-
tion, CDT
, MBI (modified Barthel index), and HDS-R
(revised Hasegawa dementia scale). Other character-
istics of the studies are summarised in table 1.
Methodological quality
All five included studies reported the baseline data of
the participants and mentioned random sequence gen-
eration. One trial21 used a random number table to
allocate
participants
to
treatment
groups.
The
sequence generation of another trial24 was based on
visiting time point and was therefore considered to
only
be
quasi-randomised.
The
remaining
three
trials14 22 23 did not describe the method of random
sequence generation. No trial mentioned allocation
concealment and none used a sham intervention,
therefore blinding of participants or practitioners was
not applicable to this review. The methodological
quality of each trial is summarised in figure 2.
Acupuncture versus conventional therapy
Three trials14 21 22 randomising a total of 403 patients
compared acupuncture with nimodipine. Clinical effi-
cacy rate at the end of the treatment was reported in
all
three
trials
with
no
significant
heterogeneity
(I2=0%, p=0.73, figure 3A). Meta-analysis demon-
strated that the clinical efficacy rate was significantly
higher in the acupuncture group compared with the
control group (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.65;
p<0.01). MMSE at the end of the treatment was also
measured in all three trials with minimal heterogen-
eity (I2=5%, p=0.35, figure 3B).14
21
22 Meta-
analysis
showed
that
acupuncture
significantly
improved MMSE scores relative to the control group
(MD 0.99, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.28; p<0.01). Picture

 recognition at the end of the treatment was measured in
two of the trials14 22 with 342 patients in total and no
significant heterogeneity (I2=0%, p=0.56, figure 3B).
Meta-analysis demonstrated that acupuncture improved
picture recognition scores compared to the control
group (MD 2.12, 95% CI 1.48 to 2.75; p<0.01).
Finally
, two trials14 21 included CDT scores; however,
one of these14 did not report CDT results after treat-
ment. The other21 reported that patients treated with
acupuncture did not significantly increase their CDT
scores compared with those of the control group.
Acupuncture as an adjunct to conventional therapy
T
wo trials23 24 evaluated acupuncture as an adjunct to
nimodipine. One trial24 reported that patients treated
with acupuncture and nimodipine exhibited increased
clinical efficacy rate compared to treatment with
nimodipine alone (figure 4A). The other23 showed
that patients treated with acupuncture and nimodipine
had increased picture recognition scores compared to
nimodipine therapy alone (figure 4B). MMSE at the
end of the treatment was measured in two trials23 24
with
174
patients
and
moderate
heterogeneity
(I2=49%, p=0.16, figure 4B). Meta-analysis found
that acupuncture combined with nimodipine signifi-
cantly improved MMSE scores compared to nimodi-
pine therapy alone (MD 1.09, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.89;
p<0.01).
Adverse events
Three studies22–24 reported adverse events in detail.
The
adverse
events
associated
with
acupuncture
included errhysis at the needle sites23 24 and fainting
during treatment.22 Adverse events associated with
nimodipine
therapy
predominantly
consisted
of
gastrointestinal reactions and mild headache.22 T
wo
studies14 21 did not report whether any adverse events
or side effects had occurred in the experimental or
control groups.
DISCUSSION
Although acupuncture has been used clinically in the
management of AMCI in recent years,14 no systematic
review or meta-analysis has been performed to eva-
luate the effectiveness of acupuncture specifically for
this condition. The present study analysed data from
five RCTs involving 568 individuals to summarise and
evaluate the available evidence on the efficacy and
safety of acupuncture therapy for AMCI. All trials
used EA in the treatment group. Moreover, the
treatment was generally consistent in several other
respects,
including
the
number,
frequency
and
duration of the acupuncture sessions, the acupunc-
ture points selected and the comparator groups, all
of
which
might
have
helped
decrease
clinical
heterogeneity to some extent. Our meta-analysis
suggested that acupuncture treatment had a signifi-
cant effect on clinical efficacy rate compared to a
nimodipine control group. Similarly, acupuncture
therapy significantly improved MMSE and picture
recognition scores compared with nimodipine therapy.
Overall, our meta-analysis suggests that acupuncture
was a useful therapy in improving cognitive function
for patients with AMCI. It also suggested that acu-
puncture was effective when used as an adjunctive
treatment to nimodipine for AMCI. However, these
seemingly positive findings must be interpreted cau-
tiously due to the low methodological quality of the
included RCTs. Furthermore, in this review, only
three of five studies mentioned adverse events. The
side effects of the treatment group were acupuncture
point errhysis and fainting during acupuncture treat-
ment, while those of the nimodipine control group

 included gastrointestinal reaction and mild headache.
The two other RCTs did not report on adverse events
or side effects at all. Thus, although the existing litera-
ture on acupuncture suggests that it is a relatively safe
treatment modality, conclusions regarding the safety
of acupuncture therapy specifically for AMCI cannot
be reached.
The methodological quality of the included studies
was judged to be generally poor because there was
high or unclear risk of bias. Three of the five RCTs
included in this meta-analysis mentioned random
sequence generation, but failed to describe concretely
the way in which it was achieved. The random
sequence generation of one trial was performed
according to visiting time points, which is not consid-
ered true randomisation. No study reported allocation
concealment or blinding assessment. The suboptimal
methodological quality of the primary data (poor
internal validity) unavoidably inhibits a robust evalu-
ation of the effectiveness of acupuncture for AMCI.
There were several potential limitations of this
review. Although one trial was published in English,
all included RCTs were conducted in China, which
might implicate publication bias.25 Chinese patients
may have a preference for acupuncture treatment over
medical intervention, and the design of the included
studies did not control for potential placebo effects.
Therefore, rigorous clinical studies in W
estern settings
should be considered before extrapolating the results
to other populations. Future trials should also take
placebo effects into consideration in order to provide
evidence of a specific effect of acupuncture.26 27 The
sample
populations
of
included
studies
in
this
meta-analysis
were
small,
with
>100
patients
recruited in only two of the five trials. Additionally,
differences in acupuncture practitioners might intro-
duce deviations in the effect size attributable to acu-
puncture therapy.
Given the methodological limitations of the current
evidence base, we would recommend that future clin-
ical trials should be conducted more rigorously and be
reported
in
accordance
with
the
Consolidated
Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) state-
ment28 for RCTs and the Standards for Reporting
Interventions
in
Clinical
Trials
of
Acupuncture
(STRICTA)
guidelines29
for
acupuncture
studies.
Allocation concealment and blinding of outcome
assessors should be applied, and the type of random-
isation
and
acupuncture
procedures
should
be
described in detail. Although acupuncture therapy is
generally well tolerated, a condition-specific safety
evaluation should also be rigorously carried out and
reported in future trials.
In conclusion, the results of this meta-analysis
suggest that acupuncture therapy has a significant
positive effective on cognitive and memory function
in patients with AMCI compared with nimodipine
alone. The results also show that acupuncture is
effective as an adjunctive treatment to nimodipine for
AMCI. Due to the small number of available RCTs
and the relatively poor methodological quality of the
available evidence, further rigorously-designed studies
