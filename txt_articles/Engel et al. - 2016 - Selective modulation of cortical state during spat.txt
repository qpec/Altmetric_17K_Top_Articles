during spatial attention

Neocortical activity is permeated with endogenously generated fluctuations, but how these
dynamics affect goal-directed behavior remains a mystery. We found that ensemble neural
activity in primate visual cortex spontaneously fluctuated between phases of vigorous (On)
and faint (Off) spiking synchronously across cortical layers. These On-Off dynamics,
reflecting global changes in cortical state, were also modulated at a local scale during
selective attention. Moreover, the momentary phase of local ensemble activity predicted
behavioral performance. Our results show that cortical state is controlled locally within a
cortical map according to cognitive demands and reveal the impact of these local changes
in cortical state on goal-directed behavior.
E
ndogenous fluctuations in neocortical spik-
ing activity vary on a continuum between
synchronized and desynchronized states,
and the level of synchrony has been asso-
ciated with the overall level of arousal (1, 2).
During slow-wave sleep and anesthesia, ensem-
ble neural activity exhibits slow synchronous
transitions between periods of high activity and
quiescence. In individual neurons, these tran-
sitions manifest as alternating Down (hyper-
polarized) and Up (depolarized) phases of the
membrane potential due to, respectively, an ebb
and flow of synaptic activity (3–7). In awake
animals, these slow synchronous transitions are
less frequent, and thus, ensemble neural activity
appears less synchronized than during anesthe-
sia or slow-wave sleep (8–12). This relationship
between arousal and cortical synchrony suggests
that mechanisms controlling cortical state are
brain-wide and unrelated to neural circuits involv-
ing the selective recruitment of local populations
during goal-directed behavior. In particular, changes
in cortical state should be orthogonal to the mod-
ulations of spiking activity observed locally within
cortical maps during selective attention.
We discovered that spontaneous transitions
between episodes of vigorous (On) and faint (Off)
spiking occur synchronously across cortical lay-
ers in the visual cortex of behaving monkeys. We
recorded ensemble spiking activity in area V4 of
two rhesus macaques (G and B) with 16-channel
linear array microelectrodes (Fig. 1C, left) arranged
so that receptive fields (RFs) on all channels
largely overlapped (Fig. 1A, fig. S1, and materials
and methods 1). The On-Off transitions occurred
synchronously throughout the cortical depth
during fixation and in the absence of visual
stimulation (Fig. 1, B and C). The On and Off
episodes resembled the Up and Down phases
commonly observed during anesthesia and slow-
wave sleep (1–3) and were consistent with the large
fluctuations in cortical membrane potentials rec-
orded intracellularly in behaving monkeys (13).
To examine whether these On-Off fluctua-
tions also occur during more demanding cogni-
tive behaviors, we trained monkeys to perform a
selective attention task. Monkeys were rewarded
for detecting changes in a visual stimulus and
indicating those changes with an antisaccade
response (Fig. 1D). During each trial, a small
central cue indicated the stimulus that was most
likely to change orientation. The cued stimulus
was thus the target of covert attention, whereas
because of anticipation of antisaccadic response,
the stimulus opposite to the cue was the target
of overt attention (14). In spite of the difficulty
of the task, monkeys performed well above chance,
with 69 and 67% correct responses for monkeys
G and B, respectively. While monkeys performed
this task, we recorded from area V4 in 46 ses-
sions (25 in monkey G and 21 in monkey B). As
in the fixation task, we observed prominent On-
Off transitions occurring synchronously across
the cortical depth in both spontaneous and
stimulus-driven activity, before and after the
attention cue was presented, and evident in both
single- and multiunit activity (Fig. 1E, fig. S2,
supplementary text 3.1). On episodes reliably
followed stimulus onset on a majority of trials.
However, subsequent On-Off transitions occurred
irregularly within and across trials during the
sustained response to the stable RF stimulus.
Transitions were also irregular with respect to the
attention-cue’s onset.
To characterize the On-Off dynamics, we
counted spikes in 10-ms time bins and used a
Hidden Markov Model (HMM) as a statistically
principled way to segment spike-count data into
On and Off episodes (Fig. 2A and materials and
methods 2.2) (15, 16). An HMM was fitted to 16-
channel multiunit activity, but all analyses based
on the fitted HMM were performed on both single-
and multiunit activities, yielding highly consistent
results. The HMM has a one-dimensional, latent
variable representing an unobserved population
state that switches between two phases, On and
Off. Spikes on 16 recorded channels are assumed
to be generated by inhomogeneous Poisson pro-
cesses, with different mean rates during the On
and Off phases. When an HMM is fitted to the
spiking data, 34 parameters are estimated: firing
rates in the On and Off phases for each of 16
channels and transition probabilities pon and
poff for the entire ensemble (Fig. 2B). Using these
parameters, we can then infer the most likely
sequence of On and Off episodes that underlie
the observed spike trains on a trial-by-trial basis
(Fig. 2C). From visual inspection, On and Off
episodes inferred by the HMM were closely
aligned to the periods of vigorous and faint
spiking. These On-Off transitions in spike rates
were also phase-locked to low-frequency fluctu-
ations in the local field potential (LFP) (fig. S3
and supplementary text 3.2). On average, the
HMM captured about half of the maximal
explainable variance in the data (fig. S4 and
supplementary text 3.3). For most recording
sessions (31 total, 67%), the two-phase HMM
was the most parsimonious model among HMMs,
with 1 or up to 8 possible phases (fig. S5). These
31 sessions were therefore used in subsequent
analyses of On and Off episode durations. For
the remaining 15 (33%) sessions, a one-phase
HMM was the most parsimonious model. Con-
sistent with HMM assumptions, the durations of
On and Off episodes were distributed exponen-
tially, with the decay time constants ton and toff
given by the average On and Off episode dura-
tions (Fig. 2D and fig. S6A). The averages across
sessions of these average On and Off episode
durations were, respectively, ton = 149 ± 77 ms
and toff = 102 ± 33 ms for stimulus-driven ac-
tivity and ton = 97 ± 36 ms and toff = 118 ± 47 ms
for spontaneous activity (mean ± SD across 31
sessions) (fig. S6, B and C). We also analyzed
laminar recordings from area V4 performed with
a different type of linear electrode array, in two
different behaving monkeys, and in a different
laboratory. In this additional data set, On-Off
transitions also occurred synchronously across
cortical layers during spontaneous and stimulus-
driven activity and were equally well described
by the two-phase HMM (Fig. 2, E to G, fig. S7,
and supplementary text 3.4).
To investigate the extent to which On-Off dy-
namics reflect arousal or selective attention, we
analyzed data from the two monkeys perform-
ing the attention task. In rodents, cortical state
dynamics closely covary with global arousal, as
measured by pupil size, with dilation character-
ized by desynchronization of neural activity and
constriction by an increase in low-frequency fluc-
tuations (17, 18). Similarly, the pupil size was
positively correlated with the average duration
of On episodes on a trial-by-trial basis, during
fixation and attention (fig. S8). Thus, the On-Off
dynamics indeed reflected global changes of cor-
tical state associated with arousal. Spatial atten-
tion, on the other hand, involves the selective

three behavioral conditions to measure the local
effects of both covert and overt attention on

Monkeys initiated a trial by fixating a central dot (Fixation). After a brief delay
(333 ms and 170 ms in monkeys G and B, respectively), four peripheral
oriented-grating stimuli appeared, one in each of the screen’s quadrants
(Stimulus). After a variable delay (200 to 2 700 ms), stimuli briefly dis-
appeared (Blank, < 270 ms) then reappeared either with or without one
of them changing orientation. Monkeys reported an orientation change
by executing a saccade to the stimulus diametrically opposite to the
change location (Antisaccade; arrow indicates saccade direction). If no
change happened, monkeys had to maintain fixation (No saccade). A small,
central cue (white line; illustrated larger than actual size) appeared shortly
(200 to 500 ms) after stimulus onset (Cue), pointing toward the stimulus
that was most likely to change. (E) On and Off transitions in multiunit spiking

 global state changes, then we should not expect
On-Off dynamics to be modulated by attention.
We considered three ways in which an
attention-induced increase in mean firing rate
could co-occur with the On-Off dynamics (Fig.
3B). First, mean firing rate could be enhanced
during On phase, Off phase, or both, without
any difference in the transition dynamics across
attention conditions. This outcome would sug-
gest that the On-Off dynamics are not selective
for local neuronal populations but reflect a
global state. Second, the enhancement in the
mean firing rate could arise entirely from an
increase in the duration of On episodes, or a
decrease in the duration of Off episodes, or
both, but without any change in the firing rates
during On or Off phases. Third, a combination
of the first two scenarios is also possible: The
firing rates and durations of the On and Off
episodes could both be modulated. The last two
outcomes would both indicate that On-Off dy-
namics are locally and selectively modulated
within confined retinotopic regions and do not
solely reflect a global arousal state.
The On-Off dynamics were modulated by
attention consistent with the third scenario.
Firing rates during the On and Off phases were
slightly, but significantly, enhanced during both
types of attention [Wilcoxon signed rank test;
covert, On-phase median modulation index (MI) =
0.008, P = 0.002, Off-phase median MI = 0.005,
P = 0.046; overt, On-phase median MI = 0.014,
P < 10−5, Off-phase median MI = 0.029, P < 10−10]
(Fig. 3C and materials and methods 2.2.5). The
average duration of Off episodes was signifi-
cantly longer in the covert, but not the overt,
attention condition compared with control con-
ditions (Wilcoxon signed rank test; covert, median
change in duration 4 ms, P = 0.004; overt, median
change in duration –2 ms, P = 0.652) (Fig. 3D).
However, the average duration of On episodes
was significantly longer during both covert
and overt attention as compared with controls
(Wilcoxon signed rank test; covert, median change
in duration 7 ms, P < 10−3; overt, median change
in duration 13 ms, P < 10−4) (Fig. 3D). Correspond-
ingly, the On-Off transition frequency was signifi-
cantly lower during covert and overt attention
compared with control conditions (Wilcoxon
signed rank test; covert, median reduction in
frequency 0.2 Hz, P = 0.001; overt, median re-
duction in frequency 0.2 Hz, P < 10−3) (fig. S9A).
In separate control analyses, we confirmed that
the changes in On-Off dynamics were not an
artifact of the attention-related increase in firing
rates, or of the HMM’s assumption of discrete
On-Off phases (figs. S9 and S10 and supplemen-
tary text 3.5 and 3.6). We also considered the
influence of microsaccades. Unlike stimulus on-
set, which was reliably followed by On-episodes,
only a small fraction of transitions was preceded
by a microsaccade (fig. S11, A to D). Nonetheless,
changes in frequency or direction of miscrosac-
cades could not account for observed increases
in On-episode durations (fig. S11, E to G). More-
over, increases in On-episode durations were also
observed on trials without microsaccades (fig.
S11H and supplementary text 3.7).
Last, we asked whether On-Off dynamics, in
addition to being modulated by attention, pre-
dicted behavioral performance. In our task, the
probability of detecting a change was greater at

 the cued location as compared with uncued
locations (14). We investigated how the increase
in detection probability at the cued location was
related to On-Off dynamics (materials and meth-
ods 2.2.6). When the cued orientation change
occurred in the RFs of recorded neurons, the
probability of detecting that change was signif-
icantly greater when it occurred during an
On-phase than during an Off-phase (median
detection probability 64.8% during Off-phase,
78.3% during On-phase, difference 13.5%, P <
10−3, Wilcoxon signed rank test) (Fig. 4A). This
difference in detection probability was evident
beginning ~150 ms before the stimulus change
(Fig. 4B), which is consistent with the average
duration of On episodes. This effect was spa-
tially selective; we found no difference in detec-
tion probability between On and Off phases
when the cued change occurred outside the RFs
of recorded neurons (median detection proba-
bility difference 0.4%, P = 0.943, Wilcoxon signed

 such as spike-count correlations (23), can be
understood as arising from the On-Off dyna-
mics (fig. S12 and supplementary text 3.8). Cor-
related variability can be affected by cognitive
factors (24–26). In particular, spike-count cor-
relations can increase or decrease during selec-
tive attention (27–30), and changes in the On-Off
dynamics account for changes in spike-count
correlations during attention in our data (fig.
S13 and supplementary text 3.8.4). Recent models
parsimoniously attribute changes in spike-count
correlations during attention to fluctuations in
shared modulatory signals (31), with smaller spike-
count correlations accounted for by reduced fluc-
tuations in these modulatory signals (32). The
On-Off dynamics observed here could underlie
the apparent trial-to-trial fluctuations in shared
modulatory signals (32, 33) but can account for
within-trial fluctuations as well (fig. S12 and sup-
plementary text 3.8.5).
What mechanisms underlie the spatially and
temporally precise control of cortical state during
selective attention? Our results suggest that global
mechanisms governing cortical states may them-
selves also operate on a local scale or, alterna-
tively, may interact with separate attentional
control mechanisms operating locally. Indeed,
neuromodulators known to act on a brain-wide
scale (1, 34, 35) also mediate the effects of se-
lective attention (36) and influence circuits that
control selective attention (37). On the other hand,
cortico-cortical inputs appear to influence state
changes in a spatially targeted manner (38, 39).
Because diffuse neuromodulatory signals are in-
terspersed with topographically precise projec-
tions throughout the cortex, local modulation of
cortical state is likely to be widespread, extend-
ing to modalities beyond vision and serving many
cognitive functions.

Gliogenic LTP spreads widely in
nociceptive pathways

Learning and memory formation involve long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strength. A
fundamental feature of LTP induction in the brain is the need for coincident pre- and
postsynaptic activity. This restricts LTP expression to activated synapses only (homosynaptic
LTP) and leads to its input specificity. In the spinal cord, we discovered a fundamentally
different form of LTP that is induced by glial cell activation and mediated by diffusible,
extracellular messengers, including D-serine and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and that travel
long distances via the cerebrospinal fluid, thereby affecting susceptible synapses at remote
sites. The properties of this gliogenic LTP resolve unexplained findings of memory traces in
nociceptive pathways and may underlie forms of widespread pain hypersensitivity.
A
ctivity-dependent, homosynaptic long-term
potentiation (LTP) (1) at synapses in noci-
ceptive pathways contributes to pain am-
plification (hyperalgesia) at the site of an
injury or inflammation (2–5). Homosyn-
aptic LTP can, however, not account for pain
amplification at areas surrounding (secondary
hyperalgesia) or remote from (widespread hy-
peralgesia) an injury. It also fails to explain hy-
peralgesia that is induced independently of
neuronal activity in primary afferents—e.g., by
the application of or the withdrawal from opioids
(opioid-induced hyperalgesia) (6). Glial cells are
believed to contribute to these forms of hyper-
algesia and to LTP in nociceptive pathways (7–10).
Induction of homosynaptic LTP can be accom-
panied by LTP in adjacent, inactive synapses
converging onto the same neuron, especially early
in development. The respective molecular signals
for this heterosynaptic form of LTP are thought
to be confined within the cytoplasm of the ac-
tivated neuron, spreading tens of micrometers
only (11). We have now tested the hypothesis
that, in contrast to current beliefs, activation of
glial cells is causative for the induction of LTP at
spinal C-fiber synapses and that this gliogenic
LTP constitutes a common denominator of homo-
and heterosynaptic LTP in the spinal cord.
Our previous study revealed that selective ac-
tivation of spinal microglia by fractalkine induces
