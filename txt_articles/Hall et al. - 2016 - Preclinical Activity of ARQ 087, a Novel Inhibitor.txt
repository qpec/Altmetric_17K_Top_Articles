Abstract
Dysregulation of Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR) signaling through amplifica-
tions, mutations, and gene fusions has been implicated in a broad array of cancers (e.g.
liver, gastric, ovarian, endometrial, and bladder). ARQ 087 is a novel, ATP competitive,
small molecule, multi-kinase inhibitor with potent in vitro and in vivo activity against FGFR
addicted cell lines and tumors. Biochemically, ARQ 087 exhibited IC50 values of 1.8 nM for
FGFR2, and 4.5 nM for FGFR1 and 3. In cells, inhibition of FGFR2 auto-phosphorylation
and other proteins downstream in the FGFR pathway (FRS2α, AKT, ERK) was evident by
the response to ARQ 087 treatment. Cell proliferation studies demonstrated ARQ 087 has
anti-proliferative activity in cell lines driven by FGFR dysregulation, including amplifications,
fusions, and mutations. Cell cycle studies in cell lines with high levels of FGFR2 protein
showed a positive relationship between ARQ 087 induced G1 cell cycle arrest and subse-
quent induction of apoptosis. In addition, ARQ 087 was effective at inhibiting tumor growth
in vivo in FGFR2 altered, SNU-16 and NCI-H716, xenograft tumor models with gene amplifi-
cations and fusions. ARQ 087 is currently being studied in a phase 1/2 clinical trial that
includes a sub cohort for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma patients with confirmed FGFR2
gene fusions (NCT01752920).
Introduction
The FGFR family of tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFR1-4), and their ligands, the fibroblast
growth factors (FGFs), play an important role in multiple signal transduction pathways includ-
ing mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) phos-
pholipase Cγ (PLCγ), protein kinase C (PKC), and signal transducers and activator of
transcription (STAT). FGFR activation leads to a series of cellular signaling events including
increased cellular proliferation, differentiation, and migration [1, 2].
Dysregulation in the FGFR tyrosine kinase family has been implicated in a number of
human cancers, including cholangiocarcinoma, squamous non-small cell lung cancer
(sqNSCLC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC), gastric, breast, ovarian, endometrial, and bladder
carcinomas [1, 3–5]. In human cancers, FGFRs have been found to be dysregulated by multiple

 mechanisms, including aberrant expression, mutations, gene fusions, and amplifications [6–9].
Such genetic alterations have been implicated in the oncogenicity of several tumor models, sug-
gesting that therapeutic targeting of FGFRs may benefit cancer patients. Inhibition of FGFR in
vitro and in vivo has been shown to reduce proliferation of FGFR-dependent cancer cells and
induces cell death [3, 4, 8, 10–12]. Currently there are a number of therapeutic agents in clinical
development that either specifically target FGFRs, or target them as part of a spectrum of
kinases [13–18].
Recently there has been an increased interest in the oncogenic potential of FGFR gene
fusions in a number of cancer types including, lung, blood, brain, breast, prostate, and biliary
tract. [16, 19–25]. Examples of FGFR fusion driven cancers include: 8p11 myeloproliferative
syndrome, a rare stem cell disorder, which contains a number of FGFR1 fusions including
FGFR1OP-FGFR1 [16], and glioblastoma multiforme with FGFR3-TACC3 fusions which are
found in 3–7% of all GBM [26].
One tumor type where gene fusions appear to be particularly common (15–45%) is the
intrahepatic form of cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) [5, 20, 21, 27–32]. Cholangiocarcinoma is an
epithelial malignancy of biliary tract that is subcategorized based on its anatomic location
within the biliary tree, with the intrahepatic form arising from the intrahepatic biliary ductal
system [33]. A large number of FGFR2 gene fusions have been identified in cholangiocarci-
noma, and FGFR inhibitors have shown to be partially effective in reducing tumor burden in
patients [5, 20, 21, 27, 28]. Currently, there have been over 11 fusion partners for FGFR2 iden-
tified in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma patient samples S1 Table. Of note, FGFR2-AHCYL,
FGFR2-KIAA1598, and FGFR-PPHLN1 are novel gene fusions that have not been observed in
other cancer types [5, 20, 27, 34].
We report data on the pharmacological inhibitory functions of ARQ 087, a small-molecule
kinase inhibitor, with potent activity against the FGFR family. ARQ 087 demonstrated inhibi-
tory activity against FGFR2 amplifications and gene fusions in vitro and in vivo. In multiple
xenograft models, ARQ 087 effectively inhibited the growth of FGFR2 driven tumors.
Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents
Recombinant and FGFR2 kinase domains in the unphosphorylated state were generated
as reported previously [35]. The A2780, AN3CA, COS-1, J82, K-562, KATO-III, KG-1,
NCI-H716, RT4, SKOV-3, SNU-16, and SW-780 cells used in this study were obtained from
ATCC (Manassas, VA). The MFE-280, MFE-296, MFM-223, and RT-112 cells were acquired
from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH (Berlin, Ger-
many). All cell lines were maintained in either RMPI 1640 or DMEM in the presence of 10%
FBS in a 37°C humidified incubator with 5% CO2 and were passaged for fewer than 6 months
after being received. Re-authentication was not performed. High capacity RNA-to-DNA kit
and master mix for real time qPCR analysis were purchased from Life Technologies (Grand
Island, NY). The primary antibodies for Western blot analysis were purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA), R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), Santa Cruz Biotech-
nology (Dallas, TX), and β-actin Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). ARQ 087 was supplied by
ArQule, Inc.
Determination of Ki and mode of inhibition
Kinase inhibitory activity of ARQ 087 was determined for the recombinant FGFR1 (Cat#08133,
Carna BioScience, Kobe, Japan) or FGFR2 proteins (Cat#08134, Carna BioScience, Kobe, Japan),
utilizing a biotinylated PYK2 peptide substrate (biotin-AGAGSIESDIYAEIPDETC-NH2,

 Biopeptide, San Diego, CA), and ATP (Cat#12215226, Roche, Indianapolis, IN), with AlphaSc-
reen™ technology (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA).
ARQ 087 was titrated in DMSO utilizing a 3-fold dilution scheme, and then diluted 10-fold
further in deionized water for a final DMSO concentration of 10%. A volume (2.5 μL) of these
dilutions or vehicle was added to each well of a reaction plate (Cat#3642, Corning life sciences,
Corning, NY). FGFR1 or FGFR2 was added to assay buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 0.02 mg/mL
BSA, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mM Na3PO4, 1 mM DTT) to each well in
a volume of 17.5 μL for a final concentration of 0.50 or 0.25 nM, respectively. After a 30-minute
pre-incubation period, ATP and substrate were added in assay buffer (5 μL) for final concen-
trations of 0–1,000 μM ATP and 80 nM biotinylated-PYK2, for a final reaction volume of
25 μL. The plates were incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, and then stopped in the
dark by the addition of 10 μL stop/detection mixture prepared in assay buffer containing
EDTA, AlphaScreen™ Streptavidin Donor and P-TYR-100 Acceptor beads for final concentra-
tions of 10 mM EDTA and 500 ng/well of both AlphaScreen™ Donor and Acceptor beads.
Assay plates were incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature in the dark, and the plates
were read on a Perkin Elmer (Waltham, MA) Envision Multilabel plate reader (excitation
wavelength: 640 nm, emission wavelength: 570 nm). The effect of enzyme concentration was
applied for tight-binding inhibitors, and if necessary, the IC50 values were converted into Ki
values if the enzyme concentration was above the IC50 values under the assay conditions uti-
lized [36, 37]. The analysis was performed using the DynaFit software program (Biokin, Water-
town, MA).
Kinase auto-phosphorylation assays
FGFR kinase auto-activation activity was monitored using a continuous spectrophotometric
assay as described previously [35]. In this assay, the consumption of ATP is coupled via the
pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase enzyme pair to the oxidation of NADH, which is moni-
tored through a decrease in absorption at 340 nm. The assay mixture contained 100 mM Tris
(pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.28 mM NADH, 89 U/mL pyruvate
kinase, 124 U/mL lactate dehydrogenase and 2% DMSO. Reactions were initiated by the addi-
tion of 1 mM ATP to assay mixtures containing enzyme incubated with various concentrations
of ARQ 087 and the decrease in absorbance was monitored at 30°C using a Safire II plate reader
(Tecan Männedorf, Switzerland) Safire II plate reader. Unphosphorylated forms of FGFR1 or
FGFR2 kinase domains were titrated with increasing concentrations of ARQ 087 and inhibition
of kinase activation delay was measured.
Kinase biochemical profiling
ARQ 087 was first profiled against 298 kinases at a concentration of 0.1 μM (Carna Biosciences,
Kobe, Japan). Kinases that inhibited greater than 50% at 0.1 μM by ARQ 087 were subjected to
IC50 determination in a subsequent study (Carna Biosciences).
Cell proliferation assays
Cells were seeded at 3000–5000 cells per well with 130 μL media in 96-well tissue culture
treated plates. The cells were incubated overnight and subsequently treated with 3-fold serial
dilutions of ARQ 087 starting at 100 μM. The cells were returned to a 37°C humidified incuba-
tor for 72 hours. MTS Reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) was supplemented with a 1:20 dilution
of 0.92mg/mL phenazine methosulfate (PMS, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Thirty microli-
ters of the MTS/PMS reagent were added to each well, and the plates were incubated at 37°C
for an additional 4 hours. The absorbance was measured at 490 nM using the Victor™ or

 Envision1 microplate reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA). GI50 values were calculated using
Activity Base and XLfit™ (IDBS, Surrey, United Kingdom). Anti-proliferative cell-based tyro-
sine kinase assays for FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4, FGFR2 fusions (AFF3, TEL, BICC1,
CASP7, CCD6, CIT), FGFR3-BAIAP2L1, ARG, LCK, KIT, RET, SRC, FYN, FLT4 (VEGFR3),
LYN, PDGFR-β, FLT1 (VGFR1), PDGFR-α, IGF1R, KDR (VEGFR2), FMS (CSF1-R) and
EphA1 were conducted at Advance Cellular Dynamics (San Diego, CA).
Exogenous expression of FGFRs in COS-1 cells
COS-1 cells were transfected with mammalian expression vectors encoding full-length FGFR1,
FGFR2, FGFR3 or FGFR4 [OmicsLink AviTag ORF, M17 (GeneCopoeia, Rockville, MD) using
Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Life Technologies). Forty-eight hour post-transfec-
tion, the media were removed and replaced with fresh culture media. Cells were pre-treated
with various concentrations of ARQ 087 for 2 hours prior to being stimulated with 100 pM of a
mixture of FGF1/FGF2/FGF7 for 15 minutes. Cells were lysed and subjected to Western blot-
ting analysis as described below. The anti-AVI-tag antibody was used to detect expression of
total FGFRs (GeneCopoeia).
Cell cycle analysis
Cells were plated and incubated at 37°C overnight and subsequently treated with 0.1 μM or
1 μM of ARQ 087 for 24 or 72 hours. The cells were fixed and stained with Cycletest Plus
Reagent kit (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions,
and cell cycle profiles were analyzed using a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).
Western blotting analysis
Cells were plated in 6-well plates with 1 mL growth media per well and incubated at 37°C
overnight. The cells were treated with various concentrations of ARQ 087 for 2, 24, 48 or 72
hours followed by a 15-minute stimulation with or without 100 ng/mL of FGF1/FGF2/FGF7.
Media were removed from the each well and replaced with 150 μL of 1X E-Page Loading
buffer. Lysates were collected and transferred to 96-deep well plates and sonicated. Electro-
phoresis was performed on 4–12% Tris-Glycine gels (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) or on
E-PAGE™ gels (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Proteins were transferred to PVDF mem-
branes (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) using the BioRad Mini Trans-Blot1 system
(BioRad, Hercules, CA) for 4–12% Tris-Glycine gels (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA),
or by the iBlot1 system (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) for E-PAGE™ gels (Life Technolo-
gies, Carlsbad, CA). Membranes were blocked with either 5% (w/v) BSA in 1X TBST or
Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR, Lincoln, Nebraska) then probed with the appropriate pri-
mary antibodies overnight at 4°C. Secondary antibodies labeled with appropriate near-infra-
red dyes (LI-COR) or horseradish peroxidase (HRP, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX)
were then used. The membranes were either scanned using the Odyssey infrared scanner
(LI-COR) or developed with ECL reagents (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, Buckingham-
shire, UK) and imaged on the Fuji LAS 3000 system. When quantitation was feasible, the
intensities of the bands were quantitated using the accompanying software, and EC50 values
were determined.

 which included a licensed veterinary professional. During the conduct of the studies animal
health was monitored, and animals that lost greater than 20% body weight, or were moribund
were euthanized prior to the completion of the study. Tumor size was monitored regularly dur-
ing all xenograft studies and animals whose tumor size exceeded the maximum allowable size
(2000 mg or >20% of body weight), or interfered with the general health of the animal, were
euthanized prior to the completion of the study. Animals were euthanized by CO2 inhalation.
For the SNU-16 and NCI-H716 xenograft studies there were no unscheduled deaths. In the
BaF3-FGFR2 model there were three unscheduled deaths; two animal handling errors, and one
animal was sacrificed early for health reasons (unclear if this was drug related). Individual ani-
mal and tumor weights for all animals in this study are included with the supplemental infor-
mation S1 Appendix.
Six week old female NCr nu/nu mice (for SNU-16) or CB-17 SCID female mice (for
NCI-H716 and BaF3 models) were purchased from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY) and
allowed to acclimate for greater than 2 weeks. Mice were housed in sterile micro isolator
cages with 5 mice per cage and were received food and water ad libitum. Tumor cells were
suspended in 50% Matrigel (lot# A9618-BD, Bioscience) and sterile Hanks Balanced Salt
Solution (HBSS) for the NCI-H716 model or in HBSS alone for SNU-16. Each mouse was
implanted subcutaneously with 5x106 cells (SNU-16) or 8x106 cells (NCI-H716) or 2x106
cells (BaF3) to the upper right flank area. Tumor measurements and body weights were col-
lected two to three times per week with electronic calipers and balance. Tumor weight (mg)
was calculated from the equation: length x (width)2/2. This formula was used to calculate
tumor volume assuming unit density 1 mg = 1 mm3. Treatment was initiated when tumor
burden was between 100–200 mgs. Percent inhibition or tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was
calculated using the following formula: 100-[mean tumor value of treated / mean tumor
value of control] x 100.
For in vivo pathway inhibition studies, female NCr nu/nu mice (SNU-16) or CB17 SCID
mice (NCI-H716) with well established (~400 mg) subcutaneous tumors were given a single
oral dose of ARQ 087 or vehicle control. Plasma and tumor samples were collected 4 hours
post single dose. For all in vivo experiments, ARQ 087 was formulated in DMA: cremophor
EL: propylene glycol: 0.2 M acetate buffer, pH 5 (10:10:30:50) and administered orally. Dosing
volume for all groups was 10 mL/kg or 0.1 mL/10 g body weight.
Immunohistochemistry
Xenograft tumor tissues were collected after the 4-hour drug treatment, fixed for 16–24
hours in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) and embedded in paraffin. Immunohis-
tochemistry (IHC) was performed on the tumor tissue sections (5 μm thickness) for a panel
of biomarkers. After deparaffination and rehydration, antigen retrieval was conducted in a
decloaking chamber for 30 minutes at 95°C, followed by 10 seconds at 90°C using a 1 μM
EDTA solution pH 8.0 (Cat# S2505, Poly Scientific, Bay Shore, NY) for total FGFR2, phos-
pho-FGFR, and phospho-FRS2α; 10 mM Citrate buffer pH 6.0 (Cat# S2506, Poly Scientific,
Bay Shore, NY) for phospho-ERK. IHC was performed using an autostainer 480 (Lab
vision UK Ltd). These antibodies were diluted in 1% BSA/TBST. The sections were incubated
with primary antibody for 30 minutes and then with secondary antibody (or the polymer)
for 25 minutes at ambient temperature. Rabbit on Rodent HRP-Polymer (Cat# RMR622,
Biocare Medical, Concord, CA) or Goat anti-rabbit HRP (Cat# 111-035-144, Jackson Immu-
noResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) was used as a secondary antibody. 3,3’-diamino-
benzidine (DAB) was used as the chromogen and the slides were counter-stained with
hematoxylin after IHC.

Biochemical and kinetic data for ARQ 087
Kinase inhibition, selectivity, and mode of inhibition.
We previously reported the in sil-
ico design and characterization of 5, 6 dihydrobenzo[h]quinazolin-2-amine as a novel chemical
series of FGFR kinase inhibitors [35]. ARQ 069 Fig 1A, containing this core structure, was
shown to bind the inactive conformation of FGFR1. The crystal structure of the FGFR1/ARQ
069 complex indicated that the aminopyrimidine moiety of the core participates in a hinge
interaction and the hydrophobic region of the core stabilizes the downward G-loop conforma-
tion through non-polar interactions. ARQ 087 Fig 1B is an ATP competitive analogue of ARQ
069, which has been optimized for cellular potency and drug-like properties.
ARQ 087 is prepared as follows [38]: from (R)-4-(2-fluorophenyl)-3,4-dihydronaphthalen-
1(2H)-one, using DMF-DMA overnight at 100°C, the corresponding enaminone was prepared.
The (R,E)-2-((dimethylamino)methylene)-4-(2-fluorophenyl)-3,4-dihydronaphthalen-1(2H)-
one was reacted with 1-(3-(2-hydroxyethyl)phenyl)guanidine in ethanol under sodium ethox-
ide action, giving the corresponding substituted aminopyrimidine. The methane sulfonate was
prepared under standard conditions, giving (R)-3-((6-(2-fluorophenyl)-5,6-dihydrobenzo[h]
quinazolin-2-yl)amino)phenethyl methanesulfonate which was then subjected to the displace-
ment of the the methanesulfonate by 2-methoxyethylamine in presence of trimethylamine, giv-
ing after acidic work up, (R)-6-(2-fluorophenyl)-N-(3-(2-((2-methoxyethyl)amino)ethyl)
phenyl) -5,6-dihydrobenzo[h]quinazolin-2-amine (ARQ 087) as a HCl salt.
ARQ 087 inhibited wild-type FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 with biochemical IC50 values in
the 1.8–4.5 nM range, and FGFR4 with somewhat lower potency Table 1. To understand the
mechanism by which ARQ 087 inhibited FGFRs, kinetic experiments were performed with
ARQ 087 using FGFR1 and FGFR2 at a range of ATP concentrations, and the data were ana-
lyzed using the DynaFit software program. Michaelis-Menten graphs were generated Fig 1C,
and four inhibition modes (competitive, uncompetitive, noncompetitive, and mixed) were
evaluated using both the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian information cri-
terion (BIC) to determine the best fitting model. The ATP competitive model produced the
lowest AIC and BIC values, indicating that ARQ 087 is a competitive inhibitor of both FGFR1
and FGFR2 Fig 1C. Additionally, from the Michaelis-Menten plots, the Ki values of FGFR1 and
FGFR2 were determined to be 2.7 ± 0.2 nM and 0.68 ± 0.07 nM, respectively, demonstrating a
strong inhibitory potency of ARQ 087 for FGFR1 and FGFR2 Fig 1C.
Activation of FGFR kinases requires auto-phosphorylation on multiple tyrosine residues
[39, 40]. Inhibition of this auto-activation reaction by ARQ 087 was evaluated by titrating
increasing concentrations of ARQ 087 with unphosphorylated form of FGFR1 and FGFR2
kinases in an auto-phosphorylation assay. ARQ 087 inhibited the auto-phosphorylation of
FGFR1 and FGFR2 in a dose-dependent manner Fig 1D. This observation suggests that ARQ
087 targets the un-phosphorylated or inactive form of the kinase in addition to inhibiting the
active form, a hallmark of Type I inhibitors targeting the kinase by ATP competitive mecha-
nism [41].
Biochemical activity.
The selectivity of ARQ 087 across the kinome, was evaluated against
a panel of 298 kinases at a concentration of 0.1 μM. Among 298 kinases assayed (kinase
domain), approximately 50 (including FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3 and FGFR4) were inhibited by

 greater than 50% by ARQ 087. Examination of the IC50 values of this subset of kinases revealed
that 18 wild-type kinases (excluding FGFRs), exhibited sensitivities to ARQ 087 within a 3- to
10-fold range of the IC50 value for FGFR2 Table 1. In biochemical assays, ARQ 087 appears to
be most potent against FGFR1/2, however activity is also seen in a number of other kinases
including RET, VEGFR, and KIT Table 1. The biochemical data suggest that ARQ 087 is a
multi-kinase inhibitor that is highly potent against FGFR1/2/3.
In vitro results with ARQ 087 in cells with FGFR genetic alterations. Inhibition of
FGFRs in transfected cell lines: To determine whether ARQ 087 inhibits the phosphorylation
of FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4 in cells, we over-expressed full-length FGFR1, FGFR2,
FGFR3 and FGFR4 in COS-1 cells and examined the effect of ARQ 087 on phosphorylation of
FGFRs (there is no antibody available that specifically recognizes the phosphorylation of each
individual FGFR isoforms). We found that ARQ 087 inhibited the phosphorylation of FGFR1,
FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4 with EC50 values of < 0.123 μM, 0.185 μM, 0.463 μM, >10 μM
respectively Fig 2.
We also examined the anti-proliferative effect of ARQ 087 in a panel of Ba/F3 cell lines that
had been engineered to be dependent on individually over expressed tyrosine protein kinases
for survival, including cell lines dependent on individual FGFR isoforms and FGFR fusions.
The GI50 values for Ba/F3-FGFR1, Ba/F3-FGFR2, Ba/F3-FGFR3, and Ba/F3-FGFR4 ranged
between 232 nM and 1346 nM, with Ba/F3-FGFR2 the most sensitive cell line to ARQ 087 fol-
lowed by Ba/F3-FGFR1 and Ba/F3-FGFR3 Table 2. FGFR fusions were also examined in the
Ba/F3 system, including TEL-FGFR2, FGFR2-AAF3, FGFR2-BICC1, FGFR2-CASP7, FGFR2-
CCDC6, FGFR2-CCDC6, and FGFR3-BAIAP2L1. The GI50 values were between 39.9 nM and
1121 nM, with FGFR3-BAIAP2L1 as the most sensitive cell line Table 2.
In addition to FGFR-driven models, 15 other kinases that were potently inhibited by ARQ
087 biochemically were also investigated in the Ba/F3 engineered cell lines. These data rein-
force the biochemical data that suggests ARQ 087 does inhibit kinases outside of the FGFR
family in cellular assays. However, the majority of kinases had GI50 values above 1000 nM,
with the exception of ARG, LCK, KIT, FGFR1-2, and FGFR fusions as shown in Table 2. These
dissociation constant (Ki) of ARQ 087 for FGFR1 and FGFR2 are shown. (D) The effect of ARQ 087 on the activation of FGFR1 and
FGFR2 was examined in a continuous autophosphorylation assay.

 results demonstrate that ARQ 087 has the greatest potency in cell lines dependent on FGFR-
fusions, followed by wild-type FGFR1/2 isoforms. ARQ 087 appears to hit a number of other
kinases with equipotency to FGFR3/4.
Inhibition of FGFR pathway in cancer cell lines.
FGFR pathway inhibition was examined
in three solid tumor lines, the colorectal cancer cell line (NCI-H716), and gastric cancer cell
lines (SNU-16 and KATO-III), all these cell lines are FGFR2 amplified [10, 11, 42, 43]. As
shown in Fig 3A, ARQ 087 inhibited the phosphorylation of FGFRs in all three cell lines. Since
all three of these cell lines express high levels of FGFR2 protein (NCI-H716, SNU-16, and
KATO-III), we surmise that the pFGFR signal knockdown detected in Fig 3A was likely due to
the inhibition of pFGFR2.
We next examined the signal transduction pathways activated downstream of FGFR in
three FGFR2-dependent (NCI-H716, SNU-16, and KATO-III) cancer cell lines. ARQ 087
inhibited the phosphorylation of FGFR2 and its immediate downstream substrate, FRS2α, as
well as the phosphorylation of further downstream components MEK, ERK and AKT Fig 3B.
Fig 2. ARQ 087 inhibits FGFR phosphorylation. COS-1 cells ectopically expressing FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3 or FGFR4
were treated with the indicated concentrations of ARQ 087 for 2 hours followed by stimulation with 100 pM of FGF1/2/7 for 15
minutes. Total and phospho-FGFR was assessed by Western blot analyses. β-Actin was used as a loading control. The EC50
values of individual FGFR family members are shown.

 Based on these results, we conclude that ARQ 087 inhibits the FGFR signaling pathway in
these FGFR2 over-expressing cancer cells.
In addition, we also tested ARQ 087 in the acute myeloid leukemia cell line KG-1. This cell
line is driven FGFR1 fusion gene, FGFR1OP-FGFR1 [16]. Here we observed that ARQ 087
inhibits the phosphorylation of FGFR1OP-FGFR1 as well as the downstream marker, pERK
Fig 3C. From this we conclude that ARQ 087 is able to inhibit the FGFR signaling pathway in
this FGFR1 fusion driven cell line.
Growth inhibition in FGFR dysregulated cell lines
We then evaluated the anti-proliferative effect of ARQ 087 in a number of cell lines that
included cells with amplified FGFR, mutant FGFR, translocated FGFR, or unknown FGFR sta-
tus. ARQ 087 demonstrated good potency in cell lines with FGFR2 amplifications and fusions.
NCI-H716, SNU-16, and KG-1, were some of the most sensitive cell lines in this panel Table 3.
ARQ 087 inhibited multiple cell lines known to have FGFR1 or FGFR3 fusions including;
RT4 and RT112 (FGFR3-TACC3), SW-780 (FGFR3-BAIAP2L1), and KG-1(FGFROP2-
FGFR1), with GI50 values between 0.13 to 1.4 μM Table 3, suggesting that cell lines containing
FGFR fusions are sensitive to ARQ 087.
Fig 3. ARQ 087 inhibits the FGFR pathway in cancer cell lines. (A) NCI-H716, SNU-16, and KATO-III cells were treated with the indicated
concentrations of ARQ 087 for 2 hours, and phospho-FGFR was assessed by Western blot analyses. β-Actin was used as a loading control. (B)
NCI-H716 and SNU-16 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of ARQ 087 from 0 μM to 3 μM for 2 hours. The quantity of indicated protein
was assessed by Western blot analyses. β-Actin was used as a loading control. (C) KG-1 cells were treated with indicated concentrations of ARQ 087
for 2 hours followed by stimulation with a mixture of FGF1/FGF2/FGF7 for 15 minutes. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot to determine the
expression of phospho-FGFR, phospho-ERK, and β-actin.

 Alteration of cell cycle progression.
The mechanism by which ARQ 087 inhibits the
growth of FGFR kinase dependent cell lines was investigated. NCI-H716 and SNU-16 cells
were treated with either 0.1 μM or 1 μM of ARQ 087 for 24 or 72 hours then subjected to flow
cytometric analysis. Camptothecin, a known inhibitor of cell cycle progression was used as the
positive control in these experiments. Treatment with ARQ 087 led to an accumulation of cells
in the G1 phase cell cycle in a dose- and time-dependent manner Fig 4A and Table 4. We also
found that the sub-G1 population Fig 4A of NCI-H716 cells, increased after treatment with
1 μM of ARQ 087 Fig 4A and Table 4. To investigate whether the disruption of the cell cycle
correlated with an increase in apoptosis SNU-16 cells were treated with 1 μM of ARQ 087 for
0, 24, 48, and 72 hours, and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), cleaved PARP,
activated caspase 3, phospho-p53 were assessed by Western blotting analysis. We observed a
decrease in XIAP, and an increase in cleaved-PARP, activated-caspase 3, and pP53 Fig 4B.
Taken together, these data suggest that ARQ 087 inhibits the proliferation of FGFR amplified
cells by inducing G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
In vivo FGFR pathway inhibition.
The in vivo pharmacodynamic effect of ARQ 087 was
examined in SNU-16 tumor-bearing animals using IHC. Doses of 0, 25, 50, and 75 mg/kg of
ARQ 087 (n = 9/group) led to a reduction in phospho-FGFR, phospho-FRS2-α, and phospho-
ERK after 4 hours, while the total FGFR2 protein was unaffected by ARQ 087 treatment Fig 5.
These results indicate that ARQ 087 attenuated FGFR signaling in SNU-16 human xenograft
tumors.
In vivo efficacy in mouse xenograft models.
The in vivo anti-tumor effect of ARQ 087
was assessed in athymic mice bearing Ba/F3-FGFR2, Ba/F3-INSR, SNU-16, and NCI-H716 cell
line-derived tumors. The Ba/F3-FGFR2 and Ba/F3-INSR are transfected models. The SNU-16
cell line harbors amplified FGFR2 and contains a PDHX-FGFR2 fusion, while the NCI-H716,
also amplified for FGFR2, contains a FGFR2-COL14A1 fusion. ARQ 087 demonstrated potent
tumor growth inhibition in the Ba/F3-FGFR2 model, while failing to inhibit the growth of the
Ba/F3-INSR model Fig 6A and 6B. Meaningful (>50 TGI vs. control) tumor inhibition was
observed both cancer cell line derived xenograft models. In the SNU-16 xenograft study, treat-
ment with 75 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg achieved 83% (p = 0.002) and 69% (p = 0.013) TGI, respec-
tively Fig 6C. Partial (PR) and complete (CR) regressions also were observed in both dose

 groups. In the NCI-H716 human cecum model, 50 mg/kg and 75 mg/kg on a Q1Dx14 schedule
demonstrated significant TGI of 68% (p = 0.0001) and 96% (p = 0.0001), respectively Fig 6D.
Doses of 150 mg/kg of ARQ 087 were not well tolerated, resulting in unacceptable weight loss
and general lethargy. ARQ 087 was tolerated at 100 mg/kg QD, however weight loss (~10%)
prompted the adoption of 75 mg/kg for later studies Fig 7.
Discussion
Data presented here clearly demonstrate the preclinical and clinical activity of ARQ 087, a
potent pan-FGFR inhibitor showing multi-kinase activity. ARQ 087 inhibits FGFR kinase by
an ATP competitive mechanism, and is capable of inhibiting both the inactive and fully active
forms of the FGFR kinase. Hence, ARQ 087 delays FGFR activation by inhibiting its autopho-
sphorylation, as well as inhibition of the phosphorylated active kinase. These data prompted
further investigation of ARQ 087 using in vitro cell models with a genetically dysregulated
FGFR2 pathway.
In cellular models, ARQ 087 was shown to inhibit FGFR phosphorylation in ectopically-
expressing COS-1 cells with essentially equivalent potency for FGFR1 and FGFR2. Addition-
ally, ARQ 087 inhibited FGFR phosphorylation in FGFR2 dependent cells. FGFR2 pathway
inhibition by ARQ 087 was confirmed in multiple FGFR2 dependent cell lines further support-
ing FGFR2 as a target of ARQ 087.
Fig 5. ARQ 087 inhibits the FGFR pathway in xenograft tumors. Mice were dosed with 75 mg/kg of ARQ 087, and sacrificed at day 9
after administration Tumor samples were collected 4 hr after last dose. IHC staining of pFGFR, FGFR2, pFRS2-a and pERK were
performed from tumor tissues. The intensity of staining was scored by a veterinary pathologist and presented as mean±SEM.
Representative photomicrographs are shown.

 The functional consequence of FGFR inhibition was assessed in multiple cell systems. ARQ
087 inhibited cell proliferation in Ba/F3 transfected cells which were engineered to be depen-
dent on FGFR1-4 signaling, or on an FGFR gene fusion.
Among the cell lines that harbored FGFR fusions, amplifications, or mutations, cell lines
with FGFR-fusions were among the most sensitive to ARQ 087. Likewise, Ba/F3 cell lines
addicted to FGFR-fusions profiled better than the wild-type or mutant FGFR dependent Ba/F3
cells. Interestingly, a similar observation has been reported by Arai et al [34] and Wu et al.
[48], where the FGFR-fusion cell lines were more sensitive to FGFR inhibitor than the ampli-
fied wild-type FGFR or mutant FGFR harboring cell lines. Furthermore, a better potency of
FGFR inhibitor in cells with FGFR-fusion than wild-type or mutant is attributed to strong inhi-
bition of ERK1/2 activation in FGFR-fusion carrying cells. We observe a similar phenomenon
with FGFR-fusion harboring cells, ERK activation more potently suppressed by ARQ 087 in
both NCI-H716 and SNU-16 cells than FGFR-wild type carrying KATO-III cells Fig 3B. Col-
lectively, tumor cell lines addicted to oncogenic FGFR-fusions appear to be highly sensitive to
ARQ 087.
Further investigation of the mechanism of growth inhibition in FGFR-driven tumor cell
lines demonstrated that ARQ 087 induced an accumulation of cells in G1 phase of the cell
cycle. Further studies suggested that ARQ 087 works through an apoptotic mechanism of cell
death in the SNU-16 cell line which is FGFR2 amplified as well as harboring FGFR2 fusions.

 In vivo assessment of pharmacodynamic biomarkers four hours after a single dose of ARQ
087 in animals with FGFR2 driven tumors showed a reduction in the phosphorylation of both
FGFR and its substrate FRS2-α. Additionally the downstream marker phospho-ERK, was also
shown to decrease following ARQ 087 treatment. In FGFR2-amplified tumor models where
highly activated MAPK signaling (phospho-ERK staining) is driven by FGFR2 signaling, the
downstream markers are also strongly inhibited by ARQ 087. These data agree well with the in
vitro data demonstrating inhibition of the FGFR signaling pathway in these cell lines and
induction of an apoptotic response.
ARQ 087 demonstrated efficacy in multiple in vivo xenograft models, and was well tolerated
at doses up to 75 mg/kg. Durable partial and complete regressions were observed in both
tumor models that are driven by FGFR2 amplification and fusions (NCI-H716 and SNU-16),
and the murine transfected cell line (BaF3/FGFR2). Notably, ARQ 087 was not efficacious in a
xenograft model without dependency on FGFR2: i.e. BaF3/INSR (BaF3 cells expressing the
insulin receptor).
There are a number of FGF/FGFR targeted therapies currently in preclinical or clinical
development, including small molecule non-selective FGFR multi-kinase inhibitors, selective
FGFR inhibitors, FGFR antibodies, and FGF ligand traps [13–17]. Although there is strong pre-
clinical data to support the targeting of FGFR [43, 51], to date preclinical success has not trans-
lated into definitive clinical success. Initial trials with small molecule, both FGFR specific and
multikinase, inhibitors have shown some promising signs of antitumor response (PR/SD).
However, toxicities such as hyperphosphatemia, an on-target toxicity associated with FGFR
inhibition, as well as off-target toxicities such as hypertension and renal toxicities, commonly
associated with VEGFR inhibitors have been observed [52–55].

 The recent identification of the driver role of FGFR2 fusions in iCCA, as well as other tumor
types, provides a promising path forward in the selection of patients that may respond to FGFR
inhibitors in a clinical setting [20, 56]. The early experiences with FGFR inhibitors in the clinic
highlight the importance of defining the appropriate patient population, and including suitable
biomarker assays during clinical screening and enrollment. However, this task should become
easier as the use of next generation sequencing (NGS) and FISH becomes more routine.
In conclusion, ARQ 087 is a novel and potent FGFR inhibitor with multi-kinase activity. It
has the potential to be effective in variety of cancers driven by dysregulation of the FGFR path-
way. Preclinical results suggest that genetic alterations of the FGFR pathway—amplification,
mutation, and gene fusion, correlate with the activity of ARQ 087 in vitro and in vivo. ARQ
087 has recently completed the dose escalation part of its first in human clinical trial
[NCT01752920]. A clinical response was noted for a patient with intrahepatic cholangiocarci-
noma with a known FGFR2 fusion, additionally prolonged stable disease was observed in 10 of
61 patients, including a cholangiocarcinoma, which also had an FGFR2 fusion [57]. Full results
from this trial will be presented at a future date. Further clinical validation is ongoing with a
phase two study in FGFR2 fusion positive intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
