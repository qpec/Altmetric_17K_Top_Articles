ABSTRACT
Objective Wheat gluten and related proteins can
trigger an autoimmune enteropathy, known as coeliac
disease, in people with genetic susceptibility. However,
some individuals experience a range of symptoms in
response to wheat ingestion, without the characteristic
serological or histological evidence of coeliac disease.
The aetiology and mechanism of these symptoms are
unknown, and no biomarkers have been identified. We
aimed to determine if sensitivity to wheat in the absence
of coeliac disease is associated with systemic immune
activation that may be linked to an enteropathy.
Design Study participants included individuals who
reported symptoms in response to wheat intake and in
whom coeliac disease and wheat allergy were ruled out,
patients with coeliac disease and healthy controls. Sera
were analysed for markers of intestinal cell damage and
systemic immune response to microbial components.
Results Individuals with wheat sensitivity had
significantly increased serum levels of soluble CD14 and
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein, as well as
antibody reactivity to bacterial LPS and flagellin.
Circulating levels of fatty acid-binding protein 2 (FABP2),
a marker of intestinal epithelial cell damage, were
significantly elevated in the affected individuals and
correlated with the immune responses to microbial
products. There was a significant change towards
normalisation of the levels of FABP2 and immune
activation markers in a subgroup of individuals with
wheat sensitivity who observed a diet excluding wheat
and related cereals.
Conclusions These findings reveal a state of systemic
immune activation in conjunction with a compromised
intestinal epithelium affecting a subset of individuals
who experience sensitivity to wheat in the absence of
coeliac disease.
INTRODUCTION
Coeliac disease is an autoimmune disorder with
genetic, environmental and immunological com-
ponents. It is characterised by an immune response
to ingested wheat gluten and related proteins of rye
and barley that leads to inflammation, villous
atrophy and crypt hyperplasia in the small intestine.
Among the most common manifestations of coeliac
disease are abdominal pain, diarrhoea, weight loss,
bone disease and anaemia.1 The disease is strongly
associated with genes for the specific class II human
leucocyte antigens (HLA) DQ2 and DQ8 that are
involved in presenting specific immunogenic pep-
tides of gluten proteins to CD4+ T cells in the
small intestine.2 Transglutaminase 2 (TG2) appears
to be an important player in the disease, both as a
deamidating enzyme that can enhance the immu-
nostimulatory effect of gluten and as the target
Significance of this study
What is already known on this subject?
▸ Some individuals experience a range of symptoms in
response to the ingestion of wheat and related
cereals, yet lack the characteristic serological or
histological markers of coeliac disease.
▸ Accurate figures for the population prevalence of this
sensitivity are not available, although estimates that
put the number at similar to or greater than for
coeliac disease are often cited.
▸ Despite the increasing interest from the medical
community and the general public, the aetiology and
mechanism of the associated symptoms are largely
unknown and no biomarkers have been identified.
What are the new findings?
▸ Reported sensitivity to wheat in the absence of
coeliac disease is associated with significantly
increased levels of soluble CD14 and
lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, as well as
antibody reactivity to microbial antigens, indicating
systemic immune activation.
▸ Affected individuals have significantly elevated levels
of fatty acid-binding protein 2 that correlates with the
markers of systemic immune activation, suggesting
compromised intestinal epithelial barrier integrity.
How might it impact on clinical practice in
the foreseeable future?
▸ The results demonstrate the presence of objective
markers of systemic immune activation and gut
epithelial cell damage in individuals who report
sensitivity to wheat in the absence of coeliac disease.
▸ The data offer a platform for additional research
directed at assessing the use of the examined
markers for identifying affected individuals and/or
monitoring the response to treatment, investigating
the underlying mechanism and molecular triggers
responsible for the breach of the epithelial barrier,
and evaluating novel treatment strategies in affected
individuals.

 autoantigen in the ensuing immune response.3 The major B-cell
responses in patients with coeliac disease target native and dea-
midated gluten sequences, as well as the TG2 autoantigen.
Among these, the IgA anti-TG2 antibody is currently considered
the most sensitive and specific serological marker, whereas anti-
bodies to native gluten proteins have low specificity for coeliac
disease and have been found to be elevated in a number of
other conditions as well.4
Some individuals experience a range of symptoms in response
to ingestion of wheat and related cereals, yet lack the character-
istic serological, histological or genetic markers of coeliac
disease.5–8 The terms non-coeliac gluten sensitivity and non-
coeliac wheat sensitivity (NCWS) are generally used to refer to
this condition, which is currently understood as the collection
of non-specific symptoms in response to ingestion of gluten-
containing cereals, and the resolution of such symptoms on
removal of those foods from diet in individuals in whom coeliac
disease and IgE-mediated wheat allergy have been ruled out.9
The condition is associated with GI symptoms, most commonly
including bloating, abdominal pain and diarrhoea, as well as
certain extraintestinal symptoms, among which fatigue, head-
ache, anxiety and cognitive difficulties feature prominently.6
Accurate figures for the prevalence of NCWS are not available,
although estimates that put the number at similar to or greater
than for coeliac disease (1%) are often cited.10 11 Despite the
commonly used terminology for the condition, the identity of
the component(s) of wheat and/or related cereals responsible
for triggering the associated symptoms remains uncertain. While
recent controlled trials have indicated a prominent role for
gluten,7 12 non-gluten proteins and fermentable short-chain car-
bohydrates have also been suggested by some studies to drive
aberrant
immune
responses
or
to
be
associated
with
symptoms.13 14
The potential mechanisms behind the onset of symptoms in
NCWS remain unknown, and no biomarkers have been identi-
fied.10 However, a small number of studies point to increased
antibody reactivity to gluten proteins,5 15 16 moderately raised
intraepithelial lymphocyte numbers,5 6 17 increased intraepithe-
lial and lamina propria eosinophil infiltration5 and enhanced
expression of intestinal tight junction protein claudin 4,16
Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)16 or interferon gamma (IFNγ),17
suggesting intercellular junction and immune abnormalities in
subsets of affected individuals. Human intestinal epithelial sur-
faces are colonised by large communities of microorganisms and
are in constant contact with an abundance of highly immuno-
genic microbial products. Compromised intestinal epithelial
integrity has been linked to extensive systemic innate and adap-
tive immune responses that are a consequence of microbial
translocation
from
the
lumen
into
circulation.18
Systemic
immune activation in response to microbial translocation is a
noted component of HIV infection and IBD.19 In the current
study, we investigated (1) whether systemic immune activation
in response to translocated microbial products may be a feature
of NCWS, (2) whether such systemic immune activation is
linked to a compromised intestinal epithelium and (3) whether
the systemic immune activation or damage to the epithelium is
responsive to the elimination of wheat and related cereals from
diet.
METHODS
Patients and controls
The study included 80 individuals with NCWS who met the cri-
teria recently proposed by an expert group20 and who were
identified using a previously described structured symptom
questionnaire21 22 (a modified version of the Gastrointestinal
Symptom Rating Scale designed to rate symptoms commonly
associated with NCWS). All NCWS subjects reported experien-
cing intestinal and/or extraintestinal symptoms after ingestion of
gluten-containing foods, including wheat, rye or barley. The
reported symptoms in all subjects improved or disappeared
when those foods were withdrawn for a period of 6 months,
and recurred when they were re-introduced for a period of up
to 1 month. Individuals were excluded if they were already on a
restrictive diet in the past 6 months, if they were positive for the
coeliac disease-specific IgA anti-endomysial and/or anti-TG2
autoantibody or for intestinal histological findings characteristic
of coeliac disease, or if they were positive for wheat allergy-
specific IgE serology or skin prick test. A total of six intestinal
biopsies, including two from the duodenal bulb and four from
the distal duodenum, were taken from each individual. Serum
samples from all 80 NCWS subjects while on a diet that con-
tained wheat, rye and/or barley were available. In addition to
the above specimens, serum samples were available from 20 of
the above NCWS individuals both before and after 6 months of
a self-monitored diet free of wheat, rye and barley. These indivi-
duals were asked to complete the previously described question-
naire22 before initiating the diet and immediately following its
completion. For this study, specific intestinal symptoms (bloat-
ing, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, epigastric pain and nausea) and
extraintestinal symptoms (fatigue, headache, anxiety, memory
and cognitive disturbances, and numbness in arms or legs),
selected on the basis of being the most commonly reported
symptoms by patients in this population as previously found,6
were considered for analysis. Symptoms were scored from 0 to
3 as follows: 0=absent, 1=occasionally present, 2=frequently
present and 3=always present. A total score, based on the sum
of individual symptom scores, was calculated for each individual
at the two time points (before and after the diet). The study also
included 40 serum samples from patients with biopsy-proven
active coeliac disease and 40 serum samples from healthy sub-
jects (both groups on normal non-restrictive diet), recruited as
part of the same protocol that included the NCWS individuals.
All cases of coeliac disease were biopsy proven and diagnosed
according to established criteria.23 Screening questionnaires
were used to evaluate the general health of unaffected controls.
Individuals who had a history of liver disease, liver function
blood test results (aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase,
alkaline phosphatase, total protein, albumin, globulin and biliru-
bin) outside the normal range or a recent infection were
excluded from all cohorts in the study.
All samples were collected with written informed consent
under institutional review board-approved protocols at St.
Orsola-Malpighi Hospital, Bologna, Italy. Serum specimens were
kept at −80°C to maintain stability. This study was approved
by the institutional review board of Columbia University
Medical Center.
Assays
Established serological markers of coeliac disease, including IgA
antibody to TG2 and IgG and IgA antibodies to deamidated
gliadin, were measured as previously described.24 25
Serum IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies to native gliadin were
measured separately by ELISA as previously described,24 26 with
the following modification: the secondary antibodies were
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-human IgG (GE
Healthcare), IgA (MP Biomedicals) or IgM (MP Biomedicals).
Serum IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies to bacterial flagellin were
measured separately using a similar protocol for detecting

 antibodies to gliadin, with the following modification: plates
were coated with a 2 μg/mL solution of highly purified flagellin
from Salmonella typhimurium (InvivoGen).
Levels of serum IgG, IgA and IgM endotoxin-core antibodies
(EndoCAb) (Hycult Biotech), lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding
protein (LBP) (Hycult Biotech), soluble CD14 (sCD14) (R&D
Systems) and fatty acid-binding protein 2 (FABP2) (R&D
Systems) were determined by ELISA, according to the manufac-
turers’ protocols.
Data analysis
Group differences were analysed by the Kruskal-W
allis one-way
analysis of variance, with post hoc testing and correction for
multiple comparisons. Correlation analysis was performed using
Spearman’s r. A multivariate principal component analysis
(PCA) was carried out on the entire dataset to reduce data
dimensionality and to assess clustering. The effect of the restrict-
ive diet was assessed by the Wilcoxon matched-pairs test. All
p values were two sided, and differences were considered statis-
tically significant at p<0.05. Statistical analyses were performed
with Prism 6 (GraphPad) and Minitab 17 (Minitab) software.
RESULTS
Patients and controls
The demographic and clinical characteristics of the study
cohorts are included in table 1. T
wenty-one (26%) NCWS in-
dividuals expressed HLA DQ2 and/or DQ8, a rate not substan-
tially different than in the general population. Small intestine
duodenal biopsy showed a normal mucosa (Marsh 0) in 48
(60%) and mild abnormalities, represented by an increased
intraepithelial lymphocyte number (Marsh 1) in 32 (40%). In
contrast, all patients with coeliac disease in this study expressed
HLA DQ2 and/or DQ8 and presented with Marsh 3 grade
intestinal histological findings.
Markers of coeliac disease and immune reactivity to gluten
The active coeliac disease cohort exhibited significantly elevated
IgA antibody reactivity to TG2, as well as IgG and IgA antibody
reactivity to deamidated gliadin, when compared with healthy
controls
(p<0.0001
for
each
comparison)
(figure
1A–C).
Patients with coeliac disease also displayed increased IgG and
IgA (p<0.0001 for each), but not IgM, antibody reactivity to
native gliadin when compared with healthy controls (figure 1D–
F). In the NCWS cohort (while being on a diet that did not
restrict the intake of wheat and related cereals), IgG, IgA and
IgM antibodies to native gliadin were all significantly higher
than in the healthy control group (p<0.0001, p<0.0001 and
p=0.018, respectively) (figure 1D–F). However, IgA reactivity to
native gliadin in this NCWS cohort was lower than in the
coeliac disease group (p=0.015). There was no association
between antibody reactivity to native gliadin and the presence
of HLA DQ2 and/or DQ8 genotypes in the NCWS group.
Systemic innate immune activation
Serum levels of both LBP and sCD14 were significantly elevated
in individuals with NCWS in comparison with patients with
coeliac disease and healthy individuals (p<0.0001 for each
comparison) (figure 2A, B). There was a highly significant cor-
relation between serum LBP and sCD14 (r=0.657, p<0.0001)
(see online supplementary figure S1). Neither LBP nor sCD14
was found to be significantly elevated in patients with coeliac
disease when compared with healthy controls.
B-cell response to microbial antigens
When compared with the healthy control and coeliac disease
cohorts, the NCWS group had significantly higher levels of
EndoCAb IgM (p<0.0001 and p=0.028, respectively) (figure 2D),
but not IgG or IgA (see figure 2C and online supplementary
figure S2A). In contrast to the NCWS cohort, the coeliac disease
group had higher levels of EndoCAb IgA when compared with
the NCWS and healthy control groups (p=0.021 and p=0.032,
respectively) (see online supplementary figure S2A), but not IgG
or IgM (figure 2C, D).
Furthermore, the levels of IgG and IgM antibodies to flagellin
were significantly elevated in the NCWS cohort when compared
with the healthy control group (p=0.001 and p=0.009,
respectively) (figure 2E, F). These antibodies were not signifi-
cantly elevated in the coeliac disease cohort, although there was
a trend towards higher IgA reactivity to flagellin when compared
with healthy controls (p=0.059) (see online supplementary
figure S2B). The increased IgM antibody response to flagellin cor-
related with the elevated EndoCAb IgM in the NCWS cohort
(r=0.386, p<0.0001) (see online supplementary figure S3).
Systemic immune activation is associated with increased
intestinal epithelial cell damage
In comparison with the healthy control group, serum concentra-
tions of FABP2, a marker of intestinal epithelial cell damage,
were significantly elevated in the NCWS cohort, as well as in
the coeliac disease group (p<0.0001 for each) (figure 3A). In
addition, the FABP2 concentrations in the NCWS cohort corre-
lated with levels of LBP (r=0.360, p=0.001) and sCD14
(r=0.461, p<0.0001) (figure 3B, C). The FABP2 concentrations
in the NCWS group also correlated with EndoCAb IgM
(r=0.305, p=0.003) and anti-flagellin IgM antibody reactivity
(r=0.239,
p=0.033)
in
the
NCWS
cohort
(see
online
supplementary figure S4A, B). In the coeliac disease cohort,
FABP2 concentrations correlated with the levels of IgA anti-
body to TG2 (r=0.559, p<0.0001) (see online supplementary
figure S5).

 Multivariate analysis of dataset
PCA was used to assess similarities and differences between the
subjects in the three cohorts based on the generated data and to
determine whether they can be grouped. Most of the variability
in the data could be explained by the first two components
(54%). The score plot of the first and second components for
the entire dataset demonstrated the clustering of the healthy
control, coeliac disease and NCWS subjects into three discern-
ible groups, with some outliers (figure 4).
Systemic immune activation and intestinal epithelial cell
damage respond to dietary restriction
Levels of the above markers of immune activation and gut epi-
thelial cell damage were also measured in 20 of the above
NCWS subjects before and 6 months after initiation of a diet
free of wheat, rye and barley. All individuals reported symptom
improvement at the end of 6 months, which was reflected in a
significant reduction in both the intestinal and extraintestinal
composite symptom scores (p<0.0001 for each) (figure 5A, B),
accompanied by a decline in IgG, IgA and IgM anti-gliadin
antibodies (p<0.0001, p=0.002 and p=0.004, respectively)
(figure 5C–E). In conjunction with this, we found a statistically
significant reduction in the serum levels of LBP (p=0.0002),
sCD14 (p=0.0006), EndoCAb IgM (p=0.006), anti-flagellin
IgG and IgM antibodies (p=0.002 and p=0.003, respectively)
and FABP2 (p=0.003) after the completion of the diet
(figure 6A–F). The magnitude of change in the measured bio-
logical markers did not correlate significantly with that for the
symptom scores.
DISCUSSION
As expected, the cohort of individuals with sensitivity to wheat
in the absence of coeliac disease did not exhibit significantly
elevated antibody responses to TG2 or deamidated gliadin
sequences. This indicates that in contrast to coeliac disease, the
observed humoral immune response to gluten in NCWS is inde-
pendent of TG2 enzymatic activity and HLA-DQ2/DQ8, and is
likely to target certain epitopes that are distinct from those in
coeliac disease. W
e hypothesised that the enhanced antibody
response to native gliadin in NCWS individuals, particularly
IgG and IgM isotypes, may be a consequence of ongoing intes-
tinal epithelial barrier defects. If so, such defects might also give
rise to an inadequate regulation of the interaction between the
gut microbiota and systemic circulation, resulting in peripheral
immune activation. To examine this, we measured the levels
of LBP and sCD14 as indicators of the translocation of micro-
bial products, particularly LPS, across the epithelial barrier.
Translocated circulating LPS can result in the rapid secretion of
LBP by GI and hepatic epithelial cells, as well as sCD14 by
CD14+ monocytes/macrophages.19 sCD14 binds LPS in the
presence of LBP to activate TLR4.27 W
e found significantly ele-
vated serum levels of both LBP and sCD14 in individuals with
NCWS in comparison with patients with coeliac disease and
healthy controls. The high degree of correlation between serum
LBP and sCD14 suggested that these molecules are concurrently
expressed in response to the stimulus in NCWS individuals.
W
e also quantified serum levels of antibody to LPS core oligosac-
charide, or EndoCAb, which is known to modulate in response to
bacterial endotoxin in circulation.28 As they are involved in the
neutralisation of circulating endotoxin, EndoCAb immunoglobulins

eventually
rise
due
to
the
B-cell
anamnestic
response.19
Individuals in the NCWS cohort exhibited increased levels of
EndoCAb IgM. To demonstrate that the systemic immune
response in individuals identified as having NCWS would not
be limited to only LPS if driven by translocated microbial pro-
ducts, we also measured serum levels of antibody to flagellin,
the
principal
substituent
protein
of
the
flagellum
in
Gram-positive and negative bacteria. W
e found that levels of
IgG and IgM antibodies to flagellin were significantly elevated
in the NCWS cohort. Considering that no individuals in this
study had evidence of infection, these observations are suggest-
ive of a translocation of microbial products from the GI tract
that contributes to the observed innate and adaptive immune
activation in the NCWS cohort.
Circulating bacterial components, such as LPS and flagellin,
bind to their respective TLRs on various cells, including macro-
phages and dendritic cells, which results in signalling through
the
myeloid
differentiation
factor
88
(MyD88)
adaptor
protein.27 Ultimately, MyD88 signalling leads to the activation
of transcription factor nuclear factor-κB and increased expres-
sion of various proinflammatory cytokines that can exert
deleterious systemic effects.19 29 A systemic innate immune acti-
vation model would be consistent with the generally rapid onset
of reported symptoms in NCWS.6 In addition, circulating
microbial products can bind to TLRs on other cells to trigger a
more localised inflammatory response. For example, LPS binds
directly to TLR4 on the luminal surface of brain blood vessels,
resulting in local cytokine secretion in the brain that has been
shown to activate the microglia to displace inhibitory synap-
ses.30 In HIV infection, where the presence of microbial trans-
location is linked to intestinal epithelial damage, increased
systemic immune activation in response to bacterial antigens is
associated with cognitive deficits.31 Such a pathway might con-
tribute to some of the neurocognitive symptoms experienced by
NCWS individuals.
Subsequently, we considered whether the observed systemic
immune activation in response to microbial products in indivi-
duals with NCWS may be linked to increased intestinal entero-
cyte damage and turnover rate. FABP2 is a cytosolic protein
specific to intestinal epithelial cells that is rapidly released into
systemic circulation after cellular damage.32 Alterations in circu-
lating FABP2 concentration, reflecting epithelial cell loss and
changes in enterocyte turnover rate, are useful for identifying
acute intestinal injury.32–35 Elevated circulating FABP2 has been
shown to be associated with increasing degrees of villous
atrophy in coeliac disease,36 and with microbial translocation in
HIV37 that is in turn linked to damaged intestinal epithelial
barrier integrity.18 Similar to the patients with coeliac disease,
the NCWS individuals in this study were found to have raised
circulating FABP2 levels, indicating increased intestinal epithelial
cell damage. FABP2 concentrations in the NCWS cohort corre-
lated strongly with levels of LBP and sCD14, suggesting a link
between the intestinal epithelial cell damage and the acute sys-
temic immune activation in response to translocated microbial
products. The FABP2 concentrations in the NCWS group also
correlated with IgM antibody reactivity towards microbial anti-
gens, though less strongly in comparison with LBP and sCD14
responses, as might be expected for a systemic antibody
response. In the coeliac disease cohort, FABP2 concentrations
correlated with the increased IgA antibody to TG2, confirming
the existence of a close relationship between the mucosal auto-
immune response and the intestinal damage in this disease.
In contrast to coeliac disease, however, investigations of small
intestine biopsies in NCWS subjects in this and other studies
have not found villous atrophy or mucosal architectural abnor-
malities,5 6 21 38 even if significant inflammatory changes are
seen.5 One possible explanation for this could be that the epi-
thelial damage associated with NCWS is in regions other than
the duodenum from where biopsies are generally taken in such
individuals. This would be plausible because FABP2 is expressed
primarily by the epithelial cells of the jejunum,33 39 which may
point to this region of the small intestine as a potential primary
site of mucosal damage in NCWS. Different sections of the GI
tract have unique cellular, structural and immunological features
that make them vulnerable to specific insults.40 Another possi-
bility is that the epithelial changes associated with NCWS might
be more subtle in comparison with coeliac disease, without
overt remodelling of the mucosa. For example, tumour necrosis
factor (TNFα)-mediated enhancement of enterocyte loss has
been shown to cause mucosal barrier dysfunction and physical
gaps in the epithelium that require confocal and scanning elec-
tron microscopy for visualisation.41
On the other hand, despite the established extensive villous
damage associated with coeliac disease, neither LBP nor sCD14
levels were found to be significantly elevated in the coeliac

 disease group, thus standing in stark contrast to the NCWS
cohort. In addition, among the immunoglobulin responses to
microbial antigens, only IgA antibodies appeared to be increased
in coeliac disease. These data suggest that there is an effective
mechanism for the neutralisation of microbial products that may
cross into the lamina propria in most cases of coeliac disease,
possibly in part via the localised IgA response and mucosal
phagocytic cells. These mechanisms are known to be essential
for the immune surveillance of luminal antigens and the elimin-
ation of microbial products that cross the epithelial barrier,
thereby reducing the likelihood of their translocation into the
submucosa and access to blood vessels.19 Such mucosal immune
responses may be lacking or inadequate in individuals with
NCWS.
Instead,
what
we
observed
were
enhanced
IgM
responses to gliadin, LPS and flagellin in the NCWS cohort,
which clearly contrasted with the coeliac disease group. In
humans, IgM memory B cells are present in the peripheral
blood and contribute to the expression of IgM antibodies to a
diverse variety of antigens, offering a first line of defence
against potential pathogens.42 Exposure to unmethylated CpG
sequences, which are abundant in the bacterial and viral
genomes, can result in TLR9-dependent proliferation and differ-
entiation of these B cells, independent of direct interaction with
their respective antigens or T-cell involvement.43 Acute micro-
bial translocation from the gut, as the data from our study
suggest, would be expected to enhance the secretion of IgM
antibodies in the periphery via this pathway. These IgM B cells
would be additionally stimulated on encounter with specific
antigens, such as the translocated microbial components or
gliadin sequences, and may contribute to the observed IgM anti-
body responses.43 44 Recognition and agglutination of antigens
by IgM and IgG antibodies can result in the activation of the
classical complement pathway and Fc receptor-mediated endo-
cytosis by macrophages,45 further contributing to the ongoing
systemic immune response.
The hallmark of NCWS is the onset of intestinal and/or extra-
intestinal symptoms on ingestion of gluten-containing foods,
that is, wheat, rye and barley, and the alleviation of symptoms
on their withdrawal from diet. To determine whether the
patient-reported symptom resolution on the elimination of these
foods would be associated with the amelioration of intestinal
epithelial cell damage and a reduction in microbial translocation
and systemic immune activation, we examined the above
markers in a subset of NCWS subjects before and after a diet
that excluded wheat and related cereals. The results indicated a
significant decline in the markers of immune activation and gut
epithelial cell damage, in conjunction with the improvement of
symptoms. However, the magnitude of change in the measured
biological markers did not correlate significantly with that for
the symptom scores. This appears to be similar to observations
in patients with coeliac disease, where symptoms are known to
be a poor predictor of disease activity and associated biomar-
kers.46 47 A limitation of this portion of the study was the
absence of a healthy control group to assess the potential impact
of the dietary restriction in unaffected individuals.
In summary, the results of this study on individuals with sensi-
tivity to wheat in the absence of coeliac disease demonstrate (1)
significantly increased serum levels of sCD14 and LBP
, as well as
antibody reactivity to microbial antigens, indicating systemic
immune activation; (2) an elevated expression of FABP2 that
correlates with the systemic immune responses to bacterial pro-
ducts, suggesting compromised intestinal epithelial barrier integ-
rity and increased microbial translocation; and (3) a significant

 change towards normalisation in the levels of the immune acti-
vation markers, as well as FABP2 expression, in response to the
restrictive diet, which is associated with improvement in symp-
toms. Our data establish the presence of objective markers of
systemic immune activation and epithelial cell damage in the
affected individuals. The results of the multivariate data analysis
suggest that a selected panel of these may have use for identify-
ing patients with NCWS or patient subsets in the future. It is
important to emphasise that this study does not address the
potential mechanism or molecular trigger(s) responsible for
driving the presumed loss of epithelial barrier integrity and
microbial translocation. Further research is needed to investigate
the mechanism responsible for the intestinal damage and breach
of the epithelial barrier, assess the potential use of the identified
immune markers for the diagnosis of affected individuals and/or
monitoring the response to specific treatment strategies, and
examine potential therapies to counter epithelial cell damage
and systemic immune activation in affected individuals.
