AbsTrACT 
Introduction lung cancer outcomes in england are 
inferior to comparable countries. Patient or disease 
characteristics, healthcare-seeking behaviour, diagnostic 
pathways, and oncology service provision may contribute. 
We aimed to quantify associations between geographic 
variations in treatment and survival of patients in 
england.
Methods We retrieved detailed cancer registration 
data to analyse the variation in survival of 176,225 lung 
cancer patients, diagnosed 2010-2014. We used Kaplan-
Meier analysis and cox proportional hazards regression 
to investigate survival in the two-year period following 
diagnosis.
results Survival improved over the period studied. the 
use of active treatment varied between geographical 
areas, with inter-quintile ranges of 9%–17% for surgical 
resection, 4%–13% for radical radiotherapy, and 
22%–35% for chemotherapy. at 2 years, there were 
188 potentially avoidable deaths annually for surgical 
resection, and 373 for radical radiotherapy, if all treated 
proportions were the same as in the highest quintiles. 
at the 6 month time-point, 318 deaths per year could be 
postponed if chemotherapy use for all patients was as in 
the highest quintile. the results were robust to statistical 
adjustments for age, sex, socio-economic status, 
performance status and co-morbidity.
Conclusion the extent of use of different treatment 
modalities varies between geographical areas in england. 
these variations are not attributable to measurable 
patient and tumour characteristics, and more likely reflect 
differences in clinical management between local multi-
disciplinary teams. the data suggest improvement over 
time, but there is potential for further survival gains if the 
use of active treatments in all areas could be increased 
towards the highest current regional rates.
InTroduCTIon
Lung cancer is a major burden of cancer morbidity 
and mortality in England.1 Survival from lung 
cancer has been lower in England than in compa-
rable countries,2 3 but there are indications of 
improving survival in recent years, possibly linked 
to more active treatment.3–7
Early diagnosis of lung cancer is important and 
patients with localised cancers have a much greater 
chance of radical treatment and long-term survival.8 
Recent papers have shown that the use of the fast-
track 2 
week referral route from the general prac-
titioner to the diagnostic and oncology services 
is associated with favourable stage distribution 
and with higher survival of cancer patients.9–11 
Conversely, long waiting times for treatment are 
associated with stage progression.12 13
There remain important variations in lung cancer 
outcomes linked to region of residence, hospital of 
first attendance, socio-economic position, co-mor-
bidity, tumour stage, histological type, and biolog-
ical markers of prognosis, and there are separate 
variations in relation to local patterns of oncology 
treatment and care provision.14–17
The aim of this study was to assess the magnitude 
of variation in the use of active treatments for lung 
cancer, and to identify potential opportunities to 
reduce variation and improve outcomes.
dATA And MeThods
From the Cancer Analysis System in Public Health 
England, we extracted cancer registration data 
on patients with primary lung cancer, diagnosed 
between 2005 and 2014. If a person had more than 
one primary lung cancer, only the first record was 
considered.
Age at diagnosis, sex, topography (the anatomic 
location of the primary tumour), histology (the cell 
Key messages
What is the key question?
 
► Is the local variation in lung cancer treatment in 
England associated with patient survival?
What is the bottom line?
 
► Variations in the use of surgical resection, 
radical radiotherapy and chemotherapy are 
each associated with the survival of patients in 
the relevant stage groups.
Why read on?
 
► If these results are appreciated among 
clinicians in lung cancer multi-disciplinary 
teams, and treatment rates are increased 
towards the currently highest levels, more than 
800 lung cancer patients each year could have 
a clinically relevant extension of their lives.

type of the cancer), performance status and tumour stage were 
retrieved from the cancer registration records. Socio-economic 
status was taken as the quintile of the index of multiple depri-
vation 2010, based on the local area of residence at the time of 
cancer diagnosis.18 Co-morbidity was assessed by the Charlson 
co-morbidity index, derived from hospital discharge diagnosis 
from in-patient hospital admissions in the 2 
year period from 27 
months to 3 
months before cancer diagnosis.19–21
Unspecified codes for performance status, topography, 
histology and stage were retained as separate categories in the 
analysis. Performance status data were only available in the 
period 2010–2012. Persons with no in-patient hospital activity 
in the relevant period were assigned a co-morbidity score of zero.
At the level of the individual patient, the initial active cancer 
treatments (surgical resection; radical radiotherapy; chemo-
therapy) were derived from surgical procedure codes in Hospital 
Episode Statistics data, or from treatment tables in the Cancer 
Analysis System (radiotherapy; chemotherapy). The periods 
of treatment were from the month before cancer diagnosis to 
6 
months after for surgery and chemotherapy, and from 3 
months 
before diagnosis to 12 months after for radiotherapy.
We used Primary Care Trust (PCT) organisation areas for 
the geographical analysis of treatment rates (the proportion 
of patients given particular treatments). There were 151 PCT 
organisations operating in England in the period 2006–2013 
with an average population of 3 
42 
000 people.

Lung cancer
The proportions of patients with different initial treatments 
were computed for each PCT area, and patients were thereafter 
grouped into quintiles based on PCT-level treatment rates.
Radiotherapy data were not available in 2014 and patients 
diagnosed in this year were assigned ‘not known’ codes for 
radiotherapy. Radical radiotherapy was assigned to patients in 
whom there was evidence from administration of 15 or more 
fractions of radiation.
We used Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to compute the 
cumulative risk of death from any cause at one, two and 5 
year 
time-points after diagnosis for patients diagnosed in the period 
2005–2014.
We did a cohort analysis to compute relative rates of death 
from any cause in the person-years experience from lung cancer 
diagnosis to death or censoring at 2 
years of follow-up. This was 
implemented with Cox regression models. In models of chemo-
therapy, the HR was not constant over the 2 
year follow-up 
period, and we therefore present hazard ratios computed over 
the initial 6 
month period.
In the geographical analysis, the survival outcome was esti-
mated for the entire patient population, regardless of individual 
treatments. The geographical treatment rate hereby serves as 
an ‘instrumental variable’22 and this has the potential to avoid 
the strong selection bias (‘confounding by indication’) that is 
inevitable if comparison is made directly between treated and 
untreated patients. Regression models were stratified by cancer 
stage, and in subsequent sensitivity analyses we did further 
adjustments for socio-economic status, performance status, 
co-morbidity, topography and histology. Sensitivity analyses of 
performance status were restricted to the period 2010–2012.
For selected models we used a shared frailty random effects 
model in order to account for the hierarchical nature of the data, 
with groups of patients belonging to the same PCT area. The 
results from the shared frailty models were in all cases virtually 
identical to the single-level models and results are, therefore, 
presented for the single-level models only.
To give an appreciation of the absolute magnitude of effects, we 
did a Kaplan-Meier analysis of patients in the relevant stage cate-
gories and compared survival of these patients in the quintiles of 
the geographical treatment rates. From the cumulative survival 
to the 2 
year time point (surgery and radical radiotherapy) or the 
6 
month time-point (chemotherapy), we computed the approxi-
mate number of ‘avoidable deaths’, that is  the number of deaths 
that could potentially be postponed beyond the 2 
year or the 
6 
month time-point, if all patients had the same survival as those 
in the highest quintile of treatment rate.
In order to visualise the shapes of the relationships between 
the geographical treatment rates and the survival of patients 
in the relevant stage groups, we extended the five categories 
(quintiles) to 15 categories, and fitted quadratic functions to the 
resulting hazard ratios.
resuLTs
We retrieved data on 3 
44 
825 persons who were resident in 
England with a first record of lung cancer (ICD10 C33 or C34) 
in the period 2005–2014 (figure 1). Data cleaning eliminated 
9327 death-certificate-only registrations (2.7%) and small 
numbers of records with unknown vital status or date-sequence 
errors (for example when the recorded date of diagnosis was 
after the date of death). More detailed analyses were restricted 
to the period 2010–2014 (1 
76 
225 persons). At the time when 
these data were retrieved and prepared for analysis, radiotherapy 
data were not available for the year 2014, and persons diagnosed 
in 2014 (36 516) were assigned a missing value for radiotherapy. 
Similarly, performance status was only available for 2010–2012, 
and patients diagnosed in 2013–2014 were assigned a missing 
value for performance status.

increased by one percentage point per year, from 26% in 2005 
to 36% in 2014.
Table 1 gives an overview of the person and tumour character-
istics of the 1 
76 
225 persons diagnosed in 2010–2014. In these 
recent data, tumour stage was recorded in 77% of the cases. The 
table also shows the tabulation of the individual cancer treat-
ments administered at the time of diagnosis: surgical resection 
(13.1%), radical radiotherapy (8.1% of cases diagnosed in 2010–
2013), and chemotherapy (28.7%). Of note, 48% of patients 
receiving radical radiotherapy also had chemotherapy, and 23% 
of the surgically resected patients also had chemotherapy.
Table 2 shows the geographical variation in the use of treat-
ment modalities, represented by the quintiles of the distribu-
tions. Surgical resection varied from 9.3% of patients in the 
lowest quintile to 17.2% in the highest. Radical radiotherapy 
varied similarly between 4.0% and 12.9%, and chemotherapy 
varied between 21.6% and 34.5%.
Table 3A shows the analysis of all-cause mortality in rela-
tion to the geographical quintile of the PCT-level distribution 
of the use of surgical resection. The basic model was adjusted 
for age and sex (these adjustments did not change the estimates 
importantly, compared with the crude model). The HR was 0.84 
(0.83–0.86) in the highest quintile compared with the lowest, 
and the statistical trend over the five quintiles was highly statisti-
cally significant. Exclusion of small-cell cancers from the analysis 
did not change this result. An analysis stratified by stage showed 
that the association between surgical resection and survival was 
largely restricted to patients with Stage I or II lung cancer (HR 
0.80 (0.75–0.84) in highest vs lowest quintile). Further anal-
yses showed that the association in Stage I and II patients was 
not confounded by socio-economic status, performance status, 
co-morbidity or the anatomic site of the cancer, but there was a 
small degree of confounding by tumour histology (fully adjusted 
model, HR 0.84 (0.80–0.89) between the extreme quintiles). 
The confounding by histology was due to a higher completeness 
of the recording of specific histology information in geograph-
ical areas with high surgical resection rates.
Figure 3A shows the Kaplan-Meier survival functions for 
Stage I and II patients in the five quintiles of resection rate. The 
variation in survival at the 2 
year time-point was 8.5% points 
difference between the extreme quintiles. In absolute terms, 
the variability between the five quintiles corresponds to about 
188 (95%CI 177 to 200) avoidable deaths per year at the 2 
year 
survival time-point. This is the number of potentially avoidable

deaths if all lung cancer patients in Stage I and II had the same 
survival as those in the highest quintile of surgical resection.
Table 3B shows the analysis of the geographical variation 
in radical radiotherapy. As for surgical resection, there was a 
statistically significant trend with higher survival in areas with 
high use of radical radiotherapy (HR 0.94 (0.92–0.95)) in the 
highest vs. the lowest quintile. Stratification by stage showed 
that the association was largely restricted to patients with Stage 
III cancer and patients with no record of stage, and these two 
groups were therefore combined. The estimate of 0.88 (0.85–
0.90) for the highest vs. the lowest quintile was not confounded 
by socio-economic status, performance status, co-morbidity or 
tumour histology, but adjustment for the anatomic location of 
the tumour changed the estimate slightly to 0.92 (0.89–0.95). 
The confounding was due to a higher proportion of cases with 
unspecified anatomic site in geographical areas with low use of 
radical radiotherapy.
Figure 3B shows the Kaplan-Meier survival functions for 
patients with Stage III and patients with no record of stage in 
relation to the quintile of radical radiotherapy use. At the 2 
year 
time-point, the difference between the extreme quintiles was 4.3 
percentage points and the number of deaths potentially avoid-
able at the 2 
year time-point was 373 (355-391) per year.
Table 3C shows the association between use of chemotherapy 
and patient survival in the 6 
months following diagnosis. The 
HR was 0.90 (0.88–0.91) in the highest versus the lowest quin-
tile of chemotherapy use. The survival gradient was largely due 
to an association with survival of stage IV patients (HR 0.90 
(0.87–0.92)). This was not confounded by socio-economic 
group, performance status, co-morbidity or anatomic site of 
the primary cancer, but there was a degree of confounding 
(adjusted HR 0.94 (0.91–0.97)) due to less complete recording 
of histology in geographical areas with low use of chemotherapy.
Figure 3C shows the Kaplan-Meier survival function for Stage 
IV patients in the quintiles of chemotherapy use. The functions 
were separated by 4.6 percentage points at the 6 
month time 
point, but converged towards the 2 
year time-point. The number 
of potentially avoidable deaths at 6 months was 318 (302-333).
dIsCussIon
Principal findings
We have shown a striking variation in patterns and rates of 
treatment for lung cancer across geographical areas in England. 
Surgical resection rates ranged from 9.3% for areas in the lowest 
quintile to 17.2% in the highest, with radical radiotherapy 
varying similarly from 4.0% to 12.9%. These differences are 
associated with outcomes including overall survival at 2 
years. 
The proportion of patients receiving chemotherapy varied 
between 21.6% and 34.5%, and this was associated with survival 
at 6 
months. Chemotherapy treatment rates did not affect 2 
year 
survival, probably reflecting the poor longer-term prognosis 
for advanced lung cancer, irrespective of treatment. The data 
suggest important improvement in lung cancer survival over 
time, but there is potential for further survival gains if the use 
of active treatments in all areas could be increased towards the 
highest current regional rates.
Interpretation and caveats
It is a limitation that 57% of records in the full 2010–2014 dataset 
had a missing value for performance status (PS). The availability 
of PS information in the national cancer register changed in 
2013 due to changes to the national lung cancer audit, which 
previously received this data from hospitals. However, a large 
proportion of the cohort (n=75 
030) had non-missing PS data, 
and statistical adjustment for PS in the 2010–2012 sub-cohort 
did not change the estimated hazard ratios materially.
The incidence of most solid tumours increases with age, 
and lung cancer is, in general, a disease of the elderly. Median 
age at presentation in the UK is in the early 70s17 and is likely 
to increase in the future. This has implications for clinical 
management decisions relating to radical treatment, where

operability and co-morbidity have a significant impact. Impor-
tantly, the heterogeneity of outcomes reported here remain 
significant after standardisation by age and other covariates. 
Although 72% of this national cohort is recorded as having a 
 
Charlson 
co-morbidity 
score 
of 
0, 
this 
is 
based 
on 
in-patient 
activity 
data only, and therefore an under-estimate of the true extent of 
 
co-morbidity in the lung cancer population.
Socio-economic deprivation is associated with low cancer 
survival.23–25 In the case of lung cancer this effect is likely to 
be exaggerated by the very marked inverse association between 
socio-economic status and smoking prevalence.26 This is because 
lung cancer is one of many smoking-related diseases that may 
co-exist in the same patient, and these diseases may not have been 
recognised and recorded. The impact of socio-economic depri-
vation could also support the hypothesis that healthcare-seeking 
behaviours may contribute to the poor outcomes overall in 
England. However, even if systematic behavioural differences do 
exist between the population in England and in other European 
countries, the geographical variation in treatment rates reported 
here highlights an unsatisfactory heterogeneity in delivery of 
active treatment across the country, irrespective of demographics 
and co-morbidities.
The analysis of radiotherapy data was based on the new 
Radiotherapy Data Set (RTDS),27 which is in a relatively early 
stage of development and in need of data harmonisation and 
quality assurance. Although we attempted to identify patients 
receiving stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR)28 by focusing 
on patients with multiple fractions of large doses of radiation, 
we did not succeed in distinguishing these patients from those 
treated with palliative intent. The numbers of patients being 
treated with SABR in England between 2010 and 2013 was rela-
tively small, so this is unlikely to have materially influenced the 
results.
Regarding the associations between therapies, the main 
co-variation in these data was a gradient from little treatment 
towards more treatment (of each kind of treatment and of any 
kind of treatment). Therefore, the general message is about more 
active treatment, using the specific treatment modality that is 
appropriate in relation to the stage of the cancer in each patient. 
A secondary, less strong, gradient was seen between surgery and 
radical radiotherapy. However, as the effects on survival from 
surgery and from radical radiotherapy were manifest in separate 
strata of stage (surgery, stage I and II; radical radiotherapy, stage 
III), we did not pursue the analysis of surgery and radiotherapy 
as alternative strategies, based on these data. The next few years 
of data may perhaps be useful for a comparative study of surgery 
and radical radiotherapy (including SABR).
The present analysis is population-based, and includes all 
lung cancer patients nationally, regardless of hospital attendance 
or specialist oncology care. The survival outcomes we report 
are therefore expected to be inferior to patient groups seen 
in a lung cancer clinic setting29 or analysis restricted to those 
with a confirmed histological diagnosis.30 The advantage of 
the population-based setting is that it includes the entire lung 
cancer population, and avoids the selection bias that would arise 
from selective referral of patients into the lung cancer specialist 
service. As a consequence of the inclusive population-base of the 
study, data including stage and histology were not recorded for 
some patients, and we did not attempt to impute this informa-
tion. The analysis showed that the completeness of recording 
of these variables seemed to be associated with other aspects of 
the local clinical treatment culture. We explored a wide range of 
stratifications and adjustments, and all the important findings 
are reported in the Results section. There was a small degree of 
sensitivity in some of the Cox regressions. Rather than reflecting 
on this as the modification of a causal effect, we think it is more 
likely that the causation is in the opposite direction, and that 
a particular treatment culture (like high use of surgical resec-
tion) is associated with the use of specific evaluation tools (like 
PET scanning and ultrasound guided tissue sampling), and that it 
hereby influences the recording of topography and histology. The 
association in these data was in the direction of more complete 
recording of topography and histology in clinical cultures with 
higher rates of active treatment.
The ‘instrumental variable’ analysis reported here looks 
at survival in combined treated and untreated cancer patients 
for each therapeutic modality. This avoids a direct compar-
ison between treated and untreated patients, which would be 
subject to strong selection bias.31 32 The instrumental variable 
analysis approach can provide measures of effectiveness that are 
not confounded by the characteristics that would otherwise be 
strong confounders at the individual level (age, sex, socio-eco-
nomic status, co-morbidity, performance status). Evidence of 
the validity of the results can be inferred from the absence of 
association between the potential confounder and the treatment 
quintiles, and from the lack of sensitivity of the estimated hazard 
ratios to statistical adjustment for the potential confounder.
The choice of the size of the geographical areas for deriva-
tion of the instrumental variables is somewhat arbitrary. If we 
chose too large an area (like Government Office Region) we 
get a mixture of clinical attitudes within each area, and we lose 
much of the potential variation between areas. If too small areas 
are chosen (like the full postcode) then each patient would likely 
have this area to themselves, and the design collapses to an indi-
vidual-level analysis with its well known biases. The ideal area 
selection is somewhere in-between, but we are not aware of any 
current formal methodology to decide the best area size. Intu-
itively, it would seem preferable if the number of areas corre-
sponds approximately to the number of clinical decision-making 
teams, and the PCT level could then be considered about right.
We used a shared frailty random effects model in order to 
account for the hierarchical nature of the data, with groups of 
patients belonging to the same PCT area. The results were in 
all cases virtually identical to the single-level models and results 
were, therefore, presented from the single-level Cox models.
We attempted to describe, in absolute terms, the number of 
deaths that correspond to the observed differences between the 
Kaplan-Meier survival functions at a selected time-point. The 
assumption is that the observed patients in the low-treatment 
culture could potentially get the same survival as the patients 
observed in the high-treatment culture. The support for this 
conjecture comes from the absence of confounding in the HR 
estimates in the Cox regression analyses.
In the observational setting, an analysis restricted to treated 
patients is likely to show that the survival of treated patients 
is lower when treatment rate is high. This is because a higher 
treatment rate is possible only by giving active treatment to a less 
favourable case-mix. Our analysis has focused on the overall clin-
ical effectiveness of different treatment strategies and patterns.
Changes over time and comparison with another population
It is a limitation of this work that we have studied short-term 
survival, and there is no consideration of patient experience 
or quality of life. This short-term emphasis is appropriate for 
lung cancer patients, who have a poor prognosis compared with 
most other cancers, irrespective of treatment modality. Despite 
this, the increase in 1

calendar year is evidence of remarkable progress (figure 2). It 
has been shown that this improvement in survival is strongest in 
the early stage group.33 The geographical variability in surgical 
resection has increased most where it was higher already.34 It 
would be preferable to see over time a decrease in the geograph-
ical variation, and these trends should continue to be monitored 
for all the treatment modalities. Some initiatives have been taken 
in an effort to address this, with a recent significant increase 
nationally in both the number of surgical resections for lung 
cancer, and in the number of specialist thoracic surgeons.35 36
Results from other national registries show that the highest 
treatment quintiles in England are in line with international stan-
dards. The surgical resection rate in 2014 was 13.1% in England 
and 16.3% in Denmark.37 Overall curative intended treatment 
rates were 19.5% and 30.6%, respectively. The differences in 
treatment intensity are associated with differences in survival 
between the two countries. One-year survival in 2014 was 36% 
in England and 46% in Denmark. Similarly, 2 
year survival was 
20% and 29%, respectively, and 5 
year survival was 9% and 
13%, respectively.
Clinical and policy implications
We have observed superior survival associated with higher use 
of active treatment in lung cancer. Therefore there is certainly 
room for enhanced delivery of care in some geographical areas 
in England. However, there must be a point beyond which 
further increase in treatment rates yields no further survival 
improvement, or may even lead to inferior outcomes. Our 
 
analyses indicate linear relationships between treatment rates 
and survival that extend to the highest range of treatment rates 
for each modality (figure 4). We conclude that even the highest 
treatment rates that we observe are still below the levels required 
for optimal survival outcomes.
Regional variation in lung cancer treatment and outcomes 
in the UK has been examined in several previous studies,17 34 38 
and it has been suggested that major outcome improvements at 
a population level would be achievable if all services were equiv-
alent to the best performing clinical teams in the UK.39 Our data 
validates this suggestion and quantifies the absolute numbers of 
deaths potentially preventable by more uniform care provision. 
The mechanisms required to achieve this range from improving 
access to more specialised lung cancer multi-disciplinary teams,4 
to increasing the numbers of specialist thoracic surgeons.38
The National Health Service in England has developed guid-
ance for regional commissioning bodies based on the best lung 
cancer services provided at major centres. This guidance suggests 
local provision where possible, with support from larger centres 
if necessary. Implementation of these recommendations remains 
a demanding challenge because multiple institutions and clinical 
services must be coordinated in each geographical region, but 
our data demonstrates that the potential benefits are significant 
and achievable. We have established that a clinical culture that is 
active in its use of available therapies improves outcomes for the 
lung cancer patients in its community.
