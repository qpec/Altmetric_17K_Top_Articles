A Systematic Review

Background: The relationship between sugar and health is af-
fected by energy balance, macronutrient substitutions, and diet
and lifestyle patterns. Several authoritative organizations have is-
sued public health guidelines addressing dietary sugars.
Purpose: To systematically review guidelines on sugar intake
and assess consistency of recommendations, methodological
quality of guidelines, and the quality of evidence supporting
each recommendation.
Data Sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science (1995
to September 2016); guideline registries; and gray literature
(bibliographies, Google, and experts).
Study Selection: Guidelines addressing sugar intake that re-
ported their methods of development and were published in
English between 1995 and 2016.
Data Extraction: Three reviewers independently assessed
guideline quality using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research
and Evaluation, 2nd edition (AGREE II), instrument. To assess ev-
idence quality, articles supporting recommendations were inde-
pendently reviewed and their quality was determined by using
GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Develop-
ment and Evaluation) methods.
Data Synthesis: The search identified 9 guidelines that offered
12 recommendations. Each of the reviewed guidelines indicated
a suggested decrease in the consumption of foods containing
nonintrinsic sugars. The guidelines scored poorly on AGREE II
criteria, specifically in rigor of development, applicability, and
editorial independence. Seven recommendations provided non-
quantitative guidance; 5 recommended less than 25% to less
than 5% of total calories from nonintrinsic sugars. The recom-
mendations were based on various health concerns, including
nutrient displacement, dental caries, and weight gain. Quality of
evidence supporting recommendations was low to very low.
Limitation: The authors conducted the study independent of
the funding source, which is primarily supported by the food and
agriculture industry.
Conclusion: Guidelines on dietary sugar do not meet criteria for
trustworthy recommendations and are based on low-quality ev-
idence. Public health officials (when promulgating these recom-
mendations) and their public audience (when considering di-
etary behavior) should be aware of these limitations.

T
he relationship between sugar and health is com-
plex due to multiple interrelated variables, includ-
ing state of energy balance, macronutrient substitu-
tions, and underlying diet and lifestyle patterns (1).
Existing evidence of a link between sugar intake and
adverse health outcomes has been translated into di-
etary guidance and recommendations for the general
public by authoritative health organizations (2). Dietary
guidance addresses the types of sugars, especially
sources of nonintrinsic sugars, such as added sugars
and free sugars (2). Added sugars consist of monosac-
charides and disaccharides added during the produc-
tion and preparation of foods and beverages and do
not include sugars naturally found in milk, fruit, and fruit
juice. Free sugars comprise sugars added to products
as well as sugars naturally found in fruit, honey, and
syrup (3).
As research continues to add knowledge, authori-
tative organizations have issued public health guidance
based on the available evidence (2). Recent guidelines
have included both qualitative and quantitative recom-
mendations that consistently focus on limiting and re-
ducing sugar consumption, especially sources of non-
intrinsic sugars (2). For example, in 2015, the World
Health Organization (WHO), the Scientific Advisory
Committee on Nutrition (SACN), and the U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services issued public health guidelines (PHGs)
with specific recommendations for dietary sugar intake
(4–6). Each organization conducted its own review of
the available evidence and published its recommenda-
tions, including the scientific basis for its conclusions.
These organizations have crafted different recommen-
dations with regard to sugar consumption, with various
rationales for limiting intake.
When respected organizations issue conflicting
recommendations, it can result in confusion and raises
concern about the quality of the guidelines and the un-
derlying evidence. We conducted a systematic survey
and critical appraisal of authoritative PHGs, including
an assessment of the quality of evidence supporting
recommendations for dietary sugar intake.

 METHODS
We registered the protocol for this systematic re-
view in the PROSPERO database in November 2015
(registration number CRD42015029182) (7).
Data Sources and Searches
Using a search strategy developed with the help
of an experienced librarian, we searched MEDLINE,
EMBASE, and Web of Science (1995 to September
2016) using subject terms and keywords. We searched
5 gray literature sources, including Google (Appendix
Table 1, available at Annals.org), as well as bibliogra-
phies of included studies. We consulted with 3 experts
in the field of carbohydrates (Appendix Table 1) to
identify additional guidelines we may have missed. Our
search was restricted to English-language guidelines.
Study Selection
Our criteria for inclusion were 1) PHGs, defined as
documents developed by a nationally recognized com-
mittee, a publicly funded institution, or a medical soci-
ety that provided recommendations for sugar intake in
the general population; 2) inclusion of an explicit meth-
odology section, either within the guideline or in
supporting documents (for example, definition of the
search strategy, evidence quality assessment, and
methods used to create recommendations); 3) the
most recent version of publications from an organiza-
tion; and 4) publication between 1995 and 2016.
Our target outcomes of interest were the overall
quality of development of the PHGs; the consistency of
sugar recommendations, both quantitative and qualita-
tive; the strength of the recommendations; an assess-
ment of the supporting evidence for each recommen-
dation; the use of systematic review methods; explicit
links between recommendations and supporting evi-
dence; and the strengths and limitations of the body of
evidence.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
Two
reviewers
(B.S.
and
J.E.)
independently
screened titles and abstracts, full-text articles, and data
extracted from included PHGs by using standardized,
pilot-tested forms. We abstracted the following guide-
line characteristics: title, year, authors, language, orga-
nization, whether it was a novel publication or an up-
date, location of development, the recommendations
for sugar intake along with the strength of each recom-
mendation, and the authors'assessment of the quality
of the supporting evidence. Pairs of reviewers (B.S.,
J.E., L.L., and B.C.J.) independently identified, ex-
tracted, and appraised references to the evidence used
to justify each recommendation, including the types of
sugars (for example, added, free, or total) referenced in
the supporting body of literature. Reviewers resolved
disagreements by consensus and, if consensus could
not be reached, consulted with senior scientists (B.C.J.
and J.S.).
Three reviewers (B.S., J.E., and L.L.) independently
appraised guidelines by using the Appraisal of Guide-
lines for Research and Evaluation, 2nd edition (AGREE
II), instrument, comprising 23 items within 6 domains:
scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of
development, clarity of presentation, applicability, and
editorial independence (Appendix Table 2, available at
Annals.org) (8). In addition, 2 overall assessments were
completed for each PHG: a score of 1 to 7, and whether
the reviewer would recommend using the guideline
(recommended, recommended with modifications, or
not recommended). We conducted a calibration exer-
cise using 2 guidelines to ensure consistency and valid-
ity and resolved disagreements by consensus. Item rat-
ing differences of 3 points or fewer between reviewers
were permitted. Senior scientists (B.C.J. and J.S.) were
available for discrepancies but were not needed.
Quality Appraisal of Evidence Used in Guidelines
We used the GRADE (Grading of Recommenda-
tions Assessment, Development and Evaluation) ap-
proach (9) to independently assess the quality of the
evidence underlying each recommendation. For each
target outcome linked to a recommendation, GRADE
assigns the quality of evidence as high, moderate, low,
or very low. Systematic reviews of randomized, con-
trolled trials (RCTs) started with high quality of evi-
dence, whereas systematic reviews of observational
studies started with low quality. In instances where only
single studies for recommendations were cited, RCTs
started with moderate-quality evidence and observa-
tional studies started with very-low-quality evidence.
For each body of evidence (systematic reviews) and for
each citation (single studies), where possible, we con-
sidered downgrading the quality of evidence on the
basis of 5 domains: risk of bias, indirectness, impreci-
sion, inconsistency, and publication bias. Subsequently,
we considered rating up on the basis of 3 domains:
large effect size, dose–response, and an absence of re-
sidual or unmeasured confounding.
Data Synthesis and Analysis
Agreement for the full-text screening was calcu-
lated using the � statistic and its 95% CI (10). For each
guideline, we calculated the AGREE II score for each
domain as a percentage of the maximum possible
score and standardized range. We considered 60% as a
threshold of acceptable quality. Interrater agreement
was calculated using the intraclass correlation coeffi-
cient with corresponding 95% CIs (11). Agreement of
0.01 to 0.20 was considered poor, 0.21 to 0.40 was
considered fair, 0.41 to 0.60 was considered moderate,
0.61 to 0.80 was considered substantial, and 0.81 to
1.00 was considered very good (12). For all AGREE II
domains across all PHGs, we calculated the median do-
main score and the interquartile range (IQR). All analy-
ses were conducted using Excel 2013 (Microsoft).
Role of the Funding Source
This study was supported by the Technical Com-
mittee on Dietary Carbohydrates of the North American
branch of the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI
North America). ILSI North America is a public, non-
profit foundation that provides a forum to advance un-
derstanding of scientific issues related to the nutritional
quality and safety of the food supply by sponsoring re-

60% of its financial support from its more than 400 in-
dustry members. The authors wrote the protocol, which
was reviewed for scope clarifications and approved by
ILSI. The funding source had no role in the conduct of

RESULTS
A total of 5315 records were screened, 26 records
were considered potentially eligible for full-text screen-
ing, and 9 PHGs proved eligible (Figure). Eligible
guidelines included 1 global guideline (4), 2 interna-
tional guidelines (13, 14), and 6 national guidelines (5,
6, 15–18). Guidelines were published from 2002 to
2015 by the following agencies: the U.S. Department of
Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Health and Hu-
man Services (6), WHO (4), SACN and Public Health
England (5), the Ministry of Health of Brazil (15), the
Australian National Health and Medical Research Coun-
cil (18), the Nordic Council of Ministers (14), the Ger-
man Nutrition Society (16), the Food Safety Authority of
Ireland (17), and the Institute of Medicine (13) (Table 1).
Recommendation Characteristics
The 9 PHGs provided a total of 12 recommenda-
tions on dietary sugar intake. All recommendations ad-
vocated for reduced intake of nonintrinsic free or
added sugars and/or decreased consumption of foods
and beverages high in refined sugars, and 5 recom-
mendations provided specific sugar intake limits (Table
1). Guidelines used variable terminology in sugar rec-
ommendations. For example, 2 guidelines used the
term “free sugars” (4, 5), 3 used the term “added sug-
ars” (6, 13, 14), 2 made recommendations on sugar-
sweetened beverages (SSBs) (5, 16), and 3 referred to
food and beverage sources of refined sugars (15, 17,
18). Quantitative recommendations ranged from less
than 5% of total energy from free sugars (4, 5) to less
than 25% of total energy from added sugars (13). The
rationale for decreased sugar intake included nutrient
displacement, excess energy intake, dental caries,
bone health, weight gain, and obesity. Four guidelines
assessed the quality of the evidence and used the as-
sessment to develop their recommendations (4, 5, 16,
18), and 5 did not (6, 13, 15, 17, 19).
Quality Assessment of Guidelines:
AGREE II Results
Scope and Purpose
Items in this domain evaluate the overall objectives,
related health questions, and the target population of
the guideline (20). Across guidelines, the median score
for this domain was 81.5% (IQR, 72.2% to 88.0%), indi-
cating that most items were highly rated (Table 2).
Eight of the 9 guidelines reached the 60% threshold for
reporting. The main limitation across all guidelines was
the description of expected benefit, or outcomes, of
the guidelines.
Stakeholder Involvement
Stakeholder involvement criteria focus on the ex-
tent of involvement of appropriate participants in the
guideline development process and whether it reflects
the views of its intended users (20). The median score
for this domain was 63.0% (IQR, 38.9% to 77.8%) (Table
2). Four guidelines scored below 60% in this domain (5,
13, 16, 17). Many guidelines did not describe how they
sought the views and preferences of their target popu-
lation (patients or the public), and those that did were
vague about the process.
Rigor of Development
Rigor of development relates to the methods used
for gathering and synthesizing the evidence for guide-
line development, formulation of the recommenda-
tions, and the process for updating the guideline (20).
The median score for this domain was low, at 47.2%
(IQR, 24.0% to 69.4%) (Table 2). Three of the guidelines
met the 60% threshold (4, 6, 18). Four guidelines did
not use systematic methods to search for evidence (6,
13, 15, 17). Four guidelines assigned strength to their
recommendations (4, 6, 16, 18), but only the WHO
guideline used the GRADE approach (4). Three of the

 guidelines discussed external review by experts before
publication (4, 6, 18). Two guidelines appropriately de-
scribed the process for updating recommendations
(4, 6).
Clarity of Presentation
Clarity of presentation relates to whether key rec-
ommendations are unambiguous and easily identifi-
able in the guideline (20). The median score for this
domain was 59.3% (IQR, 49.1% to 71.3%), with 4 guide-
lines meeting the 60% threshold (6, 13, 17, 18) (Table
2). The main limitation in this domain was that the dif-
ferent options for management of the health issue (for
example, ways to limit sugar intake) were not clearly
presented.
Applicability
Items in the applicability domain focus on the likely
barriers to and facilitators of implementation, strategies
to improve uptake, and resource implications of apply-
ing the guideline (20). The median score for this do-
main was low, at 34.7% (IQR, 11.1% to 50.0%) (Table 2).
Only 1 guideline met the 60% threshold (18). The most
common issue was failing to discuss the facilitators and
barriers to the guideline'
s application and failing to ad-
dress the resource implications of applying the recom-
mendations. Only 1 guideline (4) presented monitoring
and auditing criteria.
Editorial Independence
Editorial independence relates to unbiased formu-
lation of recommendations and competing interests
(20). This domain had the lowest median score (33.3%
[IQR, 6.9% to 65.3%]), with only 2 guidelines meeting
the 60% threshold (Table 2). Most of the guidelines ei-
ther did not provide a statement about funding and its
influence in the process of guideline development or
failed to state conflicts of interest of authors or the
guideline panel (Appendix Table 3, available at Annals
.org).
Overall Assessment
Overall guideline quality was moderate (median
score, 4.0 [IQR, 3.7 to 4.8]), with only the Australian
guideline meeting the 60% threshold for all 6 domains.
Scores ranged from 3.3 (German guideline [16]) to
5.3 (Australian guideline [18]) (Table 2). All of the
guidelines were categorized as “recommended with
modifications.”

 Quality Assessment of Supporting Evidence for
Recommendations: GRADE Results
There were a total of 66 unique publications across
9 eligible guidelines supporting the 12 dietary sugar
recommendations. Evidence included systematic re-
views; RCTs; nonrandomized, controlled trials; pro-
spective cohort studies; case–control studies; national
surveys; and cross-sectional studies (Appendix Table 4,
available at Annals.org). The Dietary Guidelines for the
Brazilian Population and the 2015–2020 Dietary Guide-
lines for Americans did not cite any previously pub-
lished studies as evidence for their recommendations
(6, 15), and Public Health England conducted its own
systematic reviews for its Carbohydrates and Health re-
port that have not been published in a peer-reviewed
journal but were publicly available (5).
Sixteen systematic reviews were used to inform 7
recommendations across 5 guidelines (4, 5, 14, 16, 18)
(Appendix Table 5, available at Annals.org). Evidence
was low to very low for each systematic review. Four-
teen reviews (87.5%) were downgraded for inconsis-
tency, 11 (68.8%) were downgraded for imprecision, 2
(14%) were downgraded for publication bias, and 2
(12.5%) were downgraded for indirectness.
Two large RCTs (21, 22), both on SSBs and body
weight, informed 2 recommendations from the German
and Australian guidelines (16, 18) (Appendix Table 5).
Our independent review indicated that the evidence
was of very low quality for both and was downgraded
for imprecision (wide CIs and trivial treatment effects
based on the lower bound of the 95% CI) and indirect-
ness. Eight small RCTs (<300 events for dichotomous
outcomes or <400 participants for continuous out-
comes) started at moderate quality and were all down-
graded to very low quality due to imprecision and
indirectness.
Eight large cohort studies (Appendix Table 5), all
on SSBs and health outcomes (such as type 2 diabetes
and body weight), informed 3 recommendations across
the Nordic, German, and Australian guidelines (14, 16,
18). Evidence was considered very low quality for 6
studies (75%) (23–28) and low quality for 2 studies
(25%) (29, 30). Three studies were downgraded for in-
directness (37.5%), and 2 were downgraded for impre-
cision (25%). Two studies were rated up for a dose–
response (25%) (29, 30). Twenty-eight small cohort
studies started at very low quality, and we did not rate
up given their imprecision and indirectness.
Although a Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee
drafted an extensive scientific report (31) to inform the
2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (6), the
guidelines cited food pattern modeling and U.S. na-
tional caloric intake data from added sugars to inform
recommendations. We planned to use GRADE to eval-
uate the quality of the evidence used in the model
components as well as the accuracy of the modeling
procedure; however, these details were not publicly
available, and we were unable to assess the quality of
the evidence for the recommendations.
The WHO guideline was the only one to use the
GRADE approach (9). The WHO conducted 2 system-
atic reviews, one of which included observational stud-
ies evaluating effects of free sugars on dental caries
(assessed as moderate-quality by the WHO and graded
up for large effect size) and the other including RCTs
and observational studies evaluating effects of free
sugars on body weight (assessed as moderate-quality
by the WHO and downgraded for publication bias). Al-
though the WHO guideline recommendations are for
free sugars, included studies among both systematic
reviews used various forms of sugar, including sucrose,
added sugars, and total sugars for the dental caries
review (32) and free sugars, SSBs, fructose, sucrose,
sweet foods, and added sugars for the body weight
review (33). Similar discrepancies were found in 5 ad-
ditional guidelines (Table 1).
We independently reviewed the WHO evidence
profiles and deemed the quality of evidence on sugars
and body weight to be low (with additional downgrad-
ing for inconsistency). We also reasoned that the evi-
dence on sugar and dental caries was low (unlike
WHO'
s rationale, we did not rate up for a large effect
size). The WHO issued a strong recommendation to re-
duce free sugars to less than 10% of daily caloric intake
based on 5 cohort studies (1200 children) assessing the
risk for dental caries and a weak recommendation to
reduce free sugars to less than 5% of daily caloric in-
take based on 3 ecological studies on the risk for den-
tal caries.
DISCUSSION
We identified 9 PHGs containing 12 dietary sugar
recommendations. The quality of development of the
guidelines (assessed using the AGREE II instrument)
was moderate, with 3 of 6 AGREE II domains (rigor of
development,
applicability,
and
editorial
indepen-
dence) having major limitations. Seven recommenda-
tions were qualitative, whereas 5 were quantitative,
ranging from less than 5% to less than 25% of total
calories from nonintrinsic sugars per day. The rationale
for the varied sugar intake recommendations was
based primarily on nutrient displacement, dental car-
ies, and weight gain.
Using the GRADE approach, we found that the
overall quality of evidence to support recommenda-
tions was low to very low. Optimal guidelines should be
developed with increased rigor, and recommendations
should be specific (population, exposure, comparator
group, and outcomes critically important to the general
public) and transparent (including explicit conflicts of
interest and how the body of evidence was considered
for developing each recommendation) and should fol-
low GRADE guidance as intended (weak recommenda-
tions if the quality of evidence is low, with few excep-
tions [34]).
A PubMed search for reviews of dietary sugar
guidelines done within the past 5 years identified only
1 other review. Although Hess and colleagues (2) re-
viewed dietary sugar recommendations around the
world, the search was not systematic and the review did
not assess the quality of the guidelines or the support-

 ing evidence. The authors concluded that no clear
link exists between added sugar intake and health
outcomes.
The included guidelines examined the potential
health effects of sugars and risk for dental caries, obe-
sity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The
WHO and SACN suggested that a strong correlation
exists between overall free sugars and health outcomes
(4, 5). In both guidelines, most of the cited evidence
examined SSB consumption and health outcomes
rather than the consumption of free sugars from various
foods.
Our review had limitations. This project was funded
by ILSI, an organization that is funded primarily by the
food and agriculture industry. The authors, having ex-
pertise in study methodology (particularly in the devel-
opment of practice guidelines), wrote the protocol and
conducted the study independent of the funding body.
However, given our funding source, our study team has
a financial conflict of interest and readers should con-
sider our results carefully.
We initially sought to assess the quality of the evi-
dence underlying the recommendations by using the
Oxford Levels of Evidence, as indicated in our publicly
available protocol. Post hoc, we chose to use the
GRADE approach, wherein a body of evidence is cate-
gorized using intuitive language (high, moderate, low,
or very low quality) and each category is accompanied
by an explicit definition. In contrast, the Oxford Levels
of Evidence uses numbers associated with specific
study designs based on the traditional hierarchy of ev-
idence. We believe that the Oxford Levels of Evidence
gives a false impression of the evidence (for example, a
systematic review of RCTs rated as level 1 evidence de-
spite potentially serious limitations when comprehen-
sively assessed using the GRADE approach). With
GRADE methods, the evidence can be rated up or
down on the basis of a set of criteria (such as precision,
risk of bias, and publication bias). The criteria are ap-
plied using a systematic and explicit approach that in-
cludes extensive instructions and transparency with re-
spect to the quality assessment. We believe that the
use of GRADE reduces the likelihood of mislabeling the
overall certainty of evidence.
Only 9 guidelines that explicitly reported their
methods were included in this review. Given our fo-
cused eligibility criteria, this was not a review of all
available dietary sugar recommendations that may in-
fluence the beliefs and actions of the public, regulators,
and health care practitioners. For example, we identi-
fied 4 publications (35–38) containing dietary sugar rec-
ommendations
written
by
influential
organizations
(American Academy of Pediatrics, European Food
Safety Authority, American Heart Association, and India
National Institute of Nutrition) that were excluded be-
cause they lacked a written methodology section. We
did not include these reports because a comprehen-
sive understanding of the methods used to develop a
PHG is essential to assessing the quality of the devel-
opment of a guideline and the quality of evidence for
recommendations. We also excluded PHGs that were
not published in English. Although our review included
guidelines from around the world, it was not a compre-
hensive review of all potentially available guidelines.
Our review also had several strengths. A priori, we
documented our eligibility criteria, objectives, and
planned methods of analysis as publicly registered on
PROSPERO (7). We independently assessed the quality
of development of dietary guidelines by using AGREE II
and the certainty of evidence for sugar recommenda-
tions by using the GRADE framework, which has been
endorsed by more than 90 health organizations world-
wide (39). On the basis of our methodological analysis
of PHGs, we believe the range of various recommenda-
tions and the evidence that supports these recommen-
dations can be better interpreted by health care profes-
sionals
and
consumers
trying
to
design
effective
programs and provide guidance to the public about
sugar intake.
All of the reviewed guidelines suggested a de-
crease in consumption of nonintrinsic sugars. Although
the overall direction was consistent, the rationale and
evidence used to make each recommendation were in-
consistent. This lack of evidentiary consistency, with
various health concerns cited, creates confusion for
practitioners and the public about the role that sugar
plays in health.
Quantitative limits on sugar intake were recom-
mended in 5 of the 9 PHGs (4–6, 13, 14). Each of the
quantitative sugar recommendations (except the WHO
recommendation) was based on an estimate of how
much sugar could be consumed while maintaining a
“healthy diet.” For example, the Dietary Reference In-
takes and the 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Amer-
icans set limits of less than 25% and less than 10% of
energy from added sugars, respectively (6, 13), based
on diet modeling and intake data. Similarly, the SACN
recommendation was based on the desired energy re-
duction of 100 calories per day for effective population-
wide weight loss. An approximated 100 calories of free
sugars was subtracted from the previous sugar recom-
mendation to obtain this 100-calorie deficit, resulting in
the specified maximal intake of 5% of total energy from
free sugars (5). The method by which the Nordic Coun-
cil of Ministers determined a limit of 10% of energy
from added sugars was not explained in its PHG (14). In
contrast, the WHO used 5 cohort studies (moderate
quality) and 3 ecological studies (very low quality) on
the risk for dental caries to set the limit of intake of free
sugars to below 10% and 5% of total energy intake (4).
The quality of available evidence to link sugar with
health outcomes was generally rated as low to very low.
The prevailing concerns with high sugar intake are di-
rected toward excessive calorie consumption and nutri-
ent displacement. Sugar added to products adds con-
siderable calories without any nutritional benefits and
may take the place of other nutrient-dense foods in the
diet. From a practical standpoint, added sugars are a
source of calories that many public health authorities
believe can be easily reduced. Doing so at a population
level may result in a reduction in caloric intake and a
subsequent decrease in the rate of overweight and

Financial Support: This project was funded by the Technical
Committee on Dietary Carbohydrates of ILSI North America.
The authors wrote the protocol, the scope of which was re-
viewed and approved by ILSI; and conducted the study inde-

Disclosures: Dr. Slavin served on the 2010 Dietary Guidelines
for
Americans
Advisory
Committee
(DGAC)
where
she
chaired the carbohydrate committee that reviewed the rela-
tionships between added sugar intake and health outcomes.
The results of that review were published in the 2010 DGACs,
in Nutrition Reviews (Slavin J. Beverages and body weight:
challenges in the evidence-based review process of the Car-
bohydrate Subcommittee from the 2010 Dietary Guidelines
Advisory Committee. Nutr Rev. 2012;70 Suppl 2:S111-20.).
She has presented widely on her work as chair of the carbo-
hydrate and protein committees for the 2010 DGAC. Most of
her research is in the areas of dietary fiber and gut health. As
a dietitian, she is interested in dietary patterns and whole
foods. Her research funding in the area of dietary sugars is
summarized below. She received a grant from ILSI-NA Carbo-
hydrate Committee in 2010 to examine sugar recommenda-
tions. That work was published in 2012 (Hess J, Latulippe ME,
Ayoob K, Slavin J. The confusing world of dietary sugars: def-
initions, intakes, food sources and international dietary rec-
ommendations. Food Funct. 2012;3:477-86.). One of the co-
authors of that paper was an employee of ILSI-NA at the time.
That information is disclosed in the paper. Dr. Slavin and the
University of Minnesota received the grant from ILSI-NA to
support the current project. Besides ILSI-NA, Dr. Slavin thanks
the following organizations for providing research funds for
her laboratory the past 3 years: Minnesota Beef Council (sati-
ety), Minnesota Cultivated Wild Rice Council (literature re-
view), Barilla (snacking), Novartis Consumer Health (GSK) (fi-
ber), American Pulse Association (satiety), MNDrive Global
Food Ventures (nutrients in spinach), United States Depart-
ment of Agriculture (fiber), The Mushroom Council (gut
health), Pepsico (oatmeal), Welch’s (FODMAPs), Nestle Health
Sciences (FODMAPs), and DSM (fiber). Her laboratory also has
received contracts for services for analytical services in the
areas of dietary fiber, whole grains, legumes, FODMAPS, di-
gestive health, protein needs, carbohydrate needs, and
snacking: Besides the companies listed, the laboratory has
received funds in the past 3 years from Danone (snacking)
and Coca-Cola (fiber). When the work is published, the fund-
ing source for all work in the laboratory will be disclosed as
outlined by the journal. Dr. Slavin speaks widely on a range of
human nutrition topics. Some talks on the topic of interest in
this paper: "Fluid Consumption: Caloric Contribution to
Weight Gain/Loss and Health: Factors That Influence Satiety"
(Second International Conference on hydration and Health,
sponsored by the ILSI North America Committee on Hydra-
tion, November 2011); "The Confusing World of Dietary Sug-
ars: Views From the 2010 Dietary Guidelines Scientific Advi-
sory Committee" (2012 Nutrition News Forecast, Academy of
Nutrition and Dietetics, April 2012); "Food Is Not a Talisman:
Reflections on the Science and Practice of Nutrition" (WO At-
water Lecture at Experimental Biology, April 2015). For full
financial disclosure: ILSI meetings do not pay speakers; other
scientific meetings also typically do not pay speakers if you
are a member of that society. Dr. Slavin serves on the scientific
advisory board for Tate and Lyle, Kerry Ingredients, Atkins
Nutritionals, and Midwest Dairy Association. She also owns
one-third share of the Slavin Sisters Farm LLC, a 119-acre farm
in Walworth, Wisconsin, that is currently rented. Crops in 2016
included corn, soybeans, and pumpkins. Dr. Johnston is a
member of GRADE, a working group that has developed a
common, sensible, and transparent approach to grading
quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. In ad-
dition to being a methods consultant to ILSI for this project,
over the last 5 years, he has held investigator-initiated grants
unrelated to the topic of sugar from BioK+ (a probiotic man-
ufacturer), Genzyme (a manufacturer of enzyme replacement
therapy for patients with rare lysosomal storage diseases), and
a joint grant funded by Nestle and MITACS Accelerate (a pro-
vincially and federally supported not-for-profit organization
that works with Canadian universities and companies to build
partnerships that support industrial and social innovation in
Canada) to assess probiotics for preventing necrotizing en-
terocolitis. Authors not named here have disclosed no con-

final 2 of 3 recommendations.
† The WHO rated the quality of evidence as “moderate”; however, in our independent assessment, we considered WHO'
s reasoning for rating up from low to be inappropriate.
‡ Public Health England conducted its own systematic reviews that were unpublished.
