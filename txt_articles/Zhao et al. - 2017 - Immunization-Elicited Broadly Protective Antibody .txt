SUMMARY
While neutralizing antibodies are highly effective
against ebolavirus infections, current experimental
ebolavirus vaccines primarily elicit species-specific
antibody responses. Here, we describe an immu-
nization-elicited
macaque
antibody
(CA45)
that
clamps the internal fusion loop with the N terminus
of the ebolavirus glycoproteins (GPs) and potently
neutralizes Ebola, Sudan, Bundibugyo, and Reston
viruses. CA45, alone or in combination with an
antibody that blocks receptor binding, provided
full
protection
against
all
pathogenic
ebolavi-
ruses in mice, guinea pigs, and ferrets. Analysis
of memory B cells from the immunized macaque
suggests that elicitation of broadly neutralizing
antibodies (bNAbs) for ebolaviruses is possible
but difficult, potentially due to the rarity of bNAb
clones and their precursors. Unexpectedly, germ-
line-reverted
CA45,
while
exhibiting
negligible
binding to full-length GP, bound a proteolytically
remodeled GP with picomolar affinity, suggest-
ing that engineered ebolavirus
vaccines could
trigger rare bNAb precursors more robustly. These
findings have important implications for developing
pan-ebolavirus
vaccine
and
immunotherapeutic
cocktails.
INTRODUCTION
Members of Filoviridae family (filoviruses) are among the dead-
liest viruses with no approved treatments or vaccines available
for human use. There are five known ebolavirus species: Ebola
(EBOV), Sudan (SUDV), Bundibugyo (BDBV), Reston (RESTV),
and Taı
¨ Forest (TAFV) viruses, a cuevavirus, and two marburgvi-
ruses: Marburg virus (MARV) and Ravn virus (RAVV) (Kuhn et al.,
2014). Since 1967 multiple outbreaks of MARV, SUDV, and
BDBV have been recorded and in the recent Ebola virus disease
epidemic in 2014, caused by the Zaire EBOV, the virus seems to
have mutated to infect humans more efficiently (Diehl et al.,
2016). Current vaccines and immunotherapeutics advancing
through late stage development are specific for EBOV (Zaire).
Thus, broadly protective vaccines and antibody therapeutics
for filoviruses are critically needed.
Filovirus entry is mediated by the trimeric filovirus glycopro-
teins (GPs), which consist of disulfide-linked GP1 and GP2 sub-
units, with GP1 forming a chalice-like structure wrapped around
by GP2 (Lee et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2016). GP2 and the N termi-
nus of GP1 form the chalice base. The receptor binding site
(RBS) is positioned on the GP1 apex and largely concealed by
a glycan cap and a highly glycosylated and disordered mucin-
like domain (MLD). Filoviruses enter the endosomes via micropi-
nocytosis, during which the cysteine proteases cathepsin B and
L cleave off the MLD and the glycan cap, exposing the RBS and
allowing GP1 to interact with its endosomal receptor, Niemann
Pick C1 (NPC1) (Bornholdt et al., 2016a; Miller et al., 2012;
Wang et al., 2016a). Upon binding to NPC1, and in response to

891
 an undefined trigger, GP2 is proposed to undergo major rear-
rangements to insert its internal fusion loop (IFL) into the endoso-
mal membrane and initiate viral fusion (Lee and Saphire, 2009).
Three mechanisms of neutralization have been postulated
for ebolaviruses: inhibition of cathepsin-mediated cleavage,
blockade of NPC1 binding, and mechanical interference with
the structural rearrangements of GP2 required for fusion (Saphire
and Aman, 2016). The best characterized neutralizing epitope
within EBOV GP is the base epitope, consisting of residues
at the GP1-GP2 interface, which is recognized by the mono-
clonal antibody (mAb) KZ52 (Lee et al., 2008) and with a slightly
different angle by two ZMapp components, c2G4 and c4G7
(Murin et al., 2014). However, these base binders only neutralize
EBOV. A similar base binder, 16F6, was also reported to
neutralize SUDV only (Dias et al., 2011). Recently, we and others
have identified several cross-neutralizing epitopes within the
RBS (Howell et al., 2016; Keck et al., 2015) and the glycan cap
(Bornholdt et al., 2016b; Flyak et al., 2016; Holtsberg et al.,
2015), suggesting that development of broadly neutralizing anti-
bodies (bNAbs) and cross-protective vaccines might be feasible.
Here, we report an ebolavirus bNAb, called CA45, elicited by
immunization of nonhuman primates (NHPs), that binds to a
conserved epitope positioned within the IFL. CA45 potently
neutralizes EBOV, SUDV, and BDBV, the only ebolaviruses
known to cause lethal disease in humans, and protects rodents
from EBOV and SUDV infection. Furthermore, a cocktail of CA45
with the RBS-binding mAb FVM04 fully protects guinea pigs
from lethal EBOV and ferrets from BDBV infection. This study
has further important implications for vaccine development.
Unexpectedly, we found that a proteolytically remodeled GP
resembling the endosomal form of GP generated by host ca-
thepsins (cleaved GP, GPCL) binds with >106-fold higher affinity
to the CA45 germline precursor compared to full-length GP, indi-
cating that similar modification of vaccine immunogens could
potentially enhance the elicitation of CA45-like bNAbs.
The isolation of bNAbs against ebolavirus from vaccinated
NHPs, their superior protective efficacy, and the prospect of
germline targeting by vaccine re-design strongly support the
premise of pan-ebolavirus antibody cocktails for therapy and a
pan-ebolavirus vaccine for prevention.
RESULTS
Isolation of Ebolavirus Cross-reactive mAbs
A cynomolgus macaque (NHP #20667) was immunized three
times with a trivalent GP cocktail consisting of EBOV, SUDV,
and MARV GPDmuc (ectodomain lacking MLD) in a previous
study (Keck et al., 2015). Serum from this macaque (4 weeks
after the third immunization) neutralized EBOV, SUDV, and
BDBV (Figure 1A), suggesting that ebolavirus cross-reactive B
cells may exist in this animal. Using an optimized fluorescently
labeled memory B cell surface marker cocktail (Sundling et al.,
2012; Wang et al., 2016b) along with GPDmuc of EBOV and
SUDV, we stained the peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) obtained at this time point of this animal. GP cross-reac-
tive memory B cells (CD20+IgG+Aqua blue�CD14�CD3�CD8�
CD27+IgM�, EBOV GPDmuchi SUDV GPDmuchi) (Figure 1B)
were sorted, followed by single-cell RT-PCR conversion/amplifi-
cation to recover the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy-chain (HC) and
light-chain (LC) genes.

 About 0.5% of the memory B cell of this macaque was GP
specific, with �0.06% being EBOV/SUDV cross-reactive, ac-
counting for �10% of GP-specific memory B cells (Table S1).
We sorted out 29 ebolavirus family GP cross-reactive memory
B cells, of which 17 had paired HCs and LCs. Of these, 12 clones
were expressed as full-length IgG1 for ELISA assay (Table S1).
More than 90% of the clones (11/12) bound both EBOV and
SUDV GPDmuc (Figure 1C), validating the sorting precision.
Analysis of the HC and LC variable regions (VH and VL) along
with the HC and LC complementarity determining region 3
(CDRH3 and CDRL3) revealed that 4 of 11 clones were related
to each other and/or to clones identified by yeast display method
in our previous study (Keck et al., 2015), while the remaining
7 were unique clones (Table S2). In a neutralization assay with
recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) pseudotyped with
either EBOV or SUDV GP, we found that �30% (4/11) of the
GP cross-reactive clones neutralized rVSV with either GP.
Only one clone, CA45, neutralizing both EBOV and SUDV, was
identified as a bNAb (Table S2).
Binding and Functional Characterization of CA45
Given that filovirus receptor interaction and membrane fusion
occurs in the acidified endosomes, we examined CA45 binding
to GP ectodomains (GPDTM) at both acidic and neutral pH by
ELISA. CA45 strongly bound to GPDTM of EBOV, SUDV,
BDBV, and moderately to RESTV at both pH (Figure 2A). The
reactivity of CA45 was moderately enhanced under acidic pH
condition for all GPDTM. We also tested the binding of CA45
to cathepsin-cleaved GP (GPCL), the form that interacts with
NPC1 in the endosomes and mediates the membrane fusion.
CA45 bound to EBOV GPCL about 23-, 14-, and 7-fold better
than to GPDTM at pHs 7.5, 5.5, and 4.5, respectively (Figure 2A).
In contrast, CA45 did not bind soluble GP (sGP), the product
of the unedited EBOV GP gene (residues 1–295 followed by a
unique C-terminal tail) (Figure 2A). These data indicate that
CA45 binding does not require the MLD or the glycan cap and
that removal of these domains reduces the steric constraints
on CA45 binding.
BioLayer interferometry (BLI) was used to evaluate the kinetics
of CA45 binding to GPDTM and EBOV GPCL (Figure 2B). The
apparent KD values for GPDTM were determined to be approxi-
mately 10.6 nM for EBOV, 3.3 nM for SUDV, 1.2 nM for BDBV,
and 161 nM for RESTV, respectively. Consistent with the ELISA
data, CA45 bound EBOV GPCL with higher affinity (sub pico-
molar) than EBOV GPDTM.
We then tested the ability of CA45 to neutralize a replica-
tion competent rVSV pseudotyped with filovirus GP express-
ing GFP (rVSV-GP-GFP). CA45 potently neutralized rVSV-
GP-GFP for EBOV, SUDV, BDBV, and to a lesser extent
RESTV, but not TAFV or LLOV (Figure 2C). We confirmed
that the neutralization is due to inhibition of cellular entry via
a single-round infection assay using a VSV-GP-expressing
luciferase (rVSV-Luc), in which CA45 potently cross-neutral-
ized rVSV-Luc for EBOV, SUDV, and BDBV (Figure 2C). To
examine whether CA45 could neutralize the cathepsin-primed
form of EBOV that mediates membrane fusion, we treated
rVSV-GP viruses with thermolysin to generate particles dis-
playing GPCL. Interestingly, the neutralizing potency of CA45
versus GPCL was dramatically higher (100- to 1,900-fold lower
IC50) compared to full-length GP (Figure 2C), consistent with
the strikingly higher binding affinity of CA45 to GPCL versus
GPDTM. In sharp contrast, KZ52 failed to neutralize cleaved
EBOV (Figure 2C). CA45 neutralization breadth was further
confirmed in plaque reduction neutralization tests using the
authentic ebolaviruses (Figure 2C). As a reference, all reported
and characterized ebolavirus mAbs, along with CA45, are pro-
vided in Table S3.
The contrast between CA45 and KZ52 in neutralization capac-
ity against EBOV bearing cleaved GPCL suggested that KZ52
might act upstream of cathepsin cleavage and CA45 at a step
downstream. We therefore sought to elucidate the step(s) of
entry affected by CA45 and KZ52. As expected, neither CA45
nor KZ52 had any effect on the binding of GPCL to NPC1 (Fig-
ure S1A). We then examined the effect of CA45,KZ52, and the
EBOV mAb100 on cathepsin L cleavage of GPs by western
blot. CA45 showed partial inhibition of cathepsin cleavage,
evidenced by the accumulation of partially cleaved GP spe-
cies and the weaker band of completely cleaved GP (GPCL)
compared to the control antibody, while mAb100 exhibited
nearly complete inhibition as previously reported (Corti et al.,
2016), and KZ52 moderately inhibited the GP cleavage (Fig-
ure S1B). Using a live-cell imaging assay (Spence et al., 2016),
we further evaluated whether CA45 blocks fusion triggering, an
early stage of virus-cell membrane fusion. As shown in Fig-
ure S1C, viral fusion triggering, indicated by membrane lipid
mixing, was not significantly inhibited by CA45, in contrast to
KZ52. Furthermore, no significant difference in co-localization
of internalized virus particles with NPC1 was observed following
incubation of virus and cells with CA45, indicating that CA45
does not affect receptor binding. Collectively, these data sug-
gest that CA45 might block virus entry at two stages: (1) by inhib-
iting cathepsin cleavage and (2) by inhibiting a later stage that is
after receptor binding but prior to productive fusion of the viral
and the endosomal membranes.
A Primary Role for CA45 HC in GP Binding
Analysis of the VH and VL regions of CA45 inferred their cynomol-
gus macaque germline precursors as IGHV4S17 and IGKV1-5,
respectively (Figure 3A). CA45 had a moderate level of somatic
hypermutation (SHM) (9.9% nt and 14% aa for VH, and 7.5%
nt and 14% aa for VL, respectively) and a 19-residue CDRH3
loop (Figure 3A) (Table S4). It is of note that there is one amino
acid deletion in CDRH1 (G30) and that the CDRH3 is flanked
by two negatively charged residues, D95 and D101, and contains
eight hydrophobic residues (F, I, V, W, and L) (Figure 3A), which
might impart molecular recognition of CA45.
We performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis of CA45 CDRs
to examine the role of CDR residues in CA45-GP interaction (Fig-
ures 3B and 3C and Figure S2). Interestingly, only mutations in
CDRH1 and CDRH3 caused dramatic decrease of CA45 binding
to GP, while other mutations had little impact (Figures 3B and 3C
and Figure S2), implying that CA45 HC plays a major role in GP
recognition and LC plays a minor role. Most residues in
CDRH1 and CDRH3 critical for binding are either highly hydro-
phobic or negatively charged (Figure 3C), suggesting that hydro-
phobic interactions and salt bridges might be heavily involved in

 the CA45-GP recognition interface. The neutralization afforded
by the mutants closely mirrored the binding pattern.
We generated germline reverted CA45 (CA45-HGLLGL) based
on the inferred germline sequences to examine the contribution
of SHM to CA45 function. CA45-HGLLGL showed very weak
binding for GPDmuc and no binding to BDBV GPDTM (Fig-
ure 3D and Figure S3) but sub-picomolar affinity to GPCL, indis-
tinguishable from the mature CA45. These data suggest that
GP steric constraints that restrict CA45 germline precursor
from accessing its cognate GP epitope can be eased by the
removal of the MLD and glycan cap. Consistent with a major
role of CA45 HC in GP recognition, CA45-HmLGL, a semi-re-
verted CA45 containing mature HC and germline LC, bound
EBOV GPDmuc with similar affinity as mature CA45 but ex-
hibited 12- and 35-fold poorer affinity to GPs of SUDV and
BDBV, respectively (Figure 3D).
CA45-HGLLGL, failed to neutralize pseudotyped rVSV-GPs,
while the semi-reverted CA45-HmLGL showed detectable but
severely reduced neutralizing potency (Figures S3L–S3N), indi-
cating that the maturation of CA45 LC is important for its func-
tion. Furthermore, CA45-HmLGL retained potent neutralizing ac-
tivity toward rVSV-EBOVCL (IC50 �0.1 nM), while CA45-HGLLGL
failed to exhibit significant neutralization (Figure S3O), suggest-
ing that affinity maturation of CA45 HC is critical for rVSV-
EBOVCL neutralization. The failure of CA45-HGLLGL to neutralize
rVSV-EBOVCL despite its high binding affinity for GPCL (at
neutral pH) suggested that CA45-HGLLGL might fail to bind
GPCL in the acidic environment of endosomes. Consistent with
this hypothesis, the binding of CA45-HGLLGL to GPCL decreased
by over 2 logs at pH 4.5 as compared to at pH 7.5 (Figure S3P),
indicating that maturation of CA45 is needed for GPCL binding in
the endosomes.
The mature CA45 lacks VH residue G30 that exists in the
germline CDRH1, suggesting that the deletion of G30 occurred
during affinity maturation and might be critical for CA45 func-
tion. A mature CA45 variant with a glycine insertion at this
position (CA45-G30) showed severe reduction in binding to GP
and neutralizing activity (Figures S3Q and S3R), with slightly
reduced potency toward EBOVCL (Figure S3S), suggesting that
GPCL could readily recognize CA45-G30, the less mature form
of CA45.
Epitope Mapping of CA45
To determine the GP epitope surface recognized by CA45,
we evaluated the competition between CA45 and a series of
EBOV mAbs with known epitopes by using BLI. CA45 did not
compete with the glycan cap binder 13C6, RBS binder FVM04,
or with FVM02, which binds to the tip of the IFL (Table S5).
However, CA45 strongly competed with KZ52 (Table S5), sug-
gesting that their epitopes are closely positioned, perhaps at
the GP base.
To identify the GP residues critical for CA45 binding, we
evaluated the binding of CA45 and two control mAbs against
a shotgun mutagenesis alanine-scanning library of EBOV GP
in which 641 of 644 GP residues were individually mutated.
The epitope mapping identified residue R64 within the N ter-
minus of GP1, in addition to Y517, G546, and N550 within the
IFL of GP2, as critical for CA45 binding (Figures 4A and 4B).
Compared to wild-type GP, alanine substitutions at these
residues reduced CA45 binding by 98%, 96%, 89%, and
78%, respectively, while the binding of control antibodies,
FVM04 and FVM09, to these mutants was not reduced
(Figure 4B).
These four residues are highly conserved among GPs of all
ebolaviruses (Figure 4C). R64 is located within the b3 strand
at the N terminus of GP1 and is identical between Kikwit,
Mayinga, and Makona strains of EBOV, while other ebolavi-
ruses have a lysine residue at this position. Y517 and G546,
positioned in strands b19 and b20 within the IFL, are identical
among all ebolavirus species (Figure 4C). N550, located in
the b20-a3 (HR1-A) loop, is also conserved among all filovi-
ruses and is shared by the KZ52 epitope (Davidson et al.,
2015). In contrast, except for the residues within b20 and
b20-a3 loop, MARV GP shows little homology in this region
(Figure 4C), consistent with the lack of CA45 binding to
MARV GPs. The key residues are clustered closely within the
base of the GP trimer structure (Figure 4D). In addition, ala sub-
stitution of residue K190 (Figure 4D) also reduced CA45 binding
by 67%, suggesting that K190 might also be important for
CA45 binding.
To further evaluate the conservation of CA45 epitope, we
retrieved sequences of over 1,300 ebolavirus GP variants from
the NCBI Virus Variation Database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/genomes/VirusVariation) (Brister et al., 2014), which con-
tains all the ebolavirus GP variants deposited in GenBank,
including strains circulated in the 2014 West Africa outbreak
(Carroll et al., 2015; Park et al., 2015). We analyzed 231 unique
GP variants and found that the four epitope residues, R64,
Y517, G546, and N550, were all conserved without variations
(Table S6). We also generated additional mutations within the
key CA45 contact sites to evaluate their impact on CA45 binding,
based on GP sequence homology in this region shown in Fig-
ure 4C. Interestingly, only Y517I showed severely reduced
binding to CA45, whereas most of the mutations enhanced
CA45 binding (Figure 4E), and N550Q retained similar binding
(Figure 4E), compared to the wild-type GP. The above stated
GP variant sequence analysis data revealed no mutation at
residue Y517, suggesting that alteration of this residue cannot
be tolerated. Consistent with this notion, Y517A mutation in
the context of a GP-pseudotyped lentivirus strongly reduced
viral replication (B. Doranz, personal communication). Taken
together, the CA45 epitope residues on GP are highly conserved
across the ebolavirus family.
The key CA45 contact sites largely overlap in the overlay
of GPDmuc (5JQ3) and GPCL (5HJ3) structures (Figure S4A),
suggesting that there is no significant difference in their

 configurations on cathepsin-cleaved GP and the uncleaved

referred to as the DFF lid, clearly appear over the CA45 epitope
in GPDmuc structure, while being disordered in GPCL (Fig-
ure S4A). These residues, were reported to block access to the
binding pocket for toremifene, a small molecule inhibitor of
EBOV membrane fusion (Zhao et al., 2016) (Figure S4B). Interest-
ingly, ala substitution of D192, F193, and F194 increased CA45
binding to 170%, 182%, and 224% of wild-type GP, respectively

(Figure S4C), suggesting that the DFF lid
might interfere with CA45 binding to GP.
Displacement of the DFF lid in GPCL might
allow CA45 and its germline precursor to
readily access the cognate epitope.
We cultured VSV-EBOV GP replication
competent virus in the presence of CA45
for four passages to isolate CA45 escape
variants. Ten escape clones were plaque
purified
and
sequenced.
All
escape
clones contained two mutations, A101V
and K588R, with two variants harboring
a
third
mutation
of
either
N643D
or A654T in the GP stalk (Figures S5A
and

These

showed

reduced

binding
(Fig-
ure S5C) or neutralization (Figure S5D).
Interestingly, none of the CA45 GP con-
tact residues identified by alanine-scanning mutagenesis were
mutated in escape variants, suggesting that mutations of these
residues may be detrimental for viral fitness. Neither A101 nor
K588 exposes well on the GP surface, while the orientations of
N643 and A654 are not clear in the existing crystal structures
of GP. The combined mutations likely have a structural impact
on the CA45 binding site. In the GP ala-scanning study, the sin-
gle mutants of A101S, K588A, N643A, or A654S did not show
any significant change in CA45 binding (Figure S5E), suggesting
Cell 169, 891–904, May 18, 2017

 that only combinations of these mutations can lead to escape by
altering the epitope environment (Figure S5B), as both A101
and K588 are in proximity of R64 and Y517, which are critical
for CA45 binding (Figure S5B). As expected, the CA45 escape
mutants were readily neutralized by the RBS binding mAb
FVM04 (Figure S5F).
Electron Microscopy Reconstruction of the GP-CA45
Complex
To further understand how CA45 interacts with GP, we derived a
3D negative stain EM reconstruction of the CA45 Fab-EBOV
GPDTM complex (Figure 5A and Figure S6). CA45 approaches
GP with a nearly perpendicular angle and binds the GP region
proximal to the IFL (Figure 5B). A homology model of CA45
was docked to orient the HC and revealed that the CDRH1 and
CDRH3 loops interact closely with the IFL-surrounding GP resi-
dues (Figure 5C). In this CA45-GP model, CA45-contacting
GP residues R64, Y517, G546, and N550 (Figure 5C, shown in

consistent with the GP alanine-scanning
data (Figure 3C).
Mirroring the binding competition anal-
ysis, the EM data showed that KZ52 Fab
epitope overlaps with that of CA45, but
at a different angle, and contacts some
non-conserved GP residues (Figure 5D).
Conversely, CA45 binds to a more conserved region of filovirus
GP (Figure 5D). Thus, our data reveal the molecular basis for
the expanded neutralization breadth of CA45, which targets a
conserved epitope proximal to those of the EBOV-specific anti-
bodies KZ52, c2G4, and c4G7. (Figure 5E).
In Vivo Protection against EBOV and SUDV in Mice
and Guinea Pigs
Post-exposure in vivo efficacy of CA45 was first tested in mouse
models of EBOV and SUDV. BALB/c mice were infected with
mouse-adapted EBOV followed by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection
of CA45 (10 to 0.5 mg/kg) or PBS as control, 2 days post infection
(dpi). Significant protection from lethality and much lower weight
loss was observed at all CA45 dose levels as compared to the
control group (Figure 6A).
We then tested the efficacy of CA45 in a SUDV model by using
mice deficient for the IFNa receptor (B6.129S2-Ifnar1tm1Agt/
Mmjax) (Brannan et al., 2015). In multiple experiments, mice
898
Cell 169, 891–904, May 18, 2017
 were challenged with SUDV (1,000 pfu) and treated by a single
i.p. injection of mAbs at 1 dpi. CA45 (10 mg/kg) protected five
out of six animals from lethal infection, which exhibited an
average of <6% weight loss as compared to 28% in the PBS
Figure 6. Efficacy in Mouse and Guinea Pig
Models
(A) Groups of 10 or 20 BALB/c mice were infected
with 100 pfu of MA-EBOV and treated with an
i.p. injection of CA45 at indicated doses or PBS at
2 dpi and monitored for 21 days. p values for each
treatment group compared to the PBS group was
determined by Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test.
(B) IFNAR�/� mice were infected with 1,000 pfu of
SUDV and treated at 1 dpi with an i.p. injection of
either PBS, FVM04, CA45, or FVM04+CA45 at
indicated doses, and monitored for 21 days.
(C) Hartley guinea pigs were infected with 1,000
LD50 of GPA-EBOV and treated at 3 dpi by i.p. in-
jection of FVM04, CA45, the cocktail (n = 6), or
PBS (n = 4) and monitored for 28 days. p values:
CA45 versus PBS, p = 0.0018; FVM04 versus PBS,
p = 0.0018; cocktails versus PBS p < 0.0001;
CA45 versus cocktails, p = 0.0079; FVM04 versus
cocktails, p < 0.0001.

group (Figure 6B, upper panel). We previ-
ously demonstrated that RBS binding
mAb FVM04 afforded partial protection
in this model (Howell et al., 2016). To
examine whether combining a receptor
blocker with a fusion inhibitor might yield
greater efficacy, we combined FVM04
and CA45 at 5 mg/kg each (Figure 6B
upper panel) or 5 mg/kg of FVM04
plus 2.5 mg/kg of CA45 (Figure 6B,
lower panel). Both combinations provided
100%
protection
in
independent
ex-
periments. Interestingly, cocktail-treated
mice showed no weight loss or other
signs of disease, unlike those treated
with single mAbs (Figure 6B).
Furthermore,
we
tested
CA45
or
FVM04 alone or in combination in a strin-
gent guinea pig model of EBOV infec-
tion, in which a single dose of mAb
was delivered at 3 dpi. Guinea pigs in-
fected with 1,000 LD50 of guinea-pig-
adapted
EBOV
(GPA-EBOV)
were
treated with either FVM04 or CA45 at
5 mg/animal, a combination of the two
mAbs at 2.5 or 5 mg each, or PBS. All
cocktail-treated
animals
survived
the
infection with no sign of disease or
weight
loss
(Figure 6C), while PBS-
treated animals all died with a mean
time to death (MTD) of 7.5 days and
21% body weight loss. Monotherapy with 5 mg of FVM04 or
CA45 provided partial protection of 17% (MTD: 11.5 days)
and 50% (MTD: 20.5 days) of the animals, with maximal
weight loss of 9.2% and 1.2%, respectively (Figure 6C). The
Cell 169, 891–904, May 18, 2017

 protection afforded by either monotherapy or combination was
significantly better than that afforded by PBS treatment in
guinea pigs (p = 0.0018 and p < 0.0001, respectively). Further-
more, combination therapy was significantly better than mono-
therapy with CA45 (p = 0.0079) or FVM04 (p < 0.0001). These
data, combined with the lack of weight loss in cocktail-treated
groups, indicate that combining the two mAbs strongly en-
hances the efficacy.
We then evaluated whether CA45 alone could also protect
against SUDV in guinea pigs. As shown in Figure 6D, similar to
our previous data with FVM04 (Howell et al., 2016), 5 mg CA45
at 3 dpi protected all animals from lethal infection with GPA-
SUDV without any weight loss, while all control guinea pigs
died within 14 dpi (p < 0.0001) and lost up to 25% of their
body weight (Figure 6D).
Protective Efficacy in Ferrets
A ferret model was recently developed that exhibits many fea-
tures of filovirus disease in humans (Kozak et al., 2016). Since
guinea pig studies indicated that a combination of CA45 and
FVM04 is optimal for effective control of EBOV infection, we
tested this cocktail in the BDBV ferret model. A group of
two male and two female ferrets were infected with 253
TCID50 of BDBV and treated at 3 and 6 dpi with 20 mg of
each antibody by i.p. injection. Two infected ferrets received
PBS at the same time points as control. All four treated ani-
mals survived with no clinical signs of disease (Figures 7A
and 7B). One animal (888M) who experienced an unrelated
accident on 21 dpi, leading to paralysis of both hind legs
and failure to reach food and water, was euthanized on 22
dpi. Among the treated animals, the male ferrets (808M and
888M) showed steady weight gain and no detectable virus in
the blood, while the female animals exhibited less weight
gain with moderate and transient viremia at �104 GEQ/mL
on day 6. Control animals succumbed to infection 7 dpi and
displayed very high viremia (�1010 GEQ/mL) (Figures 7C and
7D). High viral load was also detected in oral, nasal, and rectal
swabs of both control animals but none of the treated ferrets
(Figures 7E–7G).
Blood chemistry analysis showed a drastic rise in circulating
levels of alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, total
bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, and potassium in control animals
(Figure 7H–7L), similar to the disease course in humans and
NHPs (Feldmann and Geisbert, 2011), while these parameters
remained unaffected in treated animals (Figure 7H–7L). Com-
plete blood count (CBC) analysis showed a drop in white blood
cell count, and a drastic reduction in total lymphocyte and
platelet counts, which rapidly rebound only in treated animals
(Figure S7). The complete results of the blood chemistry and
CBC analysis are shown in Figure S7.

 DISCUSSION
In this study, we identified a novel bNAb (CA45) from immunized
NHP B cell repertoire, which targets a key site of vulnerability
within the highly conserved ebolavirus IFL. Recently, a mouse-
derived bNAb targeting ebolavirus IFL (Furuyama et al., 2016),
as well as bNAbs targeting the fusion peptides of HIV-1 envelope
(Env) GPs (Kong et al., 2016; van Gils et al., 2016) and influenza A
hemagglutinins (Joyce et al., 2016; Kallewaard et al., 2016), have
been reported. The progressively emerging bNAbs specific for
fusion peptides of various viruses implies mechanistic conver-
gence of host immunity against a conserved functional vulnera-
bility. CA45 neutralizes four out of five ebolaviruses and displays
protective efficacy in animal models of Ebola, Sudan, and Bun-
dibugyo viruses. CA45 exhibits unique features with respect to
its pattern of reactivity to various forms of GP, properties of its
germline precursor, and its conserved epitope that have impor-
tant implications for the design of pan-ebolavirus vaccines and
therapeutics.
CA45 was isolated from cynomolgus macaque, a species with
Ig gene composition highly homologous to humans, suggesting
that immunization can elicit bNAbs targeting conserved and
vulnerable ebolavirus epitopes in primates including humans.
Our findings indicate that memory B cells that encode ebolavirus
bNAbs are of low frequency, accounting for �1% of the GP-spe-
cific and �0.005% of total memory B cells, consistent with the
observation in previous studies that the protective responses
to prototypical ebolavirus vaccines are mostly strain specific
(Mire et al., 2013). This might relate to low precursor frequency
and/or inefficient activation of such precursors by the vaccine.
Indeed, we observed very poor binding of the CA45 germline
precursor (CA45-HGLLGL) to wild-type GP. However, CA45-HGL
LGL bound with high affinity to the endosomal form of GP (GPCL),
which might relate to augmented accessibility of the cognate
epitope and/or subtle epitope conformational changes in GPCL
without MLD and glycan cap. Use of GPDMuc immunogen cock-
tail lacking MLD in this study may have contributed to the elicita-
tion of these rare B cell precursors. Recently, optimized HIV Env
immunogens have been designed that, unlike wild-type Env,
effectively elicit precursors of HIV-1 bNAbs (Jardine et al., 2013;
McGuire et al., 2016; Sok et al., 2016). The proteolytically remod-
eled GPCL represents a germline-targeting immunogen that could
efficiently trigger CA45-like precursor B cells and lead to poly-
clonal cross protective responses at improved titers.
The prototypic ebolavirus neutralizing epitope, the so-called
base epitope, is targeted by EBOV-specific antibodies such as
KZ52 (Lee et al., 2008), c2G4, and c4G7 (Murin et al., 2014), as
well as SUDV-specific mAbs 16F6 (Dias et al., 2011). This
epitope consists of residues at the GP1-GP2 interface within
the base of the trimeric GP, with no cross-neutralizing mAb tar-
geting this epitope previously reported. CA45 competes with
base binders, targets the IFL, and contacts residues in both
GP1 and GP2 with a footprint that partially overlaps the base
epitope, while approaching GP at an angle tilted toward the tip
of the IFL, as compared to KZ52 (Figures 4D and 5D). The foot-
print of CA45 defines a conserved epitope (Figure 4C) encom-
passing (1) the b3 strand at the N terminus of GP1 as well as
(2) b19 and b20 strands forming the stem of the IFL on GP2.
The most critical interaction residues within the CA45 epitope,
R64, Y517, and G546, line up in a cluster along the IFL, between
the KZ52 binding site and the fusion peptide (the IFL tip) (Fig-
ure 4D). The ability to simultaneously bind both GP1 and GP2
is shared between CA45 and other described base binders.
Interestingly, another IFL mAb, FVM02, that binds to the tip of
IFL with no GP1 contact lacks neutralizing activity (Keck et al.,
2015), suggesting that clamping GP1 and GP2 at the trimer
base may be critical for effective neutralization of ebolaviruses.
Despite the relationship between the CA45 and KZ52 epitope,
the mechanistic differences between these two classes of anti-
bodies are striking. CA45 appears to function at two levels:
partially inhibiting the GP cleavage, an early critical step in filovi-
rus entry, and blocking the virus entry post-cleavage while KZ52
is completely inactive after GP cleavage. These observations
suggest a two-punch mechanism of action by CA45 on early
and late stages of the entry process.
In the crystal structure of EBOV GP (5JQ3) (Zhao et al., 2016), a
cluster of residues within the cathepsin cleavage loop (D192/
F193/F194) hovers over the CA45 epitope. Alanine substitution
of these residues enhanced GP binding to CA45, suggesting
that these residues might restrict access to the CA45 epitope
in the GP trimer. Interestingly, this region is not traceable in the
GPCL structure, suggesting that it is either highly disordered or
is removed by thermolysin (Bornholdt et al., 2016a), possibly ex-
plaining the dramatically increased binding affinity of GPCL for
both mature and germline CA45. Mutagenesis of these residues
and cleavage by cathepsin might have similar effects on expo-
sure of the CA45 epitope. The ability of this so-called DFF lid
to block access to both the viral GP inhibitor toremifene (Zhao
et al., 2016) and the CA45 binding epitope further suggests
that this epitope is a major site of vulnerability and that CA45
and toremifene might be acting by a shared, yet to be defined,
mechanism of action. In addition to the DFF lid, alanine substitu-
tion of the N40 glycosylation site (N40A and T42A) also increased
CA45 binding. Collectively, these data further suggest that
modifying the exposure of such epitopes may help expand
the breadth of ebolavirus vaccines. Thus, future strategies
aiming at expanding the bNAb memory B cells should focus
on designing immunogens and regimens that enhance the
epitope exposure and elicitation of such rare precursors. Such
modifications could include deletion of MLD, removal of the
glycan cap, and potentially further resurfacing to enhance the
immunogen binding to precursors for other bNAbs, such as
those binding to the RBS or the stalk.
CA45, delivered at the peak of viremia, displayed full protective
efficacy against EBOV infection in mice and 50% protection in a
highly stringent EBOV guinea pig model. Given the distinct mech-
anisms of action of CA45 and FVM04 at different stages of the
entry process, we hypothesized that a cocktail of the two mAbs
targeting multiple steps of ebolavirus entry would be more effec-
tive. Consistent with this hypothesis, a cocktail of FVM04 and
CA45 was fully protective in guinea pigs against EBOV. Similarly,
the cocktail provided superior protective efficacy in an IFNAR�/�
mouse model against wild-type (non-adapted) SUDV. In the
guinea pig model of SUDV infection, CA45 alone was fully protec-
tive against GPA-SUDV. Furthermore, two doses of the CA45/
FVM04 cocktail were fully protective in BDBV-infected ferrets,
Cell 169, 891–904, May 18, 2017
901
 evidenced by the lack of mortality and absence of all clinical and
laboratory symptoms of the disease. Thus, this cocktail repre-
sents a post-exposure antibody therapeutic that is fully protec-
tive against all three highly pathogenic ebolaviruses.
During infection, ebolaviruses produce large amounts of sGP,
the product of the unedited GP gene that lacks MLD and GP2 (de
La Vega et al., 2015). sGP is considered a decoy antigen that ab-
sorbs apex-binding antibodies. However, it is not clear whether
sGP plays a direct role in pathogenesis (de La Vega et al., 2015).
Nevertheless, currently all antibody cocktails that significantly
protected against EBOV in NHPs include an sGP binding anti-
body (Corti et al., 2016; Pettitt et al., 2013; Qiu et al., 2016; Qiu
et al., 2012; Qiu et al., 2014). Thus, it remains enigmatic whether
sGP binding is a positive or negative attribute of an immunother-
apeutic cocktail targeting ebolaviruses. Our findings demon-
strate that the addition of the cross-reactive sGP-binding mAb
FVM04 significantly improves the protective efficacy against
EBOV. It is possible that only the excess FVM04 unbound by
sGP is responsible for improved efficacy. Alternatively, FVM04
might neutralize a yet to be defined function of sGP that could
play a role in ebolavirus pathogenicity. A sGP-binding therapeu-
tic mAb may also relieve the emerging apex-binding antibodies
produced by the host, which could help control the infection.
In summary, we report a conserved ebolavirus neutralizing
epitope exploited by NHP-derived bNAb CA45, which overlaps
with the ebolavirus IFL. We further demonstrate that an antibody
cocktail targeting this epitope together with the RBS can pro-
vide broad protection against all three ebolaviruses that have
epidemic potential and high mortality in humans. Furthermore,
we show that modifications of the GP immunogen enhancing
accessibility of antigenic surfaces in the base region of GP can
substantially augment the reactivity to bNAb CA45 and its in-
ferred germline precursors, an important finding that can inform
improved design of broadly protective filovirus vaccines.

 Mouse Challenge Studies with EBOV
All mice were healthy, immune competent and drug and test naive. Mice were housed in microisolater cages and provided chow and
water ad libitum. 6-8 week old, female BALB/c mice were given 100 PFU of mouse-adapted EBOV (Mayinga) diluted in PBS, via the IP
route. Littermates of the same sex were randomly assigned to experimental groups. Antibodies were administered IP at indicated
time points and dosage. Control mice were given PBS. Mice were observed through day 21 for clinical signs of disease such as hy-
poactivity, reduced grooming, and weight loss. When signs of disease were noted, observations were increased to two times a day.
Moribund and surviving mice were humanely euthanized accordingly to IACUC-approved criteria.
Mouse Challenge Studies with SUDV
All mice were healthy but have an inherent immunodeficiency due to lack of IFNa receptor. All mice were drug and test naive. Mice
were housed in microisolater cages and provided chow and water ad libitum. Male and female IFNAR�/� mice (4-5 weeks old) were
exposed by IP infection to 1,000 PFUs of SUDV (Boniface) and treated with antibodies at indicated time points and doses. Littermates
of the same sex were randomly assigned to experimental groups. Control mice were given PBS. Mice were observed for clinical signs
of disease daily and moribund and surviving mice were humanely euthanized according to IACUC-approved criteria.
Guinea Pig Challenge Studies with EBOV and SUDV
All guinea pigs were healthy and immune competent as per vendor’s representation. All guinea pigs were drug and test naive. Animals
were monitored daily for food and water consumption and given environmental enrichment according to the guidelines for the spe-
cies. Cleaning of the animals was completed three times per week which included a complete cage and bedding material change.
Animals were kept 2 or 3 per cage in the large shoe box cages from IVC Alternative Design. Each unit is ventilated with a HEPA blower
system. 4-6 week old female Hartley guinea pigs (250-300 g) were randomly assigned to experimental groups and challenged via IP
with a 1000 x LD50 of guinea pig adapted EBOV or 1000 x LD50 guinea pig adapted SUDV in 1 mL of DMEM. CA45 and/or FVM04 were
given at indicated time points and doses, with 6 guinea pigs/group (n = 6). Control guinea pigs with 4 animals/group (n = 4), were given
PBS treatment. Animal were observed for clinical signs of disease, survival and weight change for 15-16 days, while survival was
monitored for an additional 12 days.
Ferrets Challenge Studies with BDBV
All ferrets were clinically free from symptoms of any contagious, infections, or communicable disease. Animals received rabies vac-
cine Imrab-3 when they reached 2-3 months old. All animals were drug and test naive. Animals were monitored daily for food and
water consumption and given environmental enrichment according to the guidelines for the species. Cleaning of the animals was
completed three times per week which included a complete cage and bedding material change. Animals were kept 2 or 3 per
cage in the Allentown Caging system. Each unit was ventilated with a HEPA blower system. All units were autoclavable and stainless
steel in structure. Ferret challenge studies were performed as previously described (Kozak et al., 2016). Briefly, 6-month old male
and female ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) (620-960 g) were infected by intramuscular route with 253 TCID50 of Bundibugyo virus/
H.sapiens-wt/UGA/2007 (BDBV) (GenBank: KR063673.1). Group assignments were random for each sex. Antibody treatment
was given to animals via IP route on 3 and 6 dpi. Animals were monitored daily and clinical scoring was recorded. Blood, oral, rectal
swabs, and nasal wash samples were collected at �1, 3, 6, 10, 14, 21, and 27 dpi. Blood cell counts and serum chemistry assays
were performed following the manufacturer’s instructions using a VetScan HM5 hematology machine (Abaxis, USA) and VetScan
VS2 analyzer (Abaxis, USA), respectively. Viral RNA was extracted using the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (QIAGEN) following the man-
ufacturer’s instructions. Samples viral loads were determined using reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) with an ABI
StepOnePlus instrument as described previously (Kozak et al., 2016).
Cell Lines
HEK293T (human [Homo sapiens] fetal kidney), Vero (African green monkey [Chlorocebus aethiops] kidney), U2OS (human [Homo
sapiens] bone), and BHK-21 (Syrian golden hamster [Mesocricetus auratus] kidney) cells were all obtained from ATCC (https://
www.atcc.org/). HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum and 100 I.U./mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin. Vero and BHK-21 cells were cultured in Eagle’s Minimum Essential
Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 I.U./mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin. U2OS cells were
cultured in McCoy’s 5a medium (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 I.U./mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL strep-
tomycin. All cell lines were incubated at 37�C with 5% CO2.
NHP PBMCs
The sera and PBMCs described in this study were collected from a cynomolgus macaque (macaque 20667, 3 years old male), who
received three immunizations (on days 0, 28, and 56) with a mixture of filovirus GPDmuc. The animal was prescreened to ensure lack
of exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV), Simian T-Lymphotropic Virus-1 (STLV-1), Mac-
acacine herpesvirus 1 (Herpes B virus), and Simian Retrovirus (SRV1 and SRV2) before immunization. Prior testing history of the
NHP#20667 was unknown. The time point of the PBMCs used for the subsequent single B cell sorting was day 84, 28 days post
the 3rd immunization. Detailed information on these has been previously reported (Keck et al., 2015).

 Viruses
Recombinant Indiana VSV (rVSV) expressing filovirus GP were generated as previously described (Howell et al., 2016; Miller et al.,
2012; Ng et al., 2014; Wong et al., 2010). HEK293T cells were grown to 80% confluency before transfection with EBOV-GP pCAGGS,
SUDV-GP pcDNA, or BDBV-GP pCAGGS using FuGENE HD (Promega). Cells were culture overnight at 37�C with 5% CO2.The next
day, the media was removed and rVSV-G virus (kerafast) was used to infect the cells in DMEM at an MOI of 3 for 1 hr before washing
the cells with 1X DPBS three times. DMEM supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum and 100 I.U./mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL strep-
tomycin was added to the infected cells and they were culture overnight as described above. The next day, the supernatant was har-
vest and clarified by centrifugation at 300xg for 10 min before aliquoting and storing at �80�C. To titrate the pseudotyped viruses,
BHK-21 cells were seeded at 2.7x105 cells/mL in EMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 I.U./mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL
streptomycin in 6-well plates (Corning) overnight. The final volume was 3 mL per well. The next day, cells were 80% confluent
and were transfected with VSV-G pCAGGS using FuGENE HD (Promega). Cells were culture overnight at 37�C with 5% CO2. The
next day, the media was removed and a dilution of virus 10�1 to 10�8 in serum free EMEM was added to each well for 1 hr before
layering each well with DMEM containing 0.9% agar. The agar was allowed to cool completely before returning plates to the incubator
as described above. The next day, cells were fixed with 5% glutaraldehyde before removing agar and staining with crystal violet for
30 min. Afterward, the crystal violet was removed and plates washed with water before counting viral plaques. VSV pseudotypes with
GPCL were generated by incubating rVSV pseudotype bearing full-length GP with 3x w/w thermolysin (Sigma) in 1X PBS for 1 hr at
37�C, followed by quenching with 1 mM phosphoramidon (Peptide International). Cleavage of GP was verified by SDS-PAGE.
METHOD DETAILS
Isolation of MAbs by Single-Cell Sorting
Pan-ebola GP-specific memory B cell sorting and Ig encoding gene PCR amplification was performed following a previously
described macaque single memory B cell sorting and cloning method with modifications (Sundling et al., 2012; Wang et al.,
2016b). Briefly, PBMC were incubated with a cocktail of antibodies to CD3 (APC-Cy7; SP34-2, BD PharMingen), CD8 (Pacific
blue; RPA-T8, BD PharMingen), CD14 (BV605; M5E2, BD Horizon), CD20 (PE-Alexa Fluor 700; 2H7, VRC), CD27 (PE-Cy7;
M-T271, BD PharMingen), IgG (FITC; G18-145, BD PharMingen), and IgM (PE-Cy5; G20-12, BD PharMingen), and Aqua blue (Invi-
trogen) to exclude dead cells. EBOV GPDmuc with His-tag and SUDV GPDmuc with HA-tag, produced in insect cell and mammalian
293F cells, respectively, were used to identify antigen-specific memory B cells at 4 mg/mL in the cocktail. After 1 hr of staining at 4�C,
the cells were washed with cold PBS and 10 mL of each of anti-His-PE and anti-HA-APC (Miltenyi) were added in total volume of
100 mL for 1 hr at 4�C. Cross-reactive GP-specific memory B cells were sorted on a FACS Aria III cell sorter (BD Biosciences) to obtain
single cells with the phenotype of CD20+IgG+CD14- Aqua Blue-CD3-CD8-CD27+IgM-EBOV_GPDmuc-PEhiSUDV_GPDmuc-APChi.
Single cells were sorted into 96-well PCR plates containing lysis buffer followed by single B cell RT-PCR. We performed cloning
and expression of IgGs using the previously described method (Tiller et al., 2008).
Expression and Purification of Antibody, Fab Fragment, and GP Proteins
The genes of CA45 heavy chain, light chain, were cloned into IgG1 expression vectors, produced in FreeStyle 293F cells, and purified
by protein A column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) following the manufacturer’s protocol as described previously (Wang et al.,
2016b). CA45 Fab was prepared by subcloning the heavy-chain gene into a Fab expression vector with an additional 6xHis-tag to
the C terminus (Tran et al., 2014). For Octet studies, CA45 Fab was generated from whole IgG using the Peirce Fab kit (ThermoFisher)
according to the manufacturers’ recommendations. CA45 was digested with agarose bound papain for 6 hr at 37�C before purifica-
tion by Protein A column chromatography to remove undigested IgG and Fc from the reaction. The unbound fraction containing CA45
Fab was dialyzed overnight in PBS at 4�C before analysis by non-reducing SDS-PAGE. All proteins were further purified by size exclu-
sion chromatography (SEC).
GP protein expression was performed as previously described (Howell et al., 2016). EBOV, SUDV, RESTV, and BDBV full ectodo-
mains (GPDTM) were expressed in Sf9 insect cells through baculovirus transfer vectors (pFastBac, Invitrogen). Constructs contained
amino acids residues 1 to 605 followed by a C-terminal 6X histidine tag under the polyhedron late promotor and simian virus 40 (SV40)
polyadenylation site. Bacmid DNA was generated by in vivo transpositions in E. coli and used to transfect Sf9 cells. The recombinant
baculoviruses containing the GPDTM were recovered the supernatants and amplified in Sf9 cells. The resulting virus was used to
infect Sf9 cells, and proteins were collected from the supernatants 3 days after infection. The supernatant was concentrated
10-fold and mixed with 2 mM CaCl2, 0.25 mM Ni2+, 20% glycerol, 10 mM imidazole, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 M NaCl (final concentration),
and pH adjusted to 7.2 with 5 N NaOH. Nickle beads (Ni Sepharose 6 FastFlow, GE Lifesciences) were added to the supernatants
overnight at 4�C and then separated by centrifugation. The beads were resuspended and packed into a Bio-Rad Econo column and
washed with buffer containing 10 mM imidazole. Proteins were eluted with 500 mM imidazole and proteins dialyzed against PBS
with 10% glycerol, arginine, glutamic acid pH 7.4. For sGP production, the full coding sequence of sGP followed by a 6-histadine
tag was expressed in 293T cells. The delta peptide was separated from sGP in the supernatant using a nickel column. The flow
through containing only sGP was concentrated. All proteins were analyzed by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay, SDS-PAGE and west-
ern blot.

 EBOV GPCL was produced by thermolysin cleavage of EBOV GPDTM as previously described (Hashiguchi et al., 2015). A 3x
amount w/w of thermolysin (Sigma) in 1X PBS was mixed with the GPDTM for 1 hr at 37�C, followed by quenching with 1 mM phos-
phoramidon (Peptide International). Cleavage of GP was verified by SDS-PAGE.
ELISA Binding Assays
Filovirus GPs lacking the transmembrane domain (GPDTM), EBOV GPCL, or EBOV sGP were coated onto 96-well Maxisorb ELISA
plates at 100 ng/well diluted in DPBS overnight at 4�C. On the following day, the plates were washed three times with 300 mL of
1X DPBST (0.05% Tween-20) and blocked with StartingBlock Buffer (Thermo Scientific) for 1 hr at room temperature. After blocking,
plates were washed as described above before adding CA45 diluted into 1X DPBST (0.05% Tween-20) at pH 7.5, 5.5 or 4.5 for 1 hr at
room temperature. After incubation, plates were washed as described above and a 1:3000 dilution of goat anti-human-HRP (KPL)
diluted in StartingBlock Buffer was added for 1 hr at room temperature before a final wash and the addition of 3,30,5,50-Tetramethyl-
benzidine (TMB) substrate (Life Technologies) for 30 min. Plates were read at an optical density of 650 nm on a VersaMax plate
reader. Softmax was used to fit the data to a 4PL curve.
BioLayer Interferometry
Kinetics experiments were performed using the ForteBio Octet Red96 platform. All data were collected at 25�C with orbital shaking at
1,000 rpm in 200 mL in 96-well black flat bottom plates (Greiner Bio-one). For CA45 IgG kinetics, reagents were diluted in 1X kinetics
buffer (1X PBS, 0.01% BSA and 0.002% Tween-20) supplied by ForteBio. Protein G sensors (ForteBio) were equilibrated for 10 min in
1X kinetics buffer prior to loading with 5 mg/mL of CA45 for 2 min. After the loading step, a 30 s baseline in 1X kinetics buffer was
established before association with a range of concentrations of GPDTM for EBOV, SUDV, BDBV, or RESTV or EBOV GPCL for
5 min. Following CA45 association with GP, there was a 10- minute of dissociation step in kinetics buffer. For CA45 Fab kinetics,
all reagents were diluted in 100 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% Tween-20 pH 6.0 to reduce non-specific binding.
His-tagged EBOV GPDTM was loaded onto pre-wet Ni-NTA sensors (ForteBio) for 120 s, followed by a 60 s baseline and then
association with a range of CA45 Fab concentrations. The association step was followed by a 10 min dissociation step. For all ex-
periments, a reference sensor without ligand was used to account for nonspecific binding of analyte to the sensor. All data were fit
globally to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model using data analysis software 9.0 (ForteBio).
rVSV GP-GFP Neutralization Assay
For neutralization, rVSV-GP was incubated with mAbs in serial dilutions for 1 hr at room temperature before infecting a monolayer of
Vero cells in 96-well plates. Infectivity of rVSVs were measured by counting eGFP-positive cells 12-14 hr post infection and normal-
ized to control wells without antibody.
rVSV-GP Luciferase Neutralization Assay
Neutralization assays were performed as previously described (Howell et al., 2016). Vero cells were seeded at 60,000 cells/well and
cultured overnight in EMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 I.U./mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin at
37�C and 5% CO2. The next day, a serial dilution of antibody was incubated with pseudotyped virus in serum free EMEM for 1 hr at
room temperature before infecting Vero cells at an MOI of 0.04 at 37�C, 5% CO2 for 1 hr. After infection, 50% v/v EMEM medium
supplemented with 2% FBS, and 100 I.U./mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin was added to cells. The next day, cells were
lysed with Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) for 30 min at room temperature before the addition of the Luciferase Activating Reagent
(Promega). The luminesce was read immediately on a Biotek Plate reader. Percent neutralization was calculated based on wells
containing virus only. Data were fit to a 4PL curve in GraphPad Prism 6.
Gene Family Usage of IgG Gene
The gene family usage of the variable region of the IgG heavy- and light-chains was analyzed using IgBlast (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/igblast/) with KABAT as the V domain delineation system and a customized cynomolgus macaques Ig heavy- and light-chain
germline database annotated based on the published cynomolgus macaques genomic dataset (Ebeling et al., 2011; Yan et al.,
2011; Yu et al., 2016).
CA45 Heavy- and Light-Chains Alanine Scanning
A panel of 63 alanine (Ala) mutants of CA45 was generated, with each amino acid residue in the heavy chain and light chain comple-
mentarity-determining regions (CDRs; subdomain delineated by Kabat system through IgBlast as described above) substituted by
Ala, with the exception of Ala residues already present in the WT sequence. Each mutant HC or LC was paired with their correspond-
ing WT HC or LC and co-transfected into FreeStyle 293F cells, with the culture supernatants collected four days later for binding
analysis.
The dilution factor of the Ala mutant supernatants has been optimized by pilot ELISA to reach OD450 value from 0.6-1.5. Maxisorp
ELISA plates (Nunc) were coated with 2 mg/mL of GP proteins (EBOV, SUDV or BDBV) for detecting GP binding or AffiniPure Donkey
anti-Human IgG, Fcg fragment (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs) for normalizing IgG expression, respectively in PBS (pH 7.4) at 4�C
overnight. After incubation with blocking buffer (BB, 2% non-fat milk, 5% FBS in PBS), the WT or mutant supernatant in 5-fold serial
e6
Cell 169, 891–904.e1–e8, May 18, 2017
 dilution in BB was added and incubated for 1 hr at 37�C. The secondary Ab, HRP-conjugated goat anti-human Fab (Jackson Immu-
noResearch Labs), and TMB solution (Life Technologies) were used to develop signal. OD450 value for GP-bindings were normalized
with corresponding IgG expression OD450 value, and relative GP binding affinity were calculated for each Ala mutant compared with
the WT supernatant value.
Epitope Mapping of GP Using Alanine Scanning Mutagenesis
A shotgun mutagenesis library of full-length EBOV GP (Mayinga-76) expressed in HEK293 cells was used to determine the critical GP
residues for CA45 binding, as previously described (Howell et al., 2016). In this library, clones with single point mutations spanning
residues 33-767 are mutated to alanine (and alanine to serine). Clones are transfected into HEK293T cells in 384-well plates and
allowed to express for 22 hr. Cells are then incubated with CA45 (or control antibodies) followed by a secondary antibody conjugated
to Alexa Fluor 488. After washing cells, fluorescence is measured using Intellicyt high throughput flow cytometer (Intellicyt, Albuquer-
que, NM). Background fluorescence was subtracted from control wells, and mAb reactivity to each GP mutant was calculated relative
to WT GP fluorescence.
Electron Microscopy, Image Processing, and 3D Reconstruction
EBOV GPDTM was incubated with 6 molar excess of CA45 Fab overnight at 4�C. The complex was purified through an S200i SEC
column (GE Healthcare). The sample was added to 400 square copper mesh grids coated with carbon and stained with 2% uranyl
formate. The grids were imaged on a 120keV Tecnai Spirit electron microscope using a TemCam F416 4k x 4k CCD. Particles were
selected from raw micrographs using DoGPicker (Voss et al., 2009) through the Appion interface (Lander et al., 2009). Particles were
then organized into stacks and aligned using iterative MRA/MSA (Ogura et al., 2003). After making clean 2D stack of particles, EMAN2
(Tang et al., 2007) was used to refine a final 3D model. Crystal structures were docked into the reconstruction using UCSF Chimera
(Pettersen et al., 2004).
Cathepsin Cleavage Inhibition Assay
The viral envelope of rVSV-EBOV GP virions were labeled with biotin using a function-spacer-lipid construct (FSL-biotin) (Sigma-Al-
drich) at neutral pH for 1 hr at 37�C, as described previously (Ng et al., 2014). The labeled virus stock was then acidified to pH �5.5 by
addition of 10X 2-[N-morpholino]ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer. Virions were diluted and aliquoted into a PCR plate. Biotin-labeled
virions were pre-incubated with 1000 nM of test antibody for 1 hr at 37�C at pH 5.5. Virion-antibody complexes were then subjected to
proteolysis by recombinant human Cathepsin L (R&D Systems) at 4 ng/mL for 30 min at 37�C. The reaction was stopped by the addi-
tion of E64 inhibitor (Peptides International) followed by dilution into 1X PBS buffer, pH 7.4. Samples were analyzed by western blot
using h21D10 monoclonal antibody (Holtsberg et al., 2015) directly conjugated to horseradish peroxidase.
Live Cell Imaging
Live imaging was performed as previously described on a Zeiss AxioObserver.Z1 widefield epifluorescence microscope equipped
with a heated environmental chamber, 40x/1.3NA objective, and DAPI/FITC/Texas Red/Cy5 filters (Spence et al., 2016). Briefly, pu-
rified DiD-labeled VSV expressing full-length EBOV GP was incubated with 100 mg/mL CA45 in imaging buffer for 1 hr at 37�C. Virus
was spinoculated at 4�C and 1500 x g for 20 min onto pre-chilled U2OS cell monolayers seeded on glass coverslip dishes (MatTek).
Following the removal of unbound virus, dishes were immediately mounted in the microscope, and warm imaging buffer (140 mM
NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES, 5 mM glucose, 2 mg/mL Hoechst 33342, and 2% FBS, pH 7.4)
was added to mark the start of experiments. Images were taken every 6 s over a two-hour period. To examine viral trafficking, anti-
body-treated DiD-labeled virus was spinoculated onto U2OS cells stably expressing monomeric NeonGreen-tagged NPC1. Cells
were imaged live at 45 min after warming to 37�C. Data were compiled from three independent experiments, and co-localization anal-
ysis was performed using Volocity (Perkin Elmer) software as described previously (Spence et al., 2016).
Analysis of Ebolavirus GP Variant Sequences
We downloaded ebolavirus GP variant sequences from ebolavirus database under NCBI virus variation resource (https://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/genomes/VirusVariation/Database/nph-select.cgi?cmd=database&taxid=186536) using the following criteria:
Select sequence type: Protein (Full-length sequences only: uncheck)
Species: any
Host: any
Region/Country: any
Genome region: Spike glycoprotein
Isolation source: any
Collapsed identical sequences: checked
We initially recovered 1359 GP sequences, with 231 unique sequences remained for further analysis after the collapse and removal
of identical sequences. Multiple sequence alignment of these 231 GP sequences was performed using MUSCLE version 3.8.31
Cell 169, 891–904.e1–e8, May 18, 2017
e7
 (Edgar, 2004a, b). The GP residues of interest were then inspected based on the GP sequence alignment, using EBOV Mayinga GP
numbering system.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
For animal studies, Kaplan Meier survival curves were analyzed with the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test using Prism 6 software (GraphPad
Software, La Jolla, CA). Individual animal experiments were performed with 10 mice per group (n = 10). In some instances, data from
multiple experiments with identical conditions are combined in one Kaplan Meier curve and analyzed statistically (where indicated
in figure legends with n > 10). For alanine scanning mutagenesis of GP the error bars represent the mean and range of at least
two replicate data points. For ELISA and neutralization data each data point is represented as average of triplicates ± SD. For virus
neutralization data, each data point represents the average of three wells run in triplicate ± SD.
DATA AND SOFTWARE AVAILABILITY
For evaluation of epitope conservation sequences for 1,300 ebolavirus GP variants were retrieved from the NCBI Virus Variation Data-
base: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/VirusVariation. The sequences of CA45 antibody reported in this paper have been
deposited at GenBank (GenBank: KY859862, KY859863). The CA45 EM data have been deposited at EMDB (EMDB: EMD-8694).

(A) Overlay of EBOV GPDmuc (PDB: 5JQ3, green) and GPCL (PDB: 5HJ3, blue). The DFF lid (D192, F192, F193) shown in yellow in GPDmuc is disordered and
untraceable in GPCL structure. (B) The structure of EBOV GP bound to toremifene (cyan) (PDB: 5JQ7) with displaced and disordered DFF lid and dispositioned
K191 (compared to A). (C) CA45 shows enhanced binding to each of single alanine substitutions within the DFF lid compared to WT GP.
 Figure S5. CA45 Escape Mutants, Related to Figure 4
Four rounds of selection were performed by growing VSV-EBOV GP in presence of CA45 and virus from fourth passage was plaque purified and 10 clones
sequenced.
(A) Position of identified mutations in 10 CA45 resistant clones.
(B) Position of the two mutations shared among all resistant clones in the structure of EBOV GPDmuc (5JQ3).
(C) Loss of binding of CA45 to the resistant clones determined by ELISA.
(D) Loss of CA45 neutralizing activity toward the resistant clones.
(E) Individual mutations in the escape sites do not affect CA45 binding indicating that combined mutation is needed for escape.
(F) Neutralization of CA45 escape mutants by FVM04.
