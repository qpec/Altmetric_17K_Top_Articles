SUMMARY
The human cerebral cortex possesses distinct struc-
tural and functional features that are not found in the
lower species traditionally used to model brain
development and disease. Accordingly, consider-
able attention has been placed on the development
of methods to direct pluripotent stem cells to form
human brain-like structures termed organoids. How-
ever, many organoid differentiation protocols are
inefficient and display marked variability in their abil-
ity to recapitulate the three-dimensional architecture
and course of neurogenesis in the developing human
brain. Here, we describe optimized organoid culture
methods that efficiently and reliably produce cortical
and basal ganglia structures similar to those in the
human fetal brain in vivo. Neurons within the organo-
ids are functional and exhibit network-like activities.
We further demonstrate the utility of this organoid
system for modeling the teratogenic effects of Zika
virus on the developing brain and identifying more
susceptibility receptors and therapeutic compounds
that can mitigate its destructive actions.
INTRODUCTION
The neocortex is a highly conserved region of the CNS that en-
ables complex sensory activities and higher cognitive functions.
It is disproportionately enlarged in humans and other primates
(Rakic, 2009), yet the mechanisms underlying its expansion
remain poorly defined. The developing neocortex is organized
into distinct inner proliferative progenitor compartments, the
ventricular zone (VZ) and the subventricular zone (SVZ), which
give rise to outer neuronal layers in the cortical plate (CP). The
VZ and SVZ contain various types of neural progenitors: apical
radial glial (aRG) cells in the VZ and basal radial glial (bRG) cells,
intermediate progenitors (IPs), and transit amplifying cells in the
SVZ. A key contributor to human neocortical growth is an expan-
sion of SVZ progenitors, and defects in this process are thought
to underlie a range of neurological disorders (Florio and Huttner,
2014; Sun and Hevner, 2014). The study of early human brain
development is challenging due to ethical and practical consid-
erations. Consequently, attention has been placed on the gener-
ation of in vitro models using human embryonic stem cells
(hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs)
(collectively hPSCs).
hPSCs have ability to self-renew and differentiate into multiple
cell types, and they can self-organize to form three-dimensional
(3D) structures with features of tissues in vivo. Initially, CNS

 development was modeled using adherent radial columnar neu-
roepithelial cells, termed neural rosettes, derived from mouse
embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and hESCs (Ying et al., 2003; Zhang
et al., 2001). It was later found that pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-
derived cerebral neuroepithelial cells sequentially generate
different classes of neurons, consistent with corticogenesis
in vivo, and exhibit multi-layered organization under certain
floating aggregate culture conditions (Eiraku et al., 2008; Gas-
pard et al., 2008). Several protocols for cerebral organotypic cul-
tures derived from hPSCs, often referred to as organoids, have
been established, with improvements in neuronal organization
and generation of basal progenitors (Kadoshima et al., 2013;
Lancaster et al., 2013; Pas
xca et al., 2015). Organoid techniques
have thus opened the door for studies of human-specific devel-
opmental features and disease modeling (Bershteyn et al., 2017;
Lancaster et al., 2013; Mariani et al., 2015; Qian et al., 2016).
Although cerebral organoid technology is promising, many
challenges remain, including rampant batch-to-batch and line-
to-line variability and irreproducibility; irregularities in the timing
of neuronal maturation, laminar architecture, and cell diversifica-
tion; unwanted differentiation into other tissue types; and a
paucity of direct comparisons of the organoids to native human
tissue. Consequently, there is no standardization of the methods
used to create cerebral organoids. To realize the potential of or-
ganoid systems, it is essential to establish robust and reproduc-
ible methods for neural differentiation into specific brain regions
to enrich for cells of interest while excluding unwanted cells that
confound downstream molecular analyses and applications
such as high-throughput phenotypic and therapeutic screening.
Here, we established a simple, yet efficient and reproducible,
cerebral organoid differentiation method in which 80%–90% of
structures expressed forebrain markers and displayed charac-
teristic neuroepithelial organization. Unbiased transcriptomic
analyses confirmed that these cerebral organoids closely match
fetal brain and developmental transitions in vivo up to the second
trimester. We further found that augmented stimulation of the
STAT3 pathway increased the production of basal progenitors,
improved the formation and separation of neuronal layers, and
promoted astrogliogenesis. Neurons in the cerebral organoids
exhibited action potentials and spontaneous ensemble activ-
ities. Finally, we used the organoid platform to model Zika virus
(ZIKV)-associated microcephaly, identifying additional suscepti-
bility receptors for ZIKV entry into neural progenitors and mole-
cules that can mitigate ZIKV-induced cytopathy. Collectively,
our studies provide the community with a reliable and experi-
mentally validated organoid culture system for investigating the
mechanistic details underlying human brain development and
disease.
RESULTS
Establishment of Efficient and Reproducible Methods
for Generating Cerebral Organoids
To initiate organoid formation, we first adapted methods
described by Kadoshima et al. (2013) to generate structures
from H9 hESCs (Figure S1A). Unlike Kadoshima et al. (2013),
we found that transforming growth factor b (TGF-b), bone
morphogenetic protein (BMP), or WNT inhibitors were not
required to facilitate neuronal fate commitment. To enable the
long-term survival and growth of the cerebral organoids, cultures
were maintained under hyperoxic (40% O2) without the use of
mechanical spinners employed in other protocols (Lancaster
et al., 2013; Qian et al., 2016). With these parameters, organoids
routinely exhibited good structural integrity for more than
150 days in culture.
After 2.5 weeks in vitro, nearly all aggregates expressed the
forebrain markers FOXG1 and LHX2 and general neural progen-
itor markers, such as N-CADHERIN (NCAD), PAX6, and NESTIN
(Figures 1A and 1B). Neuroepithelial layers formed on the periph-
ery of the structures with apical-out and basal-in polarity, and an
apoptotic region in the middle was demarcated by cleaved
CASP3 (clCASP3) staining (Figure 1A). At 2.5 weeks in vitro,
the average size of our cerebral organoids was �3.15 mm, 2–3
times bigger than those reported using other protocols (Bersh-
teyn et al., 2017; Qian et al., 2016), with marked consistency
across nine independent experiments (Figure 1C). Between 2.5
and 5 weeks in vitro, the neuroepithelial layers exhibited morpho-
genetic movements that reversed their apicobasal polarity, re-
sulting in uniform neural rosette-like structures within each
aggregate (Figure 1A). Similar differentiation results were
achieved with other hPSC lines (hESC, UCLA1; hiPSC, hIPS2,
and XFiPS) (Figures 1B and S1B and S1C). We also compared
the quality and reproducibility of cortical organoids formed
with our approach to those achieved using other reported
methods (Lancaster and Knoblich, 2014; Lancaster et al.,
2013). Our approach appeared more consistent in producing
cortical progenitors and yielded larger and better organized neu-
roepithelial rosettes (Figure S2).

 We further modified the methods described by Kadoshima
et al. (2013) by replacing fetal bovine serum (FBS) in the media
at 5 weeks in vitro onward with B27 supplement minus
vitamin A. This change increased the numbers of PAX6+ aRG
cells, TBR2+ IP cells, and CTIP2+ neurons, resulting in larger
organoids with enhanced laminar organization (Figures 1D and
1E, S1A, and S1D). TBR2+ IPs and PAX6+ phosphorylated
Vimentin (pVIM+) bRG cells were disproportionally expanded
compared to aRG cells (Figures S1D, S1G, S1I, and S1J), sug-
gesting that IP and bRG cells are preferentially generated under
the B27 media conditions.
Next, we assessed how well the organoids exhibit features of
human corticogenesis. At 1 week in vitro, the organoids showed
relatively uniform expression of neuroectodermal markers such
as SOX2, PAX6, and NCAD with no obvious apicobasal polarity,
similar to the profile of neuroepithelial cells in vivo at gestational
week 4 (Figures S1E and S1F). At 5 weeks in vitro, cells within the
organoid segregated into well-defined SOX2+ VZ progenitor and
TBR1+ preplate-like neuronal layers (Figures 1F and 1G). By
6.5 to 8 weeks in vitro, a prominent TBR2+ SVZ, thicker subplate,
CP regions, and REELIN+ marginal zone formed, and each
compartment continued to expand over time (Figures 1F, 1G
and S1H). The markers expressed by in vitro week 8 and older
organoids were similarly expressed within the gestational week
14 human fetal cortex (Figures 1H and 1I), indicating that our or-
ganoid system efficiently recapitulates the histological organiza-
tion and patterned expression of key developmental regulators
within the human fetal cortex in vivo.
Generation of Ventral Telencephalic Organoids
We examined whether our methods could be modified through
the addition of morphogen signals to systematically generate
different brain regions. To mimic theventralizingactivitiesof Sonic
hedgehog, which is essential for the formation of the basal gangli-
onic eminences (GEs), we pulsed organoids with Smoothened
agonist (SAG) at 15–21 days in vitro (Figure S3A). Lateral gangli-
onic eminence (LGE), medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), and
caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE) progenitor markers were upre-
gulated in a SAG dose-dependent manner. Exposure to high
amounts of SAG (1 mM) led to the expression of the MGE/CGE
marker NKX2.1 in �50% of cells at 5 weeks in vitro (Figures
S3B–S3E), followed by broad expression of the g-aminobutyric
acid (GABAergic) interneuron marker GAD65 in the neuronal
layers of in vitro week 8 organoids (Figures S3F and S3H). At
10 weeks in vitro, additional interneuron subtype markers such
as SOMATOSTATIN, CALRETININ, and NEUROPEPTIDE Y
were expressed, though PARVALBUMIN was undetectable (Fig-
ures S3F and S3G). By 14 weeks in vitro, the neurotransmitter
GABA was present in many cells (Figure S3F). Altogether, these
results demonstrate that basal GE-like structures and inhibitory
interneurons can be readily generated through the addition of
ventral patterning signals to our organoid platform.
Transcriptomic Analyses Confirm that Cerebral
Organoids Mimic Many Features of Cortical
Development In Vivo
We next used unbiased bioinformatics analyses (Stein et al.,
2014) to examine how closely our cerebral organoids recapitu-
late human fetal cortex gene expression. In this framework, three
core transcriptomic analyses were used: (1) CoNTExT, a ma-
chine-learning classifier, to identify the developmental maturity
and neuroanatomical identity of individual in vitro samples
compared to in vivo specimens; (2) transition mapping (TMAP)
differential expression analysis to identify which in vitro time
points best match in vivo developmental transitions; and (3)
weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) to iden-
tify preserved neurodevelopmental processes.
Hierarchical clustering using the top 5,000 most variable
genes showed that replicate samples of organoids primarily
grouped by developmental stage rather than across time points
(Figure 2A). CoNTExT confirmed their neuroanatomical identity
was cortex (Figure 2B), consistent with our immunohistochem-
ical analyses (Figure 1). CoNTExT also indicated that in vitro
week 5 organoids closely match the early embryonic stage of hu-
man brain development (period 1, 6–10 gestational weeks),
whereas in vitro week 14 organoids match early mid-fetal stages
in the second trimester (period 5, 18–21 gestational weeks)
(Figure 2C).
TMAP was then used to assess how developmental transi-
tions of the organoids matched in vivo. Differential gene
expression analyses between pairs of in vivo and in vitro stages
were performed, followed by ranking of the resulting gene lists
by p value and calculation of the significance of the overlap be-
tween the gene lists using a hypergeometric test (Figure 2D).
We observed strong concordance between in vitro week 5
versus in vitro week 14 organoids and the transition from em-
bryonic to early mid-fetal cortical developmental periods in vivo
(periods 1 to 3–4) (max � log10 (p value) = 545) (Figure 2D),
consistent with the CoNTExT prediction (Figure 2C). We also
applied TMAP to compare organoid maturation to the transi-
tions between distinct human fetal cortical laminae in vivo (Fig-
ure 2E), which reflect the differentiation of cortical progenitors
into neurons and other cell types. The transition from in vitro
week 5 to in vitro week 14 organoids closely matched the tran-
sition from the VZ or SVZ to the subplate or CP (Figure 2E).
Collectively, these data demonstrate remarkable preservation
of gene expression programs between the organoids and the
human fetal cortex.
Finally, to determine which specific cellular or biochemical
processes are most highly replicated in organoids compared
to fetal cortices in vivo, we used WGCNA (Langfelder and Hor-
vath, 2008). WGCNA identified groups of coexpressed genes
in prenatal human cortex (periods 1–8) coupled to module pres-
ervation analysis (Langfelder et al., 2011), as implemented in the
CoNTExT framework (Stein et al., 2014). Of the 28 modules
defined within the human fetal cortex, at least 14 were conserved
in cerebral organoids (preservation Z score R 4) (Figure 2F;
Table S1), including modules related to neural progenitor
mitosis, neurogenesis, and gliogenesis (modules 4, 3, 5, and
15); axon guidance, synaptogenesis, and synaptic transmission
(modules 2, 8, 11, 14, 20, and 27); and RNA processing, DNA
repair, and ubiquitin proteolysis (modules 3, 6, and 15). By
contrast, modules associated with blood vessel development
(module 19) and neuron-microglia interactions (module 10)
were not preserved, consistent with the absence of many non-
neural cell populations within the organoids.

contribute to bRG generation in the hu-
man cortex (Pollen et al., 2015). bRG cells
in the organoids, defined by character-
istic markers including SOX2, PAX6,
HOPX, ITGb5, and pVIM; the absence of
TBR2; and somatic location within the
SVZ, were readily found from 8 weeks
in vitro onward (Figures 1F–1H, 3A–3D,
S1I, S1J, and S4A). However, activating
phosphorylation (p) of STAT3 was not
apparent (Figure S4A). The addition of re-
combinant leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)
to in vitro week 5 organoids strongly
elevated pSTAT3 staining and led to
both a >3-fold increase in bRG cells and
thickening of the SVZ by 12 weeks
in vitro (Figures 3A–3D and S4A–S4C).
Because basal progenitor expansion in
the SVZ is implicated in the enlargement
of superficial neuronal layers in the hu-
man cortex (Rakic, 2009), we examined
the organization of the CP in cerebral or-
ganoids after LIF application. Irrespective of LIF inclusion,
CTIP2+
or
TRB1+
lower-layer
neurons
were
distributed
throughout the CP. However, with LIF addition, SATB2+ and
BRN2+ upper layers were enlarged and more clearly segregated
outward in the CP, similar to the distribution of neurons seen in
the gestational week 15.5 human fetal CP (Figures 3F, S4D,
Cell Reports 21, 517–532, October 10, 2017
521
 (legend on next page)

Cell Reports 21, 517–532, October 10, 2017
 and S4E). LIF application also improved the formation of a
LAMININ+ basement membrane at the outer margin of the orga-
noids (Figure 3F). The layered organization of neurons within the
organoids persisted up to 22 weeks in culture (the latest time
point evaluated), at which time a prominent outer layer of
CUX1+ neurons had formed, particularly in the LIF-treated cul-
tures (Figures 3G and 3H). Apoptotic cell death was low (Fig-
ure 3G), suggesting that these culture conditions are conducive
to long-term neuronal survival. Collectively, these results show
that LIF application can enhance the production of bRG and for-
mation of defined upper layers of neurons within the organoids.
LIF/STAT3 signaling has also been implicated in promoting as-
trogliogenesis in the rodent CNS (Fukuda et al., 2007; Naka-
shima et al., 1999). Without LIF, astrocytes distinguished by
GFAP and HepaCAM staining and characteristic star-shaped
morphologies were rare in the CP region of in vitro week 14 orga-
noids (Figure 3E). After LIF addition, GFAP+ astrocytes were
readily found, along with a smaller number of HepaCAM+ cells
(Figures 3E and S5A). We also observed a 30-fold upregulation
of GFAP mRNA and increased GFAP protein staining in aRG
soma and fibers, most likely reflecting their transition toward as-
trogliogenesis (Figures 3E and S5A). Regardless of LIF presence
or absence, we did not detect signs of oligodendrocyte forma-
tion (Figure S4F). Long-term culture of organoids has previously
been shown to result in glial overgrowth (Pas
xca et al., 2015; Ren-
ner et al., 2017), but we did not observe this to be the case in the
in vitro week 22 organoids. GFAP+ astrocytes constituted �8%
of the total cell population, less than that found in the human
neonatal brain (�40% GFAP+) (Figures S5B and S5C).
We lastly compared the astrocyte-promoting effects of LIF to
other growth factors known to stimulate the STAT3 pathway,
including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial
cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) (Ng et al., 2006).
BDNF and GDNF did not appear to alter the number of GFAP
cells, though we did detect a slight enhancement in HepaCAM
staining, albeit to a lesser extent than that seen with LIF (Fig-
ure S5D). However, the addition of all three factors led to marked
upregulation of HepaCAM (Figure S5D), suggesting that their ac-
tions can be combined to maximally enhance astrogliogenesis.
Neurons in Cerebral Organoids Are Functionally Similar
to Their Native Counterparts and Exhibit Spontaneous
Network Activities
To determine the physiological properties of cerebral organoid
neurons, we conducted patch clamp recordings within slice
preparations. Half of all recorded cells (n = 12 of 24) produced
tetrodotoxin-sensitive spike trains upon current stimulation (Fig-
ures 4A and 4D). The sodium and potassium currents were then
measured in response to current injections. Cells with action
potentials (APs) exhibited larger sodium and potassium peak
currents compared to those lacking action potentials (Figures
4B–4D). We also assessed the intrinsic properties of all neurons,
including membrane potential, membrane resistance, capaci-
tance, peak sodium current, and peak potassium current (Fig-
ure 4D; Table S4). The values recorded in the organoids were
strikingly similar to those previously obtained from slices of hu-
man fetal cortex from gestational weeks 16–22 (Moore et al.,
2009). Only peak amplitudes for sodium and potassium currents
were larger in organoids. Altogether, these data demonstrate
that neurons in cerebral organoids have electrophysiological
properties that closely match the profiles of neurons recorded
from mid-gestational stages of human fetal cortex, consistent
with our immunohistochemical, molecular, and bioinformatics
analyses.
Next, we examined whether neurons in the organoids exhibit
hallmarks of functional maturity and synaptic connectivity.
Many CTIP2+ neurons expressed Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent
protein kinase 2a (CaMK2a), a kinase associated with calcium
signaling and synaptic plasticity, and displayed high levels of
SYNAPSIN (SYN) promoter activity driving either Channelrho-
dopsin2-YFP or the genetically encoded calcium indicator
GCaMP6f (Figures 4E–4G0). Punctate staining for the synaptic
vesicle-associated transporter VGLUT1 was also found at
many axosomatic and axodendritic contacts between neurons
in 3D reconstructions (Figures 4G and 4G0). mRNA expression
of additional synaptic markers, including SV2A, SYNAPSIN1,
and SYNAPTOTAGMIN1, were confirmed by microarray ana-
lyses (Figure S6A).
To test whether cortical neurons in organoids display network
functions, structures were infected with SYN::GCaMP6f adeno-
associated viruses, and calcium dynamics were imaged with
resonant scanning two-photon microscopy (Figures 4H and
S6B) (Golshani et al., 2009). Many neurons exhibited sponta-
neous calcium transients typical for AP spiking (Figure 4H; Movie
S1). Firing rates extracted from such events revealed signifi-
cantly correlated deconvolved calcium transients in �18% of
all neuronal pairs measured (16 pairs out of 14 segmented cells),
suggesting partial synchronization (Figures 4I, 4J, and S6C).
Thus, neurons in the cortical organoids appear to exhibit sponta-
neous ensemble activities.

ZIKV envelope (E) protein was readily
detected in many cortical cells 3 days
postinfection (3 dpi) of organoids with a
Puerto
Rican
ZIKV
isolate
(PRVABC
59),
mostly
in
the
VZ
and
SVZ
regions (Figures 5A and S7F). Of the
infected cells, 74% were SOX2+ aRG
and
bRG
progenitors,
20%
were
TBR2+ IPs, and 7% were CTIP2+ neu-
rons (Figures 5A and 5D). With respect
to each cell type, 75% of the SOX2+
and TBR2+ cells were infected com-
pared to 14% of CTIP2+ neurons (Fig-
ure 5D), indicating that ZIKV preferen-
tially infects progenitors.
Previous work has suggested that the susceptibility of neural
progenitors to ZIKV infection may be due their expression of
the AXL tyrosine kinase receptor, a known entry portal for flavivi-
ruses (Nowakowski et al., 2016). However, more recent studies
have found that AXL deletion does not protect these cells from
infection (Wells et al., 2016), suggesting the existence of addi-
tional entry receptors. Studies in both skin and placental cells
524
Cell Reports 21, 517–532, October 10, 2017
 have implicated the AXL-related receptor tyrosine kinases
TYRO3 and MER (collectively termed TAM receptors), T cell
immunoglobulin and mucin domain (TIM) family receptors, and
CD209 as potential candidates (Hamel et al., 2015; Tabata
et al., 2016). In in vitro week 8 cerebral organoids, AXL,
TYRO3, MER, and TIM1 were all prominently localized along
the apical surface of aRG cells, with additional punctate staining

for TYRO3 and MER seen in both the VZ
and the SVZ (Figures 5A and 5C). The
expression of CD209 was undetectable.
We confirmed similar distribution of these
receptors in the gestational week 15.5 hu-
man fetal cortex (Figures S7B and S7C).
Thus, the susceptibility of cortical progen-
itors to ZIKV is plausibly explained by their
prominent expression of at least 4 entry
receptors.
We also observed highly infected vesic-
ular structures in the cerebral organoids
that were SOX2 and PAX6 negative yet
positive for AXL and the choroid plexus
epithelial cell marker AQP1 (Figures 5B
and S7A). These findings suggest a po-
tential route of ZIKV entry into the CNS
from the bloodstream in vivo, given that
the highly vascularized choroid plexus secretes cerebrospinal
fluid that flows around aRG progenitors, thus exposing them to
the virus.
Next, we analyzed the teratogenic effects of ZIKV infection. Af-
ter 14 dpi, in vitro week 3 cerebral organoids were stained for
HOECHST and propidium iodide (PI) to detect cell death. In
mock infected organoids, limited cell death was detected in
Cell Reports 21, 517–532, October 10, 2017
525
 the necrotic core of the structures (Figure 5E). ZIKV exposure
dramatically increased the intensity and extent of PI staining
and reduced the overall size, area, and perimeter of the organo-
ids (Figures 5E and 5F). After 14 dpi, 98% of SOX2+ aRG and
bRG progenitors, 77% of TBR2+ IPs, and 63% of CTIP2+ neu-
rons were infected with ZIKV (Figures 5G and 5H). Apoptotic
death was widespread and catastrophic, with 69% of the cells
positive for clCASP3 (Figure 5H). The incidence of cell death
was similar within each cell type: 76% SOX2+ progenitors,
72% TBR2+ progenitors, and 69% CTIP2+ neurons.
ZIKV infection can also induce spinal cord injury and enceph-
alitis in newborn mice (Fernandes et al., 2017) and has been de-
tected in postmortem human fetal spinal cords (Mlakar et al.,
2016). We accordingly tested whether ZIKV could also infect spi-
nal motor neuron progenitors derived from H9 hESCs using pre-
viously described methods (Adams et al., 2015). After ZIKV
exposure, �80% of cells became infected, followed by wide-
spread apoptotic cell death particularly in OLIG2+ motor neuron
progenitors (Figure S7D). LHX2+ cortical progenitors dissociated
from cerebral organoids were similarly infected and killed by
ZIKV (Figure S7E). These data show that ZIKV has the capacity
to broadly infect and destroy neural progenitors throughout the
CNS.
ZIKV Infection Activates Innate Immune Responses
Leading to Programmed Cell Death
To better understand how ZIKV affects neural progenitors, we
examined the transcriptional changes that precede and coincide
with the onset of cell death within infected in vitro week 8 cortical
organoids using RNA sequencing (Figure S8). At 3 dpi, ZIKV en-
velope protein was present by immunostaining, but cell death
was not seen until 5–7 dpi (Figures 6A and 6B). Gene ontology
(GO) analyses showed that genes associated with innate immune
responses, such as interferon-a, interferon-b, ISG15-protein
conjugation, and regulation of viral entry, were all highly upregu-
lated at 3 dpi (Figure 6C; Table S2). However, genes associated
with neural development, differentiation, and morphogenesis
were suppressed (Figure 6C; Tables S2 and S3), consistent
with the decreased expression of neural markers and reductions
in organoid size seen after ZIKV exposure (Figure 5). By 5 dpi,
genes associated with the unfolded protein response and
apoptotic signaling pathways became highly upregulated, while
genes associated with DNA replication, cell-cycle progression,
and mitosis were downregulated (Figure 6C; Tables S2 and S3).
Among the 50 genes most upregulated at 3 and 5 dpi, �28%
were implicated with immune system activation and function,
including several chemokines and cytokines (Table S2). These
data support the view that ZIKV can directly and indirectly trigger
inflammatory responses, leading to neurodegeneration.
Identification of Drugs that Mitigate the Teratogenic
Effects of ZIKV Infection on Cortical Development
Although most genes activated by ZIKV infection are known to
activate inflammation, �32% of the induced genes were associ-
ated with antiviral activities (Table S2). Of note was cholesterol
25-hydroxylase (CH25H), which encodes an enzyme capable
of broadly protecting cells from viral infection (Liu et al., 2013).
CH25H converts cholesterol to 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC),
a soluble factor that blocks viral entry by inhibiting membrane
fusion (Liu et al., 2013). The therapeutic potential for 25HC has
been further demonstrated through our recent studies showing
that administration to adult non-human primates and mice can
reduce viremia and block ZIKV-induced fetal microcephaly
when administered during pregnancy (Li et al., 2017). Because
25HC is a natural defense protein against several viruses, we
tested whether this mechanism could be augmented to alleviate
ZIKV-induced cytopathy. Addition of 2.5 mM 25HC to the orga-
noid cultures reduced ZIKV mRNA within the organoids by
�74% and the overall number of ZIKV envelope-positive cells
by �72% (Figures 7A, S9A, and S9A0; Table S5). However, there
was no appreciable rescue of cell death, most likely reflecting
mild toxicity seen with sustained exposure of the organoids to
25HC alone (Figure 7A).
Next, we tested whether ZIKV entry and associated pathology
could be ameliorated by agents targeting the AXL receptor pre-
sent on neural progenitors. Organoids were pretreated with either
R428, a small molecule inhibitor of the AXL tyrosine kinase
domain(Tabata et al.,2016),or anti-AXL antibodies,both of which
have previously been shown to block ZIKV entry and/or spread in
some cell types (Hamel et al., 2015; Meertens et al., 2017; Retal-
lack et al., 2016). High levels of R428 had modest effects,
reducing ZIKV mRNA levels by �41% and clCASP3 staining to
a similar extent, though changes in ZIKV envelope staining were
not statistically significant (Figure 7B; Table S5). Anti-AXL anti-
body treatment was less effective, showing no significant reduc-
tion in ZIKV mRNA levels (Figures S9B and S9B0; Table S5). These
resultsarelikelyexplainedby thepresence ofadditionalviralentry
receptors that we have found are highly expressed by neural pro-
genitors in both organoids and fetal cortex in vivo.
Several studies have reported protective effects of distinct
classes of antibiotics in combating flaviviral infection. We tested
three candidates, duramycin, ivermectin, and azithromycin. Du-
ramycin is a cyclic peptide approved for veterinary use that is
capable of binding to phosphatidylethanolamine residues pre-
sent in flavivirus virion lipid membrane and thereby blocking their
interactions with phosphatidylserine receptors present on target
cells, including AXL, TYRO3, MER, and TIM1. Duramycin has
shown efficacy in blocking Ebola, Dengue, and West Nile infec-
tion in cultured Vero cells (Richard et al., 2015) and ZIKV infection
of human placental cells (Tabata et al., 2016). Ivermectin and azi-
thromycin are U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-
approved lipophilic macrolide antibiotics that modulate microbi-
al peptidyltransferases and protein translation. Ivermectin can
also bind and inhibit flavivirus helicases needed for viral replica-
tion and block replication of yellow fever, West Nile, Dengue,
Japanese encephalitis, and ZIKVs in a range of cell lines (Bar-
rows et al., 2016; Mastrangelo et al., 2012). Azithromycin ap-
pears capable of reducing ZIKV infection of cultured glial cells
(Retallack et al., 2016). Administration of either duramycin or
ivermectin to the cortical organoids dramatically reduced ZIKV
mRNA (76% and 96%, respectively) and both ZIKV envelope
staining (98% and 97% decrease) and clCASP3 staining (81%
and 47% decrease) (Figures 7C, 7D, S9D, and S9D0; Table S5).
Although ivermectin was highly protective against ZIKV infection,
its addition alone led to a small increase in cell death that was not
seen with duramycin (Figures 7C and 7D; Table S5). By contrast,
526
Cell Reports 21, 517–532, October 10, 2017
 azithromycin displayed no significant capacity to reduce ZIKV
expression by qRT-PCR or immunostaining (Figures S9C and
S9C0; Table S5). Altogether, these data demonstrate the utility
of the cortical organoid system for discriminating among drugs
that could mitigate the teratogenic effects of ZIKV infection in
the developing human nervous system and identify duramycin
and ivermectin as promising leads for further study.
DISCUSSION
Successes and Remaining Challenges in Modeling
Human Brain Development In Vitro
The ability of hPSCs to form 3D brain-like structures allows for
the investigation of mechanisms underlying human brain devel-
opment and disease, but as an emergent technology, technical
challenges remain. Here, we established a simple yet efficient
and reproducible cerebral organoid differentiation method that
is applicable across hPSC lines, and we provide side-by-side
comparisons to human fetal cortex using immunohistochemical,
transcriptomic, and electrophysiological analyses. We further
demonstrate the utility of our organoid platform for modeling
the basic mechanisms underlying human corticogenesis and
disease.
Thus far, two general approaches have been employed to
make organoids: directed differentiation into particular brain re-
gions using defined culture media (Kadoshima et al., 2013;
Pas
xca et al., 2015; Qian et al., 2016) or whole-brain differentiation
methods that permit the spontaneous formation of multiple

 neural populations (Lancaster et al., 2013). While the latter
approach offers the potential to create brain-like structures
with more component parts, it comes at the expense of struc-
tural consistency, with higher variability among individual orga-
noids and experiments that can confound disease modeling ef-
forts (Quadrato et al., 2016). Because no extrinsic factors were
used in our differentiation, the nascent neural tissues exhibit a
great deal of plasticity, evident by the robust formation of ventral
telencephalic structures (MGE or CGE) in response to Sonic
Hedgehog (SHH) pathway agonists. GE organoids offer a means
to investigate the mechanisms of interneuron differentiation,
migration, and circuit formation.
Because our organoid methods do not require special appa-
ratus such as spinning bioreactors, the platform is easily scaled
up or down. After aggregates are formed in V-shaped 96-well
plates, they can be transferred en masse to bacterial dishes or
multi-well plates for testing different media conditions or thera-
peutic compounds. The stationary nature of our system reduces
mechanical damage to the organoids, often seen with growth in
spinning bioreactors. In the future, further improvement in large-
scale production may be achieved by adopting polymer-based
3D sphere culture methods (Otsuji et al., 2014).
Expansion of bRG Formation and Promotion of
Astrogliogenesis through STAT3 Activation
The human cerebral cortex differs from that of lower species,
such as rodents, with respect to the expansion of bRG cells
and size of the outer SVZ compartment (Florio and Huttner,
2014; Sun and Hevner, 2014). Because bRG are sparse in ro-
dents, human cortical organoids are an ideal model system for
investigating the expansion of bRG. Nevertheless, bRG produc-
tion is modest in many organoid protocols compared to the fetal
cortex, suggesting that in vitro culture conditions may not permit
the optimal expansion of these cells.
Analyses of the human fetal cortex have suggested that acti-
vation of the LIFR/STAT3 pathway may be a characteristic
feature of bRG cell maintenance in vivo (Pollen et al., 2015).
While expression of LIFR and other bRG markers is preserved
in organoids, we found little evidence of STAT3 activation. LIF
addition markedly expanded the number of bRG cells and the
size of the SVZ, enhanced the separation of neurons into deep
and superficial layers, established a basal lamina, and preserved
organoid structure and neuronal survival to 22 weeks in vitro. LIF
also increased the production of astrocytes, consistent with pre-
vious reports (Fukuda et al., 2007; Nakashima et al., 1999).
Although LIFR/STAT3 signaling is not required for bRG cell for-
mation, it appears rate limiting for bRG expansion. The lack of
LIF production within the cortical organoids suggests that its or-
igins are other cells that are missing in vitro. Rodent studies have
shown that LIF may be maternally supplied and transported to
fetal brain tissues through both the vasculature and the cerebro-
spinal fluid (Simamura et al., 2010) and produced locally by the
developing choroid plexus (Gregg and Weiss, 2005). Brain endo-
thelial cells secrete LIF and can stimulate astrogliogenesis in cul-
ture (Mi et al., 2001), raising the possibility that they could serve a
similar function in vivo. Most bRG and IPs reside near blood ves-
sels in the SVZ (Hansen et al., 2010; Stubbs et al., 2009), sug-
gesting an intimate relationship. Altogether, these findings illus-
trate both the importance of the interactions of the vasculature
and other cell populations within the developing cortex and the
need for fetal tissue research to help discover and explore these
connections.
ZIKV-Mediated Activation of Innate Immune Responses
The recent worldwide outbreak of ZIKV infection and CZS has
sparked efforts to understand how the virus causes fetal brain
damage and develop means to circumvent. ZIKV can directly
infect neural progenitors and disrupt neural development, lead-
ing to reduced organoid growth and overall size, thus recapitu-
lating microcephaly seen in fetuses and infants exposed to the
virus. We also found that ZIKV infection and tissue damage
extend to other regions of the nervous system that we generated
from hPSCs, such as the spinal cord, again modeling some neu-
ral pathologies seen in patients.
Susceptibility of neural progenitors to infection has been
attributed to the expression of AXL (Nowakowski et al., 2016; Re-
tallack et al., 2016), but deletion of AXL from hPSCs shows that
neural progenitors are still susceptible to ZIKV infection in its
absence (Wells et al., 2016). Our studies implicate additional
members of the TAM/TIM family of transmembrane receptors,
TYRO3, MER, and TIM1, as likely entry portals, because their
expression was largely confined to VZ and SVZ progenitors,
along with AXL. Studies in mice further indicate that neither sin-
gle nor combined deletion of two of the three TAM receptors can
alleviate ZIKV infection (Hastings et al., 2017), suggesting that
expression of even a single receptor may render cells suscepti-
ble to the virus.
Insights into how ZIKV triggers cell death have emerged from
our and others analyses of transcriptional changes that occur in
neural cells after infection (Ghouzzi et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2016;
Zhang et al., 2016). Infected cerebral organoids downregulated
genes associated with DNA replication, metabolic processes,
and cell-cycle progression and upregulated DNA damage
response genes such as TP53 and those associated with
apoptotic cell death. Aberrant activation of DNA-damage repair
pathways has been shown to impede neural progenitor expan-
sion and are the root cause of many genetic forms of human
microcephaly (Gilmore and Walsh, 2013; O’Driscoll and Jeggo,
2008). Thus, the severe reductions in brain size seen after ZIKV
exposure
likely
reflect

 progenitors and blockade in their proliferative and neurogenic
capacities.
One-third of the 50 most upregulated genes following ZIKV
infection were associated with interferon signaling and innate im-
mune response preceding the onset of cell death. The extent of
these responses may be a primary determinant of neural pathol-
ogy. Studies comparing neural progenitor death in vitro following
exposure to either an African strain of ZIKV, which had not pre-
viously been associated with neural damage, or a more recently
isolated Asian strain of ZIKV, associated with microcephaly,
found that the latter elicited a stronger interferon response and
TP53 activation, potentially explaining strain-specific pathol-
ogies (Zhang et al., 2016). Elevated interferon levels during fetal
and postnatal development are also implicated in neuropsychi-
atric diseases, including schizophrenia, autism, mental retarda-
tion, and Down syndrome (Patterson, 2009; Sullivan et al.,
2016). Therefore, even though infants exposed to ZIKV might
escape structural brain defects, their risk for neurodevelopmen-
tal and neuropsychiatric disorders may be significantly elevated.
Future studies may provide valuable insights into how aberrant
neuroimmune activation affects the developing brain beyond
microcephaly.
Cerebral Organoids as Models for Anti-ZIKV Therapies
There are no approved therapies or vaccines to combat ZIKV
infection and its destructive effect on the developing fetal brain.
Neural organoids thus provide an invaluable resource to facilitate
drugdiscovery.Oneof thefirstdrugsidentified asa potential ZIKV
treatment, azithromycin, can significantly reduce ZIKV infection
ofculturedgliomacells(Retallacket al.,2016)yetshowed littleac-
tivity in our organoid platform, suggesting that its protective ef-
fects on the fetal brain may be limited. By contrast, ivermectin
and duramycin both displayed marked efficacy in reducing
ZIKV infection and neural tissue loss. The potency of duramycin
may reflect its ability to block multiple viral envelope-phosphati-
dylserine receptor interactions, particularly those involving TIM1
(Richard et al., 2015), which we found is prominently expressed
by early neural progenitors in vivo, along with TAM family mem-
bers, and faithfully recapitulated in cortical organoids. Although
the predictive value of the organoid system requires further vali-
dation, our studies demonstrate its power in singling out thera-
peutic candidates meriting future investigations.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
PSC Culture and Organoid Differentiation
hPSC experiments were conducted with prior approval from the University of
California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Embryonic Stem Cell Research Oversight
(ESCRO) Committee. hPSC lines H9, UCLA1, hIPS2, and XFiPS were obtained
from the UCLA Broad Stem Cell Research Center Core and maintained on
0.1% gelatin-coated plates with irradiated mouse embryonic feeders in
DMEM/F12 (HyClone) with 20% knockout serum replacement (KSR, Invitro-
gen), modified Eagle’s medium (MEM) non-essential amino acids (NEAAs, In-
vitrogen), GlutaMAX (Invitrogen), 0.1 mM b-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen),
100 mg/mL of Primocin (InvivoGen), and 10 ng/mL of fibroblast growth factor
2 (FGF2, Invitrogen). hPSCs were maintained at 5% CO2 at 37�C with daily me-
dia change and were passaged every 6 days at 1:3–1:6 using StemPro EZ Pas-
sage tool (Invitrogen). Experiments were performed on cells between pas-
sages 40–80 for H9, UCLA1, and hIPS2 and between passages 10–20 for
XFiPS.
Cortical organoid differentiation was performed as described (Kadoshima
et al., 2013) with several modifications. Briefly, hPSCs were dissociated to sin-
gle cells and plated into low-attachment V-bottom 96-well plates (Sumitomo
Bakelite, MS-9096V) to form aggregates in Glasgow’s Minimal Essential Me-
dium (GMEM) (Invitrogen), 20% KSR, NEAA, 100 mg/mL of Primocin, 0.1 mM
b-mercaptoethanol, sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), and 20 mM ROCK inhibitor
(BioPioneer) without Wnt and TGF-b inhibitors. Half of the media was changed
every 2–3 days. ROCK inhibitor was removed after 6 days. Aggregates were
then transferred to a hyperoxygenated incubator at 5% CO2 and 40% O2
and maintained in DMEM/F12 with N2 (Invitrogen), GlutaMAX, chemically
defined lipid concentrate (CDLC, Invitrogen), and 0.4% methylcellulose
(Sigma). Culture media was changed every 2–3 days thereafter. On day 35, or-
ganoids were cut in half using Vannas spring scissors (Fine Science Tools) and
media was changed to N2B27 media containing DMEM/F12 supplemented
with N2, GlutaMAX, CDLC, 0.4% methylcellulose, B27 without vitamin A (Invi-
trogen), 1% growth factor-reduced Matrigel (Fisher Scientific, CB-40230), and
5 mg/mL of heparin (Sigma). For the FBS method, 10% FBS (Invitrogen) was
used in place of B27 without vitamin A. On day 56, organoids were cut in
half and transferred to oxygen permeable dishes (Lumox, Sarstedt) containing
N2B27 media. Organoids were subsequently cut in half every 2 weeks and
routinely sustained for up to 150 days. For STAT3 activation, LIF (Millipore)
was added at 2,000 U/mL from day 35 onward. At the end of the experiments,
organoids were processed for immunohistochemical and RNA analyses as
described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. See Table S6 for
key resources and Table S7 for antibody information.
ZIKV Infection
ZIKV strain PRVABC59 was obtained from the United States Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention (CDC) and further amplified in Aedes albopictus
C6/36 cells. Briefly, C6/36 cells were infected at a MOI of 0.05 for 10 days.
Cell culture supernatant was collected, centrifuged at 8,000 3 g for 10 min
at 4�C, and frozen in aliquots at �80�C. Supernatants from uninfected C3/36
cells were collected as control media for mock infection. Viral titer was deter-
mined to be about 107 PFU/mL by standard plaque assay on Vero cells.
For infection, each organoid (�80,000 cells per in vitro week 3 organoid and
�150,000 cells per in vitro week 8 organoid) was inoculated with 1:2–1:8 viral
stocks diluted in N2-based media (MOI of �0.3 to 3.125) (Figure S7F) as pre-
viously described (Li et al., 2017) and incubated for 2 hr. Thereafter, viral stocks
were further diluted 1:2 with fresh culture media. Organoids were maintained
with the diluted virus for 24 hr, and then media containing ZIKV was removed
and replaced with fresh culture media. Media was then changed every
2–3 days for the remainder of the experiment. Organoids were collected and
analyzed by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry at various time points. De-
tails for the administration of anti-ZIKV drugs are described in the Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures.
