Abstract
GPR139 is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is expressed mainly in the brain, with the highest
expression in the medial habenula. The modulation of GPR139 receptor function has been hypothesized to be
beneficial in the treatment of some mental disorders, but behavioral studies have not yet provided causal evidence of
the role of GPR139 in brain dysfunction. Because of the high expression of GPR139 in the habenula, a critical brain
region in addiction, we hypothesized that GPR139 may play role in alcohol dependence. Thus, we tested the effect of
GPR139 receptor activation using the selective, brain-penetrant receptor agonist JNJ-63533054 on addiction-like
behaviors in alcohol-dependent male rats. Systemic administration of JNJ-63533054 (30 mg/kg but not 10 mg/kg, p.o.)
reversed the escalation of alcohol self-administration in alcohol-dependent rats, without affecting water or saccharin
intake in dependent rats or alcohol intake in nondependent rats. Moreover, systemic JNJ-63533054 administration
decreased withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia, without affecting somatic signs of alcohol withdrawal. Further analysis
demonstrated that JNJ-63533054 was effective only in a subgroup of dependent rats that exhibited compulsive-like
alcohol drinking. Finally, site-specific microinjection of JNJ-63533054 in the habenula but not interpeduncular nucleus
(IPN) reduced both alcohol self-administration and withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia in dependent rats. These results
provide robust preclinical evidence that GPR139 receptor activation reverses key addiction-like behaviors in depen-
dent animals, suggest that GPR139 may be a novel target for the treatment of alcohol use disorder, and demonstrate
that GPR139 is functionally relevant in regulating mammalian behavior.

Significance Statement
GPR139 has been identified as a receptor with high expression in a key brain region for addiction, the habenula.
However, no studies have yet provided causal evidence of the role of GPR139 in brain dysfunction. This study found
that GPR139 receptor activation reduced alcohol self-administration in alcohol-dependent rats with compulsive-like
drinking and decreased withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia. Importantly, we found that the habenula but not interpe-
duncular nucleus (IPN) was a mediator of the observed effects. These results represent an important advance in the
field because they are the first to demonstrate a role for GPR139 in addiction-related behaviors.

 Introduction
Alcohol use disorder is a chronic relapsing disorder that
is characterized by repeated cycles of excessive alcohol
use and withdrawal. Major issues in the alcohol field
include the limited number of medications that are avail-
able for the treatment of alcohol dependence and the lack
of novel druggable targets beyond those that are associ-
ated with classic neurotransmitter systems (Volkow and
Li, 2005). Currently, three medications have received
United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ap-
proval for alcohol dependence (disulfiram, naltrexone,
and acamprosate), but these drugs are associated with
low compliance, modest effect sizes, and a return to
excessive drinking when treatment is discontinued (Pe-
terson, 2007; Garbutt, 2009; Olive, 2010). Therefore, it is
critical to develop novel pharmacotherapies with larger
effect sizes and fewer side effects to improve the treat-
ment of alcohol use disorder.
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) play an important
role in mental disorders. A large proportion (30–60%) of
current pharmaceutical drugs exert their therapeutic ef-
fects by targeting GPCRs (McCusker et al., 2007; Heng
et al., 2013). Considering the prevalence and functional
importance of GPCRs, unsurprising is that they remain
among the most investigated targets for pharmaceutical
discovery, especially because the current GPCR-tar-
geting drugs affect only a small proportion of known
GPCRs.
Orphan GPCRs are receptors for which endogenous
ligands have not yet been fully identified. Most known
GPCRs start as orphan GPCRs, and discoveries in the
field have had a profound impact on our understanding of
brain function (Civelli, 2012). Orphan GPCRs represent
compelling novel targets in drug discovery. One such
orphan GPCR, GPR139 (also known as GPRg1 or
GPCR12), was first identified as a rhodopsin family GPCR
that is almost exclusively expressed in the central nervous
system (Gloriam et al., 2005; Matsuo et al., 2005).
GPR139 receptors were also found to be highly con-
served across species (Gloriam et al., 2005). The remark-
ably high sequence homology across different species
and predominant brain expression suggest that GPR139
may play a critical role in brain function. Modulators of
GPR139 receptor function may thus be particularly inter-
esting for drug development for the treatment of mental
disorders.
Interestingly, the highest expression of GPR139 recep-
tors has been reported in the habenula (Matsuo et al.,
2005; Wang et al., 2015; Hitchock et al., 2016), a brain
region that has been shown to be critically involved in
addiction, anxiety, and mood regulation (Fowler and
Kenny, 2012; Batalla et al., 2017). A comparison of rodent
and human transcriptome data recently identified a spe-
cific GPR139-including cluster of highly expressed habe-
nular genes that are common to humans and rodents
(Boulos et al., 2017). Interestingly, this cluster also ex-
presses the � opioid receptor, among others. In the me-
dial habenula, GPR139-positive neurons project axons via
the fasciculus retroflexus to the interpeduncular nucleus
(IPN), where low GPR139 immunoreactivity is also de-
tected (Liu et al., 2015). Both the habenula (Matsumoto
and Hikosaka, 2007; Fowler et al., 2011; Hsu et al., 2014;
Ishikawa and Kenny, 2016; Laurent et al., 2017) and IPN
(Taraschenko et al., 2007; Antolin-Fontes et al., 2015;
McLaughlin et al., 2017) have been identified as key re-
gions in addiction.
Given the high expression of GPR139 in the habenula, we
hypothesized that the modulation of GPR139 may be rele-
vant to alcohol addiction-related behaviors. To test this hy-
pothesis, we studied the effects of systemic administration
of a selective GPR139 receptor agonist, JNJ-63533054, on
alcohol self-administration in alcohol-nondependent and
-dependent rats using chronic intermittent exposure (CIE) to
alcohol vapor combined with operant self-administration.
Addiction-related behaviors were assessed by measuring
compulsive-like drinking despite adverse consequence (i.e.,
resistance to quinine adulteration), somatic signs of with-
drawal, and mechanical nociception during withdrawal
(i.e., withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia) in alcohol-depen-
dent rats. We selected the CIE model because it has been
shown to have predictive validity for alcohol use disorder
in humans (Macey et al., 1996; Heilig and Koob, 2007).
Finally, we tested the effects of intra-habenular and intra-
IPN microinjections of JNJ-63553054 on alcohol self-admini-
stration and alcohol withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia in
alcohol-dependent rats.
Materials and Methods
Subjects
Adult male Wistar rats (n � 46, Charles River), weighing
250–300 g at the beginning of the experiments, were
used. The rats were group-housed, two per cage, in a
temperature-controlled (22°C) animal facility on a 12/12 h
light/dark cycle (lights off at 10 A.M.). The rats had access
to food and water ad libitum. All animal procedures were
conducted in adherence to the National Institutes of
Health’s Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Ani-
mals and approved by The Scripps Research Institute
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. All behav-
ioral testing was conducted during the dark phase.
Drugs
A 10% (v/v) alcohol drinking solution was prepared by
diluting 95% alcohol with tap water. A 0.04% (w/v) sac-
charin drinking solution was prepared by diluting saccha-
rin with tap water. JNJ-63533054 was synthesized at

 Janssen Research & Development as described previ-
ously (Dvorak et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2015). For systemic
infusion, JNJ-63533054 was dissolved in 0.5% hydroxy-
propyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and administered orally 6
h into withdrawal, 60 min before behavioral testing, at
doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg (2 ml/kg). The rats were habit-
uated to the gastric gavage before starting the experi-
ments. For intra-habenular and intra-IPN administration,
JNJ-63533054 (0.25 �g/0.5 �l) was dissolved in vehicle
that was composed of 5% dimethylsulfoxide, 5% emul-
phor, and 90% distilled water and infused 15 min before
behavioral testing. For all of the self-administration stud-
ies, JNJ-63533054 was administered using a within-
subjects design, and the order of injections of vehicle and
JNJ-63533054 was counterbalanced. Quinine hydrochlo-
ride was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Increasing con-
centrations of quinine (0.005, 0.01, 0.025, and 0.05 g/l)
were used to adulterate the alcohol drinking solution.
Operant alcohol and saccharin self-administration
The rats were trained to self-administer 10% (v/v) alco-
hol solution during daily 30-min sessions in standard
operant conditioning chambers (Med Associates) until
stable responding was maintained (� 10% over the last
three sessions). The rats were first subjected to an over-
night session (12 h) in the operant chambers with access
to one lever (right lever) that delivered water on a fixed-
ratio 1 (FR1) schedule of reinforcement (i.e., each operant
response was reinforced with 0.1 ml of water). After 1 d
off, the rats were subjected to a 3-h session (FR1) with
access to the right lever that delivered 0.1 ml of alcohol. In
the next two sessions, the rats were subjected to 2-h and
1-h FR1 sessions, respectively, with the right lever deliv-
ering 0.1 ml of alcohol. After this training phase, all sub-
sequent sessions lasted 30 min, with both levers available
for water and alcohol (left lever for water and right lever for
alcohol) until stable levels of intake were reached. For the
saccharin self-administration study, the rats underwent
daily 30 min of FR1 sessions. Responses on the right lever
resulted in the delivery of 0.1 ml of saccharin (0.04%, w/v).
Lever presses on the left lever delivered 0.1 ml of water.
This training lasted two weeks until a stable baseline of
intake was reached. Behavioral testing occurred three
times per week during the dark phase (for the experimen-
tal design, see Figs. 1A, 6A).
Mechanical nociceptive von Frey test during alcohol
withdrawal
Mechanical nociception, reflected by hindpaw with-
drawal thresholds, was determined by an observer who
was blind to the experimental condition using von Frey
filaments, ranging from 8.511 to 281.838 g. JNJ-63533054
was administered orally in a between-subjects design
(n � 8–9) 60-min before starting the experiment. A test
session began after 10 min of habituation to the testing
environment. A series of von Frey filaments was applied
from below the wire mesh to the central region of the
plantar surface of the left hindpaw in ascending order,
beginning with the smallest filament (8.511 g). The fila-
ment was applied until buckling of the hair occurred, and
the filament remained in place for �2 s. Rapid withdrawal
of the hindpaw was considered a positive response. The
stimulus was incrementally increased until a positive re-
sponse was observed and then decreased until a negative
response was observed to determine a pattern of re-
sponses to apply to the statistical methods that were
described by Dixon (1980). Once the threshold was de-
termined for the left hindpaw, the same testing procedure
was applied to the right hindpaw after 5 min. The 50%
paw withdrawal threshold was calculated as Xf � k�,
where Xf is the last von Frey filament employed, k is the
Dixon value that corresponds to the response pattern,
and � is the mean difference between stimuli. Paw with-

 drawal thresholds were determined for alcohol-depen-
dent rats during withdrawal.
Somatic withdrawal score
Behavioral signs of withdrawal were measured using a
rating scale that was adapted from previous studies
(Macey et al., 1996; de Guglielmo et al., 2017). JNJ-
63533054 was administered orally in a between-subjects
design (n � 8–9) 60-min before beginning the experiment.
The observer was blind to the experimental condition. The
following signs were measured: ventromedial limb retrac-
tion, irritability to touch (vocalization), tail rigidity, abnor-
mal gait, and body tremors. Each sign was given a score
of 0–2, based on the following severity scale: 0 � no sign,
1 � moderate, and 2 � severe. The sum of the four
observation scores (0–8) was used as an operational
measure of withdrawal severity.
Effect of systemic JNJ-63533054 administration on
alcohol self-administration in nondependent and
alcohol-dependent rats
Once a stable baseline of operant alcohol self-
administration was reached, the rats were divided into
two groups: alcohol-dependent (n � 17) and nondepen-
dent (n � 12). A separate cohort of rats was trained to
self-administer saccharin (0.04%, w/v) and made alcohol-
dependent after stable operant saccharin self-admini-
stration was reached. The rats in the alcohol-dependent
groups were made dependent by CIE to alcohol vapor as
described previously (O’Dell et al., 2004; Ron and Barak,
2016). Briefly, the rats underwent cycles of 14 h of alcohol
vapor ON and 10 h of alcohol vapor OFF in their home
cages for four consecutive weeks with no operant self-
administration. Tail blood was collected during vapor ex-
posure and used to determine blood alcohol levels (BALs)
using gas chromatography. Vapor exposure was gradu-
ally increased until BALs ranged from 150 to 250 mg/dl.
After four weeks of vapor exposure, the rats resumed
operant self-administration sessions for four weeks to
allow them to escalate their alcohol intake. Rats that are
made dependent with CIE exhibit clinically relevant BALs,
ranging from 150 to 250 mg/dl during vapor exposure
(Gilpin et al., 2009), compulsive-like alcohol drinking (i.e.,
persistent drinking despite aversive, bitter taste of qui-
nine; Vendruscolo et al., 2012; Seif et al., 2013; Leão et al.,
2015; Kimbrough et al., 2017a), and the escalation of
alcohol drinking when given access to alcohol during
abstinence (O’Dell et al., 2004; Kimbrough et al., 2017a).
Additionally, alcohol dependence that is induced by alco-
hol vapor results in both somatic and motivational with-
drawal symptoms during both acute withdrawal and
protracted abstinence, including anxiety-like behavior,
irritability-like behavior, and mechanical hyperalgesia
(Macey et al., 1996; Valdez et al., 2002; Edwards et al.,
2012; Williams et al., 2012; Kallupi et al., 2014; Vendr-
uscolo and Roberts, 2014; de Guglielmo et al., 2016,
2017; Kimbrough et al., 2017b; Smith et al., 2017). Be-
havioral testing following systemic JNJ-63533054 admin-
istration occurred during acute withdrawal (6–8 h after
alcohol vapor was turned OFF), during which both brain
and BALs are negligible (Gilpin et al., 2009). Rats that
received intracerebral infusions of JNJ-63533054 under-
went surgery after stable, escalated alcohol intake was
reached. Alcohol-dependent rats were maintained on CIE
until the end of the experiment.
Quinine adulteration of alcohol
After behavioral testing, the rats were maintained on an
FR1 schedule of operant self-administration until stable
levels of alcohol self-administration were established
again. To further test for compulsive-like alcohol drinking,
quinine adulteration was used, which has been validated
as a measure of compulsive-like responding for alcohol
(Vendruscolo et al., 2012; Seif et al., 2013; Leão et al.,
2015; Kimbrough et al., 2017a). This test measures the
persistence of animals to consume alcohol despite the
aversive bitter taste of quinine. The alcohol solution was
adulterated with increasing concentrations of quinine
(0.005, 0.01, 0.025, and 0.05 g/l) and presented between
operant self-administration sessions (one concentration
per session). To test the selectivity of responses for adul-
terated alcohol, water intake was assessed using the
quinine concentration (0.025 g/l) at which a significant
difference in alcohol intake was observed between the
subgroups of rats.
Intracerebral surgery and effect of site-specific
microinjections of JNJ-63533054 on alcohol self-
administration in dependent rats
The rats were made dependent on alcohol using the
aforementioned protocol and then implanted with intrace-
rebral cannulae that targeted the medial habenula and
IPN. The coordinates were based on a previous study
(Tuesta et al., 2017) and modified slightly based on trial
infusions. For intracerebral surgery, the animals were
anesthetized with isoflurane (5% induction, 1.5–2.5%
maintenance). To reach the medial habenula, 24-gauge
guide cannulae (Plastics One) were implanted bilaterally
using the following coordinates with reference to bregma:
10° angle toward midline; anterior/posterior: -3.2 mm;
medial/lateral: �1.35 mm, dorsal/ventral: -3.3 mm from
dura. For the IPN, the coordinates were the following: 10°
angle toward midline; anterior/posterior: -6.72 mm; medi-
al/lateral: �1.6 mm; dorsal/ventral: -6.5 mm from dura.
During the injections, the 31-gauge injector needles ex-
tended 2 mm below the tip of the cannula for placement
into the targeted brain region. The animals were allowed
to recover for one week after surgery and thereafter re-
turned to the alcohol vapor chambers and allowed to
self-administer alcohol until the baseline level of alcohol
intake pre-surgery was restored. The rats were then
treated with either vehicle or JNJ-63533054 (0.25 �g/0.5
�l) according to a within-subjects Latin-square design
(counterbalanced for order). For the microinjections, an
infusion volume of 0.5 �l was delivered over 2 min using
a Hamilton syringe (Hamilton) that was attached to an
infusion pump (kdScientific) via 31-gauge injectors that
projected 2 mm beyond the tip of the cannulae. The
injectors were left in place for 1 min following the infusion
to allow for diffusion and reduce backflow. Cannula place-
ments were determined according to the Paxinos and
Watson rat brain atlas (Paxinos and Watson, 2007). The

 histologic verification of cannula placements revealed
three misplacements (two for the medial habenula and
one for the IPN); the data from these rats were excluded,
leaving six rats for habenular infusions and seven rats for
IPN infusions for the final analysis.
Experimental design and statistical analysis
The effects of systemic JNJ-63533054 administration
on alcohol self-administration were assessed in both non-
dependent (n � 12) and alcohol-dependent (n � 17) male
rats using a within-subjects design. To study the effect of
JNJ-6353054 on operant self-administration of a natural
reinforcer, saccharin, a separate cohort was made alcohol
dependent (n � 9) and trained to self-administer saccha-
rin during alcohol withdrawal. The data were analyzed
using one-way repeated-measures ANOVAs followed by
the Newman–Keuls multiple-comparison post hoc test.
The effects of systemic JNJ-63533054 administration on
mechanical nociception and somatic signs of withdrawal
in alcohol-dependent rats were then analyzed during al-
cohol withdrawal using a between-subjects design by
comparing the vehicle-treated control group (n � 8) with
the JNJ-63533054-treated group (n � 9). The data were
analyzed using unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test (for me-
chanical nociception) or the nonparametric Mann–Whitney
test (for somatic withdrawal signs). Quinine-adulterated al-
cohol intake was assessed in alcohol-dependent rats, in
which each rat received gradual increases in quinine-
adulterated alcohol solution. The data were analyzed using
two-way repeated-measures ANOVA followed by the New-
man–Keuls multiple-comparison post hoc test. At the end of
the quinine experiment, quinine-adulterated water intake
was analyzed using unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test.
Based on compulsive-like alcohol drinking, the effect of
JNJ-63533054 in alcohol-dependent rats was analyzed us-
ing repeated-measures two-way ANOVA followed by the
Newman–Keuls post hoc test. Cohen’s d was used to
calculate the effect size of JNJ-63533054 on paw with-
drawal thresholds separately in low-compulsive and high-
compulsive rats. A separate cohort of alcohol-dependent
rats (n � 8) was implanted with cannulae in both the medial
habenula and IPN. The effects of intracerebral infusions of
JNJ-63533054 on self-administration and mechanical noci-
ception were assessed using a within-subjects design. Data
from both experiments that intracerebrally infused JNJ-
63533054 (n � 6 for habenula and n � 7 for IPN) were
analyzed using repeated-measures one-way ANOVA fol-
lowed by the Newman–Keuls multiple-comparison post hoc
test. The statistical analyses were performed using Statistica
and GraphPad Prism 7 software. The statistical analyses,
data structure, and results are presented in Table 1.
Results
Systemic administration of the GPR139 receptor
agonist JNJ-63533054 selectively decreases alcohol
self-administration without affecting saccharin self-
administration in alcohol-dependent rats
The timeline of the experiment with systemic JNJ-
63533054 administration in alcohol-dependent rats is
shown in Figure 1A. The dependent animals significantly
escalated their alcohol intake after two weeks, starting in
the 6th test session (Fig. 1B). This was confirmed by
one-way repeated-measures ANOVA (F(12,192) � 2.618,
p � 0.0030) followed by the Newman–Keuls post hoc test
(p � 0.05). There was a significant increase in BALs from
week 5 to week 8 of alcohol exposure, confirmed by the
paired t test (t(16) � 7.301, p � 0.0001; Fig. 1C).
Once the alcohol-dependent rats reached a stable level
of operant responding for alcohol, a within-subjects de-
sign (n � 17; Fig. 2A) was used to evaluate the effects of
JNJ-63533054 on alcohol self-administration. The one-
way repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant
effect of systemic JNJ-63533054 administration on alco-
hol self-administration (F(4,64) � 16.92, p � 0.0001). The
Newman–Keuls post hoc test showed that JNJ-63533054
significantly reduced alcohol self-administration at the
dose of 30 mg/kg (p � 0.01), with no effect on water
intake at either dose of JNJ-63533054 (F(4,64) � 0.3664,
p � 0.8317; Fig. 2A). The median number of reinforcers
per 30-min self-administration session after escalation
was 50 reinforcers (Fig. 2B). JNJ-63533054 did not affect
alcohol self-administration in nondependent rats, con-
firmed by the one-way repeated-measures ANOVA (F(3,33) �
2.16, p � 0.1114; Fig. 2C). Water self-administration was
unaffected by JNJ-63533054 treatment (F(3,33) � 1.54, p �
0.2225) in nondependent rats. A separate cohort of rats
was made alcohol dependent, in which exposure to
alcohol vapor or JNJ-63533054 (30 mg/kg) had no
effect on saccharin self-administration (F(3.24) � 0.1766,
p � 0.9112; Fig. 2D) or water self-administration (F(3.24)
� 2.405, p � 0.0923), confirmed by the one-way
repeated-measures ANOVA.
Systemic administration of the GPR139 receptor
agonist JNJ-63533054 increases pain thresholds
during alcohol withdrawal, without affecting somatic
signs of withdrawal
Mechanical hyperalgesia and somatic signs of with-
drawal were evaluated 7-8 h into withdrawal using a
between-subjects design (n � 8–9). The results showed
a higher threshold for mechanical nociception in JNJ-
63533054-treated rats (Fig. 3A). This was confirmed by
the unpaired t test (t(15) � 2.943, p � 0.0101). No
significant differences in somatic withdrawal signs were
found between the two groups (Fig. 3B), confirmed by
the nonparametric Mann–Whitney U test (U � 25.5, p �
0.3214).
Alcohol-dependent rats with higher baseline alcohol
intake exhibit resistance to quinine adulteration
Based on the median reinforcers/session after escala-
tion in dependent rats, two distinct subgroups of rats
were identified: one with below-median baseline alcohol
intake (�50 reinforcers/session, n � 8) and one with
above-median baseline alcohol intake (�50 reinforcers/
session, n � 9; Fig. 4A). This was confirmed by a signif-
icant difference in baseline alcohol intake between the
two subgroups (t(15) � 4.908, p � 0.0002). Water intake
was not different between the two subgroups (t(15) �
0.8706, p � 0.3977; Fig. 4A). No significant difference in
body weight was found between the two subgroups (data

 not shown), indicating that the number of lever presses
and consequently alcohol intake were independent of
body weight. To further analyze compulsive-like respond-
ing for alcohol in these two subgroups, we used the
quinine adulteration test, which measures the persistence
of alcohol drinking despite the aversive bitter taste of
quinine. The subgroups of rats with low baseline alcohol
intake also exhibited low compulsive-like drinking, indi-
cated by 10-fold higher sensitivity to quinine (0.005 g/l)
compared with high-compulsive rats (0.05 g/l). Figure 4B
shows the average number of rewards during the quinine
adulteration test with each increasing concentration of
quinine between low-intake (i.e., low-compulsive) and
high-intake (i.e., high-compulsive) rats (n � 8 low-
compulsive rats, n � 9 high-compulsive rats). The two-
way repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant
time � group interaction (F(4,60) � 3.254, p � 0.0174) and
significant effects of quinine concentration (F(4,60) �
12.31, p � 0.0001) and group (F(1,15) � 20.29, p � 0.0004).
The Newman–Keuls multiple-comparison test confirmed
a significant difference between the subgroups of rats at
quinine concentrations of 0.005 g/l (p � 0.05), 0.025 g/l (p
� 0.01), and 0.05 g/l (p � 0.05). The Newman–Keuls
multiple-comparison post hoc test indicated that quinine
adulteration decreased lever pressing in the low-com-
pulsive group beginning at the lowest concentration of
quinine (0.005 g/l) compared with baseline (p � 0.05 for
0.05 g/l, p � 0.001 for 0.01 g/l, p � 0.0001 for 0.05 g/l),
whereas only the highest concentration of quinine (0.05
g/l) decreased lever-pressing in the high-compulsive
group (p � 0.05). To verify that the effect of quinine was
selective for alcohol and did not merely indicate a differ-
ence in taste sensitivity between low-compulsive and
high-compulsive rats, we tested the quinine concentra-
tion (0.025 g/l) that caused the most significant differ-
ence in alcohol intake between groups (p � 0.01) on
quinine-adulterated water intake between groups (Fig.
4C). The t test indicated no significant difference in
lever-pressing for quinine-adulterated water (t(15) �
0.4353, p � 0.6695).

 JNJ-63533054 decreases alcohol self-administration
only in a subgroup of high-intake rats that exhibit
compulsive-like drinking
Dependent rats were divided into two subgroups
according to both the baseline escalated number of self-
administered reinforcers [below the median for low-com-
pulsive rats and above the median for high-compulsive rats
(50)] and compulsive-like alcohol consumption in the quinine
adulteration test, with a �20% reduction of alcohol intake at
the lowest concentration of quinine (0.005 g/l) in low-
compulsive rats (i.e., 10-fold higher sensitivity to 0.005 g/l
quinine) compared with high-compulsive rats. High-com-
pulsive rats (p � 0.00014; Fig. 5A) and low-compulsive rats
(p � 0.0287) escalated their alcohol intake from pre-vapor
baseline to post-vapor baseline (i.e., escalation), confirmed
by the two-way repeated-measures ANOVA (subgroup �
treatment interaction, F4,60 � 3.191, p � 0.0192) followed by
the Newman–Keuls post hoc test. The Newman–Keuls post
hoc test showed that JNJ-63533054 significantly reduced
alcohol self-administration at a dose of 30 mg/kg (p �
0.00274).
JNJ-63533054
did
not
affect
alcohol
self-
administration in low-compulsive rats at either dose tested
(p � 0.05). The two-way repeated-measures ANOVA indi-
cated no significant difference in water intake between pre-
vapor and post-vapor and no effect of JNJ-63533054
treatment in either high-compulsive rats or low-compulsive
rats, reflected by a lack of interaction (F(4,60) � 0.2027, p �
0.9359). JNJ-63533054 (30 mg/kg) induced a 31.6 � 5.9%
(mean � SEM) reduction of intake compared with baseline in
high-compulsive rats (t(8) � 5.357, p � 0.0007; Fig. 5B),
whereas no significant reduction was observed in low-
compulsive rats (14.7 � 21.1%, t(7) � 0.6963, p � 0.5087).
Mechanical hyperalgesia was also analyzed in the dif-
ferent subgroups (n � 3-5/group, data not shown). Pre-
treatment with JNJ-63533054 caused a 121.18 � 8.11%
increase in paw withdrawal thresholds in low-compulsive
rats and 174.39 � 42.06% increase in high-compulsive
rats. The analysis of the effect size showed that JNJ-

had
a

in
high-
compulsive rats (Cohen’s d � 0.7593 for low-compulsive
rats and 1.1740 for high-compulsive rats).
Intra-habenular but not intra-IPN infusion of JNJ-
63533054 decreases alcohol self-administration and
mechanical hyperalgesia in alcohol-dependent rats
To identify the brain circuits that mediate the effects of
JNJ-63533054 on alcohol self-administration and with-
drawal-induced mechanical hyperalgesia, a separate co-
continued
baseline (BSL) vs escalated baseline (ESC)], the effect of JNJ-63533054 on alcohol self-administration was evaluated using a
within-subjects design (n � 17). One hour before the session, the rats were orally administered a single dose of JNJ-63533054.
JNJ-63533054 significantly reduced alcohol self-administration at a dose of 30 mg/kg (��p � 0.05). Water intake was unaffected by
JNJ-63533054 treatment. B, The median number of reinforced responses for alcohol in alcohol-dependent rats was 50 after
escalation. C, Once a stable baseline of alcohol intake was reached (�10% over the last three sessions), the effect of JNJ-63533054
on alcohol intake was tested in nondependent rats. One hour before the session, the rats were orally administered a single dose of
JNJ-63533054 in a within-subjects design (n � 12). JNJ-63533054 did not significantly affect alcohol self-administration in
nondependent rats. Water self-administration was unaffected by JNJ-63533054 treatment. D, The effect of JNJ-63533054 (30 mg/kg,
p.o.) on 0.04% (w/v) saccharin self-administration was tested in a separate cohort of rats that were made alcohol dependent by
chronic intermittent alcohol vapor exposure. Both saccharin and water self-administration was unaffected by vapor exposure or
JNJ-63533054.

were verified.
Discussion
The present study showed that GPR139 receptor ago-
nism decreases alcohol intake selectively in alcohol-
dependent rats, without affecting saccharin intake in
alcohol-dependent rats or alcohol intake in nondependent
rats. Additionally, the reduction of alcohol intake was
observed in a subgroup of alcohol-dependent rats that
exhibited a compulsive intake-like phenotype. JNJ-
63533054 had no effect on somatic withdrawal signs
during acute withdrawal, but a decrease in withdrawal-
induced mechanical hyperalgesia was observed after
systemic JNJ-63533054 administration. Importantly, the
intra-habenular but not intra-IPN infusion of JNJ-
63533054 decreased both alcohol self-administration and
withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia in alcohol-dependent
rats. Overall, we found that GPR139 receptor activation
specifically in the habenula selectively reduced key
addiction-like behaviors in an advanced preclinical model
of alcohol use disorder.
These results demonstrate that GPR139 activation is
only effective in alcohol-dependent rats, without affecting
alcohol intake in nondependent rats. Additionally, JNJ-
63533054 had no effect on saccharin intake in alcohol-
dependent rats. The selective effect of JNJ-63533054 on
alcohol intake suggests that GPR139 may be involved in
functional processes that underlie drug dependence and
Figure 4. Dependent rats that exhibit high alcohol drinking exhibit high compulsive-like alcohol drinking. A, Two distinct subgroups
of rats in the alcohol-dependent group were identified according to the median of 50 alcohol-reinforced responses during baseline
alcohol self-administration after escalation. Baseline alcohol intake was significantly higher in high-compulsive rats compared with
low-compulsive rats (���p � 0.001, n � 8–9). B, To further test the compulsivity of alcohol intake, the rats in the low- and
high-compulsive subgroups underwent the quinine adulteration test. The rats were subjected to operant alcohol self-administration
sessions with increasing concentrations of quinine that were added to the alcohol solution. The data are expressed as the percentage
change relative to the escalated baseline (i.e., lever presses for alcohol alone before quinine adulteration). High-compulsive rats
maintained their alcohol drinking despite the aversive, bitter taste of quinine in the alcohol solution (i.e., they were high-compulsive
alcohol drinkers). Low-compulsive rats decreased their alcohol intake (�20% from baseline) starting with the lowest concentration of
quinine (0.005 g/l; i.e., they were low-compulsive), whereas only the highest quinine concentration (0.05 g/l) decreased alcohol intake
in high-compulsive rats; #p � 0.05, ##p � 0.01, ###p � 0.001, ####p � 0.0001, significant difference compared with own baseline;
�p � 0.05, ���p � 0.001, significant difference between low-compulsive rats and high-compulsive rats. C, The intake of quinine (0.025
g/l)-adulterated water was not different between low-compulsive and high-compulsive rats.

 addiction (e.g., by altering the level of GPR139 expression
in the brain) and not merely in the reduction of the reward-
ing effects of alcohol or saccharin.
The analysis of individual differences in compulsive-like
alcohol drinking indicated that GPR139 receptor activa-
tion was particularly effective in alcohol-dependent ani-
mals that exhibited high, compulsive-like alcohol drinking.
The quinine adulteration test has been previously vali-
dated as a model of compulsive-like drinking (Vendr-
uscolo et al., 2012; Seif et al., 2013; Leão et al., 2015;
Kimbrough et al., 2017a). In the model of CIE to alcohol
vapor, abstinence from alcohol has been shown to trigger
an aversive withdrawal syndrome, during which rats ex-
hibit somatic and motivational signs, including hyperalge-
sia (Edwards et al., 2012; Vendruscolo and Roberts, 2014;
de Guglielmo et al., 2017). Additionally, withdrawal from
chronic alcohol exposure increases pain sensitivity in
alcoholic-dependent humans (Jochum et al., 2010), and
chronic intermittent voluntary alcohol intake has been
shown to induce hyperalgesia during withdrawal in rats
(Fu et al., 2015). Although JNJ-63533054 had no effect on
somatic signs of withdrawal, it significantly decreased
withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia, measured by paw-
withdrawal thresholds in the von Frey test. The increase in
paw-withdrawal thresholds was greater in high-compul-
sive rats compared with low-compulsive rats (174.39 �
42.06% and 121.15 � 8.11% increases, respectively). In
the CIE model, withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia is usu-
ally associated with a 25–35% decrease in mechanical
thresholds compared with naive or nondependent ani-
mals (Edwards et al., 2012; de Guglielmo et al., 2017).
Therefore, we hypothesize that JNJ-63533054 treatment
may have completely restored pain thresholds to normal
levels. Future studies that employ longitudinal designs will
be required to test this hypothesis.
Interestingly, lesions of the medial habenula have been
shown to increase pain sensitivity and increase the anal-
gesic effect of morphine (Mészáros et al., 1985). A recent
study found that the analgesic effect of morphine is me-
diated by the medial habenula (Darcq et al., 2012). Given
that the highest expression of GPR139 receptors is found
in the medial habenula (Matsuo et al., 2005; Liu et al.,
2015; Hitchock et al., 2016), GPR139 receptors may mod-
ulate opioidergic systems in the medial habenula to pro-
duce the analgesic effects that were observed in the
present study. Indeed, a comparison of rodent and human
transcriptome data revealed a specific GPR139-including
cluster of highly expressed habenular genes that are com-
mon to humans and rodents that also notably express �
opioid receptors (Boulos et al., 2017). We observed no
effect of JNJ-63533054 on somatic withdrawal signs. The

alcohol intake [����p � 0.0001, pre-vapor baseline (BSL) vs escalated baseline (ESC)]. JNJ-63533054 (30 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly
decreased alcohol intake in high-compulsive rats (��p � 0.01). Rats in the low-compulsive subgroup escalated their alcohol intake
after alcohol vapor exposure (�p � 0.05), but JNJ-63533054 had no effect on alcohol intake in low-compulsive rats (n � 8). B,
JNJ-63533054 (30 mg/kg) decreased (�30% reduction) alcohol self-administration in high-compulsive rats (���p � 0.0001) but had
no effect in low-compulsive rats.

 was selective to hyperalgesia, further indicating that
GPR139 may interact with the opioidergic system in the
habenula.
JNJ-63533054
is
a
selective,
high-affinity,
small-
molecule agonist of GPR139 receptors that has good
drug-like properties, including favorable pharmacokinet-
ics and brain penetration after oral dosing in rats, with no
cytochrome P450 (CYP450) inhibition (Dvorak et al.,
2015). To our knowledge, only one behavioral study has
been published to date regarding GPR139 receptors, in
which the GPR139 receptor agonist JNJ-63533054 (10
and 30 mg/kg) induced spontaneous hypolocomotion
during the first hour after the injection (Liu et al., 2015). To
avoid the potential confound of hypolocomotion, we de-
layed the testing of alcohol self-administration for 1 h after
systemic JNJ-6353054 administration. Considering that
we did not observe any decrease in water drinking in any
of the groups, did not observe decreases in alcohol drink-
ing in nondependent rats, and did not observe a reduction
of operant responding for the natural reinforcer saccharin,
hypolocomotion unlikely explains the present results.
One limitation of the present study is the lack of
GPR139 antagonist administration. The lack of availability
of such antagonists is a known weakness in the field.
Although several small-molecule antagonists have been
shown to have reasonable potency in vitro, little to no
selectivity data have been reported (Hu et al., 2009; Wang
et al., 2015). Additionally, no studies of safety and efficacy
in vivo have been reported. Whether these compounds
are selective and brain-penetrant, have favorable pharma-
cokinetics, and are suitable for in vivo experiments re-
mains to be investigated.
The main signal transduction pathway of GPR139 re-
ceptors remains unknown, but previous studies have re-
ported signaling through Gi (Süsens et al., 2006), Gs (Hu
et al., 2009), and particularly Gq (Matsuo et al., 2005; Shi

 et al., 2011; Isberg et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015; Bayer
Andersen et al., 2016) protein pathways. The endogenous
aromatic L-amino acids L-tryptophan (a precursor of se-
rotonin) and L-phenylalanine (a precursor of tyrosine) ac-
tivate GPR139 receptors (Isberg et al., 2014; Wang et al.,
2015). Interestingly, a recent study reported that trypto-
phan depletion was associated with compulsive-like be-
havior in rats (Merchán et al., 2017), thus indicating a
possible link between GPR139 receptors and the com-
pulsive-like behavior that was observed in the present
study. Moreover, low plasma concentrations of trypto-
phan have been suggested to be correlated with alcohol
abuse in humans (Virkkunen and Linnoila, 1990). With-
drawal from alcohol has also been shown to significantly
decrease brain tryptophan concentrations (Bano et al.,
1996). GPCR-interacting proteins are known to regulate
the activity, trafficking, and localization of GPCRs (Magal-
haes et al., 2012). Low plasma and brain tryptophan
concentrations that are induced by chronic alcohol intake
(Virkkunen and Linnoila, 1990; Bano et al., 1996) may thus
alter the function and/or expression of GPR139 (e.g.,
through upregulation). Additionally, withdrawal from alco-
hol increases the expression of the transcription factor
Fos in the habenula (Li et al., 2016), which also interacts
with the GH16I020080 regulatory element of the GPR139
gene, acting as an enhancer of the gene (Genecards,
2018). These alternative mechanisms may explain why the
GPR139 receptor agonist was effective only in alcohol-
dependent rats, specifically in the subgroup that had a
compulsive-like phenotype and exhibited high alcohol in-
take. However, further studies are necessary to better
investigate this phenomenon.
Experiments that characterize the pharmacology and
function of GPR139 receptors and identify antagonist
compounds with favorable pharmacokinetics in vivo are
currently ongoing (Wang et al., 2015; Hitchock et al.,
2016; Shehata et al., 2016; Nøhr et al., 2017). GPR139
receptor mRNA is abundantly expressed in the habenula,
ventrolateral region of the caudate putamen, zona incerta,
and medial mammillary nucleus. High and specific ex-
pression of the GPR139 receptor has been found in the
habenula and septum in mice, with the highest immuno-
reactivity in the medial habenula (Matsuo et al., 2005;
Wang et al., 2015; Hitchock et al., 2016). A low level of
expression has also been detected in the IPN (Liu et al.,
2015). The habenula is a central structure that regulates
monoaminergic systems, notably dopamine and sero-
tonin, and integrates cognitive, emotional, and sensory
processing (Boulos et al., 2017). The habenula receives
inputs from the basal ganglia, septum, hypothalamus,
anterior cingulate cortex, and medial prefrontal cortex and
projects to several midbrain regions, most importantly the
IPN and rostromedial tegmental nucleus, regulating the
activity of monoaminergic nuclei (Herkenham and Nauta,
1979; Bianco and Wilson, 2009). Thus, the habenula is a
crucial intersection between cortical and subcortical
structures that are implicated in emotion, stress, and
reward processing (Batalla et al., 2017). Both the lateral
and medial habenula have been implicated as parts of
intrinsic reinforcement circuitry, making it an interesting
target for addiction studies (Matsumoto and Hikosaka,
2007; Hsu et al., 2014; Velasquez et al., 2014). Emerging
evidence suggests that medial habenula-IPN circuitry is
critical in addiction and anxiety (McLaughlin et al., 2017).
GPR139 receptors are predominantly expressed in the
medial habenula. Therefore, we hypothesize that the re-
duction of alcohol self-administration in dependent rats
that was observed in the present study may be mediated
by habenular circuits. Importantly, we found that the local
activation of GPR139 receptors in the habenula but not
IPN reversed the escalation of alcohol self-administration
in alcohol-dependent rats and decreased withdrawal-
induced hyperalgesia, further indicating that the habenula
is a mediator of the effects of GPR139 agonism on alcohol
dependence.
In summary, the present study provided robust preclinical
evidence that GPR139 receptor activation reverses com-
pulsive-like alcohol drinking and decreases withdrawal-
induced hyperalgesia in a subgroup of alcohol-dependent rats
that exhibit symptoms of alcohol dependence. The reductions
of alcohol self-administration and withdrawal-induced hy-
peralgesia were mediated by the habenula and not IPN.
JNJ-63533054 is orally bioavailable and has a favorable
pharmacokinetic profile. It selectively decreased alcohol in-
take in a subgroup of dependent rats that exhibited a
compulsive-like phenotype, suggesting that this GPR139
receptor agonist may be a candidate for further drug devel-
opment for the treatment of alcohol use disorder. Further
studies are needed to determine the underlying mechanisms
by which GPR139 receptors regulate compulsive-like alco-
hol drinking and mechanical hyperalgesia and whether tar-
geting GPR139 receptors may also affect addiction-like
behaviors with other drugs of abuse and/or non-drug-
related compulsivity.
