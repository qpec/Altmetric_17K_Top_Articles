Background: This before-and-after study measured the impact of a
change in testing methods from culture to nucleic acid amplification testing
(NAAT) on the detection of pharyngeal and rectal gonorrhea in men who
have sex with men (MSM) on a sexual health service level, including the
effect on subgroups anticipated to have higher rates of gonorrhea.
Methods: In March 2015, Melbourne Sexual Health Centre changed its
laboratory method for gonococcal testing from culture to NAAT using the
Aptima Combo 2 and Aptima GC tests. We compared the proportion of
tests positive for rectal and pharyngeal gonorrhea in MSM using culture
in 2014 with those using NAAT in 2015.
Results: The proportion of tests positive for rectal gonorrhea by NAAT
was double that obtained by culture (8% vs 3.9%; prevalence ratio [PR],
2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8–2.4) and 5-fold for pharyngeal gon-
orrhea (8.3% vs 1.6%; PR, 5.2; 95% CI, 4.2–6.4). Similar increases in test
positivity were observed in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive
and HIV-negative men. By NAAT, test positivity for rectal gonorrhea was
higher in HIV
-positive compared with HIV-negative men (15.4% vs
7.3%; PR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.7–2.6). Culture and NAAT had similar test pos-
itivity for rectal gonorrhea among men who reported contact with gonor-
rhea (24.9% vs 25.3%, PR 1.0, 95% CI 0.8–1.4) and men who presented
with symptoms of proctitis (22.2% vs 27.9%, PR 1.3, 95% CI 0.8–2.0).
Conclusions: A switch from culture to Aptima Combo 2 testing for
extragenital gonorrhea in MSM increased detection and was most marked
for pharyngeal infections.
G
uidelines recommend screening men who have sex with men
(MSM) for rectal and pharyngeal gonorrhea,1,2 which are
mostly asymptomatic,3,4 whereas urethral gonorrhea usually pre-
sents with symptoms of urethritis.3,5 Previously, culture was the
laboratory method of choice for gonorrhea testing, but this has
been superseded by nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT),
which has been shown to be more sensitive for detection of gonor-
rhea at the rectum6–8 and pharynx.8,9
This before-and-after study aimed to measure the impact
of a change in testing methods from culture to NAATon the detec-
tion of rectal and pharyngeal gonorrhea in MSM on a sexual
health service level. We also examined the effect of this change
on the detection of gonorrhea in subgroups of men where higher
rates of gonorrhea are anticipated.
METHODS
This study was conducted at the Melbourne Sexual Health
Centre. Men who have sex with men attending the clinic for sexu-
ally transmitted infection screening were screened according to
Australian guidelines,10 which included pharyngeal and anal
swabs for gonorrhea. Tests for urethral gonorrhea were performed
only in men with symptomatic urethritis. We included data from
clinic visits for all men who reported sex with men, and who
had been tested for gonorrhea at the rectum and/or pharynx. To ex-
clude tests of cure, we excluded visits from men who tested for
gonorrhea within 30 days of a previous gonorrhea test.
Before March 2015, all testings for gonorrhea comprised
culture of clinician-collected anal and pharyngeal swabs, as de-
scribed elsewhere.11 In late March 2015, laboratory testing changed
from culture to NAATusing the Aptima Combo 2 (AC2) assay for
screening, and the Aptima GC test for confirmation of all positive
samples, on the Hologic Panther Platform.12 Culture testing con-
tinued for a month (April 2015) after the introduction of NAAT.
We compared detection of rectal and pharyngeal gonorrhea
between 2 periods: the “culture period” (April to December 2014)
and the “NAAT period” (April to December 2015). Subgroup
analyses were conducted for MSM reporting recent sexual contact
with gonorrhea, and MSM who presented with symptomatic
proctitis, as defined elsewhere.13,14 We compared gonorrhea pos-
itivity between HIV-positive and HIV-negative MSM. We also
compared NAAT and culture detection in men tested using both
methods during the month of dual testing.

 Statistical analyses were conducted using STATA (version
13.1). 95% confidence intervals (CI) for gonorrhea test positivity
were calculated using the “exact” binomial distribution. Preva-
lence ratios (PR) were calculated using generalized linear models
with log-link and binomial distribution. Data for the month of dual
culture and NAAT testing within individuals were treated as paired
data and analyzed using McNemar's tests.
We assessed whether underlying population prevalence of
gonorrhea may have differed in the 2 periods by comparing patient
sexual risk behavior and by determining the positivity of urethral
gonorrhea by culture as a proxy for gonorrhea incidence. Each
period covered similar seasons to control for potential seasonal
differences in gonorrhea rates.15
Ethical approval was obtained from the Alfred Hospital Re-
search Ethics Committee (424/15).
RESULTS
Men who have sex with men in the culture period were sim-
ilar to MSM in the NAAT period with regard to age, HIV status,
and number of sexual partners (Table 1). Slightly more men re-
ported consistent use of condoms for receptive and/or insertive
anal sex in the culture period compared with the NAAT period
(50.3% vs 52.8%, P = 0.011).
Among all MSM tested for extragenital gonorrhea, 3.9% of
anal swabs were positive for gonorrhea during the culture period,
and 8.0% during the NAAT period (PR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.8–2.4)
(Table 1). 1.6% of pharyngeal swabs were positive for gonorrhea
during the culture period, and 8.3% during the NAAT period
(PR, 5.2; 95% CI, 4.2–6.4) (Table 1).
Among HIV-positive men, the positivity of rectal gonor-
rhea increased from 9.6% to 15.4% (PR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2–2.2);
and the positivity of pharyngeal gonorrhea increased from 1.5%
to 9.9% (PR, 6.8; 95% CI, 3.4–13.5). Among HIV-negative men,
the positivity of rectal gonorrhea increased from 3.3% to 7.3%
(PR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.9–2.6), and the positivity of pharyngeal gon-
orrhea increased from 1.6% to 8.1% (PR, 5.0; 95% CI, 4.0–6.2)
(Table 1). Using NAAT, test positivity for gonorrhea at the pharynx
was similar for HIV-positive and HIV-negative men (9.9% vs 8.1%;
PR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.95–1.55), but positivity at the rectum was
double in HIV
-positive compared with HIV
-negative men (15.4% vs
7.3%; PR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.7–2.6).
Among men who reported contact with another man with
gonorrhea, there was no difference in test positivity for rectal gon-
orrhea by culture (24.9%) compared with NAAT (25.3%). By con-
trast, test positivity for pharyngeal gonorrhea was 3 times higher
by NAAT (25.8%) compared with culture (8.7%) (PR, 3.0; 95%
CI, 1.9–4.7). Among men with symptomatic proctitis, there was
no significant difference in test positivity for rectal gonorrhea by
culture or NAAT, at 22.2% and 27.9%, respectively (PR, 1.3;
95% CI, 0.8–2.0) (Table 1).
During the period of dual culture and NAAT testing, 702
MSM were tested for rectal gonorrhea using both methods. Of the
67 MSM positive for rectal gonorrhea by NAAT, 39 tested positive
by culture, representing sensitivity of 58% for rectal gonorrhea
(Table 2A). Seven hundred sixty-three MSM tested for pharyngeal
gonorrhea using NAAT and culture. Of the 68 MSM positive for
pharyngeal gonorrhea by NAAT, 18 tested positive by culture
(Table 2B), representing sensitivity of 26% for pharyngeal gonorrhea,
which was significantly lower than for rectal gonorrhea (P = 0.02).
DISCUSSION
This study demonstrated that a change from culture to
NAAT resulted in a substantial increase in detection of rectal and
pharyngeal gonorrhea, of 2-fold and 5-fold, respectively. Although

 commercially available, gonorrhea NAATs have not been vali-
dated for use at extragenital sites, our results support current
guidelines that recommend NAAT for screening of rectal and pha-
ryngeal gonorrhea.2,16 Culture remains important for surveillance
for antimicrobial resistance.17
The higher sensitivity of NAAT in our study was particu-
larly striking for the detection of pharyngeal gonococci. A previous
study showed that gonococcal loads were higher for infections that
were both NAAT-positive and culture-positive compared with
NAAT-positive culture-negative infections, suggesting that culture
may miss lower-load gonococcal infections.18 In the same study,
gonococcal loads at the pharynx were significantly lower than
those at the rectum.18 This might explain why we found such a
striking increase in detection of pharyngeal gonorrhea after switching
from culture to NAAT, particularly as the AC2 assay has superior
sensitivity over other NAATs.6,7,9
A similar US study by Barbee et al19 found that gonorrhea
detection increased by 8% for rectal infections and by 12% for
pharyngeal infections after changing from culture to the AC2 test,
this increase in gonorrhea detection is smaller than in our study.
However, in Barbee's study diagnoses of urethral gonorrhea de-
clined significantly between their period of culture testing (2010)
and AC2 testing (2011), suggesting a decline in the population
prevalence of gonorrhea. After adjusting for this decline, they
found that NAAT increased detection of pharyngeal gonorrhea
by 74% and rectal gonorrhea by 66%. Our study also found a de-
cline in cases of urethral gonorrhea, but this was not statistically
significant. Another possible explanation for the difference between
Barbee's finding and ours is that a proportion of samples in their
study were self-collected: 15% of pharyngeal swabs and 43% of
rectal swabs, whereas specimens in our study were clinician-
collected. Previous studies have shown that optimal detection of
pharyngeal gonorrhea is dependent on the adequacy of sampling,
and this applies whether using culture or NAAT.11,20,21 The impor-
tance of sampling technique for the optimal detection of pharyn-
geal gonorrhea was emphasized to clinicians at our clinic before
the start of this evaluation.
The increase in detection of pharyngeal and rectal gonor-
rhea was similar for HIV-positive and HIV-negative men. How-
ever, HIV-positive men had double the NAAT positivity of rectal
gonorrhea compared with HIV-negative men, with no difference
in pharyngeal gonorrhea by NAAT. Higher rates of gonorrhea in
HIV-positive compared with HIV-negative MSM have recently
been reported in the United Kingdom22 and may reflect higher fre-
quency of condomless receptive anal sex.23
Among men reporting contact with gonorrhea, NAAT in-
creased detection of pharyngeal gonorrhea 3-fold, but detection
of rectal gonorrhea was similar for culture and NAAT. We specu-
late that these men may have had high gonococcal loads in their
rectum and thus relatively high positivity by culture. Hypotheti-
cally, MSM with high rectal gonococcal loads may be more likely
to transmit infection to partners who then develop symptomatic
urethritis, resulting in partner notification. Men with symptomatic
proctitis had similar gonorrhea positivity by NAAT and culture.
This finding fits with the finding that men with symptomatic
proctitis have higher gonococcal loads,18 which may explain
why culture performs relatively well in these men.
This was a before-and-after study; hence, our results may
have been affected by changes in the underlying prevalence of
gonorrhea during the comparison periods. Numbers of sexual
partners were similar in the two periods, but condom use was
slightly less consistent in the NAAT period. Cases of urethral gon-
orrhea were somewhat fewer during the NAAT period.
This study demonstrates the superior sensitivity of NAAT
compared to culture for the detection of extragenital gonorrhea
in MSM on a health service level, particularly for pharyngeal in-
fections. The improvement in detection by NAAT was similar
among HIV-positive and HIV-negative MSM.
