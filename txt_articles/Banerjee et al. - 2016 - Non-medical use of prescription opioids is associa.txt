 Design—Using a multivariable Cox regression model, we analyzed data from a prospective, 
multi-site, observational study of HIV-positive and an age/race/site matched control group of HIV-
negative veterans in care in the United States. Approximately annual behavioral assessments were 
conducted and contained self-reported measures of NMUPO and heroin use.
Setting—Veterans Health Administration (VHA) infectious disease and primary care clinics in 
Atlanta, Baltimore, New York, Houston, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, and Washington, DC.
Participants—A total of 3,396 HIV-infected and uninfected patients enrolled in the Veterans 
Aging Cohort Study who reported no lifetime NMUPO or heroin use, had no opioid use disorder 
diagnoses at baseline, and who were followed between 2002 and 2012.
Measurements—The primary outcome measure was self-reported incident heroin use and the 
primary exposure of interest was new onset NMUPO. Our final model was adjusted for 
sociodemographics, pain interference, prior diagnoses of post-traumatic stress disorder and/or 
depression, and self-reported other substance use.
Findings—Using a multivariable Cox regression model, we found that NMUPO was positively 
and independently associated with heroin initiation (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] = 5.43, 95%CL: 
4.01, 7.35).
Conclusions—New onset non-medical use of prescription opioids (NMUPO) is a strong risk 
factor for heroin initiation among HIV-infected and uninfected veterans in the United States who 
reported no previous history of NMUPO or illicit opioid use.

INTRODUCTION
Heroin use and opioid use disorders are serious public health problems (1). The U.S. Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that the total number of heroin-
attributable overdose deaths increased five-fold from 2001 to 2013, with 8,257 heroin-
related deaths in 2013 alone (2). The substantial increase in heroin use and heroin-
attributable overdose rates may be linked to the growth in sales, use, and misuse of 
prescription opioids (3). Over the last decade, the number of opioid prescriptions dispensed 
in the U.S. increased by 48% (4, 5). Concomitantly, the non-medical use of prescription 
opioids (NMUPO)—operationally defined in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health 
as the use of prescription opioids “without a prescription of the individual's own or simply 
for the experience or feeling the drugs cause”—is increasingly common (6). The last 15 
years has seen sharp rises in NMUPO (6–8), with 4.5 million individuals reporting NMUPO 
in the past month in 2013 (9). Canadian data estimates that approximately 4.8% of the 
general population used prescription opioids non-medically in 2009 and as the demand for 
prescription opioids has increased, so too has the availability of diverted prescription 
opioids.(10) In the past two decades, the use of opioids has also increased significantly in 
Europe.(11) In particular, there is a high prevalence of misuse of diverted opioids among 
drug using populations in England and Scotland.(11)

 Persons who engage in NMUPO may be at a higher risk for transitioning to heroin use, in 
part because heroin has become more accessible and less expensive than prescription opioids 
in many US settings (12–14). A nationally representative survey found that four out of five 
recent heroin initiates reported prior NMUPO, and the rate of heroin initiation among prior 
nonmedical prescription opioid users was approximately 19 times greater than those who did 
not report nonmedical use (15). Heroin initiation is particularly troubling because of the 
additional risks associated with heroin use, including unknown purity and contaminants, 
overdose, and injection-associated infections and vascular disease (12, 16). Transition from 
NMUPO to heroin also represents an increasingly prominent pathway leading to opioid-
related mortality (17).
U.S. military veterans represent a particularly high-risk population for illicit substance use 
and abuse (18–20). Chronic pain is a significant problem among veterans (21), and is 
commonly treated with opioid analgesics (22). Veterans also have high rates of mental health 
conditions that further increase the risk for NMUPO (23). However, it is poorly understood 
whether NMUPO plays a role in veterans' risk for initiating heroin use, particularly those 
veterans from newer eras, including Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi 
Freedom (24).
To address this critical public health problem, we examined the relationship between new 
onset NMUPO and heroin initiation among veterans. We aimed to: 1) identify risk factors 
for heroin initiation among participants enrolled in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study; 2) 
calculate the crude incidence rate of heroin initiation in this high risk population; and 3) 
compare the hazard of heroin initiation between participants with self-reported NMUPO and 
no prior NMUPO.
METHODS
Data sources
This research utilizes data from the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS); detailed data 
collection and survey methodology for VACS are described elsewhere (25–31). The VACS is 
an ongoing, prospective cohort study of HIV-infected and uninfected veterans receiving 
medical care at 8 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) sites located throughout the United 
States. Since June 2002, VACS has enrolled over 7,000 patients from the infectious disease 
or general medical clinics in Atlanta, Baltimore, Houston, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, 
Washington D.C., and multiple sites in New York City. Participants in VACS are similar to 
other veterans receiving care within the VA, with the exception of participants being older 
and more predominantly black (30). This comprehensive, longitudinal database contains 
variables from surveys completed approximately every 18 months, available from 
2002-2012. The survey data is also linked to robust VA electronic medical records (EMR) 
containing data on prescribed medications, medical and substance use diagnoses, and 
laboratory results for each patient. The VACS was approved by the institutional review 
boards at each participating VHA Medical Center and affiliated academic institutions.

 Participant eligibility
The flow chart illustrating the selection of eligible participants is illustrated in Figure 1. Of 
7,324 potentially eligible VACS participants, 2,792 (38.1%) were excluded since they 
reported “yes” to ever using a prescription opioid non-medically or heroin use at baseline. 
Of these participants, we excluded those who reported any injection drug use at baseline, or 
who were previously diagnosed with opioid dependence based on linked EMR records 
(ICD-9 code 304.0) (n= 399). Finally, we excluded participants who were missing or had 
invalid NMUPO and heroin use responses in all five follow-up surveys (n = 186) or only 
completed the baseline survey (n=551). Using data from the VHA Patient Treatment File, 
the Beneficiary Identification Records Locating System (which tracks VHA death benefits, 
the Medicare Vital Status file, and the Social Security National Death index, we identified 
203 (36.9%) deaths among those participants who only completed the baseline survey. We 
compared the characteristics of those who did not complete at least one follow-up visit due 
to death or other reasons with those who were eligible (see Supplemental File). We 
accounted for biases arising from potential differential loss to follow-up in weighted 
statistical analyses (see below). The final analytic sample consisted of 3,396 veterans.
Measures
We operationalized the main exposure of NMUPO using responses to two different survey 
questions. In the first two of five survey waves, participants were shown a list of the 
following substances: “marijuana, cocaine/crack, stimulants, heroin, and prescription opioids 
(morphine, codeine, Vicodin, Percocet, OxyContin)” and asked “For each of the following 
drugs, please fill in the oval that best indicates how often in the past 12 months you have 
used each drug.” Those participants who reported any use of prescription opioids were 
categorized as reporting NMUPO. In the final three follow-up survey waves participants 
were asked, “Now think only about the past 12 months. On average, how many days each 
week in the past 12 months did you use any prescription pain reliever that was not 
prescribed for you or that you took only for the experience or feeling that it caused (32)?” 
Again, participants reporting any frequency of use were categorized as reporting NMUPO. 
Participants who experienced the outcome of interest (i.e., heroin initiation) in the same year 
that they initiated NMUPO were included in the analysis; thus, new onset NMUPO was 
considered to occur prior to or concurrently with heroin initiation.
Self-reported heroin initiation was ascertained based on respondent endorsement of 
following time-updated survey item: “How often in the past year have you used each drug – 
Heroin?” A heroin initiation event was defined as change in respondent's answer to the 
previous survey question from “Never”, to a response indicating some frequency of heroin 
use in the previous year.
Selection of other independent variables and potential confounders of the relationship 
between NMUPO and heroin initiation were chosen for analysis based on the extant 
literature (22, 28, 33–36). Demographic and clinical characteristics were ascertained from 
the baseline survey data and included age, sex, race, marital status, and gross annual income. 
HIV status was identified using VA Immunology Case Registry and hepatitis C virus status 
was determined using ICD-9 codes and laboratory data. Previous posttraumatic stress

 disorder (PTSD) and depression diagnoses were ascertained from the following questions: 
“has the doctor ever told you that you have PTSD?” and “has the doctor ever told you that 
you have depression?” Pain interference in daily life was ascertained from responses to the 
following time-updated survey item: “During the past 4 weeks, how much did pain interfere 
with your normal work (including both work outside the home and housework) (37)?” The 
response options for this question included a scale from “not at all” to “extremely”, which 
we dichotomized into “no interference” (“not at all”) and “any interference” (any other 
response). Past-year use of marijuana, cocaine and methamphetamines was dichotomized as 
yes/no. Alcohol use was characterized using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test 
(AUDIT); a score of 4 and above indicated unhealthy alcohol use for men, and a threshold of 
3 for women (38). Responses to questions regarding substance use (including marijuana, 
cocaine, and methamphetamines), unhealthy alcohol use, prior PTSD and depression 
diagnoses, and pain interference in daily life were updated at each survey and were 
considered time-dependent covariates. Consistent with prior methods, receipt of outpatient 
prescribed opioids from the VHA was ascertained from linked pharmacy records, and long-
term prescription opioid use was defined as ≥90 days of continuous use allowing for a 30 
day gap between fill and refill (27, 29, 39). We created a time-updated variable for past year 
receipt of prescription opioids for each wave of data, and categorized it into “none”, “short-
term”, and “long-term”.
Statistical analyses
First, we used chi-square tests to examine the baseline correlates of heroin initiation. 
Additionally, in a post hoc analysis, we examined interaction terms between NMUPO and 
race. Next, unadjusted Kaplan–Meier analysis and the log-rank test were used to calculate 
the incidence of heroin initiation and compare time to heroin use, stratifying by prior or 
concurrent NMUPO.
To analyze the factors associated with heroin initiation, we used Cox proportional hazards 
regression to estimate crude hazard ratios (CHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for 
each variable. To determine the independent relationship between new onset NMUPO and 
heroin initiation, we then constructed a multivariable Cox model, including all variables 
assessed in bivariable analyses. All variables were found to meet the proportional hazards 
assumption for the Cox regression models (i.e., none exhibited significant deviance from this 
assumption at p < 0.05) (40).
We created inverse probability of censoring weights (IPCWs) to account for potential biases 
arising from differential dropout (41). The use of IPCW re-weights the sample such that the 
contribution of participants who remain in the study, but who share characteristics of those 
who dropout, are inflated (42). Weights were obtained through fitting a weighted pooled 
logistic regression model for dropout, including baseline and time varying predictors of 
dropping out. We included a robust sandwich estimator in all Cox regression models to 
account for potential clustering heterogeneity by study site (43). Analyses were conducted 
using SAS version 9.4.

 Sensitivity analysis
In order to assess the validity of our exclusion criteria and ensure to our sample was 
restricted to heroin naïve participants, we re-ran the adjusted Cox regression model 
excluding those participants who were HCV positive at baseline (n = 701), under the 
assumption that the majority could have contracted HCV via injecting.
RESULTS
Sample Composition
The baseline demographic, clinical and substance use characteristics of the 3,396 eligible 
VACS participants are described in Table 1. The mean age was 49.7 (SD = 10.6), 2,106 
(62.5%) were Black, and 327 (9.7%) were Hispanic. Approximately 1500 participants (45%) 
were HIV-infected. At baseline, 102 (3.8%) participants had a past year opioid prescription 
from the VHA. Table 1 describes the characteristics of participants who reported new onset 
NMUPO during the study. Past year stimulant and past year cocaine use were significantly 
associated with NMUPO in our study sample (p < 0.05). However, receipt of a prescription 
opioid from the VHA was not significantly associated with NMUPO. There were no 
substantial differences between the distribution of baseline characteristics among those 
participants who did not complete at least one follow-up visit or were missing exposure data 
and those participants who were eligible for our study (see Table S1, Supplementary File).
The mean proportion of participants who initiated or continued non-medical use of 
prescription opioids across all follow-up waves after baseline was 6.9%. There was no clear 
secular trend in the proportion of participants who reported NMUPO over time (Mantel-
Haenszel test for trend p = 0.208).
Risk Factors for Heroin Initiation
Of the total sample, 500 (14.7%) participants initiated heroin use over the 10-year study 
period. Being black, male, 43–49 years of age, less educated, and having a lower income 
were significantly associated with heroin initiation (all p<0.001). Marijuana, cocaine, 
stimulant, and unhealthy alcohol use in the past year were significantly associated with 
heroin initiation. (all p<0.05, see Table 2).
Figure 2 illustrates the Kaplan Meier curves for time to heroin initiation, which differed 
significantly between participants who reported prior/concurrent NMUPO and non-users; 
the log-rank test was significant at p<0.001. Of the 500 heroin initiates, 77% reported 
previous or concurrent NMUPO (p<0.001). The crude incidence rate for heroin initiation in 
our entire study sample was 2.60 per 100 person years, while the crude incidence rate for 
heroin was 4.82 per 100 person years among those reporting NMUPO and 1.02 per 100 
person years among non-users, respectively (p < 0.001). Of the participants who reported 
new onset NMUPO, 27.3% initiated heroin by the end of the 10-year study period. Figure S1 
(see Supplemental File) depicts the proportion initiating heroin use among participants who 
engaged in NMUPO at each time point.

 The results from both the unadjusted and adjusted Cox regression models using IPCW are 
shown in Table 3. The crude hazard for heroin initiation was significantly higher for males 
than for females and the crude hazards for black and Hispanic participants were significantly 
higher than for white participants. Those participants with a previous PTSD or depression 
diagnoses had a significantly higher hazard of heroin initiation, when compared to those 
without these diagnoses. The crude hazard ratios of heroin initiation among past year 
marijuana, stimulant and cocaine users were also significantly higher, than those participants 
who reported no use. For participants reporting concurrent or prior NMUPO versus none, 
the crude hazard ratio was 5.15 (95%CI: 3.89–6.81).
In the multivariable Cox regression analysis, NMUPO remained positively and significantly 
associated with heroin initiation (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] = 5.43, 95%CI: 4.01–7.35). In 
the fully adjusted and weighted model, those who reported stimulant use and cocaine use in 
the last year had AHRs of 2.12 (95%CI: 1.05–4.27) and 1.74 (95%CI: 1.10–2.76), 
respectively, compared to those participants who reported no past-year use. Receipt of a 
short-term opioid prescription from the VHA increased the hazard of heroin initiation by 
65% (AHR = 1.65, 95%CI: 1.43–1.94) in our fully adjusted model. Other factors 
independently associated with heroin initiation are shown in Table 3. In post hoc analyses, 
the effect of NMUPO on heroin initiation varied significantly by race: (AHR = 5.46, 95%CI 
3.72–8.02) for black participants, (AHR=7.67, 95%CI 4.23–13.88) for Hispanic participants, 
and (AHR=4.89, 95%CI 2.52–9.37) for white participants.
Sensitivity Analysis
After removing the 701 (20.6%) HCV-infected participants, the association between 
NMUPO and heroin initiation remained similar to that in the original model. Specifically, 
NMUPO had an AHR of 6.21 (95%CI: 4.54–8.51).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we characterized the relationship between new onset NMUPO and heroin 
initiation in a population of US military veterans receiving medical care in the VHA. Our 
results indicate a strong association between prior or concurrent NMUPO and initiation of 
heroin use. The observed effect was robust to covariate adjustment and a sensitivity analysis. 
To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate an effect of NMUPO on risk for 
heroin initiation prospectively among veterans receiving medical care.
Given these findings, it is important for clinicians to be cognizant of risk factors that are 
associated with transitioning to heroin initiation among veterans and other high-risk 
populations. Our results, corroborated by other literature (12, 44, 45), indicate that being a 
racial minority, having lower education and income levels, and reporting other substance use 
(particularly cocaine, stimulant and alcohol use) are all associated with heroin initiation. 
HIV and HCV infection were both predictors of heroin initiation in our fully adjusted model. 
This is cause for concern, as the transmission of infectious diseases may result as a result of 
initiation of injection of heroin or prescription opioids (46). Finally, the differences in the 
effect of NMUPO on heroin initiation between black, white, and Hispanic participants may 
be due to disparities in access to appropriate pain management, and/or reduced access to

 opioid prescriptions among minorities (47). Future research is needed to further explore the 
role of reduced access to prescription opioids as a risk factor for heroin initiation in minority 
populations.
Our study suggests that the identification and treatment of nonmedical prescription opioid 
use in a veteran population could be an important strategy for preventing heroin initiation. 
Guidelines, including those developed by the Department of Veterans Affairs and 
Department of Defense, recommend that prescribers of long-term opioids regularly reassess 
treatment effectiveness, adverse effects, and adherence to therapy; monitor for evidence of 
opioid misuse or substance abuse; and consider written treatment agreements and periodic 
urine drug testing (48). It is important that continued attention be given to the development 
and refinement of screening procedures to identify problematic prescription opioid use 
among veterans receiving care.
Our study eligibility criteria resulted in the exclusion of a number of participants with opioid 
prescriptions from the VHA. For example, participants who reported any injection drug use 
and participants who had a previous diagnosis of an opioid dependence at baseline were 
excluded, both of which are factors associated with prescription opioid receipt in the VACS 
sample (39). For this reason, the proportion of the study sample who received an opioid 
prescription may be lower than the prevalence of opioid prescriptions in other VA 
populations, which averaged about 7.7%, with a range of 0.26 to 21.8% in 2012 (49).
Nonetheless, the finding that receipt of a short-term opioid prescription was independently 
associated with an increased hazard of heroin initiation adds to the literature demonstrating a 
strong correlation between therapeutic exposure to opioid analgesics and their abuse.(50) 
Collectively, these results supported recently published CDC guidelines recommending that, 
when opioids are used to treat acute pain, physicians should prescribe no greater quantity 
that needed for the expected duration of the severe pain.(51) These strategies may also 
reduce the total volume of diverted opioids for non-medical use. Finally, our findings 
suggest that clinicians should evaluate risk factors for heroin initiation (e.g., history of a 
substance use disorder) prior to initiating opioid therapy. The potential to reduce NMUPO 
and subsequent opioid use disorders and heroin use by reducing the prescribing of opioids is 
an especially important consideration for those countries where opioid prescribing is on the 
rise. If the rates of opioid prescribing and NMUPO continue to increase in Europe, future 
regulatory responses may be needed to prevent rates of opioid misuse that are seen in North 
America (52).
Our study had a number of limitations. First, our results may not be generalizable to all 
veterans receiving care in the VHA. Due to its design, the study enrolled individuals who are 
likely at higher risk for heroin initiation than the general veteran population (e.g., those with 
HIV and/or HCV infection). Notably, the rate of heroin initiation observed in this study, 
even among those non-exposed to NMUPO (1.0 per 100 person-years) is higher than the rate 
observed among US adults (0.11 per 100 person-years in 2011).(15) Future work is needed 
to examine the rate of heroin use and initiation among lower-risk populations of veterans and 
veterans not receiving care in the VHA. Another major limitation of this study was the fact 
that there were different versions of the survey question assessing nonmedical use of

 prescription opioid use. To mitigate potential information bias arising from the fact that 
participants may have misunderstood the question in the first two versions of the survey (as 
referring to medical use of prescription opioids), we adjusted for receipt of an opioid 
prescription in all analyses. Third, as with any survey questions reporting on substance use 
behaviors, it is likely that participants underreported their previous heroin and NMUPO. We 
attempted to address this issue by excluding participants who reported previous injection 
drug use and those with an ICD9 code for opioid dependence, as well as running sensitivity 
analyses excluding participants with hepatitis C. Additionally, we were only able to ascertain 
new onset NMUPO concurrent or prior to heroin initiation. Finally, differential loss to 
follow up was a potential source of bias in this study. This was addressed by using inverse 
probability of censoring weights to account for possible biases arising from differential loss 
to follow-up.
Despite these limitations, our study fills an important gap in the literature by comparing the 
demographic, clinical and substance use characteristics associated with heroin initiation 
among US veterans receiving medical care in the VHA. Identifying why particular veterans 
engage in NMUPO, and why a portion of them then transition to heroin initiation, are 
possible next steps in developing effective NMUPO screening strategies. For example, 
previous studies involving college students have found that the single leading reason for 
nonmedical use was to relieve pain (53–56). However, in our final model, pain interference 
in daily life was not a significant predictor of heroin initiation. Given that the experiences 
and the demographics of a veteran population are substantially different from young college 
students, further research needs to be conducted in order to elucidate motivations for 
NMUPO among veterans who receive medical care in the VHA. In sum, recognizing that 
NMUPO is a strong risk factor for heroin initiation suggests the urgent need for improved 
screening and assessment.
