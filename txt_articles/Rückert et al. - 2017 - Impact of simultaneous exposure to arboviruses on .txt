The recent emergence of both chikungunya and Zika viruses in the Americas has significantly
expanded their distribution and has thus increased the possibility that individuals may
become infected by more than one Aedes aegypti-borne virus at a time. Recent clinical data
support an increase in the frequency of coinfection in human patients, raising the likelihood
that mosquitoes could be exposed to multiple arboviruses during one feeding episode. The
impact of coinfection on the ability of relevant vector species to transmit any of these viruses
(that is, their vector competence) has not been determined. Thus, we here expose Ae. aegypti
mosquitoes to chikungunya, dengue-2 or Zika viruses, both individually and as double
and triple infections. Our results show that these mosquitoes can be infected with and
can transmit all combinations of these viruses simultaneously. Importantly, infection,
dissemination and transmission rates in mosquitoes are only mildly affected by coinfection.

hikungunya (CHIKV; genus Alphavirus), dengue (DENV;
genus Flavivirus) and Zika (ZIKV; genus Flavivirus)
viruses are mainly transmitted to humans by Aedes
aegypti mosquitoes. As a result, their geographic distributions
largely overlap (Fig. 1). As these agents continue to emerge into
new regions1–3, the likelihood of coinfection by multiple
Ae. aegypti-borne viruses may be increasing. Importantly, the
frequency
of
coinfection
in
nature
and
its
clinical
and
epidemiologic implications are poorly understood. The first
report of CHIKV and DENV-2 coinfection occurred in 1967
(ref. 4). More recently, coinfections have been reported during
various CHIKV/DENV outbreaks, as well as during the recent
outbreak of ZIKV in the Americas5–9. A relatively high
abundance of CHIKV/DENV-coinfected patients (2–26.3%) was
found
in
a
number
of
studies,
including
outbreaks
in
Madagascar10, Gabon11 and Saint Martin12. Furthermore, in a
2016 clinical study in Nicaragua, 27% of all arbovirus-infected
patients were viremic for multiple agents, including all possible
combinations of CHIKV, DENV and ZIKV5. Overall, these
studies suggest that coinfections may be fairly common in
endemic and epidemic regions.
Coinfected, viremic patients can expose mosquitoes to multiple
viruses at the same time. The ability of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes to
be coinfected and co-transmit arboviruses could have important
implications for the epidemiology and evolution of these viruses.
However,
our
current
understanding
of
coinfection
and
co-transmission by Aedes mosquitoes is limited. Notably, during
an outbreak of CHIKV and DENV-2 in Gabon in 2010,
a CHIKV/DENV-2 coinfected Aedes albopictus mosquito was
collected around houses of coinfected patients11. One laboratory
study
suggested
that
Ae.
aegypti
may
be
refractory
to
CHIKV/DENV coinfection13, but two others have reported the
ability of Aedes mosquitoes to be CHIKV/DENV coinfected and
to expectorate both viruses in their saliva14,15. Due to a relatively
small sample size it was not possible to determine what effect
coinfection may have on vector competence. It is not clear
whether coinfection with multiple viruses could result in
interspecific competition and interference during various stages
of infection, or whether infection with one virus could enhance
transmission of another. There are several molecular mechanisms
supporting the notion that coinfection may influence vector
competence. For example, mosquito antiviral responses such as
RNA interference (RNAi), among others16,17, could be activated
or suppressed by one of the coinfecting viruses and could thereby
indirectly affect replication of another virus. Mechanisms for
RNAi suppression in flaviviruses include subgenomic flavivirus
RNA18,19 and an RNAi suppressor function of NS4B (ref. 20). In
addition, flavivirus NS1 has recently been shown to be important
for initial midgut infection by suppression of immune-related
gene expression21. Consequently, NS1 may not only enhance
flavivirus infection but it may also enhance midgut infection of a
heterologous virus such as CHIKV. In contrast, CHIKV replicates
and disseminates faster than the two flaviviruses22–25 and may
thus directly outcompete DENV and ZIKV in vivo. Similarly,
exposing mosquitoes to two closely related flaviviruses, DENV
and ZIKV, could directly impact virus infection, dissemination
and transmission through superinfection exclusion26–28 or a
similar mechanism. We thus hypothesized that infection of
mosquitoes with multiple arboviruses would alter the vector
competence for at least one of them.
Accordingly, we sought to determine whether Ae. aegypti
mosquitoes are capable of transmitting CHIKV, DENV-2 and
ZIKV simultaneously as combinations of two or all three viruses.
We also sought to quantify how exposure to more than one
arbovirus may affect vector competence for the individual viruses.
In particular, mosquitoes were exposed to CHIKV, DENV-2 and
ZIKV individually, in pairs, and in a triple-infected bloodmeal,
and vector competence and virus replication was assessed after 3,
7 and 14 days incubation in mosquitoes. We found that
coinfection and co-transmission of all virus pairs by Ae. aegypti
was possible and occurred frequently. After triple exposure to
CHIKV/DENV-2/ZIKV, nearly all mosquitoes became infected
by all three viruses, and some of these mosquitoes secreted
infectious
CHIKV,
DENV-2 and
ZIKV with their saliva.
Collectively, our results indicate that Ae. aegypti are capable of
co-transmitting all virus pairs as well as the three viruses together,
and that coinfection minimally impacts vector competence.
Results
Ae. aegypti mosquitoes are susceptible to coinfection. To
maximize infection of mosquitoes and more closely model nat-
ural transmission, virus was propagated freshly for each experi-
ment to avoid freeze-thaw and clinically relevant titres were
used29,30. To estimate virus titres at the time of infection, virus
growth curves on Vero cells were established for all three viruses
used in this study: CHIKV (strain 99659)31, DENV-2 (strain
Merida)32 and ZIKV (strain PRVABC59)33. Viral genome
equivalents (GEs) per ml were determined by quantitative
reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) (Fig. 2a), and viral plaque
forming units (PFU) were determined by plaque assay (Fig. 2b).
From these data, the GE/PFU ratio for each time point was
determined (Fig. 2c). Peak titres with the lowest GE/PFU ratio
were chosen for the collection of fresh virus for experimental
infection of mosquitoes (1, 5 and 4 days for CHIKV, DENV-2
and
ZIKV,
respectively).
The
workflow
for
experimental
infections/coinfections is shown in Fig. 2d.
We first determined infection rates for mosquitoes exposed to
the three viruses individually or in combination. Bloodmeal titres
from fresh virus varied between experiments (Table 1) and
ranged from 3 � 103 to 1.4 � 106 PFU per ml, representative of
clinical viremia5,30. The overall per cent of mosquitoes that
became infected after exposure to single viruses were 87, 81 and
48 for CHIKV, DENV-2 and ZIKV, respectively. At low
bloodmeal titres (r2.2 � 105 PFU per ml) ZIKV infection rates
dropped as low as 5%. We then compared infection rates in
singly exposed mosquitoes to those mosquitoes co-exposed
to another arbovirus. When mosquitoes were co-exposed to
CHIKV/DENV-2, CHIKV and DENV-2 infection rates were not
significantly different compared to infection rates after CHIKV or
DENV-2 single exposure (Fig. 3a). However, after ZIKV/CHIKV
co-exposure, ZIKV infection rates were reduced by 11.3%
(P ¼ 0.0473, Fisher’s exact test) compared to ZIKV single
exposure
(Fig.
3b),
while
CHIKV
infection
rates
were
unaffected by ZIKV co-exposure. Finally, neither DENV-2
nor
ZIKV
infection
rates
were
significantly
affected
by
DENV-2/ZIKV
co-exposure
compared
to
single
exposure
(Fig. 3c). High proportions of coinfection with both viruses
were observed after co-exposure with all three virus pairings
(Fig. 3a–c).
Dissemination and transmission during coinfection. Once a
mosquito is infected, the virus disseminates through the mosquito
body and replicates in the salivary gland before reaching the
saliva to be transmitted. To determine whether coinfection affects
virus dissemination and transmission, we assessed infection
in mosquito legs and salivary secretions collected at all time
points among singly infected and coinfected mosquitoes (Fig. 4).
Dissemination rates were not significantly affected by coinfection
in any of the combinations tested (Fig. 4a,c,e), with the exception
of DENV-2 dissemination which was reduced (P ¼ 0.0149,
Fisher’s exact test) at 7 days post infection (d.p.i.) with

 CHIKV/DENV-2 compared to DENV-2 alone (Fig. 4c). DENV-2
transmission rates remained unaffected by CHIKV or ZIKV
coinfection (Fig. 4d), and CHIKV/ZIKV coinfection did not affect
transmission rates of either virus (Fig. 4b,f). However, CHIKV
transmission rates were significantly reduced (P ¼ 0.0004, Fisher’s
exact test) 14 d.p.i. in DENV-2 coinfected mosquitoes by 27%
compared to mosquitoes that were only exposed to CHIKV
(Fig. 4b).
Overall, we identified 14, 11 and seven mosquitoes with a
co-transmission potential for CHIKV/DENV-2, CHIKV/ZIKV
and DENV-2/ZIKV, respectively (Table 2). One saliva sample
was positive for CHIKV and ZIKV as early as 3 d.p.i. which
corresponded with high virus replication for CHIKV (1.2 � 108
RNA copies per sample) and ZIKV (2.5 � 107 RNA copies per
sample) detected in the legs of the same mosquito compared
to other leg samples at 3 d.p.i. (Supplementary Fig. 2a,g).
The proportion of co-transmitting mosquitoes was close to, but
generally slightly above, expected values given the proportions of
mosquitoes that transmit each virus individually (Table 2).
Saliva samples positive for two viruses were further screened for
infectious virus by inoculation of Vero and/or A549 cells and
subsequent measurement of viral GE in the supernatant over time

 (Supplementary Table 1). Selected single positive samples and
negative saliva samples were included as controls. We identified
seven,
six
and
five
saliva
samples
containing
infectious
CHIKV/DENV-2, CHIKV/ZIKV and DENV-2/ZIKV, respec-
tively, including the CHIKV/ZIKV positive saliva sample from
3 d.p.i. In total, 28 out of 37 selected samples that were RT-PCR
positive for one virus tested positive for infectious virus, and all
RT-PCR-negative samples were negative for infectious virus.
Viral load in saliva of single and dual infected mosquitoes. To
assess the impact of coinfection on virus replication dynamics
within mosquitoes, we compared viral GEs in the different tissues
of single infected and coinfected mosquitoes. We found a number
of small but statistically significant changes in GE in legs
and bodies during coinfection/co-exposure compared to single
exposure (Supplementary Figs 2 and 3). However, none of these
effects were greater than threefold and are not reflected in
changes in dissemination or transmission. Importantly, the viral
load in saliva was comparable in singly infected, co-exposed and
co-transmitting mosquitoes for all viruses both at 7 d.p.i.
(Fig. 5a,c,e) and 14 d.p.i. (Fig. 5b,d,f). The geometric mean RNA
load in single infections at 7 d.p.i. was 5.0 � 103 GE per saliva
sample for CHIKV (Fig. 5a), 3.0 � 103 GE per saliva sample for
DENV-2 (Fig. 5c) and 1.3 � 103 GE per saliva sample for ZIKV
(Fig. 5e). At 14 d.p.i. the geometric means were 5.3 � 103 GE per
saliva sample for CHIKV (Fig. 5b), 8.2 � 103 GE per saliva sample
for DENV-2 (Fig. 5d) and 3.5 � 103 GE per saliva sample for
ZIKV (Fig. 5f). No significant differences were observed between
GE in saliva samples from single exposed, dual exposed or
co-transmitting mosquitoes.
Ae. aegypti can transmit all three viruses simultaneously.
Finally, we exposed 48 mosquitoes to all three viruses and col-
lected legs, saliva and bodies at 14 and 21 days post exposure
(d.p.e.) and screened them for viral RNA. In total, 92% of mos-
quitoes were infected with all three viruses at both time points
combined (Table 3). One mosquito was uninfected and seven
mosquitoes were positive only for CHIKV and ZIKV. All but one
triple-infected mosquito had established a disseminated infection
at 14 d.p.e.; all had a disseminated infection at 21 d.p.e. Six saliva
samples were PCR positive for all three viruses at 14 d.p.e. and
two at 21 d.p.e. In addition, seven saliva samples were positive for
two of the three viruses. Saliva samples which tested PCR positive
for more than one virus were screened for infectious virus by
inoculation of Vero cells and/or A549 cells (Supplementary
Table 1). All three viruses were infectious to Vero and/or A549
cells in four out of the six triple positive saliva samples collected
at 14 d.p.e. The other two samples were positive for two viruses
(one CHIKV þ ZIKV and one DENV-2 þ ZIKV). Out of the two
21 d.p.e. triple positive samples, one was positive for ZIKV and
the other for DENV-2 and ZIKV.
The triple infection was not performed in parallel to the
dual/single infections and may thus not allow for an in-depth
comparison (due to variability in bloodmeal titres). It is still
noteworthy that the overall CHIKV transmission rate at 14 d.p.i. was
26% lower (P¼ 0.0016, Fisher’s exact test) than in singly infected
mosquitoes, which is comparable to the reduction in CHIKV
transmission after CHIKV/DENV-2 coinfection. However, the
geometric mean of CHIKV RNA (2.2� 104 GE per saliva) in these
samples was fourfold higher compared to CHIKV singly infected
mosquitoes (5.3� 103 GE per saliva). Viral loads of DENV-2

 Discussion
Recent field and clinical data have indicated that in nature,
human beings and mosquitoes may be infected by multiple
arboviruses more frequently than has been previously appre-
ciated6–9,29,34. Unfortunately, the extent to which coinfecting
viruses interfere or synergize with one another in vivo is poorly
understood. Therefore, we sought to assess coinfection of
Ae. aegypti mosquitoes with more than one arbovirus. We used
an Ae. aegypti colony of Mexican origin and virus isolates from
the Americas to mimic the current outbreak in the Americas;
however, vector competence for different arboviruses in various
Ae. aegypti populations varies, for example by geographic region,
and our study may not be representative of some other mosquito/
virus combinations. Our results indicate that Ae. aegypti (Poza
Rica) mosquitoes exposed to more than one arbovirus become
coinfected frequently, even at relatively low titres. In addition,
exposure to multiple viruses tended not to affect mosquito
susceptibility: mosquito midgut infection rates for each virus were
similar whether the virus was delivered alone or in combination
with another arbovirus. The reason for this is likely multifactorial.
First, it may be that CHIKV, DENV-2 and ZIKV target different
cells (or subcellular compartments) within the mosquito midgut.

 Alternatively (or possibly in addition), it may be that only a small
number of cells are initially infected in the midgut35, rendering
enhancement and/or superinfection exclusion during coinfection
largely irrelevant. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether
superinfection exclusion even occurs between these viruses
since the literature is somewhat contradictory26–28. In general,
our results allow us to conclude that in most cases arbovirus
infection of mosquito midguts is not altered by the presence of
coinfecting arboviruses. However, we observed one case where
co-exposure appeared to minimally impact infection of mosquito
midguts. CHIKV/ZIKV co-exposure resulted in decreased ZIKV
infection in mosquitoes. While the reduction was statistically
significant, it was not dramatic (11.3%). The mechanisms that
produced this small effect are unclear at present, but may be
related to direct competition. Overall, these data suggest that
there is likely little interaction between multiple arboviruses
during the establishment of infection in Ae. aegypti.
Following infection of mosquito midguts, arboviruses must
disseminate from the midgut and ultimately infect salivary glands
and be released into mosquito salivary secretions. Modulated
immune responses or direct virus competition for resources
may suppress or enhance virus replication and dissemination
during coinfection. However, we found that dissemination and
transmission
rates
were
similar
in
single
and
coinfected
mosquitoes. Only CHIKV/DENV-2 coinfection resulted in any
changes in dissemination and transmission dynamics, and these
changes were small. While CHIKV co-exposure significantly
reduced DENV-2 dissemination at 7 d.p.i., transmission rates
were not significantly reduced and no difference was observed at
14 d.p.i. Moreover, DENV-2 coinfection significantly reduced
CHIKV transmission at 14 d.p.i. by 27%. Notably, this was the
biggest effect that coinfection had on vector competence for any
of the viruses. Yet taken altogether, these findings indicate how
little coinfection affects vector competence and that, for the most
part, there appear to be sufficient resources in the mosquito
for multiple viruses to replicate systemically. In fact, when we
used single transmission proportions to predict how likely
co-transmission is, we found that the proportion of mosquitoes
that were co-transmitting was either close to the predicted
proportion or in some cases higher. This increase was probably
related to an overlap in high/low vector competence in individual
mosquitoes for these viruses; for example, a mosquito more
competent for DENV-2 may also be more competent for ZIKV
resulting in co-transmission proportions higher than random
probability.
In
addition
to
the
co-transmission
numbers,
viral
GE
expectorated with saliva were not significantly different in
co-exposed or co-transmitting mosquitoes compared to single
infections, suggesting that the transmission potential of single
versus dual transmitting mosquitoes is comparable. Selected
saliva samples were also infectious for more than one virus. While
we were not able to detect infectious virus in all PCR-positive
saliva samples, this was not unexpected due to different
sensitivities of various assays and differences in specimen content
and handling. Moreover, our results clearly establish that
Ae. aegypti mosquitoes have the capability to transmit more than
one virus during a single feeding episode.
Finally, triple infection with and transmission of CHIKV,
DENV-2 and ZIKV was confirmed. Triple infection rates were
high and co-transmission rates were comparable to single
transmission rates of DENV-2 and ZIKV, but lower for CHIKV.
The impact of our observed increase in CHIKV and ZIKV GE in
triple positive saliva on transmission to naı
¨ve hosts is currently
unclear. While exposure to the three viruses simultaneously is
likely to be an extremely rare occurrence, these results support the
overall conclusion from much of the work reported here, that
multiple arboviruses can be transmitted by a single mosquito
during a single feeding episode.
The implications of co-exposure and co-transmission on the
epidemiology, pathogenesis and evolution of these agents remains
unclear. Due to limited clinical information and, most likely,
underdiagnosis of coinfections, the extent of coinfections in
human beings and mosquitoes under natural conditions is poorly
defined. Thus, future work will be aimed at understanding the
effect of coinfection on pathogenesis in mammals. However,
coinfection may also play an important role in virus evolution,
both in the mammalian host and mosquito vector. Beyond the
possibility that increased or generally altered immune pressures
may drive virus evolution during coinfection, it is unclear
whether different viruses may replicate within the same cells
allowing for recombination events. We thus need to improve our
understanding of where in the mosquito these viruses replicate
during coinfection compared to single infection and how
coinfection affects virus evolution in the mosquito and the
mammalian host. Another important question is how coinfection
and co-transmission rates may differ when mosquitoes are
exposed to multiple viruses at different stages of their adult
life—in the present study we expose mosquitoes to virus with
their first bloodmeal, but we do not know how mosquito age or
previous bloodmeals may affect vector competence during
coinfection. Furthermore, sequential exposure to multiple viruses
will be another aim of future studies and may have a more
pronounced effect on vector competence. However, if coinfection
and co-transmission after sequential exposure is also common, it
could further increase the number of co-transmitting mosquitoes
and the risk of coinfection. In conclusion, this study provides
clear evidence that CHIKV, DENV-2 and ZIKV may be
co-transmitted by mosquitoes following simultaneous exposure.
The impact of coinfection on the biology of the agents and
human health are high priorities for future work.

 gentamycin at 37 �C with 5% CO2. A549 cells (ATCC CCL-185; kindly provided
by Dr Nisha Duggal, CDC, Fort Collins) were maintained in DMEM 10% FBS
and 50 mg ml � 1 gentamycin at 37 �C with 5% CO2. Cells tested negative for
mycoplasma/bacterial contamination by DAPI stain and fluorescence microscopy
analysis.
Mosquitoes. Ae. aegypti (Stegomyia) colonies (F12–14) established from wild
populations in Poza Rica, Mexico36, were used for vector competence studies.
For colony maintenance, mosquitoes were fed citrated sheep blood and given
sugar and water ad libitum. Larvae were reared and adults maintained under
controlled conditions of temperature (28 �C), humidity (70% RH) and light
(12:12L:D diurnal cycle).
Viruses. American isolates of CHIKV (R99659; British Virgin Islands; GenBank
#KJ451624), DENV-2 (BC-17; Merida, Mexico, GenBank #AY449677) and ZIKV
(PRVABC59; Puerto Rico; GenBank #KU501215) were obtained from the Center
for Disease Control and Prevention branch in Fort Collins, CO (CHIKV and
ZIKV) and Dr William Black IV (DENV-2). All three viruses were propagated in
Vero cells by infection at multiplicity of infection (MOI) 0.01 to generate virus
stocks which were stored in aliquots at � 80 �C. Virus titres (PFU per ml) were
quantified using Vero cells and a standard plaque assay protocol.
Multiplex qRT-PCR. To screen for the three viruses in one sample, a multiplex
qRT-PCR assay was established. Previously published primers and probes were
used for CHIKV (modified from Grubaugh et al.37) and ZIKV (Lanciotti et al.38). A
new set of primers and probe were designed for DENV-2. All primers are listed in
Supplementary Table 2. T7 RNA standards were generated for each PCR using
primers as listed in Supplementary Table 2 for CHIKV and DENV-2. For ZIKV
standards, RNA was produced from a full-length infectious clone as described
previously39. Sensitivity and efficiency were highly comparable between single and
multiplex assays using the selected primer sets, and no cross-reactivity was
observed (Supplementary Fig. 4). When the assay was used to determine positivity
of mosquito samples, a conservative Ct value cutoff of 36.5 was used, roughly
corresponding to ten RNA copies. RNA from unexposed mosquitoes never
amplified above that threshold for any of the three viruses.
In vitro experiments. Growth curves were established to determine peak of virus
production. For this, five replicate wells of a six-well plate were infected at MOI 0.1
with CHIKV, DENV or ZIKV. At each time point, 200 ml supernatant was taken,
centrifuged at 3,000g for 5 min and supernatant was transferred to a new tube.
An aliquot of 50 ml was taken and treated with RNaseA (final 200 mg ml � 1) for
30 min at 37 �C to digest free RNA in the cell supernatant. The samples were
immediately lysed in TNA lysis buffer (Omega) and frozen at � 20 �C. RNA
was extracted from the RNaseA-treated supernatant using the Mag-Bind Viral
DNA/RNA 96 kit (Omega Bio-Tek) on the KingFisher Flex Magnetic Particle
Processor (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA was eluted in 50 ml nuclease-free water.
Genome equivalents per ml were determined by qRT-PCR using primers and
probes also used for multiplex qRT-PCR as described above (Supplementary
Table 2). Virus titres (PFU per ml) were determined by plaque assay using the
remaining supernatant from each sample. Growth curves were stopped when
450% of the cells in a culture were dead.
Coinfection of Aedes aegypti. Four- to seven-day-old Ae. aegypti were orally
exposed to blood containing the three viruses individually or in combination using
a water-jacketed glass feeder and hog-gut as a membrane. The infectious bloodmeal
contained 50% defibrinated calf blood, 10% FBS and 40% DMEM containing
freshly propagated virus stocks to result in an estimated titre of 106 PFU per ml of
blood (of each virus in dual or triple infections). CHIKV, DENV-2 and ZIKV were
grown on Vero cells for 1, 5 and 4 days, respectively. The mean GE/PFU ratio
determined at the selected time points (CHIKV ¼ 4,308; DENV2 ¼ 867;
ZIKV ¼ 445) was used to estimate titres of fresh virus stocks prior to mosquito
bloodmeal. Stock titres were subsequently confirmed by plaque assay (Table 1) and
were in the majority of infections lower than 1 � 106 PFU per ml. Groups of 40
mosquitoes were fed for each time point and condition wherever possible. Due to
variable availability of female mosquitoes taking an infectious bloodmeal, five
experiments were performed to result in at least two replicate experiments per
condition and time point (Table 1). All mosquito infections were performed under
BSL3 conditions. Mosquitoes were dissected at 3, 7 and 14 days to collect bodies,
legs and saliva to determine infection, dissemination and transmission rates,
respectively. Samples were screened by qRT-PCR for viral RNA. Selected saliva
samples were also used to inoculate Vero and/or A549 cells to determine the
presence of infectious virus in saliva samples.
Mosquito dissections and sample processing. Dissections and sample
processing were performed as described previously23. Briefly, at the selected time
points post-infectious bloodmeal, mosquitoes were cold-anaesthetized and legs and
wings were dissected into a 2 ml tube containing 250 ml mosquito diluent (1 � PBS
supplemented with 20% FBS, 50 mg ml � 1 Penicillin/Streptomycin, 50 mg ml � 1
Gentamycin and 2.5 mg ml � 1 Fungizone) and a stainless steel bead. The
mosquitoes’ proboscis was then placed into a capillary tube filled with immersion
oil for 20 min to salivate. Bodies were then also placed into a 2 ml tube containing
200 ml diluent and a stainless steel bead. The end of the capillary tubes containing
saliva were broken off into 100 ml diluent and centrifuged at 15,000g for 5 min.
Mosquito tissues (legs/wings and bodies) were homogenized using a Retsch Mixer
Mill MM400 (Germany) at 25 cycles per second for 1 min and centrifuged at
15,000g for 5 min at 4 �C. After homogenization and centrifugation, 50 ml of each
sample was transferred into TNA lysis buffer (Omega) and the remaining sample
volume was frozen at � 80 �C. RNA was extracted from the lysed sample using the
Mag-Bind Viral DNA/RNA 96 kit (Omega Bio-Tek) on the KingFisher Flex
Magnetic Particle Processor (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples positive for viral
RNA were identified by multiplex qRT-PCR.
Confirmation of infectious virus in saliva. For selected samples including those
which were positive for more than one virus, 10 ml of saliva was used to infect Vero
cells in a 24-well format. Supernatant was taken at 0 h as well as 48 h, 72 h and/or
120 h post infection. An increase in viral RNA over time was used to identify
samples containing infectious virus. In some samples CHIKV was highly abundant
and resulted in 450% cytopathic effect at 48 hours post infection (h.p.i.), making it
difficult to determine the presence of infectious DENV-2 or ZIKV which replicate
slower. These samples were also used to infect A549 cells which are resistant to
CHIKV infection40, but susceptible to DENV-2 (ref. 41) and ZIKV42.
Statistical analysis. A two-tailed Fisher’s exact test was used to compare rates of
infection, dissemination and transmission in vector competence studies. One-way
ANOVA with multiple comparisons was used to compare GEs in saliva samples.
GraphPad Prism 6.0 (La Jolla, CA) was used for statistical tests and significance was
defined as Po0.05.
