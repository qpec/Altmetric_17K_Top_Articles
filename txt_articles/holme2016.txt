mortality:
40-year
follow-up
of
the

J Intern Med 2016; 280: 221–227.
Background. The effects of saturated fat on atheroscle-
rotic vascular disease are currently debated.
Objectives. In the Oslo cardiovascular study initiated
in 1972/1973, a 5-year randomized intervention
was conducted in healthy middle-aged men at high
risk of coronary heart disease to compare the
effects on coronary heart disease incidence of diet
and antismoking advice versus control (no inter-
vention). A significant reduction (47%) in first
myocardial infarction incidence was observed. We
have followed mortality up to 40 years to establish
whether a lifelong benefit on mortality risk of
myocardial infarction could be observed.
Methods. In the present study, a total of 16 203 men
(63% of those invited), aged 40–49 years, partici-
pated in a screening examination. Overall, 1232
men with total serum cholesterol levels of 6.9–
8.9 mmol L�1 (80% smokers) were included in the
study. The dietary intervention consisted of mainly
decreasing
the
intake
of
saturated
fats
and
increasing fish and vegetable products, as well as
weight reduction in overweight subjects. Smokers
were advised to stop smoking. Cox regression
analysis was used for statistical analyses.
Results. The intervention group showed a sustained
reduced risk of death at first myocardial infarction
(hazard ratio 0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.51–
1.00; P = 0.049), compared to control subjects up
to 40 years. During follow-up, the beneficial effect
developed gradually but proportionally up to about
15 years after randomization. Later, the curves
were parallel. All-cause mortality decreased in the
period 8–20 years after randomization, but not
thereafter.
Conclusions. Receiving advice about a healthy lifestyle
led to a long-term reduced risk of coronary mor-
tality during the following 40 years. Our results
suggest
that
systematically
providing
effective
counselling for a healthy lifestyle for 5 years can
lead to lifelong benefits.
Keywords: coronary heart disease, diet, mortality,
prevention, smoking.
Introduction
The role of reducing saturated fat in the diet to
promote health is debated [1, 2]. Interpretation of
results from large prospective cohort studies differs
regarding the association between intake of satu-
rated fat and incidence of cardiovascular disease
[3]. In the field of nutrition, however, very few
randomized
controlled
trials
(RCTs)
have
had
enough statistical power to investigate all-cause
mortality as an outcome. This lack of mortality
data from RCTs has contributed to ambiguity in
the literature. In the present study, we report data
on
all-cause
mortality
and
death
from
acute
myocardial infarction in an RCT initiated 40 years
ago.
During the period 1972–1973, 1232 healthy men
at high risk of coronary heart disease were ran-
domly assigned to intervention or control groups.
Results from this 5-year intervention trial have
previously been reported in detail [4]. The inter-
vention consisted of half-yearly clinical visits with
control and further advice to reduce the amount of
saturated fats in the diet and to increase the intake
of fish products, vegetables and fruit. Overweight

 men were advised to reduce weight and reduce
their intake of sugar. Smokers in the intervention
group were also advised to quit smoking. Men in
the control group were not given any such specific
advice until the end of the 5-year intervention.
Neither the intervention group nor the control
group received advice regarding physical activity.
The purpose of this study was to present results up
to 40 years with respect to death at first myocar-
dial infarction (MI) and all-cause mortality, to
determine whether lifelong benefits were obtained
from
the
original
5-year
intervention.
To
our
knowledge, this is the longest survival observation
in an RCT in this field. This study provides insight
into historical aspects of coronary heart disease
primary prevention.
Methods
All 25 915 men born in Oslo during the period
1923–1932 were invited in 1972/1973 to a cardio-
vascular disease (CVD) screening examination; of
these,
16 203
(63%)
men
participated
in
the
screening. Participants were asked to complete a
questionnaire about prevalent CVD and diabetes.
Men
without
these
diseases
were
considered
healthy and subsequently took part in two exam-
inations to select suitable participants for the
randomized Oslo diet and antismoking study [5].
Men with total serum cholesterol levels of 6.9–
8.9 mmol L�1 were included provided they had a
coronary risk score in the upper quartile of a
distribution based on the classical risk factors
blood pressure, total cholesterol and cigarette
smoking [4]. Men with higher total serum choles-
terol levels (≥9.0 mmol L�1) were referred to a lipid
clinic. After 8.5 years, all surviving men were
recalled for a follow-up examination and the same
measurements as carried out at the final trial
examination were performed in all except 26 men
[6]. At this time-point, all men in the control group
were given the same advice about dietary change
and smoking cessation as given to the men in the
intervention group, as supported by the positive
findings of the trial.
Amongst
survivors
(n = 12 764),
only
47.2%
attended a follow-up examination in the year
2000 (25.8% and 22.3%, respectively, in the active
and control groups) [7].
This study is an extended survey to 31 December
2011,
including
the
complete
cohort
of
all
participants (n = 1232) with respect to mortality
at first MI, established through death certificates,
and total mortality. Men who emigrated were
censored at the date of emigration. Statistics
Norway provided mortality data to the Oslo study
data file through the national unique 11-digit
personal number, following permission from the
Data Inspectorate, tax authorities and Department
of Health. The project was approved by the regional
ethics committee for medical research.
Statistical analysis
Rates per 1000 observation years and differences
between rates with 95% confidence limits were
calculated. Cox proportional hazards regression
models were used; time to death or time to death at
first MI was included as dependent variables, and
group, age, total cholesterol, systolic blood pres-
sure and smoking were exposure factors. Hazard
ratios were calculated with 95% confidence limits.
The log-rank test was used to test for differences
between groups (intervention and control) with
respect to survival. Kaplan–Meier curves were
generated, and mean survival times were esti-
mated, using STATA 13 software (STATA Corp LP).
Results
Table 1 shows the levels of the major CVD risk
factors at screening by group. According to the
inclusion criteria of the study, the prevalence of
smoking and the levels of total serum cholesterol
were high, whereas blood pressure was not raised.
The average age of participants was 45 years.
These
men
were
of
normal
weight
but
had
somewhat elevated levels of nonfasting serum
triglycerides.
The use of antihypertensive medication (45%) and
use of statins (45%) were similar between the
intervention and control groups at follow-up in
the year 2000, as were other risk factors including
total serum cholesterol levels, smoking and the
prevalence of diabetes and CVD (Tables 2 and 3).
At the end of the trial, a total of 19 coronary events
had been reported in the intervention group and 36
in the control group (P = 0.028). The number of
fatal myocardial infarctions or sudden deaths was
six
and
14,
respectively,
in
the
two
groups
(P = 0.086), whereas the total number of all-cause
deaths was 16 and 24, respectively (P = 0.246), as
previously reported [4].

 At 40 years of follow-up, there was a nominally
significant reduction in the risk of death at first MI
in the intervention group versus control (hazard
ratio 0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.51–1.00,
P = 0.049; Fig. 1 and Table 4). After adjusting for
baseline risk factors such as age, total cholesterol,
systolic blood pressure and smoking, the P-value
was slightly lower (0.038). A proportional develop-
ment of risk until about 15 years of follow-up took
place, and thereafter, the curves went parallel.
There was no significant difference in total mortal-
ity at 40 years (Fig. 2); however, there was a
nominally significant reduction in total mortality
at 15 years of follow-up (Fig. 3). The net difference
in number of deaths between the two groups varied
from 12 at 8.5 years to 20 at 40 years of follow-up.
Mean survival time increased by 0.5 years (re-
stricted due to censorship) in the intervention
versus control group and by 0.9 years if an expo-
nential distribution of survival time was modelled
for the remaining lifetime amongst survivors.
Discussion
The intervention was successful in that major
dietary changes were made such as a reduction
in intake of saturated fat from 18.3 to 8.2 energy
percentage
as
measured
in
representative
subgroups,
with
an
average
net
reduction
of
0.8 mmol L�1 (10%) in serum total cholesterol
between groups [4]. The beneficial effects of the
intervention on death at first MI peaked at about
15 years of follow-up, long after the end of the trial.
Thereafter, survival curves in the two groups were
parallel until 71% of the participants had died at
study end, indicating a lifelong benefit of the
intervention. At 15 years, 24 deaths due to CVD

 had occurred in the intervention group and 48 in
the control group (nominal P = 0.004), whilst the
corresponding values for all-cause mortality were
58 and 82 (nominal P = 0.027). Interestingly, the
West
of
Scotland
Coronary
Prevention
Study
(WOSCOPS) researchers reported continued bene-
ficial effects of statin therapy on all-cause mortality
up to 14 years after study end [8, 9]. They specu-
lated that a reduction in serum cholesterol over
6 years may reduce the development of atheroscle-
rosis during that period resulting in clinical benefit
long after the end of the trial. Much of the effect in
our study was probably mediated through the
dietary lowering of serum cholesterol and triglyc-
eride levels and weight reduction, whereas the
effects of smoking cessation were smaller as rela-
tively few men stopped smoking completely in the
two groups (16% and 21% in the control and
intervention groups, respectively). However, smok-
ing reduction by smokers was greater in the
intervention group than in the control group [4]
and, because the 40-year follow-up of the popula-
tion showed a strong dose–response relationship
between amount of cigarette smoking and both MI
and total mortality [10], it is conceivable that the
smoking intervention also played a role in the
continued positive effect on mortality at first MI in
the early years after the end of the intervention.
Based on an extensive statistical analysis con-
ducted at the end of the trial [4], it was estimated
that the changes in smoking explained at most
25% of the difference in MI incidence, whereas the
remaining difference was due to dietary interven-
tion and chance variations. However, there was a
clear dose–response relationship between early
reduction in total serum cholesterol and subse-
quent reduction in risk of MI.
There was an almost complete follow-up of surviv-
ing trial participants at about 8.5 years [6]. This
showed that the number of cigarettes smoked per

 day increased in the intervention group and was
almost equal to that in the control group. The net
difference between groups in total serum choles-
terol was reduced from 0.8 mmol L�1 during the 5-
year trial to about 0.3 mmol L�1 at 8.5 years.
Thus, from the time-point of 8.5 years of follow-
up and until 40 years of follow-up, the exposure of
the intervention factors seemed to be about equal,
also underlined by the results after 21 years of
follow-up [7].
In 2000, all participants in the Oslo diet and
antismoking study were invited to a second screen-
ing examination [11]. Unfortunately, the atten-
dance rate was low (45%), and amongst men in
the diet and antismoking trial, only 140 (of 628)
and 156 (of 604) participated, partly due to a
higher mortality than average compared to the total
screened population. Levels of total serum choles-
terol, and other coronary risk factors, were similar
in the two groups (intervention and control). There
were 37 (26.4%) and 34 (21.8%) daily smokers in
the two groups, that is a difference of about 5% as
observed at the end of the trial. Nevertheless, the
smoking
prevalence
was
higher
than
found
amongst the screened population (17.6%) [11]. It
is difficult, however, from this highly selected
group to explain the continuing benefit on MI
mortality observed in the intervention group by
the effects on these CVD risk factors.
A systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs
investigating the effect of increasing polyunsatu-
rated fat in place of saturated fat provided evidence
of reduced coronary heart disease [12]; however,
these results were not consistent with the findings
of a more recent meta-analysis [1]. Replacement of
saturated fats in the diet with other fats, such as
omega 6 linoleic acid, showed an increased risk of
CVD and total mortality [13], in contrast to our
results. Furthermore, an intervention study of
screening and lifestyle counselling in the general
population failed to show a beneficial effect on

 incidence of ischaemic heart disease, possibly due
to the low net difference in major lifestyle changes
between intervention groups [14, 15].
Ambiguity in the literature regarding these impor-
tant issues clearly underlines the need for more
data from RCTs. The intervention in the present
RCT was to replace saturated fats in the diet with
vegetables, fruits, fish and bread rich in fibre,
and
in
addition,
overweight
participants
were
instructed to reduce weight and reduced intake
of sugar and alcohol. This study provides new
data on well-defined end-points; to our knowl-
edge,
no
other
trial
has
demonstrated
such
lifelong MI mortality benefit after the end of the
study.
The success of our trial may be due to the criteria of
high levels of serum total cholesterol and high
smoking
prevalence
for
selecting
participants.
Thus, the trial design provided high prevention
potential with good ability for proof of concept. Very
high serum total cholesterol (>9.0 mmol L�1) was,
however, an exclusion criteria; all men with such
levels were referred for active treatment [4].
Study limitations
This
study
was
not
designed
to
differentiate
between
the
two
intervention
modalities:
antismoking and dietary advice. The evidence that
dietary changes were mainly responsible for the
mortality outcomes is thus only observational.
Participation at the second screening in the year
2000 was rather low, so biases of medication use
and in levels of risk factors amongst participants in
the two groups cannot be excluded. The decision to
stop follow-up at almost 40 years was arbitrary
but made without knowledge of mortality out-
comes. These results are only applicable to the
relatively small population of male smokers with
high levels of total serum cholesterol. Of note, this
risk profile was far more prevalent 40 years ago
than nowadays.
Conclusions
The randomized Oslo diet and antismoking study
maintained
a
beneficial
effect
of
intervention
regarding death at first MI up to 40 years of
follow-up,
indicating
that
half-yearly
diet
and
healthy lifestyle advice over a 5-year period can
provide lifelong benefits on MI mortality.
