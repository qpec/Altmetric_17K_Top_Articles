Abstract
Background: Ketogenic diets (KD) have become a popular method of promoting weight loss. More recently, some
have recommended that athletes adhere to ketogenic diets in order to optimize changes in body composition
during training. This study evaluated the efficacy of an 8-week ketogenic diet (KD) during energy surplus and
resistance training (RT) protocol on body composition in trained men.
Methods: Twenty-four healthy men (age 30 ± 4.7 years; weight 76.7 ± 8.2 kg; height 174.3 ± 19.7 cm) performed an
8-week RT program. Participants were randomly assigned to a KD group (n = 9), non-KD group (n = 10, NKD), and
control group (n = 5, CG) in hyperenergetic condition. Body composition changes were measured by dual energy
X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Compliance with the ketosis state was monitored by measuring urinary ketones weekly.
Data were analyzed using a univariate, multivariate and repeated measures general linear model (GLM) statistics.
Results: There was a significant reduction in fat mass (mean change, 95% CI; p-value; Cohen’s d effect size [ES]; −
0.8 [− 1.6, − 0.1] kg; p < 0.05; ES = − 0.46) and visceral adipose tissue (− 96.5 [− 159.0, − 34.0] g; p < 0.05; ES = − 0.84),
while no significant changes were observed in the NKD and CG in fat mass (− 0,5 [− 1.2, 0.3] kg; p > 0.05; ES = − 0.17
and − 0,5 [− 2.4, 1.3] kg; p > 0.05; ES = − 0.12, respectively) or visceral adipose tissue (− 33.8 [− 90.4, 22.8]; p > 0.5; ES =
− 0.17 and 1.7 [− 133.3, 136.7]; p > 0.05; ES = 0.01, respectively). No significant increases were observed in total body
weight (− 0.9 [− 2.3, 0.6]; p > 0.05; ES = [− 0.18]) and muscle mass (− 0.1 [− 1.1,1.0]; p > 0,05; ES = − 0.04) in the KD
group, but the NKD group showed increases in these parameters (0.9 [0.3, 1.5] kg; p < 0.05; ES = 0.18 and (1.3[0.5,
2.2] kg; p < 0,05; ES = 0.31, respectively). There were no changes neither in total body weight nor lean body mass
(0.3 [− 1.2, 1.9]; p > 0.05; ES = 0.05 and 0.8 [− 0.4, 2.1]; p > 0.05; ES = 0.26, respectively) in the CG.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that a KD might be an alternative dietary approach to decrease fat mass and
visceral adipose tissue without decreasing lean body mass; however, it might not be useful to increase muscle mass
during positive energy balance in men undergoing RT for 8 weeks.

 Background
Macronutrient manipulation has become a key nutrition
component that, implemented in synergy with training,
seeks to improve physical appearance, performance and
human health. Among many dietary strategies that have
been adopted, ketogenic diet (KD) is a subtype of low-
carbohydrate and high-fat diet that needs to be planned
considering special dietary features (such as the propor-
tion of macronutrients) and physiological changes (ketosis
generation). In view of the foregoing, KD should be
planned from an objective perspective, checking for any
increase in circulating ketone bodies (KB), a distinctive
marker of physiological/nutritional ketosis. Main KB
(acetate, acetone, and β-hydroxybutyrate) are produced in
the liver under low-carbohydrate availability conditions,
acting as an alternative energy source for peripheral tissue,
such as skeletal muscle, brain and heart [1]. To achieve a
state of ketosis through a KD, carbohydrate intake should
be reduced to a maximum of around 50 g per day, or 10%
of total caloric intake during the day, while protein intake
is moderate or high (e.g. ≈1.2 to 1.5 g∙kg− 1⋅d− 1).
Remaining energy intake is predominantly from fats (≈60
to 80%), depending on the degree of displacement of car-
bohydrates and proteins [2].
Under normal conditions (with no KD diet or long
fasting periods), the circulating KB values (β-hydroxybu-
tyrate being the primary KB) are very low (<3 mmol∙L−
1); however, during physiological ketosis, as a result of
the KD, ketonemia can reach maximum levels of ≈7–
8 mmol∙L− 1 with no significant changes in blood pH [3].
At this point, it is important to clarify the difference be-
tween physiological ketosis and diabetic ketoacidosis,
where the concentration of KB in the blood can exceed
≈20 mmol∙L− 1, with a significant reduction in blood pH.
In healthy population, the circulating KB values do not
exceed ≈8 mmol∙L− 1, because the central nervous sys-
tem uses these molecules efficiently as a source of en-
ergy, instead of glucose [4].
Several studies have focused on the effects of KDs on
reducing body mass [5, 6], on improving health condi-
tions, or as part of managing certain pathologies such as
type 2 diabetes mellitus [7, 8], nervous system disorders
such as epilepsy [9–11], and in different types/stages of
cancer [12–16]. Currently, there is some controversy
surrounding the advantages or disadvantages of KD for
sports performance. It has been argued, on the one
hand, that there are beneficial effects associated with the
reduction of total body mass and body fat, a higher rate
of fat oxidation, lower glucose oxidation and a reduction
in the rate of muscle glycogen utilization during physical
exertion, which represents an advantage in resistance
exercise [17]. On the other hand, physiological mecha-
nisms have been cited that may limit performance in re-
sistance training due to central fatigue, possibly because
of increased circulation of non-esterified fatty acids
which increases competition between these and trypto-
phan for albumin, resulting in an increase in free
tryptophan, which in turn causes a greater absorption by the
brain and subsequent augmentation of 5-hydroxytryptamine
(serotonin) synthesis, a neurotransmitter linked to the feel-
ing of lethargy and tiredness that may contribute to nerve
signal losses at central level and a decrease in motivation. In
addition, greater oxidation of amino acids can occur, which
increases the concentration of ammonia, contributing to
central fatigue [17]. In general, several authors have also
established that low-carbohydrate diets or KD do not seem
to be superior or offer advantages for resistance exercise,
compared with carbohydrate-rich diets [18, 19].
With regards to the effects of KD combined with re-
sistance training (RT), such as muscle hypertrophy, there
is even less information available, when compared with
studies conducted on endurance-type performance. Even
though KD can provide adequate quantities of proteins
and calories necessary for muscle-protein synthesis in-
duced by RT, they induce a state similar to fasting,
prompting alterations in the metabolic pathways and
molecular processes relating to autophagy and stress re-
sistance [20], which consequently might hinder the
building of muscle mass.
Considering the need to study on the effects of KD in
resistance-trained subjects, the purpose of this study was
to determine if following a KD hypercaloric diet would
promote greater gains in fat free mass and fat loss dur-
ing a hypertrophic training period in resistance-trained
men. We hypothesized that a KD with caloric surplus in
combination with RT in trained men would have a posi-
tive impact in fat reduction, and it would benefit the
gains in lean body mass (LBM).
Methods
Study design
This study was conducted as a randomized, parallel arm,
controlled, prospective study. The independent variable
was nutritional intervention. The primary outcome vari-
ables were changes in body composition.

± 2.2 kg/m2). All volunteered their participation and
agreed to complete the supervised training and diet pro-
tocols during the 8 weeks of the study. Subjects who had
consumed androgenic-anabolic steroids during the last 2
years or those who consumed any type of dietary supple-
ment during the study were excluded. The subjects were

 advised of the potential risks of the experiment and
signed an informed consent form. The study was devel-
oped following the ethical guidelines of the Declaration
of Helsinki [21]. The investigation was developed in
Málaga (Spain). The first evaluation took place on
February 2017 and the second measurement on April of
the same year.
Procedures
Body composition
Total and regional body composition were estimated
using a Hologic QDR 4500 dual-energy x-ray absorpti-
ometry (DXA) scanner (Hologic Inc., Bedford, MA,
USA). Each subject was scanned by a certified techni-
cian, and the distinguished bone and soft tissue, edge
detection, and regional demarcations were done by com-
puter
algorithms
with
APEX
Software
3.0
(APEX
Corporation Software, Pittsburg, PA, USA). For each
scan, subjects wore sport clothes and were asked to re-
move all materials that could attenuate the X-ray beam,
including jewelry items. Calibration of the densitometer
was checked daily against standard calibration block
supplied by the manufacturer.
Abdominal region was delineated by an upper hori-
zontal border located at half of the distance between
acromions and external end of iliac crests, a lower
border determined by the external end of iliac crests,
and the lateral borders extending to the edge of the
abdominal soft tissue. All trunk tissue within this stan-
dardized height region was selected for analysis. To de-
termine intertester reliability, two different observers
selected the area for each subject manually.
Nutrition intervention
The participants were randomly assigned to a KD group
(n = 9), non-KD (NKD) (n = 10) group, and control group
(CG) (n = 5). Compliance with the ketosis state was moni-
tored by measuring urinary ketones weekly using reagent
strips (Ketostix, Bayer Vital GmbH, Leverkusen, Germany),
from week two to the end of the study in KD group.
Under the supervision of a registered dietitian, the sub-
jects were given a detailed questionnaire about their work
and sociocultural activities, as well as dietary preferences
in order to estimate the basal metabolic rate and physical
activity-related energy expenditure. Subjects were classi-
fied as active in their day-to-day lives, estimating total en-
ergy expenditure in line with the indications [22]. Once
energy expenditure was determined, together with their
weekly training load, a moderate energy surplus was
established for experimental groups, since it has been
noted that trained men do not require energy increases as
high as novice subjects [23, 24]. To guarantee a hyperener-
getic condition, a daily energy intake of ≈39 kcal·kg− 1·d− 1
was used in all subjects. To ensure a maximal anabolic
response, NKD group was given a protein intake of 2
g⋅kg− 1⋅d− 1, as it is recommended for building muscle
mass in trained subjects [2, 22, 25], while 25% of
total
energy
intake
corresponded
to
fat
and
the
remaining
calories
were
given
in
carbohydrates.
Macronutrient distribution for NKD group was about 55%
CHO; 20% PRO and 25% FAT. On the other hand, ≈42 g
total carbohydrates per day were administered to KD
group to ensure the ketosis state [26, 27]. Protein intake
was 2 g⋅kg− 1⋅d− 1, and the remaining calories were given
in fat with a estimating of 3.2 g∙kg− 1⋅d− 1. Macronutrient
distribution for KD group was about <10% CHO; 20%
PRO and 70% FAT. Ad libitum meal timing and frequency
throughout the day was allowed to improve dietary adher-
ence. Even though a specific number of meals per day is
not necessary, provided the daily energy intake is guaran-
teed [22], from 3 to 6 meals were recommended, with the
respective foods selected for the KD group.
Training protocol
During 8 weeks both KD and NKD groups completed
four sessions per week of a hypertrophy training proto-
col,
organized
into
a
2-days
upper-
and
2-days
lower-limb, with 72 h of rest between sessions to en-
courage recovery [28] (Fig. 2).
Participants were experienced in overload training and
used to different nutritional strategies; therefore, no
familiarization session was necessary. Moderate to high
loads were used to encourage mechanical tension [29].
Rest between sets lasted 3 min, so that volume did not
decline [30, 31]. Cadences were explosive in the concen-
tric activation, and 3 s long during the eccentric contrac-
tion to generate more muscle damage [29, 32]. Two
weekly stimuli were provided for each muscle group in
order to optimize the final results [33]. Push and pull
exercises were interspersed for better recovery [34]. Sub-
jects from both groups were asked to increase loads as
long as they exceeded repetition rates and had no error
technique. During the intervention, all participants were

 monitored by an RT specialist who supervised and
checked the load at each training session, and made the
relevant adjustments when was necessary. Meanwhile,
men in control group were asked to maintain their
current level of physical activity during the study.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics tests were applied (mean and
standard deviation, SD). Data were analyzed using a uni-
variate, multivariate and repeated measures general lin-
ear model (GLM), with two levels by time (pre- and
post-test) and considering groups (KD, NKD and CG) as
inter-subjects factor. Wilks’ Lambda multivariate tests
are reported to describe overall effects of related vari-
ables analyzed. Greenhouse-Geisser univariate tests with
least significant difference and post-hoc comparisons
(Bonferroni correction) are presented for individual
variables analyzed. Partial eta squared effect sizes (ηp2)
were also reported on select variables as an indicator of
effect size (ES) of the repeated measures GLM. An Eta
squared around 0.02 was considered small, 0.13 medium,
and 0.26 large [35]. Furthermore, one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA), with a 95.0% confidence level and
Bonferroni post-hoc correction, as is recommended for
these
studies
[36,
37],
was
performed
to
detect
between-group differences in the Δ changes (post-test –
pre-test). In addition, ES calculation was done with
Cohen’s d, as a standardized measurement based on SD
differences; while d = 0.2 was considered a small effect,
d = 0.5 was a medium effect and d = 0.8 was a large ef-
fect, which is used as a guide for substantive signifi-
cance. The normal Gaussian distribution of the data was
verified by the Shapiro-Wilk test. Mean changes with
95% CI’s completely above or below baseline are consid-
ered significant changes from baseline. These statistical
analyses were performed with licensed Statistical Pack-
age for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software (SPSS 24.0,
SPSS
Inc.,
Chicago,
USA)
and
GraphPad
software
(GraphPad Prism 7.03, California, USA).
Results
Baseline characteristics
A total number of 26 individuals met initial screening
criteria and consented to participate in the study (Fig. 1).
Two participants did not enter into ketosis state and
were excluded from the study, which left nine men for
analysis in KD group. Statistical analyses were performed
on 24 individuals. Descriptive statistics with baseline
characteristics are summarized, by groups in Table 1.
Body composition
The statistical results before and after the intervention
for total body weight (BW) and body composition; fat
mass (FM), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and LBM are
shown in Table 2. Multivariate analysis showed signifi-
cant overall Wilks’ Lambda in time interaction (p =

 0.031; with a large effect size, ηp2 = 0.36) and in time x
group (p < 0.05; with a large effect size, ηp2 = 0.264). On
the other hand, univariate analysis revealed significant
differences in time x group interaction between BW, and
LBM (p < 0.05), with a large effect size for BW (ηp2 >
0.36); however, no significant differences were found in
VAT. Significant differences were observed over time in
VAT and LBM, with medium effect size for both (ηp2 =
0.20 and 0.23, respectively). No significant differences
were found after group interaction analysis of the study
variables.
According to the results by group, BW increased in
KD group (p < 0.05), but to a small size (ES = 0.18), with
no significant differences in the other groups (NKD and
CG). With regards to FM, only KD group showed a sig-
nificant reduction (p < 0.05), expressing a medium effect
(ES = − 0.46). Similarly, VAT only decreased markedly in
the KD group (p < 0.05), showing a considered large
effect (ES = − 0.84). Conversely, LBM showed a highly
significant increase (p < 0.05) with moderate effect (ES =
0.31) in the NKD group; however, although LBM de-
creased in the KD group, this did not represent a statis-
tically significant difference or significant effect (p > 0.05;
ES = − 0.04).
These results suggest that KD group achieved a posi-
tive change in body composition, due to a decrease in
BW (− 0.9 [− 2.3, 0.6] kg; p > 0.05) with a reduction in
FM (− 0.8 [− 1.6, − 0.1] kg; p < 0.05) and accompanied by
a notably lower VAT (− 96.5 [− 159.0, − 34.0] g; p < 0.05).
Regarding to LBM, an adequate carbohydrate intake
(non-ketogenic or conventional dietary approach), in
conjunction with a caloric surplus and a higher protein
intake, might be the most viable option for inducing
muscle hypertrophy after RT. This last was shown in this
study, where there was an increase in LBM (1.3 [0.5, 2.2]
kg; p < 0.05) in the NKD group, leading to an increase in
BW (− 0.9 [− 2.3, 0.6] kg; p < 0.05). Figure 3 shows sig-
nificant differences in BW and LBM for NKD group;
and FM and VAT for KD group. Likewise, post-hoc ana-
lysis showed significant difference in the BW and LBM
between KD and NDK groups.
Discussion
The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of
the KD when combined with an RT program on body
composition in trained subjects over a period of 8 weeks
of intervention.
We
originally
hypothesized
that
this
intervention
would improve body composition due to a greater re-
duction in FM and VAT, and an increase in LBM. Our
hypothesis is supported by some lines of evidence, but
there are contradictory findings due to a lack of studies
analyzing the effects of the KD (with and without RT
protocol) on FM, VAT and muscle hypertrophy. Human

 studies have reported a reduction in FM during and after
KD, but with a concomitant loss of of LBM [38–44]. For
example, Gomez-Arbelaez [45], found that a low-calorie
KD (starting in the initial phases with ≈600–800 kcal per
day and following the PNK® method) resulted in a de-
crease in VAT, according to a follow-up study performed
over 4 months. Notwithstanding, it should be noted that
these studies included obese subjects, in some cases with
at least one cardiovascular risk factor and, with no phys-
ical exercise intervention, strength training in particular.
In another study [46], there was a reduction in adipose
mass tissue and a parallel increase in LBM after per-
forming a variety of strength or resistance exercises in
moderately active subjects with normal weight; these
changes in body composition (especially FM reduction)
were attributed in part to a decrease in insulin concen-
trations. It is probable that the incorporation of RT,
together with moderate/high protein consumption and a
caloric surplus, may be an important strategy for main-
taining fat free mass during KD. In particular, RT alone,
or combined with endurance training, accompanied by a
hypoenergetic KD, might be useful for the preservation
of fat free mass and the increased metabolic rate in
obese subjects, as an intervention that deserves further
research, considering the complexity of this multifactor-
ial illness [47]. In fact, even though endurance exercise
is more effective than RT in reducing VAT [48], a com-
bination of endurance training and RT is more plausible
for improving body composition in this population [49].
Since few studies have evaluated the combined effect of
the KD and RT in trained subjects on VAT, our study
contributes to current literature by showing a significant
reduction in VAT after 8 weeks of KD in hyperenergetic
condition in resistance-trained men. These results sug-
gest that KD group achieved a positive change in body
composition, due to a decrease in BW (− 0.9 [− 2.3, 0.6]
kg; p > 0.05) with a reduction in FM (− 0.8 [− 1.6, − 0.1]
kg; p < 0.05) and accompanied by a notably lower VAT
(− 96.5 [− 159.0, − 34.0] g; p < 0.05). This supports the
need for in-depth analysis about the importance of
macronutrient distribution, comparing isoenergetic nu-
tritional programs, on the distribution of body fat.
On the other hand, animal studies on ketosis-induced
interventions after KD have not found neither acute nor
chronic changes in hypertrophic response in skeletal
muscle, when strength exercises were performed, in
comparison with a mixed diet of macronutrients [50];
however, a reduction in FM was observed in these ro-
dents [51]. Although these results were obtained in
animal models, it seems that these effects are similar but
not
extrapolable
to
humans.
Our
study
involved
resistance-trained young men with an RT program inter-
vention focused on mechanical tension to generate
changes in LBM, considering this as one of the main fac-
tors of RT-induced muscle hypertrophy [29, 52, 53].
Also, a 3 min-rest pause between sets and short time
under tension was considered, to discourage a dramatic
decrease in muscle glycogen. Subsequently, comparison
of changes in variables, by one-factor ANOVA, revealed
a difference between means in all groups regarding BW
and LBM; in fact, there was an increase in LBM (1.3
[0.5,2.2] kg; p < 0.05) in the NKD group, leading to an
increase in BW (− 0.9 [− 2.3, 0.6] kg; p < 0.05). Figure 3
shows significant differences in BW and LBM for NKD
group; and FM and VAT for KD group. Likewise,
post-hoc analysis showed significant difference in the
BW and LBM between KD and NDK groups. These re-
sults are in agreement with those obtained by Rauch et
al. [54], who compared the effects of a KD (5% CHO,
75% fat and 20% protein) with a traditional western diet
(55% CHO, 25% fat and 20% protein) in men undergoing
RT training (n = 26), during 11 weeks. These authors
also found a decrease in FM in the KD group but, unlike
our results, there was an increase in LBM.
The results of the present study are in accordance with

 program; however, no changes were seen in LBM in
this group. The clinical significance is the reduction in
VAT, which could have health benefit because of its in-
verse correlation to cardiometabolic disease [55, 56].
Regarding to LBM, an adequate carbohydrate intake
(non-ketogenic or conventional dietary approach), in con-
junction with a caloric surplus and a higher protein intake,
might be the most viable option for inducing muscle
hypertrophy after RT.
Limitations
This study has several limitations that should be men-
tioned. Firstly, this research only included body compos-
ition measurements and did not include blood measures.
In addition, limited outcome measurements, small num-
ber of subjects and intervention time (8 weeks) reduce
the impact of the study. On the other hand, dietary as-
sessment of appetite suppression by high-fat diet was
not performed. So, it is possible to have variations in en-
ergy intake even though participants were instructed to
follow
specific
dietary
recommendations.
Moreover,
since KD may affect negatively training volume, we
should consider integrating performance measurements
or load volume to see changes. In addition, rated
perceived exertion might give interesting information
about changes during KD adaptation and progression of
RT protocol.
Conclusions
According to our results, we concluded that subjects
who underwent RT during a KD experienced a greater
reduction in FM and VAT, when compared to the NKD
group. The greater reduction in VAT may have some
clinical relevance due to its inverse association to
cardio-metabolic risk. Further studies are necessary to
evaluate the advantages of this combination (RT and
KD) in subjects with excess of body FM, with particular
attention to the reported significant reduction in VAT,
which might be highly beneficial to this population given
that LBM is maintained. Indeed, this research showed
no significant changes nor effect size on LBM, despite
hyperenergetic
condition
and
high
protein
intake
(2.0 g∙kg− 1⋅d− 1) in resistance-trained men of the KD
group. Thus, we conclude that low-carbohydrate dietary
approaches, such as KD, would not be an optimum
strategy for building muscle mass in trained men under
the
training
conditions
of
this
study
(mechanical
tension-focused RT protocol during 8 weeks).
