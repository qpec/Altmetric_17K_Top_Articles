Medical research is moving toward prevention strategies during
prodromal states. Postpartum blues (PPB) is often a prodromal state
for postpartum depression (PPD), with severe PPB strongly associ-
ated with an elevated risk for PPD. The most common complication
of childbearing, PPD has a prevalence of 13%, but there are no
widespread prevention strategies, and no nutraceutical interven-
tions have been developed. To counter the effects of the 40%
increase in monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) levels that occurs during
PPB, a dietary supplement kit consisting of monoamine precursor
amino acids and dietary antioxidants was created. Key ingredients
(tryptophan and tyrosine) were shown not to affect their total
concentration in breast milk. The aim of this open-label study was to
assess whether this dietary supplement reduces vulnerability
to depressed mood at postpartum day 5, the typical peak of PPB.
Forty-one healthy women completed all study procedures. One
group (n = 21) received the dietary supplement, composed of
2 g of tryptophan, 10 g of tyrosine, and blueberry juice with blue-
berry extract. The control group (n = 20) did not receive any sup-
plement. PPB severity was quantitated by the elevation in
depressed mood on a visual analog scale following the sad mood
induction procedure (MIP). Following the MIP, there was a robust
induction of depressed mood in the control group, but no effect in
the supplement group [43.85 ± 18.98 mm vs. 0.05 ± 9.57 mm shift;
effect size: 2.9; F(1,39) = 88.33, P < 0.001]. This dietary supplement
designed to counter functions of elevated MAO-A activity elimi-
nates vulnerability to depressed mood during the peak of PPB.

t is increasingly believed that the optimal approach to prevent
neuropsychiatric illnesses is to target prodromal states. Post-
partum blues (PPB), a subclinical syndrome of low mood and
emotional lability often associated with fatigue, insomnia, poor
appetite, and anxiety, may be conceptualized as a prodromal state,
given that severe PPB is strongly predictive of later clinical-level
postpartum depression (PPD) (1–5). For example, O’Hara et al. (2)
reported a 6% risk of PPD in women without severe PPB, com-
pared with 23% in women with severe PPB. PPB affects ∼75% of
women during postpartum days 4–6, typically peaking on day 5 and
resolving within 10 days (5). Most research criteria define PPD as a
major depressive episode (MDE) occurring within the first 1–12 mo
postpartum and identify it as the most common complication of
childbearing, with an overall prevalence of 13% (6, 7). For women
with a previous MDE, either antidepressants or intensive evidence-
based psychological therapy may help prevent PPD (8), but for the
majority of pregnant women with no history of an MDE, there is no
standard, widespread approach for preventing new-onset PPD.
Given that severe PPB heralds the onset of PPD, it may be
useful to decrease the severity of PPB to prevent PPD. The
present study focused on a dietary supplement-based strategy to
create resilience against an important component of the neuro-
biology of PPB. The peak of PPB at postpartum day 5 occurs just
after a several hundred-fold drop in the level of estrogens and a
50-fold decline in progesterone level. Given that paradigms of
simulated pregnancy involving similar changes in estrogens
and progesterone levels elicit depressive symptoms, sequelae of
these hormonal changes are implicated in the neurobiology of
PPB (6, 9). In human studies, the most prominent brain change
identified in PPB is a 43% elevation in monoamine oxidase A
(MAO-A) levels, extending into affect-modulating brain regions
(10–14). This elevated MAO-A level may be attributed in large
part to the decline in the level of estrogens, given the known
inverse relationship between changes in the concentration of
Significance
Postpartum blues is a healthy range of sadness that peaks on day
5 after giving birth in most women. Severe postpartum blues is a
high-risk state for postpartum depression. A dietary supplement
was designed to compensate for a temporary rise in a brain pro-
tein, monoamine oxidase A, which occurs on postpartum day 5.
This study tested whether this dietary supplement reduces the
sadness associated with the postpartum blues. Total levels of
tryptophan and tyrosine in breast milk are not affected by this
dietary supplement. Women received the dietary supplement over
postpartum days 3–5 or received no supplement. This dietary
supplement dramatically reduced the vulnerability to sadness on
postpartum day 5, the peak of the postpartum blues, eliminating
the prodrome of postpartum depression.

 estrogens and MAO-A mRNA, density, and activity (15–19). Re-
ductions in brain GABA levels and increased serotonin transporter
levels have also been reported in human studies, and in rodents
altered sensitivity of GABA type A receptor δ subunits, reduced
Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα, and reduced neu-
rogenesis in the hippocampus have been reported in the early
postpartum period (20–22).
The aim of the present study was to determine whether a dietary
supplement kit designed to counter the sequelae of elevated MAO-A
levels in the early postpartum period reduces a woman’s vulnera-
bility to depressed mood during PPB. We hypothesized that ad-
ministration of the dietary supplement would generate resiliency
against the induction of depressed mood in the early postpartum
period. Depressed mood and mood lability are symptoms of PPB
(23). Vulnerability to the induction of depressed mood is a quan-
titative measure of the severity of these symptoms and also a marker
of elevated risk for MDE (24, 25). The reason for prioritizing ele-
vated MAO-A levels in the design of this supplement was that the
timing of this change was definitively demonstrated during PPB and
the magnitude of MAO-A elevation throughout grey matter during
PPB is enormous, including brain regions that generate emotion
such as the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and hippo-
campus (13, 14). Moreover, it is well known that elevated MAO-A
level is associated with MDE, depressed mood states, and high-risk
states for MDE (26–29).
Because MAO-A protein density is often highly correlated with
MAO-A activity in the brain (30, 31), the supplement included
several ingredients designed to counter the effects of enhanced
MAO-A function, including increased metabolism of serotonin,
norepinephrine, and dopamine. MAO-A catalyzes the oxidative
deamination of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine (32).
One of the products of this reaction is hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).
With higher MAO-A activity, these levels might become supra-
physiological, which may generate excessive oxidative stress, with
potential adverse cellular consequences (32). Oxidative stress has
been associated with anxiety behaviors in rodents, and markers of
oxidative stress are sometimes elevated in mood disorders (33, 34).
The serotonin precursor tryptophan was added to the supplement
to compensate for excessive serotonin removal, and the norepi-
nephrine and dopamine precursor tyrosine was intended to com-
pensate for excessive norepinephrine and dopamine removal. To
counter pro-oxidant effects, a combination of blueberry juice and
blueberry extract was included, which contains the dietary anti-
oxidants anthocyanins. Investigations of blueberry anthocyanins have
suggested that they cross the blood-brain barrier, and manipulations
of tryptophan and tyrosine levels in plasma through dietary chal-
lenges have been shown in some studies to affect the release of se-
rotonin, dopamine, and, to a lesser extent, norepinephrine in rodent
brain (35–39). Moreover, administering tryptophan and tyrosine in
excess of dietary levels has been empirically demonstrated to have no
effect on their total concentrations in breast milk, a finding consis-
tent with longstanding knowledge that 99% of amino acids in breast
milk are in fixed chains within peptides and proteins (40, 41).
Results
Fifty-two subjects were enrolled in the protocol, and seven
dropped out of the study (five in the supplemented group and
two controls) after their first visit. One dropout had moved away,
three dropouts indicated that they did not wish to commit to the
time involved, and three stopped returning phone calls. Four
subjects (all from the supplemented group) were excluded, one
because of a high baseline depressed mood on the visual analog
scale (VAS), which could have biased her change score in favor
of the study result; one who required an immediate caesarean

 section due to a major obstetrical complication; one who had a
positive urine drug screen on postpartum day 5; and one because
of an unexpected preterm delivery birth. Forty-one subjects
completed the study protocol (20 controls, 21 in the supplemented
group). The mean age was similar in the two groups: 32.55 ± 3.07 y
in controls and 31.73 ± 5.26 y in the supplemented group. Other
demographic and clinical characteristics of the two groups were
similar as well (Table 1). Total Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)
on screening day and postpartum day 5 and NEO Personality
Inventory-Revised (NEO PI-R) subscale scores were similar in the
two groups. The dietary supplement was well tolerated by all
subjects, and no adverse effects were reported.
An increase in depressed mood on the VAS after the mood
induction procedure (MIP) was seen in the control group, which
was attenuated by administration of the supplement in the
supplemented group [effect size: 2.9; interaction with group:
F(1,39)=88.33, P < 0.001, repeated-measures ANOVA] (Figs. 1
and 2). After the MIP, depressed mood as measured on the VAS
increased by 43.85 ± 18.98 mm in the untreated controls and by
0.05 ± 9.57 mm in the supplemented group (Fig. 2).
We also assessed the effect of the dietary supplement as a pre-
dictor of change in Profile of Mood States (POMS) depression
scores. There was an increase in depressed mood on the POMS
after the MIP in the control group, which was attenuated by ad-
ministration of the supplement in the treatment group [interaction
with group: F(1,39) = 20.24, P < 0.001, repeated-measures
ANOVA] (Fig. 3). After the MIP, the POMS depression score
increased by 8.95 ± 8.75 in the controls and decreased by −0.05 ±
2.67 in the supplemented group.
There were no significant effects of body mass index, third tri-
mester depressive symptoms, parity, infant sex, self-report of recent
sleep quality, or presence of neonatal complications on changes in
the depressed mood VAS score or POMS depression score (Table
S1). Furthermore, POMS subscale scores rose in several domains
after the sad MIP in controls, but these changes were negligible in
the supplemented group: confusion [F(1,39) = 10.16, P = 0.003,
repeated-measures ANOVA], anger [F(1,39) = 9.63, P = 0.004,
repeated-measures ANOVA], fatigue [F(1,39) = 5.10, P =
0.030, repeated-measures ANOVA], and tension [F(1,39) = 7.16,
P = 0.011, repeated-measures ANOVA]. Moreover, after the sad
MIP, there was an increase in VAS fatigue scores in the controls,
which was attenuated in the supplemented group [F(1,39) = 8.01,
P = 0.007, repeated-measures ANOVA].
Two subjects in the control group and one subject in the sup-
plemented group subsequently endorsed the structured clinical in-
terview (SCID) for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) symptoms of MDE within the first
3 mo postpartum [exploratory analysis: X2(1) = 0.550, P = 0.458].
Discussion
This study demonstrates a strong beneficial effect of an in-
tervention to reduce sadness during the peak period of PPB. The
principal finding was that an open trial of a dietary supplement
consisting of 2 g tryptophan, 10 g tyrosine, and blueberry juice/
extract virtually eliminated intense PPB. The robust effect found
suggests that the approach of creating dietary kits to target neuro-
biological changes in prodromal states may be a promising new
avenue for nutraceutical development. The degree of the effect
attributable to the intervention vs. the placebo effect must be
considered, however.
Evidence-based nutraceutical development frequently stems
from observed associations between dietary intake and disease
prevalence, followed by clinical trials to assess the effect of dietary
supplementation on disease onset. Although this approach has
been helpful in some circumstances (e.g., prevention of neural
tube defects in newborns through folic acid supplementation),
successful nutraceutical development is rare in neuropsychiatry,
most likely because the pathway for nutraceutical development to
prevent neuropsychiatric illnesses is not standardized.
The approach that we took for this dietary supplement is a dis-
tinctly different strategy and represents a prototypal pathway. First,
a prodromal state for PPD was prioritized. Second, a dietary kit was
designed to counter a key neurobiological change in elevated MAO-A
levels (>40%) during the prodromal state that extended into several
brain regions involved in regulating emotion. MAO-A is also a well-
proven target for antidepressants and a well-characterized human

 phenotype, being present in MDE, in several high-risk states for
MDE onset, and in depressed mood states in both health and illness
(14, 26–29). Third, evidence for brain penetrant effects was con-
sidered in the selection of individual ingredients of the dietary kit.
Altering dietary tryptophan, especially by inducing a deficiency,
reduces serotonin release in the prefrontal cortex of rodents and
increases depressed mood in humans at high risk for MDE (36, 42).
Oral tyrosine administration increases resiliency against stress-
induced impairment of cognitive tasks, and depletion of tyro-
sine induces depressed mood and reduces stimulant-provoked
dopamine release in humans and rodents (38, 39, 43, 44).
Most previous investigations in animals of blueberry-sourced
anthocyanins given through the diet have reported the detection
of anthocyanins in brain homogenates (35, 37). The significant
effect of the supplement on the prodrome of PPB seen in the
present study supports further studies to evaluate its effect on later
sequelae such as PPD, with the eventual overall intent of creating
a dietary supplement that may be accepted by clinicians and health
care providers as a widespread approach to prevent PPD.
The main strength of this trial is its large effect size of 2.9.
However, given that we conducted the first investigation of this
supplement in humans with an open trial, the contribution of pla-
cebo should be considered in the context of effect size from other
interventions for PPB. The magnitude of the placebo effect is widely
perceived to be influenced by the level of interaction between re-
searchers and subjects, and also by the extent of the support pro-
vided during psychoeducation interventions. In the several other
intervention studies in PPB, the effect sizes on symptoms were small,
suggesting that the placebo effects are also small. For psycho-
education and for dietary fish oil, effect sizes, including those for the
control conditions, have ranged from 0.07 to 0.3, and the severity of
PPB after these interventions was similar to the typical literature
reports, suggesting that the placebo effect on PPB is low and unlikely
to account for the effect size of the present study (45, 46).
This study has several limitations. The first is that this intervention
to reduce PPB likely can be optimized further; for example, other
biological changes in the early postpartum period, such as reduced
neurogenesis, might be targeted through exercise (20), or psychoso-
cial support could be provided concurrently to reduce stress (47).
Second, although we developed the supplement with the intent of
countering elevated MAO-A levels, it is possible that other mecha-
nisms may have been responsible for the effects observed. For ex-
ample, tryptophan is well known to improve sleep through reducing
sleep latency, and tyrosine is known to increase resilience against
stressful events (48, 49). Third, subjects were assigned based on
protocol availability rather than through a fully randomized double-
blind, placebo-controlled trial. The study started by measuring the
sensitivity to MIP and then moved on to the effect of the proposed
dietary supplement on this sensitivity. This study represents an early
phase of development of a dietary supplement for preventing PPD.
The results are striking, regardless of order. Finally, because the focus
in this experiment was on PPB as a prodrome rather than on PPD
itself, further work is needed to extend this approach to directly assess
the effects on PPD.
In conclusion, a combination of orally administered tryptophan,
tyrosine, and blueberry extract/blueberry juice almost completely
eliminated the vulnerability to depressed mood during the peak
period of PPB in our subjects, with an effect size of 2.9, which is at
least 10-fold greater than the effect size reported for other in-
terventions, including placebo. This study exemplifies a low-cost
nutraceutical pathway for creating a dietary supplement kit to
compensate for biological vulnerability in a prodromal state result-
ing in a robust reduction of symptoms.
Materials and Methods
Study Design and Study Participants. Women aged 18–45 y were recruited through
advertisements and screened during the last trimester of pregnancy. These women
were eligible to participate if they were healthy, medication-free, and able to
provide informed consent. Exclusion criteria were use of any investigational me-
dicinal product or natural health product medication within the previous 8 wk,
current diagnosis or history of any axis 1 and/or axis 2 disorders based on the SCID
for DSM-IV (50), or substance abuse (screened with urine drug test). In addition, to
reduce variability in mood attributable to cigarette withdrawal, subjects who
reported cigarette smoking in the past 5 years were excluded from the study. The
effect of the MIP was previously reported in a subset of 11 controls (24).
The dietary supplement consisted of 2 g L-tryptophan, 10 g L-tyrosine,
blueberry juice, and blueberry extract. These specific dosages of L-tryptophan
and L-tyrosine have been shown to significantly elevate free tryptophan and
free tyrosine in plasma and to be well tolerated, but not to increase total
tryptophan and total tyrosine in breast milk (40, 41). Tryptophan, which also
may help initiate sleep, was given in the evening of postpartum day 4, and
tyrosine was given on the morning of day 5, to avoid competition at the large
neutral amino acid transporters for transport through the blood-brain barrier.
The 1-mg L-tryptophan capsules (Apo-tryptophan) were obtained from Apo-
tex, and 500-mg L-tyrosine capsules were obtained from Trophic Canada. The
blueberry extract powder VitaBlue was obtained from Future Ceuticals and
prepared and packaged at the National Sanitation Foundation International’s
Guelph Food Technology Centre (NSF-GFTC), in sachets containing 1 g of pow-
der. Blueberry juice was obtained from Milne Fruit Products and packaged at the
GFTC in 280-mL bottles. At the point of consumption, the blueberry juice and
extract were mixed to form a readily digestible, highly palatable beverage. The
blueberry extract was added to the blueberry juice because of the anthocyanin
damage that occurs during the pasteurization of blueberry juice.
Because this was the first administration of the supplement to postpartum
women, an open trial design was chosen. Initially, the first 60% of the subjects
were assigned to the control group, followed by recruitment of 60% of the
supplement group. Afterward, recruitment was run concurrently, with sep-
arate advertisements for each group alternated to obtain continuous en-
rollment in each group. The study was described as a trial to aid research in
the area of PPD. Given that this was the first study of this supplement in the
postpartum period, prospective subjects were informed that although we
had no evidence of the supplement’s efficacy, the doses of L-tryptophan and
L-tyrosine that were above dietary intake levels were known not to affect
the total concentrations of these components in breast milk.
The protocol involved one visit for screening and one visit for measure-
ment of mood. The first visit was a screening visit done during the last tri-
mester of pregnancy. During this visit, subjects were evaluated with the SCID
for DSM-IV, BDI, and the NEO PI-R. The second visit was the active protocol
day, occurring on postpartum day 5. Shortly after giving birth, women in the
supplemented group received the supplement ingredients with an in-
struction sheet to take the supplement over the course of 3 d, starting on
postpartum day 3 (Table 2). At the time of tryptophan administration, the
subjects also received a phone call. Tyrosine and blueberry juice/extract
administration (the only challenging part of the protocol, owing to the
number of tyrosine capsules) was visually verified on postpartum day 5. On
each day of supplement administration, subjects were questioned about the
tolerability of the supplements, to record any side effects.

 Assessment of Vulnerability to Depressed Mood Induction. Our measurement
focused on postpartum day 5 because this is the peak point of depression, mood
lability, and PPB severity (2, 23, 51). It is also the time point with the most
robust elevation in MAO-A levels throughout the brain, including affect-
modulating brain regions, in the early postpartum period (14). PPB is usually
negligible before postpartum day 3 and after the peak at day 5 shows a
variable rate of decline, but usually resolves by day 10 (23). Timing of the
assessments was identical in the control and supplemented groups.
During the second visit, the subjects underwent a neutral MIP, followed by a
sad MIP and then another neutral MIP. Measurements of mood were applied
before and after the sad MIP. The purpose of the first neutral MIP was to reduce
the environmental effects on mood, and the purpose of the second neutral MIP
was to remove any effects of the sad MIP (Fig. 1). To induce sad and neutral
mood states, the Velten (52) MIP was used in combination with the approach
of Clark et al. (53). The Velten method, a series of 60 read self-referent
statements, is the most widely used technique for studying affective influences
upon behavior and it has demonstrated effectiveness in altering subjective
emotional states. Negative statements reflect pessimism, dissatisfaction, or
lethargy (e.g., “life is a heavy burden”). An example of a neutral statement is
“an orange is a citrus fruit.” Subjects were asked to read each statement,
printed individually, first to themselves and then aloud, and to “feel and ex-
perience each statement as it would apply to you personally.” In addition, to
facilitate the MIP, the subjects also listened to music while reading the state-
ments, based on work by Clark et al. (53). The subjects listened to Prokofiev’s
“Russia Under the Mongolian Yoke” for the sad MIP and to Mozart’s “Piano
Concerto No. 21 in C Major” for the neutral MIP.
Measures. The primary outcome measure used in this study was the change in
the standard VAS (10 cm) for rating depressed mood after the sad MIP. The
VAS contains a total of seven items consistent with how the subject feels at
the moment. The additional items included ratings for being drowsy, excited,
tense, stressed, without energy, and anxious. To represent the baseline VAS, a
mean VAS score was calculated from the two VAS scores obtained before the
sad MIP (VAS1 and VAS2). To represent the VAS post-MIP, a mean VAS score
for the two VAS scores obtained after the sad MIP (VAS3 and VAS4) was
calculated (Fig. 1). Two additional VAS scores (VAS5 and VAS6) were
obtained afterward as part of a safety protocol to confirm that the subject’s
depressed mood had been normalized.
For an additional measure of sadness, subjects also completed the POMS
(65-adjective version) concomitantly with the VAS. From the POMS, six factors
were derived, including depression, tension, anger, fatigue, vigor, and con-
fusion. Measurement of scores attributable to the sad MIP was calculated in
the same manner as for the VAS scores.
Statistical Analyses. The primary analysis was a repeated-measures ANOVA
with the baseline and post-MIP VAS depressed mood scores as the dependent
variables and group (control or supplemented group) as a between-subject
factor. The secondary analysis was repeated-measures ANOVA with baseline
and post-MIP depression subscale score of the POMS as the dependent variables
and group (control or supplemented group) as the between-subject factor.
Regulatory Approvals. This study was approved by the Research Ethics Board
for Human Subjects at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto
and the Natural Health Product Directorate and Drug Directorate of Health
Canada. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects after a
thorough explanation of the study, and each subject was free to withdraw at
any time during the study. All experiments on human subjects were con-
ducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International
Conference on Harmonization’s Good Clinical Practice guidelines. This trial is
registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier NCT02073175).
