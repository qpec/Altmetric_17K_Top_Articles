Background: Prices of anti-cancer drugs are skyrocking. We aimed to assess the clinical benefit of new drugs for treating
advanced solid tumors at the time of their approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and to search for a relation
between price and clinical benefit of drugs.
Materials and methods: We included all new molecular entities and new biologics for treating advanced solid cancer that
were approved by the FDA between 2000 and 2015. The clinical benefit of drugs was graded based on FDA medical review of
pivotal clinical trials using the 2016-updated of the American Society of Clinical Oncology Value Framework (ASCO-VF) and the
European Society for Medical Oncology Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (ESMO-MCBS). Characteristics of drugs and
approvals were obtained from publicly available FDA documents and price was evaluated according to US Medicare, US
Veterans Health Administration and United Kingdom market systems.
Results: The FDA approved 51 new drugs for advanced solid cancer from 2000 to 2015; we could evaluate the value of
37 drugs (73%). By the ESMO-MCBS, five drugs (14%) were grade one (the lowest), nine (24%) grade two, 10 (27%) grade three,
11 (30%) grade four and two (5%) grade five (the highest). Thus, 13 drugs (35%) showed a meaningful clinical benefit (scale lev-
els 4 and 5). By the ASCO-VF which had a range of 3.4–67, the median drug value was 37 (interquartile range 20–52). We found
no relationship between clinical benefit and drug price (P ¼ 0.9). No characteristic of drugs and of approval was significantly
associated with clinical benefit.
Conclusion: Many recently FDA-approved new cancer drugs did not have high clinical benefit as measured by current scales.
We found no relation between the price of drugs and benefit to society and patients.
Key words: value-based purchasing, relative value scales, prescription drugs, costs and cost analysis, neoplasms/drug
therapy
Introduction
The concept of the value of drugs has recently dominated oncol-
ogy. Massive investments in research yielded major advances in the
comprehension of tumor biology, which has translated to an in-
crease in number of new anti-cancer drugs approved by the US
Food and Drug Association (FDA). Hence, new anticancer drugs
have yielded high expectations from all stakeholders. Especially,
drugs for personalized medicine—patients to be treated are
selected on the basis of a predictive (genomic) biomarker—repre-
sent great hope for the oncology community [1]. Similarly, first-
in-class drugs (relying on a new pharmacological mechanism of
action) represent a measure of innovation success and could there-
fore have high value [2]. An increasing number of drugs has been
approved by using pathways and designations to expedite drug ap-
proval [3]; these are drugs that are intended for life-threatening
conditions and unmet medical need.

 The skyrocketing price of oncology drugs has led various stake-
holders (patients, physicians and third-party payers) to criticize the
pricing policies of manufacturers [4] and, combined with the high
burden of cancer, has highlighted the question of the value of cancer
drugs [5]. The high price of drugs is often justified by the need to
support research and development, but an analysis of the most
transformative drugs showed that, actually, government-funded
academic research was the primary source of drug innovation [6].
A critical question for the oncology community is how to assess
the value of drugs. Two important oncology societies have recently
taken a step forward in this endeavor: The American Society of
Clinical Oncology (ASCO) published its Conceptual Framework
to Assess the Value of Cancer Treatment Options (ASCO-VF) [7],
which was updated in 2016 [8], and the European Society for
Medical Oncology developed its Magnitude of Clinical Benefit
Scale (ESMO-MCBS) for drugs indicated in the treatment of solid
cancer [9]. Both scales have been designed with the aim of evaluat-
ing the value of anti-cancer drugs by ‘[balancing] the magnitude of
its clinical benefit [. . .] against its cost’ [9].
This study aimed to describe the clinical benefit of new drugs
for treating advanced solid cancer that were recently approved by
the FDA and to search for a relationship between clinical benefit
and price of drugs and for characteristics associated with clinical
benefit. We restricted this study to drugs for treating advanced
solid cancer because the (i) ESMO-MCBS is applicable only for
drugs treating solid cancers and (ii) the vast majority of new anti-
cancer drugs are indicated in the advanced setting.
Methods
List of drugs
We included all new drugs (new molecular entities and novel biologics)
indicated for treating advanced solid cancer that were approved by the
FDA between 2000 and 2015.
Description of the ASCO-VF net health
benefit (NHB)
The ASCO-VF NHB has three main components: (i) magnitude of treat-
ment effect, (ii) toxicity and (iii) bonus points [8]. The magnitude of
treatment effect is assessed by overall survival (OS) if reported; if OS is
not reported, progression-free survival (PFS) is used; and if neither OS
nor PFS are reported, overall response rate (ORR) is used. Treatment ef-
fect size for OS and PFS is quantified by hazard ratios (HR) and difference
in median survival time and weighted by type of endpoint. For instance,
an HR of 0.7 for OS yields 30 points, but the same HR for PFS would yield
only 21 points.
The toxicity score ranges from -20 to þ20. The value depends on the
frequency and severity of toxic effects. A null value corresponds to a new
drug with similar toxicity as for the control. Negative points are for a new
drug associated with high toxicity and positive points are awarded if the
new drug reduces toxicity as compared with the control.
If a treatment is associated with long-term benefit, it can be awarded
‘tail of the curve’ bonus points (16 points for PFS or 20 for OS). Three
other possible bonuses include a ten-point bonus for treatments improv-
ing cancer-related symptoms, another ten-point bonus for improving
quality-of-life (QoL) and another ten-point bonus for improving
treatment-free interval. These bonuses can be cumulative. The sum of the
magnitude of treatment effect, toxicity and bonus points gives the NHB
(ASCO-VF NHB) [8].
Description of the ESMO-MCBS
The ESMO-MCBS has two main components: (i) a preliminary score based
on the clinical benefit and (ii) modification (upgrade and downgrade) of
the primary score based on the toxicity and QoL, which yields the final
score based on five-point scale ranging from one, lowest grade, to five,
highest grade [9]. Levels four and five correspond to a meaningful clinical
benefit [9, 10]. In the first part, a preliminary score is calculated on the basis
of the clinical benefit of the drug according to the primary endpoint of the
study. The treatment effect size is quantified by either (i) the lower limit of
the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the HR and by differences in median
survival or (ii) by the increase in survival at a fixed time (two or three years
depending on the median survival time with the standard treatment).
When HRs and the increase in survival at a fixed time yield different results,
the best score is used. With OS, the preliminary value ranges from one to
four and could be upgraded if the treatment improves QoL or reduced
grade three to four toxicity affecting daily well-being. Hence, the final value
for drugs evaluated with OS ranges from one to five. For drugs evaluated
with PFS, the preliminary value ranges from one to three and could be
upgraded with the same conditions as for OS. However, the score could be
downgraded with increased toxicity or if a drug leads to only a benefit for
PFS (i.e. without a benefit for OS) and fails to show an improvement in
QoL. The maximal value for drugs evaluated with PFS is thus four. The
ESMO-MCBS indicates that levels four and five correspond to ASCO
guidelines for meaningful clinical benefit [9, 10].
Grading of the clinical benefit drug by using the
ASCO-VF and ESMO-MCBS
We graded the drugs with the ASCO-VF and ESMO-MCBS based on
data from the pivotal clinical trials submitted to the FDA for approval
and described in the FDA medical review (retrieved from Drugs@fda
website). Scores were assessed by one investigator and checked by a se-
cond one, with discrepancies resolved by a senior investigator.
Approval characteristics
We assessed whether the drug was granted with one of the five FDA pathways
and designations to expedite drug approval (orphan drug status, fast-track,
priority review, breakthrough designation and accelerated approval).
Drug prices
We re-used data from the DrugAbacus database to obtain the price of
drugs in three markets: US Medicare, US Veterans Health Administration
and the United Kingdom [11]. For drugs not listed in the DrugAbacus
database, we computed the cost in US Medicare terms by using publicly
available data and the same methods as used in the DrugAbacus database.
The primary analysis was pre-specified as using prices by the US Medicare
system because it had the fewest missing values.
Statistical analyses
The association between the clinical benefit of drugs and their character-
istics was tested by Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon and Fisher exact tests. We
investigated the relation with drug prices by simple linear regression.
P <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Number and characteristics of new drugs
From 2000 to 2015, the FDA approved 51 new drugs for treating
advanced solid tumors (supplementary Figure S1, available at

 of 6 October 2016 and thus were removed from our sample.
Furthermore, we could not assess the value of 11 drugs (23%)
because the pivotal trial was not a head-to-head RCT, had a non-
inferiority design or did not report one of the three endpoints
used in the value scales (OS, PFS and ORR). Thus, we analyzed
data for 37 drugs. The most frequent indications were colorectal
(N ¼ 6, 16%) and breast (N ¼ 6, 16%) cancers (supplementary
Table S1, available at Annals of Oncology online).
Clinical benefit of new drugs
By the ASCO-VF, the median NHB of drugs was 37 [interquartile
range 20–52; range 3.4–66.5] (supplementary Table S2, available
at Annals of Oncology online and Figure 1). The median treatment
effect score was 34 [interquartile range 23–42] and the median
toxicity score was -5 [-13 to -2]. Bonus points for a tail on PFS
curves were granted for 14 drugs (38%) and for OS curves for
four drugs (11%); for palliation symptoms for two drugs (5%);
and for improvement in QoL for four drugs (11%). No drugs
received bonus points for treatment-free interval. By the ESMO-
MCBS, five drugs (14%) were grade one (the lowest), nine (24%)
grade two, 10 (27%) grade three, 11 (30%) grade four and two
(5%) grade five (the highest). Thus, 13 drugs (35%) had a mean-
ingful clinical benefit (levels four and five). Toxicity assessment
downgraded the value for two drugs (5%) and upgraded it for
one drug (3%). Quality of life assessment downgraded the value
for four drugs (11%) and upgraded it for six drugs (16%). Results
of assessment of value for each drug are provided in Table 1.
Characteristics associated with drug clinical benefit
We found no differences in ASCO-VF scores by innovation de-
gree (first-in-class versus advance or addition to class: 37 versus
38, P ¼ 0.29); orphan status (38 versus 36, P ¼ 0.56); priority re-
view (37 versus 39, P ¼ 0.69); breakthrough designation (29 ver-
sus 52, P ¼ 0.24); accelerated approval (22 versus 40, P ¼ 0.13);
or fast-track (46 versus 34, P ¼ 0.15). The presence of a pharma-
cogenomic biomarker in the drug label where also not statistically
associated with drug value albeit drugs with a biomarker had a
median of 44 versus 31 for those without, P ¼ 0.06, supplemen
tary Figure S2, available at Annals of Oncology online. Results
were similar with ESMO-MCBS scores (supplementary Figure
S3, available at Annals of Oncology online).
Relation between price and value of drugs
We found no relation between ASCO-VF score and price as
determined by US Medicare [R2¼0, P ¼ 0.93] (Figure 2), nor
any relation between price and value whatever the scale used
(ASCO-VF or ESMO-MCBS) or system used to determine the
price (US Medicare, US Veterans Health Administration or
United Kingdom).

 meaningful clinical benefit according to the ESMO-MCBS; (ii)
drug price and clinical benefit were not related by the two scales
and the three pricing systems; and (iii) drug clinical benefit was
not associated with any drug characteristics. Especially, we found
no significant difference for personalized medicine drugs and
first-in-class drugs.
Our results are consistent with a recent review finding that
only 31% of drugs examined in published randomized controlled
trials of four cancers (breast, colorectal, non-small cell lung and
pancreas) had meaningful clinical benefit according to the
ESMO-MCBS [10]. Another recent overview of clinical trials sup-
porting FDA-approval cancer drugs (new drugs or new indica-
tions) from April 2014 to February 2016 found that half met the
ASCO-VF meaningful goals for future clinical trials for PFS and
one fifth for OS [12].
The absence of a price–clinical benefit relation could be theoret-
ically surprising. However, our results agree with previous studies
[13]. Clinical benefit was not assessable for 20% of drugs mainly
because the drugs were approved on the basis of a single-arm trial.
This situation is not rare in oncology, especially for orphan drugs
[14], so assessing clinical benefit in this situation is highly prob-
lematic—at least at the time of marketing authorization.
The ASCO-VF and the ESMO-MCBS yielded some discrepan-
cies which are not surprising given the differences in their con-
struction and their somewhat different goals. The ASCO-VF is
more patient-oriented and was developed to ‘assist in facilitating

 shared decision-making with patients about clinical benefits and
costs,’ [7, 8] whereas the ESMO-MCBS is more societal-oriented
and was developed to ‘frame the appropriate use of limited public
and personal resources to deliver cost-effective and affordable
cancer care’ [9]. Especially, the ESMO-MCBS uses the primary
endpoint (often PFS), whereas the ASCO-VF uses OS if reported.
However, in many cases OS was not usable to score drugs because
of cross-over from experimental to control arm or because the
OS were not enough mature at the time of approval. This echoes
the difficulties to choose OS as a primary endpoint in many
advanced cancer settings.
Our study encompasses a large period of time and used two
validated scales, including the 2016 update of the ASCO-VF.
However, it has some limitations. First, defining the exact clinical
benefit of a drug is complex [15]. In this study, we used two scales
that were previously tested and validated by various stakeholders
and international experts and our results were similar whatever
the scale used. The assessment of value depends on accurate re-
porting and analysis of clinical trial data. Notably, treatment ef-
fects have been found greater in published trials than in FDA
documents [16]. In this study, we used FDA documents as the
primary source of data to limit reporting biases. The benefit of a
drug refers to a benefit averaged over all patients being treated
but it is well known that treatment effects are heterogeneous and
some patients could derive a great benefit from a drug with a low
value score.
Determining the price of a drug is complex because different
prices are available depending on the country and even within the
US depending on the entity that purchases the drug. Furthermore,
there is only limited transparency in drug pricing because the pri-
ces available usually do not account for managed-entry agreements
or other discounts granted to buyers by drug manufacturers
(which are not known to the public). In our study, we used two
countries and three different pricing systems, including one with
negotiated prices (US Veterans Health Administration). Because
the results of our analyses did not depend on the choice of pricing
system, we are confident that this limitation did not impact our
study.
The clinical benefit score of drugs is dynamic by nature as
acknowledged by the ASCO [8] because of different reasons:
a. Within a trial, efficacy results (especially OS results) could
and will evolve with time as more events occur;
b. As new clinical trials are conducted, the pooled estimate of
efficacy results will also evolve;
c. A drug could have subsequent supplemental approvals for
new indications, each one being associated with a different
magnitude of clinical benefit compared with its original indi-
cation. This point is precisely the central argument for hav-
ing an indication-specific price of drugs [5].
Here, we focused on the first indication of new drugs and eval-
uated the clinical benefit based on data submitted for approval

 because this reflects the entry into the market. How this benefit
evolves over time and with possible new indications is of interest
but is out of the scope of our study. Recently, a live cumulative
network meta-analysis was proposed to reflect an up-to-date
summary of trial evidence for a given indication [17]. Similarly,
the clinical benefit of a drug is relative to the control and evolves
with time as more evidence and more alternatives are available.
ESMO has planned to score all new drugs approved after 1
January 2016 [18] and this could be incorporated in a live cumu-
lative assessment of drugs clinical benefit.
Conclusion
Patients, clinicians and policy-makers are involved in a salient de-
bate on the clinical benefit, price and value of drugs. Regarding
the evidence for new cancer drugs, the bar has been dropping
[19], which has been justified by the high benefit of new drugs.
We showed, however, that the price of drugs was not related to
their benefit to society and patients.
