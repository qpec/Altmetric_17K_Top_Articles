Background
Non-specific low back pain (LBP) is a common condition. It is reported to be a major health and socioeconomic problem associated
with work absenteeism, disability and high costs for patients and society. Exercise is a modestly effective treatment for chronic LBP
.
However, current evidence suggests that no single form of exercise is superior to another. Among the most commonly used exercise
interventions is motor control exercise (MCE). MCE intervention focuses on the activation of the deep trunk muscles and targets the
restoration of control and co-ordination of these muscles, progressing to more complex and functional tasks integrating the activation
of deep and global trunk muscles. While there are previous systematic reviews of the effectiveness of MCE, recently published trials
justify an updated systematic review.
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness of MCE in patients with chronic non-specific LBP
.
Search methods
We conducted electronic searches in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, five other databases and two trials registers from their inception
up to April 2015. We also performed citation tracking and searched the reference lists of reviews and eligible trials.
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the effectiveness of MCE in patients with chronic non-specific LBP
.
We included trials comparing MCE with no treatment, another treatment or that added MCE as a supplement to other interventions.
Primary outcomes were pain intensity and disability. We considered function, quality of life, return to work or recurrence as secondary
outcomes. All outcomes must have been measured with a valid and reliable instrument.

 Data collection and analysis
Two independent review authors screened the search results, assessed risk of bias and extracted the data. A third independent review
author resolved any disagreement. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Back and Neck (CBN) Review Group expanded 12-
item criteria. We extracted mean scores, standard deviations and sample sizes from the included trials, and if this information was not
provided we calculated or estimated them using methods recommended in the Cochrane Handbook. We also contacted the authors of
the trials for any missing or unclear information. We considered the following time points: short-term (less than three months after
randomisation); intermediate (at least three months but less than 12 months after randomisation); and long-term (12 months or more
after randomisation) follow-up. We assessed heterogeneity by visual inspection of the forest plots, and by calculating the Chi2 test and
the I2 statistic. We combined results in a meta-analysis expressed as mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). We
assessed the overall quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.
Main results
We included 29 trials (n = 2431) in this review. The study sample sizes ranged from 20 to 323 participants. We considered a total of
76.6% of the included trials to have a low risk of bias, representing 86% of all participants. There is low to high quality evidence that
MCE is not clinically more effective than other exercises for all follow-up periods and outcomes tested. When compared with minimal
intervention, there is low to moderate quality evidence that MCE is effective for improving pain at short, intermediate and long-term
follow-up with medium effect sizes (long-term, MD -12.97; 95% CI -18.51 to -7.42). There was also a clinically important difference
for the outcomes function and global impression of recovery compared with minimal intervention. There is moderate to high quality
evidence that there is no clinically important difference between MCE and manual therapy for all follow-up periods and outcomes
tested. Finally, there is very low to low quality evidence that MCE is clinically more effective than exercise and electrophysical agents
(EPA) for pain, disability, global impression of recovery and quality of life with medium to large effect sizes (pain at short term, MD -
30.18; 95% CI -35.32 to -25.05). Minor or no adverse events were reported in the included trials.
Authors’ conclusions
There is very low to moderate quality evidence that MCE has a clinically important effect compared with a minimal intervention for
chronic low back pain. There is very low to low quality evidence that MCE has a clinically important effect compared with exercise
plus EPA. There is moderate to high quality evidence that MCE provides similar outcomes to manual therapies and low to moderate
quality evidence that it provides similar outcomes to other forms of exercises. Given the evidence that MCE is not superior to other
forms of exercise, the choice of exercise for chronic LBP should probably depend on patient or therapist preferences, therapist training,
costs and safety.

Motor control exercise for chronic non-specific low-back pain
Review question
To evaluate the effectiveness of motor control exercise (MCE) in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain (LBP).
Background
Motor control exercise is a popular form of exercise that aims to restore co-ordinated and efficient use of the muscles that control and
support the spine. Patients are initially guided by a therapist to practise normal use of the muscles during simple tasks. As the patient’s
skill increases the exercises are progressed to more complex and functional tasks involving the muscles of the trunk and limbs.
Search date
The evidence is current to April 2015.
Study characteristics
In total, 2431 participants were enrolled in 29 trials. The study sample sizes ranged from 20 to 323 participants, and most of them
were middle-aged people recruited from primary or tertiary care. The duration of the treatment programmes ranged from 20 days to
12 weeks, and the number of treatment sessions ranged from one to five sessions per week. Sixteen trials compared MCE with other
types of exercises, seven trials compared MCE with minimal intervention, five trials compared MCE with manual therapy, three trials

 compared MCE with a combination of exercise and electrophysical agents, and one trial compared MCE with telerehabilitation based
on home exercises.
Key results and quality of evidence
MCE probably provides better improvements in pain, function and global impression of recovery than minimal intervention at all
follow-up periods. MCE may provide slightly better improvements than exercise and electrophysical agents for pain, disability, global
impression of recovery and the physical component of quality of life in the short and intermediate term. There is probably little or
no difference between MCE and manual therapy for all outcomes and follow-up periods. Little or no difference is observed between
MCE and other forms of exercise. Given the minimal evidence that MCE is superior to other forms of exercise, the choice of exercise
for chronic LBP should probably depend on patient or therapist preferences, therapist training, costs and safety.

Motor control exercise for chronic non-specific low-back pain (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 B A C K G R O U N D
Low back pain (LBP) is one of the most common conditions
worldwide. It has been reported as a major health and socioeco-
nomic problem associated with work absenteeism, disability and
high costs for patients, governments and health insurance com-
panies (Airaksinen 2006; Dagenais 2008). Despite its high preva-
lence, the source of pain is not established in the majority of cases
and the term ’non-specific LBP’ is widely used (Hancock 2007;
Niemisto 2004; Niemisto 2005; Panjabi 2003).
One proposed mechanism for non-specific LBP is lack of stability
of the spine (Panjabi 1992; Panjabi 2003; Panjabi 2006). Previous
studies have demonstrated that patients with LBP may have im-
pairments in the control of the deep trunk muscles (e.g. transver-
sus abdominis and multifidus) responsible for maintaining the co-
ordination and stability of the spine (Hodges 1997; Hodges 1998;
Moseley 2002a). Based on this principle, motor control exercise
(MCE) was developed with the aim of restoring the co-ordina-
tion, control and capacity of the trunk muscles (Hodges 2003).
The intervention involves the training of isolated contraction of
the deep trunk muscles, with further integration of these muscles
into more complex static, dynamic and functional tasks (Ferreira
2007; O’Sullivan 1997). The intervention also includes the co-
ordination and optimal control of the global trunk muscles (Costa
2009; Macedo 2012).
The effectiveness of MCE has been tested in randomised con-
trolled trials and summarised in systematic reviews (Bystrom
2013; Costa 2009; Ferreira 2007; Lomond 2015; Macedo 2012;
Rasmussen-Barr 2009; Wang 2012a). Our aim was to perform the
first Cochrane systematic review on this topic in order to provide
accurate and robust information on the effectiveness of MCE for
chronic non-specific LBP
, as compared to no intervention or other
types of interventions.
Description of the condition
LBP is defined as pain and discomfort located below the ribs
and above the gluteal crease, with or without referred leg pain
(Airaksinen 2006; van Tulder 2006). Non-specific LBP has been
reported as the most common type of LBP and is defined as LBP
not attributed to a recognisable or specific pathology, such as nerve
root compromise or serious spinal pathology (i.e. fracture, cancer
and inflammatory diseases) (Airaksinen 2006; van Tulder 2006).
Chronic LBP is usually defined as an episode of LBP lasting for
12 weeks or longer (Airaksinen 2006). Patients with acute non-
specific LBP demonstrate a favourable improvement rate within
the first six weeks (Menezes Costa 2012); however, approximately
40% of patients will develop chronic LBP (Menezes Costa 2009).
Description of the intervention
MCE is based on the theory that the stability and control of the
spine are altered in patients with LBP (Hodges 1996). The inter-
vention focuses on the activation of the deep trunk muscles, target-
ing the restoration of control and co-ordination of these muscles,
which involves the training of pre-activation of the deep trunk
muscles with progression toward more complex and functional
tasks integrating the activation of deep and global trunk muscles
(O’Sullivan 1997). MCE is usually delivered in 1:1 supervised
treatment sessions, and sometimes involves ultrasound imaging,
the use of pressure biofeedback units or palpation to provide feed-
back on the activation of trunk muscles (Macedo 2012; Teyhen
2005).
During the intervention, patients are taught how to contract trunk
muscles in a specific manner (Costa 2009; Ferreira 2007), and
progress until they are able to maintain isolated contractions of
the target muscles while maintaining normal respiration. Over-
activation of the superficial trunk muscles is also identified and
corrected as part of the intervention. The advanced stage of the
treatment includes the progression of the exercises toward more
functional activities (Costa 2009), starting with static activities
and progressing to dynamic and more complex tasks. During this
process, the recruitment of the trunk muscles, posture, movement
patterns and breathing are assessed and corrected.
MCE is a complex intervention; however, reports of randomised
controlled trials do not always completely follow all the principles
previously described in their interventions (Macedo 2009). Trials
often include the training or control of the co-ordination of deep
muscles in the intervention but do not always take into consider-
ation the principles of motor learning or the progression to more
functional activities (Macedo 2012). For this reason, the interven-
tion can also be described as specific stabilisation exercises, and
not necessarily MCE.
How the intervention might work
Previous studies have demonstrated that patients with LBP may
have a delayed onset of activity of the deep trunk muscles in dy-
namic tasks that challenge the control of the spine (Hodges 1998;
Hodges 1999). Morphologically, a lower cross-sectional area and
a larger percentage of intramuscular fat in the multifidus muscle
were found in patients with LBP compared with asymptomatic
controls in cross-sectional studies (Alaranta 1993; Hides 1994).
Moreover, it was found that patients with low back pain tend to
increase spinal stiffness to compensate for the lack of control of
the spine by increasing the activity of the superficial muscles (van
Dieen 2003). MCE uses the motor learning approach to optimise
control of the spine by rehabilitating the posture, movement and
the co-ordination of the deep muscles of the spine (Richardson
2004). Thus, by correcting the co-ordination and control of the
spine, this intervention may be able to decrease pain as well as

 symptoms associated with LBP
.
Why it is important to do this review
The number of studies on MCE has increased as well as its pop-
ularity and use in clinical practice. There are recent published
trials that have not been included in other reviews (e.g. Moon
2013; Rabin 2014). Further, the systematic reviews available on
this topic are out of date, did not perform meta-analysis or did not
include an evaluation of the strength of the evidence, such as the
GRADE approach. Thus, a well-conducted Cochrane systematic
review with meta-analysis is important to better inform clinicians,
patients and policy makers about the effectiveness of MCE in pa-
tients with chronic non-specific LBP
.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We only included randomised controlled trials. We did not con-
sider trials with quasi-random allocation procedures for this re-
view.
Types of participants
We included studies if they explicitly reported that a criterion for
entry was chronic (> 12 weeks) non-specific LBP (with or with-
out leg pain) or recurrent LBP
. We excluded studies that included
individuals with specific conditions such as disc herniation, spinal
stenosis, cancer etc. We included studies evaluating adults of ei-
ther gender. We planned a secondary analysis of patients with
chronic and recurrent LBP if we were able to retrieve information
on whether patients had chronic LBP (first time onset) versus re-
current LBP (defined as pain lasting at least 24 hours, following a
30-day pain-free period following a previous episode).
We included trials with a mixed population in relation to type
and duration of back pain only if separate data for each group
were provided or if the majority of patients had chronic LBP (>
75%). In cases where articles did not include enough information
to classify patients as having non-specific LBP or the duration of
the pain, we contacted the authors to clarify. If no response was
received within one month, with bi-weekly emails, we excluded
and adequately referenced the study.
Types of interventions
We included trials comparing MCE with placebo, no treatment,
another active treatment, or when MCE was added as a supple-
ment to other interventions. When MCE was used in addition
to other treatments, it had to represent at least 50% of the total
treatment programme to be included.
We considered trials to have evaluated MCE if the exercise treat-
ment was described as motor control or specific stabilisation exer-
cise, and/or the trial described exercise aiming to activate, train or
restore the function of specific muscles of the spine, such as mul-
tifidus and transversus abdominis. We considered specific stabil-
isation exercises and exercises aiming to activate, train, or restore
the stabilisation or co-ordination of specific deep muscles because
these principles integrate the MCE intervention. As reports of tri-
als do not always take into consideration the principles of motor
learning, the intervention is often described as specific stabilisa-
tion exercises, instead of MCE. Articles were not included if gen-
eralised (whole body) stability exercises without consideration of
specific muscle activity were performed.
A Cochrane review of Pilates was recently published (Yamato
2015), therefore we excluded trials evaluating Pilates from this re-
view although principles of Pilates may overlap with the principles
of a motor control intervention.
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes were pain intensity and disability and the sec-
ondary outcomes were function, quality of life, global impression
of recovery, return to work, adverse events and recurrence. All out-
comes must have been measured with a valid and reliable instru-
ment.

We conducted searches in 2012 and 2014. For the 2015 update,
we added a search of MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-In-
dexed Citations and PubMed, using the strategy by Duffy 2014,
to capture studies not yet in MEDLINE.
We used the search strategies developed by the Cochrane Back and
Neck Review Group. We did not restrict the searches or inclu-
sion criteria to any specific language. The search strategy for each
database is presented in Appendix 1.
Searching other resources
We performed citation tracking using Web of Science (Thomson
Reuters) and also performed a manual search of the reference lists
of previous reviews and the eligible trials.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Two independent review authors (LGM and LC or BTS and TPY)
screened all search results for potentially eligible studies. A third
independent review author (RO or CM) resolved any disagree-
ment about inclusion of trials, quality assessment and data extrac-
tion. For non-English language manuscripts, we identified a native
speaker within local universities to assist with the translation. We
performed pilot testing of the assessment of risk of bias and the ex-
traction of data with two studies as recommended by the Cochrane
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011).
Data extraction and management
We extracted data from each included study using a standard-
ised extraction form. Two independent review authors (BTS and
TPY) extracted all data. We resolved disagreements through dis-
cussion or arbitration by a third review author (CM). We extracted
mean scores, standard deviations and sample sizes from the stud-
ies. When this information was not provided in the trial, we calcu-
lated or estimated the values using methods recommended in the
Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins
2011). We also extracted information about characteristics of par-
ticipants, treatments provided, co-interventions, duration of the
treatment, outcome measures and risk of bias criteria from the
studies.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Back and Neck Review
Group expanded 12-item criteria (Appendix 2) (Furlan 2009;
Higgins 2011). We assessed the risk of bias of a trial as ’low risk’
(at least six of the 12 criteria met) to ’high risk’ (fewer than six
criteria met). Two independent review authors (BTS and TPY)
extracted all data. We resolved disagreements through discussion
or arbitration by a third review author (CM). For the purpose of
this review, we did not consider the assessor blinded when patients
were not blinded, since the patient is considered to be the outcome
assessor for patient-reported outcomes such as pain, disability or
function.
Measures of treatment effect
We expressed pooled effects of continuous variables as mean dif-
ferences if the same outcomes were used. If continuous outcomes
measures were different between studies, we also expressed pooled
effects with mean differences (MD), but we first converted the dif-
ferent outcome measures to a common 0 to 100 scale. We used risk
ratios (RR) and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence interval
(CI) to calculate treatment effects of dichotomous variables. We
converted ordinal variables if present to dichotomous variables for
the purpose of the analysis. For the measurement of effect sizes,
we defined three levels: small effect size (MD < 10% of the scale),
medium effect size (MD 10% to 20% of the scale) or large effect
size (MD > 20% of the scale) (Rubinstein 2012). A clinically im-
portant effect was considered when the magnitude of the effect
size was at least medium (>10% of the scale).
Unit of analysis issues
If trials were sufficiently homogenous we conducted a meta-anal-
ysis for the time points: short (less than three months after ran-
domisation), intermediate (at least three months but less than 12
months after randomisation) and long-term (12 months or more
after randomisation) follow-up. When there were multiple time
points that fell within the same category we used the one that was
closest to the end of the treatment, six months and 12 months. Fi-
nally, we used intention-to-treat analysis preferably over per-pro-
tocol or as-treated analysis.
Dealing with missing data
When not enough information was provided in the trial to eval-
uate treatment effects, we contacted authors to provide the re-
quired information. We estimated data from graphs and figures in
cases where this information was not presented in tables or text. If
any information regarding standard deviations is missing, we cal-
culated them from confidence intervals (if available) of the same
study. Finally, if no measure of variability was presented anywhere
in the text, we estimated the standard deviation from the most
8

 similar trial, taking patient profile and the risk of bias of individual
studies into consideration.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We performed a visual inspection of the forest plot looking at the
overlap of the confidence intervals to evaluate heterogeneity. Fur-
thermore, we calculated the Chi2 test and I2 statistic as recom-
mended by theCochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Inter-
ventions (Higgins 2011). We defined substantial heterogeneity as
I2 > 50%, and described results in the text qualitatively and did
not pool them. When I2 values were slightly higher than 50%
but we identified no clear heterogeneity by visual inspection, we
combined the results into a meta-analysis using a random-effects
model and downgraded the evidence for inconsistency in the qual-
ity of evidence assessment.
Data synthesis
Regardless of whether there were sufficient data available to use
quantitative analyses to summarise the data, we assessed the over-
all quality of the evidence for each outcome. To accomplish this,
we used the GRADE approach, as recommended in the Cochrane
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011),
and adapted in the updated CBN method guidelines (Furlan
2015). The quality of the evidence was based upon five main
domains and for each domain that was not met we reduced the
quality by one level from high quality to moderate, low or very
low quality. The five domains are: 1) study design and risk of
bias (downgraded if > 25% of the participants were from studies
with a high risk of bias); 2) inconsistency of results (downgraded
if significant heterogeneity was presented by visual inspection or
I² > 50%); 3) indirectness (generalisability of the findings; down-
graded if > 50% of the participants were outside the target group);
4) imprecision (downgraded if fewer than 400 participants were
included in the comparison for continuous data and there were
fewer than 300 events for dichotomous data (Mueller 2007)); and
5) other (for example publication bias). We considered single stud-
ies with fewer than 400 participants for continuous outcomes (or
fewer than 300 participants for dichotomous outcomes) inconsis-
tent and imprecise, providing ’low quality evidence’, which could
be downgraded to ’very low quality evidence’ if there were further
limitations on the quality of evidence (Rubinstein 2012). We de-
scribed the quality of the evidence as follows (Balshem 2011):
• High quality evidence: there are consistent findings among
at least 75% of RCTs with no limitations of the study design,
consistent, direct and precise data and no known or suspected
publication biases. We are very confident that the true effect lies
close to that of the estimate of the effect.
• Moderate quality evidence: one of the domains is not met.
We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: the true
effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is
a possibility that it is substantially different.
• Low quality evidence: two of the domains are not met. Our
confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be
substantially different from the estimate of the effect.
• Very low quality evidence: three of the domains are not
met. We have very little confidence in the effect estimate: the
true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate
of effect.
• No evidence: no RCTs were identified that addressed this
outcome.
We also presented the results using the ’Summary of findings’ ta-
bles following the recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook
for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011), and the
GRADE guidelines (Guyatt 2013). We selected the primary out-
comes (pain and disability) and adverse events to include in the
main findings of this review.
Sensitivity analysis
We planned to perform a secondary analysis to evaluate separately
the studies using a more strict definition of MCE (Macedo 2012):
“Motor control exercises utilise the principles of motor learning to
retrain control of the trunk muscles, posture, and movement pat-
tern…”. There are three essential components to be considered as
motor control (must have all three to be considered in this defini-
tion): (1) assessment of the individual participant’s motor control
impairment; (2) an assessment of the postures, movements pat-
terns and muscle activation associated with symptoms and imple-
mentation of a retraining programme designed to improve activity
of muscles assessed to have poor control; and (3) the use of one or
more principles of motor learning (e.g. feedback, segmentation,
simplification). We also performed sensitivity analyses to assess the
influence of the methodological quality (i.e. trials fulfilling six or
more risk of bias criteria) on the overall estimates of effectiveness
for the primary outcomes. We conducted the sensitivity analysis
for the comparisons that included trials with high risk of bias.

 The searches for ongoing and unpublished trials retrieved 17
registered trials and 2 published protocols. One registered trial
and one protocol were from the same trial (ISRCTN80064281;
Saner 2011). Four registered trials were for trials already in-
cluded in this review (Akbari 2008; Franca 2010; Lomond
2015; Unsgaard-Tondel 2010), one was ineligible as both
groups received MCE (NCT01061632), three were not con-
sidered as MCE (ACTRN12609000293268; NCT00624533;
ISRCTN80064281), and one included a mix of MCE and man-
ual therapy in the intervention group and was not included
(ACTRN12609000334202). We contacted the authors of eight
trials but they did not yet have any results or published ma-
terial (ACTRN12609000343202; ACTRN12611000971932;
Magalhaes
2013;
NCT02398760;
NCT02170753;
NCT02374970; NCT02221609; NCT02200913), and for one
trial the authors did not reply to our email contact attempts for
more information (NCT02112760).
The 29 trials included in this review were conducted in 16 dif-
ferent countries: four trials were conducted in Iran (Akbari 2008;
Hemmati 2011; Hosseinifar 2013; Javadian 2012), four in the
United Kingdom (Cairns 2006; Critchley 2007; Goldby 2006;
Koumantakis 2005), three in India (Inani 2013; Kumar 2009;
Kumar 2010), three in Australia (Costa 2009; Ferreira 2007;
Macedo 2012), one in Norway (Unsgaard-Tondel 2010), two in
Sweden (Rasmussen-Barr 2003; Rasmussen-Barr 2009), one in
Brazil (Franca 2010), two in Korea (Moon 2013; Rhee 2012), one
in Thailand (Puntumetakul 2013), two in the USA (Miller 2005;
Lomond 2015), and one in each of Ireland (Shaughnessy 2004),
Serbia (Stankovic 2012), Taiwan (Tsauo 2009), Kingdom of South
Arabia (Kachanathu 2012), Turkey (Alp 2014), and Israel (Rabin
2014). All trials were published in English.
Included studies
In total, 2431 participants were enrolled in 29 trials (33 records).
The studysample sizesrangedfrom20to323participants(median
(interquartile range - IQR) = 42 (77.0)). From the 33 reports,
we included 29 trials in this review as three studies had three
publications with the same participant data, so we used the main
trial publication (Unsgaard-Tondel 2010). Another study was an
interim report of a subset of participants as confirmed by the
authors, and so we only included the article reporting the results
from all participants (Puntumetakul 2013). Finally, one report was
a duplicate publication of an earlier trial report (Franca 2010), so
we only included the first publication.
Three trials in this review reported implausibly small values for
standard deviations that were markedly different to the values re-
ported in other trials (Inani 2013; Javadian 2012; Kachanathu
2012). As there were insufficient data in the reports to calculate
the standard deviations we attempted to contact the authors, but
were unsuccessful. We therefore elected to estimate the standard
deviation for these trials from the median of the reported stan-
dard deviations for the trials included in the same comparisons.
In addition, one trial reported results as median and range (Alp
2014); thus we considered the median as mean and estimated the
standard deviation from the P values, difference between groups,
or range.
Types of studies
In total, 16 trials compared MCE with other types of exercises
that included: general or conventional exercises (Akbari 2008;
Cairns 2006; Critchley 2007; Ferreira 2007; Inani 2013; Javadian
2012; Koumantakis 2005; Unsgaard-Tondel 2010); stretching
and/or strengthening exercises (Franca 2010; Kachanathu 2012;
Stankovic 2012); McKenzie (Hosseinifar 2013; Miller2005); lum-
bar dynamic exercises (Moon 2013); graded activity (Macedo
2012); and movement system impairment treatment (Lomond
2015). Seven trials compared MCE with minimal intervention,
which included a placebo physiotherapy intervention (Costa
2009), education or advice (Goldby 2006; Rasmussen-Barr 2009;
Rhee 2012), and no treatment (Hemmati 2011; Shaughnessy
2004; Tsauo 2009). Five trials compared MCE with manual ther-
apy (Critchley 2007; Ferreira 2007; Goldby 2006; Rabin 2014;
Rasmussen-Barr 2003); and three trials compared MCE with a
combination of exercise and electrophysical agents (EPA) that in-
cluded the use of ultrasound, short-wave diathermy and strength-
ening exercises in two trials (Kumar 2009; Kumar 2010), and heat
and active stretching in other trial (Puntumetakul 2013). One trial
compared MCE with telerehabilitation based on home exercises
with phone calls twice a week (Alp 2014). Three trials had mul-
tiple arms (Critchley 2007; Ferreira 2007; Goldby 2006), and we
included both arms since it was for different comparisons.
Study population
Most participants in the included trials were middle-aged (median
(IQR) = 40.9 (11.2) years), ranging from 20.8 to 54.8 years and
recruited from primary or tertiary care with chronic LBP (LBP
persisting for 12 weeks or more). Two trials also included patients
with recurrent LBP (Koumantakis 2005; Rasmussen-Barr 2003).
One trial only included patients with clinical instability as indi-
cated by the instability catch sign (Puntumetakul 2013), one trial
only included patients with an aberrant trunk movement pattern
(Javadian 2012), one trial only included patients with mechani-
cally induced LBP (Rasmussen-Barr 2009), one only included a
population of professional fast bowlers (Kachanathu 2012), and
one only included male hockey players (Kumar 2009).

 T
echnique: number and duration of treatments
The duration of the treatment programmes ranged from 20 days
to 12 weeks (median (IQR) = 8 (2.0) weeks), with a median of
12 sessions (IQR: 6.0), ranging from one to five sessions per week
during the treatment programmes. The shortest session duration
was 20 minutes and the longest was 90 minutes (median (IQR)
= 45 (30) minutes). One trial did not provide information about
the programme duration, sessions or frequency (Javadian 2012).
Primary outcomes
Pain intensity: all included trials measured pain intensity, except
for one (Shaughnessy 2004). Pain was measured with a visual
analogue scale (VAS) or numerical rating scale (NRS) in all trials.
We converted all pain outcomes to a 0 to 100-point scale.
Disability: 13 trials measured disability using the Oswestry Dis-
ability Index (Franca 2010; Hemmati 2011; Inani 2013; Javadian
2012; Kachanathu 2012; Lomond 2015; Moon 2013; Rasmussen-
Barr 2003; Rasmussen-Barr 2009; Rhee 2012; Stankovic 2012;
Tsauo 2009; Unsgaard-Tondel 2010). Nine trials used the Roland
Morris Disability Questionnaire (Alp 2014; Cairns 2006; Costa
2009; Critchley 2007; Ferreira 2007; Koumantakis 2005; Macedo
2012; Puntumetakul 2013; Shaughnessy 2004), one trial used the
Functional Rating Index Questionnaire (FRI) (Hosseinifar 2013),
and one used the modified Oswestry Disability Index (MODI)
(Rabin 2014). We converted all disability outcomes to a 0 to 100-
point scale.
Secondary outcomes
Function: four trials measured function (Costa 2009; Ferreira
2007; Macedo 2012; Miller 2005). Three trials used the Patient
Specific Functional Scale (Costa 2009; Ferreira 2007; Macedo
2012), and one trial used the Functional Status Questionnaire
(Miller 2005).
Global impression of recovery: four trials measured global impres-
sion of recovery using the Global Perceived Effect Scale (Costa
2009; Ferreira 2007; Macedo 2012; Moon 2013). We used this
scale without conversion. The Global Perceived Effect Scale is an
11-point scale ranging from -5 (“vastly worse”) to 0 (“no change”)
and to +5 (“completely recovered”).
Quality of life: seven trials measured quality of life. Five trials
used the SF-36 questionnaire (Alp 2014; Cairns 2006; Macedo
2012; Puntumetakul 2013; Rasmussen-Barr 2009); one used The
Nottingham Health Profile (Goldby2006), and the other one used
the EQ-5D (EuroQoL) questionnaire (Critchley 2007). However,
only the overall score, for both the Nottingham Health Profile and
the EQ-5D (EuroQoL) questionnaire was provided, which is not
comparable with the physical and mental component of the SF-
36, which were the only domains included in this comparison.
Adverse events: seven trials attempted to evaluate adverse events
(Costa 2009; Critchley 2007; Ferreira 2007; Franca 2010; Kumar
2009; Macedo 2012; Unsgaard-Tondel 2010).
Follow-up
Twenty trials included measurements of at least one outcome for
short-term follow-up, ranging from 4 to 10 weeks. Fourteen trials
measured intermediate follow-up, from three to six months; and
nine trials measured long-term follow-up, which varied from 12 to
36 months. Only five trials included measures of short, intermedi-
ate and long-term follow-up (Costa 2009; Ferreira 2007; Macedo
2012; Rasmussen-Barr 2003; Rasmussen-Barr 2009).
Excluded studies
In total, we excluded 148 studies throughout the full-text analysis.
A total of 71 studies were not MCE or were a mix of interventions
(Ali 2006; Ammar 2011; Andrusaitis 2011; Aasa 2015; Bentsen

tients with acute LBP (Aluko 2013; Brennan 2006; Hides 1996;
Hides 2001), in four all groups received MCE (Ahmed 2014;
Lewis 2005; Moseley 2003; Trampas 2014), three were confer-
ence abstracts for which repeated attempts to contact the authors
were unsuccessful (Bayraktar 2013; Carmo 2013; Meira 2013),
one was a conference abstract from a study already included in this
review (Alp 2014), and two studies did not evaluate any relevant
outcome for this review (Earde 2014; Javadian 2015). Finally, 19
were registered trials or protocols already discussed.

 Risk of bias in included studies
We considered a total of 76.6% of the included trials to have a
low risk of bias, representing 86% of all participants (n = 2088).
Overall risk of bias scores varied from 3 to 11, from a total of 12
points with a mean (SD) of 6.8 (1.93). Figure 2 and Figure 3 show
the results of the risk of bias analysis for the individual trials.

Allocation
Twenty-four trials met the criteria for adequate randomisation
and 13 for allocation concealment. In five trials the information
about the randomisation procedure was unclear or we did not
find sufficient data to judge (Javadian 2012; Kachanathu 2012;
Shaughnessy 2004; Stankovic 2012; Tsauo 2009). Fifteen trials
did not provide enough information regarding the allocation pro-
cedures (Akbari 2008; Alp 2014; Critchley 2007; Hemmati 2011;
Hosseinifar 2013; Inani 2013; Javadian 2012; Kachanathu 2012;
Kumar 2010; Miller 2005; Moon 2013; Rasmussen-Barr 2003;
Shaughnessy 2004; Stankovic 2012; Tsauo 2009).
Blinding
One trial blinded patients by providing a placebo treatment, and
then the outcome assessor was also considered blinded (Costa
2009). One trial reported that patients were blinded to the in-
tervention, so the assessor was also considered as blinded (Kumar
2010). A total of 14 trials attempted to blind the outcome assessor
(Akbari 2008; Alp 2014; Cairns 2006; Critchley 2007; Ferreira
2007; Franca 2010; Goldby 2006; Hosseinifar 2013; Lomond
2015; Macedo 2012; Moon 2013; Puntumetakul 2013; Rabin
2014; Tsauo 2009); however, as the patients were not blinded we
did not consider the assessors blinded as specified beforehand. We
also assumed that blinding of therapists was not possible for the
intervention evaluated and none of the included trials claimed that
the care providers were blinded.
Incomplete outcome data
In total, 15 trials provided adequate information about missing
data and kept this below 20% for short and intermediate-term,
or 30% for long-term outcomes (Akbari 2008; Alp 2014; Cairns
2006; Costa 2009; Ferreira 2007; Hosseinifar 2013; Inani 2013;
Kumar 2009; Lomond 2015; Macedo 2012; Miller 2005; Moon
2013; Puntumetakul 2013; Rasmussen-Barr 2009; Unsgaard-
Tondel 2010). Seven trials did not provide sufficient information
about missing data (Franca 2010; Hemmati 2011; Javadian 2012;
15

 Kachanathu 2012; Kumar 2010; Rhee 2012; Shaughnessy 2004).
One trial exceeded 20% of withdrawals (Rabin 2014), and six tri-
als exceeded 30% of withdrawals (Critchley 2007; Goldby 2006;
Koumantakis 2005; Rasmussen-Barr2003; Stankovic 2012; Tsauo
2009).
Selective reporting
Published protocols or registered trials were available for eight
trials in this review (Akbari 2008; Costa 2009; Critchley 2007;
Ferreira 2007; Franca 2010; Lomond 2015; Macedo 2012;
Unsgaard-Tondel 2010). Two trials, also published their protocols
(Costa 2009; Macedo 2012). We considered trials in which it was
not possible to find any registry record or publicly available re-
port, but for which it was clear that all expected outcomes were
included or were reported in a pre-specified way, to have fulfilled
this criterion. We considered all included trials at low risk of bias
for this criterion.
Other potential sources of bias
Publication bias: the examination of publication bias with funnel
plots was possible for only one comparison, MCE versus other
exercises, for pain and disability. We did not assess publication
bias for other comparisons because too few studies were included.
Figure 4 and Figure 5 show the funnel plots for the outcomes,
pain and disability, respectively. For both outcomes, it appears that
small trials with larger effect sizes favouring MCE are published
whilst trials favouring the control group are missing. This might
indicate publication bias.

Primary outcomes
In total, we included 16 trials in this comparison (Akbari
2008; Cairns 2006; Critchley 2007; Inani 2013; Ferreira 2007;
Franca 2010; Hosseinifar 2013; Javadian 2012; Kachanathu 2012;
Koumantakis 2005; Lomond 2015; Macedo 2012; Miller 2005;
Moon 2013; Stankovic 2012; Unsgaard-Tondel 2010); three
of them were at high risk of bias (n = 220) (Javadian 2012;
Kachanathu 2012; Stankovic 2012). For the outcome pain, there
is low quality evidence (downgraded due to risk of bias and pub-
lication bias) that there is a small, but not clinically important,
effect of motor control exercise (MCE) for reducing pain at short-
term (mean difference (MD) -7.53; 95% confidence interval (CI)
-10.54 to -4.52; P value < 0.001, 13 trials) compared with other
exercises, and high quality evidence that there is no clinically im-
portant difference for pain at intermediate (MD -2.98; 95% CI -
6.96 to 0.99, six trials) and long-term follow-up (MD -2.69; 95%
CI -6.90 to 1.53, five trials) (Analysis 1.1).
For disability, there is low quality evidence (downgraded due to
risk of bias and publication bias) that there is a small, but not
clinically important, effect on improving disability at short-term
follow-up (MD -4.82; 95% CI -6.95 to -2.68; P value < 0.001,
11 trials), and high quality evidence for no clinically important
difference at intermediate (MD -2.88; 95% CI -6.92 to 1.15, 10
trials) and long-term follow-up (MD -0.71; 95% CI -4.87 to 3.45,
four trials) (Analysis 1.2).
Secondary outcomes
For the outcome function, there is moderate quality evidence
(downgraded due to imprecision) that there is a small, but not
clinically important, effect of MCE for improving function at
17

 short-term follow-up (MD 7.29; 95% CI 1.53 to 13.04, P value =
0.01, three trials); however we cannot discard an important effect
for function as the CI includes a clinically important value. For
intermediate term follow-up, there is moderate quality evidence
(downgraded due to imprecision) that there is no clinically im-
portant difference between MCE and other exercises (MD 0.31;
95% CI -0.83 to 1.44, two trials) and low quality evidence (down-
graded due to imprecision and inconsistency) for long-term fol-
low-up (MD 0.52; 95% CI -1.36 to 2.41, two trials) (Analysis
1.3).
For global impression of recovery, there is moderate quality evi-
dence (downgraded due to imprecision) that there is no clinically
important difference at intermediate (MD 0.30; 95% CI -0.22 to
0.82, two trials) and long-term follow-up (MD 0.53; 95% CI -
0.03 to 1.08, two trials) (Analysis 1.4). We did not pool results
for short-term follow-up due to high heterogeneity; however, the
two studies included in this comparison did not report a clinically
important difference.
For the physical component of quality of life, there is low quality
evidence (downgraded due to inconsistency and imprecision) that
there is no clinically important difference at short (MD 0.00; 95%
CI -3.80 to 3.80, one trial) and intermediate-term follow-up (MD
1.40; 95% CI -2.61 to 5.41, one trial), and there is moderate
quality evidence (downgraded due to imprecision) that there is no
clinically important difference at long-term follow-up (MD 0.08;
95% CI -3.14 to 3.30, two trials) (Analysis 1.5). For the mental
health component of quality of life, there is low quality evidence
(downgraded due to inconsistency and imprecision) that there is
no clinically important difference at short (MD 0.20; 95% CI
-3.39 to 3.79, one trial) and intermediate-term follow-up (MD
-2.00; 95% CI -5.32 to 1.32, one trial), and moderate quality
evidence of a non-significant effect at long-term follow-up (MD
-0.75; 95% CI -3.33 to 1.83, two trials) (Analysis 1.6)..
Five trials attempted to evaluate adverse events for this compari-
son (Critchley 2007; Ferreira 2007; Franca 2010; Macedo 2012;
Unsgaard-Tondel 2010). Three trials did not report any adverse
events related to the intervention or control groups (Critchley
2007; Ferreira 2007; Franca 2010). One trial reported mild ad-
verse events for 19 participants in the MCE group and 17 par-
ticipants in the graded activity group (Macedo 2012). Another
trial reported one adverse event in the MCE group, which was a
withdrawal from the study (Unsgaard-Tondel 2010).
Sensitivity analysis
The pooled effect sizes for low risk of bias trials were of similar
magnitude to the main comparison for pain and disability. The es-
timates of this sensitivity analysis seem to be precise and consistent
since the confidence intervals around the estimates are narrow and
no clear heterogeneity was present. Overall, the inclusion of high
risk of bias studies in the analyses does not appear to overestimate
the effect of MCE versus other exercise.
Effect of motor control exercise versus manual
therapy
See: Summary of findings 2.
Primary outcomes
We included a total of five trials with low risk of bias in the
meta-analysis(Critchley2007; Ferreira2007; Goldby2006; Rabin
2014; Rasmussen-Barr 2003). For the outcome pain, there is mod-
erate quality evidence (downgraded due to imprecision) that there
is no clinically important effect of MCE compared to manual
therapy at short (MD -4.36; 95% CI -9.52 to 0.81; P value =
0.10, three trials) and intermediate-term follow-up (MD -7.05;
95% CI -14.20 to 0.11; P value = 0.05, four trials), and there is
high quality evidence for long-term follow-up (MD -3.67; 95%
CI -9.28 to 1.94, four trials) (Analysis 2.1). We cannot discard an
important effect for pain at intermediate term as the confidence
interval includes a clinically important effect.
For disability, there is moderate quality evidence (downgraded due
to imprecision) that there is no clinically important difference at
short-term follow-up (MD -2.79; 95% CI -6.60 to 1.02, three
trials), and high quality evidence for intermediate (MD -3.28;
95% CI -6.97 to 0.40, four trials) and long-term follow-up (MD
-3.40; 95% CI -7.87 to 1.07, four trials) (Analysis 2.2).
Secondary outcomes
Based on low quality evidence (downgraded due to inconsistency
and imprecision) from one trial, there is no clinically important
difference between MCE and manual therapy for the outcome
function (short-term, MD 0.20; 95% CI -1.82 to 2.22; interme-
diate-term, MD -0.90; 95% CI -3.01 to 1.21; long-term, MD
0.50; 95% CI -1.61 to 2.61) (Analysis 2.3), and global impression
of recovery (short-term, MD 0.50; 95% CI -0.12 to 1.12; inter-
mediate-term, MD 0.20; 95% CI -0.58 to 0.98; long-term, MD
0.60; 95% CI -0.24 to 1.44) (Analysis 2.4). Two trials attempted
to evaluate adverse events for this comparison, but none were re-
ported (Critchley 2007; Ferreira 2007).
Sensitivity analysis
The pooled effect sizes for low risk of bias trials were similar to
the main comparison for pain and disability in that there is no
difference in treatment estimates between MCE and manual ther-
apy. The estimates of this sensitivity analysis seem precise and con-
sistent; therefore the inclusion of high risk of bias studies in this
analysis does not appear to overestimate the effects of MCE.

Motor control exercise for chronic non-specific low-back pain (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Primary outcomes
We included seven trials in the meta-analysis for this comparison
(Costa 2009; Goldby 2006; Hemmati 2011; Rasmussen-Barr
2009; Rhee2012; Shaughnessy 2004; Tsauo 2009); twoof them(n
= 66) with a high risk of bias (Shaughnessy 2004; Tsauo 2009). For
the outcome pain, there is moderate quality evidence (downgraded
due to imprecision) that there is a clinically important effect of
MCE for reducing pain with medium effect size at short-term
(MD -10.01; 95% CI -15.67 to -4.35; P value < 0.001, four
trials) and long-term follow-up (MD -12.97; 95% CI -18.51 to -
7.42; P value < 0.001, three trials). There is low quality evidence
(downgraded due to inconsistency and imprecision) for a clinically
important effect in favour of MCE in the intermediate term, with
a medium effect size (MD -12.61; 95% CI -20.53 to -4.69; P
value = 0.002, four trials) (Analysis 3.1).
For disability, there is very low quality evidence (downgraded due
to risk of bias, inconsistency and imprecision) that there is a small,
but not clinically important, effect on MCE for improving dis-
ability at short-term follow-up (MD -8.63; 95% CI -14.78 to -
2.47; P value < 0.01, five trials); however we cannot discard an
important effect as the confidence interval includes a clinically
important effect.There is moderate quality evidence (downgraded
due to imprecision) that there is no clinically important effect at
intermediate (MD -5.47; 95% CI -9.17 to -1.77; P value = 0.004,
four trials) and long-term follow-up (MD -5.96; 95% CI -9.81 to
-2.11; P value = 0.002, three trials), with small effect sizes (Analysis
3.2).
Secondary outcomes
There is low quality evidence (downgraded due to inconsistency
and imprecision) based on one trial that there is a clinically impor-
tant effect of MCE for improving function with medium effect
size (short-term, MD 1.10; 95% CI 0.36 to 1.84, P value = 0.004;
intermediate-term, MD 1.00; 95% CI 0.16 to 1.84, P value =
0.02; long-term, MD 1.50; 95% CI 0.68 to 2.32, P value < 0.001)
(Analysis 3.3), and global impression of recovery with medium
effect size (short-term, MD 1.30; 95% CI 0.30 to 2.30, P value =
0.01; intermediate-term, MD 1.20; 95% CI 0.31 to 2.09, P value
= 0.008; long-term, MD 1.50; 95% CI 0.61 to 2.39, P value <
0.001) (Analysis 3.4). One trial reported that five patients (three
from the MCE group and two from the minimal intervention
group) had mild adverse effects during the study (all temporary
exacerbations of pain) (Costa 2009). None of the patients with-
drew from the trial due to adverse events.
Sensitivity analysis
The pooled effect sizes for low risk of bias trials were of similar
magnitude to those in the main comparison for pain in the short
and intermediate term. For disability, the effect estimate for short-
term follow-up was of similar magnitude. The effect estimate for
intermediate-term follow-up was no longer statistically significant;
however, it may be explained by the reduced precision since fewer
trials were included. Overall, inclusion of high risk of bias trials
in this comparison did not appear to result in a bias due to effect
overestimation.
Effect of motor control exercise versus combination
of exercise and electrophysical agents (EPA)
See: Summary of findings 4.
Primary outcomes
We included three trials with low risk of bias in the meta-analysis
for this comparison (Kumar 2009; Kumar 2010; Puntumetakul
2013). The treatment programme included in this comparison
comprises a combination of ultrasound, short-wave diathermy and
lumbar strengthening exercises in two trials (Kumar 2009; Kumar
2010), and active trunk stretching exercises plus heat application
in another trial (Puntumetakul 2013).
There is low quality evidence (downgraded due to imprecision and
indirectness) that there is a clinically important effect of MCE for
reducing pain at short-term follow-up compared with exercise and
electrophysical agents (EPA), with a large effect size (MD -30.18;
95% CI -35.32 to -25.05, P value < 0.001, two trials) (Analysis
4.1). We did not pool results for intermediate-term follow-up due
to high heterogeneity, but these are presented descriptively. Two
studies reported a clinically important difference in favour of MCE
compared with exercise and EPA, with very low quality evidence
for this comparison (downgraded due to inconsistency, impreci-
sion and indirectness).
For disability, based on one trial and very low quality evidence
(downgraded due to imprecision, indirectness and inconsistency)
there isaclinicallyimportanteffectinfavourof MCEatshort-term
follow-up with large effect size (MD -20.83; 95% CI -28.07 to -
13.59, P value < 0.001) and there is low quality evidence (down-
graded due to inconsistency and imprecision) for an intermediate-
term effect, with medium effect size (MD -11.50; 95% CI -20.69
to -2.31, P value = 0.01, one trial) (Analysis 4.2).
Secondary outcomes
For global impression of recovery, there is low quality evidence
(downgraded due to inconsistency and imprecision) of a clinically
important effect in favour of MCE at short-term (MD 1.85; 95%
CI 1.09 to 2.61, P value < 0.001, one trial) and intermediate-
term follow-up (MD 1.67; 95% CI 0.89 to 2.45, P value < 0.001,
one trial), with medium effect sizes (Analysis 4.3). For the phys-
ical component of quality of life, there is low quality evidence
(downgraded due to inconsistency and imprecision) that there is
a small, but not clinically important, effect at short-term (MD
8.40; 95% CI 2.68 to 14.12, P value < 0.01, one trial) and inter-
mediate-term follow-up (MD 8.0; 95% CI 2.25 to 13.75, P value

 < 0.01, one trial); however we cannot discard an important effect
as the CI includes a clinically important effect (Analysis 4.4). For
the mental component of quality of life, there is low quality ev-
idence (downgraded due to inconsistency and imprecision) that
there is no clinically important difference at short-term (MD 2.48;
95% CI -2.17 to 7.13, one trial) and intermediate-term follow-up
(MD 1.64; 95% CI -2.95 to 6.23, one trial) (Analysis 4.5). One
trial attempted to evaluate adverse events, but none were reported
(Kumar 2009).
Effect of motor control exercise versus
telerehabilitation
One trial with low risk of bias compared MCE with telerehabilita-
tion, which included home exercises with phone calls twice a week
for six weeks (Alp 2014). Based on very low quality evidence, there
is no clinically important difference between MCE and telereha-
bilitation for intermediate term pain (MD -10.00; 95% CI -32.35
to 12.35), disability (MD 12.50; 95% CI -16.38 to 41.38) and
the metal and physical component of quality of life (MD 0.00;
95% CI -9.05 to 9.05, and MD -5.00; 95% CI -16.32 to 6.32,
respectively).

Motor control exercise for chronic non-specific low-back pain (Review)

Summary of main results
In general, for the outcomes pain and disability there is low quality
evidence that there is a small, but not clinically important, effect
of motor control exercise (MCE) compared to other exercises in
the short term and high quality evidence that there is no clinically
important difference for intermediate and long term follow-ups.
There is low to moderate quality evidence that there is a clinically
important effect of MCE for reducing pain compared with mini-
mal intervention at all follow-up periods, and there is very low to
moderate quality evidence that there is a small, but not clinically
important, effect of MCE compared with minimal intervention
for all follow-up periods. There is moderate to high quality evi-
dence of no clinically important difference in the effect of MCE
compared to manual therapy at all follow-up periods for pain and
disability. There is very low to low quality evidence that there is a
clinically important difference between MCE and electrophysical
agents (EPA) in the short and intermediate term for pain and dis-
ability. MCE showed a clinically important effect when compared
with minimal intervention and exercise and EPA for the other sec-
ondary outcomes investigated, except for the mental component
of quality of life for exercise and EPA. There was no clinically
important difference in the effect of MCE compared with other
exercises and manual therapy for the secondary outcomes. Addi-
tionally, all the results were consistent with a sensitivity analysis of
high quality trials, which suggests that low quality trials did not
overestimate the effects of MCE.
These results are unexpected to some extent because we did not
expect that the effect of MCE versus exercise and EPA would be
much greater than MCE versus minimal intervention. One ex-
planation may be that the combination of exercise and EPA is
harmful, which seems unlikely. It is perhaps more likely that these
results might be explained by the small sample sizes and limita-
tions in the trials’ designs for this comparison since, according to
GRADE, very low to low quality evidence indicates that the true
effect may be or is very likely to be substantially different from
the estimate of the effect. Additionally, it was unclear how much
care was taken in implementing both the comparison treatments
and MCE in the included studies, since most of the treatment
protocols were very briefly described. This also prevents us from
performing a sensitivity analysis between stricter and broader def-
initions of MCE and other interventions.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
The studies included in this review were undertaken in 16 dif-
ferent countries from Oceania, South America, Europe and Asia.
Most participants were middle-aged adults recruited from pri-
mary or tertiary care with non-specific chronic LBP
. Two stud-
ies included participants with recurrent LBP (Koumantakis 2005;
Rasmussen-Barr 2003). The treatment was delivered by an expe-
rienced physiotherapist in more than 80% of the trials. There was
small variability in the population included, but we do not believe
that it would affect the generalisability of the findings. One study
included a sample of hockey players (Kumar 2009), one study in-
cludedonlypatientswith clinical instability(Puntumetakul 2013),
one study included fast bowlers (Kachanathu 2012), and one study
included only patients with aberrant movement pattern (Javadian
2012).
Quality of the evidence
In this review, we classified most studies included as having low risk
of bias although half of the studies scored between 6 and 7, which
is just over the limit previously defined. To explore any potential
bias from low quality studies we performed a sensitivity analysis
with trials classified as high quality and it seems that the inclusion
of low quality trials did not introduce bias due to over-estimation
or under-estimation of the effect estimates. Regarding the quality
of the extracted data, we extracted final scores or change scores,
depending on which form was available. We also calculated change
scores when groups were different at baseline. The assessment of
the evidence through GRADEvariedfromverylowtohigh quality,
and the most downgraded points were due to inconsistency and
imprecision, that is related to high heterogeneity and insufficient
pooledsample size.Although there were concernsaboutthe quality
of evidence for some outcomes, we are confident of our findings
for the primary outcomes as for most comparisons we had at least
moderate quality evidence.
Potential biases in the review process
A limitation of this review is the presence of publication bias in
the comparisons assessed with funnel plots. However, for most
comparisons it was not possible to assess publication bias using
the funnel plots as too few studies were included; thus we did
not include or downgrade publication bias with GRADE for these
comparisons. We do not have data from three conference abstracts
as all attempts to contact the authors regarding the full-text article
were unsuccessful; thus this may also potentially indicate publica-
tion bias.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
Inthisreview, we didnotfindaclinicallyimportanteffectforMCE

27

 version of this review (Macedo 2009) and the most recent sys-
tematic review on the topic (Bystrom 2013) that reported a small
effect size, which was not considered clinically important in this
review. For disability, we found a small effect size but not clinically
important in the short term similar to that reported by a previous
review (Wang 2012a). The recent review Bystrom 2013 reported
a statistically significant effect on disability favouring MCE for all
time periods compared to general exercise. This small divergence
from our results may be explained because this previous review
only included general exercise in this comparison, while we con-
sidered all types of exercises other than MCE.
For the comparison of MCE with manual therapy, we did not
find any clinically important differences for pain and disability
although most treatment effects were in favour of MCE, which
is partially consistent with the review of Bystrom 2013 that did
not find differences for pain but reported an effect of MCE for
disability with a small effect size. Moreover, the previous version
of this review reported a small effect size of MCE for pain and
disability in the intermediate term (Macedo 2009).
When comparing MCE with minimal intervention, we found a
clinically important effect in favour of MCE for pain for all time
periods, with medium effect sizes, which is consistent with the
findings of Bystrom 2013, and the previous version of this review
(Macedo 2009). For the comparison of MCE with exercise and
EPA, one previous review included a similar comparison, named
as multimodal physical therapy (Bystrom 2013). Our results were
consistent in reporting a clinically important effect in favour of
MCE for pain and disability in the short and intermediate term,
although based on low or very low quality evidence in this review.
The slight discrepancy of results compared to other reviews may
be explained by the number of trials included in these previous
reviews. The previous reviews, Bystrom 2013, Macedo 2009 and
Wang 2012a, included 16, 14 and five trials respectively, while we
were able to include 29 trials in our review, with a total of 2431
participants.

Implications for practice
Although the quality of evidence varied among the outcomes and
time periodinvestigated, ourfindingsdemonstrate thatthere islow
to moderate quality evidence that motor control exercise (MCE)
is more effective than a minimal intervention for chronic low back
pain. There is very low to low quality evidence that MCE is more
effective than exercise plus EPA. We are uncertain about the effec-
tiveness of MCE compared to exercise and EPA as we considered
the quality of the evidence low or very low. We did not find a
clinically important difference between MCE and manual ther-
apy for any of the outcomes investigated, with moderate to high
quality evidence. There is low quality evidence that there is no
clinically important difference between MCE and other forms of
exercise in terms of pain and disability in the short term. As MCE
appears to be a safe form of exercise and none of the other types
of exercise stands out, the choice of exercise for chronic low back
pain should depend on patient or therapist preferences, therapist
training, costs and safety.
Implications for research
Future randomised controlled trials in chronic non-specific low
back pain should include more complete descriptions of the ex-
ercise interventions so that interpretation of the results would be
more transparent. We strongly recommend that future trials have
adequate sample size as most of the trials in this review are con-
sidered small (fewer than 50 participants). Trials including cost-
effectiveness analysis and long-term outcomes are also needed in
this area. The effectiveness of motor control exercise should be
also tested in target groups, such as subgroups of patients more
likely to respond to this treatment approach (Macedo 2014).

Akbari 2008
Methods
Randomised controlled trial
Participants
58 participants included (29 motor control, 29 general exercise)
Inclusion criteria: patients were selected based on the following inclusion criteria: non-
specific LBP with or without leg pain of at least 3 months duration, aged greater than 18
and less than 80 years, suitable for motor control exercise based on clinical assessment.
The patients must also have sufficient knowledge of the Persian language to understand
instructions
Exclusion criteria: patients were excluded if they had suspected or confirmed serious spinal
pathology, suspected or confirmed pregnancy, nerve root compromise (2 of strength, re-
flex or sensation affected for same nerve root), spinal surgery, and any of the contraindi-
cations to exercise listed on page 42 of the ACSM guidelines. Specific spinal pathology
or contraindication to treatment may be suspected based on the results of the screening
questionnaires
Interventions
16 individually supervised half-hour sessions of an exercise programme, of 8 weeks
duration, 2 sessions per week, was performed for both groups in Razmejo-Moghadam
Physiotherapy Clinic
Motor control exercise: low-load activation of the local stabilising muscles was initially
administered, isometrically and in minimally loaded positions (4-point kneeling, supine
lying, sitting, standing). Patients were taught how to contract these muscles indepen-
dently from the superficial trunk muscles. Progressively, the holding time was increased
to the point where patients were able to perform 10 contractions with 10-second holds,
during normal respiration (weeks 1 and 2). The clinical measure used to ensure correct
activation of the TA was to observe a slight drawing in manoeuvre of the lower part
of the anterior abdominal wall below the umbilical level, consistent with the action of
this muscle. In addition, a bulging action of the multifidus muscle should have been felt
under the physical therapist’s fingers when they were placed on either side of the spinous
processes of the L4 and L5 vertebral levels, directly over the belly of this muscle
General exercise: this exercise activates paravertebral and abdominal muscles. This exercise
imposes extra loading on the spinal tissues, therefore the general exercise was selected
on the basis of maximising the contraction benefit/spinal loading ratio, according to the
recommendations provided from recent experimental studies

Interventions
Stabilisation exercise (SE): patients in the SE group (n = 24) joined a supervised (physio-
therapist) group exercise programme 3 times a week and for a duration of 6 weeks. The
lumbar stabilisation exercise programme consisted of warming (5 minutes), stretching
(5 minutes), stabilisation exercises for the multifidus/transversus abdominis muscles (30
minutes) and cooling (5 minutes), for a total of 45 to 60 minutes a day
Home-based exercise (HE): patients in the HE group (n = 24) were instructed to do lumbar
isometric and lumbar flexion-extension exercises, 1 x 20 repetitions a day for 6 weeks
(standardised home-based exercise programme for LBP patients given in the outpatient
unit), and their adherence to the programme was checked by telephone calls twice a
week

Methods
Randomised controlled trial
Participants
97 patients between 18 and 60 years old were included (47 spinal stabilisation, 50
conventional treatment)
Inclusion criteria: patients with LBP
, with or without radiating leg pain, aged between
18 and 60 years, who had had a minimum of 1 previous episode of LBP necessitating
alteration in normal activities or for which medical care/intervention had been sought
Exclusion criteria: evidence of cauda equina compression, non-mechanical LBP
, clini-
cal presentations suggestive of acute objective motor radiculopathy or nerve root com-
pression, with new or progressive neurologic loss, abdominal surgery within the last 12
months, any spinal surgery, systemic illness, neurologic or muscular degenerative disor-
der, pregnancy or less than 1 year postpartum, psychologic distress (Distress Risk Assess-
ment Method Distressed Depressed or Distressed Somatic)
Interventions
Patients received a maximum of 12 treatment sessions over 12 weeks. No restriction was
placed on prescribed or over-the-counter medication. The same physiotherapists deliv-
ered both interventions. Details of the content and number of sessions were recorded.
Hydrotherapy, back school or other group therapy was prohibited. There were 10 senior
physiotherapists, with a minimum of 4 years since qualification and 3 years specialisation
in musculoskeletal care, that delivered both treatment packages. To achieve appropriate
expertise, all were experienced in stabilisation training, having undertaken recognised
postgraduate training courses, and 3 training days as part of the trial, including the use
of diagnostic ultrasound to identify correct muscular activation patterns. Both groups
received standardised educational information based on the best available evidence re-
garding continuing normal activities and avoiding rest (The Back Book). The 2 groups
received manual and exercise treatments currently used within UK clinical practice. The
protocol allowed treatment to be adapted to individual patient needs, with therapists
able to select from a range of techniques
Specific spinal stabilisation exercise: endurance training for the deep abdominal and back
extensor muscles was the predominant component of this treatment group. A treatment
manual for clinicians outlined appropriate exercise progression, but treatment was indi-
vidualised at the discretion of the clinician. A patient booklet was developed to emphasise
the specific nature of the exercises, outlining anatomy and function of the muscles and
the concept of endurance training. Diagnostic ultrasound was available at the discretion
of the treating clinician for patients in the stabilisation groups if needed. The majority
of patients received manual therapy, such as Maitland mobilisations, exercise and advice,
with little use of electrotherapy or mechanical lumbar traction
Conventional treatment: exercises using low load, high repetition muscle activity were
excluded. All participating departments had adopted an active approach to back pain

Methods
Randomised controlled trial
Participants
154 patients (77 exercise group, 77 placebo group)
Inclusion criteria: participants had to have non-specific low back pain (defined as pain
and discomfort) localised below the costal margin and above the inferior gluteal folds,
with or without referred leg pain of at least 3 months’ duration; be currently seeking
care for low back pain; be aged between 18 and 80 years; comprehend English; and
expect to continue residing in the study region for the study duration. In addition,
potential participants underwent a simple trunk muscle test to determine that motor
control exercise treatment was indicated
Exclusion criteria: suspected or confirmed spinal pathology (e.g. tumour, infection, frac-
ture, inflammatory disease), pregnancy, nerve root compromise, previous spinal surgery,
major surgery scheduled during treatment or follow-up period, and presence of any con-
traindication to exercise, ultrasound or shortwave therapy
Interventions
Participants in each group received 12 half-hour treatments over an 8-week period (2
sessions per week in the 1st month and 1 session per week in the 2nd month). Both
interventions were provided by 3 senior physical therapists who received training from
experts in motor control exercise and placebo interventions. This training included a
1-day workshop prior to the commencement of the study and 3 half day follow-up
sessions during the trial period. Random audits and regular meetings provided by the
same experts were conducted during the trial to monitor delivery of interventions. No
deviations from the treatment protocol were observed during the audits
Exercise group: at the 1st session, participants were comprehensively assessed by the phys-
ical therapist, who prescribed exercises that were individualised based on the participant’s
presentation. The exercises were designed to improve function of specific muscles of the
low back region and control of posture and movement. The motor control exercise pro-
gramme involved 2 stages. Each participant was progressed through the stages according
to specific criteria that should be met in each stage. The 2 stages and their main objectives
were: Stage 1 - Train co-ordinated activity of the trunk muscles, including independent
activation of the deeper muscles (including transversus abdominis and multifidus) and
reduce overactivity of specific superficial muscles in an individualised manner. Stage 2 -
Implement precision of the desired co-ordination and train these skills in static tasks and
incorporate them into dynamic tasks and functional positions. Stage 1 of the exercise
45

programme involved retraining of the multifidus and transversus abdominis muscles.
These exercises were supplemented with exercises for the pelvic floor muscles, breathing
control, and control of spinal posture and movement. The specific muscles that were
trained depended on the initial assessment. Participants were taught how to contract
these muscles independently from the superficial trunk muscles. Physical therapists used
real-time ultrasound biofeedback to enhance learning of the tasks. The exercises were
progressed until the patient was able to maintain isolated contractions of the target mus-
cles for 10 repetitions of 10 seconds each while maintaining normal respiration. When
this level of competence was achieved, patients were considered ready to progress to stage
2. Stage 2 of the exercise programme involved increasing the complexity of the exercise by
progressing through a range of functional tasks and exercises targeting co-ordination of
trunk and limb movement, maintenance of optimal trunk stability, and improvement of
posture and movement patterns. Participants required the ongoing support of a trained
physical therapist to ensure correct performance of the exercises. The participants were
instructed to perform a daily set of home exercises. These exercises were performed at
the same level and in the same position as those demonstrated during the treatment
session. Session 12 was a discharge session in which the patient’s progress was reviewed
and exercises were prescribed to be continued at home
Placebo group: the placebo treatment was designed to be structurally equivalent to the ac-
tive intervention, providing similar contact time with the physical therapist. The placebo
intervention consisted of 20 minutes of detuned shortwave diathermy and 5 minutes
of detuned ultrasound for 12 sessions over an 8-week period. This form of placebo was
used because the detuned machines do not provide a specific treatment effect, but it has
been established in previous trials that participants view this intervention as credible. To
ensure the perceived credibility of the placebo intervention, physical therapists followed
the usual clinical routine for the delivery of the active form of these 2 treatments (i.e. by
checking for contraindications, monitoring changes in symptoms, adjusting the detuned
devices and appearing to progress the treatment). Each placebo treatment session lasted
30 minutes to match the duration of active treatment sessions
Outcomes
Primary outcomes: pain intensity over the previous week (measured with a 0 to 10 nu-
meric rating scale (NRS), activity (measured with the 0 to 10 Patient-Specific Functional
Scale (PSFS)), and global impression of recovery (measured with the 5 to -5 Global Per-
ceived Effect Scale (GPE)). Secondary outcomes: pain intensity over the previous week,
activity (measured with the PSFS), patient’s global impression of recovery measured at
6 and 12 months, and activity limitation (measured with the 0 to 24 Roland-Morris
Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ)) at 2, 6 and 12 months

Methods
Randomised controlled trial
Participants
212 participants included (71 individual physiotherapy, 72 spinal stabilisation, 69 pain
management)
Inclusion criteria: LBP for more than 12 weeks duration, with or without leg symptoms
or neurologic signs; being 18 years of age or older; adequate command of English; ability
to give informed consent; and ability to attend classes
Exclusion criteria: people were excluded if they had previous spinal surgery, physiotherapy
for low back pain in the last 6 months, medical conditions such as rheumatological
diseases, or other disabilities rendering them unsuitable for group treatment of low back
pain
Interventions
All treating physiotherapists had at least 2 years clinical experience and were briefed
about and had agreed to treat according to the trial protocol. The hospitals had their
own common internal teaching programme for the leaders of the pain management
programme and spinal stabilisation training, but otherwise treating physiotherapists had
no extra training for the trial
Spinalstabilisation:the spinal stabilisationphysiotherapyconsistedof individual transver-
sus abdominis and lumbar multifidus muscle training followed by group exercises that
challenged spinal stability. Exercises were tailored to assessment findings and progressed
within participants’ ability to maintain a stable and minimally painful spine. The ex-
ercise programme aimed to improve trunk muscle motor control to provide dynamic
segmental stability for the lumbar spine
Individual physiotherapy: In the individual physiotherapy protocol, patients were assessed
and treated according to assessment findings. Treatment consisted of a combination of
joint mobilisations, joint manipulation and massage. Exercises were taught individually
to be performed at home and included specific trunk muscle retraining, stretches and
general spinal mobility. Patients usually also received back care advice. Up to 12 sessions
of around 30 minutes each were permitted in the protocol and according to departmental
policy
Pain management: the pain management programme consisted of a combination of
structured back pain education with group general strengthening, stretching and light
aerobic exercises progressed according to pacing principles. The programme consisted
of a maximum of 8 sessions of 90 minutes supervised by a senior physiotherapist and
physiotherapy assistant

Interventions
Participants attended for up to 12 treatment sessions over an 8-week period
Motor control: participants allocated to the motor control exercise group were prescribed
exercises aimed at improving function of specific trunk muscles thought to control in-
ter-segmental movement of the spine, including transversus abdominis, multifidus, the
diaphragm and pelvic floor muscles. Each participant was trained by a physical thera-
pist to recruit the deep muscles of the spine and reduce activity of other muscles. Ini-
tially participants were taught how to contract the transversus abdominis and multifidus
muscles in isolation from the more superficial trunk muscles, but in conjunction with
the pelvic floor muscles. Ultrasonography was used to provide feedback about muscle
recruitment, except where the therapist judged that ultrasound feedback would not be
useful (for example, if the patient was too obese). The difficulty of the tasks was pro-
gressed by incorporating more functional positions and training the co-ordination of all
trunk muscles during functional tasks in a manner that was tailored to the individual
patient’s presentation
General exercise: a physical therapist carried out an initial assessment of each participant
allocated to the general exercise group to determine how physically active the participant
was, how troublesome the back problem was and the ability of the participant to perform
the exercises. Participants were then taught the exercises and advised of the intensity
at which they should exercise. The exercises were performed under supervision of a
physical therapist in classes of up to 8 people with each class lasting approximately 1 hour.
The intensity of the exercises was progressed over the 12 treatments with participants
being encouraged to improve their own performance rather than competing with other
members of the class
Spinal manipulative: Participants allocated to the spinal manipulative therapy group
were treated with joint mobilisation or manipulation techniques applied to the spine
or pelvis. The particular dose and techniques were at the discretion of the treating
physical therapist, based on each participant’s physical examination findings. Participants
in this group were not given exercises or a home exercise programme, and they were
advised to avoid pain-aggravating activities. Manipulative therapy was discontinued if
the participant completely recovered before the 12 sessions were completed, as is standard
clinical practice

Interventions
Interventions were conducted over 6 weeks, twice per week, each session lasting 30
minutes. Sessions were supervised by the investigator, and participants were instructed
to report any adverse event, whether it was related to the exercises or not. Groups were
instructed not to participate in any other physical programme during the study and not
to exercise while at home. Three series of 15 repetitions were done for each exercise
Segmental stabilisation: in the segmental stabilisation (SS) group, exercises focused on
the transversus (TrA) and lumbar multifidus (LM) muscles according to the protocol
proposed by Richardson et al. Exercises for the TrA in 4 point kneeling, exercises for the
TrA in dorsal decubitus with flexed knees; exercises for the LM in ventral decubitus; co-
contraction of the TrA and LM in upright position
Superficial stretching: in the superficial strengthening (ST) group, exercises focused on
the rectus abdominis (RA), abdominus obliquus internus (OI), abdominus obliquus
externus (OE), and erector spinae (ES). Strengthening of the rectus abdominis (RA),
external and internal obliquus (EO and IO) and erector spinae (ES). Exercises for the
RA in dorsal decubitus with flexed knees: trunk flexion, exercises for the RA, IO and
EO in dorsal decubitus and flexed knees: trunk flexion and rotation, exercises for the
RA in dorsal decubitus and semi-flexed knees: hip flexion, exercises for the ES in ventral
decubitus: trunk extension

Methods
Randomised controlled trial
Participants
323 participants included
Inclusion criteria: all patients with chronic low back disorder referred to St. George
Hospital physiotherapy departments (2 sites) by his/her general practitioner or hospital
consultants were informed of the trial. All participants had chronic low back disorder,
with the current episode lasting for a minimum of 12 weeks, were aged between 18 and
65 years, and able to read and write English
Exclusion criteria: all patients with non-mechanical low back pain were excluded. Some
participants with mechanical pathology were excluded where evidence indicated that
they would benefit from alternative treatment, or if they had conditions that could
skew the data. Spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis grades III or IV, or recent fractures.
Significant or worsening signs of neurologic deficit. Evidence of inflammatory joint
disease. Lower limb pathology likely to influence leg pain intensity. Present or past history
of metastatic disease. Medically unsuitable for participation in the exercise class. Chronic
pain syndrome or a history of ≥ 2 operative interventions for low back pain. History of
anxiety neurosis. Pregnancy. Participants were withdrawn if they withdrew consent or
had exclusion criteria develop while participating
Interventions
There were 18 physiotherapists who performed the physiotherapy treatments. All had
a minimum of 5 years postgraduate experience in the treatment of chronic low back
disorders, and 60% held masters’ level qualifications in musculoskeletal physiotherapy.
All physiotherapists were instructed by the researcher in the prescription of exercises
to facilitate the stabilising muscles and the spinal stabilisation programme. The Back
School was provided for all groups and consisted of 1 group specific 3-hour question
and answer session. The class covered anatomy, biomechanics and lifting, pathologies,
and advice on education, exercise and general fitness
Spinal stabilisation: spinal stabilisation rehabilitation programme was developed aiming
to rehabilitate the neural control and active subsystems of the lumbar spine’s stabilising
system. The 10-week course was formulated in conjunction with clinical experts and the
available literature. It consisted of a functionally progressive exercise class that emphasised
53

the selective retraining of the transversus abdominis, multifidus, the pelvic floor and
diaphragm muscles, while inhibiting global muscle substitution mechanisms. A video
illustrating the effect of the muscles on the stability of the spine was shown at the
beginning and end of each class, between which the patients exercised at facilitation
stations. Each station consisted of exercises, which had been verified by the author using
ultrasonography to determine the action produced, that facilitated the contraction of the
stabilising muscles. The same 2 physiotherapists staffed each class, and a maximum of
12 patients attended at any time. After attending 10 x 1-hour classes, the patients were
discharged. All participants were booked to attend the Back School
Manual therapy: in group B, the physiotherapists continued to treat the patient according
to the diagnosis and clinical reasoning. They were not permitted to prescribe any exer-
cises for the transversus abdominis, multifidus, diaphragm or pelvic floor muscles. Nor
were they allowed to prescribe any electrophysical methods. Any other form of exercise
or manual procedure within the remit of musculoskeletal physiotherapy was allowed.
Patients were discharged at the discretion of the physiotherapist or to a maximum num-
ber of 10 interventions. All patients were booked to attend the Back School
Education: after being informed of the patient’s allocation, the physiotherapist explained
the contents of the educational booklet “Back in Action” to the patient. Patients were
then discharged and booked to attend the Back School. Because patients in all groups
attended the Back School, the independent variable in group C became the “Back in
Action” booklet. This booklet has shown the ineffectiveness in the treatment of patients
with chronic low back disorder and, as such, it formed the basis for establishing group
C as the control group

Stabilisation exercises: (1 hour, 18 sessions, 3 times per week, 6 weeks). For warming up
and before performing specific exercises, participants pedalled a stationary bike for 5
minutes and then did stretching exercises for 10 minutes). Stabilisation exercises were
divided into 6 levels from easy to difficult. At the end of each training level, participants
performed each exercise 10 times for 10 seconds with low intensity). The stabilisation
exercises were performed in 6 steps: 1) segmental control exercises (SCE) with emphasis
on training the of isolated contraction of the TrA, MF and pelvic floor muscles; 2) SCE
with emphasis on co-contractions of the TrA, MF and pelvic floor muscles in the prone,
supine and 4-point kneeling positions; 3) closed kinematic chain SCE; 4) development of
SCE into the low load apply by adding leverage of the limbs during open chain exercises;
5) development of SCE in functional situations; and 6) co-contraction of the TrA and MF
muscles during application of an external load, complication of movements, increased
load with the lumbar spine in the correct position, addition of a co-contraction pattern
to light aerobic activities such as walking, and activities that have already exacerbated
the symptoms)
McKenzie exercises: (1 hour, 18 sessions, 3 times per week, 6 weeks). During the treatment
session, between 80 and 100 repetitions of the selected exercises were carried out in
the McKenzie group. In the McKenzie group, 6 exercises were used: 4 extension-type
exercises and 2 flexion-type and 2 flexion-type exercises. The extension-type exercises
were performed in prone and standing positions, and the flexion-type exercises were
performed in the supine and sitting positions. The final position of each exercise was
maintained for 10 seconds

Methods
Randomised controlled trial
Participants
30 participants. The inclusion criteria were: age group 20 to 50 years, both sexes, diag-
nosed with non-specific low back pain
Interventions
Core stabilisation exercise: the treatment was given in 4 rehabilitation phases. Phase-I:
Activation phase: here patient was taught to cognitively perform skilled activation of
deep muscles i.e. transversus abdominis (TA) and lumbar multifidus (LM) alone while
relaxing the superficial muscle. Phase-II: Skill precision. Once the patients could per-
form independent contraction of local muscles (TA/LM) the next phase was to improve
precision of task. Phase-III: Superficial and deep muscle co-activation. Here, the partic-
ipants were asked to co-ordinate the activity of deep and superficial muscles without the
global muscle taking over. Fitness activities were given with closed and open chain ac-
tivities. Closed chain segmental control stage involves following procedure: (1) Training
individual part of the anti-gravity weight bearing holding postures. (2) Weight bearing
exercises in flexed postures. Open chain segmental control involves the exercises like
leg standing with hip flexion, extension and abduction, adduction in position such as
lying, side-lying, sitting or standing. Phase-IV: Functional re-education. It was subject-
specific training. The exercises in the experimental group were as follows. Before starting
with actual core exercises patients were asked to do warm up by performing stretching
exercises of tight muscles, isometric exercises of abdominals and back extensors of spine
for 10 times each:
- Transversus abdominis (TA) and lumbar multifidus (LM) exercises: according to 4
rehabilitation phases above explained were progressed. Few exercises which activate other

core muscles like quadratus lumborum, psoas major, lumbar portions of longissimus,
Iliocostalis responsible for dynamic stability of spine were given.
- Slow curl-ups: responsible for co-activation of transversus abdominis and rectus abdo-
minis. Patient in supine position, with hand under lumbar region (to help to stabilise
the pelvis and preserve the neutral spine posture) and with one leg bent and other leg
straight to assist in pelvic lumbar stabilisation; then the patient was instructed to raise
the head and shoulder off the ground
- Sit ups: activates the psoas muscle. Patient in supine position with knee bent, head and
shoulders are raised off the ground with hand under the head
- Oblique plank/side bridge: activates the quadratus lumborum and oblique muscle.
Patient is side-lying with knee bent/straight, then rising horizontally with support on
elbows and knee/legs
- Bird-dog exercises: activates back extensors (longissimus, Iliocostalis and multifidus)
Patient in quadruped position with elbow locked straight and head in neutral position.
Patient pulls in the belly button and lifts one leg off the floor so that the limb is in line
with the trunk and then the opposite side arm is lifted off the ground
Conventional exercise: the exercises in the control group were as follows: (1) Stretching
exercises: the muscles that were found to be tight during assessment were given static
stretching exercises. (2) Isometric exercises of spine:
- Hollowing in abdominals: participant supine position, lying with knee bent. Patients
were asked to slowly draw in the abdomen towards the spine (press down on towel placed
under lumber curve) without the movement of the trunk
- Isometric for back extensors: participant in supine position with arm at side. Participant
was instructed to arch the back by pressing against the mat with the back of neck and
sacrum

Methods
Randomised controlled trial
Participants
30 professional fast bowlers with chronic LBP were screened at sports complexes around
Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
Inclusion criteria: non-specific LBP with or without referred pain (of a non-radicular
nature) of at least 3 months with physiotherapy scheduled to start; average pain intensity
over the last 2 weeks ≥ 3 and ≤ 8 on a 0 to 10 visual analogue scale; minimal to moderate
disability score (0% to 40%) on the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire
(OLBPDO)
Exclusion criteria: abdominal surgery within the past 12 months, or a history of spinal or
limb surgery; systemic illness; neurological or muscular degenerative disorders; periph-
eral vascular disease; participants with body mass index of more than 27; participants
with central nervous system impairments; respiratory or cardiovascular impairment af-
fecting the perturbation trial; and prior participation in a programme of spine segmental
stabilisation exercises
Interventions
Both groups of patients were given back ergonomics care lessons, and a model demon-
stration of safe lifting techniques in back care classes during the 1st week of the inter-
vention. As commonly prescribed in Indian settings, 10 minutes of moist heat was also
given to both groups at the end of each session. An exercise session lasted approximately
45 minutes
Core stabilisation: (45 minutes, 14 sessions, 4 days per week, 8 weeks). A basic outline
of the various exercises for local and global muscles and the differences in their function
was given before the start of the programme. In group A, participants initially received
14 guided training sessions each lasting 45 minutes, which emphasised core muscle co-
contraction, 4 days a week. The 8-week treatment protocol was divided into 3 phases.
Each exercise was performed in 3 sets of 5 repetitions with 5 seconds hold time and 10
seconds rest between each repetition and a minutes rest in between each set. In the 1st
phase of the training, attention was focused on facilitating isolated local muscle activity
with emphasis on continuation of normal breathing. Subsequently, the hold time and
the number of repetitions were increased, and participants were trained to maintain these
contractions in various postures (4-point kneeling, supine, prone, sitting and standing).
Once an accurate and sustained contraction of the local muscles was achieved in different
postures (10% to 15% MVC, 10 contractions with 10-second holds), the exercises
progressed to the second phase, which involved applying low load to the muscles through
controlled movements of the upper and lower extremities. The main aim during the 3rd
phase was to integrate these low grade static contractions with normal static and dynamic
functional tasks so that these contractions became habitual
Conventional regimen: group B performed basic conventional physiotherapy strengthen-
ing exercises. The rate of perceived exertion was used to monitor the level of exertion
during strengthening exercises, and it ranged from 6 to 9, 10 to 15 and 16 to 20 in the

Motor control exercise for chronic non-specific low-back pain (Review)

 Koumantakis 2005
Methods
Randomised controlled trial
Participants
55 participants (29 stabilisation + general exercise, 26 general exercise). Patients were
recruited from the orthopaedic clinic of a local hospital and several general practitioners’
practices. Patients took part in the study after informed consent had been obtained. The
rights of human participants were protected at all times
Inclusion criteria: patients were eligible for the study if they had a history of recurrent
LBP (repeated episodes of pain in past year collectively lasting for less than 6 months)
of a non-specific nature, defined as back pain complaints occurring without identifiable
specific anatomical or neuro-physiological causative factors. To establish this, all patients
included in the trial had a prior clinical examination by their physician, including a
radiograph or a magnetic resonance imaging scan
Exclusion criteria: patients with previous spinal surgery, “red flags” (i.e. serious spinal
pathology or nerve root pain signs) as outlined in the Clinical Standards Advisory Group
(CSAG) report for back pain, or signs and symptoms of instability (radiological diag-
nosis of spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis corresponding to a symptomatic spinal level;
“catching”, “locking”, “giving way” or “a feeling of instability” in one direction or mul-
tiple directions of spinal movements) were excluded
Interventions
The same frequency (twice per week), programme duration (8 weeks) and class duration
(45 to 60 minutes per session) were provided for both groups. All participants received
an information booklet (The Back Book) providing the latest scientific facts on LBP
management at the beginning of the programme. The main aim of this booklet is to
change patient beliefs and behaviours regarding back pain. The clinical physical therapist
who administered the exercise sessions monitored class adherence, and participants were
required to keep an exercise diary monitoring home adherence. The number of sessions
in class environment and at home was recorded
Stabilisation + general exercise: 8 weeks, 2 times per week, 45 to 60 minutes per session.
Briefly, low-load activation of the local stabilising muscles was initially administered,
with no movement (isometric) and in minimally loaded positions (4-point kneeling,
supine lying, sitting, standing). Progressively, the holding time and then the number of
contractions were increased in those positions up to 10 contraction repetitions,10-second
duration each (weeks 1 and 2). The clinical measure used to ensure correct activation of
the transversus abdominis muscle was to observe a slight drawing-in manoeuvre of the
lower part of the anterior abdominal wall below the umbilical level, consistent with the
action of this muscle. In addition, a bulging action of the multifidus muscle should have
been felt under the clinical physical therapist’s fingers when they were placed on either
side of the spinous processes of the L4 and L5 vertebral levels, directly over the belly of this
muscle. Various facilitation techniques were used throughout the programme to draw
participants’ attentiontothe specificnature of the desiredmuscle contractions(tactile and
pressure cuesoverareasof the specificmuscles, auditorycuestoenhance theircontraction,
use of contraction of the pelvic-floor muscles). Furthermore, participants were made
aware of and were told to avoid several incorrect muscle activation (“substitution”)
strategies, where a movement muscle takes over the control of movement from the
stabilising muscles (too much effort causing unwanted spasms in the movement muscles
or spinal movement at the initial stages were discouraged). Integration with dynamic
function (activities that required spinal or limb movements) through incorporation of the
stabilising muscles’ co-contraction into light functional tasks was advised as soon as (1)
the specific pattern of co-activation was achieved in the minimally loading positions and

(2) the participants could comfortably perform 10 contraction repetitions x 10 seconds
duration each (weeks 3 to 5). Heavier-load functional tasks, with exercises similar to those
performed by the participants who performed general exercise only, were progressively
introduced in the last 3 weeks of the programme
General exercise: 8 weeks, 2 times per week, 45 to 60 minutes per session. For the partici-
pants who performed general exercise only, exercises activating the extensor (paraspinals)
and flexor (abdominals) muscle groups were administered. Muscle contraction occurring
with exercise imposes extra loading on the spinal tissues, therefore the general exercises
were selected on the basis of maximising the contraction benefit/spinal loading ratio,
according to recommendations provided from recent experimental studies

Methods
Randomised controlled trial
Participants
30 hockey players included
Inclusion criteria: male hockey players from Sports Authority of India (SAI), Lucknow,
aged 18 to 28 years, who were diagnosed clinically by a physician with no neurological
involvement but having symptomatic (overuse, overload or overstretching) non-specific
subacute or chronic low back pain
Exclusion criteria: no neurological involvement
Interventions
After group allocations, respective participants were treated either with conventional or
dynamic muscular stabilisation treatment. Both the treatments were given as individual
treatment by the same physiotherapist with the same intensity and capacity on alternate
day for 35 days. The duration of each individual treatment session was about 40 minutes
per day. The participants were not allowed to receive any other treatment, including pain
killers
Dynamic muscular stabilisation treatment (DMST): in DMST, muscles with direct attach-
ment to the lumbar spinal segment stabilise the joints “neutral zone” and prevent exces-
sive deflection. Exercise is given in 4 stages in the following order: (i) 1st week: isolation
and facilitation of target muscles. Verbal instruction such as drawing in and hollowing
the lower abdomen, drawing the naval up and in toward the spine, or feeling the muscle
tighten at the waist. From the beginning the patient learns to breathe normally while
activating or holding the muscular contraction. The patient is in supine hook lying posi-
tion and instructed to perform abdominal hollowing (in which the patient is instructed
to make the lower abdomen cave in) or abdominal bracing (in which the patient is in-
structed to contract the abdominals by actively flaring out laterally in the region of the
waist just above the iliac crest). (ii) 2nd week: training of trunk stabilisation under static
conditions of increased load. The patient’s position and concentration pattern are the
same as the first week; the individual is then asked to hold the position while load is
added via the weight of the lower limbs being moved passively into a loaded position.
(iii) 3rd week: development of trunk stabilisation during slow controlled movement
of the lumbar spine. Once stability is trained through static procedure, the movement
of the trunk will optimise the activation of the supporting muscle. The first step is to
produce and explore lumbopelvic movement and learn abdominal hollowing or bracing
66

in a variety of positions: sitting, quadruped, standing, supine, kneeling and inclination
by degree to control loading. (iv) 4th and 5th weeks: lumbar stabilisation during high-
speedandskilledmovement. High-speedphasicexercisesare recommendedtothe patient
along with abdominal hollowing or bracing in a variety of positions
Conventional treatment: ultrasound, short-wave diathermy (SWD) and lumber strength-
ening exercises. Ultrasound (US): for the purpose of this study as a treatment for a
chronic condition, a frequency of 1 MHz was used rather than 3 MHz, which penetrates
least and is absorbed superficially. Continuous pattern ultrasound is recommended for
use in chronic conditions at intensity 1.2 W/cm2 for a period of 8 minutes for 18 sit-
tings in 18 alternate days. Ultrasound equipment was used from Medichem Electronics,
which has international standard certification. Short-Wave Diathermy. SWD is a deep
heating modality used in relieving pain. It is also used to enhance flexibility and blood
flow and reduce inflammation. Short-wave forms are used for selected patients without
neurological lesion. Continuous mode of SWD is used for 15 minutes with 18 sittings
in 18 alternate days. The SWD was used from Medichem Electronics, which has in-
ternational standard certification. Lumbar strengthening exercises. The uses of lumbar
strengthening exercises (LSE) are well documented, including spinal extension exercises
and trunk extensor muscles exercises. LSEs were done for 10 repetitions each exercise
per sitting on alternate days

Methods
Randomised controlled trial
Participants
A total of 141 (male/female) LBP patients from Department of Physical Medicine and
Rehabilitation, CSM Medical University, Lucknow, aged 20 to 40 years who were di-
agnosed clinically by a physician with no neurological involvement, non-specific, sub-
acute or chronic low back pain were included in this study
Exclusion criteria: neurological involvement
Interventions
After group allocations, respective participants were treated either with conventional
(CONV)or dynamic muscular stabilisation treatment (DMST) in a single-blind manner
(i.e. patients were not aware of the treatment groups). Both the treatments were given as
individual treatments by the same physiotherapist with the same intensity and capacity
on 20 regular days and followed up for 180 days. Follow-up was started after 20 days
of regular exercises at OPD, which was ended after 6 months from the 0 day. During
follow-up, participants had an appointment periodically with the investigator at 15-day
intervals for review of exercises. The duration of each individual treatment session was
about 40 minutes per day. The participants were not allowed to get any other treatment
options including the pain killers
Dynamic muscular stabilisation treatment (DMST): in DMST, muscles with direct at-
tachment to the lumbar spinal segment stabilise the joint’s ’neutral zone’ and prevent
excessive deflection. Details of the DMST exercise programme are described elsewhere
Conventional treatment: consisted of ultrasound (1 MHz continuous at an intensity of
1.2 W per cm square for 5 minutes). Short-wave diathermy (continuous mode of SWD
for 15 minutes) and the lumbar strengthening exercises (10 repetitions each of prone
lying leg elevation, prone lying chest elevation and supine lying bridging). Participants
received 20 sitting in 20 regular days. Ultrasound and short-wave diathermy equipment
from Medichem Electronics were used in the study, which has international standard
certification

Methods
Randomised controlled trial
Participants
172 participants (86 motor control, 86 graded activity). Participants were recruited to
the trial by general practitioners in Sydney and Brisbane or drawn from the waiting list
of an outpatient physical therapy department from a public hospital in Sydney
Inclusion criteria: chronic non-specific low back pain (> 3 months duration) with or
without leg pain, currently seeking care for low back pain, between 18 and 80 years of
age, English speaker (to allow response to the questionnaires and communication with
the physical therapist), clinical assessment indicated that the patient was suitable for
active exercises expected to continue residing in the Sydney or Brisbane region for the
study duration, had a score of moderate or greater on question 7 (“How much bodily
pain have you had during the past week?”) or question 8 (“During the past week, how
much did pain interfere with your normal work, including both work outside the home
and housework?”) of the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey questionnaire (SF-36)
Exclusion criteria: known or suspected serious pathology such as nerve root compromise
(at least 2 of the following signs: weakness, reflex changes or sensation loss, associated
with the same spinal nerve), previous spinal surgery or scheduled for surgery during trial
period, comorbid health conditions that would prevent active participation in exercise
programmes. They used a “red flag” checklist to screen for serious pathology and the
Physical ActivityReadinessQuestionnaire fromthe AmericanCollege of SportsMedicine
guidelines to screen for comorbid health conditions that would prevent safe participation
in exercise
Interventions
Participants in each group were to receive 14 individually supervised sessions of approx-
imately 1 hour. The treatment consisted of 12 initial treatment sessions over an 8-week
period and 2 booster sessions at 4 and 10 months following randomisation. The initial 12
sessions were conducted twice a week for the first 4 weeks and once a week for the follow-
ing 4 weeks. The treatment sessions were designed to become less frequent and promote
independence. In order to facilitate adherence to treatment sessions and to be consistent
with clinical practice, if patients could not complete the initial 12 treatment sessions
within the first 8 weeks, they received an extension of another 4 weeks to complete the
71

12 treatment sessions. Patients included in both exercise programmes were advised to
do home exercises for at least half an hour per week in the first month and 1 hour per
week in the 2nd month. The type of home exercises, intensity and number of sessions
per day were at the discretion of the physical therapist. Trial interventions were provided
by 10 physical therapists with at least 2 years of clinical experience who received training
in motor control exercises and graded activity. Therefore, all therapists provided both
interventions. The training included a 2-day workshop for the motor control exercises
and a series of evening interactive seminars for graded activity, both administered by
recognised experts in the field. The same experts performed audits of trial treatment of
most of the treating physical therapists to evaluate and encourage compliance with the
treatment protocols. Although they did not have the specific data necessary to evaluate
the physical therapists’ compliance with the treatment protocols, their audits revealed
that most physical therapists followed the treatment protocols and there was no evidence
of cross-contamination. The physical therapists worked at private clinical practices or at
the university clinic
Motor control: 14 sessions, 1 hour, 8 weeks (4 weeks - 2 times per week/4 weeks - once
a week). A primary goal of the exercise was to enable the patient to regain control and
co-ordination of the spine and pelvis using principles of motor learning such as segmen-
tation and simplification. The intervention was based on assessment of the individual
participant’s motor control impairments and treatment goals (set collaboratively with
the therapist). The first stage of the treatment involved assessment of the postures, move-
ment patterns and muscle activation associated with symptoms and implementation of a
retraining programme designed to improve activity of muscles assessed to have poor con-
trol (commonly, but not limited to, the deeper muscles such as transversus abdominis,
multifidus, pelvic floor and diaphragm) and reducing activity of any muscle identified to
be overactive, commonly the large, more superficial trunk muscles such as the obliquus
externus abdominis. Participants were taught how to contract trunk muscles in a specific
manner and progress until they were able to maintain isolated contractions of the target
muscles for 10 repetitions of 10 seconds each while maintaining normal respiration.
Feedback such as palpation and real-time ultrasound images were available to enhance
learning of the tasks. During this stage, additional exercises for breathing control, posture
of the spine, and lower limb and trunk movement were performed. The 2nd stage of
the treatment involved the progression of the exercises toward more functional activities,
first using static and then dynamic tasks. Throughout this process, the recruitment of the
trunk muscles, posture, movement pattern and breathing were assessed and corrected. In
contrast to the graded activity programme, motor control exercise was guided by pain,
and exercises were mostly pain-free
Graded activity: 14 sessions, 1 hour, 8 weeks (4 weeks - 2 times per week/4 weeks
- once a week). A primary goal of the programme was to increase activity tolerance
by performing individualised and submaximal exercises, in addition to ignoring illness
behaviours and reinforcing wellness behaviours. The programme was based on activities
that each participant identified as problematic and that he or she could not perform
or had difficulty performing because of back pain. The activities in the programme
were progressed in a time-contingent manner (rather than a traditional pain-contingent
manner) from the baseline-assessed ability to a target goal set jointly by participant
and therapist. Participants received daily quotas and were instructed to only perform
the agreed amount, not less or more, even when they felt they were capable of doing
more. Cognitive-behavioural principles were used to help the participants overcome

the natural anxiety associated with pain and activities. The physical therapists used
positive reinforcement, explained pain mechanisms, and addressed negative behaviours
and pain-related anxiety. A plan for managing relapses was developed by the therapists
and participants

Methods
Randomised controlled trial
Participants
The sample population for this study was composed of individuals with chronic LBP
who were referred to an outpatient physical therapy clinic in western New York State.
All potential participants for this study were examined and referred to physical therapy
by a physician prior to consideration for participation
Inclusion criteria: participation in the study was based on the following criteria: partic-
ipants had to have been experiencing chronic LBP for greater than 7 weeks since the
initial onset, as defined by the Quebec Task Force, at the time of acceptance to the study
Exclusion criteria: patients were also excluded from the study if they were under 18,
pregnant, received Workman’s Compensation benefits, had litigation pending associated
with their present injury, had undergone more than one lumbar surgery, had been diag-
nosed with a psychological illness, were unable to understand English, or had been diag-
nosed with a systemic inflammatory disease (e.g. lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing
spondylitis, etc.)
Interventions
Participants in both groups received a physical therapy examination that assessed their
baseline strength, range of motion, response to repeated lumbar movements, passive
intervertebral motion, straight leg raising and neurological status. The examination was
conducted prior to instruction in the preceding interventions. Treatment schedules were
based on the physical therapist’s recommendation and the patient’s availability. Patients
in both groups were asked to perform approximately 10 to 15 minutes of home exercises
that were prescribed according to the treatment group to which they were assigned
Specificspine-stabilising exercise: 6weeks, once aweek. These exercisesfocusedonstrength-
ening the lumbar multifidus and transversus abdominis muscles through performance
of a lower abdominal contraction. In performing this exercise, the patient moved the
umbilicus towards the spine while the spine was maintained in a neutral alignment. To

an isolated co-contraction of these muscles, they were progressed to holding the contrac-

the classification, a treatment programme was prescribed that may have included posture
correction, performance of end-range repeated movements of the spine, or the use of
manual techniques designed to reduce and/or abolish the patient’s signs and symptoms

Participants
24participants(12lumbarstabilisationexercise group, 12lumbardynamicstrengthening
exercise group)
Inclusion criteria: patients complaining of non-specific LBP without any structural or
neuropsychological cause, for more than 3 months, were recruited from the rehabilitation
outpatient clinic
Exclusion criteria: history of neurological, infectious and systemic diseases, including
cerebrovascular disease, spinal cord disease, spondylitis, cancer, rheumatologic disorders
and other chronic diseases that cause long-term immobilisation. Patients who had un-
dergone prior surgery for back pain, patients who were prescribed exercise therapy in
the past, patients who seemed to have radicular pain due to nerve root involvement
on physical examination and patients with structural lesions, such as spondylolisthesis,
vertebral bone fracture, scoliosis and kyphosis on X-ray, were also excluded
Interventions
Each exercise session lasted 60 minutes and was performed 2 days per week, for 8 weeks.
All patients in both groups performed warm-up stretching exercises for 15 minutes before
the main exercises and cool down exercises for 10 minutes after each session. All exercises
were performed in the treatment room under the supervision of a physical therapist with
technical knowledge. The therapist put each patient into the appropriate position to
achieve the correct posture and muscle contraction. For all exercises in both groups, the
final static position was held for 10 seconds, and each exercise was performed for 10
repetitions. There was a pause of 3 seconds between repetitions and a 60-second rest
between each exercise. Exercise intensity (holding time and number of repetitions) was
increased gradually, based on the tolerance of each patient
Lumbar stabilisation exercise group: 1 hour, 2 days per week, 8 weeks. Lumbar stabili-
sation exercises consisted of 16 exercises, which aimed to strengthen the deep lumbar
stabilising muscles: the transversus abdominis, lumbar multifidi and internal obliques.
All 16 stabilisation exercises were performed once, consecutively, and in the same order.
Before each exercise, the physical therapist gave detailed verbal explanation and visual in-
structions (pictures), regarding the start and end positions. All exercises were conducted
according to the following specific principles: breathe in and out, gently and slowly draw
in your lower abdomen below your umbilicus without moving your upper stomach,
back or pelvis”; resulting in a situation referred to as hollowing. Participants practised
“hollowing” with a therapist providing verbal instruction and tactile feedback until they
were able to perform the manoeuvre in a satisfactory manner. In addition, a “bulging”
of the multifidus muscle should have been felt by the therapist when the fingers were
placed on either side of the spinous processes of the L4 and L5 vertebrae, directly over
the belly of this muscle. These feedback techniques provided by precise palpation of the

Methods
Randomised controlled trial
Participants
42 participants (21 core stabilisation exercise, 21 conventional group)
Patients aged 20 to 60 years who had had LBP for 3 months or longer were recruited
from the Orthopaedic Outpatient Department, the Physical Medicine and Rehabili-
tation Outpatient Department, and the Physical Therapy Department of Srinagarind
Hospital, Khon Kaen Province, Thailand. They underwent a history-taking interview
and a physical examination by an orthopaedic surgeon who was unaware of the treat-
ment procedure. Anteroposterior, lateral and flexion-extension radiographs were used
to exclude other spinal conditions. An instability catch sign was performed to confirm
the diagnosis of clinical lumbar stability. A positive instability catch sign was defined
as a sudden painful snap when a patient extends his/her back from the trunk forward-
bending position into the upright position. To be eligible, patients must have a pain
intensity of at least 5 out of 10, based on a numeric rating scale during instability catch
sign, and have a positive sign in one of the following provocation tests: painful catch,
apprehension sign, or prone instability test
Interventions
Eligible participants were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to one of the
2 groups: CSE and conventional group (CG). Lasting approximately 20 minutes, all
training sessions of both groups took place at the Physical Therapy Laboratory twice a
week for 10 weeks. Exercises were demonstrated and supervised by a research assistant
blinded to the outcome assessment
Core stabilisation exercise: 20 minutes, 2 times per week, 10 weeks. The 10-week exercise
programme was divided into 3 phases. The first phase, weeks 1 and 2, focused on correctly
isolating low-load activation of the transversus abdominis (TrA) and lumbar multifidus
(LM) muscles. Then, co-activation of TrA and LM were taught. A pressure biofeedback
device (Chattanooga Australia Pty Ltd, Brisbane, QLD, Australia) and electromyography
biofeedback (MP100, BIOPAC Systems Inc., Goleta, CA, USA) were used to provide
feedback and facilitate correct performance during training. The 2nd phase, weeks 3 to
7, started as soon as individuals could accurately control the TrA and LM muscles. The
exercises progressed to the application of low load to the muscles through controlled
movements of the upper and lower extremities. The last phase, weeks 8 to 10, aimed
to integrate this co-activation into functional tasks. The participants were trained to
maintain co-activation of TrA and LM during walking and 2 chosen tasks previously
known to aggravate pain
Conventional group: 20 minutes, 2 times per week, 10 weeks. This group performed active
trunk stretching exercises, which are the standard treatment for LBP in Thailand. The
exercisesconsistedof 10repetitionsof analternatingsingle knee tochest;aswell asalateral
trunk-bending in standing. Each exercise was to be held for 10 seconds. Immediately
after the exercises, a Hydrocollator (60°C) (Enraf-Nonius Medical Equipment Company
Ltd., Bangkok, Thailand), was placed over the lumbar area in the supine position for 15
minutes. Both groups were required to practise the demonstrated exercises at home on a
daily basis. To monitor their compliance, they were asked to record this in their logbook.

Methods
Randomised controlled trial
Participants
105 participants (48 lumbar stabilisation exercise, 57 manual therapy)
105 patients diagnosed with LBP and referred to physical therapy at 1 of 5 outpatient
clinics of Clalit Health Services in the Tel-Aviv metropolitan area, Israel, were recruited
for this study. Participants were included if they were 18 to 60 years of age, had a primary
complaint of LBP with or without associated leg symptoms (pain, paraesthesia), and had
a minimum score of 24% on the Hebrew version of the modified Oswestry Disability
Index (ODI) outcome measure
Interventions
16 physical therapists were involved in the study. 11 therapists, with between 4 and 12
years of experience in outpatient physical therapy patient care, provided treatment, and
5 therapists, with between 13 to 25 years of experience, performed baseline and follow-
up evaluations. Prior to beginning the study, all participating therapists underwent 2 x
4-hour sessions in which the rationale and protocol of the study were presented and the
examination and treatment procedures were demonstrated and practised. Therapists had
to pass a written examination of the study procedures prior to data collection. Finally,
each therapist received a manual describing treatment and evaluation procedures, based
on the therapist’s role in the study (treatment or evaluation). Therapists involved in
treating patients were unaware of the concept of the clinical prediction rule throughout
the study, to avoid bias from this knowledge during treatment. All treating therapists
provided both treatments of the study (lumbar stabilisation exercise and manual therapy)
. Patients in both groups received 11 treatment sessions over an 8-week period. Each
patient was seen twice a week during the first 4 weeks, then once a week for 3 additional
weeks. A 12th session (usually on the 8th week) consisted of a final evaluation. The total
number of sessions (12) matched the maximum number of physical therapy visits allowed
annually per condition under the policy of the Clalit Health Services health maintenance
organisation, which covered all patients participating in the study. Patients in both
groups were prescribed a home exercise programme consistent with their treatment
group; however, no attempt was made to monitor patients’ compliance with the home
exercise programme
Lumbar stabilisation exercise (LSE): 11 sessions (plus 1 final evaluation), 8 weeks (first
4 weeks: 2 times per week/last 3 weeks: 1 time per week). Patients were initially edu-
cated about the structure and function of the trunk musculature, as well as common
impairments in these muscles among patients with LBP
. Patients were then taught to
perform an isolated contraction of the transversus abdominis and lumbar multifidus
through an abdominal drawing-in manoeuvre (ADIM) in the quadruped, standing and
supine positions. Once a proper ADIM was achieved (most likely by the 2nd or 3rd
visit), additional loads were placed on the spine through various upper extremity, lower
extremity and trunk movement patterns. Exercises were performed in the quadruped,
side-lying, supine and standing positions, with the goal of recruiting a variety of trunk

muscles. In each position, exercises were ordered by their level of difficulty, and patients
progressed from one exercise to the next after satisfying specific predetermined criteria.
In the 7th treatment session, functional movement patterns were incorporated into the
training programme while performing an ADIM and maintaining a neutral lumbar spine
Manual therapy (MT): 11 sessions, 8 weeks (first 4 weeks: 2 times per week/last 3 weeks:
1 time per week). The MT intervention included several thrust and nonthrust manipu-
lative techniques directed at the lumbar spine that have been used previously with some
degree of success in various groups with LBP
. In addition, manual stretching of several
hip and thigh muscles was performed, as flexibility of the lower extremity is purported
to protect the spine from excessive strain. Finally, active range of motion and stretching
exercises were added to the programme, as these are commonly prescribed in combi-
nation with MT to maintain or improve the mobility gains resulting from the manual
procedures. The exercises included were selected to minimise trunk muscle activation
and to avoid duplication between the 2 interventions. All manual procedures and exer-
cises were prescribed based on the clinical judgement of the treating therapist; however,
each session could include up to 3 manual techniques, 1 of which had to be a thrust
manipulative technique directed at the lumbar spine, and an additional technique that
had to include a manual stretch of a lower extremity muscle. The 3rd technique, as well
as the complementary range of motion/flexibility exercises, was given at the discretion
of the treating therapist

Methods
Randomised controlled trial
Participants
47 participants included. Patients with low back pain (subacute, chronic or recurrent)
seeking care at a physiotherapy clinic in Stockholm in 1999-2000 were asked to par-
ticipate in the study. 47 patients (12 men, 35 women) volunteered to take part. They
received verbal and written information about the trial.
Inclusion criteria: men and women aged 18 to 60 years with LBP (pain > 6 weeks) with
or without radiation to the knee and pain provoked by provocation tests of lower lumbar
segments
Interventions
Stabilising training (ST): 6 weeks, once a week, 45 minutes. The ST-group patients (n
= 22) underwent a 6-week treatment programme, meeting individually with a physio-
therapist once a week for 45 minutes. The patients were told how to activate and control
their deep abdominal and lumbar multifidus muscles. The first phase was cognitive and
the patients were taught how these muscles act as stabilisers for the lumbar spine. The
importance of re-learning motor control of these muscles was underlined. The patients
were taught how to activate the deep abdominal muscles together with relaxed breathing
in different positions (e.g. supine crooked-lying, 4-point kneeling, prone, sitting and
standing). The activation of lumbar multifidus together with the deep abdominal mus-
cles was also trained.The physiotherapist monitored the patient by palpating the lower
abdominal quadrant for deep tensioning of the abdominal muscles and by palpating
the lumbar multifidus at the painful level. A bio-pressure unit (Chattanooga Pacific P/
L, Australia) was used in the learning process. The exercises were gradually developed
by applying low load to the muscles through the limbs in different positions. The pa-

tients were instructed in how to use contraction of the muscles during activities of daily
living and in situations that set off pain. They were encouraged to perform a training
programme, designed to take 10 to 15 minutes, at home each day. They kept a training
diary to control compliance. During each session the physiotherapist monitored how
well the patient was able to control the muscle activity and to perform the exercises. The
patients were also taught basic ergonomics
Manual therapy (MT): 6 weeks, once a week, 45 minutes. The MT-group patients (n
= 20) underwent a 6-week programme, being treated individually once a week by a
physiotherapist for 45 minutes. Manual techniques were used, based on findings from the
physical examination. They could include a combination of muscle stretching, segmental
traction and soft tissue mobilisation and, if needed, mobilisation of stiff thoracic and
upper lumbar segments. No manipulation was done. The patients were encouraged to
go on with their usual activities or exercises (not controlled). None of these exercises
included specific stabilising exercises. The patients were also taught basic ergonomics

Methods
Randomised controlled trial
Participants
71 patients included (36 men, 35 women)
Participants with LBP seeking care at a primary health care setting, a private physiother-
apy clinic, between August 2003 and May 2004 were considered for inclusion. Of the
participants, 23% were referred from general practitioners, and the rest sought care by
own initiative or by recommendations
Inclusion criteria: men and women aged 18 to 60 years, still at work despite ongoing
recurrent LBP (8 weeks) but with at least 1 pain-free period during the previous year.
LBP was defined as pain, ache or discomfort, localised below the costal margin and above
the inferior gluteal folds without referred leg pain. The participants had mechanically
induced LBP with pain on active movement (e.g. extension, flexion and lateral flexion),
paravertebral tenderness and a positive springing test of at least 1 lumbar segment. The
clinical tests used have previously been tested for good inter-examiner reliability
Interventions
The initial clinical examination lasted for 60 minutes for all included participants. All
participants were informed on inclusion that physical activity is beneficial for LBP
, but
not what activity is best. All participants received information on the importance of
continuing normal activities and basic advice on e.g. lifting, resting and sitting. The
treatment period was 8 weeks; the participants in the exercise group were individually
supervised by a PT weekly for 45 minutes and the participants in the reference group
met the PT for 45 minutes the first (week 1) and last week (week 8)
Exercise group: 8 weeks, once a week, 45 minutes. The PT individually supervised and
used clinical judgement in the progression of the graded stabilising exercises. First, the
participants were informed of how the stabilising muscles act, as hypothesised, in healthy
people and in those with LBP
. The PT demonstrated how the muscles act as stabilisers.
It was explained that the “deep inner muscle corset” (i.e. the local muscle system) and
the “outer corset” (i.e. the global muscle system) are both important for maintaining
good functional stability of the spine. The importance of relearning activation of the
84

(Continued)
deep inner corset (i.e. transversus abdominis and the deep multifidus) was emphasised.
To avoid recurrent LBP periods, the importance of contracting the stabilising muscles in
activities of daily life, especially those that set off pain, was underlined. The progression
of the exercises was based on the patients’ pain level and observed movement control
and quality. In contrast to strength training, the programme used low-load endurance
exercises. The first stage consisted of specific exercises to address the stabilising muscles,
after the protocol described by Richardson et al, with instructions to gently draw in
the anterolateral abdominal wall (i.e. transversus abdominis isolated from the other
abdominal muscles) together with a tightening of the MF in different non-postural
positions, together with relaxed breathing. A bio-pressure unit was used in the learning
process (Stabiliser; Chattanooga Group, Hixon, TM). In the subsequent phase, the
programme gradually progressed to performing the exercises posturally more upright
and to functionally loaded positions/exercises. Exercises with moderate resistance via
pulleys in standing and seated positions were performed to increase the demand on the
stabilising muscle system and to train the “local” and “global” muscle system together.
A natural spine position both during the exercises and in daily life was emphasised,
avoiding pain-generating postures. The patients were encouraged to perform the low-
load exercises at home every day. The home-training programme was designed to take
approximately 15 minutes, and has previously been reported on. The participants were
instructed to maintain the programme indefinitely to avoid recurrence of pain. It was
emphasised that although adherence with a home-training programme is important, the
most important thing is to incorporate activation of the stabilising muscles in daily life
Reference group: 8 weeks, once a week, 45 minutes. The participants in the reference
group (n = 35) were informed of the benefits of daily walks as physical activity. They
were instructed to take a 30-minute walk every day. The walk might be divided into 2
parts of 15 minutes. They were instructed to walk at the fastest pace that was convenient
and did not set off pain. If their pain persisted or increased they should slow down.
They should continue with other usual activities. They were also given general home
exercises but with no follow-up instructions. The daily walks taken were recorded in a
diary, which was returned to the PT at the last visit. The participants were informed that
if the pain increased or if they had any questions they were free to call their PT

Participants
21 patients included
Inclusion criteria: participants were recruited from the greater city Seoul, Korea. Partic-
ipants who expressed interest in the study became eligible for the study. Those partici-
pants who met study inclusion criteria received information regarding the purpose and
methods of the study and signed a copy of the Institutional Review Board approved
consent form. In this study, patients with recurrent LBP were defined as those who met
study inclusion criteria and experienced a disturbing impairment or abnormality in the

functioning of the low back. The patients with recurrent LBP were defined as those who
previously experienced at least 1 episode of work-related back pain. Current diagnoses
and prior injury data were based on both a physician’s history and physical exam results,
which were obtained from the patients’ records. Participants were eligible to participate
if they: 1) were 21 years of age or older, 2) had at least 1 episode of work-related back
pain without referred pain into the lower extremities, and 3) indicated a willingness to
participate in a daily exercise programme and in supervised exercise sessions 5 times a
week for 4 weeks during the intervention period
Exclusion criteria: participants were excluded from participation if they: 1) had a diag-
nosed mental illness that might interfere with the study protocol, 2) had difficulty in
understanding written/spoken English that precluded them from completing question-
naires, 3) had overt neurological signs (sensory deficits or motor paralysis), or 4) were
pregnant
Interventions
Spinal stabilisation exercise (SSE): 3 times per week, 4 weeks (5 times per week - home ex-
ercise). The SSE protocol was designed to improve spinal stabilisation through core mus-
cle strengthening rather than to improve spinal stabilisation through low back muscles
endurance or strengthening. The SSE group performed specific localised exercises aimed
at restoring the stabilising protective function of the spinal muscles around the spinal
joint. As applied by several authors, the exercises were designed specifically to activate
and train the isometric holding function of the spinal muscle at the affected vertebral
segment (in co-contraction with the transversus abdominis muscle); this rehabilitation
approach is described in detail. Patients from the SSE group were seen 3 times per week,
but performed the exercises 5 times per week at home. In addition to performing home
exercises, the patients performed the 20-minute exercise session in the lab (supervised
by the research co-ordinator) 3 times per week for 4 weeks to ensure that the exercises
were being performed correctly. Patients kept an exercise log, and phone calls were made
to ensure compliance with the exercise protocol
Control group (advice only): the control group received a hard copy of medical manage-
ment techniques, which included advice regarding bed rest, absence from work, pre-
scription medications and resuming normal activity as tolerated

Methods
Randomised controlled trial
Participants
41 participants. Patients presenting to the orthopaedic clinics of Merlin Park Hospital,
Galway, Ireland, who were given a referral for physiotherapy and met the inclusion
criteria were included in the trial
Inclusion criteria: the study required that the participants were aged 20 to 60 years,
complained of LBP for a minimum of 12 weeks and possessed the ability to give informed
consent, understand instructions and co-operate with treatment
Exclusion criteria: participants were excluded if their LBP was as a result of systemic or
structural pathology, were diagnosed with inflammatory joint disease or displayed overt
neurological signs
Interventions
Treatment group: 10 exercise training sessions, 10 weeks (week 1: 2 times, 1 hour/week
2: 2 times, 30 minutes weeks 3 to 10: 1 time, 30 minutes). Participants in the treatment
group underwent a standardised treatment schedule of 10 exercise-training sessions over
10 weeks. This consisted of 2 x 1-hour sessions during week 1, 2 x 30-minute sessions

during week 2, 1 x 30-minute session during each of weeks 3 to 6, and 1 x 30-minute
session during week 8 and 10. Treatment was delivered by a chartered physiotherapist
and involved exercise therapy sessions aimed at training core stability muscles. The train-
ing programme was carried out in the following manner: (1) Participants were trained
how to activate their transversus abdominus and multifidus muscles. Facilitation strate-
gies utilised by the physiotherapist included visualisation techniques, verbal instruction,
manual palpation and education using illustrations. Strength of contraction, monitored
using a pressure biofeedback unit, was restricted to low levels compared to maximum
voluntary contraction. (2) Training commenced in a low-load non-functional position
(prone lying, 4-point kneeling, supine lying with flexed knees). Substitution strategies
such as raising the rib cage, external oblique over activity or breath holding were avoided.
(3) Holding time for exercises was gradually increased to the point where participants
were able to perform 10 contractions with 10-second holds. (4) Once participants were
able to perform sustained contractions in low-load postures, the regime was progressed
by adding leverage through limb movement. (5) Participants performed a daily mainte-
nance exercise programme at home in between exercise sessions with the physiotherapist.
Participants’ performance of this programme was facilitated by means of written material
(created using PhysioTools software)
Control group: control participants received no intervention. Following a period of 10
weeks, participants completed follow-up testing on all questionnaires. Control partic-
ipants received standard physiotherapy intervention once their follow-up testing was
completed

Stankovic 2012
Methods
Randomised controlled trial
Participants
160 patients (100 specific lumbar stabilisation, 60 control)
Inclusion criteria: low back pain that lasted more than 12 weeks, varying in intensity
and irradiation, from mild to very strong, Functional limitations in performing certain
activities of everyday living: dressing, lifting heavy objects, walking, running, sitting,
standing, sleeping, etc
Exclusion criteria: proven acute radiculopathy or severe pain below the knee (clinical
examination and interview), inability to perform isometric muscle contractions or to be
exposed to medium level of physical exertion due to some internal illness (cardiovascular,
pulmonary, systemic etc.), some neurological illness (stroke, polyneuropathy), lack of
understanding of the study (dementia, language problems), drug or alcohol abuse
Interventions
All participants had a total of 20 therapeutic treatments, for 4 weeks (5 days per week).
Each treatment lasted 30 minutes. All data were collected before and after the therapy
Specific lumbar stabilisation: 20 sessions, 4 weeks, 5 days/week, 30 minutes. The Study
Group (SG) had a combined exercise programme that included spinal segmental stabili-
sation exercises. The programme consisted of 15 exercises, designed to combine isometric
contraction of stabilising muscles of the lower back, abdominal wall and the pelvic floor,
with aerobic set of exercises for CLBP
. Each session began in a standing position. After
several relaxation and breathing exercises, the patients were given instructions about how
to form a stabilising corset by joint isometric contraction of the multifidus and transver-
sus abdominis muscles. The verification of the achieved stabilisation was carried out by
the therapist and the patients themselves, palpating the contracted muscles. The partici-
pants learned how to maintain and properly quantify achieved contractions while doing
simple exercises. After the initial stabilisation training, the patients were ready to begin
with strengthening and stretching aerobic exercises. The programme was performed in
standing, sitting, kneeling and lying positions. During the exercises, the patients were
trying to keep their trunk and pelvic girdle inactive. The programme consisted of differ-

ent sets of exercises such as: pelvic elevation (bridging), abdominal training (curl-ups),
mixed extension/flexion stretch of the spinal column (cat-camel), hook-lying (posterior
pelvic inclination), etc. They also included exercises on unstable support (Swiss Ball), in
order to improve proprioception, co-ordination and balance
Control (exercise): 20 sessions, 4 weeks, 5 days/week, 30 minutes. Control group (CG)
consisted of treatment carried out according to traditional Regan-Michelle’s protocol,
strengthening and stretching aerobic exercises, without pelvic immobilisation and core
stabilisation. The programme was designed to activate the large muscle groups in the
superficial layer of the lower back and abdomen in order to improve overall muscle
strength and endurance

Tsauo 2009
Methods
Randomised controlled trial
Participants
37 participants - functional training group (20), control group (17)
Inclusion criteria: patients with non-specific LBP for at least 3 months, with activity
limitation in work or home maintenance, were recruited for this study
Exclusion criteria: they were screened by a physiatrist to rule out LBP with specific origins,
such as sciatica from a herniated disc or radiculopathy
Interventions
Patients in both groups might maintain their current rehabilitation programme, and
patients in the training group underwent an additional training programme. The current
treatments for participants in both groups were almost the same because they were
recruited from the same department
Functional training group: maximum of 3 hours per day, 2 to 3 months of training. The
strengthening programme was focused on trunk stabilisation training for the superficial
and deep trunk muscles and the extremities. Trunk stabilisation training was executed
with a stabiliser (Chattanooga Group, USA) for biofeedback initially. After patients could
control their trunk muscles (transversus abdominis and multifidus) effectively in both
static and dynamic conditions, movements of the extremities with graded increments
of range and weight were added. Core muscle contraction was further incorporated
into the training activities to simulate patients’ life needs. Programmes of work/activity
simulation training, such as push, pull and lift with or without weights, were determined
according to the testing results of the FCE and the patient’s activity requirement. Patients
could terminate the programme if they felt uncomfortable during training. The training
intensity and time increased to a maximum of 3 hours per day as the patients’ endurance
improved. In all, patients would spend 100 hours over a period of 2 to 3 months in
training
Control group: no treatment

Participants
Participants included were 19 to 60 years of age with chronic non-specific LBP of at least
3 months’ duration and with pain at presentation between 2 and 10 on the numeric pain
rating scale (NPRS) (0 to 10). Participants were recruited from general practitioners or
physical therapists (29/109) and by announcement to employees at a large local hospital
(80/109) in Norway
Exclusion criteria: participants were excluded for the following reasons: previous back
surgery, radiating pain below the knee or neurologic signs from nerve root compression,
systemic or widespread pain, overweight preventing ultrasound imaging, pregnancy, di-

agnosed psychiatric disease, sick leave for more than 1 year, recipient of disability bene-
fits, unresolved social security or insurance problems or insufficient language capabilities
Interventions
The participants in all treatment groups attended treatment once a week for 8 weeks.
The attendance at weekly treatment sessions was recorded, but adherence to home ex-
ercise was not recorded. All participants were encouraged to stay active in their daily
life, as recommended by systematic reviews on advice for management of LBP
. In addi-
tion, all participants received a booklet with general information on LBP provided by
the Norwegian Network of Back Pain that also emphasised benefits of varied physical
activity for non-specific LBP
. Participants were not allowed to receive other treatment
for LBP during the intervention period. The physical therapists were experienced in the
exercise methods applied. Participants in all treatment groups received home exercises
for flexibility when considered necessary
Motor control: once a week, 8 weeks, 40 minutes. The motor control treatments lasted
40 minutes and took place in an outpatient clinic. The low-load motor control exercises
were individualised and taught by a specially trained physical therapist according to a
protocol on therapeutic exercise for lumbopelvic stabilisation and ultrasound imaging.
Ultrasound imaging was used as both a teaching tool and an evaluation tool (separate
substudy). Patients with motor control deficits may benefit from visual feedback of mus-
cle function from ultrasound imaging. Ultrasound imaging is increasingly used among
clinicians to retrain motor control in the deep abdominal muscles. The low-load motor
control exercises focused on isolated control and activity of the transversus abdominus
during the abdominal drawing-in manoeuvre (ADIM). The aim of the ADIM was to
voluntary activate transversus abdominis (TrA) thickening and lateral slide while the in-
ternal oblique and external oblique abdominal muscles remained relatively unchanged.
The exercises were executed with low effort and with relaxed respiration and were con-
tinuously monitored by direct observation of respiration and by real-time b-mode ultra-
sound imaging of superficial and deep muscle activity. Activity in the abdominal muscles
was visualised on the ultrasound screen for each participant and used for feedback in
all treatment sessions. Participants also were instructed in pelvic floor and multifidus
muscle contractions. Furthermore, a goal was to obtain controlled co-contraction of
the TrA, the deep fibres of the multifidus muscle, and the pelvic floor muscles while
keeping other muscles relaxed. Participants who achieved isolated activity of the TrA in
the supine position progressed to activation of the TrA similarly in sitting and standing
positions. Toward the end of the intervention period, the participants were instructed
to incorporate the ADIM into activities of daily living. Written instruction to carry out
the ADIM at home was provided, and participants were encouraged to perform 10 pain-
free contractions 2 to 3 times per day, holding each contraction for 10 seconds
Sling exercise: once a week, 8 weeks. The participants in the sling exercise intervention
group were instructed individually by a specially trained physical therapist. The exercises
were chosen from a predefined set of back exercises in slings on the basis of an assessment
of each participant’s ability to keep the lumbar spine stable in the neutral position
through a range of leg and arm positions and movements. The sling method for dosing
lumbopelvic exercises has been assessed in combination with other treatment modalities
in earlier studies. Unloading elastic bands were attached to the pelvis to help participants
maintain the neutral spine position at all times and for exercises to progress without
pain. Exercise progression was achieved by gradually reducing the elastic band support.
The supported position where the participants could no longer maintain the neutral

spine position was used as the baseline for further exercise progression. By placing the
participants in demanding but pain-free positions and asking them to hold the spine in
neutral, the aim was to activate the deep and superficial stabilising trunk muscles (local
and global muscles). When weakness, pain, fatigue or asymmetry was identified, this
position served as starting point for training and further progression. The number of
repetitions and sets was individually adjusted according to pain and fatigue. The sling
exercises were performed for 40 minutes once a week in a physical therapy clinic
General exercise: once a week, 8 weeks. The general exercise intervention received general
trunk strengthening and stretching exercises, as recommended in the management of
non-specific LBP
. Exercises were instructed by a physical therapist and performed in
small groups of 2 to 8 people. Exercises performed were, for instance, trunk extension,
flexion and rotation with resistance and stretching of trunk and extremity muscles. The
exercises were performed for 1 hour weekly in a local fitness centre with a traditional
resistance apparatus and with 10 repetitions in 3 sets. The exercise instructor supervised
each participant and individually directed and adapted the exercise performance when
needed

Effects of specific physiotherapy treatment and advice versus advice alone on pain and function for people
with subacute reducible discogenic low back pain: a randomised controlled trial
Methods
RCT
Participants
Patients with reducible discogenic low back pain
Interventions
Intervention group: 10 sessions of specific physiotherapy management over 10 weeks, involving 30-minute
sessions. Frequency of sessions will be individually tailored based on the individual’s progress. Generally,
participants will initially attend 2 sessions per week for the first fortnight and then will attend the final
6 sessions spread out over the final 8 weeks. Management will include specific lumbar spine directional
preference exercises, taping of the lumbar spine, a gradually progressed core stability exercise programme and
condition specific advice and education
Control group: 2 sessions of physiotherapy advice over a 10-week period (involving one 30-minute session
directly following randomisation and another 30-minute session 5 weeks following randomisation). The
sessions will involve condition-specific advice regarding the prognosis and self management of the condition
Outcomes
Primary outcomes: back-specific function (Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire), back pain
intensity on a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale, leg pain intensity on a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale

Trial name or title
A comparison of mechanical diagnosis & therapy and motor control exercises on the thickness of the trunk
muscle in patients with chronic low back pain
Methods
RCT
Participants
Patients with chronic low back pain
Interventions
Arm 1: mechanical diagnosis and therapy, more commonly known as the McKenzie method. This is a system of
exercises and manual therapy that uses repeated end range lumbar spine movements that promote a reduction
in pain from its most distal point on the limb towards the centre of the back. The exercises are done in a
specific direction (for example, lumbar extension), which has been determined by a trained therapist during
the patient assessment. Following the consultation the patient is asked to perform these exercises at home and
implement postural correction 5 to 6 times per day for a few minutes each time. The patient is required to
attend for regular reviews as clinically warranted. The patient may attend for a maximum of 12 treatments
over an 8-week period. Each session may last up to 30 minutes
Arm 2: motor control exercises. These are exercises that are specifically designed to improve the co-ordination
of the trunk muscles. They are given under the guidance of a physiotherapist who has been trained in their
implementation. They are initially done in the lying position and as able are progressed to be done as sitting,
standing and functional activities. Patients will receive what is clinically required as decided by the therapist.
Patients may receive up to 12 sessions over an 8-week period. Each session may last up to 30 minutes. Patients
will be given a home exercise programme to practise at home for 30 minutes each day

Efficacy of graded activity versus supervised exercises in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain:
protocol of a randomised controlled trial
Methods
RCT
Participants
Patients with non-specific CLBP
Interventions
Patients in the supervised exercise group will perform stretching, strengthening and motor control exercises
For the graded activity group, we will follow the protocols described by Macedo et al and Smeets et al, which
are based on individualised, progressive and sub-maximal exercises aiming to improve physical fitness and
stimulate changes in behaviour and attitudes due to pain. Positive reinforcement will be provided during
the sessions (“you are doing great”, “congratulations”, “keep up with the good work”, “you can make it”)
, with the aim of maintaining the motivation. In the beginning of the treatment, patients will select 1 or
2 activities considered difficult to them and receive guidance concerning them throughout the treatment,
with the establishment of weekly goals. Participants will also receive an educational material (based on “Back
Book”), with the purpose of providing important information about how to care for the spine. Weekly reading

Appendix 2. Criteria for assessing risk of bias for internal validity
Random sequence generation (selection bias)
Selection bias (biased allocation to interventions) due to inadequate generation of a randomised sequence
There is a low risk of selection bias if the investigators describe a random component in the sequence generation process such as: referring
to a random number table, using a computer random number generator, coin tossing, shuffling cards or envelopes, throwing dice,
drawing of lots, minimisation (minimisation may be implemented without a random element, and this is considered to be equivalent
to being random).
There is a high risk of selection bias if the investigators describe a non-random component in the sequence generation process, such
as: sequence generated by odd or even date of birth, date (or day) of admission, hospital or clinic record number; or allocation by
judgement of the clinician, preference of the participant, results of a laboratory test or a series of tests, or availability of the intervention.
Allocation concealment (selection bias)
Selection bias (biased allocation to interventions) due to inadequate concealment of allocations prior to assignment
There is a low risk of selection bias if the participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because
one of the following, or an equivalent method, was used to conceal allocation: central allocation (including telephone, web-based
and pharmacy-controlled randomisation); sequentially numbered drug containers of identical appearance; or sequentially numbered,
opaque, sealed envelopes.
There is a high risk of bias if participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce
selection bias, such as allocation based on: using an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers); assignment
envelopes were used without appropriate safeguards (e.g. if envelopes were unsealed or non-opaque or not sequentially numbered);
alternation or rotation; date of birth; case record number; or other explicitly unconcealed procedures.

 Blinding of participants
Performance bias due to knowledge of the allocated interventions by participants during the study
There is a low risk of performance bias if blinding of participants was ensured and it was unlikely that the blinding could have been
broken; or if there was no blinding or incomplete blinding, but the review authors judge that the outcome is not likely to be influenced
by lack of blinding.
Blinding of personnel/care providers (performance bias)
Performance bias due to knowledge of the allocated interventions by personnel/care providers during the study
There is a low risk of performance bias if blinding of personnel was ensured and it was unlikely that the blinding could have been
broken; or if there was no blinding or incomplete blinding, but the review authors judge that the outcome is not likely to be influenced
by lack of blinding.
Blinding of outcome assessor (detection bias)
Detection bias due to knowledge of the allocated interventions by outcome assessors
There is low risk of detection bias if the blinding of the outcome assessment was ensured and it was unlikely that the blinding could
have been broken; or if there was no blinding or incomplete blinding, but the review authors judge that the outcome is not likely to
be influenced by lack of blinding, or:
• for patient-reported outcomes in which the patient was the outcome assessor (e.g. pain, disability): there is a low risk of bias for
outcome assessors if there is a low risk of bias for participant blinding (Boutron 2005);
• for outcome criteria that are clinical or therapeutic events that will be determined by the interaction between patients and care
providers (e.g. co-interventions, length of hospitalisation, treatment failure), in which the care provider is the outcome assessor: there
is a low risk of bias for outcome assessors if there is a low risk of bias for care providers (Boutron 2005);
• for outcome criteria that are assessed from data from medical forms: there is a low risk of bias if the treatment or adverse effects
of the treatment could not be noticed in the extracted data (Boutron 2005).
Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)
Attrition bias due to amount, nature or handling of incomplete outcome data
There is a low risk of attrition bias if there were no missing outcome data; reasons for missing outcome data were unlikely to be related
to the true outcome (for survival data, censoring unlikely to be introducing bias); missing outcome data were balanced in numbers,
with similar reasons for missing data across groups; for dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with
the observed event risk was not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on the intervention effect estimate; for continuous outcome
data, the plausible effect size (difference in means or standardised difference in means) among missing outcomes was not enough to have
a clinically relevant impact on observed effect size, or missing data were imputed using appropriate methods (if dropouts are very large,
imputation using even ’acceptable’ methods may still suggest a high risk of bias) (van Tulder 2003). The percentage of withdrawals and
dropouts should not exceed 20% for short-term follow-up and 30% for long-term follow-up and should not lead to substantial bias
(these percentages are commonly used but arbitrary, not supported by literature) (van Tulder 2003).

Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Selective reporting (reporting bias)
Reporting bias due to selective outcome reporting
There is low risk of reporting bias if the study protocol is available and all of the study’s pre-specified (primary and secondary) outcomes
that are of interest in the review have been reported in the pre-specified way, or if the study protocol is not available but it is clear that
the published reports include all expected outcomes, including those that were pre-specified (convincing text of this nature may be
uncommon).
There is a high risk of reporting bias if not all of the study’s pre-specified primary outcomes have been reported; one or more primary
outcomes is reported using measurements, analysis methods or subsets of the data (e.g. subscales) that were not pre-specified; one or
more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified (unless clear justification for their reporting is provided, such as an unexpected
adverse effect); one or more outcomes of interest in the review are reported incompletely so that they cannot be entered in a meta-
analysis; the study report fails to include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for such a study.
Group similarity at baseline (selection bias)
Bias due to dissimilarity at baseline for the most important prognostic indicators.
There is low risk of bias if groups are similar at baseline for demographic factors, value of main outcome measure(s) and important
prognostic factors (examples in the field of back and neck pain are duration and severity of complaints, vocational status, percentage
of patients with neurological symptoms) (van Tulder 2003).
Co-interventions (performance bias)
Bias because co-interventions were different across groups
There is low risk of bias if there were no co-interventions or they were similar between the index and control groups (van Tulder 2003).
Compliance (performance bias)
Bias due to inappropriate compliance with interventions across groups
There is low risk of bias if compliance with the interventions was acceptable, based on the reported intensity/dosage, duration, number
and frequency for both the index and control intervention(s). For single-session interventions (e.g. surgery), this item is irrelevant (van
Tulder 2003).
Intention-to-treat-analysis
There is low risk of bias if all randomised patients were reported/analysed in the group to which they were allocated by randomisation.
Timing of outcome assessments (detection bias)
Bias because important outcomes were not measured at the same time across groups
There is low risk of bias if all important outcome assessments for all intervention groups were measured at the same time (van Tulder
2003).
Other bias
Bias due to problems not covered elsewhere in the table
There is a low risk of bias if the study appears to be free of other sources of bias not addressed elsewhere (e.g. study funding).
