IMPORTANCE Large-scale generic studies offer detailed information on potential risk factors
for refractive error across the life course, but ophthalmic examination in such cases to
determine the refractive error phenotype is challenging and costly. Thus, refractive status is
commonly assigned using questionnaires. In a population survey, often only a few
condition-specific self-reported questions can be included, so the questions used must be
effective in ruling in those who have the trait of interest and ruling out those who do not.
OBJECTIVE To determine the accuracy of identification of refractive status using self-reported
age at and/or reason for first use of glasses or contact lenses (optical correction).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The UK Biobank study, a cross-sectional epidemiologic
study, included 117 278 participants aged 40 to 69 years in 6 regional centers in England and
Wales. Data for the present study were assessed from June 2009 to July 2010. Patients
underwent autorefraction measurement. Spherical equivalent in the more extreme eye was
used to categorize myopia (−1.00 diopter [D] or more extreme) and hypermetropia
(+1.00 D or more extreme).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Sensitivity and specificity of the reason for optical
correction were assessed using autorefraction as the gold standard. Receiver operating
characteristic curves assessed the accuracy of self-reported age at first use of optical
correction and incremental improvement with addition of the reason.
RESULTS Of the 95 240 participants who reported using optical correction (55.6% female;
mean [SD] age, 57.7 [7.5] years), 92 121 (96.7%) provided their age at first use and 93 156
(97.8%) provided the reason. For myopia, sensitivity of the reason for optical correction was
89.1% (95% CI, 88.7%-89.4%), specificity was 83.7% (95% CI, 83.4%-84.0%), and positive
and negative predictive values were 72.7% (95% CI, 72.2%-73.1%) and 94.0% (95% CI,
93.8%-94.2%), respectively. The area under the curve was 0.829 (95% CI, 0.826-0.831) and
improved to 0.928 (95% CI, 0.926-0.930) with combined information. By contrast,
self-report of the reason for optical correction of hypermetropia had low sensitivity (38.1%;
95% CI, 37.6%-38.6%), and the area under the curve with combined information was 0.713
(95% CI, 0.709-0.716).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In combination, self-report of the reason for and age at first
use of optical correction are accurate in identifying myopia. These findings indicate an agreed
set of questions could be implemented effectively in large-scale generic population-based
studies to increase opportunities for integrated research on refractive error leading to
development of novel prevention or treatment strategies.

efractiveerror,particularlymyopia,isanimportantpub-
lic health concern worldwide, because it is the most
common cause of impaired vision and because of the
associated risk for complications causing blindness.1 The costs
of correction (optical or surgical) are high.2 Striking temporal
changes in whole-population distribution of refraction have
resulted in increased frequency and severity of myopia in par-
ticular. Half of the adult population in the United States and
WesternEurope3-5nowhasrefractiveerror,andanevengreater
proportion of Asian populations has myopia.6
Thechallengeforpreventionanddiseasemodificationnow
lies in combining genetic, classic, and life-course epidemio-
logic research to elucidate how genetic and environmental risk
factors combine to influence risk and severity.7,8 Such re-
search requires very large general population-based surveys
and/or cohort studies with detailed information on potential
riskfactorsacrossthelifecourse,informationthatisoftenlack-
ing in disorder-specific ophthalmic studies. Undertaking a de-
tailed ophthalmic assessment in this context, usually using
nonspecialist examiners, to determine refractive status with
accuracyismethodologicallychallenging,timeconsuming,and
costly. An alternative approach has been to elicit refractive sta-
tus using questionnaires. Although limited research has in-
vestigated the validity of self-reported questionnaire data on
refraction, investigators recognize that accuracy depends on
the specific questions asked and whether responses are used
singly or in combination.9,10 We herein report on the utility of
self-report of the reason for and age at first use of glasses or
contact lenses (optical correction), separately or in combina-
tion, for categorization of myopia and hypermetropia in the
UKBiobankStudy,acontemporarypopulation-basedstudyun-

Methods
Study Population
The UK Biobank Study is a prospective investigation of health
and disease in more than 500 000 adults recruited from Feb-
ruary 2006 to July 2010 (http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/). From
June 2009, the protocol included an ophthalmic examination
consisting of noncycloplegic autorefraction (RC-5000 Auto
Refkeratometer; Tomey Corp) on a subsample of 117 278
participants (23.3% of the entire sample) aged 40 to 69 years
in 6 regional centers in England and Wales, as reported
elsewhere.11 The UK Biobank Study has been approved by the
North West Multicentre Research Ethics Committee, which
covers the United Kingdom. The study also obtained approval
in England and Wales from the Patient Information Advisory
Group, which has since been replaced by the National
Information Governance Board for Health and Social Care,
which allows access to information for inviting individuals to
participate. Participants recruited into the UK Biobank Study
provided written informed consent.
Classification of Refractive Errors
Spherical equivalent (SE) measurements (algebraic sum in di-
opters [D] of the sphere + 0.5 cylinder) were used to catego-
rize refractive error in each eye, with a threshold of −1.00 D or
more extreme for myopia. We defined the following catego-
ries: mild myopia (−1.00 to −2.99 D), moderate myopia (−3.00
to −5.99 D), high myopia (−6.00 D or worse), emmetropia
(−0.99 to 0.99 D), mild hypermetropia (+1.00 to +2.99 D), and
moderate to high hypermetropia (+3.00 D or more extreme).
Participants answered the following questions with the
given response options about optical correction:
1. Do you wear glasses or contact lenses to correct your vision?
(1) Yes; (2) no; or (3) prefer not to answer.
2. If yes, what age did you first start to wear glasses or contact
lenses?
(1) Age in years; (2) do not know; or (3) prefer not to answer.
3. If yes, why were you prescribed glasses or contact lenses?
(1) For short-sightedness (ie, only or mainly for distance view-
ing such as driving, cinema, etc) (called myopia); (2) for long-
sightedness (ie, for distance and near tasks like reading) (called
hypermetropia); (3) for just reading/near work as you are get-
ting older (called presbyopia); (4) for astigmatism; (5) for a
“squint” or “turn” in an eye since childhood (called strabis-
mus); (6) for a “lazy” eye or an eye with poor vision since child-
hood (called amblyopia); (7) other eye condition; (8) do not
know; or (9) prefer not to answer.

Key Points
Question Is self-reported age at, or the reason for, first ever use of
optical correction accurate in identifying refractive status?
Findings In this UK adult population, self-report of the reason for
and age at first use of optical correction were found to have good
accuracy for identification of myopia when compared with
spherical equivalent in the more extreme eye, and the accuracy
improved if the information was combined. However, the
prediction of hypermetropia was poor overall.
Meaning Questions relating to age at or reason for first use of
optical correction could be implemented effectively in large-scale
generic population-based studies on refractive error.

Results
Participation and Study Sample
Autorefraction data were available for 107 409 participants
(91.6% of those invited). Those participants who did not meet
the protocol requirements, including those who did not un-
dergotestingorhadnomeasurementavailableowingtoequip-
ment failure (n = 4079), who had prior eye treatment or a con-
dition that could affect current refraction (eg, cataract, cataract
surgery, or myopia secondary to other ocular condition
[n = 5058]), and who had highly discordant refraction mea-
sures for the 2 eyes (n = 732), were excluded as described
elsewhere.11 Four hundred twenty-six participants had no in-
formation on the use of optical correction (eFigure 1 in the
Supplement).
Of those 107 409 participants with refraction data, 54.4%
were female. The mean (SD) age of female participants was
56.4 (8.0) years; of male participants, 56.9 (8.2) years (over-
all, 56.6 [8.1] years). Thirty-two thousand one hundred sixty-
five individuals (29.9%) had myopia; 34 064 (31.7%), hyper-
metropia; and 41 180 (38.3%), emmetropia (eTable in the
Supplement).
Accuracy of Self-report of Reason for Optical Correction
Of 107 409 participants, 95 240 (88.7%) reported wearing
glasses or contact lenses (55.6% female; mean [SD] age, 57.7
[7.5] years). Of these, 93 156 (97.8%) reported the reason for
wearing glasses, including myopia in 37 368 (40.1%), hyper-
metropia in 19 646 (21.1%), or other reasons (eg, astigmatism
or presbyopia) in 36 142 (38.8%) (Table 1).
Myopia
The sensitivity for myopia was 89.1% (95% CI, 88.7%-89.4%),
whereas the specificity was 83.7% (95% CI, 83.4%-84.0%)
(Table 2). The positive and negative predictive values for
myopia were 72.7% (95% CI, 72.2%-73.1%) and 94.0% (95%
CI, 93.8%-94.2%), respectively. Of those participants who
self-reported having myopia, 6573 (17.6%) were actually
emmetropic, with a median SE of −0.50 (interquarile range
[IQR], −0.76 to 0.16) D, and 3645 (9.8%) were hypermetropic,
with a median SE of 2.13 (IQR, 1.53 to 3.09) D (Table 1). The
median age of those reporting myopia who in fact had emme-
tropia was 58 (IQR, 50-63) years, with a median age at first
use of optical correction of 30 (IQR, 18-45) years, and 1991

 (30.3%) reported wearing glasses for presbyopia as well as
myopia. Of those who reported myopia but actually had
hypermetropia, the median age was 63 (IQR, 59-66) years
with a median age at first use of optical correction of 40 (IQR,
18-48) years, and 1577 (43.3%) reported wearing glasses for
presbyopia as well.
Hypermetropia
In the group of 19 646 participants self-reporting hypermetro-
pia, the sensitivity of the question on reason for wearing op-
ticalcorrectionwas38.1%(95%CI,37.6%-38.6%),withahigher
specificity of 87.8% (95% CI, 87.6%-88.1%) (Table 2). Of those
participants who self-reported hypermetropia, 5803 (29.5%)
actuallyhademmetropia,withamedianSEof0.38(IQR,−0.28
to 0.70) D, and 1649 (8.4%) had myopia, with a median SE of
−2.44 (IQR, −4.49 to −1.42) D (Table 1). Thus, the positive pre-
dictive value was 62.1% (95% CI, 61.4%-62.7%), and the nega-
tivepredictivevaluewas73.1%(95%CI,72.7%-73.4%)(Table2).
The median age of those who reported having hypermetropia
and actually had emmetropia was 58 (IQR, 51-63) years, with
a median age at first use of optical correction of 42 (IQR,
25-48) years, and 940 (16.2%) reported wearing glasses for
presbyopia and hypermetropia. Those who self-reported hy-
permetropia and actually had myopia had a median age of 58
(IQR, 52-63) years and reported the median age at first use of
optical correction as 18 (IQR, 12-32) years. Of this group, 125
(7.6%) reported wearing glasses for presbyopia. Overall, 92 121
study participants (96.7%) reported the age at first use of op-
tical correction, with 90 307 (94.8%) reporting first age at and
reason for use of optical correction.
Myopia
The median age at first use of optical correction for those
with myopia was 15 (IQR, 11-22) years (Figure 1A). The
median SE in participants with myopia varied by age at first
use from −5.63 (IQR, −7.98 to −3.72) D in those younger than
10 years to −1.49 (−2.07 to −1.20) D in those 40 years or
older (Table 3). We found an association between the age at
first use of optical correction and severity of myopia; 95.1%
of those with high myopia, 80.9% of those with moderate
myopia, and 46.7% of those with mild myopia used optical
correction at younger than 20 years (Table 3). Most partici-
pants with first use of optical correction at 40 years or older
had mild myopia.
Hypermetropia
Although the overall median age reported at first use of opti-
cal correction for participants with hypermetropia was 42
(IQR, 26-49) years, most reported use at younger than 20
years (20.4%) or from 40 to younger than 60 years (64.0%),
which reflected childhood hypermetropia or the onset of
presbyopia in midlife with the associated age-related hyper-
opic shift in refractive error, with or without preexisting mild
hypermetropia (Figure 1B). In participants with hypermetro-
pia, median SE varied by first age at use of optical correction
from 4.16 (IQR, 2.56-5.88) D in those younger than 10 years to
1.75 (IQR, 1.33-2.43) D in those 40 years or older. Among par-
ticipants with high or moderate hypermetropia, 45.6%
started to wear glasses at younger than 20 years, whereas
76.2% of those with mild hypermetropia started wearing
glasses at 40 years or older (Table 3). The correlation coeffi-
cients between the age at first use of optical correction and
mean SE were 0.55 (P < .001) and −0.38 (P < .001) for myopia
or hypermetropia, respectively.
The receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted
separately for myopia and hypermetropia (Figure 2A and C).
The AUC for myopia was 0.829 (95% CI, 0.826-0.831), with a
threshold of age at first use of optical correction at 28 years giv-
ingthebestsensitivity(83.9%;95%CI,83.5%-84.3%)andspeci-
ficity (77.3%; 95% CI, 77.0%-77.7%) for myopia.
The AUC for hypermetropia was 0.612 (95% CI, 0.607-
0.615), which indicated poor prediction of hypermetropia with
the age at first use of optical correction. Similar poor predic-
tive value was obtained by plotting receiver operating char-
acteristic curves by selecting the participants’age at first use
of optical correction use at younger than 30 years or 30 years
or older, which is the threshold indicated by the age distribu-
tion in those with hypermetropia (eFigure 2A-C in the
Supplement).
Accuracy of Self-reported Age at First Use
and Reason for Use of Optical Correction
The AUC for myopia was improved to 0.928 (95% CI, 0.926-
0.930) with the addition of information on the reason for the
use of optical correction (Figure 2B). Overall, the AUC for hy-
permetropia was 0.713 (95% CI, 0.709-0.716) with the addi-
tional information (Figure 2D); however, in the subsample of
participants with the age at first use of optical correction at 30
years or younger, the AUC was 0.781 (95% CI, 0.774-0.788)
(eFigure 2B in the Supplement).
Discussion
In this UK adult population, self-report of the reason for and
age at first use of optical correction was found to have good
accuracy for identification of myopia (threshold, −1.00 D or
more extreme) compared with SE (autorefraction) in the more
extreme eye as the gold standard, with the accuracy being im-
proved if this information was combined. Overall prediction
of hypermetropia was poor; however, the accuracy improved
when only those 30 years or younger at first use of optical cor-
rection were included.
We found an association between age at first use of opti-
cal correction, used as a proxy for age of onset, and severity
of myopia and hypermetropia, which is consistent with prior
research.12 Further direct comparison with other studies is not
straightforward because of the use of different direct or indi-
rect questions to elicit reasons for the use of optical correc-
tion or the use of examination of prescribed distance glasses
to identify those with refractive error and because of the use
of prescription data or autorefraction measures as the gold
standard. In addition, no consensus in epidemiologic studies
on optimal definitions of myopia or hypermetropia exists,
which affects the prevalence and sensitivity and specificity
estimations.6,9,10,13,14

 Despite the scale and size of the UK Biobank Study, some
limitations should be noted. Identification of refractive error
basedonself-reportofprescribedopticalcorrectionmeantthat
participants with undiagnosed (and therefore untreated) re-
fractive error would be misclassified. However, in the United
Kingdom, those with undiagnosed refractive error in this age
group are likely to have mild late-onset myopia, as are those
who wore glasses previously but no longer required them.
Thus,mostindividualswithaprimaryrefractiveerrorwillhave
been identified by the lead question on the use of glasses or
contact lenses. Refractive error status in individuals was as-
signed based on the more extreme eye to avoid misclassifica-
tion of those with anisometropia, which occurs when using the
mean SE of 2 eyes. Finally, the self-report questions used in
the UK Biobank Study were intended to categorize refractive
status as a categorical variable, in keeping with norms in
classic and life-course epidemiology. Separate questions about
the reasons for the first use and current use of optical correc-
tion are needed to account for refractive shift (hypermetro-
pic or myopic) in later adult life. In genetic epidemiology, ana-
lyzing refraction as a continuous quantitative trait has an
advantage, but self-report could nevertheless be useful as a
means of identifying individuals eligible for further detailed
assessment.
Of those who reported use of optical correction for myo-
pia, 9.8% actually had hypermetropia; conversely, 8.4% of

 those who reported use of optical correction for hypermetro-
pia had myopia. More than 20% of participants with misclas-
sified myopia and hypermetropia were older adults who also
reported use of optical correction for presbyopia, which could
have led to some confusion in their reports of the reason for
their current prescription. In addition, a small number of in-
dividuals may have reported their refractive error status in-
correctly. Most participants with misclassified diagnoses had
a mild refractive error and reported first use of optical correc-
tion as young adults rather than during childhood. Thus, the
wording of questions in this survey, with an explanation of
terms, identified most of those with primary myopia and more
severe hypermetropia.
Sensitivity and specificity of self-report for the identifica-
tionofmyopiainthepresentstudywerecomparablewiththose
reported in 2 prior studies using similar questions.13,15 Those
studies included younger adults, had lower thresholds for defi-
nition of myopia (−0.5 D or worse13 and <0 D15), and used the
participant’
s worn spectacle prescription as the gold standard
rather than measuring actual refraction.3 Sensitivity and speci-
ficitywere89%and83%,respectively,forIpetal13and83%and
93%, respectively, for Breslin et al.15 Accuracy of self-report for
identification of hypermetropia has consistently been found to
bepoor,10,13,15withspecificityofself-reportofthereasonforop-
ticalcorrectiongenerallyhigherthansensitivity.However,high
specificitydoesnotcompensateforlowsensitivitieswhenself-
report is used as a screening tool in population studies to iden-
tify participants for further assessment.
A previous study10 reported that physical examination of
glasses by nonexpert examiners to assign lenses as magnify-
ing or minimizing is effective in categorizing (but not quanti-
fying) refractive status. However, the method is limited by the
need for additional data collection time and training of non-
specialist assessors and by failure to capture undiagnosed re-
fractiveerrororsolecontactlensuse.Spectacleprescriptiondata
have also been used to validate self-report of refractive status13
but are susceptible to bias in those with available data, the time
lag between testing and reporting of the prescription, and the
clinical scenario in which a prescription is intentionally dif-
ferent from the actual refraction. Sensitivity of self-report is
lowest for questions using lay rather than technical terms (ie,
short- and long-sightedness); respondents appear to find this
confusing, leading to high misclassification rates.9,10 How-
ever, parental report of eye problems and diagnosed eye disor-
ders in their children can include accurate medical terminol-
ogy and lead to prevalence estimates directly comparable with
those of clinical studies.16 Use of the internet by parents or pa-
tients to research suspected or diagnosed conditions has led to
more widespread use of medical terminology.17
Thisstudyandthosebyotherinvestigators12havefoundthe
age at first use of optical correction—a proxy for age at on-
set—to be associated with severity of myopia and hypermetro-
pia. Thus, using self-report of age at first use of optical correc-
tioncombinedwithself-reportofrefractiveerrorstatusislikely
to be the most effective method for identifying myopia and hy-
permetropia (although less effective for hypermetropia) in the

hancement Resources) initiative (http://www.closer.ac.uk/).
Conclusions
Using self-report questions on the reason for use and the age
at first use of optical correction and, ideally, a combination of
the two, is a feasible and accurate way to identify individuals
with myopia in an adult population. This approach is less ac-
curate for hypermetropia. The utility of self-report of refrac-
tive error relates to the nature of the research and the degree
to which any misclassification would affect and is dependent
on the precise wording of the questions. The scope to de-
velop concensus for a set of questions that could be imple-
mented effectively in large-scale generic population-based
studies exists; doing so would increase the opportunities for
integrated research on refractive error that are necessary to de-
velop novel prevention or treatment strategies.
