Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) increases C-peptide levels 
and induces insulin independence in patients with type 1 diabetes. This study aimed to 
investigate how clinical outcomes may associate with the immunological status, espe-
cially concerning the balance between immunoregulation and autoreactivity. Twenty-one 
type 1 diabetes patients were monitored after AHSCT and assessed every 6 months for 
duration of insulin independence, C-peptide levels, frequencies of islet-specific autore-
active CD8+ T cells (CTL), regulatory lymphocyte subsets, thymic function, and T-cell 
repertoire diversity. In median follow-up of 78 (range 15–106) months, all patients became 
insulin-independent, resuming insulin after median of 43 (range 6–100) months. Patients 
were retrospectively divided into short- or prolonged-remission groups, according to 
duration of insulin independence. For the entire follow-up, CD3+CD4+ T-cell numbers 
remained lower than baseline in both groups, whereas CD3+CD8+ T-cell levels did not 
change, resulting in a CD4/CD8 ratio inversion. Memory CTL comprehended most of T 
cells detected on long-term follow-up of patients after AHSCT. B cells reconstituted to 
baseline levels at 2–3 months post-AHSCT in both patient groups. In the prolonged-re-
mission-group, baseline islet-specific T-cell autoreactivity persisted after transplantation, 
but regulatory T cell counts increased. Patients with lower frequencies of autoreactive 
islet-specific T cells remained insulin-free longer and presented greater C-peptide levels 
than those with lower frequencies of these cells. Therefore, immune monitoring identified 
a subgroup of patients with superior clinical outcome of AHSCT. Our study shows that 
improved immunoregulation may balance autoreactivity endorsing better metabolic

Immune Mechanisms of AHSCT in Type 1 Diabetes

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from T cell-mediated autoimmune 
destruction of β-cells from pancreatic islets, leading to insulin 
deficiency and hyperglycemia (1, 2). Beta cell destruction pre-
cedes overt diabetes in several months or years, and at diagnosis 
residual β-cells are still viable (3). In the past decades, several 
immunomodulatory clinical studies have attempted to modulate 
insulitis, aiming to preserve the remaining mass of β cells and the 
endogenous insulin production. Most studies showed little influ-
ence on β-cell function, at most keeping C-peptide levels stable 
while patients were under temporary immunosuppressive effects 
(4–16). In these studies, no discontinuation of exogenous insulin 
injections was reported during 1–2 years follow-up.
Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) 
has been investigated as a therapeutic approach for autoim-
mune diseases (17, 18). High dose immunosuppression, usually 
associated with T cell-specific depleting methods, is followed by 
infusion of previously cryopreserved autologous hematopoietic 
stem cells (HCS). In 2003, our group started a pioneer study on 
AHSCT for T1D. Recently, diagnosed patients underwent severe 
immunosuppression, aiming to preserve and perhaps improve 
β-cell function. Indeed, 21 out of 25 transplanted patients became 
insulin free after the procedure (19, 20).
The rationale involves “immune resetting,” which comprises 
non-specific abrogation of autoreactive T- and B-cell responses 
followed by successful reconstitution of a tolerant immune system 
(21–24). Key to the therapeutic success of AHSCT is to improve 
the immunoregulatory mechanisms, shifting the balance from 
autoimmunity to tolerance, therefore interrupting autoimmune 
destruction.
We herein describe updated clinical outcome and immune 
monitoring results of 21 type 1 diabetes patients treated with 
AHSCT, with median follow-up of 78 (range 15–106) months. 
Subjects presented different profiles of glycemic control after 
AHSCT. We were therefore able to identify two groups of 
patients, according to duration of insulin independence. In 
addition to C-peptide levels, patterns of immune reconstitution, 
thymic function, T-cell repertoire, and frequency of islet-specific 
autoreactive CD8+ T cells (CTL) were evaluated, aiming to 
detect immunological markers associated with different clinical 
outcomes after AHSCT.

study Design and Patients
This clinical trial has been registered at http://clinicaltrials.gov 
(identifier: NCT00315133) and conducted in accordance with 
good clinical practice guidelines and approved by the institu-
tional review board of the Ribeirão Preto Medical School of the 
University of São Paulo, Brazil (Comitê de Ética em Pesquisa 
do HCFMRP-USP, No 10095/2002). Written informed consent 
was received from each participant, in accordance with the 
Declaration of Helsinki, prior to inclusion in the study. A data 
safety monitoring board and an independent medical monitor 
provided additional study oversight.
Twenty-five newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes patients fulfilled 
inclusion criteria and agreed to participate in this phase 2, 
single-arm, open-label AHSCT clinical trial and were prospec-
tively followed-up for mean (SD) of 67.5 (26.9) months (19, 20) 
(Figure 1). Data from the first 23 patients have been previously 
described, as well as detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria (19, 
20). Here, we report extended follow-up, including two additional 
patients.
Patients with less than 6 weeks of clinically diagnosed T1D 
and positive anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibody 
levels had their HSC mobilized with 2 g/m2 cyclophosphamide 
and G-CSF and harvested through leukapheresis. Subsequently, 
patients were treated with 200 mg/kg cyclophosphamide plus 
4.5 mg/kg rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG, Genzyme, 
USA), followed by infusion of unmanipulated, cryopreserved 
autologous HSC. Insulin doses were gradually reduced according 
to glycemic levels, aiming for glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) 
of less than 7%, and fasting and 2 h after meal glucose levels of 
120 and 140 mg/dL, respectively. Before and periodically after 
AHSCT, patients were evaluated, clinical data were registered, 
and blood samples were drawn for hematologic, metabolic, and 
immunological evaluations. Mean area under the curve (AUC) 
of C-peptide levels was measured during mixed-meal tolerance 
test, at baseline, 6 months and yearly after transplantation. From 
25 patients, four were treated off-protocol and 21 were retrospec-
tively analyzed for immunological parameters. The cohort of 21 
patients was divided into upper and lower 50th percentile, based 
on duration of insulin freedom (Figure 1; Table 1).
immunophenotypic analyses
Peripheral whole blood samples (150 µL) from 21 patients were 
immunophenotyped by flow cytometry, with previously titrated 
monoclonal antibodies (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA, 
EUA; Figures S1–S3 in Supplementary Material). Cells were ana-
lyzed with BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton-
Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA, EUA). Gating strategies are shown 
(Table S1 in Supplementary Material). Thirty-thousand events 
per sample were acquired for each subset and 100,000 events for 
immunoregulatory T cells. Results were expressed as absolute cell 
numbers (cells per microliter).
outcomes in patients with lower frequencies of islet-specific T cells. Development of 
new strategies of AHSCT is necessary to increase frequency and function of T and B 
regulatory cells and decrease efficiently autoreactive islet-specific T and B memory cells 
in type 1 diabetes patients undergoing transplantation.

T-cell receptor excision circles (Trecs)
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 18 patients 
were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque™ density gradient centrifuga-
tion (Amersham-Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). DNA was puri-
fied using DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, 
USA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. DNA 
was diluted to concentration of 100 ng/μL and used for quantifi-
cation of TREC molecules (25). Absolute quantification of TRECs 
(target gene) and albumin (endogenous gene control) in PBMCs 
was performed by real-time PCR, using TaqMan® reagents and 
7500 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, 
CA, USA). For each real-time PCR reaction, standard curves of 
TREC and endogenous genes were prepared. Plasmids contain-
ing TREC or albumin genes were kindly provided by Dr. Ngai 
Ka-Leung (Northwestern University, EUA). All experiments 
were performed in duplicates. The number of TREC molecules 
from each sample was divided by the number of endogenous 
gene copies (for normalization). Results were expressed as TREC 
molecules/100 ng DNA.
analysis of T-cell repertoire Diversity
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 21 patients were 
isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque™ density gradient centrifugation 
(Amersham-Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). RNA was purified 
using Pure Link Mini Kit (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, 
CA, USA). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from 
RNA using High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit 
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), according to the 
manufacturer’s recommendations. For further TCRBV CDR3 
Length Spectratyping, TCR βV-βC segments were first PCR 
amplified with specific primers for the 24 variable TCR regions (24 
βV families) and with one specific primer for the constant region 
of the TCR (βC primer), as described elsewhere (26, 27). The 
product from the first reaction underwent another PCR amplifi-
cation (elongation or run-off reaction) that included an internal 
fluorescent βC primer. The segment containing the CDR3 region 
of the TCR was amplified (26, 27). Run-off reaction products 
were submitted to electrophorectic run in an automated DNA 
sequencer (ABI 3500xL Genetic Analyzer, Applied Biosystems, 
Foster City, CA, USA). Data were analyzed by Gene Mapper™ 
software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), and distri-
bution graphs of CDR3 segments were generated (26, 27). Graphs 
represent fluorescence intensity in arbitrary units according to 
the size of the CDR3 region in base pairs. Considering that the 
positions of the βV and βC primers are fixed, the size of PCR 
product labeled βV-βC depends on the size of the VDJ junction 
of each specific TCR. The size of CDR3 segment with 10 amino 
acid residues for each Vβ has been previously estimated (26, 27).
We then calculated the diversity of the TCR repertoire by the 
complexity score (CS) (28). Each Vβ family was classified from 
0 to 8, based on the degree of TCR complexity/diversity. A score 
of 0 was given if the Vβ family was absent, of 1 if the Vβ family 
presented only one CDR3 peak, of 2 if the family presented two 
peaks, and subsequently. The score 8 was given to a spectratype 
with 8 or more peaks. The overall CS was calculated by the sum 
of the CSs of each Vβ family (28).

human β2M were solubilized and injected together with each 
synthetic peptide into a refolding buffer. Multimeric pMHC 
complexes were produced by addition of streptavidin-conjugated 
Qdots (Invitrogen, Breda, The Netherlands) to achieve a 1:20 
streptavidin-Qdot/biotinylated pMHC ratio. Qdot-585, -605, 
-655, -705, and -800 were used. PBMCs from HLA-A2 positive 
subjects were stained with a mixture containing six HLA-A2-
associated diabetes epitopes (Table 2). Cells (2 × 106) were stained 
simultaneously with all Qdot-labeled pMHC multimers (0.1 µg 
of each). Subsequently, 10 µL allophycocyanin-labeled anti-CD8 
and 10 µL fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-CD4, -CD14, 
-CD16, -CD20, and -CD40 antibodies (Becton Dickinson, 
Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) were added. Cells were resuspended 
in PBS/0.5% BSA containing 7-aminoactinomycin-D (7-AAD; 
eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) to exclude dead cells and 
analyzed using the LSRII (Becton Dickinson).
Data analysis
Patients were retrospectively divided into two groups, based 
on duration of insulin independence. The median was chosen 
as cut point because it dissected the patients into two groups 
of equal size who presented sustained vs short-lived response 
to therapy. Patients above the median duration of insulin 
independence were named “long-remission group” and those 
below, “short-remission group.” Further data analyses were 
performed in each of the subgroups, as well as in the undivided 
cohort of patients. For each patient, in the respective periods, 
C-peptide levels were calculated by mean AUC, which was 
estimated by the trapezium rule. The linear regression mixed 
model was used to analyze data from AUC, immune reconsti-
tution, and frequency of autoreactive CTL (29). This method 
allowed for multiple longitudinal observations per individual 
across a baseline period, and subsequent time points after 
transplantation. The linear mixed models are composed of 
random and fixed effects. This model applies for analysis of 
data on which responses are grouped (more than one measure 
to the same individual), and the assumption of independence 
between observations in the same group is not adequate. The 
fixed effects are groups and periods. The random effects are 
associated with patients, since it is necessary to control cor-
relations between repeated measures. For variable frequency, 
we used a logarithmic transformation to fit the data to the 
proposed model. Kaplan–Meier method was used to calculate 
insulin-free survival curve. Data analysis was performed using 
SAS®9.0 statistical software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, 
USA). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.

ahscT induces long-term insulin 
independence and increases c-Peptide 
levels
Twenty-five patients were enrolled between November 2003 and 
April 2010, and followed until 2014. Patient characteristics have 
been reported previously (19, 20) and are summarized (Table 1; 
Table S2 in Supplementary Material; Figure 1). Two patients had 
presented with ketoacidosis at diagnosis, and two others inadvert-
ently received steroids during transplant procedure (Figure 1; 
Table S3 in Supplementary Material). These off-protocol patients 
were excluded from immunological analyses, allowing us to study 
a more homogeneous group of patients, with similar clinical 
and metabolic characteristics and also treated under the same 
transplant protocol. In fact, these four patients did not experi-
ence any period of insulin freedom after AHSCT. Details on this 
subpopulation of patients have been published (19, 20).
In the remaining patients, insulin doses were progressively 
reduced after AHSCT, based on glycemic levels, until complete 
suspension. Twenty-one patients became insulin free for median 
of 43 months (6–100 months) after AHSCT, and three of these 
patients are still continuously free from insulin (Table 1; Table 
S4 in Supplementary Material). Ten patients remained insulin 
free for less than 3.5 years after AHSCT and thus were named 
“short-remission group.” Eleven patients persisted insulin free 
for at least 3.5 years, therefore labeled “prolonged-remission 
group.” From 30 to 42 months of follow-up, there was no change 
in insulin use status, whether patients being were insulin free or 
insulin-dependent (Table S4 in Supplementary Material). This 
observation indicates the different profiles of each group, short-
term and long-term responders, and reinforces the importance 
of investigating possible mechanistic differences between groups.
Mean (SD) AUC of C-peptide levels significantly increased 
from baseline compared with 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months post-
AHSCT (Figures 2A,B; Table S5 in Supplementary Material). 
Furthermore, although at 60 and 72 months most patients had 
already resumed insulin, C-peptide levels were similar than those 
from before transplant. Moreover, when compared with baseline, 
the prolonged-remission group presented significant increase 
of C-peptide levels from 6 to 60 months after AHSCT, while

the short-remission group showed stabilized C-peptide levels 
along same follow-up (Figure 2B; Figure S4 in Supplementary 
Material).
Baseline autoreactivity Predicts clinical 
Outcomes after ahscT
The profile of pancreas-infiltrating lymphocytes is partly mirrored 
in the peripheral blood of patients (29). Islet-autoreactive CTL 
have been detected in insulitic lesions from patients diagnosed 
with TID (30). These data indicate that measuring islet-specific 
CTL in peripheral blood may represent an excellent biomarker 
for treatment intervention. Thus, we first evaluated whether 
autoreactive islet-specific CD8+ T cell (aCTL) frequencies were 
associated with clinical outcomes of transplanted patients.
Cumulative frequencies of islet-specific CTL recognizing six 
different islet epitopes were determined over time (Figure 3; 
Table S6 in Supplementary Material). We did not detect sig-
nificant changes in aCTL frequencies following transplantation 
(Figure 3A). Subsequently, cumulative frequencies of aCTLs 
were divided into upper and lower 50th percentile, clustering 
patients according to the CD8+ T-cell autoreactivity at base-
line (Figure 3B; Table S7 in Supplementary Material). Initial 
frequencies only minimally changed after AHSCT, indicat-
ing that the conditioning regimen was not able to eliminate 
aCTLs (Figure 3C). Patients with higher CTL autoreactivity 
before AHSCT maintained significantly elevated cumulative 
frequencies of aCTLs up to 24 months after transplantation. 
Moreover, patients with low CTL autoreactivity demonstrated 
higher C-peptide levels after AHSCT (Figure 3D; Table S8 in 
Supplementary Material).
Further analyses of insulin-free patients indicated that those 
with higher cumulative aCTL frequencies at baseline relapsed 
earlier post-AHSCT than patients with lower autoreactivity 
(p = 0.007; Figure 3E). Indeed, all patients with lower islet 
autoreactivity at baseline remained free from insulin for at least 
24 months after AHSCT, while 83% of patients with higher 
baseline levels of islet autoreactivity had already relapsed at this 
time point (Figure 3E). In summary, our data show that baseline 
cumulative frequency of aCTLs predicts duration of insulin 
independency after AHSCT in T1D patients.
We next evaluated the dynamics of aCTL frequencies in the 
short- and prolonged-remission groups after AHSCT. Those 
remaining insulin free for longer periods had persistently lower 
frequencies of aCTLs that differed significantly at 6 and 12 months 
posttransplant (Figure 3F).
Thymic Function reactivation after ahscT
Once AHSCT did not affect specific islet autoreactivity, we 
searched for other immunological mechanisms that might be 
involved in the control of β-cell destruction. Thymic produc-
tion of naive T-cell populations (recent-thymic emigrants) was 
determined through analysis of signal-joint T-cell receptor 
excision circles. In our cohort of 21 patients, TREC levels were 
lower than baseline at 3 months, normalized at 12 months, and 
increased from 18 to 60 months after AHSCT (Figure 4A; Figure 
S5A and Table S9 in Supplementary Material). Concurrently, 
the T-cell repertoire diversity as defined by the CS was sus-
tained until 24 months (Figure 4B; Figure S5B and Table S10 
in Supplementary Material), progressively declining after 
30 months post-AHSCT.
sustained cD4/cD8 inversion after ahscT
Lymphopenia was observed following transplantation in both 
groups, reflecting the immunosuppressive effect of the proce-
dure (Figures S6A,B in Supplementary Material). We examined 
whether T- and B-cell subset reconstitution was associated 
with metabolic control of patients (Figure S6 in Supplementary 
Material). For the entire follow-up, CD3+CD4+ T-cell numbers 
remained lower than baseline in both groups (Figure S6C in 
Supplementary Material), whereas CD3+CD8+ T-cell levels did 
not change, resulting in a CD4/CD8 ratio inversion (Figures 
S6D,E in Supplementary Material). B cells reconstituted to 
baseline levels approximately 2–3 months post-AHSCT in both 
patient groups (Figure S6F in Supplementary Material).
We also investigated whether clinical response to AHSCT 
was associated with imbalanced distribution of memory T-cell

subsets. In both patient groups, reconstitution to baseline 
numbers of central-memory CD4+ (CD4+TCM) cells was not 
detected throughout follow-up (Figure 5A), while overall 
central-memory CD8+ (CD8+TCM) cell counts increased at 2 
and 3 months post-AHSCT, decreasing after 54 and 60 months 
(Figure 5B). The short-remission group had higher effector-
memory CD4+ (CD4+TEM) cell counts at 2–9 months post-
transplantation when compared with the prolonged-remission 
group (Figure 5C), while the prolonged-remission group 
presented higher CD8+TCM values at 30, 36, and 60 months 
posttransplantation than the short-remission group. In both 
groups, effector-memory CD8+ (CD8+TEM) cell counts raised 
early after AHSCT (Figure 5D). In summary, memory CTL 
comprehended most of T cells detected on long-term follow-up 
of patients after AHSCT, indicating that the immunosuppres-
sive regimen may not sufficiently target potentially autoreactive 
and pathogenic memory T cells.
ahscT increases regulatory T-cell 
counts
Considering that total CD8 T cells were elevated after transplant, 
especially in those patients with longer clinical remission, we 
investigated the dynamics of CD8+CD28−CD57+ T cells post-
AHSCT, due to their potential to decrease activity of autoreactive 
T cells (31). The prolonged-remission group showed increased 
numbers of CD8+CD28−CD57+ T cells at 6, 12, 30, and 42 months 
posttransplantation, compared with baseline levels, while the 
short-remission group showed elevated CD8+CD28−CD57+

cell counts only at 18 months post-AHSCT (Figure 6A). The 
percentage of CD8+CD28−CD57+ cells was increased from 6 
to 42 months after transplantation (Figure 6C). Thus, during 
early years post-AHSCT, CD8+CD28−CD57+ and CD8+TCM cell 
subsets constituted most of the T cells, especially in patients that 
presented better response to transplantation.
Next, we evaluated the reconstitution of CD4+CD25hiFoxP3+ 
regulatory T cells (Tregs) after AHSCT (32). At baseline, the 
short-remission group had higher absolute Treg numbers 
than the prolonged-remission group. However, after trans-
plantation, the percentage and absolute numbers of Tregs 
significantly increased in the prolonged-remission group only 
(Figures 6B,D). Altogether, these data show that expansion of 
immunoregulatory T cells is associated with higher metabolic 
responsiveness to AHSCT, possibly by temporary reestablish-
ment of self-tolerance.
DiscUssiOn
Most patients in this study became insulin free for 3.5 years 
after transplantation and presented significant increments of 
C-peptide levels. This is different from the natural history of T1D 
and seems consonant with the hypothesis that a broad immu-
nosuppressive approach could satisfactory control autoimmunity 
in diabetes (19, 20). In spite of not being a controlled trial, the 
longitudinal analysis and correlations among time free from 
insulin, frequency of islet-specific autoreactive CTLs and immu-
noregulatory mechanisms may guide future research protocols 
on the immunotherapies for T1D.
Our study demonstrates that although thymic reactivation was 
achieved, islet autoreactivity persisted after AHSCT. Nevertheless, 
most patients became insulin free and C-peptide levels remained 
higher than initial values for at least 4 years post-AHSCT, indicat-
ing temporary immunological balance and β-cell preservation. 
We contend that these results outweigh those of most immune 
intervention studies attempting to protect β cells in newly diag-
nosed T1D patients, while at best only delaying progressive loss 
of β-cell function, rather than improving endogenous insulin 
production (21).
Immunological mechanisms of AHSCT for autoimmune 
diseases have been described (22, 33–38). Here, we further 
contributed to the field by unraveling novel immune correlates 
associated with better metabolic responsiveness of type 1 diabetes 
patients to AHSCT: decreased effector-memory CD4+ T cells, 
expansion of immunoregulatory T cells, and lower frequencies of 
islet-specific autoreactive CTLs.
Shortly after AHSCT, patient’s immune reconstitution 
predominantly relies on peripheral homeostatic expansion 
of lymphocytes that survived the highly immunosuppressive 
regimen or that were reinfused with the stem cell graft (35, 36). 
A subpopulation of these cells may be effector-memory auto-
reactive cells and possibly associated with disease reactivation. 
Therefore, a fundamental step of AHSCT is proper elimination 
of the lymphoid compartment and consequent lymphopenia, 
which is essential to eradicate pathogenic autoreactive lympho-
cytes and thus abrogate autoimmune aggression to pancreatic 
β cells (21). However, in our study, we did not detect efficient 
elimination of memory T-cell subsets, including autoreactive 
CTLs. Yet, a subset of patients, mostly those in the lower 50th 
percentile of islet autoreactivity, presented better metabolic 
outcome, indicating that the detrimental effect of autoreactive 
CTL persistence might be counterbalanced by other immune 
mechanisms.
Thymic rebound, defined by volumetric enlargement and 
functional reactivation of the thymus following lymphoid deple-
tion, has been previously reported after AHSCT (25, 34, 37). It 
may be measured by recovery of naive T-cell numbers and TREC 
levels (23, 37). Indeed, we show that TREC levels are decreased in 
both groups at 3 months, starting to increase again at 18 months 
after AHSCT, until the end of follow-up.

The diversity of the T-cell repertoire, however, presented a dif-
ferent pattern. Our results are in accordance with previous studies 
that demonstrated the reconstitution of a new and diverse T-cell 
repertoire in autoimmune patients up to 3 years after AHSCT (22, 
34, 37). However, a late and gradual decline of the T-cell reper-
toire diversity occurred, indicating that a peripheral oligoclonal 
expansion of memory T cells, including autoreactive clones, may 
have surmounted the production of recent thymic emigrants.
Collectively, our results suggest that a diverse immune system 
was reconstituted in type 1 diabetes patients up to 30 months after 
AHSCT, contributing to temporary pancreatic β-cell preserva-
tion and insulin independence. However, after this time point, 
the overall diversity of the T-cell repertoire decreased and most of 
the long-lasting insulin-free patients resumed insulin, indicating 
that additional immune mechanisms might be operating and/or 
that the genetic background might have influenced the outcome. 
Despite the role of environmental factors as triggers for autoim-
mune diseases, the complexity of genetic predisposition might 
determine individual response to AHSCT and/or be responsible 
for late relapse of the disease (33).
In this setting, Tregs may have an important role in rees-
tablishing self-tolerance and inducing long-term remissions 
after AHSCT (24, 32, 39, 40). Indeed, in short-term follow-up, 
infusions of Tregs decreased insulin requirements in six out of 
eight patients, two of which became insulin free (41). In our 
study, increased Tregs were only observed after AHSCT in the 
prolonged-remission group. It is known that Tregs modulate acti-
vated effector cells during early stages of antigen reexperiencing 
after transplantation, promoting self-tolerance (42). They may 
also inhibit spontaneous autoreactive proliferation in lympho-
penic environments (43). In our study, patients’ insulin free for 
longer periods presented higher C-peptide levels, higher Treg 
numbers, and lower autoreactive CTL frequencies, suggesting 
that Tregs might have played a role in controlling autoimmunity. 
In the highly islet-reactive patients, however, immune regula-
tory mechanisms might have been insufficient to restrain β-cell

destruction. Our data suggest that memory autoreactive CTLs 
were not satisfactorily depleted by the conditioning regimen and 
probably underwent peripheral expansion. This interpretation is 
supported by similar findings from a clinical trial assessing ATG 
therapy in new-onset T1D patients (13). Drugs more effectively 
targeting memory T cells may improve remission rates and 
preserve β-cell function. In fact, an elegant study showed that 
anti-CD2 antibody depletes central- and effector-memory cells, 
contributing to slower rate of β-cell destruction (14).
In accordance with the literature (34, 39), we observed expan-
sion of CD8+CD28−CD57+ cells after AHSCT, a CD8+ subpopula-
tion with immunosuppressive and immunoregulatory properties. 
Our work is the first to demonstrate that higher responsiveness 
to AHSCT and consequent insulin independence in T1D patients 
may be related to in vivo expansion of immunoregulatory cells. 
We recognize that functional assays with immunoregulatory cell 
subsets would be important to verify their suppressive capacity 
also in vitro. These investigations are planned for future studies.
Importantly, we were able to identify an immune correlate of 
treatment efficacy, as patients with low frequencies of autoreac-
tive CTLs before transplant remained independent of insulin 
injections longer than patients with high frequencies these cells. 
Type 1 diabetes represents a heterogeneous disease in terms of 
low and high autoreactive T-cell frequencies, and therapeutic effi-
cacy differs between patient subsets. Indeed, in the setting of islet 
transplantation, the rate of baseline cellular islet autoimmunity 
predicts clinical outcomes (29, 44). These data show that meas-
urement of autoreactive CTL frequency in the peripheral blood 
may be useful to predict which group of patients will benefit most 
from the current transplant conditioning scheme and which may 
require more intense strategies.
Our study demonstrates encouraging metabolic outcomes in 
recent-diagnosed type 1 patients. Similar results were achieved 
by other independent centers, as well as by a preclinical study 
(45–50). It is known that C-peptide levels inversely correlate with 
the incidence of diabetic nephropathy, neuropathy, and hypogly-
cemia (44). We show that mean C-peptide levels remained higher 
than baseline long after transplant, indicating persistent effects of 
AHSCT on disease pathogenesis and possibly on the long-term 
outcome of these patients.
The main target of AHSCT for autoimmune diseases is to 
achieve immunological tolerance, which results from balance 
between autoreactivity and immunoregulatory mechanisms, in 
the context of a newly regenerated immune system. Nevertheless, 
new strategies are desired to boost T and B regulatory cell 
mechanisms and/or more efficiently eliminate autoreactive

T and B memory cells in the AHSCT setting (14). To address 
this issue, new protocols of AHSCT for newly diagnosed T1D 
should be developed, including a three-drug immunosuppressive 
regimen (cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, and rATG), aiming to 
hit the memory T and B cell compartment harder and improve 
treatment outcomes. In addition, evaluation of the B-cell subsets 
and their function in the AHSCT setting for type 1 diabetes and 
other autoimmune diseases is warranted and may support future 
therapeutic approaches.
