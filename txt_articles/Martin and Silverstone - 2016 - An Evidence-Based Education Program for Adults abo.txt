Here we describe the development of an evidence-based education program for adults
about childhood sexual abuse (CSA), called Prevent It! Uniquely, the primary goal of this
program was to change the behavior of participants, as well as to increase knowledge
about CSA and positive attitudes toward it. A comprehensive review shows no previous
similar approach. The program includes a detailed manual to allow standardized
administration by trained facilitators, as well as multiple video segments from CSA
survivors and professionals. A total of 23 program workshops were run, with 366 adults
participating. Of these, 312 (85%) agreed to take part in the study. All completed
baseline ratings prior to the program and 195 (63% of study sample) completed
follow-up assessments at 3-months. There were no significant differences between the
demographic make-up of the baseline group and the follow-up group. Assessments
included demographic data, knowledge, attitudes, and several measures of behavior (our
primary outcome variable). Behavioral questions asked individuals to select behaviors
used in the previous 3-months from a list of options. Questions also included asking
“how many times in the previous 3-months” have you “talked about healthy sexual
development or Child sexual abuse (CSA) with a child you know”; “suspected a child was
sexually abused”; “taken steps to protect a child”; or “reported suspected sexual abuse
to police or child welfare”? The majority of attendees were women, with the commonest
age group being between 30 and 39 years old. Approximately 33% had experienced CSA
themselves. At 3-month follow-up there were highly statistically significant improvements
in several aspects of behavior and knowledge, and attitudes regarding CSA. For example,
the number of subjects actively looking for evidence of CSA increased from 46% at
baseline to 81% at follow-up, while the number of subjects who actively took steps
to protect children increased from 25% at baseline to 48% at follow-up. For general
public adults, this is the first program designed using the current evidence base for
effective training in CSA examining longer-term outcomes and the first to focus on actual
behavioral outcomes. The results suggest it is highly effective and support its widespread
use.

Sexual Abuse Prevention for Adults
INTRODUCTION
Child sexual abuse (CSA) is common (Finkelhor, 1994; Pereda
et al., 2009), with as many as 1 in 6 girls and 1 in 12 boys
currently experiencing sexual abuse involving bodily contact
(Martin and Silverstone, 2013). It is uncertain if there are changes
in the rates of CSA in the United States (Finkelhor, 2009)
or Canada (Collin-Vézina et al., 2010), particularly given the
increase in use of internet pornography (Diamond et al., 2011;
Livingstone and Smith, 2014). Adults who experienced CSA have
higher rates of psychopathology (Chen et al., 2010) and are
at higher risk of a range of medical, psychological, behavioral,
and sexual disorders (Maniglio, 2009) than those who have
not been sexually abused. It is possible that these impacts are
mediated through changes in brain structures and functions
(Anda et al., 2006; Kaffman, 2009; Belsky and de Haan, 2011), as
well as neurobiological stress systems, with “child maltreatment
(being) a preventable contributor to child psychopathology,
cognitive impairment, and developmental difficulties” (Watts-
English et al., 2006).
Because of the frequent long-term impacts of CSA, preventing
it is of great importance. One method is to include a range
of people in prevention efforts including parents, professionals,
and the general public (Wurtele, 2009). Toward this end, it
is likely that adults who interact with children may be in the
best position to reduce children’s vulnerability to CSA, as well
as to reduce their vulnerability to negative impacts associated
with CSA. This is of value as positive adult support may
improve outcomes, helping children experience fewer negative
impacts than others (Yancey et al., 2011). It should also be
recognized that previous research into the possible effectiveness
of adult training programs has provided insight into knowledge
gain, attitude change, and behavioral intentions (Rheingold
et al., 2007; Self-Brown et al., 2008), but not on the key issue
of actual behavior changes in regards to CSA preventative
behaviors.
There is great variety in the types of prevention programs
that exists, their target groups, the methods, and their specific
contexts (Zollner et al., 2014). Despite this variety, there
are few CSA prevention programs targeting general public
adults that have been developed using a research informed
approach, and none to our knowledge that reflect recent
research findings. All such programs do need to be based on
current theoretical understandings of healthy child development
(Zeuthen and Hagelskjær, 2013). Furthermore, evidence-based
approaches that include policy, legislation, and services are
also currently lacking (Collin-Vézina et al., 2010). For this
reason, we believe that development of a novel program is
required, and here we report on such a program, titled:
Prevent It! Taking Action to Stop Child Sexual Abuse (Prevent
It!). In the current publication we describe the current
research background, the theoretical background, methodology
of development of the program, and the first study into it’s
effectiveness. In particular, we examined the extent to which a
classroom-based CSA prevention program for adults can change
participant’s longer-term behaviors, as well as attitudes and
knowledge.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethical and Personal Impact Consideration
This study was approved by the Ethics Board of the University
of Alberta. All participants completed informed consent prior
to any involvement in the program. All individuals were given
a unique study number, and this was the only identifier used to
collect all study-related information at a secure on-line site. To
ensure confidentiality for participants in a group setting we only
used first names, and also included a section in the introduction
of the program where the facilitator asks participants to respect
and maintain each other’s confidentiality.
Additionally, there is potential for the program to be
emotionally upsetting, and have a personal impact particularly
for those individuals who have themselves experienced CSA.
We therefore took several steps to address this concern. Firstly,
all participants were provided with a 24-h crisis line resource
to access, should they want to talk to someone outside their
own support system or get more information about professional
services. Secondly, the facilitators discussed this issue at the
start of the program, letting each participant know that the
program could be upsetting to them, or could bring up thoughts
and feelings that are difficult to manage. Thirdly, participants
were encouraged to use their own support system, if needed,
and were reminded of this at the start and end of the
program.
Program Development and Literature
Review
We reviewed literature related to CSA topics in order to
determine program content using the databases PubMed,
PsycINFO, and ERIC. In order to obtain an overview of the
topic we searched the databases using the following search
terms: “sexual abuse,” “rates,” “occurrence,” “epidemiology,”
“impact,” “signs,” “indicators,” “victim,” “survivor,” “offenders,”
“perpetrators,”
“disclosure,”
“education,”
“prevention,”
“reporting,” “parents,” “children,” “caregivers,” and “teachers.”
Current Situation
School-based, child targeted prevention programs have been
widely used in CSA education (Zwi et al., 2007; Wurtele, 2009;
Walsch et al., 2015). Accessing children directly through schools
allows educators to reach children from a wide range of socio-
economic and ethnic backgrounds (Wurtele, 2009). Targeting
children at school rather than relying on parents to provide the
information helps ensure children who are being abused in their
homes still have access to CSA education. The extent to which
schools are currently using this type of approach is yet to be
assessed in a systematic way (Wurtele, 2009). Literature reviews
(MacMillan et al., 2009; Fryda and Hulme, 2015) and meta-
analysis (Davis and Gidycz, 2000; Zwi et al., 2007; Walsch et al.,
2015) indicate child-targeted programs can increase children’s
knowledge, self-protective behaviors, and reporting behaviors
(MacMillan et al., 2009). While child-targeted CSA education
plays an important role in CSA prevention, adults may also be
a useful target group (Wurtele, 2009; Zeuthen and Hagelskjær,
2013).

Sexual Abuse Prevention for Adults
Of the adult-targeted education, research on caregivers is most
common (Berrick, 1988; Hébert et al., 2002; Rheingold et al.,
2007; Self-Brown et al., 2008; Kenny, 2009). Caregivers may
be in positions where they can rapidly identify CSA situations
and help at-risk or affected children (Hébert et al., 2002). It
should be noted that children’s disclosure of abuse is often a
process rather than a one-time event (Alaggia, 2004; Jenson
et al., 2005), and their caregivers can be in ideal positions
to respond to these disclosures. Nonetheless, a caregiver may
also be involved in perpetrating abuse (Public Health Agency
of Canada, 2010), making it necessary for adults outside the
home to also receive CSA education. In part for this reason,
it has been suggested (Wurtele, 2009) that non-caregiver adults
should also have CSA education, although these adults remain
the least studied group. Teachers have received slightly more
attention than other non-caregiver adults (Walsch et al., 2012),
and the potential effectiveness of media campaigns on general
adult populations has also been examined (Self-Brown et al.,
2008). The focus of many adult-targeted education programs has
been on changing knowledge and attitudes about CSA (Bowman
et al., 2010; Walsch et al., 2012), as well as behavioral intentions
with regard to responding to suspected CSA (Hébert et al., 2002;
Self-Brown et al., 2008). To our knowledge, there are no previous
studies that have examined actual changes in behavior after
training programs.
Adult-targeted CSA education programs use a variety of
formats to teach adults about CSA. One randomized controlled
study measured attitudes, knowledge, and behavioral intentions
after being exposed to media-based CSA materials founding
a significant increase in knowledge scores after exposure but
no significant change in attitude (Rheingold et al., 2007).
Another study used survey and focus group methods to evaluate
the effectives of public service announcements on knowledge
and likelihood of behavioral change, but while they found a
very short-term increase in knowledge, participants agreed this
approach was not enough to change behavior (Self-Brown et al.,
2008). The results from these studies suggest that a brief exposure
to CSA educational materials may increase knowledge in the
short-term, but not be sufficient to change behavior. One online
version of a CSA education program shows that professionals
(i.e., teachers, psychologist, and social workers) who interact
with children and youth regularly had significant gains in
CSA related empathy in the 6 months after taking the online
program (Man-Ging et al., 2015). Similarly, other classroom-
based studies show an increase in short-term knowledge as
well as increase appropriate behavioral intentions (Hébert et al.,
2002; Kenny, 2009; Bowman et al., 2010; Rheingold et al.,
2012). However, only one of these studies included follow-up
assessment beyond 1 month (Rheingold et al., 2015), and thus the
longer-term effectiveness of previous adult-targeted classroom-
based education is promising but far from certain. It is also
unclear if repeated information sessions, rather than a single
exposure, alters the effectiveness of education (Davis and Gidycz,
2000; Rheingold et al., 2007). According to the results of a
multi-site, randomized control trail study, adult-targeted CSA
education programs designed for childcare professionals can
increase knowledge and self-reported use of prevention behaviors
in both classroom and online versions (Rheingold et al., 2015).
There are no studies that show an increase in knowledge over
more than a 1-month period, and none that have examined actual
behavioral changes in general public adults. Given increasing
literature and knowledge about the most effective types of adult
education (Petty and Thomas, 2014; Taylor and Laros, 2014),
we developed a novel program education program targeting
general population adults (Prevent It!) to address this issue. We
also evaluated the program, with our primary outcome measure
focusing on behavior changes over a 3-month period.
Consultation and Theoretical Grounding
Taking into consideration the current situation, we consulted
with topic experts in order to assess current needs (and potential
gaps) in CSA education with a wide group of individuals.
These included members of the Police Services involved with
all aspects of CSA, psychologists working in the field of CSA,
charities involved in training, and with sexual assault centers.
Because our main outcome goal for the program was behavior
change, it was important to structure the program utilizing
methodology previously demonstrated to maximize likelihood
of subsequent behavioral changes. Although some studies have
shown changes in behavior intentions after taking an adult-
targeted CSA education program (Hébert et al., 2002; Rheingold
et al., 2007; Self-Brown et al., 2008; Paranal et al., 2012) and
one study measured self-report behavior change in childcare
professionals (Rheingold et al., 2015) we are unaware of any
studies measuring actual behavior changes in general public
adults. The lack of research means that little is known about
the key components required to change participant’s behavior
in regards to sexual prevention. For these reasons, we used
previously well-established models, namely the Transtheoretical
Model of change (TTM) (Diclemente et al., 1991; Diclemente
and Prochaska, 1998) and the Experiential Learning Cycle (Kolb,
1975) to develop the program.
The TTM approach to understanding behavior change
combines
all
components
into
a
single
cohesive
theory
(Diclemente and Prochaska, 1998). Although initially developed
to understand behavior in regards to addictions, the TTM is
useful in helping understand how adults change their behavior.
According to the TTM model, adults cycle through five stages
when changing their behavior. In (1) pre-contemplation, adults
are not yet considering the behavior change in question, while
in (2) contemplation, the person considers change but has not
yet decided to make the change. In (3) preparation, the person
prepares for, and plans for, making the change and in (4)
action, the individual starts making the change. Finally, in (5)
maintenance, the change has is made and is continued over a
longer period of time. The program was therefore designed to
facilitate the movement of participants through each subsequent
stage, and to assist them to reach the action (stage 4) and
maintenance (stage 5) phases of change.
The activities in the program were structured utilizing
methodology described in the Experiential Learning Cycle (ELC)
(Kolb, 1975). The ELC can be considered as a tool used to create
movement through the TTM. This cycle has 4 components:
(1) concrete experience, (2) reflective observation, (3) abstract

conceptualization, and (4) action/active experimentation. First,
the facilitator introduced a structured experience, such as playing
a video clip segment or directing participants to an activity
in the program. Experiences engage participants in ways that
relate to the program’s desired outcomes. They also provide
participants with a common base for discussion. Second, the
facilitator guides participants to reflect on the previous concrete
experience encouraging then to personalize the experience by
exploring their feelings about, reactions to, and observations of
the activity. Third, the facilitator poses “so what” and “now what”
questions to help participants look for personal lessons and future
applications. In this step participants make real-world meaning
of the activity by utilizing more general principals. Finally, the
facilitator helps participants explore ways in which they can
implement their learning in their own lives and organizations.
They are encouraged to think creatively about the ways in which
these leanings can be applied in their unique situations as well as
consider possible barriers to implementing changes. Utilizing the
well-validated TTM and the ELC ensured the strong theoretical
foundation for the program.
Content and Program Guides
Program content was determined after the detailed consultation
process, combined with regular communication and contact
with the range of stakeholders and also with experienced
trainers. A detailed “program guide” was developed, including
the rationale for each section, presented in an easy to understand
format written for a general audience. It provides all necessary
background information for the program content and approach.
The program guide is an 80-page document and was made
available to program staff.
A briefer “information book” was also developed for all
program participants, derived directly from the program guide,
to be used by all participants during the program, and
subsequently by them as reference material. During the program,
facilitators directed participants to the relevant sections of
the information books to engage in exercises throughout the
program, and used this to guide participants through the
exercises.
The program includes a significant video component, with
the group facilitator showing video segments throughout the
program. The facilitator introduces each section before showing
it, and after viewing each segment, there was a guided exercise
aimed to increase personal and critical reflection on the material.
Video sections include overall narration, interviews with experts
in the area, survivors of sexual abuse, and professionals who work
in related fields.
The survivor interviews provide personal accounts of sexual
abuse as well some of the impact of CSA on them in both
the shorter-term and longer-term. These interviews helped to
highlight the personal toll of CSA and remind participants
that CSA significantly impacts of range of different people in
multiple ways. In order to reduce the potential for harm to
people that might regret their decision to tell their story in the
educational video format, only CSA survivors who were already
publicly sharing their stories were approached to be involved.
All survivors were told in advance about the types of questions
they would be asked in the interview, and were told that they
were in control of the question answering process. They did not
need to answer all the questions if they did not want to, and they
were reminded that they could change their mind and decide not
to participate at any point in time during the video production
phase or subsequently.
Professionals working in fields related to sexual abuse were
also interviewed. Effort was taken to have a wide range of
professional voices represented. Interviews featured in the
film, in addition to CSA victims, include a psychologist and
Traumatologist, an experienced police detective involved in
many cases of CSA, a defense attorney, and a psychiatrist.
Facilitator Guide
The facilitator guide explained what was expected from the
facilitator at each point in the program workshop, with
information grouped around several themes. Table 1 outlines
program themes and topics. The program workshops were
designed to be given by community volunteers, rather than
specialists, to allow it to be generalizable. For this reason,
the Facilitator Guide was written in non-specialist language.
Additionally, this model allows for volunteers from a range
of communities to be trained and to return to their own
communities (and surrounding areas) to provide the program.
We believe this model can increase access to the program for
individuals in many areas, is scalable, and also practical for use
in remote and rural areas. In order to allow for volunteers to
facilitate the program consistently we created a highly detailed
guide for them to follow. The guide outlines what to say to
introduce each video segment and the subsequent exercises. It
also provides questions to prompt participant reflection, and
identifies key points that are to be emphasized or summarized
at the end of each exercise. In the present study we utilized
two individuals who received funding for running the program
workshops, and who had significant experience doing this
previously. To ensure fidelity across sessions, facilitators were
instructed to follow the script and guide closely during each
program workshop.
Program Evaluation
The target group was adults who interact with children,
including caregivers, teachers, coaches for sports and recreation
activities, youth group leaders, and religious leaders. This
study evaluated the effectiveness of the Prevent It! program
at changing adult participant’s behaviors 3-months after the
training session (the primary outcome goal), as well as improving
attitudes toward CSA and knowledge about this. A priori
hypotheses were that participants who took the workshop
would: (1) decrease adherence to problematic myths about
CSA (referred to as negative attitudes), (2) increase accurate
knowledge about CSA, and (3) increase their use of individual
and organizational prevention behaviors to reduce risk of
CSA and identify this early. One explicit long-term goal, not
studied in the current program, was that this program will help
with early identification, and appropriate interventions, of CSA
when it occurs. We hope to explore this issue in subsequent
research.

Sampling Strategy and Setting
We wanted to measure the effectiveness of the program based
on the population that it will be serving. To do this, we used a
convenience sample of adults who registered to take educational
programs with a charity that provides this (Little Warriors).
Recruitment
Study participants were recruited from people that enrolled to
take the program. While registering for the program, each person
was informed in general terms about the study, and asked if
he/she could be contacted with more information. Individuals
who agreed to find out more were provided with information and
the informed consent form. If they agreed to take part they were
then given a unique user number, and information about how
to use this to access the secure on-line site where information
was collected at baseline. The only required inclusion criteria,
other than agreeing to take part in the training session and study,
was that they were aged 18 or older. There were no additional
exclusion criteria for this study.
Program Implementation
There were a total of 23 program workshops, involving 366
participants, carried out during the final 3-months of 2014 in 14
communities in Western Canada. The individual who facilitated
the vast majority of groups had no previous expertise in this, and
no background in medicine or allied professions, to allow some
approximation toward the anticipated outcomes when given by
other similar individuals. Groups who participated in program
workshops included those offered to the general public (14),
child/youth serving organizations (5), community groups (2),
a mother’s group (1), and a group of individuals attending a
conference regarding youth issues (1).
Measurement of Effectiveness and Research Design
Participants were given pre-test (baseline) measurements to
assess attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors related to CSA during
the 7-days prior to the program workshop. Three months after
their participation in the program workshop they were asked
to complete follow-up questionnaires. Each participant’s post-
test results were compared to baseline results to assess the
amount of change that occurred. The main hypothesis being
tested was that, at 3-months post-training, participation in the
Prevent It! program would increase behaviors to reduce children’s
vulnerability to CSA.
Procedures
During the 7-days prior the program workshops, participants
completed baseline questionnaires via the secure online site.
Participants then took part in the 3-h program workshop. Three
months after completion of the program, study participants were
contacted and asked to complete the follow-up questionnaire
online. This process involved contact (via phone or email—at the
choice of the participant). A maximum of three attempts were
made for each individual who did not complete the follow-up
questionnaire.
Sample and Demographics
Participants were asked to self-report their gender, age, highest
education level completed, level of previous CSA training
received, and if they had experienced any type CSA themselves
during their childhood. Before being asked about their own
experience of sexual abuse, each participant was reminded of the
confidentiality of their responses and of the reason for collecting
the information. Participants were able to skip demographic
details if they chose.
The sample consisted of 312 adults who took the program and
completed the informed consent and pre-test questionnaire. Of
these, 209 individuals (67%) also completed the 3-month follow-
up questionnaire. However, of these a total of 12 questionnaires
were not usable due to incomplete identifying information,
while one individual with the same identifying information
completed the questionnaire twice and both versions were
therefore excluded. Thus the final study sample consisted of 195
individuals (63%) for whom there was study data, although some
individuals did not complete every section as specified below.
Demographic details for the 3 month follow-up group are shown
in Table 2.
It is important to note that we have baseline demographic
data on 312 individuals, but detailed follow-up data only 195
individuals. However, a Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed no
statistically significant demographic differences between these
groups.
Knowledge, Attitudes, and Behavioral Change
Previous studies demonstrate increased accurate knowledge and
positive attitudes after exposure to a CSA education program
(Hébert et al., 2002; Rheingold et al., 2007; Self-Brown et al., 2008;
and Bowman et al., 2010). Consequently, we measured these

constructs briefly. Knowledge was measured using three Likert
scale items. To measure attitudes we utilized three items from the
Child Abuse Myth Scale (Collings, 1997). Participants were asked
to indicate the extent to which they agreed with the statements
(Table 3) using Likert scale answers.
To
measure
behavioral
change
we
created
questions
based upon current best knowledge about how to decrease
children’s vulnerability to CSA (Martin and Silverstone, 2013).
We measured behaviors related to four major categories:
talking about CSA and healthy sexual development (HSD);
suspecting and reporting CSA; individual action strategies; and
organizational action strategies. We assessed participant’s use
of behavioral strategies by asking them to select the number of
times they had used the strategy in the previous 3-months as
well as to select all of the specific items they used from provided
checklists. Table 4 details the format, measurement, and coding
of each question.
Statistical Analysis
In order to assess change from pre-test to 3-month follow-up we
computed scores for several of the measures. To assess attitude
and knowledge change, each Likert scale response was scored
using the ideal responses with higher scores representing more
ideal responses. Each participant was given an attitude score and
a knowledge score at baseline and at pre-test with higher scores
representing more ideal responses. These scores were used to
determine attitude and knowledge change.
TABLE 3 | Measurement of knowledge and attitude.
Measure
Statementa
Knowledge
Children are most commonly sexually abused by people who are
known to the child and the child’s family.
When a child tells an adult he/she was sexually abused, it is
important for the adult to determine whether or not the abuse
happened.
If I suspect that a child is being sexually abused, I have a legal
obligation to report this abuse to child social services or police.
Attitude
Children who act in a seductive manner are not to blame if an adult
responds to them in a sexual way.
Sexual contact between an adult and a child that does not involve
actual or attempted sexual intercourse is unlikely to have serious
psychological consequences for the child.
Children who do not report ongoing sexual abuse must want the
sexual contact to continue.
aMeasured using a 5-point Likert scale: Strongly disagree (coded 4), disagree (coded 3),
not sure (coded 2), agree (coded 1), strongly agree (coded 0).
We assessed behavior change in several ways. First, the
measures for the number of times talking about CSA and
HSD, the number of times suspecting CSA, and the number
of times reporting CSA were compared directly between
baseline measurement and post-test measurement. Total scores
for CSA and HSD related topics, individual action strategies,
and organizational action strategies were computed by adding
together each strategy selected. We then computed an overall
behavior score for each participant at baseline and post-test by
summing the scores for CSA/HSD related topics talked about,
individual action strategies, and organizational action strategies
used to produce a single total score for each participant. Note that
for participants who selected not applicable for organizational
action strategies were excluded from the organizational strategies
analysis.
We used the Wilcoxon signed rank test to determine
within-subject statistically significant change from baseline
measurements to post-test measurements, given that the
Wilcoxon test is appropriate for use with non-parametric data
and related groups. Note that we did not apply a Bonferroni
correction for multiple comparisons since, while a Bonferroni
correction can be useful for reducing the risk of Type I errors
in multiple comparisons, it also creates a loss of power to detect
changes that are present making its usefulness disputed in studies
such as the current one (Keppel, 1991; Perneger, 1998; Divine
et al., 2013). Effect sizes were calculated using the standardized
z-score from the results of the Wilcoxon signed Rank test
divided by the square root of “n” (Field, 2009). Effect sizes were
understood using Cohen’s (1992) guidelines: r = 0.010 (small
effect), r = 0.30 (medium effect), r = 0.50 (large effect). Statistical
significance was defined as p < 0.05. Spearman’s correlation
was used to determine associations between demographic
variables and dependent variables. Missing values due to
lack of response to individual questions were excluded from
analysis.

RESULTS
Knowledge and Attitude
Measurements of knowledge and attitude had statistically
significantly increases from pre-test to 3-month follow-up
(Figure 1). A total of 174 study participants completed both
baseline and 3-month follow-up questionnaires in the knowledge
section of the questionnaire. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test
determined a highly statistically significant median increase in
knowledge score from pre-test (9) to 3-month follow-up (11),
Z = 7.463, p < 0.001 (Table 5). Of the 174 participants, 108
had higher scores. 44 had no change, and 22 had a decrease.
A total of 189 study participants completed both baseline and
3-month follow-up questionnaires in the attitude section of the
questionnaire. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test also showed a highly
statistically significant median increase in attitude score from
pre-test (10) to 3-month follow-up (12), Z = 4.724, p < 0.001
(Table 5). Of the 189 participants, 78 had increased scores, 86 had
no change, and 25 had a decrease in scores.
Behavioral Measures
All 195 study participants completed at least one section
of the behavioral questionnaire at both baseline and follow-
up, while a total of 117 study participants completed both
baseline and 3-month follow-up questionnaires on all sections of
the behavioral questionnaire (including organizational—which
didn’t apply to many individuals). Results of a Wilcoxon signed-
rank test found a highly statistically significant change between
the median at baseline and 3-month follow-up, Z = 5.322,
p < 0.001 (Figure 1). From the total number of 113 participants
77 scores increased, 7 scores did not change, and 29 scores
decreased.
Suspecting Child Sexual Abuse
A total of 186 study participants completed both baseline
and 3-month follow-up questionnaires in this section of the
behavioral questionnaire. Results of a Wilcoxon signed-rank
test found no statistically significant changes between the
median at baseline and 3-month follow-up (Table 6). After
the 3-month follow-up 22 participant’s scores in regards

Reporting Child Sexual Abuse
A total of 180 study participants completed both baseline
and 3-month follow-up questionnaires on this section of the
behavioral questionnaire. Results of a Wilcoxon signed-rank
test found no statistically significant changes between the
median at baseline and 3-month follow-up (Table 6). After

Number of Times Talking about Child Sexual Abuse
or Healthy Sexual Development
A total of 186 study participants completed both baseline and 3-
month follow-up questionnaires in this section of the behavioral
questionnaire. Results of a Wilcoxon signed-rank test found a
statistically significant change between the median at baseline
and 3-month follow-up (Table 6). From the total number of 186
participants 81 scores increased, 51 scored did not change, and
54 scores decreased.
Total Number of Topics Talked about
A total of 195 study participants completed both baseline and 3-
month follow-up questionnaires on this section of the behavioral
questionnaire. The median score at 3-month follow-up was
FIGURE 1 | Median score for attitude, knowledge, and behavior before
taking the workshop (baseline) and at 3-months after taking the
workshop (3-month follow-up). ***Results significant at p < 0.001.
higher than at pre-test. Results of a Wilcoxon signed-rank
test found a highly statistically significant change between the
median at baseline and 3-month follow-up (Table 6, Figure 2).
From the total number of 195 participants there were 101
increased scores, 31 did not change, and 63 had decreased
scores.
Total Individual Prevention Strategies Used
A total of 194 study participants completed both baseline
and 3-month follow-up questionnaires on this section of the
behavioral questionnaire. Median score at 3-month follow-up
was double that at pre-test (Figure 2). Results of a Wilcoxon
signed-rank test found a statistically significant change between
the median at baseline and 3-month follow-up (Table 6). Of
the 194 participants that completed these measures, 101 had
an increase in score, 49 scores did not change, and 44 scores
decreased.
The individual action strategies are shown in Figure 3 with
each category being measured using the percentage of the sample
that used each strategy both at baseline and at 3-month follow-
up (Table 7). Results of a Wilcoxon signed-rank test found a
statistically significant change for watching for signs of abuse
between the median at baseline and 3-month follow-up (Table 6).
Of the 194 participants that completed these measures, 72
had an increase in score, 105 scores did not change, and 17
scores decreased. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test also found
statistically significant change for taking steps to protect children
from baseline to 3-month follow-up. Of the 194 participants
that completed these measures, 74 had an increase in score,
85 scores did not change, and 35 scores decreased. Statically
significant change from pre-test to 3-months follow-up also
occurred in being a responsible role model for other adult.
Of the 194 participants that completed these measures, 74 had
an increase in score, 85 scores did not change, and 35 scores
decreased.
Total Organizational Prevention Strategies Used
A total of 124 study participants completed both baseline
and 3-month follow-up questionnaires on this section of the
behavioral questionnaire, with the rest stating this section of
the questionnaire was not relevant to their role. Median scores
at 3-month follow-up were three times higher than at pre-test
(Figure 2). Results of a Wilcoxon signed-rank test found a highly
statistically significant change between the median at baseline
and 3-month follow-up (Table 6). Of these 124 individuals
involved with organizations 79 had an increase in score, 9 scores
did not change, and 37 scores decreased.

Descriptive Statistics and Behavioral
Change Measures
Behavioral measures were also separated into individual variable
categories and looked at using percentages of the total sample
(Table 7) in order to gain more insight into changes that occurred
in the 3 months after taking the program. We ran statistical
analysis on the variables included within individual action
strategies (Table 6) because these variables were of particular
interest. We did not run analysis to determine the statistical
significance the remainder of these categories because of the high
number of variables and associated increasing risk of Type I
errors as more tests are run.

individual action strategies used, total organizational strategies
used, number of times suspecting CSA, or number of times
reporting CSA. However, we found no statistically significant
correlations between these variables and gender, age, highest
level of education completed, or self-reported sexual abuse as a
child other than a single negative relationship between having
previous CSA training and change in use or organizational action
strategies. There was a significant negative relationship between
having previous CSA training and change in use or organizational
action strategies, rs = −0.278, p = 0.002.
Effect Sizes
Medium effect sizes were seen for individual and organizational
behavior change and small effect sizes for measures related to
talking with children about CSA and HSD (Table 6). Effect size
for knowledge change was large (0.57) and medium for attitude
(0.34) (Table 5).
DISCUSSION
The Prevent It! program workshops described in this study are
a novel approach to create a program that can potentially help,
or even reduce, the large numbers of individuals who experience
CSA. This program was developed in a comprehensive manner
and is unique compared to previous approaches. The goal was
to develop an evidence-based program that can be administered
by community volunteers adults involved with children, which
will increase their knowledge and attitudes toward CSA. Perhaps
even more importantly, the primarily outcome goal was that
the Prevent It! program would improve the actual behaviors
of the adults taking part. The results from the present study
strongly support these intentions. The results clearly show that
this program significantly improves knowledge, attitudes, and
behaviors in adults that take the program.
Interestingly, while we found many changes overall, for the
two items, “Suspecting CSA” and “Reporting CSA,” there were

Sexual Abuse Prevention for Adults
no statistically significant changes. However, we believe the likely
reason for this lack of change was that 3-months was not enough
time for individuals to be in situations where they may have come
across CSA. To answer such a question, a 12-month follow-up
may help determine if the Prevent It! program changes these
behaviors over the longer-term, and we anticipate such longer-
term research in the future.
Our findings contribute to a small and growing field
of research regarding adult-targeted CSA prevention. Results
support previous studies that have found classroom-based
teaching of adults about CSA can improve knowledge, attitudes,
and behavioral intentions. However, one drawback of classroom-
based training is the cost involved, and therefore internet based
approaches are now starting to be considered because they
are more cost-effective and can increase accessibility (Wurtele,
2009). It is uncertain about differential effectiveness of in-person
training with a facilitator (Paranal et al., 2012; Rheingold et al.,
2012) although results from one novel study suggest that an
online version can be as effective as a classroom version for
childcare professionals (Rheingold et al., 2015). Ideal future
research will involve comparisons with an internet-based version
of Prevent It! to assess if this is true for general public adults as
well. For these reasons, we are developing this, and plan to study
its effectiveness in future research. Additionally, although the
program is designed to be facilitated by community volunteers,
the present study utilized experienced staff, and therefore further
research should compare the outcomes when such volunteers are
facilitators.
Nonetheless, despite the positive findings from the present
study, there are some methodological matters that should be
considered as potential limitations. Firstly, we utilized a within-
subject design comparing baseline to 3-month follow-up, with
studies suggesting that attitudes and behavioral intentions are
persistent over time (Deblinger et al., 2010). Nonetheless, for
further certainty that all these positive findings were due to the
program and not other factors, a randomized wait-list control
study could be carried out. Secondly, our study population
only consisted of 63% of those who took the program and
completed baseline demographic data. However, there were
no statistically significant differences in demographics between
those who completed follow-up and those who did not, and we
therefore believe that the results reflect the wider group, not just
the responders. Thirdly, only a small number of men (n = 22)
took part in the program, and therefore the impact of this
program on men is less certain. This is a problem that is common
in studies in this area (i.e., Rheingold et al., 2012, 2015), and it has
also been suggested that there may be less support regarding the
issue of CSA in some male-dominated organizations (Parent and
Demers, 2009). It is possible that subsequent focus group research
involving men may help address this issue. Fourthly, next steps
in this field of research are to address challenges associated
with the limitations of the measurement tools used. Cronbach’s
alpha may be a useful measure of internal consistency moving
forward and some assessment of reliability and validity of the
measurement tools will the generalizability of results in this study
and others. Also, because self-report measures of behaviors were
used, results may be biased by social desirability. The anonymous
online questionnaire format of the measures may help to reduce
the impact of social desirability in this study.
In conclusion, the purpose of this study was to determine the
effectiveness of a CSA prevention program. Previous research
has demonstrated the ability of programs such as this to
change knowledge and increase participant’s likelihood of using
preventative behaviors. This is the first study to measure
general public adult’s self-reported use of preventative behaviors.
Compared to baseline, at the 3-month follow up, participants
who took the program were talking about CSA and healthy
sexual development twice as much, were using twice as many
individual action strategies, and were utilizing three times as
many organizational strategies. Knowledge and positive attitude
also increased significantly. The results suggest that the Prevent
It! program is highly effective, and strongly support it’s more
widespread use.
