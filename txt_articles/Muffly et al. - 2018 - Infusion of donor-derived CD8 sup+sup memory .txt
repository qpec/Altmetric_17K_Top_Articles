Key Points
• Phenotypic TM isolation
from unmanipulated
donor apheresis via
CD45RA depletion
followed by CD81
enrichment is feasible.
• TM infusion for patients
with relapse after
allogeneic HCT was
safe and resulted in
minimal GVHD.
Murine models showed that CD81CD44hi memory T (TM) cells could eradicate malignant cells
without inducing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). We evaluated the feasibility and safety
of infusing freshly isolated and purified donor-derived phenotypic CD81 TM cells into
adults with disease relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).
Phenotypic CD8 TM cells were isolated after unmobilized donor apheresis using a tandem
immunomagnetic selection strategy of CD45RA depletion followed by CD81 enrichment.
Fifteen patients received CD81 TM cells at escalating doses (1 3 106, 5 3 106, or 10 3 106 cells
per kg). Thirteen received cytoreduction before CD81 TM cell infusion, and 9 had active
disease at the time of infusion. Mean yield and purity of the CD81 TM infusion were 38.1%
and 92.8%, respectively; .90% had CD81 T effector memory phenotype, cytokine
expression, and secretion profile. No adverse infusional events or dose-limiting toxicities
occurred; GVHD developed in 1 patient (grade 2 liver). Ten patients (67%) maintained or
achieved response (7 complete response, 1 partial response, 2 stable disease) for at least
3 months after infusion; 4 of the responders had active disease at the time of infusion. With a
median follow-up from infusion of 328 days (range, 118-1328 days), median event-free
survival and overall survival were 4.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 1-19.3 months)
and 19.6 months (95% CI, 5.6 months to not reached), respectively. Collection and
enrichment of phenotypic CD81 TM cells is feasible, well tolerated, and associated with a low
incidence of GVHD when administered as a manipulated infusion of donor lymphocytes
in patients who have relapsed after HCT. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov
as #NCT01523223.
Introduction
Disease relapse remains the primary cause of failure after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation
(allo-HCT) for malignant diseases.1,2 Management options for post-HCT relapse include cessation of
immunosuppressive medications, salvage therapy, second HCT, or donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI).
Despite these conventional interventions, few patients achieve durable complete remission (CR), and
survival after disease relapse remains poor, with less than 25% of patients alive at 2 years.3-8
The success of DLI to treat disease relapse after allo-HCT requires that the infused donor lymphocytes
induce a clinically significant immune-mediated graft-versus-tumor (GVT) response without eliciting
severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Aside from chronic myeloid leukemia, the disease in which

 DLI proved most effective at inducing durable remissions,9,10
treatment of posttransplant relapse with DLI in other hematologic
malignancies has been less effective.8,11,12
Dose-finding studies that used unmanipulated DLI showed that doses
#1 3 107 CD31 cells per kg resulted in reduced GVHD incidence but
with minimal tumor response, and higher doses led to improved
disease control but with the risk of severe GVHD.13 Manipulation of
T-cell composition before DLI infusion (eg, total CD81 T-cell depletion
or enrichment of total CD41 T cells) did not significantly influence
GVHD risk or relapse.14,15
Studies from several groups that used murine models of bone marrow
transplantation (BMT) demonstrated that phenotypic memory T (TM)
cells, including CD41 and CD81 TM cells, induced significantly less
GVHD than naive T (TN) cells (CD62LhiCD44lo) or combinations of
TN and TM cells.16-21 Our group reported the CD81CD44hi T-cell
subset containing both central memory (TCM) and effector memory
(TEM) cells mediated potent graft-versus-leukemia activity because total
T cells had not yet induced severe GVHD.22 In these models, which
included major histocompatibility–matched and –mismatched strain
combinations, we showed that a highly enriched population of CD81
CD44hi TM cells can be used as therapeutic DLI in mice that have
progressive lymphoma after BMT. In contrast, total TN cells, sorted
CD41 and CD81 TN cells, CD41 TM cells, and total TM cells either
induced lethal GVHD or lacked potent antitumor activity.
We sought to translate the murine model to human transplantation and
evaluated the feasibility and safety of infusing a freshly isolated and
purified population of phenotypic CD81 TM cells instead of an
unmanipulated DLI into allo-HCT recipients who had relapsed after
transplant. First, and as a prelude to the clinical trial, we used peripheral
blood mononuclear cells from unstimulated apheresis collections and
developed a tandem immunomagnetic selection strategy using iron-
dextran beads conjugated to CD45RA to deplete naive cells followed
by CD8 enrichment. In additional studies, we more fully characterized
the phenotypic CD81 TM cells and tested for immune reactivity in vitro
by stimulation with irradiated allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear
cells from normal donors. The responder CD81 TM cells showed little
increase in 3H-thymidine incorporation in cultures with allogeneic
stimulator cells, and the supernatants showed a marked increase in the
concentration of interferon-g (IFN-g) and tumor necrosis factor-a
(TNF-a) and a minimal increase in the concentration of interleukin-2
(IL-2). The results of the human mixed leukocyte response (MLR)
experiments were consistent with the responses observed with
CD81 TM cells from mice in which the murine responder cells also
showed little increase in 3H-thymidine incorporation after stimulation
with allogeneic cells; IFN-g production was considerably greater than
IL-2 production.21 We then completed a phase 1 feasibility and safety
study in which escalating doses of phenotypic CD81 TM cells derived
from the recipient’s original HLA-matched sibling donor were
administered to 15 patients who had relapse of their hematologic
malignancy after allo-HCT. The infusion of a purified population of
phenotypic CD81 TM cells was safe and did not induce GVHD.
Efficacy was difficult to assess given the nature of the phase 1 safety
and feasibility study, but durable CRs were observed in some patients.
Methods
Graft engineering: CD81 TM selection
Phenotypic CD81 TM cells (CD81CD45RA–) were isolated
from the original HLA-matched transplant donor after two 12-L
unstimulated apheresis collections. The CD45RA– cells were
obtained by labeling peripheral blood collections with research-
grade CliniMACS CD45RA Microbeads (catalog No. 130-020-
003) and Reagent (Miltenyi Biotec) followed by selection on the
CliniMACS Plus Instrument using the Depletion 3.2 program with
CliniMACS Depletion tubing sets. The flow-through CD45RA– cells
were labeled with research-grade CliniMACS CD8 Microbeads
(catalog No. 130-030-810) and Reagent and were selected by
using the Enrichment 3.1 program with standard CliniMACS tubing
sets. Postselection products were washed and resuspended in
100 mL of Normosol-R with 1% human serum albumin for 24 to
48 hours of storage at 4°C before infusion. No products were
cryopreserved. Cell recovery and purity were determined by flow
cytometric analysis. Release criteria included CD81 TM cell
products with .90% cell viability with no evidence of infection,
and $80% of cells expressed CD8 memory phenotype (CD81
CD45RA–CD45RO1) with #5% of cells expressing the CD31
CD45RA1CD45RO– phenotype (LSR and FACS Vantage cytom-
eters, Becton Dickinson). All products were infused within 48 hours
after completing the last apheresis collection.
Antibodies and flow cytometric analysis
Flow cytometric analysis of cell subsets was performed at each
selection step. Apheresis blood collections were sampled before
selection and after CD45RA depletion and CD8 enrichment steps
and were evaluated for expression of CD45, CD4, CD8, CD45RA,
and CD45RO. Flow cytometric analysis was performed for CD81
CD45RA1selected cells, which were then evaluated for expression
of CD45, CD4, CD8, CD44, CCR7, and CD62L. Reagents were
obtained from BD Biosciences. Four single apheresis products
from normal human donors were obtained before proceeding with
the phase 1 clinical trial. Data were acquired on Influx cytometers
and analyzed by using FlowJo software.
Cytokine expression, mixed lymphocyte reaction, and
cytokine secretion
Cytokine expression of the T-cell subsets was evaluated according
to BD Bioscience’s protocol, and as previously described.23 In brief,
sorted T-cell populations were stimulated with ionomycin and
phorbol myristate acetate for 6 hours and treated with Brefeldin A
(Sigma-Aldrich) added after 2 hours. The cells were fixed, and
membranes were permeabilized with a saponin-based reagent
(Cytofix-Cytoperm Kit, BD Biosciences) and stained for intracellular
cytokines with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) anti-IL-2 monoclo-
nal antibody (mAb), FITC anti-IFN-g mAb, and FITC anti-TNF-a mAb
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The gated cells were
analyzed for the percentage that were positive on staining for each
cytokine.
Total CD41 cells and the enriched CD81 TM cell subset from
healthy donors were used as responder cells and mixed with
irradiated (5000 cGy) stimulator cells made from a pool of
mononuclear cells obtained from 3 normal participants with MLR.
The incorporation of 3H-thymidine during the last 24 hours of
culture was measured after 7 days of incubation, and cytokine
secretion in the supernatants was analyzed in a multiplex assay
system with microsphere beads after the 7-day culture.24 Cytokine
secretion for IL-2, TNF-a, and IFN-g was assessed by Cytometric
Bead Array (Becton Dickinson) according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines.

From 
 Clinical trial eligibility
Eligible patients were age 18 to 75 years and had a hematologic
malignancy that had relapsed after allo-HCT from an HLA-matched
sibling donor. Treatment for disease relapse was allowed before
CD81 TM cell infusion but was not mandatory. Patients were
required to have no active GVHD and to be receiving a stable dose
of immunosuppressants or taking no immunosuppressants for
4 weeks before CD81 TM cell infusion. Patients with active infection
or inadequate organ function (liver function tests $4 times the
upper limit of normal or a serum creatinine .2.5 mg/dL) were
excluded. All patients provided written informed consent to
participate in this study, which was approved by the Stanford
University Institutional Review.
Study design
This single-institution, open-label, phase 1 clinical trial evaluated the
feasibility, safety, and maximum-tolerated dose of allogeneic CD81
TM cell infusion derived from HLA-matched sibling donors. The
study design followed a standard 313 dose escalation, with
patients enrolled at escalating dose levels of 1 3 106, 5 3 106, and
10 3 106 cells per kg. Dosing was chosen on the basis of results from
the CD81CD45RA– cell recovery obtained during the development of
the CD81 TM cell selection strategy. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs)
were defined as grade 3 to 4 toxicity according to Common Toxicity
Criteria v.4. Dose escalation required no DLTs for all 3 patients in a
dose level cohort. An expanded 6-patient cohort was enrolled at the
maximum-tolerated dose. Cells were infused fresh; premedication was
not used. Patients were monitored every 30 minutes for a minimum of
2 hours after the infusion.
Study assessments
Toxicity evaluations were performed every 14 days for the first
month and then every 28 days for a minimum of 6 months after cell
infusion. Repeat disease evaluations were performed at 3 and
6 months after CD81 TM cell infusion.
Results
CD81 TM cell selection strategy
Experiments using 4 single apheresis products from normal human
donors revealed that CD81CD45RA– TM cells comprised approx-
imately 3% (range, 1%-4%) of total nucleated cells or 6% of total
CD31 cells per apheresis collection (data not shown). Accordingly,
we used the anti-CD45RA antibody-conjugated beads for negative
selection to deplete naive cells. Thereafter, the flow-through
CD45RA– cells were incubated with Miltenyi anti-CD8 antibody-
conjugated beads to positively select the CD81 cells. The
postenrichment CD45RA–CD81 T cells had high purity (.95%;
Figure 1). After tandem selection, mean cell yield was 2.6 3 108
(range, 1.3-4.9 3 108) CD45RA–CD81 T cells from a single

 apheresis product. We calculated that after 2 consecutive 12-L
aphereses per donor, the highest feasible dose of CD81 TM cells
available for infusion would be 10 3 108 cells, assuming most
recipients weighed ,100 kg, and attainable numbers of CD81 TM
cells for the phase 1 dose-escalation trial were 1 3 106, 5 3 106,
and 10 3 106 cells per kg.
Flow cytometric analysis, cytokine expression, MLR,
and cytokine secretion
In additional studies that used unstimulated products from 6 healthy
human donors, we evaluated the composition and compartmental-
ization of TM CD41 and CD81 naive and TM cell subsets before
selection, after CD45RA depletion, and after CD81 enrichment
(Figure 2A). In preselection apheresis samples, na¨
ıve and TCM cells
were the dominant cell types and were in similar proportions among
CD41 gated T cells (Figure 2A), whereas TEM cells represented a
minority of the cell composition. In contrast to the composition
among CD41 gated cells, TCM cells existed at very low frequencies
(range, ,1.0%-3.0%) in donor preselection samples among CD81
gated T cells. Instead, TEM cells were dominant and ranged from
79.5% to 92.5% of CD45RO1 cells in CD81 gated preselection
samples. Thus, among CD81 gated CD45RO1 total memory cells,
the TEM:TCM ratio in preselection samples ranged from 3.9:1 to as
high as 28.5:1. These results are in keeping with reports from others
that showed TEM cells greatly outnumber TCM cell in CD81 gated
healthy donor blood samples.24,25 For a given individual and among
CD81 gated cells, the TEM:TCM ratio did not change with each step
of cell processing: the ratio of CD81 gated TEM:TCM cells in the
preselection sample was maintained after CD45RA depletion and
after CD81 cell selection (Figure 2A). Flow cytometric analyses
of the final CD45RA–CD81-enriched cells were most consistent
with phenotypic CD81 TEM (CD45RO1CD441CD62L–) cells
(Figure 2A).
But a rigid subclassification of CD81 TM cells based on expression
of CD62L and CCR7 alone is unlikely to be all inclusive, because
phenotypic heterogeneity within the CD81 TM cell pool has been
observed.25 The subclassification of CD81 TM cell subsets is
supported by characteristics of an immune response. In MLR,
CD81 TEM cells showed low-level proliferation in response to third-
party stimulators and produced high levels of IFN-g with little IL-2
compared with CD81 TCM cells that proliferate and secrete IL-2 and
IFN-g.26 Consequently, we evaluated the cytokine expression in
sorted phenotypic CD45RA–CD81 TM cells upon activation by
ionomycin and phorbol myristate acetate and observed high levels
of IFN-g and little detectable IL-2, whereas sorted CD45RA1CD81
and CD45RA–CD41 T cells expressed both IL-2 and IFN-g
Figure 2. (continued) CD45RA–CD81-enriched cells is consistent with the phenotypic CD81 TEM subset being predominantly CD45RA–CD45RO1CD62L–. The TEM cells
ranged from 81.7% to 98.1% of the final cell composition. (B) Flow cytometric analysis of cytokine expression by enriched cell subsets. Cells were activated by ionomycin and
phorbol myristate acetate, treated with monensin, and stained for expression of CD45, CD4, CD8, and CD45RA. Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained for INF-g, and IL-2.
Plots show comparison of IL-2 and IFN-g expression in CD81CD45RA–, CD81CD45RA1, and CD41CD45RA– cells as indicated. (C) Proliferation of CD81CD45R– and CD41

From 
 (Figure 2B). In other studies, the sorted CD45RA–CD81 T cells
showed minimal proliferation in response to irradiated third-party
allogeneic stimulators obtained from a pool of normal donors in
MLR compared with the proliferation of CD41 cells (Figure 2C).
The supernatants from the CD45RA–CD81 T-cell populations
expressed high levels of IFN-g and TNF-a but little detectable IL-2,
consistent with the effector memory classification (Figure 2D). The
results of these experiments were consistent with human CD81
TEM responses and the responses observed with CD81 TM cells
from mice that had little increase in 3H-thymidine incorporation after
stimulation with allogeneic cells, and the production of IFN-g was
considerably greater than production of IL-2.22,26
Patient characteristics
Fifteen patients with disease relapse after allo-HCT received
phenotypic CD81 TM cell infusion at 3 escalating dose levels
(Table 1). The median time from allo-HCT to disease relapse was
508 days (range, 59-3214 days), and the median time from disease
relapse to CD81 TM cell infusion was 236 days (range, 7-3005
days). Thirteen patients (87%) received cytoreductive therapy
before phenotypic CD81 TM cell infusion. At the time of the CD81
TM cell infusion, 6 patients (40%) were in CR, and the remaining 9
patients (60%) had active disease. No patients were receiving
ongoing immunosuppressive therapy at the time of cell infusion.
Clinical responses
Responses after CD81 TM cell infusion are detailed in Table 2.
Median follow-up for all patients from the time of CD81 TM cell
infusion was 328 days (range, 118-1328 days). Ten patients (67%)
maintained or achieved response (7 CR, 1 partial response, 2 stable
disease) for at least 3 months after CD81 TM cell infusion; 4 of the
responders had active disease at the time of infusion. Five patients
(33%) had no response to CD81 TM cell infusion; all 5 of these
patients had active disease at the time of infusion. Among the 10
responders, 7 subsequently relapsed with a median time to relapse
of 165 days (range, 90-973 days). Eight patients are currently alive;
3 are alive in CR and 5 are alive with disease. For the entire study

 enrichment step in all patients. The mean CD81 TM cell purity of the
infused product was 85.7%, 97.5%, and 93.1%, for dose levels 1,
2, and 3, respectively. All patients in dose levels 1 and 2 received
the intended CD81 TM cell doses. Five of the patients treated at
dose level 3 received the planned 10 3 106 cells per kg CD81 TM
cell dose, whereas the dose could not be obtained for 4 patients
who received 7.8 3 106, 8.0 3 106, 5.2 3 106, and 7.7 3 106 cells
per kg.
Safety, GVHD, and adverse events
CD81 TM cell infusions were well tolerated. One patient developed
asymptomatic grade 2 GVHD of the liver after a CD81 TM cell dose
of 10 3 106 cells per kg. There were no infusion-related toxicities or
DLTs attributed to the CD81 TM cells in any patient.
Discussion
The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility
and safety of using donor-derived phenotypic CD81 TM cells to
treat disease relapse after allo-HCT. We developed a novel 2-step
clinically compliant procedure that used unstimulated donor
apheresis collections and depleted CD45RA1 cells followed
by CD81 cell selection to provide an enriched population of
phenotypic CD81 TEM cells and conducted a first-in-human 15-
patient clinical trial.
The rationale for depleting CD45RA1 TN cells stemmed from
murine
models
of
BMT
that
consistently
showed
that
TM
cells (including CD41 and/or CD81 TM cells) induced significantly
less GVHD than TN cells (CD62LhiCD44lo) from unprimed
donors.16-19,27,28 Additional studies by our group showed that
CD81 TM cells, but not CD41 TM cells, mediated potent antitumor
reactions.22 In these models, the infusion of CD44hiCD81 TM cells
after major histocompatibility–matched and –mismatched trans-
plantation eradicated BCL1 lymphoma, even after progressive
tumor growth, just as well as an unmanipulated DLI but did not
induce GVHD. Thus, TN depletion followed by CD81 selection
would best recapitulate the murine model and perhaps might also
translate into an adoptive immunotherapy cell product that will
maintain GVT reactions but not induce significant graft-versus-host
(GVH) reactions.
The low incidence of GVHD in this trial paralleled the low incidence
of GVHD seen in preclinical models. Only 1 patient developed
postinfusion acute GVHD that was treated to resolution with
corticosteroids. It is worth noting that a majority of patients included
in this phase 1 trial had relapsed .1 year after HCT; late relapses
have also shown an association with reduced risk of GVHD after
DLI.29 The CD81 TM DLI was otherwise well tolerated and safe, and
no patient developed chronic GVHD. The impact of CD81 TM cell
infusions on donor chimerism was not assessable because nearly
all patients had complete donor chimerism at the time of the
infusion.
In
comparison,
an
unmanipulated
DLI
can
invoke
significant toxicity and GVHD-related mortality.11
It is not possible to draw conclusions regarding efficacy, given the
intrinsic nature of a phase 1, 313 dose-escalation safety and
feasibility trial design and heterogeneous study population. The
CD81 TM DLI had little or no impact on the 9 patients who had
refractory disease, and these patients subsequently died of
progressive disease. For the 6 patients whose disease returned
to CR before the CD81 TM cell infusion, 2 remain alive and in CR at
last follow-up, and 4 had subsequent disease relapse. These
observations are not unlike those from an experience using an
unmanipulated DLI to treat relapse for diseases other than chronic
myeloid leukemia, but the difference seems to be the lack of toxicity
with CD81 TM DLI.7,8,11,12
The processing method for CD81 TM cell selection required 1 day
in a routine hematopoietic stem cell laboratory and used clinical-
grade immunomagnetic kits. The cell selection method was easier
to use than alternative procedures currently being investigated that
selectively deplete alloreactive T cells using immunotoxins or in vitro
photodynamic purging.30,31 The purity of the final infusate in this trial
was high, with a median value of .94.6% of cells expressing a
CD81 TM phenotype, of which the overwhelming majority were
CD81 TEM cells.32 A small percentage were CD81 TCM cells, and
even fewer were CD81 natural killer cells and CD141CD81
monocytes. The main limitation of the selection procedure was

From 
 the maximum dose of CD81 TM cells that could be obtained. Even
with batching 2 consecutive 12-L apheresis collections from each
donor, we were unable to achieve the desired target dose (10 3 106
cells per kg) for all patients in cohort 3. Instead, we determined that a
reliable dose for trial design using the current cell processing
methods is 5 3 106 CD81 TM cells per kg. The limitation in cell
numbers arose because the CD81 TM cell yield averaged about
40% of the starting number of cells. The majority of the cell loss
occurred with CD81 selection and not during CD45RA depletion.
We posit that the CliniMACS CD8 Microbeads and Reagent Kit
may be better suited for CD81 depletion than for enrichment.
Nonetheless, to achieve a dose of 5 3 106 CD81 TM cells per kg,
an unmanipulated DLI of at least 100 3 106 CD31 cells per kg
would be required because CD81 TEM cells represent, on average,
,5% of the nucleated cells in an unstimulated apheresis product.
An unmanipulated DLI at this high dose has been associated with a
substantial risk of precipitating severe acute GVHD.9,10,12,13,33
Therefore, in this trial, patients were infused with a dose of CD81
TEM cells that would otherwise be untenable if an unmanipulated
DLI were used.
Other groups previously performed clinical trials using TN-depleted
products, but the cell harvesting method involved mobilization with
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and the processing methods
did not include CD81 selection; consequently, the final cell product
shared few similarities with the cell product in this trial. Bleakley
et al34 reported the outcomes of acute leukemia patients trans-
planted with TN-depleted stem cell grafts from HLA-matched
donors. Donors received granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for
stem cell mobilization, and apheresis products were processed by
using a 2-step immunomagnetic selection procedure that involved
positive selection of CD341 progenitor cells followed by depletion
of CD45RA1 cells from the CD34– fraction. The final infusate
consisted of the enriched CD341 cells combined with the
CD45RA-depleted product adjusted to infuse 10 3 106 CD31
CD45RA– T cells per kg. Analysis showed that among the CD31
CD45RA– T cells, the vast majority (80%) were CD41 TM
phenotype (CD31CD41CD45RA–CD45RO1) of which almost
70% were CCR71CD271CD281, consistent with phenotypic
TCM cells. The processing strategy relied on CD45RA depletion
without positive selection; therefore, there was significant contam-
ination of the final product with CD45RA– non–T cells. Acute
grade 2 to 3 GVHD was observed in 23 of 35 recipients. It is
possible that the cellular composition that included a high number
of CD141 monocytes and CD41 TCM cells provided sufficient
helper function to induce GVH reactions. In another study, 5
pediatric severe combined immunodeficiency patients received
unstimulated BM grafts from 1-allele mismatched related or
unrelated donors.35 The harvested BM was processed in a 2-step
procedure that also involved CD341 selection followed by
CD45RA1 depletion of the CD34– flow-through fraction. The
median dose of CD31CD45RA– T cells infused was low (2.5 3 106
cells per kg), and .80% of the CD31CD45RA– T cells were
phenotypic CD41 TCM cells. One of 5 patients developed clinically
significant acute GVHD. In contrast to those 2 studies, in this trial,
the final infused product was almost entirely composed of
phenotypic CD81 TEM cells. In murine models, TEM cells did not
cause GVHD, whereas TCM cells did cause GVHD, albeit somewhat
less severe than that caused by TN cells.20
It is unclear why phenotypic CD81 TM cells from unprimed donors
would possess antitumor activity. The ability of CD81 TM cells to
eradicate tumor may in part be dependent on their alloreactivity to
host histocompatibility tissue antigens, because C57BL/6 CD81
T cells tolerized to BALB/c alloantigens lose their graft antitumor
activity against BCL1 lymphoma.36 Antitumor alloreactivity of
CD81 TM cells may also be explained by molecular mimicry and
cross-reactivity with viral antigens in the environment that were
shown to enhance immune responses to alloantigens on organ
transplants.37-39 Alternatively, naive CD81 T cells can masquerade
as memory phenotype cells after homeostatic expansion and
can maintain the naive T-cell tissue cross-reactivity repertoire.40
Consistent with retained antitumor activity, the CD81 TM cells
produced high levels of IFN-g, a cytokine frequently required in
models of antitumor activity.41
The main limitations to successful transplant outcomes are disease
relapse, GVHD, and infections, and composite indexes such as
GVHD–relapse free survival suggest that ;25% of all recipients
have uncomplicated posttransplant courses.42 Thus, there are
compelling reasons to seek alternates to giving unmanipulated
donor allografts. Within the limitations of this single-arm safety and
feasibility trial, we developed a rapid and relatively easy cell
processing method that provided a highly enriched population of
CD81 TEM cells. The cells were safe, did not induce significant
GVHD, and may have a clinical signal of efficacy because durable
remissions were observed in one-third of the recipients who
returned to CR prior to the cell infusion. It is possible that
lymphodepletion before the CD81 TM cell infusion may potentiate
efficacy without aggravating GVHD, and this approach is being
evaluated in current and future planned studies of CD81 TM cells.
Alternatively, combining CD81 TM cells with CD341 selected grafts
at the time of transplantation may be a reasonable consideration,
and efficacy could potentially be further enhanced with additional
strategies including checkpoint blockade. The generation of virus-
specific and tumor-specific T-cell clones by immunizing donors with
peptides before CD81 TM cell collection may enhance protection
from infection and relapse. We previously showed in a murine
model of BMT that donor immunization with WT-1 peptide and
adoptive transfer of CD81 T cells protected recipients from
posttransplant tumor challenge compared with CD81 T cells from
unimmunized donors.43 The results presented herein warrant
further exploration of CD81 TM cells with extension to other
transplantation settings.
