Abstract
IMPORTANCE—County-level patterns in mortality rates by cause have not been systematically 
described but are potentially useful for public health officials, clinicians, and researchers seeking 
to improve health and reduce geographic disparities.
OBJECTIVES—To demonstrate the use of a novel method for county-level estimation and to 
estimate annual mortality rates by US county for 21 mutually exclusive causes of death from 1980 
through 2014.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—Redistribution methods for garbage codes 
(implausible or insufficiently specific cause of death codes) and small area estimation methods 
(statistical methods for estimating rates in small subpopulations) were applied to death registration 
data from the National Vital Statistics System to estimate annual county-level mortality rates for 
21 causes of death. These estimates were raked (scaled along multiple dimensions) to ensure 
consistency between causes and with existing national-level estimates. Geographic patterns in the 
age-standardized mortality rates in 2014 and in the change in the age-standardized mortality rates 
between 1980 and 2014 for the 10 highest-burden causes were determined.
EXPOSURE—County of residence.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Cause-specific age-standardized mortality rates.
RESULTS—A total of 80 412 524 deaths were recorded from January 1, 1980, through 
December 31, 2014, in the United States. Of these, 19.4 million deaths were assigned garbage 
codes. Mortality rates were analyzed for 3110 counties or groups of counties. Large between-
county disparities were evident for every cause, with the gap in age-standardized mortality rates 
between counties in the 90th and 10th percentiles varying from 14.0 deaths per 100 000 population 
(cirrhosis and chronic liver diseases) to 147.0 deaths per 100 000 population (cardiovascular 
diseases). Geographic regions with elevated mortality rates differed among causes: for example, 
cardiovascular disease mortality tended to be highest along the southern half of the Mississippi 
River, while mortality rates from self-harm and interpersonal violence were elevated in 
southwestern counties, and mortality rates from chronic respiratory disease were highest in 
counties in eastern Kentucky and western West Virginia. Counties also varied widely in terms of 
the change in cause-specific mortality rates between 1980 and 2014. For most causes (eg, 
neoplasms, neurological disorders, and self-harm and interpersonal violence), both increases and 
decreases in county-level mortality rates were observed.

 CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—In this analysis of US cause-specific county-level 
mortality rates from 1980 through 2014, there were large between-county differences for every 
cause of death, although geographic patterns varied substantially by cause of death. The approach 
to county-level analyses with small area models used in this study has the potential to provide 
novel insights into US disease-specific mortality time trends and their differences across 
geographic regions.
Recent research has highlighted large, long-standing, and increasing geographic inequalities 
in life expectancy among counties within the United States.1,2 However, relatively little is 
known about geographic patterns and inequalities in mortality by underlying cause of death. 
Information about variation in cause-specific mortality could provide important insights into 
geographic inequalities and divergent trends in life expectancy. Moreover, local information 
about cause-specific mortality rates could be used by policy makers, clinicians, and public 
health professionals to inform more targeted strategies to improve health and survival and to 
decrease geographic inequalities in the United States.
Previous efforts3–8 to generate country-wide county-level estimates of cause-specific 
mortality have generally focused on only a single cause or group of closely related causes. 
The cause definitions used by these analyses vary widely (ie, the specific cause of death 
codes included for a given cause varies by analysis) as do the periods considered and the 
statistical methods used. Consequently, it is difficult to compare across causes that were 
analyzed separately. Furthermore, to our knowledge, no previous study of county-level 
cause-specific mortality has attempted to correct for the presence of garbage codes, that is, 
cause of death codes in death registration data that are implausible or insufficiently specific.9 
The proportion of registered deaths that are assigned garbage codes varies by county, year, 
and underlying true cause, and a failure to appropriately redistribute these deaths may lead 
to erroneous conclusions about geographic patterns, time trends, and the relative burden of 
different causes of death.
This study presents a novel method using garbage code redistribution methods (methods for 
reassigning garbage codes) and small area estimation methods (statistical methods for 
estimating rates among small subpopulations) for estimating county-level cause-specific 
mortality rates.
Methods
Data
This analysis used deidentified death records from the National Vital Statistics System 
provided by the National Center for Health Statistics.10 These records covered deaths that 
occurred within the United States from January 1, 1980, through December 31, 2014, and 
included the age, sex, and county of residence at the time of death for each decedent, as well 
as the registered underlying cause of death, coded according to the International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) for deaths prior to 1999 and ICD-10 for 
deaths that occurred in 1999 or later.11,12 Deaths were tabulated by age group (0, 1–4, 5–9, 
10–14, …, 75–79, and ≥80 years), sex, county, year, and cause. This research received

 institutional review board approval from the University of Washington. Informed consent 
was not required because the study used deidentified data and was retrospective.
Annual county-level population counts by age, sex, and race from 1980 to 1989 provided by 
the US Census Bureau and annual county-level population counts by age, sex, and race/
ethnicity from 1990 to 2014 provided by the National Center for Health Statistics were used 
in this analysis.13–16 Population counts in both series were summed across all race/ethnicity 
groups to generate annual county-level population counts by age group and sex. These 2 
sources were then combined to produce a time series covering 1980 through 2014 and scaled 
to match the total population in each year provided by the Human Mortality Database.17
County-level covariates on levels of education, income, race/ethnicity, Native American 
reservations, and population density were used in the small area estimation model. These 
covariates were based on data provided by the US Census Bureau and the National Center 
for Health Statistics. Covariates related to race and ethnicity were derived from self-reported 
responses to the decennial census and American Community Survey and use the categories 
specified by the Office of Management and Budget.18 More details on these data sources are 
provided in eTable 1 in the Supplement.
In a small number of cases, county boundaries shifted between 1980 and the present. To 
account for these changes, several counties were merged to create historically stable units. 
Details on the merged county units are provided in eTable 2 in the Supplement. For 
simplicity, these units are referred to as counties throughout.
Cause List and Garbage Code Redistribution
The cause list developed for the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD)19 was used for this 
analysis; it has been widely used for cause of death analyses.20,21 The GBD cause list is 
arranged hierarchically in 4 levels; within each level, the cause list is designed such that all 
deaths are assigned exactly 1 cause. As part of the GBD study, a map has been developed 
that allows ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes to be translated to GBD causes; eTable 3 in the 
Supplement lists all causes in the GBD cause list and the ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes that 
contributed to each cause. This analysis focuses on the 21 causes in the second level of this 
hierarchy (Box). This level was selected because major causes of death (eg, neoplasms, 
cardiovascular diseases) are distinguished but the number of causes is still relatively small, 
making it possible to consider all causes.
Previous studies9 have documented the high proportion of registered deaths for which the 
underlying cause of death has been assigned a garbage code, that is, a code that refers to an 
intermediate or immediate cause of death rather than an underlying cause of death (eg, 
cardiopulmonary arrest) or a code that is insufficiently specific (eg, malignant neoplasm of 
other and ill-defined sites). Failure to appropriately redistribute garbage codes can lead to 
erroneous geographic and temporal patterns (as the proportion of deaths with garbage codes 
varies over time and place) as well as incorrect relative rankings among causes (as the 
likelihood that a death is assigned a garbage code varies by true underlying cause).

 To address this issue, algorithms developed for the GBD study to redistribute deaths 
assigned garbage codes were used.19,21 First, specific garbage codes or groups of related 
garbage codes were assigned biologically plausible target causes. Second, deaths assigned 
garbage codes were redistributed to the target causes according to proportions derived in one 
of 4 ways: (1) published literature and/or expert opinion; (2) regression models linking 
changes in the proportion of deaths assigned to a given garbage code and those assigned to a 
given target code; (3) according to the proportions initially observed among the targets; and 
(4) for deaths with certain codes known to be related to human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV)/AIDS, the mortality rate in each 5-year period was compared with that in 1980 and 
deaths beyond a 5% increase were assigned to HIV/AIDS, while the remainder were 
assigned to a different biologically plausible target. More details on each of these methods 
are provided in the eAppendix in the Supplement.
As an example, 62 deaths among men in King County, Washington, were coded to 
unspecified heart disease in 2013. Based on the garbage code redistribution algorithms, 48 of 
these deaths were reassigned to ischemic heart disease, 3 to hypertensive heart disease, 2 to 
atrial fibrillation and flutter, 3 to cardiomyopathy and myocarditis, 1 to rheumatic heart 
disease, 1 to endocarditis, and 4 to other cardiovascular and circulatory diseases. eFigure 1 
in the Supplement depicts graphically how garbage code redistribution affects all 
cardiovascular diseases in King County. eFigure 2 and eFigure 3 in the Supplement show the 
percentage of deaths assigned garbage codes in each county and the effect of garbage code 
redistribution on total deaths by cause for the United States as a whole, respectively.
Mapping from ICD-9 and ICD-10 to the GBD cause list and redistribution of garbage codes 
were carried out at the lowest levels of the GBD cause hierarchy. Deaths were then 
aggregated to the first and second levels of the cause hierarchy.
Statistical Analysis
Bayesian spatially explicit mixed-effects regression models for all-cause mortality and each 
cause in level 1 and level 2 of the GBD cause hierarchy were estimated separately for males 
and females. The model included the following covariates: the proportion of the adult 
population who has graduated high school; the proportion of the population that is Hispanic; 
the proportion of the population that is black; the proportion of the population that is a race 
other than black or white; the proportion of a county that is contained within a state or 
federal Native American reservation; the median household income; and the population 
density. These covariates were chosen because they are well measured at the county level 
and expected to be predictive of county-level mortality rates. Further details about this 
model are provided in the eAppendix in the Supplement.
One thousand draws (ie, simulated values) of each model parameter were sampled from the 
posterior distribution and used to derive draws of the mortality rate for each county, year, 
and age group. To ensure internal consistency between estimates of all-cause mortality and 
cause-specific mortality as well as consistency with national-level estimates from the GBD 
study (which incorporate prevalence data for causes such as atrial fibrillation, as well as 
Alzheimer disease and other dementias, that cannot be used directly at the county level), the 
estimated mortality rates were raked (ie, scaled along multiple dimensions)22 such that the

 sum across all causes equaled the estimated all-cause mortality rate and that the population-
weighted average of the county-level mortality rates equaled the national-level mortality rate 
for each cause (further details are provided in the eAppendix in the Supplement). After 
raking, state- and national-level estimates of the age-specific mortality rates were derived by 
population weighting the county-level estimates, and estimates at the county, state, and 
national levels were age standardized using the US 2010 census population as the standard. 
Similarly, years of life lost (YLLs) were calculated for each age group by multiplying the 
mortality rate by population by life expectancy at the average age at death from the reference 
life table used in the GBD study19 and then summed across all ages (additional details are 
provided in the eAppendix in the Supplement).
Point estimates for each quantity of interest were derived from the mean of the draws, while 
95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) were derived from the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles. When 
measuring changes over time, the change was considered statistically significant if the 
posterior probability of an increase (or decrease) was at least 95%, ie, if the mortality rate 
increased (or declined) in at least 95% of the draws.
The performance of the small area models was evaluated using an established empirical 
validation framework designed specifically for the United States.23,24 This validation 
framework was used to compare performance of 4 variants of the model described earlier as 
well as 2 previously published models1,24 in terms of bias, precision, and coverage. The 
selected model consistently performed as well as or better than all other models. More 
details about the validation methods and results are included in the eAppendix in the 
Supplement.
Inequality among counties was quantified by comparing the mortality rate in the 90th 
percentile with the mortality rate in the 10th percentile among all counties in a given year. 
Two types of inequality were considered. Absolute inequality, which represents the absolute 
magnitude of the gap between high-and low-mortality counties, was quantified as the 
difference between the mortality rates in the 90th and 10th percentiles. Relative inequality, 
which represents the relative difference between high- and low-mortality counties, was 
quantified as the ratio of the mortality rate in the 90th percentile to the mortality rate in the 
10th percentile.
Garbage code redistribution was carried out in Python version 2.7.3 (Python Software 
Foundation) and Stata MP version 13.1 (StataCorp LP) statistical software. Small area 
estimation was carried out in R version 3.2.4 statistical software (R Foundation for 
Statistical Computing). Models were fit using the Template Model Builder Package in R.25
Results
A total of 80 412 524 deaths among US residents were recorded from January 1, 1980, 
through December 31, 2014. Of these, 19.4 million deaths were assigned garbage codes. 
Most of these deaths (17.8 million) were assigned codes referring to intermediate or 
unspecified causes presumably within the same ICD-9 or ICD-10 chapter as the true 
underlying cause (9.1 million in the cardiovascular diseases chapter; 2.9 million in the

 respiratory diseases chapter; 1.7 million in the cancer chapter; 1.1 million in the injuries 
chapter; 1.0 million in the infectious diseases chapter; and 1.9 million in other chapters), 
while the remaining 1.7 million deaths (2.1% of all deaths) were assigned ill-defined codes. 
Of the 19.4 million deaths assigned garbage codes, 19.1% were reassigned using published 
literature, 44.7% were reassigned using regression methods, 35.6% were reassigned using 
observed proportions among target codes, and 0.6% were reassigned to HIV/AIDS or other 
targets based on comparison with 1980. As a result of merging counties to address historical 
boundary changes, the number of areas analyzed was 3110 (compared with 3142).
The Table summarizes the results for all 21 causes of death in 2014 at the national and 
county levels. The first section summarizes the burden of each cause at the national level: for 
example, there were 846.3 thousand deaths and 11 735.8 thousand YLLs from 
cardiovascular diseases in 2014, with a mortality rate of 252.7 deaths per 100 000 
population. The second section summarizes the distribution of counties according to the age-
standardized mortality rate from each cause: for example, the lowest mortality rate from 
neoplasms was 70.7 deaths per 100 000 population, compared with 169.5, 204.3, and 246.3 
deaths per 100 000 population in counties in the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles, 
respectively, and 503.1 deaths per 100 000 population in the county with the highest rate. 
This corresponds to an absolute difference of 76.8 deaths per 100 000 population between 
the mortality rates in counties in the 90th and 10th percentiles.
The Figures in the article show the top 10 causes (in terms of YLLs) and eFigures 4–14 in 
the Supplement show the other 11 causes. Estimates for all causes and years are available in 
an online data visualization tool (Interactive).
Neoplasms
Neoplasms (Figure 1) caused 19 511 910 deaths (24.3% of all deaths) from 1980 through 
2014 and were the leading cause of YLLs and the second leading cause of deaths in 2014. 
The mortality rate from neoplasms varied widely among counties: counties in the 90th 
percentile experienced mortality rates 76.8 deaths per 100 000 population higher than those 
in the 10th percentile. Very high mortality rates were observed in counties along the 
southern half of the Mississippi River, in eastern Kentucky and western West Virginia, and 
in western Alaska. At the other extreme, many counties in states stretching from Idaho and 
Wyoming in the north to western Texas in the south had mortality rates from neoplasms 
much lower than average. The mortality rate from neoplasms declined by 20.1% (95% UI, 
18.2%–21.4%) overall between 1980 and 2014, but the mortality rate increased during the 
same period in 18.5% of counties (statistically significant in 5.1% of counties). Increases in 
mortality from neoplasms were found primarily in south-central counties, with the largest 
increases observed in eastern Kentucky. In contrast, the largest decreases in mortality from 
neoplasms were found primarily in counties in central Colorado, southern Florida, Alaska, 
parts of New England, and coastal counties in California.
Cardiovascular Diseases
Cardiovascular diseases (Figure 2) caused 31 992 547 deaths (39.8%) from 1980 through 
2014 and were the second leading cause of YLLs and the leading cause of deaths in 2014.

 Cardiovascular diseases were an important contributor to mortality in every county: in 2014, 
cardiovascular diseases were the leading cause of death in 97.1% of counties and the top-
ranked cause in terms of the age-standardized mortality rate in 98.5% of counties. However, 
the rate of death from cardiovascular diseases was far from uniform, with rates among 
counties in the 90thpercentile147.0deathsper100 000populationhigherthan rates among 
counties in the 10th percentile. The highest rates in 2014 were observed in counties in a 
band stretching from Oklahoma to Mississippi and in eastern Kentucky. Conversely, the 
lowest rates were observed in counties in central Colorado and near the border of Idaho, 
Montana, and Wyoming. Between 1980 and 2014, cardiovascular disease mortality 
decreased by 50.2% (95% UI, 49.5%–50.8%) overall. However, while nearly every county 
experienced a decline in cardiovascular disease mortality during this period (statistically 
significant in 99.9% of counties), the rate of decline was highly variable. Particularly slow 
rates of improvement were observed in many of the same counties in the band of south-
central states stretching from Oklahoma to Alabama and Kentucky that had the highest 
mortality rates in 2014.
Diabetes, Urogenital, Blood, and Endocrine Diseases
Diabetes, urogenital, blood, and endocrine diseases (Figure 3) caused 4 909 377 deaths 
(6.1%) from 1980 through 2014 and were the third leading cause of YLLs and fourth 
leading cause of deaths in 2014. In 2014, there was a difference of 41.2 deaths per 100 000 
population in the mortality rates from these diseases between counties in the 90th and 10th 
percentiles. Counties throughout much of the south and mid-Atlantic had mortality rates that 
were higher than average. Mortality rates were particularly high in counties in Arkansas, 
Louisiana, and Mississippi along the Mississippi River and in counties in North Dakota and 
South Dakota with Native American reservations. The mortality rate from this cause 
increased by 21.0% (95% UI, 16.9%–24.9%) overall between 1980 and 2014. Similarly, 
91.5% of counties had an increase in mortality rates from these diseases (statistically 
significant in 84.8% of counties). However, pockets of counties in Maryland, central 
Colorado, and north and western Alaska as well as individual counties throughout the rest of 
the country experienced declines in mortality from this cause during the same period.
Neurological Disorders
Neurological disorders (Figure 4) caused 3 971 426 deaths (4.9%) between 1980 and 2014 
and were the fourth leading cause of YLLs and the third leading cause of deaths in 2014. In 
2014, counties in the 90th percentile had mortality rates 55.7 deaths per 100 000 population 
higher than counties in the 10th percentile. Compared with most of the other causes 
considered, broad regional geographic trends were less prominent and there was more local 
geographic heterogeneity: counties with relatively high and relatively low mortality rates 
from neurological disorders were found throughout the country. Between 1980 and 2014, the 
mortality rate from neurological disorders increased by 18.7% (95% UI, 15.7%–21.9%) 
overall. Most counties (76.2%) experienced an increase during this period (statistically 
significant in 61.8%), and especially large increases were observed in southern counties 
stretching from eastern Texas and Oklahoma to Alabama. Notable declines in mortality were 
found in counties in the west stretching from central Idaho and western Montana to central 
Colorado.

 Self-harm and Interpersonal Violence
Self-harm and interpersonal violence (Figure 5) caused 2 049 835 deaths (2.5%) between 
1980 and 2014 and were the fifth leading cause of YLLs and the eighth leading cause of 
deaths in 2014. In 2014, counties in the 90th percentile had mortality rates 15.9 deaths per 
100 000 population higher than counties in the 10th percentile. The highest mortality rates 
were observed in counties in Alaska, in Native American reservations in North Dakota and 
South Dakota, and in states in the southwest, while lower rates were found in the upper 
Midwest, New England, southwestern Texas, and southern California. The mortality rate 
from self-harm and interpersonal violence declined by 22.1% (95% UI, 18.9%–25.3%) 
overall between 1980 and 2014, but changes at the county level were highly variable, with 
substantial declines in counties in southern California, Texas, and states along the Atlantic 
coast from Florida to Virginia, while counties in Utah, Oklahoma and Kansas, along the 
Canadian border in North Dakota and Michigan, and parts of the Midwest and New England 
experienced similarly substantial increases. In total, 48.8% of counties experienced declines 
in mortality from self-harm and interpersonal violence from 1980 to 2014, while 51.2% 
experienced increases (these changes were statistically significant in 29.0% and 25.7% of 
counties, respectively).
Chronic Respiratory Diseases
Chronic respiratory diseases (Figure 6) caused 4 616 711 deaths (5.7%) between 1980 and 
2014 and were the sixth leading cause of YLLs and the fifth leading cause of deaths in 2014. 
As with other causes, there was substantial between-county variation in the mortality rate, 
with a difference of 41.1 deaths per 100 000 population between counties in the 90th and 
10th percentiles. Elevated mortality rates were observed in a prominent cluster in eastern 
Kentucky and West Virginia and in a second cluster in southeastern Colorado, while the 
lowest mortality rates were found in the Washington, DC, area, the upper Midwest, southern 
Florida, southern Texas, and central Colorado. Between 1980 and 2014, mortality rates 
increased in a majority of counties (93.2%; statistically significant in 88.3%), with 
particularly sizable increases observed among counties in a band through the south from 
northern Texas to North Carolina and South Carolina. During the same period, a smaller 
number of counties, primarily along the Mexico border, in northwestern New Mexico, 
central Colorado, and southwestern Montana, near Washington, DC, and in eastern 
Pennsylvania, experienced moderate declines.
Transport Injuries
Transport injuries (Figure 7) caused 1 787 070 deaths (2.2%) between 1980 and 2014 and 
were the seventh leading cause of YLLs and the 11th leading cause of deaths in 2014. 
Counties in the 90th percentile experienced mortality rates 23.1 deaths per 100 000 
population higher than counties in the 10th percentile. In general, lower mortality rates were 
found in more urban areas, while higher mortality rates were found in more rural areas. The 
mortality rate from transport injuries declined for the United States as a whole by 45.4% 
(95% UI, 43.3%–47.5%) between 1980 and 2014. Most counties also experienced a decline 
during this period (98.5%; statistically significant in 93.6%), but to varying degrees. 
Counties in the central United States generally saw smaller improvements, while counties in

 the west, northern Midwest, New England, and southern Florida experienced more 
substantial declines.
Mental and Substance Use Disorders
Mental and substance use disorders (Figure 8) caused 814 391 deaths (1.0%) between 1980 
and 2014 and were ranked eighth in terms of YLLs and 12th in terms of deaths in 2014. 
Mortality rates among counties in the 90th percentile were 15.0 deaths per 100 000 
population higher than among counties in the 10th percentile. Exceptionally high mortality 
rates were found in a cluster of counties in eastern Kentucky and southwestern West 
Virginia; in counties in North Dakota, South Dakota, and southwestern states with Native 
American reservations; and in Alaska. Conversely, the lowest rates in 2014 were found 
primarily in counties in Nebraska, Iowa, and eastern South Dakota. The mortality rate due to 
mental and substance use disorders increased by 188% (95% UI, 160%–207%) overall 
between 1980 and 2014 and also increased in nearly every county (99.1%; statistically 
significant in 96.2%). However, the amount of increase varied dramatically across counties. 
In particular, there were several clusters of counties (in Kentucky, West Virginia, Ohio, 
Indiana, western Pennsylvania, and east-central Missouri) where mortality rates increased by 
more than 1000% during this period.
Cirrhosis and Other Chronic Liver Diseases
Cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases (Figure 9) caused 1 506 985 deaths (1.9%) 
between 1980 and 2014 and were the ninth-ranked cause of YLLs and deaths in 2014. At the 
county level, mortality rates in the 90th percentile were 14.0 deaths per 100 000 population 
higher than mortality rates in the 10th percentile. Counties in eastern Arizona, New Mexico, 
and south and western Texas and in selected counties in Colorado, Nevada, Wyoming, 
Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota had the highest mortality rates, while counties in 
eastern South Dakota and Kansas as well as in Iowa and southern Minnesota had the lowest 
mortality rates. Between 1980 and 2014, the mortality rate from this cause declined by 
15.6% (95% UI, 9.1%–26.9%) overall but increased in 69.6% of counties (statistically 
significant in 25.9%), with particularly large increases in southwestern Oregon and 
northwestern Texas.
Diarrhea, Lower Respiratory, and Other Common Infectious Diseases
Diarrhea, lower respiratory, and other common infectious diseases (Figure 10) were 
responsible for 3 234 692 deaths (4.0%) between 1980 and 2014 and were the 10th leading 
cause of YLLs and the sixth leading cause of deaths in 2014. Counties in the 90th percentile 
experienced mortality rates 25.8 deaths per 100 000 population higher than those in the 10th 
percentile. Mortality rates from this cause were highest in counties in southern states from 
Louisiana and Arkansas to Georgia, Tennessee, and Kentucky, while rates were lower than 
average in southern Florida, New England, the upper Midwest, central Colorado, and the 
Pacific Northwest. Nationally, the mortality rate from this cause declined by 22.1% (95% 
UI, 18.0%–26.8%) between 1980 and 2014. However, 28.3% of counties experienced 
increases in this mortality rate during the same period (statistically significant in 13.5%), 
with especially large increases found in counties in Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, 
Alabama, southern Illinois, and eastern Kentucky.

 Discussion
Using a novel method, this study estimated county-level mortality rates by cause for 21 
major causes of death. This analysis improves on previous analyses in 3 ways. First, the 
scope of this analysis was much larger than in previous studies: this is the first study, to our 
knowledge, that considered a comprehensive set of causes over an extended period. Second, 
this analysis used garbage code redistribution methods to reassign deaths originally 
classified using insufficiently specific or implausible cause of death codes. To our 
knowledge, garbage code redistribution methods have not previously been used at the county 
level. Third, this analysis used new small area estimation methods that generated more 
precise estimates and more accurately quantified uncertainty compared with models 
previously used. As a consequence of these advances, the results of this study represent the 
most detailed and comprehensive accounting of county-level patterns of cause-specific 
mortality currently available.
Geographic patterns differed significantly across causes, underscoring the importance of 
considering cause-specific mortality in addition to measures of all-cause mortality such as 
life expectancy. For some causes (eg, cardiovascular diseases), counties in the south and 
Appalachia had elevated mortality, while counties in western states had mortality much 
lower than average, a pattern that, broadly speaking, has also been documented in maps of 
life expectancy as well as maps of risk factors such as smoking, physical inactivity, and 
obesity.1,26,27 However, other causes had very different geographic patterns. Moreover, for 
some causes (eg, mental and substance use disorders), there were striking clusters of 
counties with very high mortality rates. Geographic patterns in changes over time were 
similarly variable among causes.
Information on cause-specific mortality rates and rankings among causes has long been 
available at the national level19–21,28 and has been widely used for public health planning 
and policy making, but to our knowledge this analysis is the first to consider an exhaustive 
set of causes of death at the county level and to track changes over an extended period at this 
level. There are a number of potential uses for these estimates: state and county health 
departments could use county-level mortality estimates to identify pressing local needs and 
to tailor policies and programs accordingly; physicians could use these estimates to better 
understand the health concerns of the populations they serve; researchers could identify 
counties that have done unexpectedly well or poorly with regard to a particular cause of 
death and that warrant additional study to identify factors driving these trends; and 
communities can use these estimates as evidence when advocating for change. Further, for 
causes of death for which effective treatments are available, variation in mortality rates can 
highlight where access to treatment or quality of care is a pressing problem. Additionally, 
local-level estimates of mortality, and particularly cause-specific mortality, provide a 
mechanism for evaluating the effect of policies and programs implemented in some, but not 
all, localities. More detailed cause-specific information will further enhance the utility of 
this type of analysis to all of these stakeholders, and in the future we plan to carry out more 
detailed analyses at the third and fourth levels of the GBD cause hierarchy using the 
framework outlined in this analysis.

 This study has several important limitations. First, the death registration data do not include 
deaths of US residents that occurred outside the United States, although these deaths are a 
very small percentage of the total. Second, the population counts were based on intercensal 
interpolations and postcensal projections that may be subject to error. Likewise, the 
covariates incorporated in the small area models were based on census and other 
administrative data and may also be subject to error.
Third, the garbage code redistribution methods used in this analysis have not been validated 
against a gold standard, such as autopsy, owing to insufficient data. However, several 
findings support the validity of the redistribution algorithm: redistribution reduces or 
eliminates discontinuities in temporal trends that coincide with revisions to the ICD for 
some causes (eg, ischemic heart disease), resulting in more plausible time trends9; 
redistribution results in more plausible geographic patterns across and within countries 
based on existing knowledge of the distribution of risks (eg, more reasonable patterns of 
ischemic heart disease mortality given knowledge of the distribution of related risk 
factors)29; and in a small number of cases in which hospital linkage studies have been used 
to examine the cause of death in cases for which death certificates list garbage codes, the 
results are broadly consistent with the effect of the redistribution algorithms.
Fourth, although the garbage code redistribution methods used in this analysis may be 
subject to error, this uncertainty is difficult to quantify and has not been accounted for in the 
reported UIs. Fifth, it is possible that the large increases over time observed for some causes 
of deaths are driven by changing registration practices and growing recognition among 
physicians of these particular causes of death. This is particularly true of Alzheimer disease 
and other dementias.30 However, the county-level estimates were raked to national-level 
estimates that incorporated prevalence data not subject to this same limitation, and this may 
have reduced this error. Sixth, small area models were used to more precisely estimate 
mortality rates, although there may be some situations in which these models were 
suboptimal. In particular, the models used in this analysis smoothed over time, space, and 
age group. As a result, unusually high or low mortality rates may have been attenuated, 
particularly in small counties, leading to an underestimation of geographic inequalities.
Conclusions
In this analysis of US cause-specific county-level mortality rates from 1980 through 2014, 
there were large between-county differences for every cause of death, although geographic 
patterns varied substantially by cause of death. The approach to county-level analyses with 
small area models used in this study has the potential to provide novel insights into US 
disease-specific mortality time trends and their differences across geographic regions.

 Key Points
Question
How do levels and trends in cause-specific mortality rates for 21 major causes of death 
vary by county within the United States?
Findings
Using a novel method, this analysis found significant variation in mortality rates and 
changes in mortality rates among counties for all causes of death. For example, in 2014, 
counties in the 90th percentile experienced mortality rates from neoplasms that were 
higher by 76.8 deaths per 100 000 population than counties in the 10th percentile.
Meaning
This method for estimating county-level cause-specific mortality rates has the potential to 
provide new insights into how mortality from different causes varies geographically in 
the United States.

A, Age-standardized mortality rate for both sexes combined in 2014. B, Percent change in 
the age-standardized mortality rate for both sexes combined between 1980 and 2014. A and 
B, The color scale is truncated at approximately the first and 99th percentiles as indicated by 
the range given in the color scale. C, Age-standardized mortality rate in 1980, 1990, 2000, 
and 2014. The bottom border, middle line, and top border of the boxes indicate the 25th, 
50th, and 75th percentiles, respectively, across all counties; whiskers, the full range across 
counties; and circles, the national-level rate.

 Figure 8. County-Level Mortality From Mental and Substance Use Disorders
A, Age-standardized mortality rate for both sexes combined in 2014. The color scale is 
truncated at approximately the first and 99th percentiles as indicated by the range given in 
the color scale. B, Percent change in the age-standardized mortality rate for both sexes 
combined between 1980 and 2014. The color scale is truncated at the 99th percentile but not 
at the first percentile, to avoid combining counties with decreases in the mortality rate and 
counties with increases in the mortality rate into a single group. C, Age-standardized 
mortality rate in 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2014. The bottom border, middle line, and top 
border of the boxes indicate the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles, respectively, across all 
counties; whiskers, the full range across counties; and circles, the national-level rate.
