Summary
Background As the prevalence of artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria increases in the Greater 
Mekong subregion, emerging resistance to partner drugs in artemisinin combination therapies seriously threatens 
global eff
 orts to treat and eliminate this disease. Molecular markers that predict failure of artemisinin combination 
therapy are urgently needed to monitor the spread of partner drug resistance, and to recommend alternative 
treatments in southeast Asia and beyond.
Methods We did a genome-wide association study of 297 P falciparum isolates from Cambodia to investigate the 
relationship of 11 630 exonic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 43 copy number variations (CNVs) with 
in-vitro piperaquine 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s), and tested whether these genetic variants are markers of 
treatment failure with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine. We then did a survival analysis of 133 patients to determine 
whether candidate molecular markers predicted parasite recrudescence following dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine 
treatment.
Findings Piperaquine IC50s increased signifi
 cantly from 2011 to 2013 in three Cambodian provinces (2011 vs 2013 
median IC50s: 20·0 nmol/L [IQR 13·7–29·0] vs 39·2 nmol/L [32·8–48·1] for Ratanakiri, 19·3 nmol/L [15·1–26·2] vs 
66·2 nmol/L [49·9–83·0] for Preah Vihear, and 19·6 nmol/L [11·9–33·9] vs 81·1 nmol/L [61·3–113·1] for Pursat; all 
p≤10–³; Kruskal-Wallis test). Genome-wide analysis of SNPs identifi
 ed a chromosome 13 region that associates with 
raised piperaquine IC50s. A non-synonymous SNP (encoding a Glu415Gly substitution) in this region, within a gene 
encoding an exonuclease, associates with parasite recrudescence following dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine 
treatment. Genome-wide analysis of CNVs revealed that a single copy of the mdr1 gene on chromosome 5 and a novel 
amplifi
 cation of the plasmepsin 2 and plasmepsin 3 genes on chromosome 14 also associate with raised piperaquine 
IC50s. After adjusting for covariates, both exo-E415G and plasmepsin 2–3 markers signifi
 cantly associate (p=3·0 × 10–⁸ 
and p=1·7 × 10–⁷, respectively) with decreased treatment effi
  cacy (survival rates 0·38 [95% CI 0·25–0·51] and 0·41 
[0·28–0·53], respectively).
Interpretation The exo-E415G SNP and plasmepsin 2–3 amplifi
 cation are markers of piperaquine resistance and 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine failures in Cambodia, and can help monitor the spread of these phenotypes into 
other countries of the Greater Mekong subregion, and elucidate the mechanism of piperaquine resistance. Since 
plasmepsins are involved in the parasite’s haemoglobin-to-haemozoin conversion pathway, targeted by related 
antimalarials, plasmepsin 2–3 amplifi
 cation probably mediates piperaquine resistance.

Introduction
Artemisinin combination therapy, the use of a short-
acting artemisinin derivative and a long-acting partner 
drug, is recommended worldwide for the treatment of 
Plasmodium falciparum malaria.1 Treatment with dihydro-
artemisinin–piperaquine, a current front-line artemisinin 
combination therapy in Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand, 
Myanmar, China, and Indonesia is now failing in 
Cambodian provinces where artemisinin resistance2 has 
emerged and spread.3–12 This situation probably arose 
because the survival of parasites after artemisinin 
exposure increases the chance that they develop 
spontaneous genetic resistance to piperaquine, survive 
declining piperaquine plasma concentrations, and 
propagate via mosquitoes to other human beings. 
Through such processes, artemisinin resistance, which 
has evolved across the Greater Mekong subregion,7,8,13 
threatens to compromise the effi
  cacy of dihydro-
artemisinin–piperaquine and other artemisinin com-
bination therapies in the global treatment and elimination

of malaria.14 The natural selection of low-frequency, pre-
existing resistance to piperaquine might also be occurring 
and further contributing to this problem.
Recent increases in treatment failures with dihydro-
artemisinin–piperaquine4,9,11,12 
and 
piperaquine 
50% 
inhibitory 
concentrations 
(IC50s)15 
suggest 
that 
piperaquine resistance has emerged in Cambodia. These 
fi
 ndings, and the discovery that piperaquine-resistant 
parasites are sensitive to the former artemisinin 
combination therapy partner drug mefl
 oquine,4 have 
recently led Cambodia’s national malaria control 
programme and WHO to recommend artesunate–
mefl
 oquine as the fi
 rst-line artemisinin combination 
therapy in ten Cambodian provinces, including Pursat 
and Preah Vihear. Molecular markers are urgently needed 
for large-scale surveillance programmes to predict 
treatment failures with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine 
in Cambodia and other countries in the Greater Mekong 
subregion, and investigate the molecular mechanism of 
piperaquine resistance.
Several genetic variations have been associated 
with decreased piperaquine susceptibility: a single 
copy of the mdr1 gene has been associated with 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine treatment failures in 
Cambodian patients,4 whereas amplifi
 cation of a region 
downstream of mdr1 and the crt single-nucleotide 
polymorphism (SNP) C101F has been associated with 
raised piperaquine IC50s in vitro.16 These genetic variants 
are not useful as molecular markers, however, because 
the fi
 rst is wild type, the second is very uncommon, and 
the third has not yet been observed in MalariaGEN 
P falciparum Community Project’s global catalogue of 
variation in clinical samples. Another study11 found that 
a triple mutation (kelch13-C580Y, MAL10:688956 SNP, 
and MAL13:1718319 SNP) linked with slow parasite 
clearance is associated with a 5·4 times greater risk of 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine treatment failure in 
Cambodia’s Oddar Meancheay province; however, these 
SNPs were not linked to piperaquine resistance.
The purpose of this genome-wide association study 
(GWAS) was to discover molecular markers of 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine treatment failures in 
Cambodia. In designing it, we reasoned that such markers 
would associate with raised piperaquine IC50s, increase 
in prevalence over time in areas where artemisinin 
resistance is common, and be uncommon where 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed using the terms “artemisinin”, 
“piperaquine”, “resistance”, and “Cambodia” without any date 
or language restrictions. This search identifi
 ed 26 articles, 
fi
 ve of which reported original clinical trials that documented 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine failures in the treatment of 
uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Cambodia. 
Collectively, these studies reported failure rates of 11–54% for 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine in Pailin, Pursat, Oddar 
Meancheay, and Preah Vihear provinces in 2010–13, and 
associated an increased risk of treatment failure with several 
parasite genotypes and phenotypes: the presence of kelch13 
gene mutations that confer artemisinin resistance; the 
presence of two mutations (MAL10:688956 and 
MAL13:1718319) linked to slow parasite clearance after 
artesunate treatment; the absence of mdr1 gene amplifi
 cation, 
a molecular marker of mefl
 oquine resistance; and decreased 
piperaquine susceptibility in vitro. These studies did not 
identify molecular markers of both dihydroartemisinin–
piperaquine failure and piperaquine resistance.
Added value of this study
This study, which investigated the whole-genome sequences 
and piperaquine susceptibilities of 297 P falciparum clinical 
isolates from Cambodia, provides two new molecular markers of 
piperaquine resistance and dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine 
failures. The fi
 rst marker is a single-nucleotide polymorphism, 
which encodes a glutamic acid-to-glycine aminoacid 
substitution, in a putative exonuclease gene. This exonuclease 
marker is associated with decreased piperaquine susceptibility in 
vitro, and a low rate (0·38) of dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine 
treatment effi
  cacy. This marker is found predominantly in 
Cambodia but not in other areas of the world where 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine has not been used. The second 
marker is an amplifi
 cation of the plasmepsin 2 and plasmepsin 3 
genes. This plasmepsin marker is also associated with decreased 
piperaquine susceptibility in vitro, and a low rate (0·41) of 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine treatment success. This marker 
is a strong candidate for causal mutation because plasmepsins 
encode aspartic proteases, which are involved in the parasite’s 
haemoglobin degradation pathway targeted by related 
antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine. These exonuclease and 
plasmepsin markers are commonly found together, along with 
kelch13 gene mutations, which confer artemisinin resistance, 
and a single copy of the mdr1 gene, which is associated with 
decreased piperaquine, but increased mefl
 oquine, susceptibility 
in vitro.
Implications of all the available evidence
In Cambodia, emerging treatment failure with 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine is associated with the presence 
of plasmepsin and exonuclease markers. The plasmepsin marker 
is a strong candidate for a functional polymorphism and can be 
used to monitor the spread of dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine 
treatment failures in Cambodia and neighbouring countries in 
mainland southeast Asia, where dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine 
is a fi
 rst-line treatment for malaria. Mapping the extent of this 
marker will enable national malaria control programmes to 
immediately recommend alternative therapies to improve the 
treatment of patients and drive the elimination of malaria.

dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine has not been used. 
Therefore, we sequenced the genomes and measured the 
piperaquine IC50s of parasites collected in 2010–13 from 
patients with P falciparum malaria in Pursat, Preah Vihear, 
and Ratanakiri, where the prevalences of kelch13 
mutations, genetic markers for artemisinin resistance,6,7,17 
were 77%, 34%, and 11%,4 and where the prevalences of 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine treatment failures were 
46%, 16%, and 2%,4 respectively, in 2012–13.
Methods
Study design and participants
To obtain samples for this GWAS study, we enrolled 
patients with uncomplicated P falciparum malaria into 
parasite clearance rate3,7 and drug effi
  cacy4 studies in 
2010–13 in three provinces where piperaquine resistance is 
common (Pursat), emerging (Preah Vihear), or uncommon 
(Ratanakiri). Written informed consent was given by adult 
patients, or a parent or guardian of child patients. Protocols 
were approved by the Cambodian National Ethics 
Committee for Health Research and the National Institute 
of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Institutional Review 
Board and are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers 
NCT00341003, NCT01240603, and NCT01736319.
Using parasitised blood samples from these studies, 
we measured piperaquine IC50s ex vivo or after short-
term culture in vitro, and obtained whole-genome 
parasite sequence data, whenever possible. The GWAS 
was designed to identify genetic markers of raised 
piperaquine IC50s, whereas a dihydroartemisinin–
piperaquine effi
  cacy study4 was used to test for association 
between GWAS candidate markers and parasite 
recrudescence. PCR genotyping using msp1, msp2, and 
glurp microsatellites as genetic markers distinguished 
recrudescences from newly acquired infections.18 A 
summary of samples, according to province of origin and 
year of collection, is shown in the appendix.
GWAS and survival analyses
The preparation, sequencing, genotyping, and phenotyping 
of samples are described in the appendix. The GWAS and 
correction for population structure were done using a 
linear mixed model, implemented in FaST-LMM19 version 
2.06.17 We tested 11 630 SNPs with minor allele frequency 
greater than 0·033, using genotypes encoded as the 
number of non-reference alleles (0 or 1), and excluding 
heterozygous calls to minimise confounding eff
 ects of 
mixed infections. Piperaquine IC50 was used as the 
continuous dependent variable. When whole-genome 
sequence or phenotype data were available for both initial 
and recrudescent samples, we only analysed data from the 
recrudescent samples. Diff
 erent approaches (using initial 
sample data only, using the phenotype and genotype of the 
same sample, averaging initial and recrudescent IC50s) did 
not alter results. A relationship matrix was calculated 
using a subset of 6678 SNPs with minor allele frequency 
greater than 3% (options: –maf 0·03), missing data rate 
below 25% (options: –geno 0·25), and unlinked (in 
windows of 100 SNPs, shifted forward by ten SNPs each 
time, removing one from each pair of SNPs with linkage 
disequilibrium >0·3; options: –indep-pairwise 100 10 0·3) 
and extracted using PLINK20 version 1.07
. In estimating the 
relationship matrix, we found that excluding proximal 
SNPs (within 10 kb or 100 kb from the tested variant) did 
not substantially aff
 ect results. Given the number of 
independent SNPs used, we applied Bonferroni correction 
to defi
 ne a signifi
 cance threshold of p of 8·6 × 10–⁷ or less 
for GWAS analyses. We also defi
 ned a suggestive threshold 
of p of 10–⁴ or less to identify relatively high-ranking loci.
To adjust for potential confounder eff
 ects, we treated 
the geographical origin of the sample, the presence of 
mdr1 amplifi
 cation, and the presence of kelch13 resistance 
alleles collectively as covariates in the linear mixed 
model. These covariates reduced the genomic infl
 ation 
factor λGC from 3·455 to 1·964 (appendix). We also treated 
genetic similarity across samples as a random eff
 ect to 
correct for confounding eff
 ects of population structure, 
which further reduced λGC to 1·106. Although this value is 
still slightly above 1·0, this is unlikely due to un-accounted 
population stratifi
 cation. When we confi
 ned the 
estimation of λGC to only unlinked SNPs, its value 
dropped to 1·013, suggesting that residual infl
 ation is 
due to extended homozygosity haplotypes in the samples 
and thus has little eff
 ect on the GWAS.
We did a survival analysis using the R package 
survival. We fi
 tted a Cox proportional hazard regression 
model, in which treatment success (recrudescent vs 
non-recrudescent infection) represented the survival 
status, and we added the age of the patient (in years), 
parasitaemia on day 0 (log-scaled), and dose of 
piperaquine given (mg/kg, in fi
 ve-unit increments 
starting at 35 mg/kg) as covariates.21 We then included 
the two markers (exo-E415G and plasmepsin 2–3) as 
covariates, and estimated adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) 
and adjusted survival curves.
Copy number variations
We subsequently tested the association of copy number 
variations (CNVs) with piperaquine IC50s using the same 
method and parameters just described. We tested 
43 CNVs present in at least fi
 ve samples; genotypes 
represented the presence or absence (encoded as 0 or 1) 
of the CNV. In this analysis, mdr1 amplifi
 cation was not 
included as a covariate in the linear mixed model. To call 
CNVs across the genome, we modifi
 ed a procedure used 
previously.22,23 Briefl
 y, we fi
 rst divided the genome into 
300 bp non-overlapping bins and calculated for each 
sample the number of reads whose alignment started 
within each bin. We then normalised these binned read 
counts by dividing by the median read count of the core 
regions of chromosome 9. We excluded bins where 
guanine–cytosine (GC) content was less than 20% due to 
coverage bias in most samples. Copy number state for 
each bin was predicted in each sample by fi
 tting a

Gaussian hidden Markov model to the normalised 
coverage data.
After determining the most likely state for each window 
(Viterbi algorithm), in each sample independently we 
merged adjacent windows having the same state 
prediction and allowed a maximum gap of 5000 bp 
between them. We then further removed windows less 
than 700 bp or not supported by face-away reads, and data 
for 43 samples with excessive variation in read coverage. 
This led to the identifi
 cation of a median six CNVs per 
sample. Finally, we merged all the CNV calls across the 
samples, by considering any partial overlap. In total, we 
identifi
 ed 134 regions containing CNVs across the core 
genome; 43 of these CNVs were present in at least 
fi
 ve samples and were tested for association with the 
phenotype, as described above. For the 133 samples in the 
clinical study used for the survival analysis, we manually 
inspected each sample individually and scanned them for 
the presence of reads spanning the breakpoints.

Results
We analysed 486 P falciparum clinical isolates collected 
between July 9, 2010, and Dec 31, 2013, in three 
Cambodian provinces where artemisinin resistance is 
entrenched (Pursat), emerging (Preah Vihear), and 
uncommon (Ratanakiri; appendix).3,4,7 To monitor the 
evolution of piperaquine resistance, we measured 
piperaquine IC50s for 297 P falciparum clinical isolates 
obtained directly from patients (ex vivo, 275 [93%] of 297) 
or following short-term culture (in vitro, 22 [7%] of 297) 
in 2011, 2012, and 2013. In all three provinces, IC50s 
increased signifi
 cantly over time, especially when 
comparing province-stratifi
 ed data from 2011 and 2013 
(Kruskal-Wallis test, all p≤10–³; appendix). Despite 
parasites having comparable IC50s at all sites in 2011 
(medians 20·0 nmol/L [IQR 13·7–29·0], 19·3 nmol/L 
[15·1–26·2], and 19·6 nmol/L [11·9–33·9] for Ratanakiri, 
Preah Vihear, and Pursat, respectively), they were 
remarkably diff
 erentiated at all sites by 2013, showing 
about two, three, and four times increases in IC50s 
(medians 39·2 nmol/L [IQR 32·8–48·1], 66·2 nmol/L 
[49·9–83·0], and 81·1 nmol/L [61·3–113·1], respectively). 
These regional diff
 erences are consistent with the relative 
prevalences of artemisinin-resistant parasites and 
recrudescent parasitaemias following dihydroartemisinin–
piperaquine therapy.4,7
To investigate the genetic basis of piperaquine 
resistance in vitro, we did a GWAS analysis of the 
297 samples (appendix) for which we had both 
piperaquine IC50s and whole-genome sequences (see 
Methods). We tested 11 630 SNPs that were well covered 
in this set of samples, and where one of the two alleles 
was present in at least ten samples. IC50s were treated

putative exonuclease. The second strongest signal 
(p=2·3 × 10−⁷) from a non-synonymous variant is an SNP 
(referred to as mcp-N252D) within the same locus, 
producing an Asn252Asp substitution in a putative 
mitochondrial 
carrier 
protein 
1. 
A 
locus 
on 
chromosome 12 also reaches genome-wide signifi
 cance, 
but only with a single synonymous SNP. To exclude the 
possibility of a batch eff
 ect, we repeated the GWAS 
analysis by including the year of sample collection as a 
covariate in the linear mixed model (appendix). This 
analysis confi
 rmed the locus on chromosome 13 as the 
only one signifi
 cantly associated with the phenotype. 
When also correcting for year, mcp-N252D is the only 
SNP to reach genome-wide signifi
 cance (p=7·3 × 10−⁷), 
although exo-E415G is just below the threshold 
(p=1·3 × 10−⁶). These data indicate that the chromosome 
13 locus (referred to as L13) shows multiple signifi
 cant 
GWAS hits that are robust to multiple corrections.
To prioritise the multiple GWAS hits, we analysed their 
geographical spread, on the assumption that piperaquine 
resistance is emerging in Cambodia and neighbouring 
countries where dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine therapy 
is used (appendix). Taken together, the results of the GWAS 
and global allele frequency survey identify exo-E415G as the 
best candidate SNP marker of piperaquine resistance.
To gain a better picture of its frequency distribution in 
Cambodia, we used Sanger sequencing of PCR-amplifi
 ed 
DNA fragments to genotype this SNP (ie, exo-E415G) in 
168 additional samples for which whole-genome sequence 
data were not available, from the same initial cohort of 
241 patients.4 As expected, given the low p value of this 
SNP in the GWAS, the phenotype distribution diff
 ers 
signifi
 cantly between the wild-type and the mutant alleles. 
When stratifi
 ed by province and year, the association 
seems to be particularly strong in Pursat and Preah Vihear 
(fi
 gure 1B, appendix), and from 2012 onwards (appendix). 
Consistent with these results, the frequency of exo-E415G 
appears to increase in Pursat and Preah Vihear over time 
(fi
 gure 1C, table 2). In summary, exo-E415G is the best 
predictor of raised IC50s in the current dataset, although 
this fi
 nding alone is insuffi
  cient to infer a causal role for it 
in mediating piperaquine resistance.
Since gene CNVs have also been associated with 
drug resistance in P falciparum,24 we investigated the 
association of piperaquine IC50s with 43 genomic regions 
exhibiting CNVs in at least fi
 ve samples. We did a GWAS 
using the same method we used in the SNP GWAS, 
except that genotypes were the presence or absence of 
the CNV in each sample. We found that two CNVs 
strongly associated with IC50s (p≤2·3 × 10−⁴; fi
 gure 2A, 
appendix). As expected,4 mdr1 amplifi
 cation was 
associated (p=1·4 × 10−⁶) with low IC50s. However, the 
most signifi
 cant association (p=7·6 × 10−⁷) was found for 
a novel amplifi
 cation on chromosome 14, encompassing 
two of the ten plasmepsin genes in the P falciparum 
genome—plasmepsin 2 and plasmepsin 3—that encode 
aspartic proteases involved in the haemoglobin-to-
haemozoin conversion pathway targeted by quinolines.25
A detailed analysis of sequencing reads aligned 
within the plasmepsin 2–3 locus revealed that the 
amplifi
 cation boundaries were identical in all samples.

plasmepsin 3, except that an asparagine residue is 
replaced by two consecutive lysines.
The prevalence of plasmepsin 2–3 amplifi
 cation in our 
cohort shows a steady increase over time in Pursat and 
Preah Vihear compared with Ratanakiri (appendix), and 
refl
 ects our observations of increasing piperaquine IC50s 
and rising prevalence of exo-E415G in these two provinces 
(table 2, appendix). Despite being on diff
 erent chromo-
somes, exo-E415G and plasmepsin 2–3 amplifi
 cation are 
in signifi
 cant linkage disequilibrium (r²=0·56, empirical 
p=1·6 × 10–⁵; appendix), and have a very similar allele 
frequency distribution in these Cambodian data. In 
particular, of the 462 samples where both markers were 
reliably typed, 72% (n=334) have neither marker, 
19% (n=86) have both markers, and only 9% (n=42) have 
one of the two markers. Although the co-occurrence of 
the two markers in the population is interesting and 
surprising, the few samples where the two markers are 
found separately makes any conclusion regarding their 
relative eff
 ect on the phenotype diffi
  cult to support 
statistically (appendix).
To further investigate whether the exo-E415G and 
plasmepsin 2–3 amplifi
 cation markers segregate with a 
newly described piperaquine resistance phenotype, we 
subjected a subset of 12 clinical isolates in triplicate to the 
in-vitro piperaquine survival assay.26 In this assay, the 
survival of early ring-stage parasites following exposure to 
piperaquine for 48 h is assessed relative to non-exposed 
parasites tested in parallel. For these experiments, we 
selected two groups of parasites (appendix). In the fi
 rst 
group, parasites did not recrudesce after dihydro-
artemisinin–piperaquine treatment, had low piperaquine 
IC50s ex vivo and after cultivation in vitro, were wild type 
for kelch13 and exonuclease, and carried single copies of 
mdr1 and plasmepsins 2–3. In the second group, parasites 
recrudesced after dihydro 
artemisinin–piperaquine treat-
ment, had high piperaquine IC50s ex vivo and after 
cultivation in vitro, carried single copies of mdr1, and 
harboured the following mutations: kelch13-C580Y, 
exo-E415G, and plasmepsin 2–3 amplifi
 cation. This second 
group of parasites showed signifi
 cantly higher piperaquine 
survival rates (median 61·6 nmol/L [IQR 56·8–67·0]; n=6) 
than the fi
 rst (2·4 nmol/L [1·6–2·9]; n=6; p=0·002). The 
relationship between raised piperaquine survival rate and 
the presence of either exo-E415G or plasmepsin 2–3 
amplifi
 cation were fully concordant.
Given that exo-E415G and plasmepsin 2–3 amplifi
 cation 
are associated with raised piperaquine IC50s and survival 
rates, which, in turn, have been associated with parasite 
recrudescence,4,26 we directly tested their association with 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine 
failures. 
Of 
the 
241 samples with clinical outcome data, we analysed a 
subset of 133 samples for which we had complete genetic 
and clinical information (appendix). Both exo-E415G and 
plasmepsin 2–3 amplifi
 cation mutants showed a highly 
signifi
 cant 
enrichment 
in 
recrudescent 
samples 
(p=1·6 × 10–⁸ and 1·8 × 10–¹¹, respectively, Fisher’s exact 
test; appendix), with aHRs of recrudescence of 
13·4 (95% CI 5·3–33·5; p=3·0 × 10–⁸) and 16·7 
(5·8–48·1; p=1·7 × 10–7), respectively. Furthermore, the 
aHR for plasmepsin 2–3 amplifi
 cation is still signifi
 cant 
(5·2 [95% CI 1·5–17·7]; p=8·6 × 10–³) when only kelch13 
mutants were considered, suggesting that whereas 
artemisinin resistance is certainly a risk factor, plasmepsin 
2–3 
amplifi
 cation 
potentially 
has 
an 
additional, 
independent eff
 ect on piperaquine resistance and, 
ultimately, dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine treat 
ment 
failure. To explicitly clarify the eff
 ect of the two markers 
on treatment success, we analysed the survival rate in 
samples with or without the two markers. We found that 
the adjusted survival rates at 63 days in the presence or 
absence of exo-E415G were 0·38 (95% CI 0·25–0·51) and 
0·93 (0·85–0·97; fi
 gure 3A), respectively. Samples with or 
without plasmepsin 2–3 amplifi
 cation had survival rates of 
0·41 (95% CI 0·28–0·53) and 0·95 (0·87–0·98; fi
 gure 3B), 
respectively. Considering that non-recrudescent infec-
tions are not necessarily indicators of drug sensitivity, 
these values are likely underestimated. Together, these 
data identify exo-E415G and plasmepsin 2–3 amplifi
 cation 
as strongly predictive markers of dihydroartemisinin–
piperaquine treatment failures in Cambodia.

 cation of 
the plasmepsin 2 and plasmepsin 3 genes (plasmepsin 2–3 
amplifi
 cation). The prevalence of these two markers has 
increased substantially in recent years in Pursat and 
Preah Vihear, where artemisinin resistance is prevalent 
and where dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine has been

the front-line artemisinin combination therapy since 
2008 and 2010, respectively. In a global dataset of SNP 
allele frequencies, the exo-E415G allele is observed only 
in eastern mainland southeast Asia, where dihydro-
artemisinin–piperaquine is used, and completely 
absent where this artemisinin combination therapy has 
not been used.
Of the associated variations found in this study, 
plasmepsin 2–3 amplifi
 cation is the strongest candidate 
for mediating piperaquine resistance because of the role 
of plasmepsins in haemozoin synthesis pathways in the 
parasite 
food 
vacuole. 
Since 
piperaquine, 
like 
chloroquine, is believed to inhibit the conversion of toxic 
haem moieties to non-toxic haemozoin crystals during 
haemoglobin digestion, it is possible that piperaquine 
targets plasmepsin 2, plasmepsin 3, or both, and that 
overproducton of these plasmepsins counteracts the 
drug’s action. The SNP markers, exo-E415G and mcp-
N252D, do not lend themselves to an equally simple 
explanation and, until functional studies are done, it will 
not be possible to determine whether either is directly 
involved in mediating piperaquine resistance, whether 
their role is compensatory for lost fi
 tness in piperaquine-
resistant mutants, or whether they are associated with 
piperaquine resistance simply because of their strong 
linkage to plasmepsin 2–3 amplifi
 cation or some other 
functional mutation in the Cambodian parasite 
populations.
Assigning a role to the single copy variant of mdr1, 
which is associated with lower sensitivity to piperaquine, 
is equally problematic. Although it is possible that mdr1 
plays a functional part in piperaquine resistance (eg, by 
restricting the amount of drug that enters the parasite’s 
food vacuole), recent changes in Cambodia’s anti-
malarial drug policy have caused a decline in mefl
 oquine 
pressure, which might have promoted the loss of mdr1 
amplifi
 cations in the parasite populations. In view of 
the pronounced population structure following the 
emergence of artemisinin resistance in Cambodia,27 it is 
possible that the association with a single copy of mdr1 
is the result of piperaquine resistance having emerged 
in specifi
 c artemisinin-resistant, mefl
 oquine-sensitive 
populations.
Taken together, these fi
 ndings identify plasmepsin 
2–3 amplifi
 cation as the most likely candidate to be a 
causal variant of piperaquine resistance. In the samples 
studied here, it is strongly linked to exo-E415G, which 
is on a diff
 erent chromosome and might represent 
some other functional component of the resistance 
phenotype. In practice, this means that the exo-E415G 
SNP can be presently used as a predictive marker of 
piperaquine resistance in Cambodia; however, this 
might not be the case elsewhere. Therefore, plasmepsin 
2–3 amplifi
 cation should be monitored in areas where 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine is used, although it is 
somewhat more laborious to genotype. Despite un-
resolved questions about causal mechanism, we now 
have tools to identify areas where treatment failures 
with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine are likely to 
occur, and thereby to empower national malaria control 
programmes to make informed dec 
isions about 
whether 
to 
switch 
to 
alternative 
artemisinin 
combination therapies for fi
 rst-line treatment of P 
falciparum malaria.
