ecent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of 
immune regulation have led to major clinical breakthroughs 
in cancer, including the use of inhibitors of the PD-1/PD-L1 
(PD-(L)1) axis, or ‘checkpoint blockade’1–3. PD-(L)1 signaling is 
central to both initial T cell priming and later T cell exhaustion, 
which occurs with aging or chronic antigen stimulation resulting 
in impairment of proliferative and functional abilities4. Blockade 
of this pathway markedly augments T cell responses in a vari-
ety of viral and cancer models5–8. However, despite the success of 
PD-(L)1 blockade in multiple malignancies including melanoma 
and lung, renal, and bladder cancer, these therapies fail to generate 
sustained benefits in most patients. Extensive efforts are underway 
to elucidate biomarkers and mechanisms of response9. Many stud-
ies have focused on the tumor microenvironment (TME) as well as 
mutational or antigenic load, but patient-associated factors such as 
sex, age, body mass index (BMI) and immunological history (for 
example, pathogen exposure) are also likely to profoundly impact 
immune responses and yet are poorly understood.

Obesity, defined by increased BMI (≥ 
30 kg/m2), reflecting vis-
ceral fat accumulation10, is reaching pandemic proportions. Obesity 
has been associated with numerous comorbidities such as diabetes, 
heart disease and cancer10–12 and represents a significant societal bur-
den accounting for > 
20% of the total annual U.S. healthcare expen-
diture13. Although obesity is characterized by a ‘meta-inflammatory’

The recent successes of immunotherapy have shifted the paradigm in cancer treatment, but because only a percentage of 
patients are responsive to immunotherapy, it is imperative to identify factors impacting outcome. Obesity is reaching pandemic 
proportions and is a major risk factor for certain malignancies, but the impact of obesity on immune responses, in general and 
in cancer immunotherapy, is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate, across multiple species and tumor models, that obesity 
results in increased immune aging, tumor progression and PD-1-mediated T cell dysfunction which is driven, at least in part, by 
leptin. However, obesity is also associated with increased efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in both tumor-bearing mice and clini-
cal cancer patients. These findings advance our understanding of obesity-induced immune dysfunction and its consequences 
in cancer and highlight obesity as a biomarker for some cancer immunotherapies. These data indicate a paradoxical impact of 
obesity on cancer. There is heightened immune dysfunction and tumor progression but also greater anti-tumor efficacy and 
survival after checkpoint blockade which directly targets some of the pathways activated in obesity.

state with dysregulated immune responses and ‘inflammaging’12, lit-
tle is understood about the impact of obesity on immune responses 
during cancer progression and immunotherapy. This is confounded 
by the use, in most preclinical cancer models, of young lean mice that 
fail to recapitulate the clinical scenario of the elderly cancer patient. 
Surprisingly, recent clinical analyses demonstrate that obesity is 
associated with improved response and survival of cancer patients 
treated with targeted therapy and checkpoint blockade immuno-
therapy, although a mechanistic link was not elucidated14,15. In this 
study, we investigated the impact of obesity on T cell responses and 
demonstrate a significant impact of obesity on the PD-(L)1 axis, 
immune aging and dysfunction across multiple species and cancer 
models. In particular, we demonstrate a marked effect of obesity on 
tumor progression in mice as well as on clinical outcomes in can-
cer patients treated with PD-(L)1 checkpoint blockade stratified by 
body mass. These studies highlight the contrasting and paradoxi-
cal effects, both positive and negative, of obesity on cancer immune 
responses in the context of immunotherapy.
Results
Obesity-related T cell dysfunction across multiple species. We 
investigated T cell phenotype and function in control-diet mice 
(control, 10% fat diet) versus diet-induced obese mice (DIO, 60% 
fat diet) at 6 months (Supplementary Fig. 1a–g) and 11–12 months 
of age (Fig. 1a–f and Supplementary Figs. 2, 3). DIO mice had a 
marked increase in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue, as 
demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging (Supplementary 
Fig. 3a,b). Non-fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels were 
within normal limits in both DIO and control mice (Supplementary 
Figs. 1b,c, 2a). At 6 months of age, DIO mice had an increased fre-
quency of PD-1+ T cells in the liver (Supplementary Fig. 1f,g). By 
11–12 months of age, DIO mice exhibited a significant increase 
in dysfunctional exhausted T cells in peripheral blood, liver, and 
spleen. Specifically, DIO mice had an increase in the frequency of 
memory T cells in the peripheral blood (Supplementary Fig. 2b) 
and liver (Fig. 1b). Further analysis showed a > 
2-fold increase 
in PD-1 expression in DIO versus control T cells (Fig. 1c and 
Supplementary Fig. 2c). Similar results were seen when examining 
CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets in 6 and 11- to 12-month-old mice 
(Supplementary Figs. 1f,g, 2d,e). To determine whether increased 
PD-1 expression in DIO mice was indicative of T cell dysfunction, 
we examined hallmarks of exhaustion, including diminished prolif-
erative function and cytokine production. Ex vivo stimulated poly-
clonal T cells from DIO mice demonstrated reduced proliferative 
capacity, as well as reduced IFNγ 
 and TNFα 
 production compared 
with control (Fig. 1d,f), and, again, similar results were seen when 
examining CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets (Supplementary Fig. 3). 
We next assessed the impact of obesity in outbred non-human 
primates (NHP, rhesus macaques) and humans and observed a 
remarkably similar pattern. T cells from spontaneously obese NHPs 
demonstrated a significant increase in the memory pool and PD-1 
expression, while also showing reduced proliferative capacity com-
pared with non-obese NHP (Fig. 1g,h and Supplementary Fig. 4a–
f). Healthy human volunteers were categorized into obese (BMI≥ 
30) and non-obese (BMI< 
30) cohorts (Supplementary Fig. 4g and 
Supplementary Table 1). T cells from these obese donors also dem-
onstrated a significant increase in PD-1 expression and decreased 
proliferative function compared with non-obese donors (Fig. 1i,j). 
Thus, across multiple species, we observed increased T cell exhaus-
tion and dysfunction in obese subjects, providing novel data to sup-
port an obesity associated phenotype of immune dysfunction.
Obesity promotes tumor growth and T cell exhaustion. We next 
studied the consequences of obesity on tumor immunity. A con-
founding issue in preclinical cancer modeling is the direct impact 
that obesity has on tumor growth kinetics16, which may obscure the 
effects of obesity on the immune response to the tumor. B16 mela-
noma tumors grew significantly faster in 6-month old DIO mice 
compared with control counterparts (Fig. 2a and Supplementary 
Fig. 5a). Tumors in DIO mice exhibited increased metabolic activ-
ity as demonstrated by increased 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) 
uptake on positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomog-
raphy (CT) scans (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig.5b). We observed 
greater ulceration, necrosis, and invasion into subcutaneous fat by 
melanoma tumors in DIO mice (Supplementary Fig. 5c). Consistent 
with our previous findings in non-tumor bearing mice, T cells in the 
TME of DIO mice demonstrated features of exhaustion. Specifically, 
DIO mice had a significantly higher frequency of tumor-infiltrating 
CD8+ 
 T cells (CD8+ 
 TILs) expressing PD-1, Tim3 and Lag3 and 
lower proliferation by Ki67 compared to control mice as assessed 
by flow cytometry (Fig. 2c–f and Supplementary Fig. 5d). Because 
regulatory T-cells (Tregs) play a role in the TME and have been noted 
to be altered in obesity17, we also examined Tregs in the TME. We 
did not observe differences in the frequency of Tregs between DIO 
and control mice (Supplementary Fig. 5e), nor was there a differ-
ence in PD-L1 expression in the TME (Supplementary Fig. 5f). 
Interestingly, Cpt1a gene expression, a master regulator of fatty 
acid oxidation, was upregulated in both tumors and CD8+ T cells 
of DIO mice (Supplementary Fig. 5g). Cpt1a was recently identified 
as being upregulated in early-stage exhausted T cells after lympho-
cytic choriomeningitis virus 


infection and has been suggested as a 
potential driver of the metabolic changes leading to exhaustion18. 
We observed similar results with 4T1 breast carcinoma cells in DIO 
BALB/c mice in terms of tumor growth (Supplementary Fig. 5h–j) 
and TIL PD-1 expression (Fig. 2g) demonstrating these phenomena 
across strains and tumor types.
In addition to differences in the TME, the frequency of PD-1+ T 
cells was significantly increased systemically in the liver, spleen, and 
draining lymph nodes of tumor bearing DIO mice (Supplementary 
Fig. 6). This finding is in contrast to non-tumor-bearing 6-month-
old DIO mice, in which differences were observed only in the 
liver (Supplementary Fig. 1), indicating that tumor challenge 
accelerated the exhaustion phenotype in 6-month-old DIO mice 
inducing an exhausted systemic phenotype resembling 11- to 
12-month-old DIO mice. This coincided with a higher expression 
of transcription factor Eomes and a lower expression of T-bet on 
PD-1+ 
CD8+ T cells in liver, spleen, and draining lymph nodes of 
6-month-old tumor-bearing DIO mice compared to age-matched 
tumor-bearing controls (Supplementary Fig. 6c,e,g,h). Elevated 
expression of Eomes and decreased levels of T-bet are well-known 
markers of T cell exhaustion19–21. We observed the frequency of 
PD-1+ T cells in the visceral fat to be generally higher than that in 
other organs (Supplementary Fig. 6i-j), which is in agreement with 
recent reports22.
We next defined the molecular differences between sorted 
 
(> 
95% purity) CD8+ 
 memory T cells from the spleens and lymph 
nodes of B16-bearing control and DIO mice using transcriptomic 
analysis. Categorical clustering adjusted from previously described 
canonical T cell exhaustion and effector markers23 corroborated the 
results of our tumor T cell-phenotyping, demonstrating upregu-
lation of exhaustion-related transcripts and downregulation of 
effector-related transcripts in T cells from DIO mice (Fig. 2h). 
Differential profile analysis also demonstrated marked global tran-
scriptional differences of CD8+ 
 T cells from control versus DIO 
mice (Supplementary Fig. 7a). This functional categorical clus-
tering of markers was generated based on previously published 
data24. T cells from tumor-bearing DIO mice upregulated anergy-, 
senescence-, and TGF-β 
-associated genes as well as genes previ-
ously associated with obesity, diabetes and insulin-resistance22 
(Supplementary Fig.7a). Using ontology and network analysis, we 
further observed global, log-fold, differences in T cell gene expres-
sion from DIO versus control mice in genes involved in metabolism,

T cell activation, Toll-like receptor signaling, regulation of chemo-
taxis and protein folding similarly (Fig. 2i, Benjamini–-Hochberg 
false discovery rate < 0.05). Similar results were obtained using 
represented ontologies of either down-regulated (Fig. 2j) or up-
regulated genes (Supplementary Fig.7b) through network analysis. 
These results suggest that T cells from tumor-bearing DIO mice 
exhibit a transcriptomic profile that is markedly different from that 
of T cells from tumor-bearing control mice, findings consistent with 
increased exhaustion and inflammation.
Leptin levels are correlated with PD-1 expression. Obesity has been 
demonstrated to induce a meta-inflammatory state with increased 
pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα 
 and IL-6, as well as ele-
vated levels of glucose, insulin, fatty acids and leptin. Leptin, which

is characteristically present at high levels in obesity, has not been 
previously linked to PD-1 expression, but studies suggest that it can 
affect T cell function25–27. The RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis 
on T cells from B16-bearing control and DIO mice revealed differ-
ential expression of pathways involved in fat metabolism and T cell 
signaling and showed marked changes in the expression of genes 
previously described to be involved with leptin signaling28 includ-
ing several IFN-inducible GTPases29 (Supplementary Fig. 8a). In 
healthy human volunteers (Supplementary Table 1), we observed 
significantly increased serum leptin levels in obese donors (Fig. 3a), 
which correlated with PD-1 expression on CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3b and 
Supplementary Fig. 8b). Similarly, leptin levels were elevated in DIO 
mice, and this corresponded with an elevated frequency of PD-1 
on CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3c,d and Supplementary Fig. 1e,f). Using ad 
libitum (AL)-fed mice, which gain weight and visceral adipose tis-
sue as they age, and age-matched calorie restricted (CR) mice, we 
next determined whether limiting body weight and adipose tissue 
could minimize leptin levels and T cell exhaustion. CR mice had 
decreased visceral adiposity compared with AL mice, as measured 
by magnetic resonance imaging (Fig. 3e), and weighed significantly 
less and had lower leptin levels (Supplementary Fig. 8c,d). The 
reduced obesity and leptin levels in CR mice were accompanied by 
a significantly lower frequency of PD-1+ 
CD8+ 
 T cells in the liver 
and spleen as well as a lower frequency of Eomes+ 
PD-1+ 
CD8+ T 
cells (Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig. 8c–i) demonstrating that 
reduction of body fat resulted in lower leptin and T cell dysfunction 
with age. We next examined T cell phenotype in leptin-deficient 
ob/ob30 and leptin receptor (ObR)-deficient db/db mice31, both of 
which are obese due to lack of the satiety signal. As expected, db/
db mice weighed significantly more than age-matched wild type 
(WT) control mice (Supplementary Fig. 9a), but the frequency of 
CD8+ T cells expressing PD-1 in db/db mice was significantly lower 
than that in WT control mice (Fig. 3g). The ob/ob mice were weight 
matched to wild-type DIO mice and significantly heavier than WT 
control mice (Supplementary Fig. 9b). The frequency of CD8+ T 
cells expressing PD-1 from ob/ob mice trended lower than that of 
DIO mice with a similar weight but trended higher than that of 
control mice (Supplementary Fig. 9c,d). These results suggest that 
leptin is not required for PD-1 expression on CD8+ T cells but that 
in the setting of obesity intact leptin signaling contributes to the 
PD-1+ 
 phenotype. We next examined the fate of T cells from WT 
(ObR+ ) and db/db (ObR-) mice on regular diet subject to allo-
geneic activation by adoptive transfer into immunodeficient but 
H2-disparate (H2d) NSG mice (Supplementary Fig. 9e). Comparing 
the number of CD8+ 
 T cells originally transferred into NSG mice 
to the number of donor cells found in the spleen (Supplementary 
Fig. 9f) and liver (Supplementary Fig. 9g) at 13 days post transfer, 
we observed that WT cells expanded minimally in marked contrast 
with db/db T cells, which expanded robustly. This increased expan-
sion of db/db CD8+ T cells was associated with lower PD-1 expres-
sion (Fig. 3h,i). Comparing PD-1 frequency of transferred cells 
pre- and post-transfer, we found that both WT and db/db CD8+ T 
cells increased PD-1 expression upon transfer and chronic allogenic 
stimulation, but the extent of that increase was drastically more 
pronounced in WT CD8+ T cells, which showed a 40-fold increase 
in PD-1 expression (Supplementary Fig. 9h). These results suggest 
that T cells with intact leptin signaling are more susceptible to PD-1 
upregulation and proliferative dysfunction with chronic stimulation 
in vivo whereas leptin unresponsive T cells remain functional with 
limited PD-1 upregulation.
To further link leptin to PD-1 expression and T cell exhaustion 
we evaluated in vitro the effects of leptin on T cell activation directly. 
Mirroring the in vivo results with allogeneic stimulation, PD-1 
expression on CD8+ 
 T cells was increased upon stimulation with 
anti-CD3 (α 
CD3), and this upregulation was dramatically enhanced 
with addition of recombinant mouse leptin (rmleptin, Fig. 3j). This 
addition increased PD-1 expression correlated with upregulation 
of phospho-STAT3 (pSTAT3; Supplementary Fig. 10a,b), a major 
downstream mediator of leptin signaling, which is also known to 
induce PD-1 expression on T cells through distal regulatory ele-
ments that interact with the PD-1 gene promoter32. Importantly, 
the addition of a STAT3 inhibitor significantly decreased both the 
upregulation of pSTAT3 and PD-1 induced by stimulation and 
leptin (Supplementary Fig. 10a-b). Leptin can increase T cell acti-
vation33,34, and obesity can cause leptin resistance35,36. An alternate 
explanation for the T cell phenotype of DIO mice could be that 
leptin increases T cell activation, and in obesity, T cells develop 
leptin resistance. Therefore, we examined the induction of pSTAT3 
by leptin stimulation in T cells from control and DIO mice. There 
were no differences in the expression of pSTAT3 on CD8+ T cells 
from control and DIO mice (Supplementary Fig. 10c), indicating 
that CD8+ T cells in DIO mice are not resistant to leptin, in agree-
ment with published reports on DIO mice. Our studies with sorted 
human T cells in vitro revealed that mitogen-driven proliferation of 
memory T cells, but not naïve T cells, was inhibited by leptin, also 
in agreement with previous findings37 (Supplementary Fig. 10d). 
Collectively, our findings implicate leptin as a link between obesity 
and increased PD-1 expression and exhaustion on memory T cells.
We then examined the effect of leptin on T cell exhaustion in 
tumor-bearing models using leptin-deficient mice. We treated B16-
tumor-bearing ob/ob mice with rmleptin and examined tumor growth 
and immune activity (Supplementary Fig. 11a). Although ob/ob mice 
treated with exogenous rmleptin continuously lost weight, tumors 
in these mice grew faster (Supplementary Fig. 11b,c). Importantly, 
leptin treatment resulted in increased CD8+ T cell exhaustion in the 
tumor environment with significantly decreased IFNγ on PD-1+ 
CD8+ T cells (Fig. 4a), increased numbers of PD-1+ 
CD8+ T cells, 
decreased expression of Ki67, and significantly increased expression 
of Eomes at the mRNA level (Supplementary Fig. 11d-f). Exogenous 
rmleptin also significantly affected CD8 + T cells outside of the TME 
as demonstrated in the liver. Leptin upregulated PD-1 expression at 
the mRNA and protein levels (Supplementary Fig. 11g,h), as well as 
mRNA expression of HAVCR2 (Tim3) and Cpt1a (Supplementary 
Fig. 11i,j), resulting in diminished proliferation of PD-1 + CD8 + T 
cells (Fig. 4b). To examine the consequences of obesity and leptin 
signaling on the anti-tumor immune response, we adoptively trans-
ferred T cells from WT (ObR + ) or db/db mice into control or DIO 
immune-deficient C57BL/6 Rag2–/– mice, which lack T cells, bearing 
B16-F0 tumors (Fig. 4c,d and Supplementary Fig. 12a). Consistent 
with our previous data, tumor growth was accelerated in DIO 
Rag2–/– mice compared with control Rag2–/– mice (Supplementary 
Fig. 12b,c) after adoptive transfer of WT T cells. Importantly,


 
tumor growth kinetics were similar regardless of whether db/db T 
cells were transferred into control or DIO Rag2–/– C57BL/6 mice, 
whereas tumors grew faster in DIO Rag2–/– mice that received WT 
T cells compared with control Rag2–/– mice that received WT T cells 
(Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 12d). This finding suggests that the 
obese environment, with elevated leptin, impairs the anti-tumor 
responses of transferred WT CD8+ 
 T cells, but not leptin-resistant 
db/db CD8+ T cells. This is confirmed by TME immunophenotyp-
ing, which demonstrates significantly higher expression of PD-1 on 
WT adoptively transferred CD8 + T cells in DIO Rag2–/– mice ver-
sus db/db T cells in the DIO Rag2–/– mice or versus WT or db/db T 
cells in control Rag2–/– hosts (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Fig. 12e). 
Importantly, ex vivo analysis of TNFα and IFNγ production also 
demonstrated improved functionality of db/db TILs (compared with 
WT TILS) isolated from the TME of DIO Rag2–/– mice, whereas 
WT and db/db TILs from tumors in control Rag2–/– had equiva-
lent functionality (Fig. 4g–i and Supplementary Fig. 12f–h). These 
results indicate a role of leptin signaling in increasing PD-1 expres-
sion and promoting T cell exhaustion in tumor-bearing mice, which 
affects anti-tumor immunity.

and marked reduction in B16 tumor burden and a significant 
improvement in survival in DIO mice (Fig. 5a,b and Supplementary 
Fig. 13b,c). Similar results were also observed in 3LL-tumor-
bearing DIO mice (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 13d,e). Of 
note, in agreement with our other models demonstrating acceler-
ated tumor growth in obese models, 3LL tumors also grew faster 
in DIO mice. These results demonstrate that in models in which 
α 
PD-1 monotherapy has limited effect (B16)38 or where there is 
some susceptibility to monotherapy (3LL)39, DIO mice displayed 
significantly greater therapeutic efficacy than control recipients. 
The improved responsiveness in DIO mice was associated with a 
significant increase in the total number of tumor-infiltrating T cells 
and increased frequency of CD8+ 
 T cells in the TME (Fig. 5d,e and 
Supplementary Fig. 13f,g), as well as an increased CD8-to-CD4 T 
cell ratio (Supplementary Fig. 13h) in response to therapy. In DIO 
mice, α 
PD-1 therapy also reduced the frequency of PD-1 + T cells 
in the TME (Supplementary Fig. 13i,j). Similarly, ex vivo func-
tional assessment of splenic CD8+ T cells from α 
PD-1-treated 
tumor-bearing DIO mice demonstrated significantly increased 
TNFα and IFNγ production on CD8+ T cells, compared with con-
trols (Supplementary Fig. 14a,b). Overall, α

in DIO mice. Similar anti-tumor effects were also observed in a 
melanoma metastasis model (B16-F10, Supplementary Fig. 14c). 
Importantly, α 
PD-1 treatment significantly inhibited metastases in 
B16-bearing DIO mice, but not in control mice (Fig. 5f). Further 
examination of the effects of α 
PD-1 in DIO mice revealed signifi-
cant inhibition of both visceral and lung metastases (Fig. 5g–j). 
Importantly, despite the risks of severe or lethal toxicities after sys-
temic immune-stimulatory therapies in obese mice40, adverse events 
were not observed after α 
PD-1 checkpoint blockade (Supplementary 
Fig. 14d–g), thus implying an uncoupling of heightened treatment 
response and risk of toxicity in the setting of obesity that may be 
contingent on the type of immunotherapy applied.
Impact of obesity on PD-1 expression and effects of checkpoint 
blockade in obese cancer patients. Because significant anti-tumor 
effects were observed with α 
PD-1 therapy in obese mouse mod-
els, we examined T cell phenotypes in the TME of obese human 
cancer patients. In a large cohort of 152 human colorectal cancers, 
we observed significantly fewer tumor-infiltrating-T cells in obese 
patients (Fig. 6a, b). Because patients with CRC have a poor response 
rate to checkpoint blockade, we also examined a more responsive 
tumor type: melanoma. In a cohort of 251 patients with melanoma 
with annotated clinical data from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) 
a 1.57-fold (P = 
 0.019) increase in mean PD-1 expression was noted 
in tumors of obese patients (BMI ≥ 30) (data not shown). Among

2.2-fold increase in TBX21 (T-bet) (Fig. 6g, P = 9.0 × 10−4), and 
1.79-fold increase in EOMES (Fig. 6h, P = 6.9 × 10−3). These results 
generally mirrored the TME phenotype in DIO mouse tumors, with 
no change in FOXP3, leptin receptor, CTLA-4 and CD274 (PD-
L1) expression (Supplementary Fig. 15a–d). Most importantly, we 
observed a striking improvement in the clinical outcomes of obese 
(BMI ≥ 30) versus non-obese (BMI < 
 30) patients, in a cohort of 250 
human patients treated with α 
PD-(L)1 checkpoint blockade for a 
variety of cancers (Supplementary Table 2). There was a statistically 
significant improvement in progression-free survival (median: 237 
versus 141 days, P = 0.0034) and overall survival (median: 523 ver-
sus 361 days, P = 0.0492) in obese patients (Fig. 6i,j). As in obese 
mice, no increases in immune-related adverse effects were observed 
in obese patients (Supplementary Table 2). Using a Cox propor-
tional hazards model to adjust for ECOG performance status, line of 
treatment, age, sex and cancer type, BMI category was still signifi-
cantly associated with better progression-free survival (HR = 0.61, 
95% CI = 0.42–0.89, P = 0.01) and overall survival after α 
PD-(L)1 
therapy (HR = 0.594, 95% CI = 0.35–0.99, P = 0.048).
Discussion
In this report, we demonstrate for the first time, across multiple spe-
cies and tumor models, that obesity increases T cell aging result-
ing in higher PD-1 expression and dysfunction, which is driven, at 
least in part, by leptin signaling. We also observed increased tumor 
progression in the setting of obesity, and this was probably due to 
immunosuppression as well as direct (metabolic and hormonal41) 
effects. However, the PD-1-mediated T cell dysfunction in obesity 
remarkably left tumors markedly more responsive to checkpoint 
blockade. Importantly, these preclinical findings are corroborated 
by clinical data demonstrating significantly improved outcomes in 
obese cancer patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.
Our findings validate and provide a mechanism for a recent 
report in obese melanoma patients showing improved outcomes 
with immunotherapy14. In that study, the effect was limited to male 
melanoma patients, whereas our clinical data extend across cancer 
types and demonstrates a positive effect even when controlling for 
sex. Although our study focuses on PD-1-mediated T cell dysfunc-
tion induced by obesity, sex and other factors such as age, genetics, 
metabolic dysregulation, gut microbiome, dietary differences and 
the duration of obesity probably confound the effects of obesity on 
the immune system and warrant further study. Age in particular is 
known to increase the memory pool of T cells and may be a key 
confounder particularly in specific-pathogen-free laboratory mice, 
which experience limited exposure to immune challenges. In our 
studies 6-month-old DIO mice did not display the heightened phe-
notypic exhaustion seen in 11-month-old DIO mice, unless chal-
lenged with a tumor. This finding is consistent with the concept that 
obesity results in an immune aging effect, termed inflammaging12, 
which is accentuated by immune challenge. Thus, age, sex, expo-
sure to immune challenge and obesity may all play critical roles in 
shaping immune responses. Furthermore, obesity probably oper-
ates via multiple pathways aside from the PD-(L)1 axis to induce 
T cell dysfunction and promote tumor growth, and these phenom-
ena are likely also influenced by diet. We observed elevated Cpt1a 
expression, a master regulator of fatty acid oxidation and driver of 
metabolic changes leading to exhaustion18. Other factors associated 
with obesity, such as free fatty acids, insulin/IGF1, and proinflam-
matory cytokines such as TNF and IL6, all are likely to contribute to 
this phenotype outside of body fat. As a result, it will be important 
to ascertain the effects of different diets and duration of exposure 
needed to observe possible immune-altering effects.
In our study, tumor-bearing DIO mice showed higher expres-
sion of Eomes than T-bet, which supports an exhausted CD8+ T 
cell profile4,42. Although some studies suggest that T-bethi but not 
Eomeshi exhausted T cells respond better to PD-1 blockade4, it has 
been demonstrated that blocking the PD-(L)1 axis can reinvigorate 
PD-1hiT-betloEomes+ 
CD8+ T cells43.
We focused on leptin as a mechanism of obesity-induced T cell 
dysfunction, given that STAT3, a major downstream transcription 
factor of the leptin receptor44,45, has known binding sites in the 
promoter region of PD-146,47 and has been implicated in driving 
expression of PD-1 in human and murine cancers48. However, it is 
important to recognize that these molecules have broad pleiotropic 
effects, and other pathways are probably implicated. This notion 
was demonstrated by the effects of administering leptin to ob/ob 
mice, where significant metabolic effects also occurred.
While leptin has been well documented to impact T cells, par-
ticularly Tregs, the literature also suggests that leptin increases T 
cell activation26,34, which may be explained by the opposing effects 
of leptin on naïve versus memory T cell populations as previously 
reported37. PD-1 plays critical roles both in early T cell activation as 
well as in later chronic stimulation, where the exhaustion phenotype 
predominates. Thus, differences between our findings and others 
are likely to be explained by the T cell populations examined and 
the time points assessed. The impact of leptin and obesity on other 
immune cells is also likely to be important, given the recent report 
linking leptin in tumor-bearing DIO mice with PD-L1 expression 
in myeloid-derived suppressor cells49. Our results also suggest that 
targeting the leptin receptor on activated T cells or CAR T cells in 
immunotherapy may be of use to augment T cell function, particu-
larly in high-leptin circumstances.
Overall, our data suggest that obesity-associated inflammag-
ing results in increased T cell aging and induction of normal sup-
pressive pathways to counter this chronic inflammatory state. In 
obesity, PD-1-mediated immune suppression may be a mecha-
nism to protect against possible autoreactive or hyperactive T 
cell responses induced by chronic inflammation. Importantly, 
the linkage of obesity and leptin to PD-1 and T cell dysfunction 
in cancer progression appears remarkably robust in both mouse 
and human studies. It remains to be determined whether obesity 
increases PD-1+ CD8 T cells in a broad range of human cancers 
and whether this mechanism also contributes to the increased 
incidence of cancer in obese patients. Furthermore, it remains 
to be delineated clinically whether the environment in the obese 
state results in greater T cell activation and function once check-
point blockade is applied. It is unclear if obesity may impact the 
survival of cancer patients by other non-immune factors as well. 
In that regard, obesity should not necessarily be regarded as a pos-
itive prognostic factor in cancer but rather as a potential mediator 
of immune dysfunction and tumor progression that can be suc-
cessfully reversed by PD-(L)1 checkpoint inhibition resulting in 
heightened efficacy.

Reporting Summary linked to this article.
Mice. Mice were housed in AAALAC-accredited animal facilities at UC Davis 
under specific-pathogen-free conditions. Protocols were approved by UC Davis 
IACUC and studies complied with ethical regulations and humane endpoints. Male 
and female C57BL/6NTac, female BALB/cAnNTac and male B6.129S6-Rag2tm1Fwa 
N12 (Rag2–/–) mice were purchased from Taconic Farms at 4 weeks of age. DDIO 
and control mice were generated by feeding mice with an open-source purified 
diet consisting of either 60% fat or 10% fat (D12492 & D12450J, Research Diets, 
Inc), respectively, starting when the mice were 6 weeks old. Four- to eight-week-old 
male B6.Cg-Lepob/J (ob/ob) mice and female B6.BKS(D)-Leprdb/J (B6 db/db) and 
WT C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. ob/ob mice were used 
when they were 3–5 months old and equivalent in weight to 9-month-old DIO 
mice. Six- to nine-month-old BKS.Cg-Dock7m+ 
/+ 
Leprdb/J (BSK db/db) were kind 
gifts from R. R. Isseroff. The female NSG mice (4–5 months old) were kind gifts 
from J. 


Nolta. 19-month-old AL and calorie restricted (CR) C57BL/6 mice were 
obtained from the National Institute on Aging and were fed NIH31 regular chow 
with a 40% calorie restriction regimen previously published40.
Leptin and glucose measurements. Leptin concentrations of human plasma were 
measured using a sandwich ELISA kit from MilliporeSigma. Mouse serum leptin 
was measured using an electrochemiluminescent assay from Meso Scale Discovery. 
Mouse glucose was measured using an enzymatic assay from Fisher Diagnostics.
Tumor cell line and treatment. The murine melanoma cell lines B16-F0 
(CRL6322™) and B16-F10 (CRL-6475™), Lewis lung carcinoma (3LL, CRL-1642™), 
and breast cancer 4T1 (CRL-2539™) were obtained from the American Type 
Culture Collection. C57BL/6 mice were injected subcutaneously in the right 
flank with 1 × 106 B16-F0 or 3LL tumor cells in 100 μ 
L PBS. BALB/c mice were 
injected subcutaneously in the right mammary pad with 2 × 105 4T1 tumor cells 
in 100 μ 
L PBS. Tumor growth was monitored daily and measured every 2–3 d. 
Tumor volume was determined as length (mm) × width2 (mm) × 0.5. C57BL/6 
tumor-bearing mice were treated intraperitoneally with 500 μ 
g α 
PD-1 monoclonal 
antibody (B16: clone 29 F.1A12; 3LL: clone J43, BioXCell) in 200 μ 
L PBS on day 
6, and 250 μ 
g α 
PD-1 monoclonal antibody on days 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 post 
tumor inoculation. Control mice received rat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch 
Laboratories, Inc.). For the B16-F10 studies, 1 × 105 tumor cells were intravenously 
injected into C57BL/6 mice. Mice were treated intraperitoneally with 500 μ 
g α 
PD-1 monoclonal antibody (B16: clone 29 F.1A12) in 200 μ 
L PBS on day − 
1, and 
250 μ 
g α 
PD-1 monoclonal antibody on days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 post tumor inoculation 
(d.p.i.). ob/ob mice were subcutaneously injected with 1 × 106 B16-F0 in 100 μ 
L 
PBS in the right flank. 1 µ 
g/g recombinant mouse leptin (rmleptin, R&D Systems, 
Minneapolis, MN) was injected intraperitoneally twice per day from d.p.i. − 
3 to 14.
Adoptive transfer of cells into mice. 2 × 107 cells from either C57BL/6 WT or BSK 
db/db mice isolated from spleens and lymph nodes were adoptively transferred into 
NSG mice. Immune parameters of B6 WT or BSK db/db T cells in the recipient 
of NSG mice were analyzed on day 13 post-transfer. 1 × 106 B16-F0 cells were 
subcutaneously inoculated in the right flank of 5–month-old male DIO and control 
Rag2–/– mice. The MagniSort Mouse T-cell Enrichment Kit (ThermoFisher) was 
used to enrich T cells from spleens and lymph nodes of B6 WT or BSK db/db 
mice. 2 × 106 enriched T cells from either B6 WT or db/db mice were adoptively 
transferred into B16-F0-bearing control and DIO Rag2–/– mice at 6 d.p.i. Immune 
parameters of B6 WT or db/db T cells in the recipient of B16-F0-bearing control 
and DIO Rag2–/– mice were analyzed on day 16 post-transfer.
Anti-CD40/IL-2 immunotherapy. The agonistic anti-mouse CD40 antibody (α 
CD40, clone FGK115B3) was generated via ascites production in our laboratory 
and 6- to 8-month-old male DIO and control B16-F0-bearing mice were 
treated with α 
CD40 and recombinant human IL-2 (rhIL-2, TECIN Teceleukin) 
as previously described40,50. In brief, α 
CD40 (40 μ 
g/dose in 200 μ 
L PBS) was 
administered daily for a total of 5 consecutive days (d.p.i. 6–10) and rhIL-2 (105 IU/
dose) was administered twice on d.p.i. 7 and 9. B16F0-bearing mice treated with 
either α 
CD40/rhIL-2 or anti-PD-1 were bled on day 8. Control mice received rat 
IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) and PBS.
Mouse flow cytometry. Single cell suspensions were prepared from livers, tumors, 
spleens, lung and draining lymph nodes. Cells were incubated with Fc block (anti-
CD16/32 clone 93, BioLegend) and stained with the fluorochrome-conjugated 
monoclonal antibodies listed below. FMOs were used as negative staining 
controls to set gates. For Intracellular staining of TNFα 
 and IFNγ 
, the Cytofix/
CytopermTM kit (BD Biosciences) was used. 1 × 106 single cells from spleen, liver, 
and tumors were stimulated with 1 µ 
g/mL anti-mouse CD3 antibody coated wells 
(clone 145-2C11) in RF10 Complete Medium for 6 h total at 37 °C with 4 µ 
L/6 mL 
GolgiStop (BD Biosciences) and 1 µ 
L/mL GolgiPlug (BD Biosciences) for the last 
4 h before surface staining. For intracellular staining of Ki67, FoxP3, T-bet and 
Eomes, the FoxP3/Transcription Factor Staining kit (ThermoFisher) was used. 
Q10
2 × 105 cells from liver and spleen were stimulated with 1 µ 
g/mL Concanavalin 
A (ConA, MilliporeSigma) for 48 h at 37 °C before surface staining. For pSTAT3 
staining, 2–5 × 105 single cells from spleen were stimulated by 100 ng/ml anti-
mouse CD3 antibody coated wells (clone 145–2C11) with or without 12 μ 
M 
STAT3 inhibitor cryptotanshinone (EMD Millipore, CAS# 35825-57-1) for 1 h at 
37 °C prior to addition of 100 ng/mL or 1000 ng/mL recombinant mouse leptin 
(rmleptin, Gibco LifeTechnologies). Intracellular pSTAT3 was stained based on the 
manufacturer’s two-step protocol for fixation/methanol (IC Fixation Buffer, cat# 
00-8222, ThermoFisher Scientific). Zombie Red viability dye and the following 
fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies were purchased from BioLegend: 
PB-anti-CD45 (30-F11), PB-anti-CD44 (IM7), APC-Cy7-anti-CD45 (30-F11), 
BV711-anti-CD4 (RM4–5), BV785-anti-CD3 (17A2), BV605-anti-CD8a (53–6.7), 
PE-Cy7-anti-TNFα 
 (MP6-XT22), Alexa Fluor 700-anti-Ki67 (16A8), Alexa Fluor 
647-anti-T-bet (4B10); From ThermoFisher: FITC-anti-PD-1 (RMP1–30), FITC-
anti-FoxP3 (FJK-16s), PE-eFluor 610-anti-Eomes (Dan11mag), PE-anti-Tim3 
(RMT3–23), PerCP-eFluor 710-anti-Lag3 (eBioC9B7W), PE-anti-PD-L1 (MIH5), 
PE-Cy7-anti-CD62L (MEL-14), APC-anti-pSTAT3 (Tyr705) (LUVNKLA); and 
from BD Biosciences: APC-Cy7-anti-IFNγ 
 (XMG1.2). Details of antibodies 
including dilutions used and validation can be found in Supplementary Table 3. 
Flow cytometry data were acquired on an LSR Fortessa flow cytometer (BD 
Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star).
Mouse tumor staining. For histological staining, B16-F0 tumors from DIO or 
lean control mice were fixed in 10% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. 
Multiple 4 μ 
m sections were cut for Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining Slides 
were prepared and stained at Histology Consultation Services, Inc. (Everson, WA). 
H&E slides of tumor samples were reviewed by a dermatologist/pathologist (R. R. 
Isseroff). Images were captured by a BZ-9000 BioRevo Fluorescence Microscope 
equipped with 10× 
 numerical aperture objective lens (KEYENCE, Canada).
Mouse lung whole-mount preparation. Lungs from B16-F10-bearing mice were 
collected, separated into five lobes and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. 
Lung tissue was transferred to 70% alcohol for 2 h then to 100% alcohol for another 
2 h. Lungs were then dehydrated using three changes of xylene (30 min, 1 h, 1 h), 
followed by processing through a graded series of alcohol. After rinsing in running 
tap water for 30 min, the tissues were stained with hematoxylin for 2 min. Lungs 
were destained in a 1% HCl solution for 15 min, then placed under running tap 
water for 30 min, 70% alcohol for 1 h, 100% alcohol for 1 h, and finally xylene for 
1 h. Whole mounts were then submerged in methyl salicylate for storage.
18F-FDG-PET scanning image analysis. Six-month-old control and DIO mice 
bearing B16-F0 tumors were analyzed for uptake of FDG by PET-CT image. Mice 
were anesthetized using vaporized isoflurane and oxygen. The radiotracer 18F-
FDG (7.92 ± 0.45 MBq) was administered via lateral tail vein injection. At 30 min 
post radiotracer injection, mice were placed in a prone position on the animal 
bed of a small-animal PET imaging system (Inveon DPET, Siemens Preclinical 
Solutions), and scanned. PET list mode data were acquired for 30 min. PET images 
were reconstructed using the 3D MAP reconstruction with a single hyperbolic 
prior (SP-MAP) provided by the vendor. After the PET scan, the animal bed was 
moved to an adjacent CT scanner (Inveon CT, Siemens Preclinical Solutions, 
Siemens Healthcare Molecular Imaging) for anatomical image acquisition. Animal 
respiration was visually monitored throughout both scans. Heat lamps were used to 
maintain consistent temperature. The PET and CT images were co-registered and 
analyzed using PMOD v3.8 software (PMOD Technologies). To determine tumor 
activity based on 18F-FDG uptake in individual lesions, volumes of interest were 
drawn at sites of the tumors on overlay images, and the maximum standardized 
uptake value (SUVmax) was determined for each volume of interest.
MRI data acquisition and image analysis. Mice were anesthetized with 
isofluorane and oxygen. They were scanned on the Biospec 70/30 7.0 Tesla small-
animal MRI system (Bruker Biospin Inc) using a 60 mm quadrature transmitter/
receiver coil for whole body imaging. The scanning protocol consisted of the multi-
slice with multi-echo (MSME) spin-echo sequence with a single echo and with 
respiratory gating to minimize breathing artifacts. Scan parameters were: TE 7.062, 
TR 775, conducted with and without chemical-selective fat suppression. Slice 
images were obtained in the coronal direction to improve spatial resolution while 
keeping scan time and TR at minimums. The in-plane matrix was 200 × 267 with 
a resolution of 0.3 × 0.3 mm. Forty-four slices were acquired with a slice thickness 
of 0.6 mm. Field of view was 6 × 8 × 2.64 cm. Difference images were generated 
by subtracting the fat-suppressed images from the non-fat-suppressed images, to 
identify the 3D distribution of fat deposits. Physiological monitoring (temperature 
and respiration) was used during the entire scan to ensure consistency and animal 
physiological stability.
RNA extraction, sequencing, analysis and PCR. Total RNA was extracted from 
sorted CD44+ 
CD8+ T cells from spleen and lymph nodes using RNeasy plus 
mini kit (Qiagen). RNA concentrations were quantified using a Qubit fluorometer 
and RNA integrity was assessed using TapeStation 2200 (Agilent). Samples with 
an RNA integrity number ≥ 
9 were used for this study. After QC procedures,

mRNA was submitted to Novogene for strand-specific library preparation and 
sequenced on a HiSeq 2500 instrument (150 pair-end sequencing). Data analysis 
was performed by the UC Davis Bioinformatics core using expHTS to trim low 
quality sequences and adapter contamination, and to remove PCR duplicates from 
raw reads. Trimmed reads for each sample were aligned to the GRCm38 mouse 
genome with GENCODE vM10 annotation, using STAR v. 2.5.2b aligner51, which 
also generated raw counts per gene, which were the input to the statistical analysis. 
The Bioconductor package edgeR was used for read normalization52. The most 
significant pathways by functional interpretation of candidate gene lists were input 
and analyzed using G:Profiler by the g:GOST comprehensive method (P < 0.05). 
Network analysis was completed on up- and down-regulated genes in both 
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from enriched gene sets using GeneMANIA53.
RNA was extracted from tumor and liver tissue using a Qiagen RNeasy 
Lipid Tissue Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s 
protocol with optional on column DNase 


(Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA was 
quantified using Qubit 4 (ThermoFisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY) RNA 
Broad range and 300 ng RNA was converted to cDNA using Bio-Rad iScrpt 
Reverse Transcription Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) following standard 
protocols. qPCR was performed on a Bio-Rad CFX384 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, 
CA) with Bio-Rad SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, 
Hercules, CA) in 10 µ

(PPM02946E) (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and β 
-actin (PPM02945B) (Qiagen, 
Valencia, CA) as reference genes.
Non-human primate studies. This study was performed at the California National 
Primate Research Center (CNPRC) under strict compliance with the NIH Guide 
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The CNPRC, which is one of seven 
centers supported by the National Institutes of Health, Office of the Director 
(NIH/OD), is accredited by AAALAC. The animal protocol was approved by 
UC Davis IACUC. Peripheral blood samples were obtained from adult (6- to 10-
year old) male lean (7–9 kg) and obese (14.5–20 kg) rhesus macaques (Macaca 
mulatta). PBMCs were isolated by means of density centrifugation. Staining for 
flow cytometry was done using aqua viability dye (Invitrogen) and fluorochrome-
conjugated antibodies against the following markers purchased from BioLegend: 
PE-anti-PD-1 (EH12.2H7) and BD Biosciences: PB-anti-CD3 (SP34-2), BV605-
anti-CD4 (L200), AF700-anti-CD8 (RPA-T8), APC-anti-CD95 (DX2), and APC-
H7-anti-CD28 (CD28.2)). Details of antibodies, including dilutions used and 
validation can be found in Supplementary Table 3. For the proliferation assay, 
1 × 106 PBMCs were cultured for 4 d in an anti-CD3ε 
-coated 96-well round bottom 
plate (10 µ 
g/mL, 50 µ 
L/well 2 h incubation at 37 °C, followed by two washes with 
PBS), clone SP34, BD Biosciences). Cells were stained with the same surface 
marker antibody panel listed above and intracellular staining was performed with 
fixation/permeabilization solutions (BD Biosciences) to stain for Ki67 (clone B56 
on AF488, BD Biosciences).
Human blood samples. Human blood collection study was approved by the IRB 
at the University of California at Davis. Human studies complied with all ethical 
regulations. Study participants were healthy female donors aged 27–56 years with 
no history of cancer, hypersensitivity, hyperglycemia and/or hyperinsulinemia. 
BMI for each participant was calculated as mass (kg)/height (m) ^2. Non-obese 
BMI was defined as < 
30 and obesity was defined as BMI ≥ 
30. PBMCs were 
isolated from peripheral blood samples of each donor using Ficoll-Paque density 
centrifugation. Cells were stained with fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal 
antibodies listed below in staining buffer with 1% human serum. Isotype-matched 
rat or mouse IgG monoclonal antibodies were used as negative staining controls 
Zombie Red viability dye and the following fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal 
antibodies were purchased from BioLegend: BV605-anti-CD8a (RPA-T8), BV711-
anti-CD4 (OKT4), PE-anti-PD-1 (EH12.2H7), AF700-anti-CD45RA (HI100); 
from BD: FITC-anti-CD62L (SK11), BV421-anti-CD3 (HIT3a), BV421-anti-
CD45RO (UCHL1); and from ThermoFisher: APC-anti-Ki67 (20Raj1).
Naïve (CD3+CD45RA+CD45RO−) versus effector/memory 
(CD3+CD45RA−CD45RO+) T cells were isolated using a Beckman Coulter Astrios 
flow cytometric sorter. 2 × 105 cells were plated in each well and stimulated with 
2.5 µ 
g/mL ConA with or without the addition of 10 nM recombinant human leptin 
(rhleptin, Gibco LifeTechnologies) for 48 h at 37 °C in a 96-well flat-bottom plate. 
Cell were counted using an automated cell counter (Bio-Rad, TC20).
Q11
Human CD3 tissue staining. A serially collected cohort of patients with 152 
colorectal cancer seen in the Yale Surgical Pathology suite was previously arranged 
into a tissue microarray (TMA) called YTMA 226 with annotated clinical data. 
This TMA was stained using validated and standardized multiplexed QIF panels 
as previously described54. We measured the levels of PD-1 (clone EH33, CST), 
CD3 (polyclonal, DAKO), and nuclear DAPI staining. Two TMA histospots were 
evaluated for each case and the average was obtained. Cases that have < 
5% tumor 
tissue in a histospot were excluded from the analysis. Quantitative measurement of 
the fluorescence signal was performed using the AQUA method of QIF. Differences 
in QIF between samples from non-obese (BMI < 30) and obese (BMI ≥ 30) patients 
were compared using a two-tailed Student’s t-test.
TCGA analysis. TCGA-SKCM melanoma tumor mRNA expression data from 251 
cases with clinical data including BMI were downloaded with the TCGAbiolinks55 
R package from the GDC legacy archive (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/legacy-
archive/). Figures represent 126 patients (> 
60 years old). Differential expression 
analysis was carried out using the DESeq256 bioconductor R package (https://
www.R-project.org/).
Human PD-(L)1 therapy clinical data. Using an IRB approved protocol, we 
reviewed all cancer patients, age 18 years or older, treated with anti PD-1 and 
PD-L1 therapy at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center between 
January 2014 and January 2018 (n = 250). Simple descriptive statistics were 
created for all covariates (mean, SD for continuous covariates and n (%) for 
categorical variables) overall and by BMI group. Kaplan–Meier Analysis was 
performed to assess how BMI category (< 
30 versus ≥ 
30) related to OS and 
PFS. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the association of 
BMI category with OS and PFS adjusted for ECOG performance status, line of 
treatment, age, sex, and cancer type, checking for interactions between BMI 
category

and other covariates57.
Statistics. Graphs were made and statistical analyses were performed using 
Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc.). Data were expressed as mean ± s.e.m. 
For analysis of three or more groups, analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were 
performed with a Bonferroni or Tukey post-hoc test, when appropriate. Analysis 
of differences between two normally distributed test groups was performed using 
the Student’s t-test. P values were considered statistically significant if P < 0.05. 
Statistical outliers were identified using Grubb’s test. Statistical differences in 
survival were determined by log rank (Mantel–Cox) analysis.
