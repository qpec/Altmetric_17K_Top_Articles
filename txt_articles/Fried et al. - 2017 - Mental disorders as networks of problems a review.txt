Abstract
Purpose The network perspective on psychopathology
understands mental disorders as complex networks of
interacting symptoms. Despite its recent debut, with con-
ceptual foundations in 2008 and empirical foundations in
2010, the framework has received considerable attention
and recognition in the last years.
Methods This paper provides a review of all empirical
network studies published between 2010 and 2016 and
discusses them according to three main themes: comor-
bidity, prediction, and clinical intervention.
Results Pertaining to comorbidity, the network approach
provides a powerful new framework to explain why certain
disorders may co-occur more often than others. For pre-
diction, studies have consistently found that symptom
networks of people with mental disorders show different
characteristics than that of healthy individuals, and pre-
liminary evidence suggests that networks of healthy people
show early warning signals before shifting into disordered
states. For intervention, centrality—a metric that measures
how connected and clinically relevant a symptom is in a
network—is
the
most
commonly
studied
topic,
and
numerous studies have suggested that targeting the most
central symptoms may offer novel therapeutic strategies.
Conclusions We sketch future directions for the network
approach pertaining to both clinical and methodological
research, and conclude that network analysis has yielded
important insights and may provide an important inroad
towards personalized medicine by investigating the net-
work structures of individual patients.

Introduction
In the last years, a growing number of publications have
studied mental disorders, such as Major Depressive
Disorder (MDD), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD),
and psychosis as networks of interacting symptoms.
Although this scientific discipline is young, with its con-
ceptual roots in 2008 [1] and its empirical foundations in
2010 [2], it is fast-moving and has gained considerable
recognition. The big step forward within the last years has
been the development of statistical models that allow for
the estimation of empirical psychopathology networks. The
present paper aims to provide a review of the contemporary
empirical literature on this network conceptualization of
psychopathology. For more information on the methodol-
ogy behind these empirical papers—network psychomet-
rics—we refer the interested reader elsewhere [3–9].
According to the network perspective on psychopathol-
ogy, a mental disorder can be viewed as a system of inter-
acting symptoms. From this perspective, the causal interplay

 between symptoms constitutes mental disorders [2, 10, 11].
Taking Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) as an example,
depressed patients often experience symptoms, such as
sadness, anhedonia, fatigue, insomnia, concentration prob-
lems, and suicidal ideation [12], and it is easy to envision
causal relationships among these problems, for instance,
fatigue ? insomnia ? concentration problems, or sadness
? anhedonia ? suicidal ideation. Figure 1a shows an
example of such a directed network for a hypothetical
depressed patient Susan. Figure 1b, on the other hand,
depicts an undirected network estimated in a group of people
in cross-sectional data (the syntax to reproduce all figures is
available in the Supplementary Materials).
The remainder of the paper is organized into four sec-
tions. First, we review publications that aim to explain the
comorbidity rates among mental disorders using the net-
work approach. Second, we summarize network studies
that have been conducted with the aim of predicting the
course of disorders, and to identify indicators of a worse
prognosis. Third, we discuss what insights network studies
have yielded for clinical intervention. Finally, we discuss
implications for future clinical practice and how the net-
work perspective can move forward.
Comorbidity
The presence of multiple disorders at the same time is
extremely common in the realm of psychopathology [13].
Comorbidity has received considerable attention in the
clinical literature, because patients diagnosed with multiple
disorders have poorer prognosis, worse treatment out-
comes, and higher suicide rates [14, 15].
Comorbidity from a network perspective
Traditionally, comorbid mental disorders are understood as
different
disorders,
while
the
network
approach
hypothesizes that they may co-occur due to mutual inter-
actions among symptoms [2]. Comorbidity, in that view,
arises when there are symptoms that bridge two disorders.
These so-called bridge symptoms can spread activation
from one disorder to the other. Figure 2 represents such a
case where a person first develops disorder X (in response
to an environmental stressor E), then the bridge symptoms
B, and finally disorder Y. X could be MDD, Y could be
Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) that often occurs
together with MDD, and the bridge symptoms B could be
sleep problems, fatigue, concentration problems, or psy-
chomotor agitation that are part of both MDD and GAD
DSM-5 criteria [12].
Note that there are numerous other possibilities from a
network perspective to explain the comorbidity between X
and Y: activation may go the other way around (Y ? B ?
X), or a person could also develop the bridge symptoms B
first, and then at the same time both X and Y.
Comorbidity in empirical data
Several cross-sectional studies have investigated how
symptoms are related across disorders. In the first empirical
network study on the subject, Cramer et al. [2] found that
the empirical network structure of MDD and GAD symp-
toms in a general population sample was entangled. A
recent paper replicated these findings in a large clinical
sample, also concluding that MDD and GAD symptoms are
strongly interconnected [16]. Another team of researchers
studied the comorbidity of MDD and complicated grief
[17], and showed that symptoms form two distinct clusters
that are connected through the symptoms loneliness,
emotional pain, and emotional numbing. The authors sug-
gested that emotional pain may be a promising target for
psychotherapeutic interventions.
Boschloo et al. [18] used a network analysis in a data set
with over 34,000 patients interviewed on 120 symptoms of
12 major DSM-IV disorders. In the resulting network, no

 sharp boundaries were found between the 12 disorders (i.e.,
symptoms of different diagnoses were related to each other
across diagnoses), and there was substantial symptom
overlap across diagnoses. The authors repeated this anal-
ysis in a community sample of 2175 preadolescents with 95
emotional and behavioral problems, with similar results
[19].
Comorbidity research from a network perspective has
also generated new hypotheses for Autism Spectrum
Disorder
(ASD)
and
Obsessive–Compulsive
Disorder
(OCD), both of which share repetitive behaviors. A study
in a clinical sample of 213 children revealed that repetitive
behaviors seem to connect ASD and OCD symptom clus-
ters, and the authors also found evidence that repetitive
behaviors may differ somewhat in people with ASD and
people with OCD [20].
One implication of the network view on comorbidity is
that diagnoses may co-occur as a function of their number
of shared symptoms. As described above, MDD and GAD
should have relatively high comorbidities, whereas disor-
ders that share no symptoms, such as schizophrenia and
specific phobias, should rarely co-occur because of the lack
of bridge symptoms that can transport information. Inter-
estingly, this implication does not derive from the tradi-
tional conceptualization of mental disorders as medical
conditions, where disorders cause their symptoms [21, 22].
The fact that diagnoses for HIV, cancer, and tuberculosis
may share more or less symptoms should not impact
strongly on their rates of comorbidity, seeing that they have
independent common causes. One study tested that pre-
diction and measured how related the networks of different
mental disorders are. They found that empirical comor-
bidity rates were related to distances between disorders in
an analysis of symptom overlap in the DSM [23].1 This
means that when two disorders, such as MDD and Dys-
thymia, share multiple symptoms, the distance between
these disorders in the DSM network is small and one can
easily travel from one disorder to the other.2
To conclude, zooming in on disorders at symptom level
[25, 26], as the network perspective does, reveals how
comorbidity might come about. Currently, this issue is
empirically unresolved, and the way comorbidity arises
may very well be different for different people with the
same comorbid diagnoses and different for different types
of comorbid diagnoses.
Prediction
While manypeople experience single symptoms, only part of
them develop a mental disorder. One of the most important
areas of clinical research is thus the prediction of psy-
chopathology onset, which would allow clinicians earlier
interventions. The network literature on prediction has, thus
far, focused on two aspects: (1) so-called early warning
signals that may indicate the upcoming onset of psy-
chopathology for a specific patient and (2) characteristics of
group-level networks that may help predict the future course
of psychopathology. It is of note that the work on prediction
has mostly investigated emotion dynamics [27]—the tem-
poral associations between emotions, such as sadness, anger,
fear, or being content—while little research has been con-
ducted on the dynamics among a broader set of problems or
symptoms like insomnia, fatigue, and concentration prob-
lems. Such investigations are a topic of future research [28].
Early warning signals
The conceptualization of mental disorders as networks of
interacting symptoms allows utilizing insights from scien-
tific fields in which complex systems are well known. One
of the most important features of complex systems in this

stressor E, then symptoms of disorder X, then bridge symptoms B,

node in the network is a symptom as listed in the DSM. Overlapping
symptoms are depicted as one and the same node.
2 The network distance between symptoms of different disorders is
based on the average shortest path length. This measure is calculated
by averaging the number of steps (i.e., the number of connections) to
travel from each symptom of one disorder to each symptom of the
other disorder [24].

 regard is that they can display phase transitions [29] which
mark the transitions between healthy and ‘disordered’
states [30]. Identifying early warnings of such transitions is
a promising line of research known from other fields, such
as ecology or financial markets, where systems can reach a
tipping point [29–31]. Lakes, for example, can shift from a
clear state to a turbid state, and it is an important question
how to best predict such tipping points. Interestingly, right
before such phase transitions from one state to another, a
system displays early warning signals. Specifically, tran-
sitions are preceded by a phenomenon referred to as critical
slowing down [29, 32, 33], which means that it takes longer
for a system to recover from perturbations. This is reflected
by the fact that the system becomes more predictable by its
previous states: when close to a transition, the dynamics
slow down.
We can use the network of Susan (Fig. 1a) as an
example of a bi-stable system with two attractor states: a
healthy and a sick state. Assume Susan is now in a healthy
state, and an early warning signal would indicate an
upcoming tipping point, where her system may suddenly
move from healthy to sick. Before a transition occurs, the
system slows down, which implies that we can more reli-
ably predict the state of the system at the next time point.
In statistical terms, one such sign is increasing autore-
gressive coefficients (i.e., the self-predictive pathways
from a symptom or emotion to itself across time).
Van de Leemput et al. [30] estimated emotion dynamics
during critical transitions from healthy to depressed states
to see whether these are preceded by early warning signals.
Analyzing a large time-series data set, the authors showed
that systems exhibited signs of critical slowing down
before critical transitions [30]. A second study on early
warning signals was published recently on one depressed
patient that was measured over 239 days (1474 measure-
ments). This intensive idiographic study, in which the
patient decreased his antidepressant intake, also shows
evidence for early warning signals before he transitioned
into a depressive episode [34]. There is also some work
showing that individuals with higher levels of inertia in
their emotion dynamics are more likely to develop
depression 2.5 years later [35]. Inertia also refers to auto-
correlations and implies that emotion networks of indi-
viduals at higher risk to develop depression on the long
term are characterized by a slower recovery from a given
perturbation (i.e., the emotion networks of people at higher
risk might recover more slowly from the effect of external
influences than those at lower risk). While further inves-
tigations are required to understand the nature of emotional
inertia, it has been considered ‘‘a hallmark of maladaptive
emotion dynamics’’ [27] (p. 984).
An interesting topic in this context is the observation
that phase transitions may be more pronounced with
increasing levels of connectivity. That is, for weakly
connected symptom networks, negative external condi-
tions (i.e., stressful events) lead to a gradual increase in
symptoms, whereas for strongly connected networks,
external stress leads to a sudden shift from a healthy to
depressed state [30]; simulation studies with depression
networks support this notion [28, 36]. This may shed
new light on a long-standing discussion whether psy-
chopathology is dimensional or categorical [37]: net-
works
with
weak
connectivity
may
behave
as
a
continuum in response to stress (i.e., no sudden phase
transition; psychopathology is dimensional), while net-
works with strong connectivity may behave as either
healthy or disordered (i.e., sudden phase transitions;
psychopathology is categorical). This implies that dif-
ferent people may have the same diagnosis, for instance
MDD, but that the connectivity of the network structure
would determine whether the disorder is a continuum or
a dimension for them.
Prediction via network characteristics
Another important aspect of network research is the pre-
diction of the course of psychopathology from network
characteristics of groups of individuals. Two studies
showed that the temporal emotion networks of patients
with MDD and psychosis [38, 39] were more strongly
connected than the temporal emotion networks of healthy
controls. Stronger temporal connections between emotions
mean that the state of an emotion at a certain timepoint
depends strongly on the state of emotions at the previous
timepoint. In another study, van Borkulo et al. [40]
hypothesized that higher levels of connectivity in depres-
sed patients at baseline are associated with worse outcomes
at 2-year follow-up. They found that patients with persis-
tent depression at follow-up had a more densely connected
cross-sectional network at baseline compared to remitted
patients at follow-up—even after controlling for differ-
ences in severity [40]. This is consistent with other work
arguing that more densely connected temporal network
structures may be more vulnerable to psychopathology
[41]. Whether this also applies to particular individuals (in
contrast to network structures at the group level), however,
remains to be investigated with within-person analyses
[42, 43].
Another study on predicting the future course of psy-
chopathology showed that the most interconnected or
central depression symptoms in the baseline network were
the ones most predictive of future MDD onset (Boschloo
et al. [44]). Fatigue and depressed mood, for example, were
more predictive of MDD than other symptoms. This
implies that the nature of symptoms may play an important
role above and beyond the number of symptoms [45].

 Clinical intervention
Network analysis may provide promising leads towards
improving clinical prevention and intervention strategies
by investigating which symptoms are more strongly con-
nected or more central than others. In this section, we will
first explain the concept of centrality, and then discuss the
results of research that points to possible targets for
intervention.
The concept of centrality
If a symptom (e.g., depressed mood) has many connections
to other symptoms in a psychopathological system, it may
cause the development of these symptoms. The number of
connections of a symptom is known as degree centrality.
This type of centrality is illustrated in Fig. 3: the red
symptom is connected to six other symptoms, whereas all
other nodes have a lower number of connections (as indi-
cated by the numbers in each node). The red node thus has
a high (degree) centrality and, consequently, may be seen
as
a
risk
factor
for
developing
further
symptoms
[4, 10, 46–48].
That is, if someone develops a symptom that is central,
the probability of developing other symptoms will increase
more than when someone develops a peripheral symptom.
Degree centrality can be understood to quantify the
importance of a node in the network. Other common cen-
trality measures are closeness and betweenness [24], and
several papers have described and calculated these cen-
trality measures for psychopathological networks [46, 48].
In directed networks (e.g., longitudinal network models,
where nodes predict other nodes over time), degree can be
further specified with indegree being the number of con-
nections pointing towards the focal symptom and outde-
gree being the number of connections pointing from the
focal symptom to other symptoms (cf. [4]. Especially,
symptoms with a high outdegree might be viable targets for
intervention, since they influence many other symptoms.
What are good symptoms for clinical intervention?
Providing an overview of which symptoms are more cen-
tral than others across studies turns out to be a challenging
task for several reasons. Different studies used different
variables, making comparisons across studies challenging.
For MDD, for instance, different questionnaires were used
to assess symptomatology, or researchers analyzed other
types of variables, such as emotions or mental states
[38, 39, 49]. Other factors that vary across studies are the
temporal nature of the data (cross-sectional vs. time-series
data), the particular samples studied (e.g., healthy, mod-
erately depressed, and severely depressed samples), and the
network estimation methods (e.g., [4, 50]). With these
caveats in mind, it seems that the two DSM-5 [12] core
symptoms of MDD episode—depressed mood and loss of
interest/pleasure—along with energy/fatigue consistently
appear as central symptoms and could thus be understood
as potential targets for intervention [2, 19, 46, 51, 52].
Since other disorders have not been investigated as
frequently, it is not possible to identify similarities across
studies. Therefore, we summarize the available literature,
urging researchers to replicate these results before trans-
lating them into clinical settings. A cross-sectional network
study of 2405 adults with different substance abuse disor-
ders revealed that using the substance longer than planned
and that the drug interferes with life significantly were
highly central [53]. Interestingly, these problems appear in
the later course of the disorder, and provide a great
example for central symptoms that may not prove to be the
best targets for clinical intervention. The symptoms may be
central in the cross-sectional substance abuse study pri-
marily because they often develop as a consequence of
other symptoms. Rhemtulla et al. also found that the most
central symptoms in the full sample differed considerably
in their centrality across subgroups of people with different
types of substance use disorders (cannabis, sedatives,
stimulants, cocaine,
opioids,
and hallucinogens). For

 PTSD, McNally et al. concluded from analyzing cross-
sectional data that hypervigilance, impaired concentration,
and physiological reactivity to reminders of the trauma are
promising targets for intervention [54]. Sleep difficulty was
also among the most central symptoms, and aiming to
stabilize patients’ sleep might be a promising strategy
(even before initiating other forms of psychotherapy),
which could induce a cascade of symptom deactivation.
Researchers have also included variables other than the
symptoms of the disorder itself in networks. First, a cross-
sectional study on psychosis included information on
childhood trauma in the network of psychosis and psy-
chopathology symptoms, such as anxiety and depression.
Different types of childhood trauma were related to psy-
chosis symptoms, but only through general psychopathol-
ogy symptoms, such as anxiety [55]. Second, protective
(resilience) variables might also be included in psy-
chopathological networks (for a brief discussion, see [23]).
To our knowledge, only one cross-sectional study investi-
gated this, though not on a symptom level [56]. The authors
found resilience to be related to remission of depression
and showed it was central in a network with composite
scores of other cognitive processes, such as cognitive
control, experienced cognitive functioning, maladaptive
emotion regulation, and residual depressive symptomatol-
ogy. Third, Heeren and McNally [57] investigated the
cross-sectional network structure of the core symptoms
(fear and avoidance) of Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)
with laboratory measures on attention bias. They found that
attention bias played an important role in the network,
arguing that process-level measures from laboratory tasks
can shed more light on the mechanisms of SAD (Heeren
and McNally [57].
Future directions
Much exploratory network research has been conducted in
the field of psychopathology network research: but where
do we go from here? In this section, we will discuss some
future perspectives, structured into clinical and method-
ological research.
Clinical research
From a clinical perspective, we suggest to investigate four
topics. First, the network framework generates specific
hypotheses
about
treating
disorders
that
should
be
explored. In treating comorbid disorders, such as MDD and
GAD, for example, targeting bridge symptoms that transfer
influence from one part of the network to the other should
be the strategy of choice. A related hypothesis is that tar-
geting
central
symptoms
should
reduce
patients’
symptomatology [46].3 As the majority of research on
finding possible targets for intervention is based on cross-
sectional data, it is unclear whether an undirected edge
between symptoms A and B implies A ? B, A / B, or A
 
! B.4 Longitudinal analyses allow for an estimation of
directed networks which reveal the direction of the asso-
ciation between symptoms, such as A and B (e.g., [51]),
and present a more promising route to investigate possible
targets for clinical intervention.
Second, and related to the previous point, it should be
investigated whether intervening on central symptoms will
actually bring benefits to patients. Although studies have
collected ESM data in therapeutic settings to provide
feedback on patterns of affect [58–60], these data have not
been analyzed using network models to derive, for
instance, the most central symptoms—and a large crowd-
sourcing study that does provide feedback via personalized
dynamic networks does so only outside a therapeutic set-
ting [61]. Merging these two approaches may provide
valuable insights, and we are aware of one such pioneering
case study that investigated personalized feedback based
on network models within a therapeutic setting [62]. In
addition to treatment as usual, the patient received feed-
back on symptom dynamics and explored the feasibility,
acceptability, and usability of such an integrated individ-
ualized network approach. This initiated a therapeutic
dialogue about possible causes of treatment resistance and
may provide new directions towards personalized medicine
[63, 64]. While it may not always be feasible or possible to
target a specific symptom, establishing that the network
framework provides good explanatory and predictive
models of psychopathology may imply the need for
developing
new
approaches
for
targeting
specific
symptoms.
Third, it would be worthwhile to apply the network
perspective to yet unexplored mental disorders. The tem-
poral dynamics of symptoms of Binge Eating Disorder
(BED), for example, may be a suitable candidate [12]. One
causal pathway could be between the symptoms eating
until one feels uncomfortably full and feeling disgusted,
depressed, or guilty, which could provide insights into risk
factors for the development of BED episodes.
3 The simulation tool ‘‘vax’’ provides a beautiful explanation of
centrality and shows how such treatment should work by targeting the
most central nodes: http://vax.herokuapp.com/game.
4 Note that there are two further possibilities that can explain an
undirected edge between A and B: an unmodeled influence of a (set
of) latent variables C (A / C ? B); and conditioning on a common
effect D such that A ? D / B. The latter can arise if D is a variable
included in the network, but also when it is not, for instance when the
investigated sample has been selected on (a function of) a common
effect of the variables in the network.

 Fourth, besides looking at the interactions of problems
(e.g., symptoms), studying factors that contribute to resi-
lience may be worthwhile pursuing [65, 66]. Investigating
the role of protective factors in psychopathology networks
might inform us how these two opposing forces relate to
each other, and eventually inform clinical practice. For
example, Alice may benefit from more social interactions
in case social isolation leads to sad mood, while Bob may
benefit from physical activity in case sad mood is preceded
by lack of activity.
Methodological research
Exploring the above questions relies on the accurate and
reliable estimation of psychopathological networks. When
patients apply for treatment,5 there is often a waiting period
in which one could assess the emotion and symptom
dynamics with modern phone technology within an idio-
graphic momentary assessment study, and results could
inform treatment. Similarly, relapse prevention in remitted
patients may benefit from repeated assessment of core
symptoms and related factors over time to foresee relapse
in an early phase and take preventive measures to coun-
teract its course. This all sounds promising, but before this
can be put into effect, there are some methodological issues
that need to be addressed of which we will discuss three.
A first issue is what variables to study in psychopatho-
logical networks. While cross-sectional network studies
have focused on analyzing associations among symptoms,
ESM studies have focused on mood states, such as sadness,
happiness, anxiety, or anger [4, 38, 49, 67]. It is unclear at
present
what
level
of
variables
is
best
to
study
psychopathology.
A second issue is the time frame on which to measure
symptoms or emotions. In most ESM studies, the time
frame between measurements is a few hours. However, do
symptoms or affects change within hours or minutes or
days? This might differ for different pairs of symptoms:
experiencing somatic arousal (e.g., increased heart rate and
sweating) might lead to anticipating a panic attack [43],
which will occur within minutes. Sleep problems, on the
other hand, might build up for a few days before influ-
encing a person’s irritability. It is currently unknown what
the best timeframe is to capture dynamics.
Third, an important point is the generalization of group-
level results to the individual level, since many group-level
network studies have implied that the identified network
structure of the population is more or less reflective of the
networks of all individual participants (e.g., [68, 69]). A
well-known example of this phenomenon, known as
Simpson’s Paradox, is the speed–accuracy tradeoff. At a
group-level, a negative relationship exists between typing
speed and typing accuracy: people with higher typing
speed make fewer errors, likely because experience leads to
faster typing and fewer mistakes. At the individual level,
however, a person who types faster will make more, not
less errors [70]. While this is an extreme example—it
seems unlikely that symptoms of mental disorders are
predominantly positively associated at group-level, but
negatively in the individual—we currently do not know to
what extent group-level networks differ from individual
networks [43]. A related point was made by Bos and Jonge
[71] and Bos and Wanders [42] who warn that between-
person effects should not be confused with within-person
effects. Taken together, this implies that we need future
studies that investigate to which degree idiographic net-
works match group-level networks, and to disentangle
between-person from within-person effects.
Finally, numerous network papers analyzed data that
contained a skip structure. This is often the case when large
populations are screened via the DSM diagnostic criteria.
For a diagnosis of MDD, for instance, subjects need to
endorse at least one of the two core symptoms depressed
mood or anhedonia. If that is not the case, the remaining
seven MDD symptoms are skipped. In statistical analyses,
such skipped items are usually recoded as 0s (e.g.,
[10, 19, 53]), but just because someone does not endorse
the core symptoms does not mean that the person cannot
exhibit other MDD symptoms. The recoding of missing
data to 0s may pose a considerable problem, because it
introduces spurious correlations among items (for many
people, the seven remaining items will be coded as 0s and
thus be highly correlated, although this may not reflect the
true correlations among items). Although Boschloo et al.
[18] showed similarity of the network structure based on
the original data with 49% missing and a subsample with
less than 20% missing, it still may have introduced bias.
Future research is required to investigate imputation

Summary
In contrast to current categorical diagnostic classifications
that hardly fit clinical reality, the network approach offers a
model that captures both complexity and individual vari-
ation in psychopathology that clinicians and patients
immediately recognize. Due to recent statistical advances,
these networks and the resulting hypotheses can now be
empirically tested and validated, both in nomothetic and
idiographic (n = 1) designs. Electronic devices, such as
smartphones, watches, and other ‘wearable tech’ offer the
possibility
of
continuous/repeated
data

 address important clinical issues regarding vulnerability for
and onset of psychopathology as well as relapse preven-
tion. However, it is also likely to be helpful in regular
therapy as it enhances patients’ insight into their own
symptom dynamics and how these relate to contextual and
behavioral factors that they themselves may be able to
influence. Pilot studies suggest that this type of objective
and differentiated feedback attributes to traditional ‘talking
therapy’ and may also lead to more informed pharma-
cotherapy [72]. Taken together, the network approach
offers a promising conceptual framework to further
develop personalized medicine in psychiatry.
