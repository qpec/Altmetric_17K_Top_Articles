BACKGROUND
Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events; 
whether treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) prevents major cardio-
vascular events is uncertain.
METHODS
After a 1-week run-in period during which the participants used sham CPAP, we ran-
domly assigned 2717 eligible adults between 45 and 75 years of age who had moderate-to-
severe obstructive sleep apnea and coronary or cerebrovascular disease to receive CPAP 
treatment plus usual care (CPAP group) or usual care alone (usual-care group). The pri-
mary composite end point was death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, 
stroke, or hospitalization for unstable angina, heart failure, or transient ischemic attack. 
Secondary end points included other cardiovascular outcomes, health-related quality of 
life, snoring symptoms, daytime sleepiness, and mood.
RESULTS
Most of the participants were men who had moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea 
and minimal sleepiness. In the CPAP group, the mean duration of adherence to CPAP 
therapy was 3.3 hours per night, and the mean apnea–hypopnea index (the number of 
apnea or hypopnea events per hour of recording) decreased from 29.0 events per hour at 
baseline to 3.7 events per hour during follow-up. After a mean follow-up of 3.7 years, a 
primary end-point event had occurred in 229 participants in the CPAP group (17.0%) and 
in 207 participants in the usual-care group (15.4%) (hazard ratio with CPAP, 1.10; 95% 
confidence interval, 0.91 to 1.32; P 
= 
0.34). No significant effect on any individual or other 
composite cardiovascular end point was observed. CPAP significantly reduced snoring and 
daytime sleepiness and improved health-related quality of life and mood.
CONCLUSIONS
Therapy with CPAP plus usual care, as compared with usual care alone, did not prevent 
cardiovascular events in patients with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea and es-
tablished cardiovascular disease. (Funded by the National Health and Medical Research

bstructive sleep apnea causes epi-
sodic hypoxemia and nocturnal sympa-
thetic nervous system activation1 and ele-
vates blood pressure2 and markers of oxidative 
stress, inflammation, and hypercoagulation.3,4 
Large negative intrathoracic pressure swings also 
impose mechanical stress on the heart and great 
vessels.5-7 Population-based and sleep-clinic–
based cohort studies have shown an association 
between obstructive sleep apnea and cardiovas-
cular events,8-16 particularly stroke.17 Randomized, 
controlled trials have shown that treatment with 
continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) low-
ers systolic blood pressure by 2 to 3 mm Hg in 
patients with normotensive obstructive sleep 
apnea18 and by 6 to 7 mm Hg in patients with 
resistant hypertension,19 improves endothelial 
function,20 and increases insulin sensitivity.21 
Observational clinical studies have shown that 
the use of CPAP is associated with lower rates of 
cardiovascular complications and of death from 
cardiovascular causes, especially among patients 
who are adherent to treatment.10,13
Obstructive sleep apnea is a common condi-
tion among patients with cardiovascular disease, 
affecting 40 to 60% of such patients.12,16,22,23 Be-
cause the risks of recurrent cardiovascular events 
among these patients remain high despite con-
temporary therapies, CPAP could be a useful 
additional treatment for the prevention of these 
events. We describe the main results of the Sleep 
Apnea Cardiovascular Endpoints (SAVE) study, a 
secondary prevention trial that was designed to 
evaluate the effectiveness of CPAP in reducing 
the rate of cardiovascular events among patients 
with obstructive sleep apnea.24
Methods
Study Design and Oversight
The SAVE study was an international, multi-
center, randomized, parallel-group, open-label 
trial, with blinded end-point assessment. Details 
of the design and analysis plan of the trial have 
been published previously.24,25 An executive com-
mittee (see the Supplementary Appendix, avail-
able with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) 
designed the study and supervised the conduct 
of the trial and the collection of the data. The 
Adelaide Institute for Sleep Health of Flinders 
University of South Australia was responsible for 
the overall management of the trial and provided 
the core sleep laboratory analysis and monitor-
ing of the CPAP data and treatment at the sites. 
Investigators at the George Institute for Global 
Health coordinated the trial, managed the data-
base, and performed the statistical analyses. All 
the authors vouch for the accuracy and complete-
ness of the data and analyses and for the fidelity 
of the trial to the protocol, available at NEJM.org. 
An independent data and safety monitoring board 
monitored unblinded trial results and safety 
events. The trial protocol was approved by all 
appropriate regulatory authorities and ethics com-
mittees at the participating centers. All partici-
pants provided written informed consent.
The National Health and Medical Research 
Council of Australia and Philips Respironics 
provided the main funding for the trial. In-kind 
donations were provided by Respironics for the 
CPAP equipment and by ResMed for the sleep 
apnea diagnostic devices. None of the funding 
agencies contributed to the design of the trial, 
the collection or analysis of the data, the writing 
of the manuscript, or the decision to submit the 
manuscript for publication.
Patients and Procedures
Patients were recruited at 89 clinical centers in 
7 countries; eligibility criteria included an age be-
tween 45 and 75 years, a diagnosis of coronary 
artery disease or cerebrovascular disease, and a 
diagnosis of moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep 
apnea. The diagnosis of moderate-to-severe ob-
structive sleep apnea, which was defined as an 
oxygen desaturation index (the number of times 
per hour during the oximetry recording that the 
blood oxygen saturation level drops by ≥4 per-
centage points from baseline) of at least 12, was 
established with the use of a home sleep-study 
screening device (ApneaLink, ResMed) and was 
confirmed by review of the data at a central core 
sleep laboratory. Patients were excluded from the 
study if they reported severe daytime sleepiness 
(Epworth Sleepiness Scale score >15; scores 
range from 0 to 24, with higher scores indicat-
ing greater severity) or were considered to have 
an increased risk of an accident from falling 
asleep, if they had very severe hypoxemia (oxy-
gen saturation <80% for >10% of recording time), 
or if they had a pattern of Cheyne–Stokes respira-
tion on the ApneaLink nasal pressure recording.
Potential participants were required to have 
a minimum level of adherence to CPAP therapy,

CPAP in Obstructive Sleep Apnea
which was defined as an average of 3 hours per 
night, during a 1-week run-in period in which 
sham CPAP was used (i.e., CPAP at subtherapeu-
tic pressure). Further details of the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria and of the procedures per-
formed at the core sleep laboratory are provided 
in the Supplementary Appendix.
Randomization and Interventions
After eligibility was confirmed, the patients were 
randomly assigned, at a central location, to re-
ceive either CPAP therapy plus usual care (CPAP 
group) or usual care alone (usual-care group). 
Randomization was performed with the use of a 
minimization procedure to balance the group 
assignments according to site, type of cardiovas-
cular disease (cardiac, cerebrovascular, or both), 
and severity of daytime sleepiness (Epworth 
Sleepiness Scale score <11 vs. ≥11).
The patients who were assigned to receive 
mask-delivered CPAP treatment were provided 
with an automated positive airway pressure 
machine (REMstar Auto, M or PR series, Philips 
Respironics) that was initially set in automatic 
mode for 1 week and thereafter fixed to the 90th 
percentile of pressure that was calculated by the 
automated positive airway pressure device from 
the recorded data. The core sleep laboratory 
monitored trends in adherence to CPAP therapy 
and provided corrective advice to investigators 
(further details are provided in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). Concomitant management of car-
diovascular risk factors was performed in accor-
dance with national guidelines. All participants 
were given advice on healthful sleep habits and 
lifestyle changes to minimize obstructive sleep 
apnea. Clinic visits were scheduled for all partici-
pants at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and annually 
thereafter; the participants were contacted by tele-
phone at 6 months between annual clinic visits.
Study Measurements
At randomization and at each follow-up visit, 
participants had resting blood pressure and 
heart rate measured at the clinic, and details of 
current medication use and health behaviors were 
documented through a structured interview. 
Among the participants in the CPAP group, data 
on adherence to the use of the CPAP device were 
recorded. At randomization, at 6 months, and 
at 2 and 4 years, anthropometric measurements 
were obtained in all participants, and all partici-
pants completed several questionnaires: question-
naires that assessed symptoms of obstructive 
sleep apnea (snoring, witnessed episodes of ap-
nea, and degree of sleepiness according to the 
Epworth Sleepiness Scale score), the Medical Out-
comes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey 
(SF-36; scores range from 0 to 100, with higher 
scores indicating better quality of life) for assess-
ment of health-related quality of life, and the 
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (on which 
anxiety and depression scores range from 0 to 21, 
with higher scores indicating more symptoms) 
for assessment of mood. Electrocardiography was 
performed in all participants at the time of ran-
domization and at 2 years. The European Qual-
ity of Life–5 Dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D; 
scores range from 1 to 3, with higher scores 
indicating more problems across five categories 
of quality of life) was administered only at the 
end-of-study visit.
The end-of-study visits were conducted from 
September 2015 through January 2016 (except in 
India, where they were conducted from July 
through October 2013). In addition to performing 
a regular central review of data quality, research 
staff visited the participating sites to monitor 
and verify the completeness and authenticity of 
source documents and adverse-event reporting. 
Additional details on study measurements and 
monitoring procedures are provided in the Sup-
plementary Appendix.
Study End Points
A committee whose members were unaware of 
the study-group assignments adjudicated the ma-
jor cardiovascular outcomes specified in the pro-
tocol. The primary end point was a composite of 
death from any cardiovascular cause, myocardial 
infarction (including silent myocardial infarc-
tion), stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure, 
acute coronary syndrome (including unstable an-
gina), or transient ischemic attack. Prespecified 
secondary cardiovascular end points included the 
individual components of the primary composite 
end point, other composites of cardiovascular 
events, revascularization procedures, new-onset 
atrial fibrillation, new-onset diabetes mellitus, 
and death from any cause. Other secondary end 
points included symptoms of obstructive sleep 
apnea, health-related quality of life, and mood.
Prespecified safety end points were assessed 
each time the participant was contacted; these

end points included all serious adverse events, 
self-reported accidents causing personal injury 
that occurred while the participant was driving 
or while at work, and any accidents or near-miss 
accidents that occurred as a result of the partici-
pant falling asleep. Two safety end points that 
were not prespecified — the number of self-
reported road-traffic accidents from any cause 
and the number of days off from work because 
of poor health — were also assessed. Descrip-
tions of the study end points and of the proce-
dures used by the data and safety monitoring 
board and end-point adjudicators are provided in 
the Supplementary Appendix.
Statistical Analysis
Our original plan was to recruit 5000 patients. 
In 2012, challenges in achieving recruitment 
targets prompted us to review the accumulated 
blinded study data and an updated meta-regres-
sion of studies of cardiovascular events and sever-
ity of obstructive sleep apnea. The meta-regres-
sion showed that cardiovascular risk increased 
by 25 to 32% for every increase of 10 events per 
hour in the apnea–hypopnea index (the number 
of occurrences of apnea or hypopnea per hour of 
sleep), which was a stronger relationship than 
we had originally assumed.24 In consideration of 
this information, together with interim blinded 
trial data showing an annual event rate of 6.86% 
and better-than-expected adherence to CPAP ther-
apy, we revised our sample size to 2500 patients; 
we estimated that with this sample size, the study 
would have 90% statistical power (at an alpha 
level of 0.05) to detect a 25% lower incidence with 
CPAP plus usual care than with usual care alone 
of the primary composite cardiovascular end 
point, which was anticipated to occur in 533 pa-
tients overall over a mean follow-up of 4.5 years.
The primary analysis was an unadjusted sur-
vival analysis performed according to the inten-
tion-to-treat principle with the use of Cox pro-
portional-hazards regression modeling that was 
based on positively adjudicated events. We per-
formed a series of sensitivity analyses, including 
an analysis with adjustment for stratification 
variables, region, and severity of obstructive 
sleep apnea; an analysis with Poisson regression 
to account for participants with multiple events; 
and an analysis that included all events that were 
reported by the investigators and not just those 
that were positively adjudicated. To estimate the 
effect in patients who were adherent to CPAP 
therapy, which was defined as an average of 
4 hours or more of treatment per night over the 
first 2 years, we used prespecified propensity-
score matching to match adherent patients one-
to-one with participants selected from the usual-
care (control) group who never used CPAP. The 
change in clinical variables from baseline to 48 
months or to the end-of-study visit (whichever 
came first) was assessed with the use of analysis 
of covariance with adjustment for baseline values. 
All P values are two-sided and were not adjusted 
for multiple testing. Statistical analyses were 
performed with the use of SAS software, version 
9.3 (SAS Institute). (Additional details regarding 
the sample-size calculations and other aspects 
of the statistical analysis are provided in the 
Supplementary Appendix.)
Results
Study Participants
A total of 15,325 patients were assessed for eli-
gibility; 5844 met the initial eligibility criteria and 
underwent ApneaLink testing, and 3246 entered 
the 1-week run-in phase (Fig. 1). The 2717 pa-
tients who were eligible for participation after 
the run-in phase were enrolled in the study from 
December 2008 through November 2013 and were 
randomly assigned to receive CPAP plus usual care 
(1359 patients) or usual care alone (1358 patients).
All 21 participants from one site were excluded 
from the study because it was determined during 
site monitoring that the required standard for 
conducting clinical trials was not met; in addi-
tion, 9 other participants withdrew consent at 
the time of randomization or did not adhere to 
the trial protocol from the time of randomiza-
tion. Thus, 2687 participants were included in the 
primary analysis (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The mean 
age of the participants was 61 years, and 81% 
were men. The mean body-mass index (the weight 
in kilograms divided by the square of the height 
in meters) of the participants was 29; the mean 
oxygen desaturation index, 28 events per hour; 
and the mean Epworth Sleepiness Scale score, 
7.4. Participants were evenly divided between 
those with coronary artery disease and those 
with cerebrovascular disease.
Final follow-up visits were completed by Janu-
ary 2016; a total of 147 patients discontinued their 
participation in the study before the intended

Testing for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) involved the use a home sleep‑study screening device (ApneaLink 
[ResMed]). During the 1‑week run‑in period, the participants received sham continuous positive airway pressure 
(CPAP) and were educated on the use of the equipment. In the case of participants who discontinued the study, 
only data that were acquired before discontinuation were included in the analysis.

final visit, but their data up to the time of with-
drawal were included in the primary analysis 
performed in the intention-to-treat population 
(Fig. 1). The mean duration of follow-up was 3.7 
years. (Further details on the study participants 
are provided in Tables S1, S2, and S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix.)
Intervention Adherence, Medications, and 
Lifestyle Factors
The mean duration of use of the sham CPAP 
device during the 1-week run-in phase was 5.2 
hours per night (Table 1). Among the partici-
pants in the CPAP group, the mean (±SD) dura-
tion of adherence to CPAP therapy in the first 
month of treatment was 4.4±2.2 hours per night, 
which decreased to 3.5±2.4 hours per night by 
12 months and remained relatively stable there-
after (mean adherence during follow-up, 3.3±2.3 
hours). The residual apnea–hypopnea index dur-
ing CPAP use, as measured by the CPAP ma-
chine, averaged 3.7 events per hour, which indi-
cated good control of obstructive sleep apnea 
with CPAP. Of the 1346 patients in the CPAP 
group, 566 (42%) had good adherence to treat-
ment (≥4 hours per night) during follow-up. Of 
the 1341 patients who were followed in the 
usual-care group, 90 (6.7%) tried CPAP but only 
57 (4.3%) continued the treatment. No signifi-
cant differences were observed between the 
CPAP group and the usual-care group in the use 
of medications for diabetes mellitus and cardio-
vascular conditions, in lifestyle factors including 
diet and smoking, and in body-mass index from 
baseline to the end of the study. (Further details 
are provided in Fig. S1 and Tables S4 through S6 
in the Supplementary Appendix.)
Primary End Point
A primary end-point event was confirmed in 436 
participants — 229 (17.0%) in the CPAP group 
and 207 (15.4%) in the usual-care group (hazard 
ratio with CPAP, 1.10; 95% confidence interval 
[CI], 0.91 to 1.32; P 
= 
0.34) (Table 2 and Fig. 2). 
No significant effect of CPAP was found in the 
adjusted analysis or in the analyses that were 
based on total event rates and on primary end-
point events reported by the investigators. No 
significant heterogeneity was observed for the 
primary end point across subgroups defined ac-
cording to region (China vs. outside China), age 
group (>60 years vs. ≤60 years), sex, severity of 
obstructive sleep apnea, body-mass index (<30 
vs. ≥30), daytime sleepiness, type of cardiovas-
cular disease, and presence or absence of diabe-
tes mellitus.
Anthropometric and disease characteristics 
of patients with good adherence to CPAP therapy 
(≥4 hours per night) differed from those of pa-
tients with lower adherence and from the pa-
tients in the usual-care group as a whole. One-
to-one propensity-score matching was performed 
to compare 561 patients who were adherent to 
CPAP therapy with 561 patients in the usual-care 
group. Among these propensity-score–matched 
patients, 184 primary end-point events occurred 
— 86 (15.3%) in the CPAP group and 98 (17.5%) 
in the usual-care group (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% 
CI, 0.60 to 1.07; P 
= 
0.13). The adjusted Cox re-
gression model (adjusted for the baseline factors 
used in the propensity-score–matching compari-
son) that compared patients with good adher-
ence and those with poor adherence in the CPAP 
group with the patients in the usual-care group 
showed a similar result. (Further details on the 
results for the primary end point are provided in 
Tables S7 through S12 and Figs. S2 and S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix.)
Secondary and Other End Points
No significant between-group differences were 
observed in any of the cause-specific or compos-
ite secondary cardiovascular end points in the 
primary analysis (Table 2) or in the subsidiary 
analyses, except for a higher rate of total hospi-
tal admissions for transient ischemic attack 
among the patients in the CPAP group (relative 
risk, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.05 to 4.99; P 
= 
0.04). The 
propensity score–matched analyses showed that 
the patients who were adherent to CPAP therapy 
had a lower risk of stroke than those in the 
usual-care group (hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 
0.32 to 1.00; P 
= 
0.05), as well as a lower risk of 
the nonprespecified composite end point of ce-
rebral events (hazard ratio, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.30 to 
0.90; P 
= 
0.02), but these results were not adjust-
ed for multiple testing. A post hoc CPAP dose–
response analysis of the primary and secondary 
cardiovascular end points showed no significant 
association.

group difference in the change from baseline in 
Epworth Sleepiness Scale score, −2.5; 95% CI, 
−2.8 to −2.2; P<0.001) (Table 3). Greater reduc-
tions from baseline in the anxiety and depres-
sion subscale scores of the Hospital Anxiety and 
Depression Scale were also observed in the CPAP 
group than in the usual-care group (Table 3), 
and the percentage of patients with clinically 
relevant depression scores was 25 to 30% lower 
in the CPAP group than in the usual-care group 
at the end of follow-up. The CPAP group had 
greater improvement in scores on the physical 
and mental subscales of the SF-36 than the 
usual-care group (Table 3), as well as fewer days 
off from work because of poor health (a nonpre-
specified end point) than the usual-care group 
(Table 4). The number of serious adverse events 
and the rate of road-traffic accidents and acci-
dents causing injury did not differ significantly 
between the two groups (Table 4). (Further de-

Discussion
This secondary prevention trial in adults with 
cardiovascular disease and obstructive sleep apnea 
showed that the risk of serious cardiovascular 
events was not lower among patients who re-
ceived treatment with CPAP in addition to usual 
care than among those who received usual care 
alone. Treatment with CPAP was associated with 
a greater reduction in symptoms of daytime sleep-
iness and with improved health-related quality 
of life, mood, and attendance at work. This study 
was not powered to provide definitive answers 
regarding the effects of CPAP on secondary car-
diovascular end points, but there was no indica-
tion of a significant benefit with respect to any 
cause-specific cardiovascular outcome.
Three other randomized trials have investigat-
ed the effect of CPAP on cardiovascular end points 
in patients with obstructive sleep apnea.26-28 Two 
studies — a multicenter study conducted in 
Spain that compared CPAP with usual care in 
725 patients with obstructive sleep apnea who 
did not have prior cardiovascular disease26 and a 
single-center study involving 224 patients with 
obstructive sleep apnea and coronary artery dis-
ease who had just undergone revascularization28 
— showed no difference in composite cardiovas-
cular end points over several years of follow-up, 
although in adjusted analyses, both studies re-
ported better outcomes among patients who 
were adherent to CPAP therapy (≥4 hours per 
night) than among patients who did not receive 
CPAP or who used CPAP less than 4 hours per 
night. The third study involving 140 patients 
with recent ischemic stroke showed no effect of 
CPAP on event-free survival over 2 years.27
One important potential limitation of our 
trial is that, for several of the participating coun-
tries, the diagnosis and treatment of sleep apnea 
were not well established in clinical practice when 
the trial began. However, before trial recruit-
ment, we expended substantial time and effort 
in conducting training workshops for investiga-
tors and study coordinators. In addition, exten-
sive site monitoring was conducted throughout 
the trial to ensure a high standard of study 
conduct.
Participants in the SAVE study who were as-
signed to CPAP adhered to the treatment for a 
mean of 3.3 hours per night over several years, 
which is similar to the mean adherence in other 
reports of CPAP use in patients who had no or 
minimal daytime sleepiness29,30 and which is con-
sistent with CPAP use in clinical practice.31 How-
ever, although this overall level of adherence to 
CPAP therapy exceeded the estimates in our 
power calculations, it may still have been insuf-
ficient to provide the level of effect on cardiovas-
cular outcomes that had been hypothesized. For 
practical reasons and to ensure efficient recruit-
ment and consistency of data across multiple 
sites, we used a simple screening device (Apnea-
Link) that was based on oximetry and nasal pres-
sure recordings and used automated algorithms 
to analyze signals, rather than the conventional 
standard test for obstructive sleep apnea in which 
polysomnographic data from an overnight stay 
in a hospital or clinic are scored manually. The 
ApneaLink screening device has been shown to 
be a reliable method for diagnosing moderate-
to-severe obstructive sleep apnea.32,33 To mitigate

CPAP in Obstructive Sleep Apnea
the risk of recruiting patients with predomi-
nantly central apnea rather than obstructive 
sleep apnea, we excluded patients with overt 
heart failure and patients in whom the nasal 
pressure signals showed a predominant pattern 
of Cheyne–Stokes respiration.
In conclusion, in a large group of adults with 
both cardiovascular disease and moderate-to-
severe obstructive sleep apnea, the use of CPAP 
therapy had no significant effect on the preven-
tion of recurrent serious cardiovascular events, 
despite significantly reduced sleepiness and other 
symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea and im-
proved quality-of-life measures.
