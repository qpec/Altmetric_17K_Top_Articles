AbstrAct
Objectives To determine if a diabetes prevention program 
(DPP) delivered by a commercial weight management 
provider using a UK primary care referral pathway could 
reduce the progression to type 2 diabetes (T2D) in those 
diagnosed with non-diabetic hyperglycemia (NDH—being 
at high risk of developing T2D).
Research design This is a quasi-experimental 
translational research study.
Methods 14 primary care practices identified, recruited 
and referred patients with NDH (fasting plasma glucose 
≥5.5 to ≤6.9 mmol/L and/or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 
≥42 to 47 mmol/mol (6.0%–6.4%)) and a body mass index 
(BMI) ≥30 kg/m2 to a DPP. Eligible patients were asked 
to contact Weight Watchers to book onto their DPP, an 
intensive lifestyle intervention which included a 90 min 
activation session followed by the offer of 48 weekly 
Weight Watchers community group meetings. Patients’ 
blood tests were repeated by primary care, weight change 
plus self-reported data was recorded by Weight Watchers.
Results 166 patients were referred to the program and 
149 were eligible. 79% of eligible patients attended 
an activation session (117 eligible patients) and 77% 
started the weekly sessions. The study sample was 
primarily female (75%), white (90%), with 5% living in 
the most deprived quintile in the UK. Using intention-
to-treat analysis, the DPP resulted in a mean reduction 
in HbA1c of 2.84 mmol/mol at 12 months (from 
43.42±1.28 to 40.58±3.41, p<0.01). 38% of patients 
returned to normoglycemia and 3% developed T2D at 
12 months. There was a mean weight reduction in BMI 
of 3.2 kg/m2 at 12 months (35.5 kg/m2±5.4 to 32.3 kg/
m2±5.2, p<0.01).
Conclusion A UK primary care referral route partnered 
with this commercial weight management provider 
can deliver an effective DPP. The lifestyle changes and 
weight loss achieved in the intervention translated 
into considerable reductions in diabetes risk, with an 
immediate and significant public health impact.
IntROduCtIOn
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a significant public 
health challenge.1 The risk of developing 
T2D is strongly influenced by lifestyle factors, 
the risk of developing T2D is significantly 
reduced via weight loss, specifically a 7% 
reduction in starting weight achieved via a 
lower energy diet2 and an increase in phys-
ical activity (PA).3 Early diagnosis of T2D is 
important because poor management of 
glycemic control is linked to poor health 
outcomes such as irreversible microvascular 
damage to vision (retinopathy) and circula-
tion (neuropathy).4 It is estimated that the 
risks of macrovascular disease such as cardio-
vascular disease (CVD) and stroke are more 
than five times greater in diabetic individuals 
than non-diabetic individuals and life expec-
tancy is on average 10 years shorter.5

Original research
significance of this study
What is already known on this subject?
 
► Type 2 diabetes is a major cause of morbidity and 
mortality. The risk of developing type 2 diabetes is 
strongly influenced by lifestyle factors; there is a 
significant reduction in the risk of developing T2D 
achieved via weight loss.
What are the new findings?
 
► The evidence for reducing type 2 diabetes risk is 
well established; there is a need to investigate how 
to implement these prevention programs in the real 
world utilizing existing referral pathways. This study 
found that patients referred by primary care in the 
UK to a diabetes prevention program delivered by a 
commercial weight management provider achieved 
a significant reduction in diabetes risk.
How might these results change the focus of 
research or clinical practice?
 
► This study informs clinicians that a UK primary care 
referral route was successful in referring patients to 
a diabetes prevention program and that partnering 
with a commercial weight management diabetes 
prevention program translated into considerable 
reductions in diabetes risk.

Obesity Studies
A new diagnosis of T2D is made every 2 min in the 
UK.6 Both incidence and prevalence in the UK are 
rising. Since 1996, the number of people diagnosed 
with diabetes has increased from 1.4 to 2.9 million.6 By 
2025, it is estimated that five million people will have 
diabetes, around one in seven adults.6 The increase 
in prevalence of those at risk of developing T2D is 
closely linked to the increasing prevalence of obesity, 
with 80% of people with T2D classified as overweight 
or obese.7 A 1 kg/m2 increase in body mass index 
(BMI) increases the risk of developing T2D by 8.4%.8 
Prevalence modeling undertaken in 2015 estimated 
that there are currently a further five million people 
(11.4% of the 16+ population in England) meeting the 
criteria for non-diabetic hyperglycemia (NDH) in the 
UK (NDH is defined as a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 
≥5.5 to ≤6.9 mmol/L and/or HbA1c between ≥42 and 
47 mmol/mol (6.0%–6.4%)) which means they are at 
high risk of developing T2D.9
A recent systematic review by Public Health 
England (PHE)10 demonstrated that modest weight 
loss,11 improvements in diet quality,12 and increases in 
PA levels3 can reduce incidence of T2D by more than 
50% for individuals with NDH.2 Until recently, most 
DPPs have focused on establishing the efficacy of life-
style interventions on risk reduction in randomized 
controlled trial (RCT) settings. With the evidence now 
well established there is a need to investigate how to 
implement these findings in wider healthcare settings 
to reach the significant numbers at risk in the general 
population. Interventions for weight loss have demon-
strated that commercial weight management providers 
are more effective and efficient at achieving weight loss 
than interventions delivered by primary care alone.13 
The UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excel-
lence (NICE) recommends that for maximal weight 
loss, certain commercial weight management providers 
have been proven effective in the long term, one of 
which includes Weight Watchers (WW).14 Evidenced 
by RCTs, they meet the requirements for intensive life-
style interventions for weight management and have 
achieved significant weight loss outcomes.13 In the 
USA, a recent trial used an augmented commercial 
weight management program (WW) in the interven-
tion arm of an RCT for a community-based DPP.15 
Intervention participants (n=112) lost significantly 
more weight than controls (n=113) at 12 months; 
−5.51 kg (±0.63) versus −0.22 kg (±0.69) (p<0.001), 
with greater improvements in HbA1c −0.25% (±0.03) 
versus controls −0.18% (±0.03) (p<0.068) and an 
increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol 
level +6.29 mg/dL (±1.05) versus controls +2.99 mg/dL 
(±1.14) (p<0.36). This suggests that commercial weight 
management programs could significantly increase the 
availability of DPPs making an immediate and signifi-
cant public health impact. However, the effectiveness 
of such interventions using UK clinical primary care 
settings has not been fully evaluated.
This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a Local 
Authority commissioned DPP delivered by this commer-
cial weight management provider for patients with NDH 
being identified and referred by primary care in the UK 
to reduce the risk of developing T2D. This paper presents 
findings at 12 months only; patients are being followed 
up for 24 months.

study design
This is a quasi-experimental translational research 
study. This study is reported in accordance with 
the Standards for QUality Improvement Reporting 
Excellence guidelines.16 The study was performed in 
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki Protocols 
and received ethics approval (the University of West-
minster, ethics number: VRE1516-0978). Patients gave 
informed consent before taking part. The efficacy of 
lifestyle modification treatments have been well estab-
lished by earlier diabetes prevention trials.2 Therefore, 
taking account of ethical considerations, all patients 
identified by primary care were offered the program. 
Consequently, the study did not have a control group.
Patient involvement
A qualitative study arm was conducted alongside this 
evaluation to obtain feedback on patient expecta-
tions, experiences and preferences. As qualitative data 
were gathered from completers and dropouts, it was 
anonymized and fed back to the implementation team. 
In addition, Bromley Public Health held two patient 
participation events during the evaluation to enable 
current and completed patients to reflect on progress 
and areas for improvement. This patient engagement 
will shape the future delivery of the Weight Watchers 
Diabetes Prevention Program (WWDPP). The results 
of both the qualitative and quantitative research will 
be disseminated to study participants.
eligibility criteria
Eligibility: inclusion criteria were as follows:
 
► Registered with a Bromley general practitioner (GP).

► Currently attending or wanting to be referred to the 
Stop Smoking Service.
 
► If pregnant.
 
► Aged 17 years old or under.
 
► Unwilling or unable to give informed consent.
 
► Unwilling to attend group-based interventions.
Routine clinical judgment was used by primary care to 
assess whether a patient should be excluded if,
 
► Patient was being examined for having an eating dis-
order or was undergoing treatment for having an eat-
ing disorder according to NICE guidance.17
 
► Primary care and the patient agreed they would ben-
efit from more intensive one to one personal super-
vision either with a dietitian or clinical management 
or from bariatric surgery rather than the group-based 
WWDPP intervention.
 
► If the patient declined the offer of the intervention 
it was deemed the patient not motivated to change 
lifestyle behaviors at the time of recruitment and ex-
cluded.
sample size
Sample size was calculated with G*Power. Using a power of 
0.90, significance level of 0.05 and a moderate effect size 
of 0.3, 109 patients were needed to treat. One hundred 
and seventeen patients received the intervention and 
were analyzed via intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Based 
on the previous literature, the estimated dropout rate was 
between 10% and 30%; in order to treat 109 patients, a 
minimum of 120–142 patients needed to be referred to 
the program, but the actual number of patients referred 
was 166 patients.18. The referral pathway flow diagram 
illustrates the referral pathway, recruitment and adher-
ence of patients (figure 1).
Primary care recruitment and referral process
Twenty-five GP practices were invited to take part in this 
WWDPP (out of 45 practices in Bromley); they were 
invited to an information evening where they could find 
out more about the WWDPP and how to take part and 
refer patients. Of these 25 practices invited, 14 practices 
(56%) went onto identify, recruit and refer patients with 
NDH to the WWDPP. Patients were recruited opportunis-
tically on diagnosis of NDH, via a practice register search 
to identify NDH patients (GP operating system used 
was EMIS Web) or via an NHS Health Check19 where a 
diabetes risk assessment is undertaken. In an NHS Health 
Check patients who met the diabetes filter (ie, had a 
blood pressure ≥140 systolic and/or ≥90 diastolic and/or 
a BMI ≥30 kg/m2 (BMI ≥27.5 kg/m2 for those from an 
ethnic minority origin such as African, Asian or Carib-
bean origin)) were sent for a HbA1c or FPG blood test. 
Primary care staff assessed patients against the eligibility 
criteria, then explained the program, gained informed 
consent and took baseline measurements. Patients were 
given a referral form with WWDPP information included 
and asked to contact the WW call center. When the 
patient phoned the call center, they were given further 
information about the intervention and, if still inter-
ested, booked into an activation session. The patient 
had access to the program at the point of referral; there-
fore, an ineligible patient could attend if primary care 
referred a patient that does not fit the inclusion criteria 
if referred within their consultation. A lifestyle inter-
vention has multiple health benefits for any patient, so 
ineligible patients were allowed to continue so that the 
GP—patient relationship was not negatively affected. 
The average number of days the patient took to attend 
WWDPP session after they attended the activation session 
was 11 days (ranged from 1 to 98 days). Figure 2 illus-
trates the WWDPP design.
description of the intervention
The intervention comprised a structured 90 min activa-
tion session on diabetes prevention plus the standard 
evidence-based WW program for 48 weeks. The aims of 
the activation session were to set two goals.
 
► First, to lose and maintain a weight loss of at least 7% 
of starting weight at 12 months by following the WW 
plan focused on improving diet quality and reduc-
ing portion size.15 WW leaders advised each patient 
how many kilograms they needed to lose to achieve a 
7% weight loss.
 
► Second, to work towards achieving 150 min of moder-
ate intensity PA per week.20
In addition these activation sessions served to
 
► Motivate a commitment to change and increase indi-
viduals’ confidence in ability to change.
 
► Provide an opportunity for patients to meet others in 
a similar situation, thereby encouraging peer support, 
addressing possible stigma and reducing isolation.
 
► Teach the patients how to measure their waist circum-
ference (WC) and record their PA minutes undertak-
en.
The activation session was an interactive psychoed-
ucation group that gave an introduction to diabetes 
prevention. The sessions were facilitated by upskilled 
WW staff (who are trained lay people employed by WW 
to deliver community-based support to all members). 
Local leaders were selected as high performers in deliv-
ering WW curriculum content, who achieved good WW 
member retention and successful weight loss. Those 
leaders received specific 1-day training from a regis-
tered dietitian to gain an understanding of T2D and 
NDH and how to deliver the activation session curric-
ulum (this was in addition to the initial and ongoing 
learning and development that WW Leaders receive to 
deliver the WW program and facilitate supportive group 
meetings). A manual for the training and the activation 
session curriculum with associated patient facing mate-
rials were developed. In the activation session, patients 
learned about T2D, the meaning of NDH, how the 
condition increases risk of developing T2D and what 
patients can do to reduce their risk. The session focused 
on raising awareness of the benefits and types of life-
style changes needed to achieve and maintain a healthy

weight. It was built on patients’ existing knowledge and 
reinforced the patients’ confidence that they could make 
the changes required. Role modeling was provided by 
the WW Leaders and other group members, providing 
ongoing peer support. At the activation session, patients 
were signposted to their geographically most convenient 
WW meeting or a WW meeting of their choice. Patients 
could choose to attend any WW group session and were 
free to switch both time and location as best fitted their 
schedules. Patients were given vouchers that enabled 
them to attend for 48 weeks for free.
On attending the WW meetings, the WW plan was 
explained to the patient; program materials were 
provided and patients were given access to a WW online 
App. The WW plan is based on a Weight Loss System, 
which is a point system that creates an energy deficit 
for a healthy rate of weight loss personalized for every 
patient (based on gender, height, current weight and 
age). Dietary modifications seek to increase consump-
tion of wholegrains, vegetables and other foods that are 
high in dietary fiber, reduce the total amount of fat in the 
diet by eating less saturated fat and reduce the amount of 
refined carbohydrates consumed. Promotion of regular, 
enjoyable and convenient PA is encouraged. Their DPP 
goals of 7% weight loss and increasing activity were 
encouraged throughout.
The standard weekly WW sessions already have a core 
curriculum that uses an evidence-based lifestyle modifica-
tion program appropriate for diabetes prevention.15 This 
includes tailored advice, support and encouragement to

help patients be more physically active, eat a healthier diet, 
lose weight and maintain a healthier weight. The behav-
ioral change strategies employed within the program 
include, but are not limited to, self-monitoring strategies 
(utilizing digital-based and/or paper-based tools to track 
weight, food intake and activity), stimulus control (use of 
impulse control techniques to improve management of 
food cravings), development of weekly personal coping 
plans (for relapse prevention), problem solving, goal 
setting and strategies to garner social support. Table 1 
illustrates the WWDPP core curriculum topics addressed 
and behavior change strategies employed.
The fidelity of the intervention was maintained via 
quality assurance protocols already embedded within the 
WW organization, including visiting sessions with stan-
dardized assessments, completing spot checks that leaders 
are adhering to the curriculum, regularly tracking and 
reviewing patient outcomes, completing leader manage-
ment and training needs analysis and reviewing the 
qualitative research. All WW services were commissioned 
by the Local Authority and provided free of charge to 
patients for the duration of the study (figure 2).
data collection
Physiological baseline measures were taken by NHS 
employed GPs, nurses or healthcare assistants, who 
followed NHS standards and used authorized NHS equip-
ment (table 2). Standard NHS operating procedures 
and guidelines were followed to analyze and determine 
blood glucose via a fasting HbA1c or FPG blood glucose 
test, including diagnosing NDH, T2D and cholesterol. 
Validated sphygmomanometers are used in primary 
care to measure blood pressure (BP). The GP referral 
form (GP operating system EMIS Web) was used to refer 
patients and return blood results at 6 and 12 months. 
Weight measurements were taken by trained WW 
Leaders each week they attended using calibrated scales 
(Marsden M-560 Portable Scale) as an indicative proxy 
measure of whether they had adhered to the healthy life-
style plan that week and an opportunity for the leader 
to give feedback to the patient. WW leaders trained 
patients at the activation session on how to self-measure 
WC via the WHO STEPwise approach to Surveillance 
protocol.21 Patients were taught how to self-report PA 
minutes (patients given definition of PA for health bene-
fits; Chief Medical Officer Guidelines: Complete at least 
150 min of moderate intensity PA per week to achieve 
health benefits).20 Self-reported data were collected 
by WW coordinator every 12 weeks via telephone or 
email. Patients received additional support and motiva-
tion via telephone calls, anyone who stopped attending

was encouraged to re-engage with the program. These 
phone calls were not scripted; they were an opportunity 
to listen to the patient and provide personalized advice 
and support to stay engaged. Adherence was measured 
by attendance at the intervention.
Outcome measures
The primary outcome measures were mean change 
in HbA1c and FPG, mean weight loss (kg), mean BMI 
change and percentage body weight change at 6 and 12 
months from baseline.
Secondary outcome measures were number of sessions 
attended, incident rates of T2D, mean change in choles-
terol, cholesterol/HDL ratio, HDL, LDL, triglycerides, 
blood pressure (BP), WC and PA minutes completed at 6 
and 12 months from baseline.
statistical analysis
All baseline continuous variables were summarized by 
mean and SD, categorical variables with frequency counts 
and percentages. Analysis was performed to compare the 
risk of developing diabetes before and after the inter-
vention for patients who matched the eligibility criteria 
and attended an activation session. Analysis of treat-
ment effects measured the direction and magnitude of 
the WWDPP on all outcome variables. A linear mixed 
effect (LME) model (covariance type; autoregressive (1): 
heterogeneous) was performed to test the effect of the 
intervention on HbA1c variation at 6 and 12 months on 
an ITT basis, considering the appropriate correlation 
structure and time interaction. LME has the advantage of 
allowing adjustment for confounding and of dealing with 
missing values, whereby subjects on which observations 
are missing can still be included in the analysis. Missing 
weight data equated to 15% at 6 months (18 patients) 
and 27% at 12 months (32 patients).
Bivariate correlation analysis was carried out in order 
to examine the relationship of the independent variables 
on the main dependent variable, HbA1c at 12 months. 
All independent variables were continuous variables 
except ethnicity, gender and social deprivation which

were included as categorical variables. All models were 
adjusted for baseline BMI and weight lost at 12 months 
(kg); ethnicity and age were forced into the analysis as 
suggested by previous literature.10
A p value of <0.05 (two-sided) was considered statis-
tically 
significant. 
For 
patients 
who 
prematurely 
discontinued their follow-up visits before 12 months 
the last observation carried forward was used. IBM SPSS 
Statistical software V.23 was used for data analysis.
Results
There were 166 referrals, of which 149 met the eligi-
bility criteria. Of these, the 117 who attended an 
activation session form the study cohort. Table 3 shows 
that the study sample was primarily female (75%), white 
(90%), with 5% living in the most deprived quintile 
in the UK.22 Patients were aged on average 58 (SD ±9) 
years, which ranged from 36 to 80 years old. Baseline 
HbA1c was 43.42 mmol/mol (SD=1.28), baseline FPG 
was 6.12 mmol/L (SD=0.37), baseline weight 96.3 kg 
(SD=16.9) and BMI of 35.5 kg/m2 (SD=5.4).
Clinical, anthropometric and PA measures at base-
line, 6 and 12 months are shown in table 4. There was 
a significant reduction in HbA1c between baseline and 
6 and 12 months (p<0.01), using ITT analysis. There 
was a mean reduction in HbA1c of 2.84 mmol/mol at 
12 months (from 43.42±1.28 to 40.58±3.41). There was 
a significant reduction in FPG at 6 months but this 
failed to reach significance at 12 months. Of the 117 
patients with NDH at baseline, 44 (38%) had returned 
to normoglycemia, 18 (15%) had reduced their risk 
of T2D by reducing their blood glucose and 4 (3%) 
patients developed T2D by 12 months (figure 3). Two

patients died before the end of the study of unrelated 
causes (cancer).
At 12 months, mean weight loss was 10 kg and there was 
a mean BMI reduction of 3.2 kg/m2 (p<0.001, figure 4). 
In addition, 54% of patients achieved a greater than a 
7% reduction in body weight at 6 and 12 months, which 
defines the range in which risk reduction is evidenced to 
occur. At 6 and 12 months, respectively, 14% and 11% of 
patients reduced their body weight by more than 5% but 
less than 7%, and 32% and 35% lost less than 5% weight, 
respectively.
Among the secondary outcomes, there was an overall 
improvement in lipid levels, with significant reductions 
in triglycerides (p<0.01) and cholesterol/HDL ratio 
(p<0.05) and a significant increase in HDL cholesterol in 
males (p<0.05) at 12 months. Both systolic and diastolic 
BPs significantly improved at 12 months (p<0.01). There 
was a significant mean reduction in self-reported WC at 
12 months in both sexes. There was a mean increase in 
PA minutes at 12 months of 2 min per week (from 111 
to 113 min). Attendance at the program decreased as 
length of time on the program increased, the average 
attendance was 29 sessions out of a maximum 48 sessions, 
attended across an average of 40 weeks.
dIsCussIOn
Using an NHS GP referral pathway into a 1 year DPP deliv-
ered by this commercial weight management provider 
achieved statistically significant reductions in measures 
of T2D risk.
The WWDPP achieved a significant reduction 
in HbA1c of 2.84 mmol/mol at 12 months (from 
43.42±1.28 to 40.58±3.41, p<0.01). The results of this 
study match optimal interventions and represent clinical 
success according to the findings of PHE’s meta-analysis 
which found interventions that halt the upward trajec-
tory of blood glucose but show no overall change could 
represent considerable clinical success, while, optimal 
interventions show a reduction in HbA1c of 2 mmol/mol 
or a reduction in FPG of 0.2 mmol/L or more.10 Although 
this study evidenced a 0.2 mmol/L reduction in FPG at 
12 months, it was not statistically significant. However, 
given the potential issues with validity and reliability of 
measuring FPG, the significant HbA1c reduction may 
be considered a more reliable measure of success.23 It is 
acknowledged that not all patients at high risk go onto 
develop T2D; it is predicted that 5%–10% of people per 
year with NDH will progress to diabetes, with the same 
proportion converting back to normoglycemia.24 In this 
study, four patients (3%) developed T2D by 12 months.
The WWDPP achieved a significant mean reduction in 
weight of 10 kg and a mean reduction in BMI of 3.2 kg/
m2. PHE’s meta-analysis found that compared with usual 
care the pooled mean weight loss of optimal interventions 
resulted in a mean weight loss of 2.46 kg.10 There was a 
statistically significant mean reduction in self-reported 
WC at 12 months; abdominal adiposity is argued to be 
a stronger predictor of T2D than BMI.25 PA is important 
especially for NDH patients as PA produces positive 
secondary outcomes such as improving beta cell function, 
insulin sensitivity and preventing CVD and depression.3 
However, it is difficult for a non-exerciser to understand 
and define frequency and intensity of PA. Often when 
patients start exercising, they start to understand the 
definition of ‘moderate’ intensity and this could explain 
the large SD in activity reported.20 There were overall 
improvements in CVD risk,26 with significant reductions 
in BP (p<0.01), triglycerides (p<0.01) and cholesterol/
HDL ratio (p<0.05) and a significant increase in HDL 
cholesterol in males (p<0.05) at 12 months.
The main strength of this study was that it was successful 
in addressing the complexities of implementing preven-
tion programs in the real world; patients attended the 
program and achieved clinically significant results using 
ITT analysis. Of the eligible referrals, 77% attended the 
activation session (figure 1), while the PHE’s meta-analysis 
found that 37% of people who are eligible and referred 
will take up an intervention.10 The meta-analysis stated 
that adherence levels of 16 hours across 13 sessions over

a 9-month period is optimal for diabetes risk reduction.10 
The average compliance in this study was attendance at 
29 out of 48 sessions, attended across an average of 40 
weeks, as opposed to only 13 sessions across 9 months. 
However, there was an overall decline in attendance 
towards 12 months, and consequently the improvements 
in blood glucose and weight were not as rapid from 6 to 
12 months. Therefore, long-term follow-up is needed to 
see if the results achieved in this 12-month study would 
be realized in the longer term. Flexibility of the program 
was important; most international DPPs are curriculum 
based and use a sequential curriculum in which each 
session is only offered once, if the session is missed it is 
difficult to make it up. In the WWDPP, these specifically 
designed sessions are theme lead, based on participant 
involvement and often repeated. Sessions are hosted at 
a variety of times and widely available locations, along-
side the digital offerings. The program does not rely on 
reaching a critical mass to start and patients can attend 
any session of their choice.
A weakness of real world studies is that selection 
bias is inherent in uncontrolled, non-randomized and 
unblinded studies. In this study, there were low referral 
numbers, and therefore participation by; males, Black or 
minority ethnic (BME) groups and lower socioeconomic 
status populations. A higher proportion of the patients 
were women (75%), from white backgrounds (90%), with 
only 5% living in the most deprived quintile in the UK. It 
is likely that some of these features were because only a 
third of practices in the borough chose to participate in 
the study, and these were located in areas of lower depri-
vation and lower proportions of ethnic minorities. Due 
to ethical considerations, the study did not have a control 
group; without having a control group, it is difficult to 
assess if the significant impact on reducing diabetes risk 
was due to the WWDPP intensive lifestyle intervention 
or other variables the patient may have been exposed to. 
Therefore, consideration is needed when interpreting 
these findings to other populations. This study suffered 
from missing or inaccurate data; 32 patients’ (27%) 
weight measures and 27 patients’ (23%) blood glucose 
measures were lost to follow-up at 12 months, of which 
10 patients had no comparable baseline, for example, 
referred patient based on FPG, followed up patient using 
HbA1c measurement. GPs also referred 32 (21%) unmo-
tivated patients who did not engage in the program and 
17 (10%) ineligible patients who did not match the inclu-
sion criteria.
The Department of Health’s NHS Five Year Forward 
View strategy (2014) states that the UK will become the 
first country to implement at scale a national evidence-
based DPP.27 The evidence for reducing T2D has been 
well established for a number of years using gold stan-
dard methodology such as RCTs, control groups with 
large sample sizes.2 This study evidences how to roll out 
prevention programs in the real world utilizing existing 
referral pathways. There is a need to spread the findings 
of what works to ensure the successful delivery of the Five 
Year Forward View, at a time when public sector budgets 
are being increasingly squeezed. A strength of this study 
was that it utilized an existing GP referral pathway rather 
than expensive outreach recruitment teams or costly 
letters to patients. There are advantages to utilizing a 
UK primary care referral mechanism; the GP–patient 
relationship is important, and trust and rapport are 
viewed as enablers for patients to engage in referral 
programs.28 Primary care is best placed to refer patients; 
GPs have access to practice registers and so can identify 
retrospective NDH cohorts,29 can refer patients opportu-
nistically and via the NHS Health Checks program and 
will continue to routinely see patients. NDH and T2D 
are underdiagnosed nationally6 and still not routinely 
assessed and coded. Identifying patients within a GP 
practice for the study increased awareness, diagnosis 
and referrals. GPs provide continuity of care; there is a 
seamless transition if patients go onto develop T2D and 
patients are less likely to be lost to follow-up. The GP 
referral mechanism into the WWDPP has the potential 
to have a public health impact at a population level in a 
relatively short period of time, if scaled up. However, a 
consideration for clinicians and policymakers is how to 
engage underrepresented groups such as men, BME and 
deprived communities.
There are future research opportunities to explore 
a number of unanswered questions in relation to deliv-
ering the best DPP. An RCT to measure the effectiveness 
of different types of referral routes should be conducted, 
such as comparing direct to consumer approaches, versus 
NHS Health Check referrals or primary care referral 
mechanisms. Analysis should be undertaken to investi-
gate the most effective inclusion criteria, for example, 
what is the optimal baseline BMI or blood glucose reading 
for achieving the best results from a DPP. What cohort 
of patients is a DPP most likely to be effective for? For 
example, should BME patients, patients with complex 
mental health needs, vulnerable groups, prisoners, recent 
migrants, attend specially adapted programs? In-depth 
analysis into digital technology to prevent T2D is needed. 
In today’s digital world, research is needed to investigate 
whether patients would readily accept online delivery of 
the educational element of the lifestyle intervention and 
track their lifestyle behavior monitoring via an app.
