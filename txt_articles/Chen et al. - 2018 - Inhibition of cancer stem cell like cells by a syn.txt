Developing novel drugs that can abrogate the growth and metastasis of malignant tumors is a
major challenge for cancer researchers. Here we describe a novel synthetic retinoid, namely
WYC-209, which inhibits proliferation of malignant murine melanoma tumor-repopulating
cells (TRCs), known to resist conventional drug treatment, with an IC50 of 0.19 μM in a
dose-dependent manner. WYC-209 also inhibits proliferation of TRCs of human melanoma,
lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and breast cancer in culture. Interestingly, the treated TRCs fail
to resume growth even after the drug washout. Importantly, the molecule abrogates 87.5% of
lung metastases of melanoma TRCs in immune-competent wild-type C57BL/6 mice at 0.22
mg kg−1 without showing apparent toxicity. Pretreating the melanoma TRCs with retinoic acid
receptor (RAR) antagonists or with RAR siRNAs blocks or reduces the inhibitory effect of the
molecule, suggesting that the target of the molecule is RAR. WYC-209 induces TRC
apoptosis and pretreating the TRCs with caspase 3 inhibitor or depleting caspase 3 with
siRNAs substantially rescues growth of TRCs from WYC-209 inhibition, suggesting that
WYC-209 induces TRCs apoptosis primarily via the caspase 3 pathway. Our findings
demonstrate the promise of the new retinoid WYC-209 in treating malignant melanoma
tumors with high efficacy and little toxicity.

hemotherapy is one of the principal modes of treatment
for cancer, but resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs is a
hallmark of malignant tumors that results in major
limitation in chemotherapy1,2. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) or
tumor-initiating cells (TICs) are a self-renewing, highly tumori-
genic subpopulation of tumor cells. They play a critical role in the
initiation and progression of cancer3. CSCs or TICs exhibit high
chemo-resistance
to
conventional
chemotherapeutic
drug
treatment and therefore are speculated to be the key players in
cancer relapse after chemotherapy4. As a consequence, develop-
ing targeted chemotherapeutic drugs to abrogate CSCs or TICs is
a key task in cancer research and clinical application. We have
recently developed a mechanical method of selecting and growing
tumorigenic cells from cancer cell lines and primary cancer cells
by culturing single cancer cells in soft fibrin gels5. The selected
cancer cells display high self-renewal ability and are resistant to
chemotherapeutic drugs such as cisplatin and doxorubicin5.
Remarkably, when injected the selected cancer cells into tail veins,
as few as ten of such cells can generate distant metastatic colo-
nization in immune-competent mice. We thus functionally define
these soft-fibrin-gel-selected cancer cells as tumor-repopulating
cells (TRCs), differentiating them from CSCs or TICs that are
selected via cell surface stem cell marker approaches. These TRCs
express high levels of self-renewing gene Sox2 and low levels of
master differentiation gene Mitf and hence appear to remain
undifferentiated or partially differentiated6. Treating TRCs with
retinoid acid (RA), which is a nonspecific differentiation factor,
could inhibit TRCs extravasation7, a key late stage in metastasis.
However, poor water solubility and high toxicity of RA
significantly limit its use in clinical treatment of cancer8–11.
In
order
to
develop
highly
potent
retinoids
with
great
efficiency in inhibition of cancer stem cell like TRCs, we have
performed in-house drug discovery processes to specifically
overcome these limitations. In the current study, we describe
synthesis and discovery of a novel retinoid, named WYC-209,
which abrogates growth of TRCs of several cancer cell lines in
culture and inhibits lung metastasis by melanoma TRCs in vivo,
with little toxicity on non-cancerous cells or immune-competent
mice.
Results
Retinoid library screening and discovery of WYC-209. Retinoic
acid and its analogs, referred to as retinoids, bind retinoic acid
receptors that possess functional characteristics of a tumor sup-
pressor12. According to the clarified SARs (Structure Activity
Relationships) of synthetic retinoids, an aryl carboxylic acid right
half which that mimics RA’s terminal acid group is the most
important pharmacophore to retinoids13. However, since most
retinoids are highly lipophilic compounds with propensity to
accumulate in the human body, researchers have identified RA
analogs that substitute benzoic acid with aromatic rings; for
example, Tazarotene14 (Fig. 1a), Am80P15, and LG10026816.
Following these rationales, we have established a synthetic reti-
noid library via a parallel synthesis manner. These synthetic
retinoids were screened using the developed 3D B16-F1 TRCs
colony model5,6. One of the compounds, namely WYC-209, was a
racemic sulfoxide derivative bearing a 5-pyrimidine-acid skeleton
(MW = 368.1, Fig. 1b; Supplementary Figs. 1–5; see Methods)
with improved water solubility (Supplementary Table 1). Enan-
tiomers WYC-209A (Fig. 1c) and WYC-209B (Fig. 1d) were
prepared using Kagan’s asymmetric sulfide oxidation conditions
with Ti (Oi-Pr)4 and (+/−)-DET17 (Supplementary Figs. 1 and
6). WYC-209A acid binds human RARα, RARβ, and RARγ with
Kd of 5.3, 2.5, and 0.53 nM, respectively; WYC-209B acid binds
human RARα with Kd of 1.3 nM. These values are in the same
order of magnitude as those Kd values of all-trans retinoic acid
(ATRA) (Supplementary Table 2).
Inhibition of TRC colony growth by WYC-209. WYC-209,
WYC-209A, and WYC-209B all demonstrated excellent growth
inhibition activity for B16-F1 TRCs in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 2a–c), with 100% inhibition at 10 μM (Fig. 2d). In contrast,
at 10 μM, Tazarotene inhibited B16 growth by 71% and ATRA
inhibited B16 growth by 80% (Supplementary Fig. 7), which is
consistent with the proliferation data (Supplementary Fig. 8). The
strong inhibitory activity of WYC-209 is unexpected because it is
known that after oxidation of the sulfur atom on Tazarotene, the
sulfoxide derivative AGN 190844 loses its activity18. In addition
to its inhibitory effect on growth of B16-F1 TRCs, WYC-209 also
completely inhibited the proliferation of unselected B16-F1 mel-
anoma cells cultured on 2D rigid dishes (Supplementary Fig. 9);
in contrast, this compound showed little impact toward the non-
cancerous murine cell line 3T3 fibroblasts on rigid dishes (Sup-
plementary Fig. 10), suggesting that this compound is not toxic
for non-cancerous cells in culture. These dose-response curves
indicated that both enantiomers at 10 µM abrogated TRC growth
via inducing apoptosis of the TRCs (Supplementary Figs. 11 and
12), with IC50 of 0.15 and 0.22 μM on B16-F1 TRCs, respectively,
which were about 10-fold lower than that of Tazarotene (Fig. 2d).
Furthermore, cell cycle analyses show that WYC-209, WYC-209A
and WYC-209B decreased S phase of TRCs in a dose-dependent
manner, and at 10 μM they completely abolished S phase of
TRCs, compared with 10 μM of Tazarotene and ATRA which
could only decrease ~45% and 55% of the S phase of TRCs
(Supplementary Fig. 13). Taken together, these data suggest that
both WYC-209A and WYC-209B could abrogate proliferation of
B16-F1 TRCs in culture and induce apoptosis with similar
efficiency.
Long-term effects of WYC-209. To explore whether WYC-209
could inhibit growth of TRCs after colonies already formed, we
cultured B16-F1 cells into 3D soft fibrin gels for 3 days and then
treated the cells with WYC-209 on day 3. As shown in Fig. 3a, b,
WYC-209A, WYC-209B, and WYC-209 inhibited the growth of
TRCs in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3a, b). To explore
whether the effect of WYC-209 has any long-term effects, we
cultured B16-F1 cells into 90 Pa 3D soft fibrin gel for 3 days,
treated with WYC-209, WYC-209A, or WYC-209B, and then
washed out the compound on day 4. TRCs failed to resume
growing even 3 days after 10 µM compound washout (Fig. 3c, d;
Supplementary Fig. 14). Importantly, after 10 µM WYC-209,
WYC-209A, or WYC-209B treated melanoma TRCs were re-
plated back into new soft fibrin gels after washing out the com-
pounds in the medium, without any soluble WYC-209, WYC-
209A, or WYC-209B in the medium, none of the cells grew at all
for at least 5 days compared with the control group; the TRC
growth-blocking effects of WYC-209, WYC-209A, or WYC-209B
were dose-dependent, as there was some tumor cell growth when
the cells were pretreated with 0.1 or 1 μM of the compound that
was then washed out (Fig. 3e, f; Supplementary Fig. 15). These
results are consistent with the data that 0.1 and 1 μM compounds
did not induce TRC apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. 12) and
inhibited cell proliferation via blocking S phase of the cell cycle
(Supplementary Fig. 13). Together, our data suggest that the
effects of WYC-209, WYC-209A, or WYC-209B are long lasting
and there is no sign of “relapse” in this in vitro cell culture model.
WYC-209 abrogates growth of human TRCs. To determine
whether WYC-209 inhibitory effect could be generalized to other
types of TRCs, we examined effects of WYC-209 treatment in five

 different human cancer cell lines, including human ovarian car-
cinoma A2780, human lung adenocarcinoma A549, human breast
cancer MCF-7, human melanoma MDA-MB-435s, and human
malignant melanoma A375. WYC-209 inhibited all five types of
TRCs in a dose-dependent manner when the compound was
added on day 3 (Fig. 4a–e; Supplementary Fig. 16). Treating these
TRCs on day 0 (i.e., the compound was added at the same time
when the cells were seeded into the soft fibrin gels) also blocked
their growth in a dose-dependent manner, with IC50 ranging
from 0.10 to 0.52 μM, respectively (Supplementary Table 3).
WYC-209, WYC-209A, or WYC-209B showed better inhibitory
effect than Tazarotene and ATRA on cell growth and prolifera-
tion (Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8). All human TRCs growths
were 100% inhibited at 10 μM WYC-209 (Supplementary Fig. 17).
In addition, when human cancer cells were treated with WYC-
209 on day 3 and the compound was washed out on day 4, TRCs
failed to resume growth 5 days after the drug washout (Fig. 4f–j;
Supplementary Fig. 18). Furthermore, when the pretreated
human TRCs were isolated and re-plated back into the soft fibrin
gels after washing out the compounds in the medium, even
without any soluble WYC-209, WYC-209A, or WYC-209B in the
medium, the colony growth was inhibited in a dose-dependent
manner: partially inhibited at 0.1 or 1 μM and completely
inhibited at 10 μM (Supplementary Fig. 19). WYC-209, WYC-
209A, or WYC-209B also inhibited growth of unselected human
cancer cells on 2D rigid dishes in a dose-dependent manner and
completely blocked cell growth at 10 μM (Supplementary Fig. 20).
In contrast, these compounds showed much less inhibitory effects
towards the non-cancerous human epidermal HaCaT cells on 2D
rigid dishes and in 3D soft fibrin gels (Supplementary Fig. 21).
Together, our data suggest that WYC-209 is able to inhibit and
block growth of TRCs of both murine and human tumor cells in
culture with a long-lasting effect.
WYC-209 inhibits tumor metastasis in vivo. To determine
whether
WYC-209
is
effective
in
inhibition
of
tumor
metastasis19,20 in vivo, we injected intravenously via tail veins
30,000 B16-F1 TRCs into female immune-competent C57BL/6
mice to form lung metastases. To simulate early cancer metastasis
in human patients, we chose a 5-day waiting period after injection
of melanoma TRCs to allow for plenty of time for the malignant
TRCs to form micrometastases and to grow into metastatic
colonies in the lungs. Five days later, 0.022 or 0.22 mg kg−1
WYC-209 were intravenously injected into mice once every two
days for 25 days. 0.1% DMSO was injected as a negative control.
On day 30, all three groups of mice were sacrificed for tumor
examination since most mice from the DMSO-treated group died
(Fig. 5). Seven out of eight mice treated with DMSO formed lung
metastases; four out of eight mice formed lung metastases when
the mice were treated with 0.022 mg kg−1 WYC-209; only one out
of eight mice formed lung metastases when 0.22 mg kg−1 WYC-
209 were treated (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. 22). After treating
with 0.022 or 0.22 mg kg−1 WYC-209, the average mouse weight
was similar to that in the control group (Supplementary Fig. 23a),
suggesting that the compound did not cause weight loss in the
mice. Furthermore, the average lung weight was less in the 0.22
mg kg−1 WYC-209 treated group than that in the DMSO group
(Supplementary Fig. 23b), consistent with the data that most
lungs were tumor-free in this WYC-209 treated group. There
were no observable toxic or necrotic effects or weight loss on
organs of liver and stomach after WYC-209 treatment (Supple-
mentary Figs. 24 and 25). Similar results were observed in male
mice (Supplementary Fig. 26), suggesting that there is no gender
difference in inhibition of TRC metastasis by the compound.
To explore whether the enantiomers of WYC-209 are effective
in inhibition of tumor metastasis, we examined WYC-209A and
WYC-209B using the same protocol as WYC-209. Both WYC-
209A and WYC-209B showed effective inhibition of tumor
metastasis: all eight mice treated with DMSO formed lung
metastases; three out of eight mice formed lung metastases when
the mice were treated with 0.022 mg kg−1 WYC-209A or
WYC-209B; only one out of eight mice formed lung metastases
when 0.22 mg kg−1 WYC-209A or WYC-209B were treated

 (Supplementary Fig. 27). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining
of lung, liver, stomach, spleen, and bone confirmed the above
results and no metastases were found in any organs except the
lungs in the DMSO group and the 0.022 mg kg−1 compound
group (Supplementary Fig. 28). To explore the effects of treating
TRCs with WYC-209 in fibrin gels then injecting these cells into
untreated mice, we seeded B16-F1 cells into 3D fibrin gel, treated
with 10 µM WYC-209 or with 0.1% DMSO as control on day 3.
On day 5, TRCs were isolated and injected intravenously via tail
veins into immune-competent C57BL/6 mice at 30,000 TRCs per
mouse without any further treatment with the compound. All
eight mice formed lung metastases when they were injected with
DMSO-pretreated TRCs. In contrast, there were no lung
metastases in mice injected with WYC-209-pretreated TRCs
(Supplementary Fig. 29). Taken together, these data demonstrate
that WYC-209 is an effective drug in inhibiting lung metastases in
wild-type mice with little toxicity.
Mechanism of WYC-209 action. Retinoic acid receptor (RAR) is
presumed to function as a tumor suppressor in various contexts
since its absence is associated with tumorigenicity and its pre-
sence causes cell cycle arrest21,22. Tazarotene binds all three
members of the RAR family. As WYC-209 has a similar skeleton
to Tazarotene, we suspected that the ethyl ester of WYC-209
would be quickly hydrolyzed with esterases and its acid form
could enter the nucleus and bind to RARs. To explore this
possibility, we cultured B16-F1 into 3D soft fibrin gels and treated
them with RAR antagonists for 3 h before adding WYC-209.
Pre-treating with RARα antagonist BMS195614, or RARβ/γ
antagonist CD2665 rescued the TRC growth from the inhibitory
effects of WYC-209 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6a) and the
rescuing effect was minimal from the inhibitory effects of
Tazarotene (Supplementary Fig. 30), while adding these antago-
nists alone had no impact on TRC growth. Pre-treating with RAR
pan-antagonist AGN-194310 also rescued the TRC growth from
the inhibitory effects of WYC-209, WYC-209A, or WYC-209B in
a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. 31). Consistent
with the data of antagonists treatments, depleting RARα, RARβ,
or RARγ separately with specific siRNAs (Supplementary Figs. 32
and 33) also rescued the TRC growth from the inhibitory effects
of WYC-209 (Fig. 6b), suggesting that RARs are a primary
cellular target for WYC-209.
WYC-209 induces TRC apoptosis via caspase 3 pathway. Since
WYC-209 can abrogate TRC growth by inducing TRC apoptosis,
we explored how WYC-209 induces TRC apoptosis. It is known
that caspase 3 is an important player in apoptotic pathway23,24.
We cultured B16-F1 or A375 into 3D soft fibrin gels and treated
them with the caspase 3 inhibitor z-DEVD-FMK for 3 h before
adding WYC-209. Pretreating with z-DEVD-FMK substantially
rescued growth of mouse melanoma B16-F1 TRCs (Fig. 6c) and
human melanoma A375 TRCs (Supplementary Fig. 34) from
WYC-209 inhibition in a dose-dependent manner, but could not
rescue growth of TRCs from the inhibitory effects of Tazarotene

 (Supplementary Fig. 35). Consistent with the result of the specific
inhibitor, knocking down caspase 3 expression by siRNAs (Sup-
plementary Fig. 36) also rescued the TRCs growth from the
inhibitory effects of WYC-209 (Fig. 6d and Supplementary
Fig. 34). Furthermore, 10 μM of WYC-209, WYC-209A, or WYC-
209B led to an increase of cleaved (active) caspase-3 and PARP
(Supplementary Fig. 37). Together these results suggest that
WYC-209 induces TRC apoptosis primarily via the caspase 3
pathway.
WYC-209 exhibits little systemic toxicity. For any novel anti-
cancer compound to be useful in vivo, potential systemic toxicity
should be examined. We evaluated the potential systemic toxicity
of WYC-209 in order to determine druggability of WYC-209. The
cardiac toxicity assays towards hERG were tested in the CHO
hERG cell line using a conventional patch clamp system. The cells
were transfected with hERG cDNA and showed stable hERG
channel expression. Compared with the positive control drug
cisapride (IC50 = 15 nM), both WYC-209A and WYC-209B
showed negligible hERG channel blocking activity (IC50 > 30
μM) (Supplementary Table 4). These results suggest that both
isomers of WYC-209 were cardiacally safe at high efficacious
doses. We also evaluated the possibility of WYC-209 in inhibiting
human liver microsomes. Five representative metabolic enzymes,
including cytochromes P450 (CYP) 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and
3A4, were selected and tested with each isomer using well-
established specific inhibiting systems. As shown in Supplemen-
tary Table 5, both WYC-209A and WYC-209B exhibited no
inhibitory effects at 10 μM toward all five tested CYP enzymes.
These findings suggest that potential metabolic toxicity risks of
WYC-209 might be negligible.
Discussion
In this study, we have synthesized and identified a novel small
molecule WYC-209 that can inhibit growth of malignant mela-
noma B16-F1 TRCs in vitro and metastasis of these cells in vivo
in immune competent wild-type C57BL/6 mice. Moreover, WYC-
209 appears to have little toxic effects in cultured non-cancerous
murine 3T3 fibroblasts and in altering the physiological functions
and morphologies of organs in wild-type mice. These findings are
significant in that it is well known that many existing anti-cancer
drugs have encountered drug resistance and relapse in human
patients4,25,26. Previously, we showed that conventional che-
motherapeutic drugs such as doxorubicin and cisplatin were not
effective in inducing apoptosis of melanoma TRCs6 since
~20–30% of TRCs are not killed even at high concentrations
(1 and 100 μM) of these two drugs, suggesting that stem cell-like
TRCs might be responsible for drug resistance in malignant
melanoma cells. WYC-209 is a new retinoid discovered from the
in-house screening of a synthetic retinoid library. Inhibition of
B16-F1 TRC growth by WYC-209 is about 10 folds more potent
than that of Tazarotene and both enantiomers are highly effective.
All-trans retinoic acid is reported to inhibit acute promyelocytic
leukemia and breast cancer27 via ablation of Pin1, but toxicity8–11
and drug resistance28,29 of the molecule limit its application in
human patients. A recent report shows that an MCL1 inhibitor
S63845 is effective against several cancers with reasonable
tolerance in mice30, but it is not clear at the present time whether

 this molecule is effective against TRCs. The time-dependent
apoptosis of un-selected melanoma cells or melanoma TRCs by
WYC-209 reached ~95% 24 h after treatment, much higher than
that by Tazarotene (Supplementary Fig. 38), suggesting that
WYC-209 is much more effective in killing tumor cells than
Tazarotene. One possible role of WYC-209 and its enantiomers is
to regulate self-renewing gene Sox2 and master differentiation
gene Mitf in B16 cells6. We found that Sox2 expression decreased
by ~50% when TRCs were treated with the 10 µM compound, but
no change was observed in Sox2 when TRCs were treated with 0.1
or 1 µM compound. Mitf expression did not change when the
cells were treated with these compounds at 0.1–10 µM for 24 h
(Supplementary Fig. 39). These results suggest that WYC-209 or
their two enantiomers did not induce TRC differentiation. The
finding that WYC-209 has different impacts on the cells at 1 μM
and at 10 μM raises the possibility that WYC-209 binds to protein
targets additional to the RARs when the concentration is
increased from 1 to 10 μM. Future studies need to be carried out
to explore this possibility.
Our finding that the effect of WYC-209 is long-lasting
(>5 days) is interesting, since there is no sign of “relapse” or
growth of the TRCs in the in vitro cell culture model after single
melanoma TRCs were plated back into the soft fibrin gels with
fresh medium in the absence of the compound. These results
suggest that one might only need to deliver WYC-209 for very
limited times to animals or human subjects to abolish the growth
potential of malignant melanoma cells. However, whether the
long-lasting effect of WYC-209 on melanoma TRCs can be
extended to other types of tumorigenic tumor cells in mice or in
humans remains to be seen in the future.
The binding assay by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis
shows that WYC-209A and WYC-209B acid bind to RARs at
nano-molar doses, which are similar to their natural counterpart
ATRA, and the competition binding assay has demonstrated that
the RAR antagonists could rescue TRC growth inhibited by
WYC-209. Furthermore, all human cancer cell lines that we have
tested expressed RARs and their expression levels are positively
correlated with their sensitivity to WYC-209 (Supplementary
Fig. 40). All these data suggest that RARs might be a primary
binding target for WYC-209. These findings are supported by the
results that when RARα, β, or γ is silenced, the inhibitory effect of
WYC-209 on TRC growth is reversed. In addition, consistent
with the results that both enantiomers WYC-209A and WYC-
209B have similar efficiencies in inhibiting or abrogating growth
of melanoma TRCs, RAR antagonists reversed the inhibitory
effect of WYC-209A and WYC-209B to a similar extent (Sup-
plementary Fig. 41).
WYC-209A and WYC-209B have only one different config-
uration at the sulfur atom with different S-O bond orientation
(Fig. 1) and hence they are a pair of enantiomers. As the natural
ligand of RARs, the terminal acid group at the right end of ATRA
is the most important pharmacophore for binding to RARs. With
the help of a hydrophobic long chain, the right terminal acid
group goes deeply into the hydrophobic binding pocket and binds
to Arg269 of RAR residue, while the a,β-ionone ring part of
ATRA stays at a relatively lager space near the entrance of the
pocket. Tazarotene shares the same binding mode with ATRA
except for different hydrophobic chains and left side structures.
From their binding information, we speculate that WYC-209A
and WYC-209B may adopt similar binding modes as ATRA and
Tazarotene, and the chiral sulfur atom at the left side would not
affect their binding with RAR. Therefore it is reasonable that the
enantiomers WYC-209A and WYC-209B exhibit similar TRC
inhibition activities.
In the current study, we treated the mice with WYC-209 once
every other day after a 5-day waiting period post tumor cells
injection. During the washout assay, the inhibitory effect of
WYC-209 on TRC growth appears to be persistent for at least
5 days. Therefore, in the future the protocol for the mice
experiments might be optimized for the waiting period before
drug addition, intervals between drug injections, and doses. In the
future, it will also be of interest to examine the inhibitory effect of
WYC-209 on the metastasis of TRCs of human cancer cell lines in
nude mice or SCID mice. However, the current study has its

 strength in that wild-type and immune-competent mice are used
as the animal model for mouse melanoma metastasis to the lung
since the immune system is known to be important in limiting
tumor progression.
In summary, we have synthesized and characterized a novel
small molecule, a retinoid, which can effectively inhibit pro-
liferation of malignant TRCs of murine melanoma, human mel-
anoma, human ovarian carcinoma, human breast cancer, and
human lung adenocarcinoma in culture. This molecule can
inhibit metastasis of murine melanoma TRCs in immune-
competent mice with no apparent toxicity or side effects. In the
future it will be interesting to see if this novel retinoid can inhibit
growth and metastasis of drug-resistant malignant melanoma
cells in human subjects.
Methods
General synthesis methods. All the reactions were carried out under nitrogen or
argon with anhydrous solvents in flame-dried glassware, unless otherwise noted.
The chemicals used were reagent grade as supplied, except where noted. For details
of the synthetic procedures and the characterization data of compounds, see
Supplementary Fig. 1. For 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the compounds prepared in
this study, see Supplementary Figs. 2–5.
Synthesis of compound 3. A mixture of 6-ethynyl-4, 4-dimethylthiochroman31
(202.3 mg, 1.0 mmol), ethyl 2-chloropyrimidine-5-carboxylate15 (155 mg, 0.83
mmol), and Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 (42 mg, 0.06 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (2.0 mL)
under argon atmosphere. A mixture of CuI (19 mg, 0.1 mmol) and triethylamine
(0.3 mL) in DMF (1.0 mL) was added. The solution was heated to 75 °C for 22 h.
The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and filtered on a celite pad,
followed by washing with ethyl acetate (30 mL). The filtrate was then washed with
brine (20 mL) and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Evaporation of the
solvent under vacuum yielded the crude products, which were purified with flash
column chromatography to obtain the pure compound 3 (257 mg, 73%). 1H NMR

Synthesis of WYC-209. Compound 3 (48 mg, 0.14 mmol) was dissolved in
CH2Cl2 (3.0 mL), and the resulting solution was cooled at 0 °C. m-CPBA
(34 mg, 0.2 mmol) was added drop-wise under stirring and keeping the reaction
temperature below 5 °C. After addition, the mixture was stirred for 1 h at 0 °C and
2 h at room temperature. The m-CBA formed was removed by filtration, and the
organic phase was washed with a saturated solution of Na2S2O5 (3.0 mL) and with
a saturated solution of NaHCO3 (3.0 mL), respectively. The organic phase was
dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated, the residue was
purified with flash column chromatography to provide WYC-209 (43 mg, 83%).

Synthesis of WYC-209A. Titanium tetraisopropoxide (0.2 mmol, 58 μL) was
added rapidly to a solution of D-diethyl tartrate (82.7 mg, 0.4 mmol) in 1.0 mL of
dichloromethane at 16 °C. After 2.5 min, 10 μL of water was added slowly using a
microliter syringe with vigorous stirring for 10 min, followed by quickly cooling to
−20 °C for an additional 20 min. The reaction was allowed to take place after rapid
addition of compound 3 (69 mg, 0.2 mmol) and cumene hydroperoxide (74 μL, 0.4
mmol). After 3 h the mixture was poured to a solution of citric acid (67 mg) in a
mixed solvent of water (4 mL), l, 4-dioxane (2 mL), and diethyl ether (4 mL), and
was stirred for 15 min. The aqueous phase was extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 10
mL). The combined organic phases were stirred vigorously with 10 mL of 2 M
aqueous K2CO3 for 0.5 h. The aqueous solution was then extracted with diethyl
ether (3 × 10 mL). The combined organic solutions were washed with brine (25
mL), dried over MgSO4, and filtered. The enantiomeric excesses (ee) measurement
for the enantioselective oxidation was made with the solution, and 75% ee yielded.
Then the solution was evaporated under reduced pressure. Flash chromatography
of the crude product yielded WYC-209A (43 mg, 84%). The product was recrys-
tallized with ethyl ether for 3 times, and 99% ee product (25 mg) was obtained. All
the ee values were measured by chiral HPLC analysis: Agilent 1260 infinity HPLC,
Lux Cellulose-1 250 × 4.6 mm column, 20 °C, 254 nm,
acetonitrile/H2O = 80:20, 0.7 mL min−1, retention time 7.81 min. The fractions of
sulfoxide were mixed before enantiomeric excesses (ee) measurement.

added rapidly to a solution of L-diethyl tartrate (82.7 mg, 0.4 mmol) in 1.0 mL of
dichloromethane at 16 °C. After 2.5 min, 10 μL of water was added slowly using a
microliter syringe with vigorous stirring for 10 min, followed by quickly cooling to
−20 °C for an additional 20 min. The reaction was allowed to take place after rapid
addition of compound 3 (69 mg, 0.2 mmol) and cumene hydroperoxide (74 μL, 0.4
mmol). After 3 h the mixture was poured to the solution of citric acid (67 mg) in 4
mL of water, 2 mL of l, 4-dioxane, and 4 mL of diethyl ether, and was stirred for 15
min. The aqueous phase was extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 10 mL). The com-
bined organic phases were stirred vigorously with 10 mL of 2 M aqueous K2CO3 for
0.5 h. The aqueous solution was then extracted with diethyl ether
(3 × 10 mL). The combined organic solutions were washed with brine (25 mL),
dried over MgSO4, and filtered. The enantiomeric excesses (ee) measurement for
the enantioselective oxidation was made with the solution, and 74% ee yielded. The
solution was evaporated under reduced pressure. Flash chromatography of the
crude product yielded WYC-209B (43 mg, 84%). The product was recrystallized
with ethyl ether for three times, and 99% ee product (23 mg) was obtained. All the
ee values were measured by chiral HPLC analysis: Agilent 1260 infinity HPLC, Lux

Animals. Four-week old C57BL/6 female and male mice were obtained from the
Center of Medical Experimental Animals of Hubei Province (Wuhan, China). The
mice were randomly assigned to the control group or the treated group. As a
minimum of eight mice per group was required for having a statistical power, each
group had eight mice. The experimentalists were blinded from the expected out-
come of the treatment. All animals received humane care in compliance with the
Principles of Laboratory Animal Care Formulated by the National Society of
Medical Research and the guide for the US National Institutes of Health. The
protocol was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Huazhong
University of Science and Technology.

 groups. Since an effective assay for mycoplasma contamination is visual inspection
by imaging and DAPI-staining, all cells are counter-stained with DAPI and are
constantly monitored for mycoplasma contamination during the course of study.
Cells were cultured on rigid dishes with RPMI-1640, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium or minimum essential medium cell culture medium supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and 1% penicillin
and streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were passaged every 3–4 days using
TrypLE (Life Technologies). Cell samples were randomly allocated to each well of
the culture dishes and randomly chosen for intervention. For all cell culture
experiments, at least three independent experiments were performed per condition.
3D fibrin gel preparation. Salmon fibrinogen and thrombin were purchased from
Reagent Proteins (CA, USA). 3D fibrin gels were prepared as described pre-
viously5,6. In brief, fibrinogen was diluted into 2 mg mL−1 with T7 buffer (pH 7.4,
50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl). Cells were detached from 2D rigid dishes and cell
density was adjusted to 104 cells per mL. Fibrinogen and cell solution mixture were
made by mixing the same volume of fibrinogen solution and cell solution, resulting
in 1 mg mL−1 fibrinogen and 5000 cells per mL in the mixture fibrin gels. A
volume of 50 μL cell/fibrinogen mixture was seeded into each well of 96-well plate
and mixed well with pre-added 1 μL thrombin (100 U mL−1). The cell culture plate
was then incubated in 37 °C cell culture incubator for 10 min. Finally, 200 μL of
DMEM medium containing 10% FBS and antibiotics was added.
Apoptosis assay. Propidium iodide (PI; from Sigma) and 4′, 6-diamidino-2-
phenylindole (DAPI; from Sigma) were used to label apoptotic cells and cell
nucleus cultured in 3D fibrin gels on Day 5, respectively. Briefly, the cells cultured
in 3D fibrin gels were rinsed with pre-warmed PBS and then incubated with 10 µg
mL−1 PI and 100 ng mL−1 DAPI (pre-diluted in normal culture medium) for 1 h.
The PI-positive (apoptotic) cells and DAPI-labeled cells were imaged by DMI-
6000B fluorescence microscope.
Compounds washed out assay. Control B16-F1, A2780, A549, MCF-7, MDA-
MB-435s, and A375 cells were cultured in 90-Pa fibrin gels to form round colonies
and then treated with 0.1, 1, and 10 μM WYC-209, WYC-209A, and WYC-209B or
0.1% DMSO on day 3, which was washed out with pre-warmed PBS on day 4
with fresh medium, and then kept culturing till day 7 or day 9.
Mice experiments. Four- to six-week-old female and male C57BL/6 mice were
used in mice experiment. Mice were randomized into different groups. In metas-
tasis experiment, B16-F1 cell spheroids were selected from 3D 90-Pa fibrin gels and
pipetted to single cells. These TRCs were harvested and the cell number was
counted under microscopy. The cells were then suspended in PBS with appropriate
cell density. Thirty thousand TRCs were intravenously injected into the tail vein of
each wild-type C57BL/6 mouse. Five days later, inoculated mice were intravenous
implanted with 0.022 mg kg−1 WYC-209, 0.22 mg kg−1 WYC-209, or 0.1% DMSO
every two days. The mice were euthanized and examined for lung tumor formation
at day 30. In treated TRCs injected in vivo experiments, B16-F1 cells were seeded
into 3D 90-Pa fibrin gels and treated with 10 µM WYC-209 or 0.1% DMSO on day
3, then isolated treated TRCs colonies on day 5 and pipetted into single cell. 30,000
of TRCs were intravenously injected into the tail vein of each wild-type C57BL/6
mouse. No blinding was performed in the mice experiments.
Histologic evaluation and immunohistochemistry. Lung, liver, spleen, bone,
stomach, and brain of C57BL/6 mice were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde then were
embedded in paraffin and cut to ~4 µm thick sections by Thermo FINESSE 325.
Organ sections were stained by H&E and slides were evaluated for tumor forma-
tion by a veterinary pathologist blinded to sample identity.
Flow cytometry. For Annexin-V and PI staining to quantify cell apoptosis, treated
TRCs were isolated from 3D fibrin gel by using 5 mg mL−1 Dispase II (Sigma), cells
were labeled with FITC-conjugated Annexin-V and PI according to the manu-
facturer’s instruction (Biolegend). Data were acquired on a BD Cantoll (BD
biosciences) and analyzed with FlowJo software. For BrdU staining to quantify cell
proliferation, cells were labeled with FITC-conjugated anti-BrdU antibody
according to the manufacturer’s instruction (FITC BrdU Flow Kit, BD Biosciences)
and then data were acquired on an Accuri C6 (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with
BD Accuri C6 software.
Western blotting assay. To quantify the expression levels of RARα, RARβ, RARγ,
caspase-3, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved PARP, cells were lysed with RIPA lysis
buffer. Each sample were separated by 8–15% SDS-PAGE, blocked with 5% BSA
over night at 4 °C, and incubated with primary antibodies to RARα (1:1000,
Abcam, ab28767), RARβ (1:500, Abcam, ab53161), RARγ (1:500, Abcam,
ab97569), caspase-3 (1:1000, Cell Signal, 9662S), cleaved caspase-3 (1:1000, Cell
Signal, 9664T), or cleaved PARP (1:1000, Cell Signal, 9548T) overnight at 4 °C.
Primary antibodies were detected with mouse anti-Rabbit IgG-HRP (1:1000, Santa
Cruz, sc-2357), donkey anti-goat IgG-HRP (1:1000, Santa Cruze, sc-2020), or anti-
Mouse IgG-HRP (1:1000, Santa Cruz, sc-2005).
Growth inhibition calculation. The growth inhibition of human or murine TRCs
by WYC-209 were calculated by the formula below: Growth inhibition = 100% ×
[(Colony sizeDMSO at Day5 − Colony sizeDMSO at Day 0) − (Colony sizeWYC-209 at day5
− Colony sizeWYC-209 at Day0)]/(Colony sizeDMSO at Day5 − Colony sizeDMSO at Day 0).
MTT cell proliferation assay. Cell proliferation rate was measured by using MTT
(3-(4,5- dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) colorimetric assay
(abcam). Cells were seeded in 3D soft fibrin gel in 96-well microplates at a density
to maintain control (untreated) cells in an exponential phase of growth during the
entire experiment. Cells were incubated with various concentrations of compounds
for each time point followed by incubation with 50 µL MTT reagent (abcam) for 3
h at 37 °C. After incubation, 150 µL MTT solvent (abcam) was added and absor-
bance was measured at 570 nm. All experiments were repeated at least three times.
The percentage of viable cells was calculated and averaged for each well: percent
growth = (OD-treated cells/OD control cells) × 100, cell proliferation at each time
point is normalized to base line cell survival at the time of initial compound
treatment (day 0).
Kd quantitation using surface plasmon resonance. Surface plasmon resonance
(SPR) was carried out by Shanghai Medicilon Inc, using the Biacore 8K equipment.
Human protein RARα (ab82196), RARβ (ab82202), and RARγ (ab81922) were
purchased from Abcam (US) Ltd. Proteins were immobilized by amine coupling.
Experiments were performed at 25 °C at 30 μL min−1 with high-performance
injection and the data collected at 10 Hz. Both association and dissociation times
were 120 s. Prime into run buffer contains PBS with 0.05% P20 and 5% DMSO.
Immobilized proteins via the amine coupling procedure were diluted to
50 μg mL−1 in 10 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.0; 420 s injection time at
10 μL min−1). Compound binding was plotted in a 9-point dose–response curve
with no compound as the reference. Highest concentration was 10 μM for the
compounds. Final DMSO concentration was 5.0% for all compounds. Executed
runs included three startup injections and a 4-point solvent correction at the
beginning and the end of the run.
RNA interference. Cells were transfected with siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000
(invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Silencer Negative Control No.
1 siRNA (Invitrogen, AM4611) was used a negative control in RNA interference
experiments. The sequences of siRNAs are: UUAAAAAAAAAAAAUGGUUTT

CCCUGGACAACAGUUAUAATT for human caspase 3 #2; CCGACAAGCUU-
GAAUUUAUTT for human caspase 3 #3.
Real-time RT analysis. Total mRNA was isolated from the cells using the Trizol
reagent according to the supplier’s instruction (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription
(RT) was performed using the TransScript First-strand cDNA Synthesis SuperMix
(TransGen), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Real-time RT-PCR was
performed using GoTaq qPCR Master Mix (Promega). The data were normalized
against mouse glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The primer sequences
are as follows: mouse GAPDH (F: 5′-AGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATTTG-3′, R: 5′-
TGTAGACCATGTAGTTGAGGTCA-3′); mouse RARα (F: 5′-TCAGTGC-
CATCTGCCTCATCT-3′, R: 5′-ATGCTCCGAAGGTCTGTGATCT-3′); mouse
RARβ (F: 5′-CTGCTTGCCTGGACATCCTAAT-3′, R: 5′-CAGTCTCGGTGT-

(F: 5′-TACCAACAACCTCGGCACCAT-3′, R: 5′-GCTCCTGGCGA-
CACTGATGA-3′).
Functional hERG blocking assay for WYC-209A and WYC-209B. The hERG
blocking assays for WYC-209A and WYC-209B were evaluated in the CHO cell
line stably expressing hERG channels (Sophion Bioscience, Denmark) using
automated conventional manual patch clamp (HEKA EPC-10, Germany), while
the cisapride was used as the positive control. Whole-cell tail currents of hERG
channels were tested during the experiments at six doses (30, 10, 3, 1, 0.3, and 0.1
µM); n ≥ 2 for each dose. The IC50 values were determined with XLFit or Graphpad
Prism curve fitting software.
Cytochromes enzyme inhibition assay for WYC-209A and WYC-209B. To
evaluate the inhibitive potential of WYC-209A and WYC-209B on human liver
microsomes, five representative metabolic enzymes, including cytochromes P450
(CYP) 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4 were selected and tested with each isomer
using well-established specific inhibiting systems for each CYP enzyme. The sub-
strate drugs used for CYP 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4 were phenacetin (30 µM),

 diclofenac (10 µM), S-mephenytoin (35 µM), bufuralol (10 µM), and testosterone
(80 µM), respectively, while the control inhibitors for CYP 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6,
and 3A4 were α-naphthoflavone (0.3 µM), sulfaphenazole (10 µM), omeprazole
(100 µM), quinidine (2.5 µM), and ketoconazole (2.5 µM), respectively. After
incubation for 10, 10, 45, 10, and 5 min, respectively, the metabolic products of
these substrates were analyzed by liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry
(MS). All data were obtained from duplicate assays.
Statistical analysis. Graphpad Prism software was used for generating
Kaplan–Meier animal survival plots of 0.1% DMSO and compounds treated mice
and performing statistical analysis (using a log-rank test (Mantel–Cox)). Mice lung
metastasis experiments were analyzed by Fisher’s exact test. All other experimental
data were analyzed using a two-tailed Student’s t-test; when multiple comparisons
were carried out within a set of experiments, Bonferroni correction was also
performed.
Data availability. The X-ray crystal structures of WYC-209A and WYC-209B are
stored in Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC) with the accession
codes CCDC 1822478 and CCDC 1822479. Other data that support the findings of
this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.
