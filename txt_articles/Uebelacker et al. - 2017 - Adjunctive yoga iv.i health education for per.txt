Abstract
Background—The objective of this study was to determine whether hatha yoga is an efficacious 
adjunctive intervention for individuals with continued depressive symptoms despite antidepressant 
treatment.
Methods—We conducted a randomized controlled trial of weekly yoga classes (n = 63) vs. 
health education classes (Healthy Living Workshop, or HLW; n = 59) in individuals with elevated 
depression symptoms and antidepressant medication use. HLW served as an attention-control 
group. The intervention period was 10 weeks, with follow-up assessments 3 and 6 months 
afterwards. The primary outcome was depression symptom severity assessed by blind rater at 10 
weeks. Secondary outcomes included depression symptoms over the entire intervention and 
follow-up periods, social and role functioning, general health perceptions, pain, and physical 
functioning.
Results—At 10 weeks, we did not find a statistically significant difference between groups in 
depression symptoms (b=−0.82, SE=0.88, p=0.36). However, over the entire intervention and 
follow-up period, when controlling for baseline, yoga participants showed lower levels of 
depression than HLW participants (b = −1.38, SE = 0.57, p = 0.02). Fifty-one percent of yoga 
participants demonstrated a response (≥ 50% reduction in depression symptoms) at 6 month-
follow-up, compared to 31% of HLW participants (OR = 2.31; p = 0.04). Yoga participants 
showed significantly better social and role functioning and general health perceptions over time.

 Conclusions—Although we did not see a difference in depression symptoms at the end of the 
intervention period, yoga participants showed fewer depression symptoms over the entire follow-
up period. Benefits of yoga may accumulate over time.
Introduction
The goal of depression treatment is to help individuals achieve symptomatic remission and 
normal functioning. However, partial and non-response to existing treatments, such as 
antidepressant medications, remains a significant problem. For example, in a large, 
naturalistic study of depression treatment in which 77% of participants received “adequate” 
or “aggressive” pharmacotherapy, 46% of participants were classified as non-responders 
after 6 months, and 32% were considered to have responded but not remitted (Corey-Lisle et 
al., 2004). Similarly, in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression trial, 
the remission rate after initial antidepressant treatment was 37%, and the cumulative 
remission rate with up to four successive treatment steps was 67% (Rush et al., 2006). Thus, 
there is a need to test innovative adjunctive interventions to further improve outcomes in this 
group of patients who do not fully respond to traditional treatments.
Yoga is an ancient Indian system of philosophy and practice (Iyengar, 1993). Approximately 
5% of U.S. adults practice yoga (Barnes et al., 2004). Most practice hatha yoga, which 
involves training the body with the ultimate goal of promoting good physical and mental 
health. Hatha yoga includes breath control (pranayama), physical postures (asanas), and 
meditation (dhyana). Hatha yoga can combine mindfulness practice (i.e., non-judgmental 
attention to present-moment experience) and physical activity in a way that is internally 
consistent. Increased mindfulness may improve depression by reducing rumination, 
increasing self-compassion, or promoting the view that thoughts and feelings are transitory 
cognitive contents rather than self-defining (i.e., meta-cognitive awareness) (van der Velden 
et al., 2015). Exercise has been demonstrated helpful for depression as well (Cooney et al., 
2013).
A recent meta-analysis of 12 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of yoga for clinical 
depression reported yoga was significantly better than usual care, relaxation exercises, or 
aerobic exercise in decreasing depressive symptoms (Cramer et al., 2013). Yoga may also 
improve physical health outcomes comorbid with depression, particularly pain. However, 
studies of yoga for depression have numerous methodologic limitations, including small 
sample sizes, lack of assessment of instructor fidelity to the yoga protocol, lack of outcome 
assessment by blind raters, lack of intent-to-treat analyses, and insufficient documentation of 
randomization procedures (Uebelacker et al., 2016).
The purpose of this study is to examine whether hatha yoga is efficacious for depression 
when used as an adjunct to antidepressant treatment. We enrolled individuals with current or 
recent major depression who were receiving antidepressant medication and continued to 
have elevated depressive symptoms. We randomized participants to participate in yoga 
classes vs. an attention control group (i.e., a health education class entitled Health Living 
Workshop; HLW). We encouraged all participants to continue to take their antidepressant 
medications. The intervention phase lasted 10 weeks; participants were then followed for 6

 months afterwards. We hypothesized that yoga participants would show lower depression 
severity over time as assessed by the Quick Inventory of Depression Symptomatology – 
Clinician Rating (QIDS) (Rush et al., 2003), as well as better social and role functioning, 
better general health perceptions and physical functioning, and less physical pain relative to 
the control group. A priori, the 10-week QIDS assessment was designated as the primary 
outcome.
Methods
The Institutional Review Board of Butler Hospital approved the study. All study activities 
occurred at the hospital, which is a psychiatric hospital in Providence, RI. We recruited 
participants from the greater Providence area from July 2011–June 2014, and some 
participants were active in the study until March 2015. Participants were not required to be 
receiving any other psychiatric treatment at the hospital, and most were not. Advertisements 
presented study interventions with equipoise, using the rationale that both yoga and HLW 
were designed to promote good physical and mental health.
Interested individuals underwent a telephone screen and, if potentially eligible, attended an 
in-person interview (Baseline 1) where they provided written informed consent, completed 
interviews to determine eligibility, and completed other assessments. Subsequently, study 
staff requested medical clearance from the participant’s primary care provider. Once staff 
received clearance, a research assistant called the participant (Baseline 2), administered a 
QIDS by telephone, and randomized the participant.
We randomized participants to groups using a 1:1 ratio with a computer program that 
employed urn randomization (Stout et al., 1994). We stratified participants on three 
variables: depression severity (QIDS ≤ 10 vs. QIDS ≥ 11), current psychotherapy with visits 
more often than once per month (yes or no), and gender. Study staff had no way of knowing 
to which arm the next participant would be randomized.
Subsequent to randomization, participants were enrolled in the intervention phase of the 
study for 10 weeks and then in the follow-up phase of the study for 6 months. During the 
intervention phase, participants were invited to attend classes in their assigned arm. The 
follow-up phase included assessment only. Staff attempted to contact all participants for all 
assessments regardless of whether they were attending classes.
Participants
Inclusion criteria were: 1) met criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) within the prior 
two years assessed via the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID; First et al., 
2001); 2) QIDS score ≥ 8 (mild depression) and ≤ 17 (moderately severe depression); 3) no 
history of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or psychotic symptoms, assessed via the SCID; 4) 
no current hazardous drug or alcohol use assessed using the Alcohol Use Disorder 
Identification Test and Drug Used Disorders Identification Test (Babor et al., 2001, Berman 
et al., 2005); 5) no suicidal ideation or behavior requiring immediate attention; 6) currently 
taking an antidepressant at a dose with demonstrated effectiveness per American Psychiatric 
Association practice guidelines (Work Group on Major Depressive Disorder, 2010) for at

 least 8 weeks; 7) antidepressant dose had not changed in the previous 4 weeks and no plans 
to change the dose in the next 10 weeks; 8) if in psychotherapy, therapy frequency had not 
changed in the past 6 weeks AND no plans to change it in the next 10 weeks; 9) medically 
cleared for moderate physical activity; 10) not pregnant or planning to become pregnant; 11) 
no more than 4 yoga, tai chi, Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction or health education 
classes or home practice sessions in the previous year, no more than 8 yoga classes in the 
previous 2 years, and had not practiced yoga weekly for 8 weeks or more in the previous 5 
years; 12) no weekly meditation practice; 13) fluent in English; and 14) aged 18 or older.
Interventions
Yoga—Based on expert opinion (authors TG and GT; also Weintraub, 2004), feedback from 
pilot research participants (Uebelacker et al., 2010b), and existing literature, we developed a 
manualized hatha yoga program. Each participant received an introductory 20–30 minute 
individual meeting with a yoga instructor. We offered group classes twice per week; 
participants were expected to attend at least one class per week with the option of attending 
two per week for 10 weeks. Classes were 80-minutes. Classes included breathing exercises 
(pranayama) and seated meditation; warm-ups and half sun salutations; standing postures 
(asanas); seated postures; an inversion and a twist; shavasana (relaxation); and wrap-up and 
discussion of home practice. Instructors had a list of asanas and other practices from which 
they chose. Similar to many community classes, classes accommodated rolling admission. 
Instructors were asked to encourage mindful attention to the present moment throughout 
class, and to repeatedly guide participants through the connection between breath and 
movement. Instructors tailored the pace of class to the participants present; generally, the 
class occurred at a gentle pace. To facilitate home practice, we gave each participant a yoga 
mat, descriptions of suggested practices, two videos featuring study instructors, and a 
commercial yoga DVD (LifeForce Yoga® to Beat the Blues – Level1 by Amy Weintraub).
All yoga instructors were Registered Yoga Teachers ® with the Yoga Alliance. Yoga 
instructors also received study-specific training. Using audiorecordings and a structured tool, 
yoga supervisors Dr. Tremont and Mr. Gillette rated a subset of 55 classes throughout the 
duration of the study for instructor manual fidelity. Fidelity was excellent for class content 
(mean fidelity = 95%) and teaching style (mean fidelity= 94%). Yoga instructors met 
monthly for peer consultation. Yoga supervisors provided feedback about any observed 
manual deviations.
Healthy Living Workshop (HLW)—Group HLW classes were concurrent with yoga 
classes. Instructors used a detailed manual adapted from previous work with psychiatric 
patients and smokers (Abrantes et al., 2014, Abrantes et al., 2012). HLW included an initial 
individual orientation meeting between the instructor and participant. Subsequently, 
participants were invited to attend at least one and up to two HLW classes per week for 10 
weeks. Classes were 60 minutes long. Instructors followed a detailed manual. There were 20 
different class topics that repeated every 10 weeks. Topics included: alcohol, nicotine, and 
caffeine; being a smart patient; brain diseases; cancer prevention; diabetes; nutrition (3 
classes); germs, colds, and the flu; physical activity (2 classes); sleep; physical pain, 
prevalence and causes of depression; and protecting your heart. Classes included slides,

 audio or video clips, and demonstrations. Classes were interactive, but instructors avoided 
focusing on personal problems of participants. To facilitate home learning, we gave each 
participant a book about nutrition, handouts at each class, and lists of websites with relevant 
information. Instructors encouraged participants to read materials each week at home.
HLW instructors were post-doctoral fellows in clinical psychology and a master’s level 
nurse, with supervision by Dr. Abrantes. Using audiorecordings and a structured tool, Dr. 
Abrantes and a trained research assistant rated a subset of 53 classes for instructor manual 
fidelity. Fidelity was excellent for both class content (mean fidelity= 97%) and teaching 
style (mean fidelity = 95%). HLW instructors met monthly for peer consultation.
Assessments
Assessment schedule—Assessments occurred at Baseline 1 (eligibility assessment), 
Baseline 2 (randomization), 3.3 weeks, 6.6 weeks, and 10 weeks (endpoint of intervention 
phase). Baseline 1 and 2 were a mean of 7.6 (SD =4.5) days apart. Follow-up assessments 
occurred 3 months and 6 months after endpoint. The Baseline 2 assessment and 3- and 6-
month follow-up assessments occurred by telephone; participants returned self-report 
instruments by mail at these assessments.
Diagnoses—To assess psychiatric diagnoses, we used the Structured Clinical Interview for 
DSM-IV (SCID; First et al., 2001). Raters included PhD level psychologists and a trained 
research assistant who reviewed ratings with a psychologist.
Primary outcome—We assessed the primary outcome, depression symptom severity, 
using the Quick Inventory of Depression Symptomatology – Clinician Rating (QIDS; Rush 
et al., 2003) at all assessment timepoints. Scores of 6–10 reflect mild depression symptoms; 
11–15 reflect moderate depression symptoms, and scores 16 or greater reflect severe or very 
severe symptoms. QIDS interviewers were trained research assistants blind to treatment 
assignment. Participants were instructed not to reveal their intervention assignment to 
interviewers. We assessed reliability of interviews by having a second rater rate a random 
selection of 61 interviews; reliability was excellent (ICC = 0.96). Versions of the QIDS have 
been administered by telephone in previous trials (Rush et al., 2005, Wang et al., 2007) and 
the telephone version shows good psychometrics and concordance with self-reports of 
depression symptoms (Rush et al., 2005)
Secondary outcomes—We used the Patient Health Questionnaire- 9 item (PHQ-9; 
Kroenke et al., 2001) to assess self-report of depressive symptoms. Scores range from 0–27, 
with higher scores corresponding to more symptoms. We used the physical functioning, 
bodily pain, and general health perceptions subscales from the 20-item Short-Form Survey 
(SF-20; Ware et al., 1993). Scores range from 0–100, with higher scores indicating better 
health. We administered the PHQ-9 and SF-20 at all timepoints except Baseline 2. We used 
two subscales from the World Health Organization – Disability Assessment Schedule 
(WHO-DAS II; World Health Organization, 2004): the “Getting along with people” subscale 
(social functioning) and “Life activities” subscale (work and role functioning). Scores range 
from 0–20 on “Getting along with people” and 0–32 on “Life activities,” with higher scores

 indicating more disability. We administered the WHO-DAS-II at Baseline 1, 10 week 
intervention endpoint, and 3 and 6 month follow-up timepoints.
We defined depression “response” as a decrease of 50% or greater on the QIDS from 
Baseline 1 to follow-up. We defined “remission” as a QIDS score of ≤ 5 (no depression 
symptoms). We assessed response and remission at 10 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months.
Other assessments—We assessed demographics via self-report. For race, we asked 
participants to choose as many as applied from a list of options. We assessed amount of 
physical activity with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ; Craig et al., 
2003). IPAQ data were used to calculate metabolic equivalent of task (MET) minutes per 
week (IPAQ Research Committee, 2005) over the previous week. We added questions to the 
IPAQ to assess amount of time spent in yoga practice either in class or at home; these were 
not used in the MET score calculation. We administered the modified IPAQ at all assessment 
points except Baseline 2. We assessed adverse events every 3 weeks during the intervention 
phase with a single question about injuries related to study participation, and at 10 weeks 
with the Systematic Assessment of Treatment-Emergent Events, General Inquiry (SAFTEE-
GI; Levine & Schooler, 1986).
Statistical methods
Baseline characteristics, class attendance, minutes of yoga per week, and 
other treatment during study participation—We summarized variables using 
descriptive statistics, and compared differences between treatment groups (Yoga vs. HLW) 
using either a X2 test or t-test.
Continuous outcome variables—As a general strategy, we included outcome 
assessments from all randomized participants in linear mixed effects (LME) models 
assessing continuous outcomes with a dummy coded index included in each model to 
represent treatment assignment. Because participants with missing covariates (n =5) or less 
than two follow-up assessments for the primary outcome (n = 10) would be removed from 
LME models, we used a multiple imputation approach (van Buuren & Groothuis-
Oudshoorn, 2011) to ensure inclusion of all allocated cases (n= 122). Our data analytic 
strategy involved multiple imputation (m= 50) of missing values with multivariate 
imputation by chained equations using all independent, dependent, and covariate terms in 
the multiple estimations of missing values
The baseline value for the outcome variable was not included as part of the dependent 
variable; rather, the baseline value was included as a covariate. Thus, a significant main 
effect for the treatment assignment variable indicates significant differences between groups 
in average score on the outcome variable across all non-baseline timepoints (i.e., weeks 3.3., 
6.6., 10 (endpoint), and 3 and 6-month followup), demonstrating that treatment assignment 
(Yoga vs. HLW) has a significant impact on that outcome while controlling for the baseline 
value of that outcome. We also tested models that included a group × time interaction. 
Planned covariates included age, gender, and time. We included as covariates baseline values 
of general health perceptions and level of physical activity given the potential for influence 
on physical aspects of yoga practice.

 Our a priori hypotheses for group differences in QIDS at the end of treatment was tested 
using multiple imputation and a regression model with 10-week QIDS score as the 
dependent variable and covariates including baseline QIDS and other covariates described 
above. As an index of effect size, we computed between-group effect sizes in standard 
deviation units (Feingold, 2009).
Consistent with previous studies, limitations in physical functioning (i.e. the SF-20 physical 
functioning scale) were counted regardless of duration and were scored to reflect the number 
of limitations present (Stewart et al., 1981). Thus, for this variable, we used a negative 
binomial mixed effects model because it provided the best fit to the skewed data.
Categorical outcome assessments—We included outcome assessments from all 
participants with relevant follow-up data (i.e., with data at 10 weeks, 3 months, or 6 months) 
in linear mixed effects (LME) models assessing continuous outcomes and generalized LME 
assessing categorical outcomes (i.e. response, remission). We included baseline QIDS as a 
covariate. We did not use multiple imputation for these models.
Statistical package—All analyses were conducted using R 3.2 (R Core Team, 2015) and 
tools within the nlme (Pinheiro et al., 2015), lme4 (Bates et al., 2015), and mice (van Buuren 
& Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011) packages.
Power—Power analyses were based on a priori determinations of minimally clinically 
significant differences. Using recommendations on depression from the National Institute for 
Clinical Excellence in the UK (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, 2007) 
and descriptions of effect size (Cohen, 1988), we set a minimum clinically significant 
difference for depression treatments at an effect size of d = .40 (approximately 2–3 points 
difference on the QIDS). Using an empirical power analysis, we found that, assuming a 
group size of 75 (including a 20% dropout rate), and setting alpha at .05, we would have 
>80% power to detect an effect of d= .40 at endpoint. However, we were ultimately only 
able to recruit 122 participants during the funding period.
Results
Cohort
We recruited 122 participants and allocated 63 participants to yoga and 59 to HLW (Figure 
1). Table 1 shows demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline. Almost two thirds of 
our sample had chronic major depression. Average depression severity was in the moderate 
range. Participants reported, on average, a moderate level of physical activity (IPAQ 
Research Committee, 2005). Table 1 also provides information about baseline values of 
outcome variables, including means and standard deviations. There were no significant 
differences between groups on baseline variables.
Other treatment during the study
At the 10-week, 3-month, and 6-month assessment timepoints, 95%–100% of participants 
reported that they continued to take an antidepressant medication, and approximately 40%

 reported engaging in psychotherapy. There were no significant differences between 
intervention arms on either variable (all p-values > 0.25). Please see Supplementary Table 1.
Adherence and yoga “dosage”
Yoga participants attended a mean of 8.9 classes (SD = 5.1) throughout the 10 week 
intervention phase; HLW participants attended an average of 7.0 classes (SD = 5.7; t(120) = 
1.88, p = .06). As a manipulation check, we examined minutes per week engaged in yoga 
(either in a class or at home) in both arms in the intervention phase. As expected, the average 
total time practicing yoga was significantly higher in the yoga arm than in the HLW arm 
during the intervention phase (i.e., at weeks 3.3, 6.6, and 10; all p-values < 0.001). In the 
yoga arm, mean minutes practicing yoga per week ranged from 113–123 (SDs ranging from 
76–170 minutes), whereas in the HLW arm, mean minutes practicing yoga per week ranged 
from 1–5 (SDs ranging from 5–27). There was a consistent difference between groups 
during the follow-up phase as well. At 3 months, average minutes of yoga practice per week 
was 36 mins (SD =74 mins) and 2 mins (SD =10 mins) in the yoga arm and HLW arm, 
respectively (t(91) =−2.98, p = .004). At 6 months, average minutes of yoga practice per 
week was 34 mins (SD =64 mins) and 2 mins (SD =11 mins) in the yoga arm and HLW arm, 
respectively (t(89) = −3.29, p = .001).
Outcomes
First, we conducted an analysis of group differences in change in the primary outcome 
(QIDS) at week 10. There was no significant difference between groups at this assessment 
point (b=−0.89, SE=0.85, p=0.30). Average change in QIDS was −3.15 (SD=5.09) and 
−3.93 (SD=3.90) for HLW and Yoga conditions respectively. To estimate effect size, we 
divided the difference between groups in average change in QIDS by the raw standard 
deviation of the baseline QIDS. This yielded an effect size of 0.29, favoring the yoga arm. 
This is a small-to-medium effect size (Cohen, 1988).
When we examined QIDS scores over the entire intervention and follow-up period while 
adjusting for baseline QIDS, we did observe a significant difference between groups, with 
yoga participants demonstrating lower depression severity than HLW participants (Table 2). 
On average across all (non-baseline) timepoints, the difference between groups was 
approximately one half of one standard deviation– a medium effect size (Cohen, 1988). The 
treatment by time interaction was not significant (b= −0.041, SE=0.03, p=0.17), indicating 
that there was no significant difference between the non-baseline timepoints in the 
magnitude of the difference between groups. See figure 2 for a graphical depiction of QIDS 
scores over time.
Similarly, we observed a statistically significant difference between arms across non-
baseline timepoints for self-rated depressive symptoms, with yoga participants showing 
lower PHQ-9 scores (Table 2) on average across the intervention and follow-up phase. Social 
functioning, work and role functioning, and general health perceptions were also better in 
the yoga arm across non-baseline timepoints, adjusting for baseline. We did not observe 
differences between groups in physical functioning or pain. Group X time interactions were 
not statistically significant and therefore not included in final models.

 Table 3 includes the percentage of participants who met criteria for response or remission. 
There were significantly higher odds of treatment response for yoga (vs HLW) across 3- and 
6-month follow-up assessments. There was not a statistically significant difference in the 
odds of participants in yoga compared to HLW meeting criteria for full remission.
There were no serious adverse events related or possibly related to study procedures in either 
study arm.
Discussion
A recent meta-analysis demonstrated efficacy of yoga for the treatment of depression 
(Cramer et al., 2013). We did not replicate the acute treatment effect documented in this 
meta-analysis. There are several possible reasons. First, much of the prior work was limited 
by significant methodological weaknesses, as described in the introduction and in previous 
work (Cramer et al., 2013, Uebelacker et al., 2010a). The current study was designed to 
address these weaknesses. Second, in the current study, we focused on a potentially difficult 
to treat group of participants, i.e., people with persistent depressive symptoms despite 
antidepressant treatment. No prior studies of yoga for depression focused on a comparable 
group. Third, we employed a control group that was matched for time and controlled for 
non-specific factors such as scheduled time to focus on one’s own health, an opportunity to 
leave one’s home, and social support from both an instructor and from peers with 
depression. This is a more rigorous control than frequently-employed control conditions 
such as minimal treatment or treatment-as-usual. Consistent with our findings at end-of-
intervention (10 weeks), Cramer et al. reported that although they found various styles of 
yoga to be superior to usual care, relaxation, and aerobic exercise in their meta-analysis, 
single trials failed to show that yoga was superior to some of the more active control groups 
such as group therapy, a social support group, massage, or pharmacological treatment.
Although we did not see an acute treatment effect in the current study, we did find that 
participants who had received yoga showed lower levels of depression, improved general 
health perceptions, and improved social and work and rule functioning over the entire 
follow-up period. They were also more likely to show a treatment response at 3-months and 
at 6-months. That is, it appears that yoga had an enduring effect when compared to health 
education. This is particularly notable given the rigorous control group and the focus on a 
difficult-to-treat population. In our yoga intervention, teachers did repeatedly focus on the 
importance of and options for home practice. This was reinforced by the fact we gave 
participants materials and tools for home practice. Thus, we hypothesize that yoga taught 
participants skills for coping with depressed mood and cognitions, and, as they continued to 
practice these skills even outside of class, the beneficial effects accumulated over time. 
Similarly, data suggest that cognitive behavioral therapy is more likely to prevent relapse 
than medications after an acute treatment period, perhaps because the therapy teaches 
patients a different way to relate to negative cognitive content even when they are no longer 
in therapy (Bockting et al., 2015).
In this study, at 3-month and 6-month follow-up assessments, the odds ratios for response to 
yoga vs. HLW were 2.01 and 2.31. These odds ratios compare favorably to those obtained in 
Uebelacker et al.

 a meta-analysis of 2–14 weeks of pharmacological augmentation strategies for people with 
treatment resistant depression (Zhou et al., 2015). Augmentation with aripirazole or 
quetiapine was demonstrated to be superior to placebo for treatment-resistant depression, 
with odds ratios of 1.85 and 1.92, respectively, although it is unknown if the response rate be 
diminished, the same, or increased with a longer-term follow-up more similar to the follow-
up in the current study. It is notable that these medications were less well-tolerated than 
placebo (Zhou et al., 2015), with significant negative side effects. Although there is a risk of 
physical injury with yoga – as with any type of physical activity – there is no evidence that 
yoga causes weight gain or other serious side effects associated with atypical antipsychotics. 
Therefore, hatha yoga may be a more acceptable option for some patients.
A limitation of this study is the predominantly female sample. Although women are more 
likely than men to experience major depression (Kessler et al., 2003), women are 
disproportionately represented in our sample. It is possible that the interventions appealed 
more to women than to men. Women are more likely to engage in mind-body therapies in 
the community than men (Barnes et al., 2004). Another limitation of this study is that most 
participants were white and non-Latino. There may be cultural differences in who finds yoga 
acceptable. However, researchers have had success recruiting non-white and Latino 
participants (Dutton et al., 2013, Roth & Robbins, 2004) for a related intervention, 
Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction. Finally, as with all behavioral interventions, we were 
unable to keep participants blind to treatment assignment, although we did make efforts to 
present both arms to participants with equipoise.
There are several areas for future research. One of the key questions is how much yoga each 
week, and over what period of time, is needed to cause a clinically significant change in 
depression symptoms. At the dosage we provided in the intervention phase, 10 weeks may 
not have been enough. However, we did see important differences over longer periods of 
time. Second, what are the moderators and mediators of the impact of yoga on depression? 
Understanding of mechanisms may contribute to answering yet another question: what are 
the active ingredients of yoga that have an impact on depression? There are many styles of 
hatha yoga available in the community; classes can be gentle or vigorous, can differentially 
emphasize postures, breathing, and meditation, and can include or not include teaching on 
yoga philosophy. In this study, we provided a balanced hatha yoga class that emphasized 
breathing and postures and was suitable for people who may not be physically fit. However, 
in order to make the recommendation that a depressed patient engage in yoga, clinicians and 
patients will need to know what to look for in the variety of yoga classes available.
This is the largest study of yoga for depression to date. Using rigorous methodology, we did 
not see differences between groups at 10 weeks. However, yoga was superior to our control 
group when we examined outcomes 3- and 6-months after the intervention period, thus 
suggesting that the impact of participating in yoga may grow and endure over time. Effective 
and tolerable adjunctive treatments, such as yoga, are clearly needed to address the high 
symptom burden among individuals with partial response to conventional treatments.

cAll participants had a current episode of major depression or an episode in the previous 2 years. To assess whether their depression would be considered chronic, after assessing the depressive episode, we 
asked whether they had experienced depressed mood and other symptoms discussed for at least 2 years, more than half the days, with no more than 2 months of feeling okay.

Note. Because baseline is included as a covariate and NOT included as part of the dependent variable, the “Group: Yoga vs. HLW” parameter 
represents differences between groups at all non-baseline timepoints, adjusted for the baseline score. A statistically significant difference on this 
parameter indicates that the study arm (Yoga vs. HLW) has a significant impact on that outcome. We also tested models that included interactions 
between time and group for each of the outcome variables. These interaction terms were not statistically significant for any of the outcomes. Thus, 
the magnitude of the difference between groups was not statistically significantly different across the non-baseline timepoints.
IPAQ = International Physical Activity Questionnaire. PHQ-9 = Patient Health Questionnaire, 9 item. QIDS = Quick Inventory of Depression 
Symptomatology. SF-20 = 20-item Short-Form Survey. WHO-DAS = World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule.
aFor the physical functioning subscale, we reversed the scale (so that higher values = poorer functioning) prior to analysis in order to fit a negative 
binomial mixed effects model.

Note. Generalized LME with adjustment for covariates and baseline QIDS supported a significantly higher odds of treatment response for yoga vs HLW (adjusted OR = 2.46, 95%CI=1.12–5.37, p=0.03) 
across end-of-treatment and 3- and 6-month follow-up assessments. Generalized LME evaluation did not support a statistically significant difference in the odds of participants in yoga compared to HLW 
meeting criteria for full remission (adjusted OR=1.88, 95%CI=0.88–4.02, p=0.10)
QIDS = Quick Inventory of Depression Symptomatology.
