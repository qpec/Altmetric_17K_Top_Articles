The impact of surgery on global climate: a carbon footprinting 
study of operating theatres in three health systems
Andrea J MacNeill, Robert Lillywhite, Carl J Brown
Summary
Background Climate change is a major global public health priority. The delivery of health-care services generates 
considerable greenhouse gas emissions. Operating theatres are a resource-intensive subsector of health care, with 
high energy demands, consumable throughput, and waste volumes. The environmental impacts of these activities are 
generally accepted as necessary for the provision of quality care, but have not been examined in detail. In this study, 
we estimate the carbon footprint of operating theatres in hospitals in three health systems.
Methods Surgical suites at three academic quaternary-care hospitals were studied over a 1-year period in Canada 
(Vancouver General Hospital, VGH), the USA (University of Minnesota Medical Center, UMMC), and the UK (John 
Radcliffe Hospital, JRH). Greenhouse gas emissions were estimated using primary activity data and applicable 
emissions factors, and reported according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. 
Findings Site greenhouse gas evaluations were done between Jan 1 and Dec 31, 2011. The surgical suites studied were 
found to have annual carbon footprints of 5 187 936 kg of CO2 equivalents (CO2e) at JRH, 4 181 864 kg of CO2e at UMMC, 
and 3 218 907 kg of CO2e at VGH. On a per unit area basis, JRH had the lowest carbon intensity at 1702 kg CO2e/m2, 
compared with 1951 kg CO2e/m2 at VGH and 2284 kg CO2e/m2 at UMMC. Based on case volumes at all three sites, 
VGH had the lowest carbon intensity per operation at 146 kg CO2e per case compared with 173 kg CO2e per case at JRH 
and 232 kg CO2e per case at UMMC. Anaesthetic gases and energy consumption were the largest sources of greenhouse 
gas emissions. Preferential use of desflurane resulted in a ten-fold difference in anaesthetic gas emissions between 
hospitals. Theatres were found to be three to six times more energy-intense than the hospital as a whole, primarily due 
to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning requirements. Overall, the carbon footprint of surgery in the three 
countries studied is estimated to be 9·7 million tonnes of CO2e per year.
Interpretation Operating theatres are an appreciable source of greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions reduction 
strategies including avoidance of desflurane and occupancy-based ventilation have the potential to lessen the climate 
impact of surgical services without compromising patient safety.

Introduction
Climate change represents one of the greatest health 
threats of the 21st century.1,2 To avoid a global temperature 
rise beyond 2°C and the projected climate disturbances 
that will ensue, all industries must develop strategies to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The health sector is 
one of the largest service industries and its carbon 
footprint is considerable. In the USA, the health-care 
system generates 8–10% of all greenhouse gas 
emissions,3,4 and in the UK the National Health Service 
(NHS) is responsible for 25% of public sector emissions.5
Surgery is a resource-intensive health-care activity, 
requiring expensive equipment, sterilisation procedures, 
advanced operative technologies, and obligatory life 
support systems. These activities use considerable 
amounts of energy and consumables, and generate 
copious waste volumes. Whereas the climate impacts 
associated with surgery are generally accepted as 
necessary for the provision of quality care, they have not 
been rigorously quantified or subject to crucial evaluation.
In this study, we examine the carbon footprint of 
surgical suites in three hospitals from different health-
care systems (Canada, the USA, and the UK). The 
objectives were to identify and measure components of 
the operating theatre carbon footprint, to compare 
institutional practices, and to formulate recommendations 
to minimise the impact of surgery on global climate.
Methods
Background and site descriptions
Institutional consent for participation was obtained from 
administrators at three hospitals: Vancouver General 
Hospital (VGH; Vancouver, BC, Canada); University of 
Minnesota Medical Center (UMMC; Minneapolis, MI, 
USA); and John Radcliffe Hospital (JRH; Oxford, UK). All 
are academic, quaternary-care centres with over 800 beds 
and high-volume surgical suites encompassing a full 
range of specialist services. The three sites had comparable 
numbers of operating theatres (22 at VGH, 21 at UMMC, 
and 24 at JRH) although overall surgical suite size varied

(1650 m² at VGH, 1450 m² at UMMC, and 3049 m²J at 
JRH) as a result of differences in theatre design. JRH was 
constructed with separate anaesthetic induction rooms for 
improved efficiency which, in combination with other 
structural and process differences, resulted in higher 
throughput compared with the other sites despite a 
similar number of theatres (30 000 cases annually vs 18 000 
at UMMC and 22 000 at VGH). The surgical suites at 
VGH and UMMC were both constructed in 1996. Adult 
surgical services at JRH are divided between two blocks of 
operating theatres in different hospital wings, one built in 
1979 and the other in 2006.
A comprehensive greenhouse gas inventory was 
performed according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol,6 
with slight modifications as described below. The surgical 
suite was defined as the sum of a hospital’s operating 
theatres, surrounding corridors, and sterile core, 
inclusive of anaesthetic and equipment rooms, but 
exclusive of pre-operative and post-operative holding and 
recovery areas, administrative offices, and medical device 
reprocessing departments.
The Greenhouse Gas Protocol defines three scopes of 
emissions for accounting and reporting. Scope 1 includes 
direct emissions from within the organisational boundary, 
scope 2 represents indirect emissions due to electricity 
consumption, and scope 3 includes all other indirect 
emissions occurring as a consequence of the organisation’s 
activities. Within the boundary of the surgical suite, 
greenhouse gas emissions are reported as follows: scope 1, 
anaesthetic gases; scope 2, electricity use, energy for space 
heating; and scope 3, surgical supply chain, waste disposal.
The Greenhouse Gas Protocol states that non-Kyoto 
greenhouse gases should be reported separately, but as 
these represent the only direct emissions from the 
surgical suite, they have been included in scope 1. 
Thermal energy for space heating could be reported as 
scope 1, but has been included here in scope 2 as this 
combustion occurs outside of the surgical suite and is 
conceptually best considered with other energy-related 
emissions. Staff travel was excluded as it was considered 
outside of the study boundary.
Activity data were collected for each source of operating 
theatre emissions and multiplied by a relevant emissions 
factor to determine the carbon footprint. Site greenhouse 
gas evaluations were done between Jan 1 and Dec 31, 2011.
Scope 1
Annual volumes of volatile anaesthetic agents (desflurane, 
isoflurane, and sevoflurane) used at participating 
hospitals were determined from pharmacy purchasing 
records. As volatile anaesthetics undergo minimal in-vivo 
metabolism, the administered volume approximates the 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
The PubMed database was searched for articles published from 
inception until May 13, 2017, addressing the environmental 
impacts of surgery using the search terms “carbon footprint”, 
“greenhouse gas emissions”, “climate change”, “global 
warming”, and “life cycle assessment” in combination with 
“surgery”, “anaesthesia”, “operating theatre”, “operating room”, 
“hospital”, and “healthcare”. All article types and languages 
were included. We found six studies investigating the 
environmental impacts of individual surgical procedures or 
approaches (eg, laparoscopy, robot), as well as specialty-specific 
data in nephrology, ophthalmology, psychiatry, critical care, 
and primary care. The global warming potential of volatile 
anaesthetics is recognised, and attempts have been made to 
estimate their overall contribution to greenhouse gas 
emissions. Small surgical waste audits have reported the 
success of recycling programmes in diverting waste from 
landfill or avoiding incineration, and a single published report 
documents the activities of an operating theatre green 
committee at a US hospital. Life-cycle assessments of various 
medical devices and processes have been done. National-level 
health-care carbon footprint estimates are published for 
the USA and the UK.
The existing evidence on the impact of surgical activities on the 
environment encompasses individual products and procedures 
or comparisons of alternative surgical approaches. Although 
three studies apply aspects of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol 
methodology, none has undertaken a full carbon accounting 
study and all rely to varying degrees on low-quality activity data.
Added value of this study
This study is the first to investigate the carbon footprint of the 
entire surgical suite, estimating the carbon burden of the 
provision of surgical services as a multidisciplinary clinical 
specialty. The scope of this study far exceeds previous work and 
is designed to provide data at a level that would allow 
identification and implementation of emissions reduction 
strategies. The greenhouse gas inventory undertaken is the 
first comprehensive accounting of emissions in any medical 
specialty and is derived from granular primary activity data 
rather than approximations. This study is also the first to 
compare environmental performance in hospitals from three 
different countries.
Implications of all the available evidence
Surgical activities generate a substantial carbon footprint. 
Widespread implementation of the emissions reduction 
strategies identified here has the potential to dramatically 
reduce the carbon burden associated with the provision of 
surgical services. Climate change is one of the greatest public 
health threats today. Mitigating the climate impacts of 
health-care activities is a vital component of health sector 
leadership in responding to global climate change.

waste anaesthetic gas volume with the exception of 
sevoflurane for which a 5% correction was applied.7 
Emissions in CO2 equivalents (kg CO2e) were calculated 
using Global Warming Potential (GWP100) values from the 
work of Sulbaek Andersen and colleagues,8 which are a 
measure of the contribution of a greenhouse gas to 
climate change over a 100-year time horizon.
Scope 2
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system 
thermal energy requirements were calculated according to 
the specific system employed at each site (single duct 
reheat system at UMMC and JRH, dual duct system at 
VGH). System set-points and operating parameters were 
obtained from building automation systems and air flow 
rates used to determine total volume of air circulated and 
conditioned within a 24-h period. Using degree days from 
meteorological databases, the enthalpy required to 
condition air to stipulated set-points was calculated over a 
1-year period. Greenhouse gas emissions due to heating 
were calculated by multiplying the required energy by the 
UK Department of Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs 
(DEFRA) emissions factors for coal or natural gas, in 
keeping with the source of steam at each site. At VGH this 
is from an on-site natural gas boiler, at UMMC it is from a 
half-coal, half-natural gas-fired power plant on the 
University of Minnesota campus, and at JRH heating is 
via a combination of natural gas and electricity. Cooling 
was accomplished via centrifugal chillers, with coefficients 
of performance (COP) used to calculate required energy 
input. Electrical energy requirements of air handling units 
were measured directly via building automation systems.
The separation of operating theatres at JRH between 
different hospital wings resulted in variations in HVAC 
systems between theatres. For the purposes of this study, 
HVAC parameters from one wing were applied to 
calculate energy demands at both.
Lighting audits were done by compiling inventories of 
total lighting loads and power ratings and applying 
appropriate occupancy and usage patterns. Additional 
electricity consumption was determined by theatre 
submetering.
Greenhouse gas emissions due to electricity use were 
calculated using grid intensities (emissions produced per 
kWh of electricity generated) provided by local electrical 
utilities: 0·023 kg CO2/kWh at VGH, 0·548 kg CO2/kWh 
at UMMC, and 0·540 kg CO2/kWh at JRH. The 
considerable variability in carbon intensity of electricity 
supply reflects the preponderance of hydroelectricity in 
British Columbia as opposed to coal-dominated electrical 
grids in Minneapolis and Oxford.
Scope 3
Waste audits were done in which all waste generated 
within the study boundary was weighed and catalogued 
according to waste segregation practices at each 
institution during a representative sample of three week-
days and one weekend at each site. Measured waste 
volumes were extrapolated to annual values based on 
surgical case volumes during the audits relative to the 
rest of the year. Processing or disposal of each type of 
waste was investigated via personal visits to waste 
management facilities where energy and material inputs 
and outputs as well as transport distances were recorded.
Surgical waste was segregated into the following 
streams: municipal solid waste, domestic waste, 
hazardous waste, fluid waste, sharps, cytotoxic waste, 
black box waste (material that is both acutely toxic and 
infectious), recycling, and reusable textiles.
Municipal solid waste from all sites is incinerated at 
waste-to-energy facilities, and hazardous waste is 
autoclaved before landfill. At JRH a separate stream of 
municipal solid waste from corridors outside theatres is 
termed domestic waste and is landfilled without 
pretreatment. Sharps are autoclaved and landfilled at 
VGH and UMMC, and incinerated at JRH. Cytotoxic and 
black box waste are incinerated at specialised facilities for 
disposal of hazardous waste. Recycling is collected by 
local vendors and sold to a variety of users. Laundry at all 
three sites is processed by third parties. Third party 
single-use device reprocessing and on-site reprocessing 
of surgical instruments were excluded.
Carbon footprints were calculated by applying DEFRA 
greenhouse gas life-cycle conversion factors for waste 
disposal, which take into account greenhouse gas 
emissions generated upstream in the supply chain as well 
as in the downstream disposal.9 Production emissions 
factors were used to account for emissions involved in the 
manufacture of surgical consumables, based on the 
material composition of the waste stream. As the majority 
of theatre waste is composed of high-density and low-
density polyethylene (plastic tubing, basins, jugs), 
polypropylene and PET (disposable textiles, blue wrap), 
and latex, the production emissions factors for average 
plastics were applied (3179 kg CO2e/tonne), with a 
10% modifier to reflect the small non-plastic portion. 
Production emissions factors for plastic (3254 kg CO2e/
tonne), steel (2708 kg CO2e/tonne), and glass (895 kg 
CO2e/tonne) were used for sharps, cytotoxic, and black box 
waste, as these contain predominantly syringes, needles, 
and glass vials. Production emissions were omitted for 
reusable textiles as these were laundered and reused.
Combustion emissions factors for incineration with 
energy recovery were applied to the disposal of municipal 
solid waste from all three sites, again using the emissions 
factor for average plastics to reflect the composition of the 
surgical waste stream (1179 kg CO2e/tonne). The highest 
emissions factor for incineration was used for incineration 
of hazardous wastes (1833 kg CO2e/tonne). For steam 
disinfection of hazardous waste, process data from 
the Stericycle facility in Minneapolis (Stericycle Inc, 
Lake Forrest, IL, USA) were used to calculate emissions 
from autoclaving, and were extrapolated to the analogous 
facilities at the other two sites. Emissions due to laundering

of textiles were calculated from the K-Bro Linen facility in 
Burnaby (K-Bro Linen Inc, Edmonton, AB, Canada), and 
applied to UMMC and JRH with incorporation of local 
electrical grid intensities, as primary data from laundering 
facilities at these two sites were unavailable. Emissions 
factors for open-loop recycling (the process of recycling 
materials into other products) were used.

Results
Volatile anaesthetic agents resulted in similar emissions 
profiles at the two North American hospitals (2 034 277 kg 
CO2e/year at VGH and 2 129 841 kg CO2e/year at 
UMMC), whereas the carbon footprint of anaesthetic 
gases at the UK site was only 211 212 kg CO2e/year 
(table 1) despite a considerably higher case volume at the 
latter (30 000 cases per year vs 18 000–22 000 cases 
per year). This disparity in carbon intensity (7·0 kg CO2e 
per case at JRH vs 92·5 kg CO2e per case at VGH and 
118·3 kg CO2e per case at UMMC) can be accounted for 
by differential use of desflurane. Nitrous oxide use at all 
sites was found to be negligible.
Total annual energy consumption was 3382 MWh at 
VGH, 3856 MWh at UMMC, and 10 641 MWh at JRH 
(table 2). HVAC demands comprised 90–99% of 
operating theatre energy consumption at all sites. 
Corresponding carbon footprints were 534 194 kg CO2e 
for VGH, 1 515 763 kg CO2e for UMMC, and 4 344 150 kg 
CO2e for JRH per year. VGH had the best energy 
performance (2·0 MWh/m²), probably due to HVAC 
system set-backs for energy conservation after-hours. 
UMMC, despite being of similar building stock to VGH, 
had no titration of ventilation based on occupancy, and a 
higher energy intensity (2·7 MWh/m²). JRH consumed 
disproportionately 
more 
energy 
per 
unit 
area 
(3·5 kWh/m²), probably because of the older building 
and infrastructure at this site. The low carbon-intensity 
of British Columbia’s electricity supply is apparent in the 
considerably lower emissions at VGH compared with the 
other sites in all energy categories apart from heating, 
which is provided by natural gas.
Hospital-level energy performance data were available 
for two sites. Energy consumption at VGH averaged 
2·38 GJ/m² whereas the operating theatres consumed 
7·15 GJ/m². The building energy performance of JRH 
was 2·14 GJ/m² but that of the surgical suite was 
12·61 GJ/m². The energy intensity of operating theatres 
in this study is thus shown to be three to six times that of 
the hospital building average.
A representative waste management map (figure 1) 
shows the trajectory of the surgical waste streams from 
VGH. Mean daily waste was 1165 kg for VGH, 681 kg for 
UMMC, and 792 kg for JRH. On a per case basis, JRH 
generated the least amount of waste at 7·62 kg per case, 
as compared with 11·92 kg per case at UMMC and 
16·39 kg per case at VGH.
At VGH and UMMC, the predominant waste fractions 
were municipal solid waste and reusable textiles, 
whereas JRH generated mainly municipal solid waste 
and hazardous waste. Differences in the relative 
proportions of municipal solid waste and hazardous 
waste largely reflect waste segregation practices at each 
institution. At JRH all surgical gowns and drapes are

considered hazardous waste, even if not heavily soiled 
with bodily fluids. By contrast, VGH has more stringent 
definitions of hazardous waste such that a much smaller 
proportion of theatre waste is disposed of in this stream. 
At VGH reusable surgical gowns are used which, in 
combination with liberal use of flannel blankets for 
patient comfort, resulted in a much larger fraction of 
reusable textiles compared with the other two sites. 
UMMC employs the Stryker Neptune fluid management 
system, which discharges fluid waste directly to the 
hospital sanitation system, thereby eliminating fluid 
waste from scope 3.
Using DEFRA life-cycle emissions factors to take into 
account emissions embedded in the production of surgical 
consumables as well as in their disposal, VGH was found 
to produce 650 436 kg CO2e/year, compared with 
536 260 kg CO2e/year at UMMC and 632 574 kg CO2e/year 
at JRH (table 3).
Cumulative carbon footprints are shown in table 4 with 
the relative contribution of each scope shown in figure 2. 
Overall, JRH had the largest carbon footprint at 
5 187 936 kg CO2e/year, followed by UMMC at 4 181 864 kg 
CO2e/year and VGH at 3 218 907 kg CO2e/year. On a per 
unit area basis, JRH had the lowest carbon intensity at 
1702 kg CO2e/m2, compared with 1951 kg CO2e/m2 at 
VGH and 2284 kg CO2e/m2 at UMMC. Taking into 
account the case volumes at all three sites, VGH had the 
lowest carbon intensity per operation at 146 kg CO2e per 
case compared with 173 kg CO2e per case at JRH and 
232 kg CO2e per case at UMMC. At both North American 
sites, anaesthetic gases were the primary source of 
operating theatre emissions, whereas most of the carbon 
footprint at JRH was attributable to energy consumption.
Discussion
The estimation of carbon footprints in health care is still 
in its infancy. Three studies have approximated emissions 
from national health-care systems using economic 
data,3–5 
thereby 
providing 
important 
contextual 
information to compare the health sector with other 
global industries and to situate it within a national carbon 
emissions profile. Whereas national level estimates are 
valuable, emissions reduction strategies must be 
developed and implemented at a more grassroots level 
where their individual components can be identified and 
managed. Connor and colleagues were the first to 
examine specialty-level emissions, quantifying the 
carbon footprint of a renal unit in the UK as well as 
haemodialysis processes,10,11 and recently expanded into 
the surgical realm with the carbon footprint of a cataract 
procedure.12 This study is the first to examine the carbon 
burden 
associated 
with 
the 
surgical 
suite, 
a 
multidisciplinary space that we propose is an ideal 
functional unit for effecting change. Operating theatres 
represent a defined physical area under the control of 
facilities managers, as well as an economically discreet 
subsector of the hospital responsible for its own supply 
chain. The multiple professional groups that populate 
the space each have the ability to affect the overall carbon 
footprint by critically examining practice patterns and 
instituting specialty-wide behaviour change. As one of 
the most resource-intensive areas of the hospital, it is 
anticipated that emissions reduction strategies targeting 
the operating theatre will be among the highest-yield 
within the health-care industry.
Inclusion of three sites from different geographical 
regions and health-care systems allows a comparison of 
emissions profiles to formulate recommendations for 
improved environmental performance. Emissions due to 
anaesthetic gases comprise most of the overall carbon 
footprint at both North American hospitals accounting for 
2000 tonnes CO2e at each site, which is ten-fold higher 
than the anaesthetic gas emissions from the UK site. This 
finding is attributable to differential use of desflurane, 
which is the preferred volatile agent at VGH and UMMC 
but is not used at JRH due to its high cost. Desflurane has 
the advantage of faster induction and emergence than 
other volatile agents, but it has a GWP100 of 2540, which is 
five to 18 times more than isoflurane and sevoflurane. It 
has been previously shown to be the primary contributor

to global anaesthetic gas emissions.13 Preferential use of 
alternative anaesthetic agents or strategies (eg, regional 
techniques, total intravenous anaesthesia) has the potential 
to dramatically reduce theatre greenhouse gas emissions.7 
A lack of awareness regarding the environmental impacts 
of anaesthetic choices is believed to be the greatest barrier 
to widespread implementation of low-carbon practices.14
While HVAC systems have been shown to be responsible 
for 52% of the energy needs of inpatient health-care 
facilities,15 we found that HVAC energy demands 
comprised 90–99% of overall theatre energy use, reflecting 
the more aggressive space conditioning requirements for 
theatres relative to other inpatient areas. This finding 
partially explains the relatively higher energy consumption 
of JRH, as theatre energy use is directly correlated to the 
size of the surgical suite. Energy conservation efforts 
should therefore focus on HVAC system management. 
Occupancy-based ventilation strategies reduce unnecessary 
air flow to unused space and have the potential for 
considerable energy savings. These measures were already 
in place to a limited extent at VGH, reflected in its 
improved energy performance compared with the other 
two sites. By extending the HVAC set-backs at VGH to the 
maximum number of theatres, reducing air flow rates to 
19 of 22 theatres overnight and on weekends, leaving 
three theatres online for emergencies, we demonstrated a 
50% reduction in HVAC energy consumption compared 
with baseline.
The substantial variability in greenhouse gas emissions 
due to energy use between sites demonstrates the 
importance of the carbon intensity of local electricity 
supply. There was a 24-fold difference in grid intensity 
between British Columbia, which is supplied by 
hydroelectricity, and Oxford and Minnesota which have 
coal-dominated electrical grids. For deregulated energy 
markets with multiple possible suppliers, the selection of 
a low-carbon electricity source has the potential to 
substantially impact emissions.
Emissions resulting from the manufacture of surgical 
consumables are invariably underestimated in this study 
as they are approximated using production emissions 
factors which reflect only those emissions embedded in 
the raw materials (eg, polypropylene) and fail to capture 
emissions involved in the manufacture, sterilisation, and 
transport of end products. A more accurate accounting of 
surgical supply chain emissions via economic analyses 
or individual product footprinting would be expected to 
reveal a substantially larger scope 3 footprint. To 
determine the relative environmental impact of one 
product over another, full life-cycle assessment is 
required, such as that done by Eckelman and colleagues16 
demonstrating that the carbon footprint of a single-use 
laryngeal mask airway is 11·3 kg CO2e versus 7·4 kg CO2e 
for the reusable alternative. Given the increasing 
availability of single-use surgical consumables, such 
robust investigations are invaluable in informing 
purchasing decisions. In its original carbon footprinting 
exercise in 2009, NHS England found that scope 3 
accounted for 65% of total greenhouse gas emissions, 
and that pharmaceuticals and medical devices were 
responsible for nearly half of these. The exclusion of 
pharmaceuticals from the current study thus represents 
a considerable limitation and further underscores the 
conservative nature of the scope 3 results. Additionally, 
steam sterilisation of reusable surgical instruments 
would need to be included in a comprehensive scope 3 
inventory. McGain and colleagues17 found that this 
required 1·9 kWh/kg of mass sterilised, and that 
inefficiencies in the process were common.
The Lancet Commission on Climate and Health2 has 
called for the health-care community to take a leadership 
role in advocating for emissions reductions, and to

critically examine its own activities with respect to their 
effects on human and environmental health. This study 
is the first to estimate the considerable climate impacts 
of surgical services. Averaging the greenhouse gas 
emissions measured here on a per theatre basis gives a 
carbon intensity of 188 tonnes CO2e per theatre per year. 
If the hospitals studied were representative of their 
respective regions, extrapolation of these results to the 
number of operating theatres within these three 
countries would yield a total carbon footprint of 
9·7 million tonnes CO2e/year, or the equivalent of 
2 million passenger vehicles.
Addressing the environmental impacts of the operating 
theatre will require coordinated multidisciplinary action 
from the diverse members of the surgical team. Similar 
to the process by which enhanced recovery after surgery 
(ERAS) protocols have expedited and improved recovery 
after 
many 
operations18–21 by 
assimilating 
and 
standardising best practices from anaesthesia, surgery, 
nursing, and other health professionals involved in 
perioperative care, so too optimisation of operating 
theatre 
environmental 
performance 
relies 
upon 
engagement and innovation from the many players who 
converge to deliver surgical services. Anaesthetists are 
positioned to take ownership of a large proportion of the 
theatre footprint by reducing emissions from volatile 
agents, whereas HVAC system optimisation falls within 
the purview of facilities managers and engineers. 
Surgeons, nurses, perfusionists, and others can influence 
environmentally preferable purchasing and minimise 
waste. Much like adoption of ERAS pathways, reducing 
the environmental impact of surgical services requires a 
collective drive for cultural change, this time toward a 
culture of sustainability and social responsibility.
Best practices in operating theatre environmental 
performance remain to be determined, but measuring 
and reporting emissions and comparing profiles as we 
have done here is a necessary prerequisite. The power of 
data to drive quality improvement has been demonstrated 
by the American College of Surgeons National Surgical 
Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP), which 
allows hospitals to see how they are performing relative to 
comparable institutions with respect to a multitude of 
metrics related to quality of surgical care.22,23 ACS-NSQIP 
provides a platform for collaboration and sharing of best 
practices while leaving responsibility for action with the 
participating institutions. In the experience of this study, 
the observed variability in environmental performance 
led to a cross-pollination of advantageous ideas between 
sites. Similar to the cost savings demonstrated with 
avoidance of surgical complications by ACS-NSQIP, the 
emissions reduction strategies described here entail 
convenient economic co-benefits that only strengthen the 
case for attention to environmental performance. While a 
cost-effectiveness analysis is beyond the scope of this 
study, desflurane is the most expensive volatile 
anaesthetic, accounting for 83–86% of the cost of volatile 
agents at VGH and UMMC, with JRH demonstrating 
that higher surgical case volumes can be done at a fraction 
of the cost of volatile anaesthetics. Energy conservation 
and waste reduction have similar financial incentives.
This study is the most comprehensive greenhouse gas 
inventory of operating theatres to date. However, it has a 
number of considerable limitations, including reliance 
on production emissions factors to approximate upstream 
emissions in the surgical supply chain and omission of 
pharmaceuticals and steam sterilisation data. Waste 
volumes were gleaned from a representative sample 
using waste audits rather than having access to actual 
annual waste data for each stream. Estimation of national 
level emissions from operating theatres on the basis of a 
very limited sample entails a high degree of uncertainty, 
but in spite of this we feel that even a crude estimate is 
beneficial to help situate surgical services within the 
broader context of health-care carbon footprints.
We have estimated the carbon footprint of surgical suites 
and identified initial strategies for improved environmental 
performance. Although further work is needed to refine 
the benefits that might be realised, it is clear that both 
carbon and cost savings are possible and that 
multidisciplinary action should be undertaken to minimise 
the adverse effects of surgery on the environment.
