Malnutrition

Malnutrition, which encompasses under- and overnutrition, is responsible for an
enormous morbidity and mortality burden globally. Malnutrition results from
disordered nutrient assimilation but is also characterized by recurrent infections
and chronic inflammation, implying an underlying immune defect. Defects
emerge before birth via modifications in the immunoepigenome of malnourished
parents, and these may contribute to intergenerational cycles of malnutrition.
This review summarizes key recent studies from experimental animals, in vitro
models, and human cohorts, and proposes that immune dysfunction is both a
cause and a consequence of malnutrition. Focusing on childhood undernutri-
tion, we highlight gaps in current understanding of immune dysfunction in
malnutrition, with a view to therapeutically targeting immune pathways as a
novel means to reduce morbidity and mortality.
Malnutrition as an Immunodeficiency Syndrome
Malnutrition, which encompasses both under- and overnutrition, is responsible for an enormous
health burden globally [1,2] (Box 1). Although broadly defined as impaired nutrient assimilation,
malnutrition does not simply arise from inadequate food intake. Obesity can develop indepen-
dently of poor diet and persist despite switching to a healthy diet [3–7], and stunting prevalence
is only modestly reduced by intensive feeding interventions [8]. Despite manifesting as distinct
physical defects, several observations implicate shared etiological pathways in under- and
overnutrition: early-life undernutrition increases the risk of obesity in later life [4,9]; altered
metabolism [10–13], chronic inflammation [11,14,15], and gut dysfunction (enteropathy)
[11,12,16] are features of both conditions; and excess energy and macronutrient intake is
often coincident with micronutrient deficiencies in overweight individuals [17,18]. There is a
growing appreciation that malnutrition is complex, reflecting a suite of overlapping comorbidities
that are poorly understood [19–21]. Characterizing pathogenesis across the spectrum of
malnutrition is essential to underpin novel therapeutic approaches to support international goals
to improve nutrition, health, and well-being (https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org).
Undernourished children principally die of common infections [22,23], implying that mortality is
related to underlying immunodeficiency, even in mild forms of undernutrition [24]. Infections are
more common and more severe in people with obesity [25]. Defects in both the innate and
adaptive arms of the immune system have been consistently demonstrated in undernourished
children (Box 2) [23]. In this review we explore the hypothesis that immune dysfunction is both a
cause and consequence of malnutrition, and summarize key recent evidence from experimental

animal models, human cohorts, and in vitro studies. We regard malnutrition as a syndrome in
which multiple underlying processes are the cause of elevated mortality and morbidity [20]
(Box 1); immune dysfunction is involved in many of these pathways and is therefore a key driver
of the vicious cycle that leads to clinical malnutrition (Figure 1). Our focus is childhood
Box 1. Epidemiology and Clinical Features of Malnutrition
Malnutrition is a clinical syndrome that encompasses a spectrum of anthropometric defects from wasting (low weight-for-
height) and stunting (low height-for-age) in undernutrition to overweight (body mass index, BMI, of 25–30) and obesity
(BMI >30) in overnutrition. An estimated 3.1 million children under 5 years die annually as a result of undernutrition,
accounting for 45% of all child mortality [2]. The global prevalence of overweight in the under 5 year age group increased
by 54% between 1990 and 2011 [2].
Growth faltering in developing countries is often evident at birth. Weight-for-age and length-for-age Z scores continue to
decline over the first 2 years of life, with little recovery thereafter [70]. Maternal height and infant birthweight are consistent
predictors of infant growth (short mothers bear small babies who become stunted adults themselves) [20]. Stunting
affects around 165 million children worldwide (www.who.int/nutgrowthdb/estimates/en) and is associated with short-
term increases in infectious mortality and long-term neurodevelopmental defects [20,65,87]. Stunted children are shorter
than healthy reference populations (height-for-age Z score �2) and may exhibit reduced exploratory behavior and
physiological arousal [87], but are otherwise clinically well.
Wasting affects approximately 52 million children (www.who.int/nutgrowthdb/estimates/en) and has a stronger associa-
tion with case mortality than stunting. Wasting is characterized by loss of fat and muscle in the thighs, buttocks, upper
arms, and ribs; severe acute malnutrition (SAM) is characterized by severe wasting (mid-upper arm circumference
(MUAC) <115 mm for children aged 6–59 months and/or weight-for-height Z score �3; www.who.int/childgrowth/
standards). Kwashiorkor is a distinct SAM phenotype typified by skin and hair changes, irritability, symmetrical edema,
and fatty liver infiltration. Children with uncomplicated SAM (no apparent infections and good appetite) can be managed
in the community with energy-dense micronutrient-supplemented foods [84]. Children with complicated SAM (clinically
unwell and/or refusing feeds) are often physiologically unstable, with impaired organ function, coinfections, micronutrient
deficiencies, and a high risk of dying, which requires immediate hospitalization, supervised feeding and rehydration, and
broad-spectrum antibiotics even if symptoms of infection are absent [84].
Early-life undernutrition confers an increased risk of obesity in adulthood [4,9]. This ‘double burden’ of malnutrition
disproportionately affects low- and middle-income countries undergoing rapid socioeconomic changes [4]. Clinical
symptoms of obesity include high percentage adipose tissue, high circulating levels of triglycerides, high blood pressure
which can lead to cardiovascular disease, and high blood glucose levels reflecting insulin resistance which can lead to
type-2 diabetes [4,6,9,25]. Similarly to undernutrition, overweight is associated with an increased risk of all-cause [1] and
infectious mortality [25].
Box 2. Immune Defects in Undernourished Children
A recent systematic literature review [23] identified 245 studies published between 1957 and 2014 describing immune
parameters in undernourished children (age 0–5 years). However, the review highlights that the majority of studies were
conducted several decades ago using out-dated immunology techniques and focused on hospitalized children with
severe forms of malnutrition and multiple coinfections. Characterization of immunodeficiency was limited by a lack of
longitudinal studies, particularly for mild and moderate malnutrition. The precise nature of immunodeficiency in under-
nutrition therefore remains uncertain; however, the consensus from the available evidence is that both innate and
adaptive immunity are impaired by malnutrition. Defects in innate immune function include impaired epithelial barrier
function of the skin and gut, reduced granulocyte microbicidal activity, fewer circulating dendritic cells, and reduced
complement proteins, but preserved leukocyte numbers and acute phase response. Defects in adaptive immune
function include reduced levels of soluble IgA in saliva and tears, lymphoid organ atrophy, reduced delayed-type
hypersensitivity responses, fewer circulating B cells, a shift from Th1-associated to Th2-associated cytokines, and
lymphocyte hyporesponsiveness to phytohemagglutinin, but preserved lymphocyte and immunoglobulin levels in
peripheral blood. Despite this, most malnourished children seem to respond adequately to vaccination, although the
timing, quality, and longevity of vaccine-specific responses may be impaired [71,72].
There is an evident need for contemporary studies of childhood undernutrition incorporating up-to-date functional
immunological methods in well-characterized longitudinal cohorts of children. Studies need to define malnutrition using
current metrics of stunting, wasting, or both together, with appropriate well-nourished comparison groups, and evaluate
associations between immune parameters and clinical outcomes. Development of novel experimental approaches to
explore immune ontogeny [88,89], epigenetics [5,32–34], immunometabolomics [61], the gut microbiome [49] and
virome [90], enteropathy [59], and nutrient-sensing [38,39] also provide unprecedented opportunities for translation into
immunological studies of childhood undernutrition. Because immunodeficiency is also a feature of overnutrition (reviewed
recently [6,25]), immunological studies in overweight and obese children may also be pertinent to understanding
immunopathogenesis in undernutrition.

 undernutrition in developing countries, where the greatest burden of mortality is concentrated
[2], but we also identify relevant studies of overnutrition. Throughout the review we highlight
research gaps that need to be addressed in future studies and speculate on the potential for
immune-targeted therapies to reduce morbidity and mortality in undernourished children.
Immune Development in Malnutrition
The trajectory of infant immune development during the first 1000 days of life (Box 3) is sensitive
to nutritional status, such that impaired immune organ growth [26–28] and thymic atrophy
[23,29] can be evident at birth in undernourished infants. In a rural Bangladeshi cohort, thymic
index (TI) at birth was positively associated with birthweight [27] and all-cause mortality at 8
weeks [26]. Compared to adequately nourished rat pups, pups of dams exposed to protein
energy malnutrition (PEM) during lactation have smaller thymuses [30,31], increased thymocyte
apoptosis [31], and a greater proinflammatory thymocyte response to leptin as a result of higher
leptin receptor expression [30]. These observations suggest an interacting relationship between
nutrition, growth, and immune development, of which thymic size is one indicator. Infant
infections, microbial colonization of the gut, T cell activation, and TI have also been linked to

Immune dysfunction can arise before birth via developmental pathways (purple), compounded by environmental and
behavioral factors (yellow), particularly those experienced during early life. Immune dysfunction (blue; as defined in a recent
systematic review [23] and summarized in Box 2) can contribute both directly and indirectly to a range of causal pathways
(green) that lead to clinical malnutrition (red; refer to Box 1 for the clinical features of under- and overnutrition in humans).

 breast-feeding practices (Box 3), but the specific breast milk components responsible have not
been identified.
It is increasingly apparent that malnutrition can influence immune development before conception
because maternal malnutrition confers epigenetic modifications in her offspring [32–34]. Gambian
women who conceived during periods of low food availability had lower plasma concentrations of
methyl-donor pathway substrates relative to women who conceived during periods of higher food
availability, and their infants had distinct percentages of methylation of known metastable epialleles
at 2–8 months of age [34]. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of pre- and
periconception multiple micronutrient supplementation also found differences in infant DNA
methylation between the supplemented and unsupplemented groups [32,33]. Methylation differ-
ences in immune (SIGLEC5, CD4, and KLRC2) and innate defense (BPIL1, CHIT1, and DEFB123)
genes were evident at birth, and some were still detectable 9 months later [33], suggesting that
maternal micronutrient supplementation had a lasting impact on the infant immune epigenome.
Distinct methylation of the IL10 locus has also been identified in Dutch adults exposed to famine in
utero relative to their unexposed sex-matched siblings over 50 years later [35]. How the perinatal
immune epigenome affects long-term immune function has not been assessed; however, the
heritable impact of malnutrition suggests that the optimal timing for therapeutic interventions to
rescue infant growth and development may need to be re-evaluated [20,29].
The intimate association between the nutritional status of infants and their mothers means that
the relative impacts of immune dysfunction and maternal diet on infant malnutrition are difficult to
extricate. However, paternal malnutrition has recently been shown to impart heritable changes
on infant metabolism and immune function without in utero exposure to a marginal diet [36,37].
Male mice exposed to in utero PEM had distinct epigenetic marks at the Lxra locus that were
inherited by their adequately nourished offspring [37]. Lxra encodes a nuclear receptor involved
in inflammation and lipid metabolism, and Lxra-dependent changes in liver lipid-synthesis genes
Box 3. Immune Development During the First 1000 Days of Life
The first 1000 days of life (from conception to 2 years) is identified as a developmental window of opportunity for
therapeutic interventions for undernutrition (www.thousanddays.org/) and is also a critical period in immune development
[91]. Evidence that early-life malnutrition confers life-long immunodeficiency [4,20,24] is consistent with a ‘layered’ model
of immune ontogeny in which adult immune function relies on developmental steps at earlier ages (e.g., fetal and adult
CD4+ T cells derive from phenotypically-distinct hematopoietic stem cells [89]). Immune responses are more tolerogenic
in infancy than adulthood, fetal naïve T cells differentiate into Tregs more readily [89], Tregs comprise higher proportions
of CD4+ T cells in pediatric (30–40%) versus adult tissues (1–10%) [88], and maternal alloantigen-specific T cell expansion
is suppressed by high Treg frequencies in infant lymphoid organs [92].
GALT population by lymphocytes begins in utero, but postnatal cues from environmental (dietary and microbial) antigens
instigate optimal positioning and accumulation of peripherally matured cells [38,88]. Analysis of infant organ donor tissues
showed that activated T cell populations initially expand at mucosal sites, likely due to ingested or inhaled antigen
exposure [88]. Naïve (CD45RA+CCR7+) T cells predominate in most infant tissues (70–90%) relative to adults (<50%);
however, the gut and lungs had the highest TEM (CD45RA � CCR7 � ) proportions in the infant tissues analyzed [88]. A
role for immune receptor interactions with environmental antigens in murine gut development has been conclusively
demonstrated [48,93]. Vascularization of the ileum, epithelial cell proliferation, and colonic mast cells are perturbed in
neonatal mice lacking the TLR and IL-1 receptor-associated signaling molecules MyD88 and TRIF [48]. Mice weaned
onto macromolecule-depleted chow devoid of dietary antigens lack peripherally generated Treg (pTreg) cells required for
oral tolerance [93]. These effects were distinguishable from those of the microbiota because MyD88- and TRIF-deficient
animals had similar fecal microbiota compositions to co-housed littermates [48]. Comparison of intestinal tissue from
macromolecule-deficient mice, germ-free mice and mice exposed to a normal diet and microbial colonization showed
that diet-induced and microbiota-induced pTreg populate distinct locations [93].
Infant diet shapes environmental antigen exposure, and weaning alters mucosal development [48]. Exclusive breastfeeding
is recommended for the first 6 months of life in developing countries, thereby providing essential nutrients and maternal
immune factors [91]. Early introduction of non-breast milk foods increases risk of diarrhea [94], which coincides with growth
faltering [20,55]. Breast milk also contains microbes [95] which engage immune receptors and seed the gastrointestinal tract
[96]. Birth mode (vaginal or caesarean) [96] and breastfeeding duration [95] shape the infant microbiota.

 were evident in second-generation offspring [37]. The sperm epigenome of obese men has also
been shown to respond to weight loss after bariatric surgery [36].
Gut Immune Responses in Malnutrition
The gut is the primary interface between diet and the immune system, and a range of postnatal
cues from the microbiota, pathogens, and dietary components are required for healthy devel-
opment of gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT; Box 3).
Direct Nutrient Sensing
A range of micronutrients and nutrient metabolites act as direct immune stimuli [38], but isolating
their independent effects has been largely restricted to murine models in which diet can
be carefully controlled. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which binds to metabolites of
cruciferous vegetables, is abundantly expressed on murine intraepithelial lymphocytes
(IEL; TCRgd+CD44intCD25�CD69+CCR6�) and intrinsic AhR signaling is essential for their
localization in the gut and skin [39]. Lymphoid tissue-inducer cells (a type of innate lymphoid
cell, ILC3, involved in lymphoid development) express AhR and retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-
related orphan receptor (ROR) gt, which interacts with the vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid,
demonstrating a mechanistic link between nutrient sensing and immune development [39–41].
Murine dendritic cell (DC) subsets vary in their relative expression of retinoid and rexinoid
receptor isoforms, leading to selective loss of splenic CD11b+CD8/�Esamhigh DC and the
associated gut-homing CD11b+CD103+ DC subset in vitamin A-deficient mice [40]. An analo-
gous population of CD103+ DC has been isolated from human mesenteric lymph nodes [42],
although their micronutrient receptor profiles and functions have not been investigated in
malnutrition. DCs can also synthesize retinoic acid, which influences subsequent T cell trafficking
(reviewed in [43]) and promotes T regulatory cell (Treg) induction in the lamina propria (reviewed
in [44]). Peyers patch follicular DCs, a specialized cell type promoting high-affinity antibody
responses, also express RARs and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in mice [45]. Both vitamin A and
MyD88 deficiencies result in reduced IgA production in murine Peyers patch germinal centers
and lower B cell chemoattractant CXCL13 and B cell activating factor expression [45], impli-
cating sensing of both micronutrients and bacteria in mucosal B cell function.
Importantly, nutrient-sensing pathways such as AhR and RAR signaling, directly influence clear-
ance of gastrointestinal infections in murine models [39,41]. Direct nutrient sensing may also enable
the gut immune system to adapt to adverse environmental conditions, including micronutrient
deficiencies. For example, mice subjected to vitamin A deficiency exhibit profound reductions in
ILC3 and antibacterial responses, with a compensatory expansion in IL-13-producing ILC2,
leading to increased anti-helminth responses [41]. Collectively these experiments refute the idea
that undernutrition leads to a generalized reduction in immune responsiveness, supporting instead
a model of phenotypic plasticity in mucosal immunity that responds to nutrient availability. These
murine models highlight mechanisms that may be pertinent to human malnutrition because vitamin
A deficiency is one of the most common micronutrient deficiencies globally. Meta-analysis of 43
clinical trials of oral vitamin A supplementation in infancy demonstrated a consistent reduction in
diarrheal incidence and mortality [46]; however, no trials assessed mucosal immune responses.
All-trans retinoic acid supplementation led to slight elevations in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and
vaccine peptide-specific IgA in the whole gut lavage fluid, but not the serum, of Zambian adults in a
small typhoid vaccination study [43,47], highlighting the benefit of investigating both peripheral and
mucosal immune responses in future studies.
Microbiota
In addition to nutrient sensing, microbiota sensing via pathogen-recognition receptors (PRR) is
also required for GALT development [48] (Box 3). The configuration of commensal micro-
organisms (microbiota) detectable in feces is altered in malnutrition (Box 4), and fecal transplants
390 
Trends in Immunology, June 2016, Vol. 37, No. 6
 from undernourished children recapitulate weight loss in gnotobiotic mice [13], suggesting that
the microbiota may contribute to malnutrition [49]. The immune system has been implicated in
this relationship by IgA profiling studies demonstrating that a portion of the fecal microbiota from
Malawian infants with SAM is directly bound by mucosal antibodies [50]. Importantly, the IgA-
targeted consortia transferred enteropathy to adult germ-free mice, but the bacterial species
less often targeted by IgA did not [50]. Pathological changes in the microbiota and nutrient
metabolite levels in overweight adults were associated with increased epithelial proliferation
rates, IEL numbers, and CD68+ macrophages in colonic biopsies [12]. Notably, the 16S
ribosomal RNA-detectable fecal community analyzed in these studies represents only a subset
of the microbial load present in the gut. Future studies incorporating less-accessible microbes
and immune cells from gut tissue will be necessary to delineate their relative roles in
undernutrition.
Infections, Enteropathy, and Inflammation
Healthy gut function requires a large surface area for nutrient absorption, made possible by the
complex villous architecture of the intestinal epithelium, and an intact intestinal barrier to prevent
pathogen translocation into extraintestinal tissues. Both are markedly impaired in malnourished
individuals [51–53], and there is an almost universal abnormality of gut structure and function
among individuals inhabiting impoverished conditions, termed environmental enteric dysfunction
(EED) [19,51,52]. Repeated exposure to enteric pathogens is hypothesized to be the predomi-
nant cause of EED in conditions of poor sanitation [20,51,52], but multiple causes of enteropathy
are likely in developing countries [51]. Microarray of fecal samples from Malawian children with
EED identified a range of mRNA transcripts for immune genes significantly correlated with
intestinal permeability (percentage lactulose recovery following a dual-sugar absorption test), an
indicator of EED severity [54]. These findings implicate immune pathways in gut dysfunction, and
future studies will be necessary to explore their relationship with malabsorption, particularly in
children with SAM who were excluded from microarray analysis [54].
Box 4. The Microbiota in Malnutrition
The microbiota plays a direct role in digestion by metabolizing nutrients that the human gut cannot [38,49]. Without
signals from microbial components, mucosal immune development and digestion are markedly impaired [48,93,97], and
reciprocal immune signals shape microbiota composition [97]. Unlike intestinal epithelial cells, which are segregated from
the gut lumen by a mucus layer and innate defense mechanisms, the microbiota is in intimate contact with ingested food
and environmental contaminants, and the emerging view is that the microbiota is a sensor of dietary change [11,38,49].
This hypothesis has been confirmed through systematic modifications of dietary protein, fat, polysaccharide, and simple
sugars in gnotobiotic mice populated with 10 defined human gut bacterial species, in which each nutrient governed
distinct microbial compositions, and protein changes accounted for the largest variations [98].
16S ribosomal RNA sequencing of bacteria in human fecal samples from developing countries has highlighted the
specific contribution of the microbiota to undernutrition in children [13,16,50,90], and complementary murine models can
be generated via fecal transplantation from children with SAM into gnotobiotic mice [13,16,90]. Cohorts of twins and
triplets discordant for malnutrition, and detailed longitudinal characterization of healthy microbial colonization in healthy
‘exemplar’ infants inhabiting similar environments, have allowed a range of common confounders in human malnutrition
studies to be controlled for, including age-dependent microbial plasticity; environmental factors such as diet, pathogen
exposure, and WASH; and host genetic variation.
Relative to age-matched adequately nourished children, children with SAM have defects in the diversity and composition of
commensal microbes [13,16,90], termed ‘microbiota immaturity’ [16]. Although therapeutic feeding interventions ameliorate
changes in the bacterial microbiota of children with SAM [16], the virome is unaffected [90], and the bacterial microbiome
returns to its pre-intervention composition after feeding interventions have ceased [13,16]. Healthy fecal metabolite profiles in
gnotobiotic mice transplanted with the microbiota from undernourished children were also restored when animals were fed
nutrient-rich chow, but regressed once mice returned to a nutrient-poor ‘Malawian’ diet, reflecting the direct impact of
microbial changes on digestion [13]. Microbiota composition and fecal and urinary metabolite profiles also shifted in rural-
dwelling South Africans fed a high-fat, low-fiber ‘Westernized’ diet [12]. These observations demonstrate that microbiota
composition and the quality of nutrient digestion are rapidly reconfigured by dietary interventions, but these changes are not
sustained, either owing to underlying defects in gut immune function, reintroduction of an inadequate diet, or continued
exposure to unfavorable environmental selection pressures (e.g., poor WASH).

 EED may affect the immune system through several mechanisms: (i) altered nutrient-sensing
pathways required for GALT development, (ii) mechanical gut tissue damage releasing host-
derived immune-activating damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and upregulating
epithelial repair [54], and (iii) loss of gut barrier function leading to systemic leakage of microbes
and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) from the gut lumen (a process termed
microbial translocation). Few studies have examined human gut biopsy samples, leaving these
overlapping mechanisms poorly distinguished. However, gut damage is evident early in life in
developing countries, and incremental acquisition of enteric infections [55], circulating PAMPs,
and systemic inflammation are linked to poor linear growth [14,15,56]. Proinflammatory medi-
ators may contribute to stunting by dysregulating growth hormone signaling, consistent with
murine models showing that genetic overexpression of IL-6 negatively regulates insulin-like
growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels [57]. Zimbabwean infants who became stunted by 18 months of
age had significantly higher plasma concentrations of proinflammatory markers (C-reactive
protein, CRP, and /1-acid glycoprotein, AGP) and lower plasma levels of IGF-1 than their
non-stunted counterparts [14]. IGF-1 levels negatively correlated with CRP, AGP, IL-6 and
soluble CD14 in this cohort [14], and with CRP, IFN-g, IL-1/, and MIP-1/ in a smaller cohort of
Kenyan infants with SAM, stunting, and chronic inflammation [56]. Plasma LPS levels were
negatively associated with linear growth in the latter study [56]. Dysregulation of growth factor
signaling is also evident in type 1 diabetic enteropathy where high circulating IGF-1 binding
protein levels impair the in vitro growth and differentiation of IGF-1 receptor+ colonic stem cells
[58]; thus chronic inflammation in undernutrition could plausibly exacerbate enteropathy through
simultaneous epithelial damage and dysregulation of IGF-1-dependent stem cell-mediated
mucosal repair.
A better understanding of immunopathogenesis in malnutrition has arisen from a murine model
of EED [59]. C57BL/6 mice fed fat- and protein-reduced diets developed mild stunting and
wasting and, consistent with observations in human EED [15,51,52], poor growth was accom-
panied by reduced gut integrity and an altered microbiota [59]. The EED gut had more duodenal
gd IELs, higher jejunal proinflammatory cytokine responses to oral doses of bacteria, and higher
jejunal and cecal Salmonella typhimurium loads post-challenge than adequately nourished
animals [59]. Collectively, this model demonstrates that infection-driven dysregulation of muco-
sal immune function can cause EED, systemic inflammation, and growth failure. Alternative
murine models provide proof-of-concept that chronic immune activation, as seen in EED, can
drive wasting and infection susceptibility independently of dietary deficiency. Transgenic mice
constitutively expressing the activation-induced costimulatory ligand CD70 exhibited progres-
sive CD27-dependent expansion of T effector memory cells (TEM) and reciprocal depletion of
naïve T cells in secondary lymphoid organs, resulting in weight loss and premature death from
opportunistic Pneumocystis carinii infection [60]. The CD70–CD27 pathway is postulated to be
overactive in human HIV [60] and may also compound infectious mortality in undernutrition.
Immunometabolic Signatures of Malnutrition
Immunometabolism refers to the chemical reactions required for immune function, and the
reciprocal effects of metabolic products on immune cells [61]. Cell activation results in a
metabolic shift to meet the high energy requirements of anabolism (de novo molecule synthesis)
and energy generation via catabolism [61]. Cytokine signaling and T cell receptor engagement
can trigger upregulation of amino acid, iron, and glucose transporters to fuel the increased
metabolic demands of activated immune cells (reviewed in [62,63]). Immunometabolism has
emerged as an important mechanistic pathway in malnutrition from observations that altered
energy usage in obesity and metabolic syndromes drives immune activation [6], and that
systemic proinflammatory cytokines are elevated together with free fatty acids and ketones
in SAM [10]. Inflammation is reduced in children with SAM following therapeutic feeding [10], and
short-term shifts in fecal and urinary metabolites occur following dietary alterations in under- and
392

 overnutrition [11,13]. Chronic immune activation in malnutrition therefore appears to place high
demands on nutrient metabolism, which are likely intensified by recurrent infection, microbiota
perturbations, and enteropathy (Figure 1).
Specific nutrient deficiencies may influence T cell metabolism via cytoplasmic nutrient sensors
including the glucose sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK/1), which regulates cell
survival post-activation, and the mammalian target of rapamycin serine/threonine kinase com-
plex (mTORc1) [62,63]. Neither AMPK/1 nor mTORc1 activity has been assessed in T cells from
undernourished children; however, both sensors can influence TEM maintenance (reviewed by
[63]), which is impaired in murine PEM [64]. Malnutrition also alters levels of energy homeostasis
mediators, including glucocorticoid hormones of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis
[65] and adipokines released predominantly from adipose tissue [6,7]. Glucocorticoid hormones
regulate inflammation and promote thymic and neurocognitive development [65], which are
impaired in undernourished children (Box 1). Glucocorticoids are also implicated in obesity
because they simultaneously affect adipocyte metabolism and proinflammatory immune medi-
ators. For example, human adipose tissue treated in vitro with dexamethasone (a glucocorticoid)
upregulates genes associated with lipid, carbohydrate, and amino acid metabolism, alongside
leptin and acute phase response genes, but downregulates IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1, compared to
untreated tissue [66]. Despite marked changes in adipose tissue composition, no studies have
investigated the relationship between the HPA axis and inflammation in undernutrition.
Of the adipokines, leptin is the most extensively studied because it transmits signals directly to
the immune system through leukocyte leptin receptors [30,67] and delivers feedback signals to
the HPA axis via mTORc1 activation to indicate satiety [7,67,68]. Ugandan children hospitalized
for SAM had higher serum leptin levels following nutritional rehabilitation, which coincided with
increased insulin and IGF-1, and decreased proinflammatory cytokines [10]. Infants who
survived hospitalization had significantly higher baseline leptin levels than those who died
[10], highlighting the potential importance of leptin signaling for survival in undernutrition.
Mutations in the leptin signaling pathway are risk factors for human obesity [7,67], and
homozygous leptin or leptin receptor deficiency results in excessive eating, early-onset obesity,
and an elevated risk of childhood infections, that occur in parallel with T cell hyporesponsiveness,
low cytokine production, and reduced CD4:CD8 T cell ratios (reviewed in [67]). High-fat diets
have been shown to block mTORc1 activation by leptin in the hypothalamus, which may explain
continued hyperphagia in overnutrition [68].
One hypothesis for the paradoxical link between early-life undernutrition and obesity in adult-
hood (Box 1) is that broad metabolic trajectories become fixed in infancy to reflect environmental
conditions at the time, but can lead to subsequent metabolic maladaptation if the adult
environment changes [4]. Observations from the Dutch Hunger Winter of 1944–1945 corrobo-
rate this hypothesis because infants of mothers exposed to the famine had a higher risk of
glucose intolerance, coronary disease, and obesity than their unexposed siblings, despite
returning to a pre-famine diet after 1945 [9]. Similar to epigenetic programming of infant
immunodeficiency by parental malnutrition, the risk of metabolic syndrome may be epigenetically
programmed. For example, maternal malnutrition during the Dutch Hunger Winter modified the
infant IL10 locus as well as genes associated with growth hormones, cholesterol transport, lipid
metabolism, and the HPA axis that persisted decades later [35]. Infant gender and CpG
methylation of the retinoid-X receptor / (RXRA) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3)
genes explained more than 25% of the variation in childhood adiposity in healthy British 9-year-
olds, and RXRA methylation was higher in infants whose mothers had the lowest carbohydrate
intake during early pregnancy [5]. Heritable immunometabolic changes during malnutrition could
provide a basis for the intergenerational cycle of stunting evident in developing countries (Box 1)
[20]. This hypothesis was recently explored by subjecting 50 generations of Wistar rats to PEM

393
 and micronutrient deficiency, which resulted in animals with low birthweight and stunting
followed by elevated adiposity and insulin resistance relative to their ad libitum-fed counterparts
[69]. Following two generations of ad libitum feeding, rats from the undernourished line had
normal birthweight but retained an enteropathy and metabolic syndrome-prone phenotype
related to histone modification of the insulin 2 (Ins2) promoter [69]. Thus the predisposition to
gastrointestinal, growth, and metabolic defects associated with malnutrition may be imprinted
far earlier than previously assumed [28,70].
Immune Priming and Memory Responses
Infectious deaths in malnourished children could relate to diminished immunological memory
responses to common pathogens. Some studies have identified reduced vaccine-specific
antibody titers and seroconversion rates in children with SAM [23,71,72], but there is limited
evidence for reduced vaccine efficacy in malnutrition [71,72], and few studies have investigated
immunological memory in malnutrition beyond assays of antibody quantity [23,71,72].
An unexplored mechanism that may be relevant to human malnutrition is homeostatic memory
cell maintenance because protection from reinfection relies on antigen-independent persistence
of memory T and B cells primed to respond rapidly upon re-challenge. In PEM mice, proportions
of infection-induced lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)-specific CD44+CD8+ TEM were
reduced, and TEM adoptively transferred from protein-sufficient animals were not maintained
[64]. TEM produced less IFN-g upon LCMV peptide restimulation, and had impaired proliferative
responses and higher viral loads post-challenge, indicative of functionally impaired immunologi-
cal memory to LCMV [64]. In a separate study, PEM mice had more Mycobacterium tuberculosis
bacilli in their lungs and reduced clearance post-vaccination compared to protein-sufficient
mice, which was attributed to reduced lung CD4+ T cell IFN-g, TNF-/, and IL-2 responses to
mycobacterial antigens [73]. It is promising that, in both the LCMV and tuberculosis models,
improved diet led to reconstitution of memory T cell responses and improved pathogen
clearance in malnourished animals [64,73].
The capacity for innate immune cells to generate immunological memory suggests that immu-
nology studies of human malnutrition should extend beyond antibody titers and memory
lymphocytes. Trained immunity is a collective term for the memory-like responses of innate
immune cells that mediate enhanced protection against secondary and heterologous infections
following a primary T and B cell-independent stimulus [74]. Human peripheral blood mononu-
clear cells and purified monocytes exposed to Candida albicans for 24 h in vitro have enhanced
TNF-/ and IL-6 responses to restimulation with LPS, poly I:C, C. albicans, or M. tuberculosis
compared to unprimed cells [75]. These changes in innate cell function, also seen in response to
BCG vaccination [74,76], are related to epigenetic reprogramming of monocytes and changes in
their PRR repertoire [75]. PRR and nutrient receptor expression have not been evaluated in
malnutrition [23]; however, in vitro studies of healthy human cells have begun to investigate
dietary micronutrient effects on trained immunity. Increasing concentrations of vitamin A cause
progressive reduction in TNF-/ and IL-6 production levels, reduced TNF-/, IL-1RA, IL-8, and
IL-10 mRNA transcripts, increased methyl transferase expression, and an altered histone
modification profile in the cytokine promoter regions of LPS-restimulated BCG-trained mono-
cytes [76]. Vitamin A effects on BCG-trained cells could be reversed by inhibiting SUV39H2 [76],
identifying a specific methyltransferase pathway that may be dysregulated by vitamin A
deficiency.
Innate immune cells are also affected by excessive antigen exposure, which reduces their
responsiveness to subsequent stimulation and ability to prime adaptive immune responses.
Immunoparalysis describes the immunosuppressed state that follows acute systemic expo-
sure to proinflammatory stimuli, and this may explain the high rate of secondary infections
394 
Trends in Immunology, June 2016, Vol. 37, No. 6
 following sepsis [77]. Experimental LPS treatment of humans leads to reduced LPS-specific
cytokine responses, lower surface expression of major histocompatibility complex molecules
(HLA-DR) by monocytes, and impaired T cell priming [77]. Given that sepsis is a major cause of
death in children with SAM [78], potentially arising from microbial translocation [51], immu-
noparalysis may compound immunodeficiency in malnutrition. For example, a study of Zambian
children hospitalized for SAM found a negative correlation between T cell proliferation and
plasma LPS levels that was related to DC priming defects [79]. These children had a lower
percentage of myeloid DCs, lower spontaneous DC IL-12 production, and fewer IFN-g+ T cells
following tuberculin stimulation in vitro before compared to after nutritional rehabilitation [79]. Of
the cohort, 17% also exhibited impaired DC maturation (lower HLA-DR upregulation in
response to LPS stimulation in vitro), which was associated with low T cell proliferation
[79]. Therapeutic feeding restored DC numbers, cytokine production, and maturation defects;
however, infants with low DC numbers at admission were less likely to survive than those with
abundant DC [79].
Prognostic Value of Immune Biomarkers for Malnutrition
The evidence discussed in this review suggests that evaluating the prognostic value of immune
biomarkers for malnutrition is warranted. Generating reliable indices of immune function has
been limited to date because most studies have focused on cross-sectional cohorts of acutely
unwell children [23] in whom the relative effects of infection and nutrition cannot be discrimi-
nated. Incorporation of longitudinal immune assessment into ongoing randomized controlled
trials of water/sanitation/hygiene (WASH) and nutritional interventions in developing countries
will be necessary to characterize the nature, timing, and extent of immune dysfunction and the
impact of public health interventions in malnourished infants (e.g., SHINE [80], WASH Benefits
[81], and MAL-ED [82]). Such studies are also necessary in milder forms of malnutrition that are
associated with an elevated risk of infectious mortality [24]. For example, stunting affects almost
one-third of children in developing countries, and there are more deaths from pneumonia and
diarrhea globally among apparently healthy children with stunting than among hospitalized
children with SAM [20]. Ethical and logistical constraints on invasive tissue sampling have
limited biomarker identification of immune dysfunction in gut and adipose tissue. Efforts are
currently being made to define tissue-specific markers of immune function that can be assayed
in non-invasive biological samples such as urine, stool, blood, and saliva [15,82], including
cross-validation of enteropathy biomarkers with direct visualization of the gut by confocal
endomicroscopy [53].
Perhaps as a result of these limitations, associations between individual immune parameters and
malnutrition have been relatively weak to date, compromising their usefulness as biomarkers to
guide clinical interventions. Multiple immune genes are implicated in EED [54], and immune
defects in undernutrition are wide-ranging (Box 2), highlighting that a single pathway is unlikely to
explain the immunopathology of malnutrition. Integrating multiple biomarkers into a single index
can more effectively distinguish between malnourished and adequately nourished children than
individual analytes [15,16], and such statistical approaches could be readily adapted to immu-
nological data. We propose that an immune function-for-age Z score (IAZ) could be used in a
similar way to the microbiota-for-age Z scores (MAZ) generated for Bangladeshi infants [16],
helping to identify malnourished children most at risk of infection. As for MAZ, interpreting IAZ
scores would require large-scale longitudinal assessment of immune development in healthy
‘exemplar’ children [16].
Targeting Immunopathogenic Pathways in Malnutrition
Current nutritional interventions do not fully reverse morbidity or in undernutrition [8], but immune
function is transiently improved following therapeutic feeding both in humans [11,12,79] and
animals [41,64,73]. The roles of defined dietary nutrients in immune priming and gut function
Trends in Immunology, June 2016, Vol. 37, No. 6 
395
 [38,49] support development of therapeutic foods to promote immune recovery in malnutrition
(immunonutrition). Specific formulations have been developed for critically ill patients; however,
meta-analyses and large-scale clinical trials are inconclusive on whether immunonutrition affects
infections or mortality [83].
Few studies have directly targeted immune pathways in malnourished children; however,
standard protocols for SAM treatment include antibiotics [84], which can reduce mortality
and improve nutritional recovery [85]. The mechanisms through which antibiotics improve
outcomes in malnutrition are unclear, but may include treating clinical and subclinical
infections, reducing chronic inflammation or ameliorating enteropathy through changes in
the microbiota [85]; antibiotic effects on immune function have not been evaluated. A
complementary therapeutic approach would be to target inflammation using anti-inflamma-
tory drugs. A promising pilot study of mesalazine in children with SAM and EED showed
trends towards reduced markers of gut inflammation (fecal calprotectin) and microbial
translocation (anti-LPS IgG) relative to placebo-treated controls [56]. Furthermore, several
studies provide proof-of-principle that targeting immunopathogenesis in malnutrition is
feasible. For example, 4 years of daily subcutaneous leptin injections reversed immune
defects in obese children with congenital leptin deficiency [86]. A study of LPS challenge in
healthy humans also demonstrated that in vivo administration of IFN-g, and to a lesser extent
GM-CSF, restored LPS-specific TNF-/ responses [77], indicating that immunoparalysis can
be safely and effectively reversed. Timing of interventions targeting immune dysfunction will
likely be a crucial determinant of their efficacy. Although immunodeficiency presents during
the first 1000 days, pre-conception interventions in mothers and fathers may be necessary
to target the epigenetic origins of undernutrition [5,32–34] and the associated predisposition
to adult metabolic syndromes [4,9].
Concluding Remarks
It has long been apparent that infectious mortality is elevated in undernutrition and obesity
(Box 1) and that immunodeficiency is a hallmark of malnutrition (Box 2). In this review we
have summarized data demonstrating that immune dysfunction is not only a consequence of
inadequate diet but also contributes directly to mortality and morbidity associated with
malnutrition. Emerging data from animal models and human cohorts indicate that immune
dysfunction underlies the etiology of malnutrition early in the life-course, through epigenetic
modifications of infant immune genes; the influence of chronic inflammation on growth
hormones, HPA signaling, adiposity and metabolism; altered gut structure and function;
reduced immune-mediated protection from infections [63,64,79]; and the interplay between
environment, nutrition, and immune development (Figure 1). A causal role for immune
dysfunction in human undernutrition has been postulated in light of associations between
elevated inflammatory mediators at birth and subsequent stunting [14], as well as consistent
indications that inflammation dysregulates growth hormones [14,56,58]. Metabolic defects
conferred via epigenetic modification of immune genes can be inherited by the adequately
nourished offspring of malnourished fathers [36,37] and from ancestors exposed to deficient
diets several generations earlier [69]. More broadly, immune dysfunction in malnourished
mothers has a causal impact on infant nutritional status because reduced transfer of
protective maternal immune factors and increased exposure to pathogenic microbes and
proinflammatory mediators confer an elevated metabolic cost on developing infants [20].
Few of the pathways linking malnutrition and immune dysfunction in murine experiments, in
vitro studies, and human overnutrition have been well defined in undernutrition; we therefore
propose a series of research questions that urgently need to be addressed in future studies
(see Outstanding Questions). Better understanding the role of the immune system in
malnutrition will inform targeted interventions for vulnerable children with undernutrition,
where there is a crucial need for new approaches to reduce global mortality.
Outstanding Questions
Immune Development. What is the tra-
jectory of healthy immune development
in early life, and how is this perturbed in
malnutrition? Identifying the functional
characteristics of ‘immune faltering’,
and the age at which it emerges, will
identify optimal timings for therapeutic
interventions.
Is there a relationship between breast-
milk components, infant immune func-
tion, and subsequent growth defects?

tion for infants at risk of stunting.
How is the immunoepigenome at birth

nome and subsequent immune func-
tion during early life?
Gut Immune Responses. Does expres-
sion of nutrient-sensing receptors and
PRRs by human immune cells differ
according to nutritional status? Is this
evident systemically or restricted to
mucosal sites?
What is the relationship between micro-
biota-for-age and immune function-for-
age 
in 
healthy 
and 
malnourished
infants? Given that the microbiota and
immune system have reciprocal effects,
it will also be important to determine
whether this relationship changes in
response to different therapeutic inter-
ventions (e.g., feeding, antibiotics, anti-
inflammatory treatment).
Which mucosal cell types drive enter-
opathy in human EED? Is there a sys-
temic immune biomarker of EED?
Immunometabolism. Is the immunome-
tabolic profile in infant malnutrition related
to immunopathology in adulthood?
Do adipokine and glucocorticoid hor-
mone levels differ according to the
severity of malnutrition? Are their levels
related to immune function in the
periphery, gut, or adipose tissue?
Immune Priming and Memory. Does
undernutrition alter effector memory T
cell function or trained immunity? Func-
tional assays of immune priming and
memory will be particularly pertinent to
understanding the relationship between
malnutrition and infectious mortality.
