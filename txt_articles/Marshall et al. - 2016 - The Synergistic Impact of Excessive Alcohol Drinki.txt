The independent use of excessive amounts of alcohol or persistent cigarette smoking 
have been found to have a deleterious impact upon Prospective Memory (PM: remem-
bering future intentions and activities), although to date, the effect of their concurrent use 
upon PM is yet to be explored. The present study investigated the impact of the concur-
rent use of drinking excessive amounts of alcohol and smoking cigarettes (a “Polydrug” 
group) in comparison to the combined effect of the single use of these substances upon 
PM. The study adopted a single factorial independent groups design. The Cambridge 
Prospective Memory Test (CAMPROMPT) is a test of both time-based and event-based 
PM and was used here to measure PM. The CAMPROMPT was administered to 125 
adults; an excessive alcohol user group (n = 40), a group of smokers who drink very little 
alcohol (n = 20), a combined user group (the “Polydrug” group) who drink excessively 
and smoke cigarettes (n = 40) and a non-drinker/low alcohol consumption control 
group (n = 25). The main findings revealed that the Polydrug users recalled significantly 
fewer time-based PM tasks than both excessive alcohol users p < 0.001 and smokers 
p = 0.013. Polydrug users (mean = 11.47) also remembered significantly fewer event-
based PM tasks than excessive alcohol users p < 0.001 and smokers p = 0.013. With 
regards to the main aim of the study, the polydrug users exhibited significantly greater 
impaired time-based PM than the combined effect of single excessive alcohol users and 
cigarette smokers p = 0.033. However, no difference was observed between polydrug 
users and the combined effect of single excessive alcohol users and cigarette smokers 
in event-based PM p = 0.757. These results provide evidence that concurrent (polydrug) 
use of these two substances has a synergistic effect in terms of deficits upon time-based 
PM. The observation that combined excessive drinking and cigarette smoking leads to 
a greater impairment in time-based PM may be of paramount importance, given the key 
role PM plays in everyday independent living.

Tobacco and alcohol are two of the most widely used drugs in the Western world and are responsible 
for a large proportion of harm (1). These two drugs are often used concurrently (2, 3); yet, there 
remains a paucity of research in relation to their combined effects. The relationship between these 
drugs is complex and not presently well understood; this is surprising given the synergistic health

risks posed by such polydrug use (4). Previous research sug-
gests that chronic use of large amounts of alcohol and cigarette 
smoking are independently associated with a variety of cogni-
tive impairments. For example, studies that have examined the 
effects of alcohol on cognitive performance and have shown that 
drinking excessively impairs Working Memory (WM), which is 
responsible for the manipulation and maintenance of informa-
tion across a short period of time; for example, remembering 
someone’s phone number while driving a car and concentrating 
on the road ahead (5, 6) as well as Executive Function (EF), which 
is an umbrella term used to describe a set of resources that are 
responsible for the management of cognitive functions, includ-
ing WM and attention; for example, being able to pay attention 
to a task despite having distractions all around you (7, 8). More 
recently, excessive alcohol use has been associated with poorer 
performance in Prospective Memory (PM), which refers to the 
cognitive ability to carry out planned intentions/actions at a 
future point in time (9–11). Excessive alcohol drinking is defined 
as either drinking in excess of the current cut-off limits for safe 
drinking, which are 14/21 U of alcohol per week for females and 
males, respectively (12, 13). It should be noted that a UK unit 
(8 g ethanol) contains 0.343 US fluid ounces of ethanol. Chronic 
cigarette smoking has also been associated with deficits in these 
domains, including WM (14, 15), EF (16, 17), and PM (18–20). 
PM is seen as an important part of everyday remembering, since 
it is responsible for planning and remembering future activities, 
such as remembering to meet with friends at a pre-specified time 
and location, remembering to take an important medication on 
time, or remembering to turn up for a meeting; in this respect, it 
is seen as essential for independent living (21).
Prospective memory involves both time-based (an action 
that is carried out after a specific time period has elapsed; for 
example, remembering to take an important medication after a 
specific time has elapsed) and event-based (an action executed as 
the result of an environmental cue; for example, remembering to 
pass on a message to someone whom you meet in the street). It 
has been suggested that the subtypes rely upon different cognitive 
mechanisms; event-based involves spontaneous retrieval while 
time-based requires attentional monitoring and as such time-
based may be more reliant upon executive resources (22). There 
is evidence to suggest that event-based and time-based PM are, at 
least in part, separable. For example, time-based, but not event-
based PM deficits were found in a patient with bilateral frontal 
lobe infarcts (23); whereas Parkinson’s disease patients have been 
found to be impaired on the event-based, but not on time-based, 
PM tasks (24), suggesting a dissociation between the two pro-
cesses. In addition, research using Positron Emission Tomography 
(PET) brain imaging has found evidence of differential involve-
ment of prefrontal regions in time-based and event-based PM 
(25). Although there is a paucity of research focusing upon the 
combined effect of alcohol and tobacco use upon cognition and 
memory, there is some. Evidence in relation to the interactive 
effect between excessive alcohol use and smoking is evident in 
other areas of cognition. Cigarette smoking has been found to 
exacerbate cognitive deficits in those who drink alcohol exces-
sively, including memory deficits, one’s ability to think quickly 
and efficiently, as well as on problem solving tasks (26). Recently, 
evidence has shown that alcohol-dependant individuals who 
smoke cigarettes show greater neuropsychological damage than 
those who do not smoke (27); observing decreased cortical thick-
ness in the polydrug users, with greater thinning in frontal areas 
of the cortex (a key brain region involved in PM). The combined 
effect of smoking and alcohol has also recently been linked with 
faster cognitive decline in such polydrug users, compared with 
alcohol users alone (28), indicating that cigarette smoking and 
excessive alcohol use may act in synergy to cause increased cogni-
tive decline. In addition to this greater deficits in EF [believed 
to rely on the same cognitive processes as PM: (29)] have been 
found in such polydrug user groups compared to alcohol users 
alone. Given the cumulative evidence that the combined use of 
excessive amounts of alcohol and cigarette smoking may damage 
pre-frontal regions of the brain and may accelerate declines in 
cognitive processes such as EF, it is possible that the combined 
use of these two substances may exacerbate declines in PM when 
compared with the single use of these substances.
The main aim of the study is to explore whether the combined 
(polydrug) effect of consuming excessive amounts of alcohol and 
smoking cigarettes is greater than the sum of their independent 
effects. This will be achieved by comparing the added effects of 
both single user groups (an excessive drinking group and a ciga-
rette smoking group) with a polydrug group (those who drink 
alcohol excessively and smoke cigarettes) in order to determine 
whether there is a significant difference between these with regards 
PM. This should provide insight as to whether the combination of 
these two substances has an additive or synergistic impact upon 
PM function. Since PM involves both time and event-based tasks, 
the Cambridge Prospective Memory Test (CAMPROMPT) was 
utilized here as a measure of both time and event-based PM.

Design
An existing groups design was employed comparing four groups: 
(1) an “Excessive Alcohol” group who drank excessive amounts 
of alcohol but who did not smoke cigarettes; (2) a “Cigarette 
Smokers” group who smoked cigarettes on a regular/daily basis 
and drank very little alcohol; (3) a “Polydrug” group who drank 
excessively and smoked cigarettes on a regular/daily basis; and 
(4) a “Control” group who drank low amounts of alcohol who 
had never smoked cigarettes. Excessive alcohol drinking was 
classified as those individuals who drank in excess of the current 
cut-off limits for safe drinking, which are 14/21 U of alcohol 
(females and males respectively) per week, as described in the 
Section “Introduction.” The dependent measures included both 
time-based and event-based CAMPROMPT scores.
Participants
One-hundred and twenty-five unpaid volunteers were recruited as 
participants through opportunity sampling, which involved tak-
ing a sample of people who responded via advertisements about 
the study and who fit the criteria for which the researchers were 
looking. The inclusion criteria was anyone who fell in to one of 
the four groupings identified above; therefore any person who was

either an excessive drinker (drinking above the 14/21 U of alcohol 
per week described above), a regular cigarette smoker who drank 
very little (ranging from 0 to 7 U of alcohol per week), a polydrug 
user who drank excessively and smoked cigarettes regularly, or a 
non-smoker who consumed very little (if any) alcohol. The study 
was advertised widely around the university, and the inclusion 
criteria were made clear so that we could ensure recruitment to 
all of the groups. Anyone who reported using other substances, 
such as cannabis, ecstasy, heroin, cocaine, “legal highs,” etc., were 
excluded from the study. Anyone who reported having previously 
suffered from/were currently suffering from, a clinical disorder 
(such as amnesia, depression, or substance dependence), were 
excluded from the study. The age range of participants was 
between 18 and 43 years. Participants were allocated to a group 
based upon their alcohol and cigarette use. Excessive alcohol was 
determined by the participant’s weekly alcohol usage (regardless 
of any specific pattern of drinking, such as “binge drinking”), 
which was whether they exceeded the 14/21 U of alcohol per 
week for females and males, respectively (12, 13). The Excessive 
Alcohol group contained 40 participants (25 females) who had 
never smoked, and their mean alcohol intake per week was 25.9 U 
(SD 8.60). The Cigarette Smokers group consisted of 20 partici-
pants (14 females) who smoked on a regular/daily basis, but did 
not consume alcohol on a regular basis and drank low amounts 
of alcohol; they smoked on average 69.3 cigarettes per week (SD 
47.7). The Polydrug group contained 40 participants (16 females) 
who smoked cigarettes on a regular/daily basis and drank exces-
sively; their mean alcohol consumption was 26.5 U per week (SD 
6.88), and their mean cigarettes usage per week was 52.5 cigarettes 
(SD 27.2). The Control group consisted of 25 participants (19 
females) who were low-dose alcohol users/non-users who did not 
smoke; their mean alcohol consumption per week was 1.46 U (SD 
2.38). The Excessive Alcohol and Polydrug groups did not differ 
in terms of the amount of alcohol they consumed per week, nor 
in terms of the years spent drinking alcohol or their last alcohol 
use in hours. The Cigarette Smokers and Polydrug groups did not 
differ in terms of the amount of cigarettes they smoked per week 
or in terms of their last cigarette use in hours, but the Cigarette 
Smokers group had been smoking for longer than the Polydrug 
group. The distribution of male and female participants between 
the groups did differ significantly. See the Section “Results” for 
analysis of these non-memory measures.
Measures
The Cambridge Prospective Memory Test (CAMPROMPT) is 
a valid and reliable measure of time-based and event-based PM 
(30) and was utilized in the current study as an objective measure 
of both time and event-based PM. The test consists of three time-
based tasks, which require the participant to carry out a task at a 
specific time; a clock was available for them to monitor the time 
(for example, “In seven minutes, I would like you to change the 
pen you are using”) and three event-based tasks, which require the 
participant to carry out a task in response to a cue (for example, 
“When you come to a quiz question about ‘Eastenders’ I would 
like you to give me this book”). The time-based and event-based 
tasks were to be remembered while completing a set of distracter 
tasks comprising a set of puzzles. Points were scored for each of 
the six tasks and the scoring per task ranged from 6 (where the 
participant completed task unaided) to 0 (where they have failed 
to complete task), with points between these two on the scale 
for tasks completed with some prompting from the researcher. 
Two types of PM scores were obtained: a time-based PM score 
(out of a maximum of 18) and an event-based PM score (out 
of a maximum of 18), with the higher score reflecting a more 
proficient PM.
Alcohol use, smoking, and other drug use were measured using 
a modified version of the University of East London Recreational 
Drug Use Questionnaire [RDUQ: (31)]. This questionnaire asked 
the participant to report their drinking and smoking pattern over 
a typical week, including quantities and the number of units of 
alcohol/cigarettes, hours since last use and years spent using 
alcohol/cigarettes. Participants were further asked to state any 
other drug use, such as cannabis and ecstasy, and amount and 
frequency of use.
Procedure
Prior to commencement, the research protocol was approved 
by the School of Health and Life Sciences Ethics Committee at 
Northumbria University. All testing was carried out in a laboratory 
setting, taking approximately 30 min to complete. Participation 
was voluntary. The CAMPROMPT was administered first, in 
which participants were asked to complete a set of puzzles and 
quizzes, while being asked by the researcher to remember to carry 
out the time-based and event-based memory tasks; this lasted 
approximately 25 min. Participants were then asked to complete 
the RDUQ questionnaire, which took only a few minutes. Upon 
completion, participants were debriefed, any questions they had 
were answered and they were given the opportunity to withdraw 
their data from the study (none did so).
resUlTs
In order to identify that the Polydrug user group was appro-
priately matched to the respective single drug user groups, a 
series of one-way ANOVAs were applied to the data comparing 
appropriate groups on alcohol use and smoking. The Excessive 
Alcohol group and Polydrug group were compared on the 
amount of alcohol consumed per week, the number of years 
spent drinking alcohol, and the number of hours since they 
last drank alcohol (see Table 1 for the means and standard 
deviations (SDs) for these measures across the groups). The 
Cigarette Smokers group and Polydrug group were compared 
on the number of cigarettes smoked per week, the number of 
years spent smoking, and the number of hours since their last 
cigarette was used (see Table 1 for the means and SDs for these 
measures across the groups). The analyses revealed no significant 
differences between the Excessive Alcohol and Polydrug groups 
in terms of the number of alcohol units consumed per week 
[F(1,78) = 0.150, p = 0.699], the number of years spent drinking 
alcohol [F(1,78) = 0.153, p = 0.697], and hours since they last 
drank alcohol [F(1,78) = 0.414, p = 0.522]. No significant dif-
ference was observed between the Cigarette Smokers group and 
Polydrug Group in terms of the amount of cigarettes smoked 
per week [F(1,58) = 3.001, p = 0.089] and number of hours

since their last cigarette [F(1,58) = 0.034, p = 0.855]; however 
there was a significant difference in terms of the number of years 
for which participants had smoked cigarettes [F(1,58) = 8.624, 
p = 0.005] – with the Cigarette Smokers group having smoked 
for longer than the Polydrug group. In summary, there were no 
significant between group differences between excessive alcohol 
use and smoking pattern for the potential confounding variables, 
other than years spent smoking.
A multivariate MANOVA was applied to the data in order to 
identify whether CAMPROMPT event-based and time-based 
differences existed between the Polydrug group and the two sin-
gle user groups. This revealed a significant effect of group on the 
dependent measures [Wilk’s Lambda = 0.636, F (4,192) = 12.182, 
p < 0.001; ηp2 = 0.20]. This analysis indicated a significant effect 
associated with the time-based CAMPROMPT [F(2,97) = 24.367, 
p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.33] and a significant effect associated with the 
event-based measure [F(2,97) = 10.799, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.18]. 
Bonferroni adjusted post hoc analysis revealed that with regard 
to event-based PM, the Polydrug group (mean = 11.47; SD 3.34) 
remembered significantly fewer actions than Excessive Alcohol 
group (mean = 14.27; SD 2.35), p < 0.001, and that the Polydrug 
users also remembered significantly fewer event-based actions 
than the Cigarette Smokers group (mean = 13.85; SD 2.52), 
p = 0.008. With regard to time-based PM, the Polydrug group 
(mean = 9.77; SD 3.99) remembered significantly fewer PM 
actions than Excessive Alcohol group (mean = 14.67; SD 2.41), 
p < 0.001, and that the Polydrug users also remembered signifi-
cantly fewer time-based items than the Cigarette Smokers group 
(mean = 12.30; SD 2.39), p = 0.012.
To address the main aim of whether the combined (polydrug) 
effect of consuming excessive amounts of alcohol and smoking 
cigarettes is greater than the sum of their independent effects, 
the CAMPROMPT impairment of the Polydrug Group was 
contrasted with the combined impairment of the two single user 
groups (the Excessive Alcohol group and Cigarette Smokers 
group). Specific impairment of the two single user groups was 
identified by comparing their mean performance with that of the 
Control group performance on both CAMPROMPT measures. In 
the event-based CAMPROMPT measure, the Control mean per-
formance was 16.48 (SD 2.48), and the Excessive Alcohol and the 
Cigarette Smokers group achieved 14.27 and 13.85, respectively. 
Thus, the specific impairments for these two user groups were; 
Excessive Alcohol, 16.48 − 14.27 = 2.21, and Cigarette Smokers, 
16.48 − 13.85 = 2.63. The combined event-based impairment 
level was therefore = 2.21 + 2.63 = 4.84. This combined baseline 
impairment value is shown in Figure 1A below by the horizontal 
dashed line.
In the time-based CAMPROMPT measure, the Control 
mean performance was 15.80 (SD 2.00). Thus, the specific 
impairments for these two user groups were; Excessive Alcohol, 
15.80 − 14.67 = 1.13, and Cigarette Smokers, 15.80 − 12.30 = 3.50. 
The combined time-based impairment level was therefore 4.63, 
and this combined impairment value is shown by the horizontal 
dashed line in Figure 1B below. In order to identify whether

the Polydrug impairment (in comparison to the control group 
performance) was greater than the combined single user deficits, 
two one-sample t-tests were conducted with the respective 
combined impairments as the criteria. In relation to event-based 
PM, there was no significant difference between the Polydrug 
groups’ impairment and the combined single user impairment, 
[t(39) = −0.312, p = 0.757]. In relation to time-based PM, the 
Polydrug groups’ impairment was significantly greater than 
the combination of single user impairments [t(39) = −2.243, 
p = 0.031].
In summary, significantly more time-based and event-based 
PM errors were made by the Polydrug user group in comparison 
to both Excessive Alcohol user group and Cigarette Smoker 
groups. Importantly, further analysis revealed that the polydrug 
group also made significantly more PM errors that the combined 
effect of excessive alcohol and cigarette smoking in time-based 
PM, although not in event-based PM.
DiscUssiOn
The present study explored whether the combined (polydrug) 
effect of consuming excessive amounts of alcohol and smoking 
cigarettes is greater than the sum of their independent effects. 
This was achieved by comparing the added deficits for each of the 
single user groups (the Excessive alcohol drinkers and cigarette 
smokers group) with the polydrug group (those who both drink 
alcohol excessively and smoke cigarettes) to determine whether 
there was a significant difference between these two in terms of 
time-based and event-based PM function using the Cambridge 
Prospective Memory Test (CAMPROMPT) as the main measure 
of PM. With regards to this aim, the prospective memory (PM) 
deficits observed in the Polydrug group (those who drank exces-
sive amounts of alcohol and smoked cigarettes) was found to be 
greater than the combined deficits of the two single user groups 
(the Excessive alcohol group and the Cigarette Smoker group) in 
relation to time-based PM, suggesting a synergistic interactive 
effect rather than an additive interactive effect of these two sub-
stances. No such effect was observed in relation to event-based 
PM. These effects were found after observing no significant differ-
ences between these groups in the amount of alcohol consumed 
per week, the number of years drinking alcohol, the number of 
hours since they last drank alcohol, the number of cigarettes 
smoked per week, and in terms of the number of hours since 
last cigarette. These findings indicate that, using both substances 
together produces greater deficits than single use of either 
substance and furthermore, the interaction between excessive 
amounts of alcohol and cigarettes produces greater deficits upon 
time-based PM than the sum of their separate effects – suggesting 
a synergistic effect of combined excessive drinking and smoking 
upon time-based PM. These findings firstly lend support to the 
body of research, which has previously found that drinking alco-
hol and smoking cigarettes separately, is associated with impaired 
PM (9–11, 18–20), but extends this by observing a synergistic 
effect of the combined use of excessive amounts of alcohol and 
cigarette smoking on time-based PM deficits when compared 
with their single separate use. Although smoking has been found 
to exacerbate cognitive deficits in excessive alcohol users in the 
past (26–28), the current study is the first to show this effect for 
prospective remembering. Given the importance of PM to every-
day activities (21), this finding may be important in terms of its 
suggestion that everyday memory (of which PM is a very good 
example) may be compromised by the combination of excessive 
drinking and cigarette smoking in a non-clinical population.
Although this study has demonstrated synergistic effects of 
excessive drinking and smoking upon PM, the putative under-
lying damage to the mechanisms underpinning such deficits 
remains unclear. PM is believed to be a function underpinned 
by multiple cognitive processes rather than being a single con-
struct in its own right; thus, it is difficult to identify a specific 
region or mechanism in the brain that may account for the PM 
deficits caused by excessive alcohol use, smoking, and polydrug 
use. However, both excessive alcohol use and smoking have been 
found to impair frontal lobe tasks such as EF (16, 32). Given 
previous clinical evidence that excessive alcohol users who also 
smoke show decreased cortical thickness, with greater thinning 
in frontal areas of the cortex (a key brain region involved in PM) 
compared with heavy drinking who do not smoke (27), it is pos-
sible that the deficits in PM found in the polydrug group in the 
current study may be the result of frontal lobe dysfunction. Given 
that the combination of drinking heavily and smoking cigarettes 
also leads to significant deficits in EF (28), which is heavily 
involved in frontal lobe resources and is believed to underpin PM 
(29), this lends further support to the notion that it is the frontal 
lobe region that is affected by the combined use excessive alcohol 
drinking and cigarette smoking. This could be explored further 
by the use of brain imaging (such as PET) alongside a measure 
of PM (such as CAMPROMPT) in order to observe the degree 
of frontal lobe activity during the PM task in the polydrug users 
compared with suitable controls. Again, one must be cautious 
given the evidence from neuroimaging studies which have also 
implicated other regions, such as the hippocampus and thalamus 
in PM (33–35). It is therefore possible that any putative damage 
as a result of polydrug use may well be indicative of damage that 
is not confined to the frontal region itself; again, brain imaging 
techniques could be used in combination with the CAMPROMPT 
in order to elucidate the links between polydrug use, PM deficits 
and any underlying neuropsychological damage. The fact that 
this synergistic effect (i.e., the finding that polydrug user group 
showed greater PM deficits than the combined deficits of both 
single user groups) was evident only for time-based PM task is 
explicable in terms of time-based PM being more reliant upon 
frontal lobe processes (21), and therefore, if the frontal lobes are 
being damaged/depleted by the combination of drinking exces-
sively and smoking cigarettes, then one would expect to find this 
for the time-based tasks and not for the event-based tasks (as was 
the case in the findings of the current study). This suggests that 
event-based PM may operate on a different neural network than 
that of time-based PM, a point that could be pursued in future 
research. It may also be worth noting that, since nicotine is seen 
to act as neuroprotective (36), the contributing factor of cigarette 
smoking to this synergistic effect on PM must come from the tox-
ins contained in cigarette smoke and inhaled by smokers, these 
toxins combined with excessive alcohol use must act together to 
damage or deplete those resources in the brain that underpin PM, 
 6

future research may wish to explore which of these 70 plus toxins 
contained in tobacco smoke interact with excessive alcohol use to 
produce a detrimental impact upon everyday memory.
cOnclUsiOn anD liMiTaTiOns
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine 
the synergistic impact of combined excessive alcohol use and 
cigarette smoking upon everyday PM. The findings revealed that 
individuals who consumed excessive amounts of alcohol and also 
smoked cigarettes demonstrated significantly greater deficits in 
time-based PM than the combined deficits from the single use of 
either excessive alcohol or cigarette smoking, suggesting a syner-
gistic interactive effect rather than an additive effect of these two 
substances. It is our hope that the findings uncovered here will 
help to improve our understanding about the dangers of exces-
sive drinking and smoking beyond the mainly health concerns 
highlighted in the literature by providing a greater understanding 
of the cognitive consequences of such polydrug use. Specifically, 
highlighting the dangers of combined heavy alcohol use and 
smoking in relation to everyday memory, in this case PM.
There are a number of limitations that should be considered 
when interpreting the findings form this study. One limitation 
of the study is the reliance on self-reported drug use, which 
can be problematic given that it relies upon the honesty and 
accuracy of the individual. Although the RDUQ (used in the 
current study to measure substance use) has been used in several 
studies to measure alcohol, smoking, and other substance use 
(9–11, 18–20, 31); its utility when compared with other substance 
use measures has not been tested, which should be considered 
when considering its use in future studies. Future research should 
overcome this by utilizing biological drug-screening techniques 
that provide objective and more accurate measures of alcohol 
and other drug use, for example the use of blood, urine and 
hair assays. The study asked anyone who used other substances 
(such as cannabis, ecstasy, etc.) or who had suffered from/were 
currently suffering from, a clinical disorder (such as amnesia, 
depression, or substance dependence), to refrain from taking 
part in the study as a method of screening participants. However, 
these were not assessed by biological assays (for measures of drug 
use) or clinical testing (for clinical disorders). This can be seen 
as a limitation of the present study, particularly given the fact 
that there is evidence that polydrug use is associated with greater 
health risks than single drug use (37), that polydrug use is more 
prevalent in psychiatric populations (38) and is associated with 
elevated levels of psychiatric conditions, such as aggression and 
suicide (39), when compared with single user groups. In addition, 
given that polydrug users differ from single drug user groups in 
terms of personality factors, such as exhibiting higher levels of 
impulsivity and a greater propensity for risk taking (40–42), per-
sonality factors should also be taken into account in future work. 
Therefore, future research should utilize biological methods to 
more accurately assess substance use, as well as include health, 
personality, and psychiatric indices to compile a fuller picture of 
how polydrug users and single drug users differ on these domains 
and to measure what impact, if any, these domains might have 
upon everyday memory in the form of PM.
Although the present study has uncovered a synergistic effect 
of excessive alcohol use and smoking upon PM, future research 
should attempt to replicate these findings using more ecologically 
valid PM tasks. This could be achieved by the use of real-world 
PM tasks such as remembering to carry out an activity after a 
period of time has passed (e.g., remember to text the researcher 
24 h following the completion of the study) or the use of the diary 
method, both of which have proven useful in measuring PM defi-
cits in clinical populations (43) or the recent use of virtual reality 
techniques to measure PM (44). Finally, given the frequency 
with which adolescents drink heavily and smoke, future research 
should investigate the impact of heavy drinking and smoking 
in the period of adolescence to upon the developing adolescent 
brain (45). Since tobacco smoking and alcohol use are two of the 
most widely used drugs in the Western world; and given the fact 
that they inflict a great deal of harm upon society and the fact 
that these two drugs are often used concurrently, a much greater 
understanding is needed with regards the cognitive consequences 
of combined cigarette smoking and excessive alcohol use.
