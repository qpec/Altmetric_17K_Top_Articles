Community antimicrobial resistance rates are high in communities with frequent use of nonprescription antibiotics. Studies
addressing nonprescription antibiotic use in the United States have been restricted to Latin American immigrants. We estimated
the prevalence of nonprescription antibiotic use in the previous 12 months as well as intended use (intention to use antibiotics
without a prescription) and storage of antibiotics and examined patient characteristics associated with nonprescription use in a
random sample of adults. We selected private and public primary care clinics that serve ethnically and socioeconomically diverse
patients. Within the clinics, we used race/ethnicity-stratified systematic random sampling to choose a random sample of primary
care patients. We used a self-administered standardized questionnaire on antibiotic use. Multivariate regression analysis was
used to identify independent predictors of nonprescription use. The response rate was 94%. Of 400 respondents, 20 (5%) re-
ported nonprescription use of systemic antibiotics in the last 12 months, 102 (25.4%) reported intended use, and 57 (14.2%)
stored antibiotics at home. These rates were similar across race/ethnicity groups. Sources of antibiotics used without prescrip-
tions or stored for future use were stores or pharmacies in the United States, “leftover” antibiotics from previous prescriptions,
antibiotics obtained abroad, or antibiotics obtained from a relative or friend. Respiratory symptoms were common reasons for
the use of nonprescription antibiotics. In multivariate analyses, public clinic patients, those with less education, and younger
patients were more likely to endorse intended use. The problem of nonprescription use is not confined to Latino communities.
Community antimicrobial stewardship must include a focus on nonprescription antibiotics.
T
he potential harms of antibiotic use, especially the emergence
of resistant pathogens, are garnering increasing global atten-
tion (1, 2). A major driver of antimicrobial resistance is the misuse
of antibiotics (3). Community antimicrobial resistance rates are
high in communities with frequent use of nonprescription antibi-
otics (4, 5). The World Health Organization encourages prescrip-
tion-only use of antibiotics in an effort to improve the rational use
of antimicrobials (6). Nonprescription use may be of concern for
the development of resistant organisms because it may involve
very short courses, inappropriate drug and dose choices, and
unnecessary therapy (4). Other potential problems associated
with nonprescription use include adverse drug reactions, drug
interactions, masking of underlying infectious processes, su-
perinfection, and other harms, including the effect of antibiot-
ics on microbiota (4).
Surveys addressing nonprescription antibiotic use in the United
States have been restricted to Latin American immigrants (7, 8).
Within these ethnic groups, 19% of individuals acquired antibiot-
ics in the United States without a prescription, and 16% trans-
ported nonprescribed antibiotics from another country (7). In
another study, antibiotics were available without a prescription in
all private, independent pharmacies or groceries in the Hispanic
neighborhood studied in New York City (9). Other sources of
nonprescription antibiotic use may include antibiotics “left over”
from previous treatment courses or obtained from relatives or
friends. Intended use (intention to use antibiotics without a pre-
scription or medical guidance) and storage of unused antibiotics
at home are facilitating factors for actual nonprescription use. In a
study including 19 European countries, intended self-medication
and storage of antibiotics were strong independent predictors of
actual nonprescription use in the past 12 months (10).
We estimated the prevalences of nonprescription antibiotic
use, intended use, and storage of antibiotics in a socioeconomi-
cally and ethnically diverse sample of adult patients from private
and public primary care clinics. We also examined patient char-
acteristics associated with nonprescription use, the types of anti-
biotics used, the sources of nonprescription use, and the symp-
toms for which the antibiotics were reportedly used.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sampling, setting, and participants. The survey was conducted between
April and August 2015 in the waiting rooms of three primary care clinics
representing a public health care delivery system and a private practice
network in a large, urban area. The two public clinics serve a diverse,
predominantly uninsured and underinsured patient population. The one
private clinic serves primarily managed care and privately insured pa-
tients.
Our multistage sampling design took into account the fact that many
probability-based sampling designs (e.g., random-digit-dialing telephone
survey or mail survey from a published address list) would not adequately
access minority residents. Therefore, we selected private and public pri-

Downloaded from 
 mary care clinics that serve ethnically and socioeconomically diverse
patients and used race/ethnicity-stratified sampling to reflect the racial/
ethnic makeup of the population of Harris County, TX. With more than
4.5 million residents, Harris County is the most populous county in the
state and one of the largest in the country, with 42% of residents being
Hispanic or Latino, 20% being black or African American, and 38% being
non-Hispanic (including white, Asian, and other racial/ethnic groups)
(11). Within the clinics, we used race/ethnicity-stratified systematic ran-
dom sampling to choose a sample of adults. The clinic staff gave a flyer to
every third patient who checked in for a primary care visit. The flyer
introduced the study and asked the patient to approach the study research
coordinator if the patient was interested in participating. The research
coordinator invited study volunteers to complete a short questionnaire
about their use of antibiotics. The questionnaires were completed anon-
ymously in the respondent’s preferred language (English or Spanish). For
their reference, respondents were provided a list of brand and generic
names of commonly used antibiotics in the United States and Latin Amer-
ican countries. Exclusion criteria were an age of �18 years and an inability
or unwillingness to complete a short questionnaire. The study was ap-
proved by the Baylor College of Medicine Institutional Review Board
(IRB).
Sample size. The prevalence of nonprescription antibiotic use among
Latin American immigrants in previous studies conducted in the United
States was 19 to 26%. If the maximum expected prevalence is 26%, to
obtain a precision of 0.05, the sample size needed is 296. To adjust for
possible nonresponse, we selected 400 participants.
Instrument. The self-administered questionnaire was modified from
a previously pretested and standardized questionnaire used in a 19-coun-
try pan-European survey on the prevalence of self-medication with anti-
biotics (10). We created a Spanish version of the questionnaire using a
combination of committee translation and standard back-translation
strategies to achieve semantic equivalence. During this process, a panel of
five bilingual translators from a community health research background
provided feedback on any phrasing that was not comparable in meaning,
formatting that could be confusing, and other concerns that could impact
the ability of the patient to understand or respond to the questions. After
this procedure was completed, the translators and two of the investigators
reviewed the translation and reached a consensus on the final version of
the questionnaire, which had a sixth-grade reading level, as assessed by the
Flesch-Kincaid method (25). The questionnaire was pretested with a con-
venience sample of English- and Spanish-speaking individuals with vari-
ous levels of education, and some minor changes were made prior to
administration (see the supplemental material).
Questions asked about the respondent’s use of antibiotics during the
past 12 months, how the antibiotics were obtained, whether they were
stored at home, and whether the respondent would consider using anti-
biotics without consulting a physician. Details of the antibiotics used
(name of the medicine, symptom or disease, and duration of use) and
demographic characteristics of the respondents were included. Only an-
tibacterial drugs for systemic use were included in the analyses.
Nonprescription antibiotic use, storage of antibiotics, and intended
use. Nonprescription use is defined as the actual consumption of antibi-
otics that were not prescribed to that individual at that time, and intended
use is defined as an intention or willingness to take antibiotics that had not
been prescribed. Respondents were classified as nonprescription antibi-
otic users if they reported having taken any antibiotics in the previous 12
months without a prescription and as prescribed antibiotic users if anti-
biotics had been prescribed. Two estimates were used to assess storage of
drugs: a maximum estimate, including all respondents who stored antibi-
otics, and a conservative estimate, which excluded those respondents who
reported having taken an antibiotic for a prescribed course in the previous
12 months and reported having the same drug at home. We used this
estimate to exclude any current users of prescribed antibiotics. Intended
use was defined as an answer of “yes” or “maybe” to the question, “In
general, would you use antibiotics for yourself without contacting a doc-
tor/nurse/hospital?”
Statistical analyses. Descriptive statistics were used to estimate the
prevalence rates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for nonprescription
use, prescribed use in the previous 12 months, storage, and intended use.
Data were checked for normality. The effects of individual characteristics
were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression analysis with intended
use as a dependent variable and including factors that had a P value of
�0.20 in univariate analyses. Factors were regarded as being significant in
multivariate analyses when they had a P value of �0.05. Nonsignificant
factors from the multivariate analyses were deleted from the model step-
wise. Possible interactions between factors found to be significant in the
multivariate analyses were tested.
Multivariate logistic regression was also used to study the relationship
between intended use, storage, and actual nonprescription use in the pre-
vious 12 months. Data were analyzed by using SPSS (version 23) for Win-
dows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
RESULTS
A total of 400 respondents (response rate, 94%) completed the
questionnaires. Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of
the sample. Our sample was comparable to Harris County census
data relating to insurance coverage, employment status, race/
ethnicity, and education. However, our sample included a higher
percentage of women (68% versus 51%) and a higher percentage
of respondents with a total annual household income of �$20,000
(38% versus 23%). Twenty-three percent of the respondents were
uninsured but received county benefits allowing access to public
clinics at either very low or no cost, and 19% had Medicaid insur-
ance.
Prevalence of prescription and nonprescription use of sys-
temic antibiotics. Of the 400 respondents, 20 (5%) reported non-
prescription antibiotic use in the last 12 months (Table 2). In total,
there were 22 nonprescription courses. The prevalence rates of
nonprescription use were not significantly different across race/
ethnicity groups. The rates also were not significantly different
between the respondents who completed the questionnaire in
English and those who completed it in Spanish.
The rates of prescribed use were also similar across different
race/ethnicity groups, with overlapping 95% CIs. In total, 25.4%
(102/400) of the respondents were willing to use antibiotics with-
out contacting a doctor/nurse/hospital (intended use), and 14.2%
reported that they have antibiotics at home (Table 2). No differ-
ence was observed for intended use and storage of antibiotics
across race/ethnicity groups.
Types and sources of antibiotics for nonprescription use and
reported symptoms. Amoxicillin was used in 10 of 22 nonpre-
scription courses, followed by azithromycin (3/22), ciprofloxacin
(3/22), ampicillin (2/22), and other antibiotics (including tri-
methoprim-sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, ofloxacin, and amoxi-
cillin clavulanate [1 for each course]).
The major source of antibiotics used without a prescription
was a store or pharmacy in the United States (40%), followed by
antibiotics obtained from another country (24%), antibiotics ob-
tained from a relative or friend (20%), antibiotics left over from
previous prescriptions (12%), and veterinary antibiotics (4%).
Respiratory symptoms (including cough, sore throat, and sinus
infection) were the most common reasons for using nonprescrip-
tion antibiotics, followed by urinary tract infections (UTI), tooth
pain, stomach pain, and infection in general. The median dura-

 tion of nonprescription antibiotic use was 7 days (range, 2 to 45
days).
Intended use and storage of antibiotics. For intended use,
toothache and sore throat were the most common symptoms,
followed by ear infection/ear pain, UTI, and respiratory symp-
toms (Fig. 1). For storage of antibiotics (using the conservative
estimate of storage to exclude users currently prescribed antibiot-
ics), amoxicillin was the most commonly stored antibiotic, fol-
lowed by ciprofloxacin, penicillin, and macrolides (Fig. 2). The
sources of the drugs were leftover prescription antibiotics (74%),
antibiotics stored after being obtained abroad (21%), and antibi-
otics obtained without a prescription in a store or pharmacy in the
United States (5%).
Relationship between intended use, storage of antibiotics,
and actual nonprescription use. Intended use was a significant
predictor of actual nonprescription use (odds ratio [OR], 3.5; 95%
CI, 1.4 to 8.9). Those who stored antibiotics had a 4.2-times-
higher (95% CI, 1.5 to 11.6) chance of nonprescription use than
those who did not store antibiotics. A significant relationship be-
tween storage of antibiotics and intended use was also found (OR,
5.3; 95% CI, 2.7 to 10.5).
Effects of individual characteristics on intended use. Table 3
shows the results of the univariate and multivariate analyses. In
the final multivariate model, public clinic patients were more
likely to endorse intended use than were private clinic patients.
Older age decreased the risk of intended use. Higher educational
level was associated with lower intended use (borderline signifi-
cant). No statistical interaction was found between the determi-
nants of nonprescription use in the multivariate analyses.
DISCUSSION
The prevalence rate of nonprescription antibiotic use in the last 12
months was 5%. Intended use had a much higher prevalence
(25.4%) than actual nonprescription use, indicating that the pop-
ulation at risk is much larger than the population of those who
have actually used nonprescription antibiotics in the previous 12
months. The prevalence rate of storage of antibiotics was 14.2%,
indicating that many respondents have antibiotics available at
home. Nonprescription use in the primary care population stud-
ied was not confined to Hispanic or Latino communities only: the
prevalences of nonprescription use, storage, and intended use
were similar across all studied race/ethnicity groups. Previous
studies in the United States focused mainly on Latin American
immigrants (7, 12, 13).
We found that a variety of nonprescription antibiotics were
used from a range of different sources, with a store or pharmacy in
the United States being the major source. Most reasons given for
actual and intended use included self-limiting symptoms such as
sore throat, toothache, or cough. The major source for antibiotic
storage was leftover antibiotics from previous prescriptions, sug-
gesting noncompliance with the recommended duration of ther-
apy. Five percent of stored antibiotics included tetracyclines,
which can become highly nephrotoxic when degraded (14). Pa-
tients from public primary care clinics, those with less education,
and younger patients had a higher risk of intended use in our
survey. The copay to see a physician in public clinics ranges from
none required to over $70, with most patients falling at the lower
end of the income-based sliding-fee scale. Concerns about copay-
ments, in addition to pharmacy costs, could influence patient de-
cisions about nonprescription use (15).
The prevalence rate of nonprescription antibiotic use in our
study is lower than the rates reported in other U.S. studies. In a
survey of Latin American immigrants, 16% transported nonpre-
scribed antibiotics, and 19% had acquired antibiotics in the
United States without a prescription (7). In another survey in-
cluding mostly respondents of low socioeconomic status (median
income of $14,900), 26% had obtained antibiotics from sources
other than a physician’s prescription (8). A survey of a conve-
nience sample of emergency department patients indicated con-

 siderable use of leftover antibiotics, with 17% of patients taking
leftover antibiotics without consulting their physician, most com-
monly for a sore throat (42%) or coughs (11%) (16). Most of
those studies used different research methods, including different
time frames for reporting antibiotic use, study settings, and sam-
pling techniques (7–9, 13, 16). A possible reason for the lower
prevalence of nonprescription use in Hispanic or Latino partici-
pants in our study could be the lower number of foreign-born
Hispanics in Texas, in combination with the higher economic
status of Hispanics in Texas than in many parts of the country
(17). Americans of Hispanic heritage may have different attitudes
and behaviors than more recent immigrants.
A previous 19-country European study used similar research
methods and the same questionnaire but found lower estimates
for nonprescription use in all 8 studied northern and western Eu-
ropean countries (10). The only 3 countries (out of 19) that had a
significantly higher prevalence of nonprescription use than the
one reported in our study were Spain, Romania, and Lithuania.
However, the prevalence of outpatient use of prescribed antibiot-
ics is also higher in the United States than in northern and western
European countries (18, 19).
Our study confirmed that despite being illegal, over-the-coun-
ter dispensation of systemic antibiotics occurs in the United
States. Therefore, enforcement of existing laws regulating the sale
of antibiotics could reduce nonprescription use. Another com-
mon source of nonprescription use and storage of antibiotics in
our study was leftover antibiotics from previous prescriptions. A
European study including 19 countries showed that previous pre-
scription use of antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infections
increased the likelihood of nonprescription use with leftover an-
tibiotics from previous courses (20). Public education should em-
phasize the potential risks of using nonprescription antibiotics
and the inappropriateness of using antibiotic therapy for minor
ailments. Multifaceted campaigns repeated over several years have
the greatest effect (21, 22). Self-medication with antibiotics has
been identified as a new focus for public education campaigns by
the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control
(ECDC), which prepared a toolkit on self-medication with anti-
biotics, offering advice on how campaign organizers could engage
the general public to promote the appropriate and responsible use
of antibiotics (23, 24). Our data illustrate that there is also a need
in the United States to focus on nonprescription antibiotic use in
community antimicrobial stewardship programs.
Our study included a socioeconomically and ethnically diverse
sample of patients from public and private primary care clinics

 and a comprehensive questionnaire that included nonprescrip-
tion use from a range of potential sources. Our survey was the first
in the United States to include intended use and storage of antibi-
otics obtained from a range of potential sources, including previ-
ous prescriptions.
A limitation of our study is that estimates of nonprescription
use may underestimate the true prevalence rate. Respondents
might deny practicing self-medication, especially if they are aware
that this is inappropriate behavior and if they are interviewed in a
health care setting. To discourage underreporting of nonprescrip-
tion use, the questions about antibiotic use were formulated in a
neutral way in which the source of the drug could be chosen from
6 predefined sources or “other source.” We also attached a list of
the most commonly used antibiotics in the United States and
Latin American countries (in English and Spanish) to reduce re-
call problems. Although our sample was comprised of socioeco-
nomically and ethnically diverse respondents, it may not be rep-
resentative of the overall U.S. population.

population of 3,285,000 are using nonprescription antibiotics an-
nually. An integrated approach involving policy makers, prescrib-
ers, and the general public using both educational and regulatory
measures is needed. Such measures should be embedded in a gen-
eral policy to change the culture of antibiotic use by improving
awareness among the general public and professionals about the
risks associated with antibiotic use as well as reducing public mis-
conceptions about the benefit of taking antibiotics for minor ail-
ments.
