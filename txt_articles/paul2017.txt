Retinal-based opsins are light-sensitive
proteins. The pho-
toisomerization reaction of these proteins has been studied
outside cellular environments using ultrashort tailored light
pulses1–5. However, how living cell functions can be modulated
via opsins by modifying fundamental nonlinear optical prop-
erties of light interacting with the retinal chromophore has
remained largely unexplored. We report the use of chirped
ultrashort near-infrared pulses to modulate light-evoked ionic
current from Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in brain tissue, and
consequentlythefiringpatternofneurons,bymanipulatingthe
phase of the spectral components of the light. These results
confirm that quantum coherence of the retinal-based protein
system,eveninalivingneuron,caninfluenceitscurrentoutput,
and open up the possibilities of using designer-tailored pulses
for controlling molecular dynamics of opsins in living tissue to
selectively enhance or suppress neuronal function for adaptive
feedback-loop applications in the future.
Controlling cell functions with light has been achieved in recent
years using natural and synthetic photosensitive proteins6,7, and
retinal-based opsins, such as ChR2, are at the centre of this field.
Usually mutant opsins are genetically engineered to improve cell
activation at a specific wavelength or to make the protein predomi-
nantly absorb a different colour of light; parameters governing non-
linear light properties, such as phase and amplitude of an ultrashort
light pulse, are seldom tweaked to generate a different response
from an opsin. Even though two-photon excitation has been used to
achieve better spatial specificity and deeper penetration in scattering
brain tissue8, for three-dimensional imaging of neuronal activity
with wide-field temporal focusing9, and for optogenetic stimulation
using temporally focused two-photon light pulses10,11, there have
been far fewer studies that have explored the effects of the phase
structure of the stimulation pulse on absorption by retinal. In fact,
no reported study to date has used quantum coherent control to alter
the current output from opsins in neurons.
Light-induced isomerization of the retinal chromophore from
all-trans to 13-cis is the first event in the activation of ChR2 (ref. 12).
(See Schneider et al.13 and references within for a review of ChR2
biophysics.) This photoisomerization is ultrafast, taking place on
the femtosecond (10−15 s) to picosecond (10−12 s) timescale5,14–17.
At these fast timescales, quantum coherence effects in the light–
matter interaction can alter the population distribution of the
quantum states, and hence the outcome of the reaction18. This
can be tested with spectrally and temporally tailored ultrafast light
pulses19 where spectral modulation arranges different components
of the wave packets in the ground and excited state potential
surfaces, while temporal modulation organizes their relative phases,
allowing control of wave packet propagation16. The group velocity
delay (GVD) τ(ω) of a given frequency component of the field is
related to the phase via τ(ω) = δϕ(ω)/δω (ref. 20). When τ(ω)
has no quadratic or higher-order dependence on frequency, the
pulse is transform-limited (TL). These higher-order phase terms
(see Methods) are known as chirps. The phase structure of the
excitation pulse can be modulated using linear chirp (the second-
order phase term) where the frequency is a linear function of time
and the chirp sign determines the temporal ordering of the pulse
frequency components. The ordering of the frequency components
in time causes lengthening of a transform-limited ultrafast pulse.
When the chirp is positive (PCH), the low-frequency components
are in the leading edge of the pulse reaching the sample before the
high-frequency components, whereas for a negative chirp (NCH)
the order is reversed.
For two-photon excitation of ChR2, ultrashort near-infrared
(NIR)
pulses
were
modulated
using
a
pulse-shaper
unit
(Supplementary Fig. 1 and Methods) where the spectral contents
of the pulse were spatially dispersed, modulated independently,
and then recombined to create a complex tailored pulse21 for
experiments. Phase-uncompensated output pulses from a photonic
crystal fibre (PCF) (τ = 250 fs) were compressed to ∼30 fs using
the pulse shaper by aligning the phases of all spectral components
(that is, coefficient of the quadratic term, a2 = 0) to generate
phase-compensated TL NIR pulses. Then, different linear chirps
were introduced in the pulse by systematically varying a2 in the
spectral phase function. As rhodopsin shows a small wavelength-
dependence of cis–trans isomerization photoreaction quantum
yield22,23, for designing pure coherent control experiments, only
the phase was modulated, keeping the overlap between the ChR2
absorption spectrum and the laser spectrum unchanged. For a
channel protein like ChR2 in its cellular environment, interference
caused by thermal motion and random molecular fluctuations along
many degrees of freedom can act to scramble a phase relationship
within an optical pulse. Additionally, whether modulation of phases
could play a role in directing biological functions for such a highly
evolved complex membrane protein remains unclear. Therefore,
we measured light-evoked ionic currents for all experiments as the
output from neurons, which should be proportional to the ChR2
isomerization efficiency at different linear chirp, to emphasize that
the quantum coherence effects in ChR2 were not merely transient,
but actually were able to modulate biological function.
Layer V neurons from 300-µm-thick coronal brain slices
obtained from ChR2-YFP mice were used for patch-clamp
electrophysiology. First, a patch-clamped neuron was stimulated via
one-photon absorption (1PA) of ChR2 with a 470 nm light-emitting
diode (LED) to verify if the cell was responsive to light stimulation
(Supplementary Fig. 2). For cells with substantial peak current, the

Figure 1 | Modulation of current output from ChR2-expressing neurons with tailored ultrashort pulsed light. a, Consecutive traces from a layer V
pyramidal neuron show modulation of the peak amplitude (i, ii, iii) and recovery (iv, v) of ChR2 current due to phase compensation and linear chirp.
b, Phase envelope of spectral components for a2=0 and a2=−4,000. See also Supplementary Fig. 4. c, Population data of neurons show significant
increase in the peak ChR2 current amplitude due to phase compensation. Uncompensated: 30±3 pA. Compensated: 43±4 pA, n=19, p<0.005.
d, A significant decrease in the peak amplitude is observed with the addition of linear chirp of a2=±4,000 fs2; a2=0 fs2: 43±7 pA, a2=±4,000 fs2:
30±4 pA (n=6, p<0.05). Data is plotted as mean ± s.e.m. All currents are negative inward currents.
light source was then switched to the output from the pulse shaper,
which delivered the tailored light pulses for two-photon absorption
(TPA) by ChR2. The response from the neuron to 1,200 ms
NIR stimulation was measured with phase-uncompensated pulses,
compressed TL pulses, and chirped (a2=−4,000 fs2) pulses (Fig. 1).
The peak current evoked with TPA of TL pulses (average power
at focus: 10 kW mm−2; fluence: 5.4–8×1016 photons cm−2 pulse−1)
was about 8% (n = 13 neurons) of the 1PA current (at excitation
power 0.9 mW mm−2). No apparent thermal damage to the neurons
was observed with 1,200 ms NIR laser exposure at this power
(Supplementary Fig. 3).
Five consecutive current traces of the response of a pyramidal
neuron under these three conditions (Fig. 1a) show that pulse
compression (phase compensation) substantially increased the
peak current whereas linear chirp reduced it. The phase of
the light pulse at different spectral components for a2 = 0 fs2
and −4,000 fs2 is shown in Fig. 1b. The population data for
peak current (Fig. 1c) showed that pulse compression to a TL
pulse produced 41% more current output, which is significantly
larger (Uncompensated: −30 ± 3 pA, Compensated: −43 ± 4 pA,
n=19, p < 0.005). Phase compensation also modified steady-state
current and activation rates (Supplementary Fig. 4). Linear chirp
with a2=±4,000 fs2 tested in a subset of these neurons (Fig. 1d)
showed a significant 29% decrease in the peak current amplitude
from −43 ± 7 pA to −30 ± 4 pA (n=6, p < 0.05), which could
subsequently be reversed by its removal.
The probability of TPA of ChR2 per laser pulse depends on
its TPA cross-section (σ2), peak power (Ppeak) of the pulse, and
pulse width (τp) (equation (5)). As we only modulated the temporal
relationship between frequency components by introducing linear
chirp, the spectral overlap between the ChR2 activation spectrum
and the laser pulse spectrum remained largely unaltered. Therefore,
the observed effect is not due to a change in the overlap integral.
During phase compensation, τp was shortened from 250 fs to 30 fs,
which enhanced TPA, and hence, the ensuing current (Fig. 1c).
Similarly, introduction of chirp (a2 = +4,000 or −4,000 fs2)
broadened the pulse (equation (2) in the Methods) and reduced
neuronal current output (Fig. 1d). These effects can be explained
using an effective TPA cross-section argument that is related to Ppeak.
However, the peak current behaves somewhat differently from a
‘normal’ TPA process. A closer look into current output with PCH
and NCH revealed a more intriguing outcome.
In general, a test for coherence, like other properties of waves,
requires demonstration of both constructive and destructive

interference that are expected to change an observable differently2,3.
Therefore, the effects of PCH and NCH pulses on whole-cell
ionic currents were investigated more exhaustively (Fig. 2) to
test this critical point. PCH and NCH pulses with the same
coefficient, a2, have identical peak intensity and temporal pulse
width but vary in the instantaneous frequency. For current
measurement, a2 was varied in the following order (Fig. 2a): a2
(in fs2) = 0, −4,000, +4,000, 0 (recovery). This was repeated
for all a2 values (Fig. 2a–c). In a representative neuron (Fig. 2a)
the peak current at a2 = 0 was −54.5 pA at the start of the trials.
In successive trials with a2=−4,000 fs2 and a2 = +4,000 fs2,
the corresponding peak current values were −14.1 pA and

Figure 3 | Modulation of phase structure altered the spiking pattern of a fast-spiking (FS) interneuron. Spike response of a FS cortical interneuron is
modulated by phase of the spectrally broadened light pulse, seen here in consecutive traces (i–vi). The spectrally shaped light pulse with spectral phase
compensation and linear chirp was superimposed on a fixed step current pulse (130 pA) so that the membrane potential was just below the spike
threshold. Notice that a specific linear chirp value reliably produces a specific spiking pattern (indicated with diferent colours). The dashed line is used to
indicate that conditions (ii) and (iv) show the same pattern. The flat potential region indicates an elevated membrane potential region (threshold
potential), and a region where no action potentials (or spikes) were generated. The pulse duration for each pulse was ≤350×10−15 s
(Supplementary Fig. 7). The laser light was ‘on’ (or consider that the shutter was open) for 1,200 ms, which is denoted by the red bar in this figure.
−41.8 pA (+2,000 fs2); −40.9 pA (−1000 fs2) and −50.2 pA
(+1,000 fs2); −51.2 pA (−300 fs2) and −60.2 pA (+300 fs2). We
observed significantly larger ionic currents with PCH compared
to NCH for a2 (in fs2) = 4,000, 2,000 and 1,000 (Fig. 2b,c). The
trend continued for lower chirp values, but the differences were not
statistically significant (Fig. 2b,c). Phase modulation also altered
steady-state current and the initial activation slope (Supplementary
Fig. 5). Evoked-current outputs with a2 (in fs2) = 0, +4,000
and −4,000 were measured at different average laser power and
indicated that experiments were performed close to saturation
power but not at saturation (Supplementary Fig. 6).
Moreover, pulse intensities measured using second harmonic
generation (SHG) with a fraction of the PCH and NCH excitation
light (see Methods) were almost identical at various a2 values
(Fig. 2d), but the light-evoked ionic currents were significantly lower
for NCH compared to PCH (Fig. 2c). This confirms that there was
nothing systematic in the laser pulse, other than phase, causing the
enhancements in the TPA of all-trans retinal with the PCH pulse.
This is a coherent result as it is achieved through temporal ordering
of the pulse frequency components.
An average of theoretically calculated and experimentally
estimated TPA using equivalent non-chirped pulses is presented in
Supplementary Fig. 7b for comparison with measured current values
at different PCH and NCH pulses (see Methods). Additionally, our
data demonstrated that, irrespective of the sign, the evoked peak
current with linear chirp was always higher than what would be
the theoretical TPA-only current (Supplementary Fig. 7b). This is
indicative of a situation where tailoring of the laser pulse could
enhance the outcome from a biological system, when compared
to an equivalent Gaussian pulse of same duration and number of
photons (see Supplementary Discussion 1).
Next, we tested if the spiking pattern of a neuron could be
modulated using chirped pulses, and investigated fast-spiking (FS)
interneurons. These neurons have a very linear spike frequency
response pattern to increasing current or light intensities, and
are sensitive to small changes in membrane potential. An input
step current pulse was injected through the recording micropipette
synchronously with the spectrally shaped light pulse (Fig. 3).
Consecutive traces of spike output from a FS interneuron show
different spike patterns with a2 (in fs2) = 0, −4,000, and 0
(recovery). A different linear chirp, a2 = −500 fs2, produced a
spiking pattern that was different from both the a2 = 0 fs2 phase-
compensated and the a2 = −4,000 fs2 phase conditions (Fig. 3).
Most published work in optogenetics used short (millisecond)
illumination pulses at a desired frequency to spike-tune a neuron.
In contrast, these data offer the first proof for the concept that

quantum coherent control with tailored femtosecond pulses can
vary the spike output, and therefore the functional state of the
neuron (see Supplementary Discussion 2).
The photoisomerization reaction of retinal has been investigated
theoretically and experimentally5,14,24–30 in the past, including the
possibility of manipulating this reaction by tailored pulses1–5,30, but
these experiments were not performed in living cells. Moreover,
unlike our TPA to achieve an S0 →S1 (π–π∗) electronic transition in
retinal, all these previous studies used 1PA excitation, which cannot
be used to attain spatial specificity and deeper penetration in tissue.
We demonstrated that even though the instantaneous TPA proba-
bility (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 7) and excitation pulse width
are identical for both PCH and NCH, the isomerization of all-trans
retinal in the ChR2 protein environment is favoured with PCH due
to the phase ordering of its spectral bandwidth. Furthermore, the
ensuing state preparations modulated the total number of channel
openings and hence, the light-evoked current, making this the first
experimental evidence of quantum coherent control of biological
function of a protein in its natural tissue environment.
We turned to existing theories of coherent control to search
for a mechanism that might explain this observation. The pump–
dump mechanism originally proposed by Tannor and Rice31–33 can
explain how the PCH excitation pulse leads to enhancement of
the S1 population, and thus selectivity in photochemical reactions.
After excitation, the wave packet on S1 moves from higher to
lower optical frequencies, and the dumping is more efficient for
the NCH pulse. However, this mechanism is suitable only for
strong field interactions at very high excitation power3, where a
molecule can potentially cycle many times during the duration
of the excitation pulse33,34. This most likely is not the case here,
as a relatively low excitation energy must be used for live tissue
measurements. Our observations are possibly better explained with
an alternative mechanism of excitation via wave packet motion2,3,34,
which depends on the creation of vibrational coherences. For weak–
moderate field transitions, the chirp does not directly affect the
S0 and S1 populations, but rather the vibrational coherence within
those populations on the electronic potential energy surfaces. The
final state preparation is controlled, and a PCH pulse with its comb
of subpulses34 favours formation of this resonant coherent condition
during the lifetime of the femtosecond pulse by controlling the
wave packet propagation, thus indirectly affecting the outcome of
all-trans to 13-cis photoisomerization.
No study exists for the direct estimation of the degree of
decoherence for ChR2 in a live tissue environment. Spectroscopic
studies from other groups have demonstrated that in the
photoexcitation of rhodopsin, an opsin system responsible for
vision, the transition from the reactant photoexcited state to the
ground state photoproduct is very fast (50 fs)5,30 and vibrationally
coherent. Even though this level of quantum coherent control
is somewhat unexpected in complex membrane protein systems
such as opsins in a living tissue environment, the source of the
control very likely is the initial state preparation, which was directly
controlled by the chirped light. Then, the field on-condition due
to the 1,200 ms laser exposure was what created the control of the
final state and the isomerization quantum yield35,36. The subsequent
coherence was inconsequential due to the fact that more transfer
to the ground state, or mixing with other vibronic levels with lower
transmission probability through the conical intersection, will also
produce a similar effect, independent of the decoherence timescales.
We demonstrated that it is possible to achieve quantum coherent
control of ChR2, signifying that wave properties of matter can be
detected for a channel protein in a live brain tissue environment. We
chose an opsin for our experiment as it allowed for a straightforward
measurement of functional output after photostimulation. How-
ever, it is noteworthy that quantum coherence control of protein
function can arguably be extended to other light-sensitive proteins.
The degree of modulation for such a protein will depend on the
timescales of photoisomerization (or other initiation reactions),
thermal motion, and vibrational relaxation, but in essence, these ex-
periments are the first demonstration of a more generalized physical
phenomenon and, in principle, it should be possible to attain similar
effects with other photosensitive proteins in living cells. Another
significance of this work is that we achieved this coherent control
of a channel protein using TPA, which can eventually be translated
into living animals with a high degree of spatial selectivity in three
dimensions. Additionally, we also report that the photo-activated
cell function is controlled by pulse shaping, and this might be used
to establish a new direction for optogenetics studies. Optogenetics
has changed the way neuronal function is modulated in cells. The
field has emerged from the neuroscience community, and focused
mainly on developing engineered synthetic opsins for faster and
more efficient stimulation of cells. Instead, it would be interest-
ing to achieve the same goal by changing the light pulse shaping
parameters. The key is that we have developed a novel control
mechanism that can now be encoded into the complex time struc-
ture of ultrafast pulses to probe and modulate neuronal networks
and, in particular, the overall interactions that enable the system to
behave efficiently.
In other pulse-shaping applications outside of neuroscience,
an adaptive feedback approach has been used in which feedback
error signals between a measured and a desired output are fed
to a learning or optimization algorithm to iteratively reduce the
error37–39. Such adaptive feedback control for the pulse-shaped
light stimulus has been successfully used in laser-based coherently
controlled chemistry37,40, and has been increasingly popular in other
applications39. An application for pulse shaping may be in closed-
loop optical control, where the current output spike pattern is
compared to the desired spike pattern and a recursive algorithm
(for example, genetic algorithm) is used to generate the feedback
error signal to compute chirp values to produce output spike
patterns closer to the desired output. Future investigations in our
laboratory will explore the use of pulse shaping in this direction.

Methods
Optics. The schematic for the optical set-up is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1a.
A 470 nm LED (M470F1, Thorlabs) was used for 1PA excitation of ChR2
(Supplementary Fig. 2b,d). After obtaining robust spiking and substantial peak
current responses, the light source was switched to the output from the
pulse-shaper set-up (Supplementary Fig. 1a), which delivered the tailored light
pulses for two-photon absorption (TPA) by ChR2. To obtain instantaneous
TPA and an ionic current response, the laser beam was not scanned for these
experiments. The beam paths of the 470 nm light and shaped light were spatially
overlapped under the microscope objective, and a flip mirror was used to switch
between the two beams (Supplementary Fig. 1). A mode-locked ytterbium laser
source (High-Q) was used to generate ultrashort NIR pulses (Supplementary
Fig. 1c) which were subsequently coupled into a nonlinear supercontinuum
generating PCF (NKT Photonics, cat. # NL-1050-NEG-1) to spectrally broaden the
pulses for shaping over 960–1,060 nm, λc =1,010 nm. The output of the PCF
(Supplementary Fig. 1d) was coupled to the pulse-shaper unit (femtoJock,
BioPhotonics Solutions). The pulse-shaper unit consisted of a diffraction grating
that was used to spectrally and spatially separate the wavelengths. A curved mirror
was employed to focus the beam onto a pixelated spatial light modulator (SLM) to
modulate individual wavelengths. The SLM consisted of an array of liquid crystals
to which an electric field may be applied to advance or retard the phase of
individual spectral components within the pulses. The number of pixels in the SLM
(128) was roughly equal to the spectral bandwidth of each pulse (100 nm). An
electric field was generated in each pixel, which changed the orientation of the
liquid crystals, and consequently their refractive index. In this way, the phase of the
individual wavelengths was modulated. The second half of the pulse-shaper unit
consisted of a second curved mirror that focused the spectrally shaped phase
envelope onto a diffraction grating, and the recombined wavelength components
constitute the output pulse that was directed to the slice tissue through
a 60× objective (N.A. = 0.9). The diameter of the spot size was 1.4 µm. For
two-photon excitation, the average laser power was 13–19 mW (fluence:
5.4–8×1016 photons cm−2 pulse−1). The pulse duration for each pulse
was ≤350×10−15 s (Supplementary Fig. 7). The laser light was ‘on’ (or consider
that the shutter was open) for 1,200 ms, which is denoted by the red bar in
the figures.
The phase of the spectrally shaped or ‘tailored’ light is given by a polynomial
function:
ϕ(ω)=ϕ0 +ϕ1(ω−ω0)+(ϕ2/2!)(ω−ω0)2 +···
(1)
where ϕ(ω) is the phase of the spectrally shaped pulse as a function of frequency ω,
and ϕ0, ϕ1, ϕ2, are the increasing higher-order terms in this Taylor series expansion
around the carrier frequency ω0. In the pulse-shaping software control module
(BioPhotonics Solutions), the coefficients of the spectral phase function are given
by a0–a4, and we have used this convention in our results.
The phases of the individual wavelengths of the spectrally broadened pulses out
of the PCF have a specific phase relationship with each other that depends on the
particular path taken by the pulses within the fibre and its properties. Using a
multiphoton intrapulse interference phase scan (MIIPS), a previously determined
‘phase compensation mask’ was generated so that the phase of the spectrally filtered
PCF output at the microscope objective was made uniform (that is, compensated).
This was generated based on the second harmonic generated signal (SHG) of the
PCF output at the focus of the high numerical aperture objective41 (see page
754–755 for details), using a commercial microscope detection unit (Biophotonics
Solutions). The phase compensation mask compensated for the undetermined
phase of the individual wavelengths and aligned all of the wavelengths to the same
phase42. After phase compensation, the input pulse was compressed from ∼250 fs
to ∼30 fs. However, each femtosecond pulse contained the same number of
photons and energy as the original uncompensated pulse. By introducing a linear
chirp into the polynomial function above, the phase envelope of the tailored light
was altered in a controlled and predetermined manner. The linear chirp coefficient
a2 was related to the pulse duration τ through20,43:
τ 2 =τ 2
0 +
� 4(a2)ln2
τ0
�2
(2)
where τ is the pulse duration of the chirped laser pulse and τ0 is the chirp-free
pulse duration (full-width at half-maximum, FWHM) of the TL pulse. Therefore,
introduction of linear chirp again broadened the pulse, but the total energy per
pulse remained unchanged.
SHG measurement. We measured an SHG signal (Fig. 2d) from an SHG crystal
as an established reference method and control to demonstrate that, in the absence
of any biological sample, no differences existed between PCH and NCH effects.
The SHG measurement using an SHG crystal is a process afforded by our
Multiphoton Intrapulse Interference Phase Scan (MIIPS). After the laser beam was
coupled into the microscope and focused by the objective to a diffraction-limited
point inside the crystal, the generated SHG signal at half of the laser wavelength
was collected by a spectrometer. The total intensity of the SHG signal was
recorded as the integrated intensity of the SHG signal across its full spectral width.
We then ran the MIIPS procedure to maximize the SHG signal, and directed
the compensation phase mask obtained by MIIPS on to the SLM. This resulted
in the zero chirp (symmetric point) shown in Fig. 2d. We then varied the chirp
of the laser pulses using the MIIPS (pulse shaping), and recorded the variation
of the SHG intensity as a function of the chirp. The PCH and the NCH of the
same a2 value gave the same SHG intensity, as expected by nonlinear optical
physics. This established a reference based on the SHG measurement that is
a trivial demonstration of coherent control of a two-photon process by showing
that varying the chirp would not break the symmetry of the SHG response for
either PCH or NCH. We then replaced the SHG crystal with a living neuron
embedded in its native tissue environment, and recorded the quantitative
neuron response (that is, evoked current) due to the TPA of ChR2 as a function
of the chirp.
Electrophysiology. All experimental procedures were carried out in
accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines and approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign. ChR2-expressing transgenic mice
(B6.Cg-Tg(Thy1-COP4/EYFP)9Gfng/J from Jackson Lab, postnatal age:
14–45 days) were deeply anaesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (100 mg kg−1)
and xylazine (3 mg kg−1) and decapitated. The brain was quickly removed and
placed into cold, oxygenated slicing medium containing (in mM): 2.5 KCl, 10.0
MgCl2, 0.5 CaCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26.0 NaHCO3, 11.0 glucose, and 234.0 sucrose
gassed with 95% O2–5% CO2 to a final pH of 7.4. In some cases (age > P25), the
anaesthetized animal was transcardially perfused with the oxygenated slicing
medium before decapitation and brain removal. Tissue slices (300 µm thickness)
were cut in the coronal plane, transferred to a holding chamber, and incubated
for ≥1 h before recording. Individual slices were transferred to a submersion-type
recording chamber on a modified microscope stage and continuously superfused
with oxygenated physiological saline at room temperature. The physiological
solution used in the experiments contained (in mM): 126.0 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25
MgCl2, 2.0 CaCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26.0 NaHCO3, and 10.0 glucose. This solution
was gassed with 95% O2/5% CO2 to a final pH of 7.4.
A Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices) was used in current and
voltage clamp mode for the recordings. Intracellular recording micropipettes had
tip resistances of 3–6 M� when filled with an intracellular solution containing
(in mM): 117 K-gluconate, 13 KCl, 1.0 MgCl2, 0.07 CaCl2, 0.1 EGTA, 10.0 HEPES,
2.0 Na2-ATP, and 0.4 Na-GTP. The apparent input resistance was calculated from
the linear slope of the voltage–current relationship near rest, obtained by applying
constant-current pulses ranging from −100 pA to +40 pA (500 ms duration), and
was maintained at ≤20 M� throughout the recording.
In current clamp recordings, an active bridge circuit was continuously adjusted
to balance the drop in potential produced by passing current through the recording
electrode. The apparent input resistance was calculated from the linear slope of the
voltage–current relationship near rest, obtained by applying constant-current
pulses ranging from −100 pA to +40 pA (500 ms duration). In voltage clamp
recordings, currents were measured in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX: 0.5 µM,
Sigma) to avoid spontaneous firing of action potentials. The data acquisition
frequency was set at 10 kHz.
In voltage clamp experiments where current responses to negative and positive
chirp coefficients were obtained from the same neuron (Fig. 2), the order of trials in
5 of 6 cells was a2=0 (control), a2 = negative coefficient, a2 = positive coefficient
and a2=0 (recovery). In 1 of 6 cells, the order was a2=0 (control), a2 = positive
coefficient, a2 = negative coefficient and a2=0 (recovery). There was a minimum
interval of 45 s between the end of one trial and the beginning of the next so that
the ChR2 photocycle from the previous activation was completely extinguished15.
Two-photon absorption (TPA) probability calculation. The probability of TPA is
much smaller than that for single-photon excitation. It is nonlinear and increases
with the square of photon intensity I 2. When working with a pulsed laser source of
pulse width τp and a focusing lens, TPA probability per pulse (na) can be
defined as44:
na ∝
σ2P2
avg
τpf 2
P
� NA2
2�cλ
�2
(3)
where σ2 is the two-photon cross-section of the fluorophore at wavelength λ, Pavg is
the laser beam average power, NA is the numerical aperture of the focusing lens, �
is the reduced Planck’s constant, and c is the speed of light. As peak power of the
pulse, Ppeak is defined as:
Ppeak = Pavg
fpτp

where fp is the repetition rate of the laser source, equation (3) can be modified as:

peakτp
(5)
for an experiment if all other parameters remain unchanged.
For comparative analysis, TPA probabilities per pulse (Supplementary Fig. 7)
for chirped and other pulses were calculated using equations (2)–(5). Additionally,
peak amplitude and FWHM were measured from experimentally generated pulse
intensity profiles at different a2 values. These values were used for a parallel
estimation of TPA. An average of theoretically calculated and experimentally
estimated TPA is plotted in Supplementary Fig. 7b for comparison with measured
current values with different PCH and NCH pulses. (The evoked current is
proportional to TPA). Please note that the authors understand that for a chirped
pulse, TPA probability cannot be calculated accurately using equation (5) due to
the combed structure embedded in the temporal profile of the pulse
(Supplementary Fig. 7a). Actual TPA probability of a chirped pulse will be less than
what we estimated with equation (5), so our conclusions about achieving higher
TPA efficiency with chirping, at constant pulse peak power, still hold true.
Electrophysiology data analyses. Data was analysed using pCLAMP 10/Clampfit
software (Molecular Devices). Voltage clamp data was low-pass-filtered at 150 Hz
for analysis. The baseline data was taken as the average baseline current from 40 ms
of data just before the start of two-photon stimulation and the peak current
response was taken as the most negative current value after stimulation. The
steady-state current was taken as the average of 40 ms data in the flat part of the
response towards the end of the 1,200 ms stimulation. All voltage clamp data
presented are negative inward currents.
The initial activation slope was calculated as pA ms−1 from the initial 3 ms of
current deflection immediately after two-photon activation. To compute this, the
inward current obtained within 3 ms of laser activation was measured, and the
current value thus obtained was then divided by 3 to obtain the initial
activation slope.
Statistics. All data are presented as mean ± s.e.m. Statistical analyses used the
two-sample t-test and, when appropriate, a paired t-test was used (Figs 1 and 2
and Supplementary Figs 3–5 and 7). p-values < 0.05 were considered to be
statistically significant.
