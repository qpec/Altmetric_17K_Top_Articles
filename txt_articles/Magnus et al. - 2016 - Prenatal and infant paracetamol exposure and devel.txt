Abstract
Background: Paracetamol exposure has been positively associated with asthma develop-
ment. The relative importance of prenatal vs infant exposure and confounding by indication
remains elusive. We examined the association of prenatal and infant (first 6 months) para-
cetamol exposure with asthma development while addressing confounding by indication.
Methods: We used information from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study,
including 53169 children for evaluation of current asthma at 3 years, 25394 for current
asthma at 7 years and 45607 for dispensed asthma medications at 7 years in the
Norwegian Prescription Database. We calculated adjusted relative risks (adj. RR) and
95% confidence intervals (CI) using log-binomial regression.
Results: There were independent modest associations between asthma at 3 years with
prenatal paracetamol exposure (adj. RR 1.13; 95% CI: 1.02–1.25) and use of paracetamol
during infancy (adj. RR 1.29; 95% CI: 1.16–1.45). The results were consistent for asthma
at 7 years. The associations with prenatal paracetamol exposure were seen for different
indications (pain, respiratory tract infections/influenza and fever). Maternal pain during
pregnancy was the only indication that showed an association both with and without para-
cetamol use. Maternal paracetamol use outside pregnancy and paternal paracetamol use
were not associated with asthma development. In a secondary analysis, prenatal ibupro-
fen exposure was positively associated with asthma at 3 years but not asthma at 7 years.
Conclusions: This study provides evidence that prenatal and infant paracetamol expos-
ure have independent associations with asthma development. Our findings suggest that
the associations could not be fully explained by confounding by indication.

 Introduction
Asthma is the most common chronic disease during child-
hood.1,2 Prenatal and infant paracetamol exposures are
proposed to be positively associated with asthma.3–5
However, few previous studies were able to evaluate the
relative importance of prenatal vs infant paracetamol ex-
posure.6–8 Paracetamol is the recommended analgesic/anti-
pyretic for pregnant women and infants.9 If the observed
associations reflect true underlying effects, this is a public
health concern. A limited number of previous studies of
prenatal paracetamol exposure and asthma development
considered confounding by indication.7,10,11
An inherent limitation in observational studies is the
possibility of unmeasured confounding. One approach to
examine whether associations in observational studies
might reflect unmeasured characteristics influencing the
propensity for exposure is to use negative controls.12,13
Examples of negative controls include maternal use of
paracetamol outside pregnancy and the father’s use of
paracetamol. If the associations are similar for maternal
paracetamol use outside pregnancy and paternal paraceta-
mol use, it is likely that confounding by genetic or shared
environmental characteristics is present.12,13
The objective of the study was thus to examine the asso-
ciation of prenatal and infant paracetamol exposure with
asthma development while addressing confounding by in-
dication. To further assess whether the previously reported
associations reflected unmeasured confounding, we eval-
uated maternal paracetamol use outside pregnancy and pa-
ternal paracetamol use. Since ibuprofen is used for many
of the same indications as paracetamol, we also evaluated
the association between prenatal ibuprofen exposure and
asthma development.
Methods
Study population
We used data from the Norwegian Mother and Child
Cohort
Study
(MoBa)
conducted
by
the
Norwegian
Institute of Public Health.14,15 MoBa recruited pregnant
women between 1999 and 2008, at approximately 18
weeks of gestation. The participation rate of invited preg-
nant women was 40.6%. Mothers could participate with
more than one pregnancy, resulting in approximately 95
200 mothers and 114500 children. All participants gave
written informed consent. In May 2014, the 114761 chil-
dren participating in MoBa were linked to the Medical
Birth Registry of Norway (henceforth called ‘birth registry’)
and the Norwegian Prescription Database (henceforth called
‘prescription registry’). Children not linked to the birth
registry (n ¼ 499) and children from multiple births (n ¼
3,971) were not eligible for the current study. We used in-
formation from the MoBa questionnaires completed at 18
and 30 gestational weeks and when the child was 6 months,
3 years and 7 years old. The Norwegian Data Inspectorate
and the Regional Ethics Committee for Medical Research of
South/East Norway approved this study.
Exposures
Participating mothers reported the use of medications for
different indications during pregnancy through question-
naires completed at 18 gestational weeks, 30 gestational
weeks and when the child was 6 months old. The mother
was asked if she had experienced the disease/symptom of
interest, and to list the medications she had used for that
specific disease/symptom. The mother also listed the child’s
use of medications during the first 6 months of life.
Medications were coded using the Anatomical Therapeutic
Chemical classification system (ATC). Medications con-
taining paracetamol (N02BE01, N02AA59, N02AX52
and N02BE51) were extracted. Three of the medications
contained
other
active
ingredients,
namely
codeine
(N02AA59),
tramadol
(N02AX52)
and
caffeine
(N02BE51). To distinguish between prenatal vs infant
paracetamol exposure, we classified mutually exclusive ex-
posure categories: no exposure, prenatal exposure only, in-
fant exposure only, both prenatal and infant exposure.
Key Messages
• Prenatal and infant paracetamol exposures were independently associated with asthma development after adjusting
for common indications.
• We compared associations between several conditions during pregnancy, with and without the use of paracetamol,
and asthma development in the offspring. Our findings suggest that the associations could not be fully explained by
confounding by indication.
• Maternal use of paracetamol outside pregnancy and paternal use of paracetamol did not show associations with
asthma development in the offspring, indicating little influence by unmeasured characteristics reflected in the propen-
sity for using paracetamol.

 Outcomes
We examined two asthma outcomes based on the MoBa
questionnaires and one outcome based on dispensed
asthma medications. (i) We defined current asthma at 3
years as a ‘yes’ in response to current asthma in combin-
ation with use of short- or long-acting beta2-agonists
(R03AC) and/or inhaled corticosteroids (R03BA) in the
past year reported in the 3-year questionnaire. (ii) Current
asthma at 7 years was defined according to three positive
criteria reported in the 7-year questionnaire: a positive re-
port of ever asthma, experiencing asthma symptoms during
the past year and using medications for asthma in the past
year. (iii) A separate asthma definition at age 7 was based
on information from the prescription registry. A child was
regarded as having asthma if he/she had a dispensed
asthma medication during the past year in addition to a se-
cond dispensed prescription within 1 year after the first.
Asthma medications included R03AC, R03BA, R03AK
and R03DC.
Other variables
Maternal characteristics included age, parity, education,
pre-pregnancy body mass index (weight in kilograms div-
ided by measured height in metres squared), smoking dur-
ing
pregnancy,
asthma,
respiratory
tract
infections/
influenza during pregnancy, pain during pregnancy, fever
during pregnancy and use of antibiotics during pregnancy.
Child characteristics included the child’s gender, birth-
weight, breastfeeding in the first 6 months, respiratory
tract infections in the first 6 months, body mass index at 6
months and use of antibiotics during the first 6 months.
We classified antibiotics for systemic use based on ATC
codes J01A-J01X.
Statistical analyses
The analysis consisted of several steps. First, we examined
the associations between prenatal and infant paracetamol
exposure with asthma development using log-linear regres-
sion, reporting relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence
intervals (CI). The multivariable analyses adjusted for all
the potential confounding factors as in Table 1. We used
cluster variance estimation to account for siblings in the
analyses. In order to evaluate whether maternal history of
asthma was an effect modifier on the multiplicative scale,
we included product terms in the multivariable regression
models.
Second, we evaluated the likelihood of confounding by
indication by focusing on three common indications for
use
of
paracetamol
in
pregnancy:
pain,
fever
and
respiratory tract infections/influenza. There was little a pri-
ori evidence that maternal pain during pregnancy might be
associated with asthma development in the offspring.
However, we wanted to evaluate whether maternal use of
paracetamol
for
different/partly
unrelated
indications
yielded similar associations with asthma development in
the offspring. We categorized mutually exclusive exposure
categories of mothers who had experienced the different in-
dications with and without the use of paracetamol.
In order to evaluate whether these maternal indications
acted as effect modifiers on the multiplicative scale, we
included product terms in the multivariable regression
models.
Third, we conducted sensitivity analyses to explore un-
measured confounding by background factors influencing
the propensity for paracetamol exposure by examining ma-
ternal use of paracetamol the past 6 months before preg-
nancy, maternal use of paracetamol during the first 6
months after pregnancy and the father’s paracetamol use.
Fourth, since paracetamol and ibuprofen are used for
similar indications, information about maternal use of ibu-
profen during pregnancy was extracted (M01AE01). We
subsequently evaluated prenatal exposure to paracetamol
and ibuprofen in combination (neither, only ibuprofen,
only paracetamol, both ibuprofen and paracetamol), to
evaluate whether maternal use of these two medications
during pregnancy yielded the same association with
asthma development.
There were approximately 10-15% of observations
with missing information in the multivariable analyses. We
therefore conducted multiple imputation by chained equa-
tions, imputing a total of 20 datasets.
All of the P-values presented are two-sided. We
conducted the analyses using Stata version 13 (Statacorp,
TX).
Results
A total of 53169 children were included in the analysis of
current asthma at 3 years, 25394 in the evaluation of cur-
rent asthma at 7 years and 45607 in the evaluation of dis-
pensed asthma medications at 7 years (Figure 1). The
characteristics among individuals with and without the ne-
cessary follow-up information are given in Supplementary
Table 1 (available as Supplementary data at IJE online). A
total of 27.9% of children were only exposed to paraceta-
mol during pregnancy, 15.5% only during infancy and
19.1% were exposed both during pregnancy and infancy.
The distribution of characteristics by prenatal and infant
paracetamol exposure is given in Table 1.
A total 5.7% of children had current asthma at 3 years,
5.1% had current asthma at 7 years and 4.8% had

 dispensed asthma medications at 7 years. There were inde-
pendent associations between asthma at 3 years with pre-
natal paracetamol exposure (adj. RR 1.13; 95% CI: 1.02–
1.25) and use of paracetamol during infancy (adj. RR 1.29;
95% CI: 1.16–1.45) (Table 2). Similar results were
observed for current asthma at 7 years and dispensed
asthma medications at 7 years (Table 2).
There was no strong evidence of multiplicative inter-
action between prenatal and infant paracetamol exposure
on
asthma
development
(P-valuesinteraction
>
0.07).
Separate analyses of prenatal and infant paracetamol ex-
posure
with
asthma
development
are
included
in
Supplementary Table 2 (available as Supplementary data
at IJE online). The results indicated a slightly stronger as-
sociation between children exposed to paracetamol during
two time periods of pregnancy with asthma development
(Supplementary Table 2).
Our findings indicated evidence of an interaction by
maternal history of asthma on the association between
infant
paracetamol exposure and asthma at
3 years
(P-valueinteraction < 0.01) (Supplementary Table 3, available
as Supplementary data at IJE online). However, there was
no strong evidence of an interaction by maternal history of
asthma for the association between prenatal paracetamol
and asthma development, or the association between infant
paracetamol exposure and the asthma outcomes at 7 years
(P-valuesinteraction > 0.1) (Supplementary Table 3).
We evaluated respiratory tract infections/influenza,
fever and pain during pregnancy as common indications
for using paracetamol. Prenatal paracetamol exposure for
these three indications yielded similar associations with
asthma
development
(Table
3).
Furthermore,
pain
showed a positive association with asthma development
without the use of paracetamol (Table 3). The strongest
association was seen if the mother used paracetamol dur-
ing pregnancy for more than one indication, adj. RR 1.94
(95% CI: 1.58–2.37) for current asthma at 3 years (Table
3). In order to further evaluate the potential role of con-
founding by indication, we conducted stratified analyses
of the association between prenatal paracetamol exposure
and asthma development by the three indications in turn
(Supplementary Table 4, available as Supplementary data
at IJE online). The results indicated no strong evidence
of multiplicative interaction (P-valuesinteraction > 0.3).
Likewise, we also conducted a stratified analysis of the as-
sociation
between
infant
paracetamol
exposure
and
asthma development by the child’s experience of respira-
tory tract infections during the first 6 months of life
(Supplementary Table 5, available as Supplementary data
at IJE online). The results indicated no evidence of multi-
plicative interaction (P-valuesinteraction > 0.5).
There was no strong evidence of an association between
paternal paracetamol use and asthma in the offspring

 at IJE online). Likewise, maternal paracetamol use during
the past 6 months before pregnancy, or the first 6 months
after delivery, showed no strong evidence of an association
with asthma in the offspring (Supplementary Table 6).
Prenatal exposure to ibuprofen was only reported
for 5.8% of children. Prenatal exposure to ibuprofen only
(no exposure to paracetamol) showed some evidence of
an association with current asthma at 3 years, adj. RR
1.31 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.72), whereas there was weak
evidence for a positive association with current asthma at
7 years and dispensed asthma medications at 7 years
(Table 4).
The results from the multiple imputation analyses were
similar to the complete case analyses (Supplementary
Table 7, available as Supplementary data at IJE online). A
sensitivity analysis
of
prenatal
paracetamol exposure
excluding mothers who had reported multiple medications
and indicated multiple time periods (during and outside
pregnancy), approximately 9% of mothers, also indicated
similar associations (data not shown).
Discussion
This large-scale prospective observational study indicated
that both prenatal and infant paracetamol exposure
showed independent positive associations with asthma de-
velopment. Furthermore, the association between prenatal
paracetamol exposure and asthma development was simi-
lar if used for respiratory tract infections/influenza, fever
or pain. Prenatal ibuprofen exposure was only associated
with an early asthma phenotype.
Comparison with previous studies

ures are positively associated with asthma development is

 largely in accordance with results summarized in meta-
analyses.3–5 However, most studies in these meta-analyses
did not address confounding by indication.
Of the three previous studies examining prenatal para-
cetamol exposure and asthma development that adjusted
for infections/antibiotics during pregnancy, all reported a
positive association.7,10,11 The magnitude of the associ-
ations in these studies ranged between 1.15 and 1.29.7,10,11
Among previous studies of infant paracetamol exposure and
asthma development that adjusted for the child’s experience
of respiratory tract infections,6,8,16–19 three studies reported
a positive association.6,16,19 These studies reported that
paracetamol exposure during infancy was associated with a
doubling
in
the
risk
of
asthma
development.6,16,19
However, one of these studies indicated that the association
was restricted to girls.6 Our study is the first to evaluate the
relative importance of prenatal vs infant paracetamol ex-
posure and able to account for common indications during
both exposure periods. This allowed us to show that both
prenatal and infant paracetamol exposures had independ-
ent positive associations with asthma development after ad-
justment
for
confounding
by
indication
during both
exposure periods.
Two previous studies examined prenatal ibuprofen
exposure and asthma development.8,11 One of these
studies examined both prenatal and infant ibuprofen ex-
posure, reporting a positive association with infant ibupro-
fen
exposure,
adjusted
odds
ratio
1.20
(95%
confidence interval 1.02-1.40), but no strong evidence of
an association with prenatal ibuprofen exposure, 1.17
(0.78–1.76).8 Our results indicated weak evidence for
a positive association between prenatal ibuprofen expos-
ure with asthma at 3 years and no strong evidence for an
association with asthma at 7 years. We could not evaluate
infant ibuprofen exposure as too few were exposed
(0.1%).
Interpretation of main findings
Pregnant women who have asthma might be more likely to
choose paracetamol as an analgesic/antipyretic compared
with acetylsalicylic acid and other non-steroidal anti-

 This is the first study to address maternal conditions in
pregnancy with and without the use of paracetamol in rela-
tion to asthma in the offspring. Maternal paracetamol use
for respiratory tract infections/influenza, fever or pain
all showed a positive association with asthma in the off-
spring, wheras maternal report of pain was the only indica-
tion that was positively associated with asthma in the
offspring if the mother did not use paracetamol. Pain is
highly subjective and likely influenced by a number of fac-
tors, and these findings therefore need to be replicated
and explored in depth. One might speculate that maternal
pain during pregnancy is a potential source of stress.
A possible explanation for our finding is therefore the asso-
ciation between prenatal exposure to stress and asthma de-
velopment.21–24
However,
our
observed
associations
of
prenatal
and
infant
paracetamol
exposure
with
asthma development might also reflect the severity of
the condition leading to paracetamol use. It was not pos-
sible to
further
evaluate this
using

information
available.

 We cannot exclude the possibility that the association
of prenatal and infant paracetamol exposures with asthma
development might be partly mediated by later paraceta-
mol exposure.
The evaluation of maternal paracetamol use outside
pregnancy and paternal paracetamol use was motivated by
a negative controls approach.12,13 Evaluation of these
negative controls allowed an assessment of the likelihood
of unmeasured confounding by characteristics that might
influence the propensity for using paracetamol. Only one
study has previously evaluated maternal paracetamol use
after pregnancy and paternal paracetamol use.25 In line
with the findings from this previous study, we found no
strong evidence for an association between maternal para-
cetamol use outside pregnancy or paternal paracetamol use
with asthma in the offspring, supporting the conclusion
that the results were not caused by underlying characteris-
tics or health behaviour.
If the observed association between paracetamol expos-
ure and asthma development reflects a true effect, pro-
posed
biological
mechanisms
include
the
ability
of
paracetamol to induce oxidative stress and enhance Th2
cell polarization and mediation of non-eosinophilic inflam-
matory responses.26,27 Increased oxidative stress during
pregnancy and infancy is hypothesized to increase the risk
of asthma.28 This hypothesis is also supported by studies
reporting an inverse association between maternal antioxi-
dant
intake
during
pregnancy
and
asthma
in
the
offspring.29,30 Results from the Avon Longitudinal Study
of Parents and Children also indicate that maternal anti-
oxidant gene polymorphism may modify the association
between
prenatal
paracetamol
exposure
and
asthma
development.7
Ibuprofen is used for many of the same indications as
paracetamol. According to Norwegian guidelines, ibupro-
fen is not recommended for pregnant women or infants
who weigh less than 10 kg.9 Based on our results, we could
not conclude with certainty that prenatal ibuprofen expos-
ure did not have a similar positive association with asthma
development as observed for prenatal paracetamol expos-
ure, since we likely had limited power to detect an associ-
ation with our outcomes at 7 years. Ibuprofen is a COX-1
inhibitor, contributing to an up-regulation of leukotrienes,
thought to play a role in asthma pathogenesis.31
Strengths and limitations
Strengths of the current study include the size, detailed
evaluation of different indications for prenatal paraceta-
mol exposure and evaluation of prenatal ibuprofen expos-
ure, in addition to the evaluation of maternal paracetamol
use outside pregnancy and paternal paracetamol use as
negative controls. This is the first study comparing the as-
sociation between prenatal exposure with different indica-
tions, and use of paracetamol for different indications with
development of asthma. It is also the first study examining

 the relative importance of prenatal vs infant paracetamol
exposure in relation to asthma development, that was able
to adjust for confounding by indication during both expos-
ure periods.
The main limitation of the information available in
MoBa was the ability to account for the amount of para-
cetamol used and severity of the underlying indications.
However, by evaluating prenatal paracetamol exposure for
more than one indication and during more than one time
period of pregnancy, we evaluated two approaches to dis-
tinguish between amounts of exposure. The classification
of prenatal and infant paracetamol exposures through
questionnaires could have resulted in misclassification.
Due to the prospective data collection, any misclassifica-
tion of paracetamol exposure is unlikely to be differential
by the child’s asthma status. Another limitation is that the
information available for the child’s use of medications
during the first 6 months of life did not include which spe-
cific condition the medications had been used for. By using
maternal report of the child’s asthma status, there may
also be misclassification of the outcome. However, mater-
nal report that the child used asthma medications in the
past year on the 7-years questionnaire in MoBa compared
well with dispensed asthma medications in the prescription
registry.32 A comparison of MoBa participants against all
Norwegian women who gave birth during the inclusion
period indicated that several high-risk groups might be
under-represented.15 This might influence the generaliz-
ability of our results.33–35 Our study further required infor-
mation from a number of follow-up questionnaires. A
comparison of eligible individuals with and without the ne-
cessary follow-up information indicated that mothers of
children with the necessary follow-up information were
older, were more likely to have higher education and were
less likely to smoke (Supplementary Table 1). We further
evaluated bias due to loss to follow-up, by using dispensed
asthma medications as an additional outcome which
showed associations similar to those of the questionnaire-
based outcome.
Conclusion
Our study is by far the largest study to provide evidence
that prenatal and infant paracetamol exposures have inde-
pendent positive associations with asthma development.
Our findings suggest that the associations could not be
fully explained by confounding by indication. Paracetamol
is the most commonly used analgesic/antipyretic among
pregnant women and infants, and uncovering potential ad-
verse effects is of public health importance. Based on the
inherent challenges in observational studies, evidence from
a randomized controlled trial would be beneficial.
