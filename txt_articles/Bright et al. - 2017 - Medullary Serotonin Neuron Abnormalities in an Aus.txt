Cohort of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome

Abstract
Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) neurons in the medulla
oblongata project extensively to key autonomic and respiratory nuclei
in the brainstem and spinal cord regulating critical homeostatic func-
tions. Multiple abnormalities in markers of 5-HT function in the me-
dulla in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) have been reported,
informing the hypothesis that at least a subset of SIDS cases is caused
by deficits in 5-HT function resulting in impaired homeostatic
responses to potentially life-threatening events during sleep. To in-
vestigate medullary 5-HT defects in SIDS further, we undertook
qualitative analysis immunohistochemical assessment of 5-HT neu-
ron expression within the medulla of SIDS infants (n41) and non-
SIDS controls (n ¼ 28) in an independent cohort from Forensic
Science South Australia. Compared with controls SIDS cases had sig-
nificantly higher 5-HT neuron numbers and density in addition to sig-
nificantly altered 5-HT neuron morphology. Thus, for the first time,
we replicated and corroborated previous observations of a significant
abnormality in medullary 5-HT neuron expression in SIDS in a sepa-
rate independent SIDS cohort. This study further supports the hypoth-
esis that medullary 5-HT defects contribute to the pathogenesis of a
subset of SIDS victims and provides additional evidence of a more
complex abnormality in 5-HT neuron dysfunction specifically within
the different caudal and rostral medullary 5-HT domains.

INTRODUCTION
Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the sudden un-
expected death of an infant <1 year of age that cannot be
explained after a thorough investigation is conducted, includ-
ing a complete autopsy, examination of the death scene, and a
review of the clinical history (1). SIDS is the leading cause of
death in infants (0–12 months) in Australia and the developed
world. There is substantial evidence for multiple neural mech-
anisms contributing to the fatal event in SIDS; however, the
most compelling and reproducible research to date has focused
on the hypothesis that SIDS is due to a developmental disorder
of medullary serotonergic (5-HT) and related neurotransmitter
systems within respiratory and autonomic brainstem mediated
pathways. It is postulated that these abnormalities develop pre-
natally but are not uncovered until the postnatal period where
there is heightened vulnerability of the infant to harmful stim-
uli such as hypoxia (2–4). 5-HT abnormalities have been
reported across multiple separate and individual SIDS data-
sets from varying ethnic, social and cultural backgrounds
(5–8) and involve raphe, extraraphe, and ventral (arcuate) pop-
ulations of the brainstem containing 5-HT neurons and their
projection sites, such as the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus
and the nucleus of the solitary tract (9). Abnormalities identi-
fied include alterations in 5HT receptor binding patterns
(5HT1A and 5HT2A receptors) (5, 8, 10–12), reduced brain-
stem levels of 5-HT and tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2; the
rate limiting enzyme regulating 5-HT synthesis) (7), decreased
binding to 5HT transporter relative to 5HT cell density (8), in-
creased 5HT cell number and density of 5HT neurons, mor-
phological immaturity of 5HT neurons (8), and reductions in
the level of the 14-3-3 signal transduction family of proteins in
regions of the medulla oblongata critically involved in the reg-
ulation of homeostatic function (13). Given the complex role
of 5-HT within the medulla, associated abnormalities have
been identified as likely responsible for impaired reflexes and
responses of critical autonomic respiratory defense mecha-
nisms to exogenous stressors such as hypoxia (2, 3, 5).
While 5-HT abnormalities are the most reproducible
observations of neurotransmitter abnormalities within the
medullary network in SIDS research to date, replication and
verification of these results in separate independent cohorts of
SIDS cases is crucial for a greater understanding of the mecha-
nisms underlying neurotransmitter abnormalities and to facili-
tate future research into development of potential biomarkers
for infants who may be at increased risk of SIDS. Hence, this
study is the first to attempt to replicate and corroborate in an
independent dataset observations by Paterson and colleagues,
which reported an increased number and density of immature

 5-HT neurons in the medullary 5-HT network in cohort of
SIDS cases from the San Diego USA SIDS database (8).
To date, this finding has not been investigated in SIDS cases
outside of the United States. Therefore, the objective of the
present study was to determine whether these previously
reported abnormalities in the expression and morphology of 5-
HT neurons within the medullary 5-HT network in SIDS exist
in an independent SIDS cohort from South Australia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical Database
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human brainstem
medullae from 69 infant cases dying from either SIDS
(n ¼ 41), or causes other than SIDS (n ¼ 28), were obtained
from Forensic Science South Australia (FSSA). South Austra-
lia Pathology and the University of Adelaide Human ethics
committees granted human tissue research approval. Cases
were dated from 1999 to 2006 with all cases having had autop-
sies performed in South Australia by forensic pathologists at
FSSA. Autopsy information and associated case notes were
reviewed by senior forensic pathologists at FSSA with exper-
tise in SIDS and infant pathology. SIDS cases were classified
according to the San Diego definition (14). The nonSIDS co-
hort had full autopsy case reviews using a digital database,
with causes of death diagnosed at autopsy that were then sub-
classified into categories for the current study: Acute (18) and
asphyxia (9) controls, respectively. Acute cases were defined
as healthy infants who died suddenly and in whom a complete
autopsy established a known cause of death. Acute deaths in
this cohort included infection (n ¼ 8), trauma (n ¼ 4), drown-
ing (n ¼ 3), congenital abnormalities (n ¼ 1), and combination
of illnesses (n ¼ 3). Cases were classified as due to asphyxia
when there was a definite diagnosis based on the history, cir-
cumstances and autopsy findings. All cases in the study cohort
had postmortem intervals (PMIs) <72 hours.
Recognized risk factors for SIDS in each case were di-
vided into 2 categories: (i) “abnormality” risks including fac-
tors that may increase the probability of an infant having an
underlying vulnerability or adverse prenatal exposure; and (ii)
“stressors” including environmental or physical factors that
impinge on the vulnerable infant during the critical period of
postnatal development potentially challenging homeostatic
function (Table 1). These risk factors were determined for
each SIDS and control case by review of the digital autopsy
database. Race or ethnicity of each SIDS infants was also de-
termined to establish whether there are differences in SIDS
rates amongst different populations in the South Australian co-
hort that may influence observations.
Determination of Number, Morphology and
Density of 5-HT Neurons in Caudal, Mid, and
Rostral Medulla
Immunohistochemistry was performed for TPH2, a
marker of 5-HT neurons, on 5-mm-thick formalin-fixed paraf-
fin embedded sections of infant brainstem medulla with the
PH8 antibody (MAB5278 mouse monoclonal, Merck Milli-
pore, Billerica, MA), using previous protocols (8). Positively
stained TPH2 neurons were quantitatively analyzed at stan-
dardized regions of the caudal, mid, and rostral medulla that
had previously been rigorously defined based on the atlas of
Olszewski and Baxter (15) by Kinney and colleagues (16).
The caudal medulla corresponds to Plate XI, mid medulla cor-
responds to Plate XII, and rostral medulla corresponds to Plate
XIV according to the atlas of Olszewski and Baxter (15). One
examiner blinded to the diagnoses of all cases manually
counted and assessed immunopositive neurons marked with
different graphic symbols and labels according to strict guide-
lines using the Neurolucida computer-based method (version
6.02.2, 64 bit; MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT). Neurons were
only recorded as immunolabeled cell bodies if they were in-
tensely stained and morphologically identifiable as immuno-
positive neurons belonging to 1 of 5 morphological cell types
previously defined by Kinney et al including granular, fusi-
form, pyramidal, and multipolar, with immunopositive cells
not able to be morphologically classified labeled as “other”
(Fig. 1) (16). The perimeter of each section was traced to de-
termine the area (mm2) for total cell density measurements.
The distribution of total immunoreactive cells within the entire
section and then specifically within the raphe and extra-raphe
sub-regions were counted, in addition to total number of cells
by morphology within the entire section and regionally spe-
cific. Two sections per medullary level were counted twice by
the same examiner and the mean cell count value used for sta-
tistical analysis. Review of both immunopositive neuron cell
counts and classification of specific brainstem levels were per-
formed by a second examiner, also blinded to cause of death
diagnoses, with expertise in the methodology to ensure accu-
racy and consistency.
Statistical Analysis
Analysis of covariance was used to examine mean dif-
ferences in cell count, area, and density measurements across
medullary regions by diagnosis group with data adjusted for
sex, PMI, and postconceptional age. Pairwise p values for
SIDS versus each of the other cause of death groups (acute
and asphyxia) were also analyzed and the p values unadjusted
for multiple comparisons. In all cases, p < 0.05 was consid-
ered significant. There were no statistical differences between
acute and asphyxia controls, therefore these groups could be
combined for subsequent analysis against the SIDS cohort.
RESULTS
Clinicopathological Data and Risk Factors
Identified in SIDS Cohort
SIDS cohort ages ranged from 1.1 to 51.4 postnatal
weeks, with an average of 17.7 6 9.8 weeks, compared with
combined nonSIDS cases (acute and asphyxia) with an aver-
age age of 25.5 6 19.3 postnatal weeks, ranging from 1 to
62.6 weeks. When combined, nonSIDS control cases trended
towards being older than SIDS cases (p ¼ 0.077). However,
statistical analysis of age by individual diagnoses did not re-
veal a significant difference between SIDS and acute controls
(p ¼ 0.203) or SIDS and asphyxia (p ¼ 0.125). There were no
significant differences in age evident between nonSIDS

 groups (p ¼ 0.742). PMI was <72 hours in all cohorts, mean
PMI for SIDS cohort was 25.05 6 16.18 hours ranging from
6 to 71 hours versus combined nonSIDS cases with mean
29.04 6 11.97 ranging from 7 to 53 hours. There were no sig-
nificant differences in PMI between SIDS and combined
controls (p ¼ 0.244), or when analyzed by individual control
diagnosis and there were no significant PMI differences
between nonSIDS cohorts. Sex was analyzed by level and di-
agnoses. The SIDS cohort was comprised of 25 male and 16
female infants, that is, acute: 12 males, 7 females; asphyxia:
6 males, 3 females. There were no significant differences in
total 5-HT cell counts between male and female SIDS cases at
each level analyzed. There were also no significant differences
in male and female SIDS cases compared with male and
female nonSIDS groups analyzed by medullary level (Table 1).
The 41 SIDS cases were comprised of 25 male (61%)
and 16 female (39%) infants from varying races and ethnicities.
Information regarding race was available for 37 SIDS cases
with 32 Caucasian (86%) and 5 indigenous Australian (14%).
Birth information was available for 28 SIDS cases; 5 were pre-
mature (18%), and 23 recorded as having term birth (82%). All
41 SIDS cases were identified as being exposed to at least 1
risk factor or stressor. Thirty-six cases (88%) were subject to at
least 1 abnormality risk factor; 35 cases (85%) were exposed to
at least 1 stressor at the time of death, and all cases were sub-
ject to at least 1 factor from both categories. Fourteen of the 41
SIDS cases were identified as being subject to a prenatal expo-
sure including the mother smoking (7 cases; 17%), other mem-
bers of the household smoking (2 cases; 5%), mother abusing
alcohol (1 case; 2%), or mother abusing illicit drugs (8 cases;
20%); these included opiates, cannabis, and amphetamines.
There was also 1 case where the mother admitted to regular
petrol sniffing (2%). Eleven SIDS cases were bed sharing with
1 or more adult/s or other children at the time of death (27%).
Fifteen cases were found supine (37%) and 22 (54%) were
found in an adverse sleeping position, that is, 19 prone (46%),
and 3 side (7%). One case was found face up (2%), 12 face
down (30%), 5 to the right (12%), and 4 to the left (10%).
Twenty-four cases (59%) were reported as having experienced
symptoms or illness recently 1 month prior to death. Symptoms
or illness described included cold and respiratory symptoms
(19 cases; 46%), vomiting (6 cases; 15%), and diarrhea (4
cases; 10%). Other symptoms included 1 case with a reported
apneic episode previously after feeding, 1 case with abdominal
pain, and 1 case where the infant was described as having a
croaky voice (Table 1). Comparison of 5-HT neuron count,
density and morphology with age, sex and PMI showed no sig-
nificant differences between SIDS and controls. Similarly, no
associations were observed for other risk factors identified.
5-HT Neuron Number, Density, and
Morphology
All Medullary Regions Combined
Compared with combined controls, SIDS cases showed
a significantly higher combined total number of 5-HT neurons
for all medullary regions (p ¼ 0.008), and a significantly
higher number of neurons within the raphe (p ¼ 0.024), and

 extra raphe nuclei (p ¼ 0.010). A trend toward significance
was observed in total density of 5-HT neurons, with higher
density in SIDS cases (p ¼ 0.086). This trend for higher den-
sity of 5-HT neurons in SIDS was evident in the raphe and ex-
tra raphe sub-regions. Total area combined for all subregions
across all medullary levels was significantly higher in SIDS
(p ¼ 0.029). No significant effect of postconceptional age, sex,
or PMI was observed across analyses for all levels combined
(Table 2).
Caudal Medulla
In the caudal medulla, a trend for the combined total
number of 5-HT neurons for all medullary regions to be
higher in SIDS (p ¼ 0.058) was observed. SIDS cases had a
higher proportion of fusiform neurons (p ¼ 0.057) and sig-
nificantly more pyramidal neurons (p ¼ 0.018). No signifi-
cant differences were observed in the raphe subregion at this
level. In the extra raphe nuclei, however, SIDS cases had a
significantly higher number of 5HT neurons (p ¼ 0.016),
including
neurons
of
granular
(p ¼ 0.033),
fusiform
(p ¼ 0.041), and pyramidal (p ¼ 0.043) morphology. While
there were no significant differences in neuron density at
this level, a trend for higher total density and total density of
5-HT neurons within the extra raphe subregion was observed
in SIDS cases. Although not significant, there was a trend
for higher total medullary area in SIDS cases (p ¼ 0.054;
Fig. 2A; Table 3).

 Midrostral Medulla
At the midrostral level, SIDS cases had a significantly
higher combined total number of 5-HT neurons (p ¼ 0.026)
compared with combined controls. Specifically, the total num-
ber of granular (p ¼ 0.037) and multipolar neurons (p ¼ 0.005)
was significantly higher in SIDS cases. In the raphe subregion,
a trend for a higher total number of 5-HT neurons was ob-
served in SIDS cases (p ¼ 0.074), with a significantly higher
number of multipolar neurons (p ¼ 0.040). In the extra raphe,
subregion SIDS cases again had a significantly higher number
of multipolar neurons (p ¼ 0.003). SIDS cases also had a sig-
nificantly higher total density of 5-HT neurons (p ¼ 0.034),
principally a higher density of granular neurons (p ¼ 0.028).

 In the raphe sub region, SIDS cases had a significantly greater
density of 5-HT neurons (p ¼ 0.019), specifically of granular
morphology (p ¼ 0.028; Fig. 2B; Table 3).
Rostral Medulla
In the rostral medulla, SIDS cases showed a signifi-
cantly higher combined total number of 5-HT neurons
(p ¼ 0.032) specifically granular neurons (p ¼ 0.022) com-
pared with controls. A similar pattern was observed in the ra-
phe nuclei with a significantly higher total number of 5-HT
neurons (p ¼ 0.016), and of neurons of granular morphology
(p ¼ 0.026) observed in SIDS cases compared with controls.
There were no significant differences in the extra raphe at this
medullary level. Although not statistically significant, there
was a trend for higher total density and density of neurons in
the raphe in SIDS compared with controls. A trend for a
greater total area was evident in SIDS cases (p ¼ 0.073;
Fig. 2C; Table 3).
DISCUSSION
Medullary 5-HT neurons exert a major modulatory in-
fluence on nociceptive processing, motoneuron excitability
and respiratory and autonomic control (17). This neuronal net-
work has been previously implicated in respiratory failure and
sudden death in SIDS (8), with reduced levels of tryptophan
hydroxylase and alteration of 5-HT receptors and transporter
(SERT) binding reported (5–7). For the first time, this study
has replicated the principal observations of Paterson et al (8)
in a separate independent SIDS cohort from South Australia.
In the present study, 5-HT neuron abnormalities within the
medulla were observed in SIDS cases despite risk factors asso-
ciated with SIDS pathology including adverse sleep positions,
cosleeping, and prenatal exposures suggesting that an underly-
ing neurochemical or developmental abnormality is present in
these infants causing them to be vulnerable to homeostatic
stressors such as hypoxia and potentially incapable of
adequately responding to these stressors during a sleep period.
Abnormalities included significantly increased total
5-HT neuron number and density, significantly greater propor-
tions and density of 5-HT neurons within the raphe and extra
raphe subnuclei and significant differences in morphological
subtypes of 5-HT neurons within these nuclei in SIDS cases
compared with nonSIDS controls. While the present study
provides further evidence of abnormal development of the
medullary 5-HT system in a subset of SIDS cases, our obser-
vations differ somewhat from the previous study and suggest
that 5-HT neuron abnormalities in SIDS are likely to be more
complex.
The profile of 5-HT neurons varied depending on the
level of medulla analyzed (caudal, mid, rostral). In the caudal
medulla differences between SIDS and controls were princi-

 pally observed in the extra raphe nuclei and included a signifi-
cantly higher number and density of 5-HT neurons of granular,
fusiform, and pyramidal morphology. In contrast, the midros-
tral medulla showed differences across all nuclei sub regions
including a significantly higher number and density of 5-HT
neurons in the raphe nuclei, primarily neurons of granular and
multipolar morphology, and a significantly greater proportion
of multipolar neurons in the extra raphe in SIDS cases. In the
rostral medulla, we again observed a significantly greater
number and trend towards a higher density of 5-HT neurons
within the raphe nuclei, consisting of a significantly greater
proportion and density of granular neurons and a trend for
higher number of multipolar neurons in SIDS cases compared
with controls. However, in the extra raphe nuclei we did not
observed any significant differences between SIDS and con-
trols at the rostral level.
Our observation of a significantly increased proportion
of neurons of simple morphology, that is, granular neurons,
are consistent with Paterson et al (8) and support the concept
of an underlying developmental disorder involving abnormal
regulation of 5-HT neuron count and the potential delay and
failure of differentiation and maturation of immature 5-HT
neurons in SIDS. In contrast, however, we also observed a sig-
nificant increase in the morphological subtypes of fusiform,
pyramidal, and multipolar neurons in SIDS cases. These neu-
rons are considered more complex and mature than simple
granular neurons (16). Kinney et al reported that maturation of
the normal infant brainstem into the postnatal period exhibited
a shift in the ratio of 5-HT neuron subtypes with a significant
decrease in the simple less mature granular neurons and an in-
crease in more mature neurons (16). The authors speculated
that granular neurons likely differentiate further into the more
complex neuron subtypes across early human development to
serve more mature functions in the medullary 5-HT network.
Furthermore, the authors showed that multipolar neurons,
which are regarded as the most complex neuron subtype, were
present early at midgestation as a small subpopulation and did
not increase with infant maturation even as the physiological
system becomes more complex during early life (16). Our
observations of a paradoxical increase in both mature and im-
mature 5-HT neurons in the medullary 5-HT network in SIDS
cases may suggest a more complex abnormality in conjunction
with a maturational delay in neuron differentiation, a concept
that requires further investigation.
The variability in the 5-HT neuron profile across medul-
lary levels and nuclei sub regions observed between SIDS and
controls may reflect the different functional roles of the 5-HT
network in the caudal versus rostral domains, given they are
distinct in their anatomical location, developmental origins,
functions and connectivity (3). Indeed, animal studies have
shown that 5-HT neuron subtypes, principally within the ra-
phe, serve different specialized physiological functions and
the genetically defined substructure of these distinct subtypes
may execute these functions despite coexisting within the
same anatomical nuclei (18–20). This would suggest that dif-
ferent subtypes of 5-HT neurons are associated with different
disease vulnerabilities. Therefore, abnormalities in 5-HT num-
ber, density and morphology observed in the present study
may be indicative of the specific dysfunction of the 5-HT net-
work associated with the pathogenesis of a subset of SIDS vic-
tims. This concept is supported in part by the observation that
5-HT neuron migration was not altered in SIDS given that the
anatomical positioning of 5-HT neurons within component nu-
clei of the medullary 5-HT system was consistent across SIDS
and controls, which was also reported by Paterson and col-
leagues, but rather the number and density of specific morpho-
logical subtypes of 5-HT neurons within the subnuclei at the
different medullary levels were significantly altered in SIDS
cases.
To address the implications of increased 5-HT neurons
in the medulla in SIDS cases, together with abnormalities in
other markers of 5-HT function, Paterson et al proposed 3 pri-
mary scenarios: (i) increased 5-HT neurons coupled with
decreased 5-HT1A receptor binding and 5-HTT binding is
suggestive that the synthesis and availability of 5-HT and by
extrapolation neuron firing is altered; (ii) excess extracellular
5-HT resulting from increased 5-HT neurons results in a com-
pensatory decrease in 5-HT1A receptors; or (iii) 5-HT neurons
are overabundant in compensation for dysfunctional (reduced
or deficient) 5-HT synthesis, release or both resulting in defi-
cient extracellular 5-HT (8). While each of these may in part
explain the potential consequences of increased 5-HT neurons,
future studies are required to address what potential down-
stream molecular mechanisms are responsible for the auto-
regulation of 5-HT maturation, number, and morphology
within critical medullary sites and what the consequences of
alterations in this regulation might have on local circuit modu-
lation. In addition, analysis of the genetic profile of 5-HT neu-
ron subtypes to determine their function at specific medullary
sites and assess what morphological subtypes are defective
could contribute to an understanding of the underlying patho-
genesis of SIDS. Finally, investigation of the potential
relationship between SIDS risk factors and abnormal gene ex-
pression within the medullary 5-HT network would be benefi-
cial, given that multiple SIDS studies including the present
study, have identified numerous risks primarily associated with
prenatal exposures, sex, and adverse sleeping environments.
While analysis of risk factors did not reveal any signifi-
cant associations with 5-HT neuron count or density in SIDS
cases, all SIDS cases were identified as being exposed to at
least 1 risk factor or stressor with over half of infants found in
an adverse sleeping position and had experienced symptoms
or illness 1 month prior to death. There were also more male
SIDS deaths compared with females. These risk factors identi-
fied align with the greater SIDS literature, further confirming
these parameters as important aspects of SIDS investigations
critical for fully understanding nonpathological parameters as-
sociated with these deaths.
We acknowledge that differences are to be expected be-
tween study cohorts given the epidemiologic and demographic
profiles are different. Findings from the present studies may
therefore reflect the distinct abnormal profile of the 5-HT sys-
tem in the medulla of Australian SIDS victims. Nevertheless,
both datasets align within the same time period (mid1990s to
mid2000s), utilized the same methods of analysis and stan-
dardized classification of medullary levels and causes of
death. Therefore, this study provides a snapshot of SIDS in
Australia comparable to that of the United States, during a

 time of rigorous public health initiatives regarding safe sleep
practices for infants for risk reduction of sudden death
indicating the importance of continued public health messages
regarding risk reduction practices.
In conclusion, for the first time in a separate indepen-
dent SIDS cohort, this study has replicated and corroborated
the principal previous observations of Paterson et al support-
ing the hypothesis that the medullary 5-HT system develops
abnormally in SIDS cases compared with controls and further
strengthens the hypothesis that medullary 5-HT dysfunction
contributes to the pathogenesis of a subset of SIDS victims.
Moreover, our observations provide evidence for a more com-
plex abnormality in 5-HT neuron dysfunction within the dif-
ferent caudal and rostral medullary 5-HT domains in SIDS
cases that requires further investigation at the molecular and
subcellular levels, in conjunction with investigation of the po-
tential effects of SIDS risk factors on the mechanisms that un-
derpin the medullary 5-HT network during development.
