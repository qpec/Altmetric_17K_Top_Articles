IMPORTANCE Given that hypertension remains a leading risk factor for chronic disease
globally, there are substantial ongoing efforts to define the optimal range of blood pressure
(BP).
OBJECTIVE To identify a common threshold level above which BP rise tends to accelerate in
progression toward hypertension.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This longitudinal, community-based epidemiological
cohort study of adults enrolled in Framingham, Massachusetts, included 1252 participants
(mean [SD] age, 35.3 [2.7] years) from the Framingham Original Cohort, of whom 790
(63.1%) were women. Each participant contributed up to 28 serial examinations of
standardized resting BP measurements between 1948 and 2005.
EXPOSURES Age and systolic BP.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Via a segmented mixed model, we identified significant
change points in the association between advancing age and increasing systolic BP among
individuals categorized by their age of hypertension onset.
RESULTS Individuals maintained a relatively stable resting systolic BP level prior to
hypertension onset. Systolic BP level began to rise at a more rapid rate after reaching a level
of 123.2 mm Hg (95% CI, 122.7-130.1 mm Hg) in people with onset at 40 to 49 years; 122.0
mm Hg (95% CI, 120.3-123.9 mm Hg) in those with onset between 50 and 59 years, 124.9
mm Hg (95% CI, 120.2-127.9 mm Hg) in those with onset between 60 and 69 years, and 120.5
mm Hg (95% CI, 118.0-123.2 mm Hg) in those with onset between 70 and 79 years (P = .29
for between-group heterogeneity).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE We observed that individuals in the community generally
maintained a systolic BP of less than 120 to 125 mm Hg, above which systolic BP increased at
a relatively rapid rate toward overt hypertension. This trend was consistent whether the
hypertension manifested earlier or later in life. Thus, a resting systolic BP that chronically
exceeds the range of approximately 120 to 125 mm Hg may represent an important threshold
of underlying vascular remodeling and signal incipient hypertension irrespective of age.
Further investigations are needed to unravel the sequence of hemodynamic and vascular
changes occurring prior to hypertension onset.

 T
he widespread burden of hypertension and its associ-
ated risk for multisystem end-organ damage has
prompted substantial ongoing efforts to define the op-
timal range of blood pressure (BP). The general understand-
ing of normal BP has evolved greatly since the 1970s, when the
age of a person plus 100 mm Hg was considered acceptable for
systolic BP.1 Nonetheless, incremental elevations in systolic BP
duringthelifecoursearestillcommonlybelievedtobealargely
unavoidable feature of biological aging (Figure 1A).
Challenging this notion are experimental data suggesting
that, while many disease traits are age-related, their onset of
development may be effectively delayed by biological resil-
ience (the preservation of health despite chronic exposure to
stressors) (Figure 1B).2 In this paradigm, the onset of BP el-
evation might occur at an earlier or a later age, at which point
BP starts to rise at a relatively rapid rate. As such, then the tim-
ing and nature of the disease onset, rather than its progres-
sion, would be especially important to understand and target
for intervention. In turn, more frequent clinical assessments
might be warranted to monitor for a rapid progression to hy-
pertension once BP elevation is detected at a certain thresh-
old.
Our objective was therefore to elucidate the natural his-
tory of BP elevation in individuals with varying ages of
hypertension onset. We focused particularly on discovering
distinct change points in BP trajectories, defined as a level
of BP beyond which the rate of BP rise accelerates.
Methods
We studied first-generation participants of the Framingham
Heart Study, who compose 1 of the few existing cohorts with
standardized BP measurements performed at frequent
intervals (approximately every 2 years) during an extended
period (1948 to 2005). In this setting, serial BP measure-
ments collected across up to 28 examination cycles per par-
ticipant allowed for precise estimates of long-term BP tra-
jectories. The characteristics and study protocol of this
original cohort (n = 5209) have been published
previously.3,4 To reduce the potential effects of age, time,
and birth cohort, we excluded individuals from analyses per
the following criteria: participants who were older than 40
years at baseline, who had existing hypertension at base-
line, who attended fewer than 3 examinations before hyper-
tension onset, and/or who had hypertension onset before
age 40 years or at or after age 80 years. The last criteria was
applied because of the low number of individuals in these
categories.
The institutional review board of Boston University Medi-
cal Center approved all protocols. Each participant provided
informed consent.
At each examination, a physician used a mercury sphyg-
momanometer to perform 2 sequential BP measurements
according to a standardized protocol; we calculated the
mean of the 2 measurements as the final BP value.3,4 Hyper-
tension onset was defined as a BP level greater than or equal
to 140/90 mm Hg or use of antihypertensive medication at 2
or more consecutive examinations. This approach was
meant to reduce misclassification and represent a durable
change in BP. Consistent with methods used in prior studies
of disease onset,5-7 we also defined hypertension onset as
the first examination at which hypertension criteria was
met. For each participant meeting hypertension criteria, we
truncated data at the time of hypertension onset. If a person
was treated for hypertension at a given examination, we
imputed systolic BP to be 10 mm Hg greater as an estimate
of the expected BP if antihypertensive therapy were
discontinued.8
We categorized participants based on their age of hyper-
tension onset (40-49 years, 50-59 years, 60-69 years, 70-79
years, or no onset), and compared baseline characteristics
across these categories using 1-way analysis of variance and
χ2 tests. The associations between the predictor variable
(age) and the response variable (systolic BP) were nonlinear,
with associations demonstrating values at which the asso-
ciation of the predictor with the response changes abruptly
(manifesting a change point). Therefore, for each age-based
category of hypertension onset, we used an unadjusted seg-
mented mixed model to fit the longitudinal systolic BP data
collected to estimate change points in the association
between advancing age and progressively increasing sys-
tolic BP leading up to hypertension onset.9,10 This method
extends from simple segmented regression to permit appli-
cation within a mixed-model framework; accordingly, the
method includes random effects to accommodate longitudi-
nal, repeated-measures data. The segmented mixed regres-
sion provides estimates and confidence intervals for the
slopes before and after hypertension onset and the change
point identified by age. To estimate confidence limits for the
corresponding systolic BP for each change point, we
performed 1000 bootstraps for each category and reported
percentile limits to accommodate for non-parametric data
distributions. We used the Cochran Q test to assess
between-group heterogeneity in the estimates. We also plot-
ted the systolic BP trajectories using restricted cubic splines.
AllstatisticalanalyseswereperformedusingRversion3.3.1
(R Foundation for Statistical Computing). We considered a
2-sided P value of less than .05 statistically significant.
Key Points
Question Is there a common threshold level above which blood
pressure rise tends to accelerate in progression toward
hypertension?
Findings This community-based longitudinal cohort study found
that, prior to hypertension onset, individuals generally maintained
a resting systolic blood pressure of less than 120 to 125 mm Hg.
Above this level, resting systolic blood pressure increased at a
more rapid rate over time, a consistent trend whether
hypertension manifested earlier or later in life.
Meaning A resting systolic blood pressure that chronically
exceeds approximately 120 to 125 mm Hg tends to signal incipient
hypertension, irrespective of age.

 Results
Applying the study inclusion criteria to the 5209 individuals
in the Framingham Original Cohort resulted in the exclusion
of 3325 individuals who were older than 40 years at baseline,
471 with hypertension at baseline, 91 with fewer than 3 ex-
aminations attended before hypertension onset, and 70 who
experienced hypertension onset either before age 40 years or
at or after age 80 years. The final sample of 1252 individuals
contributed 16 072 BP measurements collected once every 2
years.
The mean (SD) age of the total sample at baseline was 35.3
(2.7) years; 790 participants (63.1%) were women. Characteris-

P = .01; Table). Segmented regression lines fitting the data are
shown in Figure 2.
Discussion
Life-course BP trajectories in the general population are
heterogeneous,11 with some individuals developing hyperten-
sion earlier or later in life or never at all.7,12 Nonetheless, we
observed that among persons who develop hypertension dur-
ing adulthood, systolic BP trajectories leading up to the onset
of hypertension appear similar in pattern but variable in tim-
ing. In particular, systolic BP levels are generally stable until
they approach approximately 120 to 125 mm Hg, after which
systolic BP rises at a relatively rapid rate toward overt hyper-
tension. This transitional systolic BP range was consistent
whether hypertension developed in middle age or older age
and could represent a critical threshold of extant vascular
remodeling.13 Interestingly, this systolic BP range is concor-
dant with recently published guidelines advocating use of the
130 mm Hg value for defining presence of hypertension.14
Limitations
Notwithstanding strengths of the current study, including
the availability of frequent standardized BP measurements
performed in the same individuals serially throughout
decades, certain limitations merit consideration. The mixed
segmented model may not perform optimally for extremely
noisy data or when the covariate effect is markedly linear or
nonlinear, and the model cannot be approximated by a
piecewise association.10 As with any statistical modeling,
this approach may also lead to some oversimplification of
data interpretation. Although the segmented regression
lines fit our BP data reasonably well, BP trajectories through-
out the entire life course are often highly variable, particu-
larly at the individual level. Further studies are needed to
validate and assess the generalizability of our findings, ide-
ally in larger cohorts with serial BP measures performed
beginning early in life.
Conclusions
Overall, our findings outline a possible framework for under-
standing life-course trends in arterial aging, which may have
implications for managing BP in practice (Figure 1). In particu-
lar, our results suggest that the onset of clinically important
BP elevation may be delayed despite aging. However, further
investigations are still needed to unravel the sequence of he-
modynamic and vascular changes occurring before hyperten-
sion onset. In addition, investigation is needed to determine
the potential benefit of interventions aimed at preventing the
onset of systolic BP rise, even within the normal systolic BP
range, as part of efforts to reduce the overall burden of hyper-
tension.

Longitudinal analyses, including a piecewise segmented linear model (solid
lines), identified systolic blood pressure change points (labeled) for participants
across categories of hypertension onset age. Also shown are restricted cubic
splines (dashed lines), with 95% confidence intervals derived from associating
age with systolic blood pressure, without modeling to identify change points; all
splines and regression lines are truncated at the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of
the age distribution for each hypertension age of onset category.
