Abstract
Background—Little is known about marijuana advertising exposure among users in the U.S. We 
examined the prevalence of advertising exposure among young adult marijuana users through 
traditional and new media, and identified characteristics associated with seeking advertisements.
Methods—We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 18–34 year-old past-month marijuana users 
in the U.S. using a pre-existing online panel (N=742). The survey queried about passively viewing 
and actively seeking marijuana advertisements in the past month, sources of advertisements, and 
marijuana use characteristics.
Results—Over half of participants were exposed to marijuana advertising in the past month 
(28% passively observed advertisements, 26% actively sought advertisements). Common sources 
for observing advertisements were digital media (i.e., social media, online, text/emails; 77%). 
Similarly, those actively seeking advertisements often used Internet search engines (65%) and 
social media (53%). Seeking advertisements was more common among those who used medically

 (41% medical only, 36% medical and recreational) than recreational users (18%), who used 
concentrates or edibles (44% and 43%) compared to those who did not (20% and 19%), and who 
used multiple times per day (33%) compared to those who did not (19%) (all p<0.01).
Conclusions—Exposure to marijuana advertising among users is common, especially via digital 
media, and is associated with medical use, heavier use, and use of novel products with higher THC 
concentrations (i.e., concentrates) or longer intoxication duration (i.e., edibles). As the U.S. 
marijuana policy landscape changes, it will be important to examine potential causal associations 
between advertising exposure and continuation or frequency/quantity of use.

1. Introduction
In recent years, the legalization of medical and/or recreational marijuana has rapidly spread 
across the U.S. Currently, over half of states in the U.S. allow the use of marijuana for 
medical purposes, and eight of these states have also legalized the recreational use of 
marijuana (Marijuana Policy Project, n.d.). More states are expected to follow suit given that 
the percentage of Americans who favor marijuana legalization is the highest it has ever been 
(Stebbins and Comen, 2016; Pew Research Center, 2014; Jones, 2015). As a result, the 
marijuana industry has become one of the fastest growing industries in the U.S., with the 
legal marijuana market projected to be over $7 billion in 2016 (ArcView Market Research, 
2015; Sola, 2016).
As the legal marijuana industry continues to grow, so will the commercial advertising of 
these products. While some state regulatory agencies have implemented restrictions on 
marijuana advertising, these regulations vary across states. For instance, some states prohibit 
advertising via specific media; for example, Delaware and Oregon prohibit advertisements in 
specific print or broadcast media. External signage and/or outdoor advertisements are also 
restricted in some states (Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, 
Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Washington). False or misleading advertisements are 
banned in certain states (Colorado, Connecticut, New York, and Washington). Specific 
regulations to limit minors’ exposure to advertisements are also addressed in some state 
policies. For example, Illinois and Washington ban billboards within 1,000 feet of schools/
playgrounds, several states ban the use of imagery portraying people under the legal age of 
consumption (Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, Washington), Colorado and 
Washington ban the use of cartoon characters, and Colorado bans advertising on print, radio, 
and television when more than 30% of the audience is under the legal age. Online marijuana 
advertisements are also regulated by some states. Colorado bans online ads when more than 
30% of the audience is expected to be under 21 years old and prohibits pop-up ads. Montana 
prohibits advertising in any medium and specifically states that this includes electronic 
media. Notably, several states still have no advertising regulations of any type in place (e.g., 
Arizona, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Vermont) (Leafly, n.d.).

 While it is well known that advertisements influence youth and young adults’ attitudes 
about, initiation of, and continued or increased use of alcohol and tobacco use (Anderson et 
al., 2009; Choi et al., 2002; Davis et al., 2008; Evans et al., 1995; Gilpin et al., 2007; Gordon 
et al., 2010; Lovato et al., 2003; Smith and Foxcroft, 2009), few studies have examined 
exposure to marijuana advertising and/or the content of such advertisements. A study in 
Southern California reported that up to 30% of middle school age participants had seen a 
medical marijuana advertisement in the past 3 months (either in billboards, magazines, or 
via other sources), and there was a reciprocal cross-lagged association between this exposure 
and marijuana use or intentions to use in the future (D’Amico et al., 2015). Because online 
advertising is an increasingly important medium for advertising in the U.S. and can be used 
by the marijuana industry to advertise dispensaries and products (eMarketer, 2016a), we 
recently studied marijuana advertising practices on Weedmaps, an online directory of 
marijuana dispensaries (Bierut et al., 2016). Our findings indicated that many dispensaries 
advertised health claims of the benefits of using marijuana, some of which have not yet been 
scientifically substantiated. Of particular note in relation to youth, many dispensaries lacked 
website restrictions to verify a person’s age before entering the dispensary’s own website.
Similar to tobacco and alcohol advertisements, commercial advertisements for marijuana 
have the potential to influence marijuana perceptions and use. Furthermore, restrictions on 
marijuana advertising across states are inconsistent and sometimes nonexistent. Due to the 
dearth of studies examining marijuana advertising in the U.S., we have taken the first steps 
to explore the prevalence of exposure to marijuana advertisements among marijuana users 
across the country. Using an existing online panel of respondents, we surveyed young adult 
marijuana users across the U.S. about their exposures to marijuana advertisements. We 
aimed to determine the prevalence of marijuana users who recently viewed and sought 
marijuana advertisements and to determine the sources of these advertisements, including 
traditional media sources such as print media, radio, and television as well as new digital 
media sources, including online and social media platforms. We also identified demographic 
and marijuana use characteristics associated with viewing and seeking marijuana 
advertisements.
2. Material and Methods
2.1 Participants
Between June and September of 2015, we conducted an online survey with members of 
SurveyMonkey® Audience, a proprietary panel of participants drawn from the over 30 
million people who take SurveyMonkey surveys. To recruit for this voluntary online panel, 
SurveyMonkey asks people who complete SurveyMonkey surveys whether they would like 
to be a member of the online panel. In exchange for being on the panel and taking surveys, 
the participant receives donations to charities or sweepstakes entries. When registering for 
the Audience panel, SurveyMonkey collects and stores detailed background information for 
each Audience member. SurveyMonkey limits the number of surveys each panel member 
can take per week and uses non-cash incentives to help maintain panelists who would 
provide high quality responses. Recent reliability tests of the U.S. SurveyMonkey Audience, 
which involved surveying panelists with the same survey for one week in each of three

 consecutive months, found that 85% of questions regarding personal or demographic 
characteristics, credit/debit card ownership/use, and internet use did not significantly differ 
across the three survey administrations (Wronski and Liu, 2016). Furthermore, 
benchmarking surveys are run regularly so that SurveyMonkey can ensure that the 
demographic characteristics of their Audience members are similar to the U.S. population; 
however, the sample is not nationally representative so we used weighting techniques 
described below.
The target sample size for our survey was approximately 3,000 SurveyMonkey Audience 
members who were marijuana users (i.e., had reported use in the past 6 months), lived in the 
U.S., and were young adults between the ages of 18 and 35 years (this roughly parallels 
young adults as defined by the U.S. Census Buruea: 18 to 34 years). Because marijuana use 
history is not included in an Audience member’s profile, SurveyMonkey could only target 
the age and residency eligibility requirements; thus, SurveyMonkey invited 18–35 year olds 
residing in the U.S. to take our survey. Eligibility items in the survey were then used to allow 
those who had used marijuana in the past 6 months and were among our age group of 
interest to take the survey. Two methods were used to recruit participants for our survey. 
SurveyMonkey sent a total of 101,822 email invitations to Audience members and “routed” 
19,499 potential participants to our survey. “Routing” potential participants involves 
collecting basic demographic information for people who visit the SurveyMonkey website, 
clicking on a button indicating they would like to take a survey, and then sending that person 
to the applicable survey. Those invited to take the survey were not provided information on 
the topic of the survey until they clicked to enter the survey where they were then informed 
that the survey was about medical and recreational marijuana. To reach our desired sample 
size, a total of 21,156 people responded to the invitations (via email or “router” method); 
3,176 of these met our eligibility criteria and had usable data. Although SurveyMonkey 
Audience recruitment uses techniques to limit low quality respondents, we included trap 
questions to make sure participants were reading questions thoroughly and not rushing (i.e., 
“Select B as your answer choice.”, “What does 2+2 equal?”); a small number of participants 
(69/3245; 2%) were removed because they failed these trap questions. When taking our 
online survey, each participant read and agreed to the informed consent document online 
before beginning the survey. These methods were reviewed and approved by the Washington 
University Institutional Review Board.
Three different survey forms were used in order to collect data on a myriad of marijuana-
related items while also limiting the length of the survey to minimize participant burden. The 
current study centers on exposure to marijuana advertisements which was only queried on 
one of the three survey forms. This form had 1,006 participants, but we restricted our 
analysis to only those who used marijuana in the past month (to hone in on current, past 
month marijuana users) and were 18–34 years old which resulted in a sample size of 742. 
Because SurveyMonkey Audience is not nationally representative, we applied weights to our 
survey data so that marginal totals of our survey matched that of past-month marijuana users 
in the 2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) on age, gender, and race/
ethnicity. The NSDUH is sponsored by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
Administration and is conducted annually to provide national U.S. data on substance use and 
mental health (United States Department of Health and Human Services et al., 2014).

 Thirty-five year olds were excluded from our sample because the age groups used in the 
NSDUH that parallel our age group of interest have a cut-off at 34 years. Weights were 
applied using a raking technique with the SAS rake and trim macro (AbtAssociates, n.d.). 
The weights were then normalized so that the sum of the weights equaled the sample size of 
our survey data.
2.2 Survey measures
Survey measures for domains of interest pertinent to this study are described below.
2.2.1 Exposure to marijuana advertising—To measure overall exposure to marijuana 
advertising, participants were asked three parallel questions about the frequency with which 
they saw/heard marijuana advertising: “During the past 30 days, how many times you have 
you SEEN or HEARD information about ... 1) advertisements/promotions, coupons or 
discounts for a dispensary or for buying marijuana (e.g., bud strains, marijuana concentrates, 
etc.) , 2) advertisements/promotions, coupons or discounts for buying tools or devices to use 
marijuana (e.g., bongs, rigs, vape pens), and 3) marijuana product or dispensary reviews or 
recommendations.” Responses for each item included “not in the past 30 days”, “1–2 times”, 
“3–5 times”, “6–10 times”, or “more than 10 times.” Participants were also asked to identify 
where they saw the above advertisements/promotions or reviews during the last 30 days. The 
responses included specific traditional media sources such as television, radio, print media 
(magazines/newspapers), or in dispensaries. New digital media sources included Twitter, 
Facebook, Instagram, YouTube or other video sharing sites, blogging sites like Tumblr or 
Pinterest, other social network sites, and online but not on social media. Participants were 
also given the option to write in other relevant sources that were not listed.
Next, to identify how often participants specifically sought advertisements/reviews, 
participants were asked “During the past 30 days, how many times have you LOOKED FOR 
or TRIED TO FIND information about ...” The topics provided and responses were identical 
to those of the parallel question described above. Participants were also asked to identify the 
sources where they searched for the above information, which included print media, 
marijuana dispensary, newsletters/membership information from dispensary, and new media 
sources including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube or other video sharing sites, 
blogging sites like Tumblr or Pinterest, other social network sites, Weedmaps (an online 
directory of marijuana dispensaries), internet search engines, and online news sources. 
Participants were also given the option to write in other relevant sources that were not listed.
2.2.2 Marijuana use patterns—Participants were asked whether they used marijuana for 
medical reasons, recreationally, or for both medical and recreational reasons. Participants 
were also queried about their use of marijuana in the past 30 days via three separate 
questions that assessed the number of days the participant used 1) marijuana in its plant or 
bud form (e.g., smoked out of a joint, blunt, bong or bowl), 2) marijuana concentrates/
extracts (concentrated forms of marijuana with high levels of THC that are heated and the 
resulting vapors are inhaled), and 3) marijuana edibles. We queried about different types of 
marijuana due to the differing concentrations of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and differing 
effects. Marijuana concentrates are known to have extremely high THC concentrations

 ranging from 40 to 80%, much higher than traditional high-grade marijuana (about 20% 
THC) (Drug Enforcement Administration [DEA], 2014). Ingesting marijuana in edibles 
typically results in longer duration of intoxication than when smoked (Perez-Reyes et al., 
1973). Finally, participants were asked how many times they use marijuana per day on a 
typical day when they used, as well as how often they are “high” for 6 or more hours.
2.2.3 Demographic characteristics—Age, race, state of residence, education (i.e., 
highest level of school completed), and employment status were collected in our survey. 
Region of the country (four regions as defined by the U.S. Census) and legal status of 
marijuana were determined based on state of residence. Gender was provided for each 
participant by SurveyMonkey, as this data was readily available in each participant’s 
Audience profile.
2.3 Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to describe the demographic and marijuana use 
characteristics of the sample and the prevalence and sources of exposure to advertising for 
marijuana and marijuana-related products. Bivariate associations between exposure to 
marijuana-related advertising with demographic characteristics and marijuana use 
characteristics were assessed using Rao-Scott Chi Square tests. A p-value < 0.05 was 
considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were conducted with SAS for 
Windows version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) using survey procedures to apply the survey 
weights.
3. Results
3.1 Participant demographic and marijuana use characteristics
Table 1 provides the demographic and marijuana use characteristics of our study 
participants. Over 60% of current marijuana users were male and White, and the median age 
was 23 years (range 18–34). About ¾ had at least some college education, nearly ¾ were 
employed, and nearly 1/3 lived in the Western U.S. Over 60% lived in a state where either 
medical or recreational marijuana use was legal.
Over half used marijuana for recreational reasons only, while 28% used for both medical and 
recreational reasons and 15% used for medical reasons only. Over 95% had used plant-based 
marijuana products in the past 30 days, while 29% and 32% used marijuana concentrates 
and edibles, respectively. Over half used marijuana more than once on a typical day when 
they used, and about half were high for 6 or more hours at a time at least once per month.
3.2 Exposure to and sources of marijuana advertisements
The prevalence of seeing or hearing specific types of marijuana advertisements in the past 30 
days is shown in Table 2 (left-most column of n and percents). Overall, 48% of marijuana 
users saw or heard marijuana advertisements in the past 30 days, and this differed 
significantly by the legal status of marijuana in the state in which the person resided. Sixty-
six percent of participants in states where recreational use was legal reported seeing or 
hearing advertisements, compared to 47% in states where medical use was legal and 46% in 
Krauss et al.

 states where use was not legal (Rao-Scott Χ2 (df=2)=8.1, p=0.017). Seeing or hearing 
advertisements for tools or devices for using marijuana was most common (about 40%), but 
28% saw or heard advertisements for dispensaries or marijuana itself and 28% saw or heard 
marijuana reviews/recommendations. The sources of these advertisements are shown in 
Figure 1. Among those who saw or heard advertisements in the past 30 days, the most 
common source of advertisements was social media (67%), with Facebook and Instagram 
being the most common platforms (47% and 27% respectively), followed by print media 
(30%) and online sources other than social media (26%). Common responses to “other” 
sources included public signage or billboards (5%) and text/email messages (1%). Among 
those who saw or heard advertisements, observing advertisements on new digital media 
including social media, online, or text/emails (77%) was more common than observing ads 
via traditional media including print, television, radio, and dispensaries (55%).
The prevalence of seeking marijuana advertisements in the past 30 days is also shown in 
Table 2 (right-most column). Overall, 26% sought marijuana advertisements in the past 30 
days, and this did not differ significantly by legal status of marijuana in the state 
(recreational states 31%, medical states 25%, states where use was not legal 27%; Rao-Scott 
Χ2 (df=2)=0.7, p=0.698). Approximately 16% to 20% saw each type of advertisement (i.e., 
for dispensaries or buying marijuana, for tools/devices to use marijuana, and reviews/
recommendations). Sources for seeking marijuana advertisements in the past 30 days are 
shown in Figure 2. The most used sources for seeking advertisements were Internet search 
engines (65%) and social media sources (53%), the most common of which was Facebook 
(38%) followed by YouTube or other video sharing sites (26%). Another popular source for 
seeking advertisements was Weedmaps (24%), an online directory where users can find 
information including menu items and product specials for nearby dispensaries. A similar 
online directory, Leafly, was written in by participants as an “other” source for seeking 
advertisements (4%).
3.3 Levels of advertising exposure and correlates
When categorizing marijuana users into three categories of exposure to marijuana 
advertisements, 45% of users had no exposure (i.e., had not observed or sought marijuana 
advertisements), 28% had merely observed advertisements but did not actively seek them, 
and 26% had actively sought marijuana advertisements in the past 30 days. Significant 
results from bivariate comparisons between demographic and marijuana use characteristics 
with level of advertising exposure are shown in Table 3. Among demographic 
characteristics, only gender was significantly associated with level of advertising exposure, 
as males were more likely to seek advertisements (31%) than females (19%). Although 
seeing or hearing advertisements was significantly associated with legal status of marijuana 
in the participant’s state of residence (as reported above), when categorizing data into three 
levels of advertising exposure (no exposure, passive exposure, actively seeking) the 
association did not reach statistical significance (Rao-Scott Χ2 (df=2)=7.4, p=0.117).
Several marijuana use characteristics were associated with level of advertising exposure 
(Table 3). Seeking advertisements was more common among those who used marijuana for 
medical reasons (41%) or for both medical and recreational reasons (36%) than those who

 used for recreational reasons only (18%). Those who had used concentrates or edibles in the 
past 30 days were also more likely to seek ads (44% and 43%, respectively) than those who 
had not used concentrates or edibles (20% and 19%, respectively) in the past 30 days. 
Finally, seeking marijuana advertisements was more common among those who used 
marijuana multiple times per day (33%) or were high for 6 or more hours at least once per 
month (36%) compared to users who did not have multiple marijuana sessions in a day 
(19%) or were not high for 6 or more hours (16%).
Of note, those who used marijuana for only medical reasons or for both medical and 
recreational reasons appeared more likely to use concentrates (55% and 37%, respectively) 
than those who used for recreational reasons only (19%) (Rao-Scott Χ2 (df=2)=38.9, 
p<0.001). Similarly, 50% of those who used for only medical reasons used edibles versus 
28% among those who used only recreationally and 29% among those who used for both 
reasons (Rao-Scott Χ2 (df=2)=13.6, p=0.001). Those who used for only medical purposes and 
those who used for both medical and recreational reasons were also more likely to use 
multiple times per day (73% and 77%, respectively) or to have been high for 6 or more hours 
per month (56% and 68%, respectively) than those who only used recreationally (38% and 
42%) (Rao-Scott Χ2 (df=2)=81.0, p<0.001; Rao-Scott Χ2 (df=2)=25.6, p<0.001). Reason for 
medical use was not significantly associated with legal status of marijuana in the state (Rao-
Scott Χ2 (df=4)=1.3, p=0.867). However, using multiple times per day was more common in 
states where marijuana was not legal (61%) compared to recreational (47%) or medical 
states (46%) (Rao-Scott Χ2 (df=2)=16.0, p<0.001).
4. Discussion
This survey was the first of its kind to explore the prevalence and sources of exposure to 
marijuana advertising among current young adult marijuana users in the U.S. In this study, 
marijuana advertisements were relatively commonly observed among marijuana users, with 
nearly half reporting that they had seen or heard such advertisements in the past 30 day, and 
approximately a quarter of users actively seeking such advertisements. As expected, seeing 
or hearing marijuana advertisements was more common in states where recreational use was 
legal than in states where only medical use was legal or use was not legal. Furthermore, our 
study highlighted the prevalence of observing marijuana advertisements online or on social 
media, which was more common than viewing advertisements on traditional media sources 
such as print, radio, and television. Finally, viewing or seeking advertisements was more 
common among medical users, those who used novel products such as edibles and 
concentrates, and heavier users. The implications of each of these findings are discussed 
below.
The fact that many marijuana users viewed or looked for advertisements online or on social 
media is not surprising. In general, digital advertising spending has been the most rapidly 
growing area of media spending in recent years and is expected to surpass that of television 
advertising in 2017 (Bagchi et al., 2015; eMarketer, 2016a). Although a few states address 
restrictions to marijuana marketing via digital sources (e.g., no more than 30% of the online 
audience can be underage), most do not, and there are difficulties in regulating digital 
advertising. Although Facebook, the most popular social media site, prohibits advertising of

 illegal drugs and has even shut down some marijuana dispensary Facebook pages (Breen, 
2016; Duggan, 2015; eMarketer, 2016b; Facebook, 2016), this platform was still the most 
common source of exposure to marijuana advertising on a social media site in our study. It is 
possible that participants did not distinguish commercial marijuana promotions from more 
“organic” marijuana promotions (i.e., references to marijuana from friends etc.). 
Nevertheless, regulation of online advertising for other substances and preventing underage 
access has been found to be challenging. Despite banning tobacco advertising on its 
platform, cigarette brand fan pages were easily found on Facebook (Liang et al., 2015). 
Furthermore, specific brands of e-cigarettes have been found to advertise on websites with 
an audience of up to 35% youth (Richardson et al., 2014), and underage Twitter, Instagram, 
and YouTube users can easily access and interact with alcohol industry content on these 
platforms (Barry, Bates, et al., 2015; Barry, Johnson, et al., 2015).
Although we cannot speak to how many underage youth are exposed to marijuana 
advertising based on our study, the prevalence of young adult users who see such 
advertisements online and on social media sites where youth are known to spend a lot of 
time (Common Sense, 2015) highlights the need for increased monitoring as well as 
research into better methods to regulate online advertising. Restrictions on advertisements 
via traditional media also cannot be ignored, as users in our study were also exposed to 
advertisements via sources like print media, radio, and dispensaries. For these venues, states 
can learn from the research on comprehensive marketing restrictions adopted for the tobacco 
industry which have helped to prevent youth initiation and tobacco consumption (Gilpin et 
al., 2004; Henriksen, 2012; Saffer and Chaloupka, 2000).
Another important finding from our study was that seeking marijuana advertisements was 
more common among medical marijuana users, users of novel products (i.e., marijuana 
concentrates, edibles) that are more potent and/or result in longer intoxication duration 
(DEA, 2014; Perez-Reyes et al., 1973), and those who used multiple times per day or spent 
several hours high per month. Notably, these measures were somewhat confounded as 
medical use was associated with heavier use and use of concentrates or edibles. Prior studies 
have also reported that medical marijuana users tend to use more frequently than non-
medical marijuana users (Boyd et al., 2015; Roy-Byrne et al., 2015; Woodruff and 
Shillington, 2016). Because medical users use more regularly than recreational users and 
would be consistently purchasing products to treat their medical conditions, such users 
might accordingly be seeking information about products and discounts/deals from nearby 
dispensaries. Access to medical dispensaries might also facilitate the transition to use a 
variety of marijuana products, including those with higher THC levels which have been 
associated with cannabis-induced psychosis (Murray et al., 2016; Pierre et al., 2016). 
Nonetheless, while we cannot delineate causal relationships from this cross-sectional study, 
prior longitudinal studies of tobacco and alcohol have shown that exposure to substance use 
advertising promotes the initiation and the continuation of using these substances (Anderson 
et al., 2009; Lovato et al., 2003). In addition, D’Amico et. al’s (2015) longitudinal study of 
middle school students found cross-lagged reciprocal associations between medical 
marijuana advertising exposure and current marijuana use (i.e., initial advertising exposure 
was associated with higher likelihood of marijuana use one year later, and initial marijuana 
use was associated with higher likelihood of advertising exposure one year later). Additional

 longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether exposure to marijuana advertising 
leads to initiation of use among non-users of differing age groups, leads to increased 
frequency or quantity of use among experimental users, or the exploration of higher-potency 
marijuana products among both medical and non-medical users.
Notably, there were few differences in advertising exposure by demographic characteristic of 
the participant. Men were more likely to seek advertisements than women, and, as noted 
earlier, participants living in states where recreational use is legal were more likely to view 
or hear marijuana advertisements. This is likely due to the large number of marijuana 
dispensaries in such states (e.g., October 2016, Oregon had over 420 marijuana dispensaries, 
Colorado had over 500 dispensaries with a license for medical sales and 450 with a license 
for recreational sales, and Washington had nearly 500 dispensaries with a recreational 
license and nearly 400 with a medical license) (Colorado Department of Revenue, 2015; 
Oregon Health Authority, 2016; Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board, 2016). 
However, we did not find significant differences in level of advertising exposure by other 
demographic characteristics (age, race, education, employment status). Although advertising 
of other substances, like alcohol and tobacco, has been known to target racial/ethnic 
minority groups or low socioeconomic groups (Barbeau et al., 2004; Moore et al., 1996), our 
study did not suggest this was the case with marijuana advertising. Related, geospatial 
studies of marijuana dispensaries and socioeconomic indicators in Los Angeles and Denver 
found no association between density of dispensaries and the percentage of Black residents, 
high poverty or concentrated disadvantage (Boggess et al., 2014; Thomas and Freisthler, 
2016). Yet, the Los Angeles study did find that dispensary density was associated with 
greater percentage of Hispanic residents (Thomas and Freisthler, 2016). In any case, 
marijuana advertising research is still in its infancy and the possibility of targeted advertising 
to subgroups should be examined in future studies.
Some limitations should be considered when interpreting the results of our study. Our study 
is based on self-reported survey data, and participants might have been hesitant to respond 
honestly or might not accurately recall the advertisements they observed or the venues on 
which they saw them. While our survey was not administered to a nationally representative 
sample, we did weight participants to match the distribution of marijuana users on basic 
demographic characteristics from a large national survey. Our survey was cross-sectional in 
nature and causal associations cannot be inferred from significant associations. We did not 
include all potential sources of advertisements, which could have limited the reporting of 
some specific locations (e.g., billboards). In our line of questioning, we did not specifically 
define the advertisements as commercial or coming from a marijuana business. Participants 
might have included other noncommercial marijuana promotions and reviews from online 
friends on social media in their response (instead of distinguishing such conversations from 
commercial advertisements), which could lead to an overestimation of exposure to 
advertising. Finally, our survey of marijuana use behaviors targeted young adults, as young 
adults have the greatest prevalence of marijuana use (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics 
and Quality, 2016). While our study is among the largest to examine marijuana advertising 
exposure among young adult marijuana users, we did not include non-users or youth in our 
study; thus we cannot report on the prevalence of exposure to marijuana advertising among

 these groups. Longitudinally assessing such groups would be necessary to determine effects 
of advertising exposure on initiation of marijuana use behaviors.
5.0 Conclusions
This study is the first to quantify the level of exposure to and sources of marijuana 
advertising among current young adult marijuana users. There was a high prevalence of 
exposure to such advertisements, as over half of the participants had been exposed to 
marijuana advertising in some way. Furthermore, advertising on new media sources such as 
online or on social media was more common than traditional media sources like print or 
radio. Those who sought marijuana advertisements were more likely to be medical users, to 
use heavily, and use novel marijuana forms that are more potent or have greater intoxication 
duration. As more states legalize both medical and recreational marijuana consumption, it 
will be important to monitor who is exposed to advertisements, including youth and non-
users, where advertisements are being seen, and the content of such advertisements in order 
to provide recommendations for necessary restrictions. It will also be crucial to examine the 
potential causal associations between exposure to such advertisements and patterns of 
marijuana use.
