OBJECTIVES: To determine the association between fre-
quency of leaving the house and mortality.
DESIGN: Prospective follow-up of an age-homogenous,
representative,
community-dwelling
birth
cohort
(born
1920–21) from the Jerusalem Longitudinal Study (1990–
2015).
SETTING: Home.
PARTICIPANTS: Individuals
aged
70
(n = 593),
78
(n = 973), 85 (n = 1164), and 90 (n = 645), examined in
1990, 1998, 2005, and 2010, respectively.
MEASUREMENTS: Frequency
of
leaving
the
house,
defined as daily (6–7/week), often (2–5/week), and rarely
(≤1/week); geriatric assessment; all-cause mortality (2010–
15). Kaplan-Meier survival charts and proportional hazards
models adjusted for social (sex, marital status, financial sta-
tus, loneliness), functional (sex, self-rated health, fatigue,
depression, physical activity, activity of daily living diffi-
culty), and medical (sex, chronic pain, visual impairment,
hearing
impairment,
diabetes
mellitus,
hypertension,
ischemic heart disease, chronic kidney disease) covariates.
RESULTS: At ages 70, 78, 85, and 90, frequency of going
out daily was 87.0%, 80.6%, 65.6%, and 48.4%; often
was 6.4%, 9.5%, 17.4%, and 11.3%; and rarely was
6.6%, 10.0%, 17.0%, and 40.3% respectively. Decreasing
frequency of going out was associated with negative social,
functional, and medical characteristics. Survival rates were
lowest among those leaving rarely and highest among
those going out daily throughout follow-up. Similarly,
compared with rarely leaving the house, unadjusted mor-
tality hazard ratios (HRs) were lowest among subjects
leaving daily and remained significant after adjustment for
social, functional and medical covariates. Among subjects
leaving often, unadjusted HRs showed a similar effect of
smaller magnitude, with attenuation of significance after
adjustment in certain models. Findings were unchanged
after excluding subjects dying within 6 months of follow-
up.
CONCLUSION: In
community-dwelling
elderly
adults
aged 70 to 90, leaving the house daily was associated with
lower mortality risk, independent of social, functional, or
medical status. J Am Geriatr Soc 2017.

G
etting outside of one’s home provides numerous
opportunities for engagement and may facilitate expo-
sure to multiple domains of experiences, including, for
example, psychosocial, emotional, cognitive, cultural, lei-
sure, therapeutic, recreational, occupational, volunteer,
and physical activity. Nonetheless, older age is frequently
associated with barriers to leaving the house. Being com-
pletely or mostly homebound is a known marker of com-
plex comorbidity, vulnerability, and unmet needs and
characterizes a specific at-risk population, recently esti-
mated to be 5.6% of people aged 65 and older (approxi-
mately 2 million people) in the United States.1
For non-housebound older adults, the degree to which
leaving the house affects health, well-being, and aging tra-
jectories has been poorly investigated. A recent avenue of
research has focused on life-space mobility, and evidence
supports the dynamic interaction between declining physi-
cal performance, fear of falling, depression, loneliness,
self-rated feelings of lack of autonomy, perceived environ-
mental barriers, and lack of life-space mobility.2–7 Further-
more, reduced life-space mobility has been shown to
predict greater mortality at 6 months and 2, 3, and
8 years.8–12
Frequency of leaving ones house is a simple and easily
quantifiable measure that may serve as a real-world surro-
gate for the more complex measurement of life-space
mobility. Frequency of leaving the house was shown to
predict subsequent functional status in frail,13,14 and non-
frail community-dwelling people aged 70 to 78,15 but a

 detailed analysis of frequency of leaving the house at
different points over the aging trajectory has not been
performed.
This study aimed to examine the association between
frequency of leaving the house and subsequent mortality.
To achieve this objective, we examined the frequency of
leaving the house at ages 70, 78, 85, and 90 in a represen-
tative sample of community-dwelling adults. Using data
from an ongoing observational cohort study of aging, we
compared
survival
rates
and
likelihood
of
mortality
according to frequency of leaving the house and examined
the influence on these findings of social, functional, medi-
cal and mobility status.
METHODS
Study Population
The study population was from the Jerusalem Longitudinal
Study (1990–2017), a prospective observational longitudi-
nal study.16,17 The sample frame was the birth cohort born
from June 1, 1920 to May 31, 1921, and resident in Wes-
tern Jerusalem. There were no exclusion criteria. Individu-
als aged 70 to 71 at baseline in 1990–91 were randomly
chosen from the national electoral register. At subsequent
study phases, the sample frame was augmented with addi-
tional randomly chosen subjects aged 77 to 78 (1997–98),
85 to 86 (2005–06), and 90 to 91 (2010–11) from the
same birth cohort. The study sample has been shown to be
representative of the general population of the same age,
as indicated by similar morbidity, mortality, and hospital-
ization rates for study participants, those who declined to
enroll in the study, and individuals from the birth cohort
not approached.18,19 The primary reason for attrition was
death; 41.1% of subjects died during follow-up (1990–
2015). Participants or legal guardians provided informed
consent. Proxy informants, with consent from legal guar-
dians, were used in the case of individuals with dementia
or those who were extremely frail. Subjects received a
summary of the assessment, with recommendations for
their family physician if necessary. The Hadassah-Hebrew
University
Medical
Center
institutional
review
board
approved the study.
Measurements
Study personnel performed home assessments using a
structured interview lasting 1.5 hours. Information was
collected on sex; years of education; marital status; self-
reported
financial
status;
loneliness
(global
subjective
assessment as used in the Longitudinal Gothenburg popu-
lation study of 70-year-olds)20,21; body mass index (BMI)
(calculated kg/m2); self-rated health; fatigue; depression,
using the Brief Symptom Inventory22; Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE) score, with a score of 24 or less
indicating cognitive impairment23; physical activity level
(low, <4 h/wk; active, ≥4 h/wk, vigorous sports at least
twice a week24; two measures of functional status based
upon self-report, the first defined as dependence or inde-
pendence on another person in performing 1 or more of 6
activities of daily living (ADLs) (transferring, dressing,
bathing, using the toilet, eating, continence)25 and the
second defined as ease or difficulty in performing 1 or
more of 6 ADLs26; history of falls in the last year; fear of
falling; use of assistive device (independent walking, assis-
tive walking device, wheelchair bound only) or completely
bed bound; visual impairment (best-eye corrected visual
acuity of ≤20/40 using Snellen chart); hearing impairment
(difficulty hearing a whisper from arm’s length); chronic
pain (joint or musculoskeletal pain >3 months duration)27;
history of major diseases according to the International
Classification
of
Disease,
Ninth
Edition28
including
ischemic heart disease; hypertension (antihypertensive med-
ication, sitting blood pressure >140 mmHg systolic or
>90 mmHg diastolic); diabetes mellitus; cerebrovascular
disease; chronic kidney disease; and neoplasm (excluding
skin cancer).
Frailty was defined according the following criteria,
based upon those proposed by Fried and colleagues29,30:
Shrinking: unintentional weight loss of more than 1 kg in
the last 3 months; Weakness: grip strength in the lowest
20% adjusted for sex; Poor endurance and energy: self-
reported fatigue, identified using the question: “Do you
feel generally tired?” Slowness: slowest 20% of the sample
based upon time taken to get up from a chair without
assistance walk 3 m, turn back, and sit on the same chair
(Up and Go test), adjusted for sex; and Low physical activ-
ity level: less than 4 hours of activity per week. Subjects
with 3 or more of these 5 criteria were considered frail.
According to scope of data collection, it was possible to
determine frailty only at ages 85 and 90.
Frequency of Leaving the House
Subjects were asked how often they usually left the house,
possible answers being daily, nearly daily (6 times/wk),
often (2–5 times/wk), or rarely (≤1 time/wk). Implicit in
the question was the idea of intentionally venturing out-
side of the house. Subjects were grouped as daily (which
included daily and nearly daily), often (2–5 times/wk), and
rarely (≤1 times/wk). A similar definition was recently used
in U.S. community-dwelling elderly adults.1 Completely
bedbound individuals were excluded (n = 1 at age 70,
n = 10 at age 78, n = 22 at age 85, n = 9 at age 90).
Study Outcome
Mortality was determined from 1990 to 2015. All-cause
mortality data from the Ministry of Interior were based
upon obligatory notifications of death. Mortality data
were 100% complete for subjects dying in Israel.
Statistical analyses
We used chi-square tests to describe categorical variables
and t-tests for continuous variables. Logistic regression
analyses of cross-sectional data were used to examine the
relationship between frequency of going out and baseline
factors. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank tests
were used to examine survival data and Cox proportional
hazards models to determine unadjusted and adjusted like-
lihood of mortality during follow-up from age 70 to 78,
78 to 85, 85 to 90, and 90 to 95. Rarely leaving the house
served as the reference group. Adjusted hazard ratios

 (HRs) for subjects leaving daily or often were calculated
after adjustment in social (sex, marital status, financial sta-
tus, loneliness), functional (sex, self-rated health, fatigue,
depression, physical activity level, ADL difficulties), and
medical (sex, chronic pain, visual impairment, hearing
impairment, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, ischemic heart
disease,
chronic
kidney
disease)
models.
A
combined
model was constructed that included significant covariates
from the social, functional, and medical models (sex, self-
rated health, physical activity, visual impairment, diabetes
mellitus, ischemic heart disease, chronic kidney disease).
To
address
possible
reverse
causality,
analyses
were
repeated
omitting
subjects
who
died
during
the
first
6 months of follow-up. Data storage and analysis were
performed using SAS version 9.1e (SAS Institute, Inc.,
Cary, NC). All P-values were 2-tailed, and P < .05 was
considered significant.
RESULTS
There were 593 subjects at age 70, 937 at age 78, 1,164
at age 85 and 645 at age 90. The frequency of going out
daily was 87%, 80.6%, 65.6%, and 48.4%; often was
6.4%, 9.8%, 17.4%, and 11.3%; and rarely was 6.6%,
10%, 17%, and 40.3%, respectively. Baseline characteris-
tics at ages 70, 78, 85, and 90 are shown according to fre-
quency of going out in Supplementary Tables S1 through
S4. A consistent pattern was described throughout the
study period, with subjects who were socially, functionally,
and medically vulnerable leaving the house less frequently.
Thus for example, leaving the house less frequently was
associated with male sex, lower education, financial diffi-
culty, loneliness (but not frequency of living alone), poor
self-rated health, fatigue, poor sleep satisfaction, less physi-
cal activity, functional difficulties and dependence, bladder
and bowel incontinence, history of falling in the last year,
fear of falling, visual and hearing impairment, chronic
pain, common comorbidities, and frailty.
We performed logistic regression analyses of cross-sec-
tional data to further examine the relationship between
frequency of going out and baseline factors. Limited num-
bers of subjects going out infrequently at age 70 precluded
statistical modeling at age 70, so logistic regression analy-
ses were performed on data from subjects aged 78, 85,
and 90. For analysis in the regression model, we dichoto-
mized frequency of going out to daily versus less than
daily. The model included sex, education, loneliness, self-
rated health, physical activity level, dependence in ADLs,
falls in previous year, need for assistance in walking, visual
impairment, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Factors
consistently associated at all ages with not going out daily
at 78, 85, and 90 were male sex, low physical activity,
dependence in ADLs; factors also showing repeated associ-
ations were educational status and self-rated (ages 78 and
85), need for walking assistance (age 78 and 90), and
visual
impairment
(ages
78
and
85)
(Supplementary
Table S5).
The association between frequency of leaving the
house and survival at different stages during follow-up
were examined in Kaplan-Meier charts (Figure 1); 81.4%
of subjects leaving daily at age 70, 84.2% of those leaving
often, and 38.5% of those leaving rarely survived to age
78; 71.0% of subjects leaving daily at age 78, 67.4% of
those leaving often, and of 44.3% those leaving rarely sur-
vived to age 85; 74.3% of subjects leaving daily at age 85,
60.9% of those leaving often, and 41.4% of those leaving
rarely survived to age 90, and 64.4% of subjects leaving
daily at age 90, 56.2.% of those leaving often, and 37.7%
of those leaving rarely survived to age 95 (all log rank
P < .001).
Unadjusted analyses showed that subjects leaving daily
throughout the entire period of follow-up consistently
were significantly less likely to die than those leaving
rarely (Table 1). After adjustment for social, functional,
and medical covariates, the magnitude of this effect was
smaller, although it remained significant at all ages and in
14 of the 16 models (apart from the combined model at
age 70 and the functional model at age 78). Similarly, in
unadjusted analyses, subjects who left often were signifi-
cantly less likely to die than those who left rarely at all
ages during follow-up. The magnitude of this effect was
smaller than for subjects leaving daily. After adjustment,
the magnitude of this effect remained consistent, although
the association was not significant after adjustment for
functional covariates (at ages 78, 85, and 90) and medical
comorbidities (at ages 78 and 90). After excluding subjects
who died within 6 months of follow-up, results remained
unchanged in either direction or magnitude of effect.
A similar pattern of highest survival in subjects leaving
daily followed by often followed by rarely was also
observed at ages 70, 78, and 85, when subjects were sepa-
rately analyzed when grouped according to ability to walk
without assistive device, ability to walk with an assistive
device, and unable to walk. Subjects who went out often
or daily who were able to walk with or without an assis-
tive devise were significantly less likely to die than those
who went out rarely. Insufficient numbers of those aged
70 to 85 who were not able to walk prevented statistical
analyses. At age 90, data were missing for 229 subjects
regarding use of assistive device
or wheel chair bound.
Subjects with missing data on this question were more
likely to have dementia, be dependent in ADLs, report
poor self-rated health, and rarely leave the house. It is
likely that the small number of subjects who were unable
to walk observed at age 90 is explained by these missing
data.
DISCUSSION
This study describes the relationship between the fre-
quency of leaving the house between ages 70 and 90 and
subsequent mortality in a representative community-dwell-
ing
sample.
The
primary
finding
to
emerge,
which
remained consistent with increasing age, was the signifi-
cant association between greater frequency of leaving the
house,
longer
survival,
and
lower
mortality
over
an
extended
follow-up
period.
The
greatest
effect
was
observed with highest frequency of leaving the house
(daily) and was independent of social vulnerability, func-
tional decline, physical activity, and medical comorbidities.
Although the significance of this association was weaker in
subjects leaving less frequently (often) after adjustment for
functional variables, the overall pattern of the study find-
ings was also observed in these subjects throughout the

 entire trajectory of aging from young to oldest old. Fur-
thermore, this effect appeared to be independent of mobil-
ity status, as observed in separate analyses of subgroups
who were able to walk with or without an assistive aid.
To the best our knowledge, this is the first study to consis-
tently describe the association between mortality and fre-
quency of leaving the house over an extended period of
time in the same cohort of subjects as they advance in age
from age 70 to 90.
Strengths and weaknesses of this study
Study personnel interviewed all subjects in their own
homes, enabling the inclusion of homebound individuals
and those with mobility difficulties. The study data are
drawn from a well-established research cohort previously
proven to be representative of the local community-dwell-
ing elderly population18,19 and closely resembling several
cohorts from aging studies in industrialized countries, shar-
ing a similar health, disease, psychosocial, and functional
status profile.31,32 Limitations deserve mention. Compre-
hensive details were lacking regarding where, why, and for
what purpose older people left their houses, as was infor-
mation about local urban environmental factors that may
have served as facilitators of or barriers to leaving the
house. Similarly, the effect of leaving the house on positive
measures such as well-being, autonomy, meaning, and
sense of purpose were outside the scope and depth of our
study. Care should be taken in interpreting observational
findings, and causal relationships between leaving the
house and survival cannot be inferred. There is a possibil-
ity of reverse causation, and although excluding subjects
who died in the first 6 months of follow-up did not affect
our results, nonetheless lower frequency of going out was
associated with a negative set of health parameters, and
adjustment may not have been entirely complete.
Comparison with other studies
The effect of mobility on health has been examined from
several different research perspectives, specifically in the
context of physical performance measures, physical activ-
ity, life-space mobility, and environmental studies.33,34
Recently the life-space mobility measure has gained atten-
tion as a composite “ecological” measure, reflecting motor
mobility and degree of interaction with the environment,
within and outside the home. Similarly, the influence that
environmental factors, such as urban design and trans-
portation availability, may exert in promoting or present-
ing barriers to older people’s ability to leave the house is a
growing area of interest.33,34
The few studies that have investigated the association
between frequency of leaving the house and mortality have
used measures of life-space mobility. Less life-space mobil-
ity has been found to be associated with greater mortality
during follow-up lasting 2.7 years in men (mean age 84),10
5 years in women (mean age 87),9 and 8 years (mean age
78)8 (as well as predicting “frailty-free mortality” over
3 years of follow-up) in subjects aged 65 and older.12 In
addition, a recent preceding decline in baseline life-space
mobility was predictive of mortality at 6 months in sub-
jects aged 75 and older.11 The association with mortality
has been shown to remain significant after adjustment for
a variety of common social, functional, and medical con-
founding factors in study populations that were heteroge-
neous in age. Our study, which used a pragmatic measure
of frequency of leaving the house, extends these findings to
an age-homogeneous cohort. Furthermore, our findings
reinforce the consistency of the relationship between leav-
ing the house and mortality, not only irrespective of
advancing age per se, but also independent of the rising
burden of social vulnerability, functional decline, and med-
ical comorbidity that was observed between ages 70 and
90. The simple question “How often do you get out the
house?” serves as a simple, pragmatic proxy for the more
complex measure of life-space mobility and, in the clinical
setting, may be of relevance to healthcare professionals in
assessing risk and a means to encourage engagement out-
side of the house.
The positive influence of physical activity on health
measures and survival in older people, including the oldest
old, is well documented. Nonetheless, in addition to the
benefits of remaining active, the independent negative
influence of time being sedentary has been the subject of
research. Using self-reported and objective measures from
accelerometry, findings from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Study found that time spent being
sedentary in older people was a separate mortality risk
factor, independent of time spent or levels of physical
activity.35,36 Physical activity levels in our study sample
has been well documented and shown to be associated
with and predictive of subsequent functional status, health-
care use, health and survival in individuals with diabetes
mellitus,
and
mortality
throughout
follow-up.24,26,37,38
The current study adjusted for physical activity level, sug-
gesting that the longer survival associated with frequently
going out is independent of the benefits of physical activ-
ity. Nonetheless, lower frequency of going out may be an
indirect proxy measure for more time being sedentary.
Our study included subjects who walked indepen-
dently or required an assistive device, as well as a small
number of those who were unable to walk. Despite mobil-
ity limitations, sizable proportions of subjects continued to
leave the house daily or often. When analyzed separately,
the effect on mortality of frequently leaving the house
remained significant in these subgroups. These findings
lend support to the wider positive influence that leaving
the house appears to have on older adults, irrespective of
their potential physical and mobility disabilities.
In contrast, our findings shed light on a growing pop-
ulation of older people who are frequently beyond the
reach not only of researchers, but also of healthcare provi-
ders. Of those who went out 1 time per week or less, the
frequency of being homebound in this representative urban
cohort was 6.6% at age 70, 10% at 78, 17% at 85 and
40.3% at 90. Using a similar frequency of leaving the
house of 1 time per week or less to define mostly home-
bound and less than 1 time per month as completely
homebound, cross-sectional data from the National Health
and Aging Trends Study United States 2011 found that
4.5% of subjects were mostly homebound and 1.1% were
completely homebound.1 In their study sample, which
included 7,600 community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries
aged 65 and older, homebound subjects were older and

 more socially vulnerable and had more medical comorbidi-
ties and higher rates of healthcare use and hospitalization.
Only 11.9% of completely individuals and 4.9% of those
who were mostly homebound reported receiving primary
care services at home.
The findings from our study identify a steep rise in
being housebound after the age of 85, accompanied by a
rising burden of negative health and functional parameters.
Nonetheless, even at advanced ages, going out continues
to predict survival, after adjusting for the growing comor-
bidity, social vulnerability, and functional decline. Fre-
quency
of

undoubtedly
reflects
numerous
domains of aging, spanning different disciplines. Similar to
the more complex measure of life-space mobility, it is
likely that the frequency of leaving the house among older
people is influenced by a wide range of factors including
neighborhood design and accessibility to transport facil-
ities; environmental issues; biological and person-specific
factors such as motor mobility, measures of physical per-
formance, cognitive and psychological status, frailty and
medical morbidity; socioeconomic and cultural domains;
and deeper issues of aging that draw upon perceptions of
autonomy, enablement, and empowerment of older people.
As several researchers have indicated,8–11 these many fac-
tors make it difficult to develop a single conceptual basis
by which the association between leaving the house and
survival might be explained. Taken as a global measure,
frequency of leaving the house might serve as a proxy for
resiliency and engagement in older people, whose contin-
ued exposure and interaction with the world outside of
their home reflects and reinforces positive and successful
aspects of aging.
It is tempting to assume that the health of older peo-
ple may be improved by increasing accessibility, creating
environments that make it easier for them to leave the
house, and improving social support aimed at encouraging
activities outside of the house.33,34 Observational data
such as ours cannot be used to suggest causality. Faced
with the growing prevalence of homebound older people,
interventions aimed at making it easier for older people to
leave their house, encouraging an active nonsedentary life-
style, and promoting continued engagement in activities
outside of the home are required. Prospective studies are
required to determine whether the negative outcomes and
health
burden
associated
with
becoming
increasingly
homebound can be ameliorated, delayed, or even reversed.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
This observational study of a representative community-
dwelling cohort found a significant association between
frequency of leaving the house throughout follow-up from
age 70 to 90 and mortality, adjusting for social, func-
tional, and medical status.
