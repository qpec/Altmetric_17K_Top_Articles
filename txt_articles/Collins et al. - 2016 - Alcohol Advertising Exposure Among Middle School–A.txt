ABSTRACT. Objective: The purpose of this study was to quantify
middle school youth’s exposure to alcohol advertisements across media
and venues, determine venues of greatest exposure, and identify char-
acteristics of youth who are most exposed. Method: Over a 10-month
period in 2013, 589 Los Angeles–area youth ages 11–14 from diverse
racial/ethnic backgrounds completed a short paper-and-pencil survey
assessing background characteristics and then participated in a 14-day
ecological momentary assessment, logging all exposures to alcohol ad-
vertisements on handheld computers as they occurred. Results: African
American and Hispanic youth were exposed to an average of 4.1 and
3.4 advertisements per day, respectively, nearly two times as many as
non-Hispanic White youth, who were exposed to 2.0 advertisements per
day. Girls were exposed to 30% more advertisements than boys. Most
exposures were to outdoor advertisements, with television advertise-
ments a close second. Conclusions: Exposure to alcohol advertising
is frequent among middle school–age youth and may put them at risk
for earlier or more frequent underage drinking. Greater restrictions on
alcohol advertising outdoors and on television should be considered by
regulators and by the alcohol industry and should focus particularly on
reducing exposure among minority youth. (J. Stud. Alcohol Drugs, 77,

I
N THE UNITED STATES, 70%–80% of adolescents have
consumed alcohol, and half have been drunk by the end
of high school (Eaton et al., 2012; Johnston et al., 2014).
Underage drinking is a major public health problem, con-
tributing to a host of problems during youth and later in life
(Ellickson et al., 2003; Grant & Dawson, 1997; Hingson et
al., 2001, 2009; Stueve & O’Donnell, 2005).
Studies indicate that exposure to alcohol advertising
may hasten initiation of drinking and increase consumption
among underage drinkers (Anderson et al., 2009; Collins et
al., 2007; Ellickson et al., 2005; Snyder et al., 2006). Other
research extends these associations to youth problem drink-
ing (Grenard, 2013; Morgenstern et al., 2014; Tanski et al.,
2015) and bolsters causal interpretation with evidence of
brand-specific associations (Siegel et al., 2016), and pro-
cesses mediating and moderating associations (e.g., attitudes,
Morgenstern et al., 2011; self-control, Wills et al., 2010).
This evidence raises substantial concern about the contribu-
tion of advertising to underage drinking. However, the extent
of this concern should be proportionate to the level of youth
exposure to alcohol advertising. We know surprisingly little
about this. The alcohol industry has self-regulatory proce-
dures in place to ensure that youth are not more likely than
adults to be exposed to any individual advertisement (Federal
Trade Commission, 2014). However, this standard does not
address, and tells us nothing about, the percentage of youth
exposed to alcohol advertising overall or the frequency of
youth exposure.
Only one study has provided an estimate of something
close to total alcohol advertising exposure among youth.
Snyder and colleagues (2006) surveyed youth ages 15–26
residing in 75 major alcohol markets and estimated that
they were exposed to an average of 23 alcohol advertise-
ments each month across television, radio, magazines, and
billboards—approximately 0.76 advertisements each day.
However, their estimates were based on retrospective self-
reports, and a portion of reports was made on Likert scales
and recoded to numeric values (e.g., “some” became “3”);
therefore, they are inexact at best. The study also omitted
wine advertisements, online advertisements, promotional
items, and product placements. More accurate and current
estimates of total exposure are sorely needed.
It is also important to determine through which media or
venues youth are most likely to be exposed to alcohol adver-
tisements. With this information, policy makers could focus
on reducing advertising in these places, or parents could
limit youth exposure to them. There are some published data
about alcohol advertising exposure in specific media and
venues. Using Nielsen television ratings data, researchers
from the Center on Alcohol Marketing and Y
outh (2010c)
found that the average person ages 12–20 in the United
States is exposed to one television alcohol advertisement
per day. Other studies provide rates of exposure to outdoor
advertisements, radio advertisements, advertisements in
magazines, and ownership of promotional items. But these

data generally appear in separate studies with different
samples, study years, and locations of data collection, and no
study has assessed rates of exposure to product placements,
online advertisements, or newspaper advertisements. Thus, it
is impossible to determine where the highest rates of alcohol
advertising exposure occur.
Last, we have only sporadic information about the rela-
tive exposure of various demographic groups to alcohol ad-
vertising. It has been speculated that younger adolescents
are more vulnerable to alcohol advertising effects than
older youth (Collins et al., 2007); therefore, testing wheth-
er they are exposed to advertisements as often is especially
important. One study found that boys are more exposed
to television advertisements than girls and that African
Americans are more exposed to television advertisements
than Whites (Ringel et al., 2006). Another study found
that girls see more alcohol advertising in magazines than
boys (Jernigan et al., 2004). Still other studies found that
African Americans are exposed to more alcohol advertising
in magazines, billboards, and storefronts than other youth
(Alaniz, 1998; Altman et al., 1991; Hackbarth et al., 1995;
McKee et al., 2011). Some associations between exposure
and race/ethnicity may stem from greater use of media
among minorities (Rideout, 2015).
It is unsurprising that little data on these important
issues are available. Measuring the amount of alcohol
advertising exposure among youth in and across multiple
media and venues is difficult, requiring a comprehensive
set of assessments tapping a broad array of circumstances.
Surveys asking youth to recall advertisements they saw or
heard by retrospecting over a period of time are subject to
recall bias (Hammersley, 1994) and, if comprehensive in
their coverage of media and venues, highly burdensome for
participants.
We undertook the Tracking and Recording Alcohol
Communications (TRAC) study to address these issues and
other related gaps in our knowledge. TRAC youth partici-
pate in ecological momentary assessment (EMA), logging
each alcohol advertisement they encounter for 14 days,
immediately upon exposure, using a handheld electronic
device. They also respond to a short survey that includes
questions about the advertisement. This method captures
the number and types of advertisements to which youth
are exposed without relying on participants’ recall or re-
quiring them to complete a survey item for every medium
and venue of potential exposure. EMA has proven to be a
valuable tool for minimizing recall biases and obtaining
a detailed portrait of behavioral contexts. We report data
from the baseline EMA data collection that took place
from September 2013 through June 2014. We used a roll-
ing enrollment process (each 14-day data-collection period
began as another was concluding, with new enrollees) so
that data cover nearly a full calendar year (10 months) of
advertising.
Method
Procedures were approved by RAND’
s institutional review
board. Parents/guardians provided consent, and adolescents
provided assent for participation.
TRAC is a longitudinal study. We recruited 606 middle
school students from two large school districts, afterschool
clubs, and community organizations in Southern California
with flyers and other notices. One school district includes a
large city, smaller municipalities, unincorporated areas, and
both high- and low-income neighborhoods. The other district
includes small, middle-income cities and their surrounds.
The two districts have very different racial/ethnic compo-
sition. One district is 30% White, 4% African American,
23% Hispanic, and 43% other race; the other is 9% White,
10% African American, 73% Hispanic, and 8% other race.
Recruiting across both districts allowed us to capture more
diverse youth and settings. Because prior studies have found
differential exposure to alcohol advertising by race/ethnic-
ity, a key goal was to recruit sufficient numbers of White,
Hispanic, and African American youth to power accurate
within- and between-group estimates. Thus, we focused re-
cruiting on neighborhoods and afterschool clubs within each
district with concentrations of a given race/ethnicity (e.g.,
predominantly African American or predominantly White).
At baseline and every 8 months thereafter, students com-
plete a paper survey assessing demographics, social context
(e.g., parental and peer characteristics), and drinking behav-
ior. Each paper assessment is followed by a 2-week EMA
during which students report any alcohol advertising they
observe via handheld computers. Thus, there are multiple
waves of device data; this article focuses on the baseline
wave.
Participants underwent a 1-day training session on the
operation of the handheld devices and on the study definition
of an alcohol advertisement. Participants were instructed to
keep their device turned on at all times, charge the device
at night while they slept, respond to random prompts issued
by the device, and initiate data entry each time they encoun-
tered an alcohol advertisement. Participants were told that
they should only record advertisements that they naturally
encountered and should not deviate from their normal ac-
tivities to “find” advertisements. They were trained to report
exposure to a broad range of advertising types in a variety
of venues and media. Multiple examples were provided of
television, radio, newspaper, mailed flyer, and magazine
advertisements; billboards and transit advertisements; signs
outside bars, restaurants, and convenience stores; signs and
logos seen during live or televised sporting events; sponsor-
ship of music and sporting events or individual athletes,
musicians, or actors; retail point-of-sale (POS) advertise-
ments (i.e., posters, product displays, and placards inside
grocery stores, convenience stores, restaurants, and bars);
brand-logoed promotional items such as hats, t-shirts, and
 386

glassware; and various forms of online advertising, including
Google search advertisements, email advertisements, banner
advertisements, streaming advertisements, alcohol-branded
websites, and advertisements appearing on social network-
ing sites or mobile applications such as Facebook, Twitter,
Instagram, and Tumblr. Trainings also provided examples of
drinking in movies and music, and participants were taught
to distinguish portrayals that are incidental or generic versus
portrayals constituting product placements in which an alco-
hol brand is evident.
Before leaving the study center, participants practiced re-
cording an advertisement (practice data were excluded from
analysis). Participants then carried the device with them at
all times for 14 days but were instructed to leave the device
in their locker or backpack while at school. All device func-
tions besides the EMA software were disabled. At the end of
the assessment, participants returned the device to the study
center where data were uploaded. Participants earned $60 for
completing these procedures.
Exposure surveys
At each advertisement exposure, participants were
asked first to categorize the advertising venue or medium
as follows: “What type of ad did you see? (select one) . . .
television, print (newspaper, magazine, etc.), radio, outdoor
(billboard, store window, etc.), indoor (e.g., inside a store or
restaurant), item with a brand name (e.g., hat, shirt), online
ad (e.g., banner or side ad), product placement (e.g., in a
movie), or other?”
Participants were then asked to categorize the beverage
type in the advertisement: “What type of alcoholic drink is
advertised? (check all that apply) . . . beer, wine, liquor (e.g.,
Captain Morgan’
s rum, Absolut vodka), other alcoholic drink
(e.g., Bacardi Breezer, Mike’s Hard Lemonade), or don’t
know/can’t tell?”
Advertisement reports were time stamped and date
stamped electronically.
Random prompts
To test hypotheses not examined in the current report,
participants were also prompted by the device, three times
each day, to complete very brief assessments of their
alcohol-related beliefs. Prompts were audible and spread
throughout the waking day.
Participant characteristics
Characteristics of participants measured by the baseline
paper survey included gender, age in years, family structure
(lives with both parents vs. other), weekly hours of televi-
sion viewing, and whether they had ever had a whole drink
of alcohol.
Analysis
Five participants lost or broke their devices, and their data
were irretrievable. Another 13 participants responded to less
than 1% of random prompts, suggesting poor overall data
quality; their data were not included in analyses. Thus, the
analytic sample consisted of 589 youth.
Best practices for survey research include correction for
nonresponse, which can bias estimates if left unaddressed
(Rubin, 1996). It was not possible to directly observe failure
to report advertisement exposures (a form of nonresponse),
but we could do so with regard to random prompts. On av-
erage, random prompt compliance was 67%. Hispanics and
African Americans exhibited lower compliance than Whites;
having a sibling in the sample and getting good grades were
positively associated with compliance. Examination of ad-
vertisement reports revealed a very large drop in reported
exposures on the 14th (final) day of monitoring, suggesting
that most participants were not aware they should report
exposures on this day. We therefore only examine reporting
on the first 13 days of event sampling. Last, detailed analyses
of the advertisement-exposure data provided evidence of a
fatigue effect (Courvoisier et al., 2012): Respondents re-
ported fewer advertisements as the 13-day period progressed.
To more accurately represent the level of advertisement
exposure throughout the data-collection period, we derived
nonresponse weights to correct for participant differences in
compliance and reporting fatigue (technical notes available
on request).
Analyses consist of weighted point estimates (means and
percentages), as well as t tests for differences in advertise-
ment exposure across demographic groups. As a validity
check, we also examined bivariate associations between
hours of television viewing and exposure to advertisements
on television and in other venues.
Results
The 589 participants were about evenly distributed across
ages 11–14, 46% were female, 62% were from intact nuclear
family households, and 3% had ever had a drink of alcohol.
As anticipated, Hispanics, non-Hispanic Whites, and African
Americans were about equally represented (at 26%, 25%,
and 29%, respectively; 21% were another race). This racial
and ethnic makeup differs from that for the two school dis-
tricts where we recruited and from the nation but provides
adequate samples for making comparisons across groups.
These individuals logged exposures to a total of 6,695 alco-
hol advertisements across the 13-day period. After applying
nonresponse weights to these data, we estimate participants
were exposed to 23,446 advertisements or approximately
3.1 advertisements per youth per day. To provide a sense of
what might be expected in a sample with the same racial/
ethnic composition as the United States (17% Hispanic, 62%
 COLLINS ET AL.
387
non-Hispanic White, 13% African American, 8% other), we
weighted to this population, obtaining an estimate of 2.7
advertisements per day for the average middle school student
nationally.
Exposure venue and beverage type
Thirty-eight percent of alcohol advertisements seen by
youth were outdoor advertisements, representing the largest
exposure venue (Table 1). The second largest percentage was
television, at 26%. Other venues accounted for substantially
fewer advertisements. This means that the average youth
was exposed to 1.18 outdoor advertisements, 0.8 television
advertisements, and 1.08 advertisements for alcohol across
other or unknown venues, each day. Two thirds (66%) of all
advertisements seen were for beer, 23% for distilled spirits,
and 17% for wine, translating to 2.01 advertisements per
youth per day for beer, 0.69 for distilled spirits, and 0.53 for
wine.
Beer was the most commonly encountered alcoholic
beverage across every advertising venue (Table 2). But there
was also variation in the mix of beverage types by venue.
The print advertisements to which youth were exposed had
by far the greatest proportion of wine advertisements (30%)
relative to other venues. Product-placement exposures had
the highest percentage of distilled-spirit advertisements
(27%) relative to other venues. Advertisements for beer,
wine, and distilled spirits were all most commonly encoun-
tered outdoors (not tabled), with outdoor ads making up
42%, 34%, and 34% of beer, wine, and distilled spirit ads,
respectively, and television ads making up 28%, 21%, and
29% of ads within each beverage category. Sixteen percent
of wine ads appeared in print, while each other venue ac-
counted for less than 10% of ads for a given beverage.
Demographic differences in exposure
Overall, girls saw more advertisements than boys (3.5
vs. 2.7 advertisements per day; t = 2.45, p < .05, df = 468).
Girls and boys saw equal numbers of television advertise-
ments (p = .50), but girls were more exposed than boys to
outdoor advertisements (t = 2.44, p < .05, df = 468) and to
advertisements in other venues (t = 3.06, p < .01, df = 468).
As shown in Figure 1, African American and Hispanic youth
(4.1 and 3.4 advertisements per day, respectively) saw more
advertisements than non-Hispanic Whites (2.0 advertise-
ments per day) (Hispanic vs. White: t = 3.20, p < .01, df =
198, and African American vs. White: t = 5.20, p < .01, df =
266). This same pattern was observed for television adver-

tisements, outdoor advertisements, and advertisements in
other venues (all ps < .01). There were no age differences in
advertisement-exposure rates.
Hours of television viewing
Y
outh who watched less than an hour of television each
day reported exposure to fewer advertisements overall (p =
.04, df = 563) and fewer television advertisements, specifi-
cally (p = .02, df = 563), than those who watched 1–3 hours.
No differences were observed for those who watched 4
hours or more compared with the 1–3 hour group. Television
viewing was unrelated to exposure to alcohol advertisements
outdoors or for venues other than television and outdoors.
Discussion
Our study is the first to estimate total amount of alcohol
advertising exposure among youth. We found that Southern
California middle schoolers are exposed to a little more than
three advertisements for alcohol each day. The largest share
of these exposures is to outdoor advertising—billboards and
signs outside stores and bars. Nearly as many are attributable
to television viewing. We also found that girls are more ex-
posed than boys, and African American and Hispanic youth
are substantially more exposed than Whites.
With the exception of a small feasibility study (Scharf
et al., 2013), our method has not previously been applied to
estimating the frequency of alcohol advertising exposure.
Prior studies have used EMA to estimate the prevalence or
frequency of urges to smoke, eating behavior, pain, and emo-
FIGURE 1.
Racial and ethnic differences in exposure to alcohol advertising
tional experience (Shiffman et al., 2002; Steptoe & Wardle,
2011; Stone & Broderick, 2007; Thomas et al., 2011). One
study used EMA to estimate exposure to pro-tobacco mar-
keting, finding that patterns of such exposure converge with
data concerning the most advertised cigarette brands, as well
as advertising expenditures across various media, suggesting
the validity of their EMA measures (Martino et al., 2012).
Similarly, some of the patterns observed and estimates
obtained herein mirror those of studies that have focused
on a smaller part of the overall alcohol advertising picture.
That most advertisements reported were for beer fits with
prior studies, as does the finding that wine advertisements
appeared disproportionately often in print media relative
to other venues (Center on Alcohol Marketing and Y
outh,
2010b). Our finding that youth who watch more television
see more television advertisements, but not more advertise-
ments in other venues, also lends validity to reports. Also
telling is the concordance of our estimate of exposure to 0.8
television advertisements per youth per day (an estimate that
does not change if we weight it to account for our minority
oversample) with a prior estimate of 1 television advertise-
ment per youth per day based on Nielsen ratings (Center on
Alcohol Marketing and Y
outh, 2010c).
We cannot directly validate youth’s EMA reports, al-
though we note that this same limitation applies to surveys
that ask youth to recall advertisements and even to Nielsen
ratings. Moreover, a recent study (Scherer et al., 2015) found
that reports of media use collected throughout the day via
EMA closely align with reports of media use collected using
detailed daily diaries. Although the dependent measure in
that study differs somewhat from our own, it does enhance
 COLLINS ET AL.
389
the credibility of our participants’ reports. If youth failed to
fully comply with the task of reporting advertisements for
our study, we may have underestimated advertisement expo-
sure. Our weighting scheme, however, takes underreporting
into account and adjusts for factors related to it.
Alongside our convergence with prior data, we bring a
great deal of new information. Our finding that youth are
most often exposed through outdoor advertisements suggests
that tighter restrictions may be needed on such advertise-
ments. It is possible that this finding is specific to the urban
environment and transit patterns of Southern California.
Nonetheless, it warrants close attention to, and further re-
search examining, outdoor alcohol advertising practices as
they relate to children.
No study has previously documented the greater exposure
of girls to alcohol advertising overall. Greater use of print
media among girls and videogames among boys (and thus
more time indoors) may partially account for the difference
(Rideout, 2015). Girls and boys were equally exposed to
television advertisements for alcohol, failing to replicate a
prior study (Ringel et al., 2006). Sports viewership is not
as strongly segmented by gender as it was (Deitsch, 2014;
Nielsen Company, 2014), and advertisers are placing more
alcohol advertisements outside sports programming (Ross et
al., 2014). Thus, more alcohol advertisements may be reach-
ing girls through television than in the past.
Others have found greater exposure of African American
youth to television, magazine (Center on Alcohol Marketing
and Y
outh, 2010a; Ringel et al., 2006), and outdoor alcohol
advertisements (McKee et al., 2011), and greater exposure
of Hispanic youth through magazines (Center on Alcohol
Marketing and Y
outh, 2005) and outdoor advertisements
(Pasch et al., 2009). We extend these results to all advertis-
ing sources and find much greater disparities. Some of this
difference is attributable to greater use of media among
Hispanics and African Americans. A recent report indicates
that African American youth spend about 8 hours a day with
media, Hispanics a little less than 7 hours, and Whites a little
more than 5 hours (Rideout, 2015). However, media use can-
not account for greater exposure to outdoor advertisements,
suggesting that advertisers could be targeting these racial/
ethnic groups.
Exposure to few online advertisements was reported.
Major brands do use Y
ouTube and other social media popu-
lar with youth (Federal Trade Commission, 2014; Peterson,
2014). Y
outh under 13 are not permitted on Facebook, and
Y
ouTube offers alcohol marketers a method of screening out
those under 21 (Federal Trade Commission, 2014). Nonethe-
less, these age restrictions are easily circumvented (Madden
et al., 2013), so it is unclear to what extent they affect our
findings. It is possible that higher estimates of online expo-
sure would be obtained in an older sample.
POS promotions of alcohol have been little studied (El-
lickson et al., 2005, and Hurtz et al., 2007, are exceptions)
but constitute nearly a third of the advertising budget for
the major beverage companies. We classified some POS
promotions as outdoor advertisements because youth found
them easier to record as such (e.g., signs displayed in store
windows facing outdoors). This may partly account for our
low numbers. Regardless, youth in our study reported little
exposure to POS promotions indoors, suggesting that they
are not spending a great deal of time in stores or restaurants
where alcohol is advertised.
It is important to note that the kinds of advertisements to
which youth are most exposed may not be those most likely
to influence them to drink. Television advertisements may
be more persuasive because they can present an engaging
narrative (Green & Brock, 2000). Sponsorships of events
may conflate love of team or a celebrity with love of an
alcohol brand in an adolescent’s mind or invoke processes
that incorporate the brand in the youth’s identity (e.g., “I’m
a Heineken kind of guy”).
Y
outh may also differ in their receptivity to advertising
(e.g., Austin et al., 2006; Henriksen et al., 2008; McClure
et al., 2013; Tanski et al., 2015). In a recent study based on
the same data set examined here (Martino et al., 2016), we
found that youth perceived the typical person their age who
drinks alcohol more favorably, and alcohol use as more nor-
mative, when they were exposed to alcohol advertisements.
Although true among youth of all racial/ethnic backgrounds,
effects were greater and more likely among Whites. There-
fore, although minority youth were more heavily exposed to
advertising in the present study, they may be less receptive
to it. This is in line with a number of other studies (Brown et
al., 2006; Gibbons et al., 2010; Tanski et al., 2012). Much re-
mains to be learned about whether, when, and why youth are
more receptive to alcohol advertising to provide appropriate
context for interpreting exposure rates. It is also important
to put any influence of advertising in the context of other
contributors to underage drinking. Although both African
American and Hispanic youth are more exposed to alcohol
advertisements than Whites, only Hispanic youth are more
likely to drink (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
2014).
A few limitations of our study should be noted. Students
in urban Southern California typically commute to school
through areas populated with gas stations, mini-malls, and
billboards where there are ample opportunities for advertis-
ing exposure. Results may not describe youth in settings
without these characteristics. The study was conducted with
a racial and ethnic mix different from the national aver-
age. However, the estimates we obtained for racial/ethnic
subgroups are not affected by this. Our 3% rate of lifetime
drinking is lower than the expected rate of 10%–12% for a
cohort of similar age and racial mix (National Survey on
Drug Use and Health, 2013). This may indicate a bias in our
sample, perhaps associated with the burden of participation
and the characteristics of youth who have sufficient time

and energy to comply with our procedures. Because alcohol
advertising is targeted, we might observe a higher rate of
advertising exposure in a group that includes more drinkers.
Finally, youth might underreport exposure to more subtle
forms of advertising such as product placements.
We are unable to weight for such effects, but this might
bias (downward) both the total number of advertisements
reported and the percentages in these categories. Our data-
collection period excluded July and August. If youth spend
time with different media or in different places during these
months, or more or fewer advertisements are shown then,
alcohol advertisement exposures may differ from what we
observed. Nonetheless, our data represent more than 80%
of the calendar year and thus the vast majority of opportuni-
ties for advertisement exposure. Our method for estimating
product placements may misclassify some instances where
alcohol brands appear as a result of an artistic decision
rather than a paid promotion. Few product placements were
reported; therefore, this potential overcounting minimally
affects estimates of total exposure. Finally, we did not col-
lect data regarding the brands to which youth were exposed.
Identifying the brands that reach more youth, and the ven-
ues in which these exposures occur, could help to address
failures in industry self-regulation of advertising practices.
Thus, future studies should include brand measures.
Conclusions
Our study indicates that middle school youth in urban
Southern California see two to four advertisements for al-
cohol each day, depending on their race and ethnicity. These
levels warrant intervention by policy makers, practitioners,
and parents.
