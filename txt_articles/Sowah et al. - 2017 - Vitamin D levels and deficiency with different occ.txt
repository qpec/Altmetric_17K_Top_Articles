Abstract
Background: Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent worldwide, but some groups are at greater risk. We aim to evaluate
vitamin D levels in different occupations and identify groups vulnerable to vitamin D deficiency.
Methods: An electronic search conducted in Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials,
and CINAHL Plus with Full Text generated 2505 hits; 71 peer-reviewed articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria.
Occupations investigated included outdoor and indoor workers, shiftworkers, lead/smelter workers, coalminers, and
healthcare professionals. We calculated the pooled average metabolite level as mean ± SD; deficiency/insufficiency
status was described as % of the total number of subjects in a given category.
Results: Compared to outdoor workers, indoor workers had lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-(OH)D) levels (40.
6 ± 13.3 vs. 66.7 ± 16.7 nmol/L; p < 0.0001). Mean 25-(OH)D levels (in nmol/L) in shiftworkers, lead/smelter workers
and coalminers were 33.8 ± 10.0, 77.8 ± 5.4 and 56.6 ± 28.4, respectively. Vitamin D deficiency (25-(OH)
D < 50 nmol/L), was high in shiftworkers (80%) and indoor workers (78%) compared to outdoor workers (48%).
Among healthcare professionals, medical residents and healthcare students had the lowest levels of mean 25-(OH)
D, 44.0 ± 8.3 nmol/L and 45.2 ± 5.5 nmol/L, respectively. The mean 25-(OH)D level of practising physicians, 55.0 ± 5.
8 nmol/L, was significantly different from both medical residents (p < 0.0001) and healthcare students (p < 0.0001).
Nurses and other healthcare employees had 25-(OH)D levels of 63.4 ± 4.2 nmol/L and 63.0 ± 11.0 nmol/L,
respectively, which differed significantly compared to practising physicians (p = 0.01), medical residents (p < 0.0001)
and healthcare students (p < 0.0001).
Rates of vitamin D deficiency among healthcare professionals were: healthcare students 72%, medical residents
65%, practising physicians 46%, other healthcare employees 44%, and nurses 43%. Combined rates of vitamin D
deficiency or insufficiency (25-(OH)D < 75 nmol/L) were very high in all investigated groups.
Potential confounders such as gender and body composition were not consistently reported in the primary studies
and were therefore not analyzed. Furthermore, the descriptions of occupational characteristics may be incomplete.
These are limitations of our systematic review.
Conclusions: Our review demonstrates that shiftworkers, healthcare workers and indoor workers are at high risk to
develop vitamin D deficiency, which may reflect key lifestyle differences (e.g. sunlight exposure). This may help
target health promotion and preventive efforts.

 Background
Although there has been recent improvement in vitamin
D status in the North American population, the preva-
lence of insufficiency remains high. About 70%–97% of
Canadians are estimated to demonstrate vitamin D in-
sufficiency [1] and approximately 40% of the US popula-
tion are estimated to be vitamin D deficient [2]. While
vitamin D has traditionally been shown to be involved in
calcium homeostasis [1] and bone health [2], recent evi-
dence suggests several roles not limited to the musculo-
skeletal system. An inadequate level of vitamin D has
been linked to a number of diseases including metabolic
disorders, autoimmune conditions, psychiatric, respira-
tory and cardiovascular disorders, and cancers as well as
osteoporosis and osteomalacia [2–4]. The widespread
systemic effects of vitamin D have been attributed to the
ubiquitous expression of vitamin D receptors in various
organ systems [2, 5].
Vitamin D is synthesized in vivo when solar ultraviolet
B (UVB) radiation interacts with the precursor molecule,
7-dehydrocholesterol, in the skin [2, 6, 7]. Another im-
portant source of vitamin D is dietary intake and supple-
mentation,
although
endogenous
production
is
estimated to account for 90% of total vitamin D in
healthy individuals, and any activity that reduces sun-
light exposure will tend to reduce vitamin D levels [2, 8].
Whether
from
endogenous
production
or
dietary
sources, vitamin D is subsequently transported in the
blood (bound to vitamin D-binding protein) to the liver
where it is hydroxylated to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-
(OH)D) [7]. 25-(OH)D is further converted to the meta-
bolically active form, 1α, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1α, 25-
(OH)2D), primarily in the kidneys [9]. In the present
study, the term ‘vitamin D’ was used in the context of
status, i.e., deficiency, insufficiency or sufficiency, while
25-(OH)D referred to serum levels of the metabolite.
Because of its half-life in blood of ~2–5 weeks, the cir-
culating concentration of 25-(OH)D has been used as a
measure of vitamin D status in individuals [6]. Serum 25-
(OH)D concentrations lower than 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL)
appear to be detrimental to bone health [10]; however, op-
timal serum 25-(OH)D concentrations have not been
established with respect to other outcomes, and there is
lack of agreement on how deficiency should be defined, or
how best to conduct population-based screening for vita-
min D deficiency [11]. Despite a lack of consensus on op-
timal levels, it is becoming abundantly evident that
vitamin D deficiency and its associated untoward health
outcomes are a worldwide phenomenon [12, 13].
As vitamin D synthesis is highly dependent on sun-
light, factors and conditions associated with decreased
time spent outdoors can be expected to adversely impact
vitamin D status. Shiftwork represents work that occurs
outside the traditional 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. workday and may
include evening or night shift work, with or without ro-
tating shifts. An estimated 28% of working Canadians
[14], 17% of Americans [15], and 22% of European
workers [16] work outside the traditional 9 a.m. to
5 p.m., Monday through Friday schedule. Shiftwork has
been epidemiologically associated with a number of
health conditions, including sleep disturbances, cardio-
vascular disorders, gastrointestinal and digestive prob-
lems, and increased cancer risk, among others [17–19].
Little is known about the role of vitamin D deficiency
with respect to the adverse health outcomes related to
shiftwork, although vitamin D deficiency has been previ-
ously postulated as a mechanism of shiftwork-related
cancers [20]; shiftworkers can plausibly be expected to
have lower serum vitamin D levels due to reduced ex-
posure to sunlight or altered dietary intake of vitamin
D-rich foods. Additionally, other occupational groups
(e.g. indoor workers) may be at risk of vitamin D defi-
ciency through this same mechanism of reduced sunlight
exposure, and it has been previously noted that there
has been comparatively little research into the health of
indoor nonindustrial workers [21].
Understanding the levels of vitamin D and prevalence of
vitamin D deficiency in various occupational categories can
inform public health attempts to reduce vitamin D defi-
ciency and ensure improved population health outcomes.
The link between vitamin D levels and occupation has pre-
viously been explored in the published literature, and low
levels of vitamin D have been demonstrated in some occu-
pational groups with expected low exposure to sunlight.
For example, a recent study in bakers concluded that vita-
min D insufficiency was very common, especially in night
workers [22]. A large study from Korea found that the risk
of vitamin D deficiency was significantly increased for shift
work and office work [23]. An Indonesian study likewise
showed that vitamin D deficiency may occur in women
with indoor occupations [24]. In contrast, other evidence
confirms that outdoor workers have comparatively high
serum vitamin D levels [25–27]. However, the association
between occupational factors (e.g. shiftwork, indoor work,
work activities) and vitamin D levels is far from clear in the
literature, and vitamin D deficiency in working populations
does not seem to be entirely explained by sunlight expos-
ure. A Japanese study on shiftworkers comparing serum
25-(OH)D levels in fixed daytime workers to rotating
workers with or without night shift demonstrated no sig-
nificant differences [28]. Additionally, vitamin D deficiency
can be prevalent among certain groups of workers, for ex-
ample health care workers, even in regions with high sun-
shine exposure [29].
To our knowledge, there has been no previous system-
atic attempt to examine the effect of occupation on vita-
min D status, or determine the prevalence of vitamin D
deficiency in different occupational groups, despite the

 importance of work in most workers’ lives. Additionally,
we are unaware of any current guidelines on screening
for vitamin D deficiency or vitamin D supplementation,
which include specific guidance for workers, or risk
stratification elements based on occupational factors.
The present article aims to provide evidence to address
these gaps.
Methods
The objective of the present study is to investigate
serum vitamin D levels, and prevalence of insufficiency
and deficiency in different occupational categories to
identify groups of workers at particular risk of vitamin D
deficiency or insufficiency.
Study eligibility criteria
We sought observational studies describing measured
vitamin D levels or prevalence of vitamin D deficiency
or insufficiency in a working population. We included
studies where a distinct group of workers was compared
with one or more groups of other workers or non-
working individuals, and studies on students provided
they were students of a specific vocation (e.g. healthcare
students). Otherwise, we excluded studies on students.
We excluded studies performed on subjects in the mili-
tary, professional athletes, and astronauts, and studies
taking place in Antarctica, because they were deemed
less relevant to our study objective. We also excluded
trials of vitamin D supplementation in working popula-
tions. Only peer-reviewed full journal articles were in-
cluded;
we
excluded
review
articles,
abstracts
and
conference proceedings, as well as articles not published
in English or German. We included papers in which data
were derived from large population based cohort studies
in a defined occupational group (e.g. the Nurses’ Health
Study, Physicians’ Health Study, etc.). For case-control
studies, we excluded information on cases but included
information on controls, as they would arguably have
been representative of the study population and were
not defined by a disease state.
Search strategy
Electronic database searches were conducted by a health
sciences librarian (LD) in July 2015 and updated in March
2016 in Medline (including in process and other non-
indexed citations as well as Medline Daily), Embase, the
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and
CINAHL Plus with Full Text. The searches used an exten-
sive combination of keywords and subject headings for
the concepts of vitamin D and occupation to identify rele-
vant studies. Studies that only included participants who
were 18 and under or 65 and older were excluded as they
were assumed not to be about working populations. Fur-
thermore, studies where the described occupations could
not be meaningfully grouped into occupational categories
have been excluded from this review. The full version of
the electronic search strategies can be found in ‘Additional
file 1: Search strategies’. Reference lists of retrieved articles
and reviews in the field were assessed to identify add-
itional publications of relevance. Search results and full-
text articles were screened independently by two investi-
gators (XF, DS). Wherever there was a disagreement in
the selection of relevant articles between the two investi-
gators, the senior investigator (SS) made the final judge-
ment based on the established inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Assessment of study quality and data extraction
We extracted data on the study ID, number of subjects,
location/latitude, measured vitamin D levels (25-hydro-
xyvitamin D, 25-hydroxyvitamin D2, 25-hydroxyvitamin
D3, and 1α, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D) and on the preva-
lence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency. Add-
itionally, we extracted data on season of the year and the
assay type from articles where this information was
available. Where the latitude of the location of study was
not provided but the name of the city or country of
study was given, it was obtained from an online tool on
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA) website by entering the city or country name
and searching for the respective latitude [30]. The ex-
tracted data also included first author, year of publica-
tion, study type and occupational group. Data extraction
was performed by one investigator and independently
verified by a second (XF, DS). Discrepancy between the
two investigators was resolved by consulting with the se-
nior investigator (SS).
The quality of the included studies was assessed based
on previously employed criteria [12], which included the
representativeness (selection of study subjects) of the in-
dividual study report, the validity of method used to
measure vitamin D levels [31, 32], and assay reliability,
which pertains to the intra- and inter-assay coefficients
of variation of the assay. However, in the present report,
representativeness of study participants was not a major
concern since serum 25-(OH)D status was assessed in
workers of a given occupational category; therefore, we
did not include this factor in our evaluation of study
quality.
One criterion that we used to assess study quality was
whether the authors mentioned the season of the year in
which the study was conducted, as there is a seasonal vari-
ation in vitamin D levels [4] which is an important con-
founder when interpreting vitamin D levels. Additionally,
a particular study was considered valid if the assay tech-
nique to determine vitamin D levels was in keeping with
the International Vitamin D Quality Assessment Scheme
[33]. Finally, to be considered reliable, the inter-assay coef-
ficient of variation (CV) must be less than 15%, while the
Sowah et al. BMC Public Health  (2017) 17:519 
Page 3 of 25
 intra-assay CV must be below 10% [12, 33]. A study was
considered to be of high quality if all three criteria (report-
ing on seasonality, validity and reliability) were met; of
medium quality when only two of the criteria were satis-
fied; when only one criterion was met, we considered such
a study to be of low quality; and when none of our quality
criteria were met, the study was considered to be of very
low quality.
Data synthesis
The mean levels of measured vitamin D metabolites (25-
(OH)D and/or 1α, 25-(OH)2D) were extracted from in-
cluded studies for each occupational category. Studies
where metabolite levels were provided as mean ± SD/SE
(standard deviation/standard error) were included in fur-
ther analysis to compute the overall mean for the par-
ticular occupational group. To enable pooling of data
from different studies for a particular occupational
group, we also standardized the measure of spread by
converting SE to SD, where applicable, using the for-
mula, SD = SE x √ N, where N is the sample size or num-
ber of subjects.
Following conversion to SD, the pooled SD was calcu-
lated by combining the individually weighted SD based
on the formula below [34]:

n1 = sample size of group 1.

to the following formula [35]:

When averages were presented in the study as me-
dian ± interquartile ranges (IQRs), the values were con-
verted into estimated mean ± SD based on a previously
established approach [36–38]. Data were not included in
the final meta-analysis if only the median values were
provided in the absence of IQRs [39, 40] or geometric
means reported without indication of a measure of
spread [41, 42]. Whenever there were three or more
studies from an occupational group, which reported data
as mean ± SD, a meta-analysis was conducted on those
studies by pooling or combining the means and SDs
using the method for combining means and SDs as de-
scribed in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Re-
views of Interventions [43]. Based on this approach, the
overall
mean
of
each
occupational
category
was
calculated by averaging the means of individual studies
weighted by the number of subjects of each study.
All units of measurement of vitamin D concentration
were standardized to the S.I. units, nmol/L for 25-
(OH)D or pmol/L for 1α, 25-(OH)2D, by multiplying the
imperial unit (ng/ml or pg/ml, respectively) by a factor
of 2.5 or 2.4, respectively [12]. The number of studies
reporting on levels of 1α, 25-(OH)2D were too few to
permit quantitative comparison of results obtained be-
tween different occupational groups. Results were there-
fore mainly analyzed and compared relative to the
average serum levels of 25-(OH)D computed from each
occupational category. To evaluate the differences in the
prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency be-
tween different occupational groups, the proportion of
study subjects who were either deficient or insufficient
in the relevant groups were compared.
Due to the lack of consensus regarding the level of 25-
(OH)D that constitutes vitamin D deficiency, we adopted
the widely employed Endocrine Society’s (ES) cut-offs as
standard definition to compare the degree of deficiency
between different occupational groups. The ES has de-
fined vitamin deficiency as a serum 25-(OH)D concen-
tration of <20 ng/ml (<50 nmol/L), a serum level
between 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/L) and 30 ng/ml (<75 nmol/
L) as insufficiency, and a level > 30 ng/ml (>75 nmol/L)
as adequate to maintain normal physiological function
[2, 44]. However, when levels of deficiency were pro-
vided in the absence of mean 25-(OH)D level, such stud-
ies were not included in further meta-analysis.
We chose the weighted average of the proportions of
insufficient and deficient vitamin D status as the baseline
for comparison with specific occupational groups. We
calculated relative risk (RR) by finding the percentage in-
crease (or decrease) in proportion, compared to this
baseline with a 95% confidence interval (CI).
Statistical analysis
Data on the average serum 25-(OH)D levels of each oc-
cupational group are reported as mean ± SD. The levels
of 25-(OH)D deficiency or combined deficiency/insuffi-
ciency of each occupational group are reported as a per-
centage of the total number of subjects in the given
group. Whether the difference in means between occu-
pational categories was statistically significant, was de-
termined with the unpaired Student’s t-test. We used a
Chi-squared test to determine the significance of differ-
ences between proportions of vitamin D deficiency or
deficiency/insufficiency between occupational groups. A
p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
The Bonferroni procedure was employed to test whether
pairwise differences were statistically significant, while
retaining an overall level of significance of 5%. Data were

 extracted and analyzed in Microsoft Excel and p-values
were estimated with GraphPad software.
Results
The electronic database search generated 1991 records
after deduplication, of which 87 primary studies (all in
English) were considered potentially relevant, based on
title and abstract screening, and available as full text
journal articles. An additional 17 articles were identified
by searching reference lists of previously identified arti-
cles or reviews. Of this total of 104 articles, 33 were ul-
timately excluded after review of the full-text article,
leaving 71 articles to be included for further quantitative
analysis as shown in ‘Additional file 2: Study selection’.
The total number of subjects for all included studies was
at least 53,345 (one study did not report on the number
of subjects) and the sample sizes ranged from 4 to
10,646 subjects per study as shown in Table 1. The over-
all proportion of participants who were women was
65%. Publication dates ranged from 1971 to 2016. Based
on the latitudes of study locations, the included studies
spanned a range of latitudes from 3° N (Indonesia) to
64° N (Reykjavik, Iceland) in the Northern hemisphere,
and 23° S (Sao Paulo, Brazil) to 30° S (Porto Alegre,
Brazil)
in
the
Southern
hemisphere
(Table
1
and
Additional file 3: Figure S4A).
Thirty-five of 71 articles described studies performed
in health care workers (physicians, nurses, hospital em-
ployees, health sciences or medical students, and other
health professionals). Three studies were performed in
coal miners, 5 in lead/smelter workers and 6 in shiftwor-
kers. Eleven of the 71 papers described groups of out-
door workers; 19 studies were performed in indoor or
office-based workers. Some of the primary studies in-
cluded subjects of more than one occupational setting
and such studies were categorized under more than one
occupational group depending on the occupations de-
scribed by the authors, as shown in Table 1. Each occu-
pational category that we examined had 3 or more
primary studies, therefore permitting further quantitative
analysis. Studies in which we could not establish a well-
defined occupational setting were excluded (Table 1).
We extracted data from the included studies based on
season of the year in which the study was conducted,
assay type (measure of validity) and intra- and inter-
assay CV (indication of reliability) in order to assess
study quality; ‘unknown’ indicates that a study did not
describe the parameter in question (Table 2). As shown
in Table 2, 43% of included studies were of high quality,
37% were of medium quality, and 20% were of low qual-
ity. Regarding assay types, 40% of reports employed a
radioimmunoassay (RIA) technique to assess serum vita-
min D levels, 14% used a competitive protein binding
assay,
a
chemiluminescence
assay
technique
was
employed in 13% of studies, 11% assayed vitamin D
levels via the high performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) assay, while 4%, 2% and 1%, respectively,
employed
the
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
(ELISA),
liquid
chromatography
and
radioceptor
techniques.
Indoor/office and outdoor workers
We compared vitamin D level and the proportion of
workers with deficiency/insufficiency between indoor
and outdoor workers. As shown in Fig. 1 (and Add-
itional file 4: Figure S1), the mean vitamin D level was
significantly lower in indoor/office workers compared to
outdoor
workers
(40.6
±
13.2
nmol/L
vs.
66.6 ± 16.7 nmol/L; p < 0.0001). Figure 2 demonstrates
that 78% of indoor workers were vitamin D deficient in
contrast to only 48% of outdoor workers who were vita-
min D deficient. There was also a statistically significant
difference between indoor and outdoor workers in the
proportion who were vitamin D deficient or insufficient:
91% of indoor workers had vitamin D levels below
75 nmol/L versus 75% of outdoor workers (p < 0.01)
(Fig. 2). Indoor workers had significantly elevated RRs of
1.23 (95% CI: 1.22 to 1.24) and 1.24 (95% CI: 1.22 to
1.25), to develop vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency,
respectively (Tables 3 and 4). Outdoor workers had a
significantly reduced susceptibility to vitamin D defi-
ciency (RR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.75 to 0.79) but no signifi-
cantly different risk to develop vitamin D insufficiency
(RR: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.98 to 1.07) (Tables 3 and 4).
To determine the effect of latitude on vitamin D status
and
deficiency,
the
latitudes
of
the
various
study
locations were obtained and plotted against mean vita-
min D levels, % deficiency and % non-vitamin D suffi-
cient (e.g. deficient or insufficient). On average, at any
given latitude, the mean vitamin D levels of outdoor
workers were higher than values seen in indoor workers
(Additional file 3: Figure S4B). In general, a higher
proportion of indoor workers were vitamin D defi-
cient compared to outdoor workers (Additional file 5:
Figure S5B). That vitamin D deficiency or insuffi-
ciency was higher in indoor workers relative to out-
door workers was not dependent on study location
(Additional file 6: Figure S6B).
Shiftworkers
Our analysis demonstrated that the impact of shiftwork
on vitamin D status was considerable. Of all the occupa-
tional categories that were studied, shiftworkers had the
lowest
average
levels
of
serum
vitamin
D
(33.8 ± 10.1 nmol/L) (Fig. 1). About 80% of shiftworkers
had serum vitamin D levels ≤50 nmol/L, indicating vita-
min D deficiency (Fig. 2). Of the 6 studies on shiftwor-
kers,

 insufficiency in addition to deficiency. In this one study,
which was conducted at latitude 45`30° N, about 91% of
subjects were found to be vitamin D deficient or insuffi-
cient [45] (Fig. 2). As shown in Tables 3 and 4, shiftwor-
kers had the highest risk to develop vitamin D deficiency
(RR: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.26 to 1.28) and a RR of 1.24 (95%
CI: 1.16 to 1.32) to develop vitamin D insufficiency.
Lead and smelter workers
Five studies of 183 subjects reported on lead and
smelter workers. The mean vitamin D level of lead/
smelter workers was 77.8 ± 5.4 nmol/L; they repre-
sented the occupational group with the highest vita-
min D level among all the occupational categories we
investigated (Fig. 1). None of the studies presented
data on the proportion of subjects who were either
vitamin D deficient or insufficient. All the included
studies on lead/smelter workers also measured circu-
lating levels of 1α, 25-(OH)2D, the active metabolite
of vitamin D. In a sub-analysis, we showed that the
average
level
of
1α,
25-(OH)2D
in
lead/smelter
workers was 139.73 ± 57.51 (mean ± SD) pmol/L
(Table 1).
Coalminers
There was a paucity of studies that investigated the sta-
tus of vitamin D in coalminers in the literature. Only 3
studies assessed vitamin D levels in coalminers, with an
overall total of 314 subjects. The average serum vitamin
D level in coalminers was 56.6 ± 28.4 nmol/L (Table 1).
In order to evaluate the impact of the type of mining on
vitamin D status, we further divided coalminers into
underground and surface miners. Our analysis revealed
that there was no statistically significant difference in
average vitamin D levels between underground and sur-
face miners (57.8 ± 11.7 vs. 52.4 ± 12.4 nmol/L,
p = 0.78) (Additional file 7: Figure S2). None of the three
studies analyzed reported data on the number of sub-
jects that were vitamin D deficient or insufficient.
Healthcare workers
We found that the overall mean serum 25-(OH)D level
of all healthcare workers was 61.6 ± 11.0 nmol/L (data
from 19,083 study subjects from 35 different studies).
Among healthcare workers, our analysis demonstrated
that medical residents and healthcare students have the
lowest level of circulating vitamin D (44.0 ± 8.3 nmol/L
and 45.2 ± 5.5 nmol/L, respectively) and there was no

 statistically significant difference (p = 0.9) between these
two sub-groups (Additional file 8: Figure S3). Additionally,
65% and 72% of medical residents and healthcare stu-
dents, respectively, were vitamin D deficient (Fig. 2). Ac-
cording to Tables 3 and 4, medical residents had RR of
1.04 (95% CI: 0.97 to 1.10) of vitamin D deficiency and the
RR was 1.14 for healthcare students (95% CI: 1.09 to 1.19).
With respect to vitamin D insufficiency, medical residents
had a RR of 1.20 (95% CI: 1.15 to 1.26) and the RR was
1.20 (95% CI: 1.16 to 1.23) for healthcare students.
Seven studies reported on vitamin D in practising physi-
cians, but only three studies comprising 128 subjects re-
ported 25-(OH)D levels; the mean 25-(OH)D level was
55.0 ± 5.8 nmol/L (Table 1 and Additional file 8: Figure S3).
Relative to medical residents and healthcare students, the
higher level of 25-(OH)D in practising physicians was sta-
tistically significant (p < 0.001 for the comparison against
each group). Vitamin D deficiency in practising physicians,
reported
in
four
studies
(835
subjects)
was
46%,
significantly lower than that seen in medical residents
and healthcare students (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, re-
spectively) (Fig. 2). As shown in Tables 3 and 4, prac-
tising physicians had a RR of 0.73 (95% CI: 0.68 to
0.78) and 1.30 (95% CI: 1.28 to 1.33) of vitamin D
deficiency and insufficiency, respectively.
The average serum 25-(OH)D level in 3246 nurses
from 8 studies was 63.4 ± 4.2 nmol/L (Fig. 1 and
Additional file 8: Figure S3). The difference between
mean vitamin D status in nurses compared to medical
residents, healthcare students or practising physicians,
was statistically significant (p < 0.0001 vs. both medical
students and healthcare students; p < 0.01 vs. practising
physicians; Fig. 1). Furthermore, our analysis showed
that 43% of 500 nurses were deficient in serum 25-
(OH)D (Fig 2). The proportion of nurses deficient in
vitamin D was not significantly different compared to
practising physicians (p = 0.6), but differed significantly
when compared with medical residents and healthcare
students (p < 0.001 and p = 0.02, respectively; Fig. 2).
Nurses had a RR of 0.68 (95% CI: 0.61 to 0.75) to de-
velop vitamin D deficiency and a RR of 1.26 (95% CI:
1.22 to 1.29) of insufficiency (Tables 3 and 4).
The final sub-division of the healthcare category was the
group of employees we termed ‘other healthcare em-
ployees’
, which comprised all employees in healthcare who
were not specifically identified as nurses, physicians, med-
ical residents or healthcare students. Eleven studies of
14,236 subjects reported on vitamin D level in this group
of
workers
and
the
average
vitamin
D
level
was
63.0 ± 11.0 nmol/L, similar to values obtained in nurses,
as described above. Similar to nurses, 43% of the other
healthcare employees group were vitamin D deficient (Fig

Fig. 2 Percent vitamin D status in different occupational groups.
Vitamin D deficiency (white bars) was defined according to the
Endocrine Society’s (ES) categorization as a serum level of 25-
(OH)D ≤ 50 nmol/L (20 ng/ml). Each white bar graph represents %
of subjects of each group with a serum 25-(OH)D ≤ 50 nmol/L. The
black bars represent percent vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency in
different occupational groups. Vitamin D insufficiency was defined
based on the ES’s criteria, which indicates a serum level of 25-
(OH)D ≤ 75 nmol/L (30 ng/ml) as insufficient. Each black bar graph
represents the % of subjects of each group with a serum 25-(OH)D
level ≤ 75 nmol/L. The numbers within the bars, N, represent the
total number of subjects contributing to each category for whom
vitamin D deficiency, insufficiency, or sufficiency could
be determined

 2). Other healthcare workers had a RR of 0.69 (95% CI:
0.68 to 0.71) of vitamin D deficiency and a RR of 0.93
(95% CI: 0.91 to 0.94) for vitamin D insufficiency (Tables
3 and 4). The vitamin D level and proportion with defi-
ciency in the ‘other healthcare employees’ differed signifi-
cantly when compared with either medical residents
(p < 0.0001), healthcare students (p < 0.0001) or practising
physicians (p < 0.001), but not nurses (p = 0.9). Geograph-
ical latitude did not affect vitamin D levels and prevalence
of deficiency or insufficiency among healthcare profes-
sionals (Additional file 3: Figure S4C; Additional file 5:
Figure S5C; Additional file 6: Figure S6C).
Most of the studies did not provide data on the season
of the year in which the studies were conducted; thus,
we could not perform a quantitative analysis on the sea-
sonal effect on vitamin D levels across the various occu-
pational categories. However, enough studies on indoor
and outdoor workers reported on the seasonal effect on
vitamin D levels to enable us to conduct quantitative
comparisons between these two groups. As shown in
Fig. 3, regardless of the season, the mean level of 25-
(OH)D in outdoor workers was different compared to
indoor workers. Among outdoor workers the level of
vitamin D was lowest in the spring (57.7 ± 6.2 nmol/L)
compared to the winter (74.6 ± 9.0 nmol/L), the summer
(70.5 ± 6.9 nmol/L) and the autumn (72.6 ± 13.3 nmol/
L). Additionally, the 25-(OH)D levels in summer and au-
tumn in outdoor workers were significantly different
from levels found in winter (p < 0.0001) and spring
(p < 0.0001). Surprisingly, values in the winter were
comparable to the summer and autumn values in out-
door workers. In indoor workers, the highest value of
vitamin
D
was
observed
in
the
summer
(65.8 ± 10.3 nmol/L) and the lowest in the spring
(41.8 ± 7.4 nmol/L) and winter (44.3 ± 11.6 nmol/L).
When compared to autumn values (53.5 ± 11.8 nmol/L),

 the level of summertime vitamin D among indoor
workers were significantly different (p < 0.0001).
General observations on the studies
In general, serum 25-(OH)D levels in all occupational
groups examined were below the optimal level as recom-
mended by the ES, with the exception of lead/smelter
workers. Lead/smelter workers had the highest level of
serum vitamin D (77.8 ± 5.4 nmol/L) (Fig. 1) and were
the only group whose average level was in the sufficient
range. The average levels of vitamin D in outdoor
workers, coalminers, practising physicians, nurses and
other healthcare employees were in the insufficient
range (25-(OH)D of 50–75 nmol/L) (Fig. 1). In indoor
workers, shiftworkers, medical residents and healthcare
students the average 25-(OH)D levels were in the defi-
cient range (≤ 50 nmol/L). Average vitamin D levels
were lowest (33.8 ± 10.1 nmol/L) among shiftworkers
(Fig. 1 and Table 1).
When the various occupational groups were analysed
with regard to the percentage with vitamin D deficiency,
80% of shiftworkers were vitamin D deficient and this
group demonstrated the largest proportion of subjects in
the deficient range (Fig. 2). They were followed closely
by indoor workers and healthcare students with 77% and
72% vitamin D deficiency, respectively. Overall, outdoor
workers, practising physicians, nurses and other health-
care employees all had proportions with vitamin D defi-
ciency below 50% (Fig. 2).
The two occupational groups with the lowest propor-
tion of combined deficiency or insufficiency were out-
door workers and other healthcare employees (75% and
68%, respectively) (Fig. 2). For practising physicians,
about 96% were vitamin D deficient or insufficient. Like-
wise, indoor workers, shiftworkers and nurses all had
about 90% deficiency or insufficiency.
The average serum vitamin D levels and prevalence of
vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency (Additional file 3:
Figure S4A; Additional file 5: Figure S5A; Additional file 6:
Figure S6A) were not dependent on geographical location.
Discussion
The global prevalence of vitamin D deficiency has reached
an alarming proportion. This trend has elicited a signifi-
cant amount of research interest to elucidate the potential
causes of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency in order
to advance interventional strategies to ameliorate the as-
sociated risks [2, 46]. Several studies have demonstrated
that populations worldwide, including those located in
sunny regions of the world, are at risk of vitamin D defi-
ciency [47, 48]. Some vulnerable demographic groups of
the population, including pregnant women [49, 50],
the
elderly
[51],
hospitalized
patients
and
other
institutionalized
groups
[12,
52,
53],
and
certain
occupations [45, 54–56] who are predisposed to receive
low or no exposure to sunshine, may be at a greater risk
of developing vitamin D inadequacy.
In general, we found that vitamin D levels in most occu-
pational groups fell well below the levels considered opti-
mal for health [13, 57]. Additionally, we observed a higher
prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in all occupational
groups examined than the reported population burden of
vitamin D deficiency in multiple populations, suggesting
that workers may be particularly vulnerable to vitamin D
deficiency [23, 41]. For instance, 25-(OH)D among US
subpopulations demonstrated that adult women had mean
serum 25-(OH)D levels of 62 nmol/L and 75 nmol/L, re-
spectively, in winter and summer [58]. Adult men had
mean serum 25-(OH)D of 70 nmol/L and 82 nmol/L in
winter and summer, respectively [58]. In contrast, Platz et
al. [59] reported that among healthcare professionals in
the US, the mean serum 25-(OH)D was 46 nmol/L. The
prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 30% [60] in the
adult population in the US compared to 38% among med-
ical residents [61, 62]. Other determinants of vitamin D
deficiency include culture [63], geography [64, 65], genet-
ics [66], disease states [67], diet [6] and age [68], and such
other determinants will have to be considered alongside
occupation as part of a comprehensive assessment of vita-
min D status.
Among the occupations considered in the present
study, indoor workers and shiftworkers demonstrated
very low levels of serum 25-(OH)D and high rates of
vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency. The relative
risks of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency in
these two worker groups were also very high com-
pared to the other worker groups. Indoor workers
spend a high proportion of their working hours in-
doors without sunshine exposure. Additionally, indoor
workers working conventional working hours would
be expected to get their sunlight exposure during
mornings and evenings, when sunlight intensity is
relatively low. Since vitamin D is produced through
sunshine
and
adequate
UV
exposure,
sunlight
deprivation
in
indoor
workers
may
put
them
at
greater risk of developing vitamin D deficiency and
its accompanying health risks. Consistent with this as-
sumption, our study showed that workers in an in-
door setting displayed a lower level of vitamin D
relative to their outdoor counterparts. Further, med-
ical residents and healthcare students, who spend a
considerable amount of time indoors, had vitamin D
levels almost identical to the level of vitamin D ob-
served in specified indoor workers (Fig. 1).
Our study also demonstrated that shiftworkers are at
the highest risk of vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency
when compared with other occupational groups. Shiftwor-
kers make up about 20% of the workforce in developed
Sowah et al. BMC Public Health  (2017) 17:519

 countries [69]. Shift work may include rotational daytime
shifts or overnight shifts. Kimlin and Tenkate [70] re-
ported that workers with permanent night shifts receive
less exposure to daytime solar UVB. This may result in a
lower vitamin D level in shiftworkers relative to the gen-
eral population. Additionally, shiftworkers with low sun-
light exposure may depend on exogenous vitamin D for
proportionately more of their total vitamin D require-
ments. These hypotheses are consistent with the findings
of the present review, which revealed that shiftworkers
had a low vitamin D level with a comparatively large pro-
portion of workers with deficiency or insufficiency. The
low level of serum 25-(OH)D seen in shiftworkers has
been suggested to be associated with their predisposition
to various diseases including cancers [71], musculoskeletal
disorders, and cardiovascular disease [2, 72, 73].
The interpretation of our analysis is complicated by
the fact that shiftworkers may work at various times
of the day in a fixed or rotating pattern. Additionally,
shiftworkers may have a greater proportion of their
nonworking hours during daylight periods, and spend
more time outdoors during nonworking days than in-
door office workers. Another factor is that shiftwor-
kers may be outdoor or indoor workers. Furthermore,
shiftworkers may differ in dietary intake, use of vita-
min D supplements, or other lifestyle factors from
non-shiftworkers,
and
considerable
variability
may
exist with regard to the amount of time spent out-
doors. Nevertheless, a compelling finding from the
present review is that shiftwork appears to be a
strong predictor for vitamin D deficiency.
Another determining factor shown to impact vita-
min D status in shiftworkers is the season during
which vitamin D levels are measured. Ito et al. [28]
demonstrated that, during the summer, the amount of
ambient solar UVB can compensate for time confined
working indoors in shiftworkers. However, in the win-
ter, vitamin D levels were lower in shiftworkers who
work fixed night shifts compared to the shiftworkers
who work strictly daytime shifts. This finding was
confirmed by Romano et al. [45], who showed that
nighttime shiftworkers had lower vitamin D levels
compared with daytime workers during spring. Taken
together, these observations suggest that, although
shiftworkers may be at greatest risk of vitamin D de-
ficiency, spending sufficient time outside and obtain-
ing
sufficient
UV
exposure
has
the
potential
of
alleviating this risk.
The lifestyle and nature of work of many healthcare
professionals may suggest less opportunity to be exposed
to daytime solar UVB. Thus, it is reasonable to assume
that healthcare employees would be at risk of vitamin D
deficiency. Additionally, working hours may be particu-
larly long during the early training period for most
healthcare professionals, where sun deprivation due to
long working hours can be exacerbated by additional
time spent indoors studying. Consistently, average vita-
min D levels in healthcare students and medical resi-
dents were shown in the present review to be in the
deficient range, and average serum vitamin D levels were
significantly lower than those of practicing physicians,
nurses, or other healthcare professionals. Indeed, the
average serum vitamin D levels in medical residents and
healthcare students were close to those of specified in-
door workers. For healthcare professionals, our study re-
vealed a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among
healthcare students and medical residents. This is alarm-
ing, as students and residents are generally young adults,
and vitamin D deficiency during early adulthood may
decrease peak bone density and lead to an increased risk
of osteopenia or osteoporosis in later life, as well as
other long-term health impacts associated with subopti-
mal vitamin D status [74]. Additionally, vitamin D suffi-
ciency in young healthcare professionals may be a
surrogate marker for other healthy behaviours (e.g. out-
door exercise and good nutrition), and a high burden of
vitamin D deficiency in trainees in the health disciplines
should prompt enhanced educational measures on the
importance of adequate vitamin D, as well as an examin-
ation of the underlying training-related factors which
may contribute to vitamin D deficiency.
Practising physicians, nurses and other healthcare
workers had average serum vitamin D levels significantly
higher than students and residents, although the average
vitamin D levels in all three groups were still in the in-
sufficient range. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency
or insufficiency was also very high among all healthcare
professionals with the exception of the other healthcare
employee group. The latter group comprised employees
with diverse work environments and lifestyles, which
suggests that some may have more exposure to solar
UVB not considered typical of many healthcare profes-
sionals. This could account for the relatively low preva-
lence of vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency in the
other healthcare employees group.
The large proportion of studies on healthcare workers
may in part reflect the use of healthcare workers as a
convenience sample of young, presumed healthy individ-
uals. Additionally, several large population-based studies
in health professionals (e.g. Nurses’ Health Study, Physi-
cians’ Health Study) have been performed, and publica-
tions arising out of these cohorts are included in our
analysis. However, it is concerning that among health-
care workers, such a high prevalence of vitamin D defi-
ciency exists. This may reflect a number of occupational
factors including long working hours mainly indoors
[61, 62], shiftwork and a tendency for healthcare workers
to neglect their own health [29, 75, 76]. The extent to
Sowah et al. BMC Public Health  (2017) 17:519 
Page 18 of 25
 which healthcare workers, in general, are aware of their
own vitamin D status is unknown, and it is conceivable
that targeted interventions aimed at identifying and
treating vitamin D deficiency in health care workers may
be beneficial. Of note, some healthcare professions (e.g.
nursing) have a high proportion of female workers of
childbearing age, and there may be ancillary health bene-
fits beyond those to healthcare workers themselves.
Surprisingly, our data also demonstrate that among
healthcare professionals, only healthcare students had an
increased risk to develop vitamin D deficiency. However,
all healthcare professionals had an elevated risk of vita-
min D insufficiency, in keeping with the 25-(OH)D
levels in these worker categories.
Lead exposure, either short- or long-term, has the po-
tential to influence the metabolism of vitamin D [77,
78]. The impact of lead on serum 1α, 25-(OH)2D levels
is attributed to the inhibitory effect of lead on cyto-
chrome P450 in the proximal tubules of the kidney,
which mediates the hydroxylation of 25-(OH)D to the
dihydroxy metabolite. In adults occupationally exposed
to lead [78], Mason et al. demonstrated increased serum
1α, 25-(OH)2D levels in lead-exposed workers compared
with a referent group who were not occupationally ex-
posed to lead. In contrast, Greenberg et al. [79] did not
demonstrate any effect of lead exposure on serum 1α,
25-(OH)2D levels.
Of all the occupational groups considered in our study,
lead/smelter workers had the highest level of circulating
25-(OH)D. The mean 1α, 25-(OH)2D levels found in lead/
smelter workers in our study was 139.73 ± 57.51 pmol/L,
consistent with the average serum 1α, 25-(OH)2D levels
found in the general population [80]. This may imply that
the lead/smelter workers did not demonstrate compro-
mised renal hydroxylase activity. The number of studies on
lead/smelter workers and the number of study participants
were, however, very few relative to the other occupational
groups examined except coalminers. Moreover, the studies
were older and the nutrition of the subjects at the time may
have been different compared to subjects in more recent
studies. Furthermore, the studies on lead/smelter workers
presented in this report also are of low quality; they did not
demonstrate any relationship between serum 25-(OH)D
levels and blood lead levels. Thus, modern and high quality
studies that account for all confounders of the relationship
between lead exposure and serum 25-(OHD) and 1α, 25-
(OH)2D levels are warranted to establish if there is an asso-
ciation between lead exposure and vitamin D status.
Likewise, the literature is lacking in high quality stud-
ies that describe the relationship between coalminers
and serum vitamin D levels. Our review found only
three reports [81–83] comprising 314 subjects. Coalmi-
ners can be underground miners or surface miners.
Underground miners experience reduced exposure to
sunlight and, following on from the previous discussion,
may be at increased risk of low vitamin D status com-
pared to surface miners. Surprisingly, our findings re-
vealed that vitamin D status in underground miners was
not significantly different from surface miners. The lack
of appreciable difference in these two group of miners
may mean that exposure of the underground group to
sunlight in-between shifts could be sufficient to maintain
serum vitamin D levels. In keeping with this view, Shus-
ter et al. [81, 82] showed that, in the summer and winter
seasons, serum vitamin D levels were not significantly
different between underground and surface workers.
However, in the summer months, serum vitamin D
levels were higher than the corresponding levels seen
during the winter months. These findings were in agree-
ment with those demonstrated by Sarikaya et al. [83] in
underground and surface miners.
The angle at which the sun rays impact the skin, which
is a function of latitude, determines the amount of vita-
min D production [64]. The more oblique the angle, the
lesser the amount of vitamin D synthesized [84]. At lati-
tudes beyond 35°, vitamin D production declines [65].
However, geography did not seem to be an obvious de-
terminant of the difference in vitamin D level, as evi-
denced in the apparent lack of impact of latitude on
vitamin D levels (Additional file 3: Figure S4A-C), and
this is consistent with other published literature. A re-
cent study in the US demonstrated that, for a large pro-
portion of the year (March – October), serum vitamin D
status was independent of geographical latitude [64].
This study further described that latitude becomes limit-
ing only during the winter months (November – Febru-
ary). In our review, indoor vs. outdoor work and the
amount of time exposed to sunlight seemed to be the
dominant determinant of vitamin D levels.
Serum 25-(OH)D levels vary widely according to the
season of the year in which the studies or collection of
samples are conducted [25, 85], thus establishing season
of the year as a confounder of serum vitamin D level
[84]. Several lines of evidence suggest that there is a high
variability in seasonal vitamin D levels across the globe
[86, 87]. In a study on a normal Japanese population
(adults without any abnormal biochemical data shown
on routine medical check-up; in particular, those not
suffering from parathyroid or calcium-related diseases,
based on biochemical measurements and clinical assess-
ment), Ono et al. [88] showed that mean serum 25-
(OH)D levels were lowest in winter and spring, and
peaked in the summer and the beginning of autumn.
These findings were consistent with data from healthy
postmenopausal women in New Zealand presented by
Bolland et al. [89]. Accordingly, vitamin D deficiency
was more prevalent in the spring and winter relative to
the level of deficiency seen in summer and autumn [64].
Sowah et al. BMC Public Health  (2017) 17:519 
Page 19 of 25
 These findings confirm the dependence of vitamin D
status on season. Devgun et al. [85] also demonstrated
in both indoor and outdoor workers that serum 25-
(OH)D levels varied significantly according to season,
being lowest in the spring and winter, and highest in the
late summer and the beginning of autumn, in agreement
with previous data [88, 89]. More importantly, they
showed that vitamin D levels in outdoor workers were
higher relative to indoor workers for all seasons but
more pronounced in early winter.
In this systematic review, we could not perform a
meta-analysis on all occupational groups to determine
the effect of seasonality on vitamin D status because
most of the included studies did not report on the
season in which serum vitamin D level was assessed.
We suggest that seasonality should be routinely re-
ported in future studies on vitamin D levels to try to
address this gap. Nonetheless, from the included stud-
ies which reported on seasons in indoor and outdoor
workers, our data showed that vitamin D levels in
outdoor
workers
were
higher
relative
to
indoor
workers in all four seasons (Fig. 3). An unexpected
finding in the present study was that the level of 25-
(OH)D in the winter was comparable to the summer
and autumn values in outdoor workers. Endogenous
vitamin D synthesis is a function of UV radiation in
the wavelength range of 280–320 nm, which in turn
depends on season and latitude [64, 65, 85, 90]. At
high latitudes (>35° N) UV radiation becomes almost
negligible in the winter months, which consequently
affects vitamin D production [85]. In contrast, at
lower latitudes, UV radiation is not limiting during
the winter months, which suggests that vitamin D
synthesis can proceed all year long [64]. An alterna-
tive explanation may be that it is possible to accumu-
late sufficient vitamin D stores to get through the
winter, but that the stores are depleted by springtime.
Therefore, the lowest levels are seen in spring.
In the present study, the location of the studies that
contributed the highest amount to the pooled mean 25-
(OH)D level in outdoor workers in the winter were at
latitudes <35° N [91]. Thus, outdoor workers in these re-
gions may not experience huge seasonal variation in
vitamin D synthesis compared to indoor workers. To-
gether with the fact that there were few studies that con-
tributed
to
the
analysis
of
serum
25-(OH)D level
dependence on season, this could account for the rela-
tively high level of 25-(OH)D in outdoor workers during
the winter season.
Most adults in the general population globally have
vitamin D inadequacy [13, 46]. A significant proportion
of the adult population in Europe, the US and Canada
have vitamin D deficiency [2, 92]. Despite the relation-
ship between sunlight exposure and vitamin D levels,
vitamin D deficiency is reportedly also prevalent among
populations living in sunny climates including the Mid-
dle East, Africa, Australia, India and South America [2,
93, 94]. Population-level prevalences of vitamin D defi-
ciency have been reported as 59% in the Canadian popu-
lation [95], 52% in the Danish population [96], and 40%
in the US population [97, 98]. Our systematic review
suggests that occupation is a major determinant that
may contribute to suboptimal vitamin D levels and that
workers in some occupations have lower average levels
of vitamin D and a higher prevalence of deficiency com-
pared to the general public. Indoor workers, shiftwor-
kers, medical residents, healthcare students, practising
physicians and coalminers have a particularly high
prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. However, most occu-
pational groups considered in this review, with the ex-
ception of lead/smelter workers, had a moderate to high
burden of vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency.
Clinical Implications and Recommendations
Although population-wide vitamin D deficiency is a glo-
bal phenomenon, from the present systematic review it
is clear that workers in some occupational categories are
at a greater risk for vitamin D deficiency than others.
Regular screening for vitamin D levels in shiftworkers
and other specific groups of workers should be consid-
ered for future clinical practice guidelines and popula-
tion health initiatives, while existing workplace wellness
programs should incorporate education about the im-
portance of adequate vitamin D levels, sunlight exposure
and adequate nutritional intake of vitamin D-rich foods
to prevent adverse health outcomes related to vitamin D
deficiency. Additionally, for occupations predominantly
based indoors, workers could, where appropriate, be en-
couraged to take intermittent breaks outside to expose
the skin to UV light in order to promote cutaneous vita-
min D synthesis [99, 100], and work schedules could be
re-imagined to allow for such breaks, while of course
avoiding excessive sunlight exposure.
Limitations
To further the aim of a robust body of literature on the
health effects of suboptimal vitamin D status, the aca-
demic community would benefit from a consensus as to
what constitutes vitamin D deficiency. Due to an existing
lack of agreement on the definition of vitamin D defi-
ciency, combining data from studies where the study au-
thors have used different definitions of adequate vitamin
D status is challenging. In the present study, we used the
ES’s definition of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency.
Other
approaches,
such
as
using
the
Institute
of
Medicine’s definitions, could also be justified. Agreement
on what constitutes vitamin D insufficiency and defi-
ciency
will
additionally
enhance
standardization

 guidelines and interventional efforts targeted at at-risk
occupational groups in the population.
Another limitation is the methodology employed in
assaying serum vitamin D levels. In the present review, the
majority of the included studies used the RIA technique
to evaluate vitamin D status. Several lines of evidence have
shown that there is a marked inter-laboratory variation in
results obtained with this assay type, which could be as
high as 30% [8, 13]. These variations need to be borne in
mind when pooling data from different studies.
Serum vitamin D level is determined by latitude (geo-
graphical location), season (UVB), cultural traditions (cloth-
ing), diet and sex. The present review combines studies
conducted at different latitudes, seasons and with subjects
from diverse cultural backgrounds. This has the potential
to overestimate or underestimate the influence of occupa-
tion on vitamin D. These differences may also create a high
degree of heterogeneity between individual studies making
conclusions derived from pooled data less reliable.
Our systematic review is also limited with regard to oc-
cupational detail, as we relied on what was reported by
the primary study authors in their description of the sub-
jects’ occupations or occupational categories.
Recommendations for future studies
Based on the above limitations, we suggest that future
studies measuring vitamin D status employ assay tech-
niques with minimal inter-laboratory variations. One
method, which has been shown to be consistently repro-
ducible, is liquid chromatography [101]. In a review to
compare different assays used to assess vitamin D status,
it was demonstrated that liquid chromatography followed
by tandem mass spectrometry produced the lowest vari-
ability across different laboratories [6]. It is recommended
that the assay technique for the assessment of vitamin D
levels should be standardized to enable ready comparison
and meta-analysis.
Though medical students and residents may still be con-
sidered as a convenience sample, future studies employing
this group as subjects should not presume that they are
necessarily a population of “healthy” young adults.
Since season of the year is a major determinant of
vitamin D levels, future studies should comment on the
season in which the study is performed.
Future studies should also incorporate additional con-
founders such as measures of sunlight exposure and diet.
Studies on shiftworkers should furthermore provide an
indication of the type of shiftwork performed.
Conclusions
Individuals who work predominantly indoors and shift-
workers are at risk of developing vitamin deficiency or
insufficiency. Despite a lack of consensus on optimal
levels of vitamin D for health, vitamin D insufficiency
and deficiency are common in the occupational groups
investigated, and some workers should be considered an
at-risk group for vitamin D deficiency. Further high
quality studies are needed to explore the relationship be-
tween occupation and vitamin D status. The assumption
that trainees in the health care disciplines represent a
convenience sample of “healthy” adults may not always
be true. Guidelines on screening for vitamin D defi-
ciency and supplementation strategies in vulnerable
groups should include consideration of occupation.
