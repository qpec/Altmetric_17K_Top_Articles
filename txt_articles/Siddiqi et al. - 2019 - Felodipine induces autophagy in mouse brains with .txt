Neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s
disease manifest with the neuronal accumulation of toxic proteins. Since autophagy upre-
gulation enhances the clearance of such proteins and ameliorates their toxicities in animal
models, we and others have sought to re-position/re-profile existing compounds used in
humans to identify those that may induce autophagy in the brain. A key challenge with this
approach is to assess if any hits identified can induce neuronal autophagy at concentrations
that would be seen in humans taking the drug for its conventional indication. Here we report
that felodipine, an L-type calcium channel blocker and anti-hypertensive drug, induces
autophagy and clears diverse aggregate-prone, neurodegenerative disease-associated pro-
teins. Felodipine can clear mutant α-synuclein in mouse brains at plasma concentrations
similar to those that would be seen in humans taking the drug. This is associated with
neuroprotection
in
mice,
suggesting
the
promise
of
this
compound
for
use
in
neurodegeneration.

1234567890():,;
 A
common feature of most neurodegenerative diseases,
including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Huntington’s
disease (HD) is the accumulation of aggregate-prone
proteins within the cytoplasm of neurons. Such proteins, like
mutant huntingtin (HD), α-synuclein (Parkinson’s disease) and
tau (in various dementias), cause pathology via toxic gain-of-
function mechanisms. Thus, the factors regulating their clearance
are likely to be important for understanding pathogenesis and
developing rational therapeutic strategies.
Autophagy, a major intracytoplasmic protein degradation
pathway, is mediated by double-membraned structures, which
engulf portions of cytoplasm. Autophagosomes ultimately fuse
with lysosomes, where their contents are degraded. Autophagy is
critical for the degradation of diverse intracytoplasmic aggregate-
prone proteins that cause neurodegenerative diseases, including
huntingtin, mutant α-synuclein, and tau1–4 and impairing
autophagy causes the accumulation of such proteins and
enhances their toxicities. Autophagy upregulation using com-
pounds or genetic means enhances the clearance of such proteins
and thereby attenuates the deleterious phenotypes seen in Dro-
sophila, zebrafish and mouse models of these diseases5. Hence, we
and others have screened existing drugs approved for other
indications to identify autophagy inducers that may be suitable
for treating neurodegenerative diseases. While these efforts have
identified a number of existing drugs as autophagy inducers, the
animal studies using such repurposed drugs have not tested
whether any benefits that they may have are achievable with
concentrations of the compounds that exist in people taking these
compounds. This issue is critical, as drugs typically have much
shorter half-lives in mice compared to humans, and the con-
centrations that the drugs may reach (albeit transiently) in mouse
studies may be orders of magnitude higher than those seen with
human dosing, which aims for prolonged and stable levels. Thus,
it is possible that the effects of any such compounds seen in mice
may not be achievable in humans, as the benefits may be due to
on-target or off-target drug effects at concentrations much higher
than those seen in humans. This scenario would make the drugs
unsuitable for direct repurposing.
Previously, from a screen of a library enriched in approved
drugs, we identified verapamil, an L-type calcium channel
blocker, as an inducer of autophagosome formation and validated
that L-type calcium channels are an mTOR-independent autop-
hagy target using numerous tools6. Verapamil enhanced the
clearance
of
Parkinson’s
disease-causing
A53T
mutant
α-
synuclein in cell lines and reduced the percentages of cells with
aggregates of mutant huntingtin exon 1 in autophagy-competent
but not in autophagy-null cells. Furthermore, verapamil rescued
mutant huntingtin toxicity in Drosophila and zebrafish models of
Huntington’s disease, where it also reduced huntingtin aggregate
numbers. L-type calcium channel blockers are anti-hypertensive
drugs and are widely used in man for long-term therapeutic
treatment. Therefore, this family of drugs would be suitable for
re-purposing for long-term treatment for neurodegenerative
disorders. However, verapamil does not cross the blood–brain
barrier (BBB) and is therefore not suitable to this end. Hence, we
screened a panel of currently prescribed L-type calcium channel
blockers to identify a BBB-penetrant member of this class that
showed strong autophagy-inducing effects and had a long half-life
in man. We selected felodipine as the most suitable candidate for
further assessment and validated its effects in in vivo models of
tauopathy, Huntington’s disease and Parkinson’s disease (A53T
α-synuclein mutation) to test whether this autophagy-inducing
drug had relevance to multiple neurodegenerative diseases. We
performed pharmacokinetic analysis to determine the optimal
treatment regime in mice to mimic the plasma concentration that
the drug reaches in man at currently prescribed doses. Finally, we
tested felodipine at this clinically-relevant concentrations.
Our data reveal that felodipine administration in mice at
concentrations approximating those seen in humans induces
autophagy and reduces levels of neurotoxic proteins, like A53T α-
synuclein. These data suggest that this drug may have efficacy in
humans with appropriate neurodegenerative diseases that may be
ameliorated by autophagy induction.
Results
Screening of calcium channel blockers in primary neurons. In
order to select the most promising of the L-type calcium
channel blockers (Table 1) for further in vivo studies, we
researched all currently prescribed FDA-approved members of
this family7 and ranked them according to BBB-penetration,
structural similarity (dihydropyridine or non-dyhydropyridine)
and known half-life in man. We selected 5 drugs and profiled
their autophagy-inducing activity in primary neurons from a
transgenic mouse model expressing mRFP-GFP-LC38. LC3 is
recruited to the membrane of forming autophagosomes and is
widely accepted to be a reliable marker of autophagic vesicles.
When LC3 is double-tagged with both GFP and a red fluor-
escent protein (e.g., mCherry or mRFP)9, one can distinguish
non-acidified autophagosomes (red and green = yellow) from
acidified autolysosomes (red only), as the GFP fluorescence is
more rapidly quenched by the low lysosomal pH10. Of the panel
of L-type calcium channel blockers tested, felodipine caused the
greatest increase on both autophagosome and autolysosome

 numbers (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1a). This was the most
sensitive measure of activity since, in mouse primary cortical
neurons, all the L-type calcium channel blockers we studied
decreased the percentage of neurons with mutant huntingtin exon
1 aggregates to similar extents, a phenomenon seen with other
known autophagy inducers, like trehalose and rapamycin (Sup-
plementary Fig. 1b). To verify the effects observed with the mRFP-
GFP-LC3 reporter, we confirmed that felodipine increased the
steady-state of endogenous LC3-II levels, as well as LC3-II for-
mation (in experiments without and with the lysosome inhibitor,
bafilomycin A1) in mouse primary neurons, demonstrating that it
increased autophagic flux (Fig. 1b, c). Based on these data and the
knowledge that felodipine crosses the BBB, we investigated felo-
dipine further.

 L-type calcium channel blockers protect zebrafish models. We
next went on to assess the in vivo efficacy of felodipine. We have
previously observed that verapamil was beneficial in our zebrafish
model of Huntington’s disease6. To confirm that L-type channel
calcium blockers can clear a range of disease-causing substrates,
we compared the efficacy of verapamil and felodipine in two
zebrafish transgenic models of tauopathy. The first model (rho::
tau) expresses wild-type human tau in the rod photoreceptors
which causes progressive degeneration and loss of these cells11.
Both verapamil and felodipine rescued the degeneration of pho-
toreceptors in these fish but failed to rescue degeneration in rho::
tau fish lacking the critical autophagy gene atg7, indicating that
the rescuing effects are autophagy-dependent (Fig. 1d, e). In the
second zebrafish model, pan-neuronal expression of the p.A152T
tau variant, associated with dementia and tau pathology in
patients12 causes tau hyperphosphorylation, tau aggregation and
neuronal loss in zebrafish, which are also seen in mouse
models13,14. Verapamil and felodipine ameliorated the morpho-
logical defects in this model (Fig. 1f), defined in supplementary
Fig. 2a. Both drugs selectively reduced the levels of insoluble tau
and caused an increase in the soluble fractions, suggesting that
the insoluble species may be preferentially removed by verapamil
or felodipine treatment (Fig. 1g, h). No significant changes in
total tau levels were observed suggesting that soluble tau may be
sequestered in the insoluble fraction in the DMSO-treated group
(Fig. 1g and Supplementary Fig. 2b, c, d, and e).
Having
determined
that
felodipine
effectively
increased
autophagic flux in primary neurons and rescued pathology
in vivo via an autophagy-dependent mechanism, we went on to
investigate the dose required in mice to induce autophagy and
clear neurodegenerative-causing toxic proteins. Intraperitoneal
administration of felodipine increased the numbers of autopha-
gosomes and autolysosomes in mRFP-GFP-LC3 transgenic
mouse brains 4 h after drug administration in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 2a, b, c). Using the same dose range, we next
performed a pilot study to determine whether and at what
concentration felodipine was able to reduce the numbers of
aggregates in Huntington’s disease transgenic mice. We used the
N171-82Q mice (hereafter called B6HD mice), which express the
first 171 amino acids of mutant huntingtin under the control of
the mouse prion promoter, which restricts expression of the
protein mainly to the brain15. The number of aggregates was
significantly reduced in the piriform and motor cortex of these
mice after 6 weeks treatment with intraperitoneal injections
(Fig. 2d, e), paralleling what we have seen in other HD models
when we induce autophagy2. These effects were dose-dependent,
with the most effective dose determined to be 5 mg/kg. On the
basis of these data, we continued to use 5 mg felodipine/kg body
weight intraperitoneal injections (i.p.) for further studies. This
dose of felodipine was effective at inducing autophagy at various
ages (6 and 12 weeks old) in mRFP-GFP-LC3 mice analysed 4 h
after injection and also in double transgenic mRFP-GFP-LC3/
B6HD mice (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b, c) where these effects were
also evident at 7.5 h after injection (Supplementary Fig. 3d).
Felodipine efficacy study in N171-82Q (B6HD) mice. Since our
data showed that i.p. injection of felodipine could reduce the
levels of mutant huntingtin, the toxic causative agent in Hun-
tington’s disease, we tested whether long-term treatment could
ameliorate signs of disease in the B6HD Huntington’s disease
mouse model15. These transgenic mice show a profound phe-
notype, including loss of motor coordination, including a marked
decline in their ability to perform rotarod, grip-strength and wire-
manoeuvre tasks, increased tremors, weight loss and premature
death from about 12 weeks of age16,17. We pre-tested male mice
at 5 weeks of age to estimate the baseline motor performances
using rotarod testing, to ensure that the randomly assigned
treatment and vehicle groups (also control wild-type littermates)
were not significantly different in their ability to perform on the
rotarod test. Felodipine treatment was then started at 6 weeks of
age. The SHIRPA battery of behavioural testing including grip
strength, wire manoeuvre and tremor monitoring was performed
at 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17 and 19 weeks of age, while rotarod testing
was performed every 4 weeks until death or euthanasia as
required as a humane endpoint. All data of mice which were alive
at these time-points were included in the analysis.
Felodipine-treated B6HD mice displayed significant improved
in grip strength from 11 to 19 weeks of age (Fig. 3a,
Supplementary Table 1). There was no influence of felodipine
treatment on the performance of wild-type mice. The severity of
tremors was significantly improved in felodipine-treated B6HD
mice at 17 and 19 weeks of age and a trend towards an
improvement was also seen at the age of 13 weeks (Fig. 3b,
Supplementary Table 2). Wild-type mice do not demonstrate
tremors at any age, also felodipine treatment did not induce
tremors in the wild-type mice. The wire manoeuvre tests the
muscle coordination and endurance of mice and has been
adopted as part of the comprehensive SHIRPA phenotypic testing
regimen18. It tests the capacity of mice to climb back on a
horizontal wire when hung on the wire by their forelimbs.
Felodipine-treated B6HD mice performed significantly better on
the wire manoeuvre task at 17 and 19 weeks of age (Fig. 3c,
Supplementary Table 3). There was no influence of felodipine
treatment on the performance of wild-type mice. The accelerated
rotarod apparatus is a measure of motor coordination and
measures the ability of a mouse to maintain balance on a rotating
cylinder (rotating towards the mouse). At 14 weeks of age, there
was a trend towards an improved performance of the felodipine-
treated B6HD animals. At 18 weeks of age, felodipine-treated
B6HD mice stayed significantly longer on the rotarod than the

 vehicle-treated HD mice (Fig. 3d, Supplementary Table 4). Thus,
felodipine improved the motor phenotype in B6HD mice in all
the tests we have performed. Felodipine ameliorated the weight
loss of the B6HD mice from 19 weeks but had no effects on
weight of wild-type mice (Supplementary Fig. 4a, Supplementary
Table 5). It was necessary to cull some mice by euthanasia at
different time-points during the study due to adverse events e.g.,
due to swollen abdomen or abscesses after i.p. injections.
Adverse events were observed in all groups irrespective of the
genotype and drug treatment (Supplementary Table 6). This
precluded meaningful assessment of effects on disease-associated
life-span.

 Felodipine pharmacokinetics. Felodipine is an FDA-approved
antihypertensive drug with a recommended dosing profile of 2.5
mg–20 mg/day19. We selected felodipine as the best candidate
drug from a panel of L-type calcium channel blockers based on
BBB-penetration and long half-life in man and therefore we
predicted it would likely provide long-term upregulation of
autophagy. However, we do not know how the pharmacokinetics
in mice compare with those in man. In humans taking felodipine
as an antihypertensive drug (10 mg daily dose), the peak plasma
concentration in males is 28 nmol/L and is 33 nmol/L in females
Fig. 2 Felodipine in vivo dose-response experiments. a–c mRFP-GFP-LC3 transgenic mice (males and females, 6–7 weeks old) were injected i.p. with
various doses of felodipine (1, 2, 5, 10 mg/kg body weight). a, b Treatment with 5 and 10 mg felodipine resulted in a statistically significant increase in
autolysosomes and total vesicle number in the cerebral cortex with a similar trend observed in Purkinje cells. Autophagosome and autolysosome numbers
are shown as mean +/− SEM; mean values of each vesicle type (autophagosome, autolysosome or total vesicles) for each dose of felodipine were
compared with the mean value of same vesicle type to those in vehicle controls using one-sample, one-tailed unpaired t-test. Data shown was from 7 litters
collected at different time-points (i.e., independent experiments), all values were normalised to mean autolysosome levels in the vehicle controls.

female mice. Mice were injected i.p. three times a week with 1, 2 or 5 mg/kg body weight of felodipine or vehicle control. Felodipine treatment resulted in a
significant decrease in aggregates in the motor cortex (at 5 mg) and piriform cortex (2 and 5 mg). d Representative images of neuronal inclusions in

Fig. 3 Efficacy study of felodipine in N171-82Q (B6HD) mice. B6HD male mice were given i.p. injections of 5 mg/kg felodipine or carrier substance (vehicle
control) three times a week from 6 weeks of age. Wild-type mice littermates were also given felodipine or vehicle control injections with the same
frequency. n = 22 mice for B6HD mice for both felodipine and vehicle control groups, while n = 11 for wild-type felodipine-treated littermates and n = 12 for
wild-type vehicle-treated littermates. a Felodipine improved grip strength in B6HD mice. All B6HD mice showed some age dependent decline in grip
strength compared to wild-type littermates regardless of treatment. However, felodipine significantly improved the decline in grip strength in B6HD mice
relative to vehicle-treated B6HD mice at the time-points indicated. Data are shown as mean values +/− SEM; one-way ANOVA with post hoc Fisher’s LSD
test; exact p values for B6HD-felodipine vs. B6HD-vehicle control are shown. Felodipine treatment had no effect on grip strength in wild-type mice. b The
severity of tremors in B6HD mice was significantly improved by felodipine treatment at 17 and 19 weeks. Mann-Whitney two-tailed test was performed for
ranked data; exact p values are shown. c Felodipine treatment improved performance at the wire manoeuvre task at 17 and 19 weeks in B6HD mice. Mice
were scored on their ability to perform the wire manoeuvre task, data for the active grip with hind limbs are shown and analysed using one-way ANOVA for
non-parametric data (Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn’s multiple comparison test); exact p values for felodipine vs. vehicle control in B6HD mice are shown. d
Felodipine treatment improved rotarod performance in B6HD mice at 18 weeks. Data are presented as mean values +/− SEM; one-way ANOVA with post
hoc Fisher’s LSD test; exact p values for felodipine vs. vehicle treated B6HD mice are shown. HD-vehicle control mice had a significantly reduced
performance on the rotarod at week 10 and 14, compared to wild-type littermates (both felodipine-treated and vehicle-treated), as would be expected
based on their known disease phenotypes

 (average 30.5 nmol/L; approx. 11.7 ng/ml) in individuals aged
60–80 years-old19,20. However, how these relate to brain con-
centrations in humans is not clear from the literature and cannot
be tested in human subjects. To better understand the correlation
between plasma and brain concentration, we assessed the bioa-
vailability of the drug in the mouse brain after 5 mg/kg body
weight i.p. injection, using standard pharmacokinetic (PK)
parameters. A Cmax of 1151 ng/ml (2995.3 nmol/L) in plasma and
3500 ng/g (9108.4 nmol) in brain was achieved after 60 min of
dosing via i.p. injection. The T½ was 0.9 h (54 min) in plasma and
1.8 h (1 h 48 min) in mouse brain. This gave an AUC0-∞ (area
under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to
extrapolated infinity) of 2540 ng/ml/h (6610 nmol/L/h) in plasma
and 9330 ng/ml/h (24280.5 nmol/L/h) in brain (Table 2). We
noticed that the felodipine brain concentration is almost double
that of plasma after 15 min and is nearly three times higher in
brain after 60 min (Table 3, Fig. 4a). The felodipine brain con-
centration 8 h after a single i.p. injection was 216.4 ± 107.6 ng/g
(Table 3) and these pharmacokinetic parameters were sufficient
to induce autophagic flux in mouse brain (Supplementary Fig. 3d
shows autophagic flux increased 7.5 h after a single i.p. injection)
and also to clear mutant huntingtin aggregates (Fig. 2d, e). Since
it is not possible to test whether felodipine accumulates in the
brain in man, we next performed similar studies using minipigs.
This confirmed that felodipine accumulates in the brain, com-
pared to the plasma (Supplementary Table 7, 8, and Supple-
mentary Fig. 5a). This analysis found that more than 99% of the
felodipine was protein bound in the plasma and the brain in mice.
These studies revealed that felodipine injected intraperitoneally
in the mouse was rapidly metabolised but reached concentrations
that are orders of magnitude higher than those seen in human.
Therefore, we investigated whether we could induce autophagy in
the mouse brain using concentrations of the drug with steady
levels similar to those seen in humans. This was achieved by
implanting drug-loaded subcutaneous Alzet osmotic minipumps.
In all of these experiments, placebo-treated mice also had pumps
implanted containing vehicle only and no drug. We measured the
plasma and brain concentrations after 14 days (n = 4 mice) and
also after 28 days (n = 8 mice) (Tables 4, 5). Both experiments
further strengthened our previous observation that felodipine
concentrates in the brain and its concentration is almost the
double than that of plasma. Although there is large animal-to-
animal variability in mice for the plasma and brain concentra-
tions, we found that the average plasma concentration after
28 days was 12 ng/ml (31.22 nmol/L) which is very similar to the
peak concentrations seen in humans i.e., approx. 11.7 ng/ml (30.5
nmol/L)20. In many mice, the concentrations were higher at day 7
than at 14 days (similarly at day 10 than at day 28). The mean
brain
concentration
from
both
experiments
with
osmotic
minipumps was approx. 42 ng/g (i.e., 109.3 nmol) in mice
(Tables 4, 5).
Felodipine increases autophagic flux at low concentrations. We
were encouraged that the average plasma concentration in mice
(31 nmol/L) mimicked the human peak plasma concentration
and resulted in brain concentrations of approximately 109.3 nmol
in mice implanted with the minipumps. Therefore, to test whe-
ther these concentrations were likely to be inducing autophagy,

PK analysis was performed after single dose of 5 mg/kg body weight via i.p. injection. The PK
parameters were calculated from the mean values from 3 mice at each time-point. Hence, these
PK parameters have no SDs. SDs would not be appropriate, since the values at each time-point
are from different mice. The spread of concentrations in the mice at each time-point is given in

 we examined the effects of low concentrations (50 and 100 nM) of
felodipine in cultured primary neurons. Indeed, these con-
centrations increased the numbers of autolysosomes (suggesting
increased autophagic flux) and significantly reduced the percen-
tages of neurons with mutant huntingtin exon 1 aggregates
(Fig. 4b, c). Then, we tested if the same was observed in vivo
using osmotic minipump (Alzet Model 2004) administration of
the drug in double transgenic mRFP-GFP-LC3/B6HD mice.
When we restricted this cohort to those who had >5 ng/ml (13
nmol/L) plasma concentration (Supplementary Table 9), the
mean number of autolysosomes was increased by felodipine,
although this was not significant, likely due to the relatively low
numbers of mice studied (Fig. 4d). This administration of felo-
dipine using a minipump delivery strategy caused a significant
decrease in the huntingtin aggregation in the B6HD mice, com-
pared to that of vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 4e, f).
Felodipine improves pathology of SNCA mice. We aimed to test
if this minipump dosing protocol that enables felodipine con-
centrations similar to those seen in humans would be able to
ameliorate a disease caused by an autophagy substrate in a mouse
model. Since drug administration had to be via minipump, this
only gives us a window of 28 days to test the drug, as our Home
Office licence (from the UK authority governing animal experi-
mentation) does not permit replacing the pumps more than once
for ethical reasons. Hence, we opted to study transgenic mice
expressing the Parkinson’s disease-causing A53T mutant α-
synuclein (α-syn) protein, an autophagy substrate4 (hereafter
called SCNA mice), where pilot data had suggested that the dis-
ease shows progression over 28 days starting at 6.5 months. To
confirm that low concentrations of felodipine (100 nM), similar
to those which would be expected in the brains of humans taking
this drug, we tested whether this concentration was sufficient to
reduce α-synuclein levels in iPSC-derived human neurons that
were engineered to be homozygous for the A53T α-synuclein
mutation (Fig. 5a). Next, the SCNA mice were implanted with
subcutaneous felodipine-loaded osmotic mini pumps (ALZET
Model 2002) for 14 days, after which the pumps were replaced,
and treatment was continued for another 14 days. This replace-
ment protocol was chosen as it gives very similar concentrations
to the single pumps used above but has a faster flow rate and
more reliable drug administration. Felodipine decreased the level
of insoluble fraction of α-syn vs. GAPDH in cerebral cortex and
brain stem when compared to vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 5b, c).
The SNCA mice in this study were relatively young (7.5 months-
old; end time-point) and did not manifest obvious Lewy bodies
with aggregates. These become apparent at later ages, for example
9 to 10 months21. The reduction in mutant A53T α-synuclein was
accompanied by improved grip strength in these mice (Fig. 5d)
and increased cell numbers in the substantia nigra (Fig. 5e).
Discussion
Our data suggest that felodipine induces autophagy in neurons
and enhances removal of a range of disease-causing proteins:
mutant huntingtin, mutant α-synuclein and tau. Importantly our
zebrafish data suggest that the rescue of tau toxicity is autophagy-
dependent. A major attraction of drug repurposing is that this
strategy offers the possibility of rapid transitioning from pre-
clinical models to patients, as the toxicity and tolerability profiles
of the relevant compounds are known. However, this approach
assumes that the drug is working in its new indication via
mechanisms and concentrations similar to its original/conven-
tional application. We are not aware of any repurposing studies in
the academic literature that have addressed this issue. Our data
show that felodipine is more rapidly metabolised in mice (Tmax
60 min, T1/2 0.9 h) compared to in humans (Tmax in 2.5–5 h, and
T1/2 is 11–6 h), like many other drugs22,23. As a consequence,
intraperitoneal administration results in transient exposures of
the mice to the drug at concentrations that are more than two
orders of magnitude higher than those observed in patients taking
the drug for antihypertensive indications. This situation could
result in effects of the drug in mice that would not be seen in
humans taking conventional doses, for instance if the repurposing
mechanism required drug concentrations that were much higher
than those seen with standard dosing regimen. Such concentra-
tions would also be likely associated with increased side-effect
risks.
To circumvent this issue, we used subcutaneous minipumps to
enable concentrations of the drug in the mouse plasma that were
similar to those seen in the plasma of patients and at a steady
state rather than wildly fluctuating concentrations.
We are not aware of any data on felodipine brain concentra-
tions in humans. Accordingly, we have assessed brain/plasma
concentrations of the compound in mice under i.p. and sub-
cutaneous minipump regimes in mice and via oral dosing in
minipigs and find that felodipine concentrates in the brain, hence
we would speculate that this is likely to be the case in humans.
Our data with this minipump administration suggest that at
human-like
plasma
concentrations,
felodipine
can
induce
autophagy in the brains of mice and clear aggregate-prone dis-
ease-causing proteins. Furthermore, felodipine ameliorates signs
of disease and neurodegeneration in the A53T α-synuclein mouse
model. As our UK Home Office licence for animal experi-
mentation only permits a single replacement of the minipump,
we were restricted to studying a model that had a disease course
that had detectable decline and neurodegeneration in a one-
month period and therefore precluded testing in models of HD or
tauopathy. Felodipine is used as an antihypertensive drug, is
administered long-term, and has relatively modest side-effect
liabilities. Interestingly, epidemiological studies suggest that use
of this drug may reduce the incidence of Parkinson’s disease in
hypertensive patients24. While we are enthusiastic for it to be
tested in people with neurodegenerative diseases, or individuals
who are at risk of such conditions (e.g., presymptomatic carriers
of the Huntington’s disease mutation), its side effects and dose
will need to be considered, particularly in older patients where it
is cleared more slowly. In conclusion, we believe that this is the
first study showing that an approved drug at concentrations
similar to those seen in human patients can induce autophagy in
rodent brains, as well as the first study showing that an approved
drug under such conditions can ameliorate neurodegenerative
disease in a mouse model. These data support testing in humans
with appropriate neurodegenerative diseases. Indeed, when a drug
is safe and well tolerated, the possibility of preventive treatments
aiming to delay disease onset also becomes an option.
Methods
Isolation and culture of mouse primary cortical neurons. Wild-type neuron
cultures were generated from C57BL6 (Jackson Laboratories) embryos of E16.5
gestation. However, for primary mRFP-GFP-LC3 cortical neurons, transgenic mice
were crossed with C57BL6 mice. At E16.5 gestation, females were sacrificed and
embryos were harvested. Cortices from all embryos (regardless of genetic status)
were combined to create mixed cultures8.
Briefly, brains were harvested and placed in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution
(HBSS), the meninges were removed and the cerebral cortices were dissected. After
incubation in HBSS with 0.25% trypsin (Gibco) for 20 min at 37 °C, dissociated
neurons were resuspended in HBSS and seeded on poly-D-lysine-coated 6-
multiwell or 12-multiwell plates, or MatTek glass bottom culture dishes (P35G-1.0-
14-C). Cells were cultured in maintenance media (Neurobasal-A medium
(#12349015, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 2 mM GlutaMAX, 200
mM B27 supplement and 1% Penicillin–Streptomycin) at 37 °C in a humidified
incubator with 5% CO2. One half of the culture medium was changed every 2 days
until drug treatment or lentivral infection. After 5 days of in vitro culture,

Imaging and quantification of mRFP-GFP-LC3 primary neuron. Primary neu-
rons were treated either at DIV5 or DIV6 with 2X drug concentration in 0.5 ml
fresh media, while keeping the half of the conditioned media (0.5 ml) in the well, in
order to keep the final drug concentration correct. mRFP-GFP-LC3 neurons
treated with the indicated concentration of the drugs were live-imaged after 2 h
using confocal microscopy (63X NA 1.4 Plan Apochromat oil immersion lens; Carl
Zeiss LSM710). At least 10 fields were imaged per treatment. Images were analysed
by using Zen software. All saved images were coded by a different researcher and
subsequently analysed blind. The number of yellow vesicles dots (GFP-positive and
RFP-positive dots; autophagosomes) and red vesicles (RFP-only dots;
autolysosomes) were counted in <50 neurons per treatment group. The mean
number of autophagosomes and autolysosomes for each treatment group was
calculated. Data was normalised to mean of the control autolysosome group to
allow comparison between independent experiments. Statistical analysis was per-
formed to compare the number of autolysosomes in treatment vs. control and total
number of vesicles in treatment vs. control. A two-tailed t-test was used in the
initial screen as it was not known whether or how the drugs would affect autop-
hagy. Thereafter, one-tailed analysis was used in mRFP-GFP-LC3 vesicle counts
since there was prior demonstration of autophagy upregulation.
Transfection of wild-type primary neurons and quantification. After 5 days of

 further 24 h. Neurons were fixed in a 2% PFA plus 7.5% glucose solution and
coverslips were mounted with ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Thermo
Fisher; Invitrogen P36935). For each experiment, approximately 200 infected
neurons for each treatment group were counted blind for the presence or absence
of aggregates and the proportion of neurons with Q80 aggregates was determined.
Data was normalised to mean of the control group to allow comparison between
independent experiments. Statistical analysis was carried out using one-way
ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison for the initial screen of L-type cal-
cium channel blockers and one-tailed, unpaired t-test for subsequent felodipine
treatment experiments.
Human iPS cells. The human iPS WT line (KOLF-2) was generated by the Sanger
Wellcome Institute Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Initiative (HipsSci). Further
information, including the Certificate of Analysis, can be found on the project
website (www.hipsci.org). The A53T mutation in the human SNCA gene was
generated by two base substitutions in this codon (GCA > ACC) using CRISPR/
Cas9-induced homology directed repair in the kolf_2_C1 human iPSC line27. Cells
were grown in TeSR-E8 (Stem Cell Technologies) on Synthemax (Corning) coated
dishes, and expanded as clumps. Mutagenesis was achieved by nucleofection
(Lonza, P3 kit, program CA137) of a single cell suspension of 106 cells with Cas9-
crRNA-tracrRNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. Synthetic RNA oligonu-
cleotides (target site: 5′-GTGGTGCATGGTGTGGCAAC-3′, 225 pmol crRNA/
tracrRNA, IDT) were annealed by heating to 95 °C for 2 min in duplex buffer
(IDT) then cooled slowly, followed by addition of 122 pmol recombinant eSp-
Cas9_1.1 protein (in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1
mM DTT), incubation at room temperature for 20 min, and addition of 500 pmol
of a 100 nt ssDNA oligonucleotide (IDT Ultramer) as a homology-directed repair
template to introduce the desired base change. After recovery, plating at single cell
density and colony picking into 96 well plates, 288 clones were screened for het-
erozygous and homozygous mutations by high throughput sequencing of ampli-
cons spanning the target site using an Illumina MiSeq instrument using primers
A53TintF 5′-AGTTGTATTGAAAACTAGCTAATCAGC-3′ and A53TintR 5′-
CATAGGAATCTTGAATACTGGGCC-3′. Final cell lines were expanded and
further validated by a second round of sequencing. Independently targeted
homozygous or heterozygous clones were used in downstream assays.
Human iPS Cell culture and drug treatment. Human iPSCs were cultured in
TeSR-E8 medium (Stem Cell Technologies) on Vitronectin (Thermo Fisher Sci-
entific) coated plates. Cells were passaged with 0.5 mM EDTA when reaching 70%
confluency at a ratio of 1:6. Differentiation into dopaminergic neurons was per-
formed according to previously described protocols with slight modifications28.
Briefly, iPSCs were dissociated into single cells and plated at 150,000 cells/cm2 on
Matrigel (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coated plates. Cells were grown for 11 days in
knockout serum replacement media (KSR) supplemented with LDN-193189 (100
nM, Stemgent), SB431542 (10 µM, R&D Systems), SAG (100 nM, Enzo Life Sci-
ences), Purmorphamine (2 µM, Stemgent), FGF8a (100 ng/ml, R&D Systems) and
CHIR99021 (3 µM, Stemgent) and 2 mM L-glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
KSR medium was gradually changed to NNB medium containing Neurobasal
medium, N2 (0.5×) and B27 (0.5×) from day 6. Media was changed to NB medium
on day 12 containing Neurobasal medium, B27 (1×) and 2 mM L-glutamine
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with CHIR99021 (3 µM, Stemgent) (until
day 14) and with BDNF (20 ng/ml, Peprotech), GDNF (20 ng/ml, Peprotech),
Ascorbic Acid (200 µM, Sigma-Aldrich), TGFβ3, 1 ng/ml, Thermo Fisher Scien-
tific), dibutyryl cAMP (500 µM; Sigma-Aldrich), and DAPT (10 µM, Stemgent). At
day 21 cells were dissociated with StemPro Accutase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and
replated at 300,000 cells/cm2 in dishes pre-coated with Matrigel in final differ-
entiation medium (NB with BDNF, GDNF, TGFb3, DAPT, dbcAMP and Ascorbic
Acid). Cells were then cultured for 3 further weeks before treatments were initiated.
Cells were treated with 100 nM felodipine and DMSO for 5 days. Drug was
replenished after 48 h twice during the experiment. Cells (neurons) were collected
and lysed in 2× Laemmmli buffer. Samples were analysed by western blotting with
primary antibodies, rabbit anti-α-synuclein antibody (1:1000) (ab138501; Abcam)
and mouse anti-actin antibody (1:5000) (ab3280, Abcam),
Animal studies. All zebrafish and mouse procedures were performed in accor-
dance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act with appropriate Home
Office Project and Personal animal licences and with local Ethics Committee
approval. Zebrafish and mice were maintained and experiments were performed in
accordance with ARRIVE guidelines. The protocols and procedures for the study of
minipigs, were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee, Guangzhou
Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Maintenance of zebrafish stocks and transgenic lines: Zebrafish were bred and
maintained under standard conditions at 28.5 ± 0.5 °C on a 14 h light: 10 h dark
cycle. Embryos were collected at 4–5 h post-fertilisation in embryo medium (EM)
(5 mM NaCl, 0.17 mM KCl, 0.33 mMCaCl2, 0.33 mM Mg2SO4, 5 mM HEPES) and
thereafter kept in a temperature controlled incubator at 28 °C and staged according
to established criteria29. Generation of the Rho::EGFP-Taucu7 was previously
described11. The atg7 (atg7sa14768) mutant fish line harbours a nonsense (C/T)
mutation in exon 15 of 23 of atg7, resulting in a premature stop codon at amino
acid 448 (of 697). Heterozygous fish were obtained from the Zebrafish Mutation
Project30. This line was outcrossed for 2 generations, then crossed to Rho::EGFP-
Taucu7 fish to generate Rho::EGFP-Taucu7;atg7+/− fish. Fish carrying the atg7
mutation were genotyped by allele-specific amplification using a custom-designed
KASP assay from LGC Genomics. The UAS::Dendra-tauA152Tcu10 line was
generated as previously reported13. The pan-neuronal Gal4 driver line (hereafter
referred to as PanN::Gal4VP16) was a kind gift from Herwig Baier (identified as
line s1101tEt in the original publication31).
Outcrosses of Rho::EGFP-Taucu7;atg7+/− to atg7+/− were used to generate
wildtype or atg7 knockout fish (atg7+/+ and atg7−/−, respectively) expressing
EGFP-tau in the rod photoreceptors. Crosses of the responder fish UAS::Dendra-
tauA152T with PanN::Gal4VP16 driver fish were used to generate experimental
offspring with Dendra-tauA152T expressed throughout the central nervous system.
Mice: Mice were housed in individually ventilated cages with free access to
standard animal food chow and water, in a climate-controlled room with a 12 h
light/dark cycle. We used two different neurodegenerative disease mouse models
and one mRFP-GFP-LC3 reporter line in this study. The autophagy reporter
mRFP-GFP-LC3 mouse line was generated in our lab as previously described8.
HD-N171–82Q mice, also called B6HD mice ((B6C3F1/J-Tg(HD82Gln)81 Dbo/J,
Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbour, ME, USA), carry an N-terminal fragment of the
first 171 amino acids of human huntingtin with 82 glutamine repeats under the
mouse prion promoter15. This line has been backcrossed on a C57BL/6J
background for more than 10 generations. Previous work has shown that both male
and female mice develop aggregates17 whereas male mice display more robust
behavioural deficits32. Therefore, male mice were used for behavioural analysis and
female mice were used for histological analysis. Hu α-syn (A53T) mice, also called
SNCA(A53T)G2-3 line, or PrPsynA53T Tg mice (B6.Cg-Tg(Prnp-SNCA*A53T)
23Mkle/J, from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbour, ME, USA) express a 436 bp
human α-synuclein cDNA bearing the familial Parkinson’s disease-linked A53T
missense mutation driven by the mouse prion protein promoter21. SNCA mice
were monitored daily to assess any adverse effects arising from drug treatment and
to assess the symptoms of SNCA pathology. The following known symptoms of
SNCA pathology were used as humane endpoints for the mice, which resulted in
euthanasia: marked loss of appetite and fluid intake, staring coat, hunched posture,
subdued behaviour, tremor, episodic seizures and dystonia. HD mouse endpoints
are listed under B6HD mice efficacy trial below.
The litters of transgenic mice were genotyped from 3 weeks old onwards by
PCR, according to the protocols recommended either by the Jackson Laboratory or
by the authors the publications characterising these mice lines. The primer
sequences for mRFP-GFP-LC3 mice genotyping are:
RFP-GFP-fwd: (5′-ACCTCCCACAACGAGGACTA-3′) and
RFP-GFP-rev: (5′-ACCTTGTGGCCGTTTACGTCG-3′).
Fig. 5 Felodipine clears mutant A53T a-synuclein in iPSC-derived human neurons and in vivo. a Representative western blots for α-synuclein in iPSC-
derived human neurons homozygous for A53T α-synuclein mutation treated with 100 nM felodpine for 5 days. Densitometry data mean +/− SEM (α-
synuclein vs. actin loading control; n = 3 independent experiments in triplicate; one-tailed, one sample t-test). Data normalised to control, set at 100. All
nine data points are shown for the control and felodipine-treated samples. The data were also significant (p = 0.008) when each of the nine data points for
control and treated samples were compared by t test. b–e Male and female SNCA mice (6.5 months-old; n = 20 felodipine; n = 19 vehicle) were implanted
with subcutaneous felodipine-loaded osmotic minipumps (ALZET Model 2002) for 28 days, which were replaced once at day 14. At day 27, 17 felodipine
and 18 vehicle control mice were available for analysis—some mice were culled for health reasons other than drug side effects. Behaviour was tested once
before implanting and 14 days and 27 days after treatment (7 and 7.5 months-old, respectively). At the end of the study, 11 mice per group were used for
biochemistry (b, c) and the remainder (9 felodipine; 8 vehicle) were used for histology. b Soluble and insoluble α-synuclein fractions of brain lysates from

 Minipigs: Wild-type female Bama pigs, weighing 12–33 kg (Guangzhou
Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences) were utilised
for the studies. The protocol was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee
of GIBH. Animals were maintained on standard animal chow and water ad libitum,
in a climate-controlled room (23 ± 1℃, 30–70% relative humidity, a minimum of
10 exchanges of room air per hour and a 12 h light/dark cycle) for one week prior
to the experiments.
Drug administration to animals. Compound treatment in zebrafish transgenic
lines: Embryos from natural spawnings were collected in EM and reared at 28.5 °C.
Larvae from the outcross of Rho::EGFP-Taucu7;atg7+/− to heterozygous atg7+/−
were treated from 1 d.p.f. with EM containing 0.03% phenylthiourea (PTU) to
prevent pigmentation. At 3 d.p.f, larvae were screened for EGFP expression in the
rod photoreceptors and then removed from PTU and reared in EM. Larvae were
treated either with 10 µM verapamil, 0.1 µM felodipine or 0.1% DMSO from 4 to 10
d.p.f. Compounds and EM were refreshed daily. At 10 d.p.f., larvae were anaes-
thetised, and tails and heads were dissected. Heads were fixed in 4% PFA in PBS for
the analysis of rod photoreceptor numbers. Tails were processed to extract genomic
DNA and used for PCR analysis. Genotyping for atg7 was performed by allele-
specific amplification using reagents from a custom-designed KASP assay from
LGC Genomics using previously described methods30. Dendra-tauA152T expres-
sing embryos were reared in EM until 1 d.p.f. then treated with 0.1% DMSO, 10 µM
verapamil or 0.1 µM felodipine either from 1 to 3 d.p.f. then processed for western
blots and the quantification of phenotypes, or from 1 to 6 d.p.f. for analysis of
sarkosyl soluble and insoluble fraction. Drugs and medium were replenished daily.
Felodipine administration to mice and minipigs
via i.p. injection
Felodipine (Sigma F9677) for i.p. injections was prepared as a stock solution of 20 mg/ml
in 20% ethanol. On the injection day, this was diluted to 1 or 0.5 mg/ml in 0.15 M NaCl,
5% Tween-20 and 5% PEG400 freshly before injection.
via subcutaneous osmotic minipump
Felodipine (Sigma F9677) solution in 49% DMSO and 49% PEG300, 2% Tween20 was
given subcutaneously as a continuous infusion with a daily dose of 5 mg/kg body weight
by implanting osmotic pumps (0.25 or 0.5 μl/h flow rate, Alzet Model 2004 and 2002,
respectively). Felodipine concentration in the minipump was adjusted according to each
animal’s body weight to obtain a delivery of 5 mg/kg body weight /day and the pumps
were primed by soaking in saline at 37 °C overnight.
via gastric gavage to minipigs
Felodipine was dissolved in a solution containing 2% DMSO, 4% ethanol, 4% castor oil
and 90% ddH2O. Animals were randomly distributed into 4 experimental groups (n = 2).
All groups were given 2.5 mg/kg orally by gastric gavage.
B6HD mice efficacy trial. Treated and untreated mice, as well as wild-type and
transgenic littermates were housed together and identified by ear notches. Thus,
observer was blind to their treatment and genetic status during behavioural testing.
22 B6HD male transgenic mice were used for felodipine treatment and 22 trans-
genic male animals were used for the control (vehicle) group. We also included 11
wild-type male mice (littermates) for felodipine and 12 vehicle (control) treated
male mice to study the effect of felodipine on behavioural parameters in non-
diseased animals. At 5 weeks of age, a pre-assessment of motor performances using
rotarod was performed. There were no significant differences in test performances
in the mice assigned to the treatment and placebo groups at 5 weeks. Felodipine
treatment was started at 6 weeks age. The mice were weighed and received i.p.
injections (5 mg/kg body weight felodipine) three times a week (Monday, Wed-
nesday and Friday). The vehicle control group received i.p. injections with the
carrier substance (0.15 M NaCl, 5% Tween-20 and 5% PEG 400 and 2% ethanol).
Mice were monitored daily to assess any adverse effects arising from drug treat-
ment and to assess the symptoms of HD pathology. The following known symp-
toms of HD pathology were used as humane endpoints for the mice, which resulted
in euthanasia: marked loss of appetite and fluid intake, staring coat, hunched
posture, tremor, subdued behaviour, or 15% weight loss over a period of less than
3 days (see Supplementary Table 6).
Behavioural testing. We assessed rotarod motor performance at week 10, 14 and
18, with one pre-trial testing at week 5 (Accelerating Model, Ugo Basile, Biological
Research Apparatus, Varese, Italy), as described in17. Tests for grip strength, wire
manoeuvre and tremor monitoring were performed at 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19 and
21 weeks of age. Wire manoeuvre and tremor are part of the SHIRPA battery of
behavioural tests18. Grip strength was monitored quantitatively by using a grip
strength metre (Biosep, France), as described17. Mice were scored on their ability to
perform the wire manoeuvre task, scores were set as: 0, active grip with hind legs; 1,
difficulty grasping with hind legs; 2, unable to lift hind legs; 3, falls within 30 s; 4,
falls immediately.
Blood and brain sampling of mice and minipigs. Mice: 10 week old wild-type
male mice (C57Bl/6J) were i.p. injected with 5 mg/ kg body weight felodipine then
anaesthetised using isoflurane at 6 different time-points (i.e., 5 min, 15 min, 60 min,
120 min, 240 min, and 8 h). Once anaesthetised, a terminal blood sample was taken
by cardiac puncture. Blood (0.3–0.8 ml) was collected in EDTA tubes (Microvette
100K3E, Sarstedt), The plasma fraction was immediately separated by centrifuga-
tion (3000 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C), placed on dry ice then stored at −80 °C until LC-MS
analysis to determine drug concentration. After confirming death by cervical dis-
location, the brains were collected and frozen on dry ice then stored at −80 °C until
LC-MS analysis.
Repeat blood sampling (via saphenous vein) was performed during the course
of continuous dosing of felodipine via osmotic minipump according to the
experiment (either at day 10 and 20 for Alzet Model 2002 or day 14 for Alzet
Model 2004) followed by collection of a terminal sample at day 28. On each
occasion, blood samples of 100–120 μl was collected in EDTA tubes (Microvette
300K2E, Sarstedt). The plasma fraction was separated and stored as described
above.
Pharmacokinetic analysis for PK parameters of plasma and brain was
performed by Q3 Analytical Ltd.
Minipigs: After administration of felodipine, whole blood samples (500 μl) were
obtained from the orbital venous plexus for terminal sampling at the following
time-points after dosing: 2, 4, 6 and 8 h and from the jugular vein for serial
collection at 5, 15, 30 min and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h from the same animal.
Whole blood samples were collected in heparinized tubes. The plasma fraction
was immediately separated by centrifugation (3000 rpm, 6 min, 4 °C) and stored at
−20 °C until LC-MS analysis. The animals were culled humanely by euthanasia by
carbon dioxide 24 h after experiment.
Analysis of zebrafish experiments. Imaging and quantification of photoreceptors
of zebrafish: 10 μm transverse cryosections through the zebrafish retina were cut
using a Bright cryostat. Sections were examined to identify the optic nerve head
(central retina) and 5 sections at the level of the optic nerve head were imaged
using a Zeiss Axioplan2 fluorescent microscope equipped with a QImaging Retiga
2000 R digital camera. Fluorescence images of the GFP-signal were then analysed
by Fiji software (ImageJ) with binary options and automatic quantification in
specific regions of interest (ROIs) corresponding to the photoreceptor layer.
Tau sarkosyl extraction for zebrafish: Tau soluble and insoluble fractionation
was performed using the sarkosyl extraction protocol33 with minor modifications
as described in Lopez et al.13. Samples were run on 10% acrylamide SDS-PAGE
gels. Blots were blocked in 5% non-fat milk in PBS-T and incubated with primary
antibodies; mouse antibody Tau5 (1:1000) (ab80579, Abcam) and mouse anti-
tubulin (1:2000) (T9026, Sigma-Aldrich).
Analysis of brains from mouse experiments. For immunohistochemistry and
fluorescent imaging of autophagosomes and autolysosomes, mice were perfused
with ice-cold PBS and 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS (w/v, pH 7.4) after deep
anaesthesia by i.p. injection of pentobarbital sodium (euthatal). Brains were
removed and post fixed for 1–2 h in the same fixative. After cryoprotection in 30%
sucrose/PBS (w/v, pH 7.4) for 2–3 days at 4 °C, brains were frozen on dry ice and
stored in −80 °C. For analysis of soluble and insoluble α-synuclein, the mice were
humanely killed by a schedule 1 method and brains were collected.
Immunohistochemistry and quantification of mouse brains. For mutant hun-
tingtin aggregate analysis, 30 μm thick coronal sections of cortex of HD mice brain
(felodipine-and vehicle-treated) were analysed for neuronal inclusions according to
established protocols17,34. Sections were labelled with anti-huntingtin antibody by
free-floating immunohistochemistry (EM48, Chemicon). Staining was performed
by peroxidase labelling using Vectastain Avidin:Biotinylated enzyme complex
(ABC) kit and visualised with DAB reagent (Vector Laboratories). Mutant hun-
tingtin inclusions were counted blind in the piriform cortex and motor cortex in
three fields on five sections per animal at a magnification of X100 (Zeiss Axios-
kop2, field diameter 0.2 mm). The percentage of cells with aggregates was nor-
malised to the mean percentage of vehicle control to allow comparison between
independent experiments. Statistical analysis was carried out using one-way
ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison in initial experiments (Fig. 2d, e) and
by one-tailed, unpaired, t-test thereafter (Fig. 4e, f).
For TH IHC labelling of the substantia nigra of SNCA mice brains, serial coronal
sections (50 μm thick, bregma −2.46 to −4.04) were cut using a cryostat. Every sixth
section was selected and antigen retrieval was performed by heating to 100 °C in 1X
sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0 in PBS (Sigma) for 20 min. In order to inactivate the
endogenous peroxidase activity, the sections were incubated in 3% hydrogen peroxide
in 20% methanol for 20 min at room temperature. Sections were blocked with 5%
goat serum (Sigma-Aldrich)/PBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100 (v/v) for 30 min, followed
by avidin/biotin blocking, as instructed by manufacturer (Vector Laboratories). The
sections were washed 3 times with 1X PBS after each step above, where each wash was
for 5–10 min. Finally, the sections were incubated with TH antibody (ab112; Abcam)
1:200 in 5% goat serum in PBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100 (v/v) overnight, followed by
incubation with biotin-conjugated secondary antibodies to rabbit, ABC reagents
(Vector Laboratories), and visualised with DAB reagent (Vector Laboratories). Free
floating stained sections were then mounted on gelatin-coated slides, air dried and
then counterstained with Nissl (0.09% thionin, w/v) as described previously35.

 Sections were dehydrated in 100% ethanol and cleared in Xylene (Fisher Scientific)
followed by mounting with DPX (BDH).
Unbiased estimates of the number of TH-positive neurons from the SN region
were determined using optical dissector method. A counting frame of 150 μm ×
150 μm was placed in a systematic random fashion throughout SN regions (both
left and right side simultaneously). This method was carried out at ×20
magnification using a microscope imaging system (Olympus BX53) equipped with
a computer-controlled motorised stage and Stereo Investigator software
(MicroBrightField). The total count of TH-stained neurons in substantia nigra was
quantified and mean values were calculated for all the sections for each mouse.
Data was analysed by two-tailed unpaired t-test.
Quantification of mRFP-GFP-LC3 vesicles in mouse brains. For analysis of
autophagosomes and autolysosomes in the brains of mRFP-GFP-LC3 mice, 8 μm
thick sagittal sections were cut from perfused, cryo-protected mRFP-GFP-LC3
mouse brains. Sections were mounted on poly-lysine coated slides and air dried for
2 h at room temperature. To reduce auto fluorescence, sections were stained in
0.05% Sudan Black in 70% methanol for 5–10 min36. Sections were air dried for 10
min and mounted using Citifluor AF1 with DAPI (1:1000). Sections were imaged
using a confocal LSM 710 (Carl Zeiss), equipped with a digital camera and operated
with ZEN imaging software. All slides were imaged using the same settings, except
for minor changes on Digital Offset, if needed.
Five confocal images for cerebral cortex and 4–5 images for Purkinje cells
(covering 20 neurons) were quantified. The number of mRFP-GFP-LC3 dots
(autophagosomes, yellow) and mRFP-LC3 dots (autolysosomes, red) were counted
manually within a single frame for cerebral cortex and in various fames covering 20
Purkinje neurons, switching between the red and green channels to confirm that
each yellow vesicle is also red (otherwise ignoring the yellow vesicles which were
not red) while counting. Numbers of autophagosomes were quantified per frame
for cortex and per neuron for Purkinje cells, as the latter are easily discriminated.
ZEN 2011 imaging software was used for counting. The experimenter was blind to
the treatments or slide names or numbers. To avoid inter-operator variability
within an experiment, only one person counted all the replicates of one experiment.
In some cases, samples were collected from different litters over a short period
of time; therefore analysis was performed as a single experiment (Supplementary
Fig. 3a, b and d). Alternatively, when samples were collected over an extended
period of time, values were normalised to the mean of autolysosome levels of the
vehicle control of that individual experimental group (as in Fig. 2a, b, c, Fig. 4d and
Supplementary Fig. 3c). Mean values of each vesicle type (autophagosomes,
autolysosomes and total vesicles) of felodipine-treated mice were compared to the
mean value of the same vesicle type of vehicle-treated mice (control). Statistical
analysis was performed comparing autolysosome number or total vesicle number
for treatment vs. control using one sample one-tailed unpaired t-test, since we had
prior evidence that felodipine treatment would increase autophagy.
When we analysed double transgenic mRFP-GFP-LC3/B6HD mice, we
analysed only males implanted with felodipine-loaded minipumps (5 mg/kg/day)
with 0.25 μl/h flow rate for 28 days. One hemisphere was analysed for mRFP-GFP-
LC3 vesicles, while the other was analysed for huntingtin aggregates.
α-synuclein soluble and insoluble extraction. SNCA (A53T) G2–3 mice brain
regions (cerebral cortex and brain stem) were dissected out and soluble and
insoluble fractionation was performed using the modified protocol as described37.
Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay and 40 μg of
protein was loaded onto 15% acrylamide SDS-PAGE gels. The same vehicle-treated
control mouse sample was loaded on each gel to allow normalisation between
independent blots. Blots were blocked in 5% non-fat milk in PBS-T and incubated
with primary antibodies, rabbit anti-α-synuclein antibody (1:1000) (ab138501;
Abcam); mouse anti-GAPDH antibody (1:5000) (ab8245, Abcam), followed by
appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies and analysed with a LICOR-Odyssey
apparatus using IMAGE STUDIO Lite software, which enables quantitative
analysis of blotting signals. GAPDH was used as loading control for both fractions.
Statistical analysis. Data are presented as mean values ± SEM (standard error
mean) or SD (standard deviation) calculated using Microscoft Excel and GraphPad
Prism 7 software. p < 0.05 was considered as the threshold for statistical sig-
nificance. Exact p values are provided throughout. Statistical analysis was per-
formed using one tailed or two-tailed Student’s t-test or one-way ANOVA followed
by appropriate post hoc test for multiple comparisons using GraphPad Prism 7
unless otherwise stated.
