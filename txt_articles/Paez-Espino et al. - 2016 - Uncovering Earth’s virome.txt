Viruses are the most abundant entities across all habitats, and a major 
reservoir of genetic diversity1 affecting biogeochemical cycles and 
 
ecosystem dynamics1. Exploration of viral populations in oceans of 
the world and within the human microbiome has illuminated consid-
erable genetic complexity2,3; however, there are significant gaps in the 
global virome catalogue. There are an estimated 1031 viral  
particles 
infecting microbial populations4; yet fewer than 2,200 genomes from 
double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses and retroviruses are  
deposited 
in NCBI, compared to over 45,000 bacterial genomes5. Culture-
independent approaches have provided a broader view of the diversity 
and distribution of dsDNA viruses6. However, their accurate detection 
 
and quantification using targeted sequencing remains challenging 
owing to the lack of universally conserved genomic signatures and 
complex experimental protocols7.
Beyond gaps in characterized diversity, the scope of host–viral 
 
interactions is poorly understood, although it has been hypothesized 
that all cellular organisms are prey to viral attack8. Methods for studying 
host–viral interactions rely almost exclusively on cultured virus–host 
systems; however, recent in silico approaches have revealed that a much 
broader range of hosts is susceptible to viral infections9,10. Given the 
role that viruses play in host metabolism reprogramming, gene flow, 
and structuring of microbial communities, it is critical to capture viral 
linkages with their hosts.
Currently, a plethora of metagenomic data exists that present a 
unique opportunity for viral sequence discovery11. Although most of 
these data sets were generated by untargeted approaches without viral 
particle enrichment, they contain a wealth of viral sequences. Here, 
we developed a computational approach to explore the viral content 
of more than 3,000 metagenomic samples. We uncovered 2.1 Gb of 
viral sequence data, which increases the known viral sequence space by 
an order of magnitude, enables the prediction of previously unknown 
host–viral interactions and provides a global view of viral biogeography.
Global expansion of viral sequence space
In the absence of universally conserved markers, previous studies 
attempted to identify viruses using proteins present exclusively in 
viruses12. To overcome the limitations of a biased collection of  
isolate 
viruses (iVGs), we complemented the viral protein families of the 
iVGs (derived from dsDNA viruses and retroviruses in the NCBI 
database) with a set of viral protein families from 1,800 manually 
identified metagenomic viral contigs (mVCs). This set was used as a 
bait to identify putative viral sequences in a large collection of assem-
bled metagenomic contigs longer than 5 kb (Methods; Extended Data 
Figs 1–3; Supplementary Tables 1–7). These contigs were obtained 
from 3,042 metagenomes in the Integrated Microbial Genomes with 
Microbiome Samples (IMG/M) system11 (Supplementary Table 8), rep-
resenting a collection of  
geographically and ecologically diverse sam-
ples according to metadata from the Genomes OnLine Database5,13. 
This led to the identification of 125,842 putative DNA metagenomic 
viral contigs, increasing the viral sequence size in base pairs by 17.3-
fold and the number of viral genes by 16.6-fold (Fig. 1a; Methods). 
These encode more than 2.79 million proteins, 75% of which have no 
sequence similarity to proteins from known isolate viruses, consistent 
with previous studies12,14. Sequence similarity clustering of proteins 
encoded by the mVCs resulted in a total of 418,541 clusters with 2 or 
more members and 765,991  
singletons (Methods; Supplementary Table 
9). Benchmarking was performed to validate our computational pipe-
line, and indicated that 70% of the sequences identified in this study 
would have been missed by other methods (Methods; Extended Data 
Fig. 3; Supplementary Tables 2–6).
To evaluate the coverage of the viral protein space by the newly 
identified sequences, we estimated the rate of accumulation of protein 
clusters as a function of the number of samples (Fig. 1b). In agreement 
with recent reports9,15, the curves of cluster accumulation in the two 
most heavily sampled habitats, human-associated and marine, appear 
to reach saturation. However, the rate of cluster discovery does not 
plateau when all samples are considered, suggesting that the global viral 
sequence space is largely uncharacterized.
To compare the coverage of mVCs and iVGs by viral protein  
families, 
we calculated the percentage of genes with hits to viral protein  
families 
relative to the total number of genes on each contig (Fig. 1c). On 
the basis of this percentage, viral contigs were classified into three 
 
categories: those with at least 70% of genes in viral families (highly 
covered with strong similarity to viruses in the training set); those 
with 35–70% of genes in viral families; and those with less than 35% 
of genes in viral families (low covered with low similarity to viruses 
Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on Earth, but challenges in detecting, isolating, and classifying unknown 
viruses have prevented exhaustive surveys of the global virome. Here we analysed over 5 Tb of metagenomic sequence data 
from 3,042 geographically diverse samples to assess the global distribution, phylogenetic diversity, and host specificity of 
viruses. We discovered over 125,000 partial DNA viral genomes, including the largest phage yet identified, and increased 
the number of known viral genes by 16-fold. Half of the predicted partial viral genomes were clustered into genetically 
distinct groups, most of which included genes unrelated to those in known viruses. Using CRISPR spacers and transfer 
RNA matches to link viral groups to microbial host(s), we doubled the number of microbial phyla known to be infected 
by viruses, and identified viruses that can infect organisms from different phyla. Analysis of viral distribution across 
diverse ecosystems revealed strong habitat-type specificity for the vast majority of viruses, but also identified some 
cosmopolitan groups. Our results highlight an extensive global viral diversity and provide detailed insight into viral 
habitat distribution and host–virus interactions.

in the  
training set) (Extended Data Fig. 4a). The highly covered cate-
gory included 67% of isolate viruses, but only 24.5% of mVCs (Fig. 1c), 
 
the majority of them from marine and human-associated habitats, 
where more reference viruses were available (Fig. 1d). Another 24.2% 
of mVCs placed in the low-covered category were typically found in 
soil, plant-associated, and engineered samples (Fig. 1d). The differences 
were even more pronounced when the data were normalized by total 
sequence length per habitat (Methods), suggesting the need for more 
extensive sampling of these environments.
The length of mVCs ranges from 5 kb to nearly 600 kb  
(average 
16,625 ± 
 18,057 bp) (Fig. 1c). On the basis of the end overlaps, 999 of 
mVCs were probably circular, representing complete viral genomes 
(Supplementary Table 10). The average size of the circular mVCs 
(53,644 ± 
 45,677 bp) is consistent with the calculated average length 
of isolate dsDNA viruses (44,296 ± 
 83,777 bp) (Supplementary 
Information). Among circular contigs, we identified the largest phage 
recovered to date, a 596 kb contig from a bioreactor sample16, with many 
signature genes of tailed viruses, but no recognizable  
housekeeping 
genes of bacteria or plasmids (Methods; Extended Data Fig. 4b; 
Supplementary Table 11; Supplementary Information). We identified 
six more mVCs ranging from 350 to 470 kb, probably  
representing 
fragments of other large phage genomes (Supplementary Table 12). 
As the sizes of viral particles and viral genomes are  
correlated17, these 
mVCs found in many ecological niches point to the hidden diversity 
and abundance of very large phages, probably avoiding detection by 
the conventional enrichment methods.
Sequence grouping to gauge viral diversity
To quantify the amount of taxonomic diversity, mVCs and isolate viral 
genomes were clustered into quasi-species groups on the basis of the 
average amino acid identity18 (AAI) of all proteins and single-linkage 
clustering, using an approach analogous to the whole-genome-based 
classification scheme developed for prokaryotes19 (Methods; Extended 
Data Fig. 5a; Supplementary Table 13). 64,160 mVCs and 2,536  
isolate 
contigs were clustered into 18,470 viral groups, ranging from 2 to 
365 members per group. Most groups (57%) had only 2 members and 
only 3.7% had more than 10 members (Extended Data Fig. 5b). Similar 
to previous studies12,14,20, the vast majority of viral groups (95.9%) did 
not contain isolate viruses.
218 viral groups and 842 singletons contained at least one iVG 
with genus- and species-level taxonomic assignment according to 
the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (Methods; 
Supplementary Tables 14, 15). Our method recapitulates current 
 
species-level groupings in 87% of the cases with the remainder  
grouping 
at genus level (Supplementary Table 14; Extended Data Fig. 5c–e). 
 
We compared our method with sequence-based classification used in 
 
previous studies, which applied protein cluster occurrence to  
generate 
mostly genus-level groups21. In agreement with an assessment that 
our groups represent quasi-species, our approach resulted in smaller 
clusters and more singletons (Supplementary Information). Next we 
proceeded to predict host specificity and determine environmental 
distribution of these species-level viral groups and singletons.
Host–virus connectivity revealed
We used a suite of computational methods to identify putative host–
virus connections. First, we projected the isolate viral–host  
information 
onto a group, resulting in host assignments for 2.4% of viral groups 
 
(Fig. 2a). Then we used the CRISPR–Cas prokaryotic immune 
 
system, which holds a ‘library’ of genome fragments from phages 
 
(proto-spacers) that have previously infected the host22. These  
fragments 
retained by the host in the form of spacers can be matched to phage 
genomes linking phages with their hosts23–25. We amassed a database of 
3.5 million spacers from prokaryotic isolate genomes and  
metagenomes 
in IMG (Supplementary Tables 16, 17). As a control, 98.5% of spacer 
matches against isolate viral genomes agreed with their known 
host  
specificity at genus or species level (Methods; Supplementary 
Information; Supplementary Table 18). Spacers from isolate  
microbial 
genomes with matches to mVCs were identified for 4.4% of the viral

groups and 1.7% of singletons (Supplementary Table 19). Finally, we 
explored the hypothesis that viral transfer RNA (tRNA) genes origi-
nate from their host26. Using stringent sequence identity  
cutoffs, viral 
tRNAs identified in 7.6% of the mVCs were matched to isolate genomes 
from a single species or genus (Methods; Supplementary Information; 
Supplementary Tables 20–22). The specificity of tRNA-based host-viral 
assignment was confirmed by CRISPR–Cas spacer matches showing a 
94% agreement at the genus level (Supplementary Table 19).
Overall, these approaches identified 9,992 putative host–virus 
 
associations enabling host assignment to 7.7% of mVCs. The  
majority 
of these connections were previously unknown, and include hosts 
from 16 prokaryotic phyla for which no viruses have previously been 
 
identified (Supplementary Table 23), such as the first instance of viruses 
infecting the candidate phylum SR1 (Fig. 2b). We also connected mVCs 
to pathogenic species for which no viral connections were known, 
including Fusobacterium and Leptotrichia that cause oral and skin 
infections in mammals (Supplementary Information; Supplementary 
Table 24). The discovery of phages infecting these and other pathogens 
could be exploited for phage therapy applications27,28.
It is widely assumed that most viruses specialize in infecting related 
hosts, as broad host range is negatively correlated with infection 
 
success29. However, this may be an artefact29, and viral generalists that 
infect hosts across taxonomic orders do exist30. Our data  
suggested a 
trend for narrow host range with some notable exceptions. Whereas 
most CRISPR spacer matches were from viral sequences to hosts within 
one species or genus (Fig. 3a), some mVCs were linked to  
multiple 
hosts from higher taxa, including different phyla. A viral group 
 
comprised of mVCs from human oral samples contained three distinct 
 
proto-spacers with nearly exact matches to spacers in Actinobacteria 
and Firmicutes (Fig. 3b). In another case (Fig. 3c), proto-spacers from 
two mVCs derived from faecal samples were linked to spacers in three 
distinct Clostridiales families (Extended Data Fig. 6; Supplementary 
Information). As viruses exploit the host transcription/translation 
machinery, the existence of viruses with a surprisingly broad range 
of hosts opens opportunities for identification of novel enzymes or 
 
regulatory sequences, with biotechnological applications.
Biogeographic patterns of viral diversity
Previous studies of viral biogeography mainly focused on single 
 
habitats3,31,32, and only a handful of small-scale studies explored 
viromes across environments33–35. As our pipeline was designed to 
identify longer viral contigs that probably represent more  
abundant 
populations, we explored the dispersal of the predicted viruses 
by  
aligning the contigs against all assembled and unassembled

metagenome sequences (Methods; Supplementary Information). 
This approach revealed that 86% of the viral sequences were found in 
more than one sample, whereas 73% were present in at least 5 samples 
(Extended Data Fig. 7a), mostly from relatively well-sampled marine 
and human-associated habitats. This enabled a detailed investigation of 
viral distribution patterns across these environments (Fig. 4).
The distribution of viral sequences in marine samples is charac-
terized by distinct spatial patterns based on water column depth 
and distance from the shore (Fig. 4a). Although viral  
assemblages in 
coastal waters from distant biogeographical provinces are  
markedly 
different,  
bathypelagic samples from different oceanic basins  
display 
very similar viral profiles, in agreement with observations that 
deep ocean phylum-level composition of microbial communities is 
 
relatively uniform36. Although viral sequences are mostly partitioned 
into zone-specific groups, some are present in diverse samples across 
zones and oceanic provinces, including one viral group found in 95% 
of all twilight samples and in 44% of deep ocean samples (Extended 
Data Fig. 7b–c).
The distribution of viral sequences in human microbiome  
samples 
(Fig. 4b) also shows clear body-site specificity with only a few 
viral groups and singletons found in both faecal and oral samples 
(Supplementary Tables 25, 26). In contrast to previous studies2,37–39, 
many viral sequences, mostly of phage origin, were shared between 
samples from the same body site of unrelated individuals. More than 
30% of intestinal and 50% of oral viral sequences were shared by at least 
10% of sampled subjects (Extended Data Fig. 7d, e). Approximately 
0.5% of sequences in both body sites were shared by more than 80% of 
sampled individuals, whereas 17% and 9% of intestinal and oral viral 
sequences, respectively, were unique to each individual. We used raw 
sequencing reads to estimate the amount of viral sequences in 550 
 
faecal and oral samples. Viral fraction varied from 0.2 to 54% of the 
total amount of high quality sequence in the sample, with the average 
of 3.4% in oral samples and 7.4% in stool samples, which is higher than 
previously reported 2.5 to 3.5% in stool2 (Supplementary Information).
Although 84% of our quasi-species viral groups found in  
multiple 
samples resided within a single habitat type (Fig. 5a), 14% were found 
 
in two habitat types, typically, within the same broader environmental 
category (Fig. 5b, c), and a small number of groups were spanning 
two or more environmental categories (Fig. 5c, d; Supplementary 
Information; Supplementary Table 27). Most of these were due to 
uncertainty of habitat classification (for example, plant rhizosphere 
samples classified as host-associated) (Fig. 5c). A more detailed 
analysis of the most ubiquitous viral sequences revealed that they 
 
are probably human and laboratory contaminants, including Φ 
X and λ 
 
phages used as vectors, sequencing and molecular weight standards40, 
and Propionibacterium acnes phages, common inhabitants of human 
skin. Several viruses recovered in a wide variety of environments were 
found to be prophages with broad host specificity (Supplementary 
Information; Supplementary Table 28) infecting hosts with different 
habitat preferences. Some of these prophages were found to carry a 
variety of cargo genes, presumably conferring competitive advantage 
to their hosts and explaining their broad distribution41 (Extended Data 
Figs 8, 9). However, in a few cases, the presence of viral groups in diverse 
environments could not be attributed to  
metadata  
discrepancies, ambi-
guity of habitat classification, contamination or broad host specificity. 
A small number of viral groups was found in aquatic samples with large 
differences in salinity, such as freshwater and hypersaline lakes, whereas 
other groups were found in oil-contaminated wastewater, and in human 
oral and faecal samples (Fig. 5c, d; Supplementary Information). Our 
observations of a limited number of ubiquitous viruses expand on

previous studies35,42 that shed light on the mechanisms underlying their 
‘cosmopolitanism’
.
To generate a global map of viral dispersal, we linked the viral 
sequences with geographic coordinates of the corresponding  
samples. 
Many viruses were found in similar ecological niches across large 
geographic distances, with the most prominent connectivity within 
extensively sampled marine biome (Fig. 6a; Supplementary Table 8), 
which is in agreement with previous studies, suggesting that viruses are 
passively transported along oceanic currents3. We also observed sparse 
but non-negligible connections between non-marine viral groups and 
singletons in samples of the same habitat type across biomes (Fig. 6b) 
and across different ecosystems (Extended Data Fig. 10).
Discussion
This study shows that in-depth exploration of ecosystems by  
untargeted 
metagenome sequencing is a powerful approach to fill knowledge gaps 
and address fundamental questions of viral ecology. Our analysis led 
to a notable increase in the number of viral sequences and putative 
virus–host connections, demonstrating that a much larger prokaryotic 
 
diversity than previously known is preyed upon by viruses,  
expanding 
on a recent report of microbial lineages containing prophages21. 
Consistent with previous observations, the environmental viral 
 
quasi-species were mostly found to have a narrow host range with a 
few notable exceptions of phages with broad taxonomic host specificity, 
including examples of hosts from different phyla.
The global maps of viral biogeography show that viruses are predom-
inantly found in similar habitats, regardless their geographic  
proximity. 
This pattern was most prominent for marine viruses as previously 
observed3, yet was also striking across seemingly isolated locales such 
as lakes, plant-associated habitats and soils, where the dispersal mode 
is not immediately obvious. More surprising was the significant human 
virome sharing between unrelated individuals and the identification 
of viral quasi-species distributed across markedly different habitats.
Overall, this study demonstrates the value of untargeted de novo 
metagenomic analysis as compared to reference-based and targeted

METHODS
Data availability. All the sequence data and metadata from the samples used 
in this work could be accessed through the Integrated Microbial Genomes with 
Microbiomes system IMG/M database11 (https://img.jgi.doe.gov) using both 
metagenome and scaffold identifiers provided throughout the manuscript and 
the Supplementary Information. Thus, by using these identifiers in the Genome 
Search tool or Scaffold Search tool (under ‘Find Genomes’ tab) in the user inter-
face, the corresponding sequences, their annotations, as well as their associated 
metadata can be retrieved. Moreover, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) of viral 
protein families as well as the predicted DNA viral sequences in fasta format are 
available at the following public FTP site: (http://portal.nersc.gov/dna/microbial/
prokpubs/EarthVirome_DP/).
Metagenomic samples used in this study. All publicly available metagenomic 
data sets from the IMG/M system (3,042 samples comprising 5 terabase pairs 
 
of sequences) were used for this analysis11. The sample collection included 1,729 
 
environmental samples, 1,079 host-associated samples, and 234 engineered 
 
samples according to the Genomes OnLine sample classification5. We identified 
putative viral contigs in 1,882 out of the 3,042 metagenomic data sets. The metadata 
for these data sets including sample collection information, library construction 
and sequencing protocols, as well as assembly strategy were retrieved from GOLD 
 
database5. Based on GOLD metadata, the vast majority of these data sets were 
 
generated from dsDNA using an untargeted approach (that is, only 59 samples 
underwent viral particle enrichment, viral DNA enrichment or library  
construction 
with sequencing protocols optimized for the recovery of viral sequences). All of 
the data sets have been annotated by the IMG metagenome annotation pipeline44, 
which performs gene prediction and functional annotation through assignment 
of predicted proteins to protein families, such as Pfam45 and KEGG Orthology 
(KO) clusters46. Some of the data sets included both assembled and unassem-
bled data, while others had only assembled sequences (Supplementary Table 8). 
An assembly pipeline used for each data set is described in GOLD. In addition, 
the  
contiguity of assembled sequences varied greatly from sample to sample. The 
 
ecosystem subcategories here used were manually curated according to sample 
metadata  
establishing 10 distinct habitat types: marine, freshwater, non-marine- 
saline and alkaline,  
thermal springs, terrestrial soil, terrestrial others (including 
mostly deep subsurface samples), host-associated human, host-associated plants, 
host- 
associated others (including host animal-associated other than human), and 
engineered (for example, bioreactor) (Supplementary Table 8). Only contigs longer 
than 5 kb (59.5 Gb from 5.1 million contigs) were primarily included in this study.
Normalization factors. We normalized the data sets by the size of the sample 
(measured as total number of bp from sequences larger than 5 kb) per habitat 
type. The normalization factor used in each habitat type was: marine, 29,602 Mb; 
freshwater, 96,314 Mb; non-marine saline and alkaline, 2,825 Mb; thermal 
springs, 1,828 Mb; terrestrial (soil), 5,794 Mb; terrestrial (other), 1,659 Mb; host- 
associated (human), 10,349 Mb; host-associated (plants), 3,909 Mb; host-associated 
(others), 23,452 Mb; engineered, 10,486 Mb.
Isolate reference viruses (iVGs). We used a combination of 2,353 iVGs composed 
of all isolate dsDNA viruses and retroviruses from the NCBI server (http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/viruses/, data accessed on 04/2015) to extract all viral 
proteins and to establish, after filtering, the first round of viral protein families. 
Additionally, we used a list of 5,042 reference viruses (Supplementary Table 13) 
extracted from the IMG/M system (that included all RNA and DNA eukaryotic and 
prokaryotic referenced viral genomes) to generate and validate our viral genome 
clustering method and also to calculate the average length of all reference viruses 
as 44,296 bp ± 83,777 bp s.d. (Supplementary Table 13).
Generation of viral protein families. 167,042 protein coding genes were  
collected 
from 2,353 iVGs (dsDNA viruses and retroviruses combined) from the NCBI 
server (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/GenomesGroup.cgi?taxid= 
10239#). After dereplication using 70% identity in usearch47, 98,000 protein 
sequences were obtained from which 83,500 were clustered into 15,900 groups 
using the Markov Cluster (MCL) algorithm48. Proteins within clusters were 
aligned using MAFFT49 and a set of 14,296 viral protein families was created using 
hmmbuild50. After manual curation of the viral families with high representation in 
prokaryotic genomes, viral protein families were compared against the 5.1 million 
metagenomic contigs longer than 5 kb. 62,000 contigs with 5 or more viral protein 
families were collected, and these were reduced to 9,000 putative viral contigs 
after removing contigs below 50 kb. An additional filtering step was performed 
to exclude contigs with a high number of Kegg Orthology (KO) terms and Pfams 
(10% and 25% respectively); this reduced the number of putative viral contigs 
to 1,589. These were complemented with 66 and 188 sequences derived from 
diverse metagenomic contigs longer than 20 kb that were binned with viruses or 
 
contained a viral RNA polymerase gene, respectively, and were not captured using 
the  
previous filter of bearing 5 or more viral protein families (detailed in  
section 
below; Extended Data Fig. 2; Supplementary Table 1). A total of 1,843 mVCs 
encoding 191,000 proteins were used to complement the original set of 167,042 
proteins derived from iVGs. Repeating the steps described above (that is, usearch 
70% for de-replication, MCL clustering, MAFFT alignment and hmmbuild with a 
filter for viral families abundant in prokaryotes) the final list of 25,000 viral protein 
families was obtained and used for further exploration.
Identification of metagenomic viral contigs for a training set via manual 
 
curation, binning and DNA-dependent RNA polymerase alignment. To 
expand the training set of viral sequences, metagenome contigs identified as high- 
confidence viral sequences in the first iteration of our pipeline (Extended Data 
Fig. 1) were complemented with additional metagenome contigs and  
scaffolds, 
not  
captured using viral protein families generated from isolate viruses. The first 
approach used kmer-based binning of 6 metagenome samples that  
contained 
the highest number of candidate viral sequences, which were not satisfy high- 
confidence threshold due to insufficient number of hits to protein models. These 
data sets were binned by Emergent Self Organizing Maps (ESOM; by Ultsch) as 
described previously51 and contig sets outside the bins corresponding to  
cellular 
organisms were manually checked (Extended Data Fig. 2a). K-mer-based  
binning 
identified 66 putative novel mVCs from diverse habitat types (freshwater, waste-
water, thermal vents, and marine with IMG sample identifiers 3300000553, 
3300001592, 3300001681, 3300000116, and 3300001450, respectively).
The second approach relied on identification of contigs containing RNA pol-
ymerase with domain composition reminiscent of RNA polymerase (RNAp) 
found in cellular life forms, which could not be placed into one of three domains 
on the tree of life based on their sequence similarity. First, 2,551 representative 
sequences of the genes encoding the three major subunits (α 
, β 
, β 
’) of the RNAp 
gene from bacteria, as well as their eukaryotic and archaeal counterparts, were 
 
collected from IMG database. Next, the domains of these genes were extracted 
using Pfam  
models and aligned with MAFFT49. Alignments were manually 
inspected and HMM  
models were built using hmmbuild50. These models were 
used to scan metagenomic sequences longer than 5 kb and identified 39,109 contigs 
with matches for at least one core RNAp subunit. After filtering short matches and a 
dereplication step, we obtained 7,437 metagenomic sequences that were combined 
with 2,551 reference isolates to build a tree with 9,309 RNAp sequences using 
FastTree52 with default parameters (Extended Data Fig. 2d). The tree was visualized 
using Dendroscope53 and RNAp branch corresponding to large eukaryotic DNA 
viruses was identified on the basis of reference sequences from isolate genomes. 
In addition to eukaryotic viruses, another set of metagenomic RNAp sequences 
branching separately from cellular references, turned out to comprise phage RNAp 
with domain composition similar to bacterial enzyme (detailed in Extended Data 
Fig. 2e). A total of 188 contigs longer than 20 kb containing viral and phage RNAp 
sequences were added to the training set.
Assignment of metagenomic sequences to viruses. The 25,000 viral protein 
 
families were used to identify 125,842 DNA metagenomic viral contigs (mVCs) 
longer than 5 kb using 3 distinct filters. First, mVCs were identified from metagen-
omic contigs that had at least 5 hits to viral protein families, the total number of genes 
covered with KO terms on the contig was < 
20%; the total number of genes covered 
with Pfams ≤ 
40%; and the number of genes covered with viral protein families 
 
> 
10%. Second, metagenomic sequences were selected as mVCs when the number 
of viral protein families on the contig were equal or higher than the number of 
Pfams. Finally, metagenomic contigs for which the number of viral protein families 
was equal or higher than 60% of the total of the genes were also assigned to mVCs. 
Benchmarking and modelling of this DNA viral discovery computational approach 
are detailed below, demonstrating a specificity of 99.6% for viral detection with a 
37.5% recall rate (sensitivity to identify all viral sequences).
Benchmarking of computational approaches for virus detection. In order to 
assess the accuracy of our DNA vHMM virus detection pipeline, we generated a 
synthetic metagenome, consisting of finished genomes of 32 bacteria, 3 archaea 
and 5 viruses (Supplementary Table 2), which included 88 replicons. Bacterial 
genomes include representatives of 4 phyla. A total of 132 prophage sequences 
were  
identified including 99 prophages identified by CyVerse54 implementation of 
VirSorter55 in the categories 1, 2, 4, and 5, and 33 prophages identified by manual 
curation based on the presence of hallmark phage genes and analysis of synteny 
with closely related strains. Coordinates of 35 prophages predicted by VirSorter 
had to be manually adjusted to eliminate bacterial genes (including ribosomal 
RNAs and other housekeeping genes) and to separate 2 prophage sequences called 
as one prophage over an intervening stretch of bacterial genes. Coordinates of 
the prophages are provided in Supplementary Table 3. None of the viruses or 
prophages used in the synthetic metagenome were included in the training set 
used to  
generate viral HMMs for our pipeline.
The genome sequences were fragmented to generate 63,222 contigs of length 
5 kb to 60 kb. The distribution of fragmented contigs include 28,497 5-kb-long

fragments, 14,228 10-kb-long fragments, 7,096 20-kb-long fragments, 4,723 
30-kb-long fragments, 3,525 40-kb-long fragments, 2,810 50-kb-long fragments 
and 2,343 60-kb-long fragments. The resulting synthetic metagenome is dominated 
 
by bacterial and archaeal chromosomal fragments with an admixture of a relatively 
small number of plasmid and viral sequences, which is a faithful representation 
of a typical metagenome data set generated by an untargeted approach rather 
than by targeted virome sequencing approach. The metagenome was submitted 
to a CyVerse implementation of VirSorter and also processed by our vHMM 
 
pipeline. Only the categories 1, 2, 4 and 5 of Virsorter predictions were  
considered, 
as manual inspection showed that categories 3 and 6 contained mostly false 
 
positives. Sequence fragments with at least 3 kb of phage or prophage sequence 
were considered as true positive viral sequences; those with less than 3 kb of phage 
or prophage sequence were considered true negative.
Calculating the rate of viral protein cluster accumulation and the number of 
proteins with high similarity to proteins encoded by isolate viruses. The 125,842 
metagenomic viral contigs longer than 5 kb encoded a total of 2.79 million proteins. 
BLASTp56 with an e-value of 1.0 × 10−5 was used and 1 hit per query protein with 
> 
60% sequence identity and > 
80% alignment on the shorter sequence. Proteins 
encoded by mVCs were clustered using CD-HIT57 at 60% sequence identity and 
> 
80% alignment on the shorter sequence. For each sample count, 100 random 
metagenome sets were generated and the total number of protein clusters found 
on the contigs from this set was calculated. This analysis was repeated separately 
for metagenome samples classified as ‘aquatic’ (n = 656) and ‘human’ (n = 673).
Comparison of mVCs protein clusters against all iVGs. Sequence  
similarity 
of mVCs to iVGs was computed using BLASTp56 with an e-value threshold 
of 1.0 × 
 10−5 and alignment length of at least 80% of the shorter protein. No 
 
percentage identity or bit-score cutoffs were applied (Supplementary Table 9).
Identification of complete metagenomic viral genomes. To assess the number 
of closed DNA mVCs, we searched for overlapping sequences in the 3′ 
 and 5′ 
region of all the 125,842 metagenomic contigs. Extractseq58 was used to trim the 
first 100 bp of each contig and BLAT59 was used to search each 100-bp fragment 
against the respective contig. Only exact overlapping matches for both the 3′ 
 and 5′ 
regions were considered. This resulted in the identification of 999 putatively closed 
mVCs, ranging from 5,037 bp to 630,638 bp in length (average, 53,644 bp ± 
 45,677 
bp s.d.). Supplementary Table 10 lists all putatively closed mVCs.
Viral genome clustering and designation of viral groups. A sequence-based 
classification framework was developed for systematically linking closely related 
viral genomes based on their overall protein similarity. The framework relies on 
both AAI and total alignment fraction (AF) for pairwise comparisons of viral 
sequences, and enables natural grouping of related iVGs and mVCs. The 125,842 
mVCs were combined with all iVGs (DNA and RNA viruses) for the generation of 
the viral group classification framework (Supplementary Information). To reduce 
the number of the AAI comparisons, only mVCs that  
contained at least one pro-
tein match with ≥ 
70% identity across ≥ 
50% of the  
shortest protein length were 
selected for pairwise computations. This filter reduced the number of total pairwise 
comparisons from 9.5 billion to 15.9  
million. The bidirectional average amino acid 
identity (AAI) was performed as  
previously described18 for all of the 15.9 million 
pairwise comparisons. This method  
implements usearch47 for rapid blast, and 
selects the bidirectional best hit for each protein encoded on the mVC and outputs 
the AAI and the AF. The output was subsequently filtered to include only matches 
that had ≥ 
90% AAI and ≥ 
50% AF which were the observed parameters that best 
reproduced the existing taxonomy of iVGs (Supplementary Information; Extended 
Data Fig. 5a). The high-quality filtered AAI results were then clustered using 
 
single-linkage hierarchical clustering and visualized in Cytoscape60 (Extended 
Data Fig. 5c–e).
Validation of viral groups generated. As a validation of our clustering method we 
observed that 87% of the iVGs (920 out of the 1,060 viral groups or singletons) with 
a taxonomic assignment according to the International Committee on Taxonomy 
of Viruses (ICTV) clustered in agreement with the ICTV-designated species. All 
the remaining 13% of iVGs clustered at the genus-level. From this 13% (represented 
by 140 viral groups that contain at least one iVG) we found that only 49 were phage 
groups, with high pairwise (over 90% AAI) values for the reference viruses within 
each group, suggesting that despite their taxonomic assignments, they were also 
probably members of the same species (Supplementary Table 14). These analyses 
show that our viral groups are taxonomically relevant and provide a useful method 
for organizing distinct viral types.
Viral host assignment using the CRISPR–Cas system. A CRISPR–Cas spacer 
database of 3.5 million sequences was created using a modified version of the 
CRISPR Recognition Tool61 (CRT) detailed in ref. 44 against 40,623 isolates and 
6,714 metagenomes (all data sets from the IMG system as of 9 July 2015). All 
identified spacers were queried for exact sequence matches against all iVGs using 
the BLASTn-short function from the BLAST+ package with parameters: e-value 
threshold of 1.0 × 
 10−10, percentage identity of 95%, and using 1 as a maximum 
 
target sequence56. 98.5% of the detected 1,340 spacer hits were to a putative 
 
bacterial or archaeal host whose taxonomic assignment was in  
agreement at the 
species or genus level with the existing viral taxonomy (Supplementary Table 18). 
From the remaining matches, 1.2% of the hits agreed at the family level and only 
0.3% of the spacers (2 cases where Pseudomonas spacers matched a Rhodothermus 
phage, and Methylomicrobium spacers that matched Pseudomonas and Burkholderia 
phage) were above family, validating our approach of host assignment based on 
CRISPR–Cas spacer matches. Subsequently, all 3.5 million spacers were compared 
against the 125,842 mVCs, requiring at least 95% identity over the whole spacer 
length, and allowing only 1–2 SNPs at the 5′ 
 end of the sequence. A total of 12,576 
proto-spacers (that is, spacer sequences within a phage genome) were identified. 
Based on CRISPR–Cas spacer matches exclusively from microbial isolate genomes 
we assigned host taxonomy to 8,084 mVCs (representing 6.42% of all the mVCs), 
comprising 826 viral groups (~ 
4.47% of the total) plus 1,100 viral singletons 
 
(~ 
1.71%) (Fig. 2a; Supplementary Table 19).
Host–virus assignment using viral tRNA matches. Identification of tRNAs from 
mVCs was performed with ARAGORN v1.2 (ref. 62) using the ‘-t’ option. In order to 
validate this approach, 2,181 tRNA sequences were recovered from 344 referenced 
 
viruses (~ 
7% of the total). These were compared against all genomes and 
 
metagenomes in the IMG system using BLAST, leading to 16,089 perfect hits (100% 
length and 100% sequence identity) after removing self-hits and duplicates. The 
taxonomic assignment of the tRNAs found in iVGs was compared against the 
taxonomic information of the isolate microbial genomes showing that 92.5% of 
the matches agreed at the genus or species level (Supplementary Table 18). After 
culling the top-20 most abundant viral-tRNA sequences (sequences conserved 
across members of the gammaproteobacteria class; Supplementary Table 22) and 
repeating the above steps with mVCs, 32,449 tRNAs within 9,555 mVCs (7.6% out 
of the 125,842 total) were identified, enabling the host assignment for 2,527 mVCs 
(Supplementary Information; Supplementary Table 19).
Low abundance virus detection. In order to detect the presence of any of the 
mVCs in lower abundances across different habitat types, we expanded our  
analysis 
to include not only assembled data (that probably represent the most abundant 
viruses) but also unassembled data from 4,169 samples currently  
available 
in IMG/M database, which comprises more than 5 Tb of sequences. We used 
BLASTn program in the Blast+ 
 package56 to find hits to our 125,842 predicted 
viral sequences with an e-value cutoff of 1 × 
 10−50, at least 90% identity, and the 
hits from the sample covering at least 10% of the length of the viral contig. This 
filtering of BLAST results excluded matches to short highly conserved fragments 
of viral sequences, such as tRNAs, and other spurious hits. Our filtering crite-
ria were optimized for the type of metagenome data sets available to us, and are 
 
significantly more stringent than those used in some previous studies for similar 
data (e.g. 95% identity over 75 nt alignment used in ref. 63) or tBLASTx with 
e-value of 1.0 × 10−5 recommended by ref. 64. However, it was less stringent than 
the 75% coverage used in the analysis of Tara Oceans Viromes3, which relied on 
viral enrichment to increase viral sequence coverage. For the largest metagenome 
available to us (IMG taxon 3300002568, Grasslands soil microbial communities 
from Hopland, California, USA), this new analysis was able to detect 500 nt of viral 
sequence in 138,769,704,035 nt of total metagenome sequence, which corresponds 
to the abundance of 3.06 × 10−07%.
Habitat type specificity of predicted viral sequences based on their BLASTn hits 
in assembled and unassembled data shows their presence even at low abundance, 
depending on the sequence coverage for each specific metagenome (Fig. 4a, b). 
The distribution of less abundant viruses supports the trend that viruses have a 
strong specificity for a particular habitat type since ~ 
84% of all the viral groups are 
found exclusively in a single habitat type. About 14% of the viral groups were found 
in 2 habitat types, and most of these cases could be explained by the uncertainty 
of habitat type classification. For instance, algae-associated microbiomes were 
classified as plant host-associated and shared viral groups with marine samples, 
whereas loose soil samples classified as terrestrial habitat type shared viral groups 
with rhizosphere samples, which were classified as plant host-associated. After 
excluding ambiguously classified cases, most viral groups detected in more than 
1 habitat type were found in the samples from the same environmental category 
 
(for example,  in different aquatic habitats or in different mammalian hosts). We 
further report the finding of ~ 
0.2% of the viral groups in 5 or more habitats types 
and discuss the main types of these ‘cosmopolitan’ viruses (probably laboratory 
 
contaminants, prophages with broad-host specificity, and bona fide lytic phages 
with unexpectedly broad habitat type distribution).

using rqcfilter tool from BBtools package (https://sourceforge.net/projects/
bbtools/) with default settings: kmer length for trimming of 23, minimum average 
quality of 5, trim quality threshold of 10, reads shorter than 45 nt after trimming 
were discarded. Quality-filtered and trimmed reads were digitally normalized and 
error corrected using bbnorm tool from BBtools package with default settings. 
Normalized reads were assembled using SPADES 3.6.2 (ref. 65) and kmers of 19, 
39, 59, 79, 99, selecting an optimal kmer length based on the maximal N50. Average 
contig and scaffold coverage of assembled data was calculated by mapping the 
quality-filtered and -trimmed reads to the assembly using bbmap tool from BBtools 
with default kmer length of 13 and minimum percentage identity cutoff of 95%. 
The unmapped reads were merged using bbmerge tool from BBtools package and 
the sequences shorter than 100 nt were discarded. mVCs were aligned against these 
data using BLASTn and filtered as described above. Only 1 best hit per sequence 
was retained. Coverage of each mVC by sample data was calculated as alignment 
length multiplied by the coverage of the subject sequence and summed over all 
sequences in the sample with hits to this mVC.
Putative prophage identification. We have identified putative prophages among 
125,842 mVCs using these contigs as a query and running BLASTn56 comparison of 
‘blast+ 
’ package against all isolate genomes in the IMG database. e-value cutoff of 
1.0 × 
 10−50 and percentage identity of 80% were used, and mVCs with cumulative 
alignment of at least 75% of mVC length against an isolate genome were considered 
prophage candidates (Supplementary Table 4).
Global virus distribution maps. Visualization was made with the use of 
Processing programming language (https://processing.org/) and a freely  
available 
equirectangular projection of the world map (http://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/
images/imagerecords/57000/57752/land_shallow_topo_2048.jpg) was used 
as a  
background image. Sample points are positioned by latitude and longitude 
coordinates of Biosamples obtained from GOLD5. Points are coloured based on 
a customized reclassification of the GOLD hierarchical ecosystem classification 
(habitat types). Lines between points indicate samples that share at least 2 viral 
groups or singletons.

Extended Data Figure 1 | Detailed workflow for the identification of 
viral sequences from metagenomic data. a, Overview of the acquisition 
and filtering of viral protein families in two rounds and their use for the 
identification of metagenomic viral contigs larger than 5 kb. In the first 
round, proteins from 2,300 double-stranded DNA viruses were grouped 
into 16,000 protein families, which were aligned to generate Hidden 
Markov Models (HMMs). These HMMs were used in combination 
with analysis of k-mer composition and phylogenetic analysis of DNA-
dependent RNA polymerase genes to identify 1,843 high-confidence 
metagenome viral contigs. b, c, These contigs were validated by manual 
analysis (b) and the proteins from this set were combined with the isolate 
viral proteins to generate a final set of 25,000 viral protein families (c).  
d, HMMs generated from alignment of these protein families were used to 
identify 125,842 metagenomic viral contigs. Processing steps detailed in 
b–d are described in the Methods. The final mVCs were then grouped and 
assigned to their hosts via CRISPR–Cas spacer matches and viral tRNA 
matches against isolate microbes (not shown in this figure).

Extended Data Figure 2 | Identification of metagenomic viral contigs 
via binning and DNA-dependent RNA polymerase alignment.  
a–c, Three distinct metagenomic examples of tetranucleotide Emergent 
Self Organizing Maps (ESOM) as a binning method for identification 
of candidate viral sequences in metagenome data sets. Tetranucleotide 
binning of metagenomic samples (full list in Supplementary Table 1) 
was used to identify highly divergent viral sequences, which were left 
undetected using viral protein families generated from isolate viruses. 
Each dot on the maps represents a 10 kb fragment of a metagenomic 
scaffold longer than 20 kb. ‘Bubbles’ (ESOM structures) correspond to 
fragments with similar tetranucleotide composition probably originating 
from the same genome. Red dots represent viral sequences detected by 
viral protein families generated for isolate viruses; white dots represent 
highly divergent viral sequences with no hits to viral protein families.  
a, ESOM of freshwater sample (combined assembly of freshwater  
microbial communities from Lake Mendota and Trout Bog Lake, IMG 
identifier 3300000553) shows 2 putative viral sequences previously 
unidentified (IMG scaffold identifiers 10001161 and 10001271).  
b, ESOM of marine sample (marine microbial communities from 
Delaware Coast, sample from Delaware MO Spring March 2010, IMG 
identifier 3300000116) shows 2 putative viral sequences sequences (IMG 
scaffold identifiers c10000689 and c10000429). c, ESOM of hydrothermal 
vent sample (black smokers hydrothermal plume microbial communities 
from Abe, Lau Basin, Pacific Ocean, IMG identifier 3300001681) showing 
2 viral sequences (IMG scaffold identifiers 10000222 and 10000095). 
Metagenome samples can be found in IMG using IMG identifiers and 
‘Quick Search’ or ‘Genome Search’ tools; metagenome scaffolds can 
be using scaffold identifier and ‘Scaffold Search’ tool on the respective 
‘Microbiome Details’ page. d, e, DNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes 
of likely viral origin from metagenomic sequences longer than 5 kb.  
d, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) were built for sequences 
corresponding to α 
, β 
, and β 
' subunits of bacterial DNA-dependent RNA 
polymerase for a representative set of 2,551 cellular organisms (archaea, 
bacteria, and eukaryotes) and viruses. These models were used to search 
the proteins encoded by metagenomic contigs longer than 5 kb and the 
proteins with hits were aligned against the HMMs. A total of 7,437 nearly 
full-length metagenomic sequences were combined with 2,551 reference 
sequences to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree using FastTree tool. Two 
distinct branches on this tree were separated from the sequences from 
cellular organisms and included RNA polymerase genes from eukaryotic 
viruses (green box) and putative phage sequences with domain structure 
similar to that of bacterial RNA polymerase (red box, marked with double 
asterisk). Only 122 out of the 400 contigs in the eukaryotic viral RNA 
polymerase branch were captured by isolate protein families. e, Detailed 
view of the RNA polymerase tree branch with putative phage sequences. 
Metagenome contigs detected as viral by viral protein families and by 
spacer hits are marked with a square or circle next to it. Gene structure 
for selected contigs (IMG chromosomal neighbourhood view) is shown 
in the boxes. In the examples, genes are coloured based on predicted 
function category (using Clusters of Orthologous Genes prediction) and 
are specified in the figure. White-coloured genes correspond to those with 
hypothetical or unknown function.

Extended Data Figure 5 | Viral group clustering method. a, Parameters 
used in the clustering of viral sequences. We used all 5,042 reference isolate 
viral genomes (iVGs) to group them using single-linkage hierarchical 
clustering (SLC) with different combinations of AAI and AF values to 
validate the clustering approach. The thresholds for AAI and AF were set 
at 90% and 50%, respectively, (boxed in purple) and were selected based on 
the accurate grouping of iVGs that was in agreement at the genus level, and 
the vast majority at the species level, according to the ICTV classification 
system (Supplementary Information). Further, these thresholds reduced 
the number of total connections (green line referred to secondary y axis) 
compared with lower AAI thresholds, without altering the total number 
of singletons and viral groups created (red and light green bars referred to 
primary y axis, respectively), as well as the average number of members 
per viral group (shown at the bottom of the figure). b, Size distribution 
of viral groups. Distribution of the 66,696 viral genomes clustered into 
18,470 viral groups. Number of viral members (spanning from 2 to 365)

groups. c, Major reference isolated viral groups created using SLC with 
AAI and AF values of 90% and 50%, respectively. Cytoscape force-directed 
(unweighted) layout option was used to visualize these groups. Black 
nodes represent isolated viral genomes whereas orange and green nodes 
represent metagenomic viral contigs clustered with isolates from host-
associated and environmental samples, respectively. Group edges connect 
viral groups based on the above cutoffs. d, The four largest viral groups

were found in the same habitat subtype: human oral samples for vg_2932, 
and human faecal samples for vg_2864 (with a sole exception in the latter 
group that derived from an oral sample, indicated with a red arrow).

resided in a single habitat type (either as a singleton 19.7%, as a viral group 
found in a single sample 1.8%, or as a viral group found in 2 or more 
samples 64.4%), whereas only a small fraction (0.31% of all mVCs) were 
found in 4 or more different habitat types. b, c, Examples of viral groups

Presence of a single viral group across distinct marine samples based on 
average coverage values (red bars; y axis on the left) and total percentage of 
the viral sequence length recovered per sample (purple line; y axis on the 
right). Samples were grouped by marine zones and indicate the percentage

of this zone, preferentially in oxygen minimum zones), but also present 
in twilight, deep ocean, and hydrothermal vent samples. This viral 
group was identified as a SUP05-infecting phage. The genes of the viral 
contig representatives were coloured by the phylogenetic distribution 
of the best hit in the database (white, unknown; green, Proteobacteria;
