Abstract 
Reanalysis models are rapidly gaining popularity for simulating wind power output due to their 
convenience and global coverage.  However, they should only be relied upon once thoroughly 
10 
proven.  This paper reports the first international validation of reanalysis for wind energy, testing 
NASA’s MERRA and MERRA-2 in 23 European countries.  Both reanalyses suffer significant 
spatial bias, overestimating wind output by 50% in northwest Europe and underestimating by 
30% in the Mediterranean.  We derive national correction factors, and show that after calibration 
national hourly output can be modelled with R² above 0.95.  Our underlying data are made freely 
15 
available to aid future research.   
 
We then assess Europe’s wind resources with twenty-year simulations of the current and 
potential future fleets.  Europe’s current average capacity factor is 24.2%, with countries ranging 
from 19.5% (Germany) to 32.4% (Britain).  Capacity factors are rising due to improving technology 
20 
and locations; for example, Britain’s wind fleet is now 23% more productive than in 2005. Based 
on the current planning pipeline, we estimate Europe’s average capacity factor could increase by 
nearly a third to 31.3%.  Countries with large stakes in the North Sea will see significant gains, 
with Britain’s average capacity factor rising to 39.4% and Germany’s to 29.1%.

 1 Introduction 
Energy systems modellers require high resolution time series of power output from national fleets 
of wind farms, as their variable and unpredictable nature poses increasing challenges for the 
world’s electricity systems.  Power systems models such as WeSIM, Plexos and ANTARES, plus 
energy systems models such as TIMES, PRIMES and EnergyPLAN require external data to 
40 
represent the contribution from wind as it cannot be controlled, and is not dispatched according 
to economic or market rationale.  Such data are often difficult to acquire or simulate accurately, 
hindering research in this critical field.   
 
Reanalysis – the output from global atmospheric simulations – is rapidly gaining popularity for 
45 
simulating renewable energy resources due to its convenience and global coverage.  However, as 
with any new technology, using reanalysis to synthesise wind outputs should only be relied upon 
once thoroughly proven.  The prevailing approach within the wind research community is to use 
downscaled models and more detailed terrain data.  Commercial tools such as WaSP, Virtual Met 
Masts, 3TIER and Vortex are widely used within the wind energy community as their results are 
50 
significantly more accurate.  This accuracy comes at the cost of complexity, and thus 
computational resource, intellectual capital and data requirements.  Those in the wider energy 
research community may therefore see value in a simpler method for modelling wind power 
output aggregated to regional or national scales, rather than from individual farms.  We 
demonstrate a technique using reanalysis with no downscaling and very limited wind farm 
55 
characteristics, which is able to represent national fleet output very well across Europe with the 
use of simple correction factors. 
 
In the last decade, wind power has achieved mainstream status and risen to dominate the 
international energy research agenda.  Wind now commands a significant share of the world’s 
60 
electricity supply: global capacity stood at around 350 GW at the start of 2015, and is rising at 
35% per year [1, 2].  Around 135 GW of this is located in Europe, which hosts 87,000 wind 
turbines grouped into 17,000 farms, as mapped in Figure 1.  Wind now comprises 13% of 
installed capacity in Europe (a greater share than nuclear power), and can provide more than the 
entire national demand in five countries, including Germany and Spain.

Figure 2 plots the recent growth in wind capacity against the range of hourly electricity demand in 
selected countries, showing that it is now physically possible for large parts of Europe to be 
completely powered by wind when peak output coincides with minimum demand, if it were not for 
issues with system control (stability, inertia, reserve, etc.).  This figure makes no account for the 
75 
timing of wind output, or its correlation with demand for electricity, but helps to put each 
country’s installed capacity into context.

Countries are referred to by two-letter ISO codes, which are listed in the online supplement.  Demand 
during 2006‒2014 [3] is shown as stacked bars (Q1 and Q3 signify the 1st and 3rd quartiles).  The evolution of 
wind capacity over this period is shown as circles.  The top axis shows the hypothetical maximum 
percentage of demand wind could meet if peak output coincided with minimum demand.  
 
85 
The rapid expansion in capacity has brought with it increased problems due to the variable and 
uncontrollable nature of wind output.  Wind has profound effects on electricity markets: pushing 
down power prices and changing investment patterns [4], increasing the need for infrastructure 
upgrades [5], and forcing countries to increase cooperation between their electricity markets to 
maintain efficiency [6] and security [7]. 
90 
 
The profiles of wind power output need to be understood at regional, national and continental 
scale, but this has traditionally been very difficult.  Research into all aspects of renewable energy 
is reliant on a core foundation: high quality data.  Wind power output is variable and weather-
dependent, with complex correlations over space and time, and against human activity (and thus 
95 
demand for electricity) [8].  Historic data is lacking due to commercial confidentiality, and 
significant time or finance is needed to produce a credible simulation, which poses a significant 
barrier to research across this field. 
 
Conversely, meteorological data is often freely available, but significant time and knowledge is 
100 
required to acquire, understand, process, correct and utilise it.  A recent econometric study into 
wind farm degradation by the Renewable Energy Foundation [9] serves as an important warning: it 
lacked reliable data and any form of validation, but despite its results being widely discredited [10, 
11] it caused significant alarm among press and financial circles [12].

 A recent development that could counter these problems is the use of freely-available reanalysis 
data produced by global weather models assimilating historic observations.  Studies which use 
reanalysis to simulate wind outputs began to proliferate in 2014, but they either consider a broad 
region (Europe, US, China) with no validation against actual output [13-17], or are limited to 
validating in a single country [10, 18-23].   
110 
 
This limits the confidence that can be placed in such studies, which dampens the impressive 
scope of their conclusions.  Most energy systems models rely on exogenous inputs on the level 
and pattern of wind outputs, including the influential TIMES, PRIMES, EnegyPlan and IEA World 
Energy Model.  Many modelling efforts the world over could therefore provide improved results 
115 
and insights by using rigorously validated and calibrated reanalysis data as an input. 
 
This paper provides the first international validation of reanalysis for simulating wind energy, 
drawing on historic data collected from 23 countries in Europe covering the period of 2005 to 
2014.  It shows that reanalysis can be a very powerful tool, simulating national fleet outputs with 
120 
high accuracy and stability; however, this is only possible with a careful calibration, as we expose 
significant spatial bias in the underlying reanalysis data. 
 
The next section introduces reanalysis, bias correction and previous studies in the field.  Section 
3 details our data sources and methods, and then Section 4 presents our Europe-wide validation.  
125 
Section 5 summarises the long-term characteristics of the European wind resource and the rate at 
which capacity factors are improving because of better turbines and site selection.  Section 6 
concludes and considers further applications.

2 Background 
2.1 Synthesising Wind Output Data 
135 
The importance and complexity of wind output means it has been extensively studied over the 
last decade.  Prominent studies include Sinden’s assessment of the UK wind resource [8], the 
Pöyry and TradeWind reports on intermittency and expanding electricity markets [5, 24], and 
studies into the feasibility of highly / fully renewable energy systems by Lu [13], Heide [25], 
Jacobsen [26] and Becker [16], for example. 
140 
 
5 
 Early studies such as Sinden [8] and Pöyry [5] were based on assumed long-run average capacity 
factors and wind speeds from ground-based metrological masts.  These typically give 
observations from 10 metres above ground (much lower than turbine hub heights), and the raw 
data requires substantial cleaning and cross-checking, as downtime is significant and jumps in 
145 
the data are observed when measuring instruments are replaced.  The location of these stations is 
also weighted towards population centres and airports for weather forecasting purposes, leaving 
the locations of wind-farms under-represented. 
 
Within the wind research community, prognostic models such as MM5, RUC and WRF have been 
150 
used to downscale reanalysis data into smaller and more accurate geographical grids [32].  These 
approaches take into account surface parameters such as topography and site-specific land use.  
Such methods are particularly relevant for accurate short-term forecasting of wind power at 
specific sites [32, 33], as their results are significantly more accurate. 
 
155 
However, the downscaling process is costly in terms of time, intellectual capital, computing 
resources and data requirements.  We show that this effort may be unnecessary for some 
applications, as using reanalysis directly with a simple correction factor yields national-scale 
results with high accuracy.  While this is not sufficiently accurate for detailed modelling of site-
specific conditions, it may be relevant to energy systems modellers working at spatially 
160 
aggregated scales, for whom having 20+ years of internally consistent renewable generation is 
valued, and where there are many other and more substantial sources of uncertainty. 
 
More recently, reanalysis datasets have been explored as a means of simulating wind power 
production.  These are the product of an atmospheric model set to match historic weather 
165 
observations, and contain estimated weather parameters on a regular grid, often with global 
coverage, spanning several decades. 
 
The first studies to use reanalysis modelled the power outputs at individual locations in Hungary 
[27] and Northern Ireland [28].  In the last two years, studies have expanded their scope to 
170 
validate models against regional or national aggregate output in the UK [10, 18-20, 23], Denmark 
[21] and Sweden [22].   
 
These studies focus on relatively small and geographically similar areas – coastal countries in 
northern Europe.  Furthermore, many of these studies are validated against wind speeds rather 
175 
than power outputs – neglecting the complexity of transforming from meteorological input to 
electrical output.  Sharp provides a comprehensive overview of recent studies and their validation 
methods [20]. 
 
6 
 Another growing body of literature uses reanalysis to quantify and explore the wind resources of 
180 
regions and countries, but with no effort made to validate the results.  For example: 
• 
Lu estimated the global potential of wind energy, but without validation [13]. 
• 
Gunturu and co-authors characterised the wind resources in the US [29], Europe [14] and 
Australia [30], all apparently without validation. 
• 
Huber simulated wind and solar outputs across Europe, validating the ramping rates 
185 
between hours (i.e. the fine-grain pattern) as opposed to the overall levels [15]. 
• 
Becker et al. simulated 100%-renewable wind and solar mixes in the US [16], but only 
hinted at approximate visual comparison to resource maps as a means of validation. 
• 
McKenna et al. (2015) estimated the levelised cost of wind energy across Europe, 
suggesting that “future work should focus on […] validating estimated potentials with 
190 
outputs from actual wind turbines” [17]. 
 
The results presented by Lu, Cosseron, Huber and McKenna all appear to feature the same 
spatial bias across Europe that we reveal in Section 4.1; most easily identified by capacity factors 
that are unreasonably high in Britain and Northern Germany (30–50%) and unreasonably low in 
195 
Romania (5–15%), Portugal and Spain (10–25%).  We contest that the results of such uncorrected 
studies cannot be relied upon, as the capacity factors derived from uncorrected reanalysis 
models may be out by up to ±50%.

2.2 Reanalysis – A Convenient Source of Weather Data 
Reanalysis combines a system for assimilating historic weather observations with an atmospheric 
circulation model to infer the state of the global weather system.  The model is set to replicate 
historic observations from satellites, ground observatories, ships, aircraft, etc., producing a 
hindcast as opposed to a forecast.  In essence, reanalyses take difficult to use observations, 
205 
apply automated quality control, and transform them into a standardised dataset with uniform and 
complete spatial and temporal coverage [31].  For this reason, reanalyses are widely used for 
commercial applications in the energy sector for understanding the availability of renewable 
resources (wind, solar and hydro). 
 
210 
Several reanalysis products are available, as listed in Table 1.  Wind speeds are most commonly 
available at a fixed height of 10 m above ground, only MERRA and ERA-20C provide other 
heights closer to those used by wind turbines.  Wind speed variables are also available at other 
model heights, usually based on fixed pressure or isothermal levels.  The height of these levels 
above ground is not constant, and often well outside the region of interest (>250 m or <0 m).

A key benefit of reanalyses is that they can infer variables for which there are no observations; for 
example wind speeds at 50 m (met masts are usually only 10 m tall), in locations that are either 
remote or out to sea (where met masts are not present).  This raises a fundamental issue with 
reanalysis data: whilst it is very convenient, it is just the output of a coarse model.  Put simply: 
225 
can it be trusted? 
 
2.3 The Need for Bias Correction 
A key factor with the studies listed in §2.1 is the need for calibration, or bias correction, to bring 
simulated capacity factors in line with reality.  While reanalyses may be able to replicate the 
230 
pattern of output over time, they are not able to accurately assess the overall level of output, or its 
variation over space.  The reasons for this are three-fold [31, 34]: 
1. Reanalyses are less than perfect computer models, and are known to contain systematic 
errors (biasses) due to errors in the underlying weather forecast model; 
2. Their spatial coarseness means they are unable to resolve the detailed topography of a 
235 
particular region, missing out on speed-up and blockage effects; and 
3. The wind speed observations they attempt to replicate are not representative of wind farm 
sites, being primarily inferred from satellite data, and ground observations from short met 
masts. 
 
240 
Stickler notes that “while reproducing quite well the interannual variability, reanalysis products 
have been found to contain major biases” [35].  Decker adds that “at monthly time scales, the 
8 
 bias terms in reanalysis products are the dominant source of mean-square errors, as opposed to 
the correlation term which becomes the dominant source at hourly time scales” [36].   
245 
The bias in wind speeds appears to have received little attention, as the primary focus has been 
on temperature and precipitation [35, 36].  However, errors in wind speed are typically as 
significant as those for temperature and precipitation, and worse than those for surface irradiance 
[36].  The wind speeds from several reanalyses exhibited biases in the region of 2–4 m/s relative 
to 33 North American meteorological masts [36], which can translate to the difference between a 
250 
20% and 80% capacity factor for a typical wind turbine as output is so sensitive to wind speed. 
Statistical methods for bias correction are widely used in climate modelling to bring the frequency 
distribution of modelled outputs into line with historic observations [37, 38].  Several methods of 
bias correction are employed, ranging in complexity from additive and linear scale factors to 
255 
quantile mapping [39, 40].   
Previous studies which use reanalysis for wind energy use simple statistical calibrations which 
have been derived for small geographic regions.  Model calibration takes either the form of a 
formula-driven reduction in wind speeds [22, 23, 41-43], an empirical regression to adjust the 
260 
shape of the power curve [18, 21, 24] or post-processing to adjust energy output [44]. 
In the UK and Denmark, observed capacity factors are 26–32% lower than those estimated from 
uncorrected reanalyses [10, 21, 42], and for offshore farms in the North Sea they are 12–15% 
lower [23, 41].  To correct for this, previous studies have reduced wind speeds by 1.2–1.3 m/s [21, 
265 
41].  Such calibration factors have not been produced for other countries, and the underlying 
trends in them are not known. 
The hourly wind speeds from reanalyses cannot be relied on to predict the long-run average 
capacity factor for a given location.  It therefore follows that these models cannot be used over a 
270 
wider region (e.g. Europe, China, India) or globally without prior calibration.  We provide the first 
such calibration for Europe.

 3 Methods 
275 
3.1 The Virtual Wind Farm Model 
The Virtual Wind Farm (VWF) model was used for this study, which is described in [10] and 
validated for Great Britain in [23] and [45].  It takes hourly wind speed data from NASA’s MERRA 
[46] and MERRA-2 [47] reanalyses, chosen for their ease of access, good spatial and temporal 
resolution and stability over long time-scales [48]. 
280 
As illustrated in Figure 3, the VWF model: 
(a) acquires wind speeds at 2, 10 and 50 metres above ground at each MERRA grid point; 
(b) interpolates speeds to the specific geographic coordinates of each wind farm using 
LOESS regression; 
285 
(c) extrapolates speeds to the hub height of the turbines at each site using the logarithm 
profile law; and then 
(d) converts speeds to power outputs using manufacturers’ power curves, which are 
smoothed to represent a farm of several geographically dispersed turbines.  
290 
A fuller mathematical description is given in the online supplement §4.

the VWF methodology.

 The model applies a smoothing transform to the turbine power curve in stage (d) to account for 
there being a distribution of wind speeds within any given hour, and between the individual 
295 
turbines of a geographically dispersed farm.  Rather than using a static pre-defined curve such as 
those given by National Grid [18] or TradeWind [24], we use a Gaussian filter that can be applied 
to the power curve for any model of turbine.  The width of this filter (σ) is a function of wind speed 
(w): 
σ = 0.6 + 0.2 w m/s 
1 
300 
to capture the increase in spatial and temporal variation at high wind speeds.  The parameters we 
use in Equation 1 were determined empirically to give the best representation of historic output. 
3.2 Wind Speed Bias Correction 
In a departure from pure meteorological studies such as [36], we measure bias in terms of the 
305 
derived power output from wind farms rather than the wind speeds which are directly taken from 
the reanalysis.  This reflects the assumption that power output is the important metric for energy 
systems modellers.  We then apply our corrections to the underlying wind speeds, assuming that 
the fundamental error lies in the wind speeds rather than the method of converting them to 
output.  Correcting the wind speeds also avoids implausible results, such as scaling up the 
310 
simulated CFs to over 100%. 
The bias, or systematic error (εCF), for a country is defined as the ratio of observed to simulated 
capacity factors: 
εCF  =  
CFobs
CFsim
2 
315 
We calculate εCF at the national level due to data availability, as individual farm or turbine outputs 
are only published for Britain [10], Finland [49], Germany and Denmark [50].  We therefore assume 
that all farms within a country experience the same bias, except where countries have both 
onshore and offshore capacity. 
320 
Previous work has shown that the value of εCF is between 9% and 23% higher for offshore than 
for onshore farms in Britain [23, 41].  The spatial coarseness of current reanalyses cannot account 
for local terrain, trees and buildings which may obstruct the flow of air on land, reducing CFobs and 
thus εCF.  This is less of an issue out to sea, and so for offshore farms we assume the relevant 
country’s bias should be multiplied by 1.16, the average of the above two findings.  We derive 
325 
separate bias values for onshore and offshore farms �εCF
on  and εCF
off � such that their average when
weighted by the amount of onshore and offshore capacity �Qon and Qoff� yields the overall bias
calculated for that country (εCF): 
11 
 Qon εCF
on   +   Qoff εCF
off   =  �Qon + Qoff�  εCF    where   εCF
off   =  1.16 εCF
on  
3 
 
330 
For example, MERRA predicts an average CF of 39.2% in Britain compared to the 29.0% that has 
been observed over the period 2005–14.  Therefore εCF = 0.74 which is notably higher than 
previous findings for Britain’s onshore fleet: 0.69 [42], 0.69 [43] and 0.68 [10].  When averaged 
over our validation period (2005–2015) 73% of Britain’s capacity has been onshore and 27% 
offshore.  When this is applied to the above formula, we find εCF
on  = 0.70 and εCF
off  = 0.82; which is 
335 
more consistent with previous findings.  We therefore assume that the uncorrected CF should be 
reduced by 30% for each onshore farm in Britain, and by 18% for each offshore farm. 
 
To correct this bias, we derive a time series of modified wind speeds (w') such that the energy 
yield (and thus the CF) resulting from these speeds equals the expected value: 
340 
 
P�w'� = εCF P�w'�   where   P(w')
������� = CFsim   and   P(w')
������� = CFobs

Here, the function P represents the conversion from wind speed to capacity factor (stage d in 
Figure 3), and the mean value of P over our validation period yields the values of CF we report.  P 
depends on the power curve for the specific turbine being modelled, and is defined numerically 
345 
rather than analytically.   
 
Wind speeds are corrected using both a multiplicative factor (α) and a linear offset (β m/s):  
 
w' = α w + β 
5 
 
350 
This correction scheme was previously found to give the best replication of historic outputs in the 
UK [23, 45], as using two parameters allows both the level and the variability of CF to be 
controlled.  One parameter used alone could exaggerate or dampen the variability of wind 
speeds, inadvertently impacting the diurnal and seasonal trends.   
 
355 
One approach would be to find specific values of α and β for each country that minimise the error 
in seasonal or hourly CF, or the distribution of CF.  For the sake of simplicity, and to reduce the 
likelihood of over-fitting our model, we instead define a value for α for each country based on the 
observed bias: 
 
360 
α = 0.6εCF + 0.2 
6 
 
This simplicity allows our bias correction process to be applied to countries where only the long-
run average observed CF is known, and still yields a good compromise for representing the 
seasonal and hourly variability across the countries of Europe. 
12 
 365 
The wind speeds at each farm are multiplied by α, and then the model seeks the value of β for 
each farm that yields the desired CF.  These values must be site-specific as they depend on the 
distribution of wind speeds and the model of turbine installed (which determines the function P).  
As there is a monotonic relationship between wind speed and power output under normal 
conditions (i.e. w < 25 m/s), β is found through a simple iterative search. 
370 
In every country, this results in a scale factor of α<100% and an offset of β>0, fitting with 
Decker’s observation that reanalyses “have a strong tendency to overestimate the variability in the 
wind” [36].  For example, the average calibration for British wind farms is w' = 0.66 w + 2.64 m/s, 
the values for other countries are given in the online supplement §2.2.  The impossible situation of 
375 
negative wind speeds is avoided as β is always positive. 
3.3 Historic Wind Output Data 
Validation requires historic output data from wind farms, which is generally difficult to acquire due 
to commercial sensitivities.  Two kinds of accuracy are important: the ability to predict the level of 
380 
output at different locations (spatial accuracy) and the timing of that output to hourly or better 
resolution (temporal accuracy).  The ideal data set for testing both simultaneously would consist 
of high-frequency observations from individual turbines across the whole continent of Europe for 
several years.  Such data does not exist outside the industry, and so we performed two phases of 
validation: first using monthly and annual data from 23 countries (wide geographic coverage); and 
385 
then using hourly data from selected countries (high temporal resolution).  
3.3.1 Data with Wide Geographic Coverage 
Data on national annual energy output and installed capacity were collected for the period 2005 to 
2014 from EuroStat [51], ENTSO-E [3], EurObserv’er [52] and BP [53].  EuroStat data for 2014 
390 
were not available at the time of writing; and for thirteen countries the ENTSO-E monthly output 
data were only available from 2010 onwards.  All ENTSO-E outputs were reduced by 5% to 
account for transmission and distribution losses, bringing their averages into line with the other 
three sources [54].  Further details on these data, their processing, and a comparison between 
sources are given in the online supplement §1.1. 
395 
Energy output was reported as the sum over a year whereas capacity was a snapshot at points in 
time.  When combining these to estimate CF we assume that capacity grows at a constant rate 
during each year.  The average capacity factor (CF) for a year (y) was estimated from total energy 
output over the course of the year (Ey) and the geometric mean of the installed capacity at the 
400 
start of the year (Py) and the start of the following year (Py+1) as in equation 7.

E2014
�P2014 × P2015

E2014

) / 2 
7 
 
For example, wind power in Finland produced 1,124 GWh during 2014, during which capacity 
grew from 428 to 611 MW [53]; if the year-start or the year-end capacity were used in isolation we 
405 
would estimate CF = 30.0% or 21.0%, using the year-average capacity estimate of 511 MW we 
yield CF = 25.1%, which is in keeping with data from previous years.   
 
The long-run average capacity factors for 23 countries are shown in Figure 4, averaged over the 
four sources.  Their estimates for the Europe-wide average CF, weighted by each country’s 
410 
installed capacity, lie in the range of 22.3–22.6%.  Agreement between the sources is generally 
good for countries with established wind sectors (DE, DK, ES, FR, GB), but begins to break down 
for the more recent entrants (GR, HU, RO), as shown later in Figure 6.

3.3.2 Data with High Temporal Resolution 
Nationally aggregated wind output data with hourly or better resolution were acquired from 
system operators in the 8 countries listed in Table 2, covering 72% of Europe’s installed wind 
420 
capacity.  Data files were downloaded from operator’s websites where available, and in some 
cases Flash-based graphs of output were reverse-engineered to recover the underlying data 
values.  These data series were converted to Greenwich Mean Time and aggregated to hourly 
resolution centred on half past each hour, for compatibility with MERRA and MERRA-2.

With the exception of France, these sources only gave power output with no corresponding data 
on the amount of capacity being monitored.  In some countries, this capacity differed significantly 
430 
from the values obtained in the previous section, as not all farms are monitored by the system 
operators.  We therefore estimate the evolution of capacity over time using the start and 
retirement dates for individual farms from [1], and infer the percentage of this capacity that was 
monitored by aligning the resulting CFs with those from the four sources used in the previous 
section.  The final column of Table 2 gives our estimate for the monitored capacity as of January 
435 
2015, in GW and as a percentage of the total fleet. 
3.4 Simulations Performed 
In this study, we simulate the hourly capacity factors from both the current and planned future 
wind fleets in Europe, aggregated to national level.  We note that capacity factors are influenced 
440 
by the models of turbine installed, and so they may differ between countries because of location 
and available wind resource, and also because of their relative approaches to policy, markets, 
subsidy, planning constraints, etc.  The latter will not influence the bias correction factors we 
derive, as we simulating the specific mix of turbine models installed in each country. 
445 
3.4.1 The Current European Wind Fleet 
For validation and assessing the long-term wind resource we simulated all of the wind farms in 
Europe over 1 MW with known latitude and longitude data, which amounted to 8,736 wind farms 
and 110 GW of capacity (82% of Europe’s total).   Simulations were performed using both 
MERRA and MERRA-2 wind speed data, but after finding no material differences between the two 
450 
(as reported in the next section) we focussed on the MERRA simulation, as this is the more widely 
recognised and understood reanalysis.   
15 
  
Of the 360 models of wind turbine employed in Europe, we collected manufacturers’ power 
curves for the 100 most popular, representing 81% of installed capacity.  The remaining turbines 
455 
were assigned to the most similar model based on the age of the turbine model and the power 
density (peak output divided by swept area – W/m²), as in [10].  
 
The tower height was not known for 62% of farms, and so was estimated using a regression of 
known heights against the logarithm of turbine capacity and the date of installation.  The start 
460 
date was not known for 16% of farms, and so was inferred from other farms in the same country 
with turbines of the same capacity.  Having to estimate input parameters for such large portions 
of the installed fleet is a potential source of error, so we note that the model validation may be 
improved with better knowledge of the turbine population. 
 
465 
Each farm was simulated over the 20-year period from 1995–2014, to give a long-term view on 
the average statistics the current fleet would give.  MERRA data is available going back to 1979; 
however, we choose not to use the earlier years as fewer meteorological observations were 
available to assimilate into the reanalysis, potentially compromising its accuracy. 
 
470 
When validating for the period 2005–14, the output from each farm was zeroed at times when it 
did not exist (before its start and after its retirement date), so that the time-evolution of each 
country’s wind fleet was correctly represented.  Later on, Section 4.2 highlights the importance of 
simulating the evolving fleet of farms (i.e. only those that were available in 2005 when estimating 
2005 capacity factors) as opposed to a static snapshot.  The simulation was performed on a 
475 
standard workstation and required around 2,000 gigabytes of storage for input data and 1,200 
CPU-hours (at 3.4 GHz) to complete. 
 
The simulation results were aggregated to country level, and are available to download from 
www.renewables.ninja.. 
480 
 
3.4.2 The Future Wind Fleet 
In addition to modelling Europe’s current fleet, we consider two possible snapshots of Europe’s 
future wind fleet.  For the ‘near-term’ future, we group together farms that have been built during 
2015 (312 farms, 6.5 GW), those that are under construction as of December 2015 (227 farms, 8.8 
485 
GW) and those which have obtained legal approval (75 farms, 29.2 GW).  For the ‘long-term’ 
future, we add farms that are at various pre-approval stages in planning pipeline (237 farms, 93.4 
GW).  In total, the near-term fleet contains 150 GW and the long-term fleet 248 GW of capacity, 
which are broken down by country in Table S1 of the online supplement. 
 
490 
16 
 We do not attempt to estimate when these farms will come online, and so do not attribute a date 
to these snapshots.  We also assume that all of the current fleet remains online, with no attempt 
made to estimate which existing farms may retire or be repowered in the coming years.  Note also 
that we ignore any effects of ageing (as explored in [10]), and assume that the average age of 
wind turbines in each country remains constant over time. 
495 
The list of speculative farms were taken from [1], and while it may not be completely exhaustive, it 
ought to give a representative view of the evolution in Europe’s capacity, based on developers’ 
current intentions. 
500 
The ‘near-term’ fleet represents a 36% increase in capacity from the ‘current’ fleet  and the ‘long-
term’ fleet represents a further 65% increase.  Figure 5 shows the geographic distribution of these 
new farms against the backdrop of Europe’s current capacity, highlighting the increasing 
prominence of the North and Baltic Seas.  The move towards offshore farms is evident: 7.5% of 
current capacity (pre-2015) is offshore, rising to 26% of recently built capacity (during 2015), and 
505 
38% of the capacity currently under construction. All of the capacity that is approved or planned 
is offshore, although this is limited by data availability. 
Figure 5: Summary of the near-term and long-term future European wind fleets considered in this study. 
510 
Understandably, a significant portion of these future farms were missing meta-data.  Using the 
same processes as in the previous section, tower heights were inferred for 86% of farms.  Turbine 
models also had to be inferred for 54% of farms, based on the turbine capacity and manufacturer 
(if known).   For each turbine capacity, missing models were drawn randomly from the population 
of known models of that capacity.  Power curves were not available for many of the largest

 prototype turbines, such as the Siemens SWT-7.0-154, so these were matched to known curves 
based on power density (as above). 
 
These fleets were simulated using bias-corrected wind speeds, which were derived from the 
current wind fleet.  It is reasonable to assume that MERRA’s performance and bias when 
520 
simulating future onshore farms should be comparable to the current onshore fleet, as their 
locations are similar.  The same cannot be said for the offshore farms in new areas, deep into the 
North and Baltic Seas, as validation against metered output data is not possible.  However, [41] 
and [10] show that MERRA replicates offshore wind speeds recorded on oil rigs and buoys with 
greater accuracy than onshore speeds. Sharp’s review of 16 reanalysis studies reports similar or 
525 
slightly better correlations, root mean square (RMS) errors and biases for offshore than for 
onshore studies [20]. 
 
4 Validation 
This section first looks at the bias present in the long-run estimates of capacity factors from 
530 
MERRA and MERRA-2.  We derive a set of bias correction factors for each EU country, and then 
compare the estimated power outputs from the corrected MERRA dataset to historic data. 
MERRA-2 is not considered further in this paper, as we find only minimal differences between the 
MERRA and MERRA-2 wind speeds, other than those in MERRA-2 being systematically lower.  
For completeness, the validation for MERRA-2 is presented in the online supplement §2.3 
535 
onwards.  
 
4.1 Bias in National Capacity Factors 
Figure 6 compares the national average capacity factors estimated from the uncalibrated MERRA 
and MERRA-2 data with two previous reanalysis studies (Huber [15], and McKenna [17]) and 
540 
historic statistics.  The MERRA and MERRA-2 capacity factors were reduced to 85% to bring 
them in line with the two previous works.  This gave EU-average capacity factors (weighted by 
national installed capacity) of 22.4% from MERRA and 21.0% from MERRA-2, compared with 
22.5% [15] and 23.1% [17], and 22.4% from historical sources. 
 
545 
We find that reanalysis shows little spatial correlation with historic data across Europe, with R² 
values across countries of just 0.19 for MERRA and 0.15 for MERRA-2, compared with 0.32 in 
[15] and 0.08 in [17].  The RMS errors range from 6.4‒7.2 percentage points.  The fact that this is 
evident in previous works employing MERRA and ERA-Interim suggests that that the problem lies 
in the underlying reanalysis wind speed data rather than the specific methodology used in the 
550 
VWF model.  This sadly casts doubt on the many previous studies that have used reanalysis to 
simulate renewable energy resources without prior calibration. 
18 
 Figure 6: Long-run average capacity factors (2005‒14) given by historic statistics (as bars), compared to 
reanalysis models without bias-correction (lines). 
555 
Historical sources suggest that the national CFs across Europe range from 18.4% up to 29.0%. 
The three reanalysis models exaggerate this spatial variation, ranging from minima of 12.1–13.9% 
up to maxima of 36.7–40.2%. 
We derive bias correction factors for the EU countries from the unweighted average of the four 
560 
historic sources, taking the broadest view of the available data with no judgement on which is 
best.  These corrections are presented in Figure 7, showing the multiplier that must be applied to 
the raw MERRA (left) and MERRA-2 (right) outputs to yield the historic average capacity factors.

 While the national correction factors are relatively stable over time, across space they have a 
standard deviation of ±32%, signifying large heterogeneous bias over a relatively small portion of 
the world’s surface (~2%).  The correction factors for MERRA fit reasonably with previous findings 
in the literature: 68–74% for the UK and Denmark [10, 21, 42, 43].  Critically we find that these 
570 
previously-known scale factors cannot be applied elsewhere across continental Europe.  The 
correction factors for MERRA-2 are the first we know of, and have a similar structure to those for 
MERRA, albeit around 10% higher.  
 
Two approximate trends are evident: a north/south divide separated by the Pyrenees and Alps; 
575 
and an inland/coastal divide between those countries which border the North, Baltic and Celtic 
seas, and those which do not.  We make tentative suggestions for the causes for this 
phenomenon in our conclusions, and signpost this as an interesting avenue for further research. 
 
 
580 
4.2 Inter-annual Variability 
In keeping with previous studies of other weather variables, we find that although MERRA 
contains significant spatial biases, the inter-annual variability within each country is well 
replicated.  The historical sources show a marked variation from one another, making a 
quantitative assessment of MERRA’s accuracy difficult.  Figure 8 shows Denmark as an example, 
585 
the thin coloured lines represent the four data sources we use, which at times follow each other 
precisely (implying the shared use of a common source) but at other times differ substantially 
(ENTSO-E in particular).

 When matching historic outputs, it is necessary to simulate only the farms which existed at any 
595 
given time, as opposed to simulating a static snapshot of installed capacity over the whole period.  
To illustrate this, the dotted line in Figure 8 (VWF Static) shows the simulated output of the current 
2015 fleet of farms, which would have produced a 28.2% capacity factor during 2005 if they had 
existed back then.  In comparison, the dashed line shows represents the “fleet of the day”: the 
farms that were actually operating in 2005 would have produced a 24.5% capacity factor during 
600 
2005, which is much closer to reality.  This effect is strongest in Denmark and the UK due to the 
strong shift towards offshore wind farms, but it is visible to a smaller extent in other countries, as 
shown later in Section 5.3.   
Figure 9 shows the year-to-year variation in capacity factors across Europe.  The shaded areas 
605 
summarise the distribution of percentiles across all countries, and the thin lines trace the three 
countries with the greatest installed wind capacity.  The error bars on the historic data series 
show the standard deviation across the four historic data sources.  The capacity-weighted mean 
is consistently around 2% lower than the simple average across countries, pulled down by the 
large amount of unproductive capacity in Germany, and the relatively limited capacity in the most 
610 
productive countries (Ireland, Norway, Portugal).

comparing historic data averaged over four sources (left) with our simulation (right).

While the simulation is not perfect, it appears to capture the bulk trends in Europe’s wind 
resources; for example the spread between countries.  The anti-correlation between countries is 
particularly notable during 2010 – a particularly low wind year for most of Northern Europe, but 
one of the better years for Spain.

 Figure 10 shows that the simulation error (its deviation from historic annual CFs) is comparable to 
the uncertainty in those historic CFs.  Error is taken to be the RMS deviation between the 
simulated CFs and the mean of the historic sources; uncertainty is measured by the standard 
deviation across those sources.  The unweighted average error across all countries was 1.37%, 
only slightly higher than the average uncertainty (1.35%).  The interpretation is that for a typical 
625 
country in Europe, the simulated annual capacity factors are on average 1.37% away from our 
best estimate of the true value; but our uncertainty on that true value is ±1.35%.

Dashed lines show the mean across all countries. 
4.3 Monthly Validation 
We compared MERRA to ENTSO-E data for the 13 countries for which installed capacity data 
could be reliably discerned.  The correlation between simulated and actually monthly capacity 
635 
factors, averaged across all countries was R² = 0.91.  In four countries the correlation was over 
0.95, in a further five it was over 0.90; the worst correlations were 0.75 in Greece and 0.78 in 
Portugal.  Further details, including monthly plots for each country are given in the online 
supplement §2.3. 
640 
Figure 11 shows the correlation for two countries at the extremes of our calibration: Germany and 
Spain.  Three features are of note: the good representation that the calibrated VWF model offers; 
the significant difference between the scale factors required for calibration; and the different 
nature of the two calibrations.  In Germany, the regression yields a negative offset and a steep 
gradient, implying that MERRA over-estimates the variability in power output (and thus 
645 
presumably in wind speeds).  In Spain, the opposite is true, and so MERRA under-estimates this 
variability.

 Figure 11: Monthly validation for two countries (before correction) showing very different bias,

but similar accuracy. 
The seasonal profile of Europe’s wind output is shown in Figure 12.  Based on the ENTSO-E data, 
the EU-wide average capacity factor ranges from 30.3 ± 5.2% in winter down to 17.0 ± 2.4% in 
summer (simple averages), or from 28.6% in winter down to 16.0% in summer (capacity-weighted 
655 
averages).  At the extremes, Britain ranges from 39.2% to 19.1%, and Germany from 26.0% to 
12.3% across the seasons.  The calibrated VWF model (Figure 12 right) replicates these statistics 
to within ±0.7%.   
Warmer Mediterranean countries have lower seasonal variation than colder northern European 
660 
countries. This is seen in Figure 12 comparing Spain and Britain.  The ratio of winter to summer 
CF averages 1.52:1 across Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece; compared with 2.04:1 across 
Britain, Germany, Denmark and Norway.  This could benefit the integration of wind into electricity 
systems, as it provides a better match to the seasonality of demand for electricity in cold and 
temperate climates.

The root mean square error (RMSE) between simulated and actual capacity factors is 3.11%; 
implying that an estimated CF of 50% for a given hour can be treated as accurate to within 46.89–
53.11%.  Germany’s wind farms produce less than 6.1% CF for a quarter of the time and more 
than 24.9% for a quarter of the time, the model is able to replicate this distribution of output to 
within ±0.4% except at the extreme upper tail (the 95th percentile is under-estimated by 0.9%). 
685 
The change in CF from hour to hour is normally distributed with a standard deviation of 1.8%. 
The model under-estimates this slightly, as it does for the 4-hourly power swings.

The performance of the VWF model is excellent across northwest Europe, with correlations to 
hourly CFs of above 0.90.  Performance is best in Germany, possibly because of the large number 
of farms and their wide geographic dispersion, meaning that no one anomaly will have significant 
700 
impact.   
The model’s performance is markedly worse in the Mediterranean countries, which appears to be 
due in part to a poor representation of the distribution of CF.  The simple bias correction process 
we use is unable to capture both the seasonal and hourly variability simultaneously.  Adjusting the 
705 
α parameter in equations 5 and 6 to represent the seasonal trend means that hourly variability is 
under-estimated so CF never falls below 4%.  Adjusting them to match the hourly variability 
means the seasonal variability becomes exaggerated.   
This distribution of percentiles (their histograms) are generally well represented, with the error on 
710 
the value of any given percentile being less than ±1.25 percentage points in five of the eight 
countries.  In Spain, Italy and Denmark the errors were substantially higher, as the VWF model 
under-estimated the low tails and over-estimated the high tails of the distributions (see 
Supplementary Figures S7, S10 and S12).   
715 
Finally, we see that the MERRA systematically under-estimates the rate of change of wind 
speeds, as the width of ΔCF is 0.16% to 1.13% smaller than in reality.  The error is generally 
greater in small countries, which have more dramatically varying wind conditions due to their size 
relative to weather fronts, and thus the largest values of ΔCF.   
25 
  
720 
Figure 14 shows the combined seasonal and diurnal trends in Germany.  Each line shows the 
mean CF for each hour of the day across all days in a given season.  Winter sees high CFs in 
Germany, which are reasonably constant throughout the day.  Summer CFs are less than half 
those of winter, and show a strong day/night cycle due to heating from the sun. 
 
725 
 
Figure 14: Seasonal and diurnal trends in the German wind output,  
comparing actual (solid lines) and simulated (dotted). 
 
The VWF model (shown by the dotted lines) is able to replicate these patterns in Germany, as well 
730 
as Spain, Sweden and Ireland, as shown in the online supplement §2.5.  The impact of solar 
heating in the summer and shoulder seasons appears to be slightly over-estimated in France, 
slightly under-estimated in Britain, and dramatically under-estimated in Denmark and Italy.  In 
Denmark, average summer CFs range from 15% at night to 24% in mid-afternoon, whereas the 
model predicts a range from 16% to just 19%.  The situation in Italy is similar.  Correcting for 
735 
these problems would improve both the RMS error and the error on percentiles, which are 
reasonably poor in Denmark, in contrast to other northern-EU countries.

 5 Results from an EU-Wide Analysis 
740 
After validating the bias-corrected VWF model, we used it to simulate the current European fleet 
of wind farms (pictured in Figure 1) operating with weather data from the last 20 years (1995–
2014).  This is the first international assessment to be made using a rigorously validated model, 
and the underlying raw data (hourly national capacity factors) are available to download from 
www.renewables.ninja.   
745 
5.1 Long-Run Average Capacity Factors 
The current European wind fleet has an estimated long-run average CF of 24.2%.  This varies 
from year to year by ±1.0%, which is less pronounced than for individual countries due to the 
diversity benefit of geographical smoothing.  For comparison, the current British wind fleet 
750 
averages 32.4 ± 2.1%, and Germany’s fleet averages 19.6 ± 1.5%, as shown in Figure 15. 
Figure 15: Estimated capacity factors for the present-day EU fleet of wind farms with the last twenty years of 
weather data, showing (left) the variability between years, and (right) the long-run averages for each country.  
Error bars signify the standard deviation in annual CF over the twenty years, and for the relevant countries 
755 
circles denote the averages for onshore and offshore farms.  
The poor wind year experienced across northern Europe is clearly visible in Figure 15; however 
these low wind speeds were not felt across the whole continent, and 2010 was in fact one of the 
better years for Spain.  This variability is purely due to weather effects, as the simulation of a 
760 
static fleet of farms strips out the influence of technological improvement increasing CF over time 
(as highlighted earlier in Figure 8). 
Figure 15 also shows the average CFs estimated for the current offshore fleet in each country.

 CFs average 35.8%, 35.7% and 33.0% respectively.  In other countries they vary more widely as 
there are so few farms installed to date.  The British result fits well with the current average CF of 
Round 1 and 2 offshore farms (~36%) [55], lending confidence to our method of bias correcting 
for onshore and offshore farms separately. 
 
770 
5.2 Distributions and Correlations 
This smoothing effect is evident in the frequency distribution of CFs shown in Figure 16.  
Individual countries have a wide distribution of CF, whereas the aggregate European distribution 
is much narrower, spending more time in the range of 15–35%. 
 
775 
 
Figure 16: The frequency distribution of capacity factors in five countries and Europe as a whole. 
 
The plot also quantifies the tails of each distribution: on a typical weather year, hourly CFs would 
fall below and rise above these values for 24 hours of the year.  The European average CF can be 
780 
expected to remain between 7 and 63% for 363 days of the year, making spatially-aggregated 
wind power a more reliable source of generation than it can be in any single country.   
 
Germany sits at the geographic centre of Europe and hosts the largest wind capacity, therefore 
the correlation between German and European output is strongest at R² = 0.66.  In contrast, 
785 
countries on the edges of Europe have almost no correlation to the continent-wide output: for 
Greece, Romania and Finland R² lies between 0.01 and 0.06.  The results for all countries are 
presented in the online supplement §3.1. 
 
Adding more wind capacity in these peripheral countries would help to further diversify the 
790 
continent’s profile of output, although this would only translate into a practical benefit for system 
operation if there existed sufficient transmission capacity to move this power between countries.

 5.3 Measuring Technical Improvement 
The productivity of national wind fleets has increased gradually over the last ten years, as seen 
795 
earlier in Figure 8 (dashed line) and Figure 9 (dotted line).  This is partly due to technical 
improvement: the move to taller towers and bigger blades.  In the last 10 years, Europe’s average 
wind turbine has grown 15 metres to 66 metres in height [1], granting access to 7% higher wind 
speeds on average.  Some countries, particularly Denmark and Britain, have seen significant 
gains from moving to better locations, with more capacity moving offshore and to sites further 
800 
from shore. 
The Europe-wide capacity factor is also raised by the shift of capacity away from Germany (the 
least productive nation) to windier countries such as Britain and Ireland.  Germany was a first-
mover, holding a 43% share of Europe’s installed capacity in 2005 but only 29% by 2014.  In this 
805 
time, Britain’s share has grown from 3% to 11%.  Given that British wind farms are 65% more 
productive (from Figure 15), this shift alone has resulted in the European average capacity factor 
rising by 1.3 percentage points.  
Simulating Europe’s wind fleet as it evolved over the last twenty years yields a long-run average 
810 
CF of 22.4%, which matches with the historic statistics given in §3.3.  When simulating instead 
Europe’s current wind fleet as of January 2015, this increases to 24.2% (as in Figure 15), implying 
that when weather conditions are held constant, the modern fleet can operate at 2 percentage 
points higher CF than seen over the last two decades. 
815 
In Figure 17, we estimate how the long-run average capacity factor has changed in six countries 
as their wind fleets have evolved, and may continue to evolve in the future.  Spain and Sweden 
could not be included due to insufficient data on farm construction dates.  In the left half of the 
left hand plot, we isolated the farms which were operating at the start of each year from 2005 to 
2015, and then simulated their long-run average CF over the period 1995-2015.  In the right half, 
820 
we simulate the ‘near-term’ future fleet, which adds to the current fleet those farms built during 
2015, under construction and with legal approval; and ‘long-term’ future fleet, which adds all 
farms in the planning pipeline.  The right hand plot summarises the future capacity factors for all 
of the countries we simulated. 
825 
29 
  
 
Figure 17: The increase in long-run average capacity factors due to improving technology and locations. 
 
Looking at the historic assessment, Britain and Denmark have seen the largest rises in 
productivity due to their growing offshore capacity.  Britain’s current fleet operates with a 32.4% 
CF, but if the country had stopped building new farms at the start of 2005, this would be just 
830 
26.4%.  Over the last ten years, Britain and Denmark’s CF have increased by 19% and 17% (in 
relative terms), France and Italy’s have increased 12 and 13%, while Germany and Ireland’s have 
increased by only 7 and 4%.  
 
Looking forwards, the ‘near-term’ and ‘long-term’ future fleets have dramatically higher CFs than 
835 
seen by today’s fleet.  In most countries future CFs continue following their historic trend, 
implying that the planning pipeline in most countries is a natural evolution from the new capacity 
that was developed over the last decade.  For example, the capacity factor for Britain’s near-term 
farms averages 39.7%, and the long-term farms average 43.4%.  This means Britain’s CF 
continues rising from 32.4% today (with 11.9 GW installed) to 36.1% in the near-term (23.4 GW) 
840 
and 39.4% in the long-term (42.3 GW).  In contrast, Denmark’s CF remains relatively flat, 
increasing from 28.9% to only 31.1% in the long-term while capacity rises from 3.4 GW to 6.3 
GW).  
 
This agrees with the findings of Drew et al. who estimated a one-fifth increase in British capacity 
845 
factors circa 2025 (to 39.7%) by simulating the “Round 3” offshore sites (~26 GW of capacity) 
[19].  They disagree with the findings of Andresen et al. however, who estimate a one-third 
increase in Danish capacity factors circa 2025 (to 37.3%) by simulating ~6.5 GW of capacity, with 
both new and all existing farms replaced by new, tall turbines [21].

 One country dramatically defies the historic trend: the strong shift towards new offshore capacity 
in Germany is expected to raise its CF from 19.5% today (with 31.5 GW) to 22.9% in the near-
term (42.3 GW) and 29.1% in the long-term (81.6 GW).  It of course remains to be seen whether all 
of this offshore capacity will be developed, but the prize of doing so will be a German wind fleet 
855 
that is 50% more productive than today’s. 
6 Conclusions 
The pattern of power output from national fleets of wind farms has risen to vital importance for 
both the research and operation of power systems.  The complexity of the weather makes wind 
860 
output challenging to synthesise accurately, and commercial confidentiality means historic data is 
often limited.  We present a model for simulating the hourly power output from wind farms located 
anywhere in the world and validate it across 23 countries in Europe.   
Both the MERRA and MERRA-2 reanalyses contain a systematic bias in wind speeds with a 
865 
strong spatial gradient across Europe.  A naïve simulation using reanalysis without correction 
would therefore yield significant errors in average wind capacity factors; ranging from a 30% 
under-estimate in Portugal and Romania to a 60% over-estimate in Germany and Denmark.  This 
significant bias appears to be present in previous works which have used reanalysis to assess the 
potential for renewables at continental and global scale, and sadly casts doubt on the results they 
870 
reach. 
We develop a simple linear equation for correcting this bias, which depends on only one input: the 
ratio of historic to simulated capacity factors in that location.  Once this correction is applied, the 
simulated hourly capacity factors are able to replicate historic data with exceptional accuracy. 
875 
For example, the simulated hourly outputs for Germany and other northwest European countries 
have a correlation of above 0.95 to historic data, with accurate replication of seasonal and diurnal 
trends, the overall distribution, and the power swings.   
There is little to distinguish MERRA from MERRA-2 in terms of wind speeds.  MERRA-2 yields 
880 
capacity factors that are around 10% lower across Europe, but the spatial heterogeneity in bias is 
slightly greater than for MERRA.  Compared to MERRA, the hourly capacity factors from MERRA-
2 are slightly better correlated in some countries and worse in others; but the difference in results 
is immaterial at less than ±1%, so we currently see no strong reason to favour MERRA-2. 
885 
We use the Virtual Wind Farm (VWF) model to estimate Europe’s national aggregated wind output 
over the last twenty years using MERRA.  The EU-wide output from the current fleet of turbines is 
found to be more stable than individual countries’ output due to geographic smoothing, and 
31 
 higher than historic levels due to the improvement in turbine siting and technology.  The Europe-
wide capacity factor has increased by a tenth over the last ten years, while in individual countries 
890 
it has risen by up to a fifth due to the move offshore. 
 
We also simulate two snapshots of Europe’s future wind fleet, based on those farms under 
construction, with legal approval and in early-stage planning.  These future fleets continue the 
trend of historic technical improvement and exhibit much higher capacity factors than seen today.  
895 
The strongest increases are seen in Britain and Germany due to large developments in the North 
Sea. Capacity factors could reach as high as 40.9% and 32.8% in these two countries, if all of the 
currently planned farms end up being developed. 
 
Such an increase in the productivity of wind farms would have far-reaching consequences: 
900 
increasing the economic viability of wind power, reducing or eliminating the need for subsidies, 
decreasing the energy sales from conventional generators and thus their revenues, and increasing 
the contribution that wind makes towards carbon mitigation. 
 
6.1 Why Is Bias Correction Required? 
905 
Reanalysis is no substitute for detailed micro-scale wind resource modelling.  It is spatially coarse 
and cannot represent the detailed orography in mountainous regions.  So, it is perhaps not 
surprising that some form of correction is required. 
 
The impact of orography on wind speeds in the mountainous regions of Spain, Italy, Greece and 
910 
Scandinavia can exceed ±50%, whereas in the flatter plains of France, northern Germany, Poland 
and England it is ±5% [56].  Reanalyses such as MERRA cannot represent these speed-up effects 
as each grid cell is treated as a flat plane.  If we assume that farm developers are rational and 
install turbines in the windiest locations, we should expect reanalyses to under-estimate wind 
speeds in southern Europe and Scandinavia relative to northern Europe – which is the broad trend 
915 
observed in Figure 7. 
 
The spatial coarseness of reanalyses relative to micro-scale models may also be a factor.  When 
the atmosphere is discretised into 50 x 50 km cells it is not possible to accurately represent the 
underlying atmospheric processes which generate wind speeds.  For example, if a reanalysis 
920 
incorrectly simulates the general trend in storm tracks or over-estimates the strength of the 
westerly winds moving in from the Atlantic over the British Isles and into northwest Europe, it 
would assume higher than observed wind speeds in these areas.  It may be found that other 
reanalyses listed in Table 1 exhibit lower – or different – bias, and so the use of ensemble 
datasets could prove beneficial.  However, as we note in section 2.1, previous studies which use 
925 
ERA-Interim appear to display a geographical trend in bias. 
32 
 A further consideration is that reanalysis models are calibrated to satellite observations of air 
pressure and ground based measurements of wind speed.  ERA-Interim features variational bias 
corrections for irradiance, but not for pressure (from which wind speeds are derived) [57].  The 
930 
ground based measurements come from airports, military bases and other sites of weather 
stations, which are not representative of wind farms.  If wind farm operators could agree to share 
their SCADA data with NASA, ECMWF and other agencies then these observations, which are not 
dissimilar to tall-tower wind speeds, could be added to the assimilation model, giving a better 
representation of the metrics that the energy community are interested in. 
935 
6.2 Future Developments 
A fundamental limitation of reanalysis is the need to calibrate to ensure that capacity factors 
match the level and distribution seen in historic data.  This correction scheme we propose could 
be extended by using bespoke parameters for each individual farm, or by varying parameters by 
940 
season, hour of day, and so forth.  This would improve the model’s ability to replicate historic 
statistics, but would run the risk of over-fitting, and reduce the ease with which the model can be 
transferred to other regions of the world. 
Ultimately, this method is limited by the availability of historic data.  Future effort should be 
945 
directed at developing physics-based methods for bias correction.  If a suitable correction 
scheme could be found, this could ultimately be incorporated into the host reanalysis, improving 
the accuracy of wind speed estimation at source.   
6.3 Open Access 
950 
In an effort to support future research in this area, we make the core dataset from this paper 
available online.  This comprises twenty-year time series of the estimated hourly output from 
Europe’s wind farms aggregated at national level – some 175,320 x 23 observations.  This is 
available for the current, near-term and long-term future fleets that we simulate; allowing the 
evolution of Europe’s wind fleet to be represented in other energy systems models. 
955 
A version of the Virtual Wind Farm model has also been made open-access and is available to use 
via a web interface at www.renewables.ninja, which is described further in [58].  We hope that 
making this data and model available to the community will help to overcome barriers to research 
in this area, avoid duplicated efforts and enable new questions to be answered.
