ABSTRACT
Background and objective:
With the worldwide emer-
gence of highly drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB), novel
agents that have direct antimycobacterial effects or that
enhance host immunity are urgently needed. Curcumin
is a polyphenol responsible for the bright yellow-orange
colour of turmeric, a spice derived from the root of the
perennial herb Curcuma longa. Curcumin is a potent
inducer of apoptosis—an effector mechanism used by
macrophages to kill intracellular Mycobacterium tuber-
culosis (MTB).
Methods:
An in vitro human macrophage infection
model was used to determine the effects of curcumin
on MTB survival.
Results:
We found that curcumin enhanced the clear-
ance of MTB in differentiated THP-1 human monocytes
and in primary human alveolar macrophages. We also
found that curcumin was an inducer of caspase-3-
dependent apoptosis and autophagy. Curcumin medi-
ated these anti-MTB cellular functions, in part, via
inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) activation.
Conclusion:
Curcumin protects against MTB infection
in human macrophages. The host-protective role of
curcumin against MTB in macrophages needs confirma-
tion in an animal model; if validated, the immunomod-
ulatory anti-TB effects of curcumin would be less prone
to drug resistance development.

INTRODUCTION
Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the leading causes of death
worldwide by an infectious agent. Causative factors
include suboptimal access to medical care, immuno-
suppression because of malnutrition, co-infection with
the human immunodeficiency virus and burgeoning
drug resistance.1 While these barriers to controlling
TB require different remedies, enhancing the host im-
munomodulatory response against Mycobacterium tu-
berculosis (MTB) is an attractive approach as it would
be less prone to the development of drug resistance
than direct antimycobacterial agents.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a successful intracel-
lular pathogen that has evolved numerous survival
mechanisms, including interfering with intracellular
membrane trafficking and arresting phagosome matu-
ration in infected host cells.2 When such immune eva-
sive strategies are employed, MTB is successfully able
to replicate within macrophages.3 Macrophages in-
fected with MTB may undergo apoptosis, which has
been shown to enhance killing of MTB as well as facili-
tate antigen presentation to T cells through either MHC
class I or CD1 molecules.4–7 Thus, any increase in apo-
ptosis of MTB-infected macrophages is likely to en-
hance host immunity against MTB.
Curcumin is a polyphenol responsible for the yellow-
orange colour of turmeric, a spice ubiquitously used in
all six habitable continents and is obtained from the
root of the perennial herb Curcuma longa. Curcumin
has been used to treat a panoply of ailments, particu-
larly in Ayurveda medicine.8 In recent years, the
SUMMARY AT A GLANCE
The effects of curcumin (a polyphenol of tumeric)
on Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection
using human macrophages were investigated in this
study. Curcumin reduced the intracellular burden
of MTB in infected macrophages through inhibition
of NFκB activation resulting in the induction of
caspase-3-dependent apoptosis and autophagy.

 biological effects of curcumin in various disease pro-
cesses have been studied, particularly its ability to target
numerous
molecules
and
biological
pathways
governing cancer pathogenesis, for example, curcumin
inhibits the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B
(NFκB), a transcriptional activator used by many can-
cer cells for survival and proliferation.8–17 Because we
previously found that inhibiting NFκB activation re-
duces the viability of MTB in human macrophages,18
we determined the effects of curcumin in an in vitro
MTB infection of human macrophages.
METHODS
Materials
The human promonocytic cell line THP-1 (TIB-202) and
MTB H37Rv (27294) were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). RPMI 1640 cell
culture medium was purchased from Cambrex (East
Rutherford, NJ), fetal bovine serum from Atlanta
Biologicals (Norcross, GA), reagents for Middlebrook
7H10 solid agar medium from Difco (Detroit, MI),
and curcumin, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and phorbol
myristate acetate (PMA) from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). The
TransAM NFκB p65 Transcription Factor Assay Kit was
purchased from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA). Polyclonal
antibody directed against
microtubule-associated
protein light chain 3 (LC3) and β-actin antibody were
purchased from Cell Signalling Technology (Danvers,
MA). Cy3-goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) was purchased
from Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA). A caspase-3 in-
hibitor (z-DEVD-fmk) and an enzyme-linked immuno-
sorbent assay (ELISA) kit for detecting active caspase-3
(Human Active Caspase-3 Immunoassay) were pur-
chased from R & D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN).
Western blots
Expression of the autophagosome-associated LC3-II
and its precursor LC3-I as well as of cytochrome c and
Bax were detected by western blotting using methods
previously described.19 In brief, after SDS-PAGE of
nuclear-free whole cell lysates (20μg protein per condi-
tion), the proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellu-
lose membrane (ISC BioExpress, Kaysville, UT),
blocked in 10% (w/v) non-fat dry milk at 4 °C overnight
with shaking and immunoblotted with a buffer solution
containing 1:1000 anti-LC3B antibody in 5% BSA (w/v),
1:1000 anti-cytochrome c antibody in 5% (w/v) non-fat
dry milk or 1:1000 anti-Bax antibody in 5% BSA (w/v)
for 1h at room temperature shaking. After incubation
with
horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated
secondary
anti-rabbit antibody (1:2000) in 5% (w/v) non-fat dry
milk for 1 h at room temperature, bound antibodies
were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence.
Autophagosome detection
To quantify LC3-II-positive punctae in MTB-infected
THP-1 cells, immunocytochemistry was performed as
previously described (3). In brief, on chamber slides of
differentiated THP-1 cells, the cells were treated
with 30μM curcumin and incubated for 1h prior to
infection with GFP-MTB at a multiplicity-of-infection
(MOI) of 10 bacilli to one macrophage. After 24h, the
cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed
and blocked with a blocking buffer, and incubated
with a polyclonal rabbit LC3-II antibody (1:100) over-
night at 4°C. The cells were then washed thrice with
1X PBS and 1:1000 Cy3-labelled goat anti-rabbit IgG
secondary antibody added for 30min at room temper-
ature while shielded from light. After rinsing with 1X
PBS, the cells were stained with ProLong Gold Antifade
reagent with DAPI and placed in the dark at 4 °C
until analysis by fluorescent microscopy. The number
of autophagosomes was quantified as previously
described.18
NFκB p65 activation assay
Activation of the p65 subunit of NFκB was quantified
using the TransAM NFκB p65 Transcription Factor
Assay Kit per manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, for
each condition, 10μg nuclear protein extracts of treated
cells were incubated in 96-well plates coated with an ol-
igonucleotide containing the NFκB consensus binding
site (5’ GGGACTTTCC-3’ oligonucleotide) or a mutated
oligonucleotide for 1 h at room temperature. After
washing three times, NFκB p65 antibody was added
for 1 h followed by HRP-conjugated secondary anti-
body. Binding of activated p65 NFκB was determined
colorimetrically.
Differentiation of THP-1 cells, isolation of alveolar
macrophages, infection of macrophages with MTB,
TUNEL assay and statistical analysis were as described
in previous studies.18,19
RESULTS
Curcumin reduces the burden of intracellular
Mycobacterium tuberculosis in human THP-1 cells
To examine the effects of curcumin in MTB-infected
human macrophages, differentiated THP-1 human
monocytes were pre-incubated with 10, 30, and 50μM
curcumin or 0.05% DMSO (vehicle amount in 50μM
of curcumin) for 1h and then infected with MTB
H37Rv. These curcumin concentrations were chosen
because they were previously shown to induce apopto-
sis in human macrophages.20 One hour after infection
(Day 0), the number of intracellular MTB was similar
among the various conditions (Fig. 1a), indicating that
curcumin did not affect phagocytosis. For control cells
that were incubated with 0.05% DMSO, there was a sig-
nificant increase in the number of intracellular MTB
from 1h (Day 0) to 4days after infection. In the presence
of
10μM
curcumin,
there
was
a
trend
towards
inhibition of MTB growth by 4days. With 30 or 50μM
curcumin, there was a significant decrease in the num-
ber of MTB recovered at 2 and 4days after infection
compared with control cells.
Based on these findings, we next examined the
effects of curcumin in MTB-infected primary human
alveolar macrophages. As seen with the THP-1 cells,
50μM of curcumin significantly reduced the number
of viable intracellular MTB recovered after 4 days of
infection (Fig. 1b). In separate experiments, curcumin

 at concentrations up to 50 μM had no significant direct
effect on MTB growth in the absence of macrophages
(data not shown).
Curcumin induces apoptosis of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis-infected THP-1 cells
We next determined whether curcumin induces apo-
ptosis of MTB-infected THP-1 cells. By TUNEL staining,
there was a dose-dependent increase in apoptosis in
uninfected cells incubated with curcumin (Fig. 2a, open
bars). MTB infection of THP-1 cells also induced a mod-
est increase in apoptosis, but in the presence of increas-
ing concentrations of curcumin, there was a significant
and progressive increase in the percentage of TUNEL-
positive cells (Fig. 2a, closed bars).
Because activated caspase-3 is the effector cas-
pase for both mitochondria-dependent (intrinsic) and
mitochondria-independent (extrinsic) apoptotic path-
ways, we corroborated the apoptotic findings by
quantifying caspase-3 activation in the presence of
curcumin. THP-1 cells were incubated with varying
concentrations of curcumin alone or with MTB infec-
tion, cultured overnight, lysed and activated caspase-
3 measured by ELISA. As shown in Figure 2b, there
was a modest, dose-dependent increase in activated
caspase-3 in uninfected cells treated with curcumin.
However, in cells infected with MTB, there was a signif-
icant increase in activated caspase-3 with increasing
concentrations of curcumin. To further validate the
induction of apoptosis of MTB-infected THP-1 cells by
curcumin, the expression of cytochrome C and Bax
were determined by immunoblotting. As shown in
Figure 1
Curcumin inhibits the
growth of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (MTB) in human
macrophages. (a) THP-1 cells and
(b) primary human alveolar
macrophages were pretreated with
curcumin at the indicated

followed by infection with MTB.
One hour, 2 and 4 days after
infection, the cells were lysed and
cultured for MTB. Data shown as

immunoblots of three independent experiments are shown.

 Figure 2c, curcumin induced expression of these pro-
apoptotic molecules in a dose-dependent manner.
Inhibition of caspase-3 abrogates effects of
curcumin
We next investigated the importance of caspase-3-
dependent
classical
apoptosis
in
mediating
the
anti-MTB effects of curcumin. THP-1 cells were either
left unstimulated, infected with MTB alone or incu-
bated with both curcumin and MTB with or without
a caspase-3 inhibitor (Z-DEVD-fmk), and cultured
for 24 h (for TUNEL assay) or 2 days (for Colony
forming units (CFU) determination). As previously
seen, curcumin significantly increased the number
of apoptotic cells (Fig. 3a) and reduced the number
of recovered CFU (Fig. 3b); however, pharmacologic
inhibition of caspase-3 significantly abrogated both
of these effects (Fig. 3a/b). There were no significant
differences between 10 and 20 μM of z-DEVD-fmk in
regard to either apoptosis or CFU (data not shown).
Curcumin induces autophagy in Mycobacterium
tuberculosis-infected THP-1 cells
Autophagy is another effector mechanism used by host
cells to help eliminate intracellular MTB.21,22 Thus, we
determined whether curcumin induces autophagy.
We first qualitatively determined the presence of
autophagy by detecting for the presence of LC3-II, a
protein critical in the formation of the autophagic
membrane and considered to be a specific marker for
autophagosome formation.23 THP-1 cells were pre-
incubated with 30μM curcumin or 0.03% DMSO for
1h and then infected with MTB for 6, 18, or 24h. After
the indicated times, whole cell lysates were prepared,
and
the
proteins
separated
by
SDS-PAGE
were
immunoblotted with an antibody that detects both
LC3-I and LC3-II isoforms. We found weak expression
of LC3-I and LC3-II in untreated cells (Fig. 4a, bar 1).
There was also little induction of the LC3-I or LC3-II
protein following incubation with only curcumin for
18 h (Fig. 4a, bar 2). MTB infection alone for 18h
resulted in a significant increase in LC3-II expression,
but in the presence of both MTB and curcumin for
6 to 24h, there were further increases in LC3-II
expression.
The number of LC3-II-positive autophagosomes in
MTB-infected cells was also quantified by fluorescent
microscopy. As shown in Fig. 4b/c, curcumin in-
creased
the
number
of
LC3-II-positive
punctae
(autophagosomes) per cell by a mean of ~2.5-fold.
Curcumin inhibits Mycobacterium tuberculosis-
induced NFκB activation
Because MTB activates NFκB,24–26 and we previously
showed that NFκB activation inhibits both apoptosis
and autophagy in MTB-infected human macrophages,
impairing their control of the infection,18 we deter-
mined whether curcumin inhibits MTB-induced NFκB
activation. THP-1 cells were infected with MTB for
30min and 3h and p65 NFκB binding to its consensus
oligonucleotide quantified. As shown in Figure 5a,
MTB induced NFκB p65 binding at both time points,
and curcumin significantly inhibited this activation.
DISCUSSION
Drug-susceptible TB is almost always curable if an ef-
fective drug regimen is adhered to; in contrast, infec-
tion with MTB strains exhibiting high levels of drug
resistance (e.g. multidrug resistant TB and extensively
resistant TB) is associated with significantly lower cure
rates and increased mortality.27–29 While favourable re-
sults have been reported with new anti-TB drugs such
as bedaquiline and delamanid, it is important to em-
phasize that efficacy was initially based on the surro-
gate endpoint of accelerated culture conversion and
not on cure rate or survival30–34; indeed, in the phase
2 trial, there were significantly more deaths when
bedaquiline was added to the standard regimen.30 Fur-
thermore, history teaches us that with introduction of
new drugs, as they become more widely used and
hence misused; resistance tends to be a matter of
Figure 3
Curcumin induction of apoptosis and inhibition of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) growth in macrophages is partly caspase-3
dependent. (a) THP-1 cells were incubated with 30 μM curcumin, MTB, or both with and without 10 μM caspase-3 inhibitor (z-DEVD-fmk) for
24 h, followed by TUNEL assay. Data shown are mean ± SEM of three independent experiments. (b) THP-1 cells were incubated with medium
alone, 30 μM curcumin or 30 μM curcumin plus 10 μM z-DEVD-fmk, and then infected with MTB. MTB was enumerated four days following
infection. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.

 ‘when’ rather than ‘if’. Thus, continuing to search for
agents that enhance host immunity to kill MTB and
are free of serious side effects should be a priority; this
approach would, theoretically, be more impervious to
development of drug resistance by the bacilli com-
pared with direct antimicrobials.
We previously showed that pharmacologic inhibi-
tion of NFκB activation resulted in improved macro-
phage control of MTB infection.18 Thus, we reasoned
that curcumin may have a similar effect because
curcumin is a potent inhibitor of NFκB activation. We
found that curcumin reduced the intracellular burden
of MTB-infected macrophages through induction of
apoptosis and autophagy (Fig. 5b). Pharmacologic
inhibition of caspase-3 significantly abrogated the
apoptosis and the anti-MTB effect of curcumin, indi-
cating that the salutary effects of curcumin in macro-
phages are at least partially through induction of
caspase-3-dependent apoptosis. Combined with the
aforementioned report that NFκB inhibition enhanced
macrophage effector function against MTB,18 the
mechanism by which curcumin induces autophagy is
likely mediated through inhibition of NFκB (Fig. 5b).
Li and colleagues reported that although the 19kDa
lipoprotein of MTB and curcumin individually induced
apoptosis in human monocyte-derived macrophages,
curcumin paradoxically inhibited the apoptosis induced
by 19kDa lipoprotein.35 They further demonstrated that
inhibition by curcumin of lipoprotein-induced c-Jun
kinase (JNK) activation was the mechanism by which
curcumin antagonized the pro-apoptotic and pro-
inflammatory effects of the MTB lipoprotein. In con-
trast, we did not find that curcumin antagonized
MTB-induced apoptosis and in fact observed at least
an additive effect of curcumin and MTB in inducing
apoptosis. While the reason for these differences are
not known, it is likely that a greater number of differ-
ent signalling pathways are induced by whole MTB
as compared with a single MTB component (i.e.
19 kDa lipoprotein), and thus, any inhibition of the
JNK pathway by curcumin is less likely to have as great
an impact upon stimulation of macrophages with
whole MTB.
Other groups have investigated the effects of
curcumin on MTB infection, and our current mecha-
nistic studies build upon that knowledge. Gupta and

 co-workers found that curcumin reduced the intracel-
lular burden of MTB H37Rv and two clinical strains of
drug-resistant MTB in RAW 264.7 murine macrophages
in a dose-dependent fashion.36 Because curcumin
alone—without macrophages—did not have any signif-
icant antimicrobial effect on MTB, the authors hypoth-
esized that curcumin augmented macrophage killing
of MTB.36 We also found that curcumin at≤ 50μM had
no direct microbicidal effect on MTB (data not shown).
In contrast, Changtam et al. showed that curcumin had
direct microbicidal activity against MTB H37Ra but
required very high levels—on the order of >250μM
curcumin37—which are physiologically unattainable at
the present time. Interestingly, Baldwin et al. found that
the monocarbonyl analogues of curcumin inhibit
growth of MTB at concentrations ≤50μM.38 While these
findings are contrary to what we observed, they are not
contradictory because these curcumin analogues are
structurally distinct from native curcumin. Although
we found that curcumin-induced macrophage apopto-
sis and autophagy are mechanisms by which curcumin
exerts its anti-MTB effect, curcumin has also been
shown to induce production of cathelicidin, an endoge-
nous
antimicrobial
peptide
capable
of
killing
of
MTB.39,40
While the anti-MTB effect of curcumin in macro-
phages is promising, in vivo animal studies will be
needed to validate whether curcumin can potentially
be used as an adjuvant therapeutic or whether it may
be harmful because mice with genetic disruption for
p50 NFκB are more susceptible to MTB.41 We also
found that curcumin modestly induced apoptosis
in uninfected cells and thus further rationale that
in vivo studies are needed to validate or refute our find-
ings of the anti-TB effects of curcumin. One important
issue that must be addressed before pursuing in vivo
studies is the notoriously poor bioavailability of
curcumin when administered orally, because of its very
poor systemic absorption from the gastrointestinal
tract as well as its rapid metabolism and elimination.42
These barriers to oral administration have led to the
development of curcumin delivered subcutaneously
or intraperitoneally, but both administration routes
are clinically unattractive. Thus, in an attempt to in-
crease curcumin absorption from the gastrointestinal
tract and to decrease its elimination—which has obvi-
ous pragmatic advantages—curcumin has been formu-
lated as nanoparticles, liposomal encapsulation and
emulsions as well as complexed with cyclodextrin and
several of these formulations look promising.43,44 The
monocarbonyl analogues of curcumin are particularly
promising because they not only have greater direct an-
timicrobial activity but also better bioavailability.38
In summary, we have shown that curcumin can
augment the ability of human macrophages to control
MTB infection. While the results are promising,
in vivo studies using a practical approach to achieve
therapeutic tissue levels of curcumin are needed to ad-
vance our findings to one that is more clinically rele-
vant.
Moreover,
future
studies
utilizing
newer
analogues of curcumin may yield greater anti-MTB ef-
fects and examining curcumin-induced gene expres-
sion
in
macrophages/murine
model
may
reveal
previously
unexplored
mechanisms
of
action
of
curcumin. The potential for curcumin—well studied
in oncology—having a salubrious effect against infec-
tions is realistic as it has been observed that immuno-
modulatory approaches against cancer and infections
have several mechanistic similarities.45
