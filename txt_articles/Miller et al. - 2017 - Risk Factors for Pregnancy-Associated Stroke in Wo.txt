P
reeclampsia is a multisystem hypertensive disorder unique 
to pregnancy, characterized by widespread endothelial 
dysfunction and immune dysregulation.1 Approximately 36% 
of women with pregnancy-associated strokes (PASs) have 
comorbid preeclampsia,2 and preeclampsia increases stroke 
risk during the puerperium up to 6-fold.3 Among women with 
PAS, women with preeclampsia are at increased risk of com-
plications and death.4,5
Although preeclampsia affects 3% to 8% of all pregnan-
cies,3,6 the overall occurrence of PAS remains rare (34.2 per 
100 000 deliveries).7 Older age, black race, and lack of pri-
vate insurance are associated with PAS in women with pre-
eclampsia,4,8 and increased preeclampsia severity is associated 
with an increased risk of cardiovascular events.9 The rarity of 
PAS makes it difficult to predict which preeclampsia patients 
are at highest risk for cerebrovascular complications. The 
American Heart Association/American Stroke Association 
found insufficient evidence to make recommendations on pre-
vention of stroke in pregnancy complicated by hypertensive 
disorders.10 
We sought to identify modifiable risk factors that put 
women with preeclampsia at highest risk of PAS.
Methods
Study Design and Data Description
We performed a case–control study using billing data, coded according 
to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, from 
the 2003 to 2012 New York State Department of Health Statewide 
Planning and Research Cooperative System inpatient database. We 
identified all women aged 12 to 55 years old admitted with pre-
eclampsia, including mild preeclampsia (642.4x [where x is any fifth 
digit from 0–9], 642.7x), severe preeclampsia (642.5x), or eclampsia 
(642.6x) from January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2012. Women 
without preeclampsia were not included in the study, regardless 
of whether they had strokes during or after pregnancy. Cases were 
Background and Purpose—Preeclampsia affects 3% to 8% of pregnancies and increases risk of pregnancy-associated 
stroke (PAS). Data are limited on which women with preeclampsia are at highest risk for PAS.
Methods—Using billing data from the 2003 to 2012 New York State Department of Health inpatient database, we matched 
women with preeclampsia and PAS 1:3 to preeclamptic controls based on age and race/ethnicity. Pre-defined PAS risk 
factors included pregnancy complications, infection present on admission, vascular risk factors, prothrombotic states, and 
coagulopathies. We constructed multivariable conditional logistic regression models to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) 
and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for independent risk factors for PAS.
Results—Among women aged 12 to 55 years admitted to New York State hospitals for any reason during the study period 
(n=3 373 114), 88 857 had preeclampsia, and 197 of whom (0.2%) had PAS. In multivariable analysis, women with 
preeclampsia and stroke were more likely than controls to have severe preeclampsia or eclampsia (OR, 7.2; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 4.6–11.3), infections present on admission (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.6–5.8), prothrombotic states 
(OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.3–9.2), coagulopathies (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.3–7.1), or chronic hypertension (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 
1.8–5.5). Additional analyses matched and stratified by severity of preeclampsia confirmed these results.
Conclusions—Infections, chronic hypertension, coagulopathies, and underlying prothrombotic conditions increase PAS 
risk in women with preeclampsia. These women may warrant closer monitoring.

defined as women with preeclampsia and PAS, including diagnosis 
codes for transient ischemic attack or ischemic stroke, intracere-
bral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), cerebral venous 
thrombosis, and codes specific for nonspecified PAS. Pregnancy-
specific stroke codes were validated using internal data sets (Table I 
in the online-only Data Supplement). In women with >1 stroke admis-
sion, we counted only the first admission. We characterized PAS in 
terms of timing and stroke subtype. Although stroke risk is increased 
up to 12 weeks after delivery,11 a 6-week post-partum time frame 
was chosen because of limitations of International Classification of 
Diseases, Ninth Revision, coding.12 Traumatic intracerebral hemor-
rhage and SAH and hospitalizations with a primary rehabilitation 
diagnosis (V57.89) were excluded. We matched each stroke case to 3 
controls of the same age, race/ethnicity, and insurance status, selected 
randomly from the pool of women with preeclampsia without PAS.
Pre-defined exposures of interest, selected based on previ-
ously described associations with preeclampsia and PAS, included 
pregnancy-related variables, chronic vascular risk factors, comor-
bid prothrombotic states, coagulopathies/bleeding disorders, and 
infection of any type present on admission (POA), identified with a 
Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System–specific indi-
cator.13,14 Infections acquired during the stroke hospitalization were 
not included. Coding details are in Table II in the online-only Data 
Supplement.
Cerebral symptoms are sufficient to classify preeclampsia as 
severe.15,16 Because all our cases likely had neurological symptoms, 
this could create selection bias, confusing the relationship between 
severity of preeclampsia and stroke risk (ie, women with stroke and 
preeclampsia might by definition be coded as having severe pre-
eclampsia). We therefore conducted a separate analysis matching 
each case to 3 controls of the same age, race/ethnicity, and severity 
of preeclampsia. Pre-specified subgroup analyses stratified the sever-
ity-matched cohort into 2 groups: those with mild preeclampsia and 
those with severe preeclampsia or eclampsia.
Statistical Analysis
We conducted univariable analyses comparing risk factors among 
cases and controls using χ2 tests. Including only those PAS risk factors 
with P<0.2 from the univariable analysis,17 we calculated unadjusted 
and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% 
CI) using multivariable conditional logistic regression. Pre-specified 
subgroup analyses included a sensitivity analysis excluding all cases 
and controls with eclampsia (642.6x) and a subgroup analysis of post-
partum strokes. All analyses were completed with SAS version 9.3 
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC). A P<0.05 was set as the significance level.
Study Approvals
Approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of 
Columbia University Medical Center to conduct the analyses. 
Requirement for consent was waived because of the public, deidenti-
fied nature of the data.
Results
Baseline Characteristics of Women With 
Preeclampsia With and Without PAS
Among women aged 12 to 55 years admitted for any reason 
during the study period (n=3 373 114), 88 857 had preeclamp-
sia, including eclampsia. Of these, 197 (0.2%) had PAS and 
were identified as cases, giving a cumulative incidence of PAS 
in women with preeclampsia of 222/100 000 during the study 
period. In the unmatched sample, compared with the 88 660 
women with preeclampsia who did not have PAS, women 
with preeclampsia and PAS were older, had higher propor-
tion of black race, lower proportion of Hispanic ethnicity, 
and higher proportion of severe preeclampsia (42.1% versus 
29%) or eclampsia (28.9% versus 2%; Figure 1). Among 
cases, median age was 32 years (interquartile range, 26–36); 
57 women (28.9%) had mild preeclampsia, 83 (42.1%) had 
severe preeclampsia, and 57 (28.9%) had eclampsia. The 197 
stroke cases were matched with 591 nonstroke controls of the 
same age, race/ethnicity, and insurance status (Figure 2).
Timing and Characteristics of Strokes in 
Women With Preeclampsia and PAS
Among the 197 women with strokes, 55 (27.9%) strokes 
occurred antepartum; 8 (4.1%) occurred during the delivery 
hospitalization without further characterization in timing; 
131 (66.5%) occurred post-partum; and 3 (1.5%) occurred 
during an admission without delivery, with no further char-
acterization of timing. Of 131 post-partum strokes, 82 
(62.6%) occurred after discharge (Figure 2). Stroke types 
included 92 (46.7%) hemorrhagic strokes, 26 (13.1%) isch-
emic, 8 (4.1%) transient ischemic attack, 5 (2.5%) cerebral 
venous thromboses, and 70 (35.5%) nonspecific PAS; 9 
women had multiple subtypes (Figure I in the online-only 
Data Supplement). In-hospital mortality was 13.2% among 
cases, compared with 0.2% among controls. Details of dis-
charge disposition/mortality are in Table III in the online-
only Data Supplement.
Stroke Risk Factors in Cases and Controls 
Matched on Age/Race-Ethnicity/Insurance
In univariable analysis, women with PAS had a higher pro-
portion than controls of severe preeclampsia or eclampsia, 
infections POA, chronic hypertension, prothrombotic states, 
coagulopathies, migraine, and heart disease (Table 1). The dif-
ference in infections between cases and controls was driven by 
genitourinary infections: 71% of infections in cases were gen-
itourinary, compared with 39% of infections in controls, and 
genitourinary infections occurred in 10% of cases compared 
with 2% of controls (P<0.0001). After adjusting for other risk 
factors, significant risk factors for stroke were severe pre-
eclampsia or eclampsia (OR, 7.2; 95% CI, 4.6–11.3), infec-
tions POA (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.6–5.8), chronic hypertension 
(OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.8–5.5), prothrombotic states (OR, 3.5; 
95% CI, 1.3–9.2), and coagulopathies (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.3–
7.1; Table 2).
Demographics and Risk Factors in 
Severity-Matched Cohort
When cases were matched to controls by preeclampsia sever-
ity, similar risk factors emerged: infections POA (OR, 2.6; 
95% CI, 1.4–4.6), prothrombotic states (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 
1.3–6.4), and chronic hypertension (OR, 4.2; 95% CI, 2.4–7.4) 
conferred greater risk of stroke after adjusting for other risk 
factors (Table 3). In the severity-stratified subgroup analysis, 
after adjusting for other variables, chronic hypertension (OR, 
3.0; 95% CI, 1.4–6.3) and infection POA (OR, 4.5; 95% CI, 
1.6–12.6) were significant stroke risk factors in the mild sub-
group (n=57). In the severe subgroup (n=140), chronic hyper-
tension (OR, 8.4; 95% CI, 3.1–22.5) and prothrombotic states 
(OR, 6.6; 95% CI, 2.5–17.5) increased stroke risk; the asso-
ciation of infection POA did not reach statistical significance

after adjusting for other risk factors (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 0.9–4.0; 
Table IV in the online-only Data Supplement). Demographics 
of mild versus severe cases and controls are shown in Table V 
in the online-only Data Supplement.
Subgroup Analyses
In the subgroup analysis excluding women with eclampsia 
(International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, 
642.6x), results were similar: women with chronic hyper-
tension (adjusted OR, 4.2; 95% CI, 2.2–7.8), infection POA 
(adjusted OR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.8–7.7), and prothrombotic 
states (adjusted OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.1–6.3) had higher risk of 
stroke (Table VI in the online-only Data Supplement). In the 
subgroup analysis, including only post-partum stroke, fewer 
cases than controls delivered via cesarean section (52% ver-
sus 65%; P=0.01). However, after adjusting for other risk fac-
tors, there was no significant association between cesarean

197 individual women had PEC and stroke. Strokes were 
classified as post-partum if they occurred either during a 
post-partum admission or during a delivery admission that 
included a pregnancy-specific stroke code with a fifth digit of 
2 or 4 indicating a post-partum complication, in accordance 
with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, 
coding guidelines.12 If the pregnancy-specific stroke code had 
a fifth digit of 3 indicating an antepartum complication, and 
the admission included a delivery, the stroke was categorized 
as antepartum.

Otherwise, similar risk factors were found in women with 
post-partum stroke (Tables VII and VIII in the online-only 
Data Supplement).
Discussion
In this case–control study in a diverse population of women 
with preeclampsia, we found that risk factors for PAS 
included infections (predominantly genitourinary), chronic 
hypertension, prothrombotic conditions, and coagulopa-
thies. The cumulative incidence of stroke in our preeclamptic

population was 222/100 000, >6 times the incidence of stroke 
in the overall pregnant population, consistent with prior stud-
ies.3,4 Two thirds of cases of PAS (131 of 197) were diag-
nosed post-partum, consistent with prior research.7 More 
than 1 in 10 women with preeclampsia and PAS died dur-
ing their admission for stroke, likely reflecting the large 
proportion of hemorrhagic strokes.18 In comparison, overall 
US maternal mortality in 2011 was 17.8 per 100 000 deliver-
ies, or 0.02%,5,19–21 emphasizing the importance of identify-
ing women at the highest risk of PAS and targeting them for 
closer monitoring.
Infection
Infection is increasingly recognized as a trigger for stroke, par-
ticularly in young people.14,22 Proposed mechanisms include 
increased levels of inflammatory cytokines leading to plate-
let aggregation and impaired endothelial function. Infections 
may also provoke cardiac arrhythmias or dehydration-induced 
thrombosis; in 1 study, infections tripled the odds of peri-
partum cerebral venous thrombosis.23 The pathophysiology 
of preeclampsia remains incompletely understood1 although 
imbalance of pro- and antiangiogenic factors and an increase 
in proinflammatory cytokines seem to play roles.24 Animal 
models of preeclampsia have demonstrated impaired cerebral 
autoregulation, increased blood-brain barrier permeability, 
and neuronal hyperexcitability, mediated by elevated levels 
of tumor necrosis factor-α.25–28 In the setting of preeclampsia-
associated inflammation and puerperial hypercoagulability, 
superimposed infection could trigger stroke by exacerbating 
inflammation and coagulopathy.11
Although we included only infections POA in our analy-
sis, it is important to acknowledge that we cannot be certain 
that the infection preceded the stroke without a prospec-
tive study. Nevertheless, a possible association between 
infection and preeclampsia-associated stroke has important 
clinical implications because it may represent a modifiable 
risk factor. The difference in infections between cases and 
controls in our cohort was driven entirely by genitourinary 
infections. Symptoms of urinary infections, such as dys-
uria or incontinence, may go unrecognized in post-partum 
women because similar symptoms may occur with normal 
post-partum recovery. Women with preeclampsia undergo 
post-partum blood pressure checks; screening for urinary 
tract infections at these visits and monitoring those with 
infections more closely for neurological symptoms may be 
warranted. The role for prophylactic antibiotics could be 
considered on a case by case basis and may be a target in 
clinical trials.
Chronic Hypertension
The role of chronic hypertension in preeclampsia-associated 
stroke is poorly characterized. Chronic hypertension shifts 
the cerebral autoregulatory curve29 but is not associated with 
loss of dynamic cerebral autoregulatory capacity because 
of rapid adaptation of the cerebral vasculature.30 However, 
acute malignant hypertension in chronically hypertensive 
patients severely impairs dynamic cerebral autoregulation.31 
Preeclampsia may cause impairment of cerebrovascular 
autoreactivity,32 leading to hyperemia, hypertensive leuko-
encephalopathy, and the reversible cerebral vasocontriction 
syndrome,33 all of which can be associated with stroke.34 
Reversible cerebral vasocontriction syndrome is highly 
associated with post-partum stroke.35 Unfortunately, we 
were unable to assess investigate the role of reversible cere-
bral vasocontriction syndrome and stroke in our population 
because reversible cerebral vasocontriction syndrome is not 
reliably captured by International Classification of Diseases, 
Ninth Revision, coding.
Prothrombotic Conditions and Coagulopathies
Women with an underlying propensity to thrombosis are 
at increased risk of stroke when pregnancy, itself a hyper-
coagulable state, is complicated by preeclampsia.4,36 Only 
2.5% of strokes in our cohort were because of cerebral 
venous thrombosis, suggesting that prothrombotic states 
may put women at risk of arterial thrombosis and hem-
orrhagic stroke as well. However, cerebral venous throm-
bosis, which may also present with hemorrhage, may be 
underdiagnosed. Women with underlying thrombophilia 
may have been on antithrombotic treatment during or 
after their pregnancy, increasing their intracerebral hemor-
rhage/SAH risk. Patients with preeclampsia and a history 
of coagulopathy likely warrant increased vigilance in the 
peripartum period.

Other Vascular Risk Factors
Heart disease has been identified as a risk factor for PAS in 
women with preeclampsia.4 After adjusting for other risk fac-
tors, our results failed to show significant between-group dif-
ferences in heart disease. Similarly, we found no significant 
differences in stroke risk comparing other traditional vascular 
risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, chronic renal 
disease, smoking, and other substance abuse. In fact, propor-
tions of these risk factors were low in both cases and controls. 
Our study may have been underpowered to detect between-
group differences in some risk factors because other studies 
have found otherwise; alternatively, the pathophysiology of 
PAS in women with preeclampsia may bear little relationship 
to traditional vascular risk factors.
Preeclampsia Severity
Preeclampsia is regarded as a disease along a continuum; 
women with gestational hypertension may go on to develop 
preeclampsia and then severe preeclampsia.37 Women with 
severe preeclampsia were over-represented in our cases com-
pared with the overall population of women with preeclamp-
sia; however, it is difficult to interpret this finding because 
any cerebral symptom in a woman with preeclampsia is con-
sidered a severe feature, creating a significant selection bias. 
Further complicating interpretation of our data is the updating 
of diagnostic criteria for severe preeclampsia in 2013, after 
our study period.16 The lack of data on the HELLP (hemolysis, 
elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets) syndrome , a vari-
ant of preeclampsia, is a limitation of our study because these 
women may be at particularly high stroke risk.38
Research in Context: Study 
Strengths and Limitations
Two prior population-based studies compared women with 
preeclampsia and stroke to women with preeclampsia with-
out stroke.39,40 Neither study was designed to identify mul-
tiple independent risk factors for stroke in this population: 
one compared only mortality outcomes and the other com-
pared methods of anesthesia during delivery. The ethnic and 
regional diversity of New York State increases the generaliz-
ability of our findings. Matching of cases and controls allowed 
for nuanced analysis of other risk factors. We conducted mul-
tiple subgroup analyses to explore possible biasing factors in 
our results.
Our study has limitations. Data were drawn from a large 
administrative database, and there may be coding errors. 
Some preeclampsia cases may not have been formally diag-
nosed and thus not included in the study. Pregnancy-specific

stroke codes do not distinguish between stroke subtypes, 
limiting the granularity of the data, although the majority of 
patients had additional codes to identify stroke subtypes with 
more precision (Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement). 
Although the proportion of each of the prothrombotic condi-
tions individually (hypercoagulable states, history of throm-
boembolic events, systemic lupus erythematosis, and sickle 
cell disease) was higher in cases than controls, grouping them 
together may overestimate their effects. Diagnosis of pro-
thrombotic conditions or coagulopathies may have occurred 
only after the stroke, leading to ascertainment bias. Although 
we included only infections POA for stroke, exact timing of 
infections in relation to stroke onset cannot be confirmed 
without a prospective study. Causality cannot be inferred 
from this observational study, and results should be inter-
preted cautiously.
In summary, urinary tract infections, chronic hyperten-
sion, prothrombotic conditions, and coagulopathies increased 
stroke risk in women with preeclampsia. Infections may be 
an important treatable risk factor in this population; similarly, 
screening for coagulopathies and prothrombotic conditions 
may be warranted in women with preeclampsia. Prospective 
studies are needed to confirm these findings and develop inter-
ventions aimed at preventing strokes in this uniquely vulner-
able group.
