Abstract
Objectives: This was a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the incidence of adverse events
in adults undergoing procedural sedation in the emergency department (ED).
Methods: Eight electronic databases were searched, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBSCO, CINAHL,
CENTRAL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science, and Scopus, from January 2005
through 2015. Randomized controlled trials and observational studies of adults undergoing procedural
sedation in the ED that reported a priori selected outcomes and adverse events were included. Meta-
analysis was performed using a random-effects model and reported as incidence rates with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs).
Results: The search yielded 2,046 titles for review. Fifty-five articles were eligible, including 9,652
procedural sedations. The most common adverse event was hypoxia, with an incidence of 40.2 per 1,000
sedations (95% CI = 32.5 to 47.9), followed by vomiting with 16.4 per 1,000 sedations (95% CI = 9.7 to
23.0) and hypotension with 15.2 per 1,000 sedations (95% CI = 10.7 to 19.7). Severe adverse events
requiring emergent medical intervention were rare, with one case of aspiration in 2,370 sedations (1.2
per 1,000), one case of laryngospasm in 883 sedations (4.2 per 1,000), and two intubations in 3,636
sedations (1.6 per 1,000). The incidence of agitation and vomiting were higher with ketamine (164.1 per
1,000 and 170.0 per 1,000, respectively). Apnea was more frequent with midazolam (51.4 per 1,000), and
hypoxia was less frequent in patients who received ketamine/propofol compared to other combinations.
The case of laryngospasm was in a patient who received ketamine, and the aspiration and intubations
were in patients who received propofol. When propofol and ketamine are combined, the incidences of
agitation, apnea, hypoxia, bradycardia, hypotension, and vomiting were lower compared to each
medication separately.
Conclusions: Serious adverse events during procedural sedation like laryngospasm, aspiration, and
intubation are exceedingly rare. Quantitative risk estimates are provided to facilitate shared decision-
making, risk communication, and informed consent.

P
rocedural sedation and analgesia (PSA) is rou-
tinely performed in the emergency department
(ED) to facilitate potentially painful procedures by
alleviating pain, anxiety, and suffering.1 PSA involves
the use of short-acting analgesic and sedative medi-
cations
to
enable
clinicians
to
perform
procedures

 effectively and requires monitoring the patient closely
for potential adverse effects.
As emergency physicians (EPs), we are uniquely qual-
ified to provide all levels of sedation. ED-based PSA has
been shown to be safe when performed by trained
EPs.2–5 Moreover, we have the skill sets for ventilation,
airway management, and resuscitation that are neces-
sary to provide safe patient care should an adverse
event occur. Expertise in PSA is included as a core com-
petency in emergency medicine (EM) residency training
and pediatric EM fellowships.1
The use of various analgesic, sedative, and anesthetic
agents
has
been
outlined
in
several
guidelines.1,6,7
Numerous
classes
and
combinations
of
drugs
are
commonly used for PSA in the ED.2,8–21 The use of
short-acting sedative agents such as propofol,22,23 eto-
midate,21,24–27
and
ketamine,28–30
for
example,
has
gained widespread acceptance. The American College
of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) has developed a clini-
cal policy regarding PSA.1 Adverse event reporting for
PSA, however, has been heterogeneous.
Given the frequent use of PSA by EPs, as well as the
continued development of research and clinical evi-
dence for this practice, we conducted a systematic
review and meta-analysis to determine the incidence of
adverse events during PSA in the ED, including the fre-
quency of events associated with individual drugs and
different drug combinations. We anticipate that the
results of the review will provide useful information to
providers when performing PSA in a given patient,
when engaging in risk communication and shared deci-
sion-making, and in the informed consent process.
METHODS
Study Design
This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of stud-
ies reporting rates of adverse events for commonly used
sedation drugs in the ED. A protocol was written before
the beginning of the study. This report adheres to rec-
ommendations made in the Preferred Reporting Items
for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) statement.31
Eligibility Criteria
Types of Studies.
We sought original research stud-
ies, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and
observational studies, in which PSA was performed on
adults in the ED. Studies performed on patients under
18 years of age were excluded. We did not exclude any
studies based on language. We restricted the inclusion
to studies published after 2005 to decrease the variabil-
ity in medications used, depth of sedation, monitoring
during sedation (i.e., capnography), training and exper-
tise
of
providers
with
sedation,
and
definitions
of
adverse events. Studies reporting moderate and deep
sedation as defined per ACEP Clinical Policy were
included.1
Types of Patients and Procedures.
All types of medi-
cations used for moderate to deep PSA were included.
Procedures included orthopedic joint or fracture reduc-
tions, laceration repairs, chest tube insertion, electrical
cardioversion, abscess incision and drainage, chest tube
thoracostomy, upper endoscopy, lumbar puncture, for-
eign body removal, hemorrhoidectomy, burn wound
care,
hernia
reduction,
stool
disimpaction,
urinary
catheter placement, central line placement, nasopharyn-
goscopy, pelvic exam, and cervix dilation and curettage.
Types of Interventions.
To meet inclusion criteria, the
sedation had to be performed in the ED by emergency
providers, including EM residents, attending physicians,
and/or advance practice providers (nurse practitioners
or physician assistants). Drugs given alone or in combi-
nation, as intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) injec-
tion, were included. Drugs received prior to PSA were
not included as interventions (e.g., opioids in a patient
with fracture that later required fracture reduction with
sedation). Patients who received PSA were monitored
according to the guidelines of each individual research
protocol.
Study Protocol
Search Strategy.
A senior expert librarian designed
and conducted a comprehensive search of eight elec-
tronic
databases,
including
MEDLINE,
EMBASE,
EBSCO, CINAHL, CENTRAL, the Cochrane Database of
Systematic Reviews, Web of Science, and Scopus from
inception to January 23, 2015. The Medline search strat-
egy is included in Data Supplement S1 (available as sup-
porting information in the online version of this paper).
To identify trials, we searched Scopus (www.scopus.-
com/).
Study Selection.
In phase I, two investigators (WG,
PBM), working independently, screened all the titles
and abstracts for eligibility. References that were con-
sidered potentially relevant were retrieved in full text
and assessed for eligibility by two independent review-
ers in phase II. Any disagreements were discussed with
the clinical lead authors (EPH, MFB) and resolved by
consensus.
Data Extraction.
Data were extracted independently
and in duplicate using a standardized data form (see
Data Supplement S2, available as supporting informa-
tion in the online version of this paper). Disagreements
were resolved by discussion and consensus. Data col-
lected included study design and the incidence of each
reported adverse event. Data were compared between
the two reviewers, and discrepancies were resolved
through discussion. We collected details regarding the
medications used, including whether a single drug was
used (e.g., propofol) or a combination of drugs (e.g.,
propofol/ketamine). We recorded the total number of
patients experiencing events and the total number of
procedures performed.
Risk of Bias Assessment.
For RCTs, we assessed the
risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration bias
appraisal tool.32 We assessed the risk of bias for cohort
studies
using
the
Newcastle
Ottawa
scale.33
We
assessed clinical heterogeneity by determining whether
the characteristics of participants, interventions, out-
come measures, and timing of outcome measurement
were similar across studies.

Bellolio et al. • ADVERSE EVENTS IN ADULTS UNDERGOING PROCEDURAL SEDATION IN THE ED
 Missing Data.
We collected outcomes as included in
the published report and contacted authors by e-mail if
data were missing or unclear. If data were still missing
after attempting to contact the author, we classified the
study as unclear. If data were not reported for a particular
outcome, this was also noted in the data extraction form.
Variable Criteria of Outcomes.
The included studies
defined outcome events such as hypoxia and hypoten-
sion using different criteria. Data Supplement S3 (avail-
able as supporting information in the online version of
this paper) shows the definition used in each study. We
analyzed the outcomes based on the study definition.
For the outcome of hypoxia, there were studies that
defined it as an oxygen saturation of less than 85, 90,
92, 93, 94, and 95%. For the outcome of hypotension,
one
study
defined
it
as
systolic
blood
pressure
(sBP) < 70 mm Hg, others as < 90 mm Hg, and others
as < 100 mm Hg. Two studies used mean arterial pres-
sure instead of sBP.
Outcome Measures
In determining which adverse events to extract and
report, we followed previous reported outcomes in the
PSA literature and collaborated with a content expert
on PSA (JRM). After discussion, we reached consensus
on the following outcome measures: agitation, apnea,
aspiration,
bradycardia,
bradypnea,
hypotension,
hypoxia, intubation, laryngospasm, nausea, and vomit-
ing. Subclinical respiratory depression was not analyzed
as outcome but was recorded as a marker of more rig-
orous monitoring. It was defined as loss of end-tidal
CO2 (ETCO2) waveform or change in ETCO2 of more
than 10 mm Hg.
Data Analysis
We used OpenMeta[Analyst]34 software for meta-ana-
lyses following a random-effects model as described by
DerSimonian-Laird. I2 was used to quantify the degree
of statistical heterogeneity between studies. To account
for any heterogeneity in clinical and methodologic dif-
ferences between studies, we used a random-effects
model. Random-effects modeling uses a different for-
mula to calculate more conservative 95% confidence
intervals (CIs). The effects of treatment are assumed to
vary around some overall average treatment effect, as
opposed to a fixed-effects model, in which it is assumed
that each study has the same fixed common treatment
effect. We estimated the incidence per 1,000 patients
with 95% CI. When the number of events was zero, we
calculated the CI using the modified Wald method.35
We used Cohen’s unweighted kappa to measure chance
corrected agreement between reviewers for phase II of
the study selection process.
Subgroup Analysis.
Because of variation in the cutoff
and
definition
of
hypoxia
in
different
studies,
we
performed a subgroup analysis for the incidence of
hypoxia by oxygen saturation (SO2).
Sensitivity Analysis.
We performed the following a
priori selected sensitivity analyses, excluding observa-
tional studies and reporting results from RCTs, and for
studies that reported subclinical depression, we ana-
lyzed the results as a separate group.
RESULTS
Description of Included Studies
Figure 1 shows the study selection process. The search
strategy
identified
2,046
records
for
review.
After
screening the titles and abstracts and removing dupli-
cates, we identified 465 potentially relevant studies.
After full-text review, 55 articles met inclusion crite-
ria.8,9,13,17,19,21,27,29,30,36–81
Interobserver
agreement
(kappa) for phase II of the review was 0.99 (95%
CI = 0.98 to 1.0).
Study Characteristics
Data Supplement S4 (available as supporting informa-
tion in the online version of this paper) describes the 55
included studies. Twenty-five were RCTs and 30 were
observational
studies
(prospective
and
retrospective
cohorts and case series). The studies included 9,652
PSAs conducted in 9,577 patients (<1% underwent more
than one PSA).
Quality and Risk of Bias Assessment
The quality of randomized trials is included in Data Sup-
plement S5 (available as supporting information in the
online version of this paper), and the quality of cohort
studies in Data Supplement S6 (available as supporting
information in the online version of this paper). Most
studies had low to moderate risk of biases. We did not
exclude articles based on the quality assessment.
There was some clinical heterogeneity, as studies had
variable sample sizes, and there were different indica-
tions for sedation, including orthopedic joint or fracture
reductions,
laceration
repairs,
chest
tube
insertion,
abscess incision and drainage, upper endoscopy, and
lumbar puncture, among others. However, we thought
that it was reasonable to summarize the data, as the
procedures were all performed in the ED and required
patients to be sedated to tolerate the procedure. All
included studies were for moderate and deep sedations.
The timing for measurement of the outcomes was simi-
lar across studies, as sedation is a resource-intensive
and closely monitored procedure.
We
found
a
range
from
low
to
high
statistical
heterogeneity (heterogeneity quantified as I2 and dis-
played in Tables 1–3), with low statistical heterogeneity
in the outcomes of apnea, aspiration, bradycardia, intu-
bation, and laryngospasm; moderate heterogeneity in
the outcomes of agitation, hypotension, and vomiting;
and high statistical heterogeneity in the outcome of
hypoxia.
Outcomes
A total of 9,652 procedural sedations were included.
Table 1 shows the incidence of adverse events per 1,000
sedations. The most
frequent events were hypoxia,
vomiting, hypotension, and apnea. Hypoxia occurred in
40.2 per 1,000 sedations (95% CI = 32.5 to 47.9); vomit-
ing, 16.4 per 1,000 sedations (95% CI = 9.7 to 23.0);
hypotension, 15.2 per 1,000 sedations (95% CI = 10.7 to
19.7); and apnea 12.4 per 1,000 (95% CI = 7.9 to 16.9).

 Severe adverse events requiring emergent medical
intervention were rare, with one case of aspiration in
2,370 sedations (1.2 per 1,000), one case of laryn-
gospasm in 883 sedations (4.2 per 1,000), and two intu-
bations in 3,636 sedations (1.6 per 1,000). The incidence
of adverse events per medication used is displayed in
Table 2.
Results by Outcome
Agitation.
A total of 33 studies including 6,631 seda-
tions on 6,558 patients reported the outcome of agita-
tion. The incidence of agitation was 9.8 per 1,000 (95%
CI = 6.1 to 13.5). There were 25 of 997 patients who
received medication to treat agitation, with an incidence
of 27.1 per 1,000 (95% CI = 9.5 to 44.7). Ketamine and
ketamine/propofol had the highest rate of agitation.
Among the studies that used ketamine, the incidence of
agitation was 164.1 per 1,000 sedations (95% CI = 94.8
to 233.5), and among those receiving ketamine/propofol,
48.1 per 1,000 sedations (95% CI = 12.9 to 83.3; see Fig-
ure 2).8,9,13,21,27,30,36–64
Apnea.
Apnea was reported in 22 studies, comprising
68 events in 3,264 sedations on 3,264 patients. The inci-
dence was 12.4 per 1,000 sedations (95% CI = 7.9 to
16.9). The use of midazolam (51.4 per 1,000 sedations,
95% CI = 5.5 to 97.3) and the combination of midazo-
lam/opiate (25.9 per 1,000 sedations, 95% CI = 3.8 to
47.9) had the highest incidence of apnea (see Data Sup-
plement S7a, available as supporting information in the
online version of this paper, for forest plots of the inci-
dence of apnea by medication).
Aspiration.
A total of 10 studies including 2,370 seda-
tions on 2,370 patients reported the outcome of aspira-
tion. Aspiration occurred in one case (1.2 per 1,000
sedations, 95% CI = 0 to 2.6) receiving propofol and
fentanyl.
The case
of
aspiration
was
a
65-year-old
female
who
underwent
sedation
with
fentanyl
and
propofol for the reduction of an ankle fracture.36 The
first attempt to reduce the fracture was unsuccessful,
and the patient was sedated for a second time 1 hour
later. She vomited and aspirated, requiring intubation

 Hypotension.
A total of 27 studies including 5,801
sedations on 5,801 patients reported the outcome of
hypotension. The incidence was 15.2 per 1,000 sedations
(95% CI = 10.7 to 19.7).
The incidence was highest with the use of propofol
(19.1 per 1,000 sedation, 95% CI = 12 to 26.3) and mida-
zolam/opiate (15.4 per 1,000 sedations, 95% CI = 2.1 to
28.8).

Hypoxia
Hypoxia was reported in 42 studies, comprising 373
events in 7,116 sedations on 7,043 patients. The inci-
dence was 40.2 per 1,000 sedations (95% CI = 32.5 to
47.9). The incidence was highest with the use of propo-

Intubation
Nineteen studies reported the outcome of intubation
on 3,636 sedation and 3,636 patients. There were two
intubations (1.6 per 1,000 sedations, 95% CI = 0.3 to
2.9) that occurred in patients that received propofol.
One study37 described an intubation in a 18-year-old

Laryngospasm
Five studies including 883 sedations reported the out-
come of laryngospasm. Laryngospasm occurred in one
patient (4.2 per 1,000 sedations, 95% CI = 0 to 8.5) who
received ketamine and who was managed conserva-
tively per authors’ report.38
Vomiting
A total of 25 studies including 3,319 sedations on 3,319
patients reported vomiting. The incidence was 16.4 per
1,000 sedations (95% CI = 9.7 to 23.0). The use of keta-
mine (170.0 per 1,000 sedations) had the highest inci-
dence of vomiting (see Data Supplement S7b, available
as supporting information in the online version of this
paper, for the forest plot of the incidence of vomiting by
medication).

 Subgroup Analysis
A subgroup analysis was created based on each study’s
definition of hypoxia. Studies that had cut
off for
hypoxia of SO2 < 90% had an incidence of hypoxia 23.0
per 1,000 sedations, compared to cutoff of SO2 < 94%
with an incidence of 73.1 per 1,000 sedations and
SO2 < 95% with an incidence of 230.7 per 1,000 seda-
tions (see Data Supplement S8, available as supporting
information in the online version of this paper, for the
forest plot of the subgroup analysis of hypoxia by study
definition).
Sensitivity Analyses
After excluding 30 observational studies, a sensitivity
analysis of 25 RCTs was performed (see Table 3). When
analyzing the incidence of adverse events in PSA in
RCTs, we found that the incidence of most of the events
was significantly higher, i.e., agitation incidence of 41.1
versus 9.8 per 1,000 in the overall meta-analysis, apnea
21.5 versus 12.4, hypoxia 87.6 versus 40.2, and vomiting
62.3 versus 16.4. This difference in the incidence of
events does not appear to be related to the medication
used in the RCTs vs observational studies (chi-square
test p = 0.79).
A sensitivity analysis of 20 studies that reported mea-
sures of subclinical respiratory depression was per-
formed. The incidence of bradycardia (20.8 vs. 6.5 per
1,000), hypotension (32.4 vs. 15.2), hypoxia (99.7 vs.
40.2), and intubation (6.1 vs. 1.6) were higher in the sen-
sitivity analysis when compared to the overall meta-ana-
lysis (see Table 4).
DISCUSSION
We report the incidence of adverse events that occurred
during PSA conducted in the ED. We included 55 differ-
ent studies comprising nearly 10,000 sedations. The
incidence of severe adverse events requiring emergent
interventions such as laryngospasm, intubation, or aspi-
ration was low. We did not find any reported deaths in
this cohort of sedations in the ED. Severe adverse
events requiring emergent medical intervention were
infrequent, with one case of aspiration in 2,370 seda-
tions (1.2 per 1,000), one case of laryngospasm in 883
sedations (4.2 per 1,000), and two intubations in 3,636
sedations (1.6 per 1,000). Our results are similar to pre-
vious studies, where respiratory events leading to seri-
ous adverse outcomes, such as aspiration, unplanned
intubation, or cardiac arrest, were exceedingly rare.82,83
Emergency physicians are uniquely qualified to pro-
vide all levels of sedation.1 Safe and effective sedation
and analgesia in the ED is a critical skill that is core to
the practice of EM. Before performing PSA, the clini-
cian should discuss the risks, benefits, and alternatives
of the procedure and the planned sedation with the
patient. Data from this review will help inform the clini-
cian and the patient regarding the incidence of compli-
cations and side effects of PSA.
Successful performance requires recognition of not
only pitfalls associated with the medications but also
consideration for the complexity of patients’ underlying
physiology and degree of illness or injury. Patients that
require PSA in the ED are at increased risk of complica-
tions secondary to the emergent nature of the condi-
tions that brought them to the ED and the need for pain
and anxiety management to successfully accomplish an
intervention or diagnostic procedure. The high-risk nat-
ure and comorbidities in these patients may include
underlying cardiopulmonary disorders, multiple trauma,
head trauma, or intoxication.1
Detectable respiratory events such as hypoxia and
apnea are common and may be precursors of more
serious events during PSA.11,39,84,85 In an attempt to
minimize these adverse events further, the routine use
of capnography monitoring during PSA has been rec-
ommended,1 as capnography allows the detection of
hypoventilation and apnea earlier than pulse oximetry
and/or clinical assessment alone.39 Similar to the find-
ings of the ACEP policy group, our sensitivity analysis
evaluating the incidence of events in studies that mea-
sured and reported subclinical respiratory depression
showed
higher
rates
of
hypoxia
in
these
patients.
Moderate to deep sedation can cause respiratory and
cardiovascular
depression,1
and
it
is
possible
that
patients in the studies that measured subclinical respira-
tory depression had overall better monitoring and more
strict reporting and surveillance of findings and might
explain the higher incidence of hypoxia, bradycardia,
and hypotension in these studies. When analyzing the
incidence of adverse events in PSA in RCTs, we found
that the incidence of agitation, apnea, bradycardia,
hypotension,
hypoxia,
and
vomiting
were
higher.
A higher incidence in RCTs is likely secondary to more
rigorous reporting, the prospective nature of the trials,
the existence of a protocol, more complete reporting,
and less bias than observational studies.
ACEP has established their evidence in adult PSA as
a Level A recommendation for the use of propofol, Level
B for etomidate and the combination of propofol and
ketamine, and Level C for the use of ketamine alone.
Brief-acting sedative agents confer shorter periods of
impaired levels of consciousness86–88 and subsequently
less risk for adverse respiratory events.1,2,89–91 An addi-
tional benefit to shorter periods of patient impaired
consciousness is a reduction of patient monitoring time
that allows reduced allocation of intense patient moni-
toring periods by medical and nursing staff.1 We found

 that there is not a single agent or combination that out-
performs compared to the others: agitation was higher
with ketamine (27 per 1,000 required medications to
treat periprocedural agitation), apnea was higher with
midazolam combined with opiates, and bradycardia was
higher with etomidate and midazolam combined with
opiates. Hypotension occurred with all the medications
used for sedation and was higher with propofol and
midazolam combined with opiates. Hypoxia was more
frequent with propofol and midazolam. The case of
laryngospasm was in a patient that received ketamine,
and the aspiration and intubations were in patients
receiving propofol.
Previous studies suggested benefit when combining
propofol with ketamine, including reduction in hypoten-
sion and respiratory depression secondary to increases
in
circulatory
norepinephrine
induced
by
ketamine,
decrease in vomiting and agitation by the antiemetic
and anxiolytic properties of propofol, and reduction in
concomitant analgesic needs.8,9,13,18,40,41,89,92 In our sys-
tematic review, when propofol and ketamine were com-
bined,
the
incidence
of
agitation,
apnea,
hypoxia,
bradycardia, hypotension, and vomiting were lower
compared to each medication separately.
These data provide useful information when allocat-
ing resources at the bedside and training providers. The
data can also inform providers and assist in communi-
cating the risks of the procedures, in engaging patients
in shared decision-making, and in obtaining informed
consent for procedural sedation. To help inform the
patients at our institution, we have created a pocket
card for the providers who will be conducting the
procedural sedation; this tool has been received favor-
ably by our patients and physicians. The pocket card
(see online Data Supplement S9, available as supporting
information in the online version of this paper) and a
link to a video that demonstrates how to provide this
information
to
patients
is
available:
https://www.
youtube.com/watch?v=dxMldyOgzpc&feature=youtu.be.
In adults presenting to the ED, sedation is safe and
effective in providing increased patient comfort and
ease of procedural performance. The safest and most
effective medication or combination of medications for
sedation is yet to be determined. No single drug is ideal
for all situations. Consensus for standardizing defini-
tions for reporting adverse events in PSA among adult
and pediatric patients needs to be reached and imple-
mented to better compare the optimal agents between
studies.93
LIMITATIONS
There were limitations in the included studies, as well
as in our review. The major limitations are the variation
in the definitions for the outcomes that were provided
in the studies. There is lack of standardization in the
reporting of the outcomes, and this may impact the esti-
mates. Not all studies reported all the outcomes of inter-
est in the meta-analysis. Studies using capnography and
other measures of subclinical respiratory depression are
likely to detect hypoxia and respiratory events earlier
than those that did not reported measures of subclinical
respiratory depression. When hypoxia is defined as SO2
lower than 95%, the incidence is 10 times higher (231
per 1,000 than when we define hypoxia as lower than
90% (23 per 1,000). The higher rates are because of
higher sensitivity of the detection of hypoxia with cutoff
of 95%. The need for intervention after hypoxia, nausea,
and hypotension were not explicitly reported in each
study. Subclinical respiratory depression was analyzed
in the sensitivity analyses but was not used as an out-
come,
as
the
occurrence
of
subclinical
respiratory
depression is unlikely to directly impact patient out-
comes.
We
included
all
types
of
procedures
that
required sedation, such as electrical cardioversion for
unstable patients, orthopedic fracture, or dislocation
reductions, etc., increasing the clinical heterogeneity
between studies but also increasing the applicability of
the findings to ED practice.
Regarding limitations in the systematic review, there
were not enough events in some of the medication cate-
gories to determine if the risk of the adverse event was
higher with certain medications or medication combina-
tions. When pooling rates from studies with very infre-
quent events, instead of performing a meta-analysis
with weighted mean across studies with the weight
derived from the variance, we reported a simple pro-
portion in which the numerator is the sum of events
and denominator is the sum of sample sizes to avoid
the pooled rate become distorted. To decrease selection
bias, we included all eligible studies, particularly those
with low number of participants. This likely introduced
heterogeneity into the analyses. However, we assessed
clinical and statistical heterogeneity and accounted for
this in the statistical analyses.
To mitigate some of these limitations, we used sensi-
tivity analyses based on study design (randomized trials)
and subclinical respiratory depression and one sub-
group analysis based on study definition of hypoxia. We
limited the review to studies of adults and excluded
those with mixed adult and pediatric populations and
only included studies published in the past 10 years. We
focused on potentially serious outcomes in patients
undergoing moderate and deep sedation.
CONCLUSIONS
Serious
adverse
events
such
as
intubation,
laryn-
gospasm, and aspiration during procedural sedation
and analgesia in the ED are exceedingly rare. These
data summarize the available literature and provide
quantitative risk estimates to facilitate shared decision-
making, risk communication, and informed consent.
