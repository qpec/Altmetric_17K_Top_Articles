Abstract 
Background: There is an urgent need to identify the earliest biological changes within the 
neuropathological cascade of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) processes.  Recent findings in a 
murine model of AD showed significant preclinical loss of dopaminergic neurons in the 
ventral tegmental area (VTA), accompanied by reduced hippocampal innervation and 
declining memory.  It is unknown if these observations can be translated in humans. 
Objective: We tested the hypothesis that VTA volume is associated with the typical clinical 
markers of AD in a cohort of patients and healthy controls. 
Methods: Structural and resting state functional MRI scans, and neuropsychological scores 
were acquired for 51 healthy adults, 30 patients with a diagnosis of mild cognitive 
impairment, and 29 patients with a diagnosis of AD dementia.  VTA volume was quantified 
together with other control nuclei.  The association between nuclei volume, hippocampal 
size, memory performance, and linguistic-executive skills was tested. The effect of VTA 
functional connectivity was also tested. 
Results: VTA size, but not of control nuclei, yielded a strong association with both 
hippocampal size and memory competence (but not linguistic-executive performance), and 
this was particularly strong in healthy adults.  In addition, functional connectivity between 
the VTA and hippocampus was significantly associated with both markers of AD. 
Conclusion: Diminished dopaminergic VTA activity may be crucial for the earliest 
pathological features of AD and might suggest new strategies for early treatment.  Memory 
encoding processes may represent cognitive operations susceptible to VTA 
neurodegeneration.

INTRODUCTION 
The epidemiological and economic burden of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) increases [1], 
but the exact mechanisms by which the initial neuropathological changes are triggered are 
still elusive.  The “classic” amyloid-� cascade hypothesis posits that it is the abnormal 
accumulation of this protein in parenchymal regions that induces all subsequent changes in 
neural structure and function seen in AD.  This hypothesis is currently at the center of a 
scientific debate, with evidence in its support [2], and research conclusions, which, instead, 
do not sustain its claims [3].  A crucial aspect in the identification of the ontogenesis of the 
disease is certainly a progressive shift towards the characterization of the earliest preclinical 
stages of AD (i.e., when individuals are in their early adulthood, or even earlier).  This has 
been pursued both to clarify the causing mechanisms, but also to find an early disease 
marker, that may be of assistance in the diagnostic process.  Although focusing on the genetic 
form of AD is by far the most convenient approach to study preclinical AD in humans (young 
carriers of a mutation in one of the AD-related genetic loci will inevitably go on developing 
the disease), the study of sporadic preclinical AD (not necessarily bound to its genetic forms) 
is instead a much more effortful enterprise that demands large cohorts and long study 
durations.  On this note, only a few studies have identified variables that could be exploitable 
in a clinical setting and, at the same time, shed light on the mechanism behind the neurotoxic 
cascade of AD.  A prominent finding emerged from this type of research is that showing that 
an impoverishment of lexical-semantic abilities during early adulthood is a significant 
predictor of AD pathology at post-mortem [4].  A second finding has emerged from detailed 
histological analysis of brain tissue: non fibrillar precursors of abnormal TAU protein are 
detected in early adulthood (i.e., “pre-tangle” material) in brainstem nuclei, especially in the 
locus coeruleus [5].  In an attempt to identify a preclinical marker, we tested a hypothesis 
derived from the results of a study published very recently.  In their manuscript, Nobili and 
 5 
 
colleagues found that, in a mouse model of the disease, very early anatomical changes are 
present in a subcortical brain region rich in dopaminergic neurons, the ventral tegmental area 
(VTA), or ventral tegmentum [6].  Specifically, neuronal loss seems to be present in this area 
prior to any deposition of amyloid-� plaques.  Moreover, this is accompanied by reduced 
dopaminergic innervation to the hippocampus, and decreased memory performance [6].  
Although this was found in a group of transgenic mice carriers of an AD related genetic 
mutation, the principle that a dopaminergic process may be a prime mechanism that 
contributes to triggering the neurotoxic cascade would be a valid principle in any form of 
AD.  On these grounds, we thus transposed and tested this hypothesis in a sample of humans. 
We hypothesized that the size of the VTA, estimated with a volumetric index, obtained from 
magnetic resonance imaging, would be significantly associated with the size of the 
hippocampus and with performance on a test of episodic memory.  We also tested whether 
VTA functional connectivity would co-vary with memory performance and hippocampal 
volume. 
 
 
MATERIAL AND METHODS 
Participants 
A cohort of 110 individuals was included in this study.  These had been recruited at 
the Royal Hallamshire Hospital (Sheffield, UK), as part of the EU-funded research initiative 
Virtual Physiological Human: DementiA Research Enabled by IT (www.vph-dare.eu/; see 
Acknowledgments section).  Of those included in this cohort, fifty-one were heathy adults 
free from neurological symptoms or cognitive complaints.  Other twenty-nine were patients 
 6 
 
with a clinical diagnosis of mild/moderate AD dementia.  The remaining thirty participants 
were patients with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) of the single-domain 
amnestic type (n = 1), multiple-domain amnestic type (n = 12), single-domain non-amnestic 
type (n = 7), multiple-domain non-amnestic type (n = 10), that could not be accounted for by 
neurovascular, psychiatric, metabolic or traumatic reasons [7].  The clinical profile of these 
patients (detailed by a senior neurologist and a senior clinical neuropsychologist) was 
strongly indicative of underlying AD pathology as the main etiology causing their symptoms, 
and the diagnostic criteria for MCI due to AD were applied to classify each of these 30 
patients as prodromal AD [8].  Specifically, all patients had been followed up clinically at 
regular intervals for at least two and a half years for the confirmation of the diagnosis. 
Each participant completed a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol (see subsequent 
section) and an extensive battery of cognitive tests, to comply with study criteria and clinical 
profiling (illustrated in Table 1).  Of these, two indices of cognitive competence were 
extracted from the battery of tests: the performance on the Prose Memory test (the average of 
the immediate and delayed recall scores, as well as immediate and delayed recall scores taken 
separately) as a measure of verbal episodic memory [9], and the performance on the Letter 
Fluency test as a measure of language and executive functioning not reliant on the 
hippocampus [10].  Raw scores on these two tests were converted into z scores based on the 
mean and standard deviation of the entire cohort, with the following formula zx = (xi – �) / �..  
Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores [11] were also extracted from each 
assessment.

This study received ethical approval from the Yorkshire and Humber Regional Ethics 
Committee, Ref No: 12/YH/0474.  Written informed consent was obtained from all 
participants prior to enrollment. 
 
MRI Acquisition 
Each participant underwent an MRI research protocol (Philips Achieva, 3 T) inclusive 
of anatomical and functional image sequences.  Of these, T1-weighted and resting-state fMRI 
images were the acquisition types suitable to address the planned experimental question. 
T1-weighted images were acquired with the following parameters: voxel size: 0.94 mm × 
0.94 mm × 1.00 mm; repetition time: 8.2 s; echo delay time: 3.8 s; field of view: 256 mm; 
matrix size: 256 × 256 × 170. 
Resting-state fMRI images were based on 125 volumes, acquired with the following 
specifications: TR 2.6 s, TE 35 ms, flip angle 90°, voxel dimensions 1.80 × 1.80 × 4.00 mm, 
field of view 230 mm, 35 slices per volume. 
 
MRI Processing 
Image processing was carried out with Matlab (Mathworks Inc., UK) and Statistic 
Parametric Mapping 12 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK).  The T1-
weighted MRI sequence was processed with standard voxel-based morphometry [12].  
Images were initially segmented to separate the maps of gray matter, white matter, and 
cerebrospinal fluid, were registered to the Montreal Neurological Institute anatomical 
template, and were smoothed with an 8 mm full-width at half maximum Gaussian kernel.  
 8 
 
The volumes of the three tissue class maps in the native space were quantified using the 
“get_totals” Matlab function (http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/g.ridgway/vbm/get_totals.m).  
These were added up to obtain the total intracranial volume and, in turn, the global gray 
matter ratio. 
Volumes of interest were drawn using the PickAtlas toolbox and the Brodmann’s atlas [13].  
The VTA was defined in the Montreal Neurological Institute space as a spherical volume of 3 
mm radius centered at x = 0, y = -16, z = -7, as implemented in previous research [14, 15].  
Additional regions were selected as methodological control (Fig.1).  These were the red 
nucleus (RN), based on its proximity to the VTA, and the substantia nigra (SN), another 
region rich in dopaminergic neurons which had been found to not play any role in the pre-
plaque stage in the study by Nobili and colleagues [6].  Mean gray matter signal intensity was 
then extracted from each volume of interest with MarsBaR [16], as done in previous research 
(e.g., [17]).  Since regional volumes are influenced by head size, these were normalized to 
ratios of the brainstem.  To do so, a brainstem mask was created using PickAtlas, and 
volumes were extracted using the “get_totals” script.

Hippocampal volumes were calculated using Similarity and Truth Estimation for Propagated 
Segmentations (STEPS), an automated procedure that segments the hippocampus from 
native-space anatomical images based on multiple templates 
(http://cmictig.cs.ucl.ac.uk/niftyweb/).  STEPS outperforms other methodologies on the 
segmentation of the hippocampus, and generates results that closely resemble those of 
 9 
 
manual segmentation [18].  Fig.2 illustrates two examples of the use of this procedure.  Each 
of the 110 outputs was visually inspected for quality control.  The “get_totals” Matlab 
function was used to convert the output files into a volumetric index.  This was partialized 
based on total intracranial volumes, and left and right hippocampal ratios were averaged to 
obtain a global hippocampal ratio.

Resting state T2* images, indexing the haemodynamic properties of the brain, were 
preprocessed following a standardized methodology, as described elsewhere (e.g., [19]).  
Briefly. raw images were initially slice-timed and realigned to even out temporal and spatial 
variability in the acquisition process.  A normalization followed, during which scans were 
registered to the Montreal Neurological Institute space.  A band-pass filter was then applied 
to retain the range of frequencies relevant for neural signal (0.01 – 0.1 Hz).  Finally, filtered 
scans were smoothed with a 6 mm full-width at half-maximum Gaussian kernel.  The 
hemodynamic timecourse within each voxel was modelled as a function of the signal of the 
VTA, regressing out the signal coming from white matter and cerebrospinal fluid, and in-
scanner motion parameters. 
 
Modelling 
Nonparametric correlation models were run to test the association between each 
anatomical ratios (VTA ratio, RN ratio, and SN ratio) and the neurocognitive features of AD 
 10 
 
(hippocampal ratio, memory performance, and, as control measure, linguistic-executive 
performance).  The threshold for statistical significance of the Spearman’s rho coefficients 
accounted for nine (3 nuclei × 3 models) independent correlations (p < 0.005).  Since healthy 
controls were significantly more educated than patients, education-corrected Spearmann’s 
rho coefficients were also calculated.  MMSE scores were added as second covariate in the 
models testing the correlation between hippocampal ratio and the size ratio of the nuclei.  
Since a very strong correlation existed between MMSE and Prose Memory scores (rho = 
0.788, p = 1.64e-24), the correlation models testing the association between memory 
performance and VTA ratio were not corrected for MMSE. 
To reach a better understanding of the structural and functional relation between each nucleus 
and the rest of the brain, other analyses were run.  First, the structural covariance of the VTA 
and the other nuclei was explored.  This served to understand what pattern of regions tend to 
covariate in volumetric terms with each nucleus.  Voxel-by-voxel regression models were 
carried out across the entire cohort, in which gray matter maps were modelled as a function 
of the size of each nucleus.  The score on the Mini Mental State Examination was used as a 
correction factor for these analyses. 
Second, maps of VTA functional connectivity were analysed.  This was done as a function of 
the normalized hippocampal ratio and memory performance, in the entire cohort and within 
each diagnostic group.  Age, education levels, and gray matter ratios were included as 
covariates in each model.  Scores on the Mini Mental State Examination were added as 
further covariate in the model run in the whole cohort.

RESULTS 
Correlation models 
The three groups are characterized in Table 1.  No significant difference was found 
among the three groups in the size of the VTA ratio, RN ratio, or SN ratio.  In the entire 
cohort, the hippocampal ratio was significantly associated with the VTA ratio (rho(n = 110) = 
0.482, p = 9.88e-08, Fig.3a; education and MMSE-corrected rho(df = 106) = 0.427, p = 4.00e-
06).  This was replicated only in the groups of healthy controls (rho(n = 51)  = 0.586, p = 6.00e-
06, Fig 4a; education and MMSE-corrected rho(df = 47) = 0.415, p = 0.003).  In the entire 
cohort the association between the VTA ratio and the memory index was significant (rho(n = 
110) = 0.290, p = 0.002, Fig.3c; education-corrected rho(df = 107) = 0.291, p = 0.002), while 
neither the other ratios nor the performance on the Letter Fluency test showed significant 
associations (Fig.3b, d, f).  Focusing on each diagnostic group, no significant associations 
were found in the two patient groups (Fig.4b-c, e-f).  Similarly, no effect emerged after the 
MCI group was separated into amnestic and non-amnestic patients.  In the group of healthy 
adults, memory scores (but not Letter Fluency scores) correlated with the SN ratio (rho(n = 51) 
= 0.428, p = 0.002; education-corrected rho(df = 48) = 0.380, p = 0.007), but the association 
with the VTA ratio was far stronger (rho(n = 51) = 0.495, p = 2.25e-04, Fig.4g; education-
corrected rho(df = 48) = 0.474, p = 0.001).  To characterize the role of encoding and retrieval 
mechanisms in this pattern of findings, the analyses were then re-run separately for z scores 
derived separately for immediate and delayed recall.  The only associations which survived 
the p < 0.005 statistical threshold were those between immediate recall and VTA ratio in the 
entire cohort (rho(n = 110) = 0.294, p = 0.002, Fig.3e; education-corrected rho(df = 107) = 0.296, 
p = 0.002) and in the group of healthy controls (rho(n = 51) = 0.483, p = 3.33e-04, Fig, 4j; 
 12 
 
education-corrected rho(df = 48) = 0.460, p = 0.001).  The association between VTA ratio and 
delayed recall only approached statistical significance.

Structural covariance of the VTA 
The structural covariance of the VTA extended to hippocampus, insula, and medial

the nuclei themselves (Fig.5).

Functional connectivity of the VTA 
In the whole cohort hippocampal volume (Fig.6a) and memory performance (Fig.6b) 
were associated with the functional connectivity between the VTA and the left hippocampus.  
Memory performance was also associated with the functional connectivity between the VTA 
and the medial prefrontal cortex.  The association was very similar when immediate and 
delayed recall were used as predictors. 
Albeit the analysis of the subgroup of healthy controls revealed a set of trends qualitatively 
similar to those of the global analyses, the findings emerging from the analyses limited to 
each diagnostic group did not reach any statistical significance.

DISCUSSION 
The findings of this study provide confirmatory evidence from humans in support of a 
significant role of the VTA in the preclinical phase of the sporadic form of AD, specifically 
in predicting variability of the typical neurocognitive features of the disease, i.e., 
hippocampal size and memory ability.  Strong correlations were found in the group of healthy 
individuals, but not in MCI or AD dementia patients.  This is in line with the evidence of 
VTA neuronal loss occurring very early along the disease timeline.  In fact, it is expected that 
only in an asymptomatic population there will be sufficient variability to enable the 
significant associations to emerge.  No similar association was found between the SN ratio 
and the hippocampus, indicating that it is not a generic volumetric decrease of dopaminergic 
nuclei associated with hippocampal reduction but, rather, a specific involvement of the VTA 
in the preclinical stage of AD, as originally found in a murine model [6].  This confirmatory 
evidence of a selective involvement of the VTA is particularly important because research 
strives for the detection of a preclinical marker of sporadic AD and novel paradigms of 
investigation are needed [20]. 
To contextualize the findings of this study in a manner that can be functionally relevant (i.e., 
what exact cognitive function is sustained by the VTA and, thus, could be potentially 
exploited for a preclinical diagnosis of AD), it is informative to address first the anatomy of 
this region and the connections it forms.  The VTA is a group of heterogeneous 
mesencephalic nuclei located in the midbrain, 163 mm3 large in humans, and counting about 
 14 
 
690,000 neurons [21].  The major component (≈ 55%) are dopaminergic cells [22], while the 
remaining part is mainly composed by GABAergic neurons that serve as regulatory inhibitory 
control [23].  The dopaminergic neurons of the VTA project directly to a series of regions, 
including the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, hippocampus, and the medial prefrontal cortex 
[24].  These connections are at the basis of the role of the VTA as a circuital hub in support 
of a number of functions, e.g., reward mechanisms [25] and emotional processing [26], and in 
behavioral and psychiatric disorders in which deficits of these functions are a central trait, 
such as in schizophrenia [27] or craving behavior [28].  In AD, however, it is the depletion of 
dopaminergic innervation to the hippocampus that is the major pathological change [6].  This 
finds confirmation in the results of this study.  In fact, the anatomical variability of this 
regions was found to be profoundly linked to distinctive features of AD widely and routinely 
implemented in clinical settings, i.e., the smaller the VTA, the worse these indices. 
In human participants, the VTA-hippocampus interplay is normally visible via the analysis of 
functional connectivity [29, 30].  Based on this, if preclinical AD caused neuronal loss in the 
VTA, the VTA-hippocampus functional pathways should suffer considerably and would be 
quantifiable via measures of hemodynamic connectivity.  This would also be in line with the 
early histological conceptualizations of AD, described as a syndrome that isolates the 
hippocampal formation computationally [31].  Our findings confirmed this hypothesis, since 
the functional connectivity between the VTA and the left hippocampus was associated with 
both hippocampal size and memory performance.  It has to be acknowledged that we could 
not replicate this finding in the group of healthy controls, but, in all likelihood, this was due 
to a marked decrease in statistical power consequential to the reduction of sample size.  
Memory performance was also associated with the functional connectivity between the VTA 
and the medial prefrontal cortex.  The medial prefrontal cortex is one of the regions that 
 15 
 
receives dopaminergic innervation from the VTA [24].  This is also consistent with the role 
of this structure in long-term memory processes [32]. 
To put these findings even more in context, it is important to review the recent literature on 
VTA research.  As outlined in the following section, not only does the evidence collected in 
recent studies support our findings, but it also suggests that the computational role of the 
VTA-hippocampus pathway appears to be particularly relevant for pathological and clinical 
processes of early-stage AD.  On one hand, in fact, findings indicate that, in the initial stages 
of disease, neuronal loss in subcortical nuclei is at least as intense as in the mediotemporal 
complex [33].  This may account for the significant structural covariance we found between 
the VTA and the hippocampal formation (Fig.4).  On the other hand, convergent evidence 
associated with the role of the VTA-hippocampus loop is suggestive of a specific cognitive 
component that could be the key aspect for a preclinical diagnosis.  The computational role of 
the VTA-hippocampus pathway, in fact, seems to be particularly relevant for material that is 
associated with a degree of novelty [34].  Specifically, evidence has shown that the VTA-
hippocampus interaction is somehow involved in the encoding phase of memory [35].  The 
encoding phase of mnestic processes consists of the exposure to and acquisition of new 
stimuli [36].  Obviously, it is widely established that the role of declarative memory 
impairment is central in AD when memory is intended as a global function (without 
separating the mechanisms of encoding, retrieval, and storage).  However the identification of 
a memory-related mechanism of clinical relevance during the preclinical stage is a hard task, 
as this stage is asymptomatic.  Longitudinal evidence indicates that, among healthy adults, 
measures of episodic memory are the best predictors of subsequent conversion to the early 
symptomatic stage of AD [37].  The simple retrospective use of neuropsychological tests, 
however, does not allow a clear separation between encoding and retrieval efficiency.  It is 
generally established, however, that measures of immediate recall of a short story (which 
 16 
 
constitute the Prose Memory test) rely more on encoding than retrieval, as opposed to 
measures of delayed recall that rely more on retrieval.  We thus explored the association 
between VTA ratio and immediate and delayed recall performance, separately.  The findings 
indicate that immediate recall was the only score significantly associated with the VTA.  This 
corroborates the role of encoding as pivotal cognitive indicator of early VTA disruption.  The 
neural system supporting memory encoding has been characterized with fMRI paradigms, 
since these allow a temporal separation of the distinct memory phases.  Under normal 
conditions, the hippocampal and perirhinal cortices play a major role during episodic 
encoding [38, 39].  A recent fMRI study characterized the profile of AD pathology associated 
with abnormal encoding (de-activation preceding hits and increased activation preceding 
false alarms) in healthy elderly adults, potentially presymptomatic AD individuals.  Findings 
indicated that abnormal encoding was associated with the presence of a Braak stage I/II, as 
measured with neuromolecular TAU imaging [40], indicating that the encoding stage is 
particularly informative.  In this scenario, if perirhinal and hippocampal activation supports 
encoding, the connectivity between these areas and the VTA has been found to support the 
consolidation of encoded material [41]. 
To draw a parallel with the aforementioned description of the role of the VTA in episodic 
encoding, the role of the VTA in semantic encoding would also be relevant, as semantic 
material can also be characterized by a degree of novelty, if the experimental paradigm is 
appropriately designed.  With remarkable convergence, the VTA was found to be the center 
of repeated semantic encoding for novel material [42].  This is unmistakable evidence that a 
paradigm of episodic memory encoding and semantic memory encoding might be the main 
neuropsychological candidate for the detection of VTA suffering.  The specific involvement 
of the encoding and consolidation of episodic and semantic material during the preclinical 
stage of AD is interlaced with two unconfutable facts that help corroborate the role of this 
 17 
 
specific cognitive function and, in turn, the VTA as prime suspect of preclinical AD.  Firstly, 
patients with AD show particular difficulties with episodic material encoded in recent, rather 
than remote past [43, 44], as to draw a trait of gradual failure in day-to-day encoding abilities.  
Secondly, the concept of semantic encoding for novel material resembles profoundly the 
operations requested by educational and academic activities.  In other words, it is through 
education that a major amount of novel semantic knowledge gets encoded.  Albeit novel 
semantics is encoded and stored throughout the entire life, this process arguably becomes less 
and less engaged during the course of adulthood.  On this note, if the preclinical stage of AD 
consists of a reduction of semantic encoding abilities, then it is unsurprising that low levels of 
education are one of the crucial risk factors for developing the disease.  This may shed new 
light on the role of education levels as integral part of the concept of cognitive reserve, a 
well-established protecting factor for the onset of AD symptoms [45]. 
Although this multidimensional set of findings converges towards a robust association 
between the clinical markers of AD and the size of the VTA, it has to be acknowledged that 
no significant differences were found between the VTA ratio of healthy controls and patients.  
This may be due to a multitude of reasons.  Firstly, since neuronal loss in the VTA is a 
presymptomatic occurrence, the variability in VTA size should be informative only in the 
group of healthy controls.  Secondly, when genetics is not characterized, groups of 
asymptomatic controls are necessarily heterogeneous, as they may include healthy adults as 
well as presymptomatic individuals.  As a consequence, the volumetric properties of the VTA 
may reflect either a nucleus that had not been subjected to any significant neuronal loss, or, 
viceversa, a degenerated nucleus that has lost a considerable number of neurons in 
comparison with its premorbid status.  On these grounds, a cross-sectional between groups 
comparison of VTA size yields limitations and would not be a valid source of information.  
Longitudinal studies would provide complementary insight, and would also shed light on the 
 18 
 
connection between reduced dopaminergic input to the mediotemporal regions and possible 
enhanced susceptibility of these regions to the deposition of the distinctive peptidic 
hallmarks. 
The dopaminergic nature of the neural pathways involved in preclinical AD is suggestive of 
potential intervention routes.  These, however, should be designed to target the system with 
appropriate timing, i.e., when the disease is at the preclinical stage.  Vice versa, dopaminergic 
therapies introduced at the dementia stage are not expected to be effective. Proof of this is the 
unsatisfactory outcome of dopaminergic trials for the treatment of AD in the form of 
seligiline [46].  Other monoamine oxidase inhibitor B molecules have been objet of research 
interest for AD for the regulation of dopaminergic activity, alone and in combination with the 
conventional cholinergic approach [47-49].  More investigations are needed to study these 
early changes more in detail, and more clinical studies based on a dopaminergic framework 
of AD are warranted. 
In conclusion, the pre-plaque VTA neuronal loss seen in a rodent model of AD [6] finds here 
confirmatory support in a human cohort.  Today, novel approaches to study the preclinical 
biological changes of AD are urgently needed [20].  The VTA and the VTA-hippocampal 
loop are hereby outlined and confirmed as potential preclinical markers of AD that deserve to 
be investigated more in detail.  Clinical focus on memory encoding might provide a 
neuropsychological measure of assistance.  In addition, the dopaminergic nature of this 
circuit might be suggestive of novel and effective early therapeutic avenues.

*One-way ANOVA and chi-square tests were used. MCI: Mild Cognitive Impairment.  Aside from Gender Ratio, means and standard deviations 
are indicated for each variable.  Ratio indices of each sub-cortical nucleus was calculated based on the volume of brainstem space.  Hippocampal 
ratios reported here are based on the use of the STEPS procedure

Artwork 
Fig.1: The regions included in this study identified by masks superimposed to the MNI 
anatomical template.  The RN, SN and VTA are shown in red, green and blue, respectively.  
Each axial slice (Montreal Neurological Institute coordinates from the top left: z = -12, -10, -
8, -6, clockwise) is identified on the orthogonal view by the shade of yellow/orange. 
 
Fig.2: Two examples of hippocampal segmentation using STEPS.  Hippocampal volumes 
were calculated based on the T1-weighted image in its native space.  These two examples 
show the segmentation of the left hippocampus of a patient with AD dementia (A) and a 
healthy control (B).  Slices are shown with and without the hippocampal overlay. 
 
Fig.3: The linear association models carried out in the entire cohort: between the 
hippocampal ratio and VTA ratio (a), between the hippocampal ratio and SN ratio (b), 
between the scores on the Prose Memory test (average of immediate and delayed recall) and 
VTA ratio (c), between the scores on the Prose Memory test (average of immediate and 
delayed recall) and SN ratio (d), between immediate recall scores and VTA ratio (e), and 
between the scores on the Letter Fluency test and VTA ratio (f).  Although the figure 
illustrates linear associations, nonlinear associations were run as part of the methodology.  
Ratios were scaled up (multiplied by 103).  Models testing the association between RN ratio 
and clinical indices of AD are not shown. 
 
Fig.4: The linear association models between the VTA ratio and hippocampal ratio in the 
group of healthy controls (a), MCI patients (b), and patients with dementia (c).  This is 
 30 
 
followed by the linear association between the SN ratio and hippocampal ratio in the group of 
healthy controls (d), MCI patients (e), and patients with dementia (f).  Immediately below, 
the linear association between the VTA ratio and scores on the Prose Memory test (average 
of immediate and delayed recall) in the group of healthy controls (g), MCI patients (h), and 
patients with dementia (i), and, specifically, between immediate recall and VTA ratio in the 
group of healthy controls (j), MCI patients (k), and patients with dementia (l).  The linear 
association between the VTA ratio and scores on the Letter Fluency test are shown at the 
bottom in the group of healthy controls (m), MCI patients (n), and patients with dementia (o).  
Although the figure illustrates linear associations, nonlinear associations were run as part of 
the methodology. Ratios were scaled up (multiplied by 103).  Models testing the association 
between RN ratio and clinical indices of AD are not shown. 
 
Fig.5: Structural covariance of the VTA (blue, Montreal Neurological Institute coordinates: y 
= -26, x = 0), SN (green, Montreal Neurological Institute coordinates: y = -10, x = 4) and RN 
(orange, Montreal Neurological Institute coordinates y = -20, x = 4).  These findings survive 
a Family Wise Error corrected p < 0.001. 
 
Fig.6: Functional connectivity of the VTA as a function of hippocampal volume (a. Montreal 
Neurological Institute coordinates: z = -22, x = -29, y = -6) and memory performance (b. 
Montreal Neurological Institute coordinates: z = 9, x = -23, y = -26).  These findings are 
significant with an uncorrected p < 0.01.
