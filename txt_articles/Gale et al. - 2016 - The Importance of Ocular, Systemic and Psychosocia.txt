A
comprehensive list of patient features that influence the management of patients with diabetic macular oedema (DMO) is discussed. 
These features are grouped into three overarching themes: ocular, systemic and psychosocial. Consensus statements about the 
relative importance of these features, supported by the literature, were formed by a panel of retinal experts. The major drivers 
influencing the management of DMO with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy are undoubtedly ocular specific, in 
particular visual acuity and optical coherence tomography (OCT) central retinal thickness. Systemic factors, such as control of glycated 
haemoglobin (HbA1c), blood pressure and serum lipid estimations, have limited direct influence on DMO management although they remain 
important considerations to communicate to the primary diabetic physician. A greater understanding is required on how many other factors, 
in particular psychosocial factors, influence the care of the DMO patient.

Diabetic

oedema 
(DMO) 
is 
one 
of 
the 
leading 
causes 
of 
visual 
impairment 
in 
working 
adults.1 
The implications of blinding due to DMO, including the loss of productivity and reduced quality of 
life (QoL), lead to a considerable socioeconomic burden on communities.2–5 Intravitreal treatment 
options, particularly with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents, have shown 
the potential to reduce visual loss far beyond that achieved with laser therapy alone.6–10 Applying 
principles learnt from key clinical trials to the real world setting requires an understanding of the 
many patient-related factors that determine when and how treatment is started and continued. 
 
It is important for clinicians to not only understand such factors but also the evidence base 
for such. 
The aim of this article is to bring clarity to the available data on the key patient-related factors 
that influence the treatment of DMO, by reviewing the literature, forming consensus statements 
and providing recommendations. Discussions are based around the optimum scenario in an ideal 
world where certain barriers were removed, for example, costing, reimbursement and resource 
capacity. Due to the broad nature of this topic and because anti-VEGF therapy is the commonest 
intravitreal intervention for DMO, the scope of the discussion is largely limited to treatment with 
anti-VEGF therapy.
Methods
A panel of 15 retinal experts (see Table 1) met on 14–15 November 2014 in Zurich, Switzerland, 
where the need for clarity of the factors that influence DMO management was initially 
discussed. The panel met again on 10–11 April 2015 in Berlin, Germany, and on 6–7 November 
2015 in Paris, France, to take the work forward. Based on a Delphi-style methodology,11 a range 
of factors in the management of a patient with DMO were identified and the evidence for, and 
relative importance of each, was discussed. A literature search complemented this process. 
PubMed/Medline and EMBASE searches from 1 January 2005 to 22 June 2016 were carried out 
using these factors as exploded mesh terms that occurred in the publication title (i.e. the term 
itself and a series of similar terms and subtopic terms within a particular category as used 
to classify each record by the database providers). Animal studies and non-English language 
papers were excluded. Owing to the paucity of material identified through the searches on

occupation/profession, co-morbidities, compliance and family history, 
it was decided to broaden the searches to papers where the specified 
factor was not used as a major term. After removing duplicates, the 
search results were screened for relevance by a single retinal expert 
(Richard Gale). Recommendations were formed and agreed by the 
panel.
Results
Factors were categorised into three overarching themes: ocular-specific, 
systemic influences and psychosocial factors (see Tables 2 and 3). 
Database searching identified 547 records and a further 140 records 
were provided from expert opinion (687 in total). Removing duplicates 
left 665 results, of which 606 were excluded by expert screening. 
 
In total, therefore, 59 full text articles were accessed and relevant 
articles discussed. 
Ocular-specific factors that influence the 
management of diabetic macular oedema with 
anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy
(Recommendation 1)
Many overlapping definitions of DMO are currently used, for example, 
clinically significant macular oedema (CSMO), centre involving vision 
affecting (CIVA) oedema and focal or diffuse oedema.12,13 Using the 
correct definition is central to aligning treatment with the key clinical trials. 
In 1985, the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) group 
defined CSMO,12 based on clinical examination alone: presence of any 
retinal thickening at or within 500 μm of the foveal centre, lipid exudates at 
or within 500 μm of the foveal centre with adjacent thickening or an area 
of retinal thickening at one or more Macular Photocoagulation Study DA 
(1 disk area ≅ 1.767 mm2) within one disk diameter (1.5 mm) of the foveal 
centre. This definition remains useful in patients undergoing macular 
laser therapy; however, it is not the driver when anti-VEGF therapy is 
used. The inclusion criteria for the majority of the pivotal trials uses a 
form of ‘centre involving, vision affecting’ criteria to initiate treatment. 
Tables 4 and 5 demonstrate that inclusion criteria for the RISE and RIDE, 
Protocol I and T and DA VINCI studies required a combination of vision 
loss and documented retinal thickening.6,7,12 It is worth noting, however, 
the inclusion criteria for the RESTORE study did not require a specific 
CRT measurement but a clinical diagnosis of diffuse or focal thickening.9 
Focal DMO was defined as more than 67% of leakage originated from 
leaking microaneurysms (MAs) in the whole oedema area or 30–67% 
leakage from MAs in the whole oedema area, but >67% of the leakage 
originated from MAs in the central subfield.9 Diffuse DMO was defined 
as <33% of leakage from MAs, the rest from diffuse leaking capillaries 
in the whole oedema area or 30–67% leakage from MAs, but <33% of 
the leakage originated from MAs in the central subfield. This definition 
is somewhat convoluted and is not clinically important as a sub-analysis 
 
of the RESTORE data demonstrated neither group performed better than 
the other.9

A. Ocular-specific
Definition
1
Use of ‘centre involving vision affecting DMO’ is the most useful term in describing DMO to be treated with anti-VEGF therapy and is the primary driver to 
commence therapy
Optical coherence tomography
2
In conjunction with clinical context, OCT is the principal tool used to diagnose DMO. Clinical trial evidence provides support for its use to guide retreatment. 
The central 1 mm2 subfield thickness is the most useful measurement
Fundus fluorescein angiography

While FFA continues to have a role in helping excluded differential diagnosis and documenting macular ischaemia it otherwise has little place in guiding 
commencement of therapy or retreatment
Visual acuity

5
VA is one of the principle factors used to guide commencement and retreatment of therapy, it is a proxy measure of QoL. Caution is required when VA is 
used to guide treatment because of it natural variability in repeat measurements between visits
Patients with unilateral of bilateral DMO should be treated the same although compromise in the treatment regime may have to be made for logistical 
reasons
Co-morbidities
6
The influence of ocular co-morbidities on the potential of therapy to restore vision need to be considered
B. Systemic influences
Glycated haemoglobin
7
HBA1C has no influence on the decision to commence therapy or the decision to retreat. Communication with the physician managing the general diabetes 
is important to optimise control, which in turn optimises the retinopathy in the long term
Blood pressure
8
BP
, unless very high, has little influence on the decision to commence therapy or the decision to retreat. Communication with the physician managing the 
general diabetes is important to optimise control, which in turn optimises the retinopathy in the long term
Lipids
9
Serum lipid status has no influence on the decision to commence therapy or the decision to retreat. Communication with the physician managing the 
general diabetes is important to optimise control, which in turn optimises the retinopathy in the long term
TZDs
10
TZDs should be withdrawn by the prescribing doctor if there is co-existing DMO. It is reasonable to wait a period several weeks to months to see the effect 
of this before commencing therapy.
Body mass index
11
BMI has no influence on whether a patient should be treatment with an anti-VEGF agent. BMI optimisation via the patient’s diabetic physician is 
recommended.
Pregnancy
12
It is imperative that treating physicians routinely ask for and if necessary test for pregnancy as this remains a contraindication for anti-VEGF therapy
Stroke and myocardial infarction
13
Recent stroke or myocardial infarction (<3 months) remains a contraindication for anti-VEGF therapy. Treatment within these time frames requires 
discussion with the patient about the relative risk and benefits of doing so
C. Psychosocial factors
QoL
14
Improving QoL utilities and symptoms of DMO are the ultimate goal in the management of DMO. They are important considerations but may be too crude or 
imprecise to specifically guide treatment
Age
15
In the adult population there is no evidence that age, per se, should influence treatment with anti-VEGF agent
Profession
16
A patient’s profession may influence their visual requirements (QoL influences) and compliance with treatment and so should be discussed
Compliance
17
The importance of compliance should be discussed prior to commencement of therapy. Non-compliant patients have not been specifically studied, 
however, the result of poor attendance is likely to be compromised treatment benefit.

EUROPEAN OPHTHALMIC REVIEW
Diabetic Macular Oedema Patient with Anti-vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Therapy
Optical coherence tomography findings  
(Recommendation 2)
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is the most widely used tool 
to diagnose and manage DMO. The central 1 mm subfield is the most 
useful parameter in determining initiation and retreatment. Patients 
were recruited into the DRCR.net Protocol I who had DMO involving 
the fovea that, amongst other criteria, required a mean OCT central 
subfield thickness on OCT >250 μm on time-domain OCT.14 Inclusion for 
participation in DRCR.net Protocol T included: central subfield thickness 
on OCT ≥250 μm on Zeiss Stratus; ≥320 if male or ≥305 if female on 
Heidelberg Spectralis; ≥305 if male or ≥290 if female on Zeiss Cirrus and 
definite retinal thickening on clinical exam due to DMO involving the 
centre of the macula.6 In the RISE and RIDE trials, eligible participants 
required macular oedema with a central subfield thickness ≥275 
µm on time-domain OCT.15 In the DA VINCI study, clinically significant 
DMO with centre involvement of the fovea was defined as a central 
subfield measurement of ≥250 µm on time-domain OCT.7 Central DMO 
involvement was defined as retinal thickening involving 1 mm central 
(OCT) subfield thickness (CST) in the VISTA and VIVID trials.16
Structural OCT does not provide dynamic information about macular 
perfusion. OCT angiography (OCT-A) is a developing technology and, as 
yet, its role in the routine assessment of the DMO patient is still to be 
fully defined OCT. Used in parallel with spectral domain (SD OCT), OCT-A 
presents the opportunity to learn more about the disease.17,18
Fundus fluorescein angiography findings  
(Recommendation 3)
Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) is no longer commonly used to 
make the diagnosis of DMO. On occasions, FFA is important to differentiate 
DMO from other vascular disorders, such as choroidal neovascularisation, 
retinal vein occlusion or macular teleangectasia. There is little direct 
evidence that FFA has a role in the management of DMO with anti-VEGF 
therapy. The key clinical trials did not specify FFA features as a part of 
inclusion criteria for treatment nor for retreatment (RESTORE, RISE and 
RIDE, Protocol I and T, DA VINCI). FFA is useful in assessing the degree 
of enlargement and irregularity of the foveal avascular zone, i.e. macular 
ischaemia. However, patients with macular ischaemia were studied in a 
subgroup analysis in the RESTORE study and no difference was found 
in their outcome – implying patients with or without macular ischaemia 
should be treated similarly.9 A caveat is that patients were excluded from 
these studies if there was a reason why vision may not improve and so 
patients with very severe macular ischaemia may not have been enrolled.
Visual acuity (Recommendation 4)
Visual acuity (VA) (ETDRS score) is a key factor influencing 
commencement of therapy and retreatment (see Tables 4 and 5). 
Indeed VA assessment was used as an inclusion criteria in RESTORE,9 
DRCR.net Protocols I8 and T,10 DA VINCI7 and VISTA and VIVID studies16 
and furthermore to help guide retreatment (see Tables 4 and 5).8–10,16 
The key clinical trials studying the use of anti-VEGF therapy in DMO only 
included patients with reduced vision so currently there is no evidence 
that supports the benefit of anti-VEGF therapy in those with unaffected, 
very good or very poor VA.
The DRCR.net published findings of a refracted ETDRS coefficient of 
repeatability of 5–13 letters between visits (the worse the VA the higher 
the coefficient). Caution is therefore suggested when change in VA is 
used prospectively as a determination of a true measure of change in 
visual function.
Unilateral or bilateral treatment (Recommendation 5) 
There is no evidence from the pivotal clinical trials that unilateral 
 
or bilateral treatment influences the commencement or retreatment of

patients (RESTORE, RIDE, RISE, Protocol I and T, DA VINCI and VISTA and 
VIVID studies). Similarly, there is no evidence that a better or worse seeing 
eye is treated differently. A compromise in treatment regime may have to 
be made for those receiving bilateral treatment due to logistical reasons.
Ocular co-morbidities (Recommendation 6)
Should a patient have an ocular co-morbidity, physicians need to 
consider the potential to restrict the effect of any treatment or cause 
more profound loss. An example may be co-existing foveal-involving 
atrophy due to age-related macular degeneration. Key studies excluded 
patients with significant co-morbidities from being enrolled into clinical 
trials.8,9,15,19 VA measurements therefore may not reflect change in DMO 
due to co-morbidities. 
Systemic factors that influence the management 
of diabetic macular oedema with anti-vascular 
endothelial growth factor therapy 
Blood Glucose Control (Recommendation 7)
The evidence that management with anti-VEGF therapy for DMO 
should differ based upon their glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) is weak. 
An example of this is a post hoc analysis of the RIDE and RISE trials, 
in which the treatment benefit of ranibizumab for patients with DMO 
seemed independent of baseline HbA1c.20 A retrospective consecutive 
case series of 124 patients with DMO treated with anti-VEGF
, however, 
did find that glucose regulation can impact on the response to anti-VEGF 
therapy.21 Patients with improved glucose control during the study had 
a significantly lower retinal thickness than patients who had a stable or 
worsening HbA1c (mean final CST of 324.3 versus 390.0 μm, respectively; 
p=0.042). Many studies have excluded patients with a very high HbA1c, 
including the RESTORE,9 RISE/RIDE,15 DRCR.net Protocols I8 and T10, the 
DA VINCI7 and VISTA and VIVID studies16 (see Table 4) and so the outcome 
in this group is not as well known.
 
Advising and reinforcing the importance of good glucose control at the 
point of contact during DMO management is good practice for the holistic 
care of patients with diabetes.21–23 Intensive glycaemic control decreases 
the rate of development and progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in 
type 1 and 2 diabetic mellitus patients. In the primary prevention cohort 
of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), there was a 76% 
reduction in the adjusted mean risk for retinopathy development for 
patients who received intensive therapy. In the secondary intervention 
cohort, the progression of retinopathy was reduced by 54%, and the 
development of proliferative or severe non-proliferative retinopathy was 
reduced by 47%.24 The National institute for Health and Excellence (NICE) 
has suggested a target HbA1c for patients with diabetes of 48 mmol/mol 
(6.5%).25,26 It is also good practice to ensure appropriate arrangements 
are in place, with either a diabetologist or primary care physician for 
general diabetic care.
Blood pressure control (Recommendation 8)
There is little evidence that patients should be treated differently based 
upon their starting BP
. The only potential exception is in those with very 
high BP who were excluded from the major clinical trials and therefore 
it is not known if their outcome differs (see Table 4).7–10,15 Likewise, once 
treatment has been commenced there is no evidence, based upon these 
studies, that retreatment should differ depending upon BP
.
However, theoretically, higher BP will be associated with an increase in 
retinal capillary hydrostatic pressure due to the dysfunction of vascular 
autoregulation in the retina of patients with DR. According to Starling’s 
rules this will augment macular oedema, and indeed there is clinical and 
experimental evidence that high BP is an independent direct and short-
term driver of DMO.27–29 
In addition, there is solid evidence to support the benefit of tightly 
controlled blood pressure (BP) on overall retinopathy status. The UKPDS 
investigated the role of tight BP control on various end points, including 
retinopathy and visual loss. In the group with tight BP control, a 35% 
reduction in the progression of retinopathy was observed compared 
with the group assigned to less tight control. At 9-year follow-up, the 
group with tight BP control had a 47% reduction in risk of loss of three 
or more lines of vision (using ETDRS chart).29 Gallego et al. identified that 
an increase of 10 mm/Hg in systolic BP was associated with a 3–20% 
increased risk of retinopathy and an increase of 10 mm/Hg in diastolic BP 
increased risk by 2–30%.30 As such, and based on clinical observations 
and the theoretical issues raised above, it is good practice to ensure BP 
is being addressed by the appropriate care physician and to recommend 
BP control in line with recommendation from organisations such as

NICE and Diabetes UK (BP target: 130/80 mmHg if retinopathy, renal or 
cerebrovascular damage).25 
Serum lipid control (Recommendation 9)
Based upon the pivotal anti-VEGF DMO treatment studies, there is no 
evidence that serum lipid status should alter the way in which anti-VEGF 
therapy is given. Neither inclusion criteria for the commencement of 
therapy or retreatment strategies were guided by serum lipid levels.
Although some study findings suggest that the management of serum 
lipids may reduce retinopathy progression and the need for treatment,31,32 
other clinical data have disputed the association between lipids and the 
severity of DR or DMO. In an ETDRS report, high total cholesterol and 
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels were associated with retinal hard 
exudates.32 The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and the Australian 
Diabetes, Obesity, and Lifestyle Study observed no association between 
serum lipids and DR.33,34 In another study, the level of total cholesterol, 
triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), LDL and very low density 
lipoprotein (VLDL) was not significantly associated with the severity of 
DR or existence of macular oedema.35 Furthermore Chew et al. observed 
that DMO was not significantly associated with high triglyceride levels, 
total cholesterol or LDL levels when lipid profile was stratified.36 
Evidence from the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in 
Diabetes (FIELD) and The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes 
(ACCORD) Eye studies have shown that fenofibrate may influence DR. 
In the FIELD study, fenofibrate (200 mg/day) reduced the need for laser 
therapy and prevented disease progression in patients with pre-existing 
DR.37,38 A systematic review and meta-analysis on dyslipidemia and DMO 
was inconclusive in its findings, indicating that further investigation into 
the relationship between lipid levels and DMO is needed.39
Even if controversy exists about the role of serum lipids for DMO 
specifically, it is important to provide advice on its control for holistic 
patient benefit. The current NICE guidelines for lipid modification 
have recommended that a full lipid profile assessment for people 
with diabetes should include measurement of total cholesterol, HDL 
cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations.40 
Diabetes UK recommends total cholesterol level <4.0 mmol/l, LDL levels 
<2.0 mmol/l, HDL levels ≥1.0 mmol/l in men and ≥1.2 mmol/l in women 
and triglyceride levels ≤1.7 mmol/l.41 
Co-existing thiazolidinedione medication  
(Recommendation 10) 
Peripheral oedema and fluid retention associated with thiazolidinediones 
(TZDs) may increase the risk of DMO,42 however, the exact mechanism 
underlying this risk remains unclear but may be related to an 
independent or secondary effect from related systemic fluid retention, 
possibly by causing increased retinal capillary hydrostatic pressure and 
oedema formation by Starling’s rules. It is advisable to suspend TZD 
administration when macula oedema develops, since this action is likely 
to improve the condition. This should be done as a recommendation 
to the prescribing physician so alternative medication or strategies 
can be sought. It remains an option to observe whether DMO persists 
following suspension of a TZD and whether anti-VEGF therapy need 
 
be commenced.
Body mass index (Recommendation 11)
Some studies have demonstrated a relationship between obesity or 
higher body mass index (BMI) and an increased risk of DR.43–48 Kaštelan 
et al. suggested that BMI, in conjunction with poor glycaemic control, 
hypertension and dyslipidaemia, was associated with DR progression in 
patients with type 2 diabetes.43 Dirani et al. suggested that patients with 
diabetes with higher BMI and larger neck circumference were more likely 
to have DR and more severe stages of DR.45 NICE and the UK National 
Health Service (NHS) Choices guidelines advise that BMI should be 
maintained within the range 18.5 to 24.9 and that BMI values above 25 
increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.49,40 There is, however, no evidence 
available suggesting that, in the context of anti-VEGF therapy, decreasing 
BMI improves response of DMO, or if it has an influence of how treatment 
should be administered.
Pregnancy or potential pregnancy (Recommendation 12)
Current evidence on the use of anti-VEGF therapy in pregnancy cases is very 
clear. Given the potential for teratogenicity, pregnancy is a contraindication 
for anti-VEGF therapy. There have been case reports, however, of unaffected 
babies born to mothers undergoing anti-VEGF therapy.51–54 Clear advice 
needs to be given on pregnancy prevention during anti-VEGF therapy or 
for 3 months thereafter. In addition, consideration needs to be given as to 
the appropriateness of within clinic pregnancy testing.
Stroke and myocardial infarction (Recommendation 13)
There continues to be discussion in the literature about the potential 
signal of increased risk of cerebrovascular or cardiovascular events with 
the use of anti-VEGF therapy. Studies do not enrol patients if these events 
have occurred recently (<3 months). The risk of recurrence of stroke and 
myocardial infarction when they have recently occurred (<3 months) in 
the context of anti-VEGF therapy has not been specifically studied and so 
careful discussion with the patient about the potential risk and benefits 
of such treatment is required in this circumstance.7,9,10,15,55 
Psychosocial factors that influence the management 
of diabetic macular oedema with anti-vascular 
endothelial growth factor therapy
There is little good quality evidence that psychosocial factors influence 
the use of anti-VEGF therapy in the management of DMO; therefore, the 
statements in this section are based on opinion.
Quality of life and patient-reported symptoms 
(Recommendation 14)
QoL utilities and patient-reported symptoms were not used as selection 
or retreatment criteria in the RESTORE,9 RISE/RIDE,15 DRCR.net Protocols 
I14 and T10 or VISTA and VIVID studies.16
Age (Recommendation 15)
There is no high-level evidence supporting any association between the 
influence of adult age on the response to anti-VEGF therapy or alteration 
in how treatment should be administered. It is noteworthy that the 
 
age limitation in the key studies was ≥18 years, without an upper limit 
(see Table 4).9,10,15,19,55 
Profession (Recommendation 16)
There are data demonstrating that a patient’s working profession is 
restricted and their employment is made more expensive due to visual 
impairment by DR.2,56–58 There are, however, no data to suggest that a 
patients’ profession has any influence on DMO diagnosis or management. 
Compliance (Recommendation 17)
Anti-VEGF therapy in non-compliance patients was not studied in any of 
the work identified by the literature search. Furthermore, trial participants 
are not usually included in key clinical trials if the recruiting physicians 
feel that they will not be compliant with study visits.

People with both vision-threatening DR and psychosocial problems 
may have significantly reduced levels of functioning compared with 
psychologically healthy counterparts.59 This may have a negative impact 
on compliance, diabetes control and subsequent outcome. Pivotal 
studies have not specifically studied this group. 
Conclusions
The evidence for the major drivers influencing the management of 
DMO with anti-VEGF therapy are undoubtedly ocular specific: VA 
and OCT findings. The panel discussed how patients may decide 
not to commence therapy though, even in the presence of reduced 
acuity and a thickened OCT macular scan. This is not an uncommon 
scenario particularly if a patient was asymptomatic or does not 
consider the symptoms to be sufficiently troublesome. The evidence 
for not commencing therapy, or indeed deferring therapy with or 
without macular laser for a significant period of time (74 weeks or 
more), demonstrates that VA outcomes are inferior compared with 
those commencing therapy early.60 
Although there is little direct evidence that control of systemic factors 
such as HBA1c, BP and dyslipidemia influence how therapy should be 
given, there are signals that in the short- and long-term (HBA1c and 
dyslipidemia) controlling these factors can help with the control of 
DMO and DR. It is important, not only from this point of view, but also 
for the holistic care of patients to recommend optimal systemic risk 
factor control. This should be achieved through communication with the 
physician in charge of the blood glucose management whether they are 
a primary care physician or diabetologist.
Psychosocial factors are important in influencing how patients 
 
are managed. Ultimately it is symptoms and QoL that physicians are 
trying to improve and indeed often are guided by these to influence 
commencement of treatment. As symptoms and QoL utilities can be 
either imprecise or relatively crude measures, they are not used as 
primary treatment endpoints in clinical trials and so no evidence exists 
to support their use as specific treatment endpoints. Visual function 
QoL has been shown to improve in key studies though, although 
EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D) did not improve in the 
RESTORE study. The means by which psychosocial factors influence 
how patients are managed is so far poorly studied.
There are a number of potential factors that influence the way in which 
the DMO patient is managed, but many lack a firm evidence base. This 
lack of evidence raises the risk that treatment decisions may be partly 
based on assumptions. Better and more extensive evidence to support 
DMO treatment remains an unmet need. Physicians treating DMO 
are therefore pointed towards a list of key ocular-specific, systemic 
and psychosocial considerations that are vital in deciding when to 
commence or retreat a patient with DMO (see Table 2) and these may 
help improve outcomes. q
