BACKGROUND
Levosimendan is a calcium-sensitizing drug with inotropic and other properties 
that may improve outcomes in patients with sepsis.
METHODS
We conducted a double-blind, randomized clinical trial to investigate whether le-
vosimendan reduces the severity of organ dysfunction in adults with sepsis. Patients 
were randomly assigned to receive a blinded infusion of levosimendan (at a dose of 
0.05 to 0.2 μg per kilogram of body weight per minute) for 24 hours or placebo 
in addition to standard care. The primary outcome was the mean daily Sequential 
Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score in the intensive care unit up to day 28 (scores 
for each of five systems range from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating more severe 
dysfunction; maximum score, 20). Secondary outcomes included 28-day mortality, 
time to weaning from mechanical ventilation, and adverse events.
RESULTS
The trial recruited 516 patients; 259 were assigned to receive levosimendan and 
257 to receive placebo. There was no significant difference in the mean (±SD) SOFA 
score between the levosimendan group and the placebo group (6.68±3.96 vs. 
6.06±3.89; mean difference, 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], −0.07 to 1.29; 
P 
= 
0.053). Mortality at 28 days was 34.5% in the levosimendan group and 30.9% 
in the placebo group (absolute difference, 3.6 percentage points; 95% CI, −4.5 to 
11.7; P 
= 
0.43). Among patients requiring ventilation at baseline, those in the levo-
simendan group were less likely than those in the placebo group to be success-
fully weaned from mechanical ventilation over the period of 28 days (hazard ratio, 
0.77; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.97; P 
= 
0.03). More patients in the levosimendan group than 
in the placebo group had supraventricular tachyarrhythmia (3.1% vs. 0.4%; abso-
lute difference, 2.7 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.1 to 5.3; P 
= 
0.04).
CONCLUSIONS
The addition of levosimendan to standard treatment in adults with sepsis was not 
associated with less severe organ dysfunction or lower mortality. Levosimendan was 
associated with a lower likelihood of successful weaning from mechanical ventila-
tion and a higher risk of supraventricular tachyarrhythmia. (Funded by the NIHR 
Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation Programme and others; LeoPARDS Current 
Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN12776039.)

S
epsis is defined as life-threatening 
organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated 
host response to infection1 and is a leading 
cause of death worldwide. Septic shock is the 
most severe form of the condition and results in 
circulatory and metabolic abnormalities.2 Per-
sisting hypotension despite adequate fluid resus-
citation is due to a combination of profound 
vasodilatation, vascular hyporeactivity to cate-
cholamines, and myocardial depression.3 Al-
though catecholamines are the recommended 
first-line therapy for septic shock,4 high doses of 
administered catecholamines and high levels of 
circulating catecholamines are associated with 
poor outcomes and severe side effects, including 
myocardial injury and peripheral ischemia.5-7
Levosimendan is a calcium-sensitizing drug 
with inotropic and vasodilator properties that is 
licensed in numerous countries (not including 
the United States) to treat decompensated heart 
failure.8 In contrast to catecholamines, levosi-
mendan causes increased myocardial contraction 
with a minimal increase in oxygen demand,9 and 
diastolic relaxation is not impaired. Small stud-
ies that have investigated the use of levosimen-
dan in patients with septic shock have shown 
improvements in hemodynamic variables,10 mi-
crocirculatory flow,11 and renal10 and hepatic12 
function, as compared with dobutamine. Other 
important noninotropic effects have also been 
shown, including antiinflammatory,13 antioxida-
tive,14 and antiapoptotic15 effects and possibly 
protection from ischemia and reperfusion inju-
ry.16 A recent meta-analysis supported the use of 
levosimendan in patients with sepsis, but only 
125 patients in total had been treated.17 The 
Levosimendan for the Prevention of Acute Organ 
Dysfunction in Sepsis (LeoPARDS) trial was de-
signed to test whether the addition of levosimen-
dan to standard care would reduce the severity 
of organ dysfunction among patients with septic 
shock and to assess its safety profile in patients 
with this condition.
Methods
Trial Design and Participants
We conducted this multicenter, randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 
34 general adult intensive care units (ICUs) in 
the United Kingdom. The trial protocol, available 
with the full text of this article at NEJM.org, was 
designed by the trial management committee and 
has been published previously.18 The London–Har-
row Research and Ethics Committee approved the 
protocol.
The trial was funded by the National Institute 
for Health Research and Tenax Therapeutics and 
sponsored by Imperial College London. Data man-
agement and analysis were performed by the 
Imperial Clinical Trials Unit. Orion Pharma pro-
vided levosimendan and placebo free of charge. 
The funders, the sponsor, and Orion Pharma had 
no role in designing the trial, gathering or ana-
lyzing the data, writing the manuscript, or mak-
ing the decision to submit the manuscript for 
publication. The first author vouches for the data 
and analyses, as well as for the fidelity of this 
report to the trial protocol.
Enrollment Criteria and Randomization
Adult patients who had septic shock and had 
received vasopressors for at least 4 hours were 
eligible for inclusion. Detailed inclusion and ex-
clusion criteria are provided in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix, available at NEJM.org. Patients 
had to be recruited within 24 hours after meeting 
the inclusion criteria. Written informed consent 
was obtained from either the patient or, in the 
event that the patient lacked capacity, a personal 
or professional legal representative before en-
rollment in the trial. Retrospective written in-
formed consent was sought from the patient once 
capacity was regained.
Enrollment, randomization, and data collec-
tion were performed by means of an online sys-
tem (InForm, Oracle). Patients were assigned in 
a 1:1 ratio to receive levosimendan or placebo, 
with the use of variable block sizes of four and 
six and computer-generated random numbers and 
with stratification according to recruitment cen-
ter. The randomization sequence was prepared 
by an independent statistician. Trial-specific la-
beling and packaging, to ensure that trial packs 
were identical, was undertaken by Victoria Phar-
maceuticals. Patients and clinical and research 
staff remained unaware of the trial-group as-
signment throughout the trial.
Clinical Treatment
Patients were assigned to receive a blinded infu-
sion of either levosimendan or placebo for 24 
hours in addition to standard care. Figure S1 in 
the Supplementary Appendix shows the infusion

algorithm. No bolus loading dose was given. The 
administration of levosimendan or placebo was 
started at a rate of 0.1 μg per kilogram of body 
weight per minute and, in the absence of rate-
limiting side effects, was increased after 2 to 4 
hours to 0.2 μg per kilogram per minute for a 
further 20 to 22 hours. Patients received intrave-
nous fluid boluses for any clinically significant 
drop in blood pressure and, if necessary, vaso-
pressors were adjusted to maintain an adequate 
blood pressure. If the patient had rate-limiting 
side effects — either hypotension or severe tachy-
cardia (heart rate >130 beats per minute, or an 
increase of >20% if the heart rate was already 
>110 beats per minute) — at the dose of 0.2 μg 
per kilogram per minute, then the infusion rate 
was reduced to 0.1 μg per kilogram per minute. 
If necessary to avoid hypotension or severe tachy-
cardia, the rate was reduced to 0.05 μg per kilo-
gram per minute or even discontinued.
Other aspects of clinical care were at the dis-
cretion of the local physician and were based on 
the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines (see 
the Supplementary Appendix).4 The trial protocol 
recommended a mean arterial pressure of 65 to 
70 mm Hg. This pressure could be varied for in-
dividual patients, but investigators were encour-
aged to use the lowest dose of vasopressor that 
maintained tissue perfusion in each patient. Ad-
ditional inotropic agents could be used as clini-
cally indicated (i.e., for ongoing low cardiac out-
put after fluid resuscitation). Dobutamine was the 
recommended inotrope, with lowering of the dose 
and discontinuation once adequate oxygen delivery 
had been achieved.
Outcome Measures
The primary trial outcome was the mean daily 
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) 
score19 while the patient was in the ICU, as mea-
sured from randomization to a maximum of 28 
days. The daily SOFA score after baseline was 
calculated for each patient on the basis of five 
organ systems: cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, 
hepatic, and coagulation systems. (Scores for 
each system range from 0 to 4, with higher scores 
indicating more severe organ-system dysfunction; 
maximum score, 20.) The neurologic system was 
not included, as in some previous trials,20,21 owing 
to the difficulties of accurately scoring the Glasgow 
Coma Score daily in the presence of sedation. 
Daily scores were totaled for each patient’s ICU 
stay and divided by the number of days that they 
remained in the ICU in order to calculate the 
mean SOFA score for that patient.
To assess the effect of levosimendan on indi-
vidual organ systems, the individual SOFA com-
ponents were analyzed, and several other clinical 
outcomes were determined a priori for secondary 
analyses. These outcomes included the number 
of catecholamine-free and ventilator-free days, 
the time to weaning from mechanical ventilation, 
the proportion of patients with a major acute 
kidney event22 over a period of 28 days (defined 
as death, new requirement for renal-replacement 
therapy, or sustained renal failure [stage 2 or 3 
acute kidney injury23] at day 28), and the duration 
of renal-replacement therapy. Mortality rates at 
28 days, at ICU discharge, and at hospital dis-
charge, as well as the length of stay in the ICU 
and serious adverse events, were also recorded.
Statistical Analysis
We calculated that a sample of 500 patients 
would provide the trial with 90% power to detect 
a difference of 0.5 points in the mean SOFA score, 
assuming a standard deviation of 1.5 and a sig-
nificance level of 0.05.19 To allow for a 3% rate 
of withdrawal of consent, the recruitment target 
was 516 patients.
The primary analysis was unadjusted in the 
intention-to-treat population, and reported the 
difference in mean SOFA scores between the two 
trial groups. Because the mean SOFA score was 
not normally distributed, 95% confidence inter-
vals of the mean difference were calculated with 
the use of bootstrapping, with the application of 
the percentile method with 100,000 samples. We 
used a priori defined regression models to inves-
tigate whether the main analysis was sensitive to 
adjustment for trial-center (i.e., ICU) effects, 
age, and severity of illness (according to the 
Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation 
[APACHE] II score) with bootstrapped confi-
dence intervals.
Because levosimendan is an inotrope with 
prolonged hemodynamic effects but is not in-
cluded as part of the cardiovascular scoring 
within the SOFA score, the primary analysis was 
repeated with the exclusion of the cardiovascular 
component as a sensitivity analysis. We prespeci-
fied the use of Bayesian models of multiple im-
putation for missing data, as described in the 
Supplementary Appendix; we also performed

post hoc analyses using imputation to account 
for any differential effect of treatment on the 
rates of ICU discharge or death before 28 days. 
Time-to-event data were described with the use 
of Kaplan–Meier plots and Cox regression, with 
adjustment for age and APACHE II score, allow-
ing for clustering according to ICU.
Four subgroup analyses were planned a priori 
on the basis of the baseline measurement of the 
cardiac index, if measured (lowest third vs. mid-
dle and highest thirds), the central venous oxy-
gen saturation (low [<70%], normal [70 to 85%], 
or high [>85%]), the serum lactate level (≤2 mmol 
per liter vs. >2 mmol per liter), and the dose of 
norepinephrine (below vs. above the median in-
fusion rate). The heterogeneity of treatment ef-
fect according to subgroup was calculated with 
the use of a permutation test, which permuted 
both the subgroup and the trial-group assign-
ment.24 All the analyses were performed with the 
use of R software, version 3.2.2 (R Project for 
Statistical Computing).25 A P value of less than 
0.05 was considered to indicate statistical signifi-
cance, with the use of two-sided tests; no correc-
tions were made for multiple testing.
Results
Trial Participants
The trial ran from January 2014 through Decem-
ber 2015, when the required sample of 516 pa-
tients were enrolled. Figure 1 shows the ran-
domization and flow of patients in the trial; 259 
patients were assigned to receive levosimendan 
and 257 to receive placebo. A total of 8 patients 
(4 patients in each group) did not receive the as-
signed trial regimen. The family of 1 patient in 
the levosimendan group withdrew consent after 
randomization but before the drug was admin-
istered. This patient was excluded from all the 
analyses. The other 7 patients were included in 
the intention-to-treat analysis.
The two groups were well balanced at base-
line (Tables 1 and 2, and Tables S1 and S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The median time to 
recruitment was 16 hours after the initiation of 
vasopressors, and the median dose of norepi-
nephrine was 0.28 μg per kilogram per minute 
at the time of starting the infusion.
Cardiovascular Effects
The infusion was discontinued before the 24-hour 
time point owing to hemodynamic instability 
(hypotension or tachycardia) in 33 of 244 patients 
(13.5%) in the levosimendan group, as compared 
with 19 of 248 patients (7.7%) in the placebo 
group. The mean arterial pressure was lower in 
the patients in the levosimendan group than in 
those in the placebo group in the first 24 hours 
(the duration of the infusion) but was similar 
thereafter in the two groups. The rate and dura-
tion of the norepinephrine infusion were higher 
in the levosimendan group than in the placebo 
group; there was also less frequent use of dobu-
tamine in the levosimendan group. The heart rate 
over the first 4 days was significantly higher in 
patients in the levosimendan group than in those 
in the placebo group. Intravenous-fluid adminis-
tration, fluid balance, and serum lactate levels 
were similar in the two groups. Details are pro-
vided in Table S3 and Figures S2 through S6 in 
the Supplementary Appendix.
Outcomes
The percentage of daily SOFA scores that were 
missing ranged from 2.3% for the cardiovascular 
component to 12.8% for the liver component. The 
primary outcome, the mean (±SD) SOFA score over 
the stay in the ICU, was 6.68±3.96 in the levosi-
mendan group and 6.06±3.89 in the placebo group 
(mean difference, 0.61; 95% confidence interval 
[CI], −0.07 to 1.29; P 
= 
0.053) (Table 3). After 
adjustment for ICU, age, and APACHE II score in 
a regression model, the mean difference in the 
score was 0.59 (95% CI, −0.02 to 1.20; P 
= 
0.06). 
In an analysis that considered each component 
of the total SOFA score independently, the mean 
daily cardiovascular score was higher in the le-
vosimendan group than in the placebo group 
(mean difference, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.46; 
P 
= 
0.01). The prespecified and post hoc sensitiv-
ity analyses did not materially change the result 
(Table 3, and Table S4 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). The total daily SOFA scores and indi-
vidual component scores are shown in Figures 
S7 through S12 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Secondary outcomes are shown in Table 3. 
Mortality at 28 days was 34.5% in the levosimen-
dan group and 30.9% in the placebo group (mean 
difference, 3.6 percentage points; 95% CI, −4.5 to 
11.7; P 
= 
0.43). The Kaplan–Meier curves for sur-
vival to day 28 are shown in Figure 2. Among 
patients requiring mechanical ventilation at 
baseline, those in the levosimendan group were 
less likely than those in the placebo group to be 
successfully weaned from mechanical ventila-

0.77; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.97; P 
= 
0.03) (Fig. S13 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). The number of 
catecholamine-free days was 22 days in the levo-
simendan group and 23 in the placebo group 
(difference, −1.0 day; 95% CI, −4.5 to 1.0; P 
= 
0.09). 
A total of 32 patients in the levosimendan group 
had a serious adverse event, as compared with 
23 in the placebo group. Supraventricular tachy-
arrhythmia was significantly more common in 
the levosimendan group than in the placebo 
group. There were no significant differences 
over time between the two groups in the cardiac 
index, stroke volume, central venous oxygen 
saturations or pressure, the ratio of the partial 
pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of 
inspired oxygen, and the serum creatinine and 
bilirubin levels (Figs. S14 through S20 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
There were no significant between-group dif-
ferences in the mean SOFA score or in 28-day 
mortality in the prespecified subgroups. There 
was no significant heterogeneity of treatment 
effect in any of the subgroup analyses (Fig. S21 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
Discussion
In this trial, the addition of levosimendan to 
standard care was not associated with less se-
vere organ dysfunction in adult patients with 
septic shock. Patients who were treated with le-
vosimendan required more norepinephrine, had 
higher heart rates, had a higher rate of arrhyth-
mia, and underwent mechanical ventilation for 
longer than those who received placebo.
Levosimendan is an inotropic agent with a 
mechanism of action that differs from that of 
catecholamines. By sensitizing cardiomyocytes 
to existing levels of intracellular calcium, an 
increase in the force of myocardial contraction 
is achieved with a minimal increase in myocar-
dial oxygen demand, in contrast to catechol-
amines.9 As calcium levels fall in diastole, relax-
ation of the myocardium is not impaired with 
levosimendan, which may be an additional ben-
efit over catecholamines.26 Although levosimen-
dan has a half-life of approximately 1 hour, its 
active metabolite OR-1896 has a half-life of 80 
hours. Therefore, a single 24-hour infusion 
should provide hemodynamic effects over the 
course of a week,27 which is long enough to sup-
port the majority of patients with septic shock 
until hemodynamic recovery.20
Preclinical and small clinical trials have 
shown a potential benefit of levosimendan on 
renal,10 hepatic,12 and pulmonary28 function in 
patients with sepsis. Therefore, the mean daily 
SOFA score was chosen as the primary outcome 
in this trial to fully assess the clinical efficacy 
and biologic effect of levosimendan. However, 
there was no evidence of any beneficial effect on 
the total SOFA score or on any individual com-
ponent of the score or on any other clinical 
outcome. The cardiovascular SOFA score was 
higher in the levosimendan group than in the 
placebo group, which reflects the higher doses 
of norepinephrine that were required to main-
tain the mean arterial pressure.
Mortality in our trial population was lower 
than in previous studies of levosimendan in pa-
tients with septic shock. This difference is, at 
least in part, a consequence of the fact that we 
recruited a wide range of patients with sepsis, 
without requiring a low cardiac output as an 
enrollment criterion. Myocardial dysfunction, 
although present in more than 50% of patients 
with septic shock,3 may not always be clinically 
evident, even when cardiac-output monitoring is 
used.29 There were four planned subgroup analy-
ses to examine the effect of levosimendan in 
high-risk patients, including those with a low 
cardiac output, those with impaired oxygen de-
livery to the tissues, and those receiving high-
dose catecholamines. There was no evidence of 
a beneficial effect of levosimendan in any of 
these prespecified subgroups.
Although levosimendan does not stimulate 
β-adrenoreceptors, a significantly higher heart 
rate was seen in the levosimendan group than in 
the placebo group, most likely owing to vasodi-
latation but possibly related to the higher rate of 
infusion (i.e., higher dose) of norepinephrine in 
the levosimendan group.30 Similarly, there was a 
higher rate of tachyarrhythmia among patients 
in the levosimendan group than among those in 
the placebo group. These observations may have 
contributed to the lack of overall clinical benefit 
and are consistent with recent data that suggest 
a potential benefit in treating persistent tachy-
cardia in patients with sepsis with the use of 
beta-blockers.31 It is also possible that the higher 
rate of norepinephrine use in the levosimendan 
group than in the placebo group may have con-

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
tributed to further catecholamine-induced myo-
cardial dysfunction.
This trial has several limitations. We investi-
gated levosimendan as added to standard care 
rather than a comparison of levosimendan with 
an alternative inotrope, such as dobutamine. 
Less than 10% of the patients in the placebo 
group received dobutamine, although the rate of 
use in the placebo group was higher than in the 
levosimendan group and may explain in part 
why the cardiac index and stroke volume were 
not higher in the levosimendan group than in 
the placebo group. There was no significant dif-
ference in outcome seen in the prespecified 
subgroup analysis involving patients with a low 
cardiac index; however, the number of patients 
with a measured low cardiac index was small 
(52 patients). Similarly, no echocardiographic 
analyses were performed to provide additional de-
tailed information about changes in myocardial 
function with levosimendan treatment. Therefore, 
this trial cannot provide guidance as to which 
inotrope is best to use in the management of 
sepsis if a low cardiac index is present. The tar-
get mean arterial pressure of 65 to 70 mm Hg, 
which was recommended in the protocol and re-
iterated at investigator meetings, was frequently 
exceeded (as in other trials involving patients 
with shock20,32,33), which suggests that the nor-
epinephrine doses that were administered could 
have been reduced in the two trial groups.
In conclusion, in adult patients with septic 
shock, the addition of levosimendan to standard 
care was not associated with less severe organ 
dysfunction or lower mortality. Patients who were 
assigned to receive levosimendan required more 
norepinephrine, were less likely to be successfully 
weaned from mechanical ventilation, and had 
more tachycardia and a higher rate of supraven-
tricular arrhythmia than those assigned to receive 
placebo.
