Abstract
Objective
A paucity of corroborative psychological and psychiatric evidence may be inhibiting detec-
tion of drug intoxication suicides in the United States. We evaluated the relative importance
of suicide notes and psychiatric history in the classification of suicide by drug intoxication
versus firearm (gunshot wound) plus hanging/suffocation—the other two major, but overtly
violent methods.
Methods
This observational multilevel (individual/county), multivariable study employed a general-
ized linear mixed model (GLMM) to analyze pooled suicides and undetermined intent
deaths, as possible suicides, among the population aged 15 years and older in the 17 states
participating in the National Violent Death Reporting System throughout 2011–2013. The

 outcome measure was relative odds of suicide versus undetermined classification, adjusted
for demographics, precipitating circumstances, and investigation characteristics.
Results
A suicide note, prior suicide attempt, or affective disorder was documented in less than one-
third of suicides and one-quarter of undetermined deaths. The prevalence gaps were larger
among drug intoxication cases than gunshot/hanging cases. The latter were more likely
than intoxication cases to be classified as suicide versus undetermined manner of death
(adjusted odds ratio [OR], 41.14; 95% CI, 34.43–49.15), as were cases documenting a sui-
cide note (OR, 33.90; 95% CI, 26.11–44.05), prior suicide attempt (OR, 2.42; 95% CI, 2.11–
2.77), or depression (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.38 to 1.88), or bipolar disorder (OR, 1.41; 95% CI,
1.10–1.81). Stratification by mechanism/cause intensified the association between a note
and suicide classification for intoxication cases (OR, 45.43; 95% CI, 31.06–66.58). Prior sui-
cide attempt (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 2.19–3.18) and depression (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.17–1.87)
were associated with suicide classification in intoxication but not gunshot/hanging cases.
Conclusions
Without psychological/psychiatric evidence contributing to manner of death classification,
suicide by drug intoxication in the US is likely profoundly under-reported. Findings harbor
adverse implications for surveillance, etiologic understanding, and prevention of suicides
and drug deaths.
Introduction
Following a 19% decline between 1986 and the turn of the century, the United States (US) sui-
cide rate rose from 10.40 per 100,000 population in 2000 to 13.75 in 2015—a 32% increase [1].
Although large, this rise may be a serious underestimate due to increasing misclassification of
intoxication suicides [2], a trend detected in other countries [3,4]. The US drug intoxication
mortality rate for persons 15 years and older has risen by 257%—from 7.81 deaths per 100,000
in 2000 to 20.07 in 2015 [1]. This increase primarily implicates the component involving phar-
maceutical opioids, heroin, and other illicit opioids [5,6]. Distinguishing manner of death
showed that 67% of drug fatalities in the 15 and older population in 2000 were classified as
accident, followed by suicide, undetermined intent (hereafter “undetermined”), and homicide
at 19%, 14%, and 0.1% [1]. By 2015, accidents constituted 84% of these deaths versus 10% for
suicide, 6% for undetermined, and 0.1% for homicide. At 322%, the 15-year rise in the accident
component of the drug intoxication death rate was 9-fold higher than the corresponding rise
in the drug intoxication suicide rate. Viewed in the context of under-resourced and overbur-
dened emergency healthcare [7,8] and medicolegal death investigation systems [9,10], these
differentials and discrepancies buttress a scenario of growing suicide misclassification. Com-
pounding the situation, medical examiners and coroners need substantial affirmative evidence
to assign suicide or homicide as the manner of death, whereas information can be scant for
supporting an accident option, their major default [11].
Suicide is a highly stigmatized and perpetually undercounted phenomenon in the US [12].
Firearm (gunshot wound), hanging/suffocation, and drug intoxication are the leading meth-
ods, accounting for 88.3% of suicides in 2015 [1], with respective components of 49.8%, 26.8%,
and 11.7%. However, strong corroborative psychological and psychiatric evidence, in the form

 of a suicide note and psychiatric history, may be much more important to ascertainment of
suicide by drug intoxication than by the other two overtly violent methods [13–15].
A meta-analysis of 27 psychological autopsy studies [16] and a systematic review of 22 case-
control studies and 54 case series [17] indicated that up to 90% of suicides in the US and other
Western countries had a diagnosable psychiatric disorder at time of death. An American mul-
tiple-cause-of-death study showed that, whereas diagnosed psychiatric disorders distinguished
suicides from deaths whose manner was classified as accident, they were documented in less
than 10% of the death certificates for the suicides [18]. A subsequent American multiple-
cause-of-death study of pooled suicides and undetermined deaths found that cases without
psychiatric documentation manifested a 260% excess likelihood of an undetermined classifica-
tion [19]. An English coroner study reported a large prevalence gap in suicide notes [20], as
potentially pivotal evidence [21,22], between suicide and undetermined cases—50% versus
11%. Undetermined is universally regarded as the manner of death category most susceptible
to suicide misclassification [23–27], and drug intoxication and other poisoning is the predomi-
nant injury cause/mechanism represented among undetermined cases in the US [19, 28]. In
the United Kingdom, suicide rates are officially presented as a composite of rates for registered
suicides and undetermined deaths [29], an accommodation that increases the suicide rate by
approximately 20% [30].
In this multilevel (individual/county), multivariable study of the association between psy-
chological/psychiatric documentation and suicide versus undetermined manner of death clas-
sification, based on microdata from the US National Violent Death Reporting System
(NVDRS), we first calculated the prevalence of a documented affective disorder, suicide note,
and past suicide attempt among suicide and undetermined cases. We then evaluated associa-
tions between these variables and suicide versus undetermined classification, and whether
emergent associations were more paramount among drug intoxication cases than gunshot and
hanging/suffocation cases. Our incorporation of undetermined deaths, as well as registered
suicides, not only provided a window on the nature of suicide misclassification within the
undetermined manner of death category [15], but within the accident category—as a much
larger reservoir for obscuring drug intoxication suicides [31,32].
Materials and methods
National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) Restricted Access
Database
The principal data source for this study was the Restricted Access Database in the NVDRS, a
state, territory, and incident-based surveillance system that employs public health informatics
for making data linkages to produce detailed, individual-level information about suicide and
other violent deaths [33]. Administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), the NVDRS primarily comprises data from death certificates, law enforcement rec-
ords, and medical examiner and coroner records. This system variably includes such optional
supplementary data as crime laboratory reports and hospital records. Its Restricted Access
Database contains de-identified information that includes geographic location, circumstances,
and personal sociodemographic characteristics. In this study, the microdata pertained to the
17 states, disaggregatable to county of death, which participated in the NVDRS throughout
our observation period, 2011–2013. These states were Alaska, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky,
Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Ore-
gon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin. Our study population
comprised deaths from intentional self-harm, that is, registered suicides (ICD-10: U03,
X60-X84, Y87.0), and undetermined deaths (ICD-10 Y10-Y34 and Y87.2, Y89.9) whose state

 and county of death were known. It was further limited to decedents aged 15 years and older,
since less than 1% of known suicides nationally were younger [1]. Decedents in the study pop-
ulation totaled 40,581.
Table 1 provides comparative population and mortality data for the 17 NVDRS states in
this study and for the entire US in 2012, the mid-year in our observation period. With a popu-
lation approaching one-third of that of the US, these states closely resembled the nation in
their age and sex composition, manner of death distribution, and crude and age-adjusted all-
cause, suicide, and undetermined mortality rates. This demographic concordance supports the
generalizability of our results, although NVDRS states overrepresented non-Hispanic Whites
and Blacks and underrepresented Hispanics. Natural causes or diseases accounted for the over-
whelming preponderance of deaths in both the NVDRS states and nationally. However, the

 disproportionate toll that suicide and other injury exact in premature mortality and truncated
life expectancy [34–36] is masked in the equating of individual deaths in most conventional
summary mortality measures.
Individual-level variables from NVDRS
Manner of death (suicide versus undetermined) was the outcome variable. Individual-level
predictors were overtness of selected injury mechanisms/causes (gunshot and hanging/ suffo-
cation versus drug intoxication); suicide note (yes versus no or unknown); prior suicide
attempt (yes versus no or unknown); and primary mental diagnosis (depression or bipolar dis-
order versus none or unknown). Other individual-level covariates were autopsy status; current
mental health treatment; crisis in past two weeks; number of intimate partner or legal or job or
financial or school problems; blood alcohol concentration (grams per deciliter); number of
other specified drug positives; physical health problem; age; sex; race/ethnicity; marital status;
and education.
County-level covariates and data sources
Linked to the microdata, there were two county-level medicolegal covariates: selection mode
(elected or appointed) of the chief medical examiner or coroner and accreditation status/type
of medicolegal death investigation system (accredited medical examiner, accredited coroner,
unaccredited medical examiner, unaccredited coroner). The data source for selection mode
was a CDC website [37], and those for the investigation systems were the respective websites
of the two relevant accrediting agencies, the National Association of Medical Examiners [38]
and the International Association of Coroners & Medical Examiners [39], and email or tele-
phone communication with state, district, or county offices to resolve outstanding questions.
A third county-level covariate was urbanicity, a surrogate for external forces that may support
or inhibit medicolegal death investigations [40]. Operationalized across five categories (large
metropolitan, small metropolitan, adjacent metropolitan, micropolitan or adjacent, rural) rep-
resenting the 12 ordinal categories of the 2013 Urban Influence Codes, its data source was the
County Area Health Resource File for 2014–2015 [41].
Statistical analysis and hypotheses
Pursuant to profiling suicides and undetermined cases, we used a generalized linear mixed
model (GLMM) to test the respective hypotheses that: among the pooled cases, the designation
of a “suicide” manner of death would be more likely when (1) the injury mechanism/cause was
gunshot or hanging/suffocation (as more overtly violent methods of suicide), versus drug
intoxication; and there was documentation of (2) a suicide note, (3) a prior suicide attempt, or
(4) a primary diagnosis of depression or bipolar disorder. Then we tested our final hypothesis
that any observed associations, pertaining to hypotheses 2 through 4, were stronger among
drug intoxication than gunshot/hanging cases. GLMM is a two-level model, which was logistic
at the individual level and linear at the county level. We included a state-level random effect to
incorporate the data structure of counties nested in a state and individuals nested in a county.
The statistical software was SAS for Windows, version 9.4 (Cary, NC: SAS Institute Inc., 2002–
2010).
Results
There were 36,190 suicides and 4,391 undetermined deaths in the 17 NVDRS states between
2011 and 2013 (Table 2). Thirty-one percent of the suicides were accompanied by a suicide

 note, compared with 1.5% for the undetermined cases. Prevalence of documented suicide
attempts was 18% among suicides and 1.5% among the undetermineds, with corresponding
prevalences of comorbid depression and bipolar disorder of 28%, 23%, 4%, and 5%. Gunshot/
hangings constituted 68% of the suicides, compared with 11% for the drug intoxication cases,
whereas the latter constituted 55% of the undetermined cases versus 4% of the gunshot/
hangings.
The multilevel, multivariable analysis showed that gunshot/hanging deaths were 41 times
more likely than drug intoxication deaths to be classified by medical examiners and coroners
as suicides (Table 3)—affirming the hypothesized association regarding overtness of injury
mechanism/cause. Odds also were higher for the residual specified group, whose injury

 mechanisms included gassing, other poisoning, cutting, jumping (falling), and drowning
(immersion). Consistent with our second hypothesis, cases with a note were 34 times more
likely than cases with no note or unknown note status to be classified as suicide. Also affirmed
were our third and fourth hypotheses, which concerned evidence of a prior suicide attempt or
a primary diagnosis of depression or bipolar disorder, respectively. Decedents who had a prior
suicide attempt were 2.4 times more likely than decedents without such history to be classified
as suicide, and those with documented unipolar depression or bipolar disorder were respec-
tively 61% and 41% more likely than their referent to be so classified.
Stratification by mechanism/cause
Focus on a comparison of drug intoxication and gunshot/hanging suicides revealed marked
differentials in their respective prevalences of a documented suicide note, prior suicide
attempt, and a primary diagnosis of depression and bipolar disorder (Table 4). Prevalence
gaps for a suicide note, prior suicide attempt, and affective disorders between suicides and
undetermined deaths were larger among drug intoxication cases than gunshot/hanging cases.
Multilevel, multivariable analysis affirmed our fifth and final hypothesis that observed associa-
tions between psychological and psychiatric characteristics and a suicide versus undetermined
classification were stronger among the drug intoxication cases (Table 5). Relative to their refer-
ent, cases with a note were associated with 45-fold increased odds of a suicide classification for

Even the enriched microdata from the NVDRS showed less than one-third of suicide cases
included a record of a comorbid affective disorder, prior suicide attempt, or authenticated

 suicide note, whether written, typed, digital or audio. Signaling complications for suicide
accounting and prevention, our multilevel, multivariable analysis leads us to infer that full and
accurate accounting of suicide by opioid and other drug intoxication in the US is far more
dependent upon corroborative psychological and psychiatric evidence than is that of suicide
by the other two major but overtly violent methods, firearm and hanging/suffocation. We
hypothesize that absence of such evidence increases the likelihood that drug intoxication sui-
cides are misclassified in the accident manner of death category, as well as in undetermined.
Against the background of highly stressed emergency healthcare [7,8] and medicolegal death
investigation systems [9,10], our findings both reinforce and inform concern and skepticism
about the uniformity and validity of suicide and default manner of death classifications in the
US [32,42–44].
During the late 1980s, CDC convened an expert multidisciplinary panel to develop opera-
tional criteria for suicide determination [45]. This panel recommended that injury deaths be
classified as suicide if the injury was consistent with self-infliction and there was indication of
intent. They also recommended medical examiners and coroners utilize multiple data sources in
their investigations, including sources that would facilitate identification of the psychological
and psychiatric characteristics of suicides and possible suicides. In cases where intent was equiv-
ocal, medical examiners and coroners would need to consult psychiatrists or clinical psycholo-
gists proficient in assessing self-harm proximal to death in order to optimize suicide
ascertainment [13]. However, there continues to be no such auxiliary workforce in the US to
support suicide investigations, unlike police in homicide investigations, whose training and ser-
vice focus on ruling homicide in or out in death scene and other medicolegal death investiga-
tions [46]. Moreover, medical examiners and coroners rarely employ any formal psychological
inquiry in helping them resolve intentionality or manner of death in ambiguous, uncertain, and
equivocal cases, epitomized by most drug poisoning deaths [11,47]. Such procedures, in some
settings called a “psychological autopsy,” integrate interviews with key informants—family,
friends, and acquaintances of decedents—and intensive records review and examination [17,48].
Heterogeneity of forensic investigation systems, within and across states, may impede accu-
rate classification of suicide and other manners of death in the US [31,49]. With no national
oversight, administration of death investigation systems varies from state control under an
appointed state medical examiner to county control under an elected coroner or a medical
examiner [50]. Contrasting with medical examiners, coroners typically lack training in medi-
cine, pathology or forensic pathology. Training in psychiatry or clinical psychology is not a
requisite for either position. Compounding threats to the quality of injury-related manner of
death data, most coroner offices were not professionally accredited by either the International
Association of Coroners & Medical Examiners or the National Association of Medical Exam-
iners, as of January 2015 [51].
In 2015, CDC hosted an expert meeting to commence addressing the inherent challenges
fatal opioid and other drug intoxication cases pose for medical examiner and coroners in accu-
rately assigning suicide and other manners of death [52]. Our research will fortify the empiri-
cal underpinnings of this important and ongoing initiative.
Strengths and limitations
The first multilevel investigation of the association between psychological/psychiatric documen-
tation and suicide manner of death classification in the US, and in the world to the best of our
knowledge, this study was able to factor in heterogeneity across precipitating circumstances of
death, medicolegal death investigation systems and practices, and demographics. Only the
microdata from the NVDRS Restricted Access Database were appropriate for evaluating our

 research questions. Essential for valid geographic, sociodemographic, and temporal accounting
and comparisons, the NVDRS emphasizes uniform protocols for defining manner of death and
achieving consistent data collection, entry, review, and coding practices [33]. However, the affir-
mation of hypothesized variation between suicides and undetermined deaths is likely conserva-
tive as a consequence. Tempering this caveat on study generalizability is the countervailing
demographic concordance we reported between the 17 NVDRS states and the nation. We note
that since our observation period, 2011–2013, the NVDRS has expanded to 40 states, the Dis-
trict of Columbia, and Puerto Rico [1]. The goal is to cover all 50 states and territories.
NVDRS data do not include staffing and budgetary information on medicolegal offices, and
data collection is not yet uniform and standardized for mental health, substance use, and other
circumstances of death. Toxicology is nearly complete in drug and other poisoning cases, but
fiscal constraints and associated data deficits make coverage problematic for surveillance and
research in non-poisoning cases [53]. The “yes” provision means affirmative for circumstances
of the suicide and undetermined deaths, but “no” entries are not distinguished from unknown
or missing information—a conservative bias. The NVDRS neither documents comorbid dis-
eases, such as cancer and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which are risk factors for suicide
[54], nor differentiates prescription opioids from illicit analogs. Data sparseness in our multi-
level study precluded more refined distinctions among injury mechanisms/causes and separa-
tion of centralized and decentralized medicolegal death investigation systems.
Conclusions
Without psychological/psychiatric evidence contributing to manner of death classification,
suicide by drug intoxication in the US is likely profoundly under-reported. Findings harbor
adverse implications for surveillance, etiologic understanding, and prevention of suicides and
drug deaths.
