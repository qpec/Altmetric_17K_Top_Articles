AIMS
Previous studies have suggested that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be associated with higher cardiovas-
cular risks. However, few have been active comparison studies that directly assessed the potential differential cardiovascular risk
between NSAID classes or across individual NSAIDs. We compared the risk of major cardiovascular events between cyclooxy-
genase 2 (COX-2)-selective and nonselective NSAIDs in patients with hypertension.
METHODS
We conducted a cohort study of patients with hypertension who initiated COX-2-selective or nonselective NSAIDs in a
population-based Taiwanese database. The outcomes included hospitalization for the following major cardiovascular events:
ischaemic stroke, acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, transient ischaemic attack, unstable angina or coronary
revascularization. We followed patients for up to 4 weeks, based on the as-treated principle. We used inverse probability
weighting to control for baseline and time-varying covariates, and estimated the on-treatment hazard ratios (HRs) and 95%
conservative confidence interval (CIs).
RESULTS
We identified 2749 eligible COX-2-selective NSAID users and 52 880 eligible nonselective NSAID users. The HR of major cardio-
vascular events comparing COX-2-selective with nonselective NSAIDs after adjusting for baseline and time-varying covariates was
1.07 (95% CI 0.65, 1.74). We did not observe a differential risk when comparing celecoxib to diclofenac (HR 1.17; 95% CI 0.61,
2.25), ibuprofen (HR 1.36; 95% CI 0.58, 3.18) or naproxen (HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.23, 2.44). There was an increased risk with
COX-2-selective NSAIDs, however, when comparing COX-2-selective NSAIDs with mefenamic acid (HR 2.11; 95% CI 1.09, 4.09).
CONCLUSIONS
Our results provide important information about the comparative cardiovascular safety of NSAIDs in patients with hypertension.

 WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT
• A number of studies have suggested that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including cyclooxygenase
2(COX-2)-selective and nonselective NSAIDs, are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular adverse outcomes.
• It is unclear if there is a differential cardiovascular risk between NSAID classes or across individual NSAIDs because there
have been limited active comparison studies, especially in patients with hypertension.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
• In this population-based cohort study, which included 55 629 patients with hypertension, we observed no difference in
cardiovascular risk between patients who were on COX-2-selective and nonselective NSAID treatment.
• There was no apparent difference in cardiovascular risk when comparing celecoxib with diclofenac, ibuprofen or
naproxen, although a significantly increased risk was observed when comparing celecoxib with mefenamic acid.
• Our results provide important information about the comparative safety of various NSAIDs in patients with hypertension
in real-world settings. The findings suggest that with a low-to-moderate daily dose and a short-term treatment period,
most commonly used NSAIDs, including celecoxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen and naproxen, have similar cardiovascular
safety profiles.
Introduction
Nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
(NSAIDs)
inhibit
cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX, including COX-1 and
COX-2) and are classified as COX-2-selective and nonselec-
tive
NSAIDs
based
on
their
selectivity
for
COX-2
inhibition. Both types of NSAIDs are widely used for their
anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving effects. The cardio-
vascular safety of NSAIDs, however, has been a subject of
considerable debate for decades [1, 2]. The Vioxx Gastroin-
testinal Outcome Research (VIGOR) trial raised a concern
about a higher risk of myocardial infarction (MI) associated
with rofecoxib in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, lead-
ing to the voluntary withdrawal of rofecoxib from the
market in 2004 [3, 4]. Since then, multiple randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies reported
that other COX-2-selective and nonselective NSAIDs may
also be associated with adverse cardiovascular thrombotic
events [5–9].
There is still conflicting evidence about the comparative
cardiovascular safety of NSAIDs. Some research has suggested
that
the
harmful
cardiovascular
effect
observed
with
rofecoxib may not be a class effect for all COX-2-selective
NSAIDs, and that the cardiovascular risk may also vary across
individual nonselective NSAIDs, with naproxen having a bet-
ter safety profile [10, 11]. One early meta-analysis of RCTs,
mainly
conducted
in
arthritis
patients,
suggested
that
COX-2-selective NSAIDs, as a class, have a higher risk of MI
than nonselective NSAIDs, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.46
[95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02, 2.09] [12]. However, two
large-scale, non-inferior RCTs in arthritis patients [13, 14]
and some active comparison observational studies in elderly
patients or those hospitalized for coronary heart disease
(CHD) [15–18] found no difference in cardiovascular risk
when
comparing
individual
COX-2-selective
NSAIDs
(celecoxib and etoricoxib) with individual nonselective
NSAIDs (diclofenac, ibuprofen and naproxen). A recent ob-
servational study in Canadian and European healthcare data-
bases also suggested that, as compared to non-use of NSAIDs,
the risk of MI with celecoxib did not appear to be higher than
that with diclofenac, ibuprofen and naproxen in the general
population [19].
Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular dis-
eases [20], and the destabilization of blood pressure is a
potential effect modifier of NSAID-related cardiovascular
events [21, 22]. Few studies, however, have used an active
comparison approach to compare the safety spectrum among
different NSAIDs in this population. Previous studies have
found that patient characteristics and treatment duration
may differ between COX-2-selective and nonselective NSAID
users [15–18]. We aimed to examine the risk of major cardio-
vascular events in patients with hypertension taking COX-2-
selective vs. nonselective NSAIDs. Specifically, we used in-
verse probability weighting to account for potential baseline
and time-dependent confounding and differential follow-
up, and modelled the cardiovascular risk associated with up
to 4 weeks of continuous NSAID use.
Methods
Data source and source population
A single-payer National Health Insurance programme began
in Taiwan in 1995, achieving an enrolment rate of 99% by
2014. The National Health Research Institute constructed
the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD),
which consisted of linked data from demographic and
enrolment records, hospital admissions, outpatient visits
and pharmacy dispensing claims from hospitals, outpatient
clinics and community pharmacies. The source population
for the study included all beneficiaries in the Longitudinal
Health Insurance Database, which comprised a random
sample of one million individuals from the NHIRD with
longitudinally linked, annually updated data, with the
exception of information about deaths. The study protocol
was approved by the National Taiwan University Hospital
Research Ethics Committee.
Study population and study drugs
We
identified
patients
initiating
treatment
with
oral
COX-selective or nonselective NSAIDs at outpatient visits be-
tween 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2012 using the World
Health Organization’s Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical

 (ATC) classification system codes (see Table S1 for a list of
codes). We defined NSAID initiation as the first oral NSAID
dispensed during the study period, with no dispensing for
oral or intravenous forms of NSAIDs in the preceding
180 days. The index date was the date of the first dispensing
of a study NSAID. To ensure that sufficient data were
available to capture baseline characteristics, we excluded
patients with fewer than 180 days of continuous enrolment
before the index date and required patients to have at least
one inpatient or outpatient visits during this time window.
We further restricted the cohort to patients having at least
one inpatient or two outpatient diagnoses of hypertension
[International
Classification
of
Diseases,
9th
Revision,
Clinical modification (ICD-9-CM) codes 401–405] in the
180 days before the index date [23]. We excluded patients
aged under 20 years on the index date, patients with
missing age or ambiguous gender information, and patients
initiating both a COX-2-selective and nonselective NSAID
on the index date.
Follow-up and outcomes
We defined the outcomes of interest – major cardiovascular
events – as the first hospitalization for ischaemic stroke, acute
MI, congestive heart failure, transient ischaemic attack,
unstable angina and coronary revascularization (including
coronary artery bypass grafting and percutaneous translumi-
nal coronary angioplasty) during follow-up. We defined each
outcome using validated claims-based algorithms (Table S2)
with positive predictive values of 88% for ischaemic stroke
[24], 80% for acute MI [25], 84% for congestive heart failure
[26], 77% for transient ischaemic attack [27], 88% for
unstable angina [28], 98% for coronary artery bypass grafting
[29] and 95–96% for percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty [29]. As congestive heart failure may be indirectly
related to renal effects rather than the thromboembolic
effects of NSAIDs, we also conducted another analysis that
excluded
congestive
heart
failure
from
the
outcome
definition.
To minimize the possibility of exposure misclassification
during the follow-up, we followed patients based on the as-
treated principle. Specifically, we followed patients for up to
28 days (i.e. 4 weeks), from the index date to the earliest of
the following: outcome occurrence; index NSAID treatment
discontinuation; NSAID treatment change; or last date of
hospital discharge, outpatient visit or community phar-
macy
visit.
NSAID
treatment
discontinuation
occurred
when more than 14 days elapsed between the end of one
dispensing and the date of the next dispensing, if any.
NSAID treatment change (switch or addition) occurred
when an NSAID was dispensed that was different from the
index
study
drug
(i.e.
a
patient
with
an
index
COX-2-selective NSAID filling a nonselective NSAID, and
vice versa). As our data source did not include information
on deaths, we censored patients on the last date of their
hospital discharge, outpatient visit or community phar-
macy visit during follow-up, to reduce potential outcome
misclassification or biases associated with the inability to
capture
cardiovascular-related
deaths
(i.e.
misclassifying
patients who have died due to cardiovascular causes as
being
alive
and
having
no
cardiovascular
outcomes).
Disenrollment from the National Health Insurance pro-
gramme was uncommon.
Covariate assessment and adjustment
We considered two groups of covariates: baseline and time-
varying covariates. Baseline covariates included age on the
index
date,
gender,
calendar
year
of
the
index
date,
comorbidities, other medication use and resource utilization
recorded
within 180 days
before the index
date. We
ascertained comorbidities based on inpatient and outpatient
diagnosis files, and determined medication use based on the
pharmacy dispensing claims of outpatient clinics and com-
munity pharmacies. We measured resource utilization based
on the records of hospital admissions and outpatient visits.
Time-varying covariates included cardiovascular comor-
bidities and cardiovascular medications, updated weekly
during the follow-up period. For cardiovascular comorbidi-
ties, provided that patients had one comorbidity at any
time during follow-up, the status would be carried forward
through
the
remainder
of
their
follow-up
period.
For
cardiovascular
medications,
whether
patients
used
one
medication in a week depended on the pharmacy claim
records in that week. Therefore, patients might use one
drug in one week and then discontinue it in the following
week. Tables S3 and S4 provide more detailed information
on covariates.
Statistical analysis
We applied two analytical approaches. In the first approach,
we adjusted for confounding and potential selection bias
arising from differential loss to follow-up using measured
baseline covariates only. Specifically, we used all measured
baseline covariates to estimate the inverse probability of
treatment weight (IPTW) and the inverse probability of
censoring weight (IPCW) [30, 31]. The IPTW was calculated
as the inverse of the treatment probability, given all measured
baseline covariates, and the IPCW was calculated as the
inverse of the probability of remaining uncensored, given
treatment status and all measured baseline covariates. To
reduce the variability of the weights, we ‘stabilized’ them by
replacing the numerator of the IPTW by the average treat-
ment probability, and the numerator of the IPCW by the
probability of remaining uncensored, given the treatment
status and select baseline covariates. We fitted logistic
regression models to estimate all the probabilities. Appendix
S1 describes the computation steps in detail.
We then multiplied the stabilized IPTW and the stabilized
IPCW, to obtain an overall weight for each patient. This
allowed us to create a weighted population in which the
receipt of NSAID treatment and loss to follow-up were
independent
of
the
measured
baseline
covariates.
We
truncated the overall weight at the first and 99th percentile
cut-points, to minimize further the influence of extreme
weights. With a person-week data structure, we used the
generalized estimating equations and the robust variance es-
timators to fit a weighted pooled logistic regression model,
which approximated a weighted Cox model, and estimated
HRs and conservative 95% CIs of major cardiovascular
events. As we followed patients based on the as-treated
principle, the HRs would represent the on-treatment effect
Cardiovascular safety of NSAIDs in patients with hypertension

1047
 while patients remained on their index COX-2-selective
NSAID treatment vs. patients who remained on their index
nonselective NSAID treatment during the follow-up.
In the second approach, we repeated the same steps as
above, except that now we estimated the stabilized IPTW
and stabilized IPCW using both baseline and time-varying
covariates
updated
weekly,
and
fitted
pooled
logistic
regression models to estimate all the probabilities [32–35].
The denominator of the stabilized IPTW was the treatment
probability, given the treatment history, all measured base-
line covariates and all measured time-varying covariates; the
denominator of the stabilized IPCW was the probability of
remaining uncensored, given the treatment history, all
measured baseline covariates and all measured time-varying
covariates. The numerator of the stabilized IPTW was the
treatment probability, given the treatment history and select
baseline covariates; the numerator of the stabilized IPCW was
the probability of remaining uncensored, given the treat-
ment history and select baseline covariates. Appendix S2
provides detailed computation steps.
Subgroup and sensitivity analyses
To examine if the HR would be different across individual
nonselective NSAIDs, we conducted additional analyses to
compare COX-2-selective NSAIDs (celecoxib and etoricoxib)
separately
with
diclofenac,
ibuprofen,
naproxen
and
mefenamic acid, which are expected to be commonly used
in clinical settings.
We also conducted several sensitivity analyses, to exam-
ine the robustness of our results. First, use of low-dose aspirin
is a potential marker for patients’ underlying cardiovascular
risk. Therefore, we additionally included the interaction term
of NSAID use and low-dose aspirin in the outcome model, to
examine if there was any effect modification by patients’ un-
derlying cardiovascular risk. Secondly, we performed a ‘first
exposure carried forward’ (or ‘intention-to-treat’) analysis
by following patients regardless of NSAID treatment discon-
tinuation or change and censoring them only at the first out-
come occurrence, the last date of accessing medical resources
or 28 days from the index date.
Thirdly, besides using inverse probability weighting to ad-
just for both baseline and time-varying covariates, we esti-
mated propensity scores (PSs) – the probabilities of initiating
COX-2-selective NSAIDs – using all measured baseline covari-
ates and conducted PS matching to minimize confounding ef-
fects by baseline covariates. We also performed inverse
probability weighting after PS matching, to account for
time-varying covariates. Finally, we used high-dimensional
PSs (hd-PSs) to identify and include an additional 50 empiri-
cally identified variables in the PS model [36, 37].

Results
Baseline characteristics
We identified a total of 55 629 eligible patients (Figure 1).
Among patients initiating COX-2-selective NSAIDs (N = 2749),
celecoxib
(65%)
was
prescribed
more
commonly
than
etoricoxib (35%). Among patients initiating nonselective
NSAIDs (N = 52 880), diclofenac (34%), mefenamic acid
(22%) and ibuprofen (15%) were most commonly prescribed;
only 3% of patients initiated naproxen. The mean [standard
deviation (SD)] age of the cohort was 64 (13) years and 51%
were male. Compared with patients initiating nonselective
NSAIDs, patients initiating COX-2-selective NSAIDs were
more likely to be older and female, and appeared to have more
comorbidities, more medication use and higher resource utili-
zation (Table 1).
After applying the stabilized IPTW derived from baseline
covariates,
the
balance
in
baseline
covariates
between
COX-2-selective and nonselective NSAID groups improved,
with most of the covariates showing an absolute standardized
difference of less than 0.1, although there were still slight dif-
ferences between treatment groups (Table 1). Tables S5–S8
show differences in baseline covariates when comparing
COX-2-selective NSAIDs to individual nonselective NSAIDs.
Table S9 presents the distributions of stabilized IPTW and
IPCW weights.
Follow-up and outcomes
The
mean
follow-up
duration
was
24
days
for
COX-2-selective
NSAIDs
and
18
days
for
nonselective
NSAIDs. The crude incidence rate was 122 per 1000 person-
years (based on 22 outcome events) in the COX-2-selective
NSAID group and 76 per 1000 person-years (based on 193
events) in the nonselective NSAID group (Table 2). There
were 7919 patients (14% of the study cohort) who remained
uncensored 4 weeks after the cohort entry. COX-2-selective
NSAID initiators were more likely to be uncensored than non-
selective NSAID initiators (proportion of remaining uncen-
sored:
50%
vs.
12%).
The
mean
daily
dose
used
for
individual NSAIDs was: 210 mg for celecoxib, 60 mg for
etoricoxib, 107 mg for diclofenac, 1084 mg for ibuprofen,
694 mg for naproxen and 1248 mg for mefenamic acid.
Risk of major cardiovascular events comparing
COX-2-selective vs. nonselective NSAIDs
The crude HR of major cardiovascular events comparing
COX-2-selective vs. nonselective NSAIDs in the primary on-
treatment analysis was 1.99 (95% CI, 1.28, 3.09) (Table 3).
The adjusted HR was 1.09 (95% CI 0.64, 1.86) in the analysis
that adjusted only for baseline covariates. After adjusting for
both baseline and time-varying covariates, the adjusted HR
was 1.07 (95% CI 0.65, 1.74). There were 137 events (13 for
COX-2-selective NSAIDs and 124 for nonselective NSAIDs)
when we excluded congestive heart failure from the outcome
definition. The adjusted HR did not change materially (1.07;
95% CI 0.56, 2.04).
Comparing COX-2-selective NSAIDs vs. individual nonse-
lective NSAIDs yielded adjusted HRs of: 0.91 (95% CI 0.51,
1.63) vs. diclofenac; 1.22 (95% CI 0.58, 2.57) vs. ibuprofen;
Y.-H. Dong et al.
1048
Br J Clin Pharmacol (2018) 84 1045–1056
 0.67 (95% CI 0.24, 1.91) vs. naproxen; and 1.63 (95% CI 0.91,
2.93) vs. mefenamic acid (Table 3). We observed no differen-
tial risks of major cardiovascular events when comparing
celecoxib with diclofenac (adjusted HR 1.17; 95% CI 0.61,
2.25), ibuprofen (adjusted HR 1.36; 95% CI 0.58, 3.18) or
naproxen (adjusted HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.23, 2.44). Neverthe-
less, there was a significantly increased risk when comparing
celecoxib with mefenamic acid (adjusted HR 2.11; 95% CI
1.09, 4.09). We could not compare etoricoxib with individual
nonselective NSAIDs separately because of limited outcome
events for etoricoxib. Use of low-dose aspirin did not
significantly modify the adjusted HRs of celecoxib vs.
diclofenac (P-value for interaction: 0.17), celecoxib vs.
ibuprofen (P = 0.27), celecoxib vs. naproxen (P = 0.20) or
celecoxib vs. mefenamic acid (P = 0.13).
Table S10 shows the findings for each comparison using
the ‘first exposure carried forward‘ approach; these were sim-
ilar to the results using the as-treated approach. When we ap-
plied PS matching to control for baseline covariates, we
observed numerically elevated HRs comparing celecoxib vs.
diclofenac (1.44; 95% CI 0.68, 3.04), ibuprofen (1.43; 95%
CI 0.57, 3.50) and mefenamic acid (2.12; 95% CI 0.88,
3.08). The HR comparing celecoxib vs. naproxen was 0.74
(95% CI 0.21, 2.65). After applying inverse probability
weighting to handle time-varying covariates further in the
PS-matched analysis, the adjusted HRs of celecoxib vs.
diclofenac (1.20; 95% CI 0.51, 2.80) and celecoxib vs.
ibuprofen (1.05; 95% CI 0.37, 2.98) attenuated toward the
null, while celecoxib still showed a different, but not signifi-
cantly so, risk profile vs. mefenamic acid (adjusted HR 1.83;
95% CI 0.70, 4.81). The HR comparing celecoxib vs.
naproxen did not change materially (0.74; 95% CI 0.21,
2.68) (Table S11). In general, the results based on baseline
PS matching followed by inverse probability weighting did
not differ substantially compared with those from the main
analysis of using inverse probability weighting for both base-
line and time-varying covariates, although the risk estimates
tended to be more imprecise. The analysis with hd-PS
matching followed by inverse probability weighting yielded
similar results, although risk estimates for some comparisons
could not be calculated because we were unable to match
enough patients initiating nonselective NSAIDs to each pa-
tient initiating COX-2-selective NSAIDs in the matching step
(Table S12).
Discussion
In the present longitudinal, population-based cohort study,
we examined the cardiovascular safety of NSAIDs in patients
with hypertension by using inverse probability weighting to
account for baseline and time-varying covariates alike. There
was no strong evidence to suggest a higher cardiovascular risk

 with COX-2-selective NSAIDs (celecoxib and etoricoxib) or
celecoxib alone compared with diclofenac, ibuprofen and
naproxen. However, we observed an elevated risk when
comparing celecoxib with mefenamic acid.
Biological plausibility of NSAID-associated
cardiovascular thrombotic effects
The mechanisms of NSAID-associated cardiovascular throm-
botic effects have not been comprehensively elucidated. It
has been hypothesized that COX-2-selective NSAIDs inhibit
the synthesis of prostacyclin (PGI2) but not thrombox-
ane A2, which leads to an imbalance between these two
eicosanoids
and
an
increase
in
platelet
aggregation,
vasoconstriction and cardiovascular-related adverse events
[1, 2]. The extent of COX-2 inhibition can be quantified
based on the ratio of the concentrations required to pro-
duce a 50% inhibition in the activity of the isozymes (i.e.
COX-1/COX-2 IC50 value), with a higher value indicating
greater COX-2 selectivity. COX-2 selectivity for rofecoxib
(255) is higher than for etoricoxib (162), celecoxib (32),
diclofenac (24), ibuprofen (0.6) and naproxen (0.5) [40, 41].
Comparison with other studies
It remains to be determined whether COX-2-selective NSAIDs
have a different cardiovascular safety profile than nonselective
NSAIDs. COX-2-selective NSAIDs as a class, including rofecoxib,

 lumiracoxib, valdecoxib, celecoxib and etoricoxib, have been
linked to a higher risk of MI than nonselective NSAIDs in a
meta-analysis of RCTs that included primarily arthritis patients
[12]. However, two RCTs of arthritis patients found no signifi-
cant differences in thrombotic cardiovascular events across indi-
vidual NSAIDs [13, 14]. In the 18-month Multinational
Etoricoxib and Diclofenac Arthritis Long-term (MEDAL) pro-
gramme [13], the HR for thrombotic cardiovascular events was
0.95 (95% CI 0.81, 1.11) for etoricoxib (60–90 mg daily) vs.
diclofenac (150 mg daily). In the 30-month Prospective
Randomized Evaluation of Celecoxib Integrated Safety versus
Ibuprofen or Naproxen (PRECISION) trial [14], the HR for
thrombotic cardiovascular events was 0.82 (95% CI 0.69, 0.97)
for celecoxib (around 200 mg daily) vs. ibuprofen (around
2000 mg daily) and 0.95 (95% CI 0.80, 1.13) for celecoxib
(around 200 mg daily) vs. naproxen (around 850 mg daily). Sim-
ilarly, cohort studies conducted in elderly patients or in patients
hospitalized for serious CHD detected no difference in the risk of
MI, stroke or recurrent serious CHD comparing celecoxib with
diclofenac [15], ibuprofen [15, 16] or naproxen [17, 18].
Our findings of no significant difference in cardiovascular
risk
between
COX-2-selective
NSAIDs
(celecoxib
and
etoricoxib) or celecoxib alone and several individual nonse-
lective NSAIDs (ibuprofen, diclofenac and naproxen) in
patients with hypertension are in line with previous non-
inferior RCTs [13, 14] and active comparison observational
studies [15–18]. However, we observed that celecoxib had an
apparent
higher
cardiovascular
risk
compared
with
mefenamic acid. There have been a number of studies
evaluating the cardiovascular risk associated with mefenamic
acid compared with no NSAID treatment, but the results have
been mixed [42–44]. The mean daily dose of mefenamic acid
used in our study was lower than the normal daily dose
(1248 mg vs. 1500 mg). Mefenamic acid is commonly used
for dysmenorrhoea and dental pain, rather than arthritis in
clinical settings, and patients may tend to take the drug
irregularly. Mefenamic acid might thus be less likely to inter-
fere with the COX system and present a lower cardiovascular
risk than celecoxib. However, this was the only statistically
significant result out of the many subgroup analyses. There-
fore, the possibility that this was a chance finding could not
be ruled out. Further studies are required to examine the
underlying mechanisms and replicate our findings.
The dosage and treatment duration of NSAIDs might play
a role in cardiovascular risk [6, 19, 45]. Patients included in
the MEDAL programme and in the PRECISION trial received
moderate-to-high daily doses of NSAIDs with a longer treat-
ment duration [13, 14]. The mean daily dose was lower and
the treatment duration shorter in our study compared with
the MEDAL program and the PRECISION trial, but the use
pattern reflected actual use in real-world clinical settings.
These differences may partially explain our neutral findings
across these individual NSAIDs. The pattern of low-dose,
short-term use of NSAIDs was also observed in three German,
UK and French adult cohorts [46–48].
Strengths and weaknesses of the study
As hypertension is a prevalent condition and a major risk
factor for cardiovascular diseases [20], our results provide
important information about the comparative safety of
alternative NSAID use, and suggest that most commonly used
NSAIDs, including naproxen, have similar cardiovascular
safety profiles in this vulnerable population. Our results also
suggest that the relationship between NSAIDs and cardiovas-
cular risk is complex, and that it might be more appropriate to
describe NSAID-associated cardiovascular safety by individ-
ual drug rather than as a whole drug class.
Consistent with previous observational studies [15–18], our
study found that patients receiving COX-2-selective NSAIDs
were sicker and tended to have a longer treatment duration
than those receiving nonselective NSAIDs. Unlike previous
studies, which usually considered baseline confounding only,
our study simultaneously accounted for baseline and time-
varying confounding and potential selection bias due to
informative censoring using inverse probability weighting.
The method accounts for time-varying confounders more
appropriately compared with conventional regression ap-
proaches [32–35]. The results were also qualitatively similar
when we applied conventional PS or hd-PS matching to adjust
for baseline covariates, and inverse probability weighting to
account further for time-varying covariates.
There were several limitations to our study. First, phar-
macy claims data provide accurate information about the
prescriptions that are filled but do not necessarily reflect
whether and when patients take the drugs. However, most
NSAIDs (>90% of approved products) are available via a pre-
scription and are reimbursed by the National Health Insur-
ance programme in Taiwan. This allowed us to ascertain
exposure status more comprehensively than other database
studies, which often have incomplete capture of NSAIDs
due to considerable over-the-counter use. Secondly, the
number of outcome events was limited for individual NSAIDs
in our study, and several analyses might have been under-
powered. For example, there were only seven outcome events
for
naproxen,
so
the
adjusted
HRs
comparing
COX-2-selective NSAIDs vs. naproxen (0.67; 95% CI 0.24,
1.91) or celecoxib vs. naproxen (0.75; 95% CI 0.23, 2.44) were
unstable, with wide confidence intervals. However, reassur-
ingly, our findings were in line with previous active compari-
son RCTs and observational studies [13–18]. Furthermore, we
only had five outcome events for etoricoxib and were unable
to compare this agent with individual nonselective NSAIDs.
Similarly, we were also not able to examine individual com-
ponents of the composite cardiovascular outcome. Further re-
search, using the whole Taiwanese population, using an
active comparison study design, is likely to provide more pre-
cise findings.
Thirdly, our data source did not include information on
deaths, which prevented us from evaluating the association
between use of NSAIDs and overall or cardiovascular death.
Finally, the prescribing habits or preferences of health
professionals, different NSAID indications, different safety
warnings, and contraindications might have led to an imbal-
ance in covariates between patients receiving different
NSAIDs. In the current study, we observed that patients who
initiated COX-2-selective NSAIDs were older and had more
comorbidities. We applied different analytical approaches,
including inverse probability weighting, to account for
potential
baseline
and
time-varying
confounders.
The
balance in baseline covariates between treatment groups im-
proved after inverse probability weighting. However, patients

 receiving COX-2-selective NSAIDs still tended to be slightly
sicker than those receiving nonselective NSAIDs, which
might have biased the results further away from the null. In
addition, although we considered a large number of covari-
ates in the analysis, we could not rule out the possibility of
unmeasured confounding, such as education level, smoking
status or body mass index.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the present population-based cohort study
found that, under low-to-moderate daily dose and a short-term
treatment period, there was no apparent difference in cardio-
vascular risk comparing celecoxib with diclofenac, ibuprofen
and naproxen in patients with hypertension. A potential in-
creased cardiovascular risk with celecoxib when compared
with mefenamic acid warrants further investigation.
