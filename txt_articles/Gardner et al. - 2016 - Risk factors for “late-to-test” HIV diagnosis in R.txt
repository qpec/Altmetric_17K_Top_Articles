Abstract
Patients diagnosed late in the course of HIV infection are at an increased risk of negative health outcomes and are more likely to
transmit HIV to others. Using the CDC’s definition for AIDS, we analyzed case report data from persons diagnosed with AIDS within
12 months of an HIV diagnosis (“late-to-test”) in Riverside County, CA, between 2009 and 2014. Of 1385 HIV cases, 422 (30.5%)
were late-to-test. Factors associated with late-to-test were: having no insurance (P=0.005), being Hispanic (P=0.002) and being
between 45 and 64 years of age (P<0.001). Females (P=0.013) and those in the eastern region of Riverside County (P=0.002) were
less likely to be late-to-test. In the absence of universal HIV testing, interventions to decrease late testing are needed.

1. Introduction
As of December 31, 2014, Riverside County, CA, reported 5389
people living with HIV or AIDS. With an HIV prevalence >221
per 100,000 individuals, Riverside County is the sixth most HIV/
AIDS-impacted county in California. Survival rates for HIV-
infected persons have dramatically increased in the United States
since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy
(HAART) in the mid-1990s. However, progress in obtaining
early HIV diagnoses has been slow. The Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate 1.2 million people live
with HIV in the United States, and nearly 13% are unaware of
their infection.[1] Later stage HIV diagnosis (i.e., AIDS diagnosis
within 12 months of seropositive determination) presents
challenges to both individual treatment and public health
prevention strategies.[2,3] More often than not, late-stage patients
do not get tested until symptoms have begun to appear.[2,4,5]
Previous studies indicate these individuals are often from
marginalized groups, groups that do not recognize their risk
potential, or both.[2,6]
Late-stage infection increases the risk of negative health
outcomes, including premature death and substantially increases
the overall treatment cost.[3,7] Furthermore, late diagnosis
increases the odds the unaware patient will transmit HIV.[8]
Nearly half (49%) of all new HIV infections are from those
unaware of their HIV status.[9] Nationally, 25% to 47% of
individuals who present for HIV testing are late in the infection
stage.[10] Previous research has reported persons tested late in the
course of their infection were more likely to be older, male,
uninsured,
and
HIV-infected
through
heterosexual
con-
tact.[2,6,11,12] Being foreign-born has been shown as a risk factor
in some but not all studies.[6] Those reporting injection drug use
(IDUs), men who have sex with men (MSM), and heterosexual
women are more likely to be diagnosed earlier in the course of
their HIV infection.[2,6,12] Inspired by similar work focused
exclusively on AIDS cases in San Francisco, CA[11], we examine
the prevalence and risk factors for Riverside County residents
who have an AIDS diagnosis within 12 months of their first HIV-
positive test.
2. Methods
We used data from the Enhanced HIV/AIDS Reporting System
(eHARS) maintained by the Office of AIDS, California Depart-
ment of Public Health. The eHARS is a web-based application
provided by the CDC to collect, manage, and report California’s
HIV/AIDS case surveillance data to the CDC. Data in eHARS
come from both active and passive surveillance activities such as
public health department review of medical records, laboratory
reports, and health care provider reports. We examined the
eHARS dataset including all persons who met the CDC
surveillance case definition for HIV or AIDS (HIV infection,
stage 3) within Riverside County, CA, from January 2009 to
December 2014 and were reported to the Riverside University
Health System through June 2015. Persons whose initial HIV
diagnosis occurred within 12 months of their AIDS diagnosis
were defined as late-to-test.

 Data obtained from medical records included: age, gender at
birth, race/ethnicity, HIV risk category, insurance status, foreign
born, county region, date of HIV diagnosis, and date of AIDS
diagnosis. Association between sociodemographic variables,
sexual risk behaviors, and late testing was done using Pearson
chi-square testing. Multivariate logistic regression determined
independent predictors of late testing: all variables with a P-value
of 0.2 or less from the initial chi-square test were entered into the
regression model. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) were calculated for the model. SPSS (Version
20.0; SPSS, Armonk, NY, 2011) was used for statistical analysis.
As a public health practice, this evaluation of programmatic data
is exempt from IRB review.
3. Results
The initial analysis included a total of 1424 Riverside County
residents with an HIV diagnosis; 39 cases were excluded due to
incomplete or erroneous HIV or AIDS diagnosis dates. We
created a map of the late-to-test rates (Fig. 1) based on the
remaining 1385 cases (97.3%) used for this analysis.
Of the 1385 cases, more than two-thirds were male (88%),
born in the United States (72%), and either white or Hispanic
(48% and 36%, respectively). Mean age was 39.5 years, with
nearly half (44%) between the ages of 25 and 44 years. Insurance
status for over one-third of participants was unknown (41%),
whereas 22% and 25% had private or public insurance,
respectively. Nearly half of the participants were from western
Riverside County (40%) and the most common reported mode of
HIV transmission was MSM (70%).
Of the total HIV cases, 30.5% (N=422) were late-to-test
(Table 1). Of those classified as late-to-test, 30.8% (N=130)
received their HIV and AIDS diagnoses at the same time.
Bivariate analysis showed late-to-test was more frequent among
Hispanics (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.113–1.88), those between the
ages of 45 to 64 years (OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.96–1.59), and in those
born outside the United States (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.13–2.27).
Those less likely to be late-to-test were under 25 years old (OR
0.36, 95% CI 0.24–0.53), and/or living in the eastern part of
Riverside County (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.57–0.94). Risk category
(i.e., mode of transmission) had a limited effect on late testing (P=
0.77). Factors independently associated with late-to-test were:
havingnoinsurance(OR1.94,95%CI1.22–3.08),beingHispanic
(OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.21–2.26), and being between the ages of
45–64 (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.29–2.29). Females (OR 0.52, 95% CI
0.31–0.87) and those residing in the eastern region of the county
(OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.46–0.84) were less likely to be late-to-test.
4. Discussion
The geographic disparities shown in Fig. 1 indicate one challenge
for
HIV-prevention
efforts
in
the
region.
Although
free
confidential testing is available throughout Riverside County,
>30% of new HIV diagnoses qualified as late-to-test (i.e.,
received an AIDS diagnosis within 12 months of a seropositive
HIV result). With a clinical latency period of up to a decade
from HIV infection to the onset of AIDS, earlier diagnosis is a
critical component in preventing onward transmission of the
virus and represents missed opportunities for treatment.[10]
Previous research suggests that the transmission rate for those

 unaware of their HIV status is 4 times higher (49%–66%) than
via those who know their status.[8,9]
Similar to previous research discussed by Mukolo et al,[6] our
study found increased risk of late HIV testing among those who
were between 45 and 64 years of age and the uninsured; we
additionally found increased risk for late testing among Hispanics
but not other racial/ethnic minorities. Our analysis also found
reduced risk among women and those who live in the eastern part
of the County. The reduced risk in the eastern part of the county is
particularly interesting since >60% of all people living with HIV/
AIDS in Riverside County live in this region.[13] Because of this, it
also has the most extensive HIV education and testing programs,
which may contribute to the reduced risk of late testing.[14]
In contrast to other studies showing an increased risk of late-to-
test for heterosexual males and decreased risk for men who have
sex with men and injection drug users,[2,6,12] we found no
independent association between mode of HIV transmission and
late-to-test.
Several limitations to this study need to be considered when
interpreting the findings. The data used for this analysis were
obtained from mandatory HIV and AIDS case reporting, which
limits the data available for analysis. For example, although the
education level was collected in eHARS, we were unable to include
this in the analysis due to extensive missing data. Also, other
importantsocialdeterminantsdata,suchasincomeoremployment
status, are not collected, nor are specific reasons why individuals
might be late-to-test. Additionally, patients who test late but
responded well to combination antiretroviral therapy, delaying or
preventing onset of AIDS, were excluded from this analysis.
Additionally, we were unable to detect those patients who dropped
out of care for >1 year after initial HIV non-AIDS diagnosis.
Despite these limitations, our analysis provides important
insights. Expansion of testing services, particularly into places
with a high density of uninsured and/or Hispanic residents,
should be pursued. Effort should be made to increase testing in
those 30 years of age and older to account for the clinical latency
period from HIV infection and onset of AIDS. Finally, routine
testing is cost effective, recommended by the CDC, and should be
promoted.[15,16] Routine and universal testing has the capacity to
significantly increase the time period between an HIV-positive
diagnosis to an eventual AIDS diagnosis and can lead to longer
healthier lives for those infected with HIV.
