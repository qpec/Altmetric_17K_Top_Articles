The molecular basis for the decline in experience-dependent neural
plasticity over age remains poorly understood. In visual cortex, the
robust plasticity induced in juvenile mice by brief monocular depri-
vation during the critical period is abrogated by genetic deletion of
Arc, an activity-dependent regulator of excitatory synaptic modifica-
tion. Here, we report that augmenting Arc expression in adult mice
prolongs juvenile-like plasticity in visual cortex, as assessed by
recordings of ocular dominance (OD) plasticity in vivo. A distinguishing
characteristic of juvenile OD plasticity is the weakening of deprived-
eye responses, believed to be accounted for by the mechanisms of
homosynaptic long-term depression (LTD). Accordingly, we also found
increased LTD in visual cortex of adult mice with augmented Arc
expression and impaired LTD in visual cortex of juvenile mice that lack
Arc or have been treated in vivo with a protein synthesis inhibitor.
Further, we found that although activity-dependent expression of Arc
mRNA does not change with age, expression of Arc protein is maximal
during the critical period and declines in adulthood. Finally, we show
that acute augmentation of Arc expression in wild-type adult mouse
visual cortex is sufficient to restore juvenile-like plasticity. Together,
our findings suggest a unifying molecular explanation for the age- and
activity-dependent modulation of synaptic sensitivity to deprivation.
Arc | synaptic plasticity | visual cortex | ocular dominance | critical period
A
defining feature of early postnatal brain development is the
activity-dependent winnowing of synaptic connections. This
process is readily demonstrated by the response of visual cortical
circuits to temporary monocular deprivation (MD) during early
life. When MD is initiated during an early critical period, the
synapses serving the deprived eye in visual cortex lose strength
and are eliminated. Deprived-eye depression diminishes with age
such that by the onset of adolescence, circuits are less vulnerable
to the effects of deprivation. Understanding the molecular
mechanisms that underlie the effect of age on this type of ocular
dominance (OD) plasticity is considered one of the great chal-
lenges in neuroscience (1).
It is now well established that OD plasticity after MD occurs
through synaptic plasticity of excitatory transmission, using mech-
anisms that include homosynaptic long-term depression (LTD),
metaplasticity, and homeostatic scaling of AMPA-type glutamate
receptors (2, 3). Clues to the molecular basis for the decline in
juvenile plasticity have come from several diverse experimental
treatments that can restore or prolong sensitivity to MD in adult
animals. These include genetic manipulations that slow the matu-
ration of cortical inhibition (4, 5), enrichment of animal housing
conditions (6), increased exposure to visual stimulation (7), and
enhanced modulatory neurotransmission (8). It has been suggested
that a common thread connecting these varied treatments might be
an increase in the ratio of excitation to inhibition (9, 10). However,
it is completely unknown how, at the molecular level, general in-
creases in cortical activity can facilitate deprivation-induced syn-
aptic plasticity in adult visual cortex. Since the immediate early
gene Arc is exquisitely sensitive to changes in cortical activity, and
is essential for both OD plasticity and modification of excitatory
synaptic transmission (11–13), we set out to determine whether
availability of Arc limits or changes the qualities of plasticity in
adults and whether up-regulating Arc levels in adult animals can
restore juvenile synaptic plasticity.
Results
Augmentation of Arc Expression in Adult Mouse Visual Cortex
Extends the Critical Period of Juvenile OD Plasticity. In young mice
[≤ postnatal day (P) 40], the main consequence of short (3–4 d)
MD is the robust loss of cortical responsiveness to stimulation of
the deprived eye. A compensatory potentiation of responses to
the nondeprived eye may also occur, and is typically observed
with longer periods of MD (5–7 d) (14). Importantly, although
open-eye potentiation after long-duration MD is common in
adult rodents, deprived-eye depression typically is only observed
during the juvenile critical period in animals housed under
standard laboratory conditions (15, 16). We predicted that aug-
menting Arc levels would prolong juvenile plasticity, as defined
by closed-eye depression, past the conventional critical period in
mouse visual cortex. To test this hypothesis, we used a transgenic
(Tg) mouse line that expresses an additional allele of Arc tagged
with mCherry that is driven by the activity-dependent Arc pro-
moter in a similar manner to the previously characterized Arc-
GFP Tg mouse line (17, 18) (Fig. S1).
We compared the qualities of OD plasticity after short (3–4 d)
MD in Arc-Tg mice and wild-type (WT) littermate controls at
P30 (juvenile) and P180 (adult) using chronic recordings of
Significance
Neuronal plasticity peaks early in life during critical periods and
normally declines with age, but the molecular changes that
underlie this decline are not fully understood. Using the mouse
visual cortex as a model, we found that activity-dependent
expression of the neuronal protein Arc peaks early in life, and
that loss of activity-dependent Arc expression parallels loss of
synaptic plasticity in the visual cortex. Genetic overexpression
of Arc prolongs the critical period of visual cortex plasticity,
and acute viral expression of Arc in adult mice can restore
juvenile-like plasticity. These findings provide a mechanism for
the loss of excitatory plasticity with age, and suggest that Arc
may be an exciting therapeutic target for modulation of the
malleability of neuronal circuits.

 visually evoked potentials (VEPs) from binocular visual cortex
contralateral (contra) to the deprived eye (Fig. 1A) as previously
described (11). There was no significant difference between P30
WT and Arc-Tg VEPs before MD, and following MD, both WT
and Arc-Tg P30 mice exhibited a significant decrease in contra
(closed-eye) VEP amplitudes (WT: n = 7, baseline = 251 ± 28 μV,
post-MD = 166 ± 12 μV, P = 0.03; Arc-Tg: n = 10, baseline =
227 ± 21 μV, post-MD = 159 ± 22 μV, P = 0.01 by paired t test;
Fig. 1B). As expected, adult P180 WT mice did not exhibit
depression of contra VEP amplitude after MD, reflecting the loss
of juvenile plasticity. In sharp contrast, P180 Arc-Tg mice still
exhibited a significant decrease in contra VEPs (WT: n = 7, base-
line = 184 ± 19 μV, post-MD = 183 ± 20 μV, P = 0.9; Arc-Tg: n =
6, baseline = 208 ± 26 μV, post-MD = 136 ± 20 μV, P = 0.02 by
paired t test; Fig. 1C), comparable to the decrease observed in WT
juveniles. There was a significant treatment by genotype interaction,
indicating that OD plasticity differs in Arc-Tg mice compared with
WT mice (P = 0.0092, repeated measures ANOVA).
Because the chronic VEP method enables measurements of
response strength in the same mouse before and after MD, we
can also analyze the qualities of the OD shift by plotting the
fractional changes in response magnitude to stimulation of the
deprived contra eye and the nondeprived ipsilateral (ipsi) eye
(19, 20). This analysis confirms that at P30, both WT and Arc-Tg
mice exhibit robust and comparable levels of contra eye de-
pression and a variable potentiation of the nondeprived ipsi eye
[Fig. 1D, squares; WT: contra depression = 0.7 ± 0.1, ipsi po-
tentiation = 1.4 ± 0.2; Arc-Tg: contra depression = 0.7 ± 0.1, ipsi
potentiation = 1.3 ± 0.1; P = 0.9, multivariate ANOVA
(MANOVA)]. There was, however, a significant difference in
the qualities of OD plasticity in WT and Arc-Tg adult mice (Fig.
1D, circles). In WT mice, the OD shift was accounted for entirely
by ipsi eye potentiation (Fig. 1D, open circles), whereas the shift
in Arc-Tg mice (Fig. 1D, filled circles) was solely due to contra
eye depression (WT: contra depression = 1.0 ± 0.01, ipsi po-
tentiation = 1.3 ± 0.1; Arc-Tg: contra depression = 0.7 ± 0.1, ipsi
potentiation = 0.9 ± 0.2; P = 0.03, MANOVA; Fig. 1D).
These data show that augmenting Arc levels in adult mice
prolongs juvenile-like OD plasticity, as evidenced by deprivation-
induced synaptic depression well past the conventional critical
period in mice.
Activity-Dependent Arc Protein Expression Is High During the Critical
Period and Low in Adulthood. We reasoned that if availability of
Arc influences the qualities of OD plasticity, Arc expression
might decline as the animal ages. In mouse visual cortex, Arc is
first detected after eye-opening (∼P14) and expression steadily
increases until ∼P30, corresponding to the age of peak sensitivity
to MD (21). To determine whether Arc levels decline with age,
WT or Arc-Tg mice were killed at P30 or P180. Basal Arc ex-
pression in visual cortex is highly variable under standard hous-
ing conditions (21); therefore, we housed mice in the dark for
24 h and then either killed them immediately (“dark” condition)
or exposed them to light for 2 h (“light” condition) before eu-
thanasia (n = 6 per group) (22). The brain was fixed and sec-
tioned at 30 μm on a cryostat, and immunohistochemistry (IHC)
was performed for Arc protein using a custom-made Arc anti-
body (Fig. S2) on sections of brain containing primary visual
cortex. The integrated density of Arc-expressing cells in layer IV
of visual cortex, where VEPs and LTD were recorded, was measured
with the experimenter blinded to genotype and age (Fig. 2A). A
three-way ANOVA comparing genotype (WT or Arc-Tg), age
(P30 or P180), and condition (dark or light) revealed a main effect of
genotype (P < 0.0001), age (P = 0.02), and condition (P < 0.0001), as
well as a genotype × condition interaction (P = 0.02). Post hoc
Student’s t tests showed that in P30 mice, light significantly induced
Arc expression in both WT and Arc-Tg mice (WT: light > dark;
light: 4.5 ± 1.3, dark: 1 ± 0.6, P = 0.02; Arc-Tg: light > dark; light:
8.2 ± 1, dark: 2.7 ± 2.7, P = 0.002). However, Arc-Tg mice expressed
significantly more Arc after light exposure than WT mice (P =
0.008). At P180, WT mice no longer exhibited detectable Arc
expression, even after light exposure. Arc-Tg mice, on the other
hand, exhibited significant Arc expression after light exposure
(light: 7.1 ± 0.8, dark: 1.8 ± 1.2; P = 0.001). Furthermore, levels of
light-induced Arc in P180 Arc-Tg mice were not significantly dif-
ferent from P30 Arc-Tg mice (P > 0.05), suggesting that activity-
dependent expression of Arc in Arc-Tg mice does not decline with

 age. These data show that activity-dependent Arc protein expression
significantly declines with age in WT but not Arc-Tg mice. This loss
of endogenous Arc protein over age correlates with the decline of
deprived-eye depression following MD.
Arc transcription and translation are exquisitely regulated in the
brain and are finely tuned to experience and neuronal activity (12).
Of particular interest, transcription and translation of Arc can be
independently regulated by activity (23). We therefore sought to
determine whether endogenous activity-dependent Arc mRNA
expression also declines with age. Mice underwent dark and light
exposure as described above (n = 3–5 per group). The visual cortex
was dissected and qRT-PCR, the most sensitive and quantitative
method of RNA detection, was performed on lysates (Fig. 2B). A
three-way ANOVA revealed a main effect of genotype (P = 0.002)
and condition (P = 0.0002), but not age. Post hoc t tests showed
that light-induced Arc mRNA expression was higher in Arc-Tg
than WT mice (P30 WT: 2.9 ± 0.9, P30 Arc-Tg: 9.8 ± 1.6, P <
0.0001; P180 WT: 3.3 ± 0.7, P180 Arc-Tg: 16.7 ± 1.1, P < 0.0001).
Interestingly, however, levels of activity-induced Arc mRNA ex-
pression did not differ with age in either genotype (P > 0.05).
Although we cannot rule out the possibility that analysis of layer IV
alone would reveal an age effect, we note that Arc protein cannot
be detected in any layer of V1 in adult WT mice. These data
suggest that availability of endogenous Arc mRNA alone cannot
fully explain the differences in Arc protein expression across the
lifespan of WT mice and point to the possibility of a decrease in
either activity-dependent translation or stability of endogenous Arc
protein in adult visual cortex. Nevertheless, the increased expres-
sion of Arc mRNA in the active visual cortex of Arc-Tg mice is
paralleled by a proportional increase in protein.
Augmenting Arc Expression Restores LTD in Adult Visual Cortex.
Deprived-eye depression occurs via mechanisms shared with
LTD (3), which also diminishes with age (24). In addition to the
profound deficit in OD plasticity (11), juvenile (P20–25) Arc
knockout (KO) mice exhibit impaired layer IV LTD in visual
cortex, induced in slices with low-frequency stimulation (LFS) of
the white matter, compared with WT mice, which showed robust
LFS LTD (WT: n = 7 slices from four mice, 67.5 ± 5.7%; Arc
KO: n = 7 slices from five mice, 90.6 ± 4.6%; P < 0.001, t test;
Fig. 3A). We therefore hypothesized that the persistence of
juvenile OD plasticity in adult Arc-Tg mice was accompanied
(and perhaps accounted for) by continued expression of juvenile-
like LTD. To ensure expression of Arc protein in the slices, mice
were exposed briefly (30 min) to an enriched environment before
euthanasia as described previously (23). We first measured LTD
in juvenile mice when both WT and Arc-Tg animals show com-
parable OD plasticity, characterized by robust deprived-eye de-
pression after MD. Over the age range examined, between
P26 and P41, LTD in WT and Arc-Tg mice was also comparable
(WT: n = 9 slices from seven mice, 75.4 ± 11.6%; Arc-Tg: n = 7 slices
from six mice, 81.3 ± 7.1%; P > 0.5, t test; Fig. 3B). Subgroup analysis
of this juvenile cohort revealed no difference in LTD in animals of
either genotype at P26–33 or P34–41 (Fig. 3B, circles and inverted
triangles, respectively). However, in adult mice (P180–200), we ob-
served significant LTD in Arc-Tg slices but not in WT littermate
slices (WT: n = 11 slices from six mice, 102.8% ± 8.7; Arc-Tg: n =
12 slices from six mice, 74.5 ± 7.9%; Fig. 3C). The difference be-
tween genotypes was significant (P = 0.04, t test). Thus, augmented
expression of Arc in adult visual cortex restores or maintains two
features of juvenile plasticity: LTD in vitro (Fig. 3C) and deprived-
eye depression following MD in vivo (Fig. 1C).
Inhibition of Protein Synthesis in Vivo Impairs LTD in Juvenile Visual
Cortex. The apparent requirement of Arc translation for deprived-
eye depression may offer a partial explanation for why juvenile OD
plasticity following brief MD is impaired when the visual cortex is
infused locally with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide
(CHX) (25). If this explanation is correct, and the mechanisms of
LTD are used for deprived-eye depression following MD, we would
also expect to observe reduced LTD ex vivo following microinfusion
of CHX into visual cortex. To test this prediction, WT visual cortex
was infused in vivo via an osmotic minipump with CHX for 4 d as
described (25), and slices were then prepared to conduct LTD ex-
periments. Similar to our observations in the Arc KO visual cortex,
there was no LTD in juvenile visual cortex after chronic inhibition

Activity-dependent Arc protein, but not mRNA expression, declines
with age in WT mouse visual cortex, but not in Arc-Tg mice. (A) IHC for Arc
expression in layers I–IV of visual cortex after 24 h of being housed in the
dark or 24 h of dark housing followed by 2 h of light exposure. Layer IV Arc
expression is quantified in the graphs (n = 6 per group). Light increased Arc
expression in both WT and Arc-Tg mice at P30 (WT: *P = 0.02, Arc-Tg: *P =
0.002), but Arc levels were higher in Arc-Tg mice (#P = 0.008). At P180, WT
mice did not express Arc after light exposure, while Arc-Tg mice exhibited
the same light-induced increase in Arc observed at P30 (*P = 0.001). (Scale
bar: 100 μm.) (B) WT and Arc-Tg mice were dark-housed for 24 h and then
either killed in the dark (dark condition) or exposed to light for 2 h before
euthanasia (light condition). qRT-PCR was run on dissected visual cortex to
quantify Arc mRNA expression. All values were first normalized to GAPDH to
control for total RNA levels. Light-induced Arc mRNA expression was higher
in Arc-Tg mice than WT mice at both P30 and P180 (P30: *P < 0.0001, P180:
*P < 0.0001). However, light-induced mRNA expression did not decrease
with age in WT mice. Plotted data are normalized to P30 WT dark (n = 5 for
WT light, n = 4 for Arc-Tg light, and n = 3 for all dark groups). Data are
represented as mean ± SEM.

 of protein synthesis (saline: n = 5 slices from five mice, 72.4 ± 8.6%;
CHX: n = 7 slices from five mice, 96.2 ± 5.9%; P = 0.02, t test; Fig.
3D). Together, these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that
translation of Arc gates the mechanism of deprivation-induced
synaptic depression in visual cortex.
Acute Expression of Arc in Adult Mouse Visual Cortex Is Sufficient to
Reopen the Critical Period of Juvenile OD Plasticity. Augmenting the
availability of Arc protein throughout development and into
adulthood prolongs the critical period for juvenile OD plasticity
(Fig. 1). However, this does not address whether restoring Arc
protein expression is sufficient to reopen the critical period of
OD plasticity once it has closed. To determine whether acutely
increasing Arc protein in adult visual cortex is sufficient to re-
store juvenile-like plasticity, we expressed Arc using a lentivirus
injected into visual cortex of P180 WT mice, which robustly in-
creased Arc levels (Fig. 4A and Fig. S3). Lentivirus containing
GFP-Arc or GFP was injected into layer IV of visual cortex, and
baseline VEP recordings were conducted 1 wk after virus injection.
Unlike the case in Arc-Tg mice, viral Arc overexpression is consti-
tutively driven and not activity-dependent. Based on previous studies
(26, 27), we predicted that VEP amplitude might be depressed by
constitutive Arc expression since the VEP is mainly a synaptic pop-
ulation response that correlates with surface AMPA receptor ex-
pression (11). Indeed, a significant decrease in overall binocular VEP
amplitude was observed compared with GFP-injected mice (GFP-
injected mice: 197 ± 30 μV, GFP-Arc–injected mice: 75 ± 21 μV;
P = 0.005; Fig. 4B). No deprived-eye depression was observed in
GFP-injected mice following short (3–4 d) MD (GFP: normalized to
baseline contra values: n = 11; contra baseline = 1 ± 0.2, post-MD =
0.9 ± 0.2; P = 0.4, paired t test; Fig. 4C). However, despite a re-
duction in baseline VEP magnitude, contra VEP responses were
further reduced after MD in GFP-Arc–injected mice (GFP-Arc:
normalized to baseline contra values: n = 5, contra baseline = 1 ±
0.2, post-MD = 0.6 ± 0.2; P = 0.02; Fig. 4D). Further, when com-
paring the fractional change in contra eye and ipsi eye visual re-
sponses following MD, there was a significant difference between
GFP- vs. GFP-Arc–injected mice (GFP: contra depression = 0.9 ±
0.1, ipsi potentiation = 1.4 ± 0.1; GFP-Arc: contra depression = 0.5 ±
0.1, ipsi potentiation = 1.0 ± 0.1; P = 0.01, MANOVA; Fig. 4E).
Critically, the fractional OD shift in the P180 GFP-injected mice was
the same as in noninjected WT P180 mice (P = 0.3, MANOVA),
indicating virus injection had no effect on cortical responses or OD
plasticity. Additionally, the fractional OD shift in P180 WT mice
injected with GFP-Arc did not significantly differ from age-matched
Arc-Tg mice, indicating that acute viral expression of Arc can restore
OD plasticity to a degree similar to that achieved by Tg augmenta-
tion of Arc throughout life (P = 0.6, MANOVA; Fig. 4E). In-
triguingly, not only was contra eye depression observed in Arc-Tg and
GFP-Arc–injected mice but a lack of ipsi eye potentiation was also
observed, further suggesting that Arc protein levels control the
qualitative aspects of OD plasticity.
These data show that acutely increasing Arc protein expres-
sion in visual cortex is sufficient to restore juvenile OD plasticity

Arc and protein translation are required for LTD in layer IV of visual cortex. (A) LFS (900 stimuli at 1 Hz) induces robust LTD in juvenile (P20–25) WT,
but not Arc-KO, slices (average of last 5 min of recordings normalized to the baseline; WT: n = 4 mice, KO: n = 5; *P < 0.001). (B) LFS induces LTD to the same
degree in young (P26–41) WT and Arc-Tg slices (WT: n = 7, Arc-Tg: n = 6; P > 0.5). The LTD amplitudes of field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) of the
youngest animals in this group (P26–33, circles) and the older animals (P34–41, inverted triangles) do not show any significant difference (P > 0.5, t test), and
were therefore combined. (C) LFS induces robust LTD in adult (P180–200) Arc-Tg slices, but not WT slices (WT: n = 11, Arc-Tg: n = 6; *P = 0.04). (D) LFS induced
LTD in juvenile (P25–30) visual cortex previously infused with saline, but not in visual cortex infused with CHX (saline: n = 5, CHX: n = 5; *P = 0.02). Data are
represented as mean ± SEM.

 in adult visual cortex, suggesting the increased availability of Arc
protein is sufficient to allow deprivation-induced synaptic de-
pression in adult visual cortex.
Discussion
Here, we show that acute or chronic up-regulation of Arc protein
in adult mice renders visual cortical synapses sensitive to deprived-
eye depression following MD, recapitulating juvenile critical pe-
riod OD plasticity. In agreement with the prevailing hypothesis
that LTD mechanisms mediate deprived-eye depression (3),
overexpression of Arc also prolongs juvenile-like LTD in adult
visual cortex. Conversely, elimination of Arc expression or in-
hibition of mRNA translation in juvenile visual cortex prevents
deprived-eye depression after MD in vivo (11, 25) and LTD ex
vivo. Together, these data indicate that availability of Arc is crit-
ical for the expression of juvenile plasticity in visual cortex.
Considering the key role for Arc in determining the qualities
of OD plasticity in visual cortex of juvenile animals, we predicted
that the loss of deprived-eye depression after MD in adult visual
cortex correlates with a lack of activity-dependent Arc expres-
sion. Indeed, we found that endogenous Arc protein expression
in the active visual cortex declines with age, coincident with the
loss of juvenile plasticity. Surprisingly, however, we found that
activity-dependent Arc mRNA expression is comparable in juv-
enile (∼P30) and adult (∼P180) WT mouse visual cortex. This
finding implies that the normal decline in Arc protein expression
in active visual cortex results from a decrease in experience-
dependent Arc translation, which can occur via mechanisms
that are distinct from those regulating activity-dependent tran-
scription (12, 23). The lack of decline in activity-dependent Arc
expression in Arc-Tg mice could be due to the increase in Arc
mRNA levels. Alternatively or in addition, the extra Arc allele in
the Arc-Tg line does not contain an intron in the 3′ UTR region,
which may result in an increase in mRNA stability in dendrites
due to a lack of nonsense-mediated decay (28), and would thus
potentially have a longer half-life than endogenous Arc mRNA.
Restoration of juvenile plasticity in adult mice injected with GFP-Arc
suggests that the presence of Arc protein in visual cortex is sufficient
for juvenile OD plasticity.
Deprived-eye depression after MD is believed to occur via
mechanisms revealed by the study of LTD in layer IV. LTD in
this layer is triggered by NMDA receptor activation and
expressed by internalization of AMPA receptors (29). Although
NMDA receptor-dependent LTD is not affected by acute
(in vitro) inhibition of protein synthesis (30), we discovered that
chronic inhibition of protein synthesis by in vivo microinfusion of
CHX, which has been shown to prevent deprived-eye depression
(25), impairs layer IV LTD ex vivo. These findings are reminis-
cent of the recent observation that chronic, but not acute, in-
hibition of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) can
disrupt both deprived-eye depression after MD and LTD in layer
IV (19). Activity-dependent synthesis of Arc protein occurs down-
stream of mGluR5 activation (12, 23). Thus, a simple explanation
for this constellation of findings is that NMDA receptor-dependent
LTD and deprived-eye depression require Arc protein as a necessary
cofactor, and are inhibited by chronic block of either mGluR5 or
protein synthesis. Decreased availability of Arc, and a consequent
down-regulation of the mechanisms of LTD, also offers a simple
molecular explanation for the age-dependent loss of synaptic sensi-
tivity to visual deprivation.
Inhibition develops later than excitatory transmission in the
cortex, and it has been suggested that the consequent decrease in
the ratio of excitation to inhibition brings the critical period for
juvenile plasticity to a close (10). We propose that decreasing the
excitability of the visual cortex ultimately affects OD plasticity by
preventing the activity-dependent expression of key activity-
regulated plasticity proteins at the synapse that are important
mediators of excitatory synaptic modification, such as Arc (Fig. S4).

Acute Arc expression in adult mouse visual cortex is sufficient to
restore juvenile OD plasticity. P180 WT mice were injected unilaterally in
the visual cortex with lentivirus expressing either GFP alone or GFP-Arc.
(A) Representative image of virally driven GFP expression in binocular
visual cortex and time line of the experiment. The white dashed lines de-
marcate the cortical layers, as well as the position of the tip of the recording
electrode. (B) GFP- and GFP-Arc–injected P180 mice were visually stimulated
before MD with both eyes open to record binocular baseline VEPs. GFP-Arc–
injected mice had significantly smaller VEPs than GFP-injected mice (GFP: n =
11, GFP-Arc: n = 5; *P = 0.005). Traces represent average VEPs for GFP- and
GFP-Arc–injected mice. (C) Data were normalized to baseline contra values.
There was no significant change in contra VEP amplitudes following MD in
GFP-injected animals (P > 0.05); however, there was a significant ipsi increase
(*P = 0.003). (D) Data were normalized to baseline contra values. GFP-Arc–
injected mice exhibited significant contra depression following MD (*P =
0.016) and no change in ipsi responses. Averaged VEP traces are presented
above the graphs. (E) Plot of the fractional change in ipsi (x axis) and contra
(y axis) eye VEPs following MD (same data as in C and D, noninjected WT and
Arc-Tg data are from Fig. 1B). There is a significant difference between the
fractional change in visual responses between GFP- and GFP-Arc–injected
mice (P < 0.01). GFP-injected mice exhibit the same lack of change as non-
injected P180 WT mice (P = 0.3), while GFP-Arc–injected mice exhibit the
same degree of change as noninjected P180 Arc-Tg mice (P = 0.6). Data are
represented as mean ± SEM.

 Indeed, in addition to manipulations of inhibition, OD plasticity
can be restored in adult rodents exposed to an enriched visual
environment (6, 7), treated chronically with fluoxetine (8), or
genetically engineered to express constitutively active CREB
(31), manipulations that also increase Arc protein levels (32).
The precise regulation of Arc expression during development
therefore provides a potential mechanistic link between the
maturation of inhibition and changes in the qualities of excit-
atory synaptic modification over the lifespan.
Materials and Methods
Animals. Tg mouse lines harboring the Arc-promoter mCherry-Arc transgene
(mCherry-Arc/Arc) were generated as previously described (18). Further de-
tails can be found in SI Materials and Methods. Requests for mice should be
directly addressed to H.B. or H.O. Arc KO mice were obtained from Kuan
Wang, NIH, Bethesda, and were previously described (22). Both male and
female mice were used, and the experimenter was blinded to genotype in all
experiments. Male C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories) at the age of
P22–25 were used for the Alzet pump implantation experiments. Male
C57BL/6 mice (The Jackson Laboratory) at the age of P180 were used for
lentiviral VEP experiments. All procedures were approved by the In-
stitutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, the University of Utah, and The University of Tokyo Graduate
School of Medicine, in conjunction with NIH guidelines.
Virus Production/Injection.
Virus production. Kimberly Huber, University of Texas Southwestern Medical
Center, Dallas, generously donated FUGW lentiviral plasmids for ubiquitin
(Ubq)-GFP and Ubq-GFP-Arc. Injections were carried out as previously de-
scribed (33).
VEP recordings, slice electrophysiology, and IHC. VEP recordings, slice electro-
physiology, and IHC were carried out as previously described (11, 19). De-
tailed methods on IHC, qRT-PCR, VEP recordings, and slice electrophysiology
can be found in SI Materials and Methods.
Statistics. ANOVA/MANOVA tests and post hoc Student’s t tests were per-
formed using JMP Pro software (v12; SAS Institute). For slice electrophysi-
ology experiments, post hoc paired t tests were performed to determine the
significance of changes before and after LFS and unpaired t tests were
performed to test the differences between groups after LFS.
