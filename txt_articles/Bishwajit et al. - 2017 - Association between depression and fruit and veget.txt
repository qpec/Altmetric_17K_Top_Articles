Abstract
Background: In recent years there has been a growing research interest regarding the impact of dietary behaviour
on mental health outcomes. The present study aimed to investigate the association between fruit and vegetable
(F&V) consumption and depression in three south Asian countries- Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
Methods: Cross-sectional data were obtained from World Health Survey of WHO conducted during 2002–04. In
total 14,133 adult subjects (Bangladesh 3262, India 7594, Nepal 3277) aged 18 years and above were included in
the study. Outcome variables were Self-Reported Depression (SRD) during last 30 days and 12 months. Multivariable
regression methods were used to explore the association between F&V consumption and depression.
Results: Prevalence of Self-Reported Depression during past 12 months were respectively 39%, 17.7%, and 49.9% for
Bangladesh, India and Nepal. In India, those who consumed less than five servings of vegetables were respectively 41%
[AOR = 1.41; 95%CI = 0.60-3.33] and 57% [AOR = 1.57; 95%CI = 0.93-2.64] more likely to report severe-extreme
and mild-moderate depression during past 30 days compared to those who consumed five servings a day.
Regarding fruit consumption, compared to those who consumed five servings a day, the odds of severe-extreme and
mild-moderate SRD were respectively 3.5 times [AOR = 3.48; 95%CI = 1.216-10.01] and 45% [AOR = 1.44; 95%CI = 0.89-2.
32] higher in Bangladesh, and 2.9 times [AOR = 2.92; 95%CI = 1.12-7.64] and 42% higher [AOR = 1.41; 95%CI = 0.89-2.24]
in Nepal compared to those who consumed less than five servings a day during last 30 days.
Conclusion: Daily intake of less than five servings of F&V was associated with higher odds of depression. Nutrition
programs aimed at promoting F&V consumption might prove beneficial to reduce the prevalence of depression in
south Asian population. Further studies are required to understand the factors limiting the adequate consumption of
F&V.

Background
Depression represents a major public health concern
worldwide and it is often referred as the common cold in
the field of psychiatry. This analogy may provide a good
understanding of the frequency of occurrence, however its
significance goes far deeper with repercussions on aca-
demic and professional performance, Quality of Life
(QoL), familial and Social Well Being (SWB). Global
Burden of Disease (GBD) 2010 Study reported a global
prevalence of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) of 4.7%
(4.4–5.0%) with an incidence of 3.0% (2.4–3.8%) [1].
Moussavi et al. reported a lifetime prevalence of depres-
sion of 15 to 20% globally [2]. Another Global Burden of
Disease (GBD) 2010 study reported that MDD ranked
11th among the leading causes of Disability Adjusted Life
Years (DALYs) worldwide in 2010, a 37% increase since
1990 (15th in 1990) [3]. Worldwide, about 25% of individ-
uals develop one or more mental or behavioral disorders
during their lifetime [4]. In 2002, depression was the third
leading cause of disease burden (equivalent to 4.3% of all
DALYs),
and
also
the
leading
cause
of
disability

 responsible for 13.4% of Years Lived with Disability
(YLDs) in women and 8.3% in men [5]. According to the
World Health Organization, depression is projected to be
a leading cause of disability worldwide by 2020, second
only to ischemic health disease [6].
There is a growing volume of research dedicated to
investigating the epidemiology and rising prevalence of
depression, the risk factors, and devising preventive and
intervention
measures.
Some
have
attributed
the
increasing prevalence to the changing lifestyle brought
by modernity and to the depressiogenic/stressogenic
environment it has brought along e.g. dietary changes,
urbanization, social inequality and isolation, loneliness,
sedentary lifestyle, sleep-deprivation [7–9]. Certain life-
style related issues and adoption of unhealthy behaviours
function as contributing factors to poor physical health
outcomes and give rise to higher incidence of psycho-
logical disorders [7–10]. Pharmacological treatments of
depressive
disorders
have
experienced
remarkable
progress over the course of past 4–5 decades and consti-
tutes to be the main therapeutic approach for depres-
sion. However, non-pharmacological management (e.g.
dietary behaviour, physical activity) of psychological dis-
orders are also gaining increasing attention. For instance,
there has been a renewed interest in the potential role of
dietary management such as fruit and vegetables con-
sumption in preventing Non-communicable Chronic
Disease (NCDs) including mental illnesses [11, 12].
According to some estimates, inadequate fruit consump-
tion is the most prominent dietary risk factor for global
disease burden and responsible for about 4.9 million
(95% CI 3.8–5.9) deaths and 4.2% (95% CI 3.3–5.0) of
global DALYs [13].
Fruits and vegetables are regarded as essential compo-
nents of a healthy diet for their low energy content and
rich sources of micronutrients, fiber, and other large
number of bioactive compounds with potential effect on
brain and overall health [14]. One widely accepted
mechanism for higher fruits and vegetables consumption
on better mental health is that antioxidants defend
against the negative effects of oxidative stress, which is
associated with depression [15, 16]. Moreover, antioxi-
dants are shown to have beneficial effects on inflamma-
tory markers which are associated with elevated levels of
depression [17]. Regular consumption of fruits and vege-
tables can help body fight against the causative agents
and cope up with depressive syndromes. Dietary guide-
lines by WHO/FAO recommends a minimum of 5 serv-
ings (400 g) of F&V/day that provides a reasonable
amount of micronutrients which may contribute to
favorable cardiometabolic outcomes [18]. However, in
many Low and Middle-Income Counties (LMICs) the
level of F&V intake is far lower than this level. In South
Asia for instance, F&V intake among adults in India and
Pakistan was reported at about 100 g per capita per day
or less, compared to 300 g in Europe and the USA [19].
Country level data on F&V consumption are not avail-
able, however different sources suggest that average
number of vegetable servings on the days when vege-
table was consumed were of 3–3.4 servings in Matlab,
and 1.3-1.5 servings in Vadu, India [19]. A multi-country
study reported 74% lower than recommended level of
F&V consumption among adult population in India [20].
Though several researches have provided evidence on
the role of F&V consumption in the prevention of
chronic diseases on South Asian population, there is no
study so far conducted in the context of psychological
disorders.
With
an
aim
to
address
this
gap,
we
conducted this study exploring the association between
the frequency of F&V consumption and Self-Reported
Depression. It should be noted that data on dietary
pattern and mental illness are very limited in this region.
We utilised datasets from the World Health Survey
(2002–04) which is the first to provide country represen-
tative data on these indicators in South Asia.
Methods
The survey
This study is based on data extracted from World
Health Survey of WHO conducted between 2002 and
2004 which are available from WHO upon request. The
program is operational in 70 countries including four
south Asian nations namely Bangladesh, India, Nepal
and Sri Lanka. Objectives of the WHO funded survey
were to provide reliable, nationally comparable data on a
wide range of health and socioeconomic indicators that
are necessary for monitoring performance and respon-
siveness of health systems progress towards public
health related goals [21]. The target population were
randomly selected male and female adults aged 18 years
or over residing in non-institutional settings (e.g. exclud-
ing military reservations, or other non-household living
arrangements). For those who were in a health institu-
tion (e.g. hospital, hospice, nursing home, home for the
aged, etc.) at the time of household visit, interview was
conducted either in the institution or upon their return
to their household if within a period of two weeks from
the first visit to the household.
The interviews were done face-to-face in the local lan-
guage using pencil and paper questionnaires. Each inter-
view lasted for approximately sixty minutes depending on
the comprehension and literacy level of the respondent.
Interviews were conducted by qualified personnel familiar
with the local culture, customs and the language. Multi-
stage cluster sampling method was employed to include
eligible individuals and the number of individuals selected
were 5924 for Bangladesh (response rate 94%), 9977 for
India (response rate 97%), 8818 for Nepal (response rate

 98%), 6759 for Sri Lanka (response rate 99%). Further
details regarding the survey methods are available
elsewhere [22].
Outcome
Self-Reported
Depression
(SRD)
status
during
last
30 days and 12 months were the outcome variable in
this study.
Respondents were asked- During the last 12 months,
have you had a period lasting several days when you felt
sad, empty or depressed. Self-reported response categor-
ies to these question was- 1. Yes, 2. No.
For short term depression, the question was- Overall in
the last 30 days, how much of a problem did you have
with feeling sad, low or depressed? Possible answers to
this question were: 1. None 2. Mild 3. Moderate 4. Severe,
and 5. Extreme. For regression analysis, the categories
were collapsed into three: Not depressed, Mild-Moderate
Depression, and Severe-Extreme Depression.
The explanatory variable of primary interest was fruit
and vegetable consumption. Respondents were asked:
How many servings of fruit do you eat on a typical day?
Answer ranged from 0 to 14 servings a day. As per
WHO/FAO recommendation, the cut-off of at least five
servings of F&V a day was used, and the following cat-
egorisation was used: <5 servings a day/5 servings a day
every day/>5 servings a day.
Based on literature review and availability on the datasets,
the other explanatory variables included in the study were-
Age: 18-29/30-39/40-49/50-59/60+ years; Sex: Female/
Male; Currently married: No/Yes; Educational attainment:
Nil/Less than primary school/Primary complete/Secondary

Smoking
habit:
Daily/Yes but not daily/Non-smoker; Ever drank alcohol:
Yes/No, Satisfaction with health: Very dissatisfied/Dis-
satisfied/Neither

Very Satisfied.
Statistical analysis
Datasets were checked for missing values, outliers and
were weighted to ensure the results are representative of
the population. Variables were also categorised before
analysis. Sample characteristics were analysed through
simple descriptive statistics e.g. frequencies and percent-
ages. Cross tabulation was performed to measure the
distribution of the sociodemographic variables across
the outcome variable and crude prevalence of depres-
sion. Significance of group differences (depressed Vs not
depressed) for the explanatory variables were tested by
chi-square tests and was presented as p-values. Final
step was regression analysis that assessed the adjusted
associations between depression and F&V consumption.

 Only the variables that had a p-value below 0.025 in the
cross-tabs were selected for the regression analysis [23].
Three separate regression models were run for each
country. The outcomes of the regression analysis were
reported in terms of adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and
corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Analyses were
performed with SPSS version 21 and Stata version 12.
Results
Basic socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of
the study population are presented in Table 1. Among
all three countries, Nepal had the highest mean age
(42.65 years, SD 16.58) and India had lowest (39.11, SD
15.32). Majority of the sample population for all the
countries were aged below 30 years and were female.
Rate of being currently married was respectively 57.2%,
76.8% and 80.8% for Bangladesh, India and Nepal. Liter-
acy rate was highest for highest for India (41.4%) and
lowest for Nepal (31.1%). Unemployment rate was
respectively 54.9%, 45.7% and 33.1% for Bangladesh,
India and Nepal, and majority of the participants were
self-employed. Tobacco smoking was more prevalent
than alcohol drinking in all three countries- Bangladesh
(45.8 Vs 6.5%), India (34.3 Vs 10.5%), Nepal (45.5 Vs
36.1%). Rate of satisfaction (satisfied and very satisfied)
with health was respectively 42.7%, 56.6%, 41.9% for
Bangladesh, India and Nepal. Rate of adequate amount
of fruit and vegetable consumption was very low for all
three countries. Percentage of sample population con-
suming 5/5+ servings of fruits was respectively 5.1% for
both Bangladesh, India and 8.6% for Nepal, and that for
vegetable consumption was respectively 13.8%, 5.6%, and
2.7% for Bangladesh, India and Nepal.

 prevalent among the younger age groups, female, cur-
rently unmarried, having no formal education, having no
employment, smoking tobacco and drinking alcohol.
Those who reported being very satisfied with health and
consuming 5 or 5+ servings of fruits and vegetables were
less likely to report suffering from depression.
Prevalence of SRD in past 30 days was shown in
table 3. Nepal had the highest prevalence of severe to
extreme SRD (17.2%) and India had the lowest (11.9%).
Mild

(33.3%). Similar to SRD during past 12 months, that
during past 30 days were more prevalent among those
were elderly, female, currently unmarried, had no formal
education and employment, smoked tobacco, drank
alcohol and less prevalent among those who reported
satisfaction with health and consuming 5/5+ servings of
fruits and vegetables every day.
Association between fruit and vegetable consumption
and SRD
Results of multivariable regression analysis for the associ-
ation between frequency of fruit and vegetable consump-
tion during past 12 months and 30 days with SRD were
shown in Tables 4 and 5. Results indicate that compared
to those who consumed five servings of vegetables per
day, those who consumed less than five servings had 51%
[AOR = 1.51; 95%CI = 0.82-2.76] higher odds of reporting
depression during past 12 months in India. In Bangladesh,
consuming
more
than
five
servings
of
vegetables
decreased the odds of SDR by 32% [AOR = 0.67; 95%CI =
0.44-1.03]. Compared to those who consumed five serv-
ings of fruits per day, the odds of SDR were respectively
86% and 3.1 times higher in Bangladesh and India among
those who consumed less than five servings.
In India, those who consumed less than five servings
of vegetables were respectively 41% [AOR = 1.41; 95%CI
= 0.60-3.33] and 57% [AOR = 1.57; 95%CI = 0.93-2.64]
more likely to report severe-extreme and mild-moderate
depression during past 30 days compared to those who
consumed five servings a day.
Regarding fruit consumption, compared to those who
consumed five servings a day, the odds of severe-
extreme and mild-moderate SDR were respectively 3.5
times [AOR = 3.48; 95%CI = 1.21-10.01] and 45% [AOR
= 1.44; 95%CI = 0.89-2.32] higher in Bangladesh, and 2.9
times [AOR = 2.92; 95%CI = 1.12-7.64] and 42% higher
[AOR = 1.41; 95%CI = 0.89-2.24] in Nepal among those
who consumed less than five servings a day during last
30 days.

 Discussion
Findings indicate that Nepal had the highest rate of SRD
both in the past 12 months and 30 days followed by
Bangladesh and India. However, prevalence of mild-
moderate depression was highest in Bangladesh as more
than two-fifth participants reported being depressed dur-
ing past 30 days compared to about one-third in Nepal.
India had the lowest prevalence of depression of any
duration. Explanations for this variation is not within
the scope of the present study, however the lowest
prevalence of depression among Indians could partly be
due their better living standard (In terms of HDI)
compared to most other south Asian nations. Material
standard of living were reported to be associated with
poor physical and mental health outcomes [21].
Prevalence of adequate amount (five servings per day)
of fruits and vegetable consumption were remarkably
low in all three countries. Fruit consumption at five
servings/day was highest in India flowed by Nepal and
Bangladesh. This could be due the fact that fruit is used
as an essential component in traditional festivals and
rituals practised by the Hindu communities across India
and Nepal. Surprisingly, vegetable consumption (five
servings/day) was lowest in India. Despite being a largely
vegetarian country and being among the highest F&V
producing nation, F&V account for less than one-tenth
of total caloric intake among Indians [24]. This is mainly
due to higher dependence on cereal diets, and availabil-
ity issues due to poor preservation and supply chain
infrastructure. Low F&V consumption may also be due
to the dietary transition and rapid urbanization these
countries are experiencing [22]. Over the past two de-
cades, South Asian food intake patterns and dietary com-
position have undergone remarkable changes marked by a
shift from a traditional cereal- and vegetable-based and
low-meat diet to a high animal-based and low fruits- and
vegetable- based diet [22]. In Bangladesh, consumption of
F&V is currently 20% below the recommended daily intake
[25]. In a Nepal, different studies have reported that about
66 to 99.2% of the population were not consuming recom-
mended level of F&V [26, 27].
Consistent with previous researches, F&V intake was
associated with higher prevalence of SRD in our analysis.
Though data are not available for south Asian countries,
evidence from developed countries indicate a positive
dose—response relationship between F&V consumption
with the risk of depression [28–30]. Among Swiss adults,
consuming five servings of F&V a day was associated
with lower odds of being highly or moderately distressed
than consuming less than that [28]. Cross-sectional
studies in the US and Canada also reported positive
association between high fruit and vegetable consump-
tion and lower mental distress [29, 30]. A recent meta-
analysis on ten studies indicated that F&V consumption
was inversely associated with the risk of depression [31].
Strengths and limitations
To our knowledge, this is the first study to focus on F&V
consumption and depression in South Asian population.
Sample size was reasonably good for all three countries
and was representative of the population. Therefore, the
findings serve equally usefully to both policy makers and
public health and nutrition researchers. As both short-
terms and long-term depression were included, the find-
ings produced a clearer picture on the magnitude of
depression. Using the standard cut-off of five servings a
day provides an internationally comparable prevalence of
F&V consumption in the population. Despite these contri-
butions, there are some important limitations that need to
be considered to interpret the findings. As the survey was
cross-sectional in nature, it does not allow making any
causal inference of the associations. Also, since the direc-
tion of the association is not possible to know, low intake
of F&V among subjects with depression could also be a
result of reduced appetite. Last but not least, information
on F&V intake and depression were self-reported, hence

recall error.
Conclusion
In conclusion, prevalence of depression was high in all
countries and was more prevalent among subjects who
reported less than adequate level of F&V intake. An alarm-
ingly large proportion of sample population did not adhere
to the recommended amount of F&V consumption.
Although the basic therapeutic approach for depression is
pharmacological treatment, many clinical psychiatrists
consider non-pharmacological approaches as an essential
component of treatment. Non-pharmacological interven-
tions such as dietary modification by encouraging higher
consumption of F&V should be given more programmatic
attention. The widespread production of F&V offers the
opportunity for mass intervention of depression. In order
to promote F&V consumption at national level, nutrition
education and dietary behaviour changing programs can be
integrated with community health projects. Addressing the
barriers to access to F&V should also be taken into consid-
eration in national food and nutrition security agenda.
More in-depth studies are required to understand the bar-
riers to and behavioral factors associated with F&V
consumption.
