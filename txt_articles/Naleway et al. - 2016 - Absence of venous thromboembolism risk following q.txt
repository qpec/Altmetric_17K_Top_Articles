Abstract
Background—To investigate concerns about a potential association between quadrivalent 
human papillomavirus vaccination (HPV4) and venous thromboembolism (VTE), we conducted a 
self-controlled case series study in adolescents and young adults 9–26 years of age in the Vaccine 
Safety Datalink.
Methods—We identified potential VTE cases diagnosed in 2008 through 2011 who had also 
received at least one HPV4 dose during that period. We confirmed each presumptive diagnosis by 
medical record review. We calculated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals 
(CI) to estimate the risk in the 1–60 day period following HPV4 exposure and in subsets of that 
period. IRRs were stratified by age, gender, hormonal contraceptive use, and recent surgery or 
trauma.

 Results—We identified 313 potential cases of VTE among HPV4 vaccinees, and 291 (93%) had 
sufficient medical records for review. Of these, we confirmed 156 (54%) cases. VTE was 
uncommon among males (n = 3) and 9–12 year olds (n = 4). Nearly all confirmed cases (97%) had 
at least one known risk factor for VTE, including hormonal contraceptive use, obesity, and 
hypercoagulability. Sixteen (10%) confirmed cases occurred in the 1–60 days following HPV4 
exposure. The risk of VTE varied from 1.47 (95% CI: 0.47–4.64) in the 1–7 days following HPV4 
exposure to 0.92 (95% CI: 0.54–1.57) in the 1–60 days following vaccination. It was not possible 
to calculate a stratified IRR for males due to small sample size; the other risk factors evaluated did 
not significantly affect the risk of VTE after HPV4 exposure.
Conclusion—The risk of developing VTE among 9- to 26-year-olds was not elevated following 
HPV4 exposure. Sample size limited our ability to rigorously evaluate potential effect modifiers, 
such as gender, through stratified analysis.

1. Introduction
Two post-licensure monitoring studies from the United States have reported a potential 
association between quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccination (HPV4) and venous 
thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary 
embolism (PE). An increased rate of VTE reporting with HPV4 vaccination (0.2 per 
100,000 HPV4 doses distributed) compared to other adolescent vaccines was observed in the 
U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System [1], and an elevated risk of VTE (relative 
risk (RR) = 1.98) was noted in the 1–7 days following HPV4 vaccination among females 9–
17 years old in the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) [2]. The number of cases included in 
these U.S. studies was small, and cases had multiple known risk factors for VTE, primarily 
oral contraceptive use.
In contrast to these early observations, later studies from North America and Scandinavia 
have reported no increased risk of VTE following HPV4 vaccination in young women [3–6]. 
No VTE was reported among 12–15 year old Canadian girls, and no increased risk of VTE 
was observed in a cohort of 9–26 year old females in California [3,5]. Using national 
registry data from Denmark and Sweden, Arnheim-Dahlstrom et al. reported a RR of 0.86 in 
the 90-day exposure period following vaccination in a cohort of females 10–17 years old, 
and Scheller et al. reported a RR of 0.77 in the 42 days after exposure among Danish 
females 10–44 years old using a self-controlled case series design [4,6]. An important 
limitation of these studies was they did not review medical records to confirm VTE 
diagnoses, which may have resulted in misclassification of case status and onset date. 
Moreover, none of the studies to date have included males, although HPV4 has been 
licensed for males in the United States since October 2009 [7].
The primary objective of our study was to assess the risk of confirmed VTE following 
HPV4 exposure in a large population-based cohort of female and male adolescents and

 young adults in the VSD. Our secondary objective was to identify potential effect 
modification between known VTE risk factors and HPV4 exposure in this population.
2. Methods
The VSD is a collaboration between nine integrated healthcare delivery systems (“sites”) 
and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [8]. Each site creates annual 
study data files using available electronic medical records and administrative databases. The 
files contain information about member demographics and health plan enrollment, 
diagnoses, procedures, and immunizations.
We used these VSD datasets to conduct a self-controlled case series analysis of VTE risk 
following HPV vaccination among adolescents and young adults 9–26 years of age, the ages 
for which the vaccine is licensed. The self-controlled case series method involves 
identifying cases, dividing each case's observation time into pre-defined exposed and 
unexposed periods based on dates of vaccination, and calculating the incidence rate ratio 
(IRR) using these periods [9].
2.1. Case ascertainment and validation
We identified potential cases of VTE (DVT and PE) defined as persons with an ICD-9 
diagnosis code of 415.1x (pulmonary embolism), 451.1x (phlebitis and thrombophlebitis of 
deep vessels of lower extremities), or 453.x (deep vein thrombosis and thrombophlebitis) 
assigned to outpatient, inpatient, and emergency room encounters from January 1, 2008 
through December 31, 2011 at six VSD sites (Kaiser Permanente Northwest, Group Health, 
Kaiser Permanente Colorado, Kaiser Permanente Southern California, Kaiser Permanente 
Northern California, and Marshfield Clinic). We limited potential cases to those who did not 
have a VTE diagnosis assigned between 2001 and 2007 in order to focus on incident cases 
and exclude follow-up care for VTE or recurrent diagnoses. We further limited potential 
cases to those who had received at least one HPV4 dose during the 2008–2011 study period, 
and were enrolled in the health plan at the time of both VTE symptom onset and 
vaccination.
Trained medical records abstractors manually reviewed the electronic medical record for all 
selected potential cases to confirm the incident VTE diagnosis, estimate the date of onset of 
VTE symptoms, and collect additional information on known VTE risk factors. Reviewers 
were blinded to the vaccination status and date of the potential case. We used the abstracted 
information to further classify cases into four groups based on criteria used in other 
epidemiologic studies of VTE: definite, probable, possible, and not VTE (Table 1) [10]. 
Radiologic confirmation was required to meet the definition of a definite DVT or PE case. 
Complicated cases were reviewed and adjudicated by consensus by a committee of 
physician study investigators (T.H., C.V., N.K., L.J.).
2.2. Exposure and risk factor ascertainment
We extracted dose number and administration date for all HPV4 doses received during the 
study period from the study data files. We manually abstracted information about known 
risk factors for VTE from the electronic medical records, including pneumonia, cancer, or

 hypercoagulability (e.g., Factor V Leiden, Protein S deficiency); pregnancy, surgery, 
trauma, international or long-distance travel, and long-term care facility residence within 60 
days prior to VTE diagnosis; hormonal contraceptive use; smoking status; family history of 
VTE; and presence of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) or central venous 
catheter (CVC) [11–15]. Abstracted height and weight were used to calculate body mass 
index (BMI), which was categorized as underweight or normal (<25.0 m/kg2), overweight 
(25.0–29.9 m/kg2), or obese (≥30.0 m/kg2). We also extracted additional pregnancy 
information from the VSD data files, including pregnancy dates and outcomes, using a 
previously validated algorithm [16].
2.3. Analysis
Our analysis included only chart-confirmed cases (definite, probable, and possible VTE) 
who were vaccinated during the study period (2008–2011). Observation time began January 
1, 2008 or the case's first health plan enrollment date thereafter. Observation time was 
terminated at the end of the study period (December 31, 2011) or health plan disenrollment, 
whichever occurred first. We then divided this observation time into exposure periods (1–7, 
1–14, 1–28, 1–42, and 1–60 days following HPV4 vaccination); all other observation time 
was considered unexposed. We selected the 1–60 day exposure period to encompass the 
theoretical period during which inflammatory or coagulation pathways may be activated 
following an exposure and result in medically recognized VTE.
Using the date of VTE symptom onset, we calculated IRRs and 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) with conditional Poisson regression to compare the incidence of VTE in HPV4 
exposed periods to the incidence in unexposed periods. We decided a priori to calculate age- 
and gender-stratified IRRs, and to calculate IRRs stratified by exposure to hormonal 
contraceptives at the time of VTE diagnosis, assuming that these might be important effect 
modifiers. We also calculated IRRs stratified by exposure to surgery or trauma within the 60 
days preceding VTE diagnosis.
Institutional Review Boards at each participating site and the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention reviewed and approved the study protocol and abstraction form.
3. Results
3.1. Case ascertainment and validation
During the study period, there were about 1.24 million doses of HPV4 administered to 
650,737 persons 9–26 years of age enrolled in the VSD. We identified 313 persons with a 
diagnosis of VTE who had received at least one HPV4 dose during the study period (Fig. 1). 
Of these, 291 (93%) had sufficient medical records for review. After medical record review, 
156 (54%) of the cases reviewed met the VTE definition, 121 (42%) did not meet the 
definition, and 14 (5%) required further review and adjudication. We confirmed 161 cases of 
VTE, including 87 DVT cases, 58 PE cases, and 16 cases with both DVT and PE. Among 
the 130 potential cases that were not confirmed, reasons for exclusion were miscoded or 
ruled out diagnoses (n = 72), encounters for VTE follow-up care rather than new onset cases 
(n = 24), thromboses in superficial rather than deep veins (n = 28), and adjudication decision 
(n = 6).

 We excluded an additional 5 of the 161 confirmed cases because they had incomplete health 
plan enrollment records at the time of VTE onset or vaccination to allow for the calculation 
of observation time, leaving 156 confirmed cases for analysis. Of these 156 confirmed cases, 
nine (6%) occurred in the 1–60 days following exposure to HPV4 dose 1, five (3%) 
following dose 2, two (1%) following dose 3, and 140 (90%) during pre- or post-vaccination 
unexposed observation time.
3.2. Case characteristics
Ninety-seven percent of the 101 confirmed DVTs included in our analysis were categorized 
as definite, 0% as probable, and 3% as possible. Seventy percent of confirmed DVTs were 
located in the lower extremities. Eighty-nine percent of the 71 confirmed PEs included in 
our analysis were categorized as definite, 0% as probable, and 11% as possible. On average, 
there was a delay of 4.4 days between symptom onset and diagnosis. Confirmed cases of 
VTE among males (n = 3) and 9–12 year olds (n = 4) were uncommon (Table 2). Most cases 
(97%) had at least one known VTE risk factor, and 47% had three or more risk factors. The 
most common risk factors in this population were hormonal contraceptive use, obesity, 
surgery or trauma in the 60 days prior to VTE diagnosis, and hypercoagulability. Among the 
92 women using hormonal contraceptives, 26 (28%) initiated contraceptive use within three 
months of VTE onset, 56 (61%) initiated more than three months before onset, and 10 (11%) 
had unknown initiation dates.
3.3. VTE risk associated with HPV4
We observed no increased risk of VTE in any exposure period; risk varied from 0.72 (95% 
CI: 0.31–1.63) in the 1–28 days following HPV4 exposure to 1.47 (95% CI: 0.47–4.64) in 
the 1–7 days following vaccination (Table 3). There were no males who had received HPV4 
within 60 days prior to VTE symptom onset, so their risk estimates could not be calculated. 
Risk ranged across the five exposure periods from 0.59 (95% CI: 0.08–4.27) to 1.20 (95% 
CI: 0.16–8.71) among 9–18 year-olds, and from 0.60 (95% CI: 0.19–1.92) to 1.66 (95% CI: 
0.40–6.81) among 19–26 year olds. Among females using hormonal contraceptives at the 
time of diagnosis, VTE risk ranged from 0.41 (95% CI: 0.10–1.69) to 1.16 (95% CI: 0.60–
2.23); risk among non-users ranged from 2.44 (95% CI: 0.59–10.12) in the 1–7 days after 
vaccination to 0.67 (95% CI: 0.26–1.72) in the 1–60 day period. There were no cases of 
VTE in the 1–14 days after vaccination with a recent surgery or trauma; the IRR ranged 
from 0.68 (95% CI: 0.25–1.88) to 2.15 (95% CI: 0.67–6.84) following vaccination among 
cases without a recent surgery or trauma.
4. Discussion
In this population-based cohort of adolescents and young adults, we observed no increased 
risk of VTE in the 1–60 days following HPV4 exposure. Despite the large population of 
adolescents and young adults included in the VSD, we identified only a small number of 
exposed VTE cases and were limited in our ability to rigorously evaluate potential effect 
modifiers through stratified analysis. Additional study of VTE risk in males, in particular, 
may be warranted since our study only identified three HPV4-exposed male confirmed 
cases.

 Our findings of no elevated VTE risk following HPV4 vaccination are consistent with the 
recently published Scandinavian studies, which reported risk estimates in the range of 0.77–
0.86 [4,6]. These prior studies did not validate cases with medical record review so they may 
have been biased toward the null hypothesis due to misclassification of both exposure 
periods and outcomes. Previous studies have demonstrated that the predictive values of 
ICD-9 codes for VTE range from 29% to 95% depending on the individual code, diagnosis 
setting (outpatient vs. inpatient), and the position of the code (primary vs. secondary) [17]. 
Medical record review is especially important since the case confirmation rate we observed 
in this study was low (54%) and symptom onset was on average more than four days before 
VTE diagnosis. Our study overcomes these previous limitations by using chart-reviewed 
cases that met a standard case definition and symptom onset date rather than the diagnosis 
date.
Recent findings from the U.S. Sentinel System are also consistent with the VSD results 
reported here [18]. The Sentinel System reported an overall positive predictive value of 24% 
for three VTE ICD-9 codes (415.1x, 451.x, and 453.x) that ranges from 6% in the outpatient 
setting to 64% in the inpatient setting. Using a self-controlled risk interval design and chart-
confirmed cases, the risk of VTE in the 1–28 day period following HPV4 exposure in 
females 9–26 years of age was 0.70 (95%CI: 0.33–1.44).
VTE is uncommon in the age group for whom HPV4 is licensed and recommended, with an 
estimated incidence of 1–7 cases per 10,000 in persons less than 30 years old [11–15]. The 
cases we identified had many other known risk factors for VTE, though small sample size 
limited our ability to investigate potential effect modification by these risk factors. The self-
controlled case series design inherently controls for risk factors, such as underlying genetic 
susceptibility to VTE, that do not change with time [9]. The method is less robust for time-
varying exposures, such as age, duration of contraceptive use, or acute events such as 
surgery or trauma. None of these exposures appeared to have significantly affected the risk 
of VTE following vaccination in our stratified models, although the baseline risk of VTE 
may have varied within the strata.
HPV4 vaccination could hypothetically induce thrombus formation and VTE by triggering 
inflammatory or coagulation pathways [19]. We selected the 1–60 day exposure period to 
encompass the period during which these pathways may be activated following an exposure 
and result in medically recognized VTE; however, previous studies have used risk periods as 
short as 7 days and as long as 90 days following vaccination. We saw small elevations in 
risk in the 1–7 day period following HPV4 exposure, but the number of cases exposed in 
these periods was small, and the corresponding confidence intervals were wide and not 
statistically significant. This elevation in the 1–7 days following vaccination is consistent 
with the RR of 1.98 observed in the Gee et al. VSD study [2]. Risk generally decreased as 
the exposure period lengthened and the number of exposed cases increased.
In conclusion, the risk of developing VTE among 9- to 26-year-olds was not elevated 
following HPV4 exposure based on this large U.S. study and on data from several other 
population-based studies. These findings should assure healthcare providers, parents, and 
patients about the safety of this vaccine.
