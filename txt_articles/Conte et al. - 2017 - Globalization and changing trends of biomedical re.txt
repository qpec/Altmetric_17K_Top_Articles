Biomedical research drives discovery and advances our understanding of human health and disease. The 
research enterprise also plays significant developmental and economic roles, fuels training of the next gen-
eration of physician and scientist investigators, and creates new technologies and jobs. Despite its impor-
tance, federal support for biomedical research in the US has been relatively unchanged for over a decade. 
For example, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which provides the bulk of federal funding for bio-
medical research, has had an essentially flat budget of ~$30 billion since 2008 until the $2 billion increase 
in 2016 for a total of ~$32 billion (1) and the additional increase of $2 billion for fiscal year 2017 that will 
boost the NIH budget to ~$34 billion (2). Although much of the budget increases have been directed to 
earmarked initiatives (e.g., Alzheimer disease, with $400 million of additional funds in 2017), the increase 
is welcome since the earmarks allow a potential net gain of support for investigator-initiated research. This 
stagnation in federal support for research raises many concerns, including whether the US will ultimately 
lose its global lead in biomedical research output and innovation as measured by scientific research articles, 
patents, and science and technology workforce (3). This concern is fueled by the relative decline in public 
sector and private industry research and development (R&D) expenditures in the US (compound –1.9% 
annual growth rate for 2007 to 2012, adjusted for inflation), as compared with an increase of 32.8% for 
China and 10%–11% for Singapore and South Korea (4).
As a measure of research output, we analyzed a select group of high-ranking clinical (JAMA, Lancet, 
New England Journal of Medicine) and basic science (Cell, Nature, Science), and mid-ranking clinical 
(British Medical Journal, JAMA Internal Medicine) and basic science (Journal of Cell Science, FASEB 
Journal) journals. The number of original research publications for these journals was individually and sys-
tematically estimated for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, 2013, and 2015 (see supplemental section for methods 
of accruing the articles; reviews, editorials, and commentaries were not included in the analysis; supple-
mental material available online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.95206DS1). For each 
article, the reported countries of origin for the corresponding authors and collaborators were tabulated, and 
manuscripts were classified into those arising from collaborations from one or more countries (e.g., the US 
vs. non-US). The percentage of basic and clinical manuscripts in high-ranking journals that include inter-
national collaborations increased from 26% of total publications in 2000 to 47% in 2015 (Supplemental 
Table 1), commensurate with a dramatic increase in the average number of papers with multiple authors 
(Supplemental Table 2). Although the percentage of papers published in high-ranking journals that origi-
nated solely from US-based authors decreased during 2000 to 2015, this was accompanied by an increase 
The US continues to lead the world in research and development (R&D) expenditures, but there 
is concern that stagnation in federal support for biomedical research in the US could undermine 
the leading role the US has played in biomedical and clinical research discoveries. As a readout of 
research output in the US compared with other countries, assessment of original research articles 
published by US-based authors in ten clinical and basic science journals during 2000 to 2015 
showed a steady decline of articles in high-ranking journals or no significant change in mid-ranking 
journals. In contrast, publication output originating from China-based investigators, in both 
high- and mid-ranking journals, has steadily increased commensurate with significant growth in 
R&D expenditures. These observations support the current concerns of stagnant and year-to-year 
uncertainty in US federal funding of biomedical research.

in papers from US-based corresponding authors in collaboration with 
international investigators (Figure 1 and Supplemental Table 1). Dur-
ing this 15-year span, the US maintained the highest ranking in terms 
of producing the most basic and clinical research articles published in 
high-ranking journals (Table 1; the same applies to publications in mid-
ranking journals, Supplemental Table 3). Notably, China ranked as 
number 14 during 2000 with 0.4% of total high-impact article output, 
but gradually and steadily ascended to the fourth-ranked country with 
1.4% of the total output (Table 1). The rise in output from China was 
noted in all manuscript categories we examined, including manuscripts 
that involved collaboration by China and other international authors 
(Figure 1). Great Britain and Germany maintained their second and 
third ranking, respectively; however, one notable drop in the ranking 
was Italy, which was among the top ten during 2000 and 2005 (Table 1) but moved outside the top-ten list 
for the years 2010, 2013, and 2015.
Parallel to the rise of China in terms of publication output is the dramatic increase in R&D expendi-
tures (normalized by purchasing power) relative to US expenditures. For example, China expenditures in 
2000 were only 12.2% of the US, but this increased steadily and dramatically to more than 70% during 2013 
and 2015 (Table 2). Of the top-ten countries in R&D expenditures after the US, China is the only country 
that has catapulted, while the remaining countries have not had major shifts in their expenditures (Table 2).
Figure 1. Biomedical research publication output for the US and China from 
2000 to 2015. (A) The percentage of manuscripts originating from China or 
the US that include international collaborations has been steadily increasing 
during the past 15 years regardless of the journal impact (China: P = 0.03 for 
high-impact and P = 0.008 for mid-impact journals; US: P = 0.001 for high-
impact and P = 0.05 for mid-impact journals). In contrast, the percentage of 
manuscripts that originated from US-based authors during 2000 to 2015 has 
decreased in high-impact journals (P = 0.007) or remained relatively unchanged 
for mid-impact journals (P = 0.28), while those originating from China-based 
authors has steadily increased in both high-impact (P = 0.02) and mid-impact 
journals (P = 0.04). (B) The percentage of manuscripts from the combined 
China-only authors and China-international collaborations has been steadily 
increasing regardless of the journal type (P = 0.001 and 0.04 for high- and mid-
impact journals, respectively), while there has not been a significant change for 
the combined US-only and US-international publications for high-impact (P = 
0.17) or mid-impact (P = 0.15) journals.

The analysis we describe provides a detailed snapshot of 2000 to 2015 trajectories from ten journals 
that cover clinical and basic sciences. This is a very small number compared with the full corpus of research 
publications — there are more than 17,000 science and engineering journals listed in the Scopus database 
alone. However, our in-depth analysis of the ten journals allowed us to discern the publication trends 
between journals of different rankings and journals of basic and clinical research. The general trends we 
observe are similar to those identified in larger samples. For example, the output for China has increased 
significantly when comparing total science and engineering articles in 2003 (6.4% for China vs. 26.8% for 
the US of total world publications) versus 2013 (18.2% for China vs. 18.8% for the US) (5). This indicates 
that our sample analysis is likely to be representative of other top journals, though it is possible that the 
trends may be different for subdisciplines in the biomedical sciences. The steady increase in international 
collaborations in the ten journals we examined (Supplemental Table 1) is also evident across all science and 
engineering disciplines (ranging from astronomy to biological, medical, and social sciences) as detailed in 
the 2016 National Science Foundation (NSF) report that compared data from 2000 versus 2013 (5).
In summary, our analysis shows that, even though the US still has a pronounced presence in biomedical 
research publications, there is a shift toward US-international collaboration instead of US-based research 
coupled with a decline in US-based research published in high-ranking journals (Figure 1). The increase 
in US-international collaboration is more obvious in high-ranking than mid-ranking journals, suggesting 
that this trend is indicative of a decline in US discoveries instead of the adoption of a more collaborative 
research culture. Should this decline alarm US researchers and policy makers? The good news is that the 
US clearly continues to lead in terms of its output and its investment in R&D (Figure 1, Tables 1 and 2, and 
refs. 2, 4, 5). However, stagnation of research funding in the US is a major concern that is compounded by 
year-to-year uncertainty in funding and the dependence on annual budget approval by Congress. Although 
throwing money at a problem is not a cure, the investments in R&D that China (6) and South Korea (7) 
have made are paying off in publication output, while investments in R&D as a percentage of the gross 
domestic product in the US and the European Union have been relatively flat for several years (7). If cur-
rent trends in R&D investments continue, it is predicted that China’s support for research will exceed that

Countries listed in Table 1 were ranked by R&D expenditure normalized by purchasing power, and R&D spending of countries commonly regarded as 
emerging powers in research. The percentages indicate R&D expenditure relative to US expenditure. US expenditure in billions of dollars is included in 
parentheses (row 2). The data were obtained from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Institute for Statistics 
(11) unless otherwise noted. The R&D expenditure in the UNESCO data is defined in the Frascati Manual. The 2015 data were estimated by R&D Magazine 
(12). While NIH funding has stayed relatively flat until recently, the business, higher-education sector, and nonprofit organizations have all increased their 
R&D funding during the same time period. Also shown are the numbers for South Korea and Singapore (in italics, last two rows), which more than doubled 
their R&D investments. Data for Australia for year 2005 were not available, so we used the average of the expenditures for years 2004 and 2006. Similarly, 
data for Sweden were not available for year 2000, so we used the average of the expenditures for years 1999 and 2001. For Switzerland, data were available 
only for years 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, and 2012. We calculated an annual increase in expenditure for Switzerland, using data from years 2000 and 2012 
and assuming a linear increase. Therefore, the numbers for Switzerland for years 2005, 2010, and 2013 are estimates.

of the US by 2022 (8). In addition to the need to enhance and stabilize the investment in fundamental and 
translational research and training, there are both strain and drain problems in the biomedical research 
enterprise and its workforce that have been eloquently highlighted (9) but not addressed. Increased and 
stable support for the NIH, NSF, and other federal funding agencies is needed, together with investments 
and support by businesses (e.g., a recent ad by business leaders published in the Wall Street Journal; ref. 
10). Importantly, strong input and endorsement by the public with engagement by the research commu-
nity are also essential if we are to maintain the lead in biomedical research that the US has enjoyed. The 
implications are immense, including economic and societal in addition to security and global ramifications.
