The skin’s tendency to sunburn rather than tan is a major risk factor for skin cancer. Here we
report a large genome-wide association study of ease of skin tanning in 176,678 subjects of
European ancestry. We identify significant association with tanning ability at 20 loci. We
confirm previously identified associations at six of these loci, and report 14 novel loci, of
which ten have never been associated with pigmentation-related phenotypes. Our results
also suggest that variants at the AHR/AGR3 locus, previously associated with cutaneous
malignant melanoma the underlying mechanism of which is poorly understood, might act on
disease risk through modulation of tanning ability.

un exposure has consistently been associated with increased
risk of all skin cancers, including cutaneous malignant
melanoma (CMM), basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell
carcinoma1. These are the most common types of cancer in
European populations of which the incidence rate is higher in
fair-skinned people, rather than darker-skinned people. The
tanning response after exposure to sunlight is mainly determined
by melanin pigmentation, and aims at protecting the skin from
DNA photodamage. Tanning response shows large variability
within and between populations. The heritability of ease of skin
tanning attributable to common genetic variation in the UK
Biobank sample [2] has been estimated to be 0.454 ± 0.006.
Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on European
populations have identified several DNA variants involved in
tanning ability or in skin sensitivity to sunlight, encompassing
seven genes, namely ASIP, EXOC2, HERC2, IRF4, MC1R,
SLC45A2 and TYR3–6, that are already known to be associated
with both pigmentation-related traits, such as hair, eye or skin
colour6–10, and skin cancer11–13. However, it has already been
observed than while some loci exert an effect on both pigmen-
tation and tanning ability, others have a more specific effect14.
This also suggests two pathways for skin cancer development: via
pigmentation or independent of pigmentation14.
To further investigate the genetic basis of skin tanning in
Europeans and their effect on skin cancer susceptibility, we per-
form here a large-scale GWAS using data from the UK Biobank15,
identifying ten novel associations, and replicating ten genes pre-
viously associated with ease of skin tanning or pigmentation-
related phenotypes. Additionally, we show a genetic correlation
between ease of skin tanning and non-melanoma skin cancer, and
highlight shared genetic effects between variants at AHR/AGR3
and tanning ability and CMM risk.
Results
Genome-wide association analyses. Ease of skin tanning and
genotype data were available for 121,296 individuals of European
ancestry from the UK Biobank15 (UKBB), which were divided in
two groups according to their skin’s ability to tan, with 38.6% of
the individuals reporting that they never tan and only burn, or get
mildly or occasionally tanned (Methods; Supplementary Table 1).
We carried out a genome-wide association analysis at 8,351,141
SNPs, assuming an additive genetic model, with sex included as
covariate,
and
applying
PCA-based
correction
to
address

stratification
(Methods;
Supplementary
Fig. 1). We identified 10,834 SNPs passing genome-wide
significance (P < 5.0 × 10−8) that mapped to 30 distinct loci
(Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 2, Supplementary Data 1 and
Supplementary Fig. 2 and 3). The genetic inflation factor λGC was
1.10. Therefore, to rule out the possibility that some associations
could be driven by confounding biases, we used the LD score
regression approach16, which confirmed the presence of an
underlying polygenic architecture (intercept = 1.04 ± 0.01).
We attempted to replicate these 30 loci in five additional
cohorts of European ancestry for which data on tanning ability
were available (N = 55,382; Methods; Supplementary Tables 3–8).
Meta-analysis of the results in these five replication cohorts
confirmed, at a Bonferroni-corrected threshold of 0.05/30 =
1.67 × 10−3, the association at 20 of the 30 top-associated SNPs at
each locus. The replicated loci encompass six genes previously

 associated with tanning ability, four genes previously associated
with pigmentation-related traits, and ten novel associations
(Table 1, Supplementary Tables 2 and 9, and Supplementary
Fig. 4–23). Conditional association analysis highlighted 14 further
independent genome-wide significant associations, which were
replicated in the additional cohorts (Supplementary Table 10).
Sex differences. It has been repeatedly observed that adult
females are fairer-skinned than males17. In this study, given the
large sample size and the highly significant effects identified, we
further investigated the sex-by-SNP interaction for the 20 loci
associated with tanning ability. We identified significant inter-
actions (P < 2.5 × 10−3) at five different loci in the UKBB data set,
which, however, were not confirmed in the additional cohorts
(Supplementary Table 11).
Genome-wide significant loci. Six of the identified loci included
genes associated with tanning ability in previous GWASs
(NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog, release 26 June 2017): HERC2/
OCA2, IRF4, MC1R, RALY/ASIP, SLC45A2 and TYR3–6. Addi-
tionally, we identified four other genes whose evidence of asso-
ciation with pigmentation-related traits had previously been
limited only to skin pigmentation (BNC29), hair colour (TPCN24)
or both hair and eye colour (SLC24A43 and TYRP14,18). The high
statistical power provided by the large UKBB sample size (>80%
for a common variant with minor allele frequency of 0.5 and odds
ratio >1.06 at α-level 5 × 10−8) allowed for the identification of
low-penetrance common DNA variants of small effect size at ten
novel genes. Five of these novel genes are known for their
involvement in melanin synthesis: DCT (TYRP2) which catalyses
melanin production;19 EMX2 and PPARGC1B, regulators of the
melanocyte-specific transcription factor (MITF)19,20, and PDE4B
and RIPK5, which have been suggested to be MITF targets21,22.
Five associations do not harbour any obvious candidate for ease
of skin tanning nor pigmentation: AHR/AGR3 ATP11A, TRPS1,
KIAA0930 and an intergenic region flanking the PA2G4P4
pseudogene, whose functional role in tanning ability would
require further investigation. Interestingly, KIAA0930 encodes the
Q6ICG6 protein that interacts with the tyrosine 3-mono-
oxygenase/tryptophan
5-monooxygenase
activation
protein,
which have been suggested to be important in melanocyte
development in a mouse model23.
Among the genes identified by the conditional analysis, namely
CHMP1A, FANCA, SPIRE2, DEF8, AFG3L1P, DBNDD1 and
PRDM7, DBNDD1 has been previously associated with tanning
ability5, while mutations in the FANCA gene are responsible for
Fanconi anaemia, a disease characterised by short stature, bone
marrow failure and increased risk of multiple cancers. Affected
individuals present areas of skin hypopigmentation and café au
lait spots with abnormal melanin deposition.
Effect of ease of skin tanning variants on skin cancer. Several of
the identified genes have previously been associated with
increased susceptibility to skin cancer. Common DNA variants at
the
AFG3L1P,
AGR3,
HERC2/OCA2,
MC1R,
RALY/ASIP,
SLC45A2 and TYR genes have been linked to CMM11,24, and
common DNA variants at the AHR, ASIP, BNC2, DEF8, IRF4,
MC1R, OCA2, TYR and SLC45A2 genes have been associated
with non-melanoma skin cancer risk12,13,25. ATP11A was sig-
nificantly associated in the first stage of a large GWAS including
12,945 self-reported basal cell carcinoma cases and 274,252
controls of European ancestry from the 23andMe database (but
failed replication in the final meta-analysis)13, with top associa-
tion at
rs1765871
(P = 4.9 × 10−9)
in strong
linkage
dis-
equilibrium with our top-associated SNP (rs1046793; r2 = 0.90).
Suggestive association with skin cancer has also been reported for
TRPS112. Additionally, common variants at the FANCA gene
have been suggested to predict melanoma survival26.
While the number of melanoma cases in the UKBB data
set was not sufficient to generate a reliable estimate of the genetic

 correlation between ease of skin tanning and CMM, we could
estimate the genetic correlation of ease of skin tanning with non-
melanoma skin cancer, which amounted to ρ = 0.33 (SD = 0.16,
P = 0.04; Methods, Supplementary Tables 12 and 13, Supple-
mentary Figs. 24 and 25, and Supplementary Data 2).
The present study also shows association with ease of skin
tanning for the locus encompassing AGR3/AHR, which has
previously been associated with CMM risk11 but not with tanning
ability nor pigmentation. Our association at AGR3/AHR overlaps
with previous findings for CMM risk, with rs1721028 (secondary
association at AGR3/AHR) showing r2 > 0.8 with rs1636744,
identified by Law et al.11. We further investigate whether variants
at this locus exert a shared effect on tanning ability and CMM
using a Bayesian bivariate approach27 (Methods). The AGR3/
AHR posterior probability for shared genetic effects between
tanning ability and CMM was 1, thus indicating that the same
genetic variants are involved in both decreased tanning ability
and increased risk of melanoma.
Effects of ease of skin tanning variants on hair colour. We
further investigated the effects of loci associated with tanning
ability in our study on hair colour, which was also characterised
in the UKBB data set. Specifically, we separately assessed the
association with non-red hair colour, and with red versus non-red
hair colour (Methods; Supplementary Tables 14 and 15). Most of
the genes that have been previously associated with non-red hair
colour4,6,8,18 (i.e., IRF4, HERC2/OCA2, SLC24A4, SLC45A2,
TPCN2 and TYRP1) showed a stronger association with non-red
hair colour than with ease of skin tanning, with the exception of
MC1R, RALY/ASIP and TYR (Supplementary Table 16). We
additionally observed three genome-wide significant associations
between non-red hair colour and BNC2 (previously associated
with freckles8 and facial pigmentation9), DCT, and RIPK5, which
were confirmed and replicated in a large meta-analysis study28. A
marginal association was observed at KIAA0930. Red hair showed
significant association with IRF4, HERC2/OCA2, MC1R and
RALY/ASIP, while a marginal association was observed at
SLC45A2 (Supplementary Table 17). Only MC1R was more
strongly associated with red hair colour than with ease of skin
tanning. Overall, seven loci were exclusively associated with
tanning ability (AHR/AGR3, ATP11A, EMX2, PA2G4P4, PDE4B,
PPARGC1B and TRPS1).
Effect of MC1R variants on tanning ability and hair colour. To
better characterise the MC1R gene, which plays central roles
in pigmentation and in the melanocyte response to UV exposure,
we took advantage of the large UKBB sample size and tested the
association between the nine most studied MC1R variants29
present in our panel (D84E, D294H, I155T, R142H, R151C,
R160W, R163Q, V60L and V92M) and both ease of skin
tanning and natural hair colour. Among these, the NHGRI-
EBI GWAS catalogue reports association between R151C and
ease of skin tanning, freckles, hair and skin colour3,6, and both
melanoma30 and non-melanoma skin cancers12,13. A haplotype,
including multiple MC1R variants, was also associated with skin
pigmentation10. In the UKBB data set, all variants apart from
I155T, were strongly associated with red hair colour, and all
variants but R163Q were associated with non-red hair (Supple-
mentary Table 18). Moreover, all the studied nine variants but
two (R163Q and V92M) were highly significantly associated with
ease of skin tanning (Supplementary Table 19). Interestingly,
these variants at the MC1R gene completely explained our top-
associated signal at rs369230, which changed from P = 1.00 × 10
−522 to 0.37.
Functional enrichment analyses. We defined an expanded set of
SNPs including the replicated SNPs and those in strong linkage
disequilibrium with them (r2 ≥ 0.8, N = 599). This set was enri-
ched (empirical P < 0.05) for cis-eQTLs identified at 5% FDR in
sun-exposed skin tissue and fibroblast, but not in non-sun
exposed skin tissue from the GTEx consortium project31
(Methods; Supplementary Table 20). Interestingly, DNA variants
at the locus harbouring the MC1R gene regulate, among others, in
sun-exposed skin tissue, the SPATA33 gene, that has been asso-
ciated with facial pigmentation9 and cutaneous squamous cell
carcinoma25, and, in all tissues, the CDK10 gene, that has been
associated with CMM24 (Supplementary Data 3).
The expanded set of replicated SNPs was also enriched
(empirical P < 0.05) for regulatory elements from the RoadMap
consortium project32 (Methods; Supplementary Table 21). Spe-
cifically, we found a significant enrichment for the enhancer
marks H3K36me3 and H3K27ac, which are associated with
actively transcribed regions; H3K4me1, which modulates the
chromatin structure facilitating transcription factors accessibility;
and H3K4me3, which is associated with transcriptional start sites
of actively transcribed genes. We also observed enrichment for
DNase I hypersensitive sites, which highlight regions of open
chromatin that are associated to transcriptional activity and
transcription factors accessibility.
Discussion
In this large-scale GWAS of ease of skin tanning in 176,678
Europeans, we have replicated ten loci previously associated with
ease of skin tanning or pigmentation-related phenotypes (BNC2,
HERC2/OCA2, IRF4, MC1R, RALY/ASIP, SLC24A4, SLC45A2,
TPCN2, TYR and TYRP1), and identified ten novel associations
(AHR/AGR3,
ATP11A,
DCT,
EMX2,
KIAA0930,
PA2G4P4,
PDE4B, PPARGC1B, RIPK5 and TRPS1).
The tanning response is determined by an increase in melanin
production in melanocytes stimulated by ultraviolet radiation.
We identified five novel associations between ease of skin tanning
and genes previously suggested to be involved in the melanin
synthesis pathway (DCT, EMX2, PDE4B, PPARGC1B and RIPK5)
19–22. The relative proportion of eumelanin (dark/brown pig-
ment) and phaeomelanin (red/yellow pigment) is regulated by the
MC1R gene, which is highly polymorphic in the European
population33. Different low/intermediate-frequency variants in
this gene have been associated with multiple pigmentation-related
phenotypes3,8,9 and both melanoma11,24,30 and non-melanoma
skin cancer12,13. Taking advantage of the large UKBB sample size,
we tested the association between the nine most studied variants
at MC1R29 and ease of skin tanning. Seven of these variants were
highly significantly associated with ease of skin tanning, and they
could fully explain our top GWAS association at the MC1R locus.
Non-melanoma skin cancer is the most common type of cancer
in the United Kingdom and is well represented in the UKBB data
set. Our analyses showed genetic correlation between non-
melanoma skin cancer and ease of skin tanning in the UKBB data
set. Overall, eight loci associating with ease of skin tanning in our
study have been previously shown to influence the susceptibility
to either non-melanoma skin cancer (BNC2 and IRF4)12,13 or
both
non-melanoma
skin
cancer
and
CMM (AHR/AGR3,

Law et al. GWASs results indicated that the same genetic variants
at the AGR3/AHR locus were driving the associations at both

 phenotypes, thus suggesting that common variants at this locus
might increase CMM susceptibility through modulation of ease of
skin tanning. Taken together, these results broaden the spectrum
of DNA variants involved in ease of skin tanning, and potentially
modulating skin cancer risk.
Finally, functional enrichment analysis at the associated DNA
variants showed an enrichment for cis-eQTLs identified at 5%
FDR in sun-exposed skin tissue and fibroblast from the GTEx
consortium project31, and for regulatory elements from the the
RoadMap consortium project32, consistently with the observation
that variants identified through GWASs are more likely to act
through effects on gene regulation rather than directly altering
protein-coding sequences.
Methods
Discovery cohort. The UK Biobank15 (UKBB) is a prospective cohort study of
over 500,000 individuals from across the United Kingdom, aged between 40 and
70. Blood, urine and saliva samples were collected and each participant answered
an extensive questionnaire on health and lifestyle. Written informed consent was
obtained from each participant, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Genotyping and imputation. A total of 152,736 samples belonging to the interim
data release of UK Biobank genetic data (May 2015) were genotyped using a
combination of two arrays: the UK Biobank Axiom array from Affymetrix (N =
102,754), that was specifically designed for the purpose of genotyping the UK
Biobank participants, and the UK BiLEVE array (N = 49,982), that was designed to
study the genetics of lung health and disease. The UK10K haplotype reference and
the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 reference panels were merged and used as reference
panel in the IMPUTE2 software34. Kinship coefficients for all pairs were calculated
using KING’s robust estimator35 and used to identify and remove related indivi-
duals. Imputation, relatedness assessment and quality control were performed by
the analysis group at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University
of Oxford. Details are provided at the UK Biobank website (httpλ://biobank.ctsu.
ox.ac.uk). A total of 8,351,141 SNPs meeting the following conditions were
included in our genome-wide association study: call rate ≥95%, minor allele fre-
quency (MAF) ≥1% and Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium test with P ≥ 1 × 10−9.
Phenotyping. Ease of skin tanning was collected for 460,922 individuals with self-
reported European ethnicity, 140,749 of whom had genotype data. Individuals that
reported themselves to be of European ancestry but described their skin colour as
'black' were removed from the data set. As carried out in previous studies of similar
phenotypes3,4 and in order to reduce misclassifications in the self-reported data,
individuals reporting that they never tanned only burn, or get mildly or occasionally
tanned were included in the group of individuals showing a low tan response, while
people who reported getting moderately or very tanned were included in the group of
individuals showing a high tan response. Reliability of the reported tanning ability was
cross-verified using self-reported information on hair colour, and 2947 individuals
reporting themselves to have red hair yet declaring that they get very or moderately
tanned were removed from the data set. We further removed 16,067 individuals who
were estimated to be genetically related, and 439 individuals showing signs of
insufficient data quality, resulting in 121,296 individuals (Supplementary Table 1).
Association study. Logistic regression was performed using PLINK36 (version
1.90 b3.38) assuming an additive genetic model and including sex as covariate,
as well as the first five principal components assessed on the genomic data to
control for potential population stratification. Associations were considered sig-
nificant and taken forward for replication if the UKBB discovery P value was lower
than 5.0 × 10−8. Genome-wide Manhattan and Q–Q plots were generated using the
qqman R package37 (version 0.1.2). Regional Manhattan plots for the associated
loci were generated using LocusZoom Standalone38. The genotype data from the
individuals included in the UKBB data set was used to estimate a more accurate
LD structure.
LD score regression analysis. The genomic inflation factor (λGC) was calculated
as the ratio between the observed and expected median χ2 statistics. We used the
LD score regression (LDSC) software16 (version 1.0.0) to quantify the proportion of
such inflation that was due to the presence of polygenic inheritance and to other
confounding biases, such as population stratification. Briefly, the LDSC approach
evaluates an LD score based on an unbiased estimator of the squared Pearson’s
correlation, and then regresses the χ2 statistics against it. The mean contribution of
confounding biases in the test statistics is evaluated as the intercept of the
regression model minus one. LD scores were evaluated using the 1000 Genomes
Project European data16.
Identification of independent signals within loci. We used a stepwise procedure
to identify independent signals within the loci identified in the UKBB sample.
Specifically, we extended each locus to include a 1 Mb flanking region either side
and fitted a new regression model, where the top-associated genome-wide sig-
nificant SNP was included as a covariate (conditional model). We considered the
genome-wide significant (P < 5 × 10−8) top-associated SNP resulting from the
conditional model as an independent signal, and included it in the covariate set of a
new conditional model. We stopped the stepwise procedure when we could not
identify any additional genome-wide significant SNPs. Conditional models were
build using PLINK36 (version 1.90 b3.38).
Replication cohorts. The TwinsUK cohort includes more than 13,000 mono-
zygotic and dizygotic twin volunteers from all regions across the United
Kingdom39. The phenotype was collected via nurse-administered questionnaires
using the Fitzpatrick classification40 and dichotomised into two categories: low
(sun-reactive skin type I and II) and high (sun-reactive skin type III and IV) tan
response. Phenotypic and genotypic data were available for 3937 female individuals
with European ancestry (Supplementary Table 3). Microarray genotyping was
conducted using a combination of Illumina arrays (HumanHap300, Human-
Hap610, 1M-Duo and 1.2M-Duo 1 M) and imputation was performed using the
IMPUTE2 software using haplotype information from the 1000 Genomes Project
(Phase 1, integrated variant set across 1092 individuals, v2, March 2012), as pre-
viously described41. Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital NHS Trust Research Ethics
Committee approved the study, and all twins provided informed written consent.
The Rotterdam Study (RS) is a prospective study of men and women from the
Ommoord municipality of Rotterdam, the Netherlands42. Subjects were genotyped
using the Infinium II HumanHap550 K and Human 610 Quad Arrays of Illumina.
Imputation was performed using the MaCH and minimac software packages and
the 1000 Genomes Project (Phase 1, integrated variant set across 1092 individuals,
v2, March 2012) as the reference panel, as described elsewhere43. Ease of skin
tanning was collected on 10,451 individuals via questionnaires, and individuals
who reported getting easily burned while in the sun were considered as having a
low tan response (Supplementary Table 4). All Rotterdam Study participants have
provided written informed consent. The study has been approved by the medical
ethics committee according to the Wet Bevolkingsonderzoek ERGO (Population
Study Act Rotterdam Study), executed by the Ministry of Health, Welfare and
Sports of the Netherlands.
The Australian Study from the Queensland Institute of Medical Research
(QIMR) comprises twins and their family members taking part in a long-running
study of melanoma risk factors44. Two independent samples were used for this
analysis. The first included adolescent twins, their siblings and parents, and the
second a collection of adult twins. These were genotyped in two phases. Phase
1 samples were genotyped using Illumina Human610-Quadv1_B arrays at
deCODE Genetics, Iceland. For imputation, they were merged with a larger set of
individuals genotyped on Human610-Quadv1_B, and Human660W-Quad_v1_C
arrays. Phase 2 samples were genotyped on HumanOmniExpress-12v1-1_A,
HumanOmni25M-8v1-1_B and HumanCoreExome 12v1-0_C arrays from
Illumina at the Diamantina Institute, University of Queensland. Self-reported ease
of skin tanning was collected on 5509 individuals from the adolescents plus
parents, and on 2248 individuals from the adult twins, but only a total of 5149
individuals had genotype data and were included in this analysis (Supplementary
Tables 5 and 6). Individuals reporting that they never tanned only burn, or usually
burn and sometimes tanned were included in the group of individuals showing a
low tan response, while people who reported of usually or always getting tanned
were included in the group of individuals showing a high tan response. The study
protocol was approved by appropriate institutional review boards, and all
participants have provided written informed consent.
The Nurses’ Health Study (NHS), the Nurses’ Health Study 2 (NHS2) and the
Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS) are three large prospective cohort
studies of US men and women of European ancestry (HS). Ease of skin tanning was
assessed on 35,845 individuals by asking what kind of tan was developed after
repeated sun exposures (e.g., a 2-week vacation outdoors) during childhood or
adolescence, and categorised into a binary variable (Supplementary Table 7).
Subjects were genotyped on multiple arrays (Affymetrix, Illumina HumanHap,
Illumina OmniExpress, HumanCore Exome and OncoArray; Supplementary
Table 8) and imputed to approximately 47 million markers using the 1000
Genomes mixed population Project Phase 3 Integrated Release Version 5 (2010–11
data freeze, 2012-03-14 haplotypes) as reference panels. Specifically, SNP genotypes
were imputed in two steps. First, genotypes on each chromosome were phased
using ShapeIT (v2.r837). Then, phased data were submitted to the Michigan
Imputation Server, and imputed using Minimac3. The protocol of the study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board of Brigham and Women’s Hospital and
the Harvard School of Public Health.
Meta-analysis. Association studies in the TwinsUK and QIMR cohorts were
conducted for individual SNPs using a linear mixed model as implemented in
Merlin45 and GEMMA46, respectively, in order to take into account the non-
independence of twin data. Association studies in the RS and in the HS cohorts
were conducted using a logistic regression model adjusting for sex, age and the first
five genotype principal components. Specifically, in the HS cohort, associations in

 each component GWAS set (Affymetrix, Illumina HumanHap series, Illumina
OmniExpress, HumanCore Exome, and OncoArray) were combined in an
inverse-variance-weighted meta-analysis using the METAL software47.
Meta-analyses of the results obtained in the replication cohorts were carried out
using a weighted Z-score method based on sample size, P value and direction of
effect in each study as implemented in the METAL software47. We considered an
association replicated when the meta-analysis P value reached a Bonferroni-
adjusted significance threshold of P < 0.05/30 = 1.67 × 10−3.
SNP-by-sex interaction. We assessed SNP-by-sex interaction in the UKBB data set
for all replicated SNPs using PLINK36 (version 1.90 b3.38). The first five principal
components assessed on the genomic data were included as covariates to control for
potential stratification issues. We considered an interaction term significant when its
P value reached a Bonferroni-adjusted significance threshold of P < 0.05/20 = 2.5 ×
10−3. We then attempted replication using four of our replication cohorts (the
TwinsUK cohort included only female individuals). The meta-analysis in the repli-
cation cohorts was performed using a weighted Z-score method based on sample
size, P value and direction of effect in each study as implemented in the METAL
software. We considered the interaction replicated when the meta-analysis P value
was smaller than the Bonferroni-adjusted significance threshold of P < 0.05/5 = 0.01.
Power calculations. Power was assessed with Genetic Power Calculator48
assuming a prevalence of 40% for increased tanning ability—as observed in both
the UKBB (42%) and TwinsUK (38%) data sets.
Identification of known loci. We interrogated the NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalogue49
(release 26 June 2017; association P < 5 × 10−8) to identify overlap between SNPs
identified in our study (or in tight linkage disequilibrium with them; r2 ≥ 0.8) and
previously reported associations for ease of skin tanning, pigmentation-related
phenotypes and skin cancer.
Genetic correlation between tanning ability and skin cancer. The 2017 release
of the UK Biobank genetic data included a further 367,186 individuals. We removed
968 individuals flagged because of low genetic data quality, 120,502 individuals who
were estimated to be genetically related and 57,157 individuals affected by any
cancer, either malignant or in situ, resulting in 907 CMM (ICD-10 code: C43) and
5912 non-melanoma skin cancer (ICD-10 code: C44) cases, and 181,740 controls
(Supplementary Table 12). Genotype data were processed as described in 'Geno-
typing and imputation', resulting in 5,734,850 SNPs meeting the following condi-
tions: call rate ≥95%, minor allele frequency (MAF) ≥1% and Hardy–Weinberg
equilibrium test with P ≥ 1 × 10−9. Due to the small number of CMM cases, we only
assessed association between ease of skin tanning and non-melanoma skin cancer
using a logistic regression approach, as implemented in PLINK (version 2.00),
assuming an additive genetic model, and including age, sex, genotyping array and
the first five principal components assessed on the genomic data as covariates.
We used the cross-trait LD score regression (LDSC) software16,50 (version 1.0.0)
to estimate the genetic correlation between ease of skin tanning and cancer
occurrence. We followed the protocol described in Bulik-Sullivan et al.50, removing
indels, structural variants, strand ambiguous SNPs and those with MAF <1%. LD
scores were evaluated using the 1000 Genomes Project European data16.
Identification of loci affecting CMM and tanning ability. We applied a Bayesian
bivariate analysis as implemented in GWAS-PW27 to investigate whether loci here
associated with ease of skin tanning and previously involved in melanoma risk
exert a shared effect on both ease of skin tanning and CMM, using data from a
large meta-analysis of CMM11 (Ncase = 15,990; Ncontrol = 26,409). GWAS-PW
estimates the posterior probability that each locus includes a genetic variant which
(i) associated only with CMM, (ii) associated only with tanning ability, (iii) asso-
ciated with both traits or (iv) that the genomic block includes two genetic variants,
associating independently with each of the two traits.
Association study with natural hair colour. Self-reported hair colour was
assessed via questionnaire in 118,777 out of 121,296 individuals used in this study
(Supplementary Tables 14 and 15). To assess association between hair colour and
the loci replicated in our study of ease of skin tanning, we used (a) a linear
regression model to test association with non-red-haired individuals where blonde
= 1, light brown = 2, dark brown and black = 3, and (b) a logistic regression model
to test association with red versus non-red hair colour. Both linear and logistic
regression were performed using PLINK36 (version 1.90 b3.38) assuming an
additive genetic model and including age, sex and the first five principal compo-
nents assessed on the genomic data as covariates.
GTEx cis-eQTL analysis. To study whether the replicated SNPs have a regulatory
effect on gene expression levels, we used expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
data in three skin tissues from the GTEx consortium project31 (data release v6),
namely fibroblasts, sun-exposed skin (lower leg) and non-sun-exposed skin
(suprapubic). cis-eQTLs were defined by the GTEx consortium as SNPs 1 MB
around the transcript start site passing 5% FDR31. We extended the set of 34
independent SNPs replicated for ease of skin tanning by including any SNP in high
linkage disequilibrium (r2 ≥ 0.8) with them using SNAP Proxy Search51 and data
from both the HapMap 3 (release 2) and 1000 Genome (pilot 1) projects. We then
evaluated an empirical enrichment P value by comparing the overlap between the
set of cis-eQTLs in the GTEx project database and the original extended set of SNPs
with the overlap obtained using 1000 random sets of SNPs created using a cyclic
permutation procedure52.
Analysis of epigenetic marks. By following the same procedure described above
for the cis-eQTL enrichment analysis, we additionally assessed enrichment and
depletion of epigenetic markers by using histone marks and DNA accessibility peak
data in epithelial foreskin melanocyte primary cells from the Roadmap consortium
project32 (data release v9). We focused on a core set of histone modifications
(namely: H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K36me3, H3K9me3 and H3K27ac)
and DNA-seq accessibility data. Since the histone modification data for the studied
cell line was available from two donors, we averaged the overlaps among samples.
