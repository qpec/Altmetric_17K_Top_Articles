Disparities and change over time in distance women would 
need to travel to have an abortion in the USA: a spatial 
analysis
Jonathan M Bearak, Kristen Lagasse Burke, Rachel K Jones
Summary
Background Abortion can help women to control their fertility and is an important component of health care for 
women. Although women in the USA who live further from an abortion clinic are less likely to obtain an abortion 
than women who live closer to an abortion clinic, no national study has examined inequality in access to abortion and 
whether inequality has increased as the number of abortion clinics has declined.
Methods For this analysis, we obtained data on abortion clinics for 2000, 2011, and 2014 from the Guttmacher 
Institute’s Abortion Provider Census. Block groups and the percentage of women aged 15–44 years by census tract 
were obtained from the US Census Bureau. Distance to the nearest clinic was calculated for the population-weighted 
centroid of every block group. We calculated the median distance to an abortion clinic for women in each county and 
the median and 80th percentile distances for each state by weighting block groups by the number of women of 
reproductive age (15–44 years).
Findings In 2014, women in the USA would have had to travel a median distance of 10·79 miles (17·36 km) to reach 
the nearest abortion clinic, although 20% of women would have had to travel 42·54 miles (68·46 km) or more. We 
found substantially greater variation within than between states because, even in mostly rural states, women and 
clinics were concentrated in urban areas. We identified spatial disparities in abortion access, which were broadly 
unchanged, at least as far back as 2000.
Interpretation We showed substantial and persistent spatial disparities in access to abortion in the USA. These results 
contribute to an emerging literature documenting similar disparities in other high-income countries.

Introduction
Induced abortion allows women to control their fertility, 
and ensuring that all women in the USA have access 
to abortion is a public health goal.1,2 In 2011, 
2·8 million (45%) of the 6·1 million pregnancies in 
the USA were unintended, and 42% of unintended 
pregnancies ended in abortion.3 However, abortion is 
not always easy to access in the USA, and issues such 
as stigma, restrictive laws, and financial constraints can 
pose barriers to access. One key measure of access is 
how far women have to travel to reach an abortion 
clinic. Previous research4–7 found that the further a 
woman lives from a provider, the less likely she is to 
obtain an abortion. Most patients seeking an abortion 
have limited financial resources, so having to cover the 
cost of travel (which can include overnight stays and 
time off work) might prevent them from having an 
abortion.8
Spatial inequality—unequal access to resources and 
services based on location—affects access to abortion in 
many countries where it is legal.9 Studies10–13 in 
Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the USA have 
found that, among women who have abortions, those 
who live in rural areas typically travel greater distances 
than those who live in urban areas, at least in part 
because of subnational variation in restrictive laws.13
At least 20 US states have adopted one or more 
abortion restrictions since 2011 (appendix), making 
analysis of spatial inequality in that country particularly 
timely and relevant.14 In 2008, patients in the USA 
travelled a median distance of 15 miles (24 km) to have 
an abortion.15 Although the median distance travelled 
was reasonably low, a substantial minority of 
women (17%) travelled 50 miles (80 km) or more, and 
31% of women living in rural areas travelled 100 miles 
(161 km) or more to have an abortion. A 2016 study16 
examined the change in how far women travelled for an 
abortion in the state of Texas after implementation of a 
restrictive law, which resulted in the closure of 22 (54%) 
of 41 abortion providers in the state. Similar to women 
nationally, patients in Texas in 2013 travelled a mean 
distance of 15 miles (24 km) to reach an abortion facility. 
The mean distance increased by 20 miles (32 km), to 
35 miles (56 km), in 2014 after the law came into effect,

and the number of patients who travelled more than 
50 miles (80 km) increased from 10% to 44%.16
A limitation of those analyses was that they examined 
users of abortion services and did not capture women 
who wanted abortions but did not make it to the clinic 
because of distance; thus, they did not fully capture 
spatial inequality in access to abortions.4–7 Two studies4,7 
found that the number of abortions in a county in Texas 
decreased as the distance to the nearest abortion facility 
increased between 2012 and 2014. Previous studies5,6 that 
used abortion data for the states of New York and 
Georgia in the 1970s also found that the further women 
lived from a county or state where abortion care was 
provided, the lower the abortion incidence. These 
studies suggest that distance has been a persistent 
barrier to abortion.
Between 2011 and 2014, abortion incidence in the USA 
decreased by 14% to 14·6 abortions per 1000 women 
(15–44 years) each year.17 During the same period, the 
number of clinics providing abortions decreased by 6%, 
from 839 to 788, compared with a 1% decline across the 
preceding 3 year period.17 The decline in clinics was 
greatest in the midwest (22%) and southern (13%) 
regions, which also had the highest number of abortion 
restrictions enacted over this period.17 As abortion clinics 
closed and service availability shifted, women might have 
had to travel further to have an abortion.
Using abortion-clinic data for 2014, 2011, and 2000, we 
examined spatial disparities in distance to the nearest 
abortion clinic by state and county. Because a decline in 
the number of abortion clinics might have increased the 
distance women had to travel to reach a provider,17 we 
also examined state-specific and county-specific changes 
in distance to abortion clinics between 2011 and 2014. In 
a supplementary analysis to assess the long-term 
stability of access to abortion, we also analysed change 
since 2000.
Methods
Study design
We obtained the location of all abortion clinics in the 
USA from the Guttmacher Institute’s Abortion Provider 
Census (APC). Since 1973, the Guttmacher Institute has 
regularly surveyed all known abortion-providing facilities 
to collect information about number of abortions and 
other aspects of service provision. The APC provides the 
most accurate counts of abortion available in the USA.18 
In the most recent APC, information was collected for 
2014.17 We also used data for 2011 and 2000 in this analysis. 
Approval for the study was obtained through expedited 
review by the Guttmacher Institute’s federally registered 
institutional review board.
To identify clinics providing abortion services to the 
public, we limited the analysis to facilities that had 
caseloads of 400 abortions or more per year and those 
affiliated with Planned Parenthood that did at least one 
abortion in the period of interest. We included Planned 
Parenthood facilities that provided fewer than 400 abortions 
in a year because of name recognition and because their 
websites indicated whether they provided abortion services. 
These providers did 95% of all abortions in 2014; of the 
remainder, 2·1% occurred in hospitals, 1·4% in private 
physicians’ offices, and 1·5% in health clinics.
Not all locations where abortions are done are 
accessible and discoverable to a woman seeking abortion 
care. Abortion providers in the USA have been targets of 
domestic terrorism, and doctors might be unable to 
maintain a practice if they are known to be willing to do 
abortions. Our data collection efforts showed that 
facilities doing small numbers of abortions seldom 
advertise their services. Thus, it is possible for a woman 
to live near to an abortion provider without knowing of 
that physician or that the physician provides abortions. 
Such a provider would not constitute a public point of 
access, and these were excluded from our analysis. 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Between Feb 1, 2017, and April 1, 2017, we searched Google 
Scholar for studies about spatial inequality in abortion access 
using the search terms “abortion and distance”, “abortion 
access”, and “spatial inequality”. We reviewed the reference 
lists and reverse citations of relevant articles. Studies of 
high-income countries in which abortion is legal have 
identified spatial disparities in access to abortion facilities. 
Within the USA, studies using data from individual states 
have shown an inverse association between distance to 
nearest abortion provider and county abortion incidence. 
Meanwhile, many areas of the USA are implementing 
restrictive policies aimed at curtailing abortion. However, no 
national study has examined spatial inequality in access to 
abortion in the USA.
Added value of this study
We present the first national estimates of spatial disparities in 
distance to the nearest abortion provider in the USA. This study 
is also the first to take into account the geographical 
distribution of women. This approach allowed estimation of 
the median distance that a woman would have to travel to an 
abortion provider in each county and state and the 
80th percentile distance that 20% of women in each state live 
from the nearest clinic. We characterised spatial disparities 
within and across states, and the stability of these disparities 
over a 15 year period, from 2000 to 2014.
Implications of all the available evidence
We showed persistant spatial disparities in women’s access to 
abortion in the USA that might be applicable to women in 
other high-income countries.

Moreover, confidentiality concerns did not allow us to 
reveal the locations of low-volume providers because 
doing so would threaten their safety. 
Statistical analysis
To measure the distance between women and abortion 
providers, we first needed to specify the location of both. 
For women, we used the smallest publicly available 
geographical units, census block groups, which are 
geographical subdivisions of census tracts.19 For their 
coordinates, we used population-weighted centroids.20 For 
abortion providers, we geocoded (ie, determined the latitude 
and longitude of) each provider using Maptitude 2016, and 
linked each census block group to the nearest provider. 
Some women obtain abortions outside their state of 
residence; as such, in our analysis the nearest provider 
could be in another county or state. We used Open Source 
Routing Machine 4.9 to compute driving distance.21

To estimate mean and percentile distances for each 
state and county, we weighted each block group by the 
approximate number of women of reproductive age 
(15–44 years). We obtained population data for 2000 and 
2010 from the Decennial Census.22,23 The smallest 
geographical area for which age and sex distributions 
were available was census tract; therefore, we multiplied 
each block group’s population by the proportion of the 
census tract that was made up of women aged 15–44 years. 
To account for population growth after 2010, the last year 
a census was done, we scaled each block group’s 
population using the Census Bureau’s 2011 and 2014 
county population estimates.24
Mean distances were right skewed by the small 
proportion of women who lived several 100 miles from 
the nearest provider. For this reason, we used median 
distance or the value for which half of women in a 
county lived from the nearest provider. In our state-
level analyses, we also examined 80th percentile 
distances.
We analysed whether distance to provider varied by 
the National Center for Health Statistics’ urban-rural 
classification scheme, an extension of the Office of 
Management and Budget metropolitan statistical area 
(MSA) classification.25 
No smooth gradient was seen in the number of 
abortions done by providers; of the providers excluded 
from the analysis in 2014, 631 (62%) did fewer than 
25 abortions, whereas 38 (4%) did 300–399 abortions. 
A concern was that a small number of abortions might 
have placed a provider above or below 400 abortions so 
as to substantively affect our results. To address this 
possibility, we did a sensitivity analysis that included all 
providers who did at least 200 abortions.
Another concern was that rural areas might have been 
served by providers who did very few abortions. However, 
although 43% of counties were rural, less than 1% of the 
excluded providers were in rural areas. All of these were 
either hospitals or physicians’ offices, except for one clinic, 
which did not advertise abortion services on its website.
We excluded the District of Columbia from the tables 
and discussion of the findings (but not from the overall 
analysis) because it is not a state. In both 2011 and 2014, 
the District of Columbia had four or more abortion 
clinics,17,26 and residents would have had to travel a 
median distance of 2 miles to reach the nearest clinic 
(shorter than the median distance in any state).
Role of the funding source
The funding source did not have any role in the study 
design, data collection, data analysis, writing of the 
manuscript, or in the decision to submit the paper for 
publication. The corresponding author had full access to 
all the data in the study and had final responsibility for 
the decision to submit for publication.
Results
Nationally, half of all women of reproductive age in 2014 
lived within 10·79 miles (17·36 km) of an abortion clinic 
(table). The median distance a woman would have had to 
travel to reach the nearest abortion clinic in 2014 was less 
than 15 miles (24 km) in 23 (46%) states (figure 1 and 
table). These states were located in all four geo 
graphical 
regions. Because we considered the concentration of 
residents in census block groups, many women in states 
with large rural populations would not have had to travel 
far to reach a clinic. For example, although a third of 
residents in Alaska live in rural areas,27 we found that half

of all women in this state lived within 9·31 miles 
(14·98 km) of the nearest abortion clinic.
The median distance to the nearest clinic providing 
abortion services in 2014 was 15–29 miles (24–47 km) in 
16 (32%) states and 30–89 miles (48–143 km) in eight 
(16%) states. At least half of all women in three (6%) 
states, including Wyoming (168·49 miles [271·16 km]), 
North Dakota (151·58 miles [243·94 km]), and South 
Dakota (92·06 miles [148·16 km]), would have had to 
travel more than 90 miles (145 km) to reach the nearest 
clinic.
The 
median 
state 
distances 
concealed 
sizable 
minorities of women who would have had to travel 
substantial distances to reach an abortion provider. For 
example, compared with the median distance of 
9·31 miles (14·98 km) in Alaska, the 80th percentile 
distance showed that 20% of women in Alaska would 
have had to travel at least 154·26 miles (248·26 km) to 
reach the nearest abortion clinic in 2014 (table). In 
26 (52%) states, at least 20% of women would have had to 
travel more than 50 miles (80 km) to reach the nearest 
facility providing abortion care.
Examining distance to the nearest clinic by county 
provided a more complex picture (figure 2). Substantially 
more variation was seen between counties than between 
states, and women in many counties had to travel 
considerably further than their state median distance. 
However, even in states such as Texas, in which most of 
the landmass was far from an abortion clinic, most 
women lived reasonably close to an abortion clinic 
because of the concentration of both women and clinics 
in urban areas (appendix).
Counties where women would have had to travel 
180 miles (290 km) or more to reach the nearest clinic 
were concentrated in the middle of the country, covering 
large portions of Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, 
South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, and Texas. There 
were also areas with large travel distances in some 
states bordering Canada (Minnesota and Michigan), as 
well as pockets in California, Nevada, Utah, Idaho, 
and Missouri. Although geographically sizable, most 
of these areas were not densely populated and 
were generally rural (appendix). However, several of them 
were located in or near to medium or small metropolitan 
areas, the largest of which were located in Texas: 
Corpus Christi (324 000 residents), Lubbock (246 000), 
Amarillo (199 000), and Brownsville (183 000).
Between 2011 and 2014, the median distance a woman 
would have had to travel to reach an abortion clinic 
decreased in nine [18%] states; remained stable, changing 
no more than 1 mile (1·6 km) in 34 (68%) states; and 
increased in seven [14%] states (table). Most of the 
changes in distance to the nearest clinic were 5 miles 
(8 km) or less. The exceptions were Kansas (73·54 miles 
[118·35 km]) and Maine (20·81 miles [33·49 km]), where 
the median distance decreased, and Montana (46·21 miles 
[74·37 km]), North Dakota (14·46 miles [23·27 km]), and 
Missouri (7·45 miles [11·99 km]), where the median 
distance increased.
Similarly, little to no change was seen in the median 
distance to the nearest clinic in most counties (figure 3). 
Counties where the median distance to the nearest 
provider increased by 30 miles (48 km) or more were 
especially prominent in Texas, Iowa, Montana, and 
Missouri, and were present only outside large 
metropolitan areas (appendix). Texas and Missouri also 
had the largest increases in the 80th percentile distance 
that 20% of women would have had to travel to reach a 
clinic (56·50 miles [90·93 km] for Texas and 26·76 miles

[43·07 km] for Missouri). Conversely, the 80th percentile 
distance  increased by less than 1 mile in Iowa, and the 
median distance actually decreased by 5·45 miles 
(8·77 km) in this state (table). Although counties where 
the median distance to the nearest provider increased by 
30 miles (48 km) or more were located in all four 
geographical regions, New Jersey was the only state in 
the northeast to show this degree of change. Counties 
where the median distance to a clinic increased by 
15–29 miles (24–47 km) were more sparse than those 
where the median distance to the nearest provider 
increased by 30 miles (48 km) or more, although they too 
were not found in large metropolitan areas (appendix). 
These counties were also scattered across all four regions, 
although only one state in the northeast, Virginia, 
experienced this level of decline in access.
Counties where the median distance to the nearest 
clinic decreased by more than 30 miles (48 km) were most 
commonly in the midwest, occurring in Illinois, Iowa, 
Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and Wisconsin. Distance to 
the nearest clinic also decreased by 30 miles (48 km) or 
more in counties in California and Colorado (in the west) 
and in Maine and upstate New York (in the northeast).
Our findings showed spatial disparities that were 
broadly unchanged in the period of 2011–14, despite 
several abortion restrictions being enacted during this 
period. We confirmed the consistency of the spatial 
disparities in our supplemental analysis of data 
from 2000. These spatial disparities have persisted for at 
least 15 years (appendix).
To assess the robustness of our results, we did a 
sensitivity analysis with inclusion of providers who did 
200–399 abortions each year. State distances in 2014 were 
almost identical to those from the original primary 
analysis, with one exception: in Texas, the 80th percentile 
distance increased by 30 miles (48 km) because of a 
restrictive law that forced clinic closures (appendix).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this study is the first to provide 
national estimates of spatial disparity in distance to the 
nearest abortion clinic for all women aged 15–44 years in 
the USA. Research has shown that living far from a 
provider can make abortion inaccessible.4–6 Travelling 
long distances can impose a substantial burden on 
women with respect to transportation costs, travel 
duration, time off work, and arrangement of childcare, 
particularly 
for 
women 
who 
are 
economically 
disadvantaged. However, distance can be contextualised 
within several factors that can affect access to abortion 
care. The presence of one nearby clinic does not 
necessarily show that the clinic meets the needs of all 
prospective patients, that it is open daily, or that it has the 
capacity to meet demand.28 Numerous barriers to access 
can have compounding effects on a woman’s ability to 
access care. For example, in 2014, 11 US states (an 
increase from nine states in 2011) required that a woman 
have in-person counselling, followed by waiting for 
24–72 h, before obtaining an abortion (appendix). For 
these women, even seemingly short distances of 30 miles 
(48 km) can pose a substantial barrier to care because 
they would have to travel to and from the clinic twice 
(120 miles [193 km] in total).
Almost all patients who have an abortion in the USA 
are economically disadvantaged, and many either do not 
have health insurance or are unable to use insurance to 
pay for the procedure.8 These women might be able to 
travel to an abortion clinic, but they will be unable to 
access the service if they cannot afford to pay for the 
procedure. Distance might compound these cost barriers.
Most women would not have to travel considerable 
distances to reach an abortion clinic because almost all 
women and providers in the USA are in metropolitan 
areas. However, a sizable minority of women would have 
to travel 90 miles or more, and variation between counties 
is greater than between states. For example, in Alaska 
in 2014, half of all women lived 9·31 miles (14·98 km) or 
less from an abortion clinic, but a fifth of women lived 
154·26 miles (248·26 km) or even further from a clinic; 
similar examples included Idaho, Montana, Nebraska, 
New Mexico, and Texas. Although half of all woman in 
the USA would have had to travel no more than 
10·79 miles (17·36 km) to reach the nearest abortion 
clinic, 20% of women would have had to travel 42·54 miles 
(68·46 km) or more. Although policies are implemented 
at the state level, the consequences of restrictive 
legislation might not be felt equally across counties 
within a state; women in rural counties are likely to be 
most adversely affected by clinic closures.

Increases in distance in excess of 30 miles (48 km) 
between 2011 and 2014 were particularly evident in 
numerous counties in Texas, Missouri, Iowa, and 
Montana. All of these states, except for Iowa, adopted 
abortion restrictions during this period (appendix). 
These states were among those that had the largest 
proportionate decline in clinics.17 A hostile environment 
might have contributed to clinic closures, meaning that 
more women would have had to travel further to access 
care in 2014 than in 2011. By contrast, Iowa enacted no 
major restrictions during the study period and was not 
considered hostile to abortion rights, although it had 
five fewer clinics in 2014 than in 2011 (appendix). 
Research has suggested that efforts to increase access to 
long-acting contraceptive methods in Iowa might have 
contributed to reductions in the number of abortions.29 
Reduced need for abortion services might have 
contributed to the decline in clinics and, in turn, the 
increase in distance that some women in some counties 
would have to travel for an abortion. The median distance 
to a clinic decreased by about 5 miles (8 km) for Iowa 
during the study period, suggesting that abortion services 
were redistributed and that women, particularly those 
living in metropolitan areas, would not have had to travel 
quite as far.
Texas was an outlier in that the distance that 20% of 
women would have had to travel increased by about 
56 miles (90 km). This finding was probably due to an 
abortion restriction enacted in 2013 requiring that 
physicians who provide abortion care have admitting 
privileges at nearby hospitals. This law resulted in the 
closure of more than half of the abortion care facilities in 
the state between 2013 and 2014.30 Our estimates of 
distance to nearest provider for women in Texas in 2014 
are probably too low because they were calculated with 
inclusion of facilities that provided at least 400 abortions 
in 2014, several of which were closed at some point that 
year.31 Although some of the more onerous restrictions 
were struck down by the Supreme Court in June, 2016, 
most clinics have not yet reopened,4 and the distance to 
the nearest provider has probably not improved.
The median distance to the nearest provider decreased 
by more than 20 miles (32 km) in Kansas and Maine. 
A new clinic opened in Kansas, and two clinics in Maine 
had increased caseloads so that they provided 400 or 
more abortions in 2014. These findings suggested that 
abortion might have become more accessible for women 
in these states.
This study had several limitations. First, there are 
numerous barriers to abortion access in the USA, and 
distance is not the only obstacle. Abortion restrictions, 
stigma, and financial constraints could prevent a woman 
from having an abortion, regardless of distance. Second, 
our estimates might be conservative because they do not 
capture the effect of mandated counselling and waiting 
periods, which might force women to make multiple 
trips to an abortion clinic. Third, a woman might not 
visit the closest abortion provider to her home; for 
example, the closest provider might not offer the 
necessary or desired services. Fourth, our analysis did 
not capture women’s qualitative experiences. Fifth, the 
inclusion criteria might have affected the measured 
distances, but modifying these criteria would have led to 
inclusion of locations that were not public points of 
access. Finally, although we documented spatial 
disparities, it was beyond the scope of our analysis to 
fully address their causal determinants (eg, reduced 
demand for services might have affected a clinic’s ability 
to support itself).
In conclusion, abortion is an important component of 
reproductive health, and restricting access to abortions 
can lead to them being done later or under potentially 
unsafe conditions. Our analysis showed substantial and 
persistent spatial disparities in access to abortion. 
Enacting restrictions at the state level is a stated priority 
of many policy makers.32 Such efforts, if successful, could 
not only reduce access to abortion, especially for 
economically disadvantaged women who might not have 
the resources to overcome obstacles posed by travel, but 
could potentially exacerbate existing spatial inequality.
