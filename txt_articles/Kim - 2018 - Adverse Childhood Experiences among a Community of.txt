The
Birch Lake  
photograph 
By Shenshen Dou, MS
Nature not only 
nurtures us, it eases 
our pain and heals our 
soul. This is a work 
from the artist’s “Man 
in Nature” photography 
art serial. In this image a girl playfully walks along a 
flowered trail beside a lake. The blurry reflection of the 
birch trees in the lake helps to fashion an illusory feel. 
Ms Dou worked as a molecular biologist and is an artist 
living in West Linn, OR. More of her work can be found 
in this and other issues of The Permanente Journal and

ORIGINAL RESEARCH 
& CONTRIBUTIONS
4 Low Cancer Risk of South Asians:  
A Brief Report. H Nicole Tran, MD, PhD; 
Natalia Udaltsova, PhD; Yan Li, MD, PhD; 
Arthur L Klatsky, MD
Logistic regression models were used to 
study cancer mortality through 2012 in 
273,843 persons (1117 South Asians: India, 
Pakistan, Bangladesh, or Sri Lanka) with 
baseline examination data from 1964-1985. 
Death was attributed to cancer in 28,031 
persons (1555 Asians, including 32 South 
Asians). The all-Asian vs white adjusted 
odds ratio was 1.0, and the South Asian vs 
white odds ratio was 0.5. In separate regres-
sions, South Asians were at lower risk than 
blacks, Chinese, Filipinos, Japanese, or 
other Asians. The South Asian-white dispar-
ity was concentrated in men.
9 Does a Relationship Exist Between 
Lower Body Power and Balance  
Scores Among Older Adults? 
Andrew Shim, EdD; Brady Harr, MS;  
Mike Waller, PhD
Falls are the second-leading cause of 
unintentional injury and death worldwide. 
All participants (13) were assessed stability 
scores via computerized posturography to 
determine center of pressure and limits of 
stability (LoS) balance scores. Participants 
stood on a perturbed surface with their eyes 
open and closed. Muscle power output and 
LoS scores have moderate to strong corre-
lations with balance scores in older adults.
13 Nerve Transfer Surgery for  
Penetrating Upper Extremity Injuries. 
Efstathios Karamanos, MD; Ilya Rakitin, MD; 
Sophie Dream, MD; Aamir Siddiqui, MD
The authors included cases (16 males, 
age 16-43 years) performed since 2006 
to repair penetrating trauma of upper 
extremities within 3 months of injury 
with at least 3 years’ of follow-up. Six 
patients underwent nerve transfer sur-
gery because of elbow flexion; 5, finger 
extension; 3, finger flexion; and 2, wrist 
pronation. Nine patients had associated 
vascular injury, and 4 had fractures. All 
patients improved from 0 of 5 muscle 
strength preoperatively to a mean of 3.8 
within 1 year after surgery, and in all 
cases strength was maintained.
17 Effects of Treatment-Associated 
Increases in Fruit and Vegetable Intake 
on the Consumption of Other Food 
Groups and Weight Through Self-
Regulatory Processes. 
James J Annesi, PhD, FAAHB, FTOS, FAPA
Women with obesity (N = 74, mean age 
= 47.7 years) participating in a yearlong 
behavioral weight-loss treatment plan 
were assessed regarding changes in 
consumption of various food groups, 
physical activity, and eating self-regulation. 
Fruits and vegetables (FV) intake change 
significantly predicted changes in weight 
and consumption of dairy and bread 
products and sweets. The only other 
notable relationships were among changes 
in sweets, bread, and dairy consumption 
over 24 months. During 6, 12, and 24 
months, changes in self-regulation 
significantly mediated the FV intake-
weight change relationship. A reciprocal 
relationship between changes in FV intake 
and self-regulation also was found.
21 Association of Psychiatric Diagnostic 
Conditions with Hospital Care Outcomes 
of Patients with Orthopedic Injuries 
Steven Schwartz, MD; Shahrzad 
Bazargan-Hejazi, PhD; Deyu Pan, MS; 
David Ruiz, MD; Anaheed Shirazi, MD; 
Eleby Washington, MD
From a retrospective analysis of patient 
discharge data from 507 California 
hospitals (2001 to 2010), the authors 
extracted psychiatric diagnoses, 
alcoholism, substance abuse, and 
sociodemographic characteristics. The 
entire injury admissions represented 
1.9% of hospital admissions and were 
predominantly older than age 64 years, 
white, and women with conventional 
health care insurance. The most common 
comorbidity was psychiatric illness 
(24.7%). Injury admissions with a 
psychiatric diagnosis had higher odds of 
a hospital stay of 7 or more days, 
surgical treatment complications, and 
inhospital death.
27 Barriers and Facilitators to the 
Deprescribing of Nonbenzodiazepine 
Sedative Medications Among Older 
Adults. Jennifer Kuntz, PhD; Louis Kouch, 
PharmD; Daniel Christian, PharmD; 
Preston L Peterson, MD; Inga Gruss, PhD
From the perspectives of patients, the 
greatest challenges to deprescribing are 
factors related to their insomnia; health 
care system factors, including a desire 
for personalized approaches to care; and 
their own positive personal experiences 
with sedative medication use. From the 
clinician perspective, a lack of institutional 
structures and resources to support 
deprescribing, the attitudes and practices 
of previous clinicians, and patient-related 
factors such as dependence and a lack 
of alternatives to treat insomnia were the 
most important barriers to deprescribing.

33 Adverse Childhood Experiences among 
a Community of Resilient Centenarians 
and Seniors: Implications for a Chronic 
Disease Prevention Framework. 
Rhonda Spencer-Hwang, DrPH; Xochitl 
Torres, MPH; Johanny Valladares, MBA; 
Marco Pasco-Rubio, MPH; Molly Dougherty; 
Wonha Kim, MD
In a qualitative study, centenarians and se-
niors in the Loma Linda Blue Zone (1 of 5 
worldwide longevity hotspots), childhood 
exposures and practices were assessed 
using focus groups and semistructured key 
informant interviews, and supplemented 
with lifestyle and resiliency factor ques-
tions. Participants (7 centenarians and 
29 seniors) reported exposure to multiple 
adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) 
(domains: economic deprivation, family 
dysfunction, and community violence). 
Community members reported practicing 
resiliency factors, each with anti-inflam-
matory properties suggesting mitigation of 
ACE-related toxic stress.
43 Diagnostic Pathway of Oral Cavity Cancer 
in an Integrated Health Care System. 
Kevin H Wang, MD; Brian H Song, MD; Jason 
E Gilde, MD; Jeanne A Darbinian, MPH; 
Miranda L Ritterman Weintraub, PhD, MPH; 
Tara J Wu, MD; Eleanor L Yang, MD; James 
W Salazar, MD; Deepak Gurushanthaiah, MD
In a retrospective study of 247 patients 
with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma 
(2007-2010), 167 (68%) had early-stage 
(I/II) disease, 86 (35%) were referred by 
dentists, and 70 (28%) had a history of pre-
malignancy. The median time from symptom 
onset to care sought from a primary care 
physician (patient interval), from primary 
care physician to otolaryngologist, and from 
otolaryngologist to diagnosis was 8.6, 1.0, 
0.0 weeks, respectively. These intervals did 
not differ by demographic characteristics, 
clinical factors, or tumor stage. Closer sur-
veillance may represent an opportunity for 
diagnosis at an earlier stage.
51 Naloxone Distribution and Training for 
Patients with High-Risk Opioid Use in 
a Veterans Affairs Community-Based 
Primary Care Clinic. Katie E Raffel, MD; 
Leila Y Beach, MD; John Lin, MD; Jacob E 
Berchuck, MD; Shelly Abram, LVN; Elizabeth 
Markle, PhD; Shalini Patel, MD
The quality improvement study was con-
ducted at an outpatient clinic serving 1238 
marginally housed veterans with high rates 
of comorbid substance use and mental 
health disorders identified using the Strati-
fication Tool for Opioid Risk Management. 
None of 67 patients had been prescribed 
naloxone at baseline. At end-of-interven-
tion (a one-on-one, 15-minute, hands-on 
naloxone training led primarily by licensed 
vocational nurses, 61 patients (69%) had 
been trained. This delivery model has the 
potential to provide access to naloxone 
to a population of patients with opioid use 
who may not be engaged in mental health 
or specialty care.

57 Abstracts from the Kaiser Permanente 
2018 National Quality Conference
Quality improvement (QI) activities are 
essential to create a learning health care

value, encourages greater rigor, and helps 
facilitate greater willingness to share im-
provement opportunities.
REVIEW ARTICLES
77 Refractory Hypoxemia in a Patient with 
Submassive Pulmonary Embolism and  
an Intracardiac Shunt: A Case Report  
and Review of the Literature. 
Jean Liew, MD; Janelle Stevens, DO;  
Christopher Slatore, MD, MS
The management of acute submassive 
pulmonary embolism is undertaken on an 
individualized basis because of the wide 
spectrum of clinical presentations. In this 
report the authors review the literature and 
discuss the evidence behind the manage-
ment of cases of acute pulmonary embolism 
complicated by hypoxemia from a patent 
foramen ovale. In a case of acute pulmonary 
embolism complicated by refractory hypox-
emia from an intracardiac shunt, adjunctive 
therapies in addition to anticoagulation and 
thrombolysis must be considered.
CASE REPORTS
84 Sinonasal Ewing Sarcoma: A Case Report 
and Literature Review. Jonathan K Lin, MD, 
MBA; Jonathan Liang, MD
Our literature review found more involve-
ment of the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses 
compared with the nasal cavity, and that 
the role of radiation and surgical approach 
was varied. Ewing Sarcoma of the sinona-
sal tract is a rare entity with high mortality, 
but few standardized treatment protocols 
exist. Further study and evidence-based 
treatment protocols are needed. This 
article outlines the role of relevant imaging, 
a multidisciplinary team approach, and the 
optimal timing of surgery, chemotherapy, 
and radiation.
Prevalence and Safety of Intravenous 
Immunoglobulin Administration During 
Maintenance Chemotherapy in Children 
with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia 
in First Complete Remission: A Health 
Maintenance Organization Perspective. 
Patrick Van Winkle, MD; Raoul Burchette, 
MA, MS; Raymond Kim, CCRP; Rukmani 
Raghunathan, MD; Naveen Qureshi, MD
Children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
(ALL) in first complete remission (CR1) ex-
perience hypogammaglobulinemia and are 
at risk of sepsis during maintenance chemo-
therapy. A multicenter, retrospective cohort 
study observed 118 consecutive children  
(9 months-19 years) with ALL in CR1 during 
maintenance chemotherapy from 2008 to 
2014. Groups treated with or without intrave-
nous immunoglobulin (IVIG) were compared 
using nonparametric statistics. Use of IVIG 
in children with hypogammaglobulinemia oc-
curred in approximately 30% of patients and 
was well tolerated.
Association of Inflammatory Markers  
with Disease Progression in Patients  
with Metastatic Melanoma Treated with  
Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors.  
Minggui Pan, MD, PhD; Mubarika Alavi, MS; 
Lisa J Herrinton, PhD
This retrospective cohort study included 108 
patients with malignant melanoma treated 
with an anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor from 
August 2014 through December 2015. 
The median time from initiating therapy 
to the end of follow-up was 118 days. For 
patients with metastatic melanoma treated 
with nivolumab or pembro-lizumab, higher 
neutrophil or platelet counts, or lower lym-
phocyte counts, are associated with higher 
risk of progression. The authors recommend 
more frequent assessment for progression 
and closer follow-up, especially for patients 
with substantial comorbidities or poor physi-
cal performance.
The Case for Including Adverse Childhood 
Experiences in Child Maltreatment 
Education: A Path Analysis. 
Michael Bachmann, PhD; Brittany A 
Bachmann, MA, MEd
Survey data examined the impact of child 
maltreatment education programs and 
knowledge about adverse childhood events 
(ACEs) on medical practitioners’ reporting 
habits and ability to detect maltreatment. 
The mediating variable “knowledge about 
ACEs” had the strongest structural effect 
on the number of Child Protective Services 
(CPS) referrals, almost twice as high as the 
second strongest effect of formal education 
programs. These practitioners were 
significantly more likely to recognize and to 
report abuse to CPS.

IMAGE DIAGNOSIS
 87 ECG Diagnosis: Accelerated Idioventricular 
Rhythm. Thomas H Gildea, MD; Joel T Levis, 
MD, PhD, FACEP, FAAEM
Accelerated idioventricular rhythm (AIVR) is a 
ventricular rhythm of three or more consecu-
tive monomorphic beats, with gradual onset 
and gradual termination. AIVR is usually seen 
during acute myocardial infarction reperfusion 
(following thrombolytic therapy or percutaneous 
coronary intervention), and rarely manifests in 
patients with completely normal hearts or with 
structural heart disease.
COMMENTARY
 90 Meditation and Mindfulness: A Call to  
Action in Elevating Primary Care. 
Ami Kapadia, MD
Mindfulness meditation has vast physiologic 
benefits that can reduce physician burnout 
and improve physician well-being. Collective 
meditation and mindfulness practices with 
organized continuity among physician groups 
can synergistically elevate the practice of pri-
mary care by fostering creativity and innovation 
needed for sustainable solutions. A cohesive 
frontline physician voice rooted in higher pur-
pose cultivated by meditation and mindfulness 
practices in a platform directly linked to quality 
improvement can lead to meaningful change in 
primary care for all.
NARRATIVE MEDICINE
 83 Blue Eyes. 
Patricia Lynes, RN
Unable to move his contractured body, he only 
communicated with his beautiful blue eyes. 
He would blink and squeeze your hand when 
you asked him if he wanted to go home. His 
doctors, therapists, and nurses had become 
his family.
 89 Nebraska Farm Scenes. 
Lisa Schuman, NP
It seemed as though her daughters, in sup-
pressing their angst over the death and dying 
of their mother, overshadowed the real patient. 
The girls, in their 60s, insisted that pictures of 
their dead father surround the patient’s head 
so that when she opened her eyes they would 
be all she would see. She wanted the pictures 
replaced with images of farmland and cattle.
 93 A Patient-Centered Approach to a Rural 
General Practice in Distress and the Search 
for a Solution. Venetia Young, MB, FRCOG, 
dipFT; Lewis Mehl-Madrona, MD, PhD;  
Barbara Mainguy, MA
A general practice in rural UK (Cumbria) was 
overwhelmed by staff burnout. The authors 
conducted an audit using the electronic health 
record for patients coming to the practice 5 or 
more times annually (2008-2012), and planned 
an intervention—genogram, psychoeducation, 
and up to six 30-minute sessions of solutions-
focused psychotherapy, in which difficult 
interpersonal relationships were identified 
and efforts made to resolve 1 major problem 
related to those relationships. The frequency of 
visits for patients with mental health conditions 
(41.0% of all frequent attenders in the practice) 
dropped significantly, and this intervention had 
beneficial impact on practitioners and improve-
ment in the morale of the staff.
 100 Fishbowl. 
Eileen Ogasawara-Chun, MD
I saw the head of the baby start to emerge, 
then I was guiding the baby out. “Hold tight. 
They’re slippery little devils.” I heard nothing 
then. No shouts of joy. No “It’s a boy! No crying 
of relief. “Then I felt a nudge. It was the attend-
ing. He said, “You don’t need to hold that tight; 
the kid’s got to breathe.”
 101 Implementing a Narrative Medicine Curricu-
lum During the Internship Year: An Internal 
Medicine Residency Program Experience. 
Tiffany Wesley, MD; Diana Hamer, PhD;  
George Karam, MD
Narrative medicine develops professional and 
communication skills that align with Accredita-
tion Council for Graduate Medical Education 
competencies. Six sessions, implemented 
throughout 1 academic year, expose first-year 
internal medicine residents (interns) to narra-
tive medicine. In total 17 interns attended at 
least 1 narrative medicine session; each ses-
sion averaged 5.4 attendees, and 13 eligible in-
terns completed the survey with 3 predominant 
themes: Mindfulness, physician well-being, 
and professionalism. This intervention demon-
strates the value of a narrative medicine cur-
riculum during medical resident training.
 105 Thoughts on Sexual Health. 
Kelly Isbill, DO
As a practicing obstetrician-gynecologist for 
more than 18 years, I have realized the impor-
tance of sexual health as well as the embar-
rassing lack of training in this very important 
part of our patients’ overall mental and physical 
health. If anyone should be expected to be not 
only comfortable but knowledgeable about sex, 
it should be us. Unfortunately, many of us had 
little or no education in sexual health during 
medical school or residency. I have been on a 
journey to educate myself so I might better help 
my patients.
 110 A View from the Other Side of the Consulta-
tion Desk. Sarah Nicole Dunkerley, BMBS, MA 
(Oxon), MRCS (Eng), PGCert (ME)
In this reflection on being both a physician and 
a patient, I consider the events that happened 
to me as a patient with cancer and how this will 
change my practice as a doctor in the future.

ABSTRACT
Context: South Asians (ancestry in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, or Sri Lanka) may have 
lower cancer risk than other racial-ethnic groups.
Objective: To supplement published cohort data suggesting low cancer risk in South 
Asians. 
Design: Logistic regression models with 7 covariates to study cancer mortality through 
2012 in 273,843 persons (1117 South Asians) with baseline examination data from 1964 
to 1985.
Main Outcome Measure: Cancer mortality. 
Results: Through 2012, death was attributed to cancer in 28,031 persons, of which 1555 
were Asians, including 32 South Asians. The all-Asian vs white adjusted odds ratio was 1.0, 
and the South Asian vs white odds ratio was 0.5 (p < 0.001). In separate regressions, South 
Asians were at lower risk than blacks, Chinese, Filipinos, Japanese, or other Asians. The South 
Asian-white disparity was concentrated in men but was generally similar when strata of 
smoking, body mass index, baseline age, and date of death were compared.
Conclusion: These data support the observation that compared with whites and other 
Asian groups, South Asians, especially men, have a lower risk of cancer.
INTRODUCTION
Studies of racial-ethnic disparities in 
cancer risk lead to greater understand-
ing of etiology and point out needs for 
targeted screening and education. Several 
reports suggest that South Asians, defined 
as persons with ancestry in India, Paki-
stan, Bangladesh, or Sri Lanka, may have 
lower cancer risk than other racial-ethnic 
groups.1-6 Our recent incidence study in 
124,193 persons confirmed this and sug-
gested that South Asians may have lower 
cancer risk than any other US racial-ethnic 
group.7 Hoping to cast more light on this, 
we expanded our study cohort to 273,843 
persons and report here an analysis of 
28,913 deaths attributed to cancer. 
METHODS
Subjects and Data
The institutional review board of Kaiser 
Permanente approved the study proto-
cols. Subjects were 273,843 persons with 
available detailed racial classification who 
underwent health examinations offered 
by a comprehensive Northern California 
Health Plan. Taken as a voluntary health 
appraisal, the examination included health 
measurements and queries about sociode-
mographic status, habits, and medical his-
tory.8 As previously described,9 detailed 
racial classification was available for 2 time 
intervals: 1964 to 1973 and 1978 to 1985. 
For persons with multiple examinations, 
baseline data from the first examination 
were used. 
Mortality Ascertainment
We followed subjects through De-
cember 2012 using an automated match-
ing system10 that ascertained deaths in 
California. Presumption of complete 
follow-up yielded a calculated 8,215,000 
person-years of follow-up, but estimates11 
suggest a sensitivity of 89% for the method 
used. The match found 28,913 deaths at-
tributed to cancer. We accepted primary 
International Classification of Diseases, 
Ninth Revision death certificate codes, 
converting from Eighth Revision codes 
when necessary. Tables 1 a and b present 
race/ethnicity distributions. 
We used logistic regression with 8 
covariates, including sex, race, education, 
marital status, smoking, alcohol habit, and 
body mass index (BMI). Race/ethnicity 
was studied primarily with whites as the 
referent in 2 sets of models: 1) blacks, all 
Asians, and others (not white, black, or 
Asian) and 2) blacks, Chinese, Japanese, 
Filipinos, South Asians, other Asians, 
and others. Interethnic Asian comparisons 
were studied by models using Chinese, 
Filipinos, Japanese, or other Asians as 
referents.
We studied total cancer and specific 
cancer types in all persons, year-of-death 
endpoints, and stratified by sex, race/
ethnicity, BMI, and smoking. We present 
odds ratios (ORs), 95% confidence inter-
vals (CIs), and associated p values. 
RESULTS
Tables 1 a and b show that deaths result-
ing from cancer made up approximately 
25% of all deaths and occurred at a slightly 
younger age than the average age for all 
deaths. Ethnic differences in mean age 
of any death and cancer death seemed to 
parallel the differences in mean baseline 
age, with South Asians the youngest (32.2 
years at baseline) and whites the oldest 
(38.2 years at baseline). The unadjusted 
differences in cancer deaths per 1000 sub-
jects, from 29.1 in South Asians to 107.6 
in whites, are noteworthy. 
In adjusted models, compared with 
whites, Asians as a composite had similar 
cancer mortality risk (Table 2). In models 
including both sexes with whites as the 
referent, Chinese had slightly higher risk, 
Japanese and other Asians had similar 
risk, Filipinos had slightly lower risk, and 
South Asians had substantially lower risk 
(OR = 0.5, CI = 0.3-0.7, p < 0.001). For the 
South Asians vs whites comparison, the OR 
in men was 0.4 (CI = 0.2-0.6, p < 0.001) and 
in women was 0.8 (CI = 0.5-1.3, p = 0.4).

Low Cancer Risk of South Asians: A Brief Report
between Asian ethnic groups (Table 2). 
Compared with Chinese, Japanese sub-
jects had similar risk, whereas Filipinos, 
South Asians, and other Asians had 
lower risk. Compared with Filipinos, 
Japanese subjects had higher risk and 
South Asians had lower risk. Compared 
with Japanese subjects, Filipinos and 
South Asians had lower risk. Compared 
with other Asians, only South Asians 
had lower risk.
The lower risk of South Asians was 
generally consistent in models stratified 
by smoking, baseline age, and BMI, and 
in year-of-death endpoints (Table 3). A 
model that omitted the 378 deaths attrib-
uted to skin cancer showed a similar low 
risk for South Asians (Table 3). 
Table 4 presents ORs of South Asians 
to whites and to Chinese (the largest 
Asian group) for risk of death attributed 
to the 10 most common cancer types 
in the analysis. These types constituted 
77.7% of all cancer deaths (81.3% among 
South Asians). With small numbers of 
South Asian cases and wide CIs, few 
ORs showed p values less than 0.05, but

Low Cancer Risk of South Asians: A Brief Report
9 of the 10 South Asian-white or South 
Asian-Chinese comparisons in men had 
either an OR below 1.0 or no South Asian 
cases. Among women, 8 of the 10 cancer 
types had no cases or an OR below 1.0 for 
either set of comparisons.
DISCUSSION
Our finding of reduced cancer risk in 
South Asians aligns with sparse previous 
reports.1-6 In a study of cancer incidence 
among Asian Indians or South Asians in 
India, Singapore, the UK and the US, the 
lowest total cancer incidence rates were 
observed in India and the highest in US 
whites.6 Cancer incidence rates among 
Indians residing outside India were in-
termediate, leading to the conclusion that 
overseas South Asians appeared to adopt 
the cancer patterns of their host coun-
try. In another analysis, Mangtani et al2 
compared ethnic South Asian immigrants 
in England and Wales with non-South 
Asian first-generation immigrants; all-
cancer rates in ethnic South Asians were 
half those in other immigrant groups. A 
longer-term study of cancer incidence in 
South Asian migrants to England from 
1986 to 2004 showed that overall, age-
adjusted cancer incidence in South Asians 
was half that in non-South Asians but 
rose over time.4 The authors concluded 
that “although still lower than in non-
South Asians, cancer incidence is rising 
in South Asians, supporting the concept 
of transition in cancer incidence among 
South Asians living in England.” In a 
later study, Maringe et al3 reported that 
although the survival advantage of South 
Asians tended to narrow for some cancer 
types over time, it remained present for 
colorectal, liver, and lung cancers in men. 
Comparing Asian Indians/Pakistanis 
with white Americans, Goggins and 
Wong1 reported low cancer incidence 
and generally above-average survival in 
South Asians; standardized incidence 
ratios in men and women were 0.46 
(95% CI = 0.44-0.48), and 0.55 (95% 
CI = 0.53-0.58), respectively. In a report 
based on racial-ethnic classification from 
the US 2000 census, Miller et al5 showed 
in 7 Asian ethnic groups that cancer in-
cidence and mortality rates were lowest 
among Asian Indian/Pakistani and Gua-
manian men and women.

CI = confidence interval; SA = South Asians.
Our 2016 report of cancer inci-
dence in Asian Americans in California 
showed that adjusted ORs among South 
Asians vs whites for any cancer were 0.5 
(CI = 0.4-0.7, p = 0.002) in men and 0.6 
(CI = 0.3-0.9, p = 0.02) in women.7 That 
analysis confirmed the established higher 
Asian/White risk of stomach, liver, and 
cervical cancer and lung adenocarcinoma.7 
However, South Asians had no signifi-
cantly increased risk for these cancer types 
in either the incidence data7 or the present 
mortality study. South Asians had slightly 
increased risk of incident upper airway 
and digestive tract cancers in men and 
ovarian cancer in women,7 but mortality 
data in Table 4 do not show these associa-
tions. In both reports, most Asian groups, 
including South Asians, had lower risk of 
melanoma, bladder cancer, and malignant 
glioma (data not shown). In both analyses, 
the numbers of South Asian cases were 
insufficient for stable risk estimates for 
individual cancer types. 
The lower total cancer risk among 
South Asians (Table 2) included con-
tributions from several common specific 
cancer types (Table 4). Consistency in 
strata (Table 3) added to the validity of 
the finding. Although South 
Asians in this study population 
had a relatively low prevalence 
of smoking,12 their lowered 
cancer risk compared with 
whites in never smokers was 
similar to that in other smok-
ing subgroups. The persistence 
of South Asians’ lower cancer 
risk in the later years of follow-
up (Table 3) as well as the prior 
reports across different geographic re-
gions support the validity of our findings.
Hypothetical explanations for low 
cancer risk in South Asians are all specu-
lative, but an interplay of genetic and en-
vironmental factors seems likely. There are 
reports of distributions favorable to South 
Asians of genetic mutations associated 
with decreased risk of certain cancers. 
Examples are lower prevalence of BRCA2 
than BRCA1 mutations in several Indian 
studies13 for breast cancer and polymor-
phism at GSTM1 and GSTP1 gene loci 
for prostate cancer.14 South Asians appear 
to have a high prevalence of polymor-
phisms in DNA repair systems XRCC1 
and XPD, which aid in DNA repair and 
reduce cancer susceptibility.15 Speculation 
about environmental contrib-
utors include low tobacco and 
alcohol use,12 plus favorable 
dietary practices, such as veg-
etarianism and use of turmeric 
(curcumin), other spices, and 
food additives.16 A relatively 
high use of screening behav-
iors and access to care have 
also been cited.3,6 In our study 
population, South Asians 
were a highly educated and scientifically 
sophisticated group, making adherence 
to healthy lifestyle practices a plausible 
factor in their reduced cancer risk. 
In addition to small numbers of can-
cers in South Asians, limitations of our 
analyses include an absence of data about 
diet and other potential lifestyle factors, 
and use of only baseline measurements. 
Strengths include the size of the total 
study cohort, the long follow-up, and 
control for several potential confound-
ers. Our findings do not point to any 
specific recommendations for public 
health measures, but we hope that our 
report will stimulate research that may 
lead to interventions that might reduce 
cancer incidence.

ABSTRACT
Context: Falls are the second-leading cause of unintentional 
injury and death worldwide. 
Objective: To determine if a relationship exists between lower 
body power scores and center of pressure (CoP) and limits of 
stability (LoS) scores. 
Methods: A one-shot case study design (n = 13) was selected 
for the investigation. All participants were assessed stability scores 
via computerized posturography to determine CoP and LoS bal-
ance scores. Participants stood on a perturbed surface with their 
eyes open and closed. An experimental stair ramp with a switch 
mat timing device was used to determine lower body power 
scores in watts. 
Results: There was a strong correlation (r = 0.725, p = 0.005) 
between the posterior (LoS) plane and relative peak power. An 
intraclass R revealed a strong correlation among the three trials 
(R = 0.831) performed on the stair ramp. 
Conclusion: Muscle power output and LoS scores have mod-
erate to strong correlations with balance scores in older adults.
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
The US senior population is expected to double by 2050, 
as life expectancy improves with advances in medical care 
and pharmacology.1 Along with extended longevity, however, 
functional issues can negatively influence quality of life for 
elderly people.
Falls are the leading cause of fatal and nonfatal injuries for 
older Americans.2 One group of investigators discovered that 
medical costs associated with fatal and nonfatal falls totaled 
$19.2 billion in 2006, with injuries ranging from hip fractures 
to traumatic brain injuries.2 Research now considers factors 
that may diminish a person’s ability to perform activities of 
daily living (ADLs). ADLs are daily tasks a person must be 
able to perform such as locomotion and feeding. Multiple and 
complex variables are involved with predicting the circum-
stances under which older adults may fall, which increases the 
difficulty associated with developing a care plan.
Research demonstrates that balance and strength are im-
portant for fall prevention, but few studies have focused on 
the importance of muscle power output.3 Power is defined as 
the measurement of force times distance over time compared 
with strength, which is a concept of maximal force produc-
tion.4 Leg power is a stronger predictor in self-reported ADL 
functionality in older women in relation to other measure-
ments such as peak oxygen consumption, leg strength, chest 
press strength, and upper back power.5 Similar results were 
noted in a study performed on nonagenarian adults that 
identified muscle power output as a factor in gait variability.6 
Investigators in a 2002 study noted that women with a his-
tory of falls were 24% less powerful than their peers who had 
not sustained falls.7 Initial studies focusing on generational 
differences among men revealed an 8.3% decrease in maximal 
anaerobic power per decade.8 A reduction in muscle power 
wattage in comparison to strength has been identified in people 
ages 65 to 89 years.9 Evidence suggests that muscle power out-
put may influence fall likelihood and should be considered in 
addition to strength training.5,10 The ability to predict muscle 
power output should help to forecast functional decline in 
ADLs and loss of independence in elderly patients.10
Although muscle power output is an important factor in fall 
prevention, testing this variable in older adults has presented 
challenges. Many testing options, including the five-times-sit-
to-stand test, stair walk tests, stand-up-and-go tests, and vertical 
jumping are available to assess muscle power output.11 However, 
available tests may be dangerous, expensive, or inapplicable for 
the elderly population. One of the most effective tests for muscle 
power assessment is the Margaria-Kalamen test,12 which was 
designed for athletic people who can escalate 12 steps with the 
highest possible velocity. Although the Margaria-Kalamen test 
can reliably assess leg muscle power output, performing the 
required task is risky for older participants. Signorile et al13 cre-
ated a valid alternative for older people that used a ramp rather 
than a staircase, and this test allowed for improved safety and 
reliability when working with elderly patients. Shim and Drum4 
made further changes to the ramp to simulate real-life stairs 
by adding steps, side rails, and a back rail on the top platform. 
Researchers noted that the modified lower body power output 
test with the stair ramp was a valid and reliable replacement 
for the Margaria-Kalamen test.4 
Clinicians can use other assessment methods to evaluate fall 
risks in older people. Center of Pressure (CoP) testing, which 
involves body pressure via the soles of the feet concentrated 
in one location, is becoming popular with older adults. A 
potential benefit associated with multifactorial CoP testing 
is the ability to observe numerous variables to elucidate the 
relationship between muscle power and CoP measurements.

Does a Relationship Exist Between Lower Body Power and Balance Scores Among Older Adults? 
There is a void in the literature regarding the relationship be-
tween lower body muscle power output and balance. 
The purpose of this study was to observe if a relationship 
exists between lower leg muscle power output and CoP and 
Limits of Stability (LoS) measurements through use of a com-
puterized posturography plate. 
DESIGN AND METHODS
Qualified volunteers (n = 13) who were readily available from 
an independent senior citizen center in Sioux City, IA, were 
selected for this study. Participants were age 60 years and older. 
All participants lived independently, completed a general health 
questionnaire, provided informed consent, did not have vertigo 
or other diagnoses that could interfere with balance, and did not 
take medication that can cause dizziness. Those who had medi-
cal contraindications or missed their appointment times were 
excluded from the study. The project was approved by Briar Cliff 
University’s institutional review board (Sioux City, IA) before the 
participants were recruited. 
Muscle power output and balance testing took place at the 
senior center on the same day. The experimental stair ramp was 
placed on level, nonslip flooring. Before the testing, participants 
performed a specific neuromuscular warm-up by practicing on the 
ramp for several minutes. After the warm-up was complete, each 
participant was given directions to line up 3 meters away from 
the power ramp. Each participant ascended the ramp as quickly 
as possible. Lafayette Instruments (Lafayette, IN) switch mats 
were interfaced to an official timing device that was accurate to 
0.001 second. Each switch mat was placed at the first and third 
ramp steps to start and stop the timing device once foot pressure 
was detected. Times were recorded to the nearest 0.01 second. 
Coaching was initiated to remind participants to step on each 
sensor to ensure accuracy. Each participant completed the test 3 
times; a 2- to 3-minute rest period was provided between each 
trial to restore adenosine triphosphate and allow full recovery. 
Participants were not allowed to use handrails to help them 
ascend the ramp.
After lower leg muscle power output was completed, the bal-
ance tests were conducted in a private room. A computerized 
posturography plate (BalanceCheck System, Bertec Inc, Co-
lumbus, OH) was used to determine balance scores, which also 
calculated body mass index. Stability can be assessed by measuring 
changes in CoP scores on a force plate or posturography plate. 
Each participant was given five tests: Static stability with eyes 
open, static stability with eyes closed, perturbed stability with 
eyes open, perturbed stability with eyes closed, and LoS in four 
different planes. LoS is the distance to which a person can lean 
without losing balance. People with decreased levels of LoS are 
at higher risk for falls attributed to lack of cognitive readiness 
to make adjustments to their base of support. Participants were 
asked to stand on the plate for ten seconds for each test while 
the computer measured postural sway. They were coached to relax 
while standing on the plate and minimize unnecessary move-
ments, including gestures, turning, or talking. 
Participants stood on a foam labile pad with their eyes 
open during perturbed stability testing. They were coached 
to stand as still as possible and reduce unnecessary gestures, 
talking, or turning. After the eyes-open test, each participant 
performed the same protocol on the perturbed surface with 
their eyes closed. 
The LoS test performed with the BalanceCheck was next. 
Participants remained on the perturbed surface with their feet 
centered in the middle of the force plate. The researcher reminded 
participants to reduce all unnecessary gestures, talking, and turn-
ing. Once testing began, the participant was asked to lean as far 
forward, backward, left, and right as possible with their eyes fully 
open without losing balance to measure maximal range in the 
frontal and sagittal planes. Data were collected and evaluated with 
SPSS Version 22 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). A Pearson product 
moment correlation was used to view the relationship between 
lower body muscle power output from the ramp and CoP and 
LoS scores. An intraclass correlation was used to measure reli-
ability of measurements from the power ramp.
RESULTS
LoS testing revealed a strong correlation (r = 0.725, p = 0.005) 
between posterior plane scores and relative peak power as shown 
in Figure 1. LoS posterior scores also moderately correlated 
(r = 0.680, p = 0.011) with relative average power (Figure 2). 
LoS anterior scores correlated with both LoS left (r = 0.746, 
p = 0.003) and LoS right (r = 0.759, p = 0.003) scores as shown 
in Figures 3 and 4, respectively. No significant correlations were 
found between power output measurements and CoP. An intra-
class correlation between trials ran on the power ramp revealed 
a strong correlation (r = 0.831).
DISCUSSION 
In 2012, investigators demonstrated that lower body muscle 
power output is a proximal determinant of falls and functional 
limitations in adults age 60 years and older.14 The World Health 
Organization defined a fall as “inadvertently coming to rest on the 
ground, floor or other lower level, excluding intentional change in 
position to rest in furniture, wall or other subjects.”15 The ability 
to predict falls and improve functionality in this growing popula-
tion will help to sustain quality of life and improve the economic 
impact associated with care of this population. Between 2012 
and 2050, the US population of those age 65 years and older is 
projected to increase from 43.1 million to 83.7 million.1 On the 
basis of the number of people living beyond age 65, and without 
any positive interventions in place, longevity itself will place a 
large burden on tax dollars and medical care if injury rates at-
tributable to falls continue on the current trajectory. 
About one-third of adults age 65 years and older will sustain a 
fall within a single year.16 Among these falls, 800,000 will result 
in hospitalization with an injury.17 Falls are likely to result in frac-
tures or other injuries for older adults.17 Accounting for inflation, 
fatal and nonfatal fall-associated medical costs are projected to 
reach $637.5 million and $31.3 billion, respectively, in 2015.18 
When researching primary care in the UK, investigators noted in 
a longitudinal cohort study that death risk at 1 year and 3 years 
was increased for recurrent elderly people who fall.16 Among 
people ages 75 and older, people who fall are 4 to 5 times more

likely to be placed in a long-term care facility for the rest of their 
lives than those who do not.16 
Much current and past research has examined the effects 
of strength on fall prevention. In 2005, Hess and Woollacott3 
reviewed the effects of high-intensity strength training on 
functional measures of balance. Their study revealed that high-
intensity strength training can effectively strengthen lower 
extremity muscles in balance-impaired older adults, resulting 
in major improvements in stability and functional movement. 
Pretest-posttest results from this study showed significant chang-
es in quadricep, hamstring, tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius 
strength (p ≤ 0.001). The only correlation between functional 
balance scores and strength was between gastrocnemius one-
repetition-maximum strength change and Berg Balance Scale 
scores (r = -0.683). Chandak et al,19 who studied correlations 
between isometric muscle strength and balance performance in 
elderly women, assessed isometric strength of hip flexors, exten-
sors, abductors, and adductors. Knee flexors and extensors and 
ankle plantar and dorsiflexors were tested as well. Participants’ 
knee extensor findings correlated more strongly with balance 
than other measured musculatures. This study demonstrated 
that participants with good knee extensor strength had higher 
stability scores. These findings explain the authors’ focus beyond 
lower body strength. On the basis of our results, the primary 
investigators would have concluded similar results as seen in 
Hess and Woollacott’s3 and Chandak et al’s19 studies if the mea-
sured variables were replicated. In 2012, investigators observed 
strength measurements using the chair-stand test and stability 
index measurements.20 This study showed a negative moderate 
correlation between strength and stability index scores (r = -0.576, 
p < 0.01). On the basis of past research, this study’s investigators 
had expected to find a negative relationship between CoP scores 
and lower body wattage.20 However, our significant results do 
not reveal a negative correlation attributable to variables such 
as LoS scores, which improved in the posterior plane as power 
output increased in all participants. 
Intraclass correlation testing demonstrated that the stair ramp 
power test is a reliable assessment of lower power in older adults 
(r = 0.831). Shim and Drum4 produced similar results when us-
ing the ramp with younger adults (r = 0.995). Their study also 
revealed that the ramp test was an adequate replacement for the 
Margaria-Kalamen test (r = 0.861). Signorile et al13 developed the 
ramp by decreasing the angle to a ratio of 1:12 rise/run to increase 
accessibility for more elderly people and simulate standard access 
ramps. In 1989, investigators contended that the ramp method 
removed the skill component of stair running, further increas-
ing muscle power output observed in testing.21 This viewpoint 
may help to ease the fears of elderly patients who participate in 
power assessments. Safety rails and steps were added by Shim 
and Drum4 and were very useful when testing older adults.

Does a Relationship Exist Between Lower Body Power and Balance Scores Among Older Adults? 
Of 13 participants, only two required 
rails on the top platform to help them 
reduce speed upon completion, and only 
one participant needed support while 
ascending the ramp.4 This trial was 
meaningful because it gave clinicians 
the opportunity to assist participants 
and show them the safety features of the 
ramp. When working with the elderly 
population, use of top rails to assist with 
speed reduction is rarely seen, however.
When observing correlations be-
tween LoS scores and lower body muscle power ramp outputs, 
our results reveal strong to moderate correlations between LoS 
posterior and relative peak power and relative average power. A 
high correlation between these variables may be attributable to 
testing of posterior chain muscles with the stair ramp test, which 
also could be involved with balance. Relative peak power and 
relative average scores produced much higher correlations (r = 
0.725 and r = 0.680, respectively), indicating that power may be 
a better predictor than strength toward improving balance than 
seen in previous studies.19,20 Power scores with LoS posterior 
scores produced higher correlations than previous studies.19,20,22 
LoS anterior scores correlated highly with both LoS right (r 
= 0.759, p = 0.003) and LoS left (r = 0.746, p = 0.003) scores. 
Although investigators did not look at posture as a factor in this 
study, posture shifts in the anterior plane may be responsible for 
this correlation. Rolled shoulders, a flexed thoracic spine, and a 
forward head more anteriorly may have contributed to the higher 
correlations of movement in the left and right plane movements. 
Study limitations included the time of day the assessments were 
held; study sample size; and competing activities that were not 
originally scheduled at the senior center on the testing day, which 
reduced our sample size.
CONCLUSION
Muscle power output and LoS scores moderately to strongly 
correlate with balance scores in older adults. Further studies 
involving these variables such as receiver operating character-
istic analysis for specificity and sensitivity should be considered 
for power ramp use to determine the ability to detect fall risk. 
Specific power training for older adults also should be studied. 
Our near-future goal is to use muscle power ramp test findings 
to identify at-risk adults and lower their likelihood for falls. v

ABSTRACT
Context: Nerve transfer surgery is an option for repair of pen-
etrating injuries of the upper extremity. In the right setting, it has 
advantages over tendon transfers and nerve grafting. 
Objective: To review our experience since 2006 of nerve transfer 
surgery in the upper extremities. 
Design: We included cases performed to repair penetrating 
trauma within three months of injury with at least three years’ 
follow-up. 
Main Outcome Measures: Preoperative and postoperative 
muscle strength of the affected extremity.
Results: All 16 patients were males aged 16 to 43 years. Six pa-
tients underwent nerve transfer surgery because of elbow flexion; 
5, finger extension; 3, finger flexion; and 2, wrist pronation. Nine 
patients (56%) had associated vascular injury, and 4 (25%) had 
fractures. Average follow-up was 6 years. No perioperative compli-
cations occurred. Patients had a mean of 3.7 operations after the 
initial trauma. All patients received physical therapy. All patients 
improved from 0 of 5 muscle strength preoperatively to a mean 
of 3.8 (range = 2/5 to 5/5) within 1 year after surgery. In all cases, 
strength was maintained, and 8 (50%) had continued improvement 
after Year 1. Ten (63%) returned to their previous employment level. 
Mean Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score improved 
from 68 to 83 postoperatively.
Conclusion: Nerve transfer is a safe, effective technique for 
correcting penetrating trauma-related nerve injury. In appropriate 
patients it offers advantages over other techniques. Outcomes can 
be maintained long term, and many patients can return to their 
previous level of function.
INTRODUCTION
In traumatic peripheral nerve injury of the upper extremity, 
clinical outcomes with typical techniques, including tendon trans-
fer and nerve grafting, are inconsistent and prone to suboptimal 
outcomes.1,2 Zone of injury, concomitant injuries, donor site mor-
bidity, and need for staged procedures can all affect the outcome. 
Major drawbacks of the current treatment strategies can include 
delayed reinnervation for high injuries requiring nerve grafts, do-
nor morbidity for tendon transfers and autologous nerve grafts, 
and prolonged reliance on trained therapists for good outcomes. 
Nerve transfer surgery involves taking nerve branches from a 
neighboring nerve and redirecting them to the distal end of the 
injured nerve. Functioning branches close to the recipient non-
functioning nerve are ideal donors as long as the donor nerve 
function is redundant or less critical. The body then regenerates 
axons along the new path, and the motor cortex subsequently 
rewires itself to relearn muscle functions. This technique provides 
a nearby source of nerve for faster recovery because the healing 
and regeneration is occurring closer to the target site along the 
course of the recipient nerve. 
Nerve transfer surgery has the potential to address many of 
the weaknesses of other surgical options. This study outlines our 
experience and results with nerve transfer surgery for repair of 
upper extremity penetrating nerve injuries. 
METHODS
After institutional review board approval, a retrospective re-
view was performed of all patients admitted to a Level I urban 
trauma center with penetrating injury to the upper extremities 
from January 2004 to December 2011 undergoing nerve transfer 
for repair of nerve injury. Inclusion criteria included penetrating 
injury to the upper extremities with subsequent sensorimotor 
deficit secondary to nerve injury, operative intervention within 
three months of initial presentation, and follow-up of at least 
three years after the initial operation. 
Abstracted patient variables included age, sex, indication for 
surgery, the presence of associated vascular or osseous injury, 
follow-up duration, number of operations, and any periopera-
tive complications. Primary outcome included preoperative and 
postoperative muscle strength of the extremity using the Oxford 
Scale.3 Secondary outcomes included the Disabilities of the Arm, 
Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score and surgical complications. 
The DASH score is an outcome measure that is scored in 2 
components: The disability/symptom section (scored 1-5) and 
the optional high performance Sport/Music or Work section 
(scored 1-5).4,5
RESULTS
During the study period, 16 patients underwent nerve trans-
fer for repair of penetrating upper extremity injury. The patients 
identified were all males, with a mean age of 27 years (range = 
16-43 years). Of the 16 cases of nerve transfer, 6 were caused by 
loss of elbow flexion, 5 were for loss of finger extension, 3 were 
caused by loss of finger flexion, and the remaining 2 for loss of 
wrist pronation. Associated vascular injury was encountered in 9 
patients, and 4 patients had an associated osseous injury (Table 1). 
The mean follow-up was 6 years, and the median number of sur-
geries required was 4 (range = 2-5). No perioperative complica-
tions were encountered.

Muscle strength of the affected extremity was checked pre-
operatively. All patients had 0 of 5 strength for the function 
in question, with 0 indicating no contraction and 5 indicating 
movement against gravity with full resistance (normal power). 
Muscle strength was reassessed at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 
and then annually. The median postoperative muscle strength at 
1 year after surgery was 4/5, with a range of 2/5 to 5/5 (p < 0.05). 
All patients were followed for at least 3 years. Fifty percent of 
patients (8/16) maintained the same level of strength at 3 years 
that they had at the 1-year mark. The other 50% experienced im-
provement of their strength level from Year 1 to Year 3. No patient 
had deterioration in strength level after the first year (Table 2), 
and 10 of the 16 patients were able to return to their previous 
level of employment. When the DASH score was calculated 
for each patient preoperatively and postoperatively, a significant 
increase postoperatively was noted (score of 68 preoperatively vs 
83 postoperatively, p < 0.05 respectively, Table 2). 
Table 3 depicts the type of operation performed for every 
patient depending on his functional loss. The Modified British 
Medical Research Council Classification for muscle strength was 
documented preoperatively as well as at 3 years postoperatively. 
DISCUSSION
In terms of traumatic sequelae of a penetrating injury to the 
extremities, nerve injury is of particular importance. Unlike with 
many other injuries, timely, good surgical technique is not the 
only predictor of outcome. Direct nerve repair of a proximal 
nerve injury can take months or years to produce good results. 
The disability can become permanent. Surgeons have developed 
ancillary procedures designed to correct the deficit by using other 
functioning neuromuscular or neurosensory units. The growing 
list of techniques includes nerve grafting (via autologous grafts, 
allogeneic grafts, or synthetic conduits), tendon transfer, nerve 
transfer, joint fusion, and adaptive splinting. Nerve transfer is a 
newer concept that involves redirecting a nerve segment from 
a neighboring noncritical or redundant branching nerve to the 
distal edge of the injured nerve (Figure 1). 
Nerve grafting is employed to bridge gaps when primary re-
pair of a transected nerve cannot be performed without tension 
or scarring. Even with excellent technique, the nerve regenera-
tion length is unchanged and the biology of nerve regeneration 
(1 mm/d) remains the rate-limiting step.6 The number of axons 
that make it to the end organ is always reduced.7 Grafting also 
means 2 coaptations and successful healing at both sites. The 
outcome is a decrease in the quantity and eventual quality of the 
neuromotor unit by the time the regeneration is complete. During 
nerve grafting, the entire donor nerve domain, usually sensory, 
is lost. Nerve conduits and allografts decrease donor site impact 
but have not been shown to improve the clinical outcomes over 
nerve grafting.8-10
Many surgeons treating patients with nerve injuries prefer 
tendon transfers. For adept surgeons, the results are predictable. 
In most cases, tendon transfers are irreversible. They require the 
sacrifice of a neuromuscular unit; alteration of biomechanics, 
which can result in secondary trauma remote from the original 
injury; and the need for therapy and retraining.11,12 Because of the 
rerouting required for tendon transfer, there is almost universally 
a drop-off in strength and mobility after transfer.12
Nerve transfer may be superior to nerve grafting because the 
surgical field during transfer is generally away from the site of 
injury, using healthy, recognizable tissues, instead of crushed or

Nerve Transfer Surgery for Penetrating Upper Extremity Injuries
scarred tissue found at the site of injury. Despite recent improve-
ments and use of grafts, nerve grafting continues to have a poor 
prognosis.13 It is for this reason that the focus of nerve repair 
has shifted toward the technique of nerve transfer. Results of 
the present study show that nerve transfer can achieve higher 
functional results and more predictable outcomes over those 
typically obtained with nerve grafting. 
Compared with tendon transfer, nerve transfer has been shown 
to have several advantages. Nerve transfers are performed outside 
the zone of the original injury using healthy, recognizable tissues, 
instead of crushed or scarred nerve tissue. Nerve transfer allows 
reinnervation of native muscle and preservation of the natural 
anatomy. This is beneficial, because it does not alter the biome-
chanics, which can decrease range of motion, restrict muscle or 
tendon gliding, or cause secondary trauma such as adhesions 
or tendon rupture. Additionally, tendon transfer may require 
extensive dissection, and precluding this dissection with nerve 
transfer may lead to less donor site morbidity. Nerve transfers 
occur closer to the motor endplate, resulting in shorter inter-
val to reanimation and less loss of functional motor units.14 In 
theory, this can improve detailed nerve function, including fine 
and gross motor function, as well as sensation. Details of cur-
rent practices in nerve transfer for sensation are outlined in an 
article by Boyd et al.15 
Nerve transfers do have some disadvantages. The clinical results 
of a nerve transfer, unlike tendon transfer, do take months to 
materialize. Tendon transfers allow one to see the results of the 
surgery within weeks. Nerve transfer is a technically demanding 
surgery. Poor outcomes may not manifest for a while and may 
delay any discussion and plan for further surgery and interven-
tion. Patient morbidity and expenses are extended. There is a risk 
with nerve surgery of unintended damage to the donor nerve. 
Although it was not seen in our study, donor nerve injury can be 
irreversible. There are also technical limitations to nerve transfer 
surgery. For now, safe and effective surgery should be guided by 
tenets outlined elsewhere.16
Nerve transfer has not yet become the standard treatment 
of penetrating injuries to the upper extremities. Initially nerve 
transfer was used for repair of severe brachial plexus injuries; 
now indications have expanded to include distal nerve deficits 
of the upper extremity as well. More evidence on nerve transfer 
is needed to develop a treatment algorithm. 
Outcomes for reconstruction after peripheral nerve injures 
are difficult to interpret for several reasons, including lack of 
standardization, varying degrees of injury per patient, and lack 
of consensus on surgical approach. However, there is increasing 
interest in nerve transfer to treat injuries. Because nerve transfer 
is relatively new, many series have a limited number of patients, 
but more results continue to be published. The present study uses 
a large cohort and reports favorable outcomes, with more than 
50% of the patients returning to their previous level of employ-
ment. Furthermore, nerve transfer in our study was shown not to 
be associated with any morbidity, making it a safe choice when 
penetrating upper extremity injuries are encountered. A very 
important point of this study is the fact that even after 1 year of 
follow-up, some patients continued to improve. Follow-up of at 
least 3 years was required to see this improvement. Our numbers, 
however, are not large enough to make any conclusions regard-
ing predictors of late improvement. Also notable is that 63% of 
patients returned to work. Delayed completion of reconstruction 
is a strong predictor of not returning to work. Nerve transfers 
in this cohort were timely and appropriate so patients were able 
to remain motivated. The improvement in DASH score is also a 
strong predictor of patient-based outcome.

Nerve Transfer Surgery for Penetrating Upper Extremity Injuries
Limitations of this study include its retrospective nature. We 
also excluded six patients who did not complete at least three 
years’ follow-up. 
CONCLUSION
Nerve transfer has the potential to address many of the limita-
tions associated with other treatment options used for high pen-
etrating trauma of the upper extremity. In our study, we present 
16 cases that further demonstrate that nerve transfers can be done 
in a systematic manner to obtain consistently strong functional 
outcomes. Furthermore, we show that clinical improvement 
continues in some patients for up to 3 years. v

ABSTRACT
Context: Increased intake of fruits and vegetables (FV) may be 
useful for weight loss. 
Objective: This study was designed to evaluate the effects of 
changes in FV intake on the overall diet and to determine if self-
regulation affects the association between changes in FV intake 
and weight. 
Methods: Women with obesity (N = 74, mean age = 47.7 years) 
participating in a year-long behavioral weight-loss treatment 
were assessed regarding changes in consumption of various 
food groups, physical activity, and eating self-regulation over 6, 
12, and 24 months. 
Results: FV intake change significantly predicted changes in 
weight and consumption of dairy and bread products and sweets. 
The only other notable relationships were among changes in 
sweets, bread, and dairy consumption over 24 months. Over 6, 12, 
and 24 months, changes in self-regulation significantly mediated 
the FV intake-weight change relationship. The overall mediation 
models were significant (R2 values = 0.19, 0.13, and 0.32, respec-
tively). A reciprocal relationship between changes in FV intake and 
self-regulation also was found. Significant increases in physical 
activity outputs did not influence weight changes. 
Conclusion: Findings supported a relationship between FV 
intake and weight loss occurring through self-regulatory skills. 
Associations between FV intake and reduced consumption of other 
food groups provided data useful for improving the architecture 
of behavioral weight-loss treatments and the foci of medical 
practitioners’ helping methods. 
INTRODUCTION
Obesity is a medical condition with considerable effects on 
health risks and quality of life. Although the popular focus on 
targeting proportions of diet macronutrients (ie, proteins, fats, 
and carbohydrates) for weight loss has proved ineffective,1 fruit 
and vegetable (FV) intake has been associated with weight loss.2,3 
Although FV intake can influence consumption of other food 
groups,1 this has been an understudied area. Targeting as few be-
havioral changes as possible may serve as a therapeutic advantage 
when designing weight-loss treatments.4
Because it takes considerable self-control to eat more healthy 
food and less unhealthy food such as sweets, self-regulation 
instruction has become a focus of behavioral weight-loss treat-
ments that is based on accepted behavior-change theories such 
as social cognitive theory.5,6 It is possible that the increased use 
of self-regulation methods (eg, goal setting/progress tracking, 
restructuring unproductive self-talk, environmental [stimulus] 
control) mediates the FV-weight loss relationship and, further, 
has a symbiotic, mutually reinforcing relationship with FV intake. 
Women with obesity who participated in a community-based 
behavioral weight-loss program were assessed over 6, 12, and 
24 months. It was expected that increased FV intake would be 
significantly associated with reduced weight and reduced con-
sumption of other food groups. Investigators also predicted that 
the relationship between increased FV intake and reduced weight 
would be significantly mediated by treatment-associated changes 
in dietary self-regulation, and that relationships between changes 
in FV intake and self-regulation would be reciprocal. 
METHODS
Participants
Participant (N = 74) data were derived from a longitudinal test 
of treatment-associated changes in emotional eating.7 The volun-
teers were required to be at least age 21 years with a body mass 
index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 to 40 kg/m2 and not be participating 
in a weight-loss program or taking a psychotropic medication. 
Women with physical contraindications to participation (such 
as pregnancy) also were excluded. The mean age was 47.7 years 
(standard deviation [SD] = 8.0), and the mean BMI was 34.9 
kg/m2 (SD = 3.2). The racial/ethnic makeup was approximately 
two-thirds white and one-third African American; several par-
ticipants represented other racial categories. Nearly all were from 
households in the middle family income range of $50,000 to 
$100,000 yearly. University institutional review board approval 
and written informed consent were obtained. 
Measures 
Eating Behaviors 
Daily servings of vegetables (eg, 118 mL [4 ounces] of peas); 
fruits (eg, 118 mL [4 ounces] of an orange); dairy products (eg, 
236 mL [8 ounces] of yogurt); meats, beans, nuts, and other pro-
teins (eg, 59 mL [2 ounces] of boneless chicken); bread products 
(eg, 59 mL [2 small slices] of whole-grain bread); and sweets (eg, 
118 mL of a small brownie) as indicated by US Department of 
Agriculture sources8 were summed using a brief survey. FV intake 
was then aggregated. Response scores demonstrated significant 
correspondences (β values = 0.45-0.83, all p values < 0.001) with

the scores of more comprehensive and extensively validated food 
frequency recalls, and test-retest reliabilities over 3 weeks ranged 
between 0.77 and 0.83.9,10
Eating Self-Regulation 
To assess the use of self-regulation skills related to eating, re-
sponses to 10 items (1 = never to 5 = often) such as “I say positive 
things to myself about eating well” and “I keep a record of my 
eating” were summed.11 The internal consistency was Cronbach 
α = 0.81, and test-retest reliability over 2 weeks was 0.74.11 For 
the data within this study, Cronbach α = 0.80.
Physical Activity
The number of physical activity sessions per week of at least 15 
minutes’ duration was recalled using the Leisure-Time Physical 
Activity Questionnaire (Section 1).12 Activity types corresponded 
to metabolic equivalents (MET) equating O2/kg/hour ranging 
from 3 MET (eg, easy walking) to 9 MET (running) and were 
summed.12 Previous research13,14 found significant relationships 
(β values = 0.38-0.57, all p values < 0.001) between the Leisure-
Time Physical Activity Questionnaire and accelerometer, weight 
change, and maximal oxygen uptake results. Test-retest reliability 
over 2 weeks was 0.74.14
Weight
Body weight was measured using a recently calibrated digital 
scale. The mean of two consecutive measurements was recorded 
(in kg) after removal of heavy outer clothing.
Procedure 
The treatment consisted of components of physical activ-
ity support and eating-behavior change based on tenets of 
social cognitive theory,5 especially the emphasis on use of self-
regulatory skills to effectively deal with lifestyle barriers.6 The 
treatment was administered by trained wellness staff members 
at a community wellness center. 
The Coach Approach protocol15 supported physical activity 
via six 45-minute 1-on-1 meetings. Assimilation of self-regula-
tion methods such as goal setting, thought-stopping/cognitive 
restructuring, relapse prevention, dissociation, and stimulus 
control was the central focus. After 10 weeks of physical activity 
support alone, instruction in food logging was added, and group

ORIGINAL RESEARCH & CONTRIBUTIONS
Effects of Treatment-Associated Increases in Fruit and Vegetable Intake on the Consumption of Other Food Groups and Weight Through Self-Regulatory Processes
nutrition sessions were held every 2 weeks using the Weight 
Loss For Life protocol.16 Sessions adapted self-regulatory skills 
learned in the context of supporting physical activity to control 
eating. For example, restructuring unproductive statements that 
could lead to missing a planned evening physical activity ses-
sion would be adapted to address self-talk about circumventing 
dietary goals for the day. Along with self-regulation and main-
taining regular physical activity, increasing FV consumption was 
a major emphasis of the 56-week treatment. Fidelity checks on 
approximately 15% of treatment sessions indicated few protocol 
deviations that were easily remedied. 
Data Analyses
Because there was no systematic bias detected within the 8% 
of missing cases, the intention-to-treat approach incorporated 
the expectation-maximization algorithm17 for imputation. For 
the primary analyses, a moderate effect of f 2 = 0.15 at the con-
servative statistical power level of 0.90 (α < 0.05) necessitated 
a minimum sample size of 71.18 SPSS Statistics version 22.0 
(IBM, Armonk, NY) was used for the statistical analyses. 
Linear bivariate relationships first were calculated across 
changes in daily consumption of food groups and weight, sepa-
rately from baseline to months 6, 12, and 24, at which statistical 
significance was set at α < 0.05 (2-tailed). Considering previous 
research and suggestions19 and an absence of floor and ceiling 
effects, change (gain) scores were unadjusted for their baseline 
value. Mediation of the relationship of changes in FV intake and 
weight by change in self-regulation for eating over 6, 12, and 24 
months was computed next using a bootstrapping method with 
20,000 resamples.20 Because directionality within the incorpo-
rated relationships was already established, 1-tailed analyses 
(α < 0.05) were used to evaluate statistical significance. R2 was 
calculated to determine significance of the overall models, and 
path a (predictor→mediator), path b (mediator→outcome), and 
path c’ (predictor→outcome, controlling for the mediator) were 
also calculated as β values (Figure 1). Mediation significance 
was established when the bias-corrected and accelerated 95% 
confidence intervals did not include 0. Change in physical ac-
tivity was tested for its significance as a covariate. 
On the basis of previous suggestions,21 the presence of a 
reciprocal (bidirectional) relationship between changes in FV 
intake and self-regulation also was tested by reversing the posi-
tion of the predictor and mediator variables in paired equations. 
If significant mediation was found in both equations, then a 
reciprocal relationship had been detected. 
RESULTS
Score Changes
Physical activity significantly increased (all p values < 0.001) 
from a baseline mean of 6.50 (SD = 7.89) to a mean of 35.16 
(SD = 19.69) at month 6, a mean of 29.59 (SD = 16.63) at month 
12, and a mean of 30.06 (SD = 17.41) at month 24. Self-regulation 
for eating at baseline (mean = 22.09, SD = 5.85) demonstrated 
a significant increase to month 6 (meanchange = 9.79, SD = 7.13, 
p < 0.001), month 12 (meanchange = 6.25, SD = 9.12, p < 0.001), 
and month 24 (meanchange = 8.03, SD = 8.49, p < 0.001). Table 1 
details all other score changes.
Bivariate Relationships
FV intake changes from baseline to months 6, 12, and 24 served 
as significant predictors of changes in weight and bread and sweets 
consumption over 12 and 24 months and dairy consumption at 
24 months (Table 1). 
Mediation Analyses
When eating self-regulation was entered as a mediator of the 
relationships of change in FV intake and weight over 6, 12, and 
24 months, change in physical activity did not demonstrate a 
significant effect on the prediction of weight change (β = -0.02, 
SE = 0.03; β = -0.04, SE = 0.04; and β = -0.07, SE = 0.04, re-
spectively). As a result, this variable was removed from further 
analyses. The overall mediation models were each significant

In models in which the predictor and mediator variables were 
reversed, there were significant mediations (Table 2). This indi-
cated reciprocal, bidirectional relationships between changes in 
self-regulation and FV intake.
DISCUSSION
Findings supported relationships between both short- and 
long-term increases in FV intake and reduced weight loss and 
reductions in consumption of other food groups. This finding is 
consistent with previous suggestions that increased FV intake 
will reduce consumption of other food types and overall energy 
intake.22 However, additional analyses within the present research 
suggest that the significant relationship between increased FV 
consumption and weight loss was achieved through (ie, signifi-
cantly mediated by) increased self-regulation. Increasing positive 
(targeted) behaviors associated with eating more FV likely required 
participants to use more of their self-regulatory skills. As these 
skills were bolstered and used more effectively, improved eating 
behaviors emerged. Duplicating this scenario could advance the 
mutually reinforcing relationship that was documented through 
the reciprocal interaction between increases in FV intake and self-
regulation. Both theory and systematic reviews strongly suggest 
the importance of self-regulation as a key mediator of weight-loss 
treatment effects.6,23,24 
Although this study was limited by a single-group design with 
a volunteer sample that may have been especially motivated, it 
provides new analyses and a basis for further research into the 
dynamics of treatment-associated changes in diet, self-regulation, 
and weight loss. Extensions of this research should strengthen 
measurement instrumentation by incorporating validated food 
recall surveys that differentiate within food groups (eg, starchy vs 
nonstarchy vegetables) and accelerometers that can more objectively 
measure physical activity outputs. After implementing these mea-
sures and completing replications involving more ethnicities and 
sample types, a continued focus on FV intake and self-regulatory 
skills development can help increase the effectiveness of behavioral 
weight-loss programs that primarily are unreliable beyond the 
very short term.25 Ultimately, medical professionals’ support of 
patients’ weight-management efforts will be enhanced. v

ABSTRACT
Context: Psychiatric comorbidity is common in orthopedic injury, but the effects on 
hospital care outcomes have been identified only generally. 
Objective: To quantify psychiatric comorbidity and its outcome effects in a large, mul-
ticenter population of inpatients with orthopedic injuries. 
Design: Retrospective analysis of patient discharge data from 507 California hospitals 
from 2001 to 2010. Study sample included orthopedic diagnoses using International Clas-
sification of Diseases codes for major pelvic and lower extremity injuries in patients older 
than age 17 years. From the injury data, we extracted psychiatric diagnoses, alcoholism, 
substance abuse, and sociodemographic characteristics.
Main Outcome Measures: Length of stay, surgical complications, and inpatient deaths.
Results: The entire injury admissions represented about 1.9% of all hospital admissions 
and were predominantly older than age 64 years, white, and women with conventional 
health care insurance. The most common comorbidity in the patients with injury was 
psychiatric illness (24.7%). The most common psychiatric diagnoses in orthopedic injury 
admissions were dementia (14.3%) and depression (6.9%) without association. Compared 
with the injury admissions with no psychiatric diagnosis, admissions with psychiatric diag-
nosis had higher odds of a hospital stay of 7 or more days, surgical treatment complications, 
and inhospital death. 
Conclusion: Psychiatric comorbidity adversely affects several hospital outcomes in 
patients with orthopedic injuries: Length of stay, surgical complications, and inpatient 
mortality. In low-income populations, the adverse psychiatric effects are incrementally 
worse. The adverse effects of psychiatric comorbidity, particularly dementia and depres-
sion, on hospital outcomes should stimulate improved psychiatric care of many patients 
at risk of poor clinical outcomes.
INTRODUCTION
Orthopedic injuries frequently require 
acute hospitalization for urgent care. Many 
patients are admitted with clinically signif-
icant comorbidities, which affect outcomes 
of hospital care.1 Psychiatric comorbidity 
is a frequent confounding factor in effec-
tive care.1-10 Some investigators have found 
adverse effects on orthopedic outcomes 
owing to concurrent psychiatric diagno-
ses.1,2,5,11,12 Also, other studies have shown 
ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic dispari-
ties in care of orthopedic conditions.13-17 
However, multicenter studies have not yet 
validated and explained some outcome ob-
servations in these injured patients. Also, 
several specific psychiatric diagnoses have 
not yet been correlated with outcomes of 
acute orthopedic hospital care.
The purpose of this study is to report 
characteristics of hospitalized orthopedic 
injury/fracture patients in California, and 
to investigate the association of psychi-
atric diagnoses with length of hospital 
stay (LOS), surgical treatment complica-
tions and inhospital mortality in a large 
population of hospitalized patients with 
orthopedic injuries.
METHODS 
A cross-sectional analysis was con-
ducted of patient discharge data from 
507 California hospitals in a database 
maintained by the Office of Statewide 
Health Planning and Development. The 
database includes patient diagnoses, types 
of procedures, hospital characteristics, pa-
tient demographics, LOS, complications, 
comorbidity, costs, route of discharge, 
and self-reported race/ethnicity. For the 
present study, we used discharge data 
between 2001 and 2010. We included 
orthopedic diagnoses, using the Inter-
national Classification of Disease, Ninth 
Edition (ICD-9) codes for major pelvic 
and lower extremity injuries that required 
hospital care in patients older than age 
17 years. From the injury data we also 
extracted psychiatric diagnoses, alcohol-
ism, and substance abuse, as well as age 
(< 65 years as the reference vs ≥ 65 years), 
sex, race/ethnicity (white vs black/African 
American, Hispanic, and Asian/other), 
insurance (private/Medicare vs Medi-Cal/
other), number of comorbidities, LOS 
 
(< 7 days vs ≥ 7 days), complications 
(yes vs no), and inhospital death (yes vs no). 
All analyses were obtained and ana-
lyzed using analytics software (Statistical 
Analysis Software [SAS] Version 9.3, 
SAS Institute. Cary, NC). We used fre-
quency (count and percentage) to depict 
the overall characteristics of the sample 
for the categorical variables (age, sex, 
race/ethnicity, insurance status, LOS, and 
comorbidity). We conducted bivariate 
analysis using the χ2 test to determine the 
statistical difference in the outcome vari-
ables (LOS, surgical complications, and

inpatient deaths) by the main independent 
variable (psychiatric diagnoses), alcohol 
abuse, and substance abuse, and the other 
independent variables (age, sex, race/eth-
nicity, insurance status, and number of 
comorbidities). In addition, we performed 
multiple logistic regressions to test the 
independent association between study 
predictor variables and the outcomes 
variables while controlling for the other 
variables in the model (ie, age, sex, race/
ethnicity, insurance status, and number 
of comorbidities). Adjusted odds ratios 
(ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
are presented, and statistical significance 
was considered at p value ≤ 0.05.
RESULTS
The entire injury admission population 
was about 1.9% of all hospital admissions 
(Figure 1). Table 1 presents the demo-
graphic characteristics of the hospital 
admissions with orthopedic injuries. These 
patients were predominantly older than 
age 64 years, white women with a conven-
tional health care insurance profile. These 
characteristics were similar to the charac-
teristics of general admissions except that 
injury admissions were predominantly 
older (data not shown). 
As indicated in Table 2, overall, the 
most common comorbidity in the patients 
with orthopedic injury was a psychiatric 
illness (24.7%). The specific psychiatric 
diagnoses in the general admissions and 
injury admissions with psychiatric di-
agnoses are shown in Table 2. The most 
common psychiatric diagnoses in injury 
admissions were dementias (14.3%) fol-
lowed by depression (6.9%). Besides 
psychiatric diagnoses, diabetes mellitus 
was equally the most frequent comorbid-
ity in both the general admissions and 
orthopedic injury admissions (data not 
shown). A small percentage of the injury 
admissions with psychiatric diagnoses 
had a diagnosis of alcoholism (2.0%) or 
substance abuse (0.9%).
The correlations between psychiatric 
diagnosis and other study variables in the 
injury population and hospital outcomes 
are shown in Table 3. Psychiatric illness 
was correlated with prolonged hospital 
stay of the patients with injury, surgical 
treatment complications, and inhospital 
death (p < 0.001).

Association of Psychiatric Diagnostic Conditions with Hospital Care Outcomes of Patients with Orthopedic Injuries 
Table 4 presents the independent 
predictors of LOS, surgical treatment 
complications, and inhospital death of 
hospitalized patients with orthopedic 
injury. Compared with the injury admis-
sions with no psychiatric diagnosis, ad-
missions with psychiatric diagnosis had 
higher odds of 7 or more days of hospital 
stay (OR = 1.27; CI = 1.25-1.29), higher 
odds of having surgical treatment com-
plications (OR = 1.18; CI = 1.15-1.20), 
and higher odds of inhospital death 
(OR = 1.15; CI = 1.10-1.20). These results 
were statistically significant. 
Of the other variables in Table 4, injury 
admissions with substance abuse, alcohol-
ism, age 65 years or older, and comorbid 
conditions as well as those from an eth-
nic minority group had higher odds of 
staying in the hospital 7 or more days 
compared with their counterparts with-
out these characteristics. On the other 
hand, female sex and having private/
Medicare insurance lowered the odds of 
a lengthy hospital stay compared with 
their reference groups. 
With respect to surgical treatment 
complications, injury admissions with 
substance abuse, alcoholism, and co-
morbid conditions had higher odds of 
complications, whereas age 65 years or 
older, female sex, belonging to an ethic 
minority group, and having private/
Medicare insurance lowered the chance of 
treatment complications for these groups 
compared with their reference groups. As 
for inhospital deaths, alcoholism, age 65 
years or older, and comorbid conditions 
increased the odds of mortality, whereas 
substance abuse, female sex, belonging

Association of Psychiatric Diagnostic Conditions with Hospital Care Outcomes of Patients with Orthopedic Injuries 
to an ethic minority group, and having 
private/Medicare insurance lowered the 
chance of inhospital death for these groups 
compared with their reference groups.
Table 5 displays the separate analysis 
for each psychiatric diagnosis and their 
association with LOS, surgical treatment 
complications, and inhospital deaths. The 
largest percentage of prolonged hospital 
stays and surgical treatment complications 
belonged to patients with schizophrenia 
(45.2% and 14.7%, respectively), and the 
largest percentage of inhospital deaths 
belonged to the dementia group (3.9%) 
followed by the depression group (2.2%).
DISCUSSION
These data are consistent with recent 
study findings regarding the psychiatric 
effects on acute hospital care of patients 
with orthopedic injury.2,6 However, this 
study extends the understanding of psy-
chiatric effects to a much larger group of 
patients because it includes all orthopedic 
injury admissions across a large spectrum 
of hospitals and localities across the entire 
state of California. The data show that there 
is an important burden of psychiatric illness 
in hospitalized patients with orthopedic 
injuries and that psychiatric comorbidity is 
correlated with higher prevalence of surgi-
cal complications, longer hospital LOS, 
and higher inhospital mortality. Among 
the psychiatric comorbidities, dementia 
and depression each accounted for a greater 
percentage of prolonged hospital stays, sur-
gical complications, and inhospital deaths 
compared with other psychiatric diagnoses. 
Focused rehabilitation is the pertinent 
clinical implication growing from these ob-
servations. However, this term is complex, 
multifactorial, and not fully defined and is 
beyond the scope of this study, needing to 
be addressed in future studies. 
In addition, our further look at the data 
showed adverse correlations between hospi-
tal care of patients with orthopedic injuries 
with psychiatric illness and their category of 
health insurance. This finding agrees with 
recent information in the care of patients 
with hip fracture in which low-income 
status was independently correlated with 
adverse care parameters.16 In the current 
study, low-income patients with psychiatric 
illness remain in acute hospital care twice as 
long as the conventionally insured patients 
(data not shown). Patients in lower socio-
economic groups experience more surgical 
complications when they have a psychiatric 
illness, and they also have longer LOS than 
in the general patient population. Poor 
hospital surgical outcomes not only affect 
patient well-being but also increase the 
cost of care.18 Surgical complications and 
prolonged LOS have both been reported to 
increase the cost of medical care.19-22
There are many reports of the adverse 
outcomes in orthopedic inpatients owing 
to psychiatric comorbidities.1,6-11 There are 
also reports of improved outcomes from 
systematic, multidisciplinary care of or-
thopedic inpatients.18,23 There appears to 
be an unexplained failure of improved 
medical management of these patients 
with respect to psychiatric comorbidities.

ORIGINAL RESEARCH & CONTRIBUTIONS
Association of Psychiatric Diagnostic Conditions with Hospital Care Outcomes of Patients with Orthopedic Injuries 
Our study has some limitations. The 
methods in this study depended on the ac-
curacy of diagnostic coding of the patient 
data used. Therefore, conclusions may be 
inaccurate and/or misleading if the data 
were found to be corrupted in the origi-
nal collection process.24,25 This criticism is 
somewhat mitigated by the large number 
of heterogeneous sources of data and the 
large numbers of patients studied. In ad-
dition, the data that were reviewed did not 
state the criteria that were used to establish 
the various psychiatric diagnoses. This pos-
sible variation in diagnostic criteria from 
case to case could have either increased or 
decreased the prevalence of the psychiatric 
diagnoses. Finally, the data reflected the 
probability that some patients suffered 
from multiple diagnoses in either injury 
diagnoses or psychiatric diagnoses or both. 
This clinical situation explained differences 
in some of the total population numbers 
but did not affect the overall conclusions.
CONCLUSION
Psychiatric illness is common in hos-
pitalized patients with orthopedic in-
jury (24.7%), particularly in elderly, white 
women. Psychiatric comorbidity, particu-
larly dementia and depression, adversely 
affects hospital outcomes in LOS, surgical 
complications in patients with fracture, 
and inpatient mortality in these patients 
with orthopedic injuries. In low-income 
populations, the adverse psychiatric effects 
are incrementally worse for LOS, surgical 
complications, and inpatient mortality. 
Future studies may show that improved 
psychiatric care of these patients may 
improve hospital outcomes, especially in 
low-income populations. v

In depression … faith in deliverance, in ultimate restoration, is absent. 
The pain is unrelenting, and what makes the condition intolerable is the 
foreknowledge that no remedy will come—not in a day, an hour, or a 
minute … . It is hopelessness even more than pain that crushes the soul.
— William Styron, 1925-2006, American novelist and essayist

ABSTRACT
Introduction: Nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic medica-
tions, or “Z-drugs,” are commonly used to treat insomnia among 
older adults (≥ 65 years), despite a lack of evidence of long-term 
effectiveness and evidence linking long-term use with poor 
outcomes. 
Objective: To understand patient and clinician barriers and 
facilitators to deprescribing, or discontinuation, of Z-drugs.
Methods: We conducted a qualitative interview study among 
older adults who received a deprescribing intervention and among 
their clinicians at Kaiser Permanente Northwest. Semistructured 
interviews explored perceived barriers and facilitators to success-
ful deprescribing of Z-drugs. Interviews were audiorecorded with 
participant permission. Content was analyzed using QSR NVivo 
10 software.
Results: From the perspectives of patients, the greatest chal-
lenges to deprescribing are factors related to their insomnia, 
including the need for effective treatment of their insomnia; 
health care system factors, including a desire for personalized 
approaches to care; and their own positive personal experiences 
with sedative medication use. From the clinician perspective, a lack 
of institutional structures and resources to support deprescribing, 
the attitudes and practices of previous clinicians, and patient-
related factors such as dependence and a lack of alternatives to 
treat insomnia were the most important barriers to deprescribing.
Conclusions: Health care systems must provide individualized 
care that supports patient goals for restful sleep and quality of life 
while also providing evidence-based care that takes patient safety 
into account. To accomplish this, systems must support patients 
and clinicians and provide a multidisciplinary approach that ad-
dresses insomnia treatment, provides patient education about 
sedative medication use, and supports the discontinuation process. 
INTRODUCTION
Nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic medications, or “Z-drugs,” 
are routinely prescribed to adults age 65 years and older for the 
treatment of insomnia.1-4 However, there is a lack of evidence 
that these medications—which include eszopiclone, zaleplon, 
and zolpidem—improve sleep over the long term, and research 
findings link long-term use among older adults with falls, day-
time sedation, cognitive impairment, decreased quality of life, 
dependence and abuse, and hospitalization.5-8 In recognition 
of these risks, the American Geriatrics Society discourages 
the use of nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotics among older 
adults.5 Despite this, older adults continue to receive Z-drugs 
for months, years, or even decades.
Deprescribing is a research area focused on the process of 
discontinuation of drugs when existing or potential harms 
outweigh existing or potential benefits for an individual.9 Al-
though the considerable evidence of the adverse effects of Z-
drugs among older patients supports the need for deprescribing, 
few studies have studied interventions to stop their use.10 One 
approach with great potential is direct-to-patient education 
that provides information about the risks of medication use 
and empowers patients to start discussions with their clinician 
about deprescribing.11-13 In parallel with the implementation 
of a direct-to-patient educational intervention, we conducted 
a qualitative study to examine older adults’ and primary care 
clinicians’ knowledge and attitudes regarding nonbenzodiaz-
epine medication use and to identify barriers and facilitators 
to deprescribing. 
METHODS
Study Setting and Design
We conducted our qualitative interview study from Febru-
ary 2017 to April 2017 among older adults who had received 
an intervention to encourage deprescribing of their Z-drug 
and among their primary care clinicians at Kaiser Perman-
ente Northwest (KPNW), an integrated health care delivery 
system in Oregon and Washington. Patients were eligible for 
the intervention if they were age 64 years or older and received 
multiple dispensings of Z-drugs in the previous year. Z-drugs 
include eszopiclone, zaleplon, and zolpidem. Patients were 
randomly assigned to either usual care (an intervention that 
provided mailed educational materials) or an intervention that 
included both mailed educational materials and pharmacist 
consultation. The mailed educational materials described the 
risks and benefits related to Z-drug use, provided information 
about nonpharmacologic alternatives to these therapies (eg, 
sleep hygiene techniques), outlined how a patient might taper 
the medication, and provided guidance for how a patient can 
pursue discontinuation of this medication. Collectively, the edu-
cational mailing sought to engage patients in shared decision 
making and to encourage patients to initiate a conversation with 
a pharmacist or their clinician around discontinuation of their 
nonbenzodiazepine medication. The pharmacist consultation

Barriers and Facilitators to the Deprescribing of Nonbenzodiazepine Sedative Medications Among Older Adults 
reinforced the messaging of the mailed educational materials 
and provided additional information about the risks related to 
nonbenzodiazepine use and suggested approaches to taper that 
use. (Intervention educational materials are available on request.) 
Participant Identification and Recruitment 
We identified potential interview participants from a list of 
intervention recipients. We mailed invitations to randomly se-
lected patients and followed these with phone calls. We identified 
primary care clinicians who had prescribed Z-drugs for patients 
who received an intervention and invited them to participate via 
an initial recruitment e-mail and one follow-up e-mail if neces-
sary. We enrolled patients for a 45-minute to 60-minute telephone 
interview and clinicians for a 25-minute to 35-minute telephone 
interview. Patients received a $20 gift card for participation; clini-
cians were not compensated.
Data Collection and Analysis
We created a patient interview guide exploring past and cur-
rent use of nonbenzodiazepines, prior education about sedative 
use, educational needs, and reactions to the intervention materials 
(Sidebar: Patient Interview Guide, available at: www.theperma-
nentejournal.org/files/2018/17-157-Sidebars.pdf). We created a 
primary care clinician interview guide exploring approaches to 
providing care to older adults with insomnia, sedative medication 
prescribing practices, reaction to the intervention materials, and 
factors that hinder or support deprescribing of sedatives (Side-
bar: Primary Care Physician Interview Guide, available at: www.
thepermanentejournal.org/files/2018/17-157-Sidebars.pdf ). 
Interviews were conducted by a single interviewer (see Sidebar: 
Interviewer Adherence with COREQ Standards available at 
www.thepermanentejournal.org/files/2018/17-157-Sidebars.pdf 
for interviewer adherence with Consolidated Criteria for Re-
porting Qualitative Research [COREQ] standards) and were 
recorded with participant permission. This study was approved 
by the KPNW institutional review board.
We used NVivo Version 10 software (QSR International, 
Doncaster, Victoria, Australia) for data analysis. We conducted a 
conventional content analysis for patient and clinician interviews 
separately.14 We coded all interview responses on the basis of the 
interview guide content and, after coding all interviews, further 
examined and classified the data for each code into overarching 
categories.
RESULTS
We recruited 25 patients. We were unable to reach 10 of those 
patients, 5 refused participation, and 10 consented to an interview 
(1 man, 9 women). One patient initiated a taper of the Z-drug 
dosage and 1 patient stopped the medication after receiving the 
educational materials. Two patients considered but did not initiate 
tapering after their conversation with the intervention pharmacist. 
Six patients did not indicate their intent after the intervention. 
We sent 36 e-mails and enrolled 6 primary care clinicians 
(3 women, 3 men). One additional clinician was referred for 
participation by another clinician; none of her patients received 
the intervention.
Patient Perspective
We assigned patient responses to 1 of 9 initial codes that in-
cluded approaches to insomnia, beliefs and attitudes about depre-
scribing, and barriers and facilitators to deprescribing. From these 
coded data, we identified 3 overarching categories that patients 
considered crucial in understanding their sedative medication 
use and the barriers and facilitators of discontinuation of that 
use: 1) factors related to insomnia and its treatment, 2) health 
care delivery system-related factors, and 3) patient experiences 
with sedative medications and potential concerns. See Table 1 
for patient comments.

Quotations
Insomnia-related 
factors
“I’d rather not take it; I’d rather not take any medications. But you know, I’m approaching [age] 68, and I have a variety of medical 
conditions where it makes sense to take medications.”
“Who came up with information I received in the mail, you know, take a half, don’t take one. … Because if this truly works, then give 
me proof. … I’m skeptical because there hasn’t really been a study done on people who have taken [zolpidem] for a long time that I’m 
aware of. No information has come to my door. I am open-minded and if somebody can prove to me that it [tapering] really works, but  
if it doesn’t work for me I want to be able to go back on [zolpidem] so I can sleep.” 
Structural and health 
care delivery system-
related factors
“Dr X is extremely helpful in the sense that he says he trusts me to know my body, and I can take them as long as I feel the need for it.” 
“I have ordered it, and the doctors have prescribed it. I don’t think there have been many conversations with the pharmacist about side 
effects. … It has never been proactively communicated before; nobody has ever said you have to stop taking this.” 
Patient experiences  
and concerns
“To be honest with you, I never had a lot of the symptoms that they are talking about [in the brochure]. I felt better in the morning, not 
groggy. I never fell asleep during the day, I did when I couldn’t sleep. I never fell, I am 67, obviously in my mind, I think we have all of 
those. I felt like I never had any of these effects that they are talking about. … The [symptom] I was looking at that would not want me to 
take it more than anything is the involuntary urine loss. … I was always really careful about it; I never wanted to become dependent on 
it. I was very mindful. If I had taken it 3 times and I couldn’t sleep on the weekend, I didn’t take it.” 
“I haven’t had any falls. The only time I have had a fall from medication was when I tried to take trazodone and that made me so dizzy 
that I felt frightened to take it. … I never felt that way with [zolpidem]. As far as I have felt confused or fuzzy, it is very hard for me to 
tease out whether I feel confused or fuzzy from medication or from stress or from my age or whatever is on my mind. Sometimes I take 
[zolpidem] and I wake up and I feel well rested, and it is a wonderful feeling, and other times I wake up feeling groggy or feeling like I’m 
in a cloud. But that’s also true when I don’t take it or when I haven’t taken it for a while.”

Barriers and Facilitators to the Deprescribing of Nonbenzodiazepine Sedative Medications Among Older Adults 
Factors Related to Insomnia and Its Treatment
Patients expressed that insomnia is a long-term diagnosis that 
takes many different forms but requires ongoing intervention. 
Patients emphasized that restful sleep is a key component for a 
high quality of life and their sedative medication has helped to 
achieve that. Patients felt that potentially initiating a tapering 
process presented them with the dilemma of finding an alterna-
tive safe treatment to maintain that quality of life. Related to 
this, a crucial obstacle was the perceived lack of alternatives and 
the fear that they may experience a compromised quality of life 
when sleepless nights return. One patient noted: 
I had extreme insomnia, and even cutting down from 10 mg 
to 5 mg has definitely made my sleep much harder and it takes 
much longer for me to go to sleep. … I’m worried that if I cut 
down even slowly that I’ll have a lot of trouble. I’m 77 years old, 
and my quality of life will change for the worse if the insomnia 
comes back. 
Patients did, however, believe that education about possible, 
safer alternatives could serve as an important motivator for 
people to initiate tapering. As one patient noted:
I was very willing to try a different sleep aid for this lifestyle 
I keep, and so I am open to better understand what other options 
I have to keep the same regimen I have.
One patient who had successfully stopped taking her sedative 
medication was willing to experience insomnia again because 
her lifestyle had changed, and she did not need as much restful 
sleep anymore. This patient noted:
The main reason I took it was because I was working. … [A]fter 
I retired, if I only get one hour of sleep, the next day, I can handle 
it. I have not felt the need. Yes, sometimes I have insomnia, but 
it is not critical, as I don’t have to go to work.
Factors Related to the Health Care Delivery System
Patients expressed their wish to be treated as an individual, rather 
than merely a member of a particular age group. One patient noted:
Maybe it isn’t a great idea for people over 65 to be taking any 
kind of sleep medication, but maybe it isn’t such a bad idea when 
you balance it against fatigue. … The notion that everybody should 
or nobody should is maybe not the most individualized approach 
to medicine or health.
Patients expressed frustration with cookie-cutter approaches 
to deprescribing nonbenzodiazepines. Many patients did not 
identify with the patient stories, generalized descriptions of 
insomnia, or alternative strategies to treat insomnia (eg, sleep 
hygiene) included in the educational materials. As noted by one 
patient, “The brochure didn’t target me at all. There are many 
different kinds of insomnia. … I mean, people who don’t really 
have insomnia think there is only one kind.” 
Patients pointed out that many primary care clinicians didn’t 
emphasize deprescribing during regular encounters. In one pa-
tient’s experience:
My provider hasn’t really brought it up [tapering]. A few years ago, 
I brought it up, and she referred me to an online program. Then, I was 
referred to a sleep specialist who put me on a different medication.
Patient Experiences with Sedative Medications  
and Potential Concerns
Patients’ overall experiences of taking their nonbenzodiaz-
epine were very positive, and very few reported any side effects. 
One patient said, “[Zolpidem] works, and that’s what I want to 
stay on. There [are] no side effects.” 
Considering their overall high satisfaction with their sedative 
medication, patients expressed mixed reactions about how side ef-
fects would affect their continued use of their nonbenzodiazepine.

Overarching theme
Quotations
Institutional structures
“If I decide to taper … anybody [off] any medication, I find the follow-up very complicated and cumbersome and a pain in the butt for 
the [practitioner] because we are the ones that need to be calling the patient every week or couple of weeks. It is time-consuming. I 
have managed to wean 2 patients off medications, but I don’t want to do it anymore because of the follow-up that it requires. If I could 
assure that somebody else would do the follow-up—who asks, how are you doing? How are you dealing with this dose? Do you need 
to get back to the previous dose?—That would make it easier. … If we have full schedules and only 20 minutes and people have 8 or 
9 different problems, and sedative medications is one of them, it is usually not my top priority. I know that I’m creating a nightmare with 
follow-up.”
“We do not have enough time for us to follow[-up] these people. We don’t even have time to see our regular patients, and, for older 
patients, a barrier is that we don’t have much support.”
Patient characteristics  
and attitudes
“For the people who have been using [zolpidem] and who are in this elderly age group, they tried everything else. If they wake up in 
the morning and they feel groggy and can’t focus, they don’t want to take that medication. … But people who do tolerate it have no 
complaints at all and feel well and don’t have any issues they are concerned about. They feel great, they feel refreshed, they are up 
in the morning and do whatever it is they do. Once they find the medication that works, they are very happy and very irritated by any 
attempts not to prescribe this medication any longer.”
“It can be a tough sell to get patients off of these meds. They are used to them, they have a pattern, they know how they feel when 
they are using them and they are afraid of quitting them and not being able to sleep or some other adverse effects. So I try to frame 
it for them again in terms of safety, and you know elderly people, their sleep patterns are very different than young people. … Having 
these kind of meds on board can be quite dangerous. I try to frame it for them in this way to help them understand that I want them to 
be safe.”
Clinician characteristics  
and attitudes
“The problem with this medication is that this medication was given like candy. The older doctors gave it like candy. These patients 
have already been on these medications when we were probably in junior high. Right now we just step into their lives, we try to take 
them off and imagine they have been on it for a long time, it was the norm before. … I strongly feel that I inherited a problem that was 
created in the past.”

Barriers and Facilitators to the Deprescribing of Nonbenzodiazepine Sedative Medications Among Older Adults 
Some patients reported that side effects would play a crucial 
role in their desire to discontinue use of the medication. As one 
patient noted:
Perhaps when I retire, and it is not so important that I go back 
to sleep, maybe I would consider it then. But right now it seems 
to serve a purpose. … If I had any inclinations to experience side 
effects, then I would stop it.
However, others believed that experiencing side effects would 
not be sufficient cause for them to taper the use of these medica-
tions. In general, patients felt that they were critical consumers 
who weighed the pros and cons of continuing to take nonben-
zodiazepines. 
Primary Care Clinician Perspective
We allocated clinician interview responses to 1 of 12 codes, 
including prescribing practices, insomnia treatment, management 
of sedative medication use, and barriers and facilitators to depre-
scribing. We then classified feedback into 3 overarching categories 
that summarize the challenges primary care clinicians experience 
in managing and deprescribing sedative medication use among 
older adults: 1) institutional structures, 2) patient characteristics 
and attitudes, and 3) clinician characteristics and attitudes. See 
Table 2 for clinician comments.
Institutional Structures
Primary care clinicians perceived a lack of institutional sup-
port and resources as a crucial obstacle to deprescribing. They 
believed that tapering dosages and deprescribing medications is 
a time-intensive process, both in terms of initiating the tapering 
process and overseeing it: 
The only thing I really strongly recommend is that we have good 
support. We can start the taper off, but if I could send the patient 
information to a certain pool and tell them that they have to moni-
tor a patient for four weeks to see how she is doing.
Clinicians also noted the need for additional support to initiate 
and oversee that process. One clinician noted:
We do not have enough time for us to follow [-up with] these 
people. We don’t even have time to see our regular patients and, 
for older patients, a barrier is that we don’t have much support.
Clinicians also pointed out a lack of clinical staff and infra-
structure to address insomnia-related concerns, with one primary 
care clinician noting:
[W]e need more resources to help people with insomnia. … We 
don’t really have a clinic where we can send patients. If we had 
additional resources to help out with insomnia, as there are for 
pain, that would be great.
Primary care clinicians suggested a need for the health 
care system to prioritize deprescribing, present tapering as 
an activity prioritized by the system rather than only a single 
clinician, and to create incentives that would encourage the 
clinician to deprescribe. One primary care clinician noted that 
initiating the tapering process is counter to values—such as 
patient satisfaction—that the health care organization cur-
rently emphasizes: 
There is a lot of emphasis on patient satisfaction, which is a 
double-edged sword. Sometimes we don’t practice good medicine 
because good medicine often means not to make our patients happy. 
Patients want immediate gratification. It is threatening for us. I’m 
judged by how fast a patient gets to see me. Nobody cares how many 
patients I have tapered off medication.
Finally, primary care clinicians also commented that non-
benzodiazepines pose a unique challenge because they are not 
considered as high a deprescribing priority as are medications 
such as opioids and benzodiazepines.
Characteristics and Attitudes of Patients 
Clinicians emphasized that patients have come to physically, 
emotionally, and psychologically depend on nonbenzodiazepines; 
thus, they are very reluctant to give them up. One primary care 
clinician noted, “The big challenge is that many patients have 
been on this [regimen] for a long time. … The psychological and 
physiological dependence is difficult.” 
Primary care clinicians felt that there are few effective alterna-
tives they can offer to patients if they were to pursue deprescribing 
of nonbenzodiazepines. One clinician noted, 
There are not really many good alternative medications to help 
with sleep or anxiety. Even if I taper one medication, they usually 
want something else. They say, ‘Well, I can’t sleep without it, so what 
are you going to give me instead?’ Often they are not receptive to 
behavioral techniques to try and help.
Primary care clinicians find it challenging to convincingly com-
municate concerns about potential side effects and patient safety, 
because patients often started taking nonbenzodiazepines after 
negative experiences with other medications. Few long-term users 
experience side effects and don’t identify with the safety concerns. 
Clinicians also mentioned that deprescribing runs counter to a 
culture in health care that makes pills readily available rather than 
making other treatments available. One noted:
The majority just want a pill; it’s the American way. We don’t 
really want to work for it. It is going to take more than a pamphlet. 
… We need to teach people about these medications.
Clinician Characteristics and Attitudes 
Many primary care clinicians perceived that deprescribing has 
only recently become a priority and that generous prescribing in 
the past has now created an undue burden on current clinicians 
as they try to proactively address nonbenzodiazepine use among 
elderly patients. One clinician noted:
The problem is, quite frankly, that we don’t start [prescribing] 
the medication. Most people come in on them. They were given 
them by their psychiatrist ten years ago and were continued on 
these medicines, and we are just left with a panel that has a high 
prevalence [of use] through nothing that I did. Now I’m supposed 
to be [the] one to stop it.
Thus, deprescribing requires clinicians to be proactive and to 
offer a reasonable alternative: 
I try to be proactive with the 60 to 64[-year-old] group. I don’t 
like to just tell them that they can’t take it anymore, but I tell them 
we need to find something safer for you to use, because this isn’t safe 
for you. I try to frame it for patients in this way because the safety of 
the patient is paramount, and I’m not just taking their meds away.
Some primary care clinicians are defeated by this burden and 
simply choose to maintain existing prescriptions, because the 
challenge of deprescribing seems too daunting. This shift in em-
phasis for clinicians causes frustration and inactivity, for example:

Barriers and Facilitators to the Deprescribing of Nonbenzodiazepine Sedative Medications Among Older Adults 
For patients who have continued prescriptions, most of which 
have never been started by me, I typically just continue those. Here is 
the thing: We have infinite resources to prescribe pills. We have very 
finite and limited resources to actually educate and inform patients 
about the things they need to know to wean themselves off these 
medicines. The limiting factor is not only what patients are willing 
to do but also the resources that we can provide them to help out.
DISCUSSION
Our study provides insights into challenges faced by older 
adults and primary care clinicians when confronted with depre-
scribing Z-drugs. We identified insomnia-specific, institutional, 
and patient and clinician factors that, if addressed, could lead 
to reductions in potentially inappropriate use of nonbenzodi-
azepine medications. 
Primary care clinicians emphasized that the time required 
for appropriate discussion with the patient and for ongoing 
monitoring limits their ability to deprescribe medications. To 
address this, clinicians suggested a multidisciplinary approach, 
including support from health care professionals that can help 
treat patients’ insomnia, counsel patients who are taking non-
benzodiazepines, and explain the process of tapering medica-
tion use. They also emphasized the need for the health care 
system to prioritize deprescribing, which included creating a 
culture that supports primary care clinicians in their efforts 
to deprescribe and recognizing or incentivizing those efforts. 
Primary care clinicians also expressed that the current need to 
deprescribe is related to the prescribing practices of past health 
care providers and a historical lack of emphasis on conserva-
tive use of nonbenzodiazepines. Finally, primary care clinicians 
believe that they have few alternatives to offer patients who 
have often used nonbenzodiazepines for a long time; thus, they 
remain likely to continue to prescribe nonbenzodiazepines. 
Collectively, these perceptions suggest the need for proactive 
education that encourages more conservative prescribing of 
nonbenzodiazepines early on and greater health care system 
support for deprescribing. 
Patients also cited health care system barriers to deprescrib-
ing; however, they primarily emphasized the need for support 
systems that address insomnia. When deprescribing was the 
emphasis, patients pointed out a lack of clinician prioritization 
of deprescribing. They also felt that evidence about the safety of 
Z-drug use among older adults did not apply to them. A shift in 
emphasis from deprescribing to harm reduction, as one patient 
suggested, may provide a compromise between evidence-based 
medicine and patient safety quality measures while also provid-
ing care that addresses patient-centered goals such as restful 
sleep and quality of life. 
Primary care clinicians emphasized duration of sedative medi-
cation use and difficulties associated with physical and emotional 
dependency as barriers to deprescribing. In contrast, patients did 
not note concerns about dependency. Rather, patients reported 
that they had used their nonbenzodiazepine for extended peri-
ods without experiencing side effects. Some patients said they 
would not be interested in taking the medication if they were 
experiencing side effects; however, many patients commented 
that the threat of side effects did not outweigh the positive as-
pects of nonbenzodiazepine use or the potential for decreases 
in restful sleep or quality of life if they should discontinue use. 
Patients, but not clinicians, expressed concern about the need 
to balance deprescribing with long-term treatment of their 
insomnia. In our interviews, patients emphasized that their 
quality of life is at stake. In response, health care systems will 
need plans for medication discontinuation that educate the 
patient about alternative approaches to insomnia and ways to 
cope with withdrawal reactions and the transition from Z-drug 
use to these alternative insomnia treatments. 
Patients also expressed their frustration with a perceived lack 
of safe alternatives. Although nonpharmacologic, behavioral 
treatments exist, clinicians also perceived that they had few 
alternatives to offer. In practice, a solution may be a focus on im-
proving clinician education about safe and effective alternatives 
and institutional preparedness to provide nonpharmacologic 
treatment to patients with insomnia, while also communicating 
the lack of evidence of benefit and increasing evidence of harm 
associated with nonbenzodiazepine use among older adults. 
Collectively, this shift in focus would address patient needs, 
decrease dependence on medications, and lessen the burden 
on primary care clinicians. 
A strength of our study, in contrast to other studies that fo-
cused on other medications or specific populations,15-17 is that 
we conducted it among a general population of older adults and 
their clinicians, within the context of a deprescribing interven-
tion of Z-drugs. Our results reveal perspectives relevant to the 
development of interventions that specifically address Z-drug 
use and insomnia. 
There are also limitations to our study. First, our small sample 
size may limit the generalizability of our results. Generalizabil-
ity may also be affected if our recruitment resulted in greater 
participation among patients who have specific concerns about 
nonbenzodiazepine use or clinicians who struggle more with 
medication use among older adults. In addition, most of our 
patient participants were female; thus, generalizability may be 
affected if there are sex-specific differences in perspectives on 
nonbenzodiazepine use and deprescribing. However, given the 
consistency of our feedback, we believe that we ascertained 
common perspectives that consider patient concerns and clini-
cian and health care system barriers. Our consistent use of an 
interview guide and the use of a formal content analysis help 
lessen these limitations.18 Second, our study was conducted in 
an integrated health care system, so institutional factors may 
differ from other settings. 
CONCLUSION
Our study found that both patients and primary care clini-
cians recognize the need for health care systems to prioritize 
effective insomnia treatment, provide education about nonben-
zodiazepine use, and offer support for the discontinuation of 
nonbenzodiazepines when necessary. Collectively, to encourage 
deprescribing and improve Z-drug use among older adults,

ABSTRACT 
Context: Research has linked adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) with chronic disease 
in adults and diminished life span. Adverse biological embedding of ACEs potentially oc-
curs through inflammatory mechanisms; inflammatory marker alterations are identified as 
candidate biomarkers for mediating health consequences. Lifestyle practices of residents of 
California’s Loma Linda Blue Zone, one of five worldwide longevity hotspots, may provide 
insight into inflammation remediation and chronic disease prevention. Little research has 
been done on centenarians’ early-life experiences or on ACEs in a longevity community. 
Objective: To interview centenarians and seniors in this region regarding their childhood 
experiences to inform chronic disease prevention frameworks. 
Design: Qualitative study of Loma Linda Blue Zone community members. Childhood 
exposures and practices were assessed using focus groups and semistructured key informant 
interviews, with open-ended questions on general hardships and ACEs and supplemented 
with lifestyle and resiliency factor questions. Data were audiorecorded and transcribed. 
Integrative grounded theory methods guided coding and theming.
Main Outcome Measures: Exposure to ACEs and practice of resiliency factors.
Results: Participants (7 centenarians and 29 seniors) reported exposure to multiple ACEs 
(domains: Economic deprivation, family dysfunction, and community violence). Community 
members reported practicing resiliency factors, each with anti-inflammatory properties 
suggesting mitigation of ACE-related toxic stress. 
Conclusion: This is one of the first studies of its kind to identify a community of resilient 
members despite their tremendous burden of ACEs. Embedding the identified resiliency 
factors into chronic disease prevention frameworks has potential for mitigating systemic 
inflammation, alleviating chronic disease burden, and promoting a culture of health. 
INTRODUCTION 
Chronic diseases are a major contribu-
tor to morbidity, mortality, and decreased 
quality of life and have become a national 
public health crisis.1,2 A growing body of 
scientific evidence has linked environ-
mental exposures and stressors in early 
life with the development of adult chronic 
diseases, ultimately decreasing life span.3,4 
Since the landmark Adverse Childhood 
Experiences (ACEs) Study, researchers 
have associated early-life adverse stress 
inflicted by extreme poverty, parental 
mental illness or incarceration, abuse, 
community violence, and other adverse 
experiences to later manifestations of 
diabetes, mental illness, cancer, chronic 
pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, 
obesity, and premature mortality.5-8 Left 
unabated, frequent or extreme activa-
tion of the body’s stress response system 
can become toxic, and in the absence of 
protective mechanisms, lasting adverse 
biological changes can occur.9
Researchers postulate that the em-
bedding of adverse biological changes 
associated with toxic chronic stress, such 
as those associated with ACEs, may be 
through inflammatory mechanisms; a 
growing body of research supports this 
theory.10-12 Furthermore, the inflam-
matory processes may commence in 
early-life as studies have revealed the 
ACE-associated increase in systemic in-
flammatory markers (C-reactive protein 
[CRP], fibrinogen, and proinflammatory 
cytokines) and biological changes already 
evident in childhood.11,13 Alterations in 
inflammatory markers are now identified 
as candidate biomarkers for mediating 
the health consequences associated with 
childhood adversities and subsequently 
improving healthy longevity.11 
Insight to reduce the growing preva-
lence of chronic diseases may be found in 
key communities around the world where 
individuals have exhibited increased resil-
ience and longevity. As researchers have 
identified the link between ACEs and 
health in adulthood, assessing hotspots 
with increased healthy longevity makes 
logical sense.3 Resilient centenarian and 
senior members of longevity hotspot com-
munities may have experiences in child-
hood but are able to mitigate ACE-related 
biological changes. Around the world, five 
communities—Sardinia, Italy; Nicoya, 
Costa Rica; Okinawa, Japan; Ikaria, 
Greece; and Loma Linda, CA, US—have 
been identified as “Blue Zones,” or lon-
gevity hotspots where members tend to 
live healthier and longer.14-20

America, and therefore having important

ORIGINAL RESEARCH & CONTRIBUTIONS
Adverse Childhood Experiences among a Community of Resilient Centenarians and Seniors: Implications for a Chronic Disease Prevention Framework 
implications for health throughout the 
US, is composed of Seventh-day Ad-
ventists, a religious group known for its 
healthy lifestyle. Adventists tend to con-
sume a greater vegetarian diet and refrain 
from using tobacco, alcohol, and illegal 
substances. Through one of the largest 
lifestyle cohort studies, the Adventist 
Health Study, researchers at Loma Linda 
University found lifestyle habits linked 
with an overall improvement in life 
expectancy that is significantly greater 
than that for the general US population 
as well as a reduction in chronic health 
conditions, especially those associated 
with states of chronic inflammation such 
as diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, 
high blood pressure, and cardiovascular 
disease.19,21-25 The increased healthy lon-
gevity of this population may have major 
implications for health promotion, espe-
cially with disease prevention founded in 
early childhood. 
Currently, limited research has been 
conducted assessing childhood experiences 
and exposures among centenarians, and to 
our knowledge, no such research has been 
conducted assessing ACEs or the poten-
tial for mitigating ACE-related adverse 
changes.26,27 With a history of significant 
longevity, the Loma Linda Blue Zone 
(LLBZ) community may provide a unique 
perspective for chronic disease prevention. 
Thus, the purpose of this research study 
was to obtain in-depth information from 
LLBZ centenarians and seniors about 
their childhood experiences and exposures 
and to provide insight for chronic disease 
prevention framework.
METHODS 
We conducted a qualitative study us-
ing grounded theory methods from No-
vember 2015 through January 2017 and 
included 25 key informant interviews 
(KIs), 2 focus groups, and analysis of a 
centenarian’s published memoir to gain 
insight into the childhood experiences of 
LLBZ members.28 The study was approved 
by Loma Linda University’s institutional 
review board. 
Participant Recruitment  
and Inclusion Criteria
Eligible participants were approached 
at various areas around the city, including 
community fairs, faith-based events, a 
local gym, and senior living facilities. In-
terested participants were later contacted 
by telephone to arrange an interview 
and to provide consent for participation. 
Participants were included in the study 
if they currently reside in the City of 
Loma Linda and were affiliated with the 
Seventh-day Adventist community. 
Key Informant Interviews and Focus Groups
KIs of 7 centenarians and 18 seniors, 
with a high participation rate (100% 
centenarians and 98% seniors), were 
conducted using a semistructured guide 
with open-ended questions on adversity 
and hardship as well as positive experi-
ences or resiliency factors (RFs) in their 
childhood. General ACE thematic areas 
were similar in nature to thematic areas 
of the ACE International Questionnaire 
(ACE-IQ).29 Resiliency factors are defined 
as factors that support adapting well in 
the face of adversity, stress, trauma, and so 
forth, and research studies have tended to 
focus on the psychosocial constructs, such 
as caring and supportive relationships.30 
In addition to the psychosocial aspects, 
we assessed healthy lifestyle practices (ie, 
diet, rest, time outdoors) as RFs. Inter-
views were conducted by trained bilingual 
(English and Spanish) facilitators and 
lasted between 30 and 50 minutes. Find-
ings from KIs informed development of 
the validation focus group guide. Con-
firmatory focus groups (n = 2) were con-
ducted among seniors (n = 11) by trained 
bilingual facilitators, which took place 
on the Loma Linda University campus 
and lasted between 60 and 90 minutes. 
Focus groups and the KI interviewees 
were mutually exclusive groups, and 
all were audiorecorded and transcribed 
verbatim. Excerpts from one centenar-
ian’s published memoir were collected 
and included in the data for coding and 
analysis.31 Sample size was determined 
using thematic saturation.
Qualitative Analysis
Once transcribed, textual data were 
analyzed using the constant compara-
tive method to develop a grounded 
theory model for our study. To ensure

Adverse Childhood Experiences among a Community of Resilient Centenarians and Seniors: Implications for a Chronic Disease Prevention Framework  
systematic data analysis, an iterative 
process of individual-level review and 
group-level review and interpretation was 
implemented with a multidisciplinary 
team. After team consensus on the final 
codes, coding continued with transcrip-
tions and the centenarian’s memoir until 
thematic saturation was reached. Themes 
were further refined by multiple readings 
of the transcripts and memoir, and con-
sensus was reached on the final themes 
through group discussion of the data. 
After analysis, participants were invited 
to a presentation on the study findings 
and subsequently approved our themes 
and model. 
Adverse Childhood Experiences  
and Resiliency Factors Score
Participants were defined as exposed to 
an ACE or an RF if they reported an ad-
verse or resiliency experience that occurred 
in the first 17 years of life. A total ACE 
and RF score was calculated by summing 
the number of categories with an ACE 
or resiliency-promoting factor to which 
a participant was exposed. The number 
of ACEs ranged from 0 (no exposure) to 
11 (all categories exposed); RFs ranged 
from 0 (no exposure) to 8 (all catego-
ries exposed). Descriptive statistics (eg, 
percentages) were used to describe study 
participants as well as ACEs and RFs.
RESULTS
Centenarian and Senior Characteristics
In total, 36 participants (7 centenarians 
and 29 seniors) provided data on ACEs 
and RFs. Ages ranged between 65 and 
102 years; most were women, US born, 
and white (Table 1). However, although 
more centenarians were white (57%), 
just 29% were born in the US. All the 
centenarians had lived in Loma Linda 
for 50 years or longer, except for one 
who had lived 5 years in the community. 
Centenarians lived by themselves (14%), 
with family members (57%), or at inde-
pendent living facilities (29%). Addition-
ally, all centenarians appeared in good

Adverse Childhood Experiences among a Community of Resilient Centenarians and Seniors: Implications for a Chronic Disease Prevention Framework 
overall health without report of chronic 
illness and reported regular involvement 
in social activities. Sixty-two percent of 
the senior participants were white, and 
most (72%) were born in the US. A high 
percentage were well on their way to be-
coming centenarians themselves. Similar 
to centenarians, seniors were active and 
independent.
Qualitative Themes
Adverse Childhood Exposures
Through qualitative analysis of the 
transcriptions, 3 domains (economic 
hardships, family dysfunction, and com-
munity violence) and 11 subdomains of 
adversity emerged (Table 2 and Figure 1). 
The economic hardships subdomains in-
cluded food deprivation and low house-
hold income. The family dysfunction 
subdomains included loss of parent, loss 
of sibling, family separation, parental ad-
diction, parental mental illness, parental 
physical abuse, and parental mental 
abuse. Last, the community violence 
subdomains included refugee status and 
witnessing violence. 
Among all study participants, the 
most reported adversities included low 
household income (53%), food depriva-
tion (44%), and family separation (44%). 
Nearly all participants experienced 
profound economic disadvantage that 
hindered food security, access to educa-
tion, and health care, and increased their 
odds of losing family members. Most 
participants (70%) had an ACE score of 
at least 1, and 36% had an ACE score of 
4 or greater. Among centenarians, 86% 
reported an ACE score of 4 or more. All 
centenarians reported low household in-
come and food deprivation; their families 
were subsistence farmers with extremely 
limited resources. The second most re-
ported ACE included family separation 
(71%), followed by loss of a parent (57%) 
caused by death or abandonment. A total 
of 43% reported parental mental abuse 
and felt their parents lacked love, sup-
port, parenting, and guidance. Similarly, 
43% reported witnessing violence in their 
communities in the form of exposure to 
beheadings and war activities. Most se-
niors (63%) had at least 1 ACE, and 25% 
reported 4 or more. Seniors reported hav-
ing grown up in various socioeconomic 
backgrounds and parental education 
levels, and experiencing low household 
income (41%), family separation (38%), 
and food deprivation (31%) mainly dur-
ing War World II, other regional wars, 
and the Great Depression in the US. 
Resiliency Factors
During analysis of the RFs, 8 themes 
emerged of childhood practices that were 
sustained across centenarians’ and seniors’ 
life spans (Table 3 and Figure 1). The 
themes included kinetic life, spiritual prac-
tices, a helping hand, family and friends’ 
camaraderie, nature engagement, resting 
reset, simple foods, and hopeful intrinsic 
drive. Nearly all study participants (88%) 
scored 4 or more RFs, and 39% had 7 or 
more. The most reported resiliency prac-
tice among all participants was family and 
friends’ camaraderie (83%). Participants 
noted strong and long-lasting social bonds 
with family members (mainly siblings) 
and friends, and reported that these rela-
tionships offered emotional support and 
understanding in times of adversity. The 
second most commonly cited practice 
was kinetic lifestyle (80%); participants 
described an outdoor lifestyle immersed 
in physical activity from dawn to dusk. 
Centenarians and seniors from farm-
ing families raised livestock, gardened, 
baked, and cared for younger siblings 
for the most part of the day. Addition-
ally, centenarians reported daily walks 
(2-3 hours) to school, a nearby town, a 
neighbor’s house, and church. Seniors 
raised in urban settings also walked 
daily to school, experienced long hours 
of outdoor play, and weekly nature hikes 
with their family and friends. Spiritual 
practices (78%) were also very common; 
most participants described involvement 
in family worship activities and com-
munity participation through regular 
church/temple attendance and involve-
ment in church ministries. Participants 
expressed diverse faith traditions during 
their early years of life. Consumption 
of simple foods was noted in 75% of 
participants, with home-grown foods, 
including abundance of vegetables and 
fruits, and limited meat. Their diets were 
modest, affordable, and mainly prepared 
at home. Regarding nature engagement

Adverse Childhood Experiences among a Community of Resilient Centenarians and Seniors: Implications for a Chronic Disease Prevention Framework  
for study participants (75%), especially 
those from rural villages or farming 
backgrounds, “nature” was a way to earn 
a living: Working the soil to grow food 
and raising cattle to sustain their families 
but also as an outlet for enjoyment. For 
seniors from urban communities, nature 
was explored and enjoyed with family 
and friends, a time for fun, exercise, and 
relaxation. Participants described routine 
sleeping habits, with at least 8 hours of 
sleep each day (resting reset, 69%). They 
commonly held the belief that their ac-
tions would result in positive outcomes 
in their life (hopeful intrinsic drive, 53%), 
and they regularly helped others with work 
(helping hand, 36%).
By study group, all centenarians were 
exposed to 6 or more RFs, and 58% of 
seniors noted exposure to 6 or more RFs. 
Like centenarians, seniors’ exposure to 
family and friends’ camaraderie (79%) 
was the highest, followed by kinetic life 
(76%), spiritual practices (76%), nature en-
gagement (69%), and simple foods (69%). 
Last, participants reported overlap on RF 
exposure and practice as they engaged in 
various factors concurrently. For example, 
although they indicated time in nature, 
they also cited participation in physical 
activity and friends’ camaraderie. 
DISCUSSION
Our study findings not only support 
the identification of resilient individuals 
but also, to our knowledge, are the first to 
identify a community of resilient mem-
bers despite their tremendous burden of 
ACEs. The RFs practiced in childhood 
remained present across their life spans 
and addressed multiple health domains 
(ie, mental, physical, spiritual, social).

Kinetic life
A lifestyle immersed in 
activities that require 
physical movement from 
early in the morning to 
evening
“I will give you a day in my life as a boy. I had to get up in the morning 
and go find the cows, and our place will be half a mile or so in 
dimension, so the cows will be away some place in the bush. Then 
you have to milk the cows and separate the milk, then eat breakfast, 
and then go to school. Now, going to school consisted of walking 2 
miles … so, you’d be up in the morning at 5:30 or 4.”

Spiritual 
practices
Familial faith-based 
values, traditions, and 
practices instilled since 
childhood
“I will never forget, she—mother—made me kneel down by the bed 
before we sleep, so she taught me a prayer, and I repeated that 
prayer for many, many years. And up to now I still kneel beside my 
bed before I go to sleep. And she brought us to church and made 
sure that we read the Bible stories.”

Helping hand
Charitable acts and 
altruism practiced in 
early life
“Our grandfather bought a house in town, next to the church. 
The teachers used to live in that house as well as children; we 
[centenarian and siblings] cooked and cleaned so that those kids will 
have a good place to stay.”

Extensive exposure 
to natural and outdoor 
environments
“We spent lots of time in nature, and we would go pick huckleberries

working, we would pick apples from apple orchards and run and play 
and do things like that.”

Resting reset
Weekly day of rest away 
from routine activities to 
rejuvenate physically and 
mentally with family and 
friends; and regular sleep 
patterns of at least 8 hours 
of rest at routine times
“Sabbath afternoon we looked forward to. My brothers went 
horseback riding. I did too, and it was just the time to be outside if we 
possibly could be. We went to a mountain about a half an hour from 
us, and we picnicked … there was always a place to go outside, be 
together, and picnic and that sort of thing.”

Simple foods
A homegrown and 
home-cooked diet high 
in vegetables and fruits 
with none or limited meat 
intake 
“We lived on a farm, and my mother baked great! She baked fresh 
bread, and we had lots of vegetables because my mother had a 
garden. We had fresh stuff all the time. She canned food in jars 
so in the winter time we had these things … no artificial anything; 
everything was good, simple food.”

Positive thoughts 
that one’s actions will

experiences
“A person has to bear in mind that you can’t allow circumstances to 
shape what your ultimate goal is. … [I’d] been out of school about 1 
year or 2, no money, nothing, and I was just walking alone one day, 
and I just got to thinking about the fact that I really wanted to be a 
doctor. I [didn’t] have any means, but I really wanted to be a doctor, 
and so I made up my mind to do so.”

Adverse Childhood Experiences among a Community of Resilient Centenarians and Seniors: Implications for a Chronic Disease Prevention Framework 
Their lifestyle was simple; they tended 
to live a more kinetic life, heavily engaged 
in nature and with many RFs practiced in 
tandem. Although the study participants 
endured tremendous childhood hardships 
with numerous ACEs, they were remark-
ably resilient, especially the centenarians. 
Evidence shows that ACEs are a major 
contributor to morbidity and mortality in 
adults with dose-response relationships 
between the number of ACEs and chronic 
diseases.5,32 With the strong relationship 
between ACEs, toxic stress, and adverse 
health outcomes, the question arises as 
to how the LLBZ community members, 
especially the centenarians, are able to 
achieve such resilient longevity despite 
enduring tremendous childhood adversity. 
Anti-inflammatory Properties
One important concept to consider re-
garding the longevity and resilience of the 
LLBZ is that each RF (kinetic life, spiritual 
practices, helping hand, family and friends’ 
camaraderie, nature engagement, resting 
reset, simple foods, and hopeful intrinsic 
drive) practiced by LLBZ centenarians 
and seniors has been found in independent 
studies to have anti-inflammatory prop-
erties (Table 4).33-54 Overall, the LLBZ 
community members lived a highly physi-
cally active life, and numerous independent 
studies have shown that this type of activ-
ity is significantly linked to a reduction 
in systemic inflammatory markers.42-44 In 
general, it is well known that increased 
systemic inflammation is a risk factor for 
increase in chronic diseases and reduc-
tion in life span.55-58 The practice of these 
health principles since early childhood may 
have afforded the centenarians and seniors 
enhanced ability to counter the effects of

Adverse Childhood Experiences among a Community of Resilient Centenarians and Seniors: Implications for a Chronic Disease Prevention Framework  
toxic stress and inflammation. Further-
more, the possibility exists that the RFs 
may interact synergistically, where the full 
impact is greater than the sum of individual 
components. Our study findings identify a 
theory that the anti-inflammatory practices 
that began in early childhood potentially 
mitigated the negative biological impact of 
toxic stress and childhood adversities and 
potentially enable the LLBZ community 
members, especially the centenarians, to 
live a significantly longer life span with 
less chronic disease. 
Biological Mechanism 
The mechanism behind childhood stress 
and health status later in life has not been 
fully elucidated. However, there may be 
an overlap between the mechanisms for 
longevity and that of the ACE-related 
biological embedding of toxic stress. 
With the knowledge that chronic disease 
in adults and shortening of life may have 
roots stemming from childhood exposures, 
an understanding of the biological mecha-
nisms for longevity is important and has 
implications for early childhood health 
promotion. One of the longevity theories 
is that of “inflamm-aging” in which low-
grade, chronic systemic inflammation 
increases over time because of the natural 
aging process and increases the risk of de-
veloping chronic disease.59 Interleukin-6, 
tumor necrosis factor-α, and CRP have 
been identified as a few of the major po-
tential inflammatory markers involved in 
the “inflamm-aging” process. It has been 
hypothesized that individuals living ex-
ceptionally long, healthy lives, such as the 
LLBZ centenarians, are better able to cope 
with stress and the inflammatory load and 
are subsequently able to slow or mitigate 
the “inflamm-aging” process. Further sup-
porting this theory, a large body of pub-
lished studies have identified a wide range 
of adult chronic diseases (ie, diabetes, 
cardiovascular disease, cancer) associated 
with states of chronic inflammation and 
life shortening.60-62 On the resiliency side, 
a recent study of psychosocial-related RFs 
(ie, attending social engagements) found 
an association with a reduction in inflam-
matory markers in adults who had experi-
enced multiple ACEs.63 More research is 
needed to better understand how the RFs 
may work together to promote resilience. 
Genetic Diversity and  
Low-Income Implications
There are a couple of additional points 
for consideration in supporting the 
strength of lifestyle influencing resilience 
and longevity. There has been a large 
amount of research focused on genes 
(eg, FOXO3) and their identified associa-
tion with enhanced longevity.64,65 How-
ever, one point to consider is that differing 
from the other Blue Zones throughout the 
world, the LLBZ is a genetically diverse 
group, especially among centenarians be-
cause they come from countries around 
the globe. What they had in common 
was healthy lifestyle practices, which po-
tentially gives insight into the strength of 
their lifestyle practices influencing resil-
ience and longevity in this community. 
The second point to consider is that the 
LLBZ centenarians and seniors reported 
disadvantaged backgrounds with fewer 
resources. In general, household income 
has been found linked to poorer health 
outcomes and premature death, and child-
hood poverty predictive of age-related dis-
ease risks, such as elevated inflammation 
levels and the clustering of metabolic risk 
factors in adulthood.66-68 Interestingly, the 
Nicoya, Costa Rica, and Okinawa, Japan, 
Blue Zone communities are also composed 
of some of the lowest income households 
compared with their surrounding regions 
yet have been recognized as experiencing 
some of the best survival rates in their re-
spective countries.16,69 The LLBZ findings 
and evidence from Nicoya and Okinawa 
Blue Zone communities provide addi-
tional support for the strength of lifestyle 
factors influencing resiliency and longevity.
Informing Chronic Disease  
Prevention Framework
The findings from our research study 
have potential implications for informing 
chronic disease prevention frameworks 
and improving the health of our nation. 
One of the main goals of Healthy People 
2020, an initiative striving to improve 
the health of all Americans, is to attain 
high-quality, longer lives free of pre-
ventable disease, disability, injury, and 
premature death.70 The RFs identified in 
our study, which have individually been 
supported by independent research stud-
ies, can help to enhance current existing 
chronic disease prevention frameworks to 
promote a culture of health. 
Key stakeholders can significantly 
influence exposure to the RFs within 
the chronic disease framework. Health 
professionals, a critical key stakeholder, 
can bring awareness for factors and work 
to promote practicing of factors through 
conversation. Start the conversation on 
RFs with children and their families, even 
if only one or two sentences. Another key 
stakeholder critical in supporting a shift 
toward a culture of health is medical fa-
cilities/hospitals and their administrators 
because they could promote RFs in their 
facility, encouraging wide-ranging expo-
sure to the RFs. Additionally, this stake-
holder group could develop innovative 
collaborations with community organiza-
tions (ie, museums, libraries, faith-based 
agencies, health departments) to promote 
community awareness and recognition 
for the RFs. There is a critical need for 
delivering health messages not only in the 
health sector but also across the nonhealth 
sectors. A fourth key stakeholder group, 
which is important in promoting a culture 
of health, is elected government officials 
and politicians. Given the latest knowl-
edge on the critical importance of early 
child exposures and subsequent chronic 
disease development, government officials 
and politicians in charge of spending al-
location should critically rethink current 
funding priorities. This change will ensure 
significant and increased level of funding 
targeting programs for early childhood, 
especially those with health components. 
In supporting innovative collaborations, 
greater investments are needed for health 
promotion and disease prevention research 
and programs for young children. A fifth 
The [Loma Linda Blue Zone] findings and evidence from Nicoya and 
Okinawa Blue Zone communities provide additional support for the 
strength of lifestyle factors influencing resiliency and longevity.

key stakeholder group, educational institu-
tions and systems, could also facilitate pro-
moting a culture of health via embedding 
of the RFs with their school systems and 
providing an environment that is support-
ive. Last, policy personnel is a potential key 
stakeholder group that could drive forward 
change by embedding RFs in their policy 
development initiatives. 
Limitations
Our study has some limitations that 
merit discussion. One potential limitation 
is the limited generalizability of this study 
because it included only centenarians and 
seniors currently living in the LLBZ. 
However, the LLBZ centenarian and 
seniors included a wide age range, greatly 
differing ethnic background, and differ-
ing countries of origin. Similarly, there 
may be limited generalizability using the 
ACEs experienced because communities 
in the US may differ by the type of ACE 
exposures. Another potential limitation 
may be with the participants’ ability to 
recall early-life experiences, with most par-
ticipants likely underreporting resiliency 
practices and adverse exposures, especially 
for the oldest members. However, most 
of the centenarians and older seniors had 
family members present at the interview 
corroborating the information provided. 
Additionally, because this was a qualita-
tive study in nature, further quantitative 
research studies are warranted to confirm 
and expand on our findings. 
CONCLUSION
The LLBZ is a community known 
to have enhanced longevity and fewer 
chronic diseases. Our findings support 
that the optimal health of these commu-
nity members may potentially be guided 
by resiliency-promoting factors, each with 
anti-inflammatory properties, which are 
established in childhood and maintained 
across the life span. Early-life interventions 
targeting lifestyle behaviors are emerging as 
a promising area of focus for reducing the 
epidemic of chronic disease. The identifi-
cation of the childhood RFs among this 
community has characterized potential 
foundational cornerstones on which to 
build a framework for promoting a culture 
of health for the US. Future research studies 
are warranted assessing health intervention 
approaches as informed by these RFs. In 
addition, research studies of childhood 
experiences (positive and negative) among 
other worldwide longevity regions and 
among centenarians are warranted and hold 
promise for addressing global pediatric tox-
ic stress. With emphasis on early-life health 
promotion, we can alleviate the burden of 
chronic disease and enable a collaborative 
movement toward a more resilient country 
of wellness and longevity. v

ABSTRACT 
Context: Survival for patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) has 
remained relatively stagnant despite advances in treatment. Few studies have examined 
why advanced-stage disease is diagnosed in 40% of patients with OCSCC nationally. 
Objective: To characterize the diagnostic pathway of OCSCC in an integrated health 
care system. 
Design: Retrospective study of patients with OCSCC (2007-2010).
Main Outcome Measures: Referral patterns and demographic, clinical, and tumor 
characteristics associated with time to diagnosis (diagnostic interval). 
Results: Of 247 patients, 167 (68%) had early-stage (I/II) disease, 86 (35%) were referred 
by dentists, and 70 (28%) had a history of premalignancy. The median time (interquartile 
range) from symptom onset to care sought from a primary care physician (patient interval), 
from primary care physician to otolaryngologist, and from otolaryngologist to diagnosis was 
8.6 (4.0-25.8), 1.0 (0.6-3.1), 0.0 (0.0-3.0) weeks, respectively. These intervals did not differ by 
demographic characteristics, clinical factors, or tumor stage. Prolonged diagnostic intervals 
were observed among patients with premalignant lesions.
Conclusion: The patient interval was the largest component of the total diagnostic 
interval. The subsequent professional workup proceeded relatively efficiently. Prolonged 
diagnostic interval in patients with premalignant lesions may reflect the natural history of 
malignant transformation rather than a delay in diagnosis. However, nearly one-fourth of 
these cases were diagnosed at an advanced stage; closer surveillance may represent an 
opportunity for diagnosis at an earlier stage. Surveillance for premalignant lesions and 
facilitating referrals from dentists may expedite the diagnosis and treatment of OCSCC. 
Further investigation is warranted.
INTRODUCTION
Survival for squamous cell carcinoma 
of the oral cavity has not improved greatly 
since the 1980s, despite tremendous 
research efforts and advancements in 
technology.1 One reason for this may be 
the stable rate of diagnosis at advanced-
stage disease.1 Unlike other, more com-
mon cancers, which have benefited from 
cancer screening and earlier detection, 
efforts toward improving earlier diagnosis 
of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma 
(OCSCC) have been relatively limited. 
Proper examination of most of the up-
per aerodigestive tract requires flexible 
endoscopic equipment, which is rarely 
available outside the otolaryngologist’s 
office. However, the oral cavity allows for 
relatively easy visualization without special 
instrumentation. Despite this accessibility, 
40% of oral cavity cancers are still diag-
nosed with regionally metastatic disease 
and 6% with distant metastatic disease.1 
Not only does late-stage disease portend a 
poorer survival compared with early-stage 
disease, treatment of late-stage disease en-
tails much more extensive treatment and 
results in a poorer quality of life.2-6 
Opportunities to reduce diagnostic 
delays in oral cavity cancer may exist for 
which detecting more disease at an earlier 
stage could result in improved survival 
and reduced morbidity. Few studies have 
examined the diagnostic pathway of oral 
cavity cancer and assessed whether delays 
commonly occur in the US population. In 
a large population cohort of patients with 
OCSCC, this study aims to 1) measure 
the patient and professional time intervals 
to diagnosis (diagnostic intervals) and the 
factors associated with these intervals, 2) 
identify risk factors associated with late-
stage disease presentation, and 3) examine 
the referral patterns of patients with oral 
cavity cancer to an otolaryngologist. 
METHODS 
A retrospective cohort study was con-
ducted in Kaiser Permanente Northern 
California (KPNC), a large integrated 
health care system. The cohort was com-
posed of unique cases of oral cavity tumors 
diagnosed from January 1, 2007, through 
December 31, 2010. These cases were iden-
tified from a source population obtained 
from the KPNC Cancer Registry by the 
International Classification of Diseases for 
Oncology, Third Edition (ICD-O-3) site 
and histology codes. The KPNC Cancer 
Registry is a database containing all verified 
in situ and invasive cancers from KPNC 
medical facilities reported to the California 
Cancer Registry and the Survival, Epidemi-
ology, and End-Results (SEER) program 
of the National Cancer Institute. 
A total of 462 cases of oral cavity can-
cers were identified in the KPNC Cancer 
Registry. Fifty-one cases did not meet 
the following inclusion criteria: Age at 
diagnosis of 18 years or older, tumor

histology of squamous cell carcinoma, 
and ICD-O-3 site code specific for the 
oral cavity. A systematic chart review was 
then conducted to exclude cases caused 
by a second primary tumor, tumor recur-
rence, or misdiagnosed subsite, or if the 
documentation was deemed inadequate 
to determine patient and professional di-
agnostic intervals (n = 105). A final series 
of criteria was applied to the unique 306 
OCSCC cases, allowing for the further 
exclusion of patients whose tumor was 
identified as a carcinoma in situ, who saw 
an oral surgeon or non-KPNC otolaryn-
gologist/head and neck surgeon before the 
KPNC primary care physician (PCP) or 
otolaryngologist, who were not treated, or 
who were missing data on patient diagnos-
tic interval. The final sample consisted of 
247 cases (Figure 1).
Demographic and lifestyle data were 
obtained from the KPNC Cancer Reg-
istry and the electronic medical record, 
including sex, age at tumor diagnosis, race/
ethnicity, tobacco use history, and alcohol 
intake history. Clinical history data in-
cluded tumor subsite, dental referral status, 
primary presenting symptom, presence of 
premalignant lesions, neck dissection status, 
treatment received, and final disease state. 
Additional temporal data were collected 
on the time between a patient’s first symp-
toms and the date when the patient pre-
sented to the PCP (patient interval), the 
time from the initial PCP visit until the 
date of pathologic diagnosis (professional 
interval), the combined total diagnostic 
time from patient symptoms to the date of 
pathologic diagnosis (diagnostic interval), 
and the total time from first symptom to 
time of treatment (total interval). Defini-
tions used for patient and professional 
diagnostic intervals were consistent with 
those used in prior studies.4,7-10 When 
this information was not available in the 
PCP’s documentation, the patient diag-
nostic interval was extrapolated from the 
otolaryngologist’s notation.
Tumor Stages I, II, III, and IV were 
derived from the tumor, node, metastasis 
(TNM) classification system, according to 
the American Joint Committee on Can-
cer (AJCC),11 and ascertained from the 
KPNC Cancer Registry using the North 
American Association of Central Cancer 
Registries’ nationally standardized software 
algorithm and verified using chart review. 
If TNM staging was not available in the 
KPNC Cancer Registry, a chart review 
was conducted to assign the clinical stage. 
Descriptive statistics were generated for 
the 247 OCSCC cases, to examine fre-
quency distributions of demographic (sex, 
age, race/ethnicity), lifestyle (tobacco and 
alcohol intake history), and clinical char-
acteristics (tumor stage, tumor subsite, 
referred by dentist, primary presenting 
symptoms, presence of premalignant le-
sions, neck dissection status, treatment 
received, and final disease state). De-
scriptive statistics also were generated 
to examine measures of dispersion for 
the different intervals (patient, profes-
sional, treatment, diagnostic, and total). 
Bivariate analyses were used to assess 
variations in early stage (Stages I and II) 
vs late tumor stage (Stages III and IV) 
and intervals according to demographic, 
lifestyle, and clinical characteristics. 
Chi-square tests were used to compare 
categorical variables. T-tests and non-
parametric tests (Wilcoxon rank sum or 
Kruskal-Wallis) were used to compare 
continuous variables. All analyses were 
conducted using statistical software 
(SAS 9.3, SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). 
The Kaiser Foundation Research Insti-
tute’s institutional review board approved 
this study with a waiver of consent. 
RESULTS 
Demographic, lifestyle, and clinical 
characteristics of the 247 unique OCSCC 
cases are presented overall and according 
to tumor stage (Tables 1 and 2). Two-
thirds (67.7%, n = 167) of the cases had

a history of tobacco use (17.8% were cur-
rent users, and 43.7% were former users) 
and of alcohol consumption (45.3% were 
current drinkers, and 10.5% were former 
drinkers). None of the demographic or 
lifestyle characteristics were associated 
with tumor stage. 
Regarding clinical characteristics, the 
most common oral cavity tumor subsites 
were the tongue (61.9%) and floor of 
mouth (16.2%). The most common pri-
mary presenting symptoms were tongue 
pain and lesions (61.1%) and floor-of-
mouth lesions in the nontongue category 
(12.2%). More than one-third (35%) of 
cases involved a referral by a dentist. His-
tory of a premalignant lesion was reported 
for 70 cases (28.3%), and of these, 17 
(24.3%) presented with late-stage disease 
at the time of diagnosis. Leukoplakia and 
dysplasia were the most common types of 
lesions (60% and 16%, respectively). Ap-
proximately half (51.3%) of patients with 
late-stage tumor died during follow-up, 
compared with 28.1% of those with early-
stage tumor (p < 0.0001). 
Among the 247 OCSCC cases, 213 had 
complete data for the number of weeks 
from their initial PCP visit until the first 
otolaryngologist visit (presumably after 
referral). All other intervals include all 
247 cases. Between the onset of symptoms 
and the initial visit to the PCP, 119 cases 
(48%) had a delay of more than 3 months 
(12 weeks). Patients experienced symp-
toms for a median of 8.6 weeks (range = 
0-520 weeks; interquartile range (IQR) = 
4.0-25.8) before presenting to the PCP 
(Table 3). This initial period, before the 
patient engaged with the medical system, 
contributed the most time on the pathway 
to treatment. 
Between the first clinician visit to the 
PCP (or directly to the otolaryngologist 
for the 34 patients who “bypassed” the 
PCP) and the date of pathologic (tumor) 
diagnosis, 65 patients (26%) had a delay of 
more than 2 months (8 weeks). The median 
elapsed time between the initial presenta-
tion to a PCP and the tumor diagnosis, the 
professional diagnostic interval (Table 3), 
was only 2 weeks (IQR = 0.6-8.6), with the 
median time from the PCP to the otolar-
yngologist occurring within 1 week (IQR 
= 0.6-3.1), and the median time from the 
otolaryngologist visit to the tumor diag-
nosis occurring on the same day (0 weeks, 
IQR = 0-3.0; data not shown). The median 
time from when the tumor diagnosis took 
place to the time of initial treatment was 
3.9 weeks (IQR = 2.6-5.9), contributing 
to a total interval from symptom onset 
to treatment of 21.1 weeks (IQR = 11.0-
54.0), as shown in Table 3. 
There were no significant differences in 
the underlying distributions of the various 
intervals, according to demographic and 
lifestyle characteristics or tumor stage 
(Table 3). However, differences were seen 
among patients who were initially referred 
by a dentist, compared with those who 
were not referred by a dentist, for the 
diagnostic interval (median = 25.8 weeks, 
IQR = 11.7-52.9 weeks; vs 13.9 weeks, 
IQR = 5.3-39.1 weeks; p = 0.02) and for 
total interval (median = 29.4 weeks, IQR 
= 15.7-56.0 weeks; vs 17.8 weeks, IQR = 
10.0-45.2 weeks; p = 0.03). Patients with 
premalignant lesions, compared with those 
without, had a longer professional interval 
(median = 7.9 weeks, IQR = 1.0-53.0; vs 
1.4 weeks, IQR = 0.3-4.6; p < 0.0001) and 
diagnostic interval (median = 43.2 weeks, 
IQR = 12.6-113.2 weeks; vs 13.8 weeks, 
IQR = 5.3-32.6; p < 0.0001). Patients with 
premalignant lesions also had a longer 
total interval (median = 46.2 weeks, IQR 
= 16.8-120.3 weeks; vs 18.0 weeks, IQR 
= 10.0-39.7 weeks; p < 0.0001).

Diagnostic Pathway of Oral Cavity Cancer in an Integrated Health Care System 
DISCUSSION
Our study, conducted in a diverse inte-
grated health care delivery system, is one 
of the first from the medical literature to 
investigate diagnostic pathways in oral cav-
ity cancer within a US population. The time 
between the patient’s initial symptoms and 
the first encounter with the PCP accounted 
for most of the delay in diagnosis and ulti-
mately treatment. A statistically significant 
portion (28%) of patients had a previous 
diagnosis of a premalignant condition, and 
35% were referred by a dentist. These find-
ings support further investigation into av-
enues to reduce diagnostic delay, including 
surveillance of patients with premalignant 
lesions and streamlining of the dentist-
otolaryngologist specialist referral process. 
The patient interval was found to be 
the largest component of the total di-
agnostic interval, a finding consistent 
with similar studies.7,12,13 We found no 
significant variations in the underlying 
distributions of patient intervals by early 
and late-stage disease; patients presenting 
at all stages waited a median of 8.6 weeks 
before initially seeing their PCP. This lack 
of relationship between diagnostic delays 
and stage of disease at initial presentation 
has been observed not only in studies of 
head and neck cancers14 but also in stud-
ies of other cancer subsites, including 
colorectal, lung, endometrial, and cervical 
cancers.15-18 In fact, for some cancers such 
as medulloblastoma, it has been found 
that shorter intervals from patient onset 
of symptoms to clinical presentation are 
correlated with a decreased survival.15 
Some cancer investigators have proposed 
that tumor growth rate, rather than patient 
diagnostic interval, is the preeminent fac-
tor that affects the stage of presentation. It 
is hypothesized that tumor growth rate has 
a greater influence on stage of presentation 
rather than the period of symptoms.15,18 
Fast-growing cancers might present with 
short symptom intervals and late-stage 
disease, whereas slow-growing cancers 
might present with mild symptoms that 
the patient disregards for some time, but 
the cancer remains early stage when di-
agnosed. Late-stage tumors are theorized 
to express more overt symptoms including 
pain and bleeding, are more conspicu-
ous on clinical examination, and are less 
likely to be misdiagnosed, which may 
paradoxically shorten diagnostic intervals 
for late-stage disease.16 In the oral cavity, 
this confounding factor may explain why 
we failed to find a temporal relationship 
between diagnostic intervals and stage of 
disease. However, earlier diagnosis allows 
treatment initiation of fewer cancer cells, 
increasing treatment success. 
After patients with OCSCC presented 
to the PCP, their subsequent management 
was performed efficiently. The median 
time from PCP to otolaryngologist and 
from otolaryngologist to diagnosis was 1 
week (IQR = 0.6-3.1 weeks) and 0 weeks 
(IQR = 0-3.0 weeks), respectively. This di-
agnostic efficiency may reflect the advan-
tages of an integrated health care system, 
where the PCPs can call specialists during 
the initial patient visit and arrange for 
same-day appointments when clinically 
indicated. The median time from diagno-
sis to treatment was 3.9 weeks, which is 
similar to data from the National Cancer 
Database.19 That national study of more 
than 50,000 patients with head and neck 
cancer found that a treatment delay of 
2 weeks was associated with worse sur-
vival.19 Although the study did not report 
information pertaining to the diagnostic 
intervals, one can infer that decreasing 
diagnostic delays may confer survival 
benefit as well.

Diagnostic Pathway of Oral Cavity Cancer in an Integrated Health Care System 
Seventy patients (28.3%) were given a 
diagnosis of a premalignant lesion before 
the OCSCC diagnosis. The premalignant 
diagnoses include leukoplakia (diagnosed 
clinically), dysplasia (diagnosed with 
biopsy), and lichen planus. The profes-
sional interval was longer for these patients; 
however, this may reflect the natural history 
of malignant transformation rather than 
a delay in diagnosis. Nearly one-fourth 
(24.3%) of these patients with known pre-
malignant lesions received a subsequent di-
agnosis of late-stage disease. The treatment 
and surveillance of premalignant lesions 
was not captured in our data collection; 
however, anecdotally, management seemed 
to be performed in variable fashion. Patients 
with known premalignant lesions may 
represent an opportunity for improvement 
through prevention or closer surveillance 
and detection of disease at an earlier stage.

Diagnostic Pathway of Oral Cavity Cancer in an Integrated Health Care System 
Dentists played a key role in our case 
population, referring more than one-third 
of the patients (35%) for evaluation, al-
though this referral process is often not 
coordinated directly in our Health Plan. 
Inferring from the PCP records, it ap-
pears that dentists most often encouraged 
patients with suspicious oral lesions to 
see their PCP, and rarely was direct com-
munication between the PCP and the 
dentist documented in the health record. 
Furthermore, timing of the dental visit 
was generally not recorded, and there-
fore the time between the dental visit 
and first PCP visit is unknown and may 
represent a substantial professional delay. 
Also, among the 121 cases (of the 306 re-
tained after completion of medical record 
review; Figure 1) referred by dentists, 18% 
were referred to oral surgeons for biopsy 
when oral cavity cancer was suspected. 
In our health care environment, although 
oral surgeons sometimes perform biop-
sies, they rarely treat oral cavity cancers. 
These referrals, therefore, created an un-
necessary additional step in the diagnostic 
pathway, allowing more opportunities for 
delayed patient presentation. 
The American Dental Association 
recommends that patients receive rou-
tine oral examinations at least once 
a year.20 Although the US Preventive 
Services Task Force states that there is 
insufficient evidence to recommend oral 
cavity cancer screening,21 opportunistic 
screening examinations by dental pro-
fessionals exhibit promise as an avenue 
to improve identification of disease and 
shorten the interval between symptoms 
of disease and initial visit with a PCP. 
Although the American Dental Asso-
ciation does not recommend any formal 
OCSCC screening, it does recommend 
that dentists and dental hygienists “re-
main alert for signs of potentially malig-
nant lesions or early-stage cancers in all 
patients while performing routine visual 
and tactile examinations, particularly 
for patients who use tobacco or who 
are heavy consumers of alcohol.”22 Two 
studies from the UK demonstrated that 
dental professionals had diagnostic sen-
sitivities of 71% and 74%, respectively, in 
identifying oral cavity premalignant and 
malignant lesions.23,24 Surveys demon-
strate that dentists are more knowledge-
able concerning symptoms and signs of 
oral cavity cancer compared with PCPs25 
and play a vital role in the detection of 
OCSCC. With 62% of American adults 
actually seeing their dentist every year,26 
encouraging these preventive dental vis-
its, especially for patients at high risk of 
OCSCC, may help in the earlier detec-
tion of suspicious lesions. Partnering 
with our dental colleagues and enabling 
them to directly refer patients to an 
otolaryngologist specialist may reduce 
diagnostic delay.
Several limitations should be noted in 
the interpretation of our findings. First, 
because of the retrospective nature of our 
study, there may be patient recall bias in 
the reporting of the duration and quality 
of their symptoms. Patient intervals were, 
at times, documented with vague lan-
guage, when symptom duration was re-
corded with nebulous language such as “a 
few” or “a couple.” This was best mitigated 
by assigning standard numerical values to 
each term, which were kept consistent 
throughout the study. Furthermore, data 
for patient risk factors regarding tobacco 
and alcohol use were not consistently 
documented, hence precluding meaning-
ful analysis of these factors. 
The strengths of this study include 
that it is one of the first to comprehen-
sively assess the diagnostic pathways 
for oral cavity cancer within a large US 
community-based integrated health 
care delivery system serving a diverse 
patient population. Study of diagnostic 
delay is difficult in other American 
practice settings and from other data 
sources. At many academic centers, a 
large proportion of their cases are di-
agnosed elsewhere, and therefore the 
data regarding their diagnostic pathway 
may not be readily available. National 
databases such as SEER and the Na-
tional Cancer Database do not collect 
data before the date of diagnosis. The 
integration of our system allows for 
coordination of services between the 
PCPs and the otolaryngologists. Use of 
KPNC’s integrated electronic medical 
record with linkage to electronic data-
bases and disease registries allowed for 
accurate capture of demographic and 
professional diagnostic intervals, which 
were further validated by chart review. 
CONCLUSION
The patient diagnostic time interval 
has shown to be the largest component 
of the total diagnostic interval. Once 
patients presented to the physician, the 
diagnostic pathway proceeded relatively 
efficiently. Patients with premalignant 
lesions should be regularly monitored 
to increase the likelihood of diagnosis 
at early stages of disease as well as early 
treatment of the tumor after pathologi-
cally confirmed diagnosis. Collaborating 
with dentists and streamlining the referral 
process to otolaryngologists may be an 
avenue to screen patients for malignancy 
that merits further investigation. v

So Great an Evil
Cancers of the tongue and mouth begin with a small hard lump,

and they spread in the same manner with cancerous sores in other parts.  
This is so great an evil, that the slightest suspicion of it occasions very great uneasiness.

ABSTRACT
Context: Naloxone distribution has historically been implemented in a community-based, 
expanded public health model; however, there is now a need to further explore primary 
care clinic-based naloxone delivery to effectively address the nationwide opioid epidemic.
Objective: To create a general medicine infrastructure to identify patients with high-risk 
opioid use and provide 25% of this population with naloxone autoinjector prescription and 
training within a 6-month period. 
Design: The quality improvement study was conducted at an outpatient clinic serving 
1238 marginally housed veterans with high rates of comorbid substance use and mental 
health disorders. Patients at high risk of opioid-related adverse events were identified using 
the Stratification Tool for Opioid Risk Management and were contacted to participate in a 
one-on-one, 15-minute, hands-on naloxone training led by nursing staff. 
Main Outcome Measures: The number of patients identified at high risk and rates of 
naloxone training/distribution.
Results: There were 67 patients identified as having high-risk opioid use. None of these 
patients had been prescribed naloxone at baseline. At the end of the intervention, 61 pa-
tients (91%) had been trained in the use of naloxone. Naloxone was primarily distributed 
by licensed vocational nurses (42/61, 69%).
Conclusion: This study demonstrates the feasibility of high-risk patient identification 
and of a primary care-based and nursing-championed naloxone distribution model. This 
delivery model has the potential to provide access to naloxone to a population of patients 
with opioid use who may not be engaged in mental health or specialty care.
INTRODUCTION
Deaths caused by opioid overdose— 
both heroin and prescription opioids—
have tripled in the US since 2010, and 
opioid use has now formally been recog-
nized as a national epidemic.1,2 Veterans 
have high rates of pain and mental health 
disorders, such as posttraumatic stress 
disorder, as well as concomitant benzo-
diazepine and opioid use, placing them 
at particularly high risk of opioid-related 
accidents and overdose.3,4 As such, veter-
ans are estimated to die of opioid over-
dose at twice the national average rate.5 
Naloxone is an opioid antagonist previ-
ously used primarily in hospital settings 
to reverse fatal respiratory depression 
owing to opiate overdose. The escalation 
of opioid overdoses has led commu-
nity organizations to distribute naloxone 
widely among individuals with high-risk 
use.6-8 In 2014, the Department of Veter-
ans Affairs (VA) implemented the Opi-
oid Overdose Education and Naloxone 
Distribution (OEND) program, which 
aims to provide veterans with naloxone 
and trains them to administer it prop-
erly. Despite the implementation of this 
program, no formal workflow procedures 
existed in our VA Community-Based 
Outpatient Clinic for the distribution 
of naloxone kits, and no kits had been 
distributed to high-risk patients in our 
clinic before October 2015.
With the input of key clinic stakehold-
ers, a multidisciplinary team composed of 
internal medicine residents, a psychology 
trainee, registered nurses (RNs), and li-
censed vocational nurses (LVNs) set the 
goal of increasing both the distribution 
of naloxone autoinjectors and training 
in their appropriate use to our high-risk 
veteran population. The primary aim of the 
project was to develop the infrastructure to 
provide naloxone kits and training to 25% 
of patients at high-risk of opioid-related 
adverse events within 6 months. The ob-
jective was selected with consideration of 
attainability given the finite period of the 
resident quality improvement program.
METHODS
Setting
The study was conducted at an outpa-
tient clinic engaging marginally housed 
veterans (defined as those who are without 
housing or are living in transitional living 
programs or in single-room occupancy 
units) who have high rates of comorbid 
substance use and mental health disor-
ders. The clinic provides comprehen-
sive services, including medical, mental 
health, social work, and substance use 
treatment, as well as housing referrals for 
veterans. The medical staff includes five 
primary care practitioners (PCPs), six 
internal medicine residents, three RNs, 
and three LVNs.
Planning the Intervention
The planning phase of this work began 
in October 2015. At that time, no patients 
with high-risk opioid use had been pre-
scribed naloxone. This quality intervention

Naloxone Distribution and Training for Patients with High-Risk Opioid Use in a Veterans Affairs Community-Based Primary Care Clinic
was deemed exempt from the need for 
institutional review board approval.
The implementation phase took place 
from November 2015 to March 2016. 
There were three key elements of the 
planned intervention. The first was the 
identification of patients with high-risk 
opiate use. This identification was com-
pleted using a national VA dashboard 
known as the Stratification Tool for 
Opioid Risk Management (STORM) in 
which real-time, patient-specific data re-
garding comorbidities, mental health, sub-
stance use, and opioid/sedating medication 
use are utilized to determine three-year 
risk of opioid-related adverse outcomes.9 
The second phase of this intervention 
was the education of clinic staff (LVNs, 
RNs, and physicians) about counseling 
patients on naloxone use. This was initially 
done through 30- to 60-minute, in-person 
training sessions led by a medical center 
pharmacist dedicated to the OEND proj-
ect.10,11 There were no formal posttraining 
assessments performed to evaluate com-
petency; some nursing staff did elect to 
be directly observed by a physician dur-
ing their first patient counseling experi-
ence. Reinforcement education was done 
through online educational videos. 
The final element of this intervention 
was the distribution of naloxone to pa-
tients. In this phase, high-risk patients 
were contacted using a tiered and multi-
faceted approach. A champion LVN at-
tempted contact with identified patients 
first by telephone and then by letter, 
inviting them to the clinic for safety edu-
cation regarding their opioid medication 
or opioid recreational use. For patients 
unable to be engaged by these methods, 
in-person contact was attempted while the 
patient was at the clinic for either medical 
or psychosocial services. To identify when 
these patients would be physically present 
in the clinic, a portion of the medical team 
“huddle” each morning was dedicated to 
reviewing the clinic schedule for high-
risk patients.
The patient training consisted of 
15-minute verbal discussion of signs of 
opioid overdose, administration of nal-
oxone, and the importance of contacting 
emergency services.10 If additional train-
ing was needed, patients were referred 
to a training video.10 Primary supports 
for patients were also invited to attend; 
however, given the social isolation of 
this patient population, it was rare for 
an individual other than the patient to 
participate. 
The initial Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) 
cycle included the quantitative (time/ses-
sion, use of media) and qualitative (sub-
jective assessment of educator comfort, 
patient receptiveness) evaluation of several 
patient education encounters. From this 
study, we found it easier to engage pa-
tients in the conversation about naloxone 
if we normalized the use of naloxone as a 
medication (ie, comparison to epinephrine 
injection [EpiPen]) and emphasized its 
role in aiding other social contacts such 
friends or family members who use opioids 
(ie, service to others). This content was 
then added to the outline of the naloxone 
training discussions. To aid our LVN staff 
in providing comprehensive education, we 
developed an automated clinic note tem-
plate, which was completed by the trainer 
during the session. 
To minimize prescriber/physician effort, 
the staff member providing the training 
was able to order the naloxone kit under 
the supervising prescriber’s name, thereby 
allowing the provision of the naloxone 
autoinjector to the patient at the time of 
training.
Method of Evaluation
We tabulated the number of patients 
identified via the STORM tool as high-
risk users at baseline and subsequently 
tracked the number of patients prescribed 
naloxone on a monthly basis. These data 
were provided to frontline staff as well as 
the ambulatory clinic leadership in the 
form of e-mail and in verbal huddle com-
munication. We additionally tracked the 
type of provider (eg, physician, RN, LVN) 
who distributed each naloxone kit. Finally, 
we documented the patients who were not 
prescribed naloxone as well as the underly-
ing reason (eg, failure to contact, patient 
refusal of naloxone).
RESULTS
There were 67 patients identified as hav-
ing high-risk opioid use, and none of these 
patients had been prescribed naloxone at 
the beginning of the intervention (0%). 
At the end of the intervention period, 61 
patients (91%) had been provided with and 
trained in the use of naloxone (Figure 1). 
The naloxone was primarily distributed 
to patients by LVNs (42/61, 69%), with 
the remainder distributed by RNs (16/61, 
26%) and physicians (3/61, 5%).
Of the 6 patients (9%) who were not 
prescribed naloxone, 3 patients declined 
the medication/training for undisclosed 
reasons, 2 patients were no longer receiving 
their care at our clinic, and 1 could not be 
contacted by telephone or letter and had 
not yet returned to the clinic. 
DISCUSSION
Naloxone training and distribution 
has historically been implemented in a 
community-based expanded public health 
model, in which naloxone is distributed 
to those who use opioids as well as to po-
tential bystanders (defined as those who 
may be present for an overdose event but 
not personally experiencing such).12,13 
Although this model has shown efficacy, 
the reach and impact of naloxone train-
ing and distribution could be extended 
substantially by involving primary care 
clinics and clinicians. This general practice 
model of distribution is uncommon and 
little explored because of, in part, the in-
herent challenges of conducting naloxone 
training and distribution in the primary 
care setting. Barriers that have been cited 
include lack of practitioner time, lack of 
practitioner knowledge, lack of general-
ist ownership (ie, belief that specialists 
should manage substance-use disorder), 
and stigma surrounding opioid use.14,15
We describe an innovative, primary 
care-based quality improvement initiative 
that increased naloxone distribution and 
training to a veteran population at high

Naloxone Distribution and Training for Patients with High-Risk Opioid Use in a Veterans Affairs Community-Based Primary Care Clinic
risk of opioid-related adverse events. There 
were several unique features of this inter-
vention that addressed previously cited 
barriers and contributed to its success. The 
first of these barriers was practitioner time, 
which was addressed both in the patient 
identification and patient training process. 
This study demonstrated the feasibility of 
using electronic medical record tools to 
identify and prioritize patients at high risk 
of adverse events related to opioid use. We 
also demonstrated that a patient identifi-
cation and naloxone training process need 
not be championed by a physician but, 
rather, could be effectively implemented 
by nursing or pharmacy members of clinic 
teams after appropriate training. A previ-
ous qualitative study of general practitio-
ners demonstrated a significant portion 
that preferred a model of naloxone delivery 
that engages nonphysician members of the 
multidisciplinary team, as our study did.14
This intervention also addressed the 
perceived barrier of practitioner knowl-
edge. Our clinical team endorsed comfort 
with naloxone training, as measured by 
binary assessment of willingness to pro-
vide naloxone counseling, after a single 
30-minute, pharmacist-led session with 
supplemental online educational videos. 
Given the brevity of this clinician training, 
it is feasible to implement during routine 
all-clinic team meetings and does not 
require additional time away from clinic.
Finally, although there are substance 
use treatment services accessible at our 
Community-Based Outpatient Clinic, 
there was no involvement by mental health 
or substance use specialists. This demon-
strates the feasibility of primary care-based 
programming and addresses the historical 
lack of generalist ownership. 
Sustainability
The Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention now recommends that nalox-
one be prescribed to patients with a history 
of substance-use disorder, prior overdose, 
high-dose opioid prescriptions, and/or 
concurrent benzodiazepine prescription.16 
To adhere to this recommendation, clin-
ics must develop a process for prescribing 
naloxone to patients.
Although the workflow we have de-
scribed was effective in providing naloxone 
training to existing patients with opioid 
use, separate and sustainable processes 
were concurrently developed for patients 
who are newly prescribed opioids. To 
ensure the sustainability of naloxone 
prescribing, our VA medical center now 
embeds naloxone orders within opioid 
medication electronic order sets. Prac-
titioners are also prompted to prescribe 
naloxone and provide counseling when 
initiating opiate therapy of any kind and 
for any duration. This model is supported 
by a recent nonrandomized intervention 
in safety-net primary care clinics dem-
onstrating its feasibility and association 
with a 63% reduction in opioid-related 
Emergency Department visits at 1 year.17 
Limitations
Our project demonstrates the ability to 
engage patients in naloxone training but 
studied only the process measure of nal-
oxone kit distribution. Although we may 
extrapolate the benefit of this medication 
from other literature, outcome measures 
such as patient knowledge and skills 
with naloxone administration and the 
number of opioid-related adverse events, 
Emergency Department visits, and deaths 
among those administered a naloxone kit 
were not measured. The generalizability of 
our findings may also be limited because 
of our clinic’s concentration on margin-
ally housed veterans with high rates of 
comorbid substance use and mental health 
disorders and who have a close connection 
with their primary care home given the 
comprehensive services provided. Addi-
tionally, the STORM tool used to identify 
high-risk patients requires an electronic 
medical record and is validated for veterans 
but not for other patients.
CONCLUSION
It is feasible to distribute to and to 
educate high-risk patients on naloxone 
use in primary care clinics to reduce opi-
oid-related adverse events. When clinical 
pharmacists and nurses deliver patient 
naloxone counseling, it requires minimal 
physician time. Ultimately, this type of 
delivery model can increase the number 
of patients receiving naloxone who are 
not engaged in mental health or other 
specialty care. v

and 61 patients (91%) were prescribed naloxone at the end of the intervention in March 2016.

From the artist: “On an early spring evening, in a typical thermal inverse weather pattern in Portland, OR, the fog is 
rising, the sun is setting, and the sky is turning a pinkish hue. I set my camera on a tripod to try to shoot the snowy 
mountain beyond the tree line, when suddenly a flock of birds appeared and gave this tranquil scene a poetic mood.”

The Importance of Continual Learning  
in a Rapidly Changing Health Care Environment
Michael H Kanter, MD; Patrick T Courneya, MD 
Perm J 2018;22:18-071
E-pub: 04/25/2018  
https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-071
Changes in health care are rapid with increasing participation 
from nontraditional companies in technology, pharmacy, and 
others.1 Most recently, Chase, Berkshire Hathaway, and Amazon 
announced a joint health care initiative and the formation of an 
independent company to focus on technology solutions for simpli-
fied, high quality, and affordable health care.2 The announcement 
sent immediate ripples throughout the health care industry and be-
yond even though it included no material plans or concrete details. 
With the increase of available technology, the promise of new and 
nontraditional means to access care, and the general trend toward 
consumerism in health care,3 patients and purchasers are demanding 
more value—including higher-quality services, improved access, 
and lower costs. Moreover, as health care becomes more global 
through the advent of cloud computing and mass customization, 
there is growing demand for health equity and the mitigation of 
health disparities. Kaiser Permanente (KP) is already making great 
strides in this area and were recently recognized by the Center for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services as the first recipient of their new 
Health Equity Award.4 
New technology is rapidly being applied to health care, leading to 
great advancements in how we treat and prevent illness. Although 
this innovation has led to mostly favorable results, some significant 
problems have surfaced, such as alleged fraud,5 that require vigilance 
on the part of health care organizations. These lessons are not new. 
Looking back on examples like the harm arising from relaxed use 
of opioids and the dramatic change in prescribing that came as 
we learned about risks of postmenopausal estrogen use, we learn 
repeatedly the importance of sound evidence and continuous 
vigilance as new evidence comes to us through research. There is 
also increasing recognition that one of the most common causes of 
harm are diagnostic errors, which may affect more than 12 million 
patients per year.6 Improvement efforts are challenging because of 
difficulties in measuring the problem and the gap in time that often 
occurs between the initial error and its detection. However, KP 
has closed many of the systemic gaps that contribute to diagnostic 
errors through our SureNet programs.7,8 
There is also great demand to begin measuring outcomes that 
matter to patients and that go beyond process measures and a 
limited set of intermediate outcomes measures. Although the 
work is still in its infancy, KP is leading the way in this area with 
demonstrated reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.9
Because KP has created effective solutions to many national 
challenges that affect the health care industry at large, we feel it is 
important to publish the results of our learning and improvement 
efforts in hopes of supporting health care improvement outside of 
our system. For the 15th year, KP is convening its National Quality 
Conference and will again publish the abstracts of presentations at the 
meeting to help spread new quality initiatives throughout the nation. 
The abstracts cover each of the National Academy of Medicine’s 6 
aims or dimensions of quality (safe, timely, efficient, effective, equi-
table, and person-centered),10 which also form the framework for KP’s 
National Clinical Quality Strategy. We recognize that there are many 
health care quality conferences of high value offered by organizations 
such as the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, the National Pa-
tient Safety Foundation, and others. However, we believe that large 
health care organizations can and should participate in creating quality 
forums where practices are not only shared but also published.11 v

1. X Project: Getting Grounded—How Project Chamai Is Poised  
to Serve Emotional Wellness Needs of Kaiser Permanente Members 
Trina Histon, PhD; W Scott Heisler, RN, MBA; Herbert Ozer, LCSW; Paul Castaldo, LCSW 
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-071-01
Background: Project Chamai was launched in 2016 to apply the Xcelerating Learning 
and Spread (XLS) framework to develop new options for members that are convenient, 
timely, and affordable. Working in partnership with Kaiser Permanente (KP) Northwest and 
Southern California and our members, a minimally viable package to support member 
needs has been developed and is being tested in operations on kp.org. This includes 1) a 
landing page with emotional wellness content that can be personalized by the member; 2) 
workflows to enable therapists who work all along the care path to refer to these tools; 3) 
tools in an online personalized action plan (oPAP) that supports a member’s episode care; 
4) small-scale user testing of 3 to 5 online mobile applications to support emotional health. 
Methods: At KP it is estimated that 25% of people in Specialty Behaviorial Health have 
a Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score of 10 or less. Project Chamai is primarily 
for members who are experiencing subclinical symptoms of depression or anxiety that 
may include but are not limited to sleeplessness, emotional distress, difficulty engaging in 
social activities, feeling overwhelmed, and difficulty in coping with life transitions. Project 
Chamai can also be leveraged for members who are in ongoing therapy and Depression 
Care Management, because cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and other evidence-based 
tools can act as an adjunct to care. 
Results: Key insights from the “Understand” phase have been used to inform design 
principles that in turn led to the development of low- to medium-fidelity prototypes of 
solutions (new landing page on kp.org, ability to personalize content, tool curation, access 
to premium applications (CBT, etc) to support members’ emotional needs. Action plans 
for therapists are also being developed for use in oPAP as part of workflow optimization 
for mental health and wellness needs. Metrics that matter are part of the human- centered 
design process and include PHQ-9, and regional tools like Tridiuum (Polaris Health Di-
rections, Wayne, PA) and a collaborative outcomes resource network (ACORN, Salt Lake 
City, UT) to track clinical outcomes in addition to preference and Web-based metrics to 
track user experience. Results from the small-scale user testing of mobile applications and 
online programs will also be shared.
Discussion: XLS provides a robust framework to show a cohesive process to chart the 
progress of national projects accountability for outcomes at each stage. Using human-
centered design ensures that KP is truly delivering person-centered care by working with 
providers and members to build the solution.

few as 25% of people with depression receive effective treatment. 
Most depression is detected in primary care, yet rates of appropriate 
treatment for patients with a diagnosis remain low. Depression Care 
Management (DCM) consists of a dedicated team that specializes in 
the treatment of depression in a primary care setting.
Methods: Population: Adult members age 18 years and older with 
a depression diagnosis (Major Depression Diagnosis or dysthymia), 
Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score 5-19, with or without 
a medication. Patients with a PHQ-9 score > 20 can be seen by DCM 
if a specialist believes s/he can treat the patient safely and effectively. 
Intervention: Behavioral activation, mindfulness, problem-solving 
treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy, medication treatment, ad-
herence, and management. Outcome measures: Remission and 
improvement rates for patients enrolled and in treatment with DCM 
for a minimum of 3 months with an enrollment PHQ-9 score > 10. 
Rates are based on changes in PHQ-9 scores.
Results: 1) Increased PHQ-9 rates in Primary Care; 2) increased 
referral rates to Depression Care Management; 3) treatment outcome 
targets exceeded: 59% improvement in symptoms (goal 50%) and 
44% remission of symptoms (goal 25%).
Discussion: 1) DCM to identify expansion plans for the upcoming 
year. Plans range from expansion to specialty departments (Obstetrics, 
Oncology) to further involvement and integration with existing popu-
lation care management programs such as diabetes; 2) auto-referral 
pilot to assist with streamlining the process of patients being referred 
to DCM; 3) develop directional strategy for outreach and monitor 
penetration rates of DCM program to determine if the right people 
are getting the right treatment; 4) provide Depression Emmi (Wolters-
Kluwer, Chicago, IL) for newly diagnosed patients on online personal 
action plan; 5) booster sessions and trainings for grief, subsyndromal 
situational depression, substance use/misuse; 6) Southern California 
Region participation in Project Chamai.

3. Moving Upstream: Three Regions’ Approaches  
for Addressing Social Determinants and Needs  
to Improve Health Outcomes 
Nicole Friedman, MS; Irene Alvarez-Zamzow, MPH; Adam Sharp, MD, MS; 
Ranu Pandey, MHA
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-071-03
Background: Social and economic circumstances are known to 
have a powerful impact on health outcomes and health care use. Ad-
dressing these circumstances is crucial for improving health equity and 
fulfilling the 
Triple Aim. 
There is growing recognition of the importance 
of health care organizations assessing and addressing these issues in 
collaboration with community organizations. The 2014 Institute of 
Medicine report recommended inclusion of social and behavioral 
domains in electronic health records, and several Kaiser Permanente 
(KP) programs wanted to incorporate social needs assessment (SNA) 
into their health assessments and protocols.
Methods: Population: SNA programs servicing 3 target populations: 
KP Southern California (KPSC) Health Leads (HL) predicted high users 
(top 1%); KP Northern California (KPNC) Medicaid Managed Care 
(MMC) members; KP Northwest (KPNW) navigator program handling 
referrals from across the care continuum. Intervention: Social needs 
screening by various modes (phone, in-person, kp.org) using a validated 
SNA questionnaire. Members with identified needs referred or connect-
ed with appropriate KP or community resources. Outcome measures: 
Phase 1: Number of members screened; social needs prevalence; count 
and percentage of members identifying one or more needs. For KPSC 
HL pilot, utilization and costs for intervention and comparison groups. 
Phase 2: successful referrals, health outcomes, and utilization impact. 
Results: KPNW Navigator Program: 10,000 patients screened. More 
than 42,000 social v-codes in the medical record and more than 
12,000 community resource referrals. Additionally, 20% of these refer-
rals were either fully or partially satisfied. KPSC HL pilot (case control): 
High prevalence of social needs for top 1%; large voltage drops in 
communication from screen to connection; telephone intervention 
appears similar, may be more efficient; no overall short-term impact 
on costs and/or utilization except for very-low-income members 
(Medicaid, Dual Eligibles). KPNC MMC program: KP SNA tool (YCLS 
or Your Current Life Situation) integrated into onboarding assessment 
tool which will be used for all KPNC MMC members in 2018.
Discussion: KP has made great progress in member SNA. The Care 
Management Institute, with regional partners, developed an SNA 
questionnaire and item bank that all programs are being encour-
aged to use to enable cross-program comparisons and pooling of 
SNA data. SNA tools are integrated into KP HealthConnect. Most KP 
Regions have or are planning targeted SNA programs, and the Care 
Management Institute is facilitating sharing of learnings and best 
practices across programs/Regions. Questions remain about highest 
priority populations for SNA, staffing requirements, assessment/referral 
protocols, documentation and tracking of referrals, how to address 
needs (eg, referral vs active linkage), and how to identify and work 
with community resources.

4. The Community Action Poverty Simulation:  
A Powerful, Interactive Experience, Moving People  
to Make a Difference
Anna Khachikyan
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-071-04
Background: The Community Action Poverty Simulation promotes 
greater understanding of poverty in breaking down stereotypes and 
allowing participants to experience poverty and to step into the real-
life situations of others. During the simulation, participants role-play 
the lives of low-income families, from single parents trying to care for 
their children to senior citizens trying to maintain their self-sufficiency 
on Social Security. The simulation opens your eyes to poverty and 
barriers to health care access. 
Methods: According to the US Census, 14.3% of all Californians 
are at poverty level, which is a household income of $63,783.
Results: One out of every 4 children in California lives below the 
federal poverty line. Child poverty rates among Latinos and African 
Americans are much higher (Latino: 30% poverty rate; African Ameri-
can: 31% poverty rate) than for whites (10% poverty rate) and Asians 
(12% poverty rate). More than 90% of children living in poverty have 
been born in the US. Children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds 
have poorer health outcomes.

Discussion: The Community Action Poverty Simulation is a power-
ful, interactive experience designed to help participants understand 
what a typical low-income family goes through in just trying to survive 
from month to month. A goal is to sensitize participants to the reali-
ties faced by low-income people and how those social and cultural 
contexts impact health care. A deeper understanding of barriers to 
health care access, the underlying causes of those barriers, as well 
as the impact of those barriers on people living in poverty and their 
experience of care, would help physicians and health care workers 
overcome these challenges and provide socially responsive care. Most 
importantly, it moves people to make a difference.

5. The E-SCOPE Initiative: A Strategic Approach  
to Identify and Accelerate Implementation of  
Evidence-Based Best Practices 
Joel Whittaker, MPH; Joanne Schottinger, MD; Michael H Kanter, MD; 
Marguerite Koster, LMFT, MA
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-071-05
Background: Proposed changes in front-line care often originate 
with clinician suggestions, but evaluating their merit is time-consum-
ing and expensive. Focused evidence reviews may yield inconclusive 
findings that do not allow clear-cut decisions, and pilot studies are 
vulnerable to poor design and less-than-rigorous evaluation. Dupli-
cating clinical trials is costly and inconsistent with our affordability 
mission. E-SCOPE offers an accelerated, more effective way to break 
the logjam of identifying and implementing evidence-based practices 
in the clinical care setting.
Methods: Problem: More than 36,000 clinical trials are published 
yearly, many demonstrating effectiveness of clinical interventions to 
improve the health of Kaiser Permanente (KP) members. Intervention: 
Combining proactive identification of high-quality evidence with 
stakeholder engagement, implementation support, and monitoring 
to accelerate delivery of evidence-based best practices. Comparison: 
Care improvement initiatives driven by expensive, time-consuming 
evaluation of anecdotal suggestions; focused evidence reviews with 
inconclusive results and no clear-cut decisions; poorly designed and 
evaluated pilot studies; duplicating costly clinical trials inconsistent with 
the KP affordability mission. Outcome: Timely, effective, and efficient 
identification and implementation of evidence-based best practices.
Results: Between 2014 and 2017, the E-SCOPE Initiative proactively 
identified and accelerated the launch of 17 evidence-based best prac-
tices to improve the effectiveness, safety, timeliness, and/or efficiency 
of care. The date from study publication to date of deployment for all 
E-SCOPE interventions ranged from 4 to 36 months, a reduction from 
the 17-year average implementation time documented in published 
literature (http://bit.ly/1voeaac). 
Discussion: The E-SCOPE process can successfully identify and 
implement beneficial evidence-based practices; minimize reliance 
on costly, time-consuming, and less-than-rigorous pilot studies; and 
reduce the time gap between publication and delivery of important 
patient care interventions supported by high-quality published 
evidence. The Southern California region is developing knowledge 
management resources to share the identified evidence-based best 
practices and implementation strategies with other KP regions, and 
will seek feedback from workshop attendees on how best to provide 
E-SCOPE resources to meet existing clinical priorities, delivery system 
structures, and resources in other regions.

6. Continuing Care Quality Management: Right Care, Right 
Time, Right Place Applied to Skilled Nursing Facility Care 
Peter Khang, MD; Jennifer Cortez; Christine Jordan; Artem Aghourian
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-071-06
Background: The postacute care marketplace is segmented with 
high degrees of variability among skilled nursing facility (SNF) 
leadership, care quality, and outcomes. Appropriate and adequate 
governance of the care provided and oversight of our members in 
SNF ensure the care they receive is consistent with what they received 
in the hospital.
Methods: Population: Improving the quality outcomes and utiliza-
tion of skilled nursing care for members (most often age 65 years and 
older). Intervention: Implement the Continuing Care Quality Manage-
ment (CCQM) model. Comparison: Compare results with historical 
outcomes and utilization. Outcome Measures: SNF patient day rate 
(PDR), SNF discharge rate, length of stay, and readmissions.
Results: The primary metric for success has been the SNF PDR—
measuring the number of skilled days per 1000 members. Between 
2015 and 2017, we saw the SNF PDR drop by nearly 33%. SNF PDR 
is the product of volume of SNF admissions and the length of stay. We 
have seen our SNF admission volumes decrease as CCQM emphasizes 
appropriateness of SNF placement, and CCQM-Inpatient Quality 
Management (IQM) teams work together to send patients home with 
adequate resources. 
The average length of stay remained constant, and 
the SNF Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) 
30-day readmission observed/expected ratio has been relatively stable, 
despite a 12% increase in the expected rate since 2016.
Discussion: The CCQM model translates Care Without Delay 
(CWD) to the continuum. It enhances the quality, timeliness and 
appropriateness of care for members, working relationships (internal 
and external), and business outcomes. Successful implementation 
of the model requires engagement of local and regional executive 
leadership, with a strong oversight component. Interdependent 
collaboration between IQM/CWD and CCQM is critical to making 
significant progress, as introducing the model will be the start of a 
culture change for both hospitalists and SNF specialists.

patients underwent thyroid procedures by low-volume (< 10 cases per 
year) surgeons, who had significantly higher rates of complications 
and 30-day readmissions—and who performed many fewer surger-
ies on an outpatient basis than higher-volume surgeons: 3% vs. 13% 
for total thyroidectomies and 29% vs. 46% for hemithyroidectomies. 
When appropriate, outpatient surgery is both more efficient and 
preferred by many patients.
Methods: Population: Patients with thyroid nodules or primary 
hyperparathyroidism being considered for surgery. Intervention: A 
multidisciplinary group (Head and Neck Surgery, General Surgery, 
Endocrinology, Medical Imaging, and Pathology) developed workflows 
identifying patient management steps, responsible providers, and key 
metrics. Group members became specialty champions. Published 
analyses of Kaiser Permanente data demonstrated the need for change. 
Lower volume surgeons could opt out of performing procedures or 
increase case volumes. A patient education pamphlet was created to 
support outpatient procedures. Surgeon-level quarterly reports track 
metrics. Comparison: 2008-2013. Outcome measures: Proportions 
of low-volume surgeons performing thyroid/parathyroid surgery and 
outpatient procedures and complication rates.
Results: In 2014-2017, the proportion of low-volume surgeons 
(< 10 cases/y) performing thyroid surgery decreased from 56% to 34%, 
the proportion of total thyroidectomies performed by low-volume 
surgeons decreased from 12% to 6%, and the proportion of same-day 
outpatient procedures increased from 42% to 73%. Among patients 
undergoing total thyroidectomy, the rate of 30-day all-cause readmis-
sions decreased from 3.5% in 2014 to 2.6% in 2015-2016. The rate 
of hematomas decreased from 0.3% in 2014 to 0.1% in 2015-2016, 
and the rate of transient hypocalcemia decreased from 7.8% in 2014 
to 6.2% in 2015-2016. In 2016, Lokahi funding supported spread to 
Colorado Permanente Medical Group (June), Northwest Permanente 
(August), Hawaii Permanente Medical Group (October), and Southern 
California Permanente Medical Group (December). Data on inter-
regional spread will also be presented. 
Discussion: Changing surgical practice to improve quality is pos-
sible with organization-specific data demonstrating the need for 
change, multidisciplinary champions building workflows that follow 
clinical practice guidelines and define provider responsibilities, 
development of provider-level reporting to assure quality outcomes 
and process adherence, and strong leadership support. Accelerating 
spread across Regions requires vertical and horizontal alignment of 
improvement priorities at national, regional, and local levels, execu-
tive support, streamlined access to analytic resources and expertise. 
Taking down the silos across the program to promote active collabo-
ration on an ongoing basis fosters clinical leaders who are adept at 
both evidence-based care and ongoing performance improvement.

8. Sepsis Showdown: A Unified, Interregional  
Approach to Sepsis Diagnosis and Treatment 
Cara Steinkeler, MD; Kenneth Robinson, MD
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-071-08
Background: Sepsis-related diagnoses (SEP) are life-threatening 
conditions caused by a dysregulated host response to infection or 
inflammation. Progression from signs of an inflammatory response 
to severe sepsis and septic shock requires prompt recognition and 
treatment to achieve the best clinical outcomes. Kaiser Permanente 
(KP) has been on a sustained journey to improve the care of patients 
with sepsis, with a goal of minimizing sepsis-related deaths and injury. 
In the past year, an interregional group has worked on additional 
resources, tools, and data to support these efforts.
Methods: In 2008, KP developed a performance-improvement pro-
gram to screen and provide effective treatments to patients identified as 
at-risk for sepsis. 
The program included education of sepsis champions, 
quality improvement staff, and operational leadership; development 
of sepsis scorecards with performance metrics; and ongoing sharing 
of quality improvement strategies and novel sepsis-related initiatives. 
Clinical strategies for evaluating and treating patients with less severe 
sepsis have continued. In 2017 an interregional Sepsis Workgroup was 
chartered by the KP National Quality Committee. Landscape analysis, 
definitions and guidelines, and analytics subgroups have completed 
work which will be shared during this session.
Results: During the past 6 years, increased awareness about sepsis 
has led to better identification of patients, resulting in an increased 
number of cases coded as having sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock. 
Mortality among patients admitted to Kaiser Foundation Hospitals with 
sepsis decreased from 12.0% to 8.1%, and for those patients with 
severe sepsis and septic shock, mortality over this same 6-year period 
has decreased from 20.2% to 13.1%. However, in Kaiser Foundation 
Hospitals, performance on SEP-1 (the bundle of sepsis and severe sepsis/
septic shock process measures) varies from 46% to 86%. Although KP 
outcomes such as inpatient mortality for patients with sepsis-related 
conditions are lower than those reported in the literature, there are op-
portunities to improve performance on sepsis bundles/process measures.
Discussion: Chart audits for the Centers for Medicare and Medic-
aid Services core measures for sepsis may not reflect performance, 
and thus the focus of this work has been on mortality. However, 
standardization of metrics across Regions and an automated means 
of obtaining data will provide better information on performance. 
Members of the interregional Sepsis Workgroup will share leading 
practices from across KP for early identification and risk stratification 
of patients with sepsis. Decision-support and documentation tools 
will be shared as will educational resources. A status update will be 
provided on analytic work in progress to improve automated abstrac-
tion of sepsis processes and outcome measures.

can lead to delays in care and adverse events, including unplanned 
admissions to the ICU and unexpected deaths. 
Methods: We describe the impact of implementing the advance 
alert monitor (AAM) early warning system using a remote quality 
nursing team in combination with standardized hospital rescue 
workflows (inclusive of supportive care to ensure patient prefer-
ences are respected) to reduce inpatient and 30-day postdischarge 
mortality in high-risk medical surgical patients who trigger the AAM 
alert. We compared mortality outcomes for cases (patients who 
triggered the AAM alert and received the AAM standard workflow 
intervention) with controls (patients who triggered the AAM alert 
and did not receive the AAM intervention) in hospitals in the same 
integrated network. 
Results: Our analysis describes the results from a difference-in-
differences evaluation comparing the preimplementation period 
to the postimplementation period at Kaiser Permanente Northern 
California hospitals with the AAM intervention relative to those with-
out it, adjusting for patient characteristics. Hospitals employing the 
intervention showed a statistically significant reduction in hospital 
and 30-day mortality for the patients who triggered the early warning 
system relative to a similar patient population at hospitals without 
the intervention. Several hospitals with the AAM intervention also 
demonstrated statistically significant decreases in length of stay.
Discussion: The AAM tool combined with review by a remote 
nursing team and standardized hospital workflows represents a 
systematic approach to reducing mortality for this at-risk population. 
Although AAM is the technology for proactive detection, it is only 
through workflow, culture change, and increased situational aware-
ness that we can make a difference in outcomes. We are spreading 
this program to all hospitals in Kaiser Permanente Northern Califor-
nia. AAM is a first step toward a vision where predictive analytics 
and remote monitoring ensure that acutely ill patients remain safe 
from harm, and their goals are incorporated into treatment decisions 
before adverse outcomes occur.

10. Using Lean Management to Drive  
Improvement at East Denver Medical Office 
Kristin Banks, DrPH, MPH; Tom Kazutomi, MA, NRP;  
Mehul Gandhi, MD, MBA; Hanah Polotsky, MD, MBOE
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-071-10
Background: The East Denver Medical Office Building (MOB) has 
historically scored below the regional average in Patient Satisfaction 
and People Pulse scores. In early 2017, East Denver leadership part-
nered with the Kaiser Permanente (KP) Colorado (KPCO) Regional 
Performance Improvement team to implement a Lean Management 
system to drive MOB improvement. The system entailed conducting 
a value stream analysis, implementing an MOB visual management 
system and leader standard work, and conducting several innovative 
pilot projects aimed at improving the member experience.
Methods: In early 2017 the East Denver MOB leadership team 
consisting of department managers, chiefs, and unit-based teams 
coleads participated in a value stream analysis to identify areas of 
improvement. The analysis consisted of three interactive half-day ses-
sions in which teams mapped the entire value stream of the member 
experience from MOB entry to exit. Several areas of opportunity were 
identified including 1) patient reception and welcoming process, 2) 
patient wayfinding and physical navigation, and 3) interdepartmental 
communication. The goal was to improve member satisfaction and 
create a “Speak-up” culture at East Denver MOB.
Results: Patient satisfaction scores improved significantly from 2016 
to 2017 on a number of scales including Overall Satisfaction (59% to 
68%), Likelihood to Recommend KP (46% to 52%) and Coordination 
of Care (43% to 49%). MOB People Pulse scores improved across all 
15 indexes from 2016 to 2017. The following themes achieved the 
greatest improvement: Line of Sight (9% improvement), Feedback 
and Development (8% improvement), and Engagement Index (5% 
improvement). In addition, East Denver MOB scored higher than the 
Colorado Region on all 15 indexes with the most pronounced being 
Integrity (7% higher than KPCO). 
Discussion: Implementing a Lean Management system in an MOB 
engages frontline teams in solving problems that can improve the 
member experience, patient outcomes, as well as employee engage-
ment and line of sight. It has the potential to improve efficiency, 
reduce waste, and enhance communication. However, this system 
will be most impactful when adopted by senior leadership and across 
the Region.

11. Spreading the News: Prevention of  
Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia is Possible
Cristine Lacerna, RN, MPH, CIC; David Witt, MD, FIDSA; Lawrence Block, 
Quality Oversight Support; Donna Patey, RN, CNS, WOCN
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-071-11
Background: A mortality review of hospitalized patients undertaken 
in 2008 identified hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) as a significant 
contributor to disability and death in the Northern California Region. 
A subsequent review done in 2012 showed that patients with HAP 
had longer hospital lengths of stay (an average of two weeks), were 
more likely to be discharged to skilled nursing facilities instead of 
home, and were six times more likely to die in the hospital. There 
were significantly more patients with HAP than those with ventilator-
associated pneumonia (VAP). They were more likely to be recover-
ing from routine surgery, elderly, tube-fed, or sedated than patients 
without pneumonia.
Methods: From 2010 to 2011, the HAP Prevention bundle was 
tested in pilot sites across the Region. We deployed the bundle to 
all sites in 2013. Interventions included patient ambulation, upright 
posture for meals, oral antiseptics, regular incentive spirometry, and 
reducing the use of sedatives. Decision-support tools were developed, 
such as banners that alert nurses that a patient is a pneumonia or 
aspiration risk, as well as a pneumonia provider order set. Reports 
on performance in the prevention measures were distributed regu-
larly. Collaboration with perioperative teams allowed the inclusion 
of incentive spirometers in the scheduling kit for surgical patients. 
HAP was the outcome and confirmed by a natural language extrac-
tion algorithm from the radiology result identified as a new opacity, 
sustained for 24 hours in a chest x-ray obtained 48 hours after hospital 
admission. Process measures include ambulation rate, compliance 
with oral chlorhexidine, and benzodiazepine usage.

Results: In 2017, we reduced our HAP by more than 60% from a 
rate of 7.1 per 1000 admissions to 2.3 per 1000 admissions. Since 
the implementation, an estimated 308 deaths were prevented and 
22,944 patient days saved.
Discussion: HAP was the leading cause of avoidable mortality in 
the Northern California Region. The reduction was substantial and ad-
dressed a risk lacking clinical practice guidelines and having a limited 
literature to base prevention practices on. This program fits perfectly 
with the Kaiser Permanente’s mission to “provide high-quality, afford-
able health care services and to improve the health of our members.” 
Preventing a hospital-acquired infection, such as pneumonia, dem-
onstrates our commitment to high-quality care. Health care is made 
more affordable by preventing complications and associated increased 
lengths of stay. This project aligns with the organization’s mission on 
affordability by decreasing significant patient morbidity and mortality.

12. Same-Day Bilateral Cataract Surgery: Providing  
More Value to Members and to Kaiser Permanente 
Robin Cisneros; Neal Shorstein, MD; Alan Moreno
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-071-12
Background: Same-day bilateral cataract surgery (SDBCS) is 
patient-centered, translates evidence to practice, and improves value 
to members and Kaiser Permanente (KP). 
Value includes safety, health 
outcomes, quality, access, cost, convenience, or satisfaction. This 
project demonstrates results for patients undergoing cataract surgery 
and benefits from facilitating interregional clinical collaboration 
and interentity analysis. Work products include clinical and busi-
ness cases that ease implementation burden and optimize SDBCS. 
Southern California Permanente Medical Group (SCPMG) Chiefs of 
Ophthalmology and Interregional Ophthalmology Practice Leaders 
established a 2018 goal to increase SDBCS. 
Methods: Population: Approximately 90,000 members/y have 
cataract surgery. Intervention: The common cataract surgery in the 
US is performed on each eye, on separate days (delayed, sequential 
bilateral). Comparison: SDBCS is rare in the US because of Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services reimbursement and fear of rare, bi-
lateral complications. Worldwide rates of Same Day Bilateral Cataract 
Surgery (SDBCS) are rising. In 2015, KP’s SDBCS regional rates varied 
from 0.3% (SCPMG) to 43.1% (Colorado Permanente Medical Group). 
Outcome measures: Refractive error, best-corrected visual acuity, and 
endophthalmitis. Evidence, including a large, published KP study, 
shows that SDBCS is safe and effective for appropriate patients and 
that risk of bilateral endophthalmitis is not supported in the literature. 
Results: During the course of this 1-year project, cataract surgeons 
studied the evidence and compared available tools, process flows, and 
member and provider education. The Interregional New Technologies 
Committee reviewed the published evidence on health outcomes. 
Members who had both procedures were interviewed about their 
experiences. Decision Support analyzed surgery, visit, operative time, 
and pre- and postoperative times. Finance facilitated monthly meet-
ings, documented work, and created deliverables such as the business 
and clinical cases. Though complete datasets are not yet available for 
2017, SDBCS rates continue to increase whereas endophthalmitis rates 
hold steady, as shown in the Northern California study. Conservative 
estimates of time savings from the member perspective because of 
SDBCS are approximately 3 hours, including visits, and 90 minutes 
of preoperative and postoperative time.
Discussion: Start with sound evidence of increased value to pa-
tients. 
Value was defined as what patients feel or care about. Member 
interviews demonstrated SDBCS added meaningful conveniences 
and savings; physicians not yet offering SDBCS listened. Patients’ 
opinions and internal and external outcome data were packaged with 
implementation tools to reduce barriers to change. Clinicians received 
needed guidance from similarly motivated, interregional colleagues. 
The Health and Value Creation Initiative (HAVC)-accessed data, ral-
lied administrative resources, facilitated monthly discussions, and 
provided business tools for physicians to work with their operational 
leaders. Regional work continues to translate this work into practice, 
monitor outcomes and utilization, and measure member satisfaction.

13. The Impact of Improving Access to Primary Care 
David Glass, PhD; Michael H Kanter, MD; Paul Minardi, MD
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-071-13
Background: There is a large body of literature that posits that many 
problems in the US health care system would be greatly ameliorated if 
primary care were more readily available to patients. However, there 
is little evidence about how quickly and how much utilization would 
shift and costs change if ready access to primary care were provided. 
This study fills that gap. It also offers some sobering lessons about 
challenges that may be encountered.
Methods: This study examines patterns of utilization and costs of 
employees and dependents at a large employer across an eight-year 
period, both before (2007-2009) and after (2010-2014) the imple-
mentation of a worksite medical office in 2010. The worksite office 
offered convenient primary care services with no travel from work 
(for employees), essentially guaranteed same-day access, and had 
no copay. Trends in all visit rates and costs were compared for the 
intervention group at the employer with a control group of Kaiser 
Permanente members who lived in the same area. 
Results: The worksite medical office intervention group had an 
increase in primary care visits relative to the control group (+43% vs 
+4%, p < 0.001). This was accompanied by a reduction in urgent care 
visits by the intervention group compared with the control group (-43% 
vs -5%, p < 0.001). There were no statistically significant differences 
in the other types of visits, and the total visit costs for the intervention 
group increased 5.7% vs 2.7% for the control group (p = 0.008). A 
subgroup analysis of the intervention group (comparing dependents to 
employees) found that the dependents achieved a reduction in costs 
of 2.7% (p < 0.001) across the study period. 
Discussion: Worksite medical offices offer an avenue for providing 
highly convenient primary care to employees and dependents of large 
employers. The potential for long-term reduction in utilization and 
costs with better access to primary care is significant, but not easily 
nor automatically achieved. Four years after the opening of a worksite 
medical office, we found members did rapidly and strongly shift to-
wards greater use of primary care. However, the path to cost savings 
was uneven. There is a large opportunity to further test this approach 
as 78% of large employers do not have a worksite medical office.

14. Spreading and Scaling Kaiser Permanente’s  
Primary Care Plus: An Interdisciplinary, Person-Centered 
Primary Care Model 
Tracy Ellen Lippard, MD; Sara Armijo; Amy Wolf, MD; Linda Donner, MHA
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-071-14
Background: Kaiser Permanente (KP) is committed to developing 
and implementing a systematic, crossregional plan to design, test, and 
scale programs addressing patients with complex health and social 
needs. The positive impact of Primary Care Plus (PC+) in KP Colorado 
(KPCO) resulted in a desire to further learn about person-centered 
primary care team models across KP. In early 2017, KP launched 
a direct replication of the PC+ model in KP Southern California’s 
(KPSC’s) Woodland Hills Medical Center to understand the impact 
and scalability of PC+. 
Methods: KPCO’s PC+ followed strict eligibility criteria to capture 
high-need, persistently high-cost members older than age 65 years 
(or age 18-64 years who are enrolled in Medicare). The evaluation 
design was a prospective matched control study assessing cost and 
utilization of members from a single clinic at 12 months of enroll-
ment. KPSC Woodland Hills’ PC+ adheres to the same eligibility 
criteria, but the evaluation is a randomized controlled study design 
using an intention-to-treat approach. The evaluation will assess costs, 
utilization, and quality of life. All primary outcomes measures will be 
measured at 12 and 24 months from baseline. 
Results: Most recent cohort study findings include statistically 
significant benefit in mean total health care costs at 12 months for 
PC+ members vs matched controls; cost savings in inpatient, Emer-
gency Department, skilled nursing facility, and pharmacy expenditure 
buckets; and PC+ members were more likely to have been screened 
for depression and anxiety. In addition, the early assessment evalu-
ation reported high satisfaction among practitioners, staff, members, 
and caregivers.
Discussion: As PC+ spread within KPCO and into KPSC, maintain-
ing adherence to the patient population, core model components, and 
study design is critical in studying the long-term Triple Aim results 
of this complex care model. Documentation of PC+ protocols in an 
implementation guide played a critical role in the ability to spread the 
intervention to additional medical offices at KPCO and to a replication 
at Woodland Hills in KPSC. In 2017, Woodland Hills began replicat-
ing PC+, with consultative guidance from the KPCO PC+ leadership 
team; this allows for crossregional transfer and further study of this 
complex care model. Beginning in May 2018, PC+ will also be tested 
at the Los Angeles Medical Center in KPSC.

15. Imaging to Treatment: Leveraging Technology to 
Redesign Care for the Pulmonary Nodule Pathway
Ashish Patel, MD; Daniel Navarro, MD; Michael Rizzo, MD;  
Steven Levine, MD; Todd Osinski, MD
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-071-15
Background: A 68-year-old woman came to Kaiser Permanente 
(KP) Oakland Emergency Department in 2006 for symptoms of bowel 
obstruction. Her hospital stay included a chest x-ray that showed an 
incidental lung nodule suspicious for cancer. She was treated for bowel 
obstruction, recovered, and went home. She returned 6 months later 
with shortness of breath and normal bowel function. Repeat chest 
x-ray showed a large mass consistent with advanced lung cancer. 
Methods: A pilot study was started at KP Oakland in 2006 to see 
how we can improve our care for following-up abnormal lung nod-
ules. All radiologists in the department were asked to flag any study 
that was suspicious of cancer. A medical assistant in the department 
kept the list and followed-up each patient to ensure the finding was 
addressed. Once the pilot demonstrated clinical need and patient 
benefit, the project was expanded to address the suspicious findings 
within 48 hours and support the primary care physician to expedite 
further work-up and treatment.
Results: Pilot: 650 patients (14/wk) were flagged with suspicious 
findings, of which 151 had cancer. Forty-eight patients (7%) were 
noted to have no intervention at 3 weeks, at which time the project 
intervened to ensure care. Expansion: 470 patients were followed. Of 
the 470 patients, 42 had cancer. The time from initial study, comple-
tion of the work-up, and seeing the treatment specialist was reduced 
from 40 days to 18 days. 
Discussion: An effective program to follow incidental lung lesions 
was designed, tested, piloted, and spread to the entire KP Northern 
California Region by 2018. Our integrated technology tools allow 
radiologists to flag the study and the multidisciplinary care team mem-
bers to take actionable steps in KP HealthConnect. Four centralized 
multidisciplinary teams (with pulmonologists, radiologists, thoracic 
surgeons, oncologists, and care coordinators) provide guidance to 
the primary care physician, on the basis of Comprehensive Cancer 
Network guidelines. The system provides a safety-net for new cancer 
diagnoses and expedites care for patients. The model is now being 
expanded for hepatobiliary, gastric, and adrenal cancer. This redesign 
in care, made possible by technology, will help us improve care for 
many more patients to come.

16. Bringing Hospital Care into the Home:  
Designing for Spread of AMCAH and SY@H 
Bruce Cohn, MD; David Wong, MD; Zeth Ajemian, MA
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-071-16
Background: The combination of an aging population requiring 
greater health care and increasing cost pressure on patients, families, 
and the health care system mandates that high-value solutions to com-
mon health care services be developed. Safety, efficiency, efficacy, 
and patient satisfaction help define high-value solutions to health care 
problems. Integrated health care systems need to exploit their unique 
assets to aggressively explore new models of high quality care. These 
programs are part of an ongoing trend to appropriately relocate care 
outside of the hospital setting.
Methods: The Advanced Medical Care at Home (AMCAH) program 
at Riverside Medical Center enrolls adult Kaiser Permanente (KP) 
members meeting InterQual criteria for hospital admission who pres-

acute hospitalization for the following diagnoses: Congestive heart 
failure, cellulitis, diverticulitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
pneumonia, and pyelonephritis. Key elements of the program include 
physician and nursing care, medication management, laboratory 
tests, member education, caregiver education, home safety assess-
ment, and phone access to clinical support. The See You @ Home 
(SY@H) Program at Roseville Medical Center enrolls patients who 
either: 1) present to the Emergency Department; 2) are identified in 
the hospital; or 3) are identified as having increased risk for acute 
hospitalization and can receive appropriate interventions at home, 
in lieu of hospital admission or continued hospitalization. Patients 
receive daily physician interventions from hospital-based physicians 
that include home visits, administration of parenteral medications, 
and appropriate laboratory monitoring. Physicians are available to 
patients and families by direct telephone access 24/7. Home health 
nurses are used to provide care when appropriate. Following resolu-
tion and stabilization of the acute medical illness, care is transferred 
to typical outpatient practitioners. A case control matching analysis 
was used to evaluate program outcomes. 
Results: AMCAH and SY@H have demonstrated excellent clinical 
outcomes, safe and effective medical care at home, prevention of 
decondition and reduced mobility, low programwide readmission 
rates, and the prevention of hospital-acquired conditions. Satisfac-
tion results are positive in all aspects of care with patients once in the 
program requesting admission to AMCAH or SY@H vs hospitalization. 
AMCAH, on the basis of regional financial analysis, has shown the 
program is cost favorable compared with traditional hospital care for 
7 and 30 days postepisode of care. SY@H has demonstrated utiliza-
tion outcomes supporting expansion of this alternative care model. 
Enrolled patients were compared to nonenrolled patients based on 
diagnosis, gender, age, comorbidity (Comorbidity Point Score, v 2), 
and measures of acute physiologic derangement (Laboratory Acute 
Physiology Score, v2). 
Discussion: AMCAH and SY@H deliver the right care, at the right 
place, at the right time. These innovative models transform the way KP 
cares for patients and adds value by focusing on patient-centered care. 
Eligible members are receiving time-limited acute care services in the 
comfort of their own homes as an alternative to hospital admission 
and inpatient care. KP Southern California seeks to spread and scale 
the AMCAH program from Riverside Medical Center, starting with 
Panorama City Medical Center and working with additional demon-
stration sites to establish operating practices that support regional and 
national spread. KP Northern California has expanded SY@H to the 
Sacramento Medical Center as a first step toward spread.

17. National Total Joint Replacement Initiative: A Case 
Study for Accelerated Systemwide Spread and Learning 
Jeff Convissar, MD; Kate Koplan, MD; Ronald Navarro, MD;  
Violeta Rabrenovich, MHA, CHIE
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-071-17
Background: National Total Joint Replacement Initiative’s (NTJRI’s) 
approach balances safety, person centerness, effectiveness, efficiency, 
equity, and timeliness. NTJRI provides an opportunity for clinically 
appropriate patients to recover at home after surgery and to reduce 
any unnecessary time hospitalized in a facility, which can cut down 
on complications such as surgical infection and can allow patients 
to heal in a comfortable, safe environment by planning in advance 
for the support they will need after surgery. In addition, NTJRI pro-
vides a framework and a validated method to accelerate adoption of 
evidence-based practices and service improvement.
Methods: As the NTJRI work transitioned into a second year, NTJRI 
stakeholders recognized the importance of having a reliable method-
ology that evaluates performance on the basis of all aspects of Kaiser 
Permanente’s (KP’s) National Quality Strategy. The group developed 
an appropriate set of measures. Reports are issued quarterly, three 
months after the close of each quarter. Data for the previous three 
quarters are automatically updated and included in the charts in each 
report. In addition, we developed a process to set national and local 
targets, established a programwide directional target for each length 
of stay, and developed thresholds for monitoring of balancing mea-
sures and identified an appropriate set of benchmarks to compare our 
performance. The second-year regional gap analysis was conducted, 
demonstrating significant progress in the Regions. 
Results: Each Region established its own length of stay targets that 
collectively combine to an overall KP programwide target of 22% 
0-day and 57% 1-day surgeries. The NTJRI Quarter 3 2017 Report 
demonstrates an average length of stay (average of number of days 
past midnight between admission and discharge) decline during the 
past 12 months to 1.19, compared with 1.64 in Quarter 3 2016. At 
the national and local levels, quality and operational leaders monitor 
balancing measures to ensure safe and effective clinical care. Bench-
marks have been set by the Total Joint Registry surgeon champions for 
return to Emergency Department and Urgent Care (ED/UC) within 7 
days and hospital readmissions within 30 days. The benchmark for 
readmissions within 30 days is 3%. 
The benchmark for return to ED/UC 
within 7 days is 8%. According to NTJRI Quarter 3 2017 Report, our 
readmissions (2.7%) and return to ED/UC (7.1%) have remained stable. 
Discussion: The learnings from NTJRI and the process can be 
transferred to other national and interregional initiatives. Collabora-
tive efforts that support successful and reliable implementation of 
evidence-based practices require strong leadership and support of 
technical and operational leaders. Strategic alignment of national 
and regional improvement efforts enables accelerated improvements 
across the program. Strategically gathered and used patient input 
results in care delivery pathways that are embraced both by clini-
cians and patients.

Catherine Winarsky, MPH, BSc (Pharm)
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-071-18
Background: Care Without Delay (CWD) is a model of care devel-
oped by Kaiser Permanente (KP) Southern California (KPSC) in Baldwin 
Park, which quickly produced remarkable outcomes. By aligning 
delivery system processes, CWD improves care timeliness, removes 
system barriers to care, provides a great care experience, and produces 
cost savings in a true Triple Aim fashion. Because of Baldwin Park’s

outcomes, it was spread throughout KPSC and subsequently through 
KP Northern California (KPNC) with similar results. Now, it is being 
implemented in all Regions as KP’s operating model.
Methods: Problem: Many hospital admissions are preventable 
and frequently patients are not cared for at the right level of care. 
Untimely care and care delays can lead to longer length of stay, 
hospital-acquired infections, increased costs, and reduced patient 
satisfaction. KP strives to improve quality of care in a highly reliable 
fashion. Intervention: A care team addresses all patient (medical and 
nonmedical) needs in a timely manner. The focus is on doing today’s 
work today, long-term care planning, real-time peer review, escala-
tions, communication and collaboration, and 24/7 staffing with strong 
leadership and oversight. Comparison: Baseline data (patient day rate 
[PDR], average length of stay, readmission rate, etc) from the previous 
year. Outcome Measure: Reduced PDR and improved quality, safety, 
and experience for patients.
Results: Benefits realized from CWD implementation have included 
a decline in PDR from > 300 to ~ 220 in KPNC and KPSC, decreased 
hospital mortality and reduced variation in PDR across KPNC fa-
cilities, and a decline in avoidable hospital days and care costs. The 
foundation for these results lie in the close patient care coordinator 
(PCC) and hospitalist partnership focused on the patient, including 
daily multidisciplinary rounding with the physician, the PCC, a bed-
side nurse, and the patient or patient’s family, allowing immediate 
removal of barriers and escalation when necessary. Outcomes are a 
result of timely service availability at all hours, including weekends 
and after-hours (7-day hospitals), a focus on extended length of stay 
patients and reduced postacute placement barriers. In addition, CWD 
has received positive feedback from staff, physicians, and patients. 
Discussion: CWD is an operating model that improves the quality 
and affordability of care KP members receive. It is a hospital-based 
model, but it can be adapted for non-KP facilities/Regions and ser-
vices outside the inpatient setting. CWD provides a strong foundation 
on which to build other initiatives. Innovations for success include 
strong long view of care planning and application in other areas (eg, 
ambulatory care, skilled nursing facilities, behavioral health). Success 
factors for further spread include leveraging the Xcelerating Learning 
and Spread model as a common language for communication and to 
better understanding Regional status and needs.

19. Optimal ESRD Starts: Moving Upstream Chronic 
Kidney Disease to Prevent or Delay End-Stage Renal 
Disease with Predictive Analytics 
Sophie Taylor, RN; Alvina Sundang; Leonid Pravoverov, MD; Karen Ching, MD
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-071-19
Background: An Optimal End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Start is 
defined as starting dialysis with a mature access such as arteriovenous 
fistula or graft, peritoneal dialysis catheter, or kidney transplant. Inter-
ventions in the earlier phases of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the 
next frontier in quality management of this population. A methodology 
for screening patients for proteinuria and accurately staging their CKD 
has been developed by members of the Nephrology Inter-Regional 
Clinical Practice Group and Federation Analytics staff. Findings show 
that 32% of eligible patients were not screened for proteinuria or 
albuminuria, and 87% of eligible patients have ACE inhibitor (ACEI) 
or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) ordered. 
Methods: Members with progressive CKD stages 1-5 reaching 
ESRD. CKD stages defined using Kidney Disease Improving Global 
Outcomes Staging (stages glomerular filtration rate into nine groups 
and divides proteinuria stages into seven groups). CKD stages are 
assigned by requiring 2 outpatient serum creatinine tests > 90 days 
apart used to estimate glomerular filtration rate according to the 
CKD-epidemiology equation. To determine members’ final CKD 
stage, a forward-looking algorithm is run until the algorithm reaches 
the most recent eGFR. Then, all Kaiser Permanente (KP) members are 
grouped using a standardized method across KP into distinct CKD 
groups, and this data becomes the foundation for tracking 2 metrics: 
Proteinuria Screening in CKD1-4 members and ACEI/ARB Treatment 
in hypertensive CKD1-4 members. The outcome measure will be to 
evaluate ESRD incidence over time. 
Results: Of the 223,627 patients who met the criteria for screen-
ing of albuminuria/proteinuria, 32.38% did not receive screening. 
Of those meeting criteria for ACEI/ARB, 87.40% have ACEI or ARBs 
prescribed. Regional results for screening of albuminuria/proteinuria 
vary from 14% to 65%, and for ACEI or ARBs prescribed vary from 
78% to 88%. Across the program, the estimated number of patients 
currently requiring albuminuria/proteinuria testing is approximately 
72,000. The maximum for ACEI/ARB treatment is unknown but bar-
ring uncontrollable hyperkalemia, most nonallergic patients should 
be able to take one or the other. We believe 95% is attainable, and 
KP is currently at 87% nationally. Thus, there are about 4200 candi-
dates for therapy.
Discussion: As the work on Optimal ESRD Starts continues, valida-
tion of the North-West Prediction Model in three Regions (Georgia, 
Northern California, and Hawaii) determined that the model performs 
very well. Further stratification of proteinuria screening-eligible can-
didates is needed to identify the most urgent patients at risk and to 
address this cohort first. Next steps include establishing workflows to 
screen, stage, and manage CKD patients in each Region.

20. Committee for Improvement of Performance  
Through People: Strengthening Influence Over Work  
and Engagement in Primary Care Clinical Pharmacy 
Beverly Kroner, PharmD; Alex Block, PharmD
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-071-20
Background: Leaders in organizations often say people are their 
most important assets, yet actions may not always demonstrate this. 
Supervisors typically try to keep their barometer in the middle, with 
the organization at one end and the people at the other. In tough times, 
such as when the financial picture is not looking positive, people are 
often given less attention and may feel less valued. We wanted to 
move our barometer more towards people.
Methods: Problem: We say people are our number one priority, 
 66

but our actions may not always demonstrate this. Intervention: After 
a supervisory off-site meeting with the theme of people, supervisors 
invited 4 team members to work with them to ensure a renewed focus 
on people. Comparison: People Pulse results in 2017 increased in 16 
of 16 indices compared with 2016. Outcome Measures: The work 
unit index (most influential for supervisors) increased by 6 points 
to 95% and the engagement index increased by 11 points to 90%. 
The statement, “I have enough say in how I do my job” increased 
17 points to 86%. 
Results: Primary Care Clinical Pharmacy Services (PCCPS) includes 
38 clinical pharmacy specialists supporting patient care teams in 28 
ambulatory medical offices. Four team members and the supervisory 
team formed the Committee for Improvement of Performance through 
People (CIP2) in April 2016. CIP2 members worked directly with the 
PCCPS team and supervisory team to identify perceived problems 
and to develop possible solutions. CIP2 members sent a survey to 
the team in May 2016. Five major themes were identified from the 
survey results (Flexibility, Autonomy, Collaboration, Work Environ-
ment, and Career Support), and items were further stratified into 1 
of 4 quadrants: 1) easy, noncontroversial; 2) easy, controversial; 3) 
hard, noncontroversial; and 4) hard, controversial. CIP2 delegated 
responsibilities for individual items, commencing work with easy, 
noncontroversial items.
Discussion: The Colorado Region has faced significant challenges 
in providing affordable care to a growing population of shorter-term 
members with high-deductible coverage. A reaction has been to ask 
even more of care teams to improve performance. As an alternative 
reaction, the PCCPS supervisory team collaborated with a team of 
frontline staff on working smarter and removing barriers to allow the 
team to work even more efficiently while still delivering on quality, 
safety, and affordability initiatives. One limitation to expanding this 
concept is CIP2 members had the respect and credibility of the PCCPS 
team. Without this, they might not have been as successful.

21. Deprescribing: A Graduation in Medicine 
Christopher C Change, PharmD, BCGP, PMP; Lynn Deguzman, PharmD, 
BCGP; Maisha Draves, MD, MPH
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-071-21
Background: By 2050, the US Census Bureau projects that the 
US population of adults older than age 65 years will nearly double. 
Human aging results in physiologic changes, frailty, and added 
comorbidities that require multiple medications to treat age-related 
medical conditions. Accordingly, the issue of polypharmacy is in-
creasingly reported in the literature. With more medications, elderly 
patients tend to have complex medication regimens, often leading 
to nonadherence, adverse drug events, and a reduced quality of life.
Methods: In partnership with Kaiser Permanente (KP) Northern 
California Clinical Pharmacy, 
The Permanente Medical Group Quality, 
Primary Care, subject matter experts, the Institute for Healthcare Im-
provement, and the Commonwealth Fund, we designed a pharmacist-
led deprescribing program to reduce potentially unnecessary/unsafe 
medication use in the elderly. Targeted initiatives: Well-controlled 
diabetes and blood pressure, chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs, controlled triglycerides on fibrates, and glucose test strips. 
Additionally, internal and external partnerships were established 
to ensure effective dissemination of resources for the deprescribing 
movement. Although deprescribing exists in KP in siloed forms, we 
aim to address the big picture by establishing central deprescribing 
resources, sharing broadly, and supporting deprescribing conversa-
tions in all settings. 
Results: The project went from idea to regionwide operation in 4 
months. During the 15 months of operations since, the pharmacist-led 
deprescribing program has touched more than 5000 patient lives and 
decreased medication/self-testing burden for nearly 3000. Clinical and 
financial outcomes research is underway. An interim analysis showed 
95% of patients with diabetes maintained goals of hemoglobin A1c < 
7.5% (n ~ 500) and 97% of blood pressure patients maintained goals 
of systolic blood pressure < 140 (n ~ 40) at 90 days postdeprescribing. 
The Permanente Medical Group and KP Northern California Clinical 
Pharmacy worked together to establish partnerships on this topic of 
deprescribing and polypharmacy. The team also received a grant from 
the Institute for Healthcare Improvement and Commonwealth Fund 
to apply performance improvement principles to the pharmacist-led 
deprescribing programs. 
Discussion: A broad range of partnerships is crucial to creating a 
movement in health care: Nimble use of technology is vital. The core 
team created a central OneNote. Structured query language algorithms 
were quickly created and adjusted to identify potential patients to 
include in the program. Custom KP HealthConnect data elements 
were built. Tableau was used for automated dashboards. Performance 
improvement ensures monitoring toward goals. The team applied 
driver diagrams, process charts, Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles, run charts, 
Model for Understanding Success in Quality assessments, strengths, 
weaknesses, opportunities, and threats analysis, aim statements, and 
more. Research: The project is building the foundations of research 
for patients who have participated in the deprescribing program. 
Next steps are to spread the message of deprescribing systematically.

22. Pharmacy and Care Management Collaboration 
to Improve Health Outcomes through Medication 
Reconciliation Program Expansion 
Bryan Davis, PharmD
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-071-22
Background: Pharmacy and Care Management departments formed 
a collaboration to expand Kaiser Permanente Washington’s (KPWA’s) 
medication reconciliation program from approximately 4700 medica-
tion reconciliations per year to a target of more than 17,000 medica-
tion reconciliations per year because of a new Centers for Medicare 
and Medicaid Services 5-Star measure: Medication Reconciliation 
Postdischarge (MRP). Medication reconciliation has been shown to 
decrease adverse medication events and has demonstrated potential 
impact on hospital readmissions. Health and safety outcomes were 
followed for 6 months to evaluate the program’s expansion impact. 
Methods: Population: All KPWA Medicare patients. Intervention: 
KPWA expanded the medication reconciliation program to all Medi-
care patients as compared with the original program, which only 
served “high-risk” patients determined by an internal modified LACE 
(length of stay, admission, comorbidities, Emergency Department 
visits in last 6 months) risk stratification tool. Comparison: Baseline

measures from prior years. Outcome measures: Program impact 
will be measured by observing readmission data as it pertains to the 
Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) Plan All-
cause Readmission (PCR) measure described as an O/E ratio (observed/
expected readmission ratio). Two Tableau (Seattle, WA) dashboards 
were built to track the percentage of successful medication reconcili-
ations and to track trends in the O/E ratio that include analyses of 
patients who have received medication reconciliation. 
Results: Initial analysis suggests a correlation between increased 
successful medication reconciliations and decreased O/E ratio. Suc-
cessful medication reconciliation increased from a baseline average 
of about 35% of all Medicare patients to approximately 70% of all 
Medicare patients during a 3-month timespan. During this 3-month 
period, the overall O/E ratio decreased 0.15 for all Medicare patients 
who received medication reconciliation. Evaluating a specific popula-
tion that had not received postdischarge medication reconciliation in 
years prior (Medicare patients deemed as “moderate-risk” for read-
mission), an overall decrease of 0.56 was observed in the O/E ratio 
(0.44 decrease from year before); and an overall decrease of 0.03 was 
observed regardless of medication reconciliation, indicating minimal 
impact because of other process changes. 
Discussion: Several variables can have contributions when it comes 
to evaluating impact on readmissions; however, the timing of the 
program expansion and the decrease in O/E ratio postulates a direct 
impact. Readmission data will continue to be followed to confirm 
the observed trends. The collaboration between pharmacists, care 
management nurses, home health clinicians, and primary care provid-
ers has shown a positive impact on health outcomes and allows for 
multiple perspectives to identify problems that provides a more holistic 
and patient-centered focus. This program highlights how medication 
reconciliation can be successfully leveraged across multiple providers 
and should be considered across KP programs.

23. “There’s No Place Like Home”: Creating a Safe, 
Individualized, Transitional Care Pathway After a Skilled 
Nursing Facility Stay 
Yvonne Rice, PharmD; Hannah Austin, MBA; Preston Peterson, MD 
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-071-23
Background: Care transitions from skilled nursing facilities (SNF) to 
home is a known clinical quality gap for medication reconciliation and 
safe, coordinated follow-up care. Kaiser Permanente Northwest 2016 
baseline performance of Hospital 30-day All Cause Readmission Rate 
for this population is higher than expected at 21% and indicates an op-
portunity for improvement. The objective is to improve safe transitions 
of care from SNF, reduce avoidable hospital readmissions, and prevent 
serious medication discrepancies causing an adverse drug event.
Methods: The target population is patients from contracted SNFs in 
the East Service Area who discharge to home or to a homelike facility. 
The intervention is the execution of a SNF Transition Bundle, which 
includes risk stratification, a transition hotline number, standardized 
discharge summary, pharmacist medication reconciliation, a transition 
nurse (RN) follow-up call or mobile health partner home visit, and 
practitioner follow-up appointment within 7 days. The target popula-
tion was compared with patients discharged from contracted SNFs 
outside the East Service Area. The success measures are decreased 
30-day hospital readmission rate, decreased harmful medication 
discrepancies and/or errors, and improved care experience with 
safer transitions.
Results: Outcomes and performance at Friendship SNF (baseline 
through September 2017): Hospital 30-day readmission rate de-
creased from 22.6% to 17.3% after Transition Bundle elements were 
implemented from January to year end. Serious medication errors at 
discharge decreased from 42% to 5%. Medication Reconciliation 
Post-discharge (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 5-star) 
increased from 14% to 80% (rolling 12-month rate). East Service 
Area SNF Transition Bundle performance results from first 6 months 
(June-Nov): Pharmacist medication reconciliation for 91% of patients; 
follow-up contact (RN phone call or mobile health partner home visit) 
for 81% of patients; follow-up appointment within 7 days for 47% 
of high-risk patients.
Discussion: Medication issues are complex and confusing for pa-
tients after SNF transitions of care and require dedicated resources to 
optimize reconciliation in the home. Coordination of care is improved 
with transition RN calls including family education, assistance with 
follow-up appointment, transportation, financial assistance, coordina-
tion with multiple teams, and action on acute symptoms. Contracted 
SNFs can be influenced to support safer medication processes, dis-
charge processes, and patient education. Workflow improvement is 
needed to reduce duplication and rework, and build efficiency. The 
next step is to spread the SNF Transition Bundle model of care to all 
contracted SNFs in the Region.

24. Collaborative Protocols between Physicians  
and Pharmacy Groups to Facilitate Opioid Reduction  
in the Napa-Solano Service Area
Jeff Chen, PharmD; Diparshi Mukherjee, DO
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-071-24
Background: The opioid epidemic is responsible for 6 out of 10 drug 
overdose deaths and, since 1999, prescription drug deaths from oxy-
codone, hydrocodone, and methadone have more than quadrupled. 
Historically, the Napa-Solano Service Area had the highest usage of 
hydrocodone/acetaminophen combination opioid prescription count 
out of any other service area in Northern California. The opioid reduc-
tion committee, commenced in March of 2016, is meant to tackle the 
issue of opioid use with support from medicine and psychiatry and 
with collaboration from the pharmacy group.
Methods: Population: Napa-Solano’s high rate of opioid utiliza-
tion. Intervention: Physician education, academic detailing, peer-
comparison information, and opioid taper. Comparison: Northern 
California service areas outside of the Napa-Solano Service Area. 
Outcome measures: Total morphine milligram equivalents (MME) 
reduction, total opioid tablet reduction, total opioid/acetaminophen 
combination tablet reduction, total oxycontin tablet reduction, and 
total alprazolam tablet reduction.
Results: Quantitative findings: Total MME reduction; total opioid 
tablet reduction; total hydrocodone/acetaminophen combination 
tablet reduction; alprazolam (Xanax) reduction; oxycontin reduc-
tion; and trinity (any opioid + benzodiazepine + skeletal muscle

Discussion: Establishment of site champions as point persons to 
facilitate communication of new opioid initiatives is vital to the success 
of the opioid reduction program. Assembly of the Opioid Reduction 
Committee with support from Chiefs of Medicine, Emergency De-
partment, and Psychiatry is the key to obtaining buy-in. Pharmacy 
collection of opioid data and frontline escalation of appropriate 
prescriptions to providers fuel the momentum of opioid reduction 
initiatives. Intensification of current MME threshold to ≤ 50 MME.

25. Improving Performance on Medicare Stars Medication 
Adherence Measures through Predictive Analytics
Heather Qian, MBA; Lynn Deguzman, PharmD, BDGP; Scott Jacobs;  
Kevin Chiang, PharmD; Chris Chang, PharmD, BCGP, PMP
DOI: https://doi.org/0.7812/TPP/18-071-25
Background: Low medication adherence is associated with worse 
clinical and quality outcomes. Accordingly, Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services measures adherence to statin, blood pressure, and 
diabetes medications as part of its Medicare Part C and D Star Ratings. 
These 3 triple-weighted measures represent 11% of the Star Ratings 
portfolio. Annual changes and competitor improvements continue to 
raise the bar on performance required for 5 stars. 
Methods: Population: Actionable patient lists were created by 
Pharmacy Analytical Services starting in 2015 and delivered through 
the centralized Permanente Online Interactive Network Tool (POINT) 
Medication Adherence 
Tool (MAT) for all Regions. 
These lists identified 
patients for intervention by regional pharmacy teams and included a 
date for each patient by which time refills must be made or the patient 
will be below the 80% adherence goal (per Medicare 5-Star program 
threshold) at year end. Interventions: Aside from live telephone calls, 
interventions included automated reminder calls, interactive texting 
reminders, batch kp.org messages, and outpatient pharmacy clinical 
services (OPCS) consultation modules. To prioritize outreach under 
limited resources, a predictive risk score was introduced in Q3 2017 
to identify the highest-risk patients. 
Results: Adherence scores have improved since the 2015 incep-
tion of the medication adherence programs, which leveraged analytic 
reporting through the POINT/MAT tool. Pharmacist and support staff 
outreach improved refill rates compared with a control group (39% 
vs 16% within 7 days, 46% vs 29% within 14 days). Telephone calls 
are among the most effective interventions for medication adher-
ence. Across 7 Regions, the programs touched more than 160,000 
patients in 2016 and 200,000 in 2017. Predictive risk modeling was 
implemented in Q3 2017. Because of data availability constraints 
since year end, the impact of the model is still being assessed, with 
results anticipated in Q1 2018. Outreach data and refill outcomes 
were collected. Work and partnerships are ongoing to enhance the 
predictive models in an iterative process. 
Discussion: To improve quality outcomes while maintaining 5-Star 
ratings in medication adherence, pharmacy is building actionable 
analytics for adherence outreach and developing risk models for 
population management. 
This is made possible by internal partnerships 
within and between Regions, and with Program Office and data part-
ners. Choosing to build analytics in-house leads to a continued cycle 
of investigative learning, monitoring outcomes, and development of 
workflows. Setting up analytic plans to track and to evaluate new tools 
(eg, predictive models) before tool implementation is important for 
value capture. Work is underway across the Regions to evaluate and 
enhance the new predictive models, leading to a more efficient and 
effective programwide effort.

oped nations. 
These primarily unintended births suffer high rates of poor 
maternal and infant health outcomes. When financial, educational, and 
access barriers to contraception are removed, adolescents overwhelm-
ingly choose long-acting reversible contraception (LARC), the most 
effective, safest, and most cost-efficient option. The Kaiser Permanente 
(KP) Colorado (KPCO) initiative was uniquely designed to address edu-
cational and logistical barriers within the KP integrated health system, 
using existing infrastructure and focusing on training frontline pediatric 
providers, resulting in wider use of LARC among adolescents.
Methods: The cohort included all female adolescents age 13-18 
years cared for by KPCO pediatric, primary care, and women’s health 
clinicians between January 2013 and December 2016. The educa-
tional intervention included journal clubs, live interactive educational 
sessions, and in-service training of clinical staff. Primary care clinicians 
who received training on LARC were linked with a mentor gynecolo-
gist to provide further support. The process improvement interven-
tion included development of a LARC implementation toolkit in the 
electronic health record to assist with prescribing, documentation, 
consent, and procedural set up, as well as clinical library guidelines 
and patient education materials on contraceptive choice.
Results: The proportion of LARC placed by primary care clinicians 
increased from 5.8% in 2013 to 32.5% in 2016 (p < 0.001), with the 
overall rate of LARC placement increasing from 1.5/1000 members/
quarter to 4.8/1000 members/quarter. By the end of the intervention, 
61 primary care clinicians had LARC training (vs 8 at baseline) and 
they practiced in 22 of the 27 primary care clinics (vs 10 at baseline.) 
Pregnancy rates declined from 1.6/1000 women aged 13-18/quarter to 
0.2/1000 women in the same time period. The rate of decline acceler-
ated after the beginning of the intervention (p < 0.0001). LARC educa-
tional materials and toolkits have been disseminated to the KP inter-
regional obstetrics/gynecology Chiefs and family planning groups, and 
thus the socialization and spread of this initiative is already underway.

Discussion: A multimodal initiative that combined principles of 
adult learning, effective education, behavior change, and system-
based process improvement successfully transformed clinician 
behavior, resulting in increased uptake of LARC by adolescents at 
KPCO. Although this LARC intervention should be adopted as a KP 
best practice, the true promise of this work is to apply this compre-
hensive approach for promoting clinician behavior change to other 
important quality issues within KP.

27. Patient Partners Redesign kp.org Personal Action Plans
Hyewon Jun, MD, MPH; Gordon Ching, MBA; Julia Gregory, RN, BSN
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-071-27
Background: The Personal Action Plan provides members, regis-
tered on kp.org, with individualized up-to-date personal information 
on cancer screenings, preventive care, heart health, chronic health 
conditions, medications, immunizations, and more.
Methods: The Personal Action Plan engages members to close 
care gaps. Program/product from Southern California was presented 
to Hawaii patient partners. Eleven patient partners worked with the 
analytics team and providers from the Hawaii Permanente Medical 
Group to redesign the product. These patient partners represented 
members from Oahu, Maui, and the Big Island (August 2017). Two 
sessions were facilitated to gather their input and the finished product 
was presented to the Patient and Family Centered Care Advisor Council 
meeting on Oahu and Maui.
Results: Qualitative: Satisfaction from advisors and staff in par-
ticipating. Quantitative: Key revisions included changing structure to 
be more member centered, creating a framework for display layout, 
standardizing the “why” section text. The overall product before get-
ting patient partner input was quite different from the product after 
patient partner input. Use of the Personal Action Plans has increased 
since launch of the redesign (November 2017). 
Discussion: Take-home message: Patient partner input is invaluable. 
Learnings: Advisors could have been involved sooner. Staff learned 
that engaging with advisors was less intimidating than initially thought 
and exceeded expectations.

28. Nothing About Patients Without Patients:  
Strategically Partnering with Leadership for Patient-
Centered Outcomes 
Linda Fahey, RN, NP, MSN; Kerry Litman, MD; Susie Becken;  
Barbara Lewis; Diana Palma, MHA
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-071-28
Background: Engaging with patients/families improves quality, 
safety, care experience, and affordability but is not yet a “core value” 
throughout Kaiser Permanente (KP). Patient Advisory Councils exist in 
most KP Medical Centers but are not consistently used in improvement 
work. We will share tools and processes that make advisory councils 
and patient collaboration more effective, creating a “continuous 
cycle,” in which more positive results lead to more demand for future 
patient engagement, adding positive energy to this work.
Methods: Previously, KP had been behind the movement of creat-
ing effective Patient Advisory Councils and welcoming advisors’ 
feedback compared to many of the more than 5000 US hospitals. 
KP has pulled ahead as a leader in embedding the patient voice in 
health care with the strong support of our executive leaders. The 
KP Southern California (KPSC) Regional Patient Advisory Council 
(RPAC) has created a valuable model for a successful regional 
approach to improve person-centeredness. We have developed a 
powerful and effective workflow and improvement process with 
tools, surveys, and metrics leading to many successes. For example, 
groups requesting RPAC advisors fill out forms that provide RPAC 
with important information about the activity, and informs the group 
about advisors’ expectations. 
Results: The RPAC in Southern California has created an impact log 
detailing the effect that our patient advisors have had on a range of 
activities. We will share examples and an in-depth case study outlining 
how involving patients has positively affected KPSC’s Online Personal 
Action Plan (oPAP), developed to provide virtual access for patients 
to personal health information/goals. KPSC oPAP leaders collaborated 
with RPAC to create a more patient-friendly, effective program than 
originally developed. The KPSC oPAP system has become more effec-
tive, and more widely used after implementation of the new patient 
“codesigned” system. In addition, redesign of colonoscopy prep 
instructions, implementation of the redesigned ambulatory offices, 
pharmacy issues, and many other areas were improved by asking for 
and acting on input from RPAC.
Discussion: “Nothing about patients without patients” is a key 
strategy noteworthy for adoption throughout KP. However, the pro-
cess of embedding the patient voice in everything we do requires 
a clear process. RPAC has time-tested our workflow, incorporating 
advisors’ feedback to optimize impact. A comprehensive procedure 
ensures success for meaningful advisor participation on councils, 
conferences, committees, workgroups, etc. This session provides 
attendees with a road map and a playbook to demonstrate how 
embedding the patient voice can improve safety, enhance the pa-
tient experience, and save money to optimize patient- and family-
centered care.

29. Human-Centered Design@KP: Building Organizational 
Capacity in Innovation and Patient Engagement 
Loulia Kachirskaia, PhD; Jeff Hall; Jonathan Bullock
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-071-29
Background: This is a new time in health care. Engaging and delight-
ing our customers is a critical part of the Triple Aim. Human-centered 
design helps us uncover customer needs, define opportunities, imagine 
new possibilities, and rapidly test new ways to improve and design 
care. At Kaiser Permanente (KP), we take human-centered design to 
the next level by also partnering with our members through CoDesign. 
Methods: Applied to multiple projects.
Results: We have trained 1000+ KP staff in human-centered design 
and CoDesign. By using Human-Centered Design@KP, staff report the 
following benefits: Greater customer engagement, more innovative 
solutions, solutions that meet customer needs better, and avoiding 
working on the wrong problem.

30. Engaging with Members to Develop a  
Person-Centered Transgender Care Program 
Felipe Dest, MHA; Erica Metz, MD; James Kelleher, RN;  
Stephanie Detlefsen, MD; Erin Waters
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-071-30
Background: Kaiser Permanente (KP) is dedicated to providing 
care to the diverse members and communities we serve. Involving 
members in designing care and services ensures that we are meeting 
their health care needs in a meaningful way. A recent survey by the 
National Center for Transgender Equality (NCTE) illuminated that 
23% of transgender people avoided health care in the previous year 
because of fear of being mistreated; 33% had a negative experience 
receiving health care in the previous year related to being transgender; 
and 90% of transgender people surveyed believe there are not enough 
providers adequately trained to care for them. Both the KP Northwest 
(KPNW) and KP Northern California (KPNC) Regions engaged with 
members; through the CoDesign process, members helped to inform 
what services and performance improvements were needed to deliver 
high-quality, affirming care to transgender members.
Methods: KPNW: 
The Gender Pathways Clinic did not have adequate 
resources to meet the growing demand of members seeking transgen-
der care. It was difficult for new members to find resources online. 
Patient partners and staff identified improvements, developed action 
plans and measures, and conducted tests of change. These are now in 
place with future plans to create a full-time patient advisory council. 
KPNC: Problem: There is no mechanism to engage with transgender 
members to ensure the care program we are building serves them 
and meets their needs. Intervention: Develop multiple mechanisms 
for patient engagement (Focus Groups, Councils, CoDesign Teams, 
Peer Navigation). Comparison: No engagement. Outcome measures: 
Implementation of improvement efforts that members identify as 
valuable to them.
Results: KPNW: Within the past year, 2 new members are now 
participating in the CoDesign meetings, making a total of 5 members. 
In addition, the clinic has been able to hire 2 pediatric providers, 1 
licensed professional counselor, and 1 physician. The Community 
Navigator for the clinic has gone out to 38 different health care groups 
to educate staff about transgender care and promote the clinic. 
There is 
now a Web site for our patients and a folder for new members that can 
be customized on the basis of the needs and interests of each member. 
There is a plan to conduct prototype testing with new members to 
evaluate all the educational material that has been developed. NCAL: 
1) Operational improvements (eg, a change in welcome scripting at 
the injection clinic); 2) informed meaningful implementation (eg, 
informed implementation strategy of training program by identifying 
high-need departments); 3) environmental improvements (eg, provided 
significant consultation on art and signage for new clinic).
Discussion: 1) Understand the importance of inviting patients to 
design solutions early and often, 2) apply tools to engage in CoDesign 
with members and communities to build a care program that meets 
their needs, 3) develop tactics to transform information systems and 
create scalable trainings to increase culturally responsive skills for staff 
and providers, 4) build a framework for providing multidisciplinary 
care, 5) apply learnings from the KPNW and KPNC paths, challenges, 
and successes.

31. Putting the Patient First—Shared Decision  
Making at Kaiser Permanente
Andrew Felcher, MD; Matt Handley, MD
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-071-31
Background: Shared decision making (SDM) promotes personalized 
care that supports patients’ values. Successful implementation of SDM 
furthers the Quadruple Aim, augments care delivery, and accelerates 
implementation of evidence-based practices. Good SDM programs use 
high-quality decision aids and point-of-care conversation aids, train 
physicians in SDM conversations, and measure effects on both patient 
and clinician satisfaction, resource use, and clinical outcomes. Current 
adoption of SDM varies by Kaiser Permanente (KP) Region and topic. 
Methods: We present a few key studies of SDM programs that as-
sess SDM aid use, including patient and provider satisfaction, referral 
counts, and provider time spent, and compare them with usual care, 
such as patient education booklets, in common preference-sensitive 
conditions such as back surgery. The programs include both patient 
decision aids and point-of-care conversation aids. 
Results: SDM has been demonstrated to improve patient choices, 
provide a positive effective on patient-provider communication, and 
improve knowledge of and perception of outcomes with no adverse 
effect on health outcomes. SDM has received increasing attention 
from legislators and policy makers. In Regions where SDM aids and 
clinician training were readily available, use of the aids increased 
over time, and they have been favorably received with provider and 
patient satisfaction > 70%. However, KP still uses a variety of vendors 
and tools, and frontline providers may not understand SDM—many 
believe they are already engaging in SDM conversations. KP has not 
historically used a standard framework to evaluate SDM programs 
and aids. KP is actively developing new SDM topics and converging 
on high-quality aids, tools, and training.
Discussion: In this session, participants will learn how SDM is 
personalizing care delivery to help make informed decisions; how we 
are incorporating evidence-based clinical information and making it 
accurate and readily available to clinicians and patients at point of 
care; and how SDM benefits our patients, is doable at the point of 
care, saves time, and leads to better outcomes. For patients, previsit 
decision aids provide valuable information to patients and improve 
SDM. For providers and patients, we hypothesize that the most valu-
able SDM tools are embedded in the electronic medical record, are 
easily accessible, show clear risks and benefits, and are displayed 
in a patient-friendly format. We will be seeking audience input into 
the design of KP’s programwide SDM efforts as well as helping the 
audience learn about SDM in their Regions and practices. Our hope 
is that participants will adopt and reliably use the aids and SDM 
methods showcased.

32. Improving the Culture of Safety: Workplace  
Safety Unit-Based Teams Interventions that Work 
Barbara Zelinski, MBA; Leslie Pole, MA; Samantha Imada, MA
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-071-32
Background: Injury prevention is a value of Kaiser Permanente. In 
analyses done by Engagement and Inclusion, the Workplace Safety 
(WPS) Index has shown consistent correlations with department 
injury rates. The higher the WPS Index, the lower the incidence of 
harm to patients and health care workers. In addition, the higher 
the WPS Index, the higher the satisfaction of patients and employ-
ees. This work will share interventions that improved the unit safety 
performance. 
Methods: Survey of unit-based teams (UBT) interventions that im-
proved the WPS Index and safety outcomes. Interviews with selected 
high-functioning UBTs that improved safety outcomes and the WPS 
Index to become high scoring. 
Results: UBTs were provided tools to develop plans to address the 
four People Pulse items that comprise the Workplace Safety Index. 
Departments that implemented tests of change and later spread the 
interventions are experiencing fewer injuries and higher WPS Index 
scores. 
Discussion: Successful UBT interventions are not complex and do 
not need to be resource intensive. Many of the successful interventions 
were changes in how staff interacted, how managers communicated, 
and how the team resolved differences. Interventions do not need to be 
uniform across all departments to be effective. Successful interventions 
do appear to have common characteristics. Next steps: Safety plans at 
the department level will incorporate relationship and organizational 
effectiveness as well as systems of safety to create a safer environment 
for patients and staff.

33. Leading Inclusively—Utilizing KP’s Seven Inclusive 
Attributes to Build Trust and Increase Engagement and 
Team Productivity 
Susan Terrill; Laura Long, MBA
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-071-33
Background: Piloted at the National Diversity and Inclusion 40th 
Anniversary Conference with a select cohort of executive participants 
(National Executive Team, Regional Presidents Groups, Executive 
Medical Directors, and their top direct reports), the Leading Inclusively 
workshop is fundamental to helping participants understand the criti-
cal role participants play in advancing Kaiser Permanente’s Equity, 
Inclusion, and Diversity goals. To continue our journey to become a 
leader in pursuit of health equity and inclusion for all, we must inspire 
our own employees with tools and skills to lead inclusively; to tap 
into the wisdom of our diverse workforce; to act on self-awareness, 
lessen bias, speak up, challenge the status quo; and adjust readily to 
cultural and work style differences. 
Methods: We have an inclusive culture problem. By helping 
participants understand that each individual’s identity is an amalga-
mation of our shared experiences, we break down biases, build trust 
and connectivity, and minimize blind spots—all forceful levers of 
increased engagement, shifted mindset, and being agents for change. 
Results: In our Leading Inclusively Executive Round Table pilot, 
we conducted a pre-self-assessment inclusion survey. The aggregate 
survey results were then distributed and discussed among participants 
and followed-up by individual assessment results. The findings were 
fascinating; for example, in every trait of the seven attributes assessed, 
there was a large disparity between one’s own perceptions and the 
perception made by one’s peers.
Discussion: Build engagement and excitement around inclusion. 
Create and practice tangible new habits of inclusive leadership with 
yourself and your teams. Build inclusive practices into your regular 
team meetings, and generate commitment and behavior change.

34. How Our Unique Multidisciplinary Care Model Leads  
to Superior Outcomes for Cardiac Surgery Patients
Yong Shin, MD; Brian Timm, PA-C; William Shely, MD; Thomas 
Lampros, MD; David Tse, MD; Josh Andrew, PA-C; Julie Faulk, PA-C;  
Piotr Starosta, PA-C; Victoria Brownlow, PA-C
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-071-34
Background: The mission of Kaiser Permanente is to provide high-
quality, affordable health care services and to improve the health of 
our members and the communities we serve. A multidisciplinary 
approach to caring for complex patients has proven successful in 
serving this mission, which benefits our members and the health care 
team that serves them.
Methods: All cardiac surgery patients are cared for via a multidis-
ciplinary team. Our team—physicians (surgeons, anesthesiologists, 
intensivists, internists), physician assistants, nurses, pharmacists, 
physical therapists, dieticians, care coordinators, and social work-
ers—rounds twice daily on each patient. 
The commitment to rounding 
has established a culture of clear communication, daily goal setting, 
team accountability, and group decision making which has resulted 
in proven excellent outcomes including: markedly lower overall 
and coronary artery bypass graft mortality, decreased blood usage, 
increased early extubation, and decreased length of stay.
Results: Our multidisciplinary approach has led to the follow-
ing excellent results: An overall mortality rate of 0.5%, coronary 
artery bypass graft outcomes of 0.0% mortality for 2 years in a 
row, transfusion rate of 13.3 % compared with 42.6% nationally, 
early extubation rate of 78.9% with patients being extubated in the 
operating room regularly, and an average postprocedure length of 
stay of 4 days.
Discussion: Modeling the Kaiser Permanente Northwest multidisci-
plinary approach to caring for complex cardiac surgery patients will 
result in improved program quality and patient outcomes that further 
serve Kaiser Permanente’s mission of providing high-quality, afford-
able health care services and improving the health of our members 
and the communities we serve. Quality is becoming an increasing 
driver of reimbursement; therefore sustainability is directly linked to 
quality outcomes.

35. May The Schwartz Be With You: Fostering  
Ethical Care Environments through Schwartz Rounds— 
A Live Demonstration
Paula Goodman-Crews, LCSW; Deborah Kasman, MA, MD; Felicia Cohn, PhD
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-071-35
Background: The Schwartz Rounds (SRs) facilitated interdisciplin-
ary discussion fosters open dialogue about social, emotional, and 
ethical issues that arise in patient care. Attending SRs regularly has 
been shown to increase compassion, improve teamwork, offer new 
strategies to address challenging cases, and increase sense of belong-
ing, which also is associated with lower employee turnover. Employee 
and caregiver experiences drive patient experiences; hence when 
health care staff experience compassion in the workplace, they in 
turn deliver more compassionate care. Compassionate care has been 
linked to better outcomes including reduction in costs and higher 
patient satisfaction. 
Methods: Population: All Medical Center staff are invited to attend 
SRs to derive the benefit of improved compassion and teamwork, 
increased understanding of patient experience, and experience of 
different disciplines. Intervention: One-hour discussion facilitated 
by a trained individual. Each SR begins with four-minute narratives 
of three panelists who were directly involved in a challenging case 
and talk about the emotions generated. Narratives serve as a catalyst 
to engender similar narratives amongst attendees. Comparison: There 
are no metrics to discern experience of Medical Centers not offer-
ing SRs. Outcome measures: The Schwartz Center obliges contract 
Medical Centers to evaluate attendee experience, thus evaluations 
are completed after each SR.
Results: Kaiser Permanente Medical Centers currently offering SRs 
have reaped its benefits with more than 95% of participants gain-
ing new insights into patient and family perspectives, and those of 
coworkers; more than 93% being more open to collaboration with 
colleagues; 83% feeling less isolated; and 97% planning to attend SR 
again. Most Medical Center SRs draw from 40 to 100 participants. 
Kaiser Permanente Southern California aggregate evaluations from 
2015 demonstrates that regular attendance at SRs increases compas-
sionate patient care; promotes self-care; improves teamwork; offers 
strategies to deal with challenging cases; and increases a sense of 
belonging, which can decrease employee turnover. 
Discussion: Burnout rates of physicians are at an all-time high, ris-
ing to a mean of 55% across all physician specialties, which is a 10% 
rise in just 3 years. Nurses are experiencing rapidly rising rates from 
compassion fatigue and burnout as well. Building resilience amongst 
our health care providers facilitates better ability to cope with the 
psychosocial demands of care and perceived stress of care. Having 
SRs at our Medical Centers has helped our practitioners address the 
psychosocial demands of care, thereby fostering an improved ethical 
environment of care.

36. Nurse-Led Strategies to Improve In-Hospital  
Code Blue Survival Rates
Rebecca Campbell, RN, CCRN; Patrice Chatterton, RNC, CPHQ; 
Christopher Cox, RN, CEN, CCRN; Anna Sandgren, RN
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-071-36
Background: Nationwide, there are more than 200,000 in-hospital 
cardiac arrests each year. Of these in-hospital cardiac arrests, only 
about 54% survive the actual code event, whereas far fewer, around 
22%, survive to discharge. Rapid response team (RRT) nurses aimed 
to improve Code Blue response and actual code event survival by 
focusing on simulation education, cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
feedback tools, early team debriefing, and structured review of 
each code event to identify systems issues in a monthly Code Blue 
Workgroup.
Methods: In 2016, the Kaiser Sunnyside Medical Center (KSMC) 
Code Blue Workgroup committed to improving quality metrics that 
included the use of the Philips Q-CPR (Philips, Amsterdam, The 
Netherlands) feedback tool during code events, documenting end 
tidal capnography, early code team debrief, and a structured review 
of each code. Code Blue simulations were conducted with the KSMC 
Simulation Department and led by RRT nurses. The simulations were 
tailored for each hospital arena, focusing on code team member 
roles and competence using the Q-CPR tool. Each month, the Code 
Blue Workgroup members were assigned codes to review identify-
ing potential contributing factors, systems issues, and adherence to 
quality metrics, which are presented for discussion. 
Results: On the basis of the KSMC team efforts, survival of the 
code event increased by 18% during this time, or 63% in 2016 (n = 
52) to 81% of patients in 2017 (n = 58). Performances measures 
were tracked on the basis of a percentage target. Q-CPR use during 
codes went from 61% in 2016 to 95% in 2017, with a target of 
90% of code events that include chest compressions. Capnography 
documentation went from 36% in 2016 to 82% in 2017, with a 
target of 80% in code events that include pulselessness and in-
tubation. Early debrief by the code team went from 82% in 2016 
to 92% in 2017, with a target of 60% of codes. A structured code 
review by the Code Blue Workgroup remained at 100% of codes 
in both 2016 and 2017. 
Discussion: The most important factors in the success of this work 
is a dedicated Code Blue team and Workgroup invested in the pro-
cess and a robust action log based on team debrief concerns. The 
RRT team was present at each simulation and ensured consistent 
debriefing occurred. These debrief learnings were then brought to 
each Code Blue Workgroup meeting and entered in an action log. 
Concerns identified in codes that led to change included code 
compatible chairs in hemodialysis and a CareFusion Pyxis machine 
(Beckton, Dickinson, and Co; Franklin Lakes, NJ) located in the 
magnetic resonance imaging department. Given the success of this 
process, the goal is to replicate it with code events involving stroke 
or massive transfusion.

37. Workplace Violence Prevention
Robert Durand, CPP, CHEP, HEM, CHSS; Jeff Kostos, CSP
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-071-37
Background: According to the 2011 report from The Joint Com-
mission, hospitals saw a significant increase in assault, rape, and 
homicide from 2007 to 2010. Between 2011 and 2013, workplace 
assaults ranged from 23,540 and 25,630 annually, with 70% to 74% 
occurring in health care and social service settings, according to 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration statistics. Violence-
prevention programs reduce the risk of assault by training workers to 
recognize frequent cues such as drug use and threatening body lan-
guage, and educating them about strategies to help defuse situations.
Methods: Kaiser Permanente’s mission to provide high-quality 
care within the communities we serve requires an understanding of 
individual member experience and needs. As we strive toward con-
tinuous care delivery improvements, the implementation of a Defense 
and De-Escalation model supports our efforts to live up to member 
expectations, improves outcomes for all our members, and supports 
the workplace safety credo of creating a workplace free from harm.
Results: 1. Cultural approach critical: Assure we are grounded in 
the philosophy and basic tenets of our care approach. 2. Regional 
operation ownership: Ownership assures strategic alignment and a 
sustainable future. 3. Alignment with key stakeholders: Assure ongo-
ing engagement, avoid duplication and use collective best practices. 
4. Philosophy embedded in policy and procedure: Enculturation 
of a philosophy of care provides the foundation for all we do and 
guides the efforts to ensure collective understanding. 5. Standardize 
reporting with metric-driven improvement: Standardized reporting 
collects the necessary information to observe trends and help with 
decision making. 
Discussion: Protecting patients and staff from violent acts is fun-
damental to ensuring quality patient care. Creating the appropriate 
systems, tools, and education is vital to reducing the frequency of 
situations that may result in harm to our members and staff. The 
increase in violence in some departments, such as Emergency Depart-
ments, has resulted in difficulties in recruiting and retaining highly 
qualified personnel. Patients with medical emergencies deserve a 
place of care that is free of physical dangers from other patients, and 
care from staff that is not distracted by individuals with behavioral or 
substance-induced violent behavior. Every employee has the right to 
work in an environment free of harm.

38. Pain Rounds: Implementing an Interdisciplinary  
Team-Based Approach to Pain Management for  
Inpatient Rehabilitation 
Brian Theodore, PhD; Ryan Doan, MD
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-071-38
Background: Kaiser Permanente (KP) is renowned for excellent 
pain management across the system. In the inpatient rehabilitation 
setting, patients with acquired brain injuries and spinal cord injuries 
can often suffer from moderate or greater pain. To address the needs of 
the patient for timely, safe, and more effective pain management, the 
leadership at Kaiser Foundation Rehabilitation Center (KFRC) piloted 
an interdisciplinary team-based Pain Rounds program in 2017 as one 
of our departmental quality-improvement projects. 
Methods: Population: Patient satisfaction levels with pain care dur-
ing inpatient rehabilitation remained below our desired benchmark 
(ie, only 70% of patients reported that their pain was well controlled). 
Intervention: Pain Rounds are conducted 2 times/wk for patients who 
report a 24-hour average pain rating of > 4 on the pain numeric rating 
scale. The team is led by a physiatrist and includes nurse and neu-
ropsychology team members. In addition to prescription painkillers, 
other interventions offered include guided imagery, meditation, heat/
ice, massage, a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation unit, and 
aromatherapy. Comparison: Comparison of patient satisfaction pre- 
and postimplementation of Pain Rounds. Outcome measures: Patient 
satisfaction with pain management and longitudinal pain ratings. 
Results: Pain Rounds was piloted in a single unit at KFRC occurring 
2 times/wk. After successful implementation and documentation of 
protocols, we expanded it at the end of Q4 2017 to other units within 
KFRC and increased coverage to include any patient identified by 
nurses to have poorly controlled pain (even if 24-hour average pain 
rating < 4). In addition, a dot phrase was designed to be implemented 
into KP HealthConnect to better document pain ratings, interventions 
used, and patient satisfaction. During the pilot phase, we successfully 
elevated patient satisfaction levels from a baseline of 71% to a high 
of 80% (a 13% increase over baseline), exceeding the departmental 
target of 77.6% satisfaction. Data collection for the expanded phase 
of Pain Rounds is ongoing.
Discussion: We have developed a successful pilot for timely, 
adequate, and safe interdisciplinary team-based pain management 
for patients undergoing inpatient rehabilitation at KFRC. Next steps 
include 1) evaluating the usability of the implementation of the dot 
phrase into KP HealthConnect, 2) identifying the most useful interven-
tions that have resulted in satisfactory pain control, and 3) finalizing 
and disseminating our Pain Rounds model throughout the Region.

39. Optimizing Specialty Palliative Care:  
Five Key Strategic Initiatives
Dana Benton, RN, MS, CNS; Melissa Stern, MBA
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-071-39
Background: At Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), 
there is an identified need for expanding services upstream of hospi-
talizations to increase consistency in practice and to provide referring 
practitioners and patients with a clear understanding of what to expect 
from specialty palliative care (SPC) consults. We have implemented 
five large-scale initiatives to address these gaps and support our vision 
that all patients with serious illness and their families live as well and 
as fully as possible. 
Methods: 2017 quality goals: Long-term care plan (LCP) or pal-
liative care (PC) before death: Percentage of adult members with a 
LCP or PC before death; seven-day-a-week staffing: Percentage of 
Saturdays and Sundays with PC consult documentation. Optimizing 
specialty palliative care in KPNC and addressing the above gaps,

KPNC rolled out the following five initiatives: the development of 
a prospective patient registry, a transdisciplinary staffing model, a 
uniform approach to assessment and documentation, customized 
training for all SPC clinicians, and a comprehensive measurement 
strategy. 
Results: Prospective patient registry: Monthly medical record 
number (MRN) level reporting and identifying more than 11,000 
KPNC members in need of specialty palliative care. Transdisciplinary 
staffing model: The staffing model aims to ensure both access and 
care consistency for all patients who would benefit from SPC in 
both inpatient and outpatient settings. Standardized assessment 
tools and documentation: Three tools are used as part of a com-
prehensive assessment for every consultation. Customized training 
for SPC clinicians: Trained more than 300 nurses, social workers, 
and chaplains. Comprehensive measurement strategy: Measuring 
the impact of these initiatives included the production of monthly 
dashboards and leadership reports. 
Discussion: These five initiatives set a standard for what every 
patient across KP receives as part of initial and follow-up SPC 
consultation and allows us to be deliberate in our measurement 
strategy to drive optimization in SPC. With monthly data for 2017 
providing baseline trends, we have set targets for 2018 for registry 
penetration and will be considering process measures to assure 
continued provision of a transdisciplinary staffing model and use 
of assessment tools.

40. Northern California Medi-Cal Onboarding:  
Upstream Engagement 
Sarita Mohanty, MD; Bryan K Lee, MD; Molly Drebes, MS;  
Irene Alvarez-Zamzow, MPH
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-071-40
Background: The Affordable Care Act and Kaiser Permanente’s 
(KP’s) own efforts to enroll more Medi-Cal-eligible patients led to an 
influx of new members (85% increase from 2013-2017), challenging 
KP Northern California (KPNC) to meet the social, behavioral, and 
medical needs of this population. Medi-Cal members have a higher 
rate of avoidable, high-cost utilization; gaps in access to preventive 
care; and are more likely to face behavioral health and nonmedical 
social needs that impact their health, such as financial barriers and 
food insecurity.
Methods: New member onboarding (NMO) began in the Sacra-
mento Valley Area in Fall 2015 and has since spread to the Napa-
Solano Area and Greater Southern Alameda Area. NMO intervention 
has six key components: 1) family calls, 2) robust orientation, 3) 
resources and referrals, 4) scheduling, 5) medication concerns, and 
6) documentation enhancements. Process and outcome measures 
are: Initial Health Assessment (IHA) completion rate (physical exam 
and questionnaire), Emergency Department visits, patient days, clinic 
visits, and total cost. NMO evaluation has three components: 1) 
monthly IHA performance monitoring, 2) observational/case control-
matched evaluation (initial results complete), and 3) randomized 
control trial evaluation (results expected Q3 2018).
Results: Performance results indicate significantly higher IHA 
completion rate compared with KPNC for the 3 locations that have 
implemented NMO (Sacramento Valley, Napa-Solano, Greater 
Southern Alameda), (24.1% for the 3 locations compared to 4.5% 
for other KPNC locations). The observational/case control-matched 
evaluation conducted by KP Decision Support and Division of Re-
search KPNC showed that overall, related to the matched control 
group, Sacramento Valley new Medi-Cal members (cases) showed 
higher nonpsychiatric patient days, higher Emergency Department 
visits, lower clinic visits, and lower cost. The subanalysis of Sac-
ramento Valley Medi-Cal adults who completed the IHA (cases) 
showed lower nonpsych patient days (significant, 46% lower), 
lower Emergency Department visits (11% lower), higher clinic 
visits (significant, 23% higher), and higher cost (10% higher) than 
non-Sacramento Valley Medi-Cal adults (matched control) who 
did not complete the IHA. 
Discussion: NMO is showing promising results. NMO is success-
ful in increasing the IHA completion rate for the three locations 
that have implemented NMO (Sacramento Valley, Napa-Solano, 
Greater Southern Alameda), indicating early engagement with the 
member’s primary care physician. The initial evaluation indicates 
it is possible that the intervention had a favorable impact (lower 
avoidable high-cost services and higher rates of outpatient services) 
on members who completed the IHA. Next steps are to continue 
evaluation efforts, which will include the randomized evaluation 
(Q3 2018), quality outcomes, no-show rate, pharmacy script rate, 
patient satisfaction, and trending over time members that received 
NMO intervention.

Shaking up the Status Quo
David Wong, MD; Karen Sirski-Martin, RN, MSN, CCRN, HACP;  
Cora Bailey, RN, MSN, PHN, CLNC
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-071-41
Background: The Continuing Care Quality Management (CCQM) 
program models the Integrated Quality Management (IQM) philoso-
phies, tools, and principles for continuing care services of Kaiser 
Permanente Southern California (KPSC) beginning with skilled nurs-
ing facility (SNF) partners. The CCQM model enhances systems for 
service and oversight and moves our organization’s goal of matching 
patients with the “Right Care, Right Place, and Right Time.” This 
results in improved quality of care by standardizing workflows and 
setting expectations with SNF partners.
Methods: Previously, SNFs were used as a discharge destination 
because they were the path of least resistance. Patients frequently 
did not meet the medical necessity for skilled level of care. Because 
of inappropriate admissions, a rise in length of stay (LOS) and 
varying workflows in the SNFs, the increased costs created a need 
for workflow standardization, collaboration, and robust oversight. 
Implementation of the CCQM model of care in the postacute set-
ting, which was modeled after the IQM philosophies, tools, and 
principles, began in 2013. To measure performance, the following 
metrics were monitored: 1) SNF patient day rate (PDR), 2) average 
LOS (ALOS), 3) 30-day Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Informa-
tion Set (HEDIS) readmission observed/expected (O/E), and 4) SNF 
discharge rate.

Abstracts from the Kaiser Permanente 2018 National Quality Conference
Results: After implementing CCQM in 2013, performance mea-
sures significantly decreased from the 2013 baseline through the 
current year: 1) SNF PDR for the Riverside Service Area (Central, 
West, and East markets) decreased 16.7 points and 26.1 points for 
Riverside Service Area (Coachella Valley market), 2) ALOS for the 
service area decreased 2.7 days, 3) 30-day HEDIS O/E for the ser-
vice area increased slightly from 2016 to 2017 by 0.01; however, it 
decreased significantly from 2015 to 2016 by 0.08. 4) SNF discharge 
rate for the service area continues to decrease steadily: -0.7 points 
in 2016 and -0.5 points in 2017.
Discussion: The CCQM model of care enhanced the collabora-
tion with IQM and SNF partners to adopt consistent workflows to 
increase efficiency and quality of services at the SNFs. Our primary 
learning was and continues to be the high turnover rate of SNF 
partners (leadership and staff). To ensure continuity, continual 
education and engagement on the CCQM model of care is needed. 
The next step is to spread the CCQM model to our nursing home 
partners to deliver the same standardized care to our long-term 
care patients.

42. Effective Rounding for Quality and Safety 
Maggie Robbins, MPH; Lizabeth Taghavi
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-071-42
Background: Rounding for safety in department/facility includes 
asking staff about safety risks and observing environmental hazards. 
Rounding with timely, effective follow-up action is essential to safety 
excellence. Safety rounding increases communication within a 
department and related support functions. Regular rounds and ef-
fective follow-up can identify problems and risks, surface ideas on 
better ways to do the work, and reduce risk and inefficiency. The 
session will include small-group activities to generate discussion 
on key messages. 
Methods: Rounding is recognized as an important tool for em-
ployee engagement, and as the starting point for a comprehensive 
hazard identification and mitigation process. Safety rounds are an 
important leading indicator and performance metric and founda-
tional component of any safety program, and of the High Reliability 
Operating Model currently under development.
Results: Metrics related to effective safety rounding are on the 
list of potential leading indicators the National Workplace Safety 
Leadership Team is developing for use across the program.
Discussion: Kaiser Permanente is in the process of consolidating 
various rounding platforms into an integrated rounding tool that 
can be used across various specialities. The development of many 
different rounding systems indicates many parts of the organization 
believe rounding is an important process.

43. Pursuing Health Equity: Our Journey to Improve 
Diabetes Control With Our Hispanic/Latino Population  
at Kaiser Permanente in Indio, California
Frank Flowers, MD; Jose Fernandez, MD; Robert Blair, MPH;  
Patrick Calasan, BSN RN MHA
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-071-43
Background: Diabetes is worsening in our vulnerable populations 
in areas that are struggling to maintain the necessary health care and 
resources needed for glycemic control. Kaiser Permanente (KP) race 
and ethnicity data show a significant disparity gap of 16% between 
Hispanic/Latino and white/Caucasian members with diabetes. Indio, 
CA, has a large population of Hispanic/Latino KP members with 
Spanish being the second most preferred/spoken language at the 
Indio Medical Office Building (MOB). The Indio MOB was one of the 
first KP clinics in the area. There was limited awareness of cultural 
needs and a necessity for an internal quality improvement framework 
focusing on education of staff and employer groups, and complete 
care management. 
Methods: We stratified our selection criteria based on the disparity 
gap between Hispanic/Latino and white populations from KP Indio 
Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) data. This 
finding led to the identification of 38% of Indio Hispanic/Latino mem-
bers with uncontrolled diabetes. We implemented patient-centered 
diabetes support groups. In these groups, members shared personal 
stories, struggles, and advice on their own experiences with diabetes. 
We also included a manager leadership group to give its feedback and 
opportunities to help improve quality of care. We intend to employ 
telephone appointment visits, increase remote glucose monitoring 
utilization, implement a diabetes “One Stop Shop” model, and en-
hance community engagement. 
Results: Our results indicate that successful outcomes are crucial 
in making change happen. Here are several ways in which the team 
will review and create interventions to help decrease the disparity 
gap: Educate members on culturally sensitive food options; increase 
medication titration by improving provider inertia changes; engage 
members to check their blood sugars and offer new technology with 
the remote glucose monitoring; and increase diabetes quality com-
posite scores by being proactive with foot exams, retinal photos, and 
medication adherence. 
Discussion: Overall, the health equity challenge in Indio, CA, 
is very important to KP and its capacity to help address the social 
determinants of our disparity populations. This will help us to learn 
how to perform better with patient-centered focused outcomes. Some 
lessons along the way in our journey are: Knowing and understand-
ing the population of interest; developing lead and lag metrics for 
successful outcomes; availability of resources and tools needed; 
communicating plans to the member, staff, and community; and 
using interdisciplinary teams such as leadership, physician groups, 
and frontline staff.

Refractory Hypoxemia in a Patient with Submassive Pulmonary 
Embolism and an Intracardiac Shunt: A Case Report and Review  
of the Literature

ABSTRACT
Introduction: Acute pulmonary embolism is the third leading cause of cardiovascular 
death. Management options include anticoagulation with or without thrombolysis. Con-
current persistent hypoxemia should be a clue to the existence of an intracardiac shunt. 
Case Presentation: A 46-year-old man experienced acute hypoxemic respiratory 
failure requiring mechanical ventilation after anesthesia induction for elective hip 
arthroplasty. He was found to have submassive bilateral pulmonary emboli with acute 
right ventricular dysfunction and a coexisting patent foramen ovale with right-to-left 
shunt. He remained profoundly hypoxemic despite catheter-directed thrombolysis. 
He underwent surgical embolectomy with partial endarterectomy, resulting in clinical 
improvement.
Discussion: The management of acute submassive pulmonary embolism is under-
taken on an individualized basis because of the wide spectrum of clinical presentations. 
In this report we review the literature and discuss the evidence behind the management 
of cases of acute pulmonary embolism complicated by hypoxemia from a patent foramen 
ovale. In a case of acute pulmonary embolism complicated by refractory hypoxemia 
from an intracardiac shunt, adjunctive therapies in addition to anticoagulation and 
thrombolysis must be considered.
INTRODUCTION
Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is 
the third leading cause of cardiovascular 
death.1 PE can be stratified by prognosis 
to guide treatment decisions. Submassive 
or intermediate-risk PE is diagnosed on 
the basis of normal blood pressure in 
conjunction with evidence of cardiac dys-
function, shown either on cardiothoracic 
imaging or with elevated serum cardiac 
biomarkers. Acute management options 
for PE include anticoagulation alone or in 
combination with systemic thrombolytic 
therapy or catheter-directed thromboly-
sis, although guideline recommendations 
reserve thrombolytic therapy for cases of 
PE associated with hypotension (massive 
or high-risk PE). Persistent hypoxemia in 
cases of acute PE should alert clinicians 
to the possibility of an intracardiac shunt, 
such as a patent foramen ovale (PFO).
CASE PRESENTATION
Presenting Concerns
Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure 
developed in a 46-year-old white man 
during anesthesia induction for elective 
left total hip arthroplasty. Four days before 
the surgery, the patient and his wife had 
noticed that he was having episodes of pal-
pitations and dyspnea. He had been largely 
sedentary because of chronic hip pain. His 
medical history included morbid obesity, 
pseudotumor cerebri maintained on a regi-
men of acetazolamide, obstructive sleep 
apnea, and stable schizoaffective disorder. 
His prior cardiac workup, which was per-
formed in the setting of chest pain and was 
ultimately deemed nonanginal, included a 
normal transthoracic echocardiogram and 
a coronary angiogram demonstrating non-
obstructive coronary arterial disease. His 
social history was unremarkable, although 
his family history contained a Factor V 
Leiden mutation. 
During induction of anesthesia, he 
remained hemodynamically stable but 
had progressively worsening hypoxemia 
demonstrated on serial arterial blood gas 
values. He was sedated with propofol, par-
alyzed initially with succinylcholine and 
maintained with rocuronium, and received 
mechanical ventilation with volume assist/
control with a 100% fraction of inspired 
oxygen (FiO2) and positive end-expiratory 
pressure (PEEP) of 10 cm H2O. An arte-
rial blood gas test on this setting showed a 
pH of 7.29, PCO2 of 50 mmHg, and PO2 
of 65 mmHg. A transesophageal echocar-
diogram demonstrated right-sided heart 
dysfunction with a large right ventricle 
(RV) to left ventricle (LV) ratio and was 
positive for McConnell sign (contraction 
of the right ventricular apex with akinesis 
of the free wall). 
Therapeutic Intervention and Treatment
Acute PE was suspected, and an un-
fractionated heparin infusion was started. 
The patient’s scheduled elective hip arthro-
plasty was aborted because of the degree 
of hypoxemia. The patient was transferred 
to the intensive care unit.
On arrival to the intensive care unit, 
he was afebrile, with a heart rate of 91 
beats/min and blood pressure of 121/61 
mmHg by arterial line. Laboratory find-
ings included leukocytosis (15.2 × 109/L) 
with 3% band forms. Lactate level was 
1.39 mmol/L (within the normal range). 
Troponin I level was 0.05 ng/mL (normal 
range, 0-0.4 ng/mL) and did not change 
on serial testing.

Refractory Hypoxemia in a Patient with Submassive Pulmonary Embolism and an Intracardiac Shunt: A Case Report and Review of the Literature 
A computed tomography angiogram 
of the chest showed bilateral large pul-
monary emboli, nearly occluding the 
right and left pulmonary arteries, with 
extension into the upper and lower lobes 
as well as into the right middle lobe 
(Figures 1 and 2). Because of his hypox-
emia while receiving an FiO2 of 100%, we 
were concerned he had an intracardiac 
shunt. A transthoracic echocardiogram 
with agitated saline confirmed the pres-
ence of a PFO with right-to-left shunt. 
The estimated shunt fraction was ap-
proximately 40%. Because the patient 
had severe hypoxemia secondary to the 
acute PE, which was causing elevated 
RV pressures and right-to-left cardiac 
shunting, we performed catheter-directed 
thrombolysis with infusion of alteplase 
through bilateral femoral lysis catheters 
at 1 mg/h for 5 hours, and then 0.5 mg/h 
for 48 hours. The presence of a PFO was 
also confirmed during this procedure. 
The patient continued to have inter-
mittent desaturations despite oxygenation 
with 100% FiO2. The PEEP was lowered 
to 5 cm H2O, and inhaled nitric oxide 
therapy was started in an attempt to re-
duce the shunt fraction. Cardiothoracic 
surgery was consulted for possible embo-
lectomy in light of unsuccessful directed 
thrombolysis. However, our patient’s hy-
poxemia stabilized with the administration 
of 100% FiO2 and inhaled nitric oxide on 
30 ppm, with arterial partial pressure of 
oxygen maintained above 60 mmHg. He 
was unable to wean off inhaled nitric oxide 
despite 48 hours of thrombolytic therapy, 
so we made the decision to pursue surgi-
cal intervention. Surgical embolectomy 
(Figure 3), partial endarterectomy, and 
closure of the PFO were performed on 
hospital day 4. The patient was success-
fully extubated on hospital day 6.
The hospital course was complicated 
by right-sided hemiparesis that was 
discovered on sedation hold that was 
performed a few hours before embolec-
tomy. A noncontrast-enhanced computed 
tomography scan of the head demon-
strated multiple small embolic strokes 
affecting the left premotor cortex. These 
were probably paradoxical emboli in the 
setting of the PFO, without evidence of 
hemorrhagic conversion. The patient was 
discharged to a skilled nursing facility on 
hospital day 11. Table 1 shows a timeline 
of the case.
Follow-up and Outcomes
On follow-up with his primary care 
physician four weeks after hospital dis-
charge, our patient was noted to be 
well-appearing and without residual defi-
cits from his stroke. As of this writing, he 
remains on an anticoagulation regimen 
of rivaroxaban. He was evaluated for an 
underlying hypercoagulable state but did 
not have Factor V Leiden mutation or 
antiphospholipid antibodies. 
Written informed consent was obtained 
from the patient. Institutional review 
board approval was waived by the Veter-
ans Affairs Portland Health Care System 
in OR because the patient’s demographic 
information was deidentified in this case 
report.
DISCUSSION
The all-cause mortality for patients in 
the US and Europe with acute PE ranges 
from 9% to 17%.1 Acute PE is categorized 
into massive, submassive, and nonmassive 
types. Massive, or high-risk, PE occurs in 
the setting of persistent hypotension with 
systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg 
for 15 minutes or greater. Normotensive 
individuals with evidence of right-sided 
heart dysfunction, whether on imag-
ing such as computed tomography or 
echocardiography, or by elevated cardiac 
biomarkers such as troponin or creatine 
kinase-myocardial band, are classified as 
having submassive, or intermediate-risk, 
PE.2,3 PE may also be stratified by the 
PE Severity Index, which is a validated 
scoring system based on independent 
predictors of mortality.3 We presented a 
case of a patient with a submassive PE 
and right ventricular dysfunction. He had 
an intermediate-risk PE Severity Index 
score (Class III), which gave him a 3% to 
7% risk of 30-day mortality.

Refractory Hypoxemia in a Patient with Submassive Pulmonary Embolism and an Intracardiac Shunt: A Case Report and Review of the Literature 
Acute PE is often considered when 
hypoxemia develops. However, PE alone 
rarely causes hypoxemia to the degree 
seen in our patient, and it may be useful 
in such cases to perform an evaluation 
for an intracardiac shunt. On the basis of 
autopsy studies, approximately 35% of the 
general population have a probe-patent 
PFO, and 5% to 10% have a flow-patent 
PFO, which is determined with the ap-
plication and sudden removal of PEEP.4 
In acute PE, the PFO acts as a “pop-off 
valve” such that the right atrial pressure 
increases, causing a right-to-left shunt. 
The shunt permits LV filling and near-
normal cardiac output, thus preventing 
hypotension. However, hypoxemia ensues 
because of the intracardiac mixing of 
deoxygenated with oxygenated blood.4-8 
The presence of PFO was associated 
with a significantly lower arterial partial 
pressure of oxygen among 85 patients 
with a hemodynamically significant PE, 
in whom there was a 39% prevalence of 
PFO.4 Unlike many other causes of severe 
hypoxemia, such as in acute respiratory 
distress syndrome, the administration of 
PEEP often worsens the hypoxemia, as 
it did in our case.9,10 
We conducted a PubMed search using 
the search terms [pulmonary embolism OR 
embolus] AND [hypoxemia OR hypoxemic] 
AND [patent foramen ovale] for articles 
published between 1990 and 2016. In-
dividual cases, presented in either case 
reports or case series, were selected. Fur-
ther relevant case reports were extracted 
from the bibliography of articles gathered 
from the search. In total, there were 9 
articles with 12 individual cases reported 
of acute PE occurring in the setting of 
PFO and resulting in persistent hypox-
emia (Table 2).4,6-13 Submassive PE was 
present in 45% of patients, and of these, 
survival was 100%. In those with massive 
PE, survival was 20%. The overall survival 
was 45%. Two patients without hypoten-
sion received systemic thrombolytics, 
27% of the total.7,8 In one case report 
describing a patient without hypotension 
who received thrombolysis, the authors 
advocated for systemic thrombolysis be-
cause of the size of the emboli and the 
impending risk of hemodynamic col-
lapse.8 Surgical intervention was reported 
in 18% of patients. No patients received 
catheter-directed thrombolysis. 
Among 1006 patients with submas-
sive PE in the PEITHO (Pulmonary 
Embolism Thrombolysis) randomized 
controlled trial, systemic thrombolysis 
with tenecteplase resulted in significant 
improvement in the combined primary 
outcome of all-cause mortality or he-
modynamic compromise within 7 days 
over the administration of unfractionated 
heparin alone (2.6% vs 5.6%, odds ratio 
[OR] = 0.44, 95% confidence interval 
[CI] = 0.23-0.87, p = 0.02). However, 
there was no overall mortality benefit, 
and there were more patients with ma-
jor extracranial hemorrhages (6.3% vs 
1.2%, OR = 5.55, 95% CI = 2.3-13.39, 
p < 0.001) and strokes (2.4% vs 0.2%, 
OR = 12.10, 95% CI = 1.57-93.39, 
p = 0.003) within 7 days.14 
The ULTIMA (Ultrasound-Assisted, 
Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis for 
Acute Intermediate-Risk Pulmonary 
Embolism) trial demonstrated that 
ultrasound-assisted, catheter-directed 
thrombolytic therapy in patients with 
submassive PE resulted in benefit in 
terms of change in RV-to-LV ratio from 
baseline to 24 hours, over unfraction-
ated heparin alone (0.30 ± 0.20 vs 0.03 ± 
0.16, p < 0.001). There were no instances 
of major bleeding in this study. Patients 
with a right-to-left heart shunt, such as 
a PFO, were excluded from the study 
population.15 
Two recent meta-analyses,16,17 both 
including PEITHO, found that systemic 
thrombolysis decreases overall mortal-
ity while increasing major bleeding for 
acute PEs of both high and intermediate 
risk. The meta-analysis by Marti et al16 
found that 30-day mortality was sig-
nificantly decreased with systemic throm-
bolysis (2.3% vs 3.9%; OR = 0.59, 95% 
CI = 0.36-0.96, p = 0.034) while there 
were significantly increased rates of major 
hemorrhage (9.9% vs 3.6%; OR = 2.91, 
95% CI = 1.95-4.36, p < 0.0001) and 
fatal or intracranial hemorrhage (1.7% vs 
0.3%; OR = 3.18, 95% CI = 1.25-8.11, 
p = 0.008). However, 30-day overall 
mortality was not significantly differ-
ent when the analysis included only 
intermediate risk PE. The analysis also 
did not include ULTIMA.16 The meta-
analysis by Chatterjee et al17 found a 
similar significant benefit in the 30-day 
all-cause mortality rate for all acute 
PEs with a number needed to treat of 
59, which was counterbalanced by a 
significant increase in the rates of ma-
jor bleeding (number needed to harm

Refractory Hypoxemia in a Patient with Submassive Pulmonary Embolism and an Intracardiac Shunt: A Case Report and Review of the Literature 
of 18) and intracranial hemorrhage 
(number needed to harm of 78). Addi-
tionally, a systematic review of 35 trials 
demonstrated a pooled survival of 87% 
among patients with massive PE treated 
with catheter-directed interventions; 
60% to 67% of these individuals also 
had received systemic thrombolytics.18 
We could not find analyses from these 
trials that separately reported outcomes 
for patients with significant intracardiac 
right-to-left shunts.
The 2016 revision of the American 
College of Chest Physicians guidelines 
for venous thromboembolism,2 as well as 
the 2014 European Society of Cardiol-
ogy guidelines for acute PE,3 recommend 
systemic thrombolysis for acute massive 
PE (a Grade 1B recommendation in 
the American College of Chest Physi-
cians guidelines). Both sets of guidelines 
recommend against routine systemic 
thrombolysis in individuals with PE but 
who do not have shock or hypotension, 
unless they have clinical deterioration 
(Grade 1B recommendation).2,3 We 
elected to treat our patient’s submassive 
PE with thrombolysis because we did not 
expect his severe hypoxemia to improve 
otherwise. 
Although there are no comparative 
trials of catheter-directed vs systemic 
thrombolytics,19 we pursued catheter-
directed thrombolysis because of the 
possible lower risk of bleeding and our 
institutional experience with this pro-
cedure (Grade 2C recommendation per 
American College of Chest Physicians 
guidelines).2 In one systematic review and 
meta-analysis, the risk of major bleeding 
from catheter-directed thrombolysis was 
about 10% from 24 studies performed in 
both massive and submassive PE20; in 
another systematic review stratified by PE 
classification, the risk of major bleeding 
was 3.9 per 100 cases of catheter-directed 
thrombolysis in hemodynamically stable 
PE.21 In our literature review of similar 
patients, none of the reported cases used 
catheter-directed interventions; however, 
only 1 of these cases was published after 
ULTIMA.
Another negative consequence of PFO 
is the risk of paradoxical emboli resulting 
in strokes. Such patients may hypotheti-
cally be at increased risk of intracranial 
hemorrhage from hemorrhagic conver-
sion of these paradoxical strokes after 
undergoing systemic or catheter-directed 
thrombolysis. The coexistence of a PFO 
was associated with the increased inci-
dence of ischemic stroke among patients 
with acute PE in 1 observational study, 
with a 13% rate of stroke in 48 patients 
who were found to have a PFO, and 2.2% 
stroke rate among 91 patients who did 
not have a PFO. However, there was no 
between-group difference in the propor-
tion of patients receiving systemic throm-
bolysis.22 Although our patient was found 
to have strokes from paradoxical emboli, 
the use of catheter-directed thrombolysis 
in his case did not result in intracranial 
hemorrhage. 
Other management considerations in 
patients with PE besides thrombolyt-
ics or anticoagulation therapy include 
mechanical or medical support of RV 
failure and surgical embolectomy. Pul-
monary vasodilators may also be used to 
decrease pulmonary vascular resistance 
in situations of acute RV failure, such 
as acute PE. Inhaled nitric oxide has a 
rapid onset and short half-life, making 
it easily titratable.23 Inhaled pulmonary 
vasodilators were used in 2 cases in our 
literature review.6,13 Extracorporeal mem-
brane oxygenation (ECMO) can be used 
as another bridge to definitive therapy for 
persistent shock (venoarterial ECMO) 
or hypoxemia alone (venovenous). Ve-
novenous ECMO was used in 1 case in 
our literature review as a bridge to sur-
gery; that patient had concurrent cardiac 
failure and was reliant on a biventricular 
assist device.13 Surgical embolectomy is 
the definitive management for cases in 
which thrombolytics have failed or are 
contraindicated. The 1-year survival rate 
for surgical embolectomy in 1 series was 
80% for submassive PE, compared with 
66% for massive PE.24 Surgical inter-
vention was successful in resolving our 
patient’s hypoxemia. 
CONCLUSION
The management of acute submassive 
PE is undertaken on an individualized 
basis, given the spectrum of clinical 
presentations of such cases. The use of 
systemic thrombolysis should be weighed 
against the risk of severe bleeding. The 
outcomes of catheter-directed interven-
tions compared with systemic thromboly-
sis are yet unknown. In acute PE with 
refractory hypoxemia in which an intra-
cardiac shunt is the cause, there is even 
less evidence to guide decision making, 
because many of the large trials exclude 
patients with PFO or do not specifically 
identify these patients. When deciding 
between systemic or catheter-directed 
thrombolysis or anticoagulation therapy 
alone, the clinician should consider in-
dividual patient factors and the potential 
increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage 
because of a PFO. Finally, if there is a fail-
ure of systemic thrombolysis to decrease 
pulmonary arterial pressure and the in-
tracardiac shunt, then bridging therapies 
such as ECMO or surgical embolectomy 
must be considered. v

he joyfully went on a graduation

drove day and night to get to their 
campsite. One night after he had 
just moved to sit shotgun, the truck 
entered a construction site and 
slammed into rebar, which lodged 
in Robert’s forehead. Many surger-

on the neuro floor. Unable to move 
his contractured body, he only com-

Sinonasal Ewing Sarcoma: A Case Report and Literature Review
Jonathan K Lin, MD, MBA; Jonathan Liang, MD 
Perm J 2018;22:17-086
E-pub: 03/07/2018  
https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/17-086
ABSTRACT
Introduction: Ewing sarcoma (ES) of the sinonasal tract and associated primitive neuro-
ectodermal tumors are rare. To our knowledge, only 10 case reports of sinonasal ES of the 
nose or paranasal sinuses have been reported. Furthermore, there has been only 1 case of 
sinonasal ES arising from the middle turbinate. Recommended management of sinonasal 
ES stems from the management of its osseous counterpart, ES, but treatment with surgery, 
radiotherapy, and chemotherapy is varied. Five-year survival rates vary from 21% to 70%, 
with the lower rates representing patients presenting with metastatic disease.
Case Presentation: A 26-year-old man presented with persistent left-sided nasal ob-
struction. Endoscopy demonstrated a friable mass in the left nasal cavity originating from 
the middle turbinate with extension into the nasopharynx, confirmed with computed to-
mography and magnetic resonance imaging. There was no evidence of metastatic disease 
on positron emission tomography-computed tomography. Histopathologic results were 
consistent with sinonasal ES. The result of fluorescent in situ hybridization was positive for 
the EWS gene translocation. A multidisciplinary tumor board evaluated the patient. The 
patient then underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by definitive endoscopic 
surgical resection and postoperative radiotherapy.
Discussion: Our literature review found more involvement of the maxillary and ethmoid 
sinuses compared with the nasal cavity, and that the role of radiation and surgical approach 
was varied. ES of the sinonasal tract is a rare entity with high mortality, but few standard-
ized treatment protocols exist. Further study and evidence-based treatment protocols are 
needed. This article outlines the role of relevant imaging, a multidisciplinary team approach, 
and the optimal timing of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation.
INTRODUCTION
Ewing sarcoma (ES) is a rare and ag-
gressive tumor that typically involves the 
long bones of the extremities (skeletal 
form). The less common extraskeletal form 
involves soft tissues and rarely manifests in 
the head and neck region.1 Genetically, the 
abnormal t(11;22) chromosome transloca-
tion is a hallmark of diagnosis.1 ES of the 
nose or paranasal sinuses is a rare subset 
of ES, with treatment consisting primarily 
of chemotherapy followed by surgery and/
or radiotherapy. 
CASE PRESENTATION
Presenting Concerns
A 26-year-old man presented to the 
Head and Neck Surgery Clinic with 
persistent left-sided nasal obstruction. 
Flexible nasal endoscopy showed a left-
sided friable mass originating from the 
middle turbinate and extending into the 
nasopharynx. This endoscopic image is not 
available, but a very similar endoscopic 
image, performed later in our patient’s 
course of treatment, is shown in Figure 1. 
The patient was treated for sinusitis and 
nasal polyps with oral antibiotics, oral 
corticosteroids, a steroid nasal spray, and 
an oral antihistamine. Computed tomog-
raphy (CT) was scheduled for 1 month 
after completion of treatment. The CT 
scan showed a soft-tissue mass in the left 
posterior nasal cavity. 
Therapeutic Intervention and Treatment
After being lost to follow-up for 3 
months, the patient was seen again, and 
plans were made for a biopsy of the le-
sion. The biopsy specimen confirmed 
the diagnosis of ES. Magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) and positron-emission 
tomography were then performed for 
staging and treatment planning. Figure 2 
shows the extent of the mass as seen on 
the initial MRI. Pathologic evaluation on 
hematoxylin-eosin staining revealed cords 
of tissue infiltrated by cords and nests 
of neoplasm with small round blue cell 
features. Scattered mitotic and apoptotic

Sinonasal Ewing Sarcoma: A Case Report and Literature Review
figures were seen (Figures 3 and 4). Immu-
nohistochemistry showed positive staining 
for CD99 antigen (Figure 5). Findings 
were supportive of ES/primitive neuroec-
todermal tumor (PNET). Fluorescent in 
situ hybridization testing was positive for 
the t(11;22) translocation associated with 
the EWS gene in 89% of the cells. Flow 
cytometry revealed atypical cells that were 
not further characterized. 
The patient’s case was presented to 
our institution’s multidisciplinary tumor 
board. A referral was made to a hema-
tologist-oncologist, who recommended 
chemotherapy. The result of a bone marrow 
biopsy performed before chemotherapy 
did not show any evidence of metastatic 
disease via pathology or fluorescent in situ 
hybridization analysis.
One month after diagnosis, our pa-
tient started chemotherapy with a regi-
men of vincristine, doxorubicin, and 
cyclophosphamide alternating with cycles 
of ifosfamide and etoposide. He un-
derwent 4 cycles of this regimen. Re-
peated positron-emission tomography/
CT performed 2 months after the start 
of chemotherapy showed resolution of 
the previous hypermetabolic left-sided 
posterior nasopharyngeal mass, with-
out fluorodeoxyglucose-avid metastatic 
disease. However, there was a persistent 
nonfluorodeoxyglucose-avid, ovoid, soft-
tissue density that on repeat biopsy showed 
persistent disease. The findings during 
this biopsy are shown in Figure 1. Repeat 
MRI showed a small (8 mm × 14 mm × 
18 mm) enhancing soft-tissue mass in 
the location of the original lesion. After 
the patient was evaluated by a radiation 
oncologist, his case was again presented 
to our regional tumor board. The decision 
was made to perform surgical resection 
with another round of chemotherapy and 
possible radiation therapy pending surgical 
margins and final pathology. 
The patient was taken to the operating 
room for endoscopic surgery and removal of 
the mass centered along the left lateral nasal 
wall. Surgery was conducted with imaging 
guidance. A septoplasty was performed for 
improved exposure. The specimen was re-
sected en bloc, with good exposure. Margins 
included the posterior antrostomy, inferior 
turbinate, anterior lateral nasal wall, and 
uncinate and ethmoid bulla.
Follow-up and Outcomes
All intraoperative margins were nega-
tive for tumor. Final pathology confirmed 
residual disease with negative margins and 
no evidence of lymphovascular or perineu-
ral involvement. 
The patient healed well postoperatively 
and continued his original course of che-
motherapy. He did not require radiotherapy 
because of the absence of high-risk features 
and negative margin status on final pathol-
ogy. Twelve-month postoperative follow-up 
showed no evidence of tumor recurrence.

DISCUSSION
We describe what we believe is the first 
reported case of ES originating from the 
middle turbinate in a young man. By itself, 
ES is a rare disease, making up only 4% to 
6% of all primary bone tumors.2,3 Further-
more, ES involves the head and neck region 
in only 1% to 4% of cases, and tumors with 
a sinonasal origin form another rare subset.3 
Simons et al4 describes the difficulty in 
diagnosis of small round blue cell tumors 
as well as a systemic approach to aid clini-
cians. ES is described as part of a family of 
tumors with neuroectodermal differentia-
tion. More specifically, ES is classified as a 
peripheral PNET.4 Immunohistochemistry 
often narrows the diagnosis greatly. For 
example, a lesion that is positive for CD99 
antigen and vimentin would be either al-
veolar rhabdomyosarcoma or ES/PNET. 
Staining for desmin or myogenin would 
help direct the clinician toward a diagnosis 
of ES/PNET in the former scenario and 
alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma in the latter. 
Strong membrane-only CD99 positiv-
ity would again point toward ES/PNET. 
Clinical parameters can be of aid as well. 
Typically ES/PNET presents in patents 
younger than age 30 years, with men af-
fected more often than women.4 Molecular 
analysis is particularly useful if the diagnosis 
is already narrowed to 2 or 3 entities.4 For 
ES, the t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation 
corresponding to EWSR1/FLI-1 fusion is 
often diagnostic and used for confirmation.4 
However, variant translocations are seen in 
10% to 15% of ES cases.4
After diagnosis of ES is confirmed, ad-
ditional necessary studies include CT and 
MRI to help anatomically define the le-
sion as a baseline before starting treatment 
as well as for surgical planning purposes 
should surgery be pursued. Furthermore, 
positron-emission tomography should be 
performed to stage the disease and look 
for evidence of metastatic disease. Previous 
studies have found a rate of metastatic dis-
ease at diagnosis of around 12.5% for ES of 
the head and neck, and 20% to 30% for ES

CLINICAL MEDICINE
Sinonasal Ewing Sarcoma: A Case Report and Literature Review
of all sites.5 In one of the largest case series 
of patients who received systemic chemo-
therapy and in some instances radiotherapy 
as well, 57% achieved complete remission 
and 43% achieved partial remission.5 Local 
remission in this group occurred in 29% of 
patients, and distant metastasis developed 
in 46% during the follow-up period.5 Over-
all survival at 5 years in this group was 53%.5 
This highlights the potential aggressiveness 
of the disease and the need for clinical 
vigilance and appropriate follow-up care.
Although radiation therapy was not used 
in our case, its use should be considered. 
Despite substantial associated morbidity, 
including visual disturbances, pituitary 
dysfunction, and xerostomia, the report 
by Lepera et al6 in 2016 advocates for the 
use of radiation therapy in select cases of 
sinonasal ES (eg, for cases of suboptimal 
resection). No study to date has shown 
clear evidence of increased survival with 
adjuvant radiotherapy. In our case, the 
patient underwent evaluation by a multi-
disciplinary tumor board that believed that 
the patient would have a good response to 
chemotherapy and could be treated with 
salvage surgery before radiation therapy, 
if radiation therapy was needed. As men-
tioned in Lepera et al, given the favorable 
surgical margins in our case, radiation 
therapy was ultimately avoided, and che-
motherapy was given postoperatively only 
because the patient was in the midst of his 
chemotherapy protocol when the residual 
disease was identified.
Previous studies that routinely reported 
radiotherapy along with chemotherapy as 
an initial management option primarily 
included large tumors (> 10 cm).5 This may 
be because of decreased access to imaging 
modalities and health care, a hypothesis 
outlined by the authors of the largest series 
to date.5 As in our case, surgery is often not 
recommended as the first-line treatment 
given the substantial morbidity associated 
with large head and neck tumor resection. 
However, with the earlier detection of 
tumors and the development of advanced 
endoscopic techniques, treatment patterns 
may shift. Given the rarity of this disease, 
no uniform follow-up regimen is currently 
recommended. Previous authors have sug-
gested regular follow-up every 3 months 
for the first year, every 6 months for the 
second year, and then yearly thereafter.5,6 
Our patient followed a similar follow-up 
plan, with imaging as needed on the basis 
of clinical suspicion of tumor recurrence. Of 
course, any follow-up plan will depend on 
the aggressiveness of the tumor and patient 
or clinician limitations. 
CONCLUSION
ES of the sinonasal tract is a rare entity 
that has a high mortality and for which 
few standardized treatment protocols 
exist. This report outlines the role of rel-
evant imaging, pathologic, and cytogenetic 
studies; the importance of a multidisci-
plinary team; the timing of surgery; and 
a proposed chemotherapy regimen. Our 
patient received chemotherapy up front, 
followed by surgical salvage therapy for 
residual disease and completion of che-
motherapy without evidence of recurrence 
at 12-month follow-up. In our literature 
review, we underscore the gaps in the 
current research literature, including the 
role of radiation therapy, various surgical 
options, and the ideal follow-up period. v

ECG Diagnosis: Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm

Accelerated idioventricular rhythm 
(AIVR) is a ventricular rhythm consist-
ing of three or more consecutive mono-
morphic beats, with gradual onset and 
gradual termination.1,2 AIVR is usually 
seen during acute myocardial infarction 
reperfusion (following thrombolytic 
therapy or percutaneous coronary inter-
vention), and rarely manifests in patients 
with completely normal hearts or with 
structural heart disease.2 As percutaneous 
coronary intervention has become a more 
common treatment for patients presenting 
with acute myocardial infarction (versus 
thrombolytic therapy), the observation of 
AIVR by Emergency Department physi-
cians has become less common than it was 
during the thrombolytic era.2 AIVR has 
also been associated with several drugs (eg, 
halothane, aconitine, desflurane, cocaine, 
and digitalis), electrolyte imbalances (eg, 
hypo- and hyperkalemia), cardiomyopa-
thies, and during the postresuscitation 
period following cardiac arrest.2-5
Electrocardiogram characteristics of 
AIVR include a regular rhythm, 3 or more 
ventricular complexes with QRS complex 
> 120 milliseconds, a ventricular rate be-
tween 50 beats/min and 110 beats/min, 
and occasional fusion or capture beats. 
This rhythm has two postulated, possibly 
coexisting causes.6 First, the sinoatrial or 
atrioventricular node may suffer structural 
damage with depression of nodal auto-
maticity potentiated by enhanced vagal 
tone. Second, an abnormal ectopic focus 
within the ventricle may assume the role 
of dominant pacemaker.6 The ventricular 
ectopic focus manifests when the sinus 
rate slows down (below the ectopic fo-
cus) or when the ectopic focus accelerates 
above the intrinsic rate by 30 beats/min 
to 40 beats/min.2 When both discharge 
rates (sinus and ectopic focus) are similar, 
isorhythmic dissociation, fusion beats, and 
capture beats can be seen.
AIVR is usually a benign and well-tol-
erated arrhythmia.2 Most cases of AIVR 
will require no immediate treatment for 
this dysrhythmia, because AIVR is usu-
ally self-limiting and resolves when the 
sinus rate exceeds that of the ventricular

sistent with an accelerated idioventricular rhythm. In the setting of evolving lateral wall ST-segment elevation 
myocardial infarction, this finding is suggestive of spontaneous reperfusion of an occluded coronary artery.

For example, restore myocardial perfusion

My patient was 85 years old and dying of metastatic 
pancreatic cancer. It seemed as though her daughters, 
in expressing their angst over the death and dying of 
their mother, overshadowed the real patient. They 
consumed her waking moments, suffered loudly their 
mother’s pain so that she could not allow her own pain 
to push out of her; not through movement, no writhing, 
no crying, no moaning. 
The girls, in their 60s, insisted that pictures of their 
dead father surround the patient’s head so that when 
she opened her eyes they would be all she would see. 
The mother disclosed that she was distressed by 
these photographs. Her husband had abused her, 
suppressed her and her spirit. He took her from the 
Nebraska farm where she was born and belonged. He 
took her away to Seattle when she was 16 years old 
and never fulfilled his promise to allow her to go home. 
She wanted the pictures replaced with images 
of farmland and cattle but without disclosing to her 
daughters how terrorized she felt by the images of their 
father. She asked to be kept asleep so she wouldn’t 
have to bear her children’s loud crying, disturbing her 
busy thoughts about her own life. They would wake 
her to her pain and scream when they saw agony on 
their mother’s face, forcing her to beat down her pain. 
She could manage only a few minutes. They woke her 
over and over in search of their mother’s comfort—
Mommy is leaving. 
I had to orchestrate replacing the pictures with 
Nebraska farm scenes and keep her sedated against 
her childrens’ need … making up rules about noise, 
visits, needed procedures just to give her the privacy 
she needed for her dying moments. 
She ultimately got her solitary wish, her private review 
and her beautiful cow-covered grasslands and, I am 
sure, in her thoughts, made it back home. v

Meditation and Mindfulness:  
A Call to Action in Elevating Primary Care
Ami Kapadia, MD 
Perm J 2018;22:17-171
E-pub: 03/16/2018

ABSTRACT
Mindfulness meditation has vast physiologic benefits that can 
reduce physician burnout and improve physician well-being. 
Collective meditation and mindfulness practices with organized 
continuity among physician groups can synergistically elevate 
the practice of primary care by fostering creativity and innovation 
needed for sustainable solutions. A cohesive frontline physician 
voice rooted in higher purpose cultivated by meditation and 
mindfulness practices in a platform directly linked to quality im-
provement can lead to meaningful change in primary care for all. 
INTRODUCTION
Medicine for me was romantic when I was a student: The idea 
of making house calls carrying a black medical bag filled with 
lifesaving tools and treatments; the notion of being called to 
action in leading community relief efforts; and the privilege of 
studying a complicated case for endless hours like a mad scientist. 
As I was entering primary care, I felt optimistic about these op-
portunities. But then I burned out to the point where service to 
patients felt disconnected from my higher purpose in medicine. 
Cynicism had hijacked my mind. 
THE HEALER NEEDS TO BE HEALED
The all-encompassing breaking point was on a typical hectic 
day in my second year of primary care practice. I viewed my job 
as a relentless schedule, an overloaded inbox filled with clerical 
tasks, angry patients with chronic pain and disability requests, 
numerous quality performance report cards, and insufficient time 
to enjoy synthesizing anything complex. I did not feel like I was 
helping anyone. I did not feel set up to be a proper doctor. My 
practice felt stuck in a box of protocols, riddled with fear of li-
ability, and devoid of artful solutions. Toward the end of the day, 
one of my very pleasant patients looked at me during our visit 
and respectfully asked, “Doctor, you seem so tired. Is everything 
okay?” I thought to myself after he left, the healer definitely 
needs to be healed. 
RECONNECTING WITH TRUTH
From that moment, I embarked on a desperate journey toward 
reconnecting with truth in medicine. I realized that my attitude 
needed to change. I grew up with meditation, and I started to 
consciously apply my meditation practices to my work. With 
time, an internal shift occurred. I found myself naturally infus-
ing compassion, gratitude, and intellectual curiosity into my 
practice no matter how much longer I worked. At one point, I 
became chronically behind schedule and felt that this effort was 
not sustainable. But over time, I noticed a surge of creativity that 
enhanced my efficiency and stamina. My faith in doing the right 
thing increased. My member/patient satisfaction scores sharply 
increased. I felt liberated by living in the present moment, and I 
was deriving energy from putting patients first again. I felt happier 
and stronger in all aspects of my life, no matter what adversity I 
faced. My family benefited as well. 
My journey through burnout is not uncommon. The triple 
aim—enhancing patient experience, improving population health, 
and reducing costs—has been noted to be imperiled by physi-
cian burnout.1 Growing awareness in the medical community 
of collective physician burnout allowed me to identify this state 
in myself. From a quality and safety standpoint, there is urgency 
to this matter because we know that burned-out physicians give 
burned-out care. What is the solution? 
A SOLUTION IN MEDITATION
Meditation and mindfulness are ancient methods that have 
helped me. A growing body of literature and research has vali-
dated meditation and mindfulness programs for physicians as 
effective in reducing burnout and improving physician well-being. 
This particularly holds true when in a structured, continuous 
course with maintenance activities.2
Numerous physiologic changes have been shown to occur dur-
ing meditation when practiced regularly. Emotional equanimity 
is restored, and immune function is strengthened. By calming the 
mind in real time, the meditative state enhances focus, attention, 
and self-awareness. In a summary of a meta-analysis of multiple 
studies in experienced healthy meditators, three seemingly ben-
eficial clusters of activity were noted on brain imaging to sup-
port this view: The caudate in attentional disengagement from 
irrelevant information; the entorhinal cortex (parahippocampus) 
in control of mental thought streams; and the medial prefrontal 
cortex in enhanced self-awareness.3 
In Harvard Business Review, Seppala4 writes that “Meditation 
enhances creativity. Research on creativity suggests that we come 
up with our greatest insights and biggest breakthroughs when 
we are in a more meditative and relaxed state of mind. That is 
when we have ‘eureka’ moments. This is likely because meditation 
encourages divergent thinking (ie coming up with the greatest

COMMENTARY
Meditation and Mindfulness: A Call to Action in Elevating Primary Care 
Connection Between Creativity and Meditation,” Horan5 pres-
ents scientific evidence that creative thinking and innovation 
are boosted as “Strong associative thinking habits are suppressed 
allowing for the generation of new ideas.”
For me, the internal shift created by meditation that I de-
scribed also changed my outlook on primary care. I found myself 
more engaged in thinking about solutions and concrete ways to 
strengthen multidisciplinary care for various patient groups, for 
example, patients with chronic pain and disability, those with 
depression and anxiety, and noncompliant patients. The limita-
tions of our system started to appear more as opportunities for 
improvement that could augment joy in medicine as in no other 
time in history. 
Primary care evolved to reduce disparities and cost while im-
proving outcomes and quality. In 1996, the Institute of Medicine 
defined primary care as “the provision of integrated, accessible health 
care services by clinicians who are accountable for addressing a 
large majority of personal health care needs, developing a sustained 
partnership with patients, and practicing in the context of family 
and community.”6
I started to recognize that carving out the field of primary care 
with this patient-centric model was a grand and pure feat that 
aligns with the spirit of service. Resources and investment may 
have been underestimated with unintended consequences that 
have made it increasingly challenging to do the right thing, but 
such a movement expanded the potential yang to the yin. The 
intensity of our system’s problems enhances the intensity of posi-
tive solutions. In this sense, because of the existence of primary 
care, medicine is now exponentially slanted to leverage higher 
purpose with greater power in the evolution of an increasingly 
complex medical system. 
A HIGHER REFERENCE POINT FOR MEANINGFUL CHANGE
Expanding meaningful and effective change in our primary care 
system starts with transforming collective physician burnout into 
renewed optimism and creativity on a larger scale. I believe that 
we must build organized, frontline physician platforms anchored 
in continuous, collective meditation and mindfulness practices in 
the workplace. Such practices can cultivate a cohesive lens that 
more robustly inspires creative and sustainable solutions to the 
problems we face as we intersect with the business and politics of 
medicine. We could then channel our shared visions into focused 
improvement project planning. In this way, we can systematically 
redefine and redesign primary care within a multidisciplinary 
framework from a higher reference point. The ideal outcome 
is higher quality care in a safer system for more people. Such a 
movement en masse could benefit all of society. Primary care is 
truly romantic. v

ABSTRACT 
Context: A general practice in rural UK (Cumbria) was overwhelmed by staff burnout. 
Objective: To present a case study for how the staff of a practice came together, used 
data, agreed on a plan for improvement, implemented the plan, improved subjective distress, 
and objectively evaluated the intervention. 
Design: We conducted an audit using the electronic health record for patients com-
ing to the practice 5 or more times annually from 2008 to 2012 (frequent attenders). We 
planned an intervention to reduce utilization (frequency of visits) while still serving patients. 
The intervention used a genogram, psychoeducation, and up to six 30-minute sessions 
of solutions-focused psychotherapy, in which difficult interpersonal relationships were 
identified and efforts were made to resolve 1 major problem related to those relationships. 
Main Outcome Measures: Quantitative data (number of visits per year) and qualitative 
data about the changes that resulted in the practice from the audit and the intervention.
Results: The frequency of visits for patients with mental health conditions (41.0% of 
all frequent attenders in the practice) dropped significantly from 2007 to 2012 (p = 0.019; 
initial visits per year, 10.0, standard deviation = 2.51; final visits per year = 5.6, standard 
deviation = 3.8). The frequency of visits for patients without mental health diagnoses did 
not change. 
Conclusion: Intervening with frequent attenders of primary care who have mental 
health conditions improved their symptoms and reduced their health care utilization, with 
beneficial impact on practitioners and improvement in the morale of the staff. 
INTRODUCTION
Patients who frequently visit their gen-
eral practitioner (GP) often have multiple 
comorbidities and are costly in primary and 
specialist health care.1 More than one-third 
of Australians (35.3%) went to a GP 6 or 
more times in 2012 to 2013. Those who 
went most often tended to be older and less 
wealthy, were more likely to have several 
long-term health conditions, and were more 
likely to see several different GPs2 (as was 
the case in our practice in the UK). One in 
8 Australians (12.5%) saw a GP at least 12 
times in 2012 to 2013, accounting for 41% 
of the $16 billion Medicare Australia paid 
in out-of-hospital benefits. Patients with a 
large number of visits to the GP, called very 
high attenders (20 or more visits per year), 
were almost twice as likely as low attenders 
(1-3 visits per year) to have lived in areas 
of low socioeconomic status (29% vs 16%). 
Psychological interventions can reduce 
frequent attendance.3 Fewer patients 
contacted their GPs specifically for psy-
chological or social problems (46.3% vs 
38.8%) and fewer patients had anxiolytic 
drug prescriptions (15.5% vs 7.6%) after 
psychological treatment. People with men-
tal health issues make more use of general 
practice services and use more medica-
tion,4 even after controlling for physical 
health status.5 Bellón et al6 provided an 
interactive, 15-hour workshop training 
session on a psychological team interven-
tion with GPs in southern Spain. Of the 
137 frequent attenders registered with 3 
GPs randomly allocated to perform the 
intervention, 66 frequent attenders were 
randomly allocated to receive the interven-
tion and 71 to a usual care control group. A 
multilevel model was built with 3 factors: 
Time, patient, and GP. After adjusting for 
covariates, the new intervention resulted 
in a significant and relevant reduction in 
frequent-attender consultations. 
In a 2-year prospective study of 623 
adult frequent attenders in 2009 in the 
Netherlands, panic disorder, other anxiety, 
negative life events, illness behavior, and 
lack of a sense that they could change their 
lives were independently associated with 
persistence of frequent attendance.7 The 
authors found no evidence for synergis-
tic effects of somatic, psychological, and 
social problems and no evidence for any 
effects of GP characteristics. Also in the 
Netherlands, among 503 patients listed 
in 1 of 150 participating GP practices in 
2008 to 2010, people who had psycho-
logical treatment during 2009 significantly 
dropped their frequency of medical con-
tacts afterward (6.1 to 4.8).3 They con-
tacted their GPs less for psychological or 
social problems (46.3% vs 38.8%) and had 
fewer anxiolytic drug prescriptions (15.5% 
vs 7.6%) after psychological treatment. 
Although contact rates decreased, these 
clients of psychologists were still frequent 
GP attenders. 
This article describes a process of ad-
dressing the related problems of patient 
overattendance in primary care and phy-
sician burnout in a general practice in 
Cumbria, UK. 
METHODS 
Setting
The practice serves 5500 patients in 
a market town in Cumbria, UK, with 3 
full-time equivalent GPs (5 people) and 
2 full-time practice nurses. In 2007, the 
practice was at a breaking point—up to 6 
extra appointments added onto the end of 
every half-day. The staff experienced burn-

NARRATIVE MEDICINE
A Patient-Centered Approach to a Rural General Practice in Distress and the Search for a Solution 
frequently attending patients. Staff mem-
bers were tired and grumpy, and several 
GPs were using sick days sufficiently often 
to necessitate the use of locum tenens. A 
decision was made to implement an inter-
nal process using a talking circle format to 
explore the causes of this burnout. 
Process
The talking circles—a group communi-
cation technique in which only one per-
son is allowed to talk at a time8—aimed 
to identify the source of practitioner 
burnout and to identify simple strate-
gies to improve it. The group concluded 
that reducing the visits of its frequent 
users of services (frequent attenders) 
could improve the quality of life of the 
practitioners. 
An audit identified 163 patients as fre-
quently attending the practice. All 5 GPs 
in the practice were intrigued that each 
of them knew a little about most of the 
patients. These patients had seen each GP 
several times. Each consultation appeared 
appropriate. The notes were detailed well. 
The GPs noted, however, that most of 
the patients had symptoms that “didn’t 
amount to much” because they were not 
explained by disease. The GPs decided 
not to call the patients specifically, but 
to deal with them as they came for visits. 
An effort would be made to ensure that 
patients sought help from their usual GP. 
Unlike reports in the literature show-
ing that frequent attenders returned to 
baseline rates over time,9 a core group 
of patients in this practice were stable in 
their being frequent attenders over the 
years (at least 5 years). The results of this 
intervention were compared with those 
of 3 other practices in the same region 
for the same period. 
Intervention
As part of the talking circle process, 
the GPs assessed the skills they had for 
intervention and planned accordingly. 
They settled on a maximum of six 20- to 
30-minute individual sessions. If more 
care was needed, a referral was made to 
the Primary Care Mental Health team. 
The first visit was designed to establish 
the important relationships in the per-
son’s life using the genogram, a common 
tool in primary care, which graphically 
represents a patient’s family relationships 
and medical history. The second session 
consisted of psychoeducation about the 
effect of interpersonal conflict and life 
stress on bodily symptoms, designed to 
provide the rationale for the remainder 
of the interventions. The remaining in-
terventions consisted of problem-solving 
sessions in the major areas of the patient’s 
life problems, in the style of solutions-
focused therapy (for which manuals 
exist10). This intervention was strongly 
influenced by the work of Alasdair Mac-
Donald11 and his outline for conducting 
therapy. As is the practice in solutions-
focused psychotherapy, after the identifi-
cation of the most stressful relationships 
using the genogram in the first session 
and the explanation in the second session 
for how the stress from these relation-
ships was contributing to the patient’s 
physical symptoms and number of medi-
cal visits, the patient and the physician 
selected the most problematic relation-
ship on which to focus for the next 4 
sessions. Most patients, however, needed 
only 2 or 3 sessions. Included among the 
problem-solving techniques were some 
of the solution-focused questions,11 the 
7/11 breathing exercise (inhalation to 
the count of 7 and extending exhalation 
to the count of 11),12 and the explanation 
of the stress cycle.13,14
The intervention was implemented 
in January 2009 and was studied over 4 
years, although the intervention contin-
ues. Each year for 4 years, the 50 most 
frequent attenders were invited to partici-
pate in the intervention. We attempted 
to keep patients seeing the same GP. 
We gathered data on overattendance for 
4 years after the close of the study. No 
patient received the intervention twice.
We provided community trainings for 
other practices that became involved as 
a result of discussions in the commu-
nity. The other practices did their own 
frequent-attender audits. Their commu-
nities were equivalent sociodemographi-
cally with ours.
Statistical Analysis
Our primary outcome measure was the 
number of visits per year. We used multi-
level modeling methods (Mixed-Effects 
Models procedure of SPSS, Statistical 
Package for the Social Sciences Version 
22, IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). We had 
comparison data from 3 other practices 
in the region and used a coding variable 
for each practice. We coded each of the 
major diagnoses listed in Table 1, as well 
as whether the patient was on any of the 
existing chronic disease registries, whether 
s/he was receiving antidepressants, and the 
patient’s age and sex. The dependent vari-
able was the number of visits per year. Time 
of observation was nested under diagnosis, 
which was nested under practice. A number 
of potential interactions were also explored. 
Qualitative Data Analysis
In keeping with case study methods,15 
we attempted to instantiate and develop 
the themes that emerged from meetings 
with the frequent attenders. We did this 
to understand what drove them to come 
so often to the practice and to further 
assist some of them to meet their needs 
in such a way that they could consult the 
GP less frequently. This inductive process, 
as defined by Charmaz,16 relies on the 
“study of a range of individual cases and 
extrapolates patterns from them to form a 
conceptual category,” which then leads to 
a solutions-focused intervention. 
The clinical approach used is consistent 
with the goal for the GP to avoid domi-
nating the interview, as has been recom-
mended for qualitative researchers.17 Our 
goal was to understand the patient’s life 
and context in which the frequent visits 
were occurring and to understand what 
the patient hoped to accomplish by com-
ing to the GP. The aim was to elicit all the 
problems and all the symptoms to make 
sense of their presentation. 
The discussions of these frequent at-
tenders by all the GPs and nurses in 
the practice provided the function of 
triangulation described by Creswell.18 
Solutions-focused therapy is based on the 
idea of checking all inferences with the 
patient for verification, which is similar to 
what has been called member checking in 
qualitative research.19 Solutions-focused 
therapy uses an approach that resembles 
the constant comparison method of 
qualitative data analysis. This method of 
analyzing data returns frequently to the 
participants for clarification and further 
explication on a topic.20

A Patient-Centered Approach to a Rural General Practice in Distress and the Search for a Solution 
RESULTS
During the course of 4 years, 356 in-
dividuals were found to be frequently 
attending patients. Table 1 presents the 
diagnoses active at the time of visit for 
these 356 patients and shows which di-
agnoses are statistically significantly more 
common among the frequent attenders. 
The frequent attenders had an average of 5 
active diagnoses each visit, whereas a group 
of randomly selected patients had 2.86 ac-
tive diagnoses at the time of each visit. The 
mean age of frequently attending patients 
was 53.27 years with a standard deviation 
of 24.30 years. The practice decided to 
intervene with the top 50 attenders each 
year, a number determined by physician 
time availability.
During the first year, 2 of the top 50 
patients were seriously ill, and both died 
shortly after the audit period. The top 5 
attenders were all people with serious 
mental illness. Seven of the 50 had 
straightforward physical health prob-
lems, which were being managed through 
lifestyle and medication. Twenty-six of 
the 50 had a variety of medically unex-
plained symptoms, dyspepsia being the 
most common. 
The percentages for specific diagnoses 
did not differ among practices. Nor was 
the age distribution or sex ratios different 
among the four practices. Age and sex 
ratios did not change significantly from 
year to year. 
Statistical Analysis
The interventions enacted reached 
statistical significance for patients with 
a mental health diagnosis (41.0% of the 
frequent attenders). For them, the changes 
enacted in the practice reduced the rate at 
which patients consulted physicians over 
time (p = 0.019). A total of 186 patients 
received the intervention over 4 years. 
Time was nested under condition. The 
estimate of the slope was 0.3878 with 
standard error of 0.1532, t value of 2.974, 
and 95% confidence interval from 0.0358 
to 0.9199. The -2 restricted log likelihood 
was 794.310. No significance was found 
for the patients who did not have a mental 
health diagnosis. The number of chronic 
diseases, age, or specific illnesses for 
which there were registries was not signifi-
cant. Illnesses considered included chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 
congestive heart failure, coronary artery 
disease, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, obesity, 
thyroid disorder, hypertension, cerebro-
vascular accident, chronic kidney disease, 
asthma, cancer, dementia, and terminal 
illness resulting in palliative care. The data 
from 3 other practices were analyzed for 
this same period, and no statistically sig-
nificant changes occurred in the number 
of visits in any of the 3 practices during 
the same time period. The prevalence of 
mental health diagnoses did not change; 
rather, the rate of utilization changed 
after the intervention. 
Practice Changes
Table 2 presents the major themes that 
arose during interventions. Arising from 
conversations with frequent attenders dur-
ing the interventions and from the talking 
circles conducted with the medical team, 
a number of changes were implemented 
in the practice. These changes parallel the 
major themes that emerged: 
• Stress is a major contributor to frequent 
use along with health-related anxiety; 
the staff was given training on stress 
management. 
• Anxiety and health-related anxiety were 
identified as major drivers of patients’ 
frequent use, so staff received training 
in recognizing and treating anxiety.
• Frequent attenders had negative views 
of their mental health; positive psychol-
ogy21 can mitigate this to some degree, 
and staff received training in these areas.
• Patients reported more abuse and do-
mestic violence than was anticipated. 
Personality disorders were underap-
preciated. Therefore, all staff received 
training on personality disorders and 
on recognizing abuse and domestic 
violence.

NARRATIVE MEDICINE
A Patient-Centered Approach to a Rural General Practice in Distress and the Search for a Solution 
• Frequent attenders were anxious about 
getting time with the GP and being 
able to get an appointment to see the 
GP. They reported that the 15-minute 
appointment was too short, and they 
believed that the could not discuss 
everything they needed addressed. 
Changes were made for the GP to 
specify when the patient should return 
and for how much time. Patients were 
given their next appointment when 
they left the office. 
Independent of the patients, the medi-
cal team decided to delegate more work, 
including, for example, medical assistants 
taking vital signs instead of the GPs do-
ing so. All these activities resulted in less 
use of locum tenens by the practice. 
As the GPs reviewed the interviews 
with the frequent-attender population, 
they observed gaps in services or poorly 
functioning services that were not meet-
ing patients’ needs. During the first year 
of the program, this resulted in: 
• more regular meetings of the GPs with 
the health visitor and school nurse 
• better communication with the Pri-
mary Care Mental Health team 
• the realization that thinking about 
patients’ actual needs is fun and inter-
esting, and the formation of a commit-
ment to continue to do so
• the realization that thinking about 
patients in the context of their family 
and life situations worked better than 
thinking about patients as individuals
• the realization that thinking about the 
mental well-being of the practice itself 
was helpful.
As a result of hearing about the in-
tervention and the effects it had on the 
practice, nine other practices in the region 
began doing frequent-attender audits 
and were similarly pleasantly surprised. 
A consultation skills training group 
was created, consisting of a GP and a 
nurse practitioner. Talking circles8 were 
adopted as a means for enabling change 
in GP partner meetings and in manag-
ing interdisciplinary meetings with the 
patients. Frequent significant-event case 
discussions were held. 
These changes in the practice evolved 
during the 4 years of the intervention. 
Finally, a 60% reduction in face-to-face 
patient contact occurred when the GPs 
began returning calls to every patient 
who had called to make an appointment, 
to determine what was needed. Advice 
could be given and laboratory studies 
scheduled in advance, and often, a visit 
could be avoided. 
Case Studies
The following case studies of frequent 
attenders provide some of the richness of 
the qualitative data that led to the afore-
mentioned actions. All the patients whose 
cases are presented carried a mental health 
diagnosis of anxiety. All patient names 
have been changed.
Case Study 1: Dyspepsia
Margaret was 60 years old. She pre-
sented to the practice with dyspepsia, 
shortness of breath, hypertension, ab-
dominal pain, neck pain, back pain, and 
headaches. She was on the obesity and 
hypertension registries. She had also con-
sulted a mental health specialist for stress 
and related a few family worries but never 
went into extensive detail. 
Margaret sat down heavily in the chair 
and sighed. After dealing with her im-
mediate agenda, the primary author VY 
commented to her that she had been in to 
see the GPs with many different problems 
during the last six months. VY wondered 
if it might be a good idea to take a step 
back and try to make sense of it all. Be-
cause she didn’t know Margaret and was 
interested in families, VY said it might be 
helpful to map out the members of her 
family. Margaret readily agreed and sat a 
bit straighter in her chair. They filled in a 
genogram. Margaret’s first utterance after 
commencing the genogram was that, ten 
years earlier, her husband had announced 
that the marriage was over and that he 
had found someone else. He left the same 
evening. She looked visibly shocked as 
she described this event, which had left 
her with four teenage children. Her eldest 
son had just resumed living with her ac-
companied by his six-year-old son, whom 
she described as “a handful.” The boy’s 
mother had drug problems and couldn’t 
care for him and neither could his other 
grandmother. Margaret’s house didn’t 
have enough bedrooms. 
She said her other three children 
gave her an “average amount of grief ” 
and weren’t very helpful to her. She felt 
less stressed now that she was retired 
and had her pension. She described her 
siblings: A brother with palsy who lived 
in a residential home and a sister with a 
diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, whose two 
daughters were child care workers and 
whose husband was very busy at work. 
She then mentioned her frail, elderly 
mother. Her father had died ten years 
previously at the time her marriage broke 
up, a double grief. 
As Margaret looked at what she had 
drawn, she reflected that there didn’t ap-
pear to be much time for her. She said she 
had talked about most of her problems 
except for the divorce with her GPs, but 
had never put all the problems together. 
She thought this was very important but 
wondered how it linked to her symptoms. 
As the scheduled visit had run out of 
time, Margaret and VY agreed to meet 
again the next week to talk about how 
stress gets into the body. VY informed 
Margaret that she thought another four 
or five appointments would be necessary 
to sort out her problems. 
Margaret looked puzzled but grateful 
at hearing this and went out to make the 
appointment with an appointment slip, 
which would get her past the screening 
of the receptionists. 
The next week VY and Margaret re-
viewed the stress cycle, which VY drew, 
listing Margaret’s problems at the top of 
the paper and writing adrenaline beneath 
them. Margaret knew that adrenaline 
was the fight or flight hormone. VY ex-
plained the effects of adrenaline on the

A Patient-Centered Approach to a Rural General Practice in Distress and the Search for a Solution 
body: Sweating, palpitations, increased 
breathing rate, and stimulation of the 
brain (arousal, hypervigilance, and alert-
ness). Overbreathing lowers carbon di-
oxide, which increases muscle tension. 
This could happen in any muscle but is 
especially noticeable in the small muscles 
controlling the intestines, the esophagus, 
the bronchi, and the bladder. Spasm in 
any of these areas could cause neck pain, 
back pain, irritable bowel, indigestion, 
and irritable bladder. 
Margaret mentioned a few of these 
symptoms that she hadn’t reported yet, 
including palpitations and difficulty swal-
lowing. Margaret reflected aloud, “It all 
fits together. Each time I get a new pain, 
I have been convinced that I have cancer.” 
VY then taught Margaret how to do 
7/11 breathing,14 and she started to relax. 
The second appointment finished with a 
relaxation process called the 5-finger ex-
ercise.22 Margaret commented at the end 
of the appointment that she had never 
before felt relaxed and, now that she knew 
what it was, she was not going to let it go. 
During the next four appointments, 
VY used a solution-focused style to help 
Margaret problem-solve about her do-
mestic situation and the need to create 
boundaries for herself in her own home. 
She agreed to a referral to a local care-
givers’ organization (whose staff carried 
on with the relaxation theme). The staff
 
there organized more focused help for 
her sister. She read a self-help book called 
Women Who Love Too Much by Robin 
Norwood.23 At her last appointment she 
said, “Do you know, I don’t think I need 
any more appointments. I think I’ve got 
it and can do it on my own.” She has not 
been a frequent attender since that time, 
despite hip surgery and deep venous 
thrombosis. 
Case Study 2:  
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
Beryl was a 52-year-old woman with 
COPD. She had come to an educational 
event about COPD with 50 other pa-
tients, during which she had learned 
about the mental health aspects of having 
COPD and that breathing better could 
help her. She was married, with 2 adult 
children who had recently left home for 
work. She had had 2 “episodes of bron-
chitis” the previous winter, which had 
frightened her, leading her to think that 
her breathing was becoming terribly bad. 
She was scared for the future and believed 
her life was coming to an end. She had 
stopped doing what she had previously 
enjoyed: Dancing and seeing her girl-
friends. She didn’t work outside the home. 
She came from a family in which women 
didn’t speak up for themselves; they just 
accepted their lot. 
Her first genogram appointment lasted 
20 minutes. Beryl’s breathing was not too 
bad; she had mild to moderate COPD. 
She readily accepted that her anxiety was 
interfering with her COPD. Her hope-
lessness was clouding her judgment, as 
was her guilt at having caused her illness 
by smoking. On examination, her shoul-
ders were high and she was breathing 
with the upper part of her chest. Her re-
spiratory rate was 16 breaths/min, and her 
oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. 
She couldn’t manage abdominal breath-
ing while sitting, so she lay on the ex-
amination table. Gradually she unlearned 
her paradoxical abdominal movements, 
which were restricting her breathing. 
Then with each breath she learned to 
extend exhalation to the count of 11 and 
inhale to the count of 7, and then to let 
her shoulders fall with each breath out. 
Then she learned to breathe in so that 
her lower ribs expanded outward and her 
posterior ribs also moved. Her respiratory 
rate dropped to 12 breaths/min, and her 
oxygen saturation rose to 98%. 
Beryl sat up and said how very differ-
ent she felt—calm and purposeful. She 
agreed to practice the 7/11 breathing 
several times a day at home, and not just 
when she felt stressed. She decided on 
an appointment in 2 weeks for follow-
up. Physiologically she was much better 
and somewhat surprised. This breathing 
training appointment lasted 20 minutes. 
At the third appointment, solution-
focused questioning revealed that she 
had stopped dancing and socializing. 
She had also stopped talking with her 
husband about how she felt. One of the 
initial solution-focused questions is to 
ask, “What have you been doing differ-
ently since the last appointment?” She 
had already started talking with her hus-
band since filling in the genogram. She 
had realized that they both needed to get 
their lives back on track now they had an 
empty nest. They were planning a long 
vacation—their first without children. 
She was at 6 on a subjective scale of 0 to 
10, with 0 indicating the worst and 10 
the best. She said she had been at 2 when 
she first started attending the interven-
tion sessions. Moving up the scale would 
happen if she planned going dancing with 
some girlfriends. She decided she wanted 
to come back in a month. She commented 
that she hadn’t felt the need to use ad-
ditional albuterol since she learned to 
breathe properly. This appointment had 
lasted 10 minutes. 
Beryl returned 1 month later saying, 
“I don’t know why I’m here, [because] 
I’m fine; 9 out of 10. You shouldn’t come 
to the doctor’s if you are well!” VY com-
mented that it was encouraging to the 
GPs’ morale to see patients improving. 
Beryl said she had gotten her life back 
and was extremely grateful that it had 
been so easy. VY then asked a mischievous 
question with her consent. “I’m not sug-
gesting at all that you would do this, but 
supposing a part of you decided to make 
yourself unwell again, what three things 
would you do to be sure that you would 
get worse?” She was clear that she would 
start breathing from the top of her chest 
and deliberately breathe faster. She would 
stop going out socially and she would stop 
talking with her husband. 
“Why do you think I asked that mis-
chievous question?” VY asked.
After a pause she reflected, “Now I 
know the most important things to watch 
out for, so I can step in early, [because] I 
never want to go back like that.” 
Case Study 3:  
Previous Chest Surgery
A practice nurse referred a 14-year-old 
to learn breathing exercises. The patient 
had asthma and had been complain-
ing she was becoming more and more 
breathless. The nurse was puzzled by 
her case and didn’t want to escalate her 
treatment needlessly. This girl had had a 
thoracotomy to remove a large but benign 
lung cyst when she was 8 years old. She 
came with her father to the appointment. 
On examination, the adolescent was 
breathing with her upper chest and her 
shoulders were high. There was no audible 
wheeze, and her peak expiratory flow rate 
 98

NARRATIVE MEDICINE
A Patient-Centered Approach to a Rural General Practice in Distress and the Search for a Solution 
was 350 L/min. On examination of her 
chest wall, she had a neat thoracotomy 
scar. A large area around this scar was 
not moving. VY explained that she 
thought her body was still remembering 
the operation and could stop holding 
that memory. Her chest wall could move 
without any problem. 
They went through an exercise of 7/11 
breathing, with which she struggled ini-
tially until it was reduced to 3/5 breath-
ing. She practiced breathing into her scar 
area and was able to expand it surprisingly 
easily, pushing VY’s hand away with the 
chest wall, so there weren’t any contrac-
tures. She and her father were given 
a handout on breathing properly. This 
constituted a 20-minute appointment for 
breathing training. 
She returned a week later saying, “I’m 
fine; can I leave now?” This was a 5-min-
ute consultation. Her father reported 
several months later that she had reduced 
all her asthma medication, and he and 
the nurse were querying whether she was 
asthmatic at all! They thought the source 
of her breathing problem was a faulty 
breathing technique. 
Case Study 4: Severe Chronic  
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
Doris was in her late 60s. She had 
bullous emphysema after years of heavy 
smoking. She was worried that she was 
going to be put on oxygen therapy and 
that would restrict her social life. She was 
a lively soul. She had had several scary 
episodes of “pneumonia” in the previous 
6 months. 
On examination, her shoulders were 
high and her respiratory rate was 20 
breaths/min. Her oxygen saturation 
level was 92% on room air. After she 
learned 7/11 breathing, her respiratory 
rate dropped to 12 breaths/min and her 
oxygen saturation rose to 96%. In addi-
tion, she learned to add a second hold 
after inhalation. She was amazed with 
the improvement in how slowly she 
breathed and how calmer she felt. She 
wanted to understand how this miracle 
had happened, so VY explained how her 
rapid breathing wasn’t allowing oxygen 
the time it needed to cross the alveo-
lar membrane but that carbon dioxide, 
which diffuses faster, was getting blown 
off. This had the effect on her blood cells 
of not letting them release the oxygen, 
and it also caused her chest wall muscles 
to become more tense and reactive. This 
tension made her feel like she needed to 
take more breaths. 
In discussion, we learned that Doris 
had the mistaken belief that because her 
lungs were damaged, she had to take as 
many breaths as possible. She was very 
interested in the fact that if she could 
manage her breathing well, infections 
would be less likely because she would be 
clearing her airways properly. She found 
it difficult to maintain 7/11 breathing on 
her own, so she was referred to a respira-
tory physiotherapist for more intensive 
work. He reinforced the abdominal 
breathing. He taught her how to cough 
effectively and taught her husband how to 
percuss her chest to aid in sputum clear-
ance. A trial of carbocysteine also helped. 
She became more motivated to start 
early antibiotic therapy when she knew 
a “chest” infection was starting. She was 
grateful for the deeper understanding of 
her lung physiology and the better sense 
of control this gave her. 
DISCUSSION 
An intervention arising as a result of an 
audit process reduced frequent attendance 
in a primary care general practice in Cum-
bria, UK, among patients who had a mental 
health diagnosis. Monitoring the interven-
tion led to changes in the practice that 
improved the quality of life for its practi-
tioners. These changes were made by the 
physicians themselves using tools accessible 
to general practitioners and usable in the 
general practice setting. Other practices in 
the region became inspired by what had hap-
pened and implemented similar activities.
For understanding frequent atten-
dance, the severity of the patient’s distress 
was more important than how minor the 
GP felt the illness was. Knowing patients’ 
backgrounds (stories) improved care by 
providing a context for the GP to place 
the patient’s distress. Simple skills can 
have large impact, including teaching 
breathing practices to reduce hyperven-
tilation, the 7/11 breathing technique, 
and the 5-finger exercise. Genograms are 
useful to open the dialogue about family 
relationships. 
Strengths and Limitations
This study may be limited in its po-
tential generalizability. It arose from an 
audit process in one general practice in 
rural northern England. Practices and 
patients differ around the world, and the 
brief intervention employed here might 
not work elsewhere. The strength of the 
study is its demonstration that general 
practices can transform adverse circum-
stances through an audit process, can 
implement an intervention on the basis 
of the results of that audit, can monitor 
the results of that intervention, and can 
thereby improve the quality of the physi-
cians’ experience as well as the patients’. 
The case studies showed the impor-
tance of physicians being able to carry out 
these interventions. Although behavioral 
therapists can help greatly in encouraging 
healthful change, the GP’s knowledge 
of medicine and having a long-term 
relationship seemed important for most 
patients in this practice, at least for ac-
complishing change in 6 visits of 20 to 
30 minutes’ duration. 
Comparisons with Existing Literature
A meta-analytical review showed that 
90% of the 91 studies analyzed reported a 
decrease in medical utilization after psy-
chological intervention.4 The most dra-
matic effects were seen in patients with 
more severe forms of psychological and 
physical symptoms. It seems reasonable to 
expect that psychological interventions in 
primary care will decrease mental health 
problems, resulting in overall decreases 
in medical care utilization.4,24 Our report 
shows that psychological interventions 
can be done by the general practitioner 
within the timeframe typically allowed 
Monitoring the intervention led to changes in the practice that 
improved the quality of life for its practitioners. These changes 
were made by the physicians themselves using tools accessible to 
general practitioners and usable in the general practice setting.

CONCLUSION
Further work is indicated to understand 
how to optimally deliver medical care to 
people with multiple physical complaints 
who visit the GP often. This report shows 
that psychological intervention among fre-
quent attenders decreases their use of pri-
mary care, improves GP and staff morale, 
and is possible in a rural general practice 
setting. Further work is also needed on 
how practices can self-audit and use those 
processes to change their process of care 
and solve problems. v

It was another busy night on the 
floor of Labor and Delivery. I was 
a brand-new medical student on 
rotation. 
Just sitting in the fishbowl. Fish-
bowl—funny thing. They sat us at 
a desk in the middle of the ward, 
surrounded by glass walls. Fishbowl.
Even from inside, I could hear the 
muffled moans of women in labor. I 
could see nurses busily going from 
room to room. I felt a little protected 
in the fishbowl, but also helpless.
Then came a call—they needed 
help in Room 8. A woman was go-
ing to deliver soon. So off I went 
with the nurse. Having never seen 
a woman in labor, I was taken 
aback. She was in pain. How do I 
help? Her family was nervous and 
exhausted from the long labor. 
What should I do?
The attending physician came 
in, and like a ray of light, brought 
new energy into the room. The fam-
ily jumped up. It was time to push!
I fumbled to unlock the bed and 
managed to not get run over as we 
moved into the Delivery Room.
“Gown up!” the attending told me. 
He must’ve seen the look of inexpe-
rience on my face. “Like this. Now, 
hand here.”
What? Why?
“Hold your hands like this.”
Really?
The woman gave a deep groan 
and started pushing. I saw the head 
of the baby start to emerge. Then I 
was guiding the baby out.
“Hold tight. They’re slippery little 
devils.”
I ran my hand down the back of 
the baby and cradled him until he 
was finally free.
I heard nothing then. No shouts 
of joy. No “It’s a boy!” No crying of 
relief. I just saw the baby, with his 
scrunched-up face, slightly blue and 
slippery.
Then I felt a nudge. It was the 
attending. He said, “You don’t need 
to hold that tight; the kid’s got to 
breathe.”
“Sorry!” In that moment I knew my 
life was going to be in the fishbowl. v

Implementing a Narrative Medicine Curriculum During the Internship 
Year: An Internal Medicine Residency Program Experience

Perm J 2018;22:17-187
E-pub: 04/18/2018

ABSTRACT
Introduction: Narrative medicine develops professional and communication skills 
that align with Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education competencies. 
However, little is known about a narrative medicine curriculum’s impact on physicians 
in training during residency. Implementing a narrative medicine curriculum during 
residency can be challenging because of time constraints and limited opportunity for 
nonclinical education. 
Methods: Six sessions were implemented throughout one academic year to expose 
first-year internal medicine residents (interns) to narrative medicine. Attendance and 
participation were documented. At the end of the year, interns completed an open-ended 
survey to gauge their perception of their experience with the sessions. 
Results: In total, 17 interns attended at least 1 narrative medicine session, and 
each session averaged 5.4 attendees. Thirteen eligible interns completed the survey. 
Thematic analysis identified 3 predominant themes: Mindfulness, physician well-being, 
and professionalism. 
Discussion: Overall, the narrative medicine sessions were well attended and the cur-
riculum was well received. This intervention demonstrates the value of a narrative medicine 
curriculum during medical resident training. Large prospective studies are necessary to 
identify the long-term benefits of such a curriculum. 
INTRODUCTION
In 2001, Rita Charon defined narra-
tive medicine as listening, reflecting, and 
responding to patient stories to promote 
healing.1 The use of narrative techniques 
in medicine, however, is not novel. Medi-
cine is saturated with storytelling.2,3 
Today’s rigorous medical school cur-
riculum focuses on seven areas ranging 
from biomedical sciences to interprofes-
sional collaborative skills, leaving little 
room to teach medical humanities.4 The 
assumption that medicine is an objective 
science based on technical skills and 
the perception that the humanities lack 
clinical relevance further hinder the in-
clusion of humanities in the curriculum.5 
Narrative medicine does not propose a 
completely new practice, but rather a 
new framework within which to conduct 
current medical practice.1 A narrative 
medicine curriculum was first devel-
oped at Columbia University College 
of Physicians and Surgeons in 2000.6 
Since then, other medical schools have 
introduced narrative components into 
their curricula,7-9 recognizing value in de-
veloping professionalism skills. Narrative 
medicine also can help medical students 
meet Accreditation Council for Gradu-
ate Medical Education competencies, 
including interpersonal and communica-
tion skills and professionalism.10,11 
Medical students respond favorably 
to narrative medicine curricula.6,10 How-
ever, little is known about the benefits of 
a narrative medicine curriculum during 
residency training and thereafter.12 Few 
structured efforts encouraging narrative 
medicine during residency training exist 
even though narrative skills are essential 
to ensure effective physician-patient 
and physician-physician communica-
tion.13,14 Single-center and multicenter 
studies demonstrate the increased risk 
for burnout attributable to emotional 
exhaustion and depersonalization dur-
ing the internal medicine internship year 
of residency.15,16 A narrative component 
to medical education can help foster a 
professional identity on the basis of af-
filiation, representation, and attention, 
which are needed in graduate medical 
education to balance the confusion, 
depression, and frustration often expe-
rienced during residency.
It is a challenge to implement a nar-
rative medicine or other humanities 
curriculum during residency. Liao and 
associates14 highlighted four barriers to 
implementation: The increased complex-
ity of care delivery and duty hours limit 
activities in nonclinical education; the 
Budget Control Act cut indirect medical 
education funding, prioritizing clinical 
activities; most residency programs do 
not have the structure or culture nec-
essary to support a narrative medicine 
curriculum; and nonclinical activities 
focus on research, quality improvement, 
and other medical education valued in 
fellowship and job applications. A 2013 
study discussed resistance among faculty 
and residents who were unfamiliar with 
narrative medicine and cited this lack of 
knowledge as a barrier to implementa-
tion.10 Nevertheless, opportunities exist 
within training to provide residents with 
the opportunity to engage in narrative 
and reflection activities. These opportu-
nities include implementing activities 
during residents’ protected time (morn-
ing report or noon conference), using 
in-house resources (building space, 
library, and art displays), and encourag-
ing residents to participate in unfamiliar 
activities. In an effort to stimulate and 
encourage writing and reflection in 
medicine, the Louisiana State University 
Health Sciences Center (LSUHSC) In-
ternal Medicine Residency Program in 
Baton Rouge implemented a narrative

NARRATIVE MEDICINE
Implementing a Narrative Medicine Curriculum During the Internship Year: An Internal Medicine Residency Program Experience
medicine curriculum for first-year house 
officers (interns). The benefits of this pilot 
program are discussed here. 
METHODS
During the 2015-2016 academic year 
at the LSUHSC Internal Medicine Pro-
gram in Baton Rouge, incoming interns 
were invited to participate in a series of 
reflective sessions based on a narrative 
medicine curriculum. Each of 6 sessions 
was offered twice, for a total of 12 sessions 
throughout the academic year. To increase 
participation, the first occurrence of each 
session took place during the evening, and 
the next occurrence of the same session 
took place the next month during noon 
conference. Noon conference is part of 
a resident’s protected time for didactic 
activities, so the ability to make use of 
this time every other month ensured that 
interested interns could attend a session. 
One week before the session, we e-mailed 
reminders to all interns with time and 
place information. Participation was 
voluntary, and interns were encouraged 
to attend at least 4 sessions throughout 
the year.
Each session consisted of a 30-minute 
discussion of a short essay, poem, article, 
or movie, followed by a 5-minute narra-
tive exercise and a 10-minute wrap-up 
conversation. Narrative exercises included 
prompts that encouraged interns to 
briefly write and subsequently read aloud 
to the group. A discussion that followed 
the writing exercise allowed participants 
to reflect on their experiences with the 
group. Interns were allowed to keep their 
written narrations to protect confidenti-
ality and encourage honest writing prac-
tices. The sessions took place in 2 areas 
of the LSUHSC Medical Education and 
Innovation Center that were designed 
with the value of medical education in 
mind: The Reconciliation Room, which is 
designed to encourage constructive feed-
back and foster feelings of completion, 
lack of hierarchy, wholeness, and unity 
(participants sit at a large round table to 
eliminate the sense of hierarchy), and the 
Teaching Terrace, which is an open out-
door space designed to foster humanism 
attributes in trainees.17 
After the last sessions, we surveyed the 
interns using an anonymous, open-ended 
questionnaire to assess their perception of 
the narrative medicine sessions attended 
during their intern year. The survey con-
sisted of 6 questions previously developed 
by Arntfield and associates.10 Four addi-
tional questions captured the interns’ time 
and location preferences (see Sidebar: 
Ten-Item Narrative Medicine Sessions 
Survey). The final 10-item paper-based 
survey was completed 1 week after the 
last narrative medicine session of the 
internship year in June 2016. Survey re-
sponses were entered into a database, and 
thematic analysis was performed for each 
question. Responses had to be categorized 
into the same theme by at least 2 readers 
for inclusion. Survey procedures were 
approved by the LSUHSC New Orleans 
institutional review board (IRB 9410).
RESULTS
Among 18 interns, 17 attended at least 
1 session; 6 were preliminary and 8 were 
categorical interns, and 12 were men and 
5 were women. On average, participants 
attended 3.8 sessions, with each session 
averaging 5.4 attendees. Thirteen interns 
completed the survey at the conclu-
sion of the year. Course feedback was 
overwhelmingly positive, with 3 consis-
tent themes emerging in the responses: 
Mindfulness, physician wellness, and 
professionalism. Interns defined mindful-
ness as increased personal reflection and 
awareness of patient feelings; physician 
wellness as good health and the ability 
to share difficult experiences to promote 
emotional well-being; and professional-
ism as strengthening of peer comradery, 
humanism, and public speaking skills. 
These themes are further discussed below.
Mindfulness 
The interns stated that the sessions 
they attended gave them an avenue for 
personal reflection and encouraged them 
to be more thoughtful, both personally 
and professionally. Respondents stated 
that personal reflection led to increased 
awareness of emotions, insight into experi-
ences encountered during their intern year, 
and a better understanding of the things 
that truly are significant in the fast-paced 
world of medicine. Moreover, reflection 
challenged them to be mindful of patient 
feelings and patient experiences. Most 
responses included statements on patient 
empathy acquired through awareness and 
reflection. Interns also revealed heightened 
empathy toward each other and their peers 
in the medical profession: 
I enjoyed the sessions. I felt as though 
they helped me take a step back and evalu-
ate my views and attitudes. I think it 
helped me to refocus on patient care and 
let go of the frustrations of intern year.
[The sessions were] a wonderful op-
portunity to reflect on our experiences and 
relate to one another. I now know that 
more people have the same feelings and 
struggles as me than I initially thought. 
It will help me to better understand col-
leagues. This course also helped me better 
empathize with my patients.
Physician Wellness
Many sessions led to discussions about 
the role of a physician in modern soci-
ety. Interns reported feeling stressed and 
overwhelmed by the daily requirements of 
internship training, which leave little time 
for reflective or emotional outlets. There 
was a general consensus that the intern-
ship year can lead to compassion fatigue. 
The interns said the sessions had a positive 
impact on their emotional health and that 
narrative medicine was one of the only 
nonmedical outlets they had encountered 
throughout their medical education: 
Talking about compassion fatigue is 
something that really struck me. Discuss-
ing this subject allowed me better insight 
into how I feel at times and how others 
may be feeling.
Unlike other avenues for dealing with 
stress and fatigue, I felt that the abilities 
Respondents stated that personal reflection led to increased 
awareness of emotions, insight into experiences encountered 
during their intern year, and a better understanding of the things 
that truly are significant in the fast-paced world of medicine.

NARRATIVE MEDICINE
Implementing a Narrative Medicine Curriculum During the Internship Year: An Internal Medicine Residency Program Experience
to discuss things with peers provided a 
uniquely cathartic way to air out feelings. 
I left every session feeling more at peace 
than when it started.
Professionalism
Throughout the narrative medicine 
sessions, multiple recurring topics that 
involve the Accreditation Council for 
Graduate Medical Education definition 
of professionalism were discussed. Re-
spondents indicated that participating in 
the sessions led to an increase in peer ca-
maraderie, which strengthened their sense 
of affiliation to each other and to the insti-
tution. Peer-to-peer bonding was possible 
through the sharing of difficult experiences 
and emotions encountered during medical 
training. Interprofessional communication 
is an essential component of professional-
ism according to Accreditation Council for 
Graduate Medical Education standards. 
Residents reported that these discussions 
strengthened their communication skills 
by improving their ability to listen and 
encouraging public discussion about dif-
ficult topics. Respondents also revealed 
there was no other venue in which they 
could discuss these difficult topics, and 
that such conversations are not encour-
aged in medicine.
I thought it was a great opportunity to 
bond with my classmates and talk about 
our experiences … it allowed me to learn 
the importance of discussing your opinions 
and thoughts with others, which can be in-
valuable to help improve stress and anxiety.
The sessions did help to push us to open 
up and share things that otherwise may not 
have been discussed de novo amongst us.
When asked about the structure of the 
narrative medicine sessions, respondents 
said their attendance at noon or evening 
sessions was dependent on their clinical 
schedule. Respondents were split regard-
ing their preference for an indoor or 
outdoor venue, yet most recommended 
including off-campus sessions. Sugges-
tions on ways to improve the sessions in-
cluded more variety in the format (use of 
different multimedia), more prompts, and 
offering the sessions to participants from 
other medical and health care disciplines. 
DISCUSSION
Here we demonstrate the successful 
implementation of a narrative medi-
cine curriculum during internship year 
and summarize the reported benefits to 
participants in an internal medicine resi-
dency program. The intern year is touted 
as the most difficult year in a physician’s 
life. It is characterized by numerous pres-
sures from patients, attending physicians, 
other residents, and interns’ families; an 
exponential learning curve; and a lack of 
time to eat or sleep. The most common 
barriers to implementation of extra-
curricular activity during residency are 
time constraints and a lack of structural 
and cultural support.14 Yet the narrative 
medicine sessions were well attended. 
We attribute this success to two factors. 
First, the sessions took advantage of the 
residents’ protected didactic time (such as 
noon conference) or sessions took place at 
the end of clinical time. If an intern could 
not attend a session, a repeat session was 
offered the following month to ensure 
that both sessions did not fall on the 
same clinical rotation month. Attendance 
was not mandatory, but participation was 
encouraged through morning report and 
e-mail announcements. Second, program 
support was essential to ensure intern 
participation. The narrative medicine 
initiative was promoted by the Program 
Director, who teaches medicine with a fo-
cus on the art of medicine and humanism.
The high survey response rate captured 
interns’ perspectives on narrative medicine. 
Respondents highlighted a lack of alter-
native outlets for stress during residency 
training. The narrative medicine sessions 
provided a forum in which they could talk 
about topics they usually did not discuss 
in their personal or professional relation-
ships. Internship year in internal medicine 
is characterized as relearning medicine as 
an applied science and the pressure of act-
ing as a physician for the very first time, 
which can cause burnout.15,16 Providing 
structured time for reflective writing can 
help residents deal with the clinical de-
mands of the intern year. 
Today’s medical training is shifting 
from listening to patient narratives to-
ward a more mechanical approach to 
care that is focused on quick information 
assessment. Such an approach eliminates 
consideration of a patient’s experience 
from physician training. Narrative medi-
cine involves listening to the intricacies of 
patients’ stories as they unfold and “trans-
lating” subjective words into objective in-
formation to gain a better understanding 
of an illness. Moreover, storytelling often 
is therapeutic for patients and has dem-
onstrated healing effects.3 Storytelling 
also can transform a medical encounter 
into a more empathetic and understand-
ing experience between patients and 
physicians, which enhances the quality of 
care.14 This type of practice helps physi-
cians improve their personal awareness 
and avoid succumbing to the confusion, 
loneliness, depression, and frustration 
that can be associated with caring for 
critically ill patients.10,18 The mindfulness,

NARRATIVE MEDICINE
Implementing a Narrative Medicine Curriculum During the Internship Year: An Internal Medicine Residency Program Experience
themes support previous findings that 
including narrative practice in medical 
training can result in the availability of 
physicians who listen to their patients, 
reflect on their own experiences, and be-
come well-rounded professionals as they 
improve patient-physician, physician-self, 
and physician-colleague relationships. 
This residency program’s small sample 
size was a study limitation. Selection bias 
also was an issue because the interns who 
attended the most sessions were more 
interested in the value of the curriculum. 
Future research endeavors will focus on 
metrics that evaluate the curriculum’s 
impact on residents’ approach to patient 
care. Larger, prospective, and multicenter 
studies in residency programs are needed 
to measure the value of narrative medicine 
in graduate medical education. 
CONCLUSION
An enthusiastic response following 
participation in a narrative medicine cur-
riculum supported our endeavor. These 
results strengthen our belief that narra-
tive medicine, acknowledged as beneficial 
to residents training in this program, will 
continue to gain momentum in the aca-
demic medicine community. v

Thoughts on Sexual Health

ABSTRACT
As a practicing obstetrician/gynecologist for more than 18 
years, I have realized the importance of sexual health as well as 
the embarrassing lack of training in this very important part of our 
patients’ overall mental and physical health. If anyone should be 
expected to be not only comfortable but knowledgeable about sex, 
it should be us. Unfortunately, many of us had little or no education 
in sexual health during medical school or residency. I have been 
on a journey to educate myself so I might better help my patients.
INTRODUCTION
I often find myself sharing with patients how little education 
we, as physicians, get in sexual medicine. And in the specialty 
I chose, obstetrics and gynecology, it’s even more disturbing to 
admit this. As a female physician in my 50s, I have found that 
many of my patients will share their sexual concerns with me—
often whether I directly ask them or not. And it’s embarrassing 
to admit that even as a female obstetrician/gynecologist, I often 
haven’t asked. It wasn’t that I didn’t care or want to know; it was 
that I didn’t feel I knew enough to be able to offer much help. 
But women would share things. They would share that a fam-
ily member molested them as a child. They would share about a 
first sexual experience in which they contracted a sexually trans-
mitted disease and felt “dirty” ever since. Women would tell me 
that “sex was great” for a while, but now they have a job and 2 
kids and have gained 6.75 kg (15 lb) and have been married for 
11 years, and things aren’t “the same” anymore. I’ve seen patients 
whose breast cancer treatments led to premature menopause, 
causing not only body image concerns but also vaginal dryness 
to the point at which sex feels “like sandpaper.” When their 
oncologists told them absolutely no estrogen, I found myself 
empathetic but feeling fairly useless.
I wanted to help. I went into this profession to help women. 
I can deliver a baby; I can do surgery; I can help with irregular 
bleeding and pelvic pain (sometimes!). But there are so many 
factors that are involved in sexual health. And as we all know, 
it takes time. Time we often feel we don’t have to ask and listen 
and learn. It takes time for a patient to trust you. But when a 
patient does get up the courage to share her concerns, how can 
we not offer her something?
EDUCATING MYSELF
Because I didn’t feel very well educated, even as a gyne-
cologist, I started to focus on lectures and conferences that 
addressed these issues. I tried to learn more about menopause 
and perimenopause and vaginal dryness. I did research on 
vulvodynia and vaginismus. The more I learned, the more I 
realized how little I actually knew about the extremely wide 
variety of sexual experiences, attitudes, and practices. 
I began to realize that I inadvertently made assumptions re-
garding sexual preferences. If a woman stated she was married, 
I assumed this meant to a male partner and that she had no 
other partners. The more I learned, the more I asked and tried 
to adjust my questioning to be as open and as unassuming and 
nonjudgmental as possible.
I learned not to act surprised when a woman asked to be 
“tested everywhere” for sexually transmitted infections. I learned 
that sometimes when a woman says, “I don’t have any other 
partners, but I’m not sure about my husband,” this could be true, 
or it could be that she or they both have other partners but she 
doesn’t want to share that they are “swingers” or “polyamorous” 
or “consensual nonmonogamists.” 
I started investigating other sexual practices and lifestyles so 
I could be more aware and less likely to be surprised (or even 
shocked) when a woman shared an intimate detail with me. I 
found myself actually honored when a woman shyly told me her 
partner wanted to try anal intercourse, and she was curious but 
also scared and didn’t know whom to ask about this.
In the process of trying to educate myself, I have met some 
wonderful marriage and family therapists, sex therapists, and 
sex coaches. I have also been unpleasantly enlightened about the 
harm we sometimes do to patients when they are brave enough 
to share their sexual concerns. One therapist I met shared a story 
of her client who had been making great progress in her work 
with vaginismus, until she went to see a gynecologist and was 
told it was just something she would have to “deal with.” I have 
to hope that this physician’s response was based on the fact that 
he didn’t know there are ways to help with this condition, not 
that he didn’t care.
OPENING A DIALOGUE
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists 
(ACOG) recently issued a Committee Opinion stating that 
obstetricians/gynecologists are in a “unique position to open a 
dialogue on sexual health issues.”1 In this opinion, the College 
addresses much of what I’ve been feeling, including “a lack of 
adequate training and confidence in the topic, a perception 
that there are few treatment options, a lack of adequate clinical 
time to obtain a sexual history, patients’ reluctance to initiate 
the conversation, and the underestimation of the prevalence of 
sexual dysfunction.”
I was encouraged that in this report, ACOG acknowledged 
sexual health as an important “element of overall health” and 
also supported the World Health Organization statement that

Thoughts on Sexual Health
sexual health is “a state of physical, emotional, mental and social 
well-being in relation to sexuality; it is not merely the absence 
of disease, dysfunction or infirmity.”2
Additionally, ACOG warns that sexually transmitted in-
fections are on the rise. It quotes the alarming fact that 2015 
was the second year in a row in which the rates of chlamydia, 
gonorrhea, and syphilis have increased. As health care practi-
tioners we may be able to have an impact on this and on related 
health risks (eg, pelvic inflammatory disease, 
ectopic pregnancy, infertility, epididymitis) 
by asking all patients about being tested, 
discussing safer sex practices with everyone, 
and never making the presumption that it 
isn’t necessary.
Primary care physicians are usually aware 
that medical conditions such as diabetes, 
hypertension, thyroid disorders, cancer, and 
depression can have an impact not only on 
a patient’s physical and emotional health but also on his/her 
sexual health. Often, however, we don’t know much about what 
we can do to help, and because of this, we don’t even want to ask.
One technique that is simple but useful is the PLISSIT 
Model3 of giving permission (P) for patients to discuss their 
sexual concerns, providing limited information (LI) and spe-
cific suggestions (SS) to help, and then referring for intensive 
therapy (IT) if needed. 
There are also simple questionnaires such as the Decreased 
Sexual Desire Screener (DSDS), which has 5 yes or no questions. 
If a clinician is interested in going into more depth, there is the 
Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI),4 which has 19 questions 
to which a patient rates her responses from 1 to 5. There is also 
the Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM). These question-
naires, including how to interpret them, are easily found online 
and are free to download and use.
COMMON PATIENT CONCERNS AND TREATMENTS
Decreased sexual desire is the most common concern brought 
up by my patients (and the one we often dread hearing a patient 
bring up as our hand is on the doorknob). There are medica-
tion options now, but for most women it seems to be reassur-
ing when we discuss how very common this is (up to 40% of 
women) and that this is not necessarily a medical problem. 
It may help women to discover that, although they may not 
walk around thinking about sex all the time, if they are able to 
respond to their partner’s advances or an erotic film or image 
or book, they are very normal. We discuss that there may be a 
discrepancy in how often they want or initiate sex as opposed 
to their partner (there is actually a term for this called desire 
discrepancy), and it can help to address all the varied factors that 
come into play (so to speak!). We discuss that sexual motivation 
can be complicated and include many important factors, such as 
their relationship with their partner, the length of time in the 
relationship, children or concerns about getting pregnant or not 
getting pregnant, work/life stress, body image, aging, history of 
abuse, lack of experience, boredom/routine, cultural upbringing, 
religion, medications, hormones, and so on.
Many of my perimenopausal and menopausal patients, and 
sometimes even breastfeeding women and women using oral 
contraception, complain of vulvovaginal pain with vaginal pen-
etration. This is often caused by hypoestrogenic atrophic vaginal 
changes or the “genitourinary syndrome of menopause,”5 which 
can cause vaginal dryness and subsequent pain with penetration 
as well as vaginal itching, burning, and discharge.
I knew to inform women to avoid harsh soaps and deter-
gents, but now I’ve learned about the variety 
of lubricants, including water-based, silicone, 
hybrids, and oil-based. I’ve learned about 
additives or preservatives to avoid, such as 
propylene glycol (often found in antifreeze) 
and chlorhexidine, that can cause burning 
and irritation and, like glycerine or sometimes 
coconut oil, even yeast infections. I knew 
about not using oil-based lubricant with latex 
condoms but have learned that it is acceptable 
with nitrile and polyurethane but not polyisoprene barriers. And 
I’ve discovered that you shouldn’t use silicone lubricants with 
silicone vibrators as they can cause disintegration of the vibra-
tor. I’ve been able to share this information with my patients. 
I also recommend vaginal moisturizers (eg, Luvena, Replens, 
Lubrigyn), which, used on a regular basis, can help improve 
vaginal dryness in some women, especially those who don’t 
want to use vaginal estrogen.6 
Many physicians are still not aware that vaginal estrogen ap-
pears to be more effective than systemic therapy for the treat-
ment of vaginal atrophy. They are also concerned that the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) has applied the black-box 
warning regarding the potential risks of oral and transdermal 
estrogen to vaginal preparations. I talk to women about the 
benefits of vaginal estrogen, including the fact that low-dose 
options such as vaginal estrogen tablets and the vaginal estrogen 
ring have minimal to no systemic absorption of estrogen and, as 
such, appear to carry minimal if any risk. However, the vaginal 
tablets (Yuvafem, Vagifem) and the ring (Estring) sometimes 
do not help enough. They tend to only improve lubrication in 
the upper two-thirds of the vagina. If penetration is painful, 
it’s not enough for the upper two-thirds to be lubricated when 
the lower one-third remains dry and painful. Vaginal estrogen 
cream (Estrace, Premarin) does appear to be slightly more sys-
temically absorbed, but often provides better overall lubrication 
and improvement in vulvovaginal atrophy. 
In 2016, ACOG issued a Committee Opinion regarding the 
use of vaginal estrogen for managing urogenital symptoms in 
women currently undergoing treatment of breast cancer or with 
a personal history of breast cancer.7 ACOG advises that nonhor-
monal approaches are still the recommended first-line choices, 
but that vaginal estrogen could be considered for those patients 
unresponsive to nonhormonal treatment, and that data do not 
show an increased risk of cancer recurrence. I discuss this with 
my patients and suggest they try silicone lubricants and vaginal 
moisturizers first, but let them know vaginal estrogen could be an 
option. For many patients, even before the ACOG opinion, this 
is a quality-of-life issue and an option they are relieved to have. 
Decreased sexual desire 
is the most common 
concern brought up by 
my patients (and the one 
we often dread hearing 
a patient bring up as our 
hand is on the doorknob).

NARRATIVE MEDICINE
Thoughts on Sexual Health
There is now an FDA-approved product for the treatment of 
moderate to severe dyspareunia available for prescribing since 
July 2017.8 It is a daily intravaginal suppository of dehydroepi-
androsterone called prasterone (Intrarosa). It is a prohormone 
that gets converted to local estrogen and testosterone and has 
been demonstrated to improve lubrication; decrease pain at 
sexual activity; and consequently, improve sexual function, 
desire, arousal, orgasm, and satisfaction. Because prasterone is 
not an actual estrogen, it does not have the mandated black-box 
FDA warning that all estrogen products currently must have, 
but there still may be potential concern.
Ospemifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator that 
acts as an estrogen agonist in the vagina, can also address this 
problem. It is a daily, oral medication, approved by the FDA in 
2013 for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia caused 
by vulvovaginal atrophy in menopausal women. It appears to 
have minimal estrogenic effect on the endometrium and breast 
but may cause systemic side effects such as hot flashes and the 
potential increased risk of thromboembolism. This product is 
also contraindicated in women with a prior history of breast 
cancer or in women with an increased risk of thromboembolism. 
The laser devices that are touted as treatments of vulvovaginal 
atrophy are still not FDA approved for this condition, and at 
least currently, there is scant published evidence that this pro-
cedure improves vaginal epithelium and subsequently symptoms 
of atrophy. It is also quite expensive.
Many of us have attempted to examine patients who have 
extreme difficulty tolerating a speculum. I certainly wasn’t taught 
that vaginismus (the marked tensing and tightening of the vagi-
nal muscles) can be voluntary or involuntary when a woman is 
anticipating pain, and that this often develops in response to a 
past painful experience. It can be related to a less-than-optimal 
first sexual experience, a history of abuse, or simply a former 
painful vulvovaginal condition that left the memory in both 
her emotional and physical response. We can even cause this 
condition if a patient has a bad first experience with a pelvic 
examination or Papanicolaou test. 
I sometimes gently joke with my patients and tell them, “Your 
vagina isn’t stupid. It’s trying to protect you.” I work on hav-
ing a patient consciously contract her vaginal muscles while I 
gently place a gloved, lubricated finger at her introitus. I then 
have her intentionally relax those muscles and breathe while I 
gradually and gently insert my finger a little farther. If it’s too 
much, she tells me, and we stop. We repeat this slowly until a 
woman is able to accommodate my finger and later a speculum. 
If that doesn’t work, we start with a small vaginal dilator either 
in the office or at home, again using time and lubrication and 
relaxation techniques and gradually increasing the dilator size 
(see Sidebar: Dilator Resources). This allows women to be in 
control of the situation, alone or with a partner. Because many 
partners are fearful of hurting the woman, it can be comfort-
ing to them to be able to participate in helping her relax and 
start to be able to enjoy intercourse and be comfortable with 
penetration (if this is the goal). It helps, of course, if the patient 
and her partner are motivated and have good communication. 
But this can even help improve communication around sex and 
what feels good and what doesn’t (see Sidebar: Resources for 
Genitourinary-Pelvic Pain Disorders in Women).
Orgasmic dysfunction can be related to a medical condi-
tion or medication, but I have had women share with me that 
they are nonorgasmic (or their male partners have told them 
this) because they never had an orgasm from penile-vaginal 
intercourse. For these women to be reassured that this is quite 
normal and that most women need some type of direct stimu-
lation of the clitoris can be very affirming. It may require open 
discussion with a partner regarding what she enjoys or requires 
to achieve orgasm, or some experimentation with stimulatory 
devices, but often just the knowledge that she is not “abnormal” 
is empowering. 
There are an almost endless variety of vibrators, including 
an erection-enhancing ring for men, which may also contain a 
clitoral stimulation device for a female partner to better provide 
direct clitoral stimulation during penile-vaginal intercourse.
There are also personal care products such as the Fiera, a 
vibrating device that provides vacuum suction to increase cir-
culation to genital tissues and, as such, may help with stimula-
tion, lubrication, and orgasm, and potentially with hypoactive 
desire. It can cost around $200 though, and, if the patient seems 
receptive, I will sometimes try joking that there are other, less 
costly ways to provide suction to the clitoris that may have the 
same effect. However, we certainly must exercise caution, be-
cause it can be very difficult to know a patient’s comfort level

Thoughts on Sexual Health
with various sexual practices or even with the discussion of 
something such as a vibrator or “self-stimulator” (see Sidebar: 
Retail Web Sites).
As an obstetrician/gynecologist, I don’t deal as much with male 
sexual dysfunction, but conditions such as premature ejacula-
tion or erectile dysfunction can certainly have an impact on 
my female patients, their sexual response, and, of course, their 
relationships. In addition to looking at the possible medical and 
psychological causes of these conditions, the distress that this 
may cause both partners must be addressed. 
I believe we should do what we can to open communication 
around the important sexual aspect of our overall health. Patients 
should be able to speak freely to their health care practitioner 
without shame, embarrassment, or the fear of being judged. 
Few of us may currently encounter patients who are lesbian, 
gay, bisexual, transgender, or gender-dysphoric (feeling distress 
that the gender you are born does not match the gender with 
which you identify yourself); or perhaps we do but just don’t 
realize it. In a recent survey, a large percentage of these patients 
stated that they delayed or did not seek medical care as a result 
of discrimination.9 For a homosexual woman or a transgender 
man (a person born female but who self-identifies as male), a 
pelvic examination can be very uncomfortable. Many of these 
patients are nulliparous, and some have had limited or no 
vaginal penetration. Use of relaxation techniques, communica-
tion, sometimes topical lidocaine jelly at the introitus, and the 
smallest, narrowest speculum possible can be helpful during a 
pelvic examination. 
REFERRALS AND RESOURCES
A multifaceted approach can be helpful for many medical 
and psychological conditions as well as sexual disorders or con-
cerns. A qualified physical therapist can be quite helpful in the 
treatment of vaginismus and dyspareunia. Mindfulness-based 
stress reduction, now more commonly called “mindfulness” or 
“being present” focuses on nonjudgmental awareness of one’s 
thoughts, feelings, perceptions, and environment.10 It may help 
improve sexual functioning, as can cognitive behavioral therapy. 
For patients whose issues are too complex to be dealt with 
in ordinary office practice, practitioners or patients can find a 
certified sex counselor or therapist in their area at the American 
Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors and Therapists 
(AASECT) Web site (www.aasect.org). A licensed marriage and 
family therapist can also be helpful, because sexual problems 
can certainly affect a relationship, or conversely, the relationship 
can be part of the reason for a sexual problem. I have found that 
an AASECT-certified therapist is often a very good resource 
for patients dealing with the many interrelated components of 
sexual and relationship issues. The Society for Sex Therapy and 
Research (www.sstarnet.org) can also be helpful for finding a 
reliable and knowledgeable professional (see Sidebar: Informa-
tive Web Sites for Patients and Clinicians).
For patients whom I believe might benefit from reading 
material, I use bibliotherapy (see Sidebar: Bibliotherapy for 
Patients) and printed handouts (eg, on recommended lubricants 
and information regarding the risks and benefits of vaginal 
estrogen) as well as informative and retail Web sites (see Side-
bars: Retail Web Sites and Informative Web Sites for Patients 
and Clinicians).

CONCLUSION
It is refreshing to me that, although I may not have all the 
answers, I can help women by asking and listening, and often 
normalizing their experiences and concerns. There is no shame 
in not knowing all the answers, but there is shame if a woman 
never feels comfortable enough to ask for our help. v

ABSTRACT
In this reflection on being both a 
physician and a patient, I consider the 
events that happened to me as a patient 
with cancer and how this will change my 
practice as a doctor in the future.
INTRODUCTION
Every day in my role as an orthopedic 
trauma surgeon, I deal with people who 
have their lives turned upside down be-
cause of a completely unexpected event. 
Normal life is carrying on when, bang, 
something happens. This event may be 
not seeing a vehicle in a side mirror, an 
unexpected noise spooking a horse, or 
tripping at the top of the stairs. A single 
moment changes everything. All the trials 
and tribulations of normal life are suddenly 
inconsequential. Rapidly the expectations 
of normal life such as being able to work 
and care for themselves, or even their very 
existence, is challenged. The future that they 
had mapped out, whether it be for the next 
few days, weeks, months, or years, is sud-
denly destroyed. 
Physicians see this every day. But as the 
years go by, on call days merge into one, 
and one clinic becomes indistinguishable 
from the next, it is easy to lose touch with 
what our patients are really going through. 
Emotional self-preservation can dimin-
ish empathy. Pattern recognition is vital 
to focused case management, but there is 
a risk that classification leads to a loss of 
individuality and desensitization toward 
our patients. 
It is easy to assume that we are just the 
physicians, the providers of care, and are 
totally separate and immune to this patient 
experience. The process of identifying and 
treating conditions artificially separates us 
from our patients. This allows us to believe 
that the patient experience cannot happen 
to us. We are wrong. 
In April 2017, I was going about my 
normal working day, putting the final 
touches to my afternoon presentation to 
the orthopedic trauma team, and wonder-
ing if I had time to take my 1-year-old 
daughter to buy some new shoes after 
work. I went to a routine follow-up clinic 
appointment, where I was told a biopsy 
from a suspected benign lesion had very 
unexpectedly been identified as probable 
metastatic cancer. My life was suddenly 
blown into a thousand pieces. I am 34 years 
old, have a little girl to look after, and am 
an orthopedic surgeon. This couldn’t be 
happening to me. But it did. 
A LEARNING EXPERIENCE
The several months after my diagnosis 
have been some of the toughest times of 
my life. But I have also learned a huge 
amount about myself, my family, and 
my wonderful colleagues. These past few 
months have been spent in a complex 
network of appointments, scans, surger-
ies, second opinions, conflicting advice, 
and uncertainty. As I now emerge from 
the other side of this fog of bewilderment 
and confusion over what my treatment and 
future might hold, I want to share what I 
have learned and how I will act differently 
after this experience. 
No person exists in isolation. The 
patient in front of you is entwined in a 
network of people and decisions. What 
happens to that patient has implications 
for many other people. Whether it be the 
patient’s ability to look after children or an 
elderly relative, his/her mother who is wor-
ried halfway across the country, the work 
colleague who is about to cancel his/her 
holiday to cover for that person, a patient’s 
health condition can deeply affect a whole 
web of situations. Minor decisions to us as 
physicians can have huge consequences for 
people’s lives and livelihoods. In my role 
as a surgeon, I am now much more careful 
and diligent to ask all my patients about 
their job responsibilities, if they provide a 
caring role for children or elderly people, 
and if there is anything logistically I can 
do to improve the situation. I am much 
more supportive in amending dates and 
timings of clinics and procedures around 
my patients. I now routinely send a copy 
of my notes in a letter to the patient so s/
he can answer questions from family or 
employees. I try to provide a rough esti-
mate for every patient in terms of length 
of hospital stay and likely time to return to 
independence so that the person can plan 
his/her schedule and inform those around 
them with as much notice as possible. As 
physicians, we often talk about patient-
centered care, but I believe that we also 
need to consider the patient in the context 
of his/her place in the complex society in 
which we live. 
As a patient, time moves incredibly 
slowly. Physicians juggle the demands 
of many patients, and it often seems like 
there are not enough hours in the day to 
get everything done. As a patient, with 
only one focus and each decision having 
huge consequences, time drags. It can 
seem incredibly reasonable that we might 
tell a patient that his/her case is going 
to be discussed at the trauma meeting in 
four days’ time, or they need to wait for 
the multidisciplinary team outcome next 
Wednesday. For patients, this time seems 
like a lifetime, and their life is put on hold 
waiting for the result. Obviously, decisions 
and treatment take time, and there is often 
little that can be done to improve this. 
When counseling patients, I now explain 
why this time is needed, detail what steps 
will be involved, and make sure they al-
ways have a point of contact. Most of all, 
I make sure they are contacted as soon as 
a decision has been made. 
I have spent hours, if not days, dur-
ing the past few months waiting for a 
hospital switchboard to answer, leaving 
voice mail and messages on answering 
machines for people who never call back. 
I know the system, how it works, and

who does what. I was glued to my phone 
for months, not knowing when it might 
ring or what snippet of news I might hear 
next. I felt reluctant to put my cell phone 
down or go anywhere with poor reception 
in case someone called and left a number 
I couldn’t make out, or no number—or 
worse—no message at all. I once left my 
phone inside while I took the recycling out, 
and of course, I missed an important call, 
and it took me three hours to get back in 
touch. It wasn’t the caller’s fault; he’s a busy 
person. Many people told me they would 
call me back, and they didn’t. It became an 
ongoing joke to me and my husband: Guess 
what? No one called again! However, one 
nurse specialist always called back the next 
workday, or her colleagues would. And if I 
didn’t answer, she left me a message say-
ing who it was, when she was available to 
answer the phone, and when she would try 
again. I can’t tell you what a difference that 
made to me. Previously, I would not have 
even considered that this information and 
reliability would be important, but to me 
it was amazing. Now when I call a patient 
or patient’s family member, I always leave a 
message and contact details and try again in 
half an hour. I respond to every e-mail ask-
ing me to call a patient as quickly as I can, 
and if there is going to be a delay, I write a 
quick note, so the patient can be informed 
when to expect my call.
There is a huge amount of work that goes 
on in the hospital that as a patient you don’t 
see, hear about, or even realize exists. As a 
more informed patient, I realized what a 
fundamental role these hospital staff play. 
The support “specialties” play a huge role in 
patient care but can so easily be overlooked 
by the patient. Where would orthopedic 
surgeons be without any imaging, specialist 
scan reports, blood test results, or a secre-
tary? For me, the pathologist has played a 
crucial role during my cancer diagnosis. The 
surgeon provides the tissue, but it is the 
pathologists who find out what the prob-
lem might be. Their knowledge of special 
staining, receptor status, and diligence over 
finding tumor margins have determined my 
treatment more than anything. I’ve sent my 
pathologist a thank-you card. I’m not sure 
many pathologists receive thank-you cards. 
But she made a huge difference to me, and I 
wanted her to know. It is easy as the front-
line physician to receive the praise and the 
thanks, but this experience has humbled me 
in realizing we are perhaps a smaller cog in 
the wheel than we sometimes think. 
Hospitals can be frightening places, es-
pecially operating rooms. At work, I try to 
spend as much time as possible operating. 
I know how it works, how many thousands 
of operations go well, and how safe it is. As 
I shuffled into the anesthetic room wear-
ing my fetching antiembolism compression 
stockings, I was scared. However irrational 
it is, there is something about handing over 
control of your body to someone else that 
will always be terrifying. Before I went into 
surgery, my wonderful surgeon bent down 
and looked me in the eye. She told me she 
would look after me. Her reassurance and 
the smiles and professionalism of all the 
operating room staff made such a huge dif-
ference to me. In a busy operating day, it’s 
easy to lose patience and become irritated 
at minor inconveniences. I have changed 
my attitude to contact with patients on the 
day of surgery. I now focus on explanation 
and reassurance. The first thing I do now 
when I’ve finished an operation is find the 
family member in the waiting room. Dic-
tating the operation note can wait. At the 
end of the operating day to-do list, I sit 
down with each patient, explain how the 
operation went, and what will happen now. 
I will never forget how important smiles 
and reassurance were to me. 
I have spent hours sitting in different 
waiting rooms. Once my husband and I 
had been waiting so long that we ended 
up playing a game of “If you were on a 
desert island and could only have 3 items, 
which would you choose?” In the oncology 
waiting rooms, there is a certain under-
standing among the patients. People there 
don’t talk to each other (that would be very 
un-British!), but I have observed reassur-
ing smiles among my fellow patients. It is 
easy to spot the person who is frightened 
and often tearful at the beginning of his/
her cancer journey. As my husband and 
I entered one oncology clinic for the 
first time, it was obvious that I was the 
youngest person there by about 20 years. 
The pity and sympathy on many people’s 
faces initially made me upset, but actually 
this reaction was from a group of people 
who knew what I was going through. It is 
amazing that in a group of patients, there 
is enough empathy for the other people 
around them. Seeing another patient 
exiting a consultation room desperately 
upset and knowing that person didn’t hear 
the news that s/he wanted to can have a 
palpable effect in a waiting room. Patients 
get support from a variety of places, and 
I have begun to recognize and appreciate 
this more. Specialist nurses, charities, and 
patient support groups can all be there for 
our patients when we are not, and advertis-
ing these services to patients from an early 
stage can provide a huge benefit to them.
CONCLUSION
In the end, I didn’t have metastatic 
cancer, but rather a rare primary tumor, 
which has been completely excised. I feel 
I have been incredibly lucky. Perhaps we 
forget for our own emotional protection 
and to survive in the jobs that we do, but 
it is worth remembering that our patients 
could be us. Stepping back from our role 
as a physician and seeing things from the 
patient’s perspective is something all phy-
sicians should do from time to time. That 
reassuring smile, the extra time explain-
ing something again, or the return phone 
call all make a difference. As I pass the 
oncology center on my way into work, I 
often look up to the building in which I 
was treated. I remember the kindness and 
dedication of the people who treated me. 
I also think of those people I met along 
the way whose journeys did not have such 
a happy ending. I hope my experience 
makes me a better and more compassion-
ate physician. v

The
Birch Lake  
photograph 
By Shenshen Dou, MS
Nature not only 
nurtures us, it eases 
our pain and heals our 
soul. This is a work 
from the artist’s “Man 
in Nature” photography 
art serial. In this image a girl playfully walks along a 
flowered trail beside a lake. The blurry reflection of the 
birch trees in the lake helps to fashion an illusory feel. 
Ms Dou worked as a molecular biologist and is an artist 
living in West Linn, OR. More of her work can be found

ORIGINAL RESEARCH

 4 Low Cancer Risk of South Asians:  
A Brief Report. H Nicole Tran, MD, PhD; 
Natalia Udaltsova, PhD; Yan Li, MD, PhD; 
Arthur L Klatsky, MD
Logistic regression models were used to 
study cancer mortality through 2012 in 
273,843 persons (1117 South Asians: India, 
Pakistan, Bangladesh, or Sri Lanka) with 
baseline examination data from 1964-1985. 
Death was attributed to cancer in 28,031 
persons (1555 Asians, including 32 South 
Asians). The all-Asian vs white adjusted 
odds ratio was 1.0, and the South Asian vs 
white odds ratio was 0.5. In separate regres-
sions, South Asians were at lower risk than 
blacks, Chinese, Filipinos, Japanese, or 
other Asians. The South Asian-white dispar-
ity was concentrated in men.
 9 Does a Relationship Exist Between 
Lower Body Power and Balance  
Scores Among Older Adults? 
Andrew Shim, EdD; Brady Harr, MS;  
Mike Waller, PhD
Falls are the second-leading cause of 
unintentional injury and death worldwide. 
All participants (13) were assessed stability 
scores via computerized posturography to 
determine center of pressure and limits of 
stability (LoS) balance scores. Participants 
stood on a perturbed surface with their eyes 
open and closed. Muscle power output and 
LoS scores have moderate to strong corre-
lations with balance scores in older adults.
 13 Nerve Transfer Surgery for  
Penetrating Upper Extremity Injuries. 
Efstathios Karamanos, MD; Ilya Rakitin, MD; 
Sophie Dream, MD; Aamir Siddiqui, MD
The authors included cases (16 males, 
age 16-43 years) performed since 2006 
to repair penetrating trauma of upper 
extremities within 3 months of injury 
with at least 3 years’ of follow-up. Six 
patients underwent nerve transfer sur-
gery because of elbow flexion; 5, finger 
extension; 3, finger flexion; and 2, wrist 
pronation. Nine patients had associated 
vascular injury, and 4 had fractures. All 
patients improved from 0 of 5 muscle 
strength preoperatively to a mean of 3.8 
within 1 year after surgery, and in all 
cases strength was maintained.
 17 Effects of Treatment-Associated 
Increases in Fruit and Vegetable Intake 
on the Consumption of Other Food 
Groups and Weight Through Self-
Regulatory Processes. 
James J Annesi, PhD, FAAHB, FTOS, FAPA
Women with obesity (N = 74, mean age 
= 47.7 years) participating in a yearlong 
behavioral weight-loss treatment plan 
were assessed regarding changes in 
consumption of various food groups, 
physical activity, and eating self-regulation. 
Fruits and vegetables (FV) intake change 
significantly predicted changes in weight 
and consumption of dairy and bread 
products and sweets. The only other 
notable relationships were among changes 
in sweets, bread, and dairy consumption 
over 24 months. During 6, 12, and 24 
months, changes in self-regulation 
significantly mediated the FV intake-
weight change relationship. A reciprocal 
relationship between changes in FV intake 
and self-regulation also was found.
 21 Association of Psychiatric Diagnostic 
Conditions with Hospital Care Outcomes 
of Patients with Orthopedic Injuries 
Steven Schwartz, MD; Shahrzad 
Bazargan-Hejazi, PhD; Deyu Pan, MS; 
David Ruiz, MD; Anaheed Shirazi, MD; 
Eleby Washington, MD
This retrospective cohort study included 
108 patients with malignant melanoma 
treated with an anti-PD-1 checkpoint 
inhibitor from August 2014 through 
December 2015. The median time 
from initiating therapy to the end of 
follow-up was 118 days. For patients 
with metastatic melanoma treated with 
nivolumab or pembro-lizumab, higher 
neutrophil or platelet counts, or lower 
lymphocyte counts, are associated 
with higher risk of progression. The 
authors recommend more frequent 
assessment for progression and closer 
follow-up, especially for patients with 
substantial comorbidities or poor physical 
performance.
 27 Barriers and Facilitators to the 
Deprescribing of Nonbenzodiazepine 
Sedative Medications Among Older 
Adults. Jennifer Kuntz, PhD; Louis Kouch, 
PharmD; Daniel Christian, PharmD; 
Preston L Peterson, MD; Inga Gruss, PhD
From the perspectives of patients, the 
greatest challenges to deprescribing are 
factors related to their insomnia; health 
care system factors, including a desire 
for personalized approaches to care; and 
their own positive personal experiences 
with sedative medication use. From the 
clinician perspective, a lack of institutional 
structures and resources to support 
deprescribing, the attitudes and practices 
of previous clinicians, and patient-related 
factors such as dependence and a lack 
of alternatives to treat insomnia were the 
most important barriers to deprescribing.
