The type and potency of an immune response provoked during vaccination will determine ultimate success in
disease prevention. The basis for this response will be the design and implementation of antigen presentation
to the immune system. Whereas direct antigen administration will elicit some form of immunological response,
a more sophisticated approach would couple the antigen of interest to a vector capable of broad delivery
formats and designed for heightened response. New antigens associated with pneumococcal disease virulence
were used to test the delivery and adjuvant capabilities of a hybrid biological-biomaterial vector consisting of a
bacterial core electrostatically coated with a cationic polymer. The hybrid design provides (i) passive and active
targeting of antigen-presenting cells, (ii) natural and multicomponent adjuvant properties, (iii) dual intracellular
delivery mechanisms, and (iv) a simple formulation mechanism. In addition, the hybrid format enables device-specific,
or in situ, antigen production and consolidation via localization within the bacterial component of the vector. This
capability eliminates the need for dedicated antigen production and purification before vaccination efforts
while leveraging the aforementioned features of the overall delivery device. We present the first disease-
specific utilization of the vector toward pneumococcal disease highlighted by improved immune responses and
protective capabilities when tested against traditional vaccine formulations and a range of clinically relevant
Streptococcus pneumoniae strains. More broadly, the results point to similar levels of success with other diseases
that would benefit from the production, delivery, and efficacy capabilities offered by the hybrid vector.
INTRODUCTION
Vaccination has proven a powerful approach to infectious diseases
predicated on the identification of antigen targets (1). Identifying these
targets is one obstacle to vaccination success, with an equally important
consideration being the effectiveness of antigen production and deliv-
ery. Starting from the base scenario of direct antigen administration,
delivery technology can be designed to enhance and influence the asso-
ciated immune response. For example, a protein antigen administered
with an adjuvant such as alum would represent a classic vaccine formula-
tion and would similarly be expected to initiate a predominantly humoral
or antibody-based immune response, whereas delivery technology would
offer the potential to provide a built-in adjuvant feature as well as variation
in the antigen format and the corresponding immune response (2).
In particular, this study features a hybrid antigen delivery vector com-
posed of biological and biomaterial components, each designed to facil-
itate, enhance, and direct the immune response process (Fig. 1) (3). The
biological portion of the vector is a bacterial cell (nonpathogenic
Escherichia coli) that, as a result of the microbial framework, has natural
adjuvant properties (for example, cell wall containing lipopolysaccharide)
and also allows the delivery of either protein or genetic antigens. A
simple one-step electrostatic-based coating of the bacterial core with
a poly(b-amino ester) (PBAE) covalently linked to mannose provides a
combined delivery device with properties to assist antigen cargo cellular
translocation (4). Namely, the size of the overall vector (~2 mm) allows
passive targeting of phagocytic antigen-presenting cells (APCs) pro-
grammed to engulf such particles; in addition, the vector’s composition
and the surface characteristics endowed by the mannosylated PBAE will
engage APC receptors and enhance uptake upon vector administration
(3, 4). The biomaterial and biological components can also be designed
to facilitate endosomal escape and cytosolic trafficking after phagocy-
tosis. Finally, the bacterial core of the vector allows antigen cargo to be
delivered as protein, nucleic acid, or both.
This last feature also provides an opportunity to directly generate
and maintain the required antigen in lieu of a dedicated bioprocess to
produce genetic or protein formats. Thus, the hybrid vector provides
the added capability of “in situ” antigen production that can be coupled
to the delivery features of the device. Combined, the vector offers a
broad array of engineering opportunities to improve vaccine produc-
tion (via rapid and scalable component generation, in situ antigen pro-
vision, and simple hybrid formulation) and potency (via the innate
design and diverse engineering tools, that is, polymer chemistry and
molecular biology).

 This premise is the basis for the following results. Within the
framework of pneumococcal disease, new antigens were generated
and delivered via the hybrid vector. We obtained directed, broad,
and potent results as assessed within disease challenge assays against a
range of clinically relevant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains. Beyond
the protection data collected for this particular disease type, the vector
format offers opportunities for other maladies (such as cancer or viral-
based infectious disease) similarly expected to require an advanced
delivery device capable of supporting a similarly advanced immune
response.
RESULTS
Hybrid vector assessment with model and novel
antigen delivery
The data presented in this study marks the first application of the hybrid
vector, and the utility of the device is assessed in the context of pneu-
mococcal disease, which afflicts millions worldwide annually, especially
resource-limited children and the elderly (5–7). Initialexperimentswere
dedicated to optimizing and characterizing the use of the hybrid vector
when incorporating a model protein antigen for pneumococcal disease,
that is, pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) (8, 9); the results dem-
onstrate improved outcomes when compared to traditional vaccine for-
mulations containing either alum or complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA;
Fig. 2, A to C). Specifically, both time to death extension and antibody
responses are improved when using the hybrid vector to deliver PspA.
These results were consistent across three different administration
routes (intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, and intranasal), implying a gen-
erality and flexibility toward different means of vaccination. The hybrid
vector allowed for a reduced amount of PspA to be delivered (5 to 15 mg
of PspA with traditional adjuvants versus ~0.007 to 0.7 mg of PspA with
the hybrid vector), with the resulting improvements to immune re-
sponse outcomes indicating the effectiveness of the vector in antigen
delivery and dose sparing. There was also a balanced antibody response
(Fig. 2D) with a transition over time to enhanced immunoglobulin G
(IgG) content for intraperitoneal and subcutaneous administrations
and IgG and IgA content for intranasal administration.
Dosing levels of the hybrid vector containing PspA were also as-
sessed and optimized across administration routes and in response to
S. pneumoniae sepsis challenge using a D39 strain (fig. S1). D39 was
selected because of its notable virulence profile and the fact that it is
one of the harshestpreclinicalchallenge strains. Increasing the challenge
inocula of S. pneumoniae can be countered with increasing hybrid
vector vaccination doses (fig. S1A); however, particularly aggressive
challenge levels [106 S. pneumoniae colony-forming units (CFU)] re-
quire a vaccination dose of ≥1010 hybrid devices to mediate full protec-
tion. Because of the bacterial content of the hybrid vector, it is important
to assess these enhanced dose levels for associated toxicity. Across ad-
ministration routes, toxicity was not observed until ≥1013 hybrid vec-
tors were administered (fig. S1B). However, the design of the hybrid
vector allows both the chemical and biological aspects of the device
to extend dosing level safety. Namely, the vector’s polymer coating
and the inclusion of a lysis E (LyE) gene provide alternative mechan-
isms of attenuation (3, 10). In the case of LyE, the membrane perfora-
tive activity of this protein affords safety of up to 1020 dose levels for the
resulting hybrid device (fig. S1B). Given the added tissue sensitivity as-
sociated with intranasal administration, histology was performed with
1013 hybrid devices. This administration dose was selected because it
was the highest delivery load with no associated toxicity. In support
of the mouse subject viability tests in fig. S1B, no tissue damage was
observed via histological analysis as compared to the untreated control
(fig. S2).
The hybrid vector was then used to screen several antigen candi-
dates selected due to enhanced expression during S. pneumoniae viru-
lence transition during the course of pneumococcal disease progression
(table S1) (11). As such, the antigens would serve as the basis of a “smart”
vaccine capable of directing a subsequent immune response to only a
virulent subset of S. pneumoniae cells (Fig. 3A). Figure 3B presents
the degree of protection provided by protein antigen candidates StkP,
DexB, GlpO, and PncO relative to PspA, with each individually de-
livered via the hybrid vector. Although individual protection varied
by antigen, the design parameters of the hybrid vector allowed con-
solidated testing of all the candidates. Specifically, a dual expression
plasmid system (pCJ10 and pLF; tables S2 and S3 and fig. S3) was used
to enable the vector-based in situ production of the antigen products
while leveraging the delivery capabilities of the hybrid device. Using
the two-plasmid system, we provided complete protection against the
S. pneumoniae challenge strain D39 in both sepsis and pneumonia
mouse models (Fig. 3, C and D).

 To demonstrate the potency and versatility of the hybrid vector two-
plasmid system, we varied challenge levels and strains of S. pneumoniae
within vaccine protection assays. Challenge with strain D39 was tested
up to 1010 CFU (fig. S4), with strong protection (>80% survival) ob-
served for the 107 level and varying degrees of protection provided be-
yond this level across administration routes. Protection conferred on
these advanced challenge levels is considered impressive and highlights
the combined adjuvant, delivery, and antigen consolidation capabilities
of the hybrid vector. Furthermore, as supported by the data of fig. S1,
even better levels of protection would be expected with increased doses
of the hybrid vector, readily possible as a result of engineering the degree
of vector attenuation. Finally, to further assess the protective capabilities
of the antigens delivered with the hybrid vector, we tested vaccination
against an extended panel of S. pneumoniae strains representing diverse
serotypes notably difficult to protect against using current vaccine formu-
lations; complete protection and reduced bacterial burden were observed
(Fig. 3, E and F, and fig. S5).
Directed protection and expanded strain coverage
The directed nature of the vaccination strategy was tested first by com-
paring vaccinated and nonvaccinated mice subjects challenged with
avirulent and virulent S. pneumoniae strains (Fig. 4A). In these expe-
riments, S. pneumoniae strain EF3030 was used because of planktonic
(or broth cultured) cells demonstrating an avirulent phenotype,
whereas those cells released from in vitro or in vivo biofilms are virulent
and cause disease (12, 13). The avirulent strains are cleared either with or
without vaccination, whereas only vaccinated mice are capable of de-
monstrating virulent bacterial clearance over time. This effect is further
tested in the context of S. pneumoniae colonization followed by the ad-
dition of an in vivo virulence trigger (that is, administration of IAV).

 Designed to more closely mimic the common clinical setting where
influenza spurs pneumonia development (13–15), bacterial dissem-
ination, as indicated by the results, is significantly reduced over time,
in line with the theme of the immune response targeting only viru-
lent populations, whereas complete protection is maintained with the
consolidated set of antigens tested (Fig. 4, B to D).
The consolidated aspect of the vaccine formulation also offers ex-
tended protection. Namely, the conserved nature of the individual anti-
gens (table S1), when presented in combination, provides the potential
to cover a broad range of S. pneumoniae strains (table S4). Challenge as-
says were therefore tested with a series of 10 additional S. pneumoniae
strains, withenhanced protection observed in all cases and complete pro-
tection provided in six cases (Fig. 4E).
Predicting protection potential
Although the data presented support the broad protection potential of
the consolidated antigens generated and delivered within the hybrid
vector, the mutational potential of individual and combined antigens
was predicted to further assess widespread and extended utilization of
the vaccination strategy (fig. S6). The results emphasize the cumulative
resistance of the combined antigen vaccination strategy to mutation.
Together, using five antigens specific to virulence provides ample

 coverage and resistance to strain evasion. Thus, antigenic drift (as a
result of innate S. pneumoniae mutation) and the associated threat
to vaccine efficacy are minimized through consolidation.
DISCUSSION
The hybrid vector was designed at one level to assist the intracellular
delivery of antigen cargo to APCs. As a combination of biomaterial
and biological components, each of which was chosen because of indi-
vidual use as delivery vehicles, the combined vector allows synergis-
tic delivery mechanisms and disparate engineering tools to influence
the process of antigen transport. Thus, the steps associated with APC
targeting, uptake, activation, and intracellular antigen release have been
designed through a combination of the two components of the hybrid
device. Highlighting the dual engineering capabilities of the hybrid
vector are the polymer chemistry steps used to conjugate a mannose
ligand to the PBAE shell of the device, which aids in APC targeting
and vector uptake. Similarly, expression and localization of the LyE pro-
tein to the bacterial component of the hybrid vector safely extend the
dose limits of the device.
Here, however, a different aspect of the vector is also highlighted,
namely, the option for in situ antigen generation. The biological core
of the vector allows the molecular biology tools associated with a facile
microbe like E. coli to be used in both antigen consolidation and in-
ternal expression before delivery. This capability makes the normal
requirement of separate bioprocesses dedicated to antigen generation
and purification unnecessary and allows a “one-pot” production and
delivery device for vaccine applications. Future opportunities include a
greatly extended capability for antigen diversity and valency by further
leveraging the molecular biology and recombinant tools available to
E. coli, including the option of extensive operons capable of coordi-
nately expressing >20 genes (16). Similarly, robust bioreactor protocols
and one-step polymer synthesis and vector formation support the
prospect of a scalable and rapid route to vaccine products in response
to emerging pandemic infectious disease demands.
The hybrid vector design also offers options associated with stable
storage and widespread distribution; however, features related to pro-
duction and access are targets of future research. Here, the results il-
lustrate the first directed application of the vector, tested in the context
of pneumococcal disease. The hybrid vector demonstrated improved
immune response metrics using a model protein antigen (PspA) when
compared to traditional vaccine formulations with alum and CFA. Once
the molecular biology tools of the vector were used to consolidate newly
identified antigens, protection was provided across a range of clinically
relevant S. pneumoniae strains and disease models.
The antigens selected for consolidation to the hybrid vector are
based on those up-regulated during virulent transition; thus, the ob-
jective is to target the disease-causing subset from a greater population
of colonizing and asymptomatic S. pneumoniae cells. This capability was
observed across different pneumococci strains, administration routes,
and in vivo conditions, including disease onset triggered by influenza.
Furthermore, the effectiveness of the antigens delivered with the hybrid
vector resulted in protection extended to 10 additional S. pneumoniae
strains. Although not all levels of protection were the same, complete
protection was observed in 11 of 15 cases, emphasizing the broad cov-
erage potential of the consolidated antigens tested in this study. Owing
to the tools associated with the hybrid vector, even broader coverage can
be expected upon the consolidation of additional virulence-associated
antigens into the vector design. This feature, coupled with the conserved
nature of the antigens identified and tested (fig. S6 and table S1), offers
an excellent prospect of combating antigenic drift and the resulting re-
duction in vaccine efficacy. These concerns currently plague various vac-
cines associated with this and other diseases (17). Thus, the conserved
nature of the antigens selected and consolidation options provided
through the hybrid vector offer a solution to this issue.
Countering the capabilities offered by the hybrid design is the
potential for toxicity, given the bacterial nature of the vector’s core and
the cationic charge of the polymer coating. However, an attempt to mit-
igate this issue was made in selecting the starting components, both of
which were chosen because of nontoxic or nonpathogenic aspects. As
demonstrated, the final vector provides attenuation through cellular en-
gineeringofthebacterialcoreandviatheprocessofpolymercoating.The
vector has not provoked any toxicity upon administration unless
heightened doses are used. Yet, even under enhanced dose levels, it
is possible to negate toxic effects due to the biological attenuation
afforded by the LyE gene, providing another level of engineering design
in applying the hybrid vector.
In summary, this study presents the first disease-specific application
of a hybrid biological-biomaterial vector designed to enhance the
cellular elements of an immune response upon administration. Consol-
idating virulent-specific antigens to the hybrid device also offers a smart
vaccine with built-in antigen production or an in situ means of cargo
generation. Combined, the vector offers engineering elements that
range from process-level scalability and distribution to cellular-level im-
mune response tunability, with the potential to be directed at a number
of challenging vaccine opportunities beyond pneumococcal disease.

dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (≥99.7%) were purchased from Fisher
Chemical. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was purchased from Life
Technologies. All remaining chemicals and reagents were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich.
Polymer synthesis
The polymer used in this study, D4A4-Man, was synthesized in a four-
step reaction as previously described (fig. S7) (3, 4, 18, 19). Briefly, in
step 1, allyl-a-D-mannopyranoside (ADM) was synthesized by dissolv-
ing 3 g of D(+)-mannose and 18 mg of p-toluenesulfonyl chloride in
allyl alcohol (20 ml) at 90°C under reflux for 24 hours. The resulting
reaction solution was concentrated by vacuum distillation at 35°C.
Next, in step 2, acrylate-terminated D4A4 was synthesized in DMSO
at a 1:1.2 amine/diacrylate molar ratio for 5 days at 60°C with continuous
stirring at 1000 rpm. Acrylate-terminated polymers were purified by
dialysis followed by evaporation under vacuum. Dialysis procedures
were conducted against acetone using molecular porous membrane
tubing (Spectra/Por Dialysis Membrane, Spectrum Laboratories Inc.),
with an approximate molecular weight cutoff of 3500 daltons. In step
3, acrylate-terminated D4A4 was reacted with excess ethylenediamine
to amine-cap the terminal ends (D4A4-EDA). Specifically, acrylate-
terminated D4A4 was dissolved in DMSO (167 mg/ml) and reacted
with 5 M ethylenediamine (in DMSO) at room temperature for 24 hours.
D4A4-EDA was purified by dialysis followed by evaporation under
vacuum.Inthelaststep,D4A4-EDAwasreactedwithADMata1:2molar
ratio in DMSO at 90°C for 24 hours and then purified via dialysis. Struc-
tureand purity of D4A4-Manwere confirmed using 1H nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy (fig. S7).
Bacterial strains and plasmid generation
Antigen genes were amplified from the genomic DNA of S. pneumoniae
strains using primers summarized in table S2. Each polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) product was cloned into pET expression plasmids using
the flanking restriction sites indicated (designed within the primers).
Constructs were verified by colony PCR and restriction digest analysis
and were then chemically transformed into the BL21(DE3) E. coli cell
line (Novagen). Resulting single-colony transformants were cultured in
3 ml of lysogeny broth (LB) at 37°C with shaking before 15% glycerol
stock storage at −80°C. Plasmid selection antibiotics were used as
needed during bacterial culture within LB medium. Expression was
confirmed by 3 to 5 ml of LB cultures started from glycerol stocks and
grown at 37°C with shaking until an OD600 of 0.4 was achieved. After
which, cultures were induced with isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG) (1mM)for1hour. Uponcollection viacentrifugation,cellswere

boiling with loading dye and expression analysis or confirmation via
SDS–polyacrylamidegelelectrophoresis(SDS-PAGE).PlasmidpUAB055
was used to express and clone the pspA gene (20).
To use the two-plasmid system, pCJ10 was used in conjunction with
a plasmid containing pspA, dexB, stkP, and glpO. The consolidated plas-
mid was assembled by subcloning each respective gene into a pACYC-
Duet-1 plasmid (fig. S3 and table S3). To construct pLF, the restriction
enzymes or sites were used for the corresponding multiple cloning sites
within pACYCDuet-1. Plasmids were chemically transformed into the
E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (as the basis for hybrid device preparation),
and resulting transformants were prepared and stored as glycerol stocks.
Hybrid device preparation
Bacterial and hybrid vectors were prepared from bacterial cultures in-
oculated at 2% (v/v) from overnight starter cultures. Following incuba-
tion at 37°C with shaking until OD600 of 0.4 to 0.5, samples were
induced with 0.1 mM IPTG at 30°C for 3 hours. Bacterial vectors were
then washed once and standardized to OD600 of 0.5 in PBS, whereas
bacteria to be used in hybrid vector formation were washed once and
standardized to OD600 of 1.0 in 25 mM NaOAc (pH 5.15). Polymer
was dissolved in chloroform, desiccated, and resuspended at 1 mg/ml in
25 mM NaOAc (pH 5.15) before it was added in an equal volume to
bacteria and mixed by vortexing on a setting of 5 (Analog Vortex Mixer,
Fisher Scientific) for 10 s. Polymer/bacteria self-assembly was allowed to
continue for 15 min, and devices were then diluted in PBS. Scanning
electron microscopy of the hybrid vectors was performed as described
previously (3).
Hybrid vaccine immunization
Outbred 6-week-old female CD-1 mice (Harlan Laboratories) were
used in immunization experiments. Mice were immunized by intra-
peritoneal injection (200 ml), subcutaneous injection (200 ml), and intra-
nasal aspiration (40 ml) using isoflurane; unless indicated otherwise, 107
hybrid vectors were used in vaccination experiments. Immunization of
controls included sham (PBS; all samples were prepared in PBS as the
background solution), PspA plus alum, and PspA plus CFA, which was
replaced with incomplete Freund’s adjuvant during booster immuniza-
tions (adjuvants were added per the manufacturer’s instructions). If not
indicated otherwise, mice were immunized via subcutaneous injection.
After 14 days, mice were boosted with the same formulations, except in
the case of the CFA adjuvant as described previously. At days 14 and 21,
samples were collected by retro-orbital bleeding and clarified by centrif-
ugation to collect serum. SDS-PAGE expression analysis and densi-
tometry assessment (ImageJ; https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) were completed
(relative to PspA standards and subtracting the expression profile from
a background sample) to quantify PspA levels per dose of hybrid vector,
resulting in ~0.007 and 0.7 mg of PspA delivered with105 and 107 hybrid
vectors, respectively.
S. pneumoniae bacterial preparation and biofilm release
S. pneumoniae strains used in this study are listed in table S4 and were
initially grown on Todd-Hewitt agar plates supplemented with 0.5%
yeast extract and 5% sheep blood and incubated overnight at 37°C.
Single colonies were used to inoculate 5 ml of Todd-Hewitt broth con-
taining 0.5% yeast extract and incubated at 37°C to an OD600 of 0.6. At
this point, S. pneumoniae strains used for challenge studies were washed
once with and resuspended in PBS. NCI-H292 epithelial cells were
cultured in RPMI 1640 medium in T75 flasks at 37°C and 5% CO2. Af-
ter reaching 100% confluency, H292 cells were prefixed in 4% buffered
paraformaldehyde at 34°C for 48 hours followed by three washes with
PBS. CDM-grown pneumococci were then seeded onto fixed H292
cells, with change of media occurring every 12 hours. Formed biofilms
were exposed to heat (38.5°C) for 4 hours, and released cells were then
collected by centrifugation, washed and resuspended in PBS, and quan-
tified by OD600 measurement. Strains presented in table S4 are a mix of
mouse-passaged strains, which directly confer virulence on culture and
administration, and clinical isolates, which usually do not cause disease
upon direct administration and require heat release from the in vitro
biofilm model (previously discussed in detail) to render a virulent
phenotype.

 Challenge models
To induce sepsis or pneumonia, mice were administered intraperitoneally
or intranasally (with isoflurane), respectively, with 1 × 104 to 1 × 1010
CFU of pneumococci strains (table S4). To induce colonization, mice
were administered 1 × 106 CFU, intranasally, without isoflurane. To
mimic influenza-induced pneumonia, pneumococci colonization was
followed by intranasal inoculation with 40 plaque-forming units of IAV.
The mouse-adapted IAV strain A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) (ATCC VR-95) was
used,andtitersweredeterminedbyplaqueassays.Mice were monitored
every 4 hours for signs of morbidity (huddling, ruffled fur, lethargy,
and abdominal surface temperature). Mice found to be moribund were
euthanized via CO2 asphyxiation and cervical dislocation.
Tissue bacterial count
At predefined time points (24 and 48 hours after infection for intra-
peritoneal and intranasal challenges, respectively) or upon becoming
moribund, mice were euthanized (as described previously), and a com-
bination of nasopharynx tissue, nasopharyngeal lavage fluid, lung, liver,
spleen, and blood samples was collected and assessed for bacterial bur-
den, as described by Tyx et al. (21). Briefly, tissue and organ samples,
lavage fluid, and blood were homogenized (on a setting of 10 for 30 s or
until homogenized completely; Tissue-Tearor, BioSpec Products Inc.)
to ensure dissociation of bacterial aggregates and then were serially di-
luted on tryptic soy and 5% blood agar plates before enumeration.
Histologic analysis
Following induction of isoflurane anesthesia, a midline abdominal in-
cision was made, and the abdominal aorta was transected to exsangui-
nate and euthanize the animal. A midline incision was continued
throughthe thoracic cavity andneckto allow injection of 5 ml of normal
saline into the right ventricle of the heart to flush the pulmonary vas-
culature of residual blood. A luer lock–hubbed 20-gauge × ½-inch can-
nula was inserted into the trachea and secured in place with a suture.
The lungs were fixed by insufflation with 10% neutral buffered formalin
at 20 cm H2O for 24 hours at room temperature. The lung lobes were
removed and embedded in paraffin, and 5-mm tissue slices were
prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin by standard histo-
pathology techniques (22). Histology images were acquired with an
Aperio ScanScope CS slide scanner (Leica Biosystems) using a 40×
objective lens and subsequently analyzed using Aperio ImageScope
software version 12.3 (Leica Biosystems).
Antibody analysis
To characterize antibody titers associated with delivery optimization,
an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed by coating a
96-well Costar high-binding polystyrene plate with PspA (10 mg/ml) in
tris-buffered saline (TBS) at 4°C overnight. The plate was blocked with
3% bovine serum albumin in TBS–Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 1 hour at 22°C.
Sera was diluted into TBS-T in ratios of 1:1000, 1:5000, 1:7500, and
1:10,000 and added to the plate. The plates were then incubated at
37°C with mild agitation for 3 hours. The secondary antibody [anti-
mouse IgG, IgA, IgM (H + L), IgE, highly X-adsorbed (biotin)] was
added to the wells in a 1:1000 ratio and agitated for 2 hours. Strep-
tavidin was added to each well in a 1:1000 ratio and allowed to shake
for 30 min. The signal was developed with p-nitrophenylphosphate,
and the reaction was quenched using 0.75 M NaOH. The signal
was detected using a plate reader spectrophotometer at an absorbance
of 405 nm.
Statistical analysis
Column comparisons were analyzed for statistical significance using a
two-tailed Student’s t test for unpaired data. Multivariance analysis was
done using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) that was corrected
using the Bartlett’s variance test, and formultiple comparisons, the Bon-
ferroni multiple-comparison test was used. For both tests, a P value of
0.05 was considered significant. Statistical analysis was performed using
the GraphPad Prism software (version 6.0h.283; GraphPad Software Inc.).
