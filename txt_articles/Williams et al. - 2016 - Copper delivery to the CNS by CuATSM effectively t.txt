Abstract
Over-expression of mutant copper, zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD) in mice induces ALS and 
has become the most widely used model of neurodegeneration. However, no pharmaceutical agent 
in twenty years has extended lifespan by more than a few weeks. The Copper-Chaperone-for-SOD 
(CCS) protein completes the maturation of SOD by inserting copper, but paradoxically human 
CCS causes mice co-expressing mutant SOD to die within two weeks of birth. Hypothesizing that 
co-expression of CCS created copper deficiency in spinal cord, we treated these pups with the 
PET-imaging agent CuATSM, which is known to deliver copper into the CNS within minutes. 
CuATSM prevented the early mortality of CCSxSOD mice, while markedly increasing Cu,Zn 
SOD protein in their ventral spinal cord. Remarkably, continued treatment with CuATSM

 extended the survival of these mice by an average of 18 months. When CuATSM treatment was 
stopped, these mice developed ALS-related symptoms and died within three months. Restoring 
CuATSM treatment could rescue these mice after they became symptomatic, providing a means to 
start and stop disease progression. All ALS patients also express human CCS, raising the hope that 
familial SOD ALS patients could respond to CuATSM treatment similarly to the CCSxSOD mice.

Introduction
Mouse and rat models of ALS produced by the overexpression of mutant copper, zinc 
superoxide dismutase (SOD) recapitulate the human disease with higher fidelity than other 
models based on more recently discovered ALS-associated mutations. Mutant SODs also 
confer a toxic gain-of-function that leads to motor neuron degeneration in humans, dogs, 
zebrafish and Drosophila. The first mouse model based on high-expression SODG93A (1) 
has now become the most widely used model for any neurodegenerative disease. The 
symptoms of ALS become obvious in these mice around 100 days of age as the mice lose 
weight and their hind limbs atrophy. Recent studies have established that subtle symptoms 
start earlier than 30 days (2, 3).
However, frustration with the SOD models of ALS has grown because twenty years of 
testing in ALS-mutant SOD mice have failed to yield an effective therapy in mice or man. 
Few pharmaceutical treatments have been able to extend life by even 10–15% in the high-
expressing SODG93A mice and no agent has been successfully translated into human 
treatments. The Prize4Life.org renewed its offer of $1 million for a therapeutic solution that 
extends life by 25% in the high-expressing SODG93A mice. The goal may seem modest 
because simply breeding from the standard B6SJL hybrid of these mice to a homogenous B6 
background extends life by 21% from 130 ± 12 to 157 ± 9 days (4). Yet, the 25% extension 
of life has not been achieved reproducibly by any pharmaceutical approach and the

 treatment of any SOD-based model of ALS has proven to be a formidable and elusive 
challenge.
To approach this problem from a different angle, we began exploring what processes 
accelerate the development of motor neuron disease in SOD mice. The most rapid 
acceleration of ALS ever described results when the human Copper-Chaperone-for-SOD 
(CCS) is co-expressed with human SOD; low-expressing SODG93A mice co-expressing CCS 
die of ALS in 30–50 days, about eight times faster than those without expression of human 
CCS (5).
Understanding why CCS accelerates toxicity of SODG93A in mice is important because ALS 
patients express human CCS in a much higher ratio to SOD compared to the ratio of mouse 
CCS to human SODG93A expressed in transgenic mice (6). Son and Elliott (7) clearly 
showed that copper-dependent cytochrome c oxidase activity is greatly reduced in the low-
expressing SODG93AxCCS mice, consistent with an apparent copper deficiency within the 
spinal cord. Copper distribution in vivo is determined by affinity gradients with SOD having 
the strongest affinity for copper (8). Thus, overexpression of CCS has been proposed to 
impair copper-import into mitochondria in low-expressing SODG93AxCCS mice (5, 9).
Among the most promising therapeutics for ALS is the copper complex CuATSM. It is 
protective in the low expressing SODG93A and SODG37R ALS mouse models, extending life 
by 15% and 26% respectively (10, 11). CuATSM is used as a PET-imaging agent for 
hypoxic tumors in humans (12), has low toxicity, and penetrates the blood-brain barrier of 
ALS patients in minutes (13). The ATSM moiety is a small hydrophobic ligand with a high 
affinity for copper in the 2+ oxidation state (14). The rationale for the use of CuATSM as a 
PET scanning agent comes from selective release of copper in hypoxic tissues that are able 
to reduce copper to the 1+ oxidation state (15). The unusually low reduction potential of 
CuATSM prevents copper release in most tissues (14), but allows selective release of copper 
in cells with damaged mitochondria (15).
We have recently shown that CuATSM can deliver copper to SOD in SODG37R mice (16). 
Because of its ability to deliver copper safely, we hypothesized that CuATSM could protect 
ALS transgenic models expressing human CCS by providing copper to partially folded 
intermediates of SOD. The toxic gain-of-function appears to involve partially unfolded 
intermediates of SOD, which often lack the metal cofactors critical for stabilizing SOD (17). 
To quantify binding of copper and zinc to SOD, we have developed a mass spectrometric 
method to measure the entire SOD protein directly from ventral spinal cord of ALS-affected 
tissues. This method revealed that nearly half of the SOD protein in the spinal cord of 
mutant SOD mice was Cu,Zn SOD, while the remaining half of SOD protein predominately 
contained zinc but not copper (18, 19). Based upon these observations, we therefore 
investigated how CuATSM might modulate copper binding to SOD and affect the survival 
of transgenic SOD mice co-expressing CCS.

 Results
Without CuATSM treatment, pups expressing SODG93A with CCS were clearly identifiable 
as runts in the litter as early as 4 days. They lagged littermates in development by several 
days and died in 8–13 days (Fig. 1A). Because the early mortality was most likely due to 
copper deficiency affecting mitochondria during development (7), we tested whether 
CuATSM would rescue the early death. CuATSM dissolved in DMSO applied dermally to 
the back of the pup’s neck was found to be absorbed within ten minutes, which provided a 
simple means to treat young pups. Remarkably, CuATSM-treated pups could respond within 
hours with increased mobility. We then tested a variety of CuATSM-dosing schemes to 
rescue the pups and found that the best protection came from first treating mothers during 
pregnancy and then treating pups starting at 5 days of age with 30 mg/kg/dose CuATSM 
twice daily. The prenatal CuATSM treatment allowed all treated pups to grow normally and 
completely prevented early mortality. Once a treatment regime for CuATSM was found that 
was safe and avoided the early mortality, we organized blinded randomized trials to 
compare how CuATSM affected the survival of SODG93A mice with and without human 
CCS co-expression.
CuATSM Treatment of CCSxSODG93A mice
This trial had three treatment arms as shown in the Scheme at the top of Fig. 1. The first arm 
assessed the efficacy of continuous treatment. The second arm assessed the effects of 
stopping CuATSM treatment at 21 days of age when the critical window for copper in 
perinatal development had passed (20, 21). The third arm assessed whether restoring 
CuATSM treatment after symptom development could inhibit further ALS progression.
Continuous treatment
Continuous treatment with CuATSM kept 17 of 17 high-expressing SODG93AxCCS mice 
alive for past a year (Fig. 1A; p = 1.6e-9 versus the untreated group using the Cox 
proportional hazard model with the likelihood ratio test). The continuously treated mice 
remained remarkably active even after a year (Supplemental Video 1), but most developed 
motor issues in their hind limbs by 600 days. The continuously treated mice gained 
excessive weight during the first year, but subsequently lost weight starting around 300 days 
(Fig. 1B). The first mouse reached end-stage motor neuron symptoms at 366 days while five 
others reached end stage between 530 to 660 days. Seven of the 17 mice were censored due 
to unrelated health issues that arose mostly in their second year of life (Supplemental Table 
S1).
Symptoms for SODG93AxCCS mice who started to progress were milder than in the 
standard SODG93A mice, with the hind limbs suffering less atrophy while the forelimbs 
remained largely unaffected. The mice exhibited spasticity in their hind limbs with their toes 
extended. Considerable strength remained in the extensor muscles. The mice lost weight, but 
far more gradually than SODG93A mice reaching end stage. The long survival could not be 
explained by a loss of SOD gene copy number, because all mice retained their full SOD 
copy number as shown by qPCR (Supplemental Fig. S1) and as described below

 accumulated substantially more SOD protein in ventral spinal cord than SODG93A mice 
without CCS.
Withdrawal of CuATSM
In the second treatment arm, CuATSM treatment was stopped at 21 days. These 
SODG93AxCCS mice continued to grow normally for 6–8 weeks, but then developed hind 
limb spasticity between 70–90 days. All became end stage between 122 to 132 days with 
motor symptoms primarily affecting the hind limbs (Fig. 1A; n=6; p = 1.3e-5 versus the 
untreated group). Their survival was similar to that of the standard SODG93A mice.
Restarting CuATSM
In the third treatment arm, CuATSM treatment was stopped at 21 days (n=7; p = 4.3e-6 
versus the untreated group) until the mice exhibited ataxia at approximately 80 days. Twice 
daily treatments with 30 mg/kg CuATSM were then resumed. The mice gradually recovered 
over the next two months and gained weight (Fig. 1B). The severity of symptoms was 
reduced, but three of the mice eventually developed progressive ALS symptoms 120–180 
days later and were sacrificed at 302–377 days of age. Three others were sacrificed due to 
other issues unrelated to ALS as marked on Fig 1A and described in Supplemental Table S1.
Protection obtained with related experimental treatments
Additional test groups of SODG93AxCCS mice have been treated with different dosages of 
CuATSM, including mice used to test different dosing methods. Aggregating all of these 
groups receiving continuous treatment with CuATSM revealed that 36 of 36 SODG93AxCCS 
mice remained healthy well past 180 days. This age is 38% longer than the average 130-day 
survival of untreated SODG93A mice. Some of SODG93AxCCS mice receiving low dosages 
of CuATSM in pilot experiments became symptomatic between 230–380 days of age. These 
mice were examined by immunohistology and exhibited reactive astrocytosis and 
nitrotyrosine accumulation in motor neurons (Fig. 2A–B). They had 50% fewer motor 
neurons compared to CCS littermates or asymptomatic mice remaining on CuATSM 
treatment (Fig. 2C). Intense nitration of the motor neurons was found relative to CCS-
control spinal cord, particularly in the environment of motor neurons in the symptomatic 
spinal cord. Withdrawal of CuATSM resulted in increased nitrotyrosine accumulation and a 
pronounced astrogliosis when the mice became end stage (Fig. 2D). The hippocampus of 
CuATSM-treated mice appeared unaffected even in symptomatic mice surviving as long as 
650 days (Supplemental Figure S2).
Rescue of symptomatic low-expressing SODG93AxCCS mice—Co-expression of 
CCS in low-expressing SODG93A mice decreased survival to the 20–50 day range as 
previously reported (5). Starting treatment with CuATSM at 24 days of age rescued low-
expressing SODG93AxCCS mice (n=5) from the early death initially described (5). These 
mice regained weight, showed improved movement within a week, and continued to survive 
with minimal residual symptoms. At the time treatment was started, these mice had hind 
limb weakness with impaired coordination and would typically succumb if untreated after 
another week. All 5 mice remain alive and healthy at 480 days. Untreated litters of low-
expressing SODG93AxCCS mice with similar symptoms became end stage within a week.

 Low-expressing SODG93A mice without CCS normally reach end-stage at 240–260 days (5, 
9)
CuATSM and survival in SODG93A mice without CCS co-expression—Without 
CCS co-expression, CuATSM still provided substantial protection to high-expressing 
SODG93A mice (Fig. 3). Based upon prior results (11) that showed a strong dose-dependence 
on survival in SODG37R mice, we chose to use the maximum possible dosage of CuATSM 
(100 mg/kg/dose) that could be practically delivered via dermal application in DMSO. This 
dose is approximately three times higher than used to treat the CCS co-expressing mice. It 
was similarly administered twice daily. When started at 50 days of age, CuATSM extended 
the median survival of SODG93A mice by 22 days, a 16% increase relative to DMSO-treated 
mice (Fig. 3A; p = 1.6e-5). CuATSM-treated mice had a median survival of 155 ± 14 days, 
while the DMSO-treated control mice had a median survival of 133 ± 12 days.
While the delay of symptom onset and extension of survival were highly significant, 
CuATSM did not affect the progression of the disease as measured by development of 
abnormal gait, by dragging of hind limbs, or by use of hind limbs for forward propulsion, 
relative to the time when mice became end stage (Fig. 3B). Thus, the time of onset was 
delayed by CuATSM treatment, but disease progression was unaffected for both early and 
late-stage symptoms. Nine mice in total were censored during these studies and are 
described in Supplemental Table S2.
When both mothers and SODG93A pups were treated with 100 mg /kg/dose of CuATSM 
twice daily, the median survival of the SODG93A mice increased by 25% to 166 ± 14 days 
compared to the DMSO treated group (Fig. 3; p = 3.2e-6). The additional protection from 
early treatment was consistent with motor neuron pathology starting much earlier than 
commonly thought (2, 3, 22).
Impact of CuATSM and CCS on Cytochrome c Oxidase Activity—The copper-
dependent activity of cytochrome c oxidase in ventral spinal cord was nearly equal in mice 
expressing wild-type SOD, mice expressing just SODG93A with or without CuATSM 
treatment, and mice expressing SODG93AxCCS that were continuously treated with 30 
mg/kg of CuATSM (Fig. 4). This measured activity is consistent with previously reported 
activities in nontransgenic mice using the same assay methodology (23). When CuATSM 
was withdrawn from SODG93AxCCS mice, cytochrome c oxidase activity in spinal cord was 
reduced by 75% when these mice reached end stage around 130 days. In the SODG93AxCCS 
mice used for our initial dose-finding experiments, cytochrome c oxidase activity in spinal 
cord was highly variable but reduced by an average of 30%. These mice received a fifth of 
the CuATSM dosage and survived for 280–370 days.
Impact of CuATSM and CCS on SODG93A protein and metal content—Human 
SODG93A protein is well known to be highly expressed in SODG93A mice based upon 
activity measurements (24). Using mass spectrometry methods that kept copper and zinc 
bound to the SOD protein, we found that nontransgenic mice contained a total of 3–4 µM of 
the endogenous mouse Cu,Zn SOD in ventral spinal cord (all concentrations here refer to the 
monomer). In contrast, human SODG93A mice expressed nearly 50 times more human SOD

 protein (210±18 µM) when they reached end-stage. Approximately 50% of total SOD was 
present as mature Cu,Zn SOD, which is the most stable and enzymatically active form of 
SOD. Less than 7% was apoSOD that lacked both copper and zinc. The remaining 43% 
contained zinc but not copper. This copper-deficient SOD will readily form a heterodimer 
with CCS where the copper from CCS is transferred to form Cu,Zn SOD (25, 26). However, 
the slow import of copper into the CNS apparently limited the maturation of copper-
deficient SOD by CCS to form Cu,Zn SOD in CCSxSODG93A mice.
Using CuATSM to deliver copper into the CNS, we found that the concentration of Cu,Zn 
SOD increased in SODG93A mice without CCS co-expression. This increase amounted to 
85–90 µM additional Cu,Zn SODG93A protein accumulating in treated mice (Fig. 5; p=.003 
by ANOVA). This increase was consistent with treated mice surviving 20 days to 60 days 
longer than untreated mice, allowing more time for Cu,Zn SOD to accumulate. CuATSM 
treatment reduced the percentage of copper-deficient SOD by 15–21%, but this percentage 
remained relatively constant whether the treatment lasted for 1–2 months or for as long as 5–
6 months (Fig. 5A). These results suggest that copper loading into SOD in the CNS of 
SODG93A mice reached a rate-limiting process that was too slow to keep up with SOD 
synthesis, which we hypothesized was due to the limited amount of endogenous mouse CCS 
relative to human SOD protein.
This hypothesis was tested using SODG93AxCCS mice. With the increased expression of 
human CCS, CuATSM treatment of these mice resulted in the lowest percentages of copper-
deficient SOD that we have ever observed in ventral spinal cord (Fig. 5B). Combined 
CuATSM treatment with CCS overexpression also led to a remarkable accumulation of 
Cu,Zn SOD, which reached 340±45 µM in the long surviving CCSxSODG93A mice. This is 
a hundred fold more SOD protein compared to the endogenous mouse SOD and nearly twice 
as much SOD protein as found in SODG93A mouse spinal cord without CCS coexpression.
Withdrawal of CuATSM when the mice were 21 days of age resulted in a slight decrease in 
total SOD compared with continuous treatment at the same age. Withdrawal did not result in 
subsequent accumulation of copper-deficient SOD when the mice reached end stage 110 
days later. Thus, CuATSM may have other actions in addition to copper-delivery to allow 
SOD to mature to its fully active and stable form.
Discussion
The remarkable protection by CuATSM in SODG93AxCCS mice reveals the complex 
interplay of copper in survival of motor neurons during development and in their demise 
from mutant SOD expression. Without CCS co-expression, CuATSM is still among the 
most effective pharmaceutical agents in high-expressing SODG93A mice among the 
hundreds tested in this model so far (27). With CCS co-expression, CuATSM helped meet 
the apparent early demand for copper during development resulting from overexpression of 
human CCS. In addition, CuATSM essentially increased survival of high expressing 
SODG93A mice to beyond 600 days while the doubling amount of SOD protein (Fig. 1). 
Furthermore, withdrawal of CuATSM initiated motor neuron disease progression, while 
restarting treatment arrested further progression of symptomatic mice for 180–270 days.

 This makes possible the pharmacological control of disease progression in SOD-transgenic 
mice with CuATSM.
Overexpression of human SOD in transgenic mice is known to induce widespread changes 
in copper homeostasis in the spinal cord (28). The basis for these changes likely results from 
the large demand created for copper by the accumulation of copper-deficient, zinc-bound 
SOD in spinal cord that we have identified by mass spectrometry (16, 18, 19). The 
accumulation of copper-deficient SOD is consistent with other reports using indirect assays 
that show copper depletion from the protein in multiple ALS-associated mutant SODs in 
transgenic mice (24, 29).
The accumulation of copper-deficient, zinc-bound SOD as the predominant form of 
misfolded SOD in transgenic mice can be reconciled with recent findings on the importance 
of zinc in modulating the folding landscape of SOD (17). Zinc has been shown to accelerate 
the kinetics of folding of the apoSOD protein by 100-fold, in addition to stabilizing the SOD 
monomer thermodynamically by 13 kcal/monomer (17). Because zinc strongly stabilizes 
unfolded SOD protein, zinc-containing SOD accumulates in the spinal cord awaiting copper 
from CCS to complete its maturation to Cu,Zn SOD. Copper transport into other organs is 
much faster than into the spinal cord and brain, which is consistent with the accumulation of 
copper-deficient SOD in the CNS (30).
There are only about a dozen enzymes in humans that bind copper (31). The vast majority of 
intracellular copper is bound primarily by two enzymes, cytochrome c oxidase and Cu,Zn 
SOD. A complex network of copper transporters and chaperones provides the intracellular 
delivery of copper to these two enzymes. The net distribution is driven by the relative 
affinity gradients for copper (8), with CCS having a stronger affinity for copper than the 
chaperones for cytochrome c oxidase. The expression of human CCS in the SODG93AxCCS 
mice removes the kinetic barrier for loading copper into zinc-containing SOD. This allows 
more of the copper in the CNS to be diverted into SOD, thereby exacerbating the copper 
deficiency created by SOD overexpression. Withdrawal of CuATSM from SODG93AxCCS 
mice resulted in a 75% decrease in cytochrome c oxidase activity when these mice reached 
end stage at 130 days (Fig. 4), where as SODG93A mice reaching end stage at about the same 
age had no apparent decrease in cytochrome c oxidase activity. These data support the role 
of human CCS overexpression in increasing delivery of copper to SOD at the expense of 
depleting copper from mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (5, 7).
Mitochondria in the spinal cord are well-known to be a target in motor neuron diseases (32) 
and both CCS and SOD enter as metal-deficient forms in the mitochondrial intermembrane 
space in SOD-transgenic mice (33–37). This mitochondrial-localized fraction of SOD with 
CCS should be particularly effective at competing with cytochrome c oxidase for copper and 
potentially can contribute to the accelerated death of SODG93AxCCS mice. The time course 
for the early death in our double transgenic mice is similar to that observed in pregnant mice 
that have been given copper-deficient diets in late pregnancy (21), and in rat pups made 
copper-deficient prenatally; these pups also suffer from life-long motor deficits (20). These 
results are consistent with the need to treat high-expressing SODG93AxCCS mice early with

 CuATSM to avoid the consequences of severe copper deficiency during perinatal 
development.
An eight-fold increase of endogenous mouse CCS expression is one of the major changes 
observed in copper homeostasis resulting from SOD overexpression (28). In non-transgenic 
cells, approximately one CCS molecule is expressed per 7–14 SOD monomers (6). In the 
high-expressing SODG93A mice, there are 27 genomic DNA copies of human SOD plus the 
two endogenous mouse SOD alleles, compared to just two endogenous copies of mouse 
CCS. Thus, the eight-fold increase in expression likely represents the upper limit of 
endogenous CCS possible, but still too low to meet the increased demand created by human 
SOD overexpression. Our mass spectrometry assays in SODG93A mice show that 
endogenous mouse CCS cannot catalyze the complete maturation of human SOD in these 
mice when treated with CuATSM (Fig. 5). Although human and mouse CCS share 86% 
identity (38), the efficiency of mouse CCS interacting with human SOD might further limit 
copper delivery. Thus, the accumulation of copper-deficient SOD in the CNS may result 
from diminished efficiency for mouse CCS delivering copper to human SOD, which is 
further amplified by the dramatic difference in expression of CCS to SOD. Because co-
expression of human CCS in the SODG93AxCCS mice more closely replicates the balance of 
CCS with SOD found in humans, familial ALS-SOD patients could potentially respond to 
CuATSM treatment more like SODG93AxCCS mice than the standard SODG93A model.
Familial ALS caused by SOD mutations represent only 2–7% of all ALS cases (39), but 
there is growing evidence that wild-type SOD can participate in sporadic ALS (40–42). 
CuATSM might also have additional protective actions, such as restoring mitochondrial 
function. CuATSM is also known to reduce cytosolic accumulation of TDP43 both in vitro 
(43) and in vivo (10). A broader potential role for CuATSM beyond ALS is suggested by its 
efficacy in treating four mouse models of Parkinson’s disease that are unrelated to mutant 
SOD (44). In addition to supplying copper, CuATSM is also a scavenger of peroxynitrite in 
these models (44) and this mode of action is consistent with a role in ALS as well (45–47). 
Tyrosine nitration was reduced in the SODG93AxCCS mice treated with CuATSM (Fig. 2). 
Characterization of these alternative protective actions of CuATSM may help further 
improve efficacy as well as identify additional mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of 
ALS. Collectively, these studies provide a rationale for testing CuATSM in sporadic as well 
as familial SOD patients. Because CuATSM also rescues symptomatic low-expressing 
SODG93AxCCS mice that were never treated as pups, pretreatment of ALS patients may not 
necessarily be required for CuATSM to be protective.
Multiple lines of evidence now support the importance of copper as a pathogenic factor in 
ALS (16, 24, 28, 48, 49). The vulnerability of motor neurons to altered copper homeostasis 
is highlighted by the discovery that specific mutations in the copper transporter ATP7A 
occur in progressive X-linked spinal muscular atrophy type 3 (SMAX3) (50). A causal 
linkage is supported by the targeted knockout in motor neurons of ATP7A in mice, which 
results in motor neuron degeneration (51).
Because copper uptake in the CNS is highly regulated and its turnover is extremely slow, 
copper supplements cannot replace CuATSM for treating ALS. Copper supplements can

 damage the liver and are generally toxic at high dosages. CuATSM offers a safe delivery 
vehicle to bypass the distribution system naturally limiting copper transport into the CNS, 
providing sufficient copper for CCS to complete the maturation of Cu,Zn SOD while 
avoiding the toxicity of high dietary copper intake.
Materials and Methods
Mouse breeding and husbandry
All mice procedures were conducted in AAALAC approved facilities following current 
ethical regulations of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National 
Institutes of Health (USA) international guidelines and were approved by Oregon State 
University’s Institutional Animal Committee. Male SOD transgenic mice expressing 
SODG93A, both the high-expressing SODG93A mice (B6SJL-Tg(SOD1*G93A)1Gur/J) and 
low-expressing SODG93A ((B6SJL-Tg(SOD1*G93A)dl1Gur/J) were obtained from The 
Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). These animals were bred against non-transgenic 
hybrid female mice (B6SJL/J) also obtained from Jackson Laboratory to generate additional 
SODG93A transgenic mice. Transgenic mouse line 17 expressing human CCS under control 
of the PRP promoter was previously described (5). The CCS mice have been maintained on 
the same heterozygous background as the SOD mice. Initially, SODG93AxCCS mice were 
produced by crossing male SODG93A mice with hemizygous CCS+/− mice. To maximize the 
number of double transgenic mice generated in each litter, we subsequently bred the CCS 
mice to homozygosity. Subsequent SODG93AxCCS were generated by breeding male 
SODG93A mice against homozygous female CCS mice to produce litters composed entirely 
of heterozygous CCS mice. Both SODG93AxCCS and SODG93A mice had their SOD copy 
number verified by qPCR using mouse tissue obtained directly from The Jackson 
Laboratory as the reference standard for gene copy number (Fig. S1). The qPCR protocol for 
SOD was identical to that described by Appendix A from the Jackson Laboratory Manual 
for SODG93A mice (4).
Study Design
To produce the large numbers of mice needed quickly for therapeutic trials, five male 
SODG93A mice were purchased from Jackson Labs. When the males were within the 
breeding age for SODG93A mice (49–75 days of age), each was placed in a cage with two 
female breeders on the same hybrid background purchased from Jackson Laboratories. After 
4–5 days, the males were transferred to new cages containing additional female breeders. 
The pairs of female breeders produced litters within 1–2 days of each other that were treated 
as one group for randomization to treatment cages. The pups were genotyped by PCR at 18–
20 days of age and weaned at 21 days of age. Mice from these litters were randomized to 
pairs of cages containing 3–4 mice per cage and balanced as closely as possible for coat 
color. Males were housed separately from females and equal numbers of both sexes were 
enrolled in the trials. Groups of matched pairs of cages were blindly allocated to treatment 
after filling the cages was completed. Several littermates that were nontransgenic for 
SODG93A were also included and evaluated blindly throughout the study. The 
SODG93AxCCS mice were produced similarly by transferring male hemizygous SODG93A 
mice into cages containing two homozygous CCS female breeders.

 Statistical Analysis
The survival of SODG93A mice was evaluated by the Cox Proportional Hazards Model using 
the likelihood ratio to test statistical significance from SAS 9.4 (PHREG procedure). The 
Wald statistic commonly used to calculate significance in Cox Proportional Hazards 
statistical test fails with the SODG93AxCCS studies because of the large separation of 
survival time between groups. Equivalent highly significant differences were obtained with 
the nonparametric Mantel-Cox (Log-Rank) test (not shown). Power analyses for the 
SODG93AxCCS studies showed that a group size of 1 mouse surviving past 180 days would 
be highly significant using either the survival of untreated SODG93AxCCS or SODG93A 
mice. A minimum group size of six mice was chosen for each group.
Treatment Group Assignments and Randomization
The study was randomized by assigning balanced cages to treatment groups and the 
treatment groups were gender-balanced. The assignment of treatment for the paired groups 
of cages was randomized by a coin flip by a technician in another laboratory just prior to 
initiation of treatment.
Survival Endpoints and Symptom Assessment for SODG93A mice
The failure of SODG93A mice to right themselves after 30 seconds is the de facto standard 
for end-of-life because death invariably follows within 1–3 days (52). These mice have 
flaccid hind limbs and have lost significant forelimb strength that prevents them from 
righting themselves or moving effectively around the cage. In concordance with discussions 
with our attending veterinarian and the IACUC committee, SODG93A mice were deemed to 
be end stage when they could no longer right themselves after 15 seconds. The mice were 
treated morning and evening and assessed at each treatment time for the ability to right 
themselves on both sides. They were given three opportunities to do so. In our prior 
experience, mice that failed to right themselves in 15 seconds only rarely could right 
themselves within 30 seconds (53).
Separate blinded evaluations were conducted for symptom progression. Cages were de-
identified by one technician one cage at a time and presented to a blinded observer working 
in a sterile hood for evaluation. The blinded observer wore red safety goggles to eliminate 
their ability to see residual red color from CuATSM on the mouse coat. A random number 
generator was used to determine the order of cages to be evaluated. Each animal was given a 
score of 0 to 3 (0-Animals had no obvious symptoms; 1- Animal has an abnormal gait; 2- 
Animals dragged hind limb at least twice in a 12 inch span; 3 – Animal is not using limb for 
forward motion).
Assessment of SODG93AxCCS mice
These mice did not experience the same disease progression as SODG93A mice and we 
realized that the end stage determination described for SODG93A mice was inappropriate. 
The CuATSM-treated SODG93AxCCS mice generally fail the traditional right test when 
placed on a solid surface, but were still able to right themselves in the cage bedding 
material, move around the cage, feed themselves and after an initial weight loss maintained 
their weight until the last week. Notably, these mice maintain their forelimb strength. Their

 difficulty in righting themselves on a solid surface was due to the rigid extension of the hind 
limbs that interfered with rolling over when using the front paws. In the cage, the hind limbs 
are able to sink into the bedding allowing the animal to stay upright and use its forelimbs for 
movement. In consultation with the head veterinarian and staff, the endpoint was chosen to 
be the failure of mice after three attempts to move 15 cm on a solid surface covered with an 
absorbent paper towel. Although the difference in survival assessment added at least 2–4 
weeks to the apparent survival, the end stage SODG93AxCCS mice were still far more 
mobile than their SODG93A counterparts.
Mice censured from trials
All censured mice are described in Supplemental Table 1 and 2. There was one major 
sudden incidence of mortality when 4 CuATSM-treated mice and 2 DMSO-treated mice at 
approximately 100 days of age died from a severe gastrointestinal inflammation apparent on 
autopsy. Several mice undergoing DMSO-based treatments independently of the trials 
reported here also died unexpectedly at this time. The toxicity apparently resulted from a 
new staff member sterilizing gloves with Clidox (aqueous chlorine dioxide), which may 
have been absorbed with DMSO during handling. After switching to 70% ethanol for 
sterilization of gloves, no deaths have occurred in the following 20 months using the same 
CuATSM preparation at the same dose.
Applying CuATSM treatments
Mice were treated twice daily by applying a 15 µg/µL solution of CuATSM dissolved in 
DMSO directly to the skin on the neck and back of each mouse with a pipette. For larger 
doses, the CuATSM is applied in multiple streaks down the back to maximize absorption. 
Animals were not shaved as the fur helped to keep the compound on the animal as they 
moved around the cage following treatment. Doses were adjusted weekly for each cage by 
weighing all animals and calculating the dose based on the heaviest mouse in the cage. 
Animals assigned to a DMSO-treatment group had equivalent volumes of DMSO applied.
Animals were anesthetized with isofluorane, followed by transcardial perfusion with 
heparinized PBS. The spinal column was dissected from mice without isolating the spinal 
cord. Tissues were then either fixed for immunohistochemical staining as described below or 
frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen tissues were stored at −80 °C until time of use.
Immunohistochemical staining of mouse spinal cords and brains
Animals were deeply anesthetized and transcardial perfusion was performed with 0.9% 
saline and 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.2–7.4) at a constant flow of 1 mL/min. 
Fixed spinal cord was removed, post-fixed by immersion in fixative for 24 h, and then 
transversely sectioned (30–40 µm) on a vibrating microtome (Leica 1000s). Serial sections 
were collected in 100 mM PBS for immunohistochemistry. Free-floating sections were 
permeabilized for 30 min at room temperature with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS, washed with 
buffered solutions, blocked with 5% BSA:PBS for 1 hour at room temperature, and 
incubated overnight at 4 °C in a solution of 0.3% Triton X-100 and PBS containing the 
primary antibodies, mouse anti-nitrotyrosine (1:200, Millipore), rabbit anti-GFAP (1:500, 
Sigma), or rabbit anti-ChAT (1:300, Millipore). Nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity was

 completely blocked by preincubation of the primary antibody with free nitrotyrosine (10 
mM at pH 7.4). After washing, sections were incubated in 1:1,000-diluted secondary 
antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 633. (Invitrogen). Antibodies were 
detected by confocal microscopy using a confocal Zeiss LSM 510 META. For Nissl and 
myelin staining, the sections were permeabilized for 10 minutes with PBS+ 0.1% Triton 
X-100. After washing twice in PBS for 5 minutes, sections were incubated with Nissl 
NeuroTrace (1:200, Invitrogen) and fluoroMyelin (1:500, Invitrogen) in PBS for 20 minutes 
and washing for 10 min in PBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100. The stain was removed and 
sections washed 3 times in PBS over 2 h. To examine the brain for possible changes, 30 
brain slices were block for 1 h at room temperature in PBS-Triton 0.25% - BSA 5%. GFAP 
antibody (Sigma #G9269, 1:500) was incubated overnight at 4 °C. Nissl staining (Thermo 
Scientific, 1:400) was incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature.
CuATSM synthesis and formulation
ATSM was synthesized by adding 4.8 g 4-methyl-3-thiosemicarbazide to 100 mL dry 
ethanol heated to 60°C until completely in solution. While stirring, 2 mL of diacetyl (2,3-
butadione) was pipetted into the vessel. Ten drops of concentrated sulfuric acid was added to 
accelerate the reaction. ATSM precipitated as an off-white powder that was collected by 
filtration. The ATSM precipitate was washed with ethanol and methanol and then vacuum 
dried. These reaction conditions were the most commonly used, but we were successful 
preparing ATSM using different concentrations and proportions of precursors. All reagents 
were obtained from TCI America (Portland, OR).
To incorporate copper, 4 g ATSM was stirred at room temperature in 100 mL of methanol. 
The vast majority of the ATSM did not dissolve. Both ATSM and CuATSM have limited 
solubility in methanol, but it is sufficient to facilitate complete copper loading into ATSM. 
160 µL of 100 mM copper chloride in water was added drop-wise to the vessel and the 
mixture stirred for 30 min. To collect the product, 100 mL of water was added to completely 
precipitate CuATSM. CuATSM was collected via filtration and washed with methanol and 
water on the filter prior to vacuum drying. Mass spectrometry confirmed stoichiometric 
metal loading into CuATSM. The most common impurity seen was clusters of CuATSM 
with excess copper loading, such as two ATSM molecules with three bound copper atoms. 
Excess bound copper was removed by additional washing of the product with methanol and 
water.
To prepare CuATSM for dosing mice, 1.5 g CuATSM was added to a volumetric flask, 
brought to volume with 100 mL of dry pharmaceutical grade DMSO and dissolved in a bath 
sonicator for 15 min. CuATSM would not dissolve in DMSO contaminated with water. By 
using fresh bottles of dry DMSO and minimizing exposure to moisture, CuATSM solutions 
were stable in the freezer for many months and for over a week at room temperature.
SOD Quantitation
High-resolution mass spectrometry (ThermoFinnigan 7 Tesla FT-ICR Ultra Mass 
Spectrometer) was performed on homogenized spinal cord punches as previously described 
(16, 18, 19). Approximately 200 µg of ventral spinal cord tissue was weighed on a Cahn 25

 Automatic Electrobalance (Cerritos, CA, USA) and homogenized for 30 seconds in 10 mM 
ammonium acetate buffer with an adapted microcentrifuge tube pestle. A hole drilled in the 
shaft of the pestle allowed for complete sample and buffer recovery by briefly centrifuging 
the homogenate while the pestle was suspended above the sample by a paper clip. After 
removing the pestle, a supernatant was generated by centrifuging the sample for 2 minutes at 
13,000×g. Aliquots of the supernatant were loaded onto the mass spectrometer via a C4 
ZipTip® (Millipore). Bovine SOD was added to aliquots (final concentration of 300 nM) as 
an internal standard for quantitation. The data were analyzed using a custom Matlab™ 
program that calculates theoretical isotope distributions of SOD to identify the different 
metal bound species (19).
Cytochrome c oxidase assays
This activity was determined by following the oxidation of reduced cytochrome c as 
decreased absorbance at 550 nm. Reduced cytochrome c was prepared by incubating horse 
heart cytochrome c (Sigma) with ascorbic acid; excess ascorbic acid was removed using a 
centrifugal filter unit (3,000 MWCO). Tissue punches (~500 µg wet weight) were collected 
on dry ice from frozen brain motor cortex and then homogenized (10 µg/µl) in 50 mM 
phosphate buffer pH 7 containing 20 µM EDTA with 24 units/ml catalase and 0.1% Triton 
X-100 added immediately prior to the time of enzyme assay. Tissue homogenate was diluted 
1:250. Enzyme activity defined as one unit oxidizing 1.0 µmole of ferrocytochrome c per 
minute at 25°C, pH 7.0 per mg wet tissue, using 21.8 mM−1.cm−1 as the differential 
extinction coefficient for horse heart cytochrome c.

 Highlights
1.
The copper ligand CuATSM extends life in high-expressing SODG93A mice by 
up to 25%.
2.
CuATSM in high-expressing SODG93A mice co-expressing CCS survive for 20 
months (500%)!
3.
Motor neuron disease can be restarted and then stopped by controlling CuATSM 
treatment.
4.
CCS plus copper nearly doubles the amount of SOD protein in mouse spinal 
cord.
5.
The vast majority of the mutant SOD is found in its mature and active form, 
Cu,Zn SOD.

 Figure 1. CuATSM treatment and survival of SODG93AxCCS mice
The dosing schedule with CuATSM (30 mg/kg given twice a day) is shown on the top as 
maroon bars. (A) Kaplan-Meier plot of ALS-survival probability of SODG93AxCCS mice 
receiving either no treatment (black dashed line, n=15), CuATSM treatment stopped at 
weaning (blue, n=6), treatment stopped at weaning and restarted at symptom onset (dashed 
grey-blue, n=7), and continuous CuATSM treatment (black, n=17). Censored mice are 
shown as black circles or grey-blue diamonds. (B) Weights with standard deviations for the

 Figure 2. Motor neuron death, astrogliosis and tyrosine nitration during the symptomatic phase 
in CCSxSODG93A mice
All of the mice shown have been treated with CuATSM, which was necessary to allow the 
SODG93AxCCS mice to survive the first two weeks after birth. (A) Representative images of 
glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP red) and choline acetyl transferase (ChAT blue) in lumbar 
spinal cord sections from transgenic CCS and symptomatic SODG93AxCCS mice illustrate 
how reactive astrocytes surround motor neurons during the symptomatic phase in the 
SODG93AxCCS mice. In particular, swollen GFAP(+) astrocytes (white arrows) surround 
choline acetyl transferase-positive (ChAT) motor neurons in the symptomatic spinal cord 
(scale bar = 10 µm). (B) Higher expression of nitrotyrosine in the spinal cord is observed 
during the symptomatic phase in the SODG93AxCCS mice as shown by a representative 
image of nitrotyrosine (NO2Tyr – green) costained with ChAT (blue) in lumbar spinal cord 
sections from transgenic CCS and symptomatic SODG93AxCCS mice. Scale bar, 10 µm. (C) 
Representative ChAT staining (blue) in the ventral horn of the spinal cord (the white dotted 
line demarcates the border between white and grey matter). The bar graph reports the 
number of neuronal somas located in Rexed lamina IX (mean ± SEM from 30 slices per 
group *p<0.05: scale bar = 50 µm). (D) Withdrawal of CuATSM from treated 
SODG93AxCCS increased nitration and astrocytic reactivity. The left panel shows

 nitrotyrosine (Green) and GFAP (red) in the ventral horn of the spinal cord of a 281 day-old 
continuously CuATSM-treated mouse for comparison. The right panel shows that CuATSM 
withdrawal at weaning significant increases tyrosine nitration as well as GFAP expression 
that labeled swollen astrocytes that surround motor neurons in the degenerating spinal cord 
(a white dotted line indicates motor neuron bodies; scale bar = 10 µm).

 Figure 3. Survival probability and symptom onset of SODG93A mice with CuATSM treatment
(A) Kaplan-Meier survival probabilities of SODG93A mice treated with DMSO starting at 
day 50 (solid black, n=21), CuATSM given twice daily at a dose of 100 mg/kg starting at 
day 50 (dashed dot orange, n=20), or 100 mg/kg starting at day 5 (solid orange, n=12). The 
end stage was determined when the mice could no longer pass the right test in 15 seconds. 
(B) Three stages of disease progression for SODG93A mice plotted relative to when each 
mouse reached end stage. CuATSM treatment increased survival by over 3 weeks as shown 
in panel A by delaying onset rather than affecting progression. Treatments were DMSO 
(black, n=21) or 100 mg/kg CuATSM (red, n=20) starting at day 50. The three measures for 
the onset of symptoms in relative order of severity are 1) an abnormal gait (solid lines), 2)

 Figure 4. 
Cytochrome c oxidase activity in cerebral cortex from the different treated mouse groups 
shown in Figs. 1 and 3. The Low Dose group was from pilot studies where the mice were 
treated with five lower dosages of CuATSM and developed end-stage symptoms between 
240 and 370 days. Similar cytochrome c oxidase activities were observed in spinal cords of 
these mice, but fewer samples were available due to use in SOD assays and for 
immunohistology. Activities are reported as the mean ± STD (n=3).

 Figure 5. Effect of CuATSM treatment on metal content of SOD
Concentration of apoSOD (gray), Zn-containing, Cu-deficient SOD (orange) and Cu,Zn 
SOD (green) are shown as bars with total SOD concentration as a black line above. The 
percentages of zinc-containing SOD and Cu,Zn SOD are also reported for each treatment. 
(A) The effects of CuATSM treatment on SODG93A mice, when CuATSM was started at 90 
days (30 mg/kg/dose, n=4), 50 days (100 mg/kg/dose, n=4), or 5 days (100 mg/kg/dose, 
n=4) versus a DMSO control (n=4). (B) Effect of CCS co-expression on maturation of SOD 
with CuATSM treatment starting at 5 days old. The first group shows SOD concentrations 
from SODG93AxCCS mice continuously treated with CuATSM sacrificed for biochemical 
assays at 130 days (n=2). The middle group reports SOD concentrations for continuous 
CuATSM-treated SODG93AxCCS mice that are >200 days old (n=6). The final group shows 
concentrations from ~130 day old SODG93AxCCS mice that were taken off CuATSM at 21 
days (n=5).
