ABSTRACT
Objective To test the hypothesis that the performance
of first-trimester screening for pre-eclampsia (PE) by a
method that uses Bayes’ theorem to combine maternal
factors with biomarkers is superior to that defined by
current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
(NICE) guidelines.
Methods This
was
a
prospective
multicenter
study
(screening program for pre-eclampsia (SPREE)) in seven
National Health Service maternity hospitals in England,
of women recruited between April and December 2016.
Singleton pregnancies at 11–13 weeks’ gestation had
recording of maternal characteristics and medical his-
tory and measurements of mean arterial pressure (MAP),
uterine artery pulsatility index (UtA-PI), serum placen-
tal growth factor (PlGF) and serum pregnancy-associated
plasma protein-A (PAPP-A). The performance of screen-
ing for PE by the Bayes’ theorem-based method was
compared with that of the NICE method. Primary com-
parison was detection rate (DR) using NICE method vs
mini-combined test (maternal factors, MAP and PAPP-A)
in the prediction of PE at any gestational age (all-PE)
for the same screen-positive rate determined by the
NICE method. Key secondary comparisons were DR
of screening recommended by the NICE guidelines vs
three Bayes’ theorem-based methods (maternal factors,
MAP and PAPP-A; maternal factors, MAP and PlGF;
and maternal factors, MAP, UtA-PI and PlGF) in the pre-
diction of preterm PE, defined as that requiring delivery
< 37 weeks.
Results All-PE developed in 473 (2.8%) of the 16 747
pregnancies and preterm PE developed in 142 (0.8%). The

screen-positive rate by the NICE method was 10.3% and
the DR for all-PE was 30.4% and for preterm PE it was
40.8%. Compliance with the NICE recommendation that
women at high risk for PE should be treated with aspirin
from the first trimester to the end of pregnancy was only
23%. The DR of the mini-combined test for all-PE was
42.5%, which was superior to that of the NICE method
by 12.1% (95% CI, 7.9–16.2%). In screening for preterm
PE by a combination of maternal factors, MAP and PlGF,
the DR was 69.0%, which was superior to that of the
NICE method by 28.2% (95% CI, 19.4–37.0%) and with
the addition of UtA-PI the DR was 82.4%, which was
higher than that of the NICE method by 41.6% (95% CI,
33.2–49.9%).
Conclusions The performance of screening for PE as
currently recommended by NICE guidelines is poor
and compliance with these guidelines is low. The
performance of screening is substantially improved by
a method combining maternal factors with biomarkers.

INTRODUCTION
Pre-eclampsia (PE), which complicates 2–3% of preg-
nancies, is a major cause of mortality and morbidity for
the mother and perinatal death and impairment for the
baby1,2. The risk for such complications is particularly
high when the disease is severe leading to preterm birth at
< 37 weeks’ gestation (preterm PE)3–5. Recent evidence
suggests that the risk of preterm PE can be substantially
reduced by the prophylactic use of aspirin. A multicenter

trial (ASPRE) reported that, in women with singleton
pregnancy and at high-risk for PE, aspirin (150 mg/day)
vs placebo from 11 to 14 until 36 weeks’ gestation was
associated with a 62% (95% CI, 26–80%) reduction in
the incidence of preterm PE, but had no significant effect
on the incidence of term PE6. A systematic review and
meta-analysis of 16 trials involving a combined total of
18 907 participants, including the ASPRE trial, reported
that aspirin reduces the risk of preterm PE by 67% (95%
CI, 43–81%), provided that the daily dose was ≥ 100 mg
and onset of therapy was < 16 weeks; aspirin had no
significant effect on incidence of term PE7.
In the UK, identification of the high-risk group
that could benefit from aspirin is based on maternal
characteristics and medical history as defined by the
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
guideline8. According to the guideline, women should be
considered to be at high risk of developing PE if they have
any one major factor (history of hypertensive disease in
previous pregnancy, chronic kidney disease, autoimmune
disease, diabetes mellitus or chronic hypertension) or any
two moderate factors (first pregnancy at age ≥ 40 years,
interpregnancy interval > 10 years, body mass index
at first visit ≥ 35 kg/m2 or family history of PE)8. The
performance of such an approach, which essentially
treats each risk factor as a separate screening test with
additive detection rate (DR) and screen-positive rate, and
the uptake of aspirin by the high-risk group, has not been
evaluated by prospective studies. An alternative approach
to screening for PE, which allows estimation of individual
patient-specific risks of PE requiring delivery before a
specified gestation, is to use Bayes’ theorem to combine
the a-priori risk from maternal characteristics and
medical history with the results of various combinations
of biophysical and biochemical measurements9–12. Exten-
sive research in the last decade has led to the identification
of four potentially useful biomarkers at 11–13 weeks’
gestation: mean arterial pressure (MAP), uterine artery
pulsatility index (UtA-PI), serum pregnancy-associated
plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) and serum placental growth
factor (PlGF)9–14.
The screening program for pre-eclampsia (SPREE)
study was designed to test the hypothesis that the
performance of first-trimester screening for PE by the
Bayes’ theorem-based method is superior to that defined
by the current NICE guidelines8.
METHODS
Study design and population
This was a prospective multicenter cohort study, carried
out in seven National Health Service (NHS) maternity
hospitals in England, of women recruited between 12
April 2016 and 15 December 2016.
Inclusion criteria for the study were: age ≥ 18 years, sin-
gleton pregnancy and live fetus at the 11–13-week scan.
Exclusion criteria were: women who were unconscious
or severely ill, those with learning difficulties or serious
mental illness, and major fetal abnormality identified at
the 11–13-week scan.
Approval
for
the
study
was
obtained
from
the
London–Surrey Borders Research Ethics Committee. The
study is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number
83611527
(http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN83611527).
Quality control of screening and verification of adherence
to protocol were performed by the University College Lon-
don Comprehensive Clinical Trials Unit (UCL-CCTU).
Procedures
All eligible women with singleton pregnancies attending
their routine hospital visit at 11 + 0 to 13 + 6 weeks’
gestation were given written information about the study
and those who agreed to participate provided written
informed consent.
Gestational age was determined from the measurement
of the fetal crown–rump length15. Maternal character-
istics and medical, obstetric and drug histories were
recorded, and maternal weight and height measured.
The MAP and UtA-PI were measured according to stan-
dardized protocols16,17; the measurements of MAP were
carried out by healthcare assistants or research sonogra-
phers and measurements of UtA-PI were performed by
research sonographers. Maternal serum concentrations of
PAPP-A and PlGF were measured using one of two auto-
mated devices (DELFIA® Xpress analyzer, PerkinElmer
Life and Analytical Sciences, Waltham, USA or BRAHMS
KRYPTOR™ analyzer, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hen-
nigsdorf, Germany). Quality control was applied to
achieve consistency of measurement of biomarkers across
different
hospitals
throughout
the
duration
of
the
study.
Risks
calculated
using
the
Bayes’
theorem-based
methods were not made available to the participants or
their clinicians. The decision concerning administration of
aspirin was made by the attending clinicians according to
routine standards of care at each site and the information
was recorded in the research database both at the time of
screening at 11–13 weeks and during collection of data
on pregnancy outcome.
All data on participant characteristics, biomarker
values and outcome from each site were reported to
UCL-CCTU. The data, blinded to outcome, were then
provided to the study statistician who (1) defined the
screen-positive group according to NICE criteria, (2)
computed risks for all-PE and preterm PE for the
prespecified combinations of biomarkers using the Bayes’
theorem-based method11,12, (3) identified the group
that was treated with aspirin (≥ 75 mg/day, starting at
< 14 weeks’ gestation and ending at ≥ 36 weeks or at
the time of earlier birth) and (4) examined associations
between
aspirin
treatment
and
baseline
covariates,
including
the
components
of
NICE
guidelines
and
biomarkers, before updating the statistical analysis plan
(SAP). When the SAP was finalized and UCL-CCTU
received and approved the file with fields of risks, NICE
criteria and aspirin treatment, they provided data on

pregnancy outcome for linking before the unblinded
analysis.
Diagnosis of PE
Data on pregnancy outcome were collected from the
hospital
maternity
records
or
the
general
medical
practitioners of the women. The obstetric records of
all women with pre-existing or pregnancy-associated
hypertension were examined to determine the diagnosis
of PE. This was based on the finding of hypertension
(systolic blood pressure of ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic
blood pressure of ≥ 90 mmHg on at least two occasions
4 h
apart,
developing
after
20 weeks’
gestation
in
previously normotensive women) and at least one of
the following: proteinuria (≥ 300 mg/24 h or protein
to creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/mmol or ≥ 2+ on dipstick
testing), renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 1.1 mg/dL
or two-fold increase in serum creatinine in the absence
of underlying renal disease), liver involvement (blood
concentration of transaminases to twice the normal
level),
neurological
complications
(e.g.
cerebral
or
visual
symptoms),
thrombocytopenia
(platelet
count
< 100 000/μL), or pulmonary edema18,19.
Outcome measures
The primary comparison was DR of screening recom-
mended by the NICE guidelines vs mini-combined test (a
Bayes’ theorem-based method involving maternal factors,
MAP and PAPP-A) in the prediction of PE occurring at
any gestational age (all-PE), after adjustment for the effect
of aspirin, for the same screen-positive rate determined
by the NICE method. This combination of biomarkers
was selected because the test can be introduced without
additional cost since all NHS maternity hospitals in Eng-
land offer first-trimester combined screening for trisomies
which includes measurement of PAPP-A.
Key secondary comparisons were DR of screening
recommended by the NICE guidelines vs three Bayes’
theorem-based methods (maternal factors, MAP and
PAPP-A; maternal factors, MAP and PlGF; and maternal
factors, MAP, UtA-PI and PlGF) in the prediction of
preterm PE. The combination of maternal factors and
PlGF was selected because PlGF can be measured in the
same sample and machines used in screening for trisomies
and previous studies found it to be more effective than
PAPP-A in the prediction of PE. The combination of
maternal factors, MAP, UtA-PI and PlGF was selected
because in previous studies it was found to be the most
effective method of screening.
Statistical analysis
We proposed to recruit 16 850 participants and, on the
assumption of a 5% no follow-up rate, there would be
16 000 for evaluation. On the extreme assumption that
90% of NICE screened-positive patients and 10% of
NICE screened-negative patients would be treated with
aspirin and that aspirin reduces the incidence of all-PE
by 50%, the power to detect a 10% difference in DR
between the NICE method and the mini-combined test
in the prediction of all-PE at the one-sided 2.5% level
would be > 80%.
We used McNemar’s test to compare the DR of the
NICE method with that of the Bayes’ theorem-based
method. However, since some of the women that
were screen positive according to NICE guidelines were
prescribed aspirin which could have reduced the risk of
PE, some of the patients in the screen-positive group
would have effectively been converted to false positives.
Consequently, treating NICE screen-positive women with
aspirin would reduce the DR and bias the McNemar’s
test against the NICE method. Our approach to dealing
with this was to apply multiple imputation to data on
the incidence of PE that would have occurred had it not
been for the effect of treatment. Markov chain Monte
Carlo was used to impute incidence data and generate 10
complete datasets for analysis20. Estimates of DR were
then pooled across data. We assumed that the incidence of
PE that would have occurred had it not been for the effect
of treatment was determined from a logistic regression
model dependent on NICE and center, and that aspirin
reduced the incidence with a prespecified probability of
0.3 for all-PE and 0.6 for preterm PE6. Although these
probabilities were based on the results of the ASPRE trial
in which the daily dose of aspirin was 150 mg, rather
than 75 mg as recommended by NICE guidelines8, we
wanted to avoid any potential criticism of bias against
the NICE method by assuming that the effect of 75 mg
was similar to that of higher doses of the drug. The
method of imputation and the choice of treatment effects
were prespecified and documented prior to receipt of the
outcome data.
Additional evaluation of performance of the Bayes’
theorem-based method involved estimation of detection
rates of PE, at fixed screen-positive rate of 10%, for
all 16 combinations of biomarkers. McNemar’s test was
applied to the effect of adding markers. No adjustments
were made for the effects of aspirin in this additional
evaluation.
Markov chain Monte Carlo was implemented using the
WinBUGS software21. The statistical software package R
was used for data analyses with the MICE package22,23
pooling estimates across the 10 complete datasets.

Intake of aspirin
Aspirin from <14 weeks to delivery or 36 weeks’ gestation
was taken by 749 (4.5%) of 16 747 in the study
population. The daily dose was 75 mg in 730 (97.5%)
and 150 mg in 19 (2.5%). Aspirin was taken by 400
(23.2%) women in the NICE screened-positive group
and 349 (2.3%) in the NICE screened-negative group.

DISCUSSION
Principal findings of this study
The study has demonstrated that screening for PE as
currently recommended by NICE guidelines identifies
only about 30% of pregnancies that would develop PE
and about 40% of those that will develop severe PE
leading to preterm birth, at a screen-positive rate of 10%.
Compliance with the NICE recommendation that women
at high risk for PE should be treated with aspirin from
the first trimester to the end of pregnancy was only 23%.
Such poor compliance may at least in part be attributed
to the generally held belief, based on the results of a
meta-analysis in 2007, that aspirin reduces the risk of PE
by only about 10%24.
The performance of screening by a combination of
maternal factors with biomarkers was far superior to
that of screening by NICE guidelines. At the same
screen-positive rate as for the NICE method, the DR

Strengths and limitations of this study
The strengths of the study include prospective exami-
nation of a large number of pregnant women in several
maternity units covering a wide spectrum of demographic
and racial characteristics. The results are therefore
likely to be generalizable across the UK. More than

participate in the study, measurements of all biomarkers
were recorded in all cases and complete follow-up was
obtained from > 98% of participants. Consistency in
data collection was maintained throughout the study
period by ensuring adequate training for all investigators
based on standardized protocols, regular UCL-CCTU
monitoring, and external validation and quality assurance
of biomarker measurements.
A
potential

of
the

is
lack
of
formal

assessment
concerning
the
implementation of combined screening for PE. Such
assessment was beyond the scope of this study but it
is currently being carried out.
Comparison with results of previous studies
The performance of screening for preterm PE by the Bayes’
theorem-based method, utilizing maternal factors, MAP,
UtA-PI and PlGF, observed in this study is compatible
with that reported in several previous studies of singleton
pregnancies at 11–13 weeks’ gestation. The algorithm was
developed originally from a study of 58 884 pregnancies;
the DR of preterm PE was 77% at false positive rate (FPR)
of 10%10. Subsequently, we used data from prospective
screening in 35 948 pregnancies to update the original
algorithm; the DR of preterm PE was 75% at FPR of
10%12. The diagnostic accuracy of this algorithm was
examined in a prospective multicenter study of 8775
pregnancies; the DR of preterm PE was 75% at FPR
of 10%26. In the screened population in the ASPRE
trial, involving 25 797 pregnancies from 13 maternity
hospitals in six countries, the DR of preterm PE, after
adjustment for the effect of aspirin, was 77% at FPR
of 9.2%27. None of these studies found evidence that
PAPP-A improved screening achieved by MAP, UtA-PI
and PlGF.

Implications for clinical practice
Recent evidence suggests that the target for first-trimester
screening should be severe PE leading to preterm birth,
rather than all-PE. There are two reasons for this suggested
change in clinical practice. First, aspirin is considerably
more effective than previously thought in reducing the
risk of preterm PE6,7. A recent meta-analysis reported
that aspirin reduces the risk of preterm PE by 67%,
provided that the daily dose of the drug is ≥ 100 mg and
the gestational age at onset of therapy is < 16 weeks7. In
the ASPRE trial, use of aspirin (150 mg/day) starting from
11–14 weeks reduced the risk of preterm PE by 62% and a
secondary analysis of the trial reported that the reduction
was even greater (75%) if the compliance was ≥ 90%6,25.
The second reason in favor of revising the NICE guide-
lines is the accumulating evidence that the performance of
first-trimester screening for preterm PE can be improved
substantially if the current method that relies on maternal
factors alone is modified to include the measurement of
biomarkers. SPREE has demonstrated that screening for
preterm PE by a combination of maternal factors, MAP,
UtA-PI and PlGF, rather than the NICE guidelines, can
double the detection rate, at the same screen-positive rate.
In the clinical implementation of the first-trimester
combined
test
for
preterm
PE,
recording
maternal
characteristics and medical history, measurement of
blood pressure and hospital attendance at 11–13 weeks’
gestation for an ultrasound scan are integral parts of
routine antenatal care. Measurement of UtA-PI can be
carried out by the same sonographers and ultrasound
machines used for the routine scan at 11–13 weeks’
gestation; however, the sonographers will require training
to carry out this test and the measurement would add
2–3 min to the current 20–30 min used for the scan.
Serum PlGF can be measured in the same blood sample
and by the same automated platforms that are currently
used for measurement of serum PAPP-A, as part of
routine clinical practice in screening for fetal trisomies
in all maternity hospitals in England; however, there is
an additional cost for the reagents. Extensive research
has established reference ranges for MAP, PlGF and
UtA-PI, described the maternal characteristics that affect
the measurements and developed the infrastructure for
auditing of results28–30. The software for estimation of
patient-specific risk for all-PE and preterm PE is accessible
freely (www.fetalmedicine.org).
A decade ago, effective first-trimester screening for fetal
trisomies was implemented in all maternity hospitals in the
UK within a few months of the appropriate decision being
taken by the National Screening Committee and NICE31.
The same infrastructure can now be used to expand the
aims of first-trimester screening to include identification
of women at high risk of developing preterm PE and
substantially reducing such risk through the prophylactic
use of the appropriate dose of aspirin32.
Conclusion
The SPREE study has demonstrated that the performance
of first-trimester screening for PE by a combination
of maternal factors and biomarkers is superior to that
achieved by the method recommended by the current
NICE guidelines.
