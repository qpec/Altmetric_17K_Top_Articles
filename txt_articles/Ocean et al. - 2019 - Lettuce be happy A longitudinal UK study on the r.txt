Rationale: While the role of diet in influencing physical health is now well-established, some recent research
suggests that increased consumption of fruits and vegetables could play a role in enhancing mental well-being. A
limitation with much of this existing research is its reliance on cross-sectional correlations, convenience samples,
and/or lack of adequate controls.
Objective: We aim to add to the emerging literature on the relationship between fruit and vegetable consumption
and well-being by using longitudinal data from a study in the United Kingdom (UK).
Method: We employ panel data analytical techniques on three waves collected between 2010 and 2017 (i.e.,
following the same individuals over time) in the UK Household Longitudinal Survey. We also control for time-
variant confounders such as diet, health, and lifestyle behaviours.
Results: Fixed effects regressions show that mental well-being (GHQ-12) responds in a dose-response fashion to
increases in both the quantity and the frequency of fruit and vegetables consumed. This relationship is robust to
the use of subjective well-being (life satisfaction) instead of mental well-being. We also document a hump-
shaped relationship between fruit and vegetable consumption and age.
Conclusion: Our findings provide further evidence that persuading people to consume more fruits and vegetables
may not only benefit their physical health in the long-run, but also their mental well-being in the short-run.
1. Introduction
A recent development in the well-being literature has been to show
that increased consumption of fruits and vegetables are positively as-
sociated with mental and subjective well-being. One of the first studies
in this area used large representative samples from the Welsh Health
Survey, the Scottish Health Survey, and the Health Survey of England to
demonstrate a positive association between fruit and vegetable con-
sumption and psychological well-being (Blanchflower et al., 2013).
More recently, Lalji et al. (2018) also used the Health Survey of England
to examine the association between fruit and vegetable consumption
and health. In comparison to Blanchflower et al. (2013) they examined
a much broader range of health outcomes such as blood pressure and
levels of cholesterol, in addition to psychological well-being. They
found that individuals who consumed three to four portions of fruit
daily reported better psychological well-being compared to those who
did not.
Further recent cross-sectional studies suggestive of a link between
fruit and vegetable consumption and well-being include Peltzer and
Pengpid (2017) and Sapranaviciute-Zabazlaieva et al. (2017). Respec-
tively, these studies found a positive link between fruit and vegetable
consumption and mental well-being amongst: university students across
28 countries; and for 45-72 year-olds living in Lithuania. A further
cross-sectional study found that the relationship is stronger for raw fruit
and vegetables than those consuming them cooked or canned (Brookie
et al., 2018). While all of these findings were robust to adjustment for a
large number of economic, social, and demographic variables, the main
limitation (as pointed out by the authors) is that confounding remains
possible when the data are cross-sectional.
An innovative psychology paper from the same year as the original
cross-sectional study by Blanchflower at al. goes some way to tackling
the potential bias from unobserved confounders. In this study a ‘daily
diary’ survey was undertaken with young adults (White et al., 2013):
Uniquely, the same individuals (n = 281) were followed over a period
of 21 consecutive days. Well-being was measured in terms of positive
and negative affect, rather than general health or life satisfaction. On a
day where positive affect was one point higher (on a 1 to 5 scale) for an
individual, that individual reported consuming 0.112 more portions of

 fruit (p = 0.002) and 0.147 more portions of vegetables (p < 0.001).
In addition, using lagged variables revealed that fruit and vegetable
consumption predicts positive affect the following day, but positive
affect did not predict fruit and vegetable consumption. This is important
as it suggests fruit and vegetable consumption leads to higher well-
being, but higher well-being does not lead to higher fruit and vegetable
consumption.
A subsequent study with a similar design (Conner et al., 2015) found
that fruit and vegetable consumption also positively predicts eu-
daimonic well-being (i.e., engagement, purpose, and meaning), crea-
tivity, and curiosity. Whereas the studies by White et al. (2013) and
Conner et al. (2015) were able to track the same individuals over time
(which is advantageous when it comes to establishing causality), they
utilised a convenience sample consisting of psychology students, which
is small in number relative to Blanchflower et al. (2013). The cross-
sectional and diary approaches taken together do, however, strongly
support the suggestion that diet could be an important factor when it
comes to explaining variation in well-being.
A significant step towards demonstrating the causality of this re-
lationship came from a randomised control trial by Conner et al.
(2017), and a panel data analysis by Mujcic and Oswald (2016). Conner
et al. (2017) found that various psychological outcomes improved sig-
nificantly in a treatment group which provided young adults two ad-
ditional portions of fruit and vegetables a day over a two-week period.
Though this study provided an important step towards establishing
causality, it is limited by a relatively small sample of 171 18-25 year-
olds, and a short time frame (two weeks).
Mujcic and Oswald (2016) used individual level panel data - namely
the nationally representative and longitudinal Household, Income, and
Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey – to examine the re-
lationship between fruit and vegetable consumption and subjective
well-being. The unique feature of this dataset, relative to the cross-
sectional work described above, is that the same individuals could be
tracked between two points in time. Using individual level fixed-effects,
Mujcic and Oswald (2016) found that the average number of fruit and
vegetable portions consumed in one day positively and significantly
predicts life satisfaction, as well as an alternative happiness measure.
What is particularly surprising is that this relationship appears to be
fairly linear and monotonically increasing. In other words, the benefits
from increased daily fruit and vegetable consumption do not appear to
diminish, even when consumption is in excess of the five portions per
day often recommended in a number of developed countries (including
the UK, US, and Japan).
This study aims to build on this research which is suggestive of a
positive relationship between fruit and vegetable consumption and
well-being. We use a similar panel-data estimation approach to Mujcic
and Oswald (2016), with two main differences. First, we use data from
a much larger representative longitudinal survey in the UK, namely the
UK Household Longitudinal Survey (UKHLS). Similarly to Mujcic and
Oswald (2016), the structure of this survey allows us to examine the
relationship between daily variation in the consumption of fruit and
vegetables and well-being, but we are also able to ascertain estimated
effects for fruit and vegetable consumption separately when it comes to
frequency of consumption, i.e., how many days in a week an individual
typically consumes fruits and vegetables. Second, as well as using a
standard subjective life satisfaction measure (similar to the one used by
Mujcic and Oswald, 2016), we also use a measure of ‘mental well-
being’: the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). This
measure, aside from being finer-grained, is also more relevant in cap-
turing changes in mental health and thus perhaps better suited for in-
forming public health policymakers. Finally, we also examine to what
extent fruit and vegetable consumption in the UK varies along socio-
demographic lines.
The key advantage associated with the longitudinal nature of our
dataset (and the one used by Mujcic and Oswald) is that we can relate
changes in fruit and vegetable consumption to changes in self-reported
well-being for the same individual over time (fixed-effects). Doing so
helps ensure that any observed relationship is not the result of a spur-
ious cross-sectional pattern caused by the potentially pernicious effect
of time-invariant omitted confounders such as personality traits or fa-
mily upbringing. In addition to controlling for the standard set of socio-
demographic variables, we also control for a variety of time-variant
confounders reflective of health, diet and lifestyle behaviours that could
plausibly bias any estimates relating to the relationship between fruit
and vegetable consumption and well-being.
Using two separate indicators, our results strongly suggest that fruit
and vegetable consumption can enhance well-being. Specifically, using
the General Health Questionnaire and self-reported life satisfaction as
our indicators, we find that well-being rises in an approximately dose-
response way with both the number of portions of fruits and vegetables
consumed, and the number of days in a given week an individual
consumes either fruits or vegetables. Our findings, therefore, provide
further evidence that persuading or incentivising people to consume
more fruits and vegetables may not only benefit their physical health in
the long run, but also their mental well-being in the short run.
2. Methods
In order to examine the relationship between well-being and the
consumption of fruit and vegetables, we draw upon the UK Household
Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) – also known as ‘Understanding Society’.
The UKHLS contains information from approximately 50,000 in-
dividuals and is the replacement for the older British Household Panel
Survey (BHPS). Data for ‘mainstage waves’ 1–7 were collected from
2009 to 2017.
Households recruited in the first wave from a general population
sample across the whole of the UK were visited annually, and re-
sponded either via online survey or a face-to-face home interview
conducted by a trained interviewer. This mixed mode of response is
designed to increase response rates. Household response rates for the
three waves (2, 5, and 7) used in this study are 76.2%, 83.8%, and
81.5%
(understandingsociety.ac.uk/sites/default/files/downloads/
documentation/mainstage/user-guides/mainstage-waves-1-7-user-
guide.pdf, last accessed on 11th Sep 2018). Respondents of the main
survey are household members aged 15 or over (individuals between 10
and 15 complete a separate youth questionnaire). Not all questions
(such as those relating to fruit and vegetable consumption) are asked
each year, in order to lessen the burden on participants.
2.1. Variables
We identified three questions on fruit and vegetable consumption
that allow us to estimate the impact of both quantity and frequency. In
order to measure quantity, we analysed responses to the following
question: “On a day when you eat fruit or vegetables, how many por-
tions of fruit and vegetables in total do you usually eat?” The size of a
portion is defined as being equal to: one cup of raw vegetables (or the
size of a fist), half a cup of cooked vegetables or chopped fruit, or one
piece of fruit. Individuals were also shown pictures to help define
portion size. In order to measure frequency, two separate questions
asked respondents how often they consumed fruit and how often they
consumed vegetables in a usual week. Both of these items were mea-
sured categorically, with four categories: Never; 1–3 days per week; 4–6
days per week; Every day.
Data on the number of fruit and vegetable portions consumed on a
typical day where there is non-zero consumption of fruit and vegetables
is available in Waves 2 and 5 of the UKHLS, while observations on the
frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption in a typical week were
available in Waves 2, 5, and 7. Data for Wave 2 were collected between
Jan 2010 and June 2012; Wave 5 was collected between Jan 2013 and
June 2015; and Wave 7 was collected between Jan 2015 and June
2017. Unlike Mujcic and Oswald (2016), we chose not to combine the
N. Ocean et al.

336
 frequency and quantity measures into one estimate of average daily
fruit and vegetable consumption, and instead kept them separate. Doing
so allowed us to separate frequency and quantity effects, and also to
exploit the additional wave of data for frequency effects. The data,
therefore, enable us to measure quantity effects between two time
points spanning three years, and frequency effects across three time
points spanning five years.
Our main outcome variable is mental well-being, measured using
the GHQ-12. The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) measure was
conceived as a screening instrument for psychiatric disorders (e.g., see
Goldberg and Hillier, 1979), but is also used as a general measure of
mental well-being. The GHQ-12 is a shortened version of the original
GHQ, which consists of 60 items instead of 12. The original 60-item
GHQ measure is still used when more intensive examination is required
on smaller numbers of individuals. The items of the GHQ-12 encompass
aspects of hedonic well-being (feeling happy or depressed), eudaimonic
well-being (purpose and self-worth), and anxiety (worry and strain).
Each item is scored on a four-point Likert scale, whose options are
coded from 0 to 3. Therefore, the GHQ-12 score ranges from 0 (best
well-being) to 36 (worst well-being). For ease of interpretation, we
reversed this variable so that individuals are scored from 0 (worst) to 36
(best). In the regression tables that follow, we labelled this variable as
‘reversed GHQ-12’. Therefore, a higher level of reversed GHQ-12 corre-
sponds to a higher level of mental well-being. As a useful robustness
check, we also used an alternative measure of subjective well-being as
an outcome variable, namely self-reported life satisfaction.
Based on prior research, we included a rich set of commonly ob-
served predictors of well-being as control variables (see Dolan et al.,
2008 for a review of this literature). These include socio-demographic
variables such as age, household income, gender, relationship status,
number of children and education. Such controls are important as it is
possible that fruit and vegetable consumption would co-vary with, for
example, income – someone becoming richer and as a result enjoying
higher well-being scores and changing their food related behaviours.
We also controlled for the presence of long-standing health conditions
as well as health and lifestyle related behaviours such as walking fre-
quency and smoking behaviour – again potential confounders that
could bias any estimates of the relationship between fruit and vegetable
consumption and well-being. Long-standing health conditions were
measured by responses to the following question: “Do you have any long-
standing physical or mental impairment, illness, or disability? By 'long-
standing' I mean anything that has troubled you over a period of at least 12
months or that is likely to trouble you over a period of at least 12 months.”
Walking frequency was measured in terms of the number of days on
which an individual walked continuously for 10 min or more in the last
4 weeks.
Finally, we added other controls reflective of food related beha-
viours, namely the type of bread and milk consumed by individuals.
The type of bread eaten most frequently could be either: white;
wholemeal; granary or wholegrain; other brown; both brown and
white; other; or none. The type of milk usually consumed could be ei-
ther: whole; semi-skimmed; skimmed; soya; other; or none. These serve
as useful proxy variables for overall dietary patterns. That is, someone
consuming semi-skimmed milk or wholegrain bread may be more
conscious of diet than someone consuming full fat milk or regular white
bread.
2.2. Estimation strategy
Our main regression analysis seeks to estimate the relationship be-
tween the quantity of fruit and vegetable portions consumed (on a day
where at least one portion is consumed) and mental well-being, as
captured by our reversed GHQ-12 measure. Specifically, we estimated

12), vt is the time (wave) dummy, and
it is an idiosyncratic error term.
FV
it is our key explanatory variable, which reflects daily levels of fruit
and vegetable consumption. The vector Xit is a standard set of socio-
demographic control variables that might be correlated with individual
well-being (e.g., income, age, education, labour force status, relation-
ship status etc.). Eit captures other lifestyle behaviours that could be
related with both well-being and fruit and vegetable consumption (e.g.,
exercise measured by walking frequency, other dietary habits, and
smoking behaviour). Hit captures whether individuals have a long-
standing health condition. Finally, ai represents the individual fixed-
effect, which controls for any time-invariant unobserved confounders
(e.g., personality traits and differences in family upbringing).
In addition to examining the relationship between the number of
fruit and vegetable portions consumed on a day that an individual
consumes some fruit and vegetables, and mental well-being, we esti-
mated a reduced-form model where we explore the relationship be-
tween the frequency (i.e., number of days) with which fruits and ve-
getables separately are consumed in a typical week and mental well-
being. For this analysis, we were able to exploit three waves of data. It
is a reduced form model, as some of our controls (e.g., exercise and
smoking behaviour) were not available across all three waves. They
were therefore excluded from this part of the analysis.
The outcome variable used in these analyses is mental well-being,
measured by reversed GHQ-12. As an additional robustness check, we
repeated these analyses using a self-reported measure of life satisfaction
as the dependent variable. This was reported on a 7-point Likert scale
ranging from ‘completely dissatisfied’ to ‘completely satisfied’. We used
this alternative measure because such self-reported life satisfaction
measures are commonly used in the literature, and so we thought it
would be a useful exercise to check whether the overall qualitative
interpretation of our main results is sensitive to the well-being measure
used.
3. Results
Our results are split into three main sections. We first provide some
descriptive statistics relating to the extent to which fruit and vegetable
consumption varies according to socio-demographic characteristics.
Second, we present the results of our main fixed-effects analysis, which
examines the relationship between fruit and vegetable consumption
and mental well-being as captured by reversed GHQ-12. Third, as a ro-
bustness check, we examine whether our main results are sensitive to
an alternative metric of well-being (namely self-reported life satisfac-
tion).
3.1. Descriptive statistics
Fig. 1 shows the number of fruit and vegetable portions consumed in
a day when there is a non-zero level of consumption (our quantity
measure), that is, on a day when fruits and/or vegetables are consumed.
An interesting observation is that the majority of people consume fewer
than the often recommended five portions of fruit and vegetables a day,
since 78% (n = 90,448) consume fewer than five portions on a day
where at least one portion is consumed, and not everyone consumes at
least one portion every day (Fig. 2). The UK Department of Health in-
troduced the ‘five-a-day’ campaign in 2003 following mounting evi-
dence from health research, and a recommendation from the World
Health Organization to consume a minimum of 400 g of fruit and ve-
getables per day to prevent chronic disease and micronutrient defi-
ciencies (http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/fruit/en/ last ac-
cessed on 3rd July 2018). Similar campaigns have been adopted in
other major developed countries. Given the tendency for people to over-
report perceived good behaviours in household surveys (see Lusk and
Norwood, 2009a,b), it seems likely that these figures represent an upper
bound when it comes to the proportion of the population who regularly
N. Ocean et al.
Social Science & Medicine 222 (2019) 335–345
337
 consume five portions of fruits and vegetables per day. This trend is
broadly consistent with the findings from Australia by Mujcic and
Oswald (2016), who report that 85% of respondents consumed fewer
than 3 daily portions of fruit, and 60% consumed fewer than 3 daily
portions of vegetables (though a direct comparison is not possible due
to a difference in our measures of the quantity of fruit and vegetable
consumption). 90 people consumed 11 or more portions of fruit and
vegetables on a day where at least one portion was consumed. We re-
coded the data for the subsequent regression analysis, so that anyone
consuming greater than 11 portions is assigned a value of 11. Recoding
does not change the results of our analyses.
Fig. 2 shows the frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption in a
usual week: 50% of people consume at least one portion of vegetables
daily, and 46% of people consume at least one portion of fruit daily.
Somewhat surprisingly, therefore, there is a fairly large proportion of
people who go one day or more than a week consuming either no fruit,
or no vegetables. 9310 individuals (7%) report never consuming fruit,
and 2710 individuals (2%) report never consuming vegetables in a
usual week.
3.1.1. Income
Here, we examine to what extent fruit and vegetable consumption
differs according to three main socio-demographic characteristics. First,
we separate individuals into income quartiles based on their household
income in the month before the survey interview. Mean monthly
household income in the sample is £3380 and median monthly
household income is £2744. Fig. 3 shows graphs of portions consumed
per day separated by income quartile. In general, the consumption
distribution is quite similar across quartiles, albeit we do observe some
income differences, that is, the higher the income quartile, the lower
the proportion of individuals that consume less than the recommended
five portions on a day where at least one portion is consumed (81%,
79%, 78%, and 75% for quartiles 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively). A broadly
similar pattern emerges for the frequency of consumption, in that we
observe that those in the highest income quartile have a somewhat
higher frequency of consumption than those in the lower income
quartiles (Fig. 4). Again, the differences across income groups are not
very substantive.
In short, as Figs. 3 and 4 illustrate, those in the highest income
quartile as a whole consume more fruits and vegetables than those in
the lower income groups. These differences across the income dis-
tribution are, however, not very substantive; and in general terms, the
percentage of individuals who do not consume five portions of fruits
and vegetables (on a day where at least one portion is consumed) is
high across the board. This suggests that being unable to afford fruits
and vegetables in large quantities is perhaps not the main reason that
levels of consumption are below recommended guidelines for the ma-
jority of the population. It is worth noting that a recent study has
suggested that the scarcity of time can act independently to the scarcity
of income in predicting poor eating habits (Venn and Strazdins, 2017),
and therefore it could also be a factor in these data.
3.1.2. Age
Next, we look at the differences in fruit and vegetable consumption
across age. The mean age in our overall sample is 47.1 (min = 15, max
= 104). Grouping the data into age bands based on 5 approximate
quintiles, we find that approximately: 87% of 15–29 year-olds; 80% of
30–41 year-olds; 77% of 42–52 year-olds; 73% of 53–65 year-olds; and
74% those aged 66 and above consume fewer than the recommended
five portions a day (on a day where there is non-zero consumption). In
other words, up until approximately the age of retirement, an upward
trend is evident when it comes to consumption of fruits and vegetables.
Closer inspection of the data in the oldest age group reveals an in-
creasing proportion of people consuming fewer than five-a-day, on a
day where at least one portion is consumed. For example, the propor-
tion is 71% for 66-75 year-olds, but rises to 77% for 76-85 year-olds,
and 84% for those aged 86 or above. This is in contrast to the falling
proportion of individuals consuming fewer than five-a-day observed up
until the age of 65. Suspecting a non-linear relationship, we plotted a

one portion is consumed (n = 90,448).

 fitted quadratic function to the raw data on the number of fruit and
vegetable portions consumed (illustrated in Fig. 5). Looking at this
figure, we can see that there appears to be a hump-shaped relationship
between age and the quantity of fruits and vegetables consumed (on a
day where at least one portion is consumed). The maximum con-
sumption of an average 3.52 portions per positive consumption day is
achieved at age 64, which is just before the normal state pension age in
the UK (this age is currently variable between 65 and 68 depending on
sex and birth year). While the quantity of fruit and vegetable con-
sumption is rising slowly up to this point (i.e., people generally appear
to be increasing the number of portions of fruits and vegetables they
consume as they age), beyond the age of 64 we can see that the con-
sumption of fruit and vegetables begins to fall. One potential explana-
tion is that retirement leads to a reduced calorie intake because of lower
activity levels and this reduced calorie intake, in turn, leads to a re-
duction in the quantity of fruits and vegetables consumed (on a day
with positive consumption).
While the quantity of fruit and vegetables consumed starts to fall at
retirement age, the frequency with which individuals consume fruit
and/or vegetables continues to rise (Fig. 6). For example, the propor-
tion of people eating at least one portion every day is increasing in age
up until after the age of approximately 80. After the age of 80, whereas
the proportion consuming one portion of fruit every day continues to
increase, the proportion consuming one portion of vegetables every day
levels off. One potential explanation for these seemingly contradictory
findings is that individuals are simply more concerned about their
health as they age (i.e., they consume more portions of fruit and ve-
getables and more frequently). However, upon retirement, the actual
number of portions of fruit and vegetables consumed (on a day with a
positive level of consumption) starts to decline as a result of not
working (for example, due to a reduction in the overall number of
calories expended). It is also possible that increasing health-related
concerns surrounding the appropriate number of calories to consume
could also play a role in reducing the number of portions consumed. We
cannot, however, rule out other explanations such as cohort effects due
to differences in upbringing and environment between generations.
3.1.3. Sex
Finally, we separate fruit and vegetable consumption by sex. Fig. 7
shows the differences in consumption (on days where at least one
portion is consumed) between men and women. In keeping with pre-
vious research (e.g., see Lange et al., 2018), females eat significantly
more portions of fruit and vegetables per positive consumption day
(mean for females = 3.43; mean for males = 3.13; p < 0.00005). They
also consume both fruits and vegetables more frequently throughout
the week (Fig. 8).
There are two main ways to interpret these data. It is certainly
plausible that women consume more fruits and vegetables than men in
general. Previous research has found that women are more likely to be
vegetarian, and more likely to be morally opposed to eating meat
(Beardsworth et al., 2002; Ruby, 2012). Therefore, it is conceivable that
female diets are more reliant on plant-based nutrition than male diets,
which would support the suggestion that females have a higher level of
fruit and vegetable consumption than males. However, we note that
social desirability (the tendency to report differently based on what
appears more desirable to others) is generally found to be higher in
women. It has specifically been shown to bias dietary responses of
women, but not men (Hebert et al., 1995, 1997). Hence, an alternative
explanation is that women are simply over-reporting their consumption
of fruit and vegetables.
3.1.4. Socio-demographic regression
In Table A1, we present the results of a pooled cross-sectional model
with fruit and vegetable consumption (on a day where at least one
portion was consumed) as the dependent variable, and socio-demo-
graphic characteristics as our explanatory variables. The descriptive
patterns described above hold in this analysis. Table A1 shows that the
coefficient on age is positive (p < 0.001), whereas the coefficient for
age-squared
is
negative
(p < 0.001),
indicating
a
hump-shaped

fruit, n = 130,447 for vegetables).

 relationship between age and the quantity of fruit and vegetables
consumed. The coefficient for income attracts a positive and statisti-
cally significant coefficient (p < 0.001). Finally, we can see that fe-
males have a significantly higher level of consumption than males
(p < 0.001). These relationships are robust to the addition of controls
for education, employment, lifestyle and health, and the consumption

3.2. Regression analysis: GHQ-12
Our main results focus on the use of reversed GHQ-12 as the measure
of individuals' mental well-being. The key independent variable of in-
terest is fruit and vegetables (the quantity of portions of fruits and/or
vegetables on a typical day when consumption is non-zero). We first
estimated a simple pooled OLS model, that is, a cross-sectional re-
gression pooling data from multiple waves and treating them as distinct
individuals. Fruit and vegetables attracts a positive and statistically sig-
nificant coefficient in our pooled cross-sectional OLS model. In other
words, as the quantity of fruit and vegetables consumed increases, then
so too does well-being. Further details of these results appear in the
appendix (Table A2).
Table 1 presents our main regression results for the full sample
population in Britain, consisting of individual observations spread
across two waves of the UKHLS. Here, instead of using a pooled cross-
sectional model, we take advantage of the panel nature of the dataset by
using individual fixed-effects, thereby controlling for any potential bias
due to time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity (e.g., personality traits
and family upbringing). In specification (1), a basic fixed effects re-
gression of mental well-being on only fruits and vegetables, we see that
fruit and vegetables attracts a statistically significant and positive

 coefficient. This suggests that when individuals increase their fruit and
vegetable consumption, their mental well-being rises. In specification
(2), we see that this coefficient remains relatively stable after control-
ling for standard socio-demographic variables. The coefficient in our
fixed-effects specification is somewhat smaller than in our pooled cross-
sectional model (Table A2), which suggests that, notwithstanding the
standard set of socio-demographic controls, reliance on a cross-sec-
tional model may place an upward bias on estimates of the relationship
between fruit and vegetable consumption and well-being.
Specification (3) in Table 1 adds an additional set of covariates
related to health and lifestyle behaviours. This includes type of dairy
consumption, type of bread consumption, smoking status, walking

Notes: The four fixed-effects regressions in this table assess the impact of within-person changes in fruit and vegetable consumption on mental well-being, as
measured by the reversed GHQ-12. (1) includes only a measure of the number of portions consumed on a day where at least one portion is consumed. (2) and (3) add
variables for demographics, lifestyle/health, and consumption of bread/dairy. These three regressions use Waves 2 and 5 of the UKHLS. (4) uses the general form of
(2), but measures fruit consumption frequency and vegetable consumption frequency across three Waves (2, 5, and 7). Additional controls on lifestyle/health and
consumption of other foods were not available for all three Waves. All models show significant positive relationships between fruit and vegetable consumption, and
mental well-being.

 frequency (the number of days over the last 4 weeks that individuals
had completed a continuous walk lasting at least 10 min), and the
presence of a long-standing health condition. These additional controls
have the expected relationship with mental well-being. Specifically, we
first observe a positive and significant association between walking
frequency and well-being, which is in keeping with previous research
on the benefits of physical activity on mental/psychological well-being
(Scully et al., 1998; Fox, 1999; Penedo and Dahn, 2005). Second, we
observe a negative and statistically significant relationship between
smoking status and subjective well-being, which is also in keeping with
previous work (e.g., Kahneman and Deaton, 2010; Shahab and West,
2012).
In relation to health status, we find as expected that individuals with
a long-standing health condition report a significantly lower level of
well-being than those without a long-standing health condition. As a
robustness check, we also ran specification (3) with ‘long-standing
health condition’ replaced by ‘general health,’ which is measured on a
five-point scale ranging from poor to excellent. Our results relating to the
relationship between fruit and vegetable consumption and well-being
were robust to this alternative measure of health (results are available
on request).
We observed no significant relationship between the type of bread
or milk consumed and mental well-being. Apart from their use as proxy
variables to capture other diet related health behaviours, their lack of
statistical significance can be seen as adding further weight to our ar-
gument that fruit and vegetable consumption can foster mental well-
being. That is, there appears to be something inherent in fruit and ve-
getables, as opposed to other food groups such as bread and milk, that
positively influences individuals' well-being.
Looking at our preferred fixed-effects specification (3), we find that
increasing one's consumption of fruit and vegetables by one portion (on
a day where at least one portion is consumed) leads to a 0.133-unit
increase in mental well-being (p < 0.01). The question remains: how
large is this effect in practical terms? One way to gain an understanding
of this issue is to compare the estimated change in mental well-being
from increases in fruit and vegetable consumption to that of other
commonly observed correlates with well-being. A five-portion increase
in the number of fruits and vegetables consumed (on a day with positive
consumption) would be associated with a 0.67-unit increase in mental
well-being. From the coefficients in Table 1, we can see that this would
be approximately equivalent in magnitude to the estimated well-being
loss from widowhood (−0.68), and approximately one third of the
estimated impact from unemployment, which is known to have one of
the largest effects on subjective well-being (Clark and Oswald, 1994;
Oswald, 1997; Di
Tella et al., 2001; Frey and Stutzer, 2002;
Blanchflower and Oswald, 2004; Dolan et al., 2008). In terms of a factor
that is more controllable at the individual level, our results show that
increasing one's daily consumption by one portion (on a day with po-
sitive consumption) provides the same estimated increase in mental
well-being as 7.6 additional days of walking continuously for at least
10 min per 4 weeks.
While the preceding analysis examined the impact of the quantity of
fruits and vegetables consumed on mental well-being, we are also able
to examine the relationship between well-being and the frequency of
fruit and vegetable consumption in a typical week. Specification (4) in
Table 1 utilises the three waves of data that are available on frequency
of fruit and vegetable consumption, and estimates the effects of both
fruit consumption frequency and vegetable consumption frequency on
mental well-being, including the socio-demographic controls from
specification (2). As explained in the Method section, lifestyle and
health variables were only present in two of the three waves of the
UKHLS we use in this study. Therefore, in order to enable us to utilise
the additional explanatory power of using three separate time points to
examine variation within individuals, these variables were omitted in
specification (4). Using specification (4), we find a monotonically in-
creasing relationship: That is, the more often fruits and vegetables are
consumed in a week, the higher mental well-being is likely to be. It is
also notable that the effect of eating vegetables more often is somewhat
larger than the estimated effect of eating fruit more often. The corre-
lation between fruit consumption frequency and vegetable consumption
frequency is 0.41. However, coefficient estimates remain relatively
stable when including only a single measure of frequency (i.e., either
fruit frequency or vegetable frequency) in the regression.
The estimated effects of increasing the frequency of fruit and/or
vegetables consumed on mental well-being are comparable to that of
many impactful life events. Two relative comparisons paint a telling
picture. If an individual who consumed vegetables daily stopped con-
suming them altogether, they would suffer a greater estimated loss in
mental well-being than becoming widowed, or approximately 57% of
the loss of someone who went from being employed to being un-
employed. One note of caution with this comparison is that we cannot
say that this is a pure frequency effect – an individual may have both
increased their frequency and quantity of consumption simultaneously.
3.3. Robustness check: life satisfaction
As a robustness check for our main results using mental well-being
(reversed GHQ-12), we repeated our analyses from Table 1 using self-
reported life satisfaction as the dependent variable. To measure life
satisfaction, respondents were shown the following statement: “(Please
choose the number which you feel best describes how dissatisfied or satisfied
you are with the following aspects of your current situation.) Your life
overall.” Responses were scored on a 7-point scale, where one means
‘completely dissatisfied’ and seven means ‘completely satisfied’. The
results from this secondary set of analyses are in Table 2. Overall, the
results paint a similar picture to those obtained when using reversed
GHQ-12 as the outcome variable for well-being. That is, the quantity
and frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption both have a sig-
nificant and positive relationship with life satisfaction.
In our preferred fixed-effects specification (3), the presence of a
long-standing health condition generates a loss in life satisfaction
equivalent to consuming 5.3 fewer portions of fruit and vegetables a
day (on a day when there is non-zero consumption). Increasing con-
sumption by one portion on a day when at least one portion is con-
sumed increases life satisfaction by as much as walking continuously for
at least 10 min on 5.4 additional days per 4 weeks. Finally, increasing
the frequency of vegetable consumption from never to 4–6 days per
week generates approximately the same estimated increase in life sa-
tisfaction as being married, whereas moving in the opposite direction
(reducing consumption from 4 to 6 days per week to never) generates
approximately the same estimated loss in life satisfaction as being wi-
dowed.
4. Discussion
This study contributes to the relatively new line of literature as-
sessing the impact of fruit and vegetable consumption on well-being by
being the first to analyse this relationship using the UK Understanding
Society longitudinal dataset. One additional novel feature of our work is
that we illustrate how the frequency with which fruits and vegetables
are consumed are as important, if not more so, than actual quantity of
consumption. To the best of our knowledge, this study is also the first to
show a significant non-linear relationship between age and fruit and
vegetable consumption.
Using fixed-effects analysis on over 45,000 individuals followed
over time, we find that well-being increases in a dose-response fashion
with the number of portions of fruit and vegetables consumed (on a day
where there is non-zero consumption of fruit and vegetables) or with
the number of days in which either fruits or vegetables are consumed in
a given week. This finding is robust to the measure of well-being used
(reversed GHQ-12 and life satisfaction).
The importance of better understanding ways to improve mental

 health is an issue that has gained increasing prominence among public
health professionals in the Western world. Specifically, there is a rea-
lisation of the importance of not just physical but also mental and
subjective well-being. Apart from being significant in a statistical sense,
our estimates suggest that even modest increases in the consumption of
fruit and vegetables may have substantive positive effects on well-
being. Therefore, when it comes to improving mental health, policies
aimed at increasing fruit and vegetable consumption among the general
population may provide a relatively low-cost public health intervention
that supplements current approaches (generally involving pharmaceu-
ticals and/or cognitive behavioural therapy).
It is worth noting at this stage that our life satisfaction estimates are
broadly similar to those reported by Mujcic and Oswald (2016) using
data from Australia. Given that our measure of fruit and vegetable

 consumption pertains to levels of consumption on a day when in-
dividuals eat at least one portion, as opposed to average daily levels per
say, our estimates cannot be directly compared. However, there is a
degree of similarity between our estimates of the well-being gains (as
captured by life satisfaction) from increasing fruit and vegetable con-
sumption, and those reported by Mujcic and Oswald (2016). Their es-
timates suggest, for example, that an increase in fruit and vegetable
portions by eight per day would lead to the same average estimated life
satisfaction gain as moving from unemployment to employment. Our
findings suggest that moving from unemployment to employment has
an equivalent effect on life satisfaction as increasing consumption of
fruits and vegetables by approximately 10.5 portions per day on a ty-
pical day where some fruits and vegetables are consumed.
4.1. Limitations and considerations for future research
Future research is needed to help deal with the vexed issue of
causality. That being said, it is important to note that our use of panel
data coupled with a large representative survey and a detailed set of
controls
does,
at
least
in
part,
address
endogeneity
concerns.
Specifically, our approach helps ensure that any observed relationship
between fruit and vegetable consumption and well-being is not merely
a spurious cross-sectional pattern caused by omitted confounding
variables such as personality traits, health related behaviours, or family
upbringing. While it seems more likely that fruit and vegetable con-
sumption increases subjective well-being, we recognise that the reverse
may also be possible, at least to some extent, and it would place an
upward bias on our estimates. Conversely, relying on self-reported
measures of fruit and vegetable intake will inevitably introduce some
measurement error, a factor that would typically bias our estimates
downwards. We therefore suggest that additional research using long-
itudinal data (as used in our study) is still needed, but is also supple-
mented with randomised control trials (RCTs) and/or quasi-experi-
mental methods (e.g., instrumental variable modelling) designed to
explore the impact of different kinds of diets on well-being. An in-
strumental variable strategy would require identification of a variable
strongly related to fruit and vegetable consumption, but not well-being.
RCTs will likely require government involvement, but the rewards from
such research promise great potential savings in terms of public ex-
penditure on improving mental well-being.
Further research on the mechanisms in which these effects take
place is also warranted. The epidemiological literature points to a
number of potential mechanisms supportive of a positive relationship
between fruit and vegetable consumption and subjective well-being,
but the potential pathways are still poorly understood. Some possible
mechanisms here include the role of vitamins for subjective well-being
(see Kaplan et al., 2007 for a review). For example, the antioxidant
properties in vitamin C and E have been shown to help manage the
body's level of oxidative stress and lower inflammatory markers which
have been associated with the onset of depressive mood (Berk et al.,
2013; Rooney et al., 2013). B-vitamins play an essential role in main-
taining mitochondrial function and mitochondrial dysfunction is asso-
ciated with stress, anxiety, and social subordination (Chakravarty et al.,
2013; Depeint et al., 2006; Einat et al., 2005; Hollis et al., 2015). Fruits
and vegetables tend to be carbohydrate dense and there is some re-
search to suggest that the positive effects of fruit and vegetable con-
sumption could also be partly due to increased carbohydrate intake, as
carbohydrate-rich foods increase concentrations of brain serotonin
(Blundell et al., 1995; Takeda et al., 2004). It is also possible that not all
carbohydrates affect well-being in the same fashion (White et al.,
2013). Complex carbohydrates found in fruits and vegetables may en-
hance positive affect, whereas refined sucrose more commonly found in
sweets and sugary soft drinks may worsen mood (Christensen and
Burrows, 1990; Reid et al., 2010).
An alternative mechanism relies on substitution effects. Given that
there is an upper bound to the number of calories an individual can
comfortably consume per day, consuming more fruits and vegetables
may result in reduced consumption of other food groups that may be
detrimental to well-being. We suggest that future survey designs in-
clude measures for the consumption of other foods (e.g., meat, sweets,
sugary drinks), as well as overall calories consumed. This would enable
us to further disentangle the intrinsic well-being benefits of fruits and
vegetables from substitution effects.
5. Conclusions
In conclusion, our study using panel data from the UK suggests that
mental well-being responds in a dose-response fashion to increases in
both the quantity and the frequency of fruits and vegetables consumed.
These findings in turn could have important implications for public
health practitioners, especially given the low rate of adherence to the
national ‘five-a-day’ guidelines, as it suggests that even modest changes
in the consumption patterns of individuals may translate into sub-
stantive positive effects for the well-being of large cohorts of the po-
pulation. The relatively low rate of adherence to recommended guide-
lines points to the importance of further behavioural orientated
research investigating how individuals make decisions about their diet,
in order to help us understand how best to encourage higher levels of
fruit and vegetable consumption. It is of course possible (if not likely)
that by simply communicating the potential mental well-being benefits
in addition to physical health benefits, one may be able to increase fruit
and vegetable consumption. This strategy may be particularly effective
due to the fact that positive effects for mental well-being accrue rela-
tively rapidly, whereas the benefits in terms of physical health accrue in
the medium to long-term.
