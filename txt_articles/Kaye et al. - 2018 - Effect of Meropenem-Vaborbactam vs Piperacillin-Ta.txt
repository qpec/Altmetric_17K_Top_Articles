IMPORTANCE Meropenem-vaborbactam is a combination carbapenem/beta-lactamase
inhibitor and a potential treatment for severe drug-resistant gram-negative infections.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate efficacy and adverse events of meropenem-vaborbactam in
complicated urinary tract infection (UTI), including acute pyelonephritis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Phase 3, multicenter, multinational, randomized clinical
trial (TANGO I) conducted November 2014 to April 2016 and enrolling patients (�18 years)
with complicated UTI, stratified by infection type and geographic region.
INTERVENTIONS Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive meropenem-vaborbactam
(2g/2g over 3 hours; n = 274) or piperacillin-tazobactam (4g/0.5g over 30 minutes; n = 276)
every 8 hours. After 15 or more doses, patients could be switched to oral levofloxacin if they
met prespecified criteria for improvement, to complete 10 days of total treatment.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary end point for FDA criteria was overall success
(clinical cure or improvement and microbial eradication composite) at end of intravenous
treatment in the microbiologic modified intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Primary end point
for European Medicines Agency (EMA) criteria was microbial eradication at test-of-cure visit
in the microbiologic modified ITT and microbiologic evaluable populations. Prespecified
noninferiority margin was −15%. Because the protocol prespecified superiority testing in the
event of noninferiority, 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated.
RESULTS Among 550 patients randomized, 545 received study drug (mean age, 52.8 years; 361
[66.2%] women; 374 [68.6%] in the microbiologic modified ITT population; 347 [63.7%] in the
microbiologic evaluable population; 508 [93.2%] completed the trial). For the FDA primary
end point, overall success occurred in 189 of 192 (98.4%) with meropenem-vaborbactam vs
171 of 182 (94.0%) with piperacillin-tazobactam (difference, 4.5% [95% CI, 0.7% to 9.1%];
P < .001 for noninferiority). For the EMA primary end point, microbial eradication in the
microbiologic modified ITT population occurred in 128 of 192 (66.7%) with meropenem-
vaborbactam vs 105 of 182 (57.7%) with piperacillin-tazobactam (difference, 9.0% [95% CI,
−0.9% to 18.7%]; P < .001 for noninferiority); microbial eradication in the microbiologic evaluable
population occurred in 118 of 178 (66.3%) vs 102 of 169 (60.4%) (difference, 5.9% [95% CI,
−4.2% to 16.0%]; P < .001 for noninferiority). Adverse events were reported in 106 of 272
(39.0%) with meropenem-vaborbactam vs 97 of 273 (35.5%) with piperacillin-tazobactam.

pread of beta-lactamase enzymes among gram-
negative pathogens threatens the usefulness of many
beta-lactam antibiotics and has resulted in greater reli-
ance on carbapenems.1,2 Dissemination of carbapenemases
(eg, Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase) in Enterobacte-
riaceae worldwide is identified as an urgent threat by the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention, and the World Health
Organization has identified development of new agents as
a critical need.3-5 Infections due to carbapenem-resistant
Enterobacteriaceae are most often urinary tract infections
(UTIs), including acute pyelonephritis,6 and are usually health
care–associated.7,8 Mortality attributable to carbapenem-
resistant Enterobacteriaceae infections is 20% to 54.3%6,9-11
and reflects the need for better treatment options.
Vaborbactam is a cyclic boronic acid–based beta-
lactamaseinhibitorwithbroadinhibitoryactivityagainstserine
beta-lactamases, particularly K pneumoniae carbapenemase.
Vaborbactam plus meropenem was developed as a fixed
combination product for severe gram-negative infections,
including those due to carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteria-
ceae. Meropenem-vaborbactam has potent in vitro activity
againstKpneumoniaecarbapenemase-producingcarbapenem-
resistant Enterobacteriaceae and restores activity of me-
ropenem in animal models of infections due to these organ-
isms.12,13 Phase 1 studies demonstrated that meropenem and
vaborbactam have well-matched plasma and tissue pharmaco-
kinetic properties; exposures in preclinical models were well
tolerated.14,15 Given these properties, the Targeting Antibiotic
Non-SusceptibleGram-NegativeOrganisms(TANGOI)random-
ized clinical trial was conducted comparing meropenem-
vaborbactam with piperacillin-tazobactam in adults with com-
plicated UTI, including acute pyelonephritis.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
TANGO I was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-
blind, double-dummy, active-control trial enrolling adults
(≥18 years) with complicated UTI or acute pyelonephritis and
conducted from November 2014 to April 2016 in 60 sites in 17
countries: Belarus, Brazil, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Greece,
Hungary, Italy, Peru, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia,
South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, Ukraine, and the United States.
The study protocol and informed consent form were re-
viewed and approved by the institutional review board or in-
dependentethicscommitteeateachparticipatingsite.Thetrial
was conducted in accordance with ethical principles of Good
Clinical Practice, according to the International Conference on
Harmonisation Harmonized Tripartite Guideline. Prior to ini-
tiation of any study-related procedures, an informed consent
form was signed by the patient or by the patient’
s guardian or
legal representative.
Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are reported in
Supplement 1. Eligible patients were 18 years or older, 185 kg
or less, needed 5 or more days of intravenous antibiotics,
and had documented or suspected complicated UTI or acute
pyelonephritis (Supplement 1).
Complicated UTI was defined, based on US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) guidance,16 as having at least 2 of the fol-
lowing clinical criteria: (1) chills, rigors, or fever (temperature
≥38.0°C); (2) elevated white blood cell count (>10 000/mm3) or
left shift (>15% immature polymorphonuclear leukocytes);
(3)nauseaorvomiting;(4)dysuria,increasedurinaryfrequency,
or urinary urgency; or (5) lower abdominal pain or pelvic pain;
AND the presence of pyuria as evidenced by 1 of the follow-
ing: (1) white blood cell count 10 cells/μL or greater in unspun
urine;(2)10ormorecellsperhigh-powerfieldinurinesediment;
or(3)positiveleukocyteesteraseonurinalysis;ANDatleast1as-
sociated risk factor, including indwelling catheter, neurogenic
bladder,obstructiveuropathy,azotemiaduetorenaldisease,or
urinary retention in men due to benign prostatic hypertrophy.
Indwellingurinarycathetersordevices(includingnephrostomy
tubes, indwelling stents, or both) were removed or replaced
(iffeasible)within12hoursofrandomization.Signsorsymptoms
of acute pyelonephritis could also be defined by flank pain or
costovertebral angle tenderness on physical examination.
Race/ethnicity was included as part of required data
collected for a registered trial. Patients self-reported race/
ethnicity based on fixed categories as per regulatory guidance.
Patients were excluded if they required either an antibi-
otic in addition to study drug or antifungal therapy; received
an antibiotic within 48 hours before randomization (except for
singledoseofashort-actingoralorintravenousantibiotic);and
had estimated creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min. Pa-
tients who received more than 48 hours of an antibiotic could
be enrolled if they had clinical evidence of treatment failure
or developed complicated UTI or acute pyelonephritis.
Randomization, Stratification, and Blinding
Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 using a computer-
generated central randomization code, using a dynamic ran-
domization algorithm and interactive voice/web response sys-
tem to receive either meropenem-vaborbactam (2g/2g via
3-hour infusion) or piperacillin-tazobactam (4g/0.5g via 30-
minute infusion) every 8 hours, for 10 days of total treatment
(intravenous ± oral) (Figure 1). Patients also received drug-
free saline infusate (30-minute or 3-hour infusion) to main-
tain blinding. Blinded dose adjustment was made for pa-
tients receiving meropenem-vaborbactam and with estimated
creatinine clearance less than 50 mL/min (not needed for pa-
tients receiving piperacillin-tazobactam).

 site care team was instructed to remove or replace the remov-
able focus within 12 hours after enrollment. The specifics and
timing of the removal or replacement of the removable source
of infection were not captured in the study database.
After 15 or more doses of intravenous therapy, and if they
met prespecified criteria for improvement, patients could be
switched to oral levofloxacin (500 mg every 24 hours), to com-
plete 10 days of total treatment (intravenous + oral). Criteria
for switching to oral therapy are reported in Supplement 1.
Analysis Populations
The modified intent-to-treat (ITT) population was the popu-
lation to assess adverse events and comprised all patients who
received 1 or more doses of study drug. The microbiologic
modified ITT population included all patients in the modi-
fied ITT population with 1 or more bacterial pathogens of 105
colony-forming units (CFU)/mL or more in baseline urine cul-
tureorthesamebacterialpathogenpresentinconcurrentblood
and urine cultures. The microbiologic evaluable population in-
cludedallpatientswhometcriteriaforthemicrobiologicmodi-
fied ITT population and who had a clinical outcome and mi-
crobiologic outcome at end of intravenous treatment; received
80% or more and 120% or less of expected intravenous doses
for completed treatment duration; missed 1 intravenous dose,
or no doses, in the first 48 hours and missed 2 or fewer con-
secutive intravenous doses overall; received 6 or more doses
of study drug if classified as experiencing treatment failure on
overall outcome; or received 9 or more doses if classified as
experiencing cure on overall outcome.
Procedures
Studyproceduresincludedassessmentofstudyoutcomes,col-
lection of urine for urinalysis and cultures, collection of blood
for culture, and pharmacokinetic analyses. Assessments of ad-
verse events, clinical laboratory evaluations, vital signs, physi-
calexaminations,andelectrocardiogramswerealsoconducted.
Clinical Assessments
Clinical outcome assessment was performed on day 3 of study
treatment, at end of intravenous treatment, on the last day of
total therapy (end of treatment), at the test-of-cure visit (end
of treatment +7 days), and at the late follow-up visit (end of
treatment +14 days) (eFigure in Supplement 2). Visit assess-
mentswerecombinedatendofintravenoustreatmentandend
of treatment for patients who did not switch to oral therapy.
Investigators made clinical outcome assessments at each visit
based on improvement, no change, or worsening of the base-
line symptoms and signs.
Microbiologic Assessments
Urine and blood cultures were sent to a local laboratory for cul-
ture and susceptibility testing. Up to 2 isolated pathogens were
allowed per urine culture (at ≥105 CFU/mL urine). Urine cul-
tures with 3 or more bacterial organisms were considered con-
taminated.Ifanorganismgrewconcurrentlyinurineandblood,
itwasnotconsideredacontaminant.Allisolatesculturedatthe
local laboratory and designated as pathogens were sent to
thereferencelaboratory(JMILaboratories,NorthLiberty,Iowa)
for confirmation of identification and susceptibility testing re-
sults. Susceptibility testing was completed using Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute methods.17,18
Formicrobiologicoutcome,eradicationwasdefinedasbase-
line bacterial pathogens reduced to less than 104 CFU/mL on
urine culture (FDA criteria) or less than 103 CFU/mL (European
Medicines Agency [EMA] criteria) AND negative blood culture
for an organism identified as a uropathogen (if repeated after
positive finding at baseline blood culture).
Primary and Secondary End Points
The primary efficacy end point was assessed using different
criteria for the FDA and the EMA.16,19 For the FDA criteria, the
primary end point was overall success, a composite outcome
of clinical cure (complete resolution or significant improve-
ment of baseline signs and symptoms of complicated UTI or
acute pyelonephritis) and microbial eradication (baseline
pathogens reduced to <104 CFU/mL urine) at the end of intra-
venous treatment visit for the microbiologic modified ITT
population. For the EMA criteria, the primary end point was
microbial eradication (baseline pathogens reduced to
<103 CFU/mL urine) at the test-of-cure visit for the microbio-
logic modified ITT and microbiologic evaluable populations.
Secondary end points reported here include proportion
of patients with overall success at end of intravenous treat-
ment and at test-of-cure visits (by infection type) in the
microbiologic modified ITT population; clinical cure at end of
intravenous treatment and at test-of-cure visits in the micro-
biologic modified ITT population; microbial eradication to
less than 104 CFU/mL of urine for the FDA criteria and less
than 103 CFU/mL of urine for the EMA criteria at end of
intravenous treatment and at test-of-cure visits in the micro-
biologic modified ITT and microbiologic evaluable popula-
tions; per-pathogen outcomes (overall success, clinical
cure, and microbial eradication) in the microbiologic modi-
fied ITT population; and adverse event and tolerability
profile of meropenem-vaborbactam as assessed by vital
signs, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiograms, and
physical examinations.
Secondary end points not reported here include pharma-
cokinetic characterization of plasma exposure of meropenem
and vaborbactam; assessments in the clinical evaluable popu-
lation; and assessments on day 3 and the last follow-up visit.
Statistical Analysis
A sample size of approximately 500 patients with 60% in the
microbiologic modified ITT population, an overall success
rate at end of intravenous treatment of 80% in both treat-
ment groups, and a noninferiority margin of 15% provided
90% power to demonstrate noninferiority of meropenem-
vaborbactam to piperacillin-tazobactam in the microbiologic
modified ITT population. A sample size of 500 patients with
50% in the microbiologic evaluable population provided
84% power to demonstrate noninferiority of meropenem-
vaborbactam to piperacillin-tazobactam in the microbiologic
evaluable population.
For primary end point analyses, the proportion of pa-
tients with overall success and the proportion of patients with

 microbial eradication were summarized by treatment
group. Two-sided 95% CIs were presented for between-
group differences (meropenem-vaborbactam − piperacillin-
tazobactam), based on the method of Miettinen and
Nurminen.20 The prespecified noninferiority margin was a dif-
ference of 15%. Noninferiority was concluded if the lower limit
of the 2-sided 95% CI for the treatment difference for overall
successatendofintravenoustreatmentwasgreaterthan−15%.
For the EMA criteria, meropenem-vaborbactam was noninfe-
rioronlyifnoninferioritywasdemonstratedformicrobialeradi-
cation at test of cure in both the microbiologic modified ITT
and microbiologic evaluable populations. If noninferiority
was demonstrated in FDA or EMA primary end points, the pro-
tocol and statistical analysis plan included an assessment of
superiority using the CI to determine whether the lower bound
of the 2-sided 95% CI was greater than 0. A sensitivity analy-
sisoftheFDAprimaryendpointassessingonlythosewhowere
cured, as opposed to improved, was also conducted. The study
was not powered to demonstrate noninferiority for second-
ary end points.

provide therapy for patients who do not have other treatment
options to thus address this unmet need, it is recognized that
clinicians and regulators are willing to accept a lower level of
certainty about differences in efficacy between an estab-
lished comparator and a test agent that can provide activity
against drug-resistant pathogens.
As stated in the FDA Guidance Antibacterial Therapies
for Patients with an Unmet Medical Need for the Treatment of
Serious Bacterial Infections, “the guidance for industry Com-
plicated Urinary Tract Infections: Developing Drugs for Treat-
ment recommends a noninferiority margin of 10 percent for a
trial evaluating a new antibacterial drug based on reliable and
reproducible evidence of an antibacterial drug treatment ef-
fect of approximately 30 percent (the effect of the antibacte-
rial drug over placebo). An active-controlled trial showing non-
inferiority based on the selection of a noninferiority margin
greater than 10 percent but less than the treatment effect of
30 percent (eg, a noninferiority margin of 15 percent) still es-
tablishes effectiveness for the treatment of complicated UTI
but allows for a greater potential loss of efficacy. Such a find-
ing of noninferiority could be acceptable for patients who have
limited or no alternative treatment options for their serious in-
fectious disease.”21 Accordingly, a value of −15% for the lower
bound of the 95% CI of the difference between meropenem-
vaborbactam vs piperacillin-tazobactam was assumed in de-
signing and powering this study.
The Breslow-Day test was used to assess the homogeneity

observed, a mixed-effects logistic regression was conducted.
Results
Patient Disposition
A total of 550 patients at 60 sites in 17 countries were
randomized between November 2014 and April 2016: 274
to meropenem-vaborbactam and 276 to piperacillin-
tazobactam. The distribution of patients by sites is reported
in eTable 1 in Supplement 2. Of the 550 patients, 545 received
1 or more doses of study drug (modified ITT population): 272
received meropenem-vaborbactam and 273 piperacillin-
tazobactam (Figure 1). Of the 545 patients who received study
drug, 374 (68.6%) had bacterial pathogens of 105 CFU/mL or
greater in baseline urine culture or the same bacterial patho-
gen present in concurrent blood and urine cultures; these 374
comprised the microbiologic modified ITT population (192
meropenem-vaborbactam; 182 piperacillin-tazobactam).
Baseline characteristics for the 3 study populations (modi-
fied ITT, microbiologic modified ITT, microbiologic evalu-
able) are reported in Table 1 and in eTable 2 in Supplement 2.
The meropenem-vaborbactam and piperacillin-tazobactam
groups included numerically similar percentages of patients
with acute pyelonephritis (59.2% and 59.0%, respectively),
complicatedUTIwithremovablesourceofinfection(19.5%and
18.7%), and complicated UTI with nonremovable source of
infection (21.3% and 22.3%).
Patients presented with a mean of 3.5 symptoms (range,
2-6) at baseline in both the modified ITT and microbiologic
modifiedITTpopulations.Baselineurinarypathogenswerenu-
merically similar across the meropenem-vaborbactam and
piperacillin-tazobactam groups of the microbiologic modi-
fied ITT population, and Escherichia coli (65.1% and 64.3%, re-
spectively)andKpneumoniae(15.6%and15.4%)werethemost
commonly isolated urinary pathogens. Overall, nearly all base-
line urinary isolates were susceptible to meropenem and ap-
proximately 12% were resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam by
FDA criteria. Resistance to the most common pathogens using
FDA criteria is reported in Table 1 and using European Com-
mittee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing criteria22 is re-
ported in eTable 3 in Supplement 2.
Most patients in both groups of the modified ITT popula-
tion (91.5% meropenem-vaborbactam; 86.1% piperacillin-
tazobactam) completed study treatment (intravenous + oral).
Of those not completing treatment, most prematurely discon-
tinued intravenous therapy (8.1% meropenem-vaborbactam
group; 12.8% piperacillin-tazobactam). Treatment discontinu-
ations because of an adverse event (2.2% meropenem-
vaborbactam; 5.1% piperacillin-tazobactam) and physician
decision (2.9% meropenem-vaborbactam; 4.8% piperacillin-
tazobactam) were the primary reasons for the higher percent-
ages of intravenous treatment discontinuations in the pipera-
cillin-tazobactam group.
The majority of patients in both treatment groups (94.9%
meropenem-vaborbactam group; 91.6% piperacillin-
tazobactam) completed the study. Mean study duration was
approximately 25 days (maximum, 31 days). The primary rea-
sons for not completing the study in the meropenem-
vaborbactam and piperacillin-tazobactam groups were loss to

 follow-up (1.8% and 3.7%, respectively), patient withdrawal
(1.8% and 2.6%), and an adverse event (1.1% and 1.1%).
Duration of Treatment
Treatment duration was similar across both groups. Mean
duration of intravenous and oral step-down therapy in the
modified ITT population was approximately 10 days in the
meropenem-vaborbactam group (10.1 days [range, 1-17]) and
piperacillin-tazobactam group (9.9 days [range, 2-15]). Most
patients in both groups received 5 to 11 days of intravenous
therapy; the mean duration was 8.0 days in both groups (1-15
days for meropenem-vaborbactam; 2-15 days for piperacillin-
tazobactam).
Levofloxacin was used as oral step-down therapy in 146
patients (93.6%) receiving meropenem-vaborbactam and 137
(95.1%) receiving piperacillin-tazobactam. A percentage of pa-
tients in both groups were switched to oral step-down therapy
with levofloxacin despite having a levofloxacin-resistant
pathogen at baseline by FDA criteria (9.9% meropenem-
vaborbactam; 8.2% piperacillin-tazobactam) and European
Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing criteria
(9.9% in each group).
Efficacy Evaluation
Primary End Points
Noninferiority was met for the FDA primary end point of over-
all success in the microbiologic modified ITT population at end
of intravenous treatment and for the EMA primary end point
of microbiologic outcome of eradication at test of cure in the
microbiologicmodifiedITTandmicrobiologicevaluablepopu-
lations (Figure 2A).
At end of intravenous treatment, the overall success rate
in the microbiologic modified ITT population was 98.4%
with meropenem-vaborbactam vs 94.0% with piperacillin-
tazobactam (difference, 4.5% [95% CI, 0.7% to 9.1%];
P < .001 for noninferiority). The lower limit of the 95% CI
(0.7%) was greater than the prespecified noninferiority mar-
gin of −15%, demonstrating that meropenem-vaborbactam
was noninferior to piperacillin-tazobactam for the FDA pri-
mary end point (Figure 2A). Additionally, according to the
prespecified statistical plan, superiority of meropenem-
vaborbactam over piperacillin-tazobactam was concluded for
this end point since the lower limit of the 95% CI (0.7%)
exceeded 0 (P = .01).
Overall success for the primary end point at the end of in-
travenous treatment was clinical cure or improvement and mi-
crobial eradication. Results of a sensitivity analysis assessing
only patients who were cured, as opposed to improved, dem-
onstrated rates of overall success of 81.3% for meropenem-
vaborbactam vs 78.6% for piperacillin-tazobactam (differ-
ence, 2.7% [95% CI, −5.5% to 10.9%]).
In the microbiologic modified ITT population, at end
of intravenous treatment, overall success was 97.5%
for meropenem-vaborbactam and 94.1% for piperacillin-
tazobactam (difference, 3.4% [95% CI, −2.0% to 10.2%]) for pa-
tients with acute pyelonephritis; 100% and 92.1% (differ-
ence, 7.9% [95% CI, −2.5% to 20.9%]) for patients with

The differences and 95% CIs between treatment groups for
overall success at end of intravenous treatment for sub-
groups based on age, sex, renal function, diabetes status, sys-
temic inflammatory response syndrome status, Charlson
Comorbidity Index score, and geographic region are pre-
sented in Figure 3. In patients with bacteremia, follow-up
cultures were negative in all patients; the overall success for
complicated UTI, including acute pyelonephritis, at end of in-
travenous treatment was 83.3% (10/12) for meropenem-
vaborbactam and 100% (15/15) for piperacillin-tazobactam
(difference, −16.7% [95% CI, −45.4% to 6.3%]). The 2 patients
in the meropenem-vaborbactam group who did not achieve
overall treatment success for their UTI were deemed to have
experienced treatment failure because study drug was pre-
maturely discontinued owing to an adverse event.
For the Europe region, overall success at the end of intra-
venous treatment was 98.8% (171/173) for meropenem-
vaborbactam and 94.5% (154/163) for piperacillin-
tazobactam. The number of patients enrolled outside Europe
was relatively small, but overall success was similar: 94.7%
(18/19) for meropenem-vaborbactam and 89.5% (17/19) for
piperacillin-tazobactam. Of these 19 patients outside Europe
in each group, overall success for the patients in the US re-
gion was 100% (3/3) for meropenem-vaborbactam and 83.3%
(5/6) for piperacillin-tazobactam. There were no differences
in the primary end point by prespecified geographic region.
The P value to test for homogeneity of the odds ratio across
regions was .27 (Breslow-Day test), indicating no significant
region difference in the odds ratio.
In addition, as a post hoc analysis, a test for homogeneity
of the odds ratios among all centers was conducted using the
Breslow-Day test. The P value for this test was .37. Since no sig-
nificant center × treatment interaction was observed, a mixed-
effects logistic regression was conducted. In this model, the
primary end point (overall success at end of intravenous treat-
ment) was used as the dependent variable, with treatment as
fixed effect (meropenem-vaborbactam vs piperacillin-
tazobactam) and center as random effect. The odds ratio
obtained from the model was 4.23 (95% CI, 1.14 to 15.69). The
result demonstrates that the superiority of the overall suc-
cess rate in the meropenem-vaborbactam group over the

 piperacillin-tazobactam group was maintained when center
effect was accounted for in the model. These results were con-
sistent with the findings in the prespecified primary analysis
(including all centers) using risk difference as the test statistic.
For the EMA primary end point in the microbiologic modi-
fied ITT population, microbial eradication occurred in 66.7%
of patients (128/192) in the meropenem-vaborbactam group
vs 57.7% (105/182) in the piperacillin-tazobactam group at test
of cure (difference, 9.0% [95% CI, −0.9% to 18.7%]; P < .001
for noninferiority). For the EMA primary end point in the
microbiologic evaluable population, microbial eradication oc-
curred in 66.3% of patients (118/178) in the meropenem-
vaborbactam group vs 60.4% (102/169) in the piperacillin-
tazobactam group at test of cure (difference, 5.9% [95% CI,
−4.2%to16.0%];P < .001fornoninferiority)(Figure2A).Based
on these data, meropenem-vaborbactam was noninferior to
piperacillin-tazobactam because the lower limit of the 95% CI
for the differences between treatment groups in both popu-
lations was greater than the prespecified noninferiority
margin of −15%.
Key Secondary End Points
Overall Success | Overall success in the meropenem-
vaborbactam group was noninferior to that in the piperacillin-
tazobactam group at test of cure (74.5% and 70.3%, respec-
tively; difference, 4.1% [95% CI, −4.9% to 9.1%]) (Figure 2B).
At test of cure, overall success was 82.5% for meropenem-
vaborbactam and 75.2% for piperacillin-tazobactam (differ-
ence, 7.3% [95% CI, −3.5% to 18.3%]) in patients with acute
pyelonephritis, 60.0% and 60.5% (difference, −0.5% [95% CI,
−22.7% to 21.6%]) in patients with complicated UTI and a re-
movable source of infection, and 62.2% and 67.4% (differ-
ence, −5.3% [95% CI, −26.0% to 15.5%]) in patients with com-
plicated UTI and a nonremovable source of infection. Overall
success by infection type at end of intravenous treatment is
shown in Figure 2B.

 Evaluation of Adverse Events
In the meropenem-vaborbactam and piperacillin-tazobactam
groups, respectively, the proportions of patients who experi-
enced an adverse event (39.0% and 35.5%), study drug-related
adverseevent(15.1%and12.8%),severeadverseevent(2.6%and
4.8%),orlife-threateningadverseevent(congestivecardiacfail-
ure, septic shock secondary to salpingo-oophoritis, and an in-
fusion-related reaction) (1.1% and 0%) were similar; the num-
ber of patients who died (0.7% in each group), experienced a
seriousadverseevent(4.0%and4.4%)oranadverseeventlead-
ingtostudydrugdiscontinuation(2.6%and5.1%),orstudydis-
continuation (1.1% in each group) was low and similar across
treatment groups (eTable 4 in Supplement 2).
Adverse events occurring in 1.5% or more of patients in
either treatment group are reported in Table 3. Headache, all
instances of which were mild or moderate in severity, was the
most common adverse event reported with meropenem-
vaborbactam treatment, and no patients discontinued study
treatmentbecauseofheadache.Theproportionofpatientswith
a potentially clinically significant elevation in a laboratory test
value or vital sign was low and numerically similar in the treat-
ment groups.
Discussion
Noninferiority was demonstrated for meropenem-vabor-
bactamcomparedwithpiperacillin-tazobactamfortheFDApri-
maryendpointofoverallsuccessattheendofintravenoustreat-
mentinthemicrobiologicmodifiedITTpopulation.Inaddition,
superiority was observed. This finding is notable, given the ob-
served high efficacy of piperacillin-tazobactam (overall suc-
cess,94.0%).NoninferioritywasalsoobservedfortheEMApri-
mary end point of eradication at the test-of-cure visit in the
coprimarypopulations(microbiologicmodifiedITTandmicro-
biologic evaluable).
The overall success at the test-of-cure visit (74.5% in the
meropenem-vaborbactam group, 70.3% in the piperacillin-
tazobactam group) was lower for both treatment groups than
at the end of intravenous treatment (98.4% vs 94.0%, respec-
tively). These differences were driven primarily by lower rates
of microbial eradication at the test-of-cure visit (meropenem-
vaborbactam, 68.8%; piperacillin-tazobactam, 62.1%). The
lower outcomes at test of cure may have been affected by the
approximately 10% of patients who received levofloxacin as
oral therapy despite having a levofloxacin-resistant organ-
ism; however, these patients were distributed equally in the
2 groups. Clinical cure rates remained high at the test-of-cure
visit (90.6% in the meropenem-vaborbactam group vs 86.3%
in the piperacillin-tazobactam group), indicating that most of
the patients with microbiologic recurrence or persistence had
asymptomatic bacteriuria.
Piperacillin-tazobactam continues to be highly active
against Enterobacteriaceae isolated from patients with UTIs,
including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers, with
94.2%ofisolatesfrompatientsatUSmedicalcenterswithUTIs
ina2012to2014surveyshowntobesusceptible.23Piperacillin-
tazobactam is widely used to treat serious gram-negative in-
fections, including UTIs.24 Although approximately 12% of
Enterobacteriaceae were resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam
at baseline, there was no apparent relationship between
piperacillin-tazobactam minimum inhibitory concentrations
and overall success, clinical cure, or microbial eradication by
FDA or EMA criteria. This result may reflect that resistance is
defined according to plasma exposures and that high urinary
concentrations of piperacillin-tazobactam are achieved.
Meropenem-vaborbactam was well tolerated, with 2.6% of
patients discontinuing study treatment because of an adverse
event compared with 5.1% discontinuing piperacillin-
tazobactam. Overall incidence of adverse events and serious
adverse events was numerically similar between treatment
groups. The adverse event profile of meropenem-vaborbactam

 was comparable to that of piperacillin-tazobactam in this trial
and to that published for meropenem alone.25,26
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, the majority of pa-
tients were enrolled outside of the United States and, al-
though all were symptomatic, had pyuria, had urine cultures
with pathogen growth greater than 105 CFU/mL, and had sig-
nificant comorbidities, less than one-third met the criteria for
systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and it is unclear
whether all would have met criteria for hospitalization in the
United States.
Second, 31% of patients enrolled did not have a baseline
pathogen present at 105 CFU/mL or greater, despite meeting
theclinicalandpyuriacriteria,andthereforewerenotincluded
in the primary analysis population (ie, the microbiologic
modifiedITTpopulation).However,in2recentregistrationpro-
grams for complicated UTI including more than 1000 patients
eachforceftazidime-avibactam27andceftolozane-tazobactam,28
using the same inclusion criteria resulted in the exclusion of
20.6% and 25.1% of patients, respectively, from the microbio-
logic modified ITT population. In these trials,27,28 as in the cur-
rent one, the percentage of patients enrolled who meet the
symptom/sign inclusion criteria and have a baseline patho-
gens of 105 CFU/mL or greater ranges from 68% to 78%, sug-
gesting that the complicated UTI or acute pyelonephritis cri-
teriarequiredforenrollmentbasedonregulatoryguidancemay
not be reflective of clinical practice. The results of the nonin-
feriority and superiority analyses are restricted to the 68% of
patients who grew a pathogen at baseline.
Third,anextendedinfusionofpiperacillin-tazobactamwas
not used to match that of meropenem-vaborbactam; al-
though extended infusions of beta-lactam agents are being in-
creasingly used in practice, it is not standard for complicated
UTI, and the option was not acceptable to regulatory authori-
ties for this study.
Fourth, this study was not designed to evaluate the use
ofmeropenem-vaborbactamforthetreatmentofcarbapenem-
resistant pathogens, because enrolling such patients into
a trial with piperacillin-tazobactam as a comparator would
be unethical.
Conclusions
Among patients with complicated UTI and growth of a base-
line pathogen, meropenem-vaborbactam vs piperacillin-
tazobactam resulted in a composite outcome of complete reso-
lution or improvement of symptoms along with microbial
eradication that met the noninferiority criterion. Further re-
search is needed to understand the spectrum of patients in
whom meropenem-vaborbactam offers a clinical advantage.
