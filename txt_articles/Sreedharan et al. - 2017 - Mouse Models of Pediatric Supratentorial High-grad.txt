Abstract
High-grade glioma (HGG) is a group of primary malignant
brain tumors with dismal prognosis. Whereas adult HGG has been
studied extensively, childhood HGG,a relatively raredisease,isless
well-characterized. Here, we present two novel platelet-derived
growth factor (PDGF)-driven mouse models of pediatric supra-
tentorial HGG. Tumors developed from two different cells of
origin reminiscent of neural stem cells (NSC) or oligodendrocyte
precursor cells (OPC). Cross-species transcriptomics showed that
both models are closely related to human pediatric HGG as
compared with adult HGG. Furthermore, an NSC-like cell-of-
origin enhanced tumor incidence, malignancy, and the ability of
mouse glioma cells (GC) to be cultured under stem cell conditions
as compared with an OPC-like cell. Functional analyses of cultured
GC from these tumors showed that cells of NSC-like origin were
more tumorigenic, had a higher rate of self-renewal and prolifer-
ation, and were more sensitive to a panel of cancer drugs compared
with GC of a more differentiated origin. These two mouse models
relevant to human pediatric supratentorial HGG propose an
important role of the cell-of-origin for clinicopathologic features
of this disease. Cancer Res; 77(3); 802–12. �2016 AACR.
Introduction
Pediatric high-grade glioma (HGG) is a group of aggressive
primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors diagnosed in
children (age 0–19 years) that comprises astrocytomas of WHO
grade III (anaplastic astrocytoma) and IV (glioblastoma; ref. 1).
Astrocytomas are diffusely growing tumors of presumable glial
origin and are the most common primary malignant brain tumors
of adults. Pediatric HGGs are, however, relatively rare and repre-
sent around 8%–16% of all CNS tumors in children (2–4). A
majority of pediatric HGGs arise in the brainstem and are called
diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), but a large fraction of
these tumors are supratentorial and located in the cerebral hemi-
spheres. In this article, we refer to these tumors as pediatric HGGs.
Similar to adult HGGs there is no efficient treatment available.
Standard treatment of care for pediatric supratentorial HGG
includes maximal safe surgical resection followed by focal radi-
ation and chemotherapy, which extends survival but rarely is
curative. This makes pediatric HGGs among the most lethal
cancers in children with a 5-year survival of 20%–30% (2).
Pediatric HGGs are like adult HGGs highly heterogeneous.
Substantial progress has been made during the last decade in
understanding the biology and genetics of pediatric HGG. They
share genetic similarities with adult HGGs like alterations in
receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), activation of RTK signaling path-
ways, and loss of function of p53 and RB suppressor pathways
(5, 6), but perhaps more importantly there are distinct differences,
both in the frequency and type of mutations and copy number
alterations (CNA). Mutations in PDGFRA, H3F3A, ATRX, and
TP53 are significantly more common in pediatric tumors while
alterations in EGFR and PTEN are more common in adult HGGs
(6–8). Pediatric HGGs also have fewer and distinct CNAs (9)
where amplifications of PDGFRA are the most common genomic
event (5, 10).
Pediatric HGGs can be divided into molecular subgroups.
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of gene expression profiles
from 53 human pediatric HGGs produced three subgroups of
tumors (HC1–3) where the HC1 group was significantly enriched
for PDGFRA and/or PDGFB amplifications and the HC3 group
had a significant underrepresentation of gain of 1q (5). Further-
more, the pediatric HGG gene expression data was compared with
previously published adult glioblastoma expression profiles
(11, 12) that showed a clear separation but with a certain overlap
between adult and pediatric HGGs (5). Recently, a classification
based on DNA methylation that included both adult and pediatric
glioblastoma was presented (8). Six subgroups of glioblastoma
were identified (IDH1, K27, G34, RTK1 "PDGFRA," Mesenchy-
mal, RTKII "Classical"), of which only RTKII was devoid of
pediatric tumors. The majority of pediatric tumors were found

 in the K27, G34, and RTKI groups where the two first are defined
by different mutations in H3F3A. The epigenetic subgroups also
showed a difference in tumor location where K27 tumors were
mainly found in the midline (thalamus, brainstem, spinal cord)
while all other subgroups were located in the cerebral hemi-
spheres. The molecular characterization shows that pediatric
HGG is a highly heterogeneous disease and that PDGFRA is an
important driver of a subset of supratentorial pediatric HGGs.
The fact that HGGs can be found in many different locations of
the brain suggests that several different cell types in various parts
of the brain may develop HGG. If so, a reasonable hypothesis
would be that the cell-of-origin is contributing to the heteroge-
neous HGG phenotype. The identity of the cell-of-origin for HGG
remains unidentified but suggested by histopathology, marker
expression, and gene expression of HGG to be a neural or glial
stem cell. Mouse modeling has shown that many different CNS
cell types have the capacity to develop glioma (13–17). Most
mouse models of HGG have, however, only been related to adult
HGG (17–19), and there are few characterized mouse models of
pediatric supratentorial HGGs. Here we have investigated the
influence of two distinct and plausible glial cells of origin for
pediatric HGG development and HGG cell phenotype. We have
modeled supratentorial PDGFRA-driven HGG and have com-
pared the effect of developmental age and differentiation state
of the cell-of-origin for tumor development, analyzed the relation
of our models to human pediatric HGGs, and investigated the role
of the cell-of-origin for tumor development and the glioma cell
(GC) phenotype.
Materials and Methods
Additional descriptions of immunostainings, mouse GC
and neural stem cell (NSC) culturing, proliferation and differ-
entiation analyses, and drug response testing are available in
Supplementary information.
Infection of t-va transgenic mice and secondary tumor
induction in syngeneic mice
All animal experiments were performed according to Uppsala
University rules and after approval by the local animal ethics
committee. G/tv-a wt (20), G/tv-a;Arf�/� (21), C/tv-a wt (15), and
C/tv-a;Arf�/� (22) transgenic mouse lines were used. Mice were
infected at postnatal day (P) 0–2 (neonatal) or at 6–8 weeks of age
(adult) through injections of 105 DF-1 cells (in 2 mL PBS)
producing RCAS-eGFP or RCAS-PDGFB-HA. Coordinates in neo-
natal mice were 1.5 mm anterior of lambda, 0.7 mm lateral, and
1.5 mm ventral for intraventricular injection close to the subven-
tricular zone (SVZ; ref. 23). Coordinates in adult mice were 0.5
mm anterior of bregma, 1.1 mm lateral, and 2.5 mm ventral to hit
the SVZ. Mice injected with RCAS-eGFP were sacrificed 7 days
later. Mice injected with RCAS-PDGFB-HA were monitored and
killed upon symptoms of illness or at the endpoint of 15 weeks
postinjection. PDGFB-induced tumor incidence is summarized
in Table 1.
GCGFAP or GCCNP cells (105 in 2 mL PBS) were injected in P0-2
syngeneic mice as described above. Mice were monitored and
killed upon symptoms of illness or at the endpoint of 20 weeks.
Histopathology analysis of mouse brain tumors
Mouse brain tissue was fixed in 4% formalin for at least 48
hours and embedded in paraffin. Six-micron sections were cut
using a Microtome (HM 400 machine) and hematoxylin and
eosin stained for tumor grading. Histopathologic analyses
were performed in blind under the supervision of neuropatho-
logists (I. Alafuzoff and S. Libard) and were based on the 2007
WHO classification. Features evaluated were cell density, percent-
age of proliferative cells (Ki67), presence of apoptotic cells,
necrosis, mitotic cells, and endothelial cell proliferation in the
tumor region. Ki67 immunostainings were performed on at least
one section from each mouse tumor.
Mouse GC and CC cell cultures, and differentiation and
proliferation analyses
All cell cultures used were newly produced for this study in the
Uhrbom laboratory. Tumor and control tissues from SVZ of
uninjected G/tv-a;Arf�/� and C/tv-a;Arf�/� mice were explanted
and cultured under stem cell conditions (24). GCs were cultured
without addition of EGF and FGF2 and CCs (NSC) were cultured
in the presence of EGF and FGF2. All experiments using GCs were
performed on cells in passages 10–20. The cell cultures have not
been authenticated but all GC and CC cultures were tested
negative for mycoplasma at two different time points (at passages
4–15 and passages 14–23) using two different methods, MycoA-
lert (Lonza, catalog # LT07-418) and a PCR-based method using
primers
(Invitrogen)
Myco1
(50-GGCGAATGGGTGAGTAA-
CACG-30) and Myco2 (50-CGGATAACGCTTGCGACTATG-30)
using the KAPA kit (Techtum, catalog # 25-KK7352).
Differentiation was induced by adding 5% FBS (Sigma) to the
medium for 7 days. Bromodeoxyuridine BrdU (Sigma) was added
16 hours prior to fixation. Cells were stained for BrdU and neural/
glial markers. Pictures were taken using ZEN software in LSM700
confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss). Quantifications were done by
counting around 100 cells from each coverslip.
Limiting dilution assay
GCs and CCs were detached using Acutase (Invitrogen) and
seeded in 96-well ultra-low attachment plates (Corning) in 0.2
mL NSC medium. Seeding density ranged from 100 cells to 1 cell
per well and 10 replicates were used for each cell line. Cells were
left undisturbed for 7–10 days. The number of wells without
spheres for each cell density was plotted against the number of
cells in each well using GraphPad Prism 6.
Microarray analysis and preprocessing of the gene expression
dataset
Total mRNA was extracted from HGG tissue samples and GCs
along with control tissues (SVZ) and CCs using miRNeasy Mini
Kit (Qiagen). RNA was labeled and hybridized on Affymetrix
Mouse Gene ST 1.0 arrays at the SciLifeLab Array and Analysis
Facility. Data was processed using Robust Multichip Average
(RMA; ref. 25) for background correction, quantile normaliza-
tion, and expression values from multiple probes corresponding
to a single gene were merged. The average expression value was
used to represent the gene.

 Principal component analysis of gene expression data
The dataset was loaded into RStudio version 0.98.1103 (26)
running R v.3.2.2 (27), and the R function prcomp with default
values was used on the samples to perform the principal com-
ponent analysis (PCA). The R package plot3D was used for
visualization (28).
Comparison of our mouse array data to human pediatric and
adult HGG samples
To compare the mouse gene expression dataset with published
human HGG/GBM data, ortholog genes were matched using
HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee's (HGNC; ref. 29) Com-
parison of Orthology Predictions (HCOP; ref. 30) and gene names
were translated according to the HGNC. Gene expression data
from HGG tumor samples [Paugh and colleagues (5), Lee and
colleagues (12), and Beroukhim and colleagues (11)] were down-
loaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (31; Series GSE19578,
GSE13041) and from www.broad.mit.edu/cancer/pub/GISTIC.
Gene names were harmonized according to HGNC. The datasets
were compared together with our mouse dataset and an expres-
sion matrix of metagenes was generated using the metagene code
for cross-platform, cross-species characterization of transcription-
al profiles (32).
Analysis of drug response in mouse GCs
Mouse GCs (three GCGFAP and one GCCNP) and CCs (one CCG/tv-a
and one CCC/tv-a) were tested for their response to a 72-hour
treatment of 28 compounds (Table 2) using duplicate samples
and repeated twice. Cell viability was measured, dose–response
curves plotted, and the area under the curve (AUC) value calcu-
lated for each drug and cell sample. The fold change between
GCGFAP samples and GCCNP samples were calculated on the basis
of the average AUC value for each drug. The Welch t test with
Benjamini–Hochberg correction was used to measure the statis-
tical significance of the difference between the two groups. To see a
trend, the base-10 logarithm of the fold change was plotted along
with the corresponding negative base-10 logarithm of the adjust-
ed P value. The scatter plot was drawn in Mathworks Matlab
version R2015A (33).
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism 6
(GraphPad Software, Inc.). For comparisons of tumor incidence
and tumor grade between groups, Contingency tables and Fisher
exact test was used. All other group comparisons were done using
Student t test. Figures plotted from multiple experiments are
presented as mean � SD. Survival significance was evaluated
using log-rank tests where the values of P < 0.05 (�), P < 0.01
(��), P < 0.001 (���), and P < 0.0001 (����) indicate statistical
significance.
Results
Different cell types can be targeted by RCAS in the
subventricular zone of neonatal G/tv-a and C/tv-a mice
We have used the RCAS/tv-a mouse model to generate HGG,
where oncogene-carrying RCAS viruses are used to exclusively
infect tv-a–expressing cells (20). We used the G/tv-a and the C/tv-a
mouse lines in which the tv-a gene is under the control of the glial

 fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; ref. 20) or the 20, 30-cyclic
nucleotide 30-phosphodieasterase (CNP; ref. 15) promoters,
respectively. GFAP is expressed in NSCs (13) and astrocytes
(14, 34) and CNP is a highly specific marker for late oligo-
dendrocyte
precursor
cells
(OPC)
and
oligodendrocytes
(15, 16, 35). The mice were either wild-type (G/tv-a wt and
C/tv-a wt) or carrying a targeted deletion of the Cdkn2a locus
(G/tv-a;Arf�/� and C/tv-a;Arf�/�; refs. 21, 36, 37).
The NSC compartment, in this case only referring to the SVZ,
has been suggested to be involved in HGG development of
both children and adults (38). To direct RCAS infection to cells
of the NSC compartment, neonatal mice were injected with DF-
1 cells producing RCAS-eGFP in close proximity to the SVZ.
Injected mice were killed 7 days later and their brains were
analyzed with the purpose to characterize the infected cells. To
separate between infected GFP-expressing glial cells and the
injected GFP-expressing DF-1 chicken cells, we double-stained
for chicken vimentin and GFP (Supplementary Fig. S1). DF-1
cells were mostly found in clumps and were intensely bright
with small, round morphology, while infected mouse cells were
bigger and displayed varied morphologies and cytoplasmic
extensions. Only those larger, heterogeneous glial cells were
included in the subsequent quantification of GFP-infected cells.
Next, we performed double immunofluorescence stainings for
different glial markers (GFAP, CNP, nestin, SOX2, and OLIG2)
and GFP on several brain sections throughout the brains of
infected mice (Fig. 1). The absolute majority of infected cells
were found around the SVZ. For GFAP (Fig. 1A and B) and CNP
(Fig. 1C and D) we found, as expected, that the majority of
infected cells in G/tv-a mice were positive for GFAP and neg-
ative for CNP, and vice versa in C/tv-a mice. Analysis of the
neural stem and progenitor cell marker nestin (NES) showed,
similar to GFAP, that a high number of infected cells were
nestin positive in G/tv-a mice, while essentially no infected cells
were nestin positive in C/tv-a mice (Fig. 1E and F). For the glial
stem and progenitor cell marker SOX2, we found positive cells
in both mouse lines although significantly more in G/tv-a mice
(Fig. 1G and H). The opposite was found for the glial progen-
itor cell marker OLIG2 that was significantly more abundant in
C/tv-a mice (Fig. 1I and J).
Taken together, this analysis showed that different cell types
in the SVZ of neonatal G/tv-a and C/tv-a mice were targeted by
RCAS. In G/tv-a mice, infected cells showed an apparent imma-
ture, neural, or glial stem cell phenotype (GFAPþ/NESþ/
SOX2þ/CNP�/OLIG2þ), where the few OLIG2þ cells that
were present likely were a result of that differentiation along
the oligodendrocyte axis had occurred in the week after infec-
tion (39, 40). The marker expression of RCAS-infected cells
in the C/tv-a mouse brains (GFAP�/NES�/SOX2þ/CNPþ/
OLIG2þ) showed a clearly differentiated phenotype toward
the OPC lineage.
Developmental age and cell-of-origin affect glioma
development from GFAP- and CNP-expressing cells
in mouse SVZ
To analyze the role of cell-of-origin for glioma development in
the context of developmental age, we injected DF-1 cells producing
RCAS-PDGFB-HA in neonatal and adult G/tv-a wt, G/tv-a;Arf�/�,
C/tv-a wt, and C/tv-a;Arf�/� mice. Neonatal mice were injected in
the same location as above and adult mice were injected in the SVZ.
Upon symptoms of illness or at the experimental endpoint of
15 weeks, the animals were killed and brain tumors scored by
viewing at least five hematoxylin and eosin–stained sections from
each mouse brain (Table 1). All tumors were supratentorial and no
tumors were detected in the brainstem.
We found that developmental age had a significant impact
on tumor initiation where neonatal mice were more susceptible
to tumor development compared with their adult counterparts
in both G/tv-a wt (19/19 vs. 4/13, Fisher exact test, ����, P <
0.0001) and C/tv-a wt (8/22 vs. 0/10, Fisher exact test, �, P ¼
0.0353) mice. There was also a significant difference in survival
between tumors induced in neonatal and adult mice for both
G/tv-a wt and C/tv-a wt lines (Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B).
Furthermore, in G/tv-a wt mice, there was a significant differ-
ence in malignancy between tumors induced in neonatal and
adult mice (Supplementary Fig. S2C), where all tumors were
high-grade in neonatal mice and low-grade in adult mice. In
neonatal C/tv-a wt mice, the majority of tumors were low-grade
(grade II; Fig. 2D), and no tumors were found in adult C/tv-a wt
mice (Table 1).
Comparing tumor incidence between different cells of origin
in neonatal mice (Table 1), we found a significantly higher
incidence in G/tv-a mice compared with C/tv-a mice irrespec-
tive of p19Arf status (wt mice, 19/19 vs. 8/22, Fisher exact test,
��, P ¼ 0.0062; Arf�/� mice, 24/24 vs. 36/48, Fisher exact test,
����, P < 0.0001). Also, tumor development was accelerated
and malignancy increased in G/tv-a mice compared with C/tv-a
mice (Fig. 2A–D).
Taken together, our data show that neonatal glial cells were
more susceptible to tumor development than adult glial cells and
that glial stem cells were more prone to develop HGG than OPC-
like cells.
Gliomas induced in neonatal mice are related to subtypes of
human pediatric HGGs
The result from in vivo tumor development suggested that the
cell type and its age had an effect on inherent glioma cell
properties dictating tumor initiation and progression. To fur-
ther characterize the neonatally induced tumors, we sampled
HGG and control tissue for molecular analyses (Fig. 3A). We
also established GC cultures from neonatally induced tumors
using stem cell conditions to enrich for glioma stem cells (Fig.
3A). In parallel, we set up CC cultures of explants from the SVZ
of neonatal mice (Fig. 3A). Despite long experience of human
and mouse glioma cell culturing (24, 41), HGGs induced in
neonatal mice turned out to be a challenge. From G/tv-a;Arf�/�
mice, we finally produced 5 cultures out of 15 explanted tumors
and from Ctv-a;Arf�/� mice 1 culture out of 22 explanted
tumors. The significant difference in the ability of tumor cells
to be maintained in culture [5/15 vs. 1/22, Fisher exact test, P ¼
0.0306 (�)] strongly indicated that the originating cell type
could be important for the phenotype of GCs.
To investigate the relation and relevance of our neonatal
induced tumor models to human pediatric and adult HGG, we
performed transcriptome analysis of tissue samples (Fig. 3B) and
cell cultures (Fig. 3C). PCA of the mouse transcriptome data
showed a clear separation between the different tissue sample
groups with tumor and control samples well separated, as well as
tumor samples of different origin (Fig. 3B). Also, cell cultures
displayed a separation between tumor and control cells but
showed a less clear distinction between GCs of different origin
(Fig. 3C).

 To relate our neonatal mouse HGG models to human pediatric
HGG, we compared our mouse transcriptome data to published
human pediatric (5) and adult HGG (11, 12) gene expression data
using the metagene code for cross-platform and cross-species
comparisons. As mentioned above, the 53 pediatric HGG samples
had previously been classified into three subgroups, HC1–3,
where HC1 was associated with upregulation of cell-cycle–regu-
lating genes and amplifications in PDGFRA and/or PDGFB, HC2
linked to neuronal development, and HC3 related to extracellular
matrix receptors and cell adhesion. Hierarchical clustering of
mouse and human data using the most variably expressed genes
across the samples from the Paugh and colleagues dataset (5)
showed a partition, with a certain overlap, of adult and pediatric
human HGG samples and a relation of the mouse HGG samples
to the HC2 subgroup, while the GC samples were more related to
the HC1 subgroup (Fig. 3D). The separation of the mouse HGG

 samples and the mouse GC cultures likely reflects the lack of
tumor-associated cells and the enrichment of PDGFRA-driven
tumor cells in the GC samples.
In summary, these cross-species analyses provided evidence
that our neonatal-induced supratentorial mouse HGG models
were most related to subtypes of human pediatric HGG and
GBM.
Glioma cells from GFAP-expressing cells are more malignant
and have higher self-renewal and proliferation
As mouse modeling and GC culturing had showed a role of the
cell-of-origin for tumor development and tumor cell phenotype,
we investigated this further by performing functional analyses on
four GCGFAP cultures and one GCCNP culture. The cells were first
tested for their ability to generate orthotopic tumors in syngeneic
mice (Fig. 4A). All cell cultures could produce secondary tumors
and the difference observed in primary tumor development
between different cells of origin (Fig. 2B) remained significant
also in the secondary tumors (Fig. 4A). There was no significant
difference in tumor grade proportions between orthotopic tumors
induced by GCGFAP and GCCNP cells (data not shown).
Self-renewal was analyzed by limiting dilution assay (LDA). We
observed that the GCGFAP cultures required significantly fewer
cells (18 cells) to form at least 1 sphere per well compared with
the GCCNP cultures (28 cells; Fig. 4B). GCGFAP cultures also
formed significantly larger spheres compared with the GCCNP
culture (Fig. 4C), suggesting a difference also in proliferation.
Proliferation was analyzed by measuring BrdU incorporation and
GCGFAP cultures exhibited a significantly higher proliferative
ability compared with the GCCNP culture (Fig. 4D, �FBS). We
also investigated the response of the GC cultures to serum-
induced differentiation. Cells were cultured for 7 days in presence
of serum (þFBS) and BrdU incorporation was measured. A serum-
induced growth inhibition occurred in both GCGFAP and GCCNP
cultures (Fig. 4D, �FBS vs. þFBS) but the arrest was significantly
stronger in the GCCNP cells (Fig. 4D, þFBS). We also analyzed the
cell morphology and induction of glial cell markers upon serum-
induced differentiation and found that all serum-cultured cells
changed their morphology (Supplementary Fig. S3) and there was
a significant difference in marker expression between GCs of
different origin (Fig. 4E and Supplementary Fig. S3). Some of
the striking differences were that the presence of serum GCGFAP
cells significantly upregulated GFAP and TUJ1 and downregulated
OLIG2 (Fig. 4E, dotted lines), while GCCNP cells significantly
upregulated CNP and TUJ1, downregulated nestin and remained
OLIG2 positive (Fig. 4E, thin lines). This produced cells of

 distinctively different phenotypes when comparing CNP, OLIG2,
GFAP, nestin, and TUJ1 expression (Fig. 4E, thick lines), and
strongly supported that the HGGGFAP and HGGCNP tumors had
originated from different cell types.
As the G/tv-a;Arf�/� and C/tv-a;Arf�/� mouse lines have slightly
different and mixed genetic backgrounds we also performed
functional studies on the control NSC cultures (CCs) from neo-
natal G/tv-a;Arf�/� and C/tv-a;Arf�/� mice (Fig. 3A). We analyzed
self-renewal (Supplementary Fig. S4A), proliferation as mea-
sured by BrdU incorporation (Supplementary Fig. S4B) and
stem marker expression in the presence or absence of serum
(Supplementary Fig. S4C) and found no significant differences
when comparing CCG/tv-a and CCC/tv-a cells (Supplementary
Fig. S4D), suggesting that the differences in tumor development
and GC phenotype would not be due to genetic modifiers of the
different mouse lines.

 Glioma cells from CNP expressing cells are generally more
resistant to cancer drugs
The inherent phenotypic differences of GCs of different origin
encouraged us to investigate whether the cell-of-origin could also
affect the drug response of these cells. To investigate this, we used a
panel of 28 compounds (Table 2), of which most are in clinical
use for treatment of cancer or in clinical trials for cancer, targeting
a wide range of signaling pathways dysregulated in cancer cells.
We tested the response of these drugs on the viability of three
GCGFAP, one GCCNP, and two NSC control cell cultures (one
CCG/tv-a and one CCC/tv-a). The log10 fold change of the average
AUC value for CCG/tv-a and CCC/tv-a were calculated for each drug
(Supplementary Table S1) and the difference between each group
were compared using a Welch t test adjusted for multiple testing
(Fig. 5). We found that GCGFAP displayed a higher sensitivity than
GCCNP toward 14 compounds (Fig. 5 and Table 2), while no
compound showed the opposite effect. To analyze whether cell
proliferation, which was significantly higher for GCGFAP cells
compared to GCCNP cells (Fig. 4D), could be an important factor
influencing drug sensitivity, we compared the response of the GC
cultures to that of the control cells that displayed a higher
proliferation than any of the GC cultures (compare Supplemen-
tary Fig. S4B with Fig. 4D). We found no correlation between drug
sensitivity and proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S5); in fact, for
many of the compounds, the control cells were significantly more
resistant. Thus, GCs of more immature origin seemed to have a
higher general sensitivity to a wide range of cancer drugs.
Discussion
Pediatric supratentorial HGGs are relatively rare but highly
aggressive and lethal primary brain tumors for which there is a
lack of validated and relevant experimental models. Despite the
histopathologic similarities of these tumors to adult HGG, recent
large-scale integrated molecular data have showed distinct molec-
ular differences between adult and pediatric HGG. There are a
number of models for pediatric HGG available, in particular for
brainstem gliomas (42–44). These all have in common that they
originate from nestin-expressing cells using the N/tv-a mouse line
(34). Here we present the characterization of two new PDGF-
driven mouse models for pediatric supratentorial HGG, where
either GFAP- or CNP-expressing cells are targeted. We show that
there is a difference between neonatal- and adult-induced gliomas
with regard to incidence and tumor development, suggesting that
qualitative differences in the cell-of-origin due to age may dictate
important features of glioma biology. In line with what has been
found in human HGG, that pediatric HGGs carry fewer mutations
than adult HGGs (5–7, 45, 46), we here show that HGG devel-
opment in neonatal mice required fewer mutations than HGG
development induced in adult mice, both from NSC- and OPC-
like cells of origin.
Our data suggest that the as yet unknown cell-of-origin for
pediatric supratentorial HGG could be a neural or glial stemcell or
a glial precursor cell of the oligodendrocyte differentiation axis.
The cross-species transcriptome analysis showed that both cell
types produced tumors that were similar to the HC1 and HC2
subgroups of pediatric HGG and distinct from adult GBM.
Importantly, our results point that the cell-of-origin could be
affecting central characteristics of HGG such as disease progres-
sion and treatment response. Using the same oncogenic altera-
tions, tumors from a less differentiated GFAP-positive cell were
more aggressive, and tumor cells more tumorigenic, had higher
self-renewal and proliferation as compared with tumors induced
in a more differentiated, CNP-expressing OPC-like cell. However,
HGG lines derived from GFAP-positive cells were in general more
sensitive to a panel of selected cancer drugs, of which many are
used in the clinic (temozolomide, procarbazine, vincristine) or
are in clinical trials (melphalan, bortezomib, doxorubicin, etopo-
side, irinotecan, mebendazole, erlotinib, imatinib, lapatinib,
sorafenib) for treating HGG. This argues for an important role
of the cell-of-origin for the phenotype of HGG cells, which cannot
be captured by the current molecular analyses of HGG tissue
samples. Further investigations to validate this will require molec-
ular and functional analyses of human pediatric supratentorial
HGG cell cultures. Such cell models are rare and our attempts to
establish cell cultures from experimental, neonatal-induced
HGGs showed that it may be more difficult to maintain these
cells in long-term culture (47), where the cell-of-origin could be
one factor influencing this ability. In a recent study including 55
explanted pediatric brain tumor samples, a majority of samples
could be maintained in short-term culture but only six of those
reached beyond 6 months in culture (48).
It is clear that adult and pediatric HGGs are genetically, bio-
logically, and molecularly different. Here we show that our
neonatal-induced PDGF-driven HGG models in G/tv-a and
C/tv-a mice display many features similar to a subset of human
Figure 5.

group. The Volcano plot displays the result where the x-axis represents the log10
fold change of mean AUC values for GCGFAP and GCCNP, respectively, and the

pediatric HGGs. They will provide excellent models for further
basic and preclinical studies to uncover the underpinnings of this
devastating disease. Our finding that the cell-of-origin could
influence the response to treatment further underlines the impor-
tance of identifying clinically relevant subgroups and predictive
biomarkers of non-brainstem pediatric HGG.
