A defining feature of cortical layer 2/3 excitatory neurons is their sparse activity, often firing
in singlets of action potentials. Local inhibitory neurons are thought to play a major role in
regulating sparseness, but which cell types are recruited by single excitatory synaptic inputs
is unknown. Using multiple, targeted, in vivo whole-cell recordings, we show that single
uEPSPs have little effect on the firing rates of excitatory neurons and somatostatin-expressing
GABA-ergic inhibitory neurons but evoke precisely timed action potentials in parvalbumin-
expressing inhibitory neurons. Despite a uEPSP decay time of 7.8 ms, the evoked action
potentials were almost completely restricted to the uEPSP rising phase (~0.5 ms). Evoked
parvalbumin-expressing neuron action potentials go on to inhibit the local excitatory network,
thus providing a pathway for single spike evoked disynaptic inhibition which may enforce
sparse and precisely timed cortical signaling.

 T
he neocortex contains a recurrently connected network of
excitatory pyramidal (PYR) neurons that maintain brief,
sparse firing patterns during sensory processing and motor
behavior1. Powerful local inhibitory pathways are thought to pre-
vent runaway excitation and maintain sparseness2–7. For example,
somatostatin-expressing (SST) GABA-ergic inhibitory interneurons
can be recruited by single presynaptic PYR neurons and dis-
ynaptically inhibit neighboring neurons8–10. Recruitment of SST
neurons, however, requires trains of multiple unitary excitatory
postsynaptic potentials (uEPSPs) and which cell types are recruited
by single uEPSPs evoked by single PYR neurons is unclear.
This question is especially relevant for layer 2/3 (L2/3) of
primary somatosensory cortex (S1) that contains PYR neurons
with particularly sparse firing rates1,3,11,12. Prior studies have
investigated monosynaptic connectivity within L2/3 in some
detail and shown cell-type-specific differences in excitatory con-
nectivity rates, kinetics, and amplitude distributions. For example,
while PYR neurons provide input to only ~7% of neighboring
PYR neurons, they connect with far higher rates (>40%) to PV-
and SST-expressing GABA-ergic inhibitory interneurons8,13–15.
In all cell types, the majority of uEPSPs are <1 mV with only a
minority >2 mV13,16–23. However, the mean amplitude of a
uEPSP has been observed to be lower in PYR neurons (~0.5 mV)
than in fast spiking PV neurons21,24. Moreover, uEPSPs in SSTs
have especially high failure rates and are strongly facilitating in
comparison to the faster and more reliable inputs to PV neu-
rons8,9,13,25–27. Whether these synaptic features translate into
cell-type specific differences in the probability and timing of
action potentials (APs) generated by
uEPSPs has not been
addressed in vivo.
Here we performed multiple (2–4) in vivo two-photon targeted
whole-cell recordings in L2/3 of mouse S1 from a PYR neuron
and a nearby PYR, SST, or PV neuron. Multiple whole-cell
recordings gave us access to the membrane potential (Vm) of all
recorded neurons allowing us to evoke single presynaptic APs
and determine the electrophysiological features underlying the
transformation of a uEPSP into an AP. We show that during
depolarized phases of network activity, uEPSPs evoked by a single
presynaptic PYR neuron AP can drive temporally precise post-
synaptic firing in neighboring PV neurons, but not in PYR or SST
neurons. Evoked PV neuron APs were driven by larger amplitude
uEPSPs on the background of more depolarized network activity.
Evoked PV neuron APs in turn inhibit surrounding PYR neu-
rons. Thus, we provide a circuit for single spike evoked disynaptic
inhibition in vivo and show that, unexpectedly, the net effect of a
single L2/3 excitatory PYR neuron AP on the local network is
inhibition.
Results
Cortical L2/3 monosynaptic excitatory connectivity in vivo. To
examine the impact of single uEPSPs on postsynaptic spiking
in vivo, we used two-photon microscopy to target multiple whole-
cell recordings from excitatory, glutamatergic, PYR neurons, PV-
and SST-expressing GABA-ergic inhibitory interneurons in L2/3
of somatosensory barrel cortex in urethane-anesthetized and
awake P21-30 mice16 (Fig. 1a, b; Supplementary Fig. 1a; Sup-
plementary Table 1). Neighboring cells (mean somatic distance
42.46 ± 0.76 µm, range 15.06–160.62 µm, n = 831 tested connec-
tions) were targeted to the same focal plane at a mean depth
below the pia of −183.69 ± 1.05 µm (range −286.60 to −111.41
µm, n = 831 tested connections).
We first measured cellular membrane properties during
current injection and observed that input resistance (PYR =
88.88 ± 10.32 MΩ, n = 16; SST = 276.23 ± 48.76 MΩ, n = 7; PV
= 71.96 ± 7.07 MΩ,
n = 14;

and
membrane time constant (PYR = 10.55 ± 1.09 ms, n = 16; SST
= 27.54 ± 4.26 ms, n = 7; PV = 5.28 ± 0.54 ms, n = 14; Supple-
mentary Fig. 1c) were higher in SST neurons than in PV or PYR
neurons. AP half-width was significantly shorter in PV neurons
than in SST or PYR neurons (PYR = 2.14 ± 0.09 ms, n = 41; SST
= 1.61 ± 0.12 ms, n = 7; PV = 0.83 ± 0.09 ms, n = 22; Supplemen-
tary Fig. 1d), but AP threshold was similar across neuron types
(PYR = −31.79 ± 0.68 mV, n = 41; SST = −33.83 ± 1.07 mV, n =
7; PV = −31.25 ± 0.90 mV, n = 22; Supplementary Fig. 1e).
Under urethane anesthesia, all neurons showed slow (1–5 Hz)
fluctuations in the Vm from more hyperpolarized, synaptically
quiescent periods (DOWNstate) to depolarized, active periods
(UPstate). The amplitude of slow fluctuations, however, was
significantly smaller in SST neurons than in PYR or PV neurons
(Supplementary Fig. 1a, f). Notably PV neurons had higher mean
spontaneous
firing
rates
than
PYR
and
SST
neurons
(PYR = 0.07 ± 0.01 Hz, n = 207; SST = 0.23 ± 0.10 Hz, n = 12;
PV = 7.90 ± 1.30 Hz, n = 22, Supplementary Fig. 1g).
To test initially for monosynaptic connections from PYR
neuron to PYR, SST, and PV neurons, we evoked APs in PYR
neurons via a brief current injection and analyzed the Vm
responses in neighboring neurons in DOWNstates16 (Fig. 1c, see
Methods). While PYR neurons were only sparsely connected to
other PYR neurons (PYR to PYR 6.6% 51/774 neurons),
monosynaptic excitatory connectivity was similarly high to both
sets of inhibitory neurons (PYR to SST neuron 44.4%, 8/18
neurons; PYR to PV neuron 43.6%, 17/39 neurons, Fig. 1d).
There was no correlation between the probability of forming a
connection and the distance between the presynaptic PYR neuron
and SST or PV neuron somata (Supplementary Fig. 2a).

 Single excitatory synaptic inputs evoke APs in PVs. During slow
network activity in vivo, L2/3 PYR APs only occur during depo-
larized phases. Therefore, we went on to examine the impact of
single, experimentally evoked, PYR neuron APs on local connected
and unconnected neurons during UPstates. Single PYR neuron APs
did not trigger AP firing in unconnected PV, SST, or PYR neurons,
nor in monosynaptically connected PYR or SST neurons (Fig. 2a,
b). Strikingly, however, postsynaptic PV neurons could be recruited
to fire at short latencies following a single, evoked PYR neuron AP
(Fig. 2c). Single PYR neuron AP recruitment of PV neurons was
also observed under awake conditions (Supplementary Fig. 3). To
quantify this effect, we defined the “synaptic gain” as the number of
additional APs in the 5 ms bin following a single presynaptic PYR
neuron AP compared to the baseline rate 40–0 ms prior to the
evoked spike28,29 (see Methods). The average synaptic gain was
close to 0 for PYR and SST neurons, but 0.17 ± 0.04 (n = 14) for PV
neurons (Fig. 3a, b).
Can spontaneously occurring single PYR neuron APs also evoke
APs in PV neurons? We next performed spike-triggered averaging
of single spontaneous PYR neuron APs and examined the activity of
simultaneously recorded PYR, PV, and SST neurons. Intriguingly,
we observed that PV neurons that receive an excitatory synaptic
input from a neighboring PYR neuron, can follow spontaneous PYR
neuron APs with short latency and high fidelity (Supplementary
Fig. 4). Moreover, in a subset of the data, the average synaptic gain
was similar for evoked and spontaneous APs (synaptic gain: evoked
APs = 0.25305, spontaneous APs = 0.21467, n = 5, P = 0.625).
These data suggest that single spike recruitment of PV neurons
shapes local cortical activity during sparse spontaneous activity.
uEPSP features determining high synaptic gain in PV neurons.
Vm recordings allowed us to examine both the synaptic and
cellular properties determining the high synaptic gain in PV
neurons. Compared to excitatory inputs onto SST or PYR neu-
rons, uEPSPs in PV neurons showed faster temporal properties
with a shorter latency (PYR = 1.36 ± 0.13 ms, n = 28; SST = 1.10
± 0.16 ms, n = 6; PV = 0.55 ± 0.09 ms, n = 14; Supplementary
Fig. 2b), faster rise time (PYR = 1.84 ± 0.15 ms, n = 28; SST =
2.40 ± 0.38 ms, n = 6; PV = 1.11 ± 0.11 ms, n = 14; Supplemen-
tary Fig. 2c), earlier peak time (PYR = 5.63 ± 0.35 ms, n = 28;
SST = 7.74 ± 0.79 ms, n = 6; PV = 3.42 ± 0.40 ms, n = 14; Sup-
plementary Fig. 2d), and shorter half-width (PYR = 14.18 ± 1.84
ms, n = 23; SST = 20.43 ± 6.06 ms, n = 4; PV = 7.85 ± 1.60 ms, n
= 14; Supplementary Fig. 2e). Moreover, the mean amplitude of
uEPSPs was larger in PV than in SST or PYR neurons (PYR =
0.31 ± 0.07 mV, n = 35; SST = 0.55 ± 0.32 mV, n = 7; PV = 1.14

 ± 0.19 mV, n = 14; Fig. 4a, b). The kinetic properties of uEPSPs in
PV neurons were not well correlated to the synaptic gain (in all
cases P > 0.05, n = 14), however larger amplitude inputs are more
likely to trigger an AP (Fig. 4c).
To trigger an AP, the Vm change evoked by the uEPSP needs to
exceed AP threshold. AP threshold was similar across neuron
types (Supplementary Fig. 1e) but, during UPstates, the Vm was
more depolarized in PV than in SST or PYR neurons (PYR =
−50.68 ± 0.37 mV, n = 207; SST = −49.89 ± 2.74 mV, n = 7; PV
= −41.01 ± 1.28 mV, n = 12; Fig. 4d, Supplementary Table 1).
We therefore measured the absolute
uEPSP Vm peak value
(Fig. 4e) and show that the difference between the PV neuron AP
threshold and the uEPSP Vm peak value (AP Thr. - uEPSP Vm
Peak, see Methods) was also correlated with synaptic gain
(Fig. 4f). To test for possible interactions between (AP Thr. -
uEPSP Vm Peak) and (uEPSP amplitude) we performed a stepwise
multiple linear regression analysis which showed that, while both
variables influence synaptic gain (r = 0.914, P < 0.0001), they are
not correlated to each other (r = −0.438, P = 0.117). Therefore,
our data indicates that PV neurons are more likely than SST or
PYR neurons to fire an AP in response to a PYR neuron AP
during an UPstate because of a combination of their larger
amplitude uEPSPs being delivered on top of more depolarized
background
synaptic
input.
In
support,
similar
features
were observed in the synaptic dynamics around a spontaneous
AP: PV neurons have a depolarized baseline Vm followed by a
rapid depolarization in the 2 ms immediately prior to AP
threshold (Supplementary Fig. 5).
Single input PV neuron APs are evoked with millisecond
precision. The time at which APs are generated relative to the
uEPSP is an important determinant of the temporal coding capacity
of neural circuits. We therefore next compared the timing of the
evoked PV neuron APs with the uEPSP dynamics (Fig. 5a). Despite
a uEPSP half-width of ~8 ms, PV APs were reliably generated
during the rising phase of the uEPSP (mean AP jitter: 1.08 ± 0.09
ms, n = 9, Fig. 5b) at ~2 ms latency (2.23 ± 0.09 ms, n = 9, Fig. 5c).
Moreover, the half-width of the evoked PV PSTH was smaller than
the broad synaptic dynamics of the uEPSP, (half-width PSTH =
1.20 ± 0.15 ms, n = 7; half-width
uEPSP = 9.09 ± 1.31 ms, n = 7;
Fig. 5d) and the peak of the PSTH was ~1.3 ms before the peak of
the underlying uEPSP (Fig. 5e). APs are therefore precisely gener-
ated by uEPSPs suggesting that, in vivo, spike transmission from
PYR to PV neurons occurs at high fidelity29.
Cortical L2/3 monosynaptic inhibitory connectivity in vivo.
What impact do the evoked PV neuron APs have on the local
excitatory network? Paired recordings in quiescent cortical slices
have shown that PV neurons form dense GABA-ergic inhibitory
monosynaptic connections to PYR neurons that hyperpolarize
postsynaptic neurons away from spike threshold24,30–33. How-
ever, very little is known about monosynaptic inhibitory con-
nectivity in vivo. We therefore triggered single APs in SSTs and PVs
using current injection and measured the postsynaptic response in
PYR neurons during periods of DOWNstate and UPstate (Fig. 6a;
Supplementary Fig. 6a). As PYR neurons became further depolar-
ized from the GABA-ergic reversal potential, both PV and SST
neuron evoked uIPSPs strongly increased in amplitude (DOWN-
state: SST = −0.05 ± 0.02 mV, n = 7; PV = 0.03 ± 0.02 mV, n = 12;
UPstate: SST = −0.41 ± 0.13 mV, n = 7; PV = −0.33 ± 0.06 mV, n
= 20) (Fig. 6b, d, e; Supplementary Fig. 6b, d, e). Both SST and PV
neurons had a high likelihood of providing an inhibitory mono-
synaptic input to PYRs (connectivity rate: SST–PYR: 47.1%, 8/17;
PV–PYR: 60.6%, 20/33, Fig. 6c; Supplementary Fig. 6c). We did not
observe any significant differences in the kinetics of SST and PV
neuron-evoked uIPSPs in PYR neurons during UPstates (Supple-
mentary Fig. 7): latency (uIPSP latency SST = 1.84 ± 0.88 ms, n = 7;
PV = 1.43 ± 0.35 ms, n = 20), 20–80% rise time (uIPSP rise time
SST = 5.19 ± 0.86 ms, n = 7; PV = 5.51 ± 0.90 ms, n = 20), peak
time (uIPSP peak time SST = 13.13 ± 2.37 ms, n = 7; PV = 12.44 ±
1.26 ms, n = 20), 50% half-width (uIPSP half-width SST = 34.70 ±
10.24 ms, n = 5; PV = 20.68 ± 3.10 ms, n = 13). Together, our data
suggest that single inhibitory neuron APs during UPstates could
provide a dense and powerful source of inhibition to neighboring
PYR neurons.
Single PYR neuron APs evoke disynaptic inhibition. Disynaptic
inhibition of local PYR neurons can occur following trains of PYR
neuron APs by activating SST neurons through facilitating
synapses8,9. Because PV neurons can be recruited precisely by
single PYR APs, and given the high connectivity between PYR
and PV neurons, we hypothesized that disynaptic inhibition
might also be observed in neighboring connected and uncon-
nected PYR neurons following a single PYR neuron AP. We
therefore averaged Vm changes in local PYR neurons following
a single evoked PYR neuron AP. During periods of DOWNstate, we
observed unconnected PYR neurons, with no change in their Vm
(Fig. 7a, PYR4-5), and connected PYR neurons, with depolarizing
uEPSPs (Fig. 7a, PYR2-3). However, during periods of UPstate, when

 PV neurons can be recruited by single PYR neuron APs, we
observed hyperpolarization in a subset (32/113 ≤ −1*SD of the
amplitude distribution, green in Fig. 7b) of both connected and
unconnected PYR neurons in response to a PYR AP (Fig. 7a,
PYR3-4,b). Pooling these data revealed an overall hyperpolarization
(Fig. 7c, d) and a reduction in the spontaneous AP firing rate in the
30 ms following the PYR neuron AP (Fig. 7c, e). As SST and PYR
neurons were not recruited by single PYR neuron APs (Fig. 2), we
conclude that the single PYR neuron AP-evoked inhibition we
observe is mediated by PV neurons (Supplementary Fig. 8).
Therefore, single layer 2/3 PYR neuron APs have a measurable
effect on local network activity in vivo, however, due to the
powerful PYR to PV synaptic connection and high connectivity
rates from PV to PYR neurons, the net effect in neighboring PYR
neurons is inhibition.
Discussion
Multiple in vivo targeted whole-cell recordings allowed us to
evoke single presynaptic APs in genetically labeled neurons with
intracellular current injection and measure excitatory and inhi-
bitory sub- and supra-threshold membrane potential responses of
neighboring neurons during depolarized network activity. Using
this approach, we show that single uEPSPs from single PYR

 neurons can evoke precisely timed APs in vivo in PV neurons
that go on to inhibit the local network.
Monosynaptic transmission has been extensively studied
in vitro in cortical slices. Slice preparations may alter basic
properties of synaptic transmission due to neuronal cutting,
alterations in neuromodulator and ion concentrations and the
lack of network activity. However, as in prior cortical slice stu-
dies8,21,24,30–32,34, we observed that connectivity rates from PYR
neurons to PV (43.6%) and SST neurons (44.4%) are significantly
higher than those from PYR to PYR neurons (6.6%). Moreover,
the kinetics of uEPSPs were significantly faster in PV neurons
than in PYR or SST neurons, including a shorter onset latency,

time8,13,21,24,32. Finally, the amplitude of uEPSPs in PV neurons
was larger in amplitude than those in PYR21,24 and in SST neu-
rons. Thus, together with prior in vivo monosynaptic cortical
connectivity studies13,16, our data show that, while failure rates
are higher and synaptic depression weaker, a number of synaptic
properties are similar to prior in vitro work.
Faster
uEPSP kinetics and larger amplitude inputs in PV
neurons could be linked to their low input resistance and fast
time constant, differences in the time course of conductance
changes, higher degree of synchrony of synaptic release sites, as
well as the dominance of fast AMPA conductance over slower
NMDA35. The slower kinetics in SST neurons may result from
their high input resistance and slow membrane time constant.
Because of the high axial resistance of thin dendritic structures,
the location of synaptic contacts could also influence somatic
uEPSP amplitude. Interestingly, prior work has shown little cor-
relation between input location and uEPSP amplitude or rise time
in PV neurons36. Moreover, uEPSPs onto PV have comparatively
little variability in rise time13,36 (Supplementary Fig. 1). One
possibility is that the impact of input location in PV neurons is
low leading to a higher overall mean amplitude, perhaps resulting
from their electrotonic compactness and fast membrane time
constant. Subcellular dendritic stimulation or high-resolution
histology combined with paired recordings could help address
this question further.
Very little information is available about cortical monosynaptic
inhibitory transmission in vivo. In agreement with slice data37, the
amplitude of uIPSPs, strongly increased as PYR neurons depolarized
from DOWNstate to UPstate. This was most likely due to the
hyperpolarized reversal potential of uIPSPs and the change in
driving force associated with the depolarization during UPstate. The
rates of inhibitory connectivity we observed (PV 60.6%, SST 47.1%)
were comparable with in vitro studies8,21,24,30,31. Future con-
nectivity studies in vivo must now address excitatory and inhibitory
monosynaptic connectivity during different behavioral states in the
context of altered neuromodulatory input27.
Our data and prior in vivo Vm recordings have shown that PYR
neurons fire sparsely during depolarized phases of slow network
activity in awake and anesthetized mice1,11,38. We therefore went
on to examine the impact of uEPSPs on the generation of APs in
postsynaptic neurons during UPstates. The fast kinetics and lar-
ger amplitude suggested that excitatory inputs to PV neurons are
well suited for fast signaling29. We confirmed this in vivo by
showing that single excitatory inputs from PYR to PV neurons
can drive precisely timed APs during the rising phase of the
uEPSP with a mean synaptic gain of 0.17. Comparing the evoked
firing rates with postsynaptic membrane and cellular properties
showed that the higher level of recruitment of PV neurons
compared to SST and PYR neurons is likely the result of larger

 amplitude uEPSPs in PV neurons occurring on the background
activity of a more depolarized Vm during UPstates. Importantly,
spontaneous spike triggered averaging (Supplementary Fig. 4)
also showed a peak in the PSTH of fast spiking neurons fol-
lowing PYR neuron spiking. It will be important to go on to
examine how the transformation of
uEPSPs to APs in PV
neurons is affected by inputs from multiple presynaptic PYR
neurons, perhaps using patterned optogenetic stimulation of
multiple single cells.
Cortical synaptic inhibition and excitation are thought to be
strongly correlated, even at millisecond time scales5,39,40. Local
GABA-ergic inhibitory neurons are well placed to mediate the
fast tracking of excitation, with prior work revealing a prominent
disynaptic inhibitory circuit between PYR neurons mediated by
SST Martinotti cells8–10. However, although ACh release can
boost uEPSP amplitude to SST neurons during DOWNstates27,
SST neurons are typically activated by trains of presynaptic
APs due to their faciliating excitatory inputs, thus the source of
disynaptic inhibition during sparse firing of single neurons in L2/
3 was unclear. Our data shows that PV neurons can fire in
response to single uEPSPs during UPstates. Whether single uEPSP
mediated PV firing is present across cortical regions remains to be
determined. However, in vitro work using rat layer 5 visual and
somatosensory cortical slices has shown that experimental
depolarization of postsynaptic PVs can result in single uEPSPs
triggering APs29. Moreover, studies using human cortical slices
have
observed
single

of
PV
neurons41,42.
Notably, the PV neuron spiking response is observed during
the rising phase of the uEPSP. Rapid spiking responses during
rising phase of depolarizing synaptic inputs has been observed
during the spontaneous firing of sensory afferent inputs to motor
neurons43,44 and in slice experiments with excitatory inputs to
PV neurons29, potentially acting to and may act to prevent a
reduction in AP firing precision due to background activity45.
There has been debate about the impact and function of unitary
synaptic inputs from single cells on AP generation in cortical cir-
cuits. Some models of synaptic integration suggest that cortical
synapses act in a temporally precise, synchronous manner28,46–51,
while others that APs are generated as a noisy spike train roughly
computed from the average rate of hundreds of weak synaptic
inputs52,53. Our data show that single uEPSPs can evoke precisely
timed postsynaptic APs in a cell-type-specific manner.
In agreement with population PYR stimulation2, the stimulation
of single PYR neurons leads to a net inhibition of surrounding PYR
neurons (Fig. 7). Thus, our data support the proposal that single
PYR neurons can have a measurable effect at the network level53–60.
The inhibitory impact of PYR neuron APs likely acts to reduce local
firing rates and contribute to the sparse and desynchronized firing
of L2/3 PYR neurons. Moreover, the fast response time of the
evoked PV neuron APs provides a circuit for the tight coupling of
synaptic excitation and inhibition5,39,61 and may limit the time
available for summation of synaptic inputs to PYR neurons61,62.
Single spike evoked PV neuron firing may therefore provide a
mechanism to enhance synaptic coincidence detection46,48 and fast
temporal coding schemes28,45,50,63.
Given such high levels of local inhibition, it is perhaps not
surprising that PYR neurons require large depolarizing events to
trigger APs11,64. Future studies in behaving animals will help
establish the consequences of single spike evoked PV neuron
firing to cortical coding and help resolve the cellular and synaptic
mechanisms that allow PYR neurons to escape the dense inhi-
bition and fire APs.

 electrophysiological recordings were made under 1.5 g/kg urethane anesthesia. A
lightweight metal head support was implanted onto the skull and next, a small (1
mm2) craniotomy was drilled over the C2 whisker barrel column define by intrinsic
optical imaging response or stereotactic coordinates (−1.2 mm/3.5 mm lateral).
Finally, the dura was carefully removed prior to recording. For awake experiments,
mice were habituated to head restraint for 2–3 days and were given >2 h recovery time
from isoflurane anesthesia in their home cage before recording.
Two-photon targeted whole-cell patch clamp recordings. A Femto2D in vivo
two-photon laser-scanning microscope (Femtonics), illuminated with a Chameleon
Ultra II (Coherent) pulsed laser, was used to image cortical layer 2/3 neurons via a
×40 Olympus water immersion objective (LUMPLFLN 40XW, NA 0.8, W.D. 3.3
mm). We used 2 mm borosilicate glass, resistance 5–7 MΩ, (Hilgenberg) to make
whole-cell patch clamp recordings. Three to four pipettes were filled with intra-
cellular solution containing, in mM: 135 potassium gluconate, 4 KCl, 10 HEPES, 10
phosphocreatine, 4 MgATP, 0.3 Na3GTP (adjusted to pH 7.3 with KOH), 30 μm
Alexa-594 (Invitrogen) and 2 mg/ml biocytin. Current-clamp whole-cell recordings
were made using an Axon Multiclamp 700b amplifier (Molecular Devices) and an
Ag/AgCl ground electrode in the recording chamber. The membrane potential was
not compensated for the liquid junction potential.
To insert the pipettes through the pia and avoid blood vessels, a positive
pressure of 200–300 mbar was applied to the recording pipettes. As soon as the
pipette went through the pia the pressure was reduced to 60 mbar and the pipettes
moved to 100–150 μm from the pial surface and then reduced again to 30 mbar
until reaching the target neurons. Cell somata were then approached to within 20
μm. During two-photon imaging, because of the dye Alexa 594 contained in the
intracellular solution, neurons often look like dark cell bodies or “shadows” at
excitation wavelength 820 nm. For targeting specific interneurons or in some
experiments PYR neurons, we used the offspring of the mouse line Ai9, expressing
the loxP-flanked STOP cassette before the sequence of the fluorophore td-Tomato
(td-T), and PV-cre, SST-cre or NEX-cre mouse line. Recording pipettes were then
pushed up against the cell soma and contact was monitored with resistance changes
on an oscilloscope (Tektronix TDS2024C) and the live two-photon images. Next, a
gigaseal was formed between the patch electrode and the cell membrane with
negative pressure. To achieve whole-cell configuration we then ruptured each cell
membrane with negative pressure.
Recordings were digitized at 20 kHz, filtered at 10 kHz and recorded via an
ITC18 (Heka) analog to digital converter using IgorPro (Wavemetrics). The
recording depth and distance between cell soma was noted at the start of recording.
Next, −100 to +400 pA, 500 ms long current pulses were injected into each neuron
to measure the evoked firing patterns and obtain trains of APs. The current
threshold needed to trigger a single AP in each cell was then found manually using
the Multiclamp stimulus command. Next, short square current pulses of low
amplitude (10–20 ms, 100–400 pA) were injected into each cell at 1 or 0.5 Hz in
sweeps of 60 s to trigger single APs. In some experiments, current pulses of 20–50
ms were used to evoke multiple APs. In vivo Z-stack images (2 μm/slice) were
made after recording. All recorded neurons were confirmed online after the
recording according to the morphology of the filled cells (shape of the cell body,
dendritic apical truck and presence of spines) and their firing pattern. In vivo
images shown in figures show pseudo-colored green cells (intracellular dye alexa
594) and yellow cells that represent the spectral overlap of the pseudo-colored
intracellular dye with the genetically encoded fluorescent indicator td-T.
Histology. After recording, mice were deeply anesthetized by an additional i.p.
injection of urethane and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehdye
(PFA). The brain was removed, fixed in 4% PFA overnight and stored in PB at 4 °C
before histological processing for all brains. Next, 100 μm thick tangential slices
were made using a Leica VT1000 S vibrating microtome. We stained for cyto-
chrome oxidase to reveal the barrel cortex map and for biocytin, with a standard
ABC kit (Vectastain), with DAB enhancement, to reveal the recorded neurons.
Slices were mounted in Moviol, stored at 4 °C and reconstructed using NeuroLu-
cida software (MicroBrightField).
Datasets and analysis software. The rates of connectivity shown between PYR
neurons shown in Fig. 1d partly used the connectivity from a previous analysis
during DOWNstate16. All other analysis on PYR to PYR neuron connections was
during UPstates and was not previously reported. Data analysis was performed in
Matlab (Mathworks, MA, USA), Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, OR, USA), and StatEL (ad
Science, Paris, France) using custom written routines.
AP detection. To detect spontaneous or current evoked APs, we first split the data
into epochs with and without current injection. APs thresholds were detected
using the peak time of the third derivative of the Vm. AP peak times were then
detected by finding the maximum of the Vm following an AP threshold crossing
and this was used as the time point of the AP. Trials in which multiple APs were
evoked by current injection and trials with spontaneous APs that occurred just
before or after a current injection epoch were excluded.
Brain state classification. To classify brain state, each evoked AP was grouped
into those triggered during epochs of low synaptic cortical activity with a
hyperpolarized Vm (DOWNstate), or those triggered during epochs of synaptic
activity with depolarized Vm (UPstate). The Vm value of the DOWNstate/
UPstate was estimated for each AP in a 10 s window around the AP time by
averaging the bottom/top 10% of the Vm. To classify each AP into either
DOWNstate or UPstate, we estimated the amplitude of UPstate (UPstateAmp =
Vm difference between DOWNstate and UPstate) and the Vm fluctuation in
small window around the AP (−50 to 0 ms and 50 to 100 ms). APs were then
characterized into UPstate when the mean Vm around the AP was more depo-
larized than 20–30% of UPstateAmp and the Vm fluctuations >6 mV. We
excluded APs that were triggered at transitions between DOWNstate and
UPstate. Spontaneous PYR neuron APs were not classified into different states as
they only occurred during UPstate. For awake data, we analyzed postsynaptic
responses evoked during depolarized synaptic activity.
Input resistance and Tau. Current pulses (100 ms, −100 pA) were used to test for
input resistance in periods of DOWNstate. Access resistance was subtracted offline
using an exponential fit of the Vm from a 2 ms period after the start of current
injection. The difference in Vm between the baseline and the time point at which
the fit crossed the onset time of current injection was taken as the access resistance.
The input resistance was calculated from the difference in mV between the current
injection response corrected for access resistance and the prestimulus Vm. Tau was
calculated from the exponential fit of the relaxation phase of the Vm from 2 ms
after the end of the hyperpolarizing pulse.
AP half-width. To measure the AP half-width (Supplementary Fig. 1), we averaged
all spontaneous APs and measured the width at half height between AP threshold
and AP peak.
Spontaneous AP triggered averaging. To study the Vm depolarization and
dynamics prior to spontaneous APs (Supplementary Fig. 5), we aligned APs at
threshold (AP threshold = 0 ms). The Vm depolarization was measured 50 ms prior
to AP threshold and the Vm dynamics prior to spiking were measured as the
change in Vm from −2 to 0 ms prior to AP threshold.
Evoked postsynaptic responses. To study the impact of an uEPSP on a post-
synaptic neuron, we included pairs with a minimum number of single evoked AP
in the presynaptic PYR cell during epochs of active cortical activity, UPstate (PYR
n ≥ 20, STT n ≥ 50, PV ≥ 50). We then calculated the following measures of the
sub- and supra- threshold postsynaptic responses.
Synaptic gain. To estimate the efficiency of a uEPSP driving a postsynaptic AP
response (Fig. 3b), we counted the number of postsynaptic APs between 1 and 5 ms
following the presynaptic AP and subtracted this number from the average baseline
AP count (−40 to 0 ms). We termed this the synaptic gain after28. Due to the small
temporal integration window, a maximum of one evoked AP was observed per trial.
Because PYR neurons fire extremely few spontaneous spikes under urethane anes-
thesia, we were unable to measure the synaptic gain to spontaneous spikes in all pairs.
uEPSP Vm peak. To estimate the membrane potential of the PV neuron postsynaptic
response during epochs of network activity (Fig. 4e, f), we measured the uEPSP Vm
peak defined by the maximum Vm value in the 1–5 ms following the presynaptic AP
in the mean PV neuron response. PV neuron APs were truncated in this analysis.
AP latency and jitter. To estimate the temporal precision of the evoked AP in PV
neurons (Fig. 5b, c), we measured the latency and jitter of the first APs occurring in the
5 ms following the presynaptic AP. AP latency is given as the average latency between
the first APs following the presynaptic AP. AP jitter is given as the standard deviation
of the first AP latencies across trials. We included PV neurons with n > 10 evoked APs.
PSTH peak time and half-width. To estimate the peak time and half-width of the
evoked response (Fig. 5d, e), we calculated the PSTH of the AP times with 0.5 ms
resolution. This high-resolution PSTH was then fitted with a Gaussian function in
the interval between 0 and 6 ms following the presynaptic AP. In the population
analysis, we included only responses with good fits (Goodness of fit > 0.6) and clear
evoked AP rates (evoked AP rate > 15 Hz). From those cases, we extracted the
PSTH peak time (mean of the Gaussian fit) and the PSTH halfwidth (2.3548 *
sigma of the Gaussian fit).
Impact of single PYR neuron APs on neighboring PYR neurons. To study the
effect of a single PYR neuron AP onto the local PYR neurons (including connected
and unconnected PYR neurons), we analyzed 591 pairs of simultaneously recorded
PYR neurons. We analyzed single evoked PYR neuron APs in UPstate. Pairs with
>25 trials were included in the population average PSTH (Fig. 7: 113/591 pairs, in
total 9513 trials). For the population average of the subthreshold response, we
removed trials with spontaneous APs in the putative postsynaptic PYR neuron in a

 window −200 to 200 ms around the evoked AP (113/591 pairs, in total 7515 trials).
To estimate the amplitude of the Vm response, we measure the Vm difference
between the baseline (5–6 ms after the presynaptic AP time) and response (24–25
ms after the presynaptic AP time). The AP rate of the baseline was estimated in the
window −30:0 ms and the AP rate of the response in the window 0:30 ms following
the presynaptic AP.
Connectivity analysis. Connectivity analysis is described in detail in ref. 16. To
identify the presence of an excitatory monosynaptic connection for the rate analysis
(Fig. 1d), we measured the response to an evoked PYR neuron AP in DOWNstate.
To identify the presence of an inhibitory monosynaptic connection from PV and
SST to PYRs, we used the single evoked AP postsynaptic response in periods of
UPstate. Because of the strongly facilitating PYR to SST connection, we used single
APs as well as trains of 5 APs delivered in DOWNstate to identify the presence of a
connection from PYR to SST neurons. Kinetics analysis for uEPSPs and uIPSPs was
performed on single AP evoked PSPs during UPstate.
Kinetics of uEPSP and uIPSPs. The kinetics of single mean uEPSPs and uIPSPs
were measured and visually confirmed from the averaged response to a single AP
during network activity. Latency was measured as the crossing point of an extra-
polation of two linear fits: the first from −5 to −2 ms prior to the presynaptic AP;
the second between time points corresponding to 20–80% of the uEPSP/uIPSP
amplitude. Rise time was calculated as the difference in time between 20 and 80%
of the peak of the uEPSP/uIPSP on the rising phase. Amplitude was calculated as
the difference in Vm between the average Vm ± 0.5 ms around the peak response
and the average Vm ± 0.5 ms around latency. Half-width was calculated as the
difference in time between 50% of the rising phase and 50% of the decay phase of
the response. Decay time was calculated as the difference between the time points
on the decaying phase of the uEPSP/uIPSP corresponding to 20 and 80% of the
peak amplitude as measured on the rising phase.
Statistical analysis. A non-parametric, two-tailed, Wilcoxon Mann–Whitney
two-sample rank test was used for unpaired data and a non-parametric, two-
tailed, Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for paired data. The statistical
significance of a postsynaptic response was assessed using an unpaired Wil-
coxon Mann–Whitney two-sample rank. To test for correlations between fea-
tures of uEPSPs, we used Pearson’s correlation coefficient r with t statistics. To
check for interactions between synaptic gain, uEPSP amplitude and APThr –
uEPSP Vm peak we used stepwise multiple linear regression. Values are given as
mean ± s.e.m. unless otherwise stated. No statistical methods were used to
predetermine the sample size. No randomization or blinding was performed in
this study.
