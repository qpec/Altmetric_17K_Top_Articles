ABSTRACT
ObjeCtives
To examine the association between intelligence 
measured in childhood and leading causes of death in 
men and women over the life course.
Design
Prospective cohort study based on a whole population 
of participants born in Scotland in 1936 and linked to 
mortality data across 68 years of follow-up.
setting
Scotland.
PartiCiPants
33 536 men and 32 229 women who were participants 
in the Scottish Mental Survey of 1947 (SMS1947) and 
who could be linked to cause of death data up to 
December 2015.
Main OutCOMe Measures
Cause specific mortality, including from coronary heart 
disease, stroke, specific cancer types, respiratory 
disease, digestive disease, external causes, and 
dementia.
results
Childhood intelligence was inversely associated with 
all major causes of death. The age and sex adjusted 
hazard ratios (and 95% confidence intervals) per 1 SD 
(about 15 points) advantage in intelligence test score 
were strongest for respiratory disease (0.72, 0.70 to 
0.74), coronary heart disease (0.75, 0.73 to 0.77), and 
stroke (0.76, 0.73 to 0.79). Other notable associations 
(all P<0.001) were observed for deaths from injury 
(0.81, 0.75 to 0.86), smoking related cancers (0.82, 
0.80 to 0.84), digestive disease (0.82, 0.79 to 0.86), 
and dementia (0.84, 0.78 to 0.90). Weak associations 
were apparent for suicide (0.87, 0.74 to 1.02) and 
deaths from cancer not related to smoking (0.96, 0.93 
to 1.00), and their confidence intervals included unity. 
There was a suggestion that childhood intelligence 
was somewhat more strongly related to coronary heart 
disease, smoking related cancers, respiratory disease, 
and dementia in women than men (P value for 
interactions <0.001, 0.02, <0.001, and 0.02, 
respectively).
Childhood intelligence was related to selected cancer 
presentations, including lung (0.75, 0.72 to 0.77), 
stomach (0.77, 0.69 to 0.85), bladder (0.81, 0.71 to 
0.91), oesophageal (0.85, 0.78 to 0.94), liver (0.85, 
0.74 to 0.97), colorectal (0.89, 0.83 to 0.95), and 
haematopoietic (0.91, 0.83 to 0.98). Sensitivity 
analyses on a representative subsample of the cohort 
observed only small attenuation of the estimated 
effect of intelligence (by 10-26%) after adjustment for 
potential confounders, including three indicators of 
childhood socioeconomic status. In a replication 
sample from Scotland, in a similar birth year cohort 
and follow-up period, smoking and adult 
socioeconomic status partially attenuated (by 16-58%) 
the association of intelligence with outcome rates.
COnClusiOns
In a whole national population year of birth cohort 
followed over the life course from age 11 to age 79, 
higher scores on a well validated childhood 
intelligence test were associated with lower risk of 
mortality ascribed to coronary heart disease and 
stroke, cancers related to smoking (particularly lung 
and stomach), respiratory diseases, digestive 
diseases, injury, and dementia.
Introduction
Findings from prospective cohort studies based on pop-
ulations from Australia, Sweden, Denmark, the US, and 
the UK indicate that higher cognitive ability (intelli-
gence) measured with standard tests in childhood or 
early adulthood is related to a lower risk of total mortal-
ity by mid to late adulthood.1  The association is evident 
in men and women1 2 ; is incremental across the full 
range of ability scores2 
3 ; and does not seem to be con-
founded by socioeconomic status of origin or perinatal 
factors.1 
4 
5  Whereas similar gradients are also apparent 
for selected causes of death, such as cardiovascular dis-
ease,3 
6-10  suicide,7 
10-15  and injuries,7 
16 
17 the association 
with other leading causes remains inconclusive or little 
tested. Mortality surveillance for the entire population 
WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
Prospective cohort studies has shown that higher intelligence tested in childhood 
or early adulthood is related to greater longevity
This relation is replicated for deaths related to cardiovascular disease related and 
external causes, though evidence for the association with cancer related mortality 
is conflicting, and associations with other leading causes of death (such as 
respiratory and digestive diseases) are largely unknown.
Previous studies have mostly been in male conscripts followed up to middle 
adulthood
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
This study reported on the association between childhood intelligence in all men 
and women born in one year in one country and specific causes of death in older 
adulthood
Intelligence tested in childhood was inversely associated with leading lifetime 
causes of death, including coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer, external causes, 
respiratory disease, digestive related diseases, and dementia. The results for 
specific cancer sites were heterogeneous, and significant only for smoking related 
cancers
Lower intelligence in childhood was consistently associated with most leading 
causes of death in women, as well as in men as has previously been reported.

of one country born in 1936 who had an assessment of 
childhood intelligence provides the valuable opportu-
nity to examine little tested associations between intel-
ligence and mortality and consider specificity by 
exploring the strengths of these associations according 
to leading causes of death, in men and women, and 
over almost the entire life course.
Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain 
associations between intelligence and later risk of mor-
tality.18  The suggested causal mechanisms put forward, 
in which cognitive ability is the exposure and disease or 
death the outcome, include mediation by adverse or 
protective health behaviours in adulthood (such as 
smoking, physical activity), disease management and 
health literacy, and adult socioeconomic status (which 
could, for example, indicate occupational hazards).18 
Recent evidence of a genetic contribution to the associ-
ation between general cognitive ability and longevity,19 
 
however, might support a system integrity theory that 
posits a “latent trait of optimal bodily functioning” 
proximally indicated by both cognitive test perfor-
mance and disease biomarkers.20  None of these possi-
bilities are mutually exclusive. Whereas cognitive 
epidemiology18  makes a unique contribution to 
improved understanding of health inequalities in pop-
ulations, by its successful application of a well vali-
dated behavioural trait that performs independently of 
social gradients in its association with health indi-
ces,21 22  there remains a fundamental question regard-
ing how specific and multifaceted the link is between 
individual differences in intelligence and longevity. Evi-
dence for an association with several leading causes of 
death has either not been replicated (dementia and 
respiratory disease),7 23  is conflicting (different cancer 
sites),5 7 8 24-27  or is hitherto untested (digestive system 
disease). At least six publications have compared asso-
ciations between premorbid intelligence and a selec-
tion of cause specific mortalities,5 7 8 10 24 28  including 
some well characterised and extremely large cohorts 
with extensive follow-up; however, over-representation 
of men only samples7 
10  and follow-up that was termi-
nated in middle age5 
10  has limited the generalisability 
of findings. Furthermore, low numbers of events for dis-
eases common in older adult populations could have 
contributed to some apparently conflicting results.8

We investigated the magnitudes of the association 
between childhood intelligence and all major causes of 
death, using a whole year of birth population followed 
up to older age, therefore capturing sufficient numbers 
of cases for each outcome. Secondly, we investigated 
sex differences in the associations. Thirdly, we carried 
out sensitivity analyses to test for some possible mech-
anisms of association, including confounding and 
mediation by socioeconomic status.
Methods
study population and data sources
In this prospective cohort study, all individuals born in 
Scotland in 1936 and registered at school in Scotland in 
1947 were targeted for tracing and subsequent data link-
age to death certificates. This was carried out by the 
National Records of Scotland, with permission from the 
registrar general of Scotland, using the National Health 
Service (NHS) central register for members traceable in 
Scotland, and the MRIS Integrated Database and Admin-
istration System for those in England and Wales. The 
confidentiality advisory group of the health research 
authority gave support under section 251 of the NHS Act 
2006 for linkage without consent of mortality records 
including cause of death with intelligence scores age 11 
from the Scottish Mental Survey 1947 (SMS1947).25

Childhood intelligence
On 4 June 1947
, about 94% of the Scottish population 
born in 1936 who were registered as attending school in 
Scotland (75 252) completed a test of general intelli-
gence in the SMS1947 (n=70 805).25 29 31  This involved 
administration of the Moray House test No 12, which 
has 71 items tapping verbal and non-verbal reasoning 
ability.29  The test was introduced by school teachers 
who read aloud instructions before the start of a 45 min-
ute test period. Each participant was allocated a score 
out of the maximum of 76 (some items scored more than 
one point). A recent follow-up study showed that the 
test had good concurrent validity (correlation coeffi-
cient about 0.8) with a well standardised individually 
administered Stanford version of the Binet test of intel-
ligence in 194725 29  and with performance on Raven’s 
progressive matrices—a widely used non-verbal ability 
test (correlation coefficient about 0.7).32  The test has 
high lifelong stability of individual differences,33 
34  and 
several studies have provided good evidence for its 
external validity.28

Cause specific death outcomes
Causes of death were coded according to the ICD-6-10 
(international classification of diseases, 6th to 10th 
revisions) codes (see table A in appendix for codes). 
NHS (England and Wales) recorded deaths linked to 
cause of death data were provided for dates up to and 
including 31 December 2015, and respective data for 
NHSCR (Scottish) recorded deaths were provided up to 
30 June 2015. Subsequent cause of death updates pro-
vided by NHSCR, on a quarterly basis up to 31 December 
2015, were provided without unique ID numbers for 
individuals, and we therefore applied a matching pro-
cess to link these to SMS1947 data (appendix).
Patient involvement
No cohort participants contributed to the development 
of the present research question or the outcome mea-
sures, nor were they involved in the design, recruit-
ment, or conduct of the study. There is no intention to 
disseminate the results of this electronic data linkage 
study to its participants.
statistical analysis
The analytic sample includes 65 765 sample members 
who were traced for linkage to mortality records and 
who had a census date (that is, a last known GP regis-
tration date for those who emigrated or joined the 
armed forces) and an intelligence test score from 1947

(fig 1 ). They represent 92.3% of those who took part in 
the SMS1947 and 87
.4% of Scottish schoolchildren born 
in 1936. Exclusions because of missing intelligence test 
scores affected 6.8% (5103) of the total 1936 Scotland 
birth cohort, which has previously been reported,25 31 
and 6.6% (4744) of those who were successfully linked 
and had a census date.
We conducted analyses with SPSS Statistics 21, 
unless otherwise stated. Cox proportional hazards 
regression models produced hazard ratios with 95% 
confidence intervals to summarise the relation between 
childhood intelligence and each cause of death, 
adjusted for age (in days) at cognitive testing and sex 
(dummy variable), for which there were no missing 
data. We ran models in which the cause of death was 
cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, stroke, 
cancer by type, respiratory disease, digestive disease, 
externally caused, injury, suicide, or dementia. Given 
that suicide is the likely cause of death in most death 
certificates that state “open verdict” or “undetermined 
intent,”37  we reported not only on models to predict 
deaths formally recorded as suicide but added deaths of 
undetermined intent to models of suicide. A cause of 
death was included if it was listed among multiple 
causes of death (MCOD) on the death certificate, but we 
repeated each model in which the endpoint was the 
underlying cause of death38 (see appendix).
In survival analyses, the time scale was calendar time 
(days) from the date of the intelligence test (4 June 1947) 
to the census date, which was the earliest of date of 
death; last known date of GP registration (for migration 
or armed forces entrants); or 31 December 2015 (end of 
follow-up). Members who died from a different cause to 
that being modelled were included in the denominator 
(people at risk) and censored at date of death, as is stan-
dard practice in epidemiological analyses. The propor-
tional hazards assumption was assessed by inspection 
of log−log plots and formally tested in Stata 14 with the 
Schoenfeld residuals test. The assumption held for 
associations between intelligence and all major causes 
of death according to both methods, with the exception 
of deaths related to cancer with log−log plots and 
deaths from injury under formal testing (P=0.03). To 
visually inspect associations for linearity, we graphi-
cally plotted hazard ratios and their 95% confidence 
intervals to show the risk of each event type in accor-
dance with intelligence test score in 10ths (for >1000 
numbers of deaths) or quarters (for <1000 numbers of 
cases). For our main results, we estimated hazard ratios 
and their 95% confidence intervals for cause specific 
mortality according to a 1 SD (about 15 points) advan-
tage in intelligence test score. With the suggestion that 
some associations between intelligence and death are 
modified by sex, we formally tested for sex differences 
by including an interaction term (sex × intelligence 
score) in models predicting cause of death. We then 
 
produced effect estimates separately for men and 
women. Finally, to adjust for multiple testing, using R,39 
 
we made false discovery rate correction to significant P 
values resulting from all models40 and report on signif-
icant models (P<0.05) that failed this correction.
assessing selection bias caused by missing 
intelligence test data
We examined whether the 6.8% missing data on the 
intelligence test in the SMS1947 caused selection bias 
that affected the magnitude of the association between 
intelligence and mortality. We conducted sensitivity 
analyses using a representative subsample (1.7%; 
n=1208) of the SMS1947, the so called “6 day sam-
ple.”25 37 38 This subsample was affected by a similar 
degree of missing data as the whole SMS1947 on the 
Moray House test; however, they all took an additional, 
individually administered intelligence test on another 
occasion (see appendix for more details).
Confounder adjustment: adjustment for school
In the absence of individual level data on socioeco-
nomic status in the full SMS1947, we used school 
attended as a proxy measure to adjust for potential con-
founding by background socioeconomic status. A Scot-
tish cohort study has shown that primary school has 
moderate correlation with paternal social class.41 
Schools were specified as strata in the models for major 
causes of death and cancer subtypes, and fixed effects 
models adjusted for all characteristics shared by pupils 
from the same school were. As children could be 
selected into some schools because of previous cogni-
tive ability, however, there might be over-adjustment in 
this particular sensitivity analysis.
Confounder adjustment: subgroup analyses
We repeated models for leading causes of death in asso-
ciation with childhood intelligence scores in a represen-
tative subsample of the SMS1947
, the so called “30 day 
sample” (7
.2%; n=5083), on whom more background 
data were available to test for potential confounding 
(see appendix for more information). These data 
included socioeconomic status variables (paternal 
occupational status, home overcrowding, and school

and physical disability).
adjustment for adult socioeconomic status and 
smoking: replication sample
In the absence of data in the intermediary “lifetime” 
period of the study with which to test for potential 
mediation, we report on equivalent models run on a 
replication sample—the “West of Scotland Twenty-07 
study”—with and without adjustment for adult smok-
ing status and occupational status. This cohort shares 
similarities to the SMS1947
, including Scotland derived 
1930s birth cohort and linkage to mortality records to at 
least 2015 (see appendix).
Results
Characteristics of the sample
Among 75 252 members of the 1936 birth cohort, 3242 
were untraceable, 630 had no census dates (that is, 
migrated without a last known GP registration date), 
4744 had no data on childhood intelligence, and 871 
were mismatches of the linkage (fig 1). Among 65 765 
individuals (32 229 were women; 5182 attended different 
schools) comprising the analytic sample, 25 979 had 
died and 30 464 were confirmed to be living in the UK at 
follow-up. Mean age at death was 66.1 (SD 10.6); mean 
time to follow-up was 57
.0 (SD 18.4) years, and total per-
son years of follow-up was 3.54 million. There were no 
marked differences in the characteristics of the analytic 
sample and the remainder of the SMS1947
, except that, 
among those with a childhood mental test score, the 
analytic sample scored on average higher on the Moray 
House test (mean 37
.1, SD 15.7) than those excluded from 
the analyses (35.4, SD 16.4; P<0.001).
Childhood intelligence in relation to cause specific 
mortality
Figure 2 shows the associations between childhood 
intelligence (by 10ths or quarters) and risk of the major 
causes of death. These show that, for most endpoints, 
associations were inverse—that is, higher childhood 
intelligence was associated with a lower risk of cause 
specific death. Risk of death related to lifetime respira-
tory disease was two thirds lower in the top performing 
10th for childhood intelligence versus the bottom 10th. 
Furthermore for deaths from coronary heart disease, 
stroke, smoking related cancers, digestive diseases, and 
external causes, risk of mortality was halved for those 
in the highest versus lowest 10th of intelligence. The 
risk of dementia related mortality and deaths by suicide 
were reduced by at least a third in the highest perform-
ing quarter of intelligence test score versus the lowest 
quarter. There was no evident association between 
childhood intelligence and mortality from cancers not 
related to smoking.
Figure 3 shows the risk of major causes of death asso-
ciated with a 1 SD higher score in childhood intelligence 
(see fig A in appendix for the equivalent plot where the 
outcome was underlying cause of death rather than 
MCOD). All hazard ratios showed inverse associations, 
and most showed narrow confidence intervals. The 
strongest effect sizes were seen for respiratory disease 
(hazard ratio 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.70 to 0.74), 
coronary heart disease (0.75, 0.73 to 0.77), and stroke 
(0.76, 0.73 to 0.79). All others fell within the hazard ratio 
range 0.80-0.87, except for deaths from cancers not 
related to smoking cancer (0.96, 0.93 to 1.00)—the sig-
nificance of this latter effect did not survive correction 
for false discovery rate. The relatively wide confidence 
interval for deaths from intentional self harm reflects 
the lower number of cases for this endpoint (0.87
, 0.74 to 
1.02). When deaths of undetermined intent were 
included in the model for suicide, the confidence inter-
val fell below 1 (0.84, 0.74 to 0.96; 220 cases).
Sex interaction effects were computed with childhood 
intelligence in the total sample, and sex specific hazard 
ratios were also estimated for the associations between 
childhood intelligence and leading causes of death (table 
B in appendix). In models of the total sample, interaction 
terms for sex × intelligence were significant for risk of 
cardiovascular disease (P<0.001), coronary heart disease 
(P<0.001), smoking related cancers (P=0.02), respiratory 
diseases (P<0.001), and dementia (P=0.02). Though the 
inverse patterns of the association between intelligence 
and mortality observed for the total sample were seen in 
both men and women, the magnitude of the associations 
were slightly greater among women than among men for 
most cause specific deaths. The greatest difference in 
effect estimate was for dementia, whereby a 1 SD higher 
score in childhood intelligence was associated with a 
10% reduced risk of death from dementia in men and a 
24% reduced risk in women. Otherwise, between men 
and women there were equivalent hazard ratios for 
deaths from cancer not related to smoking and external 
causes of death, except for deaths by intentional self 
harm, which were associated with childhood intelligence 
in men (hazard ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.66 
to 0.96) but not women (1.15, 0.82 to 1.60). This sex differ-
ence was also evident for suicide when we included open 
verdict deaths (0.76, 0.66 to 0.89, in men; 1.05, 0.83 to 
1.34, in women; P=0.03 for sex × intelligence interaction 
effect in the total sample).
Childhood intelligence in association with death by 
specific cancer type
Figure 4 shows the associations between groupings of 
childhood intelligence score (10ths or quarters) and 
deaths related to 15 specific cancers. About half of these 
showed inverse patterns of association with a degree of 
linearity, including cancers of the oesophagus, colon or 
rectum, stomach, liver, lung, kidney, bladder, and 
blood. The strongest association was evident for death 
related to lung cancer: the risk in the highest perform-
ing 10th of childhood intelligence was reduced by two 
thirds compared with the lowest performing 10th. Can-
cers showing negligible or irregular associations with 
childhood mental ability included mouth, pancreas, 
skin, ovaries, breast (women only), prostate (men only), 
and brain or central nervous system.
Figure 5  shows the strengths of association between 
a 1 SD higher score in childhood intelligence and risk of 
death related to 15 specific cancers, with total cancers

as a comparator (see fig B in appendix for equivalent 
forest plot reflecting underlying cause of death cases 
only). Whereas the effect estimate for death by any can-
cer clearly shows an inverse association with narrow 
confidence intervals (hazard ratio 0.86, 95% confidence 
interval 0.84 to 0.88), there is obvious heterogeneity 
across the results for specific cancer sites. Among the 
eight specific cancers that showed linearity in their 
inverse association with childhood mental ability in 
 
figure 4, the plot shows robust associations for seven of 
these (oesophageal, colorectal, stomach, liver, lung, 
bladder, and lymphoid or haematopoietic), with hazard 
ratios in the range 0.75-0.91. The strongest associations 
with childhood mental ability were deaths associated 
with lung cancer (0.75, 0.72 to 0.77) and stomach cancer 
(0.77
, 0.69 to 0.85).

We included an interaction term that included sex 
and childhood intelligence in models for IQ and specific 
cancer related mortality in the total sample and calcu-
lated sex specific hazard ratios (table C in appendix). 
These analyses showed no clear sex differences in direc-
tion or magnitude of the association between childhood 
intelligence and cancer specific mortality. The signifi-
cant sex interaction effect (P=0.013) with mental ability 
in predicting lung cancer in the total sample could be a 
chance finding, and the direction of association was the 
same in men (hazard ratio 0.77
, 95% confidence interval 
0.74 to 0.81) and women (0.70, 0.66 to 0.75).
sensitivity analyses: assessment of selection bias 
caused by missing intelligence test data
In analyses of the so called “6 day sample” of the 
SMS1947 (that is, those born on the first day of the even 
numbered months of 1936), selection bias according to 
missing Moray House test scores in the SMS1947 did not 
affect the effect size of the association between intelli-
gence test scores (on the Terman-Merrill, an individu-
ally administered test) and total mortality (see 
appendix).
sensitivity analyses: assessment of potential 
confounding
Firstly, we attempted to control for potential confound-
ing by adjusting for the fixed effects of school attended 
in the full SMS1947
. The hazard ratios for cause specific 
mortality and for deaths related to cancer subtype 
mostly showed a reduction by a small amount (attenu-
ation range 0-30%) (see figs C and D in appendix), and 
the patterns of specificity were similar to those in the 
main analyses.
Secondly, in subgroup analysis of the SMS1947, 
including 2039 men and 1992 women in the 30 day sam-
ple, hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals 
showed inverse associations between childhood intelli-
gence and all cause mortality and mortality related to 
cardiovascular disease, cancer (smoking related), respi-
ratory disease, and digestive disease (but not cancers 
not related to smoking, external causes, and dementia, 
unlike in the total sample) (see table D in appendix). 
Respiratory disease held the strongest association with 
childhood intelligence (hazard ratio 0.73, 95% confi-
dence interval 0.66 to 0.80), as in the full sample. In 
confounder adjusted models that included three indica-
tors of childhood socioeconomic status, the relation 
between intelligence and all cause mortality or mortal-
ity from cardiovascular disease, any cancer, smoking 
related cancer, respiratory disease, or digestive disease 
was attenuated by 7-26%. Addition of physical status to 
the model had modest impact (attenuation range 
10-26%).
sensitivity analyses: assessment of mediation
In a replication sample—the West of Scotland twenty-07 
study—we observed similar hazard ratios to the 
SMS1947 for the associations between intelligence 
(tested in middle age) and specific underlying causes of 
death (fig C in appendix), though they were slightly 
stronger and with less precision. The one noticeable dif-
ference was for stroke as the underlying cause of death, 
which showed a weak association with midlife intelli-
gence (hazard ratio 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.70 
to 1.15). After we adjusted for smoking, adult socioeco-
nomic status, and self rated health, there were attenua-
tion effects of 27-65% (table E in appendix), and 
associations remained the most robust for respiratory 
disease (0.77
, 0.59 to 0.99) and coronary artery disease 
(0.79, 0.65 to 0.96).
discussion
In this first whole population birth cohort study linking 
childhood intelligence test scores to cause of death, in a 
follow-up spanning age 11-79, we found inverse associa-
tions for all major causes of death, including coronary 
heart disease, stroke, cancer, respiratory disease, diges-
tive disease, external causes of death, and dementia. 
For specific cancer types the results were heteroge-
neous, with only smoking related cancers showing an 
association with childhood ability. In general, the effect 
sizes were similar for women and men (albeit margin-
ally greater for women), with the exception of death by 
suicide, which had an inverse association with child-
hood ability in men but not women. In a representative 
subsample with additional background data, there was 
evidence that childhood socioeconomic status and 
physical status indicators had no more than a modest 
confounding impact on the observed associations. A 
replication study with adult data on smoking and socio-
economic status showed less than a quarter to two 
thirds percentage attenuation of the equivalent effect 
estimates for intelligence test performance in associa-
tion with cause specific mortality.
strengths and weaknesses of this study
One weakness of the study is the absence of covariate 
data from childhood that could account for the effect 
estimates we observed in our main analysis. This lack of 
data, however, should be balanced with evidence from 
our sensitivity analyses, including a representative

subsample of the cohort. Additionally, there are exten-
sive reports from nearly all published studies that have 
attempted to control for potential confounding. In our 
own analysis of the whole SMS1947, adjustment for 
school led to little attenuation of the associations 
between intelligence and mortality. Because this is only 
a proxy for background socioeconomic status, and 
because it could lead to over-adjustment as some 
schools select on cognitive ability, however, we under-
took further sensitivity analyses. In our own analysis of 
a representative subsample of the SMS1947
, three indi-
cators of background socioeconomic status, which are 
significant correlates of intelligence test scores, 
explained a quarter or less of the associations between 
intelligence and cause specific mortality. This is consis-
tent with the main literature that has reported low 
attenuation effects in models of premorbid intelligence 
and all cause (such as in the meta-analysis by Calvin 
and colleagues1 ) or cause specific mortality, including 
cardiovascular disease,4 
5 
10 
42-44  cancer,5 
26  and external 
causes,5 10 45  including suicide10 15 46  and death from 
injury.10 16 17  Additional adjustments for perinatal fac-
tors and/or physical status indicators also show mar-
ginal (if any) attenuation effects,4 
5  as we observed here 
in our adjustment of height and physical disability. 
Other psychological factors that have been shown to 
correlate with intelligence test performance, including 
personality traits and mental health indicators, could 
yet partially explain these associations. In a previous 
paper on the 6 day sample of the SMS1947
, however, we 
found that the personality trait of “dependability” 
(rated in adolescence and similar to the widely studied 
trait called conscientiousness), which was also predic-
tive of mortality, did not account for the association 
with intelligence.47  In a different sample, the personal-
ity trait of neuroticism was shown to moderate, but not 
attenuate, the association between intelligence and 
death.48 The strength of some of the associations we 
reported, however, such as with respiratory disease, are 
perhaps too strong to be explained by any potential 
confounders we are aware of from the literature.
Another factor affecting validity of findings is histor-
ical inaccuracy of death certificates. Particular causes 
of death that could be under-reported by coroners 
include dementia,49  stroke,50  and suicide.37 Therefore, 
we judge that the greater chance of false negatives rela-
tive to false positives in the present study would act, if 
at all, to slightly attenuate the observed effect sizes. 
Indeed, a further analysis, in which we included “open 
verdict” deaths in the suicide model, increased the haz-
ard ratio and narrowed its confidence interval.
Strengths of the present study include its analysis of 
a near complete year of birth cohort from a nation’s 
population, with a high return of linkage to all histori-
cal death records. The follow-up period from childhood 
through to older age enabled us to consider all major 
causes of death in the UK across the life course. Not 
only can we reproduce more accurately, and with low 
bias, results from previous cohorts on cardiovascular 
disease and external causes of death, but we have been 
able to make a substantial contribution to the literature 
on premorbid intelligence and risk of cancer and report 
for the first time on associations between childhood 
intelligence and death from diseases of the digestive 
system. Furthermore, our whole population sample of 
men and women enables the reporting of sex specific 
effects, which are often lacking from the literature, 
which draws heavily on data from male conscripts. For 
example, we have been able to report for the first time 
on the association between premorbid intelligence and 
the full range of subtypes of cancer in women. And we 
report for the first time on somewhat greater effect sizes 
among women relative to men for several causes of 
death, including respiratory disease and smoking 
related cancers.
Comparison with other studies
An important aspect of the present study was to con-
sider the role of premorbid intelligence in relation to 
specific cancer sites, given the considerable heteroge-
neity in cancer aetiology and conflicting findings from 
previous studies of an association between premorbid 
intelligence and risk of total cancer mortality.5

8 
24-27  A 
cohort study of more than a million Swedish male con-
scripts—the largest to date—reported that, among 20 
incident cancers, only three had significant associa-
tions with premorbid intelligence.27  The authors con-
cluded that, with the likelihood of a few statistical false 
positives, cancer was unlikely to explain the associa-
tion between premorbid intelligence and total mortality 
risk. Based on evidence from the present study, and 
other comparatively smaller cohorts, however, we 
would caution against over-generalising this summary. 
Our results are consistent with previously reported 
effect sizes for premorbid intelligence in association 
with lung cancer5 7 8 24  and stomach cancer.8 24 27  Fur-
thermore, we have shown, perhaps for the first time,

that an association between previous intelligence and 
risk of cancer might be specific to types of smoking 
related cancer. We found significant inverse associa-
tions for five other smoking related cancers: oesopha-
geal, colorectal, liver, bladder, and haematopoietic. 
Whereas two previous studies reported null findings for 
risk of colorectal and pancreatic cancer in association 
with childhood intelligence, there were low case num-
bers.8 
24  Indeed in a recent study of 728 165 Danish men, 
intelligence in early adulthood was significantly 
inversely associated with total gastrointestinal can-
cers.7  A pertinent question remains why more types of 
smoking related cancer were not related to premorbid 
intelligence in the study of a million Swedish men.27 
This could be because of their much younger age at 
death ascertainment and/or national differences in 
prevalence of cigarette smoking. Sweden has been 
exemplary in its reduction in cigarette use (particularly 
among men) since the late 1960s,51  and maximum prev-
alence rates of smoking in Sweden at the time when the 
Swedish conscript study was conducted would have 
been much lower52  than equivalent rates in Scotland 
during our follow-up.53  If smoking is less prevalent in 
the Swedish population, and if smoking is an important 
mediator of the association between premorbid intelli-
gence and risk of cancer, then this might explain the 
reduced and non-significant effect sizes reported by 
Batty and colleagues.27  One notable and significant 
finding from Sweden was a positive association 
between intelligence at conscription and incident skin 
cancer, indicating that higher ability was associated 
with an increased risk.27  Although the pattern of this 
relation in our own data corroborates this result, we did 
not observe a significant effect, perhaps because our 
older cohort grew up in a time before cheap flights to 
hot countries became ubiquitous and the proliferation 
in risk of skin cancer. The literature on premorbid intel-
ligence and other cancer types is relatively small and/or 
underpowered. We report for the first time on the asso-
ciation with ovarian cancer in women, which we found 
to be null, and we replicate findings of previous studies 
of null associations with breast cancer in women5 8 24 
and prostate cancer in men.27
Preliminary evidence of an inverse association 
between childhood intelligence and risk of dementia 
related death was reported from case-control studies of 
the 1932 Scottish Mental Survey that were linked to inci-
dent dementia records.54 
55  A recent prospective cohort 
study of this sample, followed up to 92 years, validated 
the finding.23  Our findings are consistent with this, as is 
evidence of a greater association with risk of dementia 
related mortality among women than men, also 
observed in the older Scottish cohort.23  This sex differ-
ential is also supported by evidence from individual 
participant meta-analyses showing that early school 
leaving in childhood is associated with death from 
dementia in women and not men.56
Mortality related to respiratory disease had the stron-
gest association with premorbid intelligence in the 
present study (hazard ratio 0.72, 95% confidence inter-
val 0.70 to 0.74). In a recent study of male conscripts in 
Denmark, which was the only previous study to report 
on the association, mortality from respiratory disease 
also had one of the strongest associations with premor-
bid intelligence (0.62, 0.60 to 0.65)7 —only homicide was 
stronger in its association. Previous evidence that pre-
morbid intelligence is associated with self reported 
chronic lung disease by midlife57 
58  and measured lung 
function in later life59-62  supports these results. In con-
trast, a Scottish study reporting a weak and non-signif-
icant inverse association with incident respiratory 
disease might have been underpowered.8
Our own effect sizes for risk of mortality in associa-
tion with premorbid intelligence corroborate those 
reported in the literature for all cause mortality (hazard 
ratio 0.80 versus aggregate hazard ratio of 0.80 in stud-
ies of ≥40 years’ duration),1  total cardiovascular dis-
ease (0.76 versus hazard ratios of 0.74-0.93),7-10 63  and 
coronary heart disease (0.75 versus hazard ratios of 
0.70-0.86).3 
4

64  The effect sizes for risk of stroke in 
association with premorbid intelligence have been less 
consistent in the literature, with significant inverse 
associations for incident or fatal only stroke observed in 
cohorts from Denmark, Scotland, Sweden, and the 
US3 4 7 65  and negligible associations reported in sepa-
rate cohorts from Denmark and Scotland.8 9 42  Weaker 
associations with stroke in previous studies are proba-
bly influenced by low numbers of stroke cases in cohort 
studies, driven in part by historical under-reporting of 
stroke in death certificates50  and/or relatively low num-
bers of ischaemic versus haemorrhagic strokes,7 partic-
ularly in cohort studies with follow-up in younger age 
groups. In our study cohort followed to older age, the 
observed effect size for risk of fatal stroke was equiva-
lent in magnitude to that for coronary heart disease.
Our findings accord with previous reports of inverse 
associations between premorbid intelligence and risk of 
externally caused deaths, specifically from Danish and 
Scottish cohorts.5 
7 
45  In the Scottish study that followed 
up on deaths from ages 15 to 57
, external causes of death 
held the strongest association with childhood intelli-
gence relative to cancer, cardiovascular disease, and 
total mortality.5  In contrast, we found that external 
causes of death held the weaker association when com-
pared with mortality from cardiovascular disease. It 
could be that differences in the composition of specific 
types of death that are externally caused in a younger 
versus older age cohort could influence the magnitude 
of this effect. Moreover, the hazard ratio we report for 
death from injury in association with childhood intelli-
gence (0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.75 to 0.86) is sim-
ilar in magnitude to that is a study of Danish men born 
in 1953, intelligence tested at age 12, and followed up to 
age 48 (0.82, 0.78 to 0.86).16  On the other hand, in stud-
ies where intelligence was tested in late childhood or 
early adulthood, the effect size in relation to death from 
injury has been greater (0.71 and 0.76, respectively).7

Several high powered prospective studies of cohorts of 
male conscripts have reported inverse associations

cide, including studies from Australia,11  Denmark,7 12

association in women and with follow-up to older ages. 
Our findings, however, are similar to the only previous 
study we are aware of to report on sex differentials for 
incident suicide risk in association with premorbid 
intelligence in a 40 year follow-up study, where an asso-
ciation was evident in men (age adjusted odds ratio of 
0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.83 to 0.99) but negligi-
ble in women (1.04, 0.90 to 1.20).66
explanations and implications for future research
The strongest associations we observed were for natural 
causes of death related to coronary heart disease, 
stroke, respiratory disease, lung cancer, and stomach 
cancer. Smoking is a modifiable risk factor in each of 
these diseases, and higher premorbid intelligence has 
been related to lower likelihood of current smoking67  or 
past regular smoking68  and the increased likelihood of 
quitting smoking.68 
69  Indeed, in a recent comparison of 
effect sizes for intelligence and cause specific mortali-
ties in Danish men, the authors made a similar sum-
mary of their own findings by implicating smoking as 
an important mediator in the context of natural causes 
of death.7  Nevertheless, when tested, smoking is no 
more than a partial mediator in associations between 
premorbid intelligence and total mortality,3  mortality 
related to coronary heart disease,63  and incident coro-
nary heart disease or stroke.64  In our replication study, 
the addition of adult smoking showed small attenuat-
ing effects (12-27%) on the associations between midlife 
performance on intelligence tests and most cause spe-
cific mortalities, including coronary artery disease and 
respiratory disease, and had moderate attenuation 
effects on the associations with smoking related can-
cers and lung cancer (40% and 50%, respectively). Edu-
cational attainment or indicators of occupational status 
in adulthood have generally shown stronger attenuat-
ing effects.1  Though education is likely to fall on the 
causal pathway, after intelligence and before death, 
given evidence that differences in intelligence predict 
later outcomes of national school examinations,70  edu-
cation might alternatively be a proxy indicator of intel-
ligence and yet have no direct causal association with 
longer life. This is an ongoing discussion about possible 
over-adjustment by education in cognitive epidemiol-
ogy.71  It is likely that the influence of a health behaviour 
(or pattern of behaviours) in explaining associations 
between premorbid function and cause specific mortal-
ity will be more precisely measured by future studies 
with repeat assessment across the life course, capturing 
cumulative risk. Indeed, follow-up of the Whitehall II 
study showed that four repeat measures of lifestyle 
behaviours accounted for far more of the socioeconom-
ic-mortality gradient than baseline measurement 
alone,72  albeit this difference was evident for specific 
behaviours (especially physical activity) and not all 
(such as smoking). Alcohol consumption might have 
accounted for some of the association we observed 
between premorbid intelligence and digestive related 
mortality, and this could be similarly assessed. Alcohol 
related deaths were associated with premorbid intelli-
gence in a 37 year follow up of the 1969-70 Swedish 
 
conscripts cohort.73 Childhood performance on intelli-
gence tests was most strongly associated with deaths 
from respiratory disease. This might be attributable to a 
combination of prevalence of smoking and occupa-
tional related exposures. For many in this birth cohort, 
those in the working classes spent their early careers in 
mining and shipbuilding industries (men) or as clean-
ers and factory workers (women). Therefore, it is possi-
ble that, with the decline in rates of smoking and toxic 
exposures in the workplace, the magnitude of associa-
tions between IQ and death could be lower in more 
recent birth cohorts. Nevertheless, when we adjusted 
for background social class in our subgroup analyses, 
and for smoking and adult occupational status in our 
replication study, the risk of deaths from respiratory 
disease in relation to intelligence scores was only par-
tially attenuated (by 12% and 33%, respectively).
Whereas the research literature has taken advantage 
of often rich lifestyle data to explore mediating effects 
on a pathway from premorbid intelligence to risk of 
mortality, recent evidence from longitudinal data from 
twins suggests the association might be largely caused 
by common genetic effects.19  With newly emerging data 
from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), there is 
likely to be a sizeable shift towards the testing of poten-
tial genetic factors, alongside environmental factors, in 
cognitive epidemiology. Recent GWAS data used in the 
context of the large UK Biobank sample has provided 
evidence for pleiotropy between midlife (premorbid) 
cognitive performance and genetic variants of specific 
diseases, including coronary heart disease, ischaemic 
stroke, and Alzheimers’ disease.74  Whether this is evi-
dence for biological pleiotropy (thus supporting bodily 
system integrity theory) or a causal pathway from 
genetic variant to disease outcome, mediated by cogni-
tive ability and subsequent health risk behaviours and/
or occupational hazards, is the subject of ongoing work 
with Mendelian randomisation methods.75 There is the 
additional prospect of interaction between health risk 
behaviours and genetic markers for disease in explain-
ing health differentials attributed to variation in intelli-
gence, and none of these possibilities is mutually 
exclusive.
Because of the widely different causes of death in our 
study, there is no assumption of a “one size fits all” 
explanation of the observed effects. The association 
between premorbid intelligence and specific external 
causes of death warrants in depth and separate cover-
age. The specific association between premorbid intel-
ligence and risk of suicide in men, for example, might 
need to be included in risk models alongside other psy-
chosocial factors, such as the modifying effects of psy-
chosis66  and high achieving parents,46  and the 
potentially confounding and mediating effects of 
depression and anxiety disorders76  and antisocial per-
sonality.13 
15  Furthermore, risk of suicide might be asso-
ciated with premorbid intelligence through reduced 
opportunities in the job market, putting a greater strain 
on men than women in our society. Other cause specific 
mortalities, however, could be usefully studied together 
in their association with premorbid intelligence.

For example, the underlying mechanisms in the associ-
ation between premorbid intelligence and risk of mor-
tality from dementia could have commonality with 
those of coronary heart disease and stroke. In support 
of this, previous evidence indicates that the effect on 
total dementia is driven by associations with vascular 
dementia and not Alzheimer’s disease.54  Furthermore, 
that risk of dementia mortality relates to premorbid 
intelligence for late onset but not early onset cases55—
which tend to have a higher genetic component—might 
implicate health behaviours and lifestyle factors.
Conclusions
We have been able to report on the strength of associa-
tion between premorbid intelligence and a range of spe-
cific causes of death in a full population and with 
follow-up from childhood to near the end of the life 
course. The specialty of cognitive epidemiology remains 
in a growth period; therefore it is premature to make 
recommendations to practitioners and policymakers, 
though we have made a start on that elsewhere.18 
Although we report that smoking and socioeconomic 
status are unlikely to fully mediate the observed associ-
ations, future studies would benefit from measures of 
the cumulative load of such risk factors over the life 
course. Finally, we highlight to researchers active in this 
specialty our robust findings of the association between 
premorbid intelligence and lifetime risk of mortality 
from coronary heart disease, stroke, smoking related 
cancers, respiratory disease, digestive related disease, 
external causes, and dementia, specifically the rela-
tively strong lifetime associations with smoking related 
diseases. We also emphasise the marginally greater 
associated risks among women for coronary heart dis-
ease, smoking related cancers, respiratory disease, and 
dementia, which might indicate sex differential effects 
of intelligence on modifiable risk factors of disease.
