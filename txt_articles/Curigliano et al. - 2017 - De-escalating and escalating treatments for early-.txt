 The 15th St. Gallen International Breast Cancer Conference 2017 in Vienna, Austria reviewed substantial new evidence on loco-regional
and systemic therapies for early breast cancer. Treatments were assessed in light of their intensity, duration and side-effects, seeking
where appropriate to escalate or de-escalate therapies based on likely benefits as predicted by tumor stage and tumor biology.
The Panel favored several interventions that may reduce surgical morbidity, including acceptance of 2mm margins for DCIS, the
resection of residual cancer (but not baseline extent of cancer) in women undergoing neoadjuvant therapy, acceptance of sentinel
node biopsy following neoadjuvant treatment of many patients, and the preference for neoadjuvant therapy in HER2 positive and
triple-negative, stage II and III breast cancer. The Panel favored escalating radiation therapy with regional nodal irradiation in high-risk
patients, while encouraging omission of boost in low-risk patients. The Panel endorsed gene expression signatures that permit
avoidance of chemotherapy in many patients with ER positive breast cancer. For women with higher risk tumors, the Panel escalated
recommendations for adjuvant endocrine treatment to include ovarian suppression in premenopausal women, and extended therapy
for postmenopausal women. However, low-risk patients can avoid these treatments. Finally, the Panel recommended bisphosphonate
use in postmenopausal women to prevent breast cancer recurrence. The Panel recognized that recommendations are not intended
for all patients, but rather to address the clinical needs of the majority of common presentations. Individualization of adjuvant therapy
means adjusting to the tumor characteristics, patient comorbidities and preferences, and managing constraints of treatment cost and
access that may affect care in both the developed and developing world.
Key words: St Gallen Consensus, early breast cancer, radiation therapy, surgery, systemic adjuvant therapies
Introduction
The 15th St. Gallen International Breast Cancer Consensus
Conference was held in March 2017 in Vienna, Austria. This
meeting is a global, multidisciplinary conference with representa-
tives from 160 nations and every continent. The highlight of the
conference is the consensus panel, in which 52 panelists review
and discuss specific areas of treatment with a focus on controver-
sies in the management of early-stage breast cancer. The goal of
this consensus process is to articulate important themes in man-
agement, and to provide guidance to clinicians around the world
on how to think about and care for women with early-stage breast
cancer. It is acknowledged that not all countries have equal access
to therapeutic and diagnostic resources. In light of that, the Panel
attempts to review less costly alternatives when they may be ap-
propriately utilized (Table 1).
The theme for this year’s conference was to focus on areas of ‘es-
calation’ or ‘de-escalation’. That is—to identify areas where opti-
mal care may be achieved with ‘less’ or ‘more’ treatment. The
Panelists believe very strongly in the importance of evidence-based
clinical care. At the same time, they recognize that data from
randomized phase III studies are not always relevant to specific
situations and may not be available to resolve important clinical
decisions. The needs of a specific patient may be better defined
through consideration of subset analyses or other individualized
approaches to care. In these instances, the Panel voiced its expert
judgment in order to assist in the care of individual women as best
they could. The panel endorses treatment in well-designed clinical
trials allowing access to best available care.
Ductal carcinoma in situ
Breast conserving surgery followed by radiation therapy re-
mains the standard of care for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)
[1, 2] assuming adequate margins can be obtained. The majority
of panel endorsed recent Surgical Society of Oncology (SSO),
American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and American
Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) guidelines that rec-
ommended that a margin �2 mm is sufficient to avoid re-
excision [3]. A substantial minority of the panel would accept
narrower margins in individual cases, including ‘no ink on
DCIS’. The Panel acknowledged the recent trials showing that
either aromatase inhibitors (AIs) or tamoxifen can be an effect-
ive adjuvant treatment options to lower the risk of recurrent
DCIS [4, 5].
Primary surgery for early breast cancer
The Panel discussed whether women with multifocal (multiple
areas of tumor in one quadrant) or multicentric (multiple areas
of tumor affecting more than one quadrant) are candidates for
breast conservation. The Panel strongly endorsed breast conser-
vation for both multifocal and multicentric disease provided
that surgical margins are negative, that radiotherapy is antici-
pated, and that the surgical resection would achieve adequate
cosmesis. The Panel reiterated the ‘no ink on tumor’ rule for
surgical margins of invasive breast cancer, and recommended
this standard regardless of tumor biology or subtype [6].
A meta-analysis of single-center experiences suggests very low
risk of local-regional recurrence following nipple-sparing mast-
ectomy [7]. Based on these observations, the Panel endorsed
nipple-sparing mastectomy as an appropriate surgical option.
Additionally, the Panel specifically endorsed nipple-sparing
mastectomy as an option for breast surgery in women with
known hereditary BRCA1/2 mutations provided that there was
careful review of the retro-areolar tissue by pathology with no
evidence for tumor in that region.
Based on the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group
(ACOSOG) Z-11 trial, it has become standard to avoid axillary
dissection in women with 1 or 2 positive sentinel lymph nodes
who have had breast conservation and will be receiving whole
breast radiation and adjuvant systemic therapy, regardless of
tumor biology [8]. The Panel believed that either standard ‘tan-
gents’ or ‘high tangents’ were appropriate radiation fields for
such cases, and had no specific preference.
The Panel discussed how this experience relates to women who
have had mastectomy. The Panel recommended additional ther-
apy to the axilla in women who had had mastectomy and sentinel

Field of treatment
Findings and implications
Genetics
Multi-gene panel testing for hereditary breast cancer becomes widespread, frequently identifying deleterious mutations in
women with family history but negative BRCA1/2 testing, and also introducing substantial numbers of variants of un-
known significance [46].
Surgery of ductal carcinoma
in situ
Meta-analysis and expert panel recommends �2 mm margins as optimal for women receiving breast conserving surgery
and radiation therapy for DCIS [3].
Systemic therapy of ductal
carcinoma in situ (DCIS)
Randomized trials comparing the aromatase inhibitor (AI), anastrozole, against tamoxifen as treatment of estrogen receptor
(ER) positive DCIS showed that the AI was at least as effective as tamoxifen, with differences in side-effect profiles [4, 5].
Surgery of the axilla after
neoadjuvant therapy
Prospective trials of sentinel node vs axillary node dissection for women with node-positive breast cancer following neoadju-
vant chemotherapy showed that false-negative rates for sentinel lymph node (SLN) were in excess of 10%. However, the
SLN mapping may be acceptable in selected cohorts [11–13].
Partial breast irradiation
In a randomized trial of low-risk patients with early breast cancer who received breast conserving surgery, accelerated partial
breast irradiation was not inferior to standard whole breast irradiation [47].
Regional nodal irradiation
Randomized trials demonstrate reduced local-regional and distant metastatic recurrence, with emerging survival advantage,
for regional nodal irradiation to supraclavicular, axillary and internal mammary lymph nodes when treating high-risk breast
cancers following breast surgery. While reducing risk of recurrence, regional nodal irradiation was associated with greater
risk of toxicity and may complicate reconstructive surgery [20, 21].
Neoadjuvant therapy:
Chemotherapy
The inclusion of carboplatin with anthracycline- and taxane-based chemotherapy improved the rate of pathologic complete
response (pCR) in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and translated into disease-free survival benefit though the role for
such treatment when patients additionally receive standard alkylator therapy is less clear [48]. In an adaptive randomized
trial, the addition of carboplatin and the PARP inhibitor, veliparib, improved the rate of pCR in TNBC [49]. There were in-
consistent findings for the use of nab-paclitaxel instead of paclitaxel as neoadjuvant chemotherapy [50, 51].
Neoadjuvant therapy—
HER2 targeted therapy
Long-term follow-up of NeoSphere trial suggests disease-free survival advantage parallels increased rate of pCR with pertu-
zumab- and trastuzumab-based therapy [52]. The antibody–drug conjugate, ado-trastuzumab emtansine paired with per-
tuzumab was less effective at achieving pCR than the chemotherapy–trastuzumab–pertuzumab TCHP [53]. An adaptive
randomized trial suggested that the dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor neratinib, might improve rates of pCR compared with
trastuzumab-based regimens though this awaits confirmation [54].
Neoadjuvant therapy—
endocrine therapy.
The addition of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors to aromatase inhibitor treatment dramatically suppresses
tumor cell proliferation [55–57]. Among women with low genomic scores, neoadjuvant endocrine therapy is associated
with high rates of clinical response [58].
Post-neoadjuvant ther-
apy—clinical trials
Ongoing trials are evaluating post-neoadjuvant therapy for patients who have residual cancer. Agents under investigation in-
clude CDK 4/6 inhibitors, poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, platinum agents, ado-trastuzumab emtansine, im-
munotherapy agents, and others. Adjuvant capecitabine may reduce recurrence in women with residual cancer after
neoadjuvant chemotherapy [42].
Adjuvant therapy—
Chemotherapy
The ABC trials suggest that inclusion of anthracylines in addition to taxanes and alkylator chemotherapy remains valuable for
triple-negative and stage II/III ER positive cancers treated with adjuvant chemotherapy [59]. The addition of bevacizumab
to chemotherapy did not improve long-term outcomes for triple-negative breast cancer [60]. Adjuvant capecitabine may
reduce recurrence in TNBC when added to anthracycline- and taxane-based chemotherapy [61], and may reduce recur-
rence in women with residual cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy [42]. ‘Dose-dense’ chemotherapy scheduling is vali-
dated for reducing cancer recurrence while 5-fluorouracil was shown to not affect recurrence risk [62, 63].
Adjuvant therapy—HER2
targeted therapy
Despite multiple trials demonstrating enhanced rates of pCR with the addition of lapatinib to trastuzumab-based neoadju-
vant chemotherapy, long-term findings from the ALTTO study do not suggest reduced recurrence risk with adjuvant lapa-
tinib [64]. The ExtaNet study suggests that extended anti-HER2 treatment with the dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor, neratinib,
reduces recurrence risk, particularly in ER positive, HER2 positive tumors but is associated with significant rates of diarrhea
[65]. Trastuzumab reduced risk even in small, sub-centimeter, node-negative breast cancers [66]. Paclitaxel and trastuzu-
mab is an effective regimen for stage I breast cancers with low rates of recurrence [67]. Dual blockade with pertuzumab
and trastuzumab improves outcome among patients who are at higher risk for relapse because of lymph-node involve-
ment or hormone-receptor negativity [90].
Adjuvant therapy—endo-
crine therapy
In premenopausal women with ER positive breast cancer, ovarian suppression reduces recurrence in high-risk tumors but is
associated with more menopausal symptoms [32, 68]. In postmenopausal women, multiple trials have studied extended
endocrine therapy with an aromatase inhibitor and have shown reduced rates of breast cancer events, including distant
recurrence and contralateral breast cancers though the absolute benefit is modest [38, 41]. Randomized trials show
equivalence between anastrozole and letrozole as adjuvant treatment [69].
Gene expression profiling
for early-stage breast
cancer: prospective
studies
In the MINDACT trial, a 70-gene signature paired with clinical risk criteria identified patients with breast cancer who did not
derive substantial benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy [23]. In the TAILORx and West German Plan B trials, a very low 21-
gene recurrence score identified a cohort of patients with ER positive breast cancer and an excellent prognosis with endo-
crine therapy alone [24, 25].

 node biopsy with macro-metastases affecting one or two lymph
nodes. The Panel believed that either postsurgical radiation ther-
apy or axillary dissection would be appropriate for such patients.
Breast surgery following neoadjuvant
therapy
Neoadjuvant therapy serves two main goals. It provides effective
systemic treatment (equivalent to adjuvant therapy) to prevent
cancer recurrence, and allows de-escalating surgery for many
women with larger tumors and/or axillary nodal involvement.
The Panel addressed the question: ‘Should the entire area of the
original primary be resected after neoadjuvant therapy or should
the resection include only the residual area of tumor?’, and the
panel deliberated about the appropriate surgical margins follow-
ing neoadjuvant treatment [9]. The Panel recommended that the
extent of residual tumor guide the extent of breast surgery, and
that full resection of the initial tumor bed was not necessary. In
general, the Panel favored the ‘no ink on tumor’ standard for sur-
gical margins following neoadjuvant therapy. However, in cases
of multifocal residual disease and/or cases of ‘scattered’ residual
disease, many panelists expressed an expert opinion to favor
more ‘generous’ margins. No single standard of care exists and
the multidisciplinary team caring for the patient needs to exercise
appropriate clinical judgment. Similarly, the Panel agreed that
nipple-sparing mastectomy was an option for patients following
neoadjuvant treatment provided the retro-areolar region lacked
tumor involvement [10].
Axillary surgery following neoadjuvant
therapy
The Panel deliberated on appropriate axillary surgery following
neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In a woman who presented with a
clinically negative axilla and who received neoadjuvant treatment,
the Panel strongly believed sentinel node biopsy to be appropriate
and favored the biopsy be carried out after neoadjuvant treatment.
There was more controversy regarding sentinel node surgery for
women who presented with a clinically positive axilla, and had a
clinical response with down staging to a clinically negative axilla.
The Panel believed sentinel node biopsy, as opposed to axillary dis-
section, to be adequate if at least three or more negative sentinel
nodes were detected and examined [11–14]. Because of concerns
for false-negative results with limited sampling, sentinel node sur-
gery was generally considered not adequate if only one or two
negative sentinel nodes were identified. The Panel recommended
that patients with a clinically positive axilla or with macro-
metastases identified in sentinel nodes after neoadjuvant therapy
undergo completion axillary dissection [15]. The Panel was split
on whether residual micro-metastatic lymph node involvement
warranted completion dissection after neoadjuvant therapy.
Radiation therapy after breast surgery
Because of high levels of evidence for safety and long-term efficacy,
the Panel believed that hypo-fractionated treatment was an appro-
priate standard for the majority of patients, particularly those over
age 50 years, and that this represented an opportunity for
Table 1. Continued
Field of treatment
Findings and implications
Bone modifying therapy
A meta-analysis of adjuvant bisphosphonate therapy trials demonstrated reduced risk of recurrence in postmenopausal
women [43]. Denosumab can reduce the risk of bone fracture and may reduce recurrence risk in postmenopausal women
[44].
Survivorship
Prospective studies suggest that scalp cooling devices may reduce the incidence of alopecia in women with early-stage
breast cancer receiving non-anthracycline-based chemotherapy [70, 45]. Interventions including exercise or duloxetine
may reduce aromatase inhibitor-associated arthralgias [71].
Metastatic disease—
immunotherapy
Anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1)/Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibodies have shown activity as single-agents or in
combination with taxane-based chemotherapy in TNBC [72–74].
Metastatic disease—CDK4/6
inhibitors
Randomized trials have shown that adding CDK4/6 inhibitors to first- or second line endocrine therapy improves progression
free survival [75–77].
Metastatic disease—HER2
directed therapy
First-line therapy with ado-trastuzumab emtansine and pertuzumab was not superior to chemotherapy and trastuzumab or
ado-trastuzumab emtansine, alone [78]. Adding pertuzumab to second-line chemotherapy in patients not previously
treated with pertuzumab yielded small clinical benefit [79]. In the PERTAIN trial, adding pertuzumab to first-line trastuzu-
mab and endocrine therapy improved progression free survival [80].
Molecular mechanisms of
resistance to therapy
Activating mutations in the estrogen receptor ESR1 gene arise in 30%–40% of recurrences on AI therapy and likely account
for resistance to AI treatment in those cases [81].
BRCA-associated metastatic
breast cancer
BRCA-mutated tumors show preferential benefit for carboplatin-based chemotherapy in palliation of metastatic disease [82].
The addition of veliparib to carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy did not meaningfully improve outcomes in BRCA-
associated advanced breast cancer [83]. Preliminary data from the Olympia D trial suggest that olaparib is a more effective
treatment of BRCA-associated advanced breast cancer than non-platinum chemotherapy options.
Metastatic disease—phos-
phatidylinositol-4,5-
bisphosphate 3-kinase
(PI3KC)
PI3K mutations are common in advanced breast cancer. Randomized trials are evaluating the addition of PI3K inhibitors to
endocrine therapy. These agents vary in their targeting of PI3K isoforms, and the trials differ in their inclusion and assess-
ment of tumors by PI3K mutation status. To date, there are no clinically compelling outcomes from these studies [84–86].
There may be more activity with more alpha-selective agents in tumors with PI3K mutations.

 treatment de-escalation [16]. The Panel also recognized partial
breast irradiation as an option for women meeting the low-risk crite-
ria put forward by the ASTRO/European Society for Radiotherapy
and Oncology (ESTRO) guideline though acknowledged that there
was less evidence for this approach [17]. For women with intermedi-
ate or higher clinical risk, the Panel preferred whole breast irradi-
ation. In another instance of de-escalation, the Panel believed that
‘boost’ could be omitted in patients aged�60, with low grade tumor
features and/or favorable tumor biology who will be taking adjuvant
endocrine therapy [18, 19].
Two recent randomized trials have shown improved oncological
outcomes in terms of disease free survival for regional nodal irradi-
ation (RNI) for women with higher risk breast cancers [20, 21].
The Panel recommended RNI in patients with pN1 (one to three
positive nodes) cancers and adverse clinical features including
young age (�40 years), adverse biology such as low or negative es-
trogen receptor (ER) expression, high grade features, and extensive
lympho-vascular invasion (LVI), and all patients with four or
more positive lymph nodes. For women pN1 with lower risk fea-
tures the potential benefits of RNI should be weighed against risks
for toxicity, including pneumonitis and lymphedema. The Panel
recommended post-mastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) in all
patients with four or more positive lymph nodes and/or pT3
tumors. For pN1 with lower risk features the use of PMRT should
be weighed against risks for toxicity, including increased of com-
plications following breast reconstruction.
Table 2 summarizes treatment recommendations for loco-
regional therapies.
The Panel acknowledged the limited data for tailored radiation
therapy based on neoadjuvant treatment response, and recom-
mended that both baseline and post-treatment cancer stage be
considered in planning whether and how to administer radiation
therapy. Finally, in the sentinel node-era, it is likely that radiation
treatment decisions will need to be made with less complete stag-
ing information. Ongoing clinical trials including the National
Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-51 and
Alliance A11202 studies will inform this decision.
Characterization of tumor biology,
subtypes, and genomic signatures
The St. Gallen Consensus has for years led in the development of
treatment tailored toward clinical and biological subsets of breast
cancer. In broad clinical terms, there are four subtypes of breast
cancer that call for distinct treatment approaches: triple-negative
tumors, for which chemotherapy is both effective and the only
available therapy; HER2 positive tumors regardless of ER status,
for which anti-HER2 therapy and chemotherapy are indicated;
and two types of ER positive breast cancer, both of which are
treated with endocrine therapy. For many of these patients with
hormone receptor positive disease, chemotherapy can be omit-
ted. ER and progesterone receptor (PR) status is determined by
immunohistochemistry (IHC); human epidermal growth factor
receptor (HER2) status is determined by IHC and/or in situ hy-
bridization assays. In addition, tumors are characterized by grade
and proliferative fraction (most commonly assessed by Ki-67
immunostaining), factors that may affect the recommendation
for chemotherapy in ER positive tumors (Table 3). The Panel
raised an issue of caution about reproducibility of IHC for Ki67 and
its use to make clinical decisions, due to the variability of this assay.
If used, panelists suggested to calibrate a common scoring method
in order to achieve high inter-laboratory reproducibility in Ki67
scoring on centrally stained tissue microarray slides [88, 89].
Although these data are potentially encouraging, suggesting that it
may be possible to standardize scoring of Ki67 among pathology
laboratories, clinically important discrepancies persist. The Panel
recommended against routine reporting of tumor infiltrating
lymphocytes for early breast cancer.
As a clinical ‘short-hand’, tumors are often classified as ‘luminal-
A like’ or ‘luminal-B like’ based on routine pathology. Luminal
A-like tumors are typically low grade, strongly ER/PR positive,
HER2 negative and have low proliferative fraction. Luminal-B-like
tumors are ER positive but may have variable degrees of ER/PR ex-
pression, are higher grade, and have higher proliferative fraction.
The Panel acknowledged that these classifications based on routine
histopathology were clinically valuable, and could be used to inform
adjuvant treatment decisions. Specifically, the panel agreed that ei-
ther grading or Ki-67 could be used to distinguish between the
Luminal—A- and B-like (Table 3).
However, the panel agreed that, when available, gene expres-
sion signatures were preferable to standard pathology, when ad-
equate reproducibility is not granted. There was considerable
discussion concerning the indication for gene expression signa-
tures [22]. The panel agreed that there was no role in clinical low
risk cases [such as pT1a/b, grade 1 (G1), ER high, N0] and similar
settings where chemotherapy would not be indicated under any
circumstances. The Panel agreed that a number of gene expres-
sion signatures served as prognostic markers in the setting of ad-
juvant endocrine therapy in node-negative breast cancers,
including the 21 gene recurrence score, the 70 gene signature, the
PAM50 ROR scoreV
R, the EpClin scoreV
R, and the Breast Cancer
IndexV
R. The Panel endorsed all of these assays for guiding the de-
cision on adjuvant chemotherapy in node-negative tumors as
they all identify node-negative cases at low risk, with an excellent
prognosis that would not warrant chemotherapy [23–27].
Nodal status is a strong prognostic factor regardless of gene
expression signature. The Panel agreed that gene expression sig-
natures offered information that can refine the prognosis for
node-positive breast cancers. However, the Panel did not uni-
formly endorse the use of gene expression signatures for making
treatment decisions regarding adjuvant chemotherapy in node-
positive cases. The 21-gene recurrence score and the 70-gene sig-
nature have now been evaluated in prospective studies including
small numbers of node-positive cancers. In the prospective trial
(MINDACT), only patients with node-negative, or one to three
positive nodes were included. Patients with low-risk tumor scores
and a limited degree of nodal involvement appear to have a good
prognosis with or without chemotherapy [28, 29].
The Panel reviewed similar data showing that some gene ex-
pression signatures appear to be prognostic for late recurrence
of ER positive breast cancers after 5 years of adjuvant endocrine
therapy [30, 31]. However, the Panel did not recommend the
use of gene expression signatures for choosing whether to rec-
ommend extended adjuvant endocrine treatment, as no pro-
spective data exist and the retrospective data were not
considered sufficient to justify the routine use of genomic assays
in this setting.

 The Panel discussed the routine indications for multigene test-
ing in ER positive breast cancer. The principal role is to recom-
mend for or against adjuvant chemotherapy. In patients who are
not candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy owing to comorbid
health conditions or tumor stage/risk, or in patients who ‘obvi-
ously’ need adjuvant chemotherapy, typically including stage III
breast cancer, there is no routine need for genomic tests. In gen-
eral, the zone ‘in between’ is where genomic assays may be most
valuable. These would often be patients with tumors between 1
and 3 cm, with zero to two or three positive lymph nodes, and
intermediate proliferative fraction. Multigene assay should not
be the only factor considered in making a decision to proceed or
to avoid chemotherapy. This broad description is intended to
give guidance to clinicians and was not intended to deny access of
patients with other clinical presentation where the refined prog-
nosis available by genomic assay might reasonably inform the ad-
juvant chemotherapy decision.
Adjuvant endocrine therapy:
premenopausal women
Tamoxifen is the historical standard adjuvant endocrine therapy
for premenopausal women. The Panel reviewed data from recent
trials of adjuvant ovarian function suppression (OFS) that dem-
onstrated that OFS can lower the risk of breast cancer recurrence
in higher risk cancers [32]. The Panel identified age �35 and/or
involvement of 4 or more lymph nodes as factors arguing for in-
clusion of OFS. In general, based on published reports, women
with sufficient tumor risk so as to warrant chemotherapy may
wish to consider OFS. The Panel believed OFS could be paired
with either tamoxifen or an AI (Table 4) [33, 34]. Chemotherapy
may cause transient or permanent menopause in younger
women. The Panel urged caution when interpreting laboratory
assays of pituitary—ovarian function such as estradiol, follicle-
stimulating hormone, or luteinizing hormone levels in women
treated with chemotherapy, and encouraged use of gonado-
tropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy to achieve
OFS when there was any clinical ambiguity regarding menstrual
function, particularly if an AI is administered (Table 4).
Adjuvant endocrine therapy:
postmenopausal women
A vast literature supports the use of tamoxifen or AIs in the adju-
vant treatment of postmenopausal women. Large randomized
trials have shown that initial treatment with AIs may reduce re-
currence risk and improve survival compared with tamoxifen
alone. The Panel noted that tamoxifen alone is still appropriate
for some patients. Slightly more than half of the panelists believed
that an AI should be used at some point during the course of ad-
juvant therapy. Factors that favored the use of an AI include node
positivity, high Ki67, high grade, lobular histology, and HER2
positivity. In women at high risk of recurrence, the panel favored
the use of an AI as initial therapy. The Panel acknowledge that the
importance of patient preference and tolerability of therapy, par-
ticularly given the modest differences between tamoxifen and AIs
even in somewhat high-risk patients (Table 4) [36, 37].
Over the past decade, multiple trials have examined the role
of extended adjuvant endocrine therapy beyond 5 years of treat-
ment. Options include extended tamoxifen to 10 years, ex-
tended AI therapy to 10 years, or 5 years of tamoxifen and then
switching to an AI. The benefits of extended therapy include re-
ductions in risk of loco-regional and distant recurrence and in
contralateral breast cancer. The Panel deliberated on which
women should receive longer durations of therapy. In general,
the Panel recommended longer durations in women with mod-
erate to high risk of recurrence, typically defined as stage II or III
breast cancer. In women with stage I cancers, the Panel favored
only 5 years of treatment (Table 4). Based on data from recently
presented studies, the Panel was more inclined to recommend
extended therapy in women who had received tamoxifen as ini-
tial therapy, and in women where secondary prevention was an
important treatment goal [38–41]. The Panel underscored the
importance of patient preference and tolerability in this treat-
ment decision, as extended therapy is associated with ongoing
menopausal symptoms and risks to bone health, and yields only
modest benefits in terms of preventing breast cancer recurrence,
especially in patients who have completed 5 years of AI therapy
(Table 4).
The Panel recommended that premenopausal women who
are at high risk for recurrence and have concluded 5 years of
tamoxifen should extend endocrine therapy for up to 10 years
(Table 4) [35].
Which patients should receive adjuvant
chemotherapy?
Triple-negative breast cancer
The Panel recommended adjuvant chemotherapy for triple-nega-
tive breast cancer (TNBC) stage T1b pN0 and higher; the major-
ity recommended against routine adjuvant chemotherapy for
pT1a pN0 TNBC (Table 4). The Panel preferred anthracycline-
and taxane-based chemotherapy for most patients, but particu-
larly for those with stage II and III disease. The Panel clearly rec-
ommended against routine use of platinum-based chemotherapy
in unselected TNBC cases. In BRCA1/2 associated cancers, the
Panel was evenly split on whether to recommend adjuvant plat-
inum chemotherapy though agreed that such patients should re-
ceive alkylating chemotherapy in addition to a taxane and
anthracycline. Acceptable regimens included dose-dense and
non-dose-dense anthracycline-, taxane-, and alkylator chemo-
therapy schedules (Table 5).
HER2 positive breast cancer
The Panel recommended adjuvant chemotherapy and anti-HER2
therapy for HER2 positive, stage pT1b pN0 and higher breast can-
cers; it recommended against routine adjuvant chemotherapy
and anti-HER2 therapy for pT1a pN0 HER2 positive breast can-
cers. The Panel believed that the paclitaxel–trastuzumab regimen
was sufficient for most stage 1, HER2 positive cancer but recom-
mended anti-HER2 therapy be paired with additional chemo-
therapy agents for stage II or III cancer (Table 5).

 The Panel recommended a duration of 1 year of adjuvant trastu-
zumab alone, based on current evidence (Table 5). At the time of
the Consensus Conference data of APHINITY trial were not avail-
able. In women who received neoadjuvant anti-HER2 therapy with
dual blockade pertuzumab and trastuzumab, the Panel recom-
mended completion of one year of trastuzumab alone but did not
recommend adjuvant pertuzumab based on current evidence.
The majority of the Panel endorsed adjuvant use of adequately
evaluated biosimilar trastuzumab, according to the criteria of ex-
trapolation defined between regulatory agencies.
There is evidence from a single randomized trial that ex-
tended adjuvant therapy with neratinib after 1 year of trastuzu-
mab may reduce recurrence in HER2 positive breast cancer,
particularly in ER positive, HER2 positive cancers. The Panel
did not specifically address the role of this agent pending further
study (Table 5).
ER positive, HER2 negative breast cancer
Treatment decisions for chemotherapy in ER positive breast can-
cers can be guided by either IHC/pathology or by gene expression
signatures. The Panel identified traditional pathology factors as
relative indications for adjuvant chemotherapy including node-
positive stage, extensive LVI, high Ki-67, and low hormone-
receptor expression. The role of young age, per se, as an indica-
tion for chemotherapy was less strongly endorsed given the grow-
ing appreciation for tumor biology as the determinant of
outcome and the potential role for ovarian suppression.
The Panel recommended against adjuvant chemotherapy in
women with stage 1 or 2, luminal-A-like cancers (strongly ER and
PR positive, HER2 negative, with lower grade and proliferation
markers), especially when genomic assays predicted the lack of
benefit for chemotherapy treatment. The Panel recommended
against adjuvant chemotherapy in women with luminal-B-like
tumors with low genomic risk scores on the 21- or 70-gene signa-
tures, when presenting with limited nodal involvement [23–25].
Some of the panelists urged caution about withholding adjuvant
chemotherapy in node positive patients until more gene expres-
sion data in women treated with and without chemotherapy are
available that will allow to safely de-escalate treatment in the ERþ/
HER2 negative, N1-3 subset. In cases of intermediate genomic
scores or greater, the Panel recommended chemotherapy in

 luminal-B-like and/or node-positive cancers. The Panel preferred
standard anthracycline- and taxane-based chemotherapy for most
patients with ER positive breast cancer warranting chemotherapy.
Neoadjuvant therapy and post-neoadjuvant
therapy
The Panel strongly endorsed the use of neoadjuvant therapy for
stage II or III, HER2 positive or triple-negative breast cancer as
the preferred initial treatment approach, particularly when there
is any suggestion that treatment response might enable de-
escalation of surgery or radiotherapy. For HER2 positive cancers,
the Panel endorsed dual anti-HER2 neoadjuvant therapy with
pertuzumab and trastuzumab with chemotherapy as a commonly
administered option. For triple-negative cancers, the Panel rec-
ommended similar approaches to those that would be used in ad-
juvant therapy (Table 5).
Patients with residual cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy
are at greater risk for recurrence than those who achieve complete
pathologic response. At this juncture, there are no published data
that additional therapy—beyond ‘standard’ treatment—reduces
recurrence risk in women with residual disease [42]. The Panel
was ambivalent about the role of additional therapy in the post-
neoadjuvant setting, and there was no consensus on whether add-
itional therapy should routinely be added, or which treatment
might be preferred. A recent trial used capecitabine in this setting
with very encouraging results, but the panelists noted the absence
of confirmatory data and the historical lack of substancial benefit
for adjuvant capecitabine. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating
the role of therapeutic escalation with various treatments includ-
ing additional chemotherapies, targeted agents, anti-HER2 thera-
pies, PARP inhibitors, and immune checkpoint inhibitors in this
setting.
Adjuvant use of bone modifying therapy
Based on a meta-analysis of multiple trials, the Panel strongly
endorsed the use of bisphosphonates as adjuvant treatment of
postmenopausal women with breast cancer [43, 87]. Preferred
regimens include zoledronic acid every 6 months for 5 years, or
daily oral clodronate for 3 years. The Panel recommended against
such treatments for premenopausal women who are continuing
to have regular menstrual cycles. However, a majority of the
Panel favored this option for premenopausal women receiving
OFS. Denosumab has been shown to reduce bone-health related
events in breast cancer patients and may reduce recurrence but
only a minority of panelists favored the option of substituting
denosumab for bisphosphonates [43, 44].
Survivorship and quality of life
The Panel endorsed scalp cooling devices to reduce the likelihood
of alopecia related to neo/adjuvant chemotherapy with non-
anthracycline regimens [45].
The Panel endorsed lifestyle, diet, and weight management
strategies appropriate to the general population, acknowledging
that there are as yet no data that specific diet, lifestyle, or weight
interventions affect the risk of breast cancer recurrence.
Considerations in special populations
Elderly patients
The Panel resolutely endorsed the statement that there is no ab-
solute age limit for adjuvant chemotherapy but rather the rec-
ommendation should depend on the health status of the
patient, the risk of cancer recurrence, the likely benefit of ther-
apy, and patient preferences. The Panel acknowledged that
many older patients (greater than age 65 years) with ER positive,
HER2 negative, low clinical and/or genomic risk and taking ad-
juvant endocrine therapy could omit radiation therapy after
breast conserving surgery, particularly those with multiple
comorbid health conditions.
Pregnancy after breast cancer
There are few data to guide the optimal timing of pregnancy
after breast cancer, and this is an important area of ongoing
research. Given the known benefits of adjuvant endocrine ther-
apy, panelists generally favored an approach that involved
18–24 months of treatment with endocrine before pregnancy,
and reiterated the importance of resuming endocrine treatment
after pregnancy.
Male breast cancer
The vast majority of male breast cancers are ER positive. The
Panel recommended that men with ER positive tumors should
receive adjuvant tamoxifen. For men with true contraindications
to tamoxifen, the Panel believed GnRH agonist therapy and an AI
could be an alternative.
Testing for hereditary breast cancer
The Panel endorsed genetic testing of BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 for
patients with strong family history of breast cancer regardless of
age; for women diagnosed at age �40 years regardless of tumor
subtype, or for women with triple-negative breast cancer
age �60 years. Germline multigene panel testing may be offered
to patients who meet criteria for hereditary cancer syndromes,
including breast and ovarian or Lynch syndrome; and is particu-
larly appropriate in cases of early-onset breast cancer or in
women with strong family history of breast cancer when BRCA1/
2 testing has been uninformative.
Discussion
Conclusions
The conference endorsed recent trial evidence supporting areas of
‘escalation’ or ‘de-escalation’ of local and systemic therapies.
A large number of treatment recommendations are shown al-
though a significant variation in the level of agreement was noted.
In fact, among more than 200 questions, only a few statements

 (radiation in 4 or more positive nodes, distinction between lu-
minal A- and luminal B-like in order to identify important clinical
categories) resulted in 100% concordance. The large variation in
the degrees of support is reflected in the votes recorded in supple-
mentary Appendix S1, available at Annals of Oncology online. The
Panel recognized that recommendations are not intended for all
patients, but rather for the majority of them in common clinical
situations. Fine-tuning of adjuvant therapies for the patient of
today implies that the available treatments need to be adjusted to
the patient’s tumor characteristics, co-morbidities, economic con-
straints and acceptance of therapies.
