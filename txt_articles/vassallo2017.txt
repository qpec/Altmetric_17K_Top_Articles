 Objectives Determine the analgesic efficacy and safety profile
of single injection FICB performed in the pre-operative period
for acute pain management in adult patients with traumatic
hip fractures compared to other forms of analgesia.
Methods MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane and CINAHL were
independently searched to identify randomised controlled trials
(RCTs) in English. Patients aged >18 years old who have suf-
fered an isolated traumatic hip fracture (proximal femoral
fracture) and received single injection FICB pre-operatively
were included. No date restriction was applied and key jour-
nals and articles were scrutinised to include studies not identi-
fied by the primary search.
Results Out of 3757 citations, eight RCTs were included in
the final quantitative analysis, comprising of 645 participants.
Acute pain was significantly reduced in FICB during position-
ing
and
movement,
standardised
mean
difference
(SMD)
=�1.82 (95% CI:�2.26 to �1.38, p<0.00001) but was varia-
ble at rest (p=0.20). There was a reduced incidence of analge-
sia
breakthrough
(n=57 versus
n=73),
drowsiness/sedation
(n=1 versus n=22), desaturation (n=0 versus n=4) and nausea
and vomiting (n=3 versus n=7) in the FICB arm. There were
similar numbers of patients across both arms that reported
localised bruising (n=3). Only one study was at low risk of
bias.
Conclusions FICB is superior in controlling acute pre-operative
pain in adult patients with traumatic hip fractures. The benefit
is more evident during positioning and mobilisation of the
limb. FICB has a better safety profile and reduces dependency
on systemic analgesia.

CALPOL: ARE WE OVERDOSING ON BLOOD TESTS?
Brijesh Patel. Birmingham Children’s Hospital
10.1136/emermed-2017-207308.48
Background In February 2012, the Commission on Human
Medicines
recommended
lowering
the
paracetamol
toxicity
treatment threshold for all patients. Children between one
month and six years of age are physiologically distinct and
metabolise paracetamol differently, making them less prone to
toxicity. Furthermore, overdose in early childhood is almost
exclusively accidental, as opposed to predominately deliberate
self harm seen in adults and adolescents. As a result, the use
of the new 75 mg/kg ingestion threshold for young children
would appear to be of unproven benefit, and is substantially
lower than the threshold used in other countries.
Aim To establish the sensitivity and negative predictive value
of using a 150 mg/kg ingestion threshold to identify hepato-
toxicity in children one month to six year old group with
paracetamol overdoses.
Method Retrospective case review. Potential cases were identi-
fied by filtering an electronic Patient Management System for
a discharge diagnosis of ‘accidental ingestions and poisonings’
over the period 1 st January 2012 to 19th October 2016 (57
months). ED documentation was reviewed to identify cases of
paracetamol ingestions by children under the age of 6 years.
Those with intentional harm, known staggered ingestions over
1 hour or under one month age (corrected for gestation) were
excluded.
Clinical notes and laboratory data were reviewed and, data
parameters collated using a standardised proforma. Ingested
doses were estimated, where possible, by subtraction methods.
In some cases, the ingestion time was revised according to the
time that the child was previously seen prior to the ingestion.
A composite outcome for hepatotoxicity was used consisting
firstly
of
the
current
UK
standard
treatment
threshold
(100 mg/L line on paracetamol toxicity nomogram) together
with any evidence of biochemical hepatoxicity or clinical fea-
tures of potential hepatotoxicity at any subsequent ED attend-
ances over the next 7 days.
Results The final cohort consisted of 165 individual patient
ingestions. A 150 mg/kg ingestion threshold had a sensitivity
of 100.0% (95% CI:47.5 to 100.0) for hepatotoxicity, with a
negative predictive value of 100% (95% CI:97.5 to 100.0).
Conclusion This retrospective study supports the hypothesis
that accidental paracetamol ingestions less than 150 mg/kg, in
children one month to six years of age, can be safely man-
aged without investigation or treatment, in accordance with
other international guidance. The use of 150 mg/kg threshold
would reduce testing in over a third of attendances in our
cohort. Study limitations include retrospective bias and the
predominate use of serum paracetamol levels to determine
toxicity.

 (TARN). Traditionally survival from TCA has been reported as
low, with some believing resuscitation is futile. Within the
adult population there is growing evidence to suggest that
with early and aggressive correction of reversible causes, sur-
vival from TCA may be comparable to that seen from medical
out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. Key to this survival has been
the adoption of a standardised approach to resuscitation.
The aim of this study was, by a process of consensus, to
develop a national, standardised algorithm for the management
of paediatric TCA.
Methods A
modified
consensus
development
meeting
was
held. Statements discussed in the meeting were drawn from
those that did not reach consensus (positive/negative) from a
linked three round online Delphi study. Those participants

 completing the first round of the Delphi study were invited
to attend.
19 statements relating to the diagnosis, management and
futility of paediatric TCA were discussed in small groups.
After five minutes the key points from the small groups were
presented to the whole audience. Subsequently, using elec-
tronic voting devices, each participant anonymously recorded
their agreement with the statement using ‘yes’, ‘no’ or ‘don’t
know’. In keeping with our Delphi study, consensus was set a
priori at 70%. Statements reaching consensus were included in
the proposed algorithm.
Results 41 participants attended the consensus development
meeting. Of the 19 statements discussed, 13 reached positive
consensus and were included in the algorithm. A single state-
ment regarding initial rescue breaths reached negative consen-
sus and was excluded. Consensus was not reached for five
statements, including the use of vasopressors and thoracotomy
for haemorrhage control in blunt trauma. The proposed algo-
rithm for the management of paediatric TCA is shown as Fig-
ures 1 and 2 for blunt and penetrating trauma respectively.
Conclusion In attempt to standardise our approach to the
management of paediatric TCA and to improve outcomes, we
present
the
first
algorithm

HOW CAN INFORMAL SUPPORT IMPACT CHILD PTSD
SYMPTOMS FOLLOWING A PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA?
Sarah Halligan. Bath, UK
10.1136/emermed-2017-207308.50
Background An estimated 20% of children who present to
hospital emergency departments following potentially traumatic
events (e.g., serious injuries, road traffic accidents, assaults)
will develop post-traumatic stress disorder as a consequence.
The development of PTSD can have a substantial impact on a
child’s
developmental
trajectory,
including
their
emotional,
social and educational wellbeing. Despite this, only a small
proportion will access mental health services, with the major-
ity relying on informal sources of support. Parents, in particu-
lar, are often the primary source of support. However, it
remains unclear what types of parental responses may be
effective, and parents themselves report experiencing uncer-
tainty about the best approach. To address this gap in knowl-
edge,
we
examined
the
capacity
for
specific
aspects
of
parental responding in the aftermath of child trauma to facili-
tate or hinder children’s psychological recovery.
Method We conducted a longitudinal study of 132 parent-
child
pairs,
recruited
following
the
child’s
experience
of
trauma and subsequent attendance at one of four regional
emergency
departments.
At
an
initial
assessment,
within
1 month post-trauma, we examined how parents appraised
and responded to their child following the event, using both
questionnaires and direct observations. Child-report question-
naires
were
used
to
assess
PTSD
symptom
severity
at
1 month, and at a follow up 6 months later. Children also
reported on their own appraisals of the trauma and their cop-
ing behaviours, which were considered as potential mediators
between parental support and later child symptoms.
Results Controlling for relevant covariates and initial PTSD
symptoms,
parent
negative
appraisals
of
the
trauma
and
encouragement of avoidant coping in children were associated
with higher child-reported PTSD symptoms at 6 month fol-
low-up. There was some evidence that children’s own trauma
related appraisals and coping styles mediated these effects.
Conclusion Findings indicate that children’s social support can
influence
their
post-trauma
psychological
outcomes.
That
parenting was associated with 6 month PTSD, even after con-
trolling for the child’s initial symptoms, suggests that parent-
ing responses in the posttrauma period actively influence the
child’s
poorer
longer-term
adjustment,
rather
than
simply
being a response to the child’s initial distress. The results sug-
gest that helping parents to provide fewer negative appraisals
about
the
trauma/their
child’s
response,
and
to
encourage
more adaptive coping styles, could be effective in improving
child psychological outcomes. As emergency departments pro-
vide primary care and support for families affected by trauma,
they could play an important role in making this advice avail-
able to parents.

Background Recent studies suggest that approximately one per
thousand paediatric ED attendances may require some sort of
critical procedure, with intubation being by far the most com-
mon. It is unknown how often critical non-airway procedures
such as chest decompression, CPR, ED thoracotomy, defibrilla-
tion, pacing, and advanced vascular access techniques are per-
formed by paediatric emergency clinicians.
Objective To determine the recent performance or supervision,
and confidence for various paediatric critical non-airway pro-
cedures by senior paediatric emergency clinicians.
Design/methods Web based survey of senior paediatric emer-
gency clinicians regarding performance, supervision, and confi-
dence relating to critical non-airway procedures in children
aged 0–18 years. The survey was distributed through Paediat-
ric Emergency Research Networks (PERN) in the UK and Ire-
land, USA, Canada, Europe, South America, Australia and
New Zealand.
Results 1602 clinicians responded to the survey, with an over-
all response rate of 65%. 1508 (94%) respondents reported
their most recent non-airway procedural experience. In the
last 12 months, 979 (64%) had personally inserted an intra-
osseous line, 283 (19%) a central venous line, and 265 (18%)
an arterial line. In the same time period, 962 (64%) had per-
formed CPR, 190 (13%) had performed needle thoracostomy,
245 (16%) had performed tube thoracostomy, 380 (25%) had
performed DC cardioversion or defibrillation, and 57 (4%)
had performed transcutaneous pacing. 18 (1%) had performed
pericardiocentesis, 19 (1%) a venous cutdown, and 21 (1%)
ED thoracotomy. More than 70% of respondents had never
supervised or performed pacing, pericardiocentesis, venous cut-
down or ED thoracotomy. 332 (22%) and 348 (23%) had
never performed or supervised insertion of a central venous
line or arterial line respectively.
Procedural confidence for intraosseous lines and CPR was
high, while confidence increased with increasing patient age
