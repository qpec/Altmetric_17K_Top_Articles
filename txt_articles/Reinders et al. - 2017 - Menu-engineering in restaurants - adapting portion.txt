Abstract
Background: The aim of this research was to investigate whether increased portion sizes of vegetables and
decreased portion sizes of meat on main dishes increased the amount of vegetables consumed in a real-life
restaurant setting without affecting customer satisfaction. The participants were unaware of the experiment.
Methods: A cross-over design was used in which three restaurants were randomly assigned to a sequence of an
intervention and control condition. In the intervention period, the vegetable portion sizes on the plates of main
dishes were doubled (150 g of vegetables instead of 75 g) and the portion sizes of meat on the plates were
reduced by an average of 12.5%. In the control period, the portion sizes of the main dishes were maintained as
usual. In total, 1006 observations and questionnaires were included.
Results: Vegetable consumption from plates was significantly higher during the intervention period (M = 115.5 g)
than during the control period (M = 61.7 g). Similarly, total vegetable consumption (including side dishes) was
significantly higher during the intervention period (M = 178.0 g) than during the control period (M = 137.0 g).
Conversely, meat consumption was significantly lower during the intervention period (M = 183.1 g) than during the
control period (M = 211.1 g). Satisfaction with the restaurant visit did not differ between the intervention period
(M = 1.27) and control period (M = 1.35). Satisfaction with the main dish was significantly lower during the
intervention period (M = 1.25) than during the control period (M = 1.38), although in both cases, the scores
indicated that participants remained (very) satisfied with their main dish.
Conclusions: This study showed that increasing vegetable portions in combination with decreasing meat portions
(unknowingly to the consumer) increased the amount of vegetables consumed and decreased the amount of meat
consumed. Furthermore, despite the changes in portion sizes, participants remained satisfied with their restaurant
visit and main dish. The findings of this study suggest that modifying portion size in restaurants is an effective tool
for stimulating vegetable consumption and consequently healthy and sustainable diets.

 Background
Healthy eating and drinking, alongside adequate exer-
cise, is one of the most important ways of growing old
while maintaining health and vitality. In this respect, a
large body of evidence shows that a high vegetable in-
take helps promote health and prevent diet-related
chronic disease [1, 2]. Despite the considerable evidence
that eating vegetables has various health benefits, indi-
viduals consume less than the recommended amount in
most Western countries [3].
This lower intake coincides with an increase in the
number of meals consumed away from home, in restau-
rants or at fast food outlets [4, 5]. Increased consump-
tion outside of the home is associated with increased
intake of large portions of unhealthy, high calorie foods
with fewer vegetables, which may subsequently contrib-
ute to the increasing prevalence of overweight and obes-
ity in Western countries [6, 7]. Furthermore, the volume
of meat consumed in restaurants is high [8]. This high
level of consumption has presented challenges to food
sustainability, including loss of arable land and biodiversity
[9] and other animal welfare [10], public health [11, 12]
and climate change [13] effects. Therefore, restaurants
could play an important role in mitigating the increase in
overweight and obesity and could improve diet quality by
offering healthier and more sustainable food choices
(i.e., more vegetables, less meat) on their menus [14].
In addition, it could be argued that dietary change in-
terventions can have the greatest impact when they
are conducted in “limited access” sites, i.e., restau-
rants and canteens, instead of grocery stores, as it is
easier in these settings to sway customers towards
making healthier choices [15].
One way restaurants can promote healthier food
choices is by modifying portion sizes [16]. When people
are served larger portions, they eat more than when they
are offered smaller portions [17]. The results of a field
study by Diliberti et al. showed that portion size signifi-
cantly affected how much food was consumed, while a
satisfaction survey showed no difference in the ratings of
the appropriateness of the two different portions with
higher and lower portion sizes [18]. Others found that
reducing the portion sizes of items in university restau-
rants resulted in reduced dietary intake and also in re-
duced plate waste [19]. An experiment by Wansink et al.
showed that participants who were unknowingly eating
from self-refilling bowls ate more soup than those eating
from normal soup bowls [20]. Despite consuming 73%
more, the participants eating from self-refilling bowls
did not perceive themselves to be more sated, nor did
they believe that they had consumed more than those
eating from normal bowls. The authors argued that the
amount of food on a plate or bowl is associated with the
amount of intake because it influences consumption
norms and expectations. Increasing the size of portions
or the variety of healthy products with a low energy
density, such as vegetables, has also been shown to be
effective in decreasing overall energy intake and promot-
ing healthy eating. Rolls et al. investigated the effects of
varying the portion size and energy density of a first
course salad on overall ad libitum lunch intake [21].
Compared to having no first course, consuming a salad
with the lowest energy density reduced meal intake by
7% (268 kJ) for the small portion and 12% (448 kJ) for the
large portion. Although subjects consumed significantly
less energy at the meal with the large low-energy-dense
salad, they felt similarly full as when they consumed meals
with other large salads. Others showed that having a
choice in the variety of vegetables during a lunch buffet
enhanced healthier food choices [22]. Giving participants
one additional vegetable to choose from increased the
total as well as the relative energy provided by vege-
tables. In contrast, the relative energy derived from
non-vegetables (e.g., pasta and chicken) significantly
decreased. Furthermore, consuming a low-energy-dense
broth-based soup as a first course has also been found to
reduce overall meal intake [23].
This experimental evidence suggests that changing
both portion sizes and the energy density of foods or
menus is potentially effective in maintaining satiety, re-
ducing energy intake and increasing vegetable intake in
the short term. Therefore, the aim of this research is to in-
vestigate whether increased portion sizes of vegetables and
decreased portion sizes of meat1 in a main dish increase
the amount of vegetables consumed in a real-life restaurant
setting without affecting customer’s satisfaction. Further-
more, we examine to what extent the quantity of vegetable
and meat consumption is associated with demographic,
lifestyle and nutrition-related characteristics.
We hypothesized that increasing the portion size of
healthy food products (i.e., vegetables) leads to a higher
consumption of these healthy food products and that
decreasing the portion size of meat will lead to a lower
consumption of meat products. Furthermore, we hypoth-
esized that the adaption of portion sizes will not lead to
a decrease in customer satisfaction. Because eating be-
haviors and also satiety differ between distinct subgroups
in the population, the characteristics of the restaurants’
visitors are included in this study. By considering this in-
formation, we aim to provide insight into the potential
effect of our intervention.
Methods
Context and design
The study was conducted within the public-private part-
nership “Meer groente & fruit voor iedereen” (More veg-
etables and fruit for everyone), which was sponsored by
the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Fresh
Reinders et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity  (2017) 14:41

 Produce Centre. The study started in May 2015 and
was implemented in three restaurant locations of a
major restaurant chain in medium-sized cities in the
Netherlands. The participating restaurants were selected
by convenience sampling, and to obtain a representative
sample, restaurants were distributed throughout different
parts of the Netherlands. Furthermore, the particular res-
taurant chain was selected because it receives guests from
all levels of the population, further enhancing the repre-
sentativeness of the data. To recruit restaurants, an email
was sent that explained the rationale of the study and in-
cluded an invitation to sign up to participate in the study.
After this email, restaurants were called to determine their
interest in participating. After agreeing, the researcher vis-
ited each restaurant to meet and discuss the intervention.
A few weeks before the intervention started, the restau-
rants had to sign an agreement in which they accepted the
study design. During the intervention, restaurants were
phoned weekly by the researcher to discuss the progress
of the intervention.
We used a cross-over design in which each restaurant
was randomly assigned to a sequence of an intervention
or control condition. Location one and three started
with a 6-week control period followed by a 6-week inter-
vention period. Location two started in the opposite dir-
ection. Measurements took place on Saturday evenings
between 6 pm and 10 pm (n = 12 per location).
Sample size
Approximately 400 guests visited the restaurants each
evening. However, only guests who ordered one of the
relevant menu items were included in the study. More-
over, due to the maximum capacity of the research assis-
tants in the kitchen, tables with more than twelve plates
were excluded from our study. This resulted in a total of
2080 unique plates that were measured. After removing
plates that were measured but were not included in the
study (e.g., vegetarian meals, child menus and special of-
ferings (e.g., today’s menu)), 1735 observations remained.
After deleting observations without a completed question-
naire, 1193 observations were left. Of these, 187 question-
naires were excluded due to missing data, resulting in
a total of 1006 observations and questionnaires in-
cluded in this study (control period N = 536, interven-
tion period N = 470).
Intervention description
During the intervention period, the portion sizes of veg-
etables on the plates of main dishes were doubled (150 g
of vegetables instead of 75 g) and the portion sizes of
meat were reduced by an average of 12.5%. In the
control period, the portion sizes of the main dishes
remained as usual.
During the intervention period, the following provi-
sions were applied in all locations:
1. Plate:
a. A mix of vegetables served per plate, prepared in
the same way with the same quantity of
vegetables for every plate (75 g during control
weeks and 150 g during intervention weeks).
b. The same starch product (potato gratin) provided
per plate, with approximately the same quantity
for every plate (same for control and intervention
weeks).
2. Side dish:
a. The same type of vegetables served in every bowl,
prepared in the same way, with approximately the
same quantity of vegetables for each bowl (same
during control and intervention period). The type
of vegetables in the side dish differed from the
vegetable mix on the plate.
b. The same starch product (one fries and one
baked potato) provided for every bowl at
approximately the same quantity (same during
control and intervention weeks).
Procedures
Plate measurements were conducted by two to three
trained research assistants per location on Saturday eve-
nings between 6 pm and 10 pm. First, there was a check
at the beginning of the evening. At least five samples of
each component of the plates (meat or fish, vegetables
and potato gratin) and side dishes (vegetables, fries and
baked potatoes) that were included in the study were
measured on a calibrated scale to measure the weight
before and after preparation of the component. Based on
these measurements, an average weight of each compo-
nent was calculated and was used to obtain the average
serving portion for that specific main dish or side dish.
This check was performed three times during the inter-
vention and three times during the control period. To
serve the correct amount of vegetables (75 g or 150 g) on
the plates of main dishes, customized spoons were used
that corresponded to the correct amount. Furthermore,
the chefs practiced serving the right amount of vegetables
at least five times per evening, and the amount was also
checked by a calibrated scale.
After guests consumed their main dishes, the remaining
amount of vegetables, meat, and potato gratin as well as
the food left over from the side dishes (vegetables, fries,
baked potatoes) were weighed when they returned to the
kitchen. Based on these measurements, vegetable con-
sumption was calculated by subtracting the weight of the
remaining vegetables on the plates returned to the kitchen
from the average amount of vegetables served during the
control (75 g) and intervention (150 g) period. Meat

 consumption was calculated in the same manner by sub-
tracting the weight of the remaining meat on the plates
returned to the kitchen from the average amount of meat
served in the control and intervention period. The re-
search assistants attempted to measure as many of the
plates returned to the kitchen as possible.
Questionnaire
After the waiter/waitress collected the plates, the diners
were asked to participate in a study about the satisfac-
tion and consumption behavior of restaurant customers
conducted in cooperation with Wageningen University
& Research and Stichting Variatie in de Keuken. If they
agreed, they were asked to complete a questionnaire,
which took on average five to ten minutes. The partici-
pants remained unaware of the experiment. Unfortu-
nately, we did not monitor the number of participants
who refused participation, but according to the waiters/
waitresses and research assistants, this number was very
low. Reasons for not participating included that cus-
tomers had already participated, had no time, or felt no
need to participate.
In the questionnaire, participants were first asked to indi-
cate their menu choice (main dish). After that, they indi-
cated their reasons for visiting the restaurant (i.e., business
or leisure), the frequency of visiting the particular restaur-
ant (ranging from ‘4 times a month or more’ to ‘this is the
first time’) and how often they dine out in general (ranging
from ‘4 times a month or more’ to ‘1–2 times a year or
less’). The participants then had to rate their satisfaction
with the consumed main dish on a 5-point Likert scale
ranging from very dissatisfied to very satisfied. Similarly,
they indicated their satisfaction with their visit to the res-
taurant. This item was also rated on a 5-point Likert scale
ranging from very dissatisfied to very satisfied. In addition,
participants were asked to provide their opinion about the
amount of vegetables and meat that was served with their
main dish. These two items were rated on a 5-point Likert
scale ranging from too much to too little. Additionally, par-
ticipants assessed the importance of vegetables when din-
ing, with responses ranging from very unimportant to very
important. Each response for the 5-point Likert scale ques-
tions was scored from −2 to +2. Furthermore, respondents
were asked to complete statements on a 7-point Likert
scale from totally disagree to totally agree about food in-
volvement [24], liking of vegetables [24], and subjective
knowledge about vegetables [25]. Each response on the 7-
point Likert scale was scored from −3 to +3. Finally, demo-
graphic questions were asked, including gender, age, level
of education and having children.
Data analyses
We used descriptive statistics to summarize the partici-
pants' characteristics. Continuous variables were presented
as the means and standard deviations, whereas categorical
variables were presented as relative frequencies. Independ-
ent samples t-tests were used to test whether the
means differed significantly between the intervention
and control groups.
The dependent variables were vegetable consumption
in grams per plate, vegetable consumption in total grams
(plate + side dish), meat/fish consumption and satisfac-
tion with the restaurant visit.
One-way ANOVA revealed significantly differences be-
tween the three locations regarding the dependent vari-
ables, except for vegetable consumption in total grams
(F = 1.24, p > 0.05). Accordingly, we decided to control
for location and incorporated it as an extra factor in the
analyses.
Subsequently,
MANOVAs
were
conducted
with vegetable consumption from the plate, total vege-
table consumption (including side dishes), total meat
consumption, satisfaction with the main dish and satis-
faction with the restaurant as the dependent variables
and the condition (intervention versus control) and loca-
tion as factors.
For subgroups that could be distinguished based on
categorical variables (i.e., gender, having children, reason
for visit), independent samples t-tests were used to test
whether these subgroups differed in the amount of vegeta-
bles and meat consumed. For participant characteristics
that were measured by continuous variables (i.e., age, fre-
quency of visit, frequency of dining out, involvement with
food, liking of vegetables), correlational analyses were used
to test whether there were positive or negative associa-
tions with vegetable and meat consumption.
Results
In total, we included 1006 participants: 536 in the con-
trol condition and 470 in the intervention condition. In
our study sample, 54% were women and 46% were men,
and the age of the respondents ranged from 9 to 88 years
(M = 48.6, SD = 17.5). With regard to education level, ap-
proximately 37% of the respondents reported having a high
education level (i.e., college or university), 28% a medium
education level (i.e., vocational education) and 35% a low
education level (i.e., primary education or secondary edu-
cation). Other baseline characteristics of the sample are de-
scribed in Table 1. In addition, Table 2 shows the means
and standard deviations of the questionnaire items for the
total study population as well as for the control and inter-
vention period. With the exception of the dependent
variables in this study, the independent samples t-tests
revealed no significant differences between the control
period and the intervention period for the measured items.
One exception was the importance of vegetables when din-
ing out; scores for this variable were significantly lower
during the intervention period than the control period, al-
though this question was not related to the intervention.

 Vegetable and meat consumption
The results of MANOVAs revealed that vegetable con-
sumption from plates was significantly higher during the
intervention period (M = 115.5, SE = 1.82) than during the
control period (M = 61.7, SE = 1.65 F(1, 993) = 478.92,
p < .001) (Table 3). The difference equaled an increase
in vegetable consumption of approximately 87%. Similarly,
total vegetable consumption (including side dishes)
was significantly higher during the intervention period
(M = 178.0, SE = 2.92) than during the control period
(M = 137.0; SE = 2.65 F(1, 993) = 108.2, p < .001). Note that
the total increase in vegetable consumption (30%) was less
than the increase in vegetable consumption from the
plates because the participants ate fewer vegetables from
the served side dishes in the intervention period. Further-
more, meat consumption was significantly lower during
the intervention period (M = 183.1, SE = 2.52) than during
the control period (M = 211.1; SE = 2.29 F(1, 993) = 67.75,
p < .001). This difference equaled a decrease of approxi-
mately 13%, which corresponds with the fact that the
amount of meat served in the intervention period was on
average 12.5% lower. These results support the hypothesis
that increasing the portion size of vegetables leads to a
higher consumption of these products and that decreasing
the portion size of meat will lead to a lower consumption
of meat products.
The results also showed significant interaction effects
between the intervention and the location of the restau-
rants on vegetable consumption from plates (F(2, 993) =
7.55, p < .01) and on meat consumption F(2, 993) = 9.31,
p < .001). Inspection of the means indicated that the dif-
ferences in vegetable consumption from plates between
the intervention and control conditions were signifi-
cantly larger in location 1 than location 2. Similarly, we
found that the differences in meat consumption between
the intervention and control conditions were signifi-
cantly larger in location 1 than in location 3.
Evaluation and satisfaction
The results of MANOVAs revealed that the participants
evaluated the amount of vegetables to be significantly
higher in the intervention period (M = .32, SE = .04) than
in the control period (M = −.12; SE = .03 F(1, 1000) = 73.30,
p < .01) (Table 4). However, the evaluation of both condi-
tions was slightly above or below the midpoint of the scale
(not too much, not too little), indicating that the amount
of vegetables was still acceptable to the participants. In
addition, participants evaluated the amount of meat to be
significantly lower in the intervention condition (M = .08;
SE = .03) than in the control condition (M = .18; SE = .03
F(1, 1000) = 6.26, p < .05). Again, these scores indicated
that for both conditions, the amount of meat was still ac-
ceptable (not too much, not too little).
Satisfaction with the main dish was significantly lower
during the intervention period (M = 1.25, SE = 0.03) than
during the control period (M = 1.38; SE = 0.03 F(1, 1000) =
7.20, p < .01). However, during the intervention condition,
satisfaction with the main dish was above the mid-
point of the answer scale (0), indicating that the par-
ticipants were still (very) satisfied with their meal.
Furthermore, satisfaction with the restaurant visit did
not differ between the intervention period (M = 1.27,
SE = .31) and the control period (M = 1.35; SE = .03
F(1, 1000) = 3.65, p > .05). In both conditions, these
scores indicated that the participants were (very) sat-
isfied with the restaurant. Taken together, partial sup-
port was found for the hypothesis that increasing the
portion size of vegetables and decreasing the portion
size of meat would not lead to a decrease in cus-
tomer satisfaction.

 Sub-sample analyses
We further explored whether the amount of vegetables
and meat consumed differed for different subsamples
(Tables 5 and 6). Significantly gender differences were
found in the proportion of meat consumed in the con-
trol period: men (M = 211.0 g, SD = 46.77) consumed
more meat than women (M = 199.8 g, SD = 47.61; t(1,
527) = 2.71, p < .01). In addition, during the intervention
period, we found that participants with children ate sig-
nificantly more vegetables from their plates (M = 115.7
g, SD = 40.97) and overall (M = 177.2 g, SD = 59.09) than
participants who had no children (M = 106.7 g, SD =
44.99; t(1, 459) = 2.09, p < .05 and M = 161.2 g, SD =
59.12; t(1, 459) = 2.66, p < .01, respectively). Additionally,

 positive correlations between age and the amount of
vegetables consumed were found in both the control
period and the intervention period (p < .01), implying
that older people ate more vegetables.
Furthermore, in the intervention period, participants
who visited the restaurant for business consumed a sig-
nificantly higher total amount of vegetables (M = 210.4
g, SD = 43.99) than participants who visited the restaur-
ant for leisure (M = 171.2 g, SD = 59.35; t(1, 467) = 2.54,

visits and vegetable consumption from plates in the
control period (p < .05). These correlations implied
that participants who visited the restaurant more fre-
quently tended to eat less vegetables.
Finally, strong positive correlations were found be-
tween the reported importance of eating vegetables
when dining out and the amount of vegetables con-
sumed from plates as well as total vegetable consump-

 (p < .05); and between willingness to eat more vegetables
and total vegetable consumption during the control
period (p < .001).2 Therefore, consumers who already
had a positive attitude towards vegetables were more
likely to ate more vegetables. In addition, knowledge of
the amount of vegetables one has to eat during the day
was positively correlated with the amount of vegetables
consumed from plates and total vegetable consumption
in the intervention period (p < .05); in contrast, difficulty
assessing whether one has eaten enough vegetables was
negatively correlated with the total amount of vegetables
consumed for the intervention period (p < .05). Finally,
fastidiousness with regard to vegetables was somewhat
strikingly negatively correlated with meat consumption
during the control period as well as the intervention
period (p < .05).
Discussion
Discussion of main results
The aim of this research was to investigate whether in-
creased portion sizes of vegetables and decreased por-
tion sizes of meat in main dishes increased the amount
of vegetables consumed in a real-life restaurant setting
without affecting customer’s satisfaction. The results of
this real-life experiment showed that during the inter-
vention period, participants consumed 87% more vegeta-
bles from their plates compared to the control period.
Taking into account that fewer vegetables were eaten
from side dishes during the intervention period, partici-
pants still consumed 30% more vegetables in total (from
the plates and the side dishes) during the intervention
period than during the control period. These findings
are in line with Rolls et al., who found that increasing
the portion size of healthy food products with a low en-
ergy density led to a higher consumption of these
healthy food products [26].
Although participants evaluated the amount of vegeta-
bles to be higher and the amount of meat lower in the
intervention period compared to the control period, they
remained (very) satisfied with their main dish. Satisfac-
tion with the main dish was only slightly lower during
the intervention period than during the control period.
In addition, satisfaction with the visit to the restaurant
did not differ, and no complaints were received during
the intervention period. These results suggest that por-
tion size could significantly affect how much food is
consumed while largely not affecting satisfaction. These
findings seem to be consistent with another field study
by Diliberti et al., in which no differences in satisfaction
between restaurant meals with a higher and lower por-
tion size were found [18].
Discussion of other results
The results of the current study showed a significant
interaction between the intervention and the location of
the restaurants. This meant that the location of the res-
taurant was an important moderator of the results and
that the intervention seemed to work better in some res-
taurants than others. More specifically, the intervention
effect seemed to be largest in location 1 compared to

 locations 2 and 3. In additional analyses, we investigated
whether we could identify explanatory factors for this
difference in the demographic, lifestyle and nutrition-
related characteristics included in this study. We did not
find differences in gender, age or education per location
nor in any of the lifestyle characteristics. There were two
significant differences in the nutrition-related character-
istics. Visitors at location 1 reported visiting restaurants
more often than visitors at locations 2 and 3. Further-
more, visitors at location 1 (regardless of intervention or
control condition) perceived the amount of vegetables
served to be lower than the perceived amount by visitors
at locations 2 and 3. We can only speculate regarding
the reasons for these differences. It could be that there
was a difference in accuracy with regard to the measure-
ments or servings of the plates and that the portions
were smaller or larger in practice than we intended.
The importance of eating vegetables when dining out
was different during the intervention and control period.
This finding was surprising because we did not expect to
observe any significant differences between the control
and intervention period for this measure. However, be-
cause the study was conducted in a real-life setting, it
was not possible to completely randomize participants
between an intervention and control group. Moreover,
other variables that were not measured that were beyond
control of the experiment (e.g., the weather, temperature
in the restaurant, information campaigns about eating
vegetables) could have affected the importance of eating
vegetables during the intervention and control period.
Finally, it is also possible that the intervention itself (i.e.,
the amount of vegetables served) influenced the import-
ance of vegetable intake. For example, serving a larger
portion could be related to a lower importance of eating
vegetables and vice versa. Future research should help
clarify whether this was indeed the case.
Theoretical and practical implications
This study has several strengths that improve our under-
standing of what role restaurants could play in offering
healthier food choices (i.e., more vegetables, less meat).
First, we showed that the effects of increased portion
sizes on consumption behavior identified in previous
studies remained true for increased portion sizes of
healthy food. Second, we conducted a field experiment
in a real-life restaurant setting. To the best of our know-
ledge, this is one of the first studies to show that modify-
ing portion sizes in a restaurant setting could lead to an
increase in consumption of healthy foods. Most studies
have been conducted in a lab setting. This is an espe-
cially interesting finding given that unhealthy products
are generally preferred when hedonic goals are salient
(which is the case in restaurants) [27]. Unknowingly in-
creasing the portions of vegetables on plates could thus
circumvent these hedonic goals. Finally, we used differ-
ent data sources to confirm the robustness of the results:
observational data on vegetable consumption and self-
reported data on customer satisfaction and experiences.
By complementing self-reported measures with more
objective measures, we were more able to control for the
fact that consumers have difficulty assessing their own
consumption behavior. In addition, by measuring net
plate weights, we provided a novel method of measuring
dietary intake and dietary behavior.
From a practical perspective, the results of this study
imply that modifications of portion sizes in restaurants
are an effective tool for stimulating vegetable consump-
tion and lowering meat consumption. By using this tool,
restaurants could play an important role in mitigating
the increase in overweight and obesity and could im-
prove diet quality by offering healthier and more sus-
tainable menus. Moreover, serving more vegetables and
less meat in restaurants will contribute to having a lower
environmental impact, as the production and processing
of vegetables requires less water and has less CO2 emis-
sions than the production of meat. A Dutch research re-
port from 2013 showed that changing the composition
of plates in restaurants by decreasing the portion size of
meat and fish by 10% and increasing the vegetable por-
tion size by 22.1% lowered the ecological footprint by
5.4%, the carbon footprint (CO2) by 6.4% and the water
footprint by 6.3% [28].
Limitations and future research
This study has several limitations that could be addressed
in future research. First, we did not measure the con-
sumption of appetizers and desserts in our study, since
these courses were not weighed. The consumption of
main dishes could have been affected by other courses
that the participants consumed. In addition, substitution
effects or other side effects might have occurred. In this
study, people ate more vegetables and less meat, but they
could have increased their consumption of unhealthy
foods in their dessert orders. As the current study did not
measure the consumption of other courses, we could not
establish to what extent these effects occurred. It would
be interesting for future research to examine whether con-
cepts such as ego depletion (i.e., depleted willpower by a
task that requires a lot of self-control) play a role in side
effects that occur as a result of modifying vegetable por-
tion sizes in restaurants [29].
Similarly, we did not measure beverage consumption,
which could have affected the amount of food that the
participants ate. In this respect, previous studies found
that alcohol consumed before or with meals tended to in-
crease appetite and food intake [30, 31]. In addition, the
consumption of alcoholic beverages could lead to a greater
need for salty and fatty foods [31]. Future research should
Reinders et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity  (2017) 14:41 
Page 9 of 11
 account for all the different courses and drinks consumed
to obtain a more complete picture of the conditions under
which portion size modifications have the greatest impact.
Finally, in our study, we did not measure every com-
ponent of the main dishes and side dishes before they
were served. Instead, for feasibility reasons, the averages
of each component were calculated each evening and
were used as the average serving portion for that specific
main dish or side dish for that specific evening. Future
research could improve the accuracy of these measures
by weighing all individual dishes before consumption.
Conclusions
In conclusion, this is one of the first studies to investigate
the effects of modifying the portion sizes of vegetables
and meat included in a main dish in a real-life restaurant
setting. We found that increased portion sizes of vegeta-
bles in combination with decreased portion sizes of meat
increased vegetable consumption while simultaneously
enabling guests to remain (very) satisfied with their res-
taurant visit. These findings provide support for the idea
that modifications of portion sizes are an effective tool for
enhancing healthy and sustainable diets in restaurants.
Endnotes
1For readability, we only discuss decreased portion
sizes of meat throughout the article, but some fish
menus were also included in the study.
2Notice that we conducted a factor analysis to check
whether one or more composite measures could be ex-
tracted based on these items. The results of the factor
analysis showed no interrelationships among items that
warranted extracting a sensible number of factors.
Therefore, we decided to treat these items separately.
