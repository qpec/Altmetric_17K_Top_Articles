Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a cytokine required for effector T cell expansion, survival, and
function, especially for engineered T cells in adoptive cell immunotherapy, but its
pleiotropy leads to simultaneous stimulation and suppression of immune responses as well
as systemic toxicity, limiting its therapeutic use. We engineered IL-2 cytokine-receptor
orthogonal (ortho) pairs that interact with one another, transmitting native IL-2 signals, but
do not interact with their natural cytokine and receptor counterparts. Introduction of
orthoIL-2Rb into T cells enabled the selective cellular targeting of orthoIL-2 to engineered
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in vitro and in vivo, with limited off-target effects and negligible
toxicity. OrthoIL-2 pairs were efficacious in a preclinical mouse cancer model of adoptive
cell therapy and may therefore represent a synthetic approach to achieving selective
potentiation of engineered cells.
A
doptive transfer of tumor-reactive T cells
has evolved into a clinically useful therapy
capable of inducing antitumor immunity
in patients (1, 2). However, the broad ap-
plication of adoptive T cell transfer (ACT)
therapies to treat cancer has several limitations,
including the production of sufficient quantities
of cells for infusion and the failure of transferred
T cells to persist and remain functional in vivo.
In the clinic, the concomitant administration of
the T cell growth factor interleukin-2 (IL-2) im-
proves the survival, function, and antitumor ac-
tivity of transplanted T cells (3, 4). However, the
use of IL-2 to potentiate ACT is complicated by
the pleiotropic nature of IL-2, which induces both
immune stimulatory and suppressive T cell re-
sponses as well as potentially severe toxicities (5).
This is governed by the interaction between IL-2
and the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R), which consists of
a, b, and g subunits (6). IL-2Rb and the common
g-chain (IL-2Rg) together form the signaling dimer
and bind IL-2 with moderate affinity, whereas
IL-2Ra (CD25) does not signal but increases the
affinity of IL-2 for the binary (bg) IL-2 receptor
to sensitize T cells to low concentrations of IL-2.
The activity of IL-2 as an adjuvant to ACT is
dependent on the balance between activation of
transplanted and endogenous T cell subsets bear-
ing natural IL-2 receptors, as wellas hostresponses
that cause dose-limiting toxicities. Strategies to
overcome these limitations could improve T cell
immunotherapy (7, 8). Recognizing the need for
new approaches that afford precise targeting of
IL-2–dependent functions to a specific cell type
of interest, we devised a strategy to redirect the
specificity of IL-2 toward adoptively transferred
T cells. This method, based on receptor-ligand
orthogonalization, uses a mutant IL-2 cytokine
and mutant IL-2 receptor that bind specifically
to one another but not to their wild-type counter-
parts (Fig. 1A).
We focused on the murine IL-2/IL-2Rb inter-
action to enable in vivo characterization in syn-
geneic mouse models. The IL-2Rb chain was
chosen as the mutant receptor because the b
chain is required for signal transduction and
can bind IL-2 independently. We devised a two-
step approach to engineer orthogonal IL-2/IL-
2Rb pairs informed by the crystal structure of the
IL-2 high-affinity receptor complex (6) (Fig. 1B).
First, point mutations of the IL-2Rb chain were
identified from inspection of the interface be-
tween IL-2 and IL-2Rb that abrogated binding
to wild-type IL-2 (Fig. 1, C to E). The IL-2Rb hot-
spot residues His134 and Tyr135 make numerous
contacts with IL-2 that contribute a majority of
the binding free energy between IL-2 and IL-2Rb
(6) (Fig. 1E). A double mutant IL-2Rb [His134 →
Asp (H134D) and Tyr135 → Phe (Y135F)], referred
to herein as orthoIL-2Rb, lacked detectable bind-
ing to IL-2 (Fig. 1D), even in the presence of CD25
(fig. S1) (7, 9).
Next, we used yeast display-based evolution to
mutate, and thus remodel, the wild-type IL-2
interface region that was opposing (or facing
the site of) the IL-2Rb mutations in the crystal
structure, in order to create a molecule that bound
to orthoIL-2Rb but not to wild-type IL-2Rb. IL-2
residues in proximity to the orthoIL-2Rb binding
interface were randomly mutated and were chosen
on the basis of a homology model of the mouse
IL-2/IL-2Rb complex (Fig. 1E) derived from the
crystal structure of the human IL-2 receptor com-
plex (6). A library of ~108 unique IL-2 mutants
was displayed on the surface of yeast (fig. S2) and
subjected to multiple rounds of both positive
(against orthoIL-2Rb) and negative (against IL-
2Rb) selection (figs. S2 and S3). This collection of
yeast-displayed IL-2 mutants bound the orthoIL-
2Rb, but not wild-type IL-2Rb, and retained CD25
binding (Fig. 1D). Sequencing of yeast clones from
the evolved IL-2 libraries revealed a consensus
set of mutations at IL-2 positions in close struc-
tural proximity to the orthoIL-2Rb mutations
(fig. S4). Interestingly, a Gln30 → Asn (Q30N) mu-
tation was highly conserved across three inde-
pendent mutant IL-2 yeast libraries, whereas
all other IL-2 positions used a restricted but not
specific mutational signature. We found that
IL-2 mutations Q30N, Met33 → Val (M33V), and
Asp34 → Leu or Met (D34L/M) appear to form a
small nonpolar pocket to compensate for the
IL-2Rb Y135F mutation, whereas Gln36 → Thr,
Ser, Lys, or Glu (Q36T/S/K/E) and Glu37 → Tyr or
His (E37Y/H) mutations present a polar or charged
surface to compensate for the IL-2Rb H134D mu-
tation (Fig. 1F).
Because of the affinity-enhancing effects of
CD25 expression on the interaction of IL-2 with
the binary (bg) IL-2 receptor (10), IL-2 mutants
with negligible binding to IL-2Rb alone may still
form a functional signaling complex on cells that
also express CD25 (8). Therefore, we used a yeast-
based functional screen to further triage IL-2 mu-
tants that bound specifically to the orthoIL-2Rb
and signaled selectively on T cells that express the
orthoIL-2Rb (Fig. 1G and fig. S5), and produced
recombinantformsofselectIL-2mutants(orthoIL-2)
for characterization (figs. S6 to S8).
We focused our efforts on two orthoIL-2 mu-
tants, 1G12 and 3A10. OrthoIL-2 1G12 and 3A10
share the consensus Q30N, M33V, and D34L
mutations but differ at positions Glu29, Gln36,
Glu37, and Arg41 (Fig. 1I). OrthoIL-2 1G12 and
3A10 bound the orthoIL-2Rb with an affinity
comparable to that of the wild-type IL-2/IL-2Rb
interaction and displayed little to no detectable
binding to wild-type IL-2Rb (Fig. 1H and figs. S7
and S8) but differed in their ability to activate
IL-2Rb signaling in CD25-positive wild-type

 and orthoIL-2Rb T cells. Stimulation of orthoIL-
2Rb T cells (fig. S5B) with orthoIL-2 1G12 resulted
in dose-dependent phosphorylation of STAT5
(pSTAT5), a hallmark of IL-2R signaling, with
potency similar to that of wild-type IL-2, but also
induced pSTAT5 on wild-type T cells, albeit with
significantly reduced potency relative to IL-2
(Fig. 1, G and I, and fig. S6). By comparison,
orthoIL-2 3A10 was specific for orthoIL-2Rb
T cells, but with a weaker potency relative to IL-2
(Fig. 1, G and I, and fig. S6). We speculated that
orthoIL-2 1G12 activity on wild-type T cells is a
consequence of weak residual binding to wild-
type IL-2Rb (fig. S7). Low-affinity interactions
with IL-2Rb alone are enhanced in the presence
of CD25 (8). Indeed, orthoIL-2 1G12 exhibited
binding to wild-type IL-2Rb when first captured
by CD25, with limited binding in the absence of
CD25 (figs. S1 and S8). OrthoIL-2 3A10 did not
bind appreciably to IL-2Rb even in the presence
of CD25, in agreement with its negligible bio-
logical activity on CD25-positive T cells. Interac-
tion of orthoIL-2 1G12 and 3A10 with orthoIL-2Rb
wassignificantlyenhancedin thepresenceof CD25,
with apparent binding affinities of the ternary
CD25/orthoIL-2Rb/orthoIL-2 complex that cor-
relate with their respective potency on orthoIL-
2Rb T cells (fig. S1).
In clinical ACT regimens, patient-derived T cells
for ACT are expanded in IL-2 before re-infusion in
order to obtain sufficient numbers of therapeutic
cells with the desired genotype/phenotype (2). We
explored the in vitro activity of orthoIL-2 on ac-
tivated primary mouse CD8+ T cells engineered
to express the orthoIL-2Rb and a yellow fluores-
cent protein (YFP) to distinguish modified (YFP+)
and unmodified (YFP–) cells (Fig. 2A). The tran-
scription factor STAT5 is phosphorylated upon
IL-2 engagement with the IL-2R and translocates
to the nucleus, where it promotes the prolifera-
tion and cell cycle progression of T cells (11). Wild-
type IL-2 induced the phosphorylation of STAT5
(pSTAT5) in both wild-type and orthoIL-2Rb CD8+
T cells with similar potency and signaling am-
plitude, indicating functional signal transduc-
tion through the wild-type receptor but not
orthoIL-2Rb (Fig. 2B). By comparison, orthoIL-2
1G12 potently activated STAT5 on orthoIL-2Rb–
transduced T cells, with a potency increase by a
factor of ~5 relative to wild-type T cells. OrthoIL-2
3A10 induced somewhat weaker, albeit selective
pSTAT5 on orthoIL-2Rb–expressing but not wild-
type T cells (Fig. 2, B, D, and E). These results were
consistent with the biased binding of the orthoIL-
2s to the orthoIL-2Rb, which translated into the
selective or specific expansion of orthoIL-2Rb
T cells cultured ex vivo in orthoIL-2 1G12 or 3A10,
respectively (Fig. 2, C and D). The orthoIL-2Rb–
transduced T cells cultured in saturating concen-
trations of orthoIL-2 3A10 became enriched to
near homogeneity after 3 to 5 days (Fig. 2F).
IL-2 is indispensable for the development and
function of regulatory T cells (Tregs) (12), which
are sensitive to IL-2 as a result of constitutive
expressionof CD25 and require IL-2Rb–dependent
activation of STAT5 signaling for survival and
function (13). Both orthoIL-2 1G12 and 3A10 re-
tained specificity for Tregs modified to express the
orthoIL-2Rb, with potency similar to that on CD8+
T cells (Fig. 2G and fig. S9, A and B). In addition
to cells that naturally respond to IL-2, activation
of orthoIL-2Rb signaling pathways with orthoIL-2
could, in principle, be achieved in any cell type
that also expresses the IL-2Rg. Activated mouse
B cells expressed the IL-2Rg but lacked appre-
ciable levels of IL-2Rb (14, 15) and were relatively
insensitive to IL-2–dependent STAT5 activation

 (Fig. 2H and fig. S9, E and F). Transduction of
the orthoIL-Rb into activated B cells rendered
them responsive to orthoIL-2 (Fig. 2H and fig. S9,
E and F), but with reduced potency and increased
specificity relative to T cells. Specificity was due
to the lack of appreciable wild-type IL-2Rb on
B cells (fig. S9E).
In a host with an intact immune system, adop-
tively transferred T cells must compete with host
cells for survival signals such as IL-2 (16). How-
ever,unlikewild-typeIL-2, thereshouldbeminimal
competition from endogenous cells for orthoIL-2
consumption. Thus, we determined the in vivo
activity of orthoIL-2 and orthoIL-2Rb T cells in
mice with intact immune systems. A mixture of
wild-type and orthoIL-2Rb CD8+ T cells was adop-
tively transferred into wild-type mice, and the
impact of IL-2 and orthoIL-2 administration
on transplanted T cells and the host immune
system was quantified (Fig. 3A). OrthoIL-2 1G12
significantly expanded CD8+ T cells transduced
with the orthoIL-2Rb at doses equivalent to or
lower than wild-type IL-2, which acted through
the endogenous IL-2Rb expressed in both wild-
type and orthoIL-2Rb T cells (Fig. 3B and fig. S10).
The selectivity of orthoIL-2 1G12 for orthoIL-2Rb
T cells was dose-dependent, with increased activ-
ity on wild-type cells at increased dose amounts
and/or frequency of treatment (Fig. 3, B and C,
and figs. S10 to S12). These results were consistent
with the in vitro selectivity of orthoIL-2 1G12,
although it remained possible that orthoIL-2 1G12
signaling through the orthoIL-2Rb could trigger
endogenous IL-2 production by the orthoIL-2Rb
T cells, leading to indirect signaling through the
wild-type IL-2R in cis or trans.
At high doses and twice-daily administration,
orthoIL-2 3A10 resulted in the substantial expan-
sion of orthoIL-2Rb T cells with high specificity
and no wild-type T cell expansion (Fig. 3, B and C,
and figs. S11 and S12). This finding suggests that
the effects of high-dose orthoIL-2 1G12 treatment
were due not to induction of endogenous IL-2
by orthoIL-2Rb CD8+ T cells, but rather to low-
level cross-reactivity with the wild-type IL-2Rb
by this molecule. The orthoIL-2 variants also pro-
moted the in vivo expansion of orthoIL-2Rb CD4+
effector T cell (Teff) (Fig. 3I and fig. S12) and
orthoIL-2Rb CD4+ Treg (fig. S9, C and D) cell sub-
sets with specificity similar to that in CD8+ T cells.
The two different orthoIL-2 variants exhibited
specificities in vivo that mirrored their relative
specificities in vitro. Despite its ability to activate
wild-type IL-2Rb signaling, albeit with about one
order of magnitude less potency than orthoIL-2Rb
signaling, orthoIL-2 1G12 administration was rela-
tively specific for orthoIL-2Rb T cells in vivo (Fig. 3,
B to H, and figs. S10 to S12). In mice treated twice
daily with orthoIL-2 1G12 only, CD4+ Tregs were
elevated to a substantially lower degree than
observed in IL-2–treated mice (Fig. 3F). How-
ever, the orthoIL-2 3A10 variant, consistent with
the lack of wild-type IL-2Rb signaling, had no
detectable activity on host cell subset numbers
(fig. S11) or expression of CD25, PD-1, and TIM-3,
which are up-regulated by early or late IL-2R
signaling (fig. S13).
To improve in vivo half-life and enable more
convenient dosing, we fused IL-2 and orthoIL-2
to mouse serum albumin (17) (MSA), which has
been shown to extend the half-life of mouse IL-2
from 5 hours to 50 hours (18). Fusion to MSA had
littleto no impact onIL-2–or orthoIL-2–dependent
T cell proliferation in vitro (fig. S14); however, the
in vivo activity was greatly enhanced. Fusion of

 orthoIL-2 1G12 to MSA substantially increased
its activity on cells that express the wild-type
IL-2R relative to native orthoIL-2 1G12, leading
to increased off-target effects and toxicity (fig.
S15). However, the MSA–orthoIL-2 3A10 fusion
protein retained exquisite specificity for orthoIL-
2Rb T cells (fig. S16).
One of the major limitations of IL-2 in the
clinic is that IL-2 toxicity limits the use of high-
dose IL-2 therapy for metastatic cancer and as an
adjuvant to adoptive T cell therapy (12). IL-2
administered as a MSA fusion resulted in a num-
ber of dose-dependent and dose-accumulating
toxicities that led to weight loss, restricted mobil-
ity, hypothermia, ruffled fur, hunched posture,
splenomegaly, lymphomegaly, and death (Fig. 3,
J to L, and figs. S15 to S18). In contrast, MSA–
orthoIL-2 3A10 was nontoxic at all doses evaluated.
MSA–orthoIL-2 3A10 activity was negligible on all
IL-2–responsive host cell subsets evaluated.
In addition to its role as a proliferative cyto-
kine, IL-2 is a potent effector cytokine capable of
activating cytotoxic T cell functions and T cell in-
flammatory pathways (19). We determined the
capacity of adoptively transferred orthoIL-2Rb
CD8+ T cells to produce interferon-g (IFN-g)
and cell surface levels of the immune inhibitory
receptors PD-1 and TIM-3 after expansion in vivo
with orthoIL-2. TIM-3 expression correlates with
a highly dysfunctional CD8+ T cell state, whereas
PD-1 expression is associated with both T cell ac-
tivation and exhaustion (20). OrthoIL-2Rb T cells
expanded in orthoIL-2 produced significantly more

Downloaded from 
 IFN-g than IL-2–expanded cells (Fig. 4A). PD-1 levels
were similar on orthoIL-2Rb T cells from both IL-2–
and orthoIL-2–treated mice (Fig. 4B). Interestingly,
TIM-3 levels were significantly lower on orthoIL-
2Rb T cells from mice treated with orthoIL-2 rela-
tive to those treated with IL-2 (Fig. 4B).
The differential activity of orthoIL-2 on both
T cell expansion and function may be due to in-
creased bioavailability of orthoIL-2 for orthoIL-2Rb
T cells as the result of a reduced antigen sink or
alternative host factors influenced by IL-2 but not
orthoIL-2, which in turn may influence the func-
tion of transplanted T cells. For instance, IL-2 but
not orthoIL-2 treatment increased host CD4+ and
CD8+ T cell IFN-g production upon ex vivo restim-
ulation (Fig. 3, M to O) and increased the serum
concentration of numerous inflammatory cyto-
kines, including IFN-g, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-13
(Fig. 3, P and Q, and fig. S17). The ability to decou-
ple direct IL-2 activity on transplanted T cells from
indirect host bystander effects using orthoIL-2/
IL-2R pairs may have important therapeutic
implications.
To investigate prospective clinical applications
of orthogonal IL-2/IL-2R pairs, we determined
the efficacy of tumor-specific orthoIL-2Rb T cells
in the B16-F10 mouse model of melanoma. Trans-
genic pmel-1 T cell receptor (TCR) cells (pmel-1
T cells) express a high-affinity TCR that recognizes
the B16-F10 specific ortholog of human gp100 (19),
a self antigen overexpressed in human melanoma
(Fig. 4, C and D). Adoptive transfer of pmel-1 T cells
in combination with lymphocyte depletion and
IL-2 administration can model ACT approaches
to treat human cancer. Adoptive transfer of pmel-1
T cells accompanied by five daily injections of IL-2
significantly delayed tumor growth in mice and
increased survival relative to mice treated only
with T cells and saline (Fig. 4, E to G). Transfer
of orthoIL-2Rb pmel-1 T cells followed by treat-
ment with native orthoIL-2 1G12 at a dose that
had minimal activity on wild-type IL-2R cells
(fig. S10) produced a significant tumor growth
delay and survival advantage that mirrored the
IL-2 treatment group (Fig. 4, E and F). Similar
antitumorresponseswere observedinmice treated
with orthoIL-2Rb pmel-1 T cells and MSA–orthoIL-2
3A10 (Fig. 4, G and H). There was no therapeutic
benefit of orthoIL-2 in mice that received wild-
type pmel-1 T cells, indicating that orthoIL-2
activity is dependent on expression of the orthoIL-
2Rb in pmel-1 T cells.
Our results constitute an approach to redirect
the specificity of IL-2 toward engineered T cells
using orthogonal IL-2 cytokine-receptor pairs,
which enables the selective expansion of de-
sired T cell subsets in settings of adoptive cell
therapy, but with limited off-target activity and
negligible toxicity. Engineering orthogonal mo-
lecular recognition at a protein–small molecule
or protein-protein interface has resulted in
synthetic enzymes, kinases, transcription fac-
tors, and receptors with controllable biological
functions, but here we apply this concept to
protein interactions with cell surface receptors
to control signaling specificity and downstream
cellular functions (21–28). Orthogonal IL-2/IL-
2R pairs may be useful not only as a research
tool but in the clinic to specifically enrich trans-
duced T cells that express a target gene of inter-
est, such as a CAR or engineered TCR, when
coupled with expression of the orthoIL-2Rb. Our
approach, and variations of this orthogonaliza-
tion strategy, may be applicable to other cytokines,
growth factors, hormones, and ligand-receptor
interactions to decipher and manipulate other-
wise complex biological systems.
