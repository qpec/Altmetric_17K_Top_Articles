IMPORTANCE Non–vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are commonly prescribed with
other medications that share metabolic pathways that may increase major bleeding risk.
OBJECTIVE To assess the association between use of NOACs with and without concurrent
medications and risk of major bleeding in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study using data from the Taiwan
National Health Insurance database and including 91 330 patients with nonvalvular atrial
fibrillation who received at least 1 NOAC prescription of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban
from January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2016, with final follow-up on December 31, 2016.
EXPOSURES NOAC with or without concurrent use of atorvastatin; digoxin; verapamil;
diltiazem; amiodarone; fluconazole; ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, or posaconazole;
cyclosporine; erythromycin or clarithromycin; dronedarone; rifampin; or phenytoin.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Major bleeding, defined as hospitalization or emergency
department visit with a primary diagnosis of intracranial hemorrhage or gastrointestinal,
urogenital, or other bleeding. Adjusted incidence rate differences between person-quarters
(exposure time for each person during each quarter of the calendar year) of NOAC with or
without concurrent medications were estimated using Poisson regression and inverse
probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score.
RESULTS Among 91 330 patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (mean age, 74.7 years [SD,
10.8]; men, 55.8%; NOAC exposure: dabigatran, 45 347 patients; rivaroxaban, 54 006 patients;
and apixaban, 12 886 patients), 4770 major bleeding events occurred during 447 037
person-quarters with NOAC prescriptions. The most common medications co-prescribed with
NOACs over all person-quarters were atorvastatin (27.6%), diltiazem (22.7%), digoxin (22.5%),
and amiodarone (21.1%). Concurrent use of amiodarone, fluconazole, rifampin, and phenytoin
with NOACs had a significant increase in adjusted incidence rates per 1000 person-years of
major bleeding than NOACs alone: 38.09 for NOAC use alone vs 52.04 for amiodarone
(difference, 13.94 [99% CI, 9.76-18.13]); 102.77 for NOAC use alone vs 241.92 for fluconazole
(difference, 138.46 [99% CI, 80.96-195.97]); 65.66 for NOAC use alone vs 103.14 for rifampin
(difference, 36.90 [99% CI, 1.59-72.22); and 56.07 for NOAC use alone vs 108.52 for phenytoin
(difference, 52.31 [99% CI, 32.18-72.44]; P < .01 for all comparisons). Compared with NOAC use
alone, the adjusted incidence rate for major bleeding was significantly lower for concurrent use
of atorvastatin, digoxin, and erythromycin or clarithromycin and was not significantly different
for concurrent use of verapamil; diltiazem; cyclosporine; ketoconazole, itraconazole,
voriconazole, or posaconazole; and dronedarone.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients taking NOACs for nonvalvular atrial
fibrillation, concurrent use of amiodarone, fluconazole, rifampin, and phenytoin compared
with the use of NOACs alone, was associated with increased risk of major bleeding. Physicians
prescribing NOAC medications should consider the potential risks associated with
concomitant use of other drugs.

 A
trial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia with an
increasing prevalence and an association with throm-
boembolism and related adverse outcomes.1 Oral
anticoagulation has been proven to prevent ischemic strokes
and prolong life for patients with atrial fibrillation.2 Non–
vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOAC) are being used more
frequently because of their ease of administration and com-
parative efficacy compared with warfarin in reducing throm-
boembolism and major bleeding.3,4 However, for patients
with atrial fibrillation, NOACs still pose a major bleeding
risk,5 which is particularly problematic when multiple mor-
bidities, high-risk medications, polypharmacy, or drug-drug
interactions are present.6
Two large clinical trials among patients with atrial fibril-
lation were conducted from 2006 through 2009 and
approximately two-thirds of the participants (especially
the elderly) took more than 5 drugs concurrently with a
NOAC.7,8 Polypharmacy among NOAC users may increase
plasma levels and the risk of bleeding.7 Current knowledge
of drug-drug interactions associated with NOACs mainly
comes from animal studies, case reports, and limited phar-
macokinetic measurement.9,10 Particular attention has been
paid to medications (such as CYP3A4 inhibitors and
P-glycoprotein competitors) that share common metabolic
pathways with NOACs.11,12 For example, ketoconazole and
clarithromycin increase active NOAC levels in plasma and
risk of bleeding.10,13
However, complex comedications and comorbidities hin-
der the quantification of bleeding risk associated with NOAC
use in patients with atrial fibrillation.6,14 Combining NOACs
with other commonly used medications is generally avoided
in clinical trials because the medications may alter NOAC lev-
els in plasma and increase the risk of bleeding. To our knowl-
edge, the influence of the concurrent use of CYP3A4 inhibi-
tors or P-glycoprotein competitors on the magnitude of
bleedingriskinNOACusershasnotbeenquantifiedintheclini-
calsetting.Thisstudyusedanationwidecohortofpatientswith
nonvalvular atrial fibrillation to estimate the bleeding risk in
NOAC users associated with the concurrent use of 12 com-
monly prescribed medications that share metabolic path-
ways with NOACs.
Methods
Source of Data
This retrospective cohort study obtained ethical approval
from the institutional review board of Taiwan Chang Gung
Memorial Hospital and was conducted in full compliance
with national ethical and regulatory guidelines. The institu-
tional review board determined that patient consent was not
required because all data were anonymized by the data
holder, the Taiwan National Health Insurance Administra-
tion (NHIA). The Taiwan NHI system was established in 1995
as a single-payer insurance system co-funded by the govern-
ment, employers, and beneficiaries. All citizens and foreign-
ers living in Taiwan for more than 6 months are required
by law to enroll in NHI. At the end of 2016, approximately
23 million beneficiaries were registered in NHI, which is
equivalent to a coverage rate of 99.5%.
Novel medications, such as NOACs, are often approved
and reimbursed by NHI, especially once clinical trials began
providing evidence of efficacy and safety. Since 1995, the
NHI database has recorded comprehensive registration infor-
mation and claims data, which include patient characteris-
tics, medical diagnoses, prescription details, examinations,
operations, procedures, and fees incurred. The whole data-
base is linked by the unique national personal identification,
which was anonymized before its release for research use to
prevent confidentiality leaks. The anonymized national per-
sonal identification remains consistent across the NHI data-
base and between government-held data sets, allowing valid
internal and external linkage.15 The diagnoses and proce-
dures were recorded using the International Classification of
Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes
from 1997 through 2015 and the International Classification
of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM)
codes since 2016.
Study Population
We identified all patients (outpatients or inpatients) with 2
consecutive records of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation diagno-
sis (ICD-9-CM code 427.31 or ICD-10-CM code I48) 15 and at
least 1 NOAC prescription (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or
apixaban) from January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2016.
Patients with mitral stenosis or prosthetic valves were
excluded because NOACs were not indicated in this popula-
tion. Patients were followed up until death, deregistration,
or the end of the study (December 31, 2016).
Follow-up Time and Person-Quarters
In this study, each calendar year was partitioned into 4 quar-
ters for each patient and each year after the first prescription
of a NOAC. The analytic unit was 1 person-quarter.16 Person-
quarters were used because medications for chronic illnesses
were refilled with a maximum length of 3 months per the
Taiwan NHI reimbursement policy. Medications and covari-
ates were assessed for each person-quarter, which simplified
the assessment of the complex prescription pattern of NOACs
and multiple drugs. Person-quarters exposed to NOACs with
Key Points
Question What is the risk of major bleeding among patients with
nonvalvular atrial fibrillation treated with non–vitamin K oral
anticoagulants (NOACs) in combination with medications that
share metabolic pathways?
Findings Among 91 330 NOAC users in Taiwan, the risk of major
bleeding was significantly increased with concurrent use of
amiodarone, fluconazole, rifampin, or phenytoin compared with
NOAC use alone.
Meaning Physicians prescribing NOAC medications should
consider the potential risks associated with concomitant use of
other drugs.

 or without concurrent medications were identified. The ma-
jor bleeding risks of person-quarters exposed to NOACs and 12
concurrent medications (atorvastatin; digoxin; verapamil; dil-
tiazem; amiodarone; fluconazole; ketoconazole, itracon-
azole, voriconazole, or posaconazole; cyclosporine; erythro-
mycin or clarithromycin; dronedarone; rifampin; and
phenytoin) were compared with person-quarters exposed to
NOAC alone. These medications were selected because they
were P-glycoprotein competitors (digoxin, verapamil, dilti-
azem, amiodarone, and cyclosporine), CYP3A4 inhibitors
(fluconazole and ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, or
posaconazole), or both (atorvastatin, erythromycin or clar-
ithromycin, dronedarone, rifampin, and phenytoin), which
mayhaveapotentialdrug-druginteractionwithNOACs.11,14,17-23
Major Outcomes
The primary outcome was major bleeding, defined as a hos-
pitalization or an emergency department visit with a primary
diagnosis of intracranial hemorrhage or gastrointestinal, uro-
genital, or other bleeding, as previously described.24 People
with traumatic hemorrhage were excluded from analysis. Only
1 major bleeding event was included in each person-quarter.
Secondary outcomes included site-specific bleeding. Details
of case definitions for the primary outcome are listed in eTable
1 in the Supplement.
Covariates
Patient demographics, comorbidities, relevant medications,
and health care utilization were identified as covariates.15,25
These covariates were assessed for each person-quarter per-
tinent to the first date of the person-quarter. Patient demo-
graphics included age, sex, and socioeconomic factors (resi-
dence, income level, and occupation). The components of the
Charlson comorbidity index (range, 0-37; a score of 5 points
or more has a 1-y mortality rate of 85%26),27 other comorbidi-
ties (myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, periph-
eral vascular disease, stroke, transient ischemic attack, de-
mentia, chronic pulmonary disease, anemia, kidney diseases,
and hepatic diseases), components of HAS-BLED (hyperten-
sion, abnormal kidney or liver function, stroke, bleeding his-
tory, and alcohol use), number of outpatient visits, proton
pump inhibitors, aspirin, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, warfarin,
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids, insu-
lin, oral hypoglycemic agents, antihypertensives, and lipid-
lowering agents were also assessed. The code lists of these co-
variates are shown in eTable 1 in the Supplement.
Models
Confounding by indication, which results from nonrandom
treatment allocation for concurrent medications, was an es-
sential consideration in the comparison of major bleeding risk
among patients with NOAC use who were exposed vs unex-
posed to concurrent medications.28,29 The inverse probabil-
ity of treatment weighting using the propensity score was ap-
plied to account for this bias.30 The propensity score was the
probability that a patient was prescribed the concurrent medi-
cation during a person-quarter. For each person, a specific pro-
pensity score for a specific concurrent medication was calcu-
lated using logistic regression considering the aforementioned
covariatespertinenttothefirstdateoftheperson-quarter.Stan-
dardized differences were estimated to assess the balance of
individual covariates before and after propensity score weight-
ing. The balance of covariates was assessed using the abso-
lute standardized mean difference. The negligible difference
was defined as an absolute standardized mean difference less
than 0.1. eTables 2A–L in the Supplement summarize the bal-
ance of covariates between users and nonusers of each spe-
cific concurrent medication.
Statistical Analysis
Poisson regression with a generalized estimating equations
modeltoaccountforintra-individualcorrelationacrossperson-
quarters was used to calculate the adjusted incidence rate dif-
ference, incidence rate ratios, and 99% CIs with consider-
ation of the inverse probability of treatment weighting using
the propensity score. Person-quarters using NOAC alone were
used as the reference category. Because 12 types of combina-
tionswerestudied,theregressionanalysiswasperformedsepa-
rately for each combination. In addition, a different defini-
tion of major bleeding—a hospitalization or emergency visits
due to major bleeding recorded in the primary or secondary
diagnosis—was applied as a sensitivity analysis.
Three additional analyses were conducted to ascertain
the association of a NOAC plus concurrent medications and
major bleeding: (1) The associations of a NOAC plus specific
concurrent medications with bone fractures due to vehicle
crashes (not related to the NOAC). (2) The association of the
combination of losartan (a medication to replace NOAC in
the model) plus concurrent medications with major bleed-
ing (for details, see eTable 6C and 6D in the Supplement).
(3) The association of a NOAC plus concurrent medication
groups (ie, P-glycoprotein competitors group or CYP3A4
inhibitors group) with major bleeding.
The Bonferroni method was used to consider a type I er-
rorduetomultiplecomparisons.Threesignificancelevelswere
used for hypothesis tests: .05, .01, and .005. The results were
similar and the significance level of .01 was chosen to be re-
ported in the main text. Estimates based on the alternative sig-
nificance levels are reported in the eTables in the Supple-
ment.Missingdatawerepresentamongpatientswithoutavalid

 diabetes. There were 45 347 patients (49.7%) exposed to dabi-
gatran, 54 006 patients (59.1%) to rivaroxaban, and 12 886 pa-
tients (14.1%) to apixaban during the follow-up period.
Bleeding Events
During follow-up, 4770 major bleeding events occurred dur-
ing 447 037 person-quarters with NOAC prescriptions.
The major bleeding events included 1177 intracranial and 3341
gastrointestinalbleedingsand182eventsoccurredinothersites.
Table3summarizestheincidencerate,adjustedincidencerate,
and adjusted incidence rate difference for major bleeding
among the 12 combinations of a NOAC and concurrent medi-
cations. The most common medications co-prescribed with
NOACs over all person-quarters were atorvastatin (27.6%), dil-
tiazem (22.7%), digoxin (22.5%), and amiodarone (21.1%).
The combinations of a NOAC with amiodarone, fluconazole,
rifampin, and phenytoin were associated with an increased
risk of major bleeding. Compared with person-quarters of
NOAC use alone (reference category), the adjusted incidence
rate differences per 1000 person-years of major bleeding for
a NOAC combined with other medications were 13.94 (99% CI,
9.76-18.13) with amiodarone, 138.46 (99% CI, 80.96-195.97)
withfluconazole,36.90(99%CI,1.59-72.22)withrifampin,and
52.31 (99% CI, 32.18-72.44) with phenytoin. The other combi-
nations were not associated with any increase in bleeding risk.
Atorvastatin,digoxin,anderythromycinorclarithromycinwere
associated with a reduced adjusted incidence rate difference
of major bleeding (for data on the different significance lev-
els, see eTable 3 in the Supplement).
Secondary Analysis
Separate analyses for dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban
are summarized in Table 4. The patterns of bleeding risk
associated with concurrent medications of dabigatran, rivar-
oxaban, or apixaban users were similar to the primary
results. Concurrent medications of amiodarone, fluconazole,
and phenytoin with a NOAC were associated with a higher
major bleeding risk than NOAC use alone (for details, see
eTables 4A-C in the Supplement).
Major bleeding events were classified anatomically into
intracranial hemorrhage or bleeding in the gastrointestinal
tract or other sites (including urogenital, pleural, or perito-
neal bleeding). The adjusted incidence rate differences of
major bleeding associated with the combinations of a NOAC
and concurrent medications are listed in Table 5. The pat-
terns of bleeding risks were similar in these bleeding sites.
Sensitivity and Additional Analyses
In a sensitivity analysis using alternative case definitions for
major bleeding (hospitalization discharge or emergency vis-
its recorded in the primary or secondary diagnoses), the ad-
justed incidence rate difference per 1000 person-years of ma-
jor bleeding for a NOAC combined with other medications was
31.83 (99% CI, 26.40-37.26) with amiodarone, 265.25 (99% CI,
184.72-345.78) with fluconazole, 60.21 (99% CI, 4.79-115.63)
with rifampin, and 80.10 (99% CI, 54.93-105.26) with phe-
nytoin, showing an increase in bleeding rate ratios (for de-
tails, see eTable 6A and eTable 6B in the Supplement).
The first additional analysis was to evaluate the associa-
tions between the combination of losartan and 12 concurrent
medicationsandmajorbleeding.Noneofthecombinationswas
associated with an increased bleeding risk (for details, see
eTable 6A and eTable 6C in the Supplement).
Thesecondadditionalanalysisexaminedwhetherthecom-
bination of a NOAC and 12 concurrent medications were asso-
ciated with an unrelated adverse event, such as bone frac-
tures. None of the combination was associated with an
increased bone fracture risk (for details, see eTable 6A and
eTable 6D in the Supplement).
In the third additional analysis, 12 concurrent medica-
tions were categorized into 2 metabolic pathway groups
(P-glycoprotein competitors group (digoxin, verapamil,
diltiazem, amiodarone, and cyclosporine) and both
P-glycoprotein competitors and CYP3A4 inhibitors group
(atorvastatin; fluconazole; ketoconazole, itraconazole, vori-
conazole, or posaconazole; erythromycin or clarithromycin;
dronedarone; rifampin; and phenytoin). The combinations of
NOAC with both groups were associated with a higher bleed-
ing risk (for details, see eTable 7 in the Supplement).

 Discussion
Thisnationwidepopulation-basedcohortstudypresentsthefol-
lowing main findings. First, some specific medications ad-
vised to be avoided in NOAC users,33 including diltiazem and
amiodarone, were frequently prescribed to patients with non-
valvular atrial fibrillation in the clinical settings. Second, amio-
darone, fluconazole, rifampin, and phenytoin were associated
with a significantly increased risk of major bleeding, whereas
some combinations not recommended by guidelines were not
associated with major bleeding.

 Although the 12 concurrent medications evaluated in
this study are not recommended by the updated guide-
lines,33 they are often required for NOAC users in many clini-
cal scenarios. Digoxin, diltiazem, amiodarone, and atorva-
statin were used in more than 20% of NOAC-exposed
person-quarters. This is in line with the Apixaban for Reduc-
tion in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial
Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) and the Randomized Evaluation of
Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy (RE-LY) trials, which
reported that approximately 30% and 10% of NOAC users
were prescribed digoxin or amiodarone, respectively.34-36
On the other hand, prescription of cyclosporine and antifun-
gal azoles to NOAC users was rarely found.
There was a difference between the data from this study
andclinicaltrials.Inmosttrials,theconcurrentmedicationsta-
tus was reported as part of the baseline characteristics and per-
centage numbers of total patients enrolled. The estimates in
this study, however, were the person-quarter exposed to a
NOAC and concurrent medications, which reflected the dy-
namic and complex prescription pattern of concurrent medi-
cations in NOAC users in a more precise manner. To our knowl-
edge, the prevalence of rare combinations, such as antifungal
azoles or cyclosporine, with a NOAC has not been reported in
theliterature.Theseinfrequentcombinations,however,donot
necessarily carry a lower risk of major bleeding.
Amiodarone plus a NOAC was associated with signifi-
cantly more major bleeding events in all primary and second-
ary analyses. During observation periods, the combination of
a NOAC and amiodarone use was associated with an adjusted
incidence rate difference for major bleeding of 13.94 events per
1000 person-years, which probably exceeds any benefit that
such a combination could deliver. This is, to our knowledge,
a novel observation because (1) the combination is frequent
in clinical settings, and (2) a subanalysis of the ARISTOTLE trial
showed no difference in major bleeding between apixaban us-
ers with and without amiodarone use.36 The highest bleed-
ing risk was found in the combination of fluconazole and a
NOAC, with an adjusted incidence rate difference of 138.46
events per 1000 person-years. Therefore, fluconazole should
be avoided in NOAC users.
Paradoxically, several combinations were associated with
lower bleeding risk. Atorvastatin was reported to reduce all
stoke and not to increase intracranial hemorrhage.37-39 The
lower bleeding rate associated with atorvastatin found in this
study might be partially related to the prevention of hemor-
rhagic transformation after ischemic stroke. Statins had been

 suggested to decrease gastrointestinal bleeding rates in pa-
tients with acute coronary syndromes.40 Considering the car-
diovascular benefit of atorvastatin and a lack of increased
bleeding risk, clinicians should not avoid using atorvastatin
with a NOAC in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.
The crude bleeding rate of erythromycin or clarithromycin
combined with a NOAC was higher than NOAC use alone,
but adjusted rates were higher in the NOAC use alone group.
The most plausible explanation was that clarithromycin was
an integral part of antibiotic treatment for Helicobacter pylori
infection.41 The reduction of peptic ulcer bleeding risk by anti-
Helicobacter treatment seems to outweigh the potential bleed-
ing risk brought by an increase in plasma concentration of the
NOAC as a result of the concurrent use of macrolide. The lower
bleeding rate associated with digoxin was marginal. Consid-
ering the relatively unchanged plasma levels found in a phar-
macokinetic study of dabigatran,20 digoxin plus NOACs might
be considered a safe combination.
Many combinations were found to increase NOAC levels
inplasmainthepharmacokineticstudies,11,18-20,22butwerenot
associated with increased risk of bleeding in this cohort study.
For example, there were discrepancies between pharma-
cokinetic interaction and clinically relevant bleeding risk
observed in atorvastatin, digoxin, verapamil, cyclosporine,
or clarithromycin or erythromycin. On the other hand, shared
metabolic pathways might explain the high bleeding risk of
NOACsplusfluconazoleoramiodarone.Themostplausiblerea-
son for this discrepancy may be that higher plasma levels of
NOAC did not necessarily result in more bleeding, which was
also related to the comorbidity and the main drug benefits of
the concurrent medications. Another reason might be that the
limited pharmacokinetic data of NOAC use was mostly col-
lected from healthy volunteers who have different pharma-
cokinetic profiles from NOAC users, who tend to be older, with
more comorbidity and polypharmacy.
This is the first, to our knowledge, nationwide population-
based cohort study to quantify the major bleeding risk asso-
ciated with drug-drug interaction with NOACs. The person-
quarter model with inverse probability of treatment weighting
using the propensity score helped to overcome confounding
byindicationbiasandthecomplexprescriptionpatterninclini-
cal setting. The design focused on a short-term risk of ad-
verse events and addressed the unstable complex prescrib-
ingbehavior.Complexprescriptiondecisionmakingfortheuse
of concurrent medications (based on changes in patients’clini-
cal conditions) was considered in the model with the prob-
ability of treatment weighting using the propensity score in

 of NOACs concurrently with specific medications and a risk of
major bleeding was unlikely related to unmeasured bleeding
characteristics.
Several major potential applications could be derived from
this study. First, prompt or even real-time postmarket moni-
toring is possible. In most standard clinical trials, it is imprac-
tical to measure the risk of a specific major adverse event re-
lated to any drug combination. With the design applied in this
study, severe adverse effects of new combinations of medica-
tions might be detected earlier. Second, systemic and auto-
matic monitoring of the safety profiles of new drugs with au-
tomatic data processing is possible. It is feasible to combine
a pharmacology database that contains potential drug-drug
interactionswithaclinicaldatabaseandthemethodologyused
in this study to quantify the risk of potential adverse events.
Limitations
Thisstudyhadseverallimitations.First,becauseedoxabanwas
introduced in Taiwan after 2016, not all NOACs were studied.
Although similar interactions and patterns were found in all
other 3 NOACs, these observations may not apply to edoxa-
ban. Second, kidney and liver function data were not avail-
able in the NHI database and these factors may interfere with
drug-drug interaction, bleeding risk, and medication dosing.
However, some proxy indicators (such as erythropoietin for se-
verekidneydiseaseanddiagnosisofliverdiseases)wereadded
in the model to represent the severity of kidney or hepatic dis-
eases. Third, bleeding risk and anticoagulant treatment in the
Asian population have been recognized to be different from
the Western population.42 Therefore, the external generaliz-
ability of these results, particularly to Western population may
be limited. Fourth, dosages of NOACs and the studied medi-
cationswerenotconsideredinthemodelbecauseitwouldhave
complicated the complex model further.
Conclusions
Among patients taking NOACs for nonvalvular atrial fibrilla-
tion,concurrentuseofamiodarone,fluconazole,rifampin,and
phenytoin compared with the use of NOACs alone, was asso-
ciated with increased risk of major bleeding. Physicians pre-
scribing NOAC medications should consider the potential risks
associated with concomitant use of other drugs.
