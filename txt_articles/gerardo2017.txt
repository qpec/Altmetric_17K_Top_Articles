Study objective: Copperhead snake (Agkistrodon contortrix) envenomation causes limb injury resulting in pain and
disability. It is not known whether antivenom administration improves limb function. We determine whether
administration of antivenom improves recovery from limb injury in patients envenomated by copperhead snakes.
Methods: From August 2013 through November 2015, we performed a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, clinical trial to evaluate the effect of ovine Crotalidae polyvalent immune Fab (ovine) (CroFab; FabAV)
antivenom therapy on recovery of limb function in patients with copperhead snake envenomation at 14 days
postenvenomation. The study setting was 18 emergency departments in regions of the United States where copperhead
snakes are endemic. Consecutive patients aged 12 years or older with mild- to moderate-severity envenomation
received either FabAV or placebo. The primary outcome was limb function 14 days after envenomation, measured by the
Patient-Specific Functional Scale. Additional outcomes included the Patient-Specific Functional Scale at other points; the
Disorders of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand, Lower Extremity Functional Scale, and Patient’s Global Impression of Change
instruments; grip strength; walking speed; quality of life (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System
Physical Fucntion-10); pain; and analgesic use.
Results: Seventy-four patients received study drug (45 FabAV, 29 placebo). Mean age was 43 years (range 12 to 86
years). Fifty-three percent were men, 62% had lower extremity envenomation, and 88% had mild initial severity. The
primary outcome, the least square mean Patient-Specific Functional Scale score at 14 days postenvenomation, was 8.6
for FabAV-treated subjects and 7.4 for placebo recipients (difference 1.2; 95% confidence interval 0.1 to 2.3; P¼.04).
Additional outcome assessments generally favored FabAV. More FabAV-treated subjects experienced treatment-
emergent adverse events (56% versus 28%), but few were serious (1 in each group).
Conclusion: Treatment with FabAV reduces limb disability measured by the Patient-Specific Functional Scale 14 days
after copperhead envenomation. [Ann Emerg Med. 2017;-:1-12.]

INTRODUCTION
Background
Approximately 5,000 to 9,000 people seek emergency
care in the United States for crotaline snakebites annually,
including rattlesnake, cottonmouth, and copperhead
envenomation.1 The copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix) is
responsible for nearly half of reported bites.2 Copperhead
envenomation is generally less severe than rattlesnake
envenomation.3-5 More than 95% of copperhead victims
develop significant pain and swelling of the envenomated
limb, but systemic venom effects are uncommon and death
is rare.6-9 Current data support only a crude understanding
of the time course of recovery from limb injury with or
without antivenom therapy. Although most patients
recover enough to return to work within 2 to 4 weeks,
residual symptoms can last a year or more.6,10

TOXICOLOGY/ORIGINAL RESEARCH
 Editor’s Capsule Summary
What is already known on this topic
Copperhead envenomation is rarely life threatening
but may cause prolonged limb injury.
What question this study addressed
This multicenter randomized controlled trial
evaluated the effect of antivenom administration on
limb function in a cohort of patients with
predominantly mild copperhead envenomations.
What this study adds to our knowledge
Seventy-four patients were enrolled in the study, of
whom 45 were randomized to antivenom
administration. Antivenom improved Patient-
Specific Functional Scale score at day 14 (8.6 versus
7.4; D¼1.2; 95% confidence interval 0.1 to 2.3). All
patients recovered by 4 months regardless of
intervention. Opioid use was lower in the antivenom
group.
How this is relevant to clinical practice
Outcomes in mild to moderate copperhead
envenomation are generally good. Antivenom may
improve limb function early in the course and
minimize the need for prolonged opioid analgesia.
Given associated costs, an individualized risk-benefit
discussion should occur.
Importance
Crotalidae polyvalent immune Fab (ovine) (CroFab;
FabAV) (BTG International Inc, West Conshohocken, PA)
is the only antivenom currently Food and Drug
Administration approved and marketed for the treatment of
crotaline snake envenomation. Although FabAV is
approved for the treatment of envenomation by all North
American crotaline species, copperhead-envenomated
patients were excluded from the registry trials because it
was considered unethical to expose these patients to then-
experimental antivenom (personal communication, R. C.
Dart, Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Center,
2012).11,12 The safety of FabAV was subsequently
established, and observational studies demonstrated that
FabAV administration is associated with cessation of
progression of tissue injury in copperhead victims.8,13,14
Whether this leads to improved recovery of limb function is
unstudied, and the role of FabAV in the management of
patients with nonlife-threatening envenomation is
controversial. Although many experts recommend treating
all crotaline envenomation patients according to clinical
presentation, irrespective of species, others recommend
withholding FabAV from copperhead victims.4,5,9,15-18
These conflicting recommendations have resulted in wide
practice variation, with 0% to 90% of patients at individual
hospitals receiving antivenom.5,6,10,19-21 In 3 recent
prospective studies, the proportion of copperhead patients
receiving FabAV ranged from 14% to 75%, and in the
largest study there was poor correlation between snakebite
severity score and the decision to use antivenom
(r2¼0.06).4,22,23 A 2004 editorial called for a clinical trial
to study the efficacy of FabAV therapy for copperhead
snake envenomation, but no such research has been
performed.24
Goals of This Investigation
The purpose of this study is to determine whether
administration of antivenom improves recovery from limb
injury in patients envenomated by copperhead snakes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
We performed a multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
placebo controlled, clinical trial to evaluate the effect of
FabAV administration on limb recovery. The study was
approved by the Western Institutional Review Board and
the institutional review board at each study site. In addition
to on-site monitoring by the sponsor’s clinical research
associates, study conduct was overseen by an independent
data monitoring committee. Informed consent was
obtained from all participants.
Selection of Participants
We enrolled consecutive patients from August 2013
through November 2015 at 18 emergency departments
(EDs) in regions of the United States where copperhead
snakes are endemic. Patients were nonpregnant adults
(�18 years) or adolescents (12 to 17 years) presenting with
mild- to moderate-severity envenomation by a copperhead
snake on only one extremity (distal to the elbow or knee)
that occurred within 24 hours of enrollment. Mild
envenomation was defined by swelling crossing 0 to 1
major joints (wrist, elbow, ankle, or knee), and moderate
envenomation by swelling crossing 2 major joints.
Copperhead species was confirmed by examination of the
snake or photograph of the snake brought to the ED,
patient identification of a copperhead from an array of
snake photographs, envenomation in an area where only
copperheads are endemic, or envenomation by a captive
copperhead snake.

CroFab Antivenom Versus Placebo for Copperhead Snake Envenomation
Gerardo et al
 Patients with severe venom effect at presentation
(defined as swelling to an entire extremity [crossing the hip
or shoulder joint], coagulopathy of possible medical
importance [International Normalized Ratio >2.0,
fibrinogen level <50 mg/dL, or platelet count <50,000
cells/mL], hypotension, compartment syndrome, or more
than minimal bleeding) were excluded. The full protocol is
provided in Appendix E1, available online at http://www.
annemergmed.com.
Subjects were assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive FabAV or
placebo, using centralized computer randomization,
stratified by envenomation site (upper versus lower
extremity), severity (mild versus moderate), and age
(adolescent versus adult). All study personnel (except the
unblinded study pharmacist) and patients were unaware of
treatment assignments.
Interventions
Subjects in the FabAV group received 6 vials of FabAV
in 250 mL normal saline solution as initial treatment,
repeated once if needed to halt progression of venom
effects. They then received 2 vials of FabAV 6, 12, and 18
hours later, in accordance with current Food and Drug
Administration–approved dosing instructions. Placebo
subjects received visually identical normal saline solution.
Subjects were monitored for progression to severe venom
effect and for adverse events during and after completion of
treatment.
Patients who developed severe venom effect at any time
moved into standard-of-care rescue treatment, which could
include open-label FabAV at the discretion of the treating
physician. Patients or physicians could also request
withdrawal from the protocol treatment at any time.
Subjects were evaluated according to the original treatment
group assignment, with blinding maintained unless
required for patient safety.
Data Collection and Processing
Study personnel collected data about the signs and
symptoms of the envenomation and treatment delivered
during the initial hospitalization. Protocol-specified in-
person study assessments were performed at hospital
discharge and on days 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 after
envenomation, with procedures for telephone follow-up in
case of missed study visits. Subjects also completed follow-
up assessments by telephone on days 10, 17, and 24.
Patients who had not reached full recovery on the primary
study outcome by the 28-day visit completed monthly
telephone assessments until full recovery or 4 months,
whichever occurred first.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome, chosen a priori, was the Patient-
Specific Functional Scale score at envenomation plus 14
days.25 The scale is a patient-oriented outcome that has been
extensively validated in numerous musculoskeletal disorders,
including copperhead snake envenomation.22-35 Patients were
asked to choose 3 activities they were unable to do or were
having difficulty with because of their snake envenomation,
and at each assessment reported their ability to perform these
tasks on a scale of 0 (“unable to perform activity”) to 10 (“able
to perform activity at the same level as before injury or
problem”). The mean of these 3 values is the Patient-Specific
Functional Scale score, with a score of 10 indicating full
recovery. The Patient-Specific Functional Scale has excellent
interrater reliability and test-retest validity.27,30,34 It assesses
both upper or lower extremity conditions, thereby decreasing
the sample size required to evaluate copperhead
envenomation. The scale is closely correlated with limb-
specific tools such as the Disorders of the Arm, Shoulder, and
Hand, and the Lower Extremity Functional Scale instruments,
but is more efficient to administer.22,26-29
All additional study outcomes were chosen a priori and
serve to further inform the results of the primary outcome;
they were not intended as hypothesis testing. Additional
outcomes were comparisons of the Patient-Specific
Functional Scale at other points, time to full functional
status recovery as measured by the Patient-Specific
Functional Scale, scores on the Disorders of the Arm,
Shoulder, and Hand and Lower Extremity Functional Scale
instruments (administered to subjects with upper and lower
extremity envenomation, respectively), physical function-
related quality of life measured by the Patient-Reported
Outcomes Measurement Information System Physical
Fucntion-10 (PROMIS PF-10),36 numeric pain rating
scale,37 opioid analgesic use, and the Patient’s Global
Impression of Change–1 instrument.38 For upper extremity
envenomation subjects, grip strength was measured with a
Jamar hand dynamometer (Lafayette Instruments, Lafayette,
IN)39; lower extremity subjects completed a 7.62-m walking
speed test.40 The proportion of patients moved to rescue
therapy was also a tertiary outcome. All outcome
instruments are included in the protocol in Appendix E1,
available online at http://www.annemergmed.com.
Structured adverse event collection occurred from the
first investigational product infusion through completion of
all follow-up assessments. Blinded site investigators
characterized each event as serious or nonserious, using
standard criteria, and determined whether the adverse event
was related to study drug administration.41 Each adverse
event was characterized with Medical Dictionary for
Regulatory Activities taxonomy (version 16.1).42

 Primary Data Analysis
All statistical tests were determined a priori and applied
to the modified intent-to-treat population, composed of all
patients who received at least one dose of study medication.
The primary efficacy endpoint was analyzed by ANOVA.
Least squared mean Patient-Specific Functional Scale score
was calculated for each treatment group, using a linear
mixed-effect model that included factors for the
stratification variables: anatomic location of envenomation,
severity of snakebite, and age. Treatment effect was
computed as difference in mean Patient-Specific Functional
Scale score at day 14. The last observation carried forward
method was used to impute data for missing assessments. A
supportive analysis assessed the difference in least squared
mean Patient-Specific Functional Scale scores between
treatments, using a repeated-measures ANOVA. The full
statistical analysis plan is provided in Appendix E1,
available online at http://www.annemergmed.com.
Time to full recovery on the Patient-Specific Functional
Scale was analyzed with a Cox proportional hazards model,
including stratification variables as above. Other efficacy
endpoints were analyzed with ANOVA to compare the
least squared mean of the other outcome assessments
between the treatment groups at each measured point. The

 only departure from the statistical plan was that the original
plan called for comparing analgesic use as any/none, but
later it became clear that current opioid use was more
clinically relevant. Thus, the opioid/no-opioid comparison
is post hoc.
In accordance with a clinical difference of 1 SD in the
prospective observational pilot data,22 we calculated that a
sample size of 182 evaluable subjects would produce 80%
power to detect a statistically significant difference in the
primary study outcome, with overall 2-sided a of 5.0% and
one interim analysis. The original study plan was to enroll
these patients during 2 complete snakebite seasons and
perform an interim analysis after the first season. However,
after the first full season it became clear that we would not
reach target enrollment and the decision not to perform an
interim analysis was made and communicated to all study
sites. This decision was made in a blinded fashion before
review or analysis of any data. According to pilot study
data, the original sample size was understood to be
underpowered for the additional outcome measures;
therefore, they did not affect the interim analysis decision.
RESULTS
Characteristics of Study Subjects
Seventy-six patients were randomized and 74 received
study drug (modified intent-to-treat population) (Figure 1).
Two patients were randomized, but withdrew from the
study before administration of the study drug. One patient
requested withdrawal because of a family emergency and
left the hospital against medical advice. The other patient
was unable to identify the snake as a copperhead. Forty-five
patients received FabAV and 29 received placebo. Sixty-
nine subjects (93.2%) completed the study through final
follow-up, with 2 withdrawals from the FabAV group and
3 from the placebo group. Baseline characteristics were well
balanced between groups (Table).

 The primary outcome, the least squared mean Patient-
Specific Functional Scale score on day 14, was 8.6 for
FabAV-treated subjects and 7.4 for placebo recipients
(difference 1.2; 95% confidence interval 0.1 to 2.3;
P¼.04).
The point estimates for the additional outcomes
routinely favored recovery in the FabAV group compared
with placebo. The difference in the point estimates of the
least squared mean Patient-Specific Functional Scale score
favored FabAV at all other measured points. Patient-
Specific Functional Scale total scores at each point are listed
in Table E1, available online at http://www.annemergmed.
com. Results from the limb-specific outcome measures;
Disorders of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand; Lower
Extremity Functional Scale; and grip strength, pain
assessments, and the global measure of recovery, PROMIS
PF-10, in general favored the FabAV group as well
(Figure 2A to F). No apparent difference was observed
between treatments in time to full recovery (score of 10) on
the Patient-Specific Functional Scale (Figure 2G) or
walking speed. Opioid analgesic use was less in the FabAV-
treated patients at all points (Figure 3). Two patients in
each group moved to rescue treatment (Table E2, available
online at http://www.annemergmed.com). No patients
required emergency unblinding of study group assignment.
All patients recovered by 4 months.
In the per-protocol population, the least squared mean
Patient-Specific Functional Scale score on day 14 was 8.4
for FabAV-treated subjects and 7.1 for placebo recipients
(difference 1.5; 95% confidence interval 0.4 to 2.7). No
important differences were observed between the modified
intent-to-treat and per-protocol analyses in supportive
outcome analyses.
More patients had adverse events determined to be
related to treatment per the blinded site investigator in the
FabAV group (16/45; 36%) than did the placebo group
(3/29; 10%). One patient in each group had a serious
adverse event as determined by the blinded site investigator
(Table E3, available online at http://www.annemergmed.
com). The most common adverse events were headache,
pruritus, nausea, dizziness, urticaria, and pyrexia. All
adverse events are presented in Appendix E1, available
online at http://www.annemergmed.com.
LIMITATIONS
This study had several limitations. It was designed and
funded to enroll for 2 full snakebite seasons, and
enrollment was concluded at this point without reaching
the target sample size. Even at target enrollment, the study
was known to be underpowered for its supportive analytic
endpoints. The trial was not stopped early for benefit and
consequently is not subject to the reported limitations of
this approach.43,44 However, the smaller-than-optimal
sample size leads to imprecision in the estimate of
treatment effect.

 The precise minimal clinically important difference in
snakebite is unknown. For other disease states previously
studied, the minimal clinically important difference is
generally in the range of the average treatment effect
observed in this trial.27,33-35 However, it remains unknown
how the difference varies by disease state, by upper versus
lower extremity, or how it varies along the ordinal Patient-
Specific Functional Scale. Additionally, the effect size
found in this study may be artificially lower because of
enrollment of a low-severity cohort. The majority (88%) of
subjects in this study had minor-severity swelling at study
entry. This is distinctly different from the subjects enrolled
in the copperhead pilot study conducted by our group in
many of the same study centers, 80% of whom had
moderate envenomation.22 We speculate this is because
patients with minor envenomation are more willing to
enroll in a placebo-controlled study than those with more
severe disease. Acknowledging these limitations, we believe
the benefit from FabAV administration observed in this
study is likely clinically important to patients because the
Patient-Specific Functional Scale reliably measures
functional outcomes that the patient chooses and values.
Although this trial included 18 centers, most patients
came from 3 sites in North Carolina and Texas. Because
there is some geographic variation in within-species venom
composition, the generalizability to all copperhead
envenomation populations is questionable.45 Thirteen
centers from West Virginia to Texas contributed subjects,
and exploratory analyses showed no apparent between-site
differences. We believe the results are generalizable to
copperhead victims as a whole, unless high-quality
geographically specific data contradict our findings. A
recent observational study in North Texas followed
copperhead envenomation patients by telephone.23
Although direct comparison is not possible, recovery
appeared to be faster than in either the copperhead recovery
pilot study or the present work.21
Children younger than 12 years, rattlesnake and water
moccasin victims, and patients with severe envenomation
were excluded from this study. There remains no direct
evidence of the effect of FabAV on recovery of limb
function in these populations. Because relatively few
adolescent and elderly patients enrolled in this study,
extrapolation from the overall results to these subgroups
should be done with caution.
Finally, cost is an important consideration with modern
antivenom use, and this study was not designed to support
a pharmacoeconomic analysis. Currently, the cost to the
hospital ranges from $2,000 to $2,900 per vial of FabAV.
The charge to the payer is typically a multiple of this and
includes the charge for care aside from the antivenom. The
cost to the individual patient varies widely, depending on
his or her insurance coverage. We suggest that the
relationship between cost, potential harm, and potential
benefits be discussed with patients during care.
DISCUSSION
In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
trial of adolescent and adult patients with mild- to
moderate-severity copperhead snake envenomation,
treatment with FabAV improved limb function recovery as
measured by Patient-Specific Functional Scale score at
envenomation plus 14 days. The greatest benefit of
antivenom therapy was experienced from 1 to 2 weeks after
treatment, and all patients experienced full recovery within
4 months. Robust additional assessments, determined a
priori, supported the primary study outcome, and no new
or major safety issues were identified compared with those
discussed in the existing literature.14,46
Before the development of highly purified, ovine-
derived FabAV, patients with nonlife-threatening
copperhead envenomation were generally managed
without antivenom because of the risks associated with
equine antivenom therapy.6 In addition to excluding
copperhead patients, the registry trials leading to Food and
Drug Administration approval of FabAV were
comparatively small (42 total subjects) open-label studies
designed to assess safety and short-term efficacy; limb
recovery was not evaluated.11,12
Before the current study, to our knowledge the only
investigations to prospectively assess limb recovery in
crotaline snakebite were an open-label observational
study22 and a small clinical trial published only in abstract
form.47 In addition, 2 studies reported the time to return to
full activities at work or school,7,10 1 study collected self-
reported data about resolution of pain, swelling, and
disability by telephone,23 and 1 study reported limb
outcomes in unstructured terms.5 As expected from the
heterogeneity of study design and outcomes assessed,
estimates of duration of disability produced by these studies
vary widely, and any important benefit from equine
antivenom or FabAV was impossible to assess.
To our knowledge, this trial provides the only blinded
prospective data on limb function recovery from crotaline
snake envenomation and provides important data that can
be used to inform risk-benefit discussions with patients
about the effect of antivenom on their recovery from
venom-induced limb injury. Although novel, these results
are concordant with existing clinical trial evidence of
FabAV efficacy in noncopperhead populations, using both
short-term outcomes and venom effects aside from limb
recovery.11,12,48 The consistency of these findings and the

 congruence of our additional outcome measures support
the findings of our primary outcome.
Existing guidelines on the care and treatment of
crotaline envenomation recommend treatment of mild
envenomation if venom effects are progressing.15,16
Progressive venom effects were not required for enrollment
in this trial. Previous research has shown that this approach
does not result in decreased antivenom administration.19
Therefore, the strategy of delaying antivenom
administration while watching for progression should be
further evaluated.17,19,48 This study also demonstrates that
crude outcome measures, such as the need for surgical
intervention, do not fully capture outcomes that are
important to patients.49
In this study, patients treated with FabAV had lower
pain scores and substantially less opioid use throughout
recovery. Because prescribing opioid analgesia carries some
risk of iatrogenic opioid abuse disorder and ED opioid
prescriptions may contribute to the development of
addiction, the role of FabAV in decreasing opioid
requirements during recovery is intriguing.50-54 Because
these findings are exploratory, future research is necessary
to determine the potential effect of FabAV treatment on
long-term opioid use after envenomation.
In conclusion, administration of FabAV to patients with
mild- and moderate-severity copperhead envenomation
improves recovery of limb function at 14 days
postenvenomation compared with placebo.

mITT, Modified intention-to-treat population.
Time from env. to treatment¼(date and time of first exposure to treatment–date and time of envenomation). PSFS total score¼sum of activity scores divided by the number of activities reported. Each activity is rated on a scale
of 0 to 10, where 0¼unable to perform activity and 10¼able to perform activity at the same level as before the injury or problem.
*A higher score indicates better recovery; best possible score is 10.
†The mITT population for the placebo group is composed of n¼29 patients. However, one patient in the mITT patient population did not have any posttreatment observations and therefore does not appear in this table.

Description
71/M
FabAV
Life threatening
Patient with a mild envenomation developed a severe pulmonary embolism after receiving
a full course of 18 vials of FabAV. The adverse event was considered not related to study
treatment by the investigator because the patient was recovering from recent spinal
surgery.
14/F
Placebo
Significant medical event,
prolonged hospitalization
Patient with a moderate envenomation and apparent good initial response to blinded study
medication (placebo), but developed worsening local tissue venom effects (tenderness,
ecchymosis, and edema) after the second maintenance dose of normal saline solution.
She did not have coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, hypotension, or other systemic
venom effects. The investigator discontinued study medication and administered 6 vials
of open-label FabAV as rescue therapy, with good response.
