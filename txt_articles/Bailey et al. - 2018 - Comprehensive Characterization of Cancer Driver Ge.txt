SUMMARY
Identifying molecular cancer drivers is critical for
precision oncology. Multiple advanced algorithms
to identify drivers now exist, but systematic at-
tempts to combine and optimize them on large da-
tasets
are
few.
We
report
a
PanCancer
and
PanSoftware
analysis
spanning
9,423
tumor
exomes (comprising all 33 of The Cancer Genome
Atlas projects) and using 26 computational tools
to catalog driver genes and mutations. We identify
299 driver genes with implications regarding their
anatomical sites and cancer/cell types. Sequence-
and
structure-based
analyses
identified
>3,400
putative missense driver mutations supported by
multiple lines of evidence. Experimental validation
confirmed 60%–85% of predicted mutations as
likely drivers. We found that >300 MSI tumors are
associated with high PD-1/PD-L1, and 57% of tu-
mors analyzed harbor putative clinically actionable
events. Our study represents the most comprehen-
sive discovery of cancer genes and mutations to
date and will serve as a blueprint for future biolog-
ical and clinical endeavors.
INTRODUCTION
Over the past decade, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has
coordinated a monumental enterprise of data generation and
genomic investigation across 33 cancer types. Numerous
notable findings have emerged from this project (https://
cancergenome.nih.gov/publications).
The
individual
TCGA
projects motivated the development of many bioinformatic
algorithms oriented toward discovery, characterization, and
prioritization of cellular processes driving cancer based on
pathways (Creixell et al., 2015), genes (Ding et al., 2014),
or individual variations (Gonzalez-Perez et al., 2013) (Key
Resources Table; STAR Methods). Despite this remarkable
progress, algorithms do not entirely agree on certain candi-
date
cancer
driver
genes
and
mutations,
necessitating
expert curation to filter likely false positive findings. Previous
PanCancer analyses (Tamborero et al., 2013b) have been
limited to fewer cancer types and have largely avoided nomi-
nating rare driver mutations.
TCGA is now concluding the most sweeping cross-cancer
analysis yet undertaken, namely the ‘‘PanCancer Atlas project.’’
This project includes the uniform analysis of all TCGA exome
data by the Multi-Center Mutation-Calling in Multiple Cancers
(MC3) network, yielding unbiased interpretation of the entire
10,437 tumor samples dataset (Ellrott et al. 2018). Here, we
describe our analysis of the MC3 somatic mutation set using
26 diverse bioinformatics tools (Figure S1A). Merging results
from these tools and manual curation ultimately identified 299
cancer genes. In parallel with functional validation in cell lines,
eight other tools and one novel aggregating algorithm charac-
terized mutations having the strongest phenotypic conse-
quences. Four additional tools leveraged protein structural
data to elucidate clusters of mutations in three-dimensional
space. Finally, the five remaining tools expounded on copy
number, RNA abundance, and clinical association using net-
works, machine learning, and database mining algorithms to
further corroborate mutation level findings. The systematic
and deep nature of these findings will serve cancer research
far into the future.

 RESULTS
Mutational Dataset and Driver Gene
Identification Power
Mutation calls were produced by the Multi-Center Mutation Call-
ing in Multiple Cancers (MC3) working group that harmonized the
results of seven algorithms (Ellrott et al. 2018) (STAR Methods).
To reduce the false-positive rate for driver gene discovery, we
implemented three strategies to optimize driver detection and
data quality (Figure S1B; STAR Methods). Briefly, we excluded
344 hypermutator samples because of artifactual sensitivity to
high background mutation rates (Figure 1A). All mutations that
passed the MC3 filter criteria were included. In addition, a less
stringent filter was applied to samples from ovarian serous cys-
tadenocarcinoma (OV) and acute myeloid leukemia (LAML) pro-
jects, as exome data for these two cancer types have distinct
characteristics not amenable to our standard filtering. Finally,
samples marked with inconsistent pathology were excluded.
Our driver detection dataset ultimately consisted of 9,079 sam-
ples having 1,457,702 total mutations (Figure S1B), where the
number of mutations per sample was widely distributed across
cancer types, as previously noted (Figures 1B and 1C) (Kandoth
et al., 2013; Lawrence et al., 2013; Tamborero et al., 2013b).
For individual cancer types, analyses were sufficiently pow-
ered to detect genes mutated at a median of 6.1% above back-
ground mutation rates (Figure 1D). Power largely correlated with
cohort size, with lower values observed for lymphoid neoplasm
diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBC) (25.5%, n = 37), cholangio-
carcinoma (CHOL) (20.5%, n = 34), and uterine carcinosarcoma
(UCS) (14.9%, n = 55) and the highest statistical power for breast
invasive carcinoma (BRCA) (2.3%, n = 779), brain lower grade
glioma (LGG) (2.8%, n = 510), and thyroid carcinoma (THCA)
(2.3%, n = 491). We saw modest increase in statistical power
for 12 individual cancer types previously analyzed by the TCGA
PanCancer effort (Kandoth et al., 2013), but the addition of 21 in-
dividual cancer types to our current PanCancer analysis
increased power to <1% prevalence (Figure S1C).
Landscape of Cancer Driver Genes
The final consensus list consists of 299 unique genes: 258 genes
obtained from a systematic approach and 41 additional genes
recovered after manual curation of previous TCGA marker pa-
pers with the majority (26 out of 41, 63%) supported by additional
-omics network tools not used in original significantly mutated
gene (SMG) detection studies (Figures 1A and S2; Table S1;
STAR Methods). Here, we focus on the 258 genes set, but
acknowledge the limitations of a systematic approach by
including the 41 manually rescued genes in our final list.
The list recovers most of the previously described driver genes
for the majority of cancer types. In fact, in 20 out the 31 cancer

Figure 1. Cancer Driver Gene Discovery Strategy, Power, and Mutations
(A) We identified six main steps to identify and discover driver genes in cancer: data curation, tool development, outlier adjustment, manual curation, downstream
tool analysis, and functional validation.
(B) Somatic mutations per sample are plotted for each sample and cancer type. Mutations are separated into SNVs (blue) and indels (green). The selected
hypermutator cutoff for each cancer is shown in red.
(C) Transition and transversion proportions are shown for six nucleotide changes. The stacked proportion bar chart is sorted by increasing transition/transversion
fraction.
(D) Statistical power for detection of cancer driver genes at defined fractions of tumor samples above the background mutation rate (effect size with 90% power) is
depicted. Circles indicate each of 33 cancer types placed according to the study sample size and median background mutation rate.

Figure 2. Cancer Driver Gene Discovery Workflow
(A) Circos (Krzywinski et al., 2009) plot displays 299 cancer genes. Each sector indicates a unique cancer type (text in blue) with predicted drivers unique to that
cancer type listed (gene name in black). Only tissues having at least one unique driver gene are shown. The top right sector shows all genes found significant in
multiple cancer types. Next, a categorical score of gold, silver, or bronze is assigned to each gene based on the highest consensus score. If a gene was not scored
and required rescue, then the field is empty. The next ring illustrates the mutation frequency of a gene. For the top-right wedge the PanCancer frequency is used,

 types included in our study that had either been previously pub-
lished or for which we had an internal list of known cancer driver
genes, the recovery rate is 80% or higher (Figures S2D and S2E).
The most significant outliers are stomach adenocarcinoma
(STAD) and the previous PanCancer study, for which we only
recovered around 70% of the previously described genes (Fig-
ure S2D). The consensus list also includes 59 novel genes that
had not been described previously and other known drivers
not previously associated with a given tissue (Table S1; STAR
Methods). Predictions of known cancer driver genes in new can-
cer types include ATRX in adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC),
KMT2C, CTNNB1, and PTEN in bladder urothelial carcinoma
(BLCA), and ARID1A and KRAS in BRCA. Entirely novel predic-
tions include GNA13 in BLCA (a homolog of the known drivers
GNAQ and GNA11), RRAS2 in uterine corpus endometrial
carcinoma (UCEC) (with shared homology in KRAS and HRAS),
and KIF1A in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC)
(a kinesin of the same family of the cancer driver KIF5B).
The number of detected cancer driver genes varies among
cancer types, with kidney chromophobe (KICH) having the
fewest (2 genes) and UCEC having the most (55 genes). Further-
more, the ratio of predicted tumor suppressor genes to
oncogenes widely varies by tissue (Figure S4B). We observed
a significant positive correlation (Pearson’s R = 0.66, p value =
4.1 3 10�5) between average mutation burden in a cancer type
and the number of identified consensus genes (Figure S3B).
Study-based calculations for powered effect size in each
cancer type did not entirely explain this phenomenon (Pearson’s
R = �0.31, p value = 0.09) (Figure S3C). Regarding the associa-
tions of driver genes with different cancer types, many genes
(142 out of 258) are associated with a single cancer, whereas
87 genes have driver roles in two or more cancer types, with
an additional 29 genes uniquely identified using PanCancer ap-
proaches on all samples combined. As expected, TP53 is the
most extreme case (27 cancer types), followed by PIK3CA,
KRAS, PTEN, and ARID1A, each of which is associated with
15 or more cancer types (Figures 2A and S4A).
We clustered cancer types according to the consensus scores
of their associated genes. Remarkably, some cancer types are
grouped by tissue of origin, such as LGG and glioblastoma multi-
forme (GBM), and others by cell of origin. The most significant of
the cell origin clusters spans all squamous cancer types (BLCA,
cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarci-
noma [CESC], esophageal carcinoma [ESCA], HNSC, and lung
squamous cell carcinoma [LUSC]) (permutation test, adjusted
p < 0.01) and includes several transcription factors (ZNF750,
NFE2L2, or KLF5), chromatin and histone modifiers (KMT2D,
EP300, or NSD1), and various PI3K pathway genes (PIK3CA,
PTEN, or MAPK1). We found two additional significant clusters
(permutation test, adjusted p < 0.05) that group gynecological
(UCS, CESC, UCEC, OV, and BRCA), as well as gastrointestinal
cancers (COADREAD, pancreatic adenocarcinoma [PAAD],
ESCA, and STAD) (Figures 2A and S4A; STAR Methods).
Finally, we classified the consensus driver genes by cancer-
related biological processes and associated pathways (Fig-
ure 2B; Table S2). For most genes, the categories (excluding
‘‘other’’ and ‘‘other signaling’’) clearly reflect known processes
involved
in
carcinogenesis,
namely
‘‘transcription
factor’’
(39 genes), ‘‘RTK signaling’’ (16) and ‘‘RNA abundance’’ (15),
‘‘protein homeostasis/ubiquitination’’ (15), ‘‘chromatin histone
modifiers’’ (15), ‘‘genome integrity’’ (14), ‘‘chromatin other’’
(14), and ‘‘immune signaling’’ (10). The last group is of particular
interest, given the connection between driver genes and immune
response (Thorsson et al., 2018). In terms of cancer types, most
have at least one cancer driver that belongs to either genome
integrity (28 out of 33 cancer types) or the MAPK or PI3K
signaling pathways (24 and 22 cancer types, respectively).
Notably, squamous cancer types have higher proportions of
chromatin histone modification genes, as well as receptor-tyro-
sine kinase and immune signaling.
Approaches to Driver Mutation Discovery
Not all mutations in a cancer driver gene have equal impact
(Torkamani and Schork, 2008), with consequences frequently
depending on position within the protein and amino acid change
(Carter et al., 2009). We explored this issue across the entire
PanCancer dataset, classifying 751,876 unique missense muta-
tions by examining the 299 identified cancer driver genes, ac-
cording to their predicted oncogenic effect. We combined the
output of three different categories of tools into consensuses ap-
proaches (STAR Methods): (1) tools distinguishing benign versus
pathogenic mutations using sequence (CTAT population); (2)
tools distinguishing driver versus passenger mutations using
sequence (CTAT cancer); and (3) tools discovering statistically
significant three-dimensional clusters of missense mutations
(structure based). These tool groups identified 10,098 (1.3% of
total missense mutations), 4,595 (0.6%), and 1,469 (0.2%)
unique amino acid substitutions, respectively (Figure 3A). Differ-
ences in the number of predicted driver mutations for each
approach are likely due to tool design and requirements, i.e.,
dependence of structural clustering tools on available three-
dimensional protein structures (either experimental or homol-
ogy-based) yields fewer predicted driver mutations.
When benchmarked against OncoKB (Chakravarty et al.,
2017), a manually curated dataset of cancer mutations anno-
tated according to likely oncogenic effect, cancer-focused
whereas cancer-type-specific frequencies are used in the remaining sectors. Where frequencies exceed the y axis limit of 10%, the innermost label indicates the
frequency (not shown are PIK3CA = 11.8% and TP53 = 37.5%). The final ring uses a five-point scale from orange to teal to represent each gene from likely tumor
suppressor to likely oncogene, respectively, according to the 20/20+ algorithm. Finally, in the top-right slice, we show hierarchical clustering of the gene
consensus scores for genes that were found in more than one cancer type (note: CRC refers to the COADREAD cancer type). Additionally, significant gene
clusters (permutation test) identified pan-gastrointestinal (red), pan-squamous (purple), and pan-gynecological tissues (green). The middle ring illustrates all
genes that were found only using PanCancer results or were otherwise rescued.

gynecological, pan-gastrointestinal, and pan-squamous are colored as indicated above.

 algorithms had superior predictive value than algorithms distin-
guishing benign and pathogenic mutations (Figure S5). The
CTAT cancer score outperformed all individual sequence-based
approaches.
Overall, 9,919 predicted cancer driver mutations in our cohort
(3,437 unique mutations) were identified by R2 approaches from
CTAT population, CTAT cancer, or structural clustering. These
mutations affect 5,782 tumor samples. These missense driver
mutations represent a greater fraction of the total mutations in
oncogenes than in tumor suppressors (Figure 3B). In this latter
group, most mutations seem to be truncations or frameshifts,
consistent with previous observations (Vogelstein and Kinzler,
2004). Nevertheless, some tumor suppressor genes also have
high numbers of missense driver mutations, such as EP300,
CREBBP, CASP8, PIK3R1, and TP53 (Figure 3B). An interesting
example is CDH1, which is primarily affected by truncating or
frameshift mutations in BRCA (75 out of 85 mutations), but
mostly targeted by missense driver mutations in STAD (21 out
of 25 mutations). This suggests differing roles for CDH1 in these
two cancer types.

Figure 3. Driver Mutation Discovery Approaches, Overview, Overlap, and Contrasts
(A) Venn diagram indicates the total number of mutations overlapping among three consensus approaches: CTAT population, CTAT cancer, and structural
clustering. Adjacent bar chart indicates the top 20 genes sorted by three-set intersecting mutation counts.
(B) Driver gene discovery identified gene-tissue pairs (canonical genes) in tumor suppressors and oncogenes. However, some gene-tissue pairs were not
identified in driver discovery (non-canonical). Mutation frequency from canonical and non-canonical cancer genes are displayed and divided among four mu-
tation classes: truncation/frameshift mutations (gray); missense mutations uniquely identified by only one approach (yellow, see A); missense mutations identified
by multiple approaches (red, see A); and missense passenger mutations not identified by any approach (off-white).
(C) Mutation percentage out of all missense and truncating/frameshift mutations within a gene is shown on the y axis (log scale). Point size is log scaled and
represents amino acid position frequency. The top 23 genes ordered by increasing mutational diversity (normalized entropy) and only the 9 most frequently
mutated amino acid positions for each gene are shown.

(A) Steps taken to assess consensus among mutation-level predictions using sequence-based and structural clustering tools and comparing them to an
orthogonal set of functionally validated mutations. From left to right: gray box represents missense mutations that were processed by 12 tools from three
categories (population-based, cancer-focused, and structural clustering tools) and combined into three consensus approaches (CTAT population, CTAT cancer,
and structural clustering). The total number and percentage of functionally validated/tested mutations are also shown.
(B) Number of mutations (y axis) found by structural tools for each gene (x axis) are shaded according to support by structural tools (green). Those mutations
without support are distinguished by two categories, with (gray) and without (white) available protein structure.

 We were intrigued by missense driver mutations detected in
cancer types where the gene was not predicted to be a driver.
This subset is particularly important for genotype-driven clinical
trials (Gagan and Van Allen, 2015). Overall, there are 1,719 tis-
sue-unmatched likely driver mutations (19% of the total) in 1,431
patients (16%) and 502 patients whose only predicted missense
driver mutations affect genes not yet known to play a role in that
cancer type. For example, we identified 28 patients with predicted
EGFRdrivermutationsincancertypeswhereEGFRisnotyetiden-
tified as a common driver gene, such as HNSC, STAD, LUSC,
UCEC, ESCA, and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC). In
extremecases,suchasERBB4 orGNAS,thesemutationsactually
represent the majority of predicted driver missense mutations in
the gene (Figure 3B). Additionally, we found that 2% (10/457) of
IDH1 missense events that occur at position R132 are found in
cancers not typically known to carry such mutations, i.e., BLCA
(n = 2), BRCA (2), COADREAD (2), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD)
(2), pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PCPG) (1), and thy-
moma (THYM) (1) (Figure 3C). Furthermore, we observed that
RRAS2Q72, a predicted oncogene in UCEC (n = 5 samples) with
strong homology to KRASQ61 and HRASQ61, was exceptionally
mutated in cancer types where it was not previously recognized:
UCS (n = 1), LUSC (1), LUAD (1), prostate adenocarcinoma
(PRAD) (1), HNSC (1), and TCGT (1). Any analysis focusing only
on driver genes and mutations known in that cancer type would
very likely miss presumed driver mutations for those patients.
Functionally Validated Mutations Confirm
Structure-Based Analysis
We used an independent dataset of 1,049 experimentally tested
somatic mutations to validate our driver mutation prediction
(Ng et al., 2018). Briefly, mutations were introduced in two cancer
cell lines, Ba/F3 and MCF10A, and were evaluated for oncoge-
nicity based on survival and growth (STAR Methods). In total,
160 mutations from 19 genes were validated in this dataset. The
percentage of functionally validated mutations increased from
60% predicted with CTAT population, to 61% for those found
by CTAT cancer, and 78% for structure-based analysis (Fig-
ure 4A). Among the 579 mutations predicted by all three ap-
proaches (Table S4), 39 of the 46 tested (85%) were validated.
Further, the sensitivity and specificity of identifying driver muta-
tions annotated by OncoKB suggests performance is generaliz-
able to larger gene sets (Figure S5E). These results support the
valueofthepredictionalgorithmsusedinourstudyandtheadvan-
tage of combining multiple tools. Also, we would like to note that
this approach only addresses true positive findings and repre-
sents a floor estimate for computational predictions.
Structural-based mutations clustered on 66 proteins, including
one cluster on KLF5, a gene not previously identified in
PanCancer studies and ranked among the top 30 clusters by
PanCancer mutation frequency (Figure 4B). We sought to further
examine predictions of the three approaches in various well-es-
tablished cancer driver genes, such as PIK3CA/PIK3R1, BRAF,
and KEAP1/NFE2L2 (Figures 4C–4H). The interface between
PIK3CA and PIK3R1 contains a cluster of mutations found by at
least two of the approaches and includes both validated muta-
tions and some not tested. D560G, N564D, and K567E are vali-
dated mutations that closely cluster to non-tested mutations
R577P/Q, S565R, and P568T in PIK3R1. Similarly, PIK3CA con-
tains validated mutations C378Y, V344G/M, N345T/I/K, P471L,
C420R,
and E418K clustering
with non-tested
mutations
S379T, N380S, and E418K. These non-tested mutations are
excellent candidates for further experimental validation due to
both their close proximity to known validated driver mutations
and their support from sequence-based approaches (Figures
4C and 4D). BRAF also contains clusters similar to this PIK3CA/
PIK3R1 cluster, with a mixture of validated and novel mutations
(Figures 4E and 4F).
Additionally, there are many genes that contain mutations
found by all three approaches, but that were not tested experi-
mentally, including KEAP1, NFE2L2, RHOA, MTOR, MAP2K1,
and VHL. Nevertheless, many of these driver mutations have
orthogonal evidence from OncoKB. For example, G333D/S mu-
tations in KEAP1 have an OncoKB status of likely oncogenic and
oncogenic, respectively (Figures 4G and 4H). Also, NFE2L2 mu-
tations cluster closely with KEAP1 mutations along the protein-
protein interface (D77, E82, G81, and E79). While they were not
experimentally validated, all have an OncoKB status of either
likely oncogenic or oncogenic. Other KEAP1 mutations in the
same cluster found by all three approaches are R483C,
Y525C, G524C, G571D, and R413H. However, none of these
mutations were tested in our dataset, nor have evidence from
OncoKB. Given their proximity to the validated KEAP1 sites
and the bioinformatic evidence that we found, these mutations
are ideal candidates for follow-up validation experiments.
Overall, this analysis demonstrates the complementarity
of sequence-based
and structure-based approaches. For
example, E365V, C604R, and C901F in PIK3CA, F646S in
PIK3R1, and H725Y and P731S in BRAF were found only by
the former and were experimentally validated (Figures 4D and
4F). Conversely, R462T in BRAF was only found by the latter
and is annotated as likely oncogenic in OncoKB (Figures 4F
and 4H).
Hypermutated Phenotypes and Immune Infiltrates
Environmental and biological factors, such as tobacco expo-
sure, UV, and microsatellite instability (MSI), contribute to the
tumorigenic hypermutator phenotype (Roberts and Gordenin,
(C–H) Heatmaps (D, F, and H) coupled with protein structures (C, E, and G) are shown in panels for proteins PIK3CA/PIK3R1 (PDB: 4OVU), BRAF (4MBJ), and
KEAP1/NFE2L2 (3ZGC), respectively, and display whether a particular mutation was detected by sequence-based (CTAT population or CTAT cancer) or
structure-based approaches (at least two structural tools). Purple/teal colors distinguish proteins (PIK3CA/PIK3R1 and KEAP1/NFE2L2 pairs) for mutations found
by structure-based approaches, and pink boxes indicate mutations found only by sequence-based approach. Additionally, for each mutation, frequency (blue
gradient), OncoKB status (red gradient), testing status (tan), and validation status (gray) are provided. All mutations found by structure-based approaches in each
of the three genes are shown with a few additional mutations that are only found by sequence-based approaches. Key mutations are highlighted from heatmaps
and labeled with white, gray, and tan labels referring to novel, validated, and tested (not validated) mutations, respectively.

 2014). Because many hypermutated samples were excluded in
the driver-discovery dataset, we performed additional analyses
to explore genes associated with this phenotype. Using mutation
signature analysis, we found that 90% (309/344) of the samples
that we labeled as hypermutated have MSI, UV, POLE, APOBEC,
or smoking as their primary signature (Figure 5A). MSI and POLE
are particularly prevalent, accounting for 56% of the hypermu-
tated samples. As expected, many cancer genes involved in
MSI and mismatch repair (MMR), i.e., POLE, MLH1, MSH3,
and MSH2 (Alexandrov et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2013), are
frequently mutated in these samples (Table S5; STAR Methods).
We expanded our analysis on mutation signatures by esti-
mating MSI status using MSIsensor (Niu et al., 2014) across all
samples (n = 9,423). 338 tumors have a score 4 (indicative of
an MSI-high phenotype). MSIsensor scores were correlated
with validated gel assays in a subset of hypermuated samples
(n = 180, multiple regression model, p value < 2 3 10�16,
r2 = 0.504; STAR Methods). We identified canonical MSI cancer
types (UCEC, colon adenocarcinoma [COAD], and STAD) as
having the highest average MSI scores across all samples (Fig-
ure 5B). We also observed 73 tumors with high MSI scores
from non-canonical cancers, i.e., 2% of OV (n = 7), and 2% of
CESC (n = 5). We observed that OV tumors have a higher
mean MSIsensor score when compared to other tissues, which
is consistent with previous findings (Cortes-Ciriano et al.,
2017). 4 of 5 CESC MSI samples harbored mutations in genes
known to be involved in MSI, including 1 sample with 2,644
somatic mutations that carried frameshift deletions in both
MLH3 and MSH3.
MSI cases show improved response to immune checkpoint
therapy, independent of histology (Brahmer et al., 2012; Gryfe
et al., 2000; Le et al., 2015). Thus, we tested whether the samples
with high MSIsensor scores exhibited similar patterns of immune
infiltration between environmental and biological mechanisms.
Using RNA-seq abundance data, we calculated PD-L1, PD-L2,
PD-1, CD8A, and CD8B expression in MSI-high and micro-
satellite stable (MSS) samples to identify via association those
samples that would likely benefit from immunotherapy (Fig-
ure 5C; STAR Methods). We observed a significant difference
between immune infiltrates when comparing samples with high
MSIsensor scores (R4) to others with low MSIsensor scores
(<4) from COADREAD, STAD, and UCEC (Figures 5C), in agree-
ment with previous findings about these cancer types. We then
tested whether the other three most prevalent signatures in hy-
permutators, i.e., smoking, UV, and APOBEC, have similar pat-
terns of immune infiltrate expression. However, only suggestive
evidence (t test, p value < 0.05) was found for PD-1 overexpres-
sion in hypermutated bladder cancer (BLCA) samples with the
APOBEC signature (Figure 5D). Together, these findings corrob-
orate the known relationship between total mutational burden
and expression of immune modulators, but suggest that MSI
may be particularly immunogenic. Additionally, an examination
of BRCA samples revealed that 11 of 12 hypermutated samples
harbor at least one mutation in MSI associated genes (1 with hy-
permethylated MLH1) and had increased expression in PD-L1,
PD-L2, and CD8A when compared to non-hypermutated cases
(t test p values < 0.01, < 0.01, and < 0.05, respectively; Fig-
ure S6A). Similar findings in CESC and LUSC illustrate potential
driver mechanisms in a subset of cases often overlooked in
driver gene discovery analysis (Figures S6B and S6C).
Therapeutic Implications of Molecular Events
We used two different databases to assess therapeutic implica-
tions of molecular events in our dataset: Precision Heuristics for
Interpreting the Alteration Landscape (PHIAL) (Van Allen et al.,
2014) and Database of Evidence for Precision Oncology
(DEPO; http://depo-dinglab.ddns.net). Both databases cast
therapeutic projections based on FDA-approved therapies, clin-
ical trials, published clinical evidence, and, in the case of PHIAL,
the TARGET database. PHIAL works at the gene level, whereas
DEPO focuses on specific mutations (STAR Methods). We
emphasize that, while the implications and results of this section
have been curated based on the literature, many of these results
are still undergoing rigorous scientific/clinical testing. However,
eligibility for clinical trials based on demonstration a particular
driver mutation still falls within the rubric of a clinically actionable
mutation.
We observed that both the fraction of samples and proportion
of alteration types varied across tissue types. By PHIAL heuris-
tics, 52% of all samples contained at least one putatively action-
able alteration (Figure 6A), while 65% of samples had at least one
putatively actionable or biologically relevant alteration from
TARGET. Using DEPO, we found that 30% of samples in our da-
taset had at least one clinically actionable mutation (Figure 6B).
Using PHIAL, the most common putatively actionable alter-
ations across the entire dataset were CDKN2A deletions
(13%), PIK3CA mutations (12%), MYC amplifications (8%),
BRAF mutations and amplifications (8%), and KRAS mutations
(7%). CDKN2A loss may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors
and affects over 40% of GBM, mesothelioma (MESO), and ESCA
patients. PIK3CA mutations, which may predict sensitivity to
PIK3CA inhibitors, affected 45% of patients with UCEC; MYC
amplifications, prognostic in glioma and pancreatic cancer,
were also present in 33% of OV samples. BRAF mutant samples
made up over half of THCA and skin cutaneous melanoma
(SKCM) patients, suggesting sensitivity to RAF inhibitors. Finally,
we also found high fractions of patients with pancreatic, colon,
rectum, and lung adenocarcinomas with KRAS mutations (be-
tween 70% and 30% in all cases). While these mutations are
currently of limited utility in untreated pancreatic and lung adeno-
carcinomas, they predict resistance to anti-EGFR therapies in
colorectal adenocarcinoma.
Similar to PHIAL, PIK3CA, BRAF, and KRAS contributed to the
most number of samples with potentially actionable alterations
from DEPO. SKCM, uveal melanoma (UVM), LGG, PAAD,
COAD, and THCA have higher prevalence of clinically actionable
alterations. When looking at the most common clinically action-
able alterations by cancer type (Figure S7D), some of the same
genes as PHIAL are key avenues for potential targeting, such
as BRAF (V600E) for SKCM. Some key differences occur for
uveal melanoma (UVM), in which GNAQ (Q209P) and GNA11
(Q209P/L) mutations are present in 34% and 43% of cases,
respectively. These mutations may be sensitive to MEK inhibitors
in SKCM undergoing clinical trials. Additionally, MEK inhibitors
are being deployed for UVM to target the GNAQ/GNA11 muta-
tions, but may require additional agents to show clinical benefit

 (Carvajal et al., 2014). For THCA, in addition to BRAF, NRAS mu-
tations (Q61R/K) are present in 8% of samples and could be sen-
sitive to MEK inhibitors via repurposing; some NRAS mutations
are sensitive in SKCM to MEK inhibition in clinical trials, particu-
larly when combined with CDK4 inhibition (Adjei et al., 2008; As-
cierto et al., 2013; Dummer et al., 2017; Iams et al., 2017).
PIK3CA mutations (H1047R/E545K/E542K) are also prevalent
in BRCA, CESC, and COAD at 24%, 20%, and 16%, respec-
tively, in addition to UCEC, and each of these cancer types could
also benefit from PI3K inhibition. Due to clinical realities and
context specific pathogenesis, these percentages likely repre-
sent a ceiling of current molecular intervention potential.
DISCUSSION
We performed a PanCancer and PanSoftware analysis of one of
the largest available cancer genomics datasets, identifying 299
cancer driver genes. The gene list is limited by focus on point
mutations and small indels without consideration of copy-num-
ber variations (Zack et al., 2013), genomic fusions (Yoshihara
et al., 2014), or methylation events (De Carvalho et al., 2012).
Nevertheless, it represents the most comprehensive effort thus
far to identify cancer driver genes and will serve as an important
research asset.
Many important issues in the field remain unresolved, for
example the similarity of driver gene sets across cancer types
(Hoadley et al., 2014), mutation order and timing (founder vs.
progression mutations) (Ding et al., 2012; McGranahan et al.,
2015), interactions among mutations (Raimondi et al., 2016),
the consequences of different mutations affecting the same
gene (Torkamani and Schork, 2008), reliable tools for distin-
guishing driver mutations from passengers (Greenman et al.,
2007), relationships between mutational signatures and driver
genes (Alexandrov et al., 2013), differences between mutation
burden and neoantigen load (Rizvi et al., 2015), and the implica-
tions for therapeutics (Van Allen et al., 2014). Using the

 consensus genes and the functional mutations found in this
study, we provided partial answers to these important questions.
For example, we identified a series of clusters grouping various
cancer types according to their cellular origin, highlighting
the importance of the pan-squamous, pan-gynecological, and
pan-gastrointestinal studies of the PanCancer Atlas.
Another important result is the dataset of 3,442 predicted
driver mutations from both sequence-based and three-dimen-
sional structure-based approaches. Because not all mutations
in driver genes are actually drivers themselves, identifying the
true-driver mutation subset remains a key challenge. We also
used an external, independent experimental dataset to success-
fully validate predictions from three different approaches that
predict cancer driver mutations. Our results suggest that can-
cer-specific sequence-based approaches outperform those
aimed at detecting pathogenic variants in general. Structure-
based approaches are more specific than sequence-based
approaches at predicting driver mutations, but with reduced
sensitivity. While functional validation confirmed true positive
predictions, it gives no information regarding false negatives.
Thus, what is reported here represents a lower bound. Our assay
was unable to capture other factors relevant to positive selec-
tion, such as tumor microenvironment, metastasis, interactions
with treatment, or the immune system. While caution must be
taken when extrapolating, these observations are consistent
with other functional studies on individual proteins or a subset
of the proteome that have shown that mutations affecting the
same three-dimensional functional regions are likely to have
similar phenotypes (Brenan et al., 2016). However, we also found
several
instances
in
which
sequence-based
approaches
captured driver mutations overlooked by structure-based ap-
proaches. Considering both approaches as complementary
can improve prediction sensitivity.
We estimate that approximately half of the 10,000 TCGA sam-
ples studied here harbor a clinically relevant mutation, by pre-
dicting either sensitivity or resistance to certain treatments or
clinical trial eligibility. For instance, the finding of GNAQ or
GNA11 mutation in uveal melanoma does not have a standard
of care treatment, but a canonical activating mutation in one of
these genes does allow consideration of a suite of rationally de-
signed clinical trials (such as MEK ± PI3K inhibitors and other ap-
proaches). Under these broader considerations, we estimate
that 57% (SD = 26.7%) of the TCGA cases harbor at least one
potentially clinically actionable target.
The findings reported here and by the larger TCGA enterprise
represent early steps toward a new era in cancer research and
ultimately in cancer treatment. Studies will move beyond
focusing on individual genes toward systematically integrating
the myriad aspects of the cancer genome, including the interre-
lationships among its somatic and germline variations (Carter
et al., 2017) and the tumor microenvironment and the immune
system (Thorsson et al., 2018). Although this study represents
the largest cancer gene and mutation study to date, we are mind-
ful that the corpus of cancer driver genes and mutations may still
be incomplete. However, it is likely that the community is nearing
the beginning of the end of this phase of research, as larger co-
horts continue to be examined with longer-range and longer-
read sequencing technologies.

 METHOD DETAILS
Data Preparation
A publicly available MAF file (syn7824274, https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications/mc3-2017) was recently compiled by the
MC3 Working Group and is annotated with filter flags to highlight potential artifacts or discrepancies. This dataset represents the
most uniform attempt to systematically provide mutation calls for TCGA tumors. The MC3 effort provided consensus calls from 7
software packages (Ellrott et al., 2018). Flagged artifacts include: non-exonic regions, whole-genome amplified (WGA) samples,
exclusion lists, blood/tumor derived pairs, strand-bias, contamination estimations, oxo-guanine artifacts, low normal read depth,
polymorphisms common in EXAC (Lek et al., 2016), mutations present in a panel of normal samples, non preferred tumor normal
pairs, and mutations outside the regions of interest for any caller. If a mutation was not assigned any flag and was called by 2 or
more variant calling software packages, it received a ‘PASS’ identifier. We restricted our analysis to PASS calls with the exception
of samples from OV and LAML, which were some of the earliest sequenced by TCGA. Preparations for these samples utilized whole
genome amplified (WGA) DNA, an important factor in that the WGA process can induce artifactual mutations. Of the 412 OV and 141
LAML samples present in our data 347 (84%) and 141 (100%), respectively, had variants derived from WGA DNA. In order to maintain
sample sizes and uniformity in mutation calling, we did not filter mutations containing only ‘wga’ filter tags from these two cancer
types. We recognize multiple limitations of this mutation call set, including the lack of structural variants and copy number alterations,
as well as variability in sequencing depth and tumor purity. The above limitations may lead to variability in mutation detection; how-
ever, the MC3 dataset reflects the state-of-the-art in consensus mutation detection.
We also excluded highly mutated samples. These hypermutators were defined as samples with a mutation count exceeding Tukey’s
outlier condition,i.e.,greater than1.5 times the interquartile range above the third quartilein theirrespective cancer types (3Q + 1.5*IQR).
Designation as a hypermutator also required the number of mutations in a sample to exceed 1,000, a heuristic that limited the number of
discarded samples in low mutation rate cancer types (Figure S1). LUAD, SKCM, and UCEC had hypermutator thresholds greater than
1,000 mutations(1,047,2,122,and 2,545,respectively)(Figure1B).Wealsoexcluded samplesthatwereflaggedbytheanalysis-working
group based on pathology, but allowed ‘‘RNA degradation’’ samples to remain, as this factor is not particularly relevant for most driver
prediction

(Table S6). The final driver-discovery dataset consisted of 9,079 samples having a total of 791,637 missense mutations, 323,884 silent
mutations, 96,196 30 UTR mutations, 57,900 nonsense mutations, 42,251 intronic mutations, 42,251 Frameshift deletions, 34,266
50 UTR, 21,804 splice site mutations, 19,856 RNA mutations, 11,305 frameshift insertions, 7,622 30 flanking mutations, 6,419 50 flanking
mutations, 6,144 in-frame deletions, 1,362 translation start site mutations, 964 nonstop mutations, and 632 in-frame insertions.
Driver Discovery Approach
Using multiple tools can overcome numerous technical issues that confound individual statistical analyses to find driver genes, such
as heterogeneous mutation rate across the genome (Lawrence et al., 2013), inflated significance for long genes (Watson et al., 2013),
and false positive calls in cancers with high mutation rates (Tokheim et al., 2016b). We used 26 computational tools, spanning 10
different institutions, to identify mutation-based driver genes and driver mutations (Figure S1A). We divided the analysis into two
phases: (I) driver gene-discovery and (II) gene and in-silico mutation validation (Figure 1C; STAR Methods). In the first phase, we
applied 8 different tools comprising algorithms based on mutation frequency (MuSiC2 [Dees et al., 2012] and MutSig2CV [Lawrence
et al., 2014]), features (20/20+ [Tokheim et al., 2016b], CompositeDriver [https://github.com/khuranalab/CompositeDriver] and
OncodriveFML [Mularoni et al., 2016]), clustering (OncodriveCLUST [Tamborero et al., 2013a]), and externally defined regions
(e-Driver [Porta-Pardo and Godzik, 2014] and ActiveDriver [Reimand and Bader, 2013]). The second phase used an additional 16
tools to further characterize the consensus genes from phase one. The collection was comprised of 8 mutation-level algorithms
(SIFT [Ng and Henikoff, 2002], PolyPhen2 [Adzhubei et al., 2013], MutationAssessor [Reva et al., 2011], transFIC [Gonzalez-Perez
et al., 2012], fathmm [Shihab et al., 2013], CHASM [Carter et al., 2009], CanDrA [Mao et al., 2013] and VEST [Carter et al., 2013]),
4 structure-based (HotSpot3D [Niu et al., 2016], HotMAPS [Tokheim et al., 2016a], 3DHotSpots.org [Gao et al., 2017] and e-Driver3D
[Porta-Pardo et al., 2015]), 2 network and –omic integration tools (OncoIMPACT [Bertrand et al., 2015], DriverNet [Bashashati et al.,
2012]), and 2 algorithms to identify clinically-actionable events (PHIAL [Van Allen et al., 2014] and DEPO [S.Q. Sun, R.J. Mashl, S.
Sengupta, A.D. Scott, W. Wang, P. Batra, L.-B. Wang, M.A. Wyczalkowski, L. Ding, unpublished data]). Each tool reported gene
or mutation level scores and/or p values along with a brief description of recommended cutoff thresholds or filters. Finally, the
CTAT algorithm was applied separately to population based and cancer based tools. This accounts for the remaining 2 tools (this
manuscript) for a total of 26 tools (https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications#/?groups=PanCanAtlas).
Tools integrating –omics data analyzed a smaller subset of TCGA, since we had to remove 75 samples that had problems regarding
RNA-degradation. This issue did not affect the algorithms based only on somatic mutation data, so these 75 samples were included
in their analyses (Table S6).
Standardized Result Reporting
Despite the variety in available data within the TCGA cohort, each of the 26 tools supplied tissue and PanCancer level predictions and
results. We defined a standardized file format to facilitate multi-tool comparison, so each tool supplied information on genes, tran-
scripts, missense mutations, scores, p values, q-values and additional information needed for tool specific requirements.

 Creation of A High Confidence Gene Set
We identified a preliminary total of 2,101 potential drivers by taking the union of genes predicted by the eight driver-gene discovery
tools. As illustrated in Figure S2A, the increased number of false positive genes is likely due to any individual tool’s capability to
maintain sound statistical properties that handle a complex set of factors such as tumor heterogeneity, increased mutation rates,
and variable sample sizes. We refined this list by calculating, for each gene predicted in each cancer type, a consensus score
that compensated for outlier results and correlation among tools (Figure S2 and Table S1; https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/
publications#/?groups=PanCanAtlas). The consensus score was defined as a weighted sum of the number of tools that predicted
the gene to be a driver in each cancer type (see Gene Discovery Weighting Strategy). We required a minimum of two tools to agree,
where both could not be outliers (score R 1.5). Although it is difficult to distinguish the overall performance improvement on a small
number of held out CGC genes (Figure S3A), the weighting strategy did have higher specificity (p = 4.3e-8, McNemar test), which is
preferable given concerns of false positives. Regardless, the consensus score performance on identifying CGC genes (Figure S3A)
support previous reports that merging the results from different algorithms improve cancer driver discovery (Tamborero et al., 2013b).
To maximize the coverage of our analysis and ensure the accuracy of our final list, we reviewed previous findings in 31 individual
cancer types and PanCancer-12 from TCGA. For cancer types not yet having a TCGA publication, we consulted with the relevant
analysis working groups (LIHC, testicular germ cell tumors [TGCT], UVM, sarcoma [SARC], PAAD, and THYM). We included in our
final consensus list all those genes that were previously described as drivers by experts in the cancer-specific analysis of TCGA data-
sets and were also identified by at least one of the eight algorithms, even if they did not meet our consensus score threshold (R1.5)
(Figure 2A). This resulted in an additional 54 gene-cancer pairs, such as ATR, CHEK2, IDH2, and ERCC2 in the PanCancer dataset
and FOXA1 in BLCA, HRAS in SKCM, and MET in LUAD (Figures S2B–S2F). The majority of this effort resulted in linking cancer genes
identified by our strategy to additional cancer types based on previous literature (32/54).
The process of identifying genes in previous TCGA publications consisted in the following steps:
1. We manually reviewed all the official marker papers for each cancer type of The Cancer Genome Atlas. When no official paper
was yet available, we contacted the lead analyst of the cancer type to access the official list of cancer driver genes.
2. We listed all the genes that were identified in the main text of one of the main figures of the corresponding paper as significantly
more mutated than expected by chance.
3. Once we had the genes from each cancer type, we checked whether these genes had also been identified in our analyses by, at
least, one algorithm. Note that both the mutation calls and the samples from the original TCGA paper and our analysis of each
cancer type differ to some extent, so it is possible that genes which were previously identified by MutSigCV or MuSiC are not
found by these algorithms in our analysis.
4. If a gene had been identified in the dedicated cancer type, deemed important enough to be highlighted in the main text/figure of
the paper, and was also identified by at least one of our 8 gene-level discovery tools, we rescued it for our final list (Table S1).
To limit false positives in the expanded list, we applied linear discriminant analysis (Figure S2C) (see Likely False Positive Gene
Filter). We identified and removed 45 genes from the consensus we detected as likely false positives. These included CACNA1E
in PanCancer, COL11A1 in LUAD, DST in GBM, and TTN in SKCM. The consensus list from the above systematic approach consisted
of 258 unique genes (Table S1). The average number of non-silent mutations per sample in our consensus gene list varied substan-
tially by cancer type ranging from < 1 in 12 cancer types (ACC, CHOL, KICH, kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma [KIRP], LAML,
MESO, PCPG, PRAD, SARC, TGCT, THCA, and THYM) to 7.3 in UCEC. A median of 85% of tumors harbored non-silent mutations
in consensus genes across cancer types (Figure S3F).
Given the limitations of a systematic approach, we additionally manually rescued 41 genes (Table S1). In the rescue attempt, we
started with a list of genes identified from previous TCGA marker papers but not found from our systematic approach. We rescued
genes with supportive evidence from the following sources: hypermutator phenotype related genes (since we excluded hypermu-
tated samples in our systematic discovery; 6 genes), established cancer genes from LAML because of low quality variant calling
originating from liquid tumor contamination of the normal samples (6 genes), genes supported by omic network tools (DriverNet
and OncoIMPACT; 25 genes), and a gene supported by all three approaches from the driver mutation discovery (1 gene). Addition
of genes to the final list was subjected to expert manual curation (3 genes).
The final consensus gene list consisted of 299 unique genes across 33 cancer types and the PanCancer dataset (Figure 2A;
Table S1). The list captures most previously described driver genes for the majority of cancer types. We overlapped the cancer driver
genes obtained from the consensus approach without manual curation with those from 5 independent studies in 4 cancer types
(BRCA, PRAD, PAAD, and LIHC) of which one is whole-genome sequencing. The consensus approach always had a greater in-
ter-study overlap, with an average increase of 26% over only using a single tool, either MuSiC2 or MutSig2CV (Barbieri et al.,
2012; Biankin et al., 2012; Nik-Zainal et al., 2016; Schulze et al., 2015; Stephens et al., 2012) (Table S3). Among the 299 genes
we identified 59 novel genes that were not previously identified in 6 previous PanCancer publications (Frampton et al., 2013; Kandoth
et al., 2013; Lawrence et al., 2014; Pritchard et al., 2014; Tamborero et al., 2013b; Vogelstein et al., 2013) or the cancer gene census
list (http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/census/) (Futreal et al., 2004) (Table S1).

 Gene Discovery Weighting Strategy
Toolspredicting cancergeneswereweightedaccording totheir performanceineach cancer type,receivinghalftheweightifaresultwas
deemed an outlier, therebyobligating additional tool agreement (Figure S2A). Specifically, we examined quality metrics across tools and
within the same tool, which allowed us to identify outlier results. We marked outliers based on the quasi-majority of three criteria: low
concordance with known cancer genes, high divergence of p value distribution from theoretical expectation, and abnormally high num-
ber of significant genes. The first criterion evaluated the fraction overlap of significant genes with a previously manually curated set of
driver genes from (Vogelstein et al., 2013) compared with the median across all tools. The second criterion examined whether the diver-
gence of observed p values from those theoretically expected by the Mean Log Fold Change (MLFC) (Tokheim et al., 2016b) was greater
than the median of all tools, which may indicate a tool’s statistical assumptions may not be well satisfied. The third criterion examined
whether a tool’s prediction for particular cancer types appeared as an outlier in terms of the number of significant genes compared
against all of the results for that tool (Tukey’s outlier criterion: number significant > 3Q + 1.5*IQR). We calculated a gene consensus score
by summing the tools that declared the gene as being significant, with a weight of 1 for non-outlier results and 0.5 for outlier results.
We also provided a score that is more stringent, which could be used by others to create a somewhat smaller set of confident driver
genes (Table S1). Here, due to similarities in algorithmic decisions, we adjusted these consensus gene scores to compensate for
correlation between tools of the same class (i.e., frequency, feature, and domain based tools). The contribution of a tool whose infer-
ence is uncorrelated with other tools is recorded by simple addition of its score to the running total. However, some tools show cor-
relation at sufficient levels that their contributions should properly be considered in aggregate. For example, MuSiC2 and MutSig2CV
are highly correlated, as are CompositeDriver and OncodriveFML (Figure S2G). For such tool pairs, we actually add the union of their
scores, S1 U S2, to the running total in the form of
S1 WS2 = S1 + S2 � S1 XS2 = S1 + S2 � 9
2
S1 + S2
ð
Þ =
1 � 9

(Eq. 1)
where r is the Pearson’s coefficient between these two tools. We applied this procedure for pairs of tools whose variances exceeded
10%, i.e., for correlations greater than 0.32. Small changes of this threshold did not have any meaningful effect.
Driver Mutation Discovery
To maximize the coverage of our analysis we used 12 tools that look for three distinct hallmarks of ‘‘driverness.’’ We utilized four tools
that distinguish pathogenic mutations from benign polymorphisms on a population level (SIFT [Ng and Henikoff, 2002], PolyPhen2
[Adzhubei et al., 2013], VEST (version 3 scores) [Carter et al., 2013] and MutationAssessor [Reva et al., 2011]), four tools specifically
designed to distinguish between driver and passenger somatic mutations (CHASM [Wong et al., 2011], CanDrA [Carter et al., 2013],
fathmm [Shihab et al., 2013] and transFIC [Gonzalez-Perez et al., 2012]) and four tools that leverage information from protein struc-
tures (HotSpot3D [Niu et al., 2016], HotMAPS [Tokheim et al., 2016a], 3DHotSpot.org [Gao et al., 2017] and e-Driver3D [Porta-Pardo
et al., 2015]). In order to combine the predictions from the sequence-based approaches we used principal component analysis to
develop a Combined Tool Adjusted Total (CTAT) scores for both, population-based and cancer-specific scores (STAR Methods).
Principal component analysis has been previously shown successful in a similar task of prioritizing germline mutations (Ionita-
Laza et al., 2016). We also combined the results from three-dimensional tools by adding the number of tools that predicted a specific
position as belonging to a cancer-mutation cluster. Finally, to limit the number of false positives, we focused our analysis on the genes
of our consensus driver list.
To define the CTAT score thresholds, we used the maximum balanced accuracy when predicting OncoKB mutations ‘‘oncogenic’’
or ‘‘likely oncogenic’’ (Figures S5C and S5D). This yielded a threshold of 1.2 for CTAT-population and 2.4 for CTAT-cancer. For the
structural algorithms, we report a mutation as likely driver if at least 2 algorithms identify it within a cluster. Finally, we evaluated the
performance of each CTAT score using mutations from OncoKB labeled as ‘‘likely oncogenic’’ or ‘‘oncogenic’’ as true-positives.
Experimental Validation Data
For experimental validation to assess tool performance, we utilized experimental data provided by Gordon Mills at MD Anderson
Cancer Center (Ng et al., 2018). 1049 mutations were tested in 2 growth-factor dependent cell models, Ba/F3 and MCF10A. Both
models depend on specific growth factors for survival, with which they cease proliferating. It is hypothesized that a mutation is a
driver if it confers survival advantage to cells even in the absence of these growth factors. Mutations were introduced in the cells
and the dependent growth factors were withdrawn; subsequently, cell viability was measured. Every experiment had 2 negative
controls, 3 positive controls, and a corresponding wild-type (WT) of the mutation tested. In general, we considered a mutation to
be ‘validated’ if the cell viabilities of the mutations were higher than those of the wild-type.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical Power Analysis of Driver Gene Identification
We performed the statistical power analysis of driver gene identification at various prevalences (effect size = 0.1, 0.05, 0.02, and
0.01, fraction of samples above background) with 90% power, based on a previously established approach of elevated mutation
rate (Lawrence et al., 2014). We used a binomial model implementation (https://github.com/KarchinLab/cancerSeqStudy),
Cell 173, 371–385.e1–e9, April 5, 2018
e4
 previously described (Tokheim et al., 2016b). Default parameters were used. We placed each cancer type or PanCancer analysis
according to the median mutation rate (per mega base) and number of samples (n shown in Figure 1C). Mutation rate per mega
base was calculated through using sequencing coverage of samples obtained from the MuSiC2 analysis.
Anatomical Clustering of Cancer Driver Genes
We performed hierarchical clustering of the gene consensus scores for the 87 genes that were found in more than one cancer type
(Figure S3E), thereby clustering both genes and cancer types (n = 32 cancer types, COAD and READ merged by maximum consensus
gene score). The correlation distance metric and average linkage were used to avoid clustering purely based on the total number of
consensus genes for a cancer type. Clusters of genes were defined based on cutting the dendrogram at a depth chosen by manual
inspection. Each gene cluster was tested for enrichment in three groups of cancer types using a permutation test: Pan-squamous
(BLCA, CESC, LUSC, HNSC, and ESCA), Pan-gynecological (BRCA, UCEC, UCS, CESC, and OV), and Pan-gastrointestinal
(STAD, COADREAD, ESCA, and PAAD). This involved, for each cluster and group of cancer types, an initial calculation of the total
gene consensus score from the observed data. Labels for the cancer types were then permuted 10,000 times and the total gene
consensus score was subsequently recalculated based on the permuted cancer type labels. Lastly, P values were calculated as
the fraction of permuted iterations that met or exceeded the observed total gene consensus score. P values were then multiple
test corrected across all genes using the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR method.
Likely False Positive Gene Filter
We attempted to harness the collective ability of the analysis tools in order to remove remaining genes that were likely false positives
using Fisher’s linear discriminant analysis (LDA). This is a PanCancer filter in the sense that we selected features by manually exam-
ining 4 attributes for each of the tools. Specifically, for each gene, we compiled average P value over all cancers and the Pearson
correlation coefficient, regression slope, and y-intercept of a least-squares fit between the cancer background mutation rates and
tool P values. We then looked for the largest difference of means in units of standard deviations for these 4 attributes between a
set of true positive list in the form of the 127 genes from Kandoth et al., 2013 versus an internally-curated list of 488 false positives
(Table S7). We ultimately chose 4 features: the correlation coefficient from MuSiC2, the average P values from OncodriveFML and 20/
20+, and the y-intercept from 20/20+. To harness these features collectively, we then solved the LDA linear algebra problem using
decomposition, where the coefficient matrix is comprised of the within-groups variances, the vector of unknowns contains the
feature weights, and the right hand side is the vector of the difference of means of the features. We then chose a conservative
cut-point such the true positives were unlikely to be caught in the filter, reflecting 90% sensitivity for keeping associations found
in Cancer Gene Census genes. Using the 4 LDA weights and the cut-point, we then ran the candidate gene list through the filter,
removing all genes that failed the cut-point. However, we omitted from this filtering any gene already established as being a cancer
gene and any ‘‘out-of-context’’ gene, meaning ones that showed obvious specificities to a single cancer.
Ctat Score
We developed the Combined Tool Adjusted Total (CTAT) score to distinguish missense mutations that are cancer drivers from pas-
senger mutations. The CTAT score combines multiple individual tools that prioritize missense mutations. To normalize each score,
we calculated the z-score by subtracting the mean score and then dividing by the standard deviation. We then performed principal
component analysis (PCA) using ScikitLearn v0.18.0 and used the score along the first principal component as our CTAT score, rep-
resenting the scalar projection onto the first eigenvector. Only missense mutations that had no missing values for each of the com-
bined tools were used in generating the principal component analysis. We performed this procedure on two distinct categories of
tools, ‘‘population-based’’ tools that distinguish damaging/pathogenic germline missense variants from common polymorphisms
(SIFT, PolyPhen2, VEST, and MutationAssessor), and ‘‘cancer-focused’’ tools designed to distinguish somatic missense mutations
that are drivers from passengers (CHASM, CanDrA, fathmm, and transFIC). To score the remaining missense mutations that did have
a missing score, we imputed missing scores of the individual tool with the mean for the method. Imputation was only performed for
the cancer-focused tools as the population-based tools had too many missing values.
Normalized Entropy Score
We calculated a score to characterize consensus genes on their diversity of amino acid positions that contain either missense, frame-
shift, or truncating mutations. Because genes may be of different length and have different background mutation rates, we used a
normalized entropy score (E) (Tokheim et al., 2016b):
E = �Pn
i = 1pðiÞlog2ðpðiÞÞ
log2ðnÞ
;
(Eq. 2)
where, for each gene, n is the total number of mutated positions and p(i) represents the fraction of mutations for the i-th mutated
position. The normalized entropy score takes values between 0 and 1, with values closer to one indicating an even spread of muta-
tions across all mutated positions.

 Hypermutators and Immune Infiltrates
Hypermutator samples were defined above as those tumors with mutation counts greater than 1.5 times the interquartile range above
the third quartile in their respective cancer types (3Q + 1.5*IQR). Additionally, mutations in a sample needed to exceed 1000, a
heuristic that limited the number of discarded samples in low mutation rate cancer types (Figure S1). Three cancer types, LUAD,
SKCM, and UCEC, had hypermutator thresholds greater than 1000 mutations (1047, 2122, and 2545 respectively) (Figure 1B).
18 global mutational signatures were originally calculated for each of the hypermutator samples according to Alexandrov et al.,
2013 with a minimum cosine similarity ranging from 0.57 to 0.99. These signatures were then aggregated into the 9 representative
signatures presented: POLE was comprised of ‘‘POLE’’ and ‘‘MSI - COSMIC14 (POLE+MSI)’’; MSI combined ‘‘MSI - COSMIC15,’’
‘‘MSI - COSMIC20 (POLD+MSI),’’ ‘‘MSI - COSMIC21,’’ ‘‘MSI - COSMIC26,’’ and ‘‘MSI - COSMIC6’’; COSMIC signature 5 combined
‘‘COSMIC5,’’ and ‘‘ERCC2 - COSMIC5,’’ unknown is comprised of ‘‘Unknown’’ (many of which were attributable to noise from WGA
and 3 hypermutated samples were not performed in this analysis); UV, smoking, APOBEC, COSMIC1, and COSMIC5 signatures did
not require aggregation; and other was comprised of ‘‘COSMIC17,’’ ‘‘COSMIC22 - aristolochic acid signature’’ and ‘‘COSMIC3 –
BRCA’’ (Figure 5A). A primary signature for each sample was calculated by identifying as the max score from each signature.
MSIsensor (Niu et al., 2014) was applied to all 9,423 samples in our dataset. We used the authors’ recommended cut-off of greater
than or equal to 4 in order to indicate MSI-High status. Scores below 4 cannot reliably distinguish been MSI-Low and MSS. More
information on this tool is found in DATA AND SOFTWARE. 357 scores were generated from BAM files other than those used for
variant calling by the MC3 Working group. Of the 357 samples, 29 had MSIscores greater than or equal to 4. 16 of these 29 samples
(55%) had at least one frameshift/nonsense, missense mutatiation in gene involved in MSI or MMR phenotype (POLE, MLH1, MLH3,
MGMT, MSH6, MSH3, MSH2, PMS1, or PMS2) or had high MLH1 methylation. Results from 180 gel-assays were provided by The
Broad Institute to assess MSIsensor scores. Using a multiple regression model, quantitative MSI scores correlated with qualitative
results from the gel-assay (MSI-H, MSI-l, and MSS, p value < 2x10�16, r2 = 0.504); thus, justifying the use of MSIsensor.
PD-L1, PD-L2, PD-1, CD8A, and CD8B RPPA expression data were collected from FIREHOSE (January 28, 2016). By cancer type,
samples were stratified by MSIsensor score status (Figure 5C), hypermutatator and mutation signatures status (Figure 5D), and hy-
permutator status alone (Figures S6A–S6C). Significance was calculated using two-sided t test statistics.
Druggability and Clinical Association
PHIAL is a heuristic clinical interpretation algorithm and database of tumor alterations relevant to genomics-driven therapy (TARGET)
and was created in 2014 to identify putatively actionable or biologically relevant alterations in patient tumor sequence data. Although
it was developed to study patients individually, PHIAL was applied to all 8775 samples that had both SNV/indel and thresholded copy
number data available across TCGA MC3 and all 33 individual TCGA studies. PHIAL (1.2.0) using TARGET 1.4.2 and Cosmic v79 was
applied to all 8775 samples that had both SNV/indel and thresholded copy number data available across TCGA MC3 and all 33 in-
dividual TCGA studies. TARGET contains 50 alteration-therapeutic assertions based on FDA-approved therapies, clinical trials, or
published clinical evidence of genetic alteration-therapeutic action relationships which was leveraged by PHIAL to bin variants as
putatively actionable, if both the gene and alteration type match an assertion, or biologically relevant, if only the gene matches.
DEPO version 1.0 (S.Q. Sun, R.J. Mashl, S. Sengupta, A.D. Scott, W. Wang, P. Batra, L.-B. Wang, M.A. Wyczalkowski, L. Ding,
unpublished data; http://depo-dinglab.ddns.net) is a manually curated database of single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs
(missense, frameshift, and nonsense mutations), in-frame insertions and deletions (indels), copy number variations (CNVs), and
expression changes that are paired with drug responses. For present purposes, we focused strictly on SNPs and indels. For each
variant-drug pair, there is an associated tumor type, an effect (sensitive or resistant), and a level of evidence describing the quality
of data supporting the pair at various stages of approval: FDA-approved, clinical trials, case reports, and preclinical. We queried our
samples for presence of druggable alterations from DEPO regardless of cancer type. The cancer type that had the highest level of
evidence for a drug-variant pair was considered the ‘‘on-label’’ cancer type and all other cancer types were deemed to be ‘‘off-label’’
(Figure S7D). Cancer types containing an off-label variant were still considered to be ‘druggable’ via repurposing.
DATA AND SOFTWARE AVAILABILITY
Algorithms used to create the consensus list
20/20+
20/20+ is a Random Forest machine learning algorithm for predicting oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes from somatic muta-
tions. 20/20+ uses features capturing mutational clustering, evolutionary conservation, predicted functional impact of variants, mu-
tation consequence types, gene interaction network connectivity, and other relevant covariates. 20/20+ version 1.1.0 was run using
default parameters, as described previously (Tokheim et al., 2016b), except where the number of simulations was increased to
100,000. We applied gene hold-out cross-validation to perform predictions without over-fitting. Additionally, for cancer type specific
predictions, we held out all mutations from the corresponding cancer type in our training set. P value QQ-plots suggest well-cali-
brated predictions that are not inflated for false positives and results show substantial overlap with the cancer gene census (Futreal
et al., 2004) and curated driver genes (Vogelstein et al., 2013). Genes were deemed significant if either the oncogene, tumor suppres-
sor gene, or driver score had a q-value of less than or equal to 0.05. 20/20+ was also used to categorize the consensus genes as
Cell 173, 371–385.e1–e9, April 5, 2018
e6
 either a oncogene, tumor suppressor gene, or unknown. A ‘‘likely’’ oncogene or tumor suppressor gene was determined using
q-value threshold of 0.05, while ‘‘possible’’ status was assigned to the remaining genes with a p value less than or equal to 0.05.
MutSig2CV
MutSig2CV (Lawrence et al., 2014) analyzes somatic point mutations discovered in DNA sequencing, identifying genes mutated more
often than expected by chance given inferred background mutation processes. Genes were deemed significant at a q-value
threshold of 0.1. MutSig2CV consists of three independent statistical tests, described briefly below:
Abundance (CV)
The most important step for inferring genes’ mutational significance is to properly classify whether the gene is highly mutated relative
to some background mutation rate (BMR), which varies on a macroscopic level across patients and genes and on a microscopic level
across sequence contexts. MutSig accounts for all three of these aspects, renormalizing BMR on a per-gene, -patient, and
-context level.
Clustering (CL)
Genes often harbor mutational hotspots, specific sites that are frequently mutated. While abundance calculations bin mutations on
the gene level, clustering bins mutations on the local site level, which allows MutSig to differentiate between genes with uniformly
distributed mutations and genes with localized hotspots, assigning higher significance to the latter.
Conservation (FN)
MutSig uses evolutionary conservation as a proxy for determining the functional significance of a mutated site. It assumes that ge-
netic sites highly conserved across vertebrates have greater functional significance than weakly conserved sites. MutSig assigns a
higher significance to genes that experience frequent mutations in highly conserved sites.
MuSiC2
MuSiC2 (Dees et al., 2012) version 0.2 is a frequency based tool used to identify significantly mutated genes (https://github.com/
ding-lab/MuSiC2). Significance is determined by comparing a calculated background mutation frequency to a convolution for spe-
cific transition, transversion, and CpG variants. Default parameters were used for initial SMG identification. A recent update to
MuSiC2 provides a long gene filter, which seeks to remove false positives by virtue of finding genes whose elevated mutation tallies
are due primarily to their larger size rather than their mutational significance. Briefly, it systematically tightens the p value threshold for
longer genes (> 5000nt) based on a table test of uncoupling gene status (significant versus not significant) from gene size (long gene
versus typical-size gene).
OncodriveCLUST
OncodriveCLUST (Tamborero et al., 2013a) identifies genes with non-silent mutations that cluster together in protein sequence more
than expected based on a background distribution of synonymous mutations. OncodriveCLUST was run through a local installation
of IntOGen pipeline (available at https://bitbucket.org/intogen/intogen-pipeline). Different minimum mutation thresholds were set
manually, according to the mutation burden of the different cancer types: 3 (in ACC, CHOL, DLBC, ESCA, GBM, KICH, kidney renal
clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), KIRP, LGG, MESO, PAAD, PCPG, PRAD, READ, SARC and THYM), 5 (in BRCA, CESC, COAD, LAML,
LIHC, OV, TGCT, THCA, UCS, UVM and the PANCANCER run), 7 (in HNSC, SKCM and STAD), 10 (in BLCA) and 12 (in LUAD, LUSC
and UCEC). Next, we applied a custom expression filter in each cancer type by filtering out genes whose median expression level was
lower than 6 log2 RSEM in that particular cancer type. Genes were found significant at a q-value threshold of 0.05.
OncodriveFML
OncodriveFML (Mularoni et al., 2016) identifies genes that have greater accumulation of mutations that have higher predicted func-
tion impact (functional impact bias). The predicted impacts of mutations were scored using CADD (Kircher et al., 2014). The mean
CADD score for mutations was compared to permuted mutations within the same gene to calculate an empirical p value. The results
have been calculated considering all the observed mutations in CDS regions. CDS regions were extracted from Gencode release 19
(https://www.gencodegenes.org/releases/19.html). The annotations include all CDS where both the ‘‘gene_type’’ and the ‘‘tran-
script_type’’ were tagged as ‘‘protein_coding.’’ The analysis was performed using OncodriveFML version 1.0.2-alpha with the coding
indels option specified. The configuration file contained the default parameters with the following exceptions (https://bitbucket.org/
bbglab/oncodrivefml/downloads/PanCanAtlas.conf). Genes were deemed significant at a q-value of 0.25.
ActiveDriver
ActiveDriver detects genes that are enriched in somatic mutations located in post-translationally modified sites, such as phosphor-
ylation, acetylation, or ubiquitination sites. It identifies driver genes using a logistic regression that takes into account, among other
factors, the position of the PTM sites and the distribution of the mutations (Reimand and Bader, 2013). ActiveDriver (v0.010, default
parameter) was run using the database ActiveDriver_HG38. Due to high mean log fold change (MLFC) values, genes were deemed
significant at a q-value of 0.0001.
e-Driver
This algorithm identifies protein regions that are enriched in somatic missense mutations using a binomial test and assuming muta-
tions are distributed randomly across the protein. The protein regions can be linear (Porta-Pardo and Godzik, 2014) or three-dimen-
sional (Porta-Pardo et al., 2015). The current analysis uses PFAM domains (Finn et al., 2016) and disordered regions predicted by
Foldindex (Prilusky et al., 2005) for the linear analysis. We used the regions described in https://github.com/eduardporta/e-Driver/.

 CompositeDriver
We have developed CompositeDriver v0.1 (https://github.com/khuranalab/CompositeDriver), a novel computational method consid-
ering both mutation recurrence and functional impact of mutations to identify signals of positive selection. For all mutations within a
gene’s protein coding region, a composite score was calculated through summation of mutation recurrence multiplied by the func-
tional impact score (Jagadeesh et al., 2016). For each gene, a p value was computed by testing whether the observed composite
score is significantly higher than the null distribution. To build the null distribution from the background, the same numbers of mutated
positions were repeatedly drawn (default is 105 times) from other protein coding regions of similar replication timing and similar mu-
tation context (Alexandrov et al., 2013). The Benjamini-Hochberg method for multiple hypothesis correction and q value cut-off of
0.05 was used.
Population-based sequence algorithms
VEST
VEST (Variant Effect Scoring Tool) is a machine learning method that predicts the functional significance of missense mutations
observed through genome sequencing, allowing mutations to be prioritized in subsequent functional studies based on the probability
that they impair protein activity (Carter et al., 2013; Douville et al., 2016). VEST version 3.0 scores were retrieved from the CRAVAT
web server (v4.3) (Douville et al., 2013).
MutationAssessor
MutationAssessor (Reva et al., 2011) uses residue conservation across species to identify the impact of non-synonymous mutations.
Scores were obtained using the precompiled database ljb26_all from ANNOVAR v20150322 (Wang et al., 2010).
PolyPhen2
Polymorphism Phenotyping v2 (PolyPhen2) (Adzhubei et al., 2013) is a machine learning approach that computes the functional
impact of missense mutations. The method uses sequence-based and structure-based features to train a naive Bayes classifier.
Scores were obtained using the precompiled database ljb26_all from ANNOVAR (Wang et al., 2010).
SIFT
Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant (SIFT) SIFT (Ng and Henikoff, 2002) predicts the functional impact of missense mutations using
sequence homology. Scores were obtained using the precompiled database ljb26_all from ANNOVAR v20150322 (Wang
et al., 2010).
Cancer-focused algorithms
CHASM
CHASM (Cancer-specific High-throughput Annotation of Somatic Mutations) is a machine learning method that predicts the func-
tional significance of somatic missense mutations observed in the genomes of cancer cells, allowing mutations to be prioritized in
subsequent functional studies, based on the probability that they give the cells a selective survival advantage (Carter et al., 2009).
CHASM scores (precompute version 3.0) were retrieved from the CRAVAT web server (v4.3) (Douville et al., 2013).
CanDrA
CanDrA (Mao et al., 2013) is a machine learning program that predicts cancer-type specific driver missense mutations based on 96
structural, evolutionary and gene features computed by over 10 other functional prediction algorithms such as CHASM, SIFT, and
MutationAssessor. CanDrA used COSMIC, TCGA, and CCLE data for training and is heavily optimized to perform cancer-type spe-
cific driver mutation analysis (Chen et al., 2016). If a mutation appeared more than once, the maximum CanDrA score was taken. In
this work, the CanDra ‘‘plus’’ version was run under default parameters using the ‘‘general’’ cancer type database.
fathmm
Functional Analysis Through Hidden Markov Models (fathmm) (Shihab et al., 2013) uses Hidden Markov modeling to represent the
protein domain shared across human proteins and to estimate the functional impact of mutations. Using cancer-associated polymor-
phisms from CanProVar and putative neutral polymorphisms from UniProt, fathmm prioritizes mutations that are associated with
cancer versus those that simply impact the function of a protein. Scores were obtained using the precompiled database FATHMM
cancer v2.3 (http://fathmm.biocompute.org.uk/database/fathmm.v2.3.SQL.gz).
transFIC
Transformed Functional Impact score for Cancer (transFIC) (Gonzalez-Perez et al., 2012) assesses the functional impact of tumor
non-synonymous SNVs by accounting for baseline tolerance of functional variants in relation to genes. This is performed by grouping
genes by ontologies and assessing the tolerance of gene sets using functional scores provided by SIFT, PolyPhen2, and
MutationAssessor. By transforming scores based specific ontologies in cancer datasets, modified transFIC scores outperformed
original scores generated by other cancer specific tools. transFIC (v1.0, default parameters) was run using the gosmf database
and applied to MutationAssessor predictions.
Structure-based algorithms
HotMAPS
Hotspot Missense mutation Areas in Protein Structures (HotMAPS) (Tokheim et al., 2016a) detects somatic mutation hotspot regions
in 3D protein structures residing within a single protein chain or spanning protein chains (https://github.com/KarchinLab/HotMAPS;
Cell 173, 371–385.e1–e9, April 5, 2018
e8
 v1.1.3). Protein structures were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and homology models from the ModPipe human 2013
dataset (ftp://salilab.org/databases/modbase/projects/genomes/H_sapiens/2013/), built with Modeler 9.11 (Pieper et al., 2011).
Missense mutations were mapped to each protein structure or homology model using the MySQL database of Mutation position
imaging toolbox (MuPIT) (Niknafs et al., 2013). The preferred biological assembly from MuPIT was used when multiple biological as-
semblies were available for a protein structure. HotMAPS calculates a p value for missense mutated residues containing a higher than
expected density of missense mutations. Multiple hypothesis testing correction was performed using the Benjamini-Hochberg
approach, and the significance threshold was set at a q-value of 0.01.
HotSpot3D
HotSpot3D (Niu et al., 2016) is a suite of algorithms (https://github.com/ding-lab/hotspot3d) that identifies spatial mutation clusters
on 3D protein structures. For this manuscript, we used version 1.4.1. A pairwise distance measure is calculated for nearest-atoms/
average-amino-acid on protein structure. Networks are then built by properly linking pairwise distances to corresponding mutations.
Initialized by the distance matrix of the edges, clusters are constructed using the Floyd–Warshall shortest-paths algorithm to obtain
the geodesics. We weighted this algorithm to bias centroid sections toward frequently mutated missense mutations. Finally, a close-
ness-centrality measure, or the sum of centralities over each mutation in a cluster, was used to describe features in the genes we
identified here. For this study we used the following cutoffs: For intra-molecular clusters: 1) no linear amino-acid chain distance cutoff
was enforced, 2) pairwise distances were calculated using the average amino-acid structure difference, 3) only mutation pairs with
protein specific p values less than 0.05, and 4) the maximum network radius was 10 Angstroms. For inter-molecular clusters: 1) no
linear amino-acid chain distance cutoff was enforced, 2) pairwise distances were calculated using the average amino-acid structure
difference, 3) only mutation pairs with protein specific p values less than 0.05, and 4) the maximum network radius was 20 Angstroms.
3DHotSpots.org
The algorithm behind 3DHotspots.org identifies statistically significant clusters of missense cancer mutations in 3D structures (Gao
et al., 2017). Missense mutations were mapped to 3D protein structures using G2S web services (https://g2s.genomenexus.org/)
(March 2017). Only alignments with a sequence identity of 90% or above were included. The contact map of each structure chain
was then calculated. Two residues with any pair of atoms within 5A
˚ were considered in contact. A 3D cluster is defined by a central
residue and at least one contact neighbor residue. A 3D cluster is identified as significantly mutated if its residues were more
frequently mutated than expected by chance, as determined by a permutation-based test. Details of the methodology and the
tool are available at https://github.com/knowledgesystems/mutationhotspots. Version 1.0.1 with default parameters was used in
this analysis.
e-Driver3D
This algorithm identifies protein regions that are enriched in somatic missense mutations using a binomial test and assuming muta-
tions are distributed randomly across the protein. The three-dimensional analysis is based on a library of protein interaction interfaces
extracted from the Protein Data Bank30. The interaction interfaces are defined for each pair of protein chains in each PDB coordi-
nates file as all the residues of a chain with a carbon atom within 5 A
˚ of a carbon atom of the other chain. We used the interfaces
described in https://github.com/eduardporta/e-Driver/interfaces_human_genome.txt.
Additional algorithms
DriverNET
DriverNet (Bashashati et al., 2012) is a package to predict functional important driver genes in cancer by integrating genome data
(non-synonymous SNVs, indels, and copy number alteration) and transcriptome data (gene expression data). The different data types
are integrated using an influence graph (Wu et al., 2010). We ran DriverNet (v1.6.0, numberOfRandomTests = 500, weight = FALSE,
purturbGraph = FALSE, purturbData = TRUE) and genes with q-value of 0.05 were deemed significant.
OncoIMPACT
OncoIMPACT (Bertrand et al., 2015) is a model-driven approach to integrate omics profiles (genomics and transcriptomics) and pro-
vides patient-specific cancer driver gene predictions. It uses a gene interaction network to associate mutations (non-synonymous
SNVs, indels and copy number alterations) with transcriptomic changes (Wu et al., 2010). We measured the transcriptomic change
of each patient as the log2 fold change of the patient gene expression value with the cancer type median gene expression value.
OncoIMPACT (v0.9.4) was run using default parameters. The top 50 predicted genes were used for the consensus gene list building.
MSIsensor
Written in C++, MSIsensor (version 0.2) is an algorithm that distinguishes microsatellite instable (MSI) tumors from microsatellite sta-
ble (MSS) samples based on tumor/normal sequence data (Niu et al., 2014). Homopolymer regions of 5 or more nucleotides in length
are aggregated separately in tumor/normal pairs and compared using a c2 statistic. MSI-high was calculated as an MSI score R 4.
Parameters for running MSIsensor ‘‘msi’’ command are as follows: –l (minimal homopolymer size) = 1 and –q (minimal microsatellite
size) = 1. These settings are not minimal number of repeats, but rather the minimal number of nucleotides to consider within the
repeat.

 Figure S2. Consensus Gene Scores and SMG Filtering, Related to Figures 1 and 2
(A) Left, outlier detection was performed on a per analysis and method basis. Outliers were marked (red) based on the quasi-majority of three criteria: (1) low
concordance with known cancer genes from Vogelstein et al. (lower than median); (2) high divergence of p value distribution from theoretical expectation (higher
than median); and (3) abnormally high number of significant genes (> 1.5x the interquartile range above the third quartile). The first two criteria were assessed
based on the other tools within a single analysis, while the third criterion was assessed based on the same tool’s results over all the individual cancer types
(excluding the PanCancer analysis). Right, example calculation of the gene consensus score for ARID1A in the cancer type LIHC. A result from an outlier is down
weighted, receiving a weight of 0.5 instead of 1.0. The gene consensus score is the sum of weights for tools finding that gene as significant.
(B) Overlap of consensus gene list with prior TCGA marker papers.
(C) Likely false positives were detected with a high Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) score threshold representing 90% sensitivity for keeping associations found
in Cancer Gene Census genes. LDA was trained to distinguish common false positives in exome sequencing from previous TCGA PanCancer marker papers. The
LDA threshold was only applied to the potential source of false positive genes.

(A) Predictive power of each individual driver gene detection method (in gray) and of the weighted and weighted scores (in orange). The predictive power was
measured as prAUC, using all the genes in the Cancer Gene Census and a set that additionally excludes Cancer Genome Landscape genes used in outlier
detection. Error bars, calculated by bootstrapping, indicate one standard deviation.
(legend continued on next page)
 (B) The number of consensus genes in each cancer type positively correlated with the average mutation burden. Shaded area indicates 95% bootstrapped
confidence interval.
(C) Given the variability in powered effect size (fraction of mutated samples above background with 90% power) in this study, there is a negative but not significant
correlation with the number of consensus genes in each cancer type. COAD and rectum adenocarcinoma (READ) were excluded because analysis was per-
formed separately, but the final consensus genes were merged.
(D) Pearson correlation between the number driver genes identified and median purity was calculated and plotted.
(E) Pearson correlation between the number driver genes identified and mean purity was calculated and plotted. Summary statistics for p value and r-squared
value are reported in the top right corner of panels (D) and (E).
(F) Percent of samples containing a non-silent mutation stratified by cancer type. The red line indicates the median across cancer types (left) and average number
of non-silent mutations in consensus genes per sample (right).
(G) Pie chart showing percent of consensus genes which are found in the Cancer Gene Census with annotations for small somatic mutations (missense, splice
site, indel, and nonsense).
(H) Consensus genes showed a higher probability for loss-of-function intolerance and missense mutation constraint of germline mutations based on ExAC (Lek
et al., 2016) and were expressed (RPKM > 1) in a wider number of tissues from GTeX (version 6) (Consortium, 2015). Given the high correlation of gene expression
in the 11 brain regions assessed from GTEx, we took the median of multiple brain tissues, as done in Lek et al. (2016).
Boxplots indicate median MSI score with 25th and 75th percentile hinges and whiskers that extend to 1.5*IQR.

Figure S4. Molecular Properties of Cancer Driver Genes, Related to Figure 2
(A) Hierarchical clustering of the gene consensus scores for genes that were found in more than one cancer type. The correlation distance metric and average
linkage was used. Each gene cluster was tested for enrichment in three groups of cancer types, in order: Pan-squamous (BLCA, CESC, LUSC, HNSC, and ESCA),
Pan-gynecological (UCEC, UCS, CESC, OV, and BRCA), and Pan-gastrointestinal (STAD, COADREAD, ESCA, and PAAD). Significant gene clusters are based on
a permutation test assessing the total gene consensus score (10,000 iterations) and are progressively colored gray (not significant), blue (Adjusted p < 0.05), green
(Adjusted p < 0.01), and red (Adjusted p < 0.001). P values were multiple test corrected across all genes using the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR method. Gene
clusters are shown as distinct colors in the first column of the row annotation bar. Clusters of genes were defined based on cutting the dendrogram at a depth
chosen by manual inspection.
(B) Percentage of consensus genes predicted as either oncogene (brown), tumor suppressor gene (green), or unknown (gray) by the 20/20+ algorithm, an
improved version of the 20/20 rule (Vogelstein et al., 2013). The 20/20+ algorithm uses a supervised-learning approach (random forests) and bases predictions on
the mutational patterns observed within a gene. ‘‘Likely’’ and ‘‘Possible’’ statuses were determined at a threshold of 0.05 for q-value (Benjamini-Hochberg
method) and p value, respectively. Consensus genes were designated as ‘‘Unknown’’ if they did not meet these thresholds. N represents the number of significant
genes in each cancer type.

Figure S5. Characteristics and Implementation of Driver Mutation Analysis, Related to Figure 3
(A–E) Eight sequence-based tools scored missense mutations to prioritize likely driver mutations over passenger mutations. (A) The absolute Spearman cor-
relation between different sequence-based tools is shown, where tools are arranged in order by hierarchical clustering using a Euclidean distance metric. Tools
that distinguish pathogenic missense mutations from neutral polymorphisms are labeled ‘‘population-based’’ (red), while tools focused on distinguishing pas-
senger somatic missense mutations from cancer drivers are colored blue. A consensus score (named (C)ombined (T)ool (A)djusted (T)otal—CTAT) for the
‘‘population-based’’ tools and ‘‘cancer-focused’’ tools was developed. (B) Receiver operator curves (ROC) compared CTAT-population and CTAT-cancer scores
to 8 sequence-based tools. We used OncoKB annotation of ‘‘Oncogenic’’ and ‘‘Likely Oncogenic’’ versus all other missense mutations in consensus genes as a
benchmark. Area under the curve (AUC) calculations are presented for each of the individual 8 sequence-based tools and two sequence-based consensus
approaches. (C) We determined the optimal score threshold based on balanced accuracy (red dashed line) for CTAT-population (left) and CTAT-cancer (right).
Missense mutation hotspots were also detected based on four structural tools that utilize three-dimensional protein structures. (D) The percentage of missense
mutations labeled as ‘‘Oncogenic’’ or ‘‘Likely Oncogenic’’ in OncoKB steadily increased with greater number of structural tools, indicating an amino acid residue
was a hotspot. (E) Fraction of unique missense mutations in this study either in or not in the OncoKB, which is stratified by the number of mutation-level ap-
proaches in agreement (Population-based, Cancer-focused, and Structural clustering). The gray line separates where mutations were found in our consensus
gene list (not found, manually rescued, or official).

Figure S7. On-Label/Off-Label Calculations for Druggable Mutations in Cancer, Related to Figure 6
Missense mutations from consensus gene calling were annotated using the DEPO database. Here the proportion of samples in a cancer type (x axis) with on-label
(blue) or off-label (red) therapeutic options are provided for specific missense mutations (y axis). Briefly, on-label refers to mutation specific treatments that have
been clinically tested for a given cancer type. Off-label designations refer to potential drug therapies not heavily tested for said cancer types. Only druggable
mutations present in the largest number of tumor samples across the TCGA cohort are displayed.
