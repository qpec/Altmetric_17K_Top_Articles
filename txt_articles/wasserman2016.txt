1. A yellow fever outbreak emerges in Africa
11 
Q4 
On January 22, 2016, the internet-based disease outbreak
12 
reporting system of the International Society for Infectious
13 
Diseases – ProMED – posted an alert
Q5 
of 23 cases of yellow fever
14 
(YF) amongst locals, as well as Congolese and Eritreans, in a heavily
15 
populated suburb of Luanda, the Angolan capital.1 This was
16 
based on an official Angolan Ministry of Health announcement.
17 
Three days later, the number of suspected cases had grown to
18 
99 (26 confirmed), including eight deaths. On January 29, ProMED
19 
reported additional cases in southern Huila Province nearly
20 
1000 km from Luanda.2 Over the following weeks, a major urban
21 
YF epidemic unfolded in Angola, and by April 10, a total of
22 
1751 suspected cases (582 laboratory-confirmed) with 242 deaths
23 
had 
been 
reported. 
The 
outbreak 
is 
widespread, 
involving
24 
59 districts in 12 of the 18 provinces in the country, including
25 
the capital Luanda, which has recorded 406 confirmed cases. Three
26 
confirmed cases in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo
27
have been connected with the Angolan outbreak,3 and infected
28
travellers have been reported in Kenya.4
29
Of major concern, the first YF cases have been reported in Asia,
30
occurring 
in 
infected 
travellers 
from 
Angola. 
By 
April 
10,
31
10 laboratory-confirmed cases had been imported into China,
32
including six in Fujian Province, an area where dengue transmis-
33
sion has occurred.5 With a large expatriate Chinese community in
34
Angola, it is likely that additional undetected cases may have been
35
imported. If ongoing introduction of cases occurs in areas with a
36
high density of the urban YF mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti, it is
37
possible that local transmission could occur in China and
38
potentially spread to Southeast Asia.
39
Approximately two billion people live in A. aegypti-infested
40
countries in Asia. The prospect of a YF introduction into this
41
unvaccinated population poses a major global health threat. In this
42
review, the potential for a YF outbreak in Asia is discussed in the
43
context of the ecological and historical forces that have shaped
44
global YF epidemiology. The aim is to draw attention to this
45
emerging epidemic and to provide impetus for the necessary
46
public health response.

There is currently an emerging outbreak of yellow fever in Angola. Cases in infected travellers have been
reported in a number of other African countries, as well as in China, representing the first ever
documented cases of yellow fever in Asia. There is a large Chinese workforce in Angola, many of whom
may be unvaccinated, increasing the risk of ongoing importation of yellow fever into Asia via busy
commercial airline routes. Large parts of the region are hyperendemic for the related Flavivirus dengue
and are widely infested by Aedes aegypti, the primary mosquito vector of urban yellow fever
transmission. The combination of sustained introduction of viraemic travellers, an ecology conducive to
local transmission, and an unimmunized population raises the possibility of a yellow fever epidemic in
Asia. This represents a major global health threat, particularly in the context of a depleted emergency
vaccine stockpile and untested surveillance systems in the region. In this review, the potential for a
yellow fever outbreak in Asia is discussed with reference to the ecological and historical forces that have
shaped global yellow fever epidemiology. The limitations of surveillance and vector control in the region
are highlighted, and priorities for outbreak preparedness and response are suggested

2. The ecology and clinical manifestations of yellow fever
55 
YF is a viral haemorrhagic fever transmitted by mosquitoes. The
56 
YF virus (YFV) is the prototype virus of the family Flaviviridae, a
57 
group that includes the epidemic arthropod-borne viruses causing
58 
dengue, Japanese encephalitis (JE), and Zika, amongst others. YF is
59 
enzootic in rainforests of Africa and South America, and is
60 
maintained in sylvatic transmission cycles between monkeys
61 
and arboreal mosquitoes. Sporadic human infection can occur after
62 
intrusion into this ‘jungle cycle’ through occupational or recrea-
63 
tional exposure to infected mosquitoes, resulting in single cases or
64 
limited sylvatic outbreaks. In South America, this may spill over
65 
into nearby towns to enter an inter-human urban cycle. In the wet
66 
African savannah, where mosquito vectors reach high densities in
67 
the rainy season and overlap with areas of human activity, there is
68 
intense enzootic transmission with increased risk of human
69 
infection. Inter-human transmission that occurs as a result of
70 
these epizootics is usually self-limited, but can lead to the
71 
emergence of rural epidemics. This is known as the intermediate
72 
cycle, or ‘zone of emergence,’ because extension of an epizootic
73 
into dry savannah areas with larger human and domestic vector
74 
populations may establish an urban epidemic cycle that can lead to
75 
explosive outbreaks.
76 
A. aegypti is the vector for urban YF epidemics in both Africa and
77 
South America, and is also the main vector for dengue and Zika
78 
virus transmission. It is exquisitely well-adapted for this purpose:
79 
A. aegypti breeds in man-made containers of water, feeds
80 
predominantly on human blood and bites multiple individuals
81 
in a single blood meal, lives in close association with human
82 
dwellings, and efficiently transmits YFV in its saliva.
83 
The clinical manifestations of YF range from asymptomatic
84 
infection to multi-organ failure and death. Most infections are
85 
asymptomatic. Most symptomatic cases experience a self-limiting
86 
febrile illness associated with myalgia, back pain, and prostration.
87 
The fever, which lasts about 4 days, is accompanied by high levels
88 
of viraemia, increasing the risk for mosquito infection during a
89 
blood meal.6 Approximately 15–25% of infected individuals enter
90 
a ‘period of intoxication’ after a brief remission of fever. This is a
91 
multisystem disease dominated by hepato-renal failure, profound
92 
jaundice, and a bleeding diathesis. Death occurs in 20–50% of these
93 
cases.6 This is a much higher mortality than dengue, which causes
94 
death in 5% of patients, and as low as 1% in settings with experience
95 
in dengue management.7 Morbidity in survivors is substantial,
96 
with a prolonged convalescent phase characterized by weakness
97 
and fatigue.
98 
3. Epidemiology
99 
YFV almost certainly originated in Africa.8 Its initial spread to
100 
Central 
and 
South 
America, 
along 
with A. 
aegypti, 
was 
a
101 
consequence of the trans-Atlantic slave trade.9–12 The appalling
102 
conditions on slave ships supported an intense and sustained
103 
introduction of YFV into the Americas: hundreds of thousands of
104 
West Africans were transported together with domesticated A.
105 
aegypti mosquitoes, which presumably set up breeding and
106 
transmission cycles during the long voyages,13 delivering a critical
107 
mass of viraemic hosts and vectors into a receptive environment.
108 
This allowed for the establishment of enzootic YF in the forests
109 
surrounding slave ports and its rapid dissemination throughout
110 
the continent to become the most important epidemic disease in
111 
the region for three centuries.14 Yellow fever epidemics had
112
significant impact as far north as Philadelphia in the 18th century.
113
The conditions for YF introduction into the Americas are not
114
dissimilar to the current scenario in Angola, where thousands of
115
foreign workers are rapidly transported via air to Asian cities that
116
have dense infestations of A. aegypti vectors and unvaccinated
117
populations.
118
Epidemic YF in the Americas was successfully controlled in the
119
mid 20th century through mass vaccination and vector reduction
120
programmes.14,15 However, sporadic cases and small, limited
121
outbreaks continue to occur, associated with forest exposure.16
122
After a major resurgence in the region in the late 20th century,17
123
there now appears to be a downward trend of reported cases.18
124
Between 1985 and 2012, there were an estimated 4066 reported
125
cases and 2351 deaths from YF (58% case fatality rate) in the
126
Americas. Failure to sustain vector control and vaccination
127
programmes has led to the reinvasion of A. aegypti across large
128
swaths of the Americas, as evidenced by ongoing chikungunya and
129
Zika outbreaks. If sufficient YF cases occur in cities to facilitate
130
urban transmission, we may yet see YF epidemics again in the
131
Americas.
132
In Africa, YF continues to place an enormous burden on
133
communities living in endemic areas. Between 1980 and 2012,
134
150 yellow fever outbreaks in 26 African countries were reported
135
to the WHO, and over 90% of the estimated 200 000 annual global
136
cases occur on the continent. However, field studies suggest that
137
the actual number of cases may be 10 to 500 times higher.19,20 This
138
is supported by a recent modelling study, which showed that YF
139
may infect up to 1.8 million individuals in Africa annually,
140
resulting in 180 000 (95% confidence interval 51 000–380 000)
141
cases and 78 000 (95% confidence interval 19 000–180 000)
142
deaths;21 this accounts for 0.8% of all-cause mortality in endemic
143
regions, and up to 3% in West Africa where most cases occur.21
144
Although complete eradication of YF is not possible due to the
145
sylvatic reservoir, significant progress has been made with the
146
introduction of YF vaccine into routine child immunization
147
programmes.22 Mass vaccination has led to a 27% reduction in
148
overall annual burden and a 57% reduction in cases in targeted
149
countries.21 However, according to WHO and United Nations
150
Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) estimates, only 41% of the
151
target population had received YF vaccination in 2014,23 well
152
below the recommended 80% threshold for the prevention of an
153
epidemic. In Angola, the YF vaccine coverage of 77% in 2014
154
(dropping to 70% in 2015), has clearly been inadequate to prevent
155
the current outbreak.
156
4. Re-emergence of yellow fever in the Americas and Africa:
157
implications for Asia
158
In dengue-endemic areas, the basic reproduction numbers (R0)
159
of YF and dengue are closely connected, suggesting that the
160
introduction of a single YF-infected individual has the potential to
161
trigger an urban YF epidemic.24 This has been a concern in South
162
American countries where there has been a reinvasion by A. aegypti
163
in most large cities.16,25,26 Although the last urban YF outbreak in
164
South America occurred in 1942 in Brazil, further cases of spill-over
165
with documented urban transmission have been reported in
166
Bolivia27 and Paraguay.28 Both of these outbreaks were limited in
167
space and time: in Paraguay, a rapid national response with mass
168
vaccinations and surveillance terminated the outbreak.29
169
A similar situation exists in Africa, where there are regular large
170
epidemics involving partially immune populations living at the
171
forest–urban interface. This occurs mainly in West Africa, but even
172
Kenya has experienced a recent large sylvatic outbreak.30 During
173
urban epidemics in Africa, the incidence of infection is as high as
174
20%. Up to 40% of the affected population demonstrate serological
175
evidence of recent YF infection, which may reflect partial

 176 
immunity from prior vaccination or infection.31 This incidence
177 
highlights the devastating potential of a YF introduction into a
178 
completely non-immune population.
179 
With increasing volumes of air travel, the international spread
180 
of emerging and vector-borne infections has become a substantial
181 
risk.29 This risk is particularly acute in the Asia-Pacific region,
182 
where systems for YF surveillance and detection are largely
183 
untested, and YF vaccination is limited to travellers.14,16 The
184 
volume of south-to-south travel – between Asia and South
185 
America, or between Asia and Africa – has been less well-
186 
documented. This has now become an important consideration, as
187 
underscored by the chikungunya and Zika experience. For YF,
188 
Africa, with over 90% of global YF cases, is the most likely source for
189 
YF importations into Asia. The 10 YF cases reported in China
190 
suggests that not all travellers were effectively vaccinated despite
191 
Chinese public health regulations. The current confluence of a
192 
significant urban YF outbreak in Angola together with a large
193 
expatriate Chinese workforce (estimated at 20 000) with subopti-
194 
mal vaccination levels may provide the ideal ecological conditions
195 
for the introduction and urbanization of YFV in China and other
196 
Asian countries. These reports of imported cases from Angola in
197 
China therefore need to be taken extremely seriously.
198 
5. Barriers to yellow fever introduction into Asia
199 
Despite an abundance of people, monkeys, and A. aegypti
200 
throughout tropical and subtropical latitudes, yellow fever virus
201 
has not previously been reported in Asia. In contrast, dengue virus
202 
has established an urban transmission cycle in large populations in
203 
the region, where it is now hyperendemic with major public health
204 
and economic impacts. The failure of YF to become established in
205 
the Asia-Pacific is unexpected, given the closely shared disease
206 
ecology with dengue. The actual epidemiological difference
207 
suggests that local factors in the Asia-Pacific have prevented YF
208 
from gaining a foothold in the region, and may provide some
209 
reassurance that there are sufficient barriers to prevent the
210 
establishment of YF in the Asia-Pacific.
211 
Urban outbreaks of YF are much less common in East Africa, and
212 
are associated with enzootic YFV genotypes transmitted by
213 
sylvatic mosquito vectors, rather than A. aegypti.32 This suggests
214 
that the East African A. aegypti mosquitoes are less favourable
215 
vectors for human disease and may therefore have limited
216 
adaptation to human environments, reducing the possibilities
217 
for survival during the long trade crossings by boat to Asia
218 
historically.33 Phylogenetic data suggest that A. aegypti may
219 
eventually have reached Asia from the West, and not via the East
220 
African trade route, and Asia thus probably became infested with A.
221 
aegypti later than the Americas.32,33
222 
Additionally, there is some evidence of geographical variation
223 
in A. aegypti susceptibility to YF,34 raising the possibility that Asian
224 
strains may be less competent YF vectors.8,26 Notwithstanding the
225 
above limitations, there may have been importations of YF into
226 
Asia after its widespread infestation with A. aegypti, potentially
227 
during the large African epidemics in Sudan,35 Ethiopia,36 and
228 
Kenya.30 But, these would have involved few cases from isolated
229 
rural and remote regions amongst populations unlikely to travel by
230 
commercial airlines, and thus had a low potential for sustained or
231 
transcontinental 
transmission.6,8,26,37
Together 
with 
delayed
232 
historical introduction, this low risk of importation of viraemic
233 
YF individuals to Asia has been the dominant explanation for the
234 
absence of the disease in the region. However, it is less compelling
235 
in the contemporary context of a large outbreak in a major urban
236 
centre such as Luanda with direct flight connections to Aedes-
237 
infested cities in Asia.
238 
The delayed and limited introduction of YF into Asia may have
239 
left open an ecological niche for the establishment and dominance
240
of dengue and other flaviviruses in the region through the native
241
Aedes albopictus, and later the well-adapted A. aegypti mosquito.
242
This may have impacted on the ecology of YF in Asia in two key
243
ways. First, dengue virus may out-compete YFV within A. aegypti,37
244
either preventing co-infection or reducing infectiousness by
245
induction of a latently infected state.38,39 Second, the high
246
population seroprevalence of dengue and JE in Asia may provide
247
cross-protective immunity and act as a barrier to the establish-
248
ment of YF.6
249
In strong support of this hypothesis, experimental animals with
250
previous heterologous flavivirus exposure experience lower levels
251
of viraemia and less severe disease when challenged with YFV.40,41
252
Thus, although the presence of heterotypic flavivirus antibody does
253
not lower the risk of infection, dengue-immune individuals who
254
become infected with YF may be less likely to transmit YF to
255
mosquitoes. Using a mathematical transmission model, Amaku
256
and colleagues showed that YF prevalence is strongly affected by
257
cross-immunity, and that this best accounted for the absence of YF
258
in Asia compared with other competing hypotheses.42 This raises
259
the possibility that areas that are endemic but not hyperendemic
260
for dengue, such as southern China or Hong Kong and Singapore,
261
may be vulnerable to YF outbreaks, as the level of dengue and JE
262
immunity in the population may not be as complete as in other
263
parts of Southeast Asia. However, these findings do not explain the
264
presence of both dengue and urban YF in Africa, suggesting that
265
additional factors may have a role in the failure of YF to become a
266
dominant flavivirus in Asia.
267
These other factors may relate to the YFV itself and its
268
transmission dynamics. YF has lower peak viral loads compared to
269
dengue,25 limiting its transmission potential in dengue-endemic
270
environments. And unlike dengue, YF has maintained is sylvatic
271
character. Urban transmission is thus always initiated by spill-over
272
from the jungle or savannah,26 and consequently may have a lower
273
risk of occurring in urban centres in Asia. The higher mortality of YF
274
may further limit its introduction and persistence in an urban cycle
275
and allow dengue to dominate in Asia.
276
A virological explanation for the lower frequency of YF
277
outbreaks in East Africa, and its absence in Asia, may be the
278
observed regional differences in YF viral genotypes,43 which
279
potentially influence virulence phenotypes in humans and non-
280
human primates.31,32 The genetic differences between geographic
281
strains of A. aegypti influence its competence as a YF vector,44 and it
282
has been suggested that this also contributes to a lower YF
283
transmission risk in Asia.8,14,26 Finally, although it is possible that
284
humans and non-human primates in Asia have a lower genetic
285
susceptibility to YF, this has never been demonstrated.
286
6. Factors conducive to yellow fever entry into Asia
287
In the face of the above limitations, there is a modern precedent
288
for large-scale introduction of other Aedes-borne viral infections
289
into receptive populations. In 2004, a Kenyan outbreak of the
290
alphavirus chikungunya (CHIKV) spread via the India Ocean basin
291
to India and Southeast Asia, leading to an explosive epidemic
292
involving millions of people from populations with historical
293
CHIKV exposure.45 The same epidemic strain, which is spread by A.
294
aegypti,46 is causing an ongoing chikungunya epidemic in the
295
Americas, and has already led to 39 000 infections this year. The
296
WHO has recently declared a Public Health Emergency of
297
International Concern in response to the Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak
298
in the same region. Like YFV, ZIKV is a flavivirus that originated in
299
Africa and is mainly transmitted by A. aegypti. It entered South
300
America via the Pacific in 2014, and has rapidly spread to infect
301
over a million people, with autochthonous cases reported from
302
26 countries47,48 by early April 2016. The Zika and chikungunya
303
epidemics provide powerful counterpoints to the most important

dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2016.04.025
 304 
putative limitations for YF introduction into Asia, namely that a
305 
shared vector and prior population exposure do not necessarily
306 
constrain the entry of a new arbovirus into dengue-endemic
307 
regions.
308 
In the particular case of YF there are a number of other
309 
contemporary factors that, when taken together, represent the ideal
310 
conditions for an Asian epidemic. These are summarized in
311 
Table 1. First, and perhaps the most critical, is the volume of
312 
travellers entering the region on commercial airlines. This allows for
313 
the introduction of symptomatic individuals during the period of
314 
maximal viraemia, as well as those incubating the virus or
315 
asymptomatically infected, raising the potential for transmission
316 
to mosquito vectors. The Asia-Pacific region will represent the
317 
largest regional market for air transport in 2016,49 accounting for a
318 
third of global passengers. Even a limited YF outbreak in China could
319 
therefore rapidly disseminate to the higher risk regions of India or
320 
Southeast Asia though air travel. Second, the ongoing importation of
321 
YF-infected individuals into China in April 2016 is nearing the peak
322 
period of dengue transmission, starting in July.5 The very high vector
323 
densities during this time may overcome other barriers to YF
324 
urbanization, including the theoretical possibility that Asian strains
325 
of A. aegypti are less competent than their African counterparts.50
326 
Third, there appears to be low effective vaccination coverage of
327 
Chinese workers in Angola. The risk of illness for an unimmunized
328 
person spending 2 weeks in an area of epidemic activity has been
329 
estimated at one in 267,51 translating into a substantial number of
330 
potential cases amongst returning workers, with the consequence of
331 
sustained regional YF exposure. Finally, there is a strong possibility
332 
that widespread epidemic transmission could occur in Asia before it
333 
is recognized.16 This is related to the difficulty in YF diagnosis due to
334 
serological cross-reactivity with prevalent flaviviruses such as
335 
dengue and JE, and a similar clinical presentation to other endemic
336 
diseases such leptospirosis, typhoid fever, rickettsiosis, malaria, and
337 
viral hepatitis.
338 
Using the successful introduction and threats of re-emergence
339 
of YF in South America as a historical model, there appear to be four
340 
main conditions that need to be fulfilled to support YF introduction
341 
into a new population: (1) sufficient migratory flow of viraemic
342 
individuals from YF-endemic/epidemic areas (i.e., intense and
343 
sustained introduction), (2) a high density of competent vectors in
344 
receptive ecological conditions, (3) a susceptible or partially
345
susceptible human and monkey population, and (4) inadequate
346
surveillance with delayed recognition leading to ineffective
347
vaccination programmes. Current conditions in many parts of
348
Asia therefore appear to be favourable for the introduction of YF
349
and the establishment of a transmission cycle in the region12
350
(Figure 1). In this context, the occurrence of YF cases from the
351
Angolan outbreak imported to China creates a situation primed for
352
an Asian epidemic, and demands an adequate response.
353
7. Responses to prevent yellow fever introduction into Asia
354
Actions in Central and South America in the early 20th century
355
demonstrated that urban YF epidemics can be successfully
356
prevented and controlled. As with other arboviruses, the tenets
357
underlying YF prevention are surveillance, vaccination, and vector
358
control. This should be coupled with the development of systems
359
that can support a rapid outbreak response. These include
360
strengthening 
laboratory 
capacity, 
the 
ability 
to 
carry 
out
361
epidemiological and entomological investigations, and emergency
362
measures to interrupt transmission, such as mass vaccination,
363
destruction of urban mosquito breeding sites, education about
364
mosquito avoidance, use of ovitraps, and domiciliary residual
365
spraying.56–59
366
The extent and nature of A. aegypti infestation in Asia prohibits
367
the use of vector elimination as a feasible short-term intervention
368
for outbreak prevention,59 and so the urgent focus needs to be on
369
coordinated programmes of surveillance and vaccination of
370
travellers. Unfortunately, the high proportion of asymptomatic
371
infections and the non-specific nature of the mild clinical disease
372
limit the usefulness of passive surveillance to detect YF introduc-
373
tion into a new population. In the event of an outbreak in Asia, even
374
active case finding will be challenging in the context of overlapping
375
clinical presentation with other endemic infections and the
376
limitations in diagnostic tests described above. To mitigate these
377
limitations, 
governments 
could 
consider 
enforcing 
a 
7-day
378
quarantine for returning travellers from endemic countries
379
without YF vaccination certificates. Most countries in the Asia-
380
Pacific require proof of YF vaccination for travellers arriving from
381
countries with a risk of YF transmission,60 and this clearly needs to
382
be more strictly enforced after the importation of YF-infected
383
travellers to China. In response to this, the WHO has recommended
Table 1
Factors supporting the introduction of yellow fever into Asia
Risk factor 
Comments
Favourable local ecology 
Abundance of the primary mosquito vector, high human population density,
and forested areas with monkey hosts. This will support both an enzootic cycle
and urban transmission.
Large numbers of returning travellers from an active outbreak in Angola 
There are an estimated 20 000 Chinese workers in Angola, plus many from other
Asian countries, including India. This could support sustained, high volume YF
introduction into Asia.
High volumes of passenger air travel between an active epidemic and China,
and with other Asian countries
Air travel allows the introduction into China of viraemic cases or of people
incubating YF, and facilitates subsequent dissemination within Asia.
Possibly low vaccine coverage of Chinese workers 
Unimmunized travellers increase the risk of infection and subsequent
importation.
Importation of cases during Aedes aegypti breeding season, starting July 
This will coincide with peak vector densities, increasing the risk for local
transmission.
YF cases imported into dengue-endemic areas 
Six cases have been reported from Fujian Province, where the local transmission
of dengue occurs with high Aedes aegypti concentrations.
Difficulty in recognition of imported cases 
Overlapping clinical presentation with other endemic infections and cross-
reactivity of YF serology with other endemic flaviviruses may delay the
recognition of an incipient epidemic.
Inadequate vaccine stocks 
The current vaccine supply would not support a full outbreak response in Asia.
Poor surveillance structures 
Asian laboratories are not geared for YF detection, airport screening is not
sufficiently sensitive for passive surveillance (misses cases in the incubation
period, fever masked by antipyretics), and there are limited numbers of travel
medicine experts.63

 384 
the reinforcement of vaccination requirements in China, and the
385 
Chinese government has deployed teams to Angola to provide
386 
vaccination to its citizens there. However, there is a delay of
387 
10 days until the development of protective immunity after
388 
vaccination, and surveillance for imported cases in Asia should be
389 
ongoing. Unofficial disease reporting systems, such as ProMED, are
390 
becoming increasingly useful for the early detection and commu-
391 
nication of new cases in emerging outbreaks, and have an
392 
important role in raising situational awareness.
393 
The most powerful tool in YF control is vaccination. Mass
394 
vaccination campaigns are extremely effective at reducing the YF
395 
burden in populations with low immunity, both in the prevention
396 
of 
enzootic 
spill-over 
and 
in 
the 
rapid 
control 
of 
urban
397 
epidemics.14,17,21 As of April 10, the Angolan government, together
398 
with international partners, has administered 5.9 million doses of
399 
YF vaccine in the Luanda province (accounting for 90% of the
400 
population); preparations for mass vaccination in Huambo and
401 
Benguela provinces are underway. However, the global emergency
402 
YF vaccine stockpile is depleted, and there is currently not enough
403 
vaccine to cover Angola’s population. The production of new
404 
vaccine using the current method of embryonated chicken eggs is
405 
slow and limits capabilities to rapidly produce large vaccine
406 
quantities in response to an outbreak. It is therefore highly unlikely
407 
that sufficient YF doses would be available for an effective
408 
emergency YF outbreak response in Asia, further emphasizing the
409 
vulnerability of the situation. Much lower doses of YF vaccine are
410 
likely to be as effective as the currently used full-dose vaccine,61
411 
and it has been suggested that a fifth of the current dose should be
412 
administered to expand vaccine stockpiles in the context of the
413 
global threat posed by the current outbreak.62 This should be
414 
considered seriously and implemented as a matter of urgency.
415 
8. Conclusions
416 
There is no single factor that accounts for the absence of YF in
417 
Asia, and it is likely that a complex combination of virological,
418
environmental, and social processes have shaped the current
419
global epidemiology of YF restricting the disease to Africa and the
420
Americas. The current scenario of a YF outbreak in Angola, where
421
there is a large community of non-immune foreign nationals,
422
coupled with high volumes of air travel to an environment
423
conducive to transmission in Asia, is unprecedented in history.
424
These conditions raise the alarming possibility of a YF epidemic,
425
with a case fatality of up to 50%, in a region with a susceptible
426
population of two billion people and where there is extremely
427
limited infrastructure to respond effectively. The growing number
428
of imported cases in China shows how critical it is to recognize this
429
risk now in order to take adequate pre-emptive action so that a
430
global catastrophe can be averted.
