Abstract
Background: Familial prostate cancer risk estimates are inflated by clinically insignificant low-risk cancer, diagnosed after
prostate-specific antigen testing. We provide age-specific probabilities of non-low- and high-risk prostate cancer.
Methods: Fifty-one thousand, eight hundred ninety-seven brothers of 32 807 men with prostate cancer were identified in
Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden (PCBaSe). Nelson-Aalen estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated
for cumulative, family history–stratified probabilities of any, non-low- (any of Gleason score � 7, prostate-specific antigen
[PSA] � 10 ng/mL, T3-4, N1, and/or M1) and high-risk prostate cancer (Gleason score � 8 and/or T3-4 and/or PSA � 20 ng/mL
and/or N1 and/or M1).
Results: The population probability of any prostate cancer was 4.8% (95% CI ¼ 4.8% to 4.9%) at age 65 years and 12.9% (95%
CI ¼ 12.8% to 12.9%) at age 75 years, of non-low-risk prostate cancer 2.8% (95% CI ¼ 2.7% to 2.8%) at age 65 years and 8.9% (95%
CI ¼ 8.8% to 8.9%) at age 75 years, and of high-risk prostate cancer 1.4% (95% CI ¼ 1.3% to 1.4%) at age 65 years and 5.2% (95%
CI ¼ 5.1% to 5.2%) at age 75 years. For men with one affected brother, probabilities of any prostate cancer were 14.9% (95%
CI ¼ 14.1% to 15.8%) at age 65 years and 30.3% (95% CI ¼ 29.3% to 31.3%) at age 75 years, of non-low-risk prostate cancer 7.3%
(95% CI ¼ 6.7% to 7.9%) at age 65 years and 18.8% (95% CI ¼ 17.9% to 19.6%) at age 75 years, and of high-risk prostate cancer
3.0% (95% CI ¼ 2.6% to 3.4%) at age 65 years and 8.9% (95% CI ¼ 8.2% to 9.5%) at age 75 years. Probabilities were higher for men
with a stronger family history. For example, men with two affected brothers had a 13.6% (95% CI ¼ 9.9% to 17.6 %) probability
of high-risk cancer at age 75 years.
Conclusions: The age-specific probabilities of non-low- and high-risk cancer presented here are more informative than rela-
tive risks of any prostate cancer and more suitable to use for counseling men with a family history of prostate cancer.
American and European clinical guidelines recommend men
with a family history of prostate cancer to obtain prostate-
specific antigen (PSA) testing from age 40 to 50 years (1,2). The
recommendations are based on epidemiological studies show-
ing a two- to five-fold increased relative risk of prostate cancer
for these men (3,4). However, in the present “PSA era,” familial
aggregation of prostate cancer is often caused by increased
diagnostic activity (PSA testing) among relatives of men with a
recently diagnosed prostate cancer, rather than by shared ge-
netic predisposition (5). As a consequence, the magnitude of the
increased prostate cancer risk for men with a family history of
prostate cancer is to a large extent inflated by familial aggrega-
tion of “PSA detected,” clinically insignificant, low-risk prostate
cancer (5,6). The risk estimates presently used for counseling of

 men with a family history of prostate cancer are therefore of
limited value. The clinical significance of a man’s probability of
high-risk, potentially lethal prostate cancer is certainly different
from that of his probability of any (possibly indolent) prostate
cancer. Moreover, current guidelines only include estimates of
relative risks of prostate cancer, despite recommendations that
information on medical risk to lay people should be conveyed
as absolute risks (7,8).
We have previously reported on the heritability of Gleason pat-
terns (6). We now report on a nationwide, population-based regis-
ter study aiming at providing age-specific probabilities of any,
non-low-risk, and high-risk prostate cancer for men with a family
history of prostate cancer and differentiating these probabilities
by the number of affected relatives, the relatives’ ages at diagno-
sis, and the risk category or severity of the relatives’ cancer.
Methods
The Prostate Cancer Data Base Sweden
The Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden (PCBaSe) 3.0 was created
through record linkages between the National Prostate Cancer
Register (NPCR) of Sweden and several other nationwide, popu-
lation-based health care registers and demographic databases.
The NPCR of Sweden captures 98% of the prostate cancer cases
in the Swedish Cancer Registry, to which registration is man-
dated by law (9). PCBaSe has previously been described in detail
(10). The quality and completeness of the NPCR (11), as well as
of other Swedish national registers and databases, are high, and
notifications are regularly reviewed by Statistics Sweden.
Information in PCBaSe on family history was obtained from
the
Multi-Generation
Register,
which
is
held
by
Statistics
Sweden. The register includes family information for all individ-
uals born in Sweden since 1932 and who were still residents in
Sweden after in 1961 or later. In 2007, there were about nine mil-
lion index persons in the register who could be linked to their
first-degree relatives (biological parents, siblings, and children).
Practically all first-degree relatives alive after 1990 are registered.
Figure 1 shows the selection of families for the final study cohort,
which included 51 897 brothers of 32 807 men with prostate can-
cer. Half-brothers of index cases with a common father were in-
cluded (n ¼ 4035), whereas half-brothers with a common mother
were excluded. All brothers whose father was not registered in
the Swedish Cancer Registry as diagnosed with prostate cancer
were included in the analysis of the effect of the father’s prostate
cancer status, including those whose father was still alive, whose
father died young, or for whose father we had no information on
age at or cause of death (<10% of fathers). The PCBaSe project
was approved by the Research Ethics Board at Umea
˚ University.
Definitions of Cancer Risk Categories
Prostate cancer diagnosed among brothers of index cases was
categorized as low risk (T1-2, Gleason score � 6, PSA < 10 ng/
mL, Nx/N0, Mx/M0), non–low risk (any cancer not in the low-
risk category, ie, Gleason score � 7 and/or T3-4 and/or PSA �
10 ng/mL and/or N1 and/or M1), or high risk (any of Gleason
score � 8, T3-4, PSA � 20 ng/mL, N1 and/or M1). Most prostate
cancers among fathers of the index persons were diagnosed be-
fore 1998 and were thus not registered in the NPCR of Sweden.
Therefore, the severity of their cancers was categorized as low
risk, nonlethal, or lethal. Low risk was defined as prostate can-
cer diagnosed before the age of 75 years in men who lived at
least 10 years after their diagnosis, nonlethal cancer as any
prostate cancer diagnosed in a father who did not die from pros-
tate cancer (fathers who died of other causes within 10 years of
their prostate cancer diagnosis were included in this category),
and lethal cancer was any prostate cancer diagnosed in a father
who died from prostate cancer during the time of follow-up.
Statistical Analysis
Nelson-Aalen estimates were used to calculate cumulative
probabilities of prostate cancer with 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) for brothers of the index cases in PCBaSe and for men in
the general population, using age as time scale. The number of
men at risk (the denominator) in the estimates for the general
population was acquired from Statistics Sweden whereas the
denominator in the estimates for the brothers of the index cases
was acquired from PCBaSe. The number of prostate cancer
cases observed among men at risk (the numerator) was ac-
quired from PCBaSe. The probability of prostate cancer was cal-
culated as 1-exp(�Nelson-Aalen estimator) (12). As there were
few men at risk before age 50 years, the precision of probability
estimates before that age would be low. We therefore present
probabilities conditioned on no prostate cancer diagnosed be-
fore age 50 years. The brothers of the index cases were followed
from the date of entry into one of the specific risk categories, as
defined by the dates for new prostate cancer diagnoses in their
family, to the date of their own diagnosis of prostate cancer,

curred first. P values for comparisons between probabilities for
men with different family histories were calculated using the
Wald statistic. A P value of less than .05 was considered statisti-
cally significant, and all statistical tests were two-sided.
Results
For men in the general Swedish population, the probabilities of
any prostate cancer were 4.8% (95% CI ¼ 4.8% to 4.9%) at age 65
years, 12.9% (95% CI ¼ 12.8% to 12.9%) at age 75 years, and 17.1%
(95% CI ¼ 17.0% to 17.2%) at age 80 years; the probabilities of
non-low-risk prostate cancer were 2.8% (95% CI ¼ 2.7% to 2.8%)
at age 65 years, 8.9% (95% CI ¼ 8.8% to 8.9%) at age 75 years, and
12.7% (95% CI ¼ 12.6% to 12.8%) at age 80 years; and the proba-
bilities of high-risk prostate cancer were 1.4% (95% CI ¼ 1.3% to
1.4%) at age 65 years, 5.2% (95% CI ¼ 5.1% to 5.2%) at age 75
years, and 8.2% (95% CI ¼ 8.1% to 8.2%) at age 80 years.
The probabilities of any, non-low-risk, and high-risk prostate
cancer increased with the number of affected family members
and with age. The probabilities at age 65 and 75 years are shown
in Table 1 and displayed graphically in Figures 2-5. For example,
for men with one affected brother, the probabilities of any pros-
tate cancer were 14.9% (95% CI¼ 14.1% to 15.8%) at age 65 years,
30.3% (95% CI ¼ 29.3% to 31.3%) at age 75 years, and 36.1% (95%
CI¼ 34.8% to 37.4%) at age 80 years; the probabilities of non-low-
risk prostate cancer were 7.3% (95% CI¼ 6.7% to 7.9%) at age 65
years, 18.8% (95% CI¼ 17.9% to 19.6%) at age 75 years, and 24.2%
(95% CI¼ 23.0% to 25.5%) at age 80 years; and the probabilities of
high-risk prostate cancer were 3.0% (95% CI¼ 2.6% to 3.4%) at
age 65 years, 8.9% (95% CI ¼ 8.2% to 9.5%) at age 75 years, and
12.7% (95% CI ¼ 11.5% to 13.8%) at age 80 years. Men with two
brothers with prostate cancer had at age 75 years a 55.1% (95%
CI¼ 49.8% to 59.9%) probability of any prostate cancer, a 33.2%
(95% CI ¼ 28.2% to 37.8%) probability of non-low-risk cancer, and
a 13.6% (95% CI¼ 9.9% to 17.6%) probability of high-risk cancer.

 Most men with a family history of prostate cancer had a 30%
to 60% probability of any prostate cancer at age 75 years, but
around half of them were diagnosed with low-risk cancer. Their
probability of high-risk prostate cancer was typically one-sixth
to one-fourth of the probability of any prostate cancer (Table 1).
The relative risks of familial prostate cancer decreased with
age, for example, of any prostate cancer for brothers of men
with prostate cancer from 3.1 (95% CI ¼ 2.9 to 3.3) at age 65 years
to 2.4 (95% CI ¼ 2.3 to 2.4) at age 75 years and to 2.1 (95% CI ¼ 2.0
to 2.2) age 80 years.
For men with a father diagnosed before age 75 years, the
probabilities of non-low-risk and of high-risk cancer at age 65
years were higher than for men with a father diagnosed after
age 75 years (P ¼ .005 and P ¼ .05) (Table 1 and Figure 4). We did
not analyze the effect of the age at diagnosis of an affected
brother because the age at diagnosis for affected brothers
covaries as they are likely to be of similar age. For example,
brothers of men diagnosed in their fifties are younger and
therefore at risk of being diagnosed in their fifties or sixties
whereas most brothers of men diagnosed with prostate cancer
at age 75 years are in their seventies (had these brothers been
diagnosed in their fifties or sixties, they would have been the in-
dex case the family). Neither the brothers’ nor the fathers’ can-
cer’s

significantly
affected
the
probability of any, non-low- or high-risk disease (Table 1).
Discussion
We present, for the first time, age-specific probabilities of non-
low- and high-risk prostate cancer for men with a family history
of prostate cancer. Most of these men had a 30% to 60%

 probability of any prostate cancer at age 75 years, but around
half of the diagnosed cancers were in the low-risk category and
of little clinical significance. The men’s probability of high-risk
prostate cancer was much lower, typically one-sixth to one-
fourth of the probability of any prostate cancer. For example,
men with two brothers with prostate cancer had at age 75 years
a 55.1% probability of any prostate cancer, a 33.2% probability of
non-low-risk cancer, and a 14.6% probability of high-risk cancer.
Clearly, the probabilities of non-low-risk and, in particular,
high-risk cancer are highly relevant when counseling men with
familial prostate cancer. We suggest that these probabilities are
included in future clinical guidelines.
In agreement with the results from our previous studies on
familial prostate cancer (5,6), the present study indicates that
PSA testing leads to an “inflation” of familial prostate cancer
risks. Only 2.0% of men in the general population were diag-
nosed with low-risk cancer at age 65 years, compared with 7.6%
of men with one affected brother and 20.1% of men with two af-
fected brothers. These absolute differences are much larger
than
the
corresponding
differences
for
high-risk
cancer.
Because low-risk prostate cancer almost always is diagnosed af-
ter PSA testing, our results strongly suggest that PSA testing is
more common among men with than in men without a family
history of prostate cancer.
Almost all previous studies of familial prostate cancer have
reported relative risk estimates (relative risks, rate ratios, haz-
ard ratios, or standard incidence ratios). The notion of a relative
risk may be difficult to grasp, and absolute risks are therefore
recommended for clinical counseling (7,8). The age-specific
probabilities provided by our study are in essence absolute risks
and will be useful for clinicians who discuss the risk of familial
prostate cancer with their patients. Experts in risk communica-
tion recommend visualization of absolute risks in the form of
pictograms (7,8). We therefore provide two pairs of pictograms
as examples of how our results may be presented to laypeople
(Figure 5).
The probability of high-risk prostate cancer was affected by
the number of affected family members and by the severity of
the prostate cancer diagnosed in a father, but not by the broth-
er’s cancer’s risk category: The probability of a future high-risk
prostate cancer for brothers of men with a low-risk cancer was
only slightly lower than for brothers of men with a high-risk
cancer. This is a clinically important finding; brothers of men
diagnosed with a low-risk prostate cancer should not be recom-
mended against PSA testing just because their brother’s cancer
might have been considered clinically insignificant.
We have previously shown that brothers of men with
Gleason score 8-10 cancer are at a particularly high relative risk
of cancer with the same Gleason score (6). The proportion of
brother pairs concordant for Gleason score 8-10 cancer in that
study was, however, small. This means that the effect size of
Gleason score 8-10 cancer heritability on the absolute probabil-
ity reported in the present study is small and compatible with
the only slightly higher probability of high-risk cancer among
brothers of men with high-risk cancer.
Our study shows that relative risks of familial prostate can-
cer decrease with age. The relative risk of any prostate cancer
for brothers of men with prostate cancer was 3.1 at age 65 years,
which is exactly the same as reported in a meta-analysis of 16
studies (3), but decreased to 2.4 at age 75 years and to 2.1 at age
80 years. This is in agreement with a previous study that re-
ported absolute risks of prostate cancer for men with and with-
out a family history of the disease (13). Therefore, relative risk
estimates derived from studies on younger men should not be
multiplied with the lifetime risk in the population to achieve an
estimate of the absolute lifetime risk.
Strengths of our study include the use of nationwide,
population-based, high-quality register data with almost com-
plete capture rates (10,11). The statistical precision of our calcu-
lations was therefore high. The narrow confidence intervals
should not, however, be confused with high external validity.
The incidences of any and high-risk prostate cancer vary geo-
graphically; the incidence of low-risk prostate cancer also
changes over time because of varying diagnostic activity (PSA
testing). The reported probabilities of any prostate cancer
should be regarded as approximations of the probabilities for
men only in populations with a high prostate cancer incidence
and a high uptake of PSA testing, such as in North America,
Australia, New Zealand, and north-western Europe. The inci-
dence of high-risk prostate cancer is not much affected by PSA
testing, so the reported probabilities of high-risk disease are ap-
plicable also for men in populations with a high incidence and a
low uptake of PSA testing, such as in the Caribbean and in some
parts of Africa. Moreover, despite the inclusion of more than
50000 men at risk in total, the number of men at risk before age
55 years was low in many of the subgroups. The confidence

 intervals of the probabilities shown in the figures for men youn-
ger than 55 years are therefore wider than the ones shown for
men at age 65 years in Table 1.
Another limitation is that the sons of men registered in
PCBaSe were too young to allow analysis of their cancer risk;
only probabilities for the index men’s brothers were analyzed.
The risk of prostate cancer for men whose father is the only af-
fected family member is lower than the risk for men with an af-
fected brother (3). A meta-analysis reported risk ratios of 2.4 for
sons and of 3.1 for brothers of men with prostate cancer (3).
We had detailed, complete information on cancer character-
istics at the time of diagnosis for the index cases’ brothers. No
such detailed information was available to categorize the sever-
ity of the fathers’ cancers. The ad hoc nature of the criteria for
these categories may have contributed to the lack of association
between the fathers’ and their sons’ cancer risk categories.
Moreover, the categorization of the brothers’ cancers was based
on the diagnostic prostate biopsies only. As some men diag-
nosed with low-risk cancer have an undetected prostate cancer
of higher grade, the tendency for aggressive prostate cancer to
run in families may be stronger than suggested by our results.
To summarize, we used nationwide, population-based registers
to calculate age-specific probabilities of any, non-low-risk, and
high-risk prostate cancer for men with and without a known fam-
ily history of prostate cancer. The probabilities of high-risk prostate
cancer were substantially lower than of any prostate cancer. As
the probability of any prostate cancer in populations with wide-
spread PSA testing is inflated by clinically insignificant cancer, the
probabilities of non-low- and high-risk prostate cancer are more
appropriate for counseling men with a family history of prostate
cancer. We suggest that age-specific probabilities of non-low- and
high-risk cancer are incorporated in future clinical guidelines.
