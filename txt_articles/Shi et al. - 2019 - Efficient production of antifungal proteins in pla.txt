Summary
Fungi that infect plants, animals or humans pose a serious threat to human health and food
security. Antifungal proteins (AFPs) secreted by filamentous fungi are promising biomolecules
that could be used to develop new antifungal therapies in medicine and agriculture. They are
small highly stable proteins with specific potent activity against fungal pathogens. However, their
exploitation requires efficient, sustainable and safe production systems. Here, we report the
development of an easy-to-use, open access viral vector based on Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV).
This new system allows the fast and efficient assembly of the open reading frames of interest in
small intermediate entry plasmids using the Gibson reaction. The manipulated TMV
fragments are then transferred to the infectious clone by a second Gibson assembly reaction.
Recombinant proteins are produced by agroinoculating plant leaves with the resulting infectious
clones. Using this simple viral vector, we have efficiently produced two different AFPs in
Nicotiana benthamiana leaves, namely the Aspergillus giganteus AFP and the Penicillium
digitatum AfpB. We obtained high protein yields by targeting these bioactive small proteins to
the apoplastic space of plant cells. However, when AFPs were targeted to intracellular
compartments, we observed toxic effects in the host plants and undetectable levels of protein.
We also demonstrate that this production system renders AFPs fully active against target
pathogens, and that crude plant extracellular fluids containing the AfpB can protect tomato
plants from Botrytis cinerea infection, thus supporting the idea that plants are suitable
biofactories to bring these antifungal proteins to the market.
Introduction
Disease-causing fungi that infect plants, animals and humans
pose a serious threat to human and animal health, food security
and ecosystem resilience (Fisher et al., 2016, 2012). More people
die every year from fungal infections than from malaria (Bon-
gomin et al., 2017). Fungal infections can have fatal conse-
quences for at-risk immunocompromised patients with HIV/AIDS,
anti-cancer chemotherapies, corticosteroid therapies, and organ
transplantation, among others (Campoy and Adrio, 2017). In
addition, fungi are a challenge to food security because they
destroy major crops globally and contaminate food and feed with
mycotoxins that are detrimental to animal and human health
(Bebber and Gurr, 2015). Only a few classes of antifungal agents
are available today, and even these are not fully effective due to
the development of resistance, host toxicity, and undesirable side
effects (Perfect, 2016). There is thus an urgent need to develop
novel antifungals, whose properties and mechanisms of action
represent improvements on the existing ones, and which can be
applied in diverse fields, including crop and postharvest protec-
tion, preservation in cosmetics, materials and food, and animal
and human health.
Antifungal proteins (AFPs) produced by filamentous fungi are a
specific class of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Antifungal pro-
teins are promising biomolecules that could be used to develop
new antifungal therapies in medicine and agriculture (Garrigues
et al., 2017; Huber et al., 2018; L�
opez-Garc�
ıa et al., 2012;
Meyer, 2008). AFPs are small proteins, usually cationic, that are
rich in cysteine residues, and are folded in compact structures
supported by disulphide bridges, which make them highly stable
and resistant to heat, proteases and extreme pH (Batta et al.,
2009;
Campos-Olivas
et al.,
1995;
Garrigues
et al.,
2017;
Heged€
us and Marx, 2013). They exhibit potent specific antifungal
activity at very low concentrations against important human and
plant fungal pathogens (Garrigues et al., 2017; Huber et al.,
2018; Marx et al., 2008; T�
oth et al., 2016; Vila et al., 2001;
Vir�
agh et al., 2014), and do not have toxic effects on plant or
mammalian cells (Moreno et al., 2006; Szappanos et al., 2006).
However, the exploitation of AFPs requires efficient, sustainable
and safe production systems. Antifungal proteins have been
biotechnologically produced in Pichia pastori at relatively low
yield, and more efficiently in filamentous fungi using a Penicillium
chrysogenum-based expression cassette (Garrigues et al., 2018;
Huber et al., 2018; L�
opez-Garc�
ıa et al., 2010; Sonderegger et al.,
2016; T�
oth et al., 2018; Vir�
agh et al., 2014). Plants represent also
a good option for producing AFPs that are cysteine-rich proteins
that require disulphide bridges formation and proper folding for
activity. Moreover, previous reports indicate that plants can
sustain AFP production (Coca et al., 2004;
Girgi et al., 2006;
Moreno et al., 2005; Oldach et al., 2001). These reports show
that AFPs can be heterologously produced in plants, leading to
improve resistance to fungal pathogens.

 Plants are excellent biofactories for producing proteins and
other metabolites of interest for research, pharma and industry.
They are fueled by sunlight, are free from human pathogens, and
compared to other systems, production can be scaled up easily.
Many biotechnological tools have been developed for molecular
farming, and those derived from plant viruses are prominent
among them (Hefferon, 2017). Higher plants host a remarkable
diversity of viruses with different genomes and strategies for
genome replication and expression. However, they all have small
genomes, and thus have limited capacity to harbor genetic
information. Despite this limitation, plant viruses can complete
complex and tightly regulated infectious processes in their host
plants. Definitively, evolution has favored small and simple, but
still powerful, genetic elements in plant virus genomes, a wealthy
source of parts for plant biotechnology and synthetic biology.
A pioneering example of a plant virus transformed into a
biotechnological tool is Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). This is a plus
strand RNA virus of genus Tobamovirus, within the family
Virgaviridae (Ishibashi and Ishikawa, 2016; Knapp and Lewan-
dowski, 2001; Scholthof, 2004). The genomic RNA is encapsi-
dated by 2130 units of the viral coat protein (CP) into rigid, helical
rod-shape virions of about 18 nm diameter, and 300-310 nm
length. TMV RNA encodes four proteins: two 50-end proximal
overlapping 126 and 183 kDa replication proteins that are
alternatively produced through a ribosomal readthrough mech-
anism, the 30 kDa movement protein (MP), and the 30-end
proximal 17.5 kDa CP. The two replication proteins are expressed
from the genomic RNA, while the MP and CP are expressed from
30 co-terminal subgenomic RNAs. The TMV genome also contains
50- and 30-untranslated regions that are important for virus
translation and replication (Chujo et al., 2015).
A key property of TMV is the rapid accumulation of large
amounts of the viral CP in infected plant tissues. A combination of
knowledge and a trial-and-error approach led to the construction
of TMV-derived vectors (Dawson, 2014) such as TB-2 (Donson
et al., 1991; Kearney et al., 1993), or 30B (Shivprasad et al.,
1999), which allow to express a foreign open reading frame (ORF)
under the control of the viral CP promoter; in these cases,
encapsidation is achieved by inserting into the recombinant virus
an ORF encoding the CP of a different tobamovirus. Other vectors
such as the TMV RNA-based overexpression (TRBO) vector, in
which most of the viral CP is replaced by the ORF of interest,
produce large amounts of recombinant proteins but are incapable
of spreading systemically (Lindbo, 2007). Improvements in TMV-
based vectors have also focused on increasing the efficiency of
establishing the infection foci and of cloning the genes of
interest. One of the most popular systems uses DNA modules
delivered by Agrobacterium tumefaciens and assembled in vivo by
a site-specific recombinase to produce the TMV-derived vector
(Marillonnet et al., 2004). This de-constructed system was further
improved by introducing silent nucleotide substitutions and
multiple introns into the TMV coding sequences, in order to
increase infectivity (Marillonnet et al., 2005). Another improved
series of TMV-derived vectors uses Gateway cloning to facilitate
insertion of the recombinant ORFs, which can also be fused to a
broad series of epitope tags and fluorescent proteins (Kagale
et al., 2012).
Here, we report the development of a new TMV-derived vector
system that allows quick and easy cloning of the ORFs of interest
using the Gibson assembly reaction (Gibson et al., 2009). We
describe how we have used this system to produce large amounts
of AFPs in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. We show that it is
important to target these bioactive proteins to the extracellular
space, since their toxic effects prevent them from accumulating in
intracellular compartments. Moreover, by accumulating the AFPs
in the extracellular fluids, downstream purification is simpler. We
show also that the recombinant AFPs produced by the new
system have exactly the same activity as their native counterparts
of fungal origin. Finally, we demonstrate that plant extracellular
fluids containing the Penicillium digitatum AfpB can protect
tomato plants from the grey mold disease caused by Botrytis
cinerea.
Results
A new TMV-based vector system in which ORFs of
interest are inserted using the Gibson assembly reaction
As a first step toward a new TMV-derived vector system for plant
biotechnology that uses the Gibson assembly reaction to insert
the ORFs of interest, we constructed a TMV infectious clone that
efficiently infects plants when delivered by agroinoculation
(pGTMV; Figures S1 and S2; Addgene plasmid # 118755). We
then transferred a fragment of the TMV cDNA containing the
entire CP ORF (from A5431 to T6278) to a minimal cloning
vector. In the resulting plasmid, the TMV cDNA was flanked by
recognition sites for the type-IIS restriction enzyme BsaI. The
plasmid was manipulated to mutagenize the ATG initiation
codon of the TMV CP into AGA (positions 5712-5714), and to
replace most of the CP ORF (from T5757 to T6176) by a linker
consisting of the recognition sites for two unique restriction
enzymes (AgeI and XhoI) and the LacZ blue-white selection
marker. The resulting minimal intermediate plasmid (pMTMVi-N;
Addgene plasmid # 118756) is represented in Figure 1 (upper
part) and its exact sequence in Figure S2. This small plasmid
(2376 bp) allows us to easily and efficiently insert the ORFs of
interest using the Gibson assembly reaction (Gibson et al.,
2009). The option of assembling two or more DNA fragments in
a single reaction allows us to fuse any desired peptide tag or
protein moiety to the recombinant protein of interest. Once the
cDNA for the recombinant protein is inserted into pMTMVi-N,
the manipulated TMV genome fragment can be transferred into
the TMV infectious clone (pGTMV) using a second Gibson
assembly reaction (Figure 1, upper part). This requires that
pGTMV be digested with restriction enzymes NcoI and Pfl23II,
which have unique recognition sites in this plasmid. There are
two options for generating the insert from the pMTMVi-N
derivatives, the easiest being to digest the plasmid with BsaI.
However, if the recombinant cDNA contains BsaI sites, the
manipulated TMV DNA fragment can be produced by poly-
merase chain reaction (PCR) using primers PI and PII (Table S1),
which flank the recognition sites of NcoI and Pfl23II.
In pMTMVi-N derivatives, most of the TMV CP is replaced by
the ORF for the recombinant protein, such that the recombinant
viruses will be unable to move systemically in infected plants. To
obtain recombinant TMV clones that can move within the plant,
we constructed a new minimal intermediate plasmid by transfer-
ring the fragment in the pGTMV from A5431 in TMV cDNA to
G62 in the delta ribozyme cDNA. We again mutagenized the
TMV CP ATG to AGA and replaced most of the TMV CP with the
AgeI-LacZ-XhoI linker, as above. In this case, we replaced the final
30 nt of the TMV genome (from A6366 to the end) with the 30
end of a Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) infectious clone (from
G5537 to the end). This fragment includes the ToMV CP
promoter, CP ORF and 30 UTR, and provides an alternative

 tobamovirus CP to encapsidate the recombinant virus, which
allows it to move systemically (Shivprasad et al., 1999). This
second minimal TMV intermediate plasmid, called pMTMVi-M
(Addgene plasmid # 118757), is shown in Figure 1 (lower part,
full sequence in Figure S2). In pMTMVi-M, the M indicates
movement, whereas the N in pMTMVi-N indicates nonmovement.
The cDNA corresponding to the recombinant protein can be
inserted into the AgeI-XhoI digested plasmid using the Gibson
assembly reaction, as previously described. The manipulated TMV
fragment can also be reintegrated into pGTMV, using the Gibson
assembly reaction with a BsaI-digested insert, although in this
case the destination plasmid (pGTMV) must be digested with NcoI
and CpoI. If the cDNA corresponding to the recombinant protein
contains BsaI sites, the insert can also be produced by PCR using
primers PI and PIII (Table S1), which flank the NcoI and CpoI
recognition sites.
We confirmed that the new TMV vector system performed
correctly by cloning the cDNA of reporter green fluorescent
protein (GFP) into both the pMTMVi-N and pMTMVi-M interme-
diate plasmids, transferring the manipulated TMV fragments to
pGTMV, and infiltrating N. benthamiana plants (Figure S3,
sequences in Figure S4).
Production of the antifungal protein AfpB in leaf
apoplasts of N. benthamiana plants
AfpB is an AFP whose gene was identified in the genome of the
postharvest phytopathogenic fungus P. digitatum but that, unlike
other AFPs, is not naturally produced by the fungus (Garrigues
et al., 2016). In a recent study, P. digitatum was genetically
modified to produce AfpB and was found to be a highly active
antifungal protein, with inhibitory concentrations up to one order
of magnitude lower than other AFPs (Garrigues et al., 2017).
Therefore, there is a great interest in obtaining large amounts of
AfpB, so we assessed this possibility using our new TMV vector
system. We designed two different constructs to target this
protein to two different subcellular compartments, namely
apoplast and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Compartmentalizing
antimicrobial peptides in plant cells is known to favor their
accumulation by protecting them from host proteases and
avoiding their toxic effects on the host cells (Bund�
o et al.,
2014; Coca et al., 2006; Montesinos et al., 2016). To target AfpB
to the apoplast or ER, we added the signal peptide of the tobacco
AP24 protein (XP_009782398.1) to the amino terminus of the
mature AfpB protein (Figure 2a). This signal peptide allows the
protein to enter the secretory pathway toward the extracellular
space. In the second construct, we added an additional KDEL
sequence to the carboxyl terminus of the protein, facilitating
retention inside the ER. We then expressed the corresponding
recombinant viruses (TMVDCP-AfpB and TMVDCP-AfpBKDEL;
Figure S4) in N. benthamiana leaves via infiltration with A. tume-
faciens cultures. We observed that leaves agroinfiltrated with
AfpB constructs were damaged, particularly those with the
construct designed for AfpB accumulation in ER (Figure 2b). In
contrast, leaves agroinfiltrated with a GFP control (TMVDCP-GFP)
showed a healthy green appearance, similar to that of the mock-
agroinfiltrated leaves (Figure 2b). This suggests that the negative
effects might be due to afpB expression rather than to TMVDCP
infection.
To confirm that AfpB was produced in N. benthamiana leaves,
we extracted the apoplastic and total protein content, and

A new viral system for efficient AFP production 1071
 analysed them by SDS-PAGE. Coomassie blue staining showed
the accumulation of a small protein with same apparent
molecular weight to that of the P. digitatum AfpB (6.46 kDa) in
the extracellular fluids (ECFs) of TMVDCP-AfpB agroinfiltrated
leaves, but which was absent in leaves that had been agroinfil-
trated with TMVDCP-GFP (Figure 2c). This protein was immun-
odetected with specific anti-PAFB antibodies by Western blot
analysis (Huber et al., 2018) (Figure 2d), thus demonstrating that
AfpB was produced in N. benthamiana leaves when targeted to
the apoplastic space.
We observed no differential bands in total acid protein
extracts from leaves agroinfiltrated with TMVDCP-AfpBKDEL
and mock inoculated leaves (Figure 2e). In contrast, GFP was
observed clearly in the total protein extracts from TMVDCP-GFP
leaves (Figure 2e). Moreover, Western blot analysis of total acid
protein extracts did not detect AfpB in leaves inoculated with
TMVDCP-AfpBKDEL, although the protein was detected in
TMVDCP-AfpB leaves (Figure 2e). These observations indicate
that AfpB did not accumulate in the ER vesicles of N. ben-
thamiana leaf cells, probably due to toxic effects. By comparing
with the known amounts of AfpB produced by P. digitatum,
we estimated that the accumulation of AfpB in the ECFs was
~225 � 37 lg per gram of N. benthamiana leaves. Thus, the
recombinant protein accounts for more than 60% of the total
ECF protein.
Efficient production of proteins of fungal origin
targeted to different subcellular compartments
Since AfpB was not produced when targeted to the ER, we
assessed the efficiency of the TMV-based expression system using
Figure 2 Production of AfpB in the apoplast of
Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. (a) Schematic

and designed to accumulate AfpB in the apoplast

protein at the N-terminus of the mature AfpB

accumulation also contains the ER-retention signal

see Figure 3) was also run in parallel for
comparative purposes. Molecular weight markers
are shown in kDa on the left.

 a different fungal protein and different subcellular localizations.
We selected a protein of unknown function (UP, unknown
protein) encoded by the genome of P. digitatum (PDIG_23520);
UP is a small, cysteine-rich secreted protein that has no predicted
antifungal activity (Garrigues and Marcos, unpublished observa-
tions). Preliminary experiments showed that this protein was
readily produced when secreted to the apoplast space (Figure 2c).
We prepared three different constructs to target UP to the
apoplast, the ER, or the vacuole (recombinant viruses TMVDCP-
UP, TMVDCP-UPKDEL and TMVDCP-UPVS, respectively; Fig-
ures 3a and S4). The constructs to target UP to the apoplast
and ER were prepared as described for AfpB. The vacuolar
construct carries the same N-terminal signal peptide, which
allows UP to enter the secretory pathway, and also a vacuolar
signal peptide at the carboxyl terminus of the protein (Neuhaus
et al., 1991). Nicotiana benthamiana leaves agroinfiltrated with
these recombinant viruses appeared normal with respect to the
TMVDCP-GFP control (Figure 3b). We observed a protein with the
expected mobility of P. digitatum UP in the ECFs obtained from
TMVDCP-UP-infiltrated leaves (Figure 3c, left panel). As judged
from the intensity of bands stained with Coomassie blue, this
protein achieved a higher level of accumulation than those
reached by AfpB. Moreover, we obtained large amounts of this
unknown protein when using TMVDCP-UPKDEL and TMVDCP-
UPVS, the constructs designed for intracellular accumulation in ER
vesicles or vacuoles (Figure 3c, right panel). These differences
were striking, considering that AfpB was not detected when
targeted to the ER. We estimated that the recombinant protein
accumulated in the ECFs to a concentration of 4.3 � 1.1 mg per
gram of leaf fresh weight. These results demonstrate that the
new TMV-based protein production system is highly efficient, and
allows one to easily target recombinant proteins to different
subcellular compartments.
The AfpB produced in plants is biologically active and
indistinguishable from the produced by P. digitatum
Having established that AfpB can be produced in plants when
targeted to the extracellular space, we then proceeded to its
purification from plant ECFs and to determine its biological
activity. For purification, we subjected ECFs from agroinfiltrated
N. benthamiana
leaves
to
one-step
cation-exchange
chro-
matography. We found that most proteins in the extract,
except for AfpB, were not retained by the cationic column, and
were found in the flow-through (Figure 4a). We then eluted
the retained AfpB from the column as a single peak in
fractions

concentration,
and
detected a single protein band by SDS-PAGE analysis. Next
we compared the antifungal activity of the purified recombi-
nant
AfpB
(AfpB[Nb])
to
that of
the AfpB
produced
by
P. digitatum (AfpB[Pd]). The activity was assayed against the
producer fungus P. digitatum, an economically relevant patho-
gen of citrus fruits against which the fungal protein showed
potent activity (Garrigues et al., 2017). Growth inhibitory assays
at different protein concentrations showed that the recombi-
nant protein produced in biofactory plants had equivalent
activity to the fungal version (Figure 4b). Importantly, the crude
ECFs obtained from infiltrated plant tissues showed antifungal
activity as result of AfpB production, and this activity was
similar
to
that
of
the
purified
AfpB
from
fungal
origin
(Figure 4c). These results indicate that purification to homo-
geneity is not required in order to obtain a good AfpB activity.
TMV-based production of alternative antifungal
proteins in biofactory plants
Finally, we wanted to evaluate the new TMV-based system with
other
antifungal
proteins.
For
this,
we

A new viral system for efficient AFP production 1073
 characterized AFP from Aspergillus giganteus (Campos-Olivas
et al., 1995; Meyer, 2008; Vila et al., 2001). Based on the results
obtained with the AfpB, we decided to directly target AgAFP
accumulation
to
the
apoplastic
space.
We
generated
the
TMVDCP-AgAFP construct containing the sequence encoding
the AP24 secretion signal peptide and the mature AgAFP
(Figure S4). Nicotiana benthamiana leaves infiltrated with this
construct had a similar appearance to the mock infiltrated leaves
and leaves inoculated with the TMVDCP-GFP control (Figure 5a).
We analysed ECFs from N. benthamiana leaves by Western blot
using the specific antibodies against AgAFP, previously described
(Coca et al., 2004), and found that AgAFP accumulated in the
apoplasts of infiltrated leaves (Figure 5b). By comparison to
known amounts of the fungal protein, we estimated the amount
of protein produced to be around 196 � 72 lg per gram of leaf
fresh weight. Moreover, ECFs enriched in AgAFP showed
antifungal activity against P. digitatum (Figure 5c). This activity
seems to be at least one order of magnitude lower than that of
the ECFs containing AfpB (Figure 4c), in agreement with the high
activity reported for AfpB (Garrigues et al., 2017). These results,
obtained with a different AFP, indicate that our TMV-based
system can be considered a general platform for producing
antifungal proteins in biofactory plants.
Optimization of the AfpB production method for scaling
the process
Syringe inoculation of plants is a time-consuming and labor intense
process, and thus not suitable for large-scale production of AFPs.

 We evaluated simple methods for agroinoculation that could
facilitate and speed up the AFP production process. These methods
included vacuum infiltration, which can be done on a large scale
with robotics, and simpler spray applications, as reported previously
(Hahn et al., 2015). To monitor transfection efficiency easily, we
used the construct TMVDCP-GFP to produce GFP that can be
visualized under UV light. In syringe- or vacuum-agroinfiltrated
leaves, we observed a strong and homogeneous distribution of GFP
fluorescence in the leaves at 7 days, while in sprayed leaves we
could distinguish separate GFP foci (Figure 6a, upper panels).
However, these GFP foci enlarged over time and merged at 12 days
(Figure 6a, lower panels). These observations indicate that all three
methods can efficiently produce GFP, although the spray applica-
tion method requires a longer timeframe. We also tested these
methods for AfpB production, and found that ECFs from agroinoc-
ulated leaves showed similar AfpB accumulation at 12 days for all
three methods (Figure 6b). These results indicate that the much
simpler spray application can be implemented for easy and
inexpensive large-scale AfpB production.
Finally, we evaluated the stability of the in planta accumulated
AfpB during storage as dried material, which could allow producers
to uncouple biomass production from processing. Comparing AfpB
accumulation in dried leaves with that in immediately frozen leaves,
we observed that AfpB remains stable at least for 2 months when
stored in dried leaves (Figure 6c). Therefore, AfpB can be manu-
factured in N. benthamiana without the need for immediate
processing, and can be stored in dried leaves.
Protection of tomato plants against Botrytis grey mold
by in planta-produced AfpB
Finally, we assessed the effectiveness of in planta-produced
AfpB in plant protection assays. For that, plant protein extracts
containing AfpB were evaluated against the broad-spectrum
fungal pathogen B. cinerea. This fungus causes gray mold in
plants and fresh fruits and vegetables, and is responsible for
important economic losses (Dean et al., 2012). AfpB produced
by P. digitatum has in vitro inhibitory activity against B. cinerea
with a MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) value of 12.5 lM
(Garrigues et al., 2017). We deposited drops containing fungal
conidia on tomato leaves along with N. benthamiana ECF
containing 10 lM AfpB, as well as, drops with conidia along
with
the same concentration of
pure AfpB
produced
by
P. digitatum, and control drops with conidia along with water
or ECF from GFP producing plants. Where control drops were
deposited, infection symptoms were clearly visible at 4 days
postinoculation (dpi); whereas where drops containing AfpB
were deposited lesions were clearly smaller (Figure 7a). By
quantifying lesion size using image analysis, we observed a
statistically significant decrease in the damaged area in the
presence of AfpB (Figure 7b). These results demonstrate that
AfpB protects against B. cinerea infection, both for crude ECFs
containing AfpB (AfpB[Nb]ECF), and for AfpB purified from
fungal cultures (AfpB[Pd]). Even more interesting, the ECF
extracts containing AfpB showed the same protective efficacy.
Therefore,
depending on
the intended
use for
the AfpB
protein, it may not be necessary to include a downstream
purification process. This would reduce considerably the costs
of production and biotechnological application of this antifun-
gal biomolecule.
Discussion
In this study, we show that N. benthamiana plants are an
excellent biofactory for producing antifungal proteins of fungal
origin when transiently expressed using a TMV-derived vector.
The process we have developed is fast and produces high yields of
antifungal proteins, which, in addition, are bioactive in the crude
ECF, or can be easily purified from crude extracts. Importantly,
the recombinant proteins produced in plants have exactly the
same antifungal activity as their native counterparts purified from

A new viral system for efficient AFP production 1075
 fungi. This is a remarkable result because these small cysteine-rich
proteins have been shown to be difficult to produce in a soluble,
correctly folded conformation in bacterial systems (Kiedzierska
et al., 2008; Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014). They only had been
successfully produced as active proteins in Pichia pastori at
relatively low yields (Garrigues et al., 2017; L�
opez-Garc�
ıa et al.,
2010; Vir�
agh et al., 2014), and at better yields in filamentous
fungi (Garrigues et al., 2017; Huber et al., 2018; Sonderegger
et al., 2016; T�
oth et al., 2018). Although plant and fungal
systems are similar in terms of yield and activity, the transient
production of AFPs in plants represents an attractive alternative as
sustainable bioproduction factories fueled by sunlight and easily
scalable. The developments reported here expand the available
alternatives for the exploitation of antifungal proteins and other
cysteine-rich proteins such as UP, which was produced to
extremely high yields.
To produce these antifungal proteins in plants, we first
developed a new TMV-based vector system. The main reason
for developing another TMV vector was to exploit the Gibson
assembly reaction to insert the ORFs of interest into the viral
genome. The Gibson assembly reaction, which is extremely
efficient for inserting DNA fragments into plasmids, provides
unprecedented yields when assembling several DNA fragments
into a plasmid in a single step, provided these fragments contain
the appropriate overlapping ends (Gibson et al., 2009). This
reaction facilitates the insertion of tags and the fusion of protein
moieties. Moreover, we feel that modular TMV-derived systems
that re-assemble in vivo (Marillonnet et al., 2004, 2005) are
unnecessarily complex, and moreover they are not freely available
to the scientific community. Here, starting with an infectious
clone of a TMV vulgare strain (GenBank accession number
MK087763) and a small, optimized binary vector (Thole et al.,
2007), we constructed the plasmid pGTMV, which mediates the
fast and efficient infection of N. benthamiana plants after
infiltration with transformed A. tumefaciens. Marillonnet et al.
(2005) suggested that plant agroinoculation with TMV is an
inefficient process, attributed to abnormal RNA processing of the
viral genome after transcription in the cellular nucleus, a step that
is certainly alien to the natural TMV replication cycle. However,
our experimental results demonstrate high infectivity, even at low
densities of A. tumefaciens (Figure S5). The low infectivity
previously reported in agroinoculation experiments may have
been due to the use of inefficient genetic elements such as
promoters and ribozymes, or the use of large, unstable binary
plasmids.
Several plant-based systems have been used to produce small
proteins and peptides with antimicrobial activity. While challeng-
ing due to the physicochemical properties and toxicity of many of
these peptides, some of these platforms successfully produce
AMPs. These platforms include leaf chloroplasts (Lee et al., 2011),
rice seeds (Bund�
o et al., 2014; Montesinos et al., 2016, 2017),
barley seeds (Hol�
askov�
a et al., 2018) and hairy roots (Chahardoli
et al., 2018). However, the yields reported when using these
systems were much lower than the AFP yield achieved in
N. benthamiana using the TMV-derived system reported here.
While our estimated yield of AfpB was approximately 250 lg per
gram of fresh N. benthamiana leaf tissue, the reported yields for
Retrocyclin-101 and Protegrin-1 were ~5 and 8 lg/g of tobacco

 respectively (Lee et al., 2011), those for Cecropin A were ~40 lg/
g of rice seeds (Montesinos et al., 2016), those for LL37 were
~0.55 lg/g of barley seeds (Hol�
askov�
a et al., 2018), and those for
Lactoferrin chimera were ~4.8 lg/g of tobacco hairy roots
(Chahardoli et al., 2018). In addition, all of these plant-based
production systems are based on stable transformation, which
makes the process more complex and time consuming. Other
transient expression systems have also been used for AMP
production, although with lower yields than those we achieved
for AFPs (Pati~
no-Rodr�
ıguez et al., 2013; Zeitler et al., 2013).
Zeitler et al. (2013) used a TMV full-length virus strategy, to
produce recombinant linear AMP SP1-1 at a yield of ~25 lg/g of
N. benthamiana leaf tissue, while Pati~
no-Rodr�
ıguez et al. (2013)
used the MagnICON system to produce Protegrin-1 at lower
amounts than for the AFPs, and without providing quantitative
data. In any case, even our yield of 250 lg/g for AfpB is far from
the 4 mg/g achieved for other proteins, such as GFP or the
P. digitatum unknown protein UP, which has no predicted
antimicrobial activity. This highlights the difficulties associated
with producing bioactive peptides in biofactory plants.
Importantly, our results with AfpB show that the subcellular
localization is relevant to achieve high accumulations of bioactive
peptides in plant tissues. AfpB accumulates at high levels when
targeted to the extracellular space, whereas intracellular accu-
mulation is hindered, probably by toxic effects. This observation
was somehow unexpected because AFP has not previously been
found to be toxic in plant cells (Coca et al., 2004; Girgi et al.,
2006; Moreno et al., 2006, 2005; Oldach et al., 2001; Vila et al.,
2001). However, these previous studies used external application
or extracellular localization of AFPs in plant tissues, so it is possible
that AFPs interfere with plant cell functions once inside the cells.
In contrast, the other fungal protein produced in our experiments,
UP, which has no predicted antifungal activity, accumulated to
similarly high intracellular and extracellular levels. These observa-
tions reveal the importance of targeting protein accumulation
depending on the characteristics and activity of the recombinant
protein.
Additionally, apoplastic targeting of AFPs in plant tissues
greatly facilitates their purification. As observed in our work, an
extremely simple purification scheme is required to purify AFPs
from N. benthamiana tissue. ECFs can be obtained easily by
vacuum infiltration of harvested leaves and sieving, yielding highly
AFP-rich solutions, in which more than half of the protein content
is AFPs. Starting with these ECFs, a single chromatographic step is
required to purify these small proteins to homogeneity. Even
better, our results show that ECFs can be used directly as
antifungals with no further purification. Thus, the downstream
processing of recombinant AFPs can be greatly reduced and,
consequently, the overall manufacturing costs.
In addition to leaf infiltration, we have also shown that the TMV-
derived system can be used to produce AFPs by spraying N. ben-
thamiana tissues with A. tumefaciens suspensions. This simplifica-
tion of the inoculation process was previously reported for the
MagnICON system (Hahn et al., 2015), and we have successfully
implemented it for our new TMV-derived system. We demonstrate
that the AFP yields achieved after 12 days by spraying leaves are
similar to those achieved after 7 days by vacuum or syringe
infiltration, although spraying is a much simpler inoculation
strategy. Moreover, we observed that AFPs remain stable in stored
N. benthamiana leaves for at least 2 months at room temperature.
This observation suggests that the AFP production process can be
decoupled from the purification process, and leaves can be
conveniently stored before purification. There are clear advantages
to decoupling these two processes, such as avoiding immediate
processing after harvesting or otherwise freezing the plant mate-
rial, with their associated production costs. These developments
facilitate large-scale production of these proteins in an easy, fast
cost-efficient and safe manner. In our TMV vector, the viral CP is
replaced with the AFP genes, so no virus particles are created, and
therefore there is no risk of viral dissemination in the environment.
Also, the afp genes are not incorporated into the plant genome so
they did not become heritable traits. Nonetheless, industrial
production would require contained greenhouse conditions to
avoid the release of the genetically modified A. tumefaciens strains
and TMV clones. The green AFP manufacturing process developed
here could contribute to bring these proteins into the market for
practical use as antifungals. To support these applications, we also
demonstrated the effectiveness of plant ECF containing AfpB in
protecting tomato plants against Botrytis grey mold. Botrytis
cinerea is one of the top ten fungal phytopathogens, causing
important economic losses due to the broad range of hosts, and
that damage that can occur during the production and posthar-
vesting of vegetables, fruits and flowers (Dean et al., 2012).
Fungicides are the commonly used method for controlling
B. cinerea, and botryticides represent more than 10% of the
world’s fungicide market. This work supports the use of green AfpB
as an environment friendly and sustainable alternative to chemical
fungicides.
Experimental procedures
Plasmid construction
To build pGTMV, pMTMVi-N and pMTMVi-M (Addgene plasmids
# 118755, 118756 and 118757, respectively), PCR amplification
reactions were performed using the Phusion high-fidelity DNA
polymerase (Thermo Scientific) in HF buffer. The Gibson assembly
reactions were performed using the NEBuilder HiFi DNA assembly
master mix (New England Biolabs). The NEBuilder assembly tool
(https://nebuilder.neb.com/; New England Biolabs) was used to
design the primers. Escherichia coli DH5a were electroporated
with the products of the Gibson assembly reaction. The full
sequence of these plasmids, which was confirmed experimentally
by nucleotide sequencing, is shown in Figure S2. To build
plasmids expressing the various recombinant TMV clones used in
this work, the intermediate plasmids pMTMVi-N or pMTMVi-M
were digested with AgeI and XhoI (Thermo Scientific), and the
DNA fragments corresponding to the ORFs of interest were
obtained by PCR and assembled using the Gibson reaction. Next,
the manipulated fragment of the TMV cDNA was excised from
the resulting plasmids by digestion with BsaI (New England
Biolabs), and assembled with the large fragment of pGTMV
digested with NcoI-Pfl23II (pMTMVi-N derivatives) or NcoI-CpoI
(pMTMVi-M derivatives) (Thermo Scientific). The full sequence of
all recombinant viruses is shown in Figure S4.
Agroinoculation of N. benthamiana leaves
Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 carrying the helper plas-
mid
pSoup
(Hellens
et al.,

was
transformed
with
plasmids to express the different TMV recombinant clones.
For plant agroinoculation, overnight cultures of A. tumefaciens
were diluted in induction medium (10 mM MES, 10 mM MgCl2,
200 lM acetosyringone) at the appropriate optical density at
600 nm (OD600), incubated for 3 h at room temperature, and
infiltrated using a needle-less syringe (0.5 OD600) or sprayed on

 the underside of leaves using an aerograph at 2 atmospheres
of pressure (1.0 OD600). Importantly, the surfactant Silwet L-77
(0.1% v/v) needs to be added to the induction medium in the
spray inoculation experiments for the effective agroinoculation.
N. benthamiana plants were grown in the greenhouse at 24 °C
with a 14 h light-10 h dark photoperiod. For the inoculation
experiments, we used plants at the 4- to 5-leaf stage, without
visible flower buds. Unless indicated in the results, leaves were
harvested at 7 dpi or 12 dpi and examined for protein
production. In storage experiments, leaves were dried in an
incubator at 37 °C for 2 months. Plants accumulating the GFP
were photographed at different time points with a Nikon
D7000 digital camera under illumination with a hand-held UV
lamp.
Protein analysis and purification
Protein samples were prepared by freezing agroinfiltrated leaves
in liquid nitrogen and then grinding to a fine power with a mortar
and pestle. Total soluble proteins were obtained in two volumes
of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.2, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM
DTT, 0.1% (w/v) SDS and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Extracts were
clarified by centrifugation at 16000 g for 15 min at 4 °C. Acidic
extraction was used with AFP samples, as these proteins are pH-
stable, and can be selectively extracted at low pH. The acidic
buffer (pH 2.8) contained 84 mM citric acid, 30 mM Na2HPO4,
6 mM ascorbic acid, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. For dried
leaves, total proteins were extracted in 50 mM sodium acetate
(pH 5.5), 100 mM NaCl, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. Apoplastic fluids
were extracted from fresh leaves by vacuum infiltration using
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) buffer supplemented with
0.02% (v/v) Silwet L-77. Protein concentrations were determined
using the Bio-Rad protein assay and bovine serum albumin (BSA)
as standard.
Protein
preparations
were separated in tricine-SDS-PAGE
(16.5%). Gels were stained with Coomassie blue to detect
proteins, or transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran
0.2 lm) to immunodetect proteins, as described previously (Coca
et al., 2004; Garrigues et al., 2017). To detect AfpB, we used
antiserum against P. chrysogenum PAFB, which was kindly
provided by Dr. Florentine Marx (Medical University of Innsbruck,
Austria) (Huber et al., 2018). AFPs were purified to homogeneity
by cationic chromatography using an AKTA Purifier system
equipped with a 5 mL HiTrap SP HP column (GE Healthcare), as
described previously (Garrigues et al., 2017). AfpB from P. dig-
itatum (AfpB[Pd]) was obtained from the genetically modified
strain PDSG3543 and purified from culture supernatants using
the same cationic chromatography (Garrigues et al., 2017).
Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically
at 280 nm in purified fractions, or by comparing the band
intensities to known amounts of purified proteins in complex
protein extracts, such as extracellular fluids. Signal intensities
were quantified using the Quantity Tools Image Lab
TM Software
(Version 5.2.1) included in the ChemiDoc
TM Touch Imaging
System (Bio-Rad). The percentage of the recombinant protein
on the total ECF protein concentration was then calculated. GFP
fluorescence in protein extracts was determined as described
previously (Lindbo, 2007).
Antifungal assays
Growth inhibition assays of the P. digitatum CECT20796 (PHI26)
strain were performed in 96-well microtiter plates, as described
previously
(Garrigues
et al.,
2017).
Purified
proteins
and
apoplastic fluids were dialysed against water and used at the
concentrations indicated in antifungal assays.
Plant protection assays
Botrytis cinerea was kindly provided by Prof. A. Molina (CBGP
collection, Madrid). Tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum cultivar
Marmande, known as the Mediterranean tomato) were cultivated
in growth chambers at 22 °C with a 16 h light-8 h dark
photoperiod. AfpB protection assays against Botrytis cinerea
infection were performed on detached tomato leaves of 3-week-
old plants on 1% (w/v) agar in water containing 2 lg/mL kinetin.
Leaves were locally infected at two points with conidial suspen-
sions (106 conidia/mL) by applying 20 lL drops containing 10 lM
AfpB of purified protein or extracellular fluids. The progression of
symptoms was followed visually. Lesion area was measured by
image analysis using the Fiji ImageJ2 package. We analysed two
infection points on three leaves from three independent plants in
three independent experiments.
