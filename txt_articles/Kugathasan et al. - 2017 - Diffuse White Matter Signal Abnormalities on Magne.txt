Background. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can replicate independently in extravascular compartments such 
as the central nervous system, resulting in either cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) discordance (viral load [VL] in CSF 0.5 log10 copies HIV-1 
RNA greater than plasma VL) or escape (detection of HIV VL >50 copies/mL in CSF in patients with suppressed plasma VL <50 cop-
ies/mL). Both discordance and escape may be associated with neurological symptoms. We explored risk factors for CSF discordance 
and escape in patients presenting with diverse neurological problems.
Methods. HIV-infected adult patients undergoing diagnostic lumbar puncture (LP) at a single center between 2011 and 2015 
were included in the analysis. Clinical and neuroimaging variables associated with CSF discordance/escape were identified using 
multivariate logistic regression.
Results. One hundred forty-six patients with a median age of 45.3 (interquartile range [IQR], 39.6–51.5) years underwent 163 
LPs. Median CD4 count was 430 (IQR, 190–620) cells/µL. Twenty-four (14.7%) LPs in 22 patients showed CSF discordance, of 
which 10 (6.1%) LPs in 9 patients represented CSF escape. In multivariate analysis, both CSF discordance and escape were associated 
with diffuse white matter signal abnormalities (DWMSAs) on cranial magnetic resonance imaging (adjusted odds ratio, 10.3 [95% 
confidence interval {CI}, 2.3–45.0], P = .007 and 56.9 [95% CI, 4.0–882.8], P = .01, respectively). All 7 patients with CSF escape 
(10 LPs) had been diagnosed with HIV >7 years prior to LP, and 6 of 6 patients with resistance data had documented evidence of 
drug-resistant virus in plasma.
Conclusions. Among patients presenting with diverse neurological problems, CSF discordance or escape was observed in 15%, 
with treatment-experienced patients dominating the escape group. DWMSAs in HIV-infected individuals presenting with neurolog-
ical problems should raise suspicion of possible CSF discordance/escape.
Keywords. HIV; viral escape; neurocognitive impairment; CSF; reservoir.
 
There is a growing body of evidence that human immunodefi-
ciency virus (HIV) can continue to replicate in disparate com-
partments during suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART). Up 
to 10% of individuals on ART who are peripherally suppressed 
have detectable HIV RNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [1–5]. 
Reasons for this include intermittent adherence and treatment 
interruption where viral rebound in the plasma may be quicker 
to suppress than in the CSF [3]. There are also data on inade-
quate control in CSF due to regimens of suboptimal potency, for 
example, protease inhibitor (PI) monotherapy, or triple ther-
apy with drug resistance [4, 6–8]. In a significant proportion, 
however, the cause of discordance is unclear and possibilities 
include lower penetration of ART into the central nervous sys-
tem (CNS) with subsequent subtherapeutic CSF drug levels [9].
A clinical penetration effectiveness (CPE) score attempted to 
classify ART penetration into the CNS based on pharmacological 
properties, measurable CSF drug concentrations, and evidence of 
reduction in CSF viral load (VL) or improvement in cognition 
in response to treatment [10]. Rawson et al [1] and Cusini et al

[11] found HIV CSF discordance to be associated with lower CPE 
scores. Canestri et al [4] conducted a retrospective cohort study of 
11 patients with CSF discordance and found that in the majority, 
HIV in CSF had developed resistance mutations. Furthermore, 
neurological symptoms and CSF VL improved upon changing to 
a regimen with a higher CPE score. A more recent prospective 
study by Nightingale et al [2] found that CSF discordance was sig-
nificantly associated with low-level peripheral HIV type 1 (HIV-
1) viremia and nadir CD4 count; no association was observed 
between CSF ART concentration or CPE scores.
Detectable HIV in the CSF is hypothesized to increase the 
risk of neurological syndromes and neurocognitive impairment 
(NCI) [4, 12, 13]. The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study [14] 
found the incidence of HIV dementia among men who have sex 
with men to be 21% between 1990 and 1992, which decreased 
to 10% between 1996 and 1998 following the introduction of 
3-drug combination ART (cART) [14]. An elevated HIV-1 CSF 
VL compared to plasma has been associated with NCI [15] and 
dementia in untreated patients [16]. More recently, the presence 
of HIV in CSF was associated with an inflammatory response 
[17] and low-level peripheral viremia in cART-treated patients 
[17]. Two case series [4, 12] have identified cases of CSF dis-
cordance with neurological symptoms.
Despite an increasing understanding of CSF discordance, 
there are gaps in knowledge, for example, identification of risk 
factors associated with development of CSF discordance and 
an understanding of which patients would benefit from fur-
ther investigation in a clinical setting. In particular, data that 
assess the association between a patient’s neurological present-
ing complaint and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results 
with CSF discordance are lacking, and it is these 2 factors that 
most strongly lead the clinician to perform a lumbar puncture 
(LP). We retrospectively studied a population of HIV-infected 
individuals who underwent an LP for a clinical indication, to 
identify risk factors associated with HIV CSF/plasma discord-
ance and CSF escape.
METHODS
Participants were selected using records from a single labora-
tory serving a population of 3800 HIV-infected individuals in 
2013, the median year of study. By 2015, the number had risen 
to 4500, and 95% of these patients were on ART, with 90% hav-
ing plasma VL <50 copies/mL. The inclusion criteria for the 
study were as follows: (1) adults living with HIV over the age 
of 18 having a clinically indicated LP at Mortimer Marker and 
University College London Hospital; and (2) LP performed 
during the period 27 October 2011 to 9 April 2015. The fol-
lowing LP events were excluded: (1) a repeat LP within 90 days 
of the first; (2) LPs where the plasma HIV VL was measured 
>30 days from the time of the LP, or no plasma VL was meas-
ured; (3) LPs where the MRI was done >90 days from the date 
of the LP.
Using hospital and clinic electronic databases, data were 
collected on the following characteristics: age, sex, HIV VL in 
plasma and CSF at the time of LP (within 30 days), CD4 count 
within 30 days of LP, MRI brain findings within 180 days of 
LP, ART regimen at the time of the LP, CPE scores for the ART 
regimen, and clinical indication for the LP (LP within 30 days of 
clinical assessment) (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).
Indications for LP were grouped into acute neurology, 
chronic symptoms of NCI, and subacute neurological com-
plaint. Acute neurology was defined as new neurological pres-
entation including headaches, confusion, sensory and motor 
signs, and symptoms within 1 month of onset. Chronic symp-
toms of NCI included global cognitive impairment, memory 
impairment, attention difficulties, and cognitive impairment 
with neuropathy, and also included follow-up consultations for 
a previous neurocognitive problem. The subacute neurological 
complaint group included any other neurological presentation 
(Supplementary Table 2).
ART regimens were divided into those containing a nucle-
oside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), a nonnucleoside 
reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), a ritonavir-boosted PI, 
an integrase inhibitor, and/or a CCR5 inhibitor (Supplementary 
Figure 1). CPE scores were calculated using the scoring sys-
tem devised by Letendre and colleagues [10]. Discordance was 
defined as a HIV-1 VL in the CSF compartment that was 0.5 
log10 copies HIV-1 RNA greater than the VL in peripheral blood, 
based on criteria used in similar studies [1, 2]. CSF escape was 
defined by the presence of a detectable CSF HIV VL (>50 copies 
per mL) in patients with an undetectable peripheral blood VL 
(<50 copies per mL).
MRI findings were derived from clinical reports created 
by a specialist neuroradiologist, at the time of the patient’s 
presentation. The neuroradiologist was blinded to whether 
patients met criteria for discordance or escape. MRIs were 
categorized as showing volume loss, diffuse white matter 
signal abnormality (DWMSA), focal white matter lesion 
(FWML), or other abnormalities. DWMSA was further 
graded as subtle or definite on the basis of qualitative infor-
mation provided in the report. Definite DWMSA was defined 
as the presence of white matter changes involving multiple 
regions of both supra- and infratentorial white matter [18]. 
The presence of definite DWMSA was supported by increased 
water diffusivity on the apparent diffusion coefficient map, or 
was reported as consistent with viral encephalitis. DWMSA 
was categorized as subtle if it was described as subtle or ill-de-
fined. Small, focal white matter lesions of presumed vascu-
lar origin were categorized as FWML and were not included 
in the definition of DWMSA. T2-hyperintense white matter 
lesions consistent with progressive multifocal leukoenceph-
alopathy or other opportunistic infections were categorized 
as other MRI abnormalities, as were space-occupying lesions, 
hemorrhage, and infarct.

 MRI Changes and CSF HIV-1 Viral Escape • CID 2017:64 (15 April) • 1061
Statistical analyses were done using Stata software version 
13 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas). Univariate analyses 
were performed to identify factors associated with discordance 
and CNS escape independently. Factors with a P value of <.1 
were included in a multivariable logistic regression. A random- 
effects model was used to control for the effect of clustering as 
some participants underwent multiple LPs during the observa-
tion period. We did not perform statistical analysis for an asso-
ciation between ART regimen and CNS discordance/escape due 
to concerns regarding confounding.
RESULTS
Of 194 LPs performed, 163 LPs from 146 individuals were 
included in the present analysis (Supplementary Figure 2). 
Baseline characteristics of the study population are shown in 
Table 1. Median age was 45.3 (interquartile range [IQR], 39.6–
51.5; range, 25.1–79.2) years. The majority (70.5%) of LPs were 
done in men. Median CD4 cell count at the time of LP was 430 
(IQR, 190–620) cells/µL, with a median nadir CD4 count of 130 
(IQR, 50–260) cells/µL. Of LPs, 80.8% (126/156) were done in 
patients on ART (7 missing) (Table 1). Of these, 39 (30.9%) did 
not have VL < 50 copies/mL in plasma. CSF discordance was 
observed in 24 (15%) of LPs in 22 patients and viral escape in 
CSF observed in 10 LPs (6%) in 9 patients.
More than one-third of patients presented with chronic 
symptoms indicative of NCI. The remaining patients were 
split fairly evenly between acute neurological presentations 
and subacute presentations (Supplementary Table 1). MRI 
reports from 141 records were available and 5 were excluded 
as they were performed >6 months from the date of the LP. 
The median time between MRI and LP was 7 (IQR, 2–42) days. 
Among LPs, 11.9% (18/151) were done in the context of focal 
neurological signs.
Neither CSF discordance nor CSF escape was associated with 
age, sex, presenting symptoms, or CPE score. In multivariate 
analysis, CSF discordance was associated with DWMSA on MRI 
(adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 10.3 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 
2.3–45.0]; P = .007) (Table 2). There was no evidence of clus-
tering of the data in the logistic regression with random-effects 
modeling (data not shown), suggesting that there was no impact 
of multiple LPs from the same patient on the statistical analyses. 
Results were not significantly altered when only patients on ART 
at the time of LP were considered (data not shown).
DWMSA on MRI (aOR, 56.9 [95% CI, 3.9–882.8], P = .003) was also associ-
ated with CSF escape in multivariate analyses (Table 3). The 
association between DWMSA and escape was still present 
when the acute MRIs were excluded from analysis (data not 
shown). Patients with CSF escape had been diagnosed at 
least 7 years prior to LP, and had received previous ART 
regimens, with evidence of drug resistance in plasma asso-
ciated virus in 6 of 6 individuals who had resistance tests 
sent (Table 4).

 MRI Changes and CSF HIV-1 Viral Escape • CID 2017:64 (15 April) • 1063
DISCUSSION
In this single-center retrospective study, 15% of individuals 
undergoing LP had CSF/plasma VL discordance and 6% had 
CNS escape. The 15% prevalence of CSF discordance is sim-
ilar to the 12% reported by Nightingale et al [2] and the 21% 
found by Rawson et al in London [1]. The 6% prevalence of CSF 
escape agrees with the 0–15% quoted in a systematic review by 
Pérez Valero et al [5].
In patients on ART, CSF discordance was observed in 8%. 
We found DWMSA on MRI to be significantly associated with 
CSF discordance and escape, and this is a novel finding. Diffuse 
white matter signal abnormalities were found in all 11 of a 
small, uncontrolled, cohort of patients with CSF discordance 
[4], and in the majority of another retrospective cohort study 
[12]. Diffuse white matter signal abnormalities occur more 
commonly in the HIV-infected population compared with the 
HIV-uninfected population and become more extensive with 
duration of infection [18]. The presence of HIV in the CSF is 
proinflammatory as evidenced by raised levels of CSF neopterin 
[3] and cytokine profiles [17]. Nightingale et al [17], using CSF 
samples from the penetration of antiretroviral therapy into the 
nervous system study, showed the presence of higher levels of 
inflammatory cytokines in the CSF of individuals with discord-
ance when compared with matched controls. The presence of 
diffuse white matter signal abnormalities on MRI is associated 
with neurocognitive deficit. Neuropathological correlation sug-
gests that these changes can be caused by HIV replication [19].
In the subgroup analysis, individuals with CSF escape had 
normal (>350 cells/µL) CD4 counts at the time of the LP. This

 1064 • CID 2017:64 (15 April) • Kugathasan et al
observation is consistent with findings from the case series by 
Canestri et al [4] and Peluso et al [12]. This highlights that the 
presence of a normal CD4 count does not exclude the possibil-
ity of CSF escape.
We found no association with CPE scores agreeing with 
the recent study by Nightingale et al [2], but in contrast to 
the findings of both Rawson et al [1] and Canestri et al [4]. 
Given that ART regimen was not random and likely a con-
founding factor, this result for CPE score should be viewed 
with caution.
The limitations associated with this study mostly relate to 
its cross-sectional nature. The lack of association with CPE 
score could be confounded by potential prescriber bias. In 
addition, we did not measure patient compliance with ART 
or record the start dates of ART therapy. There is a very short 
decay period between when ART is initiated or changed and 
the CSF VL starts to fall [20]. The indications for MRI were 
not blinded, and could have resulted in reporter bias with 
more acute presentations less likely to elicit comments on 
subtle findings such as white matter changes. The impact of 
this is likely small, since the association is still present when 
the acute MRIs are excluded from analysis. A further limita-
tion is that we did not have data on HIV drug resistance in 
CSF, patients’ use of recreational drugs, or their ethnicity and 
sexuality.
Of note, our study was not able to explore the effect of PI 
monotherapy on CNS discordance/escape. In the context of 
adequate viral load monitoring, PI monotherapy can be used 
in some individuals with reduced toxicity and no increase in 
cross-resistance [21–23], despite randomized controlled trials 
showing inferior suppression of HIV-1 in CSF with boosted PI 
monotherapy compared with triple therapy [6, 24]. There are 
retrospective reports of patients developing NCI on boosted PI 
monotherapy with evidence of CSF discordance [7, 25], although 
the protease inhibitor therapy versus ongoing triple therapy trial 
showed no evidence for risk of neurological symptoms in sup-
pressed patients who were randomized to boosted PI monother-
apy, compared to those continuing standard triple therapy [26].
In summary, this study adds to the body of knowledge by 
demonstrating an association between MRI diffuse white 
matter signal abnormalities and both HIV discordance and 
escape. Previous studies of discordance and MRI findings have 
involved smaller numbers and have not directly measured the 
strength of the association. Physicians should be aware that 
the presence of DWMSAs on MRI in a peripherally suppressed 
individual with neurological symptoms may suggest HIV rep-
lication in CSF and that a normal CD4 count does not exclude 
this phenomenon. Longitudinal studies with serial MRI find-
ings correlated with peripheral and CSF VL will be needed 
to further evaluate this association. Finally, we advocate the
