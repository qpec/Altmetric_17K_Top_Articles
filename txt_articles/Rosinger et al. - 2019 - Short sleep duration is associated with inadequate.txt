Abstract
Study Objectives: Short and long sleep durations are linked to reduced kidney function, but little research has examined how sleep is associated with hydration 
status. Our aim was to assess the relationship between sleep duration and urinary hydration biomarkers among adults in a cross-cultural context.
Methods: Three samples of adults aged ≥20 years were analyzed: 2007–2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES; n = 4680), 2009–2012 
NHANES (n = 9559), and 2012 cross-sectional wave of the Chinese Kailuan Study (n = 11903), excluding pregnant women and adults with failing kidneys. We estimated 
multiple linear regression models between self-reported usual night-time sleep duration (<6, 6, 7, 8 (reference), and ≥9 hr/day) and urine specific gravity (Usg) and 
urine osmolality (Uosm) as continuous variables and logistic regression models dichotomized as inadequate hydration (>1.020 g/mL; >831 mOsm/kg). In primary 
analyses, we estimated models excluding diabetes and diuretic medications for healthier subpopulations (NHANES, n = 11353; Kailuan, n = 8766).
Results: In the healthier NHANES subset, 6 hr was associated with significantly higher Usg and odds of inadequate hydration (adjusted OR: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.25, 2.03) 
compared with 8 hr. Regression results were mixed using Uosm, but in the same direction as Usg. Among Chinese adults, short sleep duration (<6 and 6 hr) was 
associated with Usg and higher likelihood of inadequate hydration (6 hr adjusted OR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.26, 1.60). No consistent association was found with sleeping 
≥9 hr.
Conclusions: Short sleep duration was associated with higher odds of inadequate hydration in US and Chinese adults relative to sleeping 8 hr.

Statement of Significance
Although sleep duration has been associated with kidney function, few studies have examined how sleep is associated with hydration 
status. Disrupting the late sleep period may increase risk of dehydration and subsequently lead to acute kidney injury. This study, using 
cross-sectional data on adults from a US nationally representative survey and a large Chinese cohort, finds that short sleep duration 
(6 hr), compared with 8 hr of sleep, was associated with higher odds of inadequate hydration using urinary biomarkers. Longitudinal and 
experimental research is needed to further examine physiological feedback loops, including the role of vasopressin release during sleep, 
and recovery processes linking sleep duration and hydration status. Short sleep was associated with inadequate hydration in a cross-
cultural context.

Introduction
Sleep duration has been associated with myriad health 
outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, 
and chronic kidney disease (CKD) [1–5]. However, a key aspect 
of population health, which has received less attention, is how 
sleep relates to actual hydration status for adults in the general 
population.
Proper hydration is critical to physiological functioning 
and health [6, 7]. The short-term health consequences of body 
water deficit, or inadequate hydration, are headaches, fatigue, 
irritability, dry mouth, visual acuity, and in severe cases, loss of 
motor function and death [8–10]. 
Therefore, identifying biological 
and behavioral aspects of daily life which are modifiable and 
related to hydration status may help improve general well-
being and reduce risk of chronic conditions associated with 
dehydration, like urolithiasis (kidney stones) and urinary tract 
infections [6].
Hydration status is part of a tightly linked and regulated 
hormonal system of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone, which 
regulates urine concentration and body water conservation [6, 
11]. Vasopressin is released in response to hydration status, but 
is also part of a circadian rhythm [12]. Vasopressin increases 
in the late sleep period to help avoid dehydration [13, 14]. 
Therefore, missing this sleep period through short sleep may 
affect vasopressin release and disrupt body water homeostasis 
[14]. Long sleep may be associated with worse hydration through 
changes to vasopressin release as well as higher water losses 
from respiration and longer periods of water intake restriction 
[13]. Previous research has indicated that among those who 
sleep for short (<7 hr) and long periods of time (>9 hr) there is 
disruption in many homeostatic systems that are intertwined 
with hydration, including insulin sensitivity [15], hunger/satiety 
endocrine–signaling systems [4], cardiovascular function [1], 
and kidney function [16]. It is therefore possible that short and 
long sleep may consequently negatively affect hydration status 
as well.
A significant gap exists in the literature identifying how sleep 
and hydration status are related. One recent study evaluated the 
effect of controlled dehydration compared with euhydration on 
sleep quality and sleep quantity in young, healthy adults [17]. 
This study did not find that mild dehydration through body 
water loss affected either sleep duration or quality. However, this 
study examined only the direction of mild dehydration effects 
on sleep and is limited by small sample size. At a population 
level, it is unclear how sleep may be directly associated with 
hydration status outside of some common upstream factors, 
particularly across the lifespan. Moreover, information related 
to sleep is increasingly important in a cross-cultural context 
as many social/cultural, environmental, and political factors 
surrounding access to clean water may increase stress [18–20] 
and modify both hydration status and sleep. These factors could 
serve as confounders to understanding the relationship in any 
one study site.
Therefore, the objective of this paper is to examine 
how reported usual night-time sleep duration is associated 
with urinary measures of hydration status in a nationally 
representative sample of US adults and a large cohort of Chinese 
adults. We hypothesize that short and long duration of sleep 
will be associated with more concentrated urine and higher 
probability of inadequate hydration across populations. We test 
this using two biomarkers of hydration status, urine specific 
gravity (Usg) and urine osmolality (Uosm), on different cross-
sectional, nationally representative samples from the National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and one 
biomarker, Usg, from the Chinese Kailuan Study.
Methods
NHANES study design
The NHANES uses a complex, stratified multistage probability 
design to create a nationally representative sample of the 
noninstitutionalized, civilian US population. This survey uses 
both in-person interviews alongside physical examinations, 
which take place in Mobile Examination Centers (MECs). The 
sampling procedures and methodology of NHANES are described 
in detail elsewhere [21, 22]. Since 1999, NHANES has been 
continuously conducted with data released in 2 year cycles by 
the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Data for these 
analyses come from the 2007–2008, 2009–2010, and 2011–2012 
cycles. The examination response rate varied between 64.4% 
and 72.2% during these cycles for adults. The NCHS Research 
Ethics Review Board approved the continuous NHANES and all 
adult participants gave written informed consent.
Kailuan study design
The Kailuan Study is an ongoing multicenter cohort that 
includes 101 510 Chinese adults in Tangshan city, China, which 
was designed to study risk factors for noncommunicable 
disease in a Chinese population [23]. Baseline information (e.g. 
lifestyle factors and medical history) was collected in 2006–2007 
and updated every 2 years. In 2012, information was collected 
on sleep habits in 12 990 adults (10 725 men and 2 265 women) 
aged 25–95 years who were evaluated at the Kailuan general 
hospital, one of the 11 centers, and free of neurodegenerative 
diseases, as detailed elsewhere [2, 24, 25]. This site was chosen 
for this analysis because it was the only one where sleep 
information was collected. However, the participants from the 
Kailuan center subgroup study had younger age (baseline age 
54 vs 58, p < 0.01) and higher proportion of men (82.6% vs 79.5%) 
relative to other sites. We excluded 1085 participants (8.4%) with 
missing information on sleep duration or Usg, leaving 11 905 in 
the current analyses. Excluded participants had similar age (55 
vs 54 years) and body mass index (BMI, 25.4 vs 24.7), but a lower 
proportion of men (79% vs 83%), slightly shorter sleep duration 
(6.8 vs 7.1 hr/day), and a slightly lower prevalence of diabetes 
(11.2% vs 11.9%). The Kailuan Study was approved by the ethics 
committees of the Kailuan Medical Group, Kailuan Group, and 
the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston. All participants 
provided written informed consent.
Main dependent variable: hydration status
Urine specific gravity
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. In 2007–2008, 
adults provided urine samples in the MEC. These samples 
were measured for urine specific gravity, or the density of 
urine relative to water, using a digital hand-held refractometer 
(ATAGO PAL-10S), with automatic temperature compensation. 
Usg is commonly used for laboratory and field measurements 
of hydration status and urine concentration [26]. Usg values

vary between 1.000 and 1.040 g/mL with values >1.020 g/mL 
representing inadequate hydration [27].
The Kailuan Study.  A single random midstream morning urine 
sample was collected from each participant during the interview 
in 2012. Usg was assessed using instrument colorimetric 
method (a reagent strip method, also called the dry chemistry 
test method [28]) within 2 hr of urine sample collection (H12-MA 
test strips, Changchun Dirui Medical Technology Co., Ltd. 
Changchun, China). All urine samples were measured using a 
urine analyzer (N-600, Dirui, Changchun, China) at the central 
laboratory of the Kailuan general hospital. The results of Usg 
were rounded to 0.005 g/mL for a minimum of 1.000 g/mL and a 
maximum of 1.030 g/mL.
Urine osmolality
In 2009–2012, adults in NHANES provided spot urine samples 
in the MEC. Urine osmolality (Uosm), which is the total 
concentration of dissolved particles per kg of water in urine, was 
determined by freezing point depression osmometry in the MEC 
lab, calculated as milliosmoles per kilogram (mOsm/kg). Uosm 
is highly correlated with Usg and is a reliable urinary biomarker 
of daily hydration status [29]. Uosm values vary between 50 
and 1200 mOsm/kg with values >831 mOsm/kg representing 
inadequate hydration [29].
Main independent variable: sleep duration
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
Participants were asked about their sleeping habits in their 
home, using the Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) 
system, as part of the survey participant household interview. To 
estimate the usual amount of sleep participants obtained on a 
nightly basis, they were asked “How much sleep do you usually 
get at night on weekdays or workdays?” This question did not 
take into account daytime naps and responses were in integer 
hour increments.
The Kailuan Study
Participants were asked to report usual total hours of actual 
sleep during the night to the half hour and also did not take into 
account daytime naps.
Based on previous research that has indicated a U-shaped 
pattern between hours of sleep and health outcomes where both 
short sleep and long sleep were seen as potential risk factors [1], 
we categorized sleep based on the latest recommendations at 
less than 6 hr of sleep, 6, 7, 8, and 9 hr or more hours of sleep 
[30]. We treated 8 hr of sleep as the reference category since this 
is often viewed as an ideal sleep duration by sleep experts [31].
Covariates
We adjusted for several known confounders in this analysis 
depending on data availability by site. In NHANES, sex (male 
and female), race/Hispanic origin (non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic black, Hispanic, and other [including all non-Hispanic 
individuals reporting more than one race]), BMI (kg/m2), alcohol 
intake (g), caffeine intake (mg), total water intake (ml), physical 
activity (minutes), time of the exam (morning, afternoon, or 
evening), and diabetes status were included as covariates in the 
NHANES analysis to control for potential confounding [32–37].
Alcohol, caffeine, and water intakes were derived from the 
in-person 24 hr dietary recall using the Automated Multiple Pass 
Method (AMPM) in the MEC. The AMPM recall method minimizes 
bias by improving respondent recall of foods and beverages 
consumed in the previous 24 hr period from midnight to 
midnight through standardized probes [38]. Caffeine intake was 
dichotomized at 400 mg (< or ≥400 mg) because consumption 
above that level is associated with higher risk of dehydration 
[32, 33].
The Global Physical Activity Questionnaire was used to 
construct the physical activity variable [39]. During the home 
interview, participants were asked, using the CAPI system, to 
list the total time they spent in the previous week in moderate 
and vigorous activities from biking or walking, work, and leisure 
activities. Physical activity was dichotomized based on whether 
the individual met national guidelines of 150 min or more per 
week of moderate or vigorous physical activity [40].
To test for diabetes, blood specimens were collected in 
the MEC for all participants and samples were analyzed for 
hemoglobin 
A1c (HbA1C) in the Fairview Medical Center Laboratory 
at the University of Minnesota. Adults with HbA1C values of 6.5% 
or higher [41] or who reported that a doctor ever told them they 
had diabetes were categorized as having diabetes.
Medication information (if they had taken prescription 
medications in the last 30 days) was obtained through self-report 
by showing the container to the interviewer. The prescriptions 
were coded by NCHS. The codes for any diuretic medication (e.g. 
loop, thiazide, and potassium-sparing) were identified and used 
to exclude participants in some of the analyses as they affect 
urine concentration.
In the Kailuan Study, information on potential confounders 
was collected via questionnaire (i.e. age, sex, physical activity 
[none = 1, seldom = 2, highly active = 3], and alcohol drinking 
status [1 = never; 2 = light, <2 servings; 3 = moderate, 2–5 
servings; 4 = heavy, >=5 servings; 5 = current without servings 
data; 6 = past]) [2] and face-to-face examination (i.e. height, 
weight, and blood pressure) by trained field workers (nurses and 
doctors) [23]. Diabetes was diagnosed as fasting blood glucose 
≥7 mmol/L (126 g/L) or had a history of physician-diagnosed 
diabetes [42]. Medication use data were collected on participants 
and all diuretic drugs were coded to exclude participants based 
on participant self-report.
Statistical analysis
Statistical significance was set at α = 0.05 for a two-tailed test. 
Analyses were conducted in Stata 15.0 (College Station, TX) 
using the survey commands with standard errors (SE) estimated 
by Taylor series linearization due to the complex, four-stage 
sample design of NHANES per their analytic guidelines [43]. 
Because we controlled for dietary intake variables, we used 
day one dietary sample weights to adjust for over-sampling, 
nonresponse, noncoverage, and day of the week. Descriptive 
statistics characterizing the NHANES samples were estimated 
with and without exclusions for adults with diabetes and those 
who reported taking a diuretic prescription medication in the 
past 30 days to estimate the relationship between sleep and 
hydration status for the full samples and a healthier subset 
(Table 1).
Fractional polynomial plots were created between sleep 
hours as a continuous variable on Usg and Uosm, to allow for

a curvilinear relationship to emerge. Multiple linear regression 
models were used to test the association between sleep duration 
category and Usg and Uosm controlling for confounders with and 
without additional exclusions for both NHANES and the Kailuan 
Study. We used logistic regression models to examine the odds 
of inadequate hydration with elevated Usg (>1.020 g/mL) and 
elevated Uosm (>831 mOsm/kg). We tested for interactions 
between sleep category and race/ethnicity, sex, weight status, 
age, and time of the exam and none were significant in linear 
regressions. Therefore, no interactions were included in the final 
models presented.
We conducted three sensitivity checks. We re-estimated 
the associations using different sleep categories, i.e. 7 
and 8 hr combined as the reference category since some 
recommendations cite a need of a minimum 7 hr sleep [30]. 
Second, we re-estimated the analyses with a stricter inadequate 
hydration cut-off for Usg (>1.025 g/mL) [29]. Finally, we 
re-estimated models additionally adjusting for sleep disorders: 
(1) in the NHANES models, whether a doctor had ever told the 
participant they had a sleeping disorder (insomnia, sleep apnea, 
restless leg syndrome [RLS], or other). (2) In the Kailuan cohort, 
we additionally adjusted for data on insomnia and snoring, no 
data were collected on RLS.
Sample
In NHANES, pregnant women (2007–2008: n = 56; 2009–2012: 
n = 108) and adults who reported they had ever been told by 
a doctor they had weak or failing kidneys (2007–2008: n = 137; 
2009–2012: n = 279) were excluded from all analyses leaving an 
analytical sample of n = 4680 and n = 9599, respectively, without 
missing sleep, hydration, or covariate data. In the primary 
analyses, we additionally excluded adults with diabetes and 
those currently taking diuretics (2007–2008: n = 991; 2009–2012: 
n = 1935). This resulted in final sample sizes of n = 3689 in 2007–
2008 and n = 7664 in 2009–2012.
Among the Kailuan Study, 11 905 adults in 2012 had full sleep 
information and Usg data. T
wo adults were missing alcohol

drinking status information, yielding 11 903 adults in the main 
analyses. In the Kailuan cohort, weak or failing kidneys were 
identified through proteinuria (>300 mg/dL) or eGFR<60 mL/min 
per 1.73 m2 (methods are described elsewhere [2]) and additional 
exclusions were made based on these criteria. No pregnant 
women were examined in the study. In the primary analyses, we 
sequentially excluded 2859 adults who reported diabetes or any 
type of diuretic medication, and an additional 278 due to weak 
or failing kidneys, yielding a final sample size of 8766.
Results
NHANES: urine-specific gravity
In the 2007–2008 sample, using a best-fitting fractional 
polynomial between the continuous measure of sleep duration 
(hr) and Usg, a mild U-shaped relationship was observed 
(Figure 1). This suggests that mean Usg at a population level is 
highest for adults who reported short amounts of sleep and that 
the mean decreases until 8 to 9 hr of sleep where it begins to 
increase again.
We next examined multiple linear regression models 
examining the association between sleep duration and Usg 
with and without additional exclusions adjusted for covariates 
(Table 2; Models 1 and 2). Both models indicated that compared 
with reporting 8 hr of sleep, adults who reported 6 hr of sleep 
on a usual basis had significantly more concentrated urine 
(Model 2: Adjusted beta [B] = 0.0011, standard error [SE] = 0.0004, 
p = 0.013).
Multiple 
logistic 
regression 
models 
evaluating 
the 
relationship between sleep duration and inadequate hydration 
using the standard cutoff (>1.020 g/mL) demonstrated a similar 
relationship to the linear models (Table 2; Models 3 and 4). 
Adults who reported 6 hr of sleep had 1.59 (95% CI: 1.25, 2.01; 
p = 0.001) times the odds of having elevated Usg than adults who 
reported 8 hr of sleep. Additionally, adults who reported 7 hr of 
sleep also had higher odds (OR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.61) than 
adults who reported 8 hr of sleep. Very short sleepers (<6 hr) and 
long sleepers (9+ hr) did not have significantly different odds of 
inadequate hydration, likely because of lower sample sizes in 
those bins (Figure 1).
NHANES: urine osmolality
A mild U-shaped relationship was again observed between sleep 
duration and Uosm (Figure 2). In multiple linear regression models, 
adults reporting 6 hr of sleep had significantly higher Uosm (β = 23.8 
mOsm/kg, SE = 9.47; Table 3; Model 2) than adults who reported 
8 hr of sleep adjusted for covariates. No other sleep duration was 
significantly different from the reference category of 8 hr.
The results trended in the same direction in logistic 
regression models, but did not reach significance. Here, adults 
who reported sleeping 6 hr had 1.16 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.40) times

getting 8 hr of sleep. Interestingly, in the Uosm data, adults 
who reported 7 hr of sleep had lower odds (OR = 0.81; 95% CI: 
0.66, 1.00) of being inadequately hydrated than those with 8 hr 
of sleep.
Kailuan Study: urine-specific gravity
Unlike the US NHANES data, the Chinese Kailuan data exhibited 
a negative linear relationship between sleep duration and Usg 
(Figure 3). In multiple linear regression, adults who reported less 
than 6 and 6–6.5 hr of sleep had significantly more concentrated 
urine than adults who reported sleeping 8–8.5 hr of sleep for the 
full sample and when excluding adults on diuretic medications 
and with diabetes (Table 4; Models 1 and 2). Similarly, in multiple 
logistic regressions, adults who reported less than 6 (aOR: 1.45, 
95% CI: 1.24, 1.68), 6–6.5 (aOR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.26, 1.60), and 7–7.5 
(aOR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.11, 1.42) hr had significantly higher odds of 
inadequate hydration than adults who slept 8–8.5 hr (Table 4; 
Model 4). Results between long sleep (≥9 hr) and Usg were mixed 
in linear and logistic models (Table 4; Models 2 and 4). Long sleep 
was associated with significantly lower Usg in linear models 
(B = −0.0013, SE = 0.0006; p = 0.024), whereas no association was 
found in the logistic regression models.
Comparison of Usg results from NHANES and the 
Kailuan Study
Because Usg was collected in both the NHANES and the Kailuan 
Study, we compared the results of the logistic regressions for 
inadequate hydration (Figure 4). Interestingly, the results are 
similar for both samples in comparing 6 and 7 hr, respectively, 
to 8 hr of sleep. However, the main difference is seen for the 
shortest and longest sleepers as the Kailuan Study data 
presented more of a dose–response-like stepwise reduction in 
odds of inadequate hydration with increasing sleep.
Sensitivity analyses
Results between sleep duration and Usg, Uosm, and inadequate 
hydration were consistent when we used different categories of

sleep (7–8 hr inclusive as the reference category) for NHANES 
(Supplementary Tables S1 and S2) and the Kailuan Study 
(Supplementary Table S3). Results were consistently significant 
with adults who reported 5–6 hr (inclusive) of sleep having 17%–
32% significantly higher odds of inadequate hydration across 
the three samples using both Usg and Uosm (Supplementary 
Tables S1–S3).
When a stricter cutoff for inadequate hydration was used 
for Usg (>1.025 g/mL), logistic regression results were consistent 
for the Kailuan Study and stronger for NHANES than in the 
primary analyses. In the healthier subset of NHANES, adults 
who reported sleeping 6 hr had 1.94 (95% CI: 1.40, 2.69) times 
the odds of being inadequately hydrated compared with adults 
getting 8 hr of sleep (full results not shown).
Finally, when re-estimating the NHANES and Kailuan 
regression models additionally adjusting for sleep disorders, 
results were strongly consistent with the adjusted results and 
did not materially change (results not shown).
Discussion
The results from this nationally representative US survey and 
large Chinese cohort provide evidence at the population level 
that short, but not long, sleep duration was associated with more 
concentrated urine and higher odds of inadequate hydration. We 
examined how sleep duration was associated with two urinary 
biomarkers of hydration status. In both populations, adults 
who reported sleeping 6 hr had significantly more concentrated 
urine and 16%–59% higher odds of being inadequately hydrated 
compared with adults who slept 8 hr on a regular basis at night. 
Long sleepers, those who slept 9 or more hours, did not exhibit 
worse hydration status than normal sleepers. Although the 
adjusted betas were small for the continuous measures of Usg 
and Uosm, the net result at a population level of having more 
adults with inadequate hydration can lead to negative health 
implications. For example, mild dehydration is associated with 
cognitive [44], mood [45], and physiological [46] impairments, 
and if dehydration is chronic, this can lead to increased risk of 
kidney stones and urinary tract infections [6].
Our analyses using both continuous and dichotomous Usg 
and Uosm variables from NHANES and the Kailuan Chinese 
cohort provided consistent results in comparing adults sleeping 
6, 7, and 8 hr with the overall samples and with healthier 
subsamples, i.e. excluding adults with diabetes and those taking 
diuretic medications. The large majority of US and Chinese 
adults (~80%–88%) reported between 6 and 8 hr (inclusive) of 
sleep on a usual basis. Therefore, teasing apart the relationship 
beyond these sleep durations may require larger sample sizes in 
these subgroups of adults.
Previous cross-sectional and longitudinal research has found 
that short sleep duration is associated with higher risk of CKD, 
higher kidney filtration rates, and elevated albumin–creatinine 
clearance [16, 47, 48]. For example, the prevalence of sleep-
related problems, including short sleep duration, was found to 
be higher among adults with CKD [48]. Additionally, each hour 
less of sleep was associated with higher glomerular filtration 
rate over 10 years of follow-up [16]. These findings suggest that 
kidney health is negatively affected by short sleep duration, and 
these effects may translate into dysregulation of body water 
through vasopressin release. Results of a significant association 
between sleep duration and inadequate hydration presented 
here add to, and support, growing evidence that short sleep 
duration has implications for kidney health.
A key physiological pathway connecting hydration status 
and sleep relates to the circadian rhythm release of antidiuretic 
hormone or vasopressin. Research in both humans and rats 
has found that vasopressin release increases in the late sleep 
period, which serves to help moderate hydration status during 
sleep given that this is a period where water intake in inhibited 
and respiratory water loss increases [12, 13]. If the late sleep 
period is disrupted, then this suggests that individuals may not 
experience the increased release of vasopressin for homeostasis 
of body water which may increase vulnerability to dehydration 
[14].
It is unclear from our data what is driving this association, 
whether shorter sleep duration is affecting vasopressin release, 
which affects kidney concentration of urine, or whether shorter 
sleep duration is also associated with other health factors 
uncontrolled for that may affect hydration status. For example, 
short sleep duration may be associated with hydration-related 
behaviors, e.g. drinking less fluid, as part of a feedback loop. 
Although the literature is scant on the relationship of how 
poor sleep or short sleep adversely affects hydration status and 
thirst [49], anecdotal reports describe repeated difficulties with 
blood draws and reported headaches, symptoms of dehydration, 
among experimental participants who have been sleep-deprived 
[49]. Previous research using NHANES data found that greater 
water intake in the diet was associated with less likelihood of 
short and long sleep durations [50], indicating a protective effect 
of water intake. We attempted to address this by controlling 
for total water intake in the NHANES analysis in the current 
paper (water intake was not available in the Kailuan Chinese 
cohort). When water intake was not adjusted for in the NHANES 
analysis, results between sleep and hydration status remained 
consistent (results not shown).
Although we examined the association between sleep 
and hydration status, a recent experimental study tested the 
hypothesis that controlled dehydration negatively affects sleep 
duration and quality [17], the opposite direction of our proposed 
relationship. They found, using a cross-over design, with a

small sample (N = 12) of healthy young males in a euhydrated 
state and in a dehydrated state, that sleep quality and duration 
did not significantly vary between the conditions. However, this 
study measured one night of sleep in each condition and had a 
small sample size. One notable finding was that the percentage 
of mean REM sleep decreased by 7 percentage points (35.1% 
± 18.8 vs 28.1% ± 9.7) and the percentage of mean light sleep 
increased by 6.8 percentage points (41.2% ± 15.5 vs 48.0% ± 11.9) 
in the dehydrated condition compared with the euhydrated 
condition, though not significant likely due to the low sample 
size. This study did not measure vasopressin during sleep and 
so it is hard to know whether vasopressin differed between 
conditions.
Limitations
All data are observational and from cross-sectional studies or a 
cross-sectional wave of a cohort study; therefore, the association 
results from this study should not be viewed as causal. 
Furthermore, it is not possible to investigate the direction of this 
association and it is subject to reverse-causality bias, whereby 
hydration status may be affecting sleep duration, although a 
previous report does not support this [17]. Future studies could 
test this hypothesis to further untangle the direction of the 
association.
Reported sleep is the usual amount of sleep, not necessarily 
the amount of sleep the participant had the previous night, 
which would be a more accurate measure for this relationship. 
Further study using direct measurement of sleep duration is 
warranted and could assess both the usual average amount of 
sleep for a time period (e.g. a week or a month) and the amount 
of sleep the night before measurement of hydration status. 
Additionally, although we have relatively large sample sizes in 
both populations, the vast majority of adults reported obtaining 
6–8 hr of sleep, so we are unable to examine with high resolution 
this relationship for the extremes of the population, i.e. those 
who sleep less than 6 hr and those who sleep 9 or more hours 
per night on a regular basis.
Differences in available covariate data, measurement 
differences, and population parameters may introduce residual 
confounding. The Kailuan Study was 83% male vs 50% male for 
NHANES and the same dietary intake data were not available. 
The Kailuan Study used a reagent strip method to assess Usg, 
which is less reliable [28] than the refractometry method used 
in NHANES, and data were rounded to 0.005 g/mL versus the 
0.001 g/mL precision in NHANES. Reagent strips have been 
found to be highly associated with Usg however (r = 0.81) [51]. 
Furthermore, we are limited by one urinary biomarker per 
sample and do not have multiple biomarkers per participant. 
We also do not have repeated measures of hydration status 
for the same individuals to assess how this relationship may 
manifest within an individual over time and varying hydration 
levels. However, the replication of this association across 
populations in different cultural contexts overcomes country-
level confounding identified in the majority of studies. Future 
studies should use the same methodology across sites and 
examine this relationship longitudinally over the course of 
a week to understand baseline sleep and hydration status. 
Finally, we do not have information on vasopressin to examine 
how differences in vasopressin may potentially mediate the 
relationship between sleep and hydration status.
Strengths
This paper has several strengths. We use two urinary markers 
of hydration status, which are sensitive to changes in daily 
hydration status [36], to assess this relationship on two nationally 
representative samples from the United States and with a large 
cohort of Chinese adults. Second, through additional exclusions 
of adults with diabetes and those taking diuretics, mostly for 
hypertensive medications, we examined the relationship on a 
healthier subpopulation and reduce confounding from these 
medical conditions. The results are consistent across urinary 
biomarkers on separate samples, across time periods, with 
additional exclusions, using different sleep categories, and 
inadequate hydration cutoff. This is the first large-scale study, to 
the best of our knowledge, that examines the association between 
sleep duration and hydration status in a cross-cultural context.
Conclusions
Short sleep duration was associated with worse hydration 
status at a population level for US and Chinese adults. Adults 
who reported sleeping 6 hr on a nightly basis had significantly 
more concentrated urine and higher odds of being inadequately 
hydrated compared with adults who reported sleeping 
8 hr. Long sleepers did not have significantly greater risk of 
inadequate hydration. Future studies should examine this 
relationship experimentally to assess how variation in sleep 
duration and quality affects next day markers of hydration 
status longitudinally. Increasing sleep may have cascading 
biobehavioral health benefits, one of them being better hydration 
status, which may be protective of CKD.
