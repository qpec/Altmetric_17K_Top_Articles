In November 2015, the Brazilian Ministry of Health (MOH) 
declared the Zika virus outbreak a public health emergency 
after an increase in microcephaly cases was reported in the 
northeast region of the country (1). During 2015–2016, 
15 states in Brazil with laboratory-confirmed Zika virus 
transmission reported an increase in birth prevalence of micro-
cephaly (2.8 cases per 10,000 live births), significantly exceed-
ing prevalence in four states without confirmed transmission 
(0.6 per 10,000) (2). Although children with microcephaly and 
laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection have been described 
in early infancy (3), their subsequent health and development 
have not been well characterized, constraining planning for 
the care and support of these children and their families. The 
Brazilian MOH, the State Health Secretariat of Paraíba, and 
CDC collaborated on a follow-up investigation of the health 
and development of children in northeastern Brazil who were 
reported to national surveillance with microcephaly at birth. 
Nineteen children with microcephaly at birth and laboratory 
evidence of Zika virus infection were assessed through clinical 
evaluations, caregiver interviews, and review of medical records. 
At follow-up (ages 19–24 months), most of these children 
had severe motor impairment, seizure disorders, hearing and 
vision abnormalities, and sleep difficulties. Children with 
microcephaly and laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection 
have severe functional limitations and will require specialized 
care from clinicians and caregivers as they age.
The Zika Outcomes and Development in Infants and 
Children (ZODIAC) investigation sought to compile a com-
prehensive description of health and development among 
children aged >12 months who were born with microcephaly 
and participated in a 2016 case-control investigation. The 
case-control investigation assessed the association of Zika virus 
infection and microcephaly among children aged 1–7 months, 
living in Paraíba state. The children and their caregivers were 
evaluated by multidisciplinary teams at two state clinics in 
Campina Grande and João Pessoa (macroregions 1 and 2) 
in Paraíba state during August–October 2017. This report 
describes a subsample of 19 children, aged 19–24 months, who 
participated in ZODIAC and were born with microcephaly 
and with laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection.
All children in the ZODIAC investigation were born 
from October 1, 2015 through January 31, 2016, and were 
reported to the Registro de Eventos de Saúde Pública (RESP)—
Microcefalias, Brazil’s national microcephaly registry. For 
infants to be eligible for the 2016 case-control investigation, 
their mothers must have resided in Paraíba state for at least 80% 
of their pregnancy. For the ZODIAC investigation, microceph-
aly was defined as head circumference below the third percen-
tile for gestational age and sex, according to INTERGROWTH 
21st standards (4). Subsequent measurements are reported in 
standard deviations (SD) to better characterize growth defi-
ciencies (5). Laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection was 
defined as a positive test for Zika virus immunoglobulin M 
(IgM) and virus specific-neutralizing antibodies or a positive 
test for Zika virus-specific neutralizing antibodies in an infant 
sample (6). Samples were obtained at age 1–7 months in the 
2016 case-control investigation, and any evidence of infection 
was assumed to be prenatal in origin. Results of prenatal and 
newborn testing to rule out other congenital infections were 
available for some infants and their mothers.
ZODIAC data were collected through clinical evaluations, 
caregiver interviews, and review of medical records. Licensed 
physicians performed growth, ophthalmologic and physical 
exams, and a neurologic assessment. Physicians were trained 
to use the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination 
(HINE), a standardized neurologic exam, to assess neuromotor 
function and visual and auditory responses (7). Trained inter-
viewers administered screening and assessment instruments to 
the primary caregiver (usually the mother) regarding the child’s 
health and development, including a seizure screener (8), the 
Ages and Stages Questionnaires (ASQ-3),* and the Ages and 
Stages Social-Emotional Questionnaires (ASQ:SE).† Data were 
captured in REDCap, a secure web application.
* A series of 21 parent-completed questionnaires designed to screen the 
developmental performance of children aged 1–66 months in the areas of 
communication, gross motor skills, fine motor skills, problem solving, and 
personal-social skills. The age-appropriate questionnaire is completed by the 
parent or caregiver (http://agesandstages.com).
† A series of nine age-appropriate parent-completed questionnaires designed to 
screen young children for social-emotional issues during the first 6 years of life 
for seven social-emotional areas: self-regulation, compliance, adaptive 
functioning, autonomy, affect, social-communication, and interaction with 
people (http://agesandstages.com).

The families of 278 previously studied children residing in 
the ZODIAC investigation catchment area were eligible for 
inclusion; 122 children were enrolled, including 19 who were 
aged <24 months and who had both microcephaly at birth 
and laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection. Among the 
19 children, 11 had a blood specimen that tested positive for 
Zika virus-specific IgM antibodies and neutralizing antibodies 
against Zika virus, and eight had only neutralizing antibodies 
against Zika virus. Among the eight with neutralizing anti-
bodies only, seven had at least one test for other congenital 
infections; one had a positive Toxoplasma immunoglobulin G 
(IgG) antibody result and one had positive rubella virus and 
cytomegalovirus IgG results. Both had negative IgM antibody 
results for these infections; the first had brain imaging findings 
consistent with congenital Zika virus infection and the second 
had no record of imaging.
The median age at follow-up evaluation was 22 months 
(range = 19–24 months); 10 were male and nine were female. 
At the time of assessment, 15 children (seven males and eight 
females) had head circumference measurements more than 
3 SDs below the mean for their age and sex (Table 1) (Table 2). 
Four children had an increase in head circumference for age 
from birth measurements: three males had head circumfer-
ence within 1 SD below the mean and one female had head 
circumference within 1 SD above the mean. Thirteen children 
(six males and seven females) had length measurements 1–3 
SDs below the mean, and 13 children (six males and seven 
females) had weight measurements 1 to >3 SDs below the 
mean for their age and sex.
Eleven children screened positive for nonfebrile seizures, 
indicating possible seizure disorder (Table 2) (Table 3). 
Caregivers reported that eight children were previously hospi-
talized, including six hospitalized for bronchitis/pneumonia, 
and that 10 children had frequent sleeping difficulties and 
nine had eating or swallowing challenges. Thirteen children 
had an impaired response to auditory stimuli. Four children 
had retinal abnormalities and 11 had an impaired response to 
visual stimuli. Fifteen children did not pass the ASQ-3 age 
interval questionnaire designed for a child aged 6 months. 
Fifteen children had a global score below 40 on the HINE, 
indicating severe motor impairment, including 14 who had 
findings consistent with cerebral palsy (7). Outcomes including 
feeding challenges, sleeping difficulties, severe motor impair-
ment, vision and hearing abnormalities, and seizures tended 
to co-occur. All children had at least one of these outcomes, 
12 had three to five of these outcomes, and two had all six 
outcomes. Four children (infant number 16, 17, 18, and 19) 
(Table 2) had typical growth and development at follow-up 
and might have been misclassified at birth.

Discussion
As of September 2017, 2,986 newborns with microcephaly 
in Brazil were reported to RESP and 2,959 cases are being 
monitored (9). Children with Zika virus–associated micro-
cephaly face medical and functional challenges that span 
many areas of development. Previous reports established a 
baseline of poor health outcomes at birth, including severe 
brain and ophthalmologic abnormalities, and other serious 
central nervous system abnormalities (3). This report expands 
on initial findings by demonstrating that specific outcomes, 
such as severe motor impairment and impaired visual and 
auditory response to stimuli, affect the majority of children 
with evidence of congenital Zika virus infection and micro-
cephaly and become more apparent as these children age. 
Approximately three quarters of young children affected by 
Zika virus infection in this analysis had at least three of the 
specified co-occurring outcomes. Many of the initial findings

 ¶¶ The ASQ-3 is a series of 21 parent-completed questionnaires designed to screen the developmental performance of children aged 1–66 months in the areas of 
communication, gross motor skills, fine motor skills, problem solving, and personal-social skills (http://agesandstages.com); based on ASQ-3 screening, an age 
interval of <6 months indicates that the child’s parent-reported developmental progress has not advanced beyond that typical of an infant at age 6 months.
identified at birth remain present at ages 19–24 months, and 
these children are falling far behind in achievement of age-
appropriate developmental milestones, indicating the need 
for long-term follow-up and support.
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limita-
tions. First, although all children with microcephaly recruited 
into the 2016 case-control investigation from selected areas of 
Paraíba state were offered enrollment in the ZODIAC inves-
tigation, not all families chose to participate. Consequently, 
the findings might not be representative of all children with 
microcephaly associated with congenital Zika virus infection. 
Second, errors in head circumference measurement at birth 
and passive transfer of maternal antibodies might have led to 
misidentification and might explain the divergent observa-
tions for the four children showing more typical development. 
Additionally, some of the parent-assessment findings, such as 
those from the seizure screener, were not medically verified. 
Finally, the ages of infants in the original case-control investiga-
tion ranged from 1 to 7 months at the time of blood collection, 
and it is possible that the laboratory results for some infants 
reflected postnatal, rather than prenatal, exposure.

This report provides information on the ongoing challenges 
facing children with severe congenital Zika virus syndrome; 
these children will require specialized care from clinicians and 
caregivers as they age. These findings allow for anticipation of 
medical and social service needs of affected children and their 
families, including early intervention services, and planning for 
resources to support these families in health care and commu-
nity settings in Brazil, the United States, and other countries. 
Children with disabilities related to congenital Zika virus 
infection will need multidisciplinary care from various pediatric 
subspecialists (10). Long-term follow-up and measurement of 
developmental progression of children affected by Zika virus 
can inform intervention services and sub-specialties needed to 
provide optimal care for these children.
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Congenital Zika virus infection has been linked to increased 
rates of microcephaly and a unique pattern of birth defects 
among infants. Although children with microcephaly and 
laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection have been described 
in early infancy, the subsequent health and development in 
young children have not been well characterized, constraining 
planning for the care of these children. 
What is added by this report?
The growth and development of 19 children, aged 19–24 months, 
with laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection were 
thoroughly assessed. All children had at least one adverse 
outcome including feeding challenges, sleeping difficulties, 
severe motor impairment, vision and hearing abnormalities, 
and seizures, and these outcomes tended to co-occur. 
What are the implications for public health practice?
Children with microcephaly and laboratory evidence of Zika 
virus infection face medical and functional challenges that span 
many areas of development, some of which become more 
evident as children age. They will continue to require 
specialized care from clinicians and caregivers. These data allow 
for anticipation of medical and social services needs of affected 
children and families, such as early intervention services, and 
planning for resources to support these families in healthcare 
and community settings.
