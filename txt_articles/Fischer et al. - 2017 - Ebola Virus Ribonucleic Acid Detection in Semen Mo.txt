Among 149 men who survived Ebola virus disease (EVD) and 
donated semen 260–1016 days after EVD onset, Ebola virus 
(EBOV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) was detected in 13 (9%). Of 
137 men who donated semen 2 years after EVD onset, 11 (8%) 
had an EBOV RNA-positive specimen. The mechanism under-
lying the persistence of EBOV RNA in semen is unclear, and 
it is unclear whether the detection of viral RNA represents the 
presence of infectious virus.
Keywords. Ebola; PCR; semen; viral persistence. 
The well documented sexual transmission of Ebola virus 
(EBOV) by 2 men [1–3] who survived the 2013–2016 West 
Africa epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) coupled with the 
detection of EBOV ribonucleic acid (RNA) in semen months 
after recovery from EVD has raised concern for the continued 
risk of sexual transmission of EBOVs by asymptomatic survi-
vors [1–9].
Semen collected in cohort studies of EVD survivors in 
Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia have been analyzed for the 
presence of EBOV, and, as observed during earlier outbreaks, 
viral RNA has been detected during the early phase after 
recovery [4, 6, 8, 9]. Among the small number of men sam-
pled within approximately 3 months of acute EVD, as many as 
28% to 100% have been reported to harbor EBOV RNA in their 
semen [4, 8, 9].
The reported proportions of men with detectable viral RNA 
in their genital fluid later in the convalescent course have varied 
widely. Deen et al [4] detected EBOV RNA in the semen of 11 
(26%) of 43 men sampled at 7 to 9 months after EVD onset, 
whereas Sow et al [9] in Guinea found evidence of EBOV RNA 
in semen collected from only 2 of 31 (7%) men within a similar 
time period. There are even fewer data regarding the presence 
of EBOV RNA in the semen of EVD survivors further out from 
their disease onset, although cases of detectable viral RNA in 
the semen of men 407 to 565 days after Ebola Treatment Unit 
(ETU) release have been reported [2, 7, 10, 11].
Few studies have attempted to correlate the presence of 
EBOV RNA with the presence of replication-competent virus. 
Infectious virus has been detected in the semen of survivors 
up to 82 days after onset of EVD symptoms using Vero E6 cell 
culture models [6]. More recently, EBOV RNA was detected in 
the blood and organs of severe combined immunodeficiency 
(SCID) mice inoculated with EBOV RNA-positive semen col-
lected as long as 233 days after symptom onset and in a second 
group of SCID mice inoculated with lung homogenate from 
these animals [6, 7].
The prolonged presence of potentially infectious EBOVs in 
the male genital tract has implications for both personal and 
public health. We aimed to determine the prevalence of late per-
sistence of EBOV RNA in the semen of EVD survivors beyond 
2 years from the onset of acute illness using an assay validated 
in West Africa to detect EBOV RNA in semen.
METHODS
Men age 18 years and older participating in a longitudinal 
cohort study of EVD survivors conducted at the Eternal Love 
Winning Africa Hospital in Monrovia, Liberia were recruited. 
Cohort entry required written documentation of prior EVD 
as evidenced by an ETU discharge certificate verified by photo 
identification. All participants provided written informed con-
sent for the semen testing described. Research protocols were 
approved by the Institutional Review Boards at the University 
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of Liberia.
Clinical history, physical examination, and collection of 
semen were performed every 3 months. The dates of EVD onset 
and ETU discharge were self-reported. For 7 participants who 
could recall the month but not the day of EVD onset, the 15th of 
that month was used. In an additional 6 cases, both the month 
and day of EVD onset were not recalled. To approximate the 
EVD onset date for these participants, the mean time from EVD 
onset to discharge from the ETU among the 142 participants

with both dates available was calculated (26 days) and then was 
subtracted from the ETU release date. None of the participants 
with EBOV RNA detected in their semen required imputation 
of EVD onset date.
Demographics, time from ETU discharge to enrollment, and 
reports of the new onset of symptoms including vision prob-
lems, hearing loss, arthralgias, myalgias, fatigue, and headache 
at the time of enrollment and new since discharge from ETU 
were compared between those with and without evidence of 
EBOV RNA in semen.
We assessed the distributions of all factors overall and strati-
fied by patient characteristics, including presence of Ebola RNA 
shedding in semen. For bivariable analyses, we contrasted fac-
tors using parametric and non-parametric tests, including the 
Student’s t, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney, Pearson’s χ2, and Fisher’s 
exact tests, as appropriate. Differences in means and medians 
were estimated using linear and quantile regression, respec-
tively. Relative risks and associated 95% confidence intervals 
were calculated. All P values were 2-sided, and <.05 was consid-
ered statistically significant. Analyses were performed in SAS 
software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Semen was collected in sterile containers, stored at 2–8°C, and 
transported within 24 hours to the Phebe Hospital Laboratory, 
Bong County, Liberia. Semen was tested for EBOV RNA within 
2 days of collection using procedures previously described [12]. 
In brief, the Cepheid Xpert Ebola Assay (Sunnyvale, CA) was 
used to detect Zaire EBOV total nucleic acid, targeting the 
glycoprotein (GP) and nucleoprotein (NP) genes. Test results 
were interpreted by the GeneXpert Dx System from measured 
fluorescence signals based on algorithms embedded within the 
assay software. Samples were considered positive if either tar-
get gene (GP or NP) was detected. During the validation study, 
there were no false positives among the 58 negative control 
semen specimens or 52 commercial controls tested.
RESULTS
From June 2016 to January 2017, 158 men with documented evi-
dence of prior EVD entered the survivor cohort, and 149 (94%) 
donated semen at least once. Among those who provided semen 
for EBOV RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, the 
median age at cohort entry was 32 years (range, 17–59), and the 
median time from self-reported onset of EVD symptoms to first 
and last semen donation was 681 days (range, 260–835) and 
786 days (range, 367–1016), respectively. To date, participants 
donated an average of 3 (range, 1–6) semen specimens. Of the 
149 men who have donated semen, 137 (92%) have provided a 
semen specimen more than 2 years (730 days) since EVD onset.
Ebola virus RNA was detected in the semen of 13 (9%) par-
ticipants who donated semen (Figure 1). In 11 (85%) of the 13 
men, EBOV RNA was detected in semen more than 2 years 
after EVD onset; the longest time from EVD onset to detectable 
EBOV in semen was 965 days. Detection of EBOV RNA was 
observed to be intermittent (a detectable PCR result preceded 
by an undetectable PCR result) in 8 of 13 (62%) participants 
who ever had a positive result, including 1 participant who

initially had 2 samples test negative followed by a third that 
tested positive (participant 12; Figure 1).
There was no significant difference in the time from ETU dis-
charge to first semen donation between men with EBOV RNA 
detected in semen and those whose semen never tested positive for 
EBOV RNA (median days 352 vs 368, respectively; P = .46). Male 
survivors with detectable EBOV RNA in semen were significantly 
older (median age 41.8 vs 31.2 years; P = .0004) and more likely to 
report vision problems but less fatigue compared with those whose 
semen tested negative (Table 1). There was no significant difference 
found in the proportion of men who reported headaches, hearing 
loss, numbness of hands or feet, muscle pain, or joint pain between 
those with or without EBOV RNA in semen.
DISCUSSION
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), men who 
survive EVD should undertake measures such as abstinence and 
the use of condoms to prevent potential sexual transmission of 
EBOV for at least 12 months after the onset of EVD symptoms, 
or until their semen has tested negative for EBOV RNA twice 
[13]. Our study of long-term Ebola survivors confirms earlier 
findings that EBOV RNA can be detected beyond 12 months 
after EVD and also extends the duration of seminal EBOV RNA 
detection beyond 2 years. We have also found that EBOV RNA 
is often intermittently detected when using a validated assay 
with a lower limit of detection approximating 1000 copies/mL.
Overall, these findings have a number of important impli-
cations. Foremost, although the persistence of EBOV RNA in 
semen is concerning, it is not known whether the detection of 
EBOV RNA in genital fluids is a surrogate for the presence of 
infectious virus. In a recent study, Sissoko et al [7] reported the 
retrieval of EBOV RNA in the blood and organs after the pas-
sage of PCR-positive survivor semen in a SCID mouse model. 
In that study, EBOV RNA was not detected in samples collected 
beyond 233 days after onset of EVD, but a report of sexual trans-
mission of EBOVs from a male survivor more than 500 days 
after the onset of his EVD illness suggests that infectious virus 
can persist beyond 1 year after acute Ebola infection. Further 
work to establish whether EBOV RNA detection correlates with 
the presence of infectious virus is needed to determine whether 
a diagnostic strategy based on PCR is sufficient to declare a 
survivor incapable of transmitting EBOV sexually. Meanwhile, 
the WHO recommendations regarding the prevention of sex-
ual transmission of EBOV should be updated to acknowledge 
that the duration of the presence of EBOV RNA in semen is not 
known and that the detection of Ebola viral RNA can be inter-
mittent even when tested using a validated diagnostic platform 
in accordance with Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute 
and Good Clinical Laboratory Practice guidelines.
Second, the demonstration of the persistence of EBOV RNA 
in the male genital tract for more than 2 years after the clear-
ance of viremia also requires a new approach to the study of 
this virus and its immunology. A comparison of the 13 men 
with EBOV RNA detected in their semen and the 136 without 
revealed important differences in age and post-EVD clinical 
sequelae. The finding that men with evidence of seminal EBOV 
RNA were significantly older than men without seminal EBOV 
RNA detected supports earlier findings from the US Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention and Liberian Ministry of Health 
Men’s Health Study, and it may suggest that aging and the associ-
ated immune senescence may enable penetration of EBOVs into 
immune-privileged sites such as the testes [8]. Likewise, men 
with EBOV RNA detected semen were more likely to report 
vision problems, supporting a hypothesis that both the eye and 
the testes are sites of immune privilege where viable virus may 
evade systemic immune responses. Two cases of recrudescent 
EVD involving the cerebrospinal fluid and 1 case of anterior 
uveitis with ocular hypertension further support the potential 
for viral persistence in these and other immune privileged sites 
[14, 15]. Further research into viral penetrance of immune privi-
leged sites and the role of aging and other host factors are needed 
to identify who is at risk of viral persistence, sexual transmis-
sion, and potentially recrudescent disease. In addition, the fac-
tors associated with EBOV persistence in semen must also be 
explored, including whether there is a differential in the neutral-
izing capability of antibodies in the circulation compared with 
the genital tract, the role of other immune deficiencies such as 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), as well as the potential 
role of sexually transmitted infections that are associated with 
increased HIV shedding in semen [16–19].

 4 • OFID • BRIEF REPORT
Finally, the impact of the potential for prolonged, intermit-
tent seminal shedding of EBOV on the lives of EVD survivors 
must be considered. For many survivors, the physical mani-
festations of the disease have been compounded by the stigma 
encountered with their return to their communities. Survivor 
messaging regarding viral persistence, if demonstrated, must 
provide information that can be used to protect loved ones but 
at the same time not risk further ostracizing by society.
In addition to the lack of clarity as to the infectiousness of 
semen with detected EBOV RNA, which will be addressed in 
subsequent studies, there are other limitations that should be 
considered when interpreting these results. Although a vali-
dated assay was used to assess for EBOV in semen, the lower 
limit of detection was approximately 1000 copies/mL, and con-
centrations of viral RNA below this threshold are less likely to 
be detected. Furthermore, at this point, we remain unable to 
determine the complete duration of seminal EBOV RNA per-
sistence because we have yet to observe a prolonged absence of 
detection of viral RNA in the semen of men participating in this 
ongoing, longitudinal cohort study.
CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, EBOV RNA can be detected in the semen of 
some survivors of EVD for over 2 years after the onset of their 
infection. This unexpected and prolonged presence of EBOV 
RNA in the male genital tract should prompt discussion of 
revised approaches to the prevention of sexual transmission 
of Ebola and encourage novel investigations to determine the 
mechanisms by which this virus remains in this and other com-
partments, its infectiousness, and strategies for its elimination. 
Such data are necessary to inform public health recommenda-
tions that are used to counsel thousands of EVD survivors.
