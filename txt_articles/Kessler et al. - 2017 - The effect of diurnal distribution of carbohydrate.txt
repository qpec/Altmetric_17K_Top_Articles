Diurnal carbohydrate and fat distribution modulates glycaemic control in rodents. In humans, 
the optimal timing of both macronutrients and its effects on glycaemic control after prolonged 
consumption are not studied in detail. In this cross-over trial, 29 non-obese men were randomized to 
two four-week diets: (1) carbohydrate-rich meals until 13.30 and fat-rich meals between 16.30 and 
22.00 (HC/HF) versus (2) inverse sequence of meals (HF/HC). After each trial period two meal tolerance 
tests were performed, at 09.00 and 15.40, respectively, according to the previous intervention. On the 
HF/HC diet, whole-day glucose level was increased by 7.9% (p = 0.026) in subjects with impaired fasting 
glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IFG/IGT, n = 11), and GLP-1 by 10.2% (p = 0.041) in normal 
glucose-tolerant subjects (NGT, n = 18). Diet effects on fasting GLP-1 (p = 0.009) and PYY (p = 0.034) 
levels were observed in IFG/IGT, but not in NGT. Afternoon decline of glucose tolerance was more 
pronounced in IFG/IGT and associated with a stronger decrease of postprandial GLP-1 and PYY levels, 
but not with changes of cortisol rhythm. In conclusion, the HF/HC diet shows an unfavourable effect on 
glycaemic control in IFG/IGT, but not in NGT subjects. Consequently, large, carbohydrate-rich dinners 
should be avoided, primarily by subjects with impaired glucose metabolism.
The control of diurnal glucose fluctuations is a crucial component of body homeostasis. Nutritional approaches 
are corner stones to achieving euglycaemia in diabetes and health. Today, the best dietary strategy remains 
unclear. The benefits of wholegrain, fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes have been widely recognized1. However, 
recently published studies suggest that meal timing and daily eating patterns help prevent metabolic diseases2,3, 
pointing towards a pivotal role of circadian rhythms in metabolism4.
Circadian rhythms are self-sustained ~24 h rhythms in behaviour, physiology and metabolism that allow 
organisms the adaptation to the daily recurring day-night cycles and resultant changes in food availability2. 
Consequently, numerous processes of glucose, cholesterol and lipid metabolism, detoxification pathways and 
immune responses5 display circadian oscillation.
Recent studies in rodents provide evidence that the timing of macronutrient consumption influences the cir-
cadian clock machinery and metabolism6–10. Under an ad libitum high fat diet, mice consume an abnormally high 
proportion of calories during the light phase (i.e. the sleep phase for nocturnal animals) which leads to increased 
adiposity and decreased glucose tolerance8. Remarkably, when the high fat diet was restricted to the active phase 
of day, mice were protected against obesity, hyperinsulinemia, hepatic steatosis and inflammation9. Similar results 
have been reported for liquid sugar and fructose intake11,12.

These observations support the hypothesis that consumption of fat and carbohydrates at certain time win-
dows within the active phase might beneficially modulate metabolic homeostasis13. Indeed, in mice a low-fat 
carbohydrate-rich diet at the end of the active phase led to reduced body weight and improved glucose tolerance; 
conversely, mice on a high fat diet at the end of the active phase showed glucose intolerance, adiposity and fea-
tures of the metabolic syndrome14,15. Intervention studies by Sofer et al. confirm the beneficial effect of carbohy-
drate consumption in the evening (end of the active phase)16,17. Eating carbohydrates mostly at dinner within a 
hypocaloric diet led to more pronounced weight loss, reduced hunger scores and improved metabolic status in 
obese subjects16. Similarly, carbohydrate consumption at end of the active phase resulted in the improved feeding 
regulation and amelioration of inflammatory parameters in mice17. An improvement of glycaemic control was 
also observed when carbohydrates were mainly eaten at dinner and protein mainly at lunch18. In contrast, epide-
miological studies propose a beneficial effect of a carbohydrate-rich diet at the beginning of the day: an increasing 
carbohydrate intake at the expense of fat in the morning was shown to be protective against the development of 
diabetes19 and metabolic syndrome20.
Interestingly, a range of studies showed that identical meals result in higher postprandial elevation of plasma 
glucose in the evening than in the morning in healthy subjects suggesting a diurnal variation of glucose tolerance 
during the investigation day21–23. In particular, Morgan et al. compared the metabolic effects of varying both 
dietary glycaemic index (GI) and the time at which most daily energy intake was consumed24. Consumption 
of an energy-rich meal in the evening led to significantly higher glucose and insulin response compared to its 
consumption in the morning. Markedly, this effect was most pronounced in the evening on a high GI diet, con-
firming that the quality of carbohydrates at a particular time of the day acutely influences glycaemic control 
throughout the day24,25.
Taken together, these studies suggest that time of day-dependent carbohydrate and fat intake alters metab-
olism both in rodents and humans. Thus the detection of the best time for carbohydrate (and fat) consumption 
in humans as well as the effect of a prolonged consumption of such diet for glycaemic control are of scientific 
and clinical interest. We therefore investigated the metabolic effect of four-week HC/HF diet (carbohydrate-rich 
meals in the morning and fat-rich meals in the afternoon) versus HF/HC diet (the inverse sequence of meals) 
in male subjects without diabetes. The primary objective of our study was to compare the effect of both diets on 
fasting and whole-day levels of glucose and glucose-regulating hormones. Our secondary objective was to analyse 
the effect of daily carbohydrate and fat distribution on diurnal variation in glucose tolerance. The main findings 
of this study are: firstly, the HF/HC diet shows an unfavourable effect on the glycaemic control in subjects with 
an impaired glucose tolerance, but not in subjects with a normal glucose tolerance; secondly, this effect could be 
explained by the stronger afternoon decline of glucose tolerance in subjects with impaired glucose metabolism.
Results
Study subjects, dietary compliance, and anthropometric parameters. 
In this cross-over trial, 
non-obese male subjects without diabetes were randomized to two isocaloric four-week diets: (1) carbohy-
drate-rich meals until 13.30 h and fat-rich meals between 16.30 h and 22.00 h (HC/HF) versus (2) the inverse 
sequence of meals (HF/HC) (Fig. 1). Within each diet energy intake was equally distributed between the morning 
and afternoon. Interventions were followed by 12 h investigation days with carbohydrate-rich (MTT-HC) and 
fat-rich (MTT-HF) meal tolerance tests (MTT), provided either at 09.00 or 15.40, according to the participant’s 
previous dietary intervention (Fig. 1).
Between January 2014 and July 2015, 32 men started the trial. Three participants dropped out 
(Supplemental Figure 1). 29 subjects (age 45.9 ± 
 2.5 years, body mass index (BMI) 27.1 ± 
 0.8 kg/m2) completed 
the trial. 18 subjects were normal glucose tolerant (NGT); 11 showed an impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or an 
impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (Table 1). Compared with NGT group, IFG/IGT subjects showed higher fasting 
triglyceride levels (p = 
 0.044) and a tendency towards an increased fasting glucose levels (p = 
 0.064) (Table 1). 
Chronotype distribution of study subjects is shown in Supplemental Fig. 2A.
Adherence to dietary plans was good, with very similar compliances for the HC/HF diet and the HF/HC diet. 
For the HC/HF diet, 12073.4 ± 
 442.3 kJ were consumed in the course of a day, consisting of 49.1 ± 
 0.7 energy 
percent (EN%) carbohydrates (CHO), 36.3 ± 
 0.7 EN% fat and 14.7 ± 
 0.2 EN% protein. For the HF/HC diet, 
11826.3 ± 
 415.1 kJ were consumed in the course of a day, consisting of 48.7 ± 
 0.7 EN% CHO, 36.7 ± 
 0.8 EN% fat 
and 14.6 ± 
 0.2 EN% protein. There was no difference between the two diets regarding energy intake, macronutri-
ent composition, amount of saturated fatty acids, fibre and starch as well as GI (Supplemental Table 1). A detailed 
fragmentation of the compliance for the morning part (06.00–13.30) and the afternoon part (16.30—22.00) is 
shown in Supplemental Table 1. No major problems consuming the prescribed foods were reported.
Despite of extensive dietary advice, body weight slightly declined after both diets (− 
0.7% for NGT on the HC/
HF diet, non-significant on the HF/HC diet and for IFG/IGT) without difference between the diets (Tables 2 and 3).
Fasting parameters in response to the HC/HF diet versus the HF/HC diet. 
After four weeks of 
intervention, both the HC/HF diet and the HF/HC diet reduced fasting levels of glucose, C-peptide, glucagon and 
lipid parameters (total, HDL and LDL cholesterol) in NGT subjects (Table 2). Similarly, fasting levels of glucose, 
C-peptide, and HDL cholesterol declined in IFG/IGT subjects (Table 3). For these parameters, no significant 
differences between the effects of the HC/HF and the HF/HC diet and between NGT and IFG/IGT groups were 
observed. Interestingly, fasting glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) levels showed a diet effect 
in IFG/IGT subjects (p = 
 0.009 and p = 
 0.034, respectively), but not in NGT subjects. Indeed, in the IFG/IGT 
group, the HC/HF diet induced a strong reduction of GLP-1 level by 45%, whereas no significant change after the 
HF/HC intervention was found. Fasting PYY also declined after the HC/HF diet by 4.5% and was not altered after 
the HF/HC diet (Table 3). In the NGT group, post-intervention fasting glucose dependent insulinotropic peptide 
(GIP) levels were higher after the HC/HF diet relative to the HF/HC diet, but its diet-induced changes did not

differ between interventions (Table 2). No effect on insulin sensitivity measured by HOMA-IR was observed in 
either of the groups (Table 2 and 3).
Whole-day levels in response to the HC/HF diet versus the HF/HC diet. 
To determine the effect of 
both diets on whole-day levels, integrated areas under the curve (AUC) over both MTT (AUCday) were calcu-
lated as described in Methods. Again, different diet effects in NGT and IFG/IGT subjects were found. AUCday 
for glucose was increased by 7.9% on the HF/HC diet compared with the HC/HF diet in IFG/IGT subjects, but 
not in NGT subjects (Table 4). Conversely, a 10.2% increase in whole-day GLP-1 was observed on the HF/HC 
diet in NGT subjects, but not in IFG/IGT subjects. On the HF/HC diet, AUCday for free fatty acids (FFA) was 
significantly increased in IFG/IGT subjects compared to NGT subjects (Table 4). Statistical analysis revealed no 
difference in diet-induced changes between NGT and IFG/IGT groups. Whole-day levels of other studied param-
eters (Table 4) including hunger and satiety scores (Supplemental Figure 3) showed no differences between the 
diets and NGT and IFG/IGT subjects.
Diurnal variation of the metabolic response to MTT-HC. 
To analyse the effects of both diets on the 
diurnal variation of glycaemic control, we compared postprandial responses of glucose and glucose-regulating 
hormones to the same meal (MTT-HC or MTT-HF) in the morning and in the afternoon in the NGT and IFG/
IGT group. For this, we defined the diurnal variation in a variable as Δ = afternoon value − morning value.
Analysis of the metabolic response to MTT-HC revealed an impairment of glucose tolerance in the afternoon. 
For glucose, postprandial peak and the incremental area under the curve (iAUC0-180) were markedly higher in 
the afternoon than in the morning. Importantly, afternoon increase of iAUC0-180 for glucose was much more 
pronounced in IFG/IGT subjects compared with NGT subjects (4.5-fold vs. 2.5-fold, respectively) (Fig. 2A). This 
suggests a stronger decrease of glucose tolerance in IFG/IGT individuals at the end of the day. Notably, after peak-
ing, glucose levels deceased rapidly after the morning meal, whereas in the afternoon glucose levels persisted and 
remained significantly higher (Fig. 2A).
For insulin, the meal-induced response was rapid and fast in the morning, with peak levels at 30 minutes, 
while in the afternoon, insulin secretion peaked later (approximately at 2 h). Yet, the overall insulin secretion 
(iAUC0-180) was increased in the afternoon only in IFG/IGT subjects (Fig. 2B). Early and overall indices of insulin

(arrows) were drawn and a 13C breath test (dotted arrows) performed.

secretion (iAUCins/glu 0-30 and iAUCins/glu 0-180) and Gutt index of insulin sensitivity were decreased in the afternoon 
both in NGT and IFG/IGT subjects without differences between groups (Table 5). C-peptide mirrored insulin 
levels (Fig. 2C) but showed no significant diurnal variation, neither did hepatic insulin clearance (iHIC) (Table 5).
The iAUC0-180 for glucagon was reduced in the afternoon without differences between NGT and IFG/IGT 
groups (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, GLP-1 secretion showed a pronounced afternoon decline only in IFG/IGT sub-
jects (Fig. 3C) (p = 0.188 for difference of Δ 
 between NGT and IFG/IGT). Similarly, postprandial PYY secretion 
also showed a trend for diminished afternoon levels only in IFG/IGT subjects (Fig. 4A) (p = 
 0.071 for difference 
of Δ 
 between NGT and IFG/IGT). Postprandial GIP decreased in the afternoon, but not significantly (Fig. 3B).

FFA response showed no significant diurnal variation (Fig. 4B), although afternoon iAUC0-180 for FFA was higher 
in IFG/IGT subjects (p = 0.044) because of the reduced early postprandial suppression.
Correlation analysis of diurnal differences revealed that, in NGT subjects, diurnal variation of glucose levels 
(Δ 
 iAUC0-180) positively correlated with insulin variation (r = 
 0.595, p = 
 0.009). Remarkably, in IFG/IGT subjects, 
glucose excursion (Δ 
 iAUC0-180) did not correlate with insulin, but correlated negatively with diurnal glucagon 
(r = 
 − 
0.709, p = 
 0.015), GLP-1 (r = 
 − 
0.809, p = 
 0.003) and PYY (r = 
 − 
0.845, p = 
 0.001) variation. Moreover, 
PYY decline correlated with a decrease in glucagon (r = 
 0.664, p = 
 0.026), GIP (r = 
 0.618, p = 
 0.043) and GLP-1 
(r = 0.845, p = 0.001) response throughout the day.
Analysis of gastric emptying revealed no significant diurnal variation although a trend towards slower gastric 
emptying in the afternoon was observed (Table 5).
Diurnal variation of the metabolic response to MTT-HF. 
As expected, postprandial glucose, insulin, 
and C-peptide levels were lower and postprandial glucagon, GIP, GLP-1, PYY and FFA levels were higher after 
the MTT-HF compared with MTT-HC. As for MTT-HC, analysis of the metabolic response to MTT-HF revealed 
a decrease of glucose tolerance as the day progresses. In the afternoon, peaking of glucose levels was delayed and 
increased, and iAUC0-180 strongly increased in both NGT and IFG/IGT subjects without difference between these 
groups (Fig. 2A). For insulin, iAUC0-180 was significantly higher in the afternoon only in NGT subjects (Fig. 2B).

Both insulin and glucose rapidly decreased in the morning and remained elevated in the afternoon (Fig. 2A,B). 
For C-peptide, peak levels were delayed and increased, although the overall secretion was not dependent on the 
time of the day (Fig. 2C). In the afternoon, Gutt index showed an afternoon decline in both groups, which was 
significant only in NGT subjects (Table 5). Diurnal variation of insulin secretion index iAUCins/glu did not reached 
statistical significance (Table 5). iHIC decreased in the afternoon only in NGT subjects (Table 5).
Postprandial glucagon decline in the afternoon reached statistical significance only in IFG/IGT subjects 
(Fig. 3A). Postprandial GIP did also not decrease significantly (Fig. 3B). Similarly to the MTT-HC, GLP-1 and 
PYY secretion showed pronounced afternoon decline in IFG/IGT subjects (Figs 3C and 4A) (p = 
 0.188 and 
p = 
 0.083, respectively, for difference of Δ 
 between NGT and IFG/IGT). Postprandial FFA levels were higher in 
IFG/IGT subjects, but no significant diurnal variation was found in either of the groups (Fig. 4B).

Correlation analysis of diurnal differences for MTT-HF revealed that, in NGT subjects, diurnal variation 
of glucose levels (Δ 
 iAUC0-180) correlated with response variation of insulin (r = 
 0.738, p < 
 0.001) and gluca-
gon (r = 
 − 
0.556, p = 
 0.020); and insulin and glucagon variations were associated with each other (r = 
 − 
0.568, 
p = 
 0.17). In IFG/IGT subjects, glucose variation correlated positively with diurnal insulin pattern (r = 
 0.745, 
p = 0.008).
Diurnal variation of cortisol levels on the HC/HF diet versus the HF/HC diet. 
Because the impair-
ment of the glycaemic control in the evening is related to the cortisol rhythm26, we analysed diurnal variation 
of circulating cortisol level on both diets. As expected, cortisol levels were higher in the morning than in the 
afternoon (Supplemental Figure 2B). We observed no differences in diurnal cortisol variation (defined as Δ 
) 
between diets and between NGT and IFG/IGT subjects (Table 5, Supplemental Figure 2B). Moreover, no correla-
tion of diurnal cortisol variation with afternoon increase of iAUC0-180 for glucose and insulin and with afternoon 
decrease of insulin sensitivity (defined as Gutt index) was found.
Discussion
The present study is, to our knowledge, the first human trial investigating the effect of a prolonged diurnal distri-
bution of carbohydrate and fat intake on glycaemic control. Surprisingly, we found different metabolic responses 
in subjects with different stages of glucose tolerance. The HF/HC diet shows an unfavourable effect on the glycae-
mic control in IFG/IGT subjects, but not in NGT subjects.
Indeed, in IFG/IGT subjects, whole-day glucose level was increased by 7.9% on the HF/HC diet, whereas in 
NGT subjects it did not differ between the diets. Notably, in NGT group, whole-day level of the incretin hor-
mone GLP-1 was increased by 10.2% on the HF/HC diet, which, however, was not accompanied by an increase 
in whole-day insulin level. A differential regulation between NGT and IFG/IGT subjects is further proposed by 
the differences in fasting parameters between the two groups. For NGT, none of the fasting parameters showed 
a diet effect suggesting a compensatory mechanism in healthy subjects27. However, IFG/IGT subjects showed a 
diet effect for fasting GLP-1 and PYY levels, suggesting that people with an impaired glycaemic control are more 
susceptible to a diurnal carbohydrate and fat distribution. Remarkably, in neither group, we observed a different 
effect of the high-carbohydrate and high-fat afternoon meal on fasting triglyceride and fatty acid levels, described 
previously28.
Our data on the unfavourable effect of the HF/HC diet on the glycaemic control in IFG/IGT subjects are in 
contrast to the results of the mouse study showing that a carbohydrate-rich diet at the end of the active phase led 
to improved glucose tolerance14. Our observation is of great clinical importance suggesting that the avoidance 
of carbohydrate-rich meals in the evening in people with impaired glucose tolerance should be recommended. 
In line with this recommendation are previous studies showing that an increasing carbohydrate intake at the 
expense of fat in the morning seems protective against the development of diabetes19 and metabolic syndrome20. 
Conversely, consumption of high GI food in the evening seems most detrimental for human health24.

To understand the mechanisms of the unfavourable effect of the HF/HC diet, we compared the effects of 
both diets on diurnal variation of glycaemic control. In our study, postprandial glucose responses were largely 
increased and delayed in the afternoon independent of meal composition, confirming the decline in glucose tol-
erance in the evening, as demonstrated in healthy humans by a range of previous studies21–23,29. Importantly, the 
evening decline of glucose tolerance was more pronounced in IFG/IGT subjects. We observed this phenomenon 
only for the high-carbohydrate meal, which could be explained by the larger postprandial glucose excursion that 
allowed detecting diurnal differences between morning and afternoon meal. Similar results were shown in an 
earlier study examining oral glucose tolerance tests in large cohorts in the morning (0930 h) and early afternoon 
(1300–1400 h)30. In this study, subjects with normal fasting glucose showed a small diurnal variation in their 
glucose tolerance, with less homeostatic control in their afternoon test, while subjects with mildly elevated fasting 
glucose showed an enhanced diurnal variation30. Recent studies confirm the progressive increase in 24 h glycae-
mic variability from NGT to IFG/IGT subjects31,32. Sonnier et al. showed that insulin resistant subjects suffered 
from a loss of rhythm in insulin sensitivity, which was partially compensated by an enhancement of the rhythm 
in insulin levels26. Two other studies found increased 24 h profiles of glucose and C-peptide in IFG subjects33 and 
first-degree relatives of type 2 diabetic patients34, with conflicting results regarding 24 h insulin levels.

The higher postprandial glucose response to the high-carbohydrate meal in combination with the worsened 
glucose tolerance in IFG/IGT subjects in the afternoon might explain the increase in whole-day glucose level, 
observed on the HF/HC diet in IFG/IGT subjects. These results are of great practical importance as they extend 
the current evidence on the favourable effect of high caloric intake in the morning over high caloric intake in the 
evening35,36. Eating the main meal early in the day may therefore be a beneficial strategy to counteract the after-
noon/evening impairment of glycaemic control.
Multiple mechanisms contribute to the reduced glucose tolerance in the evening13,37 including decreased insu-
lin sensitivity, elevated hepatic glucose production, and decreased β 
 cell function. In healthy humans, both insulin 
sensitivity and β 
 cell responsivity to glucose are reduced in the evening38 whereas the data on the diurnal hepatic 
glucose production are controversial22,39,40. Consistent with previous observations22,41, we found an increase in 
insulin resistance and a decrease in early insulin secretion in the afternoon.
Experiments with tissue-specific disruption of circadian rhythms in rodents have identified major roles of 
peripheral clocks in glucose homeostasis42,43. Protocols precisely controlling behavioural rhythms showed that 
the endogenous circadian time is a powerful determinant of glycaemic control in humans23. Multiple other factors 
modulate the rhythm of glucose tolerance in humans including sleep/wake cycle and daily variation of corti-
sol44, adrenocorticotropic hormone45, glucagon22 and incretin secretion21, gastric emptying, as well as fatty acid 
metabolism29.
In our study, the worsened glucose tolerance in IFG/IGT subjects in the afternoon was associated with a 
stronger decrease of postprandial GLP-1 and PYY secretion. Interestingly, for the high-carbohydrate meal, diur-
nal glucose variation did not correlate with insulin secretion changes, but correlated with declines in glucagon, 
GLP-1 and PYY secretion in the afternoon. Further, postprandial insulin levels were strongly increased in the 
afternoon in IFG/IGT subjects, and the diurnal insulin variation was not associated with pattern of glucagon, 
GLP-1 and PYY secretion. Notably, in NGT subjects this effect was not found, and glucose pattern correlated 
well with diurnal changes of insulin level. This suggests that in subjects with impaired glucose metabolism the 
decreased incretin response in the afternoon reinforced insufficient insulin secretion with consequences of higher 
postprandial glycaemic levels.
GLP-1 has previously been identified as a potent modulator of the diurnal variation of glycaemic control: 
Lindgren et al. show that early postprandial secretion of both incretin hormones, GIP and GLP-1, is increased 
in the morning compared to the evening, suggesting that the diurnal rhythm in GIP and GLP-1 levels might 
be one of potentially many mechanisms accounting for the increased insulin sensitivity in the morning21. The 
mechanism of the higher incretin responses in the morning is not known, and might be associated with diurnal

subjects (red).

variation of gastric emptying rate46 or vagal tone. In our study, we did not find a diurnal variation of gastric 
emptying rate although a trend towards slower gastric emptying in the afternoon was observed for the MTT-HC. 
Notably, we observed a marked afternoon decline of GLP-1 secretion (more pronounced in IFG/IGT subjects), 
but only moderate diurnal variation of GIP secretion. There has been a long-standing debate whether reduced 
GLP-1 levels are a “universal characteristic” of IFG/IGT and diabetic subjects47. Our data indicate that diurnal 
variation of GLP-1 levels might be modulated by the stages of glucose tolerance.
As GLP-1, PYY displays diurnal variation peaking at 1500 h and subsequently decreasing until the early morn-
ing48. Recent studies suggest that the stage of glucose tolerance affects PYY secretion with diminished postpran-
dial secretion in diabetic subjects49. As for GLP-1, our data propose that particularly the diurnal variation of PYY 
levels might be affected by the stage of glucose tolerance. Interestingly, a study in primates also suggests a diurnal 
variation of PYY effects: infusion of PYY reduced the initial rate of eating only during the morning meal, but not 
during the evening meal50. This phenomenon might explain why we did not detect a difference in hunger and 
satiety scores between NGT and IFG/IGT subjects in our study.
Further, our study revealed increased whole-day FFA levels on the HF/HC diet in IFG/IGT subjects com-
pared to the NGT subjects. Moreover, in the afternoon, iAUC0-180 was higher in IFG/IGT subjects after the 
high-carbohydrate meal than in NGT subjects. Elevated FFA levels are important players in the development of 
insulin resistance51 and diurnal variation of FFA response have been shown to contribute to the decline in glu-
cose tolerance as the day progresses29. However, some studies demonstrated no difference in daytime variations 
between NGT subjects and individuals with IGT33,34 and therefore this question requires further research.
The next possible mechanism which might contribute in the difference of diet effect in NGT and IFG/IGT sub-
jects is the alteration of cortisol rhythm. As a recent study found that weak cortisol rhythms are associated with 
greater evening declines in glucose tolerance in prediabetic subjects26, we further investigated the possible contri-
bution of this mechanism to the difference in diet effect in NGT and IFG/IGT subjects. Hydrocortisone infused 
at 1 pm (elevated at abnormal time) versus 5 am (elevated at normal time) results in increased plasma glucose 
and insulin levels52. However, our study observed no differences in diurnal cortisol variation between diets and 
between NGT and IFG/IGT subjects. Moreover, no correlation of diurnal cortisol variation with evening increase 
of glucose and insulin levels and decrease of insulin sensitivity was found. Thus, our study could not confirm that 
the cortisol rhythms contribute to the differences in the diurnal variation in glucose tolerance between NGT and 
IFG/IGT subjects as described previously26.
Finally, strengths and limitations of the current study should be mentioned. The current study has the strength 
of being a randomized controlled trial with well-defined participants, which is only possible in small-scale stud-
ies. Secondly, the duration of our dietary interventions (i.e. four weeks) should be highlighted, as previous reports 
on a diurnal carbohydrate and/or fat distribution focused on the effect of short-term interventions. Finally, in the 
current study the macronutrient composition was altered without changing energy intake, by distributing the 
calories equally between the eating occasions (morning versus afternoon part). However, some limitations need 
to be addressed. Firstly, in spite of extensive nutritional counselling and thoughtful designing of dietary plans, 
both diets led to a minor weight loss. Possibly, the weight reduction was a reflection of the fact that the partici-
pants did not report their true intake in the weighed food records, which is a common problem in human stud-
ies53. However, the cross-over design of the study should minimize any potential effect of the weight reduction. 
Secondly, although the overall composition of both diets were very similar and did not show differences in macro-
nutrient composition, fibre and starch content as well as GI, there were minor differences between the fat-rich and 
carbohydrate-rich diet in the morning versus evening, and we cannot completely exclude that this may influence 
the results of our study. Thirdly, we cannot completely exclude a contribution of the second-meal phenomenon 
to the regulation of meal-induced insulin and incretin response in the afternoon54. However, the time between 
MTT1 and MTT2 was long enough (~7 h) to minimize this effect. Finally, our study was conducted in overweight 
healthy individuals and we cannot exclude that our diets would induce other effects on the glycaemic control 
in people with obesity and type 2 diabetes. In obese people, it was reported that diurnal variation in glycaemic 
control was absent55. In diabetic patients, the 24 h profile of plasma glucose is impaired and characterized by 
hyperglycemia in the morning (dawn phenomenon) which is particularly caused by an elevated hepatic glucose 
production and corresponding increased early morning insulin requirements56. In other studies, a loss of diurnal 
variation after oral glucose administration was described30 as well as a time of day-dependence with the highest 
tolerance at lunch time57. Thus, in diabetic patients, results are controversial30,57 and require further research.
In conclusion, the present study reveals an unfavourable effect of the HF/HC diet on glycaemic control in IFG/
IGT subjects, but not in NGT subjects. Consequently, considering the impairment of glucose tolerance as the day 
progresses, large, carbohydrate-rich dinners may potentially need to be avoided, primarily by individuals with an 
impaired glycaemic control.

Study design. 
The cross-over study included two four-week dietary intervention periods separated by a 
washout phase of 31 ± 
 2 days (Fig. 1). Details on the randomization are stated in Supplemental Methods. The 
HC/HF diet consisted of isocaloric carbohydrate-rich breakfast and lunch (65 EN% CHO, 20 EN% fat, 15 EN% 
protein) and fat-rich snack and dinner (35 EN% CHO, 50 EN% fat, 15 EN% protein). The HF/HC diet consisted 
of the reversed order of meal composition.
Dietary interventions. 
For each participant, weighed food records for five consecutive days were ana-
lysed with PRODI 6.1 expert software (Nutriscience, Stuttgart, Germany) to determine food preferences and 
mean caloric intake. To ensure a good compliance, individual dietary plans were formulated for each partic-
ipant meeting the macronutrient composition of both diets and considering the individual food preferences 
(Supplemental Tables 2 and 3). As well as possible, dietary plans were controlled for the amount of saturated 
fatty acids, starch and fibre as well as GI. Dietary plans were isocaloric with the product of the individual resting 
metabolic rate and the physical activity level and adjusted to the mean daily intake of the food record. Calories 
of dietary plans were evenly distributed between morning (breakfast + 
 lunch) and afternoon (snack + 
 dinner) 
leading to a daily macronutrient composition of 50 EN% CHO, 35 EN% fat (14 EN% SFA) and 15 EN% protein.
Participants were instructed to eat breakfast and lunch by 13.30 and snack and dinner 16.30–22.00. Cut-off 
points were chosen according to usual eating times in Germany to allow a best possible compliance. During the 
run-in, intervention, and washout periods, participants were asked to avoid alcohol, maintain their normal cof-
fee consumption and follow their regular routine of wakefulness and sleep and physical activity levels. Munich 
Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ)58 was used to determine participants’ chronotypes, by determination of 
the mid-sleep time point on free days adjusted for individual average sleep need accumulated on work days 
(MSF-Sc). Activity levels were assessed at the end of each intervention using a pedometer (AS 50; Beurer Inc, 
Ulm, Germany)
Patient examinations. 
At all visits, anthropometrical measurements were performed after an overnight 
fast. Fasted blood samples were drawn from the forearm vein, centrifuged at 1800 g for 10 minutes 4 °C and stored 
at − 
80 °C until analysis.
At V2 and V4, two MTTs were performed in the course of the day, i.e. at 09.00 and at 15.40 (Fig. 1B, 
Supplemental Table 4). MTT-HC was rich in carbohydrates (64.8 EN% CHO, 20.3 EN% fat, 14.8 EN% protein) 
and contained 835 kcal; MTT-HF was rich in fat (35.3 EN% CHO, 49.6 EN% fat, 15.1 EN% protein) and con-
tained 849 kcal. The chronological order of the MTTs depended on the participant’s previous dietary intervention. 
Participants ingested the meals within 15 minutes. Blood samples were taken before (− 
5 minutes) and 30, 60, 
90, 120 and 180 minutes after completion of each meal. A 13C-acetate breath test was performed along with each 
MTT to determine gastric emptying rate (Supplemental Methods). Satiety and hunger scores were assessed before 
(− 
5 minutes), immediately after (0 minutes) and 180 minutes after each meal as described before59. Cortisol levels 
were determined before and 180 minutes after each meal.
Sample analyses. 
Routine laboratory markers were measured using standard methods (ABX Pentra 400; 
HORIBA, ABX SAS, France). Commercial ELISA were used for measurement of insulin, C-peptide, gluca-
gon (Mercodia, Sweden), GIP, total PYY (Merck Chemicals GmbH, Germany) and cortisol (IBL Internation, 
Germany) in serum; active GLP-1 was measured by Meso Scale Discovery assay (USA). For measurement of 
glucagon, GIP and GLP-1, EDTA plasma with 100 μ 
M DPPIV inhibitor and 500 KIU/ml aprotinin were used.
Sample size and power calculation. 
Power calculation was completed using the nQuery Advisor 6.0. 
For the paired parametric design and the sample size of 28 subjects, the current study provided 80% power to 
detect 5% difference between groups, if the effect size was 0.55. To allow discontinuation, 32 participants started 
the trial.
Calculations and statistical analyses. 
Dietary GI was calculated as described previously60. GI values of 
foods consumed were obtained from the DioGenes database60.
Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS v.20 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). To estimate the effects of dietary treat-
ments on anthropometrical and fasting metabolic parameters, changes from baseline (week 4 – week 0, in percent 
to baseline) were calculated. They were used as dependent variables in a linear mixed-effects model with treat-
ment (HC/HF or HF/HC diets), period (first or second) and residual effect of the first experimental period over 
the second period as fixed factors, and subjects included as a random factor61. In an additional analysis, weight 
change from baseline was included in the linear mixed model as a covariate. Sampling distribution was analyzed 
using Shapiro-Wilk test. Not normally distributed data were log-transformed before analysis. The same model 
was used for parameter levels at the start (week 0) and at the end (week 4) of intervention. Because no effect of the 
period and no residual effect were observed for any measured variable, for following analyses data were pooled 
in HC/HF and HF/HC groups.
For FFA, glucose and meal-induced hormone secretion, areas under the curve (AUC) and incremental AUC 
(after subtraction of the baseline area, iAUC) were determined by trapezoidal method. Integrated AUC of both 
meal tolerance tests (AUCday) were calculated for analysis of whole-day levels. To compare MTTs in the morning 
and in the afternoon, iAUC were calculated for the total (0–180 min) responses. For fasting whole-day levels, dif-
ferences between NGT and IFG/IGT subjects were calculated as the delta percentage (Δ 
% = 
 (new value − 
 basal

value)/basal value * 100). For the comparison between morning and afternoon meal, diurnal variation in a varia-
ble was calculated as Δ = afternoon value – morning value.
Insulin secretion was assessed as the ratio of iAUC for insulin to iAUC for glucose (iAUCins/glu). Insulin sensi-
tivity in MTT was determined by the Gutt index (ISI Gutt0-120)62. Hepatic insulin clearance (HIC) was calculated 
as ratio of iAUC0-180 for C-peptide to iAUC0-180 for insulin63. HOMA-IR was calculated according to following 
equation. HOMA-IR [mmol * mU * L2] = glucose [mmol/L] × insulin [mU/L]/22.5, using fasting values.
For markers of satiety and hunger scores, daily levels were calculated as the average level from six time points 
of data collection.
Time-of-day and diet effects were estimated using two-way repeated measures ANOVA. Comparisons 
between two groups at each time point were performed using paired Student’s t-test or Wilcoxon test, and corre-
lations were calculated using Pearson or Spearman tests, depending on sample distribution. P values < 0.05 were 
considered significant in all analyses. All data are presented as means ± SEMs.
