Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that predominantly circulates between
humans and Aedes mosquitoes. Clinical studies have shown that Zika viruria in patients
persists for an extended period, and results in infectious virions being excreted. Here, we
demonstrate that Aedes mosquitoes are permissive to ZIKV infection when breeding in urine
or sewage containing low concentrations of ZIKV. Mosquito larvae and pupae, including from
field Aedes aegypti can acquire ZIKV from contaminated aquatic systems, resulting in ZIKV
infection of adult females. Adult mosquitoes can transmit infectious virions to susceptible
type I/II interferon receptor-deficient (ifnagr-/-) C57BL/6 (AG6) mice. Furthermore, ZIKV
viruria from infected AG6 mice can causes mosquito infection during the aquatic life stages.
Our studies suggest that infectious urine could be a natural ZIKV source, which is potentially
transmissible to mosquitoes when breeding in an aquatic environment.

 Z
ika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus belonging to
the genus Flavivirus and is transmitted to humans by
mosquitoes of the genus Aedes. Both Aedes aegypti and
Aedes albopictus are the primary vectors for ZIKV transmission
in nature1,2. Recent ZIKV epidemics in the Americas resulted in
more than 223,000 confirmed cases until the end of 20173. Several
neurological complications, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome
in adults4, and microcephaly in neonates5, are associated with
ZIKV infection. As a mosquito-borne flavivirus, ZIKV is well
known to survive in a transmission cycle between mosquitoes and
humans6. After transmission by infected mosquitoes feeding on
naive hosts, ZIKV rapidly develops viremia, which enables
acquisition by other mosquitoes via a blood meal. The virus
subsequently infects the midgut epithelial cells and systemically
invades other tissues, such as the salivary glands. Consequently,
the infected mosquitoes transmit the virus to another host
through blood feeding. In addition to causing viremia in host
blood, ZIKV has also been isolated from host semen, urine, saliva,
amniotic fluid, breast milk, and cerebrospinal fluid7–10. Trans-
mission of ZIKV has also been suggested to occur via other
nonvector approaches, such as sexual, congenital transmission,
and blood transfusions11–13.
Accumulating evidence indicates that infectious ZIKV particles
are excreted into urine14–16. To date, at least five ZIKV infectious
strains have been recovered and cultured from human urine
samples14,16–19, demonstrating that infectious ZIKV is discharged
by patient viruria. Another study reports an infectious ZIKV titer
of 10 pfu/ml in the urine of a patient14. In addition, ZIKV viruria
may persist for several days. The equivalent of 12–20 pfu/ml
ZIKV was present in urine samples from three patients from 5 to
26 days after the onset of Zika symptoms20. Indeed, an adult may
urinate 1000–2000 ml daily and, if infected by ZIKV, discharge
infectious ZIKV into the environment, including sewers, water
pools, septic tanks, or other artificial containers around human
dwellings. In a disease-outbreak scenario, many infected indivi-
duals (with or without symptoms) may intensively discharge a
large volume of infectious urine into a restricted aquatic habitat of
mosquitoes. We therefore investigated whether the urine from
Zika patients could be a ZIKV source that facilitates mosquito
infection in aquatic stages, and thus enables viral transmission.
In this study, we demonstrate that both A. aegypti and A.
albopictus are permissive to ZIKV infection when breeding in
urine or sewage containing low concentrations of ZIKV. ZIKV
viruria from infected AG6 mice leads to mosquito infection
during breeding. Furthermore, female field A. aegypti breeding in
infectious sewage can transmit infectious Zika virions to naive
AG6 mice, suggesting that ZIKV in contaminated aquatic
environments is transmissible by mosquitoes during breeding.
Results
Mosquitoes are permissive to ZIKV infection when breeding.
Both A. aegypti and A. albopictus, which live around human
dwellings, are major vectors for ZIKV transmission21. These
Aedes species commonly breed in containers with clean water
such as tree holes, flower pots, and tires. However, accumulating
evidence
from
field
surveillance
convincingly
shows
that
A. aegypti and A. albopictus tend to oviposit and breed in was-
tewater with low dissolved oxygen and high turbidity, such as
cesspits, septic tanks, and sewers (Supplementary Table 1).
Notably, immature forms of A. aegypti have been widely found in
raw sewage during dengue epidemics in Brazil22. The population
of adult A. aegypti mosquitoes emerging from wastewater may be
equal or even larger than those from traditional breeding sites
(clean water) in Brazil23 and Puerto Rico24. We therefore won-
dered whether mosquitoes might acquire ZIKV while breeding in
aquatic conditions with human urine containing infectious ZIKV.
We first assessed ZIKV stability in human urine. To mimic the
conditions in the human bladder, we incubated ZIKV with eight
fresh human urine samples (PRVABC59 strain, final titer was 1 ×
105 pfu/ml) and incubated ZIKV with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) as a control. The mixture was then maintained at 37 °C
(human physiological temperature) for 48 h. Interestingly, ZIKV
survivability varied significantly between individual urine sam-
ples. A titer of ZIKV (>102 pfu/ml) was detected in two samples at
24 h at 37 °C (Fig. 1a). To mimic the natural post-excretion
conditions, we incubated ZIKV with the same eight fresh human
urine samples (PRVABC59 strain, final titer was 20 pfu/ml).
Incubation of ZIKV with PBS served as a control. The mixture
was then maintained at 28 °C for 48 h. A titer of ZIKV was
detected in one sample at 24 h at 28 °C using a plaque assay
(Fig. 1b). This result suggests that the extended stability of ZIKV
in human urine in the environment may provide a time window
for ZIKV infection during mosquito breeding.
We next investigated whether the mosquitoes that breed in
infectious urine might acquire ZIKV. We first assessed the
susceptibility of larval and pupal stages to ZIKV infection in
aquatic conditions. The fresh urine from Donor 3 (Fig. 1a) was
mixed with ZIKV supernatant from infected Vero cells for A.
aegypti larvae and pupae breeding (PRVABC59 strain, final titer
was 20 pfu/ml). After exposure to ZIKV urine, the larvae or pupae
were transferred to a new container with fresh water until
eclosion (Supplementary Fig. 1a). The emerging adult mosquitoes
were reared for 8 days for ZIKV detection by quantitative reverse
transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). Intriguingly, both the larvae and
pupae in the ZIKV urine were permissive to ZIKV infection
and carried ZIKV throughout development to adults (Supple-
mentary Fig. 1b). Notably, the mosquitoes emerging from pupae
incubation presented the highest prevalence of ZIKV infection,
suggesting that the pupae might be more susceptible to ZIKV
in urine.
Both A. aegypti and A. albopictus have been shown to carry and
transmit ZIKV in several field surveillance reports1,2. We next
investigated whether the different mosquito species breeding in
human urine with ZIKV might acquire an infection. In the first
experiment, we incubated the pupae of either A. aegypti
(Rockefeller strain) or A. albopictus (Jiangsu strain) with the
ZIKV-positive urine, in which the final ZIKV titers were 20, 2,
and 0.2 pfu/ml (Fig. 1c). The pupae of the two mosquito species
emerged in human urine (Donor 3) (Supplementary Fig. 2a). The
adult mosquitoes were reared for 8 days and subjected to ZIKV
detection by RT-qPCR. For the A. aegypti Rockefeller strain, 3.7%
(8/215) and 2.7% (4/147) of mosquitoes in the adult stage,
breeding in 20 and 2 pfu/ml ZIKV urine, respectively, were
positive for ZIKV by RT-qPCR detection. However, none of the
mosquitoes (0/129) acquired the infection from human urine
with 0.2 pfu/ml ZIKV (Fig. 1d). Additionally, 2.7% (6/223) and
0.7% (1/149) of adult A. albopictus mosquitoes breeding in 20 and
2 pfu/ml ZIKV urine, respectively, showed positive detection of
ZIKV (Fig. 1e). We next tested the infectivity of ZIKV virions in
mosquitoes breeding in ZIKV urine. In human urine with 20 pfu/
ml ZIKV, 2 of 50 A. aegypti pools (10 mosquitoes per pool) and
1 of 93 A. albopictus pools were positive for infectious ZIKV, as
determined by ZIKV culture in Vero cells. However, under
similar experimental conditions with 2 pfu/ml ZIKV, 1 of 65
A. aegypti pools was positive for the infectious virions, while no
infection was detected from a total of 100 pools of A. albopictus
(Table 1). The infectious supernatant was further subjected to
viral sequencing to confirm that the cytopathic effects were
caused by ZIKV infection. Thus, we demonstrate that different
Aedes mosquito species are susceptible to ZIKV infection when
breeding in infectious aquatic systems.

 We next assessed whether mosquitoes breeding in ZIKV urine
could transmit ZIKV to a naive host. A mosquito-mouse-
mosquito transmission model has previously been used for a
ZIKV transmission study25. We first reared the pupae of the A.
aegypti Rockefeller strain in urine with 20 pfu/ml ZIKV. Eight
days
after
the
adults
emerged,
twenty
female
A.
aegypti
mosquitoes were allowed to feed on a type I/II interferon (IFN)
receptor-deficient (ifnagr−/−) C57BL/6 (AG6) mouse, which is
an established animal model for ZIKV infection25 (Fig. 2a).
Notably, 3 out of the 17 mice exposed to infected mosquitoes were
ZIKV-positive by RT-qPCR detection at least one day post
infection (Fig. 2b). The infectious ZIKV particles were also
detected at the viremic peak by a plaque assay (Fig. 2c). We next
validated this phenomenon with a field-derived A. aegypti strain,
which was collected from the ZIKV epidemic area of Paraiba,
Brazil. RT-qPCR revealed that 2.3% (6/258) and 1.6% (3/191) of
emerged adult mosquitoes (Brazil Paraiba strain), which bred in
either 20 or 2 pfu/ml ZIKV urine, respectively, were positive for
ZIKV (Fig. 2d). Subsequently, the emerged female A. aegypti
mosquitoes were fed on the AG6 mice with the same experimental
procedure as used for the Rockefeller strain (Fig. 2a). One out of
14 mice exposed to infected mosquitoes developed robust viremia
from 1 to 7 days post feeding (Fig. 2e, f). This infected mouse died
at 10 days post feeding, indicating efficient ZIKV transmission by
the mosquitoes breeding in the ZIKV urine.
We next assessed this transmission route for other arboviruses.
In contrast to ZIKV, Dengue virus 2 (DENV2) rapidly lost its
infectivity in fresh human urine at 37 °C (Supplementary Fig. 3a).
A previous study reported the existence of DENV2 RNA in urine
discharged from a patient with dengue fever26. Intriguingly, 2 of
109 A. aegypti mosquitoes (the Rockefeller strain) acquired
DENV2 infection during pupae breeding (Supplementary Fig. 3b).
We tried to isolate infective DENV virions from mosquitoes
breeding in urine containing DENV2 using the same experi-
mental procedure as in Table 1. However, no positive samples
were identified from 50 mosquito pools (10 mosquitoes per pool).

 In addition, both the Batai virus (BATV, Orthobunyavirus)
and Sindbis virus (SINV, Alphavirus) showed stable infectivity
after 8 h of incubation at 37 °C (Supplementary Fig. 3c, e).
However, the Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes, which emerged
from pupae, failed to acquire BATV or SINV from the urine
(Supplementary Fig. 3d, f).
Clinical surveillance has shown a relatively low ZIKV viremia
(102–103 pfu/ml) in serum samples8,27,28, compared to that
of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Dengue virus (DENV).
Therefore, we assessed the vector competence of different
Aedes strains after oral feeding on a serial titration of ZIKV
(PRVABC59 strain). The mosquitoes were fed with human blood
(50% v/v) and supernatants from ZIKV-infected Vero cells (50%
v/v). The ZIKV load was determined from the midgut, the
head, and the salivary glands over a time course. The infection,
dissemination, and transmission ratios of these mosquitoes were
subsequently calculated accordingly. Intriguingly, acquisition of
human blood with 1 × 105 pfu/ml, but not 1 × 103–1 × 104 pfu/ml
ZIKV, resulted in a robust infection and transmission by the
A. aegypti Rockefeller stain, the A. albopictus Jiangsu strain, and
the A. aegypti Brazil strain (Supplementary Fig. 4).
ZIKV in sewage can be acquired and transmitted by mosqui-
toes. The prevalence of large ZIKV epidemics has faded. There
are a few Zika cases currently being reported in the Americas and
Southern Asia29,30. Therefore, we propose that it is impractical to
collect sewage samples from epidemic areas for the detection of
infectious ZIKV. As an alternative, we collected 10 sewage sam-
ples from different cesspit locations. The characteristics of these
sewage samples are shown in Supplementary Table 2. The pH
values of these sewages ranged from 7.45 to 8.35; the chemical
oxygen demand (COD) largely varied from 80 to 2300 mg/l;
and the amount of ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) ranged from
25 to 430 mg/l (Supplementary Table 2). Subsequently, we tested
the viral survivability in these sewage samples. The viral survi-
vability in the samples was measured by a time-course plaque
assay. With 1 × 105 pfu/ml of initial viral titer at 28 °C, one
sample, with the highest amount of COD and NH3-N (Sample
#10), had completely inactivated ZIKV at the first time point
of detection (1 h), while the virus in the other samples
partially survived until 1 h (Sample #9) or 8 h (Samples #7 and
#8) post incubation. The virus survived up to 192 h in the rest
of the samples (Fig. 3a). Nonetheless, the previous literature
indicates that the number of infectious ZIKV particles discharged
in patient urine might be 10–20 pfu/ml14,20. We therefore
utilized 20 pfu/ml as the initial viral titer to further assess the
ZIKV stability in these sewage samples. Consistently, the samples
with high concentrations of COD and NH3-N (Samples #7, #8,
#9, and #10) completely inactivated the viruses within 30 min

 post incubation, while ZIKV maintained its survivability for more
than 3 h in Samples #1 to #5 (Fig. 3b). We propose that the COD
and NH3-N concentrations in cesspit liquids may act as a key
determinant for ZIKV survivability. These data indicate that
ZIKV can survive in sewage under certain conditions. In the
ZIKV epidemic area of America, the COD concentration of
sewage varies from ~ 88 to 1323 mg/l, the pH ranges from 6.61 to
8.5, and the NH3-N ranges from 5 to 192 mg/l, according to the
field surveillance literature (Supplementary Table 3). We there-
fore used sewage Sample #5 (COD: 462 mg/l; NH3-N: 85 mg/l;
pH: 7.62) to mimic the sewage of the epidemic regions for
mosquito breeding.

 In the scenario of urination by an infected individual, the
infectious
urine
might
be
discharged
into
a
septic
tank
approximately every 2–3 h because a person normally urinates
6–8 times per day. To closely simulate the natural urination
scenario, we continuously added either 1/10 or 1/100 dilution of
20 pfu/ml ZIKV urine to the sewage sample (Sample #5) at 3 h
intervals (Fig. 3c). For continuous supplementation with a 1/10
dilution of 20 pfu/ml ZIKV urine, the viral titer was maintained at
~1–2 pfu/ml
(Fig.
3d).
However,
the
viral
titer
was
not
measurable by a plaque assay at a 1/100 dilution (the pfu was
<1). We then reared the pupae of a field-derived A. aegypti Brazil
Paraiba strain in these aquatic conditions. The pupae emerged in
the sewage successfully (Supplementary Fig. 2b). The emerging
adult mosquitoes were reared for 8 days before being subjected to
ZIKV detection by RT-qPCR. Intriguingly, 1.9% (4/206) of A.
aegypti adults, breeding in sewage with continuous supplementa-
tion of a 1/10 dilution of 20 pfu/ml ZIKV urine (maintenance of
1–2 pfu/ml ZIKV), showed ZIKV RNA positivity. Nonetheless,
none of the mosquitoes were ZIKV-positive by quantitative PCR
(qPCR) when breeding in a 1/100 ZIKV urine dilution (Fig. 3e).
Consistently, 1 out of 78 mosquito pools (10 mosquitoes per
pool) from the sewage with a 1/10 dilution of 20 pfu/ml ZIKV
urine was positive for the isolation of infectious ZIKV in Vero
cells (Table 2).
We next assessed whether the mosquitoes breeding in
infectious sewage could maintain the ZIKV transmission cycle
between hosts and mosquitoes. The pupae of an A. aegypti Brazil
Paraiba strain were reared in the sewage maintained with 1–2 pfu/
ml ZIKV. Eight days after adults emerged, 30 female A. aegypti
mosquitoes were allowed to feed on an AG6 mouse. Additionally,
the infected mouse was fed on by naive A. aegypti mosquitoes
throughout the viremic stage. After 8 days, the fed mosquitoes
were analyzed by RT-qPCR (Fig. 3f). Notably, 1 out of the 18
mice exposed to infected mosquitoes was ZIKV-positive by either
RT-qPCR (Fig. 3g) or plaque assay (Fig. 3h) after mosquito
feeding. The infected mouse (A. aegypti-BP-AG6-#26) died
11 days after mosquito feeding. Intriguingly, of the mosquitoes
that fed on the mouse with viremia from days 3 to 5, 10–100%
successfully
acquired
ZIKV
infection
(Fig.
3i).
Thus,
we
demonstrate that the field-derived A. aegypti mosquitoes from
the ZIKV epidemic areas can acquire ZIKV infection during
breeding in infectious sewage in natural settings and subsequently
transmit the infection to hosts by biting.
Mouse ZIKV viruria leads to mosquito infection. The stability
of ZIKV varied dramatically in different human urine specimens
(Fig. 1a, b). We next assessed key factor(s) that determine
ZIKV stability in human urine. We noted that the pH values
of human urine were correlated with ZIKV survivability; a
neutral or slightly alkaline condition favored ZIKV survival
(Table 3). Consistently, these ZIKV-hostile urine samples beca-
me favorable for ZIKV survival after their pH was adjusted to
modest alkalinity with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). In contrast,
decreasing the urine pH destroyed ZIKV viability (Fig. 4a). Using
a larger number of urine samples, we confirmed the correlation
of ZIKV stability with pH values (r = 0.8214, P < 0.0001,
linear regression with correlation coefficients (r) and significance
(p), Fig. 4b). Furthermore, a pH gradient assay demonstrated
that a pH above 6.5 rendered ZIKV stable in human urine
(Fig. 4c). Indeed, it is known that the flavivirus envelope (E)
protein
undergoes
irreversible
conformational
changes
at
acidic pH values below 6.5, which occurs naturally during
viral entry when the viral membrane fuses with the endolysoso-
mal membrane31,32. This structural change in the E protein
may lead to complete loss of viral infectivity by disabling
viral entry. Overall, the pH value of human urine determines
ZIKV
infectivity
and
likely
subsequent
transmissibility
to
mosquitoes.
We next exploited the AG6 mouse model and A. aegypti to
investigate
whether
ZIKV-contaminated
urine
could
infect
breeding mosquitoes. The pH in human urine varies from 4.5
to 8.0; however, mouse urine is usually more acidic, with a pH
lower than 6.533,34. ZIKV could not maintain its infectivity in
regular mouse urine (Supplementary Fig. 5). However, after the
pH value was adjusted to >6.5, the mouse urine was able to
maintain ZIKV infectivity (Supplementary Fig. 5). Next, we
infected the AG6 mice with ZIKV via intraperitoneal injection
(100 pfu per mouse) and subsequently treated the infected mice
daily with NaHCO333,35 (Fig. 5a). The AG6 mice developed high
viremia after infection (Fig. 5b). Consistent with the previous
literature, NaHCO3 treatment significantly elevated the pH value

 of the mouse urine (Fig. 5c). The urine pH of the NaHCO3-
treated mice started to decrease 3 days after infection, likely
due to severe morbidity of the infected animals (Fig. 5c).
Notably, there were almost no infectious ZIKV particles in the
urine
of untreated
infected
mice;
however,
30–120 pfu/ml
infectious ZIKV was observed in the urine of NaHCO3-treated
mice from days 3 to 6 post infection (Fig. 5d). The A. aegypti
pupae were then bred in 5-fold diluted urine excreted by ZIKV-
infected mice. The adult mosquitoes from pupae in the infected
mouse urine were reared for an additional 8 days for RT-qPCR
detection of viral loads. We found that 1.1–5.0% of the
mosquitoes were positive for ZIKV RNA (Fig. 5e), demonstrating
that ZIKV was transmitted from animals to mosquitoes via urine.
These results indicate that ZIKV might transmit between the
mosquitoes emerging from a ZIKV urine-contaminated water
source and humans (Fig. 5f).
Discussion
ZIKV is a blood-borne pathogen that is known to be transmitted
by infected mosquitoes. Although mosquitoes transmit ZIKV to
and acquire it from humans primarily through blood feeding, our
experiments mimicking natural settings demonstrate that mos-
quitoes may acquire ZIKV from human urinal discharge and
sewage during breeding. Our conclusions are supported by several
lines of laboratory evidence. First, ZIKV may survive for up to 8 h
in harsh environments, such as urinal discharge and sewage.
Second, both lab-adapted and field mosquitoes were infected
during hatching by ZIKV in the urinal and sewage environments
at concentrations as low as 1–2 pfu/ml. Third, the adult mos-
quitoes that hatched from ZIKV urine/sewage were capable of
transmitting ZIKV to mice and eliciting viremia. In favor of our
laboratory findings, recent clinical studies have shown the pre-
sence of 10–20 infectious ZIKV particles per ml of ZIKV patient
urine14,20. In particular, cesspits are still commonly used in areas
with recent ZIKV epidemics, including Brazil and the Pacific
islands22,36,37. Poor public sanitary infrastructure may have cre-
ated a physical environment for urinal ZIKV to be acquired by
mosquitoes. Nonetheless, these experimental studies attempting
to mimic natural settings cannot fully represent the natural sce-
narios in the field. The potential limitations in experimental
design, such as the number of urine and sewage samples, the
experimental parameter settings (temperature, incubation time,
etc.), and usage of animal models (mosquito species/strains,
mouse models, etc.), suggest that the laboratory conditions may
not comprehensively represent realistic conditions. Epidemiolo-
gical studies will be needed to prove human viruria-mediated
ZIKV infection in mosquitoes.
Our current result indicates that the maintenance of a low
ZIKV titer in sewage can cause the infection of adult mosquitoes
through breeding. The infected mosquitoes derived from the
infectious sewage can transmit ZIKV to a host by biting. In a

 disease-outbreak scenario, many infected individuals (with or
without symptoms) may intensively discharge a large volume of
infectious urine into a restricted aquatic habitat of mosquitoes.
We therefore speculate a scenario during a Zika outbreak in
which the accumulating ZIKV infectious particles discharged by
patients might be sufficient to facilitate the acquisition of an
infection by immature mosquitoes breeding in cesspit conditions,
thereby
establishing
the
host
urination-mosquito
breeding
transmission cycle. Interestingly, the emerging evidence indicates
that low-passage Aedes field mosquitoes from the Americas have
an unexpectedly low vector competence for ZIKV transmission
by oral blood feeding38. Compared to that of CHIKV and DENV,
clinical surveillance has shown a relatively low ZIKV viremia
(102–103 pfu/ml) present in human serum samples8,27,28. Intri-
guingly, the acquisition of human blood with 103–104 pfu/ml
ZIKV resulted in an inefficient infection and transmission by
both the lab-adapted and field-derived Aedes mosquitoes. Thus,
ZIKV viremia alone might not account for its rapid spread,
implicating that additional routes might contribute to the pre-
valence of mosquito infection in nature. Nonetheless, human
viremia titers reported in the previous literature may reflect
snapshot results of patients seeking treatment after symptom
onset. It is possible that these results may actually reflect off-peak
viremia.
A common concept is that Aedes mosquitoes mainly breed in
clean water. However, accumulating evidence indicates that both

 A. aegypti and A. albopictus have evolved to oviposit and breed in
wastewater with low oxygen and high turbidity. Notably, the
population of adult A. aegypti mosquitoes emerging from sewage
may be equal to or even larger than those emerging from tradi-
tional breeding sites (clean water) in Brazil23 and Puerto Rico24.
Nonetheless, the epidemiological importance of cesspit breeding
for ZIKV transmission remains unclear. Further field surveillance
is therefore needed to investigate the breeding behavior of these
Aedes spp. in cesspit conditions. In this study, we selected 28 °C
as a temperature parameter in our laboratory setting to mimic
the natural conditions. Indeed, the mosquitoes maintained in
the laboratory were routinely reared at 28 °C as a standard con-
dition25,39,40. The ZIKV epidemic area in Brazil located in
tropical regions, where the maximum daytime temperature
is 28.6–32.8 °C and the minimum temperature ranges from
20.5–22.3 °C at night41. We noted that the temperature setting at
28 °C might represent a realistic daytime condition in the ZIKV
epidemic area. Nonetheless, nighttime temperatures are also
essential for mosquito breeding and are likely to be substantially
lower. Therefore, both mosquito breeding and ZIKV stability
under various temperature conditions remain to be further
investigated.
ZIKV is well known to maintain a transmission cycle between
its hosts and mosquitoes primarily through mosquito blood-
feeding behavior. We report here that mosquitoes breeding from
a water system contaminated by ZIKV-containing human urine
can carry and transmit ZIKV. Our study suggests that mosquitoes
might acquire ZIKV not only through feeding on a viremic host25
but also through urine excreted by ZIKV patients. In addition to
ZIKV, the RNA of other flaviviruses, such as DENV26,42, yellow
fever virus43, and West Nile viruses (WNV)44 have also been
found in infected human urine. The presence of infectious par-
ticles has been detected in the urine of WNV patients45, sug-
gesting that other flaviviruses in human urine might also be
transmissible. The mosquito-borne flaviviral diseases widely
occur in the tropical and subtropical regions of developing
countries with a rudimentary sewer system and poor basic sani-
tation conditions46,47. ZIKV-containing human urine may con-
taminate the water systems where Aedes mosquitoes breed48. This
study offers laboratory evidence that ZIKV could be transmitted
to mosquitoes via human urine and provides a possible approach
for preventing the dissemination of mosquito-borne flaviviral
diseases by interrupting the ZIKV transmission cycle.
Methods
Ethics statement. Human urine was collected from healthy donors who provided
informed written consent. The collection of human urine samples was approved by
the local ethics committee of Tsinghua University.
Mice, mosquitoes, cells, and viruses. C57BL/6 mice deficient in type I and II IFN
receptors (AG6 mouse) were donated by the Institute Pasteur of Shanghai, Chinese
Academy of Sciences. The mice were bred and maintained in a specific pathogen-
free animal facility at Tsinghua University. All animal protocols used in this study
were approved by the IACUC (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee) of
Tsinghua University and performed in accordance with the IACUC guidelines. The
laboratory animal facility is accredited by the AAALAC (Association for Assess-
ment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International). Groups of age-
and sex-matched AG6 mice, 6–8 weeks of age, were used for the animal study.
The A. aegypti Rockefeller strain, the A. albopictus Jiangsu strain, the A. aegypti
Brazil Paraiba strain, and the C. quinquefasciatus Hainan strain were reared in a
low-temperature, illuminated incubator (Model 818, Thermo Electron Corpora-
tion, Waltham, MA, USA) at 28 °C and 80% humidity according to standard
rearing procedures25,49,50. The DENV2 New Guinea C strain (M29095), ZIKV
PRVABC59 strain (KU501215), BATV YN92–4 strain51, and SINV MRE-16 strain
(U90536.1) were grown in Vero cells for viral production25,49,52. The Vero cells
were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, C11965500BT,
Gibco), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (16000-044,
Gibco). The Vero cell line was purchased from ATCC (CCL81). The cell lines had
no mycoplasma contamination. All of the viruses were titrated by a plaque assay53.
Briefly, the titrated samples were added to 95–100% confluent Vero cells in 6-well
plates, and then incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 4 h. The wells were washed
with PBS, and subsequently overlaid with 2.5 ml of DMEM-agarose. After
5–6 days, the cells were stained with 1% crystal violet. The plaques were counted
for viral particle calculation.
Urinalysis. The characterization of human urine samples, such as the specific
gravity, clarity, and color, was measured by a Fully Automated Urinalysis System
(AX-4030, ARKRAY). The pH value of human urine was measured using a basic
pH meter (PB-10, Sartorius). The urinalysis results are summarized in Supple-
mentary Table 4. The mouse urine was discharged by abdominal pressing, collected
by micropipette, and transferred to a 1.5 ml tube for further investigation. The pH
value of mouse urine was measured by pH testing strips (90304, Macherey Nagel).
Sewage analysis. Both COD and NH3-N were measured in the sewage samples.
The COD value was detected by COD digestion vials (2125915-CN, HACH) and a
portable spectrophotometer (DR1900, HACH). The NH3-N was measured with
a Nitrogen-Ammonia reagent set (2606945-CN, HACH) and a portable spectro-
photometer (DR1900, HACH). The pH value of sewage samples was measured
using a basic pH meter (PB-10, Sartorius). The sewage characteristics are sum-
marized in Supplementary Table 2.
Mosquito infection by breeding in ZIKV-containing urine. Fresh human urine
from Donor 3 was mixed with ZIKV supernatant from infected Vero cells. The
mixture is named ZIKV urine hereafter. ZIKV urine was used for breeding the
pupae of A. aegypti (Rockefeller strain, Brazil Paraiba strain) and A. albopictus
(Jiangsu strain). After exposure to ZIKV urine, the larvae or pupae were transferred
to a container with fresh water until eclosion. The emerging mosquitoes were
reared for an additional 8 days for viral detection.
Viral genome quantitation by TaqMan qPCR. Total RNA was isolated from
homogenized mosquitoes using an RNeasy Mini Kit (74106, Qiagen) and reverse
transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) using an iScript cDNA Synthesis
Kit (170-8890, Bio-Rad). Viral genomes were quantified via qPCR amplification of
ZIKV, DENV, BATV, and SINV genes. The viral genomic copies were normalized
by a standard curve40. In each subsequent RT-qPCR plate sample, we quantified

mosquitos breeding from the water systems contaminated by ZIKV may acquire the infection. Therefore, viruria of infected hosts may facilitate ZIKV
prevalence and transmission by mosquitoes. b–e Source data are provided as a Source Data file

 four standard aliquot dilutions to adjust for threshold variation between plates. The
primers and probes used for this analysis are shown in Supplementary Table 5.
ZIKV detection and viral isolation from mosquito pools. The freshly emerging
pupae of A. aegypti and A. albopictus were reared in ZIKV urine. The freshly
emerging pupae of A. aegypti were reared in either human urine or sewage with
ZIKV urine. Eight days after emerging, ten adult mosquitoes were pooled and
ground in 400 µl PBS buffer (C10010500, Gibco). The homogenized mosquitoes
were then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then
filtered by a 0.22 µm filtration unit (SLGV013SL, Millipore) for culturing in Vero
cells. Total RNA was isolated from the infectious supernatant of Vero cells using an
RNeasy Mini Kit (74106, Qiagen) and reverse transcribed into cDNA using an
iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (170-8890, Bio-Rad). We amplified ZIKV fragments by
PCR. The PCR products were subjected to viral sequencing. The sequencing pri-
mers are shown in Supplementary Table 5.
Viral survivability in sewage samples. Human urine (Donor #3) with 20 pfu/ml
ZIKV (PRVABC59 strain) was added to the sewage (Sample #5) or PBS, as a mock
control, at either 1:10 or 1:100 dilutions. Urine with 20 pfu/ml ZIKV was con-
tinuously supplemented into sewage or PBS at 3-h intervals. The infectious sewage
or PBS was incubated at 28 °C. Viral survivability was determined at 1 h post ZIKV
supplementation via a plaque assay. Briefly, the infectious sewage was filtered by a
0.22 µm filtration unit (SLGV013SL, Millipore) to remove bacterial contamination.
We next used 5 ml of filtered infectious sewage to add into a well of 6-well plate for
a plaque assay. After 4 h of incubation with Vero cells, the infectious sewage
samples were removed and replaced with 2% DMEM (containing 1% agarose) for
5 days. The sample was measured twice.
Mosquito feeding on AG6 mice. The pupae of A. aegypti (Rockefeller strain) and
A. aegypti (Brazil Paraiba strain) bred in ZIKV urine. Eight days after adult
mosquitoes emerged, 20 emerged female mosquitoes were separated into a netting-
covered container for blood feeding. The mosquitoes were starved for 24 h before
blood engorgement. Six- to eight-week-old AG6 mice were anesthetized and placed
on the top of the containers. The mosquitoes were allowed to feed on the mice for
30 min in darkness. The blood samples were collected daily from the tail veins of
AG6 mice, and the viral genome was quantified via TaqMan qPCR amplification of
the ZIKV E gene. The number of infectious ZIKV particles in plasma at the viremic
period was determined by a plaque assay.
ZIKV transmission by mosquitoes breeding in sewage. Pupae of A. aegypti
(Brazil Paraiba strain) bred in the sewage with continuous supplementation of
ZIKV urine. Eight days after adult mosquitoes emerged, 30 emerged female
mosquitoes were separated into a netting-covered container for blood feeding. The
mosquitoes were starved for 24 h before blood engorgement. The 6–8-week-old
AG6 mice were anesthetized and placed on the top of the containers. The mos-
quitoes were allowed to feed on the mice for 30 min in darkness. Blood samples
were collected daily from the tail veins of AG6 mice, and the viral genome was
quantified via TaqMan qPCR amplification of the ZIKV E gene. The infectious
ZIKV particles in plasma during the viremic period were determined by a plaque
assay. Subsequently, the infected mice were fed on by naive A. aegypti on the
viremic day. The fed mosquitoes were reared for an additional 8 days for RT-qPCR
viral detection.
Infected AG6 mouse viruria model. AG6 mice (6–8 weeks) were infected by
ZIKV intrapleural injection (100 pfu per mouse). The infected AG6 mice were
administered 200 mM NaHCO3 solution in regular drinking water33,34. One hour
before urine collection, the AG6 mice were intragastrically administered 500 µl of
200 mM NaHCO3. Mouse urine was collected by abdominal pressing.
Determination of viremia in infected mice by a plaque assay. For viremia
detection, blood samples from the tail veins of infected mice were collected in 0.4%
sodium citrate and centrifuged for 5 min at 6000 × g and 4 °C for plasma isolation.
The presence of infectious viral particles in plasma was determined using a plaque
assay53. Briefly, the titrated plasma samples were added to 95–100% confluent Vero
cells in 6-well plates, and then incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 4 h. The wells
were washed with PBS, and subsequently overlaid with 2.5 ml of DMEM-agarose.
After 5–6 days, the cells were stained with 1% crystal violet. The plaques were
counted for viral particle calculation.
Statistics. Animals were randomly allocated to different groups. Mosquitoes that
died before measurement were excluded from the analysis. The investigators were
not blinded to the allocation during the experiments or to the outcome assessment.
No statistical methods were used to predetermine the sample size. Descriptive
statistics are provided in the figure legends. A Kruskal–Wallis analysis of variance
was conducted to detect any significant variation among replicates. If no significant
variation was detected, the results were pooled for further comparison. Linear
regression analysis was used to assess the correlation between ZIKV survivability
and the urine pH value in human urine. All analyses were performed using the
GraphPad Prism statistical software.
