Abstract  
 
Running is a popular and convenient leisure-time physical activity (PA) with a significant impact 
on longevity. In general, runners have a 25-40% reduced risk of premature mortality and live 
approximately 3 years longer than non-runners. Recently, specific questions have emerged 
regarding the extent of the health benefits of running versus other types of PA, and perhaps 
more critically, whether there are diminishing returns on health and mortality outcomes with 
higher amounts of running. This review details the findings surrounding the impact of running 
on various health outcomes and premature mortality, highlights plausible underlying 
mechanisms linking running with chronic disease prevention and longevity, identifies the 
estimated additional life expectancy among runners and other active individuals, and discusses 
whether there is adequate evidence to suggest that longevity benefits are attenuated with 
higher doses of running.

Regular physical activity (PA) prevents chronic diseases and reduces the risk of premature 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality.1,2 There is also some evidence indicating 
that vigorous-intensity aerobic PA (defined as any activity requiring an energy expenditure of ≥6 
metabolic equivalents [METs]) could be superior to moderate-intensity aerobic PA (3-6 METs) in 
reducing the risk of premature mortality.3–5 The United States (US) and World Health 
Organization (WHO) PA Guidelines recommend 150 min/week of moderate-intensity or 75 
min/week of vigorous-intensity aerobic PA (equal to ≥500 MET-min/week).6,7 However, self-
report data from the 2015 National Health Interview Survey indicate that only approximately 
50% of Americans obtain this minimum recommended amount of PA.8 This estimate drops 
dramatically, to 5-10%, using PA data collected via objective measures.9,10  
Running is among the most popular types of exercise and PA in individuals who do engage in 
vigorous-intensity PA.11,12 Running participation has grown throughout the past decade, and it 
peaked in 2013 when approximately 19 million individuals finished a road race of any 
distance.13  More recent reports from the 2015 race season indicated that there were 17.1 
million running participants, and the total number of road races increased by 2,300 between 
2014 and 2015, suggesting that running remains a popular leisure-time activity.13 Running is an 
attractive mode of exercise for many reasons. Compared with other types of vigorous-intensity 
sports and exercises, running mitigates many barriers to being physically active. Running is 
easily accessible and convenient since it does not require a gym membership or specialized 
equipment or training. Furthermore, even slow jogging is consistently considered a vigorous-
intensity PA, so it reduces the time commitment of exercise to reach the recommended levels 
of PA, which is often cited as the primary barrier preventing people from exercising.14,15

Moreover, mounting evidence suggests that running durations below the recommended 
guidelines of ≥75 min/week of vigorous-intensity PA offer substantial, and possibly maximal, 
protections against mortality.16,17 Running may confer superior benefits over other types of 
vigorous-intensity PA, since it is more strongly associated with lower body weights and smaller 
waist circumferences.18 Therefore, running may be an ideal exercise modality from both an 
individual and a public health standpoint.   
 
Longevity Benefits of Running 
There are several large population-based cohort studies, which have examined all-cause 
mortality and other health outcomes among runners compared with non-runners.17,19–22 
Overall, these studies found that after adjusting for age and sex, runners have 30-45% lower 
risk of all-cause mortality. After further controlling for smoking status, alcohol consumption, 
socioeconomic variables, body mass index (BMI), and other types of PA, the impact of running 
on reducing all-cause mortality remains substantial, reducing the risk of premature death by 25-
40%.   
 
Running is protective against both CVD and cancer, the two leading causes of death in 
most developed countries including the US.23 The risk of CVD-related mortality is reduced 45-
70% in runners compared with non-runners after adjusting for potential confounders.17,19,20,22 
Runners also have 30-50% reduced risk of cancer-related mortality compared with non-runners 
after adjusting for cofounders.20–22 Beyond CVD and cancer, there is additional evidence that 
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
5 
 
running may be protective against mortality resulting from neurological conditions, such as 
Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Disease, and respiratory infections.20   
Runners also tend to engage in other healthy behaviors that contribute to their 
increased longevity such as maintaining a normal body weight, not smoking, and consuming 
light-to-moderate amounts of alcohol.24 Most studies have adjusted their models to account for 
these confounders.17,19–22  However, there is evidence suggesting that it might be important to 
tease apart the effects of running on mortality relative to each of these covariates rather than 
simply controlling for them. We found that there was a greater mortality benefit in runners in 
both patient and healthy populations, smokers and non-smokers, and lean and overweight 
individuals in stratified subsample analyses of data from over 55,000 men and women aged 18-
100 years (Fig. 1).17 The mortality benefits of running were consistent regardless of age, sex, 
and alcohol consumption. In this large cohort, runners overall had 30% and 45% lower risks of 
all-cause and CVD mortality, respectively, compared with non-runners, after adjusting for a 
comprehensive set of potential confounders.

Figure 1 - Hazard Ratios of All-Cause and Cardiovascular Mortality by Subgroup. The reference 
group for all analyses is non-runners. Hazard ratios were adjusted for baseline age, sex (not in 
sex-stratified analyses), examination year, smoking status (never, former, or current. not in 
smoking-stratified analyses), alcohol consumption (heavy drinker or not. not in alcohol 
drinking-stratified analyses), other physical activities except running (0, 1-499, or ≥500 MET-
min/week), and parental cardiovascular disease (yes or no). Unhealthy was defined as the 
presence of one or more of the following: abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), hypertension, 
diabetes, or hypercholesterolemia. Heavy alcohol drinking was defined as >14 and >7 
drinks/week for men and women, respectively (Adapted from Lee et al.17).  
 
Is Running More Important for Longevity than other Lifestyle and Health Risk Factors? 
The WHO has reported that 6% of premature mortality is related to physical inactivity.25 
Another recent review indicated that physical inactivity causes 9% of all-cause mortality 
worldwide.1 Physical inactivity has been cited as the 4th leading global risk factor for death, 
especially in middle-to-high income countries, after high blood pressure (BP) (1st), cigarette 
smoking (2nd), and high blood glucose (3rd)25. Overweight/obesity and high cholesterol were 
found to be the 5th and 6th leading risk factors for death. All of these factors contribute to 
developing chronic diseases, such as CVD and cancer, leading to increased risk of premature 
mortality. Identifying and ranking risk factors provides public health policymakers with a 
quantitative estimate of the potential relative impact (i.e., proportional reduction in mortality 
that would be expected by interventions to reduce the risk factor of interest). Since running is 
one of the most popular and convenient leisure-time PA, it is informative to compare the 
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

relative contribution of running versus other risk factors on disease prevention and health 
promotion from a public health perspective.     
We have estimated the population attributable fraction (PAF) for running and other 
health risk factors to quantify their relative influence on mortality.17 Running was as important 
as hypertension (HTN) in the multivariable analyses, and more important than 
overweight/obesity or smoking as an attributable factor to prevent premature mortality in our 
sample. Running accounted for 16% and 25% of all-cause and CVD mortality, respectively (Fig. 
2). If all non-runners became runners in this population, 16% of all-cause and 25% of CVD 
mortality deaths would be prevented in the context of population-mortality burden.

predictor among mortality cases, and HRadj is the multivariable hazard ratio for mortality 
associated with the specified mortality predictor (Adapted from Lee et al.17).  
 
A possible limitation in this comparison is that running was measured by self-report, 
whereas other clinical risk factors such as BP and fasting glucose were measured objectively. 
Thus, there may be a measurement error in the running estimate due to recall bias and social 
desirability. To reduce this potential error, we also examined cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), a 
more objective marker for recent PA, that was obtained from a laboratory maximal treadmill 
test.26 The results were similar to our findings on reported running, and indicated that low CRF 
accounted for 16% of all deaths as the leading mortality predictor, followed by HTN, smoking, 
obesity, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes mellitus (DM). 
The consistent findings of the significant contributions of running and CRF on mortality 
outcomes underscore the importance of including PA and CRF assessments in routine medical 
examinations along with other clinical tests (e.g., BP and lipid profile). Running, as a key lifestyle 
medicine, could make a substantial public health impact on disease prevention and longevity.   
 
Potential Mechanisms Linking Running to Health Outcomes 
There are many purported mechanisms through which running may reduce premature 
mortality (Fig. 3).  Numerous epidemiological studies have reported associations between 
running/vigorous exercise and improvements in various chronic disease risk factors, including 
HTN, dyslipidemia, body composition, insulin sensitivity, blood glucose regulation, disability, 
bone mineral density, and CRF.27–30 Running/vigorous exercise may reduce some types of 
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

cancer-related mortality (e.g., breast and colon cancer) through its effects on body composition 
and female hormones (estrogen and progesterone in breast cancer).29 Dose-dependent 
associations have also been found between PA and improved cognitive function and reduced 
depressive symptoms,31–33 potentially reducing mortality related to some neurological or 
psychiatric conditions.

Notably, running may particularly benefit CVD mortality through its robust effects on 
CRF,34,35 which is generally better enhanced with vigorous-intensity PA.7,36 We found that every 
30 minutes of additional weekly running time was associated with 0.5 MET higher CRF after 
adjusting for age and sex.17 In fact, after further adjustment for CRF, mortality benefits of 
running were no longer significant.37 This implies that CRF mediates the relationship between 
running and reduced mortality. This potentially causal pathway is supported by previous 
findings indicating that CRF could be the strongest predictor of mortality.26 CRF has also been 
associated with increased gray matter volume in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, which 
could have important implications for neurological disease-related mortality.38  
A meta-analysis of 49 randomized, controlled trials (RCTs), conducted in 2,024 adults, 
found that running interventions, compared with inactive control groups, produced 
improvements in body composition, CRF, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), 
particularly with training durations greater than 1 year.39 Also, vigorous-intensity PA confers 
equal, if not greater, benefits than low- or moderate-intensity PA on BP (particularly diastolic 
BP), HDL-C, blood glucose control, insulin sensitivity, and CRF.28 Running may further improve 
certain CVD risk factors, such as adiposity and CRF, even after it is matched on energy 
expenditure with other types of vigorous-intensity PA.18 This may indicate that there is 
something inherent to running that is uniquely advantageous with regard to various health 
indicators.

There has also been growing interest in examining the effects of intermittent, high-
intensity interval exercise versus traditional, continuous exercise prescriptions.40 RCTs 
conducted in various populations, including CVD patients and obese individuals, have found 
that short duration, high-intensity interval training (typically cycling) produces similar 
improvements in body composition, blood lipids, insulin sensitivity, and CRF as continuous 
moderate-intensity exercise, but with significantly shorter exercise durations.40–42 There is also 
research in healthy individuals suggesting that interval running is just as effective as continuous 
running for some CVD risk factors, but with less than a third of the time commitment.43 Further 
research into the effects of interval running in deconditioned and/or patient populations is 
warranted, especially given that novice exercisers are often told to begin a walking-jogging 
program consisting of short bouts of jogging interspersed with walking. 
 
Is Running Better than Other Types of PA for Longevity?  
One of the most commonly asked questions regarding PA and health is simply, “What type of 
exercise or PA is the best for health?” Likewise, because running is so popular and convenient, 
people are often curious about whether or not running is better than other types of exercise or 
PA. We conducted a simple joint stratification analysis to address this question using the 
Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study (ACLS) data. We dichotomized both leisure-time running 
and other PA except running into two categories to simplify the complicated joint associations 
on mortality as well as to preserve adequate statistical power (Fig. 4). Individuals who were not 
runners and did not meet recommended guidelines (≥500 MET-min/week) through other PA 
(“Non-Runners” and “Inactive”) were the reference group. Runners who did not meet 
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
13 
 
recommended guidelines of other non-running PA (“Runners” and “Inactive”) had 30% lower 
risk of all-cause mortality (sole benefits of running). Non-runners who accumulated ≥500 MET-
min/week of other PA except running (“Non-Runners” and “Active”) had only a 12% lower risk 
of death (sole benefits of other PA except running). When we directly compared these two 
groups (running vs. other PA), we found that runners who were inactive in other PA had a 27% 
lower risk of death (HR=0.73; 95% CI=0.65-0.84) versus non-runners who were active in other 
PA. These results suggest that running may possibly provide a larger mortality benefit than 
other types of PA in this relatively healthy and mostly non-Hispanic white population although 
further investigation using objective measures of running and PA is needed.

Runners. “Active” was defined as meeting the 2008 US PA Guidelines (≥500 MET-min/week) 
by participating in other aerobic PA except running (such as cycling, swimming, walking, 
basketball, racquet sports, aerobic dance, and other sports-related activities) whereas being 
labeled a “Runner” was defined as participating in any amount of running, whether above or 
below recommended PA guidelines. These results are from 55,137 men and women, aged 18-
100 years (mean age 44). 
 
However, as expected, the greatest mortality benefit, a 43% lower risk of death, was 
observed in runners who were also active in other PA (“Runners” and “Active”). Therefore, to 
get the maximal mortality benefits, participating in both running and other various PA is the 
best choice. For most inactive individuals, however, starting with light or moderate-intensity 
PA, such as brisk walking and adding vigorous-intensity PA such as running or other individually 
preferable PA later would be safe, attainable, and still beneficial for health and fitness, as 
recommended by the US and WHO PA guidelines.6,7 
Another cohort study examined different types of exercise separately while adjusting for 
all other activities and potential confounders using the data of 44,551 men aged 40-75 years at 
baseline from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study.44 Among various vigorous-intensity 
exercises and sports including running, cycling, swimming, tennis, rowing, racquetball, and 
moderate-intensity brisk walking, the authors found that only running, tennis, and brisk walking 
were inversely associated with CVD risk. In particular, men in the highest PA category (≥5 
hours/week) of each running, tennis, and brisk walking had a 46%, 28%, and 23% lower CVD 
risk, respectively, compared with men not participating in each PA, implying running’s

superiority for CVD prevention. Conversely, another study from over 80,000 British men and 
women (mean age 52 years) reported a significant risk reduction in CVD and all-cause mortality 
only for swimming, racquet sports, and aerobics, but not for running, cycling, and football.19 
One possible explanation for the non-significant results associated with running (HR=0.87, 95% 
CI=0.68-1.11 for all-cause mortality and HR=0.81, 95% CI=0.47-1.39 for CVD mortality) was the 
low statistical power from the relatively low number of mortality events (68 deaths from any 
cause and 13 deaths from CVD). These mixed results, however, make it difficult to conclude the 
relative importance between running and other PA, thus more research is required.   
Another comparison is often drawn between running versus walking on health. In a 
recent large cohort of over 400,000 Taiwanese individuals, researchers found that 5-min and 
25-min runs generated the same mortality benefits as 15-min and 105-min walks, respectively, 
with a ratio of 1:3 to 1:4.45 This notable finding confirms that running is more time efficient and 
could therefore be a better choice for busy, yet healthy individuals. However, because walking 
is usually safer and easier to start and sustain, the choice between running and walking should 
be made not only based on time efficiency, but also individual lifestyle, CRF level, health 
conditions, and personal preferences.   
 
How Much Longer Can Runners Live? 
Most cohort studies automatically adjust for age in their analyses, but data from age-group 
separated analyses indicate that morality outcomes are not only similar among young (<50 
years) and old (≥50 years) runners, but that longevity benefits are clearly the greatest among 
those who continue to run throughout their lives.17,19 Unfortunately, running participation 
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
16 
 
declines with age. Twenty to 30% of 18-29 year olds indicate that they run or jog in their free 
time. Running participation continues to decline 5-10% each decade, and less than 2% of 
people continue to run past 65 years of age.12   
Calculating life expectancy from self-reported running is complex and often follows 
various statistical approaches. Nevertheless, life expectancy is a metric that is easy to 
understand and could convey a powerful public health message. We found that runners had a 
3.2 years longer life expectancy, compared with non-runners, based on a survival analysis from 
the ACLS cohort.17 We used a conservative approach in this life expectancy estimation by 
adjusting for a comprehensive set of confounders, including baseline age, sex, examination 
year, parental history of CVD, lifestyle factors (current smoking, overweight/obesity), and 
medical conditions (abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), HTN, diabetes, and 
hypercholesterolemia). Research from the Copenhagen City Heart Study (CCHS) also found 2.6 
and 3.1 years of increased survival in male and female joggers, respectively, compared with 
non-joggers, based on a survival analysis after adjusting for a similar set of confounders and 
mediators (i.e., medical conditions).22 
The increased longevity among runners is similar to that observed in other, more 
broadly categorized types of PA. In an Asian sample of over 400,000 individuals, life expectancy 
at age 30 was 4.2 years longer for men and 3.7 years longer for women in those who performed 
≥150 min/week of moderate-intensity PA compared with inactive individuals without statistical 
adjustment for confounders.46 At age 60, the extended life expectancy among active adults was 
3.5 years in men and 3.6 years in women. Thus, the longevity benefits decreased slightly with 
age, but remained similar, possibly indicating that even fewer years of exercise, perhaps from a 
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
17 
 
late start in life, provided comparable longevity benefits. Another investigation conducted a 
pooled analysis of six cohort studies with over 650,000 participants from Western populations. 
The average gain in life expectancy after age 40 was 3.4 years among individuals who met the 
minimum recommended PA (equivalent to 150-299 min/week of brisk walking) relative to those 
with no leisure-time PA after controlling for potential confounders.47 Moreover, the gain in life 
expectancy was 4.2 years among those who performed two times the minimum recommended 
PA (equivalent to 300-449 min/week of brisk walking). The association between PA and life 
expectancy was similar between men and women and was evident at every BMI level, 
educational status, race/ethnicity, smoking status, and comorbid conditions. Performing even 
half of the PA, 75 min/week of PA, was associated with a gain of 1.8 years in life expectancy, 
compared with no activity. The statistical methods used to estimate life expectancy are 
different between studies, but the consensus is that runners have an approximately 3 years 
longer life expectancy, compared with non-runners, irrespective of sex, race/ethnicity, and 
body weight. This increase in life expectancy of 3 years is consistent with other PA studies.  
One could argue that runners, or active people in general, live longer by the same 
amount of time they have run or exercised throughout their lives, and that running and exercise 
may not actually be worthwhile because the longevity bonus is negated by the equivalent 
amount of time spent exercising. This argument collapses by simply estimating the numbers. 
Using 150 min/week (2.5 hours/week) of exercise based on the current PA guidelines, the total 
years of exercise time from the age of 30 to 80 years is only 0.74 years (2.5 hours/week X 52 
weeks X 50 years=6,500 hours, divided by 8,760 hours/year). In our running study, the average 
reported running time was approximately 120 min/week among runners, aged 44 years at

baseline. In this case, the total running time from the age of 44 to 80 years was 0.43 years, 
based on the same calculation. Running still provides 2.8 years of additional life even after 
subtracting the total running time of 0.43 years from the 3.2 years of extended life among 
runners found from the ACLS cohort. Therefore, a net “running” to “longevity benefit” ratio is 
roughly 1:7 (0.43:2.8), suggesting 1 hour of running provides an additional 7 hours of extended 
life. It is controversial whether progressively more running provides further mortality benefits, 
but running certainly provides cost-effective longevity benefits. It is also noteworthy that there 
are several other benefits of regular PA such as enhanced quality of life and improved physical 
and cognitive function in later life.31,48 
 
Is There Too Much Running for Longevity?  
Some recent studies suggest that excessive endurance exercise (EEE), such as habitual running, 
may cause adverse effects on cardiac structure and function.27,49–53 Some postulated 
mechanisms linking EEE to potential adverse cardiac effects include increased vascular oxidative 
stress and inflammation, myocardial fibrosis, and structural changes in the heart and its 
autonomic control.50,54–56 A study on 52,755 participants in the Vasaloppet 90 km cross-country 
ski marathon found that those who had completed more races than infrequent participants had 
a higher risk of developing atrial fibrillation over 10-years of follow-up although more 
dangerous arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation/cardiac arrest 
were not associated.57 Similar results on adverse cardiac effects of EEE were also reported in 
other studies.58–60 We observed a slightly higher prevalence of abnormal ECG in the highest 
running group compared with low-to-moderate running groups (Fig. 5), although not

statistically different. We also observed that runners with higher weekly running times of ≥81 
min/week had a significantly higher prevalence of parental history of CVD, compared with 
runners running 1-80 min/week (p<0.05).  
 
 
Figure 5 – Prevalence of parental history of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (A) and abnormal 
electrocardiogram (ECG) (B) by weekly running time (Adapted from Lee DC et al.17). 
 
However, these two factors, an abnormal ECG and a family history of CVD, could also 
serve as motivators for some people to engage in greater amounts of running to prevent CVD 
events. Therefore, it is difficult to determine whether strenuous running may cause abnormal 
ECG or whether strenuous runners do not get further mortality benefits because they have a 
family history of CVD from this cross-sectional observation.

We found in another examination that only coronary heart disease (CHD) deaths, unlike 
other causes of death, were relatively greater with higher doses of running (a reverse J-shaped 
association; Fig. 6). This association between running and CHD may mostly explain the reverse 
J-shaped curve between running and all-cause mortality.51,61 This finding is consistent with the 
previous suggestion of the potential adverse effect of EEE, specifically on CVD outcomes. 
However, the associations of running with other causes of death are not reverse J-shaped, but 
are more L-shaped, suggesting no increased likelihood of adverse effects, but rather consistent 
mortality benefits from increased running on various health outcomes such as cancer and 
stroke.

We compared three well-known running studies to answer the question of whether 
more running is better or worse for longevity.62 All studies indicated significant mortality 
benefits with light-to-moderate running compared with no running. These benefits were lost at 
the highest dose of running suggesting that more running may not be better for longevity and 
raises the possibility that “more could be worse” for CVD and all-cause mortality. Nevertheless, 
all three studies indicated no significantly increased risk of mortality, even at the highest dose 
of running compared with no running. Therefore, more running is not necessarily worse, 
although there may be no further mortality benefits in excessive running.  
Comparing the highest running dose to the lower running dose, two relatively small 
studies revealed that the highest running dose was associated with a significantly increased risk 
of mortality. Our study, however, with the largest sample size with over 55,000 adults 
demonstrated no increased risk of all-cause and CVD mortality even in the highest running 
group (e.g., ≥4.5 hours/week) compared with the light running group (e.g., <51 min/week). This 
was consistent in men and women, the young and old individuals, and slow and fast runners. 
There are other observational studies showing greater CVD benefits at higher doses of running 
with a linear trend in different populations.44,63 Therefore, well-controlled, intervention studies 
are certainly needed to address the controversial issue as to whether or not large doses of 
running further reduce or actually increase the risk of developing CVD, particularly CHD, risk 
factors and biomarkers.

Concern about the possibility of increased CHD events with high doses of running 
applies only to a small number of individuals and should not obviate the observation that 
running and other PA even below the current minimum PA guidelines can significantly reduce 
premature mortality.16,17,46,47,64  
 
Potential Upper Threshold for Longevity Benefits of Running   
It is too early to conclude that large amounts of running have adverse health effects. There is 
benefit in providing a cut point for an effective and safe amount of running as a guide.  We used 
the ACLS data62 to identify potential upper limits of running beyond which additional running 
provided no further mortality benefits, although there was also no excess risk of harm (Table 1).

These potential benefit thresholds are similar to findings from other large cohort studies 
on the dose-response relationships between PA and mortality. Findings from the US National 
Cancer Institute Cohort Consortium of over 660,000 men and women indicated a benefit 
threshold at approximately 40 MET-hours/week of moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic PA 
beyond which no additional mortality benefits were found.65 This study also found no

23 
 
significant harm or risk beyond this threshold compared with inactivity. Another study of 1.1 
million British women observed that those reporting strenuous PA such as running up to 6 
times/week had progressive CHD risk reduction compared with inactive women.66 There was, 
however, no further decrease in risk with daily strenuous PA beyond this level, suggesting ≤6 
times/week as the upper benefit threshold. This aligns with our upper threshold for running 
frequency. Another study also observed a reverse J-shaped association between running or 
walking and all-cause and CVD mortality in 2,377 heart attack survivors.51 Running or walking 
progressively decreased CVD mortality risk at most exercise levels, but this benefit was 
attenuated at the highest exercise levels of >50 MET-hours/week, the equivalent to running 
>30 miles/week or walking briskly >47 miles/week.  This again is similar to the upper limit of 
benefit from running found in our study. The CCHS of 5,048 relatively healthy adults observed a 
similar reverse J-shaped association between jogging and all-cause mortality, suggesting the 
loss of mortality benefits even in moderate joggers (e.g., ≥4 times/week or ≥2.5 hours/week) 
compared with sedentary non-joggers.16 The relatively lower longevity threshold in this study 
(<4 times/week or <2.5 hours/week) compared with ours (<6 times/week or <4.5 hours/week) 
is partly due to the small numbers of deaths (n=8) among moderate joggers. Another review 
study found that most studies have reported significant all-cause or CVD mortality benefits of 
vigorous-intensity exercise up to 50 MET-hours/week, although maximum benefits were 
already achieved at lower exercise doses.64 All of these data support the possible benefit 
threshold that we identified wherein further running may not provide additional longevity 
benefits, although most studies indicate no harm or excess risk of mortality even at the 
extreme amount of running or aerobic exercise. These findings, however, question the current, 
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
24 
 
overarching PA paradigm of “the more, the better” and may help shift the focus toward 
promoting the benefits of even small amounts of PA to reduce sedentary (sitting) time, which is 
an emerging health hazard in most developed countries.  
Whether or not there is an upper threshold for the benefits of running and PA will 
remain controversial, and any conclusions on a longevity benefit threshold should be 
interpreted with caution, since most results are generated from self-reported behaviors in 
largely western populations. More objective measures of running such as accelerometry will be 
helpful to determine accurately the ideal amount of running for health. The above 
recommended upper limits of running are much higher than achievable by most people. It is 
also important to mention the increased risk of musculoskeletal injury with increasing weekly 
running time and distance.67,68 Nearly 70 percent of serious runners become injured during a 
one year period,69 and high rates of injury in the highest running categories could potentially 
impact mortality outcomes, although no data are currently available.  
 
Conclusion 
There is compelling evidence that running provides significant health benefits for the 
prevention of chronic diseases and premature mortality regardless of sex, age, body weight, 
and health conditions. There are strong plausible physiological mechanisms underlying how 
running can improve health and increase longevity. Running may be the most cost-effective 
lifestyle medicine from public health perspective, more important than other lifestyle and 
health risk factors such as smoking, obesity, HTN, and DM. It is not clear, however, how much 
running is safe and efficacious and whether it is possible to perform an excessive amount of

exercise.  Also, running may have the most public health benefits, but is not the best exercise 
for everyone since orthopedic or other medical conditions can restrict its use by many 
individuals.
