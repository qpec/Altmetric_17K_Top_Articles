Is statin-modified reduction in lipids the
most important preventive therapy for
cardiovascular disease? A pro/con debate
FD Richard Hobbs1*, Maciej Banach2, Dimitri P. Mikhailidis3, Aseem Malhotra4 and Simon Capewell5
Abstract
The most prescribed medications in the world are statins, lipid modifiers that have been available for over 25 years
and amongst the most investigated of all drug classes. With over a million patient years of trial data and
publications in the most prestigious medical journals, it is remarkable that quite so much debate remains as to their
place in healthcare. They have had a bittersweet passage, with vocal concerns over their possible risks, from suicide
to cancer, and allegations that they do not work in women or the elderly, to statements that the whole published
dataset, on over 200,000 patients consenting to enter trials, was fatally compromised by being industry-funded by
and large. On the other side, there have been billions of dollars spent on generating their evidence base followed
by promotion which has returned that investment many times over in profits, and a powerful scientific lobby that
argue they are wonder drugs and that continued nihilism on their value risks patient lives. So who is right?

Introduction
FD Richard Hobbs (Fig. 1)
In this Forum article, Banach and Mikhailidis argue
that statins are well tolerated and effective in primary
and secondary prevention of all the main cardiovascular
events. They quote data from many trials, especially the
Cholesterol Treatment Trialists’ (CTT) Collaboration.
They discuss the reported high rates of adverse events
associated with statins, but argue that these can be ame-
liorated by certain strategies to help patients stay on
medication. They also tackle the perceived risks of drop-
ping low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) too
low, using medication on top of statins, namely ezeti-
mibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9
(PCSK9) monoclonal antibodies; the latter showing no
difference in adverse events with patients achieving on-
treatment LDL above or below 25 mg/ml (0.65 mmol/l),
a level that would have been unachievable a few years
ago. Talking of the event and mortality benefits seen in
primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD),
they nonetheless highlight that much residual risk
remains for patients, i.e. despite their potency, about
75 % of events continue to occur. They close by citing
basic scientific evidence of the anti-inflammatory ef-
fects of statins on endothelial plaque.
For Malhotra and Capewell, these same data elicit a
very different response. Whilst acknowledging the un-
equivocal benefit of statins in secondary prevention of
CVD, they dispute the benefits in primary prevention,
stating that there is no mortality benefit and the reduc-
tions in CVD events are not accompanied by overall re-
ductions in disease. They further undermine the case for
statins by arguing that adverse events are much underre-
ported, or even designed out, in trials, including the
CTT meta-analyses. They cite data that statins increase
rates of type 2 diabetes and further quote observational
data which suggest that 60 % of the half of patients who
stop statins after a year of use do so because of adverse
effects. They go on to argue that dietary changes are
much more important for primary prevention of CVD,
with a huge evidence base.
So how does the bewildered clinician make recom-
mendations to patients when specialists disagree on the
evidence base so fundamentally? Of course evidence is
rarely complete and increasingly it is important for us to

 try and ‘triangulate’ data from trials with real-world data,
to test whether spectrum or selection bias was possibly
influential in trial populations. The limitations of trial
data (run-in phases, potentially select populations in-
cluded, primary focus on effectiveness, etc.) are similarly
a major issue for observational data (less reliable data,
can only test associations, selective populations, etc.).
Our authors agree that statins have high value in sec-
ondary prevention of CVD, but disagree on the relative
importance of side effects in patients taking them.
There is no doubt that the greatest risk with statins is
rhabdomyolysis, occurring in 1 in 10,000 patients [1],
but this is 400 times less likely to happen in patients
than a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed (and 500 times less
likely fatal) in those taking low-dose aspirin, an over-
the-counter medication. Furthermore, this important but
very rare risk is mainly confined to the sick elderly,
should be diagnosed quickly, and usually settles quickly
on statin cessation. However, this important risk prob-
ably amplifies the increased muscle symptoms seen with
statins in the general population; muscle symptoms are a
very common complaint in life and the connection with
statins is widely made in the media. Analysis of routine
patient data in case-control analyses suggests that myop-
athy rates may be doubled by statin use [2]. But such ob-
servational data are not without confounding factors.
Does this distort patient perception of statins and indeed
adherence to them? Adjusting reported adverse event
rates in trials for the rates observed in the placebo
arms of 14 primary prevention trials (46,262 partici-
pants) showed no statin-attributable symptoms, in-
cluding muscle effects, although asymptomatic liver
transaminase elevation was 0.4 % more frequent with
statins across all trials. Serious adverse events and
withdrawals were similar in both arms [3]. The regulatory
drug
package
inserts
should
present
such
placebo-
adjusted adverse event rates, in the same way that they re-
port treatment effects over and above any placebo benefits
(observed in most trials).
The other ‘big’ safety issue is the increased rate of
diabetes by an absolute risk of 0.5 % (95 % CI 0.1–1 %,
P = 0.012) [3]. However, outcomes for those who pro-
gressed from an HbA1c below to above the diagnostic
threshold to define new onset diabetes were the same as
those not developing new onset diabetes in the trials (and
we know that patients with established diabetes get even
bigger risk reductions from statins in placebo-controlled
trials). This is not a reason to be concerned over statins in
‘eligible for treatment’ populations.
We are unlikely to quantify adverse events much fur-
ther – there is inevitable subjective weighting and inter-
pretation of the data, which will always attract those that
want to argue from one or other standpoint – and there
is probably too much sediment to ever clear now.
As for benefits, this should be easier – as if! Person-
ally, I think the data strongly point to a consistent rela-
tive risk reduction of statins across all lipid levels in
contemporary populations; we have a very abnormal
lipid phenotype in adults in most countries and it is
therefore cost effectiveness (i.e. the absolute risk in
populations) or disutility/utility arguments that should
prevail. The National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence (NICE), United States and European guide-
lines believe that the low cost of statins now means that
those down to 10 %, 7.5 % or 15 % 10-year calculated
CVD risk, respectively, are eligible to be offered a statin.
Whether they take one is therefore a patient choice issue
and we should not offer or attempt to cajole patients
one way or another. For some patients, their fear of vas-
cular disease will dominate and they may want a statin
regardless of calculated risk. For others, the risk of
symptoms will negate any perceived gain. What we
should not pretend though is that personal CVD risk
can be individually determined – our tools are crude
and work at the population not personal level. Many

 people at low calculated risk will die prematurely;
indeed, what happened to our parents may be a very sig-
nificant guide and that is not incorporated into scores.
Although it may be an accurate interpretation that mor-
tality benefits were not seen for low-risk primary pre-
vention in the trials, there were mortality gains across all
primary prevention eligible patients, and the trials only
look at 5 years’ follow-up. The available evidence sug-
gests that a mortality gain would emerge for almost
everyone using a statin above a certain risk level (such
as simply over 55 years old), but our health systems
might not want to pay for that benefit or patients
might not want to comply with chronic medication
long enough to gain.
Perhaps we should listen more to what really concerns
our patients and then base treatment recommendations
on their preferences, without unduly swaying them
against or for a statin through our own perceptions of
the huge evidence base of statins. There is never likely
to be another area of healthcare with as much evidence
as relates to statins and CVD, and yet clinicians cannot
even agree here. We all have competing interests in this
debate.
Is statin-modified reduction in lipids the most
important preventive therapy for cardiovascular
disease? Yes!
Maciej Banach and Dimitri P. Mikhailidis (Figs. 2 and 3)
Statins are commonly prescribed drugs [4] that are
well tolerated and effectively prevent cardiovascular
events both in primary and secondary prevention [5, 6].
These drugs play an essential role in patients with CVD,
as they significantly reduce the risk of acute myocar-
dial infarction (AMI), cardiovascular revascularization,
stroke, cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortal-
ity [6, 7]. It has also been shown that these effects, as
well as other benefits, might be observed irrespective
of LDL-C goals achieved [6, 7]. In a study involving
1,054 patients with AMI who had baseline LDL-C
levels <70 mg/dl (1.8 mmol/l), further statin therapy
significantly reduced the risk of the composite pri-
mary endpoint (the composite of 1-year major adverse
cardiac events, including death, recurrent myocardial
infarction, target vessel revascularization and coron-
ary artery bypass grafting) by 42 % (P = 0.015) [8].
Statin therapy also reduced the risk of cardiac death
(by 53 %, P = 0.031) and coronary revascularization
(by 55 %, P = 0.013).
In
secondary
prevention,
‘the
lower
the
better’
phenomenon has been widely discussed since important
studies such as the Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evalu-
ation and Infection Therapy-Thrombolysis in Myocardial
Infarction 22 (PROVE-IT TIMI 22) [9] trial. The debate
has been associated with some doubts concerning the
additional cardiovascular efficacy as well as safety of
further lowering of LDL-C to levels even below 40
and 30 mg/dl (1.0 and 0.8 mmol/l) [10]. These doubts have
been clarified by the IMProved Reduction of Outcomes:
Vytorin Efficacy International Trial (IMPROVE-IT) [11]
and the results of studies assessing PCSK9 inhibitors [12].
The IMPROVE-IT trial included 18,144 patients who were
hospitalized for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and had
LDL-C levels of 50–100 mg/dl (1.3–2.6 mmol/l) if they
were receiving lipid-lowering therapy or 50–125 mg/dl
(1.3–3.2 mmol/l) if they were not receiving lipid-lowering
therapy. The combination of simvastatin (40 mg) and ezeti-
mibe (10 mg) was compared with simvastatin (40 mg) and
placebo. The median LDL-C level during the study
was 53.7 mg/dl (1.4 mmol/l) in the simvastatin-ezetimibe

 group compared with 69.5 mg/dl (1.8 mmol/l) in the
simvastatin monotherapy group (P <0.001) [11]. The
Kaplan–Meier event rate for the primary endpoint at
7 years was 32.7 % in the simvastatin-ezetimibe group
compared with 34.7 % in the simvastatin monother-
apy group (absolute risk difference, hazard ratio (HR)
0.936, P = 0.016; number needed to treat (NNT) 50).
Rates of therapy-related adverse effects (AEs) were
similar in the two groups [11]. The IMPROVE-IT
trial confirmed the efficacy and safety of intensive
LDL-C-lowering in patients with ACS. Safety of the
very low concentrations of LDL-C was also confirmed
in the ODYSSEY LONG TERM trial with alirocumab
added to statins, where no differences in AEs between
the group with LDL-C below and over 25 mg/dl were
noted [12, 13]. The available studies have also shown that
the
effectiveness
of
statin
therapy,
especially
high-
intensive regimens with rosuvastatin 20–40 mg and ator-
vastatin 40–80 mg, could be very high, and even in >90 %
of patients we might achieve lipid goals [14]. Additionally,
statin therapy might not only stabilize an atheroma
plaque, but also reduces its volume as well as favourably
influencing other parameters of its morphology. In the re-
cent Lipid and Blood Pressure Meta-analysis Collabor-
ation (LBPMC) Group meta-analysis [15] we showed that
statin
therapy
significantly
reduces
plaque
volume
(standard mean difference (SMD) −0.137, P = 0.023),
external elastic membrane volume (−0.097, P = 0.027),
fibrous plaque volume (−0.129, P = 0.045) and increases
dense calcium volume (0.229, P = 0.043).
However, despite this well-established role of statin
therapy in secondary prevention patients, statin use is
also associated with AEs and residual risk [16, 17].
Statin-related AEs might impair the effectiveness of sta-
tin therapy. Most of the AEs are muscle-related; how-
ever, there are also other statin-associated AEs, such as
sleep disorders, hair loss, gastroenterological disorders
or cognitive disorders, but for many of them causality
has still not been confirmed [16, 18]. It is relevant to
note that patients with statin-related side effects at base-
line were excluded from the trials and that knowledge is
mainly based on observational cohort studies, which
probably overestimate the number of patients with AEs
after statin therapy [16, 18]. Statin intolerance is a real
phenomenon, which can affect up to 15 % of patients,
and knowledge of the most common AEs associated
with statin therapy is crucial to ensure effective treatment
of lipid disorders by reducing the risk of discontinuing sta-
tin therapy and improving therapy adherence [16, 18].
However, with careful management (take your time ap-
proach) we might successfully treat over 90 % of the pa-
tients previously reporting statin intolerance [16, 18].
The issue of residual risk has been widely discussed
for many years, each time with the occasion of new drug
development for dyslipidaemic patients [19]. According
to available studies residual risk involves 50–70 % of pa-
tients treated with statins, and recent data from the
EUROASPIRE IV survey suggest that despite the fact
that the majority (87 %) of secondary prevention patients
now receive a statin, only 21 % of high-risk patients have
LDL-C levels below 70 mg/dl (1.8 mmol/l) and 58 %
below 100 mg/dl (2.5 mmol/l) [20]. Several factors can
influence residual risk; this is associated with patients at
very high risk with concomitant diseases and polyphar-
macy, and the problem of significant underuse of high
doses of statins – in many European countries as well as
in the United States atorvastatin 80 mg or rosuvastatin
40 mg is used in <5 % of dyslipidaemic patients [20–22].
Finally the question is whether we should expect that
one drug (a statin) would completely reduce the overall
risk? Probably the best answer to this question regarding
the role of statins in secondary prevention is the fact
that all available (ezetimibe, fenofibrate) and currently
investigated (e.g. PCSK9 and CETP inhibitors) drugs are
mainly considered for use ‘on top of’ statins.
The role of statins in primary prevention seems to also
be well established [23]. The CTT meta-analysis of 14
randomized
trials
(90,056
individuals)
showed
that
statins can safely reduce the 5-year incidence of major
coronary events, coronary revascularization and stroke
by about 12 % per 1 mmol/l reduction in LDL-C, irre-
spective of the initial lipid profile or other presenting
characteristics [24]. The observed reduction in all-cause
mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, P <0.0001) reflected a
19 % reduction in coronary mortality (0.81, P <0.0001),
with significant corresponding reductions in myocardial

 infarction or coronary death (0.77, P <0.0001), in the
need for coronary revascularization (0.76, P <0.0001), in
fatal or non-fatal stroke (0.83, P <0.0001), and, combin-
ing these, of 21 % in any such major vascular event
(0.79, P <0.0001) [24]. Taking all years together, the
overall reduction of about one fifth per mmol/l LDL-C
reduction translated into 48 fewer participants having
major vascular events per 1,000 among those with pre-
existing coronary heart disease (CHD) at baseline, com-
pared with 25 per 1,000 among participants with no
such history [24].
These results were confirmed in a meta-analysis that
included ten trials (70,388 participants without estab-
lished CVD), which showed that statins significantly re-
duced the risk of all-cause mortality (odds ratio (OR)
0.88), major coronary events (0.70) and major cerebro-
vascular events (0.81) [25]. In another analysis, Ray et al.
determined whether statin therapy reduces all-cause
mortality among intermediate to high-risk individuals
without a history of CVD [26]. Data from 11 studies
with 65,229 participants showed that use of statins in
the high-risk primary prevention setting was not associ-
ated with a statistically significant reduction (RR 0.91) in
the risk of all-cause mortality. These findings comple-
ment and extend the above-mentioned meta-analyses
[24] as well as the results from the Justification for the
Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: An Intervention
Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial [27], which
reported that statins reduced death from any cause by
12 %. However, these estimates were based on information
from both individuals with and without pre-existing CHD
or stroke, which may overestimate the real benefits in the
primary prevention setting. Despite the continuing discus-
sion of the effect of statins on all-cause mortality in these
groups of patients, their role in primary prevention indi-
viduals, especially in high-risk ones, is unquestionable. In
low and moderate-risk patients the decision regarding
starting statin therapy should be assessed individually tak-
ing into account the cardiovascular risk as well as the risk
of statin-related side effects (e.g. new onset diabetes, espe-
cially in patients with overweight/obesity and/or insulin
resistance) [28].
Statins have been called the drugs of 21st century [6];
this is connected both with their potent lipid-lowering
properties as well as pleiotropic actions (e.g. anti-
inflammatory, antioxidant and antithrombotic). These
off-lipid-lowering properties have been the topic of
considerable discussion; possibly these properties are
simply the result of intense LDL-C reduction and as
a consequence decrease inflammation and oxidative
stress, and stabilize atheromatous plaques [29–31].
That is why within LBPMC Group we carried out a
series of meta-analyses, which aimed to answer the
question regarding the pleiotropic effects of statins.
Endothelial dysfunction may be associated with increased
circulating asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) levels,
an L-arginine analogue, which inhibits nitric oxide (NO)
synthesis [29]. Therefore, we assessed the effect of statins
on circulating ADMA levels [29]. In the analysis of nine
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 1,134 partici-
pants we showed a significant reduction in plasma ADMA
concentrations following statin therapy compared with
placebo (−0.104 μM, P <0.0001) [29]. We also investigated
the effect of statin therapy on circulating endothelin-1
(ET-1) levels [30]. Data from 15 RCTs showed that statin
therapy significantly reduced plasma ET-1 concentrations
(−0.30 pg/ml, P <0.01), and this effect was not affected by
the duration of statin therapy (<12 weeks: −0.51 pg/ml,
P <0.01; >12 weeks: −0.19 pg/ml, P <0.05) or by dose of
statins (<40 mg/day: −0.27 pg/ml, P = 0.01; >40 mg/day:
−0.38 pg/ml, P = 0.01) [30]. We also investigated the
antithrombotic effects of statins, analysing the effect
of statin therapy on D-dimer levels [31] and von
Willebrand factor Antigen (vWF:Ag) [32]. In the first
analysis of nine RCTs with 1,165 participants we
showed a significant effect of statin therapy in redu-
cing plasma D-dimer levels (−0.988 μg/ml, P = 0.001),
with the effect significant only in the subsets of stud-
ies with treatment duration ≥12 weeks (−0.761 μg/ml,
P <0.001) and for lipophilic statins (atorvastatin and
simvastatin) (−1.364 μg/ml, P = 0.001) [31]. In the
other meta-analysis we assessed the impact of statins
on vWF:Ag levels [32]. vWF is involved in platelet
adhesion, coagulation factor VIII binding and trans-
port, and formation and deposition of thrombus, and
elevated vWF concentrations have been shown to be
associated with endothelial dysfunction and/or injury
[32]. In the meta-analysis of 21 treatment arms we
showed
a
significant
decrease
in
plasma
vWF:Ag
levels following statin therapy (SMD −0.54, P = 0.001).
In subgroup analyses, the effect size calculated for
lipophilic statins was greater (−0.56, P = 0.003) than
that of hydrophilic ones (−0.38, P = 0.046), and in the
subset of studies lasting ≥12 weeks (−0.70, P = 0.005)
compared with that of studies lasting <12 weeks
(−0.34, P = 0.052) [32].
All these meta-analyses support the pleiotropic prop-
erties of statins and confirm the multifactorial mechan-
ism of action of statins. These effects may lead to statins
becoming the most important cardiovascular drugs, both
in primary and secondary prevention settings.
Is statin-modified reduction in lipids the most
important preventive therapy for cardiovascular
disease? No!
Aseem Malhotra and Simon Capewell (Figs. 4 and 5)
The published literature states an unequivocal mortal-
ity benefit for secondary prevention – patients with
Hobbs et al. BMC Medicine  (2016) 14:4 
Page 5 of 8
 established heart disease (absolute risk reduction (ARR)
1.2 %, NNT 83) over 5 years [33]. However, the same
does not apply in primary prevention, especially in indi-
viduals at low risk. Independent analysis of the largest
and most comprehensive meta-analysis carried out by
the CTT Collaboration revealed no mortality benefit in
individuals with a <20 % risk of developing CVD in the
next 10 years [34]. With no significant mortality benefit
the question then moves to non-mortality benefits, and
potential harms. The same large analysis suggested a 1
in 140 risk reduction in non-fatal heart attack or stroke
in those with <10 % risk of CVD over 10 years but no
reduction in serious illness. For truly informed decision
making in the prescription of statins, we believe it is an
ethical imperative to estimate both the number needed
to treat (NNT) and also the number needed to harm
(NNH) [35, 36].
There are clearly understandable problems when rely-
ing on industry-sponsored trials designed primarily to
determine the benefits of statins, to ascertain the true
incidence of side effects that may interfere with the qual-
ity of life. This partly reflects the high selectivity of
participants in clinical trials. Pre-randomization run-in
periods may also be used to exclude patients who fail
to tolerate statins. For example, 36 % of screened pa-
tients were excluded from the Heart Protection Study
before the actual trial even began, which had the poten-
tial to screen out many patients who may have suffered
from adverse effects from simvastatin, including muscle
symptoms [37]. In community-based studies, over half
of statin users will cease to take the drug within a year,
with 62 % of those patients citing side effects as the
reason [38, 39]. The uncontrolled nature of these large
cohort studies is clearly not ideal. However, a recent
article suggesting that in industry-sponsored RCTs
there are no significant differences in the rates of ad-
verse effects between active statins versus placebo
groups is unhelpful [3]. This simply adds ‘false precision
to biased estimates’ [40]. These trials have not adequately
assessed the most commonly reported side effects re-
ported by patients, notably muscle pains and cogni-
tive impairment. The head of the CTT Collaboration
has recently conceded that they did not assess for all
possible side effects [41]. As every practising clinician
knows, such side effects are common when patients
are actually asked.
A publicly funded double-blinded RCT published in
the Archives of Internal Medicine involving 1,016 low-
risk patients receiving simvastatin 20 mg, pravastatin
40 mg or placebo revealed that both drugs had a signifi-
cant adverse effect on energy/fatigue exercise score, with

 up to 40 % of women reporting reduced energy or fa-
tigue with exertion [42].
Furthermore, it is instructive to note that Pfizer’s own
patient information leaflet of atorvastatin states that
‘common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 patients)’
of the drug include pain in the throat, nausea, indiges-
tion, joint and muscle pain, and increases in blood sugar
levels [43]. Fortunately the majority of these symptoms
may be reversible on cessation of the drug. However, the
small increased 0.5–1.1 % risk of type 2 diabetes now
directly attributed to statins should not be dismissed
lightly.
Over 80 % of CVD is attributable to environmental
factors, notably unhealthy diet and also smoking, alcohol
and physical inactivity. Diet has primacy, accounting for
a larger burden of CVD disease and death than tobacco,
alcohol and inactivity combined [44].
For those at low risk eating an apple a day has an
equivalent risk reduction for myocardial infarction as
taking a statin [45]. In a recent large primary prevention
RCT for those at high risk, a Mediterranean diet supple-
mented with 30 g of nuts daily or at least 4 tablespoons
of extra virgin olive oil reduced the risk of cardiovascular
events by almost a third [46]. There was an absolute risk
reduction of 1.5 % (NNT 61) for stroke in comparison
to Mediterranean diet alone and no adverse dietary
effects noted. It is likely that these benefits might have
been even larger if compared to the average Western
diet.
Crucially, these dietary benefits are independent of dif-
ferences in LDL-C. It is the abundant alpha-linoleic acid,
polyphenols and omega-3 fatty acids provided in nuts,
olive oil, oily fish, vegetables and fruit that rapidly exert
positive health effects by attenuating inflammation, ath-
erosclerosis and thrombosis [47]. Concentrating on
LDL-lowering alone as an end in itself might therefore
be counterproductive. Indeed, insulin resistance may
emerge as the single most important determinant of cor-
onary artery disease. In young adults, preventing insulin
resistance could prevent 42 % of myocardial infarctions,
a larger reduction than correcting hypertension (36 %),
low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (31 %),
body mass index (BMI) (21 %) or LDL-C (16 %) [48]. It is
plausible that the small benefits of statins in the preven-
tion of CVD come from pleiotropic effects which are
independent of LDL-lowering. The focus in primary pre-
vention should therefore be on foods and food groups that
have a proven benefit in reducing hard endpoints and
mortality.
