Background-—Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common among patients with acute ischemic stroke and transient ischemic
attack. We evaluated whether continuous positive airway pressure for OSA among patients with recent ischemic stroke or transient
ischemic attack improved clinical outcomes.
Methods and Results-—This randomized controlled trial among patients with ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack compared 2
strategies (standard or enhanced) for the diagnosis and treatment of OSA versus usual care over 1 year. Primary outcomes were National
Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and modified Rankin Scale scores. Among 252 patients (84, control; 86, standard; 82, enhanced), OSA
prevalence was as follows: control, 69%; standard, 74%; and enhanced, 80%. Continuous positive airway pressure use occurred on
average 50% of nights and was similar among standard (3.9�2.1 mean hours/nights used) and enhanced (4.3�2.4 hours/nights used;
P=0.46) patients. In intention-to-treat analyses, changes in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and modified Rankin Scale scores
were similar across groups. In as-treated analyses among patients with OSA, increasing continuous positive airway pressure use was
associated with improved National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (no/poor, �0.6�2.9; some, �0.9�1.4; good, �0.3�1.0;
P=0.0064) and improved modified Rankin Scale score (no/poor, �0.3�1.5; some, �0.4�1.0; good, �0.9�1.2; P=0.0237). In shift
analyses among patients with OSA, 59% of intervention patients had best neurological symptom severity (National Institutes of Health
Stroke Scale score, 0–1) versus 38% of controls (P=0.038); absolute risk reduction was 21% (number needed to treat, 4.8).
Conclusions-—Although changes in neurological functioning and functional status were similar across the groups in the intention-
to-treat analyses, continuous positive airway pressure use was associated with improved neurological functioning among patients
with acute ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack with OSA.

 of CPAP among patients with acute ischemic stroke or TIA,
but they have been limited by short follow-up or small sample
size.1,3–5 The largest of the randomized trials observed
(N=126) patients with acute stroke with sleep apnea over a
2-year period.6 Patients were randomly assigned to receive
either fixed-pressure CPAP or usual care. The mean time from
stroke onset to the first cardiovascular event was longer in
the CPAP group: 15 versus 8 months (P=0.044). Two ran-
domized trials evaluated the use of early CPAP therapy for the
purpose of improving stroke severity, as measured by the
National Institutes of Health (NIH) Stroke Scale (NIHSS). One
trial of (N=56) patients with acute stroke demonstrated a
greater improvement in NIHSS with early CPAP compared
with usual care (improvement of 3.0 versus 1.0 points;
P=0.03) over a 1-month period.2 Similarly, Minnerup et al
found that the NIHSS improvement was largest among
patients with the greatest CPAP use over the first 8 days
after
stroke
(improvement
of
2.3
versus
1.4
points;
P=0.022).7 The largest of the cohort studies (N=189) had a
follow-up of 7 years and found that patients with sleep
apnea who did not use CPAP had higher recurrent stroke
rates than patients who used CPAP (32% versus 14%;
P=0.021) and a higher adjusted incidence of nonfatal
vascular events (hazard ratio, 2.87; 95% confidence interval
[CI], 1.11–7.71).
The main study had 3 primary objectives: to evaluate
whether a diagnosis and treatment intervention strategy for
sleep apnea resulted in reduction in 5 domains of vascular risk
(inflammatory, autonomic activity, insulin resistance, endothe-
lial injury, and atherosclerosis); to determine the level of CPAP
use that corresponded to greatest improvements in markers of
vascular risk; and to determine whether an enhanced interven-
tion protocol resulted in improved long-term CPAP adherence
compared with a standard intervention protocol.8 This article
describes the results of the secondary objective, which was to
examine the relationship between CPAP use and clinical
outcomes, including neurological symptom severity, functional
status, and recurrent vascular events.
Methods
The methods used in the analysis and the materials used
to conduct this trial will be made available on request; the
data must remain on the current servers, but requests for
analysis of the data can be made to the corresponding
author. This randomized controlled trial among patients
with TIA and ischemic stroke compared strategies for the
diagnosis and treatment of sleep apnea with usual care.
Patients were randomized to a control group (usual care)
or to 1 of 2 intervention groups (standard or enhanced).
The study was conducted at 5 participating hospitals in 2
centers in the United States (Yale School of Medicine
[New
Haven,
CT]
and
Indiana
University
School
of
Medicine [Indianapolis, IN]). Randomization was stratified
by center and by TIA versus stroke index event. The
principal investigators (D.M.B., H.K.Y.) and one of the
study statisticians (S.O.) were blinded to patient treatment
assignment. A Data Safety Monitoring Board, assembled
by the NIH, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute,
convened every 6 months to review unblinded recruitment
and safety data. Human subjects’ approvals were obtained
from the participating sites’ Institutional Review Boards
and by the Department of Veterans Affairs Research and
Development committees.
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Patients were included if they were ≥18 years, had a TIA or
ischemic stroke, and were within 1 week of neurological
symptom onset. Eligible patients had brain imaging within
48 hours of symptom onset. Patients were excluded for the
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• This randomized controlled trial evaluated whether contin-
uous positive airway pressure for obstructive sleep apnea
among patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic
attack improved neurological symptom severity (measured
by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale) and
functional status (measured by the modified Rankin Scale).
• We examined the effect of continuous positive airway
pressure among patients with ischemic stroke or transient
ischemic attack (intention-to-treat analysis) and among
patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack who had
obstructive sleep apnea (as-treated analysis).
• In intention-to-treat analyses, changes in National Institutes
of Health Stroke Scale and modified Rankin Scale scores
were similar across groups.
• In as-treated analyses, increasing continuous positive
airway pressure use was associated with improvements in
National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and modified
Rankin Scale: 59% of intervention patients had best
neurological symptom severity (National Institutes of Health
Stroke Scale score, 0–1) versus 38% of controls (P=0.038);
absolute risk reduction was 21% (number needed to treat,
4.8).
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Patients with ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack
should receive screening for sleep apnea in the short-term
event period, and patients with obstructive sleep apnea
should receive treatment with continuous positive airway
pressure.

 following reasons: known sleep apnea; suspected sleep
disorder other than sleep apnea (eg, narcolepsy); hospice or
receiving comfort measures only; unable to use a nasal or
face mask (eg, facial trauma); mechanical ventilation; non-
English language; inability to provide informed consent; active
suicidal ideation; residence outside the recruitment area; or
the provider did not allow research staff to contact the
patient.
Unattended Polysomnography
The
unattended
type-2
polysomnography
(Safiro;
Com-
pumedics) included the following: electroencephalography,
electrooculography, electromyography, snore channel, oral
thermistor, nasal pressure, chest and abdominal effort, leg
movements, position, electrocardiography, and oxygen satu-
ration. Polysomnographic data were scored by a single sleep
laboratory (Harvard School of Medicine). Apnea was defined
as complete cessation of airflow for ≥10 seconds and was
classified as “obstructive” if respiratory effort was present or
“central” in the absence of respiratory effort. Hypopnea was
defined as a decrease in airflow of ≥30% from baseline
associated
with
≥3%
oxygen
desaturation
or
arousal.9
Patients with an apnea-hypopnea index of ≥5 events/h were
classified as having sleep apnea.9 Central sleep apnea was
defined as present when >50% of the events were classified
as central.
Auto-Titrating CPAP
The Respironics M-series (System One; Phillips Respironics,
North Ryde, Australia) CPAP machine produced a recording of
the pressure that was delivered throughout the night,
respiratory events (apneas and hypopneas), adherence (hours
of use per night), and air leak. It used an algorithm to detect
and
distinguish
obstructive
from
central
events
and
responded accordingly. Phillips Respironics provided the
CPAP machines but had no role in the design of the study,
interpretation of results, or drafting of this article.
Intervention Protocols
Intervention patients received polysomnography as soon as
possible after the index stroke/TIA event. Intervention
patients with sleep apnea received auto-titrating CPAP. The
2 intervention protocols differed in both the frequency and
content of the visits: the enhanced protocol focused on
delivering the patient-tailored behavioral adherence program,
and the standard protocol focused on technical issues related
to the CPAP equipment. In both intervention groups, a final
visit took place at the conclusion of the subject’s participation
for outcome assessment.
Standard intervention
The standard intervention consisted of 5 in-person contacts
and 1 telephone contact over the up to 12-month follow-up.
Research staff provided an educational session about sleep
apnea and CPAP, the results of the polysomnography, and
instruction about CPAP equipment during the initial in-
person contact. In-person contacts at 1, 3, and 6 months
postenrollment allowed for interrogation of the CPAP unit
for adherence, discussions about symptom improvement
and adverse effects, and encouragement of continued use.
Enhanced intervention
The enhanced adherence intervention protocol was based
on the narrative model of patient decision making10 and
self-determination theory.11 At the time of unattended
polysomnography, patients received the standardized edu-
cational session (previously described). At the time of CPAP
delivery, patients completed a questionnaire about attitudes
and beliefs about sleep apnea, social supports, and individ-
ual risks for consequences of sleep apnea and the Self-
Efficacy Measure in Sleep Apnea.12 The staff was trained to
identify patient-specific barriers and facilitators of CPAP
adherence.
The key component of the enhanced intervention was the
development of a Personalized Positive Pressure Plan for each
patient by the intervention team that included a sleep
medicine physician, a general internist with special experi-
ence in the care of patients with cerebrovascular disease, a
doctoral-level specialist in health communications, a doctoral-
level expert in adult learning, a respiratory technician, and
members of the research staff (who were most familiar with
the individual patient). A template that included patient-
specific information served to organize the Personalized
Positive Pressure Plan deliberations. A component of the
template was a “balance sheet” of barriers and facilitators of
CPAP adherence that team members used to brainstorm
possible approaches that could be used to augment patient
adherence. The staff implemented the suggestions and, if
needed, reviewed the status of the patient at a future
Personalized Positive Pressure Plan meeting.
During the first week after CPAP initiation, the patient had
1 in-person and 2 telephone contacts to deliver the behavioral
adherence intervention. The patient received weekly in-person
contacts during the first month to encourage CPAP adher-
ence. Telephone contacts occurred at months 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9,
10, and 11 to serve as “booster sessions” for the targeted
education and behavioral adherence intervention. In-person
visits occurred at 3 and 6 months for detailed CPAP
compliance downloads. Additional in-person and telephone
visits occurred at the request of participants for additional
support.

 Usual Care
Control patients received unattended polysomnography at
the end of the follow-up. Patients and their primary care
providers
were
informed
of
polysomnographic
results;
patients with sleep apnea were encouraged to receive
CPAP. Patients in the control group were neither dissuaded
nor encouraged to seek polysomnography as part of usual
care during the follow-up.
Safety
Safety monitoring on adverse events occurred at all scheduled
follow-up visits. All adverse events were reviewed by the
internal study safety committee. Adverse event data were
provided to a safety monitor monthly, who was independent
of the investigative team. Safety data were reviewed by the
Data Safety Monitoring Board every 6 months.
Follow-Up
The study originally planned to include a 1-year follow-up for all
participants. At an interim Data Safety Monitoring Board
meeting, the decision was made to extend recruitment to
achieve the planned sample size but to not extend the trial
duration; therefore, enrolled patients had a theoretical minimum
follow-up of 6 months and a maximum follow-up of 1 year. The
recurrent vascular events were reported both as observed rates
and per 100 person-years of follow-up; the latter was calculated
as (number of events/total person-years of follow-up)9100,
where follow-up was calculated from randomization.
Outcomes
CPAP adherence
CPAP adherence was measured in terms of number of nights
of any use and number of hours of use/night. CPAP
adherence was classified as follows: “good” if [cumulative
hours used/(total nights available90.70)] was ≥4 hours;
“some”
if
[cumulative
hours
used/(total
nights
avail-
able90.70)] was <4 hours and the number of days used
was >10% of the total nights available; and “none/poor” if the
number of days used was ≤10% of the total nights available or
if the patient did not use any CPAP.13
Neurological symptom severity
Neurological symptom severity was assessed using the
NIHSS.14 The NIHSS includes 11 domains of neurological
functioning; normal neurological functioning receives a score
of 0, and increasing scores signify greater neurological
impairment. The best neurological outcome group was
defined as an NIHSS at the time of follow-up of 0 to 1.15
Functional status
Functional status was assessed using the 7-level modified
Rankin Scale (mRS) score.16 Higher scores indicate worsening
functional status, and a single point change is considered to
be clinically important.17 An mRS score of 0 indicates no
symptoms; 1, no significant disability (able to perform usual
activities despite some symptoms); 2, slight disability (able to
look after own affairs without assistance, but unable to
perform all previous activities); 3, moderate disability (re-
quires some help, but able to walk unassisted); 4, moderately
severe disability (unable to attend to own bodily needs
without assistance and unable to walk unassisted); 5, severe
disability (requires constant nursing care and attention,
bedridden, and incontinent); and 6, patients who have died.
Recurrent vascular events
The combined recurrent vascular event end point included the
following: stroke, acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina
hospitalization, urgent coronary revascularization, and all-
cause mortality. Potential vascular events were adjudicated by
independent
(blinded
to
treatment
group)
adjudicators
(a
vascular
neurologist
or
cardiologist)
using
standard
definitions.
Analysis Plan
The analysis plan included both an intention-to-treat analysis
(which included all patients) and a prespecified as-treated
analysisamongpatientswithsleepapnea,withgroupsdefinedby
CPAP use: intervention and control patients who did not use
CPAP; intervention patients with some CPAP use; and interven-
tion patients with good CPAP use. The rationale for this approach
was based on the hypothesis that CPAP treatment would only be
beneficial to patients with sleep apnea. In performing the as-
treated analyses, we lost the comparability ensured by random-
ization and results are best suited for generating hypotheses for
future research. We prespecified the plan to combine the
standard and enhanced interventions groups, if we found no
differences in CPAP use across the 2 groups.
The planned sample size of 255 patients (85 patients in
each group) was designed to provide ≥80% power for the
primary aims of the overall study; this article describes the
results of the secondary aims. No testing of statistical
significance was planned for the recurrent vascular event rate
data because the study was not designed to be powered to
detect differences in the recurrent vascular event rate.
No imputations were made for missing data. For compar-
ison of demographics, v2 or Fisher’s exact tests were used for
categorical variables, and ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis tests were
used for continuous measures. Data analyses was performed
using SAS/STAT software, SAS System for Windows Version
9.3 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).

 To determine whether an enhanced intervention proto-
col resulted in improved long-term CPAP adherence rates
compared
with
a
standard
intervention
protocol,
we
restricted the analysis to intervention patients with sleep
apnea and used logistic regression to model the propor-
tion of patients with good CPAP use. We adjusted for
length of CPAP use (defined as last CPAP use date minus
CPAP delivery date), site, and stroke versus TIA index
event.
For the comparison of the change in outcomes by CPAP
adherence groups, we restricted analyses to intervention
patients (enhanced and standard) with sleep apnea. We
constructed models, as previously described. If the overall
estimate of the effect for adherence group was statistically
significant, we further assessed the differences between pairs
of groups (eg, good versus some CPAP use).
To evaluate the change in outcomes, we used an ordinal
change analysis (also known as shift analysis) (Mantel-
Haenszel
v2
test
for
ordered
responses)
to
compare
measurements obtained at the final visit by treatment
arms.18 Using categorization systems deployed in other
acute stroke trials, we examined the mRS score across 5
ordinal categories (0 through ≥4) and the NIHSS score
across 3 categories (mild, 0–1; moderate, 2–8; severe,
≥9).19 NIHSS and mRS scores were modeled using a
generalized estimating equation Poisson model with main
effects. In the generalized estimating equation, the clusters
were defined by each patient and an independent correla-
tion
structure
was
used
in
the
primary
analysis.
In
sensitivity analyses, we used alternative correlation struc-
tures and found nearly identical results (data not shown).
The independent variables included the following: site,
stroke/TIA diagnosis, treatment group, and the day of
measurement. The main effects were selected on the basis
of the design of this randomized study.
Role of Funding Source
Although the NIH/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
convened a data safety monitoring board, the funder had no
role in the study design, data collection, data analysis, data
interpretation, or writing of this article.
Results
A total of 1884 patients were screened for eligibility (2011–
2013); 919 were excluded, and 332 refused to participate. A
total of 252 patients were randomized (84, control; 86,
standard intervention; and 82, enhanced intervention; Fig-
ure 1). Two control patients were withdrawn from the study
per protocol because of suicidal ideation. Some patients
refused specific elements of the baseline or final assessments
(eg, the blood draw), but they were retained in analyses for
which they had data; 11 control patients, 9 standard patients,
and 9 enhanced patients were excluded from the analyses
because of insufficient data (Figure 1). The reasons for
withdrawal (Figure 1) included significant concurrent illness
and “patient reasons” (eg, patients stating that the study did
not relate to their health, or the patient was “too busy” to
participate).
The baseline characteristics of the study population are
provided in Table 1; overall, 41% were women, 36% were
black, and for 80% the index event was stroke. There were few
observed differences between patients with complete versus
missing data (data not shown). The median time from
symptom onset to enrollment was as follows: control,
74 hours; standard, 91 hours; and enhanced, 93 hours
(P=0.65).
The
median
time
from
symptom
onset
to
polysomnography was 31 days in the standard group and
47 days in the enhanced intervention group; CPAP delivery
took an additional month after polysomnography. The median
follow-up was as
follows:
control, 360 days; standard,
346 days; and enhanced, 324 days (P=0.49).
The obstructive sleep apnea prevalence was as follows:
standard, 39/53 (74%); enhanced, 45/56 (80%); and control,
20/29 (69%) (Table S1). All of the intervention patients who
received polysomnography did so as part of the study
protocol; 29 control patients received polysomnography at
the end of the study per protocol, and an additional 8 control
patients received polysomnography as part of routine clinical
practice (1 patient had no sleep apnea; among the 7 patients
with sleep apnea [8.3%], 5 had some CPAP use and 2 had no
CPAP use). The mean apnea-hypopnea index for patients with
sleep apnea was as follows: control, 28.5 (�SD, 21.1)
events/h; standard, 23.7�19.6 events/h; and enhanced,
21.6�17.8 events/h (P=0.30), indicating that the sleep
apnea in this population was of moderate severity.
CPAP Adherence
More than 70% of the intervention patients with sleep apnea
had some or good CPAP use (Table 2): 25 of 36 with CPAP
use data (69.4%) of standard patients and 34 of 45 with CPAP
use data (75.6%) of enhanced patients. The median CPAP use
per nights was 4.5 hours for both standard and enhanced
patients; the enhanced protocol did not improve long-term
CPAP adherence compared with the standard protocol.
Neurological Symptom Severity and Functional
Status
In the intention-to-treat analysis (Table 3), changes in NIHSS
score were modest and were similar across each of the 3
groups (mean�SD): control, �0.5�2.1; standard intervention,

 �0.8�1.9;
enhanced
intervention,
�0.7�2.1
(P=0.80)
(Table 3). Similarly, changes in the mRS score were not
statistically different across the 3 groups: control, 0.1�1.5;
standard
intervention,
�0.6�1.2;
enhanced
intervention,
�0.3�1.5 (P=0.60).
In the as-treated analysis among patients with sleep apnea
(Table 4), increasing CPAP use was associated with improve-
ments in NIHSS score: no/poor CPAP use, �0.6�2.9; some
CPAP use, �0.9�1.4; good CPAP use, �0.3�1.0 (P=0.0064).
Similarly, increasing CPAP use was associated with improve-
ments in mRS score: no/poor CPAP use, �0.3�1.5; some
CPAP use, �0.4�1.0; good CPAP use, �0.9�1.2 (P=0.0237).
Figure 2 displays the shift analyses of final visit measures
among patients with sleep apnea. More intervention patients
were observed to have the best neurological functioning (an
NIHSS score of 0–1, indicated in dark shading), 59%
compared with 38% for control patients (P=0.038 for the
shift analysis); absolute risk reduction was 21% (number
needed to treat of 4.8 [95% CI, 3.3–8.2]). Although fewer
control patients had the best functional status on the mRS
(indicated in dark shading) compared with intervention
patients,
the
results
were
not
statistically
significant
(P=0.068 for the shift analysis).
Recurrent Vascular Events
With regard to recurrent vascular events (Table S2): 13.1
events per 100 person-years of follow-up were observed in
the control group, and 11.0 events per 100 person-years of
follow-up were observed in the intervention groups. Six
patients died during the study period, 2 in the control group, 0
in the standard intervention group, and 4 in the enhanced
intervention group (Table S3).
Discussion
The
current
study
is,
to
our
knowledge,
the
largest
randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of CPAP
among patients with a recent stroke or TIA. The results
demonstrate that CPAP therapy for patients with ischemic
stroke or TIA who have sleep apnea was associated with
statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements

 in neurological symptoms and functional status. The best
neurological functioning outcome has been used in acute
stroke therapy trials, including the original studies that
demonstrated the effectiveness of thrombolytic therapy.15 In
the present study of the effect of CPAP therapy, the
absolute risk reduction for the achievement of the best
neurological functioning was 21%, indicating that the number
needed to treat was 4.8 (95% CI, 3.3–8.2). The number
needed to treat to achieve best neurological function
associated with the diagnosis and management of sleep
apnea among patients with stroke and TIA is exceptionally
low.
To
provide
context
for
this
finding,
the
original
thrombolytic therapy study demonstrated an 11% absolute
increase in the proportion of patients achieving the best
neurological functioning, indicating a number needed to treat
of 9.1 for thrombolysis. Unlike other acute stroke therapies,
CPAP has an established track record of safety and can be
applied in addition to other effective interventions. These
results
demonstrate that this diagnosis and treatment
strategy, which focuses on the timely identification and
management of obstructive sleep apnea after stroke/TIA,
can be implemented with excellent safety.
Our results add to the body of evidence that supports the
diagnosis and treatment of sleep apnea early after a stroke or
TIA event.3 In addition to the robust literature that supports
the treatment of sleep apnea in the general population,20,21
emerging data have suggested that patients with cerebrovas-
cular disease in the early poststroke period derive neurological

 benefit from the treatment of sleep apnea. Three randomized
controlled trials demonstrated improvements in the NIHSS
score among patients treated in the acute stroke period;
however, these studies were limited by small sample sizes
(ranging from 32 to 55 patients) and short follow-ups (ranging
from 8 to 90 days).2,4,7 In contrast to the favorable evidence
supporting the diagnosis and treatment of sleep apnea in the
acute stroke or TIA period, randomized controlled trials
evaluating the use of CPAP in patients with subacute and
chronic stroke have reported mixed results.3,22–24 The SAVE
(Sleep Apnea Cardiovascular Endpoints) trial, for example,
recruited patients with established cardiovascular disease or
cerebrovascular disease, including patients who were at least
3 months poststroke.25 The results of the SAVE trial were
reported for the entire population (not just the enrolled
patients with stroke or TIA). Despite demonstrating no
difference in the primary end point of cardiovascular death,
myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalization for acute
coronary syndrome, heart failure, or TIA, the propensity-
matched analysis demonstrated that CPAP use was associ-
ated with lower stroke risk than usual care (hazard ratio, 0.56;
95% CI, 0.32–1.00; P=0.05) and lower risk of cerebral events
than usual care (hazard ratio, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.30–0.90;
P=0.02).4 Taken as a whole, the literature suggests that the
sooner after a stroke or TIA that the CPAP can be initiated, the
more substantial the improvement in clinical outcomes.
The long-term CPAP adherence rates observed in this
study indicate that >70% of patients had some CPAP use over
the �1-year follow-up; this suggests that it is feasible to
provide CPAP therapy to patients with cerebrovascular
disease. These observed rates are consistent with data from
general sleep apnea populations; for example, McArdle et al
conducted a study of 1155 patients with sleep apnea, but not
with cerebrovascular disease, and found that 68% were using

*Unadjusted P values were calculated from v2 or Fisher exact tests, or t tests (log transformations were used for nonnormal data). Adjusted P values were calculated from modeling
(logistic, multinomial logistic, or linear regressions) after controlling for the covariates of time (length of CPAP use, except for the results related to the patients who had CPAP delivered
and had CPAP use data, the total cumulative hours of CPAP per days in follow-up, and the patients who had CPAP delivered but who did not have CPAP data for whom time was the length
of follow-up), site, and transient ischemic attack/stroke index event.
†CPAP adherence categories were calculated for patients with CPAP use data and classified into 3 groups: “good” if [cumulative hours used/(total nights available90.70)] was ≥4 hours;
“some” if [cumulative hours used/(total nights available90.70)] was <4 hours and the number of days used was >10% of the total nights available; and “none/poor” if the number of days
used was ≤10% of the total nights available or if the patient did not use any CPAP.

 CPAP after 5 years.26 Given that no differences in CPAP
adherence
were
observed
between
the
standard
and
enhanced protocols, future research could deploy the stan-
dard intervention approach (which may be of greater intensity
than is typical in routine clinical care).
The major limitation of this study was missing data. Given
that
the
design
involved
randomizing
patients
before
polysomnography, we augmented the planned sample size
to account for patients without sleep apnea who were unlikely
to contribute a change in outcomes. Losses to follow-up were
equally distributed across all 3 randomization groups; there-
fore, it is unlikely that missing data biased the results. The
primary methodological risk of missing data was the potential
for overlooking associations that might not achieve statistical
significance because of reduced sample size. For example,
losses to follow-up could potentially impair our ability to
detect differences in outcomes across the 3 groups. We had
final mRS data for 64% (47/73) of control group patients, 65%
(50/77) of standard intervention patients, and 71% (52/73) of
enhanced intervention patients. Similarly, we had final NIHSS
data for 60% (44/73) of control group patients, 66% (51/77)
of standard intervention patients, and 68% (52/73) of
enhanced intervention patients. Therefore, although the
losses were similar across the 3 groups, fewer control group
patients had final outcome data compared with enhanced
group data. If all of the missing patients in the control group

 had a distribution similar to the control patients for whom we
had complete data, the difference in the mRS score between
the control and intervention groups would have been statis-
tically significant (data not shown). Another limitation of the
study was that it took �1 month to achieve CPAP delivery
after polysomnography in the intervention groups. Although
this is within the typical time it takes for CPAP delivery in
routine clinical settings, earlier initiation of CPAP therapy
might have produced greater changes in the vascular risk
domains.
Sleep apnea was present in most of this population with
stroke or TIA, with an overall prevalence rate of 76%; as
expected, central sleep apnea was rare (present in 1 patient).
However, only 8.3% of patients had sleep apnea as part of
usual care, indicating that the guideline recommendations to
screen and treat for sleep apnea are not being widely
implemented.3 Given the observed improvements in neuro-
logical symptoms and functional status, these data support
the routine use of polysomnography for all patients with an
ischemic stroke or TIA.3
