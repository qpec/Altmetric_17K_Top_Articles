Abstract
Background: Gut microbes influence their hosts in many ways, in particular by modulating the impact of diet.
These effects have been studied most extensively in humans and mice. In this work, we used whole genome
metagenomics to investigate the relationship between the gut metagenomes of dogs, humans, mice, and pigs.
Results: We present a dog gut microbiome gene catalog containing 1,247,405 genes (based on 129 metagenomes
and a total of 1.9 terabasepairs of sequencing data). Based on this catalog and taxonomic abundance profiling, we
show that the dog microbiome is closer to the human microbiome than the microbiome of either pigs or mice. To
investigate this similarity in terms of response to dietary changes, we report on a randomized intervention with two
diets (high-protein/low-carbohydrate vs. lower protein/higher carbohydrate). We show that diet has a large and
reproducible effect on the dog microbiome, independent of breed or sex. Moreover, the responses were in
agreement with those observed in previous human studies.
Conclusions: We conclude that findings in dogs may be predictive of human microbiome results. In particular, a
novel finding is that overweight or obese dogs experience larger compositional shifts than lean dogs in response
to a high-protein diet.

Background
The gut microbiome has been shown to impact the
health of its host, in particular by mediating the impact
of diet on host body weight [1–3]. Specific interactions
between dietary components, the microbiome, and the
host are however still cumbersome to determine and
confirm. While it is possible to perform such studies in
humans, the costs involved, time constraints, and the
need to control many confounders make it desirable to
conduct such research in other species, where the findings
might be predictive of human results. The traditional lab
mouse has been widely used for this purpose, but its value
has been questioned [4, 5]. Recently, pigs, although much
more expensive, have been proposed as an alternative
model as they may be closer to humans in phenotype and
diet [6, 7]. Pigs have long been known to possess a gastro-
intestinal tract similar to that of humans and have been
used as model animals in nutrition studies [8].
Here, we leverage a nutritional study on dogs (Canis lupus
familiaris) to study the relationship between its microbiome
and those of humans, pigs, and mice. The similarity of the
dog microbiome to that of humans has also been explored
using taxonomic profiling (16S-amplicon-based), focusing
on the effects of IBD (inflammatory bowel disease), with
both similarities and differences being reported in how IBD
affects the microbiome [9]. Phylogenetically, humans, dogs,
pigs, and mice are at a similar genetic distance from each

 other (see Fig. 1b), with the last common ancestor having
lived ca. 97 million years ago (Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4,
and 5) [10, 11]. However, it has previously been reported
that, across the mammalian kingdom, microbial compos-
ition clusters by the diet of the host [12, 13]. Dogs were
domesticated early in modern human history and fre-
quently shared food resources with humans, which has
been suggested as a selective force on the dog digestive
and metabolic system post-domestication [14].
Dogs are pets and companion animals and, as such,
their own well-being is of intrinsic concern. This implies
that extra care is necessary when studying these animals.
It also implies that it is important to unravel the rela-
tionship between the dog microbiome and the health of
its host [15]. In particular, an increasing prevalence of
obesity in companion dogs is a large problem as it has
an impact on pet health [16]. Recent estimates of over-
weight or obese dogs in the Western world imply that
more than half of all dogs are above their ideal weight
[17, 18]. As in humans, calorie restriction can be effect-
ive in reducing a dog’s weight [19, 20]. However, it often
leads to emotional stress in pet owners, which in turn leads
to low compliance, impairing its practical effectiveness [21].
In contrast, high-protein diets have been reported as effect-
ive as they lead to weight loss while minimizing muscle loss
[22] and induce satiety when combined with high fiber
[23]. In humans, low-carbohydrate diets have been similarly
effective at reducing weight, at least over the short term
[24, 25], with evidence that they increase satiety compared
to low-calorie diets [26].
In this context, we investigated the effect of dietary
intervention on the dog gut microbiome in a random-
ized control trial (RCT), containing equal numbers of
lean/normal (LN) and overweight/obese dogs (OW).
After a feed-in period with a baseline diet (Base), dogs
were randomly assigned to one of two diets: (1) a high-
protein/low-carbohydrate (HPLC) diet or a (2) lower-
protein/higher-carbohydrate (LPHC) diet (Fig. 2a and
Additional file 6: Table S6). This experimental design
allowed us to explore differential effects of diet on the
microbiome of OW dogs compared to that of LN dogs.

Results and discussion
A dog gut microbiome gene catalog
A total of 129 dog stool samples were collected from
64 dogs (32 Labrador retrievers and 32 beagles; see
Additional file 1: Table S1 for physical characteristics
of the study cohort), with two samples from each dog
(except for a single case where three samples were
collected from the same dog). DNA was extracted
and Illumina-sequenced in pair-end mode (125 bases
per read). Each metagenome contains an average of
117 million paired-end reads (s.d. 32 million), leading
to a total of 1.9 terabasepairs over all samples (Fig. 1a and
Additional file 2: Table S2). Following previously devel-
oped approaches [27], we assembled the metagenomic
reads from each sample into contigs, predicted genes on
these contigs, and, finally, clustered the predicted genes
from all samples into a non-redundant gene catalog (see
Fig. 1a; “Methods” section; [28]). This catalog contains
1,247,405 non-redundant (at 95% nucleotide sequence
identity) coding sequences, of which 630,230 (50.5%) are
complete genes with an average size of 884 base pairs,
compared to an average of 571 base pairs for incomplete
ones.
As many as 97% of the reads can be recruited back
to the catalog, indicating that the catalog already cap-
tures almost all of the genomic content in these sam-
ples (Fig. 1e). Two published dog metagenomes [29]
from pooled dog fecal samples of six hound-cross
dogs, sequenced using 454 technology with only ca.
500,000 reads each, were used to assess the generality
of this catalog beyond the study cohort. When map-
ping these against our catalog using the same identity

 cutoff as for the catalog generation (95%), we were
able to recruit 90.4 and 92.4% of reads to our catalog,
for the two metagenomes, respectively. This implies
that our catalog already contains most of the genomic
content of the gut microbiome of dogs in a Western
pet care center.
Taxonomic annotation (see the “Methods” section)
showed that the dog gut microbiome gene catalog is
predominantly composed of five phyla: Firmicutes, Bacteroi-
detes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Fusobacteria, with
the first two contributing more than half the detected genes
(Fig. 1c).
A comparison of the dog gut gene catalog with those
from other mammals
We compared our gene catalog with three previously
published gut microbial gene catalogs: from human [28],
pig [7], and mouse [30] hosts, which had been built
based on similar (Illumina sequencing) data with similar
computational
procedures.
We
applied
the
same
taxonomic annotation to all catalogs (see the “Methods”
section). The phylum-level distribution of genes in the
dog gut is most similar to that of the human gut catalog,
although we observe a higher proportion of genes from
Fusobacteria (Fig. 1c). The mouse catalog contains the
largest fraction of Firmicutes genes among the four
species
considered,
while
the
pig
catalog
has
a
higher fraction of genes which cannot be annotated
(Additional file 7).
As this analysis does not account for differences in
abundance of genes or microbes, we compared the
microbiomes
using
genus-level
relative
abundances
(using abundance-weighted Jaccard as the basis for an
ordination, Fig. 1d). The dog gut microbiome is closer to
that of humans than the other non-human micro-
biomes
(all
pairwise
comparisons
are
statistically
significant, p values below computational precision
limits, two-tailed Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test; see
Additional file 8: Figure S2).
To further quantify the overlap of the three animal
gut microbiomes with that of the human, we re-
cruited
short
sequencing
reads
from
each
host-
associated gut microbiome to the human gut gene
catalog [28], accounting for gene differential abun-
dance (Fig. 1e). As expected, human reads from the
MetaHIT [31] and the HMP projects [32] mapped at
the highest rate to the human catalog. Among the
animal microbiomes, a much larger fraction of dog
reads map to the human catalog than is the case for
pigs: 63% of dog reads could be mapped to the hu-
man catalog, compared to only 32.9% of pig and 19.
9% of mouse reads. When mapping human reads to
the animal catalogs, 28% of reads can be mapped to
the dog catalog, just slightly more than the fraction
that can be mapped to the pig catalog, 27.2%. A lower
rate, 22.5%, maps to the mouse catalog (Additional file 9:
Figure S3).
To evaluate the overlap between the gene catalogs,
we clustered all the catalogs together using the same
parameters as were used when building the catalogs
(see Fig. 1d). The dog gut gene pool overlaps most with
the human microbiome (309,232 out of 1,247,405, circa
26%) and the murine one least (122,131 out of 2,487,431;
4.9%), with the pig catalog in-between (797,746 out of
7,238,249; 11.0%), the latter very similar to a previous re-
port [7]. These conclusions are robust to removing low
abundance genes or equalizing the number of genes by
random sampling (see Additional file 10: Figure S4). Due
to its larger size (9,780,814 genes), the human catalog
overlaps with the animal microbiomes at much lower
rates, namely 3.2% for dogs, 8.2% for pigs, and only 1.2%
in the case of mouse.
The four-way intersection contains only a small num-
ber of genes (7513 out of a total of 21,385,247 genes
considered).
This
suggests
that
although
there
are
similar bacteria at the genus and even species level
(Additional file 3: Table S3), most strains harbor host-
specific genes [33]. To test this hypothesis and to ensure
that the similarity of the dog and human microbiomes
were not due to direct transmission of microbes from
human to dogs, we confirmed the host specificity of
strains by profiling single-nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) for species present in our dog samples and in
publicly available human microbiome samples. Among
the species with high enough coverage using default
metaSNV parameters [34], only for a single species,
Bacteroides sp. D20 was a minimal overlap in SNP space
observed between any human and dog strains, due to a
single dog sample (the two most abundant species shown
in Fig. 1f; for all six species that could be reliably profiled
given the depth of sequencing, see Additional file 11:
Figure S5). Thus, we conclude that persistent sharing of
microbial strains between hosts of a different species is a
rare event.
These different analyses consistently show that, of the
three animal gut microbiomes considered, the mouse
gut microbiome (the current go-to model system) is the
least similar to the human gut microbiome of the three
non-human animals studied. When comparing pig and
dog gut microbiomes to the human one, considering in
particular the analyses that are robust to the presence in
the catalog of rare and low abundance genes (by taking
the abundances into account), we conclude that, overall,
the dog gut microbiome has a higher taxonomic and
functional overlap with the human gut microbiome. As
microbial gut strains are host-specific, this similarity
cannot be explained solely by direct transmission be-
tween dogs and humans. Rather, it must be a function of

 similar physiology and lifestyle. To further explore the
behavior of the dog gut microbiome, particularly in com-
parison to that of humans, we investigated the dog
microbiome response to dietary intervention.
Effect of diet on the dog gut microbiome
Sixty-four dogs from two breeds were fed for 4 weeks on
a common baseline diet (Base, diet details see [35]),
followed by random assignment to one of two possible
diet interventions: high-protein/low-carbohydrate (HPLC)
or lower protein/higher carbohydrate (LPHC). The Base
diet was more similar to the LPHC (Fig. 2a (top);
Additional file 5: Table S5). To avoid the confounding ef-
fect of changes in the host phenotype, dogs were fed to
maintain initial body weight (minimum energy require-
ment). Stool samples were collected before and at the end
of the diet intervention (Fig. 2a). To control for possible
batch effects, the study subjects were randomly split into
two groups of 32 dogs and the procedure was repeated for
each groups, at the same pet care center, 1 month apart.
One of the dogs had to be excluded from analysis due to
an antibiotic treatment for an infection unrelated to the
study.
In response to the diets, we see a large shift in the
overall
taxonomic
composition
of
the
microbiome
(Fig. 2 b–d; p ≤ 0.0001 using PERMANOVA [36] for
diet effect; see also Additional file 12: Figure S6
which presents the distance boxplots for all samples,
and Additional file 13: Figure S7, which presents the
same results using Unifrac [37] and PINA [38] dis-
tances as an alternative). Specifically, the microbiome
of HPLC-fed dogs shows a larger shift than that of
LPHC-fed dogs, when compared to the Base diet,
which is in line with the similarity between the LPHC
and Base diets (Fig. 2a (top)). The consistency of the
community shift argues for a direct effect of the diet
as, in the absence of intervention, the dog microbiota
has been reported to be stable over time, using 16S
rRNA profiling [39].
In human studies, there have been several conflicting
reports of the relationship of the Firmicutes:Bacteroi-
detes phylum ratio with obesity, with some authors
reporting a higher ratio in obese individuals [40], no dif-
ference [41], or even a lower ratio [42]. For the dogs, we
see a non-significant difference between overweight/
obese (OW) and lean/normal (LN) dogs at the end of
the baseline period, with higher Bacteroidetes in OW
dogs (p = 0.064, two-tailed Wilcoxon test). However, we
observe a large and significant difference induced by the
diet, with the HPLC resulting in a higher Firmicutes:
Bacteroidetes ratio in both OW and LN dogs than LPHC
(Additional file 14: Figure S8).
At the genus level, the ratio of Bacteroides to Prevotella
has also been found to be important in the human gut
microbiome. It has been shown to change in response to
diet, with higher Prevotella relative abundance being ob-
served in high carbohydrate diets, while higher relative
abundance of Bacteroides has been associated with a high
protein diet [43, 44]. In our dog data, we observe that the
ratio of Prevotella to Bacteroides is higher in the baseline
and LPHC when compared to the HPLC (p = 4·10−10,
Kruskal-Wallis test over the three diets, all pairwise
comparisons are also significant, with p < 0.001; see
Additional file 15: Figure S9), reproducing the observa-
tions in human diet studies. A differential impact of two
diets differing in protein/carbohydrates on the gut micro-
biome of kittens was also previously reported [45, 46].
However, in that case, no global large shift was observed
in the overall Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio between diets,
while, at the genus level, Megasphaera represented a large
fraction of the microbiome of kittens fed an MPMC (mod-
erate-protein/moderate-carbohydrate) diet. In the dog
microbiome, this taxon represents only a small fraction of
the microbiota (average relative abundance of 1.1·10−3), as
it does in humans (average relative abundance of 2.8·104).
The highest overall shift in community composition
relative to pre-treatment baseline
was
observed in
HPLC-fed OW dogs (p = 0.00014, two-tailed Wilcoxon
test on compositional dissimilarities between baseline
and post-intervention samples, comparing HPLC/OW to
the rest of data; see also Fig. 2d). This effect cannot be
explained by any single genus, as it remains statistically
significant in every case after removing any single, pair,
or triplet of genera (all tests have p < 0.05; two-tailed
Wilcoxon test, comparing HPLC/OW to the rest of data,
as above). Rather, the shift seems to be driven by a
combination of four genera: Lactobacillus, Prevotella,
Streptococcus, and Turicibacter, all of which showed
significantly higher abundance variation in HPLC/OW
dogs than in all other subcohorts. Thus, the OW dogs’
microbiome was more sensitive to the dietary shift from
base to HPLC (which was a more drastic intervention
than the switch to LPHC). This is consistent with the view
that their microbiome resides in a less stable state com-
pared to those of the healthy LN population [47, 48].
Some taxa became detectable or undetectable in
response to diet (the detection limit is ca. 2·10−5 in relative
abundance). For example, Lactobacillus ruminis was not
detected in any of the HPLC-fed dogs, even though it was
present in 22% of the samples taken after baseline diet and
was detected in 59% of LPHC-fed dogs (p = 8·10−6, Fisher’s
exact
test
after
Bonferroni
correction;
see
Fig.
3a;
Additional file 16: Figure S10). This is consistent with
previous genome-based suggestions that this immuno-
modulatory microbe may have an advantage in utiliz-
ing complex carbohydrates as a carbon source [49].
On the other hand, both Intestinibacter bartlettii and
the entire Streptococcus genus are more frequently

which benefit indirectly from their metabolism in
turn. Future, more detailed annotation of metabolic
potential following from gut microbiome genes will
allow comprehensive testing whether this effect ex-
plains the taxonomic changes observed under HPLC.
To identify major changes in functional compos-
ition, we linked the genes in the catalog to KEGG
and CAZy enzyme classes and obtained functional
profiles of the metagenomes [27]. The strength of the
functional signals is exemplified by a penalized logis-
tic regression classifier (see the “Methods” section;
[50]) that can, based on either the functional or taxo-
nomic profile of a sample, predict the diet which the
dog was placed on (estimated by leave-one-out cross-
validation; see Fig. 3b).
Of the genes that changed abundance in response to
diet, five CAZy enzyme classes showed the strongest sig-
nal (Gehan’s test for doubly censored data [51], at a false
discovery rate of 5%; Fig. 3c). Four glycohydrolase clas-
ses (GHs) become less abundant in the HPLC-fed dogs,
which is consistent with these enzymes being involved in
the metabolism of complex carbohydrates, while glyco-
syltransferase 6 (GT6) is more abundant in the guts of
HPLC-fed dogs. Although the function of this ubiqui-
tous enzyme in bacteria is still unclear [52], glycosyl-
transferases (GTs) in general catalyze formation of many
different types of glycoproteins with important roles in
cell-to-cell communication and recognition, thus per-
haps utilizing or recycling carbohydrates.

cies by searching for co-abundant taxa across the dog
samples and found two large groups of microbial genera

 HPLC diet, consists mainly of genera in the Clostridiales
order, while the second one is enriched for Bacteroidiales.
In mice, a decrease in Clostridiales was accompanied by an
increase in Bacteroidiales in response to induced inflamma-
tion [54], while increased Clostridiales and decreased Bac-
teroidetes have been reported in response to high-fat and
high-sucrose diets [55]. As discussed above, better reso-
lution in metabolic annotation of gut microbial genomes
and metagenomes may allow testing to what extent direct
diet effects such as higher nutrient availability for different
fermenters drive these compositional changes.
Conclusions
Here, we present a dog gut microbiome gene catalog,
which provides over 1 million taxonomically and func-
tionally annotated genes and can serve as a resource for
future studies. Together with the taxonomic census, our
study of two dog breeds should provide a baseline for
expanding dog microbiome research to other breeds,
biogeography, and variation of living conditions (e.g., pets
and feral dogs), thus disentangling the respective contri-
bution of these factors to structuring the microbiome.
The structural and functional similarity of the dog
microbiome to the human one implies that, as human
studies are predictive of results in dogs, dog studies may
be predictive of results in humans. Thus, dog studies
provide a double benefit: for dogs directly and for their
potential to generalize to humans. We illustrate this by a
controlled dietary intervention study, in which we were
able to reproduce high-level diet effects reported in
other mammals, while also uncovering the higher re-
sponsiveness of the microbiome of overweight/obese
dogs. This is a hypothesis to be tested in future human
diet intervention studies.
Methods
Dog rearing
Sixty four dogs (32 Labrador retrievers and 32 beagles)
were selected for an 8-week feeding study (Fig. 2a).
Physical characteristics of the dogs were described in de-
tails in Additional file 1: Table S1. Dogs in each breed
were divided according to their body fat percentages into
two body condition groups: overweight or obese (OW)
and lean or normal (LN). In the first 4 weeks, all dogs
were on the commercially available Base diet. In the sec-
ond 4 weeks, dogs in each breed and body condition
group were first randomized by age, sex, and body fat
percentage into two dietary intervention groups, HPLC
and LPHC, and were switched to their assigned diets.
Fecal samples were collected and body fat percentages
were measured using dual energy X-ray absorption
(DEXA, GE Lunar DPXα with EnCore 2011 software)
after 4 weeks on the BASE diet and 4 weeks on the
intervention diets.
A staggered start with two cohorts of dogs was imple-
mented, the second cohort beginning 1 month after the
first. Dogs in each body condition and dietary group
were randomly assigned to the two cohorts by breed,
age, and sex. Dogs were fed to maintain their body
weights and were weighed weekly. The amount of food
offered to a dog was adjusted by 5% if its body weight
changed by 5% over its initial body weight. The mainten-
ance energy requirement (MER) was estimated using the
equation: MER = 139 × BW0· [56] (kilocalories), where

 BW is body weight in kilograms. Dogs had free access to
the playgrounds and socialization activities. The OW
dogs were fed to reduce their body weight after the
study.
Diets
All diets were formulated to be nutritionally complete
and to comply with the guidelines of the Association of
American Feed Control Officials and were manufactured
by the Nestlé Purina PetCare Company. All diets con-
tained animal protein as a primary protein source. The
protein level in the HPLC diet was adjusted by replacing
grains with plant protein. The macronutrient contents
and energy densities of the three diets, BASE, HPLC,
and LPHC, are listed in Additional file 6: Table S6.
Sample collection and fecal DNA extraction
Canine fecal samples were collected within 15 min of
defecation and immediately frozen at − 80 °C. The
PowerFecal DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO Laboratories,
Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used to isolate fecal gen-
omic DNA, following manufacturer’s protocol. DNA
quantification was performed using PicoGreen® assay
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
Library preparation and Illumina sequencing
The library preparation was performed following the
recommended
Nextera XT protocol from
Illumina.
(Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Guide, Part #
15031942 Rev. E January 2015, Illumina), with modifica-
tions for normalization and pooling as described below.
The library preparation workflow starts with a tag-
mentation (tag and fragmentation) of the genomic
DNA followed by the samples barcoding in dual
index (Nextera XT Index Kit v2 from Illumina) and
an amplification (12 PCR cycles). After PCR, the li-
brary was purified using AMPure beads (Beckman
Coulter) on a Sciclone robotic platform from Perkin
Elmer. The quality and quantity of each library were
evaluated using the LabChip GX Touch (capillary
electrophoresis method from Perkin Elmer).
Libraries were pooled based on the molarity calculated
by the LabChip GX Touch. The equimolar pool was as-
sembled using the Hamilton robot and was controlled
by a MiSeq run v2 50 cycles to be sure that each library
clustered properly before sequencing on the HiSeq. The
sequencing was performed on a HiSeq 2500 using v4
chemistry. The pool was loaded onto three flow cells
with pair end reads of 125 bases and dual indexing (8
bases for each index).
Sequencing was performed on a HiSeq 2500 with the
pool loaded onto three flow cells using v4 chemistry
PE125 and dual indexing with (8 bases used for each
index).
Building a gene catalog
The gene catalog was built as previously described [27,
57]: after trimming and filtering (by removing reads
which match either the canine reference genome or the
human reference), contigs were assembled for each sam-
ple separately using SOAPDenovo2 [58]. Genes were
then predicted on these reads with MetaGeneMark [59].
These genes were then clustered at 95% identity to form
the final catalog using CD-HIT [60]. All 129 metagen-
omes were included in building the gene catalog. Pre-
and post-dietary intervention samples from the same
dog were treated as separate samples and processed
independently.
Taxonomic and functional annotation of genes and
abundance estimations
For taxonomic annotation, we used the dual-BLAST
least common ancestor approach [61] using Diamond
as an alternative to BLAST [62]. Briefly, using Dia-
mond, for each gene, we searched for homologs in
the Uniprot database (version 2016_07). If no hits
with e-value 10−5 or less were found, the result was
“no hit.” Otherwise, the matched Uniprot region was
used as input to a second homolog search against
Uniprot and all hits whose e-value is equal or less
than the original e-value were recorded. This consti-
tutes the homolog neighborhood of the initial query
gene. We assign to the query gene the least common
ancestor of this neighborhood. This analysis was per-
formed with the Jug scripts [63] in the taxonomic dir-
ectory of the Supplementary Source Code.
Functional annotation of genes was performed using
MOCAT2, which was also used to generate abundance
profiles [27]. KEGG orthologous (KO) groups were fil-
tered to include only KOs which were used in the anno-
tation
of
prokaryotic
species
(thus
removing
any
spurious hits to Eukaryotes). KEGG modules were simi-
larly filtered to exclude modules which refer to more
than 50% of non-prokaryotic KEGG. This filtering was
performed with the Jug scripts in the prok-kos directory
of the Supplementary Source Code.
Strain-level SNP analysis
Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation was
quantified over representative specI genomes [64],
using an approach previously described in [65] imple-
mented by metaSNV [34]. Briefly, samples that had
enough coverage over a given genome (5× vertical
and 80% horizontal) were compared using a manhat-
tan distance on the allele frequencies of the observed
SNPs. This distance was normalized by the number of
examined SNPs so that identical variation profiles
have a distance of 0 and the ones that are completely
distinct, a distance of 1.
Coelho et al. Microbiome  (2018) 6:72 
Page 8 of 11
 Principal coordinate analysis on the distance matrices
obtained as above was used to illustrate the variation
space of bacterial species and show that dog samples are
more closely related to other dog samples than they are
to human subjects. This analysis is implemented by the
Figure-PCoA_boxplots.py script.
mOTUs construction and annotation
To determine the total microbial species composition of
each stool sample, for both taxa previously identified
and those yet to be isolated and characterized, mOTU-
LGs were constructed as described by [66]. In brief, a
non-redundant database of single copy marker genes
(MGs), extracted from reference genomes as well as
those assembled from canine and human samples, were
clustered at gene-specific species-level identity cut-offs
[64]. mOTU linkage groups (mOTU-LGs; all MGs be-
longing to a single microbial species) were produced by
correlating MG abundances across all canine samples. In
total, 228 mOTU-LGs were formed, containing between
2 and 10 MGs with an FDR of 0.02, these on average ex-
plained over 98% of total microbial abundance in a sam-
ple. mOTUs were annotated through BLAST of the
assembled MGs against reference genome MGs using a
last common ancestor approach; the reference annota-
tion at each taxonomic level was migrated over to the
mOTU-LG only when there was 100% agreement be-
tween all MG’s best hit results. For a mOTU-LG to be
annotated to the species level, 100% agreement was re-
quired between top hits as well as an identity exceeding
the MG clustering cut-off. mOTU-LG abundances were
inferred from base-scaled read mappings standardized to
the total length of the genes making up the linkage
group. The relative abundance detection limit was esti-
mated for each sample as the relative abundance of the
least-abundant mOTU-LG. The global detection limit
was the highest value (i.e., least sensitive) of all samples.
This analysis was performed with the fetchMG tool [64]
and the scripts in the motus directory of the Supplemen-
tal Software package.
Statistical analyses of the microbiome profiles
Principal coordinate analyses were performed on log-
transformed
data
using
the
Bray-Curtis
distance.
Comparisons between compositional shifts were com-
puted based on the original distance matrix and compared
using the two-tailed Wilcoxon test.
Differences in impact between diets under consideration
were evaluated using the two-sided Gehan test [51]. Log-
ratios were computed between the post-intervention and
the baseline samples. A pseudo-count was added to each
measurement (1/10th the value of the lowest non-zero de-
tection). However, if the baseline sample was below detec-
tion limit, the ratio was considered right-censored, and if
the post-intervention sample was below detection limit,
the ratio was considered left-censored. When both pre-
and post-intervention samples were below detection limit,
the sample was not taken into consideration. Multiple hy-
pothesis
testing
was
corrected
using
the
two-stage
Benjamini-Hochberg method [67].
Co-abundance statistical abundances were performed
using sparCC to estimate empirical p values [53].
Predictions of diet based on taxonomic/functional pro-
files were performed using a penalized logistic regression
classifier, using inner cross-validation for the estimation
of the hyperparameters, as implemented by scikit-learn
[56]. Prior to model fitting, features were normalized by
ranks as done previously [68].
The analysis in this subsection was performed using
the scripts in the analyses directory.
