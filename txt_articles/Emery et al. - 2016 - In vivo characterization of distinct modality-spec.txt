Mechanistic insights into pain pathways are essential for a rational approach to treating this vast and increasing
clinical problem. Sensory neurons that respond to tissue damage (nociceptors) may evoke pain sensations and
are typically classified on the basis of action potential velocity. Electrophysiological studies have suggested that
most of the C-fiber nociceptors are polymodal, responding to a variety of insults. In contrast, gene deletion
studies in the sensory neurons of transgenic mice have frequently resulted in modality-specific deficits. We have
used an in vivo imaging approach using the genetically encoded fluorescent calcium indicator GCaMP to study
the activity of dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons in live animals challenged with painful stimuli. Using this
approach, we can visualize spatially distinct neuronal responses and find that >85% of responsive dorsal root
ganglion neurons are modality-specific, responding to either noxious mechanical, cold, or heat stimuli. These
observations are mirrored in behavioral studies of transgenic mice. For example, deleting sodium channel Nav1.8
silences mechanical- but not heat-sensing sensory neurons, consistent with behavioral deficits. In contrast,
primary cultures of axotomized sensory neurons show high levels of polymodality. After intraplantar treatment
with prostaglandin E2, neurons in vivo respond more intensely to noxious thermal and mechanical stimuli, and
additional neurons (silent nociceptors) are unmasked. Together, these studies define polymodality as an in-
frequent feature of nociceptive neurons in normal animals.
INTRODUCTION
Pain afflicts more than 1.5 billion people worldwide, with hundreds of
millions suffering from long-term poorly treated pain (1). Peripheral
drive from sensory neurons activated by tissue-damaging stimuli can
cause pain, and local nerve block is very effective in most pain syn-
dromes, focusing attention on somatosensory neurons as a good target
for therapeutic intervention (2). A variety of noxious transduction re-
ceptors and channels have been identified by molecular cloning of
sensory neuron transcripts, and attempts have been made to link sen-
sation with specific receptor activation, which are not always success-
ful (3). In 1941, Gasser (4) classified peripheral sensory neurons into
three types on the basis of action potential velocity. Although all three
types (A-b, A-d, and C-fibers) may respond to noxious stimuli (4, 5),
the focus of most groups has been the set of C-fiber–associated neu-
rons that seem to respond to multiple types of damaging stimuli, the
so-called polymodal nociceptors. As well as polymodal nociceptors,
electrophysiological recordings in human skin also report classes of
C-fiber nociceptors that only respond to mechanical or heat stimuli
(6). In 1996, Perl (7) demonstrated that injury or injection of inflam-
matory mediators can unmask a set of previously silent nociceptors.
Studies of nociceptive neurons in vivo have been largely restricted to
electrophysiological recordings from teased fibers, extracellular re-
cordings, or recordings from the somata of individual dorsal root
ganglion (DRG) neurons (8–10), whereas in vitro recordings also
demonstrated polymodality (11, 12). In contrast, numerous studies
of transgenic mice in which particular cell types or molecular mar-
kers have been deleted are consistent with the existence of modality-
specific sets of sensory neurons (13–19). How to reconcile these findings
with the hypothesis that most of the nociceptors are polymodal is a
major challenge. Here, using an in vivo GCaMP optical imaging ap-
proach to monitor neuronal responses to noxious stimuli in situ, we
show that most of the somatosensory neurons in normal animals are
modality-specific.
RESULTS
Assessment of GCaMP sensitivity in DRG neurons in vitro
and in vivo
To determine the expression and sensitivity of the GCaMP indica-
tors used, we cultured and studied DRG neurons expressing either
GCaMP3 or GCaMP6s in vitro. The application of high extracellular
KCl (70 mM) caused a detectable change in GCaMP fluorescence
in 95% (1102 of 1158) and 97% (1311 of 1352) of GCaMP3- and
GCaMP6s-expressing DRG neurons, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B).
Using electrophysiological stimulation in vitro, we found that apply-
ing a single action potential–like stimulus caused a detectable change
in GCaMP fluorescence (Fig. 1C and movie S1) and that a train of
stimuli (50 pulses) was detectable at frequencies ≥0.5 Hz (Fig. 1D
and movies S2 to S4).
Next, we wanted to investigate the sensitivity of GCaMP3 in vivo.
Anesthetized mice expressing GCaMP3 had their L4 DRG exposed
and were imaged using laser scanning confocal microscopy. Tran-
sient stimulating current pulses (5 × 20 ms at 0.5 Hz) of varying
amplitude (1, 10, and 100 mA) were applied to the plantar surface
of the ipsilateral hind paw, and the activity at the level of the DRG
was recorded using in vivo electrophysiology (Fig. 2Ai). We found
that transient current pulses of 1, 10, and 100 mA led to the gener-
ation of 1.72 (±0.28), 1.83 (±0.18), and 3.88 (±0.33) action potentials
at the level of the DRG, respectively (Fig. 2Aii). The proportions of
nonresponding DRGs to individual current pulses were 68.75% (165
of 240), 47.92% (115 of 240), and 38.33% (92 of 240) for 1, 10, and
100 mA stimuli, respectively. Because 100 mA was the most reliable

 in stimulating DRG neurons, this stimulus was used to study the
changes in GCaMP3 activity in vivo. Current stimulation caused a
detectable change in GCaMP3 fluorescence from DRG neurons (Fig.
2B, i and ii), with repetitive stimulation causing a gradual rise in
overall fluorescence, most likely reflecting the slow off-kinetics of
the GCaMP3 rather than a change in action potential frequency
(Fig. 2Biii). Next, we tested the sensitivity of GCaMP3 to a variety
of noxious and tactile stimuli applied to the plantar surface of the
ipsilateral hind paw. Stimuli, including brush, noxious mechanical,
hot (55°C), and cold (0°C) stimuli caused the discrete activation of
L4 DRG neurons and could all be readily detected (Fig. 2, C and D).
Basal sensory modality testing in mice expressing GCaMP3
and GCaMP6s
Next, we investigated the basal modality responses of L4 DRG neu-
rons from GCaMP3- and GCaMP6s-expressing mice. Both GCaMP3
and GCaMP6s indicators were capable of detecting different noxious
stimuli, including mechanical force [either applied with serrated
forceps (pinch) or 2-g von Frey filament], cold (0°C water), or heat
stimuli (55°C water) (Fig. 3A, i and ii, and movie S5). Each stimulus
was applied to the ipsilateral hind paw, as shown in Fig. 3 (Bi, Ci,
and Di). The application area for cold and heat stimuli was made
much larger than the mechanical stimulus area to ensure that all me-
chanically sensitive neurons could be investigated for their responses
to 0° and 55°C stimuli. In response to mechanical pinch stimulation,
only 6.45% (2 of 31) of GCaMP3-expressing and 6.67% (3 of 45) of
GCaMP6s-expressing DRG neurons responded to both mechanical
and heat stimulation, and only 2.22% (1 of 45) of GCaMP6s neurons
responded to mechanical, cold, and heat stimulation (Fig. 3B, iii and
iv). A similar result was observed when von Frey stimulation was
used in place of mechanical pinch, with 5.88% (1 of 17) of GCaMP3
and 11.76% (2 of 17) of GCaMP6s neurons responding to both
mechanical and heat stimulation, and only 5.88% (1 of 17) of
GCaMP6s neurons responding to mechanical, cold, and heat stimu-
lation. Of the GCaMP3 and GCaMP6s neurons that only respond to

 thermal stimuli (potentially having receptive fields outside of the
mechanical stimulation area), all were modality-specific, responding
to either cold or hot stimulation (n = 146 or 100, respectively; Fig.
3D). These observations contrast with the findings from similar
experiments conducted on cultured DRG neurons in vitro, where
19.88% (34 of 171) of neurons are cold-responsive, 26.32% (45 of
171) of neurons are heat-responsive, and 53.80% (92 of 171) are
both cold- and heat-responsive (Fig. 4, A and B).
It has been reported that b-alanine–sensitive mas-related G protein–
coupled receptor member D–positive (MrgprD+) neurons are responsive
to both noxious heat and mechanical stimuli (20); however, behav-
iorally, MrgprD+ neurons only appear to be required for noxious
mechanical sensitivity rather than thermal stimuli (19). To further con-
solidate our findings, we injected b-alanine (100 mM), a specific acti-
vator of MrgprD+ neurons, into the ipsilateral hind paw and recorded
changes in GCaMP fluorescence from DRG neurons. Of the seven me-
chanically sensitive neurons that responded to b-alanine, five of them
were unresponsive to noxious heat, and only two responded to both
mechanical and heat stimulation, consistent with the principal role of
MrgprD+ neurons in noxious mechanosensation (Fig. 5, A and B) (19).
No spontaneous activity was observed following the injection of saline
(Fig. 5C).
Effect of inflammatory agents on the sensory modalities of
DRG neurons in vivo
Next, we investigated whether the sensory modalities of DRG neurons
are altered during inflammation. To test this, we injected Freund’s
complete adjuvant (FCA) into the plantar surface of the ipsilateral
hind paw and recorded stimulus-evoked GCaMP3 activity from L4
DRG neurons in vivo after 24 hours. We observed a small but statis-
tically insignificant increase in the relative number of polymodal neu-
rons responsive to mechanical (pinch) and heat (55°C) stimuli
following FCA administration (10.23%, 9 of 88) (Fig. 6A, i and ii, and
movie S6). Neurons responding only to thermal stimuli (cold or heat)
were modality-specific (Fig. 6A). To extend this analysis so that we
could examine the responsive cells and their sensory modalities in a
single neuronal field over a shorter time course, we gave an intraplantar
injection of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and recorded from the same
neurons before and 10 min after its administration (Fig. 6B).
Following PGE2 administration, we observed a change in the modality
of numerous L4 DRG neurons (Fig. 6C), as well as augmented re-
sponses from heat- and cold-sensitive neurons (Fig. 6, D and E, and
movies S7 and S8). Furthermore, we also observed responses from
neurons that were previously unresponsive (36 of 75 neurons). Al-
though the number of cold-sensitive neurons only increased modestly
(basal, n = 9; PGE2, n = 10), we observed a much bigger increase in the
number of neurons responsive to mechanical (von Frey; basal, n = 1;

and heat stimulation (polymodal; basal, n = 0; PGE2, n = 1) (Fig. 6E).
In vivo assessment of modality responses following
NaV1.8 deletion
Finally, we compared the properties of wild-type sensory neurons with
those that no longer express the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.8
(NaV1.8−/−). In vivo GCaMP3 recordings of NaV1.8−/− DRG showed
that only 5.19% (4 of 77) of neurons that gave a response to any stim-
ulus were mechanically sensitive, in comparison to wild-type neurons,
where 32.95% (29 of 88) of neurons were mechanically sensitive (see
fig. S1). In contrast, cold, heat, and mechano-heat–sensitive neurons
were similar between wild-type and NaV1.8−/− mice (see fig. S1).
NaV1.8-null mutant mice are mechano-insensitive but have normal
heat pain thresholds (21).
DISCUSSION
Technical advances have often presaged new biological insights (22).
The development of GCaMP indicators as markers for neuronal ac-
tivity has provided the first practicable route to analyze neuronal ac-
tivity in vivo without interfering with the intracellular milieu or
without penetrating the cell with an electrode (23, 24). Here, we show
that low-frequency action potential firing can give rise to detectable
changes in GCaMP fluorescence, enabling us to measure spatially dis-
tinct response profiles of large populations of sensory neurons to dif-
ferent tactile and noxious stimuli in vivo. These data demonstrate that
neurons responsive to both mechanical and heat stimuli are restricted
to ~10% of the neurons analyzed, whereas a response to mechanical,
heat, and cold stimuli occurs only in ~5% of neurons.
Whataretheconsequencesoftheseobservations?Primarily,theysug-
gest that the basal phenotype of a sensory neuron is potentially affected
by the recording technique used. Most of the studies investigating
sensory neuron function to date have used electrophysiological ap-
proaches, either in ex vivo, in vitro, or in vivo models, at the level of
the afferent nerve or the soma. Although electrophysiological approaches
provide unrivaled sensitivity, they are not without compromise.

 Ex vivo models that rely on the transection and isolation of
primary afferent nerves will inevitably perturb the physiological in-
tegrity of the system being investigated, potentially affecting how it
responds to noxious stimuli. A similar argument can also be made
for the recordings made from sensory neurons in vitro. Cultured
sensory neurons represent a population of axotomized and dis-
sociated cells that have been maintained under quasi-physiological
conditions that typically favor the viability of small neurons through
the use of specific growth factors, such as nerve growth factor.
Furthermore, responses of neurons in vitro are likely to be a fairer
representation of soma sensitivity rather than those of afferent
terminals, which could explain why >50% of cultured neurons
showed polymodality toward both heat and cold stimuli, a pheno-
type we did not observe in vivo. It is possible that cell somata are
intrinsically polymodal, reflecting protein synthesis of transducing
receptors for noxious stimuli in the cell body, whereas peripheral
terminals in vivo are modality-specific.
Although potential artifacts caused by nerve/neuron isolation, ei-
ther in ex vivo or in vitro models, may offer an explanation for the
differing observations between optical imaging and electrophysio-
logical recording, this still does not reconcile the imaging data with
the data obtained from in vivo electrophysiological studies where the
integrity of peripheral pain pathways is not compromised (25). How-
ever, extracellular recording potentially provides data from more
than one sensory neuron, and the same problem may occur with
teased fiber recordings, so this may contribute to the higher frequen-
cy of polymodality observed with these techniques.
One intriguing observation made from the current study is that
the modality of a neuron in vivo can be altered rapidly by inflam-
matory mediators, such as PGE2. Sensory neuron subsets express dif-
ferent levels of E prostanoid (EP) receptors and protein kinase A
isoforms, which may result in different responses to PGE2 in differ-
ent sets of sensory neurons (26). In addition to an increase in the
intensity of neuronal responses following PGE2 to heat and cold
stimuli, we also observed that PGE2 administration unmasked a sig-
nificant population of previously unresponsive neurons or silent no-
ciceptors, a population that was almost equal in size to the basally
responsive population. This phenomenon occurred within minutes
of administration, supporting posttranslational regulation at the
peripheral terminals of sensory neurons. There is strong evidence
for second-messenger regulation of excitability in sensory neurons,
with effects of diacylglycerol and cyclic adenosine monophosphate
on kinases and guanosine 5′-triphosphate exchange factors leading
to biophysical changes in the properties of ion channels, such as Ih,
and enhanced trafficking of ion channels and receptors, all of which
may contribute to enhanced neuronal excitability (26, 27). This ob-
servation could reconcile any discrepancy in the number of polymodal
neurons reported. It could be argued that the more invasive an ap-
proach is, the more likely it is to cause the release of inflammatory
mediators, such as PGE2, which could act to change the basal modality
responses of sensory neurons, as we have observed in the current study.
Although the release of inflammatory mediators may offer an ex-
planation for the differences in the observed polymodality, it is
nevertheless important to consider the potential limitations associated
with GCaMP imaging. First, the temporal resolution of this approach
is much lower than that obtained using an electrophysiology-based
alternative, and although we can reliably detect low-level action
potential firing in vitro and in vivo, little information can be gained
about action potential number, frequency, or conduction velocity. Sec-
ond, the spatial resolution, although still superior to electrophysiology-
based techniques, is limited to a single plane in the current study,
potentially limiting the population size (and type) of the neurons stud-
ied. An additional point to consider is that GCaMP expression, and
therefore sensitivity, at the level of the somata may be variable between
neurons. Numerous experiments were performed to test the sensitivity
of the GCaMP probe in vitro and in vivo; however, potential variation
in GCaMP expression could affect how the activation of a neuronal af-
ferent is represented by fluorescence at the level of the DRG.
In summary, our in vivo observations of intact peripheral sensory
neuron function using noninvasive optical imaging techniques con-
trast with the data obtained by electrophysiological techniques. It
seems clear that the prevailing view of a significant role for C-fiber–
associated polymodal nociceptors in normal animals needs revision.
The exquisite sensitivity of GCaMP to detect low-level action potential
firing demonstrates the modality-specific function of most somato-
sensory neurons in uninjured animals. This finding is consistent with
the many examples of modality-specific deficits described in trans-
genic knockout mouse studies of pain behavior (28). This technology
should allow us to identify sets of sensory neurons that are activated in
different pain states and, using RNA sequencing analysis, define sub-
sets of neurons that may be associated with distinct pain conditions
(29). The ability to distinguish pain mechanisms that may provide sim-
ilar phenotypes through distinct sets of neurons is, in the long term,
an important route to rational human pain treatment when markers
for these mechanisms have been identified.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
All animal procedures were approved by local ethical review com-
mittees and conformed to U.K. Home Office regulations. These
guidelines meet international standards defined by the European
Community. Experiments were performed using heterozygous
GCaMP3- and GCaMP6s-expressing mice (8 to 10 weeks old; male
and female) on a C57BL/6 background. Pirt-GCaMP3 mice were gen-
erated by X.D. (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) (30). Rosa26-
floxed-STOP-GCaMP6s mice were crossed with Advillin-Cre mice to en-
able DRG-specific expression of GCaMP6s (The Jackson Laboratory).
Mice deficient in NaV1.8 expression were previously described (31).
Cell culture
DRG neurons were isolated from GCaMP3- and GCaMP6s-
expressing mice (see “Animals”). Briefly, the dorsal side of the spinal
column was cut away using dissecting scissors, and the spinal cord
was removed. DRGs were dissected from the entire length of the spi-
nal column and transferred into a preequilibrated solution of Hanks’
balanced salt solution containing collagenase (type XI; 5 mg/ml), dis-
pase (10 mg/ml), Hepes (5 mM), and glucose (10 mM) for 30 min
(37°C, 5% CO2). DRGs were then gently centrifuged at 100 relative
centrifugal force (rcf) for 2 min, and the supernatant was discarded
and replaced with warmed Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM), supplemented with L-glutamine (1%), glucose (4.5 g/liter),
and sodium pyruvate (110 mg/liter) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS). The DRGs were mechanically triturated using
fire-polished glass Pasteur pipettes. The dissociated cells were then
centrifuged at 100 rcf for 8 min, and the supernatant was removed
and replaced with an appropriate volume of DMEM supplemented
with FBS and nerve growth factors (50 ng/ml). Cells were plated onto

 sterilized glass coverslips (13 mm, size 0) precoated with poly-L-lysine
(1 mg/ml) and laminin (1 mg/ml). Cells were maintained at 37°C for
15 to 40 hours before use at 5% CO2.
In vitro electrophysiology
All electrophysiological experiments were performed using an AxoPatch
200B Amplifier and the DigiData 1322A Digitizer (Axon Instruments),
controlled by Clampex software (version 10, Molecular Devices). Fila-
mented borosilicate microelectrodes (GC150TF-15, Harvard Apparatus)
were fire-polished to give a final resistance of 2.5 to 4 megohms. For
voltage-clamp experiments, the following solutions were used: the
extracellular solution contained 140 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 1 mM
MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2, 10 mM Hepes, 1 mM glucose (pH 7.4) with
NaOH; the intracellular solution contained 140 mM KCl, 5 mM NaCl,
1.6 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.3) with KOH. To avoid di-
alysis of GCaMP indicators, amphotericin B (200 mg/ml) was added
to the intracellular solution on the day of experimentation to en-
able perforated patch configuration. After achieving perforated
patch configuration, a holding potential of −60 mV was applied,
and the series resistance was compensated by ≥70%.
In vivo electrophysiology
Mice were anesthetized using ketamine (120 mg/kg) (Fort Dodge
Animal Health Ltd.) and medetomidine (1.2 mg/kg) (Orion Pharma)
and secured in a stereotaxic frame. A lateral laminectomy was performed
to expose lumbar DRG, and the extracellular recordings were made for
L4 DRG neurons (14- to 53-mm depth) using a Parylene-coated tungsten
electrode (A-M Systems) in C57BL/6 mice (n = 48 neurons). Trans-
cutaneous electrical stimulation was delivered with bipolar electrodes
at 20-ms-wide pulses at increasing intensity (1, 10, and 100 mA),
and the evoked activity was visualized on an oscilloscope and discri-
minated on a spike amplitude and waveform basis using a CED 1401
interface coupled to Spike2 software (Cambridge Electronic Design).
In vitro GCaMP imaging
GCaMP3- and GCaMP6s-expressing DRG neurons were cultured as
described (see “Cell culture”), placed into a perfusion chamber
attached to an inverted microscope (Nikon TE300) for electro-
physiology experiments or an upright confocal microscope (Leica SP8)
for thermal sensitivity experiments, and imaged using an oil immersion
objective (40×) or dipping objective (25×), respectively. During each
imaging experiment, the neurons were continuously perfused with ex-
tracellular solution (see “In vitro electrophysiology”) using a gravity-
fed perfusion system. For rapid heating/cooling of the extracellular
perfusate, a Peltier-driven in-line perfusion outlet was used (Warner
Instruments). The fluorescence dynamics of GCaMP3/6s (excitation,
480 ± 10 nm) were measured within each cell using a monochromator
(Cairn Research) and an EXi AQUA digital camera (QImaging).
Images were acquired at 0.1 to 1 Hz and were analyzed, after background
subtraction, using MetaFluor software (Molecular Devices).
In vivo GCaMP imaging
Heterozygous GCaMP3- and GCaMP6s-expressing mice (8 to 10
weeks old; male and female) were anesthetized using ketamine
(120 mg/kg) (Fort Dodge Animal Health Ltd.) and medetomidine
(1.2 mg/kg) (Orion Pharma). The depth of anesthesia was assessed
by pedal reflexes, breathing rate, and whisker movement. Through-
out the experiment, the body temperature of the animal was main-
tained at 37°C using a heated mat (VetTech). A dorsal laminectomy
was performed at spinal level L3-L5. Briefly, the skin was incised lon-
gitudinally, and the paravertebral muscles were cut to expose the ver-
tebral column. Transverse and superior articular processes of the
vertebra were removed using microdissection scissors and OmniDrill
35 (WPI). To have a clean image of the sensory cell bodies neurons,
the dura mater and the arachnoid membranes were carefully opened
using microdissection forceps. The animal was mounted onto a custom-
made clamp that attached to the vertebral column (L1), rostral to
the laminectomy. The trunk of the animal was slightly elevated to
reduce interference caused by respiration. The artificial spinal fluid
[containing 120 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 1.1 mM CaCl2, 10 mM glu-
cose, 0.6 mM NaH2PO4, 0.8 mM MgSO4, 18 mM NaHCO3 (pH 7.4)
with NaOH] was constantly perfused over the exposed DRG during
the procedure to maintain tissue integrity. All in vivo imaging
experiments were performed using a Leica SP8 confocal microscope
(Leica). For GCaMP excitation, a laser wavelength at 488 nm (2%
laser power) was used, and the images were acquired at a bi-
directional scan speed of 800 Hz. Noxious and tactile stimulation
was applied to the left hind paw (ipsilateral to the exposed DRG).
Noxious mechanical stimulation was performed using either serrated
forceps (pinch) or von Frey filament (2 g) stimulation. The site of
stimulation is illustrated in Fig. 2. Tactile mechanical stimulation
was performed using a fine brush applied to the plantar surface of
the hind paw (same area as for the thermal stimuli). Thermal stim-
ulation was performed by transiently immersing the hind paw with
cooled (0°C) or heated (55°C) water. The application of 37°C water
did not evoke any change in neuronal activity.
Inflammatory models
To induce a model of long-lasting inflammation, 20 ml of FCA was
applied in the ipsilateral hind paw of the mouse. Edema was con-
firmed 24 hours later, followed by the dissection and imaging of the
animal. Acute inflammation was induced with PGE2 (10 nmol per
paw) injected into the ipsilateral hind paw of the mouse.
Image analysis
All in vivo data were analyzed using LASX analysis software (Leica).
For normalized responses, each raw trace had the minimum trace val-
ue subtracted and was then normalized to the maximum trace value
[(F − Fmin)/(Fmax − Fmin)] to get a signal range of 0 to 1. Heatmap
summaries were generated by subtracting the maximum normalized
baseline value from each trace to give a baseline value of 0. To deter-
mine whether a neuron was responsive to a given stimulus, the raw
traces were first smoothed by averaging the preceding five frames of
any test frame to reduce noise. Then the derivative of each frame was
taken as DF/Dt. The neuron was included as a responder to a given
stimulus if DFstim/Dt > [(DFbasal/Dt) + 4sbasal], where Fstim is the max-
imum derivative value within a given application window, Fbasal is the
average derivative baseline value, and sbasal is the SD of the baseline
derivative values. Where appropriate, statistical analysis was per-
formed using repeated-measures ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc
testing, unless otherwise stated. Statistical analysis was performed in
GraphPad Prism 6.0.
