IMPORTANCE Off-label antipsychotic prescribing in nursing homes (NHs) is common and is
associated with increased risk of mortality in older adults. Prior large-scale, controlled trials in
the NH setting failed to show meaningful reductions in antipsychotic use.
OBJECTIVE To quantify the influence of a large-scale communication training program on NH
antipsychotic use called OASIS.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This investigation was a quasi-experimental longitudinal
study of NHs in Massachusetts enrolled in the OASIS intervention. Participants were residents
living in NHs between March 1, 2011, and August 31, 2013. The data were analyzed from
December 2015, to March 2016, and from November through December 2016.
EXPOSURES The OASIS educational program targets all NH staff (direct care and nondirect
care) using a train-the-trainer model. The program goals were to reframe challenging
behaviors of residents with cognitive impairment as the communication of unmet needs, to
train staff to anticipate resident needs, and to integrate resident strengths into daily care
plans.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES This study used an interrupted time series model of
facility-level prevalence of antipsychotic medication use, other psychotropic medication use
(antidepressants, anxiolytics, and hypnotics), and behavioral disturbances to evaluate the
intervention’
s effectiveness in participating facilities compared with control NHs in
Massachusetts and New York. The 18-month preintervention (baseline) period was compared
with a 3-month training period, a 6-month implementation period, and a 3-month
maintenance period.
RESULTS This study included 93 NHs enrolled in the OASIS intervention (27 of which had a
high prevalence of antipsychotic use) compared with 831 nonintervention NHs. Among OASIS
facilities, prevalences of atypical antipsychotic prescribing were 34.1% at baseline and 26.5%
at the study end (absolute reduction of 7.6% and relative reduction of 22.3%) compared with
a drop of 22.7% to 18.8% in the comparison facilities (absolute reduction of 3.9% and relative
reduction of 17.2%). In the OASIS implementation phase, NHs experienced a reduction in
antipsychotic use prevalence among OASIS facilities (−1.20%; 95% CI, −1.85% to −0.09% per
quarter) greater than that among non-OASIS facilities (−0.23%; 95% CI, −0.47% to 0.01% per
quarter), resulting in a net OASIS influence of −0.97% (95% CI, −1.85% to −0.09%; P = .03).
A difference in trend was not sustained in the maintenance phase (difference of 0.93%;
95% CI, −0.66% to 2.54%; P = .48). No increases in other psychotropic medication use or
behavioral disturbances were observed.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Antipsychotic use prevalence declined during OASIS
implementation of the intervention, but the decreases did not continue in the maintenance
phase. Other psychotropic medication use and behavioral disturbances did not increase. This
study adds evidence for nonpharmacological programs to treat behavioral and psychological
symptoms of dementia.

quiring hour-long geriatric psychiatrist evaluations, evening
meetings with families, up to 6 one-hour nurse trainings, and
a 4-hour administrative consultation.15
The objective of this study was to evaluate the effective-
ness of a statewide intervention program (OASIS) imple-
mented by a state nursing facility trade organization that en-
rolled more than 100 nursing homes (NHs). OASIS uses an
innovative training curriculum built on a hierarchy of needs by
Maslow.19 Unlike most behavioral management programs that
focus on reacting to and managing behavioral and psychologi-
cal symptoms of dementia,20 OASIS reframes challenging
behavior as the communication of unmet biological and psy-
chological needs. OASIS differs from traditional behavior man-
agement programs by shifting focus away from the functional
andcognitivedisabilitiesthatNHresidentshavetowardtheper-
sonhoodofwhoresidentsare.Theprimaryhypothesiswasthat
OASISisassociatedwithgreaterreductionsinantipsychoticpre-
scribingrelativetocontrols,withoutincreasingtheuseofother

ondaryhypothesiswasthatantipsychoticreductionsaremain-
tained after OASIS implementation.

The present analysis was approved by the University of Massa-

We analyzed the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Ser-
vices (CMS) Minimum Data Set (MDS) 3.0 data (aggregated to
the facility level) merged with Nursing Home Compare data
for residents living in NHs between March 1, 2011, and August
31,2013.ThedatawereanalyzedfromDecember2015,toMarch
2016, and from November through December 2016. The MDS
is a federally required assessment for residents in Medicare or
Medicaid–approved US nursing facilities and comprises more
than 400 items related to resident health and functional sta-
tus, including medication use and behavior. To complete the
MDS assessment, a nurse interviews the resident, consults the
medical record, and talks with other caregivers to collect in-
formation on the resident’
s care, cognitive and physical func-
tioning, and behavior.
Nursing home residents were excluded if they (1) had a US
Food and Drug Administration–approved indication for anti-
psychotic use (schizophrenia, Huntington disease, or Tourette
syndrome), (2) were short-term residents (length of stay <90
days), or (3) were missing data on psychopharmacological
medicationuseorbehavior.WeexcludedNHsthat(1)hadfewer
than 30 MDS resident assessments in at least 1 quarter (n = 60),
(2) were not open for the entire intervention period (n = 54),
(3) could not be linked to Nursing Home Compare (n = 1), or
(4) dropped out of the intervention (n = 2) (eFigure in the
Supplement).
OASIS Program
OASIS is a unique curriculum designed to assist NH staff in
meeting the everyday needs and challenges of today’
s long-
term care population.22 Originally a 5-module, 10- to 12-hour
staff educational program, OASIS was developed for the nurs-
ing facility setting. The number of modules was reduced to 4
after piloting the intervention. That adaptation, led by an in-
terdisciplinary team of patient advocates, trained medical pro-
fessionals, and nursing facility trade organization leaders, was
guidedbyprinciplesfordisseminationofevidence-basedprac-
tices that include highlighting the evidence base, simplifying
recommended practices, and developing practical implemen-
tation tools and guides for key stakeholders.23 The content of
the original 5 modules (http://www.oasis.today) included
(1) Understanding Maslow’
s Hierarchy of Needs, (2) Person-
Centered Care—Making Strength-Based Care Plans, (3) Behav-
ior as Communication, (4) All About Behavior, and (5) How to
Keep Residents and Staff Safe. Modules 1 through 3 were
Key Points
Question Can nursing homes reduce antipsychotic use by training
staff that behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia are
the communication of unmet resident needs?
Findings This quasi-experimental longitudinal study of the OASIS
communication training program examined antipsychotic use
before and after intervention training in 93 nursing homes. OASIS
nursing homes had greater antipsychotic use reductions compared
with 831 nonintervention nursing homes, but this influence waned
over time.
Meaning Training nursing home staff to understand challenging
resident behavior as the communication of unmet needs can
reduce antipsychotic use, but training needs to be reinforced for
a sustained influence.

 designed to run sequentially and for rapid deployment.
Modules 4 and 5 were combined and redesigned for training,
maintenance, and training reinforcement. Each module
included a well-defined set of learning objectives, a slide
presentation, exercises, supplemental activities between
learning sessions, and a pretest and posttest.

care staff (ie, housekeeping and dietary), in a team-based care
approach. Telephone-based technical assistance and support
wereofferedtoallfacilitiesfor6months(12webinars,2regional
meetings, and 2 booster sessions). Monthly telephone support
withanexpertnursefacilitatorwasprovidedto27facilitieswith
the highest prevalence of antipsychotic use.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome variable was facility-level prevalence
of antipsychotic use in long-term NH residents. The MDS 3.0
item N0410A captures the number of days antipsychotics
were used by a resident in the 7 days preceding the MDS
assessment (or since admission or reentry if <7 days). Sec-
ondary outcome measures included facility-level quarterly
prevalence of psychopharmacological medications that may
have been substituted for antipsychotic medications (anxio-
lytics [N0410B], antidepressants [N0410C], and hypnotics
[N0410D]). The behavioral problems considered included
physically abusive behavior (E0200A), verbally abusive
behavior (E0200B), and rejecting care (E0800) in the 7 days
before the MDS assessment. All variables were dichotomized
as any in the prior 7 days or none and aggregated to the facil-
ity level for each quarter.
Evaluation of the Intervention
We applied the RE-AIM framework to evaluate the Reach, Ef-
fectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance of
the intervention.24 For reach, we measured the number of fa-
cilities invited, the number who agreed to participate and met
eligibility criteria, the number of dropouts, and the number
who completed all study components. Intervention adoption
was reflected by participation at the full-day initial training.
Implementationwasreflectedinparticipationinfollow-upses-
sions, including 12 webinars, 2 regional trainer support meet-
ings, and the reported number of OASIS training modules com-
pletedduringtheinterventionperiod.Wemeasuredattendance
at 2 booster sessions. Barriers to implementation were re-
corded at regional meetings. Because staff turnover is a bar-
rier to implementation, we documented reported leadership
and ownership turnovers. Effectiveness was considered to be
changes in facility-level antipsychotic use prevalence in the
short term (December 2012 through May 2013), and mainte-
nance was considered as the postimplementation antipsy-
chotic use change (June through August 2013). The interven-
tion influence was measured by comparing facility-level
antipsychotic use prevalence in these periods with baseline
antipsychoticuseprevalence(March2011throughAugust2012)
within OASIS facilities and non-OASIS facilities.
Facility Characterization
Profit status (for profit, government, or nonprofit) and a fa-
cility’
s overall 5-star rating (with lower star ratings indicating
lower quality) were measured using data from Nursing Home
Compare.21 We measured nurse staffing levels (including reg-
istered nurse hours, licensed practical nurse hours, and cer-
tified nursing assistant hours, each per resident day) and 1 or
more health inspection deficiencies vs no inspection defi-
ciency because these factors affect quality of care and anti-
psychotic prescribing.1,25,26
Statistical Analysis
We used descriptive statistics to characterize facilities and the
reach,adoption,andimplementationofOASIS,includingχ2test
for categorical variables and t test or Wilcoxon signed rank test
forcomparisonofnormallydistributedornonnormallydistrib-
utedcontinuousvariables.Facility-levelmonthlyprevalenceof
antipsychotic use was examined for consistency and validity.
We used an interrupted time series model with external con-
trols from Massachusetts and New York facilities to evaluate
temporal trends in facility-level antipsychotic use prevalence.
The interrupted time series estimation allowed us to test for
changes in the trend (level and slope) of antipsychotic use af-
ter the intervention, controlling for historical trends.27 We es-
timated the model using a generalized least squares approach
described by Prais and Winsten.28 We tested the first-order
autocorrelationassumptionwithtestsbyDurbinandWatson.29
Wespecifiedthebasemodeltoincludeaninterceptand3terms
to estimate (1) quarterly changes in baseline facility-level anti-
psychotic use (March 2011 through August 2012), (2) the mean
level change per facility in the quarter of the intervention train-
ing period (September through November 2012), and (3) inter-
vention trend (December 2012 through August 2013). The
final model included an overall interaction term for the OASIS-
associated differences in the level change and slopes of the in-
tervention.Theinfluencefromtheinterventionappearsasadis-
ruptioninthehistoricalpattern.Inaddition,asecondaryanalysis
based on the RE-AIM framework examined maintenance of in-
tervention trends after OASIS initiation by parsing the inter-
vention period into 3 phases (training, implementation, and
maintenance). For all analyses, we use Bonferroni corrections
to account for multiple comparisons.30
We conducted sensitivity analyses to address the possi-
bility of regression to the mean. These analyses included re-
moving the top-prescribing facilities from the OASIS group in
the base model, repeating the base model analysis with the top
prescribers in both the OASIS and comparator groups re-
moved, and repeating the base model analysis in all OASIS
facilities compared with New York facilities with the highest
tertile of antipsychotic use.

 Results
We enrolled the first 25% of Massachusetts NHs (n = 106) with
a completed application (eFigure in the Supplement). Be-
cause our recruitment strategy targeted high-prescribing NHs,
OASIS facilities had a higher prevalence of antipsychotic use
before the training was launched (ie, July to September 2012)
than the non-OASIS facilities (34.1% vs 22.7%, P < .001).
OASIS facilities (median, 122; interquartile range [IQR], 88-
152 beds) were smaller than non-OASIS facilities (median, 140;
IQR, 104-200 beds; (P < .001). OASIS facilities were more likely
tobeforprofit(77.4%vs62.0%,P = .009),havecorporateown-
ership (93.5% vs 74.6%, P < .001), and provide resident-only
councils (78.5% vs 52.9%, P < .001) than non-OASIS facilities
(Table 1). OASIS facilities had higher registered nurse staffing
hours per resident (mean, 0.8 vs 0.7; P = .01) but lower certi-
fied nursing assistant hours per resident (mean, 2.3 vs 2.4;
P = .04) than non-OASIS facilities. There was no difference in
licensedpracticalnursehoursperresident.OASISfacilitieshad
a lower health inspection rating (median, 2; IQR, 1-3 vs me-
dian,3;IQR,2-4;P = .01)andweremorelikelytohave1ormore
fines (47.3% vs 20.8%, P < .001) than non-OASIS facilities.
Ninety-three OASIS nursing facilities participated in the
8-hour, in-person, training session. The mean number of
webinars attended by facilities was 6.5 (range, 0-12). Thir-
teen facilities (14.0%) attended no regional seminars, 32
(34.4%) attended one, and 48 (51.6%) attended both. Four fa-
cilities attended one booster session, and 13 attended both.
The postintervention questionnaire response rate was
65.6% (61 of 93). Half of the facilities responding to the post-
intervention questionnaire reported that they completed all
4OASIStrainingmodulesattheirfacility.Thefacilitystaffmost
often trained were the directors of nursing, nurses, certified
nursing assistants, and activities personnel (eTable 1 in the
Supplement). Approximately half of the reporting facilities
trained support staff, such as housekeeping and dietary. Phy-
sicians and nurse practitioners participated infrequently.
Among OASIS NHs responding to the postintervention ques-
tionnaire, 18.0% (11 of 61) reported administrator turnover,
31.1% (19 of 61) experienced a director of nursing turnover,
11.4% (7 of 61) had turnover of the OASIS program coordina-
tor, and 29.5% (18 of 61) recorded turnover of the staff devel-
opment coordinator or educator. Competing dementia care
training programs were reported in 67.2% (41 of 61) of facili-
ties completing the end-of-project questionnaire, including 30
using Hand-in-Hand, 16 using Alzheimer Association train-
ing, and 11 using the MassPRO dementia care training.

els of atypical antipsychotic prescribing is shown in Figure 1,

As summarized in Table 2, a decreased trend in preva-

of −1.6% per quarter, P < .001) (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
Third, we compared all OASIS facilities with the top tertile pre-
scribers from the New York facilities. This analysis showed a
difference in trend of 0.6% per quarter that was not statisti-
cally significant (P = .17) (eTable 4 in the Supplement).
An analysis examined the secondary hypothesis that an-
tipsychotic use reductions were maintained after OASIS imple-
mentation (eTable 5 in the Supplement). The intervention
phase was parsed into 3 separate periods (training, implemen-
tation, and maintenance), and analysis showed that the great-
est difference was seen in the implementation phase (differ-
ence of −1.29%; 95% CI, −2.16% to −0.42%; P = .01), but it was
not sustained in the maintenance phase (difference of 0.93%;
95% CI, −0.66% to 2.54%; P = .48).
Figure 2 and Figure 3 show no evidence of immediate
changes in prevalence or trend changes of other psychotropic
medication use or behavioral problems during the training and
implementation phases. No statistically significant changes
were found (eTables 6-11 in the Supplement).
Discussion
This investigation is the largest study to date to demonstrate
meaningful reductions in nursing facility antipsychotic pre-
scribing. The OASIS program was associated with a reduction
in antipsychotic use prevalence during the implementation
phase of the intervention, but it was not sustained in the main-
tenance phase. No increases in other psychotropic medica-
tion use or behavioral disturbances were observed. The

 OASIS influence occurred in a setting of strong secular trends
indicating reductions in prevalence of nursing facility anti-
psychotic use. These secular trends mirror national trends.
We believe that our estimate of the OASIS influence is
conservative because our study was conducted in the con-
text of a CMS campaign targeting reductions in antipsychotic
prescribing and secular trends. Nationwide relative reduc-
tions of 9% among skilled nursing facilities nationally31 have
been reported, with a mean absolute facility-level reduction
in 2012 of 4%.32 Widespread attention to antipsychotic
reductions was reported in numerous high-profile newspa-
per articles,33 an Office of Inspector General report,2 and the
nationwide Advancing Excellence Campaign (https://www
.nhqualitycampaign.org/). Among facilities participating in
OASIS,anupwardtrendinearly2011reversedataboutthetime
of the well-publicized Senate hearings on antipsychotics34 on
November 30, 2011. Spillovers from each of these events likely
contributed to reductions in antipsychotic use and thereby
attenuated our estimate of the OASIS program influence. Our
study was also conducted when competing programs, such as
theCMSHand-in-Handprogram,andculturechangeinitiatives
were launched. Because NHs were free to participate in other
programs, we believe that the estimate herein of the OASIS
influence was muted.
There were differences in actual implementation and ad-
herence to the OASIS intervention. The investigation pre-
sented is an intent-to-treat analysis that examined the out-
comes regardless of adherence. Nevertheless, we observed an
OASISinfluence,despitethelackofparticipationinOASIStrain-
ing by the actual prescribers. Only 11.5% (7 of 61) of physi-
cians and 11.5% (7 of 61) of nurse practitioners participated in
OASIStrainings.ManyOASISNHsexperiencedturnoverintheir
leadership roles. Our findings also show that the antipsy-
chotic reduction rates were greatest during the implementa-
tion phase but waned during maintenance of the program.
These challenges should be considered for sustainability of the
program within facilities. We advocate for the use of booster
sessions and opportunities for retraining.
Strengths and Limitations
Our findings must be considered in the context of several
strengths and limitations. We used an interrupted time
series model, one of the strongest quasi-experimental
designs, to evaluate interventions because it is robust to
many of the threats to internal validity.35 The technique
adjusts for differences in time-invariant confounders and
historical changes in antipsychotic use. The analytic
approach used facility-level aggregated data. While
individual-level characteristics were not adjusted for, the
case mix of residents was not expected to have changed dur-
ing the study period. Mitigating these limitations is the large
sample size of the study, as well as the inclusion of compara-
tor facilities drawn from the same and an adjoining state
relative to where the intervention was conducted.
Conclusions
This study found that the OASIS communication training pro-
gram has its most measurable influence in the 6-month pe-
riodofimplementationaftera3-monthtrainingperiod.Thefact
thatitwanedthereafterissimilartootherinterventionsinwhich
the influence dissipates without active reinforcement.36 Dif-
ferenceswerecompellinginthecontextofstrongseculartrends,
contamination by other competing dementia care programs,
and in comparison with comparator NHs. The implications are
that a program to understand resident communication and to
treatthepersonhoodofwhoNHresidentsare,withoutanovert
focus on antipsychotic prescribing per se, can be effective at
reducing the use of these risky medications.
