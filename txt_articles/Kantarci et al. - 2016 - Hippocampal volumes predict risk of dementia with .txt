Hippocampal volumes predict risk of
dementia with Lewy bodies in mild
cognitive impairment
ABSTRACT
Objective: To predict the risk of probable dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) competing with Alz-
heimer disease (AD) dementia by hippocampal volume (HV) in patients with mild cognitive impair-
ment (MCI) with impairments in amnestic or nonamnestic cognitive domains.
Methods: Patients with MCI (n 5 160) from the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center,
who participated in an MRI study at baseline from 2005 to 2014, were followed with approxi-
mately annual clinical evaluations. HVs were analyzed from 3T MRIs using FreeSurfer (5.3).
Hippocampal atrophy was determined from the most normal 10th percentile of the measurement
distributions in a separate cohort of clinically diagnosed patients with AD dementia. The subdis-
tribution hazard ratios for progression to probable DLB and AD dementia were estimated by
taking into account the competing risks.
Results: During a median (range) follow-up of 2.0 (0.7–8.1) years, 20 (13%) patients with MCI
progressed to probable DLB, and 61 (38%) progressed to AD dementia. The estimated subdis-
tribution hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for normal HV relative to hippocampal atrophy for
progression to AD dementia was 0.56 (0.34–0.91; p 5 0.02) after taking into account the
competing risks. The estimated hazard ratio for normal HV relative to hippocampal atrophy for
progression to probable DLB was 4.22 (1.42–12.6; p 5 0.01) after adjusting for age and after
including the MCI subtype in the model.
Conclusions: Preserved hippocampal volumes are associated with increased risk of probable
DLB competing with AD dementia in patients with MCI. Preservation of HV may support
prodromal DLB over AD, particularly in patients with MCI with nonamnestic features.

Identifying patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who are at risk for dementia with
Lewy bodies (DLB) is critical for early interventions. Amnestic subtype of MCI has been estab-
lished on clinical grounds in order to identify individuals who are at risk for Alzheimer disease
(AD) dementia.1,2 Patients with MCI who have impairments in nonamnestic cognitive domains
may be at an increased risk of DLB.3,4 We have previously demonstrated that the competing risk
of progression to probable DLB vs AD is higher in patients with nonamnestic MCI compared to
amnestic MCI.5

 body disease pathology.7 Furthermore, while
hippocampal phospho-tau burden is associ-
ated with hippocampal atrophy, a-synuclein
burden does not appear to influence the global
hippocampal volume in patients with Lewy
body pathology.9 Therefore preserved hippo-
campal volumes may predict progression to
DLB vs AD in MCI.
Our objectives were two fold: (1) To deter-
mine whether the risk of probable DLB
accounting for progression to AD dementia is
associated with hippocampal volume in patients
with MCI, broadly defined with impairments
in amnestic or nonamnestic cognitive domains;
and (2) To determine whether MCI subtype
and hippocampal volume would independently
contribute to predicting the risk of probable
DLB vs AD in MCI.
METHODS Participants. Consecutive patients with MCI
(n 5 160) from the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer’s Disease Research
Center participated in an MRI study during October 2005 to January
2014 and were followed approximately annually with clinical evalua-
tions and neuropsychological testing. To be included, the patients
had to have a diagnosis of MCI with at least one clinical follow-up
evaluation by the end of January 2015. Diagnosis was determined by
a consensus committee including the neurologist, neuropsychologist,
and the nurse who evaluated each participant. Patients with known
neurologic diseases such as epilepsy, brain tumors, or substance abuse
that may impact cognitive function were excluded.
The operational definition of MCI was based on clinical judgment
through a history from the patient and for the majority of patients
from an informant. Published criteria were used for the diagnosis: cog-
nitive complaint, cognitive function not normal for age, decline in cog-
nition, essentially normal functional activities, no dementia.10 In
addition, patients with MCI were classified into 1 of 4 MCI sub-
types10: (1) amnestic MCI single-domain, if the impairment was only
in the memory domain; (2) amnestic MCI multiple-domain, if the
impairment was in the memory domain and one or more nonmemory
domains such as language, attention/executive function, and visuospa-
tial processing; (3) nonamnestic MCI single-domain, if the impair-
ment was in one nonmemory domain and memory was relatively
preserved; and (4) nonamnestic MCI multiple-domain, if the impair-
ment was in more than one nonmemory domain with relative
preservation of memory. We grouped patients with single and
multiple-domain nonamnestic MCI because of the small number of
patients with nonamnestic MCI multiple-domain (n 5 9).
Diagnosis of dementia was based on DSM-IV criteria, diagnosis of
probable AD dementia was based on National Institute on Aging
(NIA)–Reagan criteria,11 although all also fulfilled the NIA–Alzheimer’s
Association clinical criteria,12 and diagnosis of probable DLB was based
on the 3rd Consortium Criteria.13 Hippocampal preservation on MRI is
not a core or supportive feature of these criteria, and therefore does not
contribute to the diagnosis of probable DLB. The clinical characteristics
of DLB were assessed in the following manner: presence of parkinsonism
was assessed through the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale part
III; visual hallucinations were characterized by being fully formed,
not restricted to a single episode, and not related to another medical
issue, treatment, or advanced dementia; fluctuations were considered
to be present if patients scored 3 to 4 on the Mayo Fluctuations
Questionnaire14; and probable REM sleep behavior disorder
(RBD) was diagnosed through The Mayo Sleep Questionnaire
validated in a polysomnography-confirmed sample from the
community, which revealed a sensitivity of 100% and specific-
ity of 95%15 using published criteria for the diagnosis of RBD as
the gold standard.16
MRI All participants underwent MRI examinations at
3T. A 3D high-resolution magnetization-prepared
rapid gradient echo acquisition was performed for
hippocampal volume measurements. Hippocampal
volume was measured with FreeSurfer software
(version 5.3) and adjusted for the total intracranial
volume (HVa) by calculating the residual from
a linear regression of hippocampal volume vs the
total intracranial volume. Hippocampal atrophy was
determined from the upper 10th percentile of the
HVa measurement distributions in patients with
clinically diagnosed AD dementia in a previous
study from an independent cohort.17 In a secondary
analysis, we derived the HVa cutoff for hippocampal
atrophy using the upper 10th percentile of the HVa
measurement from the AD converters in our sample.
Statistical analysis. We summarized baseline characteris-
tics of the patients using median (interquartile range)
for continuous variables and count (percent) for cate-
gorical variables. Because there are 2 competing out-
comes of interest, AD dementia and probable DLB,
standard survival methods would not be appropriate
and would likely give biased results. We used a propor-
tional subdistribution hazards regression survival model
considering competing risks,18 implemented in the R
package cmprsk. We estimated the cumulative inci-
dence of either clinically probable DLB or AD demen-
tia in 2 groups: those with and without hippocampal
atrophy. Because age is a significant driver of progres-
sion to dementia, age was used as the time scale for
tighter control of age effects. We summarized the re-
sults of the competing risk models using p values and
subdistribution
hazard
ratios
from
product-limit
methods to estimate the probability of a particular
dementia outcome at a moment in time, given that
the particular dementia has not occurred thus far. We
plotted the cumulative probabilities of AD or probable
DLB in the groups with and without hippocampal
atrophy, using an age range covering the youngest
(48.8) to oldest (90.5) ages with an event. A similar
approach using a multivariate model was used to
determine the contributions of hippocampal volume

 RESULTS Characteristics of the study cohort at
baseline are listed in table 1. After a median (range)
follow-up of 2.03 (0.69–8.10) years, patients with
MCI progressed to AD dementia (n 5 61; 38%),
probable DLB (n 5 20; 13%), or other dementias
(n 5 14; 9%) such as frontotemporal dementia (n 5
4), multiple system atrophy (n 5 1), progressive
nonfluent aphasia (n 5 3), semantic dementia (n 5
2), logopenic progressive aphasia (n 5 1), posterior
cortical atrophy (n 5 1), or corticobasal syndrome
(n 5 2), or died (n 5 3; 2%). Because AD dementia
and probable DLB were the 2 competing outcomes of
interest, patients with MCI who died or progressed to
other dementia were censored at the time of progression
to dementia or death. The AD dementia progressor
group had a higher frequency of women (p 5 0.005)
and APOE e4 carriers than the probable DLB
progressor group (p 5 0.004). The AD dementia
progressor group had lower median Dementia Rating
Scale score at baseline compared to the probable DLB
progressor group (p 5 0.02), but the Mini-Mental
State Examination scores were similar (p 5 0.53).
Whereas a majority of the patients with MCI were
diagnosed with amnestic MCI single-domain (n 5
89; 56%), amnestic MCI multiple-domain (n 5
34; 21%) and nonamnestic MCI (n 5 37; 23%) were
less frequent at baseline. Half of the patients with
MCI who progressed to probable DLB were diag-
nosed with nonamnestic MCI (n 5 10; 50%); on
the contrary, a majority of patients with MCI who
progressed to AD dementia were diagnosed with am-
nestic MCI single-domain (n 5 42; 69%) at baseline.
Clinical features of DLB were present in a majority of
patients with MCI who progressed to probable DLB
(n 5 19; 95%) and some had 2 or more (n 5 16;
80%) or 3 or more (n 5 9; 45%) of these clinical
features present at baseline. On the contrary, a few of
the patients with MCI who progressed to AD demen-
tia had 1 (n 5 7; 11%) and none had 2 of the clinical
features of DLB present at baseline. HVa were smaller
in the AD dementia progressor group compared to
the DLB progressor group at baseline (p , 0.001)
(figure 1). Whereas a majority of the patients with
MCI who progressed to probable DLB had normal

 HVa (n 5 17; 85%), a majority of patients with MCI
who progressed to AD dementia had hippocampal
atrophy (n 5 37; 61%) using the previously pub-
lished cutoff.17
Proportional hazards models for the HVa predict-
ing competing risks of AD dementia vs probable DLB
showed that patients with MCI with preserved HVa
had a higher risk of progression to probable DLB
(competing with AD dementia) relative to those with
hippocampal atrophy with estimated subdistribution
hazard ratio of 5.8 (1.86–18.0; p 5 0.002). On the
contrary, patients with MCI with preserved HVa had
a lower risk of progression to AD dementia (compet-
ing with probable DLB) relative to those with
hippocampal atrophy with estimated subdistribution
hazard ratio of 0.56 (0.34–0.91; p 5 0.02). Curves
showing the probability of competing risk of progres-
sion to AD dementia and probable DLB are displayed
in figure 2. We constructed multivariate models to
determine whether hippocampal volumes provide
information on probable DLB and AD risk when
adjusting for MCI subtype. We investigated patients
with MCI who had impairments in nonamnestic cog-
nitive domains (i.e., nonamnestic MCI and amnestic
MCI multiple-domain) compared to amnestic MCI
single-domain, and normal HVa compared to atro-
phic HVa as predictors of probable DLB and AD
dementia risk. In model 1, multidomain-amnestic
MCI (p 5 0.002), and nonamnestic MCI (p 5
0.0003) compared to single-domain amnestic MCI
and normal HVa compared to atrophic HVa (p 5
0.02) increased the risk of progressing to probable
DLB, accounting for competing AD dementia. In
model 2, we combined the multidomain-amnestic
MCI and nonamnestic MCI groups into one group
of patients with MCI having impairments in nonam-
nestic cognitive domains. MCI with impairments in
nonamnestic cognitive domains (p 5 0.0003) com-
pared to single-domain amnestic MCI and normal
HVa compared to atrophic HVa (p 5 0.01) increased
the risk of progressing to probable DLB accounting
for competing AD dementia. The individual subdis-
tribution hazard ratios for the 2 models are listed in
table 2. In a secondary analysis, we used the HVa
cutoff (upper 10th percentile) for hippocampal pres-
ervation or atrophy derived from the AD progressor
MCIs in our cohort and the results did not change
(table e-1 at Neurology.org).
Presence of core and suggestive clinical features of
DLB as predictors was tested in a separate multivari-
ate model to determine whether hippocampal vol-
umes provide information on probable DLB and
AD risk when adjusting for presence of these clinical
features of DLB in patients with MCI. MCI with
a clinical feature of DLB (RBD, parkinsonism, visual
hallucinations, and fluctuations) compared to MCI
without any one of these features (p , 0.001) and
normal HVa compared to atrophic HVa (p 5 0.048)
increased the risk of progressing to probable DLB
accounting for competing AD dementia (table e-2).
DISCUSSION In patients with MCI, preservation of
hippocampal volumes was associated with a higher risk
of progression to probable DLB, competing with the
risk of progression to AD dementia. Competing risk
analysis assumes that a patient with MCI who pro-
gresses to dementia will progress to either probable
DLB or AD. Therefore the subdistribution hazard
ratios for a dementia outcome are estimated by using
the other dementia outcome as a competing risk. Pa-
tients with MCI with preserved hippocampal volumes
had a hazard risk of progression to probable DLB 5.8
times that of those with hippocampal atrophy, when
accounting for competing risk of progression to AD
dementia. Furthermore, preserved hippocampal vol-
umes predicted the hazard risk of progression to prob-
able DLB along with the diagnosis of MCI with
impairments in nonamnestic cognitive domains with
or without memory impairment.
Hippocampal atrophy is associated with a higher
risk of progression to AD dementia in patients with
MCI.19 Based on these observations, hippocampal
atrophy is included in the research criteria to support
the diagnosis of MCI due to AD.2 However, the

 underlying etiologies of MCI, broadly defined with
impairments in amnestic or nonamnestic cognitive
domains, are heterogeneous.1 Both vascular and Lewy
body disease may contribute to the cognitive difficul-
ties in patients with MCI.20,21 Furthermore, hippo-
campal volumes may be relatively preserved in
patients with MCI, particularly in those with non-
amnestic MCI.22
In the current study, preserved hippocampal vol-
umes predicted progression to DLB accounting for
the competing risk for progression to AD dementia,
even after considering nonamnestic MCI compared to
amnestic MCI single-domain diagnosis. Impairment
in nonamnestic cognitive domains, particularly in the
attention and visual-spatial processing domains, increases
the risk for probable DLB in MCI.4,5,23 While nonam-
nestic MCI is characterized by relative preservation of
hippocampal volumes, hippocampal atrophy may be
present in some patients with nonamnestic MCI.22 Fur-
thermore, hippocampal atrophy is common in patients
with multiple-domain amnestic MCI, and these patients
are at risk for both probable DLB and AD demen-
tia.3,5,20,23 Thus, the distinction of patients with MCI
who will progress to DLB vs AD dementia may not
be clear only by the MCI subtype. Data from the current
study suggest that hippocampal volumes predict progres-
sion to probable DLB along with the MCI subtype.
Relative preservation of medial temporal lobe struc-
tures is a supportive feature in the 3rd report of the
DLB Consortium Criteria, categorized as a feature that
is commonly present in DLB.13 However, as a support-
ive feature, preservation of hippocampal volume does
not contribute to the diagnosis of probable DLB,
which is made based on presence of 2 or more core
and suggestive features.24 In particular, hippocampal
atrophy suggests additional AD-related neurofibrillary
tangle pathology in probable DLB cases and may dif-
ferentiate patients with mixed AD and Lewy body
disease pathology from those with DLB.6–9 Preserva-
tion of hippocampal volumes is also observed in pa-
tients with hippocampal sparing AD,25 therefore is not
specific to DLB. We censored individuals who pro-
gressed to dementia syndromes other than AD demen-
tia or probable DLB at the time of progression to
dementia and several of these patients as well as those
who received a clinical diagnosis of probable DLB or
AD dementia may have had atypical AD pathol-
ogy.26,27 Preservation of hippocampal volume in cases
of atypical AD dementia may decrease the specificity of
preserved hippocampal volumes in predicting progres-
sion to probable DLB in MCI. Furthermore, absence
of hippocampal atrophy might have rather low positive
predictive value in cognitively normal individuals;
therefore the application would be limited to patients
with MCI.
There are limitations to our study that need to be
addressed. First, the study cohort was from an Alz-
heimer Disease Research Center–based dementia
clinic sample, which was relatively small and is prone
to ascertainment biases. Epidemiologic studies that
examine the transition from MCI to probable DLB
and the role of biomarkers in predicting this transi-
tion are needed. Furthermore, the outcomes of
interest were clinical diagnosis of probable DLB or
AD dementia. The clinical criteria for the diagnosis of
DLB are criticized for having low sensitivity.28,29
Moreover, patients who fulfill the clinical criteria for
probable DLB may have additional AD pathology
and Lewy body disease pathology may be present in

 patients with AD dementia. Thus, many of our cases
may have mixed AD and Lewy body disease patholo-
gies. Pathologic confirmation of the diagnosis of DLB
and AD is critical. Many of the patients with MCI had
one or more of the core and suggestive features of
probable DLB. We found that hippocampal volumes
may be predictive of DLB vs AD diagnosis in addition
to these clinical features. However, this finding should
be interpreted with caution, because DLB competing
with AD diagnosis was predicted based on the very
features that are used for diagnosing probable DLB,
and addition of the clinical features to the models
introduced multicollinearity due to correlations among
the predictors. An autopsy-confirmed and longitudi-
nally followed cohort of patients with MCI is needed
to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the core
and suggestive clinical features of Lewy body disease at
the stage of MCI.3,30 Finally, approximately 49% of
the patients with MCI in our cohort were stable during
follow-up. It is expected that there will be patients who
progress to probable DLB or AD dementia from the
MCI stable group in the future.
In a cohort of consecutive patients with MCI from
a referral clinic, we demonstrated that those with pre-
served hippocampal volumes are at an increased risk for
probable DLB, competing with the risk of progression
to AD dementia, even after considering the MCI sub-
type. Therefore both nonamnestic features and hippo-
campal preservation may be considered for identifying
patients with MCI at risk for probable DLB. Better
response to cholinesterase inhibitors and neuroleptic
sensitivity may need to be addressed in patients with
MCI who are likely to progress to probable DLB.
