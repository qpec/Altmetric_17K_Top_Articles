Problem solving and innovation are key components of intelligence. We compare wild-caught individuals from two
species that are close relatives of Darwin’s finches, the innovative Loxigilla barbadensis, and its most closely related
species in Barbados, the conservative Tiaris bicolor. We found an all-or-none difference in the problem-solving capacity
of the two species. Brain RNA sequencing analyses revealed interspecific differences in genes related to neuronal and
synaptic plasticity in the intrapallial neural populations (mesopallium and nidopallium), especially in the nidopallium
caudolaterale, a structure functionally analogous to the mammalian prefrontal cortex. At a finer scale, we discovered
robust differences in glutamate receptor expression between the species. In particular, the GRIN2B/GRIN2A ratio, known
tocorrelatewithsynaptic plasticity,was higherinthe innovative L.barbadensis.Thesefindings suggestthatdivergence in
avian intelligence is associated with similar neuronal mechanisms to that of mammals, including humans.
INTRODUCTION
Innovative problem solving is a key feature of intelligence and has
played a major role in the evolution of both human and non-human
animals. Growing evidence indicates that fundamental differences in in-
novative capacity and tool use are associated with the enlargement of
certainbrain structures, notably the cortexin primatesand the intrapallial
connected cell populations (also called associative pallium) in birds (1–3).
Beyond these differences in brain structure, however, we know very little
aboutthe processesthat controldivergence ininnovative problemsolving
at the neuronal level. In birds in particular, innovation has been well
studied, but detailed neurobiological investigations explaining natural
variation in innovative problem solving are still lacking (4, 5). The
outstanding cognitive capacities of birds, some species comparable to
those ofprimatesintermsof innovation andtooluse(6), havebeenpartly
explained by higher neuronal numbers in the forebrain of both taxa (7).
Here, we compared two closely related species of birds that show
extreme differences in foraging strategies despite being sympatric: the
innovative Barbados bullfinch Loxigilla barbadensis and the conserva-
tive black-faced grassquit Tiaris bicolor. The two species are close rela-
tives of Darwin’s finches and belong to the family Thraupidae (Fig. 1A)
(8), a neotropical clade that shows high rates of evolutionary diversifica-
tion, colonization, and feeding innovations in the wild (9). In Barbados,
the endemic L.barbadensis(Fig.1B) hasrecently evolvedfromtheLesser
Antillean bullfinch Loxigilla noctis (10) and frequently uses opportunistic,
innovative feeding behaviors that take advantage of anthropogenic foods
(11, 12). By contrast, T. bicolor (Fig. 1C) is conservative, shy, and feeds on
grassseed(13).Thetwospeciesareeachother’sclosestrelativeinBarbados
(Fig. 1A), where they overlap in their habitat use and are both territorial.
We used a battery of cognitive tasks on wild-caught birds to show
that differences in innovation in the field are matched by problem-
solving abilities in captivity. We further found that the two species have
different levels of expression of genes involved in synaptic plasticity in
the cell population types that are the functional avian equivalent of in-
tracortical cell layers of the mammalian cortex, more specifically the
prefrontal cortex. By correlating marked behavioral differences between
two closely related species with brain gene expression differences, we
have identified brain regions and candidate genes potentially involved
in the evolution of problem solving.
RESULTS
Laboratory tests confirm innovative differences
between species
To experimentally validate that the two species studied have differences
in innovative behavior, we captured adults of both species in mist nets in
Barbados, housed them in aviaries, and presented them with a battery of
problem-solving, learning, and boldness tests. The first test was an
obstacle-removalproblemdesignedtomimictechnicalinnovationsinthe
wild (fig. S1A) (14). Consistent with their divergence in innovativeness in
the field, we found a nearly all-or-none difference in problem solving
between the two species; 24 of the 29 L. barbadensis tested completed the
obstacle-removal task in a mean of 4.4 ± 1.09 trials, but none of the 15
T. bicolor tested succeeded before the maximum number of 15 trials
allowed (Fig. 1D). The poor performance of T. bicolor was not due to lack
of motivation: All individuals contacted the apparatus, and the amount of
time spent trying to solve it did not significantly differ between the two
species (fig. S2A). To eliminate the possibility that T. bicolor, which is
smaller than L. barbadensis, was physically incapable of solving the
task, we trained all the unsuccessful birds of both species for up to 60
trials (for the shaping procedure, see the Supplementary Materials
and fig. S2C). With our shaping, T. bicolor eventually solved the problem
(fig. S2D), albeit in 12 times more trials than the five L. barbadensis that
required shaping (fig. S2, B and E).
The problem-solving difference between L. barbadensis and T. bicolor
was accompanied by a difference of performance in a detour-reaching
task (fig. S1B). This test measures the ability to inhibit a behavior (direct

 reach) in the presence of an obstacle, forcing the individual to shift to
an alternative strategy to obtain a reward (food, in our case). Again,
L. barbadensis outperformed T. bicolor: They needed a lower number
of trials to reach the success criterion (Fig. 1E). The two species also
differed in two types of novelty responses linked to innovativeness,
namely, neophobia and boldness. In independent tests, L. barbadensis
tendedto be bolder(fig. S3A) andlessneophobic (fig.S3B) than T. bicolor
(see table S1 for all significant linear models using behavioral variables).
By contrast, the two species did not differ in two tasks that in-
volve stimulus learning (fig. S1C): color discrimination learning
(fig. S3C) and reversal learning (fig. S3D). The two closely related
thraupids are thus highly divergent for innovative problem solving,
but they are similar in terms of habitat preference, territoriality, and
stimulus learning, yielding a specific behavioral basis for brain and
genetic comparisons.
The species differ the most in transcriptomes of higher
forebrain pallial cell populations
In birds, species differences in innovativeness have been found to
be positively associated with allometrically corrected differences in
the size of specific brain subdivisions/cell populations. More specif-
ically, variations in innovation have been associated with the size of
the mesopallium and nidopallium (1–3), which have cell types
analogous to layers 3 and 2, respectively, of the mammalian cortex
(2, 15–19). These two cell populations in both birds and mammals
are responsible for the intrapallial and intracortical connections, re-
spectively, and are sometimes referred to collectively as the “asso-
ciative pallium” in birds (3, 19). The differences in problem solving
between L. barbadensis and T. bicolor were not reflected in differ-
ences in residual brain mass when plotted with other Thraupidae
(fig. S4).

 Therefore, we went to a deeper level, using molecular approaches, to
examine in progressively finerdetailthe expression levelsof genesin five
forebrain cell populations: the mesopallium, the nidopallium, the motor
arcopallium (tertiary pallium), the visual entopallium (a part of the
primary pallium), and the hippocampus (Fig. 2A). Within the nidopal-
lium, we separated out the nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL), a region of
the nidopallium proposed to be functionally analogous to the prefrontal
cortex (20). We dissected these pallial cell populations in ~400-mm-
thick midsagittal sections throughout as much of the brain as possible,
with fine dissection tools under a dissecting microscope. The mRNA
was extracted, and cDNA libraries were prepared and sequenced on
eight naïve (that is, different from the ones tested above) individuals
per species (see the Supplementary Materials for details). The resultant
~19.2 billion RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) reads (~200 million paired-end
readspersample)weremappedtothehigh-resolutionandwell-annotated
chicken (Gallus gallus) genome to obtain a nonbiased differential gene
expression analysis. Principal components analysis (PCA) of the mean
expression pattern for all genes in each region per species revealed larger
differences between regions than between species (Fig. 2B). Consistent
withprevious findings that were obtained by analyzing the expression of

 50 genes by in situ hybridization in the brains of a model songbird, the
zebra finch (16), the entopallium clustered furthest away from all the
other pallial populations and the intrapallial populations (associative
pallium: mesopallium and nidopallium, including the NCL), clustered
next to each other. Similarly, hierarchical cluster analysis revealed that
the entopallium was the most distant region from the others, whereas
the mesopallium and nidopallium were very similar to each other,
and the arcopallium and hippocampus were clustered together (fig.
S5A) (16). These findings indicate that our approach was successful at
revealing known molecular relationships between brain cell populations.
We next asked whether there were differences between species and
found in the principal component 2 (PC2) that the species differed the
leastintheentopalliumbutthemostinthehighest-orderconnectedregion,
the mesopallium, followed by the nidopallium and the NCL (Fig. 2B). This
was concordant with the total number of differentially expressed genes be-
tween species, with the mesopallium, nidopallium, and NCL showing the
highest number of differentially expressed genes (fig. S5B). Normalizing
with the total number of genes expressed in each region resulted in the
same rankings, whichmeansthat theobserved differencesare not simply
due to differences in the number of expressed genes per region (fig. S6A).
Because of the similarity in their expression and their potential co-
operative role in problem solving, we combined data from the me-
sopallium and the nidopallium (including the NCL), hereafter referred
to as the associative pallium, to perform GO analyses. GO clustering
revealed an overrepresentation of differentially expressed genes related
to synaptic signaling and localization and, to a lesser extent, myelina-
tion (Fig. 2C). Genes up-regulated in L. barbadensis were enriched for
functions of neurogenesis and axonogenesis, as well as cellular com-
munication and signaling (terms associated with neurotransmission;
Fig. 2C). Genes up-regulated in T. bicolor were enriched in nucleoside
metabolic processes, apoptosis, and ion transmembrane transport (Fig.
2C). Overall, genes related to specific neuronal and synaptic functions
appear to be the most represented in differentially expressed genes be-
tween the species.
Focusing on the genes that contain “neuron” or “synap” in any
of their GO terms, L. barbadensis had more up-regulated genes than
T. bicolor in their associative pallium (P c2 = 0.0075; Fig. 2D).
Focusing on the individual cell populations, NCL had the most up-
regulated genes in L. barbadensis compared to T. bicolor (P c2 =
0.0031; Fig. 2E). Selecting other sets of genes instead, for example,
genes that have “apopto” or “mitochondri” in their GO terms,
yielded no difference or differences in favor of T. bicolor (fig. S6, B
to E). Together, these results suggest that divergence in problem-
solving skills is associated with up-regulation of genes in higher-
order pallium populations and, to a greater extent, in the NCL within
the nidopallium and that those differences are specifically related to
neuronal and synaptic activity. This is in accordance with several
lines of evidence that suggest that the nidopallium and mesopallium
perform similar functions to upper layers of the mammalian cortex
and that the NCL is involved in higher sensory processing and asso-
ciative functions (20, 21).
Network analyses and in situ hybridizations reveal
glutamate receptors involved in neural plasticity
To further gain insight into which groups of genes covary between
species, we performed a coexpression network analysis, based on
hierarchical clustering, and discovered nine network modules that
were significantly associated with species (fig. S7A). Two modules
consisted of genes enriched in the GO terms synapse and adult be-
havior (also referred to as “adult behavioral response to stimulus”; Fig. 2F;
for all other modules see fig. S7B). The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glu-
tamate receptor subunits glutamate receptor ionotropic NMDA 1 (GRIN1)
and GRIN2B, known to promote synaptic plasticity (22, 23), were found in
these modules(Fig. 2F). Another metabotropic glutamate receptor (GRM2)
also involved in cognition (24) was up-regulated in L. barbadensis in a
cluster of genes enriched for organelle organization (fig. S7B).
This led us to analyze the expression of 18 glutamate receptors that
was detectable by RNA-seq among the various brain regions. We found
that four of five subunits of NMDA receptors and three of the five me-
tabotropic receptors were differentially expressed in the associative pal-
lium populations (Fig. 3A). The other receptors did not show significant
differences.
To validate the RNA-seq analyses and determine the specificity of
the anatomical profile, we performed in situ hybridization on the brains
of the two species (Fig. 3B). We confirmed that GRIN1 and GRIN2B
were broadly up-regulated in the mesopallium and nidopallium of
L. barbadensis, whereas GRIN2A was up-regulated in T. bicolor
(Fig. 3C). GRM2 was also significantly higher in T. bicolor compared
to L. barbadensis. Consistent with the RNA-seq analyses, none of the
AMPA or kainate glutamate receptors differed in expression be-
tween species (Fig. 3, B and C). GRIN3, GRM3, and GRM4 were dif-
ferentially expressed in the RNA-seq analysis, whereas differences in
GRIN3 and GRM4 expression in the in situ hybridization were not
significant once Bonferroni corrections were applied. Nevertheless,
both techniques showed very consistent results. Details on the ex-
pression of all glutamate receptors in individual regions by RNA-seq
and in situ hybridization are given in table S2.
The finding of contrasting species differences in GRIN2A and
GRIN2B expression is marked because these are the most acknowledged
types of glutamate receptor subunits linked with learning, memory, and
cognition, where they play opposite roles(25). In particular, the GRIN2B/
GRIN2A ratio is positively associated with the intensity of long-term
potentiation, long-term depression, dendritic spine density, and learning
proficiency(25–27).WethereforeinvestigatedthesetwoNMDAreceptors
morecloselyineachregionofthepallium,usingthemRNAquantification
data obtained from in situ hybridization (fig. S8A) and RNA-seq, as well
as protein levels quantified using immunohistochemistry performed
with GRIN2A- and GRIN2B-specific antibodies (fig. S8B). There was
a clear agreement in the results obtained from the three methods:
The GRIN2B/GRIN2A ratio was reliably higher in L. barbadensis in
all examined regions except the entopallium (Fig. 4, A to C), in line with
behavioral differences between the two species.
DISCUSSION
The all-or-none difference in problem solving between L. barbadensis
and T. bicolor we found here is likely the result of species-level evolu-
tionary divergence in behavior. It is less likely due to differential expe-
rience with the novel conditions of the urban habitat where both species
were captured: In a separate study (28), urban L. barbadensis were sig-
nificantly fasterthan ruralonesinsolving twoobstacle removalproblems,
but they still far outperformed the T. bicolor tested here. In our study,
L. barbadensis did not differ from T. bicolor in reversal learning, a
task that is presumed to require complex cognitive skills. This result
is in line with the comparison of rural versus urban L. barbadensis,
which differed in their problem-solving skills but not in their reversal
learning ability (28), in addition to increasing evidence that reversal
learning and problem-solving tasks measure different abilities (29).

 Because relative brain size is associated with innovation (1–3) and
similar neuron counts in primates and birds were hypothesized to be
responsible for comparable cognitive skills in both clades (7), it would
have been reasonable to predict that L. barbadensis would have a bigger
brain than T. bicolor, assuming that they have matching relative neuron
densities. However, our analysis revealed that their relative brain size
did not differ. Increases in pallial volume, neuronal density, and re-
ceptor expression thus appear to be different candidate ways in which
the information processing that underlies innovative problem solving
could be increased.
Our study is the first to link divergence in behavioral innovation in
the field, problem solving in captivity, and receptor expression levels in
thebrain. The receptors that are up-regulatedinL. barbadensisarethose
that promote neuronal plasticity (GRIN2B, GRIN1, and GRIN3),
whereas the ones that are up-regulated in T. bicolor are receptors that
diminish it (GRIN2A, GRM2, GRM3, and GRM4). The association
between the GRIN2B/GRIN2A ratio and behavioral divergence between
L. barbadensis and T. bicolor is particularly appealing, considering that
(i) this ratio is one of the most promising candidates to explain variation
in mammalian intelligence (27); (ii) in songbirds, this ratio changes in
the song-learning nuclei and is thought to contribute to changes in the
critical period for vocal learning as the animals become adults (30, 31);
and (iii) glutamate receptors are highly conserved (32) and their func-
tions are thought to be similar across species (33). Up to now, studies on
GRIN2B/GRIN2A ratio variation have been based on experimental
comparisons of transgenic or aging rodents and normal versus neuro-
logically diseased humans (27). Our finding of natural variation in this
ratio in wild, closely related species with divergent foraging strategies
provides an excellent opportunity to study the convergent evolution of
innovative problem solving, similar to that proposed for song learning
in birds and speech in humans (34). A next obvious step would be to
experimentally manipulate this ratio in the mesopallium and nidopallium
and determine whether changes in innovation behavior follow. In ad-
dition, although the role of NMDA receptors has been broadly assessed
in relation to some other behaviors in captive birds [for example, reversal
learning (35)], the link between individual subunits and especially the
GRIN2B/GRIN2A ratio and different behaviors have yet to be investi-
gated. Finally, because our study initiates a new research approach using
only two species, investigating the relationship between problem solving
and the GRIN2B/GRIN2A ratio in more species from different lineages
is important to determine the evolutionary importance of NMDA re-
ceptors for innovative skills.
METHODS
Animals
For behavioral analyses, 30 L. barbadensis of both sexes and 15 male
T. bicolor were captured using mist nets between February 2012 and
May 2012 in Holetown, Barbados. T. bicolor are sexually dichromatic;
the monomorphic L. barbadensis were sexed molecularly from blood
samples. Sex had no effect on our results. After capture, birds were
brought to aviaries and housed in individual cages visually but not
acoustically isolated from each other. After a 2-day habituation period
during which the birds were left undisturbed and fed ad libitum, they
were food-deprived overnight and tested on the next morning.
Behavioral tests
On the third day of captivity, we assessed boldness by presenting a petri
dish (same as during habituation period) full of seeds, hiding behind a
curtain, and measuring the latency to feed following withdrawal of the
experimenter. Birds were given a capped value of 1201 s if they did not
feed before the 20 min allotted. The obstacle-removal apparatus (see
picture of the task in fig. S1A) was then presented open and full of seeds
for the first time to measure avoidance of novel stimuli (“neophobia,”
latency to feed in the apparatus from which we subtracted the boldness
latency). Once the bird had fed from the open apparatus, the problem-
solving trial began, with the lid closed but loosely fitted. Birds were given
a maximum of 15 trials of 5 min (each trial being separated by 20 min)
to solve the problem, after which they were attributed a capped value of
16 trials. After this phase, unsuccessful birds were gradually trained
(shaped) to solve the task (see the Supplementary Materials for details
and fig. S2C) for up to 60 trials. Then, birds were given the detour-
reaching task (see picture of the task in fig. S1B). They were first trained
to reach a seed at the center of an opaque cylinder without pecking on
the sides for seven trials in a row, after which they were given a trans-
parent cylinder and had to perform with the same success criterion (see
the Supplementary Materials for details). The discrimination learning
task consisted of two colored platforms in which petri dishes were
placed, one with the seeds available and the other with the seeds glued
to the bottom of the dish so that there was no reward for choosing this
dish, although glued versus nonglued seeds were impossible to distin-
guish from a distance. The success criterion was set choosing the correct
(rewarded) color at seven trials in a row. On the following day, reversal
learning was assessed using the same protocol but with the rewarded
color switched with the previously unrewarded color.
RNA sequencing
A separate cohort of birds was captured to prevent the modulation of
brain mRNA caused by the stress of captivity and the experience of the
behavioral tests. A total of eight birds per species were used for the
RNA-seq experiments. After capture, the birds were decapitated, and
their brains were dissected and placed into RNAlater solution (catalog
# AM7021, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Brains were then sliced in thick
(400 mm) sections, and the regions of interest were dissected with small
scissors and a scapel under an Olympus dissecting microscope. RNA
from the six individual brain regions of the eight individuals for both
species was then extracted separately (for a total of 96 samples) using a
standard TRIzol extraction procedure. mRNA was purified using the
MicroPoly(A)Purist Kit (catalog # AM1919, Thermo Fisher Scientific),
which binds polyA regions on cellulose spin columns. Library prepara-
tions were then performed using a NextFlex Directional RNA-Seq Kit
(deoxyuridine triphosphate–based; catalog # 5129-06, Bioo Scientific;
see the Supplementary Materials for details). The samples were pooled
at a concentration of 200 mM (quantified using quantitative real-time
polymerase chain reaction) into six different lanes for high-output 2 ×
100–base pair paired-end sequencing. Bioinformatics analyses were
performed on the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences Odyssey Cluster
(see the Supplementary Materials for details). Briefly, the reads were
trimmed and then mapped to the G. gallus genome. The number of
aligned reads for each sample was compiled and used for differential
expression analysis, which was performed using DESeq2 (36). For the
associative pallium analyses, the model (reads ~ region + species) was
run to obtain a measure of the associative pallium while taking into ac-
count variation caused by individualregions. Forindividualregion analyses,
a one-factor model (reads ~ species) was run. The principal compo-
nents and hierarchical analyses were performed in DESeq as well.
GO enrichment analysis was performed using the DAVID 6.8 function-
al annotation clustering tool (37). The network analysis was performed

(38), using raw number of reads.
In situ hybridization
Another cohort of five naïve birds per species was captured for in situ
hybridization. Brain tissue hybridizations were performed, as described
in the study of Wada et al. (39). Briefly, 35S-labeled riboprobes were
made from T3, T7, or SP6 promoter sites of cDNA clones from the
study of Wada et al. (32) using T3, T7, or SP6 RNA polymerases
(Roche). Ten-micrometer fixed sections on slides were hybridized for
16 hours at 65°C. They were then washed, dehydrated, and exposed
in an autoradiography cassette with a Kodak BioMax MR film in the
dark at 4°C for 48 to 72 hours before developing the films. Optical den-
sities were then measured with ImageJ2. To assess differences in indi-
vidual regions (data presented in Fig. 4A, fig. S8, and table S2), we
performed two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using data from
all regions and report interspecific Bonferroni post-test comparisons
for each region. To test for differences in the associative pallium (data
presented in Fig. 3B), we performed two-way ANOVA and report dif-
ferences for the species factor and then applied Bonferroni corrections
for multiple comparisons.
Immunohistochemistry
The same animals from in situ hybridization were used for immuno-
histochemistry. Fixed sections were blocked using BLOXALL (catalog #
SP-6000, Vector Laboratories), rinsed, and incubated in normal
blocking serum. Sections were then incubated in 1:500 primary anti-
body (anti-GRIN2A, catalog # Ab118587; anti-GRIN2B, catalog #
Ab65783, Abcam) overnight at 4°C. They were then incubated with
appropriate secondary antibodies followed by avidin-biotin complex
reagent (catalog # PK-6100, Vector Laboratories). Finally, they were
washed and incubated in 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) peroxidase sub-
strate (catalog # SK-4100, Vector Laboratories) and coverslipped. They
were quantified the same way as in the in situ hybridization analysis.
